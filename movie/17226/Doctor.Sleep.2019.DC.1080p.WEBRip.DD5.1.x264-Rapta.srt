1
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,411
Where you going, Violet?

2
00:00:45,444 --> 00:00:47,413
Just to pick some flowers.

3
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:49,416
Don't wander too far.

4
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:27,787
♪ My wild Irish rose ♪

5
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:33,192

That grows ♪

9
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,474
Well, hi there.

10
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:50,610
Where did you find those?

11
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:53,246
I know all the secret places.

12
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,647
Do you want one?

13
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,892
You're wondering
why I'm wearing

14
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,227
such a funny hat.

15
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,897
I always wear this hat.

16
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,599
So much, it's a part of
my name now.

17
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,535
My friends...

18
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:19,772
my very, very best friends,
they just call me Rose the Hat.

19
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:22,875
It looks like a magician's hat.

20
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:24,610
It is.

21
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:27,213
It's a magic hat.

22
00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:28,314
Do you wanna see?

23
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:31,684
Nothing up my sleeves.

24
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,588
Nothing in my hat.

25
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,792
Don't worry, that's my friend.

26
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:41,727
You're missing the trick.

27
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,463
Reach inside.

28
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,869
Wow!

29
00:02:49,902 --> 00:02:51,270
It's so pretty.

30
00:02:51,303 --> 00:02:52,738
Because it's special.

31
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:54,874
And speaking of special,

32
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:57,177
you're a little magic, too,
aren't you?

33
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,748
The flower in my hand,
what color is it?

34
00:03:03,682 --> 00:03:05,785
Oh, it's okay, honey.

35
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,921
You won't scare me. I promise.

36
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:10,790
Purple.

37
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:18,231
Violet...

38
00:03:18,797 --> 00:03:20,333
like you.

39
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,238
You don't eat flowers.

40
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,405
But you do.

41
00:03:26,438 --> 00:03:28,708
But these are special.

42
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:32,478
Honey, it's the special ones
that taste best.

43
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:37,550
I should get back to my mom.

44
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:40,353
No, stay. Stay awhile.
See more magic.

45
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,726
Ow.

46
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,793
You are
a special little thing,

47
00:03:47,826 --> 00:03:48,628
aren't you?

48
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:55,701
Violet?

49
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:58,638
Violet!

50
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:06,746
Violet!

51
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:10,683
Vi...

52
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:44,163
Please.

53
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,573
Hey. It's okay, Doc.

54
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,175
It's okay.

55
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,516
There.

56
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:04,984
All dry.

57
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:08,020
Phew.

58
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:09,689
What happened?

59
00:08:12,724 --> 00:08:14,927
You have to talk to me, Danny.

60
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:18,631
You haven't talked
since we left...

61
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:21,801
Please, Doc.

62
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,538
Please.

63
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:18,057
So...

64
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,893
you ain't talking, huh, Doc?

65
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:28,134
Weren't talking much first time
I met you neither.

66
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,237
Little boy...

67
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:36,742
set to spend a long winter
at that rotten old place.

68
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:39,078
Just him and his mommy
and daddy.

69
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,948
Daddy as dark as
that boy is bright.

70
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:45,050
And, boy, is he bright.

71
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,787
He's shining like fire...

72
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,156
in the one place...

73
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:53,893
the worst place for
someone who shines.

74
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:59,098
You remember the first time
we really talked?

75
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:02,801
When I spoke up
inside your head?

76
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:05,070
Made you feel good, right?

77
00:10:05,103 --> 00:10:06,939
Knowing you weren't alone.

78
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:08,341
Daddy tried to kill me.

79
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,211
It wasn't all him,
you gotta know.

80
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:17,016
That place fed his dark,
like it fed on your light.

81
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,285
And he had
some light in him, too.

82
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,055
Just like you got some dark.

83
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:25,090
We all got both.

84
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:26,759
It's not done with me.

85
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,865
It ever strike you funny
how I showed up when I did?

86
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,867
When you needed me.

87
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,203
Someone did that for me, too.

88
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:41,106
My grandma taught me,

89
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:43,142
and I taught you.

90
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:47,346
And some day, Danny Torrance,
you'll teach someone else.

91
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:48,781
I won't.

92
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:51,016
Oh, you won't, huh?

93
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:52,751
I won't shine, I mean.

94
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:55,221
No more. It's dangerous.

95
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:59,191
Reckon it is sometimes.

96
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:01,694
She found me.

97
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,996
She'll come back and come back
until she gets me.

98
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,032
You're right.

99
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:09,268
The Overlook's condemned.
Boarded up.

100
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,036
They're starvin' old ghosts,

101
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:13,138
and they're reachin' out
for you.

102
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:15,274
Won't stop with her, either.

103
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,443
Pictures in a book.

104
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:20,112
You said they were just pictures in
a book and they couldn't hurt me.

105
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,184
Some things,

106
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:29,188
dark things,
the shining's like food.

107
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,924
They're mosquitoes
landing for blood.

108
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:36,361
The Overlook,

109
00:11:36,394 --> 00:11:40,265
it was always
just pictures to me.

110
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:42,868
But I didn't shine like you.

111
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,805
Nobody shines like you.

112
00:11:46,838 --> 00:11:51,376
So, you in that damn hotel, you
was like a million-watt battery

113
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,145
all plugged in.

114
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:54,279
And it ate it up.

115
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:55,981
You made it real.

116
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:59,852
Started soon as you
walked through the door.

117
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,187
Can't do nothing about that,
I'm sorry to tell you,

118
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,422
but you're not a child.

119
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,457
You're older now.

120
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,760
Much older, in a way.

121
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,261
You gotta hear this.

122
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:13,899
World's a hungry place.

123
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:17,903
And the darkest things are the
hungriest, and they'll eat what shines.

124
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:21,306
Swarm it like mosquitoes
or leeches.

125
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:23,042
Can't do nothing about that.

126
00:12:25,477 --> 00:12:28,247
What you can do...

127
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,817
is turn what they come for
against 'em.

128
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,289
My grandfather,

129
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:40,960
he was a mean son of a bitch.

130
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,163
Dark inside.

131
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,932
Same type of dark as your dad.

132
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:49,434
Beat me senseless,
and my grandma, too,

133
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:52,137
and when he died, I danced.

134
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,907
But he kept on coming back.

135
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,243
Standing in my room.

136
00:12:58,276 --> 00:13:00,946
Suit all gray and stinkin'

137
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:03,783
from whatever mold was
growin' on him in that box.

138
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,522
One day, he grabbed me,
and he was real.

139
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:12,891
His nails were long

140
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:14,293
from growing in the grave,

141
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:17,095
and they cut me, Doc.

142
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:18,898
Cut me deep.

143
00:13:20,131 --> 00:13:21,901
So, Grandma,

144
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:26,806
she taught me a trick.

145
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,810
Gave me a present.

146
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,015
I want you to know this box...

147
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:38,984
inside and out.

148
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:41,220
Don't just look at it.
Touch it.

149
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:45,991
Stick your nose inside
and see if there's a smell.

150
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,428
Know every corner,

151
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,530
every single thing.

152
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:53,432
Why?

153
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:57,436
Because you're gonna build one
just like it in your mind.

154
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,138
One even more special.

155
00:14:01,973 --> 00:14:04,310
So next time
that bitch comes around,

156
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:07,913
you'll be ready.

157
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:13,051
Let's get you back to Mama.

158
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:15,020
Wendy'll worry,

159
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:18,057
and she shouldn't have to worry
another day in her life.

160
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:22,862
That woman's paid her debt.

161
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:28,400
Danny!

162
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:31,470
Danny!

163
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:35,507
Danny!

164
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,944
There you are.

165
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:41,046
Where did you go, huh?

166
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,650
You scared me half to death.

167
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:49,254
Don't you do that to me.
You hear?

168
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:51,957
Don't you ever do that to me.

169
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,359
Don't ever do that to me.

170
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:03,302
Eh, what's up, Doc?

171
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,470
What's the bit?

172
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:08,507
What's cookin'?

173
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,610
What's cooking,
little friend? Why, you are.

174
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:13,145
Me?

175
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,648
Why, yes.

176
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:20,386
Ouch! You're killing me!

177
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,055
Ouch!

178
00:15:29,027 --> 00:15:31,430
Agony! Agony!

179
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,703
Let me see now.

180
00:16:11,736 --> 00:16:14,439
It is obvious that
this is no ordinary rabbit.

181
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:19,144
Therefore, I must dream up a brilliant
master strategy, ingenious...

182
00:16:19,177 --> 00:16:20,579
You okay, Doc?

183
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,181
Now, uh, what if I lured him...

184
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:25,250
- Yeah, Mom. I'm okay.
- ...into a rock crusher?

185
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:27,419
Nah, nah, nah,
too complicated.

186
00:16:27,452 --> 00:16:31,189
Yeah, yeah,
too complicated. But what if I...

187
00:16:31,222 --> 00:16:33,125
Uh-uh,
too much detail.

188
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,526
Right.
Too much detail.

189
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:01,386
And what's
your name again, cutie?

190
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:02,454
Dan.

191
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:03,522
Dan.

192
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:40,592
I was having a drink
with the lady, all right?

193
00:17:58,376 --> 00:18:03,648
Hey. You're gonna
take your medicine.

194
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:04,516
Get off him.

195
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:05,784
Get up. Get out of here.

196
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,507
Shit.
I think you killed him.

197
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,343
What if you killed him?

198
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,844
I hope you killed him.

199
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:34,613
You hear me?

200
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:37,616
Let me kiss it better.

201
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:48,694
No.

202
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:51,496
No, no, no.

203
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:53,732
No, no, no, no, no, no.

204
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:57,169
Whoa. What the... No.

205
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,714
Mommy?

206
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,424
What's your name, hero?

207
00:19:57,562 --> 00:19:59,631
- Mommy?
- Baby.

208
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:02,467
Here, here.

209
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,843
You can put
her money back, Doc.

210
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:14,279
You can do that much.

211
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:16,014
She took mine.

212
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:18,883
She probably bought the coke
with it.

213
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,285
Doc.

214
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:34,332
No, no, Doc.

215
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:35,967
You can put things from
the Overlook away in boxes,

216
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,869
but not memories.

217
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:40,672
Never those.

218
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:43,008
They're the real ghosts.

219
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,010
You take them with you.

220
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:29,587
Time for bed, Abra.

221
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,323
A little more.

222
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:32,757
No more, sweetie.

223
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,392
Big day tomorrow.

224
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:35,593
- Birthday party!
- That's right.

225
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:36,628
Yeah.

226
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:38,363
Now, what time is it?

227
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:40,532
- Bedtime.
- You know it's bedtime.

228
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:43,535
Good night, sweetheart.

229
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:02,180

Henri wants us to finish
this bottle and then three more.

235
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,769
Andi?

236
00:23:24,802 --> 00:23:25,570
Says he'll water
his garden with champagne...

237
00:23:25,603 --> 00:23:27,172
That's right.

238
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,207
...before he'll let
the Germans drink it.

239
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,708
This sort of takes the
sting out of being occupied.

240
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:32,577
You're prettier
than your picture.

241
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,611
- Doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
- You said it.

242
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:35,547
And you're older than yours.

243
00:23:37,114 --> 00:23:41,119
Are we staying here
or going somewhere?

244
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:45,623
Don't you wanna
watch the movie?

245
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:00,572
I don't see
what the fuss is about.

246
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,773
Chat room romance.

247
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:04,476
Little gross. Not interesting.

248
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,512
Just watch.
It's interesting, I promise.

249
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:10,482
Well, it better be, 'cause
she's not all that steamy.

250
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:13,485
And there she goes.

251
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,220
Aren't you tired?

252
00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:18,223
Sleep.

253
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,102
Okay.

254
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:40,712
Wait. This is the best part.

255
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:43,248
I watched her do it three times
now and it never gets old.

256
00:24:45,082 --> 00:24:46,885
Sleep deeper,

257
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,754
deep as you can.

258
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:53,191
The pain you feel
is only a dream.

259
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,528
What will the pain be?

260
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,598
A dream.

261
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:06,204
You can explain a lost wallet

262
00:25:06,237 --> 00:25:09,173
when your wife asks.

263
00:25:09,206 --> 00:25:11,676
But you can't explain this.

264
00:25:13,244 --> 00:25:16,615
This you'll see every day
when you look in the mirror.

265
00:25:17,882 --> 00:25:20,118
And every time you see it,

266
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,587
you'll say out loud...

267
00:25:24,121 --> 00:25:27,325
"I like little girls."

268
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:29,828
You'll say it out loud.

269
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,931
Out loud.

270
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:38,770
And the next time you go looking
for a little girl online,

271
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,839
I want you to
remember that time

272
00:25:41,872 --> 00:25:43,975
you got bit by a snake.

273
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:48,279
A snake in a white blouse

274
00:25:48,312 --> 00:25:50,115
whose face is a blank.

275
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,060
- That is interesting.
- Mm-hmm.

276
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:13,705
Excuse me, miss?

277
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,207
Miss. Miss, you left something
in the theater.

278
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,576
You wanna leave me alone.

279
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:27,285
Well, hi there.

280
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:29,988
You wanna let me go.

281
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:33,992
Oh, no, sweetie.

282
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:36,861
No, I don't.

283
00:27:35,252 --> 00:27:37,255
How far can I get for this?

284
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:05,950
Four of spades.
What color is this?

285
00:28:05,983 --> 00:28:08,920
Mommy, I made this for you.
It's a secret card.

286
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:10,788
Mm,
thank you, Abba-doo.

287
00:28:10,821 --> 00:28:13,491
Does anyone know a magic word?

288
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:17,261
- Ooh, ooh.
- Uh... You.

289
00:28:17,294 --> 00:28:18,930
Abracadabra.

290
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,331
Abracadabra.
That's a great one.

291
00:28:20,364 --> 00:28:22,701
Okay, you hold the magic wand.

292
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:25,837
Now, everyone,

293
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,806
on the count of three, okay?

294
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:31,743
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

295
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:35,213
Abracadabra.

296
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:37,248
I know magic, too.

297
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:41,419
Well, then you get to hold him,
birthday girl.

298
00:28:41,452 --> 00:28:44,856
- There you go. You got him?
- Oh.

299
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,525
For my next trick...
Oh, my goodness. Sorry.

300
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:49,961
Sometimes, if I...

301
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,497
Sorry.

302
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,932
Has anyone seen my spoons?

303
00:28:54,965 --> 00:28:56,768
I can do that.

304
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,336
That's nice, sweetie.

305
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,871
- They're on you!
- Oh, they're on me?

306
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,172
Okay, make sure you guys
don't do this.

307
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:03,341
Oh!

308
00:29:13,217 --> 00:29:15,953
Uh... We can forget
about naptime.

309
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:17,789
- Just a few more hours.
- Mm.

310
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,861
Say it with me.
"Just a few more hours."

311
00:29:23,894 --> 00:29:25,463
Just a few more hours.

312
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:33,204
What the hell?

313
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:43,448
Dave...

314
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:58,062
Abracadabra.

315
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,136
Oops.

316
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:41,205
Well, hi there, sleepyhead.

317
00:30:41,238 --> 00:30:42,907
Sorry.

318
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,276
I had to sleep you pretty hard.

319
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:47,278
You're a tough one.

320
00:30:47,311 --> 00:30:48,913
Willful.

321
00:30:48,946 --> 00:30:50,548
You know, I checked.

322
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:53,084
Six men in three months

323
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:56,487
with those little snakebite
tattoos on their cheeks.

324
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,356
Why, you've been busy.

325
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:08,933
Snakebite Andi,
that's who you are.

326
00:31:08,966 --> 00:31:11,269
So, who am I?

327
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,474
You're some crazy bitch
who kidnapped me.

328
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,209
Just the truth from now on.

329
00:31:18,242 --> 00:31:20,345
You will only speak the truth.

330
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:26,183
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

331
00:31:26,216 --> 00:31:30,221
My God. Works a little
too well, don't it?

332
00:31:30,254 --> 00:31:33,224
Here's the deal,
Snakebite Andi.

333
00:31:33,257 --> 00:31:36,961
You're a pusher, hmm?
You can push people.

334
00:31:36,994 --> 00:31:39,297
We haven't had a pusher
around here for a little while,

335
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:44,135
so I'm gonna offer you a deal I haven't
offered anyone in almost 40 years.

336
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,906
How old are you, darlin'?

337
00:31:49,373 --> 00:31:50,708
Fifteen.

338
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:52,510
Fifteen?

339
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:55,713
Oh, God, what an age.

340
00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:58,983
Springtime of your womanhood,
isn't it?

341
00:31:59,016 --> 00:32:01,986
Mm. You're not a girl anymore,

342
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:05,690
but you don't have
a single dent yet either.

343
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:08,259
Gravity hasn't even
noticed you.

344
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:10,428
Not at 15.

345
00:32:12,129 --> 00:32:13,264
Men, though...

346
00:32:14,698 --> 00:32:16,200
No, no, no. No shame.

347
00:32:17,634 --> 00:32:22,239
You paid that back, didn't you?

348
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,710
That's what I'm offering you.
Springtime forever.

349
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:28,145
Ten years from now,
you're still 15.

350
00:32:28,178 --> 00:32:30,448
A hundred, maybe 17.

351
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:33,551
Eat well,

352
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:37,388
stay young, live long.

353
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,460
So, you and your friend...

354
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:45,596
Mm, not my friend.
That's my family.

355
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:48,066
We're the True Knot, dear.

356
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,336
The True Knot.

357
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:56,507
What's tied
can never be untied.

358
00:34:10,414 --> 00:34:11,382
You like it?

359
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:13,684
Oh. Sorry. I was just...

360
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:17,088
That's okay.
People love to look at it.

361
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:19,090
We used to set this up
in the library.

362
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:22,359
Community project,
just taking a life all its own.

363
00:34:22,392 --> 00:34:24,361
See, we started with
the clock tower there.

364
00:34:24,394 --> 00:34:27,098
- Oh, yeah.
- Just keeps growing.

365
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,532
Kids call it Teenytown.

366
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:29,834
The kids build this?

367
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,602
With some help, oh, yeah.

368
00:34:31,635 --> 00:34:34,372
Keep it up,
build the whole town square.

369
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:40,478
Are you off the bus
or riding your thumb?

370
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:41,812
Yeah, the bus.

371
00:34:41,845 --> 00:34:44,448
Oh. Not many ride the bus
this far north.

372
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:47,385
Unless they're looking
for work.

373
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,422
Yeah.

374
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:54,391
Change of scenery,

375
00:34:54,424 --> 00:34:57,095
or you running away
from something?

376
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,397
Oh, don't mind me.
I hope I'm...

377
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,599
New face is all.

378
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,234
Yeah.

379
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,803
Guess I'm running away
from myself, I guess.

380
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,906
Oh, yeah.

381
00:35:08,939 --> 00:35:14,378
I know that look.
Too well, I'm sorry to say.

382
00:35:14,411 --> 00:35:18,249
Running away from yourself.
That is a pickle.

383
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,851
You take yourself
with you wherever you go.

384
00:35:20,884 --> 00:35:24,822
- Ain't that the bitch?
- Mm-hmm.

385
00:35:24,855 --> 00:35:26,323
Rent's 85 a week,

386
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:27,725
payable up front.

387
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:31,262
Billy paid your first two,
rest's on you.

388
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,899
No pets, no parties, no noise.

389
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,568
I'm a quiet tenant.

390
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:41,705
Last guy said the same.
Math student.

391
00:35:41,738 --> 00:35:43,607
Even let him paint the wall
all blackboard,

392
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,644
so he could scribble
his little puzzles up there.

393
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,547
Wasn't quiet. No, sir.

394
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,816
Didn't even paint over this when he
left, but I'm glad he didn't,

395
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:55,419
'cause I can make this
easy for ya,

396
00:35:55,452 --> 00:35:57,421
so you see it every morning
when you wake.

397
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:02,693
You sure you wanna
vouch for this pup?

398
00:36:02,726 --> 00:36:04,228
Pretty sure.

399
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:05,496
It's your ass, Billy.

400
00:36:06,563 --> 00:36:08,533
Bleedin' heart, this one.

401
00:36:10,934 --> 00:36:14,471
I'm downstairs, ground floor,
if you need anything.

402
00:36:14,504 --> 00:36:17,241
Find me tomorrow,
talk about some work.

403
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:20,778
Why are you doing this?

404
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,346
You don't know me.

405
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:24,348
No, I don't.

406
00:36:24,381 --> 00:36:27,251
But I know the look,
like I said.

407
00:36:27,284 --> 00:36:30,688
And sometimes I get this
feeling about people.

408
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,624
- Hard to understand, I guess.
- Mm.

409
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:35,493
Easier than you think.

410
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:38,629
- Thanks.
- All right.

411
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,285
You ready?

412
00:37:03,787 --> 00:37:04,989
She's ready.

413
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,829
Who...
Who are these people?

414
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:14,465
You'll find out after.

415
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,367
That over there
is Grampa Flick...

416
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,436
and he'll lead us. Lie down.

417
00:37:18,935 --> 00:37:20,304
There.

418
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:28,445
No fear. You understand?

419
00:37:36,753 --> 00:37:38,489
We are the True Knot

420
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,325
and we endure.

421
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,729
We are the chosen ones.

422
00:37:47,864 --> 00:37:50,868
We are the fortunate ones.

423
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:58,009
What is tied cannot be untied.

424
00:38:00,877 --> 00:38:02,747
Here is a woman.

425
00:38:03,647 --> 00:38:05,349
Would she join us?

426
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:11,822
Would she tie her life
to our life?

427
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:13,524
Yes.

428
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:14,958
Yes.

429
00:38:14,991 --> 00:38:17,061
Say yes.

430
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,598
Yes.

431
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,001
This one's special.

432
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:26,770
Her name's Violet.

433
00:38:26,803 --> 00:38:28,439
There's not much of her left.

434
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,508
And she tastes...

435
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,546
...like flowers.

436
00:38:57,834 --> 00:38:59,603
Breathe deep.

437
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,381
There. Embrace it.

438
00:39:14,451 --> 00:39:15,853
Embrace it.

439
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,499
No!

440
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:33,137
No! No!

441
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,925
They haven't
found us yet.

442
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,062
They were used to
hearing him cry

443
00:40:32,095 --> 00:40:34,665
'cause I left him alone
so much.

444
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,136
So they didn't do anything.

445
00:40:42,205 --> 00:40:44,775
And they haven't found us yet.

446
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,452
Mommy?

447
00:41:18,074 --> 00:41:20,544
Oh, hey.

448
00:41:20,577 --> 00:41:23,714
Uh, you said that
you knew my look.

449
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:25,483
Well, what did you mean?

450
00:41:26,783 --> 00:41:27,952
Brother...

451
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:31,121
you're sick.

452
00:41:31,154 --> 00:41:33,224
You're tired.
I can see that much.

453
00:41:35,325 --> 00:41:38,696
But you're sick and tired
of being sick and tired.

454
00:41:41,998 --> 00:41:43,701
I need help.

455
00:41:47,804 --> 00:41:49,239
Come on in.

456
00:41:49,272 --> 00:41:51,008
We'll talk about it.

457
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:58,782
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

458
00:41:58,815 --> 00:42:01,018
the courage
to change the things I can,

459
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:03,887
and the wisdom to
know the difference.

460
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,889
Well, Bobbie's got
a big birthday today.

461
00:42:05,922 --> 00:42:07,324
Three years. Three years sober.

462
00:42:07,357 --> 00:42:09,193
Yeah.

463
00:42:12,195 --> 00:42:13,263
I'm so proud of you.

464
00:42:13,296 --> 00:42:14,832
Thanks, John.

465
00:42:18,935 --> 00:42:21,071
Now, am I forgetting anybody?

466
00:42:21,104 --> 00:42:24,141
Does anybody got a year?
Or six months?

467
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:26,143
Well, now for the most
important person in the room.

468
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:29,013
Is, uh, anybody here a newbie?

469
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,716
Somebody got 24 hours?

470
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:36,654
Yeah.

471
00:42:44,327 --> 00:42:46,129
New to town, huh?

472
00:42:46,162 --> 00:42:48,265
Yeah, I, uh...

473
00:42:48,298 --> 00:42:50,300
Nothing personal.
I delivered half the people in the room.

474
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,636
- Just new faces pop, that's all.
- This here is Dan Torrance.

475
00:42:52,669 --> 00:42:54,705
- He's fresh off the bus.
- Hey.

476
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,974
Fresh off the ground,
by the look.

477
00:42:57,774 --> 00:42:58,942
Oh.

478
00:42:58,975 --> 00:43:00,677
There's no judgment here,
brother.

479
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,112
I mean, we've all been there.

480
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:04,281
- And worse, trust me.
- Oh, yeah.

481
00:43:04,314 --> 00:43:07,150
Doc, he's served our town
most my life.

482
00:43:07,183 --> 00:43:08,385
Delivered my baby brother.

483
00:43:08,418 --> 00:43:10,120
Yeah.
How is Frankie these days?

484
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:13,190
Well, he'll find his way back.

485
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,859
You know, he's got a good heart
under it all.

486
00:43:15,892 --> 00:43:19,696
Billy really tried with him.
Well, we all did.

487
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:22,332
Well, Billy, you know, if you're
looking for a wing to climb under...

488
00:43:22,365 --> 00:43:24,034
- -...I can't
say you'll do any better

489
00:43:24,067 --> 00:43:26,036
than Billy Freeman here.

490
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:28,339
Thank you for your hospitality.
I...

491
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:32,042
I'm a little, uh...

492
00:43:32,075 --> 00:43:33,977
I guess I'm not used to it.

493
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,879
Well, you know we say,

494
00:43:35,912 --> 00:43:37,381
"You can't judge someone till
you know their whole story."

495
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,049
You might think you understand,

496
00:43:39,082 --> 00:43:41,785
- but you don't.
- You don't.

497
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:43,120
So, how are you today?
All right?

498
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:44,354
Train's still running.

499
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:46,690
That's good to hear.

500
00:43:46,723 --> 00:43:47,858
You good?

501
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:50,193
Yeah. Yeah.

502
00:43:50,226 --> 00:43:51,395
Well, good to know you, Dan.

503
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:52,796
- Yeah.
- Come again.

504
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:54,031
- Thanks.
- Hope to see you again soon.

505
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:56,767
I'll... I'll come back, yeah.

506
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,369
Really good man.
He's got a gift...

507
00:43:59,402 --> 00:44:01,171
Yeah. Hey, Billy, hang on.

508
00:44:01,204 --> 00:44:02,706
Hey, Doc.

509
00:44:04,741 --> 00:44:07,344
Your watch. Uh...

510
00:44:07,377 --> 00:44:10,447
You lost your watch.
You were worried about the kid with, uh...

511
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,182
Goocher's.

512
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:15,385
What?

513
00:44:15,418 --> 00:44:19,857
The kid with Goocher's or
Gaucher's. The bone thing.

514
00:44:22,325 --> 00:44:24,194
Gaucher's disease.

515
00:44:24,227 --> 00:44:25,929
Right.

516
00:44:25,962 --> 00:44:27,264
You were washing your hands
in the hospital bathroom

517
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,767
and you left it
on the soap dispenser.

518
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,938
Well, just check
on the soap dispenser.

519
00:44:34,971 --> 00:44:36,874
- It's good to meet you.
- Yeah.

520
00:44:42,145 --> 00:44:43,380
How did you know?

521
00:44:44,914 --> 00:44:46,984
I wish I could say. Uh...

522
00:44:48,284 --> 00:44:49,853
Lucky guess.

523
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,325
My ass.

524
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:59,163
Intuition, I suppose. Like a
feeling in my gut. Maybe a...

525
00:45:00,797 --> 00:45:02,899
A lucky guess.

526
00:45:02,932 --> 00:45:04,802
What do you wanna do here?

527
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:07,404
What do you mean?

528
00:45:07,437 --> 00:45:10,307
I mean here in Frazier.
Why are you here?

529
00:45:11,374 --> 00:45:12,843
And don't bullshit me, Dan.

530
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,946
I'm prone to
gut feelings of my own.

531
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:19,382
I don't know. I don't know.

532
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:22,820
Something different
than I've been doing.

533
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:26,190
Something better.

534
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,459
Anything's better, frankly.

535
00:45:29,492 --> 00:45:31,095
You go to church?

536
00:45:32,028 --> 00:45:33,396
Does it matter?

537
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:35,432
Do you believe in something?
Something...

538
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:38,869
bigger than you?

539
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:44,141
Our... Our beliefs
don't make us better people.

540
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,510
Our actions
make us better people.

541
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:51,281
So, Billy says you have
orderly experience.

542
00:45:51,314 --> 00:45:52,983
That's right.

543
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:54,551
You workin' right now?

544
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:58,054
A few shifts at Teenytown.
Helping with the train.

545
00:45:58,087 --> 00:46:01,491
'Cause I do three days a week
at Rivington House, the hospice.

546
00:46:01,524 --> 00:46:03,794
Good orderly is tough to find.

547
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:04,995
Tougher to keep.

548
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,565
Do dying people bother you?

549
00:46:08,598 --> 00:46:10,333
No.

550
00:46:10,366 --> 00:46:11,935
We're all dying.

551
00:46:11,968 --> 00:46:14,938
The world is one big hospice
with fresh air.

552
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:16,206
Hmm.

553
00:47:04,554 --> 00:47:05,823
Wow.

554
00:47:06,956 --> 00:47:08,926
Well, hi there.

555
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:13,130
- How long was I...
- Oh, few days.

556
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:15,833
You said it didn't hurt.

557
00:47:18,301 --> 00:47:21,271
Doesn't now, does it?

558
00:47:21,304 --> 00:47:23,106
- Felt like I was dying.
- Mm.

559
00:47:24,207 --> 00:47:25,542
I know.

560
00:47:25,575 --> 00:47:27,144
You did.

561
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:30,947
You brought me back.

562
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,916
You'll feel better
when you eat.

563
00:47:32,949 --> 00:47:34,318
Am I still human?

564
00:47:35,952 --> 00:47:38,088
Do you care?

565
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:40,423
♪ It's all forgotten now ♪

566
00:47:40,456 --> 00:47:43,126
♪ The trouble and the pain ♪

567
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:46,196
♪ Forgotten,
Every word I said ♪

568
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,601
♪ Forgotten,
Every tear you shed ♪

569
00:47:51,634 --> 00:47:54,271
♪ We're still in love ♪

570
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:58,542
There you go.

571
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:04,147
What is it?

572
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:07,618
You're scared of me.

573
00:48:09,085 --> 00:48:10,320
Oh...

574
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:15,192
We love you more than anything
in the world.

575
00:48:17,093 --> 00:48:18,128
You hear me?

576
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:20,597
Anything.

577
00:48:23,366 --> 00:48:24,468
Goodnight, my heart.

578
00:49:08,177 --> 00:49:11,081
Hey. Let him be.

579
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,718
Azreel, leave him be.

580
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:26,430
Azzie?

581
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:29,032
Azzie, come on.

582
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,535
Come on. Azzie.

583
00:49:32,568 --> 00:49:33,704
Doc.

584
00:49:34,804 --> 00:49:37,040
That you, Doc?

585
00:49:37,073 --> 00:49:38,408
No, I'm not a doctor.

586
00:49:38,441 --> 00:49:40,577
Do you want me to
get you a doctor?

587
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,212
The cat's on my bed.

588
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:43,680
Oh, hey, I'll move her.

589
00:49:43,713 --> 00:49:45,281
No.

590
00:49:45,314 --> 00:49:47,450
I knew she would be.

591
00:49:47,483 --> 00:49:51,654
That cat always
seems to know...

592
00:49:53,489 --> 00:49:55,125
When it's time.

593
00:49:56,759 --> 00:49:59,396
- I guess it's time.
- No.

594
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:02,132
It's just Azzie
being a silly old cat.

595
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,267
Nope.

596
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,670
Been that way
ever since I got here.

597
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:09,739
The cat knows

598
00:50:09,772 --> 00:50:12,208
when it's time to go to sleep.

599
00:50:12,241 --> 00:50:14,244
Everybody knows that.

600
00:50:15,745 --> 00:50:17,748
I'm gonna die.

601
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,627
Yes.

602
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,728
Let me get you someone.

603
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:33,163
No.

604
00:50:34,764 --> 00:50:37,701
Known it was comin'.

605
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:42,105
Doesn't make it less scary.

606
00:50:42,138 --> 00:50:43,540
Yeah.

607
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,775
But maybe
it's just like you say,

608
00:50:45,808 --> 00:50:48,711
just going to sleep.

609
00:50:48,744 --> 00:50:52,315
I mean, there's nothing scary.
It's just sleeping.

610
00:50:52,348 --> 00:50:54,717
You're a strange
type of doctor.

611
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,519
I told you, I'm not a doctor.

612
00:50:56,552 --> 00:50:58,488
Oh, I think you are.

613
00:50:59,355 --> 00:51:01,324
Doctor Sleep.

614
00:51:01,357 --> 00:51:04,661
Doc, I am so scared
it's gonna hurt, or be dark,

615
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:08,131
or... or be nothing at all.
And I don't wanna...

616
00:51:08,164 --> 00:51:10,267
Nothing to be scared of.

617
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:13,870
Just going to sleep.

618
00:51:13,903 --> 00:51:18,575
Finally, true, restful sleep.

619
00:51:22,578 --> 00:51:24,347
Oh, thank you.

620
00:51:25,481 --> 00:51:28,785
Thank you, Doc.

621
00:51:28,818 --> 00:51:31,521
Look, I shouldn't be here.
Let me go get you some...

622
00:51:31,554 --> 00:51:32,789
No, no, no.

623
00:51:32,822 --> 00:51:36,560
You're exactly
where you should be.

624
00:51:38,928 --> 00:51:40,564
Exactly.

625
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:47,104
I see my wife.

626
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:13,550
Dan, alcoholic.

627
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,752
Hi, Dan.

628
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:18,388
I'm not much of
a speech guy.

629
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:22,626
I just thought I'd hold the chip
and talk about whatever popped up.

630
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,895
So, here I am.

631
00:54:29,765 --> 00:54:31,935
And I'm thinkin' about my dad.

632
00:54:34,103 --> 00:54:37,073
I saw a chip like this
in his hand once.

633
00:54:37,106 --> 00:54:39,075
A couple months before he died.

634
00:54:39,108 --> 00:54:41,011
Five month chip,
I'm pretty sure.

635
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:48,385
He hurt me once
when he was drunk.

636
00:54:49,385 --> 00:54:50,654
Broke my arm.

637
00:54:51,687 --> 00:54:53,456
Then he dried right out.

638
00:54:56,826 --> 00:55:00,463
He died when I was five, so the
only way I got to know him,

639
00:55:00,496 --> 00:55:04,567
really got to know him,
was when I went dark.

640
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,305
When I...
When I drank to dull the...

641
00:55:09,138 --> 00:55:11,407
or, uh...

642
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,743
whenever I wanted
to break someone's face,

643
00:55:13,776 --> 00:55:18,648
'cause the drinking
and the temper and the anger,

644
00:55:18,681 --> 00:55:20,450
those things in me were his.

645
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,485
And they were
all I could know of him.

646
00:55:25,154 --> 00:55:30,827
But now, well, now I get to
know him a little different...

647
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:34,497
'cause he also stood
in a room like this once...

648
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:38,968
wanting to get well
for me and my mom.

649
00:55:40,736 --> 00:55:43,072
And he held the chip
in his hand

650
00:55:43,105 --> 00:55:45,541
and the chip said five months,

651
00:55:45,574 --> 00:55:48,044
and on that day, he...

652
00:55:48,077 --> 00:55:49,813
Before it all...

653
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:53,983
Well, on that day,
all he wanted in the world

654
00:55:54,016 --> 00:55:56,353
was to stand
where I'm standing now.

655
00:55:57,586 --> 00:55:59,489
And here I am,

656
00:56:00,923 --> 00:56:03,660
so thank you for us both,
I guess.

657
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:06,796
This is for Jack Torrance.

658
00:56:25,981 --> 00:56:27,484
Hey, Charlie.

659
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:31,054
Doc?

660
00:56:34,123 --> 00:56:39,462
Guess I don't need to ask
why you're here at this hour.

661
00:56:41,897 --> 00:56:43,866
Do you have pain?

662
00:56:43,899 --> 00:56:46,669
Do you want me to get Claudette
to bring you a pill?

663
00:56:47,803 --> 00:56:50,773
Pill won't matter.

664
00:56:50,806 --> 00:56:55,478
I heard about
these house calls.

665
00:56:55,511 --> 00:57:00,450
What a visit from Doctor Sleep
really is.

666
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:05,155
So, what do you see, Doc?

667
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:15,498
I see your twin sons.

668
00:57:15,531 --> 00:57:16,833
Four years old.

669
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:18,935
Can you see them?

670
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:21,037
I do.

671
00:57:22,671 --> 00:57:24,807
Farmall tractor.

672
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,010
A striped umbrella
over the seat.

673
00:57:28,043 --> 00:57:29,712
Five years old,

674
00:57:30,646 --> 00:57:32,515
pulling a red wagon.

675
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:38,488
Lord, look at that.

676
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:40,723
Like a deck of cards.

677
00:57:40,756 --> 00:57:42,492
All out of order.

678
00:57:44,059 --> 00:57:47,964
I'm not scared of hell, Doc.

679
00:57:49,598 --> 00:57:54,804
Uh, I lived a decent life.

680
00:57:54,837 --> 00:57:58,040
I don't think
there is such a place anyway.

681
00:57:58,073 --> 00:57:59,809
I guess I'm scared...

682
00:58:01,677 --> 00:58:03,246
there's nothing.

683
00:58:05,214 --> 00:58:07,250
There was nothing before.

684
00:58:09,318 --> 00:58:14,591
So, what if there's
nothing after?

685
00:58:16,258 --> 00:58:18,194
We don't end, Charlie.

686
00:58:19,228 --> 00:58:21,564
I know that for certain.

687
00:58:21,597 --> 00:58:23,533
I don't know much else...

688
00:58:24,733 --> 00:58:27,070
but I know that we don't end.

689
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,142
Blueberries.

690
00:58:33,175 --> 00:58:37,714
I can taste blueberries
my mother used to grow.

691
00:58:39,014 --> 00:58:40,683
Can you taste them?

692
00:58:40,716 --> 00:58:44,654
- Yeah, I can.
- Ah.

693
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,657
And I can hear Frank
on your old radio.

694
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,025
The one you used to
have on your workbench

695
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:50,560
next to your tools.

696
00:58:52,027 --> 00:58:54,330

697

703
00:59:25,661 --> 00:59:27,730
Been a minute, little pen pal.

704
00:59:41,343 --> 00:59:45,081
Abra? School.

705
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:48,351
Fine, I know.

706
01:00:06,702 --> 01:00:08,771
Hey, Gramps, you seen Rosie?

707
01:00:08,804 --> 01:00:10,740
Watchtower.

708
01:00:12,808 --> 01:00:14,810
You feelin' okay?

709
01:00:14,843 --> 01:00:16,912
Peachy keen.

710
01:00:35,097 --> 01:00:36,633
Hey.

711
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,802
Sorry to interrupt.

712
01:00:39,835 --> 01:00:41,904
Any luck?

713
01:00:41,937 --> 01:00:43,973
- Gettin' closer.
- Hmm.

714
01:00:44,006 --> 01:00:46,909
He's somewhere in Iowa,
I think.

715
01:00:46,942 --> 01:00:50,680
We'll all take a nice long road
trip once I'm sure I've found him.

716
01:00:53,482 --> 01:00:55,751
Until I do, we...

717
01:00:55,784 --> 01:00:58,320
You gotta open a canister,
Rosie.

718
01:00:58,353 --> 01:01:02,324
We took steam six months ago,
Crow. Six months is nothing.

719
01:01:02,357 --> 01:01:06,429
That kid in Delaware wasn't so
steamy and it's already showing.

720
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:08,230
You see Grampa Flick's hair,
yeah?

721
01:01:08,263 --> 01:01:09,699
Yeah.

722
01:01:09,732 --> 01:01:11,267
I don't think he's well.

723
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,003
Grampa Flick hasn't been well
since Nixon was in office.

724
01:01:14,036 --> 01:01:16,272
I know.

725
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:19,208
But we need to eat.
All of us.

726
01:01:20,776 --> 01:01:22,712
Are the canisters low?

727
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:24,280
'Course not.

728
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:27,383
Just no need to waste one
if you're close to the kill.

729
01:01:29,184 --> 01:01:30,753
- Rosie.
- Mm-hmm?

730
01:01:30,786 --> 01:01:33,222
I might need it
just to find him.

731
01:01:37,025 --> 01:01:38,794
There used to be more steam
in the world, you know?

732
01:01:38,827 --> 01:01:40,329
Oh, don't be daft. Come on.

733
01:01:40,362 --> 01:01:42,064
That's like when rubes say,

734
01:01:42,097 --> 01:01:44,400
"50 years ago, people used
to be more neighborly."

735
01:01:44,433 --> 01:01:46,135
But it's true, Rosie.

736
01:01:46,168 --> 01:01:48,270
There's less steam out there,
and it's weaker, too.

737
01:01:48,303 --> 01:01:50,072
I don't know if
it's their cell phones or diets

738
01:01:50,105 --> 01:01:51,774
or their Netflix or what,

739
01:01:51,807 --> 01:01:53,876
but I am not picking up
many scents these days,

740
01:01:53,909 --> 01:01:55,411
and the ones that I do, Rosie,
are just not that...

741
01:01:55,444 --> 01:01:57,847
I'll open a canister tonight
to tide everyone over.

742
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,115
Thank you.

743
01:02:05,387 --> 01:02:07,857
- You know it, Rosie.
- I know what?

744
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,892
It's why you're up here
every day.

745
01:02:09,925 --> 01:02:11,828
It's why you're always up here no
matter what you tell the others.

746
01:02:12,928 --> 01:02:14,230
The world's not as steamy

747
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:16,365
and you are looking
for a whale.

748
01:03:05,113 --> 01:03:07,550
Oh, watch this kid.
Number 19.

749
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:09,451
That kid is a natural.

750
01:03:09,484 --> 01:03:11,420
He hits the ball every time.

751
01:03:11,453 --> 01:03:13,823
Like he can read
the pitcher's mind.

752
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:15,792
Hmm. Is that right?

753
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:26,535
See? You watch, one of these
days, one of those talent scouts

754
01:03:26,568 --> 01:03:29,839
is gonna get wind of Brad there.
You watch.

755
01:03:51,426 --> 01:03:54,129
Hey, 19,

756
01:03:54,162 --> 01:03:56,365
just saw your game.

757
01:03:56,398 --> 01:03:58,400
You are ready for the majors.

758
01:03:58,433 --> 01:04:00,336
- Well played.
- Thanks.

759
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:02,137
Hey, you headin' home?

760
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:05,407
You wanna hop in?
I'll give you a ride.

761
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,543
No, it's real close.

762
01:04:07,576 --> 01:04:08,544
I'm good.

763
01:04:11,313 --> 01:04:13,182
It's okay.

764
01:04:13,215 --> 01:04:16,052
We're friends. You wanna hop in.
We'll take you right home.

765
01:04:17,286 --> 01:04:19,021
You can take me right home.

766
01:04:20,088 --> 01:04:21,524
You trust me.

767
01:04:22,324 --> 01:04:23,626
I trust you.

768
01:04:58,627 --> 01:05:00,963
No! No, please! No!

769
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:14,643
No! Please let me go.

770
01:05:14,676 --> 01:05:18,147
Please, I won't tell. Please.
Please!

771
01:05:19,681 --> 01:05:23,953
Number 19.

772
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:25,454
Kid, you were good.

773
01:05:25,487 --> 01:05:27,456
No!

774
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:34,530
No, please let me go.

775
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:37,666
- - I won't tell.
I won't tell. Please.

776
01:05:37,699 --> 01:05:39,101
It's okay.

777
01:05:39,134 --> 01:05:40,303
Please.

778
01:05:43,638 --> 01:05:45,007
Ah.

779
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:50,479
Are you gonna hurt me?

780
01:05:51,146 --> 01:05:52,214
Yes.

781
01:05:52,247 --> 01:05:54,016
No!

782
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:57,753
Pain purifies steam.

783
01:05:57,786 --> 01:06:01,257
Fear, too, so, you understand.

784
01:06:23,311 --> 01:06:25,681
Shh.

785
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:50,072
Stop!

786
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:02,218
Stop.

787
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:04,720
Stop.

788
01:07:04,753 --> 01:07:07,023
Stop!

789
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:09,625
Stop, monster.

790
01:07:16,531 --> 01:07:18,401
Stop. Stop.

791
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:20,703
What is it?

792
01:07:30,745 --> 01:07:32,815
No! Stop!

793
01:07:38,653 --> 01:07:40,722
- Abra! Abra!
- Hey, hey, hey!

794
01:07:40,755 --> 01:07:42,691
Sweetie. Sweetheart, wake up.
Wake up, sweetheart.

795
01:07:42,724 --> 01:07:43,859
- Abra, wake up!
- Hey, hey, hey.

796
01:07:43,892 --> 01:07:45,194
- Abra! Abra!
- Stop it!

797
01:07:54,569 --> 01:07:55,771
Jesus.

798
01:08:40,715 --> 01:08:42,118
Okay.

799
01:08:42,851 --> 01:08:44,453
Okay.

800
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:46,822
Okay.

801
01:09:34,869 --> 01:09:37,673
Damn. I thought he had another
few minutes in him.

802
01:09:41,676 --> 01:09:43,579
Okay, ready?

803
01:09:56,791 --> 01:09:59,394
They killed him.

804
01:09:59,427 --> 01:10:01,697
They killed him.

805
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:07,503
It's okay.

806
01:10:34,529 --> 01:10:35,864
We had a looker.

807
01:10:40,702 --> 01:10:41,970
Tonight?

808
01:10:42,003 --> 01:10:43,538
Mm-hmm.

809
01:10:43,571 --> 01:10:44,740
Yeah.

810
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:47,709
Big steam?

811
01:10:47,742 --> 01:10:49,778
Oh, honey, it was huge.

812
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:52,681
Where?

813
01:10:52,714 --> 01:10:55,651
East Coast, I think.

814
01:10:57,719 --> 01:11:01,824
You're saying someone looked in
from 1,500 miles away?

815
01:11:03,358 --> 01:11:04,827
Maybe further.

816
01:11:06,761 --> 01:11:08,297
Boy or girl?

817
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:10,032
Girl, I think.

818
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:13,435
She was out of there so fast.

819
01:11:13,468 --> 01:11:16,338
But I swear, Crow Daddy,

820
01:11:16,371 --> 01:11:19,875
I haven't felt power like that,

821
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:22,444
raw power like that

822
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:26,014
in so long.

823
01:11:26,047 --> 01:11:28,317
Then we need to look into it.

824
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:30,419
- Sooner the better.
- Yeah.

825
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,020
Case her parents
freak out,

826
01:11:32,053 --> 01:11:34,589
send her to a psychiatrist.

827
01:11:34,622 --> 01:11:37,759
You know, they get her on
pills, could ruin the steam.

828
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:38,894
Might muffle her just...

829
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:40,762
No, giving Paxil to this kid,

830
01:11:40,795 --> 01:11:44,433
it's like throwing a piece of
Saran Wrap over a searchlight.

831
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:46,468
I don't know where she is,

832
01:11:46,501 --> 01:11:49,071
but when she comes back,
and she'll be back,

833
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:52,675
oh, I'll be ready, honey.

834
01:11:55,076 --> 01:11:56,745
I'll be ready.

835
01:12:57,705 --> 01:12:59,441
Morning.

836
01:12:59,474 --> 01:13:00,576
Morning.

837
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:03,445
Guess what.

838
01:13:03,478 --> 01:13:05,447
I made a new friend.

839
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,115
His name's Dan.

840
01:13:07,148 --> 01:13:09,084
Yeah? At school?

841
01:13:10,051 --> 01:13:12,154
No. He doesn't live here.

842
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:14,055
I mean, he lives close.

843
01:13:14,088 --> 01:13:15,524
Frazier, I think.

844
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:16,958
No big deal.

845
01:13:16,991 --> 01:13:19,094
Abs, are you okay?

846
01:13:19,127 --> 01:13:20,562
Last night, I...

847
01:13:20,595 --> 01:13:22,597
I'm okay.

848
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:24,132
Sorry about that.

849
01:13:24,165 --> 01:13:27,436
I know that head of yours
is like a radio sometimes.

850
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:31,473
And you pick up
some weird stations.

851
01:13:31,506 --> 01:13:32,541
Nothing weird like that.

852
01:13:33,608 --> 01:13:35,010
Not anymore.

853
01:13:44,519 --> 01:13:45,987
My God.

854
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:48,590
I've gotta study.
If I don't study...

855
01:13:48,623 --> 01:13:52,127
Running play.
Hand-off to 11 and...

856
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,163
Coach is gonna kill me
if I don't get these.

857
01:13:55,663 --> 01:13:57,666
Why doesn't he like me?

858
01:13:57,699 --> 01:13:59,601
My hair?
I should change my hair.

859
01:13:59,634 --> 01:14:01,169
The freak
is staring at me again.

860
01:14:01,202 --> 01:14:03,038
What is she staring at?

861
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:04,006
Freak.

862
01:14:43,845 --> 01:14:45,013
Hey, Abba-doo.

863
01:14:45,046 --> 01:14:46,214
Hey, Dad.

864
01:14:46,247 --> 01:14:47,850
School okay?

865
01:14:48,783 --> 01:14:50,185
How's the book?

866
01:14:50,218 --> 01:14:52,153
Good. Yeah, going good.

867
01:14:52,186 --> 01:14:54,222
I'm writing about
Charleston and Black Bottom.

868
01:14:54,255 --> 01:14:56,124
Yeah, it's...

869
01:14:56,157 --> 01:14:58,793
- It's feeling like...
- I'm going to start my homework.

870
01:14:58,826 --> 01:15:02,564
Okay. Good.
That's good, sweetie.

871
01:15:02,597 --> 01:15:04,699
Think Harvard in three years.

872
01:15:04,732 --> 01:15:05,934
We'll see.

873
01:15:05,967 --> 01:15:07,769
Yeah. We will see.

874
01:18:08,282 --> 01:18:09,751
Thanks so much

875
01:18:09,784 --> 01:18:11,386
for shopping with us today.

876
01:18:11,419 --> 01:18:14,089
And remember, we're always
fresh, just for you.

877
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:45,754
Well, hi there.

878
01:18:52,827 --> 01:18:54,196
Get out!

879
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:58,133
Get out! Get out of my head!

880
01:19:00,034 --> 01:19:01,136
Get out!

881
01:19:10,578 --> 01:19:13,348
- Ma'am, are you okay?
- No! No.

882
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:15,117
Yeah, I'm fine.

883
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:17,819
I'm fine.

884
01:19:24,492 --> 01:19:26,194
Jesus.

885
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:29,063
Danno?

886
01:19:29,096 --> 01:19:30,398
Dan? Dan?

887
01:19:30,431 --> 01:19:32,901
Get up. Stand up, Dan.

888
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:34,136
Come on, Danno.

889
01:19:35,837 --> 01:19:38,106
- What happened?
- Well, you just dropped.

890
01:19:38,139 --> 01:19:40,876
Thought you was having a stroke.
Who's Tony?

891
01:19:42,343 --> 01:19:43,912
What?

892
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:45,013
You kept saying,
"Please help me, Tony."

893
01:19:46,347 --> 01:19:48,449
Oh.

894
01:19:48,482 --> 01:19:51,286
Well, I'm sorry about that.

895
01:20:10,471 --> 01:20:12,440
Rosie?

896
01:20:24,018 --> 01:20:25,186
We've got a problem.

897
01:20:25,219 --> 01:20:27,422
- Talk to me.
- The looker?

898
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:29,557
Yeah, she found me again.

899
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:31,092
- How?
- I don't know.

900
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:32,493
I don't care.

901
01:20:32,526 --> 01:20:36,097
We have to have her, Crow.
We have to.

902
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:38,266
Does she know who you are?
Where we are?

903
01:20:38,299 --> 01:20:42,437
No, I don't know. I don't think...
That's not the important... Look.

904
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:45,006
- I said she's huge steam, right?
- Mm-hmm.

905
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:47,308
Yeah, it's even bigger
than that.

906
01:20:47,341 --> 01:20:49,010
I tried to turn around in her

907
01:20:49,043 --> 01:20:52,113
and she blew me out of her
like I was nothing.

908
01:20:52,146 --> 01:20:55,016
- Bullshit.
- No. Never happened to me, ever.

909
01:20:55,049 --> 01:20:56,852
I would have said
that was impossible.

910
01:20:58,619 --> 01:21:00,622
Is she food
or do we turn her?

911
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:03,291
We don't turn her.

912
01:21:03,324 --> 01:21:04,893
Rosie, are you sure?

913
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:06,394
If she's what you say she is,
then...

914
01:21:06,427 --> 01:21:09,430
Then we don't want anyone
with that power in the Knot.

915
01:21:09,463 --> 01:21:11,433
Jeez. Think about it.

916
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:19,975
What if she's neither?

917
01:21:20,641 --> 01:21:21,943
What do you mean?

918
01:21:21,976 --> 01:21:24,445
I mean, we don't kill her.

919
01:21:24,478 --> 01:21:26,248
And we don't turn her.

920
01:21:27,615 --> 01:21:29,284
Think of a cow.

921
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:32,020
You butcher one, that gives you
meat for a month.

922
01:21:33,387 --> 01:21:35,190
Keep it alive,

923
01:21:36,123 --> 01:21:38,326
take care of it,

924
01:21:38,359 --> 01:21:41,195
it gives you milk for years.

925
01:21:41,228 --> 01:21:43,298
- Rosie, we've never tried that.
- I know.

926
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:45,300
Because a steam head is
dangerous.

927
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:47,001
You keep it alive,
it could be dangerous.

928
01:21:47,034 --> 01:21:49,570
I know. The point...

929
01:21:49,603 --> 01:21:52,173
The point, Crow,

930
01:21:52,206 --> 01:21:54,376
is she's the great white whale.

931
01:21:55,376 --> 01:21:56,978
And I want her.

932
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:00,248
I want her.

933
01:22:01,649 --> 01:22:03,652
I fucking want her.

934
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:16,097
Have a great day.

935
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:17,299
You, too.

936
01:23:44,518 --> 01:23:46,221
Hi.

937
01:23:56,397 --> 01:23:57,665
Billy.

938
01:24:15,883 --> 01:24:17,652
You can hear me.

939
01:24:17,685 --> 01:24:20,221
Let's use our outside voices,
all right?

940
01:24:21,455 --> 01:24:23,224
You tracked me down?

941
01:24:23,257 --> 01:24:27,829
It was easier than I thought.
Like GPS, but in my head.

942
01:24:27,862 --> 01:24:33,134
Look, I don't mean any offense,
but this day and age, a grown man

943
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:35,103
sitting with a teenage girl
on a park bench...

944
01:24:35,136 --> 01:24:37,805
I'm Abra Stone. And if anyone
asks, you're my uncle.

945
01:24:37,838 --> 01:24:39,374
Uncle Dan.

946
01:24:41,842 --> 01:24:45,313
And that's not even a lie.
Not totally.

947
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:47,448
We're related in other ways.

948
01:24:47,481 --> 01:24:49,317
You're magic, like me.

949
01:24:50,851 --> 01:24:52,720
I don't know about magic.

950
01:24:53,754 --> 01:24:55,323
I...

951
01:24:55,356 --> 01:24:56,858
I always called it the shining.

952
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:58,760
And, yeah, we both shine.

953
01:24:59,827 --> 01:25:01,395
Do your parents know?

954
01:25:01,428 --> 01:25:03,131
About my shine?

955
01:25:04,598 --> 01:25:05,900
They're scared of it,

956
01:25:05,933 --> 01:25:08,503
but they think it's gone
except for a few things.

957
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:11,906
Like, my mom sometimes asks me to
help her find something she's lost.

958
01:25:11,939 --> 01:25:13,808
Last month,
it was her car keys.

959
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:16,644
She left them on my dad's
worktable in the garage.

960
01:25:16,677 --> 01:25:19,413
But they don't talk about it.

961
01:25:19,446 --> 01:25:22,583
Or if I use it,
they look at me different.

962
01:25:22,616 --> 01:25:24,318
Or not at all.

963
01:25:24,351 --> 01:25:26,787
Not for a whole day once.

964
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:28,690
Wouldn't look me in the eyes.

965
01:25:30,858 --> 01:25:33,161
So, I try not to use it.

966
01:25:33,194 --> 01:25:35,296
Because if people find out,

967
01:25:35,329 --> 01:25:36,764
"Eek, a freak." You know?

968
01:25:38,699 --> 01:25:40,468
Sure you know.

969
01:25:40,501 --> 01:25:42,437
You try not to use it, too.

970
01:25:44,538 --> 01:25:47,542
You've been trying a long time,

971
01:25:47,575 --> 01:25:50,812
and she couldn't look you
in your eyes either.

972
01:25:54,949 --> 01:25:56,551
When I was a kid, I didn't

973
01:25:56,584 --> 01:25:59,420
understand the shining.
I called it "Tony."

974
01:25:59,453 --> 01:26:01,756
I thought he was
my imaginary friend.

975
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:04,825
I thought you were
my imaginary friend...

976
01:26:04,858 --> 01:26:06,928
for a long time.

977
01:26:08,295 --> 01:26:11,732
How many of us are out there?

978
01:26:11,765 --> 01:26:13,734
There's a lot of people
who have a little bit of shine,

979
01:26:13,767 --> 01:26:15,369
they don't even know it.

980
01:26:15,402 --> 01:26:16,704
They always seem to come home

981
01:26:16,737 --> 01:26:18,539
with flowers
when their wives are sad,

982
01:26:18,572 --> 01:26:20,841
or they do well on the school
test they didn't study for.

983
01:26:20,874 --> 01:26:22,710
But I only met
two or three people

984
01:26:22,743 --> 01:26:24,946
in my whole life
who knew they shined.

985
01:26:27,548 --> 01:26:29,650
The baseball boy shined.

986
01:26:29,683 --> 01:26:31,586
His name was Bradley Trevor.

987
01:26:34,755 --> 01:26:36,891
These people...

988
01:26:36,924 --> 01:26:39,727
they look like people anyway,
they took him.

989
01:26:40,794 --> 01:26:42,797
And they ate him.

990
01:26:43,931 --> 01:26:45,800
They ate his shine.

991
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:49,270
You could feel it?

992
01:26:49,303 --> 01:26:51,706
And they could feel me,
I think.

993
01:26:51,739 --> 01:26:54,275
At least one of them did.
A lady.

994
01:26:55,709 --> 01:26:57,378
The lady with the hat.

995
01:26:58,712 --> 01:27:01,882
I wanna find them, stop them,

996
01:27:01,915 --> 01:27:05,920
because I think they've done
this to a lot of other kids, too.

997
01:27:05,953 --> 01:27:08,389
So, I have to do something,
right?

998
01:27:09,356 --> 01:27:11,525
Why did you come here?

999
01:27:11,558 --> 01:27:12,960
Why me?

1000
01:27:12,993 --> 01:27:14,695
Because you can hear me.

1001
01:27:14,728 --> 01:27:17,465
You'd believe me.
You shine, too.

1002
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:19,300
And they hurt people like us.

1003
01:27:21,535 --> 01:27:22,971
I mean, what would you do?

1004
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,642
If you could get
something of his,

1005
01:27:27,675 --> 01:27:28,976
if you could go to Iowa...

1006
01:27:29,009 --> 01:27:30,778
- Whoa, hang on.
- I can help you find him.

1007
01:27:30,811 --> 01:27:32,613
Then his parents would know
where he was.

1008
01:27:32,646 --> 01:27:34,615
They could bury him right,
at least.

1009
01:27:34,648 --> 01:27:36,751
We could also get his glove.

1010
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:38,519
If I can touch that glove,
I can track them.

1011
01:27:38,552 --> 01:27:39,954
Easy. Easy.

1012
01:27:39,987 --> 01:27:42,623
Because Barry the Chunk,
I think that was his name,

1013
01:27:42,656 --> 01:27:44,792
for a while,
before they killed him,

1014
01:27:44,825 --> 01:27:46,594
he was wearing it.

1015
01:27:58,038 --> 01:28:00,841
Abra, go home.

1016
01:28:00,874 --> 01:28:03,778
Think about your school.
Think about your parents.

1017
01:28:03,811 --> 01:28:05,780
Think about
the rest of your life.

1018
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:07,882
Don't chase these people.

1019
01:28:07,915 --> 01:28:09,817
Don't aggravate them.

1020
01:28:09,850 --> 01:28:12,887
And whatever you do,
don't attract their attention.

1021
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,722
Don't shine.

1022
01:28:14,755 --> 01:28:16,457
Find something, anything...

1023
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:20,394
Well, almost anything,
to stop that shine of yours.

1024
01:28:20,427 --> 01:28:23,064
Keep your head down, keep your
shine down and hope to God

1025
01:28:23,097 --> 01:28:25,733
that these people
or anything like them,

1026
01:28:25,766 --> 01:28:28,669
that they don't see you.

1027
01:28:28,702 --> 01:28:31,372
If they see you,
they come back.

1028
01:28:31,405 --> 01:28:32,907
Abra, do you hear me?

1029
01:28:34,007 --> 01:28:35,710
They come back.

1030
01:28:38,545 --> 01:28:40,615
Keep your head down. Stay safe.

1031
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:43,985
I'm sorry.

1032
01:28:56,964 --> 01:28:58,699
Things were tough that year.

1033
01:28:58,732 --> 01:29:00,535
A lot of actors
were out of work.

1034
01:29:02,736 --> 01:29:04,572
Hey, fellas.

1035
01:29:04,605 --> 01:29:05,373
Here comes Elmer Fudd
that big vaudeville star.

1036
01:29:05,406 --> 01:29:06,907
What is it?

1037
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:08,609
Oh, it's nothing, Doc.

1038
01:29:09,443 --> 01:29:11,112
It's nothing.

1039
01:29:11,145 --> 01:29:12,814
Thinking about Dad.

1040
01:29:16,083 --> 01:29:17,385
No, I'm not.

1041
01:29:18,652 --> 01:29:20,655
You are. And you don't want to.

1042
01:29:25,759 --> 01:29:27,595
Don't worry about me, Doc.

1043
01:29:28,095 --> 01:29:29,030
I'm fine.

1044
01:29:31,965 --> 01:29:33,367
We're fine.

1045
01:30:11,004 --> 01:30:12,874
Hey, Azzie.

1046
01:30:25,586 --> 01:30:27,855
You got your wires crossed
tonight.

1047
01:30:30,524 --> 01:30:32,059
That room's empty, Az.

1048
01:30:36,797 --> 01:30:39,000
There's no one in that room.

1049
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,677
Whoa! Hang on, Doc.

1050
01:30:50,577 --> 01:30:51,546
Dick.

1051
01:30:52,746 --> 01:30:54,648
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1052
01:30:54,681 --> 01:30:55,950
I... I... I thought it was...

1053
01:30:55,983 --> 01:30:57,885
Thought I was
from the Overlook.

1054
01:30:57,918 --> 01:31:00,054
Almost locked me up.

1055
01:31:00,087 --> 01:31:02,756
Still getting visits
from them old ghosts?

1056
01:31:02,789 --> 01:31:04,625
No, not for years.

1057
01:31:04,658 --> 01:31:07,928
Horace Derwent was the last
one, confetti on his suit.

1058
01:31:07,961 --> 01:31:09,964
Said, "Great party, isn't it?"

1059
01:31:09,997 --> 01:31:13,267
Shit-eating grin on his face
till I pulled out a box for him.

1060
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:16,070
That grin went fast.

1061
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:18,839
Hey, it never occurred to me
to ask you back then.

1062
01:31:18,872 --> 01:31:20,674
What happens to them
in those boxes?

1063
01:31:20,707 --> 01:31:22,042
Do they die in there?

1064
01:31:22,075 --> 01:31:23,478
Do you care?

1065
01:31:27,714 --> 01:31:28,916
I missed you.

1066
01:31:28,949 --> 01:31:30,117
Has it been a long time?

1067
01:31:31,685 --> 01:31:33,921
Can't tell.

1068
01:31:33,954 --> 01:31:37,925
This world is a dream
of a dream to me now.

1069
01:31:37,958 --> 01:31:40,661
Eight years. Little more.

1070
01:31:40,694 --> 01:31:42,730
Last time I saw you,

1071
01:31:42,763 --> 01:31:44,632
you was at the bottom.

1072
01:31:45,866 --> 01:31:47,768
You look better now.

1073
01:31:47,801 --> 01:31:49,937
Why are you here?

1074
01:31:49,970 --> 01:31:52,640
I'm here because
it all comes 'round.

1075
01:31:53,607 --> 01:31:55,243
Ka's a wheel, Doc.

1076
01:31:57,578 --> 01:31:58,946
You listen, son.

1077
01:31:58,979 --> 01:32:02,049
It hurts to be here,
so I'll only say it once.

1078
01:32:02,082 --> 01:32:05,553
These empty devils
ever found you

1079
01:32:05,586 --> 01:32:07,187
when you was a tyke,

1080
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:09,690
if they'd even sniffed you,

1081
01:32:09,723 --> 01:32:11,659
you'd be long dead.

1082
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:16,630
They're on the land
like a cancer on the skin.

1083
01:32:16,663 --> 01:32:19,199
Once, they rode camels
in the desert.

1084
01:32:19,232 --> 01:32:22,837
Once, they drove caravans
across Eastern Europe.

1085
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:26,006
They eat screams,

1086
01:32:26,039 --> 01:32:28,642
and drink pain,

1087
01:32:28,675 --> 01:32:31,312
and they've noticed
that little girl.

1088
01:32:32,646 --> 01:32:33,981
They might kill her,

1089
01:32:35,682 --> 01:32:36,918
might turn her,

1090
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:41,689
or might keep her
till she's all used up,

1091
01:32:41,722 --> 01:32:43,123
and that'd be worst of all.

1092
01:32:43,156 --> 01:32:44,992
You can't let 'em.

1093
01:32:47,661 --> 01:32:49,330
Why me?

1094
01:32:49,363 --> 01:32:51,765
Because she found you.

1095
01:32:51,798 --> 01:32:55,302
Because she showed up.
Hell, Doc, why me?

1096
01:32:55,335 --> 01:32:57,838
You just walked on
into my kitchen one day,

1097
01:32:57,871 --> 01:32:59,206
and I'm still on the hook.

1098
01:32:59,239 --> 01:33:01,075
What the hell
am I supposed to do?

1099
01:33:03,310 --> 01:33:05,780
Get her what she asked for.

1100
01:33:08,015 --> 01:33:10,117
You won't see me again, Doc.

1101
01:33:11,118 --> 01:33:13,087
This is my last dream.

1102
01:33:19,326 --> 01:33:23,163
It seems to me
you grew up fine, son,

1103
01:33:23,196 --> 01:33:24,966
but you still owe a debt.

1104
01:33:30,070 --> 01:33:31,272
Pay it.

1105
01:33:45,252 --> 01:33:47,154
God, damn it. What?

1106
01:33:50,157 --> 01:33:52,026
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

1107
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:54,895
I told you, "no distractions."
Didn't I?

1108
01:33:54,928 --> 01:33:56,864
Nothing to eat,
nothing to drink.

1109
01:33:56,897 --> 01:34:00,100
Just peace, quiet,
and meditation.

1110
01:34:00,133 --> 01:34:03,937
I need all my wits
for her tonight, Crow.

1111
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:06,340
That's why I'm here.
I found something.

1112
01:34:13,346 --> 01:34:17,251
"How small
can an earthquake be?"

1113
01:34:17,284 --> 01:34:19,987
Pretty small, if the people
of Richland Court,

1114
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:24,725
a short Anniston street that dead-ends
at the Saco River, are to be believed.

1115
01:34:24,758 --> 01:34:26,193
Late Tuesday night,

1116
01:34:26,226 --> 01:34:28,162
several residents of the street
reported a tremor

1117
01:34:28,195 --> 01:34:30,064
that rattled windows,
shook floors,

1118
01:34:30,097 --> 01:34:33,834
and sent glassware tumbling
from the shelves.

1119
01:34:33,867 --> 01:34:37,838
Although the Geological Survey
Center in Wrentham

1120
01:34:37,871 --> 01:34:40,941
"reports there were no temblors
in New England last Tuesday."

1121
01:34:42,008 --> 01:34:43,243
What do you think?

1122
01:34:43,276 --> 01:34:45,245
I think, maybe.

1123
01:34:45,278 --> 01:34:49,450
I'm not a hundred percent,
but I'll take fifty-fifty.

1124
01:34:49,483 --> 01:34:50,784
If that's actually her...

1125
01:34:50,817 --> 01:34:52,319
Richland Court.

1126
01:34:52,352 --> 01:34:54,388
She did that, shook a whole
street in New Hampshire...

1127
01:34:54,421 --> 01:34:57,191
Having a place to actually focus
on, not just a town, but a street,

1128
01:34:57,224 --> 01:35:00,227
is gonna make things a hell of
a lot easier for me tonight.

1129
01:35:01,194 --> 01:35:02,396
Good catch.

1130
01:35:08,969 --> 01:35:10,337
How you coming at her?

1131
01:35:12,439 --> 01:35:14,008
Well, she'll be asleep.

1132
01:35:15,442 --> 01:35:19,379
I'll just wanna look around,
see if she is.

1133
01:35:19,412 --> 01:35:22,817
Plant some suggestions,
like little worms.

1134
01:35:23,917 --> 01:35:26,453
Let them burrow.

1135
01:35:26,486 --> 01:35:30,191
A hundred worms about
her dear friends, the Knot.

1136
01:35:31,525 --> 01:35:33,961
And when we roll up,

1137
01:35:33,994 --> 01:35:37,998
she'll be so happy to see us,
she'll just hop right in the van.

1138
01:35:42,269 --> 01:35:44,505
- If she did this...
- Mm-hmm?

1139
01:35:44,538 --> 01:35:47,207
...really shook a whole street,

1140
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,510
I think you should be careful.

1141
01:35:49,543 --> 01:35:51,245
She's a little girl.

1142
01:35:56,950 --> 01:35:59,319
And you are the queen bitch
of all time.

1143
01:35:59,352 --> 01:36:01,221
- Mm.
- I know.

1144
01:36:01,254 --> 01:36:03,457
Just saying.

1145
01:36:03,490 --> 01:36:05,826
- Be careful.
- Mm.

1146
01:36:23,476 --> 01:36:25,045
Mm.

1147
01:36:30,317 --> 01:36:31,251
Hey.

1148
01:36:31,284 --> 01:36:32,252
Hey, Mom.

1149
01:36:32,285 --> 01:36:33,487
You feeling okay?

1150
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,022
We missed you at dinner.

1151
01:36:35,956 --> 01:36:38,559
I'm okay. Just had a rough day.

1152
01:36:43,363 --> 01:36:46,133
I'm flying out to see Momo
in the morning.

1153
01:36:46,166 --> 01:36:47,568
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1154
01:36:50,003 --> 01:36:51,238
Abs, is she...

1155
01:36:55,275 --> 01:36:56,911
Is she gonna
pull through this time?

1156
01:37:01,448 --> 01:37:02,449
I don't know.

1157
01:37:04,117 --> 01:37:05,219
I hope so.

1158
01:37:06,353 --> 01:37:07,822
Tell her I love her.

1159
01:39:51,051 --> 01:39:53,253
Keep sleeping, princess.

1160
01:40:07,067 --> 01:40:10,170
You rubes.

1161
01:40:10,203 --> 01:40:13,573
Spend your whole lives
making little boxes,

1162
01:40:13,606 --> 01:40:16,410
little memories.

1163
01:40:16,443 --> 01:40:19,513
Oh, you think
they make you so rich.

1164
01:40:19,546 --> 01:40:21,582
You should see mine, kiddo.

1165
01:40:22,782 --> 01:40:26,020
Oh, my mind's a cathedral.

1166
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:32,559
Well, hi there.

1167
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:41,268
Hmm.

1168
01:40:56,716 --> 01:40:58,052
He said you'd come back.

1169
01:40:59,819 --> 01:41:00,821
And you did.

1170
01:41:02,856 --> 01:41:04,291
Good.

1171
01:41:04,324 --> 01:41:06,560
No!

1172
01:41:06,593 --> 01:41:09,863
Get back! Get back!

1173
01:41:09,896 --> 01:41:12,666
You're just
a fucking child!

1174
01:41:18,138 --> 01:41:19,539
Where are you?

1175
01:41:19,572 --> 01:41:21,808
Where? Where did you...?
Where...?

1176
01:41:21,841 --> 01:41:23,777
What did you...?
Where did you...?

1177
01:41:25,512 --> 01:41:26,480
No.

1178
01:41:28,648 --> 01:41:30,450
Get out! Get out!

1179
01:41:30,483 --> 01:41:31,651
Get out!

1180
01:42:17,397 --> 01:42:18,465
Rose?

1181
01:42:18,498 --> 01:42:19,866
Trap.

1182
01:42:19,899 --> 01:42:21,535
Trap.

1183
01:42:21,568 --> 01:42:23,470
What the hell happened?

1184
01:42:23,503 --> 01:42:25,805
- Little bitch set a trap for me.
- Oh, my God. Your hand.

1185
01:42:25,838 --> 01:42:27,641
Rose! Rose, calm down.

1186
01:42:27,674 --> 01:42:29,876
We know where she is now, right?
Now we know.

1187
01:42:29,909 --> 01:42:31,411
She was in my head!

1188
01:42:31,444 --> 01:42:32,846
- What?
- Stealing!

1189
01:42:32,879 --> 01:42:33,947
What does she know?

1190
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:35,549
I don't know. I don't know.

1191
01:42:35,582 --> 01:42:37,851
- How much does she...
- I don't know!

1192
01:42:37,884 --> 01:42:40,420
- I don't know...
- There's a problem.

1193
01:42:40,453 --> 01:42:41,421
Not now!

1194
01:42:41,454 --> 01:42:42,523
Grampa Flick...

1195
01:42:43,556 --> 01:42:45,325
I think he's cycling.

1196
01:42:50,730 --> 01:42:53,600
Uncle Dan! Uncle Dan,
I hurt her.

1197
01:42:53,633 --> 01:42:54,634
I really hurt her.

1198
01:42:54,667 --> 01:42:56,403
I hurt her and she deserved it

1199
01:42:56,436 --> 01:42:58,505
and that's not the best part.
The best part is...

1200
01:42:58,538 --> 01:43:01,608
The best part is I got in her head.
I got in her head.

1201
01:43:01,641 --> 01:43:03,743
- Uncle Dan? Are you there?
- Oh, God, Abra.

1202
01:43:03,776 --> 01:43:04,945
Can you hear me?

1203
01:43:04,978 --> 01:43:06,380
What have you done?

1204
01:43:22,462 --> 01:43:24,998
Just talk to the kid.

1205
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:27,534
If we're gonna do this,
then let's do this.

1206
01:43:30,837 --> 01:43:31,939
Hi, Abra.

1207
01:43:35,908 --> 01:43:37,411
I can hear you.

1208
01:43:41,681 --> 01:43:43,650
I don't understand.

1209
01:43:43,683 --> 01:43:44,785
You will.

1210
01:43:46,653 --> 01:43:49,623
I thought we lived forever.

1211
01:43:49,656 --> 01:43:52,359
Did someone promise you that,
Andi?

1212
01:43:52,392 --> 01:43:54,695
Did someone say
you're immortal?

1213
01:43:55,862 --> 01:44:00,800
I said, "Live long, eat well."

1214
01:44:00,833 --> 01:44:02,802
We can live long, very long.

1215
01:44:02,835 --> 01:44:03,937
And we do,

1216
01:44:03,970 --> 01:44:05,739
most of us.

1217
01:44:05,772 --> 01:44:07,741
But we haven't been
eating well.

1218
01:44:08,975 --> 01:44:11,245
Not for a long time.

1219
01:44:12,078 --> 01:44:13,380
Rosie, he's going.

1220
01:44:15,014 --> 01:44:16,316
Rosie.

1221
01:44:22,088 --> 01:44:23,557
Yes, love?

1222
01:44:24,824 --> 01:44:26,593
I'm scared.

1223
01:44:26,626 --> 01:44:29,663
No, you're not.

1224
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:34,768
You watched empires rise and
fall.

1225
01:44:34,801 --> 01:44:37,570
Cheered the gladiators in Rome.

1226
01:44:37,603 --> 01:44:39,606
Sailed across oceans,

1227
01:44:39,639 --> 01:44:41,841
to new worlds,

1228
01:44:41,874 --> 01:44:47,981
while you fed on kings,
and princes, and popes.

1229
01:44:48,014 --> 01:44:50,684
They wrote myths of you,

1230
01:44:50,717 --> 01:44:53,019
and made statues,

1231
01:44:53,052 --> 01:44:57,857
and they trembled
in their villages, and beds,

1232
01:44:57,890 --> 01:45:00,060
and skyscrapers.

1233
01:45:01,661 --> 01:45:04,064
So, no...

1234
01:45:04,097 --> 01:45:06,733
...you're not scared.

1235
01:45:08,634 --> 01:45:10,037
You're a king...

1236
01:45:11,537 --> 01:45:13,740
and you eat fear.

1237
01:46:05,625 --> 01:46:06,993
Hey, bro.

1238
01:46:07,026 --> 01:46:08,161
You know, it's 4:00 a.m.

1239
01:46:08,194 --> 01:46:10,397
You've always seen me, Billy.

1240
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:12,999
You have a good sense about
people, is that fair to say?

1241
01:46:13,833 --> 01:46:15,135
Yeah, what...

1242
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:17,404
You think I'm an honest man?
A good man?

1243
01:46:17,437 --> 01:46:18,705
I do, I do. Dan, I...

1244
01:46:18,738 --> 01:46:20,507
I need your help.

1245
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:22,075
The first thing I need is for
you to listen to a story

1246
01:46:22,108 --> 01:46:24,811
and try harder than you've ever
tried to believe me.

1247
01:46:41,861 --> 01:46:42,996
How's it going?

1248
01:46:44,197 --> 01:46:45,665
Oh, hey.

1249
01:46:45,698 --> 01:46:46,933
Shouldn't you be
getting ready for school?

1250
01:46:46,966 --> 01:46:49,769
Yeah, but I wanted
to tag along.

1251
01:46:49,802 --> 01:46:51,037
How long have you been driving?

1252
01:46:51,070 --> 01:46:52,806
A few hours or so.

1253
01:46:52,839 --> 01:46:54,574
We should get there tonight.
Late.

1254
01:46:57,009 --> 01:46:58,745
Who's that?

1255
01:46:58,778 --> 01:47:00,113
He's my friend.

1256
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:02,716
Maybe my best friend.

1257
01:47:04,083 --> 01:47:06,052
You should've seen her face.

1258
01:47:06,085 --> 01:47:08,121
She was scared, Uncle Dan.

1259
01:47:08,154 --> 01:47:10,023
Scared like all those kids
were scared.

1260
01:47:10,056 --> 01:47:11,825
All those kids she's killed.

1261
01:47:11,858 --> 01:47:14,928
She was so mad
and so scared that I got in.

1262
01:47:14,961 --> 01:47:16,529
That was a new trick.

1263
01:47:16,562 --> 01:47:18,064
I've never done that before.

1264
01:47:18,097 --> 01:47:20,033
Yeah, me neither.
What was it like?

1265
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:22,469
Like a library.

1266
01:47:22,502 --> 01:47:24,738
I guess
we're all libraries inside.

1267
01:47:25,671 --> 01:47:27,106
How'd you do it?

1268
01:47:27,139 --> 01:47:29,509
Like this. Just a little push.

1269
01:47:34,714 --> 01:47:36,149
Abra!

1270
01:47:36,182 --> 01:47:38,018
Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry!

1271
01:47:42,955 --> 01:47:44,624
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
- It's okay.

1272
01:47:46,092 --> 01:47:48,027
What were all those boxes?

1273
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:49,162
Nothing.

1274
01:47:49,195 --> 01:47:50,564
Liar.

1275
01:47:53,666 --> 01:47:55,935
When I was a kid,

1276
01:47:55,968 --> 01:47:59,038
younger than you,
I bumped into something like these things

1277
01:47:59,071 --> 01:48:01,908
that ate like they do.

1278
01:48:01,941 --> 01:48:04,144
Only it wasn't a person,
it was a place.

1279
01:48:05,778 --> 01:48:10,583
They closed it down after
and let it rot.

1280
01:48:10,616 --> 01:48:12,819
But the things
that lived there, they...

1281
01:48:14,887 --> 01:48:16,923
Don't go poking around in there
again.

1282
01:48:16,956 --> 01:48:19,626
Okay, I won't. I promise.

1283
01:48:32,939 --> 01:48:35,208
We're almost ready.
We're just loading up.

1284
01:48:35,241 --> 01:48:36,676
Good.

1285
01:48:36,709 --> 01:48:37,977
Get the caravan on the road

1286
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:39,579
and we'll have her
in a day or two.

1287
01:48:39,612 --> 01:48:42,048
I don't think
you should come, Rosie.

1288
01:48:42,081 --> 01:48:45,018
The fuck
did you just say?

1289
01:48:45,051 --> 01:48:46,219
She tagged you.

1290
01:48:46,252 --> 01:48:47,720
She got in your head.

1291
01:48:47,753 --> 01:48:49,622
Yeah, it won't happen again.

1292
01:48:49,655 --> 01:48:51,558
And who knows how much she got
to before you kicked her out.

1293
01:48:51,591 --> 01:48:52,892
She's mine, Crow.

1294
01:48:52,925 --> 01:48:54,227
Right now, as far as we know,

1295
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:56,763
you are the only one of us
she could track.

1296
01:48:56,796 --> 01:48:58,798
Now, if she sees you coming,

1297
01:48:58,831 --> 01:49:00,099
she could run

1298
01:49:00,132 --> 01:49:02,068
or set another trap.

1299
01:49:03,669 --> 01:49:06,005
I will knock her out cold.

1300
01:49:06,038 --> 01:49:09,108
One of our assets from the NSA
gave me the good stuff.

1301
01:49:09,141 --> 01:49:12,312
Put her out without
chance of an overdose.

1302
01:49:12,345 --> 01:49:15,114
I'll head south.
I'll circle around.

1303
01:49:15,147 --> 01:49:17,050
I'll come at her
from a different direction.

1304
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:18,284
I should be there.

1305
01:49:18,317 --> 01:49:20,253
You know I'm right about this.

1306
01:49:24,724 --> 01:49:25,892
Okay.

1307
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:29,829
I'll leave Andi here with you,
if you want.

1308
01:49:29,862 --> 01:49:32,599
No, no, you'll need your
strength, all of you.

1309
01:49:32,632 --> 01:49:34,601
If she pulls a trick on you,

1310
01:49:34,634 --> 01:49:36,669
stay together.

1311
01:49:36,702 --> 01:49:37,637
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1312
01:49:37,670 --> 01:49:39,005
Mm-hmm.

1313
01:49:39,038 --> 01:49:41,107
But I got some tricks
of my own.

1314
01:49:47,046 --> 01:49:48,848
Hey,
I think we're here.

1315
01:49:51,283 --> 01:49:52,252
Okay.

1316
01:49:53,953 --> 01:49:55,589
I'll see if I can get her.

1317
01:49:56,822 --> 01:49:57,724
Abra?

1318
01:49:59,692 --> 01:50:02,395
That's the sign.
Pull around back.

1319
01:50:02,428 --> 01:50:03,997
She says to pull around back.

1320
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:05,131
And I'll tell you when to stop.

1321
01:50:05,164 --> 01:50:06,933
She'll tell us when to stop.

1322
01:50:13,272 --> 01:50:15,274
I gotta tell you,
Danno,

1323
01:50:15,307 --> 01:50:17,944
I don't know whether I hope
you're right or wrong about this.

1324
01:50:17,977 --> 01:50:21,648
I mean, if you're wrong,
my friend is crazy.

1325
01:50:21,681 --> 01:50:25,418
I mean, full-blown,
mental breakdown,

1326
01:50:25,451 --> 01:50:29,188
imaginary-monsters-
killing-imaginary-kids

1327
01:50:29,221 --> 01:50:30,923
bonkers.

1328
01:50:30,956 --> 01:50:33,326
But, you know, I...
I can work with that.

1329
01:50:34,694 --> 01:50:35,962
If you're right, though...

1330
01:50:35,995 --> 01:50:37,697
I know.

1331
01:50:37,730 --> 01:50:39,132
It's much worse.

1332
01:50:53,312 --> 01:50:54,881
You should go home.

1333
01:50:54,914 --> 01:50:56,716
What?

1334
01:50:56,749 --> 01:50:58,051
No, not you.

1335
01:50:59,118 --> 01:51:00,353
I can handle it.

1336
01:51:00,386 --> 01:51:03,056
No. We'll take it from here.

1337
01:51:06,125 --> 01:51:07,961
Okay, it's just us.

1338
01:51:24,944 --> 01:51:26,179
You smell that?

1339
01:51:29,148 --> 01:51:31,451
Used to hunt.
I ever tell you that?

1340
01:51:31,484 --> 01:51:32,885
No.

1341
01:51:32,918 --> 01:51:33,753
Deer.

1342
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:35,889
This one summer,

1343
01:51:37,022 --> 01:51:38,925
I clipped this buck.

1344
01:51:38,958 --> 01:51:41,294
I was tracking it for two days.

1345
01:51:41,327 --> 01:51:44,731
I got the shot, clipped him.

1346
01:51:44,764 --> 01:51:46,999
He ran off, I went after.

1347
01:51:47,032 --> 01:51:50,403
Figured he wasn't
gonna last long.

1348
01:51:52,271 --> 01:51:53,906
Then he vanished.

1349
01:51:53,939 --> 01:51:56,976
Just up and evaporated.

1350
01:51:57,009 --> 01:51:59,446
Not a trace. Truly baffling.

1351
01:52:02,414 --> 01:52:03,916
Five days later,

1352
01:52:03,949 --> 01:52:06,886
I'm trying a different spot,
miles away.

1353
01:52:06,919 --> 01:52:10,023
I come around looking
for a spot for a blind...

1354
01:52:11,957 --> 01:52:13,226
then I smelled him.

1355
01:52:14,827 --> 01:52:16,129
Smelled him.

1356
01:52:17,229 --> 01:52:19,098
Found that buck

1357
01:52:19,131 --> 01:52:21,367
holed up to a hollow trunk,

1358
01:52:22,201 --> 01:52:23,903
dead for days.

1359
01:52:25,237 --> 01:52:26,806
The smell...

1360
01:52:28,073 --> 01:52:29,943
Never hunted a day since.

1361
01:52:33,412 --> 01:52:35,381
This is the same smell.

1362
01:52:51,297 --> 01:52:52,799
Billy.

1363
01:53:12,284 --> 01:53:13,486
Oh, my God!

1364
01:53:46,518 --> 01:53:47,553
Fuck.

1365
01:53:47,586 --> 01:53:50,122
Fuck, Danno. What the fuck?

1366
01:53:50,155 --> 01:53:52,892
They didn't even bury him deep.
They buried him shallow.

1367
01:53:52,925 --> 01:53:53,927
I'm sorry, Billy.

1368
01:53:55,561 --> 01:53:57,230
What did you
get us into?

1369
01:54:05,638 --> 01:54:07,206
The people
who did that...

1370
01:54:07,239 --> 01:54:08,374
They're not people.

1371
01:54:09,642 --> 01:54:12,478
No. No, they ain't.

1372
01:54:12,511 --> 01:54:14,247
Anyone do that to a little boy,

1373
01:54:15,581 --> 01:54:17,917
they ain't people.

1374
01:54:17,950 --> 01:54:19,151
Did you get it?

1375
01:54:19,184 --> 01:54:20,286
Yeah, we got it.

1376
01:54:20,319 --> 01:54:22,154
Is she back?

1377
01:54:22,187 --> 01:54:24,090
We're heading back to you.
We'll be back in the morning.

1378
01:54:24,123 --> 01:54:25,225
We got a stop to make.

1379
01:54:27,626 --> 01:54:30,096
I need you to show your parents
what's happening.

1380
01:54:30,596 --> 01:54:32,298
No.

1381
01:54:32,331 --> 01:54:34,634
- Yeah.
- No. They almost think I'm normal.

1382
01:54:34,667 --> 01:54:36,269
If I tell them, they'll...

1383
01:54:36,302 --> 01:54:37,970
Rose'll go through them
to get to you.

1384
01:54:38,003 --> 01:54:39,405
You know that, don't you?

1385
01:54:39,438 --> 01:54:41,240
She'll cut them down
without a second thought.

1386
01:54:41,273 --> 01:54:43,076
And she's coming, Abra.

1387
01:54:43,575 --> 01:54:45,445
They need to know.

1388
01:54:50,182 --> 01:54:52,418
So, what's this stop
we gotta make?

1389
01:54:52,451 --> 01:54:54,587
You still got
those old deer rifles?

1390
01:55:12,204 --> 01:55:14,006
You're Uncle Dan?

1391
01:55:14,039 --> 01:55:15,374
- The fuck you think you are?
- Sir...

1392
01:55:15,407 --> 01:55:17,376
Hmm? Hmm? She is 13 years old!

1393
01:55:17,409 --> 01:55:18,711
Abra, I told you to show him.

1394
01:55:18,744 --> 01:55:20,513
- I told him.
- Well, that's not the same.

1395
01:55:20,546 --> 01:55:21,948
I'm gonna kick your ass
before I call the police, huh?

1396
01:55:21,981 --> 01:55:23,115
- Hey, hey, hey!
- No, no, no. Abra.

1397
01:55:23,148 --> 01:55:24,283
Now, don't you say her name.

1398
01:55:24,316 --> 01:55:25,351
Abra...

1399
01:55:40,232 --> 01:55:43,502
I'm sorry, Mr. Stone.
I am a friend.

1400
01:55:43,535 --> 01:55:46,005
Everything she told you
is true.

1401
01:55:48,774 --> 01:55:50,509
What the hell is happening?

1402
01:55:50,542 --> 01:55:52,311
I'm sorry.

1403
01:55:52,344 --> 01:55:54,680
Abra needs to
show you something.

1404
01:55:54,713 --> 01:55:56,115
I saw the boy.

1405
01:55:56,148 --> 01:55:57,150
I saw his body.

1406
01:55:57,783 --> 01:55:59,318
It's all true.

1407
01:55:59,351 --> 01:56:00,687
Probably, your friend here
put him there.

1408
01:56:02,054 --> 01:56:03,723
You think about that?

1409
01:56:03,756 --> 01:56:05,191
Not for long, I didn't.

1410
01:56:05,224 --> 01:56:07,526
Mr. Stone,
your daughter is special.

1411
01:56:07,559 --> 01:56:08,761
Don't talk about her.

1412
01:56:08,794 --> 01:56:11,097
I think you know that.
Deep down.

1413
01:56:12,664 --> 01:56:15,401
She knows what happened
to that little boy,

1414
01:56:15,434 --> 01:56:17,236
and she knows who did it.

1415
01:56:18,237 --> 01:56:19,305
Show him.

1416
01:56:23,675 --> 01:56:25,177
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1417
01:56:25,210 --> 01:56:27,446
I really didn't want to.

1418
01:56:27,479 --> 01:56:28,581
Didn't want to what?

1419
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:48,234
No, thanks.

1420
01:56:48,267 --> 01:56:49,602
No.

1421
01:56:58,544 --> 01:56:59,779
Those people...

1422
01:57:01,580 --> 01:57:03,449
they know about my daughter?

1423
01:57:03,482 --> 01:57:05,184
They do.

1424
01:57:05,217 --> 01:57:07,653
And sooner or later,
they're coming.

1425
01:57:07,686 --> 01:57:09,288
We gotta do something.

1426
01:57:09,321 --> 01:57:11,357
All right, we're calling
the police, the FBI...

1427
01:57:11,390 --> 01:57:14,093
These people have been
around a long, long time, sir.

1428
01:57:14,126 --> 01:57:15,628
They're rich, connected.

1429
01:57:15,661 --> 01:57:18,197
I don't think they're worried
about the police.

1430
01:57:18,230 --> 01:57:19,665
But where are they?

1431
01:57:19,698 --> 01:57:22,134
When are they coming?
Where can we go?

1432
01:57:22,167 --> 01:57:24,170
Abra can answer that...

1433
01:57:24,203 --> 01:57:25,505
if she's ready.

1434
01:57:26,672 --> 01:57:27,740
I'm ready.

1435
01:57:37,716 --> 01:57:39,718
You sure you wanna do this?

1436
01:57:39,751 --> 01:57:41,220
I have to.

1437
01:58:23,462 --> 01:58:25,231
I-95.

1438
01:58:25,264 --> 01:58:27,633
Barry, the Crow, the Snake,
and a few others.

1439
01:58:27,666 --> 01:58:29,535
The trees haven't
changed that much,

1440
01:58:29,568 --> 01:58:31,904
so maybe Massachusetts,

1441
01:58:31,937 --> 01:58:33,839
- but they're close.
- Rose?

1442
01:58:33,872 --> 01:58:35,741
Didn't see her.

1443
01:58:35,774 --> 01:58:37,310
But they're coming.

1444
01:58:41,213 --> 01:58:43,582
This is the only room she saw?

1445
01:58:43,615 --> 01:58:44,917
That's right.

1446
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:48,320
And I made a few changes.
Hid a few things.

1447
01:58:48,353 --> 01:58:50,356
All right.

1448
01:58:50,389 --> 01:58:52,625
Well, they'll be trying
to track you,

1449
01:58:52,658 --> 01:58:54,460
trying to catch on.

1450
01:58:56,328 --> 01:58:57,630
And you're gonna let them.

1451
01:58:59,198 --> 01:59:00,499
Are you crazy?

1452
01:59:00,532 --> 01:59:02,768
Possibly, but you're
gonna let them.

1453
01:59:02,801 --> 01:59:05,304
And then I need you to try
and do a little trick.

1454
01:59:06,338 --> 01:59:07,640
A magic trick?

1455
01:59:15,514 --> 01:59:17,550
They're following us.

1456
01:59:17,583 --> 01:59:20,419
Concentrate. You gotta keep it
up until they land.

1457
01:59:20,452 --> 01:59:21,420
I know.

1458
01:59:53,385 --> 01:59:54,687
This should work.

1459
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:57,256
Good blinds over there,
and there.

1460
02:00:00,559 --> 02:00:01,660
They still close?

1461
02:00:01,693 --> 02:00:02,795
Getting closer, I think.

1462
02:00:03,695 --> 02:00:04,830
This is tough.

1463
02:00:04,863 --> 02:00:07,366
I know. I know.
Not much longer.

1464
02:00:10,969 --> 02:00:12,572
Okay, Crow Daddy,

1465
02:00:13,572 --> 02:00:14,874
go get her.

1466
02:01:01,820 --> 02:01:04,490
You look relaxed.

1467
02:01:04,523 --> 02:01:06,926
You feel relaxed,
don't you, Abra?

1468
02:01:08,327 --> 02:01:09,395
I guess.

1469
02:01:09,428 --> 02:01:10,563
You should.

1470
02:01:11,363 --> 02:01:12,998
Just relax.

1471
02:01:13,031 --> 02:01:14,667
We're friends.

1472
02:01:14,700 --> 02:01:16,435
You're friends.

1473
02:01:16,468 --> 02:01:17,603
That's right.

1474
02:01:18,637 --> 02:01:20,739
Just friends.

1475
02:01:20,772 --> 02:01:23,809
And we want to take you
to meet more friends.

1476
02:01:25,577 --> 02:01:26,712
Good friends.

1477
02:01:31,049 --> 02:01:32,551
Well, shit.

1478
02:01:32,584 --> 02:01:34,053
The way they talked you up,

1479
02:01:34,086 --> 02:01:36,088
I was thinking it'd be
a little harder than that.

1480
02:01:40,892 --> 02:01:42,628
The fuck?

1481
02:01:42,661 --> 02:01:44,897
Parlor tricks.
Just fuckin' parlor tricks.

1482
02:01:49,501 --> 02:01:50,869
No! Get out of there!

1483
02:01:50,902 --> 02:01:51,971
Get out of there!

1484
02:01:58,510 --> 02:02:01,013
No!

1485
02:02:14,059 --> 02:02:15,094
No!

1486
02:02:24,903 --> 02:02:26,071
You deserve it.

1487
02:02:26,104 --> 02:02:28,741
You deserve it. All of you.

1488
02:02:33,879 --> 02:02:34,847
No!

1489
02:03:30,602 --> 02:03:31,737
Oh, fuck.

1490
02:03:33,839 --> 02:03:34,807
Stop.

1491
02:03:39,644 --> 02:03:42,481
I just got one question
for you, sweetie.

1492
02:03:43,782 --> 02:03:45,484
Aren't you sleepy?

1493
02:03:48,053 --> 02:03:49,755
You're sleepy.

1494
02:03:54,659 --> 02:03:55,694
Sleep.

1495
02:03:57,829 --> 02:03:59,031
Sleep.

1496
02:04:00,532 --> 02:04:03,035
Wake up! Uncle Dan!

1497
02:04:03,068 --> 02:04:05,571
Wake up! Wake up.

1498
02:04:05,604 --> 02:04:06,939
Wake up!

1499
02:04:07,906 --> 02:04:09,508
Fucking men.

1500
02:04:11,142 --> 02:04:13,012
Fucking men.

1501
02:04:29,528 --> 02:04:30,963
Stay back, Billy.

1502
02:04:33,965 --> 02:04:35,668
Kill yourself.

1503
02:04:38,203 --> 02:04:39,571
No!

1504
02:04:39,604 --> 02:04:41,106
Billy!

1505
02:04:57,289 --> 02:04:59,725
There is one missing.

1506
02:04:59,758 --> 02:05:02,160
I didn't see the Crow.
Where is the Crow?

1507
02:05:04,563 --> 02:05:05,831
Hello, Abra.

1508
02:05:12,037 --> 02:05:13,639
Abra!

1509
02:05:17,242 --> 02:05:19,011
Get away from her.

1510
02:05:22,147 --> 02:05:23,148
Step back.

1511
02:05:26,151 --> 02:05:27,820
Sure thing, Dad.

1512
02:05:29,654 --> 02:05:31,623
You know, I'm glad
I got to meet you.

1513
02:05:31,656 --> 02:05:34,259
I'll fucking kill you.
Step back.

1514
02:05:34,292 --> 02:05:36,128
Some brave words.

1515
02:05:36,161 --> 02:05:39,698
Always tickles me,
watching you rubes threaten a god.

1516
02:05:40,832 --> 02:05:42,968
You know, your little girl,

1517
02:05:43,001 --> 02:05:46,605
she's maybe the best food
we'll ever have.

1518
02:05:46,638 --> 02:05:49,808
I'm so glad I had a chance
to compliment the chef.

1519
02:06:27,979 --> 02:06:29,748
Oh, good, you're awake.

1520
02:06:40,158 --> 02:06:41,293
Dan...

1521
02:06:41,326 --> 02:06:42,795
Don't bother.

1522
02:06:50,001 --> 02:06:51,937
What's wrong with me?

1523
02:06:51,970 --> 02:06:54,039
You've been dosed, missy.

1524
02:06:54,072 --> 02:06:56,808
More than
I've ever used before.

1525
02:06:56,841 --> 02:06:59,144
Might let you wake up
here and there,

1526
02:06:59,177 --> 02:07:01,647
but that steam of yours
is fast asleep.

1527
02:07:04,916 --> 02:07:06,118
My dad...

1528
02:07:07,352 --> 02:07:09,187
What happened to my dad?

1529
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:10,990
Lot of good people
killed today.

1530
02:07:11,956 --> 02:07:13,359
Lot of good people.

1531
02:07:15,060 --> 02:07:17,362
I'd love to tell you
someone will pay,

1532
02:07:17,395 --> 02:07:22,334
some kind of justice raining
down on the sad events today,

1533
02:07:22,367 --> 02:07:24,870
but it don't work like that.

1534
02:07:24,903 --> 02:07:26,672
We were always gonna have you.

1535
02:07:27,939 --> 02:07:30,242
Some of my people are dead.

1536
02:07:30,275 --> 02:07:31,944
Some of yours are dead.

1537
02:07:33,044 --> 02:07:36,014
Outcome didn't change, though.

1538
02:07:36,047 --> 02:07:37,316
Think on that a minute.

1539
02:07:38,383 --> 02:07:39,985
The outcome didn't change.

1540
02:07:40,885 --> 02:07:42,154
So, their deaths,

1541
02:07:43,154 --> 02:07:44,990
all of them,

1542
02:07:45,023 --> 02:07:47,292
just a waste.

1543
02:07:47,325 --> 02:07:48,727
A waste you brought on

1544
02:07:48,760 --> 02:07:50,829
to us all, young lady.

1545
02:07:50,862 --> 02:07:51,997
For what?

1546
02:07:53,898 --> 02:07:55,767
Please hear me...

1547
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:58,704
Ain't nobody
hearing you.

1548
02:07:58,737 --> 02:08:01,106
Might as well calm down
and enjoy the ride.

1549
02:08:02,140 --> 02:08:04,409
Like I said,

1550
02:08:04,442 --> 02:08:06,712
outcome hasn't changed.

1551
02:08:26,998 --> 02:08:28,200
No.

1552
02:08:29,934 --> 02:08:31,369
Please.

1553
02:08:31,402 --> 02:08:33,472
Oh, please, please, please.

1554
02:08:35,039 --> 02:08:36,075
Please.

1555
02:08:39,778 --> 02:08:41,046
Abra!

1556
02:08:44,315 --> 02:08:45,718
Abra.

1557
02:08:52,791 --> 02:08:54,059
Tony?

1558
02:08:56,094 --> 02:08:57,963
Help me, please, Tony.

1559
02:09:03,568 --> 02:09:04,870
God.

1560
02:09:15,213 --> 02:09:17,415
Okay. Okay.

1561
02:09:17,448 --> 02:09:18,984
Okay, okay.

1562
02:09:19,017 --> 02:09:21,419
Okay, you always said...

1563
02:09:21,452 --> 02:09:23,221
Your brain was like a radio.

1564
02:09:23,254 --> 02:09:26,057
No one's answering when you
call, so stop calling.

1565
02:09:26,090 --> 02:09:27,493
And just listen.

1566
02:09:45,243 --> 02:09:47,579
Dan. Dan.

1567
02:09:47,612 --> 02:09:49,014
Help.

1568
02:10:03,094 --> 02:10:04,196
Hi.

1569
02:10:04,229 --> 02:10:05,297
Dan.

1570
02:10:08,499 --> 02:10:09,868
Did he drug you?

1571
02:10:11,236 --> 02:10:12,404
I'm so sorry.

1572
02:10:14,172 --> 02:10:16,107
I'm gonna try something, okay?

1573
02:10:16,140 --> 02:10:17,108
But you're weak.

1574
02:10:17,141 --> 02:10:18,977
He's blocking you.

1575
02:10:19,010 --> 02:10:21,146
I could barely hear you.

1576
02:10:21,179 --> 02:10:22,848
You gotta trust me, okay?

1577
02:10:24,482 --> 02:10:25,951
Okay?

1578
02:10:39,898 --> 02:10:42,300
Awake again, huh?

1579
02:10:42,333 --> 02:10:45,504
Might have to
dose you at the next rest stop.

1580
02:10:47,572 --> 02:10:49,074
Where are we going?

1581
02:10:50,041 --> 02:10:51,276
Mm, you know where.

1582
02:10:52,343 --> 02:10:54,413
Fuck, I feel hungover.

1583
02:10:57,282 --> 02:10:59,951
I told you it's good shit.

1584
02:10:59,984 --> 02:11:03,088
Haven't felt hungover in years.
And, you know, I don't miss it.

1585
02:11:03,121 --> 02:11:04,323
Not even a little.

1586
02:11:06,457 --> 02:11:08,260
West, huh?

1587
02:11:08,293 --> 02:11:11,196
Stayin' off the major roads.
Smart.

1588
02:11:13,264 --> 02:11:16,001
Crownville. New York.

1589
02:11:19,170 --> 02:11:21,406
Who are you?

1590
02:11:21,439 --> 02:11:23,242
I'm the guy
that killed your friends.

1591
02:11:29,213 --> 02:11:30,582
It's nice to meet you.

1592
02:11:32,450 --> 02:11:34,085
Neat trick.

1593
02:11:34,118 --> 02:11:36,054
Haven't seen this one before.

1594
02:11:36,087 --> 02:11:37,656
Wanna see one more?

1595
02:11:41,092 --> 02:11:44,563
Don't imagine Rose'll be too
happy if you shoot the prize.

1596
02:11:47,298 --> 02:11:50,702
I don't suppose Rose will be
happy about any of this.

1597
02:11:50,735 --> 02:11:53,471
And when that woman gets mad...

1598
02:11:53,504 --> 02:11:56,107
Well, it seems to me
you know enough

1599
02:11:56,140 --> 02:11:59,010
to know you might wanna
sit this one out.

1600
02:11:59,043 --> 02:12:00,478
Count your blessings.

1601
02:12:00,511 --> 02:12:02,347
Go on your way.

1602
02:12:04,515 --> 02:12:06,184
What's so funny, friend?

1603
02:12:06,217 --> 02:12:10,188
Well, it's just arrogance.
It's arrogance, really.

1604
02:12:10,221 --> 02:12:13,591
But it makes sense,
if you think you're gonna live forever.

1605
02:12:13,624 --> 02:12:17,996
Stands to reason,
of course you wouldn't wear your seatbelt.

1606
02:12:27,572 --> 02:12:30,676
No!

1607
02:12:41,219 --> 02:12:42,387
Dan?

1608
02:12:44,022 --> 02:12:45,290
Dan?

1609
02:13:16,587 --> 02:13:18,156
I hope that hurts.

1610
02:13:18,723 --> 02:13:20,058
Rosie...

1611
02:13:21,092 --> 02:13:22,127
A lot.

1612
02:14:10,141 --> 02:14:12,177
You little bitch.

1613
02:14:14,278 --> 02:14:16,348
What have you done?

1614
02:14:27,725 --> 02:14:29,494
All right, bitch child.

1615
02:14:30,528 --> 02:14:31,430
All right.

1616
02:15:39,830 --> 02:15:41,266
Sorry.

1617
02:15:41,299 --> 02:15:42,433
Dozed off.

1618
02:15:42,466 --> 02:15:44,169
No, you earned it.

1619
02:15:47,505 --> 02:15:48,706
Where are we?

1620
02:15:48,739 --> 02:15:50,208
Ohio.

1621
02:15:50,741 --> 02:15:51,843
Where are we going?

1622
02:15:51,876 --> 02:15:52,878
Colorado.

1623
02:15:54,579 --> 02:15:56,148
Why Colorado?

1624
02:15:58,649 --> 02:16:00,418
She's gonna keep coming.

1625
02:16:01,552 --> 02:16:03,155
- I know.
- Always.

1626
02:16:04,522 --> 02:16:05,890
This only ends if we end it,

1627
02:16:05,923 --> 02:16:08,359
and I don't think
we can beat her.

1628
02:16:08,392 --> 02:16:09,828
Not by ourselves.

1629
02:16:11,996 --> 02:16:13,631
There's a place.

1630
02:16:13,664 --> 02:16:16,467
A place that's dangerous
for people like us.

1631
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:19,637
The place you told me about?
The hungry place?

1632
02:16:19,670 --> 02:16:21,306
Yeah, that's right.

1633
02:16:21,339 --> 02:16:24,209
If it's so dangerous,
why would we go there?

1634
02:16:24,242 --> 02:16:26,611
Well, if it's dangerous
for people like us,

1635
02:16:26,644 --> 02:16:29,547
I expect it's dangerous
for people like her.

1636
02:16:29,580 --> 02:16:31,316
Maybe even more so.

1637
02:16:32,383 --> 02:16:33,351
Good.

1638
02:16:34,452 --> 02:16:36,221
She's following us, you know.

1639
02:16:37,321 --> 02:16:39,224
Yeah, good. Let her.

1640
02:16:46,831 --> 02:16:48,533
I'm sorry about your father.

1641
02:16:51,302 --> 02:16:52,771
Sorry about your friend.

1642
02:17:15,593 --> 02:17:17,996
It's my mom.

1643
02:17:18,029 --> 02:17:19,364
What do I say to her?

1644
02:17:24,035 --> 02:17:24,969
Hi, Mom.

1645
02:17:25,002 --> 02:17:26,337
Oh, thank God!

1646
02:17:26,370 --> 02:17:27,505
Abra...

1647
02:17:27,538 --> 02:17:29,241
Are you okay? Where are you?

1648
02:17:30,074 --> 02:17:31,476
I love you.

1649
02:17:34,512 --> 02:17:36,848
When we're safe, you'll call her
and tell her where to find us?

1650
02:17:36,881 --> 02:17:38,016
I will.

1651
02:17:38,049 --> 02:17:39,451
Okay.

1652
02:18:13,084 --> 02:18:15,487
Not too much further.
Up the mountain.

1653
02:19:51,048 --> 02:19:52,817
Here's what we're gonna do.

1654
02:19:52,850 --> 02:19:55,686
You're gonna stay in the car,
keep the heater running.

1655
02:19:55,719 --> 02:19:58,890
I don't want you spending a minute
inside there if you don't have to.

1656
02:19:58,923 --> 02:20:00,658
She can only come from here.

1657
02:20:00,691 --> 02:20:02,193
You can see her a mile out,
easy.

1658
02:20:02,226 --> 02:20:04,562
You see lights
on the mountain over there,

1659
02:20:04,595 --> 02:20:06,130
you blast me, okay?

1660
02:20:06,163 --> 02:20:09,600
But I don't want you going in.
Not until she's here.

1661
02:20:09,633 --> 02:20:12,103
You aren't waiting with me?

1662
02:20:12,136 --> 02:20:13,070
I can't.

1663
02:20:13,103 --> 02:20:14,105
Why not?

1664
02:20:15,072 --> 02:20:16,674
I have to wake it up.

1665
02:21:18,669 --> 02:21:19,904
Wakey-wakey.

1666
02:25:59,449 --> 02:26:01,352
Slow night, Mr. Torrance.

1667
02:26:01,385 --> 02:26:03,254
Not for long, I imagine.

1668
02:26:05,055 --> 02:26:07,057
You're a whiskey man,
are you not?

1669
02:26:07,090 --> 02:26:09,193
I was, most of the time.

1670
02:26:16,867 --> 02:26:18,269
On the house.

1671
02:26:22,039 --> 02:26:24,175
This was your brand.

1672
02:26:24,208 --> 02:26:26,010
Jack Daniel's.

1673
02:26:26,043 --> 02:26:28,412
I used to see the bottles
in our home.

1674
02:26:28,445 --> 02:26:31,949
Our real home, before all this.

1675
02:26:31,982 --> 02:26:35,153
I smelled one once. It smelled
like something on fire,

1676
02:26:36,320 --> 02:26:38,989
which I suppose it was.

1677
02:26:39,022 --> 02:26:41,525
I'm afraid you've
confused me with someone else.

1678
02:26:41,558 --> 02:26:43,094
It's Lloyd.

1679
02:26:43,594 --> 02:26:44,996
Lloyd.

1680
02:26:46,330 --> 02:26:48,465
I apologize, Mr. Torrance.

1681
02:26:48,498 --> 02:26:52,403
I don't know where everyone is,
but it'll pick up.

1682
02:26:52,436 --> 02:26:54,305
Oh, I know where they are.

1683
02:26:54,338 --> 02:26:55,439
And you're right...

1684
02:26:56,306 --> 02:26:57,475
it'll pick up.

1685
02:26:59,643 --> 02:27:02,446
If you don't mind my saying,
Mr. Torrance, you seem...

1686
02:27:04,081 --> 02:27:05,216
put upon.

1687
02:27:06,216 --> 02:27:08,052
Put upon?

1688
02:27:08,085 --> 02:27:09,353
Ain't that the way.

1689
02:27:10,354 --> 02:27:12,289
Man just living his life,

1690
02:27:12,322 --> 02:27:14,391
trying to do his work.

1691
02:27:14,424 --> 02:27:16,493
He gets put upon.

1692
02:27:16,526 --> 02:27:18,262
Pulled into
other people's problems.

1693
02:27:18,295 --> 02:27:21,132
I see it all the time,
if you don't mind my saying.

1694
02:27:24,101 --> 02:27:26,103
So we lived in Florida.

1695
02:27:27,137 --> 02:27:28,138
I'm sorry?

1696
02:27:28,171 --> 02:27:30,207
Mom and I.

1697
02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:32,510
I'm afraid I don't know
who you mean.

1698
02:27:35,045 --> 02:27:38,015
We never wanted
to see snow again,

1699
02:27:38,048 --> 02:27:40,217
so we lived in Florida.

1700
02:27:40,250 --> 02:27:43,487
Tiny place, but it was
comfortable, and we were happy.

1701
02:27:43,520 --> 02:27:45,423
I mean, we were grieving.

1702
02:27:48,191 --> 02:27:50,127
We were traumatized,

1703
02:27:50,160 --> 02:27:51,929
but there was happiness too.

1704
02:27:55,132 --> 02:27:56,100
She...

1705
02:27:57,634 --> 02:27:59,904
She would look away.

1706
02:27:59,937 --> 02:28:03,341
She'd look at me, but she'd always
look away after a second or two.

1707
02:28:04,608 --> 02:28:06,443
It took me a while
to notice it.

1708
02:28:06,476 --> 02:28:08,913
But after the Overlook, she
wouldn't look me in the eyes,

1709
02:28:08,946 --> 02:28:10,648
not for long.

1710
02:28:10,681 --> 02:28:12,283
Couldn't figure it out.

1711
02:28:14,718 --> 02:28:15,719
But it...

1712
02:28:19,589 --> 02:28:20,958
It was you.

1713
02:28:23,293 --> 02:28:26,964
She saw your eyes in me,
and she'd have to look away.

1714
02:28:28,332 --> 02:28:30,167
It tortured her
to have to do that.

1715
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:32,069
So, I fixed it.

1716
02:28:32,102 --> 02:28:35,105
I fixed it for her, and it was
the last time I ever used it.

1717
02:28:35,138 --> 02:28:38,175
So that she wouldn't see you
anymore when she looked at me.

1718
02:28:41,244 --> 02:28:43,514
I was 20 when she died.

1719
02:28:43,547 --> 02:28:47,384
And back then, I saw
when someone was gonna die.

1720
02:28:47,417 --> 02:28:49,586
I saw flies. Black flies.

1721
02:28:49,619 --> 02:28:53,457
"Death flies," I called them,
circling people's faces.

1722
02:28:53,490 --> 02:28:56,327
And in those last weeks,
she was covered...

1723
02:28:56,360 --> 02:28:58,195
Her whole face.

1724
02:28:58,228 --> 02:29:01,332
I could barely see her eyes.

1725
02:29:01,365 --> 02:29:06,270
And I... I tried to comfort her,
but I could hardly look at her.

1726
02:29:06,303 --> 02:29:08,205
And she saw that.

1727
02:29:10,540 --> 02:29:12,609
She just lay there dying,

1728
02:29:12,642 --> 02:29:14,545
with her son
who couldn't look at her.

1729
02:29:20,584 --> 02:29:24,254
Maybe something warm to
push away such unpleasantries.

1730
02:29:24,287 --> 02:29:27,324
Don't you wanna hear about it?
She was your wife.

1731
02:29:27,357 --> 02:29:30,461
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

1732
02:29:30,494 --> 02:29:33,764
- I'm just a bartender.
- Oh, yeah?

1733
02:29:33,797 --> 02:29:37,034
Just Lloyd the bartender,
pouring joy at the Overlook Hotel.

1734
02:29:37,067 --> 02:29:39,637
I'll pour whatever you like,
Mr. Torrance.

1735
02:29:41,238 --> 02:29:42,373
Oh, Dad.

1736
02:29:44,307 --> 02:29:46,510
This drink will cost
an awful lot.

1737
02:29:46,543 --> 02:29:48,545
Your money is no good here.

1738
02:29:48,578 --> 02:29:50,414
Orders from the house.

1739
02:29:50,447 --> 02:29:52,383
It'll cost more than money.

1740
02:29:52,416 --> 02:29:54,752
It'll cost me eight years.

1741
02:29:54,785 --> 02:29:57,287
Eight behind me, and who knows
how many in front of me.

1742
02:29:57,320 --> 02:29:59,757
Your credit is fine,
Mr. Torrance.

1743
02:30:07,230 --> 02:30:09,100
Man takes a drink,

1744
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:11,502
the drink takes a drink,

1745
02:30:12,669 --> 02:30:14,505
and then the drink takes a man.

1746
02:30:15,572 --> 02:30:17,274
Ain't it so, Dad?

1747
02:30:21,411 --> 02:30:22,713
Medicine.

1748
02:30:24,414 --> 02:30:26,283
Medicine is what it is.

1749
02:30:27,284 --> 02:30:29,520
Bona fide cure-all.

1750
02:30:29,553 --> 02:30:34,392
Depression, stress, remorse,
failure, wipes it all away.

1751
02:30:36,159 --> 02:30:38,229
The mind is a blackboard.

1752
02:30:38,695 --> 02:30:40,031
And this

1753
02:30:40,730 --> 02:30:42,233
is the eraser.

1754
02:30:47,504 --> 02:30:49,606
A man tries.

1755
02:30:49,639 --> 02:30:50,775
He provides.

1756
02:30:52,175 --> 02:30:54,344
But he's surrounded by mouths.

1757
02:30:54,377 --> 02:30:57,481
That eat, and scream, and cry,
and nag.

1758
02:30:57,514 --> 02:31:01,118
So, he asks for one thing,
just one thing for him.

1759
02:31:01,151 --> 02:31:02,653
To warm him up...

1760
02:31:02,686 --> 02:31:05,722
to take the sting out of
those days of the mouths,

1761
02:31:05,755 --> 02:31:08,492
eating, and eating, and eating
everything he makes,

1762
02:31:08,525 --> 02:31:11,095
everything he has.

1763
02:31:11,128 --> 02:31:12,663
And a family.

1764
02:31:12,696 --> 02:31:14,799
A wife, a kid.

1765
02:31:16,333 --> 02:31:18,669
Those mouths eat time.

1766
02:31:18,702 --> 02:31:20,304
They eat your days on Earth.

1767
02:31:21,705 --> 02:31:23,307
They just gobble them up.

1768
02:31:24,774 --> 02:31:27,178
It's enough to make a man sick.

1769
02:31:28,145 --> 02:31:29,213
And this...

1770
02:31:30,547 --> 02:31:32,450
is the medicine.

1771
02:31:34,584 --> 02:31:37,521
So, tell me, pup,

1772
02:31:37,554 --> 02:31:40,191
are you gonna
take your medicine?

1773
02:31:43,226 --> 02:31:44,795
I'm not.

1774
02:31:46,830 --> 02:31:48,165
Oh.

1775
02:31:48,198 --> 02:31:49,533
Look at that. I'm sorry.

1776
02:31:49,566 --> 02:31:52,536
Clumsy old me, Mr. Torrance.
Forgive me.

1777
02:31:54,171 --> 02:31:55,539
Let's get you cleaned up.

1778
02:32:13,857 --> 02:32:15,826
Management is concerned.

1779
02:32:15,859 --> 02:32:17,228
Concerned?

1780
02:32:19,596 --> 02:32:22,166
It's horrible
what she's done to you.

1781
02:32:22,199 --> 02:32:23,868
Pulled you into her mess.

1782
02:32:26,369 --> 02:32:27,738
A smart man?

1783
02:32:28,772 --> 02:32:31,775
He'd let her handle it.

1784
02:32:31,808 --> 02:32:35,312
Let things unfold
as they're meant to.

1785
02:32:35,345 --> 02:32:37,715
Why should you
pay her tab, Doc?

1786
02:32:39,449 --> 02:32:41,485
And for what?

1787
02:32:41,518 --> 02:32:45,355
For this little girl
who started all this trouble?

1788
02:32:45,388 --> 02:32:47,925
What would management
have me do about that?

1789
02:32:48,592 --> 02:32:50,727
Nothing.

1790
02:32:50,760 --> 02:32:53,664
Easiest thing in the world
to do, son.

1791
02:32:53,697 --> 02:32:55,866
Just bring her inside.

1792
02:32:55,899 --> 02:32:58,368
And then, well,

1793
02:32:58,401 --> 02:33:01,505
you accept the things
you cannot change.

1794
02:33:02,672 --> 02:33:03,807
Dan!

1795
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:04,875
She's here.

1796
02:33:22,892 --> 02:33:24,361
Okay.

1797
02:33:38,808 --> 02:33:41,511
This place is sick.

1798
02:33:41,544 --> 02:33:43,880
Sick like my momo was sick.

1799
02:33:43,913 --> 02:33:45,515
It's cancer,

1800
02:33:45,548 --> 02:33:47,818
only worse.

1801
02:33:55,058 --> 02:33:56,627
What do we do now?

1802
02:33:56,660 --> 02:33:58,696
We head inside. She'll find us.

1803
02:35:48,671 --> 02:35:51,375
Well, well, well.

1804
02:35:52,876 --> 02:35:54,578
Hi there.

1805
02:35:54,611 --> 02:35:57,814
When this starts, run.

1806
02:35:57,847 --> 02:36:00,684
Yes, you run, dear.

1807
02:36:00,717 --> 02:36:03,053
And then I will find you

1808
02:36:03,086 --> 02:36:06,957
and you will scream for years
until you die.

1809
02:36:09,025 --> 02:36:11,661
We'll see
who does the screaming.

1810
02:36:11,694 --> 02:36:13,463
Oh, we'll see indeed.

1811
02:36:13,496 --> 02:36:15,465
She's right, you know.

1812
02:36:15,498 --> 02:36:16,967
You should be afraid.

1813
02:36:18,134 --> 02:36:20,537
Why is that?

1814
02:36:20,570 --> 02:36:23,140
Because you don't know
where you're standing.

1815
02:36:23,173 --> 02:36:25,409
I'm sorry, who are you,
handsome?

1816
02:36:29,712 --> 02:36:32,916
You're the one who killed
my Crow, aren't you?

1817
02:36:34,551 --> 02:36:35,552
Go.

1818
02:37:36,746 --> 02:37:39,015
Clever.

1819
02:37:39,048 --> 02:37:40,884
You've made some improvements,
haven't you?

1820
02:37:42,552 --> 02:37:45,055
Since the last time
I was in your mind.

1821
02:37:45,088 --> 02:37:46,890
How do you know
we're not in yours?

1822
02:38:01,671 --> 02:38:02,806
Where are you, pup?

1823
02:38:23,693 --> 02:38:25,162
You're gonna die here.

1824
02:38:26,129 --> 02:38:29,299
Mm. Brave words, dear.

1825
02:38:29,332 --> 02:38:31,001
Is that what you really think?

1826
02:38:31,768 --> 02:38:34,538
You're gonna hurt me?

1827
02:38:34,571 --> 02:38:35,805
Yes.

1828
02:38:42,145 --> 02:38:45,249
You know,
you remind me of myself.

1829
02:38:46,983 --> 02:38:49,553
I can really see it now.

1830
02:38:49,586 --> 02:38:51,955
You've got a darkness in you,
dear.

1831
02:38:51,988 --> 02:38:55,526
I think the only difference
between you and me is time.

1832
02:39:05,001 --> 02:39:06,603
You don't know yet...

1833
02:39:07,270 --> 02:39:08,672
what you'd do...

1834
02:39:09,606 --> 02:39:12,242
for more time.

1835
02:39:12,275 --> 02:39:15,779
But I promise you, dear,
oh, you'd be surprised.

1836
02:39:21,217 --> 02:39:23,120
Pain purifies steam.

1837
02:39:24,220 --> 02:39:28,091
Fear, too, so, you understand.

1838
02:39:47,944 --> 02:39:50,714
I was just like you
when I was younger.

1839
02:39:50,747 --> 02:39:52,115
I was special

1840
02:39:53,082 --> 02:39:55,118
and alone.

1841
02:39:55,151 --> 02:39:57,787
But I met someone who gave me the
gift of purpose, of community.

1842
02:39:57,820 --> 02:39:59,823
And I might have given you
such a gift

1843
02:39:59,856 --> 02:40:02,759
if things would
have gone differently.

1844
02:40:05,428 --> 02:40:07,697
No?

1845
02:40:07,730 --> 02:40:09,633
Defiant, aren't you?

1846
02:40:10,767 --> 02:40:12,168
So much like me.

1847
02:40:12,201 --> 02:40:15,205
Your mind is so...

1848
02:40:17,807 --> 02:40:19,810
This isn't your mind, is it?

1849
02:40:22,378 --> 02:40:24,114
This isn't you at all.

1850
02:40:26,349 --> 02:40:28,685
You're just the bait.

1851
02:40:32,155 --> 02:40:33,123
Enough!

1852
02:40:36,426 --> 02:40:37,928
Run.

1853
02:40:40,129 --> 02:40:42,265
How the hell did we miss you?

1854
02:40:44,167 --> 02:40:45,402
Oh...

1855
02:40:45,435 --> 02:40:48,005
You and I should have met
years ago.

1856
02:40:51,474 --> 02:40:52,743
Danny.

1857
02:40:53,810 --> 02:40:57,714
That's your name, isn't it?

1858
02:40:57,747 --> 02:41:01,217
Well, something happens to the
steam when you rubes get older.

1859
02:41:01,250 --> 02:41:03,386
It gets polluted.

1860
02:41:03,419 --> 02:41:05,121
Dirty.

1861
02:41:05,154 --> 02:41:06,156
You know that.

1862
02:41:07,423 --> 02:41:10,193
I see the grease all over you.

1863
02:41:10,226 --> 02:41:13,196
You don't shine quite the same.

1864
02:41:13,229 --> 02:41:15,766
Growing up spoils that,
I guess.

1865
02:41:18,067 --> 02:41:20,003
Seriously, handsome,

1866
02:41:20,036 --> 02:41:22,739
where have you been hiding?

1867
02:41:25,742 --> 02:41:27,444
I can make you an offer.

1868
02:41:28,945 --> 02:41:30,780
An offer I rarely make.

1869
02:41:30,813 --> 02:41:33,249
Oh, yeah? I can't wait.

1870
02:41:33,282 --> 02:41:35,185
Such a gifted boy

1871
02:41:35,218 --> 02:41:39,055
hiding his light
under a bushel for so long.

1872
02:41:39,088 --> 02:41:43,460
You could live a long, long
time. Live well, too.

1873
02:41:43,493 --> 02:41:48,031
Indulge yourself,
no consequences,

1874
02:41:48,064 --> 02:41:49,700
no hangovers.

1875
02:41:51,300 --> 02:41:53,970
Eat well, live long.

1876
02:41:54,003 --> 02:41:56,973
You must be lonely,
being the last one.

1877
02:41:57,006 --> 02:41:59,142
I mean,
the last one in the world.

1878
02:41:59,175 --> 02:42:01,812
Sweetie, I'm not the last.
Far from it.

1879
02:42:03,045 --> 02:42:04,881
I'm just the prettiest.

1880
02:42:04,914 --> 02:42:06,950
I assume you know my answer.

1881
02:42:08,451 --> 02:42:09,786
Pity.

1882
02:42:09,819 --> 02:42:11,321
So, are we doing this or not?

1883
02:42:28,104 --> 02:42:29,873
Whew.

1884
02:42:32,074 --> 02:42:34,010
Oh, sweetie.

1885
02:42:34,043 --> 02:42:36,813
Oh, look at that, huh?

1886
02:42:38,014 --> 02:42:42,252
I seem to have nicked
your femoral artery there.

1887
02:42:42,285 --> 02:42:44,321
Why, you're gonna
bleed to death, huh?

1888
02:42:50,459 --> 02:42:52,896
My, my, what a temper you have.

1889
02:42:52,929 --> 02:42:54,430
So much fire.

1890
02:42:54,463 --> 02:42:56,232
Such a waste!

1891
02:42:56,265 --> 02:42:57,901
Or maybe not.

1892
02:43:05,041 --> 02:43:07,277
Oh, damn.

1893
02:43:07,310 --> 02:43:09,846
Even at your age...

1894
02:43:09,879 --> 02:43:11,381
It's so good.

1895
02:43:16,586 --> 02:43:18,421
You taste like whiskey.

1896
02:43:24,026 --> 02:43:25,128
Danny!

1897
02:43:26,162 --> 02:43:27,430
Danny boy!

1898
02:43:28,931 --> 02:43:31,034
Oh, so much terror.

1899
02:43:31,067 --> 02:43:32,936
All your life, huh?

1900
02:43:35,371 --> 02:43:36,973
Delicious.

1901
02:43:43,145 --> 02:43:45,081
Don't hurt me!

1902
02:43:47,049 --> 02:43:48,018
Oh, damn.

1903
02:43:52,388 --> 02:43:54,057
What are...
You're not alone in there.

1904
02:43:54,090 --> 02:43:56,292
Huh?

1905
02:43:56,325 --> 02:43:57,561
What are you hiding, huh?

1906
02:44:00,062 --> 02:44:01,564
What's in those?

1907
02:44:01,597 --> 02:44:03,132
Something special, huh?

1908
02:44:03,165 --> 02:44:06,970
They're not special.
They're starving.

1909
02:44:15,444 --> 02:44:17,113
No.

1910
02:44:17,146 --> 02:44:18,414
No!

1911
02:44:55,985 --> 02:44:57,987
Hello, Danny.

1912
02:45:00,022 --> 02:45:01,558
Come and play with us...

1913
02:45:03,359 --> 02:45:05,261
forever...

1914
02:45:05,294 --> 02:45:07,464
...and ever...

1915
02:45:08,998 --> 02:45:10,400
and ever.

1916
02:45:45,034 --> 02:45:46,303
Uncle Dan.

1917
02:45:47,336 --> 02:45:49,205
Uncle Dan, is it done?

1918
02:45:49,238 --> 02:45:51,341
Is she dead?

1919
02:46:13,329 --> 02:46:15,665
Great party, isn't it?

1920
02:46:15,698 --> 02:46:17,067
Abra!

1921
02:46:20,803 --> 02:46:22,038
Abra!

1922
02:46:38,587 --> 02:46:40,023
Abra!

1923
02:46:46,328 --> 02:46:48,064
Abra!

1924
02:47:06,382 --> 02:47:07,550
Try it.

1925
02:47:10,453 --> 02:47:12,221
Oh, there you are.

1926
02:47:12,254 --> 02:47:13,323
Abra.

1927
02:47:14,523 --> 02:47:17,260
You've been very, very bad.

1928
02:47:17,293 --> 02:47:19,429
You're not Uncle Dan.

1929
02:47:19,462 --> 02:47:22,332
You're a mask. A false face.

1930
02:47:23,732 --> 02:47:25,234
Who else would I be?

1931
02:47:25,267 --> 02:47:27,070
You're the hotel.

1932
02:47:27,103 --> 02:47:28,271
But he's still in there.

1933
02:47:28,304 --> 02:47:29,773
Mask is off, then.

1934
02:47:34,577 --> 02:47:36,612
Why are you smiling?

1935
02:47:36,645 --> 02:47:39,182
Because you don't know
where you're standing.

1936
02:47:39,215 --> 02:47:43,086
I know these halls
like my own face, child.

1937
02:47:43,119 --> 02:47:45,221
I mean the body
you're standing in.

1938
02:47:45,254 --> 02:47:47,190
The face you're wearing.

1939
02:47:47,223 --> 02:47:49,092
That's Dan Torrance,
and you don't know him.

1940
02:47:49,125 --> 02:47:50,726
Dan Torrance.

1941
02:47:50,759 --> 02:47:54,497
Dan Torrance made one stop
as soon as he got here.

1942
02:47:55,564 --> 02:47:57,200
To the boiler room.

1943
02:48:21,790 --> 02:48:24,227
There you are.

1944
02:48:25,561 --> 02:48:27,163
You were supposed to run.

1945
02:48:27,196 --> 02:48:28,865
I didn't wanna leave you.

1946
02:48:31,800 --> 02:48:33,670
I'm exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

1947
02:48:35,604 --> 02:48:38,341
I can't hold it off for much
longer. Abra, you need to run.

1948
02:48:38,374 --> 02:48:39,609
No.

1949
02:48:39,642 --> 02:48:41,244
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

1950
02:48:41,277 --> 02:48:43,613
I have to close the door
behind us, right?

1951
02:48:44,647 --> 02:48:46,315
Run! Run!

1952
02:51:00,683 --> 02:51:02,318
Come on, Uncle Dan.

1953
02:51:02,351 --> 02:51:03,486
Get out of there.

1954
02:51:04,920 --> 02:51:06,022
Come on.

1955
02:51:17,766 --> 02:51:20,036
The fire spread fast,

1956
02:51:20,069 --> 02:51:22,038
destroying the hotel.

1957
02:51:22,071 --> 02:51:23,640
Purifying it.

1958
02:51:25,074 --> 02:51:27,076
I could almost hear it...

1959
02:51:27,109 --> 02:51:28,011
screaming.

1960
02:51:29,611 --> 02:51:32,348
I could hear it dying.

1961
02:51:32,381 --> 02:51:34,917
And deep inside, I knew...

1962
02:51:37,786 --> 02:51:39,422
I knew you were okay.

1963
02:51:40,989 --> 02:51:42,859
I'm sorry I put you in danger.

1964
02:51:44,026 --> 02:51:45,428
It was the only way.

1965
02:51:46,495 --> 02:51:47,730
I know.

1966
02:51:48,831 --> 02:51:51,967
Do you think she was right

1967
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,037
when she said
she wasn't the last one?

1968
02:51:55,404 --> 02:51:56,806
The world's a hungry place.

1969
02:51:57,673 --> 02:52:00,343
A dark place.

1970
02:52:00,376 --> 02:52:03,946
Maybe there's more of them
or things like them or worse,

1971
02:52:03,979 --> 02:52:05,815
but there are more people
like you, too.

1972
02:52:06,648 --> 02:52:08,384
People who stand.

1973
02:52:11,854 --> 02:52:13,723
I told you
when I first met you,

1974
02:52:13,756 --> 02:52:16,392
I told you that
you should hide.

1975
02:52:17,793 --> 02:52:19,796
That you should
keep your head down.

1976
02:52:20,896 --> 02:52:22,832
Keep your shine out of sight.

1977
02:52:24,900 --> 02:52:26,336
But I was wrong.

1978
02:52:29,571 --> 02:52:31,341
Shine on, Abra Stone.

1979
02:52:34,443 --> 02:52:36,679
You shine on.

1980
02:52:38,614 --> 02:52:40,550
Dinner's ready.

1981
02:52:43,685 --> 02:52:44,887
Who are you talking to?

1982
02:52:47,423 --> 02:52:48,858
No one.

1983
02:52:48,891 --> 02:52:49,992
Hmm.

1984
02:52:56,732 --> 02:52:57,967
That's not true.

1985
02:53:02,104 --> 02:53:03,606
I was talking to Dan.

1986
02:53:11,480 --> 02:53:13,616
We go on after.

1987
02:53:14,516 --> 02:53:16,185
We go on.

1988
02:53:16,218 --> 02:53:17,620
And he's okay.

1989
02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:19,922
So is Daddy.

1990
02:53:21,123 --> 02:53:22,592
He really is.

1991
02:53:26,595 --> 02:53:27,864
Good.

1992
02:53:39,475 --> 02:53:40,843
You coming, sweetheart?

1993
02:53:43,512 --> 02:53:44,947

Dan Torrance made one stop
as soon as he got here.

1942
02:47:55,564 --> 02:47:57,200
To the boiler room.

1943
02:48:21,790 --> 02:48:24,227
There you are.

1944
02:48:25,561 --> 02:48:27,163
You were supposed to run.

1945
02:48:27,196 --> 02:48:28,865
I didn't wanna leave you.

1946
02:48:31,800 --> 02:48:33,670
I'm exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

1947
02:48:35,604 --> 02:48:38,341
I can't hold it off for much
longer. Abra, you need to run.

1948
02:48:38,374 --> 02:48:39,609
No.

1949
02:48:39,642 --> 02:48:41,244
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

1950
02:48:41,277 --> 02:48:43,613
I have to close the door
behind us, right?

1951
02:48:44,647 --> 02:48:46,315
Run! Run!

1952
02:51:00,683 --> 02:51:02,318
Come on, Uncle Dan.

1953
02:51:02,351 --> 02:51:03,486
Get out of there.

1954
02:51:04,920 --> 02:51:06,022
Come on.

1955
02:51:17,766 --> 02:51:20,036
The fire spread fast,

1956
02:51:20,069 --> 02:51:22,038
destroying the hotel.

1957
02:51:22,071 --> 02:51:23,640
Purifying it.

1958
02:51:25,074 --> 02:51:27,076
I could almost hear it...

1959
02:51:27,109 --> 02:51:28,011
screaming.

1960
02:51:29,611 --> 02:51:32,348
I could hear it dying.

1961
02:51:32,381 --> 02:51:34,917
And deep inside, I knew...

1962
02:51:37,786 --> 02:51:39,422
I knew you were okay.

1963
02:51:40,989 --> 02:51:42,859
I'm sorry I put you in danger.

1964
02:51:44,026 --> 02:51:45,428
It was the only way.

1965
02:51:46,495 --> 02:51:47,730
I know.

1966
02:51:48,831 --> 02:51:51,967
Do you think she was right

1967
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,037
when she said
she wasn't the last one?

1968
02:51:55,404 --> 02:51:56,806
The world's a hungry place.

1969
02:51:57,673 --> 02:52:00,343
A dark place.

1970
02:52:00,376 --> 02:52:03,946
Maybe there's more of them
or things like them or worse,

1971
02:52:03,979 --> 02:52:05,815
but there are more people
like you, too.

1972
02:52:06,648 --> 02:52:08,384
People who stand.

1973
02:52:11,854 --> 02:52:13,723
I told you
when I first met you,

1974
02:52:13,756 --> 02:52:16,392
I told you that
you should hide.

1975
02:52:17,793 --> 02:52:19,796
That you should
keep your head down.

1976
02:52:20,896 --> 02:52:22,832
Keep your shine out of sight.

1977
02:52:24,900 --> 02:52:26,336
But I was wrong.

1978
02:52:29,571 --> 02:52:31,341
Shine on, Abra Stone.

1979
02:52:34,443 --> 02:52:36,679
You shine on.

1980
02:52:38,614 --> 02:52:40,550
Dinner's ready.

1981
02:52:43,685 --> 02:52:44,887
Who are you talking to?

1982
02:52:47,423 --> 02:52:48,858
No one.

1983
02:52:48,
