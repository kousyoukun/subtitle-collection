such a funny hat. [chuckles]

It is.

some light in him, too.

Won't stop with her, either.

You said they were just pictures in
a book and they couldn't hurt me.

134
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,767
Some things,

135
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:30,772
dark things,
the shining's like food.

136
00:11:30,796 --> 00:11:33,498
They're mosquitoes
landing for blood.

137

The Overlook,

138
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:41,849
it was always
just pictures to me.

139
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:44,443
But I didn't shine like you.

140
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:48,388
Nobody shines like you.

141
00:11:48,412 --> 00:11:52,959
So, you in that damn hotel, you
was like a million-watt battery

142
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:54,728
all plugged in.

143
00:11:54,752 --> 00:11:55,863
And it ate it up.

144
00:11:55,887 --> 00:11:57,565
You made it real.

145
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:01,435
Started soon as you
walked through the door.

146
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:03,771
Can't do nothing about that,
I'm sorry to tell you,

147
00:12:03,795 --> 00:12:05,006
but you're not a child.

148
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,041
You're older now.

149
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:09,344
Much older, in a way.

150
00:12:09,368 --> 00:12:10,835
You gotta hear this.

151
00:12:11,902 --> 00:12:15,483
World's a hungry place.

152
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:19,487
And the darkest things are the
hungriest, and they'll eat what shines.

153
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:22,890
Swarm it like mosquitoes
or leeches.

154
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:24,617
Can't do nothing about that.

155
00:12:27,051 --> 00:12:29,830
What you can do...

156
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:33,392
is turn what they come for
against 'em.

157
00:12:37,396 --> 00:12:38,863
My grandfather,

158
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:42,535
he was a mean son of a bitch.

159
00:12:44,402 --> 00:12:45,747
Dark inside.

160
00:12:45,771 --> 00:12:48,516
Same type of dark as your dad.

161
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,017
Beat me senseless,
and my grandma, too,

162
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,720
and when he died, I danced.

163
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:56,481
But he kept on coming back.

164
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,826
Standing in my room.

165
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,530
Suit all gray and stinkin'

166
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:05,358
from whatever mold was
growin' on him in that box.

167
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:11,097
One day, he grabbed me,
and he was real.

168
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,474
His nails were long

169
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:15,877
from growing in the grave,

170
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:18,679

you got bit by a snake.

333
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,862
A snake in a white blouse

334
00:25:49,886 --> 00:25:51,690
whose face is a blank.

335
00:26:01,565 --> 00:26:03,634
- That is interesting.
- Mm-hmm.

336
00:26:12,977 --> 00:26:15,289
Excuse me, miss?

337
00:26:15,313 --> 00:26:17,791
Miss. Miss, you left something
in the theater.

338
00:26:17,815 --> 00:26:19,151
You wanna leave me alone.

339
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,860
Well, hi there.

340
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,562
You wanna let me go.

341
00:26:33,264 --> 00:26:35,567
Oh, no, sweetie.

342
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:38,435
No, I don't.

How far can I get for this?

348
00:28:03,953 --> 00:28:07,533
[man] Four of spades.
What color is this?

349
00:28:07,557 --> 00:28:10,503
Mommy, I made this for you.
It's a secret card.

350
00:28:10,527 --> 00:28:12,371
[Lucy gasps] Mm,
thank you, Abba-doo.

351
00:28:12,395 --> 00:28:15,074
Does anyone know a magic word?

352
00:28:15,098 --> 00:28:18,845
- [kids] Ooh, ooh.
- Uh... You.

353
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:20,513
Abracadabra.

354
00:28:20,537 --> 00:28:21,915
Abracadabra.
That's a great one.

355
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:24,276
Okay, you hold the magic wand.

356
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:27,420
Now, everyone,

357
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:30,389
on the count of three, okay?

358
00:28:30,413 --> 00:28:33,327
- One, two, three.
- [kids] Two, three.

359
00:28:33,351 --> 00:28:36,797
Abracadabra.

360
00:28:36,821 --> 00:28:38,831
I know magic, too.

361
00:28:38,855 --> 00:28:43,002
Well, then you get to hold him,
birthday girl.

362
00:28:43,026 --> 00:28:46,439
- There you go. You got him?
- [David] Oh.

363
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:49,108
For my next trick...
Oh, my goodness. Sorry.

364
00:28:49,132 --> 00:28:51,544
- Sometimes, if I...
- [kids exclaim and laugh]

365
00:28:51,568 --> 00:28:54,080
- Sorry.
- [kid jeering]

366
00:28:54,104 --> 00:28:56,515
Has anyone seen my spoons?

367
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:58,351
I can do that.

368
00:28:58,375 --> 00:28:59,919
That's nice, sweetie.

369
00:28:59,943 --> 00:29:01,454
- [girl] They're on you!
- [magician] Oh, they're on me?

370
00:29:01,478 --> 00:29:02,755
Okay, make sure you guys
don't do this.

371
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:04,915
- [inhales sharply] Oh!
- [kids exclaim]

372
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:17,537
Uh... We can forget
about naptime.

373
00:29:17,561 --> 00:29:19,364
- Just a few more hours.
- Mm.

374
00:29:21,132 --> 00:29:22,743
[sighs heavily]

375
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:25,445
Say it with me.
"Just a few more hours."

376
00:29:25,469 --> 00:29:27,037
Just a few more hours.

377
00:29:33,411 --> 00:29:34,778
[David] What the hell?

378
00:29:43,687 --> 00:29:45,023
Dave...

379
00:29:58,001 --> 00:29:59,636
[young Abra] Abracadabra.

Oops.

385
00:30:40,744 --> 00:30:42,789
Well, hi there, sleepyhead.

386
00:30:42,813 --> 00:30:44,491
Sorry.

387
00:30:44,515 --> 00:30:46,859
I had to sleep you pretty hard.

388
00:30:46,883 --> 00:30:48,861
You're a tough one.

389
00:30:48,885 --> 00:30:50,496
Willful.

390
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,131
You know, I checked.

391
00:30:52,155 --> 00:30:54,667
Six men in three months

392
00:30:54,691 --> 00:30:58,070
with those little snakebite
tattoos on their cheeks.

393
00:30:58,094 --> 00:30:59,930
Why, you've been busy.

394
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:06,213
[Rose gasps]

395
00:31:06,237 --> 00:31:10,516
Snakebite Andi,
that's who you are.

396
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,844
So, who am I?

397
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:18,058
You're some crazy bitch
who kidnapped me.

398
00:31:18,082 --> 00:31:19,792
Just the truth from now on.

399
00:31:19,816 --> 00:31:21,920
You will only speak the truth.

400
00:31:24,721 --> 00:31:27,766
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

401
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:31,804
[laughs] My God. Works a little
too well, don't it?

402
00:31:31,828 --> 00:31:34,808
Here's the deal,
Snakebite Andi.

403
00:31:34,832 --> 00:31:38,544
You're a pusher, hmm?
You can push people.

404
00:31:38,568 --> 00:31:40,880
We haven't had a pusher
around here for a little while,

405
00:31:40,904 --> 00:31:45,709
so I'm gonna offer you a deal I haven't
offered anyone in almost 40 years.

406
00:31:47,277 --> 00:31:49,480
How old are you, darlin'?

407
00:31:50,948 --> 00:31:52,291
Fifteen.

408
00:31:52,315 --> 00:31:54,093
Fifteen?

409
00:31:54,117 --> 00:31:57,297
Oh, God, what an age.

410
00:31:57,321 --> 00:32:00,567
Springtime of your womanhood,
isn't it?

411
00:32:00,591 --> 00:32:03,570
Mm. You're not a girl anymore,

412
00:32:03,594 --> 00:32:07,273
but you don't have
a single dent yet either.

413
00:32:07,297 --> 00:32:09,834
Gravity hasn't even
noticed you.

414
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:12,003
Not at 15.

415
00:32:13,703 --> 00:32:14,838
Men, though...

416
00:32:16,273 --> 00:32:17,775
No, no, no. No shame.

417
00:32:19,209 --> 00:32:23,822
You paid that back, didn't you?

418
00:32:23,846 --> 00:32:27,293
That's what I'm offering you.
Springtime forever.

419
00:32:27,317 --> 00:32:29,729
Ten years from now,
you're still 15.

420
00:32:29,753 --> 00:32:32,023
A hundred, maybe 17.

421
00:32:33,856 --> 00:32:35,135
Eat well,

422
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:38,963
stay young, live long.

423
00:32:41,864 --> 00:32:44,043
So, you and your friend...

424
00:32:44,067 --> 00:32:47,179
Mm, not my friend.
That's my family.

425
00:32:47,203 --> 00:32:49,640
We're the True Knot, dear.

426
00:32:51,874 --> 00:32:53,919
The True Knot.

427
00:32:53,943 --> 00:32:58,081
What's tied
can never be untied.

428
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:12,989
[man] You like it?

429
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,268
Oh. Sorry. I was just...

430
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:18,672
That's okay.
People love to look at it.

431
00:34:18,696 --> 00:34:20,674
We used to set this up
in the library.

432
00:34:20,698 --> 00:34:23,942
Community project,
just taking a life all its own.

433
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:25,944
See, we started with
the clock tower there.

434
00:34:25,968 --> 00:34:28,681
- [Dan] Oh, yeah.
- [man] Just keeps growing.

435
00:34:28,705 --> 00:34:30,116
Kids call it Teenytown.

436
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,418
The kids build this?

437
00:34:31,442 --> 00:34:33,186
With some help, oh, yeah.

438
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,947
Keep it up,
build the whole town square.

439
00:34:37,948 --> 00:34:42,061
Are you off the bus
or riding your thumb?

440
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:43,395
Yeah, the bus.

441
00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:46,032
Oh. Not many ride the bus
this far north.

442
00:34:46,056 --> 00:34:48,960
Unless they're looking
for work. [sniffs]

443
00:34:51,462 --> 00:34:52,997
Yeah.

444
00:34:54,131 --> 00:34:55,974
Change of scenery,

445
00:34:55,998 --> 00:34:58,669
or you running away
from something?

446
00:35:00,203 --> 00:35:01,980
Oh, don't mind me.
I hope I'm...

447
00:35:02,004 --> 00:35:03,183
New face is all.

448
00:35:03,207 --> 00:35:04,817
Yeah.

449
00:35:04,841 --> 00:35:07,377
Guess I'm running away
from myself, I guess.

450
00:35:08,312 --> 00:35:10,489
Oh, yeah.

451
00:35:10,513 --> 00:35:15,962
I know that look.
Too well, I'm sorry to say.

452
00:35:15,986 --> 00:35:19,833
Running away from yourself.
That is a pickle.

453
00:35:19,857 --> 00:35:22,435
[sighs] You take yourself
with you wherever you go.

454
00:35:22,459 --> 00:35:26,406
- Ain't that the bitch?
- [chuckles] Mm-hmm.

No pets, no parties, no noise.

Last guy said the same.
Math student.

461
00:35:43,312 --> 00:35:45,190
Even let him paint the wall
all blackboard,

462
00:35:45,214 --> 00:35:48,228
so he could scribble
his little puzzles up there.

463
00:35:48,252 --> 00:35:51,130
Wasn't quiet. No, sir.

464
00:35:51,154 --> 00:35:54,400
Didn't even paint over this when he
left, but I'm glad he didn't,

465
00:35:54,424 --> 00:35:57,003
'cause I can make this

Pretty sure.

It's your ass, Billy.

00:36:08,138 --> 00:36:10,107
Bleedin' heart, this one.

I'm downstairs, ground floor,

Find me tomorrow,

Why are you doing this?

474

You don't know me.

00:36:23,953 --> 00:36:25,931
No, I don't.

476
00:36:25,955 --> 00:36:28,835
But I know the look,
like I said.

477
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:32,272
And sometimes I get this
feeling about people.

- Hard to understand, I guess.
- Mm.

00:36:35,232 --> 00:36:37,067
Easier than you think.

01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:43,487
Any luck?

824
01:00:43,511 --> 01:00:45,556
- Gettin' closer.
- Hmm.

825
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:48,493
He's somewhere in Iowa,
I think.

826
01:00:48,517 --> 01:00:52,254
We'll all take a nice long road
trip once I'm sure I've found him.

827
01:00:55,056 --> 01:00:57,335
Until I do, we...

828
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,904
You gotta open a canister,
Rosie.

829
01:00:59,928 --> 01:01:03,907
We took steam six months ago,
Crow. Six months is nothing.

830
01:01:03,931 --> 01:01:08,012
That kid in Delaware wasn't so
steamy and it's already showing.

831
01:01:08,036 --> 01:01:09,813
You see Grampa Flick's hair,
yeah?

832
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:11,282
[Rose] Yeah.

833
01:01:11,306 --> 01:01:12,851
- I don't think he's well.
- [chuckles]

834
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:15,587
Grampa Flick hasn't been well
since Nixon was in office.

835
01:01:15,611 --> 01:01:17,855
I know.

836
01:01:17,879 --> 01:01:20,782
But we need to eat.
All of us.

837
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:24,295
Are the canisters low?

838
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:25,864
'Course not.

839
01:01:25,888 --> 01:01:28,958
Just no need to waste one
if you're close to the kill.

840
01:01:30,759 --> 01:01:32,337
- Rosie.
- Mm-hmm?

841
01:01:32,361 --> 01:01:34,797
I might need it
just to find him.

842
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,378
There used to be more steam
in the world, you know?

843
01:01:40,402 --> 01:01:41,913
Oh, don't be daft. Come on.

844
01:01:41,937 --> 01:01:43,648
That's like when rubes say,

845
01:01:43,672 --> 01:01:45,983
"50 years ago, people used
to be more neighborly."

846
01:01:46,007 --> 01:01:47,719
But it's true, Rosie.

847
01:01:47,743 --> 01:01:49,853
There's less steam out there,
and it's weaker, too.

848
01:01:49,877 --> 01:01:51,656
I don't know if
it's their cell phones or diets

849
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,357
or their Netflix or what,

850
01:01:53,381 --> 01:01:55,460
but I am not picking up
many scents these days,

851
01:01:55,484 --> 01:01:56,994
and the ones that I do, Rosie,
are just not that...

852
01:01:57,018 --> 01:01:59,431
I'll open a canister tonight
to tide everyone over.

853
01:01:59,455 --> 01:02:00,690
Thank you.

854
01:02:06,962 --> 01:02:09,440
- You know it, Rosie.
- I know what?

855
01:02:09,464 --> 01:02:11,476
It's why you're up here
every day.

856
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,100
It's why you're always up here no
matter what you tell the others.

857
01:02:14,502 --> 01:02:15,813
The world's not as steamy

858
01:02:15,837 --> 01:02:17,939
and you are looking
for a whale.

That kid is a natural.

He hits the ball every time.

She was out of there so fast.

965

But I swear, Crow Daddy,

966
01:11:17,946 --> 01:11:21,459

freak out,

send her to a psychiatrist.

You know, they get her on
pills, could ruin the steam.

Might muffle her just...

No, giving Paxil to this kid,

it's like throwing a piece of
Saran Wrap over a searchlight.

but when she comes back,
and she'll be back,

01:11:52,147 --> 01:11:54,250
oh, I'll be ready, honey.

980
01:11:56,651 --> 01:11:58,319
I'll be ready.

I made a new friend.

His name's Dan.

986
01:13:08,723 --> 01:13:10,658
Yeah? At school?

987
01:13:11,626 --> 01:13:13,737
No. He doesn't live here.

01:13:13,761 --> 01:13:15,638
I mean, he lives close.

989
01:13:15,662 --> 01:13:17,107
Frazier, I think.

990
01:13:17,131 --> 01:13:18,541
No big deal.

01:13:18,565 --> 01:13:20,678
Abs, are you okay?

992
01:13:20,702 --> 01:13:22,146
Last night, I...

993
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:24,181
I'm okay.

994
01:13:24,205 --> 01:13:25,715
Sorry about that.

995
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:29,020
I know that head of yours
is like a radio sometimes.

996
01:13:29,044 --> 01:13:33,057
And you pick up
some weird stations.

997
01:13:33,081 --> 01:13:34,116
Nothing weird like that.

998
01:13:35,183 --> 01:13:36,585
Not anymore.

Good. Yeah, going good.

Yeah, she found me again.

- How?
- I don't know.

We have to.

Does she know who you are?
Where we are?

No, I don't know. I don't think...
That's not the important... Look.

- I said she's huge steam, right?
- Mm-hmm.

Yeah, it's even bigger
than that.

1069
01:20:48,916 --> 01:20:50,593
I tried to turn around in her

1070
01:20:50,617 --> 01:20:53,696
and she blew me out of her
like I was nothing.

1071
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:56,599
- Bullshit.
- No. Never happened to me, ever.

I would have said
that was impossible.

Is she food
or do we turn her?

We don't turn her.

Rosie, are you sure?

1076
01:21:06,501 --> 01:21:07,977
If she's what you say she is,
then...

1077
01:21:08,001 --> 01:21:11,013
Then we don't want anyone
with that power in the Knot.

1078

Jeez. Think about it.

What do you mean?

1081
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:26,029
I mean, we don't kill her.

1082
01:21:26,053 --> 01:21:27,823
And we don't turn her.

1083
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:30,868
Think of a cow.

1084

You butcher one, that gives you
meat for a month.

1085
01:21:34,961 --> 01:21:36,764
Keep it alive,

1086
01:21:37,697 --> 01:21:39,910
take care of it,

1087
01:21:39,934 --> 01:21:42,779
it gives you milk for years.

1088
01:21:42,803 --> 01:21:44,882
- Rosie, we've never tried that.
- I know.

1089
01:21:44,906 --> 01:21:46,883
Because a steam head is
dangerous.

1090
01:21:46,907 --> 01:21:48,584
You keep it alive,
it could be dangerous.

1091
01:21:48,608 --> 01:21:51,154
I know. The point... [chuckles]

1092
01:21:51,178 --> 01:21:53,757
The point, Crow,

1093
01:21:53,781 --> 01:21:55,951
is she's the great white whale.

1094
01:21:56,951 --> 01:21:58,553
And I want her.

1095
01:22:00,254 --> 01:22:01,823
I want her.

1096
01:22:03,224 --> 01:22:05,227
I fucking want her.

Let's use our outside voices,
all right?

1106
01:24:23,029 --> 01:24:24,807
You tracked me down?

1107
01:24:24,831 --> 01:24:29,413
It was easier than I thought.
Like GPS, but in my head.

1108
01:24:29,437 --> 01:24:34,718
Look, I don't mean any offense,
but this day and age, a grown man

sitting with a teenage girl
on a park bench...

1110
01:24:36,711 --> 01:24:39,388
I'm Abra Stone. And if anyone
asks, you're my uncle.

Uncle Dan.

1112
01:24:43,416 --> 01:24:46,896
And that's not even a lie.
Not totally.

1113
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,031
We're related in other ways.

1114
01:24:49,055 --> 01:24:50,892
You're magic, like me.

1115
01:24:52,425 --> 01:24:54,294
I don't know about magic.

1116
01:24:55,328 --> 01:24:56,906
I...

1117
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:58,441
I always called it the shining.

1118
01:24:58,465 --> 01:25:00,334
And, yeah, we both shine.

1119
01:25:01,402 --> 01:25:02,978
Do your parents know?

1120
01:25:03,002 --> 01:25:04,706
About my shine?

1121
01:25:06,172 --> 01:25:07,483
They're scared of it,

1122
01:25:07,507 --> 01:25:10,087
but they think it's gone
except for a few things.

1123
01:25:10,111 --> 01:25:13,490
Like, my mom sometimes asks me to
help her find something she's lost.

1124
01:25:13,514 --> 01:25:15,392
Last month,
it was her car keys.

1125
01:25:15,416 --> 01:25:18,227
She left them on my dad's
worktable in the garage.

1126
01:25:18,251 --> 01:25:20,996
But they don't talk about it.

1127
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:24,166
Or if I use it,
they look at me different.

1128
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:25,901
Or not at all.

1129
01:25:25,925 --> 01:25:28,370
Not for a whole day once.

1130
01:25:28,394 --> 01:25:30,264
Wouldn't look me in the eyes.

1131
01:25:32,433 --> 01:25:34,745
So, I try not to use it.

1132
01:25:34,769 --> 01:25:36,879
Because if people find out,

1133
01:25:36,903 --> 01:25:38,339
"Eek, a freak." You know?

1134
01:25:40,273 --> 01:25:42,052
Sure you know.

1135
01:25:42,076 --> 01:25:44,011
You try not to use it, too.

1136
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:49,125
You've been trying a long time,

1137
01:25:49,149 --> 01:25:52,386
and she couldn't look you
in your eyes either.

1138
01:25:56,523 --> 01:25:58,134
When I was a kid, I didn't

1139
01:25:58,158 --> 01:26:01,004
understand the shining.
I called it "Tony."

1140
01:26:01,028 --> 01:26:03,339
I thought he was
my imaginary friend.

1141
01:26:03,363 --> 01:26:06,409
I thought you were
my imaginary friend...

1142
01:26:06,433 --> 01:26:08,502
for a long time.

1143
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:13,316
How many of us are out there?

1144
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:15,317
There's a lot of people
who have a little bit of shine,

1145
01:26:15,341 --> 01:26:16,953
they don't even know it.

1146
01:26:16,977 --> 01:26:18,288
They always seem to come home

1147
01:26:18,312 --> 01:26:20,123
with flowers
when their wives are sad,

1148
01:26:20,147 --> 01:26:22,424
or they do well on the school
test they didn't study for.

1149
01:26:22,448 --> 01:26:24,294
But I only met
two or three people

1150
01:26:24,318 --> 01:26:26,521
in my whole life
who knew they shined.

1151
01:26:29,122 --> 01:26:31,233
The baseball boy shined.

1152
01:26:31,257 --> 01:26:33,161
His name was Bradley Trevor.

1153
01:26:36,330 --> 01:26:38,474
These people...

1154
01:26:38,498 --> 01:26:41,301
they look like people anyway,
they took him.

1155
01:26:42,368 --> 01:26:44,371
And they ate him.

1156
01:26:45,505 --> 01:26:47,374
They ate his shine.

1157
01:26:48,274 --> 01:26:50,853
You could feel it?

1158
01:26:50,877 --> 01:26:53,289
And they could feel me,
I think.

1159
01:26:53,313 --> 01:26:55,849
At least one of them did.
A lady.

1160
01:26:57,283 --> 01:26:58,952
The lady with the hat.

1161
01:27:00,287 --> 01:27:03,465
I wanna find them, stop them,

1162
01:27:03,489 --> 01:27:07,504
because I think they've done
this to a lot of other kids, too.

1163
01:27:07,528 --> 01:27:09,964
So, I have to do something,
right?

1164
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:13,108
Why did you come here?

1165
01:27:13,132 --> 01:27:14,544
Why me?

1166
01:27:14,568 --> 01:27:16,279
Because you can hear me.

1167
01:27:16,303 --> 01:27:19,048
You'd believe me.
You shine, too.

1168
01:27:19,072 --> 01:27:20,874
And they hurt people like us.

1169
01:27:23,109 --> 01:27:24,545
I mean, what would you do?

1170
01:27:28,014 --> 01:27:29,226
If you could get
something of his,

1171
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:30,560
if you could go to Iowa...

1172
01:27:30,584 --> 01:27:32,361
- Whoa, hang on.
- I can help you find him.

1173
01:27:32,385 --> 01:27:34,196
Then his parents would know
where he was.

1174
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:36,199
They could bury him right,
at least.

1175
01:27:36,223 --> 01:27:38,334
We could also get his glove.

1176
01:27:38,358 --> 01:27:40,102
If I can touch that glove,
I can track them.

1177
01:27:40,126 --> 01:27:41,538
Easy. Easy.

I think that was his name,

1180

Don't chase these people.

Don't aggravate them.

And whatever you do,
don't attract their attention.

1187
01:28:14,495 --> 01:28:16,306
Don't shine.

1188
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:18,040
Find something, anything...

1189
01:28:18,064 --> 01:28:21,977
Well, almost anything,
to stop that shine of yours.

01:35:25,492 --> 01:35:28,036
Let them burrow.

1308
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:31,765
A hundred worms about
her dear friends, the Knot.

1309
01:35:33,099 --> 01:35:35,544
And when we roll up,

1310
01:35:35,568 --> 01:35:39,572
she'll be so happy to see us,
she'll just hop right in the van.

1311
01:35:43,844 --> 01:35:46,088
- If she did this...
- Mm-hmm?

1312
01:35:46,112 --> 01:35:48,790
...really shook a whole street,

1313
01:35:48,814 --> 01:35:51,093
I think you should be careful.

1314
01:35:51,117 --> 01:35:52,819
She's a little girl.

1315
01:35:55,087 --> 01:35:56,756
[both chuckle]

1316
01:35:58,524 --> 01:36:00,902
And you are the queen bitch
of all time.

1317
01:36:00,926 --> 01:36:02,804
- Mm.
- I know.

1318
01:36:02,828 --> 01:36:05,040
Just saying.

1319
01:36:05,064 --> 01:36:07,401
- Be careful.
- Mm.

1320
01:36:20,147 --> 01:36:21,582
[inhales]

Mm.

- [music playing on headphones]

1324
01:36:31,892 --> 01:36:32,834
Hey.

1325
01:36:32,858 --> 01:36:33,835
Hey, Mom.

1326
01:36:33,859 --> 01:36:35,071
You feeling okay?

1327
01:36:35,095 --> 01:36:36,597
We missed you at dinner.

1328
01:36:37,531 --> 01:36:40,134
I'm okay. Just had a rough day.

1329
01:36:44,938 --> 01:36:47,717
I'm flying out to see Momo
in the morning.

1330
01:36:47,741 --> 01:36:49,143
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1331
01:36:51,577 --> 01:36:52,812
Abs, is she...

1332
01:36:56,849 --> 01:36:58,486
Is she gonna
pull through this time?

1333
01:37:03,023 --> 01:37:04,024
I don't know.

1334
01:37:05,692 --> 01:37:06,794
I hope so.

1335
01:37:07,928 --> 01:37:09,397
Tell her I love her.

1336
01:37:13,132 --> 01:37:14,734
[crickets chirping]

1337

01:39:52,626 --> 01:39:54,828
Keep sleeping, princess.

1341
01:40:08,642 --> 01:40:11,754
You rubes. [scoffs]

1342
01:40:11,778 --> 01:40:15,156
Spend your whole lives
making little boxes,

1343
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:17,994
little memories.

1344
01:40:18,018 --> 01:40:21,097
Oh, you think
they make you so rich.

1345
01:40:21,121 --> 01:40:23,157
You should see mine, kiddo.

1346
01:40:24,357 --> 01:40:27,595
Oh, my mind's a cathedral.

1347
01:40:31,665 --> 01:40:34,134
Well, hi there.

1348
01:40:41,875 --> 01:40:42,875
Hmm.

[groaning]

He said you'd come back.

1351
01:41:01,394 --> 01:41:02,405
And you did.

1352
01:41:02,429 --> 01:41:04,406
[continues groaning]

1353
01:41:04,430 --> 01:41:05,874
Good.

1354

[Rose panting] No!

1355
01:41:08,167 --> 01:41:11,446
Get back! Get back!

a fucking child!

Where are you?

1360
01:41:21,147 --> 01:41:23,392
Where? Where did you...?
Where...?

1361
01:41:23,416 --> 01:41:25,352
What did you...?
Where did you...?

1362
01:41:27,086 --> 01:41:28,086
No.

1363
01:41:30,223 --> 01:41:32,034

Rose?

1372
01:42:20,072 --> 01:42:21,450
Trap.

1373
01:42:21,474 --> 01:42:23,119
Trap.

1374
01:42:23,143 --> 01:42:25,053
- [Rose groans]
- [Andi] What the hell happened?

1375
01:42:25,077 --> 01:42:27,388
- Little bitch set a trap for me.
- Oh, my God. Your hand.

1376
01:42:27,412 --> 01:42:29,224
- [Crow] Rose! Rose, calm down.
- [grunts]

1377
01:42:29,248 --> 01:42:31,459
We know where she is now, right?
Now we know.

1378
01:42:31,483 --> 01:42:32,995
She was in my head!

1379
01:42:33,019 --> 01:42:34,429
- What?
- [Rose] Stealing!

1380
01:42:34,453 --> 01:42:35,530
What does she know?

1381
01:42:35,554 --> 01:42:37,133
I don't know. I don't know.

1382
01:42:37,157 --> 01:42:39,435
- How much does she...
- [Rose] I don't know!

1383
01:42:39,459 --> 01:42:42,004
- [groans] I don't know...
- There's a problem.

1384
01:42:42,028 --> 01:42:43,004
Not now!

1385
01:42:43,028 --> 01:42:44,098
Grampa Flick...

1386
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:46,899
I think he's cycling.

[whimpers]

1388
01:42:52,304 --> 01:42:55,183
[Abra] <i>Uncle Dan! Uncle Dan,
I hurt her.</i>

1389
01:42:55,207 --> 01:42:56,218
<i>I really hurt her.</i>

1390
01:42:56,242 --> 01:42:57,986
I hurt her and she deserved it

1391
01:42:58,010 --> 01:43:00,088
and that's not the best part.
The best part is...

1392
01:43:00,112 --> 01:43:03,191
<i>The best part is I got in her head.
I got in her head.</i>

- <i>Uncle Dan? Are you there?</i>
- Oh, God, Abra.

[Abra] <i>Can you hear me?</i>

1395

What have you done?

1396
01:43:09,087 --> 01:43:10,256
[sighs]

1397
01:43:24,037 --> 01:43:26,581
Just talk to the kid.

1398
01:43:26,605 --> 01:43:29,108
If we're gonna do this,
then let's do this.

1399
01:43:32,412 --> 01:43:33,514
<i>Hi, Abra.</i>

1400
01:43:37,483 --> 01:43:38,986
I can hear you.

1401
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:42,055
[wheezing]

1402
01:43:43,255 --> 01:43:45,233
I don't understand.

1403
01:43:45,257 --> 01:43:46,359
[Rose] You will.

1404
01:43:48,228 --> 01:43:51,206
I thought we lived forever.

1405
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:53,942
Did someone promise you that,
Andi?

1406
01:43:53,966 --> 01:43:56,269
Did someone say
you're immortal?

1407
01:43:57,437 --> 01:44:02,383
I said, "Live long, eat well."

1408
01:44:02,407 --> 01:44:04,386
We can live long, very long.

1409
01:44:04,410 --> 01:44:05,521
And we do,

1410
01:44:05,545 --> 01:44:07,322
most of us.

1411
01:44:07,346 --> 01:44:09,315
But we haven't been
eating well.

1412
01:44:10,550 --> 01:44:12,820
Not for a long time.

1413
01:44:13,653 --> 01:44:14,955
Rosie, he's going.

1414
01:44:16,589 --> 01:44:17,890
[weakly] Rosie.

1415
01:44:23,662 --> 01:44:25,131
Yes, love?

1416
01:44:26,398 --> 01:44:28,177
I'm scared.

1417
01:44:28,201 --> 01:44:31,246
No, you're not. [sniffs]

1418
01:44:31,270 --> 01:44:36,352
You watched empires rise and
fall. [sniffling]

1419
01:44:36,376 --> 01:44:39,154
Cheered the gladiators in Rome.

1420
01:44:39,178 --> 01:44:41,190
Sailed across oceans,

1421
01:44:41,214 --> 01:44:43,424
to new worlds,

1422
01:44:43,448 --> 01:44:49,565
while you fed on kings,
and princes, and popes.

1423
01:44:49,589 --> 01:44:52,267
They wrote myths of you,

1424
01:44:52,291 --> 01:44:54,602
and made statues,

1425
01:44:54,626 --> 01:44:59,441
and they trembled
in their villages, and beds,

1426
01:44:59,465 --> 01:45:01,635
and skyscrapers.

1427
01:45:03,236 --> 01:45:05,647
- So, no...
- [gasps]

1428
01:45:05,671 --> 01:45:08,308
...you're not scared.

1429
01:45:10,209 --> 01:45:11,612
You're a king...

1430
01:45:13,112 --> 01:45:15,315
and you eat fear.

1431
01:45:19,085 --> 01:45:20,621
[labored breathing]

1432
01:45:24,256 --> 01:45:26,502
[gasping violently]

1433
01:45:26,526 --> 01:45:28,495
[growling and gasping]

1435
01:45:45,010 --> 01:45:46,612
[cries out]

1436

[all inhaling]

01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:03,562
[knocks]

1438
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:08,576
Hey, bro.

1439
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:09,745
You know, it's 4:00 a.m.

1440
01:46:09,769 --> 01:46:11,981
You've always seen me, Billy.

1441
01:46:12,005 --> 01:46:14,574
You have a good sense about
people, is that fair to say?

1442
01:46:15,407 --> 01:46:16,718
Yeah, what...

1443
01:46:16,742 --> 01:46:18,987
You think I'm an honest man?
A good man?

1444
01:46:19,011 --> 01:46:20,289
I do, I do. Dan, I...

1445
01:46:20,313 --> 01:46:22,090
I need your help.

1446
01:46:22,114 --> 01:46:23,659
The first thing I need is for
you to listen to a story

1447
01:46:23,683 --> 01:46:26,386
and try harder than you've ever
tried to believe me.

1448
01:46:43,435 --> 01:46:44,571
[Abra] How's it going?

1449
01:46:45,772 --> 01:46:47,249
Oh, hey.

1450
01:46:47,273 --> 01:46:48,517
Shouldn't you be
getting ready for school?

1451
01:46:48,541 --> 01:46:51,352
Yeah, but I wanted
to tag along.

1452
01:46:51,376 --> 01:46:52,620
How long have you been driving?

1453
01:46:52,644 --> 01:46:54,389
A few hours or so.

1454
01:46:54,413 --> 01:46:56,148
We should get there tonight.
Late.

1455
01:46:58,584 --> 01:47:00,329
Who's that?

1456
01:47:00,353 --> 01:47:01,688
He's my friend.

1457
01:47:02,654 --> 01:47:04,291
Maybe my best friend.

1458
01:47:05,657 --> 01:47:07,636
You should've seen her face.

1459
01:47:07,660 --> 01:47:09,705
She was scared, Uncle Dan.

1460
01:47:09,729 --> 01:47:11,606
Scared like all those kids
were scared.

1461
01:47:11,630 --> 01:47:13,409
All those kids she's killed.

1462
01:47:13,433 --> 01:47:16,512
She was so mad
and so scared that I got in.

1463
01:47:16,536 --> 01:47:18,112
That was a new trick.

1464
01:47:18,136 --> 01:47:19,647
I've never done that before.

1465
01:47:19,671 --> 01:47:21,607
Yeah, me neither.
What was it like?

1466
01:47:22,474 --> 01:47:24,053
Like a library.

1467
01:47:24,077 --> 01:47:26,313
I guess
we're all libraries inside.

1468
01:47:27,246 --> 01:47:28,690
How'd you do it?

1469
01:47:28,714 --> 01:47:31,093
Like this. Just a little push.

1470
01:47:31,117 --> 01:47:32,117
[tires screech]

1471
01:47:36,288 --> 01:47:37,732
Abra!

1472
01:47:37,756 --> 01:47:39,593
- Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry!
- [Billy grunts]

1473
01:47:44,529 --> 01:47:46,209
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
- It's okay.

1474
01:47:47,666 --> 01:47:49,611
What were all those boxes?

1475
01:47:49,635 --> 01:47:50,745
Nothing.

1476
01:47:50,769 --> 01:47:52,138
Liar.

1477
01:47:55,241 --> 01:47:57,518
When I was a kid,

1478
01:47:57,542 --> 01:48:00,621
younger than you,
I bumped into something like these things

1479
01:48:00,645 --> 01:48:03,491
that ate like they do.

1480
01:48:03,515 --> 01:48:05,719
Only it wasn't a person,
it was a place.

1481
01:48:07,353 --> 01:48:12,166
They closed it down after
and let it rot.

1482
01:48:12,190 --> 01:48:14,394
But the things
that lived there, they...

1483
01:48:16,461 --> 01:48:18,507
Don't go poking around in there
again.

1484
01:48:18,531 --> 01:48:21,201
Okay, I won't. I promise.

1485
01:48:26,772 --> 01:48:28,575
[exhales heavily]

1486
01:48:34,514 --> 01:48:36,791
We're almost ready.
We're just loading up.

1487
01:48:36,815 --> 01:48:38,259
Good.

1488
01:48:38,283 --> 01:48:39,561
Get the caravan on the road

1489
01:48:39,585 --> 01:48:41,163
and we'll have her
in a day or two.

1490
01:48:41,187 --> 01:48:43,632
I don't think
you should come, Rosie.

1491
01:48:43,656 --> 01:48:46,602
[scoffs] The fuck
did you just say?

1492
01:48:46,626 --> 01:48:47,803
She tagged you.

1493
01:48:47,827 --> 01:48:49,303
She got in your head.

1494
01:48:49,327 --> 01:48:51,205
Yeah, it won't happen again.

1495
01:48:51,229 --> 01:48:53,142
And who knows how much she got
to before you kicked her out.

1496
01:48:53,166 --> 01:48:54,476
She's mine, Crow.

1497
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:55,811
Right now, as far as we know,

1498
01:48:55,835 --> 01:48:58,347
you are the only one of us
she could track.

1499
01:48:58,371 --> 01:49:00,382
Now, if she sees you coming,

1500
01:49:00,406 --> 01:49:01,682
she could run

1501
01:49:01,706 --> 01:49:03,642
or set another trap.

1502
01:49:05,243 --> 01:49:07,588
I will knock her out cold.

1503
01:49:07,612 --> 01:49:10,691
One of our assets from the NSA
gave me the good stuff.

1504
01:49:10,715 --> 01:49:13,896
Put her out without
chance of an overdose.

1505
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:16,697
I'll head south.
I'll circle around.

1506
01:49:16,721 --> 01:49:18,633
I'll come at her
from a different direction.

1507
01:49:18,657 --> 01:49:19,868
I should be there.

1508
01:49:19,892 --> 01:49:21,827
You know I'm right about this.

1509
01:49:26,299 --> 01:49:27,466
Okay.

1510
01:49:29,335 --> 01:49:31,413
I'll leave Andi here with you,
if you want.

1511
01:49:31,437 --> 01:49:34,182
No, no, you'll need your
strength, all of you.

1512
01:49:34,206 --> 01:49:36,185
If she pulls a trick on you,

1513
01:49:36,209 --> 01:49:38,253
stay together.

1514
01:49:38,277 --> 01:49:39,221
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1515
01:49:39,245 --> 01:49:40,588
[Rose] Mm-hmm.

1516
01:49:40,612 --> 01:49:42,681
But I got some tricks
of my own.

1517
01:49:48,621 --> 01:49:50,422
[Billy] Hey,
I think we're here.

1518
01:49:52,858 --> 01:49:53,858
[Dan] Okay.

1519
01:49:55,528 --> 01:49:57,164
I'll see if I can get her.

1520
01:49:58,397 --> 01:49:59,397
Abra?

1521
01:50:01,267 --> 01:50:03,978
[Abra] That's the sign.
Pull around back.

1522
01:50:04,002 --> 01:50:05,580
She says to pull around back.

1523
01:50:05,604 --> 01:50:06,714
And I'll tell you when to stop.

1524
01:50:06,738 --> 01:50:08,507
She'll tell us when to stop.

1525
01:50:14,846 --> 01:50:16,857
[Billy] I gotta tell you,
Danno,

1526
01:50:16,881 --> 01:50:19,527
I don't know whether I hope
you're right or wrong about this.

1527
01:50:19,551 --> 01:50:23,231
I mean, if you're wrong,
my friend is crazy.

1528
01:50:23,255 --> 01:50:27,002
I mean, full-blown,
mental breakdown,

1529
01:50:27,026 --> 01:50:30,771
imaginary-monsters-
killing-imaginary-kids

1530
01:50:30,795 --> 01:50:32,507
bonkers.

1531
01:50:32,531 --> 01:50:34,901
But, you know, I...
I can work with that.

1532
01:50:36,269 --> 01:50:37,545
If you're right, though...

1533
01:50:37,569 --> 01:50:39,280
[Dan] I know.

1534
01:50:39,304 --> 01:50:40,706
It's much worse.

1535
01:50:54,886 --> 01:50:56,464
You should go home.

1536
01:50:56,488 --> 01:50:58,299
What?

1537
01:50:58,323 --> 01:50:59,625
No, not you.

1538
01:51:00,693 --> 01:51:01,937
I can handle it.

1539
01:51:01,961 --> 01:51:04,631
No. We'll take it from here.

1540
01:51:07,700 --> 01:51:09,536
Okay, it's just us.

1541
01:51:26,519 --> 01:51:27,754
You smell that?

1542
01:51:30,723 --> 01:51:33,035
Used to hunt.
I ever tell you that?

1543
01:51:33,059 --> 01:51:34,468
[Dan] No.

1544
01:51:34,492 --> 01:51:35,492
Deer.

1545
01:51:35,995 --> 01:51:37,464
This one summer,

1546
01:51:38,596 --> 01:51:40,508
I clipped this buck.

1547
01:51:40,532 --> 01:51:42,878
I was tracking it for two days.

1548
01:51:42,902 --> 01:51:46,315
I got the shot, clipped him.

1549
01:51:46,339 --> 01:51:48,583
He ran off, I went after.

1550
01:51:48,607 --> 01:51:51,986
Figured he wasn't
gonna last long.

1551
01:51:52,010 --> 01:51:53,821
[panting]

1552
01:51:53,845 --> 01:51:55,490
Then he vanished.

1553
01:51:55,514 --> 01:51:58,560
Just up and evaporated.

1554
01:51:58,584 --> 01:52:01,020
Not a trace. Truly baffling.

1555
01:52:03,988 --> 01:52:05,499
Five days later,

1556
01:52:05,523 --> 01:52:08,469
I'm trying a different spot,
miles away.

1557
01:52:08,493 --> 01:52:11,598
I come around looking
for a spot for a blind...

1558
01:52:13,532 --> 01:52:14,801
then I smelled him.

1559
01:52:16,402 --> 01:52:17,703
Smelled him.

1560
01:52:18,804 --> 01:52:20,682
Found that buck

1561
01:52:20,706 --> 01:52:22,942
holed up to a hollow trunk,

1562
01:52:23,776 --> 01:52:25,478
dead for days.

1563
01:52:26,812 --> 01:52:28,381
The smell...

1564
01:52:29,648 --> 01:52:31,518
Never hunted a day since.

1565
01:52:34,987 --> 01:52:36,956
This is the same smell.

1566
01:52:42,094 --> 01:52:43,363
[Dan grunts]

1567
01:52:52,871 --> 01:52:54,373
Billy.

1568
01:53:08,754 --> 01:53:11,056
[both grunting]

1569
01:53:13,858 --> 01:53:15,060
Oh, my God!

1570
01:53:18,596 --> 01:53:19,998
[gagging]

1571
01:53:24,002 --> 01:53:25,904
[both exclaim]

1572
01:53:27,540 --> 01:53:28,975
[retching]

1573
01:53:33,077 --> 01:53:34,380

1574
01:53:36,114 --> 01:53:37,983
[Billy continues retching]

1575
01:53:39,818 --> 01:53:40,919
[coughing]

1576
01:53:41,821 --> 01:53:43,156
[groaning]

1577
01:53:48,093 --> 01:53:49,137
[Billy] Fuck.

1578
01:53:49,161 --> 01:53:51,705
Fuck, Danno. What the fuck?

1579
01:53:51,729 --> 01:53:54,476
They didn't even bury him deep.
They buried him shallow.

1580
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:55,502
I'm sorry, Billy.

1581
01:53:57,135 --> 01:53:58,804
[Billy] What did you
get us into?

1582
01:54:07,212 --> 01:54:08,789
[Billy] The people
who did that...

1583
01:54:08,813 --> 01:54:09,948
[Dan] They're not people.

1584
01:54:11,216 --> 01:54:14,062
No. No, they ain't.

1585
01:54:14,086 --> 01:54:15,822
Anyone do that to a little boy,

1586
01:54:17,156 --> 01:54:19,500
they ain't people.

1587
01:54:19,524 --> 01:54:20,735
[Abra] Did you get it?

1588
01:54:20,759 --> 01:54:21,870
Yeah, we got it.

1589
01:54:21,894 --> 01:54:23,737
Is she back?

1590
01:54:23,761 --> 01:54:25,673
We're heading back to you.
We'll be back in the morning.

1591
01:54:25,697 --> 01:54:26,799
We got a stop to make.

1592
01:54:29,201 --> 01:54:31,671
I need you to show your parents
what's happening.

1593
01:54:32,170 --> 01:54:33,882
No.

1594
01:54:33,906 --> 01:54:36,218
- Yeah.
- No. They almost think I'm normal.

1595
01:54:36,242 --> 01:54:37,852
If I tell them, they'll...

1596
01:54:37,876 --> 01:54:39,553
[Dan] Rose'll go through them
to get to you.

1597
01:54:39,577 --> 01:54:40,989
You know that, don't you?

1598
01:54:41,013 --> 01:54:42,824
She'll cut them down
without a second thought.

1599
01:54:42,848 --> 01:54:44,651
And she's coming, Abra.

1600
01:54:45,149 --> 01:54:47,019
They need to know.

1601
01:54:48,653 --> 01:54:49,955
[Abra sighs]

1602
01:54:51,756 --> 01:54:54,002
So, what's this stop
we gotta make?

1603
01:54:54,026 --> 01:54:56,162
You still got
those old deer rifles?

1604
01:55:13,778 --> 01:55:15,589
You're Uncle Dan?

1605
01:55:15,613 --> 01:55:16,958
- The fuck you think you are?
- Sir...

1606
01:55:16,982 --> 01:55:18,959
Hmm? Hmm? She is 13 years old!

1607
01:55:18,983 --> 01:55:20,294
Abra, I told you to show him.

1608
01:55:20,318 --> 01:55:22,097
- I told him.
- Well, that's not the same.

1609
01:55:22,121 --> 01:55:23,531
I'm gonna kick your ass
before I call the police, huh?

1610
01:55:23,555 --> 01:55:24,699
- Hey, hey, hey!
- No, no, no. Abra.

1611
01:55:24,723 --> 01:55:25,866
Now, don't you say her name.

1612
01:55:25,890 --> 01:55:26,925
Abra...

1613
01:55:27,992 --> 01:55:30,529
[David screaming]

1614
01:55:34,733 --> 01:55:35,935
[screaming stops]

1615
01:55:41,806 --> 01:55:45,085
[Dan] I'm sorry, Mr. Stone.
I am a friend.

1616
01:55:45,109 --> 01:55:47,580
Everything she told you
is true.

1617
01:55:49,113 --> 01:55:50,325
[bottle rattles]

1618
01:55:50,349 --> 01:55:52,093
What the hell is happening?

1619
01:55:52,117 --> 01:55:53,895
I'm sorry.

1620
01:55:53,919 --> 01:55:56,263
Abra needs to
show you something.

1621
01:55:56,287 --> 01:55:57,699
[Billy] <i>I saw the boy.</i>

1622
01:55:57,723 --> 01:55:58,725
<i>I saw his body.</i>

1623
01:55:59,358 --> 01:56:00,901
It's all true.

1624
01:56:00,925 --> 01:56:02,525
Probably, your friend here
put him there.

1625
01:56:03,629 --> 01:56:05,307
You think about that?

1626
01:56:05,331 --> 01:56:06,775
Not for long, I didn't.

1627
01:56:06,799 --> 01:56:09,110
Mr. Stone,
your daughter is special.

1628
01:56:09,134 --> 01:56:10,344
Don't talk about her.

1629
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:12,671
I think you know that.
Deep down.

1630
01:56:14,238 --> 01:56:16,985
She knows what happened
to that little boy,

1631
01:56:17,009 --> 01:56:18,810
and she knows who did it.

1632
01:56:19,812 --> 01:56:20,880
Show him.

1633
01:56:25,250 --> 01:56:26,761
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1634
01:56:26,785 --> 01:56:29,030
I really didn't want to.

1635
01:56:29,054 --> 01:56:30,164
Didn't want to what?

1636
01:56:30,188 --> 01:56:31,690
- [gasps]
- [screaming]

1637
01:56:34,393 --> 01:56:35,828
[breath quivering]

1638
01:56:48,806 --> 01:56:49,817
No, thanks.

1639
01:56:49,841 --> 01:56:51,186
No.

1640
01:56:51,210 --> 01:56:52,345
[bottle rattles]

1641
01:57:00,118 --> 01:57:01,353
Those people...

1642
01:57:03,154 --> 01:57:05,032
they know about my daughter?

1643
01:57:05,056 --> 01:57:06,767
They do.

1644
01:57:06,791 --> 01:57:09,236
And sooner or later,
they're coming.

1645
01:57:09,260 --> 01:57:10,871
We gotta do something.

1646
01:57:10,895 --> 01:57:12,941
All right, we're calling
the police, the FBI...

1647
01:57:12,965 --> 01:57:15,677
[Dan] These people have been
around a long, long time, sir.

1648
01:57:15,701 --> 01:57:17,212
They're rich, connected.

1649
01:57:17,236 --> 01:57:19,780
I don't think they're worried
about the police.

1650
01:57:19,804 --> 01:57:21,249
But where are they?

1651
01:57:21,273 --> 01:57:23,718
When are they coming?
Where can we go?

1652
01:57:23,742 --> 01:57:25,754
Abra can answer that...

1653
01:57:25,778 --> 01:57:27,080
if she's ready.

1654
01:57:28,246 --> 01:57:29,314
I'm ready.

1655
01:57:39,291 --> 01:57:41,302
You sure you wanna do this?

1656
01:57:41,326 --> 01:57:42,795
I have to.

1657
01:57:50,335 --> 01:57:51,770
[sighs]

1658
01:58:25,037 --> 01:58:26,815
I-95.

1659
01:58:26,839 --> 01:58:29,217
Barry, the Crow, the Snake,
and a few others.

1660
01:58:29,241 --> 01:58:31,119
The trees haven't
changed that much,

1661
01:58:31,143 --> 01:58:33,487
so maybe Massachusetts,

1662
01:58:33,511 --> 01:58:35,423
- but they're close.
- Rose?

1663
01:58:35,447 --> 01:58:37,325
Didn't see her.

1664
01:58:37,349 --> 01:58:38,885
But they're coming.

1665
01:58:42,787 --> 01:58:45,165
This is the only room she saw?

1666
01:58:45,189 --> 01:58:46,500
That's right.

1667
01:58:46,524 --> 01:58:49,904
And I made a few changes.
Hid a few things.

1668
01:58:49,928 --> 01:58:51,940
All right.

1669
01:58:51,964 --> 01:58:54,209
Well, they'll be trying
to track you,

1670
01:58:54,233 --> 01:58:56,035
trying to catch on.

1671
01:58:57,903 --> 01:58:59,205
And you're gonna let them.

1672
01:59:00,773 --> 01:59:02,083
Are you crazy?

1673
01:59:02,107 --> 01:59:04,352
Possibly, but you're
gonna let them.

1674
01:59:04,376 --> 01:59:06,879
And then I need you to try
and do a little trick.

1675
01:59:07,912 --> 01:59:09,214
A magic trick?

1676
01:59:17,089 --> 01:59:19,133
They're following us.

1677
01:59:19,157 --> 01:59:22,003
Concentrate. You gotta keep it
up until they land.

1678
01:59:22,027 --> 01:59:23,027
I know.

1679
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:56,271
This should work.

1680
01:59:56,295 --> 01:59:58,831
Good blinds over there,
and there.

1681
02:00:02,134 --> 02:00:03,244
They still close?

1682
02:00:03,268 --> 02:00:04,370
Getting closer, I think.

1683
02:00:05,269 --> 02:00:06,414
This is tough.

1684
02:00:06,438 --> 02:00:08,940
I know. I know.
Not much longer.

1685
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:14,147
Okay, Crow Daddy,

1686
02:00:15,147 --> 02:00:16,448
go get her.

1687
02:01:03,394 --> 02:01:06,074
You look relaxed.

1688
02:01:06,098 --> 02:01:08,501
You feel relaxed,
don't you, Abra?

1689
02:01:09,902 --> 02:01:10,978
I guess.

1690
02:01:11,002 --> 02:01:12,138
[Andi] You should.

1691
02:01:12,938 --> 02:01:14,581
Just relax.

1692
02:01:14,605 --> 02:01:16,250
We're friends.

1693
02:01:16,274 --> 02:01:18,018
You're friends.

1694
02:01:18,042 --> 02:01:19,178
[Andi] That's right.

1695
02:01:20,211 --> 02:01:22,322
Just friends.

1696
02:01:22,346 --> 02:01:25,384
And we want to take you
to meet more friends.

1697
02:01:27,152 --> 02:01:28,287
Good friends.

1698
02:01:32,623 --> 02:01:34,134
Well, shit.

1699
02:01:34,158 --> 02:01:35,637
The way they talked you up,

1700
02:01:35,661 --> 02:01:37,672
I was thinking it'd be
a little harder than that.

1701
02:01:37,696 --> 02:01:38,864
[chuckles]

1702
02:01:42,466 --> 02:01:44,212
The fuck?

1703
02:01:44,236 --> 02:01:46,481
Parlor tricks.
Just fuckin' parlor tricks.

No! Get out of there!

You deserve it. All of you.

Stop.

02:03:41,219 --> 02:03:44,056
I just got one question
for you, sweetie.

1731

Aren't you sleepy?

I didn't see the Crow.
Where is the Crow?

Hello, Abra.

Abra!

1758
02:05:18,817 --> 02:05:20,586
[David] Get away from her.

1759
02:05:23,721 --> 02:05:24,723
Step back.

1760
02:05:27,725 --> 02:05:29,394
Sure thing, Dad.

1761
02:05:31,229 --> 02:05:33,206
You know, I'm glad
I got to meet you.

1762
02:05:33,230 --> 02:05:35,843
I'll fucking kill you.
Step back.

Some brave words.

1764
02:05:37,736 --> 02:05:41,273
Always tickles me,
watching you rubes threaten a god.

1765
02:05:42,407 --> 02:05:44,552
You know, your little girl,

1766
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:48,188
she's maybe the best food
we'll ever have.

1767
02:05:48,212 --> 02:05:51,382
I'm so glad I had a chance
to compliment the chef.

Oh, good, you're awake.

02:06:51,576 --> 02:06:53,521
What's wrong with me?

1773
02:06:53,545 --> 02:06:55,623
You've been dosed, missy.

1774
02:06:55,647 --> 02:06:58,392
More than
I've ever used before.

1775
02:06:58,416 --> 02:07:00,727
Might let you wake up
here and there,

1776
02:07:00,751 --> 02:07:03,221
but that steam of yours
is fast asleep.

My dad...

1778
02:07:08,926 --> 02:07:10,771
What happened to my dad?

1779
02:07:10,795 --> 02:07:12,565
Lot of good people
killed today.

1780
02:07:13,531 --> 02:07:14,934
Lot of good people.

1781
02:07:16,635 --> 02:07:18,946
I'd love to tell you
someone will pay,

1782
02:07:18,970 --> 02:07:23,918
some kind of justice raining
down on the sad events today,

1783
02:07:23,942 --> 02:07:26,454
but it don't work like that.

1784
02:07:26,478 --> 02:07:28,247
We were always gonna have you.

1785
02:07:29,514 --> 02:07:31,825
Some of my people are dead.

1786
02:07:31,849 --> 02:07:33,518
Some of yours are dead.

1787

Outcome didn't change, though.

1788
02:07:37,621 --> 02:07:38,890
Think on that a minute.

1789
02:07:39,957 --> 02:07:41,559
The outcome didn't change.

1790
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:43,729
So, their deaths,

1791
02:07:44,729 --> 02:07:46,574
all of them,

1792
02:07:46,598 --> 02:07:48,875
just a waste.

1793
02:07:48,899 --> 02:07:50,311
A waste you brought on

1794
02:07:50,335 --> 02:07:52,413
to us all, young lady.

1795
02:07:52,437 --> 02:07:53,580
For what?

02:07:55,473 --> 02:07:57,351
Please hear me...

1798
02:07:57,375 --> 02:08:00,288
[Crow] Ain't nobody
hearing you.

1799
02:08:00,312 --> 02:08:02,680
Might as well calm down
and enjoy the ride.

1800
02:08:03,715 --> 02:08:05,993
Like I said,

1801
02:08:06,017 --> 02:08:08,287
outcome hasn't changed.

02:08:28,572 --> 02:08:29,774
[Dan] No.

1805
02:08:31,509 --> 02:08:32,953
Please.

1806
02:08:32,977 --> 02:08:35,046
Oh, please, please, please.

1807
02:08:36,613 --> 02:08:37,649
Please.

1808
02:08:41,353 --> 02:08:42,621

1812
02:08:54,366 --> 02:08:55,634
Tony?

1813
02:08:57,669 --> 02:08:59,537
Help me, please, Tony.

1814
02:09:05,143 --> 02:09:06,444
God.

Okay, okay.

1818
02:09:20,591 --> 02:09:23,003
Okay, you always said...
[sniffs]

1819
02:09:23,027 --> 02:09:24,804
your brain was like a radio.

1820
02:09:24,828 --> 02:09:27,641
No one's answering when you
call, so stop calling.

1821
02:09:27,665 --> 02:09:29,068
And just listen.

02:10:04,669 --> 02:10:05,780
Hi.

1827
02:10:05,804 --> 02:10:06,872
[whispers] Dan.

1828
02:10:10,073 --> 02:10:11,442
Did he drug you?

1829
02:10:12,810 --> 02:10:13,978
I'm so sorry.

1830
02:10:15,746 --> 02:10:17,691
I'm gonna try something, okay?

1831
02:10:17,715 --> 02:10:18,691
But you're weak.

1832
02:10:18,715 --> 02:10:20,561
He's blocking you.

1833
02:10:20,585 --> 02:10:22,730
I could barely hear you.

1834
02:10:22,754 --> 02:10:24,422
You gotta trust me, okay?

1835
02:10:26,056 --> 02:10:27,526
Okay?

1836
02:10:41,473 --> 02:10:43,883
Awake again, huh?

1837
02:10:43,907 --> 02:10:47,078
[clicks tongue] Might have to
dose you at the next rest stop.

1838
02:10:49,147 --> 02:10:50,649
Where are we going?

1839
02:10:51,616 --> 02:10:52,850
Mm, you know where.

1840
02:10:53,917 --> 02:10:55,987
Fuck, I feel hungover.

1841
02:10:58,857 --> 02:11:01,535
I told you it's good shit.

1842
02:11:01,559 --> 02:11:04,672
Haven't felt hungover in years.
And, you know, I don't miss it.

1843
02:11:04,696 --> 02:11:05,898
Not even a little.

1844
02:11:08,032 --> 02:11:09,843
West, huh?

1845
02:11:09,867 --> 02:11:12,770
Stayin' off the major roads.
Smart.

1846
02:11:14,839 --> 02:11:17,576
Crownville. New York.

1847
02:11:20,745 --> 02:11:22,990
Who are you?

1848
02:11:23,014 --> 02:11:24,817
I'm the guy
that killed your friends.

1849
02:11:30,787 --> 02:11:32,156
It's nice to meet you.

1850
02:11:34,024 --> 02:11:35,669
Neat trick.

1851
02:11:35,693 --> 02:11:37,638
Haven't seen this one before.

1852
02:11:37,662 --> 02:11:39,231
Wanna see one more?

1853
02:11:42,666 --> 02:11:46,137
Don't imagine Rose'll be too
happy if you shoot the prize.

1854
02:11:48,872 --> 02:11:52,285
I don't suppose Rose will be
happy about any of this.

1855
02:11:52,309 --> 02:11:55,054
And when that woman gets mad...

1856
02:11:55,078 --> 02:11:57,691
Well, it seems to me
you know enough

1857
02:11:57,715 --> 02:12:00,593
to know you might wanna
sit this one out.

1858
02:12:00,617 --> 02:12:02,062
Count your blessings.

1859
02:12:02,086 --> 02:12:03,931
Go on your way.

What's so funny, friend?

1862
02:12:07,791 --> 02:12:11,771
Well, it's just arrogance.
It's arrogance, really.

1863
02:12:11,795 --> 02:12:15,174
But it makes sense,
if you think you're gonna live forever.

1864
02:12:15,198 --> 02:12:19,571
Stands to reason,
of course you wouldn't wear your seatbelt.

What have you done?

02:14:29,300 --> 02:14:31,069
All right, bitch child.

Dozed off.

No, you earned it.

Where are we?

Ohio.

Where are we going?

1888
02:15:53,451 --> 02:15:54,453
Colorado.

1889
02:15:56,153 --> 02:15:57,723
Why Colorado?

1890
02:16:00,224 --> 02:16:01,993
She's gonna keep coming.

1891
02:16:03,126 --> 02:16:04,729
- I know.
- Always.

1892
02:16:06,096 --> 02:16:07,473
This only ends if we end it,

1893
02:16:07,497 --> 02:16:09,942
and I don't think
we can beat her.

1894
02:16:09,966 --> 02:16:11,402
Not by ourselves.

1895
02:16:13,571 --> 02:16:15,214
There's a place.

1896
02:16:15,238 --> 02:16:18,051
A place that's dangerous
for people like us.

1897
02:16:18,075 --> 02:16:21,221
The place you told me about?
The hungry place?

1898
02:16:21,245 --> 02:16:22,889
Yeah, that's right.

1899
02:16:22,913 --> 02:16:25,793
If it's so dangerous,
why would we go there?

1900
02:16:25,817 --> 02:16:28,195
Well, if it's dangerous
for people like us,

1901
02:16:28,219 --> 02:16:31,130
I expect it's dangerous
for people like her.

1902
02:16:31,154 --> 02:16:32,890
Maybe even more so.

1903
02:16:33,957 --> 02:16:34,957
Good.

1904
02:16:36,026 --> 02:16:37,795
She's following us, you know.

1905
02:16:38,895 --> 02:16:40,799
Yeah, good. Let her.

1906
02:16:48,406 --> 02:16:50,107
I'm sorry about your father.

1907

Oh, thank God!

When we're safe, you'll call her
and tell her where to find us?

1919
02:17:38,455 --> 02:17:39,600
I will.

1920
02:17:39,624 --> 02:17:41,026
Okay.

Here's what we're gonna do.

1925
02:19:54,425 --> 02:19:57,269
You're gonna stay in the car,
keep the heater running.

1926
02:19:57,293 --> 02:20:00,474
I don't want you spending a minute
inside there if you don't have to.

1927
02:20:00,498 --> 02:20:02,242
She can only come from here.

1928
02:20:02,266 --> 02:20:03,777
You can see her a mile out,
easy.

1929

You see lights
on the mountain over there,

1930
02:20:06,169 --> 02:20:07,714
you blast me, okay?

1931
02:20:07,738 --> 02:20:11,183
But I don't want you going in.
Not until she's here.

1932
02:20:11,207 --> 02:20:13,687
You aren't waiting with me?

1933

I can't.

1934
02:20:14,677 --> 02:20:15,679
Why not?

1935
02:20:16,647 --> 02:20:18,249
I have to wake it up.

Not for long, I imagine.

[man] You're a whiskey man,
are you not?

1953
02:26:08,665 --> 02:26:10,767
I was, most of the time.

[man] On the house.

1955

This was your brand.

Jack Daniel's.

1957
02:26:27,617 --> 02:26:29,995
I used to see the bottles
in our home.

1958
02:26:30,019 --> 02:26:33,532
Our real home, before all this.

1959
02:26:33,556 --> 02:26:36,728
I smelled one once. It smelled
like something on fire,

1960
02:26:37,894 --> 02:26:40,573
which I suppose it was.

1961

[man] I'm afraid you've
confused me with someone else.

It's Lloyd.

02:26:45,168 --> 02:26:46,570
Lloyd.

1964
02:26:47,904 --> 02:26:50,048
I apologize, Mr. Torrance.

1965
02:26:50,072 --> 02:26:53,986
I don't know where everyone is,
but it'll pick up.

1966
02:26:54,010 --> 02:26:55,888
Oh, I know where they are.

1967
02:26:55,912 --> 02:26:57,014
And you're right...

1968
02:26:57,881 --> 02:26:59,050
it'll pick up.

1969
02:27:01,218 --> 02:27:04,020
If you don't mind my saying,
Mr. Torrance, you seem...

1970
02:27:05,656 --> 02:27:06,791
put upon.

1971
02:27:07,791 --> 02:27:09,635
Put upon?

1972
02:27:09,659 --> 02:27:10,927
Ain't that the way.

1973
02:27:11,928 --> 02:27:13,873
Man just living his life,

1974
02:27:13,897 --> 02:27:15,975
trying to do his work.

1975
02:27:15,999 --> 02:27:18,076
He gets put upon.

1976
02:27:18,100 --> 02:27:19,846
Pulled into
other people's problems.

1977
02:27:19,870 --> 02:27:22,706
I see it all the time,
if you don't mind my saying.

1978
02:27:25,676 --> 02:27:27,678
So we lived in Florida.

1979
02:27:28,712 --> 02:27:29,722
I'm sorry?

1980
02:27:29,746 --> 02:27:31,790
Mom and I.

1981
02:27:31,814 --> 02:27:34,085
I'm afraid I don't know
who you mean.

1982
02:27:36,620 --> 02:27:39,599
We never wanted
to see snow again,

1983
02:27:39,623 --> 02:27:41,801
so we lived in Florida.

1984
02:27:41,825 --> 02:27:45,071
Tiny place, but it was
comfortable, and we were happy.

1985
02:27:45,095 --> 02:27:46,998
I mean, we were grieving.

1986
02:27:49,766 --> 02:27:51,710
We were traumatized,

1987
02:27:51,734 --> 02:27:53,504
but there was happiness too.

1988
02:27:56,706 --> 02:27:57,706
She...

1989
02:27:59,209 --> 02:28:01,487
She would look away.

1990
02:28:01,511 --> 02:28:04,916
She'd look at me, but she'd always
look away after a second or two.

1991
02:28:06,183 --> 02:28:08,027
It took me a while
to notice it.

1992
02:28:08,051 --> 02:28:10,496
But after the Overlook, she
wouldn't look me in the eyes,

1993
02:28:10,520 --> 02:28:12,232
not for long.

1994
02:28:12,256 --> 02:28:13,858
Couldn't figure it out.

1995
02:28:16,293 --> 02:28:17,294
But it...

1996
02:28:21,163 --> 02:28:22,533
It was you.

1997
02:28:24,867 --> 02:28:28,538
She saw your eyes in me,
and she'd have to look away.

1998
02:28:29,907 --> 02:28:31,751
It tortured her
to have to do that.

1999
02:28:31,775 --> 02:28:33,653
So, I fixed it.

2000
02:28:33,677 --> 02:28:36,689
I fixed it for her, and it was
the last time I ever used it.

2001
02:28:36,713 --> 02:28:39,750
So that she wouldn't see you
anymore when she looked at me.

2002
02:28:42,819 --> 02:28:45,098
I was 20 when she died.

2003
02:28:45,122 --> 02:28:48,967
And back then, I saw
when someone was gonna die.

2004
02:28:48,991 --> 02:28:51,170
I saw flies. Black flies.

2005
02:28:51,194 --> 02:28:55,040
"Death flies," I called them,
circling people's faces.

2006
02:28:55,064 --> 02:28:57,911
And in those last weeks,
she was covered...

2007
02:28:57,935 --> 02:28:59,778
Her whole face.

2008
02:28:59,802 --> 02:29:02,915
I could barely see her eyes.

2009
02:29:02,939 --> 02:29:07,853
And I... I tried to comfort her,
but I could hardly look at her.

2010
02:29:07,877 --> 02:29:09,779
And she saw that.

2011
02:29:12,115 --> 02:29:14,192
She just lay there dying,

2012
02:29:14,216 --> 02:29:16,120
with her son
who couldn't look at her.

2013
02:29:22,159 --> 02:29:25,838
Maybe something warm to
push away such unpleasantries.

2014
02:29:25,862 --> 02:29:28,907
Don't you wanna hear about it?
She was your wife.

2015
02:29:28,931 --> 02:29:32,045
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

2016
02:29:32,069 --> 02:29:35,348
- I'm just a bartender.
- Oh, yeah?

2017
02:29:35,372 --> 02:29:38,617
Just Lloyd the bartender,
pouring joy at the Overlook Hotel.

2018
02:29:38,641 --> 02:29:41,211
I'll pour whatever you like,
Mr. Torrance.

2019
02:29:42,812 --> 02:29:43,947
Oh, Dad.

2020
02:29:45,882 --> 02:29:48,093
This drink will cost
an awful lot.

2021
02:29:48,117 --> 02:29:50,128
Your money is no good here.

2022
02:29:50,152 --> 02:29:51,998
Orders from the house.

2023
02:29:52,022 --> 02:29:53,966
It'll cost more than money.

2024
02:29:53,990 --> 02:29:56,335
It'll cost me eight years.

2025
02:29:56,359 --> 02:29:58,870
Eight behind me, and who knows
how many in front of me.

2026
02:29:58,894 --> 02:30:01,331
Your credit is fine,
Mr. Torrance.

2027
02:30:08,804 --> 02:30:10,675
Man takes a drink,

2028
02:30:11,775 --> 02:30:13,077
the drink takes a drink,

2029
02:30:14,243 --> 02:30:16,079
and then the drink takes a man.

2030
02:30:17,147 --> 02:30:18,848
Ain't it so, Dad?

2031
02:30:22,986 --> 02:30:24,287
Medicine.

2032
02:30:25,989 --> 02:30:27,858
Medicine is what it is.

2033
02:30:28,858 --> 02:30:31,103
Bona fide cure-all.

2034
02:30:31,127 --> 02:30:35,966
Depression, stress, remorse,
failure, wipes it all away.

2035
02:30:37,733 --> 02:30:39,803
The mind is a blackboard.

2036
02:30:40,269 --> 02:30:41,605
And this

2037
02:30:42,304 --> 02:30:43,808
is the eraser.

2038
02:30:49,079 --> 02:30:51,189
A man tries.

2039
02:30:51,213 --> 02:30:52,349
He provides.

2040
02:30:53,749 --> 02:30:55,928
But he's surrounded by mouths.

2041
02:30:55,952 --> 02:30:59,064
that eat, and scream, and cry,
and nag.

2042
02:30:59,088 --> 02:31:02,701
So, he asks for one thing,
just one thing for him.

2043
02:31:02,725 --> 02:31:04,236
To warm him up...

2044
02:31:04,260 --> 02:31:07,305
to take the sting out of
those days of the mouths,

2045
02:31:07,329 --> 02:31:10,075
eating, and eating, and eating
everything he makes,

2046
02:31:10,099 --> 02:31:12,679
everything he has.

2047
02:31:12,703 --> 02:31:14,246
And a family.

2048
02:31:14,270 --> 02:31:16,373
A wife, a kid.

2049
02:31:17,908 --> 02:31:20,252
Those mouths eat time.

2050
02:31:20,276 --> 02:31:21,879
They eat your days on Earth.

2051
02:31:23,279 --> 02:31:24,882
They just gobble them up.

2052
02:31:26,348 --> 02:31:28,752
It's enough to make a man sick.

2053
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:30,787
And this...

2054
02:31:32,122 --> 02:31:34,025
is the medicine.

2055
02:31:36,159 --> 02:31:39,105
So, tell me, pup,

2056
02:31:39,129 --> 02:31:41,766
are you gonna
take your medicine?

2057
02:31:44,801 --> 02:31:46,378
I'm not.

2058
02:31:46,402 --> 02:31:47,404
[glass shatters]

2059
02:31:48,404 --> 02:31:49,749
Oh.

2060
02:31:49,773 --> 02:31:51,117
Look at that. I'm sorry.

2061
02:31:51,141 --> 02:31:54,111
Clumsy old me, Mr. Torrance.
Forgive me.

2062
02:31:55,746 --> 02:31:57,114
Let's get you cleaned up.

2063
02:32:15,431 --> 02:32:17,410
Management is concerned.

2064
02:32:17,434 --> 02:32:18,803
Concerned?

2065
02:32:21,170 --> 02:32:23,750
It's horrible
what she's done to you.

2066
02:32:23,774 --> 02:32:25,443
Pulled you into her mess.

2067
02:32:27,944 --> 02:32:29,313
A smart man?

2068
02:32:30,347 --> 02:32:33,359
He'd let her handle it.

2069
02:32:33,383 --> 02:32:36,895
Let things unfold
as they're meant to.

2070
02:32:36,919 --> 02:32:39,290
Why should you
pay her tab, Doc?

2071
02:32:41,024 --> 02:32:43,069
And for what?

2072
02:32:43,093 --> 02:32:46,939
For this little girl
who started all this trouble?

2073
02:32:46,963 --> 02:32:49,500
What would management
have me do about that?

2074
02:32:50,167 --> 02:32:52,311
Nothing.

2075
02:32:52,335 --> 02:32:55,248
Easiest thing in the world
to do, son.

2076
02:32:55,272 --> 02:32:57,449
Just bring her inside.

2077
02:32:57,473 --> 02:32:59,951
And then, well,

2078
02:32:59,975 --> 02:33:03,079
you accept the things
you cannot change.

2079

02:33:24,466 --> 02:33:25,935
[Dan] Okay.

2082
02:33:40,383 --> 02:33:43,094
This place is sick.

2083
02:33:43,118 --> 02:33:45,464
Sick like my momo was sick.

2084
02:33:45,488 --> 02:33:47,099
It's cancer,

2085
02:33:47,123 --> 02:33:49,402
only worse.

We head inside. She'll find us.

[Rose] Well, well, well.

2092
02:35:54,451 --> 02:35:56,162
Hi there.

2093
02:35:56,186 --> 02:35:59,397
[Dan] <i>When this starts, run.</i>

2094
02:35:59,421 --> 02:36:02,268
[Rose] Yes, you run, dear.

2095
02:36:02,292 --> 02:36:04,636
And then I will find you

2096
02:36:04,660 --> 02:36:08,531
and you will scream for years
until you die.

2097
02:36:10,599 --> 02:36:13,244
We'll see
who does the screaming.

2098
02:36:13,268 --> 02:36:15,046
Oh, we'll see indeed.

2099
02:36:15,070 --> 02:36:17,048
[Dan] She's right, you know.

2100
02:36:17,072 --> 02:36:18,541
You should be afraid.

2101
02:36:19,709 --> 02:36:22,120
Why is that?

2102
02:36:22,144 --> 02:36:24,724
Because you don't know
where you're standing.

I'm sorry, who are you,

02:36:36,125 --> 02:36:37,126
Go.

You've made some improvements,
haven't you?

2111
02:37:44,126 --> 02:37:46,638

I was in your mind.

Mm. Brave words, dear.

You've got a darkness in you,
dear.

2125
02:38:53,562 --> 02:38:57,100
I think the only difference
between you and me is time.

2126
02:38:57,567 --> 02:38:58,677
[groans]

2127
02:38:58,701 --> 02:39:00,504
[gasping]

2128
02:39:06,576 --> 02:39:08,178
You don't know yet...

2129
02:39:08,845 --> 02:39:10,247
what you'd do...

2130
02:39:11,180 --> 02:39:13,825
for more time.

2131
02:39:13,849 --> 02:39:17,354
But I promise you, dear,
oh, you'd be surprised.

2132
02:39:18,721 --> 02:39:19,721
[grunts]

2133

[sighs]

2134
02:39:22,792 --> 02:39:24,695
[Abra] Pain purifies steam.

2135
02:39:25,794 --> 02:39:29,665
Fear, too, so, you understand.

2136
02:39:42,678 --> 02:39:43,678
[grunts softly]

2137
02:39:47,917 --> 02:39:49,494
[Abra choking]

2138
02:39:49,518 --> 02:39:52,297
I was just like you
when I was younger.

2139
02:39:52,321 --> 02:39:53,689
I was special

2140
02:39:54,657 --> 02:39:56,701
and alone.

2141
02:39:56,725 --> 02:39:59,370
But I met someone who gave me the
gift of purpose, of community.

2142
02:39:59,394 --> 02:40:01,406
And I might have given you
such a gift

2143
02:40:01,430 --> 02:40:04,334
if things would
have gone differently.

2144
02:40:07,002 --> 02:40:09,280
No?

2145
02:40:09,304 --> 02:40:11,216
Defiant, aren't you?

2146
02:40:11,240 --> 02:40:12,317
[continues choking]

2147
02:40:12,341 --> 02:40:13,751
So much like me.

2148
02:40:13,775 --> 02:40:16,779
Your mind is so...

2149
02:40:19,382 --> 02:40:21,385
This isn't your mind, is it?

2150
02:40:23,953 --> 02:40:25,689
This isn't you at all.

2151
02:40:27,924 --> 02:40:30,259
You're just the bait.

2152
02:40:32,394 --> 02:40:33,706
[grunts]

2153
02:40:33,730 --> 02:40:34,730
Enough!

[gasps]

2155
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:39,502
[Dan panting] Run.

2156
02:40:41,704 --> 02:40:43,840
How the hell did we miss you?

2157
02:40:44,540 --> 02:40:45,717
[groans]

2158
02:40:45,741 --> 02:40:46,985
Oh...

2159
02:40:47,009 --> 02:40:49,579
You and I should have met
years ago.

2160
02:40:53,049 --> 02:40:54,318
Danny.

2161
02:40:55,384 --> 02:40:59,297
That's your name, isn't it?

2162
02:40:59,321 --> 02:41:02,801
Well, something happens to the
steam when you rubes get older.

2163
02:41:02,825 --> 02:41:04,969
It gets polluted.

2164
02:41:04,993 --> 02:41:06,705
Dirty.

2165
02:41:06,729 --> 02:41:07,731
You know that.

2166
02:41:08,998 --> 02:41:11,777
I see the grease all over you.

2167
02:41:11,801 --> 02:41:14,779
You don't shine quite the same.

2168
02:41:14,803 --> 02:41:17,340
Growing up spoils that,
I guess.

2169
02:41:19,641 --> 02:41:21,587
Seriously, handsome,

2170
02:41:21,611 --> 02:41:24,313
where have you been hiding?

2171
02:41:27,317 --> 02:41:29,018
I can make you an offer.

2172
02:41:30,519 --> 02:41:32,364
An offer I rarely make.

2173
02:41:32,388 --> 02:41:34,832
Oh, yeah? I can't wait.

2174
02:41:34,856 --> 02:41:36,769
Such a gifted boy

2175
02:41:36,793 --> 02:41:40,638
hiding his light
under a bushel for so long.

2176
02:41:40,662 --> 02:41:45,044
You could live a long, long
time. Live well, too.

2177
02:41:45,068 --> 02:41:49,615
Indulge yourself,
no consequences,

2178
02:41:49,639 --> 02:41:51,275
no hangovers.

2179
02:41:52,874 --> 02:41:55,554
Eat well, live long.

2180
02:41:55,578 --> 02:41:58,556
You must be lonely,
being the last one.

2181
02:41:58,580 --> 02:42:00,725
I mean,
the last one in the world.

2182
02:42:00,749 --> 02:42:03,386
Sweetie, I'm not the last.
Far from it.

2183
02:42:04,620 --> 02:42:06,465
I'm just the prettiest.

2184
02:42:06,489 --> 02:42:08,525
I assume you know my answer.

2185
02:42:10,025 --> 02:42:11,369
Pity.

2186
02:42:11,393 --> 02:42:12,895
So, are we doing this or not?

2187
02:42:13,963 --> 02:42:15,966

I seem to have nicked
your femoral artery there.

2196

Why, you're gonna
bleed to death, huh?

My, my, what a temper you have.

2200
02:42:54,504 --> 02:42:56,013
So much fire.

2201
02:42:56,037 --> 02:42:57,815
Such a waste!

2202
02:42:57,839 --> 02:42:59,484

You've been very, very bad.

You're not Uncle Dan.

Why are you smiling?

where you're standing.

2301
02:51:02,258 --> 02:51:03,902
[Abra] Come on, Uncle Dan.

2302
02:51:03,926 --> 02:51:05,061
Get out of there.

2303
02:51:06,495 --> 02:51:07,597
Come on.

02:51:23,645 --> 02:51:25,214
<i>Purifying it.</i>

2308
02:51:26,649 --> 02:51:28,660
I could almost hear it...

2309
02:51:28,684 --> 02:51:29,684
screaming.

2310
02:51:31,186 --> 02:51:33,931
I could hear it dying.

2311
02:51:33,955 --> 02:51:36,491
And deep inside, I knew...

2312
02:51:39,361 --> 02:51:40,997
I knew you were okay.

2313
02:51:42,563 --> 02:51:44,434
I'm sorry I put you in danger.

2314
02:51:45,600 --> 02:51:47,002
It was the only way.

2315
02:51:48,070 --> 02:51:49,305
I know.

2316
02:51:50,406 --> 02:51:53,551
Do you think she was right

2317
02:51:53,575 --> 02:51:55,612
when she said
she wasn't the last one?

2318
02:51:56,979 --> 02:51:58,381
The world's a hungry place.

2319
02:51:59,248 --> 02:52:01,927
A dark place.

2320
02:52:01,951 --> 02:52:05,529
Maybe there's more of them
or things like them or worse,

2321
02:52:05,553 --> 02:52:07,389
but there are more people
like you, too.

2322
02:52:08,222 --> 02:52:09,959
People who stand.

2323
02:52:13,428 --> 02:52:15,306
I told you
when I first met you,

2324
02:52:15,330 --> 02:52:17,966
I told you that
you should hide.

2325
02:52:19,367 --> 02:52:21,371
That you should
keep your head down.

2326
02:52:22,471 --> 02:52:24,407
Keep your shine out of sight.

2327
02:52:26,474 --> 02:52:27,910
But I was wrong.

2328
02:52:31,145 --> 02:52:32,916
Shine on, Abra Stone.

2329
02:52:36,017 --> 02:52:38,262
You shine on.

No one.

2334
02:52:50,465 --> 02:52:51,567
Hmm.

2335
02:52:58,306 --> 02:52:59,542
That's not true.

2336
02:53:03,678 --> 02:53:05,180
I was talking to Dan.

2337
02:53:13,054 --> 02:53:15,190
We go on after.

2338
02:53:16,090 --> 02:53:17,769
We go on.

2339
02:53:17,793 --> 02:53:19,195
And he's okay.

2340
02:53:20,294 --> 02:53:21,496
So is Daddy.

2341
02:53:22,697 --> 02:53:24,166
He really is.

2342
02:53:28,169 --> 02:53:29,438
Good.

2343
02:53:41,050 --> 02:53:42,418
