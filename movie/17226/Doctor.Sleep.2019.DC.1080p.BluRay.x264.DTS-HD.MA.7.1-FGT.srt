1
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,944
你要去哪里 维奥莱特？
Where are you going, Violet?

2
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,013
只是为了摘些花
Just to pick some flowers.

3
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:45,956
不要走太远
Don't wander too far.

4
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:57,979
我的野生爱尔兰玫瑰
My wild Irish Rose

5
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,324
生长最甜美的花朵
The sweetest flower that grows

6

您可以查找所有位置

7
00:01:07,476 --> 00:01:15,816
但没有人能与我狂野的爱尔兰玫瑰相比
But none can compare with my wild Irish Rose

8
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,742
哦 你好！
Oh, hi there!

9
00:01:21,305 --> 00:01:22,793
你想要一个吗？
Do you want one?

10
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,454
你想知道我为什么戴这么有趣的帽子吗？
You are wondering why I'm wearing such a funny hat.

11

我总是戴这顶帽子

12
00:01:38,842 --> 00:01:40,864
这么多 这是我的名字的一部分 现在

13
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:45,274
我的朋友 我最好的朋友
My friends, my very very best friends.

14
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:47,949
他们只是叫我玫瑰帽子

15

它看起来像一顶魔术师的帽子

是的

00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:54,505
这是一顶魔法帽
It's a magic hat.

18
00:01:55,339 --> 00:01:56,494
你想看吗？
Do you wanna see?

19
00:01:58,202 --> 00:01:59,855
我的袖子上什么都没有
Nothing up my sleeves.

20
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:03,866
我的帽子里什么都没有
Nothing in my hat.

21
00:02:06,898 --> 00:02:08,066
别担心 那是我的朋友
Don't worry, that's my friend.

22
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:09,254
你错过了窍门
You're missing the trick.

23
00:02:09,702 --> 00:02:10,880
伸进里面
Reach inside.

24
00:02:16,047 --> 00:02:18,763
哇！太漂亮了

因为它很特别
Because it's special.

26
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:22,753
说到特别
And speaking of special.

27
00:02:22,961 --> 00:02:25,860
你也有点神奇 不是吗？
You are a little magic too, aren't you?

28
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,702
我手中的花是什么颜色的？

紫色
Purple.

00:02:39,454 --> 00:02:42,602
维奥莱特！像你一样

31
00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:47,469
你不吃花！
You don't eat flowers!

32
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:49,024
但是你确实.
But you do.

33

亲爱的 是特别的 味道最好

我应该回到我妈妈家

36
00:03:00,087 --> 00:03:02,612
不 留下来 呆一会儿 看看更多的魔法
No, stay, stay a while, see more magic.

37
00:03:08,727 --> 00:03:11,411
你是个特别的小东西 不是吗？
You are a special little thing, aren't you?

38
00:05:57,784 --> 00:05:59,305
不 请...
No, please...

39
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:06,229
嘿 没事的 医生
Hey, it's okay, Doc.

40
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:08,603
没关系
It's okay.

41
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:16,965
那里 都干了
There, all dry.

42
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,922
发生了什么事？
What happened?

43
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,337
你必须跟我谈谈 丹尼
You have to talk to me, Danny.

44
00:06:29,109 --> 00:06:30,660
自从我们离开后你没说话...
You haven't talked since we left...

45
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,070
求你了 医生

所以
So...

48
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:56,396
你不说话吧 医生？
You ain't talking, huh, Doc?

49
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,445
我第一次见到你时 也没说太多话
Weren't talking much the first time I met you neither.

50
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:09,114
你还记得我们第一次真正交谈吗？
You remember the first time we really talked?

51
00:07:09,271 --> 00:07:11,372
当我在你的脑袋里说话的时候
When I spoke up inside your head.

52
00:07:12,993 --> 00:07:14,931
让你感觉很好 对吧？
Made you feel good, right?

53
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:16,917
知道你并不孤单
Knowing you're not alone.

54
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:19,897
有人也是为我做的
Someone did that for me too.

55
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:24,610
有一天 丹尼・托伦斯 你会教别人的
And someday, Danny Torrance, you'll teach someone else.

56
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:26,297
我不会的
I won't.

57
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:28,487
不 你不会的 嗯？
No, you won't, huh?

58
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:32,263
我不会发光的 我是说 别再说了 这很危险
I won't shine, I mean. No more, it's dangerous.

59
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,078
非常好 有时
Very good it is. Sometimes.

60
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:37,440
她找到我了
She found me.

61
00:07:37,605 --> 00:07:40,433
她会回来回来 直到她得到我
She'll come back and come back until she gets me.

62
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,957
你是对的
You're right.

63
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:44,719
俯瞰的谴责
The Overlook's condemned.

64
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:49,250
登上 有饥饿的老鬼在那里 伸手向你
Boarded up, there are starving old ghosts in there, reaching out for you.

65
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:51,140
也不会停止与她
Won't stop with her, either.

66
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:53,207
书中的图片
Pictures in the book.

67
00:07:53,565 --> 00:07:56,745
你说他们只是书上的照片 它们不会伤害我
You said they were just pictures in the book, and they couldn't hurt me.

68
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:03,074
有些东西 黑暗的东西
Some things, dark things.

69
00:08:03,497 --> 00:08:05,201
光芒就像食物
The shining is like food.

70
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,500
俯瞰 它总是只是图片对我来说
The Overlook, it was always just pictures to me.

71
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,330
但我不像你那样发光
But I didn't shine like you.

72
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:16,617
没有人像你一样发光
Nobody shines like you.

73
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:19,666
所以你住在那该死的旅馆里
So you in that damn hotel,

74
00:08:19,795 --> 00:08:24,027
你就像一百万瓦的电池 全部接通了电源
you were like a million watt battery, all plugged in.

75
00:08:24,027 --> 00:08:25,516
它吃了它
And it ate it up.

76
00:08:28,114 --> 00:08:30,080
世界是个饥饿的地方
World's a hungry place.

77
00:08:31,697 --> 00:08:35,320
最黑暗的东西是饥饿的 他们会吃什么闪耀
And the darkest things are the hungriest, and they'll eat what shines.

78
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:40,594
像蚊子一样 像水痘一样涌来 对此无能为力
Swarm in, like mosquitoes, leeches. Can't do nothing about that.

79
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:44,962
您可以做什么
What you can do

80
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:49,413
是转向他们来反对他们
is turn what they come for against them.

81
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:54,056
我的祖父
My grandfather.

82
00:08:55,383 --> 00:08:57,413
他是个贱人的儿子
He was a mean son of a bitch.

83
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:02,668
里面很黑和你爸爸一样的黑暗
Dark inside. Same type of dark as your dad.

84
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:08,186
打我毫无意义 我奶奶也 他死后我跳舞
Beat me senseless and my grandma too. And when he died I danced.

85
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:10,637
但他回来了
But he came home coming back.

86
00:09:12,581 --> 00:09:14,253
站在我房间里
Standing in my room.

87
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:20,749
适合所有灰色和臭从任何模具生长在他身上的盒子
Suit all gray and stinking from whatever mold was growing on him in that box.

88
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:24,240
奶奶...
So, grandma...

89
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,180
她教我一个窍门
She taught me a trick.

90
00:09:30,816 --> 00:09:32,493
给了我一个监狱
Gave me a prison.

91
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:37,660
我想让你知道这个盒子
I want you to know this box.

92
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:40,084
从内到外
Inside and out.

93
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:42,667
不要只是看它 触摸它
Don't just look at it, touch it.

94
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:46,600
把你的鼻子去 看看是否有气味
Stick your nose inside, see if there is a smell.

95
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:47,921
为什么？
Why?

96
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:52,193
因为你要建立一个就像在你的脑海里一样
Because you gonna build one just like it in your mind.

97
00:09:52,494 --> 00:09:54,321
更特别的一个
One even more special.

98
00:09:54,784 --> 00:09:56,808
下次那个婊子来了
So next time that bitch comes around.

99
00:09:57,808 --> 00:09:59,331
你会准备好的
You'll be ready.

100
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,721
让我们把你带回妈妈家

101
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:05,150

聊天室浪漫 小女孩 没有意思
Chat-room romance, little girls, not interesting.

146
00:16:01,234 --> 00:16:04,370
看着我 看看我是否答应了
Just watch, see if there's thing I promised.

147
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,447
最好是 因为她不是那种蒸汽
It better be, 'cause she's not all that steamy.

148
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:09,557
她去了
There she goes.

149
00:16:10,217 --> 00:16:12,272
你不累吗？
Aren't you tired?

150

Sleep.

等 这是最好的部分

I watched her do it 3 times now, and it never gets old.

154
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:45,149
睡得更深 尽可能深
Sleep deeper. Deep as you can.

155
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,099
你感受到的痛苦只是一场梦
The pain you feel is only a dream.

156
00:16:52,771 --> 00:16:58,336
当你妻子问的时候 你可以解释一个丢失的钱包
You can explain a lost wallet, when your wife asks.

157
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,113
但你不能解释吗？
But you can't explain this?

158
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:07,151
当你看着镜子时 你每天都会看到这个
This you'll see every day when you look in the mirror.

159
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:12,696
每次你看到它 你会大声说出来
And at every time you see it, you'll say out loud -

160
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,998
"我喜欢小女孩"
"I like little girls".

161
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,704
下次你去网上找个小女孩的时候
And the next time you go looking for a little girl online.

162
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,798
我要你记住
I want you to remember

163
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:30,686
那段时间你被一条响尾蛇咬了

164
00:17:38,797 --> 00:17:40,217
这很有趣
That is interesting.

165
00:17:50,145 --> 00:17:51,459
打扰一下 小姐？
Excuse me, Miss?

166
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:53,556
小姐？
Miss?

167
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:55,174
小姐 你在剧院里留下了些东西

你知道我查过了
You know I checked.

00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:06,504
3个月内有6个男人的脸颊上有小蛇咬纹身？
Six men in 3 months with those little snake bite tattoos on their cheeks?

201
00:21:07,276 --> 00:21:09,065
我 你一直很忙

你是我见过的最漂亮的女人
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

Oh my God, works a little too well, doesn't it?

209
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,688
这是交易蛇咬安迪
Here's the deal Snakebite Andi.

210
00:21:43,942 --> 00:21:46,918
你是推手 嗯？你可以推人
You are pusher, hm? You can push people.

211
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:49,859
我们这有一阵子没在了
We haven't had a pusher around here for a little while.

212
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:54,650
所以 我要给你一笔交易 我已经近40年没有给过任何人了
So, I'm gonna offer you a deal I haven't offered anyone in almost 40 years.

213
00:21:56,339 --> 00:21:58,193

00:22:01,431 --> 00:22:02,780
十五？

216
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:05,228
哦 上帝 多么大的年龄啊
Oh, God, what an age.

217
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,245
你女人的春天 不是吗？
Springtime of your womanhood, isn't it?

218
00:22:10,948 --> 00:22:15,527
你不再是女孩了 但你也没有一个凹痕
You are not a girl anymore but you don't have a single dent yet either.

219
00:22:16,383 --> 00:22:18,891
重力甚至没注意到你
Gravity hasn't even noticed you.

220
00:22:19,378 --> 00:22:21,184
不是15岁
Not in 15.

221
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,782
男人虽然...

不不不 在没什么可耻的
No, no. no. No shame.

223

你付了钱 是吗？

224
00:22:32,757 --> 00:22:34,274
这就是我给你的

225
00:22:34,442 --> 00:22:36,032
永远的春天
Springtime forever.

226
00:22:36,432 --> 00:22:38,534
十年后 你还是15岁
Ten years from now you are still 15.

227
00:22:38,694 --> 00:22:40,868
一百个？也许17岁
A hundred? Maybe 17.

228
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,157
吃得好
Eat well.

229
00:22:44,382 --> 00:22:48,651
保持年轻 活得长

00:24:01,882 --> 00:24:04,482
没关系 人们喜欢看它

233
00:24:05,296 --> 00:24:07,048
我们过去常在图书馆里设置这个
We used to set this up in the library.

234
00:24:07,444 --> 00:24:10,383
社区项目只是独自夺走了生命
Community project just taken a life on its own.

235
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,362
我们从那儿的一个钟表城开始
We started with a clock town there.

236
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,510
-哦 是的 -只是不断成长
- Oh yeah. - Just keeps growing.

237
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,721
孩子们称它为"小城"
Kids call it "Tiny Town".

238
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,957
孩子们造的？
The kids built this?

239
00:24:18,314 --> 00:24:19,748
有一些帮助 哦 是的

保持下去 建了整个镇广场
Keep it up. Built the whole Town square.

241
00:24:24,515 --> 00:24:28,674
你是下车还是骑在城镇附近？
Are you off the bus, or riding near town?

242
00:24:28,674 --> 00:24:29,748
是的 公共汽车
Yeah, the bus.

243
00:24:30,588 --> 00:24:32,573
在北方这样远的地方 坐公共汽车的人并不多
Not many ride bus this far North.

244
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,853
除非 他们正在寻找工作
Unless, they are looking for work.

245
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,701
是的
Yeah.

246
00:24:40,777 --> 00:24:42,606
改变风景 或者...
Change of scenery, or...

247
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:44,823
你逃避了什么？
You're running away from something?

248
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:48,272
别介意我跳
Don't mind me hop on.

249
00:24:48,615 --> 00:24:50,431
-新面孔 就这些 -是的

250
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,054
所以我想 我离家出走
So I'm running away from myself, I guess.

251
00:24:57,861 --> 00:25:00,724
逃离自己 那是一个泡菜
Running away from yourself, that is a pickle.

252
00:25:02,236 --> 00:25:04,366
无论你走到哪里 你都带着自己
You take yourself with you wherever you go.

253
00:25:04,624 --> 00:25:05,856
那不是婊子吗？
Isn't that the bitch?

254
00:25:08,316 --> 00:25:10,886
租金为每周85美元 预付
Rent's $85 a week, payable upfront.

255
00:25:11,045 --> 00:25:14,240
比利付了你的前两美元 休息给你
Billy paid your first two, rest's on you.

256
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:18,194
没有宠物没有派对无噪音
No pets. No parties. No noise.

257
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:20,024
我是一个安静的时间
I am a quiet time.

258
00:25:20,908 --> 00:25:22,556
最后一个人也这么说
Last guy said the same.

259
00:25:22,797 --> 00:25:24,226
数学学生
Math student.

260
00:25:25,031 --> 00:25:26,992
甚至让他把墙上的黑板都画上去
Even let him paint the wall all blackboard,

261
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,406
这样他就可以在上面涂鸦他的小谜题了
so he could scribble his little puzzles up there.

262
00:25:30,006 --> 00:25:32,057
不安静 不是这样
Wasn't quiet, no so.

263
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:36,048
他离开时连画都没涂上 但我很高兴我没有
Didn't even paint over this when he left. But I'm glad I didn't.

264
00:25:36,224 --> 00:25:38,620
因为我可以为你带来一些简单
'Cause I can make this easy for you.

265
00:25:38,797 --> 00:25:41,135
所以 你每天早上醒来都会看到它
So you see it every morning when you wake.

266
00:25:44,465 --> 00:25:46,915
-你确定要为这小狗担保？ -很肯定
- You sure you wanna vouch for this pup? - Pretty sure.

267
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:49,206
这是你的 比利
It's your ass, Billy.

268
00:25:50,093 --> 00:25:51,547
流血的心脏这一个
Bleeding heart this one.

269
00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:56,885
我在楼下 一楼 如果你需要什么
I'm downstairs, ground floor, if you need anything.

270
00:25:58,004 --> 00:26:00,168
明天找到我 我们再谈一些工作
Find me tomorrow, we'll talk about some work.

271
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:03,416
你为什么要这么做？
Why are you doing this?

272
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:05,522
你不了解我
You don't know me.

273
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:07,417
不 我没有
No I don't.

274
00:26:07,758 --> 00:26:10,083
但我知道这个样 就像我说的
But I know the look, like I said.

275
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,846
有时候我...
And sometimes I...

276
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,370
得到这种对人的感觉 很难理解 我猜
get this feeling about people, hard to understand, I guess.

277
00:26:17,065 --> 00:26:18,525
比你想象的要容易
Easier than you think.

278
00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:21,921
-谢谢 -好吧
- Thanks. - All right.

279
00:26:43,277 --> 00:26:44,464
准备好了吗？
You ready?

280
00:26:47,153 --> 00:26:48,243
她准备好了
She's ready.

281
00:26:53,561 --> 00:26:54,852
这些人是谁？
Who are these people?

282
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:56,566
之后你就会知道的
You'll find out after.

283
00:26:57,619 --> 00:27:00,358
那边是格兰帕・弗利克 他会带领我们
Right over there is Grampa Flick, and he'll lead us.

284
00:27:00,358 --> 00:27:01,597
躺下
Lie down.

她会加入我们吗？

他们还没找到我们

他们习惯于听他哭

310

因为我把他一个人留了这么多

所以他们什么也没做

312

我们的信念不能使我们成为更好的人

我们的行动使我们成为更好的人

在小镇上很少换班 帮助火车

00:34:58,393 --> 00:35:00,057
垂死的人打扰你吗？

我们都快死了
We're all dying.

398

我们都是一个空气清新的大临终关怀中心

00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:02,172
不是现在 是吗？

00:36:02,623 --> 00:36:04,271
感觉好像我快死了
It felt like I was dying.

403

吃饭时你会感觉好些的
You'll feel better when you eat.

406
00:36:11,883 --> 00:36:13,558
我还是人吗？
Am I still human?

407
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:16,976
你在乎吗？
Do you care?

408
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:44,835
嘿
Hey.

409
00:36:45,443 --> 00:36:46,537
随它去
Let it be.

410
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:50,431
阿兹雷尔 离开他吧
Azrael, leave him be.

411
00:37:00,727 --> 00:37:01,778
阿齐兹？
Azzie?

412
00:37:03,453 --> 00:37:04,731
阿齐 来吧
Azzie, come on.

413
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:08,307
来吧 阿齐
Come on, Azzie.

414
00:37:08,718 --> 00:37:09,721
医生？
Doc?

415
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:12,143
是你吗 医生？
Is that you, Doc?

416
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:14,156
不 我不是医生
No, I'm not a doctor.

417
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:16,394
你要我给你找个医生吗？
Do you want me to get you a doctor?

418
00:37:16,589 --> 00:37:17,988
猫在我的床上
The cat's on my bed.

419
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:20,062
-哦 我会把她搬走 -没有

420
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:22,732
我知道她会的
I knew she would be.

421
00:37:23,573 --> 00:37:27,106
那只猫似乎总是知道
That cat always seems to know

422
00:37:29,406 --> 00:37:30,617
当它的时间
when it's time.

423
00:37:32,694 --> 00:37:34,059
我想是时候了
I guess it's time.

424
00:37:34,238 --> 00:37:37,749
不 只是阿齐是个愚蠢的老猫
No, it's just Azzie being a silly old cat.

425
00:37:37,906 --> 00:37:38,906
不
Nope.

426
00:37:40,044 --> 00:37:42,381
自从我来到这里 就一直这样

是时候睡觉了

429
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:49,581
大家都知道
Everybody knows that.

430
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:53,186
我要去.
I'm gonna die.

431
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:05,337
是的
Yes.

432
00:38:06,672 --> 00:38:08,556
-让我给你找个人 -没有
- Let me get you someone. - No.

433
00:38:10,699 --> 00:38:13,361
我知道它就要来了
I've known it was coming.

434
00:38:15,637 --> 00:38:17,773
不会让它不那么可怕
Doesn't make it less scary.

435
00:38:17,988 --> 00:38:18,920
是的
Yeah.

436
00:38:19,437 --> 00:38:21,245
也许就像你说的
Maybe it's just like you say.

437
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:23,470
只是要睡觉了
Just going to sleep.

438
00:38:24,715 --> 00:38:27,730
我是说没什么可怕的 只是睡着了
I mean there's nothing scary, it's just sleeping.

439
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:30,389
你是个奇怪的医生
You are a strange type of doctor.

440
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,293
我说过我不是医生
I told you I'm not a doctor.

441
00:38:32,467 --> 00:38:34,299
我想你是
I think you are.

442
00:38:35,222 --> 00:38:36,833
医生睡眠
Doctor Sleep.

443
00:38:37,366 --> 00:38:40,679
医生 我很害怕会伤害或黑暗
Doc, I am so scared it's gonna hurt or be dark,

444
00:38:40,956 --> 00:38:43,993
或什么都不是 我不想...
or be nothing at all, and I don't wanna...

445
00:38:43,993 --> 00:38:45,791
没什么好害怕的
Nothing to be scared of.

446
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,346
只是要睡觉了
Just going to sleep.

447
00:38:49,777 --> 00:38:54,975
最后 真正的 宁静的睡眠
Finally true, restful sleep.

448
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:00,009
谢谢
Thank you.

449
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,889
谢谢你 医生
Thank you, doc.

450
00:39:04,805 --> 00:39:06,448
听着 我不该在这里
Look, I shouldn't be here.

451
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:08,445
-让我来给你拿点... -不 不 不
- Let me go get you some... - No, no, no.

452
00:39:08,698 --> 00:39:12,101
你正是你应该去的地方
You're exactly where you should be.

453
00:39:14,626 --> 00:39:15,995
完全
Exactly.

454
00:39:20,622 --> 00:39:22,287
我看见我妻子了
I see my wife.

455
00:40:59,442 --> 00:41:01,124
丹 酒鬼
Dan, alcoholic.

456
00:41:01,437 --> 00:41:02,616
嗨 丹
Hi, Dan.

457
00:41:02,947 --> 00:41:04,466
我不太喜欢演讲
I'm not much of a speech guy.

458
00:41:05,423 --> 00:41:07,120
只是想拿芯片
Just thought I'll hold the chip and

459
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,273
谈论什么弹出
talk about whatever popped up.

460
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,749
我在想我爸爸
I'm thinking about my dad.

461
00:41:13,978 --> 00:41:17,185
他5岁时就去世了 所以我唯一了解他的方式
He died when I was 5, so the only way I got to know him,

462
00:41:17,479 --> 00:41:21,681
我真的了解他是当我黑了
I really got to know him was when I went dark.

463
00:41:21,852 --> 00:41:23,849
当我喝酒的时候
When I drank.

464
00:41:24,205 --> 00:41:26,016
来使...
To dull the...

465
00:41:26,534 --> 00:41:27,582
或
Or...

466
00:41:28,598 --> 00:41:30,501
每当我想打破某人的脸
Whenever I wanted to break someone's face.

467
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:34,704
因为喝酒、发脾气和愤怒
'Cause the drinking and the temper and the anger.

468
00:41:35,921 --> 00:41:37,454
我的东西是他的
Those things in me were his.

469
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:39,262
他们都是我所能认识的
And they were all I could know of him.

470
00:41:42,425 --> 00:41:43,707
但现在.
But now.

471
00:41:43,845 --> 00:41:46,598
嗯 现在我了解他有点不同 因为
Well, now I get to know him a little different, 'cause

472
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,426
他也站在这样的房间里一次
he also stood in a room like this once.

473
00:41:51,611 --> 00:41:56,077
想为我好起来 我妈妈
Wanting to get well for me, my mom.

474
00:41:58,033 --> 00:42:01,830
他手里拿着一块芯片 芯片说"5个月"
And he has a chip in his hand, and chip said "5 months".

475
00:42:02,658 --> 00:42:05,135
那天他...
And on that day he...

476
00:42:05,491 --> 00:42:07,112
在一切之前
Before it all.

477
00:42:09,475 --> 00:42:13,371
那一天 他只想站在我现在的站位上
Well, on that day all he wanted in the world was to stand where I'm standing now.

478
00:42:14,862 --> 00:42:16,614
我在这里 所以...
And here I am, so...

479
00:42:18,238 --> 00:42:20,721
所以 谢谢你 我们两个 我想
So, thank you for us both, I guess.

480
00:42:22,151 --> 00:42:23,693
这是给杰克・托伦斯的
This is for Jack Torrance.

481
00:42:41,143 --> 00:42:42,299
嘿 查理
Hey, Charlie.

482
00:42:45,356 --> 00:42:46,324
医生？
Doc?

483
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:54,731
我想我不需要问你为什么这个小时在这里
Guess I don't need to ask why you are here this hour.

484
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,904
你痛吗？
You have pain?

485
00:42:59,073 --> 00:43:01,365
你要我让克劳德特给你带个药丸吗？
Do you want me to get Claudette to bring you a pill?

486
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,340
药丸并不重要
Pill won't matter.

487
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:10,366
我不怕地狱 医生
I'm not scared of Hell, Doc.

488
00:43:10,798 --> 00:43:14,577
我过着体面的生活
I lived a decent life.

489
00:43:15,368 --> 00:43:17,640
无论如何 不要以为有这样一个地方
Don't think there is such a place anyway.

490
00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:20,236
我想我很害怕
I guess I'm scared

491
00:43:22,025 --> 00:43:24,422
什么都没有
there's nothing.

492
00:43:25,229 --> 00:43:26,911
我们不会结束的 查理
We don't end, Charlie.

493
00:43:28,182 --> 00:43:30,261
我知道这一点是肯定的
I know that for certain.

494
00:43:30,435 --> 00:43:32,262
我不太知道 但是
I don't know much else, but

495
00:43:33,766 --> 00:43:36,031
我知道我们不会结束
I know that we don't end.

496
00:43:38,225 --> 00:43:39,852
蓝 莓
Blueberries.

497
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:45,044
我能尝到我妈妈以前种植的蓝莓
I can taste blueberries my mother used to grow.

498
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,428
你能尝尝吗？
Can you taste them?

499
00:43:47,598 --> 00:43:49,618
是的 我可以
Yeah, I can.

500
00:43:51,584 --> 00:43:54,170
我可以通过收音机听到弗兰克的声音
And I can hear Frank over radio.

501
00:43:54,503 --> 00:43:57,897
以前 工具旁边有一个新的工作台
One used to have a new work bench next to your tools.

502
00:43:58,884 --> 00:44:00,830
跟我飞吧
Come fly with me

503
00:44:01,322 --> 00:44:05,004
让我们飞吧 我们飞走了
Let's fly, let's fly away

504
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:09,289
如果你能用一些异国情调的酒
If you can use some exotic booze

505
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:13,016
远孟买有一家酒吧
There's a bar in far Bombay

506
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:15,472
跟我飞吧
Come fly with me

507
00:44:15,616 --> 00:44:19,621
让我们飞翔 让我们飞翔
Let's fly, let's fly

508
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:21,904
离开
Away

509
00:44:32,488 --> 00:44:34,282
一会儿 小笔友
In a minute, little pen pal.

510
00:44:49,929 --> 00:44:51,819
阿布拉 学校
Abra, school.

511
00:44:53,147 --> 00:44:54,961
好吧 我知道
Fine, I know.

512
00:45:13,633 --> 00:45:14,998
嘿 葛兰 你见过罗西吗？
Hey gramps, have you seen Rosie?

513
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,632
t望 塔
Watchtower.

514
00:45:19,689 --> 00:45:21,161
你感觉还好吗？
You feeling okay?

515
00:45:21,692 --> 00:45:23,292
桃子好
Peach okay.

516
00:45:41,855 --> 00:45:42,923
嘿
Hey.

517
00:45:45,084 --> 00:45:46,439
对不起 打扰一下
Sorry to interrupt.

518
00:45:46,637 --> 00:45:47,686
运气好吗？
Any luck?

519
00:45:48,681 --> 00:45:49,685
越来越近了
Getting closer.

520
00:45:50,812 --> 00:45:52,714
我想他在爱荷华州的某个地方
He's somewhere in Iowa, I think.

521
00:45:53,714 --> 00:45:57,318
一旦我确定他找到了 我们都会走一次很长的路程
We'll all take a nice long road trip once I'm sure I found him.

522
00:46:00,363 --> 00:46:02,327
但直到我...
But until I do...

523
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,307
你得打开毒气罐 罗西
You gotta open the canister, Rosie.

524
00:46:05,422 --> 00:46:08,909
我们6个月前就拿了蒸汽 乌鸦 6个月什么都不是
We took steam 6 months ago, Crow, 6 months is nothing.

525
00:46:09,472 --> 00:46:13,104
特拉华州的那个孩子没有那么有蒸汽 而且已经出现了
That kid in Delaware wasn't so steamy and it's already showing.

526
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:15,872
-你看到弗利克爷爷的头发了吗？ -是的
- You see Grandpa Flick's hair, yeah? - Yeah.

527
00:46:16,303 --> 00:46:17,312
我认为他不好
I don't think he's well.

528
00:46:18,237 --> 00:46:20,855
自从尼克松执政以来 弗利克爷爷一直不太好
Grandpa Flick hasn't been well since Nixon was in office.

529
00:46:20,981 --> 00:46:22,373
我知道 但是...
I know, but...

530
00:46:23,215 --> 00:46:26,017
我们需要吃饭 我们所有人
We need to eat, all of us.

531
00:46:27,477 --> 00:46:29,099
还是罐子太低了？
Or the canisters just low?

532
00:46:29,517 --> 00:46:30,382
当然不是
Of course not.

533
00:46:30,382 --> 00:46:34,422
只是没有必要浪费一个 如果你接近一个杀人
Just no need to waste one if you are close to a kill.

534
00:46:36,197 --> 00:46:37,197
罗西
Rosie.

535
00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:40,066
我可能需要它只是为了找到他
I might need it just to find him.

536
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:45,348
我们过去更蒸汽
We used to be more steamy.

537
00:46:45,505 --> 00:46:46,922
别傻了 来吧
Don't be daft, come on.

538
00:46:47,557 --> 00:46:48,454
这就像根说:
That's like a root say:

539
00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:51,029
在50年我成长 人们过去更邻里
in 50 years I grow, people used to be more neighborly.

540
00:46:51,307 --> 00:46:52,574
但这是真的 罗西
But it's true, Rosie.

541
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:54,797
那里蒸汽少了 也变弱了
There's less steam out there and it's weaker too.

542
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:58,222
不知道是他们的手机 饮食或Netflix或什么
Don't know if it's their cell phones, or diets or Netflix or what,

543
00:46:58,222 --> 00:47:00,738
但这些天我没有任何意义
but I am not picking up any sense these days,

544
00:47:00,738 --> 00:47:02,286
一旦我这么做 罗西 他们只是...
and once that I do, Rosie, they are just...

545
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:04,671
今晚我会把罐子打开 把大家紧闭起来
I'll open the canister tonight to tight everyone up.

546
00:47:04,671 --> 00:47:06,184
谢谢
Thank you.

547
00:47:12,387 --> 00:47:14,404
-你知道吗 罗西？ -我知道吗？
- You know what, Rosie? - I know what?

548
00:47:14,716 --> 00:47:15,846
这就是为什么你每天都在这里
It's why you up here every day.

549
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:19,080
这就是为什么你总是在这里 不管你告诉别人什么
It's why you are always up here, no matter what you tell the others.

550
00:47:19,808 --> 00:47:23,348
世界并不太如蒸汽 你正在寻找鲸鱼
The world's not as steamy, and you are looking for a whale.

551
00:48:12,217 --> 00:48:14,075
看这个孩子19号
Watch this kid. Number 19.

552
00:48:14,611 --> 00:48:15,883
那孩子很自然
That kid is a natural.

553
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,372
他每次都击球
He hits the ball every time.

554
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:20,929
就像他能读出投手的思想一样
Like he can read the pitcher's mind.

555
00:48:21,254 --> 00:48:22,521
是吗？
Is that right?

556
00:48:30,654 --> 00:48:31,868
看 你看
See, you watch.

557
00:48:31,998 --> 00:48:33,793
这些天之一 这些天才球探之一
One of these days one of those talent scouts

558
00:48:33,793 --> 00:48:36,480
会把胜利给布莱德那里 你看
is gonna give win to Brad there, you watch.

559
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:00,344
嘿 19岁
Hey, 19.

560
00:49:00,982 --> 00:49:02,904

Just saw your game.

561
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,312

You are ready for the majors.

562
00:49:05,502 --> 00:49:07,088
-玩得很好 -谢谢
- Well played. - Thanks.

563
00:49:07,233 --> 00:49:08,861

564
00:49:09,174 --> 00:49:11,299
你想跳进去 我送你一程
You wanna hop in, I'll give you a ride.

565
00:49:12,423 --> 00:49:14,325
不 非常接近
No, it's real close.

566
00:49:14,692 --> 00:49:15,611
我很好
I'm good.

567
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,262
没关系
It's okay.

568

Yeah.

610

我想是东海岸

你是说有人从1500英里外看的？
You are saying someone looked in from 1500 miles away?

615

也许再远一点
Maybe farther.

616
00:55:58,691 --> 00:55:59,969
男孩还是女孩？
Boy or girl?

但我发誓 乌鸦爸爸

我没有感觉到那样的力量

原始的力量 在这么久

我们需要调查一下吗？

00:56:20,095 --> 00:56:21,848
越快越好
Sooner the better.

624
00:56:22,273 --> 00:56:23,775
孩子的父母吓坏了
Kid's parents freak out.

625
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,228
送她去看精神病医生
Send her to a psychiatrist.

626
00:56:26,515 --> 00:56:29,397
他们给她吃药可能会毁了蒸汽
And they get her on pills. Could ruin the steam.

627
00:56:30,666 --> 00:56:33,062
不 回馈 所以这个孩子就像
No, giving back, so this kid it's like

628
00:56:33,385 --> 00:56:35,923
把一块萨兰包裹在探照灯上
turning a piece of saran wrap over searchlight.

629
00:56:36,262 --> 00:56:37,614
我不知道她在哪儿
I don't know where she is.

630
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,299
但是当她回来的时候 她会回来的
But when she comes back, and she'll be back.

631
00:56:42,506 --> 00:56:44,508
哦 我会准备好的 亲爱的
Oh, I'll be ready, honey.

632

他的名字叫丹
His name is Dan.

638
00:57:58,886 --> 00:58:00,331

很抱歉
Sorry about that.

642
00:58:05,611 --> 00:58:08,756
我知道你的头有时就像收音机
I know that head of yours is like a radio sometimes.

643
00:58:09,303 --> 00:58:13,365
你拿起一些奇怪的车站
And you pick up some weird stations.

644
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:14,718
没有什么奇怪的
Nothing weird like that.

645
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:17,361
不再是了
Not anymore.

00:58:26,487 --> 00:58:27,349

跑步的地方 交给11 然后...
Running place, hand off to 11, and...

649
00:58:34,193 --> 00:58:36,305
如果我...
Coach is gonna kill me if I'm...

650
00:58:37,618 --> 00:58:39,366
为什么他不喜欢我？
Why doesn't he like me?

651
00:58:39,589 --> 00:58:41,419
我的头发？我应该换发型吗？
My hair? Should I change my haircut?

652
00:58:41,419 --> 00:58:42,935
怪物又盯着我看
The freak is staring at me again.

653
00:58:43,128 --> 00:58:44,832

01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:14,062
我不知道 我不在乎
I don't know, I don't care.

我说她很有蒸汽 对吧？

695
01:05:26,849 --> 01:05:28,570
是的 它甚至比那还要大

我试着背弃她
I tried to turn around on her

697
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:33,563
她把我从她身上吹出来 就像我什么都不是一样

我会说那是不可能的

她是食物还是我们把她转过来？

我们不把她转过来

罗西 你确定吗？
Rosie, are you sure?

703
01:05:46,777 --> 01:05:48,172
如果她是你所说的...
If she's what you say she is...

704
01:05:48,172 --> 01:05:50,783
那我们不想要任何比我们更有能力的人
Then we don't want anyone with that power than us.

让我们用我们外面的声音 好吗？
Let's use our outside voices, all right?

712

713
01:07:58,294 --> 01:07:59,732
比我想象的要容易
It was easier than I thought.

714
01:08:00,043 --> 01:08:01,999
比如 GPS 但在我的脑海里
Like, GPS, but in my head.

715
01:08:02,306 --> 01:08:04,461
听着 我不是说任何冒犯 但
Look, I don't mean any offense, but

716
01:08:04,827 --> 01:08:09,048
现在和现在 一个成长中的男人和一个十几岁的女孩坐在公园的长椅上...
this day and age, a grow man sitting with a teenage girl on a park bench...

717
01:08:09,048 --> 01:08:12,127
我是艾布拉・斯通 如果有人问 你是我的叔叔
I'm Abra Stone, and if anyone asks - you are my uncle.

718
01:08:12,273 --> 01:08:13,889
丹叔叔
Uncle Dan.

719
01:08:16,469 --> 01:08:19,309
这甚至不是谎言 不是完全的
And that's not even a lie, not totally.

720
01:08:19,467 --> 01:08:21,467
你魔法 像我一样
You magic, like me.

721
01:08:22,903 --> 01:08:25,124
我不知道魔法
I don't know about magic.

722
01:08:27,433 --> 01:08:28,925
我一直称它为"闪亮的"
I've always called it "the shining".

723
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,745
是的 我们都闪耀
And yeah, we both shine.

724
01:08:32,205 --> 01:08:33,317
你父母知道吗？
Do your parents know?

725
01:08:33,481 --> 01:08:35,629
关于我的光芒？
About my shine?

726
01:08:36,175 --> 01:08:37,907
他们不谈论它
They don't talk about it.

727
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:41,576
或者 如果我使用它 他们看我不同
Or if I use it, they look at me different.

728
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:44,325
当我还是个孩子的时候 我不懂那光芒
When I was a kid I didn't understand the shining.

729
01:08:44,325 --> 01:08:45,866
我叫它"托尼"
I called it "Tony".

730
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:48,323
以为那是我想象中的朋友
Thought it was my imaginary friend.

731
01:08:48,611 --> 01:08:51,141
我以为你是我想象中的朋友
I thought you were my imaginary friend

732
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:53,958
很长一段时间
for a long time.

733
01:08:55,055 --> 01:08:56,827
我们有多少人在那里？
How many of us are out there?

734
01:08:58,724 --> 01:09:00,509
有很多人有一点点的光芒
There are a lot of people who have a little bit of shine,

735
01:09:00,509 --> 01:09:01,879
他们甚至不知道
they don't even know it.

736
01:09:02,232 --> 01:09:04,798
他们似乎总是带着花回家 当他们的妻子伤心时
They always seem to come home with flowers when their wives are sad,

737
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:07,407
或者他们在学校考试中表现很好 他们没有学习
or they do well in the school test they didn't study for.

738
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:11,782
但我一生只见过两三个人 他们知道他们闪闪发光
But I only met 2 or 3 people in my whole life who knew they shined.

739
01:09:14,292 --> 01:09:15,997
那个棒球男孩闪闪发光
The baseball boy shined.

740
01:09:16,707 --> 01:09:18,309
他的名字是布拉德利・特雷弗
His name was Bradley Trevor.

741
01:09:21,555 --> 01:09:23,227
这些人
These people.

742
01:09:24,023 --> 01:09:26,692
他们看起来像人反正 他们带走了他
They look like people anyway, they took him

743
01:09:27,636 --> 01:09:28,979
他们吃了他
And they ate him.

744
01:09:30,891 --> 01:09:32,625
他们吃了他的光芒
They ate his shine.

745
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:34,817
你能感觉到吗？
You could feel it?

746
01:09:35,987 --> 01:09:37,381
他能感觉到我
And he could feel me.

747
01:09:39,386 --> 01:09:40,821
如果你能得到他的东西
If you could get something of his.

748
01:09:40,821 --> 01:09:42,273
如果你能去爱荷华州
If you could go to Iowa.

749
01:09:42,417 --> 01:09:44,102
-不 等等... -我可以帮你找到他
- No, hang on... - I can help you find him.

750
01:09:44,102 --> 01:09:45,673
这样他的父母就会知道他在哪里
That way his parents would know where he was.

751
01:09:45,673 --> 01:09:47,491
他们至少可以把他埋起来
They could bury him right at least.

752
01:09:47,742 --> 01:09:49,201
我们也可以拿他的手套
We could also get his glove.

753
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:52,529
-如果我能触摸手套 我可以追踪他们 -简单 简单
- If I can touch that glove I can track them. - Easy, easy.

754
01:09:52,529 --> 01:09:55,485
因为巴里是块 我想那是他的名字
Because Barry the Chunk, I think that was his name.

755
01:09:55,947 --> 01:09:57,856
有一段时间 在他们杀了他之前
For a while, before they killed him.

756
01:09:58,062 --> 01:09:59,736
他戴着它
He was wearing it.

757
01:10:11,378 --> 01:10:13,796
阿布拉 回家吧
Abra, go home.

758
01:10:14,538 --> 01:10:16,048
别追这些人
Don't chase these people.

759
01:10:16,497 --> 01:10:18,159
不要加重他们
Don't aggravate them.

760
01:10:18,355 --> 01:10:20,796
无论你做什么 都不要吸引他们的注意
Whatever you do, don't attract their attention.

761
01:10:21,661 --> 01:10:23,258
找点东西 什么
Find something, anything.

762
01:10:23,258 --> 01:10:27,148
嗯 几乎任何阻止你的光芒
Well, almost anything to stop that shine of yours.

763
01:10:27,477 --> 01:10:29,599
保持低头 希望上帝 这些人
Keep your head down and hope to God that these people

764
01:10:29,599 --> 01:10:31,499
和他们一样的东西 他们...
and anything like them that they...

765
01:10:31,948 --> 01:10:33,635
他们没看见你
That they don't see you.

766
01:10:34,707 --> 01:10:36,581
如果他们看到你 他们会回来
If they see you they come back.

767
01:10:37,018 --> 01:10:38,991
阿布拉 你听到我说话了吗？
Abra, do you hear me?

768
01:10:39,866 --> 01:10:42,183
他们回来了
They come back.

769
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:46,233
低着头 保持安全
Keep your head down, stay safe.

770
01:10:48,173 --> 01:10:50,106
对不起
I'm sorry.

771
01:11:00,269 --> 01:11:02,145
嘿 阿齐
Hey, Azzie.

772
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:17,342
你今晚的电线被划掉了
You got your wires crossed tonight.

773
01:11:19,849 --> 01:11:21,436
那个房间是空的 阿齐
That room's empty, Azzie.

774
01:11:25,942 --> 01:11:28,476
那个房间里没人
There's no one in that room.

775
01:11:37,621 --> 01:11:39,481
坚持住 医生
Hang on, Doc.

776
01:11:39,838 --> 01:11:40,610
迪克？
Dick?

777
01:11:42,124 --> 01:11:43,682
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

778
01:11:43,974 --> 01:11:46,378
-我以为是... -我以为我是从俯瞰的
- I thought it was... - Thought I was from the Overlook.

779
01:11:47,446 --> 01:11:48,973
差点把我关起来
Almost locked me up.

780
01:11:49,519 --> 01:11:51,916
还在从他们那里得到生意？老鬼？
Still getting business from them old ghosts?

781
01:11:52,184 --> 01:11:53,819
不 不是好几年了
No, not for years.

782
01:11:54,007 --> 01:11:57,229
霍勒斯・德温特是最后一个 他西装上的纸屑
Horace Derwent was the last one, confetti on his suit.

783
01:11:57,392 --> 01:11:59,441
说:"伟大的党 不是吗？
Said: "Great party, isn't it?"

784
01:11:59,441 --> 01:12:02,562
打 他脸上的笑容 直到我掏出盒子给他
Shit, he did a grin on his face till I pulled out box for him.

785
01:12:02,993 --> 01:12:04,391
那笑容就快了
That grin went fast.

786
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:07,924
那时我从没想过要问你
It never occurred me to ask you back then.

787
01:12:08,244 --> 01:12:09,972
那些箱子里会发生什么事？
What happens to them in those boxes?

788
01:12:09,972 --> 01:12:11,372
他们死在那里吗？
Do they die in there?

789
01:12:11,613 --> 01:12:13,191
你在乎吗？
Do you care?

790
01:12:15,511 --> 01:12:16,735
我想你
I missed you.

791
01:12:16,735 --> 01:12:18,512
已经很久了？
Has it been a long time?

792
01:12:19,514 --> 01:12:20,701
说不出来
Can't tell.

793
01:12:21,922 --> 01:12:25,042
这个世界对我来说是一个梦想
This world is a dream of a dream to me now.

794
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,038
八年了 再多一点
Eight years, little more.

795
01:12:28,982 --> 01:12:30,166
你为什么在这里？
Why are you here?

796
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:33,872
我来这里是因为它一切都来了
I'm here because it all comes round.

797
01:12:34,485 --> 01:12:36,485
卡是个轮子 医生
Ka is a wheel, Doc.

798
01:12:37,708 --> 01:12:42,663
如果这些空魔鬼在你是坦克时找到你
If these empty devils ever found you when you were a tank.

799
01:12:42,934 --> 01:12:44,951
如果他们嗅到你
If they'd even sniffed you

800
01:12:45,146 --> 01:12:46,902
你会死很久了
you'd be long dead.

801
01:12:47,582 --> 01:12:52,024
他们吃尖叫和喝痛
They eat screams and drink pain.

802
01:12:52,353 --> 01:12:55,460
他们注意到了那个小女孩
And they've noticed that little girl.

803
01:12:56,435 --> 01:12:58,332
他们可能会杀了她
They might kill her.

804
01:12:59,302 --> 01:13:01,324
可能会把她
Might turn her.

805
01:13:02,530 --> 01:13:06,747
或者可能留着她 直到她都用不着 那可是最糟糕的
Or might keep her, till she's all used up and that'd be worst of all.

806
01:13:06,874 --> 01:13:08,838
你不能让他们
You can't let them.

807
01:13:11,292 --> 01:13:12,626
为什么是我？
Why me?

808
01:13:13,284 --> 01:13:15,212
因为她找到你了
Because she found you.

809
01:13:15,395 --> 01:13:18,616
因为她出现了见鬼 医生 为什么是我？
Because she showed up. Hell, Doc, why me?

810
01:13:19,117 --> 01:13:23,041
有一天你刚走进我的厨房 我还是被钩住了
You just rocked on into my kitchen one day and I'm still on the hook.

811
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:25,560
我到底要怎么做？
What the hell am I supposed to do?

812
01:13:27,249 --> 01:13:29,470
给她买她要求的
Get her what she asked for.

813
01:13:31,795 --> 01:13:34,081
你不会再见我了 医生
You won't see me again, Doc.

814
01:13:34,958 --> 01:13:37,092
这是我最后的梦
This is my last dream.

815
01:13:43,109 --> 01:13:46,310
在我看来 你长大了很好 儿子
It seems to me you grew up fine, son.

816
01:13:46,854 --> 01:13:49,498
但你还是欠了一笔债
But you still owe a debt.

817
01:13:53,821 --> 01:13:55,178
付钱吧
Pay it.

818
01:14:11,448 --> 01:14:12,280
嘿
Hey.

819
01:14:12,436 --> 01:14:13,304
嘿 妈妈
Hey, Mom.

820
01:14:13,424 --> 01:14:14,473
你没事吧？
You're feeling okay?

821
01:14:14,801 --> 01:14:16,044
晚餐时我们想念你
We missed you at dinner.

822
01:14:16,878 --> 01:14:19,599
我很好 只是度过了艰难的一天
I'm okay, just had a rough day.

823
01:14:24,381 --> 01:14:26,735
我早上要飞出去看MoMo
I'm flying out to see MoMo in the morning.

824
01:14:27,178 --> 01:14:29,065
我会尽快回来的
I'll be back as soon as I can.

825
01:14:31,002 --> 01:14:32,809
艾伯斯 她...
Abbs, does she...

826
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:38,733
她这次会挺过难关的？
She's gonna pull through this time?

827
01:14:42,496 --> 01:14:43,808
我不知道
I don't know.

828
01:14:44,976 --> 01:14:46,640
但我希望如此
But I hope so.

829
01:14:47,488 --> 01:14:48,821
告诉她我爱她
Tell her I love her.

830
01:17:32,193 --> 01:17:34,655
继续睡觉 公主
Keep sleeping, princess.

831
01:17:48,061 --> 01:17:50,065
你坐炉
You hobs.

832
01:17:51,343 --> 01:17:54,326
你花了一生的时间 做小盒子
You spend your whole lives, making little boxes.

833
01:17:54,873 --> 01:17:56,434
小小的回忆
Little memories.

834
01:17:58,057 --> 01:18:00,442
你认为他们让你这么富有？
You think they make you so rich?

835
01:18:00,777 --> 01:18:03,139
你应该看看我的 孩子
You should see mine, kiddo.

836
01:18:04,724 --> 01:18:07,762
我的头脑是一座大教堂
My mind's a cathedral.

837
01:18:11,136 --> 01:18:13,543
嗯 你好
Well, hi there.

838
01:18:37,722 --> 01:18:39,316
他说你会回来的
He said you'd come back.

839
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:42,067
而你做到了
And you did.

840
01:18:43,926 --> 01:18:44,846
好
Good.

841
01:18:47,669 --> 01:18:50,014
回去 回来！
Get back, get back!

842
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,835
你只是个该死的孩子
You are just a fucking child.

843
01:18:59,207 --> 01:19:00,207
你在哪里？
Where did you?

844
01:19:00,723 --> 01:19:01,925
哪里...
Where...

845
01:19:01,925 --> 01:19:03,150
你去哪里了？
Where did you go?

846
01:19:03,257 --> 01:19:04,549
你在哪里...
Where did you...

847
01:19:06,637 --> 01:19:07,479
不
No.

848
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:11,524
出去！出去！
Get out! Get out!

849
01:19:11,689 --> 01:19:12,863
出去！
Get out!

850
01:19:58,626 --> 01:19:59,461
玫瑰？
Rose?

851
01:19:59,662 --> 01:20:00,633
陷阱
Trap.

852
01:20:00,988 --> 01:20:02,195
陷阱！
Trap!

853
01:20:02,761 --> 01:20:03,738
到底发生什么事了？
What the hell happened?

854
01:20:04,088 --> 01:20:06,592
-小婊子为我设了个陷阱 -哦 你的手
- Little bitch set a trap for me. - Oh, your hand.

855
01:20:07,236 --> 01:20:08,850
罗斯 冷静点冷静
Rose, calm down. Calm down.

856
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:10,987
我们知道她现在在哪 对吧？现在我们知道了
We know where she is now, right? Now we know.

857
01:20:10,987 --> 01:20:12,455
她在我的脑子里
She was in my head.

858
01:20:12,618 --> 01:20:14,164
-什么？ -偷盗
- What? - Stealing.

859
01:20:14,164 --> 01:20:16,615
-她知道什么？ -我不知道 我不知道
- What does she know? - I don't know, I don't know.

860
01:20:16,764 --> 01:20:18,592
-她看到了多少？ -我不知道！
- How much did she see? - I don't know!

861
01:20:20,559 --> 01:20:21,506
有问题
There's a problem.

862
01:20:21,506 --> 01:20:22,563
不是现在！
Not now!

863
01:20:22,711 --> 01:20:24,390
爷爷弗利克
Grandpa Flick.

864
01:20:24,625 --> 01:20:26,519
我想他在骑自行车
I think he's cycling.

865
01:20:31,844 --> 01:20:33,527
丹叔叔 丹叔叔！
Uncle Dan, Uncle Dan!

866
01:20:33,816 --> 01:20:35,795
我伤害了她我真的伤害了她
I hurt her. I really hurt her.

867
01:20:35,921 --> 01:20:38,012
我伤害了她 她应得的 但这不是最好的部分
I hurt her, and she deserved it, but that's not the best part.

868
01:20:38,139 --> 01:20:40,560
最好的部分是 我得到了她的头
The best part is I got in her head.

869
01:20:40,694 --> 01:20:42,090
我在她的脑袋里
I got in her head.

870
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:45,130
-丹叔叔？ -哦 上帝 阿布拉
- Uncle Dan? - Oh, God, Abra.

871
01:20:45,936 --> 01:20:47,421
你都干了些什么？
What have you done?

872
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:05,031
和孩子谈谈
Just talk to the kid.

873
01:21:06,043 --> 01:21:09,073
如果我们要这样做 那么让我们这样做
If we gonna do this, then let's do this.

874
01:21:12,137 --> 01:21:13,485
嗨 阿布拉
Hi, Abra.

875
01:21:17,055 --> 01:21:18,260
我能听到你说话
I can hear you.

876
01:21:23,035 --> 01:21:24,449
我不明白
I don't understand.

877
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:25,908
你会的
You will.

878
01:21:27,878 --> 01:21:29,742
我以为我们会永远活着
I thought we'll live forever.

879
01:21:30,726 --> 01:21:32,895
有人答应过你吗 安蒂？
Did someone promise you that, Andi?

880
01:21:33,475 --> 01:21:35,765
有人说你是不朽的吗？
Did someone say you're immortal?

881
01:21:37,115 --> 01:21:40,997
我说:"活得长 吃得好"
I said: "live long, eat well".

882
01:21:42,115 --> 01:21:44,070
我们可以活得长 活得长
We can live long, very long.

883
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:46,300
我们做 我们大多数人
And we do, most of us.

884
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,868
但是我们吃得不好
But we haven't been eating well.

885
01:21:50,208 --> 01:21:52,266
很久没有了
Not for a long time.

886
01:21:53,335 --> 01:21:54,934
罗西 他走了
Rosie, he's going.

887
01:21:56,281 --> 01:21:57,615
罗西
Rosie.

888
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:04,612
是的 爱？
Yes, love?

889
01:22:06,023 --> 01:22:09,306
-我很害怕 -不 不是
- I am scared. - No, you are not.

890
01:22:10,723 --> 01:22:14,709
你看着帝国兴衰
You watched empires rise and fall.

891
01:22:15,975 --> 01:22:18,275
在罗马的角斗士们欢呼雀跃
Cheered the gladiators in Rome.

892
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:22,509
横渡海洋到新世界
Sailed across oceans to new worlds.

893
01:22:23,661 --> 01:22:28,588
靠国王、王子和教皇
Fed on kings and princes, and popes.

894
01:22:29,159 --> 01:22:30,846
他们写了你的神话
They wrote myths of you.

895
01:22:31,888 --> 01:22:33,773
并制作了雕像
And made statues.

896
01:22:34,238 --> 01:22:41,321
他们在村庄、床和摩天大楼里颤抖
And they trembled in their villages and beds and skyscrapers.

897
01:22:42,873 --> 01:22:44,450
所以没有
So no.

898
01:22:45,503 --> 01:22:47,765
你不害怕
You are not scared.

899
01:22:49,647 --> 01:22:51,224
你是个国王
You're a king.

900
01:22:52,347 --> 01:22:54,804
你吃恐惧
And you eat fear.

901
01:23:46,462 --> 01:23:47,318
嘿 兄弟
Hey, bro.

902
01:23:48,282 --> 01:23:49,274
凌晨4点
It's 4 AM.

903
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:50,795
你总是看见我 比利
You've always seen me Billy.

904
01:23:51,301 --> 01:23:54,497
你对人很有感觉 这么说公平吗？
You have a good sense about people, is that fair to say?

905
01:23:55,068 --> 01:23:55,712
是的 但为什么？
Yeah, but why?

906
01:23:55,712 --> 01:23:57,996
你以为我是个诚实的人 一个好人？
You think I'm an honest man, a good man?

907
01:23:58,285 --> 01:23:59,791
是的 是的 丹
I do, I do, Dan.

908
01:23:59,791 --> 01:24:00,984
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

909
01:24:01,306 --> 01:24:03,151
但我首先需要你听一个故事
But first thing I need is for you to listen to a story

910
01:24:03,282 --> 01:24:06,644
比你试图相信我更努力
and try harder than you've ever tried to believe me.

911
01:24:22,988 --> 01:24:24,065
事情进行的怎么样了？
How is it going?

912
01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:27,904
嗨 你不该准备上学吗？
Hi, shouldn't you be getting ready for school?

913
01:24:28,164 --> 01:24:30,621
是的 但是我想跟着
Yeah, but I wanted to tag along.

914
01:24:30,811 --> 01:24:32,117
你开了多久了？
How long have you been driving?

915
01:24:32,285 --> 01:24:33,534
几个小时左右
For few hours or so.

916
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:35,944
我们今晚应该晚到
We should get there tonight late.

917
01:24:38,397 --> 01:24:39,448
那是谁？
Who's that?

918
01:24:40,014 --> 01:24:41,310
那是我的朋友
That's my friend.

919
01:24:42,311 --> 01:24:44,003
也许我最好的朋友
Maybe my best friend.

920
01:24:45,444 --> 01:24:47,125
你应该看到她的脸
You should've seen her face.

921
01:24:47,283 --> 01:24:49,084
她很害怕 丹叔叔
She was scared, Uncle Dan.

922
01:24:49,233 --> 01:24:51,043
像所有的孩子一样害怕
Scared like all those kids were scared.

923
01:24:51,233 --> 01:24:52,694
她杀的那些孩子
All those kids she's killed.

924
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:55,276
她太生气了 太害怕了 我都上不去
She was so mad and so scared that I got in.

925
01:24:56,139 --> 01:24:57,261
那是个新把戏
That was a new trick.

926
01:24:57,674 --> 01:24:59,173
我以前从没做过
I've never done that before.

927
01:24:59,529 --> 01:25:01,575
是的 我也不是 感觉怎么样？
Yeah, me neither. What was it like?

928
01:25:02,104 --> 01:25:03,370
就像图书馆一样
Like a library.

929
01:25:03,702 --> 01:25:05,853
我想我们都是里面的图书馆
I guess we're all libraries inside.

930
01:25:06,831 --> 01:25:08,240
你干的是谁干的？
Who did you do it?

931
01:25:08,384 --> 01:25:11,051
像这样 只是一点点推
Like this, just a little push.

932
01:25:15,791 --> 01:25:16,694
打开！
Abra!

933
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:18,632
对不起 对不起
Sorry, sorry.

934
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:26,609
-对不起 我不是故意的 -没事的
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. - It's okay.

935
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:28,943
那些箱子是什么？
What were all those boxes?

936
01:25:29,285 --> 01:25:30,211
什么
Nothing.

937
01:25:30,211 --> 01:25:31,422
骗子
Liar.

938
01:25:34,733 --> 01:25:36,033
当我还是个孩子的时候
When I was a kid,

939
01:25:37,277 --> 01:25:39,987
比你小 我碰到了类似这些东西的东西
younger than you I bumped into something like these things,

940
01:25:40,561 --> 01:25:42,776
像他们一样吃了
that ate like they do.

941
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:45,294
但它不是一个人 而是一个地方
But it wasn't a person, it was a place.

942
01:25:46,813 --> 01:25:50,272
他们关闭了它后 让它腐烂
They closed it downafter and let it rot.

943
01:25:51,482 --> 01:25:53,715
但是那些住在那里的东西...
But the things that lived there, these...

944
01:25:55,987 --> 01:25:57,711
别再去那里闲逛了
Don't go poking around there again.

945
01:25:58,171 --> 01:26:01,512
好 我不会的 我保证
Okay. I won't, I promise.

946
01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:16,205
我们差不多准备好了 我们只是 装载
We are almost ready, we are just, loading up.

947
01:26:16,302 --> 01:26:17,385
好
Good.

948
01:26:17,768 --> 01:26:20,679
我们在路上把车队弄到了 一两天后就把她弄到了
We got the caravan on the road, and we'll have her in a day or two.

949
01:26:20,679 --> 01:26:22,555
我认为你不应该来 罗西
I don't think you should come, Rosie.

950
01:26:24,233 --> 01:26:26,066
你刚才说的是什么？
The fuck did you just say?

951
01:26:26,066 --> 01:26:28,615
她攻击了你 她在你的脑袋里
She attacked you, she got in your head.

952
01:26:28,799 --> 01:26:29,984
是的 不会再发生了
Yeah, it won't happen again.

953
01:26:29,984 --> 01:26:32,370
谁知道在你把她踢出去之前她得到了多少？
And who knows how much she got to before you kicked her out?

954
01:26:32,524 --> 01:26:33,867
她是我的 克劳
She's mine, Crow.

955
01:26:33,867 --> 01:26:37,695
现在 据我们所知 你是我们中唯一她能追踪的人
Right now as far as we know you are the only of us she could track.

956
01:26:37,909 --> 01:26:39,780
现在 她看到你来了...
Now, she sees you coming...

957
01:26:39,954 --> 01:26:41,275
她能跑
She could run,

958
01:26:41,449 --> 01:26:43,688
或设置另一个陷阱
or set another trap.

959
01:26:46,961 --> 01:26:49,400
你知道我是对的
You know I'm right about this.

960
01:26:50,496 --> 01:26:52,146
如果她捉弄你
If she pulls a trick on you.

961
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:56,170
-是吗？ -是的
- Yeah? - Yeah.

962
01:26:56,515 --> 01:26:58,452
但我有我自己的一些技巧
But I got some tricks on my own.

963
01:27:06,968 --> 01:27:08,290
是的 我想我们在这里
Yeah, I think we're here.

964
01:27:11,363 --> 01:27:12,253
好
Okay.

965
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,459
看看我能否抓住她
Will see if I can get her.

966
01:27:16,862 --> 01:27:17,900
打开？
Abra?

967
01:27:19,364 --> 01:27:20,597
那是标志
That's the sign.

968
01:27:20,957 --> 01:27:22,075
退后一下
Pull around back.

969
01:27:22,418 --> 01:27:23,788
她说要退后一把
She says to pull around back.

970
01:27:23,919 --> 01:27:27,293
-我会告诉你什么时候停下来 -她会告诉我们什么时候停下来
- And I'll tell you when to stop. - She'll tell us when to stop.

971
01:27:33,151 --> 01:27:34,543
我该怎么告诉你 我不知道
How do I tell you, I don't know.

972
01:27:34,543 --> 01:27:37,712
我不知道我希望你是正确还是错误
I don't know whether I hope you're right or wrong about this.

973
01:27:37,712 --> 01:27:41,591
我是说如果你错了 我的朋友是疯了
I mean if you are wrong - my friend is crazy.

974
01:27:41,591 --> 01:27:43,318
我的意思是全面
I mean full-blown

975
01:27:44,064 --> 01:27:48,892
心理崩溃假想怪物杀死假想的孩子
mental breakdown imaginary monsters killing imaginary kids

976
01:27:49,388 --> 01:27:50,296
疯狂
bonkers.

977
01:27:50,837 --> 01:27:53,062
但是 你知道的 我可以这样做
But, you know. I can work with that.

978
01:27:54,452 --> 01:27:56,451
-如果你是对的 -我知道
- If you're right though. - I know.

979
01:27:57,437 --> 01:27:58,693
更糟
So much worse.

980
01:28:13,313 --> 01:28:14,588
你应该回家
You should go home.

981
01:28:14,748 --> 01:28:16,193
什么？
What?

982
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:17,806
不 不是你
No, not you.

983
01:28:18,814 --> 01:28:20,002
我能处理
I can handle it.

984
01:28:20,114 --> 01:28:21,091
不
No.

985
01:28:21,619 --> 01:28:23,136
我们从这里开始
We'll take it from here.

986
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,433
好吧 只有我们
Okay, it's just us.

987
01:28:44,498 --> 01:28:46,333
你闻到了吗？
You smell that?

988
01:28:48,775 --> 01:28:51,206
我过去常打猎 我跟你说过吗？
I used to hunt, did I ever tell you that?

989
01:28:51,206 --> 01:28:52,367
不
No.

990
01:28:52,538 --> 01:28:53,503
鹿
Deer.

991
01:28:54,171 --> 01:28:55,485
这个夏天
This one summer.

992
01:28:56,574 --> 01:28:57,886
我点击了这个降压
I clicked this buck.

993
01:28:58,552 --> 01:29:00,351
我跟踪他2天
I was tracking him for 2 days.

994
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:02,506
我中枪了
I got the shot.

995
01:29:02,683 --> 01:29:06,002
他点击他 他跑掉了 我走了
Clicked him, he ran off, I went after.

996
01:29:06,532 --> 01:29:09,440
想一下 他不会持续太久的
Figured, he wasn't gonna last long.

997
01:29:11,882 --> 01:29:12,920
他消失了
And he vanished.

打开 蒸发

999
01:29:16,772 --> 01:29:19,459
没有痕迹 真的令人费解

1000
01:29:22,156 --> 01:29:23,217
五天后

1001
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:26,253
我在尝试一个在数英里之外的地方

1002
01:29:26,563 --> 01:29:30,238
我四处寻找盲人的点

然后我闻到了他

闻到他的味道
Smelled him.

1005
01:29:37,005 --> 01:29:38,464
找到了那块钱
Found that buck.

1006
01:29:38,929 --> 01:29:40,956
托起一个空心的树干
Held up to a hollow trunk.

1007
01:29:42,105 --> 01:29:43,768
死了几天
Dead for days.

1008
01:29:45,127 --> 01:29:46,346
气味
The smell.

1009
01:29:47,837 --> 01:29:49,999
从那以后 一天也没打猎过
Never hunted a day since.

1010

这是同样的气味

比利
Billy.

1012
01:30:32,122 --> 01:30:33,314
哦 我的上帝！

他妈的
Fuck.

1015
01:31:07,389 --> 01:31:09,906
妈的 丹尼尔！搞什么？！
Fuck, Daniel! What the fuck?!

1016
01:31:09,967 --> 01:31:12,354
他们甚至没有深深地埋葬他 他们把他埋在浅层
They didn't even bury him deeply. They buried him shallow.

1017
01:31:12,606 --> 01:31:14,067
对不起 比利
I'm sorry, Billy.

1018
01:31:15,210 --> 01:31:17,316
你让我们进入什么？
What did you get us into?

1019
01:31:25,450 --> 01:31:26,913
做那的人
The people who did that.

1020
01:31:27,077 --> 01:31:29,054
他们不是人
They are not people.

1021
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:32,118
不 不 他们不是
No, no they ain't.

1022
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:35,086
谁愿意对一个小男孩那样做
Who would wanna do that to a little boy.

1023
01:31:35,530 --> 01:31:36,803
他们不是人

1024

是的 我们拿到了
Yeah, we got it.

1026
01:31:40,266 --> 01:31:41,295

我们停下来了
We got a stop to make.

1029
01:31:47,531 --> 01:31:49,848

-是的 -没有
- Yeah. - No.

1032
01:31:52,772 --> 01:31:54,377
他们几乎认为我很正常
They almost think I'm normal.

1033
01:31:54,546 --> 01:31:55,730
如果我告诉他们 他们会...
If I tell them, they'll...

1034
01:31:55,730 --> 01:31:57,387
罗斯会通过他们来接近你
Rose will go through them to get to you.

1035
01:31:57,530 --> 01:31:58,887
你知道的 不是吗？
You know that, don't you?

1036
01:31:59,030 --> 01:32:00,935
她不用再三考虑就把它们砍下来
She'll cut them down without a second thought.

1037
01:32:00,935 --> 01:32:02,907

1038

1039
01:32:09,988 --> 01:32:11,551
那我们要阻止什么？
So what's the stop we gotta make?

1040

你还有那些老鹿步枪吗？

I'm gonna kick your ass before I call the police, huh?

1047
01:32:41,319 --> 01:32:42,831
-嘿 -不 不 开门

1048
01:32:43,001 --> 01:32:44,150
别说她的名字！
Don't you say her name!

1049
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:45,160

可能得在下一个休息点给你服药

我是杀死你朋友的人

别以为罗斯会太高兴 如果你拍奖？
Don't imagine Rose would be too happy if you shoot the prize?

1216
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:39,598
我不认为罗斯会为此而高兴
I don't suppose Rose would be happy about any of this.

1217

嗯 那好吧

数你的祝福 继续你的方式
Count your blessings, go on your way.

有什么好笑的 朋友？
What's so funny, friend?

1222

真的很傲慢

But, makes sense if you think you gonna live forever.

1225
01:48:02,656 --> 01:48:04,247
站得住

为什么选择科罗拉多州？

她会一直来的
She's gonna keep coming.

This only ends if we end her and I don't think we can beat her.

-饥饿的地方？ -是的 没错
- Hungry place? - Yes, that's right.

1251
01:52:09,437 --> 01:52:12,600
如果太危险了 我们为什么要去那里？
If it's so dangerous, why would we go there?

1252

如果对我们这样的人很危险

I don't want you spending a minute inside there if you don't have to.

她只能从这里来
She can only come from here.

1274

你会看到她英里外 容易

你看到那边山上的灯光
You see lights on the mountain over there

1276

杰克・丹尼尔斯
Jack Daniels.

1289
02:01:49,121 --> 02:01:51,191
我过去常在我们家看到瓶子
I used to see the bottles in our home.

1290
02:01:51,581 --> 02:01:53,418
在这一切之前 我们真正的家
Our real home before all this.

1291
02:01:55,010 --> 02:01:58,742
我闻到一次 它闻起来像火的东西 这
I smelled one once, it smelled like something on fire, which

1292
02:01:59,441 --> 02:02:01,520
我想是的
I suppose it was.

1293
02:02:02,136 --> 02:02:04,505
恐怕你把我和别人搞混了
I'm afraid you've confused me with someone else.

1294

我道歉 托伦斯先生

我不知道每个人都在哪里 但它会回升
I don't know where everyone is, but it will pick up.

1298
02:02:15,579 --> 02:02:17,331
哦 我知道他们在哪儿

你是对的
And you are right.

1300

它会拿起
It'll pick up.

1301

如果你不介意我说 托伦斯先生 你似乎

1303
02:02:29,239 --> 02:02:30,387
放上？
Put upon?

1304
02:02:30,893 --> 02:02:32,718
陷入别人的问题
Pulled into other people's problems.

1305
02:02:32,718 --> 02:02:35,882
如果你不介意我说的话 我一直都能看到
I see it all the time, if you don't mind my saying.

1306
02:02:38,331 --> 02:02:40,211
所以我们住在佛罗里达
So we lived in Florida.

1307
02:02:41,514 --> 02:02:42,401
对不起？
I'm sorry?

1308

妈妈和我.
Mom and I.

1309
02:02:45,723 --> 02:02:48,420
我们再也不想看到雪了
We never wanted to see snow again.

1310
02:02:48,801 --> 02:02:50,627
所以我们住在佛罗里达
So we lived in Florida.

1311
02:02:50,881 --> 02:02:53,617
小地方 但它是舒适的 我们很高兴
Tiny place, but it was comfortable and we were happy.

1312
02:02:55,684 --> 02:02:57,542
她死的时候我20岁
I was 20 when she died.

1313
02:02:58,053 --> 02:02:59,231
那时候
And back then,

1314
02:02:59,939 --> 02:03:02,738
我看到有人要死的时候 我看见苍蝇
I saw when someone was gonna die I saw flies,

1315
02:03:03,174 --> 02:03:05,598
黑苍蝇 我称之为死苍蝇
black flies, death flies I called them,

1316
02:03:05,598 --> 02:03:07,836
盘旋人们的脸
circling people's faces.

1317
02:03:08,039 --> 02:03:10,572
在最后一次醒来时 她被遮住了
And in those last wakes she was covered.

1318
02:03:10,727 --> 02:03:14,808
她的整张脸我几乎看不见她的眼睛
Her whole face. I could barely see her eyes.

1319
02:03:15,850 --> 02:03:20,648
我试着安慰她 但我几乎看不中她
And I tried to comfort her, but I could hardly look at her.

1320
02:03:20,984 --> 02:03:22,665
她看到了
And she saw that.

1321
02:03:28,109 --> 02:03:31,934
也许更可以推开这些不愉快的事情？
Maybe something more to push away such unpleasantries?

1322
02:03:31,934 --> 02:03:34,902
你不想听吗？她是你妻子
Don't you wanna hear about it? She was your wife.

1323
02:03:34,902 --> 02:03:37,827
我想你把我误认为是别人了
I think you've mistaken me for someone else.

1324
02:03:38,024 --> 02:03:40,034
-我只是个调酒师 -哦 是吗？
- I'm just a bartender. - Oh, yeah?

1325
02:03:41,408 --> 02:03:44,657
只是劳埃德酒保 在俯瞰酒店倾注喜悦？
Just Lloyd the Bartender, pouring joy at the Overlook hotel?

1326
02:03:44,657 --> 02:03:47,538
我会倾注任何你喜欢的 托伦斯先生
I'll pour whatever you like, Mr. Torrance.

1327
02:03:54,559 --> 02:03:56,085
男人喝一杯
Man takes a drink.

1328
02:03:57,485 --> 02:03:59,007
一杯饮料就喝
A drink takes the drink.

1329
02:04:00,047 --> 02:04:01,997
然后 饮料需要一个男人
And then the drink takes a man.

1330
02:04:02,971 --> 02:04:04,413
不是吗 爸爸？
Isn't it so, Dad?

1331
02:04:08,781 --> 02:04:10,641
医学
Medicine.

1332
02:04:11,734 --> 02:04:14,144
医学就是它
Medicine is what it is.

1333
02:04:14,650 --> 02:04:16,760
善意的关心
Bona fide cura.

1334
02:04:17,402 --> 02:04:20,036
头脑是一块黑板
The mind is a blackboard,

1335
02:04:20,215 --> 02:04:21,406
和这个
and this

1336
02:04:22,010 --> 02:04:23,603
是橡皮擦
is the eraser.

1337
02:04:28,843 --> 02:04:30,694
一个男人尝试
A man tries.

1338
02:04:31,108 --> 02:04:32,108
他提供
He provides.

1339
02:04:33,475 --> 02:04:35,479
但他包围了我的嘴
But he's surrounded my mouths.

1340
02:04:36,038 --> 02:04:37,731
并且有家人
And has family.

1341
02:04:38,069 --> 02:04:40,792
妻子 孩子
A wife, a kid.

1342
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:43,079
那些嘴咬时间
Those mouths eat time.

1343
02:04:43,871 --> 02:04:45,886
他们在地球上吃你的日子
They eat your days on Earth.

1344
02:04:46,402 --> 02:04:48,402
把他吞没了
It is gobbled him up.

1345
02:04:50,016 --> 02:04:52,561
这足以让一个人生病
It's enough to make a man sick.

1346
02:04:53,707 --> 02:04:55,040
和这个
And this

1347
02:04:55,741 --> 02:04:57,606
是药
is the medicine.

1348
02:04:59,828 --> 02:05:01,718
告诉我 小狗
So tell me, pup.

1349
02:05:02,835 --> 02:05:05,497
你要吃药吗？
Are you gonna take your medicine?

1350
02:05:09,757 --> 02:05:11,050
我不是
I'm not.

1351
02:05:13,769 --> 02:05:14,482
丹
Dan.

1352
02:05:14,934 --> 02:05:16,000
她在这
She's here.

1353
02:05:34,188 --> 02:05:35,912
好
Okay.

1354
02:05:49,981 --> 02:05:52,204
这个地方病了
This place is sick.

1355
02:05:52,665 --> 02:05:54,939
像我的莫莫病一样生病
Sick like my MoMo was sick.

1356
02:05:55,178 --> 02:05:56,277
是癌症
It's cancer.

1357
02:05:56,965 --> 02:05:58,038
只是更糟
Only worse.

1358
02:06:06,477 --> 02:06:07,529
我们现在怎么办？
What do we do now?

1359
02:06:07,798 --> 02:06:09,982
我们会进去的 她会找到我们的
We'll get inside, she'll find us.

1360
02:07:59,915 --> 02:08:02,416
好 好 好
Well, well, well.

1361
02:08:04,009 --> 02:08:05,068
嘿 你好
Hi there.

1362
02:08:05,787 --> 02:08:08,447
当它启动 -运行
When it starts - run.

1363
02:08:09,009 --> 02:08:11,632
是的 你跑 亲爱的
Yes, you run, dear.

1364
02:08:11,910 --> 02:08:14,074
然后我会找到你
And then I will find you,

1365
02:08:14,370 --> 02:08:19,322
你会尖叫多年 直到你死
and you will scream for years until you die.

1366
02:08:20,297 --> 02:08:22,231
我们看看是谁在尖叫
We'll see who does the screaming.

1367
02:08:22,884 --> 02:08:24,404
我们确实会看到
We'll see indeed.

1368
02:08:24,663 --> 02:08:25,941
她是对的 你知道的
She's right, you know.

1369
02:08:26,728 --> 02:08:28,571
你应该害怕
You should be afraid.

1370
02:08:29,515 --> 02:08:31,136
为什么？
Why is that?

1371
02:08:31,770 --> 02:08:33,925
因为你不知道你站在哪里
Because you don't know where you're standing.

1372
02:08:34,493 --> 02:08:37,417
对不起 你是谁 帅哥？
I'm sorry, who are you, handsome?

1373
02:08:41,007 --> 02:08:44,297
是你杀了我的乌鸦 是吗？
You are the one who killed my Crow, aren't you?

1374
02:08:45,645 --> 02:08:46,737
去！
Go!

1375
02:09:48,028 --> 02:09:49,242
聪明
Clever.

1376
02:09:50,344 --> 02:09:52,293
你做了一些改进 是吗？
You've made some improvements, haven't you?

1377
02:09:53,643 --> 02:09:55,982
自从我上次在你心里
Since the last time I was in your mind.

1378
02:09:56,281 --> 02:09:58,801
你怎么知道我们不是你的？
How do you know we are not in yours?

1379
02:10:12,847 --> 02:10:14,179
你在哪里 小狗？
Where are you, pup?

1380
02:10:34,839 --> 02:10:36,167
你会死在这里
You gonna die here.

1381
02:10:38,138 --> 02:10:39,646
勇敢的话 亲爱的
Brave words, dear.

1382
02:10:40,641 --> 02:10:42,371
你才这么想吗？
Is that what you really think?

1383
02:10:42,836 --> 02:10:45,232
你要伤害我？
You gonna hurt me?

1384
02:10:45,470 --> 02:10:46,378
是的
Yes.

1385
02:10:53,470 --> 02:10:56,761
你知道 你让我想起我自己
You know, you remind me of myself.

1386
02:10:58,373 --> 02:10:59,904
我现在真的可以看到了
I can really see it now.

1387
02:11:00,699 --> 02:11:02,949
亲爱的 你的黑暗
You've got a darkness in you, dear.

1388
02:11:03,246 --> 02:11:06,705
但我认为你和我之间唯一的区别是时间
But I think the only difference between you and me is time.

1389
02:11:16,321 --> 02:11:17,830
你还不知道
You don't know yet

1390
02:11:18,730 --> 02:11:19,944
你做什么
what you do

1391
02:11:20,626 --> 02:11:21,696
更多的时间
for more time.

1392
02:11:23,450 --> 02:11:27,134
但答应你 亲爱的哦 你会惊讶的
But promise you, dear. Oh, you'd be surprised.

1393
02:11:32,319 --> 02:11:34,322
疼痛净化蒸汽
Pain purifies steam.

1394
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:39,404
恐惧 所以...你明白
Fear too, so... You understand.

1395
02:11:58,904 --> 02:12:01,394
我年轻的时候就和你一样
I was just like you when I was younger.

1396
02:12:01,799 --> 02:12:03,295
如此特别
So special

1397
02:12:04,228 --> 02:12:05,363
和单独
and alone.

1398
02:12:05,751 --> 02:12:08,731
但我遇到了一个送我礼物的人――社区的目的
But I met someone who gave me the gift  - the purpose of community.

1399
02:12:08,731 --> 02:12:10,824
我可能给了你这么一份礼物
And I might've given you such a gift,

1400
02:12:10,824 --> 02:12:13,822
如果事情会有所不同的话
if things would've gone differently.

1401
02:12:16,917 --> 02:12:18,111
不？
No?

1402
02:12:18,924 --> 02:12:20,687
反对 不是吗？
Defying, aren't you?

1403
02:12:21,833 --> 02:12:26,253
很像我 你的头脑是如此...
So much like me, your mind it's so...

1404
02:12:29,014 --> 02:12:31,097
这不是你的头脑 对吗？
This isn't your mind, is it?

1405
02:12:33,710 --> 02:12:36,079
这根本不是你
This isn't you at all.

1406
02:12:37,603 --> 02:12:40,058
你只是诱饵？
You're just the bait?

1407
02:12:43,455 --> 02:12:44,898
足够！
Enough!

1408
02:12:47,725 --> 02:12:48,584
运行！
Run!

1409
02:12:51,162 --> 02:12:53,538
我们怎么会想你？
How the hell did we miss you?

1410
02:12:56,697 --> 02:12:59,112
我和我几年前就该见面了
You and I should've met years ago.

1411
02:13:02,819 --> 02:13:03,786
丹尼？
Danny?

1412
02:13:04,953 --> 02:13:07,524
那是你的名字 不是吗？
That's your name, isn't it?

1413
02:13:08,895 --> 02:13:12,017
嗯 当你的润滑油变老时 蒸汽会出事
Well, something happens to the steam when your lubes get older.

1414
02:13:12,444 --> 02:13:13,913
它被污染了
It gets polluted,

1415
02:13:14,711 --> 02:13:16,165
脏
dirty.

1416
02:13:16,305 --> 02:13:17,369
你知道吗？
You knew that?

1417
02:13:18,650 --> 02:13:20,789
我看到你全在油污
I see the grease all over you.

1418
02:13:21,666 --> 02:13:24,404
你的光芒并不完全一样
You don't shine quite the same.

1419
02:13:24,532 --> 02:13:27,083
我猜 长大后会破坏这一点
Growing up spoils that, I guess.

1420
02:13:29,119 --> 02:13:30,745
说真的 帅哥
Seriously, handsome.

1421
02:13:31,340 --> 02:13:33,798
你躲到哪里去了？
Where have you been hiding?

1422
02:13:36,878 --> 02:13:38,523
我可以给你报价
I can make you an offer.

1423
02:13:40,095 --> 02:13:41,717
我很少提出这个提议
An offer I rarely make.

1424
02:13:41,882 --> 02:13:44,142
哦 是的？我等不及了
Oh, yeah? I can't wait.

1425
02:13:44,467 --> 02:13:46,067
这么有天赋的男孩
Such a gifted boy,

1426
02:13:46,369 --> 02:13:49,664
隐藏他的光在丛林下这么久
hiding his light under bushwa for so long.

1427
02:13:50,398 --> 02:13:53,903
你可以活得很长 也活得很好
You can live a long long time, live well too.

1428

1432
02:14:05,366 --> 02:14:07,835
你一定很孤独 做最后一个

1433
02:14:08,174 --> 02:14:09,815
我是说世界上最后一个

1434
02:14:10,375 --> 02:14:12,680
亲爱的 我不是最后一个 离它很远
Sweetie, I'm not the last, far from it.

1435
02:14:14,081 --> 02:14:15,609
我只是最漂亮的

1436
02:14:15,971 --> 02:14:17,690
我想你知道我的答案

1437
02:14:19,607 --> 02:14:20,898
可惜
Pity.

1438
02:14:20,944 --> 02:14:22,271
那么 我们是否这样做？
So, are we doing this or not?

1439
02:14:43,246 --> 02:14:44,627
哦 亲爱的
Oh, sweetie.

1440
02:14:45,739 --> 02:14:47,669
哦 看那个吧？
Oh, look at that, huh?

1441
02:14:49,410 --> 02:14:52,338
我好像已经挖了你的动脉
I seem to have nicked your Femoral artery there.

1442
02:14:53,348 --> 02:14:55,280
你要流血致死吗？
You gonna bleed to death, huh?

1443
02:15:01,699 --> 02:15:03,724
我的 你脾气多
My my, what a temper you have.

1444

1445
02:15:05,806 --> 02:15:07,082
这么浪费！
Such a waste!

1446
02:15:07,660 --> 02:15:08,864
或者也许不是
Or maybe not.

1447
02:15:16,341 --> 02:15:17,288
哦 该死的
Oh, damn.

1448
02:15:18,610 --> 02:15:19,979
即使在你这个年龄
Even at your age.

1449
02:15:20,808 --> 02:15:22,606
太好了
It's so good.

1450
02:15:27,708 --> 02:15:29,760
你尝起来像威士忌
You taste like whiskey.

1451
02:15:35,183 --> 02:15:36,169
丹尼！
Danny!

1452
02:15:37,283 --> 02:15:38,343
丹尼男孩！

02:15:58,372 --> 02:15:59,467
哦 该死的
Oh, damn.

1458
02:16:03,926 --> 02:16:05,837
什么 不是孤独的吗？
What, are not alone in there?

1459
02:16:07,688 --> 02:16:08,820
你在隐瞒什么？
What are you hiding, huh?

1460
02:16:11,288 --> 02:16:12,396
那些是什么？
What's in those?

1461
02:16:12,971 --> 02:16:14,263
特别的东西 嗯？
Something special, huh?

1462
02:16:15,332 --> 02:16:16,730
它们并不特别
They are not special.

1463

他们正在挨饿

1464

02:16:28,395 --> 02:16:29,654
不！
No!

1466
02:17:07,356 --> 02:17:09,356
你好 丹尼

Forever

1469
02:17:17,340 --> 02:17:18,855
永远

1470
02:17:20,014 --> 02:17:21,900
和永远
and ever.

1471
02:17:56,273 --> 02:17:57,374
丹叔叔？
Uncle Dan?

1472
02:17:58,708 --> 02:18:00,424
丹叔叔 完成了吗？
Uncle Dan, is it done?

1473
02:18:01,367 --> 02:18:02,784
她死了吗？
Is she dead?

1474
02:18:24,683 --> 02:18:26,607
很棒的派对 不是吗？
Great party, isn't it?

1475
02:18:27,096 --> 02:18:28,214
打开！
Abra!

1476
02:18:32,145 --> 02:18:33,374
打开！
Abra!

1477
02:18:49,967 --> 02:18:51,580
打开！
Abra!

1478
02:18:57,650 --> 02:18:59,254
打开！
Abra!

1479
02:19:17,676 --> 02:19:18,714

1480
02:19:21,958 --> 02:19:23,359
你在这儿
There you are.

1481
02:19:23,643 --> 02:19:24,643
打开
Abra.

1482
02:19:26,013 --> 02:19:27,962
你一直很坏
You've been very very bad.

1483
02:19:28,553 --> 02:19:29,888
你不是丹叔叔
You are not Uncle Dan.

1484
02:19:30,851 --> 02:19:33,702
你是一个面具 一张假脸
You are a mask, a false face.

1485
02:19:35,101 --> 02:19:36,355
我还能是谁？
Who else could I be?

1486
02:19:36,642 --> 02:19:39,426
你是酒店 但他还在那里
You're The Hotel, but he's still in there.

1487
02:19:39,426 --> 02:19:41,352
面具关闭然后
Mask off then.

1488
02:19:46,017 --> 02:19:47,518
你为什么笑？
Why are you smiling?

1489
02:19:48,094 --> 02:19:50,121
因为你不知道你站在哪里
Because you don't know where you're standing.

1490
02:19:51,674 --> 02:19:53,926
我知道这些大厅就像我自己的脸 孩子
I know these halls like my own face, child.

1491
02:19:54,227 --> 02:19:56,358
我是说你站在那具尸体里
I mean the body you're standing in.

1492
02:19:56,542 --> 02:19:57,907
你穿的脸
The face you're wearing.

1493
02:19:58,282 --> 02:20:00,376
那是丹・托伦斯 你不认识他
That's Dan Torrance, and you don't know him.

1494
02:20:00,423 --> 02:20:01,996
丹・托伦斯？
Dan Torrance?

1495
02:20:02,280 --> 02:20:03,562
丹・托伦斯
Dan Torrance.

1496
02:20:03,727 --> 02:20:06,604
他一到这儿就停了一站
Made one stop as soon as he got here -

1497
02:20:06,746 --> 02:20:08,277
锅炉房
to the boiler room.

1498
02:20:34,157 --> 02:20:35,352
你在这儿
There you are.

1499
02:20:36,681 --> 02:20:38,044
你应该跑的
You were supposed to run.

1500
02:20:38,566 --> 02:20:40,164
我不想离开你
I didn't wanna leave you.

1501
02:20:43,015 --> 02:20:45,556
我正好是我应该去的地方
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

1502
02:20:46,760 --> 02:20:49,507
我再也撑不下去了 阿布拉 你需要跑
I can't hold it off for much longer, Abra, you need to run.

1503
02:20:49,658 --> 02:20:50,314
不！
No!

1504
02:20:50,627 --> 02:20:52,152
没有你我哪儿也不去
I'm not going anywhere without you.

1505
02:20:52,646 --> 02:20:54,854
我必须关上我们身后的门 对吗？
I have to close the door behind us, right?

1506
02:20:56,029 --> 02:20:57,315
跑 跑！
Run, run!

1507
02:23:11,897 --> 02:23:12,936
来吧 丹叔叔
Come on, Uncle Dan.

1508
02:23:13,571 --> 02:23:14,966
离开那里
Get out of there.

1509
02:23:16,139 --> 02:23:17,643
加油
Come on.

1510
02:23:28,970 --> 02:23:31,244
火势迅速蔓延
The fire spread fast,

1511
02:23:31,542 --> 02:23:32,940
摧毁酒店
destroying the hotel.

1512
02:23:33,592 --> 02:23:34,835
净化它
Purifying it.

1513
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:37,791
我几乎能听见
I could almost hear it

1514
02:23:38,616 --> 02:23:39,876
尖叫
screaming.

1515
02:23:40,972 --> 02:23:42,744
我能听到它死去
I could hear it dying,

1516
02:23:43,480 --> 02:23:46,188
和内心深处我知道
and deep inside I knew.

1517
02:23:49,035 --> 02:23:50,958
我知道你没事
I knew you were okay.

1518
02:23:52,237 --> 02:23:54,300
很抱歉 我把你置于危险之中
I'm sorry I put you in danger.

1519
02:23:55,265 --> 02:23:56,786
这是唯一的办法
It was the only way.

1520
02:23:57,598 --> 02:23:58,605
我知道
I know.

1521
02:24:00,100 --> 02:24:03,259
你认为她是对的吗？
Do you think she was right,

1522
02:24:03,424 --> 02:24:05,793
当她说她不是最后一个？
when she said she wasn't the last one?

1523
02:24:06,699 --> 02:24:08,836
世界是饥饿的地方
The world's the hungry place.

1524
02:24:09,011 --> 02:24:10,691
一个黑暗的地方
A dark place.

1525
02:24:11,617 --> 02:24:14,553
也许还有更多的人 或者像他们一样的东西 或者更糟的 但是...
Maybe there're more of them, or things like them or worse, but...

1526
02:24:15,375 --> 02:24:17,824
也有更多的人像你一样
There are more people like you too.

1527
02:24:17,957 --> 02:24:19,616
站着的人

1528
02:24:23,236 --> 02:24:24,847
我告诉你们 当我第一次见到你
I told you, when I first met you

1529
02:24:24,847 --> 02:24:27,623
我告诉你应该躲起来
I told you that you should hide.

1530
02:24:29,159 --> 02:24:31,020
你应该低着头
That you should keep your head down.

1531
02:24:32,295 --> 02:24:34,016
把你的光芒放在视线之外
Keep your shine out of sight.

1532
02:24:36,192 --> 02:24:37,428
但我错了
But I was wrong.

1533
02:24:40,802 --> 02:24:43,112
闪亮 阿布拉・斯通

1534
02:24:45,562 --> 02:24:46,805

晚餐准备好了

1536
02:24:54,923 --> 02:24:56,776
你在跟谁说话？
Who were you talking to?

1537
02:24:58,737 --> 02:24:59,716
没人
No one.

1538
02:25:07,849 --> 02:25:09,004
那不是真的
That's not true.

1539
02:25:13,296 --> 02:25:14,787
我在和丹说话
I was talking to Dan.

1540
02:25:22,722 --> 02:25:25,041
我们继续 之后
We go on, after.

1541
02:25:25,630 --> 02:25:26,777
我们继续
We go on.

1542
02:25:27,473 --> 02:25:29,126
他没事
And he's okay.

1543
02:25:29,865 --> 02:25:31,026
爸爸也是

02:25:32,493 --> 02:25:34,034
他真的是
He really is.

02:25:37,779 --> 02:25:39,245
好
Good.

1546
02:25:50,661 --> 02:25:52,190
你来了 甜心？
You're coming, sweetheart?

1547
02:25:54,666 --> 02:25:55,955
一会儿就来
