Where you going, Violet?

3
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:49,381
Just to pick some flowers.

4
00:00:49,468 --> 00:00:51,426
Don't wander too far.

Well, hi there.

11
00:01:26,374 --> 00:01:27,854
Do you want one?

12
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,953
You're wondering why
I'm wearing such a funny hat.

13
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:43,957
I always wear this hat.

14
00:01:44,044 --> 00:01:46,699
So much,
it's a part of my name now.

15
00:01:46,786 --> 00:01:48,440
My friends,

16
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:50,398
my very, very best friends,

17
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,966
they just call me
Rose the Hat.

18
00:01:53,053 --> 00:01:56,013
It looks like
a magician's hat.

19
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,797
It is.

20
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,408
It's a magic hat.

21
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,496
Do you wanna see?

22
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:04,935
Nothing up my sleeves.

23
00:02:06,675 --> 00:02:08,808
Nothing in my hat.

24
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,160
Don't worry, that's my friend.

25
00:02:13,247 --> 00:02:14,683
You're missing the trick.

26
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,685
Reach inside.

27
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:22,996
Wow!

28
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,258
It's so pretty.

29
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:25,999
Because it's special.

30
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:28,088
And speaking of special,

31
00:02:28,175 --> 00:02:30,264
you're a little magic, too,
aren't you?

32
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:35,008
The flower in my hand,
what color is it?

33
00:02:37,663 --> 00:02:38,751
Purple.

34
00:02:44,713 --> 00:02:45,932
Violet,

35
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,239
like you.

36
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:52,721
You don't eat flowers.

37
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:54,114
But you do.

38
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:56,377
But these are special.

39
00:02:56,464 --> 00:03:00,338
Honey, it's the special ones
that taste best.

40
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,256
I should get back to my mom.

41
00:03:05,343 --> 00:03:08,215
No, stay. Stay awhile.
See more magic.

42
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:15,005
-Ow.
-You are a special

43
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:16,571
little thing, aren't you?

44
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:04,565
No, no, no. Please.

45
00:06:08,874 --> 00:06:11,094
Hey. It's okay, Doc.

46
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:14,097
It's okay.

47
00:06:19,624 --> 00:06:21,104
There.

48
00:06:21,191 --> 00:06:22,844
All dry.

49
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,588
What happened?

50
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:32,767
You have to talk to me, Danny.

51
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:36,510
You haven't talked
since we left...

52
00:06:37,816 --> 00:06:39,818
Please, Doc.

53
00:06:41,472 --> 00:06:43,300
Please.

54
00:06:57,052 --> 00:06:58,967
So,

55
00:06:59,054 --> 00:07:01,535
you ain't talking, huh, Doc?

56
00:07:05,974 --> 00:07:09,282
Weren't talking much
first time I met you neither.

57
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:14,244
You remember the first time
we really talked?

58
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:17,943
When I spoke up
inside your head?

59
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,206
Made you feel good, right?

60
00:07:20,293 --> 00:07:22,904
Knowing you weren't alone.

61
00:07:22,991 --> 00:07:25,864
Someone did that for me, too.

62
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:30,129
And some day, Danny Torrance,
you'll teach someone else.

63
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,435
I won't.

64
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:33,611
Oh, you won't, huh?

65
00:07:33,698 --> 00:07:35,221
I won't shine, I mean.

66
00:07:35,308 --> 00:07:38,746
No more. It's dangerous.

67
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,358
Reckon it is sometimes.

68
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:43,011
She found me.

69
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:45,710
She'll come back and come back
until she gets me.

70
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:48,408
You're right.

71
00:07:48,495 --> 00:07:50,802
The Overlook's condemned.
Boarded up.

72
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:52,543
They're starvin' old ghosts,

73
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,632
and they're reachin' out
for you.

74
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:56,764
Won't stop with her, either.

75
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,549
Pictures in a book.

76
00:07:58,636 --> 00:08:00,507
You said they were just
pictures in a book

77
00:08:00,594 --> 00:08:01,682
and they couldn't hurt me.

78
00:08:04,424 --> 00:08:06,470
Some things,

79
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:10,648
dark things,
the shining's like food.

80
00:08:10,735 --> 00:08:12,519
The Overlook,

81
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:16,349
it was always just pictures
to me.

82
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:19,744
But I didn't shine like you.

83
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:23,008
Nobody shines like you.

84
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:25,228
So, you in that damn hotel,

85
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:27,839
you was like
a million-watt battery

86
00:08:27,926 --> 00:08:29,362
all plugged in.

87
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:31,582
And it ate it up.

88
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:36,804
World's a hungry place.

89
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,719
And the darkest things
are the hungriest,

90
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:40,808
and they'll eat what shines.

91
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,334
Swarm it like mosquitoes
or leeches.

92
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:46,901
Can't do nothing about that.

93
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:51,210
What you can do

94
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,822
is turn what they come for
against 'em.

95
00:08:57,651 --> 00:09:00,393
My grandfather,

96
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,353
he was a mean son of a bitch.

97
00:09:04,484 --> 00:09:05,964
Dark inside.

98
00:09:06,051 --> 00:09:08,749
Same type of dark as your dad.

99
00:09:08,836 --> 00:09:11,665
Beat me senseless,
and my grandma, too,

100
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:13,972
and when he died, I danced.

101
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:16,583
But he kept on coming back.

102
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:20,108
Standing in my room.

103
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:22,894
Suit all gray and stinkin'

104
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:26,898
from whatever mold was growin'
on him in that box.

105
00:09:26,985 --> 00:09:28,682
So, Grandma,

106
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:33,992
she taught me a trick.

107
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,389
Gave me a present.

108
00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:43,001
I want you to know this box

109
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:45,743
inside and out.

110
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,137
Don't just look at it.
Touch it.

111
00:09:49,224 --> 00:09:52,271
Stick your nose inside
and see if there's a smell.

112
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,099
Why?

113
00:09:54,186 --> 00:09:57,711
Because you're gonna build one
just like it in your mind.

114
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,844
One even more special.

115
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:02,325
So next time
that bitch comes around,

116
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:04,457
you'll be ready.

117
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:07,591
Let's get you back to Mama.

118
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,420
Danny!

119
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:12,335
Danny!

120
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:16,861
Danny!

121
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:18,950
There you are.

122
00:10:19,037 --> 00:10:21,213
Where did you go, huh?

123
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,086
You scared me half to death.

124
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,482
Don't you do that to me.
You hear?

125
00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:32,006
Don't you ever do that to me.

126
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:34,052
Don't ever do that to me.

127
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:43,888
Eh, what's up, Doc?

128
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:45,716
-What's the bit?

129
00:10:45,803 --> 00:10:48,849
-What's cookin'?

130
00:10:48,936 --> 00:10:52,070
What's cooking,
little friend? Why, you are.

131
00:10:52,157 --> 00:10:53,288
Me?

132
00:10:53,376 --> 00:10:55,987
Why, yes.

133
00:10:58,119 --> 00:11:00,861
Ouch!
You're killing me!

134
00:11:02,385 --> 00:11:03,429
Ouch!

135
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:11,785
Agony! Agony!

136
00:11:50,345 --> 00:11:51,956
Let me see now.

137
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:55,089
It is obvious that this
is no ordinary rabbit.

138
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:56,743
Therefore, I must dream up

139
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,267
a brilliant master strategy,
ingenious...

140
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:00,573
You okay, Doc?

141
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,402
Now, what if I lured him...

142
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,491
-Yeah, Mom. I'm okay.
-...into a rock crusher?

143
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:07,667
Nah, nah, nah,
too complicated.

144
00:12:07,754 --> 00:12:11,715
Yeah, yeah, too
complicated. But what if I...

145
00:12:11,802 --> 00:12:13,368
Too much detail.

146
00:12:13,456 --> 00:12:15,370
Right.
Too much detail.

147
00:12:34,694 --> 00:12:35,695
And what's your name

148
00:12:35,782 --> 00:12:37,131
-again, cutie?
-Dan.

149
00:12:37,218 --> 00:12:39,351
Dan.

150
00:13:14,604 --> 00:13:18,782
You're gonna take
your medicine.

151
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:19,870
Get off him.

152
00:13:19,957 --> 00:13:21,567
Get up. Get out of here.

153
00:13:21,654 --> 00:13:24,048
Shit.
I think you killed him.

154
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:26,180
What if you killed him?

155
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:27,747
I hope you killed him.

156
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:29,488
You hear me?

157
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:32,535
Let me kiss it better.

158
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:43,807
No, no, no.

159
00:13:43,894 --> 00:13:46,331
No, no, no.

160
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:49,682
Whoa. What the... No.

161
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:15,142
Mommy?

162
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,327
-Mommy?
-Baby.

163
00:14:26,414 --> 00:14:28,634
Here, here.

164
00:14:35,032 --> 00:14:37,948
You can
put her money back, Doc.

165
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:40,341
You can do that much.

166
00:14:40,428 --> 00:14:42,430
She took mine.

167
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:44,607
She probably bought
the coke with it.

168
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,826

Henri wants us
to finish this bottle

175
00:15:25,082 --> 00:15:26,779
-and then three more.
-Andi?

176
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:27,475
Says he'll water his garden
with champagne...

177
00:15:27,562 --> 00:15:29,173
That's right.

178
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,175
...before he'll let
the Germans drink it.

179
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:32,480
This sort of takes the
sting out of being occupied.

180
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:34,265
You're prettier
than your picture.

181
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:35,266
-Doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
- You said it.

182
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:37,485
And you're older than yours.

183
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,361
Are we staying here
or going somewhere?

184
00:15:45,798 --> 00:15:47,713
Don't you wanna
watch the movie?

185
00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:02,597
I don't see
what the fuss is about.

186
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:03,903
Chat room romance.

187
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,514
Little gross. Not interesting.

188
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:09,517
Just watch.
It's interesting, I promise.

189
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:10,649
Well, it better be,

190
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,477
'cause she's not
all that steamy.

191
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:15,393
And there she goes.

192
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,482
Aren't you tired?

193
00:16:18,788 --> 00:16:20,485
Sleep.

194
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,498
Okay.

195
00:16:39,852 --> 00:16:42,768
Wait. This is the best part.

196
00:16:42,855 --> 00:16:44,378
I watched her do it
three times now

197
00:16:44,465 --> 00:16:45,423
and it never gets old.

198
00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:48,992
Sleep deeper,

199
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,864
deep as you can.

200
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:55,346
The pain you feel
is only a dream.

201
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,656
You can explain
a lost wallet

202
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:04,616
when your wife asks.

203
00:17:04,703 --> 00:17:07,227
But you can't explain this.

204
00:17:08,185 --> 00:17:09,882
This you'll see

205
00:17:09,969 --> 00:17:13,190
every day
when you look in the mirror.

206
00:17:13,277 --> 00:17:15,758
And every time you see it,

207
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:18,630
you'll say out loud...

208
00:17:19,544 --> 00:17:21,459
"I like little girls."

209
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:27,030
And the next time
you go looking

210
00:17:27,117 --> 00:17:29,206
for a little girl online,

211
00:17:29,293 --> 00:17:32,426
I want you to remember
that time

212
00:17:32,513 --> 00:17:35,865
you got bitten
by a rattlesnake.

213
00:17:43,786 --> 00:17:45,700
-That is interesting.
-Mmm-hmm.

214
00:17:55,232 --> 00:17:57,495
Excuse me, miss?

215
00:17:57,582 --> 00:18:00,237
Miss. Miss, you left something
in the theater.

216
00:18:00,324 --> 00:18:01,325
You wanna leave me alone.

217
00:18:08,593 --> 00:18:11,509
Well, hi there.

218
00:18:12,379 --> 00:18:13,816
You wanna let me go.

219
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,689
Oh, no, sweetie.

220
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,866
No, I don't.

221
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,004
Mommy, I made this for you.
It's a secret card.

222
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:14,224
Thank you, Abba-doo.

223
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:17,096
Does anyone know a magic word?

224
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:20,665
Hmm. You.

225
00:19:20,752 --> 00:19:22,188
Abracadabra.

226
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:24,016
Abracadabra.
That's a great one.

227
00:19:24,103 --> 00:19:26,932
-One, two, three.
- Two, three.

228
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:30,544
- Abracadabra.

229
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:32,416
I know magic, too.

230
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:33,983
Sometimes, if I...

231
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:37,421
-Sorry.

232
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:39,771
Has anyone seen my spoons?

233
00:19:39,858 --> 00:19:41,512
I can do that.

234
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:43,296
That's nice, sweetie.

235
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:44,384
- They're on you!
- Oh, they're on me?

236
00:19:50,434 --> 00:19:52,001
What the hell?

237
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:02,533
Dave...

238
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:16,895
Abracadabra.

239
00:20:53,758 --> 00:20:54,846
Oops.

240
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:56,891
Well, hi there, sleepyhead.

241
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:58,589
Sorry.

242
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:01,026
I had to sleep you
pretty hard.

243
00:21:01,113 --> 00:21:02,985
You're a tough one.

244
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:04,508
Willful.

245
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:06,336
You know, I checked.

246
00:21:06,423 --> 00:21:09,034
Six men in three months

247
00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:12,255
with those little snakebite
tattoos on their cheeks.

248
00:21:12,342 --> 00:21:14,257
Why, you've been busy.

249
00:21:20,785 --> 00:21:24,658
Snakebite Andi,
that's who you are.

250
00:21:24,745 --> 00:21:27,009
So, who am I?

251
00:21:29,272 --> 00:21:32,231
You're some crazy bitch
who kidnapped me.

252
00:21:32,318 --> 00:21:33,972
Just the truth from now on.

253
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,366
You will only speak the truth.

254
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,111
You're the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen.

255
00:21:42,198 --> 00:21:43,547
My God.

256
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:46,028
Works a little too well,
don't it?

257
00:21:46,115 --> 00:21:48,856
Here's the deal,
Snakebite Andi.

258
00:21:48,943 --> 00:21:52,556
You're a pusher. Hmm?
You can push people.

259
00:21:52,643 --> 00:21:55,863
We haven't had a pusher
around here for a little while

260
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,214
so I'm gonna offer you a deal
I haven't offered anyone

261
00:21:58,301 --> 00:22:01,347
in almost 40 years.

262
00:22:01,434 --> 00:22:04,133
How old are you, darlin'?

263
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,483
Fifteen.

264
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,311
Fifteen?

265
00:22:08,398 --> 00:22:11,618
Oh, God, what an age.

266
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,708
Springtime of your womanhood,
isn't it?

267
00:22:14,795 --> 00:22:15,970
Mmm.

268
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:17,755
You're not a girl anymore,

269
00:22:17,842 --> 00:22:21,454
but you don't have
a single dent yet either.

270
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,501
Gravity hasn't even
noticed you.

271
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:26,416
Not at 15.

272
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,071
Men, though...

273
00:22:30,376 --> 00:22:31,943
No, no, no. No shame.

274
00:22:33,423 --> 00:22:37,775
You paid that back,
didn't you?

275
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:41,518
That's what I'm offering you.
Springtime forever.

276
00:22:41,605 --> 00:22:43,781
Ten years from now,
you're still 15.

277
00:22:43,868 --> 00:22:46,305
A hundred, maybe 17.

278
00:22:48,002 --> 00:22:49,482
Eat well,

279
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:53,965
stay young, live long.

280
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:05,254
You like it?

281
00:24:05,341 --> 00:24:06,951
Oh. Sorry. I was just--

282
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,259
That's okay.
People love to look at it.

283
00:24:10,346 --> 00:24:12,391
We used to set this up
in the library.

284
00:24:12,478 --> 00:24:15,612
Community project, just taking
a life all its own.

285
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:17,831
See, we started with
the clock tower there.

286
00:24:17,918 --> 00:24:19,659
- Oh, yeah.
-Just keeps growing.

287
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,835
Kids call it Teenytown.

288
00:24:21,922 --> 00:24:23,359
The kids build this?

289
00:24:23,446 --> 00:24:24,969
With some help, oh, yeah.

290
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:27,841
Keep it up,
build the whole town square.

291
00:24:29,713 --> 00:24:33,760
Are you off the bus
or riding your thumb?

292
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,197
Yeah, the bus.

293
00:24:35,284 --> 00:24:37,808
Oh. Not many ride the bus
this far north.

294
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:41,115
Unless they're looking
for work.

295
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:44,858
Yeah.

296
00:24:45,946 --> 00:24:47,948
Change of scenery,

297
00:24:48,035 --> 00:24:50,429
or you running away
from something?

298
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,693
Don't mind me.
I hope I'm...

299
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,825
New face is all.

300
00:24:54,912 --> 00:24:56,435
Yeah.

301
00:24:56,522 --> 00:24:59,438
Guess I'm running away
from myself, I guess.

302
00:25:00,222 --> 00:25:02,876
Oh, yeah.

303
00:25:02,963 --> 00:25:06,663
Running away from yourself.
That is a pickle.

304
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,448
You take yourself
with you wherever you go.

305
00:25:09,535 --> 00:25:13,409
-Ain't that the bitch?
- Mmm-hmm.

306
00:25:13,496 --> 00:25:14,801
Rent's 85 a week,

307
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,281
payable up front.

308
00:25:16,368 --> 00:25:19,632
Billy paid your first two,
rest's on you.

309
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:23,462
No pets, no parties, no noise.

310
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:26,073
-I'm a quiet tenant.

311
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,252
Last guy said the same.
Math student.

312
00:25:30,339 --> 00:25:32,123
Even let him paint the wall
all blackboard,

313
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,169
so he could scribble his
little puzzles up there.

314
00:25:35,257 --> 00:25:37,998
Wasn't quiet. No, sir.

315
00:25:38,085 --> 00:25:39,957
Didn't even paint over this
when he left,

316
00:25:40,044 --> 00:25:41,393
but I'm glad he didn't

317
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,830
'cause I can make this easy
for ya,

318
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,876
so you see it every morning
when you wake.

319
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:51,142
You sure you wanna vouch
for this pup?

320
00:25:51,229 --> 00:25:52,578
Pretty sure.

321
00:25:52,665 --> 00:25:54,101
It's your ass, Billy.

322
00:25:55,102 --> 00:25:57,061
Bleedin' heart, this one.

323
00:25:59,629 --> 00:26:02,980
I'm downstairs, ground floor,
if you need anything.

324
00:26:03,067 --> 00:26:05,678
Find me tomorrow,
talk about some work.

325
00:26:07,158 --> 00:26:09,291
Why are you doing this?

326
00:26:09,378 --> 00:26:10,814
You don't know me.

327
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:12,772
No, I don't.

328
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:15,601
But I know the look,
like I said.

329
00:26:15,688 --> 00:26:19,213
And sometimes I get
this feeling about people.

330
00:26:19,301 --> 00:26:21,041
Hard to understand, I guess.

331
00:26:22,173 --> 00:26:24,001
Easier than you think.

332
00:26:25,524 --> 00:26:27,265
-Thanks.
-All right.

333
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,722
You ready?

334
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:53,596
She's ready.

335
00:26:58,905 --> 00:27:00,254
Who are these people?

336
00:27:00,342 --> 00:27:02,866
You'll find out after.

337
00:27:02,953 --> 00:27:04,781
That over there
is Grampa Flick,

338
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:06,913
and he'll lead us.
Lie down.

339
00:27:07,523 --> 00:27:09,002
There.

340
00:27:13,267 --> 00:27:16,967
No fear.
You understand?

341
00:27:25,149 --> 00:27:27,673
We are the True Knot

342
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,849
and we endure.

343
00:27:32,243 --> 00:27:34,288
We are the chosen ones.

344
00:27:36,465 --> 00:27:39,468
We are the fortunate ones.

345
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,692
What is tied cannot be untied.

346
00:27:49,478 --> 00:27:52,045
Here is a woman.

347
00:27:52,132 --> 00:27:53,873
Would she join us?

348
00:27:55,701 --> 00:28:00,750
Would she tie
her life to our life?

349
00:28:00,837 --> 00:28:01,881
Yes.

350
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:03,535
Yes.

351
00:28:03,622 --> 00:28:06,582
Say yes.

352
00:28:07,757 --> 00:28:09,193
Yes.

353
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,589
This one's special.

354
00:28:13,676 --> 00:28:15,286
Her name's Violet.

355
00:28:15,373 --> 00:28:16,983
There's not much of her left.

356
00:28:18,507 --> 00:28:20,509
And she tastes...

357
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:24,730
like flowers.

358
00:28:46,273 --> 00:28:48,319
Breathe deep.

359
00:28:56,327 --> 00:28:59,765
-There. Embrace it.

360
00:29:02,638 --> 00:29:04,466
Embrace it.

361
00:29:14,301 --> 00:29:17,043
No!

362
00:29:18,828 --> 00:29:21,961
No! No!

363
00:30:08,617 --> 00:30:11,097
They haven't found us yet.

364
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:15,145
They were used to
hearing him cry

365
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:17,713
'cause I left him alone
so much.

366
00:30:20,498 --> 00:30:22,326
So they didn't do anything.

367
00:30:25,372 --> 00:30:28,114
And they haven't found us yet.

368
00:30:35,513 --> 00:30:37,080
- Mommy?

369
00:30:57,361 --> 00:30:59,624
Oh, hey.

370
00:30:59,711 --> 00:31:02,888
Uh, you said
that you knew my look.

371
00:31:02,975 --> 00:31:04,586
Well, what did you mean?

372
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:07,980
You're sick.

373
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:10,417
You're tired.
I can see that much.

374
00:31:12,506 --> 00:31:14,117
I need help.

375
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,688
Come on in.

376
00:31:19,775 --> 00:31:21,254
We'll talk about it.

377
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:26,433
God, grant me the serenity

378
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,262
to accept the things
I cannot change,

379
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:31,569
the courage
to change the things I can

380
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,354
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

381
00:31:34,441 --> 00:31:36,313
Well, Bobbie's got
a big birthday today.

382
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,793
Three years.
Three years sober.

383
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,229
- Yeah.

384
00:31:41,318 --> 00:31:42,972
Thanks, John.

385
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:44,713
Well, now for the most
important person in the room.

386
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,629
Is, uh, anybody here a newbie?

387
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,633
Somebody got 24 hours?

388
00:31:54,374 --> 00:31:55,375
Yeah.

389
00:32:03,209 --> 00:32:04,689
New to town, huh?

390
00:32:04,776 --> 00:32:06,212
Yeah, I, uh...

391
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,692
Nothing personal.

392
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:08,954
I delivered half the people
in the room.

393
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:09,955
Just new faces pop,
that's all.

394
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:11,130
This here is Dan Torrance.

395
00:32:11,217 --> 00:32:13,002
-He's fresh off the bus.
-Oh, hey.

396
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:15,613
Fresh off the ground,
by the look.

397
00:32:16,222 --> 00:32:17,441
Oh.

398
00:32:17,528 --> 00:32:19,399
There's no judgment here,
brother.

399
00:32:19,486 --> 00:32:20,749
I mean, we've all been there.

400
00:32:20,836 --> 00:32:22,794
-And worse, trust me.
-Oh, yeah.

401
00:32:22,881 --> 00:32:25,101
If you're looking
for a wing to climb under,

402
00:32:25,188 --> 00:32:26,319
I can't say
you'll do any better

403
00:32:26,406 --> 00:32:28,278
than Billy Freeman here.

404
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:30,715
Thank you
for your hospitality. I...

405
00:32:31,629 --> 00:32:34,110
I'm a little, uh...

406
00:32:34,197 --> 00:32:36,155
I guess I'm not used to it.

407
00:32:36,242 --> 00:32:38,027
Well, you know we say,

408
00:32:38,114 --> 00:32:39,724
"You can't judge someone till
you know their whole story."

409
00:32:39,811 --> 00:32:41,117
You might think
you understand,

410
00:32:41,204 --> 00:32:43,902
-but you don't.
-You don't.

411
00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:45,382
So, how are you today?
All right?

412
00:32:45,469 --> 00:32:46,775
Train's still running.

413
00:32:46,862 --> 00:32:48,777
That's good to hear.

414
00:32:48,864 --> 00:32:49,995
You good?

415
00:32:50,082 --> 00:32:52,389
Yeah. Yeah.

416
00:32:52,476 --> 00:32:53,695
Well, good to know you, Dan.

417
00:32:53,782 --> 00:32:55,044
-Yeah.
-Come again.

418
00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:56,262
-Thanks.
-Hope to see you again soon.

419
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,787
I'll come back, yeah.

420
00:32:58,874 --> 00:33:01,572
Really good man.
He's got a gift...

421
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:03,356
Yeah. Hey, Billy, hang on.

422
00:33:03,443 --> 00:33:05,141
Hey, Doc.

423
00:33:06,795 --> 00:33:09,580
Your watch. Uh...

424
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:12,670
You lost your watch. You were
worried about the kid with...

425
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,628
Goocher's.

426
00:33:16,152 --> 00:33:17,806
What?

427
00:33:17,893 --> 00:33:21,897
The kid with Goocher's
or Gaucher's. The bone thing.

428
00:33:24,551 --> 00:33:26,292
Gaucher's disease.

429
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,077
Right.

430
00:33:28,164 --> 00:33:29,469
You were washing your hands
in the hospital bathroom

431
00:33:29,556 --> 00:33:31,167
and you left it
on the soap dispenser.

432
00:33:34,344 --> 00:33:36,912
Well, just check
on the soap dispenser.

433
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:39,131
-It's good to meet you.
-Yeah.

434
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,747
How did you know?

435
00:33:47,052 --> 00:33:49,098
I wish I could say. Uh...

436
00:33:50,577 --> 00:33:52,101
Lucky guess.

437
00:33:54,973 --> 00:33:56,366
My ass.

438
00:33:57,323 --> 00:33:58,890
Intuition, I suppose.

439
00:33:58,977 --> 00:34:01,197
Like a feeling in my gut.
Maybe a...

440
00:34:02,981 --> 00:34:04,896
A lucky guess.

441
00:34:04,983 --> 00:34:06,811
What do you wanna do here?

442
00:34:08,204 --> 00:34:09,553
What do you mean?

443
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,469
I mean here in Frazier.
Why are you here?

444
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:16,429
I don't know. I don't know.

445
00:34:16,516 --> 00:34:19,955
Something different
than I've been doing.

446
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,262
Something better.

447
00:34:26,613 --> 00:34:28,311
You go to church?

448
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:30,487
Does it matter?

449
00:34:30,574 --> 00:34:32,576
Do you believe in something?
Something...

450
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,014
bigger than you?

451
00:34:38,016 --> 00:34:41,150
Our beliefs
don't make us better people.

452
00:34:41,237 --> 00:34:43,674
Our actions
make us better people.

453
00:34:46,024 --> 00:34:48,331
So, Billy says
you have orderly experience.

454
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:49,985
That's right.

455
00:34:50,072 --> 00:34:51,682
You workin' right now?

456
00:34:51,769 --> 00:34:55,207
A few shifts at Teenytown.
Helping with the train.

457
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:56,513
'Cause I do three days a week

458
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,689
at Rivington House,
the hospice.

459
00:34:58,776 --> 00:35:00,778
Good orderly is tough to find.

460
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,127
Tougher to keep.

461
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,609
Do dying people bother you?

462
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:07,350
No.

463
00:35:07,437 --> 00:35:08,917
We're all dying.

464
00:35:09,004 --> 00:35:12,007
The world is one big hospice
with fresh air.

465
00:35:12,094 --> 00:35:13,356
Hmm.

466
00:35:55,746 --> 00:35:56,747
Wow.

467
00:35:57,661 --> 00:35:59,968
Well, hi there.

468
00:36:01,012 --> 00:36:02,579
You said it didn't hurt.

469
00:36:05,016 --> 00:36:07,801
Doesn't now, does it?

470
00:36:07,889 --> 00:36:09,673
Felt like I was dying.

471
00:36:11,022 --> 00:36:12,241
I know.

472
00:36:12,328 --> 00:36:13,720
You did.

473
00:36:15,026 --> 00:36:16,854
You'll feel better
when you eat.

474
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,595
Am I still human?

475
00:36:19,857 --> 00:36:22,120
Do you care?

476
00:36:49,017 --> 00:36:51,933
Hey. Let him be.

477
00:36:53,804 --> 00:36:55,849
Azreel, leave him be.

478
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:07,513
Azzie?

479
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:09,863
Azzie, come on.

480
00:37:10,777 --> 00:37:13,563
Come on. Azzie.

481
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,868
Doc.

482
00:37:15,826 --> 00:37:17,741
That you, Doc?

483
00:37:17,828 --> 00:37:19,395
No, I'm not a doctor.

484
00:37:19,482 --> 00:37:21,658
Do you want me
to get you a doctor?

485
00:37:21,745 --> 00:37:23,094
The cat's on my bed.

486
00:37:23,181 --> 00:37:24,661
Oh, hey, I'll move her.

487
00:37:24,748 --> 00:37:26,054
No.

488
00:37:26,141 --> 00:37:28,404
I knew she would be.

489
00:37:28,491 --> 00:37:32,582
That cat
always seems to know...

490
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,064
when it's time.

491
00:37:37,804 --> 00:37:40,285
-I guess it's time.
- No.

492
00:37:40,372 --> 00:37:42,940
It's just Azzie
being a silly old cat.

493
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,160
Nope.

494
00:37:45,247 --> 00:37:47,684
Been that way
ever since I got here.

495
00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:50,730
The cat knows

496
00:37:50,817 --> 00:37:53,037
when it's time to go to sleep.

497
00:37:53,124 --> 00:37:55,213
Everybody knows that.

498
00:37:56,736 --> 00:37:58,869
I'm gonna die.

499
00:38:09,314 --> 00:38:11,534
Yes.

500
00:38:11,621 --> 00:38:12,709
Let me get you someone.

501
00:38:12,796 --> 00:38:14,015
No.

502
00:38:15,799 --> 00:38:18,715
Known it was comin'.

503
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,806
Doesn't make it less scary.

504
00:38:22,893 --> 00:38:24,503
Yeah.

505
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,723
But maybe
it's just like you say,

506
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:29,682
just going to sleep.

507
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:33,469
I mean, there's nothing scary.
It's just sleeping.

508
00:38:33,556 --> 00:38:35,688
You're a strange
type of doctor.

509
00:38:35,775 --> 00:38:37,560
I told you, I'm not a doctor.

510
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:39,431
Oh, I think you are.

511
00:38:40,345 --> 00:38:42,391
Doctor Sleep.

512
00:38:42,478 --> 00:38:46,047
Doc, I am so scared
it's gonna hurt, or be dark,

513
00:38:46,134 --> 00:38:48,875
or be nothing at all.
And I don't wanna--

514
00:38:48,962 --> 00:38:50,921
Nothing to be scared of.

515
00:38:51,878 --> 00:38:54,838
Just going to sleep.

516
00:38:54,925 --> 00:38:59,495
Finally, true, restful sleep.

517
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,196
Oh, thank you.

518
00:39:06,415 --> 00:39:09,679
Thank you, Doc.

519
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:12,334
Look, I shouldn't be here.
Let me go get you some--

520
00:39:12,421 --> 00:39:13,770
No, no, no.

521
00:39:13,857 --> 00:39:17,687
You're exactly
where you should be.

522
00:39:19,906 --> 00:39:21,473
Exactly.

523
00:39:25,825 --> 00:39:28,350
I see my wife.

524
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,448
Dan, alcoholic.

525
00:41:06,535 --> 00:41:08,189
Hi, Dan.

526
00:41:08,276 --> 00:41:10,669
I'm not much of a speech guy.

527
00:41:10,756 --> 00:41:12,018
I just thought
I'd hold the chip

528
00:41:12,105 --> 00:41:14,543
and talk about
whatever popped up.

529
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:17,981
And I'm thinkin' about my dad.

530
00:41:19,287 --> 00:41:20,636
He died when I was five,

531
00:41:20,723 --> 00:41:22,725
so the only way
I got to know him,

532
00:41:22,812 --> 00:41:26,946
really got to know him,
was when I went dark.

533
00:41:27,033 --> 00:41:30,863
When I drank to dull the,

534
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,692
or, uh,

535
00:41:33,779 --> 00:41:36,129
whenever I wanted
to break someone's face,

536
00:41:36,217 --> 00:41:38,697
'cause the drinking

537
00:41:38,784 --> 00:41:41,047
and the temper and the anger,

538
00:41:41,134 --> 00:41:42,832
those things in me were his.

539
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:44,877
And they were
all I could know of him.

540
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:53,277
But now, well, now I get to
know him a little different,

541
00:41:53,364 --> 00:41:56,846
'cause he also stood
in a room like this once

542
00:41:56,933 --> 00:42:01,459
wanting to get well
for me and my mom.

543
00:42:03,244 --> 00:42:05,507
And he held the chip
in his hand,

544
00:42:05,594 --> 00:42:07,900
and the chip said five months

545
00:42:07,987 --> 00:42:10,512
and on that day, he...

546
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:12,253
Before it all...

547
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:16,474
Well, on that day,
all he wanted in the world

548
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:18,694
was to stand
where I'm standing now.

549
00:42:19,956 --> 00:42:21,871
And here I am,

550
00:42:23,481 --> 00:42:26,267
so thank you for us both,
I guess.

551
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,182
This is for Jack Torrance.

552
00:42:45,808 --> 00:42:46,852
Hey, Charlie.

553
00:42:50,552 --> 00:42:51,509
Doc?

554
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:00,213
Guess I don't need to ask
why you're here at this hour.

555
00:43:02,172 --> 00:43:04,217
Do you have pain?

556
00:43:04,305 --> 00:43:06,698
Do you want me to get
Claudette to bring you a pill?

557
00:43:08,047 --> 00:43:09,875
Pill won't matter.

558
00:43:11,703 --> 00:43:15,707
I'm not scared of hell, Doc.

559
00:43:15,794 --> 00:43:20,408
I lived a decent life.

560
00:43:20,495 --> 00:43:23,585
I don't think there is
such a place anyway.

561
00:43:23,672 --> 00:43:25,500
I guess I'm scared...

562
00:43:27,153 --> 00:43:30,374
there's nothing.

563
00:43:30,461 --> 00:43:32,463
We don't end, Charlie.

564
00:43:33,421 --> 00:43:35,510
I know that for certain.

565
00:43:35,597 --> 00:43:37,512
I don't know much else,

566
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:41,211
but I know that we don't end.

567
00:43:43,344 --> 00:43:45,041
Blueberries.

568
00:43:45,128 --> 00:43:50,916
I can taste blueberries
my mother used to grow.

569
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,701
Can you taste them?

570
00:43:52,788 --> 00:43:54,703
Yeah, I can.

571
00:43:56,661 --> 00:43:59,621
And I can hear Frank
on your old radio.

572
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:01,187
The one you used to have
on your workbench

573
00:44:01,274 --> 00:44:04,016

Been a minute, little pen pal.

582
00:44:53,588 --> 00:44:58,114
- Abra? School.

583
00:44:58,201 --> 00:45:00,377
Fine, I know.

584
00:45:18,656 --> 00:45:20,789
Hey, Gramps, you seen Rosie?

585
00:45:20,876 --> 00:45:22,747
Watchtower.

586
00:45:24,749 --> 00:45:26,708
You feelin' okay?

587
00:45:26,795 --> 00:45:28,971
Peachy keen.

588
00:45:47,206 --> 00:45:48,686
Hey.

589
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:51,689
Sorry to interrupt.

590
00:45:51,776 --> 00:45:53,865
Any luck?

591
00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:55,954
-Gettin' closer.
-Hmm.

592
00:45:56,041 --> 00:45:58,740
He's somewhere in Iowa,
I think.

593
00:45:58,827 --> 00:46:00,829
We'll all take
a nice long road trip

594
00:46:00,916 --> 00:46:02,744
once I'm sure I've found him.

595
00:46:05,616 --> 00:46:07,705
Until I do, we...

596
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:10,708
You gotta open
a canister, Rosie.

597
00:46:10,795 --> 00:46:12,405
We took steam
six months ago, Crow.

598
00:46:12,493 --> 00:46:14,451
Six months is nothing.

599
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:16,671
That kid in Delaware
wasn't so steamy

600
00:46:16,758 --> 00:46:18,411
and it's already showing.

601
00:46:18,499 --> 00:46:20,326
You see
Grampa Flick's hair, yeah?

602
00:46:20,413 --> 00:46:21,676
Yeah.

603
00:46:21,763 --> 00:46:23,416
-I don't think he's well.

604
00:46:23,504 --> 00:46:25,984
Grampa Flick hasn't been well
since Nixon was in office.

605
00:46:26,071 --> 00:46:28,291
I know.

606
00:46:28,378 --> 00:46:31,294
But we need to eat.
All of us.

607
00:46:32,687 --> 00:46:34,645
Are the canisters low?

608
00:46:34,732 --> 00:46:36,342
Course not.

609
00:46:36,429 --> 00:46:39,650
Just no need to waste one
if you're close to the kill.

610
00:46:41,304 --> 00:46:42,610
-Rosie.
-Mmm-hmm?

611
00:46:42,697 --> 00:46:45,308
I might need it
just to find him.

612
00:46:49,138 --> 00:46:50,661
There used to be more steam
in the world, you know?

613
00:46:50,748 --> 00:46:52,489
Oh, don't be daft. Come on.

614
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,186
That's like when rubes say,

615
00:46:54,273 --> 00:46:56,406
"50 years ago, people used to
be more neighborly."

616
00:46:56,493 --> 00:46:58,147
But it's true, Rosie.

617
00:46:58,234 --> 00:47:00,149
There's less steam out there,
and it's weaker, too.

618
00:47:00,236 --> 00:47:02,151
I don't know if it's their
cell phones or diets,

619
00:47:02,238 --> 00:47:03,761
or their Netflix or what,

620
00:47:03,848 --> 00:47:05,937
but I am not picking up
many scents these days

621
00:47:06,024 --> 00:47:07,591
and the ones that I do, Rosie,
are just not that--

622
00:47:07,678 --> 00:47:09,724
I'll open a canister tonight
to tide everyone over.

623
00:47:09,811 --> 00:47:11,464
Thank you.

624
00:47:17,514 --> 00:47:19,777
-You know it, Rosie.
-I know what?

625
00:47:19,864 --> 00:47:21,126
It's why
you're up here every day.

626
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,432
It's why you're always up here

627
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:23,912
no matter
what you tell the others.

628
00:47:24,956 --> 00:47:26,392
The world's not as steamy

629
00:47:26,479 --> 00:47:28,569
and you are looking
for a whale.

630
00:48:17,139 --> 00:48:18,183
Oh, watch this kid.

631
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,707
Number 19.

632
00:48:19,794 --> 00:48:21,622
That kid is a natural.

633
00:48:21,709 --> 00:48:23,624
He hits the ball every time.

634
00:48:23,711 --> 00:48:26,017
Like he can read
the pitcher's mind.

635
00:48:26,104 --> 00:48:27,715
Hmm. Is that right?

636
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:37,289
See? You watch,

637
00:48:37,376 --> 00:48:38,900
one of these days,
one of those talent scouts

638
00:48:38,987 --> 00:48:41,772
is gonna get wind of
Brad there. You watch.

639
00:49:03,489 --> 00:49:06,057
Hey, 19,

640
00:49:06,144 --> 00:49:08,407
just saw your game.

641
00:49:08,494 --> 00:49:10,540
You are ready for the majors.

642
00:49:10,627 --> 00:49:12,411
-Well played.
-Thanks.

643
00:49:12,498 --> 00:49:14,196
Hey, you headin' home?

644
00:49:14,283 --> 00:49:17,416
You wanna hop in?
I'll give you a ride.

645
00:49:17,503 --> 00:49:19,592
No, it's real close.

646
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,768
I'm good.

647
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,989
It's okay.

648
00:49:25,076 --> 00:49:26,469
We're friends.

649
00:49:26,556 --> 00:49:28,166
You wanna hop in.
We'll take you right home.

650
00:49:29,385 --> 00:49:31,126
You can take me right home.

651
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,303
You trust me.

652
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:35,870
I trust you.

653
00:50:10,731 --> 00:50:13,298
No! No, please! No!

654
00:50:24,745 --> 00:50:26,747
No! Please let me go.

655
00:50:26,834 --> 00:50:29,532
Please, I won't tell.
Please. Please!

656
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,886
Number 19.

657
00:50:35,973 --> 00:50:37,496
Kid, you were good.

658
00:50:37,583 --> 00:50:39,672
No!

659
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:46,723
No, please let me go.

660
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,072
-I won't tell.

661
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:49,813
I won't tell. Please.

662
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,119
It's okay.

663
00:50:51,206 --> 00:50:52,337
Please.

664
00:50:55,688 --> 00:50:56,689
Ah.

665
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:03,087
Are you gonna hurt me?

666
00:51:03,174 --> 00:51:04,262
Yes.

667
00:51:04,349 --> 00:51:06,177
No!

668
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:09,877
Pain purifies steam.

669
00:51:09,964 --> 00:51:12,705
Fear, too, so, you understand.

670
00:51:32,595 --> 00:51:34,858
Shh.

671
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:06,281
Stop.

672
00:52:07,282 --> 00:52:08,805
Stop.

673
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:10,285
Stop!

674
00:52:12,026 --> 00:52:13,766
Stop, monster.

675
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:22,253
Stop. Stop.

676
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:24,516
What is it?

677
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:37,312
No! Stop!

678
00:52:41,882 --> 00:52:43,274
Abra! Abra!

679
00:52:43,361 --> 00:52:44,972
Hey, hey, hey!

680
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:46,538
Sweetie. Sweetheart, wake up.
Wake up, sweetheart.

681
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:47,713
-Abra, wake up!
-Hey, hey, hey.

682
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,193
-Abra! Abra!
-Stop it!

683
00:52:58,289 --> 00:52:59,247
Jesus.

684
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:46,337
Okay.

685
00:53:46,947 --> 00:53:48,644
Okay.

686
00:53:49,384 --> 00:53:50,951
Okay.

687
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:55,102
Okay, ready?

688
00:55:08,419 --> 00:55:10,813
They killed him.

689
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:13,207
They killed him.

690
00:55:18,255 --> 00:55:20,040
- It's okay.
- It's all right.

691
00:55:31,399 --> 00:55:32,965
We had a looker.

692
00:55:37,622 --> 00:55:39,102
Tonight?

693
00:55:39,189 --> 00:55:40,451
Mmm-hmm.

694
00:55:40,538 --> 00:55:42,279
Yeah.

695
00:55:42,366 --> 00:55:44,586
Big steam?

696
00:55:44,673 --> 00:55:46,892
Oh, honey, it was huge.

697
00:55:48,198 --> 00:55:49,504
Where?

698
00:55:49,591 --> 00:55:51,854
East Coast, I think.

699
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:56,424
You're saying
someone looked in

700
00:55:56,511 --> 00:55:58,861
from 1,500 miles away?

701
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:01,907
Maybe further.

702
00:56:03,779 --> 00:56:05,128
Boy or girl?

703
00:56:05,215 --> 00:56:06,999
Girl, I think.

704
00:56:07,087 --> 00:56:10,046
She was out of there so fast.

705
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:13,093
But I swear, Crow Daddy,

706
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:16,052
I haven't felt power
like that,

707
00:56:16,922 --> 00:56:19,403
raw power like that...

708
00:56:20,274 --> 00:56:22,928
in so long.

709
00:56:23,015 --> 00:56:25,105
Then we need to look into it.

710
00:56:25,192 --> 00:56:27,150
-Sooner the better.
-Yeah.

711
00:56:27,237 --> 00:56:28,978
Case her parents freak out,

712
00:56:29,065 --> 00:56:31,546
send her to a psychiatrist.

713
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:34,679
You know, they get her on
pills, could ruin the steam.

714
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:35,854
Might muffle her just--

715
00:56:35,941 --> 00:56:37,421
No, giving Paxil to this kid,

716
00:56:37,508 --> 00:56:39,728
it's like throwing
a piece of Saran Wrap

717
00:56:39,815 --> 00:56:41,295
over a searchlight.

718
00:56:41,382 --> 00:56:43,775
I don't know where she is

719
00:56:43,862 --> 00:56:47,605
but when she comes back,
and she'll be back,

720
00:56:47,692 --> 00:56:49,738
oh, I'll be ready, honey.

721
00:56:52,044 --> 00:56:53,655
I'll be ready.

722
00:57:54,585 --> 00:57:56,283
Morning.

723
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:57,414
Morning.

724
00:57:59,068 --> 00:58:00,200
Guess what.

725
00:58:00,287 --> 00:58:02,202
I made a new friend.

726
00:58:02,289 --> 00:58:03,986
His name's Dan.

727
00:58:04,073 --> 00:58:06,162
Abs, are you okay?

728
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:07,468
Last night, I...

729
00:58:07,555 --> 00:58:09,557
I'm okay.

730
00:58:09,644 --> 00:58:11,211
Sorry about that.

731
00:58:11,298 --> 00:58:14,344
I know that head of yours
is like a radio sometimes.

732
00:58:14,431 --> 00:58:18,435
And you pick up
some weird stations.

733
00:58:18,522 --> 00:58:19,567
Nothing weird like that.

734
00:58:20,568 --> 00:58:22,526
Not anymore.

735
00:58:31,318 --> 00:58:32,841
My God.

736
00:58:32,928 --> 00:58:35,626
I've gotta study.
If I don't study...

737
00:58:35,713 --> 00:58:39,674
Running play.
Hand-off to 11 and...

738
00:58:39,761 --> 00:58:42,590
Coach is gonna kill me
if I don't get these.

739
00:58:42,677 --> 00:58:44,548
Why doesn't he like me?

740
00:58:44,635 --> 00:58:46,550
My hair?
I should change my hair.

741
00:58:46,637 --> 00:58:48,204
The freak
is staring at me again.

742
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:49,988
What is she staring at?

743
00:58:50,075 --> 00:58:51,120
Freak.

744
00:59:30,899 --> 00:59:31,943
Hey, Abba-doo.

745
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,249
Hey, Dad.

746
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:35,556
School okay?

747
00:59:35,643 --> 00:59:37,253
How's the book?

748
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,255
Good. Yeah, going good.

749
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:41,301
I'm writing about
Charleston and Black Bottom.

750
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,825
It's feeling like...

751
00:59:43,912 --> 00:59:45,827
I'm going to
start my homework.

752
00:59:45,914 --> 00:59:49,483
Okay. Good.
That's good, sweetie.

753
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:51,702
Think Harvard in three years.

754
00:59:51,789 --> 00:59:52,964
We'll see.

755
00:59:53,051 --> 00:59:54,836
Yeah. We will see.

756
01:02:56,104 --> 01:02:57,975
Thanks so much
for shopping with us today.

757
01:02:58,062 --> 01:03:01,152
And remember, we're
always fresh, just for you.

758
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:32,009
Well, hi there.

759
01:03:40,017 --> 01:03:41,279
Get out!

760
01:03:43,368 --> 01:03:45,196
Get out! Get out of my head!

761
01:03:47,024 --> 01:03:48,243
Get out!

762
01:03:57,774 --> 01:04:00,168
-Ma'am, are you okay?
-No! No.

763
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:02,257
Yeah, I'm fine.

764
01:04:03,301 --> 01:04:04,738
I'm fine.

765
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:14,138
Jesus.

766
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:16,010
Danno?

767
01:04:16,097 --> 01:04:17,577
-Dan? Dan?

768
01:04:17,664 --> 01:04:19,840
Get up. Stand up, Dan.

769
01:04:19,927 --> 01:04:21,189
Come on, Danno.

770
01:04:22,843 --> 01:04:25,106
-What happened?
-Well, you just dropped.

771
01:04:25,193 --> 01:04:27,848
Thought you was having
a stroke. Who's Tony?

772
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,677
What?

773
01:04:30,764 --> 01:04:32,069
You kept saying,
"Please help me, Tony."

774
01:04:33,418 --> 01:04:35,377
Oh.

775
01:04:35,464 --> 01:04:37,945
Well, I'm sorry about that.

776
01:04:57,617 --> 01:04:59,575
Rosie?

777
01:05:10,804 --> 01:05:12,196
We've got a problem.

778
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:13,415
-Talk to me.
-The looker?

779
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:16,636
Yeah, she found me again.

780
01:05:16,723 --> 01:05:18,333
-How?
-I don't know.

781
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:19,813
I don't care.

782
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:23,077
We have to have her, Crow.
We have to.

783
01:05:23,164 --> 01:05:25,470
Does she know who you are?
Where we are?

784
01:05:25,557 --> 01:05:27,211
No, I don't know.
I don't think...

785
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:28,691
That's not the important--
Look.

786
01:05:29,605 --> 01:05:31,085
I said she's huge steam,

787
01:05:31,172 --> 01:05:32,390
-right?
-Mmm-hmm.

788
01:05:32,477 --> 01:05:34,131
Yeah, it's even bigger
than that.

789
01:05:34,218 --> 01:05:35,742
I tried to turn around in her

790
01:05:35,829 --> 01:05:38,527
and she blew me out of her
like I was nothing.

791
01:05:38,614 --> 01:05:39,789
Bullshit.

792
01:05:39,876 --> 01:05:42,009
No. Never happened
to me, ever.

793
01:05:42,096 --> 01:05:43,793
I would have said
that was impossible.

794
01:05:45,577 --> 01:05:47,841
Is she food,
or do we turn her?

795
01:05:48,668 --> 01:05:50,278
We don't turn her.

796
01:05:50,365 --> 01:05:51,758
Rosie, are you sure?

797
01:05:51,845 --> 01:05:53,411
If she's what you say
she is, then--

798
01:05:53,498 --> 01:05:56,458
Then we don't want anyone
with that power in the Knot.

799
01:05:56,545 --> 01:05:58,547
Jeez. Think about it.

800
01:06:03,683 --> 01:06:04,988
Have a great day.

801
01:06:05,075 --> 01:06:06,686
You, too.

802
01:07:24,851 --> 01:07:26,504
Hi.

803
01:07:36,732 --> 01:07:38,429
Billy.

804
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:58,014
You can hear me.

805
01:07:58,101 --> 01:08:00,756
Let's use our outside voices,
all right?

806
01:08:01,801 --> 01:08:03,454
You tracked me down?

807
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:07,241
It was easier than I thought.
Like GPS, but in my head.

808
01:08:07,328 --> 01:08:08,677
Look, I don't mean
any offense,

809
01:08:08,764 --> 01:08:12,246
but this day and age,
a grown man

810
01:08:12,333 --> 01:08:14,117
sitting with a teenage girl
on a park bench...

811
01:08:14,204 --> 01:08:15,510
I'm Abra Stone.

812
01:08:15,597 --> 01:08:17,120
And if anyone asks,
you're my uncle.

813
01:08:17,207 --> 01:08:19,079
Uncle Dan.

814
01:08:21,255 --> 01:08:24,519
And that's not even a lie.
Not totally.

815
01:08:24,606 --> 01:08:26,608
You're magic, like me.

816
01:08:28,175 --> 01:08:30,351
I don't know about magic.

817
01:08:31,091 --> 01:08:32,396
I...

818
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,181
I always called it
the shining.

819
01:08:34,268 --> 01:08:36,923
And, yeah, we both shine.

820
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:38,489
Do your parents know?

821
01:08:38,576 --> 01:08:41,231
About my shine?

822
01:08:41,318 --> 01:08:43,494
They don't talk about it.

823
01:08:43,581 --> 01:08:46,933
Or if I use it,
they look at me different.

824
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:49,413
When I was a kid, I didn't
understand the shining.

825
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,285
I called it "Tony."

826
01:08:51,372 --> 01:08:53,722
I thought he was
my imaginary friend.

827
01:08:53,809 --> 01:08:56,768
I thought you were
my imaginary friend...

828
01:08:56,856 --> 01:08:58,945
for a long time.

829
01:09:00,207 --> 01:09:03,601
How many of us are out there?

830
01:09:03,688 --> 01:09:05,603
There's a lot of people who
have a little bit of shine,

831
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:07,257
they don't even know it.

832
01:09:07,344 --> 01:09:08,737
They always seem
to come home with flowers

833
01:09:08,824 --> 01:09:10,608
when their wives are sad,

834
01:09:10,695 --> 01:09:12,697
or they do well on the school
test they didn't study for.

835
01:09:12,784 --> 01:09:15,526
But I only met two or three
people in my whole life

836
01:09:15,613 --> 01:09:17,050
who knew they shined.

837
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,619
The baseball boy shined.

838
01:09:21,706 --> 01:09:24,013
His name was Bradley Trevor.

839
01:09:26,581 --> 01:09:28,931
These people...

840
01:09:29,018 --> 01:09:31,629
they look like people anyway,
they took him.

841
01:09:32,804 --> 01:09:34,894
And they ate him.

842
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:38,549
They ate his shine.

843
01:09:38,636 --> 01:09:40,943
You could feel it?

844
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:42,510
And they could feel me.

845
01:09:44,381 --> 01:09:45,817
If you could get
something of his,

846
01:09:45,905 --> 01:09:47,254
if you could go to Iowa...

847
01:09:47,341 --> 01:09:49,082
-Whoa, hang on.
-I can help you find him.

848
01:09:49,169 --> 01:09:50,648
Then his parents would know
where he was.

849
01:09:50,735 --> 01:09:52,607
They could bury him right,
at least.

850
01:09:52,694 --> 01:09:54,696
We could also get his glove.

851
01:09:54,783 --> 01:09:56,611
If I can touch that glove,
I can track them.

852
01:09:56,698 --> 01:09:58,265
Easy. Easy.

853
01:09:58,352 --> 01:10:00,963
Because Barry the Chunk,
I think that was his name,

854
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:03,009
for a while,
before they killed him,

855
01:10:03,096 --> 01:10:05,011
he was wearing it.

856
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:19,373
Abra, go home.

857
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,331
Don't chase these people.

858
01:10:21,418 --> 01:10:23,420
Don't aggravate them.

859
01:10:23,507 --> 01:10:26,554
And whatever you do,
don't attract their attention.

860
01:10:26,641 --> 01:10:28,251
Find something, anything,

861
01:10:28,338 --> 01:10:32,429
well, almost anything,
to stop that shine of yours.

862
01:10:32,516 --> 01:10:34,257
Keep your head down
and hope to God

863
01:10:34,344 --> 01:10:36,825
that these people
or anything like them,

864
01:10:36,912 --> 01:10:39,610
that they don't see you.

865
01:10:39,697 --> 01:10:42,178
If they see you,
they come back.

866
01:10:42,265 --> 01:10:44,354
Abra, do you hear me?

867
01:10:45,225 --> 01:10:47,488
They come back.

868
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:51,883
Keep your head down.
Stay safe.

869
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,148
I'm sorry.

870
01:11:05,506 --> 01:11:07,290
Hey, Azzie.

871
01:11:19,999 --> 01:11:22,436
You got your wires
crossed tonight.

872
01:11:25,004 --> 01:11:26,788
That room's empty, Az.

873
01:11:31,227 --> 01:11:33,447
There's no one in that room.

874
01:11:41,759 --> 01:11:44,675
Whoa! Hang on, Doc.

875
01:11:44,762 --> 01:11:45,763
Dick.

876
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,940
Oh, I'm so sorry.

877
01:11:49,028 --> 01:11:50,464
I... I... I thought it was...

878
01:11:50,551 --> 01:11:52,292
Thought I was
from the Overlook.

879
01:11:52,379 --> 01:11:54,729
Almost locked me up.

880
01:11:54,816 --> 01:11:57,253
Still getting visits
from them old ghosts?

881
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:59,125
No, not for years.

882
01:11:59,212 --> 01:12:00,909
Horace Derwent
was the last one,

883
01:12:00,996 --> 01:12:02,606
confetti on his suit.

884
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:04,565
Said, "Great party, isn't it?"

885
01:12:04,652 --> 01:12:06,132
Shit-eating grin on his face

886
01:12:06,219 --> 01:12:08,047
till I pulled out
a box for him.

887
01:12:08,134 --> 01:12:11,137
-That grin went fast.

888
01:12:11,224 --> 01:12:13,487
Hey, it never occurred to me
to ask you back then,

889
01:12:13,574 --> 01:12:15,271
what happens to them
in those boxes?

890
01:12:15,358 --> 01:12:16,707
Do they die in there?

891
01:12:16,794 --> 01:12:18,405
Do you care?

892
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:21,756
I missed you.

893
01:12:21,843 --> 01:12:23,236
Has it been a long time?

894
01:12:24,628 --> 01:12:27,022
Can't tell.

895
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:30,808
This world is a dream
of a dream to me now.

896
01:12:30,895 --> 01:12:33,942
Eight years. Little more.

897
01:12:34,029 --> 01:12:36,205
Why are you here?

898
01:12:36,292 --> 01:12:39,817
I'm here because
it all comes 'round.

899
01:12:39,904 --> 01:12:42,820
Ka's a wheel, Doc.

900
01:12:42,907 --> 01:12:46,215
These empty devils
ever found you

901
01:12:46,302 --> 01:12:47,956
when you was a tyke,

902
01:12:48,043 --> 01:12:50,263
if they'd even sniffed you,

903
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:52,613
you'd be long dead.

904
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:54,876
They eat screams,

905
01:12:54,963 --> 01:12:57,400
and drink pain,

906
01:12:57,487 --> 01:13:00,403
and they've noticed
that little girl.

907
01:13:01,535 --> 01:13:03,624
They might kill her,

908
01:13:04,538 --> 01:13:07,671
might turn her...

909
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:10,587
or might keep her
till she's all used up,

910
01:13:10,674 --> 01:13:12,023
and that'd be worst of all.

911
01:13:12,111 --> 01:13:14,678
You can't let 'em.

912
01:13:16,245 --> 01:13:18,334
Why me?

913
01:13:18,421 --> 01:13:20,815
Because she found you.

914
01:13:20,902 --> 01:13:24,340
Because she showed up.
Hell, Doc, why me?

915
01:13:24,427 --> 01:13:26,647
You just walked on
into my kitchen one day,

916
01:13:26,734 --> 01:13:28,170
and I'm still on the hook.

917
01:13:28,257 --> 01:13:30,912
What the hell am I
supposed to do?

918
01:13:32,305 --> 01:13:35,525
Get her what she asked for.

919
01:13:36,918 --> 01:13:40,051
You won't see me again, Doc.

920
01:13:40,139 --> 01:13:42,489
This is my last dream.

921
01:13:48,277 --> 01:13:51,933
It seems to me
you grew up fine, son,

922
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:54,805
but you still owe a debt.

923
01:13:58,896 --> 01:14:00,898
Pay it.

924
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:18,612
-Hey.
-Hey, Mom.

925
01:14:18,699 --> 01:14:19,917
You feeling okay?

926
01:14:20,004 --> 01:14:22,006
We missed you at dinner.

927
01:14:22,093 --> 01:14:25,314
I'm okay.
Just had a rough day.

928
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:32,365
I'm flying out to see Momo
in the morning.

929
01:14:32,452 --> 01:14:34,454
I'll be back as soon as I can.

930
01:14:36,107 --> 01:14:38,109
Abs, is she...

931
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:43,898
Is she gonna pull through
this time?

932
01:14:47,771 --> 01:14:48,859
I don't know.

933
01:14:50,339 --> 01:14:51,819
I hope so.

934
01:14:52,689 --> 01:14:54,300
Tell her I love her.

935
01:17:37,288 --> 01:17:39,552
Keep sleeping, princess.

936
01:17:53,174 --> 01:17:56,438
You rubes.

937
01:17:56,525 --> 01:17:59,876
Spend your whole lives
making little boxes,

938
01:17:59,963 --> 01:18:02,923
little memories.

939
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:05,882
Oh, you think
they make you so rich.

940
01:18:05,969 --> 01:18:08,232
You should see mine, kiddo.

941
01:18:09,582 --> 01:18:13,063
Oh, my mind's a cathedral.

942
01:18:16,197 --> 01:18:18,939
Well, hi there.

943
01:18:26,686 --> 01:18:27,861
Hmm.

944
01:18:42,963 --> 01:18:43,920
He said you'd come back.

945
01:18:46,227 --> 01:18:47,228
And you did.

946
01:18:49,273 --> 01:18:50,536
Good.

947
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,754
No!

948
01:18:52,973 --> 01:18:56,324
Get back! Get back!

949
01:18:56,411 --> 01:18:59,153
You're just a fucking child!

950
01:19:04,375 --> 01:19:05,812
Where are you?

951
01:19:05,899 --> 01:19:08,205
Where? Where did you...
Where...

952
01:19:08,292 --> 01:19:10,207
What did you...
Where did you...

953
01:19:11,861 --> 01:19:12,819
No.

954
01:19:15,038 --> 01:19:16,779
Get out! Get out!

955
01:19:16,866 --> 01:19:17,998
Get out!

956
01:20:03,739 --> 01:20:04,740
Rose?

957
01:20:04,827 --> 01:20:06,133
Trap.

958
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:07,569
Trap.

959
01:20:07,656 --> 01:20:09,092
-What the hell happened?

960
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:10,572
Little bitch
set a trap for me.

961
01:20:10,659 --> 01:20:12,313
Oh, my God. Oh, your hand.

962
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,967
Rose! Rose, calm down.

963
01:20:14,054 --> 01:20:16,230
We know where she is now,
right? Now we know.

964
01:20:16,317 --> 01:20:17,666
She was in my head!

965
01:20:17,753 --> 01:20:19,320
-What?
-Stealing!

966
01:20:19,407 --> 01:20:21,757
-What does she know?
-I don't know. I don't know.

967
01:20:21,844 --> 01:20:24,543
-How much does she--
-I don't know!

968
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:26,588
- I don't know...
-There's a problem.

969
01:20:26,675 --> 01:20:27,676
Not now!

970
01:20:27,763 --> 01:20:28,851
Grampa Flick...

971
01:20:29,896 --> 01:20:31,811
I think he's cycling.

972
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,862
Uncle Dan!
Uncle Dan, I hurt her.

973
01:20:39,949 --> 01:20:41,124
I really hurt her.

974
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:42,822
I hurt her
and she deserved it,

975
01:20:42,909 --> 01:20:44,301
and that's not the best part.
The best part is...

976
01:20:44,388 --> 01:20:46,042
The best part is
I got in her head.

977
01:20:46,129 --> 01:20:47,827
I got in her head.

978
01:20:47,914 --> 01:20:50,133
-Uncle Dan? Are you there?
-Oh, God, Abra.

979
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:51,308
Can you hear me?

980
01:20:51,395 --> 01:20:52,614
What have you done?

981
01:21:08,891 --> 01:21:11,372
Just talk to the kid.

982
01:21:11,459 --> 01:21:14,331
If we're gonna do this,
then let's do this.

983
01:21:16,943 --> 01:21:17,944
Hi, Abra.

984
01:21:22,296 --> 01:21:23,993
I can hear you.

985
01:21:28,041 --> 01:21:29,956
I don't understand.

986
01:21:30,043 --> 01:21:31,174
You will.

987
01:21:33,002 --> 01:21:35,918
I thought we lived forever.

988
01:21:36,005 --> 01:21:38,529
Did someone
promise you that, Andi?

989
01:21:38,617 --> 01:21:42,185
Did someone say
you're immortal?

990
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:47,103
I said, "Live long, eat well."

991
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:49,192
We can live long, very long.

992
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:50,367
And we do,

993
01:21:50,454 --> 01:21:51,978
most of us.

994
01:21:52,065 --> 01:21:54,284
But we haven't
been eating well.

995
01:21:55,416 --> 01:21:58,288
Not for a long time.

996
01:21:58,375 --> 01:21:59,638
Rosie, he's going.

997
01:22:01,465 --> 01:22:02,641
Rosie.

998
01:22:08,516 --> 01:22:10,126
Yes, love?

999
01:22:11,214 --> 01:22:12,955
I'm scared.

1000
01:22:13,042 --> 01:22:15,610
No, you're not.

1001
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:19,048
You watched empires rise

1002
01:22:19,135 --> 01:22:21,094
and fall.

1003
01:22:21,181 --> 01:22:23,662
Cheered the gladiators
in Rome.

1004
01:22:23,749 --> 01:22:26,055
Sailed across oceans

1005
01:22:26,142 --> 01:22:28,188
to new worlds

1006
01:22:28,275 --> 01:22:29,406
while you fed on

1007
01:22:29,493 --> 01:22:34,194
kings, and princes, and popes.

1008
01:22:34,281 --> 01:22:36,936
They wrote myths of you,

1009
01:22:37,023 --> 01:22:39,373
and made statues,

1010
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:44,073
and they trembled
in their villages, and beds...

1011
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:46,989
and skyscrapers.

1012
01:22:48,077 --> 01:22:50,601
-So, no...

1013
01:22:50,689 --> 01:22:53,517
...you're not scared.

1014
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:56,782
You're a king,

1015
01:22:57,826 --> 01:23:01,482
and you eat fear.

1016
01:23:51,924 --> 01:23:53,142
Hey, bro.

1017
01:23:53,229 --> 01:23:54,578
You know, it's 4:00 a.m.

1018
01:23:54,665 --> 01:23:56,537
You've always seen me, Billy.

1019
01:23:56,624 --> 01:24:00,193
You have a good sense about
people, is that fair to say?

1020
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:01,672
Yeah, what--

1021
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:03,500
You think I'm an honest man?
A good man?

1022
01:24:03,587 --> 01:24:05,024
I do, I do. Dan, I...

1023
01:24:05,111 --> 01:24:06,721
I need your help.

1024
01:24:06,808 --> 01:24:08,375
The first thing I need is
for you to listen to a story

1025
01:24:08,462 --> 01:24:11,770
and try harder than you've
ever tried to believe me.

1026
01:24:28,090 --> 01:24:30,527
How's it going?

1027
01:24:30,614 --> 01:24:33,269
Oh, hey. Shouldn't you
be getting ready for school?

1028
01:24:33,356 --> 01:24:35,924
Yeah, but I wanted
to tag along.

1029
01:24:36,011 --> 01:24:37,578
How long
have you been driving?

1030
01:24:37,665 --> 01:24:41,147
A few hours or so. We should
get there tonight. Late.

1031
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:45,020
Who's that?

1032
01:24:45,107 --> 01:24:47,414
He's my friend.

1033
01:24:47,501 --> 01:24:50,417
Maybe my best friend.

1034
01:24:50,504 --> 01:24:52,419
You should've seen her face.

1035
01:24:52,506 --> 01:24:54,508
She was scared, Uncle Dan.

1036
01:24:54,595 --> 01:24:56,379
Scared like
all those kids were scared.

1037
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:58,164
All those kids she's killed.

1038
01:24:58,251 --> 01:25:01,080
She was so mad
and so scared that I got in.

1039
01:25:01,167 --> 01:25:02,821
That was a new trick.

1040
01:25:02,908 --> 01:25:04,561
I've never done that before.

1041
01:25:04,648 --> 01:25:06,433
Yeah, me neither.
What was it like?

1042
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:08,739
Like a library.

1043
01:25:08,827 --> 01:25:11,046
I guess we're
all libraries inside.

1044
01:25:12,004 --> 01:25:13,570
How'd you do it?

1045
01:25:13,657 --> 01:25:15,529
Like this. Just a little push.

1046
01:25:21,056 --> 01:25:22,318
Abra!

1047
01:25:22,405 --> 01:25:24,407
-Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry!

1048
01:25:29,325 --> 01:25:30,892
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

1049
01:25:30,979 --> 01:25:32,502
It's okay.

1050
01:25:32,589 --> 01:25:33,721
What were all those boxes?

1051
01:25:34,461 --> 01:25:35,549
Nothing.

1052
01:25:35,636 --> 01:25:36,898
Liar.

1053
01:25:39,945 --> 01:25:42,338
When I was a kid,

1054
01:25:42,425 --> 01:25:43,862
younger than you,

1055
01:25:43,949 --> 01:25:45,341
I bumped into
something like these things

1056
01:25:45,428 --> 01:25:48,214
that ate like they do.

1057
01:25:48,301 --> 01:25:52,087
Only it wasn't a person,
it was a place.

1058
01:25:52,174 --> 01:25:56,700
They closed it down after
and let it rot.

1059
01:25:56,787 --> 01:25:59,660
But the things
that lived there, they...

1060
01:26:01,227 --> 01:26:03,229
Don't go poking around
in there again.

1061
01:26:03,316 --> 01:26:06,841
Okay, I won't. I promise.

1062
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:13,152
Phew!

1063
01:26:19,332 --> 01:26:21,421
We're almost ready.
We're just loading up.

1064
01:26:21,508 --> 01:26:22,901
Good.

1065
01:26:22,988 --> 01:26:24,293
Get the caravan on the road

1066
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:25,816
and we'll have her
in a day or two.

1067
01:26:25,904 --> 01:26:28,602
I don't think
you should come, Rosie.

1068
01:26:28,689 --> 01:26:31,344
The fuck did you just say?

1069
01:26:31,431 --> 01:26:33,824
She tagged you.
She got in your head.

1070
01:26:33,912 --> 01:26:35,522
Yeah, it won't happen again.

1071
01:26:35,609 --> 01:26:36,610
And who knows
how much she got to

1072
01:26:36,697 --> 01:26:37,785
before you kicked her out.

1073
01:26:37,872 --> 01:26:39,178
She's mine, Crow.

1074
01:26:39,265 --> 01:26:40,614
Right now, as far as we know,

1075
01:26:40,701 --> 01:26:43,138
you are the only one of us
she could track.

1076
01:26:43,225 --> 01:26:44,835
Now, if she sees you coming,

1077
01:26:44,923 --> 01:26:46,576
she could run

1078
01:26:46,663 --> 01:26:48,970
or set another trap.

1079
01:26:52,191 --> 01:26:55,672
You know I'm right about this.

1080
01:26:55,759 --> 01:26:57,761
If she pulls a trick on you...

1081
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:01,548
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1082
01:27:01,635 --> 01:27:04,594
But I got some tricks
of my own.

1083
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,864
Hey, I think
we're here.

1084
01:27:16,389 --> 01:27:18,782
Okay.

1085
01:27:18,869 --> 01:27:20,959
I'll see if I can get her.

1086
01:27:21,785 --> 01:27:22,786
Abra?

1087
01:27:24,745 --> 01:27:27,356
That's the sign.
Pull around back.

1088
01:27:27,443 --> 01:27:29,010
She says to pull around back.

1089
01:27:29,097 --> 01:27:30,142
And I'll tell you
when to stop.

1090
01:27:30,229 --> 01:27:32,318
She'll tell us when to stop.

1091
01:27:38,324 --> 01:27:39,673
I gotta tell you,
Danno,

1092
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,196
I don't know whether

1093
01:27:41,283 --> 01:27:42,850
I hope you're right
or wrong about this.

1094
01:27:42,937 --> 01:27:46,680
I mean, if you're wrong,
my friend is crazy.

1095
01:27:46,767 --> 01:27:48,290
I mean, full-blown...

1096
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:50,684
mental breakdown,

1097
01:27:50,771 --> 01:27:54,253
imaginary-monsters-
killing-imaginary-kids

1098
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:55,819
bonkers.

1099
01:27:55,906 --> 01:27:59,432
But, you know,
I... I can work with that.

1100
01:27:59,519 --> 01:28:01,042
If you're right, though...

1101
01:28:01,129 --> 01:28:02,391
I know.

1102
01:28:02,478 --> 01:28:04,480
It's much worse.

1103
01:28:18,538 --> 01:28:19,843
You should go home.

1104
01:28:19,930 --> 01:28:21,541
What?

1105
01:28:21,628 --> 01:28:23,978
No, not you.

1106
01:28:24,065 --> 01:28:25,414
I can handle it.

1107
01:28:25,501 --> 01:28:28,156
No. We'll take it from here.

1108
01:28:30,767 --> 01:28:33,074
Okay, it's just us.

1109
01:28:49,786 --> 01:28:52,050
You smell that?

1110
01:28:54,139 --> 01:28:56,445
Used to hunt.
I ever tell you that?

1111
01:28:56,532 --> 01:28:57,838
No.

1112
01:28:57,925 --> 01:28:59,448
Deer.

1113
01:28:59,535 --> 01:29:01,798
This one summer,

1114
01:29:01,885 --> 01:29:03,757
I clipped this buck.

1115
01:29:03,844 --> 01:29:06,281
I was tracking it
for two days.

1116
01:29:06,368 --> 01:29:09,502
I got the shot, clipped him.

1117
01:29:09,589 --> 01:29:11,852
He ran off, I went after.

1118
01:29:11,939 --> 01:29:15,508
Figured he wasn't
gonna last long.

1119
01:29:16,987 --> 01:29:17,988
Then he vanished.

1120
01:29:18,946 --> 01:29:21,862
Just up and evaporated.

1121
01:29:21,949 --> 01:29:24,734
Not a trace.
Truly baffling.

1122
01:29:27,259 --> 01:29:28,738
Five days later,

1123
01:29:28,825 --> 01:29:31,654
I'm trying a different spot,
miles away.

1124
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:35,571
I come around looking
for a spot for a blind,

1125
01:29:36,877 --> 01:29:38,879
then I smelled him.

1126
01:29:39,793 --> 01:29:41,490
Smelled him.

1127
01:29:42,317 --> 01:29:44,014
Found that buck

1128
01:29:44,102 --> 01:29:47,148
holed up to a hollow trunk.

1129
01:29:47,235 --> 01:29:49,019
Dead for days.

1130
01:29:50,282 --> 01:29:51,848
The smell...

1131
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:55,330
Never hunted a day since.

1132
01:29:58,551 --> 01:30:00,944
This is the same smell.

1133
01:30:16,308 --> 01:30:17,613
Billy.

1134
01:30:37,285 --> 01:30:39,113
Oh, my God!

1135
01:31:11,363 --> 01:31:12,581
Fuck.

1136
01:31:12,668 --> 01:31:15,236
Fuck, Danno. What the fuck?

1137
01:31:15,323 --> 01:31:16,672
They didn't
even bury him deep.

1138
01:31:16,759 --> 01:31:17,760
They buried him shallow.

1139
01:31:17,847 --> 01:31:18,979
I'm sorry, Billy.

1140
01:31:20,328 --> 01:31:22,591
What did you
get us into?

1141
01:31:30,730 --> 01:31:32,210
The people who did that...

1142
01:31:32,297 --> 01:31:34,603
They're not people.

1143
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:37,432
No. No, they ain't.

1144
01:31:37,519 --> 01:31:40,522
Anyone do that
to a little boy,

1145
01:31:40,609 --> 01:31:42,742
they ain't people.

1146
01:31:42,829 --> 01:31:44,134
Did you get it?

1147
01:31:44,222 --> 01:31:45,310
Yeah, we got it.

1148
01:31:45,397 --> 01:31:47,050
Is she back?

1149
01:31:47,137 --> 01:31:48,965
We're heading back to you.
We'll be back in the morning.

1150
01:31:49,052 --> 01:31:50,271
We got a stop to make.

1151
01:31:52,621 --> 01:31:55,537
I need you to show your
parents what's happening.

1152
01:31:55,624 --> 01:31:56,625
No.

1153
01:31:56,712 --> 01:31:57,931
-Yeah.
- No.

1154
01:31:58,018 --> 01:31:59,672
They almost think I'm normal.

1155
01:31:59,759 --> 01:32:01,239
If I tell them, they'll...

1156
01:32:01,326 --> 01:32:02,979
Rose'll go through them
to get to you.

1157
01:32:03,066 --> 01:32:04,503
You know that, don't you?

1158
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:06,244
She'll cut them down
without a second thought.

1159
01:32:06,331 --> 01:32:08,550
And she's coming, Abra.

1160
01:32:08,637 --> 01:32:10,335
They need to know.

1161
01:32:15,122 --> 01:32:17,385
So, what's this stop
we gotta make?

1162
01:32:17,472 --> 01:32:19,735
You still got
those old deer rifles?

1163
01:32:37,187 --> 01:32:38,754
You're Uncle Dan?

1164
01:32:38,841 --> 01:32:40,365
-The fuck you think you are?
-Sir...

1165
01:32:40,452 --> 01:32:42,367
Hmm? She is 13 years old!

1166
01:32:42,454 --> 01:32:43,846
Abra, I told you to show him.

1167
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:45,631
-I told him.
-Well, that's not the same.

1168
01:32:45,718 --> 01:32:46,936
I'm gonna kick your ass
before I call the police, huh?

1169
01:32:47,023 --> 01:32:48,155
-Hey, hey, hey!
-No, no, no. Abra.

1170
01:32:48,242 --> 01:32:49,243
Now, don't you say her name.

1171
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:51,332
Abra...

1172
01:33:05,172 --> 01:33:08,480
I'm sorry, Mr. Stone.
I am a friend.

1173
01:33:08,567 --> 01:33:10,917
Everything she told you
is true.

1174
01:33:22,581 --> 01:33:23,669
No, thanks.

1175
01:33:23,756 --> 01:33:24,757
No.

1176
01:33:34,201 --> 01:33:35,898
Those people,

1177
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:38,945
they know about my daughter?

1178
01:33:39,032 --> 01:33:40,729
They do.

1179
01:33:40,816 --> 01:33:43,428
And sooner or later,
they're coming.

1180
01:33:43,515 --> 01:33:44,951
We gotta do something.

1181
01:33:45,038 --> 01:33:46,909
All right, we're calling
the police, the FBI...

1182
01:33:46,996 --> 01:33:49,651
These people have been
around a long, long time, sir.

1183
01:33:49,738 --> 01:33:51,392
They're rich, connected.

1184
01:33:51,479 --> 01:33:53,786
I don't think they're worried
about the police.

1185
01:33:53,873 --> 01:33:55,309
But where are they?

1186
01:33:55,396 --> 01:33:57,703
When are they coming?
Where can we go?

1187
01:33:57,790 --> 01:33:59,618
Abra can answer that,

1188
01:33:59,705 --> 01:34:01,271
if she's ready.

1189
01:34:02,272 --> 01:34:04,013
I'm ready.

1190
01:34:13,327 --> 01:34:15,198
You sure you wanna do this?

1191
01:34:15,285 --> 01:34:16,896
I have to.

1192
01:34:58,981 --> 01:35:00,635
I-95.

1193
01:35:00,722 --> 01:35:03,551
Barry, the Crow, the Snake,
and a few others.

1194
01:35:03,638 --> 01:35:04,900
The trees haven't
changed that much,

1195
01:35:04,987 --> 01:35:06,946
so maybe Massachusetts,

1196
01:35:07,033 --> 01:35:09,557
-but they're close.
-Rose?

1197
01:35:09,644 --> 01:35:11,341
Didn't see her.

1198
01:35:11,429 --> 01:35:12,691
But they're coming.

1199
01:35:16,651 --> 01:35:19,219
This is the only room she saw?

1200
01:35:19,306 --> 01:35:20,655
That's right.

1201
01:35:20,742 --> 01:35:23,832
And I made a few changes.
Hid a few things.

1202
01:35:23,919 --> 01:35:25,921
All right.

1203
01:35:26,008 --> 01:35:28,271
Well, they'll be trying
to track you,

1204
01:35:28,358 --> 01:35:30,099
trying to catch on.

1205
01:35:31,797 --> 01:35:34,408
And you're gonna let them.

1206
01:35:34,495 --> 01:35:36,105
Are you crazy?

1207
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:38,456
Possibly, but you're
gonna let them,

1208
01:35:38,543 --> 01:35:40,980
and then I need you to try
and do a little trick.

1209
01:35:41,807 --> 01:35:43,199
A magic trick?

1210
01:35:51,164 --> 01:35:52,992
They're following us.

1211
01:35:53,079 --> 01:35:55,255
Concentrate. You gotta
keep it up until they land.

1212
01:35:56,082 --> 01:35:57,126
I know.

1213
01:36:28,897 --> 01:36:30,333
This should work.

1214
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:33,119
Good blinds over there,
and there.

1215
01:36:36,165 --> 01:36:37,253
They still close?

1216
01:36:37,340 --> 01:36:39,125
Getting closer, I think.

1217
01:36:39,212 --> 01:36:40,387
This is tough.

1218
01:36:40,474 --> 01:36:42,998
I know. I know.
How much longer?

1219
01:36:46,654 --> 01:36:48,351
Okay, Crow Daddy,

1220
01:36:49,135 --> 01:36:51,093
go get her.

1221
01:37:37,575 --> 01:37:39,968
You look relaxed.

1222
01:37:40,055 --> 01:37:43,189
You feel relaxed,
don't you, Abra?

1223
01:37:43,798 --> 01:37:44,886
I guess.

1224
01:37:44,973 --> 01:37:46,714
You should.

1225
01:37:46,801 --> 01:37:48,368
Just relax.

1226
01:37:48,455 --> 01:37:50,239
We're friends.

1227
01:37:50,326 --> 01:37:51,937
You're friends.

1228
01:37:52,024 --> 01:37:53,460
That's right.

1229
01:37:54,243 --> 01:37:56,289
Just friends.

1230
01:37:56,376 --> 01:38:01,033
And we want to take you
to meet more friends.

1231
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:02,600
Good friends.

1232
01:38:06,734 --> 01:38:08,170
Well, shit.

1233
01:38:08,257 --> 01:38:09,824
The way they talked you up,

1234
01:38:09,911 --> 01:38:11,521
I was thinking it'd be
a little harder than that.

1235
01:38:16,614 --> 01:38:18,180
The fuck?

1236
01:38:18,267 --> 01:38:20,792
Parlor tricks.
Just fuckin' parlor tricks.

1237
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:26,667
No! Get out of there!

1238
01:38:26,754 --> 01:38:27,755
Get out of there!

1239
01:38:34,457 --> 01:38:35,807
-No!

1240
01:38:49,864 --> 01:38:50,865
No!

1241
01:39:00,005 --> 01:39:01,659
You deserve it.

1242
01:39:01,746 --> 01:39:04,487
You deserve it.
All of you.

1243
01:39:09,579 --> 01:39:10,580
No!

1244
01:40:06,114 --> 01:40:07,463
Oh, fuck.

1245
01:40:09,291 --> 01:40:10,292
Stop.

1246
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:18,126
I just got one question
for you, sweetie.

1247
01:40:19,258 --> 01:40:20,912
Aren't you sleepy?

1248
01:40:23,697 --> 01:40:25,438
You're sleepy.

1249
01:40:30,269 --> 01:40:31,357
Sleep.

1250
01:40:33,228 --> 01:40:34,229
Sleep.

1251
01:40:36,144 --> 01:40:38,625
Wake up! Uncle Dan!

1252
01:40:38,712 --> 01:40:40,888
Wake up! Wake up.

1253
01:40:40,975 --> 01:40:43,456
-Wake up!

1254
01:40:43,543 --> 01:40:45,414
Fucking men.

1255
01:40:46,894 --> 01:40:48,766
-Fucking men.

1256
01:41:04,956 --> 01:41:06,305
Stay back, Billy.

1257
01:41:09,612 --> 01:41:11,353
Kill yourself.

1258
01:41:13,878 --> 01:41:15,053
No!

1259
01:41:15,140 --> 01:41:16,315
-Billy!

1260
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:35,160
There is one missing.

1261
01:41:35,247 --> 01:41:36,770
I didn't see the Crow.

1262
01:41:36,857 --> 01:41:38,380
Where is the Crow?

1263
01:41:40,295 --> 01:41:41,514
Hello, Abra.

1264
01:41:47,563 --> 01:41:49,522
Abra!

1265
01:42:22,033 --> 01:42:24,557
Oh, good, you're awake.

1266
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:35,437
Dan...

1267
01:42:35,524 --> 01:42:37,004
Don't bother.

1268
01:42:44,055 --> 01:42:46,013
What's wrong with me?

1269
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:48,233
You've been dosed, missy.

1270
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,713
More than
I've ever used before.

1271
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:53,499
Might let you wake up
here and there,

1272
01:42:53,586 --> 01:42:55,762
but that steam of yours
is fast asleep.

1273
01:42:58,939 --> 01:43:01,376
My dad...

1274
01:43:01,463 --> 01:43:03,378
What happened to my dad?

1275
01:43:03,465 --> 01:43:05,946
Lot of good people
killed today.

1276
01:43:06,033 --> 01:43:09,036
Lot of good people.

1277
01:43:09,123 --> 01:43:11,517
I'd love to tell you
someone will pay,

1278
01:43:11,604 --> 01:43:15,303
some kind of justice raining
down on the sad events today,

1279
01:43:16,522 --> 01:43:18,828
but it don't work like that.

1280
01:43:18,916 --> 01:43:21,831
We were always gonna have you.

1281
01:43:21,919 --> 01:43:24,443
Some of my people are dead.

1282
01:43:24,530 --> 01:43:26,924
Some of yours are dead.

1283
01:43:27,011 --> 01:43:30,231
Outcome didn't change, though.

1284
01:43:30,318 --> 01:43:32,494
Think on that a minute.

1285
01:43:32,581 --> 01:43:34,844
The outcome didn't change.

1286
01:43:34,932 --> 01:43:36,368
So, their deaths,

1287
01:43:37,238 --> 01:43:39,066
all of them,

1288
01:43:39,153 --> 01:43:41,329
just a waste.

1289
01:43:41,416 --> 01:43:44,767
A waste you brought on
to us all, young lady.

1290
01:43:44,854 --> 01:43:46,334
For what?

1291
01:43:47,814 --> 01:43:49,772
Please hear me...

1292
01:43:49,859 --> 01:43:52,427
Ain't nobody hearing you.

1293
01:43:52,514 --> 01:43:56,214
Might as well calm down
and enjoy the ride.

1294
01:43:56,301 --> 01:43:58,433
Like I said,

1295
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:00,870
outcome hasn't changed.

1296
01:44:21,065 --> 01:44:22,457
No.

1297
01:44:23,937 --> 01:44:25,634
Please.

1298
01:44:25,721 --> 01:44:28,202
Oh, please, please, please.

1299
01:44:29,073 --> 01:44:30,596
Please.

1300
01:44:33,729 --> 01:44:35,557
Abra!

1301
01:44:38,430 --> 01:44:40,084
Abra.

1302
01:44:46,742 --> 01:44:47,961
Tony?

1303
01:44:50,007 --> 01:44:52,574
Help me, please, Tony.

1304
01:44:57,710 --> 01:44:59,016
God.

1305
01:45:09,461 --> 01:45:11,506
Okay. Okay.

1306
01:45:11,593 --> 01:45:13,030
Okay, okay.

1307
01:45:13,117 --> 01:45:15,554
Okay, you always said...

1308
01:45:15,641 --> 01:45:17,295
your brain was like a radio.

1309
01:45:17,382 --> 01:45:20,124
No one's answering when
you call, so stop calling.

1310
01:45:20,211 --> 01:45:22,169
And just listen.

1311
01:45:39,317 --> 01:45:41,536
Dan. Dan.

1312
01:45:41,623 --> 01:45:42,624
Help.

1313
01:45:57,117 --> 01:45:58,336
Hi.

1314
01:45:58,423 --> 01:46:00,164
Dan.

1315
01:46:02,514 --> 01:46:04,037
Did he drug you?

1316
01:46:05,299 --> 01:46:08,041
I'm so sorry.

1317
01:46:08,128 --> 01:46:10,087
I'm gonna try something, okay?

1318
01:46:10,174 --> 01:46:11,262
But you're weak.

1319
01:46:11,349 --> 01:46:12,959
He's blocking you.

1320
01:46:13,046 --> 01:46:15,527
I could barely hear you.

1321
01:46:15,614 --> 01:46:17,355
You gotta trust me, okay?

1322
01:46:18,573 --> 01:46:20,097
Okay?

1323
01:46:33,936 --> 01:46:37,070
Awake again, huh?

1324
01:46:37,157 --> 01:46:40,117
Might have to dose you
at the next rest stop.

1325
01:46:41,727 --> 01:46:43,511
Where are we going?

1326
01:46:43,598 --> 01:46:46,427
Mmm, you know where.

1327
01:46:46,514 --> 01:46:48,995
Fuck, I feel hungover.

1328
01:46:51,258 --> 01:46:53,782
I told you it's good shit.

1329
01:46:53,869 --> 01:46:55,697
Haven't felt hungover
in years.

1330
01:46:55,784 --> 01:46:57,046
And, you know,
I don't miss it.

1331
01:46:57,134 --> 01:46:58,570
Not even a little.

1332
01:47:00,528 --> 01:47:02,313
West, huh?

1333
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:05,272
Stayin' off the major roads.
Smart.

1334
01:47:07,622 --> 01:47:10,147
Crownville. New York.

1335
01:47:13,019 --> 01:47:15,369
Who are you?

1336
01:47:15,456 --> 01:47:18,024
I'm the guy
that killed your friends.

1337
01:47:23,247 --> 01:47:25,292
It's nice to meet you.

1338
01:47:26,467 --> 01:47:28,077
Neat trick.

1339
01:47:28,165 --> 01:47:30,123
Haven't seen this one before.

1340
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:32,125
Wanna see one more?

1341
01:47:35,128 --> 01:47:38,827
Don't imagine Rose'll be too
happy if you shoot the prize.

1342
01:47:41,221 --> 01:47:44,790
I don't suppose Rose will be
happy about any of this.

1343
01:47:44,877 --> 01:47:47,488
And when that woman gets mad,

1344
01:47:47,575 --> 01:47:48,707
well,

1345
01:47:48,794 --> 01:47:50,187
it seems to me you know enough

1346
01:47:50,274 --> 01:47:52,841
to know you might
wanna sit this one out.

1347
01:47:52,928 --> 01:47:54,626
Count your blessings.

1348
01:47:54,713 --> 01:47:55,670
Go on your way.

1349
01:47:58,543 --> 01:48:00,240
What's so funny, friend?

1350
01:48:00,327 --> 01:48:04,244
Well, it's just arrogance.
It's arrogance, really.

1351
01:48:04,331 --> 01:48:05,680
But it makes sense,

1352
01:48:05,767 --> 01:48:07,682
if you think
you're gonna live forever.

1353
01:48:07,769 --> 01:48:09,945
Stands to reason,

1354
01:48:10,032 --> 01:48:12,165
of course you wouldn't
wear your seatbelt.

1355
01:48:21,827 --> 01:48:24,960
No!

1356
01:48:35,362 --> 01:48:37,059
Dan?

1357
01:48:38,147 --> 01:48:39,279
Dan?

1358
01:49:10,702 --> 01:49:12,791
I hope that hurts.

1359
01:49:12,878 --> 01:49:14,923
Rosie...

1360
01:49:15,010 --> 01:49:16,838
A lot.

1361
01:50:03,972 --> 01:50:06,323
You little bitch.

1362
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:10,544
What have you done?

1363
01:50:21,903 --> 01:50:24,123
All right, bitch child.

1364
01:50:24,776 --> 01:50:25,733
All right.

1365
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:35,020
Sorry.

1366
01:51:35,107 --> 01:51:36,238
Dozed off.

1367
01:51:36,325 --> 01:51:39,024
No, you earned it.

1368
01:51:41,592 --> 01:51:42,767
Where are we?

1369
01:51:42,854 --> 01:51:44,725
Ohio.

1370
01:51:44,812 --> 01:51:45,857
Where are we going?

1371
01:51:45,944 --> 01:51:47,162
Colorado.

1372
01:51:48,468 --> 01:51:50,601
Why Colorado?

1373
01:51:52,820 --> 01:51:55,388
She's gonna keep coming.

1374
01:51:55,475 --> 01:51:58,347
-I know.
-Always.

1375
01:51:58,435 --> 01:52:00,219
This only ends if we end it,

1376
01:52:00,306 --> 01:52:02,264
and I don't think
we can beat her.

1377
01:52:02,351 --> 01:52:04,353
Not by ourselves.

1378
01:52:06,138 --> 01:52:07,574
There's a place.

1379
01:52:07,661 --> 01:52:10,447
A place that's dangerous
for people like us.

1380
01:52:10,534 --> 01:52:13,580
The place you told me about?
The hungry place?

1381
01:52:13,667 --> 01:52:15,147
Yeah, that's right.

1382
01:52:15,234 --> 01:52:18,280
If it's so dangerous,
why would we go there?

1383
01:52:18,367 --> 01:52:20,413
Well, if it's dangerous
for people like us,

1384
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:23,547
I expect it's dangerous
for people like her.

1385
01:52:23,634 --> 01:52:25,418
Maybe even more so.

1386
01:52:26,419 --> 01:52:28,334
Good.

1387
01:52:28,421 --> 01:52:31,250
She's following us, you know.

1388
01:52:31,337 --> 01:52:33,687
Yeah, good. Let her.

1389
01:52:40,955 --> 01:52:43,349
I'm sorry about your father.

1390
01:52:45,220 --> 01:52:47,658
Sorry about your friend.

1391
01:53:09,636 --> 01:53:11,899
It's my mom.

1392
01:53:11,986 --> 01:53:14,162
What do I say to her?

1393
01:53:18,123 --> 01:53:19,124
Hi, Mom.

1394
01:53:19,211 --> 01:53:20,429
Oh, thank God!

1395
01:53:20,517 --> 01:53:21,648
Abra,

1396
01:53:21,735 --> 01:53:23,476
are you okay?
Where are you?

1397
01:53:24,346 --> 01:53:26,044
I love you.

1398
01:53:28,481 --> 01:53:30,004
When we're safe,

1399
01:53:30,091 --> 01:53:30,962
you'll call her
and tell her where to find us?

1400
01:53:31,049 --> 01:53:32,093
I will.

1401
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:33,399
Okay.

1402
01:54:07,389 --> 01:54:09,609
Not too much further.
Up the mountain.

1403
01:55:45,183 --> 01:55:46,880
Here's what we're gonna do.

1404
01:55:46,967 --> 01:55:49,796
You're gonna stay in the car,
keep the heater running.

1405
01:55:49,883 --> 01:55:51,755
I don't want you spending
a minute inside there

1406
01:55:51,842 --> 01:55:53,060
if you don't have to.

1407
01:55:53,147 --> 01:55:54,801
She can only come from here.

1408
01:55:54,888 --> 01:55:56,324
You can see her
a mile out, easy.

1409
01:55:56,411 --> 01:55:58,718
You see lights
on the mountain over there,

1410
01:55:58,805 --> 01:56:00,459
you blast me, okay?

1411
01:56:00,546 --> 01:56:03,592
But I don't want you going in.
Not until she's here.

1412
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:06,073
You aren't waiting with me?

1413
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:07,248
I can't.

1414
01:56:07,335 --> 01:56:09,120
Why not?

1415
01:56:09,207 --> 01:56:11,122
I have to wake it up.

1416
01:57:12,661 --> 01:57:14,663
Wakey-wakey.

1417
02:01:27,829 --> 02:01:29,701
Slow night, Mr. Torrance.

1418
02:01:29,788 --> 02:01:33,313
Not for long, I imagine.

1419
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:35,402
You're a whiskey man,
are you not?

1420
02:01:35,489 --> 02:01:37,796
I was, most of the time.

1421
02:01:45,238 --> 02:01:47,066
On the house.

1422
02:01:50,461 --> 02:01:52,593
This was your brand.

1423
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:54,247
Jack Daniel's.

1424
02:01:54,334 --> 02:01:56,771
I used to see the bottles
in our home.

1425
02:01:56,858 --> 02:02:00,210
Our real home,
before all this.

1426
02:02:00,297 --> 02:02:03,517
I smelled one once. It smelled
like something on fire,

1427
02:02:04,736 --> 02:02:07,434
which I suppose it was.

1428
02:02:07,521 --> 02:02:09,871
I'm afraid you've
confused me with someone else.

1429
02:02:09,958 --> 02:02:12,135
It's Lloyd.

1430
02:02:12,222 --> 02:02:13,571
Lloyd.

1431
02:02:14,702 --> 02:02:16,791
I apologize, Mr. Torrance.

1432
02:02:16,878 --> 02:02:18,358
I don't know
where everyone is,

1433
02:02:18,445 --> 02:02:20,752
but it'll pick up.

1434
02:02:20,839 --> 02:02:22,623
Oh, I know where they are.

1435
02:02:22,710 --> 02:02:24,277
And you're right,

1436
02:02:25,148 --> 02:02:26,453
it'll pick up.

1437
02:02:28,238 --> 02:02:31,719
If you don't mind my saying,
Mr. Torrance, you seem...

1438
02:02:32,459 --> 02:02:33,895
put upon.

1439
02:02:34,505 --> 02:02:36,202
Put upon?

1440
02:02:36,289 --> 02:02:37,899
Pulled into
other people's problems.

1441
02:02:37,986 --> 02:02:41,207
I see it all the time,
if you don't mind my saying.

1442
02:02:43,775 --> 02:02:46,038
So we lived in Florida.

1443
02:02:46,647 --> 02:02:47,735
I'm sorry?

1444
02:02:47,822 --> 02:02:49,215
Mom and I.

1445
02:02:51,043 --> 02:02:54,046
We never wanted
to see snow again,

1446
02:02:54,133 --> 02:02:56,004
so we lived in Florida.

1447
02:02:56,092 --> 02:02:57,441
Tiny place,

1448
02:02:57,528 --> 02:02:58,659
but it was comfortable,
and we were happy.

1449
02:03:01,053 --> 02:03:03,403
I was 20 when she died.

1450
02:03:03,490 --> 02:03:07,190
And back then, I saw
when someone was gonna die.

1451
02:03:07,277 --> 02:03:09,540
I saw flies. Black flies.

1452
02:03:09,627 --> 02:03:13,283
"Death flies," I called them,
circling people's faces.

1453
02:03:13,370 --> 02:03:16,068
And in those last weeks,
she was covered,

1454
02:03:16,155 --> 02:03:17,939
her whole face.

1455
02:03:18,026 --> 02:03:21,204
I could barely see her eyes.

1456
02:03:21,291 --> 02:03:24,120
And I...
And I tried to comfort her,

1457
02:03:24,207 --> 02:03:26,034
but I could hardly
look at her.

1458
02:03:26,122 --> 02:03:28,254
And she saw that.

1459
02:03:33,390 --> 02:03:36,828
Maybe something warm to push
away such unpleasantries.

1460
02:03:36,915 --> 02:03:40,048
Don't you wanna hear about it?
She was your wife.

1461
02:03:40,136 --> 02:03:43,182
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

1462
02:03:43,269 --> 02:03:45,141
-I'm just a bartender.
-Oh, yeah?

1463
02:03:46,664 --> 02:03:48,013
Just Lloyd the bartender,

1464
02:03:48,100 --> 02:03:49,667
pouring joy
at the Overlook Hotel.

1465
02:03:49,754 --> 02:03:52,800
I'll pour whatever you like,
Mr. Torrance.

1466
02:03:59,677 --> 02:04:01,592
Man takes a drink,

1467
02:04:02,636 --> 02:04:05,204
the drink takes a drink,

1468
02:04:05,291 --> 02:04:07,989
and then the drink
takes a man.

1469
02:04:08,076 --> 02:04:09,861
Ain't it so, Dad?

1470
02:04:13,908 --> 02:04:15,867
Medicine.

1471
02:04:16,868 --> 02:04:19,697
Medicine is what it is.

1472
02:04:19,784 --> 02:04:22,526
Bona fide cure-all.

1473
02:04:22,613 --> 02:04:25,398
The mind is a blackboard.

1474
02:04:25,485 --> 02:04:27,139
And this...

1475
02:04:27,226 --> 02:04:28,967
is the eraser.

1476
02:04:33,841 --> 02:04:36,192
A man tries.

1477
02:04:36,279 --> 02:04:38,498
He provides.

1478
02:04:38,585 --> 02:04:41,066
But he's surrounded by mouths.

1479
02:04:41,153 --> 02:04:43,111
And a family.

1480
02:04:43,199 --> 02:04:46,463
A wife, a kid.

1481
02:04:46,550 --> 02:04:48,987
Those mouths eat time.

1482
02:04:49,074 --> 02:04:50,815
They eat your days on earth.

1483
02:04:52,033 --> 02:04:53,296
They just gobble them up.

1484
02:04:55,254 --> 02:04:58,562
It's enough
to make a man sick.

1485
02:04:58,649 --> 02:04:59,606
And this...

1486
02:05:00,825 --> 02:05:02,783
is the medicine.

1487
02:05:05,046 --> 02:05:07,962
So, tell me, pup,

1488
02:05:08,049 --> 02:05:11,096
are you gonna
take your medicine?

1489
02:05:14,708 --> 02:05:15,709
I'm not.

1490
02:05:18,843 --> 02:05:20,105
Dan!

1491
02:05:20,192 --> 02:05:21,628
She's here.

1492
02:05:39,385 --> 02:05:41,300
Okay.

1493
02:05:55,271 --> 02:05:57,751
This place is sick.

1494
02:05:57,838 --> 02:06:00,232
Sick like my momo was sick.

1495
02:06:00,319 --> 02:06:02,103
It's cancer,

1496
02:06:02,190 --> 02:06:03,627
only worse.

1497
02:06:11,635 --> 02:06:12,940
What do we do now?

1498
02:06:13,027 --> 02:06:15,291
We head inside.
She'll find us.

1499
02:08:05,183 --> 02:08:07,141
Well, well, well.

1500
02:08:09,230 --> 02:08:10,971
Hi there.

1501
02:08:11,058 --> 02:08:14,148
When this starts, run.

1502
02:08:14,235 --> 02:08:17,021
Yes, you run, dear.

1503
02:08:17,108 --> 02:08:19,545
And then I will find you,

1504
02:08:19,632 --> 02:08:25,421
and you will scream for years
until you die.

1505
02:08:25,508 --> 02:08:28,162
We'll see who does
the screaming.

1506
02:08:28,249 --> 02:08:29,773
Oh, we'll see indeed.

1507
02:08:29,860 --> 02:08:31,818
She's right, you know.

1508
02:08:31,905 --> 02:08:33,907
You should be afraid.

1509
02:08:34,734 --> 02:08:36,910
Why is that?

1510
02:08:36,997 --> 02:08:39,652
Because you don't know
where you're standing.

1511
02:08:39,739 --> 02:08:42,612
I'm sorry, who are you,
handsome?

1512
02:08:46,267 --> 02:08:49,532
You're the one who killed
my Crow, aren't you?

1513
02:08:50,620 --> 02:08:51,577
Go.

1514
02:09:53,160 --> 02:09:55,511
Clever.

1515
02:09:55,598 --> 02:09:57,425
You've made some improvements,
haven't you?

1516
02:09:58,905 --> 02:10:01,647
Since the last time
I was in your mind.

1517
02:10:01,734 --> 02:10:03,997
How do you know
we're not in yours?

1518
02:10:18,098 --> 02:10:19,360
Where are you, pup?

1519
02:10:40,207 --> 02:10:41,731
You're gonna die here.

1520
02:10:42,775 --> 02:10:45,865
Mmm. Brave words, dear.

1521
02:10:45,952 --> 02:10:48,215
Is that what you really think?

1522
02:10:48,302 --> 02:10:50,391
You're gonna hurt me?

1523
02:10:50,478 --> 02:10:51,871
Yes.

1524
02:10:58,791 --> 02:11:02,012
You know,
you remind me of myself.

1525
02:11:03,622 --> 02:11:05,755
I can really see it now.

1526
02:11:05,842 --> 02:11:08,409
You've got a darkness
in you, dear.

1527
02:11:08,496 --> 02:11:11,935
I think the only difference
between you and me is time.

1528
02:11:21,553 --> 02:11:22,598
You don't know yet

1529
02:11:23,511 --> 02:11:24,512
what you'd do...

1530
02:11:25,775 --> 02:11:26,819
for more time.

1531
02:11:28,865 --> 02:11:32,259
But I promise you, dear,
oh, you'd be surprised.

1532
02:11:37,787 --> 02:11:39,615
Pain purifies steam.

1533
02:11:40,833 --> 02:11:44,620
Fear, too, so, you understand.

1534
02:11:57,458 --> 02:11:58,808
Hmm.

1535
02:12:04,291 --> 02:12:06,859
I was just like you
when I was younger.

1536
02:12:06,946 --> 02:12:09,427
I was special,

1537
02:12:09,514 --> 02:12:10,907
and alone.

1538
02:12:10,994 --> 02:12:12,473
But I met someone who gave me

1539
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:14,171
the gift of purpose,
of community,

1540
02:12:14,258 --> 02:12:15,738
and I might have
given you such a gift

1541
02:12:15,825 --> 02:12:19,219
if things would have
gone differently.

1542
02:12:22,092 --> 02:12:23,963
No?

1543
02:12:24,050 --> 02:12:25,965
Defiant, aren't you?

1544
02:12:27,227 --> 02:12:28,751
So much like me.

1545
02:12:28,838 --> 02:12:31,275
Your mind is so...

1546
02:12:34,234 --> 02:12:36,367
This isn't your mind, is it?

1547
02:12:38,891 --> 02:12:41,241
This isn't you at all.

1548
02:12:42,852 --> 02:12:45,376
You're just the bait.

1549
02:12:48,771 --> 02:12:49,728
Enough!

1550
02:12:53,123 --> 02:12:54,080
Run.

1551
02:12:56,517 --> 02:12:59,042
How the hell did we miss you?

1552
02:13:00,608 --> 02:13:01,958
Oh...

1553
02:13:02,045 --> 02:13:04,569
You and I should have
met years ago.

1554
02:13:07,833 --> 02:13:08,791
Danny.

1555
02:13:10,314 --> 02:13:13,970
That's your name, isn't it?

1556
02:13:14,057 --> 02:13:15,623
Well, something happens
to the steam

1557
02:13:15,711 --> 02:13:17,713
when you rubes get older.

1558
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:19,802
It gets polluted.

1559
02:13:19,889 --> 02:13:21,542
Dirty.

1560
02:13:21,629 --> 02:13:22,718
You know that.

1561
02:13:23,980 --> 02:13:26,809
I see the grease all over you.

1562
02:13:26,896 --> 02:13:29,768
You don't shine
quite the same.

1563
02:13:29,855 --> 02:13:32,249
Growing up spoils that,
I guess.

1564
02:13:34,425 --> 02:13:36,557
Seriously, handsome,

1565
02:13:36,644 --> 02:13:39,169
where have you been hiding?

1566
02:13:42,128 --> 02:13:44,174
I can make you an offer.

1567
02:13:45,392 --> 02:13:47,133
An offer I rarely make.

1568
02:13:47,220 --> 02:13:49,745
Oh, yeah? I can't wait.

1569
02:13:49,832 --> 02:13:51,355
Such a gifted boy,

1570
02:13:51,442 --> 02:13:55,533
hiding his light
under a bushel for so long.

1571
02:13:55,620 --> 02:13:59,929
You could live a long,
long time. Live well, too.

1572
02:14:00,016 --> 02:14:04,237
Indulge yourself,
no consequences,

1573
02:14:04,324 --> 02:14:05,325
no hangovers.

1574
02:14:07,850 --> 02:14:10,504
Eat well, live long.

1575
02:14:10,591 --> 02:14:13,377
You must be lonely,
being the last one.

1576
02:14:13,464 --> 02:14:15,640
I mean,
the last one in the world.

1577
02:14:15,727 --> 02:14:18,208
Sweetie, I'm not the last.
Far from it.

1578
02:14:19,426 --> 02:14:21,167
I'm just the prettiest.

1579
02:14:21,254 --> 02:14:23,300
I assume you know my answer.

1580
02:14:25,041 --> 02:14:26,129
Pity.

1581
02:14:26,216 --> 02:14:27,870
So, are we doing this or not?

1582
02:14:44,538 --> 02:14:46,018
Whew.

1583
02:14:48,412 --> 02:14:50,762
Oh, sweetie.

1584
02:14:50,849 --> 02:14:54,461
-Oh, look at that, huh?

1585
02:14:54,548 --> 02:14:58,726
I seem to have nicked
your femoral artery there.

1586
02:14:58,814 --> 02:15:01,381
Why, you're gonna
bleed to death, huh?

1587
02:15:07,083 --> 02:15:09,041
My, my,
what a temper you have.

1588
02:15:09,128 --> 02:15:10,216
So much fire.

1589
02:15:11,087 --> 02:15:12,697
Such a waste!

1590
02:15:12,784 --> 02:15:14,307
Or maybe not.

1591
02:15:21,401 --> 02:15:23,795
Oh, damn.

1592
02:15:23,882 --> 02:15:26,276
Even at your age...

1593
02:15:26,363 --> 02:15:27,930
it's so good.

1594
02:15:33,065 --> 02:15:35,024
You taste like whiskey.

1595
02:15:40,333 --> 02:15:41,813
Danny!

1596
02:15:42,640 --> 02:15:43,902
Danny boy!

1597
02:15:45,121 --> 02:15:47,558
Oh, so much terror.

1598
02:15:47,645 --> 02:15:49,299
All your life, huh?

1599
02:15:51,736 --> 02:15:53,433
Delicious.

1600
02:15:59,309 --> 02:16:01,746
Don't hurt me!

1601
02:16:03,400 --> 02:16:04,401
Oh, damn.

1602
02:16:09,188 --> 02:16:10,450
What are...
You're not alone in there.

1603
02:16:10,537 --> 02:16:11,756
-Huh?

1604
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:14,150
What are you hiding, huh?

1605
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:18,328
What's in those?

1606
02:16:18,415 --> 02:16:19,895
Something special, huh?

1607
02:16:19,982 --> 02:16:23,420
They're not special.
They're starving.

1608
02:16:32,342 --> 02:16:33,473
No.

1609
02:16:33,560 --> 02:16:35,519
No!

1610
02:17:12,512 --> 02:17:14,340
Hello, Danny.

1611
02:17:16,386 --> 02:17:18,866
Come and play with us...

1612
02:17:19,998 --> 02:17:21,521
forever...

1613
02:17:21,608 --> 02:17:24,133
-...and ever...

1614
02:17:25,308 --> 02:17:27,092
and ever.

1615
02:18:01,518 --> 02:18:03,824
Uncle Dan.

1616
02:18:03,911 --> 02:18:05,565
Uncle Dan, is it done?

1617
02:18:05,652 --> 02:18:07,959
-Is she dead?

1618
02:18:29,937 --> 02:18:32,288
Great party, isn't it?

1619
02:18:32,375 --> 02:18:33,724
Abra!

1620
02:18:37,380 --> 02:18:38,816
Abra!

1621
02:18:55,050 --> 02:18:56,442
Abra!

1622
02:19:02,840 --> 02:19:04,276
Abra!

1623
02:19:22,816 --> 02:19:24,122
Try it.

1624
02:19:27,212 --> 02:19:28,561
Oh, there you are.

1625
02:19:28,648 --> 02:19:29,954
Abra.

1626
02:19:31,129 --> 02:19:33,784
You've been very, very bad.

1627
02:19:33,871 --> 02:19:35,960
You're not Uncle Dan.

1628
02:19:36,047 --> 02:19:40,182
You're a mask. A false face.

1629
02:19:40,269 --> 02:19:41,444
Who else would I be?

1630
02:19:41,531 --> 02:19:42,488
You're the hotel.

1631
02:19:43,359 --> 02:19:44,751
But he's still in there.

1632
02:19:44,838 --> 02:19:46,536
Mask is off, then.

1633
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:53,369
Why are you smiling?

1634
02:19:53,456 --> 02:19:55,588
Because you don't know
where you're standing.

1635
02:19:55,675 --> 02:19:59,462
I know these halls
like my own face, child.

1636
02:19:59,549 --> 02:20:01,725
I mean the body
you're standing in.

1637
02:20:01,812 --> 02:20:03,379
The face you're wearing.

1638
02:20:03,466 --> 02:20:05,642
That's Dan Torrance,
and you don't know him.

1639
02:20:05,729 --> 02:20:07,383
Dan Torrance.

1640
02:20:07,470 --> 02:20:08,862
Dan Torrance

1641
02:20:08,949 --> 02:20:11,909
made one stop
as soon as he got here.

1642
02:20:11,996 --> 02:20:13,476
To the boiler room.

1643
02:20:38,414 --> 02:20:41,982
-There you are.

1644
02:20:42,069 --> 02:20:43,767
You were supposed to run.

1645
02:20:43,854 --> 02:20:45,377
I didn't wanna leave you.

1646
02:20:48,337 --> 02:20:51,992
I'm exactly where
I'm supposed to be.

1647
02:20:52,079 --> 02:20:53,559
I can't hold it off
for much longer.

1648
02:20:53,646 --> 02:20:54,778
Abra, you need to run.

1649
02:20:54,865 --> 02:20:56,171
No.

1650
02:20:56,258 --> 02:20:57,737
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

1651
02:20:57,824 --> 02:21:00,218
I have to close the door
behind us, right?

1652
02:21:01,176 --> 02:21:02,699
Run! Run!

1653
02:23:17,050 --> 02:23:18,138
Come on, Uncle Dan.

1654
02:23:18,922 --> 02:23:20,227
Get out of there.

1655
02:23:21,533 --> 02:23:22,752
Come on.

1656
02:23:34,329 --> 02:23:36,635
The fire spread fast,

1657
02:23:36,722 --> 02:23:38,637
destroying the hotel.

1658
02:23:38,724 --> 02:23:40,291
Purifying it.

1659
02:23:41,727 --> 02:23:43,729
I could almost hear it

1660
02:23:43,816 --> 02:23:45,122
screaming.

1661
02:23:46,166 --> 02:23:48,647
I could hear it dying.

1662
02:23:48,734 --> 02:23:51,476
And deep inside, I knew...

1663
02:23:54,305 --> 02:23:56,263
I knew you were okay.

1664
02:23:57,613 --> 02:24:00,529
I'm sorry I put you in danger.

1665
02:24:00,616 --> 02:24:02,095
It was the only way.

1666
02:24:03,009 --> 02:24:04,271
I know.

1667
02:24:05,403 --> 02:24:08,580
Do you think she was right

1668
02:24:08,667 --> 02:24:11,888
when she said
she wasn't the last one?

1669
02:24:11,975 --> 02:24:14,151
The world's a hungry place.

1670
02:24:14,238 --> 02:24:16,806
A dark place.

1671
02:24:16,893 --> 02:24:20,592
Maybe there's more of them
or things like them or worse,

1672
02:24:20,679 --> 02:24:23,116
but there are more people
like you, too.

1673
02:24:23,203 --> 02:24:24,901
People who stand.

1674
02:24:28,470 --> 02:24:30,123
I told you
when I first met you...

1675
02:24:30,210 --> 02:24:32,865
I told you
that you should hide.

1676
02:24:34,519 --> 02:24:36,434
That you should
keep your head down.

1677
02:24:37,566 --> 02:24:39,742
Keep your shine out of sight.

1678
02:24:41,483 --> 02:24:42,919
But I was wrong.

1679
02:24:46,183 --> 02:24:48,359
Shine on, Abra Stone.

1680
02:24:50,970 --> 02:24:52,363
You shine on.

1681
02:24:55,322 --> 02:24:57,063
- Dinner's ready.

1682
02:25:00,284 --> 02:25:02,025
Who are you talking to?

1683
02:25:03,983 --> 02:25:04,984
No one.

1684
02:25:05,637 --> 02:25:06,595
Hmm.

1685
02:25:13,253 --> 02:25:14,733
That's not true.

1686
02:25:18,737 --> 02:25:20,173
I was talking to Dan.

1687
02:25:28,094 --> 02:25:30,227
We go on after.

1688
02:25:31,054 --> 02:25:32,272
We go on.

1689
02:25:33,012 --> 02:25:34,449
And he's okay.

1690
02:25:35,275 --> 02:25:36,276
So is Daddy.

1691
02:25:37,887 --> 02:25:39,105
He really is.

1692
02:25:43,109 --> 02:25:44,502
Good.

1693
02:25:55,992 --> 02:25:57,341
You coming, sweetheart?

1694
02:26:00,083 --> 02:26:01,476
In a minute.

1694
02:26:02,305 --> 02:26:08,263
