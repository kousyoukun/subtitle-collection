it was always
just pictures to me.

138

walked through the door.

I'm sorry to tell you,

hungriest, and they'll eat what shines.

or leeches.

153

Can't do nothing about that.

What you can do...

155
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,817
is turn what they come for
against 'em.

Dark inside.

159
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,932
Same type of dark as your dad.

160
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:49,434
Beat me senseless,
and my grandma, too,

161
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:52,137
and when he died, I danced.

162
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,907
But he kept on coming back.

163
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,243
Standing in my room.

from whatever mold was
growin' on him in that box.

166
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,522
One day, he grabbed me,
and he was real.

167
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:12,891
His nails were long

168
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:14,293
from growing in the grave,

169
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:17,095
and they cut me, Doc.

170
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:18,898
Cut me deep.

00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:13,705
Excuse me, miss?

336
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,207
Miss. Miss, you left something
in the theater.

337
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,576
You wanna leave me alone.

338
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:27,285
Well, hi there.

339
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:29,988
You wanna let me go.

340
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:33,992
Oh, no, sweetie.

341
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:36,861
No, I don't.

342
00:26:47,204 --> 00:26:49,240

[indistinct PA chatter]

346
00:27:35,252 --> 00:27:37,255
How far can I get for this?

347
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:05,950
[man] Four of spades.
What color is this?

348
00:28:05,983 --> 00:28:08,920
Mommy, I made this for you.
It's a secret card.

349
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:10,788
[Lucy gasps] Mm,
thank you, Abba-doo.

350
00:28:10,821 --> 00:28:13,491
Does anyone know a magic word?

351
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:17,261
- [kids] Ooh, ooh.
- Uh... You.

352
00:28:17,294 --> 00:28:18,930
Abracadabra.

353
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,331
Abracadabra.
That's a great one.

354
00:28:20,364 --> 00:28:22,701
Okay, you hold the magic wand.

355
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:25,837
Now, everyone,

356
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,806
on the count of three, okay?

357
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:31,743
- One, two, three.
- [kids] Two, three.

358
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:35,213
Abracadabra.

359
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:37,248
I know magic, too.

360
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:41,419
Well, then you get to hold him,
birthday girl.

361
00:28:41,452 --> 00:28:44,856
- There you go. You got him?
- [David] Oh.

362
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,525
For my next trick...
Oh, my goodness. Sorry.

363
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:49,961
- Sometimes, if I...
- [kids exclaim and laugh]

364
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,497
- Sorry.
- [kid jeering]

365
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,932
Has anyone seen my spoons?

366
00:28:54,965 --> 00:28:56,768
I can do that.

367
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,336
That's nice, sweetie.

368
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,871
- [girl] They're on you!
- [magician] Oh, they're on me?

369
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,172
Okay, make sure you guys
don't do this.

370
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:03,341
- [inhales sharply] Oh!
- [kids exclaim]

371
00:29:13,217 --> 00:29:15,953
Uh... We can forget
about naptime.

372
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:17,789
- Just a few more hours.
- Mm.

373
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,159
[sighs heavily]

374
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,861
Say it with me.
"Just a few more hours."

375
00:29:23,894 --> 00:29:25,463
Just a few more hours.

376
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:33,204
[David] What the hell?

377
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:43,448
Dave...

378
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:58,062
[young Abra] Abracadabra.

379
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:09,374

00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,136
Oops.

384
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:41,205
Well, hi there, sleepyhead.

385
00:30:41,238 --> 00:30:42,907
Sorry.

386
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,276
I had to sleep you pretty hard.

387
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:47,278
You're a tough one.

388
00:30:47,311 --> 00:30:48,913
Willful.

389
00:30:48,946 --> 00:30:50,548
You know, I checked.

390
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:53,084
Six men in three months

391
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:56,487
with those little snakebite
tattoos on their cheeks.

392
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,356
Why, you've been busy.

393
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,629
[Rose gasps]

394
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:08,933
Snakebite Andi,
that's who you are.

395
00:31:08,966 --> 00:31:11,269
So, who am I?

396
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,474
You're some crazy bitch
who kidnapped me.

397
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,209
Just the truth from now on.

398
00:31:18,242 --> 00:31:20,345
You will only speak the truth.

399
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:26,183
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

400
00:31:26,216 --> 00:31:30,221
[laughs] My God. Works a little
too well, don't it?

401
00:31:30,254 --> 00:31:33,224
Here's the deal,
Snakebite Andi.

402
00:31:33,257 --> 00:31:36,961
You're a pusher, hmm?
You can push people.

403
00:31:36,994 --> 00:31:39,297
We haven't had a pusher
around here for a little while,

404
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:44,135
so I'm gonna offer you a deal I haven't
offered anyone in almost 40 years.

405
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,906
How old are you, darlin'?

406
00:31:49,373 --> 00:31:50,708
Fifteen.

407
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:52,510
Fifteen?

408
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:55,713
Oh, God, what an age.

409
00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:58,983
Springtime of your womanhood,
isn't it?

410
00:31:59,016 --> 00:32:01,986
Mm. You're not a girl anymore,

411
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:05,690
but you don't have
a single dent yet either.

412
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:08,259
Gravity hasn't even
noticed you.

413
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:10,428
Not at 15.

414
00:32:12,129 --> 00:32:13,264
Men, though...

415
00:32:14,698 --> 00:32:16,200
No, no, no. No shame.

416
00:32:17,634 --> 00:32:22,239
You paid that back, didn't you?

417
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,710
That's what I'm offering you.
Springtime forever.

418
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:28,145
Ten years from now,
you're still 15.

419
00:32:28,178 --> 00:32:30,448
A hundred, maybe 17.

420
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:33,551
Eat well,

421
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:37,388
stay young, live long.

422
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,460
So, you and your friend...

423
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:45,596
Mm, not my friend.
That's my family.

424
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:48,066
We're the True Knot, dear.

425
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,336
The True Knot.

426
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:56,507
What's tied
can never be untied.

427
00:34:10,414 --> 00:34:11,382
[man] You like it?

428
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:13,684
Oh. Sorry. I was just...

429
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:17,088
That's okay.
People love to look at it.

430
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:19,090
We used to set this up
in the library.

431
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:22,359
Community project,
just taking a life all its own.

432
00:34:22,392 --> 00:34:24,361
See, we started with
the clock tower there.

433
00:34:24,394 --> 00:34:27,098
- [Dan] Oh, yeah.
- [man] Just keeps growing.

434
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,532
Kids call it Teenytown.

435
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:29,834
The kids build this?

436
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,602
With some help, oh, yeah.

437
00:34:31,635 --> 00:34:34,372
Keep it up,
build the whole town square.

438
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:40,478
Are you off the bus
or riding your thumb?

439
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:41,812
Yeah, the bus.

440
00:34:41,845 --> 00:34:44,448
Oh. Not many ride the bus
this far north.

441
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:47,385
Unless they're looking
for work. [sniffs]

442
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,422
Yeah.

443
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:54,391
Change of scenery,

444
00:34:54,424 --> 00:34:57,095
or you running away
from something?

445
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,397
Oh, don't mind me.
I hope I'm...

446
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,599
New face is all.

447
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,234
Yeah.

448
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,803
Guess I'm running away
from myself, I guess.

449
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,906
Oh, yeah.

450
00:35:08,939 --> 00:35:14,378
I know that look.
Too well, I'm sorry to say.

451
00:35:14,411 --> 00:35:18,249
Running away from yourself.
That is a pickle.

452
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,851
[sighs] You take yourself
with you wherever you go.

453
00:35:20,884 --> 00:35:24,822
- Ain't that the bitch?
- [chuckles] Mm-hmm.

454
00:35:24,855 --> 00:35:26,323
[Mrs. Robertson]
Rent's 85 a week,

455
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:27,725
payable up front.

456
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:31,262
Billy paid your first two,
rest's on you.

457
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,899
No pets, no parties, no noise.

458
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,568
- I'm a quiet tenant.
- [scoffs]

459
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:41,705
Last guy said the same.
Math student.

460
00:35:41,738 --> 00:35:43,607
Even let him paint the wall
all blackboard,

461
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,644
so he could scribble
his little puzzles up there.

462
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,547
Wasn't quiet. No, sir.

463
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,816
Didn't even paint over this when he
left, but I'm glad he didn't,

464
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:55,419
'cause I can make this
easy for ya,

465
00:35:55,452 --> 00:35:57,421
so you see it every morning
when you wake.

466
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:02,693
You sure you wanna
vouch for this pup?

467
00:36:02,726 --> 00:36:04,228
Pretty sure.

468
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:05,496
It's your ass, Billy.

469
00:36:06,563 --> 00:36:08,533
Bleedin' heart, this one.

470
00:36:10,934 --> 00:36:14,471
I'm downstairs, ground floor,
if you need anything.

471
00:36:14,504 --> 00:36:17,241
Find me tomorrow,
talk about some work.

472
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:20,778
Why are you doing this?

473
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,346
You don't know me.

474
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:24,348
No, I don't.

475
00:36:24,381 --> 00:36:27,251
But I know the look,
like I said.

476
00:36:27,284 --> 00:36:30,688
And sometimes I get this
feeling about people.

477
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,624
- Hard to understand, I guess.
- Mm.

478
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:35,493
Easier than you think.

479
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:38,629
- Thanks.
- All right.

480
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:42,600
[door closes]

481
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,285
You ready?

482
00:37:03,787 --> 00:37:04,989
She's ready.

483
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,829
[Andi] Who...
Who are these people?

484
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:14,465
[Rose] You'll find out after.

485
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,367
That over there
is Grampa Flick...

486
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,436
and he'll lead us. Lie down.

487
00:37:18,935 --> 00:37:20,304
There.

488
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:28,445
No fear. You understand?

489
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:30,448
[breathing shakily]

490
00:37:36,753 --> 00:37:38,489
We are the True Knot

491
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,325
and we endure.

492
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:43,627
[all chant in other language]

We are the fortunate ones.

Would she join us?

Would she tie her life
to our life?

Yes.

Or six months?

Yeah.

[Dr. John] New to town, huh?

00:42:46,162 --> 00:42:48,265
[Dan] Yeah, I, uh...

563
00:42:48,298 --> 00:42:50,300
[Dr. John] Nothing personal.
I delivered half the people in the room.

- Just new faces pop, that's all.
- This here is Dan Torrance.

- He's fresh off the bus.
- Hey.

566
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,974
Fresh off the ground,
by the look.

567
00:42:57,774 --> 00:42:58,942
Oh.

568
00:42:58,975 --> 00:43:00,677
There's no judgment here,
brother.

569
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,112
I mean, we've all been there.

570
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:04,281
- And worse, trust me.
- Oh, yeah.

How is Frankie these days?

Well, he'll find his way back.

575
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,859
You know, he's got a good heart
under it all.

576
00:43:15,892 --> 00:43:19,696
Billy really tried with him.
Well, we all did.

577
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:22,332
Well, Billy, you know, if you're
looking for a wing to climb under...

- [pats Billy] -...I can't

Thank you for your hospitality.

I'm a little, uh...

All right?

[Billy] Train's still running.

591
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:50,193
[Dr. John] Yeah. Yeah.

- Hope to see you again soon.

Yeah. Hey, Billy, hang on.

598
00:44:01,204 --> 00:44:02,706
Hey, Doc.

599
00:44:04,741 --> 00:44:07,344
Your watch. Uh...

600
00:44:07,377 --> 00:44:10,447
You lost your watch.
You were worried about the kid with, uh...

601

Goocher's.

602
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:15,385
What?

603
00:44:15,418 --> 00:44:19,857
The kid with Goocher's or
Gaucher's. The bone thing.

604
00:44:22,325 --> 00:44:24,194
Gaucher's disease.

00:44:24,227 --> 00:44:25,929
[Dan] Right.

606
00:44:25,962 --> 00:44:27,264
You were washing your hands
in the hospital bathroom

607
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,767
and you left it
on the soap dispenser.

608
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,938
Well, just check
on the soap dispenser.

609
00:44:34,971 --> 00:44:36,874
- It's good to meet you.
- Yeah.

610
00:44:42,145 --> 00:44:43,380
[Dr. John] How did you know?

611
00:44:44,914 --> 00:44:46,984
I wish I could say. Uh...

612
00:44:48,284 --> 00:44:49,853

A lucky guess.

What do you wanna do here?

617
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:07,404
What do you mean?

618
00:45:07,437 --> 00:45:10,307
I mean here in Frazier.
Why are you here?

619
00:45:11,374 --> 00:45:12,843
And don't bullshit me, Dan.

620
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,946
I'm prone to
gut feelings of my own.

621
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:19,382
I don't know. I don't know.

622
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:22,820
Something different
than I've been doing.

623
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:26,190
Something better.

624
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,459
Anything's better, frankly.

626
00:45:32,028 --> 00:45:33,396
Does it matter?

627
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:35,432
Do you believe in something?
Something...

628
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:38,869
bigger than you?

629
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:44,141
Our... Our beliefs
don't make us better people.

630
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,510
Our actions
make us better people.

No.

Until I do, we...

827
01:00:55,784 --> 01:00:58,320
You gotta open a canister,
Rosie.

828
01:00:58,353 --> 01:01:02,324
We took steam six months ago,
Crow. Six months is nothing.

829
01:01:02,357 --> 01:01:06,429
That kid in Delaware wasn't so
steamy and it's already showing.

830
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:08,230
You see Grampa Flick's hair,
yeah?

831
01:01:08,263 --> 01:01:09,699
[Rose] Yeah.

832
01:01:09,732 --> 01:01:11,267
- I don't think he's well.
- [chuckles]

833
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,003
Grampa Flick hasn't been well
since Nixon was in office.

834
01:01:14,036 --> 01:01:16,272
I know.

835
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:19,208
But we need to eat.
All of us.

836
01:01:20,776 --> 01:01:22,712
Are the canisters low?

837
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:24,280
'Course not.

838
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:27,383
Just no need to waste one
if you're close to the kill.

839
01:01:29,184 --> 01:01:30,753
- Rosie.
- Mm-hmm?

840
01:01:30,786 --> 01:01:33,222
I might need it
just to find him.

841
01:01:37,025 --> 01:01:38,794
There used to be more steam
in the world, you know?

842
01:01:38,827 --> 01:01:40,329
Oh, don't be daft. Come on.

843
01:01:40,362 --> 01:01:42,064
That's like when rubes say,

844
01:01:42,097 --> 01:01:44,400
"50 years ago, people used
to be more neighborly."

845
01:01:44,433 --> 01:01:46,135
But it's true, Rosie.

846
01:01:46,168 --> 01:01:48,270
There's less steam out there,
and it's weaker, too.

847
01:01:48,303 --> 01:01:50,072
I don't know if
it's their cell phones or diets

848
01:01:50,105 --> 01:01:51,774
or their Netflix or what,

849
01:01:51,807 --> 01:01:53,876
but I am not picking up
many scents these days,

850
01:01:53,909 --> 01:01:55,411
and the ones that I do, Rosie,
are just not that...

851
01:01:55,444 --> 01:01:57,847
I'll open a canister tonight
to tide everyone over.

852
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,115
Thank you.

853
01:02:05,387 --> 01:02:07,857
- You know it, Rosie.
- I know what?

854
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,892
It's why you're up here
every day.

855
01:02:09,925 --> 01:02:11,828
It's why you're always up here no
matter what you tell the others.

856
01:02:12,928 --> 01:02:14,230
The world's not as steamy

857
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:16,365
and you are looking
for a whale.

That kid is a natural.

He hits the ball every time.

01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:52,681
Where?

958
01:10:52,714 --> 01:10:55,651
East Coast, I think.

959

from 1,500 miles away?

Maybe further.

961

962

Girl, I think.

963
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:13,435
She was out of there so fast.

964
01:11:13,468 --> 01:11:16,338
But I swear, Crow Daddy,

965
01:11:16,371 --> 01:11:19,875
I haven't felt power like that,

966

freak out,

971
01:11:32,053 --> 01:11:34,589
send her to a psychiatrist.

972
01:11:34,622 --> 01:11:37,759
You know, they get her on
pills, could ruin the steam.

973
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:38,894
Might muffle her just...

974
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:40,762
No, giving Paxil to this kid,

975
01:11:40,795 --> 01:11:44,433
it's like throwing a piece of
Saran Wrap over a searchlight.

01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:46,468
I don't know where she is,

977
01:11:46,501 --> 01:11:49,071
but when she comes back,
and she'll be back,

978
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:52,675
oh, I'll be ready, honey.

979
01:11:55,076 --> 01:11:56,745
I'll be ready.

980
01:12:57,705 --> 01:12:59,441

[Abra] Guess what.

983
01:13:03,478 --> 01:13:05,447
I made a new friend.

984
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,115
His name's Dan.

985
01:13:07,148 --> 01:13:09,084
Yeah? At school?

986
01:13:10,051 --> 01:13:12,154
No. He doesn't live here.

987
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:14,055
I mean, he lives close.

988
01:13:14,088 --> 01:13:15,524
Frazier, I think.

989
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:16,958
No big deal.

990
01:13:16,991 --> 01:13:19,094
Abs, are you okay?

991
01:13:19,127 --> 01:13:20,562
Last night, I...

01:13:20,595 --> 01:13:22,597
I'm okay.

993
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:24,132
Sorry about that.

994
01:13:24,165 --> 01:13:27,436
I know that head of yours
is like a radio sometimes.

995
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:31,473
And you pick up
some weird stations.

996
01:13:31,506 --> 01:13:32,541
Nothing weird like that.

997
01:13:33,608 --> 01:13:35,010
Not anymore.

998
01:13:39,647 --> 01:13:41,417
[music playing on headphones]

999
01:13:44,519 --> 01:13:45,987
[boy] My God.

1000
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:48,590
I've gotta study.
If I don't study...

1001
01:13:48,623 --> 01:13:52,127
[boy 2] Running play.
Hand-off to 11 and...

1002
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,163
Coach is gonna kill me
if I don't get these.

1003
01:13:55,663 --> 01:13:57,666
[girl] Why doesn't he like me?

1004
01:13:57,699 --> 01:13:59,601
My hair?
I should change my hair.

1005
01:13:59,634 --> 01:14:01,169
[girl 2] The freak
is staring at me again.

1006
01:14:01,202 --> 01:14:03,038
What is she staring at?

1007
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:04,006
Freak.

1008
01:14:43,845 --> 01:14:45,013
[David] Hey, Abba-doo.

1009
01:14:45,046 --> 01:14:46,214
Hey, Dad.

1010
01:14:46,247 --> 01:14:47,850
School okay?

1011
01:14:48,783 --> 01:14:50,185
How's the book?

1012
01:14:50,218 --> 01:14:52,153
Good. Yeah, going good.

1013
01:14:52,186 --> 01:14:54,222
I'm writing about
Charleston and Black Bottom.

1014
01:14:54,255 --> 01:14:56,124
Yeah, it's...

1015
01:14:56,157 --> 01:14:58,793
- It's feeling like...
- I'm going to start my homework.

1016
01:14:58,826 --> 01:15:02,564
Okay. Good.
That's good, sweetie.

1017
01:15:02,597 --> 01:15:04,699
Think Harvard in three years.

1018
01:15:04,732 --> 01:15:05,934
[Abra] We'll see.

1019
01:15:05,967 --> 01:15:07,769
Yeah. We will see.

1020
01:15:08,870 --> 01:15:10,873
[music playing on headphones]

1021
01:15:20,014 --> 01:15:21,250
[sighs]

1022
01:15:31,125 --> 01:15:32,227
[screams]

1023
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:33,662
[gasps]

1024
01:15:54,282 --> 01:15:55,317
[laughs]

1025
01:15:57,051 --> 01:15:59,187
[laughter echoes]

1026
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,011
[gasps]

1027
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:50,205
[gasps]

1028
01:17:05,186 --> 01:17:06,688
[inhales sharply]

1029
01:17:40,421 --> 01:17:42,257
[Muzak playing on speakers]

1030
01:18:08,282 --> 01:18:09,751
- [PA chimes]
- [woman on PA] Thanks so much

1031
01:18:09,784 --> 01:18:11,386
for shopping with us today.

1032
01:18:11,419 --> 01:18:14,089
And remember, we're always
fresh, just for you.

1033
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:45,754
Well, hi there.

1034
01:18:52,827 --> 01:18:54,196
[gasps] Get out!

1035
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:58,133
Get out! Get out of my head!

1036
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,001
[gasps]

1037
01:19:00,034 --> 01:19:01,136
Get out!

1038
01:19:06,407 --> 01:19:07,909
[gasping]

1039
01:19:10,578 --> 01:19:13,348
- Ma'am, are you okay?
- No! No.

1040
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:15,117
Yeah, I'm fine.

1041
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:17,819
I'm fine.

1042
01:19:17,852 --> 01:19:19,221
[panting]

1043
01:19:20,955 --> 01:19:22,224
[exhales]

1044
01:19:24,492 --> 01:19:26,194
Jesus.

1045
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:29,063
[Billy] Danno?

1046
01:19:29,096 --> 01:19:30,398
- Dan? Dan?
- [moans]

1047
01:19:30,431 --> 01:19:32,901
Get up. Stand up, Dan.

1048
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:34,136
Come on, Danno.

1049
01:19:35,837 --> 01:19:38,106
- What happened?
- Well, you just dropped.

1050
01:19:38,139 --> 01:19:40,876
Thought you was having a stroke.
Who's Tony?

1051
01:19:42,343 --> 01:19:43,912
What?

1052
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:45,013
You kept saying,
"Please help me, Tony."

1053
01:19:46,347 --> 01:19:48,449
Oh.

1054
01:19:48,482 --> 01:19:51,286
Well, I'm sorry about that.
[mutters]

1055
01:19:52,153 --> 01:19:53,321
[pants]

1056
01:20:10,471 --> 01:20:12,440
Rosie?

1057
01:20:21,148 --> 01:20:22,417
[Rose sighs]

1058
01:20:24,018 --> 01:20:25,186
We've got a problem.

1059
01:20:25,219 --> 01:20:27,422
- Talk to me.
- The looker?

1060
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:29,557
Yeah, she found me again.

1061
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:31,092
- How?
- I don't know.

1062
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:32,493
I don't care.

1063
01:20:32,526 --> 01:20:36,097
We have to have her, Crow.
We have to.

1064
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:38,266
Does she know who you are?
Where we are?

1065
01:20:38,299 --> 01:20:42,437
No, I don't know. I don't think...
That's not the important... Look.

1066
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:45,006
- I said she's huge steam, right?
- Mm-hmm.

1067
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:47,308
Yeah, it's even bigger
than that.

1068
01:20:47,341 --> 01:20:49,010
I tried to turn around in her

1069
01:20:49,043 --> 01:20:52,113
and she blew me out of her
like I was nothing.

1070
01:20:52,146 --> 01:20:55,016
- Bullshit.
- No. Never happened to me, ever.

1071
01:20:55,049 --> 01:20:56,852
I would have said
that was impossible.

1072
01:20:58,619 --> 01:21:00,622
Is she food
or do we turn her?

1073
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:03,291
We don't turn her.

1074
01:21:03,324 --> 01:21:04,893
Rosie, are you sure?

1075
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:06,394
If she's what you say she is,
then...

1076
01:21:06,427 --> 01:21:09,430
Then we don't want anyone
with that power in the Knot.

1077
01:21:09,463 --> 01:21:11,433
Jeez. Think about it.

1078
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:19,975
What if she's neither?

1079
01:21:20,641 --> 01:21:21,943
What do you mean?

1080
01:21:21,976 --> 01:21:24,445
I mean, we don't kill her.

1081
01:21:24,478 --> 01:21:26,248
And we don't turn her.

1082
01:21:27,615 --> 01:21:29,284
Think of a cow.

1083
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:32,020
You butcher one, that gives you
meat for a month.

1084
01:21:33,387 --> 01:21:35,190
Keep it alive,

1085
01:21:36,123 --> 01:21:38,326
take care of it,

1086
01:21:38,359 --> 01:21:41,195
it gives you milk for years.

1087
01:21:41,228 --> 01:21:43,298
- Rosie, we've never tried that.
- I know.

1088
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:45,300
Because a steam head is
dangerous.

1089
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:47,001
You keep it alive,
it could be dangerous.

1090
01:21:47,034 --> 01:21:49,570
I know. The point... [chuckles]

1091
01:21:49,603 --> 01:21:52,173
The point, Crow,

1092
01:21:52,206 --> 01:21:54,376
is she's the great white whale.

1093
01:21:55,376 --> 01:21:56,978
And I want her.

1094
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:00,248
I want her.

1095
01:22:01,649 --> 01:22:03,652
I fucking want her.

1096
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:16,097
[Lucy] Have a great day.

1097
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:17,299
You, too.

1098
01:22:28,676 --> 01:22:30,078
[school bell rings]

1099
01:23:20,461 --> 01:23:22,397
[train bell dinging]

1100
01:23:27,401 --> 01:23:29,571
[kids chattering excitedly]

1101
01:23:44,518 --> 01:23:46,221
[Abra] Hi.

1102
01:23:56,397 --> 01:23:57,665
[Dan] Billy.

1103
01:24:15,883 --> 01:24:17,652
[Abra] You can hear me.

1104
01:24:17,685 --> 01:24:20,221
Let's use our outside voices,
all right?

1105
01:24:21,455 --> 01:24:23,224
You tracked me down?

1106
01:24:23,257 --> 01:24:27,829
It was easier than I thought.
Like GPS, but in my head.

1107
01:24:27,862 --> 01:24:33,134
Look, I don't mean any offense,
but this day and age, a grown man

1108
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:35,103
sitting with a teenage girl
on a park bench...

1109
01:24:35,136 --> 01:24:37,805
I'm Abra Stone. And if anyone
asks, you're my uncle.

1110
01:24:37,838 --> 01:24:39,374
Uncle Dan.

1111
01:24:41,842 --> 01:24:45,313
And that's not even a lie.
Not totally.

1112
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:47,448
We're related in other ways.

1113
01:24:47,481 --> 01:24:49,317
You're magic, like me.

1114
01:24:50,851 --> 01:24:52,720
I don't know about magic.

1115
01:24:53,754 --> 01:24:55,323
I...

1116
01:24:55,356 --> 01:24:56,858
I always called it the shining.

1117
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:58,760
And, yeah, we both shine.

1118
01:24:59,827 --> 01:25:01,395
Do your parents know?

1119
01:25:01,428 --> 01:25:03,131
About my shine?

1120
01:25:04,598 --> 01:25:05,900
They're scared of it,

1121
01:25:05,933 --> 01:25:08,503
but they think it's gone
except for a few things.

1122
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:11,906
Like, my mom sometimes asks me to
help her find something she's lost.

1123
01:25:11,939 --> 01:25:13,808
Last month,
it was her car keys.

1124
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:16,644
She left them on my dad's
worktable in the garage.

1125
01:25:16,677 --> 01:25:19,413
But they don't talk about it.

1126
01:25:19,446 --> 01:25:22,583
Or if I use it,
they look at me different.

1127
01:25:22,616 --> 01:25:24,318
Or not at all.

1128
01:25:24,351 --> 01:25:26,787
Not for a whole day once.

1129
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:28,690
Wouldn't look me in the eyes.

1130
01:25:30,858 --> 01:25:33,161
So, I try not to use it.

1131
01:25:33,194 --> 01:25:35,296
Because if people find out,

1132
01:25:35,329 --> 01:25:36,764
"Eek, a freak." You know?

1133
01:25:38,699 --> 01:25:40,468
Sure you know.

1134
01:25:40,501 --> 01:25:42,437
You try not to use it, too.

1135
01:25:44,538 --> 01:25:47,542
You've been trying a long time,

1136
01:25:47,575 --> 01:25:50,812
and she couldn't look you
in your eyes either.

1137
01:25:54,949 --> 01:25:56,551
When I was a kid, I didn't

1138
01:25:56,584 --> 01:25:59,420
understand the shining.
I called it "Tony."

1139
01:25:59,453 --> 01:26:01,756
I thought he was
my imaginary friend.

1140
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:04,825
I thought you were
my imaginary friend...

1141
01:26:04,858 --> 01:26:06,928
for a long time.

1142
01:26:08,295 --> 01:26:11,732
How many of us are out there?

1143
01:26:11,765 --> 01:26:13,734
There's a lot of people
who have a little bit of shine,

1144
01:26:13,767 --> 01:26:15,369
they don't even know it.

1145
01:26:15,402 --> 01:26:16,704
They always seem to come home

1146
01:26:16,737 --> 01:26:18,539
with flowers
when their wives are sad,

1147
01:26:18,572 --> 01:26:20,841
or they do well on the school
test they didn't study for.

1148
01:26:20,874 --> 01:26:22,710
But I only met
two or three people

1149
01:26:22,743 --> 01:26:24,946
in my whole life
who knew they shined.

1150
01:26:27,548 --> 01:26:29,650
The baseball boy shined.

1151
01:26:29,683 --> 01:26:31,586
His name was Bradley Trevor.

1152
01:26:34,755 --> 01:26:36,891
These people...

1153
01:26:36,924 --> 01:26:39,727
they look like people anyway,
they took him.

1154
01:26:40,794 --> 01:26:42,797
And they ate him.

1155
01:26:43,931 --> 01:26:45,800
They ate his shine.

1156
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:49,270
You could feel it?

1157
01:26:49,303 --> 01:26:51,706
And they could feel me,
I think.

1158
01:26:51,739 --> 01:26:54,275
At least one of them did.
A lady.

1159
01:26:55,709 --> 01:26:57,378
The lady with the hat.

1160
01:26:58,712 --> 01:27:01,882
I wanna find them, stop them,

1161
01:27:01,915 --> 01:27:05,920
because I think they've done
this to a lot of other kids, too.

1162
01:27:05,953 --> 01:27:08,389
So, I have to do something,
right?

1163
01:27:09,356 --> 01:27:11,525
Why did you come here?

1164
01:27:11,558 --> 01:27:12,960
Why me?

1165
01:27:12,993 --> 01:27:14,695
Because you can hear me.

1166
01:27:14,728 --> 01:27:17,465
You'd believe me.
You shine, too.

1167
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:19,300
And they hurt people like us.

1168
01:27:21,535 --> 01:27:22,971
I mean, what would you do?

1169
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,642
If you could get
something of his,

1170
01:27:27,675 --> 01:27:28,976
if you could go to Iowa...

1171
01:27:29,009 --> 01:27:30,778
- Whoa, hang on.
- I can help you find him.

1172
01:27:30,811 --> 01:27:32,613
Then his parents would know
where he was.

1173
01:27:32,646 --> 01:27:34,615
They could bury him right,
at least.

1174
01:27:34,648 --> 01:27:36,751
We could also get his glove.

1175
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:38,519
If I can touch that glove,
I can track them.

1176
01:27:38,552 --> 01:27:39,954
Easy. Easy.

1177
01:27:39,987 --> 01:27:42,623
Because Barry the Chunk,
I think that was his name,

1178
01:27:42,656 --> 01:27:44,792
for a while,
before they killed him,

1179
01:27:44,825 --> 01:27:46,594
he was wearing it.

1180
01:27:58,038 --> 01:28:00,841
Abra, go home.

1181
01:28:00,874 --> 01:28:03,778
Think about your school.
Think about your parents.

1182
01:28:03,811 --> 01:28:05,780
Think about
the rest of your life.

1183
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:07,882
Don't chase these people.

1184
01:28:07,915 --> 01:28:09,817
Don't aggravate them.

1185
01:28:09,850 --> 01:28:12,887
And whatever you do,
don't attract their attention.

1186
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,722
Don't shine.

1187
01:28:14,755 --> 01:28:16,457
Find something, anything...

1188
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:20,394
Well, almost anything,
to stop that shine of yours.

1189
01:28:20,427 --> 01:28:23,064
Keep your head down, keep your
shine down and hope to God

1190
01:28:23,097 --> 01:28:25,733
that these people
or anything like them,

1191
01:28:25,766 --> 01:28:28,669
that they don't see you.

1192
01:28:28,702 --> 01:28:31,372
If they see you,
they come back.

1193
01:28:31,405 --> 01:28:32,907
Abra, do you hear me?

1194
01:28:34,007 --> 01:28:35,710
They come back.

1195
01:28:38,545 --> 01:28:40,615
Keep your head down. Stay safe.

1196
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:43,985
I'm sorry.

[Bugs Bunny on TV]
Things were tough that year.

1199
01:28:58,732 --> 01:29:00,535
A lot of actors
were out of work.

[Al Jolson] Hey, fellas.

What is it?

1203
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:08,609
Oh, it's nothing, Doc.

1204
01:29:09,443 --> 01:29:11,112
It's nothing.

1205
01:29:11,145 --> 01:29:12,814
Thinking about Dad.

1206
01:29:16,083 --> 01:29:17,385
No, I'm not.

1207
01:29:18,652 --> 01:29:20,655
You are. And you don't want to.

1208
01:29:25,759 --> 01:29:27,595
Don't worry about me, Doc.

1209
01:29:28,095 --> 01:29:29,030
I'm fine.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

I... I... I thought it was...

Thought I was
from the Overlook.

1222

Almost locked me up.

No, not for years.

Shit-eating grin on his face
till I pulled out a box for him.

1228
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:16,070
- That grin went fast.
- [chuckles]

1229
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:18,839
Hey, it never occurred to me
to ask you back then.

1230
01:31:18,872 --> 01:31:20,674
What happens to them
in those boxes?

1231
01:31:20,707 --> 01:31:22,042
Do they die in there?

1232
01:31:22,075 --> 01:31:23,478
Do you care?

1233
01:31:27,714 --> 01:31:28,916
I missed you.

1234
01:31:28,949 --> 01:31:30,117
Has it been a long time?

1235
01:31:31,685 --> 01:31:33,921
Can't tell.

1236
01:31:33,954 --> 01:31:37,925
This world is a dream
of a dream to me now.

1237
01:31:37,958 --> 01:31:40,661
Eight years. Little more.

1238
01:31:40,694 --> 01:31:42,730
Last time I saw you,

1239
01:31:42,763 --> 01:31:44,632
you was at the bottom.

1240
01:31:45,866 --> 01:31:47,768
You look better now.

1241
01:31:47,801 --> 01:31:49,937
Why are you here?

1242
01:31:49,970 --> 01:31:52,640
I'm here because
it all comes 'round.

1243
01:31:53,607 --> 01:31:55,243
Ka's a wheel, Doc.

1244
01:31:57,578 --> 01:31:58,946
You listen, son.

1245
01:31:58,979 --> 01:32:02,049
It hurts to be here,
so I'll only say it once.

1246
01:32:02,082 --> 01:32:05,553
These empty devils
ever found you

1247
01:32:05,586 --> 01:32:07,187
when you was a tyke,

1248
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:09,690
if they'd even sniffed you,

1249
01:32:09,723 --> 01:32:11,659
you'd be long dead.

1250
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:16,630
They're on the land
like a cancer on the skin.

1251
01:32:16,663 --> 01:32:19,199
Once, they rode camels
in the desert.

1252
01:32:19,232 --> 01:32:22,837
Once, they drove caravans
across Eastern Europe.

1253
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:26,006
They eat screams,

1254
01:32:26,039 --> 01:32:28,642
and drink pain,

1255
01:32:28,675 --> 01:32:31,312
and they've noticed
that little girl.

1256
01:32:32,646 --> 01:32:33,981
They might kill her,

1257
01:32:35,682 --> 01:32:36,918
might turn her,

1258
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:41,689
or might keep her
till she's all used up,

1259
01:32:41,722 --> 01:32:43,123
and that'd be worst of all.

1260
01:32:43,156 --> 01:32:44,992
You can't let 'em.

1261
01:32:47,661 --> 01:32:49,330
Why me?

1262
01:32:49,363 --> 01:32:51,765
Because she found you.

1263
01:32:51,798 --> 01:32:55,302
Because she showed up.
Hell, Doc, why me?

1264
01:32:55,335 --> 01:32:57,838
You just walked on
into my kitchen one day,

1265
01:32:57,871 --> 01:32:59,206
and I'm still on the hook.
[chuckles]

1266
01:32:59,239 --> 01:33:01,075
What the hell
am I supposed to do?

1267
01:33:03,310 --> 01:33:05,780
Get her what she asked for.

1268
01:33:08,015 --> 01:33:10,117
You won't see me again, Doc.

1269
01:33:11,118 --> 01:33:13,087
This is my last dream.

1270
01:33:19,326 --> 01:33:23,163
It seems to me
you grew up fine, son,

1271
01:33:23,196 --> 01:33:24,966
but you still owe a debt.

1272
01:33:30,070 --> 01:33:31,272
Pay it.

1276
01:33:50,157 --> 01:33:52,026
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

1277
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:54,895
I told you, "no distractions."
Didn't I?

1278
01:33:54,928 --> 01:33:56,864
Nothing to eat,
nothing to drink.

1279

Just peace, quiet,
and meditation.

1280

I need all my wits
for her tonight, Crow.

1281
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:06,340
That's why I'm here.
I found something.

can an earthquake be?"

of Richland Court,

1284
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:24,725
a short Anniston street that dead-ends
at the Saco River, are to be believed.

1285
01:34:24,758 --> 01:34:26,193
Late Tuesday night,

1286
01:34:26,226 --> 01:34:28,162
several residents of the street
reported a tremor

1287
01:34:28,195 --> 01:34:30,064
that rattled windows,
shook floors,

1288
01:34:30,097 --> 01:34:33,834
and sent glassware tumbling
from the shelves.

1289
01:34:33,867 --> 01:34:37,838
Although the Geological Survey
Center in Wrentham

1290
01:34:37,871 --> 01:34:40,941
"reports there were no temblors
in New England last Tuesday."

1291
01:34:42,008 --> 01:34:43,243
What do you think?

1292
01:34:43,276 --> 01:34:45,245
I think, maybe.

1293
01:34:45,278 --> 01:34:49,450
I'm not a hundred percent,
but I'll take fifty-fifty.

1294
01:34:49,483 --> 01:34:50,784
If that's actually her...

1295
01:34:50,817 --> 01:34:52,319
Richland Court.

1296
01:34:52,352 --> 01:34:54,388
She did that, shook a whole
street in New Hampshire...

1297
01:34:54,421 --> 01:34:57,191
Having a place to actually focus
on, not just a town, but a street,

1298
01:34:57,224 --> 01:35:00,227
is gonna make things a hell of
a lot easier for me tonight.

1299
01:35:01,194 --> 01:35:02,396

Well, she'll be asleep.

1304
01:35:15,442 --> 01:35:19,379
I'll just wanna look around,
see if she is.

1305
01:35:19,412 --> 01:35:22,817
Plant some suggestions,
like little worms.

1306
01:35:23,917 --> 01:35:26,453
Let them burrow.

1307
01:35:26,486 --> 01:35:30,191
A hundred worms about
her dear friends, the Knot.

1308
01:35:31,525 --> 01:35:33,961
And when we roll up,

1309
01:35:33,994 --> 01:35:37,998
she'll be so happy to see us,
she'll just hop right in the van.

1310
01:35:42,269 --> 01:35:44,505
- If she did this...
- Mm-hmm?

...really shook a whole street,

1312
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,510
I think you should be careful.

1313
01:35:49,543 --> 01:35:51,245
She's a little girl.

1314
01:35:53,513 --> 01:35:55,182
[both chuckle]

1315
01:35:56,950 --> 01:35:59,319
And you are the queen bitch
of all time.

1316
01:35:59,352 --> 01:36:01,221
- Mm.
- I know.

1317
01:36:01,254 --> 01:36:03,457
Just saying.

1318
01:36:03,490 --> 01:36:05,826
- Be careful.
- Mm.

1319

Mm.

- [music playing on headphones]
- [knock on door]

1323
01:36:30,317 --> 01:36:31,251
Hey.

1324
01:36:31,284 --> 01:36:32,252
Hey, Mom.

1325
01:36:32,285 --> 01:36:33,487
You feeling okay?

1326
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,022
We missed you at dinner.

1327
01:36:35,956 --> 01:36:38,559
I'm okay. Just had a rough day.

1328
01:36:43,363 --> 01:36:46,133
I'm flying out to see Momo
in the morning.

1329
01:36:46,166 --> 01:36:47,568
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1330
01:36:50,003 --> 01:36:51,238
Abs, is she...

1331
01:36:55,275 --> 01:36:56,911
Is she gonna
pull through this time?

1332
01:37:01,448 --> 01:37:02,449
I don't know.

1333
01:37:04,117 --> 01:37:05,219
I hope so.

1334
01:37:06,353 --> 01:37:07,822
Tell her I love her.

1335
01:37:11,558 --> 01:37:13,160
[crickets chirping]

1336

[continues breathing deeply]

1339
01:39:51,051 --> 01:39:53,253
Keep sleeping, princess.

1340
01:40:07,067 --> 01:40:10,170
You rubes. [scoffs]

1341
01:40:10,203 --> 01:40:13,573
Spend your whole lives
making little boxes,

1342
01:40:13,606 --> 01:40:16,410
little memories.

1343
01:40:16,443 --> 01:40:19,513
Oh, you think
they make you so rich.

1344
01:40:19,546 --> 01:40:21,582
You should see mine, kiddo.

1345
01:40:22,782 --> 01:40:26,020
Oh, my mind's a cathedral.

1346
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:32,559
Well, hi there.

1347
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:41,268
Hmm.

1348
01:40:53,246 --> 01:40:54,314
[groaning]

1349
01:40:56,716 --> 01:40:58,052
He said you'd come back.

1350
01:40:59,819 --> 01:41:00,821
And you did.

1351
01:41:00,854 --> 01:41:02,823
[continues groaning]

1352
01:41:02,856 --> 01:41:04,291
Good.

1353
01:41:04,324 --> 01:41:06,560
[Rose panting] No!

1354
01:41:06,593 --> 01:41:09,863
Get back! Get back!

1355
01:41:09,896 --> 01:41:12,666
[grunts] You're just
a fucking child!

Where are you?

1359
01:41:19,572 --> 01:41:21,808
Where? Where did you...?
Where...?

1360
01:41:21,841 --> 01:41:23,777
What did you...?
Where did you...?

1361
01:41:25,512 --> 01:41:26,480
No.

1362
01:41:28,648 --> 01:41:30,450
Get out! Get out!

1363
01:41:30,483 --> 01:41:31,651
Get out!

[groaning]

1370
01:42:17,397 --> 01:42:18,465
Rose?

1371
01:42:18,498 --> 01:42:19,866
Trap.

1372
01:42:19,899 --> 01:42:21,535
Trap.

1373
01:42:21,568 --> 01:42:23,470
- [Rose groans]
- [Andi] What the hell happened?

1374
01:42:23,503 --> 01:42:25,805
- Little bitch set a trap for me.
- Oh, my God. Your hand.

1375
01:42:25,838 --> 01:42:27,641
- [Crow] Rose! Rose, calm down.
- [grunts]

1376
01:42:27,674 --> 01:42:29,876
We know where she is now, right?
Now we know.

1377
01:42:29,909 --> 01:42:31,411
She was in my head!

1378
01:42:31,444 --> 01:42:32,846
- What?
- [Rose] Stealing!

1379
01:42:32,879 --> 01:42:33,947
What does she know?

1380
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:35,549
I don't know. I don't know.

1381
01:42:35,582 --> 01:42:37,851
- How much does she...
- [Rose] I don't know!

1382
01:42:37,884 --> 01:42:40,420
- [groans] I don't know...
- There's a problem.

1383
01:42:40,453 --> 01:42:41,421
Not now!

1384
01:42:41,454 --> 01:42:42,523
Grampa Flick...

1385
01:42:43,556 --> 01:42:45,325
I think he's cycling.

1386
01:42:46,226 --> 01:42:47,694
[whimpers]

1387
01:42:50,730 --> 01:42:53,600
[Abra] Uncle Dan! Uncle Dan,
I hurt her.

1388
01:42:53,633 --> 01:42:54,634
I really hurt her.

1389
01:42:54,667 --> 01:42:56,403
I hurt her and she deserved it

1390
01:42:56,436 --> 01:42:58,505
and that's not the best part.
The best part is...

1391
01:42:58,538 --> 01:43:01,608
The best part is I got in her head.
I got in her head.

1392
01:43:01,641 --> 01:43:03,743
- Uncle Dan? Are you there?
- Oh, God, Abra.

1393
01:43:03,776 --> 01:43:04,945
[Abra] Can you hear me?

1394
01:43:04,978 --> 01:43:06,380
What have you done?

1395
01:43:07,513 --> 01:43:08,682
[sighs]

1396
01:43:22,462 --> 01:43:24,998
Just talk to the kid.

1397
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:27,534
If we're gonna do this,
then let's do this.

1398
01:43:30,837 --> 01:43:31,939
Hi, Abra.

1399
01:43:35,908 --> 01:43:37,411
I can hear you.

1400
01:43:39,045 --> 01:43:40,480
[wheezing]

1401
01:43:41,681 --> 01:43:43,650
I don't understand.

1402
01:43:43,683 --> 01:43:44,785
[Rose] You will.

1403
01:43:46,653 --> 01:43:49,623
I thought we lived forever.

1404
01:43:49,656 --> 01:43:52,359
Did someone promise you that,
Andi?

1405
01:43:52,392 --> 01:43:54,695
Did someone say
you're immortal?

1406
01:43:55,862 --> 01:44:00,800
I said, "Live long, eat well."

1407
01:44:00,833 --> 01:44:02,802
We can live long, very long.

1408
01:44:02,835 --> 01:44:03,937
And we do,

1409
01:44:03,970 --> 01:44:05,739
most of us.

1410
01:44:05,772 --> 01:44:07,741
But we haven't been
eating well.

1411
01:44:08,975 --> 01:44:11,245
Not for a long time.

1412
01:44:12,078 --> 01:44:13,380
Rosie, he's going.

1413
01:44:15,014 --> 01:44:16,316
[weakly] Rosie.

1414
01:44:22,088 --> 01:44:23,557
Yes, love?

1415
01:44:24,824 --> 01:44:26,593
I'm scared.

1416
01:44:26,626 --> 01:44:29,663
No, you're not. [sniffs]

1417
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:34,768
You watched empires rise and
fall. [sniffling]

1418
01:44:34,801 --> 01:44:37,570
Cheered the gladiators in Rome.

1419
01:44:37,603 --> 01:44:39,606
Sailed across oceans,

1420
01:44:39,639 --> 01:44:41,841
to new worlds,

1421
01:44:41,874 --> 01:44:47,981
while you fed on kings,
and princes, and popes.

1422
01:44:48,014 --> 01:44:50,684
They wrote myths of you,

1423
01:44:50,717 --> 01:44:53,019
and made statues,

1424
01:44:53,052 --> 01:44:57,857
and they trembled
in their villages, and beds,

1425
01:44:57,890 --> 01:45:00,060
and skyscrapers.

1426
01:45:01,661 --> 01:45:04,064
- So, no...
- [gasps]

1427
01:45:04,097 --> 01:45:06,733
...you're not scared.

1428
01:45:08,634 --> 01:45:10,037
You're a king...

1429
01:45:11,537 --> 01:45:13,740
and you eat fear.

1430
01:45:17,510 --> 01:45:19,046
[labored breathing]

1431
01:45:22,682 --> 01:45:24,918
[gasping violently]

1432
01:45:24,951 --> 01:45:26,920

[all inhaling]

1436
01:46:00,686 --> 01:46:01,988
[knocks]

1437
01:46:05,625 --> 01:46:06,993
Hey, bro.

1438
01:46:07,026 --> 01:46:08,161
You know, it's 4:00 a.m.

1439
01:46:08,194 --> 01:46:10,397
You've always seen me, Billy.

1440
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:12,999
You have a good sense about
people, is that fair to say?

1441
01:46:13,833 --> 01:46:15,135
Yeah, what...

1442
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:17,404
You think I'm an honest man?
A good man?

1443
01:46:17,437 --> 01:46:18,705
I do, I do. Dan, I...

1444
01:46:18,738 --> 01:46:20,507
I need your help.

1445
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:22,075
The first thing I need is for
you to listen to a story

1446
01:46:22,108 --> 01:46:24,811
and try harder than you've ever
tried to believe me.

1447
01:46:41,861 --> 01:46:42,996
[Abra] How's it going?

1448
01:46:44,197 --> 01:46:45,665
Oh, hey.

1449
01:46:45,698 --> 01:46:46,933
Shouldn't you be
getting ready for school?

1450
01:46:46,966 --> 01:46:49,769
Yeah, but I wanted
to tag along.

1451
01:46:49,802 --> 01:46:51,037
How long have you been driving?

1452
01:46:51,070 --> 01:46:52,806
A few hours or so.

1453
01:46:52,839 --> 01:46:54,574
We should get there tonight.
Late.

1454
01:46:57,009 --> 01:46:58,745
Who's that?

1455
01:46:58,778 --> 01:47:00,113
He's my friend.

1456
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:02,716
Maybe my best friend.

1457
01:47:04,083 --> 01:47:06,052
You should've seen her face.

1458
01:47:06,085 --> 01:47:08,121
She was scared, Uncle Dan.

1459
01:47:08,154 --> 01:47:10,023
Scared like all those kids
were scared.

1460
01:47:10,056 --> 01:47:11,825
All those kids she's killed.

1461
01:47:11,858 --> 01:47:14,928
She was so mad
and so scared that I got in.

1462
01:47:14,961 --> 01:47:16,529
That was a new trick.

1463
01:47:16,562 --> 01:47:18,064
I've never done that before.

1464
01:47:18,097 --> 01:47:20,033
Yeah, me neither.
What was it like?

1465
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:22,469
Like a library.

1466
01:47:22,502 --> 01:47:24,738
I guess
we're all libraries inside.

1467
01:47:25,671 --> 01:47:27,106
How'd you do it?

1468
01:47:27,139 --> 01:47:29,509
Like this. Just a little push.

1469
01:47:29,542 --> 01:47:30,177
[tires screech]

1470
01:47:34,714 --> 01:47:36,149
Abra!

1471
01:47:36,182 --> 01:47:38,018
- Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry!
- [Billy grunts]

1472
01:47:42,955 --> 01:47:44,624
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
- It's okay.

1473
01:47:46,092 --> 01:47:48,027
What were all those boxes?

1474
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:49,162
Nothing.

1475
01:47:49,195 --> 01:47:50,564
Liar.

1476
01:47:53,666 --> 01:47:55,935
When I was a kid,

1477
01:47:55,968 --> 01:47:59,038
younger than you,
I bumped into something like these things

1478
01:47:59,071 --> 01:48:01,908
that ate like they do.

1479
01:48:01,941 --> 01:48:04,144
Only it wasn't a person,
it was a place.

1480
01:48:05,778 --> 01:48:10,583
They closed it down after
and let it rot.

1481
01:48:10,616 --> 01:48:12,819
But the things
that lived there, they...

1482
01:48:14,887 --> 01:48:16,923
Don't go poking around in there
again.

1483
01:48:16,956 --> 01:48:19,626
Okay, I won't. I promise.

1484
01:48:25,197 --> 01:48:27,000
[exhales heavily]

1485
01:48:32,939 --> 01:48:35,208
We're almost ready.
We're just loading up.

1486
01:48:35,241 --> 01:48:36,676
Good.

1487
01:48:36,709 --> 01:48:37,977
Get the caravan on the road

1488
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:39,579
and we'll have her
in a day or two.

1489
01:48:39,612 --> 01:48:42,048
I don't think
you should come, Rosie.

1490
01:48:42,081 --> 01:48:45,018
[scoffs] The fuck
did you just say?

1491
01:48:45,051 --> 01:48:46,219
She tagged you.

1492
01:48:46,252 --> 01:48:47,720
She got in your head.

1493
01:48:47,753 --> 01:48:49,622
Yeah, it won't happen again.

1494
01:48:49,655 --> 01:48:51,558
And who knows how much she got
to before you kicked her out.

1495
01:48:51,591 --> 01:48:52,892
She's mine, Crow.

1496
01:48:52,925 --> 01:48:54,227
Right now, as far as we know,

1497
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:56,763
you are the only one of us
she could track.

1498
01:48:56,796 --> 01:48:58,798
Now, if she sees you coming,

1499
01:48:58,831 --> 01:49:00,099
she could run

1500
01:49:00,132 --> 01:49:02,068
or set another trap.

1501
01:49:03,669 --> 01:49:06,005
I will knock her out cold.

1502
01:49:06,038 --> 01:49:09,108
One of our assets from the NSA
gave me the good stuff.

1503
01:49:09,141 --> 01:49:12,312
Put her out without
chance of an overdose.

1504
01:49:12,345 --> 01:49:15,114
I'll head south.
I'll circle around.

1505
01:49:15,147 --> 01:49:17,050
I'll come at her
from a different direction.

1506
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:18,284
I should be there.

1507
01:49:18,317 --> 01:49:20,253
You know I'm right about this.

1508
01:49:24,724 --> 01:49:25,892
Okay.

1509
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:29,829
I'll leave Andi here with you,
if you want.

1510
01:49:29,862 --> 01:49:32,599
No, no, you'll need your
strength, all of you.

1511
01:49:32,632 --> 01:49:34,601
If she pulls a trick on you,

1512
01:49:34,634 --> 01:49:36,669
stay together.

1513
01:49:36,702 --> 01:49:37,637
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1514
01:49:37,670 --> 01:49:39,005
[Rose] Mm-hmm.

1515
01:49:39,038 --> 01:49:41,107
But I got some tricks
of my own.

1516
01:49:47,046 --> 01:49:48,848
[Billy] Hey,
I think we're here.

1517
01:49:51,283 --> 01:49:52,252
[Dan] Okay.

1518
01:49:53,953 --> 01:49:55,589
I'll see if I can get her.

1519
01:49:56,822 --> 01:49:57,724
Abra?

1520
01:49:59,692 --> 01:50:02,395
[Abra] That's the sign.
Pull around back.

1521
01:50:02,428 --> 01:50:03,997
She says to pull around back.

1522
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:05,131
And I'll tell you when to stop.

1523
01:50:05,164 --> 01:50:06,933
She'll tell us when to stop.

1524
01:50:13,272 --> 01:50:15,274
[Billy] I gotta tell you,
Danno,

1525
01:50:15,307 --> 01:50:17,944
I don't know whether I hope
you're right or wrong about this.

1526
01:50:17,977 --> 01:50:21,648
I mean, if you're wrong,
my friend is crazy.

1527
01:50:21,681 --> 01:50:25,418
I mean, full-blown,
mental breakdown,

1528
01:50:25,451 --> 01:50:29,188
imaginary-monsters-
killing-imaginary-kids

1529
01:50:29,221 --> 01:50:30,923
bonkers.

1530
01:50:30,956 --> 01:50:33,326
But, you know, I...
I can work with that.

1531
01:50:34,694 --> 01:50:35,962
If you're right, though...

1532
01:50:35,995 --> 01:50:37,697
[Dan] I know.

1533
01:50:37,730 --> 01:50:39,132
It's much worse.

1534
01:50:53,312 --> 01:50:54,881
You should go home.

1535
01:50:54,914 --> 01:50:56,716
What?

1536
01:50:56,749 --> 01:50:58,051
No, not you.

1537
01:50:59,118 --> 01:51:00,353
I can handle it.

1538
01:51:00,386 --> 01:51:03,056
No. We'll take it from here.

1539
01:51:06,125 --> 01:51:07,961
Okay, it's just us.

1540
01:51:24,944 --> 01:51:26,179
You smell that?

1541
01:51:29,148 --> 01:51:31,451
Used to hunt.
I ever tell you that?

1542
01:51:31,484 --> 01:51:32,885
[Dan] No.

1543
01:51:32,918 --> 01:51:33,753
Deer.

1544
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:35,889
This one summer,

1545
01:51:37,022 --> 01:51:38,925
I clipped this buck.

1546
01:51:38,958 --> 01:51:41,294
I was tracking it for two days.

1547
01:51:41,327 --> 01:51:44,731
I got the shot, clipped him.

1548
01:51:44,764 --> 01:51:46,999
He ran off, I went after.

1549
01:51:47,032 --> 01:51:50,403
Figured he wasn't
gonna last long.

1550
01:51:50,436 --> 01:51:52,238
[panting]

1551
01:51:52,271 --> 01:51:53,906
Then he vanished.

1552
01:51:53,939 --> 01:51:56,976
Just up and evaporated.

1553
01:51:57,009 --> 01:51:59,446
Not a trace. Truly baffling.

1554
01:52:02,414 --> 01:52:03,916
Five days later,

1555
01:52:03,949 --> 01:52:06,886
I'm trying a different spot,
miles away.

1556
01:52:06,919 --> 01:52:10,023
I come around looking
for a spot for a blind...

1557
01:52:11,957 --> 01:52:13,226
then I smelled him.

1558
01:52:14,827 --> 01:52:16,129
Smelled him.

1559
01:52:17,229 --> 01:52:19,098
Found that buck

1560
01:52:19,131 --> 01:52:21,367
holed up to a hollow trunk,

1561
01:52:22,201 --> 01:52:23,903
dead for days.

1562
01:52:25,237 --> 01:52:26,806
The smell...

1563
01:52:28,073 --> 01:52:29,943
Never hunted a day since.

1564
01:52:33,412 --> 01:52:35,381
This is the same smell.

1565
01:52:40,519 --> 01:52:41,788
[Dan grunts]

1566
01:52:51,297 --> 01:52:52,799
Billy.

1567
01:53:07,179 --> 01:53:09,482
[both grunting]

1568
01:53:12,284 --> 01:53:13,486
Oh, my God!

1569
01:53:17,022 --> 01:53:18,424
[gagging]

1570
01:53:22,428 --> 01:53:24,330
[both exclaim]

1571
01:53:25,965 --> 01:53:27,400
[retching]

1572
01:53:31,503 --> 01:53:32,806
[gagging]

1573
01:53:34,540 --> 01:53:36,409
[Billy continues retching]

1574
01:53:38,244 --> 01:53:39,345
[coughing]

1575
01:53:40,246 --> 01:53:41,581
[groaning]

1576
01:53:46,518 --> 01:53:47,553
[Billy] Fuck.

1577
01:53:47,586 --> 01:53:50,122
Fuck, Danno. What the fuck?

1578
01:53:50,155 --> 01:53:52,892
They didn't even bury him deep.
They buried him shallow.

1579
01:53:52,925 --> 01:53:53,927
I'm sorry, Billy.

1580
01:53:55,561 --> 01:53:57,230
[Billy] What did you
get us into?

1581
01:54:05,638 --> 01:54:07,206
[Billy] The people
who did that...

1582
01:54:07,239 --> 01:54:08,374
[Dan] They're not people.

1583
01:54:09,642 --> 01:54:12,478
No. No, they ain't.

1584
01:54:12,511 --> 01:54:14,247
Anyone do that to a little boy,

1585
01:54:15,581 --> 01:54:17,917
they ain't people.

1586
01:54:17,950 --> 01:54:19,151
[Abra] Did you get it?

1587
01:54:19,184 --> 01:54:20,286
Yeah, we got it.

1588
01:54:20,319 --> 01:54:22,154
Is she back?

1589
01:54:22,187 --> 01:54:24,090
We're heading back to you.
We'll be back in the morning.

1590
01:54:24,123 --> 01:54:25,225
We got a stop to make.

1591
01:54:27,626 --> 01:54:30,096
I need you to show your parents
what's happening.

1592
01:54:30,596 --> 01:54:32,298
No.

1593
01:54:32,331 --> 01:54:34,634
- Yeah.
- No. They almost think I'm normal.

1594
01:54:34,667 --> 01:54:36,269
If I tell them, they'll...

1595
01:54:36,302 --> 01:54:37,970
[Dan] Rose'll go through them
to get to you.

1596
01:54:38,003 --> 01:54:39,405
You know that, don't you?

1597
01:54:39,438 --> 01:54:41,240
She'll cut them down
without a second thought.

1598
01:54:41,273 --> 01:54:43,076
And she's coming, Abra.

1599
01:54:43,575 --> 01:54:45,445
They need to know.

1600
01:54:47,079 --> 01:54:48,381
[Abra sighs]

1601
01:54:50,182 --> 01:54:52,418
So, what's this stop
we gotta make?

1602
01:54:52,451 --> 01:54:54,587
You still got
those old deer rifles?

1603
01:55:12,204 --> 01:55:14,006
You're Uncle Dan?

1604
01:55:14,039 --> 01:55:15,374
- The fuck you think you are?
- Sir...

1605
01:55:15,407 --> 01:55:17,376
Hmm? Hmm? She is 13 years old!

1606
01:55:17,409 --> 01:55:18,711
Abra, I told you to show him.

1607
01:55:18,744 --> 01:55:20,513
- I told him.
- Well, that's not the same.

1608
01:55:20,546 --> 01:55:21,948
I'm gonna kick your ass
before I call the police, huh?

1609
01:55:21,981 --> 01:55:23,115
- Hey, hey, hey!
- No, no, no. Abra.

1610
01:55:23,148 --> 01:55:24,283
Now, don't you say her name.

1611
01:55:24,316 --> 01:55:25,351
Abra...

1612
01:55:26,418 --> 01:55:28,955
[David screaming]

1613
01:55:33,158 --> 01:55:34,360
[screaming stops]

1614
01:55:40,232 --> 01:55:43,502
[Dan] I'm sorry, Mr. Stone.
I am a friend.

1615
01:55:43,535 --> 01:55:46,005
Everything she told you
is true.

1616
01:55:47,539 --> 01:55:48,741
[bottle rattles]

1617
01:55:48,774 --> 01:55:50,509
What the hell is happening?

1618
01:55:50,542 --> 01:55:52,311
I'm sorry.

1619
01:55:52,344 --> 01:55:54,680
Abra needs to
show you something.

1620
01:55:54,713 --> 01:55:56,115
[Billy] I saw the boy.

1621
01:55:56,148 --> 01:55:57,150
I saw his body.

1622
01:55:57,783 --> 01:55:59,318
It's all true.

1623
01:55:59,351 --> 01:56:00,687
Probably, your friend here
put him there.

1624
01:56:02,054 --> 01:56:03,723
You think about that?

1625
01:56:03,756 --> 01:56:05,191
Not for long, I didn't.

1626
01:56:05,224 --> 01:56:07,526
Mr. Stone,
your daughter is special.

1627
01:56:07,559 --> 01:56:08,761
Don't talk about her.

1628
01:56:08,794 --> 01:56:11,097
I think you know that.
Deep down.

1629
01:56:12,664 --> 01:56:15,401
She knows what happened
to that little boy,

1630
01:56:15,434 --> 01:56:17,236
and she knows who did it.

1631
01:56:18,237 --> 01:56:19,305
Show him.

1632
01:56:23,675 --> 01:56:25,177
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1633
01:56:25,210 --> 01:56:27,446
I really didn't want to.

1634
01:56:27,479 --> 01:56:28,581
Didn't want to what?

1635
01:56:28,614 --> 01:56:30,116

[breath quivering]

1637
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:48,234
No, thanks.

1638
01:56:48,267 --> 01:56:49,602
No.

1639
01:56:49,635 --> 01:56:50,770
[bottle rattles]

1640
01:56:58,544 --> 01:56:59,779
Those people...

1641
01:57:01,580 --> 01:57:03,449
they know about my daughter?

1642
01:57:03,482 --> 01:57:05,184
They do.

1643
01:57:05,217 --> 01:57:07,653
And sooner or later,
they're coming.

1644
01:57:07,686 --> 01:57:09,288
We gotta do something.

1645
01:57:09,321 --> 01:57:11,357
All right, we're calling
the police, the FBI...

1646
01:57:11,390 --> 01:57:14,093
[Dan] These people have been
around a long, long time, sir.

1647
01:57:14,126 --> 01:57:15,628
They're rich, connected.

1648
01:57:15,661 --> 01:57:18,197
I don't think they're worried
about the police.

1649
01:57:18,230 --> 01:57:19,665
But where are they?

1650
01:57:19,698 --> 01:57:22,134
When are they coming?
Where can we go?

1651
01:57:22,167 --> 01:57:24,170
Abra can answer that...

1652
01:57:24,203 --> 01:57:25,505
if she's ready.

1653
01:57:26,672 --> 01:57:27,740
I'm ready.

1654
01:57:37,716 --> 01:57:39,718
You sure you wanna do this?

1655
01:57:39,751 --> 01:57:41,220
I have to.

1656
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:50,196
[sighs]

1657
01:58:23,462 --> 01:58:25,231
I-95.

1658
01:58:25,264 --> 01:58:27,633
Barry, the Crow, the Snake,
and a few others.

1659
01:58:27,666 --> 01:58:29,535
The trees haven't
changed that much,

1660
01:58:29,568 --> 01:58:31,904
so maybe Massachusetts,

1661
01:58:31,937 --> 01:58:33,839
- but they're close.
- Rose?

1662
01:58:33,872 --> 01:58:35,741
Didn't see her.

1663
01:58:35,774 --> 01:58:37,310
But they're coming.

1664
01:58:41,213 --> 01:58:43,582
This is the only room she saw?

1665
01:58:43,615 --> 01:58:44,917
That's right.

1666
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:48,320
And I made a few changes.
Hid a few things.

1667
01:58:48,353 --> 01:58:50,356
All right.

1668
01:58:50,389 --> 01:58:52,625
Well, they'll be trying
to track you,

1669
01:58:52,658 --> 01:58:54,460
trying to catch on.

1670
01:58:56,328 --> 01:58:57,630
And you're gonna let them.

1671
01:58:59,198 --> 01:59:00,499
Are you crazy?

1672
01:59:00,532 --> 01:59:02,768
Possibly, but you're
gonna let them.

1673
01:59:02,801 --> 01:59:05,304
And then I need you to try
and do a little trick.

1674
01:59:06,338 --> 01:59:07,640
A magic trick?

1675
01:59:15,514 --> 01:59:17,550
They're following us.

1676
01:59:17,583 --> 01:59:20,419
Concentrate. You gotta keep it
up until they land.

1677
01:59:20,452 --> 01:59:21,420
I know.

1678
01:59:53,385 --> 01:59:54,687
This should work.

1679
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:57,256
Good blinds over there,
and there.

1680
02:00:00,559 --> 02:00:01,660
They still close?

1681
02:00:01,693 --> 02:00:02,795
Getting closer, I think.

1682
02:00:03,695 --> 02:00:04,830
This is tough.

1683
02:00:04,863 --> 02:00:07,366
I know. I know.
Not much longer.

1684
02:00:10,969 --> 02:00:12,572
Okay, Crow Daddy,

1685
02:00:13,572 --> 02:00:14,874
go get her.

1686
02:01:01,820 --> 02:01:04,490
You look relaxed.

1687
02:01:04,523 --> 02:01:06,926
You feel relaxed,
don't you, Abra?

1688
02:01:08,327 --> 02:01:09,395
I guess.

1689
02:01:09,428 --> 02:01:10,563
[Andi] You should.

1690
02:01:11,363 --> 02:01:12,998
Just relax.

1691
02:01:13,031 --> 02:01:14,667
We're friends.

1692
02:01:14,700 --> 02:01:16,435
You're friends.

1693
02:01:16,468 --> 02:01:17,603
[Andi] That's right.

1694
02:01:18,637 --> 02:01:20,739
Just friends.

1695
02:01:20,772 --> 02:01:23,809
And we want to take you
to meet more friends.

1696
02:01:25,577 --> 02:01:26,712
Good friends.

1697
02:01:31,049 --> 02:01:32,551
Well, shit.

1698
02:01:32,584 --> 02:01:34,053
The way they talked you up,

1699
02:01:34,086 --> 02:01:36,088
I was thinking it'd be
a little harder than that.

1700

[chuckles]

1701

You deserve it. All of you.

for you, sweetie.

Abra!

[David] Get away from her.

Step back.

Sure thing, Dad.

You know, I'm glad
I got to meet you.

I'll fucking kill you.

she's maybe the best food
we'll ever have.

02:06:51,970 --> 02:06:54,039
You've been dosed, missy.

More than
I've ever used before.

Might let you wake up
here and there,

What happened to my dad?

Lot of good people
killed today.

Lot of good people.

I'd love to tell you
someone will pay,

some kind of justice raining
down on the sad events today,

So, their deaths,

all of them,

1791
02:07:45,023 --> 02:07:47,292
just a waste.

to us all, young lady.

hearing you.

Might as well calm down
and enjoy the ride.

[breathes heavily]

1803
02:08:26,998 --> 02:08:28,200
[Dan] No.

1804
02:08:29,934 --> 02:08:31,369
Please.

1805
02:08:31,402 --> 02:08:33,472
Oh, please, please, please.

1806
02:08:35,039 --> 02:08:36,075
Please.

1807
02:08:39,778 --> 02:08:41,046
Abra!

1808
02:08:44,315 --> 02:08:45,718
Abra.

02:08:46,551 --> 02:08:47,886
[grunts]

02:08:47,919 --> 02:08:49,922
[breathing heavily]

1811
02:08:52,791 --> 02:08:54,059
Tony?

1812
02:08:56,094 --> 02:08:57,963
Help me, please, Tony.

1813
02:09:03,568 --> 02:09:04,870
God.

1814
02:09:10,975 --> 02:09:12,211
[sobs]

1815
02:09:15,213 --> 02:09:17,415
Okay. Okay.

1816
02:09:17,448 --> 02:09:18,984
Okay, okay.

1817
02:09:19,017 --> 02:09:21,419
Okay, you always said...
[sniffs]

1818
02:09:21,452 --> 02:09:23,221
Your brain was like a radio.

1819
02:09:23,254 --> 02:09:26,057
No one's answering when you
call, so stop calling.

1820
02:09:26,090 --> 02:09:27,493
And just listen.

1821
02:09:29,961 --> 02:09:31,230

02:09:45,243 --> 02:09:47,579
[Abra] Dan. Dan.

1824
02:09:47,612 --> 02:09:49,014
Help.

1825
02:10:03,094 --> 02:10:04,196
Hi.

1826
02:10:04,229 --> 02:10:05,297
[whispers] Dan.

1827
02:10:08,499 --> 02:10:09,868
Did he drug you?

1828
02:10:11,236 --> 02:10:12,404
I'm so sorry.

1829
02:10:14,172 --> 02:10:16,107
I'm gonna try something, okay?

1830
02:10:16,140 --> 02:10:17,108
But you're weak.

1831
02:10:17,141 --> 02:10:18,977
He's blocking you.

1832
02:10:19,010 --> 02:10:21,146
I could barely hear you.

1833
02:10:21,179 --> 02:10:22,848
You gotta trust me, okay?

1834
02:10:24,482 --> 02:10:25,951
Okay?

1835
02:10:39,898 --> 02:10:42,300
Awake again, huh?

1836
02:10:42,333 --> 02:10:45,504
[clicks tongue] Might have to
dose you at the next rest stop.

1837
02:10:47,572 --> 02:10:49,074
Where are we going?

1838
02:10:50,041 --> 02:10:51,276
Mm, you know where.

1839
02:10:52,343 --> 02:10:54,413
Fuck, I feel hungover.

1840
02:10:57,282 --> 02:10:59,951
I told you it's good shit.

1841
02:10:59,984 --> 02:11:03,088
Haven't felt hungover in years.
And, you know, I don't miss it.

1842
02:11:03,121 --> 02:11:04,323
Not even a little.

1843
02:11:06,457 --> 02:11:08,260
West, huh?

1844
02:11:08,293 --> 02:11:11,196
Stayin' off the major roads.
Smart.

1845
02:11:13,264 --> 02:11:16,001
Crownville. New York.

1846
02:11:19,170 --> 02:11:21,406
Who are you?

1847
02:11:21,439 --> 02:11:23,242
I'm the guy
that killed your friends.

1848
02:11:29,213 --> 02:11:30,582
It's nice to meet you.

1849
02:11:32,450 --> 02:11:34,085
Neat trick.

1850
02:11:34,118 --> 02:11:36,054
Haven't seen this one before.

1851
02:11:36,087 --> 02:11:37,656
Wanna see one more?

1852
02:11:41,092 --> 02:11:44,563
Don't imagine Rose'll be too
happy if you shoot the prize.

1853
02:11:47,298 --> 02:11:50,702
I don't suppose Rose will be
happy about any of this.

1854
02:11:50,735 --> 02:11:53,471
And when that woman gets mad...

1855
02:11:53,504 --> 02:11:56,107
Well, it seems to me
you know enough

1856
02:11:56,140 --> 02:11:59,010
to know you might wanna
sit this one out.

1857
02:11:59,043 --> 02:12:00,478
Count your blessings.

1858
02:12:00,511 --> 02:12:02,347
Go on your way.

1859
02:12:02,380 --> 02:12:04,482
[chuckles]

1860
02:12:04,515 --> 02:12:06,184
What's so funny, friend?

1861
02:12:06,217 --> 02:12:10,188
Well, it's just arrogance.
It's arrogance, really.

1862
02:12:10,221 --> 02:12:13,591
But it makes sense,
if you think you're gonna live forever.

1863
02:12:13,624 --> 02:12:17,996
Stands to reason,
of course you wouldn't wear your seatbelt.

02:12:41,219 --> 02:12:42,387
Dan?

1868
02:12:44,022 --> 02:12:45,290
Dan?

02:13:16,587 --> 02:13:18,156
I hope that hurts.

Rosie...

02:13:21,092 --> 02:13:22,127
A lot.

[pained screaming]

02:14:10,141 --> 02:14:12,177
You little bitch.

1876
02:14:14,278 --> 02:14:16,348
What have you done?

1877
02:14:27,725 --> 02:14:29,494
All right, bitch child.

1878
02:14:30,528 --> 02:14:31,430
All right.

02:15:39,830 --> 02:15:41,266
Sorry.

1882
02:15:41,299 --> 02:15:42,433
Dozed off.

1883
02:15:42,466 --> 02:15:44,169
No, you earned it.

1884
02:15:47,505 --> 02:15:48,706
Where are we?

1885
02:15:48,739 --> 02:15:50,208
Ohio.

1886
02:15:50,741 --> 02:15:51,843
Where are we going?

1887
02:15:51,876 --> 02:15:52,878
Colorado.

1888
02:15:54,579 --> 02:15:56,148
Why Colorado?

1889
02:15:58,649 --> 02:16:00,418
She's gonna keep coming.

1890
02:16:01,552 --> 02:16:03,155
- I know.
- Always.

1891
02:16:04,522 --> 02:16:05,890
This only ends if we end it,

1892
02:16:05,923 --> 02:16:08,359
and I don't think
we can beat her.

1893
02:16:08,392 --> 02:16:09,828
Not by ourselves.

1894
02:16:11,996 --> 02:16:13,631
There's a place.

1895
02:16:13,664 --> 02:16:16,467
A place that's dangerous
for people like us.

1896
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:19,637
The place you told me about?
The hungry place?

1897
02:16:19,670 --> 02:16:21,306
Yeah, that's right.

1898
02:16:21,339 --> 02:16:24,209
If it's so dangerous,
why would we go there?

1899
02:16:24,242 --> 02:16:26,611
Well, if it's dangerous
for people like us,

1900
02:16:26,644 --> 02:16:29,547
I expect it's dangerous
for people like her.

1901
02:16:29,580 --> 02:16:31,316
Maybe even more so.

1902
02:16:32,383 --> 02:16:33,351
Good.

1903
02:16:34,452 --> 02:16:36,221
She's following us, you know.

1904
02:16:37,321 --> 02:16:39,224
Yeah, good. Let her.

1905
02:16:46,831 --> 02:16:48,533
I'm sorry about your father.

1906
02:16:51,302 --> 02:16:52,771
Sorry about your friend.

1909
02:17:18,029 --> 02:17:19,364
What do I say to her?

[mutters]

1911
02:17:24,035 --> 02:17:24,969
Hi, Mom.

1912
02:17:25,002 --> 02:17:26,337
Oh, thank God!

1913
02:17:26,370 --> 02:17:27,505
Abra... [sniffling]

1914
02:17:27,538 --> 02:17:29,241
Are you okay? Where are you?

1915
02:17:30,074 --> 02:17:31,476
I love you.

1916
02:17:32,443 --> 02:17:34,479
[cell phone clicks]

1917
02:17:34,512 --> 02:17:36,848
When we're safe, you'll call her
and tell her where to find us?

1918
02:17:36,881 --> 02:17:38,016
I will.

1919
02:17:38,049 --> 02:17:39,451
Okay.

[cell phone clatters]

1921
02:18:13,084 --> 02:18:15,487
Not too much further.

[wind whistling]

1923
02:19:51,048 --> 02:19:52,817
Here's what we're gonna do.

1924
02:19:52,850 --> 02:19:55,686
You're gonna stay in the car,
keep the heater running.

1925
02:19:55,719 --> 02:19:58,890
I don't want you spending a minute
inside there if you don't have to.

1926
02:19:58,923 --> 02:20:00,658
She can only come from here.

1927
02:20:00,691 --> 02:20:02,193
You can see her a mile out,
easy.

1928
02:20:02,226 --> 02:20:04,562
You see lights
on the mountain over there,

1929
02:20:04,595 --> 02:20:06,130
you blast me, okay?

1930
02:20:06,163 --> 02:20:09,600
But I don't want you going in.
Not until she's here.

1931
02:20:09,633 --> 02:20:12,103
You aren't waiting with me?

1932
02:20:12,136 --> 02:20:13,070
I can't.

1933
02:20:13,103 --> 02:20:14,105
Why not?

1934
02:20:15,072 --> 02:20:16,674
I have to wake it up.

1950
02:26:01,385 --> 02:26:03,254
Not for long, I imagine.

1951
02:26:05,055 --> 02:26:07,057
[man] You're a whiskey man,
are you not?

1952
02:26:07,090 --> 02:26:09,193
I was, most of the time.

1953
02:26:16,867 --> 02:26:18,269
[man] On the house.

1954
02:26:22,039 --> 02:26:24,175
This was your brand.

1955
02:26:24,208 --> 02:26:26,010
Jack Daniel's.

1956
02:26:26,043 --> 02:26:28,412
I used to see the bottles
in our home.

1957
02:26:28,445 --> 02:26:31,949
Our real home, before all this.

1958
02:26:31,982 --> 02:26:35,153
I smelled one once. It smelled
like something on fire,

1959
02:26:36,320 --> 02:26:38,989
which I suppose it was.

1960
02:26:39,022 --> 02:26:41,525
[man] I'm afraid you've
confused me with someone else.

1961
02:26:41,558 --> 02:26:43,094
It's Lloyd.

1962
02:26:43,594 --> 02:26:44,996
Lloyd.

1963
02:26:46,330 --> 02:26:48,465
I apologize, Mr. Torrance.

1964
02:26:48,498 --> 02:26:52,403
I don't know where everyone is,
but it'll pick up.

1965
02:26:52,436 --> 02:26:54,305
Oh, I know where they are.

1966
02:26:54,338 --> 02:26:55,439
And you're right...

1967
02:26:56,306 --> 02:26:57,475
it'll pick up.

1968
02:26:59,643 --> 02:27:02,446
If you don't mind my saying,
Mr. Torrance, you seem...

1969
02:27:04,081 --> 02:27:05,216
put upon.

1970
02:27:06,216 --> 02:27:08,052
Put upon?

1971
02:27:08,085 --> 02:27:09,353
Ain't that the way.

1972
02:27:10,354 --> 02:27:12,289
Man just living his life,

1973
02:27:12,322 --> 02:27:14,391
trying to do his work.

1974
02:27:14,424 --> 02:27:16,493
He gets put upon.

1975
02:27:16,526 --> 02:27:18,262
Pulled into
other people's problems.

1976
02:27:18,295 --> 02:27:21,132
I see it all the time,
if you don't mind my saying.

1977
02:27:24,101 --> 02:27:26,103
So we lived in Florida.

1978
02:27:27,137 --> 02:27:28,138
I'm sorry?

1979
02:27:28,171 --> 02:27:30,207
Mom and I.

1980
02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:32,510
I'm afraid I don't know
who you mean.

1981
02:27:35,045 --> 02:27:38,015
We never wanted
to see snow again,

1982
02:27:38,048 --> 02:27:40,217
so we lived in Florida.

1983
02:27:40,250 --> 02:27:43,487
Tiny place, but it was
comfortable, and we were happy.

1984
02:27:43,520 --> 02:27:45,423
I mean, we were grieving.

1985
02:27:48,191 --> 02:27:50,127
We were traumatized,

1986
02:27:50,160 --> 02:27:51,929
but there was happiness too.

1987
02:27:55,132 --> 02:27:56,100
She...

1988
02:27:57,634 --> 02:27:59,904
She would look away.

1989
02:27:59,937 --> 02:28:03,341
She'd look at me, but she'd always
look away after a second or two.

1990
02:28:04,608 --> 02:28:06,443
It took me a while
to notice it.

1991
02:28:06,476 --> 02:28:08,913
But after the Overlook, she
wouldn't look me in the eyes,

1992
02:28:08,946 --> 02:28:10,648
not for long.

1993
02:28:10,681 --> 02:28:12,283
Couldn't figure it out.

1994
02:28:14,718 --> 02:28:15,719
But it...

1995
02:28:19,589 --> 02:28:20,958
It was you.

1996
02:28:23,293 --> 02:28:26,964
She saw your eyes in me,
and she'd have to look away.

1997
02:28:28,332 --> 02:28:30,167
It tortured her
to have to do that.

1998
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:32,069
So, I fixed it.

1999
02:28:32,102 --> 02:28:35,105
I fixed it for her, and it was
the last time I ever used it.

2000
02:28:35,138 --> 02:28:38,175
So that she wouldn't see you
anymore when she looked at me.

2001
02:28:41,244 --> 02:28:43,514
I was 20 when she died.

2002
02:28:43,547 --> 02:28:47,384
And back then, I saw
when someone was gonna die.

2003
02:28:47,417 --> 02:28:49,586
I saw flies. Black flies.

2004
02:28:49,619 --> 02:28:53,457
"Death flies," I called them,
circling people's faces.

2005
02:28:53,490 --> 02:28:56,327
And in those last weeks,
she was covered...

2006
02:28:56,360 --> 02:28:58,195
Her whole face.

2007
02:28:58,228 --> 02:29:01,332
I could barely see her eyes.

2008
02:29:01,365 --> 02:29:06,270
And I... I tried to comfort her,
but I could hardly look at her.

2009
02:29:06,303 --> 02:29:08,205
And she saw that.

2010
02:29:10,540 --> 02:29:12,609
She just lay there dying,

2011
02:29:12,642 --> 02:29:14,545
with her son
who couldn't look at her.

2012
02:29:20,584 --> 02:29:24,254
Maybe something warm to
push away such unpleasantries.

2013
02:29:24,287 --> 02:29:27,324
Don't you wanna hear about it?
She was your wife.

2014
02:29:27,357 --> 02:29:30,461
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

2015
02:29:30,494 --> 02:29:33,764
- I'm just a bartender.
- Oh, yeah?

2016
02:29:33,797 --> 02:29:37,034
Just Lloyd the bartender,
pouring joy at the Overlook Hotel.

2017
02:29:37,067 --> 02:29:39,637
I'll pour whatever you like,
Mr. Torrance.

2018
02:29:41,238 --> 02:29:42,373
Oh, Dad.

2019
02:29:44,307 --> 02:29:46,510
This drink will cost
an awful lot.

2020
02:29:46,543 --> 02:29:48,545
Your money is no good here.

2021
02:29:48,578 --> 02:29:50,414
Orders from the house.

2022
02:29:50,447 --> 02:29:52,383
It'll cost more than money.

2023
02:29:52,416 --> 02:29:54,752
It'll cost me eight years.

2024
02:29:54,785 --> 02:29:57,287
Eight behind me, and who knows
how many in front of me.

2025
02:29:57,320 --> 02:29:59,757
Your credit is fine,
Mr. Torrance.

2026
02:30:07,230 --> 02:30:09,100
Man takes a drink,

2027
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:11,502
the drink takes a drink,

2028
02:30:12,669 --> 02:30:14,505
and then the drink takes a man.

2029
02:30:15,572 --> 02:30:17,274
Ain't it so, Dad?

2030
02:30:21,411 --> 02:30:22,713
Medicine.

2031
02:30:24,414 --> 02:30:26,283
Medicine is what it is.

2032
02:30:27,284 --> 02:30:29,520
Bona fide cure-all.

2033
02:30:29,553 --> 02:30:34,392
Depression, stress, remorse,
failure, wipes it all away.

2034
02:30:36,159 --> 02:30:38,229
The mind is a blackboard.

2035
02:30:38,695 --> 02:30:40,031
And this

2036
02:30:40,730 --> 02:30:42,233
is the eraser.

2037
02:30:47,504 --> 02:30:49,606
A man tries.

2038
02:30:49,639 --> 02:30:50,775
He provides.

2039
02:30:52,175 --> 02:30:54,344
But he's surrounded by mouths.

2040
02:30:54,377 --> 02:30:57,481
That eat, and scream, and cry,
and nag.

2041
02:30:57,514 --> 02:31:01,118
So, he asks for one thing,
just one thing for him.

2042
02:31:01,151 --> 02:31:02,653
To warm him up...

2043
02:31:02,686 --> 02:31:05,722
to take the sting out of
those days of the mouths,

2044
02:31:05,755 --> 02:31:08,492
eating, and eating, and eating
everything he makes,

2045
02:31:08,525 --> 02:31:11,095
everything he has.

2046
02:31:11,128 --> 02:31:12,663
And a family.

2047
02:31:12,696 --> 02:31:14,799
A wife, a kid.

2048
02:31:16,333 --> 02:31:18,669
Those mouths eat time.

2049
02:31:18,702 --> 02:31:20,304
They eat your days on Earth.

2050
02:31:21,705 --> 02:31:23,307
They just gobble them up.

2051
02:31:24,774 --> 02:31:27,178
It's enough to make a man sick.

2052
02:31:28,145 --> 02:31:29,213
And this...

2053
02:31:30,547 --> 02:31:32,450
is the medicine.

2054
02:31:34,584 --> 02:31:37,521
So, tell me, pup,

2055
02:31:37,554 --> 02:31:40,191
are you gonna
take your medicine?

2056
02:31:43,226 --> 02:31:44,795
I'm not.

2057
02:31:44,828 --> 02:31:45,830
[glass shatters]

2058
02:31:46,830 --> 02:31:48,165
Oh.

2059
02:31:48,198 --> 02:31:49,533
Look at that. I'm sorry.

2060
02:31:49,566 --> 02:31:52,536
Clumsy old me, Mr. Torrance.
Forgive me.

2061
02:31:54,171 --> 02:31:55,539
Let's get you cleaned up.

2062
02:32:13,857 --> 02:32:15,826
Management is concerned.

2063
02:32:15,859 --> 02:32:17,228
Concerned?

2064
02:32:19,596 --> 02:32:22,166
It's horrible
what she's done to you.

2065
02:32:22,199 --> 02:32:23,868
Pulled you into her mess.

2066
02:32:26,369 --> 02:32:27,738
A smart man?

2067
02:32:28,772 --> 02:32:31,775
He'd let her handle it.

2068
02:32:31,808 --> 02:32:35,312
Let things unfold
as they're meant to.

2069
02:32:35,345 --> 02:32:37,715
Why should you
pay her tab, Doc?

2070
02:32:39,449 --> 02:32:41,485
And for what?

2071
02:32:41,518 --> 02:32:45,355
For this little girl
who started all this trouble?

2072
02:32:45,388 --> 02:32:47,925
What would management
have me do about that?

2073
02:32:48,592 --> 02:32:50,727
Nothing.

2074
02:32:50,760 --> 02:32:53,664
Easiest thing in the world
to do, son.

2075
02:32:53,697 --> 02:32:55,866
Just bring her inside.

2076
02:32:55,899 --> 02:32:58,368
And then, well,

2077
02:32:58,401 --> 02:33:01,505
you accept the things
you cannot change.

2078
02:33:02,672 --> 02:33:03,807
[Abra] Dan!

2079
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:04,875
She's here.

2080
02:33:22,892 --> 02:33:24,361
[Dan] Okay.

2081
02:33:38,808 --> 02:33:41,511
This place is sick.

2082
02:33:41,544 --> 02:33:43,880
Sick like my momo was sick.

2083
02:33:43,913 --> 02:33:45,515
It's cancer,

2084
02:33:45,548 --> 02:33:47,818
only worse.

2085

[electricity humming]

What do we do now?

2087
02:33:56,660 --> 02:33:58,696
We head inside. She'll find us.

02:35:48,671 --> 02:35:51,375
[Rose] Well, well, well.

2091
02:35:52,876 --> 02:35:54,578
Hi there.

2092
02:35:54,611 --> 02:35:57,814
[Dan] When this starts, run.

2093
02:35:57,847 --> 02:36:00,684
[Rose] Yes, you run, dear.

2094
02:36:00,717 --> 02:36:03,053
And then I will find you

2095
02:36:03,086 --> 02:36:06,957
and you will scream for years
until you die.

2096
02:36:09,025 --> 02:36:11,661
We'll see
who does the screaming.

2097
02:36:11,694 --> 02:36:13,463
Oh, we'll see indeed.

2098
02:36:13,496 --> 02:36:15,465
[Dan] She's right, you know.

2099
02:36:15,498 --> 02:36:16,967
You should be afraid.

2100
02:36:18,134 --> 02:36:20,537
Why is that?

2101
02:36:20,570 --> 02:36:23,140
Because you don't know
where you're standing.

2102
02:36:23,173 --> 02:36:25,409
I'm sorry, who are you,
handsome?

You're the one who killed
my Crow, aren't you?

2104
02:36:34,551 --> 02:36:35,552
Go.

[Rose] Clever.

02:37:39,048 --> 02:37:40,884
You've made some improvements,
haven't you?

2110
02:37:42,552 --> 02:37:45,055
Since the last time
I was in your mind.

[Abra] How do you know
we're not in yours?

You're gonna die here.

Mm. Brave words, dear.

2116

Is that what you really think?

You're gonna hurt me?

you remind me of myself.

I can really see it now.

02:39:12,275 --> 02:39:15,779
But I promise you, dear,
oh, you'd be surprised.

2131
02:39:17,146 --> 02:39:18,015
[grunts]

2132
02:39:19,916 --> 02:39:21,184
[sighs]

2133
02:39:21,217 --> 02:39:23,120
[Abra] Pain purifies steam.

2134
02:39:24,220 --> 02:39:28,091
Fear, too, so, you understand.

2135
02:39:41,104 --> 02:39:42,072
[grunts softly]

2136
02:39:46,342 --> 02:39:47,911
[Abra choking]

2137
02:39:47,944 --> 02:39:50,714
I was just like you
when I was younger.

2138
02:39:50,747 --> 02:39:52,115
I was special

2139
02:39:53,082 --> 02:39:55,118
and alone.

2140
02:39:55,151 --> 02:39:57,787
But I met someone who gave me the
gift of purpose, of community.

2141
02:39:57,820 --> 02:39:59,823
And I might have given you
such a gift

2142
02:39:59,856 --> 02:40:02,759
if things would
have gone differently.

2143
02:40:05,428 --> 02:40:07,697
No?

2144
02:40:07,730 --> 02:40:09,633
Defiant, aren't you?

2145
02:40:09,666 --> 02:40:10,734
[continues choking]

2146
02:40:10,767 --> 02:40:12,168
So much like me.

2147
02:40:12,201 --> 02:40:15,205
Your mind is so...

2148
02:40:17,807 --> 02:40:19,810
This isn't your mind, is it?

2149
02:40:22,378 --> 02:40:24,114
This isn't you at all.

2150
02:40:26,349 --> 02:40:28,685
You're just the bait.

2151
02:40:30,820 --> 02:40:32,122
[grunts]

2152
02:40:32,155 --> 02:40:33,123
Enough!

2153
02:40:35,324 --> 02:40:36,393
[gasps]

2154
02:40:36,426 --> 02:40:37,928
[Dan panting] Run.

2155
02:40:40,129 --> 02:40:42,265
How the hell did we miss you?

2156
02:40:42,965 --> 02:40:44,134
[groans]

2157
02:40:44,167 --> 02:40:45,402
Oh...

2158
02:40:45,435 --> 02:40:48,005
You and I should have met
years ago.

2159
02:40:51,474 --> 02:40:52,743
Danny.

2160
02:40:53,810 --> 02:40:57,714
That's your name, isn't it?

2161
02:40:57,747 --> 02:41:01,217
Well, something happens to the
steam when you rubes get older.

2162
02:41:01,250 --> 02:41:03,386
It gets polluted.

2163
02:41:03,419 --> 02:41:05,121
Dirty.

2164
02:41:05,154 --> 02:41:06,156
You know that.

2165
02:41:07,423 --> 02:41:10,193
I see the grease all over you.

2166
02:41:10,226 --> 02:41:13,196
You don't shine quite the same.

2167
02:41:13,229 --> 02:41:15,766
Growing up spoils that,
I guess.

2168
02:41:18,067 --> 02:41:20,003
Seriously, handsome,

2169
02:41:20,036 --> 02:41:22,739
where have you been hiding?

2170
02:41:25,742 --> 02:41:27,444
I can make you an offer.

2171
02:41:28,945 --> 02:41:30,780
An offer I rarely make.

2172
02:41:30,813 --> 02:41:33,249
Oh, yeah? I can't wait.

2173
02:41:33,282 --> 02:41:35,185
Such a gifted boy

2174
02:41:35,218 --> 02:41:39,055
hiding his light
under a bushel for so long.

2175
02:41:39,088 --> 02:41:43,460
You could live a long, long
time. Live well, too.

2176
02:41:43,493 --> 02:41:48,031
Indulge yourself,
no consequences,

2177
02:41:48,064 --> 02:41:49,700
no hangovers.

2178
02:41:51,300 --> 02:41:53,970
Eat well, live long.

2179
02:41:54,003 --> 02:41:56,973
You must be lonely,
being the last one.

2180
02:41:57,006 --> 02:41:59,142
I mean,
the last one in the world.

2181
02:41:59,175 --> 02:42:01,812
Sweetie, I'm not the last.
Far from it.

2182
02:42:03,045 --> 02:42:04,881
I'm just the prettiest.

2183
02:42:04,914 --> 02:42:06,950
I assume you know my answer.

2184
02:42:08,451 --> 02:42:09,786
Pity.

2185
02:42:09,819 --> 02:42:11,321
So, are we doing this or not?

2186
02:42:12,388 --> 02:42:14,391

- [continues groaning]
- Oh, look at that, huh?

2194
02:42:38,014 --> 02:42:42,252
I seem to have nicked
your femoral artery there.

2195
02:42:42,285 --> 02:42:44,321
Why, you're gonna
bleed to death, huh?

My, my, what a temper you have.

2199
02:42:52,929 --> 02:42:54,430
So much fire.

2200
02:42:54,463 --> 02:42:56,232
Such a waste!

2201
02:42:56,265 --> 02:42:57,901

[inhales deeply]

Something special, huh?

Abra.

You've been very, very bad.

You're not Uncle Dan.

2263

Mask is off, then.

Why are you smiling?

Because you don't know
where you're standing.

[scoffs] I know these halls

[Abra] Come on, Uncle Dan.

2301
02:51:02,351 --> 02:51:03,486
Get out of there.

2302
02:51:04,920 --> 02:51:06,022
Come on.

[sirens approaching]

The fire spread fast,

2305
02:51:20,069 --> 02:51:22,038
destroying the hotel.

2306
02:51:22,071 --> 02:51:23,640
Purifying it.

2307
02:51:25,074 --> 02:51:27,076
I could almost hear it...

2308
02:51:27,109 --> 02:51:28,011
screaming.

2309
02:51:29,611 --> 02:51:32,348
I could hear it dying.

2310
02:51:32,381 --> 02:51:34,917
And deep inside, I knew...

2311
02:51:37,786 --> 02:51:39,422
I knew you were okay.

2312
02:51:40,989 --> 02:51:42,859
I'm sorry I put you in danger.

2313
02:51:44,026 --> 02:51:45,428
It was the only way.

2314
02:51:46,495 --> 02:51:47,730
I know.

2315
02:51:48,831 --> 02:51:51,967
Do you think she was right

2316
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,037
when she said
she wasn't the last one?

2317
02:51:55,404 --> 02:51:56,806
The world's a hungry place.

2318
02:51:57,673 --> 02:52:00,343
A dark place.

2319
02:52:00,376 --> 02:52:03,946
Maybe there's more of them
or things like them or worse,

2320
02:52:03,979 --> 02:52:05,815
but there are more people
like you, too.

2321
02:52:06,648 --> 02:52:08,384
People who stand.

2322
02:52:11,854 --> 02:52:13,723
I told you
when I first met you,

2323
02:52:13,756 --> 02:52:16,392
I told you that
you should hide.

2324
02:52:17,793 --> 02:52:19,796
That you should
keep your head down.

2325
02:52:20,896 --> 02:52:22,832
Keep your shine out of sight.

2326
02:52:24,900 --> 02:52:26,336
But I was wrong.

2327
02:52:29,571 --> 02:52:31,341
Shine on, Abra Stone.

2328
02:52:34,443 --> 02:52:36,679
You shine on.

2329

Who are you talking to?

2332
02:52:47,423 --> 02:52:48,858
No one.

2333
02:52:48,891 --> 02:52:49,992
Hmm.

2334
02:52:56,732 --> 02:52:57,967
That's not true.

2335
02:53:02,104 --> 02:53:03,606
I was talking to Dan.

2336
02:53:11,480 --> 02:53:13,616
We go on after.

2337
02:53:14,516 --> 02:53:16,185
We go on.

2338
02:53:16,218 --> 02:53:17,620
And he's okay.

2339
02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:19,922
So is Daddy.

2340
02:53:21,123 --> 02:53:22,592
He really is.

2341
02:53:26,595 --> 02:53:27,864
Good.

2342
02:53:39,475 --> 02:53:40,843
