1
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,500
Well, what I want to know, honey,
is what are you gonna do now?

2
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:04,370
I'm gonna be happy for a change.
After all, he ain't the only man in the world.

3
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,540
There's plenty of good fish in the sea,
I always say.

4
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,770
Besides, I was getting kind of sick of him.
It's time I run into somebody new.

5
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:26,220
- I want to go home. I want to go home.
- You always want to go home.

6
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,660
Say, why don't you watch
where you're going?

7
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,430
You might have hurt this lady.

8
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,000
Come on. Young fool.

9
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,190
- Glad you liked it.
- Do you work every day?

10
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,290
- Sure.
- Be here tomorrow?

11
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,030
- Of course. Always.
- Good night, then.

12
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,190
Good night, Millie.

13
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,330
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

14
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:50,070
I want to get the state prison at Huntsburg.
No. No. I don't know the number.

15
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,610
- She always drink two malts?
- Oh, let her. It's good for business.

16
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,020
- Your business. Monkey business.
- What?

17
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,390
- Sandy, what's the matter?
- Just a minute.

18
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,730
- Can I have some change, please?
- Why, certainly.

19
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,950
- All right.
- Sandy, I didn't do anything.

20
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,120
- Not yet you didn't do anything.
- I was just waiting...

21
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:39,420
Hello, this is Mr. Edward Miller.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Gillette, please.

22
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,260
It's very important.

23
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,060
What?

24
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,700
Two weeks? Well, what's his number there?

25
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,680
But I've got to reach him. I told you,
it's very important. It's a matter of life or...

26
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,170
Well, listen.
There must be a phone near where he is.

27
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,280
Well, can't you...
Well, can you please tell me if...

28
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:17,260
All right. All right. All right!

29
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,810
I guess, I do. But you make me so mad.

30
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,710
- Did you get your party?
- Didn't get his party.

31
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,350
Do you know how much coffee
I've had today? Seventeen cups.

32
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,760
The Brazilians ought to give me a medal.
What is it?

33
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,850
Second-degree burns.
Chadwick's in with him.

34
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:59,270
- Here's his card.
- Edward Burnside. Well, the name fits.

35
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,170
Right hand. Electric stove.

36
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,070
Yeah, friend, a man's got no business
fooling around with stoves.

37
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,240
They're strictly a woman's business.
You're not married?

38
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,580
- No.
- You're missing a big deal, friend.

39
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,740
So you get married.
So your wife does all the cooking.

40
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,410
So she's the one that gets burned.
So what happens?

41
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,980
So she comes and cries on your shoulder,

42
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,120
and you pat her head
and give her a kiss or two.

43
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,500
Yeah, that's living. Keep your hand still.

44
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,200
Next day she tells you to climb on a ladder
and clean out the closet,

45
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,800
and you fall and break a leg. I don't know.
They got you coming and going.

46
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,500
- Everything all right?
- Just finished.

47
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,780
You'll have to sign this, Mr. Burnside.
Your left hand will do.

48
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,650
- Can I see you a minute outside, Chad?
- Sure.

49
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,490
You notice anything funny about...

50
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,470
Outside of the fact that
he did it on purpose, no.

51
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,800
- You think it was self-inflicted?
- Look, to get a second degree like that,

52
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,240
he'd have had to hold his hand on a burner
a couple of seconds, at least.

53
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,300
Sure it was self-inflicted.

54
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,300
Give me a minute, will you?

55
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,090
Mr. Burnside, I want to ask you a question.
Were you ever in a mental hospital?

56
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,430
- Only when I was imprisoned.
- Prison?

57
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,630
- In the psycho ward. But they let me go.
- Why?

58
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:47,510
My sentence was up. Dr. Gillette wanted
to keep me, but they let me go.

59
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,310
- What'd you go up for?
- I...

60
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,340
I hit someone, a girl.

61
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,690
- Why?
- I don't know.

62
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,090
- How do you feel now?
- Not right. I don't feel right.

63
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,060
You gonna keep me here?

64
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:12,660
I don't know.
Stay where you are for a minute, will you?

65
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,940
- Well?
- I'm gonna send him upstairs.

66
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,210
- You crazy?
- Not as crazy as he is.

67
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,940
He'll make five loopies you've sent
up in the past two weeks.

68
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,580
- Where are the rest of them now?
- That's not my fault.

69
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,920
Look, forget it. They'll only wrap him up in a
cold sheet, keep him around for three days,

70
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,980
then give him back to the Indians.
Besides, we've got some more business.

71
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,960
All right, boys, full house coming in.
One stretcher. One warm.

72
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,060
Great. Let's go, Chad.

73
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,300
Okay, friend, you can go now.

74
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,250
A little room, Mac. A little room.

75
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,880
Listen, don't you think
this is a funny way to get hurt?

76
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,980
- Sure, friend.
- Don't...

77
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,940
- Aren't you away yet, Miller?
- I will be in a minute.

78
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,540
- It's not easy with this hand.
- You sure you can drive?

79
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,520
- Don't worry, I can drive.
- I don't worry. The company worries.

80
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,490
And just remember, if you have an accident,
you're responsible.

81
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,950
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- Cleaner.

82
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,350
<i>All right, Eddie.</i>

83
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,780
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Miss Darr.

84
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,560
I was hoping you'd get here earlier. Just put
them in on the bed. I'll hang them up later.

85
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,170
- What have you been doing?
- What?

86
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,510
- Your hand, you've hurt it.
- I was playing ball yesterday.

87
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,280
- I got spiked in a ball game.
- I didn't know you were a ball player.

88
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,740
- I'm a lot of things.
- Man of many talents.

89
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:48,960
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.
- I never seem to know a man like that.

90
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,690
- Are you going someplace?
- Not unless I get this down.

91
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,160
- Well, here, here. Let me give you a hand.
- Thanks.

92
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,510
Eddie, you're sweet. Just put it on the bed.

93
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,250
Actually, I'm only going away
for a couple of days with a friend of mine.

94
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,180
That's why I was hoping
you'd get here earlier, Eddie.

95
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,310
- I want you to do me a favor, will you?
- Well, if it's something I can.

96
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,290
Well, it's this dress. I tried it on
to see if it was okay this morning,

97
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,720
and then I noticed this stain.
I want to wear it when I go away, Eddie.

98
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:30,430
Do you think Alpine could do a rush job on
it for me and get it back to me by tomorrow?

99
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,970
Well, I don't know.
I'll have to ask one of the men.

100
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,770
- What kind of a stain is it?
- Brandy. At least, I think it's brandy.

101
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,900
There was this drunk the other night,
and I forgot about it.

102
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,670
He must have spilled something,
and I didn't...

103
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,910
- I'll get one of the men to do it.
- Eddie, you're wonderful.

104
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:49,210
Tell you what. You go in the kitchen and get
a beer out of the icebox, and I'll slip this off.

105
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,880
All right.

106
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:00,630
There's an opener right there by the bottles.
Find it all right?

107
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,990
Yes, I found it, Miss Darr.

108
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,240
I'm sorry. I forgot about your hand.
I see you got it opened all right.

109
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,750
Yeah, sure. It was easy.

110
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,480
I didn't know baseball was
such a dangerous game.

111
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,780
- Well, anybody can get hurt anytime.
- You're so right, Eddie.

112
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,990
Not just in games, either. Is it hot out?
I haven't been out yet.

113
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,660
- No, it's nice.
- But you're sweating.

114
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,630
- Am I? I didn't know.
- Well, the beer will cool you off.

115
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,490
Excuse me.

116
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:51,540
What is it? Al?
What are you doing up so early?

117
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,640
Sure. Come on up.

118
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,250
That's my friend. He's coming up.

119
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,780
Eddie, would you mind finishing
your beer out on the back porch?

120
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,630
Al's just like every other trumpet player.
He's jealous.

121
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,690
I wouldn't want him to get any ideas.

122
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,670
And I'll expect the dress tomorrow.
You're a darling, Eddie.

123
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,080
Anyone down there?

124
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,410
Gets better every time.
Play it again, Jeannie girl.

125
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,010
Listen, that's five times
I've played it for you already.

126
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,490
- People might want to hear something else.
- No. They ain't listening.

127
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,460
I'm the only one that's listening.
Play it again, Jeannie girl.

128
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,290
- Pete?
- What's the matter, Jeannie?

129
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,500
- Do you want to run off with me?
- It's this man.

130
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,760
Five times I've played a song for him,
and now he wants to hear it again.

131
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,170
What's the matter?
You know only one song?

132
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,470
Jeannie knows lots of songs.
Let her play and you'll hear a million songs.

133
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,140
I only want to hear this song.

134
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,440
But maybe somebody else
wants to hear something else.

135
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,910
Maybe I want to hear something else.

136
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,280
Listen, I've been paying for this.
I bought nine drinks here tonight.

137
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,350
Maybe nine drinks are too many for you.
Maybe you better go home.

138
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,820
Hey, you can't do that to me.

139
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:48,520
I just did it. Now, are you going to leave
quiet or do you need a little help?

140
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,330
All right. But you'll be sorry.
Nobody's making a fool out of me.

141
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,610
- Nice fellow.
- You ought to be used to it by now.

142
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:05,310
I never get used to it. Jeannie. Play me
something. Play me <i>Plaisir d'amour.</i>

143
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,180
So you can go off in a corner and cry?

144
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,310
With that song and the way business is,
I cry right out in public.

145
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,870
Are you sure you don't want me
to get you a cab?

146
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,340
Walking's the only exercise I get these days.

147
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,310
But I don't like you out alone
like this at night.

148
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,980
What makes you think I'm alone?
After all, I'm leaving early.

149
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,910
How do you know I don't have someone
waiting for me around the corner?

150
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,790
- I wish it was me. Good night, Jeannie.
- Good night, Pete.

151
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:07,410
I almost seen it.
I just finished looking out the window,

152
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,850
and I went back into the kitchen
to take a pill, and I heard this backfire,

153
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,350
and I waited a minute
and I thought to myself

154
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,390
it's a funny kind of a backfire.
I never heard a backfire like that before.

155
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,820
So I went back to the window
and looked and she was laying there,

156
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,690
- and this fellow was bending over her.
- What fellow?

157
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,750
Pete, there. The fellow that owns the bar.
He come running out, I guess.

158
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,160
Look. They're going to take another picture.

159
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,620
- Okay.
- Where's Lieutenant Kafka?

160
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,430
- Inside, him and Ferris both.
- Ask him if he's all through out here.

161
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,700
- We'd like to take off.
- Okay.

162
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,960
They want to know
if they can remove the body, Lieutenant.

163
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,030
Did you get your pictures?

164
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,130
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

165
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,540
How about one with
the sheet off, Lieutenant?

166
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,970
- Just one, that's all.
- Not a chance.

167
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,270
Why not? What's the matter?

168
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,870
Listen, food's too expensive to spoil
people's appetite for breakfast.

169
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,640
I wouldn't want a dead girl on my front page.

170
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,080
You've got one anyway.

171
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,310
I don't like dead girls on the front page
or anywhere else.

172
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,450
Should have been with me last night.

173
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,990
You wouldn't have liked
a couple of live ones.

174
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,050
I had a lot of trouble last night.

175
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,420
You're gonna have a lot of trouble tonight,
too. Get over there to that building.

176
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,300
Start from the roof and check
every apartment that fronts on the street.

177
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,030
I'll be inside seeing what they got to say.

178
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,800
- Right.
- Okay. Break it up. Show's over.

179
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,860
Yes, sir. All right, let's go, boys. Break it up.

180
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,930
All right. Go home. Go home!

181
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,740
Well, you see,
I live across the street over there.

182
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,870
Go across the street.

183
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,740
That little girl shouldn't be out
this time of night.

184
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,370
- I'm her mother.
- Well, that makes her a lucky kid.

185
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,410
Come on, home, please. Go home. Go home!

186
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:34,390
- I still say we were cheated in that game.
- It's just a game.

187
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,260
- I don't care how it came out.
- Fill her up.

188
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,270
Well, I care how it came out.
I had some money bet on the game.

189
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,170
Hey, Mac, you seen that play
on the television tonight, didn't you?

190
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,160
Twenty-five.

191
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,400
The one at second
that all that rhubarb was about?

192
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,450
You know, in the fourth
where they thumbed Parsons out.

193
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,640
- It's what he deserved.
- Are you smiling at me?

194
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,780
- No, I'm smiling at everybody.
- Business good today?

195
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:05,020
- I'm not a businessman.
- This is what businessmen carry around.

196
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,430
- I'm an engineer.
- On the railroads?

197
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:16,360
No. I build things.
You know, bridges and things.

198
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:21,100
I just got back from Hawaii today.
I was building a bridge in Hawaii.

199
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,010
That's why I'm smiling at everybody.
I'm glad to be home.

200
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,010
It sure is great to be stateside again.
What do you want? A drink?

201
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:33,280
No, no. I got one back there. That how
you hurt your hand, building the bridge?

202
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:42,490
Oh, that. No, that was on the boat coming
back. They were shooting skeet on the boat.

203
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,130
Gun went off by mistake,
and I got a few slugs in my hand.

204
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,300
Poor kid. You know, I like you.
You got a nice face. Poor kid.

205
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,650
- What was the name of the bridge?
- The Burnside Bridge.

206
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,290
- What was the name of the river?
- It wasn't on a river.

207
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,800
It was between two islands. Five miles long.

208
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,330
Nobody ever built a bridge that long.
That's crazy.

209
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,870
- What was the name of the islands?
- Hawaii and Burnside Island.

210
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,940
I never heard of a Burnside Island.
All those islands got Hawaiian names,

211
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:34,280
like Cocowakahiki and stuff like that.
Are you kidding me?

212
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,140
- I said what I said.
- I think you're kidding me.

213
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:42,120
I think you're pulling my leg. Probably got
that hand caught in a wringer or something.

214
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,130
- Hey, where are you going?
- Back where they don't pull my leg.

215
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,630
I should have stayed where I was.

216
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,980
Coming. Coming.

217
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,890
Hello. Who wants him?

218
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,290
Just a minute.

219
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,360
Mr. Miller!

220
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,260
Mr. Miller?

221
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:36,440
Mr. Miller? Mr. Miller?

222
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,940
Mr. Miller, are you in there?

223
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,550
What is it?

224
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:51,920
You're still there. It's the cleaners.
It's late and they want to know if you're sick.

225
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,830
- Are you sick?
- No, no. I'm all right.

226
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,400
I guess I must have overslept.
Tell them I'll be there as quick as I can.

227
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,830
Ain't like you, Mr. Miller.

228
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:55,150
- When did you start keeping bankers hours?
- I overslept.

229
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,750
Listen, Miller, the only one who can
oversleep here is Mr. Alpine.

230
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,130
I don't care which way you cut it,
you're still an errand boy.

231
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,490
- Don't ever forget that.
- It won't happen again.

232
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,120
That's right.

233
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,300
Hey, Eddie. Good thing you came in late.
I got jammed up.

234
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,360
- Here's that special you ordered.
- Swell.

235
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:38,390
Yeah. Yeah. Wait a minute.
I'll write that down. Got it. Thanks.

236
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,370
- Where you been?
- Barber's.

237
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,410
- Yeah, you look neat.
- You don't.

238
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,410
- No, I guess I need a shave.
- What difference does it make?

239
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,000
- You're married.
- My wife is visiting her mother.

240
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,740
- Shave.
- Ballistics just called.

241
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:55,380
That casing you found on the roof,
it's from an M1 carbine.

242
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,850
The cartridge is called a .30 caliber M1.

243
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,790
- That's the only gun it will fit.
- Gives it an Army slant, huh?

244
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,350
Listen, every GI who can
pinches one of these when he gets out.

245
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,890
There must be 10,000 of them
kicking around.

246
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,060
There are also a couple million men
in the Army.

247
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,660
Well, there's one civilian you can scratch,
the guy she had the beef with in the bar.

248
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,100
They found him
in the drunk tank this morning.

249
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:17,900
He was loaded, went on to another joint,
passed out. He's in the clear.

250
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,530
No word from the boyfriend yet.

251
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:22,440
He'll probably turn up
as soon as he reads the papers.

252
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,810
From what I know about musicians,

253
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,010
they're not that neat
when they decide to get rid of their dames.

254
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,950
Look, there's a pile of letters over there
by the phone. Run through them, will you?

255
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,430
- What's all the excitement?
- A girl evidently got killed last night.

256
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,800
That's why all the cops.
A fellow killed her right in the street.

257
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,400
- What fellow?
- They haven't caught him yet.

258
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,000
- It was a fellow, all right.
- Well, you wait.

259
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:00,910
- It will turn out to be her boyfriend.
- Mark my words, it always does.

260
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,470
Yes, it's getting so nowadays
you can't trust these men.

261
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,680
- Yeah.
- It's getting so you can't trust women, either.

262
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,160
Andy Solmes.
Does that name mean anything to you?

263
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,630
Yeah. He owns the Mariposa.
Hey, wait a minute.

264
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,760
Wasn't he picked up about a year ago
on narcotics charges, charges dismissed?

265
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,430
That's the one. His name's in here.
We'll check on him.

266
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:30,740
Hello? No, this is Sergeant Ferris.
Yeah. Yeah. I'll tell him.

267
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,080
Well, it looks like the boyfriend
read the morning papers.

268
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,050
Turned himself in,
and it looks like he's got an alibi.

269
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,090
Figured he would.
Well, we might as well get downtown

270
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,980
and see what he's got to say. Come on.

271
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:44,220
All I know is that we had lunch yesterday.
We were going to go out of town tomorrow.

272
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:48,250
That's all I know.
We didn't fight or anything, honest.

273
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:51,030
- I was going to see her...
- Look, Al,

274
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,760
for the tenth time, get it through your head,
we know you didn't do it.

275
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,900
We've had you checked.
You got an air-tight alibi,

276
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,700
but the fact remains that somebody did it,

277
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,000
and we think that maybe
you can give us a lead.

278
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,600
- Did she know any soldiers? Any officers?
- Not while I knew her. She only seen me.

279
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,580
- Are you sure?
- Why shouldn't I be?

280
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:11,050
- What's soldiers got to do with it?
- How about Solmes?

281
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,610
- How about Andy Solmes?
- Who's he?

282
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,250
- She had his name in her book.
- I don't know him.

283
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,790
- She did.
- Not while I knew her.

284
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,520
She only seen me.

285
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,030
Very well, then,
why were you going out of town?

286
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,310
- Got it. Here you go.
- Thanks, mister.

287
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:12,770
It's all your fault. Why don't you
leave us alone and go play your own game?

288
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:37,290
- Mr. Miller. Awful late for you.
- I ate out. I don't feel very well.

289
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:42,700
Do you hear that, Assa? He don't feel well.
Isn't that too bad?

290
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:49,010
- What's the trouble? Stomach?
- No. No. It's my hand. I burned it cooking.

291
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:55,040
What a shame. Assa, do you see that?
He burned his hand cooking.

292
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,420
I'm trying to get Assa
to catch some mice in the cellar.

293
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,920
He ought to earn his keep
just like all the rest of us.

294
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,050
Shouldn't you, you naughty boy?
You'll have to be careful, Mr. Miller.

295
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:11,500
I do think mothers should teach boys
to cook just as well as girls.

296
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:14,090
My mother never taught me anything.

297
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,830
No, you don't. You've got to work, too.
Everybody's got to work in this world.

298
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:36,620
All right, let's settle down.

299
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:40,690
I suppose you all know
why I've called you in here.

300
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,930
In case you don't...

301
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,670
Pretty, isn't it?

302
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,570
So, that's how it is.

303
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,070
And before we know it,
everybody who's got a telephone

304
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,300
is gonna be on our necks.

305
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:58,440
"What are you doing about it?"
They're gonna ask.

306
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,680
What are you doing about it?
It's a good question.

307
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,840
What are we doing about it?

308
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,920
That's right. Nothing.

309
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,680
And until today,
there wasn't much we could do about it.

310
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,290
I don't expect you to find
a drop of water in a rainstorm.

311
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,990
But this morning, this was brought in.

312
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:28,440
Here's what it says. Quote,

313
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:32,040
"To the police. Stop me.

314
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:38,210
"Find me and stop me.
I'm going to do it again." Unquote.

315
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,760
And it's written on the top of a box
of .30 M1 ammunition,

316
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,420
the same kind that killed
both of these dames.

317
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,930
Where'd it come from?

318
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:51,020
Mailman got it in a box at 7th and Sanes.
Turned it in to the central post office.

319
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,090
- And they brought it down here.
- Any fingerprints?

320
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,690
Thousands. Everybody
except the postmaster general.

321
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:59,210
But at least it shows us
the type of man we're up against.

322
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,830
Now, I don't have to tell you
how much I dislike it.

323
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,400
This guy's probably been
saving up for this for years.

324
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,570
Now we got to get him and get him quick.
If we don't,

325
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,950
every other loopy in town's
gonna jump on the bandwagon,

326
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,990
and we'll find ourselves knee-deep
in a slaughter house.

327
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:14,890
It's happened before, it can happen again.

328
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:22,430
Frank, both of these have been your babies.
Got you up a tree.

329
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:26,230
- Way up on the top branches.
- Well, before you fall out,

330
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,130
check the files for every registered
sex offender of this type.

331
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,370
And pay particular attention to those
who have recently done time.

332
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:35,030
How about checking with the Army
on stolen carbines?

333
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:39,080
Yeah. We can do that, too. Especially in
regards to... What do they call them?

334
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:42,010
Section Eights. I'm checking with the FBI
and the police association

335
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,640
to find out if they've had
any other cases just like this.

336
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,810
Wasn't there a series
in New York like this once?

337
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,080
Maybe. We'll find out.

338
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:50,490
I think there was. They never caught the guy.

339
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,890
- Could be the same one.
- That was a long time ago.

340
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:58,130
All right. All right. So that was New York,
this is here. That's why I've called you in.

341
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:01,260
We've got to do something before we all
find ourselves pounding beats again.

342
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,860
Now, get out and round up
a bunch of these people,

343
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:06,340
rapists, defilers, peeping Toms, etcetera,

344
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,640
everybody we've got
this kind of a record on.

345
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:12,370
Bring them in. Let's talk to them.

346
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:15,280
Find out where they've been,
what they've been doing lately.

347
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:18,810
Let the newspapers know we're not
sitting around with our feet on the desk.

348
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:22,550
If we're in the dark,
it's our business, nobody else's.

349
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,860
- All right, now, get out and earn your money.
- What money?

350
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:39,630
Got them all sorted?

351
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,640
As well as I can. First time I ever did this.

352
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,680
Well, now we'll see what goes.
All right, first three.

353
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,010
Tinman, Eureka, Debiaci.

354
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:55,520
George Tinman, Peter Eureka, Tony Debiaci.
Walk over there and get a spot.

355
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:01,090
Face front. Keep your hands to your sides.

356
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:06,290
All right. Settle down.

357
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,390
Quiet.

358
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:14,710
<i>First man here is George Tinman.</i>
<i>Three charges against him.</i>

359
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:19,580
<i>1946, 1949 and 1950.</i>

360
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,840
<i>What kind of charges, George?</i>

361
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,650
<i>You heard me.</i>

362
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,520
<i>- They said I was looking in their windows.</i>
<i>- They said? Who? The girls?</i>

363
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,780
<i>Looks like they recognized you</i>
<i>all three times.</i>

364
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,420
<i>How could they tell? It was dark.</i>

365
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:39,470
<i>Keep your hands at your side.</i>
<i>What you been doing lately, George?</i>

366
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:41,660
<i>I'm a... I'm a swimming instructor.</i>

367
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,800
<i>Do you take your spy glass</i>
<i>to work with you?</i>

368
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:45,340
<i>No, sir.</i>

369
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,000
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>It would rust underwater, wouldn't it?</i>

370
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,010
<i>How about rifles?</i>
<i>Did you ever shoot fish in a barrel?</i>

371
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,840
<i>I never shot a gun in my life.</i>

372
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:56,780
<i>I'm glad, George. I wouldn't want you</i>
<i>to get into any bad habits.</i>

373
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,380
<i>Second man is Peter Eureka.</i>

374
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,190
<i>Peter's a letter writer.</i>
<i>Not a very nice one, either.</i>

375
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,790
<i>He writes to strange women, and</i>
<i>he's frightened a lot of them pretty badly.</i>

376
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:10,660
<i>How about that, Pete, don't you like women?</i>
<i>Never been married?</i>

377
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:13,290
<i>- Three times.</i>
<i>- Three times.</i>

378
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,000
<i>Why'd all these happy homes break up?</i>

379
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:17,730
<i>Did you spend all your wives'</i>
<i>household money for stamps?</i>

380
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:22,900
<i>- I did the breaking up.</i>
<i>- Yeah. I guess you probably did.</i>

381
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:26,240
<i>You know, Pete, I read somewhere</i>
<i>that the pen is mightier than the sword.</i>

382
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:29,810
<i>- How about that? Did you ever try a sword?</i>
<i>- I never had a sword.</i>

383
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,550
<i>What about a rifle? I guess maybe</i>
<i>you thought a rifle was the best thing of all.</i>

384
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:38,250
<i>- I never shot anybody.</i>
<i>- Not even maybe an odd wife or two?</i>

385
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:39,520
<i>I never shot anybody.</i>

386
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,590
<i>And what about Eureka?</i>
<i>What does that mean?</i>

387
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:46,290
<i>Every day I hear somebody yell, "Eureka!"</i>
<i>They talking about you, Pete?</i>

388
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,990
<i>I don't know what it means.</i>

389
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:50,770
<i>That's too bad.</i>
<i>I thought I was gonna get to find out.</i>

390
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,030
You're wasting your time, Andy.
It's none of these men.

391
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:56,040
- There's a lot more coming.
- It won't be any of those, either.

392
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:59,240
You're the police psychiatrist.
Suppose you turn up the guy we want.

393
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,410
What makes you so sure, Doctor?

394
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,610
- It's my job.
- And this is ours.

395
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:06,420
<i>Next man is Anthony Debiaci.</i>

396
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,220
<i>Ant, put your hands at your side</i>
<i>and keep them there.</i>

397
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,690
<i>Anthony Debiaci.</i>
<i>Tony's a rapist, two-time loser.</i>

398
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,630
<i>We had him in last week on the same charge</i>
<i>and couldn't make it stick.</i>

399
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:21,400
<i>That woman just picked me out.</i>
<i>I never saw her before.</i>

400
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:24,870
<i>Still saying it, huh, Tony?</i>
<i>Well, maybe she did make a mistake.</i>

401
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,410
<i>Soured you on women.</i>

402
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,670
<i>Turned you into a real killer.</i>
<i>Is that what it did?</i>

403
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:33,040
<i>- You can't pin anything on me this time.</i>
<i>- Not even a rose?</i>

404
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:37,240
<i>What a shame.</i>
<i>What have you been doing lately, Tony?</i>

405
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,520
<i>- Minding my own business.</i>
<i>- What business is that?</i>

406
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:45,420
<i>- I got a job. I make deliveries.</i>
<i>- Get you into a lot of houses?</i>

407
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:46,790
<i>I do my job.</i>

408
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:51,300
<i>Yeah, I'll bet you do.</i>
<i>All right, you three can go now.</i>

409
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:53,760
- I'll see you later, Andy.
- Leaving already?

410
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:58,070
- We got a dozen more to run through.
- You still won't find the man you want.

411
00:47:58,170 --> 00:47:59,900
See you, Captain.

412
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,570
- He's a great help.
- Keep your shirt on. He knows his job.

413
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,740
Yeah, but does he know ours?

414
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:08,750
<i>Next is Dan Wormel.</i>
<i>Dan's a tough guy with small animals.</i>

415
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:15,250
- Kafka?
- Hello, Doc.

416
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,620
- Meeting somebody?
- No.

417
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:18,390
- Come on, sit down.
- Thank you.

418
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,260
- Hello, Lieutenant.
- Hiya, Tom.

419
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,920
- Get me an order of tomato beef, will you?
- Sure thing.

420
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,360
Dig in.

421
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:28,890
- I didn't know you liked Chinese food.
- It's good and it's cheap.

422
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:31,030
They're not breaking their arms
paying us, you know.

423
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,630
You can say that again.

424
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:36,770
Me, I just happen to like it.
Been eating it ever since I can remember.

425
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,310
It's funny I've never seen you in here.

426
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,440
Well, I eat here a lot,
but half the time I'm out in left field.

427
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,450
- Find your man in the show up?
- Are you kidding?

428
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,950
Just asking.

429
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,390
You know,
this sniper thing is driving me crazy.

430
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:52,550
There's some things I understand
and some things I don't.

431
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:55,320
If a guy blows his top
and sticks a knife into somebody,

432
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,190
on the spur of the moment, that is,

433
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,170
I understand it, so does the law.
It's second degree.

434
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,730
And if a guy decides to knock off his wife
and spend six months

435
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:07,000
figuring out how to do it,
I understand that, too.

436
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:08,700
That's first degree.

437
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,540
- But this thing I don't get.
- You will.

438
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:13,910
- Will what?
- Get him.

439
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,110
Sure. After he's shot down 30 or 40 dames.

440
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:21,120
- By that time, I'll be back pounding a beat.
- No, it won't take that long.

441
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:22,850
Though I'll tell you one thing.

442
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,980
You won't get him by running show ups
like the one I saw.

443
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,930
Look, Doc, those show ups
pay off more than you think.

444
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,560
Not in a case like this.

445
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:34,930
Look, Kafka, let me tell you something
about these people.

446
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,990
Anderson calls them nuts.

447
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:39,770
Psychiatrists use $10 words,
but whatever you call them,

448
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,740
they run to a pattern and they don't overlap.

449
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:47,300
They're all in...
In little water-tight compartments.

450
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,410
Well, so are most criminals, for that matter.

451
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,450
If you have an armed robbery, you don't
waste time rounding up pickpockets.

452
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,750
- Sure. That's right.
- It's the same thing in this case.

453
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:59,020
Now, you had a peeping Tom
in the show up.

454
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:02,720
All right. Now peeping Toms
don't kill women. They stick to peeping.

455
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:08,290
Rapists don't write poison pen letters.
Obscene letter writers don't commit rape.

456
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:13,240
All criminal types and especially
sex offenders stay in their own grooves.

457
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,900
So, if you keep dragging
everyone in the book into a show up,

458
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:20,570
- you're just wasting your time.
- Okay. What type are we gonna look for?

459
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:24,380
I'd look for somebody who's been getting
tough with women from the very beginning.

460
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:28,080
Maybe he started small, slugging them
on a dark street or something like that.

461
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,280
But whatever he did,
it'd be a crime of violence.

462
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,720
- That you can be sure of.
- Cute kid.

463
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:35,130
- Very.
- How'd he get that way?

464
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,860
Could be one of a thousand reasons.

465
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:42,390
Maybe some woman did something mean
to him when he was a kid.

466
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:47,130
He may not even remember what it was,
but something in here remembers.

467
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,200
Perhaps it was his mother.
Usually is in these cases.

468
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,150
Whoever it was, it was probably
a brunette in her late 20s.

469
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:55,180
Of course, it doesn't matter now.

470
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:58,740
He's past the stage
where he could have been talked out of it.

471
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:02,850
And whoever it was,
he's killing her over and over again.

472
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,190
What's the matter?

473
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,130
I guess I better stick to a fork.

474
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:13,790
He's killing her over and over again.

475
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,230
He's been doing it in his mind for years.

476
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:19,500
Now that he started doing it for real,
he's gonna keep right on doing it.

477
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:23,310
- For how long?
- As long as he doesn't get caught.

478
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,470
And as long as his cartridges last.

479
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:31,480
<i>Nelson is running to third.</i>
<i>The ball bounces off the left-field wall.</i>

480
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:34,990
<i>A quick pick up, but Nelson is streaking</i>
<i>for home plate. He's safe.</i>

481
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:38,120
<i>Jackson holds it up at second.</i>
<i>What a ball game this is!</i>

482
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:44,290
<i>And you say this will be a costume ball,</i>
<i>Mrs. Fitzpatrick? What will the motif be?</i>

483
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:49,430
<i>Well, it's American history, but before 1900.</i>
<i>No costume after 1900.</i>

484
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,940
<i>That sounds wonderful.</i>
<i>Will it include Indians?</i>

485
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:57,440
<i>I hope it will include hundreds of Indians.</i>

486
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:01,610
<i>- I love Indians, too.</i>
<i>- After all, Indians are part of our history, too.</i>

487
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:05,980
<i>Indeed they are,</i>
<i>and a very important part, too.</i>

488
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:10,490
<i>Well, tell me, Mrs. Fitzpatrick,</i>
<i>where will the public be able to buy tickets</i>

489
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,820
<i>for this charity ball given for the benefit</i>
<i>of Saint Stephen's Hospital Guild?</i>

490
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,960
<i>Well, they can buy them</i>
<i>at the Women's Civic League.</i>

491
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:21,230
<i>Or those wishing to come</i>
<i>can write me directly at my home.</i>

492
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:26,400
<i>It's 380 Kendel Drive. They're $10 apiece,</i>

493
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:31,340
<i>and we just hope that everybody</i>
<i>who can come will come.</i>

494
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:33,140
<i>I'm sure they will.</i>

495
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:35,710
<i>Well, thank you so much,</i>
<i>Mrs. Warren Fitzpatrick,</i>

496
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:40,950
<i>for this clear picture of the activities</i>
<i>of the Women's Civic League.</i>

497
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:45,760
Now, look. You can't block the door like that.
People want to come in and out.

498
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,760
I wish I talked to Dr. Kent before.

499
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:55,170
Might have saved us a lot of time
and a lot of trouble.

500
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,470
- We've still got a lot of trouble.
- Come on. Come on.

501
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:00,970
We're a lot further along.
We know one thing.

502
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:05,500
These psychiatric offenders don't overlap.

503
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,810
Get him. Okay, so they don't overlap,

504
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,080
- but we still got a lot of them.
- What's the matter with you?

505
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:11,450
- You had a fight with your girl?
- Yeah.

506
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,960
She doesn't like the kind of hours
I've been keeping lately.

507
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:18,480
Hey, here's one that might fit the pattern.
He's out on parole now.

508
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:22,960
He's had one, two, three, six convictions.

509
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:25,100
Likes to use a club.

510
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,500
Six convictions? That probably means
he's gotten away with 12 others.

511
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:31,400
Man, you're just overflowing
with information tonight.

512
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:33,300
I sure am.

513
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:37,780
Here's a guy who had his first conviction for
cracking a girl's skull with a baseball bat.

514
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,380
She must have struck him out
and he got mad.

515
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,310
What'd he do then?
Go on to bigger and better things?

516
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:45,010
That's right. Bigger and better things.

517
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,520
Three suspicions of assaults against women.

518
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,390
One assault where
there was no suspicion at all.

519
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:53,450
He got an 18-month stretch for that one.
I think we'll look into Mr. Miller.

520
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,050
- Tom Kafka?
- Yeah.

521
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:57,290
Just came over the Teletype.
They want you out there.

522
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,300
- Out where?
- 380 Kendel Drive.

523
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:02,100
There's been another murder.
Looks like the sniper again.

524
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:03,830
- What's the name?
- Warren Fitzpatrick.

525
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,840
It was Mrs. Fitzpatrick that was killed.

526
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,170
Warren Fitzpatrick?
That will blow the lid off.

527
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,640
What do you mean will blow the lid off?
It's already blown it.

528
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:14,150
Come on, let's go.

529
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,110
- What's going on?
- They killed someone.

530
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:20,710
- Where?
- In that driveway over there.

531
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,560
The nurse was down in the kitchen
getting herself a glass of milk

532
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:25,060
when she heard the shot.

533
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:26,680
She called us right after.

534
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,990
There's a chance
we might nail the guy this time.

535
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,760
The section's full of prowl cars.

536
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:33,130
We know. We saw half a dozen of them
on the way up here.

537
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,330
- You know what this will mean?
- Let's not talk about it.

538
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,530
- I wouldn't want to be in your shoes.
- They'd hurt your feet anyway.

539
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,700
- Where's her husband?
- Fitzpatrick? Beats me.

540
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:46,240
Downtown somewheres.
They're trying to find him.

541
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:48,280
This looks like him now.

542
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:13,100
- Where are the children?
- Upstairs, Mr. Fitzpatrick. They're asleep.

543
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,100
How long is it going on?
What are you doing about it?

544
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:23,410
We're doing everything we can,
Mr. Fitzpatrick. I'm very sorry.

545
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:27,390
What are you doing about it?
What are you going to do about it?

546
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:36,460
Listen, the whole city's gone crazy.

547
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:40,490
I come to work this morning on the streetcar
and everybody's reading the newspaper,

548
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:43,900
all about the sniper, even talking about it,

549
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:46,910
you know, people who never
talk to each other any other time.

550
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:50,670
Yeah. I leave my joint this morning,
I hear my wife lock the door.

551
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:54,700
She never locked the door before.
She's one scared dame.

552
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:58,220
- How about you? You scared?
- For her or for me?

553
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,220
For her.
He's just killing dames, the paper says.

554
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,950
So this week he's killing dames,

555
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:07,550
so next week it's guys with one leg
or false teeth or something.

556
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,320
Or maybe guys who work in cleaning plants.

557
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,660
You better stay home nights, Joey.
Maybe he's got his eye on you.

558
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:16,000
No, just dames, the paper says.

559
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:17,370
Listen, if he wants to get in touch with me,

560
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,370
I'll give him the addresses of two,
maybe three.

561
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,970
- Dames never done me any good.
- You should have heard my wife at breakfast.

562
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,140
Why, you'd think she'd expect me
to go out and catch him myself.

563
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:30,270
Somebody better catch him.
Cops ain't doing any good.

564
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:34,250
There's an editorial in the paper.
Papers are plenty sore at the cops.

565
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,810
Papers! What do they know?

566
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:38,950
Scream till they get the guy
and then when they have the trial,

567
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:42,830
why, they cry in their beer because
the guy's probably innocent after all.

568
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,160
Take a dame that's on trial for murder.
Unless she's got two heads,

569
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:48,200
why, they think she's beautiful.

570
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:52,140
If I get my hands on the guy,
they wouldn't have to worry about no trial.

571
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:55,770
- Yeah? What would you do to him?
- He wouldn't die quick, I'll tell you that.

572
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,940
Mr. Lydell, I'm sure no one
regrets any more than I do

573
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,780
the outrages perpetrated on these women.

574
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:04,680
Mrs. Fitzpatrick, in particular,
was a very good friend of mine...

575
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,480
Mr. Mayor, this isn't a personal matter.

576
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:10,680
The people of this city are alarmed
and frightened.

577
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,160
There's a maniac loose
and the police seem helpless.

578
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,590
That's why we've asked for this conference.

579
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:19,390
We want to know why such
a state of affairs can continue.

580
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,460
Chief?

581
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:24,990
As far as the people
being frightened goes, Mr. Lydell,

582
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:27,010
maybe your newspaper
has something to do with it.

583
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:29,630
My newspaper merely reports the news.
It doesn't make it.

584
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:33,110
It slants the news. It exploits hysteria.

585
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:36,240
That doesn't solve your problem.
You still haven't caught the man.

586
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,310
Most killers are caught because of motive.
There's no motive here.

587
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:41,290
Murder itself can be a motive.

588
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,920
We're short foot patrolmen, Mr. Harper.

589
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:47,260
If you want to volunteer,
I'm sure we can find a place for you.

590
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:50,790
I'm efficient at my job.
Evidently your men aren't efficient at theirs.

591
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,420
I agree. The police have shown themselves
unimaginative and...

592
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:57,270
- Now, hold on, Mr. Weiss...
- Just a moment, gentlemen.

593
00:57:57,370 --> 00:58:00,600
Mr. Weiss, I'm not trying
to defend my administration,

594
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,630
but I seem to remember
that two years ago when we tried

595
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:07,740
to get the police budget increased,
your group fought us tooth and nail.

596
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,370
Taxes are high enough as it is.

597
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:13,610
And as far as that goes, we're getting
very little value for the taxes we do pay.

598
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:19,280
Mr. Lydell, please. I think we're
going at this thing like little children.

599
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,800
Lieutenant Kafka here has been on the case
since the beginning.

600
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,330
Perhaps, if we can continue
meeting reasonably,

601
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,920
with his giving us a sketch
of what has happened to date, we might...

602
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,490
We know what's happened up to date.

603
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:34,030
What we want to know is
what's going to happen from now on.

604
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,600
We want this man caught and caught quick.

605
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,700
And punished. Punished. Punished.

606
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:45,610
Well, if everyone's going to sound off,
I guess I might as well get in the act.

607
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:48,310
You mention punishment, Mr. Lydell.

608
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:50,320
Just what sort of punishment
did you have in mind?

609
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:53,330
The sort the man's crimes deserve.

610
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:55,490
He ought to be killed
the way a mad dog is killed.

611
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,590
- That's right.
- Absolutely.

612
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,160
Or put in the insane asylum.

613
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,560
Do you know the legal definition of insanity?

614
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,870
- No.
- I'll tell you.

615
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:07,370
It's based on an old English law,

616
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,810
a law passed
when they were still burning witches.

617
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,610
An insane person, according to the law,

618
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,610
must not be able to tell the difference
between right and wrong.

619
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,980
Well, obviously, this man doesn't know
the difference between right and wrong.

620
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:21,420
Don't be too sure of that.

621
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:24,980
You see, Mr. Stonecroft, there are
hundreds of thousands of sex offenders

622
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:30,290
walking American streets at this moment
who could be the sniper or worse.

623
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:33,930
But only 1% of them are legally insane.

624
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,200
1%, Mr. Stonecroft.
Now what will we do with the other 99?

625
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:41,800
Never mind the other 99.
Let's get back to the matter in hand.

626
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,500
- The madman who's loose with a rifle.
- Carbine.

627
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:47,210
Get back to him, Mr. Lydell?
I've never left him.

628
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,840
And I'll tell you something.

629
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:53,150
When this man is caught, you'll find he has
a record dating back to when he was a kid.

630
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,420
Believe me,
he's been in the hands of the police before.

631
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:58,620
Thirty days for one thing,
60 days for another.

632
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:00,520
And I'll tell you something else.

633
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:02,930
If his first act had led to treatment
instead of jail,

634
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,620
three women wouldn't be lying dead today.

635
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,130
The fact remains
three women are lying dead today.

636
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,800
- And the killer's still loose.
- Yes, loose because of us.

637
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:12,500
And a killer because of us.

638
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:15,630
And the horrible thing about it is
we may be sitting here six months from now

639
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:19,150
or three months from now
on another case just like it.

640
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:22,550
Gentlemen, the city is frightened,

641
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:23,640
and when cities get frightened,

642
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:28,590
they rear up on their hind legs
and strike out at something, anything.

643
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:31,950
This time we have a chance not to strike out
blindly, but to act with reason.

644
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:34,320
This time we can do something.

645
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:38,460
You all have weight and power,
not only in the city, but in the state.

646
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:41,430
Put your weight behind
getting a new law passed.

647
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,470
Let every socially dangerous sex offender,

648
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:48,470
as soon as he is caught for his first offense,
be committed to a mental institution,

649
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:51,510
and there he can be cured
or put away indefinitely.

650
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,770
- I think...
- What is this you think?

651
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,580
Who cares what you think?

652
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:57,640
The important thing to think about
is three dead women,

653
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:59,240
not coddling the man who killed them.

654
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:03,150
Look, I'm thinking of the hundreds of women
who will be dead if something isn't done.

655
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:08,350
Now, listen, Mr. Harper, just...
Just let me give you an example.

656
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:10,900
A few years ago a man named Albert Fish

657
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,230
was executed in New York
for the murder of a child.

658
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,790
A judge of the state supreme court
estimated that this man

659
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:21,270
had undoubtedly killed at least 15 others.

660
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:25,330
Now, he was executed for one,
but 16 were dead.

661
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:27,740
And this is not an isolated case.
It happens everywhere.

662
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:31,550
Perhaps not every day,
but much, much too often.

663
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:33,880
So, I repeat, pass a law.

664
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:37,010
Put these people away
when they're first caught.

665
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:39,920
And those who can be cured, will be cured.

666
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:45,120
And those who can't, well,
at least they'll never get out to try it again.

667
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,360
If you can get a law like this passed,

668
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:50,130
you could start a ball rolling
all across this country.

669
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:54,570
Get a law like that passed
and this meeting could be a milestone.

670
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,440
Where's the money coming from
for an institution like that?

671
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:59,030
Taxes.

672
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:03,980
- Well, that would have to be a state matter.
- I can hear the governor screaming already.

673
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:05,480
When I saw Dr. Kent come in,

674
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:09,510
I had a feeling this meeting would eventually
come down to psychiatric mumbo jumbo,

675
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:13,080
and I wasn't wrong. It has.

676
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,820
So we're right back where we started.

677
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,560
There's a crazy man loose in the streets

678
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:22,260
and the police are too busy
passing the buck to catch him.

679
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:26,140
Well, Mr. Mayor and Mr. Chief of Police

680
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:32,910
and Mr. Psychiatrist, let this sink in.

681
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:35,210
Unless he's caught very, very soon,

682
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:40,550
this administration is going to find itself
shaken right off its foundations.

683
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:43,520
Planning to make a political football
out of it?

684
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:45,490
Call it anything you like.

685
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,650
Gentlemen, thank you
for giving us your time.

686
01:02:55,670 --> 01:03:00,700
Well, it's still sitting right in my lap,
and all I have to do is catch him.

687
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:06,940
Sure. You'll catch him and they'll kill him
and everybody will forget about it.

688
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:09,950
That is, until the next one comes along,

689
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,750
and it'll start all over again.

690
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:41,970
- Where'd he go?
- Back this way.

691
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:49,910
Drop that gun. Make sure I hear it hit.

692
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:00,620
I ought to beat your brains out.

693
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,440
What's the matter with you, Rivers?
This gun hasn't been fired in years.

694
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:14,100
The hammer doesn't work,
and there's no firing pin.

695
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:17,540
Look, Lieutenant, the way things are today,
you jump first, then ask the questions.

696
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:19,840
I saw the gun, I brought him in.

697
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:23,080
- Where'd you get this, son?
- It used to belong to my father.

698
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:25,710
- What were you doing up on the roof?
- Nothing.

699
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:28,150
Well, you were up there pointing this.
You think that's nothing?

700
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:32,350
- I didn't hurt anybody.
- No, and you're not going to.

701
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:35,660
Okay, Rivers, take him out and let him go.

702
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:38,660
If your father wants his gun,
you tell him it's down here.

703
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:42,070
Go ahead and keep the gun.
You think I care about the gun?

704
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:45,230
I know where there's plenty of guns
and plenty of bullets, too.

705
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:47,970
You think there's only one guy
in this town that doesn't like people?

706
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,370
There's millions of them,
and I know who they are.

707
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,740
They can get me
all the guns and bullets I want.

708
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:54,910
You can't kick me around...

709
01:05:57,850 --> 01:06:01,010
Take him over to the city hospital
and see what they think in the psycho ward.

710
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,080
- But you just said...
- It doesn't matter what I just said.

711
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,750
What does matter is
that I just got an idea about him.

712
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:09,090
I don't want to be looking for him
in a couple of years when he's got a real gun

713
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,650
or maybe an ax. Go ahead.

714
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:27,740
- Gonna have a nice weekend, Miller?
- Yeah, I guess so. I don't know.

715
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:30,840
I want you to do something for me
before you come back on Monday.

716
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,150
- Think you can?
- What?

717
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:34,980
Change that bandage.

718
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:40,520
- I can't change it.
- Then find someone who can. It's filthy.

719
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:44,030
We can't have our drivers going around
with things like that on their hands.

720
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,000
I don't want to see it on your hand Monday.

721
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,050
This way, Lieutenant.

722
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,570
- Is it the sniper?
- Sure, it's the sniper.

723
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:24,260
- One side, please. Let us through.
- Hey, how many does that make, four?

724
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:26,670
Why don't you do something?
Earn your money.

725
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:29,710
They're always there after it happens.

726
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:32,470
Getting so you can't even go to a park
on a Sunday.

727
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:34,380
Some police force.

728
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:37,880
- How long ago did it happen?
- About 15 minutes ago.

729
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:40,980
- You got here fast enough.
- Where did the shot come from?

730
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:42,540
Where did the shot come from?

731
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:48,790
I don't know. We were just walking, and
she said, "Let's sit down," and she sat down

732
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:50,260
and I was about to sit down myself when...

733
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:51,890
Look around, Joe,
and see what you can find.

734
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:53,300
Right.

735
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:57,030
Can you think of anybody
that you've had any trouble with lately?

736
01:07:57,140 --> 01:08:02,340
- Anybody mad at her?
- No. She got along fine with everybody.

737
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:06,440
I never seen her fight with anyone,
except me once in a while.

738
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:08,980
Everybody liked Sandy.

739
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:12,420
- Hey, I found the shell.
- Put that down, you idiot!

740
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:13,750
What's the matter with you? You crazy?

741
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:15,910
- Sorry, I forgot.
- You forgot...

742
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:16,940
Hey. Be careful.

743
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:46,670
I know a 10-year-old kid who can do
better than that with his left hand.

744
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:50,980
If they're all like you,
I might just as well go to sleep.

745
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:57,250
Three balls for nine. Nine for a quarter.
Let's see you knock her in the water.

746
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:00,990
Say, you look like a pitcher.
How about you there?

747
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:02,320
Nine. Nine it is.

748
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,960
Hey, Don, he looks like a pitcher,
an empty pitcher.

749
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:13,360
- Yep, I might just as well go to sleep.
- Maybe you need a basketball, Mac.

750
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:17,230
He's pitching for...

751
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:21,040
Pretty lucky.

752
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:36,260
Offhand I can think of three ball clubs
that can use this guy.

753
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:03,120
Did you ever see anything like that?

754
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,510
Are you sure, Doctor?

755
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:08,560
Nobody with a burned hand, say,
in the past two weeks?

756
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:12,090
Not even a woman? I see.

757
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:15,690
Well, thank you, Doctor. I'm sorry to have
disturbed you at this hour of the night.

758
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:20,000
Goodbye. Oh, boy,
how many does that make?

759
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:21,630
I don't know. I lost count.

760
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:25,670
Well, the next one's Shipley.
Harold Shipley. Eldemont Fall, 1919.

761
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,140
You take over for a while.

762
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:32,620
I'll be talking to doctors in my sleep.
Not that I'll be getting any sleep.

763
01:11:32,690 --> 01:11:35,120
- Teletypes, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.

764
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:51,630
Hello, can I talk to Dr. Shipley, please?
Sergeant Ferris, Homicide.

765
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:55,540
Police Department. What?

766
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:59,370
I'm sorry to hear that.
Who's handling his practice?

767
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:02,510
Yeah, I see.

768
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:04,920
Well, thanks very much.
I'm sorry I disturbed you.

769
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:08,420
Dr. Shipley's been sick himself for months.

770
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:13,620
Dr. Holiday is handling his practice,
and we have talked to Dr. Holiday.

771
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:16,820
- Anything in the Teletypes?
- No. Just the usual.

772
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,630
Somebody had a target in his backyard.

773
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:21,500
Some dame thinks
the sniper's been spying on her.

774
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:24,130
Some other dame says a guy's been
throwing baseballs at her,

775
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:28,140
which is funny because that's her job,
having baseballs thrown at her.

776
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:32,370
Some man wants us to... Baseballs?

777
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,870
- Where you going?
- File room.

778
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:48,820
Homicide. Sergeant Ferris. Hiya, Scott.
Where are you?

779
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:51,760
What? No kidding.

780
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:54,360
Hey, that's great. Yeah, we'll be right over.

781
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:06,570
Hey, Frank, they found out
where they put on the bandage.

782
01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:09,170
- No kidding.
- That's what I said. Come on, huh?

783
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:10,240
What have you got there?

784
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,380
I don't know yet, but maybe
it's the guy they put the bandage on.

785
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:17,160
That's the one. That's not the name he gave.

786
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:20,090
- Burnside he called himself.
- He called himself Edward, though.

787
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,920
- How about the address?
- That will be a phony.

788
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,430
And the one under the name of Miller
will be out of date.

789
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,130
He's probably moved five times
since he registered.

790
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,800
- How did he act when he was here?
- As I remember, sort of strange.

791
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:35,170
I tried to talk, you know, cheerfully,
but he wasn't buying any.

792
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:37,570
We thought of sending him up to Psycho,
but something came up...

793
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:42,550
- There was a very bad accident case came in.
- That's right. That's what it was.

794
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:46,610
Wait a minute. There was something
he said to me at the end.

795
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:50,320
He said... What was it?

796
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:54,790
Yes. He said, "Don't you think
this is a funny way to get hurt?"

797
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:59,700
Or something like that.
I was so busy, I didn't pay any attention.

798
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:02,960
I guess maybe he wanted to stop himself.

799
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:07,600
Maybe he wanted to stop himself for years.
Maybe nobody else paid any attention either.

800
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:17,710
They better get this nut.

801
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:19,810
Next thing you know
he'll be coming right into your house.

802
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:24,880
- I think it's horrible. Who'd he kill this time?
- Girl walking in the park with her boyfriend.

803
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,830
But he left a bandage behind him.
Maybe that's clue enough for them.

804
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:30,490
I certainly hope so.

805
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,190
Wherever you go these days
that's all people talk about.

806
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:35,170
You can say that again.

807
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:40,000
Did you say a bandage?

808
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:42,870
Yeah. They found it on a bush
right by the cartridge case.

809
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:46,840
- What kind of a bandage?
- Wait a minute.

810
01:14:46,910 --> 01:14:48,640
Yeah, here it is.

811
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:53,850
"Police laboratory technicians report that
the bandage is from a man's right hand,

812
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,010
"evidently covering a bad burn. They also..."

813
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,600
Operator, give me
the police department, please.

814
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:19,910
- Are you sure you got the place surrounded?
- He can get in, but he won't get out.

815
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:22,210
- Is he often late?
- Is he?

816
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:25,110
Maybe three times
in the last couple of weeks, Mr. Alpine.

817
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:26,650
But I warned him. I told him if it happened...

818
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,880
- Do you know his number?
- Yes, I know it.

819
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,750
Call his place
and see if he's left for work yet.

820
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:32,690
- Yes, sir.
- Tell me, Lieutenant,

821
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,280
do you think you can keep the name
of the establishment out of this?

822
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,920
It will be very bad for business, very bad.

823
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,430
Don't talk to me about that, Mr. Alpine.
Talk to the reporters.

824
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,490
There must be some way...

825
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:45,090
Hello, this is the Alpine Cleaners and Dyers.
Has Eddie Miller left for work yet?

826
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:49,300
What? I see. Thank you.

827
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:52,000
He left half an hour ago.
He ought to be here by now.

828
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:55,840
- How many men you got out there, Joe?
- I don't know. Maybe 15, 20.

829
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,110
Where is he? Why isn't he here?
What's keeping him this time?

830
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:38,120
Marsha, wait a minute.

831
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:12,660
Hey, the sniper! Hey, the sniper!

832
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:18,560
Hey! Hey, over there! The sniper! Hey! Hey!

833
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:22,000
Over there! The sniper! The sniper!

834
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:28,340
He's got a gun! Look out! The sniper!
Look out! Hey!

835
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:30,380
Hey! Somebody look!

836
01:17:34,710 --> 01:17:39,780
Hey, look! Up here! Hey, the sniper!
Here on the roof!

837
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:43,380
Why did you have to do that?
I didn't kill her.

838
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:47,620
You can see I didn't kill her.
Why do you have to yell like that?

839
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:48,990
Hey!

840
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,200
<i>... and requests that any citizen</i>
<i>who knows of any man</i>

841
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:27,580
<i>who has had a badly burned right hand</i>
<i>within the past two weeks</i>

842
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:31,610
<i>to report him to the police immediately.</i>
<i>He may be the sniper.</i>

843
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:36,210
<i>I repeat, he may be the sniper.</i>
<i>We know that this man...</i>

844
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:40,250
Burned hands, snipers,
I don't know what the world's coming to.

845
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:42,260
Do you, Assa?

846
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:47,630
Why, Mr. Miller,
what brings you home from work at this...

847
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:03,560
- You can't go down there.
- Well, we want to see what's going on.

848
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:06,130
- There's nothing to see.
- Come on, handsome.

849
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:07,670
You heard me.

850
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:18,810
- What's up? What's going on?
- Nothing we need you for. Stay back.

851
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,410
They got the sniper up there.
He lives up this street.

852
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:22,480
I hope they kill him.

853
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:26,180
Get somebody into that school up there.
Tell them to keep those kids inside.

854
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:27,320
Right.

855
01:24:27,390 --> 01:24:29,360
- Hi, Frank. Where you been?
- Scene of the crime.

856
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:32,020
- Looks like we missed it.
- Yeah. Well, we won't miss him this time.

857
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:33,500
Which house?

858
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:42,070
That one with the shades drawn.
He's holed up in his room there.

859
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:44,630
You know, some solid citizens
are gonna get their brains blown out

860
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:45,840
if they don't pull their heads in.

861
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:48,710
- Not that they got any brains to begin with.
- Why don't you tell them?

862
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:50,510
I'm waiting for the sound truck.

863
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:52,240
Have you sent any of our men
into the house?

864
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:55,290
- No. I figure on using tear gas.
- I'll go in.

865
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:57,080
- Don't be foolish, Frank.
- Why not?

866
01:24:57,190 --> 01:24:58,850

All right, Eddie, let's go.
