1
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:02,007
Well, what I want to know, honey,
is what are you gonna do now?

2
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:06,876
I'm gonna be happy for a change.
After all, he ain't the only man in the world.

3
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:10,040
There's plenty of good fish in the sea,
I always say.

4
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:13,279
Besides, I was getting kind of sick of him.
It's time I run into somebody new.

5
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:28,729
- I want to go home. I want to go home.
- You always want to go home.

6
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,168
Say, why don't you watch
where you're going?

7
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,939
You might have hurt this lady.

8
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,503
Come on. Young fool.

9
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,690
- Glad you liked it.
- Do you work every day?

10
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,791
- Sure.
- Be here tomorrow?

11
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,530
- Of course. Always.
- Good night, then.

12
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,696
Good night, Millie.

13
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,836
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

14
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,577
I want to get the state prison at Huntsburg.
No. No. I don't know the number.

15
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,116
- She always drink two malts?
- Oh, let her. It's good for business.

16
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,521
- Your business. Monkey business.
- What?

17
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:02,890
- Sandy, what's the matter?
- Just a minute.

18
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:13,235
- Can I have some change, please?
- Why, certainly.

19
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,456
- All right.
- Sandy, I didn't do anything.

20
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,620
- Not yet you didn't do anything.
- I was just waiting...

21
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:41,929
Hello, this is Mr. Edward Miller.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Gillette, please.

22
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,763
It's very important.

23
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,564
What?

24
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,200
Two weeks? Well, what's his number there?

25
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,180
But I've got to reach him. I told you,
it's very important. It's a matter of life or...

26
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,678
Well, listen.
There must be a phone near where he is.

27
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,788
Well, can't you...
Well, can you please tell me if...

28
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:19,762
All right. All right. All right!

29
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,316
I guess, I do. But you make me so mad.

30
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,214
- Did you get your party?
- Didn't get his party.

31
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,859
Do you know how much coffee
I've had today? Seventeen cups.

32
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,262
The Brazilians ought to give me a medal.
What is it?

33
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:56,358
Second-degree burns.
Chadwick's in with him.

34
00:08:56,435 --> 00:09:01,771
- Here's his card.
- Edward Burnside. Well, the name fits.

35
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,670
Right hand. Electric stove.

36
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,578
Yeah, friend, a man's got no business
fooling around with stoves.

37
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,745
They're strictly a woman's business.
You're not married?

38
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:17,084
- No.
- You're missing a big deal, friend.

39
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:20,249
So you get married.
So your wife does all the cooking.

40
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,918
So she's the one that gets burned.
So what happens?

41
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,488
So she comes and cries on your shoulder,

42
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,627
and you pat her head
and give her a kiss or two.

43
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:34,002
Yeah, that's living. Keep your hand still.

44
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,702
Next day she tells you to climb on a ladder
and clean out the closet,

45
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:42,304
and you fall and break a leg. I don't know.
They got you coming and going.

46
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,009
- Everything all right?
- Just finished.

47
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:50,282
You'll have to sign this, Mr. Burnside.
Your left hand will do.

48
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,156
- Can I see you a minute outside, Chad?
- Sure.

49
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,992
You notice anything funny about...

50
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,970
Outside of the fact that
he did it on purpose, no.

51
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:09,303
- You think it was self-inflicted?
- Look, to get a second degree like that,

52
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,742
he'd have had to hold his hand on a burner
a couple of seconds, at least.

53
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,803
Sure it was self-inflicted.

54
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,809
Give me a minute, will you?

55
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:30,592
Mr. Burnside, I want to ask you a question.
Were you ever in a mental hospital?

56
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,931
- Only when I was imprisoned.
- Prison?

57
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:43,135
- In the psycho ward. But they let me go.
- Why?

58
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:50,015
My sentence was up. Dr. Gillette wanted
to keep me, but they let me go.

59
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,812
- What'd you go up for?
- I...

60
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,847
I hit someone, a girl.

61
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,191
- Why?
- I don't know.

62
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:08,593
- How do you feel now?
- Not right. I don't feel right.

63
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,560
You gonna keep me here?

64
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:15,164
I don't know.
Stay where you are for a minute, will you?

65
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,441
- Well?
- I'm gonna send him upstairs.

66
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,711
- You crazy?
- Not as crazy as he is.

67
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:29,448
He'll make five loopies you've sent
up in the past two weeks.

68
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,082
- Where are the rest of them now?
- That's not my fault.

69
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:36,423
Look, forget it. They'll only wrap him up in a
cold sheet, keep him around for three days,

70
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,487
then give him back to the Indians.
Besides, we've got some more business.

71
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,465
All right, boys, full house coming in.
One stretcher. One warm.

72
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,560
Great. Let's go, Chad.

73
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,802
Okay, friend, you can go now.

74
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,750
A little room, Mac. A little room.

75
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,388
Listen, don't you think
this is a funny way to get hurt?

76
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,481
- Sure, friend.
- Don't...

77
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,447
- Aren't you away yet, Miller?
- I will be in a minute.

78
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:34,042
- It's not easy with this hand.
- You sure you can drive?

79
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,021
- Don't worry, I can drive.
- I don't worry. The company worries.

80
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,991
And just remember, if you have an accident,
you're responsible.

81
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,453
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- Cleaner.

82
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,855
<i>All right, Eddie.</i>

83
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,289
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Miss Darr.

84
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:22,062
I was hoping you'd get here earlier. Just put
them in on the bed. I'll hang them up later.

85
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,672
- What have you been doing?
- What?

86
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:38,012
- Your hand, you've hurt it.
- I was playing ball yesterday.

87
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:42,782
- I got spiked in a ball game.
- I didn't know you were a ball player.

88
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:46,248
- I'm a lot of things.
- Man of many talents.

89
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:51,460
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.
- I never seem to know a man like that.

90
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:57,193
- Are you going someplace?
- Not unless I get this down.

91
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,663
- Well, here, here. Let me give you a hand.
- Thanks.

92
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:08,011
Eddie, you're sweet. Just put it on the bed.

93
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:13,750
Actually, I'm only going away
for a couple of days with a friend of mine.

94
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,686
That's why I was hoping
you'd get here earlier, Eddie.

95
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:20,816
- I want you to do me a favor, will you?
- Well, if it's something I can.

96
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:24,794
Well, it's this dress. I tried it on
to see if it was okay this morning,

97
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,226
and then I noticed this stain.
I want to wear it when I go away, Eddie.

98
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,930
Do you think Alpine could do a rush job on
it for me and get it back to me by tomorrow?

99
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,472
Well, I don't know.
I'll have to ask one of the men.

100
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:39,271
- What kind of a stain is it?
- Brandy. At least, I think it's brandy.

101
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,404
There was this drunk the other night,
and I forgot about it.

102
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,175
He must have spilled something,
and I didn't...

103
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,412
- I'll get one of the men to do it.
- Eddie, you're wonderful.

104
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:51,718
Tell you what. You go in the kitchen and get
a beer out of the icebox, and I'll slip this off.

105
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,382
All right.

106
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:03,133
There's an opener right there by the bottles.
Find it all right?

107
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,496
Yes, I found it, Miss Darr.

108
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,745
I'm sorry. I forgot about your hand.
I see you got it opened all right.

109
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,252
Yeah, sure. It was easy.

110
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,983
I didn't know baseball was
such a dangerous game.

111
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,288
- Well, anybody can get hurt anytime.
- You're so right, Eddie.

112
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:34,497
Not just in games, either. Is it hot out?
I haven't been out yet.

113
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:38,161
- No, it's nice.
- But you're sweating.

114
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:42,139
- Am I? I didn't know.
- Well, the beer will cool you off.

115
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:43,999
Excuse me.

116
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:54,043
What is it? Al?
What are you doing up so early?

117
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,145
Sure. Come on up.

118
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,754
That's my friend. He's coming up.

119
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:07,287
Eddie, would you mind finishing
your beer out on the back porch?

120
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,130
Al's just like every other trumpet player.
He's jealous.

121
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:13,194
I wouldn't want him to get any ideas.

122
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:17,174
And I'll expect the dress tomorrow.
You're a darling, Eddie.

123
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,585
Anyone down there?

124
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,919
Gets better every time.
Play it again, Jeannie girl.

125
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,512
Listen, that's five times
I've played it for you already.

126
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,991
- People might want to hear something else.
- No. They ain't listening.

127
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,960
I'm the only one that's listening.
Play it again, Jeannie girl.

128
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,796
- Pete?
- What's the matter, Jeannie?

129
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,000
- Do you want to run off with me?
- It's this man.

130
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:22,267
Five times I've played a song for him,
and now he wants to hear it again.

131
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,673
What's the matter?
You know only one song?

132
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,974
Jeannie knows lots of songs.
Let her play and you'll hear a million songs.

133
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,640
I only want to hear this song.

134
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,946
But maybe somebody else
wants to hear something else.

135
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,418
Maybe I want to hear something else.

136
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:38,786
Listen, I've been paying for this.
I bought nine drinks here tonight.

137
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:43,854
Maybe nine drinks are too many for you.
Maybe you better go home.

138
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,329
Hey, you can't do that to me.

139
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:51,028
I just did it. Now, are you going to leave
quiet or do you need a little help?

140
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:55,836
All right. But you'll be sorry.
Nobody's making a fool out of me.

141
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:01,111
- Nice fellow.
- You ought to be used to it by now.

142
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:07,812
I never get used to it. Jeannie. Play me
something. Play me <i>Plaisir d'amour.</i>

143
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,683
So you can go off in a corner and cry?

144
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:13,816
With that song and the way business is,
I cry right out in public.

145
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:35,371
Are you sure you don't want me
to get you a cab?

146
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,847
Walking's the only exercise I get these days.

147
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,817
But I don't like you out alone
like this at night.

148
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:44,481
What makes you think I'm alone?
After all, I'm leaving early.

149
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,416
How do you know I don't have someone
waiting for me around the corner?

150
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:52,293
- I wish it was me. Good night, Jeannie.
- Good night, Pete.

151
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:09,913
I almost seen it.
I just finished looking out the window,

152
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:14,350
and I went back into the kitchen
to take a pill, and I heard this backfire,

153
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:15,852
and I waited a minute
and I thought to myself

154
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,890
it's a funny kind of a backfire.
I never heard a backfire like that before.

155
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,323
So I went back to the window
and looked and she was laying there,

156
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,190
- and this fellow was bending over her.
- What fellow?

157
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:26,253
Pete, there. The fellow that owns the bar.
He come running out, I guess.

158
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,663
Look. They're going to take another picture.

159
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,127
- Okay.
- Where's Lieutenant Kafka?

160
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,933
- Inside, him and Ferris both.
- Ask him if he's all through out here.

161
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:36,200
- We'd like to take off.
- Okay.

162
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,467
They want to know
if they can remove the body, Lieutenant.

163
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:40,533
Did you get your pictures?

164
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:41,636
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

165
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,044
How about one with
the sheet off, Lieutenant?

166
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,479
- Just one, that's all.
- Not a chance.

167
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:45,777
Why not? What's the matter?

168
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:49,378
Listen, food's too expensive to spoil
people's appetite for breakfast.

169
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,149
I wouldn't want a dead girl on my front page.

170
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,588
You've got one anyway.

171
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,818
I don't like dead girls on the front page
or anywhere else.

172
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:55,951
Should have been with me last night.

173
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:57,494
You wouldn't have liked
a couple of live ones.

174
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:58,551
I had a lot of trouble last night.

175
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,928
You're gonna have a lot of trouble tonight,
too. Get over there to that building.

176
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,800
Start from the roof and check
every apartment that fronts on the street.

177
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,531
I'll be inside seeing what they got to say.

178
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:09,301
- Right.
- Okay. Break it up. Show's over.

179
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,365
Yes, sir. All right, let's go, boys. Break it up.

180
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,434
All right. Go home. Go home!

181
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,241
Well, you see,
I live across the street over there.

182
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,372
Go across the street.

183
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,246
That little girl shouldn't be out
this time of night.

184
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,877
- I'm her mother.
- Well, that makes her a lucky kid.

185
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:25,912
Come on, home, please. Go home. Go home!

186
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:36,893
- I still say we were cheated in that game.
- It's just a game.

187
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,765
- I don't care how it came out.
- Fill her up.

188
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,772
Well, I care how it came out.
I had some money bet on the game.

189
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:45,673
Hey, Mac, you seen that play
on the television tonight, didn't you?

190
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:47,669
Twenty-five.

191
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,909
The one at second
that all that rhubarb was about?

192
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,951
You know, in the fourth
where they thumbed Parsons out.

193
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:59,147
- It's what he deserved.
- Are you smiling at me?

194
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:03,284
- No, I'm smiling at everybody.
- Business good today?

195
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,525
- I'm not a businessman.
- This is what businessmen carry around.

196
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,935
- I'm an engineer.
- On the railroads?

197
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:18,866
No. I build things.
You know, bridges and things.

198
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:23,609
I just got back from Hawaii today.
I was building a bridge in Hawaii.

199
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:27,512
That's why I'm smiling at everybody.
I'm glad to be home.

200
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:31,516
It sure is great to be stateside again.
What do you want? A drink?

201
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:35,786
No, no. I got one back there. That how
you hurt your hand, building the bridge?

202
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:44,998
Oh, that. No, that was on the boat coming
back. They were shooting skeet on the boat.

203
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,631
Gun went off by mistake,
and I got a few slugs in my hand.

204
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:55,806
Poor kid. You know, I like you.
You got a nice face. Poor kid.

205
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:08,153
- What was the name of the bridge?
- The Burnside Bridge.

206
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,795
- What was the name of the river?
- It wasn't on a river.

207
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:18,302
It was between two islands. Five miles long.

208
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,838
Nobody ever built a bridge that long.
That's crazy.

209
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:28,377
- What was the name of the islands?
- Hawaii and Burnside Island.

210
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,441
I never heard of a Burnside Island.
All those islands got Hawaiian names,

211
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:36,783
like Cocowakahiki and stuff like that.
Are you kidding me?

212
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,647
- I said what I said.
- I think you're kidding me.

213
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:44,627
I think you're pulling my leg. Probably got
that hand caught in a wringer or something.

214
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:47,630
- Hey, where are you going?
- Back where they don't pull my leg.

215
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:50,132
I should have stayed where I was.

216
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,484
Coming. Coming.

217
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:19,395
Hello. Who wants him?

218
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,790
Just a minute.

219
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,868
Mr. Miller!

220
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:31,769
Mr. Miller?

221
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:38,943
Mr. Miller? Mr. Miller?

222
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,448
Mr. Miller, are you in there?

223
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,051
What is it?

224
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:54,429
You're still there. It's the cleaners.
It's late and they want to know if you're sick.

225
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,332
- Are you sick?
- No, no. I'm all right.

226
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:02,906
I guess I must have overslept.
Tell them I'll be there as quick as I can.

227
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,335
Ain't like you, Mr. Miller.

228
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:57,658
- When did you start keeping bankers hours?
- I overslept.

229
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:01,256
Listen, Miller, the only one who can
oversleep here is Mr. Alpine.

230
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,630
I don't care which way you cut it,
you're still an errand boy.

231
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,999
- Don't ever forget that.
- It won't happen again.

232
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,628
That's right.

233
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,804
Hey, Eddie. Good thing you came in late.
I got jammed up.

234
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:15,869
- Here's that special you ordered.
- Swell.

235
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:40,895
Yeah. Yeah. Wait a minute.
I'll write that down. Got it. Thanks.

236
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,875
- Where you been?
- Barber's.

237
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,911
- Yeah, you look neat.
- You don't.

238
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,912
- No, I guess I need a shave.
- What difference does it make?

239
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,505
- You're married.
- My wife is visiting her mother.

240
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:54,244
- Shave.
- Ballistics just called.

241
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:57,888
That casing you found on the roof,
it's from an M1 carbine.

242
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,356
The cartridge is called a.30 caliber M1.

243
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:03,291
- That's the only gun it will fit.
- Gives it an Army slant, huh?

244
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:06,855
Listen, every GI who can
pinches one of these when he gets out.

245
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,399
There must be 10,000 of them
kicking around.

246
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,560
There are also a couple million men
in the Army.

247
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:15,163
Well, there's one civilian you can scratch,
the guy she had the beef with in the bar.

248
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,605
They found him
in the drunk tank this morning.

249
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:20,405
He was loaded, went on to another joint,
passed out. He's in the clear.

250
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:22,036
No word from the boyfriend yet.

251
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:24,946
He'll probably turn up
as soon as he reads the papers.

252
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,313
From what I know about musicians,

253
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,512
they're not that neat
when they decide to get rid of their dames.

254
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:33,455
Look, there's a pile of letters over there
by the phone. Run through them, will you?

255
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:49,937
- What's all the excitement?
- A girl evidently got killed last night.

256
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:54,308
That's why all the cops.
A fellow killed her right in the street.

257
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,904
- What fellow?
- They haven't caught him yet.

258
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:59,506
- It was a fellow, all right.
- Well, you wait.

259
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:03,417
- It will turn out to be her boyfriend.
- Mark my words, it always does.

260
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:05,979
Yes, it's getting so nowadays
you can't trust these men.

261
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:08,184
- Yeah.
- It's getting so you can't trust women, either.

262
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,660
Andy Solmes.
Does that name mean anything to you?

263
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:21,136
Yeah. He owns the Mariposa.
Hey, wait a minute.

264
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:25,266
Wasn't he picked up about a year ago
on narcotics charges, charges dismissed?

265
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,937
That's the one. His name's in here.
We'll check on him.

266
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:33,245
Hello? No, this is Sergeant Ferris.
Yeah. Yeah. I'll tell him.

267
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,583
Well, it looks like the boyfriend
read the morning papers.

268
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:38,554
Turned himself in,
and it looks like he's got an alibi.

269
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,591
Figured he would.
Well, we might as well get downtown

270
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,489
and see what he's got to say. Come on.

271
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,724
All I know is that we had lunch yesterday.
We were going to go out of town tomorrow.

272
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,757
That's all I know.
We didn't fight or anything, honest.

273
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:53,531
- I was going to see her...
- Look, Al,

274
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:57,267
for the tenth time, get it through your head,
we know you didn't do it.

275
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,400
We've had you checked.
You got an air-tight alibi,

276
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,205
but the fact remains that somebody did it,

277
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:03,509
and we think that maybe
you can give us a lead.

278
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:08,109
- Did she know any soldiers? Any officers?
- Not while I knew her. She only seen me.

279
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,086
- Are you sure?
- Why shouldn't I be?

280
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,555
- What's soldiers got to do with it?
- How about Solmes?

281
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:16,115
- How about Andy Solmes?
- Who's he?

282
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:18,754
- She had his name in her book.
- I don't know him.

283
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,298
- She did.
- Not while I knew her.

284
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:23,027
She only seen me.

285
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,535
Very well, then,
why were you going out of town?

286
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:53,817
- Got it. Here you go.
- Thanks, mister.

287
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:15,271
It's all your fault. Why don't you
leave us alone and go play your own game?

288
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:39,795
- Mr. Miller. Awful late for you.
- I ate out. I don't feel very well.

289
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:45,207
Do you hear that, Assa? He don't feel well.
Isn't that too bad?

290
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:51,511
- What's the trouble? Stomach?
- No. No. It's my hand. I burned it cooking.

291
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:57,543
What a shame. Assa, do you see that?
He burned his hand cooking.

292
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,924
I'm trying to get Assa
to catch some mice in the cellar.

293
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:04,426
He ought to earn his keep
just like all the rest of us.

294
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:09,559
Shouldn't you, you naughty boy?
You'll have to be careful, Mr. Miller.

295
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:14,003
I do think mothers should teach boys
to cook just as well as girls.

296
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:16,596
My mother never taught me anything.

297
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:23,337
No, you don't. You've got to work, too.
Everybody's got to work in this world.

298
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:39,127
All right, let's settle down.

299
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:43,192
I suppose you all know
why I've called you in here.

300
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,431
In case you don't...

301
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:52,170
Pretty, isn't it?

302
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,077
So, that's how it is.

303
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,570
And before we know it,
everybody who's got a telephone

304
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:58,808
is gonna be on our necks.

305
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,941
"What are you doing about it?"
They're gonna ask.

306
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:04,182
What are you doing about it?
It's a good question.

307
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,348
What are we doing about it?

308
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,427
That's right. Nothing.

309
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:15,188
And until today,
there wasn't much we could do about it.

310
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:18,793
I don't expect you to find
a drop of water in a rainstorm.

311
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,497
But this morning, this was brought in.

312
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:30,946
Here's what it says. Quote,

313
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:34,542
"To the police. Stop me.

314
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:40,716
"Find me and stop me.
I'm going to do it again." Unquote.

315
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:45,261
And it's written on the top of a box
of.30 M1 ammunition,

316
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,923
the same kind that killed
both of these dames.

317
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:49,431
Where'd it come from?

318
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:53,526
Mailman got it in a box at 7th and Sanes.
Turned it in to the central post office.

319
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:55,595
- And they brought it down here.
- Any fingerprints?

320
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,197
Thousands. Everybody
except the postmaster general.

321
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:01,711
But at least it shows us
the type of man we're up against.

322
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:04,337
Now, I don't have to tell you
how much I dislike it.

323
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:07,908
This guy's probably been
saving up for this for years.

324
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:10,078
Now we got to get him and get him quick.
If we don't,

325
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,452
every other loopy in town's
gonna jump on the bandwagon,

326
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,491
and we'll find ourselves knee-deep
in a slaughter house.

327
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:17,391
It's happened before, it can happen again.

328
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:24,930
Frank, both of these have been your babies.
Got you up a tree.

329
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:28,733
- Way up on the top branches.
- Well, before you fall out,

330
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:31,639
check the files for every registered
sex offender of this type.

331
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:34,872
And pay particular attention to those
who have recently done time.

332
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:37,539
How about checking with the Army
on stolen carbines?

333
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:41,584
Yeah. We can do that, too. Especially in
regards to... What do they call them?

334
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:44,519
Section Eights. I'm checking with the FBI
and the police association

335
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:47,148
to find out if they've had
any other cases just like this.

336
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:49,317
Wasn't there a series
in New York like this once?

337
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:50,587
Maybe. We'll find out.

338
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:52,992
I think there was. They never caught the guy.

339
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:55,395
- Could be the same one.
- That was a long time ago.

340
00:43:55,466 --> 00:44:00,631
All right. All right. So that was New York,
this is here. That's why I've called you in.

341
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:03,764
We've got to do something before we all
find ourselves pounding beats again.

342
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:06,366
Now, get out and round up
a bunch of these people,

343
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:08,843
rapists, defilers, peeping Toms, etcetera,

344
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:12,143
everybody we've got
this kind of a record on.

345
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,878
Bring them in. Let's talk to them.

346
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:17,785
Find out where they've been,
what they've been doing lately.

347
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:21,313
Let the newspapers know we're not
sitting around with our feet on the desk.

348
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:25,055
If we're in the dark,
it's our business, nobody else's.

349
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:30,365
- All right, now, get out and earn your money.
- What money?

350
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:42,136
Got them all sorted?

351
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:45,147
As well as I can. First time I ever did this.

352
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:48,184
Well, now we'll see what goes.
All right, first three.

353
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,516
Tinman, Eureka, Debiaci.

354
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:58,022
George Tinman, Peter Eureka, Tony Debiaci.
Walk over there and get a spot.

355
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,597
Face front. Keep your hands to your sides.

356
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:08,796
All right. Settle down.

357
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:09,896
Quiet.

358
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:17,213
<i>First man here is George Tinman.</i>
<i>Three charges against him.</i>

359
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:22,082
<i>1946, 1949 and 1950.</i>

360
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:24,347
<i>What kind of charges, George?</i>

361
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:26,150
<i>You heard me.</i>

362
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:30,023
<i>- They said I was looking in their windows.</i>
<i>- They said? Who? The girls?</i>

363
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:34,287
<i>Looks like they recognized you</i>
<i>all three times.</i>

364
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:35,922
<i>How could they tell? It was dark.</i>

365
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:41,970
<i>Keep your hands at your side.</i>
<i>What you been doing lately, George?</i>

366
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:44,166
<i>I'm a... I'm a swimming instructor.</i>

367
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,300
<i>Do you take your spy glass</i>
<i>to work with you?</i>

368
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:47,843
<i>No, sir.</i>

369
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,505
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>It would rust underwater, wouldn't it?</i>

370
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,516
<i>How about rifles?</i>
<i>Did you ever shoot fish in a barrel?</i>

371
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,347
<i>I never shot a gun in my life.</i>

372
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:59,287
<i>I'm glad, George. I wouldn't want you</i>
<i>to get into any bad habits.</i>

373
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,885
<i>Second man is Peter Eureka.</i>

374
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,690
<i>Peter's a letter writer.</i>
<i>Not a very nice one, either.</i>

375
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:09,290
<i>He writes to strange women, and</i>
<i>he's frightened a lot of them pretty badly.</i>

376
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:13,166
<i>How about that, Pete, don't you like women?</i>
<i>Never been married?</i>

377
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:15,797
<i>- Three times.</i>
<i>- Three times.</i>

378
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,500
<i>Why'd all these happy homes break up?</i>

379
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:20,236
<i>Did you spend all your wives'</i>
<i>household money for stamps?</i>

380
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:25,407
<i>- I did the breaking up.</i>
<i>- Yeah. I guess you probably did.</i>

381
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:28,747
<i>You know, Pete, I read somewhere</i>
<i>that the pen is mightier than the sword.</i>

382
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:32,311
<i>- How about that? Did you ever try a sword?</i>
<i>- I never had a sword.</i>

383
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:36,052
<i>What about a rifle? I guess maybe</i>
<i>you thought a rifle was the best thing of all.</i>

384
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:40,756
<i>- I never shot anybody.</i>
<i>- Not even maybe an odd wife or two?</i>

385
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:42,025
<i>I never shot anybody.</i>

386
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,090
<i>And what about Eureka?</i>
<i>What does that mean?</i>

387
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:48,798
<i>Every day I hear somebody yell, "Eureka!"</i>
<i>They talking about you, Pete?</i>

388
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,499
<i>I don't know what it means.</i>

389
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:53,270
<i>That's too bad.</i>
<i>I thought I was gonna get to find out.</i>

390
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,538
You're wasting your time, Andy.
It's none of these men.

391
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:58,547
- There's a lot more coming.
- It won't be any of those, either.

392
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,743
You're the police psychiatrist.
Suppose you turn up the guy we want.

393
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:03,912
What makes you so sure, Doctor?

394
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,114
- It's my job.
- And this is ours.

395
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,920
<i>Next man is Anthony Debiaci.</i>

396
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:12,725
<i>Ant, put your hands at your side</i>
<i>and keep them there.</i>

397
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:18,198
<i>Anthony Debiaci.</i>
<i>Tony's a rapist, two-time loser.</i>

398
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:21,135
<i>We had him in last week on the same charge</i>
<i>and couldn't make it stick.</i>

399
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:23,901
<i>That woman just picked me out.</i>
<i>I never saw her before.</i>

400
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:27,375
<i>Still saying it, huh, Tony?</i>
<i>Well, maybe she did make a mistake.</i>

401
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:28,911
<i>Soured you on women.</i>

402
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:31,174
<i>Turned you into a real killer.</i>
<i>Is that what it did?</i>

403
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:35,548
<i>- You can't pin anything on me this time.</i>
<i>- Not even a rose?</i>

404
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:39,749
<i>What a shame.</i>
<i>What have you been doing lately, Tony?</i>

405
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:43,020
<i>- Minding my own business.</i>
<i>- What business is that?</i>

406
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:47,928
<i>- I got a job. I make deliveries.</i>
<i>- Get you into a lot of houses?</i>

407
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:49,295
<i>I do my job.</i>

408
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:53,803
<i>Yeah, I'll bet you do.</i>
<i>All right, you three can go now.</i>

409
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:56,269
- I'll see you later, Andy.
- Leaving already?

410
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,572
- We got a dozen more to run through.
- You still won't find the man you want.

411
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,406
See you, Captain.

412
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:05,074
- He's a great help.
- Keep your shirt on. He knows his job.

413
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:06,240
Yeah, but does he know ours?

414
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:11,253
<i>Next is Dan Wormel.</i>
<i>Dan's a tough guy with small animals.</i>

415
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,755
- Kafka?
- Hello, Doc.

416
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:19,125
- Meeting somebody?
- No.

417
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:20,891
- Come on, sit down.
- Thank you.

418
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:22,761
- Hello, Lieutenant.
- Hiya, Tom.

419
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:26,428
- Get me an order of tomato beef, will you?
- Sure thing.

420
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:27,868
Dig in.

421
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:31,396
- I didn't know you liked Chinese food.
- It's good and it's cheap.

422
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:33,534
They're not breaking their arms
paying us, you know.

423
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,134
You can say that again.

424
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:39,273
Me, I just happen to like it.
Been eating it ever since I can remember.

425
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:40,816
It's funny I've never seen you in here.

426
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:43,944
Well, I eat here a lot,
but half the time I'm out in left field.

427
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,956
- Find your man in the show up?
- Are you kidding?

428
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,457
Just asking.

429
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:51,892
You know,
this sniper thing is driving me crazy.

430
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:55,056
There's some things I understand
and some things I don't.

431
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:57,828
If a guy blows his top
and sticks a knife into somebody,

432
00:48:57,901 --> 00:48:59,698
on the spur of the moment, that is,

433
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:03,671
I understand it, so does the law.
It's second degree.

434
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:06,232
And if a guy decides to knock off his wife
and spend six months

435
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:09,507
figuring out how to do it,
I understand that, too.

436
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,206
That's first degree.

437
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,045
- But this thing I don't get.
- You will.

438
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,415
- Will what?
- Get him.

439
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:19,614
Sure. After he's shot down 30 or 40 dames.

440
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:23,626
- By that time, I'll be back pounding a beat.
- No, it won't take that long.

441
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:25,355
Though I'll tell you one thing.

442
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:28,489
You won't get him by running show ups
like the one I saw.

443
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:31,432
Look, Doc, those show ups
pay off more than you think.

444
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:34,061
Not in a case like this.

445
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:37,436
Look, Kafka, let me tell you something
about these people.

446
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,498
Anderson calls them nuts.

447
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:42,272
Psychiatrists use $10 words,
but whatever you call them,

448
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:45,247
they run to a pattern and they don't overlap.

449
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:49,809
They're all in...
In little water-tight compartments.

450
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:51,911
Well, so are most criminals, for that matter.

451
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,958
If you have an armed robbery, you don't
waste time rounding up pickpockets.

452
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:58,256
- Sure. That's right.
- It's the same thing in this case.

453
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:01,525
Now, you had a peeping Tom
in the show up.

454
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:05,227
All right. Now peeping Toms
don't kill women. They stick to peeping.

455
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:10,797
Rapists don't write poison pen letters.
Obscene letter writers don't commit rape.

456
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:15,743
All criminal types and especially
sex offenders stay in their own grooves.

457
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:18,406
So, if you keep dragging
everyone in the book into a show up,

458
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:23,078
- you're just wasting your time.
- Okay. What type are we gonna look for?

459
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:26,884
I'd look for somebody who's been getting
tough with women from the very beginning.

460
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:30,586
Maybe he started small, slugging them
on a dark street or something like that.

461
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,787
But whatever he did,
it'd be a crime of violence.

462
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,229
- That you can be sure of.
- Cute kid.

463
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:37,630
- Very.
- How'd he get that way?

464
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:41,364
Could be one of a thousand reasons.

465
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:44,896
Maybe some woman did something mean
to him when he was a kid.

466
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:49,639
He may not even remember what it was,
but something in here remembers.

467
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,705
Perhaps it was his mother.
Usually is in these cases.

468
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:55,650
Whoever it was, it was probably
a brunette in her late 20s.

469
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,687
Of course, it doesn't matter now.

470
00:50:57,754 --> 00:51:01,246
He's past the stage
where he could have been talked out of it.

471
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:05,351
And whoever it was,
he's killing her over and over again.

472
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:09,690
What's the matter?

473
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:11,631
I guess I better stick to a fork.

474
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,298
He's killing her over and over again.

475
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,739
He's been doing it in his mind for years.

476
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:22,006
Now that he started doing it for real,
he's gonna keep right on doing it.

477
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,810
- For how long?
- As long as he doesn't get caught.

478
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:27,975
And as long as his cartridges last.

479
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,986
<i>Nelson is running to third.</i>
<i>The ball bounces off the left-field wall.</i>

480
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:37,493
<i>A quick pick up, but Nelson is streaking</i>
<i>for home plate. He's safe.</i>

481
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:40,621
<i>Jackson holds it up at second.</i>
<i>What a ball game this is!</i>

482
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:46,795
<i>And you say this will be a costume ball,</i>
<i>Mrs. Fitzpatrick? What will the motif be?</i>

483
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:51,933
<i>Well, it's American history, but before 1900.</i>
<i>No costume after 1900.</i>

484
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:55,444
<i>That sounds wonderful.</i>
<i>Will it include Indians?</i>

485
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:59,949
<i>I hope it will include hundreds of Indians.</i>

486
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:04,111
<i>- I love Indians, too.</i>
<i>- After all, Indians are part of our history, too.</i>

487
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:08,488
<i>Indeed they are,</i>
<i>and a very important part, too.</i>

488
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:12,995
<i>Well, tell me, Mrs. Fitzpatrick,</i>
<i>where will the public be able to buy tickets</i>

489
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:17,329
<i>for this charity ball given for the benefit</i>
<i>of Saint Stephen's Hospital Guild?</i>

490
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,460
<i>Well, they can buy them</i>
<i>at the Women's Civic League.</i>

491
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:23,734
<i>Or those wishing to come</i>
<i>can write me directly at my home.</i>

492
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:28,904
<i>It's 380 Kendel Drive. They're $10 apiece,</i>

493
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:33,848
<i>and we just hope that everybody</i>
<i>who can come will come.</i>

494
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,646
<i>I'm sure they will.</i>

495
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:38,210
<i>Well, thank you so much,</i>
<i>Mrs. Warren Fitzpatrick,</i>

496
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:43,453
<i>for this clear picture of the activities</i>
<i>of the Women's Civic League.</i>

497
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:48,260
Now, look. You can't block the door like that.
People want to come in and out.

498
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,263
I wish I talked to Dr. Kent before.

499
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,670
Might have saved us a lot of time
and a lot of trouble.

500
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:00,972
- We've still got a lot of trouble.
- Come on. Come on.

501
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:03,477
We're a lot further along.
We know one thing.

502
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:08,007
These psychiatric offenders don't overlap.

503
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:10,314
Get him. Okay, so they don't overlap,

504
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,582
- but we still got a lot of them.
- What's the matter with you?

505
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:13,953
- You had a fight with your girl?
- Yeah.

506
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:17,460
She doesn't like the kind of hours
I've been keeping lately.

507
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,985
Hey, here's one that might fit the pattern.
He's out on parole now.

508
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:25,467
He's had one, two, three, six convictions.

509
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:27,601
Likes to use a club.

510
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:31,003
Six convictions? That probably means
he's gotten away with 12 others.

511
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:33,907
Man, you're just overflowing
with information tonight.

512
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:35,808
I sure am.

513
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:40,282
Here's a guy who had his first conviction for
cracking a girl's skull with a baseball bat.

514
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,882
She must have struck him out
and he got mad.

515
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:44,818
What'd he do then?
Go on to bigger and better things?

516
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,516
That's right. Bigger and better things.

517
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:50,025
Three suspicions of assaults against women.

518
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:51,890
One assault where
there was no suspicion at all.

519
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:55,955
He got an 18-month stretch for that one.
I think we'll look into Mr. Miller.

520
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:57,556
- Tom Kafka?
- Yeah.

521
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,795
Just came over the Teletype.
They want you out there.

522
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,803
- Out where?
- 380 Kendel Drive.

523
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:04,602
There's been another murder.
Looks like the sniper again.

524
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:06,335
- What's the name?
- Warren Fitzpatrick.

525
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:09,344
It was Mrs. Fitzpatrick that was killed.

526
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,676
Warren Fitzpatrick?
That will blow the lid off.

527
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,148
What do you mean will blow the lid off?
It's already blown it.

528
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:16,651
Come on, let's go.

529
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:20,619
- What's going on?
- They killed someone.

530
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:23,215
- Where?
- In that driveway over there.

531
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:26,061
The nurse was down in the kitchen
getting herself a glass of milk

532
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:27,562
when she heard the shot.

533
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:29,189
She called us right after.

534
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,496
There's a chance
we might nail the guy this time.

535
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:33,263
The section's full of prowl cars.

536
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:35,634
We know. We saw half a dozen of them
on the way up here.

537
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:38,833
- You know what this will mean?
- Let's not talk about it.

538
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:42,036
- I wouldn't want to be in your shoes.
- They'd hurt your feet anyway.

539
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,205
- Where's her husband?
- Fitzpatrick? Beats me.

540
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:48,741
Downtown somewheres.
They're trying to find him.

541
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:50,786
This looks like him now.

542
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:15,604
- Where are the children?
- Upstairs, Mr. Fitzpatrick. They're asleep.

543
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:20,609
How long is it going on?
What are you doing about it?

544
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:25,917
We're doing everything we can,
Mr. Fitzpatrick. I'm very sorry.

545
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,891
What are you doing about it?
What are you going to do about it?

546
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:38,963
Listen, the whole city's gone crazy.

547
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:42,994
I come to work this morning on the streetcar
and everybody's reading the newspaper,

548
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:46,406
all about the sniper, even talking about it,

549
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:49,411
you know, people who never
talk to each other any other time.

550
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:53,176
Yeah. I leave my joint this morning,
I hear my wife lock the door.

551
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:57,208
She never locked the door before.
She's one scared dame.

552
00:55:57,287 --> 00:56:00,723
- How about you? You scared?
- For her or for me?

553
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:03,725
For her.
He's just killing dames, the paper says.

554
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,455
So this week he's killing dames,

555
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:10,056
so next week it's guys with one leg
or false teeth or something.

556
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,829
Or maybe guys who work in cleaning plants.

557
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:16,167
You better stay home nights, Joey.
Maybe he's got his eye on you.

558
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:18,503
No, just dames, the paper says.

559
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:19,872
Listen, if he wants to get in touch with me,

560
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:22,878
I'll give him the addresses of two,
maybe three.

561
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:26,473
- Dames never done me any good.
- You should have heard my wife at breakfast.

562
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:29,643
Why, you'd think she'd expect me
to go out and catch him myself.

563
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,779
Somebody better catch him.
Cops ain't doing any good.

564
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:36,758
There's an editorial in the paper.
Papers are plenty sore at the cops.

565
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:38,316
Papers! What do they know?

566
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:41,455
Scream till they get the guy
and then when they have the trial,

567
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:45,331
why, they cry in their beer because
the guy's probably innocent after all.

568
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:48,667
Take a dame that's on trial for murder.
Unless she's got two heads,

569
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,706
why, they think she's beautiful.

570
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:54,642
If I get my hands on the guy,
they wouldn't have to worry about no trial.

571
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:58,272
- Yeah? What would you do to him?
- He wouldn't die quick, I'll tell you that.

572
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:01,442
Mr. Lydell, I'm sure no one
regrets any more than I do

573
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:04,281
the outrages perpetrated on these women.

574
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,187
Mrs. Fitzpatrick, in particular,
was a very good friend of mine...

575
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,987
Mr. Mayor, this isn't a personal matter.

576
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:13,187
The people of this city are alarmed
and frightened.

577
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,664
There's a maniac loose
and the police seem helpless.

578
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:19,099
That's why we've asked for this conference.

579
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:21,899
We want to know why such
a state of affairs can continue.

580
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:23,962
Chief?

581
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,498
As far as the people
being frightened goes, Mr. Lydell,

582
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:29,511
maybe your newspaper
has something to do with it.

583
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:32,139
My newspaper merely reports the news.
It doesn't make it.

584
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:35,616
It slants the news. It exploits hysteria.

585
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:38,745
That doesn't solve your problem.
You still haven't caught the man.

586
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:41,814
Most killers are caught because of motive.
There's no motive here.

587
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,791
Murder itself can be a motive.

588
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,420
We're short foot patrolmen, Mr. Harper.

589
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:49,761
If you want to volunteer,
I'm sure we can find a place for you.

590
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:53,291
I'm efficient at my job.
Evidently your men aren't efficient at theirs.

591
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:55,929
I agree. The police have shown themselves
unimaginative and...

592
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:59,771
- Now, hold on, Mr. Weiss...
- Just a moment, gentlemen.

593
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:03,107
Mr. Weiss, I'm not trying
to defend my administration,

594
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:06,138
but I seem to remember
that two years ago when we tried

595
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:10,243
to get the police budget increased,
your group fought us tooth and nail.

596
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,878
Taxes are high enough as it is.

597
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:16,119
And as far as that goes, we're getting
very little value for the taxes we do pay.

598
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:21,789
Mr. Lydell, please. I think we're
going at this thing like little children.

599
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:25,301
Lieutenant Kafka here has been on the case
since the beginning.

600
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:27,836
Perhaps, if we can continue
meeting reasonably,

601
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:30,429
with his giving us a sketch
of what has happened to date, we might...

602
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,998
We know what's happened up to date.

603
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:36,534
What we want to know is
what's going to happen from now on.

604
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:39,104
We want this man caught and caught quick.

605
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:42,208
And punished. Punished. Punished.

606
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:48,113
Well, if everyone's going to sound off,
I guess I might as well get in the act.

607
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,819
You mention punishment, Mr. Lydell.

608
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:52,828
Just what sort of punishment
did you have in mind?

609
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:55,831
The sort the man's crimes deserve.

610
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:57,992
He ought to be killed
the way a mad dog is killed.

611
00:58:58,067 --> 00:58:59,091
- That's right.
- Absolutely.

612
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,669
Or put in the insane asylum.

613
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:04,068
Do you know the legal definition of insanity?

614
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:07,371
- No.
- I'll tell you.

615
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:09,877
It's based on an old English law,

616
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:13,313
a law passed
when they were still burning witches.

617
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,112
An insane person, according to the law,

618
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:18,119
must not be able to tell the difference
between right and wrong.

619
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:21,486
Well, obviously, this man doesn't know
the difference between right and wrong.

620
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,924
Don't be too sure of that.

621
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:27,485
You see, Mr. Stonecroft, there are
hundreds of thousands of sex offenders

622
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:32,797
walking American streets at this moment
who could be the sniper or worse.

623
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:36,430
But only 1% of them are legally insane.

624
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:40,704
1%, Mr. Stonecroft.
Now what will we do with the other 99?

625
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:44,304
Never mind the other 99.
Let's get back to the matter in hand.

626
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:47,008
- The madman who's loose with a rifle.
- Carbine.

627
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,711
Get back to him, Mr. Lydell?
I've never left him.

628
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:51,344
And I'll tell you something.

629
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:55,653
When this man is caught, you'll find he has
a record dating back to when he was a kid.

630
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:57,920
Believe me,
he's been in the hands of the police before.

631
00:59:57,994 --> 01:00:01,122
Thirty days for one thing,
60 days for another.

632
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:03,028
And I'll tell you something else.

633
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,431
If his first act had led to treatment
instead of jail,

634
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,128
three women wouldn't be lying dead today.

635
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:09,637
The fact remains
three women are lying dead today.

636
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:13,301
- And the killer's still loose.
- Yes, loose because of us.

637
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:15,003
And a killer because of us.

638
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:18,138
And the horrible thing about it is
we may be sitting here six months from now

639
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:21,650
or three months from now
on another case just like it.

640
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:25,051
Gentlemen, the city is frightened,

641
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,145
and when cities get frightened,

642
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:31,091
they rear up on their hind legs
and strike out at something, anything.

643
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,459
This time we have a chance not to strike out
blindly, but to act with reason.

644
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:36,828
This time we can do something.

645
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:40,960
You all have weight and power,
not only in the city, but in the state.

646
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:43,938
Put your weight behind
getting a new law passed.

647
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:45,975
Let every socially dangerous sex offender,

648
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:50,979
as soon as he is caught for his first offense,
be committed to a mental institution,

649
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,015
and there he can be cured
or put away indefinitely.

650
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,278
- I think...
- What is this you think?

651
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:58,081
Who cares what you think?

652
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:00,145
The important thing to think about
is three dead women,

653
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:01,746
not coddling the man who killed them.

654
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:05,659
Look, I'm thinking of the hundreds of women
who will be dead if something isn't done.

655
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:10,856
Now, listen, Mr. Harper, just...
Just let me give you an example.

656
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:13,401
A few years ago a man named Albert Fish

657
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:16,734
was executed in New York
for the murder of a child.

658
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:19,297
A judge of the state supreme court
estimated that this man

659
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:23,778
had undoubtedly killed at least 15 others.

660
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:27,839
Now, he was executed for one,
but 16 were dead.

661
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:30,249
And this is not an isolated case.
It happens everywhere.

662
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:34,050
Perhaps not every day,
but much, much too often.

663
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:36,387
So, I repeat, pass a law.

664
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:39,519
Put these people away
when they're first caught.

665
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:42,428
And those who can be cured, will be cured.

666
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:47,629
And those who can't, well,
at least they'll never get out to try it again.

667
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:48,864
If you can get a law like this passed,

668
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:52,635
you could start a ball rolling
all across this country.

669
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:57,078
Get a law like that passed
and this meeting could be a milestone.

670
01:01:57,146 --> 01:01:59,944
Where's the money coming from
for an institution like that?

671
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,539
Taxes.

672
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:06,487
- Well, that would have to be a state matter.
- I can hear the governor screaming already.

673
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:07,989
When I saw Dr. Kent come in,

674
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:12,016
I had a feeling this meeting would eventually
come down to psychiatric mumbo jumbo,

675
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:15,587
and I wasn't wrong. It has.

676
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:18,327
So we're right back where we started.

677
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,062
There's a crazy man loose in the streets

678
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:24,766
and the police are too busy
passing the buck to catch him.

679
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:28,641
Well, Mr. Mayor and Mr. Chief of Police

680
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:35,410
and Mr. Psychiatrist, let this sink in.

681
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,715
Unless he's caught very, very soon,

682
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:43,054
this administration is going to find itself
shaken right off its foundations.

683
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:46,027
Planning to make a political football
out of it?

684
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,995
Call it anything you like.

685
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:51,158
Gentlemen, thank you
for giving us your time.

686
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:03,202
Well, it's still sitting right in my lap,
and all I have to do is catch him.

687
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:09,445
Sure. You'll catch him and they'll kill him
and everybody will forget about it.

688
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:12,454
That is, until the next one comes along,

689
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:14,251
and it'll start all over again.

690
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:44,475
- Where'd he go?
- Back this way.

691
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:52,418
Drop that gun. Make sure I hear it hit.

692
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:03,121
I ought to beat your brains out.

693
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:14,943
What's the matter with you, Rivers?
This gun hasn't been fired in years.

694
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:16,603
The hammer doesn't work,
and there's no firing pin.

695
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:20,046
Look, Lieutenant, the way things are today,
you jump first, then ask the questions.

696
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:22,346
I saw the gun, I brought him in.

697
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:25,581
- Where'd you get this, son?
- It used to belong to my father.

698
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:28,215
- What were you doing up on the roof?
- Nothing.

699
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,657
Well, you were up there pointing this.
You think that's nothing?

700
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:34,856
- I didn't hurt anybody.
- No, and you're not going to.

701
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:38,162
Okay, Rivers, take him out and let him go.

702
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:41,169
If your father wants his gun,
you tell him it's down here.

703
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:44,570
Go ahead and keep the gun.
You think I care about the gun?

704
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,734
I know where there's plenty of guns
and plenty of bullets, too.

705
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:50,472
You think there's only one guy
in this town that doesn't like people?

706
01:05:50,546 --> 01:05:52,878
There's millions of them,
and I know who they are.

707
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,247
They can get me
all the guns and bullets I want.

708
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:57,411
You can't kick me around...

709
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:03,519
Take him over to the city hospital
and see what they think in the psycho ward.

710
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:05,583
- But you just said...
- It doesn't matter what I just said.

711
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:08,255
What does matter is
that I just got an idea about him.

712
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:11,596
I don't want to be looking for him
in a couple of years when he's got a real gun

713
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:14,158
or maybe an ax. Go ahead.

714
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:30,248
- Gonna have a nice weekend, Miller?
- Yeah, I guess so. I don't know.

715
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:33,345
I want you to do something for me
before you come back on Monday.

716
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:35,652
- Think you can?
- What?

717
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:37,488
Change that bandage.

718
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:43,024
- I can't change it.
- Then find someone who can. It's filthy.

719
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:46,535
We can't have our drivers going around
with things like that on their hands.

720
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:49,503
I don't want to see it on your hand Monday.

721
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:12,558
This way, Lieutenant.

722
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,070
- Is it the sniper?
- Sure, it's the sniper.

723
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,768
- One side, please. Let us through.
- Hey, how many does that make, four?

724
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:29,174
Why don't you do something?
Earn your money.

725
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:32,214
They're always there after it happens.

726
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:34,977
Getting so you can't even go to a park
on a Sunday.

727
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,882
Some police force.

728
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:40,388
- How long ago did it happen?
- About 15 minutes ago.

729
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:43,482
- You got here fast enough.
- Where did the shot come from?

730
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,049
Where did the shot come from?

731
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:51,298
I don't know. We were just walking, and
she said, "Let's sit down," and she sat down

732
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:52,766
and I was about to sit down myself when...

733
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:54,393
Look around, Joe,
and see what you can find.

734
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:55,801
Right.

735
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:59,534
Can you think of anybody
that you've had any trouble with lately?

736
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:04,841
- Anybody mad at her?
- No. She got along fine with everybody.

737
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,941
I never seen her fight with anyone,
except me once in a while.

738
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:11,486
Everybody liked Sandy.

739
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:14,921
- Hey, I found the shell.
- Put that down, you idiot!

740
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:16,252
What's the matter with you? You crazy?

741
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:18,418
- Sorry, I forgot.
- You forgot...

742
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:19,447
Hey. Be careful.

743
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:49,175
I know a 10-year-old kid who can do
better than that with his left hand.

744
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:53,486
If they're all like you,
I might just as well go to sleep.

745
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:59,752
Three balls for nine. Nine for a quarter.
Let's see you knock her in the water.

746
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:03,491
Say, you look like a pitcher.
How about you there?

747
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:04,828
Nine. Nine it is.

748
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:07,460
Hey, Don, he looks like a pitcher,
an empty pitcher.

749
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:15,867
- Yep, I might just as well go to sleep.
- Maybe you need a basketball, Mac.

750
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:19,738
He's pitching for...

751
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:23,546
Pretty lucky.

752
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:38,766
Offhand I can think of three ball clubs
that can use this guy.

753
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:05,622
Did you ever see anything like that?

754
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:07,017
Are you sure, Doctor?

755
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:11,066
Nobody with a burned hand, say,
in the past two weeks?

756
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:14,591
Not even a woman? I see.

757
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:18,197
Well, thank you, Doctor. I'm sorry to have
disturbed you at this hour of the night.

758
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:22,506
Goodbye. Oh, boy,
how many does that make?

759
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:24,136
I don't know. I lost count.

760
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:28,172
Well, the next one's Shipley.
Harold Shipley. Eldemont Fall, 1919.

761
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:31,646
You take over for a while.

762
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:35,121
I'll be talking to doctors in my sleep.
Not that I'll be getting any sleep.

763
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:37,624
- Teletypes, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.

764
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:54,138
Hello, can I talk to Dr. Shipley, please?
Sergeant Ferris, Homicide.

765
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:58,043
Police Department. What?

766
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:01,879
I'm sorry to hear that.
Who's handling his practice?

767
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:05,010
Yeah, I see.

768
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:07,420
Well, thanks very much.
I'm sorry I disturbed you.

769
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:10,925
Dr. Shipley's been sick himself for months.

770
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:16,124
Dr. Holiday is handling his practice,
and we have talked to Dr. Holiday.

771
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:19,326
- Anything in the Teletypes?
- No. Just the usual.

772
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:21,130
Somebody had a target in his backyard.

773
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:24,001
Some dame thinks
the sniper's been spying on her.

774
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:26,633
Some other dame says a guy's been
throwing baseballs at her,

775
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:30,645
which is funny because that's her job,
having baseballs thrown at her.

776
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:34,877
Some man wants us to... Baseballs?

777
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:39,379
- Where you going?
- File room.

778
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:51,324
Homicide. Sergeant Ferris. Hiya, Scott.
Where are you?

779
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,267
What? No kidding.

780
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:56,861
Hey, that's great. Yeah, we'll be right over.

781
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,074
Hey, Frank, they found out
where they put on the bandage.

782
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:11,676
- No kidding.
- That's what I said. Come on, huh?

783
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:12,743
What have you got there?

784
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:14,880
I don't know yet, but maybe
it's the guy they put the bandage on.

785
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:19,660
That's the one. That's not the name he gave.

786
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:22,595
- Burnside he called himself.
- He called himself Edward, though.

787
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:24,427
- How about the address?
- That will be a phony.

788
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,934
And the one under the name of Miller
will be out of date.

789
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:29,630
He's probably moved five times
since he registered.

790
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:33,300
- How did he act when he was here?
- As I remember, sort of strange.

791
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:37,675
I tried to talk, you know, cheerfully,
but he wasn't buying any.

792
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,078
We thought of sending him up to Psycho,
but something came up...

793
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:45,052
- There was a very bad accident case came in.
- That's right. That's what it was.

794
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:49,113
Wait a minute. There was something
he said to me at the end.

795
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:52,820
He said... What was it?

796
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:57,298
Yes. He said, "Don't you think
this is a funny way to get hurt?"

797
01:13:57,366 --> 01:14:02,201
Or something like that.
I was so busy, I didn't pay any attention.

798
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:05,467
I guess maybe he wanted to stop himself.

799
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:10,103
Maybe he wanted to stop himself for years.
Maybe nobody else paid any attention either.

800
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:20,218
They better get this nut.

801
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,314
Next thing you know
he'll be coming right into your house.

802
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:27,385
- I think it's horrible. Who'd he kill this time?
- Girl walking in the park with her boyfriend.

803
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:31,331
But he left a bandage behind him.
Maybe that's clue enough for them.

804
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,992
I certainly hope so.

805
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:35,696
Wherever you go these days
that's all people talk about.

806
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:37,671
You can say that again.

807
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:42,505
Did you say a bandage?

808
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:45,376
Yeah. They found it on a bush
right by the cartridge case.

809
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:49,349
- What kind of a bandage?
- Wait a minute.

810
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:51,147
Yeah, here it is.

811
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:56,351
"Police laboratory technicians report that
the bandage is from a man's right hand,

812
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:59,519
"evidently covering a bad burn. They also..."

813
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:19,103
Operator, give me
the police department, please.

814
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:22,412
- Are you sure you got the place surrounded?
- He can get in, but he won't get out.

815
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:24,714
- Is he often late?
- Is he?

816
01:15:24,786 --> 01:15:27,619
Maybe three times
in the last couple of weeks, Mr. Alpine.

817
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:29,156
But I warned him. I told him if it happened...

818
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:31,385
- Do you know his number?
- Yes, I know it.

819
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,257
Call his place
and see if he's left for work yet.

820
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:35,193
- Yes, sir.
- Tell me, Lieutenant,

821
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:37,789
do you think you can keep the name
of the establishment out of this?

822
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:39,424
It will be very bad for business, very bad.

823
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:41,935
Don't talk to me about that, Mr. Alpine.
Talk to the reporters.

824
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:42,993
There must be some way...

825
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:47,599
Hello, this is the Alpine Cleaners and Dyers.
Has Eddie Miller left for work yet?

826
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:51,806
What? I see. Thank you.

827
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,508
He left half an hour ago.
He ought to be here by now.

828
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:58,349
- How many men you got out there, Joe?
- I don't know. Maybe 15, 20.

829
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:00,615
Where is he? Why isn't he here?
What's keeping him this time?

830
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:40,627
Marsha, wait a minute.

831
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:15,160
Hey, the sniper! Hey, the sniper!

832
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:21,066
Hey! Hey, over there! The sniper! Hey! Hey!

833
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:24,503
Over there! The sniper! The sniper!

834
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:30,842
He's got a gun! Look out! The sniper!
Look out! Hey!

835
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:32,880
Hey! Somebody look!

836
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:42,282
Hey, look! Up here! Hey, the sniper!
Here on the roof!

837
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:45,884
Why did you have to do that?
I didn't kill her.

838
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:50,125
You can see I didn't kill her.
Why do you have to yell like that?

839
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:51,495
Hey!

840
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:26,705
<i>... and requests that any citizen</i>
<i>who knows of any man</i>

841
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:30,080
<i>who has had a badly burned right hand</i>
<i>within the past two weeks</i>

842
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:34,110
<i>to report him to the police immediately.</i>
<i>He may be the sniper.</i>

843
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:38,717
<i>I repeat, he may be the sniper.</i>
<i>We know that this man...</i>

844
01:21:38,793 --> 01:21:42,752
Burned hands, snipers,
I don't know what the world's coming to.

845
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:44,765
Do you, Assa?

846
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:50,137
Why, Mr. Miller,
what brings you home from work at this...

847
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:06,067
- You can't go down there.
- Well, we want to see what's going on.

848
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:08,632
- There's nothing to see.
- Come on, handsome.

849
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,177
You heard me.

850
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:21,313
- What's up? What's going on?
- Nothing we need you for. Stay back.

851
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:23,914
They got the sniper up there.
He lives up this street.

852
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:24,981
I hope they kill him.

853
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:28,689
Get somebody into that school up there.
Tell them to keep those kids inside.

854
01:24:28,763 --> 01:24:29,821
Right.

855
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,866
- Hi, Frank. Where you been?
- Scene of the crime.

856
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:34,527
- Looks like we missed it.
- Yeah. Well, we won't miss him this time.

857
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:36,001
Which house?

858
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:44,572
That one with the shades drawn.
He's holed up in his room there.

859
01:24:44,646 --> 01:24:47,137
You know, some solid citizens
are gonna get their brains blown out

860
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:48,341
if they don't pull their heads in.

861
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:51,214
- Not that they got any brains to begin with.
- Why don't you tell them?

862
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:53,015
I'm waiting for the sound truck.

863
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,749
Have you sent any of our men
into the house?

864
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:57,792
- No. I figure on using tear gas.
- I'll go in.

865
01:24:57,859 --> 01:24:59,588
- Don't be foolish, Frank.
- Why not?

866
01:24:59,694 --> 01:25:01,355
