1
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:25,823
<i>I come tonight to warn you
that you will be visited by three spirits.</i>

2
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,976
<i>What?</i>

3
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:32,413
<i>Was that the chance and hope
that you mentioned, Jacob?</i>

4
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,048
<i>It was.</i>

5
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:38,353
<i>You have yet the chance
and hope of escaping my fate.</i>

6
00:03:38,453 --> 00:03:41,797
<i>A chance and hope
of my procuring, Ebenezer.</i>

7
00:03:41,897 --> 00:03:43,830
<i>Thank you, Jacob.</i>

8
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:49,200
<i>Expect the first when the bell tolls 1:00.</i>

9
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,967
- Shut up, Beth!
- I don't care who started it, Max.

10
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:57,057
Ben started it and everybody knows it.
We even have the whole thing on video.

11
00:03:57,205 --> 00:04:00,475
You're gonna write an apology to the rest
of your class for ruining the recital.

12
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:03,377
What were you thinking, Max?
That kid was twice your size.

13
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:06,130
Yeah, but Ben Kuklinski
is always ragging on Christmas.

14
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,150
He even told the first graders that Santa
was just a cheap marketing ploy

15
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,876
- invented to sell Pepsi.
- Coke.

16
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:13,612
- You know what I mean.
- But not why you care.

17
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:17,158
- Well, someone's got to.
- Here, let me see.

18
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,361
It's not so bad. Just keep icing it.

19
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:24,666
And was drop-kicking him into the manger
really the best way to handle this?

20
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:27,887
Okay, that was not my fault.
I was under the influence.

21
00:04:27,987 --> 00:04:30,204
All I had to eat was Christmas fudge
and candy canes.

22
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,680
Well, I hate to sound harsh, but every
kid has to learn the truth someday.

23
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:39,313
Oh, I know. I just...
I didn't want it ruined.

24
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,215
For the little kids.

25
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:45,453
<i>But is this a war on Christmas,
a war on over-political correctness...</i>

26
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:48,572
- Looks great, Mom.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

27
00:04:48,672 --> 00:04:52,006
Don't work too hard, though. Sarah bought
a bunch of cookies at the store.

28
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:53,694
It's Roger.

29
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,530
Thought you said you
weren't working over Christmas.

30
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,066
I said no traveling over Christmas.
I still have to take a few calls.

31
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,468
Hey, Roger, what's up?

32
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:04,505
Aren't we still gonna watch Charlie Brown
and wrap Christmas presents like always?

33
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:07,594
You know what? After what you pulled,
you can do that alone. And quick.

34
00:05:07,694 --> 00:05:10,353
Your cousins get here any minute.
Yeah, Roger?

35
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:14,309
- It's a Christmas cluster-eff over here.
- Beth, help me hang this.

36
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:19,986
Wait. Mom, aren't we
gonna watch Charlie Brown?

37
00:05:27,405 --> 00:05:30,227
<i>Have you finished the letter?</i>

38
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:36,170
I started, but... I don't know
what to ask for this year.

39
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,224
Because they are family, Beth.
And it's only for a few days.

40
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:43,793
Well, I'm not sharing my room
with girls who pee standing up.

41
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:46,586
<i>I'm sure you will think of something.</i>

42
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:49,153
Last year I found shit in my bed, Mom.

43
00:05:49,253 --> 00:05:52,173
- Human shit.
- For the last time, that was their dog!

44
00:05:52,273 --> 00:05:54,439
"They're why some people
shouldn't be allowed to breed!"

45
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:59,085
- Your words, Mom, not mine!
- I never said that!

46
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:04,082
I said maybe they should have to take
a test before they're allowed to breed.

47
00:06:27,507 --> 00:06:29,541
Thanks, Omi.

48
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:33,239
Omi?

49
00:06:34,448 --> 00:06:37,415
Do you still really believe in Santa?

50
00:06:38,215 --> 00:06:40,063
<i>Naturally.</i>

51
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:45,989
<i>But... I also believe St. Nicholas
is what you make of him.</i>

52
00:06:46,826 --> 00:06:48,694
What do you mean?

53
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:54,437
<i>That to believe in him is...
to believe in the true spirit of the holiday.</i>

54
00:06:54,537 --> 00:06:57,986
<i>The spirit of giving. Of sacrifice...</i>

55
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:10,696
<i>I also believe in dessert before dinner.</i>

56
00:07:20,694 --> 00:07:23,497
Yeah, my cousins are crawling out
of the shallow end of the gene pool,

57
00:07:23,597 --> 00:07:25,566
so everyone's a little on edge.

58
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:29,236
- <i>Your mom popping Xanax again?</i>
- Like candy.

59
00:07:29,336 --> 00:07:33,774
Tonight we're making a Japanese
snowflake tree or some crap.

60
00:07:34,474 --> 00:07:37,511
Takes a lot of work to make our family look
more awesome than it actually is, you know?

61
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:41,348
<i>I like snowflakes,
but I like my plan a lot better.</i>

62
00:07:42,548 --> 00:07:45,019
Very enticing.

63
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:47,635
- But I think I'm stuck here.
- <i>Come on.</i>

64
00:07:47,855 --> 00:07:51,925
<i>People have escaped from Alcatraz before,
and I'm only four blocks away.</i>

65
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:56,373
<i>What? What's wrong?</i>

66
00:07:56,473 --> 00:07:57,997
Everything.

67
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:08,373
Crap.

68
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:16,517
- Will you two knock it off?
- Howie, stop ringing the doorbell!

69
00:08:16,617 --> 00:08:19,787
- Well, carry something!
- Help me with the bags.

70
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:23,824
It's Christmas. It's Christmas.
It's Christmas.

71
00:08:24,424 --> 00:08:27,728
- Merry Christmas!
- Hey, sis. Merry Christmas.

72
00:08:27,828 --> 00:08:31,399
- Gosh. I'm so glad you guys could make it.
- Oh, you have no idea.

73
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:35,336
Accidents all over the freeways and nothing
but crazy talk radio for six hours.

74
00:08:35,436 --> 00:08:37,738
We brought you a little taste
of home, though, didn't we?

75
00:08:37,838 --> 00:08:40,832
Well... thank you. It looks...

76
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:42,341
- Wow!
- You're welcome.

77
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:45,205
Linda, move it, move it. We don't have
to keep the traffic jam going.

78
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:47,415
Howard, let me help you with that.

79
00:08:47,515 --> 00:08:49,216
That's...

80
00:08:49,316 --> 00:08:51,585
- Thanks, Tommy.
- Sorry about that.

81
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:53,387
What, you give the Butler
the night off, did you?

82
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:56,791
- Don't worry about it.
- Yeah, we brought Rosie.

83
00:08:56,891 --> 00:09:00,832
- You don't have a cat, do you?
- It's fine. It's fine, right? It's fine.

84
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:02,669
Merry Christmas, girls. Come on in.

85
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:05,693
Don't you look cute
in your matching jackets.

86
00:09:05,793 --> 00:09:09,036
They're just a little cranky
'cause the Steelers lost, so...

87
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:13,838
Jordan, Stevie, why don't you tell your Aunt
Sarah about your presidential fitness award?

88
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,211
It's a good story.

89
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:20,181
Hey, Howie.

90
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:23,517
So, what did you ask Santa for this year?

91
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:25,669
Really nice. They did look pretty good.

92
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:28,622
- It looks bigger in here.
- Toy car?

93
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:30,524
Look what Max has got in his pocket.

94
00:09:30,624 --> 00:09:32,726
A letter to Santa.

95
00:09:33,426 --> 00:09:35,496
Video games?

96
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:38,761
Phone?

97
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:41,533
Dialysis?

98
00:09:43,403 --> 00:09:46,311
- That's a long fucking drive.
- Thank you, guys.

99
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:49,176
Where do you want this stuff, Tom?
Just anywhere?

100
00:09:49,476 --> 00:09:52,513
Christ on a stick.
Would it kill you to shovel your walk?

101
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:54,582
I could have broken a hip out there.

102
00:09:54,782 --> 00:09:58,018
Surprise! Please don't be mad.

103
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,090
Aunt Dorothy. It's so great to see you.

104
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,293
Yeah, well, your sister's
no Mother Teresa,

105
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:09,296
but at least she swings by
every once in a while

106
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:11,632
to make sure that I'm not dead.

107
00:10:11,732 --> 00:10:15,469
So, where's the nog? I need to get merry.

108
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:18,055
It's in the kitchen. Help yourself.

109
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:19,941
- Oh, Tom, let me take that.
- I'm sorry.

110
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,910
- That's okay. That's okay.
- Lord Almighty.

111
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,346
Looks like Martha Stewart
threw up in here.

112
00:10:25,446 --> 00:10:29,950
- We left the door open. Sorry about that.
- We're such a mess, honestly.

113
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,516
Six hours, I mean, come on.

114
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:36,388
Sorry. Wasn't there another...

115
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:40,261
- Child?
- Chrissy! Darn it!

116
00:10:40,461 --> 00:10:42,430
Jordan, I told you to bring her inside.

117
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,565
- Not my kid.
- Come on, girls.

118
00:10:44,665 --> 00:10:47,235
Tommy, help me get the baby
and the rest of the girl crap out.

119
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:51,871
- Do you mind? Thank you.
- Let's make some memories?

120
00:10:52,127 --> 00:10:55,094
Thank you, honey. Thank you.
Oh, my goodness.

121
00:10:55,194 --> 00:10:58,812
A holiday roast is a surprise.
Hemorrhoids are a surprise.

122
00:10:58,912 --> 00:11:01,682
She is a goddamn nightmare.
What were you thinking?

123
00:11:01,782 --> 00:11:05,152
Come on, she's not that bad. She's not!

124
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:07,231
Besides, she tricked me, okay?

125
00:11:07,331 --> 00:11:10,457
I thought we were just dropping off gifts,
and she came to the door with a suitcase.

126
00:11:10,557 --> 00:11:12,926
What was I supposed to do, tell her
she has to spend Christmas by herself?

127
00:11:13,026 --> 00:11:15,802
No, but at least you could have
warned me when one of your mistakes

128
00:11:15,902 --> 00:11:20,234
- is gonna become my problem.
- You think everything I do is a mistake.

129
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:23,103
- Well...
- Sorry. Look out. Look out.

130
00:11:23,203 --> 00:11:26,093
Hey, honey. I think this warhead's armed.

131
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:30,945
You're so stinky. Okay, I'm gonna
go change her. Let's go this way.

132
00:11:31,045 --> 00:11:34,092
Just set that up wherever you want, T.

133
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:37,002
The whole truck smells like shit.

134
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:40,601
So, what's for dinner?

135
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,589
That's my boy!

136
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:59,173
- That's my boy!
- It sure is.

137
00:11:59,273 --> 00:12:01,208
I'm getting Howie Junior into game shape.

138
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:05,746
By the time he gets to high school, he's
gonna be the biggest lineman in the state.

139
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:09,316
Did you ever spend any time
on the field, Tommy?

140
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:13,254
No, actually, I didn't have time in my
younger years. I was in training mostly.

141
00:12:13,354 --> 00:12:18,122
What were you training for? Army? Marines?

142
00:12:18,658 --> 00:12:21,562
- It was the Eagle Scouts.
- Eagle Scouts.

143
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:25,462
Now, Eagle Scouts, kids,
that's where you weave baskets

144
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:28,338
and help little old ladies
across the street. Am I right?

145
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:30,263
No, no.

146
00:12:30,363 --> 00:12:34,391
No, no, no. It was actually quite
a bit of... survival training.

147
00:12:35,609 --> 00:12:39,046
Well, the only survival training
I need is my old smoke pole

148
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:42,650
and a big, fat box of buckshot
that I keep out in that truck.

149
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,619
A shepherd has got to protect his flock.

150
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,289
Honey, we said no gun talk
at the dinner table.

151
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:53,655
This family needs a little gun talk, whether
it's at the dinner table or anywhere else.

152
00:12:53,755 --> 00:12:54,835
You know what I'm saying?

153
00:12:54,935 --> 00:12:57,998
Looks like Chrissy's
really enjoying my gravlax.

154
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:02,603
Careful. Remember that your Aunt Sarah
likes everything to be clean and perfect,

155
00:13:02,703 --> 00:13:06,040
and that's why she makes so much
food that you can't pronounce.

156
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,643
I just thought you guys might like a break
from macaroni and cheese with hot dogs.

157
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:12,613
- Yeah, okay.
- Well, you were wrong.

158
00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:17,082
And who doesn't make a ham at Christmas?
What are you now, a Jew?

159
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,971
Maybe it's time for dessert?

160
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:26,360
- It's delicious, honey.
- It's a little dry.

161
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,743
Okay. Well, mine's delicious.

162
00:13:31,363 --> 00:13:34,539
- I guess I should have gotten your bird.
- You could just say something nice.

163
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:37,071
I'll say it when she gets back
if dessert's good.

164
00:13:37,171 --> 00:13:39,451
- If you could just do me a favor.
- Tell him about Santa.

165
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:43,618
- Just say something nice about dessert.
- Hey. Maxi-pad.

166
00:13:43,718 --> 00:13:45,680
Hear what happened to Santa?

167
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,665
No, Stevie. What happened to Santa?

168
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:51,352
Heard it on the news.
His sleigh crashed in the rockies.

169
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:53,821
Shattered both his legs.

170
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:56,590
Frostbite took care of his pain
but not his hunger.

171
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:01,459
So, to survive, he had to slaughter
and eat his reindeer.

172
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:05,231
Including Rudolph.

173
00:14:05,331 --> 00:14:08,679
"Ate" tiny reindeer. Get it?

174
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,107
- Knock it off!
- Don't start anything.

175
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:17,975
- Hey, guys, take it easy.
- They're just playing, Tommy.

176
00:14:22,081 --> 00:14:26,987
Macaroni and cheese
and hot dogs. Oh, Jesus.

177
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:30,808
So what kind of godforsaken concoction
are you whipping up now?

178
00:14:30,908 --> 00:14:34,244
You know how this fancy food
clogs my pipes.

179
00:14:34,344 --> 00:14:37,381
Well, how about we go to your trailer
for Christmas next year?

180
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:41,618
And after you spent weeks
decorating and cooking and cleaning,

181
00:14:41,718 --> 00:14:43,387
I might just waddle in
and start bitching and moaning

182
00:14:43,487 --> 00:14:45,289
about everything you've worked so hard on.

183
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:48,125
- Sarah, you know...
- No, Aunt Dorothy, please.

184
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:52,727
For your sake, just...
stay the hell out of my kitchen.

185
00:14:55,865 --> 00:14:58,969
You know, reindeer are actually
a sustainable food source

186
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:01,972
in the northern territories,
in Alaska, Canada.

187
00:15:02,072 --> 00:15:05,951
This time of year, we refer to reindeer as

188
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:08,877
a transportation system for Santa Claus.

189
00:15:09,846 --> 00:15:12,966
We know you still believe
in the big, fat creeper.

190
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:15,068
I don't know what you're talking about.

191
00:15:16,188 --> 00:15:18,246
You sure about that?

192
00:15:18,954 --> 00:15:20,588
Max, stop.

193
00:15:22,058 --> 00:15:24,157
"Dear Santa,

194
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,664
I know I haven't been great
this year, and I'm sorry for that,

195
00:15:27,764 --> 00:15:31,868
but I was really hoping you could help
out me and my family this Christmas.

196
00:15:31,968 --> 00:15:35,081
We need you."
Oh, Maxi-pad, that's so sweet.

197
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:37,441
- Give it back!
- Stop, Max.

198
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:41,900
Blah, blah, blah, bullshit, bullshit.
Here we go... Maxi's wish list.

199
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,882
- Stevie, stop. That's enough.
- Wait, you're up first, Beth.

200
00:15:44,982 --> 00:15:48,619
"I wish me and Beth could
hang out like we used to.

201
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:51,622
You might have noticed
that I don't have tons of friends."

202
00:15:51,722 --> 00:15:54,291
Oh, no, really, Max?

203
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:57,855
"I wish my mom and dad
could fall in love again.

204
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:02,299
I know they get upset a lot,
with Dad away from home so much.

205
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,900
I think they really just miss each other."

206
00:16:06,803 --> 00:16:13,213
"Also, I wish things weren't so hard
for Uncle Howard and Aunt Linda.

207
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:19,114
So maybe you can lend them
a hand the rest of the year too.

208
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,936
And...

209
00:16:24,036 --> 00:16:27,925
And that..." screw you.
Dad does not wish we were boys.

210
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:31,877
Okay, who wants crème brûlée?

211
00:16:35,197 --> 00:16:39,503
- Give me the letter! Give it back!
- Hey, Max. Hey. Hey!

212
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:42,605
- Hey!
- Girls!

213
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:47,277
- Hey!
- Hey!

214
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:51,682
- Come on, Howard. Stevie, Jordan.
- All right, all right, that's enough.

215
00:16:51,782 --> 00:16:55,085
- Are you okay? Honey?
- Enough. Enough.

216
00:16:55,535 --> 00:16:59,153
I just wanted Christmas to be like it used
to be, but forget it. I hate Christmas!

217
00:16:59,403 --> 00:17:03,226
- I hate all of you!
- Max. Max!

218
00:17:03,926 --> 00:17:08,063
Oh, lay off of him. Kid deserves
a prize just for telling the truth.

219
00:17:18,141 --> 00:17:21,178
- Can I come in?
- No.

220
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:25,077
You know, they're leaving
right after Christmas,

221
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:29,252
so we only have to survive
another... three days.

222
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:32,222
I don't get it. Every year it gets worse.

223
00:17:32,322 --> 00:17:35,957
Why do we have to put up with their
crap just because we share DNA?

224
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:41,298
Because that's what a family is, Max.

225
00:17:41,398 --> 00:17:43,266
People you try to be friends with

226
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:45,769
even though you don't have
a whole lot in common.

227
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:48,984
- But why?
- Because.

228
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:50,982
Well...

229
00:17:51,941 --> 00:17:54,643
Okay, you kind of got me there.

230
00:17:56,113 --> 00:17:57,188
Or...

231
00:17:57,288 --> 00:18:00,975
maybe it makes us work a little harder to
find what we do have in common, you know.

232
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:04,651
Put everything aside,
think of other people for a change.

233
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:07,457
Friends, family,

234
00:18:07,557 --> 00:18:09,826
even the assholes
you normally can't stand.

235
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:13,462
- Like Uncle Howard?
- Didn't wanna name names.

236
00:18:15,197 --> 00:18:19,033
Dad, do you really believe in all that?

237
00:18:19,134 --> 00:18:21,570
I want to, Max.

238
00:18:23,939 --> 00:18:26,042
But, hey,

239
00:18:26,142 --> 00:18:29,544
bet there's still time to drop
that letter in the mailbox?

240
00:20:26,595 --> 00:20:29,800
Don't you find it the least bit strange?
They can see dust specks on Mars,

241
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,803
but no one noticed a giant blizzard
hurtling towards us.

242
00:20:32,903 --> 00:20:34,705
Well, as soon as the power's back,

243
00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:37,708
you can write an angry e-mail
to the National Weather Service.

244
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:39,977
But in the meantime,
let's just try and stay calm.

245
00:20:40,077 --> 00:20:42,513
- Mom, there's something weird outside.
- I am calm.

246
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:46,021
I would just be calmer if I knew how we were
gonna survive Christmas with 12 people

247
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:49,953
stuck in a house with no hot water,
no heat and no electricity.

248
00:20:50,053 --> 00:20:54,457
- Or food.
- Well, there's plenty of leftovers, Howard.

249
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:57,811
- Beer it is.
- Phone's dead too.

250
00:20:57,911 --> 00:20:59,129
- Mom!
- What, Max?

251
00:20:59,229 --> 00:21:01,835
There's a snowman in our yard.

252
00:21:02,964 --> 00:21:04,833
See?

253
00:21:06,668 --> 00:21:10,390
- That's... that's great, Max.
- But who built it?

254
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,712
You can barely see across the street,
but it doesn't look like it's just us.

255
00:21:15,312 --> 00:21:18,849
- I can walk over, check with the Turners.
- The Turners are in Hawaii.

256
00:21:18,949 --> 00:21:21,551
The Lamberts are in Florida,
and the Cartwrights stopped talking to us

257
00:21:21,651 --> 00:21:25,222
- after Max's noodle incident.
- After his what?

258
00:21:25,322 --> 00:21:29,658
Please go and get Omi out of the fireplace
before she burns the whole house down.

259
00:21:31,861 --> 00:21:34,965
- I'll get it!
- Fine.

260
00:21:35,265 --> 00:21:37,816
Seriously, what are we gonna do?

261
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:41,722
- Merry Christmas. Sign here.
- Yeah.

262
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:46,973
Honey, stuff to carry! Some weather?

263
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:50,347
Yeah. It's a ghost town out there.
Roads are a nightmare.

264
00:21:50,447 --> 00:21:53,449
Yeah, no kidding. Hey, these too?

265
00:21:53,942 --> 00:21:56,502
Not mine. Must be from the boys in Brown.

266
00:21:56,602 --> 00:21:57,895
- All right.
- Merry Christmas.

267
00:21:57,995 --> 00:21:59,823
Yeah, you too.

268
00:22:00,381 --> 00:22:02,459
- What is it?
- Hey, look at this?

269
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,148
- What?
- They got more stuff.

270
00:22:05,248 --> 00:22:07,184
How come rich people
get all the free shit?

271
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,819
I don't know, honey. Democrats, probably.

272
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,354
Oh, my God!

273
00:22:15,258 --> 00:22:17,407
Who needs this much cheese?

274
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:19,643
One singular moment.

275
00:22:19,743 --> 00:22:23,026
I've texted Derek, like, nine times
and he still hasn't written back.

276
00:22:23,126 --> 00:22:24,514
That is not normal.

277
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:26,983
It's the blizzard, honey.
Nothing's working right now.

278
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:30,120
Can I walk over and check on him?
It's only a few blocks.

279
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,489
I don't think that's a good idea.

280
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:35,039
I could see if anyone else
has power on the way.

281
00:22:35,139 --> 00:22:37,560
She'll be fine.

282
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,558
Okay. One hour.

283
00:22:39,663 --> 00:22:42,799
When you get back, I want you to spend
some girl time with Jordan and Stevie.

284
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:44,067
Got it?

285
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:48,405
You call that a reversal?
Come on, Jordy, plant your feet!

286
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:50,607
- Plant your feet. All right.
- Right.

287
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:53,476
- You know what I mean.
- Thanks.

288
00:22:53,576 --> 00:22:56,479
- Be careful, okay?
- Okay. Back later.

289
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:59,282
Love you. One hour.

290
00:22:59,382 --> 00:23:01,249
Okay.

291
00:23:03,152 --> 00:23:06,654
Max, I told you to get Omi out of the...

292
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:20,801
She says hot chocolate
makes everything better.

293
00:24:41,449 --> 00:24:42,951
Oh, my God.

294
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:52,293
Please!

295
00:24:57,366 --> 00:24:59,450
Somebody help me!

296
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,721
Please! Daddy!

297
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:08,627
Help!

298
00:27:27,982 --> 00:27:29,985
Get anything?

299
00:27:30,085 --> 00:27:31,953
No.

300
00:27:33,355 --> 00:27:38,259
It's the weirdest thing. There's no cars,
no people, not even a salt truck.

301
00:27:39,661 --> 00:27:43,241
Don't suppose you got me a backup
generator for Christmas, did you?

302
00:27:43,341 --> 00:27:47,203
Yeah, it's under the tree
next to your ties and underwear.

303
00:27:47,303 --> 00:27:49,170
Good.

304
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:56,146
It's getting late.

305
00:27:56,546 --> 00:28:00,017
- Beth should be home by now.
- She's fine. She's at Derek's.

306
00:28:00,117 --> 00:28:05,720
- All the more reason to worry.
- Hey, hon, relax. Just for once, okay?

307
00:28:08,857 --> 00:28:11,427
How's everybody else doing?

308
00:28:11,527 --> 00:28:16,966
You know, cranky, bored, sick of the snow.

309
00:28:17,066 --> 00:28:19,368
- And each other.
- 'Tis the season.

310
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:27,582
Oh, God, I miss us.

311
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,912
Me too.

312
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,823
Mom, Dad.

313
00:28:42,658 --> 00:28:44,993
It's already dark out
and Beth isn't back yet.

314
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:55,338
Hey, Howard. Do you think your Hummer
could get through this mess?

315
00:28:55,438 --> 00:28:58,942
Lucinda? I could point her
due east, hit the gas

316
00:28:59,042 --> 00:29:03,083
and she'd be storming the beaches at
Normandy by sunrise. What's on your mind, T?

317
00:29:03,183 --> 00:29:07,317
Well, it's Beth. She went to her boyfriend's
earlier and she hasn't come back yet.

318
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:12,388
See? Let them out of your sight for one
second, and boom, shotgun wedding.

319
00:29:12,488 --> 00:29:16,209
- Aunt Dorothy, please.
- Well, you ought to know.

320
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:20,296
It's probably nothing,
but I thought we'd go pick her up,

321
00:29:20,396 --> 00:29:23,066
take a quick swing around town,
see what's going on out there.

322
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:26,002
A little recon mission?
Thought you'd never ask.

323
00:29:26,602 --> 00:29:28,566
- Okay.
- Go to mama.

324
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,089
- Yep.
- All righty.

325
00:29:30,189 --> 00:29:32,631
Thomas. Thomas.

326
00:29:35,153 --> 00:29:39,213
- What? Why?
- What the hell is she so riled up about?

327
00:29:43,051 --> 00:29:44,821
She says not to go.

328
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:47,123
That it's too dangerous, and that we
should wait until the storm's over.

329
00:29:47,223 --> 00:29:49,807
- Tom.
- No, I got this. Hey, Mom...

330
00:29:49,907 --> 00:29:54,398
we have to go pick up Beth, but Max and
Sarah will take care of you while I'm gone.

331
00:29:54,498 --> 00:29:56,331
Mom. Hey, Mom, listen.

332
00:30:00,702 --> 00:30:03,170
Everything's gonna be okay.

333
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:27,285
Global warming, my ass.

334
00:30:27,385 --> 00:30:29,766
Must be negative 20 out here.

335
00:30:29,866 --> 00:30:31,868
This just doesn't make any sense.

336
00:30:31,968 --> 00:30:35,306
- You try AM?
- Yeah, I tried everything.

337
00:30:35,406 --> 00:30:38,640
The storm probably knocked out
the radio stations too.

338
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,190
I guess so.

339
00:30:41,129 --> 00:30:45,079
What I wouldn't give for a little
Bing Crosby right about now.

340
00:30:51,507 --> 00:30:54,656
All right, slow down. What is that?

341
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:07,334
Is that a snowplow?

342
00:31:16,594 --> 00:31:18,429
Hello?

343
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,456
Christ.

344
00:31:43,906 --> 00:31:46,609
Poor bastard must have
sailed clear through.

345
00:31:47,284 --> 00:31:49,545
Looks more like the opposite.

346
00:31:49,845 --> 00:31:51,347
What do you mean?

347
00:31:51,447 --> 00:31:54,135
The glass is punched in.

348
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:09,698
We got to find Beth.

349
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:16,272
You packed guns on Christmas.

350
00:32:16,372 --> 00:32:19,340
Always be prepared, boy scout.

351
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:23,062
- It's kind of heavy.
- Yeah.

352
00:32:23,662 --> 00:32:25,947
It's Linda's.

353
00:32:37,025 --> 00:32:39,093
Oh, my gosh.

354
00:32:39,828 --> 00:32:42,231
You had Mom's angel this whole time?

355
00:32:42,331 --> 00:32:46,234
- Yeah. I thought you knew.
- No.

356
00:32:49,572 --> 00:32:51,911
Remember we used to fight
over who got to place her?

357
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:56,212
Yeah. You fought dirty.
I think I still have the scars.

358
00:32:56,512 --> 00:32:59,213
Where do you think my girls get it from?

359
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:07,455
You saved everything.

360
00:33:07,555 --> 00:33:09,358
Yeah.

361
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:12,960
I figured that's what Mom
would have done, you know.

362
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:25,407
Mom?

363
00:33:28,543 --> 00:33:32,514
- Probably just squirrels.
- In this weather?

364
00:34:01,476 --> 00:34:03,445
See?

365
00:34:03,545 --> 00:34:07,896
- Squirrels.
- Right. Probably playing with their nuts.

366
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:26,922
Beth?

367
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:36,144
Derek!

368
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,795
- Beth!
- Quiet, Tommy. I don't like this.

369
00:35:05,173 --> 00:35:09,243
Whoever did this
is a demented son of a bitch.

370
00:35:17,952 --> 00:35:20,622
Don't worry. We'll find her, buddy.

371
00:35:31,332 --> 00:35:34,034
Looks like a gas line blew.

372
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:45,680
What's that?

373
00:35:49,617 --> 00:35:52,193
I've hunted a lot of game in my day.

374
00:35:52,293 --> 00:35:55,374
Those are hooves. Big ones too.

375
00:35:55,824 --> 00:35:58,027
Could be an elk or a goat.

376
00:35:58,127 --> 00:36:01,629
What kind of goat walks on its hind legs?

377
00:36:07,535 --> 00:36:09,336
Beth!

378
00:36:10,605 --> 00:36:13,397
- Beth!
- Help me!

379
00:36:13,942 --> 00:36:15,743
Beth!

380
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,182
Beth!

381
00:36:23,084 --> 00:36:24,919
Beth!

382
00:36:26,154 --> 00:36:28,324
- Beth!
- Tommy!

383
00:36:28,824 --> 00:36:30,859
Wait up!

384
00:36:40,502 --> 00:36:41,970
Howard!

385
00:36:47,909 --> 00:36:50,813
- Oh, my God!
- Hold on, Howard!

386
00:36:50,913 --> 00:36:54,281
Help! Oh, God! Help me!

387
00:36:56,552 --> 00:36:58,197
Tommy!

388
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,807
Something... something's biting me!

389
00:37:01,907 --> 00:37:03,408
Don't let go!

390
00:37:09,597 --> 00:37:10,766
Tommy?

391
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:24,797
- Let's go!
- What was that thing?

392
00:37:24,897 --> 00:37:27,764
I don't know, but we have to move!

393
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:37,191
Oh, my God.

394
00:37:40,194 --> 00:37:42,697
Lucinda!

395
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:48,721
- Where do you think you're going?
- To find them. I don't like this.

396
00:37:49,071 --> 00:37:52,057
What are you talking about? Tom and Howard
know what they're doing. They're fine.

397
00:37:52,157 --> 00:37:54,186
- Are they?
- Mom?

398
00:37:54,476 --> 00:37:57,446
Honey, I'll be right back.
I promise. Just lock the...

399
00:37:57,546 --> 00:37:58,765
Oh, God!

400
00:37:58,865 --> 00:38:01,433
Max, get the first aid kit!
Sarah, lock the door!

401
00:38:01,537 --> 00:38:04,565
Girls! Make some room for your dad!

402
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:07,376
- Shut the door!
- Where's Beth? We heard gunshots!

403
00:38:07,756 --> 00:38:10,709
I'll explain everything, but right now
everybody just needs to stay calm

404
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:13,196
- and stay inside!
- And get away from the windows!

405
00:38:13,296 --> 00:38:16,031
Swords, guns, knives, pots, pans!
Get whatever you can...

406
00:38:16,131 --> 00:38:17,519
- Howard!
- What?

407
00:38:17,933 --> 00:38:19,934
Not here.

408
00:38:21,135 --> 00:38:24,067
Jiminy Christmas. What happened out there?

409
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:27,810
Nothing. It's just a scratch.

410
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,579
- My God. It looks like something bit you.
- Nope.

411
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:32,882
Probably a bear trap
under the snow or something.

412
00:38:33,232 --> 00:38:35,465
We don't have bears here.

413
00:38:37,785 --> 00:38:39,588
Okay.

414
00:38:39,888 --> 00:38:42,558
Kids, why don't you go into the kitchen
and get something to eat now.

415
00:38:42,658 --> 00:38:44,043
You just don't wanna tell us
what's going on here!

416
00:38:44,143 --> 00:38:48,934
- Everybody into the kitchen right now, Max.
- Come on. Let's go. Girls, come on.

417
00:38:50,164 --> 00:38:51,942
Aunt Dorothy,
will you keep an eye on them?

418
00:38:52,042 --> 00:38:55,670
Why me? I never liked kids,
even when I was one.

419
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:01,543
- Please.
- Oh, all right.

420
00:39:01,643 --> 00:39:03,512
All right!

421
00:39:03,612 --> 00:39:07,048
Come on, guys. I'm gonna teach you
how to make peppermint schnapps.

422
00:39:11,202 --> 00:39:16,741
Mom. Mom, will you please go into
the kitchen and help with the kids?

423
00:39:20,933 --> 00:39:23,265
<i>Keep the fire hot.</i>

424
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:27,968
Come here, baby.

425
00:39:29,637 --> 00:39:34,243
See? A little sugar and a little spice...

426
00:39:35,978 --> 00:39:39,313
makes everything nice.

427
00:39:48,323 --> 00:39:51,825
All right. But don't you rat me out.

428
00:39:53,394 --> 00:39:57,084
Who or what did all this?

429
00:39:57,584 --> 00:40:00,021
Your guess is as good as mine.

430
00:40:01,036 --> 00:40:03,305
First I thought it was a gang thing.

431
00:40:03,405 --> 00:40:06,735
But between this and all
the crazy stuff we saw out here,

432
00:40:06,835 --> 00:40:10,079
- it just doesn't add up.
- It could be terrorists, right?

433
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:14,149
Yeah, terrorists. Maybe traded their
suicide vests for rabid snow dogs?

434
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:15,651
Tommy!

435
00:40:15,751 --> 00:40:18,372
- Tom, God!
- Sorry. Sorry.

436
00:40:18,472 --> 00:40:20,354
And...

437
00:40:20,972 --> 00:40:22,941
- Beth?
- Okay.

438
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:26,448
She wasn't at Derek's, but that doesn't mean
anything. She may have found somewhere safe.

439
00:40:26,548 --> 00:40:29,251
- So she's still out there.
- Yes. And we will find her. I promise.

440
00:40:29,351 --> 00:40:31,901
I had to make sure you guys were safe.
I had to get Howard...

441
00:40:32,001 --> 00:40:34,436
I don't care how long it takes, Tom.
We have to keep looking.

442
00:40:34,536 --> 00:40:38,587
- We have to pair up and take turns...
- We can't go back out there! You see this?

443
00:40:38,697 --> 00:40:42,211
- It's damn near frostbite in under four minutes!
- Honey, keep your voice down.

444
00:40:42,311 --> 00:40:44,180
Besides it being subzero out there,

445
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,783
someone's tearing through your fancy-ass
neighborhood picking everybody off.

446
00:40:47,883 --> 00:40:49,757
- It's the truth!
- Honey...

447
00:40:49,857 --> 00:40:51,620
Listen, why don't we just leave? Right?

448
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,490
We can all pile in the truck and we'll
just see as far as we can get and...

449
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:58,494
- The truck's gone. Torn to pieces.
- What?

450
00:40:58,594 --> 00:41:01,597
Yeah. And even if she wasn't,
the streets are totally screwed.

451
00:41:01,697 --> 00:41:04,433
We can't go anywhere.
It's too dangerous. You got it?

452
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:07,369
Howard, how much ammo do you have?

453
00:41:07,469 --> 00:41:11,306
A couple shells still loaded,
maybe a dozen in my pocket. Why?

454
00:41:11,506 --> 00:41:14,409
I think our best bet is to stay put.

455
00:41:14,509 --> 00:41:17,076
Board up all the doors and windows.

456
00:41:17,176 --> 00:41:19,440
And as soon as the weather breaks,
we'll go find her.

457
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,114
I told you we should've gone
to my brother's.

458
00:41:21,214 --> 00:41:24,328
- Sure, Howard. Christmas on a pig farm.
- Jesus was born in a barn!

459
00:41:24,428 --> 00:41:27,166
Knock it off! What about the kids?
What are we gonna tell them?

460
00:41:27,266 --> 00:41:30,392
- I don't know. The truth?
- Sure. Which version of it?

461
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:33,212
- Hey, you guys.
- Oh, God.

462
00:41:33,312 --> 00:41:36,799
- How much did you hear?
- Enough.

463
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:39,883
- Mama, did someone take Beth?
- Are they coming for us?

464
00:41:39,983 --> 00:41:41,899
No. No, babies, no.

465
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:45,491
Everything's fine. Beth's just
with her boyfriend, that's all.

466
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:48,244
And nothing bad's gonna happen
on Christmas, right?

467
00:41:48,444 --> 00:41:51,313
You know what? Let's have a campout, okay?
We'll watch a movie. Yeah?

468
00:41:51,413 --> 00:41:55,280
Let's get cozy on the couch. Go get
your sister. Come on, baby. Come on.

469
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,018
We'll find her, I promise.

470
00:42:02,792 --> 00:42:05,861
<i>"And lo, the angel
of the Lord came upon them.</i>

471
00:42:06,161 --> 00:42:08,931
<i>And the glory of the Lord
shone round about them.</i>

472
00:42:09,031 --> 00:42:12,699
<i>And they were so afraid.
And the angel said unto them...</i>

473
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:15,504
<i>'fear not. For behold, I bring
you tidings of great joy.'"</i>

474
00:42:15,604 --> 00:42:18,040
Won't the battery die?

475
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:22,475
Got to die sometime.
Might as well enjoy it while we can.

476
00:42:26,414 --> 00:42:27,950
Hey.

477
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,752
Beth's a tough girl.

478
00:42:31,285 --> 00:42:33,655
Takes after her Mom.

479
00:42:34,255 --> 00:42:36,320
I'm sure she's fine.

480
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,492
Thank you.

481
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:48,936
Hey, Tommy. I...

482
00:42:51,606 --> 00:42:55,744
I just wanna say thanks for... you know,

483
00:42:55,844 --> 00:42:58,307
saving my ass back there.

484
00:42:58,407 --> 00:43:00,875
Oh. Well...

485
00:43:00,975 --> 00:43:03,750
sure. No problem.

486
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:12,292
And I just wanna say I'm sorry for...

487
00:43:13,094 --> 00:43:16,663
thinking you're such
a spineless dick all these years.

488
00:43:18,799 --> 00:43:20,434
Yeah.

489
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:28,126
- You should get some sleep, pal.
- How?

490
00:43:28,226 --> 00:43:29,714
Good point.

491
00:43:34,448 --> 00:43:36,199
Hey, Dad.

492
00:43:36,799 --> 00:43:39,053
Are we gonna die?

493
00:43:39,153 --> 00:43:42,121
Hey. No, no.

494
00:43:43,007 --> 00:43:44,874
No.

495
00:43:46,393 --> 00:43:48,828
Omi's been acting different.

496
00:43:49,096 --> 00:43:51,066
Ever since the storm.

497
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:53,541
Yeah, well, you know...

498
00:43:56,837 --> 00:43:59,973
She always gets a little weird
around Christmas.

499
00:44:00,908 --> 00:44:01,943
How come?

500
00:44:02,043 --> 00:44:05,012
I don't know. She never
wanted to talk about it.

501
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:08,249
Max, come on. Time for bed.

502
00:44:09,633 --> 00:44:11,402
It's going to be fine.

503
00:44:17,925 --> 00:44:19,460
All right.

504
00:44:33,974 --> 00:44:37,911
You know, Linda and I,
we butt heads, but...

505
00:44:38,646 --> 00:44:41,781
I can't imagine life without her.

506
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:46,252
Yeah, I know what you mean.

507
00:44:46,555 --> 00:44:49,656
One of us should probably
stay up and keep watch.

508
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:52,681
That's a good idea. I'll go first.

509
00:44:52,781 --> 00:44:55,430
No. You go ahead and catch
some winks with your family.

510
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,199
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

511
00:44:58,966 --> 00:45:02,002
A shepherd has got to protect his flock.

512
00:45:02,937 --> 00:45:05,740
- Night, Howard.
- Good night.

513
00:48:15,062 --> 00:48:18,299
- Howie!
- Dad! Dad!

514
00:48:20,033 --> 00:48:22,569
Hang on, Howie!

515
00:48:22,686 --> 00:48:24,756
Dad! Dad!

516
00:48:25,743 --> 00:48:27,776
Sarah! Hold on, Sarah!

517
00:48:27,876 --> 00:48:30,822
- Mom!
- Call 911!

518
00:48:43,223 --> 00:48:45,288
Hold on!

519
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,037
- Max, get the fire extinguisher!
- Pull!

520
00:48:57,771 --> 00:49:00,276
Help me! Help me!

521
00:49:05,779 --> 00:49:07,848
I got you!

522
00:49:18,225 --> 00:49:19,795
Howie!

523
00:49:19,895 --> 00:49:21,614
Howie!

524
00:49:21,714 --> 00:49:24,327
No, no, no!

525
00:49:33,073 --> 00:49:35,609
Oh, geez.

526
00:49:39,848 --> 00:49:43,421
Honey, are you okay? Are you hurt? Hon?

527
00:49:44,685 --> 00:49:48,123
What... unholy thing was that?

528
00:49:50,858 --> 00:49:53,722
Howard. Howard.

529
00:49:55,195 --> 00:49:56,760
- It's my fault.
- No.

530
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:01,970
I fell asleep, and they got our boy.
It's all my fault.

531
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:03,479
<i>Nein.</i>

532
00:50:12,045 --> 00:50:14,107
Tom, what's she saying?

533
00:50:14,207 --> 00:50:19,587
"This is all of our fault.
He's come for us all?"

534
00:50:19,953 --> 00:50:22,964
He? Who... Who's he?

535
00:50:23,064 --> 00:50:25,360
I don't know.
Mom, what are you talking about?

536
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:29,857
- Please, listen.
- English. I knew it.

537
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:33,023
I must tell you something.

538
00:50:33,123 --> 00:50:35,336
To all of you.

539
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:41,449
It started with the wind.

540
00:50:44,479 --> 00:50:49,016
<i>On a cold winter night, much like this.</i>

541
00:50:49,917 --> 00:50:52,787
<i>It was almost Christmas.</i>

542
00:50:53,487 --> 00:50:56,991
<i>But this Christmas was darker,</i>

543
00:50:57,091 --> 00:50:59,293
<i>less cheerful.</i>

544
00:51:01,428 --> 00:51:05,232
<i>But I still believed in Santa,</i>

545
00:51:05,766 --> 00:51:07,736
<i>in magic,</i>

546
00:51:08,136 --> 00:51:10,472
<i>and miracles</i>

547
00:51:10,972 --> 00:51:15,810
<i>and the hope that we could find joy again.</i>

548
00:51:16,877 --> 00:51:18,947
<i>But our village had given up</i>

549
00:51:19,047 --> 00:51:22,264
<i>on miracles and on each other.</i>

550
00:51:26,019 --> 00:51:29,357
<i>They had forgotten
the spirit of Christmas,</i>

551
00:51:29,457 --> 00:51:32,293
<i>the sacrifice of giving.</i>

552
00:51:34,361 --> 00:51:38,432
<i>And my family was no different.</i>

553
00:51:41,735 --> 00:51:45,106
<i>I tried to help them to believe again,</i>

554
00:51:45,206 --> 00:51:50,377
<i>but we were no longer
the loving family I remembered.</i>

555
00:51:53,313 --> 00:51:56,550
<i>They too had given up.</i>

556
00:51:57,584 --> 00:52:01,522
<i>And eventually, so did I.</i>

557
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:06,394
<i>And for the first time,</i>

558
00:52:06,494 --> 00:52:09,497
<i>I didn't wish for a miracle.</i>

559
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:13,501
<i>I wished for them to go away.</i>

560
00:52:14,268 --> 00:52:18,266
<i>A wish I would come to regret.</i>

561
00:52:20,508 --> 00:52:22,410
<i>And that night,</i>

562
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:26,081
<i>in the darkness of a howling blizzard,</i>

563
00:52:26,181 --> 00:52:29,416
<i>I got my wish.</i>

564
00:52:32,887 --> 00:52:38,459
<i>I knew Saint Nicholas
was not coming this year.</i>

565
00:52:40,761 --> 00:52:43,932
<i>Instead it was a much darker,</i>

566
00:52:44,032 --> 00:52:47,535
<i>more ancient spirit.</i>

567
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:53,608
<i>The shadow of Saint Nicholas.</i>

568
00:52:53,708 --> 00:52:56,710
<i>It was Krampus.</i>

569
00:52:58,245 --> 00:53:02,397
<i>And as he had for thousands of years,</i>

570
00:53:02,497 --> 00:53:06,888
<i>Krampus came not to reward, but to punish.</i>

571
00:53:06,988 --> 00:53:11,792
<i>Not to give, but to take.</i>

572
00:53:12,859 --> 00:53:16,029
<i>He and his helpers.</i>

573
00:53:18,099 --> 00:53:21,640
<i>I could only listen
as they dragged my family</i>

574
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,872
<i>into the underworld,</i>

575
00:53:23,972 --> 00:53:27,909
<i>knowing that I would be next.</i>

576
00:53:29,477 --> 00:53:34,448
<i>But Krampus didn't take me that night.</i>

577
00:53:35,415 --> 00:53:38,119
<i>He left me as a reminder</i>

578
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:42,523
<i>of what happens when hope is lost,</i>

579
00:53:42,623 --> 00:53:45,894
<i>when belief is forgotten</i>

580
00:53:45,994 --> 00:53:50,267
<i>and the Christmas spirit dies.</i>

581
00:54:05,378 --> 00:54:07,415
And here I thought
I was the one losing it.

582
00:54:07,515 --> 00:54:09,717
- Howard.
- What?

583
00:54:09,817 --> 00:54:12,653
- You believe this senile horseshit?
- I don't know.

584
00:54:12,753 --> 00:54:15,990
Evil Santa? Jesus H. Almighty.

585
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:19,127
She'll be yammering about a rabid
easter bunny come spring.

586
00:54:19,227 --> 00:54:21,510
Howard, that's enough.

587
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:26,367
You damn right it's enough.

588
00:54:26,467 --> 00:54:29,437
Whoever the hell's messing with us
took my boy and your daughter,

589
00:54:29,537 --> 00:54:33,789
and we're sitting around listening
to some twisted bedtime story?

590
00:54:36,043 --> 00:54:37,612
Screw that.

591
00:54:37,712 --> 00:54:39,681
- I'm getting Howie back.
- Howard!

592
00:54:39,781 --> 00:54:43,853
- Daddy, don't go!
- Tommy, don't! Don't, Tommy!

593
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:49,774
I'm starting to like you. I am.

594
00:54:50,424 --> 00:54:52,127
But this is my choice.

595
00:54:52,227 --> 00:54:56,713
Howard, what are you doing?
We've got four other kids here to protect.

596
00:54:56,813 --> 00:54:57,710
Howard.

597
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:01,836
Baby, please don't do this. Listen,
we can figure something else out. Honey.

598
00:55:02,136 --> 00:55:06,408
- This is how I figure things out.
- Howard, you don't wanna do this.

599
00:55:06,508 --> 00:55:07,948
Howard.

600
00:55:08,048 --> 00:55:09,793
Howard.

601
00:55:14,681 --> 00:55:17,217
Howie!

602
00:55:21,721 --> 00:55:23,791
Howie.

603
00:55:27,845 --> 00:55:30,882
No, shut the door! Inside! Shut it!

604
00:55:40,006 --> 00:55:42,509
Don't open the door.

605
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:44,913
Dad?

606
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:48,248
What are we gonna do now?

607
00:55:48,348 --> 00:55:51,218
We keep the fire hot.

608
00:56:20,747 --> 00:56:24,753
But what if you've
been good, like, all year?

609
00:56:24,853 --> 00:56:28,755
And you leave out milk and cookies
and do everything else right?

610
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:43,771
"It's not what you do.
It's what you believe.

611
00:56:44,071 --> 00:56:47,608
And what you've given up... in here."

612
00:56:49,242 --> 00:56:51,879
But can't we make him go away?

613
00:56:57,885 --> 00:57:00,790
- What's she saying?
- I'm not sure.

614
00:57:00,899 --> 00:57:03,273
She says we're fucked.

615
00:57:05,792 --> 00:57:07,495
- How did you...
- 'cause I'm old enough to know

616
00:57:07,595 --> 00:57:11,098
when life is coming at you
with his pants down.

617
00:57:29,749 --> 00:57:31,319
Hey.

618
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,291
When they took Howie...

619
00:57:35,391 --> 00:57:37,942
what did you see up there?

620
00:57:39,726 --> 00:57:42,596
You believe that story, right?

621
00:57:43,963 --> 00:57:45,716
Do you?

622
00:57:45,816 --> 00:57:48,348
I don't know what I believe anymore.

623
00:57:48,448 --> 00:57:50,865
I know I'm going out there
to find Beth. I have to.

624
00:57:50,965 --> 00:57:53,576
- I don't even care if I die trying.
- I know. Listen.

625
00:57:53,676 --> 00:57:56,244
Let's get Howard and Linda.
I have an idea.

626
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:51,032
Linda.

627
00:58:51,682 --> 00:58:53,544
Can we talk with you
and Howard for a minute?

628
00:58:53,644 --> 00:58:55,780
Can it wait?

629
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:59,773
I just wanna get these rewrapped
for the kids.

630
00:58:59,873 --> 00:59:01,542
It's important.

631
00:59:01,742 --> 00:59:04,206
- The snowplow?
- The keys were in the ignition,

632
00:59:04,306 --> 00:59:08,316
and it was beat to hell,
but if it runs, I drive it back here,

633
00:59:08,416 --> 00:59:13,347
then everyone piles in the car and follows
while I clear a path in front of us.

634
00:59:13,587 --> 00:59:15,490
And go where?

635
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:17,959
The mall doubles as an emergency shelter.

636
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:20,765
And if it's empty,
we'll try the police station.

637
00:59:21,195 --> 00:59:22,964
And what if they're gone too?

638
00:59:23,064 --> 00:59:27,185
Then we keep driving
till we see lights or people,

639
00:59:27,285 --> 00:59:29,540
plowed road, somewhere safe for the kids.

640
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:33,508
And then we bring help back here.
For Beth and Howie.

641
00:59:33,608 --> 00:59:37,210
You're not thinking of going
for the plow by yourself, are you?

642
00:59:38,678 --> 00:59:42,182
Well, a shepherd's got
to protect his flock.

643
01:00:29,161 --> 01:00:31,632
I can't believe you're afraid
to come up here by yourself.

644
01:00:31,732 --> 01:00:35,335
It's not my fault Aunt Dorothy
clogged up the crapper.

645
01:00:36,469 --> 01:00:38,840
- Hey, Stevie?
- Yeah.

646
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:43,644
Do you think they took Howie
'cause of the time he painted the cats?

647
01:00:43,944 --> 01:00:46,413
I don't know, Jordan.

648
01:00:47,881 --> 01:00:51,272
- Do you think he's dead?
- I don't know.

649
01:00:53,319 --> 01:00:55,422
Jordan?

650
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:58,748
Stevie?

651
01:01:01,594 --> 01:01:03,607
Beth?

652
01:01:03,707 --> 01:01:05,185
Beth, you up there?

653
01:01:05,285 --> 01:01:09,504
Stevie? Jordan? What are you doing?

654
01:01:09,604 --> 01:01:12,740
Where have you been?
Everyone's freaking out.

655
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:17,578
Come up here and I'll show you.
I've been waiting for you guys.

656
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:19,579
Hurry.

657
01:01:20,246 --> 01:01:23,684
- Have you told Max yet?
- No. Not yet.

658
01:01:26,384 --> 01:01:28,823
Jordan? Stevie!

659
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:33,094
Where are they? Where did they go?

660
01:01:33,194 --> 01:01:35,963
They were just here.
I think they went to the bathroom.

661
01:01:36,063 --> 01:01:39,866
- And you just let them go?
- Was there another option?

662
01:01:42,001 --> 01:01:43,671
Jordan! Stevie!

663
01:01:43,771 --> 01:01:45,973
- Linda.
- Jordan.

664
01:01:46,073 --> 01:01:47,943
Listen.

665
01:01:48,543 --> 01:01:50,705
Honey, who is that?

666
01:01:50,805 --> 01:01:52,546
Howard, stay here.

667
01:01:57,517 --> 01:01:59,120
Omi.

668
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,255
I think all this might be my fault.

669
01:02:16,168 --> 01:02:18,416
Uncle Howard?

670
01:02:21,941 --> 01:02:23,793
Rosie.

671
01:02:24,343 --> 01:02:26,369
Come here, girl.

672
01:02:28,281 --> 01:02:30,251
Useless turd.

673
01:02:30,884 --> 01:02:33,953
All right, wait here.

674
01:02:49,502 --> 01:02:51,339
Jordan?

675
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:53,808
Stevie?

676
01:03:13,793 --> 01:03:16,300
- Jordan.
- Stevie?

677
01:03:29,675 --> 01:03:31,978
You guys.

678
01:03:39,686 --> 01:03:42,055
What the hell is this?

679
01:03:48,317 --> 01:03:49,866
Goddamn it.

680
01:03:51,965 --> 01:03:54,968
It's okay. I got you.

681
01:03:55,068 --> 01:03:57,605
You're gonna be okay.

682
01:05:09,592 --> 01:05:11,328
Oh, come on.

683
01:05:15,015 --> 01:05:18,050
Oh, my God!

684
01:05:19,352 --> 01:05:22,054
Oh, my God!

685
01:05:27,095 --> 01:05:30,164
Shoot it, Tom! Shoot it!
For God's sake, shoot it!

686
01:05:35,501 --> 01:05:37,036
Linda!

687
01:05:46,479 --> 01:05:48,215
We should have gone to my brother's.

688
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:06,967
- Where did it go? Oh, my God.
- I don't know!

689
01:06:41,234 --> 01:06:42,795
- Bear!
- What?

690
01:06:42,895 --> 01:06:44,822
Bear!

691
01:07:32,352 --> 01:07:35,153
Got to be kidding me!

692
01:07:44,397 --> 01:07:47,667
- Merry Christmas, mother...
- There he is! Charge!

693
01:08:07,955 --> 01:08:09,790
That's a good girl.

694
01:08:37,316 --> 01:08:40,953
Wha... Stevie? Stevie?

695
01:09:07,413 --> 01:09:11,538
Hey! Give me back my kids, you... fudger!

696
01:09:15,388 --> 01:09:16,990
Jordan!

697
01:09:18,557 --> 01:09:21,161
Stevie. I'm coming, baby.

698
01:09:21,561 --> 01:09:24,231
Stevie. Baby.

699
01:09:24,331 --> 01:09:28,102
It's okay. Mama's here.
Mama's here. There you go.

700
01:09:28,202 --> 01:09:32,556
Mom, it got Jordan.
It was gonna get me next.

701
01:09:35,641 --> 01:09:39,345
Thanks, honey. Are you okay?

702
01:09:53,092 --> 01:09:54,961
What?

703
01:09:55,594 --> 01:09:57,297
Mom!

704
01:09:57,497 --> 01:09:58,932
Max!

705
01:09:59,232 --> 01:10:02,552
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

706
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:04,638
- Max, are you okay?
- Yeah.

707
01:10:04,738 --> 01:10:07,141
- What happened up there?
- They got Jordan.

708
01:10:07,241 --> 01:10:08,810
Who?

709
01:10:15,112 --> 01:10:16,681
Mom?

710
01:10:16,781 --> 01:10:19,153
I think it's panicking,
trying to get outside.

711
01:10:19,553 --> 01:10:22,089
Well, we boarded everything up.

712
01:10:22,389 --> 01:10:24,757
Howard, that's Jordan.

713
01:10:24,857 --> 01:10:27,394
We got to get in there.
We got to get in there and get her out.

714
01:10:27,494 --> 01:10:29,930
What are we dealing with?
What did you see up there?

715
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:31,899
You don't wanna know, sweetheart.

716
01:10:31,999 --> 01:10:36,036
Honey, I just got my ass kicked
by a bunch of Christmas cookies,

717
01:10:36,236 --> 01:10:39,139
so trust me when I say I can take it!

718
01:10:49,615 --> 01:10:52,663
No, no, no. Max, what are you doing?

719
01:10:54,103 --> 01:10:56,373
Go get 'em, girl.

720
01:11:03,995 --> 01:11:06,232
Get 'em, Rosie.

721
01:11:24,583 --> 01:11:26,419
Rosie?

722
01:11:45,105 --> 01:11:47,859
For God's sake, Howard, shoot it!

723
01:11:51,477 --> 01:11:54,147
- Get it off me!
- Dad!

724
01:11:54,247 --> 01:11:57,249
- Howard!
- You bitch!

725
01:12:00,986 --> 01:12:03,356
Get it off me!

726
01:12:07,026 --> 01:12:09,065
Dad!

727
01:12:09,165 --> 01:12:10,996
Omi!

728
01:12:27,413 --> 01:12:30,350
Aunt Dorothy? Finish it.

729
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:32,636
With pleasure.

730
01:12:38,612 --> 01:12:39,706
<i>Elves.</i>

731
01:12:40,741 --> 01:12:42,078
Shit.

732
01:13:23,569 --> 01:13:25,372
- Howard, where's Chrissy?
- I don't know!

733
01:13:25,472 --> 01:13:29,042
Where's the baby?
Honey, where's your sister?

734
01:13:31,471 --> 01:13:33,580
No! No!

735
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:36,887
- No!
- Howard! Howard, the baby!

736
01:13:37,217 --> 01:13:40,285
I'll see you in hell.

737
01:13:41,788 --> 01:13:44,534
Twisted fairy-tale horseshit!

738
01:13:44,634 --> 01:13:46,899
Howard, no!

739
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,364
Great.

740
01:14:20,392 --> 01:14:23,417
Are you okay? Are you okay?

741
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,432
Max, get the ammo.

742
01:14:29,151 --> 01:14:30,333
Where did they go?

743
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:33,383
I'm more worried about when they come back.
We need to make a break for it.

744
01:14:33,483 --> 01:14:36,810
- For what, Tom?
- The snowplow. It's our only shot.

745
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:39,445
And then we're going after 'em.

746
01:14:39,745 --> 01:14:43,050
What is going on? Sarah, what's going on?

747
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:46,740
- Mom, come on. We're leaving.
- You're gonna be okay.

748
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:52,391
Mom! We have to go. Now!

749
01:14:55,594 --> 01:14:57,463
It's him.

750
01:15:07,717 --> 01:15:09,390
Let's go.

751
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:13,212
Max. Max, come, come, come.

752
01:15:13,546 --> 01:15:16,582
Come on. Okay.

753
01:15:17,449 --> 01:15:20,220
- Hurry, hurry.
- Get your gloves on. Put your hood up.

754
01:15:23,955 --> 01:15:25,825
Ready?

755
01:15:30,029 --> 01:15:34,300
Everybody... hold on to each other.

756
01:15:43,491 --> 01:15:44,761
Omi!

757
01:15:45,811 --> 01:15:49,933
- Be good.
- Omi! Omi!

758
01:15:50,033 --> 01:15:52,435
Omi, no!

759
01:15:52,535 --> 01:15:54,554
Omi!

760
01:15:54,654 --> 01:15:56,175
Mom!

761
01:15:56,275 --> 01:15:59,617
Mom, open the door! Mom!

762
01:16:00,017 --> 01:16:03,296
Mom, you open this door now!

763
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:07,309
- The window.
- Dad!

764
01:16:07,409 --> 01:16:12,137
She wants to face him.
She's trying to help.

765
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:19,788
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Go!

766
01:18:38,316 --> 01:18:40,352
Keep moving!

767
01:18:58,605 --> 01:19:01,808
Go! Go! Get behind me. Go.

768
01:19:02,108 --> 01:19:04,244
Go, go, go! Keep moving.

769
01:19:04,544 --> 01:19:06,679
Come on, buddy.

770
01:19:11,249 --> 01:19:12,919
Come on.

771
01:19:24,913 --> 01:19:26,916
You have to go. You have to go.

772
01:19:27,016 --> 01:19:28,368
- I need you to go.
- No.

773
01:19:28,568 --> 01:19:31,638
All of you, you have to go.
Do you understand?

774
01:19:31,738 --> 01:19:34,407
Keep driving. Do you understand?

775
01:19:37,426 --> 01:19:40,563
I love you. I love you, buddy.

776
01:19:42,047 --> 01:19:44,751
Go! Now! Go!

777
01:19:47,485 --> 01:19:49,521
Go!

778
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:57,796
Come on!

779
01:20:19,818 --> 01:20:21,854
Come on.

780
01:20:25,457 --> 01:20:29,629
Keep going. Keep going. God. Get in.
I want you to get up in there.

781
01:20:29,729 --> 01:20:33,432
I want you to get in there.
You stay here. You don't move.

782
01:20:35,168 --> 01:20:38,838
- Okay? You understand?
- Mom! Mom, please!

783
01:20:39,138 --> 01:20:43,009
Sarah! Baby, go with your Aunt Sarah.

784
01:20:44,442 --> 01:20:48,448
Stevie, sweetheart, it's okay.
It's okay. Come on.

785
01:20:48,948 --> 01:20:50,649
Sarah!

786
01:20:50,749 --> 01:20:53,152
Stay here. I'll be right back.

787
01:20:53,529 --> 01:20:55,555
Sarah!

788
01:20:56,505 --> 01:20:58,291
Mom! No!

789
01:20:58,391 --> 01:21:00,827
- Mom! Mom!
- I love you.

790
01:21:00,927 --> 01:21:02,928
Mom!

791
01:21:07,933 --> 01:21:13,344
Max, we got to go. Max, we got to go. Max.

792
01:21:13,922 --> 01:21:15,892
Come on.

793
01:21:17,996 --> 01:21:22,006
It's not starting. It's not starting.
Why isn't it starting? Come on.

794
01:21:22,106 --> 01:21:23,653
- Come on, Max, please.
- I'm trying.

795
01:21:23,983 --> 01:21:27,186
I don't even know how to drive a stick.
We have a hybrid!

796
01:21:27,286 --> 01:21:30,022
Come on! Please!

797
01:22:07,359 --> 01:22:10,905
Max! Max! No! No...

798
01:22:12,798 --> 01:22:15,000
Stevie!

799
01:23:00,012 --> 01:23:04,384
<i>He left me as a reminder of what happens</i>

800
01:23:04,484 --> 01:23:07,621
<i>when hope is lost...</i>

801
01:23:08,321 --> 01:23:11,591
<i>when belief is forgotten...</i>

802
01:23:12,091 --> 01:23:16,362
<i>and the Christmas spirit dies.</i>

803
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:35,181
Help! Help! Help!

804
01:23:35,281 --> 01:23:37,316
Help me!

805
01:23:41,753 --> 01:23:43,789
Max!

806
01:23:54,716 --> 01:23:56,268
Help me!

807
01:24:01,306 --> 01:24:04,709
Hey! Asshole!

808
01:24:16,955 --> 01:24:19,525
I take back my wish!

809
01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:22,094
I take it all back!

810
01:24:25,931 --> 01:24:28,913
Give me back my family!

811
01:25:26,573 --> 01:25:27,809
Max!

812
01:25:30,096 --> 01:25:31,798
Let her go!

813
01:25:32,998 --> 01:25:35,267
Help me!

814
01:25:54,403 --> 01:25:56,254
Please.

815
01:25:56,354 --> 01:25:58,457
I know you can fix this.

816
01:25:58,557 --> 01:26:00,776
Give them back.

817
01:26:02,527 --> 01:26:03,940
Take me instead.

818
01:26:41,633 --> 01:26:44,202
What are you doing? I said, take me.

819
01:26:44,469 --> 01:26:49,363
Take me. What are you doing? Take me! No!

820
01:26:49,775 --> 01:26:51,604
Stevie!

821
01:26:57,515 --> 01:26:59,719
No! Let me go!

822
01:27:00,986 --> 01:27:03,840
No! No! Please!

823
01:27:11,496 --> 01:27:13,299
I'm sorry.

824
01:27:14,532 --> 01:27:17,056
I just wanted Christmas
to be like it used to be.

825
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:23,790
No!

826
01:28:39,234 --> 01:28:41,270
You want down?

827
01:28:43,656 --> 01:28:46,425
This dog didn't keep you guys up?
She likes to bark at night.

828
01:28:46,525 --> 01:28:48,201
She sure does.

829
01:28:48,301 --> 01:28:50,862
Thanks for making pancakes.

830
01:28:56,834 --> 01:28:59,605
About time you got up.
We've been waiting forever.

831
01:28:59,705 --> 01:29:01,574
Oh, hey, there he is. Hey, kiddo.

832
01:29:01,674 --> 01:29:04,609
We thought the sugarplum fairies
may have gotten you.

833
01:29:04,709 --> 01:29:07,982
- You're all alive.
- Barely.

834
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:11,851
I haven't felt this hungover
since the pope died.

835
01:29:11,951 --> 01:29:13,846
What's up, buddy? Are you okay?

836
01:29:13,946 --> 01:29:16,224
Yeah, I just...

837
01:29:17,539 --> 01:29:21,355
Just had a bad dream, I guess.

838
01:29:22,962 --> 01:29:25,565
Enough with the sappy crap.
Let's open up the damn presents.

839
01:29:25,665 --> 01:29:30,248
Okay. Okay, already. Come on, Linda.
Let's do this. You're gonna help me?

840
01:29:31,252 --> 01:29:33,189
Okay.

841
01:29:33,439 --> 01:29:37,008
Merry Christmas, Max.

842
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:45,490
- Stevie, sweetheart.
- Thanks, Mom.

843
01:29:51,013 --> 01:29:52,891
Isn't that fun?

844
01:29:52,991 --> 01:29:56,327
- Hey, Maxi-pad.
- Training batting gloves.

845
01:29:56,528 --> 01:29:58,568
What could that possibly be?

846
01:29:58,668 --> 01:30:01,801
- Oh, my God!
- "Oh, my God" is right.

847
01:30:01,901 --> 01:30:04,871
That's from me and the girls.
I had to reattach the foot.

848
01:30:04,971 --> 01:30:07,442
But, yeah, if you look closely...

849
01:30:07,542 --> 01:30:10,556
he did a really good job
of reattaching it.

850
01:30:14,112 --> 01:30:17,516
- Oh, thank you.
- This is great.

851
01:30:18,016 --> 01:30:20,470
Omi, that's beautiful.

852
01:30:20,570 --> 01:30:25,071
- What's this all about?
- It's nothing. Just...

853
01:30:25,491 --> 01:30:27,359
Merry Christmas.

854
01:30:27,459 --> 01:30:31,434
- Well, merry Christmas to you too, Max.
- Merry Christmas, son.

855
01:30:59,057 --> 01:31:02,228
<i>I just wanted Christmas
to be like it used to be.</i>

856
01:31:02,328 --> 01:31:06,270
- <i>That's what a family is, Max.</i>
- <i>Nothing bad's gonna happen on Christmas.</i>

857
01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:09,652
<i>I just got my ass kicked
by a bunch of Christmas cookies,</i>

858
01:31:09,752 --> 01:31:13,340
- <i>so trust me when I say I can take it!</i>
- <i>...some people shouldn't be allowed to breed!"</i>

859
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:17,026
<i>Do you think they took Howie
'cause of the time he painted the cats?</i>

860
01:31:19,511 --> 01:31:23,250
<i>And as he had for thousands of years,</i>

861
01:31:23,749 --> 01:31:27,982
<i>Krampus came not to reward, but to punish.</i>

862
01:31:28,122 --> 01:31:30,438
<i>Not to give,</i>

863
01:31:30,538 --> 01:31:33,458
<i>but to take.</i>
