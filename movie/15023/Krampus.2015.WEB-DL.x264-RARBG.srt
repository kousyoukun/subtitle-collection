1
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:26,571
<i>I come tonight to warn you that you
will be visited by three spirits.</i>

2
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,274
<i>What?</i>

3
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:33,111
<i>Was that the chance and hope
that you mentioned, Jacob?</i>

4
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,946
<i>It was.</i>

5
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:39,451
<i>You have yet the chance and
hope of escaping my fate.</i>

6
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:44,489
<i>A chance and hope of my procuring,
Ebenezer. Thank you, Jacob.</i>

7
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:50,128
<i>Expect the first
when the bell tolls 1:00.</i>

8
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,265
Shut up, Beth! I don't
care who started it, Max.

9
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,635
Ben Kuklinski started it
and everybody knows it.

10
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,603
We even have the whole
thing on video.

11
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:01,573
You're gonna write an apology to the rest
of your class for ruining the recital.

12
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,175
What were you thinking, Max?
That kid was twice your size.

13
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,178
Yeah, but Ben Kuklinski is
always ragging on Christmas.

14
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,948
He even told the first graders that
Santa was just a cheap marketing ploy

15
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,182
invented to sell Pepsi.

16
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,118
Coke. You know what I mean.

17
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,453
But not why you care.
Well, someone's got to.

18
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,656
Here, let me see.

19
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,157
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

20
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,359
Ah, it's not so bad.
Just keep icing it.

21
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:25,764
And was drop-kicking him into the manger
really the best way to handle this?

22
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,133
Okay, that was not my fault.
I was under the influence.

23
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:31,202
All I had to eat was Christmas
fudge and candy canes.

24
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,339
Well, I hate to sound harsh, but every
kid has to learn the truth someday.

25
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:40,111
Oh, I know. I just...
I didn't want it ruined.

26
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,213
For the little kids.

27
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:46,351
<i>But is this a war on Christmas, a war
on over-political correctness or...</i>

28
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,520
Looks great, mom.

29
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,488
Don't work too hard, though.

30
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,724
Sarah bought a bunch
of cookies at the store.

31
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,492
It's Roger.

32
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,628
Thought you said you weren't
working over Christmas.

33
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,664
I said no traveling over Christmas.
I still have to take a few calls.

34
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,366
Hey, Roger, what's up?

35
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,401
Wait. Guys, aren't we still
gonna watch Charlie brown

36
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,403
and wrap Christmas presents
like always?

37
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,906
You know what? After what you
pulled, you can do that alone.

38
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,475
And quick. Your cousins get
here any minute. Yeah, Roger?

39
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,211
Ah, it's a Christmas
cluster-eff over here.

40
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:14,979
Beth, help me hang this.

41
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,718
Wait. Mom, aren't we
gonna watch Charlie brown?

42
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,068
I started, but... I don't know
what to ask for this year.

43
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,537
Because they are family, Beth.

44
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,272
And it's only for a few days.

45
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:44,743
Well, I'm not sharing my room
with girls who pee standing up.

46
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,081
Last year I found shit
in my bed, mom.

47
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,251
Human shit. For the last
time, that was their dog!

48
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:56,228
"They're why some people
shouldn't be allowed to breed!"

49
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:57,689
Your words, mom, not mine!

50
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,959
I never said that!

51
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:04,362
I said maybe they should have to take a
test before they're allowed to breed.

52
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,621
Thanks, Omi.

53
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:35,126
Omi? Hmm?

54
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,995
Do you still really
believe in Santa?

55
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,474
What do you mean?

56
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,375
Yeah, my cousins are crawling out of
the shallow end of the gene pool,

57
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,644
so everyone's a little on edge.

58
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:30,014
<i>Your mom popping Xanax again?</i>
Like candy.

59
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:34,552
Tonight we're making a Japanese
snowflake tree or some crap.

60
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,989
Takes a lot of work to make our family look
more awesome than it actually is, you know?

61
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,624
<i>I like snowflakes,</i>

62
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,126
<i>but I like my plan a lot better.</i>

63
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,897
Very enticing.

64
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,633
But I think I'm stuck here.
<i>Come on.</i>

65
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:52,003
<i>People have escaped from Alcatraz
before, and I'm only four blocks away.</i>

66
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:55,840
<i>What? What's wrong?</i>

67
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,877
Everything.

68
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,053
Crap.

69
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,495
Will you two knock it off? Howie,
stop ringing the doorbell!

70
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,265
Well, carry something! Howie, cut it out!
Help me with the bags.

71
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:24,702
It's Christmas.
It's Christmas. It's Christmas.

72
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:28,239
Merry Christmas!
Hey, sis. Merry Christmas.

73
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:32,377
Oh, gosh. I'm so glad you guys could
make it. Oh, you have no idea.

74
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:36,214
Accidents all over the freeways and nothing
but crazy talk radio for six hours.

75
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,716
We brought you a little taste
of home, though, didn't we?

76
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:42,720
Oh, wow.
Thank you. It looks... wow.

77
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,255
You're welcome. Linda,
move it, move it.

78
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,190
We don't have to keep
the traffic jam going.

79
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,293
Howard, let me help you
with that.

80
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,094
That's, uh...

81
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,463
- Thanks, Tommy.
- Sorry about that.

82
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,365
What, you give the Butler
the night off, did you?

83
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,769
- Tom, don't worry about it.
- Yeah, we brought Rosie.

84
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:00,805
- You don't have a cat, do you?
- It's fine. It's fine, right?

85
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:03,574
It's fine. Merry Christmas, girls.
Come on in.

86
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,611
Don't you look cute
in your matching jackets.

87
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:09,814
They're just a little cranky
'cause the Steelers lost, so...

88
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,101
Jordan, Stevie, why don't
you tell your aunt Sarah

89
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:14,143
about your presidential
fitness award, huh?

90
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,989
It's a good story.

91
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:21,059
Hey, Howie.

92
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,495
So, what did you
ask Santa for this year?

93
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,597
Really nice.
They did look pretty good.

94
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,600
- It looks bigger in here.
- Um, toy car?

95
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,402
Look what Max has got
in his pocket.

96
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,504
A letter to Santa.

97
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,574
Video games?

98
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,910
Phone?

99
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,813
Dialysis?

100
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,617
- That's a long fucking drive.
- Thank you, guys.

101
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:50,154
Where do you want this stuff, tom?
Just anywhere? Yeah.

102
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,291
Christ on a stick. Would it
kill you to shovel your walk?

103
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,360
I could have broken
a hip out there.

104
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,796
Surprise! Please don't be mad.

105
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,666
Oh, aunt Dorothy.

106
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,268
It's so great to see you.

107
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,971
Yeah, well, your sister's
no mother Teresa,

108
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,174
but at least she swings by
every once in a while

109
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,710
to make sure that I'm not dead.

110
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,847
So, where's the nog?
I need to get merry.

111
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,983
Uh, it's in the kitchen.
Help yourself.

112
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,119
- Oh, tom, let me take that.
- I'm sorry.

113
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,788
- That's okay.
- Lord almighty.

114
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,224
Looks like Martha Stewart
threw up in here.

115
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,526
We left the door open.
Sorry about that. No, no.

116
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,728
We're such a mess, honestly.

117
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,563
Six hours, I mean, come on.

118
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,666
Uh, sorry.
Wasn't there another...

119
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,335
Hmm?

120
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,203
Child?

121
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,139
Chrissy! Darn it!

122
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,408
Jordan, I told you
to bring her inside.

123
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,743
- Not my kid.
- Come on, girls.

124
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,813
Tommy, help me get the baby and the
rest of the girl crap out of the truck.

125
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,549
- Do you mind? Thank you.
- Let's make some memories, huh?

126
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:55,386
Whoo! Thank you, honey.
Thank you.

127
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,089
Oh, my goodness.
A holiday roast is a surprise.

128
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,690
Hemorrhoids are a surprise.

129
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,660
She is a goddamn nightmare.
What were you thinking?

130
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,862
Come on, she's not that bad. Oh.

131
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,332
She's not! Besides,
she tricked me, okay?

132
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,235
I thought we were just dropping off gifts,
and she came to the door with a suitcase.

133
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,704
What was I supposed to do, tell her she
has to spend Christmas by herself?

134
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,907
No, but at least you
could have warned me

135
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,509
when one of your mistakes
is gonna become my problem.

136
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,112
You think everything I do
is a mistake.

137
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,781
Well...
Sorry. Look out. Look out.

138
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,383
Hey, honey. Oh. Oh!

139
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:26,951
I think this warhead's armed.

140
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,853
You're so stinky.

141
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,923
Okay, I'm gonna go change her.
Let's go this way.

142
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,758
Just set that up
wherever you want, t.

143
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,262
Uhh! The whole truck
smells like shit. Uhh!

144
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,131
So, what's for dinner?

145
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,447
That's my boy!

146
00:11:56,449 --> 00:12:00,051
That's my boy! It sure is.

147
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,286
I'm getting Howie junior
into game shape.

148
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:06,724
By the time he gets to high school, he's
gonna be the biggest lineman in the state.

149
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,394
Did you ever spend any time
on the field, Tommy?

150
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:14,132
No, actually, I didn't have time in my
younger years. I was in training mostly.

151
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:18,402
What were you training for?
Uh, army? Marines?

152
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,340
It was the eagle scouts.
Eagle scouts.

153
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:25,176
Now, eagle scouts, kids,

154
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:28,279
that's where you weave baskets and help
little old ladies across the street.

155
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,414
Am I right? No, no.

156
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:35,019
No, no, no. It was actually quite
a bit of, uh, survival training.

157
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,687
So...

158
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:40,124
Well, the only survival training
I need is my old smoke pole

159
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:43,528
and a big, fat box of buckshot
that I keep out in that truck.

160
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,497
A Shepherd has got to
protect his flock.

161
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,967
Honey, we said no gun talk
at the dinner table.

162
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,336
This family needs
a little gun talk,

163
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,872
whether it's at the dinner
table or anywhere else.

164
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,942
Wow. Looks like Chrissy's
really enjoying my Gravlax.

165
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,945
Careful, kids.

166
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,681
Remember that your aunt Sarah likes
everything to be clean and perfect,

167
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:07,018
and that's why she makes so much
food that you can't pronounce.

168
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,521
Well, I just thought you guys might like a
break from macaroni and cheese with hot dogs.

169
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:13,491
- Yeah, okay.
- Well, you were wrong.

170
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,960
And who doesn't make
a ham at Christmas?

171
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,762
What are you now, a Jew?

172
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,001
Maybe it's time
for dessert, hmm?

173
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:27,038
It's delicious, honey.
It's a little dry.

174
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,440
Okay. Well, mine's delicious.

175
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:33,844
Well, I guess I should
have gotten your bird.

176
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,153
Just say something nice.

177
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:38,149
I'll say it when she gets
back if dessert's good.

178
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,185
Well, if you could just do me a favor.
Tell him about Santa.

179
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,054
Just say something nice
about dessert. Hey.

180
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:46,023
Maxi-pad. Hear what
happened to Santa?

181
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,593
No, Stevie.
What happened to Santa?

182
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:52,230
Heard it on the news. His
sleigh crashed in the Rockies.

183
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:54,699
Shattered both his legs.

184
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:57,568
Frostbite took care of his pain
but not his hunger.

185
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,839
So, to survive, he had to
slaughter and eat his reindeer.

186
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,976
Including Rudolph.

187
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:09,580
"Ate" tiny reindeer. Get it?

188
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,183
Knock it off!

189
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,085
Don't start anything.

190
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:17,755
Hey, guys, take it easy.
They're just playing, Tommy.

191
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:27,865
Macaroni and cheese
and hot dogs. Oh, Jesus.

192
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,736
So what kind of godforsaken
concoction are you whipping up now?

193
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:34,972
You know how this fancy
food clogs my pipes.

194
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:38,309
Well, how about we go to your trailer
for Christmas next year, hmm?

195
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:42,246
And after you spent weeks decorating
and cooking and cleaning,

196
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,315
I might just waddle in
and start bitching and moaning

197
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,217
about everything
you've worked so hard on.

198
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,053
- Oh, Sarah, you know...
- No, aunt Dorothy, please.

199
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:53,357
For your sake, just... stay
the hell out of my kitchen.

200
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,797
You know, reindeer are actually
a sustainable food source

201
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,800
in the northern territories,
in Alaska, Canada.

202
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,802
This time of year,

203
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:09,507
we refer to reindeer as a
transportation system for Santa Claus.

204
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,844
We know you still believe
in the big, fat creeper.

205
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,846
I don't know what
you're talking about.

206
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,682
You sure about that?

207
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:21,218
Max, stop.

208
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,422
"Dear Santa,"

209
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:28,592
I know I haven't been great this
year, and I'm sorry for that,

210
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:32,596
but I was really hoping you could help
out me and my family this Christmas.

211
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,998
"We need you."

212
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,500
- Oh, maxi-pad, that's so sweet.
- Give it back!

213
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,269
Stop, Max.

214
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,805
Blah, blah, blah,
bullshit, bullshit.

215
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,941
- Ah, here we go... maxi's wish list.
- Stevie, stop. That's enough.

216
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,810
Wait, you're up first, Beth.

217
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:49,547
"I wish me and Beth could
hang out like we used to.

218
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:52,450
You might have noticed that
I don't have tons of friends."

219
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,219
Oh, no, really, Max?

220
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,823
"I wish my mom and dad
could fall in love again."

221
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:03,127
I know they get upset a lot,
with dad away from home so much.

222
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,629
"I think they really
just miss each other."

223
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:13,871
"Also, I wish things weren't so hard
for uncle Howard and aunt Linda."

224
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:19,143
So maybe you can lend them a
hand the rest of the year too.

225
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,914
And...

226
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,883
"And that..."

227
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:28,853
screw you. Dad does not
wish we were boys.

228
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:32,556
Okay, who wants Crème Brûlée?

229
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:38,062
Give me the letter!
Give it back!

230
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,331
Hey, Max. Hey. Hey! Hey!

231
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,932
Hey!

232
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,234
Girls!

233
00:16:46,037 --> 00:16:48,205
Hey! Hey!

234
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,107
Come on, Howard. Stevie, Jordan.

235
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,610
Come on. All right, all
right, that's enough.

236
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:56,013
- Are you okay? Honey?
- Enough. Enough.

237
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,883
I just wanted Christmas to be like
it used to be, but forget it.

238
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:01,452
I hate Christmas!
I hate all of you!

239
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:04,054
Max. Max!

240
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,457
Oh, lay off of him.

241
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,692
Kid deserves a prize
just for telling the truth.

242
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:22,306
- Can I come in?
- - No.

243
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:26,143
You know, they're leaving
right after Christmas,

244
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,580
so we only have to survive
another... three days.

245
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:31,215
I don't get it.

246
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,150
Every year it gets worse.

247
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,886
Why do we have to put up with their
crap just because we share DNA?

248
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:42,126
Because that's what
a family is, Max.

249
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,994
People you try
to be friends with

250
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,497
even though you don't have
a whole lot in common.

251
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,266
But why? Because.

252
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,734
Well...

253
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,972
Okay, you kind of got me there.

254
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:01,912
Or maybe it makes us work a little harder to
find what we do have in common, you know.

255
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,449
Put everything aside, think
of other people for a change.

256
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,185
Friends, family,

257
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,754
even the assholes
you normally can't stand.

258
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,691
Like uncle Howard?
Didn't wanna name names.

259
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:18,562
Dad, do you really
believe in all that?

260
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:21,599
I want to, Max.

261
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:26,770
But, hey,

262
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,773
bet there's still time to drop
that letter in the mailbox, huh?

263
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,126
Don't you find it
the least bit strange?

264
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:30,928
They can see
dust specks on Mars,

265
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,731
but no one noticed a giant
blizzard hurtling towards us.

266
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,633
Well, as soon
as the power's back,

267
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:38,636
you can write an angry e-mail
to the national weather service.

268
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:41,005
But in the meantime,
let's just try and stay calm.

269
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:43,841
Mom, there's something weird outside.
I am calm.

270
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:46,810
I would just be calmer if I knew how
we were gonna survive Christmas

271
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:50,681
with 12 people stuck in a house with no
hot water, no heat and no electricity.

272
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:55,085
Or food. Well, there's
plenty of leftovers, Howard.

273
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,122
- Beer it is.
- Phone's dead too.

274
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:00,157
- Mom!
- What, Max?

275
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,558
There's a snowman in our yard.

276
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:04,762
See?

277
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:10,000
That's... That's great, Max.

278
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,002
But who built it?

279
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:16,140
You can barely see across the street,
but it doesn't look like it's just us.

280
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:19,777
I can walk over, check with the turners.
The turners are in Hawaii.

281
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,479
The Lamberts are in Florida, and the
Cartwrights stopped talking to us

282
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:26,150
after Max's noodle incident.
After his what?

283
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:29,987
Max, please go and get Omi out of the fireplace
before she burns the whole house down.

284
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,957
I'll get it!

285
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,893
Fine.

286
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,428
Seriously, what are we gonna do?

287
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:39,897
Ooh! Merry Christmas.

288
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:43,467
Sign here. Yeah. Wow.

289
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,570
Honey, stuff to carry!

290
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,305
Some weather, huh? Yeah.

291
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,175
It's a ghost town out there.
Roads are a nightmare.

292
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:53,811
Yeah, no kidding.
Hey, these too?

293
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,512
Uh, not mine.

294
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,915
Uh, must be from the boys in brown.
All right.

295
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,651
Merry Christmas. Yeah, you too.

296
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,087
Ah, what is it?
Hey, look at this, huh?

297
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:06,056
What? They got more stuff.

298
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,092
How come rich people
get all the free shit?

299
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:11,028
I don't know, honey.
Democrats, probably.

300
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,332
Oh, my god!

301
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,235
Who needs this much cheese?

302
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:20,571
One singular moment.

303
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:23,774
You guys, I've texted Derek, like, nine
times and he still hasn't written back.

304
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,542
That is not normal.

305
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,911
It's the blizzard, honey.
Nothing's working right now.

306
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:31,048
Can I walk over and check on him?
It's only a few blocks.

307
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,717
I don't think
that's a good idea.

308
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,964
I could see if anyone
else has power on the way.

309
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,288
She'll be fine.

310
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,591
Okay. One hour.

311
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:43,627
When you get back, I want you to spend
some girl time with Jordan and Stevie.

312
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:45,195
Got it?

313
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,131
You call that a reversal?

314
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,233
Come on, Jordy, plant your feet!

315
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:51,435
Plant your feet. All right.
Right.

316
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:54,404
You know what I mean. Thanks.

317
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,207
Be careful, okay?
Okay. Back later.

318
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,710
Love you. One hour.

319
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,378
Okay.

320
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,283
Max, I told you
to get Omi out of the...

321
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,330
She says hot chocolate
makes everything better.

322
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,680
Oh, my god.

323
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,322
Please!

324
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,863
Somebody help me!

325
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,765
Please!

326
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,333
Daddy!

327
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,306
Help!

328
00:27:28,212 --> 00:27:29,646
Get anything?

329
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:32,082
No.

330
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:38,488
It's the weirdest thing. There's no
cars, no people, not even a salt truck.

331
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:43,493
Don't suppose you got me a backup
generator for Christmas, did you?

332
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,931
Yeah, it's under the tree next
to your ties and underwear.

333
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:49,399
Good.

334
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,274
It's getting late.

335
00:27:57,276 --> 00:28:00,177
Beth should be home by now. She's fine.
She's at Derek's.

336
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,179
All the more reason to worry.

337
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:05,949
Hey, hon, relax.
Just for once, okay?

338
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:12,255
How's everybody else doing?

339
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:17,894
You know, cranky, bored,
sick of the snow.

340
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:20,097
And each other. 'Tis the season.

341
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:27,104
Oh, god, I miss us.

342
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,141
Me too.

343
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,852
Mom, dad.

344
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,622
It's already dark out
and Beth isn't back yet.

345
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,064
Hey, Howard.

346
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:57,067
Do you think your Hummer could
get through this mess? Lucinda?

347
00:28:57,069 --> 00:29:00,070
I could point her due east,
hit the gas

348
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,806
and she'd be storming the
beaches at Normandy by sunrise.

349
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:05,408
What's on your mind, t?
Well, it's-it's Beth.

350
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,245
She went to her boyfriend's earlier
and she hasn't come back yet.

351
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:13,116
See? Let them out of your sight for one
second, and boom, shotgun wedding.

352
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,352
Aunt Dorothy, please.

353
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:17,187
Well, you ought to know.

354
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:21,024
It's probably nothing. But I
thought we'd go pick her up,

355
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:23,994
take a quick swing around town,
see what's going on out there.

356
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:26,930
A little recon mission, huh?
Thought you'd never ask.

357
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,798
- Okay.
- Go to mama.

358
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,867
Yep. All righty.

359
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,370
Thomas. Thomas.

360
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,474
What? Why?

361
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:39,342
What the hell is she
so riled up about?

362
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,549
She says not to go.

363
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:48,051
That it's too dangerous, and that we
should wait until the storm's over.

364
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:49,686
- Tom.
- No, I got this.

365
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:52,122
Hey, mom, we have
to go pick up Beth,

366
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,824
but Max and Sarah will take care
of you while I'm gone, okay?

367
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:57,160
Mom. Hey, mom, listen.

368
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,699
Everything's gonna be okay.

369
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,724
Global warming, my ass.

370
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:30,694
Must be negative 20 out here.

371
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:32,996
This just doesn't
make any sense.

372
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,332
You try am?
Yeah, I tried everything.

373
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,301
The storm probably knocked
out the radio stations too.

374
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,171
I guess so.

375
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:45,008
What I wouldn't give for a little
bing Crosby right about now.

376
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:53,583
All right, slow down.

377
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,285
What is that?

378
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:06,963
Is that a snowplow?

379
00:31:10,434 --> 00:31:12,869
Ahh.

380
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,508
Hello?

381
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,434
Christ.

382
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:47,437
Poor bastard must have
sailed clear through.

383
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:50,473
Looks more like the opposite.

384
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,075
What do you mean?

385
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,844
The glass is punched in.

386
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,327
We got to find Beth.

387
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:17,000
You packed guns on Christmas.

388
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:19,369
Always be prepared, boy scout.

389
00:32:20,671 --> 00:32:22,339
It's kind of heavy.

390
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:26,076
Yeah. It's Linda's.

391
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,422
Oh, my gosh.

392
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,059
You had mom's angel
this whole time?

393
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,961
Yeah. I thought you knew.

394
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,463
No.

395
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,200
Oh.

396
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:52,869
Remember we used to fight
over who got to place her?

397
00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:57,140
Yeah. You fought dirty.
I still have the scars.

398
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,642
Where do you think
my girls get it from?

399
00:33:04,348 --> 00:33:07,117
Wow. You saved everything.

400
00:33:08,185 --> 00:33:10,186
Yeah.

401
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,489
I figured that's what mom
would have done, you know.

402
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,336
Mom?

403
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,940
Probably just squirrels.

404
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,343
In this weather?

405
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,073
See?

406
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,708
- Squirrels.
- Right.

407
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,611
Probably playing
with their nuts.

408
00:34:26,163 --> 00:34:27,630
Beth?

409
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,473
Derek!

410
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:40,343
Beth!

411
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:43,179
Quiet, Tommy. I don't like this.

412
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:09,372
Whoever did this is
a demented son of a bitch.

413
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:21,251
Don't worry. We'll
find her, buddy.

414
00:35:32,062 --> 00:35:34,063
Looks like a gas line blew.

415
00:35:44,074 --> 00:35:45,909
What's that?

416
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:52,649
I've hunted a lot of game
in my day.

417
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:56,152
Those are hooves. Big ones too.

418
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,155
Could be an elk or a goat.

419
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,258
What kind of goat
walks on its hind legs?

420
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:09,165
Beth!

421
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,069
Beth!

422
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,072
Beth!

423
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,411
Beth!

424
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:24,948
Beth!

425
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:29,052
- Beth!
- Tommy!

426
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:31,588
Wait up!

427
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:42,699
Howard!

428
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,041
- Oh, my god!
- Hold on, Howard!

429
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,210
Help! Oh, god! Help me!

430
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:57,814
Come on! Tommy!

431
00:36:57,816 --> 00:36:59,048
Aah!

432
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,985
Something...
Something's biting me!

433
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:04,087
Don't let go!

434
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:12,195
Tommy?

435
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,906
Let's go!

436
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,575
What was that thing?

437
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,243
I don't know,
but we have to move!

438
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,820
Oh, my god. Oh.

439
00:37:40,624 --> 00:37:43,326
Lucinda!

440
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,797
Where do you think you're going?

441
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:49,799
To find them. I don't like this.

442
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,835
What are you talking about? Tom and Howard
know what they're doing. They're fine.

443
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,204
- Are they?
- Mom?

444
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,474
Honey, I'll be right back. I promise.
Just lock the door...

445
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:02,345
Oh, god! Max, get the first aid kit!
Sarah, lock the door!

446
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:04,614
Girls! Make some room
for your dad!

447
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,182
- Get the door!
- Shut the door!

448
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:08,484
Where's Beth? We heard gunshots!

449
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:12,388
I'll explain everything, but right now everybody
just needs to stay calm and stay inside!

450
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,724
And get away from the windows!

451
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:16,959
Swords, guns, knives, pots, pans!
Get whatever you can...

452
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,361
Howard! What?

453
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:20,363
Not here.

454
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,066
Jiminy Christmas.

455
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:26,202
What happened out there?
Nothing.

456
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:28,738
It's just a scratch.

457
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,507
- Oh, my god. It looks like something bit you.
- Nope.

458
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,710
Probably a bear trap
under the snow or something.

459
00:38:33,712 --> 00:38:35,044
We don't have bears here.

460
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,516
Okay. Um...

461
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:43,486
Kids, why don't you go into the kitchen
and get something to eat now, okay?

462
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,421
You just don't wanna tell us
what's going on here!

463
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,523
Everybody into the kitchen
right now, Max, okay? Right now.

464
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,892
Come on. Let's go.
Girls, come on.

465
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:52,921
Aunt Dorothy, will you
keep an eye on them?

466
00:38:52,947 --> 00:38:53,930
Why me?

467
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:56,299
I never liked kids,
even when I<i> was</i> one.

468
00:38:58,569 --> 00:38:59,769
Please.

469
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:02,071
Oh, all right.

470
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,440
All right!

471
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:07,677
Come on, guys. I'm gonna teach you
how to make peppermint schnapps.

472
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:12,782
Mom.

473
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:15,184
Mom, will you please go
into the kitchen

474
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,420
and help with the kids?

475
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:28,197
Come here, baby.

476
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:34,270
See? A little sugar
and a little spice...

477
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:36,606
Uh-huh...

478
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:39,542
Makes everything nice.

479
00:39:41,478 --> 00:39:43,346
Mmm.

480
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:52,054
All right.
But don't you rat me out.

481
00:39:54,424 --> 00:39:57,760
Who or what did all this?

482
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:01,764
Your guess is as good as mine.

483
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:04,433
First I thought
it was a gang thing.

484
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:07,503
But between this and all the
crazy stuff we saw out here,

485
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,105
it just doesn't add up.

486
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:11,407
It could be terrorists, right?

487
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,977
Yeah, terrorists. Maybe traded their
suicide vests for rabid snow dogs?

488
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,679
Tommy!

489
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:18,281
Tom, god! Sorry. Sorry.

490
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:20,483
And, um...

491
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,686
- Beth?
- Okay.

492
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,922
She wasn't at Derek's,
but that doesn't mean anything.

493
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,590
She may have found
somewhere safe.

494
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,259
- So she's still out there.
- Yes. And we will find her.

495
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,329
I had to make sure you guys were safe.
I had to get Howard back...

496
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:35,364
I don't care how long it takes.
We have to keep looking.

497
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:37,133
We have to pair up
and take turns...

498
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:39,635
- yes.
- We can't go back out there! You see this?

499
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,831
It's damn near frostbite
in under four minutes!

500
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:43,339
Honey, keep your voice down.

501
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:45,208
Besides it being
subzero out there,

502
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:49,011
someone's tearing through your fancy-ass
neighborhood picking everybody off.

503
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:49,922
It's the truth!

504
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,648
Honey, sweetheart. Listen, why
don't we just leave? Right?

505
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,318
We can all pile in the truck and
we'll just see as far as we can get,

506
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,019
and we can pick up Beth...
The truck's gone.

507
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,722
- Torn to pieces.
- Linda, Sarah: What?

508
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:02,525
Yeah. And even if she wasn't,
the streets are totally screwed.

509
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:05,461
We can't go anywhere.
It's too dangerous. You got it?

510
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,897
Howard, how much ammo
do you have?

511
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:12,134
A couple shells still loaded,
maybe a dozen in my pocket. Why?

512
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,137
I think our best bet
is to stay put.

513
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,406
Board up all the doors
and windows.

514
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:20,343
And as soon as the weather
breaks, we'll go find her.

515
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:22,511
I told you we should
have gone to my brother's.

516
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,013
Sure, Howard.
Christmas on a pig farm.

517
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:26,349
- Jesus was born in a barn!
- Knock it off, you guys!

518
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:28,084
What are we gonna tell the kids?

519
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:31,220
- I don't know. The truth?
- Sure. Which version of it?

520
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:34,090
Hey, you guys. Oh, god.

521
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:35,691
How much did you hear?

522
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,727
Enough.

523
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:40,997
Mama, did someone take Beth?
Are they coming for us?

524
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:44,066
No. No, babies, no.
Everything's fine.

525
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,369
Beth's just with her boyfriend,
that's all.

526
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:49,272
And nothing bad's gonna happen
on Christmas, right?

527
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:52,241
You know what? Let's have a campout, okay?
We'll watch a movie. Yeah?

528
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:55,344
Let's get cozy on the couch. Go get
your sister, Stevie. Come on, baby.

529
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,847
Come on. We'll find
her, I promise.

530
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,789
<i>"And lo, the angel
of the lord came upon them."</i>

531
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:09,759
<i>And the glory of the lord
shone round about them.</i>

532
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:11,627
<i>And they were so afraid.</i>

533
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,763
<i>And the angel said unto them...</i>

534
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:16,432
<i>"'fear not. For behold, I bring
you tidings of great joy.'"</i>

535
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:18,968
won't the battery die?

536
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:22,104
Got to die sometime. Might as
well enjoy it while we can.

537
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,778
Hey.

538
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,479
Beth's a tough girl.

539
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,483
Takes after her mom.

540
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,585
I'm sure she's fine.

541
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:38,521
Thank you.

542
00:42:46,763 --> 00:42:49,565
Hey, Tommy. I, um...

543
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:56,172
I just wanna say thanks
for, uh, you know,

544
00:42:56,174 --> 00:42:58,441
saving my ass back there.

545
00:42:58,443 --> 00:43:02,144
Oh. Well, sure.

546
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:03,579
No problem.

547
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:12,221
And I just wanna say
I'm sorry for...

548
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,692
Thinking you're such a spineless
dick all these years.

549
00:43:19,429 --> 00:43:21,063
Yeah.

550
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:28,371
- You should get some sleep, pal.
- How?

551
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:30,473
Mm, good point.

552
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,013
Hey, dad.

553
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:38,848
Are we gonna die?

554
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:41,550
Hey. No, no.

555
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:44,553
No.

556
00:43:46,823 --> 00:43:48,357
Omi's been acting different.

557
00:43:49,626 --> 00:43:51,794
Ever since the storm.

558
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,130
Yeah, well, you know...

559
00:43:57,467 --> 00:43:59,402
She always gets a little
weird around Christmas.

560
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:02,671
How come?

561
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:04,774
I don't know. She never
wanted to talk about it.

562
00:44:05,742 --> 00:44:07,309
Max, come on.

563
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,878
Time for bed.

564
00:44:10,313 --> 00:44:11,981
It's going to be fine.

565
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,089
All right.

566
00:44:34,704 --> 00:44:37,840
You know, Linda and I,
we butt heads, but...

567
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,410
I can't imagine life
without her.

568
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:47,583
Yeah, I know what you mean.

569
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:49,785
One of us should probably
stay up and keep watch.

570
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:53,589
That's a good idea.
I'll go first.

571
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:56,258
No. You go ahead and catch
some winks with your family.

572
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,927
Are you sure? Yeah.

573
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,530
A Shepherd has got
to protect his flock.

574
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:05,468
Night, Howard. Good night.

575
00:47:05,555 --> 00:47:07,656
Whoo-hoo!

576
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:58,307
Ahh!

577
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:18,327
- Howie!
- Dad! Dad!

578
00:48:20,463 --> 00:48:22,197
Hang on, Howie!

579
00:48:23,266 --> 00:48:25,434
Dad! Dad!

580
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:28,504
Sarah! Hold on, Sarah!

581
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:31,607
- Mom!
- Call 911!

582
00:48:43,853 --> 00:48:45,921
Hold on!

583
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,565
Max, get the fire extinguisher!
Pull!

584
00:48:58,501 --> 00:49:02,304
Help me! Help me! Help me!

585
00:49:06,509 --> 00:49:07,576
I got you!

586
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:21,023
Howie!

587
00:49:21,025 --> 00:49:23,459
- Howie!
- No, no, no!

588
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,362
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

589
00:49:33,803 --> 00:49:35,437
Oh, geez.

590
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:44,079
Honey, are you okay?
Are you hurt? Hon?

591
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:48,851
What... unholy thing was that?

592
00:49:50,888 --> 00:49:53,155
Howard. Howard.

593
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,192
It's my fault. No.

594
00:49:57,194 --> 00:50:00,429
I fell asleep,
and they got our boy.

595
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:02,698
It's all my fault.

596
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,735
<i>Nein.</i>

597
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:17,279
Tom, what's she saying?
"This is all of our fault.

598
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:19,615
He's come for us all?"

599
00:50:20,683 --> 00:50:22,751
He? Who...

600
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:24,386
Who's he? I-i don't know.

601
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,188
Mom, what are you talking about?

602
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,056
Please, listen.

603
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:30,492
English. I knew it.

604
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:33,295
I must tell you something.

605
00:50:33,297 --> 00:50:35,264
To all of you.

606
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:41,403
It started with the wind.

607
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:49,044
<i>On a cold winter night,
much like this.</i>

608
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,815
<i>It was almost Christmas.</i>

609
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:57,719
<i>But this Christmas was darker,</i>

610
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,321
<i>less cheerful.</i>

611
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:04,960
<i>But I still believed in Santa,</i>

612
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:08,464
<i>in magic,</i>

613
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:11,400
<i>and miracles</i>

614
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:15,838
<i>and the hope
that we could find joy again.</i>

615
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:20,275
<i>But our village had given up</i>

616
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:22,911
<i>on miracles and on each other.</i>

617
00:51:26,749 --> 00:51:30,085
<i>They had forgotten
the spirit of Christmas,</i>

618
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,421
<i>the sacrifice of giving.</i>

619
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:38,560
<i>And my family was no different.</i>

620
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:46,034
<i>I tried to help them
to believe again,</i>

621
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:50,405
<i>but we were no longer
the loving family I remembered.</i>

622
00:51:53,943 --> 00:51:56,578
<i>They too had given up.</i>

623
00:51:58,214 --> 00:52:01,550
<i>And eventually, so did I.</i>

624
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,122
<i>And for the first time,</i>

625
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,525
<i>I didn't wish for a miracle.</i>

626
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,529
<i>I wished for them to go away.</i>

627
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:18,433
<i>A wish I would come to regret.</i>

628
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,238
<i>And that night,</i>

629
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,909
<i>in the darkness
of a howling blizzard,</i>

630
00:52:26,911 --> 00:52:29,444
<i>I got my wish.</i>

631
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:38,687
<i>I knew Saint Nicholas
was not coming this year.</i>

632
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:44,660
<i>Instead it was a much darker,</i>

633
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:47,563
<i>more ancient spirit.</i>

634
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:54,236
<i>The shadow of Saint Nicholas.</i>

635
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:56,638
<i>It was Krampus.</i>

636
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:03,245
<i>And as he had
for thousands of years,</i>

637
00:53:03,247 --> 00:53:08,216
<i>Krampus came not to reward,
but to punish.</i>

638
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:11,820
<i>Not to give, but to take.</i>

639
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:15,757
<i>He and his helpers.</i>

640
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:20,929
<i>I could only listen</i>

641
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:24,700
<i>as they dragged my family
into the underworld,</i>

642
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:28,637
<i>knowing that I would be next.</i>

643
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:34,476
<i>But Krampus
didn't take me that night.</i>

644
00:53:36,145 --> 00:53:38,947
<i>He left me as a reminder</i>

645
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:43,251
<i>of what happens
when hope is lost,</i>

646
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:46,622
<i>when belief is forgotten</i>

647
00:53:46,624 --> 00:53:50,392
<i>and the Christmas spirit dies.</i>

648
00:54:05,908 --> 00:54:08,143
And here I thought
I was the one losing it.

649
00:54:08,145 --> 00:54:10,445
Howard. What?

650
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:13,281
You believe this senile horseshit?
I don't know.

651
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:16,318
- Evil Santa?
- Jesus h. Almighty.

652
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,955
She'll be yammering about a
rabid Easter bunny come spring.

653
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:22,891
Howard, that's enough.

654
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:27,295
You damn right it's enough.

655
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:30,365
Whoever the hell's messing with
us took my boy and your daughter,

656
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:34,403
and we're sitting around listening
to some twisted bedtime story?

657
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:38,140
Screw that.

658
00:54:38,142 --> 00:54:40,509
I'm getting Howie back. Howard!

659
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:41,977
- Daddy, don't go!
- Tommy, don't!

660
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:43,679
Don't, Tommy!

661
00:54:43,681 --> 00:54:45,113
Whoa! Whoa!

662
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,784
I'm starting to like you.

663
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,552
I am.

664
00:54:50,554 --> 00:54:53,155
But this is my choice.

665
00:54:53,157 --> 00:54:56,658
Howard, what are you doing? We've got
four other kids here to protect.

666
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,127
Howard.

667
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:02,664
Baby, please don't do this. Listen, we
can figure something else out. Honey.

668
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:05,534
This<i> is</i> how I figure things out.

669
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:07,903
Howard, you don't wanna do this.
Howard.

670
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:09,071
Howard.

671
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:16,945
Howie!

672
00:55:22,051 --> 00:55:23,819
Howie.

673
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:31,460
No, shut the door!
Inside! Shut it!

674
00:55:40,436 --> 00:55:42,437
Don't open the door.

675
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,741
Dad?

676
00:55:45,743 --> 00:55:47,509
What are we gonna do now?

677
00:55:49,178 --> 00:55:50,746
We keep the fire hot.

678
00:56:21,477 --> 00:56:25,781
But what if you've
been good, like, all year?

679
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:28,583
And you leave out milk and cookies
and do everything else right?

680
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:44,599
"It's not what you do.
It's what you believe.

681
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:48,336
And what you've given up,
in here."

682
00:56:50,072 --> 00:56:52,307
But can't we make him go away?

683
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,348
What's she saying?

684
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:02,751
- I'm not sure.
- She says we're fucked.

685
00:57:04,353 --> 00:57:05,520
Eh.

686
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:07,589
How did you...

687
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:10,826
'cause I'm old enough to know when life
is coming at you with his pants down.

688
00:57:30,379 --> 00:57:31,947
Hey.

689
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:37,419
When they took Howie,
what did you see up there?

690
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:42,724
You believe that story, right?

691
00:57:44,493 --> 00:57:45,727
Do you?

692
00:57:45,729 --> 00:57:48,663
I don't know
what I believe anymore.

693
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:50,866
I know I'm going out
there to find Beth.

694
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:53,535
I have to. I don't even
care if I die trying.

695
00:57:53,537 --> 00:57:56,872
I know. Listen. Let's get Howard and Linda.
I have an idea.

696
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:52,060
Linda.

697
00:58:52,062 --> 00:58:54,262
Can we talk with you
and Howard for a minute?

698
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:55,830
Can it wait?

699
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:59,267
I just wanna get these
re wrapped for the kids.

700
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:02,370
It's important.

701
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,072
The snowplow?

702
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:06,541
The keys were in the ignition,
and it was beat to hell.

703
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,244
But if it runs,
I drive it back here,

704
00:59:09,246 --> 00:59:11,613
then everyone piles
in the car and follows

705
00:59:11,615 --> 00:59:14,115
while I clear a path
in front of us.

706
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:16,618
And go where?

707
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,887
The mall doubles
as an emergency shelter.

708
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:21,623
And if it's empty,
we'll try the police station.

709
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:23,992
And what if they're gone too?

710
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:28,063
Then we keep driving
till we see lights or people,

711
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,398
plowed road,
somewhere safe for the kids.

712
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,167
And then
we bring help back here.

713
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:34,336
For Beth and Howie.

714
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:36,838
You're not thinking of going for
the plow by yourself, are you?

715
00:59:39,308 --> 00:59:42,210
Well, a Shepherd's got
to protect his flock.

716
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:32,660
I can't believe you're afraid
to come up here by yourself.

717
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:35,563
It's not my fault aunt Dorothy
clogged up the crapper.

718
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,868
Hey, Stevie? Yeah.

719
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:44,172
Do you think they took Howie 'cause
of the time he painted the cats?

720
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:46,041
I don't know, Jordan.

721
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:51,946
- Do you think he's dead?
- I don't know.

722
01:00:53,849 --> 01:00:55,750
Jordan?

723
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,454
Stevie?

724
01:01:02,324 --> 01:01:05,393
Beth? Beth, you up there?

725
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:08,430
Stevie? Jordan?

726
01:01:08,432 --> 01:01:10,432
What are you doing?

727
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:13,568
Where have you been?
Everyone's freaking out.

728
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:15,537
Come up here and I'll show you.

729
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:18,106
I've been waiting for you guys.

730
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:19,607
Hurry.

731
01:01:20,876 --> 01:01:24,612
- Have you told Max yet?
- No. Not yet.

732
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:27,749
Jordan?

733
01:01:27,751 --> 01:01:29,451
Stevie!

734
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:34,122
Where are they?
Where did they go?

735
01:01:34,124 --> 01:01:36,791
They were just here. I think
they went to the bathroom.

736
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:39,594
- And you just let them go?
- Was there another option?

737
01:01:42,731 --> 01:01:44,599
Jordan! Stevie!

738
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:46,801
Linda. Jordan.

739
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:49,471
Listen.

740
01:01:49,473 --> 01:01:50,939
Honey, who is that?

741
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:53,174
Howard, stay here.

742
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,048
Omi. Hmm?

743
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,983
I think all this
might be my fault.

744
01:02:16,398 --> 01:02:19,067
- Uncle Howard?
- Shh.

745
01:02:22,471 --> 01:02:26,007
Rosie. Come here, girl.

746
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,879
Useless turd.

747
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:33,581
All right, wait here.

748
01:02:50,132 --> 01:02:52,667
Jordan?

749
01:02:52,669 --> 01:02:54,536
Stevie?

750
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,958
- Jordan.
- Stevie?

751
01:03:30,005 --> 01:03:31,706
You guys.

752
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:41,983
What the hell is this?

753
01:03:47,489 --> 01:03:50,692
Goddamn it.

754
01:03:50,694 --> 01:03:52,493
Shh, shh.

755
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:55,396
It's okay. I got you.

756
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:58,433
You're gonna be okay. Shh.

757
01:04:25,694 --> 01:04:27,428
Hey!

758
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:12,006
Oh, come on.

759
01:05:13,942 --> 01:05:15,743
Hey!

760
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,478
Oh, my god!

761
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:21,582
Oh, my god!

762
01:05:26,121 --> 01:05:29,490
Shoot it, tom! Shoot it!

763
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:30,892
For god's sake, shoot it!

764
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:36,664
Linda!

765
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:48,843
We should have gone
to my brother's.

766
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:50,144
Ya!

767
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,060
Where did it go? I don't know!

768
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:07,695
Oh, my god.

769
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,493
Ow!

770
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:44,065
- Bear!
- What?

771
01:06:44,067 --> 01:06:46,100
Bear!

772
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:36,851
Got to be kidding me!

773
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:47,795
- Merry Christmas, mother...
- There he is! Charge!

774
01:08:08,685 --> 01:08:10,418
That's a good girl.

775
01:08:38,046 --> 01:08:40,781
Wha... Stevie? Stevie?

776
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:13,481
Hey! Give me back my kids,
you... fudger!

777
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:17,618
Jordan!

778
01:09:19,087 --> 01:09:21,889
Stevie. I'm coming, baby.

779
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:25,159
Stevie. Baby.

780
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:28,930
It's okay. Mama's here.
Mama's here. There you go.

781
01:09:28,932 --> 01:09:30,765
Mom, it got Jordan.

782
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:33,334
It was gonna eat me next.

783
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:37,605
Thanks, honey. Are you okay?

784
01:09:37,607 --> 01:09:38,973
Yeah. Are you okay?

785
01:09:53,722 --> 01:09:55,189
What?

786
01:09:56,224 --> 01:09:58,025
Mom!

787
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,860
Max!

788
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:03,698
- Come on, baby.
- Come on, baby. It's okay.

789
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,566
Max, are you okay? Yeah.

790
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:07,969
- What happened up there?
- They got Jordan.

791
01:10:07,971 --> 01:10:10,438
Who?

792
01:10:14,142 --> 01:10:16,911
Mom?

793
01:10:16,913 --> 01:10:19,981
I think it's panicking,
trying to get outside.

794
01:10:19,983 --> 01:10:22,917
Well, we boarded everything up.

795
01:10:22,919 --> 01:10:24,885
Howard, that's Jordan.

796
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:28,122
We got to get in there. We got
to get in there and get her out.

797
01:10:28,124 --> 01:10:30,758
Linda, what are we dealing with?
What did you see up there?

798
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,927
You don't wanna know,
sweetheart.

799
01:10:32,929 --> 01:10:37,064
Honey, I just got my ass kicked
by a bunch of Christmas cookies,

800
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,967
so trust me when I say
I can take it! Shh.

801
01:10:50,345 --> 01:10:52,179
No, no, no.
Max, what are you doing?

802
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:57,051
Go get 'em, girl.

803
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:05,660
Get 'em, Rosie.

804
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:26,447
Rosie?

805
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:43,297
Ew!

806
01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:48,436
For god's sake, Howard,
shoot it!

807
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:54,875
- Get it off me!
- Dad! Dad! No!

808
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:56,777
Howard! You bitch!

809
01:12:01,416 --> 01:12:03,384
Get it off me! God!

810
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:08,923
Dad!

811
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:10,424
Omi!

812
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:31,078
Aunt Dorothy? Finish it.

813
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,314
With pleasure.

814
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:42,256
Aw, shit.

815
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:26,100
Howard, where's Chrissy?
I don't know!

816
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:27,835
Where's the baby?

817
01:13:27,837 --> 01:13:29,470
Honey, where's your sister?

818
01:13:31,239 --> 01:13:32,973
No!

819
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:35,442
No! Howard!

820
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:37,645
Howard, the baby!

821
01:13:37,647 --> 01:13:39,713
I'll see you in hell.

822
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:46,353
- Twisted fairy-tale horseshit!
- Howard, no!

823
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:52,092
Oh, great.

824
01:14:21,022 --> 01:14:24,191
Are you okay? Are you okay?

825
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:26,060
Max, get the ammo.

826
01:14:30,131 --> 01:14:30,920
Where did they go?

827
01:14:30,946 --> 01:14:33,067
I'm more worried about
when they come back.

828
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:35,636
We need to make a break for it.
For what, tom?

829
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:37,638
The snowplow.
It's our only shot.

830
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,973
And then we're going after 'em.

831
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:42,309
What is going on?

832
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,978
Sarah, what's going on?

833
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,546
Mom, come on. We're leaving.

834
01:14:45,548 --> 01:14:47,381
You're gonna be okay.

835
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:52,419
Mom! We have to go. Now!

836
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:57,191
It's him.

837
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:16,310
Come on. Okay.

838
01:15:18,179 --> 01:15:20,848
Hurry, hurry. Get your gloves on.
Put your hood up.

839
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:25,653
Ready?

840
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:34,128
Everybody,
hold on to each other.

841
01:15:43,571 --> 01:15:45,539
Omi!

842
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,241
Be good.

843
01:15:47,243 --> 01:15:48,542
Omi!

844
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:51,211
Omi!

845
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:53,113
Omi, no!

846
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:55,282
Omi!

847
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:58,085
Mom! Mom, open the door!

848
01:15:58,087 --> 01:15:59,553
Mom!

849
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:03,524
Mom, you open this door now!

850
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,894
The window.

851
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:10,164
Dad! She wants to face him.

852
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:11,765
She's trying to help.

853
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:20,374
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Go!

854
01:18:38,746 --> 01:18:40,380
Keep moving!

855
01:18:59,335 --> 01:19:02,636
Go! Go! Get behind me. Go.

856
01:19:02,638 --> 01:19:04,972
Go, go, go! Keep moving.

857
01:19:04,974 --> 01:19:06,707
Come on, buddy.

858
01:19:11,779 --> 01:19:13,547
Come on.

859
01:19:25,193 --> 01:19:27,694
You have to go. You have to go.

860
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:29,296
I need you to go. No.

861
01:19:29,298 --> 01:19:32,366
All of you, you have to go.
Do you understand?

862
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:35,068
Keep driving. Do you understand?

863
01:19:38,006 --> 01:19:41,241
I love you. I love you, buddy.

864
01:19:42,777 --> 01:19:45,379
Go! Now! Go!

865
01:19:47,715 --> 01:19:49,249
Go!

866
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:57,224
Come on!

867
01:20:20,648 --> 01:20:22,082
Come on.

868
01:20:26,187 --> 01:20:28,922
Keep going. Keep going.
God. Get in.

869
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:30,757
I want you to get up in here.

870
01:20:30,759 --> 01:20:33,060
I don't want you to move. You stay here.
You don't move.

871
01:20:35,898 --> 01:20:39,566
- Okay? You understand?
- Mom! Mom, please!

872
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:41,235
Sarah!

873
01:20:41,237 --> 01:20:43,637
Baby, go with your aunt Sarah.

874
01:20:44,872 --> 01:20:46,840
Stevie, sweetheart, it's okay.

875
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:49,176
Mom! It's okay. Come on.

876
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:50,344
Sarah!

877
01:20:51,879 --> 01:20:53,880
Stay here. I'll be right back.

878
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:56,450
Sarah!

879
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:59,019
Mom! No!

880
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:01,555
- I love you.
- Mom! Mom!

881
01:21:01,557 --> 01:21:03,156
Mom!

882
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:10,464
Max, we got to go.

883
01:21:10,466 --> 01:21:12,933
Max, we got to go. Max.

884
01:21:14,602 --> 01:21:16,870
Come on.

885
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,806
It's not starting.

886
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:22,376
It's not starting.
Why isn't it starting? Come on.

887
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:24,611
Come on, Max, please.
I'm trying.

888
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:27,914
I don't even know how to drive a stick.
We have a hybrid!

889
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:30,217
Come on! Please!

890
01:21:43,131 --> 01:21:45,499
Stevie! Stevie!

891
01:22:07,989 --> 01:22:12,259
Max! Max! No! No!

892
01:22:13,328 --> 01:22:15,028
Stevie!

893
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:05,212
<i>He left me as a reminder
of what happens</i>

894
01:23:05,214 --> 01:23:08,849
<i>when hope is lost,</i>

895
01:23:08,851 --> 01:23:12,519
<i>when belief is forgotten</i>

896
01:23:12,521 --> 01:23:16,390
<i>and the Christmas spirit dies.</i>

897
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:35,909
Help! Help! Help!

898
01:23:35,911 --> 01:23:37,544
Help me!

899
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:43,817
Max!

900
01:23:55,396 --> 01:23:56,963
Help me!

901
01:24:01,736 --> 01:24:04,104
Hey!

902
01:24:04,106 --> 01:24:05,372
Asshole!

903
01:24:17,585 --> 01:24:20,253
I take back my wish!

904
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:22,222
I take it all back!

905
01:24:26,661 --> 01:24:29,129
Give me back my family!

906
01:25:25,553 --> 01:25:27,721
Max!

907
01:25:30,526 --> 01:25:32,626
Let her go!

908
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:35,295
Help me!

909
01:25:54,683 --> 01:25:56,149
Please.

910
01:25:56,984 --> 01:25:59,185
I know you can fix this.

911
01:25:59,187 --> 01:26:00,654
Give them back.

912
01:26:03,157 --> 01:26:04,591
Take me instead.

913
01:26:42,063 --> 01:26:43,830
What are you doing?
I said, take me.

914
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:48,768
Take me. What are you doing?
Take me!

915
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:50,403
No!

916
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:52,372
Stevie!

917
01:26:58,245 --> 01:27:00,347
No! Let me go!

918
01:27:02,116 --> 01:27:03,383
No! No! Please!

919
01:27:12,126 --> 01:27:13,627
I'm sorry.

920
01:27:15,262 --> 01:27:17,664
I just wanted Christmas
to be like it used to be.

921
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:24,237
No!

922
01:28:39,914 --> 01:28:41,748
You want down?

923
01:28:44,386 --> 01:28:47,153
This dog didn't keep you guys up?
She likes to bark at night.

924
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:48,855
She sure does.

925
01:28:48,857 --> 01:28:50,890
Thanks for making pancakes.

926
01:28:57,264 --> 01:29:00,333
About time you got up.
We've been waiting forever.

927
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:02,502
Oh, hey, there he is.
Hey, kiddo.

928
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:04,584
We thought the sugarplum
fairies may have gotten you.

929
01:29:05,539 --> 01:29:08,908
- You're all alive.
- Barely.

930
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:12,679
I haven't felt this hungover
since the pope died.

931
01:29:12,681 --> 01:29:15,782
What's up, buddy? Are you okay?
Yeah, I just-

932
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:21,554
Just had a bad dream, I guess.

933
01:29:23,792 --> 01:29:26,593
Enough with the sappy crap. Let's
open up the damn presents.

934
01:29:26,595 --> 01:29:29,362
Okay. Okay, already. Come on, Linda.
Let's do this.

935
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:30,797
You're gonna help me?

936
01:29:31,932 --> 01:29:33,967
Okay.

937
01:29:33,969 --> 01:29:36,636
Merry Christmas, Max.

938
01:29:36,638 --> 01:29:37,771
Girls.

939
01:29:37,773 --> 01:29:39,472
I got two beverages.

940
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:45,478
- Stevie, sweetheart.
- Thanks, mom.

941
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:52,685
- Oh, ho ho ho!
- Isn't that fun?

942
01:29:53,921 --> 01:29:55,555
Hey, maxi-pad. Training
batting gloves.

943
01:29:57,258 --> 01:29:58,725
What could that possibly be?

944
01:29:58,727 --> 01:30:00,927
Oh, my god!

945
01:30:00,929 --> 01:30:03,129
"Oh, my god" is right. Oh, my...

946
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:06,499
- That's from me and the girls.
- I had to reattach the foot.

947
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:11,237
Yeah, if you look closely, he did a
really good job of reattaching it.

948
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:16,576
Oh, thank you.

949
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:18,244
This is great.

950
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:20,313
Omi, that's beautiful.

951
01:30:20,315 --> 01:30:23,149
Wow. What's this all about?

952
01:30:23,151 --> 01:30:25,819
It's nothing. Just...

953
01:30:25,821 --> 01:30:27,987
Merry Christmas.

954
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:30,423
Oh. Well, merry Christmas
to you too, Max.

955
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:32,158
Merry Christmas, son.

956
01:30:59,787 --> 01:31:03,156
<i>I just wanted Christmas
