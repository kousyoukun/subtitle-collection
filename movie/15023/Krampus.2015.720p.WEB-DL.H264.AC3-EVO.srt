1
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:26,823
<i>I come tonight to warn you
that you will be visited by three spirits.</i>

2
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,976
<i>What?</i>

3
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:33,413
<i>Was that the chance and hope
that you mentioned, Jacob?</i>

4
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,048
<i>It was.</i>

5
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:39,353
<i>You have yet the chance
and hope of escaping my fate.</i>

6
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:42,797
<i>A chance and hope
of my procuring, Ebenezer.</i>

7
00:03:42,897 --> 00:03:44,830
<i>Thank you, Jacob.</i>

8
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,200
<i>Expect the first when the bell tolls 1:00.</i>

9
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,967
- Shut up, Beth!
- I don't care who started it, Max.

10
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:58,057
Ben started it and everybody knows it.
We even have the whole thing on video.

11
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:01,475
You're gonna write an apology to the rest
of your class for ruining the recital.

12
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,377
What were you thinking, Max?
That kid was twice your size.

13
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,130
Yeah, but Ben Kuklinski
is always ragging on Christmas.

14
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,150
He even told the first graders that Santa
was just a cheap marketing ploy

15
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,876
- invented to sell Pepsi.
- Coke.

16
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:14,612
- You know what I mean.
- But not why you care.

17
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:18,158
- Well, someone's got to.
- Here, let me see.

18
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,361
It's not so bad. Just keep icing it.

19
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:25,666
And was drop-kicking him into the manger
really the best way to handle this?

20
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,887
Okay, that was not my fault.
I was under the influence.

21
00:04:28,987 --> 00:04:31,204
All I had to eat was Christmas fudge
and candy canes.

22
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,680
Well, I hate to sound harsh, but every
kid has to learn the truth someday.

23
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:40,313
Oh, I know. I just...
I didn't want it ruined.

24
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,215
For the little kids.

25
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:46,453
<i>But is this a war on Christmas,
a war on over-political correctness...</i>

26
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,572
- Looks great, Mom.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

27
00:04:49,672 --> 00:04:53,006
Don't work too hard, though. Sarah bought
a bunch of cookies at the store.

28
00:04:53,106 --> 00:04:54,694
It's Roger.

29
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,530
Thought you said you
weren't working over Christmas.

30
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,066
I said no traveling over Christmas.
I still have to take a few calls.

31
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,468
Hey, Roger, what's up?

32
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:05,505
Aren't we still gonna watch Charlie Brown
and wrap Christmas presents like always?

33
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,594
You know what? After what you pulled,
you can do that alone. And quick.

34
00:05:08,694 --> 00:05:11,353
Your cousins get here any minute.
Yeah, Roger?

35
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:15,309
- It's a Christmas cluster-eff over here.
- Beth, help me hang this.

36
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,986
Wait. Mom, aren't we
gonna watch Charlie Brown?

37
00:05:28,405 --> 00:05:31,227
<i>Have you finished the letter?</i>

38
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:37,170
I started, but... I don't know
what to ask for this year.

39
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,224
Because they are family, Beth.
And it's only for a few days.

40
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:44,793
Well, I'm not sharing my room
with girls who pee standing up.

41
00:05:44,893 --> 00:05:47,586
<i>I'm sure you will think of something.</i>

42
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:50,153
Last year I found shit in my bed, Mom.

43
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:53,173
- Human shit.
- For the last time, that was their dog!

44
00:05:53,273 --> 00:05:55,439
"They're why some people
shouldn't be allowed to breed!"

45
00:05:55,539 --> 00:06:00,085
- Your words, Mom, not mine!
- I never said that!

46
00:06:01,181 --> 00:06:05,082
I said maybe they should have to take
a test before they're allowed to breed.

47
00:06:28,507 --> 00:06:30,541
Thanks, Omi.

48
00:06:32,444 --> 00:06:34,239
Omi?

49
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:38,415
Do you still really believe in Santa?

50
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:41,063
<i>Naturally.</i>

51
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:46,989
<i>But... I also believe St. Nicholas
is what you make of him.</i>

52
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:49,694
What do you mean?

53
00:06:49,794 --> 00:06:55,437
<i>That to believe in him is...
to believe in the true spirit of the holiday.</i>

54
00:06:55,537 --> 00:06:58,986
<i>The spirit of giving. Of sacrifice...</i>

55
00:07:07,573 --> 00:07:11,696
<i>I also believe in dessert before dinner.</i>

56
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:24,497
Yeah, my cousins are crawling out
of the shallow end of the gene pool,

57
00:07:24,597 --> 00:07:26,566
so everyone's a little on edge.

58
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:30,236
- <i>Your mom popping Xanax again?</i>
- Like candy.

59
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:34,774
Tonight we're making a Japanese
snowflake tree or some crap.

60
00:07:35,474 --> 00:07:38,511
Takes a lot of work to make our family look
more awesome than it actually is, you know?

61
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:42,348
<i>I like snowflakes,
but I like my plan a lot better.</i>

62
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:46,019
Very enticing.

63
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:48,635
- But I think I'm stuck here.
- <i>Come on.</i>

64
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:52,925
<i>People have escaped from Alcatraz before,
and I'm only four blocks away.</i>

65
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:57,373
<i>What? What's wrong?</i>

66
00:07:57,473 --> 00:07:58,997
Everything.

67
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,373
Crap.

68
00:08:14,881 --> 00:08:17,517
- Will you two knock it off?
- Howie, stop ringing the doorbell!

69
00:08:17,617 --> 00:08:20,787
- Well, carry something!
- Help me with the bags.

70
00:08:20,887 --> 00:08:24,824
It's Christmas. It's Christmas.
It's Christmas.

71
00:08:25,424 --> 00:08:28,728
- Merry Christmas!
- Hey, sis. Merry Christmas.

72
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:32,399
- Gosh. I'm so glad you guys could make it.
- Oh, you have no idea.

73
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:36,336
Accidents all over the freeways and nothing
but crazy talk radio for six hours.

74
00:08:36,436 --> 00:08:38,738
We brought you a little taste
of home, though, didn't we?

75
00:08:38,838 --> 00:08:41,832
Well... thank you. It looks...

76
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:43,341
- Wow!
- You're welcome.

77
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:46,205
Linda, move it, move it. We don't have
to keep the traffic jam going.

78
00:08:46,305 --> 00:08:48,415
Howard, let me help you with that.

79
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:50,216
That's...

80
00:08:50,316 --> 00:08:52,585
- Thanks, Tommy.
- Sorry about that.

81
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:54,387
What, you give the Butler
the night off, did you?

82
00:08:54,487 --> 00:08:57,791
- Don't worry about it.
- Yeah, we brought Rosie.

83
00:08:57,891 --> 00:09:01,832
- You don't have a cat, do you?
- It's fine. It's fine, right? It's fine.

84
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:03,669
Merry Christmas, girls. Come on in.

85
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:06,693
Don't you look cute
in your matching jackets.

86
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:10,036
They're just a little cranky
'cause the Steelers lost, so...

87
00:09:10,136 --> 00:09:14,838
Jordan, Stevie, why don't you tell your Aunt
Sarah about your presidential fitness award?

88
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,211
It's a good story.

89
00:09:18,863 --> 00:09:21,181
Hey, Howie.

90
00:09:21,281 --> 00:09:24,517
So, what did you ask Santa for this year?

91
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:26,669
Really nice. They did look pretty good.

92
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:29,622
- It looks bigger in here.
- Toy car?

93
00:09:29,722 --> 00:09:31,524
Look what Max has got in his pocket.

94
00:09:31,624 --> 00:09:33,726
A letter to Santa.

95
00:09:34,426 --> 00:09:36,496
Video games?

96
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:39,761
Phone?

97
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:42,533
Dialysis?

98
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:47,311
- That's a long fucking drive.
- Thank you, guys.

99
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:50,176
Where do you want this stuff, Tom?
Just anywhere?

100
00:09:50,476 --> 00:09:53,513
Christ on a stick.
Would it kill you to shovel your walk?

101
00:09:53,613 --> 00:09:55,582
I could have broken a hip out there.

102
00:09:55,782 --> 00:09:59,018
Surprise! Please don't be mad.

103
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,090
Aunt Dorothy. It's so great to see you.

104
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,293
Yeah, well, your sister's
no Mother Teresa,

105
00:10:07,393 --> 00:10:10,296
but at least she swings by
every once in a while

106
00:10:10,396 --> 00:10:12,632
to make sure that I'm not dead.

107
00:10:12,732 --> 00:10:16,469
So, where's the nog? I need to get merry.

108
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:19,055
It's in the kitchen. Help yourself.

109
00:10:19,155 --> 00:10:20,941
- Oh, Tom, let me take that.
- I'm sorry.

110
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,910
- That's okay. That's okay.
- Lord Almighty.

111
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,346
Looks like Martha Stewart
threw up in here.

112
00:10:26,446 --> 00:10:30,950
- We left the door open. Sorry about that.
- We're such a mess, honestly.

113
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,516
Six hours, I mean, come on.

114
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:37,388
Sorry. Wasn't there another...

115
00:10:38,457 --> 00:10:41,261
- Child?
- Chrissy! Darn it!

116
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:43,430
Jordan, I told you to bring her inside.

117
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,565
- Not my kid.
- Come on, girls.

118
00:10:45,665 --> 00:10:48,235
Tommy, help me get the baby
and the rest of the girl crap out.

119
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:52,871
- Do you mind? Thank you.
- Let's make some memories?

120
00:10:53,127 --> 00:10:56,094
Thank you, honey. Thank you.
Oh, my goodness.

121
00:10:56,194 --> 00:10:59,812
A holiday roast is a surprise.
Hemorrhoids are a surprise.

122
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:02,682
She is a goddamn nightmare.
What were you thinking?

123
00:11:02,782 --> 00:11:06,152
Come on, she's not that bad. She's not!

124
00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:08,231
Besides, she tricked me, okay?

125
00:11:08,331 --> 00:11:11,457
I thought we were just dropping off gifts,
and she came to the door with a suitcase.

126
00:11:11,557 --> 00:11:13,926
What was I supposed to do, tell her
she has to spend Christmas by herself?

127
00:11:14,026 --> 00:11:16,802
No, but at least you could have
warned me when one of your mistakes

128
00:11:16,902 --> 00:11:21,234
- is gonna become my problem.
- You think everything I do is a mistake.

129
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:24,103
- Well...
- Sorry. Look out. Look out.

130
00:11:24,203 --> 00:11:27,093
Hey, honey. I think this warhead's armed.

131
00:11:27,193 --> 00:11:31,945
You're so stinky. Okay, I'm gonna
go change her. Let's go this way.

132
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:35,092
Just set that up wherever you want, T.

133
00:11:35,192 --> 00:11:38,002
The whole truck smells like shit.

134
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:41,601
So, what's for dinner?

135
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,589
That's my boy!

136
00:11:56,689 --> 00:12:00,173
- That's my boy!
- It sure is.

137
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:02,208
I'm getting Howie Junior into game shape.

138
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:06,746
By the time he gets to high school, he's
gonna be the biggest lineman in the state.

139
00:12:07,146 --> 00:12:10,316
Did you ever spend any time
on the field, Tommy?

140
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:14,254
No, actually, I didn't have time in my
younger years. I was in training mostly.

141
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:19,122
What were you training for? Army? Marines?

142
00:12:19,658 --> 00:12:22,562
- It was the Eagle Scouts.
- Eagle Scouts.

143
00:12:23,162 --> 00:12:26,462
Now, Eagle Scouts, kids,
that's where you weave baskets

144
00:12:26,562 --> 00:12:29,338
and help little old ladies
across the street. Am I right?

145
00:12:29,438 --> 00:12:31,263
No, no.

146
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:35,391
No, no, no. It was actually quite
a bit of... survival training.

147
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:40,046
Well, the only survival training
I need is my old smoke pole

148
00:12:40,146 --> 00:12:43,650
and a big, fat box of buckshot
that I keep out in that truck.

149
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,619
A shepherd has got to protect his flock.

150
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:50,289
Honey, we said no gun talk
at the dinner table.

151
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:54,655
This family needs a little gun talk, whether
it's at the dinner table or anywhere else.

152
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:55,835
You know what I'm saying?

153
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,998
Looks like Chrissy's
really enjoying my gravlax.

154
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,603
Careful. Remember that your Aunt Sarah
likes everything to be clean and perfect,

155
00:13:03,703 --> 00:13:07,040
and that's why she makes so much
food that you can't pronounce.

156
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,643
I just thought you guys might like a break
from macaroni and cheese with hot dogs.

157
00:13:10,743 --> 00:13:13,613
- Yeah, okay.
- Well, you were wrong.

158
00:13:13,713 --> 00:13:18,082
And who doesn't make a ham at Christmas?
What are you now, a Jew?

159
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,971
Maybe it's time for dessert?

160
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,360
- It's delicious, honey.
- It's a little dry.

161
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,743
Okay. Well, mine's delicious.

162
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:35,539
- I guess I should have gotten your bird.
- You could just say something nice.

163
00:13:35,739 --> 00:13:38,071
I'll say it when she gets back
if dessert's good.

164
00:13:38,171 --> 00:13:40,451
- If you could just do me a favor.
- Tell him about Santa.

165
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:44,618
- Just say something nice about dessert.
- Hey. Maxi-pad.

166
00:13:44,718 --> 00:13:46,680
Hear what happened to Santa?

167
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,665
No, Stevie. What happened to Santa?

168
00:13:48,765 --> 00:13:52,352
Heard it on the news.
His sleigh crashed in the rockies.

169
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:54,821
Shattered both his legs.

170
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:57,590
Frostbite took care of his pain
but not his hunger.

171
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:02,459
So, to survive, he had to slaughter
and eat his reindeer.

172
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:06,231
Including Rudolph.

173
00:14:06,331 --> 00:14:09,679
"Ate" tiny reindeer. Get it?

174
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,107
- Knock it off!
- Don't start anything.

175
00:14:14,307 --> 00:14:18,975
- Hey, guys, take it easy.
- They're just playing, Tommy.

176
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:27,987
Macaroni and cheese
and hot dogs. Oh, Jesus.

177
00:14:28,087 --> 00:14:31,808
So what kind of godforsaken concoction
are you whipping up now?

178
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:35,244
You know how this fancy food
clogs my pipes.

179
00:14:35,344 --> 00:14:38,381
Well, how about we go to your trailer
for Christmas next year?

180
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:42,618
And after you spent weeks
decorating and cooking and cleaning,

181
00:14:42,718 --> 00:14:44,387
I might just waddle in
and start bitching and moaning

182
00:14:44,487 --> 00:14:46,289
about everything you've worked so hard on.

183
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:49,125
- Sarah, you know...
- No, Aunt Dorothy, please.

184
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:53,727
For your sake, just...
stay the hell out of my kitchen.

185
00:14:56,865 --> 00:14:59,969
You know, reindeer are actually
a sustainable food source

186
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:02,972
in the northern territories,
in Alaska, Canada.

187
00:15:03,072 --> 00:15:06,951
This time of year, we refer to reindeer as

188
00:15:07,051 --> 00:15:09,877
a transportation system for Santa Claus.

189
00:15:10,846 --> 00:15:13,966
We know you still believe
in the big, fat creeper.

190
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:16,068
I don't know what you're talking about.

191
00:15:17,188 --> 00:15:19,246
You sure about that?

192
00:15:19,954 --> 00:15:21,588
Max, stop.

193
00:15:23,058 --> 00:15:25,157
"Dear Santa,

194
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,664
I know I haven't been great
this year, and I'm sorry for that,

195
00:15:28,764 --> 00:15:32,868
but I was really hoping you could help
out me and my family this Christmas.

196
00:15:32,968 --> 00:15:36,081
We need you."
Oh, Maxi-pad, that's so sweet.

197
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:38,441
- Give it back!
- Stop, Max.

198
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:42,900
Blah, blah, blah, bullshit, bullshit.
Here we go... Maxi's wish list.

199
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,882
- Stevie, stop. That's enough.
- Wait, you're up first, Beth.

200
00:15:45,982 --> 00:15:49,619
"I wish me and Beth could
hang out like we used to.

201
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:52,622
You might have noticed
that I don't have tons of friends."

202
00:15:52,722 --> 00:15:55,291
Oh, no, really, Max?

203
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,855
"I wish my mom and dad
could fall in love again.

204
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:03,299
I know they get upset a lot,
with Dad away from home so much.

205
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,900
I think they really just miss each other."

206
00:16:07,803 --> 00:16:14,213
"Also, I wish things weren't so hard
for Uncle Howard and Aunt Linda.

207
00:16:16,411 --> 00:16:20,114
So maybe you can lend them
a hand the rest of the year too.

208
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,936
And...

209
00:16:25,036 --> 00:16:28,925
And that..." screw you.
Dad does not wish we were boys.

210
00:16:29,475 --> 00:16:32,877
Okay, who wants crème brûlée?

211
00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:40,503
- Give me the letter! Give it back!
- Hey, Max. Hey. Hey!

212
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:43,605
- Hey!
- Girls!

213
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:48,277
- Hey!
- Hey!

214
00:16:48,577 --> 00:16:52,682
- Come on, Howard. Stevie, Jordan.
- All right, all right, that's enough.

215
00:16:52,782 --> 00:16:56,085
- Are you okay? Honey?
- Enough. Enough.

216
00:16:56,535 --> 00:17:00,153
I just wanted Christmas to be like it used
to be, but forget it. I hate Christmas!

217
00:17:00,403 --> 00:17:04,226
- I hate all of you!
- Max. Max!

218
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:09,063
Oh, lay off of him. Kid deserves
a prize just for telling the truth.

219
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:22,178
- Can I come in?
- No.

220
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:26,077
You know, they're leaving
right after Christmas,

221
00:17:26,177 --> 00:17:30,252
so we only have to survive
another... three days.

222
00:17:30,352 --> 00:17:33,222
I don't get it. Every year it gets worse.

223
00:17:33,322 --> 00:17:36,957
Why do we have to put up with their
crap just because we share DNA?

224
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:42,298
Because that's what a family is, Max.

225
00:17:42,398 --> 00:17:44,266
People you try to be friends with

226
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:46,769
even though you don't have
a whole lot in common.

227
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:49,984
- But why?
- Because.

228
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:51,982
Well...

229
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:55,643
Okay, you kind of got me there.

230
00:17:57,113 --> 00:17:58,188
Or...

231
00:17:58,288 --> 00:18:01,975
maybe it makes us work a little harder to
find what we do have in common, you know.

232
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:05,651
Put everything aside,
think of other people for a change.

233
00:18:05,921 --> 00:18:08,457
Friends, family,

234
00:18:08,557 --> 00:18:10,826
even the assholes
you normally can't stand.

235
00:18:10,926 --> 00:18:14,462
- Like Uncle Howard?
- Didn't wanna name names.

236
00:18:16,197 --> 00:18:20,033
Dad, do you really believe in all that?

237
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:22,570
I want to, Max.

238
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:27,042
But, hey,

239
00:18:27,142 --> 00:18:30,544
bet there's still time to drop
that letter in the mailbox?

240
00:20:27,595 --> 00:20:30,800
Don't you find it the least bit strange?
They can see dust specks on Mars,

241
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,803
but no one noticed a giant blizzard
hurtling towards us.

242
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:35,705
Well, as soon as the power's back,

243
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:38,708
you can write an angry e-mail
to the National Weather Service.

244
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:40,977
But in the meantime,
let's just try and stay calm.

245
00:20:41,077 --> 00:20:43,513
- Mom, there's something weird outside.
- I am calm.

246
00:20:43,613 --> 00:20:47,021
I would just be calmer if I knew how we were
gonna survive Christmas with 12 people

247
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:50,953
stuck in a house with no hot water,
no heat and no electricity.

248
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:55,457
- Or food.
- Well, there's plenty of leftovers, Howard.

249
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:58,811
- Beer it is.
- Phone's dead too.

250
00:20:58,911 --> 00:21:00,129
- Mom!
- What, Max?

251
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:02,835
There's a snowman in our yard.

252
00:21:03,964 --> 00:21:05,833
See?

253
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:11,390
- That's... that's great, Max.
- But who built it?

254
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:15,712
You can barely see across the street,
but it doesn't look like it's just us.

255
00:21:16,312 --> 00:21:19,849
- I can walk over, check with the Turners.
- The Turners are in Hawaii.

256
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:22,551
The Lamberts are in Florida,
and the Cartwrights stopped talking to us

257
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:26,222
- after Max's noodle incident.
- After his what?

258
00:21:26,322 --> 00:21:30,658
Please go and get Omi out of the fireplace
before she burns the whole house down.

259
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:35,965
- I'll get it!
- Fine.

260
00:21:36,265 --> 00:21:38,816
Seriously, what are we gonna do?

261
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:42,722
- Merry Christmas. Sign here.
- Yeah.

262
00:21:44,275 --> 00:21:47,973
Honey, stuff to carry! Some weather?

263
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,347
Yeah. It's a ghost town out there.
Roads are a nightmare.

264
00:21:51,447 --> 00:21:54,449
Yeah, no kidding. Hey, these too?

265
00:21:54,942 --> 00:21:57,502
Not mine. Must be from the boys in Brown.

266
00:21:57,602 --> 00:21:58,895
- All right.
- Merry Christmas.

267
00:21:58,995 --> 00:22:00,823
Yeah, you too.

268
00:22:01,381 --> 00:22:03,459
- What is it?
- Hey, look at this?

269
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:06,148
- What?
- They got more stuff.

270
00:22:06,248 --> 00:22:08,184
How come rich people
get all the free shit?

271
00:22:08,284 --> 00:22:11,819
I don't know, honey. Democrats, probably.

272
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,354
Oh, my God!

273
00:22:16,258 --> 00:22:18,407
Who needs this much cheese?

274
00:22:18,507 --> 00:22:20,643
One singular moment.

275
00:22:20,743 --> 00:22:24,026
I've texted Derek, like, nine times
and he still hasn't written back.

276
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:25,514
That is not normal.

277
00:22:25,614 --> 00:22:27,983
It's the blizzard, honey.
Nothing's working right now.

278
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:31,120
Can I walk over and check on him?
It's only a few blocks.

279
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,489
I don't think that's a good idea.

280
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:36,039
I could see if anyone else
has power on the way.

281
00:22:36,139 --> 00:22:38,560
She'll be fine.

282
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,558
Okay. One hour.

283
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:43,799
When you get back, I want you to spend
some girl time with Jordan and Stevie.

284
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:45,067
Got it?

285
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:49,405
You call that a reversal?
Come on, Jordy, plant your feet!

286
00:22:49,505 --> 00:22:51,607
- Plant your feet. All right.
- Right.

287
00:22:52,207 --> 00:22:54,476
- You know what I mean.
- Thanks.

288
00:22:54,576 --> 00:22:57,479
- Be careful, okay?
- Okay. Back later.

289
00:22:57,579 --> 00:23:00,282
Love you. One hour.

290
00:23:00,382 --> 00:23:02,249
Okay.

291
00:23:04,152 --> 00:23:07,654
Max, I told you to get Omi out of the...

292
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:21,801
She says hot chocolate
makes everything better.

293
00:24:42,449 --> 00:24:43,951
Oh, my God.

294
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:53,293
Please!

295
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:00,450
Somebody help me!

296
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,721
Please! Daddy!

297
00:25:08,262 --> 00:25:09,627
Help!

298
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:30,985
Get anything?

299
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:32,953
No.

300
00:27:34,355 --> 00:27:39,259
It's the weirdest thing. There's no cars,
no people, not even a salt truck.

301
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:44,241
Don't suppose you got me a backup
generator for Christmas, did you?

302
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:48,203
Yeah, it's under the tree
next to your ties and underwear.

303
00:27:48,303 --> 00:27:50,170
Good.

304
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:57,146
It's getting late.

305
00:27:57,546 --> 00:28:01,017
- Beth should be home by now.
- She's fine. She's at Derek's.

306
00:28:01,117 --> 00:28:06,720
- All the more reason to worry.
- Hey, hon, relax. Just for once, okay?

307
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:12,427
How's everybody else doing?

308
00:28:12,527 --> 00:28:17,966
You know, cranky, bored, sick of the snow.

309
00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:20,368
- And each other.
- 'Tis the season.

310
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:28,582
Oh, God, I miss us.

311
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,912
Me too.

312
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,823
Mom, Dad.

313
00:28:43,658 --> 00:28:45,993
It's already dark out
and Beth isn't back yet.

314
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:56,338
Hey, Howard. Do you think your Hummer
could get through this mess?

315
00:28:56,438 --> 00:28:59,942
Lucinda? I could point her
due east, hit the gas

316
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:04,083
and she'd be storming the beaches at
Normandy by sunrise. What's on your mind, T?

317
00:29:04,183 --> 00:29:08,317
Well, it's Beth. She went to her boyfriend's
earlier and she hasn't come back yet.

318
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:13,388
See? Let them out of your sight for one
second, and boom, shotgun wedding.

319
00:29:13,488 --> 00:29:17,209
- Aunt Dorothy, please.
- Well, you ought to know.

320
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:21,296
It's probably nothing,
but I thought we'd go pick her up,

321
00:29:21,396 --> 00:29:24,066
take a quick swing around town,
see what's going on out there.

322
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:27,002
A little recon mission?
Thought you'd never ask.

323
00:29:27,602 --> 00:29:29,566
- Okay.
- Go to mama.

324
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:31,089
- Yep.
- All righty.

325
00:29:31,189 --> 00:29:33,631
Thomas. Thomas.

326
00:29:36,153 --> 00:29:40,213
- What? Why?
- What the hell is she so riled up about?

327
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:45,821
She says not to go.

328
00:29:45,921 --> 00:29:48,123
That it's too dangerous, and that we
should wait until the storm's over.

329
00:29:48,223 --> 00:29:50,807
- Tom.
- No, I got this. Hey, Mom...

330
00:29:50,907 --> 00:29:55,398
we have to go pick up Beth, but Max and
Sarah will take care of you while I'm gone.

331
00:29:55,498 --> 00:29:57,331
Mom. Hey, Mom, listen.

332
00:30:01,702 --> 00:30:04,170
Everything's gonna be okay.

333
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:28,285
Global warming, my ass.

334
00:30:28,385 --> 00:30:30,766
Must be negative 20 out here.

335
00:30:30,866 --> 00:30:32,868
This just doesn't make any sense.

336
00:30:32,968 --> 00:30:36,306
- You try AM?
- Yeah, I tried everything.

337
00:30:36,406 --> 00:30:39,640
The storm probably knocked out
the radio stations too.

338
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,190
I guess so.

339
00:30:42,129 --> 00:30:46,079
What I wouldn't give for a little
Bing Crosby right about now.

340
00:30:52,507 --> 00:30:55,656
All right, slow down. What is that?

341
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:08,334
Is that a snowplow?

342
00:31:17,594 --> 00:31:19,429
Hello?

343
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,456
Christ.

344
00:31:44,906 --> 00:31:47,609
Poor bastard must have
sailed clear through.

345
00:31:48,284 --> 00:31:50,545
Looks more like the opposite.

346
00:31:50,845 --> 00:31:52,347
What do you mean?

347
00:31:52,447 --> 00:31:55,135
The glass is punched in.

348
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:10,698
We got to find Beth.

349
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:17,272
You packed guns on Christmas.

350
00:32:17,372 --> 00:32:20,340
Always be prepared, boy scout.

351
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:24,062
- It's kind of heavy.
- Yeah.

352
00:32:24,662 --> 00:32:26,947
It's Linda's.

353
00:32:38,025 --> 00:32:40,093
Oh, my gosh.

354
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:43,231
You had Mom's angel this whole time?

355
00:32:43,331 --> 00:32:47,234
- Yeah. I thought you knew.
- No.

356
00:32:50,572 --> 00:32:52,911
Remember we used to fight
over who got to place her?

357
00:32:53,011 --> 00:32:57,212
Yeah. You fought dirty.
I think I still have the scars.

358
00:32:57,512 --> 00:33:00,213
Where do you think my girls get it from?

359
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:08,455
You saved everything.

360
00:33:08,555 --> 00:33:10,358
Yeah.

361
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:13,960
I figured that's what Mom
would have done, you know.

362
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:26,407
Mom?

363
00:33:29,543 --> 00:33:33,514
- Probably just squirrels.
- In this weather?

364
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:04,445
See?

365
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:08,896
- Squirrels.
- Right. Probably playing with their nuts.

366
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:27,922
Beth?

367
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:37,144
Derek!

368
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:43,795
- Beth!
- Quiet, Tommy. I don't like this.

369
00:35:06,173 --> 00:35:10,243
Whoever did this
is a demented son of a bitch.

370
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:21,622
Don't worry. We'll find her, buddy.

371
00:35:32,332 --> 00:35:35,034
Looks like a gas line blew.

372
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:46,680
What's that?

373
00:35:50,617 --> 00:35:53,193
I've hunted a lot of game in my day.

374
00:35:53,293 --> 00:35:56,374
Those are hooves. Big ones too.

375
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:59,027
Could be an elk or a goat.

376
00:35:59,127 --> 00:36:02,629
What kind of goat walks on its hind legs?

377
00:36:08,535 --> 00:36:10,336
Beth!

378
00:36:11,605 --> 00:36:14,397
- Beth!
- Help me!

379
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:16,743
Beth!

380
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,182
Beth!

381
00:36:24,084 --> 00:36:25,919
Beth!

382
00:36:27,154 --> 00:36:29,324
- Beth!
- Tommy!

383
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,859
Wait up!

384
00:36:41,502 --> 00:36:42,970
Howard!

385
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:51,813
- Oh, my God!
- Hold on, Howard!

386
00:36:51,913 --> 00:36:55,281
Help! Oh, God! Help me!

387
00:36:57,552 --> 00:36:59,197
Tommy!

388
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,807
Something... something's biting me!

389
00:37:02,907 --> 00:37:04,408
Don't let go!

390
00:37:10,597 --> 00:37:11,766
Tommy?

391
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:25,797
- Let's go!
- What was that thing?

392
00:37:25,897 --> 00:37:28,764
I don't know, but we have to move!

393
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:38,191
Oh, my God.

394
00:37:41,194 --> 00:37:43,697
Lucinda!

395
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:49,721
- Where do you think you're going?
- To find them. I don't like this.

396
00:37:50,071 --> 00:37:53,057
What are you talking about? Tom and Howard
know what they're doing. They're fine.

397
00:37:53,157 --> 00:37:55,186
- Are they?
- Mom?

398
00:37:55,476 --> 00:37:58,446
Honey, I'll be right back.
I promise. Just lock the...

399
00:37:58,546 --> 00:37:59,765
Oh, God!

400
00:37:59,865 --> 00:38:02,433
Max, get the first aid kit!
Sarah, lock the door!

401
00:38:02,537 --> 00:38:05,565
Girls! Make some room for your dad!

402
00:38:05,665 --> 00:38:08,376
- Shut the door!
- Where's Beth? We heard gunshots!

403
00:38:08,756 --> 00:38:11,709
I'll explain everything, but right now
everybody just needs to stay calm

404
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:14,196
- and stay inside!
- And get away from the windows!

405
00:38:14,296 --> 00:38:17,031
Swords, guns, knives, pots, pans!
Get whatever you can...

406
00:38:17,131 --> 00:38:18,519
- Howard!
- What?

407
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:20,934
Not here.

408
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:25,067
Jiminy Christmas. What happened out there?

409
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:28,810
Nothing. It's just a scratch.

410
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,579
- My God. It looks like something bit you.
- Nope.

411
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:33,882
Probably a bear trap
under the snow or something.

412
00:38:34,232 --> 00:38:36,465
We don't have bears here.

413
00:38:38,785 --> 00:38:40,588
Okay.

414
00:38:40,888 --> 00:38:43,558
Kids, why don't you go into the kitchen
and get something to eat now.

415
00:38:43,658 --> 00:38:45,043
You just don't wanna tell us
what's going on here!

416
00:38:45,143 --> 00:38:49,934
- Everybody into the kitchen right now, Max.
- Come on. Let's go. Girls, come on.

417
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:52,942
Aunt Dorothy,
will you keep an eye on them?

418
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:56,670
Why me? I never liked kids,
even when I was one.

419
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:02,543
- Please.
- Oh, all right.

420
00:39:02,643 --> 00:39:04,512
All right!

421
00:39:04,612 --> 00:39:08,048
Come on, guys. I'm gonna teach you
how to make peppermint schnapps.

422
00:39:12,202 --> 00:39:17,741
Mom. Mom, will you please go into
the kitchen and help with the kids?

423
00:39:21,933 --> 00:39:24,265
<i>Keep the fire hot.</i>

424
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:28,968
Come here, baby.

425
00:39:30,637 --> 00:39:35,243
See? A little sugar and a little spice...

426
00:39:36,978 --> 00:39:40,313
makes everything nice.

427
00:39:49,323 --> 00:39:52,825
All right. But don't you rat me out.

428
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:58,084
Who or what did all this?

429
00:39:58,584 --> 00:40:01,021
Your guess is as good as mine.

430
00:40:02,036 --> 00:40:04,305
First I thought it was a gang thing.

431
00:40:04,405 --> 00:40:07,735
But between this and all
the crazy stuff we saw out here,

432
00:40:07,835 --> 00:40:11,079
- it just doesn't add up.
- It could be terrorists, right?

433
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:15,149
Yeah, terrorists. Maybe traded their
suicide vests for rabid snow dogs?

434
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:16,651
Tommy!

435
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:19,372
- Tom, God!
- Sorry. Sorry.

436
00:40:19,472 --> 00:40:21,354
And...

437
00:40:21,972 --> 00:40:23,941
- Beth?
- Okay.

438
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:27,448
She wasn't at Derek's, but that doesn't mean
anything. She may have found somewhere safe.

439
00:40:27,548 --> 00:40:30,251
- So she's still out there.
- Yes. And we will find her. I promise.

440
00:40:30,351 --> 00:40:32,901
I had to make sure you guys were safe.
I had to get Howard...

441
00:40:33,001 --> 00:40:35,436
I don't care how long it takes, Tom.
We have to keep looking.

442
00:40:35,536 --> 00:40:39,587
- We have to pair up and take turns...
- We can't go back out there! You see this?

443
00:40:39,697 --> 00:40:43,211
- It's damn near frostbite in under four minutes!
- Honey, keep your voice down.

444
00:40:43,311 --> 00:40:45,180
Besides it being subzero out there,

445
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,783
someone's tearing through your fancy-ass
neighborhood picking everybody off.

446
00:40:48,883 --> 00:40:50,757
- It's the truth!
- Honey...

447
00:40:50,857 --> 00:40:52,620
Listen, why don't we just leave? Right?

448
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,490
We can all pile in the truck and we'll
just see as far as we can get and...

449
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:59,494
- The truck's gone. Torn to pieces.
- What?

450
00:40:59,594 --> 00:41:02,597
Yeah. And even if she wasn't,
the streets are totally screwed.

451
00:41:02,697 --> 00:41:05,433
We can't go anywhere.
It's too dangerous. You got it?

452
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:08,369
Howard, how much ammo do you have?

453
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:12,306
A couple shells still loaded,
maybe a dozen in my pocket. Why?

454
00:41:12,506 --> 00:41:15,409
I think our best bet is to stay put.

455
00:41:15,509 --> 00:41:18,076
Board up all the doors and windows.

456
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,440
And as soon as the weather breaks,
we'll go find her.

457
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,114
I told you we should've gone
to my brother's.

458
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:25,328
- Sure, Howard. Christmas on a pig farm.
- Jesus was born in a barn!

459
00:41:25,428 --> 00:41:28,166
Knock it off! What about the kids?
What are we gonna tell them?

460
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:31,392
- I don't know. The truth?
- Sure. Which version of it?

461
00:41:32,292 --> 00:41:34,212
- Hey, you guys.
- Oh, God.

462
00:41:34,312 --> 00:41:37,799
- How much did you hear?
- Enough.

463
00:41:37,999 --> 00:41:40,883
- Mama, did someone take Beth?
- Are they coming for us?

464
00:41:40,983 --> 00:41:42,899
No. No, babies, no.

465
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:46,491
Everything's fine. Beth's just
with her boyfriend, that's all.

466
00:41:46,591 --> 00:41:49,244
And nothing bad's gonna happen
on Christmas, right?

467
00:41:49,444 --> 00:41:52,313
You know what? Let's have a campout, okay?
We'll watch a movie. Yeah?

468
00:41:52,413 --> 00:41:56,280
Let's get cozy on the couch. Go get
your sister. Come on, baby. Come on.

469
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,018
We'll find her, I promise.

470
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:06,861
<i>"And lo, the angel
of the Lord came upon them.</i>

471
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:09,931
<i>And the glory of the Lord
shone round about them.</i>

472
00:42:10,031 --> 00:42:13,699
<i>And they were so afraid.
And the angel said unto them...</i>

473
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:16,504
<i>'fear not. For behold, I bring
you tidings of great joy.'"</i>

474
00:42:16,604 --> 00:42:19,040
Won't the battery die?

475
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:23,475
Got to die sometime.
Might as well enjoy it while we can.

476
00:42:27,414 --> 00:42:28,950
Hey.

477
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:31,752
Beth's a tough girl.

478
00:42:32,285 --> 00:42:34,655
Takes after her Mom.

479
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:37,320
I'm sure she's fine.

480
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,492
Thank you.

481
00:42:47,133 --> 00:42:49,936
Hey, Tommy. I...

482
00:42:52,606 --> 00:42:56,744
I just wanna say thanks for... you know,

483
00:42:56,844 --> 00:42:59,307
saving my ass back there.

484
00:42:59,407 --> 00:43:01,875
Oh. Well...

485
00:43:01,975 --> 00:43:04,750
sure. No problem.

486
00:43:09,989 --> 00:43:13,292
And I just wanna say I'm sorry for...

487
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:17,663
thinking you're such
a spineless dick all these years.

488
00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:21,434
Yeah.

489
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:29,126
- You should get some sleep, pal.
- How?

490
00:43:29,226 --> 00:43:30,714
Good point.

491
00:43:35,448 --> 00:43:37,199
Hey, Dad.

492
00:43:37,799 --> 00:43:40,053
Are we gonna die?

493
00:43:40,153 --> 00:43:43,121
Hey. No, no.

494
00:43:44,007 --> 00:43:45,874
No.

495
00:43:47,393 --> 00:43:49,828
Omi's been acting different.

496
00:43:50,096 --> 00:43:52,066
Ever since the storm.

497
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:54,541
Yeah, well, you know...

498
00:43:57,837 --> 00:44:00,973
She always gets a little weird
around Christmas.

499
00:44:01,908 --> 00:44:02,943
How come?

500
00:44:03,043 --> 00:44:06,012
I don't know. She never
wanted to talk about it.

501
00:44:06,112 --> 00:44:09,249
Max, come on. Time for bed.

502
00:44:10,633 --> 00:44:12,402
It's going to be fine.

503
00:44:18,925 --> 00:44:20,460
All right.

504
00:44:34,974 --> 00:44:38,911
You know, Linda and I,
we butt heads, but...

505
00:44:39,646 --> 00:44:42,781
I can't imagine life without her.

506
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:47,252
Yeah, I know what you mean.

507
00:44:47,555 --> 00:44:50,656
One of us should probably
stay up and keep watch.

508
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:53,681
That's a good idea. I'll go first.

509
00:44:53,781 --> 00:44:56,430
No. You go ahead and catch
some winks with your family.

510
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:59,199
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

511
00:44:59,966 --> 00:45:03,002
A shepherd has got to protect his flock.

512
00:45:03,937 --> 00:45:06,740
- Night, Howard.
- Good night.

513
00:48:16,062 --> 00:48:19,299
- Howie!
- Dad! Dad!

514
00:48:21,033 --> 00:48:23,569
Hang on, Howie!

515
00:48:23,686 --> 00:48:25,756
Dad! Dad!

516
00:48:26,743 --> 00:48:28,776
Sarah! Hold on, Sarah!

517
00:48:28,876 --> 00:48:31,822
- Mom!
- Call 911!

518
00:48:44,223 --> 00:48:46,288
Hold on!

519
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,037
- Max, get the fire extinguisher!
- Pull!

520
00:48:58,771 --> 00:49:01,276
Help me! Help me!

521
00:49:06,779 --> 00:49:08,848
I got you!

522
00:49:19,225 --> 00:49:20,795
Howie!

523
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,614
Howie!

524
00:49:22,714 --> 00:49:25,327
No, no, no!

525
00:49:34,073 --> 00:49:36,609
Oh, geez.

526
00:49:40,848 --> 00:49:44,421
Honey, are you okay? Are you hurt? Hon?

527
00:49:45,685 --> 00:49:49,123
What... unholy thing was that?

528
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:54,722
Howard. Howard.

529
00:49:56,195 --> 00:49:57,760
- It's my fault.
- No.

530
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:02,970
I fell asleep, and they got our boy.
It's all my fault.

531
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:04,479
<i>Nein.</i>

532
00:50:13,045 --> 00:50:15,107
Tom, what's she saying?

533
00:50:15,207 --> 00:50:20,587
"This is all of our fault.
He's come for us all?"

534
00:50:20,953 --> 00:50:23,964
He? Who... Who's he?

535
00:50:24,064 --> 00:50:26,360
I don't know.
Mom, what are you talking about?

536
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:30,857
- Please, listen.
- English. I knew it.

537
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:34,023
I must tell you something.

538
00:50:34,123 --> 00:50:36,336
To all of you.

539
00:50:38,371 --> 00:50:42,449
It started with the wind.

540
00:50:45,479 --> 00:50:50,016
<i>On a cold winter night, much like this.</i>

541
00:50:50,917 --> 00:50:53,787
<i>It was almost Christmas.</i>

542
00:50:54,487 --> 00:50:57,991
<i>But this Christmas was darker,</i>

543
00:50:58,091 --> 00:51:00,293
<i>less cheerful.</i>

544
00:51:02,428 --> 00:51:06,232
<i>But I still believed in Santa,</i>

545
00:51:06,766 --> 00:51:08,736
<i>in magic,</i>

546
00:51:09,136 --> 00:51:11,472
<i>and miracles</i>

547
00:51:11,972 --> 00:51:16,810
<i>and the hope that we could find joy again.</i>

548
00:51:17,877 --> 00:51:19,947
<i>But our village had given up</i>

549
00:51:20,047 --> 00:51:23,264
<i>on miracles and on each other.</i>

550
00:51:27,019 --> 00:51:30,357
<i>They had forgotten
the spirit of Christmas,</i>

551
00:51:30,457 --> 00:51:33,293
<i>the sacrifice of giving.</i>

552
00:51:35,361 --> 00:51:39,432
<i>And my family was no different.</i>

553
00:51:42,735 --> 00:51:46,106
<i>I tried to help them to believe again,</i>

554
00:51:46,206 --> 00:51:51,377
<i>but we were no longer
the loving family I remembered.</i>

555
00:51:54,313 --> 00:51:57,550
<i>They too had given up.</i>

556
00:51:58,584 --> 00:52:02,522
<i>And eventually, so did I.</i>

557
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:07,394
<i>And for the first time,</i>

558
00:52:07,494 --> 00:52:10,497
<i>I didn't wish for a miracle.</i>

559
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:14,501
<i>I wished for them to go away.</i>

560
00:52:15,268 --> 00:52:19,266
<i>A wish I would come to regret.</i>

561
00:52:21,508 --> 00:52:23,410
<i>And that night,</i>

562
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:27,081
<i>in the darkness of a howling blizzard,</i>

563
00:52:27,181 --> 00:52:30,416
<i>I got my wish.</i>

564
00:52:33,887 --> 00:52:39,459
<i>I knew Saint Nicholas
was not coming this year.</i>

565
00:52:41,761 --> 00:52:44,932
<i>Instead it was a much darker,</i>

566
00:52:45,032 --> 00:52:48,535
<i>more ancient spirit.</i>

567
00:52:51,303 --> 00:52:54,608
<i>The shadow of Saint Nicholas.</i>

568
00:52:54,708 --> 00:52:57,710
<i>It was Krampus.</i>

569
00:52:59,245 --> 00:53:03,397
<i>And as he had for thousands of years,</i>

570
00:53:03,497 --> 00:53:07,888
<i>Krampus came not to reward, but to punish.</i>

571
00:53:07,988 --> 00:53:12,792
<i>Not to give, but to take.</i>

572
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:17,029
<i>He and his helpers.</i>

573
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:22,640
<i>I could only listen
as they dragged my family</i>

574
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,872
<i>into the underworld,</i>

575
00:53:24,972 --> 00:53:28,909
<i>knowing that I would be next.</i>

576
00:53:30,477 --> 00:53:35,448
<i>But Krampus didn't take me that night.</i>

577
00:53:36,415 --> 00:53:39,119
<i>He left me as a reminder</i>

578
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:43,523
<i>of what happens when hope is lost,</i>

579
00:53:43,623 --> 00:53:46,894
<i>when belief is forgotten</i>

580
00:53:46,994 --> 00:53:51,267
<i>and the Christmas spirit dies.</i>

581
00:54:06,378 --> 00:54:08,415
And here I thought
I was the one losing it.

582
00:54:08,515 --> 00:54:10,717
- Howard.
- What?

583
00:54:10,817 --> 00:54:13,653
- You believe this senile horseshit?
- I don't know.

584
00:54:13,753 --> 00:54:16,990
Evil Santa? Jesus H. Almighty.

585
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:20,127
She'll be yammering about a rabid
easter bunny come spring.

586
00:54:20,227 --> 00:54:22,510
Howard, that's enough.

587
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:27,367
You damn right it's enough.

588
00:54:27,467 --> 00:54:30,437
Whoever the hell's messing with us
took my boy and your daughter,

589
00:54:30,537 --> 00:54:34,789
and we're sitting around listening
to some twisted bedtime story?

590
00:54:37,043 --> 00:54:38,612
Screw that.

591
00:54:38,712 --> 00:54:40,681
- I'm getting Howie back.
- Howard!

592
00:54:40,781 --> 00:54:44,853
- Daddy, don't go!
- Tommy, don't! Don't, Tommy!

593
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:50,774
I'm starting to like you. I am.

594
00:54:51,424 --> 00:54:53,127
But this is my choice.

595
00:54:53,227 --> 00:54:57,713
Howard, what are you doing?
We've got four other kids here to protect.

596
00:54:57,813 --> 00:54:58,710
Howard.

597
00:54:58,810 --> 00:55:02,836
Baby, please don't do this. Listen,
we can figure something else out. Honey.

598
00:55:03,136 --> 00:55:07,408
- This is how I figure things out.
- Howard, you don't wanna do this.

599
00:55:07,508 --> 00:55:08,948
Howard.

600
00:55:09,048 --> 00:55:10,793
Howard.

601
00:55:15,681 --> 00:55:18,217
Howie!

602
00:55:22,721 --> 00:55:24,791
Howie.

603
00:55:28,845 --> 00:55:31,882
No, shut the door! Inside! Shut it!

604
00:55:41,006 --> 00:55:43,509
Don't open the door.

605
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:45,913
Dad?

606
00:55:46,663 --> 00:55:49,248
What are we gonna do now?

607
00:55:49,348 --> 00:55:52,218
We keep the fire hot.

608
00:56:21,747 --> 00:56:25,753
But what if you've
been good, like, all year?

609
00:56:25,853 --> 00:56:29,755
And you leave out milk and cookies
and do everything else right?

610
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,771
"It's not what you do.
It's what you believe.

611
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:48,608
And what you've given up... in here."

612
00:56:50,242 --> 00:56:52,879
But can't we make him go away?

613
00:56:58,885 --> 00:57:01,790
- What's she saying?
- I'm not sure.

614
00:57:01,899 --> 00:57:04,273
She says we're fucked.

615
00:57:06,792 --> 00:57:08,495
- How did you...
- 'cause I'm old enough to know

616
00:57:08,595 --> 00:57:12,098
when life is coming at you
with his pants down.

617
00:57:30,749 --> 00:57:32,319
Hey.

618
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,291
When they took Howie...

619
00:57:36,391 --> 00:57:38,942
what did you see up there?

620
00:57:40,726 --> 00:57:43,596
You believe that story, right?

621
00:57:44,963 --> 00:57:46,716
Do you?

622
00:57:46,816 --> 00:57:49,348
I don't know what I believe anymore.

623
00:57:49,448 --> 00:57:51,865
I know I'm going out there
to find Beth. I have to.

624
00:57:51,965 --> 00:57:54,576
- I don't even care if I die trying.
- I know. Listen.

625
00:57:54,676 --> 00:57:57,244
Let's get Howard and Linda.
I have an idea.

626
00:58:50,029 --> 00:58:52,032
Linda.

627
00:58:52,682 --> 00:58:54,544
Can we talk with you
and Howard for a minute?

628
00:58:54,644 --> 00:58:56,780
Can it wait?

629
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:00,773
I just wanna get these rewrapped
for the kids.

630
00:59:00,873 --> 00:59:02,542
It's important.

631
00:59:02,742 --> 00:59:05,206
- The snowplow?
- The keys were in the ignition,

632
00:59:05,306 --> 00:59:09,316
and it was beat to hell,
but if it runs, I drive it back here,

633
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:14,347
then everyone piles in the car and follows
while I clear a path in front of us.

634
00:59:14,587 --> 00:59:16,490
And go where?

635
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:18,959
The mall doubles as an emergency shelter.

636
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:21,765
And if it's empty,
we'll try the police station.

637
00:59:22,195 --> 00:59:23,964
And what if they're gone too?

638
00:59:24,064 --> 00:59:28,185
Then we keep driving
till we see lights or people,

639
00:59:28,285 --> 00:59:30,540
plowed road, somewhere safe for the kids.

640
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:34,508
And then we bring help back here.
For Beth and Howie.

641
00:59:34,608 --> 00:59:38,210
You're not thinking of going
for the plow by yourself, are you?

642
00:59:39,678 --> 00:59:43,182
Well, a shepherd's got
to protect his flock.

643
01:00:30,161 --> 01:00:32,632
I can't believe you're afraid
to come up here by yourself.

644
01:00:32,732 --> 01:00:36,335
It's not my fault Aunt Dorothy
clogged up the crapper.

645
01:00:37,469 --> 01:00:39,840
- Hey, Stevie?
- Yeah.

646
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,644
Do you think they took Howie
'cause of the time he painted the cats?

647
01:00:44,944 --> 01:00:47,413
I don't know, Jordan.

648
01:00:48,881 --> 01:00:52,272
- Do you think he's dead?
- I don't know.

649
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:56,422
Jordan?

650
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:59,748
Stevie?

651
01:01:02,594 --> 01:01:04,607
Beth?

652
01:01:04,707 --> 01:01:06,185
Beth, you up there?

653
01:01:06,285 --> 01:01:10,504
Stevie? Jordan? What are you doing?

654
01:01:10,604 --> 01:01:13,740
Where have you been?
Everyone's freaking out.

655
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:18,578
Come up here and I'll show you.
I've been waiting for you guys.

656
01:01:18,678 --> 01:01:20,579
Hurry.

657
01:01:21,246 --> 01:01:24,684
- Have you told Max yet?
- No. Not yet.

658
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:29,823
Jordan? Stevie!

659
01:01:32,191 --> 01:01:34,094
Where are they? Where did they go?

660
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:36,963
They were just here.
I think they went to the bathroom.

661
01:01:37,063 --> 01:01:40,866
- And you just let them go?
- Was there another option?

662
01:01:43,001 --> 01:01:44,671
Jordan! Stevie!

663
01:01:44,771 --> 01:01:46,973
- Linda.
- Jordan.

664
01:01:47,073 --> 01:01:48,943
Listen.

665
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:51,705
Honey, who is that?

666
01:01:51,805 --> 01:01:53,546
Howard, stay here.

667
01:01:58,517 --> 01:02:00,120
Omi.

668
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:03,255
I think all this might be my fault.

669
01:02:17,168 --> 01:02:19,416
Uncle Howard?

670
01:02:22,941 --> 01:02:24,793
Rosie.

671
01:02:25,343 --> 01:02:27,369
Come here, girl.

672
01:02:29,281 --> 01:02:31,251
Useless turd.

673
01:02:31,884 --> 01:02:34,953
All right, wait here.

674
01:02:50,502 --> 01:02:52,339
Jordan?

675
01:02:52,839 --> 01:02:54,808
Stevie?

676
01:03:14,793 --> 01:03:17,300
- Jordan.
- Stevie?

677
01:03:30,675 --> 01:03:32,978
You guys.

678
01:03:40,686 --> 01:03:43,055
What the hell is this?

679
01:03:49,317 --> 01:03:50,866
Goddamn it.

680
01:03:52,965 --> 01:03:55,968
It's okay. I got you.

681
01:03:56,068 --> 01:03:58,605
You're gonna be okay.

682
01:05:10,592 --> 01:05:12,328
Oh, come on.

683
01:05:16,015 --> 01:05:19,050
Oh, my God!

684
01:05:20,352 --> 01:05:23,054
Oh, my God!

685
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:31,164
Shoot it, Tom! Shoot it!
For God's sake, shoot it!

686
01:05:36,501 --> 01:05:38,036
Linda!

687
01:05:47,479 --> 01:05:49,215
We should have gone to my brother's.

688
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:07,967
- Where did it go? Oh, my God.
- I don't know!

689
01:06:42,234 --> 01:06:43,795
- Bear!
- What?

690
01:06:43,895 --> 01:06:45,822
Bear!

691
01:07:33,352 --> 01:07:36,153
Got to be kidding me!

692
01:07:45,397 --> 01:07:48,667
- Merry Christmas, mother...
- There he is! Charge!

693
01:08:08,955 --> 01:08:10,790
That's a good girl.

694
01:08:38,316 --> 01:08:41,953
Wha... Stevie? Stevie?

695
01:09:08,413 --> 01:09:12,538
Hey! Give me back my kids, you... fudger!

696
01:09:16,388 --> 01:09:17,990
Jordan!

697
01:09:19,557 --> 01:09:22,161
Stevie. I'm coming, baby.

698
01:09:22,561 --> 01:09:25,231
Stevie. Baby.

699
01:09:25,331 --> 01:09:29,102
It's okay. Mama's here.
Mama's here. There you go.

700
01:09:29,202 --> 01:09:33,556
Mom, it got Jordan.
It was gonna get me next.

701
01:09:36,641 --> 01:09:40,345
Thanks, honey. Are you okay?

702
01:09:54,092 --> 01:09:55,961
What?

703
01:09:56,594 --> 01:09:58,297
Mom!

704
01:09:58,497 --> 01:09:59,932
Max!

705
01:10:00,232 --> 01:10:03,552
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

706
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:05,638
- Max, are you okay?
- Yeah.

707
01:10:05,738 --> 01:10:08,141
- What happened up there?
- They got Jordan.

708
01:10:08,241 --> 01:10:09,810
Who?

709
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:17,681
Mom?

710
01:10:17,781 --> 01:10:20,153
I think it's panicking,
trying to get outside.

711
01:10:20,553 --> 01:10:23,089
Well, we boarded everything up.

712
01:10:23,389 --> 01:10:25,757
Howard, that's Jordan.

713
01:10:25,857 --> 01:10:28,394
We got to get in there.
We got to get in there and get her out.

714
01:10:28,494 --> 01:10:30,930
What are we dealing with?
What did you see up there?

715
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:32,899
You don't wanna know, sweetheart.

716
01:10:32,999 --> 01:10:37,036
Honey, I just got my ass kicked
by a bunch of Christmas cookies,

717
01:10:37,236 --> 01:10:40,139
so trust me when I say I can take it!

718
01:10:50,615 --> 01:10:53,663
No, no, no. Max, what are you doing?

719
01:10:55,103 --> 01:10:57,373
Go get 'em, girl.

720
01:11:04,995 --> 01:11:07,232
Get 'em, Rosie.

721
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:27,419
Rosie?

722
01:11:46,105 --> 01:11:48,859
For God's sake, Howard, shoot it!

723
01:11:52,477 --> 01:11:55,147
- Get it off me!
- Dad!

724
01:11:55,247 --> 01:11:58,249
- Howard!
- You bitch!

725
01:12:01,986 --> 01:12:04,356
Get it off me!

726
01:12:08,026 --> 01:12:10,065
Dad!

727
01:12:10,165 --> 01:12:11,996
Omi!

728
01:12:28,413 --> 01:12:31,350
Aunt Dorothy? Finish it.

729
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:33,636
With pleasure.

730
01:12:39,612 --> 01:12:40,706
<i>Elves.</i>

731
01:12:41,741 --> 01:12:43,078
Shit.

732
01:13:24,569 --> 01:13:26,372
- Howard, where's Chrissy?
- I don't know!

733
01:13:26,472 --> 01:13:30,042
Where's the baby?
Honey, where's your sister?

734
01:13:32,471 --> 01:13:34,580
No! No!

735
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,887
- No!
- Howard! Howard, the baby!

736
01:13:38,217 --> 01:13:41,285
I'll see you in hell.

737
01:13:42,788 --> 01:13:45,534
Twisted fairy-tale horseshit!

738
01:13:45,634 --> 01:13:47,899
Howard, no!

739
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,364
Great.

740
01:14:21,392 --> 01:14:24,417
Are you okay? Are you okay?

741
01:14:24,917 --> 01:14:27,432
Max, get the ammo.

742
01:14:30,151 --> 01:14:31,333
Where did they go?

743
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:34,383
I'm more worried about when they come back.
We need to make a break for it.

744
01:14:34,483 --> 01:14:37,810
- For what, Tom?
- The snowplow. It's our only shot.

745
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:40,445
And then we're going after 'em.

746
01:14:40,745 --> 01:14:44,050
What is going on? Sarah, what's going on?

747
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:47,740
- Mom, come on. We're leaving.
- You're gonna be okay.

748
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:53,391
Mom! We have to go. Now!

749
01:14:56,594 --> 01:14:58,463
It's him.

750
01:15:08,717 --> 01:15:10,390
Let's go.

751
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:14,212
Max. Max, come, come, come.

752
01:15:14,546 --> 01:15:17,582
Come on. Okay.

753
01:15:18,449 --> 01:15:21,220
- Hurry, hurry.
- Get your gloves on. Put your hood up.

754
01:15:24,955 --> 01:15:26,825
Ready?

755
01:15:31,029 --> 01:15:35,300
Everybody... hold on to each other.

756
01:15:44,491 --> 01:15:45,761
Omi!

757
01:15:46,811 --> 01:15:50,933
- Be good.
- Omi! Omi!

758
01:15:51,033 --> 01:15:53,435
Omi, no!

759
01:15:53,535 --> 01:15:55,554
Omi!

760
01:15:55,654 --> 01:15:57,175
Mom!

761
01:15:57,275 --> 01:16:00,617
Mom, open the door! Mom!

762
01:16:01,017 --> 01:16:04,296
Mom, you open this door now!

763
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:08,309
- The window.
- Dad!

764
01:16:08,409 --> 01:16:13,137
She wants to face him.
She's trying to help.

765
01:16:17,375 --> 01:16:20,788
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Go!

766
01:18:39,316 --> 01:18:41,352
Keep moving!

767
01:18:59,605 --> 01:19:02,808
Go! Go! Get behind me. Go.

768
01:19:03,108 --> 01:19:05,244
Go, go, go! Keep moving.

769
01:19:05,544 --> 01:19:07,679
Come on, buddy.

770
01:19:12,249 --> 01:19:13,919
Come on.

771
01:19:25,913 --> 01:19:27,916
You have to go. You have to go.

772
01:19:28,016 --> 01:19:29,368
- I need you to go.
- No.

773
01:19:29,568 --> 01:19:32,638
All of you, you have to go.
Do you understand?

774
01:19:32,738 --> 01:19:35,407
Keep driving. Do you understand?

775
01:19:38,426 --> 01:19:41,563
I love you. I love you, buddy.

776
01:19:43,047 --> 01:19:45,751
Go! Now! Go!

777
01:19:48,485 --> 01:19:50,521
Go!

778
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:58,796
Come on!

779
01:20:20,818 --> 01:20:22,854
Come on.

780
01:20:26,457 --> 01:20:30,629
Keep going. Keep going. God. Get in.
I want you to get up in there.

781
01:20:30,729 --> 01:20:34,432
I want you to get in there.
You stay here. You don't move.

782
01:20:36,168 --> 01:20:39,838
- Okay? You understand?
- Mom! Mom, please!

783
01:20:40,138 --> 01:20:44,009
Sarah! Baby, go with your Aunt Sarah.

784
01:20:45,442 --> 01:20:49,448
Stevie, sweetheart, it's okay.
It's okay. Come on.

785
01:20:49,948 --> 01:20:51,649
Sarah!

786
01:20:51,749 --> 01:20:54,152
Stay here. I'll be right back.

787
01:20:54,529 --> 01:20:56,555
Sarah!

788
01:20:57,505 --> 01:20:59,291
Mom! No!

789
01:20:59,391 --> 01:21:01,827
- Mom! Mom!
- I love you.

790
01:21:01,927 --> 01:21:03,928
Mom!

791
01:21:08,933 --> 01:21:14,344
Max, we got to go. Max, we got to go. Max.

792
01:21:14,922 --> 01:21:16,892
Come on.

793
01:21:18,996 --> 01:21:23,006
It's not starting. It's not starting.
Why isn't it starting? Come on.

794
01:21:23,106 --> 01:21:24,653
- Come on, Max, please.
- I'm trying.

795
01:21:24,983 --> 01:21:28,186
I don't even know how to drive a stick.
We have a hybrid!

796
01:21:28,286 --> 01:21:31,022
Come on! Please!

797
01:22:08,359 --> 01:22:11,905
Max! Max! No! No...

798
01:22:13,798 --> 01:22:16,000
Stevie!

799
01:23:01,012 --> 01:23:05,384
<i>He left me as a reminder of what happens</i>

800
01:23:05,484 --> 01:23:08,621
<i>when hope is lost...</i>

801
01:23:09,321 --> 01:23:12,591
<i>when belief is forgotten...</i>

802
01:23:13,091 --> 01:23:17,362
<i>and the Christmas spirit dies.</i>

803
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:36,181
Help! Help! Help!

804
01:23:36,281 --> 01:23:38,316
Help me!

805
01:23:42,753 --> 01:23:44,789
Max!

806
01:23:55,716 --> 01:23:57,268
Help me!

807
01:24:02,306 --> 01:24:05,709
Hey! Asshole!

808
01:24:17,955 --> 01:24:20,525
I take back my wish!

809
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:23,094
I take it all back!

810
01:24:26,931 --> 01:24:29,913
Give me back my family!

811
01:25:27,573 --> 01:25:28,809
Max!

812
01:25:31,096 --> 01:25:32,798
Let her go!

813
01:25:33,998 --> 01:25:36,267
Help me!

814
01:25:55,403 --> 01:25:57,254
Please.

815
01:25:57,354 --> 01:25:59,457
I know you can fix this.

816
01:25:59,557 --> 01:26:01,776
Give them back.

817
01:26:03,527 --> 01:26:04,940
Take me instead.

818
01:26:42,633 --> 01:26:45,202
What are you doing? I said, take me.

819
01:26:45,469 --> 01:26:50,363
Take me. What are you doing? Take me! No!

820
01:26:50,775 --> 01:26:52,604
Stevie!

821
01:26:58,515 --> 01:27:00,719
No! Let me go!

822
01:27:01,986 --> 01:27:04,840
No! No! Please!

823
01:27:12,496 --> 01:27:14,299
I'm sorry.

824
01:27:15,532 --> 01:27:18,056
I just wanted Christmas
to be like it used to be.

825
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:24,790
No!

826
01:28:40,234 --> 01:28:42,270
You want down?

827
01:28:44,656 --> 01:28:47,425
This dog didn't keep you guys up?
She likes to bark at night.

828
01:28:47,525 --> 01:28:49,201
She sure does.

829
01:28:49,301 --> 01:28:51,862
Thanks for making pancakes.

830
01:28:57,834 --> 01:29:00,605
About time you got up.
We've been waiting forever.

831
01:29:00,705 --> 01:29:02,574
Oh, hey, there he is. Hey, kiddo.

832
01:29:02,674 --> 01:29:05,609
We thought the sugarplum fairies
may have gotten you.

833
01:29:05,709 --> 01:29:08,982
- You're all alive.
- Barely.

834
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:12,851
I haven't felt this hungover
since the pope died.

835
01:29:12,951 --> 01:29:14,846
What's up, buddy? Are you okay?

836
01:29:14,946 --> 01:29:17,224
Yeah, I just...

837
01:29:18,539 --> 01:29:22,355
Just had a bad dream, I guess.

838
01:29:23,962 --> 01:29:26,565
Enough with the sappy crap.
Let's open up the damn presents.

839
01:29:26,665 --> 01:29:31,248
Okay. Okay, already. Come on, Linda.
Let's do this. You're gonna help me?

840
01:29:32,252 --> 01:29:34,189
Okay.

841
01:29:34,439 --> 01:29:38,008
Merry Christmas, Max.

842
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:46,490
- Stevie, sweetheart.
- Thanks, Mom.

843
01:29:52,013 --> 01:29:53,891
Isn't that fun?

844
01:29:53,991 --> 01:29:57,327
- Hey, Maxi-pad.
- Training batting gloves.

845
01:29:57,528 --> 01:29:59,568
What could that possibly be?

846
01:29:59,668 --> 01:30:02,801
- Oh, my God!
- "Oh, my God" is right.

847
01:30:02,901 --> 01:30:05,871
That's from me and the girls.
I had to reattach the foot.

848
01:30:05,971 --> 01:30:08,442
But, yeah, if you look closely...

849
01:30:08,542 --> 01:30:11,556
he did a really good job
of reattaching it.

850
01:30:15,112 --> 01:30:18,516
- Oh, thank you.
- This is great.

851
01:30:19,016 --> 01:30:21,470
Omi, that's beautiful.

852
01:30:21,570 --> 01:30:26,071
- What's this all about?
- It's nothing. Just...

853
01:30:26,491 --> 01:30:28,359
Merry Christmas.

854
01:30:28,459 --> 01:30:32,434
- Well, merry Christmas to you too, Max.
- Merry Christmas, son.

855
01:31:00,057 --> 01:31:03,228
<i>I just wanted Christmas
to be like it used to be.</i>

856
01:31:03,328 --> 01:31:07,270
- <i>That's what a family is, Max.</i>
- <i>Nothing bad's gonna happen on Christmas.</i>

857
01:31:07,370 --> 01:31:10,652
<i>I just got my ass kicked
by a bunch of Christmas cookies,</i>

858
01:31:10,752 --> 01:31:14,340
- <i>so trust me when I say I can take it!</i>
- <i>...some people shouldn't be allowed to breed!"</i>

859
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:18,026
<i>Do you think they took Howie
'cause of the time he painted the cats?</i>

860
01:31:20,511 --> 01:31:24,250
<i>And as he had for thousands of years,</i>

861
01:31:24,749 --> 01:31:28,982
<i>Krampus came not to reward, but to punish.</i>

862
01:31:29,122 --> 01:31:31,438
<i>Not to give,</i>

863
01:31:31,538 --> 01:31:34,458
<i>but to take.</i>
