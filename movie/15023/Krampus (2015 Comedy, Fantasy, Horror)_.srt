00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,705
Thank you.

2
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,205
Have you finished the letter?

3
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,602
I'm sure you will think of something.

4
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,896
Naturally.

5
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:46,493
But... I also believe St. Nicholas is what
you make of him.

6
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:55,536
That to believe in him is
to believe in the true spirit of the holiday.

7
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:59,344
The spirit of giving. Of sacrifice...

8
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:12,178
I also believe in dessert before dinner.

9
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,240
Keep the fire hot.

10
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:40,650
Elves.
