He told me.
But it wasn't murder.

He isn't a ghost.
You'd better tell her.

945
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:28,800
- Why did you come here?
- Why not?

946
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:33,596
The man saved your life.
Aren't you going to thank him?

947
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:36,266
He'll kill you , Stephen!

948
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,685
He's the one who tried
to kill us with that bomb.

949
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:41,271
He gives the orders,
not Dr. Forrester.

[ Clicking Tongue ]

951
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,358
There wasn't much else to do.

952
01:21:45,484 --> 01:21:48,486
You were both finding out too much ,
and you wouldn't stop.

953
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:50,655
It was too good
a charity to lose.

954
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:53,032
And you'd kill
your sister to save it?

955
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:55,076
You killed your wife.

956
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:59,914
People do such things
under the strain of necessity.

957
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,958
We've always been very close.

958
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:04,669
I was really happy
when I found her alive.

959
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:08,548
Put your hat and coat on .
We're leaving.

Vorwärts!

961
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:21,686
The trouble with me is
I like people too much .

962
01:22:21,812 --> 01:22:23,813
I liked you at first.

963
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,274
That's why I tried
to frighten you out of London .

964
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,276
I was quite happy
letting you hit me on the jaw.

965
01:22:28,402 --> 01:22:30,194
I'm fond of that memory myself.

966
01:22:30,321 --> 01:22:33,281
But you're
a persistent man, Neale.

967
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:36,784
If I had known that you were
going to keep on messing about. . .

you would have never left
Mrs. Bellane's alive.

Are you ready, Carla?

01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:46,502
- Yes.
- It's a pity, Neale.

971
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:48,880
You could have led
a very peaceful life.

972

The films are sewed up
in that suit, aren't they?

973
01:22:52,259 --> 01:22:54,802
Oh , yes. Cost said
the shoulders would settle.

974

Killing me won't get you

I've always dreamed
