1
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,440
Neale?

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,401
Oh, there you are.
Come in.

3
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:43,601
You know,
it’s interesting to watch the last minute crawl by,

4
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:45,522
after so many of them.

5
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,882
I’ve always meant to have
that thing speeded up.

6
00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:52,803
It’s a fine time to think of it.

7
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:10,165
Free man.

8
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:14,766
You’re not wasting any time.
Not if I can help it.

9
00:02:14,806 --> 00:02:17,686
Where do you plan to go?

10
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:18,966
London.

11
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,487
It’s being heavily bombed
these nights.

12
00:02:21,487 --> 00:02:25,807
Don’t you think some quiet town
at first and get employment there for a while?

13
00:02:25,807 --> 00:02:28,888
I’m gonna spend
the first month being pushed and jammed...

14
00:02:28,888 --> 00:02:31,248
by the biggest crowds
I can find.

15
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:33,569
I want to hear
people talk and laugh.

16
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:37,449
After that clock,
seeing faces will be a good tonic.

17
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:41,450
I don’t blame you.
I’ll walk to the gate with you.

18
00:02:59,772 --> 00:03:01,573
One parting thought,

19
00:03:01,573 --> 00:03:04,413
Don’t get involved with
the police again in any way.

20
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:08,574
A second charge wouldn’t be easy.
A quiet life from here on.

21
00:03:08,574 --> 00:03:11,894
Well, good-bye
and good luck.

22
00:03:11,894 --> 00:03:13,214
Thank you.

23
00:03:40,498 --> 00:03:44,099
Good evening to ya.
Evening. Ticket to London, please.

24
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,179
Yes, sir,
in the wink of an eye.

25
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,741
What’s happening
over there?

26
00:03:57,741 --> 00:04:02,061
That’s our charity fete.
The ladies are doing themselves proud tonight.

27
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:06,622
Have a look and spend
a shilling or two. It’s well worth it.

28
00:04:07,302 --> 00:04:08,782
May I leave my things?
Certainly.

29
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:12,943
Put ‘em there on the bench. I’ll keep me eye on ‘em.
Thank you.

30
00:04:16,783 --> 00:04:18,584
Good evening.
Evening.

31
00:04:18,584 --> 00:04:19,824
Will you join our party?
Yes.

32
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:23,664
The charge is a shilling.
Doesn’t seem quite fair, though. It’s so late.

33
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:26,225
Wait five minutes.
Go in at the reduced price.

34
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:29,025
It’s all right.
I think it’s fair to warn people.

35
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:32,306
We don’t want them
to feel cheated, even in a good cause.

36
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,306
No.
What is the cause?

37
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:37,906
Mothers of
the free nations.

38
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:40,467
Catch it!

39
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:42,387
Thank you.

40
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:53,909
Come now, children.
Come along. It’s getting towards blackout time.

41
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:56,989
Now we’ll have
the treasure hunt. Get your spades and dig.

42
00:04:56,989 --> 00:05:00,790
Mind the vicar’s petunias.
Now run along. Run on.

43
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,951
Young gentleman,

44
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:10,511
won’t you buy a ticket
and guess its weight?

45
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:13,992
It’s a shilling.
Whoever is closest wins it.

46
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:17,512
All right.
Oh, thank you.

47
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:27,754
Oh, three pounds,
five ounces.

48
00:05:27,754 --> 00:05:31,634
A very good guess, I should say.

49
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:38,355
Your wife must’ve been teaching you.
I have no wife.

50
00:05:38,355 --> 00:05:42,276
Now you must try
the fortune-tellers. You really must.

51
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:44,356
Mrs. Bellane is wonderful.

52
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:45,396
She told my son...

53
00:05:45,396 --> 00:05:49,357
I was just telling
this gentleman about Mrs. Bellane and my son.

54
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:51,517
Uh...
oh, I’ll see her.

55
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,837
Oh, thanks.
How nice.

56
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:57,318
Isn’t he
a lovely gentleman?

57
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:10,000
Sit down...

58
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,600
and cross my palm
with silver.

59
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:25,122
Your hand.

60
00:06:27,642 --> 00:06:30,963
You’re up-to-date here.
Electric light.

61
00:06:30,963 --> 00:06:35,443
First the character,
then the past. By law, I’m not allowed to tell the future.

62
00:06:38,804 --> 00:06:42,844
Aha. You have found true
contentment in a happy marriage.

63
00:06:43,764 --> 00:06:46,765
I’m not married.
Then you will be. Heaven help the woman.

64
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:50,886
Aw, don’t be angry, please.
I haven’t had as much pleasure in two years.

65
00:06:50,886 --> 00:06:54,806
I mean it.
Really? Then let’s get on with it.

66
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:57,646
Now the past.

67
00:06:57,646 --> 00:07:01,127
This line that runs here...

68
00:07:01,127 --> 00:07:03,767
you have made
one woman happy.

69
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:07,168
Is something wrong?

70
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:11,368
No. Nothing.

71
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:15,129
Forget the past.
Just tell me the future.

72
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:20,530
What you want is the cake.

73
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,170
You must give the weight...

74
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,851
as 4 pounds,
15-and-a-half ounces.

75
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:31,571
Is it the right weight?
That’s immaterial.

76
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:34,412
Don’t I hear any more fortune?
No.

77
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,012
You can go now.

78
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:38,332
Thank you.

79
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:42,893
I’ll try it.

80
00:07:57,255 --> 00:08:00,536
I would like to buy another chance.
Bravo!

81
00:08:00,536 --> 00:08:02,216
That’s a splendid idea.

82
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:06,056
Splendid!

83
00:08:07,016 --> 00:08:10,777
I would say 4 pounds,
15-and-a-half ounces.

84
00:08:12,497 --> 00:08:16,378
Lawks! Anybody could tell
you’re a bachelor.

85
00:08:17,058 --> 00:08:19,498
As a matter of fact,
the gentleman has won it.

86
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:22,739
He’s not more than
a fraction of an ounce out.

87
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:25,819
You’d better not
eat too much.

88
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:27,659
It’ll be
heavy as lead.

89
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:31,500
On the contrary,
it’s made with real eggs.

90
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,220
There you are.

91
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,661
Thank you.
Thank you.

92
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:25,948
Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!

93
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:28,628
Oh, the gentleman with the cake,
please, wait.

94
00:09:28,628 --> 00:09:30,868
I’ve made a mistake
about the weight.

95
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:33,429
I’m so sorry,
but it wasn’t what you said.

96
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:37,309
The real weight is
three pounds and two ounces.

97
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:40,310
The other gentleman won it.
What gentleman?

98
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,310
There with Mrs. Bellane.

99
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,430
What did he guess?

100
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,351
Oh, much closer. Three pounds and eight ounces.

101
00:09:48,351 --> 00:09:52,752
In that case, I still win.
My first guess was three pounds and five ounces.

102
00:09:56,432 --> 00:10:00,753
Give the gentleman this shilling
and tell him you’re sorry. Good night.

103
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:06,234
You don’t find many
good cakes these days.

104
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:09,114
I told you
it’d be worthwhile.

105
00:10:09,114 --> 00:10:12,314
Here’s an empty one where
you can stretch out and sleep.

106
00:10:12,314 --> 00:10:15,955
There’s no readin’
with those dim-out lights. Keep the curtains drawn.

107
00:10:15,955 --> 00:10:19,996
All right.
The Nazis’ll be over in a bit. The red alert went up.

108
00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:23,156
I hope our lads give ‘em
a proper pastin’.

109
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,316
Well, good night, sir.
Good night. Thank you.

110
00:10:25,316 --> 00:10:29,157
Hope they don’t bomb the railway.
I hope.

111
00:11:05,562 --> 00:11:09,243
Is there space here
for one more?

112
00:11:09,963 --> 00:11:13,643
It’s empty except for me.
Come in.

113
00:11:13,963 --> 00:11:17,844
Here. That’s right.

114
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,124
Thanks.

115
00:11:19,564 --> 00:11:21,164
You are very kind.

116
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:24,845
Not at all.
Good to have company.

117
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:35,846
Going through to London?

118
00:11:35,846 --> 00:11:39,407
Yes. They say
the red’s up.

119
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,567
So I was told.

120
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:45,488
Seems strange to hear people
tell of the blackout.

121
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:49,208
I guess I’m better off
than most...

122
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,969
at getting about
in the dark.

123
00:11:50,969 --> 00:11:54,049
I haven’t been out much
at night myself.

124
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:57,290
I hear the bombers
overhead every night.

125
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,930
They pass over my farm
on their way to London.

126
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,571
It’s a dread sound.
Yes, it is.

127
00:12:09,171 --> 00:12:12,172
Would you like some cake?
Cake?

128
00:12:12,172 --> 00:12:14,292
Yes. I won it
at the fete.

129
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:18,253
Share it with me.
It’s a long way to a London restaurant.

130
00:12:18,293 --> 00:12:21,973
Well, if you’re
going to have some.

131
00:12:37,295 --> 00:12:40,616
Here you are.

132
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,457
Feel how light it is.

133
00:12:46,457 --> 00:12:47,377
Made with eggs.

134
00:12:47,377 --> 00:12:51,697
You’d think it was made
with gold, the way they wanted to hang onto it.

135
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:33,583
I hear them now.

136
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,944
What?
The Nazis.

137
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:48,946
They must be trying
for the black moor factory.

138
00:14:02,788 --> 00:14:06,668
There are some low buildings about a mile.
That’s it.

139
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,388
It’s a munitions plant.

140
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:24,216
Excuse me. There didn’t seem
to be anyone here.

141
00:17:26,897 --> 00:17:29,737
- What do you want?
- I’m looking for Mr. Rennit.

142
00:17:29,737 --> 00:17:32,898
I’m Mr. Rennit. You should
have made an appointment.

143
00:17:32,898 --> 00:17:36,298
Evidently, you don’t
want clients. Good morning.

144
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:39,699
Now, now, now, you don’t
want to lose your temper.

145
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:43,219
I’m a busy man. There are
ways of doing things.

146
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:45,900
Take a chair, and
we’ll both have a drink.

147
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,940
Not a bad idea.
It’s an excellent idea.

148
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,620
These raids are bad
for the nerves.

149
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,661
One must have
a little something. One gets rattled.

150
00:17:56,501 --> 00:18:00,022
You’ll excuse
a teacup?

151
00:18:06,623 --> 00:18:10,063
I’ve never objected
to stimulants...

152
00:18:10,063 --> 00:18:12,823
as stimulants.

153
00:18:12,823 --> 00:18:16,384
Your health.
I may need it.

154
00:18:19,344 --> 00:18:23,065
Now... to business.

155
00:18:27,986 --> 00:18:31,506
Your name?
Stephen Neale.

156
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:36,147
Have you a pencil?

157
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:37,427
Thank you.

158
00:18:38,387 --> 00:18:40,107
How did you happen
to come to me?

159
00:18:40,107 --> 00:18:43,548
I don’t like my hotel room
being ransacked when I’m out.

160
00:18:43,548 --> 00:18:46,668
I don’t like being robbed
on trains or shot at.

161
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:50,789
Mr. Neale, this is
a respectable business with a tradition.

162
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:53,389
I’m not Sherlock Holmes.

163
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:56,510
A man in my position doesn’t
go crawling about floors...

164
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,990
with a... with a microscope
looking for bloodstains.

165
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,711
If you’re
in that kind of trouble, you should go to the police.

166
00:19:02,711 --> 00:19:05,111
I don’t wish to be mixed up
with the police. Sorry.

167
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:09,272
It would have been worth 20 to have you come with me.
Twenty pounds?

168
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:11,992
Well, let’s get on with it.
I see.

169
00:19:11,992 --> 00:19:16,073
War plays the devil with a business like this.
Come on.

170
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,395
You come in
if there’s trouble.

171
00:19:43,236 --> 00:19:44,477
Yes?

172
00:19:47,237 --> 00:19:50,838
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.

173
00:19:50,838 --> 00:19:53,958
I’m looking for the address
of a Mrs. Bellane.

174
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,878
No lady of that name
works here.

175
00:19:55,878 --> 00:19:58,679
She was helping with
your charity fete at Lembridge.

176
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,479
Oh, they were voluntary helpers.
I’m sorry.

177
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,720
We can’t
possibly disclose...

178
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,960
the addresses
of the voluntary helpers.

179
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
Well, isn’t there
some way I can get it?

180
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,721
You see, a mistake was made.
She gave me a cake that didn’t belong to me.

181
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:15,721
Well, it’s
against the rules,

182
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:19,322
But I’ll inquire.

183
00:20:45,765 --> 00:20:49,366
Will you come through,
please?

184
00:20:50,406 --> 00:20:53,807
Come in, won’t you?

185
00:20:57,327 --> 00:21:01,168
I’m terribly sorry, but I couldn’t help it.

186
00:21:01,168 --> 00:21:04,888
People have baked
some sad-looking pastries to sell at our fetes,

187
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,528
but was it frightful?

188
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:10,889
Frightful?
That you’d come all the way from Lembridge to give it back.

189
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:14,930
He hasn’t
any cake with him.

190
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,290
Have a chair.

191
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,491
You know, my sister has
a grim sense of humor.

192
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:26,291
If it’d been any good,
he’d have eaten it.

193
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:30,812
May I ask your name?
Stephen Neale.

194
00:21:30,812 --> 00:21:34,812
I’m Willi Hilfe. Carla, Mr. Neale.
How do you do?

195
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:38,733
Who was it you wanted?
A Mrs. Bellane.

196
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:41,253
Bellane? Bellane.

197
00:21:41,253 --> 00:21:44,574
I don’t remember
any name like that. We have so many of them.

198
00:21:44,574 --> 00:21:48,134
Uh, do you know her?
No. Look in the index.

199
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:52,175
Well, we’re not
supposed to give... why do you want it?

200
00:21:52,655 --> 00:21:56,536
We got along famously.
I’d like to see her next time I’m down.

201
00:21:56,536 --> 00:22:00,416
Find out how the mix-up happened.
Oh, I see.

202
00:22:04,297 --> 00:22:07,177
You got along famously?
Yes.

203
00:22:07,177 --> 00:22:10,898
- Didn’t her husband object?
- Has she a husband?

204
00:22:10,898 --> 00:22:14,418
“Mrs.”

205
00:22:14,618 --> 00:22:18,539
- Yes, it does, doesn’t it?
- Bell. Belden.

206
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:20,899
Bellane.

207
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,700
Here she is.
Mrs. Rolf Bellane.

208
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,740
A clairvoyant. Is that the one?
Yes.

209
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,700
She lives here in London.
209 Campden lane.

210
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,221
Canon topping
recommended her.

211
00:22:32,221 --> 00:22:35,741
Here you are.
Thank you.

212
00:22:39,382 --> 00:22:43,662
Could any of your volunteers
be using this organization as a shield?

213
00:22:44,783 --> 00:22:47,383
For what?
Some kind of crime.

214
00:22:47,383 --> 00:22:50,343
Our dear old dowagers?
Oh, no!

215
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,545
He tried
to kill you?

216
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,585
There’s just
one bullet left.

217
00:23:01,585 --> 00:23:03,785
He’d have used that
if the bomb hadn’t got him.

218
00:23:03,785 --> 00:23:07,346
But it... it’s fantastic,
the whole thing.

219
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:11,146
I’d like to investigate
this Mrs. Bellane with you, Neale.

220
00:23:11,146 --> 00:23:14,147
I’d like to have you.
Oh, no, Willi, please.

221
00:23:14,147 --> 00:23:18,347
If they tried to kill
Mr. Neale, something might happen to you.

222
00:23:18,867 --> 00:23:23,148
Nonsense.
If they use our charity fetes, I want to find out about it.

223
00:23:23,588 --> 00:23:25,908
She may be right, Mr. Hilfe.
Ah.

224
00:23:25,908 --> 00:23:30,189
She’s just tired
of getting me out of scrapes. Got me out of Austria.

225
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:34,950
Grow some gray hairs, Afferl.
You’ll be stunning.

226
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,870
Come on, Neale.

227
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,231
Good-bye.
Bye.

228
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,913
What do you want?

229
00:23:55,913 --> 00:23:58,513
Is this Mr. Finney?
No.

230
00:23:58,513 --> 00:24:01,954
No? I didn’t think so.

231
00:24:27,997 --> 00:24:30,838
Is Mrs. Bellane home?
Who is calling, please?

232
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:34,678
Mr. Hilfe, secretary of
the mothers of the free nations.

233
00:24:34,678 --> 00:24:38,039
Will you come in?

234
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,721
Will you please
wait a moment?

235
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:16,644
Oh, I see.
She’s not the one.

236
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:21,485
Mr. Hilfe?
I’m Mr. Hilfe.

237
00:25:21,525 --> 00:25:24,926
Mrs...
Bellane. I’ve heard many of the ladies speak of you.

238
00:25:24,926 --> 00:25:27,766
I should have paid a call
at your office long ago.

239
00:25:27,766 --> 00:25:29,766
I would have enjoyed it.

240
00:25:29,766 --> 00:25:32,607
May I present
Mr. Neale?

241
00:25:32,607 --> 00:25:35,127
Mr. Neale,
are you one of our group?

242
00:25:35,127 --> 00:25:36,847
By adoption, yes.

243
00:25:36,847 --> 00:25:40,488
Mrs. Bellane?

244
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:45,088
Oh, I beg your pardon.
We’ll start at once, doctor.

245
00:25:45,088 --> 00:25:49,569
I have a group waiting for
a séance. Won’t you join us? We can talk afterwards.

246
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:52,530
Yes, we’d like to.

247
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:56,090
Splendid. I want to tell you
about our fete at Lembridge.

248
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,170
We took in
a hundred pounds.

249
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:01,571
Oh, were you there?

250
00:26:01,931 --> 00:26:05,331
Yes. I told fortunes.

251
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:21,254
I’m so sorry
to keep you waiting.

252
00:26:21,254 --> 00:26:22,694
You especially,
Mr. Newby.

253
00:26:22,694 --> 00:26:26,734
I know you have to catch the early train.
Not at all.

254
00:26:27,695 --> 00:26:31,535
- Can you make room for
Mr. Hilfe over there, doctor? - Certainly.

255
00:26:31,535 --> 00:26:34,936
This is Dr. Forrester.

256
00:26:35,496 --> 00:26:38,736
Mr. Hilfe?

257
00:26:40,616 --> 00:26:43,097
And you, Mr. Neale,

258
00:26:43,097 --> 00:26:44,657
over there.

259
00:26:44,657 --> 00:26:47,777
- Mr. Newby.
- How do you do?

260
00:26:47,777 --> 00:26:49,098
Miss Penteel.

261
00:26:49,098 --> 00:26:53,098
She has extraordinary powers
of painting the inner world.

262
00:26:53,298 --> 00:26:56,899
Colored,
rhythmic arrangements.

263
00:26:57,139 --> 00:27:00,859
Will you please
form the circle?

264
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,381
Now if you will
all join hands...

265
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:14,901
before the lights fade.

266
00:27:18,062 --> 00:27:21,622
We mustn’t
break the circle.

267
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:27,543
The lights Wili...

268
00:27:30,384 --> 00:27:33,144
Oh, Mr. Cost,
I didn’t think you were coming.

269
00:27:33,144 --> 00:27:36,945
Always those customers
at the last moment. May I?

270
00:27:36,945 --> 00:27:40,945
May I present
our newcomers? Mr. Neale, Mr. Cost.

271
00:27:41,265 --> 00:27:44,226
- How do you do?
- It seems we’ve met before.

272
00:27:44,226 --> 00:27:46,306
I’m sorry.
I don’t believe I recall it.

273
00:27:46,306 --> 00:27:50,707
This is Mr. Hilfe, secretary of the mothers of the free nations.

274
00:27:50,827 --> 00:27:54,507
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

275
00:27:56,227 --> 00:27:59,748
The lights
will fade now.

276
00:29:10,158 --> 00:29:11,438
Yes?

277
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:13,998
Yes?

278
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:19,559
I can’t hear you.

279
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,481
One of you won’t...

280
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:33,881
let her come through.

281
00:29:34,241 --> 00:29:38,002
Someone whose motives
are evil.

282
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:46,363
You can speak.

283
00:29:46,563 --> 00:29:49,964
There’s no enemy here.

284
00:29:50,964 --> 00:29:53,844
I had to find you.

285
00:29:53,844 --> 00:29:56,005
I watched it too, Stephen.

286
00:29:56,005 --> 00:29:59,805
Stephen, you sat there
watching the clock.

287
00:30:00,725 --> 00:30:02,005
I know.

288
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:05,006
You waited for me to die.

289
00:30:05,006 --> 00:30:07,686
Was the poison
strong enough?

290
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:09,606
The clock stood still.

291
00:30:09,606 --> 00:30:12,727
You killed me.
The poison.

292
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:16,007
The clock stood still.
You murdered!

293
00:30:16,007 --> 00:30:17,928
Who speaks?
Who said that?

294
00:30:17,928 --> 00:30:21,088
Don’t break the circle!
Who told you that?

295
00:30:22,648 --> 00:30:26,609
turn on the lights!
Turn on the lights!

296
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:33,050
Cost. Look at cost!

297
00:30:38,091 --> 00:30:41,611
What... happened,
doctor?

298
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:47,572
Look after her,
will you?

299
00:31:00,654 --> 00:31:02,734
A doctor’s no good,
I’m afraid.

300
00:31:02,734 --> 00:31:05,294
There’s only one thing
Call the police.

301
00:31:05,294 --> 00:31:09,375
He did it.
He broke the circle. All our hands were locked.

302
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:12,175
I didn’t kill him.

303
00:31:12,175 --> 00:31:14,296
You have that revolver.
I didn’t fire it.

304
00:31:14,296 --> 00:31:18,296
There was
only one bullet left. It’s still there.

305
00:31:24,457 --> 00:31:27,138
You hold him here, Mr. Hilfe.
I’ll ring up the police.

306
00:31:27,138 --> 00:31:30,418
I will not
be drawn into this. I have to catch my train.

307
00:31:30,418 --> 00:31:33,899
Stay, newbie. The police will want all of us.

308
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:36,819
Well, I’ll not wait
in here with him!

309
00:31:36,819 --> 00:31:40,379
Then go
into the library.

310
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,460
Wait for me,
Mr. Newby!

311
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:53,261
Believe me, Hilfe.
I’ve only your word for it that there was one bullet.

312
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:56,582
It’s the truth.
I’m done if the police arrest me again.

313
00:31:56,582 --> 00:32:00,782
Someone here knows it... knows all about me.
But why would they kill him?

314
00:32:00,782 --> 00:32:04,943
I don’t know. He’s the one that
came to Lembridge for the cake.

315
00:32:05,983 --> 00:32:07,303
Oh, I see.

316
00:32:09,104 --> 00:32:13,344
Give me a chance
to find out. I’ll never clear myself behind bars.

317
00:32:14,864 --> 00:32:16,985
I’d like to, Neale,

318
00:32:16,985 --> 00:32:20,825
but I’d be in trouble myself
if I let you go.

319
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,386
I’m an alien.

320
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:27,346
You know what?

321
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:31,347
You might knock me out.
Go ahead. It’s a good alibi.

322
00:32:31,587 --> 00:32:33,427
But get away
from London.

323
00:32:33,427 --> 00:32:37,348
Well, I’ve never said
“thank you” this way before.

324
00:35:23,852 --> 00:35:26,212
Mothers
of the free nations.

325
00:35:26,212 --> 00:35:28,492
Mr. Neale?
This is Carla Hilfe.

326
00:35:28,492 --> 00:35:32,693
- Is your brother there?
- No. There’s a fete at Bloomsbury.

327
00:35:32,693 --> 00:35:36,493
He wanted to see
if there was anything...

328
00:35:36,613 --> 00:35:37,614
anything like Lembridge.

329
00:35:37,614 --> 00:35:42,214
- He told you what happened?
- Yes. He said the police didn’t hold any of the others.

330
00:35:42,734 --> 00:35:46,735
- They’re searching for you.
- I can imagine.

331
00:35:46,735 --> 00:35:49,055
- Where will you hide?
- I don’t know yet.

332
00:35:49,055 --> 00:35:53,416
I thought I had a place,
but it seems my unknown friends got there first.

333
00:35:53,536 --> 00:35:56,176
Where are you now?

334
00:35:56,176 --> 00:35:58,737
Longacre and bend?

335
00:35:58,737 --> 00:36:02,097
Wait there for me.

336
00:36:44,863 --> 00:36:48,224
I was afraid you’d be gone. The air raid.
I would have waited.

337
00:36:48,224 --> 00:36:50,904
I know a place.
We can’t get through now.

338
00:36:50,904 --> 00:36:54,705
A girl I helped
out of Austria hid there until I got her papers.

339
00:36:54,705 --> 00:36:59,065
Down to the tube, please.
We expect them at any moment. This way, please.

340
00:37:15,868 --> 00:37:19,388
It’s hot, isn’t it?
Yes.

341
00:37:21,749 --> 00:37:24,269
Carla?
What?

342
00:37:24,269 --> 00:37:28,630
I wonder if you realize
what it means to stand all alone on a dark corner,

343
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:34,030
knowing that somewhere
one person is coming towards you to help.

344
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,071
Yes.

345
00:37:38,511 --> 00:37:42,632
It was that way
the first night I stepped off the boat...

346
00:37:42,992 --> 00:37:44,872
in England.

347
00:37:44,872 --> 00:37:45,752
It changed things.

348
00:37:45,752 --> 00:37:50,153
I thought at first
I could let you help without telling you the truth, but...

349
00:37:54,753 --> 00:37:57,634
you didn’t kill him?

350
00:37:57,634 --> 00:37:59,914
No. Not cost.

351
00:37:59,914 --> 00:38:03,955
I was sentenced here in London
two years ago... for murder.

352
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:06,355
What the voice said
at the séance?

353
00:38:06,355 --> 00:38:09,955
Your brother told you?
Yes.

354
00:38:11,276 --> 00:38:11,916
Murderer.

355
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:16,396
Perhaps I was, if thinking
of the thing for months before you do it makes you one.

356
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:21,597
Lying awake every night,
thinking of it...

357
00:38:22,237 --> 00:38:25,838
until at last
you go out and buy the drug.

358
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:29,398
I bought it
to kill my wife.

359
00:38:30,198 --> 00:38:32,679
She’d been ill for more than
a year, slowly wasting away.

360
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:37,039
She couldn’t stand the pain
any longer, and the doctors couldn’t help her.

361
00:38:37,279 --> 00:38:41,840
We’d come all the way
from a plantation in Africa, and the doctors couldn’t do a thing.

362
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,841
She begged me then,
day after day.

363
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:52,402
I got the drug for her,
carried it home.

364
00:38:54,162 --> 00:38:58,242
Then I couldn’t go through
with it. I hid it in a drawer.

365
00:38:58,322 --> 00:39:00,443
And she found it.

366
00:39:00,443 --> 00:39:04,243
I didn’t know
until just before she died.

367
00:39:04,563 --> 00:39:07,884
The pain was gone then.

368
00:39:07,924 --> 00:39:10,724
She smiled...

369
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:14,445
and held my hand
while she fell asleep.

370
00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:19,645
I sat there for hours,
holding her hand,

371
00:39:20,526 --> 00:39:23,886
watching the clock.

372
00:39:28,287 --> 00:39:30,687
Then it was dawn,

373
00:39:30,687 --> 00:39:34,288
and there wasn’t
any more pain.

374
00:39:34,528 --> 00:39:38,648
The court called it
a mercy killing. Sent me to an asylum.

375
00:39:38,728 --> 00:39:40,769
I wasn’t mad, you see,

376
00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:44,009
but the law
called for it.

377
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:47,730
I don’t know if I was right
even now.

378
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:51,850
Anyway, you know.

379
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,050
Yes.

380
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:57,171
It makes a difference?
No.

381
00:39:57,171 --> 00:40:00,651
I’d still like to help.

382
00:40:15,373 --> 00:40:19,214
What?
He was the one at Rennit’s office.

383
00:42:01,029 --> 00:42:02,349
All clear.

384
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:05,189
What time is it?

385
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,430
Almost 5:00.

386
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,710
Did you sleep?

387
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:14,791
I thought our friend with
the fingernails might come back.

388
00:42:15,191 --> 00:42:19,071
You won’t need to worry
where I’m taking you.

389
00:42:20,992 --> 00:42:24,272
Let’s leave.

390
00:42:33,553 --> 00:42:36,794
Here we are.

391
00:42:46,795 --> 00:42:49,596
Not a word. No murder,
no Bellane. Nothing.

392
00:42:49,596 --> 00:42:53,716
Why would the police keep it quiet?
I don’t know, but they have.

393
00:42:53,716 --> 00:42:57,357
Probably want
to keep me happy.

394
00:42:59,597 --> 00:43:02,157
Ah, miss Hilfe.
Come in.

395
00:43:02,157 --> 00:43:03,398
Come in.

396
00:43:03,398 --> 00:43:06,438
I’m sorry to disturb you
so early, Mr. Newland,

397
00:43:06,438 --> 00:43:08,638
but I had
to see you.

398
00:43:08,638 --> 00:43:12,279
You don’t visit me
often enough.

399
00:43:12,399 --> 00:43:15,439
And who is this young man?
Mr. Neale.

400
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:17,400
Mr. Newland.
How do you do?

401
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,480
In trouble, eh?
Come along.

402
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,721
You’re very lucky,
Mr. Neale, having this young lady for a friend.

403
00:43:25,241 --> 00:43:27,841
She’s always
helping people.

404
00:43:27,841 --> 00:43:29,361
You aren’t Austrian.
No, British.

405
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:33,642
He has to hide. He isn’t
guilty, but the police are looking for him.

406
00:43:33,642 --> 00:43:36,562
Fine, fine. The room
where Maria stayed, eh?

407
00:43:36,562 --> 00:43:40,163
Do you mind?
Not at all.

408
00:43:43,803 --> 00:43:45,044
What is it?

409
00:43:45,044 --> 00:43:49,324
The psychoanalysis of nazidom, by Dr. Forrester.

410
00:43:50,244 --> 00:43:53,965
That’s selling very well.
Bring a copy along if you like.

411
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:56,485
Thank you. I will.
Who is Dr. Forrester?

412
00:43:56,485 --> 00:43:59,726
He’s a psychiatrist.
Getting quite famous here.

413
00:43:59,726 --> 00:44:03,086
Sort of advisor to
the ministry of home security.

414
00:44:03,086 --> 00:44:06,127
Writes propaganda.
Interesting fellow too.

415
00:44:06,127 --> 00:44:09,927
Purchases books from me
now and then.

416
00:44:11,167 --> 00:44:14,448
Here you are.

417
00:44:18,328 --> 00:44:20,489
Customers.

418
00:44:20,489 --> 00:44:24,289
Sometimes I loathe
people who like to read.

419
00:44:40,652 --> 00:44:41,972
Customers.

420
00:44:50,693 --> 00:44:54,254
Ministry
of home security.

421
00:44:54,254 --> 00:44:56,774
It’s a nice place
to be an advisor.

422
00:44:56,774 --> 00:44:59,294
The heart of Britain’s defense system.
You don’t think he’s...

423
00:44:59,294 --> 00:45:03,375
he’s a friend of Mrs. Bellane’s.
Cost wasn’t after that cake because he was hungry.

424
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:07,695
That doesn’t make the doctor
a spy, just because he went to a séance,

425
00:45:08,136 --> 00:45:09,696
any more than you or Willi.

426
00:45:09,696 --> 00:45:12,936
I wonder if they’re listed
in your volunteers.

427
00:45:12,936 --> 00:45:17,217
Oh, now the mothers
of the free nations are turning into a spy ring.

428
00:45:18,097 --> 00:45:21,337
Next you’ll have me one.

429
00:45:21,337 --> 00:45:22,978
No. You don’t look like one.

430
00:45:22,978 --> 00:45:27,218
Well, you can forget it.
Willi and I have run that office for three years...

431
00:45:27,218 --> 00:45:30,739
and your dear old dowagers.
But Mrs. Bellane was listed.

432
00:45:30,739 --> 00:45:35,059
Why not some of the others?
Dr. Forrester, cost, newbie, miss Penteel?

433
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:39,580
The artist? Was she there?
You know her?

434
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:43,781
I’ve never met her,
but she has a studio in the old art center.

435
00:45:43,861 --> 00:45:47,941
She auctioned off some paintings for us.
A volunteer?

436
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:49,582
Yes.

437
00:45:49,582 --> 00:45:53,542
I’m going back to the office
and look through every card in our files.

438
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,703
Still angry?
Of course.

439
00:45:56,703 --> 00:46:00,263
A woman always hates to be wrong.
Good.

440
00:46:00,263 --> 00:46:03,504
Will you have dinner
with me tonight?

441
00:46:03,504 --> 00:46:06,864
I’ll meet you here.

442
00:46:30,947 --> 00:46:33,468
Well, Mr. Neale,
you do get about.

443
00:46:33,468 --> 00:46:36,108
I was just thinking
the same.

444
00:46:36,108 --> 00:46:38,349
Aren’t you afraid
of the police?

445
00:46:38,349 --> 00:46:39,589
When they’re nearby, yes.

446
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:44,109
It’d be a shame if they found
you there. The building has a bad enough reputation.

447
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:48,750
Won’t you come in?

448
00:46:53,391 --> 00:46:55,471
Going to hold a séance here?
No.

449
00:46:55,471 --> 00:46:59,552
The last one was
quite enough for a while, thanks to you.

450
00:47:02,192 --> 00:47:06,153
You don’t trust me?
No. Where’s miss Penteel?

451
00:47:07,153 --> 00:47:09,433
Shopping.
It’s just as well.

452
00:47:09,433 --> 00:47:13,194
You frightened her
to death once already.

453
00:47:13,994 --> 00:47:17,394
Won’t you sit down?

454
00:47:34,677 --> 00:47:38,277
Whiskey and soda?
Thank you.

455
00:47:48,759 --> 00:47:51,639
What did you have
against Mr. Cost?

456
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:55,080
I didn’t kill him,
and you know it.

457
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,840
You’re most attractive
when you’re lying.

458
00:48:02,801 --> 00:48:06,841
I’d even enjoy hearing you say
you were interested in me.

459
00:48:07,881 --> 00:48:09,122
I am.

460
00:48:10,282 --> 00:48:14,482
How did you know about me...
that microphone or whatever it was?

461
00:48:14,882 --> 00:48:18,163
I always try to frighten people
the first time they come to a séance.

462
00:48:18,163 --> 00:48:22,363
They love it.
I never thought it would make you start shooting.

463
00:48:22,363 --> 00:48:24,524
How did you know
about me?

464
00:48:24,524 --> 00:48:27,284
Your trial testimony
was in all the papers.

465
00:48:27,284 --> 00:48:29,644
My assistants keep
an excellent file on people.

466
00:48:29,644 --> 00:48:34,045
They couldn’t have looked me up as quickly as all that.
You’d be surprised.

467
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:36,245
You surprise me
continually.

468
00:48:36,245 --> 00:48:40,846
Did it ever occur to you
that some women like affection even better than conversation?

469
00:48:40,926 --> 00:48:45,167
So do some men,
if they’re sure they’re not gonna be shot any moment.

470
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:48,847
Take the bullets out of it if you want to.

471
00:48:48,847 --> 00:48:52,488
I only carry it
for protection.

472
00:48:53,488 --> 00:48:57,529
You don’t miss much.
I seem to be missing a lot today.

473
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:04,129
You’re a strange person.

474
00:49:04,129 --> 00:49:07,690
I tell you all my trade secrets,
and still you don’t trust me.

475
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:10,570
Why did you say you told
fortunes at Lembridge?

476
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:14,251
Why? Because I did.
I was there.

477
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:16,331
You weren’t the one
who told mine.

478
00:49:16,331 --> 00:49:20,572
That female battleship with the moons and stars?
That’s the one.

479
00:49:21,252 --> 00:49:23,212
Oh, she was some
Lembridge woman.

480
00:49:23,212 --> 00:49:27,533
She wanted to keep
the booth open after I left and practice her palmistry.

481
00:49:27,533 --> 00:49:29,853
She did,
and I got the cake.

482
00:49:29,853 --> 00:49:32,013
I suppose you don’t know
about that either.

483
00:49:32,013 --> 00:49:34,734
Of course.
But how did you get it?

484
00:49:34,734 --> 00:49:36,614
What was in it?
I don’t know.

485
00:49:36,614 --> 00:49:40,175
Was there supposed
to be something in it? That’s the truth.

486
00:49:40,175 --> 00:49:43,615
The lady in the cake booth
asked me to let her gentleman friend win it.

487
00:49:43,615 --> 00:49:48,176
If someone came to me and said,
“don’t bother about the past; tell me the future,”

488
00:49:48,256 --> 00:49:50,416
I was to give him
the correct weight.

489
00:49:50,416 --> 00:49:53,176
Did you say that?
Something like it.

490
00:49:53,176 --> 00:49:56,937
That explains it.
Now are you happy?

491
00:49:57,177 --> 00:50:00,658
I’ve got exactly nowhere.

492
00:50:00,738 --> 00:50:04,378
Neither have I.

493
00:50:10,179 --> 00:50:13,899
- Come in, Martha.
- Police! Help!

494
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:18,180
Murder! Police! Police!
She would.

495
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,860
I’ll keep the gun.
To remember me by?

496
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:24,141
You might need it.
You should know.

497
00:50:24,141 --> 00:50:27,621
Won’t I see you again?

498
00:50:28,622 --> 00:50:29,862
Yes.

499
00:50:40,223 --> 00:50:44,144
Oh, there you are.
I was worried about you last night.

500
00:50:44,144 --> 00:50:48,104
That was a pasting.
I know. I got caught in it.

501
00:50:48,905 --> 00:50:52,905
What’s this? A housecleaning?
It’s going to be.

502
00:50:53,705 --> 00:50:57,986
We’ve been patriotically
slaving for three years to help a spy ring.

503
00:50:59,066 --> 00:51:02,907
What? Oh, nonsense.
Here. Look at these.

504
00:51:06,587 --> 00:51:09,828
“Adamson.”
Never heard of him. “aiken.”

505
00:51:09,828 --> 00:51:12,588
Both recommended
by Dr. Forrester.

506
00:51:12,588 --> 00:51:16,108
“Alpock.”
Dr. Forrester.

507
00:51:18,109 --> 00:51:21,669
“Cost.”
Newby, Penteel, all those at the séance.

508
00:51:21,669 --> 00:51:24,190
All recommended
by Dr. Forrester!

509
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:28,070
And he works for the
ministry of home security.

510
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:33,831
How did these get in our files?
I don’t know.

511
00:51:38,632 --> 00:51:40,672
Get Mrs. Merrick in here.

512
00:51:44,512 --> 00:51:48,393
Yes?
Do you know how these cards got here?

513
00:51:50,553 --> 00:51:54,354
Mr. Aiken. Oh, yes.
I remember filing him.

514
00:51:55,034 --> 00:51:56,874
His name
struck me as so odd.

515
00:51:56,874 --> 00:52:00,875
This is one of the batches you mailed me.
I mailed you?

516
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:04,635
Yes, from Kent, while you were
on your holidays last year.

517
00:52:04,635 --> 00:52:08,356
I’ve never seen them before.
Oh, but I’m sure, miss Hilfe.

518
00:52:08,356 --> 00:52:12,517
They’re just
as you always send them from meetings and such.

519
00:52:13,397 --> 00:52:17,237
I, uh, I may be wrong.
Thank you, Mrs. Merrick.

520
00:52:17,237 --> 00:52:20,558
Oh, not at all.

521
00:52:23,118 --> 00:52:25,078
They even know
how we mail our cards.

522
00:52:25,078 --> 00:52:28,959
They’re Nazis, Willi.
I know it. The same as they were in Austria.

523
00:52:28,959 --> 00:52:30,679
It’s the way
they work all around you,

524
00:52:30,679 --> 00:52:34,160
knowing about
everybody, everything, where to find you.

525
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,320
That night they hunted us!
Carla!

526
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,480
Not the old fear again.
We aren’t there now.

527
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,921
But they’re here in London.
You’re imagining too much.

528
00:52:42,921 --> 00:52:47,242
Something’s going on,
but you can’t charge people with being Nazis...

529
00:52:47,282 --> 00:52:51,722
just because they belong
to a charity, especially an advisor to the ministry.

530
00:52:51,922 --> 00:52:53,722
The police
would laugh at us.

531
00:52:53,722 --> 00:52:57,483
That is what I told Stephen
at first.

532
00:52:58,763 --> 00:53:00,043
Stephen?
Mr. Neale.

533
00:53:00,083 --> 00:53:04,284
He’s the one that thought
of searching the cards, and he was right.

534
00:53:04,284 --> 00:53:07,844
I’m going to show them to him.
Wait a minute.

535
00:53:07,844 --> 00:53:10,765
How did you get in touch with him?
He telephoned for you.

536
00:53:10,765 --> 00:53:14,445
He’s safe now. I took him to
the bookshop where I hid Maria.

537
00:53:14,445 --> 00:53:17,766
I wish you hadn’t done that.
Why not? You’re helping him.

538
00:53:17,766 --> 00:53:21,966
Yes, I know, but I’d rather
you didn’t get mixed up with him.

539
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:27,287
But why, Willi?
You don’t think he killed that man cost?

540
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:32,048
I didn’t... then.
I’ve checked up on him.

541
00:53:32,368 --> 00:53:35,728
He was sentenced for murder two years ago.
He told me.

542
00:53:35,728 --> 00:53:39,929
But it wasn’t murder.
Even the court called it a mercy killing.

543
00:53:39,969 --> 00:53:43,730
And you still want to help him?
Yes.

544
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:51,051
You’re not falling in love
with him by any chance?

545
00:53:51,211 --> 00:53:54,531
Yes, very much.

546
00:53:58,732 --> 00:54:03,012
I can go to the
ministry of home security, at least try to tell them.

547
00:54:03,612 --> 00:54:05,013
They’d suspect you
before anyone else.

548
00:54:05,013 --> 00:54:08,773
It’s your organization.
You’re aliens. You can’t take that chance.

549
00:54:08,773 --> 00:54:12,174
We took longer chances
than this in Austria.

550
00:54:12,174 --> 00:54:15,694
You’re not afraid?
Yes.

551
00:54:15,694 --> 00:54:17,855
Good. So am I.

552
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:22,415
When I left Lembridge, I told
Dr. Morton I was coming to London to spend a quiet life.

553
00:54:23,215 --> 00:54:25,576
It’s been like riding
down the side of a whirlpool.

554
00:54:25,576 --> 00:54:29,936
From what you say about
the ministry, Willi and I are only a half turn behind you.

555
00:54:29,936 --> 00:54:34,497
We’ll get out of it all right,
even if I have to drown some of these free mothers first.

556
00:54:36,337 --> 00:54:39,658
You wouldn’t object?
No.

557
00:54:39,658 --> 00:54:42,778
Someday when I get back
to that quiet life,

558
00:54:42,778 --> 00:54:46,499
I want to ask you if you’d
be interested in it too.

559
00:54:46,499 --> 00:54:50,419
Willi asked me if I was
falling in love with you.

560
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,740
And?

561
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:58,540
I said, “yes.”

562
00:55:12,222 --> 00:55:15,183
Newland’s bookshop.
Oh, Dr. Forrester!

563
00:55:15,183 --> 00:55:19,183
A pleasure to hear from you,
sir. I found a set for you.

564
00:55:19,543 --> 00:55:22,224
Oxford medicine
by Christian.

565
00:55:22,224 --> 00:55:25,144
Nineteen volumes.
Is that correct?

566
00:55:25,144 --> 00:55:29,145
Tonight? I don’t know.
You’re quite far out.

567
00:55:31,025 --> 00:55:34,666
Oh, here?
Just a moment.

568
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:39,946
Regai... court.

569
00:55:40,346 --> 00:55:43,667
Flat... 29.

570
00:55:44,787 --> 00:55:46,987
Has the porter a key?

571
00:55:46,987 --> 00:55:50,868
Right. I’ll have it there
before blackout time.

572
00:55:52,068 --> 00:55:55,829
Miss Hilfe,
did you hear that?

573
00:55:56,989 --> 00:55:58,229
Yes!

574
00:56:00,549 --> 00:56:04,830
Nineteen volumes.
Are you two going out to get some dinner tonight?

575
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:10,831
We’ll drop them off for you.
Would you? Thank you very much.

576
00:56:10,911 --> 00:56:13,751
A book is all right
for mental stimulation,

577
00:56:13,751 --> 00:56:16,112
but if there’s
anything I loathe,

578
00:56:16,112 --> 00:56:20,312
it’s struggling
about the streets with great quantities of print.

579
00:56:28,113 --> 00:56:31,514
You spoke of the porter.
Won’t the doctor be there?

580
00:56:31,514 --> 00:56:33,994
No, he’s out
at his nursing home.

581
00:56:33,994 --> 00:56:37,995
Has a collection of maniacs
he psychoanalyzes.

582
00:56:45,156 --> 00:56:49,196
It’s regal court, flat 29.
The porter will let you in.

583
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:53,997
Put them anywhere,
and, please, don’t forget my valise.

584
00:56:54,797 --> 00:56:57,838
Leather’s hard to get.
All right.

585
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:01,398
Thank heaven
for youth and strength.

586
00:57:01,398 --> 00:57:05,599
Twenty-nine? Yes, sir.
Mr. Travers left orders to let you in.

587
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,519
Travers? But these are
for Dr. Forrester.

588
00:57:08,519 --> 00:57:11,559
You must be wrong, sir.
We haven’t any Dr. Forrester.

589
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:15,280
But 29 is right,
and Mr. Travers is expecting books.

590
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,801
We have had some incorrect
names, sir, where a gentleman has a hideout from his wife.

591
00:57:20,121 --> 00:57:24,281
But those gentlemen
were not spending their time with books.

592
00:57:27,282 --> 00:57:29,442
There you are, sir.
Thank you.

593
00:57:29,442 --> 00:57:32,763
Not at all, sir.

594
00:57:34,163 --> 00:57:37,443
Travers, eh?

595
00:57:44,684 --> 00:57:48,085
He needs a few books.

596
00:58:13,808 --> 00:58:15,489
Nobody lives here.

597
00:58:15,489 --> 00:58:19,369
No cigarettes, no personal
belongings, nothing.

598
00:58:29,171 --> 00:58:32,531
The line’s dead.

599
00:58:45,613 --> 00:58:49,694
We’ll save Mr. Newland’s leather
and get out of this place.

600
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:35,420
Awake, eh?

601
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:40,501
You’ve been hard to find,
Mr. Neale.

602
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:48,702
Who was the girl?

603
00:59:48,702 --> 00:59:52,583
What girl?
That went into the flat with you.

604
00:59:52,583 --> 00:59:56,823
I was alone.
You were when we found you. The porter saw her go in.

605
00:59:58,183 --> 01:00:00,944
That’s very interesting.

606
01:00:00,944 --> 01:00:04,904
A mysterious girl.
I don’t see her, and you don’t,

607
01:00:05,504 --> 01:00:08,465
but the porter does.

608
01:00:08,465 --> 01:00:10,465
Did you kill her too?

609
01:00:10,465 --> 01:00:13,506
You’re much better
at that occupation...

610
01:00:13,506 --> 01:00:16,466
with your bombs in suitcases.

611
01:00:16,466 --> 01:00:18,386
Now it’s my bomb, eh?

612
01:00:18,386 --> 01:00:19,346
Or one of your Nazi friends.

613
01:00:19,346 --> 01:00:23,707
Nazis, bombs. They
shouldn’t have let you out of that asylum, Mr. Neale.

614
01:00:25,187 --> 01:00:28,748
We ought to have a record of all this.
I’ve said all I have to say.

615
01:00:28,748 --> 01:00:32,428
You’ll say quite a bit more
before you leave here.

616
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:36,149
And just where am I?
Scotland yard.

617
01:00:37,589 --> 01:00:40,950
Where’d you think?

618
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:44,230
Inspector?

619
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:50,151
Stephen Neale,
questioning by inspector prentice.

620
01:00:50,151 --> 01:00:53,951
28-lj-14.Murder.

621
01:00:54,872 --> 01:00:56,592
I didn’t kill him!

622
01:00:56,592 --> 01:01:00,312
Who didn’t you kill?
Cost, at Mrs. Bellane’s place.

623
01:01:00,312 --> 01:01:01,953
We haven’t heard
about that one.

624
01:01:01,953 --> 01:01:05,873
But the police were there,
where we had the séance.

625
01:01:06,233 --> 01:01:07,753
There’s been no
such murder reported.

626
01:01:07,753 --> 01:01:11,914
A friend of mine saw them. They questioned him.
What friend?

627
01:01:14,154 --> 01:01:16,755
You wouldn’t know him.

628
01:01:16,755 --> 01:01:18,275
They must have
posed as police too.

629
01:01:18,275 --> 01:01:21,675
Who?
The people at the séance, the ones who tried to kill me.

630
01:01:21,675 --> 01:01:25,516
They’re enemy agents...
Mrs. Bellane, Dr. Forrester, the psychiatrist.

631
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:28,796
Forrester?
Not the advisor to the ministry?

632
01:01:28,796 --> 01:01:33,117
Yes! He telephoned Newland
at his bookshop to kill me with that bomb!

633
01:01:36,398 --> 01:01:39,158
Have the doctor
give him a sedative. I’ll talk to him later.

634
01:01:39,158 --> 01:01:42,118
Wait. You asked for
the truth. You listen to it.

635
01:01:42,118 --> 01:01:45,679
I have all their names.
Look at the cards in my coat.

636
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:48,959
There weren’t any cards
in your coat. Spies, séances.

637
01:01:48,959 --> 01:01:52,920
You’ve been very careful not to mention George Rennit.
Rennit?

638
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:56,960
When you’re ready
to tell me what you did to him, let me know.

639
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,441
I didn’t do
anything to him.

640
01:02:01,841 --> 01:02:04,642
No, I didn’t think so.
Of course, you didn’t.

641
01:02:04,642 --> 01:02:06,682
He left his office
with you, wasn’t seen again alive.

642
01:02:06,682 --> 01:02:09,842
His body was found
near Battersea bridge. He was bludgeoned.

643
01:02:09,842 --> 01:02:12,203
You are charged with
his deliberate murder.

644
01:02:12,203 --> 01:02:13,723
I don’t know
what happened to him.

645
01:02:13,723 --> 01:02:16,563
I didn’t know he disappeared
until I got back to his office.

646
01:02:16,563 --> 01:02:20,124
Well, that’s better.
You were with him then.

647
01:02:20,124 --> 01:02:23,684
Yes, I retained him to find out
why they tried to kill me.

648
01:02:23,684 --> 01:02:27,125
They were after something
hidden in a cake that I won.

649
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:30,725
Cake?
I know I sound insane.

650
01:02:31,245 --> 01:02:34,686
You are without doubt.

651
01:02:37,166 --> 01:02:40,647
Inspector, wait, please.

652
01:02:45,968 --> 01:02:46,848
I know my record.

653
01:02:46,848 --> 01:02:50,688
You can send me back to the
asylum on any charge. I don’t care what you do with me.

654
01:02:50,688 --> 01:02:55,209
But you can’t take it on
yourself to say German agents aren’t working here in London.

655
01:02:55,329 --> 01:02:58,969
You saw that bombed apartment.
I tell you, they did it.

656
01:02:58,969 --> 01:03:01,530
I ask you for one
fair chance to prove it.

657
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:02,730
Name it.

658
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:04,810
It’s a long chance, but
it’s the only one I have.

659
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:07,211
There’s a bomb crater
at black moor factory near Lembridge.

660
01:03:07,211 --> 01:03:11,691
I want to search around it
to see if there’s any trace of what was in that cake.

661
01:03:13,611 --> 01:03:17,132
There was a cake.

662
01:03:36,495 --> 01:03:39,735
Where was he standing?

663
01:03:39,735 --> 01:03:43,176
Here, by the corner.

664
01:03:45,136 --> 01:03:48,857
Here.
Cover every bit of ground.

665
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:18,261
Here is a coat.

666
01:04:19,501 --> 01:04:22,941
Or what’s left of it.

667
01:04:32,343 --> 01:04:35,823
The blind man’s?
Yes.

668
01:05:07,788 --> 01:05:11,348
It’s the piece
from that gun.

669
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:26,551
Rather convenient for you to find it.
At least I was here.

670
01:05:26,551 --> 01:05:29,231
It might be your gun
that you used on him.

671
01:05:29,231 --> 01:05:31,631
There’s nothing
about spies on it.

672
01:05:31,631 --> 01:05:35,472
Inspector, is this anything?
The cake box!

673
01:05:35,832 --> 01:05:39,152
Or part of it!

674
01:05:42,673 --> 01:05:46,954
Where was it?
The edge of the crater. A bird was pecking away at it.

675
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:56,475
Where’d he find it?

676
01:06:00,315 --> 01:06:04,356
It must be here somewhere!
If we could sift this dirt!

677
01:06:04,556 --> 01:06:08,397
Drive over to the factory.
Get some screens and shovels.

678
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:09,717
Yes, sir.

679
01:06:25,959 --> 01:06:29,160
He was ruddy well
scattered about.

680
01:06:38,441 --> 01:06:40,521
That does it, sir.

681
01:06:40,521 --> 01:06:43,762
Satisfied?

682
01:06:44,602 --> 01:06:48,122
Pack up.
Very good, sir.

683
01:07:55,092 --> 01:07:58,652
I never used
to like birds.

684
01:08:11,014 --> 01:08:13,695
What is it?

685
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:17,575
Drawings or something.
We’ll ask the ministry.

686
01:08:43,179 --> 01:08:45,339
Watkins.
Turn it off.

687
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:54,380
I don’t know how they could
have been photographed. I assume full responsibility.

688
01:08:56,101 --> 01:08:58,981
They’ve only been
out :

689
01:08:58,981 --> 01:09:02,782
For the Saturday conference
and yesterday.

690
01:09:04,902 --> 01:09:08,542
They would have killed more
than one man to recover these, Mr. Neale.

691
01:09:08,542 --> 01:09:11,983
They’re the new
embarkation plans on our channel minefields.

692
01:09:11,983 --> 01:09:15,303
We’ve been a great help.
Mr. Neale can identify some of them, sir.

693
01:09:15,303 --> 01:09:17,624
With your permission,
I’ll get along with arresting them.

694
01:09:17,624 --> 01:09:19,864
They might still have prints.
I doubt it.

695
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:22,024
Or they wouldn’t have
gone to such lengths to recover the negative.

696
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:24,345
I don’t think
we can take it for granted that the charts are safe.

697
01:09:24,345 --> 01:09:28,825
I don’t either. I think someone
came here and photographed them again yesterday.

698
01:09:30,186 --> 01:09:33,626
You said they were out of the vault again?
Yes.

699
01:09:33,626 --> 01:09:37,227
This Dr. Forrester?
He hasn’t been here for two weeks.

700
01:09:37,227 --> 01:09:41,747
He’s done splendid work
for the ministry, inspector. Hard to believe he’s involved.

701
01:09:42,147 --> 01:09:46,268
Perhaps not, sir.
Were any of his friends here both days?

702
01:09:46,868 --> 01:09:48,828
Not that I know of.

703
01:09:48,828 --> 01:09:52,269
That tailor he recommended
was here again yesterday.

704
01:09:52,269 --> 01:09:56,109
Measured Parkins for a suit.
Mr. Travers?

705
01:09:56,149 --> 01:09:57,229
May I speak, sir?
Surely.

706
01:09:57,229 --> 01:10:01,670
Someone named Travers
leased that apartment where inspector prentice found me.

707
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:05,431
Could you tell me his firm, sir?
Travers & Brathwaite.

708
01:10:05,431 --> 01:10:09,191
May I use your phone?
Thank you, sir.

709
01:10:13,472 --> 01:10:17,432
Would you get me
Travers & Brathwaite, tailors?

710
01:10:18,713 --> 01:10:21,313
Are you there?
This is Mr. Pauling.

711
01:10:21,313 --> 01:10:25,514
Would it be possible
to be measured for a suit this afternoon?

712
01:10:26,034 --> 01:10:28,554
5:30? I’ll be there.
Thank you.

713
01:10:28,554 --> 01:10:32,074
With your
permission, sir.

714
01:10:46,157 --> 01:10:49,597
Mrs. Bellane,
209 Campden lane.

715
01:10:49,597 --> 01:10:51,557
Miss Penteel,
old art center.

716
01:10:51,557 --> 01:10:54,478
She keeps yelping for the police
every time she sees me.

717
01:10:54,478 --> 01:10:57,718
Newland,
Newland’s bookshop. That’s all.

718
01:10:57,718 --> 01:11:01,239
Bring them in.
Yes, sir.

719
01:11:05,319 --> 01:11:09,400
Why are you protecting that girl?
There wasn’t any girl.

720
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,880
And that friend
you mentioned?

721
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,800
I’ve told you
everything I know that can be of help.

722
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,441
My friends have
nothing to do with it. I don’t want them involved.

723
01:11:17,441 --> 01:11:20,321
That’s a fair answer.

724
01:11:20,321 --> 01:11:23,802
Follow me in five minutes.

725
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:52,846
Good afternoon.
Oh, good afternoon. What can we do for you, sir?

726
01:11:52,846 --> 01:11:55,606
I’d like to see Mr. Travers, please.
Certainly, sir.

727
01:11:55,606 --> 01:11:59,247
Won’t you please
take a chair?

728
01:11:59,287 --> 01:12:02,968
I’ll tell him
you’re waiting, sir.

729
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:20,210
The gentleman
over there, sir.

730
01:12:24,011 --> 01:12:27,451
One moment, Mr. Pauling.

731
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:31,892
Good tweeds here, Travers.
Thank you, sir.

732
01:12:31,892 --> 01:12:35,812
Good afternoon, Mr. Travers.
Good afternoon.

733
01:12:35,972 --> 01:12:38,333
You wish to see me, sir?

734
01:12:38,333 --> 01:12:41,213
There’s no one
I’d rather see.

735
01:12:41,213 --> 01:12:45,094
Oh, I don’t understand.
Excuse me one moment.

736
01:13:04,976 --> 01:13:06,737
Hello? Mr. Macklin?

737
01:13:06,737 --> 01:13:09,177
This is
Travers & Brathwaite.

738
01:13:09,177 --> 01:13:12,097
Your suit was dispatched
an hour ago, sir.

739
01:13:12,097 --> 01:13:15,218
I trust in time
for your journey.

740
01:13:15,218 --> 01:13:19,619
Thank you very much, sir.
I felt very satisfied myself at the last fitting.

741
01:13:22,139 --> 01:13:26,780
Oh, yes, sir. I think when
you’ve worn it once, you’ll find the shoulders will settle.

742
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:36,061
No, sir, I find we’ll not
be able to repeat the trousers.

743
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:41,302
Oh, it isn’t
a matter of coupons, sir.

744
01:13:41,302 --> 01:13:45,182
The manufacturers
have no more of the pattern.

745
01:13:45,422 --> 01:13:49,063
Personally,
I have no hope, sir.

746
01:13:49,183 --> 01:13:51,823
No hope at all.
Gentlemen...

747
01:13:51,823 --> 01:13:55,304
what is it?
Prentice!

748
01:14:11,266 --> 01:14:15,027
He’s cost,
the one at the séance.

749
01:14:26,828 --> 01:14:28,148
Excuse me.

750
01:14:32,069 --> 01:14:35,029
That’s Travers.
Travers, huh?

751
01:14:35,029 --> 01:14:38,590
Travers!
What happened?

752
01:14:57,353 --> 01:14:58,633
Hello?

753
01:15:00,633 --> 01:15:01,913
Hello?

754
01:15:03,553 --> 01:15:06,914
Is anyone there?

755
01:15:40,839 --> 01:15:41,679
Oh.
Oh.

756
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:46,080
Why didn’t you deliver Mr. Macklin’s suit?
I did, just before I came here.

757
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,720
You must have gotten
to the wrong address.

758
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:52,881
No, sir,
46 prince consort mansions, like it had on the box.

759
01:15:53,801 --> 01:15:56,681
That’s all right then.

760
01:15:56,721 --> 01:15:59,562
Mr. Travers
was quite put out.

761
01:15:59,562 --> 01:16:00,802
Oh?

762
01:16:46,808 --> 01:16:50,289
Neale! Why, Carla said...

763
01:16:51,529 --> 01:16:54,889
come in here, man.
We thought you’d been killed.

764
01:16:54,889 --> 01:16:56,170
Not quite.

765
01:16:56,410 --> 01:17:00,010
Carla took me back
to that apartment. You disappeared.

766
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:02,251
What happened?
Is she here?

767
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:05,051
Yes! Carla!

768
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:10,252
Finally saved up enough coupons
to buy a decent suit.

769
01:17:10,452 --> 01:17:11,812
Carla!

770
01:17:11,852 --> 01:17:15,772
yes?

771
01:17:18,213 --> 01:17:21,973
He isn’t a ghost.
You’d better tell her.

772
01:17:31,735 --> 01:17:34,095
Why did you come here?
Why not?

773
01:17:34,095 --> 01:17:38,096
The man saved your life.
Aren’t you going to thank him?

774
01:17:38,496 --> 01:17:42,696
He’ll kill you!
He’s the one who tried to kill us with that bomb.

775
01:17:43,777 --> 01:17:46,177
He gives the orders,
not Dr. Forrester.

776
01:17:46,177 --> 01:17:49,537
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
There wasn’t much else to do.

777
01:17:49,537 --> 01:17:53,498
You were both
finding out too much, and you wouldn’t stop.

778
01:17:53,498 --> 01:17:55,338
It was too good
a charity to lose.

779
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:56,978
And you’d kill
your sister to save it?

780
01:17:56,978 --> 01:18:01,379
You killed your wife.
People do such things under the strain of necessity.

781
01:18:03,059 --> 01:18:06,100
We’ve always been very close.

782
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:09,900
I was really happy
when I found her alive.

783
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:13,741
Put your hat and coat on.
We are leaving.

784
01:18:14,821 --> 01:18:16,181
Vorwarts!

785
01:18:21,502 --> 01:18:24,702
The trouble with me is
I like people too much.

786
01:18:24,702 --> 01:18:28,623
I liked you at first.
That’s why I tried to frighten you out of London.

787
01:18:28,623 --> 01:18:31,423
I was quite happy
letting you hit me on the jaw.

788
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:33,304
I’m fond of
that memory myself.

789
01:18:33,304 --> 01:18:35,824
But you are
a persistent man, Neale.

790
01:18:35,824 --> 01:18:39,344
If I had known that
you were going to keep on messing about,

791
01:18:39,344 --> 01:18:42,985
you would never have left
Mrs. Bellane’s alive.

792
01:18:42,985 --> 01:18:45,145
Are you ready, Carla?

793
01:18:45,145 --> 01:18:46,386
Yes.

794
01:18:46,586 --> 01:18:50,746
It’s a pity, Neale.
You could have led a very peaceful life.

795
01:18:50,986 --> 01:18:54,147
The films are sewed up
in that suit, aren’t they?

796
01:18:54,147 --> 01:18:56,427
Oh, yes. Cost said
the shoulders would settle.

797
01:18:56,427 --> 01:19:00,628
Killing me won’t get you
out of England, Hilfe. You’re through.

798
01:19:37,633 --> 01:19:41,113
Give me the gun, Carla.

799
01:19:43,914 --> 01:19:47,274
Give me the coat.

800
01:20:02,556 --> 01:20:06,317
You wouldn’t shoot
your brother, Carla.

801
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,041
Come.

802
01:21:02,645 --> 01:21:06,126
They’re on the stairs!

803
01:21:18,087 --> 01:21:20,248
Can you make it?
Yes.

804
01:21:20,248 --> 01:21:21,568
Come on!

805
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:54,212
Turn out the lights
down there!

806
01:22:04,774 --> 01:22:08,415
Are they coming?
I don’t know.

807
01:22:20,016 --> 01:22:23,817
Give me the other magazine
out of the coat.

808
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:46,460
I’ve always
dreamed of having a church wedding.

809
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:50,461
We’ll have music and flowers and a big cake.
Cake!
