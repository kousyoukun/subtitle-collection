1
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:58,400
Miss Lee.

2
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Good evening, Mr. Chester.

3
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:11,467
You sure you know don't know
what this party's all about?

4
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:13,933
No, darling.
I honestly don't.

5
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,267
- Hi, boss.
- Good evening, Harry.

6
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:22,300
* For Lani's eyes
have told me *

7
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:44,333
Please darling don't let him
upset your evening.

8
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,933
To end the mystery of this
surprise party, I am your host
tonight.

9
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:57,500
My name is Roger Kong.

10
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,900
A very dear friend of mine
has written a song about the
Islands.

11
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,333
I heard it the other
night and loved it.

12
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,733
That is why I have arranged
this premier presentation.

13
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:09,700
It is called the
"Polynesian Rhapsody".

14
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,300
It is about a man's great
love for Hawaii.

15
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,267
Mr. Chet Chester.

16
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,533
Hawaii, I came.
Unwilling, a stranger to you.

17
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,267
Sick and weary,
bitter and tired.

18
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:07,967
All hope dissolved,
heart despairing.

19
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:11,467
But when hearing music,

20
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:13,600
I opened tear-sodden eyes.

21
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,167
And beauty and color
rushed to embrace me.

22
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:18,267
To warm me, to heal me,

23
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:20,333
To make me whole again.

24
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,667
And the murmuring waves
and tropic trade winds

25
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:28,433
Beat into my consciousness
an unceasing rhapsody of tide,
muted hollow.

26
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:33,900
When rain drops perform silver
ballet over white-skirted
sea.

27
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:32,400
What are you doing back
in the Islands?

28
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,167
Unfinished business.

29
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:39,333
Business? Your business ended
when Chet broke up the syndicate
four years ago.

30
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:43,200
The partnership of you, himself
and Roger Kong was over then.

31
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,767
He paid you both off.

32
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:47,867
Maybe I want to get
paid off again.

33
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:54,667
What does the "or" and the
question mark stand for,
Mr. Novak?

34
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:59,600
That either he leaves, so that I
can start up the syndicate,

35
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,167
And everything that went
with it again,

36
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:05,700
And run it all by myself
with a free hand.

37
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:14,533
Or... a hundred thousand dollars
in cash and I'll leave the
Islands.

38
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:17,133
And if he refuses?

39
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,367
Case history of Chest Chester.

40
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,600
This could get your boy locked
up for the rest of his natural
life.

41
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,467
And you would go right
along with him.

42
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:43,433
Yeah. But I've got
nothing to lose.

43
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:47,367
But Chet, he held
on to his dough.

44
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:49,433
He's got plenty to lose...
everything.

45
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:57,033
However, for a measly hundred
thousand, this will disappear.

46
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,200
Land of Aloha,
of song, of welcome.

47
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:10,867
From Pali to Kaneohe Bay.

48
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:15,967
Languorous, idyllic,
where trade winds play.

49
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:20,667
Where all races are one,
with one another and God.

50
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,967
Where joy is in the living.

51
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:24,867
Where paradise is now.

52
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:29,867
Island of contentment,
of tranquility.

53
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:32,300
Of full heart and
happy laughter.

54
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,333
You have given strength
to me who had lost it.

55
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,533
Restored my faith where
faith had waned.

56
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,300
Made strong my body,
which was all but withered.

57
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,967
Made harmony in my soul,
a man of me.

58
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,467
I love you.
I will never go.

59
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,400
I love you, Hawaii.

60
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,700
You are my life, my hope,
my faith.

61
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:05,033
With your bright and
shimmering music-filled
loveliness,

62
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:09,967
You are my golden dreams
at the rainbow's beginning.

63
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Why did you want to
come here?

64
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,400
You dirty rat.

65
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
Please, darling,
let's get out of here.

66
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,300
No, you never get
anywhere running away.

67
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,133
You understand, don't you, Chet?
I had to do it to protect you.

68
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:57,400
As long as he was around,
you'd never have been safe.

69
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,167
Never.

70
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:01,033
His heart was so full
of hate for you.

71
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:03,533
Yeah. And blackmail.

72
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,167
Did you read this?

73
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:08,767
No. No, I don't want to.

74
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:13,567
I know everything about you
I want to know.

75
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:15,233
Except one thing I could
never understand.

76
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:16,600
I've never liked Novak.

77
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,400
Why did you ever become partners
with a man like him?

78
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,267
It was nineteen forty,
before the war.

79
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:25,000
I was a stupid kid.

80
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,667
We pulled a bank job in
Riverside, California,
Novak and I.

81
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:31,033
Cops were after us
and we had to split up.

82
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:32,633
I had the money.

83
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:34,000
Well, when things quieted down,

84
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,400
I looked for him,
but I couldn't find him.

85
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,500
I joined the Navy,
and before I knew it,
I was shipped out.

86
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,067
How'd you happen
to meet him again?

87
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:44,533
It was after Pearl Harbor.

88
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,467
I sent for him.

89
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:49,867
Well, it was better for me to
send for him, than to have him
find me.

90
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:51,767
You know how it was around
here during the war.

91
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:54,667
The town was full of people
with money, easy money,

92
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:56,867
Just asking for guys like us
to take it away from them.

93
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:59,867
So, we took our dough
and formed a syndicate.

94
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:03,033
We needed somebody in the
Islands with connections,
so we found Roger.

95
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:07,300
Novak and I supplied
the money and the brains,

96
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,867
Roger the connections.

97
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,633
Well, now that he's out
of the way,

98
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:14,667
You're the only one who
knows about my past.

99
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:15,833
I never told Roger.

100
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,700
Even if he knew, Roger
wouldn't hurt you.

101
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,733
Now listen to me, Sally.

102
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,467
Listen carefully and
don't argue.

103
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:22,867
That note was meant for me.

104
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:25,233
If I'd gotten it first, I'd have
done exactly the same thing.

105
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:27,433
I killed Novak.
I did it in self-defense.

106
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:29,700
He tried to blackmail me.
There was a scuffle over a gun.

107
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,233
No, I won't let you.

108
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:32,667
You're to do exactly what I say.

109
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:35,133
I can get away with this thing
and you can't.

110
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,167
Why can't I?

111
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:38,867
What would you tell the jury?

112
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:40,733
I'd tell them the truth.

113
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:43,167
And get put away for ten,
twenty years?

114
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:45,167
Not you, Sally.

115
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:47,600
But I want you to be safe,
Chet.

116
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,000
I'll be all right.
Now listen and do what I say.

117
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,300
You know that box at home
that has our safety deposit
box key in it?

118
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,067
- Yes.
- Would you take the key

119
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:56,700
And go to the vault in the bank
and take out $50,000 in cash?

120
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,900
But you'll have to wait for two
or three weeks until things cool
off.

121
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,600
- Two or three weeks!
- At least.

122
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,133
Then go to San Francisco
and see George, my lawyer.

123
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:05,433
You know the address.

124
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:08,433
I know his one abiding
passion... cash.

125
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:11,267
You give him the $50,000 and
he'll get me off clean as a
whistle.

126
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:14,767
All right, Chet. I will.

127
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:19,867
Oh, darling.
Darling, I love you so.

128
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:23,900
I've loved you ever since
that fist day.

129
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:27,167
And I remember every day since.

130
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:29,000
Aw, don't worry, darling.

131
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,867
I'll soon be out and things
will be good again.

132
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:34,267
You don't have to do
this for me.

133
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:36,433
I owe you too much already.

134
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:40,233
When I was burned and out of
my mind, you found me.

135
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:43,867
You brought me back,
you and these islands.

136
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:45,867
Oh Chet, what do we do now?

137
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:49,633
The same thing anybody does
when they're in trouble,
phone the police.

138
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:05,867
I love you, Hawaii.

139
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:10,500
You are my life, my hope,
my faith.

140
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,000
With your bright and shimmering
music-filled loveliness.

141
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,633
You are my golden dreams
at the rainbow's beginning.

142
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:23,867
Did you like the record?

143
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:27,867
- Very much.
- What's the matter?

144
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:31,433
You are my golden dreams
at the rainbow's beginning.

145
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:36,933
It's very strange.
I can almost swear...

146
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:38,400
You could almost swear
that what?

147
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,300
Golden dreams at the
rainbow's beginning.

148
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,733
There's an interesting
story about the composer.

149
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:47,067
He's over in Honolulu
awaiting trial for murder.

150
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,500
Murder?

151
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,567
Donna? Uh, Donna.
Wait a minute.

152
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,267
Donna?
Donna, what's going on?

153
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:27,900
I wish I knew.

154
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,600
I see you're bringing Randy back
from the dead again,

155
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,333
Or are you going to tell me
that old story

156
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:38,267
That you've never been able
to quite believe he is dead?

157
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:40,300
Read that inscription.

158
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:44,733
But I've told you over and over
again, you have to be wrong
about him.

159
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:46,400
He was killed at Pearl Harbor.

160
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,133
You received official notice
from the Navy, didn't you?

161
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,867
You mean the last line of
that... Polynesian Rhapsody?

162
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:00,267
Yes.

163
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:02,567
It was just a coincidence,
that's all.

164
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:04,567
I've got to find out
whether it is.

165
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:08,100
It's crazy. Can't you get it
through your head, he was
killed?

166
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,200
Frank, I simply have to
make sure. I must!

167
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,133
He must have been quite a guy.

168
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:17,467
He was. But that
isn't the point.

169
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:24,867
What is?

170
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:26,733
Calling off
our engagement?

171
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:29,900
Frank, I can't be engaged to you
if I'm still married to him.

172
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,600
Well, if it'll make you feel
better, we'll call Honolulu and
get a check on him.

173
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,033
No. No,
I'm going to Honolulu.

174
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:37,500
Well, I think
this is getting...

175
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,467
I'm sorry, Frank. But right now
I can't help what you think.

176
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:42,400
It's ridiculous.

177
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,767
- What is?
- The whole affair.

178
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:47,467
You've been
living in the past.

179
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:49,400
You're ruining your life,
destroying your future,

180
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,367
And the future and
the present of anybody
and everybody around you.

181
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:55,233
I've never heard you talk
like this before.

182
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:57,367
It's about time I did.

183
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:02,900
I'll get the tickets.

184
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,633
I'll be ready to leave
any time you say.

185
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:08,567
No, Frank.
It's better I go alone.

186
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:50,100
The Honolulu police station.

187
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,233
- Police station?
- Please.

188
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:55,500
Want to turn
yourself in, dear?

189
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,267
- I beg your pardon?
- I beg yours.

190
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:00,200
Always opening my big mouth.

191
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,167
Didn't you just come
in on the plane?

192
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,467
Yes, I did.

193
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:05,233
- You live in the Islands?
- No.

194
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:06,933
No, it's my first visit.

195
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,333
Oh ho ho.
A Malahihi.

196
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,867
- You had me fooled.
- A Mala who?

197
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:15,300
- That's a newcomer.
- Oh.

198
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,067
How long have you been in
the Islands?

199
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:20,100
Thirty-five years.

200
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,067
The name's O'Reilly.
Uh, Lida O'Reilly.

201
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:25,400
I was a school teacher
from Wisconsin.

202
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,067
I saved up my money and came
here for a two-week vacation.

203
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:30,900
Forgot to go back.

204
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,233
And now that I've told you
my life story, uh,

205
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:38,100
- maybe I could ask you
a question?
- Go ahead.

206
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,733
Why is it that a nice looking
young woman like you

207
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:45,167
Is making her first stop in the
Islands at the Honolulu Police
Station?

208
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:51,467
I have an appointment
to see Chief Dan.

209
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:52,867
And if you send me,
chief...

210
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:55,900
- Yes?

211
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,667
A Miss Williams who called you from the
mainland is here,

212
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,933
The one who said she was a
relative of Chet Chester.

213
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:03,133
Oh, yes. Send her in.

214
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:04,233
That'll be all, Ippy.

215
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,100
Oh, me come back tomorrow,
chief.

216
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,467
Maybe have some
hot information.

217
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:10,167
Thank you very much, chief.

218
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:12,267
Please, come in.

219
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,867
- Welcome to Hawaii.
- Thank you.

220
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:19,867
Please sit down.

221
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:28,600
Uh... our brief telephone
conversation last night has me
puzzled.

222
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,133
I was under the impression you
said it was in connection with a
man named Chet Chester.

223
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:35,300
Yes, it is.

224
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,933
I presume you know
Mr. Chester is in jail,
being held for murder.

225
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,333
Yes, I heard.

226
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,600
May I ask,
Mrs. Williams, uh,

227
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,033
What your interest is in him?

228
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:49,300
Well, I'll be brief.

229
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,567
Just before the war,
there was a young sailor,

230
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:54,467
His name was
Randy Williams.

231
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:57,633
He was attached to the
battleship Arizona.

232
00:17:57,633 --> 00:18:00,233
This was in 1941.

233
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:04,467
On December the seventh, he was
reported killed in action.

234
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:07,467
I fail to see the connection
with Chet Chester.

235
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:13,733
I have reason to believe that
Chet Chester and Randy Williams
are the same.

236
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:18,233
Bring in the file
on Chet Chester.

237
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:26,200
Mrs. Williams, what was your
relationship to this uh...
Randy Williams?

238
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:32,100
He was my husband, and the
father of my little boy.

239
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,967
I wasn't aware that uh...

240
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,867
Thank you, Sergeant.

241
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:46,700
Look at this.

242
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:51,933
Was it a wild goose chase?

243
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:56,867
It's...
I think it is Randy.

244
00:18:58,033 --> 00:19:01,267
But that mark on his face...

245
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:02,867
Didn't he have a scar like that?

246
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:05,300
No. No scar at all.

247
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:09,067
But, I think it's him.

248
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:11,867
Assuming that Chet is the man
in question,

249
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:13,633
I suppose you'd like to see him.

250
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:15,033
Yes, I would.

251
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:19,133
You can't see him today,
I'm afraid.

252
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:21,767
But I'll have him brought here
at noon tomorrow.

253
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:23,067
Can you be here then?

254
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:25,867
Yes, I'll be here.
Thank you.

255
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:44,667
Now, I've got it all
figured out.

256
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,467
You're one of those lady
journalists

257
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:49,867
And you're here to do a big
feature story on Hawaii.

258
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:52,133
- Wrong again.
- All right.

259
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:54,100
Then why are you here on Hawaii?

260
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:59,933
I came to see someone I...
I think I know.

261
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,900
Have you ever heard of a man
named Chet Chester?

262
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:09,467
Chester? Oh, sure. Sure. He
killed some no good hoodlum.

263
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:12,767
He's in prison. Are you
going there to visit him?

264
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:16,100
Yes, tomorrow with Chief Dan.

265
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,067
Do you know anything
else about him?

266
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:20,200
Yeah, but they're just rumors.

267
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,533
One rumor is that he uh, made a
pile of dough during the war
years,

268
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:26,300
And then sort of retired.

269
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:31,667
And now he owns the Hawaiian
Retreat and has a nice home
on Waikiki Beach.

270
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,100
My information was correct,
wasn't it?

271
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,100
You have reservations
on tonight's plane.

272
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,467
- Yes, I'm going to the
mainland.
- Why?

273
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:52,000
To help Chet
get out of prison.

274
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,633
Off the mainland?

275
00:20:53,633 --> 00:20:56,067
I'm sorry, Roger,
I can't tell you anymore.

276
00:20:56,067 --> 00:21:00,000
Maybe you can tell me who that
woman is that arrived in
Honolulu.

277
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,767
- What woman?
- Quit pretending, Sally.

278
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:06,633
You know who I am talking about.
That Williams dame.

279
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,267
Sorry, Roger.
But I don't know who you mean.

280
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:12,600
Sally, I warn you...
don't lie to me.

281
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,767
I... I get it now.

282
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:19,633
You're taking his money out,
aren't you?

283
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:21,767
You're hauling it out of
the Islands for him.

284
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:24,867
Every cent he's got.
All his loot.

285
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,267
- Loot?
- Yeah, loot.

286
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:29,467
The dough that I
helped him make.

287
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:34,033
The stuff the syndicate took in.
He sent for her, didn't he?

288
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:37,300
He's turning it
over to the two of you.

289
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,033
You're wrong, Roger.
He turned everything over to me.

290
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,767
Thanks.
Now I know.

291
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:46,333
You're in a position to lay
your hands on all his money.

292
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:48,767
That's right.

293
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,933
Where is it?

294
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:53,700
He's not going to cut me
out this time.

295
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,867
Out of what?

296
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:59,500
He paid you off a long time ago,
the same as Novak.

297
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,267
And what's left?
A fortune.

298
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:02,600
He's enjoying it alone.

299
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,700
Using it to make himself
important and good.

300
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,300
Good... how?

301
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,200
By giving a few lousy
dollars to a bunch of slobs.

302
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,867
Why do they need his help?

303
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:15,733
You're hateful when you
talk like this.

304
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:17,200
Those poor people need
everything they...

305
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,333
They need nothing.
They're used to the gutter.

306
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:23,300
- Let them stay in it.
- You're one of them.

307
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,867
Most of them are our people.

308
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:34,633
I take it back.
You aren't one of them.

309
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,867
You're not good enough.

310
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:04,033
Who is it that
you wish to see?

311
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:07,067
Oh. Miss Sally Lee.

312
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:12,133
- Do you work here?
- Why, yes. I work here.

313
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:13,400
Is Miss Lee in?

314
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,100
Oh, she's not expected
'til much later.

315
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,033
What is it you wish
to see her about?

316
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:20,767
It's business,
a private matter.

317
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:23,767
Perhaps I can wait inside.
I wouldn't mind waiting.

318
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:26,000
No. That is... uh...

319
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,767
It'll be much
too long to wait.

320
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:30,200
Nobody home?

321
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,667
No! Nobody home!

322
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:34,933
Oh, you have someone waiting?

323
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:37,067
Yes, that's right.
Good bye.

324
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,300
Did you see that man?
He seemed rather odd.

325
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,267
Oh, a lot of creeps on the
island just like anywhere else.

326
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:50,767
- You'll get used to it.
- I suppose so.

327
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:52,233
Have you got any plans tomorrow,

328
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:54,867
Other than your noon time
appointment with Chief Dan?

329
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:56,767
- No.
- Oh, good.

330
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:59,933
Then while you're on the island,
I'll be your guide,

331
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:01,700
Or your chaperone,
if you like.

332
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,400
I like. Make plans.

333
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,900
* Stars are falling
from the skies *

334
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,167
* They're falling
for my Lani *

335
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:16,367
* Falling stars are
in her eyes *

336
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:20,067
* For they adore my Lani

337
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:24,967
* Although she makes
me cry and cry

338
00:24:24,967 --> 00:24:28,667
* Although her lips
may scold me *

339
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:33,100
* I know she'll love me
by and by *

340
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,867
* For Lani's eyes
have told me *

341
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:07,300
Calm down. Calm down.

342
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,433
You make me feel like a mother,
helping her one and only to be a
bride.

343
00:25:11,433 --> 00:25:12,600
What's the matter,
Mrs. O?

344
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,733
Haven't you ever
been a mother?

345
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:15,633
Me? No.

346
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:16,900
And for a very
good reason.

347
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,567
I've never been
married or... or anything.

348
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:24,133
I wonder if he'll know me?

349
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:25,900
Maybe it isn't even him.

350
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,300
Well, if it is,
I wonder how it'll seem?

351
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,600
Didn't Chief Dan tell you to be
at his office by noon?

352
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,900
- Yes.
- Then we'd better
get a move on.

353
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,333
I wonder how it'll seem,
seeing him again...

354
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,567
Talking to him.

355
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,733
Fill it up.

356
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:51,233
Come on, Jamie, break down.

357
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:53,767
Why the nice little
automobile ride?

358
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:54,733
Where are we going?

359
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:56,700
Up to Chief Dan's office.

360
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,333
Oh, is he going to make an
honorary police captain out of
me

361
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,533
For killing a hoodlum
like Novak?

362
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:03,867
You're pretty sure you're going
to beat this rap, aren't
you?

363
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:05,500
- Sure, I'm sure.

364
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,167
Car 568.

365
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:12,433
Yes, sir. Yes, chief.

366
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,267
Yes, sir. Right away.

367
00:26:15,267 --> 00:26:17,000
What's up?

368
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,033
- We have to make a stop.
- Where?

369
00:26:30,967 --> 00:26:32,600
Hey, what is this?

370
00:26:36,867 --> 00:26:38,233
What are we doing here?

371
00:26:38,233 --> 00:26:41,133
Sorry, Chet. You'll have to
identify a body as next of kin.

372
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,667
I have no kin.

373
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,867
Well, you're the
closest thing to it.

374
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:46,433
Those are the regulations.

375
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,567
- Four-oh-four?
- Yeah, that's right.

376
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:01,500
What's the matter, Jamie?

377
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,200
Afraid I'll jump in one
of those boxes?

378
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:06,200
Go ahead.

379
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,733
Who did it?

380
00:27:24,733 --> 00:27:26,033
We don't know, Chet.

381
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:27,433
What do you mean,
you don't know?

382
00:27:27,433 --> 00:27:29,667
- We're working on it.
- You're working on it? You...

383
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:31,967
Please, Mr. Chester, just
make your identification.

384
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:36,333
OK, I'll do it.

385
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:40,367
- Name.
- Sally Lee.

386
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:44,867
- Age?
- Late twenties.

387
00:27:45,967 --> 00:27:47,100
Relationship?

388
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:54,333
Just... say a friend.

389
00:27:56,867 --> 00:27:58,133
That do it for you?

390
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:01,400
Come on, Chet.

391
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:06,167
I've got more important
work to do.

392
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,033
Sorry, Jamie.

393
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:33,967
I was saying, are there
any instructions or...

394
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:36,867
That won't be necessary now.

395
00:28:36,867 --> 00:28:40,000
A girl by the name of Sally Lee
has been murdered.

396
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,467
Chet Chester was taken to the
morgue to identify her body.

397
00:28:43,467 --> 00:28:45,167
No!

398
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:48,933
After he identified her, Chester
broke away from his guard.

399
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:50,900
He... he escaped?

400
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:58,100
No. I... I wouldn't
call it that.

401
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:02,467
I think he intends to find
Sally Lee's killer.

402
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,867
Is there anything I can...

403
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:12,867
Chief Dan, when was...
when did it happen?

404
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:15,267
Some time
yesterday afternoon.

405
00:29:15,267 --> 00:29:17,867
I went to visit
Sally Lee yesterday.

406
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:21,033
At the house?
The place on Waikiki Beach?

407
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:23,267
- Yes.
- Did you see her?

408
00:29:23,267 --> 00:29:26,600
No. The man...
he said he worked there...

409
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,000
He told me she wasn't home.

410
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,100
Man?
There were no servants there.

411
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,867
What time of day was this?

412
00:29:33,867 --> 00:29:36,400
About two or three o'clock.

413
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,067
Can you describe this man?

414
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:43,900
Well, he... he was...
um...

415
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,133
- Was he Chinese?
- Well, Oriental.

416
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:50,100
It's difficult for me to...

417
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,633
What you're trying to say is to
you, all Orientals look alike.

418
00:29:53,633 --> 00:29:56,033
Well, I could even be
wrong about that.

419
00:29:56,033 --> 00:30:00,000
He might be a...
mixture of nationalities.

420
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,433
But, I don't think so.

421
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,633
I know this. If I saw him again,
I'd know him.

422
00:30:04,633 --> 00:30:07,933
Good. Then for your sake,

423
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:10,867
I suggest you, uh,
stay around your hotel.

424
00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:14,833
If he's the murderer,
he knows you're the one
witness who can identify him.

425
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:17,300
As for Chet,
I'll keep you posted.

426
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,500
Thanks.

427
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:22,600
So, you didn't see him at all?

428
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,900
No, I didn't.

429
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,800
Back to the hotel?

430
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,433
Where would a man wanted
by the police hide out?

431
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:33,767
I imagine he'd head for
Hell's Half Acre.

432
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:36,833
Why? Who are you
looking for this time?

433
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:39,633
The same. Chet Chester.
He's out of jail. He escaped.

434
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:40,633
Uh-hmm.

435
00:30:40,633 --> 00:30:42,333
What was that place you said?

436
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:44,200
Hell's Half Acre?
What is that?

437
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,033
Oh, it's a shabby tenement
district that Honolulu's
not very proud of.

438
00:30:49,033 --> 00:30:52,467
Wouldn't the police guess he's
there and go in after him?

439
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:55,433
Oh, they might, but
they wouldn't get him.

440
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:58,333
There are three hundred ways
into Hell's Half Acre

441
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:00,800
And four hundred ways out
that they know of.

442
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,233
Are there any
young women in there?

443
00:31:03,233 --> 00:31:08,867
Yes. Taxi dancers, cheap,
painted, disillusioned little
ladies.

444
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,300
Some of them live there and work
in the nearby dance halls.

445
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:19,700
Maybe if the people down there
thought I was a taxi dancer,

446
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,933
I could ask questions.

447
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:25,467
And maybe word would
get to Chet Chester
that I wanted to see him.

448
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,667
Get me a job down there.

449
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:30,667
Honey, you're crazy.

450
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:33,367
If you knew what it was like,
you wouldn't even ask me.

451
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:36,900
You should see the creeps that
crawl around those dance halls.

452
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,000
And they don't go there
just to dance.

453
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,867
But it might be my last
chance to see him.

454
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:44,533
If he gets off the island,
I'll never find him.

455
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:48,133
Don't you see, I've got to
do it. Help me, please.

456
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:11,267
Is this Hell's Half Acre?

457
00:32:11,267 --> 00:32:15,167
Yeah. It's all in
behind these stores.

458
00:32:18,033 --> 00:32:20,600
You even walk like a lady.

459
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,667
Give it a little more swing
and sway, like this.

460
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:33,233
Yep. That is better.

461
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:37,367
Well, this is it.

462
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,033
All right, honey?
Change your mind?

463
00:33:02,033 --> 00:33:04,633
Want to get out of here?

464
00:33:04,633 --> 00:33:06,600
No. No, I'll stay.

465
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:09,367
- Hey, George?
- Yeah?

466
00:33:12,233 --> 00:33:14,400
Uh, this is Donna.
Friend of mine.

467
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,533
She's new here.
She needs a job.

468
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:17,967
Why?

469
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:20,733
Why do you think, you
ignorant knucklehead?

470
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:22,367
Because she's broke.

471
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:25,133
What do you expect,
a character reference?

472
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:27,533
All right, sister.
It's four bits a dance.

473
00:33:27,533 --> 00:33:28,633
We'll split it with you.

474
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:30,233
Turn in your tickets
at the end of the night.

475
00:33:30,233 --> 00:33:34,300
And oh uh... whatever you
make on the side...

476
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:37,867
Tips that is, is all yours.

477
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,267
OK honey, better join the
ladies in waiting.

478
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:43,533
And remember...

479
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:10,267
What's the matter? They just
fish you out of the deep freeze
or something?

480
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,367
Hey, I'm talking to you!

481
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:16,733
Well, the fifty cents is
for the dance.

482
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:20,500
If you want snappy dialogue,
it'll cost you extra.

483
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,867
Ho ho. That's good.

484
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:27,400
Psst!

485
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:10,867
Tubby? Tubby!

486
00:35:13,867 --> 00:35:16,233
I told you stay in hotel
and watch her.

487
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:18,700
Why you think I buy you suit
and everything?

488
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,067
Her go from hotel.

489
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:22,467
I saw. I now know
where she go.

490
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:25,333
- Very interesting place.
- Where?

491
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:28,467
Uh, such information
has great value, no?

492
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,333
- Paradise Ballroom.
- She's here in the Acre?

493
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,033
She taxi dance girl now.

494
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:40,033
Are you sure she
relative of Chester?

495
00:35:40,033 --> 00:35:43,367
Positive. She tell
Chief Dan. I heard.

496
00:35:43,367 --> 00:35:47,200
That means Chester is here.
No wonder he broke loose.

497
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,033
She come here to meet him.

498
00:35:49,033 --> 00:35:51,000
Ippy, you want to make
big pay?

499
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,100
I mean big, big pay?

500
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,600
Ippy always happy with money.

501
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,167
Find Chet Chester.

502
00:35:58,167 --> 00:36:00,967
The order is still
that you're to find
Chet Chester tonight.

503
00:36:00,967 --> 00:36:02,400
Shall we start with
Hell's Half Acre?

504
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,267
You'd better. And make it
a thorough raid.

505
00:36:04,267 --> 00:36:07,567
Bust it wide open
if you have to,
inch by inch, but find him!

506
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:08,867
Let's go, men.

507
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,267
Do you know a man by the
name of Chet Chester?

508
00:36:34,267 --> 00:36:37,267
Sure. He's big man in Islands.

509
00:36:37,267 --> 00:36:38,867
I've heard of him.

510
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:40,333
Lately?

511
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:43,633
I read the paper like
anybody else. Don't you?

512
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:45,033
I'd like to meet
up with him.

513
00:36:45,033 --> 00:36:47,200
Huh! So do the police.

514
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,533
But no talk now, just dance.

515
00:36:54,367 --> 00:36:56,400
Oh, Mr. Kong, what are you
doing down in this neighborhood?

516
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,733
Slumming.

517
00:36:57,733 --> 00:37:00,467
Well, if you care to dance we
have a new girl tonight.

518
00:37:00,467 --> 00:37:01,633
Yes, I know.

519
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,333
Looking for Chet?

520
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,567
You are, aren't you?

521
00:37:34,267 --> 00:37:37,367
Yes, I am.
Do you know him?

522
00:37:37,367 --> 00:37:39,467
He's a good friend of mine.

523
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:42,100
What were you doing in
Miss Lee's house?

524
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,200
Same thing you were.
Looking for her.

525
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,600
I had a message for her
from Chet.

526
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,467
You told me you were
working there.

527
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:53,867
Delivering a personal
message is work.

528
00:37:53,867 --> 00:37:55,733
You know, I should call
the police.

529
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:58,733
Go ahead. But they can't
lead you to Chet.

530
00:37:58,733 --> 00:38:00,767
I can.

531
00:38:00,767 --> 00:38:03,467
- Does he know I'm here?
- Yeah.

532
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:05,267
And he wants you to
take me to him?

533
00:38:05,267 --> 00:38:07,867
Well, sure.
That's right.

534
00:38:07,867 --> 00:38:10,467
You're related to him.
You are, aren't you?

535
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,600
What's all the running
and the noise?

536
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,567
That's the grapevine.

537
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,700
There's a raid on.

538
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,433
They're warning everybody.
Come on in here.

539
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,333
It's me. Ippy.

540
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,100
Me know you're there,
Mr. Chester.

541
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:54,200
Police coming.
Me help you.

542
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,267
You know everything,
don't you, Ippy?

543
00:41:12,233 --> 00:41:15,200
- You see, I a friend of you.
- How did you know where I was?

544
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,867
Oh, big secret.
Ippy know all.

545
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:20,533
Works for anybody
that'll pay him.

546
00:41:20,533 --> 00:41:23,300
I wish to discuss
that part with you.

547
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,567
Pay?

548
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:26,600
I am businessman.

549
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,400
If I don't tell you police
coming, they take you.
Ippy gets nothing.

550
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,500
But there is someone who
will give big pay if I tell
where you are.

551
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,700
- Who?
- Tubby Otis.

552
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,933
One hundred dollars if I find
you, but for two hundred,
me no find you.

553
00:41:40,933 --> 00:41:43,867
You better collect the hundred
and I'll be waiting for him.

554
00:41:43,867 --> 00:41:45,867
Maybe he'll tell me who
he's working for.

555
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:47,433
You no pay?

556
00:41:47,433 --> 00:41:49,233
Not for anything you've
told me so far.

557
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:02,767
- Any sign of Chester up there?
- No, sarge.

558
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:08,433
Ippy have
other information.

559
00:42:08,433 --> 00:42:11,400
Relative of Mr. Chester
in Honolulu.

560
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,033
- I have no relatives.
- She stay big hotel.

561
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,533
Come to Half Acre.
Taxi dance. Look for you.

562
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:19,600
I told you
I have no relations.

563
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,333
She say she is.
She at dance hall...

564
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:23,900
Donna Williams.

565
00:42:25,633 --> 00:42:27,167
Williams?

566
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:29,867
I show. You see her soon
as policeman go away.

567
00:42:45,567 --> 00:42:47,967
She gone!
Dance hall closed!

568
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:51,033
- Ippy, you're a liar.
- No, I no lie.

569
00:42:51,033 --> 00:42:52,933
Well, if you're not, find her
and let me know where she is.

570
00:42:52,933 --> 00:42:55,033
Then you'll get your
two hundred dollars.

571
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:56,533
She relative?

572
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:58,567
Look, I've got no relatives.

573
00:42:58,567 --> 00:43:01,267
Say it again and I'll wring
that withered neck of yours.

574
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:09,467
Poor Mr. Chester.
No relatives.

575
00:43:33,133 --> 00:43:34,533
Fatso!

576
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:41,133
Hey, Tubby.
Wake up!

577
00:43:41,133 --> 00:43:43,667
You were in pretty bad
shape last night.

578
00:43:46,567 --> 00:43:49,267
Go on! You've slept long enough!

579
00:43:49,267 --> 00:43:50,267
Where is he?

580
00:43:50,267 --> 00:43:52,867
The man who...
I was drugged!

581
00:43:52,867 --> 00:43:54,500
There wasn't any man.

582
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,700
Tubby here found you outside the
Paradise Ballroom and he brought
you here.

583
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,700
It's a good thing he did.
Anything could have happened
to you.

584
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:05,633
Anything? Is this...
your place?

585
00:44:05,633 --> 00:44:09,300
If you mean am I married
to that, yeah.

586
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,767
- Go wash your face!
- Yeah.

587
00:44:13,933 --> 00:44:16,767
You know it's
already past noon?

588
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,067
You really got loaded
last night, girl.

589
00:44:19,067 --> 00:44:22,100
Well, how could I
drinking coffee?

590
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,333
Please, give me my clothes now.

591
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:27,367
Sure. Here you are.

592
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,767
- Where is she?
- Bedroom.

593
00:44:40,767 --> 00:44:42,167
Did you find Chester yet?

594
00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:45,000
I didn't see Ippy
anymore last night.

595
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,533
Ippy. Stay away from that guy.

596
00:44:47,533 --> 00:44:50,133
I never did trust him.
Use your other men.

597
00:44:50,133 --> 00:44:52,300
We must find Chester
before the cops do.

598
00:44:56,867 --> 00:44:58,433
Hi.

599
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:01,933
Don't leave her
alone in there.

600
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:03,367
Don't worry.
The window's locked.

601
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,700
Besides she's getting dressed.

602
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,333
She isn't about to
go anyplace.

603
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:08,533
- Where's Fatso?
- A little errand.

604
00:45:09,633 --> 00:45:12,000
- Your idea?
- Yeah.

605
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Beautiful girl.

606
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,200
- When are we going to cut out?
- Soon.

607
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,600
You keep saying that, but...

608
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,100
She might be the answer...

609
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,533
Unless she's a liar.

610
00:45:21,533 --> 00:45:24,867
She is a liar.
Chet has no relatives.
You know that.

611
00:45:24,867 --> 00:45:26,967
I don't know that
and neither do you.

612
00:46:31,967 --> 00:46:34,400
Now be nice!

613
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,100
Now why don't you be nice?
Then I won't hurt you.

614
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,100
I won't hurt you at all.

615
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:45,467
And the police department just announced

616
00:46:45,467 --> 00:46:47,267
That Chet Chester
is still at large.

617
00:46:48,867 --> 00:46:51,000
Last night's raid on Hell's
Half Acre netted nothing.

618
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,300
They suspect that he is...

619
00:47:02,267 --> 00:47:07,033
That's a nice girl.
That's it.

620
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:10,767
You know something?
You're pretty.

621
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:13,733
Yeah, very pretty.

622
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,900
Now...
now you can't scream any more.

623
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,067
Can't even talk.

624
00:47:31,567 --> 00:47:33,000
I like you.

625
00:47:38,733 --> 00:47:40,733
You even breathe pretty.

626
00:48:25,067 --> 00:48:28,567
Here. Drink this. It'll help.

627
00:48:36,733 --> 00:48:38,767
How'd you get in that
guy's room anyway?

628
00:48:38,767 --> 00:48:41,233
I wish I knew.

629
00:48:41,233 --> 00:48:43,567
I was drugged... or...

630
00:48:46,733 --> 00:48:47,867
Randy?

631
00:48:50,133 --> 00:48:51,633
Picture coming in clear now?

632
00:48:52,567 --> 00:48:54,500
Very clear.

633
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:57,433
It's all right.
I brought you here.

634
00:48:57,433 --> 00:48:59,600
Oh, I see.

635
00:49:03,033 --> 00:49:05,567
- Well?
- Well, what?

636
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:10,533
Aren't you going to say...
something?

637
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:13,367
Yes.

638
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:20,467
I'm not...
whoever you said.

639
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,667
My name is Chet Chester.

640
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:30,933
Ashamed?

641
00:49:30,933 --> 00:49:34,967
- Ashamed of what?
- Your past.

642
00:49:34,967 --> 00:49:39,233
- What's wrong with it?
- You tell me.

643
00:49:39,933 --> 00:49:41,867
You wouldn't be interested.

644
00:49:41,867 --> 00:49:46,067
- Uh, cream and sugar?
- Sugar.

645
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:48,767
No, you got the wrong boy.
Take my word for it.

646
00:49:48,767 --> 00:49:50,867
Why should I?

647
00:49:50,867 --> 00:49:52,867
I guess you got no
other choice.

648
00:49:54,733 --> 00:49:57,067
And I imagined it
quite differently.

649
00:49:57,067 --> 00:50:00,367
- What?
- Our meeting.

650
00:50:01,633 --> 00:50:04,933
The way it would be
after all this time.

651
00:50:04,933 --> 00:50:07,867
What'd you expect I'd do?

652
00:50:07,867 --> 00:50:10,633
Run into your arms and tell you
I'm the guy you're looking
for?

653
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,733
Yes.

654
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:18,500
I'm sorry to
disappoint you, girl.

655
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,733
I'm not it.

656
00:50:21,367 --> 00:50:23,500
Then why did you
bring me here?'

657
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,300
'Cause I can't stand
to hear a woman scream.

658
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:32,067
Thank you very much.

659
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:36,467
Well, I'm all right now.
I'd better be going.

660
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:39,733
- Yeah, but...
- What?

661
00:50:39,733 --> 00:50:42,700
Well, it's not safe. It's a
pretty tough neighborhood.

662
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,433
I sent for a friend of mine
to take you home.

663
00:50:46,433 --> 00:50:48,133
That's very thoughtful of you.

664
00:50:48,133 --> 00:50:50,967
It'll be a few minutes
before he gets here, so you
might as well relax.

665
00:50:54,767 --> 00:50:56,733
Look, when you get out of here,

666
00:50:56,733 --> 00:51:01,133
Take my advice and
grab the first plane back
to wherever you come from,

667
00:51:01,133 --> 00:51:03,567
Back to that castle
of dreams of yours.

668
00:51:04,633 --> 00:51:06,500
Don't mess around other
people's dirty laundry.

669
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:13,867
Tell me about this, uh, Randy?

670
00:51:13,867 --> 00:51:16,267
He must've been
quite a character

671
00:51:16,267 --> 00:51:19,333
To send you half way across
the world looking for him.

672
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:21,400
Who is he?

673
00:51:23,767 --> 00:51:26,167
My husband of three days.

674
00:51:27,933 --> 00:51:29,933
That wouldn't be too
hard to take.

675
00:51:31,467 --> 00:51:33,133
Why don't you sit down?

676
00:51:37,267 --> 00:51:38,767
Where'd he come from?

677
00:51:38,767 --> 00:51:41,400
- A small town in Arizona.
- Yeah?

678
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,467
Nice family.

679
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:48,867
Randy had a kid sister, too.
Only she's not a kid anymore.

680
00:51:48,867 --> 00:51:50,867
She was married
a few weeks ago.

681
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:53,933
Good for her.

682
00:51:54,867 --> 00:51:57,167
Now, shall we change
the subject?

683
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,467
Or is there something else?

684
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:06,067
Yes, there is.
A son, my son.

685
00:52:10,667 --> 00:52:12,600
He's eleven years old.

686
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,300
That would...

687
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,900
That would...

688
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,500
Make him the father
of the child.

689
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,467
How did you know how long ago
I was married to Randy?

690
00:52:26,467 --> 00:52:27,867
I didn't.

691
00:52:27,867 --> 00:52:30,133
The way you talk it sounded like
it was quite a while ago.

692
00:52:30,133 --> 00:52:33,667
Yes, before the war.
And he was the father.

693
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:37,667
Only he never saw
the boy... never knew.

694
00:52:39,067 --> 00:52:41,267
I christened him Randy.

695
00:52:42,533 --> 00:52:46,233
He looks just like... him.

696
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,600
Does that mean
anything to you?

697
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,100
No. Why should it?

698
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,200
He's in a military school.

699
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,767
He's very bright
and quite manly.

700
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,033
Anybody would be proud of him.

701
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,500
And he's...
he's crazy about sports.

702
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,100
He made the baseball team.

703
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,233
I saw him play the other day.

704
00:53:12,233 --> 00:53:16,867
He got himself a homerun...
with the bases loaded.

705
00:53:19,467 --> 00:53:20,867
Yeah?

706
00:53:34,867 --> 00:53:36,400
Me got it for you.

707
00:53:37,233 --> 00:53:38,467
Did you open it?

708
00:53:38,467 --> 00:53:42,433
Oh, no. Ippy not open.
Ippy not see key inside.

709
00:53:42,433 --> 00:53:44,733
You wouldn't know what
the key was for anyway.

710
00:53:44,733 --> 00:53:48,000
No. Me ponder,
but me not know.

711
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,300
I bring number one man.
He waiting for you.

712
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,900
Come on.
You're going home.

713
00:54:15,033 --> 00:54:19,300
Mr. Chester not poor now,
has relative.

714
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:28,867
- Chief Dan!
- Hello, Dan.

715
00:54:28,867 --> 00:54:31,400
Good evening.
I can't believe it.

716
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,667
We've raided this place, combed
it from one end to the other,

717
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:36,533
And you were here
all the time.

718
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:39,067
You have to come with me.

719
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,533
I know, Dan. But do me
a favor first?

720
00:54:41,533 --> 00:54:43,333
That's why I sent for you.

721
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:45,033
What is it?

722
00:54:45,033 --> 00:54:48,867
Get Mrs. Williams back to her
hotel and onto a plane to the
mainland.

723
00:54:48,867 --> 00:54:51,067
Before whoever killed Sally
comes back after her.

724
00:54:51,067 --> 00:54:54,767
Jamison can attend to that.
My job is to take you in.

725
00:54:54,767 --> 00:54:57,767
Look, Dan, I didn't escape
for my freedom.

726
00:54:57,767 --> 00:54:59,233
- I wanted to get the...
- I know that.

727
00:54:59,233 --> 00:55:02,033
But now you're going to have
to leave that up to us.

728
00:55:02,033 --> 00:55:04,000
Give me a chance... just a
couple of hours

729
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,200
While you're getting
Mrs. Williams squared away.

730
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,633
I think I can do it.

731
00:55:07,633 --> 00:55:09,167
Everybody in the Acre's
helping me.

732
00:55:09,167 --> 00:55:12,967
If my lead is right, why they'll
find him and bring him to me.

733
00:55:12,967 --> 00:55:16,533
Look, Dan, put me in that room
with Jamie, or a squad of cops.

734
00:55:16,533 --> 00:55:18,867
I'll be under wraps, handcuffed.

735
00:55:18,867 --> 00:55:20,867
When the killer comes in,
Jamie can grab him.

736
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:28,867
OK, two hours.

737
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,300
Thanks.

738
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:33,400
Let's hope we can get this
job finished tonight.

739
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,967
Too bad your job can't
be finished.

740
00:55:35,967 --> 00:55:37,867
Can't it?

741
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:41,733
Here in Hawaii,
memories of times gone by
are two for a quarter.

742
00:55:43,467 --> 00:55:44,933
Come on, Jamie.

743
00:55:44,933 --> 00:55:47,533
- No funny stuff this time.
- All right. I'll be good.

744
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:07,433
The most important thing to
the man at the dance hall

745
00:56:07,433 --> 00:56:10,433
Was to discover what your
relationship is to Chet,
isn't it?

746
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:12,867
Yes. Uh-huh.

747
00:56:12,867 --> 00:56:17,433
Then, if he were to believe
that you are Chet's wife,

748
00:56:17,433 --> 00:56:19,700
Chet wouldn't
even have to look for him.

749
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:23,500
He'd come voluntarily.
We could trap him.

750
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,100
What are you driving at?

751
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,267
Oh, nothing.
I was just making like a cop.

752
00:56:28,267 --> 00:56:29,567
It gets to be a habit.

753
00:56:57,233 --> 00:56:58,900
What are you doing?

754
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,133
I knew you weren't going
to leave me, Ja...

755
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:21,633
What are you doing back here?
You changed your clothes.

756
00:57:21,633 --> 00:57:23,767
Why didn't Dan put you
on the plane?

757
00:57:23,767 --> 00:57:26,333
Because my place is with you.
I'm your wife.

758
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:29,500
Make believe wife, that is.

759
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,300
Look, this is no time
to play house.

760
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,033
Where is Dan?
What's this all about?

761
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:37,200
I'm going to be part of your
plan to catch the man that
killed Sally Lee.

762
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,567
Chief Dan says that if the
murderer thinks I'm your wife,

763
00:57:40,567 --> 00:57:43,700
He's more certain to come
after me than he is after you.

764
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,200
- You see, I saw him.
- What?

765
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,333
Yes. About the time
Sally Lee was killed.

766
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:49,333
Where?

767
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:50,867
At your house, on the beach.

768
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,367
Who was he?
What does he look like?

769
00:57:52,367 --> 00:57:55,467
- He was an oriental.
- Chinese?

770
00:57:55,467 --> 00:57:59,200
I think so.
I can't be certain.

771
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,567
What can you be certain of?

772
00:58:00,567 --> 00:58:02,333
Are you sure you'd recognize
him if you saw him again?

773
00:58:02,333 --> 00:58:04,000
Yes. I would.

774
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:08,500
How did you get
mixed up in this?

775
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,533
Tangled up with murder,

776
00:58:09,533 --> 00:58:12,467
With people you've never
even heard of.

777
00:58:12,467 --> 00:58:14,300
And now the police are
using you in a stakeout...

778
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:17,067
A target for somebody's
shooting practice.

779
00:58:17,067 --> 00:58:18,267
Who's going to protect you?

780
00:58:18,267 --> 00:58:20,700
The whole area will be
filled with detectives.

781
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,667
Oh, they won't even get
past the grapevine.

782
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:24,967
Look. Some already have.
And there are more to come.

783
00:58:24,967 --> 00:58:27,667
They came in plain clothes.
Take a look.

784
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,633
Did Dan talk you into this?

785
00:58:42,633 --> 00:58:47,067
It was his idea,
but I talked him into it.

786
00:59:20,367 --> 00:59:23,500
How's anybody going to get
this idiotic story of yours,

787
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:26,000
About your being my
so-called wife?

788
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,333
What are we supposed to do,

789
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:29,167
Stand on a rooftop and
shout it to the world?

790
00:59:29,167 --> 00:59:32,400
It's going to be on
the 9:00 news broadcast

791
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,933
And that, uh, that Mr. Ippy
is going to sell the information
to Tubby Otis.

792
00:59:37,933 --> 00:59:40,267
Chief Dan arranged that, too.

793
00:59:40,267 --> 00:59:43,000
Why are you doing this?
It's crazy.

794
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,400
I thought I'd help
as long as I'm here.

795
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:49,067
Look, I don't want your help.
I don't want it.

796
00:59:49,067 --> 00:59:51,367
I don't need it.
I'm not buying it.

797
00:59:51,367 --> 00:59:53,600
This time you
have no choice.

798
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,867
- I don't?
- No!

799
00:59:55,867 --> 00:59:59,133
Because I've decided
to stick around a little longer.

800
00:59:59,133 --> 01:00:04,067
I don't believe you...
that story about Chet Chester.

801
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:06,233
You're going to have to be
a little more convincing.

802
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,100
It's 24 minutes before 9:00.

803
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,267
That gives you
24 minutes.

804
01:00:12,267 --> 01:00:14,267
To do what?

805
01:00:14,267 --> 01:00:16,533
To tell you the life story
of Chester?

806
01:00:18,367 --> 01:00:21,267
All right,
if that's what you want.

807
01:00:22,767 --> 01:00:24,167
Let me see now.

808
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:28,000
It was a bed of roses
all the way.

809
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,100
What? You want more?

810
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,600
Yes.

811
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,500
When did you come
to the Islands?

812
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,667
When?

813
01:00:36,667 --> 01:00:38,433
When I was a
little boy in knee pants,

814
01:00:38,433 --> 01:00:41,533
And I've lived here ever since
like a happy, little beachboy.

815
01:00:42,967 --> 01:00:45,333
I told you, Roger!

816
01:00:53,133 --> 01:00:55,333
That's enough, Roger!
That's enough!

817
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:57,600
Dirty stupid slob!

818
01:01:23,633 --> 01:01:27,200
Well, now that we're on a story
telling jag, what about your
story?

819
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,967
What's the difference?

820
01:01:28,967 --> 01:01:32,600
- Are you ashamed?
- No!

821
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,167
Well, come on.
Let's hear it.

822
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:36,967
The life and loves
of Donna Williams.

823
01:01:36,967 --> 01:01:38,867
- Loves?
- Yeah, make it good.

824
01:01:38,867 --> 01:01:41,867
There's nothing I like better
than a good, corny love story.

825
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,333
Did you ever hear the one
about the little girl...

826
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:48,867
Seventeen?

827
01:01:48,867 --> 01:01:53,867
Silly, wide-eyed, met a
sailor boy just before the war.

828
01:01:53,867 --> 01:01:55,900
Fell crazy in love with him.

829
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,400
He and the girl went
everywhere together,

830
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,267
The beach, the show, riding the
rollercoaster, dancing.

831
01:02:03,267 --> 01:02:05,933
The world was young
and so were they.

832
01:02:05,933 --> 01:02:08,167
Nothing was ever
going to hurt them.

833
01:02:08,167 --> 01:02:09,433
Nothing.

834
01:02:10,267 --> 01:02:11,667
Corny enough for you?

835
01:02:11,667 --> 01:02:12,867
Oh, you're doing fine.

836
01:02:12,867 --> 01:02:14,633
Oh, wait until
you hear the rest.

837
01:02:14,633 --> 01:02:18,567
They ran off to Tijuana
and got married.

838
01:02:18,567 --> 01:02:21,400
They had a mad,
lovely honeymoon.

839
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,867
He bought her a sombrero,

840
01:02:23,867 --> 01:02:28,600
And a little painted
turtle, named Ichabod.

841
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:31,967
Then, oh get this wild finish,

842
01:02:31,967 --> 01:02:35,300
Just when they celebrated
their third anniversary,

843
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:38,067
The third day that is,

844
01:02:38,067 --> 01:02:40,367
He went away.

845
01:02:40,367 --> 01:02:43,900
- A real rat.
- No. He had to go.

846
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,700
His ship was sailing.

847
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:49,967
The next the girl heard
about was Pearl Harbor.

848
01:02:49,967 --> 01:02:53,233
He was missing in action.

849
01:02:53,233 --> 01:02:55,333
She couldn't believe it...

850
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:58,167
For a long, long time.

851
01:02:58,167 --> 01:03:02,933
She had a wild idea in her head
that somehow he'd escaped,

852
01:03:02,933 --> 01:03:06,000
And maybe he couldn't
come back because...

853
01:03:08,033 --> 01:03:10,600
Because he was burned
out of his mind.

854
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,333
Is that what you mean?

855
01:03:16,867 --> 01:03:20,100
What about the climax scene?
What about the boy?

856
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:23,133
Who believes his father
died a hero.

857
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:25,333
Yeah.

858
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:27,867
When you tell the story,
don't leave that out.

859
01:03:27,867 --> 01:03:29,600
That's the best part.

860
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,067
It's not a very
happy story, is it?

861
01:03:44,933 --> 01:03:46,700
All right, Ippy. Go ahead.

862
01:04:06,567 --> 01:04:08,367
- It's Ippy.

863
01:04:08,367 --> 01:04:10,633
Ippy.

864
01:04:10,633 --> 01:04:13,000
- Invite him in.
- He can't see you here.

865
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,233
Shut up.
I'll handle it.

866
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:19,467
Mr. Kong!

867
01:04:19,467 --> 01:04:21,133
What are you...

868
01:04:21,133 --> 01:04:24,367
Do you want to broadcast
my name all over the Acre?

869
01:04:24,367 --> 01:04:26,733
What you doing here,
Mr. Kong?

870
01:04:26,733 --> 01:04:28,433
Who told you to come here?

871
01:04:28,433 --> 01:04:31,400
Have news. Good news.

872
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,867
Who are you working for?

873
01:04:32,867 --> 01:04:36,867
Tubby. And you.
Ippy big friend of you.

874
01:04:36,867 --> 01:04:38,400
What's the news?

875
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,067
Well, ordinarily it cost lot
of money, but not to you.

876
01:04:42,067 --> 01:04:45,533
- It's free.
- Free information?

877
01:04:45,533 --> 01:04:47,900
Chet Chester has
Donna Williams with him.

878
01:04:49,867 --> 01:04:51,033
Where?

879
01:04:51,033 --> 01:04:53,533
They in court four balcony, room 47.

880
01:04:53,533 --> 01:04:57,400
- She his wife.
- Is this a police trap?

881
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,467
Are you working for the cops?

882
01:04:59,467 --> 01:05:02,200
They sent you here,
didn't they?

883
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,867
No. Ippy good friend of you.

884
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:08,433
Nobody send. Me saw.
Girl wife of him.

885
01:05:08,433 --> 01:05:11,433
Me telling truth.
Ippy go now, please!

886
01:05:11,433 --> 01:05:12,867
You're not going anywhere.

887
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:16,000
You puny, double-crossing
little creep!

888
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:21,000
Me telling truth.
Me go! Please!

889
01:05:29,433 --> 01:05:31,133
Mrs. Chet Chester who flew in

890
01:05:31,133 --> 01:05:33,900
From the mainland has
disappeared from her hotel.

891
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:36,233
It is reliably reported that
she has made contact

892
01:05:36,233 --> 01:05:39,700
With her fugitive husband, who
yesterday escaped the police.

893
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:43,067
Mrs. Chester is believed to be
in hiding with Chet Chester
this very moment.

894
01:05:43,067 --> 01:05:44,100
However...

895
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,767
He was telling the truth.

896
01:05:45,767 --> 01:05:48,067
Maybe for the first time,
and he died for it.

897
01:05:48,067 --> 01:05:51,733
Shut up!
So she is his wife.

898
01:05:51,733 --> 01:05:54,667
What about it?
What's the difference now?

899
01:05:54,667 --> 01:05:56,767
The difference is she's right
here in the Acre.

900
01:05:56,767 --> 01:05:59,000
She's made herself
a fugitive just like him.

901
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,667
She's right here within reach.

902
01:06:00,667 --> 01:06:03,433
- Well, what do you want to do?
- It's your fault!

903
01:06:03,433 --> 01:06:04,867
What are you trying to do?

904
01:06:04,867 --> 01:06:07,033
You've got two murders
on your hands already.

905
01:06:07,033 --> 01:06:08,167
Do you want to make it three?

906
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:14,533
A million dollars.
It's all gone now.

907
01:06:14,533 --> 01:06:15,867
But it's a lot worse.

908
01:06:15,867 --> 01:06:18,400
Now it's my neck.
We must get her.

909
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,733
She and Chet both,
before the cops do.

910
01:06:27,867 --> 01:06:29,767
Why doesn't Ippy come out?

911
01:06:29,767 --> 01:06:31,500
- There may be another door.
- Well, let's...

912
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,867
Let's go and break
in right now.

913
01:06:32,867 --> 01:06:34,233
No, no. Wait.

914
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,133
Still can't see a thing.

915
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,133
Use the back door
just the same.

916
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,167
If this works, he...

917
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:39,967
Or they ought to be
along any minute.

918
01:07:39,967 --> 01:07:43,867
- What time is it?
- 9:07.

919
01:07:43,867 --> 01:07:46,733
I hope the police are ready.

920
01:07:46,733 --> 01:07:48,867
Sorry you got into
this now, aren't you?

921
01:08:41,533 --> 01:08:44,233
It was a trap!
Dirty rat!

922
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:37,933
Thanks anyway for giving
the stake out a trial, Dan.

923
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:40,300
All we caught was Tubby Otis.

924
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:41,500
What about his wife?

925
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:43,833
She got away along with somebody
who was with her.

926
01:10:43,833 --> 01:10:49,000
And Ippy's in the emergency
hospital, half-dead, broken
neck.

927
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,467
Where's Mrs. Williams?

928
01:10:51,467 --> 01:10:54,300
There are no planes leaving for
the Mainland until the morning.

929
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,300
She needed protection
for the night,

930
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:59,667
So I thought it best that
she stay at your
beach house.

931
01:10:59,667 --> 01:11:01,167
Alone?

932
01:11:01,167 --> 01:11:05,467
So, I... I practically blew
my cork worrying about you.

933
01:11:05,467 --> 01:11:09,733
I didn't know whether to get
ready for a funeral or wedding.

934
01:11:09,733 --> 01:11:14,100
A lot of good I did him.
He's on his way back to prison.

935
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,233
Is it the end of the line
for him?

936
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,233
I guess so.

937
01:11:21,233 --> 01:11:24,000
You feel pretty bad, don't you?

938
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,633
- Rotten.
- Because of her?

939
01:11:27,633 --> 01:11:29,300
Yeah.

940
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:33,033
- She must be in love with you.
- Oh, that's crazy.

941
01:11:33,033 --> 01:11:36,567
She's got some silly romantic
idea that I'm somebody else.

942
01:11:36,567 --> 01:11:38,933
Chet, it should be obvious
even to a blind man that

943
01:11:38,933 --> 01:11:41,200
Donna's not just going away
and forget you,

944
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,867
Whatever your name is.

945
01:11:42,867 --> 01:11:44,300
Then someone has to
make her do it.

946
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,467
Calling car one.

947
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,100
This is car one. Come in.

948
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,733
Chief, Ippy died
at the hospital.

949
01:11:51,733 --> 01:11:55,333
Oh. Then you weren't able
to get him to talk.

950
01:11:55,333 --> 01:11:58,533
No. Only a couple of
mumbled words.

951
01:11:58,533 --> 01:12:00,300
It was all garbled up.

952
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:04,567
Sounded something like
Konrog... Rog...

953
01:12:04,567 --> 01:12:05,733
Something like that.

954
01:12:05,733 --> 01:12:07,367
Thank you.

955
01:12:07,367 --> 01:12:09,767
Kong... Rog...

956
01:12:09,767 --> 01:12:11,933
Are you trying to say
Roger Kong?

957
01:12:25,667 --> 01:12:26,867
Turn left at the next street!

958
01:12:26,867 --> 01:12:28,500
Chet, quit kidding with me.

959
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,667
Now, do what I tell you.
Take the next left.

960
01:12:30,667 --> 01:12:32,033
You're being very foolish.

961
01:12:32,033 --> 01:12:33,633
Just how far do you
think you'll get?

962
01:12:33,633 --> 01:12:34,633
By the time you get
to a telephone,

963
01:12:34,633 --> 01:12:37,067
I'll be as far as
I want to go.

964
01:12:37,067 --> 01:12:39,200
- Now stop the car.
- No, Chet!

965
01:13:00,333 --> 01:13:02,000
Yes, chief?

966
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,867
Get me the Hawaiian Retreat.

967
01:13:03,867 --> 01:13:05,033
Yes, sir.

968
01:13:07,533 --> 01:13:09,433
Hawaiian Retreat.

969
01:13:09,433 --> 01:13:10,700
Go ahead, chief.

970
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,467
Is Roger Kong there?

971
01:13:12,467 --> 01:13:16,500
Yes, sir. Mr. Kong has
been here quite some time,

972
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,933
Since 7:30.

973
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,333
Thank you.

974
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,500
A call just came in,
either from the chief
or someone in his office.

975
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,900
Did you tell him that we had
been here ever since 7:30?

976
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:35,733
- Sure I did.
- That's good.

977
01:13:36,733 --> 01:13:38,900
- What was that?
- It worked.

978
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:41,700
At least we have an alibi
just in case somebody

979
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,367
Thought they recognized us
running out of the Acre.

980
01:14:43,467 --> 01:14:45,567
- I thought you were...
- Behind bars?

981
01:14:48,633 --> 01:14:51,133
What are you writing?
Your memoirs?

982
01:14:51,133 --> 01:14:55,633
- No. Just a letter.
- Fine.

983
01:14:55,633 --> 01:14:59,233
I've been writing too, a new
finish to that story of yours.

984
01:14:59,233 --> 01:15:00,867
You see, the little girl
comes to the Islands.

985
01:15:00,867 --> 01:15:03,600
She thinks her sailor boy
is still alive.

986
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,700
She even thinks she sees him.

987
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:07,967
She's wrong.
All wrong.

988
01:15:07,967 --> 01:15:10,433
Her sailor boy is dead.

989
01:15:10,433 --> 01:15:12,400
Nothing... and no one
will bring him back.

990
01:15:13,333 --> 01:15:14,867
Now let the dead rest!

991
01:15:15,533 --> 01:15:17,000
Stop walking on a grave.

992
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,267
Fine writing.

993
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:24,133
And while you're at it, why not
finish the letter for me?

994
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:27,300
It's to our son.

995
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,600
You didn't fool me.

996
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,100
Maybe for a few minutes
in the beginning.

997
01:15:35,867 --> 01:15:37,267
But that's all.

998
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:45,200
What do you want me to do?
Tell him the truth?

999
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,500
Tell him his father
didn't die a hero?

1000
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,600
Wasn't a hero at all?

1001
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,267
A deserter, a thief, a cheat?

1002
01:15:52,267 --> 01:15:54,867
A man who will probably rot out
the rest of his life in prison.

1003
01:15:56,133 --> 01:15:57,867
Is that what you want
me to tell him?

1004
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:02,000
No, his father's dead.

1005
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,267
He died the day Chet Chester
started to live,

1006
01:16:06,267 --> 01:16:08,867
And Chet Chester will
stay here in the Islands.

1007
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:12,467
In the paradise he found?

1008
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:15,567
The paradise he stole.

1009
01:16:19,167 --> 01:16:23,033
Now the story's really finished.
Close the book and put it away.

1010
01:16:23,033 --> 01:16:25,067
Never was a very good
book anyway.

1011
01:16:25,067 --> 01:16:26,600
It wasn't even worth
your plane fare.

1012
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:33,600
I still wish there was...
some solution, some way.

1013
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,667
Donna, what ever happened
to that turtle?

1014
01:16:36,667 --> 01:16:39,033
That Ichabod?

1015
01:16:39,033 --> 01:16:43,100
I let him swim in the
fishpond one day.
He disappeared.

1016
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:46,200
I think he hid under one of
the water lilies.

1017
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:49,333
There were so many lilies,
I couldn't find him.

1018
01:16:49,333 --> 01:16:51,900
Then you come out
from under yours.

1019
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:53,867
Randy, I think you're under
the impression

1020
01:16:53,867 --> 01:16:57,500
I've been living in an ivory
tower all these years.

1021
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,167
I haven't.

1022
01:16:59,167 --> 01:17:02,100
- Is he good to you?
- Very.

1023
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:04,700
Then you get back there
and marry him.

1024
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:07,967
It'll be your first marriage.

1025
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:10,333
You know, three days doesn't
make a marriage.

1026
01:17:10,333 --> 01:17:13,867
- Our boy does.
- Then give him a break.

1027
01:17:13,867 --> 01:17:16,433
Give him a father
he can be proud of.

1028
01:17:16,433 --> 01:17:20,033
Give him a man in the house that
he can look up to and respect.

1029
01:17:20,033 --> 01:17:23,767
Don't smother him with memories
of a man that doesn't exist.

1030
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,267
It's too late to count
our regrets.

1031
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:35,233
Wait.

1032
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,067
I'd like to kiss you goodbye.

1033
01:17:53,233 --> 01:17:57,467
You were wrong.
It was worth the plane fare.

1034
01:18:11,433 --> 01:18:14,033
- Get the waiter.
- I told you you've had enough.

1035
01:18:14,033 --> 01:18:16,400
No, one more.

1036
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,200
Just one more.
I'm celebrating.

1037
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:24,367
- A fish wife no more.
- Quiet down.

1038
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:29,333
Oh, my poor slob of a husband.
Bang, bang, bang.

1039
01:18:29,333 --> 01:18:32,133
I'll bet he has more holes
in him than a sieve.

1040
01:18:32,133 --> 01:18:33,400
Knock it off.

1041
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,467
Dead! With a million bullet
holes in him.

1042
01:18:38,467 --> 01:18:39,867
Hello, Harry.

1043
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,933
Chet! What are you doing here?
Somebody will see you!

1044
01:18:43,933 --> 01:18:45,867
- The police just called.
- No, that was me.

1045
01:18:45,867 --> 01:18:50,633
I was just checking up to see if
Roger had used the old perfect
alibi routine.

1046
01:18:50,633 --> 01:18:51,933
I was sure he would.

1047
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:56,367
- Come on and dance with me.
- All right.

1048
01:18:56,367 --> 01:18:59,967
No more drinking, or you won't
be able to get out of that
chair.

1049
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:43,333
- The place is emptying out.
- It must be closing time.

1050
01:19:43,333 --> 01:19:45,733
Why don't you go pay the check?
I'll go powder my nose.

1051
01:19:47,233 --> 01:19:48,467
Waiter?

1052
01:20:10,433 --> 01:20:12,033
Hey, what is this?

1053
01:20:12,033 --> 01:20:16,100
Hey, let me out of here!
What's the idea?

1054
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:18,933
- Waiting for your check?
- Yes, I am.

1055
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:23,800
Chet! What are you doing here?

1056
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,800
The police will spot you!

1057
01:20:27,067 --> 01:20:28,100
I've got to get going.

1058
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:30,367
Running out on an old friend?

1059
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,033
And I always thought you were
one of my best friends.

1060
01:20:35,033 --> 01:20:37,000
Sure, I am.

1061
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,767
You and Sally and I...

1062
01:20:39,767 --> 01:20:41,867
Went a lot of places
over the years.

1063
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:47,467
- Didn't we, Roger?
- Yeah. Yeah, a lot of places.

1064
01:20:48,067 --> 01:20:50,533
But... so what?

1065
01:20:52,133 --> 01:20:55,200
You always said if there was any
favor I wanted, you'd do it.

1066
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:02,467
Sure. Go ahead. Name it.
What is it you want?

1067
01:21:04,033 --> 01:21:07,067
Tell me about those people who
were killed tonight in Hell's
Half Acre.

1068
01:21:07,067 --> 01:21:11,267
What makes you think I
know anything about it?

1069
01:21:11,267 --> 01:21:13,333
I haven't been anywhere
near the Acre.

1070
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:15,067
I've been right here
ever since...

1071
01:21:15,067 --> 01:21:17,033
Ever since seven thirty.
I know.

1072
01:21:17,033 --> 01:21:21,900
Yeah. That's right.
And I can prove it.

1073
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:25,633
You forget.
I invented the alibi.

1074
01:21:29,333 --> 01:21:31,867
So that makes you the only one
who knows about it.

1075
01:22:06,533 --> 01:22:08,633
Now sit down
and be a good boy.

1076
01:22:10,667 --> 01:22:13,367
Harry, bring that pen
I asked you for.

1077
01:22:15,133 --> 01:22:18,967
I have something here in the
nature of a legal document.

1078
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:21,100
It only needs my signature
for a punch line.

1079
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,433
What is it?
What are you talking about?

1080
01:22:23,433 --> 01:22:26,967
To Randy Williams, Junior,
I leave all my real and
personal property.

1081
01:22:26,967 --> 01:22:29,633
You make it sound like your
last will and testament.

1082
01:22:29,633 --> 01:22:31,867
Ah, you're a real smart boy,
Roger.

1083
01:22:31,867 --> 01:22:33,067
That's exactly that it is.

1084
01:22:33,067 --> 01:22:35,567
The documents and cash
to be found

1085
01:22:35,567 --> 01:22:38,333
In my vault at the First
National Bank of Honolulu.

1086
01:22:40,567 --> 01:22:42,233
That's what you wanted to know,
isn't it, Roger?

1087
01:22:42,233 --> 01:22:43,633
I don't know what you're
talking about.

1088
01:22:43,633 --> 01:22:45,100
Sally had to die because she
wouldn't tell you where it
was.

1089
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:46,367
You're crazy! I never...

1090
01:22:46,367 --> 01:22:47,367
You killed her!

1091
01:22:47,367 --> 01:22:49,233
You wanted to see me rot in jail

1092
01:22:49,233 --> 01:22:51,300
Just so you could get your
hands on my money.

1093
01:22:51,867 --> 01:22:54,333
Here, I'll help you.

1094
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:56,167
This is the key to my vault...

1095
01:22:56,167 --> 01:22:59,267
The key you didn't even
need because it's the same vault
we had when we were partners.

1096
01:22:59,267 --> 01:23:02,267
And you still have authorization
to go into it at any time.

1097
01:23:02,267 --> 01:23:05,233
So you see? The money
wasn't hidden after all.

1098
01:23:05,233 --> 01:23:07,200
Yet you killed.
Three people had to die

1099
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,400
While you were trying
to find it.

1100
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,867
Sally stumbled and fell.
It was an accident.

1101
01:23:10,867 --> 01:23:16,067
What about Ippy's broken neck?
Was that an accident?

1102
01:23:16,067 --> 01:23:17,333
I've got an errand for you.

1103
01:23:18,367 --> 01:23:21,867
The favor I wanted you to do
as an old friend.

1104
01:23:21,867 --> 01:23:23,967
Deliver that to Donna
Williams at my house.

1105
01:23:27,133 --> 01:23:28,867
Don't forget your gun, Roger.

1106
01:23:46,267 --> 01:23:50,567
You forget I still have the
authorization at the
bank.

1107
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:52,633
That'll be stopped
in the morning.

1108
01:23:52,633 --> 01:23:54,867
You won't stop anything.

1109
01:23:54,867 --> 01:23:59,000
You won't tell anybody about
Sally or the key or anything
else.

1110
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,267
In front of witnesses?

1111
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:12,567
Well?

1112
01:24:13,867 --> 01:24:15,567
You won't get far.

1113
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:32,367
- He got away?
- Not quite.

1114
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:35,033
He's waiting for me outside.

1115
01:24:43,867 --> 01:24:46,067
Five-one-nine-one-one.

1116
01:24:50,533 --> 01:24:53,700
Hello, Dan?
I'm glad you're back.

1117
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:55,767
I'm sorry, Dan. I had to.

1118
01:24:55,767 --> 01:24:58,167
Now wait a minute.
Now listen, Dan.

1119
01:24:58,167 --> 01:24:59,900
Listen, this is important.

1120
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:01,467
Have some of your men
move into the area,

1121
01:25:01,467 --> 01:25:03,533
Surrounding the Retreat
right away.

1122
01:25:03,533 --> 01:25:05,367
The Hawaiian Retreat.

1123
01:25:05,367 --> 01:25:06,967
Make sure they're unnoticed.

1124
01:25:06,967 --> 01:25:09,700
Now when they hear a shot,
and they nail the guy

1125
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:12,100
Who fired it, they'll have the
murderer of Sally and Ippy.

1126
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:15,600
And Dan, just in case you
have trouble proving he murdered
Sally and Ippy,

1127
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,433
You may be able to charge him
with another murder.

1128
01:25:17,433 --> 01:25:18,467
Whose?

1129
01:25:18,467 --> 01:25:20,300
Mine.

1130
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:23,267
Chet, don't be a fool!

1131
01:25:23,267 --> 01:25:25,033
Chet! Chet!

1132
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:42,633
Harry, fix me a nightcap,
will you?

1133
01:25:42,633 --> 01:25:45,933
- The usual?
- Yeah.

1134
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:21,267
I always said you mixed the best
drinks in the Islands, Harry.

1135
01:27:29,867 --> 01:27:31,500
What was that?

1136
01:29:09,033 --> 01:29:11,567
- Chief!
- Good afternoon.

1137
01:29:11,567 --> 01:29:13,867
I see you're ready to leave.

1138
01:29:13,867 --> 01:29:15,967
I understand you have
everything arranged.

1139
01:29:15,967 --> 01:29:17,700
Yes, I have.

1140
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:23,067
Well, I was in the neighborhood
so I thought I'd stop by for a
farewell aloha.

1141
01:29:23,067 --> 01:29:24,767
That's very kind of you.

1142
01:29:24,767 --> 01:29:28,367
Your call is ready from the mainland.

1143
01:29:28,367 --> 01:29:29,400
Excuse me.

1144
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:32,000
- Oh, Mrs. Williams?
- Yes?

1145
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,533
Eh, by any chance are you going
to speak to your uh... little
boy?

1146
01:29:36,533 --> 01:29:38,700
- Yes, I am.
- Well, good.

1147
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:44,433
Then why don't you tell him that
the original Navy records were
correct?

1148
01:29:44,433 --> 01:29:48,167
His father... his father
died at Pearl Harbor.

1149
01:29:50,433 --> 01:29:54,000
Thank you, chief.
Thank you very much.

1150
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:03,933
Hello, Frank?
Is little Randy with you?

1151
01:30:03,933 --> 01:30:05,067
Good.

1152
01:30:05,067 --> 01:30:08,867
Hello, sweetheart.

1153
01:30:08,867 --> 01:30:14,133
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1154
01:30:14,133 --> 01:30:15,333
Yes, darling.

1155
01:30:15,333 --> 01:30:17,067
Mommy's coming home.
