1
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,752
Truck looks great.
Must be a fortune here.

2
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,559
I know, just not in front of him, OK?

3
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,950
Fellas, what's going on?
I've been here too long.

4
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,918
- Give us a minute.
- No. Check this out.

5
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,878
You can't get no cleaner. These are
very popular with the children.

6
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,111
This is a federal tax stamp.
You can't get no cleaner.

7
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,953
You keep 'em
if it's such a great deal.

8
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,794
I ain't from Detroit. I don't know
nobody who can handle a job this big.

9
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,634
You're supposed to have the
connections. Do what you want to do.

10
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,157
- It ain't easy to get rid of this.
- I know, but I'm a businessman.

11
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,596
Warm up the truck.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

12
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,716
- Here you go.
- You're a sharp kid.

13
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,552
Thank you.

14
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,997
Cousin, my man, don't dash yet.
This looks like $2,000, not $5,000.

15
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,117
- Let me see.
- The deal is for 5,000.

16
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,317
I told my people
there should be five grand.

17
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,109
- They stiffed us.
- No, they stiffed you.

18
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,432
You can't count on anybody.
But let's not hassle about it now.

19
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,399
Take the two grand and on the next
score, I'll make it up to you.

20
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,517
Don't jerk me off. This is bullshit.

21
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,831
I need $5,000, not $2,000.
Don't do this to me.

22
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,673
Come on, you ain't dealin'
with Johnny Bananas.

23
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,320
I know I ain't.
Can I have my money?

24
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,313
Can I say it slow for you?
I need $5,000. Read my lips.

25
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,870
$5,000 is what I need.
I can't do nothing with that.

26
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,236
You want to be an asshole,
smoke 'em yourself.

27
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,959
I don't smoke Lucky Strike.
I smoke King Size Kent.

28
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,480
Fuck this.
Nice doing business with you.

29
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,712
What you doing here?

30
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,270
Officer, you know what happened?
You ain't going to believe it.

31
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,353
The truck just stopped. You got
some cables, you give me a jump?

32
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,918
- Don't I know you?
- No, I'm from Buffalo.

33
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,676
Break out some ID.

34
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,235
Let's get the fuck outta here!

35
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,433
Shit!

36
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,712
Freeze, asshole!

37
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,919
Foley, we should have known
it was you!

38
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,756
Axel. Way to go!

39
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,035
- I don't have time.
- Todd's after you.

40
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,671
He said it's your worst fuck-up.
I don't think that's true.

41
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,115
- He's not in there.
- I see that.

42
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,557
If you'd busted them, maybe he
wouldn't be so mad, but you haggled.

43
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,791
$2,000 wasn't enough.
They'd have known I was a cop.

44
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,952
- Leave me alone.
- Don't go anywhere.

45
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,600
- You asshole.
- I'm not saying you did wrong,

46
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,116
but if you had busted them,
it would have been better.

47
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,395
- Where you going?
- Out of here.

48
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,869
- Big mistake. You want my advice?
- No.

49
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,952
Go in there, talk to him.
He'll be right back.

50
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,157
Jeff, get away from me.
I'm going to shoot you.

51
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,119
- You know what I would do?
- Lighten up. I'm not listening. OK?

52
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,714
You're making it a lot worse
for yourself.

53
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,756
Look at this. Thank you, guys.

54
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,990
Axel, you got a cigarette?

55
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,198
- Did you write that one?
- Everybody knows about the truck.

56
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,317
Will you listen to me?
I am not listening to you.

57
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,550
Great. Real mature.

58
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,349
I am not listening to Jeffrey,
but he's still talking.

59
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,796
- I hate when you do that.
- Stop, then!

60
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,350
- Is that fucking Foley in here?
- There's Todd, it's show time.

61
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,838
Boss, I know...

62
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,391
Where do you come off going
undercover without my authorisation?

63
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,519
You want to play cowboy cop,
do it in someone else's precinct.

64
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,718
- Want to hear my side of the story?
- What's your side of the story?

65
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,756
Let's hear your side of the story.

66
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,753
Do you know how much this stunt
of yours is going to cost this city?

67
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,356
Cost isn't the issue. It's my blatant
disregard for proper procedure.

68
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,670
You're damn right, wise-ass!

69
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,036
The mayor called the chief,
he called the deputy,

70
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,669
he chewed my ass out.
You see I don't have any of it left!

71
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,593
Where the fuck d'you get
the cigarettes from, anyway?

72
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,832
- From the Dearborn hijack.
- That bust went down last week.

73
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,435
- That truck should be in the pound.
- I told you.

74
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,557
- It's none of your business.
- This isn't my locker.

75
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,950
Listen, Axel.
No more set-ups, you understand?

76
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,474
You're a good cop
with great potential,

77
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,915
but you don't know
every fucking thing.

78
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,551
I'm tired of taking the heat for you.
Once more and you're on the street.

79
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,596
- Do you understand?
- Look...

80
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,875
Do you understand me?

81
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,554
Yeah, I understand. Boss...

82
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,311
Chief ain't chewed it all.
You still got some ass.

83
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,712
Don't fuck with me, Axel.
Not now. Go on, go home.

84
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,268
How you doing, man? How you doing?

85
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,635
Still breaking in people's houses.

86
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,678
What do you expect with that lock?
Buy a real lock.

87
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,479
I got my pistol.
I'll shoot somebody.

88
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,509
I can't afford no electric, close
my fridge. There's roaches in there.

89
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,830
So what's up, man? Look at you!

90
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,912
- When did you get out?
- Six months ago.

91
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,719
And you're just coming to see me now?

92
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,032
I got out early for good time and
I went to California, get some sun.

93
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,076
I gotta show you something.

94
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,470
I ain't seen you in two years, man.
What's up?

95
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,152
10,000 Deutschmarks.

96
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,276
- Deutschmark?
- Yeah.

97
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,069
- What is that?
- They're bearer bonds. Untraceable.

98
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,116
You stole 'em?

99
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,590
- No.
- I don't want to hear it.

100
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,990
- It's just good to see you.
- I missed you, man.

101
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,399
- What were you doing in California?
- Working.

102
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,436
- Working where?
- Guess.

103
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,670
- I don't know.
- Beverly Hills.

104
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,516
- What were you doing?
- You won't believe this.

105
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,114
I was a security guard.

106
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,068
Who'd hire you as a security guard?

107
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,156
- Jenny Summers.
- Jenny Summers?

108
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,436
I haven't seen Jenny in years.

109
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,636
- What's she up to?
- She's doing great.

110
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,790
She's manager of this art gallery.

111
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,678
The Hollis Benton Art Gallery,
Beverly Hills.

112
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,069
It's world famous. Ever hear of it?

113
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,152
Yeah, I buy all my art there.

114
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,196
Corner pocket, two cushions.

115
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,113
- 50 bucks you don't make that shot.
- Bullshit.

116
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,589
- 100.
- You got a bet.

117
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,797
- What are you gonna do?
- You're as bright as always.

118
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,589
20, 40, 60, 80, take it.
Have a party.

119
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,433
Pleasure doing business with you.

120
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,795
What the fuck you gonna do?

121
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,189
Miss, two more Scotch and sodas.

122
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,910
I got a great idea.
I got a great idea.

123
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,309
Let's steal a car.

124
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,636
Are you serious?

125
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,030
I'm a fucking police officer.
I can't steal cars no more.

126
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,032
How many times
have you stolen a car, man?

127
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,076
A fucking Cadillac!

128
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,636
Driving on the expressway
like two fucking maniacs.

129
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,113
I remember you went to jail for that.

130
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,716
- No, it was state school.
- That's jail when you're 15.

131
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,509
That ain't jail, man. That's like
day camp compared to jail.

132
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,158
How come you didn't tell on me
when you got caught?

133
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,314
You don't know?

134
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,350
- You don't know?
- No.

135
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,309
Because I love you, man.

136
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,714
One more round.

137
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,709
Hold still. Mike, I gotta open
the door, OK? Balance yourself.

138
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,030
Here we go, Mike.

139
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,195
I'm opening the door now, OK?
Here we go.

140
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,032
Axel!

141
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,031
Hey, Mikey, where have you been?

142
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,076
What's up, Zack?

143
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,116
What have you got there, Mikey?

144
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,156
What is this? Your laundry?

145
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,235
I swear,
I was going to bring 'em back.

146
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,675
- You got lost?
- No.

147
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,833
I came to see my friend. I had 'em
with me. I figured, you know...

148
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,959
- What you doing?
- What am I supposed to do, Mikey?

149
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,591
There was a whole box of them. I
didn't think anybody'd miss a couple.

150
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,591
I figured I'd take 'em...

151
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,513
- Shut up.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

152
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,556
No, shut up.

153
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,078
- Man, please.
- Just shut up, Mikey.

154
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,396
I swear...

155
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,997
I swear, if you ever show
your face out there again...

156
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,471
- Ever.
- I won't. I promise you. I'm sorry.

157
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,394
I fucked up, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

158
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,835
- Ever.
- I'm sorry.

159
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,191
Axel, go to the hospital and get
that bump on your head checked out.

160
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,636
- My head is all right, man.
- It's not a request, Axel.

161
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,870
Boss. Boss...
Can I talk to you for a minute?

162
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,715
I heard you got Rand on this case.

163
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,995
He doesn't know the time of day.

164
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,832
Don't mess with me.

165
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,434
He hasn't left his desk in 12 years.

166
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,239
At least he's had 12 years.

167
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,519
Anyway, it's a homicide case and it
belongs to Rand. Go to the hospital.

168
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,751
- Can I ask around a bit?
- Don't do a thing.

169
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,798
You're skating on thin ice as it is.

170
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,440
We're talking about a friend of mine!

171
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,511
Yes, we are, aren't we?

172
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,636
Let's take a close look at that.

173
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,395
One, a hoodlum friend.
Two, a professional hit.

174
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,675
Three, in a cop's apartment.

175
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,354
This whole thing
stinks to high heaven.

176
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,991
- Why a professional hit?
- I didn't just walk into this town.

177
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,231
Whoever killed your friend
wasn't worried about you.

178
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,995
If they were, you'd be lying
beside him in that meat wagon.

179
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,197
Don't do a damn thing.
Stay out of this.

180
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,114
I'm owed some vacation time.
I want to take my vacation now.

181
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,270
Stay away from this case.

182
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,798
I just need a little vacation,
that's all.

183
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,949
All right, as soon as you finish
at the hospital, you're on vacation.

184
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,792
Thank you.

185
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,872
But if you decide
to butt into this case,

186
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,509
it'll be the longest vacation
you ever heard of.

187
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,799
- Checking in today, sir?
- That depends. This hotel expensive?

188
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,316
Not for Beverly Hills.
Can I get your bags for you?

189
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,073
Yeah, that's my bag
in the front seat.

190
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,470
I'm sorry, sir, we just
have nothing available tonight.

191
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,994
I suggest next time
you call for a reservation

192
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,036
at least a week in advance.

193
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,156
Thank you.

194
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,390
- Hi.
- The nerve of some people!

195
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,833
May I help you?

196
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,036
You have a reservation
for Axel Foley.

197
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,111
Let's see.

198
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,397
I'm sorry, I don't see
anything under that name.

199
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,917
Check Rolling Stone Magazine's
Axel Foley, that's what it is.

200
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,477
No, no Rolling Stone, no Axel Foley.
I'm sorry, sir.

201
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:02,350
You probably just made a mistake.
Just give me another room.

202
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,908
Sorry, sir,
but there are none available.

203
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,114
Don't you think I realise what's
going on? Who do you think I am?

204
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,873
If I was some hotshot
from out of town

205
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,590
and you'd made a reservation mistake,
I'd be the first to get a room.

206
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,309
I'm not some hotshot, I'm
a small reporter from Rolling Stone,

207
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,709
here to do an interview
with Michael Jackson,

208
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,519
that's gonna be
in every major magazine.

209
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,036
I wanted to call it Jackson
ls Sitting On Top Of The World.

210
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,078
Now I'll call it
Jackson Can Sit On Top Of The World

211
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,630
But Not ln The Beverly Palm Hotel
Cos There's No Niggers Allowed.

212
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,236
Excuse me, sir, it seems
we have a last-minute cancellation.

213
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,629
There is a room available, a suite,

214
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,712
but I'll charge you
the single-room rate.

215
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,439
Thank you. I'm sorry,
it's probably jet lag.

216
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,556
- I understand.
- What's the rate?

217
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,676
That'll be $235 a night, sir.

218
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,236
Fine.

219
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,232
- That'll be suite 1035.
- Thank you very much.

220
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,276
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

221
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,720
If Michael calls,
tell him what room I'm in.

222
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,755
Of course.

223
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,876
- How you are doing?
- Hi.

224
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,669
I'm fine. My name is Serge.
How can I help you?

225
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,910
I'm looking for Miss Jenny Summers.

226
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,710
It's very busy today.
You give me your name?

227
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,190
- My name's Axel Foley.
- What it's pertaining?

228
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,637
- I didn't understand.
- Pertaining, meaning, regarding...

229
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,314
Oh, what's it regarding?
I'm an old acquaintance.

230
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,436
Donny.

231
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,476
One moment.

232
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,396
Donny, tell Miss Summers
that Ahmed Farley's here to...

233
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,472
- No, Axel Foley.
- Ahmel...Ahwell...

234
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,117
Foley's here,
he's an old acquaintance.

235
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,952
Cover this up.

236
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,157
It's like the breast of a dog
to scrub for the customer.

237
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,800
- It's not sexy, it's animal.
- Not sexy at all.

238
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,113
May I offer you something to drink?
Wine, cocktail, espresso?

239
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,989
No, thank you.

240
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,390
I make it myself, with a lemon twist.
You should try it.

241
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,835
No, I'm fine.

242
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,708
- I see you look at this piece.
- How much would it go for?

243
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,518
$130,000.

244
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,830
- Get the fuck outta here.
- No, I cannot.

245
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,070
It's a very important piece.

246
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,993
- Ever sold one of these?
- Yesterday.

247
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,153
- Get the fuck outta here.
- I'm serious. I sell it myself.

248
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,912
What are you doing here?

249
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,595
- How you doing?
- I'm fine. Hold on a second.

250
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,069
Great. Excuse me, Serge.

251
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,553
- What are you doing here?
- How you doing?

252
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,108
It's good to see you.
How've you been?

253
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,156
- Look at you!
- You like?

254
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,390
Yeah. You're getting old.

255
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,072
Fuck you.

256
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,116
- What is this?
- A moustache.

257
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,749
- Peach fuzz.
- No, that's man style now.

258
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,796
You have someplace we can talk?

259
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,555
Yeah. Over there. Come on.

260
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,074
- You've filled out.
- Yeah, I filled out.

261
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,116
No, it looks good, though.

262
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,316
Sit down.

263
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,236
- I want to talk about Mikey.
- Is he in trouble again?

264
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,590
He's dead.

265
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,032
What?

266
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,078
He came into Detroit
and somebody killed him.

267
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,556
I don't believe this.

268
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,356
Look, I can't right now.
I'll be up in a second.

269
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,035
Mikey mentioned
that you helped him get a job.

270
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,553
Yeah...

271
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,272
The guy who owns this gallery
hired him as a favour to me.

272
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,356
- Who's this guy?
- His name is Victor Maitland.

273
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,433
He was working for Victor
at the gallery's warehouse.

274
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,876
I can't talk now,
I have to go upstairs.

275
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,116
That's cool.

276
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,954
I'll call you later on
and we'll get together and talk, OK?

277
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,598
Sure.

278
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,796
Be good.

279
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,233
Hi. Delivery for Victor Maitland.

280
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,595
I'll take it upstairs to him.

281
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,750
Maybe I should give it to him myself.

282
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,831
Deliveries should be left here.

283
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,639
He has to get these flowers.
I'll go up myself.

284
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,676
You're not supposed to.

285
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,638
Floral delivery is my life.
I have to take it.

286
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,871
- Who let you in?
- I let myself in.

287
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,270
How you doing? I have some questions
about Michael Tandino.

288
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,875
Speak to you later, darling.

289
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,758
What, may I ask,
is your interest in Mr Tandino?

290
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,469
He was my best friend. He visited me
in Detroit a couple of days ago.

291
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,518
Soon after he got there,
someone killed him.

292
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,194
Oh, my God. That's terrible.

293
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,077
It's fucked up.

294
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,838
And? What do you wish to know?

295
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,829
- He worked for you, didn't he?
- Yes, yes, he did.

296
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,150
Good gracious!

297
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,596
I'm really sorry to hear this.
Would you like to sit down?

298
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,274
Can I get you anything?

299
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,638
- No, I'm all right.
- How on earth did this happen?

300
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,359
Detroit is a very violent city,
isn't it?

301
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,475
Yeah.

302
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,076
I do hope the police have procured
some intelligent leads.

303
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,675
Exactly what did Mikey do for you?

304
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,995
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

305
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,352
My name is Foley.

306
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,830
Excuse me, Mr Foley,
if I appear a little rude,

307
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,232
but this sounds like something
for the authorities in Detroit.

308
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,154
So, if you'll forgive me,
I must get back to work.

309
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,313
- All I want to know is...
- Please show Mr Foley to the door.

310
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,755
- Get the fuck off me.
- Hey, take it easy.

311
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,152
Get off me, man.
Get the fuck off me. Get off!

312
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,874
Get the fuck off me, man. Get off!

313
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,989
Get off me. Think I'm playing games?
I'm fucking somebody up.

314
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,276
What the fuck is this shit?

315
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,629
Did you see that?
I can describe them all.

316
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,154
Put your hands
on the hood of the car.

317
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,676
- What's with you guys?
- You heard him, sir. Do it now.

318
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,558
What kind of shit is this?
Wait a second.

319
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,916
You're arresting me
for getting thrown out of a window?

320
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,389
I got thrown out of a window, man!

321
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,436
Gun, partner!

322
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,231
Sir, you're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

323
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,834
Anything you say will be used
against you in court.

324
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,195
You have the right
to have an attorney.

325
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,236
I understand the rights.

326
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,118
This is bullshit.
I got thrown out of a window.

327
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,760
- Get in the car.
- What's the charge?

328
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,150
Possession of a concealed weapon
and disturbing the peace.

329
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,310
I got thrown out of a window!

330
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,676
What's the charge for getting
pushed out of a car, jaywalking?

331
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,512
This is bullshit!

332
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,278
You know, this is the cleanest and
nicest police car I've ever been in.

333
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,316
It's nicer than my apartment.

334
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:54,752
Officers, if we see any movie stars
could you point them out to me?

335
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,796
That's enough talking.

336
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,950
OK, that's cool.

337
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,476
This is nice.

338
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,036
It's about time. I thought
you'd forgot me. I was hungry.

339
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,716
I've never seen a cell with a phone.
Could I stay cos I ordered pizza?

340
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,476
Somebody'll eat it.

341
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,832
Have a seat right over there, please.

342
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,878
I'm Sergeant Taggart and this
is my partner, Detective Rosewood.

343
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,919
Do you always treat visitors
from out of town like this?

344
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,794
Why didn't you say you were a police
officer when you were arrested?

345
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,678
Where do you get off
arresting somebody

346
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,876
for getting thrown out of a window?

347
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,713
Six witnesses say you started
tearing up the place,

348
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,756
then jumped out the window.

349
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,597
You believe that? What the fuck
are you, cops or doormen?

350
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,195
We're more likely to believe
an important local businessman

351
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,236
than a foul-mouthed jerk.

352
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,550
Foul-mouthed? Fuck you, man.

353
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,029
- Watch your mouth.
- Don't square off on me.

354
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,680
- Don't push me.
- Fuck you, man.

355
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,989
Taggart!

356
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,354
- Yes, sir.
- Come here.

357
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,550
Sir...

358
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,279
I apologise for striking you.

359
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,590
I have no excuse.

360
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,791
Forget about it.

361
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,192
I am Lieutenant Bogomil of
the Beverly Hills Police Department.

362
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,068
Do you wish to file charges
against Sergeant Taggart?

363
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,912
Is this a joke?

364
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,278
Do you wish to file charges
against this officer for assault?

365
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,831
Where I'm from, cops don't
file charges against other cops.

366
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,673
No, I don't want to do that.

367
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,150
In Beverly Hills,
we go strictly by the book.

368
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,993
Why didn't you inform us
when you came to town?

369
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,150
I'm on vacation.

370
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,198
Then why were you
in Victor Maitland's office?

371
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,716
I had to go to the bathroom.
It looked like a nice clean place.

372
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,957
- Always take your gun on vacation?
- Don't know. Never been on vacation.

373
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,873
But, in Detroit,
cops must always carry a firearm.

374
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,793
If you want to carry a gun,
go back there.

375
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,155
I really can't wait to get back.

376
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,279
Is that so? I just spoke
to lnspector Todd in Detroit.

377
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,510
Does that name ring a bell?

378
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,110
- He's my boss.
- You may not be welcome back.

379
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,798
He says you're
an outstanding young detective.

380
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,348
I find that difficult to believe.

381
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,192
It's true.

382
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,319
He also says he nearly fired you.
I find that very easy to believe.

383
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,916
What are you doing here?

384
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,309
I'm on vacation.
I went to the bathroom

385
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,595
and six guys threw me out a window.

386
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,673
Inspector Todd gave me a message
for you. Wanna hear it?

387
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,795
No.

388
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,031
He says if you're here
investigating the Tandino murder,

389
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,190
don't bother coming back.

390
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,477
If we inform him
you are working on this case,

391
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,516
he'll have you fired.

392
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,750
One last time, what are you doing?

393
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,796
I'm on vacation!

394
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,393
Vacation.

395
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,390
Rosewood, take Mr Foley
over to the courthouse

396
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,835
and let him arrange for bail.

397
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,911
Follow me, sir.

398
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,118
I got to hand it to you guys,
you are extremely polite.

399
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,118
Pretty good punch you got, Taggart.

400
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,956
After you.

401
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,075
After you.

402
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,355
You guys are so sweet, you know that?

403
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,757
Thanks for bailing me out, Jen.

404
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,515
If I'd known why you'd been arrested,
I wouldn't have come.

405
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,639
- You don't mean that.
- No, I don't mean that.

406
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,678
If it wasn't for Victor Maitland,
I'd be a waitress.

407
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,231
The day Mikey got killed, he showed
up with a bag of German bearer bonds.

408
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,073
I think he stole them
from whoever killed him.

409
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,470
When I mentioned Mikey's name,
Maitland threw me out.

410
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,634
You look like a hoodlum. You barge
into his office, carrying a gun.

411
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,792
If I didn't know you,
I'd throw you out.

412
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,632
Is this your car?

413
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,553
No. In Beverly Hills
we just take the closest one.

414
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:14,033
I remember you used to drive
that crappy blue Chevy Nova.

415
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,270
What are you driving now?

416
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,318
The same crappy blue Chevy Nova.

417
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,551
Do you think it's too late
for me to study art?

418
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,677
Axel, why were you bothering Victor?

419
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,469
You don't think he has anything
to do with Mikey's death?

420
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,712
No, I was just poking around.
I don't think he did nothing.

421
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,715
Victor is one of the top art dealers
in the US, he has been for ten years.

422
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,156
I'm impressed.

423
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,954
- What are you looking at?
- The cops, they're following us.

424
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,679
What? Where?

425
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,358
In the back, on the right.
Beige Ford.

426
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,150
Can you believe this place?

427
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,515
How can you afford this?

428
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,955
They only charged me
the single-room rate.

429
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,429
- How can you afford that?
- I can't.

430
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,080
In the bathroom they got little robes

431
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,390
with the hotel's initials on it.

432
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,710
I love this place, I can't leave.

433
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,030
- I'm going to steal one. Want one?
- No.

434
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,317
You want some slippers?
I'm going to steal them, too.

435
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,836
Excuse me, two seconds.

436
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:55,116
Hello, room service?
This is Mr Axel Foley in suite 1035.

437
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,431
I'd like to order something
from your late supper menu.

438
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,478
I want you to deliver it
to this beige Ford on Wilshire.

439
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,758
Send down one bay shrimp
salad sandwich. OK?

440
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,270
Right. And is the cold poached salmon
in dill sauce tasty?

441
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,831
OK, send one of those down.
And send down something for dessert.

442
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,036
All right. Thank you.

443
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,076
You're quite a sport.

444
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,833
How long are you going to stay?

445
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,275
Until I find out who killed Mikey.

446
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:31,470
And I'm considering checking out
the warehouse where he worked.

447
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,677
Really?
How you planning on getting in?

448
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,590
- Good evening, sir.
- What is that?

449
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,274
Late supper,
compliments of Mr Axel Foley.

450
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:04,115
- Foley? How'd he know we were here?
- Because I let you drive.

451
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,475
I need a couple of bananas. How much?

452
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,588
The buffet plate is $12.50. You get
peaches, plums, oranges and bananas.

453
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,513
All I need is a couple of bananas.

454
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,635
Go ahead, take those bananas.

455
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,711
Thank you.

456
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,994
- I'm not eating that. Take it back.
- Certainly.

457
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,036
This really looks great.

458
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,635
- Could I get some extra mayo?
- Certainly, sir.

459
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,710
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

460
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,917
There's the Mercedes.
Will you get rid of that stuff?

461
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,515
What the hell are you doing?

462
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,596
This the place?

463
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,478
Yeah, but I'm not sure
I should do this.

464
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,519
OK, but when you hear glass breaking,
don't get scared.

465
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,637
It's just me kicking in the window.
Sit tight.

466
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,154
All right. Come on, Axel.

467
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,037
- What's happening, baby?
- Grow up.

468
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,837
- Did you find something?
- Coffee grounds.

469
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,876
So?

470
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,235
You know what this is used for?

471
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,595
People add hot water and drink it.

472
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,832
I'll take this home, add hot water
and drink it in the morning.

473
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,636
What are we hiding for?

474
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,359
I wish you'd been with me last night.

475
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,233
- What happened?
- We stopped in a joint for a drink.

476
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,276
- Which one?
- A local joint.

477
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,232
Some guy comes in,
sits a couple of stools away.

478
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,313
He's got one of them eyes
that's going like this.

479
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,517
I didn't know whether he was trying
to put the make on me.

480
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,795
I thought I'd take you there tonight,

481
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,395
Iet him have a shot at you
before I tore his head off.

482
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,714
Let's go. I want to get out of here.

483
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,792
- Just get off my back.
- Come on.

484
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,430
I got it.

485
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,669
- What the hell's going on?
- I'll tell you later.

486
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,792
Hurry up.

487
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,269
- Give me the key.
- Ever driven a Mercedes?

488
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,999
A car's a car.
I drive mine every day.

489
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,789
- I'm driving, I've seen your car.
- Shit, that's cold.

490
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,358
How could you not notice a man
sticking a banana in your tailpipe?

491
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,510
- He distracted us.
- How?

492
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,115
He sent us a late supper.
This waiter comes over...

493
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,236
Billy, he gets the point.

494
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,472
A late supper?
And what did you have, Rosewood?

495
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,276
I think it was
a shrimp salad sandwich, sir.

496
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,875
- A shrimp salad sandwich?
- Yes, sir.

497
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,473
I want you two to go back
to the hotel and wait for Foley.

498
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,030
If you lose him again,
don't bother calling in. Got that?

499
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,588
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

500
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,756
A late supper.

501
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,870
We've got something for you, Billy.

502
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,519
An anti-banana disguise.

503
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,678
- It may come in handy.
- A little extra protection, Billy.

504
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,716
Very funny.

505
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,675
Let's go.

506
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,075
- You take the car and go home.
- What about you?

507
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,916
I want to find out about this place.

508
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,070
It's a bonded warehouse.

509
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,755
They hold our foreign shipments
till they clear customs.

510
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,274
I'm going to check it out. Go home.

511
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,148
Damn it, Axel.
I'm not going to bail you out again.

512
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,390
Go home.

513
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,758
How you doing?
Come here for a second, please.

514
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,154
- Hi, you have a match?
- No smoking in here.

515
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,949
I'm going to smoke when
I go outside. Thank you very much.

516
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,190
- Is your supervisor here?
- In the office.

517
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,316
- Will you get him?
- What's the problem?

518
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,515
You security?

519
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,910
Then you're the fucking problem.
Get your supervisor. Now.

520
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,999
Now!

521
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,308
OK.

522
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,149
He didn't come back yet.

523
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,194
What do we do now?

524
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,236
We wait.

525
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,869
OK.

526
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,918
- Can I help you?
- Are you the supervisor?

527
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,037
- Yes. Who are you?
- Inspector Rafferty, US Customs.

528
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,556
- Has all this gone through customs?
- No, this is the bonded area.

529
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,189
Then tell me,
how can a black man, dressed like me,

530
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,999
just march in and start poking around

531
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,640
without being asked any questions?

532
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,360
- I don't know.
- That's the answer I wanted.

533
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,716
Give me your ID numbers.
Somebody's going to lose their job.

534
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,634
- He gave me a match.
- You gave him a match?

535
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,871
Listen. I do security checks
all over the nation.

536
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,916
And apart from Cleveland,

537
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,117
this place has the worst security
in the nation.

538
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,998
Call your wives
cos we'll be here all night.

539
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,197
We're gonna check the background
of every crate,

540
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,191
starting with this one.

541
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,156
It says here that by the time
the average American is 50,

542
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,518
he's got five pounds
of undigested red meat in his bowels.

543
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,796
Why are you telling me this?

544
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,589
What makes you think
I have any interest in that at all?

545
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,035
Well, you eat a lot of red meat.

546
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,593
The inspector needs
the information on those bills.

547
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,477
All the manifests, too.

548
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:41,030
And records of all shipments
due into the same destination.

549
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,270
- What's this about?
- Just do it.

550
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,033
You got a warrant for this?

551
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:50,477
You have a very big mouth, sir.
Are you hiding something from me?

552
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,757
I bet that's your Porsche outside.
Is it?

553
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,118
Would you like me to have the IRS
crawl up your ass with a microscope?

554
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,237
It's not pretty.
I want you to know something.

555
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,791
I want you all to know, I could
have 25 agents here in 15 minutes,

556
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:10,032
to march in here, snatch your bond
and you'd be out of business,

557
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,156
if you don't cooperate. Understood?

558
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,800
We'll give you everything you need.

559
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,518
- Everything you need.
- That's not my Porsche, sir.

560
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,639
You've nothing to worry about, then.
You all take me for a fool. Hurry!

561
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,034
I notice you've been drinking
a lot of coffee lately.

562
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,116
I think that's why
you have a hard time relaxing.

563
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,996
Jesus Christ!
You almost gave me a heart attack.

564
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,073
- What are you doing here so late?
- You're a cocky son of a bitch.

565
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,913
If you're still mad
about the banana, I'm sorry.

566
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,991
I needed some time to myself.

567
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:13,868
I wish I'd seen your face
when the car conked out.

568
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,918
Very funny. The lieutenant
docked us two days' pay.

569
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,956
Get outta here!

570
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,796
- He's not kidding.
- No, he's not kidding.

571
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,075
By the way, thanks for the sandwich.

572
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,956
It was a joke, like the bananas.

573
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:36,876
I know what it's like on a stakeout.
That food was from the heart.

574
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,269
Bullshit!

575
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:43,239
Why are we always arguing? We're all
cops. We should work together.

576
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,472
We've all had a rough day.

577
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:50,190
What do you say we go get something
to drink, make up and be friends?

578
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,190
Forget it.

579
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,149
OK, fuck it. I'm going to get
a drink. Follow me if you want.

580
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,038
But I lost you once, I can again.

581
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,669
Why don't we get something
to drink together? Let's be friends.

582
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,116
- We don't drink on duty.
- OK. Fine.

583
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:12,432
But listen. I found
the perfect place. I saw it today.

584
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:16,718
It's perfect for you. It's
very conservative. You'll love it.

585
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,155
It's nice. Trust me.

586
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,750
- Hi. Can I get you something?
- Yes!

587
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,913
Can I have a Scotch and soda?
What do you want?

588
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,878
- Light beers for them.
- Two club sodas.

589
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,277
You crack me up
with this "on duty" shit.

590
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,239
Billy, you don't have to be
embarrassed if your dick is hard.

591
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,390
Your dick is supposed to get hard.
That's the whole object.

592
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,517
Taggart's dick is hard,
but he won't say. He's the boss.

593
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,477
Boss's dick got to stay limp.

594
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,438
I ain't on duty
so my dick can be hard.

595
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,955
Taggart, look. I found that
at Maitland's warehouse.

596
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,399
- Billy! Give her this.
- No.

597
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,948
Stuff that in her thing.
She'll go nuts.

598
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,356
Excuse me.

599
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,792
Billy.

600
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,836
- What do you think?
- Coffee grounds. So?

601
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:39,232
You guys don't know nothing
about nothing, do you?

602
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:43,279
Make sure we get the right drinks.
I drink club soda, I'll throw up.

603
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,677
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.

604
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,036
- She likes you.
- Think so?

605
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,917
No doubt.

606
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,716
Taggart... See that guy
over there in the black coat?

607
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,278
- Black jacket?
- Yeah.

608
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,511
It's June.
Isn't it hot for a long leather coat?

609
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,316
- Yeah, a little.
- Yeah.

610
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,755
Look at his partner.
They just came in.

611
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,234
Something's getting ready to go down.

612
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,392
- Go and cover that guy.
- What's going on?

613
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,349
I'll check out this asshole at the
bar. Billy will make sure I behave.

614
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,398
Will somebody tell me
what's going on?

615
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,156
No bullshit this time.

616
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,790
Just sit tight, Billy.

617
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,517
Philip!

618
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,194
Man, what's happening, Phil?

619
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,035
He said you don't come here no more,
but I said, "It's Phil".

620
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,114
- Get out of here, man.
- I told you!

621
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,033
- Give me a kiss, baby.
- I said get outta here!

622
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,875
Everybody freeze!

623
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,316
Turn around. Turn around!

624
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,358
- Phil!
- Keep your hands on the table!

625
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,079
What's wrong?
What's all the hostility?

626
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,993
- Get back.
- What's all this gun, man?

627
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,036
You changed.

628
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,111
Get back or I'll
blow your brains out.

629
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,630
Police. Move and I'll kill you.

630
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,114
Don't move! Turn over!

631
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,357
Way to go, Rosewood.
You're some cop. You know that?

632
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,718
Sorry for the disturbance, folks.
Everything's under control.

633
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,873
Taggart.

634
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,515
Would you explain why
you and Rosewood were in a strip bar

635
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,319
out of our jurisdiction
while you were on duty?

636
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,473
Before you chastise these officers,
there's something you should know.

637
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:45,793
The only reason they were at a strip
bar is because they were tailing me.

638
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,633
They were outside
wondering what I was doing.

639
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,951
I was in having a good time.
I'm into those things.

640
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,030
These guys waited outside
and the only reason they came in

641
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:00,671
was because they saw two men with
bulges in their jackets going in.

642
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,073
Well, these guys
were going to commit a robbery.

643
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:08,358
They watched them, waited for them to
make their move, then foiled a crime.

644
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,318
I did not know what was going on.

645
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,358
I'm freaked out.
They must have a sixth sense.

646
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:19,150
I don't know what you teach them,
but they're not just regular cops.

647
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,992
They're supercops.

648
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:24,038
The only thing missing
on these guys are capes.

649
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,840
Is this what really happened?

650
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,436
No, sir.

651
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,715
Would someone tell me what happened?

652
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,750
Well...

653
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:44,391
Foley invited us to this bar.
We accepted.

654
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,313
- We ordered club sodas, sir.
- Right.

655
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,960
And while we were there,

656
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,235
Foley observed the two suspects

657
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,276
casing the establishment.

658
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,318
And before we knew what was going on,

659
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,198
he'd already disarmed one of them.

660
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,751
Detective Foley deserves
all the credit for the arrests, sir.

661
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:09,958
Detective Foley,
we appreciate your assistance,

662
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,634
but if you want to practise
law enforcement,

663
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,359
I would prefer you did it in Detroit.

664
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,834
I understand. I'm sorry.

665
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,593
But before I go
I want you two to know,

666
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,069
the supercops story was working.

667
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:29,910
OK? It was working
and you guys just messed it up.

668
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,357
I'm trying to figure you guys out,
but I haven't yet. But it's cool.

669
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,796
Just fuck up a perfectly good lie
and it's all right.

670
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,633
You guys are off the case.

671
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,190
Foster, McCabe, your turn.

672
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,191
- Don't lose him.
- Not a chance, sir.

673
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,270
And you two...

674
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,316
In my office.

675
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,793
Morning, gentlemen.
Coffee and doughnuts?

676
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,593
- What?
- Coffee and doughnuts.

677
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,750
There he is.

678
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,919
Morning, officers.
You the second team?

679
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,996
We're the first team.

680
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,514
We won't fall
for a banana in the tailpipe.

681
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,751
You won't fall
for the banana in the tailpipe?

682
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,559
It should be more natural,
brother, like this.

683
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,713
"I ain't falling for no banana in my
tailpipe." It's more natural for us.

684
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,315
You've been hanging out
with this dude too long.

685
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,836
I'm sorry, I'm just fucking with you.
That's funny to me.

686
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,910
- You gonna try to keep up with me?
- No problem.

687
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,629
- Isn't this Victor Maitland's house?
- Yeah, I think so.

688
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:27,078
I've seen enough.
You want something to drink?

689
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,355
I got some stuff in the trunk.

690
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,396
Excuse me.

691
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,631
For a man on vacation,
you look like you're on a stakeout.

692
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:50,350
Stakeout? No, no. I'm picnicking.
This is a picnic area.

693
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,558
I've been shooting the shit
long enough.

694
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,598
Time for me to take in some sights.
Excuse me.

695
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,876
What the hell's he doing?

696
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,630
Can you put this in a good spot?

697
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,678
This shit happened
last time I parked here.

698
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,469
May I help you?

699
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,358
I'm looking for Victor Maitland.

700
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,714
You realise that
this is a members only club?

701
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,678
I have to talk to Victor.
It's very important.

702
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,558
- Victor Maitland, are you sure?
- Yes.

703
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:41,030
Grey-haired gentleman.
Very dark skin. Capricorn.

704
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,396
Why don't you give me the message
and I'll take it to him?

705
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:50,474
OK. Tell Victor that Ramon,
the fella he met about a week ago...

706
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,393
Tell him that
Ramon went to the clinic,

707
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,392
and I found out that I have...

708
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,436
herpes simplex 10.

709
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,830
I think Victor should check himself
out with his physician

710
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,753
before things start falling off
on the man.

711
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,596
Perhaps you better tell him that.

712
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,554
- I think that would be best.
- So do l.

713
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,476
Hi, Victor.

714
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,516
I'm back.

715
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,630
Look, guys, don't even try it.

716
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,995
Why don't you
get the hell out of here?

717
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,355
Get the fuck away from me, man.

718
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:10,072
Very good, Victor. Could you teach
him to roll over and sit, too?

719
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,835
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to you.

720
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,833
- Last time, I didn't get the chance.
- I've nothing to say to you.

721
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,555
That's cool, I'll do all the talking.

722
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,035
This is a very nice place, Vic.

723
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,239
Hi. I like this. This is nice.

724
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,078
Glad you like it.
I must make you a member.

725
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,832
Victor, I know that you're into
a lot of crooked shit.

726
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,230
And I have a pretty good idea
that you had Mikey killed.

727
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,039
And when I find out for sure,

728
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,190
I'm going to fuck you up real bad.

729
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,236
Is that so?

730
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:51,392
Now listen to me,
my tough little friend.

731
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,189
I don't know
from under what stone you crawled

732
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,590
or where you get
these ridiculous ideas about me,

733
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,069
but it seems painfully obvious

734
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,628
you haven't
the slightest fucking idea

735
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,950
who you're dealing with.

736
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:09,157
Now, my advice to you

737
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,391
is crawl back to your little stone
in Detroit

738
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,870
before you get squashed, OK?

739
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:19,557
- Please step away from the table.
- Gotta go now, Vic.

740
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:22,632
- Nice meeting you again.
- Yeah.

741
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,197
Catch you later, Vic.

742
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,996
I can't wait.

743
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:48,197
Don't I know you guys?
You look so familiar.

744
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,916
Detective Foley,
this is becoming very irritating.

745
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,958
Why are you bothering
Victor Maitland?

746
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,553
I had a friend, Michael Tandino,
who used to work for him.

747
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:07,918
Maitland had him killed. When I can
prove it you'll be the first to know.

748
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,873
Forget what you can prove,
talk to me.

749
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:19,992
OK. Listen. Everybody knows Victor
Maitland is a hotshot art dealer.

750
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:23,152
But I poked around.
Art's not the only thing he deals.

751
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,879
I saw some guys in his warehouse

752
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,110
unloading a crate
of German bearer bonds.

753
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,954
Michael Tandino had bonds
like this on him, coincidentally,

754
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,996
when he was killed.

755
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,753
Just because Maitland invests
in the same bonds

756
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,796
doesn't mean he's a killer.

757
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,792
The man's not an investor,
he's a smuggler,

758
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,871
be it bonds, drugs or whatever.

759
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:46,918
The crate I saw
didn't even pass through customs.

760
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,514
Maitland is paying
to get his shipments out

761
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,352
before they're inspected.

762
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,718
When his guys get it, they take
the drugs or bonds out of the crates

763
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,759
and they send it back before customs
even knows what's going on.

764
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,308
- And you witnessed this?
- Everything except for the drugs.

765
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,550
But I found coffee grounds
everywhere.

766
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:11,990
- Coffee grounds?
- What does that mean?

767
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:15,231
Drugs are packed in coffee.
The scent throws off the dogs.

768
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,553
Very good. Now what do we do?

769
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,916
Look, Detective Foley, l...

770
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,072
I'm sorry.
I'd really like to help you.

771
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,515
If you'd found the drugs,
that's one thing,

772
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:33,559
but if your only evidence is coffee,
we can't get a search warrant.

773
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,596
We can get around that.

774
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,717
We don't "get around"
search warrants.

775
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,834
Taggart, I want you
to start checking this out.

776
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,071
Start with the LAPD,
the FBI and the Customs Service.

777
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:51,039
Wait a minute.
Maitland is much smarter than that.

778
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,315
We snoop around, he'll close down

779
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,914
and get his shipments from elsewhere.

780
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,879
Really? ls that what your
extensive experience tells you?

781
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,872
I haven't been on the force...

782
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,515
Shit.

783
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,239
- Is this the man?
- Yes, sir.

784
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:14,279
The gentleman that crashed
through Victor Maitland's window?

785
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:17,989
Who disabled an unmarked unit
with a banana?

786
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,433
Yes, sir.

787
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:22,478
Who lured Taggart and Rosemont

788
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:26,109
into a gross dereliction of duty

789
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,998
at a striptease establishment?

790
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,389
It's Rosewood, sir.

791
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,436
Yes, sir.

792
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,988
Is this the gentleman
who ruined the buffet

793
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,832
at the Harrow Club today?

794
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,478
Yes, sir.

795
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:45,236
I just bet you are the pride
of your department in Detroit.

796
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,994
Lieutenant,
I'd like to see you in your office.

797
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,036
Yes, sir.

798
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:02,676
Is this the man who wrecked the
buffet at the Harrow Club today?

799
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:06,469
- Lower your voice.
- Can he hear me through the wall?

800
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,916
Yes, he can.

801
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:29,589
Rosewood, take Detective Foley
back to his hotel room,

802
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,636
watch him pack,

803
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,473
and escort him to the city limits.

804
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,835
Then you can give him his gun back.

805
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:42,671
The two charges of disturbing the
peace have been dropped against you.

806
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:45,149
But if you return to Beverly Hills,

807
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,390
the charges will be reinstated

808
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,870
and you will be prosecuted
to the limit of the law.

809
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,554
- Sir, may I say something?
- What?

810
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,631
He seems to have enough...

811
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:58,029
You want to tell that to the chief?

812
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:02,271
- No, sir.
- Then I suggest you get moving.

813
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:06,070
Come on, Axel.

814
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:26,550
Right. Let me check on that tomorrow
and get back to you.

815
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,631
Thank you.

816
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,790
- Hi.
- Victor, hi.

817
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:35,353
- Sit down. I'm not interrupting?
- Of course not.

818
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,475
There's a gentleman in town
from Detroit

819
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,552
who says he's a friend
of Michael Tandino.

820
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:46,831
He came by the office yesterday and
asked me all sorts of odd questions.

821
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,672
Excuse me, darling.

822
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,149
I believe his name is Foley.

823
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,310
Since you were a friend of Michael,

824
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,551
I was wondering
if you knew the fellow.

825
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,438
We grew up in the same neighbourhood.

826
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,750
Really? Have you seen him lately?

827
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,516
He came in yesterday.

828
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,595
What? He came by here?

829
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,832
And?

830
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:17,237
He told me that Mikey
had been killed.

831
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,595
Yes. Yes, I know.

832
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:26,073
- And then?
- That's it.

833
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:29,835
He left and I haven't seen him since.

834
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,831
Jenny, darling,
do you know where he's staying?

835
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:38,435
I have some information
which might be helpful for him.

836
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,796
No, I have no idea.

837
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:54,830
I hope I didn't disturb you.

838
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,878
- No problem.
- We'll have dinner soon, yes?

839
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:01,195
- That'd be lovely.
- Take care.

840
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:17,511
I read the manifests. They're
expecting another shipment in today.

841
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,913
Bogomil...

842
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,152
This is a chance for me and you
to blow this case wide open.

843
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,435
I wish I could, but I can't.

844
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,272
Why?

845
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,669
Because Bogomil would kill me.

846
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:38,392
I'm not going to drive you
to the art gallery.

847
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:42,075
It's easy. Jenny will let us in
Maitland's warehouse.

848
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,276
The shipment arrives, we nail them.

849
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:47,477
- How can you be sure it'll be drugs?
- I got a hunch.

850
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:52,475
A technique by which many crimes
outside Beverly Hills get solved.

851
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,518
Why didn't you tell Bogomil
about this shipment?

852
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,196
He does everything by the book.
Is everybody in this town a robot?

853
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:03,033
This thing is very personal to me.

854
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,110
All he asked me to do
was drive you out of town.

855
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,633
Now I'm going to screw that up, too.

856
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:18,117
Billy, I love you.
I just fell in love with you.

857
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,956
Jenny, how are you?

858
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,873
This is my buddy Billy Rosewood.
Jenny Summers.

859
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:29,032
- Billy's a Beverly Hills cop.
- How do you do?

860
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,031
That's Serge.

861
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,873
Can you get my friend an espresso?

862
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:36,269
You want it with a lemon twist?

863
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,956
Sure, if it's no bother.

864
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,679
No, don't be stupid.

865
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:46,196
Victor Maitland was here
asking questions about you today.

866
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:48,555
He was acting real weird.

867
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,677
Look, I want to get back
inside the warehouse.

868
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,396
How about I go with you?

869
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,677
You work in a gallery.
You're not a cop.

870
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,912
If this has to do with Mikey's death,
I want to check it out.

871
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,036
I don't have time to argue with you.

872
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:08,673
Let me get my keys
and we'll argue on the way.

873
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:15,914
Billy, you sit here and observe.
Don't move till I get you.

874
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,959
- Why can't I come in?
- Cos you're a cop in this town.

875
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:23,112
Without probable cause,
it's an illegal search.

876
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,714
Didn't they teach you that
in cop school?

877
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:29,076
- I find some evidence, I'll get you.
- You can't...

878
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:34,871
Be cool, all right? lf anything
jumps off, I'll come and get you.

879
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:39,236
Is there any chance
you'll let me go in by myself?

880
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,276
No chance.

881
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,550
Fuck. Come on.

882
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,996
- Seems they've been already.
- What are you looking for?

883
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,274
This.

884
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,989
A crate from overseas that
hasn't passed through customs yet.

885
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,070
What is that?

886
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,194
Coffee?

887
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,430
Yeah, it's coffee on top.

888
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:09,957
But this ain't sugar.
Go get Rosewood.

889
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,235
Welcome to the party.

890
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,995
It seems we have guests.

891
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:01,275
How nice. I do like surprises.

892
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,076
Jeannette.

893
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:22,558
I just can't tell you how
disappointed I am to find you here.

894
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,716
Shut up!

895
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,835
I don't want to hear it.

896
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,593
Take her to the car and wait for me.

897
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,913
What are you going to do with him?

898
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,118
You should be more worried about
what we're going to do with you.

899
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:00,079
Don't worry. We've got cocaine and
coffee, we're going to have a party.

900
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,630
Thanks for having me over, Vic.
This is very nice.

901
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,472
Did you say something?

902
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:22,393
If something happens to her...

903
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,956
I'm all ears.

904
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,276
I'll kill you.

905
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:33,636
Really? That would be a neat trick.

906
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:49,108
- Well, cuz.
- Are you still pissed at me?

907
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:57,438
No. But I should have
taken care of you in Detroit.

908
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,469
When I popped your little buddy.

909
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,190
Goodbye, Mr Foley.

910
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,992
- Have a nice day.
- I'll try.

911
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,556
Damn it.

912
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,836
Oh, boy.

913
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,875
How's that little bump
on the head I gave you in Detroit?

914
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:07,155
Healed up nice, I hope.

915
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,074
Freeze!

916
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:46,955
Thanks.

917
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:06,117
Tell Taggart to check out
the warehouse. I'll explain later.

918
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:09,078
Sergeant Taggart is here,
he wants to talk to you.

919
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,115
Shit!

920
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:13,033
Billy, what the hell is going on?

921
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:17,033
- Sorry, Sarge, I can't talk now.
- What do you mean?

922
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:21,591
Just check out the warehouse and
please don't say anything to Bogomil.

923
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:24,148
- He's not transmitting any more.
- Shit.

924
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:28,438
- What's the matter?
- Billy's doing something dumb again.

925
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:32,035
- Was he calling from the hotel?
- No, sir.

926
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:35,396
Right now, his car's heading north
on Palm Canyon Road.

927
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:38,950
- We were there this morning.
- What?

928
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,395
Foley was looking over
Maitland's house.

929
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:45,029
- Do you have that warehouse address?
- Yes, sir.

930
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:50,876
Check that place out, let me know
what's going on over there.

931
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,916
Don't talk to anybody but me.

932
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:16,269
Hold it, Foley. You're under arrest.
Billy, why are you here?

933
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:19,158
- I forced him at gunpoint.
- No, he didn't.

934
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:23,552
Everything he said about Maitland
is right. He's kidnapped a woman.

935
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:28,073
- Let's get her.
- What do you think I'm doing?

936
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:32,278
- We'll have a warrant in 20 minutes.
- She could be dead in 20 minutes.

937
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,316
Stop. You're coming with us.

938
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,756
I'm going inside.
You want to stop me, shoot me.

939
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:44,108
Me, too. You can do what you want,
but I'm going in.

940
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,509
This is really serious trouble.

941
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,319
If you're lucky,
you'll just get fired.

942
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:52,358
- Got it.
- This is my last warning.

943
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:02,156
I'm sorry, Sarge. I've got to.

944
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,960
Shit. Wait a minute.

945
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,755
- What's that?
- Looks like East Gate.

946
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,796
Punch it up.

947
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:34,999
Who the hell is that?
Better get Maitland up here.

948
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,879
Where is everybody? ls Rosewood back?

949
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:56,315
- No, sir.
- Seen Taggart?

950
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,595
He took off about 10 minutes ago.

951
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,236
Foley's on the grounds.

952
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:13,677
How the hell should I know?
Get some people out there right away.

953
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,753
Don't take your eyes off that screen.

954
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,435
Try to locate Taggart and Rosewood.

955
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,076
Come on.

956
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:29,950
- They must be away from the car.
- I can see that. Keep trying.

957
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,998
- DD-13, come in please.
- What's their 20?

958
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,592
609 Palm Canyon Road.

959
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,035
Who lives at that address?

960
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,996
A Victor Maitland, sir.

961
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:53,312
- Let's go around.
- Come on, we can do it. Come on.

962
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,988
Ready, one, two...

963
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:03,036
three!

964
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,236
You all right?

965
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,430
What the fuck am I doing here?

966
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,357
Drop it!

967
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:57,035
- Good shot, Billy.
- Let's go.

968
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,999
- Jesus Christ!
- These guys are serious.

969
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,435
I hate machine guns.

970
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:22,870
Cover me.

971
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:38,118
Go around front.
I'm going to check the back.

972
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:44,919
We have a report of shots fired at
that location. 609 Palm Canyon Road.

973
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,719
Put out a 998,
officers need assistance.

974
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,756
- Undercovers on scene.
- Sir?

975
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:54,550
I want all north end units to roll.
South end units stay in their area.

976
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:58,155
- Damn! Let's go.
- Undercover officers at location.

977
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:09,070
Police! You're all under arrest!

978
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:17,628
Do that again, I'll shoot you myself.

979
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,713
Know what I keep thinking about?

980
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,834
Know the end of Butch Cassidy?

981
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:38,196
Redford and Newman
are almost out of ammunition.

982
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:44,319
And the whole Bolivian army
is out in front of this little hut.

983
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,199
I'm going to make you pay for this.

984
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:08,717
- Hanging around?
- Fuck, no.

985
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:37,675
Freeze it! Hold it right there.

986
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:41,829
Shit!

987
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:02,154
Be careful, old boy,
it might hit me.

988
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,272
Freeze!

989
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:31,913
Police! You're all under arrest!

990
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:37,552
Lay down your weapons and take
two steps back with your hands up!

991
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,436
Very good.

992
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:45,509
Great.

993
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,036
What the hell's going on here?

994
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:07,235
Shit.

995
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:11,074
- What's this man doing here?
- Bleeding, sir.

996
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:13,993
How come he isn't wearing cuffs?

997
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:17,117
Well, he isn't actually
in custody, sir.

998
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,839
Place him in custody.
Or would you like me to?

999
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:23,071
Wouldn't you like to hear
my report first, sir?

1000
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:28,035
You have a report
that explains all this?

1001
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:30,395
Yes, sir.

1002
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:33,233
Well, I will be very glad to hear it.

1003
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:39,955
Miss Jeannette Summers, the manager
of Mr Maitland's art gallery,

1004
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:43,635
accidentally discovered
what she suspected was cocaine

1005
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:45,472
in the gallery's warehouse.

1006
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:49,872
She immediately communicated her
discovery to Detective Axel Foley.

1007
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,990
Detective Foley was, at the time,

1008
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:58,790
cooperating in a joint
Beverly Hills-Detroit investigation.

1009
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:03,032
Detectives Foley and Rosewood
proceeded to the warehouse

1010
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:06,829
where Rosewood discovered
approximately 80 kilos of cocaine.

1011
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:12,158
Rosewood called for back-up
and I despatched our officers.

1012
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:15,474
Sergeant Taggart
was the first on the scene.

1013
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:20,677
Believing a felony was in progress,
Sergeant Taggart joined Rosewood,

1014
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:23,832
with Detective Foley present
only as an observer,

1015
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,150
and proceeded to enter the grounds.

1016
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:29,596
In defending ourselves,
we shot several suspects,

1017
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:32,035
including Mr Maitland.

1018
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,159
You expect me to believe that report?

1019
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:42,193
That's the report I'm filing, sir.

1020
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:49,075
Sergeant Taggart,
why don't you tell me what happened?

1021
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,877
Happened just like
the lieutenant said, Chief.

1022
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:20,792
Well, I suppose
congratulations are in order.

1023
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,632
Thank you, sir.

1024
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:27,393
That report better be
on my desk in the morning.

1025
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:29,675
Yes, sir. First thing.

1026
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:39,949
You were lying your ass off.

1027
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:46,431
Go to the hospital
and get your shoulder looked at.

1028
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:49,476
Excuse me, sir.

1029
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:56,474
Could you do me a favour, sir?

1030
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:01,549
- Your favours are all used up.
- I understand.

1031
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:04,598
I just hoped you could
call lnspector Todd

1032
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:07,672
and straighten things out for me,
but that's all right.

1033
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,910
I'm out of a job. It's cool.

1034
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,070
I think I'll stay in Beverly Hills.

1035
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:15,118
I'm going to start
a private investigation company.

1036
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:18,640
I'll talk to Todd first thing.

1037
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,472
- Really?
- You bet.

1038
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:21,515
Thank you so much.

1039
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,273
Hi, I'm Axel Foley
checking out of suite 1035.

1040
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,794
One moment, sir. I'll get your bill.

1041
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:42,828
Guys, you didn't have to come
to see me off, but I'm very moved.

1042
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:46,833
Bogomil ordered us to make sure
you got out of town.

1043
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,470
That doesn't matter. What matters
is that you came down here.

1044
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:54,597
I'm all choked up.
I've got a lump in my throat.

1045
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:57,353
Look a little misty yourself,
Taggart.

1046
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,431
- There you go, sir.
- Thank you.

1047
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:03,354
Excuse me, the Beverly Hills Police
Department is picking that up.

1048
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:07,433
Get outta here.
Guys, that's the last straw.

1049
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,476
You guys are too nice.

1050
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,755
Do you sell those Beverly Palm robes?

1051
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:15,594
- Yes, sir. $95 apiece.
- Put them on my tab.

1052
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:18,877
I have to have two of them, though.

1053
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:22,358
Billy, you saved my life.

1054
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:26,749
I'll never be able to repay you,
but as a token of my appreciation,

1055
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:29,229
I want you to have
this fine Beverly Palm robe.

1056
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:33,632
Each time you get in the shower,
think about our friendship.

1057
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:36,518
Think about Axel Foley.
I love you, Billy.

1058
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:43,150
Thanks, Axel.

1059
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:47,711
Here, let me take this.
You should rest that arm.

1060
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,950
Billy, take care of the tab.

1061
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:52,556
- Taggart...
- Here you are, sir.

1062
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:54,710
This is for you.

1063
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,758
No, that's all right.
You keep it as a souvenir.

1064
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:02,278
I already have three of them
in my bag.

1065
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,238
Thank you, sir.

1066
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:09,754
Not going to say goodbye?

1067
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:12,912
Aren't you tailing me
to the city limits?

1068
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,753
- Yes, we are.
- I figured you would.

1069
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:18,149
I was thinking
about stopping for a drink.

1070
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:21,789
- We figured you would.
- Then will you join me?

1071
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,436
I don't think so, Axel.
We're still on duty.

1072
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:29,671
I don't think

Right. Listen to Taggart. Lighten up.

1074
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,156
One drink's not going to kill us.

1075
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:40,473
But guys, if you fall too far behind,
don't be afraid to honk, OK?

1076
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:44,712
- Where we going, anyway?
- Don't worry, just follow my lead.

1077
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,759
I know the perfect place.
You guys'll love it. Trust me.
