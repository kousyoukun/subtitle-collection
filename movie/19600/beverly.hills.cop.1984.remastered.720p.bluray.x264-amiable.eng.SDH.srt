- Let me see that.

That's about 2,000. Count it yourself.

supposed to be five grand here,

No, they stiffed you,
'cause I want my money, man.

00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:18,213
Well, I'm not some
hot-shot from outta town,

306
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,424
I'm a small reporter from
<i>Rolling Stone Magazine,</i>

307
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,926
that's in town to do an exclusive
interview with Michael Jackson

308
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:25,846
that's gonna be picked up by every
major magazine in the country!

309
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:29,349
I was gonna call the article "Michael
Jackson Is Sitting On Top Of The World,"

310
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:31,101
but now I think I
might well just call it,

311
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:32,853
"Michael Jackson
Can Sit on Top of the World

312
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,938
Just As Long As He Doesn't
Sit in the Beverly Palm Hotel

313
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:36,398
Because There's No Niggers
Allowed in There!"

314
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:40,736
Excuse me, sir, it seems that we
do have a last-minute cancellation.

315
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:44,781
Uh, there is a room available.
It's a suite, but...

316
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,908
I'll only charge
you the single room rate.

317
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,661
Thank you, I'm sorry I got upset.
It's probably from jet lag.

318
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:51,038
- I'm very tired.
- I understand.

319
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:54,291
- What's the rate, anyway?
- That'll be 235 dollars a night, sir.

320
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:00,714
Fine. Fine.

321
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:02,841
And that'll be suite 1035.

322
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:04,301
- Thank you very much.
- Yes, sir.

323
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,553
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

324
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,473
If Michael calls,
tell him what room I'm in.

325
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:10,932
Of course, sir.

326
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:13,477
[♪ Patti LaBelle: <i>Stir It Up</i>]

00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:11,451
[chuckling]

329
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,705
- [man] How you are doing today?
- Hi.

330
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,834
I'm fine, my name is Serge,
and how can I help you?

331
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,045
Uh, yeah, I'm looking
for Miss Jenny Summers.

332
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:24,798
She's very busy today.

333
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:26,341
Maybe you give me your name.

334
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:30,137
- My name's Axel Foley.
- And what it's pertaining?

335
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:31,888
I didn't understand what you said.

336
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:35,225
Pertaining...
What it's meaning... regarding?

337
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:38,061
Oh, what's it regarding?
I'm an old acquaintance of hers.

338
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:41,314
Donny. One moment.

339
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:47,529
Donny, run and tell Ms. Summers
that Mr. Achmed Foley to see her.

340
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:50,282
- No, Axel Foley. Axel.
- Achmel, Achwel?

341
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:51,783
Axel.

342
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,953
Foley's here to see her.
He's a old acquaintance.

343
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,747
- Donny, this is... Cover this up.
- I'm sorry.

344
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:00,834
Like a breast of a dog
to scrub for the customer.

345
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:03,587
- It's not sexy. It's animal.
- No, it's not sexy at all.

346
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:06,923
May I offer you something to drink?
Wine, a cocktail...

347
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,052
- Espresso?
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

348
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:13,471
I make it myself back there
with the little lemon twist.

349
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:16,474
- It's good. You should try it.
- No, I'm... I'm fine.

350
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:18,685
I see you look at this piece.

351
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:21,062
Yeah, I was wondering how much
something like this went for.

352
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:22,856
One hundred and thirty thousand dollar.

353
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:25,108
- Get the fuck outta here!
- No! No, I cannot.

354
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:27,861
It's serious, because
it's very important piece.

355
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:30,655
- Have you ever sold one of these?
- Sell it yesterday to a collector.

356
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:33,825
- Get the fuck outta here!
- No, I'm serious! I sell it myself.

357
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:37,078
Axel Foley, what on earth
are you doing here?

358
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:38,288
How you doin'?

359
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:40,916
I'm fine! Hold a second,
I'll be right down.

360
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:43,126
Great, excuse me, Serge.

361
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:47,130
- What are you doing here?
- [Axel] How you doin'?

362
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:50,258
- Oh, God, it's good to see you.
- Same here.

363
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:52,093
- How have you been?
- I been... Look at you!

364
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,637
- You like?
- Yes!

365
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:55,138
- Is it good?
- You gettin' old.

366
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:56,973
- Fuck you.
- [both laugh]

367
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,642
- What is this?
- A moustache.

368
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:01,228
- Peach fuzz.
- No, that's man style now.

369
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,104
[laughing]

370
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:05,106
You have some place
where we can talk real quick?

371
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:07,442
Well, yeah. Right over there.

372
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:08,985
- Great.
- Come on.

373
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:11,488
- I can't believe how you filled out.
- Yeah, I filled out.

374
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:14,324
No, it looks good though.
Sit down.

375
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:18,995
I wanna talk to you about Mikey.

376
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:21,206
Oh, is he in trouble again?

377
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:25,627
He's dead.

378
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:29,297
What?

379
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:33,260
He's dead. He came to Detroit
and somebody killed him.

380
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:39,266
- I don't believe this.
- [phone ringing]

381
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:51,528
Look, I can't right now.
I'll be up in a second.

382
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:57,075
Mikey mentioned that you
helped him get a job.

383
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:00,287
Yeah...

384
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:05,041
The guy who owns this gallery
hired him as a favor to me.

385
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,043
Who's this guy?

386
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,838
His name is Victor Maitland.

387
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:13,591
He was working for Victor
at the gallery's warehouse.

388
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:17,137
Look, Axel, I can't talk right now,
I have to go upstairs.

389
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:18,888
That's cool.

390
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:23,184
I'll call you later on, and we'll
get together later and talk, OK?

391
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:24,686
Sure.

392
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:27,647
Be good.

393
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:38,074
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

394
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:41,703
- I have a delivery for Victor Maitland.
- I'll take it right upstairs to him.

395
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,747
Maybe I should give it to him myself.

396
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:46,124
Well, deliveries are
supposed to be left on my desk.

397
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,209
Yeah, but he has to get
these flowers, it's imperative.

398
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:49,586
I'm gonna go up myself, all right?

399
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:52,547
- You're not really supposed to go up.
- Floral delivery is my life.

400
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,424
I have to take it up. Thank you.

401
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,843
- Who let you in here?
- I let myself in.

402
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,303
How you doin'?

403
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:01,514
I have to ask you some questions
about Michael Tandino.

404
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,060
[Victor] Speak to you later, darling.

405
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:12,275
And what, may I ask,
is your interest in Mr. Tandino?

406
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:13,818
He was my best friend.

407
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:16,112
He came to see me in Detroit
a couple of days ago.

408
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,698
And a couple of hours after he
got there, someone killed him.

409
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:22,118
Oh, my God! That's terrible!

410
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:24,204
It's fucked up.

411
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:29,125
And? What do you wish to know?

412
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:31,711
He worked for you, didn't he?

413
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:35,382
Yes, yes, he did. Good gracious.

414
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,593
I'm really sorry to hear this.

415
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,888
Would you like to sit down?
Can I get you anything?

416
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:43,973
No, I'm all right.

417
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,310
Well, how on earth did this happen?

418
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:50,563
Detroit is a very violent city,
isn't it?

419
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,734
Yeah, it is.

420
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:59,697
Well, I do hope the police
have procured some intelligent leads.

421
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:04,327
Exactly what was it
Mikey did for you here?

422
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:08,832
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

423
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:10,667
My name is Foley.

424
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:14,671
Well, excuse me, Mr. Foley,
if I appear a little rude,

425
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:19,509
but this sounds like something
for the authorities in Detroit.

426
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:23,304
So, if you'll forgive me,
I really must get back to work.

427
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:24,889
Look, all I want to know is what kind...

428
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:27,851
Gentlemen, would you please
show Mr. Foley to the door?

429
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:29,352
- Get the fuck off me.
- Hey, take it easy.

430
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,188
Yo, man, get the fuck off me.
Get off me, man! Get off me!

431
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:35,191
- Get the fuck off me! Get off!
- [door slams]

432
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:37,610
- [elevator dings]
- [Axel] Get the fuck off me, man.

433
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:39,195
Get off me!

434
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:42,532
Get the fuck off me!

435
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:45,160
You think I'm playin' games, man? Hey!

436
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,494
I'm fuckin' somebody up.

437
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:53,751
Hey!

438
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:58,298
- What the fuck is this shit?
- [police siren approaching]

439
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:04,721
Did you see that shit?
I can describe all of them.

440
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:07,390
Please move to the side of the car
and put your hands on the hood.

441
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:08,683
Why, what's with you guys?

442
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,269
You heard what he said, sir.
Do it right now, please.

443
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:14,814
What kind of shit is this, man?
Hold up, wait a second.

444
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:18,401
You guys are arrestin' me for gettin'
thrown out of a fuckin' window?!

445
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:20,945
I got thrown out of a window, man!

446
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:23,323
Gun, partner!

447
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,035
Sir, you are under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

448
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:29,996
Anything you say can, and will be
used against you in a court of law.

449
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:32,415
You have the right to have an attorney
present during questioning.

450
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:34,876
Yeah, I understand.
I understand the rights.

451
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:37,712
I know this is bullshit though.
I got thrown out of a fuckin' window!

452
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:40,507
- Please get in the car, sir.
- Tell me somethin', what's the charge?

453
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:43,426
Possession of a concealed weapon,
disturbing the peace.

454
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:46,262
Disturbing the peace?
I got thrown out of a window!

455
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:48,932
What's the fuckin' charge for gettin'
pushed out of a movin' car, huh?

456
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:51,267
Jaywalking? This is bullshit!

457
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:00,902
You know, this is the cleanest
and nicest police car

458
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:03,196
I've ever been in in my life.

459
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:04,948
This thing's nicer than my apartment.

460
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:12,622
[Axel] Officers, if we see any like...
movie stars, could y'all stop

461
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:15,124
and point them out,
I never seen no shit like that.

462
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:17,961
- That's enough talkin', pal.
- OK, that's cool.

463
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:28,471
This is nice.

464
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:34,394
Well, it's about time.

465
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,729
Thought you forgot I was down here.
I was gettin' hungry.

466
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:38,856
I never been in no cell
that had a phone in it.

467
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:41,651
Can I stay for awhile,
'cause I ordered some pizza?

468
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,073
Somebody'd eat it.

469
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:50,910
[indistinct chatter]

470
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:10,013
Have a seat right over there, please.

471
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:20,523
I'm Sergeant Taggart and this is
my partner, Detective Rosewood.

472
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:24,193
You always treat visitors
from out of town like this?

473
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:30,867
Why didn't you identify yourself as a
police officer when you were arrested?

474
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:34,120
'Cause I was mindin' my own business.
Where the fuck do you guys get off

475
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:36,205
arrestin' somebody for gettin'
thrown out of a window?

476
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:38,625
We have six witnesses
that say you broke in

477
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:41,461
and started tearin' up the place,
then jumped out the window!

478
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:45,298
And you guys believed that? What
the fuck are you, cops or doormen?

479
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:48,926
We're more likely to believe
an important local businessman,

480
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:51,095
than a foul-mouthed jerk
from out of town!

481
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:53,598
Foul-mouthed? Fuck you, man.

482
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:57,560
- Hey, Sarg.
- You watch your mouth.

483
00:32:57,727 --> 00:32:59,729
Don't square off on me
with some bullshit.

484
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:01,606
- You want to start some static?
- Don't push me!

485
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:03,733
- Fuck you, man.
- [grunts]

486
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,026
Taggart!

487
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:08,071
Yes, sir?

488
00:33:09,197 --> 00:33:10,239
Come here.

489
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:17,080
[indistinct murmuring]

490
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:28,007
Sir...

491
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:31,094
I apologize for striking you.

492
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:34,305
I have no excuse.

493
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:39,102
Forget about it.

494
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:44,107
Detective Foley, I'm Lieutenant Bogomil,
of the Beverly Hills Police Department.

495
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:46,275
Do you wish to file charges
against Sergeant Taggart?

496
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,405
This is some kind of joke, right?

497
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:54,701
Do you wish to file charges
against this officer for assault?

498
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:58,496
Look, where I'm from, cops don't
file charges against other cops.

499
00:33:59,372 --> 00:34:02,125
No, I don't wanna do that.

500
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,877
Well, in Beverly Hills,
we go strictly by the book.

501
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:09,173
Now, why didn't you inform us
when you came to town?

502
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,926
- I'm on vacation.
- Well, if you're on vacation,

503
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:14,554
what business did you have
in Victor Maitland's office?

504
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:15,847
I had to go to the bathroom.

505
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:18,266
I was walkin' by, it looked like
a nice clean place, so I stopped.

506
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:22,812
You always take your gun on vacation?

507
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:25,606
I don't know,
I never been on vacation before.

508
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:28,818
But in Detroit, cops are required
to carry a firearm at all times.

509
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:31,446
Well, if you wanna carry a gun,
I suggest you go back there.

510
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:34,198
I really can't wait to get back there,
if you wanna know the truth.

511
00:34:34,365 --> 00:34:35,491
Is that so?

512
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:37,994
I just got off the phone
with an Inspector Todd in Detroit.

513
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:40,121
Does that name ring a bell?

514
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:43,833
He's my boss.

515
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,919
He tells me you might not
be very welcome back there.

516
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:51,674
He says that you're
an outstanding young detective.

517
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:54,343
I find that very difficult to believe.

518
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,720
But it's true, though.

519
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:58,514
He also says they nearly had
to fire you for insubordination.

520
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:01,392
I find that very easy to believe.

521
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,187
Now, what are you doing
in Beverly Hills?

522
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:06,689
I told you, I'm on vacation.
I went to the bathroom,

523
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:09,192
the next thing I knew six guys
threw me out a window.

524
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:12,528
Inspector Todd gave me
a message for you, wanna hear it?

525
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:14,614
I don't think so.

526
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:17,408
He says if you're out here
investigating the Tandino murder,

527
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:19,869
you needn't bother coming back.

528
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:22,955
He tells me that if we inform him
you are working on this case,

529
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:25,958
he'll have you brought up
on charges and fired.

530
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:29,253
Now, one last time,
what are you doing...

531
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,965
- I'm on vacation!
- Vacation! Vacation.

532
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:38,721
Rosewood, take Mr. Foley over to the
courthouse and let him arrange for bail.

533
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:41,265
Would you follow me, sir?

534
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:46,020
You know, I gotta hand it to you guys,
if anything you are extremely polite.

535
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,899
Pretty good punch
you got there, Taggart.

536
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:55,822
[Axel] After you.

537
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,741
After you.

538
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:02,119
You guys are so sweet, you know that?

539
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,206
Thanks for bailin' me out, Jen.

540
00:36:05,373 --> 00:36:08,417
If I'd known why you'd been arrested,
I wouldn't have come.

541
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:10,753
[chuckling] Oh, you don't mean that.

542
00:36:11,546 --> 00:36:13,214
No, I don't mean that.

543
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:17,051
Axel, if it wasn't for Victor Maitland,
I'd be waiting on tables!

544
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:19,262
It just so happens
that the day Mikey got killed,

545
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:22,390
he showed up at my apartment
with a bag of German bearer bonds.

546
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:24,725
I think he stole 'em
from whoever had him killed.

547
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:26,143
When I mentioned Mikey's name,

548
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,937
Maitland went nuts
and had me thrown out.

549
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:29,647
Axel, you look like a hoodlum.

550
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:32,483
You go barging into his office
without an appointment.

551
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,776
You're carrying a gun.

552
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:37,113
If you barged into my office and
I didn't know you, I'd throw you out.

553
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,614
Is this your car?

554
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:41,951
Oh, no, in Beverly Hills we just
take whichever car's closest.

555
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:46,289
I remember you used to drive
that crappy, blue Chevy Nova.

556
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:49,125
What are you driving now?

557
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,879
- The same crappy, blue Chevy Nova.
- [laughing]

558
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:54,463
You think it's too late
for me to study art?

559
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,882
Yeah, I do.

560
00:36:56,674 --> 00:36:59,844
Axel, why were you bothering Victor?

561
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:02,305
You don't think he has anything to do
with Mikey getting killed?

562
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:06,851
Oh, no. No, I was just pokin' around,
I don't think he did nothin'.

563
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:10,438
Axel, Victor Maitland
is one of the top art dealers

564
00:37:10,605 --> 00:37:13,399
in the United States.
He has been for ten years.

565
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:15,109
I'm impressed.

566
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:23,993
- What are you looking back there for?
- The cops, they're following us.

567
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,704
What? Where?

568
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:31,000
In the back on the right.
The beige Ford.

569
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,030
Can you believe this place?

570
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:04,450
Axel, how can you afford this?

571
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:06,702
They're only charging me
the single room rate.

572
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:08,037
How can you afford that?

573
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:11,165
Actually I can't afford it. But you know
what they got inside that bathroom?

574
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:14,251
They got little robes,
with little initials of the hotel on it.

575
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,545
I love this place,
I can't leave this shit.

576
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,047
I'm gonna steal one of them robes.

577
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:19,423
- You want one?
- No, thanks.

578
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,758
- You want slippers?
- No.

579
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:23,386
I'm gonna steal them, too.
You should take some of this shit.

580
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:25,179
Excuse me two seconds.

581
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:29,725
Hello, room service?

582
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:33,896
Yes, this is Mr. Axel Foley
in suite 1035. Yeah.

583
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:36,399
I'd like to order something
from your late supper menu.

584
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:39,777
But listen, I want you to deliver it to
this beige Ford parked out on Wilshire.

585
00:38:39,944 --> 00:38:44,031
Send down one
bay shrimp salad sandwich, OK?

586
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:48,869
Right, and is the cold poached
salmon in dill sauce tasty?

587
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:50,997
OK, send one of those down, all right?

588
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:53,582
And send down something for dessert.
Thank you very much.

589
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:55,251
All right, thank you.

590
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:58,045
You're quite a sport.

591
00:38:58,212 --> 00:38:59,880
How long are you gonna stay?

592
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:03,467
I'm gonna be in town
until I find out who killed Mikey.

593
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:08,889
And I'm very seriously considering
going down to that warehouse

594
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,933
where he worked
and checkin' that place out.

595
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,437
Oh, really?
And how are you planning on getting in?

596
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:16,522
[both chuckling]

597
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:37,001
- Good evening, sir.
- What the hell is that?

598
00:39:37,168 --> 00:39:39,628
It's late supper, sir,
compliments of Axel Foley.

599
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:43,299
Foley? How did he know we were here?

600
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:44,967
'Cause I let you drive.

601
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:46,927
I need a couple bananas,
how much are they?

602
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,305
Well, the buffet plate is $12.50.

603
00:39:49,472 --> 00:39:52,808
You get peaches, plums,
oranges and bananas.

604
00:39:52,975 --> 00:39:54,769
All I need is a couple of bananas.

605
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,443
Shh. Go ahead, take those bananas.

606
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:04,361
Thanks.

607
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:08,074
Forget it, I'm not eatin' that.
Take it back.

608
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,576
- [man] Certainly, sir.
- This really looks great.

609
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:26,425
Can I get some extra mayo?

610
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:27,927
- Certainly, sir.
- Thank you.

611
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,805
- [Axel] Ready to go?
- [Jenny] Yeah.

612
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:34,683
There's the Mercedes.
Will you get rid of that stuff?

613
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:50,407
[car sputters, stalls]

614
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:51,951
[Taggart] What the hell are you doing?

615
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:53,869
[engine turning over]

616
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:05,381
This the place?

617
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:08,592
Yeah, but I'm still not sure
I should do this.

618
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:10,052
OK, you don't have to do anything.

619
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:12,054
But when you hear glass
and shit breaking,

620
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:15,599
don't get scared, it's just me
kickin' in the window. Sit tight.

621
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:17,017
[Jenny laughing]

622
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:19,353
All right, come on, Axel.

623
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:43,794
What's happenin', baby?

624
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:45,713
[laughing] Axel, grow up.

625
00:41:58,893 --> 00:41:59,977
[sniffs]

626
00:42:00,144 --> 00:42:02,313
- You find something?
- Coffee grounds.

627
00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:04,607
So?

628
00:42:05,816 --> 00:42:07,651
You know what this stuff is used for?

629
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:10,446
Yes, some people filter hot water
through it and drink it.

630
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:12,281
Yeah, I'm gonna take this home
and filter hot water through it

631
00:42:12,448 --> 00:42:13,699
and drink it in the mornin'.

632
00:42:13,866 --> 00:42:15,784
- [laughs]
- [mimics laugh]

633
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:17,828
[both laughing]

634
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:30,382
- [whispers] What are we hiding for?
- Shh.

635
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,594
I tell you, I wish you'd been
with me last night.

636
00:42:34,887 --> 00:42:35,888
[man] What happened?

637
00:42:36,055 --> 00:42:38,891
[man 2] I stopped at a joint on the way
home to have a couple of drinks.

638
00:42:39,058 --> 00:42:41,894
- [man] Yeah. Which one?
- [man 2] One of the local joints.

639
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:45,648
This guy comes in, he sits down
a couple of stools away.

640
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:49,777
He's got one of them eyes
that's goin' like this.

641
00:42:49,944 --> 00:42:53,113
I didn't know if he was tryin'
to put the make on me, or what.

642
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,032
So I thought I'd take you
over there tonight.

643
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:58,202
Let him have a little shot at you
before I tore his head off.

644
00:43:08,796 --> 00:43:11,090
[sighs] Come on, let's go,
I wanna get outta here.

645
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:13,676
Why don't you get off my back.

646
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:14,927
Come on.

647
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:20,391
I got it.

648
00:43:37,408 --> 00:43:39,868
- Axel, what the hell's going on?
- I'll tell you later, come on.

649
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:43,122
- Hurry up.
- "Hurry up."

650
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:46,083
- Gimme the key, I'm gonna follow 'em.
- You ever driven a Mercedes before?

651
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,544
No, but a car is a car.
I drive my car everyday.

652
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:50,504
I'm driving, I've seen your car.

653
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:52,840
Oh, shit, that's cold.

654
00:43:53,966 --> 00:43:55,676
[car starts]

655
00:43:57,011 --> 00:43:58,846
[brakes squeal]

656
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:01,890
A banana in your tailpipe!

657
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:04,893
How could you not notice a man
sticking a banana in your tailpipe?

658
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,104
- He distracted us, sir.
- And how'd he do that?

659
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:10,899
He sent us a late supper, sir.
See, this waiter comes over...

660
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:13,068
Billy, he gets the point.

661
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:15,112
A late supper.

662
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:17,698
And what did you have, Rosewood?

663
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:23,579
I think it was a shrimp
salad sandwich, sir.

664
00:44:23,746 --> 00:44:26,749
- A shrimp salad sandwich.
- Yes, sir.

665
00:44:30,044 --> 00:44:33,464
I want you two to go back to the hotel
and wait for Foley to show up.

666
00:44:34,173 --> 00:44:37,926
And if you lose him again,
don't bother calling in. You got that?

667
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:40,429
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

668
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:43,599
"A late supper."

669
00:44:45,726 --> 00:44:47,519
We've got something for you, Billy.

670
00:44:49,146 --> 00:44:51,273
An anti-banana disguise.

671
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:56,570
It may come in handy.

672
00:44:56,737 --> 00:44:58,906
A little extra protection, Billy.

673
00:44:59,073 --> 00:45:00,407
[chuckling]

674
00:45:00,574 --> 00:45:02,076
Very funny.

675
00:45:04,036 --> 00:45:06,747
[sighs] Come on, Billy, let's go.

676
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:23,305
Why don't you take the car
and go on home?

677
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:27,476
- Well, what about you?
- I wanna find out what this place is.

678
00:45:27,643 --> 00:45:30,270
[Jenny] Oh, I can tell you that.
It's a bonded warehouse.

679
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:33,482
They hold our foreign shipments here
until they clear Customs.

680
00:45:33,649 --> 00:45:36,235
Well, I'm gonna go check it out.
Just take the car and go home, OK?

681
00:45:36,402 --> 00:45:40,322
Damn it, Axel!
I'm not gonna bail you out again.

682
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:41,657
Go home.

683
00:46:38,714 --> 00:46:41,884
How you doin'? Could you come here
for a second, please?

684
00:46:43,552 --> 00:46:46,305
- Hi, do you have a match?
- There's no smoking in here.

685
00:46:46,472 --> 00:46:48,390
I'm not gonna smoke now,
I'm gonna smoke when I go outside.

686
00:46:48,557 --> 00:46:50,225
Thank you very much. Thank you.

687
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:52,811
- Is your supervisor here?
- Yeah, he's in the office.

688
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:54,855
- Can you get him for me?
- What's the problem?

689
00:46:55,022 --> 00:46:56,064
- You security here?
- Yeah.

690
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:59,610
Then you're the fuckin' problem,
go get your supervisor, please. Now!

691
00:47:00,402 --> 00:47:02,529
- Now!
- OK.

692
00:47:09,912 --> 00:47:11,371
He didn't come back yet.

693
00:47:12,581 --> 00:47:14,291
[sighs]

694
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:16,502
Well, what do we do now?

695
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:18,921
We wait.

696
00:47:22,508 --> 00:47:23,550
OK.

697
00:47:23,717 --> 00:47:26,303
- Can I help you?
- Are you the supervisor here?

698
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:27,429
Yes, who are you?

699
00:47:27,596 --> 00:47:29,932
I'm Inspector Rafferty,
United States Customs Service.

700
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:32,267
Has all this stuff
passed through Customs already?

701
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:33,602
No, this is the bonded area.

702
00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:35,521
Then tell me something.
Answer a question.

703
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:38,774
How can a black man, dressed like me,
just march into your warehouse,

704
00:47:38,941 --> 00:47:40,609
walk into the bonded area
and start poking around

705
00:47:40,776 --> 00:47:43,111
without anyone askin' me
any questions whatsoever?

706
00:47:44,196 --> 00:47:45,531
Well, I don't know.

707
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:47,407
Thank you, that's the answer
I was lookin' for.

708
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:50,452
Just give me your ID numbers,
'cause somebody's gonna lose their job.

709
00:47:50,619 --> 00:47:52,704
This guy gave me a match,
for Christ's sake.

710
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:54,122
You gave him a match?

711
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:57,960
Listen to me. I do security checks
all over the nation,

712
00:47:58,126 --> 00:47:59,836
and with the exception of Cleveland,

713
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:03,298
this place has the worst security
in the nation!

714
00:48:03,465 --> 00:48:06,218
I suggest you call your wives,
'cause we're gonna be here all night.

715
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:09,846
We're gonna check the background
of each and every crate in this section,

716
00:48:10,013 --> 00:48:11,848
starting with this one, right here!

717
00:48:12,474 --> 00:48:14,309
Wow.

718
00:48:14,476 --> 00:48:18,981
You know, it says here that by the
time the average American is 50,

719
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:23,110
he's got five pounds
of undigested red meat in his bowels.

720
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:26,613
Why are you telling me this?

721
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,616
What makes you think
I have any interest in that at all?

722
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,246
Well, you eat a lot of red meat.

723
00:48:35,414 --> 00:48:37,249
Now, the inspector needs
all the information

724
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:39,835
- on those airway bill numbers.
- All the manifests, too.

725
00:48:40,002 --> 00:48:42,045
That's right, and he needs
the records of all shipments

726
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:43,672
- due into the same destination.
- Right.

727
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,966
- What's this all about?
- Just do it!

728
00:48:46,133 --> 00:48:48,135
You got some kind of warrant for this?

729
00:48:49,303 --> 00:48:52,723
You know, you have a very big mouth.
Are you hiding something from me?

730
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:57,227
I bet that's your Porsche that's parked
outside. Isn't that your Porsche?

731
00:48:57,394 --> 00:48:59,313
How would you like for me
to have the IRS come down here

732
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:01,773
and crawl up your fuckin' ass with
a microscope? 'Cause they'll do it!

733
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,859
I've seen 'em do it!
It's not a pretty sight!

734
00:49:04,026 --> 00:49:06,570
I want you to know somethin', pal.
I want all y'all to know somethin'.

735
00:49:06,737 --> 00:49:09,531
I can have 25 agents down here
in 15 minutes,

736
00:49:09,698 --> 00:49:12,242
to march in here,
snatch up bonds from underneath you

737
00:49:12,409 --> 00:49:14,286
and you guys'll be
out of business permanently

738
00:49:14,453 --> 00:49:16,455
if I don't get some cooperation!
Is that understood?

739
00:49:16,622 --> 00:49:19,708
Don't get upset, we'll give
you everything you need. Right, guys?

740
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:22,085
- Everything you need.
- That's not my Porsche.

741
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:24,630
- I don't know whose it is.
- You ain't got nothin' to worry about.

742
00:49:24,796 --> 00:49:27,382
I don't know what you all think I am,
take me for some kind of fool.

743
00:49:27,549 --> 00:49:28,425
Hurry up! Quicker!

744
00:49:34,097 --> 00:49:37,059
You know, I noticed you've been
drinking a lot of coffee lately.

745
00:49:39,895 --> 00:49:42,606
Well, I think that's why you
have a hard time relaxing.

746
00:49:47,277 --> 00:49:48,654
[car door shuts]

747
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:02,376
Ha-ha-haa!

748
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:04,127
Jesus Christ!

749
00:50:05,671 --> 00:50:07,506
You almost gave me a heart attack.

750
00:50:07,673 --> 00:50:09,216
What are you guys doin' here so late?

751
00:50:09,383 --> 00:50:11,593
You're a cocky son of a bitch,
aren't you?

752
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,846
Look, if you're still mad about
the banana thing, I'm sorry.

753
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:16,765
- Just needed a little time to myself.
- Yeah.

754
00:50:16,932 --> 00:50:20,727
Just wish I would've saw the expression
on your face when the car konked out.

755
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:23,689
Yeah, very funny.
Lieutenant docked us two days' pay.

756
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:26,024
Get outta here!

757
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:31,321
- He's not kidding.
- No, he's not kidding.

758
00:50:33,115 --> 00:50:35,784
By the way, thanks for the sandwich.

759
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:38,453
He meant it as a joke, Billy,
like the bananas.

760
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,579
[Axel] Hey, wait a minute.

761
00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:42,457
I'm a fellow police officer, I know
what it's like to be on a stakeout.

762
00:50:42,624 --> 00:50:44,793
When I sent that food down,
that was from the heart.

763
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,044
Bullshit!

764
00:50:47,295 --> 00:50:49,089
Why are we always arguing, man?

765
00:50:49,256 --> 00:50:51,425
All three of us are cops,
we should be workin' together.

766
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:53,760
We all had a very rough day today.

767
00:50:53,927 --> 00:50:56,596
What do you say,
we all go get something to drink

768
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:58,598
and make up and be friends, huh?

769
00:50:59,433 --> 00:51:00,809
Forget it.

770
00:51:01,852 --> 00:51:04,563
OK, fuck it. I'm gonna
get somethin' to drink, all right?

771
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:06,898
You guys can try to follow me
if you want to do that,

772
00:51:07,065 --> 00:51:09,818
but I lost y'all once today,
which means I can do this shit again.

773
00:51:09,985 --> 00:51:11,903
Why don't we just go get
somethin' to drink together?

774
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:15,073
- Let's be friends.
- We don't drink on duty.

775
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,285
OK, fine, all right, but listen to me.

776
00:51:18,452 --> 00:51:20,829
I found the perfect place.

777
00:51:20,996 --> 00:51:23,081
I saw it on the way over here.
It's perfect for you guys.

778
00:51:23,248 --> 00:51:25,751
You can go, it's very conservative,
and you guys'll love it.

779
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:28,503
Don't worry, it's nice. Trust me.

[♪ Vanity 6: <i>Nasty Girl</i>]

781

[woman] Hi, can I get you something?

782
00:51:54,654 --> 00:51:57,699
Yes! I'm havin' a great time.
Can I have a Scotch and soda?

783
00:51:57,866 --> 00:52:01,036
And the brothers... What y'all want,
like, light beers for the fellas.

784
00:52:01,203 --> 00:52:02,537
Two club sodas.

You guys crack me up,
with this "on duty" shit.

Billy! Billy.

You don't have to be embarrassed
if your dick gets hard.

788
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,051
It's a dick, it's supposed to get hard.
That's the whole object of this.

789
00:52:16,218 --> 00:52:19,137
Taggart's dick gets hard, but he won't
let you know, 'cause he's the boss.

790
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:21,223
Boss's dick got to stay limp, right?

791
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:23,767
I ain't on duty, so my dick can be hard.

792

[chuckling] Hey, Taggart, look.

793

Check that out, I found that
at Maitland's warehouse.

Billy! Bill, here, give her this.

Really, stuff that inside her
little thing and she'll go nuts.

Excuse me.

- Yeah!
- So?

800
00:52:47,916 --> 00:52:50,418
You guys don't know nothin'
about nothin', do you?

801
00:52:50,585 --> 00:52:52,754
Just got your badges and your guns
and you're on the job, right?

802
00:52:52,921 --> 00:52:56,591
Make sure we get the right drinks.

Thank you very much.

Taggart, see that guy
over there in the black coat?

807
00:53:33,962 --> 00:53:35,505
Black jacket?

- Yeah?
- Well, it's June.

809
00:53:38,425 --> 00:53:41,261
Don't you think it's kind of hot
for a long, black leather coat?

810
00:53:41,428 --> 00:53:42,637
Yeah, a little bit.

811
00:53:42,804 --> 00:53:46,266
Yeah. Look at his partner over there.
They just came in together.

Why don't you go over there
and cover that guy for me, all right?

Will somebody tell me what's going on?

No bullshit this time.

He told me it wasn't.

Said you don't come here no more,
but I said, "It's Phil!"

- Get outta here, man.
- I told you it's Philip, you liar!

What's all the hostility?

Way to go, Rosewood.
You're some kind of cop, you know that?

Sorry for the disturbance, folks.
Everything's under control.

00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:48,596
Taggart!

841
00:55:50,515 --> 00:55:52,600
Would you mind explaining to me
what you and Rosewood

842
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:55,603
were doing in a strip bar
out of our jurisdiction,

843
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,230
when you were still on duty?

844
00:55:57,397 --> 00:55:59,441
Sir, before you chastise
these two officers,

845
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:01,234
I think there's something
you should know.

846
00:56:01,401 --> 00:56:04,112
The only reason that they
were at a strip bar

847
00:56:04,279 --> 00:56:06,740
was because they were tailing me
and I went to this place.

848
00:56:06,906 --> 00:56:09,784
Now, these two officers were sitting
outside wondering what I was doing.

849
00:56:09,951 --> 00:56:12,704
I was in havin' a good time,
I'm into things like that.

850
00:56:12,871 --> 00:56:15,498
Anyway, these guys waited outside,

851
00:56:15,665 --> 00:56:17,459
and the only reason
that they came in

852
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:19,794
was because they saw
two suspicious-looking gentlemen,

853
00:56:19,961 --> 00:56:22,464
with bulges in their jackets,
going into the place.

854
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:25,884
Well, it turns out that these guys were
gonna commit a robbery, sir.

855
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:28,595
These men watched them,
waited for them to make their move

856
00:56:28,762 --> 00:56:30,430
and then they foiled the crime.

857
00:56:30,597 --> 00:56:33,892
I did not know what was goin' on.
I was watchin' the show, havin' fun.

858
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:36,561
I'm still freaked out by it.
They must have a sixth sense or...

859
00:56:36,728 --> 00:56:41,441
I don't know what you teach these
fellows, but they're not regular cops.

860
00:56:41,608 --> 00:56:42,692
They're super cops.

861
00:56:42,859 --> 00:56:45,779
And the only thing missing
on these guys are capes.

862
00:56:49,866 --> 00:56:51,659
Is this what really happened?

863
00:56:54,162 --> 00:56:55,663
No, sir.

864
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:59,000
Would someone like to tell me
what really happened?

865
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:02,420
[clears throat] Well...

866
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:07,008
Foley invited us to this bar...
and we accepted.

867
00:57:07,175 --> 00:57:09,344
We ordered club soda, sir.

868
00:57:09,511 --> 00:57:13,139
Right. And while we were there...

869
00:57:14,015 --> 00:57:18,103
...Foley observed the two suspects
casing the establishment.

870
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:20,772
And before we knew
what was going on...

871
00:57:21,815 --> 00:57:23,983
...he'd already disarmed one of them.

872
00:57:25,485 --> 00:57:30,073
Detective Foley deserves
all the credit for the arrest, sir.

873
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,202
Detective Foley,
we appreciate your assistance.

874
00:57:34,828 --> 00:57:37,455
But in the future, if you want
to practice law enforcement,

875
00:57:37,622 --> 00:57:40,208
I would prefer you did it in Detroit.

876
00:57:41,626 --> 00:57:43,169
I understand, sir. I'm sorry.

877
00:57:43,336 --> 00:57:46,381
But before I go I just want you
two to know something, all right?

878
00:57:46,548 --> 00:57:49,592
The super cop story was working.

879
00:57:50,385 --> 00:57:54,013
OK? It was working
and you guys messed it up.

880
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:58,726
OK? I'm tryin' to figure
you guys out, but I haven't yet.

881
00:57:58,893 --> 00:58:00,228
But it's cool.

882
00:58:00,395 --> 00:58:03,148
You fuck up a perfectly
good lie and it's all right.

883
00:58:09,696 --> 00:58:12,907
You guys are off the case.

884
00:58:13,074 --> 00:58:16,828
Foster. McCabe. Your turn.

885
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:19,247
Don't lose him.

886
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:21,958
Not a chance, sir.

887
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:27,422
And you two... in my office.

888
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:33,720
[mouthing] Well? Go on.

889
00:58:46,107 --> 00:58:48,610
Morning, gentlemen.
Some coffee and donuts?

890
00:58:49,444 --> 00:58:51,696
- What?
- Coffee and donuts.

892
00:58:57,869 --> 00:58:59,120
There he is.

893

[car door shuts]

894
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,973
Morning, officers.
What you all, the second team?

895
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:21,559
We're the first team.

896
00:59:21,726 --> 00:59:24,812
Yeah. We're not gonna fall
for a banana in the tailpipe.

897
00:59:24,979 --> 00:59:27,857
[mocking] "You're not going to fall
for the banana in the tailpipe?"

898
00:59:28,024 --> 00:59:30,568
It should be more natural, brother,
it should flow out, like this:

899
00:59:30,735 --> 00:59:33,488
[forcefully] "Look man, I ain't fallin'
for no banana in my tailpipe!"

900
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:35,240
See, that's more natural for us.

901
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:36,991
You been hangin' out
with this dude too long.

902
00:59:39,327 --> 00:59:40,370
[chuckling]

903
00:59:40,536 --> 00:59:43,915
I'm sorry, I'm just fuckin' with you.
That's funny to me. Sorry.

904
00:59:44,082 --> 00:59:46,125
So, y'all gonna try and keep up with me?

905
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:49,671
- No problem.
- Isn't this Victor Maitland's house?

906
00:59:49,837 --> 00:59:51,506
Yeah, I think so.

907
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,509
[sighs]

908
00:59:54,676 --> 00:59:56,177
Well, I seen enough.

909
00:59:56,344 --> 00:59:58,012
Y'all want somethin' to drink?
A beer or somethin'?

910
00:59:58,179 --> 01:00:00,682
I got some stuff in the trunk.
Excuse me.

911
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,321
For a man who claims to be on vacation,

912
01:00:15,488 --> 01:00:17,031
you look a lot like
you're on a stakeout.

913
01:00:17,198 --> 01:00:21,577
Stakeout? No, no, I'm picnicking.
This is like a picnic area.

914
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:32,046
Well, guys, I been
shootin' the shit long enough.

915
01:00:32,213 --> 01:00:34,882
Time for me to take in some sights.
Excuse me.

916
01:00:51,858 --> 01:00:53,735
[tires screeching]

917
01:01:27,602 --> 01:01:29,228
What the hell's he doing?

918
01:01:30,855 --> 01:01:32,607
[tires squealing]

919
01:01:39,739 --> 01:01:41,908
[laughing]

920
01:02:28,162 --> 01:02:29,914
Can you put this in a good spot?

921
01:02:30,081 --> 01:02:33,167
All this shit happened the last time
I parked here. Thank you.

922
01:03:01,362 --> 01:03:02,488
May I help you?

923
01:03:03,739 --> 01:03:06,409
[effeminate] Yes, I'm looking
for Victor Maitland.

924
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:10,204
You realize that this is
a members-only club?

925
01:03:10,371 --> 01:03:13,040
Mm-hm, but I have to talk to Victor,
it's very, very important.

926
01:03:13,207 --> 01:03:15,334
Are you sure it's
Victor Maitland you want?

927
01:03:15,501 --> 01:03:20,089
Oh, yes, the grey haired gentleman,
very dark skin, Capricorn. Victor.

928
01:03:20,965 --> 01:03:24,510
Well, why don't you give me
the message and I'll take it to him.

929
01:03:24,677 --> 01:03:26,387
OK, I guess I can do that.

930
01:03:26,554 --> 01:03:29,682
Tell Victor that Ramon,
the fella he met about a week ago,

931
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:32,477
tell him that Ramon
went to the clinic today

932
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:35,563
and I found out that I have...

933
01:03:36,481 --> 01:03:38,065
...Herpes symplex ten.

934
01:03:38,232 --> 01:03:41,652
And I think Victor should go check
himself out with his physician

935
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:44,864
to make sure everything is fine, before
things start fallin' off on the man.

936
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:49,744
Perhaps you better tell him that.

937
01:03:51,871 --> 01:03:54,332
You know, I think that would be best.

938
01:03:54,499 --> 01:03:56,083
So do I.

939
01:04:11,224 --> 01:04:12,600
Hi, Victor.

940
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:17,271
I'm back.

941
01:04:24,028 --> 01:04:25,947
Look, cuz, don't even try it, OK?

942
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:29,784
Why don't you get the hell
outta here, cuz.

943
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,994
Get the fuck away from me.

944
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,382
[mouths]

945
01:04:48,553 --> 01:04:49,887
That's very good, Victor.

946
01:04:50,054 --> 01:04:52,974
Could you teach him to roll over
and sit and do all that shit, too?

947
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:56,561
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to you.

948
01:04:56,727 --> 01:04:58,646
Last time we met,
I didn't get a chance to talk to you.

949
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:02,984
- I have nothing to say to you.
- That's cool, I'll do all the talking.

950
01:05:05,027 --> 01:05:07,613
This is a very nice place, Vic.

951
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:10,616
Hi. I like this, this is nice.

952
01:05:11,659 --> 01:05:13,786
Glad you like it.
I must make you a member.

953
01:05:17,206 --> 01:05:21,127
You know, Victor, I know that you're
into a lot of crooked shit.

954
01:05:21,294 --> 01:05:24,547
And I have a pretty good idea
that you had Mikey killed.

955
01:05:25,464 --> 01:05:27,133
And when I find out for sure...

956
01:05:28,342 --> 01:05:30,344
...I'm gonna fuck you up real bad.

957
01:05:30,511 --> 01:05:31,512
Is that so?

958
01:05:32,847 --> 01:05:35,891
Now, listen to me,
my tough little friend.

959
01:05:36,058 --> 01:05:38,894
I don't know from under
what stone you crawled,

960
01:05:39,854 --> 01:05:43,399
or where you get these
ridiculous ideas about me,

961
01:05:44,108 --> 01:05:45,985
but it seems painfully obvious

962
01:05:46,152 --> 01:05:49,989
you haven't the slightest fucking
idea who you're dealing with.

963
01:05:51,198 --> 01:05:54,368
Now, my advice to you is...

964
01:05:54,535 --> 01:05:57,371
...crawl back to your
little stone in Detroit,

965
01:05:57,538 --> 01:06:01,375
before you get squashed, OK?

966
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:03,502
Please step away from the table, sir.

967
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:05,212
Gotta go now, Vic.

968
01:06:05,379 --> 01:06:07,757
- Nice meeting you again.
- Yeah.

969
01:06:08,883 --> 01:06:10,926
[handcuffs clicking]

970
01:06:14,388 --> 01:06:16,515
Catch you later, Vic.

971
01:06:16,682 --> 01:06:18,768
I can't wait.

972
01:06:31,906 --> 01:06:35,117
Don't I know you guys from some place?
You look so familiar.

973
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:41,082
Detective Foley,
this is becoming very irritating.

974
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:43,334
Why are you bothering Victor Maitland?

975
01:06:46,754 --> 01:06:50,424
I had a friend named Michael Tandino
that used to work for Victor Maitland.

976
01:06:50,591 --> 01:06:53,594
And Maitland had him killed.
I can't prove that right now,

977
01:06:53,761 --> 01:06:55,846
but when I do,
you'll be the first to know.

978
01:06:57,932 --> 01:07:00,893
Forget what you can prove.
Talk to me.

979
01:07:03,604 --> 01:07:06,440
OK, listen, everybody knows
that Victor Maitland

980
01:07:06,607 --> 01:07:08,109
is a hot-shot art dealer, OK?

981
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:11,404
But I did some pokin' around and
art's not the only thing that he deals.

982
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:14,407
I went to his warehouse
and I saw some guys unloading a crate

983
01:07:14,573 --> 01:07:16,742
that was filled
with German bearer bonds.

984
01:07:16,909 --> 01:07:20,162
Now, my friend Michael Tandino
had bonds like this on him,

985
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:22,790
coincidentally,
when he was killed in Detroit.

986
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:23,958
Just because Maitland chooses

987
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:26,127
to invest in the same kind of bonds
your friend had,

988
01:07:26,293 --> 01:07:27,878
doesn't necessarily mean he's a killer.

989
01:07:28,045 --> 01:07:30,840
The man's not an investor,
he's a smuggler, OK?

990
01:07:31,006 --> 01:07:33,551
Be it bonds or drugs or whatever.

991
01:07:33,718 --> 01:07:36,303
The crate that I saw
didn't even pass through Customs.

992
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:38,139
Maitland is paying someone so his guys

993
01:07:38,305 --> 01:07:40,975
can get the shipments out of Customs
before they get inspected.

994
01:07:41,142 --> 01:07:42,977
Maitland's guys get their hands on it,

995
01:07:43,144 --> 01:07:45,312
they take the drugs
or the bonds out of the crates

996
01:07:45,479 --> 01:07:48,566
and they send it back before
Customs even knows what's going on.

997
01:07:51,444 --> 01:07:52,903
And you witnessed all this?

998
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:55,364
Everything except for the drugs,

999
01:07:55,531 --> 01:07:57,867
but I found coffee grounds
all over the warehouse.

1000
01:07:58,868 --> 01:07:59,994
Coffee grounds?

1001
01:08:00,161 --> 01:08:02,121
You said something about that before.
What does that mean?

1002
01:08:02,288 --> 01:08:04,582
Drugs are sometimes
packed in coffee grounds.

1003
01:08:04,749 --> 01:08:06,000
The scent throws off the dogs.

1004
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:08,335
Very good, lieutenant.
Now what do we do?

1005
01:08:10,713 --> 01:08:12,506
Look, Detective Foley, I...

1006
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:15,676
I'm sorry.

1007
01:08:15,843 --> 01:08:17,344
I'd really like to help you.

1008
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:20,681
If you'd found the drugs,
that's one thing,

1009
01:08:20,848 --> 01:08:23,184
but if your only evidence
is coffee grounds,

1010
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:24,977
we don't have enough
to get a search warrant.

1011
01:08:25,144 --> 01:08:26,854
Come on, guys,
I know how we can get around...

1012
01:08:27,021 --> 01:08:29,648
We don't get around search warrants
in Beverly Hills.

1013
01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:33,486
- Taggart.
- Yes, sir.

1014
01:08:33,652 --> 01:08:35,279
I want you to start checking this out.

1015
01:08:35,446 --> 01:08:39,033
Start with the LAPD, the FBI,
and the Customs Service.

1016
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,576
Hey, wait a minute, Taggart.

1017
01:08:40,743 --> 01:08:43,078
Look, lieutenant,
Maitland is much smarter than that.

1018
01:08:43,245 --> 01:08:44,872
We go and start
snoopin' around his place,

1019
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:47,124
he's gonna close down and get
his shipments from someplace else.

1020
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:49,543
- It'd be a big waste of time.
- Oh, really?

1021
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:52,379
Is that what your extensive experience
leads you to believe?

1022
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:54,757
- Look, I haven't been on your force...
- Sir!

1023
01:08:57,051 --> 01:08:58,219
Oh, shit.

1024
01:08:59,428 --> 01:09:02,431
- Is this the man?
- Yes, sir.

1025
01:09:03,432 --> 01:09:06,101
Is this the gentleman who crashed
through Victor Maitland's window?

1026
01:09:07,394 --> 01:09:11,106
Who disabled an unmarked unit
with a banana?

1027
01:09:11,273 --> 01:09:12,483
Yes, sir.

1028
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:15,986
Who lured Taggart and Rosemont

1029
01:09:16,153 --> 01:09:19,573
into a gross dereliction of duty

1030
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:22,535
at a striptease establishment?

1031
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:24,245
It's Rosewood, sir.

1032
01:09:25,246 --> 01:09:26,497
Yes, sir.

1033
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:32,044
Is this the gentleman who ruined the
buffet at the Harrow Club this morning?

1034
01:09:33,045 --> 01:09:34,755
[Bogomil] Yes, sir.

1035
01:09:34,922 --> 01:09:39,718
I just bet you are the pride
of your department in Detroit.

1036
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:46,934
Lieutenant, I'd like to see you
in your office.

1037
01:09:47,852 --> 01:09:49,270
Yes, sir.

1038
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:54,942
[mocking] Is this the man who...

1039
01:09:55,693 --> 01:09:58,237
...wrecked the buffet
at the Harrow Club this morning?

1040
01:09:58,404 --> 01:10:00,239
[Taggart] Lower your voice,
for Christ's sake.

1041
01:10:00,406 --> 01:10:02,575
Why, can the guy hear me
through the wall?

1042
01:10:02,741 --> 01:10:04,034
[all] Yes, he can.

1043
01:10:20,593 --> 01:10:25,931
Rosewood, take Detective Foley
back to his hotel room,

1044
01:10:26,098 --> 01:10:29,810
watch him pack,
and escort him to the city limits.

1045
01:10:31,312 --> 01:10:33,522
When you get there,
you can give him his gun back.

1046
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:39,320
The two charges of disturbing the peace
have been dropped against you.

1047
01:10:39,486 --> 01:10:42,323
But the chief says if you return
to the city of Beverly Hills,

1048
01:10:42,489 --> 01:10:44,867
the charges will be reinstated

1049
01:10:45,034 --> 01:10:47,536
and you will be prosecuted
to the limit of the law.

1050
01:10:48,245 --> 01:10:49,663
Sir, may I say something?

1051
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:51,081
- [Taggart] Billy...
- What?

1052
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:53,167
Well, he seems to have enough
to follow up...

1053
01:10:53,334 --> 01:10:55,002
You wanna tell that to the chief?

1054
01:10:56,545 --> 01:10:59,381
- No, sir.
- Then I suggest you get moving.

1055
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:02,676
Come on, Axel.

1056
01:11:22,363 --> 01:11:25,366
Right. Let me check on that
tomorrow and get right back to you.

1057
01:11:25,532 --> 01:11:26,825
Thank you.

1058
01:11:27,326 --> 01:11:29,787
- Hi.
- Victor, hi.

1059
01:11:29,954 --> 01:11:32,081
Sit down.
Hope I'm not interrupting you.

1060
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,541
Of course not, don't be silly.

1061
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:37,795
Jenny, there's a gentleman
in town from Detroit

1062
01:11:37,962 --> 01:11:40,923
who says he's a friend
of Michael Tandino.

1063
01:11:41,882 --> 01:11:45,594
He came by the office yesterday
and asked me all sorts of...

1064
01:11:45,761 --> 01:11:48,263
...rather odd questions.
Excuse me, darling.

1065
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:50,891
I believe his name is Foley.

1066
01:11:51,058 --> 01:11:54,395
Since you were such a good friend of
Michael, I was wondering if you were...

1067
01:11:54,561 --> 01:11:56,647
...perhaps familiar with the fellow?

1068
01:11:56,814 --> 01:11:59,650
Well, we... grew up
in the same neighborhood.

1069
01:11:59,817 --> 01:12:01,610
Really? Have you seen him lately?

1070
01:12:03,404 --> 01:12:05,990
He... he came in yesterday.

1071
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:08,242
What, came by here?

1072
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:10,619
Huh.

1073
01:12:11,787 --> 01:12:12,955
And?

1074
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:18,836
He told me that... Mikey'd been killed.

1075
01:12:19,378 --> 01:12:22,089
Yes. Yes, I know.

1076
01:12:24,258 --> 01:12:27,428
- And then?
- That's it.

1077
01:12:27,594 --> 01:12:31,390
He left and...
I haven't seen him since.

1078
01:12:33,434 --> 01:12:36,562
You wouldn't, by any chance, know
where Foley's staying would you?

1079
01:12:36,729 --> 01:12:40,315
I have some information
which just might be helpful for him.

1080
01:12:43,569 --> 01:12:45,487
No, I have no idea.

1081
01:12:48,115 --> 01:12:49,700
[sighing] Yes.

1082
01:12:50,659 --> 01:12:51,785
Yes.

1083
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,371
Yes.

1084
01:12:55,205 --> 01:12:57,291
Well, I hope I didn't
disturb you too much.

1085
01:12:57,458 --> 01:12:59,543
Oh, no, no problem.

1086
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:02,796
- We'll have dinner soon, yes?
- That would be lovely.

1087
01:13:02,963 --> 01:13:04,131
Take care.

1088
01:13:16,518 --> 01:13:18,062
Hey, Billy,
I read the manifest, all right?

1089
01:13:18,228 --> 01:13:20,606
They're expecting
another shipment in today.

1090
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:23,650
- If Bogomil...
- Never mind Bogomil!

1091
01:13:23,817 --> 01:13:26,487
This is a chance to blow this case wide
open, the two of us, what do you say?

1092
01:13:26,653 --> 01:13:27,988
- Come on.
- Look, Axel...

1093
01:13:28,155 --> 01:13:30,324
I wish I could, but I can't!

1094
01:13:30,491 --> 01:13:34,078
- Why?
- Because Bogomil would kill me.

1095
01:13:37,873 --> 01:13:39,166
Billy...

1096
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:41,919
I'm not going to drive you
to the art gallery, Axel.

1097
01:13:42,878 --> 01:13:44,505
It'll just take a couple of minutes!

1098
01:13:44,671 --> 01:13:46,673
My friend Jenny'll let us
in Maitland's warehouse.

1099
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,967
We can be there when the shipment
comes in and nail 'em!

1100
01:13:49,134 --> 01:13:51,136
How can you be sure
if it'll be drugs, or something?

1101
01:13:51,303 --> 01:13:52,596
I got a hunch, OK?

1102
01:13:52,763 --> 01:13:56,517
It's a technique by which many crimes
outside of Beverly Hills get solved.

1103
01:13:57,601 --> 01:14:00,020
Why didn't you tell Bogomil
about this shipment?

1104
01:14:00,187 --> 01:14:03,273
Bogomil does everything by the book.
You know what I'm startin' to think?

1105
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,567
That everybody
in this goddamn town is a robot.

1106
01:14:05,734 --> 01:14:07,903
This thing is very personal to me.

1107
01:14:10,364 --> 01:14:13,033
All they asked me to do
was drive you out of town.

1108
01:14:14,368 --> 01:14:16,286
Now, I'm gonna screw that up, too.

1109
01:14:17,996 --> 01:14:21,875
- [sighs] Boy.
- Billy. I love you.

1110
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:24,253
I just fell in love with you.

1111
01:14:27,214 --> 01:14:30,884
Jenny, how you doing?
This is my good buddy, Billy Rosewood.

1112
01:14:31,051 --> 01:14:32,344
- This is Jenny Summers.
- Hi.

1113
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:35,222
- Billy's a Beverly Hills cop.
- How do you do?

1114
01:14:35,389 --> 01:14:36,515
That's Serge.

1115
01:14:36,682 --> 01:14:40,394
Yo, Serge, will you
get my friend an espresso?

1116
01:14:40,561 --> 01:14:43,105
You want it with a lemon twist?

1117
01:14:43,272 --> 01:14:46,692
Uh... Yeah, sure, if it's no bother.

1118
01:14:46,859 --> 01:14:49,862
- No, don't be stupid.
- [chuckling]

1119
01:14:50,028 --> 01:14:53,532
Axel, Victor Maitland was here
asking questions about you today.

1120
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:56,076
I'm telling you,
he was acting real weird.

1121
01:14:56,243 --> 01:14:59,246
The reason I came down is 'cause
I want to get back inside the warehouse.

1122
01:14:59,413 --> 01:15:02,499
- How 'bout I go with you?
- Jenny, come on, now.

1123
01:15:02,666 --> 01:15:05,752
You work here with Serge,
in a art gallery. You're not a cop.

1124
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:07,880
Axel, if this has anything
to do with Mikey,

1125
01:15:08,046 --> 01:15:09,923
then I want to go
check it out for myself.

1126
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:12,176
I don't have time to stand here
and argue with you.

1127
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:15,053
Wait a second. Let me get my keys...

1128
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:16,972
...and we'll argue on the way.

1129
01:15:20,684 --> 01:15:23,061
Billy, your job's just to sit
out here and observe things.

1130
01:15:23,228 --> 01:15:26,315
- Don't make a move until I get you.
- I don't see why I can't come in.

1131
01:15:26,481 --> 01:15:28,567
You can't go in
'cause you're a cop in this town.

1132
01:15:28,734 --> 01:15:31,195
You go in without probable cause,
they're gonna call it an illegal search.

1133
01:15:31,361 --> 01:15:33,780
You know that. Or didn't they
teach you that in cop school?

1134
01:15:33,947 --> 01:15:36,867
Sit tight. If I find some evidence
I'll come out and get you.

1135
01:15:37,034 --> 01:15:39,119
- But you can't just...
- But nothing. Just be cool.

1136
01:15:39,286 --> 01:15:42,623
If anything jumps off, I'll come
and I'll get you, all right? OK?

1137
01:15:42,789 --> 01:15:44,374
Thank you.

1138
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:48,462
Any chance you're gonna give me that
key and let me go in there by myself?

1139
01:15:48,629 --> 01:15:50,005
No chance.

1140
01:15:51,715 --> 01:15:54,426
Fuck. Come on.

1141
01:16:40,347 --> 01:16:42,140
Looks like they been here already.

1142
01:16:42,307 --> 01:16:45,185
- What exactly are you looking for?
- This.

1143
01:16:45,352 --> 01:16:48,563
This is a crate from overseas,
hasn't passed through Customs yet.

1144
01:16:58,365 --> 01:16:59,741
[Jenny] What is that?

1145
01:17:10,627 --> 01:17:12,212
Coffee?

1146
01:17:12,379 --> 01:17:13,922
[Axel] Yeah, it's coffee on top.

1147
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:21,680
But this ain't sugar.

1148
01:17:21,847 --> 01:17:24,516
- Go get Rosewood.
- Welcome to the party.

1149
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:51,752
Seems we have guests.

1150
01:18:12,939 --> 01:18:14,900
How nice.

1151
01:18:15,067 --> 01:18:17,110
I do like surprises.

1152
01:18:29,122 --> 01:18:30,290
Jeannette.

1153
01:18:34,461 --> 01:18:39,132
I just can't tell you how disappointed
I am to find you here.

1154
01:18:39,299 --> 01:18:41,718
- Victor, listen I...
- Shut up!

1155
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:45,180
I don't want to hear it.

1156
01:19:03,031 --> 01:19:06,660
Take her to the car
and wait for me, OK?

1157
01:19:06,827 --> 01:19:08,370
What are you gonna do with him?

1158
01:19:08,537 --> 01:19:13,250
I think you should be more worried
about what we're going to do with you.

1159
01:19:13,417 --> 01:19:16,086
Jenny, don't worry about me.
We got cocaine and coffee here.

1160
01:19:16,253 --> 01:19:18,171
We're gonna get wired
and have a big party.

1161
01:19:18,338 --> 01:19:20,757
Thanks for havin' me over Vic,
this is very nice.

1162
01:19:22,008 --> 01:19:23,885
You say something?

1163
01:19:32,018 --> 01:19:33,437
[sighs]

1164
01:19:38,608 --> 01:19:40,193
If somethin' happens to her...

1165
01:19:41,403 --> 01:19:42,779
Mm?

1166
01:19:43,405 --> 01:19:45,365
I'm all ears.

1167
01:19:46,825 --> 01:19:47,951
...I'll kill you.

1168
01:19:49,661 --> 01:19:50,829
Really?

1169
01:19:51,913 --> 01:19:53,373
That would be a neat trick.

1170
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:06,928
Well, cuz.

1171
01:20:07,929 --> 01:20:09,556
Are you still pissed at me?

1172
01:20:11,391 --> 01:20:14,561
Oh, no. No.

1173
01:20:16,104 --> 01:20:18,190
But I should've taken care of you
in Detroit.

1174
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:26,406
When I popped your little buddy.

1175
01:20:27,616 --> 01:20:29,951
[grunting]

1176
01:20:30,118 --> 01:20:32,662
[coughing]

1177
01:20:33,246 --> 01:20:34,789
Goodbye, Mr. Foley.

1178
01:20:37,334 --> 01:20:38,585
Have a nice day.

1179
01:20:39,336 --> 01:20:40,712
[gasping] I'll try.

1180
01:21:04,986 --> 01:21:07,322
[groans] Damn it.

1181
01:21:10,659 --> 01:21:12,118
Oh, boy.

1182
01:21:24,297 --> 01:21:28,385
How's that little bump on the head doin'
I gave you in Detroit, huh?

1183
01:21:28,552 --> 01:21:30,136
Healed up nice, I hope.

1184
01:21:32,806 --> 01:21:34,015
[grunting]

1185
01:21:34,182 --> 01:21:35,475
[coughing]

1186
01:21:40,939 --> 01:21:42,482
[Axel coughing]

1187
01:21:56,329 --> 01:21:57,330
Freeze!

1188
01:22:01,334 --> 01:22:02,335
[screams]

1189
01:22:11,344 --> 01:22:12,429
Thanks, man.

1190
01:22:23,398 --> 01:22:25,525
[tires screeching]

1191
01:22:27,569 --> 01:22:30,864
Tell Taggart to check out the warehouse
and act on whatever he finds.

1192
01:22:31,031 --> 01:22:32,198
I'll explain it to him later.

1193
01:22:32,365 --> 01:22:34,492
DD-6, Sergeant Taggart is here now,

1194
01:22:34,659 --> 01:22:36,369
<i>- and he wants to talk to you.</i>
- Shit!

1195
01:22:36,536 --> 01:22:39,456
Billy, what the hell is goin' on?

1196
01:22:39,623 --> 01:22:41,666
I'm sorry, Sarg, I can't talk now.

1197
01:22:41,833 --> 01:22:43,627
What you mean you can't talk now?

1198
01:22:43,793 --> 01:22:47,464
Just check out the warehouse and
please don't say anything to Bogomil.

1199
01:22:48,548 --> 01:22:50,592
Sorry, sir, he's not
transmitting anymore.

1200
01:22:50,759 --> 01:22:51,926
- Ah, shit!
- What's the matter?

1201
01:22:52,093 --> 01:22:55,305
It's Billy, he's doin' somethin'
dumb again, but I don't know what.

1202
01:22:55,472 --> 01:22:56,931
Was he calling from the hotel?

1203
01:22:57,098 --> 01:22:58,558
No, sir.

1204
01:22:59,392 --> 01:23:02,729
Right now his car is heading north
on Palm Canyon Road.

1205
01:23:02,896 --> 01:23:04,606
Hey, we were there this morning.

1206
01:23:04,773 --> 01:23:06,650
- [Taggart] What?
- Yeah.

1207
01:23:06,816 --> 01:23:09,027
Foley was up there,
looking over Maitland's house.

1208
01:23:09,194 --> 01:23:10,779
Do you have the address
of that warehouse?

1209
01:23:10,945 --> 01:23:12,072
Yes, sir.

1210
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:15,575
Here. You two check that place out.

1211
01:23:15,742 --> 01:23:18,620
Then find me, and let me know
what the hell is goin' on over there.

1212
01:23:18,787 --> 01:23:20,664
And don't talk to anybody but me!

1213
01:23:32,884 --> 01:23:34,886
[car approaching]

1214
01:23:41,768 --> 01:23:43,978
Hold it right there, Foley,
you're under arrest.

1215
01:23:44,145 --> 01:23:45,438
Billy, what the hell are you doin' here?

1216
01:23:45,605 --> 01:23:46,940
I stole my gun and forced him
to bring me here.

1217
01:23:47,107 --> 01:23:50,360
No, he didn't, Sarg. Look, everything
he said about Maitland is right.

1218
01:23:50,527 --> 01:23:53,196
Now, he's kidnapped a woman
and he's got her in his house.

1219
01:23:54,322 --> 01:23:55,949
Well, let's go in there and get her.

1220
01:23:56,116 --> 01:23:57,701
What the fuck you think
I'm tryin' to do here?

1221
01:23:57,867 --> 01:24:01,204
You're not doin' anything! We'll have
a search warrant in 20 minutes.

1222
01:24:01,371 --> 01:24:04,207
- She'll be dead in 20 minutes.
- Stop workin' on that lock.

1223
01:24:04,374 --> 01:24:07,919
I'm gonna open this door and I'm goin'
inside. You wanna stop me? Shoot me.

1224
01:24:10,338 --> 01:24:11,923
- Me, too.
- Billy!

1225
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:14,426
You can do what you want,
but I'm going in with Axel.

1226
01:24:14,592 --> 01:24:16,928
Goddamn it, Billy,
this is really serious trouble!

1227
01:24:17,095 --> 01:24:19,139
If you're lucky, you'll just get fired.

1228
01:24:19,305 --> 01:24:21,099
- [door opens]
- [Axel] Got it.

1229
01:24:21,266 --> 01:24:23,184
[Taggart] It's my last warning, Foley.

1230
01:24:29,274 --> 01:24:33,278
- Billy!
- I'm sorry, Sarg, I've got to.

1231
01:24:37,574 --> 01:24:40,285
Shit. Wait a minute.

1232
01:24:52,672 --> 01:24:55,008
- [beeping]
- [man] What's that?

1233
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:59,179
Looks like east gate. Punch it up.

1234
01:25:03,308 --> 01:25:05,351
Who the hell is that?

1235
01:25:06,186 --> 01:25:07,645
Better get Maitland up here.

1236
01:25:24,496 --> 01:25:27,165
Where is everybody?
Owensby, is Rosewood back yet?

1237
01:25:27,332 --> 01:25:29,167
- No, sir.
- Have you seen Taggart?

1238
01:25:29,334 --> 01:25:31,127
He took off about ten minutes ago.

1239
01:25:41,221 --> 01:25:43,181
Foley's on the grounds.

1240
01:25:43,348 --> 01:25:45,141
Well, how the hell should I know?

1241
01:25:45,308 --> 01:25:47,143
Get some people out there right away.

1242
01:25:50,104 --> 01:25:52,148
Don't take your eyes off that screen.

1243
01:26:23,805 --> 01:26:26,140
I want you to try to locate
Taggart and Rosewood.

1244
01:26:37,235 --> 01:26:38,444
Come on.

1245
01:26:43,950 --> 01:26:45,535
[grunts]

1246
01:26:52,584 --> 01:26:54,252
[Taggart] OK, OK, OK.

1247
01:26:55,795 --> 01:26:58,047
[grunting] Shit.

1248
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:01,968
[yelling]

1249
01:27:02,594 --> 01:27:05,972
- They must be away from the car, sir.
- I can see that, keep trying.

1250
01:27:07,223 --> 01:27:09,976
- DD-13, come in please.
- What's their 20?

1251
01:27:14,647 --> 01:27:17,942
- 609 Palm Canyon Road.
- Who lives at that address?

1252
01:27:21,863 --> 01:27:23,656
A Victor Maitland, sir.

1253
01:27:25,074 --> 01:27:27,160
[gasping] Try again.

1254
01:27:27,327 --> 01:27:28,661
Let's go around.

1255
01:27:29,787 --> 01:27:31,497
We can do it. Come on.

1256
01:27:36,669 --> 01:27:37,670
Ready?

1257
01:27:37,837 --> 01:27:39,797
One, two...

1258
01:27:41,382 --> 01:27:43,635
[grunting]

1259
01:27:47,263 --> 01:27:49,307
[Taggart grunting]

1260
01:27:49,474 --> 01:27:51,184
[chuckling]

1261
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,564
[machine gun fire]

1262
01:28:11,245 --> 01:28:12,622
You all right?

1263
01:28:16,376 --> 01:28:18,211
What the fuck am I doin' here?

1264
01:28:25,009 --> 01:28:26,219
Drop it!

1265
01:28:35,561 --> 01:28:37,647
- Good shot, Billy.
- Let's go.

1266
01:28:39,148 --> 01:28:41,025
[machine gun fire]

1267
01:28:42,235 --> 01:28:43,945
[all grunting]

1268
01:28:48,574 --> 01:28:51,285
- Jesus Christ!
- Yeah, these guys are serious.

1269
01:28:51,452 --> 01:28:53,079
I hate machine guns.

1270
01:29:02,630 --> 01:29:04,007
Cover me.

1271
01:29:17,478 --> 01:29:19,772
You guys go around front,
I'm gonna check the back.

1272
01:29:22,734 --> 01:29:25,111
Sir, we have a report of shots fired
at that same location.

1273
01:29:25,278 --> 01:29:27,280
609 Palm Canyon Road.

1274
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:31,242
Put out a 998: officers need assistance.

1275
01:29:31,409 --> 01:29:33,119
- Undercovers on the scene.
- Sir?

1276
01:29:33,286 --> 01:29:35,788
Just do it!
I want all north end units to roll.

1277
01:29:35,955 --> 01:29:38,332
South end units stay in their area.

1278
01:29:38,499 --> 01:29:40,084
Damn! Let's go.

1279
01:29:40,251 --> 01:29:42,086
Undercover officers at location.

1280
01:29:50,845 --> 01:29:52,972
Police! You're all under arrest!

1281
01:29:59,479 --> 01:30:02,231
You do that again,
I'll shoot you myself.

1282
01:31:10,466 --> 01:31:12,260
[spent shells clattering]

1283
01:31:14,303 --> 01:31:16,222
You know what I keep thinking about?

1284
01:31:17,515 --> 01:31:19,225
You know the end of <i>Butch Cassidy</i>?

1285
01:31:22,728 --> 01:31:25,565
Where Redford and Newman
are almost out of ammunition.

1286
01:31:27,859 --> 01:31:31,404
And the whole Bolivian Army
is out in front of this little hut.

1287
01:31:33,739 --> 01:31:35,241
Billy...

1288
01:31:36,742 --> 01:31:38,703
I'm gonna make you pay for this.

1289
01:32:26,292 --> 01:32:27,293
[gunshot]

1290
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:30,254
[groaning]

1291
01:32:48,856 --> 01:32:51,651
[siren wailing]

1292
01:32:58,824 --> 01:33:00,743
- You gonna hang around here?
- Fuck no!

1293
01:33:12,296 --> 01:33:13,923
[tires screeching]

1294
01:33:28,187 --> 01:33:30,314
- Freeze it!
- Hold it right there.

1295
01:33:33,859 --> 01:33:35,152
[Bogomil] Oh, shit.

1296
01:33:47,873 --> 01:33:49,292
[Jenny] Axel!

1297
01:33:49,458 --> 01:33:51,752
[gasping]

1298
01:33:53,587 --> 01:33:56,424
Be careful, old boy, you might hit me.

1299
01:34:05,057 --> 01:34:06,058
Freeze!

1300
01:34:14,025 --> 01:34:15,484
[body thudding]

1301
01:34:24,076 --> 01:34:26,954
Police! You're all under arrest!

1302
01:34:27,121 --> 01:34:29,540
Lay down your weapons in front of you

1303
01:34:29,707 --> 01:34:33,252
and take two steps back
with your hands up!

1304
01:34:38,341 --> 01:34:39,550
Very good.

1305
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,552
Great.

1306
01:34:41,719 --> 01:34:43,846
[indistinct radio chatter]

1307
01:34:51,062 --> 01:34:53,147
[indistinct murmuring]

1308
01:35:00,738 --> 01:35:02,239
What the hell's going on here?

1309
01:35:03,074 --> 01:35:04,116
Oh, shit.

1310
01:35:04,283 --> 01:35:06,452
- What's this man doing here?
- Bleeding, sir.

1311
01:35:06,619 --> 01:35:09,872
Rosewood, how come
he isn't wearing cuffs?

1312
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:14,418
Well, he isn't actually in custody, sir.

1313
01:35:14,585 --> 01:35:17,296
Well, place him in custody,
or would you like me to do it?

1314
01:35:17,463 --> 01:35:19,715
Wouldn't you like to hear
my report first, sir?

1315
01:35:22,134 --> 01:35:24,845
You have a report
that explains all this?

1316
01:35:25,721 --> 01:35:26,806
Yes, sir.

1317
01:35:28,265 --> 01:35:31,310
Well, I will be very glad to hear it.

1318
01:35:33,479 --> 01:35:38,109
Well, sir, Ms. Jeannette Summers, the
manager of Mr. Maitland's art gallery,

1319
01:35:38,275 --> 01:35:40,778
accidentally discovered large quantities
of a substance

1320
01:35:40,945 --> 01:35:43,989
she suspected was cocaine
in the art gallery's warehouse.

1321
01:35:44,156 --> 01:35:47,159
She immediately communicated her
discovery to Detective Axel Foley

1322
01:35:47,326 --> 01:35:48,661
of the Detroit Police Force.

1323
01:35:50,538 --> 01:35:53,457
Detective Foley was,
at the time, cooperating

1324
01:35:53,624 --> 01:35:57,336
in a joint Beverly Hills-Detroit
investigation of narcotics trafficking.

1325
01:35:57,503 --> 01:36:01,090
Detectives Foley and Rosewood,
responding to Ms. Summers' report,

1326
01:36:01,257 --> 01:36:03,717
proceeded to the warehouse,
where Rosewood did, in fact,

1327
01:36:03,884 --> 01:36:06,429
discover approximately
80 kilos of cocaine.

1328
01:36:07,513 --> 01:36:09,682
Rosewood immediately
called for backup.

1329
01:36:09,849 --> 01:36:11,851
And I dispatched our officers
to this location.

1330
01:36:12,017 --> 01:36:15,312
Sergeant Taggart here,
was the first to arrive at the scene.

1331
01:36:15,479 --> 01:36:18,482
And having probable cause
to believe a felony was in progress,

1332
01:36:18,649 --> 01:36:22,528
Sergeant Taggart joined Rosewood,
with Detective Foley

1333
01:36:22,695 --> 01:36:26,449
present only as an observer,
and proceeded to enter the grounds.

1334
01:36:26,615 --> 01:36:28,284
And in the course
of defending ourselves,

1335
01:36:28,451 --> 01:36:31,537
we shot several suspects,
including Mr. Maitland.

1336
01:36:36,250 --> 01:36:39,003
You expect me to believe that report?

1337
01:36:40,296 --> 01:36:42,131
That's the report I'm filing, sir.

1338
01:36:45,384 --> 01:36:46,886
Sergeant Taggart...

1339
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:49,972
Why don't you tell me what happened?

1340
01:37:03,444 --> 01:37:05,779
Happened just like
the lieutenant said, chief.

1341
01:37:17,875 --> 01:37:23,088
[chuckles] Well, I suppose
congratulations are in order.

1342
01:37:25,466 --> 01:37:27,218
Thank you, sir.

1343
01:37:27,384 --> 01:37:30,262
That report better be
on my desk in the morning.

1344
01:37:30,429 --> 01:37:32,264
Yes, sir, first thing.

1345
01:37:40,773 --> 01:37:43,067
You were lyin' your ass off.

1346
01:37:43,234 --> 01:37:44,443
[both laughing]

1347
01:37:46,779 --> 01:37:49,823
Why don't you go to the hospital
and get your shoulder looked at?

1348
01:37:51,116 --> 01:37:52,493
Excuse me, sir.

1349
01:37:57,957 --> 01:38:00,668
I was wondering if you could,
like, do me a favor, sir?

1350
01:38:01,919 --> 01:38:05,381
- I think your favors are all used up.
- I understand.

1351
01:38:05,548 --> 01:38:08,842
It's just that I was hopin'
you could call my Inspector Todd,

1352
01:38:09,009 --> 01:38:12,304
my boss back home and straighten
things out, but that's all right.

1353
01:38:12,471 --> 01:38:14,390
Guess I'm out of a job.
It's cool, though.

1354
01:38:14,557 --> 01:38:16,892
I think I'm gonna stay in Beverly Hills.
I like it here.

1355
01:38:17,059 --> 01:38:19,520
I'm gonna start my own
private investigation company.

1356
01:38:19,687 --> 01:38:21,063
How's that sound?

1357
01:38:21,230 --> 01:38:23,691
I will talk to Inspector Todd
first thing tomorrow.

1358
01:38:23,857 --> 01:38:25,359
- Will you, really?
- Yes, you bet.

1359
01:38:25,526 --> 01:38:27,778
- Thank you so much, sir.
- You're welcome.

1360
01:38:34,910 --> 01:38:37,955
How you doin'? I'm Axel Foley,
checkin' out of suite 1035.

1361
01:38:38,122 --> 01:38:40,624
One moment, sir.
I'll get your bill.

1362
01:38:42,585 --> 01:38:45,504
- [Taggart clears throat]
- Hey! Guys!

1363
01:38:45,671 --> 01:38:48,966
You all didn't have to see me off.
But I'm very moved by the gesture.

1364
01:38:49,133 --> 01:38:52,720
Bogomil ordered us
to make sure you got out of town.

1365
01:38:54,054 --> 01:38:56,515
You know, that doesn't even matter
to me, Billy. You know what matters?

1366
01:38:56,682 --> 01:38:57,975
That you guys came down here.

1367
01:38:58,142 --> 01:39:01,186
I'm all choked up on the inside.
I got a lump in my throat.

1368
01:39:01,353 --> 01:39:04,148
You look a little misty yourself there,
Taggart.

1369
01:39:04,315 --> 01:39:06,150
- [man] There you go, sir.
- [Axel] Oh, thank you.

1370
01:39:06,317 --> 01:39:10,195
Excuse me. The Beverly Hills Police
Department is picking that up.

1371
01:39:10,362 --> 01:39:12,448
Oh, get outta here! Guys!

1372
01:39:12,615 --> 01:39:16,118
That's the last straw. That was
the last straw, you guys are too nice.

1373
01:39:16,285 --> 01:39:19,079
Sir, do you sell those
Beverly Palm robes down here?

1374
01:39:19,246 --> 01:39:21,040
Yes, we do sir,
they're $95 apiece.

1375
01:39:21,206 --> 01:39:23,125
Money is no object, put 'em on my tab.

1376
01:39:23,292 --> 01:39:24,918
I have to have two of them, though.

1377
01:39:27,046 --> 01:39:30,758
Billy, you saved my life, OK?

1378
01:39:30,924 --> 01:39:32,885
I don't think I'll ever
be able to repay you.

1379
01:39:33,052 --> 01:39:34,595
But as a token of my appreciation,

1380
01:39:34,762 --> 01:39:37,348
I want you to have this
fine Beverly Palm robe.

1381
01:39:37,514 --> 01:39:39,183
Each time you get out of the shower
and you're dripping wet,

1382
01:39:39,350 --> 01:39:41,894
for the rest of your life, I want you
to think about our friendship.

1383
01:39:42,061 --> 01:39:44,938
I want you to think about Axel Foley.
I love you, Billy.

1384
01:39:49,318 --> 01:39:51,862
- Thanks, Axel.
- [laughs]

1385
01:39:52,029 --> 01:39:56,367
Here, let me take this.
You should rest that arm.

1386
01:39:56,533 --> 01:39:58,702
Billy, take care of the tab, would you?

1387
01:39:59,536 --> 01:40:01,664
- Hey, Taggart.
- Here you are, sir.

1388
01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:03,582
This is for you.

1389
01:40:03,749 --> 01:40:06,585
No, that's all right.
You keep it as a souvenir.

1390
01:40:08,504 --> 01:40:10,506
I already have three of 'em in my bag.

1391
01:40:14,927 --> 01:40:16,387
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sir.

1392
01:40:16,553 --> 01:40:18,389
- Take it easy.
- You're not gonna say goodbye?

1393
01:40:19,598 --> 01:40:22,226
Why, ain't you guys gonna tail me
to the city limits, anyway?

1394
01:40:22,393 --> 01:40:25,938
- Yes, we are.
- I figured you would.

1395
01:40:26,105 --> 01:40:28,357
I was thinking about stopping off
and getting something to drink, though.

1396
01:40:28,524 --> 01:40:30,567
Yeah, we sorta figured you would.

1397
01:40:30,734 --> 01:40:32,111
That mean you guys
are gonna join me?

1398
01:40:32,277 --> 01:40:35,656
I don't think so, Axel,
we're still on duty.

1399
01:40:36,907 --> 01:40:40,119
Well, I don't think one beer's
gonna kill us, Billy.

1400
01:40:40,285 --> 01:40:43,372
That's right, listen to Taggart here.
Lighten up, all right?

1401
01:40:43,539 --> 01:40:46,083
One drink's not gonna kill us.

1402
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:47,584
[♪ Patti LaBelle: <i>Stir It Up</i>]

1403
01:40:47,751 --> 01:40:48,877
[Axel] Hey, guys...

1404
01:40:49,044 --> 01:40:51,630
If you fall too far behind,
don't be afraid to honk, OK?

1405
01:40:51,797 --> 01:40:53,465
Where we goin' anyway?

1406
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:56,093
Don't worry about it,
just follow my lead.

1407
01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:58,637
I know the perfect place.
You guys will love it.

1408
01:40:58,804 --> 01:41:00,055
Trust me.
