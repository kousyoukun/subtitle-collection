know what this is? This is a federal tax stamp.You can't get no cleaner than that. Talk to me.

10
00:02:48,844 --> 00:02:51,378
如果是他妈这么棒，为什么你不要了它呢? Why don't you go into
business yourself if this is such a great deal?

11
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:57,742
我想, 但我不是来自底特律的, 我不知道谁能应付这么大的任务.你们该有门路的, I would, but I ain't from Detroit.I
don't know who could handle a job this big. You have the connections.

12
00:02:58,084 --> 00:02:59,370
告诉我些, 我是个生意人, 我要坐下, 随你们怎么做吧 Tell me something. I'm a
businessman.I'm gonna sit down. Do what you want.

13
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:02,868

- You're a sharp kid. I like you.

I appreciate it. Cousin, my man,
don't dash yet. 我很感激。表兄，老兄，别走

18
00:03:15,302 --> 00:03:17,636
这像是只有两千块给我，这看起来不像五千块 This is like two grand to me.
This doesn't look like $5,000.

19
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:21,265
-给我, 让我看看 -这批货值五千块, 那才有两千 - Gimme that. Let me see that.
- The bill's for $5,000. That's two.

20
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,077
你知道吗?气死我了，我告诉我的手下要五千块的， You know what? This
pisses me off.I told my people five grand.

21
00:03:25,146 --> 00:03:27,875
-但看看, 他们骗我们 不是，他们骗你，我要我的钱 - Look at this shit. They stiffed us.
- They stiffed you. I want my money.

22
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:32,651
婊子养的, 现在你没法指望任何人 ，不过我跟你说, 我们现在别他妈的争论了. Son of a bitch, you can't count on anybody today.
But I tell you what... let's not fucking hassle about it now.

23
00:03:33,321 --> 00:03:36,656
你先拿这两千块，下次我再支付给你 Take the two grand, and
on the next score, I'll make it up to you.

24
00:03:36,826 --> 00:03:39,746
别耍我，耍别人去，这是废话 Don't jerk me off. Jerk
somebody else off. This is bullshit.

25
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:43,254
我要五千，不是两千。别这样对待我 I need $5,000, not $2,000.
Don't do this to me.

26
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:46,745
别无理取闹，你没法对付强尼布那那 Don't be unreasonable.
You're not dealing with Johnny Bananas.

27
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,862
我不知道什么强尼布那那，但我可否要我的钱？
I got no idea what Johnny Banana...

28
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:54,842
我慢慢地跟你说，我要五千块，五千块, 看我的嘴巴, 五千块, 那是我需要的。 Can I say it slow for you?
I need $5,000. Read my lips.$5,000 is what I need.

29
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:56,972
这是狗屁，没钱什么都不行 This is bullshit here.
I can't do nothing with that.

30
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:00,112
你要做混蛋就自己抽光它们吧 If you want to be an asshole,
take the whole load and smoke 'em yourself.

31
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:05,379
我不抽好彩，我抽加长剑牌 我给你我的回答，我没法自己定价格。 - I don't smoke Lucky Strike. I smoke king-size Kent.
I got people I gotta answer to. I can't make a price on my own.

32
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:09,023
该死，跟你合作真好 Fuck this. Nice
doin'business with you, kid.

33
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:11,355
嘿，伙计，你们在这儿干什么？
Hey, buddy, what you doing here?

34
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:13,624
长官，你知道几分钟前发生了什么事吗？你不会相信的来看看这个 Officers, you know what happened
a few minutes ago? You won't believe this Check this out..

35
00:04:14,096 --> 00:04:19,631
货车开不动，伙计，它停了。你可有充电电线，帮我一下？ The truck... it just stopped, man.Just stopped.
You got some jumper cables?.You give me a jump?

36
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:24,470
-我认识你吗？ -不，我从水牛城来的 Hey, don't I know you from some place?
No, that ain't me. I'm from Buffalo.

37
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:30,107
你们俩家伙，拿身份证出来
Both you guys, break out some I.D.

38
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:37,208
我们快他妈的离开这里

00:06:08,109 --> 00:06:10,976
Ah, shit. What the... 哦，靠。这...

40
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:34,462
（蔬菜）

41
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,992
回来！

42
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,165
该死 Aw, shit.

43
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:47,331
别动，混蛋！ Freeze, asshole.

44
00:07:55,816 --> 00:07:57,908
福里，我们早该知道
Foley, we should've known it was you.

45
00:08:04,992 --> 00:08:06,992
嘿，阿克塞尔，就该这么做！
Hey, hey, Axel, way to go.

46
00:08:06,993 --> 00:08:08,461
我不明白。 我没有时间给你，杰弗瑞。 - I don't understand.
- I don't have time for you, Jeffrey.

47
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:12,499
陶德要找你，他很生气，他说这是你最糟的一次 Todd's lookin' for you. He's pissed.
You know what he said? This is your worst fuckup ever.

48
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:16,833
我个人不同意，他当时又不在场 我知道了，杰弗。谢谢。 Personally, I don't think that's
true.- He's not in there. - I can see that, Jeff. Thanks.

49
00:08:17,004 --> 00:08:21,567
如果你抓到他们，他可能不会这么生气，但我听说你搞价钱被捉住了… If you'd busted these guys, maybe he
wouldn't have been so mad. I heard you got caught up haggling for money.

50
00:08:21,908 --> 00:08:24,773
两千块是不够的，如果我拿了它，他们会知道我是警察 $2,000 wasn't enough money.
If I tookit, they'd have known I was a cop.

51
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,238
别烦我... 别走开... 你这个混蛋
Don't go anywhere. You are asshole

52
00:08:29,283 --> 00:08:34,247
我不是说你做错了, 但若你抓到他们就会好一点 I'm not saying you did anything
wrong.lf you had busted them, it would've worked out better.

53
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:37,628
-你去哪里？ -拿我的屎离开这里 - Where you going now?
- Get my shit and get outta here.

54
00:08:37,757 --> 00:08:40,197
大错特错，要我的意见吗？ -不要 No, big mistake,
big mistake.Want my advice?

55
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,296
知道如果我是你我会怎么做吗? 我不知道.
- Know what I would do if I was you? - I don't.

56
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:45,390
进去跟他谈谈，等着他, 他很快回来 杰弗瑞，走开，不然我开枪射你 Go in there, talk to him, wait for
him.He'll be right back. Get away from me. I'm gonna shoot you.

57
00:08:45,832 --> 00:08:47,494
我不是要教你怎么做，不过你知道我会怎么做吗? I'm not telling you what to do.
But you know what I would do?

58
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,088
不要生气，我不想听你说，行吗？ Just lighten up.
I'm not listening to you, okay?

59
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:52,701
你会令自己更糟糕
You're making it a lot worse for yourself.

60
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:57,159
-看这个，谢谢你们 -阿克塞尔，你有香烟吗？ - Look at this. This is great. Thanks.
- Hey, Axel, you got a cigarette?

61
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:02,882
-那是你写的吗？ 那就是我要告诉你的.那不是秘密-大家都知道那宗货车事件 - Did you write that one?
- That's what I'm telling you.lt's not a secret. Everybody knows about you and the truck.

62
00:09:03,349 --> 00:09:05,809
-杰弗瑞, 你听我说好吗？ -我不想听, 我忽视你 Jeffrey, will you listen to me?
I am not listening to you. I'm ignoring you.

63
00:09:06,287 --> 00:09:09,586
听著…好极，真成熟
Great. Great.Real mature.

64
00:09:10,123 --> 00:09:12,804
我不要听杰弗瑞说，但他还在说 I am not listening
to Jeffrey, but he's still talking.

65
00:09:12,825 --> 00:09:15,354
-我不要听 -我讨厌你这样做 - I am not listening to you.
- I really hate when you do that.

66
00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:16,529
-那么住口吧, 好吗. -那是孩子气.
- Then stop, all right. - It's childish.

67
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:18,984
该死的福里是否在这里？ 哦, 靠
- Is that fuckin' Foley in here? - Oh, shit.

68
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,861
陶德来了，该有好戏了
There's Todd. It's show time.

69
00:09:22,636 --> 00:09:23,830
老板, 我知道你要说什么…
Boss, I know what you're gonna say...

70
00:09:24,004 --> 00:09:27,998
你干嘛没有我批准就去做内应？ Where do you come off
going undercover without authorization?

71
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:31,068
这他妈的都是怎么回事儿?你要做牛仔警察 What the fuck is this
all about?.You wanna play cowboy cop?

72
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:33,170
去别的警区做好了 Go do it in
somebody else's precinct. 72

73
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:37,487
-想听我这方面的故事吗？ -什么他妈的你这方面的故事？ - You wanna hear my side of the story?
- What's your fuckin' side of the story?

74
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:40,680
让我们听听你这方面的故事。 我没兴趣再他妈的对你多说。 - Let's hear your side of the story.
- I'm not taking any more of your shit.

75
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:44,889
知道你这种惊人的举动令本市损失多少钱？ You know how much this
stunt of yours is gonna cost the city? 77

76
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:49,863
我认为不是钱的问题。长官，我认为问题是我公然违反纪律。 I don't think cost is the issue here, sir.I
think the issue should be my blatant disregard for proper procedure.

77
00:09:50,331 --> 00:09:52,331
该死，你说得对，聪明货
You damn right, wiseass.

78
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:56,833
市长打电话给局长，他就打电话给副局长，副局长就来骂我的屁股 The mayor called the chief.The chief
called the deputy chief. The deputy chief just chewed my ass out.

79
00:09:57,338 --> 00:09:59,938
你看我还剩下点儿什么，啊？ You see I don't have
any bit of it left, don't you?

80
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,707
你他妈的从哪儿弄来一卡车香烟？ Where in the fuck did you
get a truckload of cigarettes from anyway?

81
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,342
从迪尔伯恩抢劫案拿到的
From the Dearborn hijack.

82
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:07,039
From the Dearborn hijack?.That fucking bust
went down last week. 从迪尔伯恩抢劫案？-那辆车上周他妈的被充公，

- I tried to tell you.

84
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:13,350
-这不关你他妈的的事 -这个不是我的储物柜 - This is none of your fucking business.
- This is not my locker.

85
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,956
听著，阿克塞尔，不准再设圈套，明白吗 Listen, Axel, no
more of these setups, you understand?

86
00:10:17,957 --> 00:10:22,558
你是个很有潜质的好警察，但你什么该死的事都不懂， You're a good cop.You got great potential...
but you don't know every fucking thing.

87
00:10:22,963 --> 00:10:28,392
我厌倦替你顶罪，再有一次，你就滚到街上去，明白吗？ I'm tired of taking the heat for your ass.One
more time, and you're out on the street. Do you understand me?

88
00:10:28,468 --> 00:10:31,699
-老板…我告诉你... 你听懂了吗！ - Look, Boss, let me tell you...
- Do you understand me?

89
00:10:33,407 --> 00:10:36,069
是，我知道了，老板...
Yeah, I understand. Boss.

90
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:40,479
局长没有把它咬光，你还有一点屁股剩下 The chief ain't chew it
all out.You still got a little ass there.

91
00:10:40,914 --> 00:10:45,647
别他妈的闹了，阿克塞尔，快回家去 Don't fuck with me, Axel.
Not now. Go on, go home.

92
00:12:05,964 --> 00:12:07,522

你还要闯入人家的屋里 I see you're still
breaking in people's houses.

95
00:12:18,276 --> 00:12:21,177
你那个锁有什么用？为什么你不买个他妈的真正的锁呢？ What do you expect with that lock?
Why didn't you buy a real lock?

96
00:12:21,446 --> 00:12:24,406
我不需要锁，我有枪，我会射人 I don't need lock. I got my pistol.
I pop a cap at somebody.

97
00:12:24,783 --> 00:12:29,186
我负担不起电费。关上冰箱，蟑螂会跑进去 I can't afford no electrical bill, though.
Close my refrigerator. You got roaches and shit all inside there.

98
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:31,778
-坐下，伙计，看看你。 怎么了？

我有样东西给你看，我没见你两年了，
I got to show you something.I ain't seen you in two years.

103
00:12:45,104 --> 00:12:49,665

谁他妈的雇用你做保安员？ Who the fuck's gonna
hire you as a security guard?

116
00:13:29,514 --> 00:13:31,709
珍妮桑玛斯 -珍妮桑玛斯？ Jenny Summers.

117
00:13:33,084 --> 00:13:35,710
我好几年没见过珍妮了，她怎么样？ I haven't seen
Jenny in years.What's she up to?

118
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:37,520
她很好 She's doin' great.

119
00:13:37,521 --> 00:13:42,255
她是比佛利山霍利斯本顿画廊的经理 She's the manager of the
Hollis Benton Art Gallery in Beverly Hills.

120
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:45,261
它像是个举世闻名的地方，你以前听说过没有？ It's like a
world-famous place.You ever hear of it?

121
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:48,426
听过，我所有的艺术品都在那里买的
Yeah, I buy all my art there.

122
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,700
八号球，台角袋，中两个
Eight ball, corner pocket, two cushions.

123
00:13:51,035 --> 00:13:53,868
-五十块赌你做不到 -胡说
- Fifty bucks you don't make that shot. - Bullshit.

124
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:55,562
-一百块 -好的 - A hundred.
- You got a bet.

125
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:07,884
-你会怎么做？ -你一直都这么聪明 - What are you gonna do, huh?
- You're just as bright as always.

126
00:14:07,885 --> 00:14:11,549
20、40、60、80…拿去开派对吧 Twenty, forty,
sixty, eighty... Take it. Have a party.

127
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,723
很高兴跟你交易
Pleasure doing business with you.

128
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:17,293
你打算他妈的怎么做？
What the fuck you gonna do?

129
00:14:17,294 --> 00:14:19,559
小姐，再来两杯威士忌加苏打
Miss, excuse me, two more Scotch and sodas?

130
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:30,297
我有个好主意，我们去偷车吧 I got a great idea. I
got a great idea. Let's steal a car.

131
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:39,378
你开玩笑吗？我是个他妈的警察，我不能再偷车了。你怎么回事儿？ Are you serious?.I'm a fuckin'
police officer.I can't steal cars no more. What's wrong with you?

132
00:14:39,884 --> 00:14:43,648
记得那次我们偷的那辆车吗？伙计，一辆他妈的卡迪拉克 Remember the time
we stole that car, man? A fuckin' Cadillac.

133
00:14:46,858 --> 00:14:53,227
我们像两个该死的疯子在高速公路上飞跑 We had to go and drive it
on the expressway... like two fucking maniacs.

134
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,520
我还记得你因此而坐牢 I also remember you had to
go to jail for hidin' that shit too.

135
00:14:58,736 --> 00:15:03,040
那不是监狱，那是公立学校，当你15岁时，公立学校就是监狱。 That wasn't jail. It was a state school.
A state school is jail when you're 15 years old.

136
00:15:03,107 --> 00:15:07,771
不算是坐牢，伙计，比起监狱那像是日间夏令营 Not jail, man.
That's like day camp compared to jail.

137
00:15:08,046 --> 00:15:11,973
为何你被拘捕时没有告发我？我们可是一起的 How come you didn't tell on
me when you got caught, that we were together.

138
00:15:11,974 --> 00:15:14,341
你不知道？ You don't know?

139
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:19,488
-你不知道？
-不知道
- Really?
- No.

140
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,989
因为我爱你 Because I love you, man.

141
00:15:30,768 --> 00:15:32,326
再来一杯 One more round.

142
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:37,504
别动，迈克 我要开门，好吗？ Hold still, Mike.
I gotta open the door, okay?

143
00:15:37,642 --> 00:15:42,609
站住了，好吗，开始了。
Balance yourself. Okay, here we go.

144
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:47,273
我现在开门，好吗？开始了，好，开始了。 I'm opening the door now, okay?
Here we go. All right, here we go.

145
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:48,876
阿克塞尔！ Axel

146
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:52,451
别动！

147
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:56,683
迈克，你去了哪里？
Hey, Mikey.Where've you been?

148
00:15:56,694 --> 00:15:58,423
什么事，扎克？ What's up, Zack?

149
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:04,134
- 你拿著什么？迈克-这是什么？你要洗的衣服？
- What have you got there, Mike?.- Here. What is this, your laundry?

150
00:16:05,503 --> 00:16:08,304
我向基督发誓，扎克，我打算把它们拿回去 I swear to Christ,
Zack, I was gonna bring 'em back.

151
00:16:08,305 --> 00:16:09,534
你迷路了？ - You get lost?

152
00:16:10,008 --> 00:16:13,466
不是，我来看我的朋友，我有这些…
No. I came here to see my friend. I had 'em with me.

153
00:16:13,845 --> 00:16:15,312
我想… I figured, you know...

154
00:16:16,314 --> 00:16:20,446
- 你干什么？-我还能怎么办，迈克？ What're you doin'?.What
am I supposed to do here, Mikey?

155
00:16:20,518 --> 00:16:25,319
那里有满满一大箱这东西，我拿了两叠 我不以为有人会想起它们。 There was a whole box full of those things.
I took a couple of'em. I didn't think anybody was gonna miss 'em.

156
00:16:25,356 --> 00:16:27,057
我以为拿它们…
I figured I'd take 'em...

157
00:16:27,091 --> 00:16:33,293
- 闭嘴-对不起，对不起 -现在闭嘴
- Shut up.- I'm sorry.I'm sorry.- Now shut up.

158
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:36,012
- 求求你 -闭嘴，迈克
- Man, please.- Shut up, Mikey.

159
00:16:40,672 --> 00:16:43,573
我发誓… I swear...

160
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:47,646
我发誓，如果你再出现在那里… I swear, if you ever
show your face out there again...

161
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:52,174
-不会的，我发誓 -我是说，无论何时 -不会的，-无论何时，
- I won't man, I swear.- I won't. - I mean, ever... Ever.

162
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:56,051
我向你保证，伙计，对不起，我神经错乱了，我很抱歉。 I promise you, man.
I'm sorry.I fucked up. I'm sorry.

163
00:16:56,187 --> 00:17:00,953
- 好的，无论何时 -对不起
- Okay. Ever. All right.- I'm sorry.

164
00:17:27,485 --> 00:17:30,085
阿克塞尔！我认为我告诉过你了去医院 Axel，I thought I
told you to go to the hospital.

165
00:17:30,088 --> 00:17:37,885
检查一下你头部的肿块。 -这不是要求，阿克塞尔。 -我的头没事 -Get that bump on your head checked.
It's not a request, Axel. -My head is all right.

166
00:17:46,704 --> 00:17:52,108
老板…可否跟你谈一会？ - Make any statements to anyone?
- Boss?.Can I talk to you for a minute?

167
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:57,309
我听说你会派兰德办这宗案子，就咱俩来说，那家伙不了解情况。 I heard a rumor you're gonna use Rand on this case.
Between the two of us, the guy doesn't know the time of day.

168
00:17:57,515 --> 00:18:02,085
你现在别烦我了 -这是他12年来第一次离开他的桌子 Don't mess with me now.
This is the first time he's left his desk in 12 years.

169
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:05,047
至少他做了12年
At least he's had 12 years.

170
00:18:05,356 --> 00:18:10,595
不管怎样，这是谋杀案，属兰德负责。现在去医院吧。 Anyway, it's a homicide case,
and it belongs to Rand. Now go to the hospital.

171
00:18:10,795 --> 00:18:14,195
-我打听一下你介意吗？ -不要做这该死的事。 - Do you mind if I ask around a little?
- Don't do a damn thing.

172
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:18,669
那是兰德的案子，你个蠢货现在的处境很危险 -我们在这儿谈的是我的一个朋友！ It's Rand's case. Your ass is
skating on thin ice as it is. -We're talking abouta friend of mine here!

173
00:18:19,737 --> 00:18:22,039
是的，没错 Yes, we are, aren't we?

174
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,306
我们分析一下这件事。第一，一个无赖朋友 Let's take a close look at that.
One, a hoodlum friend.

175
00:18:26,978 --> 00:18:28,343
第二，职业杀手行凶
Two, a professional hit.

176
00:18:28,513 --> 00:18:33,382
第三，在一个警察的寓所，这整件事臭名远扬。 Three, in a cop's
apartment.This whole thing stinks to high heaven.

177
00:18:33,351 --> 00:18:35,284
你怎么知道是职业杀手做的？
How do you know it was a professional hit?

178
00:18:35,285 --> 00:18:38,153
我可不是刚从棉花地来到城市 I didn't just walk
into town from the cotton fields.

179
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:41,591
杀你朋友的人并不担心你个小窄屁股， Whoever killed your friend
wasn't worried about your little narrow ass.

180
00:18:41,592 --> 00:18:45,792
否则你早就躺在他身边进灵车了。 If they were, you'd be
lyin' beside him in that meat wagon.

181
00:18:46,496 --> 00:18:48,833
不要做这该死的事，别插手。 Just don't do a damn thing.
Stay outta this.

182
00:18:49,332 --> 00:18:52,812
我还有一些假期，我想现在用我的假期。
I got some vacation time comin' to me. I wanna take my vacation now.

183
00:18:53,335 --> 00:18:59,399
离这宗案子远点儿。 -我只是感到我需要一个小假期，就是这样。 Stay away from this case.
I just feel I need a little vacation. That's all.

184
00:19:03,045 --> 00:19:08,048
好吧，你去完医院就放假了，-谢谢。 All right, as soon as you're finished
at the hospital, you're on vacation. Thank you.

185
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:10,746
但若你想插手这宗案件…
But if you decide to butt into this case...

186
00:19:11,053 --> 00:19:15,080
那你以后都放长假了 it'll be the longest
vacation you ever heard of.

187
00:19:35,444 --> 00:19:38,038
（比佛利山）

188
00:19:45,187 --> 00:19:47,951
（比佛利山饭店）

189
00:19:52,394 --> 00:19:54,259
（罗迪欧大道 卡地亚）

190

191
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:59,225
（凡迪 罗马）

192
00:20:14,449 --> 00:20:16,280
（比佛利山劳斯莱斯公司）

193
00:20:44,913 --> 00:20:46,313
今天入住吗，先生？
Checkin' in today, sir?

194
00:20:46,915 --> 00:20:53,980
那要看情况, 这间饭店贵不贵？ 在比佛利山不算贵, 我给你拿行李好吗？ - Depends. This hotel real expensive?
Not for Beverly Hills.Can I get your bags for you?

195
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:58,885
好的，前座那个袋子
Yeah, that's my bag in the front seat.

196
00:21:08,437 --> 00:21:11,804
抱歉，先生, 我们今晚的房间订满了 I'm sorry, sir.
We have nothing available tonight.

197
00:21:11,973 --> 00:21:16,410
我建议你下次预前一周打电话来订房间 May I suggest that next time
you call for a reservation a week in advance.

198
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:18,937
谢谢 Thank you.

199
00:21:19,014 --> 00:21:20,982
-你好 -有些人很难应付 - Hi.
- Nerve of some people, huh?

200
00:21:21,116 --> 00:21:24,977
-有何效劳？ -阿克塞尔福里订了房间 - May I help you?
- Yes, a reservation for Axel Foley.

201
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:27,679
让我看看 Well, let's see.

202
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,692
对不起，没有这个登记 I'm sorry, I don't
see anything under that name.

203
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:37,564
看看滚石杂志的阿克塞尔福里，该是这个了 Oh, check Rolling Stone
magazine's Axel Foley. That's what it is.

204
00:21:37,632 --> 00:21:43,204
好的…没有滚石杂志，没有阿克塞尔福里，对不起 No. No Rolling
Stone.No Axel Foley. I'm sorry, sir.

205
00:21:43,672 --> 00:21:46,793
你们可能把预订的房间弄错了 That's all right. You
probably made some mistake in reservations.

206
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:48,341
干脆给我另一间房吧
Why don't you just give me another room?

207
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:50,862
对不起，先生，现在没有房间了 I'm sorry, sir, but
there are no rooms available.

208
00:21:53,415 --> 00:21:57,276
你不认为我知道这儿发生了什么吗，小姐？你以为我是谁？ Don't you think I realize
what's going on here, miss?.Who do you think I am?

209
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:00,739
你不认为我知道如果我是个城外来的名人… Don't you think I know
if I was some hotshot from out of town...

210
00:22:00,756 --> 00:22:05,220
你们弄错了预订，我也会马上得到房间，我现在就在楼上放松了 and you made a reservation mistake... I'd
be the first one to get a room, and I'd be upstairs relaxing right now.

211
00:22:05,694 --> 00:22:09,162
我不是名人，只是滚石的小记者 I'm not a hotshot from out of town.
I'm a small reporter from Rolling Stone...

212
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:14,499
来这里做麦克杰克逊的独家采访，报导会刊登在全国各大杂志 in town to do an exclusive interview with Michael Jackson...
that's gonna be picked up by every major magazine in the country.

213
00:22:15,003 --> 00:22:18,004
我想把那篇报导叫做，麦克杰克逊在世界之颠 I was gonna call the article
"Michael Jackson Is Sitting On Top OfThe World."

214
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:21,337
现在我会叫它做，麦克杰克逊可以登上世界之颠 But now I think I might as well just
call it..."Michael Jackson Can Sit On Top Of The World...

215
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,078
但却不能入住比佛利棕榈饭店，因为那里不准黑人入住 Just As Long As He Doesn't Sit In The
Beverly Palm Hotel... Because There's No Niggers Allowed In There."

216
00:22:25,547 --> 00:22:29,540
对不起，先生，我们有一间房临时取消 Excuse me, sir, it seems
we do have a last-minute cancellation.

217
00:22:29,551 --> 00:22:31,416
有一个房间
There is a room available.

218
00:22:31,553 --> 00:22:34,922
是间套房，但只收你单人房的价钱 It's a suite... but I'll
only charge you the single-room rate.

219
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:40,794
谢谢你，抱歉我发脾气，可能是时差问题，我很累了，价钱多少？ Thank you. I'm sorry I got upset.lt's probably jet lag.
I'm very tired. - I understand. - What's the rate anyway?

220
00:22:41,096 --> 00:22:43,087
235块一晚，先生
That'll be $235 a night, sir.

221
00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:50,337
好… - Fine, fine.

222
00:22:50,438 --> 00:22:52,998
- 1035号房间 -谢谢你
- That'll be suite 1035.- Thank you very much.

223
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:55,736
- 是的，先生。 -谢谢你
- Yes, sir. - Thank you. - Here you go.

224
00:22:55,811 --> 00:22:58,131
要是麦可找我 告诉他我的房间号码 If Michael
calls, tell him what room I'm in.

225
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,613
当然，先生。 Of course, sir.

226
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,536
-你今天好吗？ -你好
- How you are doing today? - Hi.

227
00:24:04,846 --> 00:24:07,679
我很好，我叫瑟奇，有何效劳？ I am fine. My name
is Serge.How can I help you?

228
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,881
我想找珍妮桑玛斯小姐
Yeah, I'm looking for Miss Jenny Summers.

229
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,847
这里很忙，贵姓？ She's very busy today.
Maybe you can give me your name.

230
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:18,924
- 我叫阿克塞尔福里 -有何贵干？ - My name is Axel Foley.
- And what it's "portaining"?

231
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:23,986
我不明白你说什么。 -贵干…即是关于… I didn't understand what you said.
Portaining... What it's meaning, regarding?

232
00:24:24,397 --> 00:24:26,957
关于什么事？我是她的老朋友 Oh, what's it regarding?
I'm an old acquaintance of hers.

This is some kind of joke, right?

你可想起诉这探员袭击你？ 在我们那儿，警察不会起诉警察。 Do you wish to file chargesagainst this officer for assault?

354
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:54,927
在比佛利山我们是严格依规矩办事 Well, in Beverly
Hills, we go strictly by the book.

355
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,828
你为何到来时不通知我们？ Now why didn't you
inform us when you came to town?

356
00:33:57,836 --> 00:34:03,273
我在放假 -为何你在麦特兰的办公室？ I'm on vacation. If you're on vacation,
what business did you have with Victor Maitland?

357
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:07,314
我要上厕所，我经过那儿，那里看来很干净，我就停下来了。 I had to go to the bathroom.
I was walkin' by. It looked clean. I stopped.

358
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:14,284
你常带著配枪放假吗？ -不知道，我从没放过假 You always take your gun on vacation?
I don't know. I never been on vacation before.

359
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,852
不过在底特律，警察必须要一直携带枪械 But, in Detroit, cops are
required to carry a firearm at all times.

360
00:34:17,956 --> 00:34:20,254
如果你要带枪，我建议你回去那里吧 If you wanna carry a
gun, I suggest you go back there.

361
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,756
我恨不得快点回去，如果你想知道真相。 I really can't wait to get
back there, if you wanna know the truth.

362
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:26,590
是吗？我刚跟底特律的陶德探员谈过 Is that so? I just got off
the phone with an Inspector Todd in Detroit.

363
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:30,157
你可记得这名字？
Does that name ring a bell?

364
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:35,631
他是我上司 -他说他们不大欢迎你回去， He's my boss. -He tells
me you may not be very welcome back there.

365
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:40,343
他说你是个出色的年轻干探 He says that you're
an outstanding young detective.

366
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,246
这使我难以相信
I find that very difficult to believe.

367
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:44,846
不过这是真的 It's true.

368
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:49,743
他还说他差点因为你违抗命令而把你开除，我相信是真的 He also says they nearly had to fire
you for insubordination. I find that very easy to believe.

369
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:52,884
你来这里干什么？
Now, what are you doing in Beverly Hills?

370
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:57,924
我在放假，我去上厕所，接下来你知道，有六个傢伙把我抛出窗外 I told you, I'm on vacation. I went to the bathroom.
The next thing I know, six guys throw me out a window.

371
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:03,498
可想听听陶德探员的口信？ -不用了 Inspector Todd gave me a message for you.
Wanna hear it? I don't think so.

372
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:08,740
他说若你在这里调查坦丁诺被杀一案，就别回来 He says if you're out here investigating
the Tandino murder... you needn't bother coming back.

373
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:14,769
他说若我们通知他你在调查这宗案子，他就停你的花费并开除你 He tells me that if we inform him you are
working on this case... he'll have you brought up on charges and fired.

374
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:18,339
最后一次，你在干什么？
Now, one last time, what are you doing?

375
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:21,978
- 我在放假 -放假
- I'm on vacation. - Vacation. Vacation.

376
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:28,221
罗斯伍德，带福里先生去法庭，让他准备保释 Rosewood, take Mr. Foley over
to the courthouse... and let him arrange for bail.

377
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,685
先生，跟我来吧
Would you follow me, sir?

378
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:35,700
我得告诉你们，你们真是非常有礼貌 I gotta hand it to you guys,
if anything, you are extremely polite.

379
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:38,399
塔格特的拳锋很凌厉
Pretty good punch you got there, Taggart.

380
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,204
请 Afteryou.

381
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,207
请 After you.

382
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:51,073
你们真是友善
You guys are so sweet, you know that?

383
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,515
谢谢你保释我出来
Thanks for bailin' me out, Jen.

384
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,246
如果我知道你被拘捕的原因，我就不会来了 Well, if I'd known why
you'd been arrested, I wouldn't have come.

385
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,123
你不是认真的吧
Oh, you don't mean that.

386
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,456
我不是认真的 No, I don't mean that.

387
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,940
如果不是维多麦特兰，我现在只会做侍者 Axel, if it wasn't for
Victor Maitland, I'd be waiting on tables.

388
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:10,901
迈克被杀那天，他来我公寓，拿著一袋德国无记名债券 It just so happens that the day Mikey got
killed, he came to my apartment... with a bag of German bearer bonds.

389
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,535
我相信是从凶手那里偷来的 Now I think he stole
'em from whoever had him killed.

390
00:36:13,536 --> 00:36:16,306
当我提起迈克的名字，麦特兰就发疯并把我抛出去了 When I mentioned Mikey
to Maitland, he went nuts and threw me out.

391
00:36:16,404 --> 00:36:18,540
阿克塞尔，你的样子真像无赖
Axel, you look like a hoodlum.

392
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:22,341
你没有预约，就拿著手枪闯入他的办公室 You go barging into his office
without an appointment. You're carrying a gun.

393
00:36:22,546 --> 00:36:25,743
如果你闯入我的办公室并且我不认识你，我也会把你抛出去 If you barged into my
office, and I didn't know you, I'd throw you out.

394
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:27,482
这辆车是你的？ Is this your car?

395
00:36:27,551 --> 00:36:30,752
不是，在比佛利山，我们都爱顺手牵羊 Oh, no, in Beverly Hills,
we just take whichever car's closest.

396
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:35,923
我记得你以前是开那辆破旧的蓝色雪佛兰新星 I remember you used
to drive that crappy, blue Chevy Nova.

397
00:36:36,593 --> 00:36:38,493
你现在开什么车？
What are you driving now?

398
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:41,960
还是那辆破旧的蓝色雪佛兰新星
The same crappy, blue Chevy Nova.

399
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:45,296
-我研究艺术是太迟了吧？ -是的
- Think it's late for me to study art? - Yeah, I do.

400
00:36:45,702 --> 00:36:48,703
阿克塞尔，你为什么要找维多？
Axel, why were you bothering Victor?

401
00:36:48,704 --> 00:36:52,300
你不是认为他跟迈克的死有关吧？ You don't think he has anything
to do with Mikey getting killed, do you?

402
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,941
不是，我只是闲逛一下，我看他没做过什么 Oh, no, no. I was just poking around.
I don't think he did nothin'.

403
00:36:55,412 --> 00:37:02,177
阿克塞尔，维多是美国顶尖艺术品商人，他做了十年了 Axel, Victor Maitland is one of the top
art dealers in the United States. He has been for ten years.

404
00:37:02,552 --> 00:37:04,315
令我印象深刻 I'm impressed.

405
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:12,490
-你在往后面看什么？ -那些警察，他们在跟踪我们 What are you looking back there for?
The cops... they're following us.

406
00:37:12,896 --> 00:37:14,727
什么？ What?..

407
00:37:14,898 --> 00:37:16,092
Where? 哪里？

408
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:20,360
在后面，右边，米黄色福特
In the back on the right. The beige Ford.

409
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,360
看看这个房间，很不可思议吧
Do you believe this place?

410
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:53,128
阿克塞尔，你怎能负担得起？
Axel, how can you afford this?

411
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,062
他们只收我单人房的价钱 They're only
charging me a single-room rate.

412
00:37:55,472 --> 00:37:56,872
你怎能负担得起？
How can you afford that?

413
00:37:56,973 --> 00:38:00,274
我负担不来，但你可知道他们在浴室里有什么？ - Actually, I can't afford it.
But you know what they got inside that bathroom?

414
00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:03,037
绣上这饭店缩写的小浴袍 Little robes with
little initials of the hotel on it.

415
00:38:03,139 --> 00:38:05,846
我喜欢这里，我不想离开
I love this place. I can't leave this shit.

416
00:38:05,982 --> 00:38:07,982
-我要偷一件，你要一个吗？ -不要
- I'm gonna steal a robe. You want one? - No, thanks.

417
00:38:07,983 --> 00:38:11,385
要拖鞋吗？我也会偷 You want slippers? I'm gonna
steal some of them too. Take some of this.

418
00:38:11,988 --> 00:38:13,717
对不起，等一会 Excuse me two seconds.

419
00:38:16,993 --> 00:38:21,794
客房服务，我是1035号房间的福里先生 Hello, room service.
Yes, this is Mr. Axel Foley in suite 1035.

420
00:38:21,998 --> 00:38:24,865
我想点宵夜餐点 Yeah, I'd like to order
something from your late supper menu.

421
00:38:24,968 --> 00:38:28,665
你们把它送去停在威尔希尔道的米黄色福特 But listen, I want to deliver
it to this beige Ford that's on Wilshire.

422

送一客大虾沙拉三明治去，对 Send down one bay
shrimp salad sandwich. Okay? Right.

423
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:37,472
蒔萝汁蒸鮭鱼凉拌好吃吗 And is the cold poached
salmon in dill sauce tasty?

424
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:42,075
好，送一客去，还要一些甜品 Okay. Send one of those down.
And send something for dessert. Thanks.

425
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,716
很好，谢谢 All right, thank you.

426
00:38:47,255 --> 00:38:49,855
你真是个淘气鬼，你会住多久？ You're quite a sport.
How long are you gonna stay?

427
00:38:49,993 --> 00:38:52,674
直到我知道谁杀了迈克为止 I'm gonna be in town
until I find out who killed Mikey.

428
00:38:54,297 --> 00:38:59,733
我很认真的考虑要去他工作的仓库调查一下 And I'm very seriously considering going down
to that warehouse... where he worked and checkin' that place out.

429
00:39:00,103 --> 00:39:03,231
真的？你打算怎样进去？ Oh, really? And how
are you planning on getting in?

430
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,596
-先生，晚上好 -这他妈的是什么？ -宵夜，福里先生的问候 Good evening, sir.
- What the hell is that? - Late supper, compliments of Mr. Foley.

431
00:39:28,698 --> 00:39:33,735
-福里？他怎知道我们在这？ -因为我让你开车 Foley? How'd he
know we were here? 'Cause I let you drive.

432
00:39:33,736 --> 00:39:36,056
我要两条香蕉，多少钱？ I need a couple of bananas.
How much are they?

433
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:41,406
自助餐是12.5块，有桃子、李子、橙和香蕉 The buffet plate is $12.50.
You get peaches, plums, oranges and bananas.

434
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:44,512

435
00:39:48,351 --> 00:39:52,154
嘘，走吧，拿着香蕉。

- Certainly, sir. - This really looks great.

438
00:40:12,275 --> 00:40:15,239
我能多要一些蛋黄酱？
Can I get some extra mayo?

439
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:17,040
- 当然可以 -谢谢

- 行了吗？ -行了

441
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:24,712
那辆梅赛德斯出现了，你别吃了好吗？ There's the Mercedes.
Will you get rid of that stuff?

442
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:42,366
你他妈的干什么？
What the hell are you doin'?

443

是这里吗？ This the place?

444
00:40:54,483 --> 00:40:57,146

still not sure I should do this.

445
00:40:57,487 --> 00:41:01,787
你不必做，但当你听到砸破玻璃时别惊慌 Don't do anything, but when
you hear glass breakin', don't get scared.

446
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:05,723

in the window. Sit tight.

447
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:08,590
来吧，阿克塞尔

-有发现吗？ -咖啡渣。 - You find something?

00:41:52,242 --> 00:41:56,542
-那又如何？ -可知道这东西有什么用？ So?.You know
what this stuff is used for?

451
00:41:56,746 --> 00:41:59,112
人们用热水把它过滤后再饮用 Yeah, some people filter
hot water through it and drink it.

452
00:41:59,582 --> 00:42:05,953
我会带这个回家, 早上用热水把它过滤后再喝 I'll take this home, filter
hot water through it and drink it in the morning.

453
00:42:17,866 --> 00:42:19,000
我们干嘛要躲起来？
What are we hiding for?

454
00:42:19,163 --> 00:42:22,904
可惜你昨天没来 I wanna tell ya, I wish you
would've been with me last night.

455
00:42:23,132 --> 00:42:27,942
发生了什么事？ -我们回家途中去了一间酒吧喝了几杯。 What happened? I stopped
at a joint on the way home to have a couple of drinks.

00:42:27,976 --> 00:42:30,376
-哪一间？ -一间本地的酒吧 - Which one?
- One of the local joints.

457
00:42:31,046 --> 00:42:33,882
有个傢伙走进来，坐在附近 Some guy comes in,
sits down a couple of stools away.

458
00:42:33,947 --> 00:42:38,520
他有一只眼睛这样的眨著 He's got... one of
them eyes that's goin' like this.

459
00:42:38,747 --> 00:42:41,946
我不知道他是否在挑逗我 I didn't know if he was
tryin'to put the make on me or what.

460
00:42:42,257 --> 00:42:44,337
我想今晚带你去 So I thought I'd
take you over there tonight.

461
00:42:44,384 --> 00:42:48,460
让他挑逗你，然后我揍他一顿 Let him have a little
shot at you before I tore his head off.

462
00:42:57,472 --> 00:42:59,273
我们走吧，我要离开这里
Let's go. I wanna get out of here.

463
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:04,273
-能不能别管我 -来吧 Why don't you
get off my back? Come on.

464
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:10,176
行了 I got it.

465
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,566
-这是什么回事？ -我稍后会告诉你 - What the hell's going on?
- I'll tell you later. Come on.

466
00:43:30,438 --> 00:43:31,666
快点，快点 - Hurry up. - Hurry up.

467
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:37,379
把钥匙交给我，我要跟踪他 -你以前开过梅赛德斯没有？ -汽车罢了，我每天开我的车 - Gimme the key. I'm gonna follow 'em.- You
ever driven a Mercedes before? No, but a car is a car.I drive my car every day.

468
00:43:37,571 --> 00:43:39,675
我来开吧，我看过你的车
I'm driving. I've seen your car.

469
00:43:39,948 --> 00:43:41,745
噢，靠，那真令人沮丧。
Oh, shit. That's cold.

470
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:53,388
香蕉在排气管里？你们怎会没发觉有人把香蕉塞进排气管 A banana in your tailpipe? How could
you not notice a man sticking a banana in your tailpipe?

471
00:43:53,695 --> 00:43:55,597
-他令我们分心 -怎样？ - Well, he distracted us, sir.
- And how'd he do that?

472
00:43:55,686 --> 00:43:59,699
他给我们送来一客宵夜，那个服务生走过来… He sent us a late
supper, sir.See, this waiter comes over...

473
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,794
比利，他明白的
Billy, he gets the point.

474
00:44:01,836 --> 00:44:06,206
宵夜？你们吃了什么？ A late supper. And

你有没有被授权这样做的？
You got some kind of warrant for this?

529

先生，你真是多嘴，你是否有事隐瞒著我？ You have a very big mouth, sir. Are
you hiding something from me? Is that what you're doing?

530
00:48:42,748 --> 00:48:45,876
外面那辆保时捷是你的吧？ I bet that's your
Porsche parked outside, isn't it?

have the IRS crawl up your ass with a microscope?

532

seen 'em do it. It's not a pretty sight.

know what you think I am, take me for some kind of fool. Hurry.

been drinking a lot of coffee lately.

所以你很难放松 Well, I think that's why
you have a hard time relaxing.

541

天！你差点让我发心脏病 Jesus Christ.- You

-你们这么晚在这里干嘛？ -你是个自大的婊子养的混蛋，
- What are you doing here so late? You're a cocky son of a bitch, aren't you?

543
00:50:00,692 --> 00:50:05,612
若你还在生那香蕉的气，对不起，我只是需要点私人时间 Look, if you're still mad about the
banana thing, I'm sorry. I just needed a little time to myself.

544
00:50:05,697 --> 00:50:09,699
真希望看到车子故障时你们脸上的表情 I wish I would've saw the
expression on your face when your car conked out.

549
00:50:24,381 --> 00:50:26,351
他在开玩笑，
He meant it as a joke, Billy.

550
00:50:27,252 --> 00:50:30,982
像那条香蕉一样。 等等，我是警察，我明白监视行动的苦况 - Like the bananas.
Wait a minute. I'm a fellow police officer. I know what it's like to be on a stakeout.

551
00:50:31,223 --> 00:50:34,590
那些食物是我的心意 -胡说！ When I sent that food
down, that was from the heart. Bullshit.

552
00:50:36,028 --> 00:50:40,148
为何我们总要吵架？我们都是警察，该一起合作 Why are we always arguin'?.All
three of us are cops. We should be working together.

553
00:50:40,566 --> 00:50:42,329
我们今天辛苦了

lost y'all once today... which means I can do this shit again.

558
00:50:59,383 --> 00:51:02,421
去喝一杯吧，我们交个朋友 Why don't you say we get something

embarrassed if your dick gets hard.

See? That's the whole object of this.

571
00:52:04,782 --> 00:52:07,547

but he won't let you know 'cause he's the boss.

572
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:11,815
老大的那话儿要保持柔软，我没在值班，我的可以变硬 The boss' dick got to stay

596
00:53:43,844 --> 00:53:48,687
-什么事？ 我去看看酒吧那混蛋，比利不会让我胡来 - What's going on?
- I'll check out the asshole at the bar.Billy's gonna make sure that I behave.

597
00:53:49,254 --> 00:53:50,974
有谁告诉我有什么事？
Somebody tell me what's going on.

598
00:53:56,061 --> 00:53:57,756
这次不是说笑 No bullshit this time.

599
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,431
比利，别走开 Just sit tight, Billy.

600
00:54:07,739 --> 00:54:09,673
That'll work.

601
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:21,346
That's right I can't control it.

602
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:24,753
Tonight I can no longer hold it.

603
00:54:25,823 --> 00:54:29,281
Get it up, get it up I can't wait anymore

604
00:54:30,628 --> 00:54:32,963
菲利浦！ Philip!

605
00:54:32,964 --> 00:54:35,432
老兄，怎么了？菲尔
Hey, man, what's happenin', Phil?

606
00:54:35,867 --> 00:54:40,737
我知道是你，他说你不再来了，但我说： 是菲利浦 I knew that was you.He told me it
wasn't, that you don't come here no more. But I said, it's him.

607
00:54:40,805 --> 00:54:43,941
-走开 -是菲利浦 - Get outta here.
- It is Philip. I told you it's Philip, you liar.

608
00:54:44,442 --> 00:54:47,206
-给我亲一下 -我叫你滚开！ Gimme a kiss.
I said, get the hell away.

609
00:54:48,846 --> 00:54:50,974
全部人别动！ Everybody, freeze!

610
00:54:52,783 --> 00:54:54,683
转过身去… Turn around. Turn around.

611
00:54:55,052 --> 00:54:56,972
-菲尔！ -把手放在桌上！ - Phil.
- Get the hands on the table.

612
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:00,850
菲尔！什么事？干嘛这么凶？-菲尔？ Phil! What's wrong,
man?.What's all the hostility, Phil?

613
00:55:01,058 --> 00:55:03,299
-退后 -你拿这支枪搞什么？ - Get back.
- What you doin' with this gun?

614
00:55:03,822 --> 00:55:05,356
我说过了退后 你变了 - I told you to get back.
- You changed, man.

615
00:55:05,529 --> 00:55:08,290
退后，否则我把你他妈的轰掉 Get back. If you don't,
I'll blow your fuckin' brains out.

616
00:55:10,701 --> 00:55:12,898
警察，别动 Police. Move,
and I'll kill you.

617
00:55:14,672 --> 00:55:17,708
别动！转过身去！ Don't move! Turn over!

618
00:55:17,869 --> 00:55:21,345
干得好，你是个出色的警察，知道吗？ Way to go, Rosewood.
You're some kind of cop, you know that?

619
00:55:21,771 --> 00:55:26,549
抱歉骚扰了大家，一切受到控制了 Sorry for the disturbance,
folks.Everything's under control.

620
00:55:36,761 --> 00:55:39,127
塔格特 Taggart

621
00:55:39,497 --> 00:55:43,024
你可否解释为何你和罗斯伍德在值班时间… Would you mind explaining
to me why you two were in a strip bar...

622
00:55:43,234 --> 00:55:45,734
出现在我们警局以外的一间脱衣舞酒吧？ out of our jurisdiction,
when you were still on duty?

623
00:55:45,735 --> 00:55:49,674
长官，在你责罚这两位探员前你该知道一件事 Sir, before you chastise
these two, there's something you should know.

624
00:55:49,729 --> 00:55:55,744
他们所以在脱衣舞酒吧里是因为他们在跟踪我 The only reason they were at a strip bar...
is because they were tailing me, and I went to this place.

625
00:55:55,745 --> 00:55:58,271
他们在外面怀疑我在干什么 These two officers were sitting
outside, wondering what I was doing.

626
00:55:58,749 --> 00:56:01,510
我在里面玩著，我很喜欢那些玩意 I was in having a good time.
I'm into things like that.

627
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:05,921
他们在外面等著，他们之所以走了进去… Anyway, these guys waited
outside, and the only reason they came in...

628
00:56:05,957 --> 00:56:11,190
是因为他们看见两个外衣有异物凸出的可疑人物进去 was because they saw two suspicious-looking gentlemen...
with bulges in their jackets going into the place.

629
00:56:11,162 --> 00:56:14,793
原来那两个傢伙想抢劫 Well, it turns out that these
guys were gonna commit a robbery, sir.

630
00:56:15,032 --> 00:56:19,353
他们静候他们下手，把一宗罪案瓦解了 These men watched them, waited for them
to make their move... and then they foiled the crime.

631
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:22,571
我不知道发生什么事，我当时在看表演 I did not know what was going on.
I was watchin' the show, havin' fun.

632
00:56:22,572 --> 00:56:25,492
我仍然很惊慌，他们一定是有第六感 I'm still freaked out by it.
They must have a sixth sense.

633
00:56:25,576 --> 00:56:29,376
我不知道你怎么教导他们，但他们不是普通的警察 I don't know what you teach
these guys, but they're not just regular cops.

634
00:56:30,343 --> 00:56:36,019
他们是超级警察，他们身上只是欠了一件斗蓬 Okay? They're super cops. And
the only thing missing on these guys are capes.

635
00:56:38,889 --> 00:56:40,356
是真的吗？
Is this what really happened?

636
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:44,394
不是的 No, sir.

637
00:56:44,395 --> 00:56:47,626
谁能把实情告诉我？ Would someone like to
tell me what really happened?

638
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:55,835
福里邀请我们去这间酒吧，我们接受了 Well... Foley invited
us to this bar, and we accepted.

639
00:56:55,936 --> 00:56:59,377
-我们要了苏打水 -对
- We ordered club sodas, sir. - Right.

640
00:56:59,474 --> 00:57:02,612
我们在那里时…
And while we were there...

641
00:57:02,613 --> 00:57:06,947
福里察觉那两个可疑人物，正在虎视眈眈 Foley observed the
two suspects casing the establishment.

642
00:57:07,118 --> 00:57:13,990
我们还不知道发生什么事，他已把其中一人的手枪拿下了 And before we knew what
was going on, he'd already disarmed one of'em.

643
00:57:14,125 --> 00:57:18,585
这次拘捕该归功于福里探员 Detective Foley deserves
all the credit for the arrest, sir.

644
00:57:18,829 --> 00:57:23,366
福里探员，我们感谢你的协助 Detective Foley...
we appreciate your assistance...

645
00:57:23,367 --> 00:57:29,135
但将来我宁愿你在底特律，执行法纪 but in the future, if you want to practice
law enforcement... I would prefer you did it in Detroit.

646
00:57:30,074 --> 00:57:31,909
我明白，对不起
I understand, sir.I'm sorry.

647
00:57:31,939 --> 00:57:38,180
但我想你们俩知道，那超级警察的说法挺管用 But before I go, I just want you
two to know something: The super-cop story was working.

648
00:57:39,116 --> 00:57:44,078
知道吗？它管用的，你们却把它弄乱 Okay? It was working.You
guys just messed it up. Okay?

649
00:57:44,455 --> 00:57:48,858
我还想不透你们搞什么，但这样很好 I'm trying to figure you
guys out, but I haven't yet, but it's cool.

650
00:57:48,959 --> 00:57:54,727
把一个绝妙的谎话弄糟，也没问题 You fuck up a perfectly
good lie, and it's all right.

651
00:57:58,736 --> 00:58:01,762
你们不用办这个案了
You guys are off the case.

652
00:58:01,972 --> 00:58:07,877
佛斯特、麦凯布，你们接手，别让他跑掉
Foster. McCabe. Your turn. Don't lose him.

653
00:58:09,246 --> 00:58:10,508
绝对不会 Not a chance, sir.

654
00:58:12,483 --> 00:58:15,941
你们俩进来我办公室
And you two, in my office.

655
00:58:35,004 --> 00:58:37,564
两位早，要咖啡和甜甜圈吗？ Good morning,
gentlemen.Some coffee and doughnuts?

656
00:58:38,174 --> 00:58:40,870
-什么？ -咖啡和甜甜圈 - What?
- Coffee and doughnuts.

657
00:58:46,348 --> 00:58:47,975
他来了 There he is.

658
00:59:05,421 --> 00:59:08,185
两位探员早，你们是第二队？ Morning, officers.
What? Y'all the second team?

659
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:10,151
我们是第一队 - We're the first team.
- Yeah.

660
00:59:10,561 --> 00:59:14,029
我们不会中香蕉塞进排气管的计 We're not gonna
fall for a banana in the tailpipe.

661
00:59:14,397 --> 00:59:15,400
你们不会中香蕉塞进排气管的计？ You're not gonna
fall for the banana in the tailpipe?

662
00:59:15,408 --> 00:59:18,609
兄弟，应该说得自然一点，像这样： It should be more natural,
brother.lt should flow out.Like this,

663
00:59:18,902 --> 00:59:22,396
我不会中香蕉塞进排气管的计 "Look, man, I ain't
fallin'for no banana in my tailpipe!"

664
00:59:22,572 --> 00:59:26,332
这样自然一点，你跟这个傢伙混得太久了 That's more natural for us.
You've been hanging out with this dude too long.

665
00:59:29,911 --> 00:59:32,047
抱歉，我跟你们开玩笑罢了，我觉得很有趣，对不起 Sorry. I'm just fuckin' with ya.
That's funny to me. Sorry.

666
00:59:33,049 --> 00:59:36,250
-你们想跟上我？ -没问题 So y'all gonna try
to keep up with me? No problem.

667
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:40,188
-这里不是维多麦特兰的家吗？ -我想是的
- Isn't this Victor Maitland's house? - Yeah, I think so.

668
00:59:43,127 --> 00:59:46,224
我看够了，你们可要饮品？ Well, I seen enough. Y'all
want something to drink? Beer or somethin'?

669
00:59:46,363 --> 00:59:49,361
我的行李箱里有些饮料，对不起
I got some stuff in the trunk.Excuse me.

670
01:00:02,046 --> 01:00:06,243
你在放假，看起来却像在进行监视 For a man who claims to be on
vacation, you look like you're on a stakeout.

671
01:00:06,649 --> 01:00:10,313
监视？不是，我在野餐，这里是野餐区 Stakeout?.I'm picnicking.
This is like a picnic area.

672
01:00:18,028 --> 01:00:22,532
我聊得太久了，我想去到处观光了，失陪 Well, guys, I been shootin'the shit long enough.
Time for me to take in some sights. Excuse me.

673
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:17,687
他在干什么？ What's he doing?

674
01:02:17,213 --> 01:02:22,352
你能把它停在个好地方吗，上次停在这里时弄成这样 Can you put this in a good spot?.All
this shit happened the last time I parked here. Thank you.

675
01:02:50,358 --> 01:02:51,223
有何效劳？ May I help you?

676
01:02:52,379 --> 01:02:54,716
是的，我想找维多麦特兰
Yes. I'm lookin'for Victor Maitland.

677
01:02:55,953 --> 01:02:59,444
你知道俱乐部只招待会员的吧？ You realize that
this is a members-only club?

678
01:02:59,822 --> 01:03:01,586
我要跟维多谈谈，是非常，非常，重要的事 But I have to talk to Victor.
It's very, very important.

679
01:03:01,825 --> 01:03:04,325
维多麦特兰，你肯定？
You sure it's Victor Maitland you want?

680
01:03:04,326 --> 01:03:08,923
是，维多麦特兰，灰发男士，皮肤很黑，魔羯座 The gray-haired
gentleman, very dark skin, Capricorn.

681
01:03:10,032 --> 01:03:12,912
不如你把口信给我，我会交给他 Why don't you give me
the message, and I'll take it to him.

682
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:18,073
好，告诉维多，他一周前认识的拉蒙 I guess I can do that. Tell Victor
that Ramon, the fella he met about a week ago...

683
01:03:18,074 --> 01:03:20,669
告诉他拉蒙去过诊所… Tell him that Ramon
went to the clinic today.

684
01:03:21,078 --> 01:03:27,243
我发觉我染了…单纯性十号泡疹 I found out that I have...
herpes simplex ten.

685
01:03:27,683 --> 01:03:31,016
我想维多该找医生检查一下 I think Victor should go
check himself out with his physician...

686
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:34,461
免得病情突发 to make sure everything is fine
before things start fallin' off on the man.

687
01:03:36,759 --> 01:03:38,360
还是你告诉他吧
Perhaps you better tell him that.

688
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:45,024
-这最好不过了 -我也同意 You know, I think
that would be best. So do I.

689
01:04:00,183 --> 01:04:01,016
你好，维多 Hi，Victor

690
01:04:04,087 --> 01:04:04,681
我回来了 I'm back.

691
01:04:12,029 --> 01:04:13,965
大伙儿，别胡来
Look, cous', don't even try it, okay?

692
01:04:16,965 --> 01:04:19,368
你干嘛不快从这儿滚出去？ Why don't you get
the hell outta here, cous'?

693
01:04:19,468 --> 01:04:21,069
他妈的离我远点儿，
Get the fuck away from me, man.

694
01:04:36,238 --> 01:04:42,074
很好，维多，你可否也教他滚开坐下？ That's very good. Could you
teach him to roll over and sit and all that too?

695
01:04:42,707 --> 01:04:50,707
你想怎么样？-谈一下 -我们上次可没有机会谈 -我跟你无话可说。 -好，那就全由我来说吧 - What do you want? - I want to talk to you.Last time we met I
didn't get a chance to talk to you. - I have nothing to say to you.- That's cool. I'll do all the talking.

696
01:04:53,481 --> 01:04:56,418
这是个很好的地方，维克
This is a very nice place, Vic.

697
01:04:56,419 --> 01:04:59,910
你好…我喜欢这里，很好
Hi. I like this. This is nice.

698
01:05:00,588 --> 01:05:03,614
我很高兴你喜欢他，我得使你成为会员
Glad you like it. I must make you a member.

699
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,991
维多，我知道你做著很多勾当 I know that you're
into a lot of crooked shit.

700
01:05:10,665 --> 01:05:13,964
我有个非常好的想法就是你杀了迈克 I have a pretty
good idea that you had Mikey killed.

701
01:05:14,336 --> 01:05:18,606
当我找到证据时，我会狠狠的把你打得稀巴烂。 When I find out for
sure, I'm gonna fuck you up real bad.

702
01:05:19,069 --> 01:05:23,913
是吗？听我说，我难缠的小朋友， Is that so?.Listen
to me, my tough little friend.

703
01:05:24,412 --> 01:05:27,508
我不知道你从哪块石头底下爬过来的… I don't know from
under what stone you crawled...

704
01:05:28,449 --> 01:05:31,951
也不知道你哪得来的关于我的这些荒谬想法 or where you get
these ridiculous ideas about me...

705
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:35,056
但很明显…
but it seems painfully obvious...

706
01:05:35,414 --> 01:05:38,757
你一点也他妈的不知道你在跟谁交手 you haven't the slightest
fucking idea who you're dealing with.

707
01:05:40,128 --> 01:05:43,256
我给你的忠告是…
Now, my advice to you is...

708
01:05:43,465 --> 01:05:50,200
快爬回底特律你的小石头底下，在你被压扁之前，好吗？ crawl back to your little
stone in Detroit... before you get squashed, okay?

709
01:05:50,472 --> 01:05:52,574
请离开这张桌子
Please step away from the table, sir.

710
01:05:53,635 --> 01:05:56,115
-我要走了，维多 -再次见到你真好。 - Gotta go now, Vic.
- Nice meeting you again.

711
01:06:03,218 --> 01:06:04,947
稍后见吧，维多 Catch ya later, Vic.

712
01:06:06,054 --> 01:06:07,817
我巴不得快点 I can't wait.

713
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:25,496
我在某处见过你们吗？你们很面熟呢 Don't I know you guys
from someplace? You look so familiar.

714
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:29,942
福里探员，这件事越来越恼人了 Detective Foley,
this is becoming very irritating.

715
01:06:30,145 --> 01:06:33,012
你为何要骚扰维多麦特兰？
Why are you bothering Victor Maitland?

716
01:06:35,717 --> 01:06:39,209
我的朋友迈克坦丁诺以前替他工作 I had a friend named Michael
Tandino that used to work for Victor Maitland.

717
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:44,340
麦特兰找人杀了他，现在我无法证明，但我找到证据时你会第一个知道。 Maitland had him killed. I can't
prove that right now, but when I do, you'll be the first to know.

718
01:06:46,728 --> 01:06:49,356
别管你能证明什么了，跟我说吧
Forget what you can prove.Talk to me.

719
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,837
好，听著，众所周知，麦特兰是个著名的艺术品商人 Everybody knows Victor
Maitland is a hotshot art dealer, okay?

720
01:06:56,905 --> 01:06:59,738
但我调查过，他不单是买卖艺术品 I did some poking around.
Art's not the only thing that he deals.

721
01:06:59,908 --> 01:07:05,308
我去过他的仓库，看见他们缷下一箱无记名债券 I went to his warehouse.I saw some guys
unloading a crate... that was filled with German bearer bonds.

722
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:11,315
迈克坦丁诺被杀时，恰巧身上也有这样的债券 My friend Michael had bonds like this on him...
coincidently, when he was killed in Detroit.

723
01:07:11,386 --> 01:07:15,027
麦特兰投资在同一样的债券上 Just because he chooses to invest
in the same kind of bonds your friend had...

724
01:07:15,056 --> 01:07:16,546
并不代表他就是杀人凶手
doesn't necessarily mean he's a killer.

725
01:07:16,925 --> 01:07:19,758
他不是投资者，他是个走私贩 The man's not an investor.
He's a smuggler...

726
01:07:19,928 --> 01:07:24,866
不管是债券、毒品，我看见的箱子甚至没有通关 be it bonds or drugs or whatever.
The crate that I saw didn't even pass through customs.

727
01:07:25,025 --> 01:07:29,602
麦特兰收买了一些人因此他的人在海关检查前把货物弄了出来 Maitland is paying someone so his guys
can get the shipments out of customs before they get inspected.

728
01:07:29,603 --> 01:07:33,970
他的手下取货以后，就把毒品或者债券拿出来 When Maitland's guys get their hands on it...
they take the drugs or the bonds out of the crates...

729
01:07:34,042 --> 01:07:40,047
然后在海关发现前把它送回去 and they send it back before
customs even knows what's going on.

730
01:07:40,048 --> 01:07:41,345
你目睹这个情况？
You witnessed all this?

731
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:46,580
除了毒品，但我在仓库到处都能找到咖啡渣 Everything except for the drugs...
but I found coffee grounds all over the warehouse.

732
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:51,124
咖啡渣？ -这之前你说了些事，什么意思？ Coffee grounds? You said
something about that before. What does that mean?

733
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:54,845
把毒品包装在咖啡里，气味会瞒过警犬 Drugs are sometimes packed in
coffee grounds. The scent throws off the dogs.

734
01:07:54,929 --> 01:07:57,022
很好，我们现在怎么办？
Very good, Lieutenant. Now what do we do?

735
01:07:59,267 --> 01:08:02,100
福里探员，我…
Look, Detective Foley...

736
01:08:02,237 --> 01:08:09,573
很抱歉，我真的很想帮你，若你找到毒品就好 I'm sorry.I'd really like to
help you.lf you'd found the drugs, that's one thing.

737
01:08:09,777 --> 01:08:13,770
但你唯一的证据是咖啡渣，我们便拿不到搜查令 But if your only evidence is coffee grounds...
we don't have enough to get a search warrant.

738
01:08:14,015 --> 01:08:19,180
我们可以靠关系… -我们不靠关系拿搜查令的 I know how we can get around...
We don't get around search warrants in Beverly Hills.

739
01:08:20,421 --> 01:08:24,414
塔格特，我要你去调查一下
Taggart.I want you to start checking this out. Yes, sir.

740
01:08:24,425 --> 01:08:27,519
从洛杉矶警察局，联邦调查局和海关著手 Start with the LAPD,
the FBI and the Customs Service.

741
01:08:27,695 --> 01:08:31,495
塔格特，等一下…探长，麦特兰很精明的 Wait a minute.
Maitland is much smarter than that.

742
01:08:31,599 --> 01:08:35,603
若我们到处打探，他会收手，从别处取货 We snoop around, he'll close
down and get his shipments from someplace else.

743
01:08:37,127 --> 01:08:41,104
- 那将会浪费很多时间。 真的？你丰富的经验，令你相信是这样吗？ - It'd be a big waste of time.
- Oh, really?.ls that what your extensive experience leads you to believe?

744
01:08:41,476 --> 01:08:44,377
-我没有在警队… -长官…
- I haven't been on the force... - Sir!

745
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:46,480
该死 Shit.

746
01:08:48,049 --> 01:08:49,986
-就是这个人吗？ 是的，长官
- Is this the man? - Yes, sir.

747
01:08:51,986 --> 01:08:55,786
把维多麦特兰的窗撞破的先生？ Is this the gentleman who
crashed through Victor Maitland's window?

748
01:08:56,157 --> 01:08:59,786
用香蕉把一辆没标志的警车弄坏的人？ Who disabled
an unmarked unit with a banana?

749
01:09:00,161 --> 01:09:01,355
是的，长官 Yes, sir.

750
01:09:01,663 --> 01:09:08,364
引诱塔格特和罗斯蒙特去一间脱衣舞酒吧… Who lured Taggart and
Rosemont into a gross dereliction of duty...

751
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:11,400
导致他们严重失职的人？
at a striptease establishment?

752
01:09:11,872 --> 01:09:16,133
-是罗斯伍德 -是的，长官 It's Rosewood, sir.
Yes, sir.

753
01:09:16,177 --> 01:09:20,614
今早在哈罗俱乐部毁了自助餐的先生是不是他？ Is this the gentleman who
ruined the buffet at the Harrow Club this morning?

754
01:09:21,549 --> 01:09:23,574
是的，长官 Yes, sir.

755
01:09:23,818 --> 01:09:28,846
我打赌在底特律你是你部门的光荣 I just bet you are the
pride of your department in Detroit.

756
01:09:32,827 --> 01:09:36,627
探长，我想在你的办公室见你 Lieutenant, I'd
like to see you in your office.

757
01:09:36,831 --> 01:09:38,662
是，长官 Yes, sir.

758
01:09:41,669 --> 01:09:46,368
今早在哈罗俱乐部毁了自助餐的是不是他？ Is this the man who wrecked
the buffet at the Harrow Club this morning?

759
01:09:47,075 --> 01:09:49,035
小声一点，看在上帝份上。
Lower your voice, for Christ's sake.

760
01:09:50,738 --> 01:09:53,298
-他穿过墙壁也能听到？ -他可以
- Can he hear me through the wall? - Yes, he can.

761
01:10:09,364 --> 01:10:14,302
罗斯伍德，送福里探员回饭店里 Rosewood, take Detective
Foley back to his hotel room...

762
01:10:14,427 --> 01:10:19,807
看著他收拾行李，护送他到本市边境 watch him pack
and，escort him to the city limits.

763
01:10:20,102 --> 01:10:22,502
然后你可以把枪交还给他 When you get there,
you can give him his gun back.

764
01:10:23,578 --> 01:10:27,912
控告你扰乱公安的两项罪名，已经被撤消 The two charges of disturbing
the peace have been dropped against you.

765
01:10:28,082 --> 01:10:30,816
但局长说，如果你回到比佛利山… But the chief says if you
return to the city of Beverly Hills...

766
01:10:30,817 --> 01:10:36,754
就会重新控告你，你就会受到法律制裁 the charges will be reinstated...
and you will be prosecuted to the limit of the law.

767
01:10:37,258 --> 01:10:39,749
-长官，我可否发言？ -什么？
- Sir, may I say something? - What?

768
01:10:39,761 --> 01:10:45,256
-他看来有足够的线索… -你可想告诉局长？ He seems to have enough to
follow up... You want to tell that to the chief?

769
01:10:45,257 --> 01:10:50,270
-不想 -那我提议你快点去 - No, sir.
- Then I suggest you get moving.

770
01:10:50,271 --> 01:10:52,466
来吧，阿克塞尔 Come on.

771
01:11:10,491 --> 01:11:14,086
好的，我明天看看再回复你吧 Right. Let me check on
that tomorrow and get right back to you.

772
01:11:14,429 --> 01:11:16,056
谢谢 Thank you.

773
01:11:16,264 --> 01:11:18,391
-你好
-维多，你好
-hi
-vic, hi

774
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:23,171
-坐下，我没有打扰你吧 -当然没有 Sit down. Hope I'm
not interrupting. Don't be silly.

775
01:11:23,327 --> 01:11:30,270
珍妮，有个来自底特律的男人…他说他是迈克坦丁诺的朋友 There's a gentleman
from Detroit who says he's a friend ofTandino.

776
01:11:30,611 --> 01:11:35,173
他昨天来过公司问了我一些古怪的问题 He came by the office yesterday
and asked me all sorts of odd questions.

777
01:11:35,383 --> 01:11:36,423
对不起，亲爱的 Excuse me, darling.

778
01:11:36,685 --> 01:11:44,685
我相信他的名字是福里, 既然你是迈克的好朋友, 我想知道或许你熟悉那个家伙 I believe his name is Foley.Since you were such a
good friend of Michael's... I was wondering if you were perhaps familiar with the fellow?

779
01:11:45,693 --> 01:11:48,423
我们一同长大，他是我邻居
We grew up in the same neighborhood.

780
01:11:48,696 --> 01:11:50,891
真的？你最近可有见过他？
Really? Have you seen him lately?

781
01:11:52,633 --> 01:11:54,602
他昨天来过 He came in yesterday.

782
01:11:54,692 --> 01:11:58,096
什么？他来过这里？ What? Came by here?

783
01:11:58,539 --> 01:12:00,097
噢

784
01:12:00,475 --> 01:12:02,475
还有呢？ And?

785
01:12:03,678 --> 01:12:07,348
他告诉我迈克被人杀死了
He told me Mikey had been killed.

786
01:12:07,478 --> 01:12:12,854
是，我知道， Yes. Yes, I know.

787
01:12:14,085 --> 01:12:20,157
还有呢？ 没有了, 他离开后我就没见过他了 - And then?
That's it. He left, and I haven't seen him since.

788
01:12:21,896 --> 01:12:25,127
珍妮，你可知道他住在哪里？ You wouldn't, by any
chance, know where Foley is staying?

789
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,927
我有些他可能有用的资料 I have some information
which just might be helpful for him.

790
01:12:32,039 --> 01:12:34,371
我不知道 I have no idea.

791
01:12:36,944 --> 01:12:38,468
很好 Yes.

792
01:12:39,447 --> 01:12:40,971
很好 Yes.

793
01:12:41,949 --> 01:12:43,541
很好 Yes.

794
01:12:43,951 --> 01:12:48,189
希望我们没有太打扰到你 -没问题 Well, I hope we didn't
disturb you too much. No problem.

795
01:12:48,251 --> 01:12:51,331
我们改天吃晚饭，好吗？ 那将令人愉快。 - We'll have dinner soon, yes?
- Why, that would be lovely.

796
01:12:51,454 --> 01:12:53,285
保重 Take care.

797
01:13:04,605 --> 01:13:10,202
比利，我看过那些提货单，他们今天会有另一批货到来 I read the manifest, all right?
They're expecting another shipment today.

798
01:13:10,445 --> 01:13:12,307
-博戈米尔… -算了吧 - If Bogomil...
- Never mind Bogomil!

799
01:13:12,547 --> 01:13:15,987
这是让我们破案的机会 This is a chance for me and you to
blow this case wide open. What do you say?

800
01:13:16,551 --> 01:13:20,751
-但愿我可以，但我不行 -为什么？
- I wish I could, but I can't. - Why?

801
01:13:20,955 --> 01:13:23,219
因为博戈米尔会杀死我
Because Bogomil would kill me.

802
01:13:26,461 --> 01:13:27,689
比利 Billy.

803
01:13:27,762 --> 01:13:31,799
我不能载你去画廊
I'm not driving you to the art gallery.

804
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:35,394
只消两分鐘，我的朋友，珍妮会让我们进入麦特兰的仓库 - It'll just take a few minutes.My
friend, Jenny, will let us in Maitland's warehouse.

805
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:37,563
那批货到达时我们就能当场抓到他们 We can be there when
the shipment comes in and nail 'im!

806
01:13:37,605 --> 01:13:39,664
你怎么能肯定它是毒品？
How can you be sure it'll be drugs?

807
01:13:40,141 --> 01:13:46,145
我有直觉，明白吗？一种比佛利山以外的破案技巧 - I got a hunch, okay?.That's a
technique by which crimes outside of Beverly Hills get solved.

808
01:13:46,146 --> 01:13:48,706
你为何不向博戈米尔提及这批货？ Why didn't you
tell Bogomil about this shipment?

809
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:50,991
他做什么都依规矩办事
Bogomil does everything by the book.

810
01:13:51,152 --> 01:13:54,144
我开始相信这个城市里的人都是机械人 I'm starting to think
everybody in this town is a robot.

811
01:13:54,155 --> 01:13:57,022
这件事对我很重要
This thing is very personal to me.

812
01:13:59,193 --> 01:14:02,959
他只叫我开车送你离城 All he asked me to
do was drive you out of town.

813
01:14:03,197 --> 01:14:07,998
现在我连这件事都办不好，天
Now I'm gonna screw that up too.

814
01:14:08,269 --> 01:14:12,803
比利，我爱你，我刚爱上了你
I love you.I just fell in love with you.

815
01:14:15,810 --> 01:14:20,042
珍妮，你好吗？这是我的朋友，比利罗斯伍德…珍妮桑玛斯 This is my good
buddy Billy Rosewood. This is Jenny Summers.

816
01:14:20,982 --> 01:14:22,882
-你好 -比利是比佛利山警察 - Billy's a Beverly Hills cop.
- How do you do?

817
01:14:22,883 --> 01:14:25,386
-你好吗？ -这是瑟奇 That's Serge.
Yo, Serge.

818
01:14:26,815 --> 01:14:29,220
瑟奇，可否给你的朋友来一杯咖啡？
Will you get my friend an espresso?

819
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:31,592
要不要加柠檬碎片？
You want it with a lemon twist?

820
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:38,491
-好的，如果不是很麻烦 -不麻烦，别傻 Yeah, sure, if it's no bother.
No, don't be stupid.

821
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:42,336
亚斯里，维多麦特兰今天来过这里打听你 Victor Maitland was
here asking questions about you today.

822
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:44,868
他的态度很古怪
I'm telling you he was acting real weird.

823
01:14:45,072 --> 01:14:47,909
我来这儿的原因是想再去那间仓库 The reason I came down here is
'cause I want to get back inside the warehouse.

824
01:14:48,098 --> 01:14:54,015
我陪你去好吗？ -你和瑟奇在画廊工作，不是警察 How about I go with you? You
work here with Serge in an art gallery. You're not a cop.

825
01:14:54,338 --> 01:14:58,516
如果这件事跟迈克的死有关，我就要去看看 If this has anything to do
with Mikey getting killed, I want to check it out.

826
01:14:58,553 --> 01:15:00,953
我没有时间跟你争论 I don't have time to
stand here and argue with you.

827
01:15:01,222 --> 01:15:05,488
我去拿钥匙，我们在途中争论吧 Wait a second. Let me get
my keys, and we'll argue on the way.

828
01:15:09,096 --> 01:15:12,816
比利，你坐在这里监视著，我叫你才可以行动 Your job's to sit out here
and observe things. I'll come out and get you.

829
01:15:12,964 --> 01:15:14,864
- 为何我不能进去？
- I don't see why I can't come in.

830
01:15:14,936 --> 01:15:19,976
因为你是本地的警察，没有充分的证据就是非法搜查 'Cause you're a cop in this town. You go
in without probable cause, they'll call it an illegal search...

831
01:15:20,571 --> 01:15:22,971
你知道的或是他们没有教你这个？ or didn't they
teach you that in cop school?

832
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:25,470
别走开，我找到证据就会叫你
If I find some evidence, I'll come get you.

833
01:15:25,947 --> 01:15:26,946
但你不能… - But you can't...

834
01:15:26,947 --> 01:15:33,787
放心吧，如果有突发的事情我会来找你的 - But nothin'.Just be cool. If anything
jumps off, I'll get ya, all right? I promise, okay?.Thank you.

835
01:15:33,955 --> 01:15:37,254
你可会让我独自进去？ Any chance you're gonna give
me that key and let me go in by myself?

836
01:15:37,458 --> 01:15:40,450
不行 No chance.

837
01:15:40,962 --> 01:15:43,863
该死，来吧 Fuck. Come on.

838
01:16:28,909 --> 01:16:32,429
-看来他们已经来过 -你想找什么？ - Looks like they been here already.
- What exactly are you looking for?

839
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:40,480
这个，这个从外国来的箱子还没有通关的（加州比佛利山霍利斯本顿画廊） This. This is a crate
from overseas. Hasn't passed through customs yet.

840
01:16:47,094 --> 01:16:49,255

你指望我会相信这个报告？

局长，实情就如探长所说一样 Happened just like
the lieutenant said, Chief.

976

你的谎话真了得
You were lyin' your ass off.

981
01:37:35,339 --> 01:37:38,967
到医院检查你的肩膀吧 Why don't you go to the
hospital and get your shoulder looked at?

982
01:37:39,576 --> 01:37:41,806
对不起，长官 Excuse me, sir.

983

你可否帮我一个忙？ I was wondering if

01:37:54,452 --> 01:37:58,395
我想请你打给我的老板陶德探员 I was hoping that you could call
on my Inspector Todd, my boss back home...

986
01:38:00,363 --> 01:38:03,627
帮我澄清，但没关系，反正我也会失业 and straighten things out for me, but that's
all right.I guess I'm just out of a job. It's cool though.

987
01:38:03,867 --> 01:38:05,528
我会留在比佛利山 I think I'm gonna stay in
Beverly Hills.I like it out here.

me off, but I'm moved by the gesture. Thanks.

994
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:41,503
博戈米尔命令我们，要确保你离开本市 Bogomil ordered us
to make sure you got out of town.

995
01:38:43,173 --> 01:38:44,609
不要紧，要紧的是 That doesn't even matter to me.
You know what matters?

你们来了，我很激动，喉咙也哽咽了 That you came. I'm all choked up.
I got a lump in my throat

997

-先生，这里 -谢谢 - Here you go, sir.

Hills Police Department is picking that up.

1000
01:38:58,955 --> 01:39:04,660

last straw.That was the last straw.You are too nice.

你们的浴袍出售吗？ Sir, do you sell those
Beverly Palm robes down here?

01:39:16,106 --> 01:39:21,609
比利，你救了我一命，我不知道可有机会报答你 You saved my life. I
don't think I'll ever be able to repay you.

1005
01:39:21,610 --> 01:39:25,911
但为了表示我的谢意，我要你收下这件舒适的浴袍 But as a token of my
appreciation, I want you to have this fine robe.

1006
01:39:25,982 --> 01:39:30,351
你这辈子每次洗澡时，都会想起我们的友谊 Each time you shower and
you're dripping wet, think of our friendship.

1007
01:39:30,987 --> 01:39:34,855
我要你想起阿克塞尔福里 我爱你，比利 I want you to think
about Axel Foley. I love you, Billy.

比利，结帐吧
Take care of the tab, would you?

1011
01:39:48,405 --> 01:39:50,236

That's all right.You keep it as a souvenir.

1014
01:39:57,214 --> 01:40:00,240
我袋里已经有三件了
I already have three of them in my bag.

1015
01:40:03,854 --> 01:40:05,446
-这里 -谢谢你，先生 There you go.
Take it easy.

1016
01:40:05,589 --> 01:40:10,861
不说声再见吗？ -你们不是要跟著我到边境吗 You're not gonna say good-bye?
Ain't you guys gonna tail me to the city limits anyway?

1017
01:40:11,417 --> 01:40:14,725
-是的 -我猜你们会的 Yes, we are.
I figured you would.

1018
01:40:14,831 --> 01:40:17,061
我想停下来去喝杯酒 I was thinking about stopping
off and getting something to drink.

1019
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:20,641
- 我们猜你会的-你们可会陪我去？
- We sort of figured you would.- That mean you're gonna join me?

1020
01:40:21,705 --> 01:40:25,505
不了，我们仍在值班
I don't think so. We're still on duty.

1021
01:40:25,709 --> 01:40:28,872
我相信一杯啤酒不会害死我们的，比利 Well, I don't think
one beer's gonna kill us, Billy.

1022
01:40:29,212 --> 01:40:31,908
对，听塔格特的话，放松点
That's right.Listen to Taggart. Lighten up.

1023
01:40:32,415 --> 01:40:34,542
一杯啤酒不会害死我们的
One drink's not gonna kill us.

1024
01:40:36,119 --> 01:40:40,249
但要是你们落后得太远，不要害怕，按喇叭知道吗？ Hey, guys... if you fall
too far behind, don't be afraid to honk, okay?

1025
01:40:40,690 --> 01:40:42,282
我们去哪里？ Where we goin' anyway?

1026
01:40:42,526 --> 01:40:44,858
放心，跟着我就行了
Don't worry about it. Just follow my lead.

1027

我知道有个好地方，你们会喜欢的，相信我吧 I know the perfect
place.You guys will love it. Trust me.
