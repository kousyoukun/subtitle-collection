1
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,868
Truck looks great.
There must be a Fuckin' Fortune Here.

2
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,120
I know...
Let's not in front of him, alright?

3
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,497
OK, no problem, no problem.

4
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,499
Tell me somethin', fellas,
what's goin' on? Shit.

5
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,042
I been here too long. Talk to me.

6
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,252
Just give us a minute.

7
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,587
I ain't got no more minutes. Check
this out. I want you to see somethin'.

8
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,966
You can't get no cleaner than this.
These are very popular with children.

9
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,260
You know what this is in here?
A federal tax stamp.

10
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,679
You can't get no cleaner than that!
Talk to me! Tell me somethin'.

11
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,598
So go into business yourself
if it's such a great fuckin' deal.

12
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,141
I would, but I ain't from Detroit.

13
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,435
I don't even know nobody in town
that can handle a job this big,

14
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,271
but you all got
all the connections, you know.

15
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,231
Tell me somethin', shit,
I'm a businessman.

16
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,108
- Do what you wanna do.
- It ain't easy to get rid of this shit.

17
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,110
I know, but I'm a businessman,
this is my thing.

18
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,736
I'm doin' business here.

19
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,822
Warm up the truck.
Let's get the fuck outta here.

20
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,118
- That's what I'm talkin' about.
- You're a sharp kid, I like you.

21
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,120
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

22
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,373
Cousin, my man, don't dash yet.
This is like two grand to me.

23
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,500
- This doesn't look like $5,000.
- Let me see that.

24
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,794
The deal's for 5,000.
That's about 2,000. Count it yourself.

25
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,379
You know what, this pisses me off.

26
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,464
I told my people it was
supposed to be five grand here,

27
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,258
and look at this shit, they stiffed us.

28
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,260
No, they stiffed you,
'cause I want my money, man.

29
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,304
Son of a bitch, you can't
count on anybody today,

30
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,806
but I tell you what, let's not
fuckin' hassle about it now.

31
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,267
Take the two fucking grand
and on the next score,

32
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,935
I promise I'll make it up to you.

33
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,520
Look, don't jerk me off, all right?

34
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,147
Jerk somebody else off,
this is bullshit.

35
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:54,650
I need $5,000 dollars,
not 2,000 thing, don't do this to me.

36
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,944
Don't be unreasonable.
You're not dealin' with Johnny Bananas.

37
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,155
- I got you covered.
- I got no idea what Johnny Banana,

38
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:01,324
but can I have my money...
Look, can I say it slow for you.

39
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,826
I need five thousand dollars!

40
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,370
Read my lips:
Five thousand dollars, is what I need.

41
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,456
This is bullshit here.
I can't do nothin' with that.

42
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,416
If you want to be a fuckin' asshole,
you can take the whole load

43
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,751
and smoke 'em yourself in the park.

44
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,628
- I don't smoke Lucky Strike.
- I got people I gotta answer to.

45
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,339
- I smoke King Size Kent.
- I can't make a price of my...

46
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,759
Fuck this.
Nice doin' business with you, kid.

47
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,678
Hey, buddy, what you doin' here?

48
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,722
Officers, do you know
what just happened?

49
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,975
You ain't gonna believe this shit.
The truck, it just stopped, man!

50
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,354
It just stopped! You got some
jumper cables, you give me a jump?

51
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,522
Hey... don't I know you
from someplace?

52
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,399
No, that ain't me, I'm from Buffalo.

53
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,405
Both you guys, break out some ID.

54
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,370
Let's get the fuck outta here!

55
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,381
Shit! What the fuck?

56
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,304
Oh, shit.

57
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,352
Freeze, asshole!

58
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,196
Foley, we should've known it was you.

59
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,788
Hey, Axel, way to go!

60
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,249
- I don't understand.
- I don't have time, Jeffrey.

61
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,042
Todd's lookin' for you,
he's really pissed.

62
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,586
He said this is your
worst fuck-up ever.

63
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,297
Personally, I don't think that's true.
He's not in there.

64
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,923
Yeah, I can see that, Jeff.

65
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,593
If you'd busted these guys,
maybe he wouldn't have been so mad.

66
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,970
Now I heard you got caught up
haggling for money?

67
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,430
$2,000 wasn't enough money.

68
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,098
If I took it, those guys
woulda known I was a cop.

69
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:39,810
- Todd's gonna tear you another asshole.
- Don't go anywhere.

70
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,854
I'm not sayin'
you did anything wrong.

71
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,523
If you had busted these guys
it would've worked out better.

72
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,317
That's all I'm sayin'.
Where you goin' now?

73
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,068
I'm gonna go get my shit
and get outta here.

74
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,612
No, big mistake, big mistake.

75
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,738
- Want my advice?
- No.

76
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,323
- You know what I would do?
- No, I don't.

77
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,366
Talk to him.
He'll be right back.

78
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,952
Get away from me or I'm gonna
shoot you. No time for you today.

79
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,787
You know what I would do?

80
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,790
Just lighten up. I'm not listening
to you. I'm not listening.

81
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,792
You're makin' it a lot worse
for yourself.

82
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,836
This is great, thank you guys.

83
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,713
Hey, Axel, you got a cigarette?

84
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,509
- Did you write that one?
- That's what I'm tryin' to tell you.

85
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,303
Everybody knows about you
and the truck.

86
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,930
Jeffrey, will you listen to me?

87
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,224
I am not listening to you,
I'm ignoring you.

88
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,643
Great! Great, real mature.

89
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,395
I am not listening to Jeffrey,
but he's still talking.

90
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,232
- I am not listening to you!
- I really hate when you do that.

91
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,942
- Then stop then.
- It's childish!

92
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,319
- Is that fuckin' Foley in here?
- Oh, shit.

93
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,154
There's Todd, it's show time, OK?

94
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,282
I know what you're gonna say...

95
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,827
Where the fuck you come off
goin' undercover without authorization?

96
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,496
What the fuck is this all about?

97
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,581
You wanna play some
fuckin' bullshit cowboy cop,

98
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,416
go do it in somebody else's precinct.

99
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,168
Don't you want to hear
my side of the story?

100
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,920
What's your fuckin' side of the story?

101
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,298
Let's hear your side of the story.

102
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,801
Axel, I'm not takin'
any more of this shit from you.

103
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:56,345
You know how much this little stunt
is gonna cost this city?

104
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,389
I don't think cost
is the issue here, sir.

105
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,183
I think the issue should be my
blatant disregard for proper procedure.

106
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,269
You damn right, wise-ass!

107
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,105
The mayor called the chief.
The chief called the deputy chief.

108
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,107
The deputy chief just
chewed my ass out!

109
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,526
You see I don't have
any bit of it left, don't you!

110
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,946
Where in the fuck did you get a
truckload of cigarettes from anyway?

111
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,656
From the Dearborn hijack.

112
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,367
The Dearborn hijack?
That bust went down last week.

113
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,202
That truck is supposed to be
in the damn pound!

114
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,537
I tried to tell you.

115
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,664
Jeffrey, this is none
of your fuckin' business.

116
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:24,790
This is not my locker.

117
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,502
Listen, Axel, no more
of these setups, you understand?

118
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,630
You're a good cop.
You got great potential,

119
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,841
but you don't know every fuckin' thing.

120
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,635
And I'm tired
of takin' the heat for your ass.

121
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,054
One more time
and you're out on the street.

122
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,889
- Do you understand me?
- Let me tell you...

123
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,891
Do you understand me?

124
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,103
Yeah, I understand.

125
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,396
Boss.

126
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:51,734
The chief ain't chew it all out,
you still got a little ass there.

127
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,736
Don't fuck with me, Axel.

128
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,072
Not now. Go on, go home.

129
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,820
Hey!

130
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,078
Hey, man!

131
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,538
- How you doin'?!
- All right.

132
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,498
I see you're still breakin'
in people's houses.

133
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,668
What'd you expect with that lock?
Why didn't you buy a real fuckin' lock?

134
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,629
I don't need no lock, I got my pistol.
I pop a cap in somebody.

135
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,382
I can't afford no electrical bill.
Close my refrigerator.

136
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,009
You got groceries
and shit all inside there.

137
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,011
- Look at you!
- Yeah.

138
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,515
- Yo, man, when you'd get out?
- I walked out six months ago.

139
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,809
You got out six months ago,
and you're just comin' now?

140
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:52,062
They got me out a year early for,
you know, good time,

141
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,939
and I went out to California
to get some sun.

142
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,943
- I got to show you somethin'.
- I ain't seen you in two years.

143
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,491
Ten thousand Deutsche Marks.

144
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,285
- Deutsche Mark?
- Yeah.

145
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:07,536
What is that?

146
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,164
They're bearer bonds.
They're bonds. Untraceable.

147
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,373
You stole 'em?

148
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,668
- No. It's not...
- I don't wanna hear it.

149
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,378
I'm sorry I even asked.

150
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,547
- It's just good to see you, man.
- I missed you, man.

151
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,007
- Yeah.
- I missed you.

152
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,593
What were you doin'
in California, anyway?

153
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,344
- I was workin'.
- Workin' where?

154
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,722
- Guess.
- I don't know, where were you workin'?

155
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,140
Beverly Hills.

156
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,852
- What were you doin'?
- You ain't gonna believe this man.

157
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,605
- What?
- I was a security guard.

158
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,902
Who the fuck's gonna hire you
as a security guard?

159
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:41,862
Jenny Summers.

160
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,238
Jenny Summers?!

161
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,117
Oh, man, I haven't seen Jenny
in years! What she up to?

162
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,744
Axel, she's doin' great, right?

163
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,412
She's the manager of this art gallery,

164
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,582
the Hollis Benton Art Gallery
out in Beverly Hills.

165
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,543
It's like a world famous place.
You ever hear of it?

166
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,545
Yeah, I buy all of my art there.

167
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,882
Eight ball, corner pocket,
two cushions.

168
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,717
Fifty bucks you don't make that shot.

169
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,677
- Bullshit.
- A hundred.

170
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,845
You got a bet.

171
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:16,980
What are you gonna do.

172
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,274
You're just as bright
as you always were.

173
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:23,153
Twenty, 40, 60, 80, take it.
Have a party.

174
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,113
Pleasure doin' business with you.

175
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,575
What the fuck you gonna do?

176
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:31,119
Miss, excuse me,
two more Scotch and sodas.

177
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,084
I got a great idea.

178
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,544
I got a great idea!

179
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,797
Let's steal a car.

180
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,802
Are you serious?

181
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,471
I'm a fuckin' police officer,
I can't steal cars no more.

182
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,847
- What's wrong with you?
- So what?

183
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,642
Remember the time
you stole that car, man?

184
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,477
A fuckin' Cadillac.

185
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,566
We had to go and drive it
on the expressway.

186
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,528
You fucking maniac.

187
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,575
I also remember you had to go to jail
behind that shit, too.

188
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,952
That wasn't a jail,
it was a state school.

189
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,329
State school is jail
when you're 15 years old.

190
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:18,875
Not jail, man, that's like...
That's like day camp compared to jail.

191
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,004
How come you didn't tell on me
when you got caught?

192
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,591
- You didn't tell we were together?
- You don't know?

193
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,804
- You don't know?
- No.

194
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,891
It's because I love you, man.

195
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:42,608
One more round.

196
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,072
Hold still, Mike.
I gotta open the door, OK?

197
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,533
Balance yourself.
OK, here we go.

198
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,373
I'm openin' the door now, OK?
Here we go. All right, here we go.

199
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,625
Axel!

200
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,924
Hey, Mikey. Where've you been?

201
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,551
What's up, Zack?

202
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,136
What do you got there, Mikey?

203
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,555
Yeah, what's this, your laundry?

204
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,561
I swear to Christ, Zack,
I was gonna bring 'em back.

205
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,229
- Oh, you get lost?
- No.

206
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,691
I came... I came here to see
my friend, I had 'em with me.

207
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,443
I figured, you know...

208
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,904
What are you doing?

209
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,239
What am I supposed to do here, Mikey?

210
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,909
Zack, there was a whole box
full of those things there,

211
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,578
I took a couple of 'em. I didn't
think anybody was gonna miss 'em.

212
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,538
I figured I'd take 'em...

213
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,832
- Shut up.
- I'm sorry.

214
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,751
- I'm sorry.
- No, shut up.

215
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,589
- Man, please.
- Just shut up, Mikey.

216
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,261
I swear...

217
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,768
I swear, if you ever
show your face out there again...

218
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,645
- I won't.
- Ever.

219
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,064
- I won't, I promise you.
- Ever!

220
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:07,109
Man, I'm sorry.
I fucked up, I'm sorry.

221
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,652
- OK.
- I'm sorry.

222
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,988
- OK.
- Ever. All right.

223
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,809
Axel... I thought I told you
to go to the hospital

224
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,145
and get that bump
on your head checked out.

225
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,231
- My head is all right, man.
- It's not a request, Axel.

226
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,163
Boss. Boss.

227
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,832
Can I talk to you for a minute? Look...

228
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,251
I heard a rumor that you're
gonna use Rand on this case,

229
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,712
and between the two of us,
the guy doesn't know the time of day.

230
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,505
Don't mess with me now, Axel.

231
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,425
This is the first time he's
left his desk in 12 years.

232
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,178
At least he's had 12 years.

233
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,639
Anyway, it's a homicide case
and it belongs to Rand.

234
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,224
Now, go to the hospital!

235
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,560
Well, you don't mind if I
ask around a little bit, do you?

236
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,604
Don't do a damn thing!
It's Rand's case.

237
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,898
Your ass is skating
on thin ice as it is.

238
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,942
Hey, look, we're talkin'
about a friend of mine here!

239
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,320
Yes, we are, aren't we?

240
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,197
Now, let's take a close look at that.

241
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:39,451
One, a hoodlum friend.
Two, a professional hit.

242
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,828
Three, in a cop's apartment.

243
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,623
This whole thing stinks to high heaven.

244
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,541
How you know
it was a professional hit?

245
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,544
I didn't just walk into this town
from the cotton fields!

246
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,839
Whoever killed your friend wasn't
worried about your little narrow ass.

247
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:56,718
If they were, you'd be lyin'
beside him in that meat wagon.

248
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,930
Just don't do a damn thing.
Stay outta this!

249
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,932
Look, I got some
vacation time comin' to me.

250
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,892
I wanna take my vacation now.

251
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,394
Stay away from this case, Axel.

252
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,397
No, it's just that I feel I need
a little vacation, that's all.

253
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,739
All right, as soon as you're finished
at the hospital, you're on vacation.

254
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:18,990
Thank you.

255
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,160
But if you decide
to butt into this case,

256
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,996
it'll be the longest vacation
you ever heard of.

257
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,006
Checking in today, sir?

258
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,342
That depends,
is this hotel real expensive?

259
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,386
Not for Beverly Hills.
Can I get your bags for you?

260
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,141
Yeah, that's my bag in the front seat.

261
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:23,198
I'm sorry, sir, we just have
nothing available tonight.

262
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,450
May I suggest next time
you call for a reservation,

263
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,078
you do it at least a week in advance?

264
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,038
Thank you.

265
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,374
- Hi.
- The nerve of some people, huh?

266
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,708
May I help you?

267
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,044
Yes, you have a reservation
for an Axel Foley.

268
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,379
Well, let's see.

269
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,967
I'm sorry, I don't see anything
under that name.

270
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:46,471
Oh, check Rolling Stone Magazine's
Axel Foley.

271
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:47,973
That's what it is.

272
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,475
OK.

273
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,436
No, no Rolling Stone, no Axel Foley.

274
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,230
- I'm sorry, sir.
- That's all right.

275
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,607
You guys just probably just
made some mistake with reservations.

276
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,567
Just give me another room,
and I'll go up and go to sleep.

277
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,278
I'm sorry, sir,
but there are no rooms available.

278
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,242
Don't you think I realize
what's going on here, miss?

279
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,576
Who do you think I am?

280
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,745
Don't you think I know if I was some
hot-shot from outta town

281
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,331
that pulled inside here and you guys
made a reservation mistake,

282
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,543
I'd be the first one to get a room,
and I'd be upstairs relaxing right now!

283
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:18,211
Well, I'm not some
hot-shot from outta town,

284
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,422
I'm a small reporter from
Rolling Stone Magazine,

285
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,924
that's in town to do an exclusive
interview with Michael Jackson

286
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,844
that's gonna be picked up by every
major magazine in the country!

287
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,347
I was gonna call the article "Michael
Jackson Is Sitting On Top Of The World,"

288
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,099
but now I think I
might well just call it,

289
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,851
"Michael Jackson
Can Sit on Top of the World

290
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,936
Just As Long As He Doesn't
Sit in the Beverly Palm Hotel

291
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,396
Because There's No Niggers
Allowed in There!"

292
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:41,067
Excuse me, sir, it seems that we
do have a last-minute cancellation.

293
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:44,779
There is a room available.
It's a suite, but...

294
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,906
I'll only charge
you the single room rate.

295
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,659
Thank you, I'm sorry I got upset.
It's probably from jet lag.

296
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,036
- I'm very tired.
- I understand.

297
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,289
- What's the rate, anyway?
- That'll be 235 dollars a night, sir.

298
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,712
Fine. Fine.

299
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,839
And that'll be suite 1035.

300
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,299
- Thank you very much.
- Yes, sir.

301
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,551
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

302
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,471
If Michael calls,
tell him what room I'm in.

303
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,972
Of course, sir.

304
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,703
- How you are doing today?
- Hi.

305
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,790
I'm fine, my name is Serge,
and how can I help you?

306
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,043
Yeah, I'm looking
for Miss Jenny Summers.

307
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,796
She's very busy today.

308
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,339
Maybe you give me your name.

309
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:30,135
- My name's Axel Foley.
- And what it's pertaining?

310
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,886
I didn't understand what you said.

311
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:35,223
Pertaining...
What it's meaning... regarding?

312
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:38,059
Oh, what's it regarding?
I'm an old acquaintance of hers.

313
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:41,312
Donny. One moment.

314
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:47,527
Donny, run and tell Ms. Summers
that Mr. Achmed Foley to see her.

315
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:50,280
- No, Axel Foley. Axel.
- Achmel, Achwel?

316
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,781
Axel.

317
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,951
Foley's here to see her.
He's a old acquaintance.

318
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,745
- Donny, this is... Cover this up.
- I'm sorry.

319
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,832
Like a breast of a dog
to scrub for the customer.

320
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,585
- It's not sexy. It's animal.
- No, it's not sexy at all.

321
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,921
May I offer you something to drink?
Wine, a cocktail...

322
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:11,050
- Espresso?
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

323
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,469
I make it myself back there
with the little lemon twist.

324
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,472
- It's good. You should try it.
- No, I'm... I'm fine.

325
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,683
I see you look at this piece.

326
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,060
Yeah, I was wondering how much
something like this went for.

327
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,854
One hundred and thirty thousand dollar.

328
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,106
- Get the fuck outta here!
- No! No, I cannot.

329
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,859
It's serious, because
it's very important piece.

330
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,653
- Have you ever sold one of these?
- Sell it yesterday to a collector.

331
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:33,823
- Get the fuck outta here!
- No, I'm serious! I sell it myself.

332
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,076
Axel Foley, what on earth
are you doing here?

333
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,286
How you doin'?

334
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,914
I'm fine! Hold a second,
I'll be right down.

335
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,124
Great, excuse me, Serge.

336
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,128
- What are you doing here?
- How you doin'?

337
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:50,256
- Oh, God, it's good to see you.
- Same here.

338
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,091
- How have you been?
- I been... Look at you!

339
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,635
- You like?
- Yes!

340
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,136
- Is it good?
- You gettin' old.

341
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,971
Fuck you.

342
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:58,640
- What is this?
- A moustache.

343
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,267
- Peach fuzz.
- No, that's man style now.

344
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,104
You have some place
where we can talk real quick?

345
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,440
Well, yeah. Right over there.

346
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:08,983
- Great.
- Come on.

347
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,486
- I can't believe how you filled out.
- Yeah, I filled out.

348
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:14,322
No, it looks good though.
Sit down.

349
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:18,993
I wanna talk to you about Mikey.

350
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,204
Oh, is he in trouble again?

351
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,625
He's dead.

352
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,295
What?

353
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:33,258
He's dead. He came to Detroit
and somebody killed him.

354
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,262
I don't believe this.

355
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,526
Look, I can't right now.
I'll be up in a second.

356
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:57,073
Mikey mentioned that you
helped him get a job.

357
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,285
Yeah...

358
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:05,039
The guy who owns this gallery
hired him as a favor to me.

359
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,041
Who's this guy?

360
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,836
His name is Victor Maitland.

361
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:13,589
He was working for Victor
at the gallery's warehouse.

362
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:17,135
Look, Axel, I can't talk right now,
I have to go upstairs.

363
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:18,886
That's cool.

364
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,182
I'll call you later on, and we'll
get together later and talk, OK?

365
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,684
Sure.

366
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,645
Be good.

367
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,072
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

368
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,701
- I have a delivery for Victor Maitland.
- I'll take it right upstairs to him.

369
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,745
Maybe I should give it to him myself.

370
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,122
Well, deliveries are
supposed to be left on my desk.

371
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,207
Yeah, but he has to get
these flowers, it's imperative.

372
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,584
I'm gonna go up myself, all right?

373
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:52,545
- You're not really supposed to go up.
- Floral delivery is my life.

374
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,422
I have to take it up. Thank you.

375
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,841
- Who let you in here?
- I let myself in.

376
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,301
How you doin'?

377
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,512
I have to ask you some questions
about Michael Tandino.

378
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,058
Speak to you later, darling.

379
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:12,273
And what, may I ask,
is your interest in Mr. Tandino?

380
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:13,816
He was my best friend.

381
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:16,110
He came to see me in Detroit
a couple of days ago.

382
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,696
And a couple of hours after he
got there, someone killed him.

383
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:22,116
Oh, my God! That's terrible!

384
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,202
It's fucked up.

385
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:29,123
And? What do you wish to know?

386
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,709
He worked for you, didn't he?

387
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:35,380
Yes, yes, he did. Good gracious.

388
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,591
I'm really sorry to hear this.

389
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,886
Would you like to sit down?
Can I get you anything?

390
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:43,971
No, I'm all right.

391
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,849
Well, how on earth did this happen?

392
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:50,561
Detroit is a very violent city,
isn't it?

393
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:54,732
Yeah, it is.

394
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,695
Well, I do hope the police
have procured some intelligent leads.

395
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,325
Exactly what was it
Mikey did for you here?

396
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,830
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

397
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,665
My name is Foley.

398
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:14,669
Well, excuse me, Mr. Foley,
if I appear a little rude,

399
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:19,507
but this sounds like something
for the authorities in Detroit.

400
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:23,302
So, if you'll forgive me,
I really must get back to work.

401
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,887
Look, all I want to know is what kind...

402
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,849
Gentlemen, would you please
show Mr. Foley to the door?

403
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,350
- Get the fuck off me.
- Hey, take it easy.

404
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:32,186
Yo, man, get the fuck off me.
Get off me, man! Get off me!

405
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:35,189
Get the fuck off me! Get off!

406
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,193
Get the fuck off me, man.
Get off me!

407
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,530
Get the fuck off me!

408
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,158
You think I'm playin' games, man? Hey!

409
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,492
I'm fuckin' somebody up.

410
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,749
Hey!

411
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:57,462
What the fuck is this shit?

412
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,719
Did you see that shit?
I can describe all of them.

413
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,388
Please move to the side of the car
and put your hands on the hood.

414
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:08,681
Why, what's with you guys?

415
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:11,267
You heard what he said, sir.
Do it right now, please.

416
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,812
What kind of shit is this, man?
Hold up, wait a second.

417
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,399
You guys are arrestin' me for gettin'
thrown out of a fuckin' window?!

418
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,943
I got thrown out of a window, man!

419
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,321
Gun, partner!

420
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:27,033
Sir, you are under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

421
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:29,994
Anything you say can, and will be
used against you in a court of law.

422
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,413
You have the right to have an attorney
present during questioning.

423
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,874
Yeah, I understand.
I understand the rights.

424
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:37,710
I know this is bullshit though.
I got thrown out of a fuckin' window!

425
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,505
- Please get in the car, sir.
- Tell me somethin', what's the charge?

426
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,424
Possession of a concealed weapon,
disturbing the peace.

427
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,260
Disturbing the peace?
I got thrown out of a window!

428
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,930
What's the fuckin' charge for gettin'
pushed out of a movin' car, huh?

429
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,265
Jaywalking? This is bullshit!

430
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:00,900
You know, this is the cleanest
and nicest police car

431
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:03,194
I've ever been in in my life.

432
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,946
This thing's nicer than my apartment.

433
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:12,620
Officers, if we see any like...
movie stars, could y'all stop

434
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:15,122
and point them out,
I never seen no shit like that.

435
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,959
- That's enough talkin', pal.
- OK, that's cool.

436
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,469
This is nice.

437
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,392
Well, it's about time.

438
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,727
Thought you forgot I was down here.
I was gettin' hungry.

439
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,854
I never been in no cell
that had a phone in it.

440
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,649
Can I stay for awhile,
'cause I ordered some pizza?

441
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,071
Somebody'd eat it.

442
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,011
Have a seat right over there, please.

443
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,521
I'm Sergeant Taggart and this is
my partner, Detective Rosewood.

444
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:24,191
You always treat visitors
from out of town like this?

445
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:30,865
Why didn't you identify yourself as a
police officer when you were arrested?

446
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:34,118
'Cause I was mindin' my own business.
Where the fuck do you guys get off

447
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,203
arrestin' somebody for gettin'
thrown out of a window?

448
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,623
We have six witnesses
that say you broke in

449
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,459
and started tearin' up the place,
then jumped out the window!

450
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:45,296
And you guys believed that? What
the fuck are you, cops or doormen?

451
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,924
We're more likely to believe an
important local businessman,

452
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,093
than a foul-mouthed jerk
from outta town!

453
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:53,596
Foul-mouthed? Fuck you, man.

454
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,558
- Hey, Sarg.
- You watch your mouth.

455
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,727
Don't square off on me
with some bullshit.

456
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,604
- You want to start some static?
- Don't push me!

457
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,731
Fuck you, man.

458
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,024
Taggart!

459
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,069
Yes, sir?

460
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,237
Come here.

461
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,005
Sir...

462
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,092
I apologize for striking you.

463
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,303
I have no excuse.

464
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,100
Forget about it.

465
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:44,105
Detective Foley, I'm Lieutenant Bogomil,
of the Beverly Hills Police Department.

466
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,273
Do you wish to file charges
against Sergeant Taggart?

467
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,403
This is some kind of joke, right?

468
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:54,699
Do you wish to file charges
against this officer for assault?

469
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:58,494
Look, where I'm from, cops don't
file charges against other cops.

470
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:02,123
No, I don't wanna do that.

471
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,875
Well, in Beverly Hills,
we go strictly by the book.

472
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,171
Now, why didn't you inform us
when you came to town?

473
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,924
- I'm on vacation.
- Well, if you're on vacation,

474
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:14,552
what business did you have
in Victor Maitland's office?

475
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,845
I had to go to the bathroom.

476
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,264
I was walkin' by, it looked like
a nice clean place, so I stopped.

477
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,810
You always take your gun on vacation?

478
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,604
I don't know,
I never been on vacation before.

479
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,816
But in Detroit, cops are required
to carry a firearm at all times.

480
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,444
Well, if you wanna carry a gun,
I suggest you go back there.

481
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,196
I really can't wait to get back there,
if you wanna know the truth.

482
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:35,489
Is that so?

483
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,992
I just got off the phone
with an Inspector Todd in Detroit.

484
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,119
Does that name ring a bell?

485
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:43,831
He's my boss.

486
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,917
He tells me you might not
be very welcome back there.

487
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,672
He says that you're
an outstanding young detective.

488
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,341
I find that very difficult to believe.

489
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,718
But it's true, though.

490
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:58,512
He also says they nearly had
to fire you for insubordination.

491
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,390
I find that very easy to believe.

492
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,185
Now, what are you doing
in Beverly Hills?

493
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,687
I told you, I'm on vacation.
I went to the bathroom,

494
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,190
the next thing I knew six guys
threw me out a window.

495
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,526
Inspector Todd gave me
a message for you, wanna hear it?

496
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,612
I don't think so.

497
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,406
He says if you're out here
investigating the Tandino murder,

498
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,867
you needn't bother coming back.

499
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,953
He tells me that if we inform him
you are working on this case,

500
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,956
he'll have you brought up
on charges and fired.

501
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,251
Now, one last time,
what are you doing...

502
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:32,963
- I'm on vacation!
- Vacation! Vacation.

503
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:38,719
Rosewood, take Mr. Foley over to the
courthouse and let him arrange for bail.

504
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,263
Would you follow me, sir?

505
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:46,018
You know, I gotta hand it to you guys,
if anything you are extremely polite.

506
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,897
Pretty good punch
you got there, Taggart.

507
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:58,739
After you.

508
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,117
You guys are so sweet, you know that?

509
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,204
Thanks for bailin' me out, Jen.

510
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:08,415
If I'd known why you'd been arrested,
I wouldn't have come.

511
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,751
Oh, you don't mean that.

512
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:13,212
No, I don't mean that.

513
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:17,049
Axel, if it wasn't for Victor Maitland,
I'd be waiting on tables!

514
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,260
It just so happens
that the day Mikey got killed,

515
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,388
he showed up at my apartment
with a bag of German bearer bonds.

516
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:24,723
I think he stole 'em
from whoever had him killed.

517
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,141
When I mentioned Mikey's name,

518
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,935
Maitland went nuts
and had me thrown out.

519
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,645
Axel, you look like a hoodlum.

520
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:32,481
You go barging into his office
without an appointment.

521
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:33,774
You're carrying a gun.

522
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:37,111
If you barged into my office and
I didn't know you, I'd throw you out.

523
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:38,612
Is this your car?

524
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,949
Oh, no, in Beverly Hills we just
take whichever car's closest.

525
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:46,287
I remember you used to drive
that crappy, blue Chevy Nova.

526
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,123
What are you driving now?

527
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:54,461
The same crappy, blue Chevy Nova. You
think it's too late for me to study art?

528
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,880
Yeah, I do.

529
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:59,842
Axel, why were you bothering Victor?

530
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,303
You don't think he has anything to do
with Mikey getting killed?

531
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:06,849
Oh, no. No, I was just pokin' around,
I don't think he did nothin'.

532
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:10,436
Axel, Victor Maitland
is one of the top art dealers

533
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:13,397
in the United States.
He has been for ten years.

534
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,107
I'm impressed.

535
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,991
- What are you looking back there for?
- The cops, they're following us.

536
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,702
What? Where?

537
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:30,998
In the back on the right.
The beige Ford.

538
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,028
Can you believe this place?

539
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,448
Axel, how can you afford this?

540
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,700
They're only charging me
the single room rate.

541
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,035
How can you afford that?

542
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:11,163
Actually I can't afford it. But you know
what they got inside that bathroom?

543
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:14,249
They got little robes,
with little initials of the hotel on it.

544
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,543
I love this place,
I can't leave this shit.

545
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,045
I'm gonna steal one of them robes.

546
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,421
- You want one?
- No, thanks.

547
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:20,756
- You want slippers?
- No.

548
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,384
I'm gonna steal them, too.
You should take some of this shit.

549
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,177
Excuse me two seconds.

550
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,723
Hello, room service?

551
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:33,894
Yes, this is Mr. Axel Foley
in suite 1035. Yeah.

552
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:36,397
I'd like to order something
from your late supper menu.

553
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,775
But listen, I want you to deliver it to
this beige Ford parked out on Wilshire.

554
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:44,029
Send down one
bay shrimp salad sandwich, OK?

555
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,867
Right, and is the cold poached
salmon in dill sauce tasty?

556
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,995
OK, send one of those down, all right?

557
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,580
And send down something for dessert.
Thank you very much.

558
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,249
All right, thank you.

559
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:58,043
You're quite a sport.

560
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,878
How long are you gonna stay?

561
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,465
I'm gonna be in town
until I find out who killed Mikey.

562
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:08,887
And I'm very seriously considering
going down to that warehouse

563
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,931
where he worked
and checkin' that place out.

564
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,435
Oh, really?
And how are you planning on getting in?

565
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,999
- Good evening, sir.
- What the hell is that?

566
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,626
It's late supper, sir,
compliments of Axel Foley.

567
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,297
Foley? How did he know we were here?

568
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:44,965
'Cause I let you drive.

569
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,925
I need a couple bananas,
how much are they?

570
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,303
Well, the buffet plate is $12.50.

571
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:52,806
You get peaches, plums,
oranges and bananas.

572
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,767
All I need is a couple of bananas.

573
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:02,441
Go ahead, take those bananas.

574
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:04,359
Thanks.

575
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,072
Forget it, I'm not eatin' that.
Take it back.

576
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,574
- Certainly, sir.
- This really looks great.

577
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,423
Can I get some extra mayo?

578
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,925
- Certainly, sir.
- Thank you.

579
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,803
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

580
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,681
There's the Mercedes.
Will you get rid of that stuff?

581
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,990
What the hell are you doing?

582
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,379
This the place?

583
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:08,590
Yeah, but I'm still not sure
I should do this.

584
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,050
OK, you don't have to do anything.

585
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,052
But when you hear glass
and shit breaking,

586
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,639
don't get scared, it's just me
kickin' in the window. Sit tight.

587
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,351
All right, come on, Axel.

588
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,792
What's happenin', baby?

589
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,711
Axel, grow up.

590
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,311
- You find something?
- Coffee grounds.

591
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:04,605
So?

592
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:07,649
You know what this stuff is used for?

593
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,444
Yes, some people filter hot water
through it and drink it.

594
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,279
Yeah, I'm gonna take this home and
filter hot water through it

595
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,781
and drink it in the mornin'.

596
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,380
What are we hiding for?

597
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,592
I tell you, I wish you'd been
with me last night.

598
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:35,886
What happened?

599
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,889
I stopped at a joint on the way home
to have a couple of drinks.

600
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,934
- Yeah. Which one?
- One of the local joints.

601
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:45,646
This guy comes in, he sits down
a couple of stools away.

602
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:49,775
He's got one of them eyes
that's goin' like this.

603
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:53,111
I didn't know if he was tryin' to
put the make on me, or what.

604
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,030
So I thought I'd take you
over there tonight.

605
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:58,200
Let him have a little shot at you
before I tore his head off.

606
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,088
Come on, let's go,
I wanna get outta here.

607
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,674
Why don't you get off my back.

608
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:14,925
Come on.

609
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,389
I got it.

610
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,866
- Axel, what the hell's going on?
- I'll tell you later, come on.

611
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,120
- Hurry up.
- "Hurry up."

612
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:46,081
- Gimme the key, I'm gonna follow 'em.
- You ever driven a Mercedes before?

613
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,542
No, but a car is a car.
I drive my car everyday.

614
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,502
I'm driving, I've seen your car.

615
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,838
Oh, shit, that's cold.

616
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,888
A banana in your tailpipe!

617
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,891
How could you not notice a man
sticking a banana in your tailpipe?

618
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,102
- He distracted us, sir.
- And how'd he do that?

619
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,897
He sent us a late supper, sir.
See, this waiter comes over...

620
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,066
Billy, he gets the point.

621
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,110
A late supper.

622
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,696
And what did you have, Rosewood?

623
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:23,577
I think it was a shrimp
salad sandwich, sir.

624
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:26,747
- A shrimp salad sandwich.
- Yes, sir.

625
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:33,462
I want you two to go back to the hotel
and wait for Foley to show up.

626
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:37,924
And if you lose him again,
don't bother calling in. You got that?

627
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,427
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

628
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,597
"A late supper."

629
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,517
We've got something for you, Billy.

630
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:51,271
An anti-banana disguise.

631
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,568
It may come in handy.

632
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,945
A little extra protection, Billy.

633
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,074
Very funny.

634
00:45:05,078 --> 00:45:06,745
Come on, Billy, let's go.

635
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,303
Why don't you take the car
and go on home?

636
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:27,474
- Well, what about you?
- I wanna find out what this place is.

637
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:30,268
Oh, I can tell you that.
It's a bonded warehouse.

638
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,480
They hold our foreign shipments here
until they clear Customs.

639
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:36,233
Well, I'm gonna go check it out.
Just take the car and go home, OK?

640
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:40,320
Damn it, Axel!
I'm not gonna bail you out again.

641
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:41,655
Go home.

642
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:41,882
How you doin'? Could you come here
for a second, please?

643
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:46,303
- Hi, do you have a match?
- There's no smoking in here.

644
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:48,388
I'm not gonna smoke now,
I'm gonna smoke when I go outside.

645
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,223
Thank you very much. Thank you.

646
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:52,809
- Is your supervisor here?
- Yeah, he's in the office.

647
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,853
- Can you get him for me?
- What's the problem?

648
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:56,062
- You security here?
- Yeah.

649
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,608
Then you're the fuckin' problem,
go get your supervisor, please. Now!

650
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,527
- Now!
- OK.

651
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:11,369
He didn't come back yet.

652
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,500
Well, what do we do now?

653
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,919
We wait.

654
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:23,548
OK.

655
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:26,301
- Can I help you?
- Are you the supervisor here?

656
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:27,427
Yes, who are you?

657
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:29,930
I'm Inspector Rafferty,
United States Customs Service.

658
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,265
Has all this stuff
passed through Customs already?

659
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,600
No, this is the bonded area.

660
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,519
Then tell me something.
Answer a question.

661
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,772
How can a black man, dressed like me,
just march into your warehouse,

662
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,607
walk into the bonded area
and start poking around

663
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,109
without anyone askin' me
any questions whatsoever?

664
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:45,529
Well, I don't know.

665
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,405
Thank you, that's the answer
I was lookin' for.

666
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:50,450
Just give me your ID numbers,
'cause somebody's gonna lose their job.

667
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,702
This guy gave me a match,
for Christ's sake.

668
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,120
You gave him a match?

669
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:57,958
Listen to me. I do security checks
all over the nation,

670
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,834
and with the exception of Cleveland,

671
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:03,296
this place has the worst security
in the nation!

672
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:06,216
I suggest you call your wives,
'cause we're gonna be here all night.

673
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:09,844
We're gonna check the background
of each and every crate in this section,

674
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,805
starting with this one, right here!

675
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:14,307
Wow.

676
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:18,979
You know, it says here that by the
time the average American is 50,

677
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:23,108
he's got five pounds
of undigested red meat in his bowels.

678
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:26,611
Why are you telling me this?

679
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:29,614
What makes you think
I have any interest in that at all?

680
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,244
Well, you eat a lot of red meat.

681
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,247
Now, the inspector needs
all the information

682
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:39,833
- on those airway bill numbers.
- All the manifests, too.

683
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:42,043
That's right, and he needs
the records of all shipments

684
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,670
- due into the same destination.
- Right.

685
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:45,964
- What's this all about?
- Just do it!

686
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:48,133
You got some kind of warrant for this?

687
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:52,721
You know, you have a very big mouth.
Are you hiding something from me?

688
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:57,225
I bet that's your Porsche that's parked
outside. Isn't that your Porsche?

689
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,311
How would you like for me
to have the IRS come down here

690
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,771
and crawl up your fuckin' ass with a
microscope? 'Cause they'll do it!

691
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,857
I've seen 'em do it!
It's not a pretty sight!

692
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:06,568
I want you to know somethin', pal.
I want all y'all to know somethin'.

693
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:09,529
I can have 25 agents down here
in 15 minutes,

694
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:12,240
to march in here,
snatch up bonds from underneath you

695
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:14,284
and you guys'll be
out of business permanently

696
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:16,453
if I don't get some cooperation!
Is that understood?

697
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:19,706
Don't get upset, we'll give
you everything you need. Right, guys?

698
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:22,083
- Everything you need.
- That's not my Porsche.

699
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:24,628
- I don't know whose it is.
- You ain't got nothin' to worry about.

700
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,255
I don't know what you all think I am,
take me for some kind of fool.

701
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:28,423
Hurry up! Quicker!

702
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:37,057
You know, I noticed you've been
drinking a lot of coffee lately.

703
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:42,604
Well, I think that's why you
have a hard time relaxing.

704
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,125
Jesus Christ!

705
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,504
You almost gave me a heart attack.

706
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:09,214
What are you guys doin' here so late?

707
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:11,591
You're a cocky son of a bitch,
aren't you?

708
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:14,844
Look, if you're still mad about
the banana thing, I'm sorry.

709
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,763
- Just needed a little time to myself.
- Yeah.

710
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:20,725
Just wish I would've saw the expression
on your face when the car konked out.

711
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:23,687
Yeah, very funny.
Lieutenant docked us two days' pay.

712
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,022
Get outta here!

713
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:31,319
- He's not kidding.
- No, he's not kidding.

714
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:35,782
By the way, thanks for the sandwich.

715
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,451
He meant it as a joke, Billy,
like the bananas.

716
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:39,577
Hey, wait a minute.

717
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,455
I'm a fellow police officer, I know
what it's like to be on a stakeout.

718
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:44,791
When I sent that food down,
that was from the heart.

719
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:46,042
Bullshit!

720
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:49,087
Why are we always arguing, man?

721
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:51,423
All three of us are cops,
we should be workin' together.

722
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,758
We all had a very rough day today.

723
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,594
What do you say,
we all go get something to drink

724
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,596
and make up and be friends, huh?

725
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:00,807
Forget it.

726
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:04,561
OK, fuck it. I'm gonna
get somethin' to drink, all right?

727
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:06,896
You guys can try to follow me
if you want to do that,

728
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,816
but I lost y'all once today,
which means I can do this shit again.

729
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,901
Why don't we just go get
somethin' to drink together?

730
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:15,071
- Let's be friends.
- We don't drink on duty.

731
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:18,283
OK, fine, all right, but listen to me.

732
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:20,827
I found the perfect place.

733
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,079
I saw it on the way over here.
It's perfect for you guys.

734
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:25,749
You can go, it's very conservative,
and you guys'll love it.

735
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,501
Don't worry, it's nice. Trust me.

736
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,486
Hi, can I get you something?

737
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:57,697
Yes! I'm havin' a great time.
Can I have a Scotch and soda?

738
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:01,034
And the brothers... What y'all want,
like, light beers for the fellas.

739
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:02,535
Two club sodas.

740
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:07,123
You guys crack me up,
with this "on duty" shit.

741
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,917
Billy! Billy.

742
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,711
You don't have to be embarrassed
if your dick gets hard.

743
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:16,049
It's a dick, it's supposed to get hard.
That's the whole object of this.

744
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:19,135
Taggart's dick gets hard, but he won't
let you know, 'cause he's the boss.

745
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,221
Boss's dick got to stay limp, right?

746
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:23,765
I ain't on duty, so my dick can be hard.

747
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,519
Hey, Taggart, look.

748
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,730
Check that out, I found that
at Maitland's warehouse.

749
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:33,066
Billy! Bill, here, give her this.

750
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:36,402
Really, stuff that inside her
little thing and she'll go nuts.

751
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,821
Excuse me.

752
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:41,366
Billy!

753
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:46,079
- What do you think?
- Coffee grounds.

754
00:52:46,247 --> 00:52:47,747
- Yeah!
- So?

755
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:50,416
You guys don't know nothin'
about nothin', do you?

756
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,752
Just got your badges and your guns
and you're on the job, right?

757
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,589
Make sure we get the right drinks.
If I drink club soda, I'll throw up.

758
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:59,384
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.

759
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:25,618
- I think she likes you.
- Think so?

760
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,287
There's no doubt in my mind.

761
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:32,500
Taggart, see that guy
over there in the black coat?

762
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:35,503
Black jacket?

763
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:38,256
- Yeah?
- Well, it's June.

764
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:41,259
Don't you think it's kind of hot
for a long, black leather coat?

765
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:42,635
Yeah, a little bit.

766
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:46,264
Yeah. Look at his partner over there.
They just came in together.

767
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:51,561
Somethin's gettin' ready to go down.

768
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:54,314
Why don't you go over there
and cover that guy for me, all right?

769
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,523
What's going on?

770
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:57,859
I'm gonna go check out
this asshole at the bar.

771
00:53:58,027 --> 00:54:00,486
Billy over here
is gonna make sure that I behave.

772
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,156
Will somebody tell me what's going on?

773
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,579
No bullshit this time.

774
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,459
Just sit tight, Billy.

775
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:43,196
Philip!

776
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:46,783
Hey, man, what's happenin', Phil?

777
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:49,744
I knew that was you!
He told me it wasn't.

778
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:52,038
Said you don't come here no more,
but I said, "It's Phil!"

779
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:55,291
- Get outta here, man.
- I told you it's Philip, you liar!

780
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:56,876
Hey, Philip, gimme kiss, baby!

781
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:58,962
- I said get the hell out of here!
- Hey!

782
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:02,173
Everybody, freeze!

783
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,885
Turn around. Turn around!

784
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,929
- Phil!
- Get your hands on the table!

785
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:11,891
Phil! What's wrong, man?
What's all the hostility?

786
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:14,435
- Get back, man.
- What you doin' with all this gun, man?

787
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:16,396
- I told you to get back.
- You changed, man!

788
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,607
If you don't get back,
I'm gonna blow your fuckin' brains out!

789
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,070
Police, move and I'll kill you.

790
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:29,033
Don't move! Turn over!

791
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:32,996
Way to go, Rosewood.
You're some kind of cop, you know that?

792
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:36,290
Sorry for the disturbance, folks.
Everything's under control.

793
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,594
Taggart!

794
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,598
Would you mind explaining to me
what you and Rosewood

795
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,601
were doing in a strip bar
out of our jurisdiction,

796
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,228
when you were still on duty?

797
00:55:57,396 --> 00:55:59,439
Sir, before you chastise
these two officers,

798
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,232
I think there's something
you should know.

799
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,110
The only reason that they
were at a strip bar

800
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,738
was because they were tailing me
and I went to this place.

801
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,782
Now, these two officers were sitting
outside wondering what I was doing.

802
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,702
I was in havin' a good time,
I'm into things like that.

803
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:15,496
Anyway, these guys waited outside,

804
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,457
and the only reason
that they came in

805
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,792
was because they saw
two suspicious-looking gentlemen,

806
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,462
with bulges in their jackets,
going into the place.

807
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,882
Well, it turns out that these guys were
gonna commit a robbery, sir.

808
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,593
These men watched them,
waited for them to make their move

809
00:56:28,761 --> 00:56:30,428
and then they foiled the crime.

810
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:33,890
I did not know what was goin' on.
I was watchin' the show, havin' fun.

811
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:36,559
I'm still freaked out by it.
They must have a sixth sense or...

812
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:41,439
I don't know what you teach these
fellows, but they're not regular cops.

813
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:42,690
They're super cops.

814
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:45,777
And the only thing missing
on these guys are capes.

815
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:51,657
Is this what really happened?

816
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:55,661
No, sir.

817
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,998
Would someone like to tell me
what really happened?

818
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,418
Well...

819
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:07,006
Foley invited us to this bar...
and we accepted.

820
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:09,342
We ordered club soda, sir.

821
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:13,137
Right. And while we were there...

822
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:18,101
...Foley observed the two suspects
casing the establishment.

823
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,770
And before we knew
what was going on...

824
00:57:21,814 --> 00:57:23,981
...he'd already disarmed one of them.

825
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:30,071
Detective Foley deserves
all the credit for the arrest, sir.

826
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:34,200
Detective Foley,
we appreciate your assistance.

827
00:57:34,827 --> 00:57:37,453
But in the future, if you want
to practice law enforcement,

828
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:40,206
I would prefer you did it in Detroit.

829
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,167
I understand, sir. I'm sorry.

830
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:46,379
But before I go I just want you
two to know something, all right?

831
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:49,590
The super cop story was working.

832
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:54,011
OK? It was working
and you guys messed it up.

833
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:58,724
OK? I'm tryin' to figure
you guys out, but I haven't yet.

834
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,226
But it's cool.

835
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:03,146
You fuck up a perfectly
good lie and it's all right.

836
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:12,655
You guys are off the case.

837
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:16,826
Foster. McCabe. Your turn.

838
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:19,245
Don't lose him.

839
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,956
Not a chance, sir.

840
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:27,420
And you two... in my office.

841
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:48,608
Morning, gentlemen.
Some coffee and donuts?

842
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:51,694
- What?
- Coffee and donuts.

843
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:59,118
There he is.

844
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,971
Morning, officers.
What you all, the second team?

845
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:21,557
We're the first team.

846
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:24,810
Yeah. We're not gonna fall
for a banana in the tailpipe.

847
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,855
"You're not going to fall
for the banana in the tailpipe?"

848
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:30,566
It should be more natural, brother,
it should flow out, like this:

849
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:33,486
"Look man, I ain't fallin'
for no banana in my tailpipe!"

850
00:59:33,654 --> 00:59:35,238
See, that's more natural for us.

851
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,989
You been hangin' out
with this dude too long.

852
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:43,913
I'm sorry, I'm just fuckin' with you.
That's funny to me. Sorry.

853
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:46,123
So, y'all gonna try and keep up with me?

854
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:49,669
- No problem.
- Isn't this Victor Maitland's house?

855
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,504
Yeah, I think so.

856
00:59:54,675 --> 00:59:56,175
Well, I seen enough.

857
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,010
Y'all want somethin' to drink?
A beer or somethin'?

858
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:00,680
I got some stuff in the trunk.
Excuse me.

859
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:15,319
For a man who claims to be on vacation,

860
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,029
you look a lot like
you're on a stakeout.

861
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:21,575
Stakeout? No, no, I'm picnicking.
This is like a picnic area.

862
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,044
Well, guys, I been
shootin' the shit long enough.

863
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:34,880
Time for me to take in some sights.
Excuse me.

864
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,226
What the hell's he doing?

865
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:29,912
Can you put this in a good spot?

866
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,165
All this shit happened the last time
I parked here. Thank you.

867
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:02,486
May I help you?

868
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:06,407
Yes, I'm looking for Victor Maitland.

869
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,202
You realize that this is
a members-only club?

870
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:13,038
But I have to talk to Victor,
it's very, very important.

871
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:15,332
Are you sure it's
Victor Maitland you want?

872
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:20,087
Oh, yes, the grey haired gentleman,
very dark skin, Capricorn. Victor.

873
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:24,508
Well, why don't you give me
the message and I'll take it to him.

874
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:26,385
OK, I guess I can do that.

875
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:29,680
Tell Victor that Ramon,
the fella he met about a week ago,

876
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:32,475
tell him that Ramon
went to the clinic today

877
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,561
and I found out that I have...

878
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,063
...Herpes symplex ten.

879
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:41,650
And I think Victor should go check
himself out with his physician

880
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,862
to make sure everything is fine, before
things start fallin' off on the man.

881
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:49,742
Perhaps you better tell him that.

882
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,330
You know, I think that would be best.

883
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:56,081
So do I.

884
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:12,598
Hi, Victor.

885
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,269
I'm back.

886
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:25,945
Look, cuz, don't even try it, OK?

887
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,782
Why don't you get the hell
outta here, cuz.

888
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:31,992
Get the fuck away from me.

889
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:49,885
That's very good, Victor.

890
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:52,972
Could you teach him to roll over
and sit and do all that shit, too?

891
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,559
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to you.

892
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,644
Last time we met,
I didn't get a chance to talk to you.

893
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:02,982
- I have nothing to say to you.
- That's cool, I'll do all the talking.

894
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:07,611
This is a very nice place, Vic.

895
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:10,614
Hi. I like this, this is nice.

896
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,784
Glad you like it.
I must make you a member.

897
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:21,125
You know, Victor, I know that you're
into a lot of crooked shit.

898
01:05:21,293 --> 01:05:24,545
And I have a pretty good idea
that you had Mikey killed.

899
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,131
And when I find out for sure...

900
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:30,342
...I'm gonna fuck you up real bad.

901
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:31,510
Is that so?

902
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:35,889
Now, listen to me,
my tough little friend.

903
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:38,892
I don't know from under
what stone you crawled,

904
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:43,397
or where you get these
ridiculous ideas about me,

905
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:45,983
but it seems painfully obvious

906
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:49,987
you haven't the slightest fucking
idea who you're dealing with.

907
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:54,366
Now, my advice to you is...

908
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:57,369
...crawl back to your
little stone in Detroit,

909
01:05:57,537 --> 01:06:01,373
before you get squashed, OK?

910
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,500
Please step away from the table, sir.

911
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:05,210
Gotta go now, Vic.

912
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,755
- Nice meeting you again.
- Yeah.

913
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,513
Catch you later, Vic.

914
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,766
I can't wait.

915
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:35,115
Don't I know you guys from some place?
You look so familiar.

916
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:41,080
Detective Foley,
this is becoming very irritating.

917
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,332
Why are you bothering Victor Maitland?

918
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:50,422
I had a friend named Michael Tandino
that used to work for Victor Maitland.

919
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:53,592
And Maitland had him killed.
I can't prove that right now,

920
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,844
but when I do,
you'll be the first to know.

921
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,891
Forget what you can prove.
Talk to me.

922
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:06,438
OK, listen, everybody knows
that Victor Maitland

923
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:08,107
is a hot-shot art dealer, OK?

924
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:11,402
But I did some pokin' around and
art's not the only thing that he deals.

925
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:14,405
I went to his warehouse
and I saw some guys unloading a crate

926
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:16,740
that was filled
with German bearer bonds.

927
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:20,160
Now, my friend Michael Tandino
had bonds like this on him,

928
01:07:20,328 --> 01:07:22,788
coincidentally,
when he was killed in Detroit.

929
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:23,956
Just because Maitland chooses

930
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:26,125
to invest in the same kind of bonds
your friend had,

931
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:27,876
doesn't necessarily mean he's a killer.

932
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,838
The man's not an investor,
he's a smuggler, OK?

933
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:33,549
Be it bonds or drugs or whatever.

934
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:36,301
The crate that I saw
didn't even pass through Customs.

935
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:38,137
Maitland is paying someone so his guys

936
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,973
can get the shipments out of Customs
before they get inspected.

937
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:42,975
Maitland's guys get their hands on it,

938
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:45,310
they take the drugs
or the bonds out of the crates

939
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:48,564
and they send it back before
Customs even knows what's going on.

940
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:52,901
And you witnessed all this?

941
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:55,362
Everything except for the drugs,

942
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:57,865
but I found coffee grounds
all over the warehouse.

943
01:07:58,867 --> 01:07:59,992
Coffee grounds?

944
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,119
You said something about that before.
What does that mean?

945
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:04,580
Drugs are sometimes
packed in coffee grounds.

946
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:05,998
The scent throws off the dogs.

947
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:08,333
Very good, lieutenant.
Now what do we do?

948
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:12,504
Look, Detective Foley, I...

949
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,674
I'm sorry.

950
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:17,342
I'd really like to help you.

951
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,679
If you'd found the drugs,
that's one thing,

952
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:23,182
but if your only evidence
is coffee grounds,

953
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,975
we don't have enough
to get a search warrant.

954
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:26,852
Come on, guys,
I know how we can get around...

955
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,646
We don't get around search warrants
in Beverly Hills.

956
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:33,484
- Taggart.
- Yes, sir.

957
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:35,277
I want you to start checking this out.

958
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:39,031
Start with the LAPD, the FBI,
and the Customs Service.

959
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:40,574
Hey, wait a minute, Taggart.

960
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:43,076
Look, lieutenant,
Maitland is much smarter than that.

961
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:44,870
We go and start
snoopin' around his place,

962
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:47,122
he's gonna close down and get
his shipments from someplace else.

963
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,541
- It'd be a big waste of time.
- Oh, really?

964
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:52,377
Is that what your extensive experience
leads you to believe?

965
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:54,755
- Look, I haven't been on your force...
- Sir!

966
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,217
Oh, shit.

967
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:02,429
- Is this the man?
- Yes, sir.

968
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:06,099
Is this the gentleman who crashed
through Victor Maitland's window?

969
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:11,104
Who disabled an unmarked unit
with a banana?

970
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:12,481
Yes, sir.

971
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:15,984
Who lured Taggart and Rosemont

972
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:19,571
into a gross dereliction of duty

973
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:22,533
at a striptease establishment?

974
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,243
It's Rosewood, sir.

975
01:09:25,245 --> 01:09:26,495
Yes, sir.

976
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:32,042
Is this the gentleman who ruined the
buffet at the Harrow Club this morning?

977
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:34,753
Yes, sir.

978
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:39,716
I just bet you are the pride
of your department in Detroit.

979
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:46,932
Lieutenant, I'd like to see you
in your office.

980
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:49,268
Yes, sir.

981
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:54,940
Is this the man who...

982
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:58,235
...wrecked the buffet
at the Harrow Club this morning?

983
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:00,237
Lower your voice, for Christ's sake.

984
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:02,573
Why, can the guy hear me
through the wall?

985
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,032
Yes, he can.

986
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:25,929
Rosewood, take Detective Foley
back to his hotel room,

987
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:29,808
watch him pack,
and escort him to the city limits.

988
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:33,520
When you get there,
you can give him his gun back.

989
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:39,318
The two charges of disturbing the peace
have been dropped against you.

990
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:42,321
But the chief says if you return
to the city of Beverly Hills,

991
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,865
the charges will be reinstated

992
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:47,534
and you will be prosecuted
to the limit of the law.

993
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,661
Sir, may I say something?

994
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:51,079
- Billy...
- What?

995
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,165
Well, he seems to have enough
to follow up...

996
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:55,000
You wanna tell that to the chief?

997
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:59,379
- No, sir.
- Then I suggest you get moving.

998
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:02,674
Come on, Axel.

999
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:25,364
Right. Let me check on that
tomorrow and get right back to you.

1000
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:26,823
Thank you.

1001
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:29,785
- Hi.
- Victor, hi.

1002
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:32,079
Sit down.
Hope I'm not interrupting you.

1003
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:34,539
Of course not, don't be silly.

1004
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,793
Jenny, there's a gentleman
in town from Detroit

1005
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:40,921
who says he's a friend
of Michael Tandino.

1006
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:45,175
He came by the office yesterday
and asked me all sorts of...

1007
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:47,469
...rather odd questions.
Excuse me, darling.

1008
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:50,889
I believe his name is Foley.

1009
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:54,393
Since you were such a good friend of
Michael, I was wondering if you were...

1010
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,645
...perhaps familiar with the fellow?

1011
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:59,648
Well, we... grew up
in the same neighborhood.

1012
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:01,608
Really? Have you seen him lately?

1013
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:05,988
He... he came in yesterday.

1014
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:08,240
What, came by here?

1015
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:12,953
And?

1016
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:18,834
He told me that... Mikey'd been killed.

1017
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:22,087
Yes. Yes, I know.

1018
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:27,426
- And then?
- That's it.

1019
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:31,388
He left and...
I haven't seen him since.

1020
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:36,560
You wouldn't, by any chance, know
where Foley's staying would you?

1021
01:12:36,728 --> 01:12:40,313
I have some information
which just might be helpful for him.

1022
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:45,485
No, I have no idea.

1023
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:54,369
Yes.

1024
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,289
Well, I hope I didn't
disturb you too much.

1025
01:12:57,457 --> 01:12:59,541
Oh, no, no problem.

1026
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:02,794
- We'll have dinner soon, yes?
- That would be lovely.

1027
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,129
Take care.

1028
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:18,060
Hey, Billy,
I read the manifest, all right?

1029
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,604
They're expecting
another shipment in today.

1030
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:23,648
- If Bogomil...
- Never mind Bogomil!

1031
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:26,485
This is a chance to blow this case wide
open, the two of us, what do you say?

1032
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:27,986
- Come on.
- Look, Axel...

1033
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:30,322
I wish I could, but I can't!

1034
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:34,076
- Why?
- Because Bogomil would kill me.

1035
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,164
Billy...

1036
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:41,917
I'm not going to drive you
to the art gallery, Axel.

1037
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:44,503
It'll just take a couple of minutes!

1038
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,671
My friend Jenny'll let us
in Maitland's warehouse.

1039
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,965
We can be there when the shipment
comes in and nail 'em!

1040
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:51,134
How can you be sure
if it'll be drugs, or something?

1041
01:13:51,302 --> 01:13:52,594
I got a hunch, OK?

1042
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:56,515
It's a technique by which many crimes
outside of Beverly Hills get solved.

1043
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,018
Why didn't you tell Bogomil
about this shipment?

1044
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:03,271
Bogomil does everything by the book.
You know what I'm startin' to think?

1045
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,565
That everybody
in this goddamn town is a robot.

1046
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:07,901
This thing is very personal to me.

1047
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:13,031
All they asked me to do
was drive you out of town.

1048
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:16,284
Now, I'm gonna screw that up, too.

1049
01:14:18,746 --> 01:14:22,541
- Boy.
- Billy. I love you.

1050
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,251
I just fell in love with you.

1051
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:30,882
Jenny, how you doing?
This is my good buddy, Billy Rosewood.

1052
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,342
- This is Jenny Summers.
- Hi.

1053
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:35,220
- Billy's a Beverly Hills cop.
- How do you do?

1054
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:36,513
That's Serge.

1055
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:40,392
Yo, Serge, will you
get my friend an espresso?

1056
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,894
You want it with a lemon twist?

1057
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:46,690
Yeah, sure, if it's no bother.

1058
01:14:46,858 --> 01:14:49,860
No, don't be stupid.

1059
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:53,530
Axel, Victor Maitland was here
asking questions about you today.

1060
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:56,074
I'm telling you,
he was acting real weird.

1061
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:59,244
The reason I came down is 'cause
I want to get back inside the warehouse.

1062
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:02,497
- How 'bout I go with you?
- Jenny, come on, now.

1063
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:05,750
You work here with Serge,
in a art gallery. You're not a cop.

1064
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:07,878
Axel, if this has anything
to do with Mikey,

1065
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:09,921
then I want to go
check it out for myself.

1066
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:12,174
I don't have time to stand here
and argue with you.

1067
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:15,051
Wait a second. Let me get my keys...

1068
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:16,970
...and we'll argue on the way.

1069
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:23,059
Billy, your job's just to sit
out here and observe things.

1070
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:26,313
- Don't make a move until I get you.
- I don't see why I can't come in.

1071
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,565
You can't go in
'cause you're a cop in this town.

1072
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:31,193
You go in without probable cause,
they're gonna call it an illegal search.

1073
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,778
Didn't they teach you that
in cop school?

1074
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:36,865
Sit tight. If I find some evidence
I'll come out and get you.

1075
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,117
- But you can't just...
- But nothing. Just be cool.

1076
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:42,621
If anything jumps off, I'll come
and I'll get you, all right? OK?

1077
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,372
Thank you.

1078
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:48,460
Any chance you're gonna give me that
key and let me go in there by myself?

1079
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:50,003
No chance.

1080
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:54,424
Fuck. Come on.

1081
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:42,138
Looks like they been here already.

1082
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:45,183
- What exactly are you looking for?
- This.

1083
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:48,561
This is a crate from overseas,
hasn't passed through Customs yet.

1084
01:16:58,364 --> 01:16:59,739
What is that?

1085
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:12,210
Coffee?

1086
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:13,920
Yeah, it's coffee on top.

1087
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:21,678
But this ain't sugar.

1088
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:24,514
- Go get Rosewood.
- Welcome to the party.

1089
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:51,750
Seems we have guests.

1090
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,898
How nice.

1091
01:18:15,066 --> 01:18:17,108
I do like surprises.

1092
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:30,288
Jeannette.

1093
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:39,130
I just can't tell you how disappointed
I am to find you here.

1094
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:41,716
- Victor, listen I...
- Shut up!

1095
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:45,178
I don't want to hear it.

1096
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:06,658
Take her to the car
and wait for me, OK?

1097
01:19:06,826 --> 01:19:08,368
What are you gonna do with him?

1098
01:19:08,536 --> 01:19:13,248
I think you should be more worried
about what we're going to do with you.

1099
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:16,084
Jenny, don't worry about me.
We got cocaine and coffee here.

1100
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:18,169
We're gonna get wired
and have a big party.

1101
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:20,755
Thanks for havin' me over Vic,
this is very nice.

1102
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,883
You say something?

1103
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:40,191
If somethin' happens to her...

1104
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:45,363
I'm all ears.

1105
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:47,949
...I'll kill you.

1106
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:50,827
Really?

1107
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:53,371
That would be a neat trick.

1108
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:06,926
Well, cuz.

1109
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:09,554
Are you still pissed at me?

1110
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:14,559
Oh, no. No.

1111
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:18,188
But I should've taken care of you
in Detroit.

1112
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:26,404
When I popped your little buddy.

1113
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:34,787
Goodbye, Mr. Foley.

1114
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:38,583
Have a nice day.

1115
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:40,710
I'll try.

1116
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:07,320
Damn it.

1117
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:12,116
Oh, boy.

1118
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:28,383
How's that little bump on the head doin'
I gave you in Detroit, huh?

1119
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:30,134
Healed up nice, I hope.

1120
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:57,328
Freeze!

1121
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:12,427
Thanks, man.

1122
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:30,862
Tell Taggart to check out the warehouse
and act on whatever he finds.

1123
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:32,196
I'll explain it to him later.

1124
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:34,490
DD-6, Sergeant Taggart is here now,

1125
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:36,367
- and he wants to talk to you.
- Shit!

1126
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:39,454
Billy, what the hell is goin' on?

1127
01:22:39,622 --> 01:22:41,664
I'm sorry, Sarg, I can't talk now.

1128
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:43,625
What you mean you can't talk now?

1129
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:47,462
Just check out the warehouse and
please don't say anything to Bogomil.

1130
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:50,590
Sorry, sir, he's not
transmitting anymore.

1131
01:22:50,758 --> 01:22:51,924
- Shit!
- What's the matter?

1132
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:55,303
It's Billy, he's doin' somethin'
dumb again, but I don't know what.

1133
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:56,929
Was he calling from the hotel?

1134
01:22:57,097 --> 01:22:58,556
No, sir.

1135
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:02,727
Right now his car is heading north
on Palm Canyon Road.

1136
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:04,604
Hey, we were there this morning.

1137
01:23:04,772 --> 01:23:06,648
- What?
- Yeah.

1138
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:09,025
Foley was up there,
looking over Maitland's house.

1139
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:10,777
Do you have the address
of that warehouse?

1140
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:12,070
Yes, sir.

1141
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:15,573
Here. You two check that place out.

1142
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:18,618
Then find me, and let me know
what the hell is goin' on over there.

1143
01:23:18,786 --> 01:23:20,662
And don't talk to anybody but me!

1144
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:43,976
Hold it right there, Foley,
you're under arrest.

1145
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:45,436
Billy, what the hell are you doin' here?

1146
01:23:45,604 --> 01:23:46,938
I stole my gun and forced him
to bring me here.

1147
01:23:47,106 --> 01:23:50,358
No, he didn't, Sarg. Look, everything
he said about Maitland is right.

1148
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:53,194
Now, he's kidnapped a woman
and he's got her in his house.

1149
01:23:54,321 --> 01:23:55,947
Well, let's go in there and get her.

1150
01:23:56,115 --> 01:23:57,699
What the fuck you think
I'm tryin' to do here?

1151
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:01,202
You're not doin' anything! We'll have
a search warrant in 20 minutes.

1152
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:04,205
- She'll be dead in 20 minutes.
- Stop workin' on that lock.

1153
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:07,917
I'm gonna open this door and I'm goin'
inside. You wanna stop me? Shoot me.

1154
01:24:10,337 --> 01:24:11,921
- Me, too.
- Billy!

1155
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:14,424
You can do what you want,
but I'm going in with Axel.

1156
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:16,926
Goddamn it, Billy,
this is really serious trouble!

1157
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:19,137
If you're lucky, you'll just get fired.

1158
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:23,182
- Got it.
- It's my last warning, Foley.

1159
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:33,276
- Billy!
- I'm sorry, Sarg, I've got to.

1160
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:40,283
Shit. Wait a minute.

1161
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,006
What's that?

1162
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:59,177
Looks like east gate. Punch it up.

1163
01:25:03,307 --> 01:25:05,349
Who the hell is that?

1164
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:07,643
Better get Maitland up here.

1165
01:25:24,495 --> 01:25:27,163
Where is everybody?
Owensby, is Rosewood back yet?

1166
01:25:27,331 --> 01:25:29,165
- No, sir.
- Have you seen Taggart?

1167
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:31,125
He took off about ten minutes ago.

1168
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:43,179
Foley's on the grounds.

1169
01:25:43,347 --> 01:25:45,139
Well, how the hell should I know?

1170
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:47,141
Get some people out there right away.

1171
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:52,146
Don't take your eyes off that screen.

1172
01:26:23,804 --> 01:26:26,138
I want you to try to locate
Taggart and Rosewood.

1173
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:38,442
Come on.

1174
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:54,250
OK, OK, OK.

1175
01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:58,045
Shit.

1176
01:27:02,593 --> 01:27:05,970
- They must be away from the car, sir.
- I can see that, keep trying.

1177
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:09,974
- DD-13, come in please.
- What's their 20?

1178
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:17,940
- 609 Palm Canyon Road.
- Who lives at that address?

1179
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:23,654
A Victor Maitland, sir.

1180
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:26,407
Try again.

1181
01:27:27,326 --> 01:27:28,659
Let's go around.

1182
01:27:29,786 --> 01:27:31,495
We can do it. Come on.

1183
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:37,668
Ready?

1184
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:39,795
One, two...

1185
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:12,620
You all right?

1186
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:18,209
What the fuck am I doin' here?

1187
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:26,217
Drop it!

1188
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,645
- Good shot, Billy.
- Let's go.

1189
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:51,283
- Jesus Christ!
- Yeah, these guys are serious.

1190
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:53,077
I hate machine guns.

1191
01:29:02,629 --> 01:29:04,005
Cover me.

1192
01:29:17,477 --> 01:29:19,770
You guys go around front,
I'm gonna check the back.

1193
01:29:22,733 --> 01:29:25,109
Sir, we have a report of shots fired
at that same location.

1194
01:29:25,277 --> 01:29:27,278
609 Palm Canyon Road.

1195
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:31,240
Put out a 998: Officers need assistance.

1196
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:33,117
- Undercovers on the scene.
- Sir?

1197
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:35,786
Just do it!
I want all north end units to roll.

1198
01:29:35,954 --> 01:29:38,330
South end units stay in their area.

1199
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:40,082
Damn! Let's go.

1200
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:42,084
Undercover officers at location.

1201
01:29:50,844 --> 01:29:52,970
Police! You're all under arrest!

1202
01:29:59,478 --> 01:30:02,229
You do that again,
I'll shoot you myself.

1203
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:16,220
You know what I keep thinking about?

1204
01:31:17,514 --> 01:31:19,223
You know the end of Butch Cassidy?

1205
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:25,563
Where Redford and Newman
are almost out of ammunition.

1206
01:31:27,858 --> 01:31:31,402
And the whole Bolivian Army
is out in front of this little hut.

1207
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:35,239
Billy...

1208
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:38,701
I'm gonna make you pay for this.

1209
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:00,741
- You gonna hang around here?
- Fuck no!

1210
01:33:28,186 --> 01:33:30,312
- Freeze it!
- Hold it right there.

1211
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:35,150
Oh, shit.

1212
01:33:47,872 --> 01:33:49,331
Axel!

1213
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:56,422
Be careful, old boy, you might hit me.

1214
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,056
Freeze!

1215
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:26,952
Police! You're all under arrest!

1216
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,538
Lay down your weapons in front of you

1217
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:33,250
and take two steps back
with your hands up!

1218
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:39,548
Very good.

1219
01:34:40,383 --> 01:34:41,592
Great.

1220
01:35:00,737 --> 01:35:02,237
What the hell's going on here?

1221
01:35:03,073 --> 01:35:04,114
Oh, shit.

1222
01:35:04,282 --> 01:35:06,450
- What's this man doing here?
- Bleeding, sir.

1223
01:35:06,618 --> 01:35:09,870
Rosewood, how come
he isn't wearing cuffs?

1224
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:14,416
Well, he isn't actually in custody, sir.

1225
01:35:14,584 --> 01:35:17,294
Well, place him in custody,
or would you like me to do it?

1226
01:35:17,462 --> 01:35:19,713
Wouldn't you like to hear
my report first, sir?

1227
01:35:22,133 --> 01:35:24,843
You have a report
that explains all this?

1228
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:26,804
Yes, sir.

1229
01:35:28,264 --> 01:35:31,308
Well, I will be very glad to hear it.

1230
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:38,107
Ms. Jeannette Summers, the manager
of Mr. Maitland's art gallery,

1231
01:35:38,274 --> 01:35:40,776
accidentally discovered large quantities
of a substance

1232
01:35:40,944 --> 01:35:43,987
she suspected was cocaine
in the art gallery's warehouse.

1233
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:47,157
She immediately communicated her
discovery to Detective Axel Foley

1234
01:35:47,325 --> 01:35:48,659
of the Detroit Police Force.

1235
01:35:50,537 --> 01:35:53,455
Detective Foley was,
at the time, cooperating

1236
01:35:53,623 --> 01:35:57,334
in a joint Beverly Hills-Detroit
investigation of narcotics trafficking.

1237
01:35:57,502 --> 01:36:01,088
Detectives Foley and Rosewood,
responding to Ms. Summers' report,

1238
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:03,715
proceeded to the warehouse,
where Rosewood did, in fact,

1239
01:36:03,883 --> 01:36:06,427
discover approximately
80 kilos of cocaine.

1240
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:09,680
Rosewood immediately
called for backup.

1241
01:36:09,848 --> 01:36:11,849
And I dispatched our officers
to this location.

1242
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:15,310
Sergeant Taggart here,
was the first to arrive at the scene.

1243
01:36:15,478 --> 01:36:19,022
And having probable cause to
believe a felony was in progress,

1244
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:22,526
Sergeant Taggart joined Rosewood,
with Detective Foley

1245
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:26,447
present only as an observer,
and proceeded to enter the grounds.

1246
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:28,282
And in the course
of defending ourselves,

1247
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:31,535
we shot several suspects,
including Mr. Maitland.

1248
01:36:36,249 --> 01:36:39,001
You expect me to believe that report?

1249
01:36:40,295 --> 01:36:42,129
That's the report I'm filing, sir.

1250
01:36:45,383 --> 01:36:46,884
Sergeant Taggart...

1251
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:49,970
Why don't you tell me what happened?

1252
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:05,777
Happened just like
the lieutenant said, chief.

1253
01:37:18,791 --> 01:37:23,545
Well, I suppose
congratulations are in order.

1254
01:37:25,465 --> 01:37:27,216
Thank you, sir.

1255
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:30,260
That report better be
on my desk in the morning.

1256
01:37:30,428 --> 01:37:32,262
Yes, sir, first thing.

1257
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:43,357
You were lyin' your ass off.

1258
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:49,821
Why don't you go to the hospital
and get your shoulder looked at?

1259
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:52,491
Excuse me, sir.

1260
01:37:57,956 --> 01:38:00,666
I was wondering if you could,
like, do me a favor, sir?

1261
01:38:01,918 --> 01:38:05,379
- I think your favors are all used up.
- I understand.

1262
01:38:05,547 --> 01:38:08,840
It's just that I was hopin'
you could call my Inspector Todd,

1263
01:38:09,008 --> 01:38:12,302
my boss back home and straighten
things out, but that's all right.

1264
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:14,388
Guess I'm out of a job.
It's cool, though.

1265
01:38:14,556 --> 01:38:16,890
I think I'm gonna stay in Beverly Hills.
I like it here.

1266
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:19,518
I'm gonna start my own
private investigation company.

1267
01:38:19,686 --> 01:38:21,061
How's that sound?

1268
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:23,689
I will talk to Inspector Todd
first thing tomorrow.

1269
01:38:23,856 --> 01:38:25,357
- Will you, really?
- Yes, you bet.

1270
01:38:25,525 --> 01:38:27,776
- Thank you so much, sir.
- You're welcome.

1271
01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:37,953
How you doin'? I'm Axel Foley,
checkin' out of suite 1035.

1272
01:38:38,121 --> 01:38:40,622
One moment, sir.
I'll get your bill.

1273
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:45,502
Hey! Guys!

1274
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:48,964
You all didn't have to see me off.
But I'm very moved by the gesture.

1275
01:38:49,132 --> 01:38:52,718
Bogomil ordered us
to make sure you got out of town.

1276
01:38:54,053 --> 01:38:56,513
You know, that doesn't even matter
to me, Billy. You know what matters?

1277
01:38:56,681 --> 01:38:57,973
That you guys came down here.

1278
01:38:58,141 --> 01:39:01,184
I'm all choked up on the inside.
I got a lump in my throat.

1279
01:39:01,352 --> 01:39:04,146
You look a little misty yourself there,
Taggart.

1280
01:39:04,314 --> 01:39:06,148
- There you go, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

1281
01:39:06,316 --> 01:39:10,193
Excuse me. The Beverly Hills Police
Department is picking that up.

1282
01:39:10,361 --> 01:39:12,446
Oh, get outta here! Guys!

1283
01:39:12,614 --> 01:39:16,116
That's the last straw. That was
the last straw, you guys are too nice.

1284
01:39:16,284 --> 01:39:19,077
Sir, do you sell those
Beverly Palm robes down here?

1285
01:39:19,245 --> 01:39:21,038
Yes, we do sir,
they're $95 apiece.

1286
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:23,123
Money is no object, put 'em on my tab.

1287
01:39:23,291 --> 01:39:24,916
I have to have two of them, though.

1288
01:39:27,045 --> 01:39:30,756
Billy, you saved my life, OK?

1289
01:39:30,923 --> 01:39:32,883
I don't think I'll ever
be able to repay you.

1290
01:39:33,051 --> 01:39:34,593
But as a token of my appreciation,

1291
01:39:34,761 --> 01:39:37,346
I want you to have this
fine Beverly Palm robe.

1292
01:39:37,513 --> 01:39:39,181
Each time you get out of the shower
and you're dripping wet,

1293
01:39:39,349 --> 01:39:41,892
for the rest of your life, I want you
to think about our friendship.

1294
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:44,936
I want you to think about Axel Foley.
I love you, Billy.

1295
01:39:49,317 --> 01:39:50,734
Thanks, Axel.

1296
01:39:52,028 --> 01:39:56,365
Here, let me take this.
You should rest that arm.

1297
01:39:56,532 --> 01:39:58,700
Billy, take care of the tab, would you?

1298
01:39:59,535 --> 01:40:01,662
- Hey, Taggart.
- Here you are, sir.

1299
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:03,580
This is for you.

1300
01:40:03,748 --> 01:40:06,583
No, that's all right.
You keep it as a souvenir.

1301
01:40:08,503 --> 01:40:10,504
I already have three of 'em in my bag.

1302
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:16,385
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sir.

1303
01:40:16,552 --> 01:40:18,387
- Take it easy.
- You're not gonna say goodbye?

1304
01:40:19,597 --> 01:40:22,224
Why, ain't you guys gonna tail me
to the city limits, anyway?

1305
01:40:22,392 --> 01:40:25,936
- Yes, we are.
- I figured you would.

1306
01:40:26,104 --> 01:40:28,355
I was thinking about stopping off
and getting something to drink, though.

1307
01:40:28,523 --> 01:40:30,565
Yeah, we sorta figured you would.

1308
01:40:30,733 --> 01:40:32,109
That mean you guys
are gonna join me?

1309
01:40:32,276 --> 01:40:35,654
I don't think so, Axel,
we're still on duty.

1310
01:40:36,906 --> 01:40:40,117
Well, I don't think one beer's
gonna kill us, Billy.

1311
01:40:40,284 --> 01:40:43,370
That's right, listen to Taggart here.
Lighten up, all right?

1312
01:40:43,538 --> 01:40:45,580
One drink's not gonna kill us.

1313
01:40:47,333 --> 01:40:48,875
Hey, guys...

1314
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:51,628
If you fall too far behind,
don't be afraid to honk, OK?

1315
01:40:51,796 --> 01:40:53,463
Where we goin' anyway?

1316
01:40:53,631 --> 01:40:56,091
Don't worry about it,
just follow my lead.

1317
01:40:56,259 --> 01:40:58,635
I know the perfect place.
You guys will love it.

1318
01:40:58,803 --> 01:41:00,053
Trust me.

1319
01:41:05,803 --> 01:44:00,000
