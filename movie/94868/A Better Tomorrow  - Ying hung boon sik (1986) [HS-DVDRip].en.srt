1
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:43,823
Kit!

2
00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:49,441
Kit!

3
00:01:17,902 --> 00:01:18,438
Two Dollars

4
00:01:18,668 --> 00:01:19,166
Yes!

5
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:26,994
Mark!

6
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:27,759
Coming!

7
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:33,990
The plate

8
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:39,569
Sir!

9
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:44,555
Taste good?

10
00:03:39,778 --> 00:03:40,438
Are you alright?

11
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:48,898
Take it and go to see the doctor

12
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:49,989
Thanks

13
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:01,990
Can you read it?

14
00:04:04,297 --> 00:04:04,679
What?

15
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:06,660
Don't pretend

16
00:04:19,465 --> 00:04:21,599
Hi Tom, how are you!

17
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,394
Hi, Russ

18
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,145
Thanks

19
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:29,686
That's it!

20
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:37,064
That's great, first class

21
00:04:51,429 --> 00:04:52,635
Why don't we go out
for a drink sometimes

22
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,684
It's pleasure doing business with you

23
00:05:17,488 --> 00:05:18,943
Good!

24
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,713
Your English is improved

25
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:22,551
Even know 'of course'

26
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:23,517
Of course!

27
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:27,221
Good morning. Mark

28
00:05:27,384 --> 00:05:27,671
Good morning, Mr. Sung

29
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:28,398
Good morning

30
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:33,346
Good morning, Mr. Sung

31
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:36,255
Good morning, Mark

32
00:05:36,456 --> 00:05:38,179
That's good

33
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:42,581
Mr. Yiu

34
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:45,232
Ho, you are back!
Everything OK?

35
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:46,447
I counted already

36
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,203
Clever

37
00:05:47,404 --> 00:05:48,265
Those foreigners are easy going

38
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:50,438
Not all of them are as good as they are

39
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,050
Your weakness is too easy
to believe someone

40
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:54,744
Thanks!

41
00:05:54,945 --> 00:05:56,400
You are Shing? Sit...

42
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:58,065
No, thanks
It's better for me to stand

43
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:04,104
Good morning. Linda!

44
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:12,114
Rose!

45
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,272
There's a lot
you can learn from Ho

46
00:06:15,511 --> 00:06:16,813
He's excellent

47
00:06:17,397 --> 00:06:20,804
But I'll never be as good as him

48
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:24,029
Though mark is frivolous

49
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:25,273
But he is loyal

50
00:06:25,914 --> 00:06:27,225
Yes, he takes good care of me

51
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:28,460
What are you talking about?

52
00:06:28,632 --> 00:06:29,905
Nothing
Just talking about you!

53
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:31,015
Really?

54
00:06:32,431 --> 00:06:34,116
Your brother, Kit
graduates today

55
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,623
Oh! Yes
I forgot to buy him a present

56
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,030
I've got to go now

57
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:45,810
Ho. Take Shing with you
tomorrow to Taiwan

58
00:06:46,231 --> 00:06:47,849
Give the kid a chance

59
00:06:51,332 --> 00:06:52,442
Taiwan
Don't mistake it with Chai Wan?

60
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:54,940
Though I've been in this field for years
I'm still afraid to go

61
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:55,552
Do you know why?

62
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:56,950
Too much fighting

63
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,060
and drink

64
00:06:58,299 --> 00:06:59,601
Don't fool him

65
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:00,787
OK

66
00:07:01,074 --> 00:07:02,481
Give Kit a girl
for a graduation present

67
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:04,931
I'm no good
but I want him to be a good citizen

68
00:07:05,132 --> 00:07:05,926
But it's better to have a whore

69
00:07:08,577 --> 00:07:09,592
I want to see him to be a PhD

70
00:07:10,204 --> 00:07:11,353
Getting married

71
00:07:11,936 --> 00:07:13,238
And having his own baby

72
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:14,836
Then you'll be as
busy as a buffalo

73
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:18,884
People say, one will step on shit

74
00:07:19,114 --> 00:07:20,425
with a big mouth

75
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:21,372
You go in first

76
00:07:23,392 --> 00:07:27,660
You first I won't

77
00:07:27,832 --> 00:07:28,464
We will go in together

78
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,087
Hold it. We are police

79
00:07:47,604 --> 00:07:47,977
Search!

80
00:07:48,207 --> 00:07:48,618
Sir

81
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:49,508
Freeze

82
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:50,370
That's not funny

83
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,135
Don't turn around

84
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,910
Both of us have guns
If you don't respect me...

85
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:54,810
I won't

86
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,762
See who doesn't respecting the others

87
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:03,213
So ticklish

88
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,988
Don't...

89
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:06,811
Please...

90
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,285
Are you sure?

91
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:09,758
I have good news You'll surprise

92
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:13,548
I am an Inspector, surprise!

93
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,687
You have to work hard

94
00:08:17,424 --> 00:08:18,984
At least you've got to
be a super intendant

95
00:08:20,678 --> 00:08:21,214
Jackie!

96
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,496
She is my girlfriend

97
00:08:22,822 --> 00:08:23,587
She takes care of dad
when she has time

98
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:24,822
My brother

99
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:25,951
Hi!

100
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,119
Taking care of dad in this way!

101
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:37,349
Thanks a lot

102
00:08:37,569 --> 00:08:38,201
Don't mention it

103
00:08:39,263 --> 00:08:40,162
I've got to sit for an exam

104
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:45,072
Are you going steady

105
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,598
Don't know yet!

106
00:08:48,814 --> 00:08:51,264
You said you'll go with me!
Hurry up!

107
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,819
I really want to stay...
But...

108
00:08:54,144 --> 00:08:55,293
No need to explain. Go!

109
00:08:55,522 --> 00:08:56,020
I go first

110
00:08:56,154 --> 00:08:57,082
Go!

111
00:08:57,628 --> 00:08:58,039
Sorry

112
00:08:58,652 --> 00:08:59,695
Let's go!

113
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:00,240
Quick!

114
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,676
Bye!

115
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:10,901
Ho!

116
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:11,667
Dad!

117
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:14,127
You should quit

118
00:09:15,313 --> 00:09:17,514
Your brother doesn't know
what you have been doing

119
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,385
Still remember

120
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:22,395
You two played cop & thief
when you were kids

121
00:09:22,826 --> 00:09:24,060
He almost lost

122
00:09:25,027 --> 00:09:26,682
But he still wanted to be a cop

123
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:30,798
I don't want you to play
the same game again

124
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,405
For your brother

125
00:09:36,932 --> 00:09:38,042
Promise!

126
00:09:40,061 --> 00:09:40,693
Yes!

127
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:52,990
That's better

128
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:55,096
Excuse me...
Traffic is so bad

129
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:56,120
Yes. Traffic jam

130
00:09:56,283 --> 00:09:56,732
I am Jackie

131
00:09:56,895 --> 00:09:57,527
Sir, Traffic jam

132
00:09:57,728 --> 00:09:58,168
Give me a chance

133
00:09:58,302 --> 00:09:59,221
Please give her a chance

134
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:02,407
Are you alright?

135
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:03,269
I'm fine

136
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:04,580
Sir, the traffic is really bad

137
00:10:04,781 --> 00:10:06,121
Give her a chance please?

138
00:10:06,341 --> 00:10:07,011
OK...

139
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,695
Go!

140
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:16,370
So pity

141
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,791
Listen. Judges

142
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:50,468
Sorry

143
00:10:55,617 --> 00:10:57,301
It's you...
You made me so embarrassed

144
00:10:57,502 --> 00:10:58,957
You spoiled everything

145
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:00,498
How can I help you,

146
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:02,029
if you don't have
confidence yourself?

147
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,426
They didn't say you are out

148
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,364
How do you know you'll fail?

149
00:11:05,072 --> 00:11:06,010
Give it back to me

150
00:11:10,048 --> 00:11:11,455
I will really fail this time

151
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:23,169
Are you sure?

152
00:11:24,356 --> 00:11:26,806
This will be my last time

153
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,653
Because of Kit?

154
00:11:38,816 --> 00:11:41,237
Don't come with me
to Taiwan tomorrow

155
00:11:41,563 --> 00:11:43,831
Anything goes wrong, you're here

156
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:46,960
Then they will follow you

157
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,157
I can't do it

158
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,104
Then Shing will do it

159
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,951
He resembles Al Pacino

160
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:58,013
Please don't fool me, Mark

161
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,574
Ho, we can't do without you

162
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:03,334
I'm not mature yet

163
00:12:03,535 --> 00:12:04,550
Don't expect too much

164
00:12:06,349 --> 00:12:09,019
Don't think you can be the Big Brother
by reading the books about underworld

165
00:12:11,842 --> 00:12:13,393
Anyone ever point a gun at you?

166
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:15,661
No!

167
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:19,173
12 years ago...

168
00:12:20,551 --> 00:12:21,288
12 years,

169
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:25,365
Ho and I went to
Indonesia the first time

170
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:29,528
We had a dinner at a club
with their Big Brother

171
00:12:32,303 --> 00:12:34,437
I said something wrong

172
00:12:34,992 --> 00:12:36,542
Suddenly 2 guns were
pointing at my head

173
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,327
and I was ordered to drink
a bottle of whisky

174
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:44,629
I was so scared

175
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:48,304
Ho is really great

176
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:50,189
He drank it for me

177
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:54,467
But there was even worse

178
00:12:54,592 --> 00:12:55,903
4 guns were pointing at me then...

179
00:12:59,893 --> 00:13:01,779
Do you know what
they asked me to drink?

180
00:13:03,406 --> 00:13:04,516
Urine!

181
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:09,884
Drank urine in the club

182
00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:25,053
Learning! That's what
you call learning

183
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,049
That's our first deal

184
00:13:39,016 --> 00:13:41,111
That's history
Don't talk about it anymore

185
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:42,231
No!

186
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:51,485
Never cried since I was a kid

187
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,921
That's the first time I cried

188
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:04,261
I swore that no one would ever
point a gun at me again

189
00:14:27,832 --> 00:14:28,368
That's good!

190
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:38,082
Be careful

191
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:41,977
Hitting a sand bag more often

192
00:14:44,915 --> 00:14:45,748
I've to go tomorrow

193
00:14:50,504 --> 00:14:51,490
Regular disappear

194
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,112
I'll be back soon

195
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,059
When I'm away, take care of dad

196
00:14:59,796 --> 00:15:00,495
I will

197
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:04,132
Take care!

198
00:15:05,194 --> 00:15:05,864
Yes!

199
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:53,637
They're coming

200
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,705
Be careful, there's
something wrong here

201
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,633
How do you know?

202
00:16:03,284 --> 00:16:03,944
Intuition

203
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:12,280
Mr. Sung, how are you!

204
00:16:12,442 --> 00:16:12,911
Where is Mr. Wang?

205
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:14,356
He's not feeling well
I'm her nephew

206
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:15,562
He asked me to replace him

207
00:16:15,926 --> 00:16:16,653
How are you!

208
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:17,649
What kind of illness he has got?

209
00:16:18,893 --> 00:16:21,792
Mr. Sung, let's in and talk

210
00:16:21,993 --> 00:16:22,788
Nothing serious

211
00:16:22,979 --> 00:16:25,659
Just hiding out
for a while

212
00:16:25,697 --> 00:16:26,778
Have a cup of tea

213
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:27,544
Thanks!

214
00:16:27,707 --> 00:16:29,334
Mr. Sung, this way please!

215
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:32,358
Scared of everything
when you are getting old

216
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,353
Please sit

217
00:16:33,516 --> 00:16:34,693
Don't waste time!

218
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:36,358
Attention, head quarters

219
00:16:36,588 --> 00:16:39,966
Please check a car north
town 1086379

220
00:16:40,004 --> 00:16:41,497
It's a bit suspicious

221
00:16:49,392 --> 00:16:50,732
We know you're reliable

222
00:16:50,857 --> 00:16:53,240
I respected you
when I was a kid

223
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:55,067
Do you believe that?

224
00:16:55,268 --> 00:16:57,527
Someone paid me double to kill you

225
00:16:57,728 --> 00:17:00,235
He's crazy, who do they think I am?

226
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:01,585
I give you money

227
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:22,179
Police!

228
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:19,944
Hello!

229
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:27,323
Uncle

230
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:54,176
The boat has left, we are now miles away

231
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,110
Sung killed some of our men in Taiwan

232
00:19:00,378 --> 00:19:01,832
He is wanted by the Police

233
00:19:02,454 --> 00:19:04,454
Big brother is worried that
Ho might talk his secret

234
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:06,885
Please come with me

235
00:19:07,306 --> 00:19:08,675
I don't want to be rude

236
00:19:14,264 --> 00:19:14,828
You son of a bitch

237
00:19:15,068 --> 00:19:16,206
If you hurt my son

238
00:19:16,436 --> 00:19:17,747
I won't let you off

239
00:19:19,087 --> 00:19:20,015
Run!

240
00:19:20,274 --> 00:19:21,317
What are you doing?

241
00:19:21,518 --> 00:19:22,590
No!

242
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:32,877
Wrong number

243
00:19:39,873 --> 00:19:40,543
Go. Uncle!

244
00:19:45,146 --> 00:19:45,845
Uncle!

245
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:48,716
Jackie, what's happening?

246
00:20:37,351 --> 00:20:39,140
Be careful, Kit!

247
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:40,959
Dad, don't come out

248
00:21:14,014 --> 00:21:17,105
Dad, please don't

249
00:21:35,824 --> 00:21:40,695
Dad!

250
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:47,987
Kit, you have to forgive your brother!

251
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:14,956
Who betrayed me?

252
00:22:20,717 --> 00:22:21,377
You?

253
00:22:21,712 --> 00:22:23,588
Ho, if I did

254
00:22:24,162 --> 00:22:25,502
I wouldn't be here with you now

255
00:22:31,923 --> 00:22:33,129
I don't know if I can escape this time

256
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:55,006
Ho, what are you doing?

257
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:55,590
I'm going to surrender

258
00:22:55,714 --> 00:22:56,279
You can't

259
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:57,561
Please don't

260
00:22:57,724 --> 00:22:59,102
Please don't go

261
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,969
No

262
00:23:05,131 --> 00:23:05,868
No!

263
00:23:06,031 --> 00:23:06,500
Run!

264
00:23:11,294 --> 00:23:12,127
Ho...

265
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:12,826
Go away

266
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:14,807
I don't want to implicate another friend

267
00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:16,108
There's gun shots in the cavern

268
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:18,099
You go

269
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:18,950
No

270
00:23:19,218 --> 00:23:20,147
I insist you go

271
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:31,085
Stand and don't move

272
00:23:31,219 --> 00:23:31,851
Put down the gun

273
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,023
Did you hear me?
Put down the gun

274
00:24:28,544 --> 00:24:31,156
There're no more rules in the world

275
00:24:31,826 --> 00:24:33,798
You can't trust any one today

276
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:36,994
Even my nephew, Wang

277
00:24:37,358 --> 00:24:38,631
betrayed me

278
00:24:40,037 --> 00:24:41,597
He joined up with a new HK gang

279
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:44,411
to try to take over my business

280
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:48,268
As a result, we've lost Ho

281
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,306
We respect a faithful man

282
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,546
but not a traitor

283
00:24:59,675 --> 00:25:00,211
Hello!

284
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:02,316
Yes!

285
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:07,685
He will be in Fung Lim Restaurant tonight

286
00:25:12,193 --> 00:25:12,958
What are you gong to do?

287
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:14,585
Do you need any help?

288
00:25:15,293 --> 00:25:16,336
Do you need my men?

289
00:25:23,045 --> 00:25:23,839
Take care!

290
00:25:24,902 --> 00:25:25,763
Thanks!

291
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:01,554
Chief What's this?

292
00:28:02,386 --> 00:28:02,893
Chief

293
00:28:03,123 --> 00:28:03,726
Inside here

294
00:29:09,702 --> 00:29:11,109
I'm not scared

295
00:29:11,367 --> 00:29:14,209
My boss will post bail for me

296
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:16,401
If you've the guts
fight with me without a gun

297
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:18,257
See who is stronger?

298
00:29:21,712 --> 00:29:22,401
5703!

299
00:29:23,598 --> 00:29:24,220
Sir, what's happening?

300
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:26,105
Nothing!

301
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:36,173
Sung, what's the charge?

302
00:29:36,881 --> 00:29:38,249
Drug trafficking, attacking the police

303
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:40,584
How dare you insult Inspector Sung

304
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:41,302
Take down his statement

305
00:29:43,771 --> 00:29:44,853
Thanks!

306
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:02,442
How's that? Feeling different!

307
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:03,945
Can I give you a lift?

308
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,993
No, thanks
We are not going the same way

309
00:30:07,562 --> 00:30:08,261
I admire you

310
00:30:08,845 --> 00:30:09,917
Because of your friends

311
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:11,362
You kept quiet

312
00:30:12,223 --> 00:30:14,328
That's ridiculous
You were behind bars

313
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:16,654
The counterfeiting
racket is still strong

314
00:30:18,577 --> 00:30:19,209
Thanks!

315
00:30:21,228 --> 00:30:23,085
I'm not involved anymore

316
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:29,650
Tell your friends

317
00:30:30,272 --> 00:30:31,755
The case is still open

318
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,488
I won't let him off

319
00:30:36,464 --> 00:30:37,191
A bad guy for a day

320
00:30:37,612 --> 00:30:38,952
Will never be a good guy again

321
00:30:42,656 --> 00:30:43,259
Bye!

322
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:45,661
I'll never come back again

323
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:31,090
Stop!

324
00:32:00,249 --> 00:32:01,522
Kit, cool down

325
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:10,499
Stop fighting

326
00:32:20,528 --> 00:32:21,418
Kit, stop

327
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,041
Don't let me see you again

328
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:22,246
Manager!

329
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,629
There's no manager here

330
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,323
I'm Kin, are you looking for me?

331
00:33:32,026 --> 00:33:35,146
Uncle Chung, asked me to come see you

332
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,964
When I was doing business in Taiwan...

333
00:33:37,137 --> 00:33:39,749
Doing business?
You were in jail!

334
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:45,080
Mr. Chung asked me
to give you this letter

335
00:33:48,018 --> 00:33:50,353
Chung, he never does anything good

336
00:33:50,573 --> 00:33:52,516
But we are friends

337
00:33:53,386 --> 00:33:55,769
It's so difficult to get
a job for an ex-con

338
00:33:57,473 --> 00:33:59,291
No one will hire an ex-con

339
00:34:03,665 --> 00:34:04,593
Don't feel depressed

340
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:08,354
All these guys were prisoner before

341
00:34:11,943 --> 00:34:14,010
Some people like to adopt orphans

342
00:34:14,211 --> 00:34:16,469
I like to take care of ex-cons

343
00:34:17,781 --> 00:34:20,642
Because I was in prison too

344
00:34:24,901 --> 00:34:29,437
Everybody, here's a new man
Take care of him

345
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:31,380
He is... you are...

346
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:32,375
Sung Tse Ho

347
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:33,676
Brother Ho!

348
00:34:34,547 --> 00:34:38,595
Just call me Ho

349
00:34:38,988 --> 00:34:40,576
Social gathering?

350
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,108
Back to work

351
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:44,634
I'm not paying you for doing nothing

352
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,438
Do you have a driving license?

353
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,022
No

354
00:34:48,405 --> 00:34:50,768
Whether you pass the exam or not...

355
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:52,615
You can stay

356
00:34:53,228 --> 00:34:54,979
Thanks, Kin

357
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,204
Don't mention it
There's no Boss here

358
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,420
Take it for lunch
Thanks

359
00:36:54,988 --> 00:36:55,811
Mark!

360
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:09,343
That's not what you told me
in your letter

361
00:37:37,641 --> 00:37:40,742
Even I break my legs

362
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:43,134
I can't pay you back

363
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:49,422
It's not your fault

364
00:37:55,882 --> 00:37:57,403
I'm so glad to see you again

365
00:37:58,657 --> 00:37:59,451
Haven't seen you for so long

366
00:38:00,475 --> 00:38:01,518
You're still looking the same

367
00:38:05,586 --> 00:38:09,031
Mark. This isn't our world anymore

368
00:38:09,835 --> 00:38:11,175
Why are you still here?

369
00:38:21,357 --> 00:38:24,764
I've waited for you for 3 years

370
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,458
Let's start all over again

371
00:38:49,617 --> 00:38:54,048
Don't bother me
Pay attention to your brother

372
00:38:57,503 --> 00:39:00,058
He's following Shing everyday
That's very dangerous

373
00:39:05,169 --> 00:39:06,212
You're brothers

374
00:39:12,834 --> 00:39:15,131
Kit, we all know
you are good at your work

375
00:39:16,414 --> 00:39:17,782
I recommended your promotion,

376
00:39:18,165 --> 00:39:19,093
but it's rejected

377
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:21,352
Why?

378
00:39:29,247 --> 00:39:31,515
This guy, you know him very well

379
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,721
He disappeared 3 years ago

380
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,209
He's back after being released
from prison in Taiwan

381
00:39:39,918 --> 00:39:41,669
and got back with his
old partners again

382
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:43,009
It's none of my business

383
00:39:43,937 --> 00:39:46,100
We're investigating
underworld contacts in the police

384
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:49,334
and none of our family members
would be related, in any sense

385
00:39:51,124 --> 00:39:51,823
Understood?

386
00:39:56,043 --> 00:39:57,345
When I carry out my order

387
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,407
I've never thought of my brother

388
00:40:02,206 --> 00:40:02,800
Kit!

389
00:40:04,082 --> 00:40:05,996
You're not in Shing's case anymore

390
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:07,690
Or you'll spoil the whole matter

391
00:40:14,915 --> 00:40:16,600
Sung, Shing will meet
those Thai tonight...

392
00:40:16,762 --> 00:40:17,624
Nam!

393
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:28,122
Bottom up

394
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,433
Mark

395
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:30,543
Tell us about your stories

396
00:40:30,754 --> 00:40:31,318
Let Ho say it

397
00:40:31,548 --> 00:40:31,959
My boss says

398
00:40:32,122 --> 00:40:34,027
$18 million maximum

399
00:40:34,744 --> 00:40:35,242
OK

400
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,677
Boss, Ho is outside

401
00:40:40,553 --> 00:40:41,281
Draught beer, please

402
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:50,382
This way please

403
00:40:57,186 --> 00:40:57,952
Ho!

404
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,770
How come you didn't
inform us you're back

405
00:40:59,933 --> 00:41:00,727
You shouldn't do that

406
00:41:05,455 --> 00:41:07,493
We were good brothers once
Is that right, Mark?

407
00:41:13,312 --> 00:41:14,690
Ho, if you didn't take care of me

408
00:41:14,938 --> 00:41:16,116
I would never have what I have now

409
00:41:17,685 --> 00:41:18,422
Oh no

410
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:22,221
You deserve it

411
00:41:22,384 --> 00:41:23,083
I don't have the ability

412
00:41:23,504 --> 00:41:24,614
It's Mark who gave me the chance

413
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:27,638
Mark, if you need my help in the future

414
00:41:27,973 --> 00:41:29,083
Just say so

415
00:41:29,408 --> 00:41:31,791
Don't bullshit
Let's drink

416
00:41:31,964 --> 00:41:33,141
You takes real care of brothers

417
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:35,696
Cheers!

418
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:36,452
Cheers!

419
00:41:40,644 --> 00:41:43,361
This is for my leg

420
00:41:46,232 --> 00:41:46,931
Happy

421
00:41:56,386 --> 00:41:58,042
Come to see me when you're free

422
00:41:58,501 --> 00:41:59,420
There's a lot we can talk

423
00:41:59,774 --> 00:42:00,501
I'm not interested

424
00:42:01,535 --> 00:42:02,454
You will be

425
00:42:03,803 --> 00:42:04,741
I have to go

426
00:42:13,124 --> 00:42:13,622
Sung Tse Ho!

427
00:42:16,637 --> 00:42:17,172
Follow me

428
00:42:29,728 --> 00:42:30,044
What are you doing?

429
00:42:30,178 --> 00:42:30,810
Don't move!

430
00:42:33,556 --> 00:42:34,293
What did Shing tell you?

431
00:42:35,604 --> 00:42:36,073
Bullshit!

432
00:42:37,164 --> 00:42:37,997
Don't fool me!

433
00:42:38,638 --> 00:42:39,940
Business or bullshit?

434
00:42:40,772 --> 00:42:41,605
Bullshit, really

435
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,002
Is there something arriving the day after?

436
00:42:43,366 --> 00:42:44,160
Don't know

437
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,911
Where to load and when?

438
00:42:46,495 --> 00:42:47,385
Don't know

439
00:42:49,175 --> 00:42:50,859
How can you be a Big Brother
knowing nothing?

440
00:42:53,644 --> 00:42:54,180
Kit!

441
00:42:55,433 --> 00:42:57,635
Don't call me Kit
call me inspector!

442
00:43:06,544 --> 00:43:11,932
I'm not a Big Brother anymore

443
00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:20,938
Where do you work?

444
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:23,655
United Taxi Co

445
00:43:25,962 --> 00:43:26,823
Decent business?

446
00:43:30,498 --> 00:43:31,445
Robbing with a taxi?

447
00:43:34,068 --> 00:43:35,149
Where do you live?

448
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:37,159
United Taxi Co

449
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:40,862
Someone still accepted you thief

450
00:43:43,331 --> 00:43:45,494
Thief... Doesn't he have a name?

451
00:43:45,695 --> 00:43:46,767
Don't think you are great to have a gun

452
00:43:46,939 --> 00:43:48,432
I'll shoot you down, cripple

453
00:43:52,691 --> 00:43:55,581
Don't point at my head with a gun

454
00:43:56,012 --> 00:43:57,352
If you've got the guts,

455
00:43:58,213 --> 00:44:00,060
then shoot me...

456
00:44:01,314 --> 00:44:01,907
Kit!

457
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:05,515
Sir, I know I owe you too much

458
00:44:06,223 --> 00:44:07,687
Give me a chance!

459
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:09,477
Give you a chance?

460
00:44:10,089 --> 00:44:11,611
I beg you to give me one!

461
00:44:13,477 --> 00:44:14,425
Do you know because of you

462
00:44:14,846 --> 00:44:16,252
I lost my chance of promotion

463
00:44:17,372 --> 00:44:18,616
Because you are an
agent of the underworld

464
00:44:23,985 --> 00:44:25,028
Don't leave HK

465
00:44:30,052 --> 00:44:31,507
I'll be back to get you

466
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,707
Come, have a cup of tea

467
00:45:24,879 --> 00:45:26,496
Thanks!

468
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:28,573
I will deduct it from your salary

469
00:45:28,736 --> 00:45:29,846
You are mean

470
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,033
Otherwise, how can I support my family?

471
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:31,607
You're right

472
00:45:35,923 --> 00:45:38,344
There's a beautiful girl
staring at you

473
00:45:38,545 --> 00:45:39,110
Your girlfriend?

474
00:45:46,718 --> 00:45:47,254
Please come in!

475
00:45:47,895 --> 00:45:48,728
No!

476
00:45:51,091 --> 00:45:52,202
I want your help

477
00:45:54,862 --> 00:45:56,068
Can you leave HK for a while?

478
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:00,499
I don't want to see
Kit getting mad

479
00:46:00,738 --> 00:46:04,432
He can't take this pressure
neither can I

480
00:46:06,356 --> 00:46:10,270
So I think it's better for
you to be away for a while

481
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:11,878
I won't leave!

482
00:46:14,653 --> 00:46:17,964
I want Kit to see that
I'm in my new life

483
00:46:18,873 --> 00:46:19,696
Can you give me a chance

484
00:46:20,089 --> 00:46:21,362
to prove myself?

485
00:46:27,687 --> 00:46:28,922
Don't you see I want to skate

486
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:32,884
Riding bicycle with him too?

487
00:46:33,946 --> 00:46:35,181
I don't want to lose this brother

488
00:46:42,722 --> 00:46:44,215
Ho!

489
00:46:46,464 --> 00:46:47,603
Don't stay here, go in!

490
00:46:48,253 --> 00:46:49,804
There's no use just staying here

491
00:46:51,096 --> 00:46:53,096
Ho can handle his own matter, go in!

492
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:57,575
Who are they?

493
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,489
They're not good

494
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:01,240
Ho, Big Brother wants to see you

495
00:47:02,168 --> 00:47:02,800
I'm busy

496
00:47:03,422 --> 00:47:04,360
Give me some face

497
00:47:04,723 --> 00:47:05,671
Just come with me

498
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:11,011
Hello!

499
00:47:11,174 --> 00:47:12,800
Ho, Mark is with us

500
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:14,102
Come over too

501
00:47:15,069 --> 00:47:17,078
No, thanks
I am not interested...

502
00:47:17,853 --> 00:47:19,279
You may not interested in business

503
00:47:19,509 --> 00:47:20,552
How about your brother?

504
00:47:20,724 --> 00:47:21,519
Doesn't it raise your interest?

505
00:47:22,093 --> 00:47:22,725
I'll wait for you!

506
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:24,801
OK!

507
00:47:26,533 --> 00:47:27,423
Kin, I want to go out for a while

508
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,098
You have to have principle
don't be afraid

509
00:47:32,735 --> 00:47:33,424
Be straight!

510
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:39,204
Ho, please!

511
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:46,142
You'll never be cleaned once
you belong to the underworld

512
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:13,408
Ho!

513
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:14,231
Ho!

514
00:48:15,676 --> 00:48:17,561
Ho, so glad you're back

515
00:48:18,489 --> 00:48:19,437
How are you, Mr. Yiu?

516
00:48:20,403 --> 00:48:22,375
Fine, thanks

517
00:48:22,643 --> 00:48:23,753
Come, talk to Shing!

518
00:48:25,868 --> 00:48:26,786
Not you?

519
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,906
It's the same as talking to Shing

520
00:48:30,624 --> 00:48:33,811
I'm too old to make decisions

521
00:48:35,122 --> 00:48:35,983
Ho, sit please

522
00:48:38,893 --> 00:48:39,878
We can make big money

523
00:48:40,462 --> 00:48:42,051
I really hope to cooperate with you again

524
00:48:43,907 --> 00:48:44,673
How?

525
00:48:45,247 --> 00:48:46,424
You're still our Big Brother

526
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:48,376
Mark handles the trafficking of money

527
00:48:48,798 --> 00:48:52,530
I'll take care of the drugs
make money for our company

528
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:55,525
We need you to contact the old clients

529
00:48:57,889 --> 00:48:58,875
You haven't got to the point yet

530
00:49:00,731 --> 00:49:04,521
With your brother's assistance
That would be perfect!

531
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:08,110
What else to have your
own man in the police!

532
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:13,029
Come, I have something to tell you

533
00:49:22,896 --> 00:49:24,073
How about if I don't accept?

534
00:49:26,886 --> 00:49:27,518
Ho

535
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:29,499
I kept Mark because of you

536
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,461
Your brother is
following everything

537
00:49:34,456 --> 00:49:36,868
If it wasn't you
he's dead already!

538
00:49:40,016 --> 00:49:45,155
Shing, one is my brother
the other is my friend

539
00:49:45,404 --> 00:49:46,457
How would I feel comfortable
if I said yes?

540
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:50,993
It doesn't matter for you to insult me

541
00:49:51,634 --> 00:49:52,974
But not my friends

542
00:50:00,994 --> 00:50:02,707
If you hurt my brother

543
00:50:03,511 --> 00:50:05,071
You won't live long

544
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:36,585
We've wanted Mark Lee

545
00:50:36,853 --> 00:50:38,307
for 3 years

546
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,891
But we can't take him back legally

547
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,269
Otherwise,

548
00:50:42,595 --> 00:50:45,408
we can control the syndicate

549
00:50:45,763 --> 00:50:47,160
The Roc Police Dept is willing
to give information

550
00:50:47,322 --> 00:50:49,591
to the Interpol to the
Hong Kong Government

551
00:50:49,811 --> 00:50:51,782
The US Government has also taken action

552
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:52,586
I see!

553
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,538
We've some information recently

554
00:50:54,988 --> 00:50:58,280
in 2 days there'll be counterfeit
shipped to Taiwan

555
00:50:58,529 --> 00:51:00,280
and 500 kg heroin!

556
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,673
Though I can't do
this case myself

557
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:04,749
I hope to see

558
00:51:04,922 --> 00:51:06,769
Mark and his men being charged

559
00:51:14,052 --> 00:51:16,597
Boss, Ho is too much
Let's kill him

560
00:51:17,277 --> 00:51:19,889
Not necessary

561
00:51:30,206 --> 00:51:31,153
Do as planned

562
00:51:40,714 --> 00:51:41,575
I gave you the money already

563
00:51:41,709 --> 00:51:42,599
Where do we load the thing?

564
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,475
I'll give you the address

565
00:51:47,489 --> 00:51:48,016
Be careful

566
00:51:53,518 --> 00:51:54,246
Get in!

567
00:52:00,256 --> 00:52:00,887
Come back!

568
00:52:06,936 --> 00:52:07,730
Did you have dinner yet?

569
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:14,458
What are you doing?

570
00:52:46,938 --> 00:52:49,178
Mr. Mok, its Kit, I've got hints

571
00:52:49,656 --> 00:52:51,436
That Thai will deal with Shing tomorrow

572
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:54,030
Time and location should be...

573
00:52:54,154 --> 00:52:55,618
OK, you hand in the hints tomorrow

574
00:52:55,915 --> 00:52:56,843
and there will be no concern of yours

575
00:52:57,063 --> 00:52:57,628
Why?

576
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:58,949
You are not involved

577
00:52:59,236 --> 00:53:00,212
I'm afraid that you'll
spoil the whole thing

578
00:53:01,695 --> 00:53:02,643
Give me a chance?

579
00:53:02,844 --> 00:53:03,313
I have told you that

580
00:53:03,542 --> 00:53:05,141
There is no hero in the police

581
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:06,767
What are you doing now?

582
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,425
Do you know that
today is my birthday?

583
00:54:00,829 --> 00:54:01,939
Can you look at me?

584
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,183
You'd look

585
00:54:03,422 --> 00:54:04,695
a vase

586
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:06,666
But not me! Today is my birthday!

587
00:54:08,944 --> 00:54:12,284
This is your home
not the police barrack

588
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:23,854
Jackie

589
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:30,879
Happy birthday

590
00:54:34,649 --> 00:54:35,597
I didn't forget

591
00:54:48,669 --> 00:54:50,516
Blow out the candles

592
00:55:03,704 --> 00:55:04,307
What wish did you make?

593
00:55:04,536 --> 00:55:05,905
You really want to know?

594
00:55:06,355 --> 00:55:07,245
What is it?

595
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:08,651
Promise not to lose your temper

596
00:55:09,197 --> 00:55:10,211
Say it

597
00:55:12,939 --> 00:55:15,169
The reunion of the two of you

598
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:23,657
Don't be angry

599
00:55:24,394 --> 00:55:25,026
Nothing

600
00:55:26,605 --> 00:55:28,634
Don't get angry on my birthday

601
00:55:29,313 --> 00:55:30,557
I don't let you get angry
Otherwise I will get angry

602
00:55:33,304 --> 00:55:34,003
Smile

603
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,634
Let me open it

604
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:46,712
Anything happens?

605
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,085
I want to speak to Kit

606
00:55:56,425 --> 00:55:57,124
Who is it?

607
00:55:58,215 --> 00:55:59,076
Don't be mad

608
00:55:59,363 --> 00:56:01,220
Keep your promise

609
00:56:14,503 --> 00:56:15,202
Sit

610
00:56:15,364 --> 00:56:15,929
Thanks

611
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,623
Today is your birthday?

612
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:18,608
Yes

613
00:56:19,422 --> 00:56:20,149
Have a piece of cake

614
00:56:20,695 --> 00:56:21,556
Why do you treat him that nice?

615
00:56:22,513 --> 00:56:23,824
Don't do that

616
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,767
I don't care how you treat me

617
00:56:30,494 --> 00:56:32,083
I'm here to tell you that

618
00:56:32,763 --> 00:56:34,188
Shing tries to tramp you

619
00:56:34,715 --> 00:56:35,825
Be careful

620
00:56:36,696 --> 00:56:37,490
Thank you!

621
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,586
Don't trust those crummy

622
00:56:40,265 --> 00:56:42,400
It's always a trick if you

623
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,601
have clues too easily

624
00:56:46,141 --> 00:56:47,998
Do you think I am as dumb as before?

625
00:56:48,256 --> 00:56:50,553
I only want to help you

626
00:56:50,678 --> 00:56:51,472
Help me or trick me?

627
00:56:55,185 --> 00:56:57,377
Do you know you are my burden

628
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:00,028
Can you trust me one more time?

629
00:57:00,965 --> 00:57:03,923
Trust you?

630
00:57:04,124 --> 00:57:04,564
Kit!

631
00:57:10,449 --> 00:57:10,909
Jackie!

632
00:57:13,674 --> 00:57:14,430
Ho!

633
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,900
He didn't change a bit on my impression

634
00:57:19,483 --> 00:57:22,287
Don't give up

635
00:57:22,709 --> 00:57:23,685
Don't let the other look down upon you

636
00:57:29,896 --> 00:57:31,006
Why can't you forgive him?

637
00:57:31,618 --> 00:57:32,824
Let him start a new life?

638
00:57:33,025 --> 00:57:34,422
He killed dad indirectly!

639
00:57:35,542 --> 00:57:37,064
Why do you force me to accept him

640
00:57:43,686 --> 00:57:44,997
He can't blame anyone
for choosing the wrong way

641
00:57:53,294 --> 00:57:56,290
I'm the cop, he's the thief

642
00:57:58,922 --> 00:58:02,769
We're going opposite

643
00:58:44,169 --> 00:58:44,992
I'm a cop

644
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,007
What's happening? Kin!

645
00:58:56,304 --> 00:58:58,275
Your brother is having an operation

646
00:59:00,256 --> 00:59:01,184
He's now in Princess Margaret Hospital

647
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:02,074
Hurry up!

648
00:59:02,495 --> 00:59:03,060
OK

649
00:59:09,453 --> 00:59:10,860
What happened to my brother?

650
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:12,419
He is being tricked by Shing

651
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:13,817
He purposely did it

652
00:59:15,271 --> 00:59:16,094
How is he?

653
00:59:16,611 --> 00:59:17,205
You can't get in

654
00:59:56,748 --> 00:59:57,992
I tried to stop him

655
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:59,073
But he insisted

656
00:59:59,906 --> 01:00:00,987
I hope you can cooperate with the police

657
01:00:01,437 --> 01:00:02,815
and let's know your location

658
01:00:52,312 --> 01:00:55,498
It's easy to be a hero. Jump

659
01:00:57,613 --> 01:00:59,968
It's not the same now
you don't have any choice

660
01:01:00,551 --> 01:01:02,331
Get along with us

661
01:01:03,394 --> 01:01:05,011
And don't tell the police

662
01:01:05,241 --> 01:01:06,667
We know each other well

663
01:01:38,544 --> 01:01:43,042
What's happening?

664
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,837
You are out of this case

665
01:01:54,354 --> 01:01:55,369
Stop!

666
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:08,556
Fight!

667
01:02:24,404 --> 01:02:24,997
Stop it!

668
01:02:25,773 --> 01:02:29,218
Can we make a deal

669
01:02:29,763 --> 01:02:30,692
It's not worthwhile

670
01:02:31,007 --> 01:02:32,156
breaking rules again

671
01:02:44,903 --> 01:02:45,764
Stop fighting

672
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:49,277
Release him

673
01:02:49,497 --> 01:02:51,468
Ho!

674
01:02:53,459 --> 01:02:54,597
You idiot, don't go!

675
01:02:54,932 --> 01:02:57,507
Stay if you have guts!

676
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,210
You, son of bitch!

677
01:03:01,765 --> 01:03:02,684
All bastards!

678
01:03:05,852 --> 01:03:07,192
Kin. That's my fault

679
01:03:07,737 --> 01:03:08,847
I don't want you to be involved

680
01:03:10,608 --> 01:03:12,388
You've no principle

681
01:03:12,781 --> 01:03:14,207
They fight because they are scared

682
01:03:14,695 --> 01:03:17,470
If you hit them back then they win

683
01:03:23,442 --> 01:03:25,164
Why do you want to change?

684
01:03:25,423 --> 01:03:26,188
What for?

685
01:03:26,695 --> 01:03:29,413
Who's he?

686
01:03:29,576 --> 01:03:30,619
Kin! Ho!

687
01:03:30,983 --> 01:03:31,643
Come and have a look

688
01:03:31,997 --> 01:03:33,079
Come over

689
01:03:33,213 --> 01:03:39,347
Mark...

690
01:03:39,471 --> 01:03:41,098
Emergency box

691
01:03:41,385 --> 01:03:42,850
Quick!

692
01:03:48,927 --> 01:03:49,941
Kin, what shall we do?

693
01:03:52,056 --> 01:03:54,152
You go!

694
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:15,876
Police. Stop for searching

695
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,479
That's too much, officer, I'm injured!

696
01:04:22,642 --> 01:04:24,431
I'll send the quotation to the Station

697
01:04:24,757 --> 01:04:26,058
Smart ass

698
01:04:48,443 --> 01:04:51,409
I did notice the beauty of HK at night

699
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:56,520
But it doesn't last

700
01:04:57,199 --> 01:04:58,596
It's not worthwhile

701
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,071
Ho!

702
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:08,080
Let's start all over again

703
01:05:09,267 --> 01:05:10,215
After this last time

704
01:05:10,636 --> 01:05:12,014
then leave HK

705
01:05:13,449 --> 01:05:13,985
Mark!

706
01:05:14,215 --> 01:05:15,870
We've never been scared before

707
01:05:16,703 --> 01:05:18,043
Why are we scared of Shing...

708
01:05:18,464 --> 01:05:21,392
Don't push me
I'll never get involved again

709
01:05:26,732 --> 01:05:29,345
Those are merely memories

710
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:31,996
I'm still alive

711
01:05:33,374 --> 01:05:35,987
Even you do 10 times, 100 times

712
01:05:36,149 --> 01:05:36,819
Then what?

713
01:05:37,049 --> 01:05:38,446
Even you kill Shing?

714
01:05:45,576 --> 01:05:46,877
I lost my brother already

715
01:05:47,394 --> 01:05:49,011
I don't want to lost you too

716
01:05:50,294 --> 01:05:52,112
Mark, don't you understand?

717
01:05:52,246 --> 01:05:52,849
I don't want sympathy

718
01:05:53,615 --> 01:05:54,476
You didn't owe me anything?

719
01:05:57,806 --> 01:05:58,696
I never force my friends
doing things unwillingly

720
01:05:59,816 --> 01:06:01,634
I've my principle

721
01:06:02,783 --> 01:06:03,797
I don't want to loose

722
01:06:04,257 --> 01:06:06,161
for my whole life

723
01:06:08,276 --> 01:06:09,453
Do you think I like begging?

724
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:14,114
I've been waiting 3 years
for this one chance

725
01:06:15,272 --> 01:06:15,932
The only thing to prove

726
01:06:16,133 --> 01:06:17,559
is not my brilliance

727
01:06:17,789 --> 01:06:18,420
but my determination

728
01:06:18,592 --> 01:06:20,143
to regain the losses

729
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:32,507
What did you look like?

730
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:35,732
We were scolded when we were bad

731
01:06:36,249 --> 01:06:39,053
But when we turn to be good
we are being followed!

732
01:06:40,364 --> 01:06:41,293
Did you fight for a chance?

733
01:06:43,015 --> 01:06:43,752
You didn't

734
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:45,436
No!

735
01:06:50,365 --> 01:06:51,312
Same as you

736
01:06:55,916 --> 01:06:56,423
Mark!

737
01:07:25,075 --> 01:07:25,937
What happened to you?

738
01:07:27,114 --> 01:07:28,128
I just want to take back something

739
01:07:44,905 --> 01:07:45,661
Stand over that side

740
01:07:46,244 --> 01:07:46,838
Go and take the plate

741
01:07:47,651 --> 01:07:49,269
You'll be in big trouble

742
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:51,891
Think twice before you do it

743
01:07:58,695 --> 01:07:59,872
Stop for a moment

744
01:08:10,964 --> 01:08:11,404
Run!

745
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:12,390
Open the door!

746
01:08:14,667 --> 01:08:15,328
Thanks. Mr. Chan!

747
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:18,553
Go after them

748
01:10:02,177 --> 01:10:03,287
You idiot!

749
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,134
I told you that's too much

750
01:10:06,206 --> 01:10:07,029
Idiot

751
01:10:07,546 --> 01:10:10,120
If Ho hands the plate to the police

752
01:10:10,388 --> 01:10:11,211
Not only you will die but

753
01:10:11,537 --> 01:10:13,384
even the syndicate will collapse

754
01:10:13,613 --> 01:10:14,140
That's enough

755
01:10:14,312 --> 01:10:15,355
Don't call me idiot

756
01:10:15,815 --> 01:10:17,240
What did you call me
when I gave you money?

757
01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:19,413
I regret to have you

758
01:10:19,997 --> 01:10:22,447
I'll kill you if you don't
bring me back the plate

759
01:10:22,963 --> 01:10:23,633
Kill me then

760
01:10:24,246 --> 01:10:25,863
I betrayed Ho 3 years ago

761
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:27,595
Would I be scared of him now?

762
01:10:31,844 --> 01:10:33,021
You have to pay him back

763
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:34,801
We've to share

764
01:10:35,002 --> 01:10:36,151
the problem together!

765
01:10:42,984 --> 01:10:43,491
Hello!

766
01:10:45,386 --> 01:10:48,123
Ho, why did you give me such a problem?

767
01:10:48,353 --> 01:10:49,779
Mr. Yiu. I want to speak to Shing

768
01:10:50,554 --> 01:10:52,458
Shing? Wait a minute

769
01:10:53,654 --> 01:10:57,569
Ask him to give us back the plate

770
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:01,339
Ho, don't fool me

771
01:11:01,827 --> 01:11:03,674
We can compromise

772
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:04,717
10pm tonight.

773
01:11:04,985 --> 01:11:07,856
Go to Temple with US$ 2 million
for the exchange of the plate

774
01:11:07,923 --> 01:11:10,058
and have a boat ready for me at The Bay

775
01:11:10,421 --> 01:11:11,397
That's simple?

776
01:11:11,627 --> 01:11:12,163
I want cash

777
01:11:13,484 --> 01:11:14,278
You! Yourself!

778
01:11:14,632 --> 01:11:15,264
I will be there

779
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:25,322
What did Ho say?

780
01:11:26,355 --> 01:11:27,494
What did he say?

781
01:11:30,442 --> 01:11:31,006
What?

782
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,959
He said he wants to have dinner with you

783
01:11:33,093 --> 01:11:34,748
OK, I'll wait for him

784
01:11:39,122 --> 01:11:39,505
Sir!

785
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:40,930
Sir!

786
01:11:41,907 --> 01:11:42,404
Come in!

787
01:11:43,629 --> 01:11:44,577
Mr. Mok, I've information

788
01:11:44,835 --> 01:11:46,596
Ho, Mark and Shing had a quarrel

789
01:11:46,787 --> 01:11:48,194
Then Ho and Mark blackmailed Shing

790
01:11:48,414 --> 01:11:49,429
and they're having a deal tonight

791
01:11:52,022 --> 01:11:52,912
Did you know the time and place?

792
01:11:53,113 --> 01:11:53,965
Later

793
01:11:55,506 --> 01:11:57,410
Hello. I'm...

794
01:11:59,659 --> 01:12:00,319
Thanks!

795
01:12:02,501 --> 01:12:03,190
2 minutes ago

796
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:05,305
Shing debited US$2 million from the bank

797
01:12:05,755 --> 01:12:06,578
Everyone gets ready

798
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:07,698
for order

799
01:12:08,023 --> 01:12:08,617
Yes, Sir!

800
01:12:09,554 --> 01:12:11,076
Mr. Mok. Let me in

801
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:12,646
You should be in the hospital

802
01:12:12,904 --> 01:12:13,507
What are you doing here?

803
01:12:16,196 --> 01:12:18,464
I'm fine

804
01:12:18,656 --> 01:12:19,766
You've a paid leave for a few days

805
01:12:22,196 --> 01:12:23,603
See, I can lift the chair easily

806
01:12:24,053 --> 01:12:25,230
You're not included

807
01:12:27,115 --> 01:12:28,494
My brother is the thief
Not me

808
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:31,039
Why do you

809
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,188
give me pressure?

810
01:12:32,609 --> 01:12:34,073
If you still remember the rules
you shouldn't get involved

811
01:12:34,236 --> 01:12:35,030
I've been following Shing

812
01:12:35,231 --> 01:12:36,092
Since my bad died three years ago.

813
01:12:36,284 --> 01:12:36,848
But you and Ho are brothers!

814
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,188
I know this case most thoroughly

815
01:12:38,389 --> 01:12:40,935
Don't oppress me
I want to lock him up myself

816
01:12:42,896 --> 01:12:45,031
I'll lock him up

817
01:12:47,653 --> 01:12:48,859
I'll

818
01:12:52,533 --> 01:12:55,280
Kit. Be practical

819
01:13:45,322 --> 01:13:46,183
Jackie

820
01:13:51,868 --> 01:13:53,619
I'm leaving HK tonight

821
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:56,069
You are giving up?

822
01:13:57,935 --> 01:13:58,500
Can you give

823
01:13:58,892 --> 01:13:59,715
this packet

824
01:13:59,849 --> 01:14:00,959
to Kit tonight before 9

825
01:14:01,543 --> 01:14:03,361
It's very important to him

826
01:14:07,515 --> 01:14:08,749
Will you come back?

827
01:14:27,593 --> 01:14:29,354
Kit, your brother is leaving tonight

828
01:14:29,612 --> 01:14:31,229
He asked me to give this packet to you

829
01:14:32,225 --> 01:14:34,674
Kit. The plate I gave you

830
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:37,105
is the proof to charge Shing

831
01:14:37,785 --> 01:14:40,110
We're having a dealing tonight at The Bay

832
01:14:40,493 --> 01:14:42,857
You can put me in prison if you like to

833
01:14:43,211 --> 01:14:45,249
I decided not to stay in HK

834
01:14:46,953 --> 01:14:48,800
What are you doing?

835
01:14:49,154 --> 01:14:49,948
I have to grab him

836
01:14:50,494 --> 01:14:51,795
No. You can't

837
01:14:51,996 --> 01:14:52,523
No

838
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:53,901
Go away!

839
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:59,748
Kit...

840
01:15:09,653 --> 01:15:11,557
Where's Ho? They are late

841
01:15:16,802 --> 01:15:17,634
Do you know what to say?

842
01:15:44,134 --> 01:15:45,445
Do you believe in god?

843
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:49,407
I'm the god

844
01:15:51,742 --> 01:15:52,910
God is a human

845
01:15:55,187 --> 01:15:57,187
Anyone will be god
if he can control his life

846
01:15:58,699 --> 01:16:02,518
But sometimes you couldn't

847
01:16:05,915 --> 01:16:07,188
You'll either gain or loose

848
01:16:17,122 --> 01:16:17,983
Hold it!

849
01:16:21,017 --> 01:16:21,581
Money?

850
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:25,610
Plate?

851
01:16:26,319 --> 01:16:27,333
Hand it to the police

852
01:16:34,271 --> 01:16:34,999
Don't

853
01:16:36,061 --> 01:16:37,171
There's a bomb

854
01:16:37,812 --> 01:16:39,095
I'm not a dummy

855
01:16:44,014 --> 01:16:45,085
You scared?

856
01:16:46,119 --> 01:16:47,545
How can we go on with the game
if you are scared?

857
01:17:20,925 --> 01:17:22,514
Shit!

858
01:17:25,873 --> 01:17:28,103
After Ho arrived
he had a quarrel with Master

859
01:17:28,332 --> 01:17:29,787
He asked for US$ 2 million

860
01:17:30,026 --> 01:17:31,644
He'll be at sea tonight

861
01:17:31,816 --> 01:17:33,634
Then I heard a shot

862
01:17:33,797 --> 01:17:34,869
That's him

863
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:36,276
Are you sure?

864
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:37,261
Yes!

865
01:17:38,036 --> 01:17:38,802
Do you want to be the witness?

866
01:17:38,965 --> 01:17:40,238
Yes!

867
01:18:15,532 --> 01:18:16,671
I know you'll do that already

868
01:18:17,704 --> 01:18:18,393
You'll lose

869
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:19,350
Get out!

870
01:18:20,508 --> 01:18:24,011
Get out...

871
01:18:24,537 --> 01:18:25,992
If you're better, release him!

872
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:31,131
Come over

873
01:18:31,877 --> 01:18:32,605
Go!

874
01:18:52,405 --> 01:18:53,171
Ho, on board

875
01:18:54,233 --> 01:18:54,960
You go first

876
01:18:57,678 --> 01:18:58,884
You said we'll go together

877
01:19:01,095 --> 01:19:02,109
I've something to do

878
01:19:06,234 --> 01:19:07,574
I'll meet you

879
01:19:10,799 --> 01:19:12,770
Mark. Go!

880
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,905
I'll wait for you

881
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:05,597
Go!

882
01:20:23,579 --> 01:20:24,335
Release him

883
01:20:24,469 --> 01:20:25,445
Otherwise, I'll kill your brother

884
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:27,273
Don't do it

885
01:20:29,895 --> 01:20:30,795
One for each

886
01:20:38,585 --> 01:20:39,149
Go!

887
01:20:42,068 --> 01:20:42,662
Go!

888
01:21:00,711 --> 01:21:01,505
I won't let you off

889
01:21:03,333 --> 01:21:04,194
I know!

890
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:18,683
Kit!

891
01:23:22,012 --> 01:23:22,941
Come over

892
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:05,589
You

893
01:25:08,029 --> 01:25:10,125
Look at your brother

894
01:25:13,073 --> 01:25:14,087
Look!

895
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:19,934
No matter what he had done

896
01:25:20,164 --> 01:25:21,169
He paid you back now

897
01:25:26,834 --> 01:25:27,916
He has the guts to change

898
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:30,347
What can't you forgive him?

899
01:25:30,662 --> 01:25:31,428
Why?

900
01:25:37,467 --> 01:25:38,510
For a brother...

901
01:26:24,121 --> 01:26:24,781
Shing!

902
01:26:24,953 --> 01:26:27,049
Shing!

903
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:55,788
You can't get over, Miss

904
01:26:58,611 --> 01:26:59,587
Shing!

905
01:27:05,377 --> 01:27:07,789
Ho, you're being surrounded

906
01:27:08,152 --> 01:27:09,396
In 3 minutes

907
01:27:09,684 --> 01:27:11,310
Come out unarmed

908
01:27:24,795 --> 01:27:25,589
No more bullets

909
01:27:27,828 --> 01:27:28,833
I'm going to surrender

910
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:30,412
I'll be alright

911
01:27:31,082 --> 01:27:31,848
You'll not

912
01:27:33,953 --> 01:27:36,728
I've money, 3 days later

913
01:27:36,929 --> 01:27:38,097
I'll be released

914
01:27:38,901 --> 01:27:41,198
I've money, can change black to white

915
01:27:42,384 --> 01:27:44,806
I learned it from you

916
01:27:45,389 --> 01:27:46,365
But your brother,

917
01:27:47,016 --> 01:27:49,342
because of you
he's from white to black

918
01:27:49,954 --> 01:27:50,777
You tramp him

919
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:02,275
Kit. You didn't do it wrong

920
01:29:02,533 --> 01:29:03,902
We are on different routes

921
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,357
Yours are right

922
01:29:15,568 --> 01:29:17,089
I was wrong before

923
01:29:18,889 --> 01:29:22,037
I want to be back on the right one now
