1
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:06,842

2
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,214

3
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,948

4
00:01:13,023 --> 00:01:16,151

5
00:01:16,226 --> 00:01:20,322

6
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,220

7
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,633

8
00:01:27,704 --> 00:01:30,070

9
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,404

10
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,901

11
00:02:39,976 --> 00:02:43,605

12
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:19,306
Sir.

13
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:20,645
General.

14
00:03:21,317 --> 00:03:23,444
- General.
- Sir.

15
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:32,654

16
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,271
Lean and hungry.

17
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:55,212
- Still nothing?
- Not a sign.

18
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,174
- How long has he been gone?
- Nearly two hours.

19
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:02,988
Will they fight, sir?

20
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,550
We shall know soon enough.

21
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:07,256
Soldier, I said to move
those catapults forward.

22
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:09,696
- They're out of range.
- The range is good.

23
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:14,658
- The danger to the cavalry.
- Is acceptable. Agreed?

24
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:25,576
They say no.

25
00:04:34,724 --> 00:04:36,783
Steady. Steady.

26
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,900
People should know when they're conquered.

27
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,151
Would you, Quintus?

28
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,387
Would I?

29
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:27,804
- Strength and honor.
- Strength and honor.

30
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,578
At my signal, unleash hell.

31
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:00,833
Load the catapults.

32
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:03,667
Infantry form up for advance.

33
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:07,514
- Archers ready.
- Archers.

34
00:06:07,651 --> 00:06:09,141
- Knock.
- Knock.

35
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,308
Patres.

36
00:06:34,377 --> 00:06:36,208
Maximus.

37
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:41,510
Three weeks from now, I will
be harvesting my crops.

38
00:06:41,852 --> 00:06:46,312
Imagine where you will be, and it will be so.

39
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:50,356
Hold the line. Stay with me.

40
00:06:50,427 --> 00:06:53,089
If you find yourself alone,

41
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:56,188
riding in green fields
with the sun on your face,

42
00:06:57,434 --> 00:06:59,561
do not be troubled.

43
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:04,066
For you are in Elysium,
and you're already dead.

44
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:07,870
Brothers,

45
00:07:09,246 --> 00:07:11,077
what we do in life

46
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,104
echoes in eternity.

47
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,223
- Pull.
- Pull.

48
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:23,589
Pull.

49
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,234
Catapults ready, sir.

50
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:54,287
Archers, ignite.

51
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,985
- Ignite.
- Ignite.

52
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:05,661
Archers, draw.

53
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:10,503
Loose.

54
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,760
All right, men, ready.

55
00:08:47,544 --> 00:08:49,432
Hold the line.

56
00:08:57,687 --> 00:08:59,814
Loose. Loose.

57
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:01,379
Reload.

58
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:08,352
Hold the line.

59
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,831
- Draw.
- Loose.

60
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:15,166
Stay with me.

61
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,740
Stay with me.

62
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:53,596
Roma Victor.

63
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:28,620
Roma Victor.

64
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:37,163

65
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:12,932
Do you think he's really dying?

66
00:13:14,344 --> 00:13:16,335
He's been dying for ten years.

67
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:20,739
If he weren't really dying,
he wouldn't have sent for us.

68
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,738
Maybe he just misses us.

69
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:25,514
The senators? He wouldn't
have summoned them if...

70
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:26,748
Peace, Commodus.

71
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:30,883
After two weeks on the road, your
incessant scheming is hurting my head.

72
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:41,725
He's made his decision.
He's going to announce it.

73
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,263
He will name me.

74
00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:53,775
The first thing I shall do when...

75
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,885
is honor him with games
worthy of His Majesty.

76
00:13:59,956 --> 00:14:04,780
For now, the first thing I
shall do is have a hot bath.

77
00:14:06,562 --> 00:14:08,291
Your Highness?

78
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,194
We seem to be almost there, sir.

79
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,469
- Sire.
- Where's the Emperor?

80
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:25,741
He's at the front, sire.
They've been gone for 19 days.

81
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,512
The wounded are still coming in.

82
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,245
My horse.

83
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,981
My lord.

84
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:36,617
A kiss?

85
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,987
You have proved your
valor yet again, Maximus.

86
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:20,964
Let us hope for the last time.

87
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,669
There's no one left to fight, sire.

88
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,231
There is always someone left to fight.

89
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:29,365
How can I reward Rome's greatest general?

90
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,341
Let me go home.

91
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:40,182
Home.

92
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:00,533
They honor you, Caesar.

93
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,408
It's for you, Maximus. They honor you.

94
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,098
Have I missed it? Have I missed the battle?

95
00:16:30,773 --> 00:16:32,570
You have missed the war.

96
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:34,872
Father, congratulations.

97
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:37,734
I shall sacrifice a hundred
bulls to honor your triumph.

98
00:16:37,814 --> 00:16:39,475
Save the bulls.

99
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,073
Honor Maximus. He won the battle.

100
00:16:42,452 --> 00:16:44,784
- General.
- Highness.

101
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:49,417
Rome salutes you, and I
embrace you as a brother.

102
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:51,289
It has been too long, my old friend.

103
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:52,759
Highness.

104
00:16:52,895 --> 00:16:55,455
Here, Father. Take my arm.

105
00:16:57,066 --> 00:17:00,263
I think it is time for me to leave.

106
00:17:15,418 --> 00:17:18,739
So much for the glory of Rome.

107
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,567
Magnificent battle.

108
00:19:01,218 --> 00:19:04,551
Three of our legions against
four thousand of them.

109
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:15,226
Still alive?

110
00:19:15,332 --> 00:19:18,324
- Still alive.
- The gods must have a sense of humor.

111
00:19:18,402 --> 00:19:21,064
- The gods must love you.
- Valerius.

112
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:23,936
Back to barracks, General? Or to Rome?

113
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:27,203
Home. My wife, the son, the harvest.

114
00:19:27,845 --> 00:19:31,178
Maximus the farmer. I still
have difficulty imagining that.

115
00:19:31,248 --> 00:19:34,843
You know, dirt cleans off a
lot easier than blood, Quintus.

116
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,046
- Here he is.
- Highness.

117
00:19:37,121 --> 00:19:38,952
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

118
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,314
Beware of Gaius. He'll pour
a honeyed potion in your ear,

119
00:19:42,393 --> 00:19:45,920
and you'll wake up one day, and all
you'll say is, "Republic, republic."

120
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,692
Well, why not? Rome was
founded as a republic.

121
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:51,394
Yes, and in a republic,
the Senate has the power.

122
00:19:51,469 --> 00:19:53,960
Senator Gaius isn't influenced
by that, of course.

123
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:56,699
Where do you stand,
General? Emperor or senate?

124
00:19:56,774 --> 00:20:01,598
The soldier has the advantage of being able
to look his enemy in the eye, Senator.

125
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:05,937
Well, with an army behind you,
you could be extremely political.

126
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:09,110
I warned you. Now I shall save you. Senators.

127
00:20:18,996 --> 00:20:20,429
Maximus.

128
00:20:21,565 --> 00:20:23,988
I'm going to need good men like you.

129
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:28,662
How may I be of service, Highness?

130
00:20:28,772 --> 00:20:31,400
You're a man who knows what it is to command.

131
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:35,174
You give your orders, the orders
are obeyed and the battle is won.

132
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:40,069
But these senators scheme and
squabble and flatter and deceive.

133
00:20:40,618 --> 00:20:43,576
We must save Rome from the
politicians, my friend.

134
00:20:43,654 --> 00:20:46,748
Can I count on you, when the time comes?

135
00:20:52,596 --> 00:20:55,622
Highness, when your father releases
me, I intend to return home.

136
00:20:55,699 --> 00:20:58,930
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.

137
00:21:00,437 --> 00:21:04,203
Don't get too comfortable. I
may call on you before long.

138
00:21:06,277 --> 00:21:08,837
Lucilla's here. Did you know?

139
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,302
She's not forgotten you.

140
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:14,709
And now you're the great man.

141
00:21:27,231 --> 00:21:29,722
If only you had been born a man.

142
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:33,064
What a Caesar you would have made.

143
00:21:34,738 --> 00:21:36,228
Father.

144
00:21:42,046 --> 00:21:44,037
You would have been strong.

145
00:21:44,148 --> 00:21:47,345
I wonder, would you have been just?

146
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:50,913
I would have been what you taught me to be.

147
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,414
How was your journey?

148
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:58,689
Long. Uncomfortable. Why have I come?

149
00:21:58,862 --> 00:22:01,490
I need your help. With your brother.

150
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:03,623
Of course.

151
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:05,862
He loves you. He always has.

152
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,030
And...

153
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,103
he will need you now, more than ever.

154
00:22:18,182 --> 00:22:20,047
Enough of politics.

155
00:22:20,384 --> 00:22:23,376
Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter

156
00:22:23,787 --> 00:22:26,176
and I am a good father.

157
00:22:31,762 --> 00:22:34,526
This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?

158
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:48,901
Good morning, General.

159
00:23:02,092 --> 00:23:04,583
I need three warhorses.

160
00:23:14,838 --> 00:23:16,829
Two. Three.

161
00:23:17,508 --> 00:23:18,770
Four.

162
00:23:18,842 --> 00:23:21,504
One. Two.

163
00:23:37,328 --> 00:23:39,284
You sent for me, Caesar?

164
00:23:44,101 --> 00:23:46,934
- Caesar?
- Tell me again, Maximus.

165
00:23:48,005 --> 00:23:49,700
Why are we here?

166
00:23:51,008 --> 00:23:53,533
For the glory of the Empire, sire.

167
00:23:54,011 --> 00:23:55,103
Ah, yes.

168
00:23:57,114 --> 00:23:59,105
Ah, yes, I remember.

169
00:24:02,152 --> 00:24:04,382
Do you see that map, Maximus?

170
00:24:05,189 --> 00:24:07,714
That is the world which I created.

171
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:10,183
For 25 years,

172
00:24:10,794 --> 00:24:14,651
I have conquered, spilt
blood, expanded the Empire.

173
00:24:16,033 --> 00:24:19,855
Since I became Caesar, I've
known four years without war.

174
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,393
Four years of peace in 20.

175
00:24:22,706 --> 00:24:24,196
And for what?

176
00:24:31,648 --> 00:24:35,414
I brought the sword. Nothing more.

177
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,017
Caesar, your life...

178
00:24:38,088 --> 00:24:40,682
Please. Please don't call me that.

179
00:24:40,924 --> 00:24:43,222
Come. Please.

180
00:24:44,027 --> 00:24:45,392
Come sit.

181
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,926
Let us talk together now,

182
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,926
very simply, as men.

183
00:24:52,603 --> 00:24:54,434
Well, Maximus?

184
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,000
Talk.

185
00:25:00,944 --> 00:25:03,833
5,000 of my men are out
there in the freezing mud.

186
00:25:04,047 --> 00:25:07,539
3,000 are bloodied and cleaved.
2,000 will never leave this place.

187
00:25:07,618 --> 00:25:10,678
I will not believe that they
fought and died for nothing.

188
00:25:10,754 --> 00:25:12,381
And what would you believe...

189
00:25:12,456 --> 00:25:16,278
They fought for you. And for Rome.

190
00:25:16,393 --> 00:25:18,190
And what is Rome, Maximus?

191
00:25:20,364 --> 00:25:22,753
I've seen much of the rest of the world.

192
00:25:22,866 --> 00:25:26,859
It is brutal and cruel and
dark. Rome is the light.

193
00:25:26,937 --> 00:25:28,859
Yet you have never been there.

194
00:25:28,939 --> 00:25:31,362
You have not seen what it has become.

195
00:25:31,475 --> 00:25:34,535
I am dying, Maximus.

196
00:25:35,212 --> 00:25:36,873
When a man sees his end,

197
00:25:36,947 --> 00:25:40,041
he wants to know there was
some purpose to his life.

198
00:25:40,717 --> 00:25:43,811
How will the world speak
my name in years to come?

199
00:25:43,954 --> 00:25:46,252
Will I be known as the philosopher?

200
00:25:46,323 --> 00:25:47,813
The warrior?

201
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:49,558
The tyrant?

202
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:55,591
Or will I be the emperor who
gave Rome back her true self?

203
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:58,965
There was once a dream that was Rome.

204
00:25:59,069 --> 00:26:01,902
You could only whisper it.

205
00:26:01,972 --> 00:26:05,135
Anything more than a
whisper and it would vanish.

206
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:06,971
It was so fragile.

207
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:11,008
And I fear that it will
not survive the winter.

208
00:26:12,516 --> 00:26:13,915
Maximus.

209
00:26:14,918 --> 00:26:17,807
Let us whisper now.

210
00:26:18,088 --> 00:26:19,817
Together, you and I.

211
00:26:20,524 --> 00:26:22,014
You have a son.

212
00:26:23,594 --> 00:26:25,425
Tell me about your home.

213
00:26:31,635 --> 00:26:34,490
My house is in the hills above Tiujillo.

214
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:37,668
A very simple place.

215
00:26:38,108 --> 00:26:41,032
Pink stones that warm in the sun.

216
00:26:41,144 --> 00:26:44,602
A kitchen garden that
smells of herbs in the day,

217
00:26:45,349 --> 00:26:47,271
jasmine in the evening.

218
00:26:48,952 --> 00:26:51,512
Through the gate is a giant poplar.

219
00:26:51,822 --> 00:26:54,655
Figs, apples, pears.

220
00:26:54,758 --> 00:26:58,615
The soil, Marcus... black.
Black like my wife's hair.

221
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,791
Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.

222
00:27:01,865 --> 00:27:04,129
Wild ponies play near my house. My son,

223
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:05,828
he wants to be one of them.

224
00:27:05,936 --> 00:27:07,767
When was the last time you were home?

225
00:27:07,838 --> 00:27:10,932
Two years, 264 days, and this morning.

226
00:27:12,543 --> 00:27:15,842
I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home.

227
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:19,277
Worth fighting for.

228
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:24,212
There is one more duty

229
00:27:24,788 --> 00:27:27,518
that I ask of you before you go home.

230
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:31,552
What would you have me do, Caesar?

231
00:27:31,662 --> 00:27:35,291
I want you to become the
protector of Rome after I die.

232
00:27:36,466 --> 00:27:39,458
I will empower you to one end alone.

233
00:27:40,003 --> 00:27:43,495
To give power back to the people of Rome,

234
00:27:43,807 --> 00:27:46,867
and end the corruption that has crippled it.

235
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,813
Well, do you accept this great
honor that I have offered you?

236
00:27:58,255 --> 00:28:00,177
With all my heart, no.

237
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:04,388
Maximus.

238
00:28:04,995 --> 00:28:07,884
That is why it must be you.

239
00:28:07,998 --> 00:28:10,057
But surely a prefect, a senator,

240
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:12,727
somebody who knows the city,
understands her politics.

241
00:28:12,803 --> 00:28:15,795
But you have not been
corrupted by her politics.

242
00:28:20,944 --> 00:28:24,573
- And Commodus?
- Commodus is not a moral man.

243
00:28:25,449 --> 00:28:28,009
You have known that since you were young.

244
00:28:28,218 --> 00:28:30,174
Commodus cannot rule.

245
00:28:30,253 --> 00:28:32,619
He must not rule.

246
00:28:34,191 --> 00:28:36,955
You are the son that I should have had.

247
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:42,521
Commodus will accept my decision.

248
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:49,456
He knows that you command
the loyalty of the army.

249
00:28:54,444 --> 00:28:56,036
I need some time, sire.

250
00:28:56,113 --> 00:28:57,603
Yes.

251
00:28:57,648 --> 00:29:01,243
By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.

252
00:29:02,285 --> 00:29:04,446
Now embrace me as my son.

253
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:10,587
And bring an old man another blanket.

254
00:29:26,843 --> 00:29:29,334
- My father favors you now.
- My lady.

255
00:29:29,913 --> 00:29:32,939
- It was not always so.
- Many things change.

256
00:29:33,183 --> 00:29:36,346
Many things. Not everything.

257
00:29:39,289 --> 00:29:40,950
Maximus, stop.

258
00:29:44,494 --> 00:29:46,416
Let me see your face.

259
00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:51,661
- You seem upset.
- I lost many men.

260
00:29:52,602 --> 00:29:54,934
What did my father want with you?

261
00:29:56,006 --> 00:29:58,964
To wish me well before I leave for home.

262
00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:01,133
You're lying.

263
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:04,806
I could always tell when you were
lying. You were never any good at it.

264
00:30:04,881 --> 00:30:07,441
- I never acquired your comfort with it.
- True.

265
00:30:07,517 --> 00:30:09,644
But then you never had to.

266
00:30:10,153 --> 00:30:12,849
Life is more simple for a soldier.

267
00:30:14,658 --> 00:30:16,853
Or do you think me heartless?

268
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:20,625
I think you have a talent for survival.

269
00:30:26,636 --> 00:30:28,160
Maximus, stop.

270
00:30:30,507 --> 00:30:32,998
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?

271
00:30:33,343 --> 00:30:35,834
No. I'm tired from battle.

272
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,244
It hurts you to see my father so fragile.

273
00:30:42,385 --> 00:30:46,481
Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.

274
00:30:47,991 --> 00:30:51,381
Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?

275
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,691
I will always serve Rome.

276
00:30:57,601 --> 00:30:59,432
Do you know,

277
00:30:59,536 --> 00:31:02,027
I still remember you in my prayers.

278
00:31:03,073 --> 00:31:05,928
Oh, yes. I pray.

279
00:31:10,547 --> 00:31:13,846
I was sad to hear of your
husband's death. I mourned him.

280
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:18,552
- Thank you.
- And I hear you have a son.

281
00:31:20,223 --> 00:31:22,612
Yes. Lucius.

282
00:31:24,294 --> 00:31:26,216
He'll be nearly eight years old.

283
00:31:26,296 --> 00:31:28,560
My son is also nearly eight.

284
00:31:31,368 --> 00:31:33,529
I thank you for your prayers.

285
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:43,803
Ancestors, I ask for your guidance.

286
00:31:45,215 --> 00:31:48,742
Blessed Mother, come to me with
the gods' desire for my future.

287
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,108
Blessed Father, watch over my
wife and son with a ready sword.

288
00:31:55,325 --> 00:31:58,158
Whisper to them I live
only to hold them again.

289
00:31:59,329 --> 00:32:01,490
Ancestors, I honor you.

290
00:32:02,732 --> 00:32:05,997
I will try to live with the
dignity you have taught me.

291
00:32:28,925 --> 00:32:30,119
Cicero.

292
00:32:34,698 --> 00:32:35,824
Sir.

293
00:32:40,303 --> 00:32:42,828
You don't find it hard to do your duty?

294
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:48,169
Sometimes I do what I want to do.

295
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:51,677
The rest of the time, I do what I have to.

296
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:57,340
We may not be able to go home after all.

297
00:33:48,435 --> 00:33:51,233
Are you ready to do your duty for Rome?

298
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:55,773
Yes, Father.

299
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,003
You will not be Emperor.

300
00:34:02,216 --> 00:34:04,707
Which wiser, older man is to take my place?

301
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,276
My powers will pass to Maximus,

302
00:34:08,522 --> 00:34:10,251
to hold in trust

303
00:34:10,357 --> 00:34:14,088
until the Senate is ready to rule once more.

304
00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:19,087
Rome is to be a republic again.

305
00:34:21,034 --> 00:34:23,594
- Maximus.
- Yes.

306
00:34:29,743 --> 00:34:31,938
My decision disappoints you?

307
00:34:35,515 --> 00:34:37,540
You wrote to me once,

308
00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:41,842
listing the four chief virtues.

309
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,887
Wisdom,

310
00:34:45,058 --> 00:34:46,423
justice,

311
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:48,117
fortitude,

312
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:50,259
and temperance.

313
00:34:52,432 --> 00:34:55,560
As I read the list, I
knew I had none of them.

314
00:34:56,536 --> 00:34:58,959
But I have other virtues, Father.

315
00:35:00,207 --> 00:35:01,538
Ambition.

316
00:35:02,743 --> 00:35:05,735
That can be a virtue when
it drives us to excel.

317
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,140
Resourcefulness. Courage.

318
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:15,540
Perhaps not on the battlefield, but
there are many forms of courage.

319
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:20,422
Devotion. To my family.

320
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:22,926
To you.

321
00:35:24,431 --> 00:35:27,229
But none of my virtues were on your list.

322
00:35:29,469 --> 00:35:32,632
Even then it was as if you
didn't want me for your son.

323
00:35:32,906 --> 00:35:34,237
Commodus.

324
00:35:35,142 --> 00:35:36,803
You go too far.

325
00:35:37,611 --> 00:35:40,603
I searched the faces of the gods

326
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:45,739
for ways to please you, to make you proud.

327
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,611
One kind word,

328
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,910
one full hug,

329
00:35:51,124 --> 00:35:54,787
where you pressed me to your
chest and held me tight,

330
00:35:55,929 --> 00:35:59,456
would have been like the sun on
my heart for a thousand years.

331
00:36:02,135 --> 00:36:04,660
What is it in me you hate so much?

332
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:05,998
Shh, Commodus.

333
00:36:07,107 --> 00:36:09,200
All I've ever wanted

334
00:36:09,476 --> 00:36:13,708
was to live up to you, Caesar.

335
00:36:15,015 --> 00:36:17,609
- Father.
- Commodus.

336
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:24,182
Your faults as a son

337
00:36:25,158 --> 00:36:28,457
is my failure as a father.

338
00:36:39,206 --> 00:36:40,696
Come.

339
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:45,734
Father.

340
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:03,324
I would butcher the whole world

341
00:37:04,231 --> 00:37:06,722
if you would only love me.

342
00:37:44,204 --> 00:37:47,264
Maximus, the Emperor needs you. It's urgent.

343
00:37:52,913 --> 00:37:54,744
Lament with me, brother.

344
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:57,772
Our great father is dead.

345
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,103
How did he die?

346
00:38:27,414 --> 00:38:29,974
The surgeons say there was no pain.

347
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:32,276
His breath gave out as he slept.

348
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,290
Father.

349
00:38:45,966 --> 00:38:48,594
Your emperor asks for your loyalty, Maximus.

350
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,597
Take my hand.

351
00:38:54,307 --> 00:38:56,138
I only offer it once.

352
00:39:10,323 --> 00:39:11,654
Quintus.

353
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:03,399
Hail, Caesar.

354
00:40:04,344 --> 00:40:06,938
I must talk to the senators.
I need their counsel.

355
00:40:07,047 --> 00:40:09,607
- Wake Gaius and Falco.
- Gaius and Falco.

356
00:40:09,716 --> 00:40:11,946
- Sword.
- Sword.

357
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:17,343
Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.

358
00:40:17,424 --> 00:40:20,450
Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.

359
00:40:20,694 --> 00:40:23,185
The Emperor died of natural causes.

360
00:40:24,931 --> 00:40:27,195
- Why are you armed, Quintus?
- Guards.

361
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:32,600
Please don't fight, Maximus.

362
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,605
I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.

363
00:40:37,077 --> 00:40:38,874
Ride until dawn

364
00:40:40,113 --> 00:40:41,637
and then execute him.

365
00:40:41,748 --> 00:40:44,137
Quintus, look at me. Look at me.

366
00:40:44,451 --> 00:40:47,306
Promise me that you will
look after my family.

367
00:40:48,455 --> 00:40:51,117
Your family will meet you in the afterlife.

368
00:41:15,982 --> 00:41:17,176
Kneel.

369
00:41:20,754 --> 00:41:23,120
Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son.

370
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,249
Whisper to them that I live
only to hold them again.

371
00:41:28,928 --> 00:41:31,294
At least give me a clean death.

372
00:41:32,999 --> 00:41:34,796
A soldier's death.

373
00:41:56,122 --> 00:41:59,285
The frost. Sometimes it
makes the blade stick.

374
00:42:19,913 --> 00:42:21,346
Praetorian.

375
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:42,950
When was the last time you were home?

376
00:43:43,062 --> 00:43:46,122
Two years, 264 days, and this morning.

377
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:49,589
Blessed Father, watch over my
wife and son with a ready sword.

378
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:52,001
I will try to live with the
dignity you have taught me.

379
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:54,494
Whisper to them I live
only to hold them again.

380
00:43:54,607 --> 00:43:57,132
For all else is dust and air.

381
00:43:57,243 --> 00:44:00,269
Whisper to them I live
only to hold them again.

382
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,644
For all else is dust and air.

383
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,900

384
00:47:49,008 --> 00:47:50,498
Don't die.

385
00:47:56,816 --> 00:47:58,477
You'll meet them again.

386
00:48:00,553 --> 00:48:01,815
Not yet.

387
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:14,161
No. They will clean it. Wait and see.

388
00:48:48,534 --> 00:48:49,933
Don't die.

389
00:48:50,703 --> 00:48:53,092
They'll feed you to the lions.

390
00:48:53,206 --> 00:48:55,470
They are worth more than we are.

391
00:49:05,485 --> 00:49:06,975
Better now?

392
00:49:08,087 --> 00:49:09,975
Clean. You see?

393
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:24,559

394
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,519
Proximo. My old friend.

395
00:49:44,924 --> 00:49:47,984
Every day is a great day when you are here.

396
00:49:48,427 --> 00:49:52,625
Today is your most fortunate day.

397
00:49:55,268 --> 00:49:58,999
- Those giraffes you sold me, they won't mate.
- What?

398
00:49:59,605 --> 00:50:03,496
They just walk around eating and not mating.

399
00:50:04,811 --> 00:50:07,700
You sold me queer giraffes.

400
00:50:08,614 --> 00:50:11,310
- I want my money back.
- Not a chance.

401
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:17,720
- I do special price for you.
- On what?

402
00:50:19,826 --> 00:50:22,715
Have you seen my new
stock? Come and see them.

403
00:50:36,676 --> 00:50:39,474
Do any of them fight? I've
got a match coming up.

404
00:50:39,545 --> 00:50:42,207
Some are good for fighting, others for dying.

405
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:44,747
You need both, I think.

406
00:50:44,851 --> 00:50:46,045
Get up.

407
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,721
What's your trade?

408
00:50:56,362 --> 00:50:57,659
I was a hunter.

409
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:01,427
Oh, no. I bought him from
a salt mine in Carthage.

410
00:51:02,235 --> 00:51:03,600
Sit down.

411
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:08,832
Mark of the legion.

412
00:51:08,908 --> 00:51:09,932

413
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:12,772
- Deserter.
- Maybe so. But who cares?

414
00:51:13,246 --> 00:51:14,338
He's a Spaniard.

415
00:51:14,413 --> 00:51:16,369
I'll take six. for 1,000.

416
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:20,010
1,000? The Numidian alone is worth 2,000.

417
00:51:20,086 --> 00:51:22,111
These slaves are rotten.

418
00:51:22,221 --> 00:51:23,584
It all adds to the flavor.

419
00:51:23,822 --> 00:51:25,590
No. No, no, no. Wait. Wait.

420
00:51:25,925 --> 00:51:27,620
We can negotiate.

421
00:51:28,728 --> 00:51:32,789
I'll give you 2,000. And four for the beasts.

422
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,126
That's 5,000 for an old friend.

423
00:51:52,752 --> 00:51:55,949
Come on. How long does it take
to get into my own house?

424
00:51:56,255 --> 00:51:58,143
I am Proximo.

425
00:51:58,724 --> 00:52:01,420
I shall be closer to you
for the next few days,

426
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:03,724
which will be last of your miserable lives,

427
00:52:03,796 --> 00:52:07,755
than that bitch of a mother that
brought you screaming into this world.

428
00:52:08,467 --> 00:52:11,800
I did not pay good money
for you for your company.

429
00:52:12,972 --> 00:52:16,169
I paid it so that I could
profit from your death.

430
00:52:16,943 --> 00:52:20,674
And as your mother was
there at your beginning,

431
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:24,309
so I shall be there at your end.

432
00:52:25,818 --> 00:52:28,810
And when you die, and die you shall,

433
00:52:29,755 --> 00:52:32,679
your transition shall be to the sound of...

434
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:38,853
Gladiators,

435
00:52:39,999 --> 00:52:41,489
I salute you.

436
00:52:46,272 --> 00:52:47,296
Red.

437
00:52:50,977 --> 00:52:52,308
Yellow.

438
00:52:53,446 --> 00:52:54,708
Yellow.

439
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:06,550
Good.

440
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,520
- Red.
- Red.

441
00:53:13,666 --> 00:53:14,963
Spaniard.

442
00:53:48,334 --> 00:53:50,666
That's enough for the moment.

443
00:53:51,003 --> 00:53:52,595
His time will come.

444
00:53:56,208 --> 00:53:57,384
Next.

445
00:54:10,084 --> 00:54:11,381
Spaniard,

446
00:54:12,853 --> 00:54:14,684
why don't you fight?

447
00:54:15,056 --> 00:54:16,546
We all have to fight.

448
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,285
I don't fight.

449
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,191
I shouldn't be here. I'm a
scribe, I write down words.

450
00:54:22,263 --> 00:54:24,185
I can speak seven languages.

451
00:54:24,265 --> 00:54:25,289
Good.

452
00:54:26,233 --> 00:54:29,259
Tomorrow, you can scream in seven languages.

453
00:54:37,545 --> 00:54:40,878
Perhaps the scribe will be
the one who wins his freedom.

454
00:54:41,882 --> 00:54:43,144
Freedom?

455
00:54:44,285 --> 00:54:46,082
What do I have to do?

456
00:54:46,487 --> 00:54:48,785
You go in the arena and you kill me.

457
00:54:48,889 --> 00:54:50,288
And him.

458
00:54:51,258 --> 00:54:52,782
And the Numidian,

459
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,618
and the deserter.

460
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:57,720
And a hundred more.

461
00:54:57,798 --> 00:55:00,596
And when there's no more
to fight, you're free.

462
00:55:01,235 --> 00:55:02,998
I can't do that.

463
00:55:04,071 --> 00:55:05,265

464
00:55:11,512 --> 00:55:12,945
But I can.

465
00:55:28,462 --> 00:55:30,657
Is that the sign of your gods?

466
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:37,963
Will that not anger them?

467
00:55:59,291 --> 00:56:00,952
The gods favor you.

468
00:56:01,293 --> 00:56:03,488
Red is the gods' color.

469
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,058
You will need their help today.

470
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,995

471
00:56:53,377 --> 00:56:55,538
Still leading with the German?

472
00:56:55,613 --> 00:56:57,740
The crowd love a barbarian.

473
00:56:58,182 --> 00:57:00,070
Besides that, he's making me rich.

474
00:57:00,184 --> 00:57:02,778
Has that Numidian fought before?

475
00:57:03,621 --> 00:57:05,213
No, first time.

476
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:08,247
And that one? Laborer? Soldier?

477
00:57:08,692 --> 00:57:13,049
He's a Spaniard. He might as well be a
eunuch for what he brings to the ring.

478
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:18,262
500 sesterti the Numidian and
Spaniard team makes it through.

479
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:22,066
And 1,000 that the Numidian
makes it through alone.

480
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:26,701
Are you asking me to bet against my own man?

481
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:29,910
It's unethical.

482
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:31,979
What if I make it 2,000?

483
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:49,322
Some of you are thinking you won't fight.

484
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,625
Some that you can't fight.

485
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:56,895
Some that you can't fight. They all
say that, until they're out there.

486
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:00,804
Listen.

487
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:04,274
Kill. Kill. Kill.

488
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:13,584
Thrust this into another man's flesh,

489
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:16,653
and then they will applaud
and love you for that.

490
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,159

491
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,086
You may begin to love them

492
00:58:22,933 --> 00:58:24,332
for that.

493
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:32,031
Ultimately, we're all dead men.

494
00:58:34,478 --> 00:58:36,776
Sadly, we cannot choose how,

495
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:40,679
but we can decide how we meet that end,

496
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:44,209
in order that we are remembered

497
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,384
as men.

498
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:48,515

499
00:58:51,495 --> 00:58:53,793
On the left, draw your shields.

500
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:57,221
On the right, draw your swords.

501
00:58:57,901 --> 00:58:59,960
Kill, kill, kill...

502
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:03,560
Pair them up, red with yellow.

503
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:09,805
Next.

504
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:16,811

505
01:02:34,184 --> 01:02:35,208

506
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:36,343

507
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:00,604
Go away.

508
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:35,673
He enters Rome like a conquering
hero, but what has he conquered?

509
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:38,243
Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.

510
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:40,643
I think he could do very well.

511
01:03:41,118 --> 01:03:43,074
For Rome or for you?

512
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:52,419
Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.

513
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:00,926
- Lucius.
- Mother.

514
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,664
Hail, Caesar.

515
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:06,365
Senators.

516
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:12,935
Rome greets her new emperor.

517
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:16,543
Your loyal subjects bid
you welcome, Highness.

518
01:04:16,653 --> 01:04:18,518
Thank you, Falco.

519
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:22,649
And for the loyal subjects. I
trust they weren't too expensive.

520
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:24,785
- Caesar.
- Gracchus.

521
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,352
Rome rejoices in your return, Caesar.

522
01:04:27,397 --> 01:04:30,628
There are many matters that
require your attention.

523
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:36,236
To order. To order.

524
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:41,370
For your guidance, Caesar, the Senate
has prepared a series of protocols

525
01:04:41,478 --> 01:04:44,538
to begin addressing the
many problems in the city.

526
01:04:44,648 --> 01:04:48,709
Beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek quarter,

527
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:52,551
to combat the plague which is
already springing up there.

528
01:04:52,923 --> 01:04:54,720
So, if Caesar...

529
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:58,748
Don't you see, Gracchus?

530
01:05:00,163 --> 01:05:02,495
That's the very problem, isn't it?

531
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,561
My father spent all his time at study.

532
01:05:07,337 --> 01:05:10,693
At books and learning and philosophy.

533
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:15,166
He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the Senate.

534
01:05:16,179 --> 01:05:19,342
And all the while, the people were forgotten.

535
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:22,177
But the Senate is the people, sire.

536
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:25,779
Chosen from among the people,
to speak for the people.

537
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:30,018
I doubt many of the people eat
so well as you do, Gracchus.

538
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,351
Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.

539
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:35,557
I think I understand my own people.

540
01:05:35,632 --> 01:05:39,124
Then, perhaps Caesar will
be so good as to teach us.

541
01:05:39,469 --> 01:05:42,097
Out of his own extensive experience.

542
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:47,600
I call it love.

543
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:51,239
I am their father. The
people are my children.

544
01:05:51,548 --> 01:05:54,142
I shall hold them to my
bosom and embrace them.

545
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:57,311
Have you ever embraced
someone dying of plague, sire?

546
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:06,487
No, but if you interrupt me again,

547
01:06:07,998 --> 01:06:09,329
I assure you that you shall.

548
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:11,764
Senator, my brother is very tired.

549
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:16,933
Leave your list with me, Caesar
shall do all that Rome requires.

550
01:06:17,507 --> 01:06:22,433
My lady, as always, your lightest
touch commands obedience.

551
01:06:29,586 --> 01:06:31,850
Who are they to lecture me?

552
01:06:32,122 --> 01:06:34,647
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

553
01:06:34,758 --> 01:06:37,647
What uses? All they do is talk.

554
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:43,424
It should be just you and me, and Rome.

555
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,799
Don't even think it. There's
always been a Senate.

556
01:06:47,304 --> 01:06:48,965
Rome has changed.

557
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:52,099
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.

558
01:06:52,442 --> 01:06:55,468
- Of course, but leave the people their...
- Illusions?

559
01:06:57,547 --> 01:06:58,980
Traditions.

560
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,647
My father's war against the barbarians...

561
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:06,848
He said it himself, it achieved
nothing, but the people loved him.

562
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,844
The people always love victories.

563
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:12,621
Why? They didn't see the battles.

564
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:15,954
What do they care about Germania?

565
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,330
They care about the greatness of Rome.

566
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:20,323
The greatness of Rome.

567
01:07:22,305 --> 01:07:24,068
Well, what is that?

568
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:30,041
It's an idea. Greatness.

569
01:07:33,817 --> 01:07:37,207
- Greatness is a vision.
- Exactly. A vision.

570
01:07:39,322 --> 01:07:41,210
Do you not see, Lucilla?

571
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:46,551
I will give the people a vision of
Rome, and they'll love me for it.

572
01:07:47,197 --> 01:07:51,588
And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry, old men.

573
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:06,345
I will give the people the
greatest vision of their lives.

574
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:48,882

575
01:08:57,567 --> 01:09:00,456
White and red wine for
your drinking pleasure.

576
01:09:08,745 --> 01:09:09,939
Games.

577
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:15,308
150 days of games.

578
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:17,412
He's cleverer than I thought.

579
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:21,014
Clever. The whole of Rome
would be laughing at him,

580
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:24,021
if they weren't so afraid of his Praetorians.

581
01:09:24,127 --> 01:09:26,925
Fear and wonder, a powerful combination.

582
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:31,459
You really think the people are
going to be seduced by that?

583
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:34,628
I think he knows what
Rome is. Rome is the mob.

584
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:38,466
He'll conjure magic for them,
and they'll be distracted.

585
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:42,307
He'll take away their freedom
and still they'll roar.

586
01:09:42,879 --> 01:09:47,270
The beating heart of Rome is
not the marble of the Senate.

587
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,375
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

588
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:53,346
He'll bring them death,

589
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:57,490
And they will love him for it.

590
01:10:01,828 --> 01:10:04,319
Spaniard.

591
01:10:20,214 --> 01:10:22,239
All you do is kill, kill, kill.

592
01:10:22,349 --> 01:10:24,738
The crowd don't want a
butcher, they want a hero.

593
01:10:24,852 --> 01:10:26,877
You want them to keep coming back,

594
01:10:26,987 --> 01:10:31,151
so don't just hack them to pieces.
Remember, you are an entertainer.

595
01:10:33,761 --> 01:10:35,092
Spaniard.

596
01:10:42,936 --> 01:10:44,426
So entertain.

597
01:11:49,485 --> 01:11:53,581
Are you not entertained?

598
01:11:55,892 --> 01:11:58,156
Is this not why you are here?

599
01:12:02,765 --> 01:12:05,154
Spaniard.

600
01:12:23,052 --> 01:12:24,781
What do you want?

601
01:12:27,357 --> 01:12:28,517
Girl?

602
01:12:29,592 --> 01:12:30,718
Boy?

603
01:12:31,628 --> 01:12:33,892
- You sent for me?
- Yes, I did.

604
01:12:34,964 --> 01:12:38,058
You're good, Spaniard, but
you're not that good.

605
01:12:38,134 --> 01:12:39,362
You could be magnificent.

606
01:12:39,435 --> 01:12:42,893
I'm required to kill, so
I kill. That is enough.

607
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:46,800
That's enough for the
provinces, but not for Rome.

608
01:12:50,213 --> 01:12:54,104
The young emperor has arranged
a series of spectacles

609
01:12:54,217 --> 01:12:58,381
to commemorate his father, Marcus Aurelius.

610
01:12:58,922 --> 01:13:00,878
I find that amusing,

611
01:13:01,224 --> 01:13:04,284
since it was Marcus Aurelius,

612
01:13:04,394 --> 01:13:07,818
the wise, the all-knowing Marcus
Aurelius, that closed us down.

613
01:13:10,833 --> 01:13:14,963
So, finally, after five years
of scratching a living in

614
01:13:15,071 --> 01:13:17,266
flea-infested villages,

615
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:20,400
we're finally going back to where we belong.

616
01:13:21,144 --> 01:13:22,668
The Colosseum.

617
01:13:24,948 --> 01:13:27,746
You should see the Colosseum, Spaniard.

618
01:13:29,085 --> 01:13:31,144
50,000 Romans

619
01:13:32,088 --> 01:13:35,910
watching every movement of your sword.

620
01:13:37,327 --> 01:13:39,818
Willing you to make that killer blow.

621
01:13:40,997 --> 01:13:44,660
The silence before you strike,
and the noise afterwards,

622
01:13:45,635 --> 01:13:49,264
it rises... rises up like...

623
01:13:50,807 --> 01:13:52,399
like a storm.

624
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:55,298
As if you were the thunder god himself.

625
01:13:55,611 --> 01:13:58,603
- You were a gladiator?
- Yes, I was.

626
01:14:05,021 --> 01:14:07,114
You won your freedom?

627
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:09,679
A long time ago, the Emperor...

628
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:13,488
presented me with a rudius.

629
01:14:15,231 --> 01:14:17,062
It's just a wooden sword.

630
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:20,164
A symbol of your freedom.

631
01:14:22,338 --> 01:14:25,364
He touched me on the
shoulder, and I was free.

632
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:29,132
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

633
01:14:29,212 --> 01:14:33,034
I did not say I knew him. I said he
touched me on the shoulder once.

634
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:36,176
You asked me what I want.

635
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,478
I, too, want to stand in
front of the Emperor.

636
01:14:41,724 --> 01:14:43,157
As you did.

637
01:14:43,226 --> 01:14:46,650
Then listen to me. Learn from me.

638
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:50,590
I wasn't the best because I killed quickly.

639
01:14:51,768 --> 01:14:54,430
I was the best because the crowd loved me.

640
01:14:55,571 --> 01:14:58,870
Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom.

641
01:15:03,346 --> 01:15:05,211
I will win the crowd.

642
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:10,510
I will give them something
they have never seen before.

643
01:15:11,921 --> 01:15:14,947
So, Spaniard, we shall go to Rome together

644
01:15:15,591 --> 01:15:17,388
and have bloody adventures.

645
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:19,257
And the great whore will suckle us

646
01:15:19,362 --> 01:15:21,922
until we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more.

647
01:15:22,031 --> 01:15:23,464
And then,

648
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,727
when enough men have died,

649
01:15:28,905 --> 01:15:31,396
perhaps you will have your freedom.

650
01:15:35,778 --> 01:15:38,144
Here. Use this.

651
01:16:01,838 --> 01:16:05,001
It's somewhere out there, my country,

652
01:16:06,109 --> 01:16:07,406
My home.

653
01:16:08,611 --> 01:16:10,738
My wife is preparing food.

654
01:16:11,747 --> 01:16:14,443
My daughters carry water from the river.

655
01:16:15,785 --> 01:16:17,810
Will I ever see them again?

656
01:16:19,088 --> 01:16:20,612
I think no.

657
01:16:20,923 --> 01:16:23,346
Do you believe you'll see
them again when you die?

658
01:16:23,459 --> 01:16:24,858
I think so.

659
01:16:25,461 --> 01:16:28,521
But then, I will die soon.

660
01:16:30,166 --> 01:16:32,657
They will not die for many years.

661
01:16:33,436 --> 01:16:35,097
I'll have to wait.

662
01:16:35,171 --> 01:16:37,366
But you would wait.

663
01:16:38,007 --> 01:16:39,338
Of course.

664
01:16:41,277 --> 01:16:42,642
You see,

665
01:16:43,813 --> 01:16:45,178
My wife

666
01:16:46,682 --> 01:16:50,607
and my son, are already waiting for me.

667
01:16:51,354 --> 01:16:53,683
You'll meet them again.

668
01:16:54,089 --> 01:16:55,552
But not yet.

669
01:16:59,061 --> 01:17:00,392
Not yet.

670
01:17:01,998 --> 01:17:03,488
- Unless...
- Not yet.

671
01:17:07,703 --> 01:17:08,727
Not yet.

672
01:17:18,547 --> 01:17:20,640
I see him.

673
01:17:22,118 --> 01:17:24,245
- Where?
- There he is.

674
01:18:12,568 --> 01:18:13,694
Out.

675
01:18:14,904 --> 01:18:16,792
Move. Out.

676
01:18:20,509 --> 01:18:22,101
Are there any others?

677
01:18:29,552 --> 01:18:32,043
Good to see you again, old friend.

678
01:18:37,393 --> 01:18:39,088
Bring me fortune.

679
01:18:43,666 --> 01:18:46,555
Have you ever seen anything like that before?

680
01:18:47,637 --> 01:18:50,231
I didn't know men could build such things.

681
01:19:00,182 --> 01:19:01,740
Win the crowd.

682
01:19:01,984 --> 01:19:04,248
Get Inside. Move.

683
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:05,682
Inside.

684
01:19:54,904 --> 01:19:57,634
He sleeps so well because he's loved.

685
01:20:00,576 --> 01:20:02,669
Come, Brother. It's late.

686
01:20:06,248 --> 01:20:09,081
I will make Rome the wonder of the ages.

687
01:20:11,887 --> 01:20:15,220
That is what Gracchus and his
friends don't understand.

688
01:20:15,658 --> 01:20:18,855
All my desires are
splitting my head to pieces.

689
01:20:25,935 --> 01:20:28,665
Commodus, drink this tonic.

690
01:20:38,247 --> 01:20:40,670
I think the time is almost right.

691
01:20:41,016 --> 01:20:43,871
I could announce the
dissolution of the Senate

692
01:20:44,053 --> 01:20:46,112
at the celebration to honor our father.

693
01:20:46,222 --> 01:20:48,178
You think I should?

694
01:20:48,924 --> 01:20:50,846
Are the people ready?

695
01:20:52,962 --> 01:20:55,351
I think you need your rest now.

696
01:21:01,303 --> 01:21:03,100
Will you stay with me?

697
01:21:03,205 --> 01:21:05,594
Still afraid of the dark, Brother?

698
01:21:12,381 --> 01:21:13,575
Still?

699
01:21:15,418 --> 01:21:16,715
Always.

700
01:21:18,421 --> 01:21:21,276
- Stay with me tonight?
- You know I won't.

701
01:21:25,877 --> 01:21:27,367
Then kiss me.

702
01:21:36,187 --> 01:21:37,745
Sleep, Brother.

703
01:22:30,542 --> 01:22:32,635
Having servants who are deaf and mute

704
01:22:32,744 --> 01:22:35,474
at least ensures I live a little longer.

705
01:22:37,282 --> 01:22:39,307
They're arresting scholars now.

706
01:22:39,717 --> 01:22:43,539
Anyone who dares speak out.
Even satirists and chroniclers.

707
01:22:44,155 --> 01:22:46,077
And mathematicians.

708
01:22:47,292 --> 01:22:49,453
And all to feed the arena.

709
01:22:51,095 --> 01:22:53,620
The Senate did not approve martial law.

710
01:22:53,731 --> 01:22:56,564
This reign of terror is
entirely the Praetorians'.

711
01:22:57,602 --> 01:22:59,729
I'm afraid to go out after dark.

712
01:22:59,804 --> 01:23:03,262
You should be more afraid of
your activities during the day.

713
01:23:03,475 --> 01:23:08,139
The Senate is full of his spies.
Led by that whoremaster, Falco.

714
01:23:09,514 --> 01:23:13,905
But what is in his mind? That's
what I trouble myself with.

715
01:23:14,686 --> 01:23:17,610
He spends all his days singularly obsessed,

716
01:23:17,689 --> 01:23:20,522
planning the festival to honor your father.

717
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:24,186
He neglects even the most
fundamental task of government.

718
01:23:24,963 --> 01:23:27,158
So just what is he planning?

719
01:23:27,532 --> 01:23:29,159
And what pays for it?

720
01:23:29,267 --> 01:23:33,465
These daily games are costing a
fortune, yet we have no new taxes.

721
01:23:34,205 --> 01:23:35,638
The future.

722
01:23:37,041 --> 01:23:39,032
The future pays for it.

723
01:23:40,512 --> 01:23:43,037
He's started selling the grain reserves.

724
01:23:43,515 --> 01:23:45,346
This can't be true.

725
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:48,441
He is selling Rome's reserves of grain.

726
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:51,944
The people will be starving in two years.

727
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:53,980
I hope they enjoy the games.

728
01:23:54,058 --> 01:23:57,448
Soon enough, they will
be dead because of them.

729
01:23:57,795 --> 01:24:00,127
- Rome must know this.
- And how?

730
01:24:00,632 --> 01:24:02,998
He's going to dissolve the Senate.

731
01:24:03,568 --> 01:24:07,129
And who will tell them before
it's too late? You, Gracchus?

732
01:24:08,506 --> 01:24:09,996
You, Gaius?

733
01:24:10,074 --> 01:24:14,067
Will you make a speech on the floor
of the Senate denouncing my brother?

734
01:24:14,178 --> 01:24:16,703
And then see your family in the Colosseum?

735
01:24:17,715 --> 01:24:19,046
Who'd dare?

736
01:24:28,226 --> 01:24:31,218
I have been living in a
prison of fear every day

737
01:24:31,329 --> 01:24:33,923
because my son is heir to the throne.

738
01:24:39,571 --> 01:24:41,061
He must die.

739
01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:49,176
Quintus and the Praetorians would
simply seize control for themselves.

740
01:24:49,247 --> 01:24:53,069
No. Cut off the head and
the snake cannot strike.

741
01:24:53,151 --> 01:24:54,982
Lucilla, Gaius is right.

742
01:24:55,353 --> 01:24:59,449
Until we can neutralize the
Praetorians, we can achieve nothing.

743
01:25:01,025 --> 01:25:02,515
So we do nothing?

744
01:25:02,594 --> 01:25:05,392
No, child. We keep our counsel.

745
01:25:06,364 --> 01:25:07,763
We prepare.

746
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:13,355
As long as the people support
him, we are voices without steel.

747
01:25:14,138 --> 01:25:15,571
We are air.

748
01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:21,374
But with every day that
passes, he makes enemies.

749
01:25:21,446 --> 01:25:24,301
One day, he'll have more
enemies than friends.

750
01:25:24,749 --> 01:25:27,707
And on that day, we will act.

751
01:25:28,286 --> 01:25:30,151
Then we will strike.

752
01:25:31,089 --> 01:25:32,818
But until then,

753
01:25:33,992 --> 01:25:35,550
we are docile.

754
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:38,221
We are obedient.

755
01:25:39,797 --> 01:25:41,788
And we are treacherous.

756
01:25:50,441 --> 01:25:51,566
Come on. Get out of the way.

757
01:25:54,311 --> 01:25:55,335
Pick me.

758
01:25:57,414 --> 01:25:59,245
I want to cover you in kisses.

759
01:26:00,451 --> 01:26:02,476
All right, that's enough.

760
01:26:25,042 --> 01:26:28,808
The emperor wants battles. I don't
want to sacrifice my best fighters.

761
01:26:28,879 --> 01:26:32,042
The crowd wants battles, so
the Emperor gives them battles.

762
01:26:32,149 --> 01:26:35,710
- And you get the battle of Carthage.
- The massacre of Carthage.

763
01:26:37,321 --> 01:26:41,178
Why not go down to the prison and
round up all the beggars and thieves?

764
01:26:41,291 --> 01:26:42,451
We've done that.

765
01:26:42,526 --> 01:26:46,155
If you want to give away the best
gladiators in the whole of the Empire,

766
01:26:46,230 --> 01:26:48,357
I want double the rates.

767
01:26:48,465 --> 01:26:52,196
You'll get your contract rates, or
you'll get your contract cancelled.

768
01:26:52,302 --> 01:26:53,735
You don't like it?

769
01:26:53,837 --> 01:26:57,796
Then you can crawl back down that
shithole that you came from.

770
01:27:00,878 --> 01:27:03,075
Cassius, please. Please, Cassius.

771
01:27:32,909 --> 01:27:35,901
Gladiator, are you the one
they call the Spaniard?

772
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:37,205
Yes.

773
01:27:38,014 --> 01:27:40,175
They said you were a giant.

774
01:27:40,283 --> 01:27:43,411
They said you could crush a
man's skull with one hand.

775
01:27:43,553 --> 01:27:45,282
A man's? No.

776
01:27:46,623 --> 01:27:47,954
A boy's.

777
01:27:49,959 --> 01:27:53,520
- They have good horses in Spain?
- Some of the best.

778
01:27:54,564 --> 01:27:57,624
This is Argento, and this is Scarto.

779
01:27:59,035 --> 01:28:00,866
They were my horses.

780
01:28:01,771 --> 01:28:03,864
They were taken from me.

781
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:07,439
I like you, Spaniard. I shall cheer for you.

782
01:28:07,977 --> 01:28:11,310
- They let you watch the games?
- My uncle says it makes me strong.

783
01:28:11,414 --> 01:28:14,713
- What does your father say?
- My father's dead.

784
01:28:16,486 --> 01:28:18,545
Master Lucius, it is time.

785
01:28:19,823 --> 01:28:21,154
I have to go.

786
01:28:21,257 --> 01:28:22,815
Your name is Lucius?

787
01:28:24,961 --> 01:28:27,623
Lucius Verus, after my father.

788
01:28:58,228 --> 01:28:59,991
Lower.

789
01:29:05,134 --> 01:29:06,499
Claudius.

790
01:29:06,836 --> 01:29:09,225
- Yes, sir?
- More shields.

791
01:29:09,339 --> 01:29:10,533

792
01:29:29,659 --> 01:29:34,392
When the Emperor enters,
raise your weapons, salute him

793
01:29:34,497 --> 01:29:36,556
and then speak together.

794
01:29:37,333 --> 01:29:40,825
Face the Emperor and don't
turn your back on him.

795
01:29:41,905 --> 01:29:44,760
Go, and die with honor.

796
01:30:39,829 --> 01:30:41,922
Hail, mighty Caesar.

797
01:30:45,134 --> 01:30:49,400

798
01:30:52,442 --> 01:30:55,400
We who are about to die salute you.

799
01:30:57,113 --> 01:30:58,671
On this day,

800
01:30:59,415 --> 01:31:02,441
we reach back to hallowed antiquity,

801
01:31:03,319 --> 01:31:06,948
to bring you a recreation of the second fall

802
01:31:07,023 --> 01:31:09,116
of mighty Carthage.

803
01:31:12,795 --> 01:31:17,186
On the barren plain of Zama,

804
01:31:17,834 --> 01:31:20,860
there stood the invincible armies

805
01:31:21,304 --> 01:31:23,932
of the barbarian, Hannibal.

806
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:27,803
Ferocious mercenaries and warriors

807
01:31:27,877 --> 01:31:30,266
from all brute nations,

808
01:31:30,346 --> 01:31:34,635
bent on merciless destruction,

809
01:31:35,518 --> 01:31:36,883
conquest.

810
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:41,847
Your Emperor is pleased to give you

811
01:31:41,958 --> 01:31:45,018
the barbarian horde.

812
01:31:53,369 --> 01:31:55,325
Anyone here been in the army?

813
01:31:55,405 --> 01:31:58,363
Yes. I served with you at Vindobona.

814
01:31:59,308 --> 01:32:00,832
You can help me.

815
01:32:02,245 --> 01:32:04,509
Whatever comes out of these gates,

816
01:32:05,548 --> 01:32:08,881
we've got a better chance of
survival if we work together.

817
01:32:09,419 --> 01:32:11,148
Do you understand?

818
01:32:13,256 --> 01:32:15,315
If we stay together, we survive.

819
01:32:15,391 --> 01:32:18,519
I'm pleased to bring you the legionnaires of

820
01:32:18,594 --> 01:32:22,189
Scipio Africanus.

821
01:32:33,009 --> 01:32:34,704
To the death.

822
01:32:38,514 --> 01:32:41,074

823
01:32:44,954 --> 01:32:46,546
Stay close.

824
01:32:52,528 --> 01:32:54,393
Come together.

825
01:32:55,731 --> 01:32:59,758
Staggered columns.

826
01:33:12,648 --> 01:33:14,445
- Soon all your men will be slain.
- You don't have a chance.

827
01:33:26,395 --> 01:33:28,920
- Lock your shields. Stay as one.
- As one.

828
01:33:30,433 --> 01:33:31,991
Hold.

829
01:33:34,137 --> 01:33:37,061
Hold. As one.

830
01:33:39,976 --> 01:33:41,307
Well done.

831
01:33:53,189 --> 01:33:57,011
Hold. Diamond.

832
01:34:02,832 --> 01:34:04,026

833
01:34:16,145 --> 01:34:17,373
Haken.

834
01:34:41,504 --> 01:34:45,031
This column to the chariots.
This column stay with me.

835
01:34:48,678 --> 01:34:50,043
Quickly.

836
01:34:50,713 --> 01:34:53,477
- Get out there.
- Hurry.

837
01:35:34,690 --> 01:35:35,884
Maximus.

838
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:50,459
Single column.

839
01:36:35,785 --> 01:36:37,184
We win.

840
01:36:42,591 --> 01:36:45,116
My history's a little hazy, Cassius.

841
01:36:45,928 --> 01:36:48,817
But shouldn't the barbarians
lose the battle of Carthage?

842
01:36:48,931 --> 01:36:50,660
Yes, sire.

843
01:36:52,635 --> 01:36:53,966
Forgive me, sire.

844
01:36:54,036 --> 01:36:56,766
No, I rather enjoy surprises.

845
01:36:57,540 --> 01:36:58,666
Who is he?

846
01:36:58,774 --> 01:37:01,766
They call him the Spaniard, sire.

847
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:06,111
I think I'll meet him.

848
01:37:06,282 --> 01:37:07,647
Yes, sire.

849
01:37:09,819 --> 01:37:11,707
Hail to the barbarians.

850
01:37:26,669 --> 01:37:30,059
Forward.

851
01:37:43,652 --> 01:37:45,313
Drop your weapons.

852
01:37:49,325 --> 01:37:52,249
Gladiator, the Emperor has asked for you.

853
01:37:52,895 --> 01:37:55,022
I'm at the Emperor's service.

854
01:38:21,791 --> 01:38:23,918
Rise.

855
01:38:33,436 --> 01:38:35,529
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard.

856
01:38:35,604 --> 01:38:38,266
I don't think there's ever
been a gladiator to match you.

857
01:38:38,374 --> 01:38:41,138
This young man insists you are Hector reborn.

858
01:38:41,243 --> 01:38:42,767
Or was it Hercules?

859
01:38:44,213 --> 01:38:47,979
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself
and tell us all your real name?

860
01:38:50,085 --> 01:38:51,712
You do have a name?

861
01:38:52,488 --> 01:38:54,376
My name is Gladiator.

862
01:38:57,660 --> 01:39:00,823
How dare you show your back to me? Slave.

863
01:39:02,164 --> 01:39:05,497
You will remove your helmet
and tell me your name.

864
01:39:17,313 --> 01:39:19,804
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius,

865
01:39:20,182 --> 01:39:22,104
commander of the armies of the north,

866
01:39:22,184 --> 01:39:24,675
general of the Felix Legions.

867
01:39:24,753 --> 01:39:28,018
Loyal servant to the true
emperor, Marcus Aurelius.

868
01:39:29,358 --> 01:39:31,519
Father to a murdered son,

869
01:39:31,994 --> 01:39:34,292
husband to a murdered wife,

870
01:39:34,663 --> 01:39:38,360
and I will have my vengeance,
in this life or the next.

871
01:39:45,374 --> 01:39:46,773
Arms.

872
01:39:59,855 --> 01:40:03,188
Live. Live. Live.

873
01:40:50,506 --> 01:40:53,202
Arms at rest.

874
01:41:45,658 --> 01:41:50,152
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

875
01:42:38,211 --> 01:42:39,439
Father.

876
01:43:53,786 --> 01:43:55,708
Why is he still alive?

877
01:43:56,923 --> 01:43:58,413
I don't know.

878
01:43:58,925 --> 01:44:00,552
He shouldn't be alive.

879
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:02,759
It vexes me.

880
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:06,293
I'm terribly vexed.

881
01:44:17,476 --> 01:44:19,432
I did what I had to do.

882
01:44:20,212 --> 01:44:24,239
If Father had had his way, the
Empire would have been torn apart.

883
01:44:24,316 --> 01:44:25,977
You do see that?

884
01:44:26,385 --> 01:44:27,545
Yes.

885
01:44:32,324 --> 01:44:35,589
What did you feel when you saw him?

886
01:44:37,663 --> 01:44:39,290
I felt nothing.

887
01:44:41,266 --> 01:44:43,791
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

888
01:44:44,836 --> 01:44:47,066
No more than I wounded him.

889
01:44:51,610 --> 01:44:53,840
They lied to me in Germania.

890
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:57,573
They told me he was dead.

891
01:44:59,585 --> 01:45:02,179
If they lie to me, they don't respect me.

892
01:45:02,287 --> 01:45:05,586
If they don't respect me,
how can they ever love me?

893
01:45:06,925 --> 01:45:09,291
Then you must let the legions know

894
01:45:09,361 --> 01:45:12,489
their treachery will not go unpunished.

895
01:45:13,332 --> 01:45:14,822
Poor sister,

896
01:45:15,167 --> 01:45:17,658
I wouldn't want to be your enemy.

897
01:45:18,837 --> 01:45:20,600
What will you do?

898
01:45:33,552 --> 01:45:34,883
This way.

899
01:46:10,289 --> 01:46:13,679
Rich matrons pay well to be
pleasured by the bravest champions.

900
01:46:13,792 --> 01:46:16,283
I knew your brother would send assassins.

901
01:46:16,795 --> 01:46:19,389
I didn't realize he would send his best.

902
01:46:21,033 --> 01:46:23,126
Maximus, he doesn't know.

903
01:46:24,069 --> 01:46:27,300
My family was burned and crucified
while they were still alive.

904
01:46:27,372 --> 01:46:29,897
- I knew nothing.
- Don't lie to me.

905
01:46:36,315 --> 01:46:37,976
I wept for them.

906
01:46:38,150 --> 01:46:41,972
As you wept for your father?

907
01:46:42,054 --> 01:46:45,649
I have been living in a prison
of fear since that day.

908
01:46:46,158 --> 01:46:49,980
To be unable to mourn your
father for fear of your brother.

909
01:46:50,896 --> 01:46:54,059
To live in terror every moment of every day,

910
01:46:54,166 --> 01:46:56,930
because your son is heir to the throne.

911
01:46:58,837 --> 01:47:00,270
I have wept.

912
01:47:01,606 --> 01:47:04,439
My son was innocent.

913
01:47:05,277 --> 01:47:07,336
So is mine.

914
01:47:09,348 --> 01:47:12,408
Must my son die, too,
before you will trust me?

915
01:47:13,885 --> 01:47:16,843
What does it matter if I trust you or not?

916
01:47:17,723 --> 01:47:20,749
The gods have spared you.
Don't you understand?

917
01:47:20,859 --> 01:47:24,283
Today I saw a slave become more
powerful than the Emperor of Rome.

918
01:47:24,396 --> 01:47:26,193
The gods have spared me?

919
01:47:26,264 --> 01:47:29,722
I am at their mercy, with the
power only to amuse a mob.

920
01:47:29,801 --> 01:47:31,359
That is power.

921
01:47:31,803 --> 01:47:32,963
The mob is Rome.

922
01:47:33,071 --> 01:47:36,802
While Commodus controls
them, he controls everything.

923
01:47:37,042 --> 01:47:38,566
Listen to me.

924
01:47:39,111 --> 01:47:42,035
My brother has enemies,
most of all in the Senate.

925
01:47:42,314 --> 01:47:44,578
But while the people follow him,

926
01:47:44,649 --> 01:47:47,641
no one would dare stand up to him until you.

927
01:47:48,653 --> 01:47:51,076
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.

928
01:47:51,156 --> 01:47:54,785
There are some politicians who have
dedicated their lives to Rome.

929
01:47:54,893 --> 01:47:56,622
One man above all.

930
01:47:57,729 --> 01:48:00,789
If I can arrange it, will you meet him?

931
01:48:01,133 --> 01:48:03,055
Do you not understand?

932
01:48:03,301 --> 01:48:07,567
I may die in this cell tonight, or
in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave.

933
01:48:07,639 --> 01:48:10,267
What possible difference can I make?

934
01:48:10,575 --> 01:48:12,805
This man wants what you want.

935
01:48:12,911 --> 01:48:15,141
Then have him kill Commodus.

936
01:48:17,682 --> 01:48:19,513
I knew a man once,

937
01:48:20,452 --> 01:48:21,783
a noble man,

938
01:48:22,687 --> 01:48:25,611
a man of principle, who loved my father.

939
01:48:26,625 --> 01:48:28,650
And my father loved him.

940
01:48:30,629 --> 01:48:32,790
This man served Rome well.

941
01:48:37,135 --> 01:48:38,830
That man is gone.

942
01:48:40,005 --> 01:48:42,132
Your brother did his work well.

943
01:48:42,207 --> 01:48:43,868
Let me help you.

944
01:48:49,814 --> 01:48:52,874
Yes, you can help me.

945
01:48:56,220 --> 01:48:59,951
Forget you ever knew me,
and never come here again.

946
01:49:03,628 --> 01:49:06,358
Guard. The lady has finished with me.

947
01:49:34,825 --> 01:49:36,486
What's your name?

948
01:49:39,497 --> 01:49:40,896
Julian Crassus.

949
01:49:46,571 --> 01:49:47,765
Name?

950
01:49:49,106 --> 01:49:50,596
Marcus, sire.

951
01:49:51,542 --> 01:49:53,237
My father's name.

952
01:50:00,751 --> 01:50:05,450
They must have known of Maximus' escape
when they found the bodies of the four men.

953
01:50:06,290 --> 01:50:08,884
They thought it was a barbarian raid.

954
01:50:09,927 --> 01:50:13,090
These are good men, sire.
Loyal to the Emperor.

955
01:50:20,338 --> 01:50:22,397
Load arrows.

956
01:50:29,313 --> 01:50:31,235
Prepare to fire.

957
01:50:52,236 --> 01:50:55,501
Then perhaps it was you who knew.

958
01:50:56,340 --> 01:50:57,830
And never told me.

959
01:50:58,309 --> 01:51:00,573
- I didn't know.
- You didn't know?

960
01:51:02,079 --> 01:51:04,912
But a general is always in control.

961
01:51:06,284 --> 01:51:09,947
Always in command, isn't he?

962
01:51:11,489 --> 01:51:12,979
Yes, Caesar.

963
01:51:26,871 --> 01:51:29,533
Then give the command. Say it.

964
01:51:46,490 --> 01:51:47,650
Fire.

965
01:52:22,892 --> 01:52:24,189
Maximus?

966
01:52:24,927 --> 01:52:28,055
You commanded legions?
You had many victories?

967
01:52:28,931 --> 01:52:31,195
- Yes.
- In Germania?

968
01:52:33,068 --> 01:52:34,831
In many countries.

969
01:52:36,405 --> 01:52:37,736
General.

970
01:53:26,822 --> 01:53:28,710
You have a great name.

971
01:53:30,259 --> 01:53:33,251
He must kill your name before he kills you.

972
01:53:42,237 --> 01:53:43,568
Yes, at the far end.

973
01:53:43,639 --> 01:53:45,561
- Senator Gaius.
- Hello.

974
01:53:46,041 --> 01:53:47,997
Senator Gracchus.

975
01:53:49,645 --> 01:53:53,001
Don't often see you enjoying the
pleasures of the vulgar crowd.

976
01:53:53,115 --> 01:53:56,278
I don't pretend to be a
man of the people, Senator.

977
01:53:56,352 --> 01:53:58,912
But I do try to be a man for the people.

978
01:54:15,104 --> 01:54:19,598
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

979
01:54:24,847 --> 01:54:26,474
People of Rome.

980
01:54:28,817 --> 01:54:31,206
On the fourth day of Antioch,

981
01:54:31,854 --> 01:54:36,211
we can celebrate the 64th day of the games.

982
01:54:36,859 --> 01:54:41,125
And, in his majestic charity,

983
01:54:41,864 --> 01:54:46,062
the Emperor has deigned this day
to favor the people of Rome

984
01:54:46,669 --> 01:54:50,059
with an historical final match.

985
01:54:50,873 --> 01:54:55,469
Returning to the Colosseum today
after five years in retirement,

986
01:54:56,879 --> 01:55:00,337
Caesar is pleased to bring you

987
01:55:00,416 --> 01:55:04,204
the only undefeated champion

988
01:55:04,319 --> 01:55:06,310
in Roman history,

989
01:55:06,388 --> 01:55:11,246
the legendary Tigris of Gaul.

990
01:55:32,915 --> 01:55:36,078
He knows too well how to manipulate the mob.

991
01:55:36,185 --> 01:55:38,847
Marcus Aurelius had a dream
that was Rome, Proximo.

992
01:55:38,921 --> 01:55:41,685
This is not it.

993
01:55:41,757 --> 01:55:44,590
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.

994
01:55:45,427 --> 01:55:48,055
We mortals are but shadows and dust.

995
01:55:48,731 --> 01:55:50,790
Shadows and dust.

996
01:55:50,899 --> 01:55:54,756
Representing the training
lyceum of Antonius Proximo,

997
01:55:54,870 --> 01:55:58,533
Caesar is proud to give you

998
01:55:58,607 --> 01:56:02,429
Aelius Maximus.

999
01:56:15,257 --> 01:56:17,623
They embrace him like he's one of their own.

1000
01:56:17,726 --> 01:56:21,617
The mob is fickle, Brother.
He'll be forgotten in a month.

1001
01:56:24,399 --> 01:56:27,232
No, much sooner than that.

1002
01:56:29,138 --> 01:56:30,935
It's been arranged.

1003
01:56:31,072 --> 01:56:35,532
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1004
01:56:49,458 --> 01:56:52,416
We who are about to die salute you.

1005
01:56:55,697 --> 01:56:57,528
We're with you, Maximus.

1006
01:57:40,142 --> 01:57:41,370
Come on, finish him.

1007
01:58:10,172 --> 01:58:11,833

1008
01:58:44,206 --> 01:58:45,764
Loose. Loose.

1009
01:59:13,835 --> 01:59:15,928
- Get him.
- Kill him.

1010
01:59:17,406 --> 01:59:20,967
Kill.

1011
02:00:21,336 --> 02:00:23,531
Maximus the Merciful.

1012
02:00:32,714 --> 02:00:37,504
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1013
02:00:44,826 --> 02:00:47,624
Forward, guards. On battery.

1014
02:01:18,293 --> 02:01:20,682
What am I going to do with you?

1015
02:01:21,797 --> 02:01:25,289
You simply won't die.

1016
02:01:30,105 --> 02:01:32,437
Are we so different, you and I?

1017
02:01:33,575 --> 02:01:36,464
You take life when you have to, as I do.

1018
02:01:37,879 --> 02:01:41,906
I have only one more life
to take. Then it is done.

1019
02:01:42,084 --> 02:01:43,813
Then take it now.

1020
02:01:56,832 --> 02:01:58,891
They tell me your son

1021
02:01:59,668 --> 02:02:03,593
squealed like a girl when
they nailed him to the cross.

1022
02:02:05,774 --> 02:02:07,435
And your wife

1023
02:02:08,643 --> 02:02:10,565
moaned like a whore

1024
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:16,242
when they ravaged her again and again

1025
02:02:17,619 --> 02:02:18,984
and again.

1026
02:02:24,259 --> 02:02:27,990
The time for honoring yourself
will soon be at an end.

1027
02:02:32,634 --> 02:02:33,965
Highness.

1028
02:02:47,148 --> 02:02:51,517
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1029
02:03:01,496 --> 02:03:02,793
General.

1030
02:03:06,301 --> 02:03:08,292
Get back.

1031
02:03:09,371 --> 02:03:11,134
- General.
- Cicero.

1032
02:03:17,979 --> 02:03:19,004
General.

1033
02:03:19,181 --> 02:03:21,479
- Where are you camped?
- Ostia.

1034
02:03:27,923 --> 02:03:30,881
- We love you, Maximus.
- Praise the victor.

1035
02:03:30,992 --> 02:03:33,517
Tell the men their general lives. Find me.

1036
02:03:33,595 --> 02:03:35,187
- Move along.
- Find me.

1037
02:04:01,289 --> 02:04:03,245
Can they hear you?

1038
02:04:06,861 --> 02:04:10,353
- Who?
- Your family, in the afterlife.

1039
02:04:12,801 --> 02:04:15,224
- Oh, yes.
- What do you say to them?

1040
02:04:19,074 --> 02:04:20,564
To my boy,

1041
02:04:22,377 --> 02:04:24,902
I tell him I will see him again soon.

1042
02:04:24,980 --> 02:04:28,609
To keep his heels down when
he's riding his horse.

1043
02:04:29,884 --> 02:04:31,374
To my wife...

1044
02:04:33,888 --> 02:04:35,981
That is not your business.

1045
02:04:43,761 --> 02:04:46,616
And now they love Maximus for his mercy.

1046
02:04:48,065 --> 02:04:51,592
So I can't just kill him, or it
makes me even more unmerciful.

1047
02:04:52,937 --> 02:04:57,169
The whole thing's like some crazed nightmare.

1048
02:04:58,309 --> 02:05:00,072
He is defying you.

1049
02:05:00,244 --> 02:05:03,634
His every victory is an act of defiance.

1050
02:05:03,781 --> 02:05:07,410
The mob sees this, and so do the Senate.

1051
02:05:08,118 --> 02:05:11,007
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.

1052
02:05:12,489 --> 02:05:14,286
- Kill him.
- No.

1053
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:18,583
I will not make a martyr of him.

1054
02:05:25,703 --> 02:05:28,263
When I went to the Senate today,

1055
02:05:28,339 --> 02:05:33,197
I purposely told them about using the
grain reserves to pay for the games.

1056
02:05:34,645 --> 02:05:36,806
And did you note what happened?

1057
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:40,111
- Nothing.
- Exactly. Nothing.

1058
02:05:41,118 --> 02:05:43,450
Not a single word of protest.

1059
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:47,149
Even the insolent senator
Gracchus was silent as a mouse.

1060
02:05:47,224 --> 02:05:48,384
Why?

1061
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:53,823
I have been told of a certain sea snake

1062
02:05:53,897 --> 02:05:58,220
which has a very unusual
method of attracting its prey.

1063
02:05:58,402 --> 02:06:02,133
It will lie at the bottom of
the ocean, as if wounded.

1064
02:06:02,573 --> 02:06:05,404
Then its enemies will approach,

1065
02:06:05,508 --> 02:06:08,568
and yet it will lie quite still.

1066
02:06:08,912 --> 02:06:12,734
And then its enemies will
take little bites of it,

1067
02:06:12,849 --> 02:06:16,080
and yet it remains still.

1068
02:06:19,356 --> 02:06:20,482
So,

1069
02:06:21,825 --> 02:06:23,588
we will lie still,

1070
02:06:24,427 --> 02:06:27,760
and let our enemies come to us and nibble.

1071
02:06:28,798 --> 02:06:31,062
Have every senator followed.

1072
02:06:48,752 --> 02:06:52,540
Cicero, my old friend. I thought perhaps
I'd seen you for the last time.

1073
02:06:52,622 --> 02:06:55,045
- I thought you were dead.
- Close.

1074
02:06:55,125 --> 02:06:58,253
- How long have the men been in Ostia?
- All winter.

1075
02:06:58,561 --> 02:07:01,792
- And how do they look?
- Fat and bored.

1076
02:07:02,499 --> 02:07:05,559
- Who's in command?
- Some fool from Rome.

1077
02:07:06,970 --> 02:07:09,234
How soon could they be ready to fight?

1078
02:07:09,305 --> 02:07:11,102
For you, tomorrow.

1079
02:07:12,342 --> 02:07:14,833
I need you to do something for me.

1080
02:07:19,482 --> 02:07:20,915
Come see. Witness.

1081
02:07:20,984 --> 02:07:24,010
If you haven't been in the arena,
you can see the show here.

1082
02:07:24,120 --> 02:07:27,749
Giant Maximus is defeating
our Emperor Commodus.

1083
02:07:27,824 --> 02:07:30,418
What are we to do? He's defying everyone.

1084
02:07:30,493 --> 02:07:32,154
Why are you doing this?

1085
02:07:33,463 --> 02:07:34,794

1086
02:07:36,599 --> 02:07:40,160
- He got him!
- Give way! Give way!

1087
02:07:43,306 --> 02:07:45,171
Three casks of red wine.

1088
02:07:46,309 --> 02:07:48,971
My lady? I served your father at Vindobona.

1089
02:07:49,045 --> 02:07:50,478
- Back.
- My lady.

1090
02:07:50,547 --> 02:07:52,708
I served your father at Vindobona.

1091
02:07:53,049 --> 02:07:54,141
Back!

1092
02:07:54,217 --> 02:07:57,448
And I served the General
Maximus, I serve him still.

1093
02:07:58,955 --> 02:08:00,115
- Stop. Stop.
- Stop!

1094
02:08:03,159 --> 02:08:04,558
Stand back.

1095
02:08:05,862 --> 02:08:08,888
The General sends word. He
will meet your politician.

1096
02:08:10,633 --> 02:08:13,864
- For your loyalty, soldier.
- Thank you, my lady.

1097
02:08:14,003 --> 02:08:15,368
Hup!

1098
02:08:23,680 --> 02:08:25,011
Leave us.

1099
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:32,415
Senator Gracchus.

1100
02:08:46,236 --> 02:08:47,533
General.

1101
02:08:48,605 --> 02:08:51,335
I hope my coming here today
is evidence enough that

1102
02:08:51,407 --> 02:08:54,535
you can trust me.

1103
02:08:58,882 --> 02:09:01,373
- The Senate is with you?
- The Senate?

1104
02:09:02,852 --> 02:09:05,548
Yes. I can speak for them.

1105
02:09:06,122 --> 02:09:09,512
You can buy my freedom and
smuggle me out of Rome?

1106
02:09:09,859 --> 02:09:11,292
To what end?

1107
02:09:12,762 --> 02:09:15,094
Get me outside the city walls.

1108
02:09:15,698 --> 02:09:19,589
Have fresh horses ready to take me
to Ostia. My army is encamped there.

1109
02:09:19,702 --> 02:09:23,035
By nightfall of the second day, I
shall return at the head of 5,000 men.

1110
02:09:23,106 --> 02:09:25,301
But the legions all have new commanders

1111
02:09:25,408 --> 02:09:26,807
loyal to Commodus.

1112
02:09:26,910 --> 02:09:30,141
Let my men see me alive, and you
shall see where their loyalties lie.

1113
02:09:30,246 --> 02:09:31,907
This is madness.

1114
02:09:32,482 --> 02:09:35,815
No Roman army has entered the
capital in a hundred years.

1115
02:09:35,919 --> 02:09:38,149
I will not trade one
dictatorship for another!

1116
02:09:38,254 --> 02:09:41,781
The time for half-measures
and talk is over, Senator.

1117
02:09:42,292 --> 02:09:45,420
And after your glorious coup, what then?

1118
02:09:46,629 --> 02:09:50,292
You'll take your 5,000 warriors and leave?

1119
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:51,890
I will leave.

1120
02:09:52,402 --> 02:09:56,224
The soldiers will stay for your protection,
under the command of the Senate.

1121
02:09:56,306 --> 02:09:57,466
So,

1122
02:09:57,807 --> 02:10:02,073
once all of Rome is yours, you'll
just give it back to the people?

1123
02:10:03,613 --> 02:10:05,110
Tell me why.

1124
02:10:10,585 --> 02:10:13,679
Because that was the last
wish of a dying man.

1125
02:10:16,758 --> 02:10:18,623
I will kill Commodus.

1126
02:10:20,595 --> 02:10:23,621
The fate of Rome I leave to you.

1127
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:27,764
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1128
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:31,529
His daughter trusts you.

1129
02:10:35,543 --> 02:10:37,272
I will trust you.

1130
02:10:37,645 --> 02:10:39,670
But we have little time.

1131
02:10:40,214 --> 02:10:41,977
Give me two days,

1132
02:10:42,784 --> 02:10:45,014
and I will buy your freedom.

1133
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:47,119
And you...

1134
02:10:48,623 --> 02:10:50,215
You stay alive.

1135
02:10:51,726 --> 02:10:53,387
Or I'll be dead.

1136
02:10:55,229 --> 02:10:56,821
Now we must go.

1137
02:11:23,891 --> 02:11:27,486
He'll be waiting for you. Stand
at the foot of the Colossus.

1138
02:11:27,562 --> 02:11:29,154
He'll find you.

1139
02:12:13,274 --> 02:12:14,764
It won't work.

1140
02:12:15,810 --> 02:12:17,971
The Emperor knows too much.

1141
02:12:18,980 --> 02:12:20,038
And as for me,

1142
02:12:21,949 --> 02:12:24,008
it's becoming dangerous.

1143
02:12:25,286 --> 02:12:27,516
You will be paid on my return.

1144
02:12:29,624 --> 02:12:31,421
I give you my word.

1145
02:12:31,590 --> 02:12:34,650
Your word? What if you don't return?

1146
02:12:35,995 --> 02:12:38,987
Do you remember what it
was to have trust, Proximo?

1147
02:12:39,098 --> 02:12:40,292
Trust?

1148
02:12:44,537 --> 02:12:46,300
Who am I to trust?

1149
02:12:46,872 --> 02:12:50,035
- I will kill Commodus.
- Why would I want that?

1150
02:12:50,843 --> 02:12:52,538
He makes me rich.

1151
02:12:57,683 --> 02:13:00,516
I know that you are a man
of your word, General.

1152
02:13:02,288 --> 02:13:04,882
I know that you would die for honor.

1153
02:13:06,192 --> 02:13:08,148
You would die for Rome.

1154
02:13:09,195 --> 02:13:12,358
You would die for the
memory of your ancestors.

1155
02:13:12,465 --> 02:13:14,695
But I, on the other hand,

1156
02:13:17,470 --> 02:13:19,233
I'm an entertainer.

1157
02:13:22,741 --> 02:13:23,969
Guard!

1158
02:13:28,814 --> 02:13:31,374
He killed the man who set you free.

1159
02:13:40,558 --> 02:13:42,389
Praetorians, master.

1160
02:13:48,566 --> 02:13:49,726
Halt!

1161
02:14:54,899 --> 02:14:56,730
Where have you been?

1162
02:14:57,135 --> 02:14:58,727
I sent for you.

1163
02:15:00,305 --> 02:15:01,966
Please, Brother.

1164
02:15:07,745 --> 02:15:09,609
What's troubling you?

1165
02:15:12,016 --> 02:15:14,405
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

1166
02:15:16,187 --> 02:15:17,677
I don't know.

1167
02:15:19,691 --> 02:15:21,784
I thought you'd seen him.

1168
02:15:22,660 --> 02:15:25,515
He infects everyone like a putrid fever.

1169
02:15:26,998 --> 02:15:30,195
For the health of Rome,
the Senate must be bled.

1170
02:15:30,635 --> 02:15:32,626
And he will bleed, too.

1171
02:15:33,538 --> 02:15:34,937
Very soon.

1172
02:15:36,441 --> 02:15:38,102
But not tonight.

1173
02:15:53,124 --> 02:15:56,013
Do you remember what our father said once?

1174
02:15:57,395 --> 02:15:59,056
"It's a dream,

1175
02:16:00,965 --> 02:16:02,830
a frightful dream,

1176
02:16:05,370 --> 02:16:06,735
life is."

1177
02:16:09,407 --> 02:16:11,500
Do you think that's true?

1178
02:16:12,243 --> 02:16:13,733
I don't know.

1179
02:16:17,348 --> 02:16:18,872
I think it is.

1180
02:16:21,652 --> 02:16:24,348
And I have only you to share it with.

1181
02:17:01,959 --> 02:17:03,551
Open your mouth.

1182
02:17:40,898 --> 02:17:42,729
You know I love you.

1183
02:17:44,769 --> 02:17:46,327
And I love you.

1184
02:18:23,007 --> 02:18:24,531
Out. Get out!

1185
02:18:25,776 --> 02:18:26,970
Move!

1186
02:18:31,716 --> 02:18:33,809
Congratulations, General.

1187
02:18:33,885 --> 02:18:36,718
You've got very persuasive friends.

1188
02:18:42,627 --> 02:18:45,118
My brother's had Gracchus arrested.

1189
02:18:45,196 --> 02:18:48,529
We daren't wait any longer.
We must leave tonight.

1190
02:18:48,733 --> 02:18:52,362
Proximo will come at midnight
and take you to the gate.

1191
02:18:53,037 --> 02:18:56,700
Your servant, Cicero, will be
waiting there with horses.

1192
02:18:58,709 --> 02:19:01,007
- You have done all this?
- Yes.

1193
02:19:02,213 --> 02:19:03,908
You risk too much.

1194
02:19:04,882 --> 02:19:06,873
I have much to pay for.

1195
02:19:09,320 --> 02:19:11,515
You have nothing to pay for.

1196
02:19:11,589 --> 02:19:14,683
You love your son. You are strong for him.

1197
02:19:17,862 --> 02:19:20,251
I am tired of being strong.

1198
02:19:22,333 --> 02:19:26,531
My brother hates all the
world, and you most of all.

1199
02:19:26,904 --> 02:19:30,032
- Because your father chose me?
- No.

1200
02:19:31,342 --> 02:19:33,606
Because my father loved you.

1201
02:19:37,515 --> 02:19:39,904
And because I loved you.

1202
02:19:42,520 --> 02:19:44,181
A long time ago.

1203
02:19:48,926 --> 02:19:51,053
Was I very different then?

1204
02:19:57,635 --> 02:19:59,364
You laughed more.

1205
02:20:03,441 --> 02:20:05,864
I have felt alone all my life.

1206
02:20:07,144 --> 02:20:08,805
Except with you.

1207
02:20:11,916 --> 02:20:13,281
I must go.

1208
02:20:13,951 --> 02:20:15,077
Yes.

1209
02:20:43,581 --> 02:20:44,775
There. There.

1210
02:20:56,327 --> 02:20:57,851
And I've got you.

1211
02:21:00,865 --> 02:21:05,029
- Isn't it late to be playing legionnaire?
- I'm not a legionnaire.

1212
02:21:05,302 --> 02:21:07,896
- Not a legionnaire?
- I'm a gladiator.

1213
02:21:09,173 --> 02:21:10,663
A gladiator?

1214
02:21:11,342 --> 02:21:13,902
Gladiators only fight in the games.

1215
02:21:14,078 --> 02:21:17,502
Wouldn't you rather be a great
Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?

1216
02:21:17,581 --> 02:21:20,175
I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!

1217
02:21:23,020 --> 02:21:24,851
The savior of Rome?

1218
02:21:32,863 --> 02:21:34,592
And who said that?

1219
02:21:43,407 --> 02:21:44,999
Where's Lucius?

1220
02:21:46,243 --> 02:21:48,609
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

1221
02:21:51,549 --> 02:21:53,244
- She couldn't.
- Yes, she did.

1222
02:21:53,350 --> 02:21:55,511
She took it from a basket

1223
02:21:56,821 --> 02:22:00,587
and pressed it to her breast,
right here above her heart.

1224
02:22:02,393 --> 02:22:05,624
- It bit her in the breast?
- Yes.

1225
02:22:06,363 --> 02:22:10,288
You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies...

1226
02:22:10,701 --> 02:22:14,762
behave very strangely and do very
odd things in the name of love.

1227
02:22:14,872 --> 02:22:17,397
- I think it's silly.
- So do I.

1228
02:22:19,142 --> 02:22:20,769
So do I.

1229
02:22:21,312 --> 02:22:23,371
Sister, join us.

1230
02:22:23,981 --> 02:22:25,744
I've been reading to dear Lucius.

1231
02:22:25,816 --> 02:22:27,875
- I've been reading too.
- Yes.

1232
02:22:27,952 --> 02:22:32,218
He's a very clever little boy.
He'll make a grand emperor one day.

1233
02:22:33,824 --> 02:22:37,612
We've been reading about the great Mark
Antony and his adventures in Egypt.

1234
02:22:37,728 --> 02:22:40,253
The queen killed herself with a snake.

1235
02:22:40,331 --> 02:22:43,960
And just wait until you hear
what happened to our ancestors.

1236
02:22:44,068 --> 02:22:48,562
If you're very good, tomorrow night I'll
tell you the story of Emperor Claudius.

1237
02:22:49,807 --> 02:22:51,570
He was betrayed...

1238
02:22:52,476 --> 02:22:54,603
by those closest to him.

1239
02:22:56,480 --> 02:22:58,243
By his own blood.

1240
02:22:59,583 --> 02:23:02,074
They whispered in dark corners,

1241
02:23:02,153 --> 02:23:04,451
and went out late at night,

1242
02:23:04,688 --> 02:23:08,021
and conspired.

1243
02:23:10,594 --> 02:23:14,485
But the Emperor Claudius knew
that they were up to something.

1244
02:23:14,598 --> 02:23:17,158
He knew they were busy little bees.

1245
02:23:19,103 --> 02:23:22,163
And one night he sat down with one of them,

1246
02:23:22,940 --> 02:23:24,931
and he looked at her,

1247
02:23:25,843 --> 02:23:27,367
and he said,

1248
02:23:28,479 --> 02:23:31,004
"Tell me what you've been doing,

1249
02:23:31,682 --> 02:23:33,445
busy little bee,

1250
02:23:35,719 --> 02:23:38,847
or I shall strike down those dearest to you."

1251
02:23:39,990 --> 02:23:43,050
"You shall watch as I bathe in their blood."

1252
02:23:46,664 --> 02:23:49,053
And the Emperor was heartbroken.

1253
02:23:51,202 --> 02:23:56,060
The little bee had wounded him more deeply
than anyone else could ever have done.

1254
02:23:58,309 --> 02:24:01,164
And what do you think happened then, Lucius?

1255
02:24:01,812 --> 02:24:03,643
I don't know, Uncle.

1256
02:24:10,154 --> 02:24:12,714
The little bee told him everything.

1257
02:25:10,780 --> 02:25:13,874
Open, in the name of the Emperor!

1258
02:25:14,450 --> 02:25:15,746
Proximo!

1259
02:25:16,619 --> 02:25:19,816
Open the gates in the name of the Emperor!

1260
02:25:24,127 --> 02:25:25,617
Open the gates!

1261
02:25:31,434 --> 02:25:33,732
Open the gates, Proximo!

1262
02:25:34,170 --> 02:25:36,434
Do you want to die, old man?

1263
02:25:37,640 --> 02:25:38,766
Here.

1264
02:25:39,409 --> 02:25:41,400
Everything is prepared.

1265
02:25:41,577 --> 02:25:44,068
It seems you have won your freedom.

1266
02:25:44,147 --> 02:25:47,742
Proximo, are you in danger
of becoming a good man?

1267
02:25:52,822 --> 02:25:56,644
- Juba.
- All enemies of the Emperor die!

1268
02:25:57,193 --> 02:25:59,354
Open the gates! The Emperor commands!

1269
02:26:04,867 --> 02:26:06,823
Pull!

1270
02:26:09,005 --> 02:26:11,838
Move! Two columns on the left!

1271
02:26:15,645 --> 02:26:18,671
I only need moments, so do not
be careless with your lives.

1272
02:26:18,781 --> 02:26:21,511
If you don't want any part of
this, go back to your cells.

1273
02:26:21,617 --> 02:26:23,778
We'll wait here for you, Maximus.

1274
02:26:23,853 --> 02:26:26,708
- Strength and honor.
- Go!

1275
02:26:27,623 --> 02:26:29,454
Strength and honor.

1276
02:26:32,061 --> 02:26:34,894
Aim! Break the bars!

1277
02:27:26,215 --> 02:27:27,739

1278
02:27:30,786 --> 02:27:31,844

1279
02:27:42,031 --> 02:27:43,293
Shadows and dust.

1280
02:28:25,241 --> 02:28:26,333
Maximus!

1281
02:28:31,948 --> 02:28:33,347
- I'm sorry.
- No!

1282
02:28:59,775 --> 02:29:01,140
It's done.

1283
02:29:08,117 --> 02:29:10,005
And what of my nephew?

1284
02:29:11,053 --> 02:29:13,044
And what of his mother?

1285
02:29:15,124 --> 02:29:17,684
Should they share her lover's fate?

1286
02:29:19,395 --> 02:29:21,454
Or should I be merciful?

1287
02:29:24,166 --> 02:29:26,054
Commodus the Merciful.

1288
02:29:32,541 --> 02:29:34,839
Lucius will stay with me now.

1289
02:29:35,978 --> 02:29:37,809
And if his mother

1290
02:29:39,215 --> 02:29:41,308
so much as looks at me

1291
02:29:42,485 --> 02:29:44,976
in a manner that displeases me,

1292
02:29:46,922 --> 02:29:48,412
he will die.

1293
02:29:51,827 --> 02:29:55,092
If she decides to be noble,

1294
02:29:56,866 --> 02:29:58,925
and takes her own life,

1295
02:30:00,536 --> 02:30:02,026
he will die.

1296
02:30:05,608 --> 02:30:07,337
And as for you,

1297
02:30:10,179 --> 02:30:11,942
you will love me,

1298
02:30:12,682 --> 02:30:14,513
as I loved you.

1299
02:30:16,085 --> 02:30:19,748
You will provide me with
an heir of pure blood,

1300
02:30:20,756 --> 02:30:22,553
so that Commodus

1301
02:30:23,125 --> 02:30:26,083
and his progeny will rule
for a thousand years.

1302
02:30:30,733 --> 02:30:32,462
Am I not merciful?

1303
02:30:54,323 --> 02:30:56,951
Am I not merciful?

1304
02:31:09,171 --> 02:31:12,368
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus

1305
02:31:40,634 --> 02:31:43,364
I'm a soldier. I obey.

1306
02:31:46,073 --> 02:31:50,362
Nothing happens to anyone that he
is not fitted by nature to bear.

1307
02:32:23,342 --> 02:32:24,604
Maximus.

1308
02:32:25,444 --> 02:32:26,570
Maximus.

1309
02:32:31,016 --> 02:32:32,779
They call for you.

1310
02:32:34,787 --> 02:32:38,052
The general who became a slave.

1311
02:32:39,291 --> 02:32:41,714
The slave who became a gladiator.

1312
02:32:43,062 --> 02:32:45,895
The gladiator who defied an emperor.

1313
02:32:47,800 --> 02:32:49,529
A striking story.

1314
02:32:50,703 --> 02:32:53,900
Now the people want to
know how the story ends.

1315
02:32:56,275 --> 02:32:58,539
Only a famous death will do.

1316
02:33:00,446 --> 02:33:02,971
And what could be more glorious

1317
02:33:03,382 --> 02:33:07,113
than to challenge the Emperor
himself in the great arena?

1318
02:33:09,455 --> 02:33:12,481
- You would fight me?
- Why not?

1319
02:33:13,726 --> 02:33:15,751
Do you think I'm afraid?

1320
02:33:16,562 --> 02:33:19,554
I think you have been afraid all your life.

1321
02:33:19,665 --> 02:33:23,396
Unlike Maximus the Invincible,
who knows no fear?

1322
02:33:29,141 --> 02:33:32,167
I knew a man who once said,
"Death smiles at us all."

1323
02:33:33,445 --> 02:33:35,936
"All a man can do is smile back."

1324
02:33:37,683 --> 02:33:39,116
I wonder,

1325
02:33:39,752 --> 02:33:42,516
did your friend smile at his own death?

1326
02:33:42,922 --> 02:33:44,446
You must know.

1327
02:33:47,326 --> 02:33:49,123
He was your father.

1328
02:33:52,998 --> 02:33:55,330
You loved my father, I know.

1329
02:33:56,835 --> 02:33:58,325
But so did I.

1330
02:33:59,972 --> 02:34:02,532
That makes us brothers, doesn't it?

1331
02:34:05,177 --> 02:34:07,304
Smile for me now, Brother.

1332
02:34:12,818 --> 02:34:15,616
Strap on his armor. Conceal the wound.

1333
02:35:10,042 --> 02:35:11,998
Ring formation!

1334
02:35:43,175 --> 02:35:45,643
Off with his head, Maximus!

1335
02:37:03,822 --> 02:37:05,380
Quintus, sword!

1336
02:37:06,892 --> 02:37:08,689
Give me your sword!

1337
02:37:12,131 --> 02:37:14,122
Sword! Give me a sword!

1338
02:37:15,634 --> 02:37:17,065
Sheathe your swords!

1339
02:37:17,365 --> 02:37:19,031
Sheathe your swords!

1340
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:35,937

1341
02:39:43,181 --> 02:39:44,512

1342
02:39:46,184 --> 02:39:47,674
Free my men.

1343
02:39:49,121 --> 02:39:51,817
Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated.

1344
02:39:53,025 --> 02:39:55,118
There was a dream that was Rome.

1345
02:39:55,794 --> 02:39:57,659
It shall be realized.

1346
02:39:58,397 --> 02:40:00,991
These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius.

1347
02:40:01,867 --> 02:40:03,858
Free the prisoners! Go!

1348
02:40:28,660 --> 02:40:29,922

1349
02:40:31,863 --> 02:40:33,421
Lucius is safe.

1350
02:40:49,748 --> 02:40:51,147
Go to them.

1351
02:41:40,966 --> 02:41:42,456
You're home.

1352
02:42:09,027 --> 02:42:11,621
Is Rome worth one good man's life?

1353
02:42:15,467 --> 02:42:17,298
We believed it once.

1354
02:42:20,472 --> 02:42:22,531
Make us believe it again.

1355
02:42:26,078 --> 02:42:28,171
He was a soldier of Rome.

1356
02:42:32,017 --> 02:42:33,416
Honor him.

1357
02:42:33,885 --> 02:42:36,046
Who will help me carry him?

1358
02:43:20,799 --> 02:43:22,870
Now we are free.

1359
02:43:28,870 --> 02:43:30,735
I will see you again.

1360
02:43:33,608 --> 02:43:35,098
But not yet.

1361
02:43:36,077 --> 02:43:37,408
Not yet.
