1
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,990
颠峰时期的罗马帝国非常庞大

2
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,360
领土由非洲沙漠伸延至...

3
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,090
英国北部边境

4
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,300
全球超过四份一人口活于...

5
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,470
凯撒王朝的统治下

6
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,370
在公元180年的冬天 奥利里亚斯大帝...

7
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,780
跟日耳曼外族维持了12年的战争...

8
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,220
正接近尾声

9
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,550
只差最后一个据点 罗马人便能取得胜利...

10
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,050
并把和平带给整个帝国

11
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,750
日耳曼

12
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,448
长官
Sir.

13
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,782
将军
General.

14
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,794
长官
Sir.

15
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,478
又瘦又饿
Lean and hungry.

16
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,359
-还没有消息? -没有
-Still nothing? -Not a sign.

17
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,320
-他去了多久? -接近两小时了
-How long has he been gone? -Nearly two hours.

18
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,075
他们会迎战吗?
Will they fight, sir?

19
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,660
很快便会知道
We shall know soon enough.

20
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,287
士兵  我命令了你把弩炮推向前
Soldier, I ordered you to move those catapults forward.

21
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,665
-射程未够远 -距离远一点也好
-They're out of range. -Range is good.

22
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,795
-对骑兵的威胁... -可以接受  同意吧?
-The danger to the cavalry... -Is acceptable. Agreed?

23
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,555
他们说不
They say no.

24
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,042
人们应该清楚当自己被征服了
People should know when they're conquered.

25
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,305
你会吗  昆特斯?
Would you, Quintus?

26
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,515
我会吗?
Would I?

27
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,951
-力量与荣耀  -力量与荣耀
-Strength and honor. -Strength and honor.

28
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,752
我发出指示  便开始进攻
At my signal, unleash hell.

29
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,984
装弩炮弹
Load the catapults.

30
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,820
步兵列阵准备前进
Infantry form up for advance.

31
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,699
-弓箭手准备好 -弓箭手!
-Archers ready. -Archers!

32
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,284
-搭箭!  搭箭!
-Nock! -Nock!

33
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,434
兄弟们!
Fratres!

34
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,353
-麦克西马!  -麦克西马!
-Maximus! -Maximus!

35
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,900
三星期后  我会收割我的农作物
Three weeks from now, I will be harvesting my crops.

36
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:46,446
想像你会在哪里  便会实现
Imagine where you will be, and it will be so.

37
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:50,492
保持阵线!  跟着我!
Hold the line! Stay with me!

38
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,245
如果你发现得自己一个人
If you find yourself alone,

39
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,331
骑行于绿野  阳光洒在脸上
riding in green fields with the sun on your face,

40
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,709
不用苦恼
do not be troubled.

41
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:04,172
因为你已到了极乐世界 已经死了!
For you are in Elysium, and you're already dead!

42
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,009
兄弟们
Brothers,

43
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,221
我们一生的功业
what we do in life

44
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,932
是永垂不朽的
echoes in eternity.

45
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,733
拉!
Pull!

46
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,376
弩炮准备好了!
Cohorts ready, sir!

47
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,389
弓箭手  点火!
Archers, ignite!

48
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,267
-点火!  -点火!
-Ignite! -Ignite!

49
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,817
弓箭手  拉弓!
Archers, draw!

50
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,655
射!
Loose!

51
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,770
好了  将士们  准备!
All right, men, ready!

52
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,569
保持位置!
Hold the line!

53
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,955
射!
Loose!

54
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,498
装炮!
Reload!

55
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,547
保持位置!
Hold the line!

56
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,966
-拉弓! -射!
-Draw! -Loose!

57
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:22,894
跟着我!
Stay with me!

58
00:09:50,840 --> 00:12:28,705
罗马胜利!
Roma victor!

59
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,070
普利托里亚十四

60
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,041
你认为他真的快死了?
Do you think he's really dying?

61
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,461
说他快死已说了十年
He's been dying for 10 years.

62
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,965
如果他不是快死了 他不会叫我们去
If he weren't really dying, he wouldn't have sent for us.

63
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,842
或者他只是挂念我们
Maybe he just misses us.

64
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,512
那些参议员呢? 不然他不会召见他们的...
And the senators? He wouldn't have summoned them if...

65
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,888
安静  卡莫德
Peace, Commodus.

66
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,264
在路上两星期
After two weeks on the road,

67
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,017
你不断计算 弄得我头也痛了
your incessant scheming is hurting my head.

68
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,861
他已作了决定 他将会宣布
He's made his decision. He's going to announce it.

69
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,408
他会传位给我
He will name me.

70
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,915
到时我要做的第一件事...
The first thing I shall do when...

71
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,004
就是用竞技向国王陛下致敬
Is honor him with games won'thy of His Majesty.

72
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,926
现在 我要做的第一件事 就是洗个热水澡
For now, the first thing I shall do is have a hot bath.

73
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,429
陛下?
Your Highness?

74
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,227
我们就快到了
We seem to be almost there, sir.

75
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,610
-陛下 -皇上在哪里?
-Sire. -Where's the Emperor?

76
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,364
陛下 他在前面 他们已经去了19天
He's at the front, sire. They've been gone for 19 days.

77
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,658
还不断有伤兵进来
The wounded are still coming in.

78
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,368
拉我的马来
My horse.

79
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,120
陛下
My lord.

80
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,749
吻?
Kiss?

81
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:16,205
你再次表现了你的英勇 麦克西马
You have proved your valor yet again, Maximus.

82
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,085
让我们盼望  最后一次
Let us hope, for the last time.

83
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,755
没有战斗对手了  陛下
There's no one left to fight, sire.

84
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,507
永远都会有战斗对手
There is always someone left to fight.

85
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,510
我应该怎样奖赏罗马最伟大的将军?
How can I reward Rome's greatest general?

86
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,517
让我回家吧
Let me go home.

87
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,313
回家
Home.

88
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,667
凯撒  他们向你致敬
They honor you, Caesar.

89
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,544
是向你 麦克西马 他们向你致敬
It's for you, Maximus. They honor you.

90
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,237
我错过了吗? 我错过了这战役?
Have I missed it? Have I missed the battle?

91
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,699
你错过了这战争
You have missed the war.

92
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,992
父亲  恭喜你
Father, congratulations.

93
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,870
我会献祭100头公牛 向你的胜利致敬
I shall sacrifice 100 bulls to honor your triumph.

94
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,622
不用浪费公牛
Save the bulls.

95
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,166
向麦克西马致敬吧 是他赢了这战役
Honor Maximus. He won the battle.

96
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,919
-将军 -陛下
-General. -Highness.

97
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,507
罗马向你致敬 而我像兄弟般拥戴你
Rome salutes you, and I embrace you as a brother.

98
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,384
很久了  老朋友
It has been too long, my old friend.

99
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,927
陛下
Highness.

100
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:55,596
来  父亲  捉着我的手
Here, Father. Take my arm.

101
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,393
是时候我要走了
I think it is time for me to leave.

102
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,870
罗马的光辉也不过这样
So much for the glory of Rome.

103
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,710
很出色的战事
Magnificent battle.

104
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,361
将军  还没死吗?
General. Still alive?

105
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,737
还没死
Still alive.

106
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,447
上天真爱开玩笑
The gods must have a sense of humor.

107
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,200
-上天最眷顾你 -维拉里斯
-The gods must love you. -Valerius.

108
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,161
将军 你回兵营 还是回罗马?
Back to barracks, General? Or to Rome?

109
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,331
回家  见我太太  儿子 还有收成
Home. My wife, my son, the harvest.

110
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,294
真难想像麦克西马做农夫
Maximus the farmer. I still have difficulty imagining that.

111
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:35,006
昆特斯 污泥比血容易洗掉
You know, dirt cleans off a lot easier than blood, Quintus.

112
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,174
-他在这里 -陛下
-Here he is. -Highness.

113
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,427
佳斯议员  科高议员
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

114
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,388
小心佳斯 他会向你花言巧语
Beware of Gaius. He'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear,

115
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:46,058
然后有天你醒来 只会说"共和国"
and you'll wake up one day and all you'll say is, "Republic, republic, republic."

116
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,811
为什么不? 罗马创建时就是共和国
Well, why not? Rome was founded as a republic.

117
00:19:48,895 --> 00:19:51,772
对  而共和国里 权力在议院手上
Yes, and in a republic the senate has the power.

118
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,066
但佳斯议员当然不会受那影响
But Senator Gaius isn't influenced by that, of course.

119
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,153
你站那一边  将军?  帝皇还是议院?
Where do you stand, General? Emperor or Senate?

120
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,487
士兵的优势
A soldier has the advantage

121
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,991
就是可以看进敌人眼里
of being able to look his enemy in the eye, Senator.

122
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:06,078
有军队支持 你绝对可以从政
Well, with an army behind you, you could be extremely political.

123
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,290
我警告了你  现在我要救你 失陪了
I warned you. Now I shall save you. Senators.

124
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,551
麦克西马
Maximus.

125
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,138
我需要你这样的能人
I'm going to need good men like you.

126
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,809
我如何为您效劳  陛下?
How may I be of service, Highness?

127
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,937
你是懂得发号令的人
You're a man who knows what it is to command.

128
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,358
你发出命令  他们遵从命令 战事便赢了
You give your orders, the orders are obeyed, and the battle is won.

129
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:40,237
但这些议员 图谋 争吵 谄媚 欺诈
But these senators scheme, squabble and flatter and deceive.

130
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,783
麦克西马  我们一定要从政客手上拯救罗马
Maximus, we must save Rome from the politicians, my friend.

131
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,994
到时我可以依靠你吗?
Can I count on you when the time comes?

132
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:55,753
陛下 当你父亲放我走时 我打算回家
Highness, when your father releases me, I intend to return home.

133
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:59,006
回家?  对  没人比你更有这资格
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.

134
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,345
不要太轻松了 我很快便会找你
Don't get too comfortable. I may call on you before long.

135
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,016
露西娜来了  你知吗?
Lucilla's here. Did you know?

136
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,435
她没有忘记你
She's not forgotten you.

137
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,064
而现在  你是英雄
And now, you're the great man.

138
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,870
如果你是男儿身
If only you had been born a man,

139
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,207
你会是出色的凯撒
what a Caesar you would have made.

140
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,335
父亲
Father.

141
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,343
你会很坚强
You would have been strong.

142
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,680
我想知道  你会是正直的吗?
I wonder, would you have been just?

143
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,100
我会是你教导的一样
I would have been what you taught me to be.

144
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,645
你的旅途怎样?
How was your journey?

145
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,482
很长  不舒服  为什么要我来?
Long. Uncomfortable. Why have I come?

146
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,652
我要你帮忙  同你哥哥
I need your help. With your brother.

147
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,779
当然
Of course.

148
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,990
他爱你  一向都是
He loves you. He always has.

149
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,242
而...
And...

150
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,289
现在是他最需要你的时候
he will need you now, more than ever.

151
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,254
不说政治了
Enough of politics.

152
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,466
让我们假装你是个忠诚的女儿
Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter,

153
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,427
而我是个好父亲
and I am a good father.

154
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,727
这是很好的假定  不是吗?
This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?

155
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,200
早安
Good morning to you.

156
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,882
我需要多三匹马
I need three more horses.

157
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,936
一!  二!  三!
One! Two! Three!

158
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,938
四!
Four!

159
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,273
一!  二!
One! Two!

160
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,416
你召见我  凯撒?
You sent for me, Caesar?

161
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,049
-凯撒? -再告诉我  麦克西马
-Caesar? -Tell me again, Maximus.

162
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:49,844
我们在这里做什么?
Why are we here?

163
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,681
为了罗马的荣耀  陛下
For the glory of the empire, sire.

164
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,182
是的
Yes.

165
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,186
对  我记起了
Yes, I remember.

166
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,525
你看见那地图吗?
Do you see that map, Maximus?

167
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,862
那是我创造了的世界
That is the world which I created.

168
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,364
25年了
For 25 years,

169
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,785
我侵略  杀人  扩张帝国
I have conquered, spilt blood, expanded the empire.

170
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,957
我做凯撒以来 只有四年没有战争
Since I became Caesar, I've known four years without war.

171
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,543
20年里只有四年和平
Four years of peace in 20.

172
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,336
为了什么?
And for what?

173
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,556
我只带了剑  没有其他
I brought the sword. Nothing more.

174
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,142
凯撒  你一生...
Caesar, your life...

175
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,811
请不要那样称呼我
Please. Please don't call me that.

176
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,355
来  请
Come. Please.

177
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,524
来坐下
Come sit.

178
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,069
现在让我们谈谈
Let us talk together now,

179
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,072
简单的男人对话
very simply, as men.

180
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,575
麦克西马
Well, Maximus,

181
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,120
说吧
talk.

182
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:04,084
我有五千个手下在冰冻的泥里
Five thousand of my men are out there in the freezing mud.

183
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,961
当中有三千个重伤和流血
Three thousand of them are bloodied and cleaved.

184
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,504
有二千个永不会离开这里
Two thousand will never leave this place.

185
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,799
我不会相信他们的战斗和死亡 是没有意义的
I will not believe that they fought and died for nothing.

186
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,509
那你会相信什么?
And what would you believe?

187
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:16,430
他们为了你和罗马而战
They fought for you and for Rome.

188
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,307
罗马是什么?
And what is Rome, Maximus?

189
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,895
我见过很多世界上其他的地方
I've seen much of the rest of the world.

190
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:26,982
很残暴和黑暗  罗马是曙光
It is brutal and cruel and dark. Rome is the light.

191
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,984
但你未去过罗马
Yet you have never been there.

192
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,528
你没见过它变成怎样
You have not seen what it has become.

193
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,657
我快死了
I am dying, Maximus.

194
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,575
当一个人看见自己的尽头
When a man sees his end,

195
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,703
他希望知道他是活得有意义的
he wants to know there was some purpose to his life.

196
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,999
世人将来会怎样评论我?
How will the world speak my name in years to come?

197
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,377
我会被认为是哲学家?
Will I be known as the philosopher?

198
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,962
斗士?
The warrior?

199
00:25:48,254 --> 00:25:49,672
暴君?
The tyrant?

200
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:55,803
还是让罗马重现真本性的皇帝?
Or will I be the Emperor who gave Rome back her true self?

201
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,223
曾经有一个罗马梦
There was once a dream that was Rome.

202
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,059
你只能低声说
You could only whisper it.

203
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:05,229
太大声了它便会消失
Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish,

204
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,147
它非常脆弱
it was so fragile.

205
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,151
我恐怕它捱不过冬天
And I fear that it will not survive the winter.

206
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,154
麦克西马
Maximus,

207
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,992
让我们低声说
let us whisper now,

208
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,952
你和我
together, you and I.

209
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,162
你有个儿子
You have a son.

210
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,541
说说你的家
Tell me about your home.

211
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,675
我的屋在特鲁希略的山上
My house is in the hills above Trujillo.

212
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,803
一个很简单的地方
A very simple place.

213
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:41,140
阳光温了粉红色石头
Pink stones that warm in the sun.

214
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,727
厨房花园日间有香草气味
A kitchen garden that smells of herbs in the day,

215
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,396
晚上则有茉莉香
jasmine in the evening.

216
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,650
通过闸门是一棵巨大的杨树
Through the gate is a giant poplar.

217
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,778
无花果  苹果  啤梨
Figs, apples, pears.

218
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,699
泥土是黑色的 就像我太太的头发一样黑
The soil, Marcus, black. Black like my wife's hair.

219
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,910
南面斜坡是葡萄 北面是橄榄
Grapes on the south slopes, olives on the north.

220
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,246
野马在我家附近玩 它们会逗我儿子
Wild ponies play near my house. They tease my son.

221
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,956
他想做它们一份子
He wants to be one of them.

222
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,833
你上一次在家是何时?
When was the last time you were home?

223
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:11,045
2年零264天  再加上今早
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

224
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:15,966
我妒忌你  麦克西马 那是很好的家
I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home.

225
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,386
值得为它奋斗
Worth fighting for.

226
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,349
还有一项职责...
There is one more duty...

227
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,644
我要在你回家前交给你
that I ask of you before you go home.

228
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,690
你要我做什么  凯撒?
What would you have me do, Caesar?

229
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:35,402
我要你在我死后 做罗马的保护者
I want you to become the protector of Rome after I die.

230
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:39,573
我会为了一个目标赐你权力
I will empower you to one end alone,

231
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:43,577
就是把权力还给罗马的人民
to give power back to the people of Rome,

232
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,997
和终止使罗马残破的腐败
and end the corruption that has crippled it.

233
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:56,924
你会接受我给你的这份光荣吗?
Will you accept this great honor that I have offered you?

234
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,219
绝对不愿意
With all my heart, no.

235
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,515
麦克西马
Maximus,

236
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,018
那正是为什么要你
that is why it must be you.

237
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,187
但应该找个长官  议员
But surely a prefect, a senator,

238
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,981
认识那城市和她政治的人
somebody who knows the city, who understands her politics.

239
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,026
但你没有被她的政治腐化
But you have not been corrupted by her politics.

240
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,660
-那卡莫德呢? -卡莫德不是有道德的人
-And Commodus? -Commodus is not a moral man.

241
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,247
你年轻时便已知道这点
You have known that since you were young.

242
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,290
卡莫德不能统治
Commodus cannot rule.

243
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,751
一定不能让他统治
He must not rule.

244
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:37,089
你是我应该有的儿子
You are the son that I should have had.

245
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,636
卡莫德会接受我这决定
Commodus will accept my decision.

246
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:49,685
他知道军队忠于你
He knows that you command the loyalty of the army.

247
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,150
我需要时间考虑
I need some time, sire.

248
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,693
好的
Yes.

249
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:01,321
日落前  希望你会同意
By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.

250
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,575
来像我儿子般拥抱我
Now embrace me as my son.

251
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,706
和给我这老人拿多张被来
And bring an old man another blanket.

252
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,433
-现在我父亲偏袒你 -公主殿下
-My father favors you now. -My lady.

253
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,020
-已前不是这样 -很多东西已变了
-It was not always so. -Many things change.

254
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,523
很多东西  但不是全部
Many things. Not everything.

255
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,069
麦克西马  等等
Maximus, stop.

256
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,533
让我看你的脸
Let me see your face.

257
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,788
-你好像不高兴 -我损失了很多手下
-You seem upset. -I lost many men.

258
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:55,042
我父亲要你做什么?
What did my father want with you?

259
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:59,087
在我回家前祝福我
To wish me well before I leave for home.

260
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,215
你讲大话
You're lying.

261
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:04,885
我永远知道你在讲大话 因为你讲得很差劲
I could always tell when you were lying, because you were never any good at it.

262
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,470
我并没有得到你信任
I never acquired your comfort with it.

263
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,596
对
True.

264
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,765
但你不需要
But then you never had to.

265
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,976
军人的一生并较简单
Life is more simple for a soldier.

266
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,980
还是你觉得我无情?
Or do you think me heartless?

267
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,734
我觉得你有生存的天份
I think you have a talent for survival.

268
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,283
麦克西马  等等
Maximus, stop.

269
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,372
再见到我真的那么讨厌吗?
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?

270
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,958
不  战斗令我很累
No. I'm tired from battle.

271
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,378
看见我父亲的脆弱令你伤心吧
It hurts you to see my father so fragile.

272
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:46,927
卡莫德期望父亲会在日内宣布继承人
Commodus expects that my father will announce his succession within days.

273
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,473
你会效力我哥哥 就像效力我父亲一样吗?
Will you serve my brother as you served his father?

274
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,811
我会永远为罗马效力
I will always serve Rome.

275
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,523
你知不知道
Do you know,

276
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:02,109
我有为你祈祷
I still remember you in my prayers.

277
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:06,071
是的  我祈祷
Oh, yes. I pray.

278
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,954
我为你丈夫的去世难过 我有哀悼他
I was sad to hear of your husband's death. I mourned him.

279
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,667
-谢谢 -听说你有个儿子
-Thank you. -And I hear you have a son.

280
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,754
是  他叫路西亚斯
Yes. Lucius.

281

00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:35,216
友情价是五千元
That's 5,000 for an old friend.

421
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:56,278
快!到底要多久才能到我自己的家?
Come on! How long does it take to get into my own house?

422
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,280
我是朴森姆
I am Proximo.

423
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,534
接下来是你悲惨人生的最后数天
I shall be closer to you for the next few days,

424
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,827
而我将会是比你母亲...
which will be the last of your miserable lives,

425
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:08,249
更亲近的人
than that bitch of a mother that brought you screaming into this world.

426
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,877
我买你不是为了陪伴
I did not pay good money for you for your company.

427
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:16,298
而是我用你的死亡来赚钱
I paid it so that I could profit from your death.

428
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:20,803
就像你母亲看着你出生...
And as your mother was there at your beginning,

429
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,390
我会伴着你死亡
so I shall be there at your end.

430
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:28,936
你将会死  当你死时...
And when you die, and die you shall,

431
00:52:29,854 --> 00:52:32,773
你会转化成这声音...
your transition shall be to the sound of...

432
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,946
斗士们...
Gladiators,

433
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,615
我向你致敬
I salute you.

434
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,413
红色
Red.

435
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:54,837
黄色
Yellow.

436
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,682
好
Good.

437
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,851
红色
-Red. -Red.

438
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,065
西班牙佬
Spaniard.

439
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,768
暂时够了!
That's enough for the moment!

440
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,728
迟早会到他
His time will come.

441
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:56,815
下个
Next.

442
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,497
西班牙佬
Spaniard,

443
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,792
你为什么不还手?
why don't you fight?

444
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:16,627
我们全部都要打
We all have to fight.

445
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,420
我不打的
Well, I don't fight.

446
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:22,299
我不应在这里 我是作家  我写作...
I shouldn't be here, I'm a scribe, I write down words,

447
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,259
我会说七种语言
and speak seven languages.

448
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,386
那好
Good.

449
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:29,348
明天你可用七种语言尖叫
Tomorrow, you can scream in seven languages.

450
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:40,984
或者作家就可以赢取自由
Perhaps the scribe will be the one who wins his freedom.

451
00:54:41,986 --> 00:54:43,278
自由?
Freedom?

452
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,198
我需要做什么?
What do I have to do?

453
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,909
你进竞技场  杀了我
You go in the arena and you kill me.

454
00:54:48,993 --> 00:54:50,369
还有他...
And him,

455
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,080
和这努米底亚人...
and the Numidian,

456
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,748
和这逃兵
and the deserter.

457
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,793
再多100个人
And 100 more.

458
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:00,713
直到你杀了所有斗士 你便自由了
And when there's no more to fight, you're free.

459
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,132
我做不到
I can't do that.

460
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,384
做不到?
No?

461
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,058
但我做得到
But I can.

462
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,784
那是你守护神的标记?
Is that the sign of your gods?

463
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,083
那样不会触怒他们吗?
Will that not anger them?

464
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:01,064
天神特别眷顾你
The gods favor you.

465
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,609
红是天神的颜色
Red is the gods' color.

466
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:07,154
今天你会需要他们帮助
You will need their help today.

467
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,153
朴森姆!
Proximo!

468
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,661
还是那德国人领先?
Still leading with the German?

469
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,829
群众喜欢野蛮人
The crowd love a barbarian.

470
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,207
而且他令我富有
Besides that, he's making me rich.

471
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,918
那努米底亚人落过场未?
Has that Numidian fought before?

472
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,337
未  第一次
No, first time.

473
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:08,382
那个  是苦力  士兵?
And that one, laborer, soldier?

474
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,050
他是西班牙人
He's a Spaniard.

475
00:57:10,134 --> 00:57:13,220
在场上像个废人一样
He might as well be a eunuch for what he brings to the ring.

476
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:18,392
五百元买努米底亚人 和西班牙人那队会过关
500 sestertii, the Numidian and Spaniard team makes it through.

477
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:22,187
一千元  如果努米底亚人独自过关
And 1,000, that the Numidian makes it through alone.

478
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,817
你要我买自己的人输?
Are you asking me to bet against my own man?

479
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,153
那是不道德的
It's unethical.

480
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,114
如果我加到二千元呢?
What if I make it 2,000?

481
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:49,464
你们有些在想你不会搏斗
Some of you are thinking you won't fight,

482
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,050
有些觉得你不能搏斗
some that you can't fight.

483
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:56,888
他们全部都这样说 直到站在场中
They all say that until they're out there.

484
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:00,851
听
Listen.

485
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:03,854
杀!
-Kill! Kill! Kill! -Kill! Kill! Kill!

486
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,697
把这个插进另一个人的血肉里...
Thrust this into another mars flesh,

487
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,783
他们就会欢呼和拥戴你
and they will applaud and love you for that.

488
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,285
而你...
And you,

489
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,205
你会开始因为那样...
you may begin to love them

490
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,458
而喜欢他们
for that.

491
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:32,049
最终我们都要死
Ultimately, we're all dead men.

492
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,887
悲哀的是我们不能选择怎样死
Sadly, we cannot choose how,

493
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:40,932
但我们可以决定怎样去到那一刻...
but we can decide how we meet that end,

494
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,353
而令别人记得...
in order that we are remembered

495
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,522
我们
as men.

496
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:48,649
快!
Come on!

497
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,904
左面的  拔盾!
On the left, draw your shields!

498
00:58:54,947 --> 00:58:57,324
右面的  拔剑!
On the right, draw your swords!

499
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,160
杀!杀!
-Kill! Kill! Kill! -Kill! Kill! Kill!

500
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,705
红跟黄两个一队
Pair them up, red with yellow.

501
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:09,961
下个!
Next!

502
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:16,927
打!
Move!

503
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,333
夺权者!
Usurper!

504
01:02:35,343 --> 01:02:36,250
罗马国会及人民

505
01:02:57,982 --> 01:03:00,692
-走! -我们不要你统治  卡莫德!
-Go away! -You'll never rule us, Commodus!

506
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:35,810
他像个胜利英雄般进城 但他胜了什么?
He enters Rome like a conquering hero. But what has he conquered?

507
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:38,521
格勒斯  给他一点时间吧 他还年轻
Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.

508
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:40,899
我觉得他可以做得很好
I think he could do very well.

509
01:03:41,233 --> 01:03:43,193
为了罗马  还是为了你?
For Rome, or for you?

510
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,577
路西亚斯  去你母亲处 她会欢喜的
Go to your mother, Lucius. It's what she'd like.

511
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:01,086
-路西亚斯! -妈妈!
-Lucius! -Mother!

512
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:04,923
凯撒万岁
Hail, Caesar.

513
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,508
参议员
Senators.

514
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:13,056
罗马迎接她的新皇帝
Rome greets her new emperor.

515
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:16,685
你忠心的臣民欢迎你  陛下
Your loyal subjects bid you welcome, Highness.

516
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,603
谢谢  科高
Thank you, Falco.

517
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:22,774
至于忠心的臣民 希望不是太昂贵
And for the loyal subjects, I trust they werert too expensive.

518
01:04:22,858 --> 01:04:24,859
-凯撒 -格勒斯
-Caesar. -Gracchus.

519
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,445
凯撒  全罗马因你的回来而喜悦
All Rome rejoices in your return, Caesar.

520
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:31,032
有很多事情需要你处理
But there are many matters that require your attention.

521
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:36,371
请肃静
To order, please. To order.

522
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,623
凯撒  为了请你指引
For your guidance, Caesar,

523
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,501
议会准备了一系列草案...
the Senate has prepared a series of protocols...

524
01:04:41,585 --> 01:04:44,671
去开始处理市内的很多问题
to begin addressing the many problems in the city,

525
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:48,842
首先是希腊区的基本卫生...
beginning with basic sanitation for the Greek Quarter,

526
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:52,971
要对抗已在那里滋生的瘟疫
to combat the plague which is already springing up there.

527
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,848
所以  如果凯撒...
So, if Caesar...

528
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,893
你明白吗  格勒斯?
Don't you see, Gracchus?

529
01:05:00,312 --> 01:05:02,605
这就是问题所在  不是吗?
That's the very problem, isn't it?

530
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:05,692
我父亲用所有时间...
My father spent all his time at study,

531
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:10,822
去钻研学术及哲理的书籍
at books of learning and philosophy.

532
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:15,326
他临终时还在审阅 议会的奏书
He spent his twilight hours reading scrolls from the Senate.

533
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:19,497
而却一直忘记了人民
And all the while, the people were forgotten.

534
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:22,292
但陛下  议会就是人民
But the senate is the people, sire,

535
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:25,920
从人民选出为人民说话
chosen from among the people to speak for the people.

536
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:30,216
我相信没多少人像你吃得那样好 格勒斯
I doubt many of the people eat so well as you do, Gracchus.

537
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:33,428
或有那么多美丽的女人  佳斯
Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.

538
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:35,597
我明白我的人民
I think I understand my own people.

539
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:39,184
那或者凯撒可以用他丰富的经验...
Then perhaps Caesar will be so good as to teach us,

540
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,228
来教我们
out of his own extensive experience.

541
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:47,650
我称之为爱
I call it love.

542
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:51,362
我是人民的父亲 他们是我孩子
I am their father. The people are my children.

543
01:05:51,655 --> 01:05:54,157
我要紧紧拥抱他们
And I shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly.

544
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:57,702
陛下  你试过拥抱死于瘟疫的人吗?
Have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire?

545
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:06,628
没有  但你再打断我的话...
No, but if you interrupt me again,

546
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,464
我会要你那样做
I assure you that you shall.

547
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:11,883
议员  我哥哥很累了
Senator, my brother is very tired.

548
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:17,055
把议程给我吧 凯撒会做到所有罗马需要的
Leave your list with me. Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.

549
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:22,560
公主陛下 你永远轻轻一句便使我们服从
My lady, as always, your lightest touch commands obedience.

550
01:06:29,693 --> 01:06:31,945
他们有什么资格教训我?
Who are they to lecture me?

551
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,781
卡莫德  议会是有其作用的
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

552
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:37,742
有什么用?他们只是空谈
What uses? All they do is talk.

553
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:43,498
应该只是你和我统治罗马
It should be just you and me and Rome.

554
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:46,918
想也不要想 议会一直存在
Don't even think it. There's always been a Senate.

555
01:06:47,419 --> 01:06:49,087
罗马变了
Rome has changed.

556
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:52,215
需要一个皇帝去统治帝国
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.

557
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,592
当然  但要让人民保留...
Of course, but leave the people their...

558
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,052
假象?
Illusions?

559
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,097
传统
Traditions.

560
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:02,767
我父亲和外族的战争...
My father's war against the barbarians.

561
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:07,021
他自己说的  没有达到什么 但人民爱戴他
He said it himself, it achieved nothing. But the people loved him.

562
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,982
人民永远热爱胜利
The people always love victories.

563
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:12,735
为什么?他们没有看到战事
Why? They didn't see the battles.

564
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:16,030
日耳曼关他们什么事?
What do they care about Germania?

565
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,449
他们想看见罗马的伟大
They care about the greatness of Rome.

566
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,451
"罗马的伟大"
"The greatness of Rome."

567
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:24,205
那是什么?
Well, what is that?

568
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:30,128
伟大是一个概念
It's an idea. Greatness.

569
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:37,302
-伟大是一个理想 -正是  一个理想
-Greatness is a vision. -Exactly. A vision.

570
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:41,347
你明吗  露西娜?
Do you not see, Lucilla?

571
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:46,686
我会给罗马人民一个理想 他们会因此爱戴我
I will give the people a vision of Rome, and they'll love me for it.

572
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:51,733
而他们很快便会忘记 几个老人沉闷的训导
And they'll soon forget the tedious sermonizing of a few dry old men.

573
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:06,456
我会给人民 他们一生中最大的理想
I will give the people the greatest vision of their lives.

574
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:48,790
斗士-暴力

575
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:00,593
有好喝的红酒和白酒!
White and red wine for your drinking pleasure!

576
01:09:08,894 --> 01:09:10,061
竞技
Games.

577
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:15,400
150天的竞技
One hundred and fifty days of games.

578
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:17,443
他比我想像中聪明
He's cleverer than I thought.

579
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:21,072
聪明  如果不是怕了他的禁卫军...
Clever. The whole of Rome would be laughing at him,

580
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:24,158
全罗马都会耻笑他
if they werert so afraid of his Praetorians.

581
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:27,036
恐惧和好奇  很有效的组合
Fear and wonder. A powerful combination.

582
01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:31,582
你以为人民真会被这个诱惑吗?
You really think the people are going to be seduced by that?

583
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:34,752
我觉得他知道罗马是什么 罗马就是群众
I think he knows what Rome is. Rome is the mob.

584
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:38,589
变些戏法便能迷惑他们
Conjure magic for them, and they'll be distracted.

585
01:09:39,174 --> 01:09:42,427
拿走他们的自由 他们依然会大笑
Take away their freedom, and still they'll roar.

586
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:47,348
罗马的心脏不是议会殿
The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate.

587
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,434
而是斗兽场
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

588
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:53,479
他会带给他们死亡...
He'll bring them death,

589
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:57,608
而他们会因此爱戴他
and they will love him for it.

590
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:22,383
你只需杀  杀  杀
All you do is kill, kill, kill.

591
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,886
群众不是要屠夫 他们要英雄
The crowd don't want a butcher, they want a hero.

592
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:27,013
我们要他们不断回来看
We want them to keep coming back.

593
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:31,267
所以不要只顾把他们斩件 记着你是要娱乐观众
So don'tjust hack them to pieces, remember you are an entertainer.

594
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:35,229
西班牙人
Spaniard.

595
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,572
快去娱乐他们!
So entertain!

596
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:53,808
那是娱乐吧?
Are you not entertained? Are you not entertained?

597
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:58,354
你们来不是为了这个吗?
Is this not why you're here?

598
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,987
西班牙人! 西班牙人! 西班牙人!
Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

599
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:25,006
你想要什么?
What do you want?

600
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:28,718
女人?
Girl?

601
01:12:29,761 --> 01:12:30,928
男人?
Boy?

602
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:34,098
-是你叫我来的 -是
-You sent for me. -Yes, I did.

603
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,269
你很好  但不够
You're good, Spaniard, but you're not that good.

604
01:12:38,353 --> 01:12:39,520
你可以很出色
You could be magnificent.

605
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:43,107
需要杀人  所以我去杀 那就够了
I'm required to kill, so I kill. That is enough.

606
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:47,028
对外省区域是够 但不是对罗马
That's enough for the provinces, but not for Rome.

607
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:54,327
那年轻皇帝安排了一系列表演...
The young emperor has arranged a series of spectacles

608
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:58,581
去纪念他的父亲奥利里亚斯
to commemorate his father, Marcus Aurelius.

609
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:01,083
我觉得很有趣...
I find that amusing,

610
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:04,503
因为当初是奥利里亚斯...
since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise,

611
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:08,049
英明博学的奥利里亚斯 禁止了我们
the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius, that closed us down.

612
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:15,181
终于  在穷乡僻坏捱了五年...
So finally, after five years of scratching a living

613
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:17,475
艰苦的生活后
in flea-infested villages,

614
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:20,603
我们终于可以回去 我们所属的地方...
we're finally going back to where we belong.

615
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:22,897
斗兽场
The Colosseum.

616
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:27,944
你应去见识斗兽场
You should see the Colosseum, Spaniard.

617
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:31,322
五万罗马人...
Fifty thousand Romans,

618
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:36,118
看着你挥剑的每一个动作
watching every movement of your sword,

619
01:13:37,537 --> 01:13:40,039
渴望你斩杀对手
willing you to make that killer blow.

620
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:44,835
你挥击前的静默 与之后的狂呼
The silence before you strike and the noise afterwards.

621
01:13:45,837 --> 01:13:49,465
群情不断高涨...
It rises. It rises up,

622
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:52,301
似风暴一样
like a storm.

623
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:55,763
就像你是雷雨神
As if you were the thunder god himself.

624
01:13:55,847 --> 01:13:58,808
-你曾经是斗士? -是的
-You were a gladiator? -Yes, I was.

625
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:07,441
你赢取了自由?
You won your freedom?

626
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:09,860
很久以前  皇帝...
A long time ago, the Emperor

627
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,614
赐了我一把木剑
presented me with a rudius.

628
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:16,409
那只是一把木剑
It's just a wooden sword.

629
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,371
象征了你的自由
The symbol of your freedom.

630
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,543
他碰了我的肩膊 我便自由了
He touched me on the shoulder, and I was free.

631
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,338
你认识奥利里亚斯?
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

632
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:33,676
我没说我认识他 我说他碰了我的肩膊一下
I did not say I knew him. I said he touched me on the shoulder once.

633
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,387
你问我要什么
You asked me what I want.

634
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,683
我亦要站在皇帝面前...
I, too, want to stand in front of the Emperor,

635
01:14:41,935 --> 01:14:43,352
就像你一样
as you did.

636
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:46,856
那听我说  跟我学习
Then listen to me. Learn from me.

637
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:50,776
我是最好的 不是因为我杀得快
I wasrt the best because I killed quickly.

638
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:54,655
而是因为观众喜欢我
I was the best because the crowd loved me.

639
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:59,076
赢取观众的心  你便会赢得自由
Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom.

640
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,416
我会赢到观众的心
I will win the crowd.

641
01:15:07,627 --> 01:15:11,088
我会让他们看到从未看过的
I will give them something they've never seen before.

642
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:15,092
那我们应该一起去罗马...
So, Spaniard, we shall go to Rome together

643
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:17,595
去进行血腥的历险
and have bloody adventures.

644
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,472
那些妓女会喂哺我们...
And the great whore will suckle us

645
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:22,141
直到我们又胖又开心 吃不下为止
until we are fat and happy and can suckle no more.

646
01:15:22,225 --> 01:15:23,684
然后...
And then,

647
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,937
够多人死了后
when enough men have died,

648
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:31,567
或者你会重获自由
perhaps you will have your freedom.

649
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:38,324
来  用这个
Here. Use this.

650
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:05,226
我的国家在那里某处
It's somewhere out there, my country.

651
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:07,645
我的家
My home.

652
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,981
我妻子在准备食物
My wife is preparing food.

653
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:14,652
我的女儿们从河里打水
My daughters carry water from the river.

654
01:16:15,987 --> 01:16:18,030
我会再见到她们吗?
Will I ever see them again?

655
01:16:19,324 --> 01:16:20,825
大概不会
I think, no.

656
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:23,577
你相信你死后会见到她们吗?
Do you believe you'll see them again when you die?

657
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,037
我相信
I think so.

658
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:28,749
但我很快便会死
But then, I will die soon.

659
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:32,837
而她们要过很多年才死
They will not die for many years.

660
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:35,297
我要等
I'll have to wait.

661
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:37,550
但你会等?
But you would? Wait?

662
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:39,552
当然
Of course.

663
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:42,847
你知吗...
You see,

664
01:16:44,015 --> 01:16:47,560
我妻子和儿子...
my wife and my son

665
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,439
已经在等我
are already waiting for me.

666
01:16:51,523 --> 01:16:55,192
你会见到他们  但没那么快
You'll meet them again. But not yet.

667
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:00,614
没那么快
Not yet.

668
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,909
-除非... -没那么快
-Unless... -Not yet.

669
01:17:07,914 --> 01:17:09,206
没那么快
Not yet.

670
01:17:22,095 --> 01:17:23,637
他在那里
There he is.

671
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:13,896
出去
Out.

672
01:18:15,106 --> 01:18:17,024
快行  出去!
Move, go, out!

673
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:32,248
再见到你真好  老友
Good to see you again, old friend.

674
01:18:37,587 --> 01:18:39,296
请带给我幸运
Bring me fortune.

675
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:46,762
你有没见过像这样的东西?
Have you ever seen anything like that before?

676
01:18:47,847 --> 01:18:50,432
我不知道人可以建造出来
I didn't know men could build such things.

677
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:01,986
赢取群众的心
Win the crowd.

678
01:19:02,195 --> 01:19:04,530
进去  快
Get inside. Move.

679
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:05,906
进去
Inside.

680
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:57,875
他睡得那样好因为有人爱他
He sleeps so well because he's loved.

681
01:20:00,795 --> 01:20:02,880
来  哥哥  很夜了
Come, brother. It's late.

682
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:09,303
我会令罗马成为历代神话
I will make Rome the wonder of the ages.

683
01:20:12,098 --> 01:20:15,434
那是格勒斯和他的朋友们 不会明白的
That is what Gracchus and his friends don't understand.

684
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:19,063
我的所有欲望正在把我撕裂
All my desires are splitting my head to pieces.

685
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:28,864
卡莫德  喝这药剂
Commodus, drink this tonic.

686
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:40,876
我觉得时候差不多了
I think the time is almost right.

687
01:20:41,252 --> 01:20:44,171
我可以在纪念父亲的庆祝会上...
I could announce the dissolution of the Senate

688
01:20:44,255 --> 01:20:46,340
宣布解散国会
at the celebration to honor our father.

689
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:48,384
你认为我应该吗?
Do you think I should?

690
01:20:49,135 --> 01:20:51,053
人民准备好没有?
Are the people ready?

691
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:55,557
我觉得你现在需要休息
I think you need your rest now.

692
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:03,315
你会陪着我吗?
Will you stay with me?

693
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,818
依然怕黑吗  哥哥?
Still afraid of the dark, brother?

694
01:21:12,575 --> 01:21:13,784
依然
Still.

695
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:16,912
永远
Always.

696
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:21,500
-今晚陪我 -你知我不会
-Stay with me tonight. -You know I won't.

697
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:27,506
那吻我
Then kiss me.

698
01:21:36,307 --> 01:21:37,850
睡吧
Sleep, brother.

699
01:22:30,653 --> 01:22:32,780
有又聋又哑的仆人...
Having servants who are deaf and mute

700
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:35,616
至少让我活得久一点
at least ensures I live a little longer.

701
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:39,745
他们在拘捕学者
They're arresting scholars now.

702
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:43,665
任何敢表达意见的 甚至包括作者和史记者
Anyone who dare speak out. Even satirists and chroniclers.

703
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,210
还有数学家
And mathematicians.

704
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:49,546
全部喂斗兽场
And all to feed the arena.

705
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:53,634
国会没有通过战争法例
The Senate did not approve martial law.

706
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:56,553
这全是禁卫军的恐怖势力
This reign of terror is entirely the Praetorians.

707
01:22:57,722 --> 01:22:59,848
我入黑后不敢外出
I'm afraid to go out after dark.

708
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:03,477
你更应担心日间的活动
You should be more afraid of your activities during the day.

709
01:23:03,561 --> 01:23:08,273
国会中布满他的线眼 由那好色的科高带领
The Senate is full of his spies, led by that whore master, Falco.

710
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:14,029
究竟他在想什么? 那是最令我困惑的
But what is in his mind? That's what I trouble myselfwith.

711
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,741
他整天只顾...
He spends all his days singularly obsessed,

712
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,661
筹划你父亲的纪念庆典
planning the festival to honor your father.

713
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:24,331
他连政府最基本的工作也忽略
He neglects even the most fundamental task of government.

714
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:27,292
他到底在计划什么?
So just what is he planning?

715
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:29,294
用什么来支付?
And what pays for it?

716
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:33,590
每天这些竞技支出庞大 但我们没加新税项
These daily games are costing a fortune, yet we have no new taxes.

717
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:35,759
未来
The future.

718
01:23:37,136 --> 01:23:39,179
用未来支付
The future pays for it.

719
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,517
他已开始卖谷物贮备
He's started selling the grain reserves.

720
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:45,435
不是吧
This can't be true.

721
01:23:46,062 --> 01:23:48,564
他在卖罗马贮备的谷物
He's selling Rome's reserves of grain.

722
01:23:49,148 --> 01:23:52,067
人民在两年后便会捱饿
The people will be starving in two years.

723
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:54,111
希望他们享受...
I hope they're enjoying the games,

724
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:57,573
那些竞技 因为不久他们便会因此而灭亡
because soon enough they'll be dead because of them.

725
01:23:57,907 --> 01:24:00,242
-罗马人要知道真相 -怎样?
-Rome must know this. -And how?

726
01:24:00,743 --> 01:24:03,120
他打算解散国会
He's going to dissolve the Senate.

727
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:07,291
谁会及时告诉他们? 你  格勒斯?
And who will tell them before it's too late? You, Gracchus?

728
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:10,127
你  佳斯
You, Gaius.

729
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:13,755
你会否在国会上指责我哥哥?
Will you make a speech on the floor of the Senate,denouncing my brother?

730
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:16,842
然后看着你全家被推进斗兽场?
And then see your family in the Colosseum?

731
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:19,177
谁敢?
Who'd dare?

732
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:31,398
我每天都活在恐惧中...
I have been living in a prison of fear every day,

733
01:24:31,482 --> 01:24:34,067
因为我儿子是皇位继承人
because my son is heir to the throne.

734
01:24:39,657 --> 01:24:41,158
他一定要死
He must die.

735
01:24:45,496 --> 01:24:49,291
但昆特斯和禁卫军会夺去控制权
Quintus and the Praetorians would simply seize control for themselves.

736
01:24:49,375 --> 01:24:53,253
不  把蛇头斩了 便不能袭击人
No. Cut off the head and the snake cannot strike.

737
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:55,380
露西娜  佳斯说得对
Lucilla, Gaius is right.

738
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:59,593
不能压制禁卫军的话 我们不会成功
Until we can neutralize the Praetorians, we can achieve nothing.

739
01:25:01,137 --> 01:25:02,638
那我们坐以待毙?
So we do nothing?

740
01:25:02,722 --> 01:25:05,515
不  我们在暗中计划
No, child. We keep our counsel.

741
01:25:06,517 --> 01:25:07,851
我们准备
We prepare.

742
01:25:08,686 --> 01:25:13,482
人民支持他 我们的声音便没有力量
As long as the people support him, we are voices without steel.

743
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:15,692
我们是空气
We are air.

744
01:25:18,696 --> 01:25:21,490
但每天他都在竖敌
But with every day that passes, he makes enemies.

745
01:25:21,574 --> 01:25:24,451
终有一天  他的敌人会多过朋友
One day, he'll have more enemies than friends.

746
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:27,829
那就是我们行动的时候
And on that day, we will act.

747
01:25:28,414 --> 01:25:30,290
那时我们便反击
Then we will strike.

748
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:32,960
在那刻来临前...
But until then,

749
01:25:34,128 --> 01:25:35,712
我们是听话的
we are docile.

750
01:25:36,172 --> 01:25:38,340
我们是服从的
We are obedient.

751
01:25:39,926 --> 01:25:41,927
而我们亦是不忠的
And we are treacherous.

752
01:25:50,561 --> 01:25:51,728
快!
Come on!

753
01:26:00,571 --> 01:26:02,614
好了  够了
All right, that's enough.

754
01:26:25,179 --> 01:26:26,513
皇帝要战争
The Emperor wants battles,

755
01:26:26,597 --> 01:26:28,765
而我不想牺牲我最好的战士
and I don't want to sacrifice my best fighters.

756
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:32,185
观众想看战争 所以皇帝给他们看
The crowd wants battles, so the Emperor gives them battles.

757
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:35,856
-你已有迦太基之役 -是迦太基大屠杀
-You get the battle of Can'thage. -Massacre of Can'thage.

758
01:26:37,817 --> 01:26:39,234
那你为什么不去监狱
Well, why don't you go down to the prison,

759
01:26:39,318 --> 01:26:41,319
抓乞丐和盗贼?
round up all the beggars and thieves?

760
01:26:41,404 --> 01:26:42,571
我们做了
We've done that.

761
01:26:42,655 --> 01:26:46,283
如果你想要全帝国最好的斗士
If you want to give away the best gladiators in the whole of the empire,

762
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:48,493
我要双倍价钱
then I want double the rates.

763
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:52,372
你不接受合约价钱 我们就取消合约
You'll get your contract rates, or you'll get your contract canceled.

764
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:53,874
不满意吗?
You don't like it?

765
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:57,919
那爬回去你出来的屎洞吧
Then you can crawl back down that shit hole that you came from.

766
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:03,175
卡西亚  求你 你可以放了我们
Cassius, please. You can free us.

767
01:27:32,997 --> 01:27:36,124
你是不是那个 他们叫西班牙人的斗士?
Gladiator, are you the one they call the Spaniard?

768
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:37,334
是的
Yes.

769
01:27:38,127 --> 01:27:40,337
他们说你是巨人
They said you were a giant.

770
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:43,590
他们说你能单手 握碎一个男人的头骨
They said you could crush a mars skull with one hand.

771
01:27:43,674 --> 01:27:45,425
男人?  不能
A mars? No.

772
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:48,095
男孩吧
A boy's.

773
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:53,642
-西班牙有好马匹吗? -其中最好的
-Do they have good horses in Spain? -Some of the best.

774
01:27:54,685 --> 01:27:57,771
这是亚尊图  这是史加图
This is Argento and this is Scan'to.

775
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:00,982
它们是我的马
They were my horses.

776
01:28:01,901 --> 01:28:03,985
它们被带走了
They were taken from me.

777
01:28:04,278 --> 01:28:07,572
我喜欢你  我会为你打气
I like you, Spaniard. I shall cheer for you.

778
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:11,451
-他们让你看竞技? -我舅父说那会令我坚强
-They let you watch the games? -My uncle says it makes me strong.

779
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:14,830
-那你父亲怎样说? -我父亲死了
-And what does your father say? -My father is dead.

780
01:28:16,582 --> 01:28:18,667
路西亚斯主人  时间到了
Master Lucius, it is time.

781
01:28:19,919 --> 01:28:21,294
我要走了
I have to go.

782
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,963
你叫路西亚斯?
Your name is Lucius?

783
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:27,759
路西亚斯维里斯  以纪念我父亲
Lucius Verus, after my father.

784
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:00,125
放下!
Lower!

785
01:29:05,256 --> 01:29:08,175
-哥地亚斯! -是?
-Claudius! -Yes?

786
01:29:08,259 --> 01:29:10,677
-多些盾牌!  -好的
-More shields! -All right.

787
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:34,534
当皇上进场时 高举武器  向他敬礼...
When the Emperor enters, raise your weapons, salute him,

788
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:36,661
然后齐声说话
and then speak together.

789
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:40,957
面向皇上 不准背向他
Face the Emperor and don't turn your back on him.

790
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:44,920
去吧  要死得光荣
Go, and die with honor.

791
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:42,060
全能的凯撒万岁!
Hail, mighty Caesar!

792
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:49,526
凯撒!
-Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! -Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

我们回到神圣的古代
we reach back to hallowed antiquity

796
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:07,085
重演迦太基的...

797
01:31:07,169 --> 01:31:09,212
第二次失陷!
of mighty Can'thage!

798
01:31:12,925 --> 01:31:17,345
在贫瘠的莎玛平原上
On the barren plain of Zama

799
01:31:17,972 --> 01:31:21,057
站着了异族人汉尼拔...

800
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:24,060
的无敌军队
of the barbarian Hannibal.

801
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:27,939
来自野蛮国家的...
Ferocious mercenaries and warriors

802
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:30,400
凶残雇佣兵和战士...

803
01:31:30,484 --> 01:31:34,779
屈服于无情的毁灭性...

皇上很高兴献给你们...
Your emperor is pleased to give you

806
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:45,123
野蛮民族

807
01:31:53,466 --> 01:31:55,467
有没有人当过军?

有  我在云度邦拿跟过你

你可以帮我
You can help me.

810
01:32:02,391 --> 01:32:04,934
不论从闸里走出来的是什么...
Whatever comes out of these gates,

811
01:32:05,686 --> 01:32:09,481
我们要合作才能增加生存机会
we've got a better chance of survival ifwe work together.

812
01:32:09,565 --> 01:32:11,274
你明白吗?

813
01:32:13,402 --> 01:32:15,445
我们靠在一起  就能生存
Lfwe stay together, we survive.

814

皇上献给你们 史基比奥的...

816
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:34,839
战死为止!
To the death!

817
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:41,221
杀!

锁紧盾牌  靠在一起

靠稳  蹲低!

我们胜了!
We win!

835
01:36:42,713 --> 01:36:45,214
我对历史有点模糊  卡西亚...
My history's a little hazy, Cassius,

836
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:48,968
但那些野蛮人 不是输了迦太基之役吗?
but shouldn't the barbarians lose the battle of Can'thage?

837
01:36:49,053 --> 01:36:50,803
是的  陛下
Yes, sire.

838
01:36:52,723 --> 01:36:54,098
请见谅  陛下
Forgive me, sire.

839
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:56,893
没关系  我享受惊喜
No, I rather enjoy surprises.

840
01:36:57,686 --> 01:36:58,811
他是谁?
Who is he?

841
01:36:58,896 --> 01:37:01,898
他们叫他做西班牙人  陛下
They call him the Spaniard, sire.

842
01:37:04,401 --> 01:37:06,319
我想会见他
I think I'll meet him.

843
01:37:06,403 --> 01:37:07,737
是  陛下
Yes, sire.

844
01:37:09,948 --> 01:37:11,866
野蛮人万岁!
Hail to the barbarians!

845
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:30,218
前进!准备武器!
Forward! Arms at ready!

846
01:37:43,774 --> 01:37:45,441
丢低武器
Drop your weapons.

847
01:37:49,446 --> 01:37:52,407
斗士  皇上要见你
Gladiator, the Emperor has asked for you.

848
01:37:52,991 --> 01:37:55,243
我愿为皇上效力
I am at the Emperor's service.

849
01:38:21,937 --> 01:38:24,063
起来
Rise. Rise.

850
01:38:33,407 --> 01:38:35,658
你果然名不虚传  西班牙人
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard.

851
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:38,244
你应该是史上最好的斗士
I don't think there's ever been a gladiator to match you.

852
01:38:38,328 --> 01:38:41,247
这小伙子坚说你是赫克托再生
As for this young man, he insists you are Hector reborn.

853
01:38:41,331 --> 01:38:42,915
还是海克力士?
Or was it Hercules?

854
01:38:44,334 --> 01:38:48,171
为什么大英雄不现出真面目 和告知他的真名?
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself and tell us all your real name?

855
01:38:50,215 --> 01:38:51,841
你有名字的吧
You do have a name.

856
01:38:52,634 --> 01:38:54,510
我名字叫斗士
My name is Gladiator.

857
01:38:57,806 --> 01:39:00,975
你竟敢背向我?奴隶!
How dare you show your back to me? Slave!

858
01:39:02,352 --> 01:39:05,688
你立即除下头盔和说出名字
You will remove your helmet and tell me your name.

859
01:39:17,451 --> 01:39:19,952
我名字是麦克西马米里迪亚
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius,

860
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:22,288
北军总指挥
commander of the armies of the north,

861
01:39:22,372 --> 01:39:24,707
菲历斯军团的将军
general of the Felix Legions,

862
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:28,085
真皇帝奥利里亚斯的忠心侍从
loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius,

863
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:31,672
一个儿子被杀的父亲
father to a murdered son,

864
01:39:32,132 --> 01:39:34,425
一个妻子被杀的丈夫
husband to a murdered wife,

865
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:38,513
而我会为他们报仇 今世或来世
and I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.

866
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:46,896
准备武器!
Arms!

867
01:39:59,993 --> 01:40:03,329
让他活! 活! 活! 活!
Live! Live! Live! Live!

868
01:40:03,413 --> 01:40:06,624
-活! 活! 活! 活!  -活! 活! 活! 活!
-Live! Live! Live! Live! -Live! Live! Live! Live!

869
01:40:50,627 --> 01:40:53,337
放下武器!
Arms, at rest!

870
01:41:45,849 --> 01:41:50,311
-麦克西马! 麦克西马! 麦克西马! -麦克西马! 麦克西马!麦克西马!
-Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! -Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

871
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:39,568
父亲
Father.

872
01:43:53,935 --> 01:43:55,811
他为何还活着?
Why is he still alive?

873
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:58,564
我不知道
I don't know.

874
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:00,649
他应该死了的
He shouldn't be alive.

875
01:44:01,485 --> 01:44:02,902
那令我气恼
It vexes me.

876
01:44:04,654 --> 01:44:06,447
我非常气恼
I'm terribly vexed.

877
01:44:17,667 --> 01:44:19,585
我一定要那样做
I did what I had to do.

878
01:44:20,337 --> 01:44:24,381
如果照父亲意思 这帝国便会四分五裂了
If Father had had his way, the empire would have been torn apart.

879
01:44:24,466 --> 01:44:26,133
你明白吧
You do see that.

880
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:27,676
是的
Yes.

881
01:44:32,474 --> 01:44:35,684
你见到他时有什么感觉?
What did you feel when you saw him?

882
01:44:37,813 --> 01:44:39,438
没有感觉
I felt nothing.

883
01:44:41,399 --> 01:44:43,943
他深深的伤害了你  不是吗?
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

884
01:44:44,986 --> 01:44:47,196
不会多过我伤害他
No more than I wounded him.

885
01:44:51,701 --> 01:44:53,994
他们在日耳曼是骗了我
They lied to me in Germania.

886
01:44:55,622 --> 01:44:57,706
他们说他已经死了
They told me he was dead.

887
01:44:59,709 --> 01:45:02,294
他们骗我  即是不尊重我
If they lie to me, they don't respect me.

888
01:45:02,379 --> 01:45:05,714
他们不尊重我  又怎会爱戴我?
If they don't respect me, how can they ever love me?

889
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:09,426
那你便要让军团知道...
Then you must let the legions know

890
01:45:09,511 --> 01:45:12,596
他们的叛逆会得到惩罚
their treachery will not go unpunished.

891
01:45:13,431 --> 01:45:14,890
可怜的妹妹
Poor sister.

892
01:45:15,308 --> 01:45:17,768
我不想做你的敌人
I wouldn't want to be your enemy.

893
01:45:18,979 --> 01:45:20,729
你会怎做?
What will you do?

894
01:45:33,702 --> 01:45:35,035
这边
This way.

895
01:46:10,405 --> 01:46:13,866
富有的女士会付高价 给最英勇的斗士
Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions.

896
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:16,452
我知道你哥哥会派刺客
I knew your brother would send assassins.

897
01:46:16,953 --> 01:46:19,580
我没想过他会派最好的
I didn't realize he would send his best.

898
01:46:21,207 --> 01:46:23,292
麦克西马  他不知道我来
Maximus, he doesn't know.

899
01:46:24,252 --> 01:46:27,379
我家人活生生被吊和烧死
My family was burnt and crucified while they were still alive.

900
01:46:27,464 --> 01:46:30,007
-我全不知情 -不要骗我!
-I knew nothing... -Don't lie to me!

901
01:46:36,473 --> 01:46:38,223
我为他们哭泣
I wept for them.

902
01:46:38,308 --> 01:46:42,144
就像你为你父亲哭泣?
As you wept for your father? As you wept for your father?

903
01:46:42,228 --> 01:46:45,814
我自那天起便活在恐惧中
I have been living in a prison of fear since that day.

904
01:46:46,316 --> 01:46:50,152
为了对兄长的恐惧 而不能哀悼父亲
To be unable to mourn your father for fear of your brother.

905
01:46:51,029 --> 01:46:54,239
因为儿子是皇位继承人...
To live in terror every moment of every day,

906
01:46:54,324 --> 01:46:57,117
而每一刻都活在恐惧中
because your son is heir to the throne.

907
01:46:58,995 --> 01:47:00,454
我有哭过
I have wept.

908
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:04,625
我儿子是无辜的
My son was innocent.

909
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:07,503
我的也是
So is mine.

910
01:47:09,506 --> 01:47:12,591
是否要我儿子死了 你才会信我?
Must my son die, too, before you'll trust me?

911
01:47:14,052 --> 01:47:17,012
我信不信你又有什么关系?
What does it matter if I trust you or not?

912
01:47:17,889 --> 01:47:20,933
上天放过了你 你明白吗?
The gods have spared you. Don't you understand?

913
01:47:21,017 --> 01:47:24,478
今天我看见了一个奴隶 比罗马皇帝更有势力
Today I saw a slave become more powerful than the emperor of Rome.

914
01:47:24,562 --> 01:47:26,355
上天放过了我?
The gods have spared me?

915
01:47:26,439 --> 01:47:29,900
我靠别人怜悯 只有能力娱乐一堆群众
I am at their mercy, with the power only to amuse a mob.

916
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:31,527
那就是势力
That is power.

917
01:47:32,028 --> 01:47:33,153
群众正是罗马
The mob is Rome.

918
01:47:33,238 --> 01:47:36,865
当卡莫德控制他们 他便控制了所有
And while Commodus controls them, he controls everything.

919
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:38,742
听我说
Listen to me.

920
01:47:39,285 --> 01:47:42,413
我哥哥有很多敌人 尤其在国会里
My brother has enemies, most of all in the Senate.

921
01:47:42,497 --> 01:47:44,748
但大家都跟随他...
But while the people follow him,

922
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:47,876
没人敢顶撞他 直至你出现
no one would dare stand up to him until you.

923
01:47:48,837 --> 01:47:51,130
他们反对他  但什么也不做
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.

924
01:47:51,214 --> 01:47:54,967
有些政客把一生奉献给罗马
There are some politicians who have dedicated their lives to Rome.

925
01:47:55,051 --> 01:47:56,802
尤其有一位
One man above all.

926
01:47:57,887 --> 01:48:00,973
如果我安排  你愿意见他吗?
If I can arrange it, will you meet him?

927
01:48:01,307 --> 01:48:03,225
你不明白吗?
Do you not understand?

928
01:48:03,476 --> 01:48:07,688
我可能今晚便死在这里 或明天在场上  我是奴隶!
I may die in this cell tonight, or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!

929
01:48:07,772 --> 01:48:10,441
我可以做什么?
What possible difference can I make?

930
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:12,985
这人跟你想要的一样
This man wants what you want.

931
01:48:13,069 --> 01:48:15,279
那叫他杀了卡莫德!
Then have him kill Commodus!

932
01:48:17,907 --> 01:48:19,700
我曾经认识一个人...
I knew a man once,

933
01:48:20,618 --> 01:48:21,910
他高尚...
a noble man.

934
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:25,789
有原则  爱我父亲...
A man of principle who loved my father,

935
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:28,834
而我父亲也爱他
and my father loved him.

936
01:48:30,795 --> 01:48:32,963
他全心为罗马服务
This man served Rome well.

937
01:48:37,302 --> 01:48:39,011
那人不在了
That man is gone.

938
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:42,306
你哥哥做得很好
Your brother did his work well.

939
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:44,058
让我帮你
Let me help you.

940
01:48:49,981 --> 01:48:53,067
是  你可以帮我
Yes, you can help me.

941
01:48:56,404 --> 01:49:00,115
忘记你认识过我 永不要再来
Forget you ever knew me, never come here again.

942
01:49:03,787 --> 01:49:06,538
守卫!我们谈完了
Guard! The lady is finished with me.

943
01:49:34,984 --> 01:49:36,652
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

944
01:49:39,656 --> 01:49:41,240
朱利安克拉苏
Julian Crassus.

945
01:49:46,746 --> 01:49:47,996
名字?
Name?

946
01:49:49,290 --> 01:49:50,791
马可斯  陛下
Marcus, sire.

947
01:49:51,709 --> 01:49:53,418
跟我父亲同名
My father's name.

948
01:50:00,927 --> 01:50:03,095
他们发现那四个尸体时
They must have known of Maximus' escape,

949
01:50:03,179 --> 01:50:06,014
一定知道麦克西马逃走了
when they found the bodies of the four men.

950
01:50:06,474 --> 01:50:09,059
他们以为是野蛮人突袭
They thought it was a barbarian raid.

951
01:50:10,103 --> 01:50:13,272
他们是好人  陛下 他们忠于皇上
These are good men, sire. Loyal to the Emperor.

952
01:50:20,613 --> 01:50:22,322
搭箭!
Load your arrows!

953
01:50:29,956 --> 01:50:31,874
准备放箭!
Prepare to fire!

954
01:50:52,395 --> 01:50:55,689
又或者是你知道...
Then perhaps it was you who knew,

955
01:50:56,524 --> 01:50:58,233
而不告诉我
and never told me.

956
01:50:58,484 --> 01:51:00,736
-我并不知道 -你不知道?
-I didn't know. -You didn't know?

957
01:51:02,238 --> 01:51:05,073
但将军永远有控制权
But a general is always in control.

958
01:51:06,451 --> 01:51:10,120
永远是命令者  不是吗?
Always in command, isn't he?

959
01:51:11,664 --> 01:51:13,123
是的  凯撒
Yes, Caesar.

960
01:51:27,055 --> 01:51:29,765
那下命令吧  快说
Then give the command. Say it.

961
01:51:46,658 --> 01:51:47,783
放箭
Fire.

962
01:52:23,027 --> 01:52:24,361
麦克西马
Maximus.

963
01:52:25,113 --> 01:52:28,240
你指挥过军队? 你打过胜仗?
You commanded legions? You had many victories?

964
01:52:29,117 --> 01:52:31,326
-是的 -在日耳曼?
-Yes. -In Germania?

965
01:52:33,246 --> 01:52:34,997
在很多国家
In many countries.

966
01:52:36,582 --> 01:52:37,916
将军
General.

967
01:53:27,008 --> 01:53:28,884
你有很好的声誉
You have a great name.

968
01:53:30,386 --> 01:53:33,430
他一定要破坏你的声誉才能杀你
He must kill your name before he kills you.

969
01:53:42,398 --> 01:53:43,732
是  在远处
Yes, at the far end.

970
01:53:43,816 --> 01:53:45,734
-佳斯议员 -你好
-Senator Gaius. -Hello.

971
01:53:46,235 --> 01:53:48,195
格勒斯议员
Senator Gracchus.

972
01:53:49,781 --> 01:53:53,200
不常见到你享受这些粗野的群众
Don't often see you enjoying the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.

973
01:53:53,284 --> 01:53:56,411
我不假装是民众的一份子  议员
I don't pretend to be a man of the people, Senator,

974
01:53:56,496 --> 01:53:59,039
但我为人民服务
but I do try to be a man for the people.

975
01:54:15,264 --> 01:54:20,519
凯撒!
-Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! -Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

976
01:54:25,024 --> 01:54:26,650
罗马的人民!

989
01:55:39,056 --> 01:55:41,850
这个不是

990
01:55:41,934 --> 01:55:44,769
奥利里亚斯死了  麦克西马

我应怎样处置你?

你总是不死
You simply won't die.

1013
02:01:30,241 --> 02:01:32,617
你和我是那样不同吗?

1014
02:01:33,744 --> 02:01:36,663
你在必要时会杀人  我也是

像妓女般呻吟...

1021
02:02:11,866 --> 02:02:16,411
当他们蹂躏她一次又一次...
when they ravaged her again and again

1022
02:02:17,746 --> 02:02:19,163
又一次
and again.

1023
02:02:24,420 --> 02:02:28,172
你的荣耀很快便会完结
The time for honoring yourself will soon be at an end,

1024
02:02:32,761 --> 02:02:34,137
陛下

1025
02:03:01,665 --> 02:03:07,462

我告诉他我会很快见到他

1037
02:04:25,165 --> 02:04:28,751
还有骑马时脚跟向下

1038
02:04:30,045 --> 02:04:31,546
跟我妻子...
To my wife,

1039
02:04:34,049 --> 02:04:36,175
不关你事
that is not your business.

1040
02:04:43,851 --> 02:04:46,728
现在他们爱戴麦克西马的仁慈
And now they love Maximus for his mercy.

1041
02:04:48,105 --> 02:04:51,649
令我不能就这样杀他 不然我看来更残酷
So I can'tjust kill him, or it makes me even more unmerciful.

1042
02:04:52,985 --> 02:04:57,238
整件事就像一个恶梦
The whole thing is like some great nightmare.

1043
02:04:58,490 --> 02:05:00,324
他在向你挑战
He is defying you.

1044
02:05:00,409 --> 02:05:03,786
他每次胜利都是在挑战你
His every victory is an act of defiance.

1045
02:05:03,871 --> 02:05:07,457
群众见到  国会也见到
The mob sees this, and so do the Senate.

1046
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:11,127
他每活多一天 他们就更大胆
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.

1047
02:05:12,671 --> 02:05:14,422
-杀了他 -不
-Kill him. -No.

1048
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:18,760
我不会让他做烈士
I will not make a martyr of him.

1049
02:05:25,893 --> 02:05:28,352
我今天去国会...
When I went to the Senate today,

1050
02:05:28,437 --> 02:05:32,899
特意告诉他们 我用了谷物贮备来支付竞技赛
I purposefully told them about using the grain reserves to pay for the games.

1051
02:05:34,818 --> 02:05:36,986
你记得发生什么事吗?
And did you note what happened?

1052
02:05:37,071 --> 02:05:40,281
-没什么 -对  什么都没发生
-Nothing. -Exactly. Nothing.

1053
02:05:41,283 --> 02:05:43,618
一句抗议都没有
Not a single word of protest.

1054
02:05:43,702 --> 02:05:47,330
连傲慢的格勒斯议员也没出声
Even the insolent Senator Gracchus was silent as a mouse.

1055
02:05:47,414 --> 02:05:48,581
为什么?
Why?

1056
02:05:50,292 --> 02:05:54,003
我听说有一种海蛇
I have been told of a certain sea snake

1057
02:05:54,088 --> 02:05:58,132
有种特别的方法吸引猎物
which has a very unusual method of attracting its prey.

1058
02:05:58,592 --> 02:06:02,303
它会像受了伤一样躺在海底
It will lie at the bottom of the ocean as ifwounded.

1059
02:06:03,263 --> 02:06:05,598
然后敌人接近...
Then its enemies will approach,

1060
02:06:05,682 --> 02:06:08,768
而它继续躺着不动
and yet it will lie quite still.

1061
02:06:09,103 --> 02:06:12,897
然后敌人会一点一点的咬它...
And then its enemies will take little bites of it,

1062
02:06:12,981 --> 02:06:16,275
但它依然不动
and yet it remains still.

1063
02:06:19,488 --> 02:06:20,655
所以...
So,

1064
02:06:21,990 --> 02:06:23,783
我们要不动...
we will lie still,

1065
02:06:24,493 --> 02:06:27,829
让敌人来咬
and let our enemies come to us and nibble.

1066
02:06:28,997 --> 02:06:31,249
令每个议员也跟着
Have every senator followed.

1067
02:06:48,892 --> 02:06:50,643
西赛罗  老友
Cicero, my old friend.

1068
02:06:50,727 --> 02:06:52,603
我以为以后再见不到你
I thought perhaps I'd seen you for the last time.

1069
02:06:52,688 --> 02:06:55,231
-我以为你死了 -差点
-I thought you were dead. -Close.

1070
02:06:55,315 --> 02:06:56,941
士兵们在奥斯提亚多久了?
How long have the men been in Ostia?

1071
02:06:57,025 --> 02:06:58,359
整个冬天了
All winter.

1072
02:06:58,694 --> 02:07:01,988
-他们看来怎样? -又肥又闷
-And how do they look? -Fat and bored.

1073
02:07:02,698 --> 02:07:05,741
-谁在指挥? -某个罗马来的蠢材
-Who's in command? -Some fool from Rome.

1074
02:07:07,369 --> 02:07:09,203
你认为他们何时会准备好战斗?
How soon do you think they could be ready to fight?

1075
02:07:09,288 --> 02:07:11,080
为了你  明天便行
For you, tomorrow.

1076
02:07:12,541 --> 02:07:15,042
我要你为我做一件事
I need you to do something for me.

1077
02:07:19,673 --> 02:07:21,090
来  看
Come, see, witness.

1078
02:07:21,175 --> 02:07:24,218
如果你未进过场 你可在这里看表演
If you haven't been in the arena, you can see the show here.

1079
02:07:24,303 --> 02:07:27,930
巨人麦克西马在击败我们的皇帝卡莫德
Giant Maximus is defeating our emperor, Commodus.

1080
02:07:28,015 --> 02:07:30,641
我们怎算? 他在挑战所有人...
What are we to do? He's just defying everyone,

1081
02:07:30,726 --> 02:07:32,393
因他挑战他
by doing this to him, they do...

1082
02:07:33,645 --> 02:07:34,979
天呀!
My goodness!

1083
02:07:36,773 --> 02:07:40,359
-他打中他  他被击败了 -让路!
-He got him, he's defeated. -Give way!

02:07:54,416 --> 02:07:57,627
我还侍奉麦克西马将军 我依然侍奉他
And I served General Maximus. I serve him still.

1089
02:07:59,129 --> 02:08:00,713
停下来  停下来
Stop. Stop.

1090
02:08:01,256 --> 02:08:02,423
停下来
Stop!

1091

希望我今天来已证明了...
I hope my coming here today is evidence enough

1098

你能信任我

是的  我代表他们
Yes. I can speak for them.

1101
02:09:06,321 --> 02:09:09,657
你能还我自由和运我出罗马?
You can buy my freedom and smuggle me out of Rome?

1102
02:09:10,033 --> 02:09:11,492
去到哪里?
To what end?

1103
02:09:12,953 --> 02:09:15,288
带我出了城墙
Get me outside the city walls.

Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia. My army is encamped there.

1110
02:09:32,681 --> 02:09:36,017
一百年来没有罗马军队进过首都
No Roman army has entered the capital in 100 years.

1111

I will not trade one dictatorship for another!

1112
02:09:38,437 --> 02:09:41,981
议员  折衷和空谈的时间过去了
The time for half measures and talk is over, Senator.

1113
02:09:42,524 --> 02:09:45,609
那你完成了辉煌的政变后  又怎样?
And after your glorious coup, what then?

1114
02:09:46,820 --> 02:09:50,448
你会带你的五千战士离去?
You'll take your 5,000 warriors and leave?

1115
02:09:50,532 --> 02:09:52,074
我会离开
I will leave.

1116
02:09:52,576 --> 02:09:54,618
士兵会留下保护你们
The soldiers will stay for your protection,

1117
02:09:54,703 --> 02:09:56,370
听命于议会
under the command of the Senate.

1118
02:09:56,496 --> 02:09:57,663
那...
So,

1119
02:09:57,998 --> 02:10:02,209
罗马到了你手上 你会就这样把它还给人民?
once all of Rome is yours, you'll just give it back to the people?

1120
02:10:03,587 --> 02:10:04,587
告诉我为什么
Tell me why.

1121
02:10:10,719 --> 02:10:13,888
因为那是一个人的遗愿
Because that was the last wish of a dying man.

1122
02:10:16,933 --> 02:10:18,809
我会杀了卡莫德
I will kill Commodus.

1123
02:10:20,729 --> 02:10:23,814
罗马的命运就交给你了
The fate of Rome I leave to you.

1124
02:10:25,567 --> 02:10:27,860
奥利里亚斯信任你
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1125
02:10:29,696 --> 02:10:31,739
他的女儿信任你
His daughter trusts you.

1126
02:10:35,744 --> 02:10:37,411
我都会信任你
I will trust you.

1127
02:10:37,829 --> 02:10:39,872
但我们时间紧逼
But we have little time.

1128
02:10:40,415 --> 02:10:42,166
给我两天...
Give me two days,

1129
02:10:42,959 --> 02:10:45,211
我会买下你的自由
and I will buy your freedom.

1130
02:10:45,837 --> 02:10:47,171
而你...
And you,

1131
02:10:48,715 --> 02:10:50,299
你要继续生存...
you stay alive,

1132
02:10:51,802 --> 02:10:53,469
不然我就会死
or I'll be dead.

1133
02:10:55,430 --> 02:10:57,014
我们要走了
Now we must go.

1134
02:11:24,084 --> 02:11:27,670
他会在等你 站在斗兽场脚下
He'll be waiting for you. Stand at the foot of the colossus.

1135
02:11:27,754 --> 02:11:29,338
他会找到你
He'll find you.

1136
02:12:13,508 --> 02:12:14,967
不会成功的
It won't work.

1137
02:12:15,927 --> 02:12:18,053
皇帝知道太多了
The Emperor knows too much.

1138
02:12:18,805 --> 02:12:19,805
对我来说...
And as for me,

1139
02:12:22,142 --> 02:12:24,185
变得太危险了
it's becoming dangerous.

1140
02:12:25,478 --> 02:12:27,730
我回来时会付钱给你
You'll be paid on my return.

1141
02:12:29,816 --> 02:12:31,609
我向你承诺
I give you my word.

1142
02:12:31,860 --> 02:12:34,945
承诺?若你不回来呢?
Your word? What if you don't return?

1143
02:12:36,198 --> 02:12:39,158
你记得信任是什么吗  朴森姆?
Do you remember what it was to have trust, Proximo?

1144
02:12:39,242 --> 02:12:40,492
信任?
Trust?

1145
02:12:44,748 --> 02:12:46,498
我有何资格信任人?
Who am I to trust?

1146
02:12:47,083 --> 02:12:50,252
-我会杀死卡莫德 -对我有什么好处?
-I will kill Commodus. -Why would I want that?

1147
02:12:51,046 --> 02:12:52,755
他令我富有
He makes me rich.

1148
02:12:57,886 --> 02:13:00,721
我知你一诺千金  将军
I know that you are a man of your word, General.

1149
02:13:02,474 --> 02:13:05,059
我知你会为荣誉而死
I know that you would die for honor.

1150
02:13:06,394 --> 02:13:08,354
你会为罗马而死
You would die for Rome.

1151
02:13:09,397 --> 02:13:12,524
你会为纪念组先而死
You would die for the memory of your ancestors.

1152
02:13:12,609 --> 02:13:14,902
但我  相反地...
But I, on the other hand,

1153
02:13:17,614 --> 02:13:19,448
我是个娱乐观众的人
I'm an entertainer.

1154
02:13:22,953 --> 02:13:24,161
守卫!
Guard!

1155
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,585
他杀了还你自由的人
He killed the man who set you free.

1156
02:13:40,762 --> 02:13:42,596
主人  有禁卫军
Praetorians, master.

1157
02:13:48,770 --> 02:13:49,937
停止!
Halt!

1158
02:14:55,086 --> 02:14:56,879
你去了哪里?
Where have you been?

1159
02:14:57,339 --> 02:14:58,922
我派了人召你
I sent for you.

1160
02:15:00,508 --> 02:15:02,176
不要这样  哥哥
Please, brother.

1161
02:15:07,932 --> 02:15:09,808
什么事在困扰你?
What's troubling you?

1162
02:15:12,228 --> 02:15:14,605
格勒斯是否有了新的情人?
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

1163
02:15:16,399 --> 02:15:17,900
我不知道
I don't know.

1164
02:15:19,903 --> 02:15:22,029
我以为你跟他见过面
I thought you'd seen him.

1165
02:15:22,864 --> 02:15:25,366
他像流感般把所有人感染了
He infects everyone like a putrid fever.

1166
02:15:27,202 --> 02:15:30,412
为了罗马帝国的健全 必需令议会流血
For the health of Rome, the Senate must be bled.

1167
02:15:30,830 --> 02:15:32,873
而他亦会流血
And he will bleed, too.

1168
02:15:33,750 --> 02:15:35,125
很快
Very soon.

1169
02:15:36,628 --> 02:15:38,295
但不是今晚
But not tonight.

1170
02:15:53,311 --> 02:15:56,230
你记得父亲有次怎样说吗?
Do you remember what our father said once?

1171
02:15:57,565 --> 02:15:59,233
一个梦...
"It's a dream,

1172
02:16:01,111 --> 02:16:03,028
一个可怕的梦...
"a frightful dream,

1173
02:16:05,573 --> 02:16:06,907
"那是生命"
"life is."

1174
02:16:09,619 --> 02:16:11,703
你觉得那是真的吗?
Do you think that's true?

1175
02:16:12,455 --> 02:16:13,956
我不知道
I don't know.

1176
02:16:17,544 --> 02:16:19,086
我觉得是
I think it is.

1177
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:24,591
而我只得你和我分担
And I have only you to share it with.

1178
02:17:02,172 --> 02:17:03,797
张开口
Open your mouth.

1179
02:17:41,085 --> 02:17:42,878
你知我爱你
You know I love you.

1180
02:17:44,964 --> 02:17:46,548
我也爱你
And I love you.

1181
02:18:23,211 --> 02:18:24,753
去  出去!
Out. Get out!

1182
02:18:25,964 --> 02:18:27,214
动身!
Move!

1183
02:18:31,886 --> 02:18:33,929
恭喜你  将军
Congratulations, General.

1184
02:18:34,013 --> 02:18:36,807
你有些很有说服力的朋友
You've got very persuasive friends.

1185
02:18:42,814 --> 02:18:45,315
我哥哥已拘捕了格勒斯
My brother has had Gracchus arrested.

1186
02:18:45,400 --> 02:18:48,860
我们不能再等  今晚一定要走
We daren't wait any longer. We must leave tonight.

1187
02:18:48,945 --> 02:18:52,573
朴森姆午夜时会来带你出城门
Proximo will come at midnight and take you to the gate.

1188
02:18:53,241 --> 02:18:56,910
你的侍从西塞罗会带着马匹 在那里等你
Your servant, Cicero, will be waiting there with horses.

1189
02:18:58,913 --> 02:19:01,206
-全部是你安排的? -是
-You have done all this? -Yes.

1190
02:19:02,417 --> 02:19:04,126
你冒太大险了
You risk too much.

1191
02:19:05,086 --> 02:19:07,087
我欠了太多
I have much to pay for.

1192
02:19:09,507 --> 02:19:11,717
你没有欠人什么
You have nothing to pay for.

1193
02:19:11,801 --> 02:19:14,886
你爱你儿子  你为他而坚强
You love your son. You're strong for him.

1194
02:19:18,099 --> 02:19:20,434
我厌倦了要坚强
I am tired of being strong.

1195
02:19:22,395 --> 02:19:26,607
我哥哥憎恨全世界 尤其是你
My brother hates all the world, and you most of all.

1196
02:19:27,108 --> 02:19:30,235
-因为你父亲选了我 -不
-Because your father chose me. -No.

1197
02:19:31,529 --> 02:19:33,780
因为我父亲爱你
Because my father loved you.

1198
02:19:37,702 --> 02:19:40,120
因为我爱你
And because I loved you.

1199
02:19:42,707 --> 02:19:44,374
很久以前
A long time ago.

1200
02:19:49,130 --> 02:19:51,256
我那时很不同吗?
Was I very different then?

1201
02:19:57,805 --> 02:19:59,556
你多点笑
You laughed more.

1202
02:20:03,645 --> 02:20:06,063
我一生都觉得孤独...
I have felt alone all my life,

1203
02:20:07,357 --> 02:20:09,024
除了跟你一起时
except with you.

1204
02:20:12,111 --> 02:20:13,487
我要走了
I must go.

1205
02:20:14,155 --> 02:20:15,280
是的
Yes.

1206
02:20:43,768 --> 02:20:44,976
那里
There.

1207
02:20:56,531 --> 02:20:58,031
我打中你
And I got you.

1208
02:21:01,077 --> 02:21:02,994
这个时候扮士兵?
Isn't it late to be playing legionnaire?

1209
02:21:03,079 --> 02:21:05,163
我不是士兵
I'm not a legionnaire.

1210
02:21:05,498 --> 02:21:08,083
-不是士兵? -我是斗士
-Not a legionnaire? -I'm a gladiator.

1211
02:21:09,377 --> 02:21:10,836
斗士?
A gladiator?

1212
02:21:11,546 --> 02:21:14,214
斗士只在竞技场搏斗
Gladiators only fight in the games.

1213
02:21:14,298 --> 02:21:17,718
你不宁愿像凯撒大帝般 做个罗马战士?
Wouldrt you rather be a great Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?

1214
02:21:17,802 --> 02:21:20,387
我是麦克西马  罗马的救世者!
I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!

1215
02:21:23,224 --> 02:21:25,058
罗马的救世者?
The savior of Rome?

1216
02:21:33,067 --> 02:21:34,776
是谁说的?
And who said that?

1217
02:21:43,619 --> 02:21:45,203
路西亚斯在哪里?
Where's Lucius?

1218
02:21:46,414 --> 02:21:48,832
他跟皇上一起  公主
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

1219
02:21:51,753 --> 02:21:53,462
-怎么会 -她的确那样
-She couldn't. -Yes, she did.

1220
02:21:53,546 --> 02:21:55,756
她在篮中拿出来...
She took it from a basket,

1221
02:21:57,175 --> 02:22:00,927
把它压在胸部 就在心口对上
and pressed it to her breast, right here above her heart.

1222
02:22:02,555 --> 02:22:05,766
-它咬了她的胸? -是的
-It bit her in the breast? -Yes.

1223
02:22:06,434 --> 02:22:10,395
你知吗  有时那些贵族女士...
You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies

1224
02:22:10,897 --> 02:22:14,858
为了爱会做些很奇怪的东西
behave very strangely and do very odd things in the name of love.

1225
02:22:14,942 --> 02:22:17,527
-我觉得那样很傻 -我也觉得是
-I think it's silly. -So do I.

1226
02:22:19,614 --> 02:22:20,947
我也觉得是
So do I.

1227
02:22:21,491 --> 02:22:23,575
妹妹  加入我们
Sister, join us.

1228
02:22:24,202 --> 02:22:25,952
我在读书给路西亚斯听
I've been reading to dear Lucius.

1229
02:22:26,037 --> 02:22:28,038
-我也有读 -是的
-I've been reading, too. -Yes.

1230
02:22:28,122 --> 02:22:32,459
他是很聪明的小孩 有天会成为伟大的皇帝
He's a very clever little boy. He'll make a grand emperor one day.

1231
02:22:34,003 --> 02:22:36,421
我们之前在读伟大的马克安东尼
We've been reading about the great Mark Antony,

1232
02:22:36,506 --> 02:22:37,839
和他的埃及历险
and his adventures in Egypt.

1233
02:22:37,924 --> 02:22:40,467
还有那皇后用蛇杀死自己
And the queen killed herself with a snake.

1234
02:22:40,551 --> 02:22:43,887
你还未听我们祖先的故事呢
And just wait until you hear what happened to our ancestors.

1235
02:22:43,971 --> 02:22:45,806
你乖的话
If you're very good,

1236
02:22:45,890 --> 02:22:49,684
明晚我便跟你说 哥狄阿斯皇帝的故事
tomorrow night, I'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius.

1237
02:22:49,769 --> 02:22:51,478
他被最亲近的人...
He was betrayed

1238
02:22:52,688 --> 02:22:54,815
出卖了
by those closest to him.

1239
02:22:56,692 --> 02:22:58,443
他的亲人
By his own blood.

1240
02:22:59,779 --> 02:23:02,239
他们在黑暗角落低声说话...
They whispered in dark corners

1241
02:23:02,323 --> 02:23:04,783
晚上很夜出去...
and went out late at night,

1242
02:23:04,867 --> 02:23:08,203
在计划密谋
and conspired, and conspired.

1243
02:23:10,832 --> 02:23:14,668
但哥狄阿斯皇帝知道他们有阴谋
But the Emperor Claudius knew that they were up to something.

1244
02:23:14,794 --> 02:23:17,337
他知道他们是忙碌的小蜜蜂
He knew they were busy little bees.

1245
02:23:19,298 --> 02:23:22,342
有一晚他召见其中一个
And one night he sat down with one of them,

1246
02:23:23,135 --> 02:23:25,136
他看着她...
and he looked at her,

1247
02:23:25,888 --> 02:23:27,430
然后说...
and he said,

1248
02:23:28,599 --> 02:23:31,184
告诉我你一直在做什么...
"Tell me what you've been doing,

1249
02:23:31,853 --> 02:23:33,562
忙碌的小蜜蜂
"busy little bee.

1250
02:23:35,857 --> 02:23:38,942
不然我会宰掉你最亲的人
"Or I shall strike down those dearest to you.

1251
02:23:40,111 --> 02:23:43,154
"你会看着我用他们的血来沐浴"
"You shall watch as I bathe in their blood."

1252
02:23:46,868 --> 02:23:49,286
那皇帝很伤心
And the Emperor was heartbroken.

1253
02:23:51,372 --> 02:23:56,376
从来没人比那小蜜蜂伤害得他更深
The little bee had wounded him more deeply than anyone else could ever have done.

1254
02:23:58,504 --> 02:24:01,381
路西亚斯  你估接着发生什么事?
What do you think happened then, Lucius?

1255
02:24:02,008 --> 02:24:03,842
我不知道  舅父
I don't know, Uncle.

1256
02:24:10,349 --> 02:24:12,934
那小蜜蜂告诉他所有东西
The little bee told him everything.

1257
02:25:10,826 --> 02:25:13,828
开闸  皇上有令!

1262
02:25:31,639 --> 02:25:33,932
朴森姆  开闸
Open the gates, Proximo.

1263
02:25:34,392 --> 02:25:36,643
你想死吗  老家伙?
Do you want to die, old man?

1264
02:25:37,853 --> 02:25:38,978
拿着

1265
02:25:39,563 --> 02:25:41,731
一切准备好了
Everything is prepared.

1266
02:25:41,816 --> 02:25:44,275
看来你赢得自由了
It seems you have won your freedom.

1267
02:25:44,360 --> 02:25:47,946
朴森姆  你变成好人有危险吗?
Proximo, are you in danger of becoming a good man?

1268
02:25:53,035 --> 02:25:56,871
-祖巴 -与皇帝为敌都要死!
-Juba. -All enemies of the Emperor die!

1269
02:25:57,415 --> 02:25:59,582
开闸!
Open the gates!

1270
02:26:05,089 --> 02:26:07,048
拉!
Pull!

1271
02:26:09,176 --> 02:26:12,053
快!在左边列阵!
Move! Form a column on the left!

1272
02:26:15,850 --> 02:26:19,060
我只需片刻 因此你们要好好保护性命
I only need moments, so do not be careless with your lives.

1273
02:26:19,145 --> 02:26:21,604
如果你不想参与 回自己的牢房去
If you don't want any part of this, go back to your cells.

1274
02:26:21,689 --> 02:26:23,940
我们会在这里等你  麦克西马
We'll wait here for you, Maximus.

1275
02:26:24,024 --> 02:26:25,817
-力量与荣耀 -力量与荣耀
-Strength and honor. -Strength and honor.

1276
02:26:25,901 --> 02:26:26,943
去吧
Go.

1277
02:26:27,820 --> 02:26:29,654
力量与荣耀
Strength and honor.

1278
02:26:32,283 --> 02:26:35,118
瞄准  拉弓!
Aim. Arch your bows!

1279
02:27:26,130 --> 02:27:27,650
奥利里亚斯914-922

1280
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:31,760
朴森姆

1281
02:27:42,228 --> 02:27:43,520
尘与影
Shadows and dust.

1282
02:28:25,437 --> 02:28:26,688
麦克西马!
Maximus!

1283
02:28:32,152 --> 02:28:33,570
对不起
I'm sorry.

1284
02:28:59,972 --> 02:29:01,347
完成了
It's done.

1285
02:29:08,314 --> 02:29:10,189
我应怎处置我的外甥?
And what of my nephew?

1286
02:29:11,275 --> 02:29:13,276
还有他的母亲?
And what of his mother?

1287
02:29:15,362 --> 02:29:17,906
他们是否应跟她爱人同一命运?
Should they share her lover's fate?

1288
02:29:19,617 --> 02:29:21,659
还是我应该慈悲?
Or should I be merciful?

1289
02:29:24,371 --> 02:29:26,289
慈悲的卡莫德
Commodus the Merciful.

1290
02:29:32,713 --> 02:29:35,048
让路西亚斯跟我
Lucius will stay with me now.

1291
02:29:36,216 --> 02:29:38,009
如果他母亲...
And if his mother

1292
02:29:39,386 --> 02:29:41,512
用令我不快的...
so much as looks at me

1293
02:29:42,681 --> 02:29:45,183
眼神看我
in a manner that displeases me,

1294
02:29:47,144 --> 02:29:48,561
他会死
he will die.

1295
02:29:52,066 --> 02:29:55,318
如她决定高贵地...
If she decides to be noble,

1296
02:29:57,071 --> 02:29:59,155
结束自己生命
and takes her own life,

1297
02:30:00,741 --> 02:30:02,200
他会死
he will die.

1298
02:30:05,829 --> 02:30:07,538
至于你...
And as for you,

1299
02:30:10,334 --> 02:30:12,085
你会爱我...
you will love me,

1300
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:14,712
就像我爱你一样
as I have loved you.

1301
02:30:16,298 --> 02:30:19,968
你会替我诞下纯血统的继承人
You will provide me with an heir of pure blood,

1302
02:30:20,928 --> 02:30:22,762
让卡莫德...
so that Commodus

1303
02:30:23,347 --> 02:30:26,307
和他的子孙可统治一千年
and his progeny will rule for 1,000 years.

1304
02:30:30,938 --> 02:30:32,689
我不仁慈吗?
Am I not merciful?

1305
02:30:54,545 --> 02:30:57,171
我不仁慈吗!
Am I not merciful!

1306
02:31:09,393 --> 02:31:13,396
麦克西马!
-Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! -Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1307
02:31:40,841 --> 02:31:43,593
我是军人  我职责是服从
I'm a soldier. I obey.

1308
02:31:46,346 --> 02:31:50,600
没人可以逼你做你不愿意的事
Nothing happens to anyone that he is not fitted by nature to bear.

1309
02:32:23,550 --> 02:32:29,514
麦克西马!
Maximus.

1310
02:32:31,225 --> 02:32:33,059
他们在叫你
They call for you.

1311
02:32:35,020 --> 02:32:38,272
由将军变成奴隶
The general who became a slave.

1312
02:32:39,525 --> 02:32:41,901
由奴隶变成斗士
The slave who became a gladiator.

1313
02:32:43,278 --> 02:32:46,072
公然反抗皇帝的斗士
The gladiator who defied an emperor.

1314
02:32:48,075 --> 02:32:49,742
很引人入胜的故事
A striking story.

1315
02:32:50,911 --> 02:32:54,122
现在他们想知道故事的结局
Now the people want to know how the story ends.

1316
02:32:56,500 --> 02:32:58,751
只有精彩的死亡才配这故事
Only a famous death will do.

1317
02:33:00,671 --> 02:33:03,214
还有什么比...
And what could be more glorious

1318
02:33:03,590 --> 02:33:07,343
在斗兽场挑战皇帝更光荣?
than to challenge the Emperor himself in the great arena?

1319
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:12,723
-你会跟我打? -为什么不?
-You would fight me? -Why not?

1320
02:33:13,809 --> 02:33:15,852
你以为我害怕吗?
Do you think I'm afraid?

1321
02:33:16,770 --> 02:33:19,814
我认为你一生人也在害怕
I think you have been afraid all your life.

1322
02:33:19,898 --> 02:33:23,609
不像无敌的麦克西马  没有恐惧?
Unlike Maximus the Invincible, who knows no fear?

1323
02:33:29,366 --> 02:33:32,743
我认识一个人曾经说: 死亡对着我们微笑
I knew a man who once said, "Death smiles at us all.

1324
02:33:33,620 --> 02:33:36,122
"我们只能也对着它微笑"
"All a man can do is smile back."

1325
02:33:37,916 --> 02:33:39,333
我在想...
I wonder,

1326
02:33:39,960 --> 02:33:42,753
你那朋友有没有对自己的死微笑?
did your friend smile at his own death?

1327
02:33:43,130 --> 02:33:44,630
你要知道
You must know.

1328
02:33:47,551 --> 02:33:49,343
他是你父亲
He was your father.

1329
02:33:53,223 --> 02:33:55,558
你爱我父亲  我知道...
You loved my father, I know,

1330
02:33:57,060 --> 02:33:58,561
但我也是
but so did I.

1331
02:34:00,189 --> 02:34:02,773
我们因此是兄弟  不是吗?
That makes us brothers, doesn't it?

1332
02:34:05,402 --> 02:34:06,986
为我微笑  兄弟
Smile for me now, brother.

1333
02:34:12,993 --> 02:34:15,828
替他着盔甲  遮掩伤口
Strap on his armor. Conceal the wound.

1334
02:35:10,259 --> 02:35:12,218
环形阵!

1335
02:37:03,997 --> 02:37:05,623
昆特斯  剑

1336
02:37:07,125 --> 02:37:08,918
给我你的剑
Give me your sword.

1337
02:37:12,339 --> 02:37:14,340
剑!给我一把剑!
Sword! Give me a sword!

1338
02:37:15,842 --> 02:37:19,345
插剑入鞘
Sheathe your swords. Sheathe your swords!

1339
02:39:34,814 --> 02:39:42,821
麦克西马
Maximus.

1340
02:39:43,406 --> 02:39:44,740
昆特斯
Quintus.

1341
02:39:46,409 --> 02:39:47,868
放了我的人
Free my men.

1342
02:39:49,246 --> 02:39:51,956
让格勒斯议员复职
Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated.

1343
02:39:53,250 --> 02:39:55,334
有一个梦想的罗马
There was a dream that was Rome.

1344
02:39:56,002 --> 02:39:57,878
应该会实现
It shall be realized.

1345
02:39:58,421 --> 02:40:01,006
那就是奥利里亚斯的愿望
These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius.

1346
02:40:02,092 --> 02:40:04,093
放了囚犯  去!
Free the prisoners. Go!

1347
02:40:28,868 --> 02:40:30,202
麦克西马
Maximus.

1348
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:33,664
路西亚斯安全了
Lucius is safe.

1349
02:40:49,973 --> 02:40:51,390
去找他们吧
Go to them.

1350
02:41:41,191 --> 02:41:42,608
你回到家了
You're home.

1351
02:42:09,260 --> 02:42:11,804
罗马值得一个好人牺牲性命吗?
Is Rome won'th one good mars life?

1352
02:42:15,684 --> 02:42:17,476
我们一度相信
We believed it once.

1353
02:42:20,689 --> 02:42:22,815
让我们再次相信
Make us believe it again.

1354
02:42:26,319 --> 02:42:28,404
他是罗马的将士
He was a soldier of Rome.

1355
02:42:32,242 --> 02:42:33,659
让我们给他荣耀
Honor him.

1356
02:42:34,119 --> 02:42:36,286
谁帮我抬他?
Who will help me carry him?

1357
02:43:21,040 --> 02:43:22,708
现在我们自由了
Now we are free.

1358
02:43:29,090 --> 02:43:30,966
我会再见到你
