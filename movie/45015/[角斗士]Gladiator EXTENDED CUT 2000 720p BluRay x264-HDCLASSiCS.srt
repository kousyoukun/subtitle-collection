1
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,448
Sir.

2
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,782
General.

3
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,794
Sir.

4
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,478
Lean and hungry.

5
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,359
- Still nothing? - Not a sign.

6
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,320
- How long has he been gone? - Nearly two hours.

7
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,075
Will they fight, sir?

8
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,660
We shall know soon enough.

9
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,287
Soldier, I ordered you to move those catapults forward.

10
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,665
- They're out of range. - Range is good.

11
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,795
- The danger to the cavalry... - Is acceptable. Agreed?

12
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,555
They say no.

13
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,042
People should know when they're conquered.

14
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,305
Would you, Quintus?

15
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,515
Would I?

16
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,951
- Strength and honor. - Strength and honor.

17
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,752
At my signal, unleash hell.

18
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,984
Load the catapults.

19
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,820
Infantry form up for advance.

20
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,699
- Archers ready. - Archers!

21
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,284
- Nock! - Nock!

22
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,434
Fratres!

23
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,353
- Maximus! - Maximus!

24
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,900
Three weeks from now, I will be harvesting my crops.

25
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:46,446
Imagine where you will be, and it will be so.

26
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:50,492
Hold the line! Stay with me!

27
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,245
If you find yourself alone,

28
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,331
riding in green fields with the sun on your face,

29
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,709
do not be troubled.

30
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:04,172
For you are in Elysium, and you're already dead!

31
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,009
Brothers,

32
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,221
what we do in life

33
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,932
echoes in eternity.

34
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,733
Pull!

35
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,376
Cohorts ready, sir!

36
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,389
Archers, ignite!

37
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,267
- Ignite! - Ignite!

38
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,817
Archers, draw!

39
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,655
Loose!

40
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,770
All right, men, ready!

41
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,569
Hold the line!

42
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,955
Loose!

43
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,498
Reload!

44
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,547
Hold the line!

45
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,966
- Draw! - Loose!

46
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:22,894
Stay with me!

47
00:09:50,840 --> 00:12:28,705
Roma victor!

48
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,041
Do you think he's really dying?

49
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,461
He's been dying for 10 years.

50
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,965
If he werert really dying, he wouldn't have sent for us.

51
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,842
Maybe he just misses us.

52
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,512
And the senators? He wouldn't have summoned them if...

53
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,888
Peace, Commodus.

54
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,264
After two weeks on the road,

55
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,017
your incessant scheming is hurting my head.

56
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,861
He's made his decision. He's going to announce it.

57
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,408
He will name me.

58
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,915
The first thing I shall do when...

59
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,004
Is honor him with games won'thy of His Majesty.

60
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,926
For now, the first thing I shall do is have a hot bath.

61
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,429
Your Highness?

62
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,227
We seem to be almost there, sir.

63
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,610
- Sire. - Where's the Emperor?

64
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,364
He's at the front, sire. They've been gone for 19 days.

65
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,658
The wounded are still coming in.

66
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,368
My horse.

67
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,120
My lord.

68
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,749
Kiss?

69
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:16,205
You have proved your valor yet again, Maximus.

70
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,085
Let us hope, for the last time.

71
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,755
There's no one left to fight, sire.

72
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,507
There is always someone left to fight.

73
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,510
How can I reward Rome's greatest general?

74
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,517
Let me go home.

75
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,313
Home.

76
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,667
They honor you, Caesar.

77
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,544
It's for you, Maximus. They honor you.

78
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,237
Have I missed it? Have I missed the battle?

79
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,699
You have missed the war.

80
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,992
Father, congratulations.

81
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,870
I shall sacrifice 100 bulls to honor your triumph.

82
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,622
Save the bulls.

83
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,166
Honor Maximus. He won the battle.

84
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,919
- General. - Highness.

85
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,507
Rome salutes you, and I embrace you as a brother.

86
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,384
It has been too long, my old friend.

87
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,927
Highness.

88
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:55,596
Here, Father. Take my arm.

89
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,393
I think it is time for me to leave.

90
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,870
So much for the glory of Rome.

91
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,710
Magnificent battle.

92
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,361
General. Still alive?

93
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,737
Still alive.

94
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,447
The gods must have a sense of humor.

95
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,200
- The gods must love you. - Valerius.

96
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,161
Back to barracks, General? Or to Rome?

97
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,331
Home. My wife, my son, the harvest.

98
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,294
Maximus the farmer. I still have difficulty imagining that.

99
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:35,006
You know, dirt cleans off a lot easier than blood, Quintus.

100
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,174
- Here he is. - Highness.

101
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,427
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

102
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,388
Beware of Gaius. He'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear,

103
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:46,058
and you'll wake up one day and all you'll say is, "Republic, republic, republic."

104
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,811
Well, why not? Rome was founded as a republic.

105
00:19:48,895 --> 00:19:51,772
Yes, and in a republic the senate has the power.

106
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,066
But Senator Gaius isn't influenced by that, of course.

107
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,153
Where do you stand, General? Emperor or Senate?

108
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,487
A soldier has the advantage

109
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,991
of being able to look his enemy in the eye, Senator.

110
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:06,078
Well, with an army behind you, you could be extremely political.

111
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,290
I warned you. Now I shall save you. Senators.

112
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,551
Maximus.

113
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,138
I'm going to need good men like you.

114
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,809
How may I be of service, Highness?

115
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,937
You're a man who knows what it is to command.

116
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,358
You give your orders, the orders are obeyed, and the battle is won.

117
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:40,237
But these senators scheme, squabble and flatter and deceive.

118
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,783
Maximus, we must save Rome from the politicians, my friend.

119
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,994
Can I count on you when the time comes?

120
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:55,753
Highness, when your father releases me, I intend to return home.

121
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:59,006
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.

122
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,345
Don't get too comfortable. I may call on you before long.

123
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,016
Lucilla's here. Did you know?

124
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,435
She's not forgotten you.

125
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,064
And now, you're the great man.

126
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,870
If only you had been born a man,

127
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,207
what a Caesar you would have made.

128
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,335
Father.

129
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,343
You would have been strong.

130
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,680
I wonder, would you have been just?

131
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,100
I would have been what you taught me to be.

132
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,645
How was yourjourney?

133
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,482
Long. Uncomfortable. Why have I come?

134
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,652
I need your help. With your brother.

135
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,779
Of course.

136
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,990
He loves you. He always has.

137
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,242
And

138
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,289
he will need you now, more than ever.

139
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,254
Enough of politics.

140
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,466
Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter,

141
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,427
and I am a good father.

142
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,727
This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?

143
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,200
Good morning to you.

144
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,882
I need three more horses.

145
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,936
One! Two! Three!

146
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,938
Four!

147
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,273
One! Two!

148
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,416
You sent for me, Caesar?

149
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,049
- Caesar? - Tell me again, Maximus.

150
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:49,844
Why are we here?

151
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,681
For the glory of the empire, sire.

152
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,182
Yes.

153
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,186
Yes, I remember.

154
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,525
Do you see that map, Maximus?

155
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,862
That is the world which I created.

156
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,364
For 25 years,

157
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,785
I have conquered, spilt blood, expanded the empire.

158
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,957
Since I became Caesar, I've known four years without war.

159
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,543
Four years of peace in 20.

160
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,336
And for what?

161
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,556
I brought the sword. Nothing more.

162
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,142
Caesar, your life...

163
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,811
Please. Please don't call me that.

164
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,355
Come. Please.

165
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,524
Come sit.

166
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,069
Let us talk together now,

167
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,072
very simply, as men.

168
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,575
Well, Maximus,

169
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,120
talk.

170
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:04,084
Five thousand of my men are out there in the freezing mud.

171
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,961
Three thousand of them are bloodied and cleaved.

172
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,504
Two thousand will never leave this place.

173
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,799
I will not believe that they fought and died for nothing.

174
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,509
And what would you believe?

175
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:16,430
They fought for you and for Rome.

176
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,307
And what is Rome, Maximus?

177
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,895
I've seen much of the rest of the world.

178
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:26,982
It is brutal and cruel and dark. Rome is the light.

179
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,984
Yet you have never been there.

180
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,528
You have not seen what it has become.

181
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,657
I am dying, Maximus.

182
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,575
When a man sees his end,

183
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,703
he wants to know there was some purpose to his life.

184
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,999
How will the world speak my name in years to come?

185
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,377
Will I be known as the philosopher?

186
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,962
The warrior?

187
00:25:48,254 --> 00:25:49,672
The tyrant?

188
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:55,803
Or will I be the Emperor who gave Rome back her true self?

189
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,223
There was once a dream that was Rome.

190
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,059
You could only whisper it.

191
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:05,229
Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish,

192
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,147
it was so fragile.

193
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,151
And I fear that it will not survive the winter.

194
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,154
Maximus,

195
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,992
let us whisper now,

196
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,952
together, you and I.

197
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,162
You have a son.

198
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,541
Tell me about your home.

199
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,675
My house is in the hills above Trujillo.

200
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,803
A very simple place.

201
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:41,140
Pink stones that warm in the sun.

202
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,727
A kitchen garden that smells of herbs in the day,

203
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,396
jasmine in the evening.

204
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,650
Through the gate is a giant poplar.

205
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,778
Figs, apples, pears.

206
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,699
The soil, Marcus, black. Black like my wife's hair.

207
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,910
Grapes on the south slopes, olives on the north.

208
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,246
Wild ponies play near my house. They tease my son.

209
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,956
He wants to be one of them.

210
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,833
When was the last time you were home?

211
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:11,045
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

212
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:15,966
I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home.

213
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,386
Worth fighting for.

214
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,349
There is one more duty

215
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,644
that I ask of you before you go home.

216
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,690
What would you have me do, Caesar?

217
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:35,402
I want you to become the protector of Rome after I die.

218
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:39,573
I will empower you to one end alone,

219
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:43,577
to give power back to the people of Rome,

220
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,997
and end the corruption that has crippled it.

221
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:56,924
Will you accept this great honor that I have offered you?

222
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,219
With all my heart, no.

223
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,515
Maximus,

224
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,018
that is why it must be you.

225
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,187
But surely a prefect, a senator,

226
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,981
somebody who knows the city, who understands her politics.

227
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,026
But you have not been corrupted by her politics.

228
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,660
- And Commodus? - Commodus is not a moral man.

229
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,247
You have known that since you were young.

230
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,290
Commodus cannot rule.

231
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,751
He must not rule.

232
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:37,089
You are the son that I should have had.

233
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,636
Commodus will accept my decision.

234
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:49,685
He knows that you command the loyalty of the army.

235
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,150
I need some time, sire.

236
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,693
Yes.

237
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:01,321
By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.

238
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,575
Now embrace me as my son.

239
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,706
And bring an old man another blanket.

240
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,433
- My father favors you now. - My lady.

241
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,020
- It was not always so. - Many things change.

242
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,523
Many things. Not everything.

243
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,069
Maximus, stop.

244
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,533
Let me see your face.

245
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,788
- You seem upset. - I lost many men.

246
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:55,042
What did my father want with you?

247
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:59,087
To wish me well before I leave for home.

248
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,215
You're lying.

249
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:04,885
I could always tell when you were lying, because you were never any good at it.

250
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,470
I never acquired your comfort with it.

251
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,596
True.

252
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,765
But then you never had to.

253
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,976
Life is more simple for a soldier.

254
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,980
Or do you think me heartless?

255
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,734
I think you have a talent for survival.

256
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,283
Maximus, stop.

257
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,372
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?

258
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,958
No. I'm tired from battle.

259
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,378
It hurts you to see my father so fragile.

260
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:46,927
Commodus expects that my father will announce his succession within days.

261
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,473
Will you serve my brother as you served his father?

262
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,811
I will always serve Rome.

263
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,523
Do you know,

264
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:02,109
I still remember you in my prayers.

265
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:06,071
Oh, yes. I pray.

266
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,954
I was sad to hear of your husband's death. I mourned him.

267
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,667
- Thank you. - And I hear you have a son.

268
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,754
Yes. Lucius.

269
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,341
He'll be nearly eight years old.

270
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,677
My son is also nearly eight.

271
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,640
I thank you for your prayers.

272
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,942
Ancestors, I ask for your guidance.

273
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,822
Blessed Mother, come to me with the gods' desire for my future.

274
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,244
Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son with a ready sword.

275
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:58,332
Whisper to them, I live only to hold them again.

276
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,668
Ancestors, I honor you,

277
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:06,131
and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me.

278
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,238
Cicero.

279
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:35,952
Sir.

280
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,959
Do you ever find it hard to do your duty?

281
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,256
Sometimes I do what I want to do.

282
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,551
The rest of the time, I do what I have to.

283
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:57,432
We may not be able to go home, after all.

284
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,361
Are you ready to do your duty for Rome?

285
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,949
Yes, Father.

286
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:59,119
You will not be emperor.

287
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,791
Which wiser, older man is to take my place?

288
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,419
My powers will pass to Maximus,

289
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,380
to hold in trust,

290
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:14,176
until the Senate is ready to rule once more.

291
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:19,181
Rome is to be a republic again.

292
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,727
- Maximus. - Yes.

293
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,068
My decision disappoints you?

294
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,657
You wrote to me once,

295
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,953
listing the four chief virtues.

296
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,081
Wisdom,

297
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,625
justice,

298
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,168
fortitude,

299
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,378
and temperance.

300
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,675
As I read the list, I knew I had none of them.

301
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,095
But I have other virtues, Father.

302
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,640
Ambition.

303
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,852
That can be a virtue when it drives us to excel.

304
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:10,273
Resourcefulness, courage.

305
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,654
Perhaps not on the battlefield, but there are many forms of courage.

306
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:20,534
Devotion to my family,

307
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,036
to you.

308
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,332
But none of my virtues were on your list.

309
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:32,921
Even then it was as if you didn't want me for your son.

310
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,381
Commodus,

311
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,925
you go too far.

312
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,720
I searched the faces of the gods

313
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:45,850
for ways to please you, to make you proud.

314
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,728
One kind word,

315
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:51,064
one full hug,

316
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,901
where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight,

317
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,573
would have been like the sun on my heart for 1,000 years.

318
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,828
What is it in me you hate so much?

319
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,121
Commodus.

320
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,291
All I've ever wanted

321
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:13,837
was to live up to you, Caesar.

322
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,757
- Father. - Commodus,

323
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:24,264
your faults as a son

324
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,602
is my failure as a father.

325
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,780
Come.

326
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,785
Father.

327
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,428
I would butcher the whole world,

328
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,806
if you would only have loved me!

329
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,555
Maximus, the Emperor needs you. It's urgent.

330
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,854
Lament with me, brother.

331
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,899
Our great father is dead.

332
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,219
How did he die?

333
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,181
The surgeons say there was no pain.

334
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,392
His breath gave out as he slept.

335
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,403
Father.

336
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,742
Your emperor asks for your loyalty, Maximus.

337
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,703
Take my hand.

338
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,249
I only offer it once.

339
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,765
Quintus.

340
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,483
Hail, Caesar.

341
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:07,070
I must talk to the senators. I need their counsel.

342
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,739
- Wake Gaius and Falco. - Gaius and Falco.

343
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,033
- Sword. - Sword.

344
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,455
Maximus, please be careful. That was not prudent.

345
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,333
Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.

346
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,294
The emperor died of natural causes.

347
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,298
- Why are you armed, Quintus? - Guards!

348
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,679
Please don't fight, Maximus.

349
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:36,724
I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.

350
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,977
Ride until dawn,

351
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,771
and then execute him.

352
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,274
Quintus, look at me. Look at me!

353
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,443
Promise me that you will look after my family.

354
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,197
Your family will meet you in the afterlife.

355
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,307
Kneel.

356
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,229
Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son.

357
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:26,399
Whisper to them that I live only to hold them again.

358
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,404
At least give me a clean death.

359
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,908
A soldier's death.

360
00:41:56,221 --> 00:41:59,390
The frost, sometimes it makes the blade stick.

361
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,454
Praetorian!

362
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,119
When was the last time you were home?

363
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:46,205
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

364
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,625
Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son with a ready sword.

365
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,086
I will try to live with the dignity you have taught me.

366
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,630
Whisper to them, I live only to hold them again.

367
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,133
...with a ready sword, for all else is dust and air.

368
00:43:57,217 --> 00:44:00,386
Whisper to them, I live only to hold them again.

369
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,764
For all else is dust and air.

370
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,034
Papa!

371
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,616
Don't die.

372
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,582
You'll meet them again.

373
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:01,919
Not yet.

374
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:14,223
No. They will clean it. Wait and see.

375
00:48:48,633 --> 00:48:50,009
Don't die.

376
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,220
They'll feed you to the lions.

377
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,598
They are won'th more than we are.

378
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,068
Better now?

379
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,071
Clean. You see?

380
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,646
Proximo! My old friend.

381
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:48,109
Every day is a great day when you are here,

382
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:52,738
but today is your most fortunate day.

383
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:59,078
Those giraffes you sold me, they won't mate.

384
00:49:59,704 --> 00:50:03,624
Theyjust walk around eating and not mating.

385
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,837
You sold me queer giraffes.

386
00:50:08,713 --> 00:50:11,424
- I want my money back. - Not a chance.

387
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,847
- I do special price for you. - On what?

388
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:22,852
Have you seen my new stock? Come and see them.

389
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:39,577
Do any of them fight? I've got a match coming up.

390
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:42,455
Some are good for fighting, others for dying.

391
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,874
You need both, I think.

392
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,167
Get up.

393
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,801
What's your trade?

394
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,761
I was a hunter.

395
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:01,557
No, I bought him from a salt mine in Can'thage.

396
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,726
Sit down.

397
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:08,939
Mark of the legion.

398
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,860
- Deserter. - Maybe so, but who cares?

399
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,445
He's a Spaniard.

400
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,489
I'll take six. For 1,000.

401
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:20,075
1,000? The Numidian alone is won'th 2,000.

402
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,244
These slaves are rotten.

403
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:25,498
It all adds to the flavor. No, no, no, wait! Wait!

404
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,708
I can negotiate.

405
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:33,005
I'll give you 2,000, and 4,000 for the beasts.

406
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:35,216
That's 5,000 for an old friend.

407
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:56,278
Come on! How long does it take to get into my own house?

408
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,280
I am Proximo.

409
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,534
I shall be closer to you for the next few days,

410
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,827
which will be the last of your miserable lives,

411
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:08,249
than that bitch of a mother that brought you screaming into this world.

412
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,877
I did not pay good money for you for your company.

413
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:16,298
I paid it so that I could profit from your death.

414
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:20,803
And as your mother was there at your beginning,

415
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,390
so I shall be there at your end.

416
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:28,936
And when you die, and die you shall,

417
00:52:29,854 --> 00:52:32,773
your transition shall be to the sound of...

418
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,946
Gladiators,

419
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,615
I salute you.

420
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,413
Red.

421
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:54,837
Yellow.

422
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,682
Good.

423
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,851
- Red. - Red.

424
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,065
Spaniard.

425
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,768
That's enough for the moment!

426
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,728
His time will come.

427
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:56,815
Next.

428
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,497
Spaniard,

429
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,792
why don't you fight?

430
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:16,627
We all have to fight.

431
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,420
Well, I don't fight.

432
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:22,299
I shouldn't be here, I'm a scribe, I write down words,

433
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,259
and speak seven languages.

434
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,386
Good.

435
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:29,348
Tomorrow, you can scream in seven languages.

436
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:40,984
Perhaps the scribe will be the one who wins his freedom.

437
00:54:41,986 --> 00:54:43,278
Freedom?

438
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,198
What do I have to do?

439
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,909
You go in the arena and you kill me.

440
00:54:48,993 --> 00:54:50,369
And him,

441
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,080
and the Numidian,

442
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,748
and the deserter.

443
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,793
And 100 more.

444
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:00,713
And when there's no more to fight, you're free.

445
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,132
I can't do that.

446
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,384
No?

447
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,058
But I can.

448
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,784
Is that the sign of your gods?

449
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,083
Will that not anger them?

450
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:01,064
The gods favor you.

451
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,609
Red is the gods' color.

452
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:07,154
You will need their help today.

453
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,153
Proximo!

454
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,661
Still leading with the German?

455
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,829
The crowd love a barbarian.

456
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,207
Besides that, he's making me rich.

457
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,918
Has that Numidian fought before?

458
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,337
No, first time.

459
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:08,382
And that one, laborer, soldier?

460
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,050
He's a Spaniard.

461
00:57:10,134 --> 00:57:13,220
He might as well be a eunuch for what he brings to the ring.

462
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:18,392
500 sestertii, the Numidian and Spaniard team makes it through.

463
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:22,187
And 1,000, that the Numidian makes it through alone.

464
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,817
Are you asking me to bet against my own man?

465
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,153
It's unethical.

466
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,114
What if I make it 2,000?

467
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:49,464
Some of you are thinking you won't fight,

468
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,050
some that you can't fight.

469
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:56,888
They all say that until they're out there.

470
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:00,851
Listen.

471
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:03,854
- Kill! Kill! Kill! - Kill! Kill! Kill!

472
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,697
Thrust this into another mars flesh,

473
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,783
and they will applaud and love you for that.

474
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,285
And you,

475
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,205
you may begin to love them

476
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,458
for that.

477
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:32,049
Ultimately, we're all dead men.

478
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,887
Sadly, we cannot choose how,

479
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:40,932
but we can decide how we meet that end,

480
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,353
in order that we are remembered

481
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,522
as men.

482
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:48,649
Come on!

483
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,904
On the left, draw your shields!

484
00:58:54,947 --> 00:58:57,324
On the right, draw your swords!

485
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,160
- Kill! Kill! Kill! - Kill! Kill! Kill!

486
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,705
Pair them up, red with yellow.

487
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:09,961
Next!

488
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:16,927
Move!

489
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,333
Usurper!

490
01:02:57,982 --> 01:03:00,692
- Go away! - You'll never rule us, Commodus!

491
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:35,810
He enters Rome like a conquering hero. But what has he conquered?

492
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:38,521
Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.

493
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:40,899
I think he could do very well.

494
01:03:41,233 --> 01:03:43,193
For Rome, or for you?

495
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,577
Go to your mother, Lucius. It's what she'd like.

496
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:01,086
- Lucius! - Mother!

497
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:04,923
Hail, Caesar.

498
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,508
Senators.

499
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:13,056
Rome greets her new emperor.

500
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:16,685
Your loyal subjects bid you welcome, Highness.

501
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,603
Thank you, Falco.

502
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:22,774
And for the loyal subjects, I trust they werert too expensive.

503
01:04:22,858 --> 01:04:24,859
- Caesar. - Gracchus.

504
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,445
All Rome rejoices in your return, Caesar.

505
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:31,032
But there are many matters that require your attention.

506
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:36,371
To order, please. To order.

507
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,623
For your guidance, Caesar,

508
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,501
the Senate has prepared a series of protocols

509
01:04:41,585 --> 01:04:44,671
to begin addressing the many problems in the city,

510
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:48,842
beginning with basic sanitation for the Greek Quarter,

511
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:52,971
to combat the plague which is already springing up there.

512
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,848
So, if Caesar...

513
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,893
Don't you see, Gracchus?

514
01:05:00,312 --> 01:05:02,605
That's the very problem, isn't it?

515
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:05,692
My father spent all his time at study,

516
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:10,822
at books of learning and philosophy.

517
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:15,326
He spent his twilight hours reading scrolls from the Senate.

518
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:19,497
And all the while, the people were forgotten.

519
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:22,292
But the senate is the people, sire,

520
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:25,920
chosen from among the people to speak for the people.

521
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:30,216
I doubt many of the people eat so well as you do, Gracchus.

522
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:33,428
Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.

523
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:35,597
I think I understand my own people.

524
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:39,184
Then perhaps Caesar will be so good as to teach us,

525
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,228
out of his own extensive experience.

526
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:47,650
I call it love.

527
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:51,362
I am their father. The people are my children.

528
01:05:51,655 --> 01:05:54,157
And I shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly.

529
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:57,702
Have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire?

530
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:06,628
No, but if you interrupt me again,

531
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,464
I assure you that you shall.

532
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:11,883
Senator, my brother is very tired.

533
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:17,055
Leave your list with me. Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.

534
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:22,560
My lady, as always, your lightest touch commands obedience.

535
01:06:29,693 --> 01:06:31,945
Who are they to lecture me?

536
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,781
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

537
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:37,742
What uses? All they do is talk.

538
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:43,498
It should be just you and me and Rome.

539
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:46,918
Don't even think it. There's always been a Senate.

540
01:06:47,419 --> 01:06:49,087
Rome has changed.

541
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:52,215
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.

542
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,592
Of course, but leave the people their...

543
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,052
Illusions?

544
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,097
Traditions.

545
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:02,767
My father's war against the barbarians.

546
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:07,021
He said it himself, it achieved nothing. But the people loved him.

547
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,982
The people always love victories.

548
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:12,735
Why? They didn't see the battles.

549
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:16,030
What do they care about Germania?

550
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,449
They care about the greatness of Rome.

551
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,451
"The greatness of Rome."

552
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:24,205
Well, what is that?

553
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:30,128
It's an idea. Greatness.

554
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:37,302
- Greatness is a vision. - Exactly. A vision.

555
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:41,347
Do you not see, Lucilla?

556
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:46,686
I will give the people a vision of Rome, and they'll love me for it.

557
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:51,733
And they'll soon forget the tedious sermonizing of a few dry old men.

558
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:06,456
I will give the people the greatest vision of their lives.

559
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:00,593
White and red wine for your drinking pleasure!

560
01:09:08,894 --> 01:09:10,061
Games.

561
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:15,400
One hundred and fifty days of games.

562
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:17,443
He's cleverer than I thought.

563
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:21,072
Clever. The whole of Rome would be laughing at him,

564
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:24,158
if they werert so afraid of his Praetorians.

565
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:27,036
Fear and wonder. A powerful combination.

566
01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:31,582
You really think the people are going to be seduced by that?

567
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:34,752
I think he knows what Rome is. Rome is the mob.

568
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:38,589
Conjure magic for them, and they'll be distracted.

569
01:09:39,174 --> 01:09:42,427
Take away their freedom, and still they'll roar.

570
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:47,348
The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate.

571
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,434
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

572
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:53,479
He'll bring them death,

573
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:57,608
and they will love him for it.

574
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:22,383
All you do is kill, kill, kill.

575
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,886
The crowd don't want a butcher, they want a hero.

576
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:27,013
We want them to keep coming back.

577
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:31,267
So don'tjust hack them to pieces, remember you are an entertainer.

578
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:35,229
Spaniard.

579
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,572
So entertain!

580
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:53,808
Are you not entertained? Are you not entertained?

581
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:58,354
Is this not why you're here?

582
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,987
Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

583
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:10,449
- Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard! - Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

584
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:25,006
What do you want?

585
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:28,718
Girl?

586
01:12:29,761 --> 01:12:30,928
Boy?

587
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:34,098
- You sent for me. - Yes, I did.

588
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,269
You're good, Spaniard, but you're not that good.

589
01:12:38,353 --> 01:12:39,520
You could be magnificent.

590
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:43,107
I'm required to kill, so I kill. That is enough.

591
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:47,028
That's enough for the provinces, but not for Rome.

592
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:54,327
The young emperor has arranged a series of spectacles

593
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:58,581
to commemorate his father, Marcus Aurelius.

594
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:01,083
I find that amusing,

595
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:04,503
since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise,

596
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:08,049
the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius, that closed us down.

597
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:15,181
So finally, after five years of scratching a living

598
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:17,475
in flea-infested villages,

599
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:20,603
we're finally going back to where we belong.

600
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:22,897
The Colosseum.

601
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:27,944
You should see the Colosseum, Spaniard.

602
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:31,322
Fifty thousand Romans,

603
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:36,118
watching every movement of your sword,

604
01:13:37,537 --> 01:13:40,039
willing you to make that killer blow.

605
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:44,835
The silence before you strike and the noise afterwards.

606
01:13:45,837 --> 01:13:49,465
It rises. It rises up,

607
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:52,301
like a storm.

608
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:55,763
As if you were the thunder god himself.

609
01:13:55,847 --> 01:13:58,808
- You were a gladiator? - Yes, I was.

610
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:07,441
You won your freedom?

611
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:09,860
A long time ago, the Emperor

612
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,614
presented me with a rudius.

613
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:16,409
It's just a wooden sword.

614
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,371
The symbol of your freedom.

615
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,543
He touched me on the shoulder, and I was free.

616
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,338
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

617
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:33,676
I did not say I knew him. I said he touched me on the shoulder once.

618
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,387
You asked me what I want.

619
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,683
I, too, want to stand in front of the Emperor,

620
01:14:41,935 --> 01:14:43,352
as you did.

621
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:46,856
Then listen to me. Learn from me.

622
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:50,776
I wasrt the best because I killed quickly.

623
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:54,655
I was the best because the crowd loved me.

624
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:59,076
Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom.

625
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,416
I will win the crowd.

626
01:15:07,627 --> 01:15:11,088
I will give them something they've never seen before.

627
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:15,092
So, Spaniard, we shall go to Rome together

628
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:17,595
and have bloody adventures.

629
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,472
And the great whore will suckle us

630
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:22,141
until we are fat and happy and can suckle no more.

631
01:15:22,225 --> 01:15:23,684
And then,

632
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,937
when enough men have died,

633
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:31,567
perhaps you will have your freedom.

634
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:38,324
Here. Use this.

635
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:05,226
It's somewhere out there, my country.

636
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:07,645
My home.

637
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,981
My wife is preparing food.

638
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:14,652
My daughters carry water from the river.

639
01:16:15,987 --> 01:16:18,030
Will I ever see them again?

640
01:16:19,324 --> 01:16:20,825
I think, no.

641
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:23,577
Do you believe you'll see them again when you die?

642
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,037
I think so.

643
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:28,749
But then, I will die soon.

644
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:32,837
They will not die for many years.

645
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:35,297
I'll have to wait.

646
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:37,550
But you would? Wait?

647
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:39,552
Of course.

648
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:42,847
You see,

649
01:16:44,015 --> 01:16:47,560
my wife and my son

650
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,439
are already waiting for me.

651
01:16:51,523 --> 01:16:55,192
You'll meet them again. But not yet.

652
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:00,614
Not yet.

653
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,909
- Unless... - Not yet.

654
01:17:07,914 --> 01:17:09,206
Not yet.

655
01:17:22,095 --> 01:17:23,637
There he is.

656
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:13,896
Out.

657
01:18:15,106 --> 01:18:17,024
Move, go, out!

658
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:32,248
Good to see you again, old friend.

659
01:18:37,587 --> 01:18:39,296
Bring me fortune.

660
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:46,762
Have you ever seen anything like that before?

661
01:18:47,847 --> 01:18:50,432
I didn't know men could build such things.

662
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:01,986
Win the crowd.

663
01:19:02,195 --> 01:19:04,530
Get inside. Move.

664
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:05,906
Inside.

665
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:57,875
He sleeps so well because he's loved.

666
01:20:00,795 --> 01:20:02,880
Come, brother. It's late.

667
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:09,303
I will make Rome the wonder of the ages.

668
01:20:12,098 --> 01:20:15,434
That is what Gracchus and his friends don't understand.

669
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:19,063
All my desires are splitting my head to pieces.

670
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:28,864
Commodus, drink this tonic.

671
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:40,876
I think the time is almost right.

672
01:20:41,252 --> 01:20:44,171
I could announce the dissolution of the Senate

673
01:20:44,255 --> 01:20:46,340
at the celebration to honor our father.

674
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:48,384
Do you think I should?

675
01:20:49,135 --> 01:20:51,053
Are the people ready?

676
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:55,557
I think you need your rest now.

677
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:03,315
Will you stay with me?

678
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,818
Still afraid of the dark, brother?

679
01:21:12,575 --> 01:21:13,784
Still.

680
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:16,912
Always.

681
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:21,500
- Stay with me tonight. - You know I won't.

682
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:27,506
Then kiss me.

683
01:21:36,307 --> 01:21:37,850
Sleep, brother.

684
01:22:30,653 --> 01:22:32,780
Having servants who are deaf and mute

685
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:35,616
at least ensures I live a little longer.

686
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:39,745
They're arresting scholars now.

687
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:43,665
Anyone who dare speak out. Even satirists and chroniclers.

688
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,210
And mathematicians.

689
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:49,546
And all to feed the arena.

690
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:53,634
The Senate did not approve martial law.

691
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:56,553
This reign of terror is entirely the Praetorians.

692
01:22:57,722 --> 01:22:59,848
I'm afraid to go out after dark.

693
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:03,477
You should be more afraid of your activities during the day.

694
01:23:03,561 --> 01:23:08,273
The Senate is full of his spies, led by that whore master, Falco.

695
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:14,029
But what is in his mind? That's what I trouble myselfwith.

696
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,741
He spends all his days singularly obsessed,

697
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,661
planning the festival to honor your father.

698
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:24,331
He neglects even the most fundamental task of government.

699
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:27,292
So just what is he planning?

700
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:29,294
And what pays for it?

701
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:33,590
These daily games are costing a fortune, yet we have no new taxes.

702
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:35,759
The future.

703
01:23:37,136 --> 01:23:39,179
The future pays for it.

704
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,517
He's started selling the grain reserves.

705
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:45,435
This can't be true.

706
01:23:46,062 --> 01:23:48,564
He's selling Rome's reserves of grain.

707
01:23:49,148 --> 01:23:52,067
The people will be starving in two years.

708
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:54,111
I hope they're enjoying the games,

709
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:57,573
because soon enough they'll be dead because of them.

710
01:23:57,907 --> 01:24:00,242
- Rome must know this. - And how?

711
01:24:00,743 --> 01:24:03,120
He's going to dissolve the Senate.

712
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:07,291
And who will tell them before it's too late? You, Gracchus?

713
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:10,127
You, Gaius.

714
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:11,920
Will you make a speech on the floor of the Senate,

715
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:13,755
denouncing my brother?

716
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:16,842
And then see your family in the Colosseum?

717
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:19,177
Who'd dare?

718
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:31,398
I have been living in a prison of fear every day,

719
01:24:31,482 --> 01:24:34,067
because my son is heir to the throne.

720
01:24:39,657 --> 01:24:41,158
He must die.

721
01:24:45,496 --> 01:24:49,291
Quintus and the Praetorians would simply seize control for themselves.

722
01:24:49,375 --> 01:24:53,253
No. Cut off the head and the snake cannot strike.

723
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:55,380
Lucilla, Gaius is right.

724
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:59,593
Until we can neutralize the Praetorians, we can achieve nothing.

725
01:25:01,137 --> 01:25:02,638
So we do nothing?

726
01:25:02,722 --> 01:25:05,515
No, child. We keep our counsel.

727
01:25:06,517 --> 01:25:07,851
We prepare.

728
01:25:08,686 --> 01:25:13,482
As long as the people support him, we are voices without steel.

729
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:15,692
We are air.

730
01:25:18,696 --> 01:25:21,490
But with every day that passes, he makes enemies.

731
01:25:21,574 --> 01:25:24,451
One day, he'll have more enemies than friends.

732
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:27,829
And on that day, we will act.

733
01:25:28,414 --> 01:25:30,290
Then we will strike.

734
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:32,960
But until then,

735
01:25:34,128 --> 01:25:35,712
we are docile.

736
01:25:36,172 --> 01:25:38,340
We are obedient.

737
01:25:39,926 --> 01:25:41,927
And we are treacherous.

738
01:25:50,561 --> 01:25:51,728
Come on!

739
01:26:00,571 --> 01:26:02,614
All right, that's enough.

740
01:26:25,179 --> 01:26:26,513
The Emperor wants battles,

741
01:26:26,597 --> 01:26:28,765
and I don't want to sacrifice my best fighters.

742
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:32,185
The crowd wants battles, so the Emperor gives them battles.

743
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:35,856
- You get the battle of Can'thage. - Massacre of Can'thage.

744
01:26:37,817 --> 01:26:39,234
Well, why don't you go down to the prison,

745
01:26:39,318 --> 01:26:41,319
round up all the beggars and thieves?

746
01:26:41,404 --> 01:26:42,571
We've done that.

747
01:26:42,655 --> 01:26:45,032
If you want to give away the best gladiators

748
01:26:45,116 --> 01:26:46,283
in the whole of the empire,

749
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:48,493
then I want double the rates.

750
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:52,372
You'll get your contract rates, or you'll get your contract canceled.

751
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:53,874
You don't like it?

752
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:57,919
Then you can crawl back down that shit hole that you came from.

753
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:03,175
Cassius, please. You can free us.

754
01:27:32,997 --> 01:27:36,124
Gladiator, are you the one they call the Spaniard?

755
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:37,334
Yes.

756
01:27:38,127 --> 01:27:40,337
They said you were a giant.

757
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:43,590
They said you could crush a mars skull with one hand.

758
01:27:43,674 --> 01:27:45,425
A mars? No.

759
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:48,095
A boy's.

760
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:53,642
- Do they have good horses in Spain? - Some of the best.

761
01:27:54,685 --> 01:27:57,771
This is Argento and this is Scan'to.

762
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:00,982
They were my horses.

763
01:28:01,901 --> 01:28:03,985
They were taken from me.

764
01:28:04,278 --> 01:28:07,572
I like you, Spaniard. I shall cheer for you.

765
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:11,451
- They let you watch the games? - My uncle says it makes me strong.

766
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:14,830
- And what does your father say? - My father is dead.

767
01:28:16,582 --> 01:28:18,667
Master Lucius, it is time.

768
01:28:19,919 --> 01:28:21,294
I have to go.

769
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,963
Your name is Lucius?

770
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:27,759
Lucius Verus, after my father.

771
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:00,125
Lower!

772
01:29:05,256 --> 01:29:08,175
- Claudius! - Yes?

773
01:29:08,259 --> 01:29:10,677
- More shields! - All right.

774
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:34,534
When the Emperor enters, raise your weapons, salute him,

775
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:36,661
and then speak together.

776
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:40,957
Face the Emperor and don't turn your back on him.

777
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:44,920
Go, and die with honor.

778
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:42,060
Hail, mighty Caesar!

779
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:49,526
- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! - Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

780
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:55,532
- We who are about to die salute you! - We who are about to die salute you!

781
01:30:57,243 --> 01:30:58,827
On this day

782
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:02,539
we reach back to hallowed antiquity

783
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:07,085
to bring you a re-creation of the second fall

784
01:31:07,169 --> 01:31:09,212
of mighty Can'thage!

785
01:31:12,925 --> 01:31:17,345
On the barren plain of Zama

786
01:31:17,972 --> 01:31:21,057
there stood the invincible armies

787
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:24,060
of the barbarian Hannibal.

788
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:27,939
Ferocious mercenaries and warriors

789
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:30,400
from all brute nations,

790
01:31:30,484 --> 01:31:34,779
bent on merciless destruction,

791
01:31:35,656 --> 01:31:37,032
conquest.

792
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:41,995
Your emperor is pleased to give you

793
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:45,123
the barbarian horde!

794
01:31:53,466 --> 01:31:55,467
Anyone here been in the army?

795
01:31:55,551 --> 01:31:58,470
Yes. I served with you at Vindobona.

796
01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:01,097
You can help me.

797
01:32:02,391 --> 01:32:04,934
Whatever comes out of these gates,

798
01:32:05,686 --> 01:32:09,481
we've got a better chance of survival ifwe work together.

799
01:32:09,565 --> 01:32:11,274
Do you understand?

800
01:32:13,402 --> 01:32:15,445
Lfwe stay together, we survive.

801
01:32:15,529 --> 01:32:18,656
The Emperor is pleased to bring you the legionnaires

802
01:32:18,741 --> 01:32:22,327
of Scipio Africanus!

803
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:34,839
To the death!

804
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:41,221
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! - Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

805
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:46,643
Stay close.

806
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:54,526
Come together!

807
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:59,906
Stay close. Staggered columns!

808
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:15,171
You don't have a chance.

809
01:33:26,517 --> 01:33:29,060
Lock your shields. Stay as one.

810
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:32,147
Hold!

811
01:33:34,191 --> 01:33:37,193
Hold! As one!

812
01:33:40,114 --> 01:33:41,448
Well done.

813
01:33:53,335 --> 01:33:57,172
Hold. Down low!

814
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:04,179
Yes!

815
01:34:16,275 --> 01:34:17,525
Hagen!

816
01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:45,178
This column to the chariot! This column stay with me!

817
01:34:48,807 --> 01:34:50,183
Quickly!

818
01:34:50,851 --> 01:34:53,603
- Get out there. - Hurry!

819
01:35:34,812 --> 01:35:35,979
Maximus!

820
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:50,618
Single column! Single column!

821
01:36:35,914 --> 01:36:37,332
We win!

822
01:36:42,713 --> 01:36:45,214
My history's a little hazy, Cassius,

823
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:48,968
but shouldn't the barbarians lose the battle of Can'thage?

824
01:36:49,053 --> 01:36:50,803
Yes, sire.

825
01:36:52,723 --> 01:36:54,098
Forgive me, sire.

826
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:56,893
No, I rather enjoy surprises.

827
01:36:57,686 --> 01:36:58,811
Who is he?

828
01:36:58,896 --> 01:37:01,898
They call him the Spaniard, sire.

829
01:37:04,401 --> 01:37:06,319
I think I'll meet him.

830
01:37:06,403 --> 01:37:07,737
Yes, sire.

831
01:37:09,948 --> 01:37:11,866
Hail to the barbarians!

832
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:30,218
Forward! Arms at ready!

833
01:37:43,774 --> 01:37:45,441
Drop your weapons.

834
01:37:49,446 --> 01:37:52,407
Gladiator, the Emperor has asked for you.

835
01:37:52,991 --> 01:37:55,243
I am at the Emperor's service.

836
01:38:21,937 --> 01:38:24,063
Rise. Rise.

837
01:38:33,407 --> 01:38:35,658
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard.

838
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:38,244
I don't think there's ever been a gladiator to match you.

839
01:38:38,328 --> 01:38:41,247
As for this young man, he insists you are Hector reborn.

840
01:38:41,331 --> 01:38:42,915
Or was it Hercules?

841
01:38:44,334 --> 01:38:48,171
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself and tell us all your real name?

842
01:38:50,215 --> 01:38:51,841
You do have a name.

843
01:38:52,634 --> 01:38:54,510
My name is Gladiator.

844
01:38:57,806 --> 01:39:00,975
How dare you show your back to me? Slave!

845
01:39:02,352 --> 01:39:05,688
You will remove your helmet and tell me your name.

846
01:39:17,451 --> 01:39:19,952
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius,

847
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:22,288
commander of the armies of the north,

848
01:39:22,372 --> 01:39:24,707
general of the Felix Legions,

849
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:28,085
loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius,

850
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:31,672
father to a murdered son,

851
01:39:32,132 --> 01:39:34,425
husband to a murdered wife,

852
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:38,513
and I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.

853
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:46,896
Arms!

854
01:39:59,993 --> 01:40:03,329
Live! Live! Live! Live!

855
01:40:03,413 --> 01:40:06,624
- Live! Live! Live! Live! - Live! Live! Live! Live!

856
01:40:50,627 --> 01:40:53,337
Arms, at rest!

857
01:41:45,849 --> 01:41:50,311
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! - Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

858
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:39,568
Father.

859
01:43:53,935 --> 01:43:55,811
Why is he still alive?

860
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:58,564
I don't know.

861
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:00,649
He shouldn't be alive.

862
01:44:01,485 --> 01:44:02,902
It vexes me.

863
01:44:04,654 --> 01:44:06,447
I'm terribly vexed.

864
01:44:17,667 --> 01:44:19,585
I did what I had to do.

865
01:44:20,337 --> 01:44:24,381
If Father had had his way, the empire would have been torn apart.

866
01:44:24,466 --> 01:44:26,133
You do see that.

867
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:27,676
Yes.

868
01:44:32,474 --> 01:44:35,684
What did you feel when you saw him?

869
01:44:37,813 --> 01:44:39,438
I felt nothing.

870
01:44:41,399 --> 01:44:43,943
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

871
01:44:44,986 --> 01:44:47,196
No more than I wounded him.

872
01:44:51,701 --> 01:44:53,994
They lied to me in Germania.

873
01:44:55,622 --> 01:44:57,706
They told me he was dead.

874
01:44:59,709 --> 01:45:02,294
If they lie to me, they don't respect me.

875
01:45:02,379 --> 01:45:05,714
If they don't respect me, how can they ever love me?

876
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:09,426
Then you must let the legions know

877
01:45:09,511 --> 01:45:12,596
their treachery will not go unpunished.

878
01:45:13,431 --> 01:45:14,890
Poor sister.

879
01:45:15,308 --> 01:45:17,768
I wouldn't want to be your enemy.

880
01:45:18,979 --> 01:45:20,729
What will you do?

881
01:45:33,702 --> 01:45:35,035
This way.

882
01:46:10,405 --> 01:46:13,866
Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions.

883
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:16,452
I knew your brother would send assassins.

884
01:46:16,953 --> 01:46:19,580
I didn't realize he would send his best.

885
01:46:21,207 --> 01:46:23,292
Maximus, he doesn't know.

886
01:46:24,252 --> 01:46:27,379
My family was burnt and crucified while they were still alive.

887
01:46:27,464 --> 01:46:30,007
- I knew nothing... - Don't lie to me!

888
01:46:36,473 --> 01:46:38,223
I wept for them.

889
01:46:38,308 --> 01:46:42,144
As you wept for your father? As you wept for your father?

890
01:46:42,228 --> 01:46:45,814
I have been living in a prison of fear since that day.

891
01:46:46,316 --> 01:46:50,152
To be unable to mourn your father for fear of your brother.

892
01:46:51,029 --> 01:46:54,239
To live in terror every moment of every day,

893
01:46:54,324 --> 01:46:57,117
because your son is heir to the throne.

894
01:46:58,995 --> 01:47:00,454
I have wept.

895
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:04,625
My son was innocent.

896
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:07,503
So is mine.

897
01:47:09,506 --> 01:47:12,591
Must my son die, too, before you'll trust me?

898
01:47:14,052 --> 01:47:17,012
What does it matter if I trust you or not?

899
01:47:17,889 --> 01:47:20,933
The gods have spared you. Don't you understand?

900
01:47:21,017 --> 01:47:24,478
Today I saw a slave become more powerful than the emperor of Rome.

901
01:47:24,562 --> 01:47:26,355
The gods have spared me?

902
01:47:26,439 --> 01:47:29,900
I am at their mercy, with the power only to amuse a mob.

903
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:31,527
That is power.

904
01:47:32,028 --> 01:47:33,153
The mob is Rome.

905
01:47:33,238 --> 01:47:36,865
And while Commodus controls them, he controls everything.

906
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:38,742
Listen to me.

907
01:47:39,285 --> 01:47:42,413
My brother has enemies, most of all in the Senate.

908
01:47:42,497 --> 01:47:44,748
But while the people follow him,

909
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:47,876
no one would dare stand up to him until you.

910
01:47:48,837 --> 01:47:51,130
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.

911
01:47:51,214 --> 01:47:54,967
There are some politicians who have dedicated their lives to Rome.

912
01:47:55,051 --> 01:47:56,802
One man above all.

913
01:47:57,887 --> 01:48:00,973
If I can arrange it, will you meet him?

914
01:48:01,307 --> 01:48:03,225
Do you not understand?

915
01:48:03,476 --> 01:48:07,688
I may die in this cell tonight, or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!

916
01:48:07,772 --> 01:48:10,441
What possible difference can I make?

917
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:12,985
This man wants what you want.

918
01:48:13,069 --> 01:48:15,279
Then have him kill Commodus!

919
01:48:17,907 --> 01:48:19,700
I knew a man once,

920
01:48:20,618 --> 01:48:21,910
a noble man.

921
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:25,789
A man of principle who loved my father,

922
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:28,834
and my father loved him.

923
01:48:30,795 --> 01:48:32,963
This man served Rome well.

924
01:48:37,302 --> 01:48:39,011
That man is gone.

925
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:42,306
Your brother did his work well.

926
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:44,058
Let me help you.

927
01:48:49,981 --> 01:48:53,067
Yes, you can help me.

928
01:48:56,404 --> 01:49:00,115
Forget you ever knew me, never come here again.

929
01:49:03,787 --> 01:49:06,538
Guard! The lady is finished with me.

930
01:49:34,984 --> 01:49:36,652
What's your name?

931
01:49:39,656 --> 01:49:41,240
Julian Crassus.

932
01:49:46,746 --> 01:49:47,996
Name?

933
01:49:49,290 --> 01:49:50,791
Marcus, sire.

934
01:49:51,709 --> 01:49:53,418
My father's name.

935
01:50:00,927 --> 01:50:03,095
They must have known of Maximus' escape,

936
01:50:03,179 --> 01:50:06,014
when they found the bodies of the four men.

937
01:50:06,474 --> 01:50:09,059
They thought it was a barbarian raid.

938
01:50:10,103 --> 01:50:13,272
These are good men, sire. Loyal to the Emperor.

939
01:50:20,613 --> 01:50:22,322
Load your arrows!

940
01:50:29,956 --> 01:50:31,874
Prepare to fire!

941
01:50:52,395 --> 01:50:55,689
Then perhaps it was you who knew,

942
01:50:56,524 --> 01:50:58,233
and never told me.

943
01:50:58,484 --> 01:51:00,736
- I didn't know. - You didn't know?

944
01:51:02,238 --> 01:51:05,073
But a general is always in control.

945
01:51:06,451 --> 01:51:10,120
Always in command, isn't he?

946
01:51:11,664 --> 01:51:13,123
Yes, Caesar.

947
01:51:27,055 --> 01:51:29,765
Then give the command. Say it.

948
01:51:46,658 --> 01:51:47,783
Fire.

949
01:52:23,027 --> 01:52:24,361
Maximus.

950
01:52:25,113 --> 01:52:28,240
You commanded legions? You had many victories?

951
01:52:29,117 --> 01:52:31,326
- Yes. - In Germania?

952
01:52:33,246 --> 01:52:34,997
In many countries.

953
01:52:36,582 --> 01:52:37,916
General.

954
01:53:27,008 --> 01:53:28,884
You have a great name.

955
01:53:30,386 --> 01:53:33,430
He must kill your name before he kills you.

956
01:53:42,398 --> 01:53:43,732
Yes, at the far end.

957
01:53:43,816 --> 01:53:45,734
- Senator Gaius. - Hello.

958
01:53:46,235 --> 01:53:48,195
Senator Gracchus.

959
01:53:49,781 --> 01:53:53,200
Don't often see you enjoying the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.

960
01:53:53,284 --> 01:53:56,411
I don't pretend to be a man of the people, Senator,

961
01:53:56,496 --> 01:53:59,039
but I do try to be a man for the people.

962
01:54:15,264 --> 01:54:20,519
- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! - Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

963
01:54:25,024 --> 01:54:26,650
People of Rome!

964
01:54:28,945 --> 01:54:31,405
On the fourth day ofAntioch,

965
01:54:32,031 --> 01:54:36,410
we can celebrate the 64th day of the games.

966
01:54:37,036 --> 01:54:41,289
And in his majestic charity,

967
01:54:42,041 --> 01:54:46,253
the Emperor has deigned this day to favor the people of Rome

968
01:54:46,838 --> 01:54:50,257
with an historical final match.

969
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:55,637
Returning to the Colosseum today, after five years in retirement,

970
01:54:57,056 --> 01:55:00,517
Caesar is pleased to bring you

971
01:55:00,601 --> 01:55:04,396
the only undefeated champion

972
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:06,440
in Roman history,

973
01:55:06,524 --> 01:55:11,445
the legendary Tigris of Gaul!

974
01:55:33,009 --> 01:55:36,178
He knows too well how to manipulate the mob.

975
01:55:36,262 --> 01:55:38,972
Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Rome, Proximo.

976
01:55:39,056 --> 01:55:41,850
This is not it. This is not it!

977
01:55:41,934 --> 01:55:44,769
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.

978
01:55:45,605 --> 01:55:48,190
We mortals are but shadows and dust.

979
01:55:48,858 --> 01:55:50,984
Shadows and dust, Maximus!

980
01:55:51,068 --> 01:55:54,946
Representing the training lyceum ofAntonius Proximo,

981
01:55:55,031 --> 01:55:58,700
Caesar is proud to give you

982
01:55:58,784 --> 01:56:02,621
Aelius Maximus!

983
01:56:15,426 --> 01:56:17,802
They embrace him like he's one of their own.

984
01:56:17,887 --> 01:56:21,806
The mob is fickle, brother. He'll be forgotten in a month.

985
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:27,395
No, much sooner than that.

986
01:56:29,315 --> 01:56:31,107
It's been arranged.

987
01:56:49,627 --> 01:56:52,587
We who are about to die salute you.

988
01:56:55,925 --> 01:56:57,717
We're with you, Maximus!

989
01:57:40,303 --> 01:57:42,095
Fight on, finish it!

990
01:58:10,333 --> 01:58:12,000
Pull, pull!

991
01:58:44,367 --> 01:58:45,909
Loose! Loose!

992
01:59:14,021 --> 01:59:16,106
- Gut him! - Kill!

993
01:59:17,566 --> 01:59:21,152
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! - Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

994
01:59:41,590 --> 01:59:43,633
- Kill! - Kill!

995
02:00:21,505 --> 02:00:23,715
Maximus the Merciful!

996
02:00:32,892 --> 02:00:38,646
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! - Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

997
02:00:45,863 --> 02:00:48,490
Forward, arms at ready!

998
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:20,855
What am I going to do with you?

999
02:01:22,024 --> 02:01:25,485
You simply won't die.

1000
02:01:30,241 --> 02:01:32,617
Are we so different, you and I?

1001
02:01:33,744 --> 02:01:36,663
You take life when you have to, as I do.

1002
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:41,709
I have only one more life to take. Then it is done.

1003
02:01:42,253 --> 02:01:44,003
Then take it now.

1004
02:01:57,059 --> 02:01:59,060
They tell me your son

1005
02:01:59,854 --> 02:02:03,773
squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross.

1006
02:02:05,901 --> 02:02:07,569
And your wife

1007
02:02:08,821 --> 02:02:10,738
moaned like a whore

1008
02:02:11,866 --> 02:02:16,411
when they ravaged her again and again

1009
02:02:17,746 --> 02:02:19,163
and again.

1010
02:02:24,420 --> 02:02:28,172
The time for honoring yourself will soon be at an end,

1011
02:02:32,761 --> 02:02:34,137
Highness.

1012
02:03:01,665 --> 02:03:07,462
General! General!

1013
02:03:09,506 --> 02:03:11,299
- General! - Cicero!

1014
02:03:18,766 --> 02:03:20,266
- General! - Where are you camped?

1015
02:03:20,351 --> 02:03:21,643
Ostia.

1016
02:03:28,108 --> 02:03:31,069
- We love you, Maximus! - Praise the victor!

1017
02:03:31,153 --> 02:03:33,655
Tell the men their general lives. Find me.

1018
02:03:33,822 --> 02:03:35,615
- Move along! - Find me!

1019
02:04:01,475 --> 02:04:03,434
Can they hear you?

1020
02:04:07,022 --> 02:04:10,525
- Who? - Your family, in the afterlife.

1021
02:04:13,028 --> 02:04:15,363
- Yes. - What do you say to them?

1022
02:04:19,243 --> 02:04:20,702
To my boy,

1023
02:04:22,538 --> 02:04:25,081
I tell him I will see him again soon,

1024
02:04:25,165 --> 02:04:28,751
and to keep his heels down when he's riding his horse.

1025
02:04:30,045 --> 02:04:31,546
To my wife,

1026
02:04:34,049 --> 02:04:36,175
that is not your business.

1027
02:04:43,851 --> 02:04:46,728
And now they love Maximus for his mercy.

1028
02:04:48,105 --> 02:04:51,649
So I can'tjust kill him, or it makes me even more unmerciful.

1029
02:04:52,985 --> 02:04:57,238
The whole thing is like some great nightmare.

1030
02:04:58,490 --> 02:05:00,324
He is defying you.

1031
02:05:00,409 --> 02:05:03,786
His every victory is an act of defiance.

1032
02:05:03,871 --> 02:05:07,457
The mob sees this, and so do the Senate.

1033
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:11,127
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.

1034
02:05:12,671 --> 02:05:14,422
- Kill him. - No.

1035
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:18,760
I will not make a martyr of him.

1036
02:05:25,893 --> 02:05:28,352
When I went to the Senate today,

1037
02:05:28,437 --> 02:05:32,899
I purposefully told them about using the grain reserves to pay for the games.

1038
02:05:34,818 --> 02:05:36,986
And did you note what happened?

1039
02:05:37,071 --> 02:05:40,281
- Nothing. - Exactly. Nothing.

1040
02:05:41,283 --> 02:05:43,618
Not a single word of protest.

1041
02:05:43,702 --> 02:05:47,330
Even the insolent Senator Gracchus was silent as a mouse.

1042
02:05:47,414 --> 02:05:48,581
Why?

1043
02:05:50,292 --> 02:05:54,003
I have been told of a certain sea snake

1044
02:05:54,088 --> 02:05:58,132
which has a very unusual method of attracting its prey.

1045
02:05:58,592 --> 02:06:02,303
It will lie at the bottom of the ocean as ifwounded.

1046
02:06:03,263 --> 02:06:05,598
Then its enemies will approach,

1047
02:06:05,682 --> 02:06:08,768
and yet it will lie quite still.

1048
02:06:09,103 --> 02:06:12,897
And then its enemies will take little bites of it,

1049
02:06:12,981 --> 02:06:16,275
and yet it remains still.

1050
02:06:19,488 --> 02:06:20,655
So,

1051
02:06:21,990 --> 02:06:23,783
we will lie still,

1052
02:06:24,493 --> 02:06:27,829
and let our enemies come to us and nibble.

1053
02:06:28,997 --> 02:06:31,249
Have every senator followed.

1054
02:06:48,892 --> 02:06:50,643
Cicero, my old friend.

1055
02:06:50,727 --> 02:06:52,603
I thought perhaps I'd seen you for the last time.

1056
02:06:52,688 --> 02:06:55,231
- I thought you were dead. - Close.

1057
02:06:55,315 --> 02:06:56,941
How long have the men been in Ostia?

1058
02:06:57,025 --> 02:06:58,359
All winter.

1059
02:06:58,694 --> 02:07:01,988
- And how do they look? - Fat and bored.

1060
02:07:02,698 --> 02:07:05,741
- Who's in command? - Some fool from Rome.

1061
02:07:07,369 --> 02:07:09,203
How soon do you think they could be ready to fight?

1062
02:07:09,288 --> 02:07:11,080
For you, tomorrow.

1063
02:07:12,541 --> 02:07:15,042
I need you to do something for me.

1064
02:07:19,673 --> 02:07:21,090
Come, see, witness.

1065
02:07:21,175 --> 02:07:24,218
If you haven't been in the arena, you can see the show here.

1066
02:07:24,303 --> 02:07:27,930
Giant Maximus is defeating our emperor, Commodus.

1067
02:07:28,015 --> 02:07:30,641
What are we to do? He's just defying everyone,

1068
02:07:30,726 --> 02:07:32,393
by doing this to him, they do...

1069
02:07:33,645 --> 02:07:34,979
My goodness!

1070
02:07:36,773 --> 02:07:40,359
- He got him, he's defeated. - Give way!

1071
02:07:46,450 --> 02:07:49,035
My lady? I served your father at Vindobona.

1072
02:07:49,119 --> 02:07:50,661
- Back. - My lady.

1073
02:07:50,746 --> 02:07:53,164
I served your father at Vindobona.

1074
02:07:53,248 --> 02:07:54,332
Back!

1075
02:07:54,416 --> 02:07:57,627
And I served General Maximus. I serve him still.

1076
02:07:59,129 --> 02:08:00,713
Stop. Stop.

1077
02:08:01,256 --> 02:08:02,423
Stop!

1078
02:08:03,342 --> 02:08:04,759
Stand back.

1079
02:08:06,053 --> 02:08:09,096
The general sends word, he will meet your politician.

1080
02:08:10,807 --> 02:08:14,101
- For your loyalty, soldier. - Thank you, my lady.

1081
02:08:23,862 --> 02:08:25,196
Leave us.

1082
02:08:30,911 --> 02:08:32,620
Senator Gracchus.

1083
02:08:46,426 --> 02:08:47,718
General.

1084
02:08:48,804 --> 02:08:51,555
I hope my coming here today is evidence enough

1085
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:54,725
that you can trust me.

1086
02:08:59,022 --> 02:09:01,482
- The Senate is with you? - The Senate?

1087
02:09:02,985 --> 02:09:05,695
Yes. I can speak for them.

1088
02:09:06,321 --> 02:09:09,657
You can buy my freedom and smuggle me out of Rome?

1089
02:09:10,033 --> 02:09:11,492
To what end?

1090
02:09:12,953 --> 02:09:15,288
Get me outside the city walls.

1091
02:09:15,872 --> 02:09:19,750
Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia. My army is encamped there.

1092
02:09:19,835 --> 02:09:23,170
By nightfall of the second day, I shall return at the head of 5,000 men.

1093
02:09:23,255 --> 02:09:25,506
But the legions all have new commanders,

1094
02:09:25,590 --> 02:09:27,008
loyal to Commodus.

1095
02:09:27,092 --> 02:09:30,261
Let my men see me alive, and you shall see where their loyalties lie.

1096
02:09:30,345 --> 02:09:32,013
This is madness.

1097
02:09:32,681 --> 02:09:36,017
No Roman army has entered the capital in 100 years.

1098
02:09:36,101 --> 02:09:38,352
I will not trade one dictatorship for another!

1099
02:09:38,437 --> 02:09:41,981
The time for half measures and talk is over, Senator.

1100
02:09:42,524 --> 02:09:45,609
And after your glorious coup, what then?

1101
02:09:46,820 --> 02:09:50,448
You'll take your 5,000 warriors and leave?

1102
02:09:50,532 --> 02:09:52,074
I will leave.

1103
02:09:52,576 --> 02:09:54,618
The soldiers will stay for your protection,

1104
02:09:54,703 --> 02:09:56,370
under the command of the Senate.

1105
02:09:56,496 --> 02:09:57,663
So,

1106
02:09:57,998 --> 02:10:02,209
once all of Rome is yours, you'll just give it back to the people?

1107
02:10:03,587 --> 02:10:04,587
Tell me why.

1108
02:10:10,719 --> 02:10:13,888
Because that was the last wish of a dying man.

1109
02:10:16,933 --> 02:10:18,809
I will kill Commodus.

1110
02:10:20,729 --> 02:10:23,814
The fate of Rome I leave to you.

1111
02:10:25,567 --> 02:10:27,860
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1112
02:10:29,696 --> 02:10:31,739
His daughter trusts you.

1113
02:10:35,744 --> 02:10:37,411
I will trust you.

1114
02:10:37,829 --> 02:10:39,872
But we have little time.

1115
02:10:40,415 --> 02:10:42,166
Give me two days,

1116
02:10:42,959 --> 02:10:45,211
and I will buy your freedom.

1117
02:10:45,837 --> 02:10:47,171
And you,

1118
02:10:48,715 --> 02:10:50,299
you stay alive,

1119
02:10:51,802 --> 02:10:53,469
or I'll be dead.

1120
02:10:55,430 --> 02:10:57,014
Now we must go.

1121
02:11:24,084 --> 02:11:27,670
He'll be waiting for you. Stand at the foot of the colossus.

1122
02:11:27,754 --> 02:11:29,338
He'll find you.

1123
02:12:13,508 --> 02:12:14,967
It won't work.

1124
02:12:15,927 --> 02:12:18,053
The Emperor knows too much.

1125
02:12:18,805 --> 02:12:19,805
And as for me,

1126
02:12:22,142 --> 02:12:24,185
it's becoming dangerous.

1127
02:12:25,478 --> 02:12:27,730
You'll be paid on my return.

1128
02:12:29,816 --> 02:12:31,609
I give you my word.

1129
02:12:31,860 --> 02:12:34,945
Your word? What if you don't return?

1130
02:12:36,198 --> 02:12:39,158
Do you remember what it was to have trust, Proximo?

1131
02:12:39,242 --> 02:12:40,492
Trust?

1132
02:12:44,748 --> 02:12:46,498
Who am I to trust?

1133
02:12:47,083 --> 02:12:50,252
- I will kill Commodus. - Why would I want that?

1134
02:12:51,046 --> 02:12:52,755
He makes me rich.

1135
02:12:57,886 --> 02:13:00,721
I know that you are a man of your word, General.

1136
02:13:02,474 --> 02:13:05,059
I know that you would die for honor.

1137
02:13:06,394 --> 02:13:08,354
You would die for Rome.

1138
02:13:09,397 --> 02:13:12,524
You would die for the memory of your ancestors.

1139
02:13:12,609 --> 02:13:14,902
But I, on the other hand,

1140
02:13:17,614 --> 02:13:19,448
I'm an entertainer.

1141
02:13:22,953 --> 02:13:24,161
Guard!

1142
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,585
He killed the man who set you free.

1143
02:13:40,762 --> 02:13:42,596
Praetorians, master.

1144
02:13:48,770 --> 02:13:49,937
Halt!

1145
02:14:55,086 --> 02:14:56,879
Where have you been?

1146
02:14:57,339 --> 02:14:58,922
I sent for you.

1147
02:15:00,508 --> 02:15:02,176
Please, brother.

1148
02:15:07,932 --> 02:15:09,808
What's troubling you?

1149
02:15:12,228 --> 02:15:14,605
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

1150
02:15:16,399 --> 02:15:17,900
I don't know.

1151
02:15:19,903 --> 02:15:22,029
I thought you'd seen him.

1152
02:15:22,864 --> 02:15:25,366
He infects everyone like a putrid fever.

1153
02:15:27,202 --> 02:15:30,412
For the health of Rome, the Senate must be bled.

1154
02:15:30,830 --> 02:15:32,873
And he will bleed, too.

1155
02:15:33,750 --> 02:15:35,125
Very soon.

1156
02:15:36,628 --> 02:15:38,295
But not tonight.

1157
02:15:53,311 --> 02:15:56,230
Do you remember what our father said once?

1158
02:15:57,565 --> 02:15:59,233
"It's a dream,

1159
02:16:01,111 --> 02:16:03,028
"a frightful dream,

1160
02:16:05,573 --> 02:16:06,907
"life is."

1161
02:16:09,619 --> 02:16:11,703
Do you think that's true?

1162
02:16:12,455 --> 02:16:13,956
I don't know.

1163
02:16:17,544 --> 02:16:19,086
I think it is.

1164
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:24,591
And I have only you to share it with.

1165
02:17:02,172 --> 02:17:03,797
Open your mouth.

1166
02:17:41,085 --> 02:17:42,878
You know I love you.

1167
02:17:44,964 --> 02:17:46,548
And I love you.

1168
02:18:23,211 --> 02:18:24,753
Out. Get out!

1169
02:18:25,964 --> 02:18:27,214
Move!

1170
02:18:31,886 --> 02:18:33,929
Congratulations, General.

1171
02:18:34,013 --> 02:18:36,807
You've got very persuasive friends.

1172
02:18:42,814 --> 02:18:45,315
My brother has had Gracchus arrested.

1173
02:18:45,400 --> 02:18:48,860
We daren't wait any longer. We must leave tonight.

1174
02:18:48,945 --> 02:18:52,573
Proximo will come at midnight and take you to the gate.

1175
02:18:53,241 --> 02:18:56,910
Your servant, Cicero, will be waiting there with horses.

1176
02:18:58,913 --> 02:19:01,206
- You have done all this? - Yes.

1177
02:19:02,417 --> 02:19:04,126
You risk too much.

1178
02:19:05,086 --> 02:19:07,087
I have much to pay for.

1179
02:19:09,507 --> 02:19:11,717
You have nothing to pay for.

1180
02:19:11,801 --> 02:19:14,886
You love your son. You're strong for him.

1181
02:19:18,099 --> 02:19:20,434
I am tired of being strong.

1182
02:19:22,395 --> 02:19:26,607
My brother hates all the world, and you most of all.

1183
02:19:27,108 --> 02:19:30,235
- Because your father chose me. - No.

1184
02:19:31,529 --> 02:19:33,780
Because my father loved you.

1185
02:19:37,702 --> 02:19:40,120
And because I loved you.

1186
02:19:42,707 --> 02:19:44,374
A long time ago.

1187
02:19:49,130 --> 02:19:51,256
Was I very different then?

1188
02:19:57,805 --> 02:19:59,556
You laughed more.

1189
02:20:03,645 --> 02:20:06,063
I have felt alone all my life,

1190
02:20:07,357 --> 02:20:09,024
except with you.

1191
02:20:12,111 --> 02:20:13,487
I must go.

1192
02:20:14,155 --> 02:20:15,280
Yes.

1193
02:20:43,768 --> 02:20:44,976
There.

1194
02:20:56,531 --> 02:20:58,031
And I got you.

1195
02:21:01,077 --> 02:21:02,994
Isn't it late to be playing legionnaire?

1196
02:21:03,079 --> 02:21:05,163
I'm not a legionnaire.

1197
02:21:05,498 --> 02:21:08,083
- Not a legionnaire? - I'm a gladiator.

1198
02:21:09,377 --> 02:21:10,836
A gladiator?

1199
02:21:11,546 --> 02:21:14,214
Gladiators only fight in the games.

1200
02:21:14,298 --> 02:21:17,718
Wouldrt you rather be a great Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?

1201
02:21:17,802 --> 02:21:20,387
I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!

1202
02:21:23,224 --> 02:21:25,058
The savior of Rome?

1203
02:21:33,067 --> 02:21:34,776
And who said that?

1204
02:21:43,619 --> 02:21:45,203
Where's Lucius?

1205
02:21:46,414 --> 02:21:48,832
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

1206
02:21:51,753 --> 02:21:53,462
- She couldn't. - Yes, she did.

1207
02:21:53,546 --> 02:21:55,756
She took it from a basket,

1208
02:21:57,175 --> 02:22:00,927
and pressed it to her breast, right here above her heart.

1209
02:22:02,555 --> 02:22:05,766
- It bit her in the breast? - Yes.

1210
02:22:06,434 --> 02:22:10,395
You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies

1211
02:22:10,897 --> 02:22:14,858
behave very strangely and do very odd things in the name of love.

1212
02:22:14,942 --> 02:22:17,527
- I think it's silly. - So do I.

1213
02:22:19,614 --> 02:22:20,947
So do I.

1214
02:22:21,491 --> 02:22:23,575
Sister, join us.

1215
02:22:24,202 --> 02:22:25,952
I've been reading to dear Lucius.

1216
02:22:26,037 --> 02:22:28,038
- I've been reading, too. - Yes.

1217
02:22:28,122 --> 02:22:32,459
He's a very clever little boy. He'll make a grand emperor one day.

1218
02:22:34,003 --> 02:22:36,421
We've been reading about the great Mark Antony,

1219
02:22:36,506 --> 02:22:37,839
and his adventures in Egypt.

1220
02:22:37,924 --> 02:22:40,467
And the queen killed herself with a snake.

1221
02:22:40,551 --> 02:22:43,887
And just wait until you hear what happened to our ancestors.

1222
02:22:43,971 --> 02:22:45,806
If you're very good,

1223
02:22:45,890 --> 02:22:49,684
tomorrow night, I'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius.

1224
02:22:49,769 --> 02:22:51,478
He was betrayed

1225
02:22:52,688 --> 02:22:54,815
by those closest to him.

1226
02:22:56,692 --> 02:22:58,443
By his own blood.

1227
02:22:59,779 --> 02:23:02,239
They whispered in dark corners

1228
02:23:02,323 --> 02:23:04,783
and went out late at night,

1229
02:23:04,867 --> 02:23:08,203
and conspired, and conspired.

1230
02:23:10,832 --> 02:23:14,668
But the Emperor Claudius knew that they were up to something.

1231
02:23:14,794 --> 02:23:17,337
He knew they were busy little bees.

1232
02:23:19,298 --> 02:23:22,342
And one night he sat down with one of them,

1233
02:23:23,135 --> 02:23:25,136
and he looked at her,

1234
02:23:25,888 --> 02:23:27,430
and he said,

1235
02:23:28,599 --> 02:23:31,184
"Tell me what you've been doing,

1236
02:23:31,853 --> 02:23:33,562
"busy little bee.

1237
02:23:35,857 --> 02:23:38,942
"Or I shall strike down those dearest to you.

1238
02:23:40,111 --> 02:23:43,154
"You shall watch as I bathe in their blood."

1239
02:23:46,868 --> 02:23:49,286
And the Emperor was heartbroken.

1240
02:23:51,372 --> 02:23:53,582
The little bee had wounded him more deeply

1241
02:23:53,666 --> 02:23:56,376
than anyone else could ever have done.

1242
02:23:58,504 --> 02:24:01,381
What do you think happened then, Lucius?

1243
02:24:02,008 --> 02:24:03,842
I don't know, Uncle.

1244
02:24:10,349 --> 02:24:12,934
The little bee told him everything.

1245
02:25:10,826 --> 02:25:13,828
Open, in the name of the Emperor!

1246
02:25:14,664 --> 02:25:15,955
Proximo!

1247
02:25:16,832 --> 02:25:19,959
Open the gates, in the name of the Emperor!

1248
02:25:20,795 --> 02:25:22,128
Proximo!

1249
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:25,799
Open the gates!

1250
02:25:31,639 --> 02:25:33,932
Open the gates, Proximo.

1251
02:25:34,392 --> 02:25:36,643
Do you want to die, old man?

1252
02:25:37,853 --> 02:25:38,978
Here.

1253
02:25:39,563 --> 02:25:41,731
Everything is prepared.

1254
02:25:41,816 --> 02:25:44,275
It seems you have won your freedom.

1255
02:25:44,360 --> 02:25:47,946
Proximo, are you in danger of becoming a good man?

1256
02:25:53,035 --> 02:25:56,871
- Juba. - All enemies of the Emperor die!

1257
02:25:57,415 --> 02:25:59,582
Open the gates!

1258
02:26:05,089 --> 02:26:07,048
Pull!

1259
02:26:09,176 --> 02:26:12,053
Move! Form a column on the left!

1260
02:26:15,850 --> 02:26:19,060
I only need moments, so do not be careless with your lives.

1261
02:26:19,145 --> 02:26:21,604
If you don't want any part of this, go back to your cells.

1262
02:26:21,689 --> 02:26:23,940
We'll wait here for you, Maximus.

1263
02:26:24,024 --> 02:26:25,817
- Strength and honor. - Strength and honor.

1264
02:26:25,901 --> 02:26:26,943
Go.

1265
02:26:27,820 --> 02:26:29,654
Strength and honor.

1266
02:26:32,283 --> 02:26:35,118
Aim. Arch your bows!

1267
02:27:42,228 --> 02:27:43,520
Shadows and dust.

1268
02:28:25,437 --> 02:28:26,688
Maximus!

1269
02:28:32,152 --> 02:28:33,570
I'm sorry.

1270
02:28:59,972 --> 02:29:01,347
It's done.

1271
02:29:08,314 --> 02:29:10,189
And what of my nephew?

1272
02:29:11,275 --> 02:29:13,276
And what of his mother?

1273
02:29:15,362 --> 02:29:17,906
Should they share her lover's fate?

1274
02:29:19,617 --> 02:29:21,659
Or should I be merciful?

1275
02:29:24,371 --> 02:29:26,289
Commodus the Merciful.

1276
02:29:32,713 --> 02:29:35,048
Lucius will stay with me now.

1277
02:29:36,216 --> 02:29:38,009
And if his mother

1278
02:29:39,386 --> 02:29:41,512
so much as looks at me

1279
02:29:42,681 --> 02:29:45,183
in a manner that displeases me,

1280
02:29:47,144 --> 02:29:48,561
he will die.

1281
02:29:52,066 --> 02:29:55,318
If she decides to be noble,

1282
02:29:57,071 --> 02:29:59,155
and takes her own life,

1283
02:30:00,741 --> 02:30:02,200
he will die.

1284
02:30:05,829 --> 02:30:07,538
And as for you,

1285
02:30:10,334 --> 02:30:12,085
you will love me,

1286
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:14,712
as I have loved you.

1287
02:30:16,298 --> 02:30:19,968
You will provide me with an heir of pure blood,

1288
02:30:20,928 --> 02:30:22,762
so that Commodus

1289
02:30:23,347 --> 02:30:26,307
and his progeny will rule for 1,000 years.

1290
02:30:30,938 --> 02:30:32,689
Am I not merciful?

1291
02:30:54,545 --> 02:30:57,171
Am I not merciful!

1292
02:31:09,393 --> 02:31:13,396
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! - Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1293
02:31:40,841 --> 02:31:43,593
I'm a soldier. I obey.

1294
02:31:46,346 --> 02:31:50,600
Nothing happens to anyone that he is not fitted by nature to bear.

1295
02:32:23,550 --> 02:32:29,514
Maximus.

1296
02:32:31,225 --> 02:32:33,059
They call for you.

1297
02:32:35,020 --> 02:32:38,272
The general who became a slave.

1298
02:32:39,525 --> 02:32:41,901
The slave who became a gladiator.

1299
02:32:43,278 --> 02:32:46,072
The gladiator who defied an emperor.

1300
02:32:48,075 --> 02:32:49,742
A striking story.

1301
02:32:50,911 --> 02:32:54,122
Now the people want to know how the story ends.

1302
02:32:56,500 --> 02:32:58,751
Only a famous death will do.

1303
02:33:00,671 --> 02:33:03,214
And what could be more glorious

1304
02:33:03,590 --> 02:33:07,343
than to challenge the Emperor himself in the great arena?

1305
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:12,723
- You would fight me? - Why not?

1306
02:33:13,809 --> 02:33:15,852
Do you think I'm afraid?

1307
02:33:16,770 --> 02:33:19,814
I think you have been afraid all your life.

1308
02:33:19,898 --> 02:33:23,609
Unlike Maximus the Invincible, who knows no fear?

1309
02:33:29,366 --> 02:33:32,743
I knew a man who once said, "Death smiles at us all.

1310
02:33:33,620 --> 02:33:36,122
"All a man can do is smile back."

1311
02:33:37,916 --> 02:33:39,333
I wonder,

1312
02:33:39,960 --> 02:33:42,753
did your friend smile at his own death?

1313
02:33:43,130 --> 02:33:44,630
You must know.

1314
02:33:47,551 --> 02:33:49,343
He was your father.

1315
02:33:53,223 --> 02:33:55,558
You loved my father, I know,

1316
02:33:57,060 --> 02:33:58,561
but so did I.

1317
02:34:00,189 --> 02:34:02,773
That makes us brothers, doesn't it?

1318
02:34:05,402 --> 02:34:06,986
Smile for me now, brother.

1319
02:34:12,993 --> 02:34:15,828
Strap on his armor. Conceal the wound.

1320
02:35:10,259 --> 02:35:12,218
Ring formation!

1321
02:37:03,997 --> 02:37:05,623
Quintus, sword.

1322
02:37:07,125 --> 02:37:08,918
Give me your sword.

1323
02:37:12,339 --> 02:37:14,340
Sword! Give me a sword!

1324
02:37:15,842 --> 02:37:19,345
Sheathe your swords. Sheathe your swords!

1325
02:39:34,814 --> 02:39:42,821
Maximus.

1326
02:39:43,406 --> 02:39:44,740
Quintus.

1327
02:39:46,409 --> 02:39:47,868
Free my men.

1328
02:39:49,246 --> 02:39:51,956
Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated.

1329
02:39:53,250 --> 02:39:55,334
There was a dream that was Rome.

1330
02:39:56,002 --> 02:39:57,878
It shall be realized.

1331
02:39:58,421 --> 02:40:01,006
These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius.

1332
02:40:02,092 --> 02:40:04,093
Free the prisoners. Go!

1333
02:40:28,868 --> 02:40:30,202
Maximus.

1334
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:33,664
Lucius is safe.

1335
02:40:49,973 --> 02:40:51,390
Go to them.

1336
02:41:41,191 --> 02:41:42,608
You're home.

1337
02:42:09,260 --> 02:42:11,804
Is Rome won'th one good mars life?

1338
02:42:15,684 --> 02:42:17,476
We believed it once.

1339
02:42:20,689 --> 02:42:22,815
Make us believe it again.

1340
02:42:26,319 --> 02:42:28,404
He was a soldier of Rome.

1341
02:42:32,242 --> 02:42:33,659
Honor him.

1342
02:42:34,119 --> 02:42:36,286
Who will help me carry him?

1343
02:43:21,040 --> 02:43:22,708
Now we are free.

1344
02:43:29,090 --> 02:43:30,966
I will see you again.

1345
02:43:33,845 --> 02:43:35,304
But not yet.

1346
02:43:36,306 --> 02:43:42,311
Not yet.
