167
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,826
Can l count on you
when the time comes?

168
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,669
Highness, when your father releases me,
l intend to return home.

169
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:58,005
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.

170
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:03,302
Don't get too comfortable.
l may call on you before long.

171
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,932
Lucilla's here. Did you know?

172
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,351
She's not forgotten you.

173
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,813
And now, you're the great man.

174
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,408
(GASPS)

175
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,828
lf only you had been born a man,

176
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,164
what a Caesar you would have made.

177
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,292
Father.

178
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,134
You would have been strong.

179
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:46,387
l wonder, would you have been just?

180
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,390
l would have been
what you taught me to be.

181
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,599
Oh.

182
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,477
How was yourjourney?

183
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:57,732
Long. Uncomfortable.
Why have l come?

184
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,568
l need your help. With your brother.

185
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,528
Of course.

186
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,905
He loves you. He always has.

187
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,074
And

188
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,204
he will need you now,
more than ever.

189
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,086
Enough of politics.

190
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,423
Let us pretend
that you are a loving daughter

191
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,259
and l am a good father.

192
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,601
This is a pleasant fiction,
isn't it?

193
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,948
SOLDlER: Good morning.

194
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,631
SOLDlER 2: l need three more horses.

195
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,263
(SWORDS CLANKlNG)

196
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,935
Two! Three!

197
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,812
Four!

198
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,606
One! Two!

199
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,332
You sent for me, Caesar?

200
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:46,006
-Caesar?
-Tell me again, Maximus.

201
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,801
Why are we here?

202
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,638
For the glory of the empire, sire.

203
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,181
Yes.

204
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,185
Ah, yes, l remember.

205
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,482
Do you see that map, Maximus?

206
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,819
That is the world which l created.

207
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,280
For 25 years

208
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:13,701
l have conquered, spilt blood,
expanded the empire.

209
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,956
Since l became Caesar,
l've known four years without war.

210
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,500
Four years of peace in 20.

211
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,294
And for what?

212
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,298
(SlGHS)

213
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:34,513
l brought the sword. Nothing more.

214
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,057
Caesar, your life...

215
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,727
Please. Please don't call me that.

216
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,313
Come. Please.

217
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,481
Come sit.

218
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,027
Let us talk together now,

219
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,030
very simply, as men.

220
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,532
Well, Maximus,

221
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,077
talk.

222
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,917
5,000 of my men are out there
in the freezing mud.

223
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,919
3,000 of them
are bloodied and cleaved.

224
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,587
2,000 will never leave this place.

225
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,757
l will not believe that they fought
and died for nothing.

226
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,425
And what would you believe?

227
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:15,346
They fought for you and for Rome.

228
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,264
And what is Rome, Maximus?

229
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,852
l've seen much
of the rest of the world.

230
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,940
lt is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.

231
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,942
Yet you have never been there.

232
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,444
You have not seen
what it has become.

233
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,614
l am dying, Maximus.

234
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,950
When a man sees his end

235
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:39,119
he wants to know there was
some purpose to his life.

236
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,915
How will the world speak my name
in years to come?

237
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,292
Will l be known as the philosopher?

238
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,877
The warrior?

239
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,629
The tyrant?

240
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:54,635
Or will l be the Emperor
who gave Rome back her true self?

241
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,055
There was once a dream
that was Rome.

242
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,975
You could only whisper it.

243
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,228
Anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish,

244
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,063
it was so fragile.

245
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:10,109
And l fear that it will not survive
the winter.

246
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,987
Maximus,

247
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,907
let us whisper now

248
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,909
together, you and l.

249
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,120
You have a son.

250
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,498
Tell me about your home.

251
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,590
My house is in the hills
above Trujillo.

252
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,719
A very simple place.

253
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:40,097
Pink stones that warm in the sun.

254
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:43,684
A kitchen garden
that smells of herbs in the day,

255
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,353
jasmine in the evening.

256
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,566
Through the gate is a giant poplar.

257
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,694
Figs, apples, pears.

258
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,448
The soil, Marcus, black.
Black like my wife's hair.

259
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,615
(CHUCKLES)

260
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,826
Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.

261
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,162
Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son.

262
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,872
(CHUCKLlNG) He wants to be one of them.

263
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,790
When was the last time
you were home?

264
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:10,002
Two years, 264 days
and this morning.

265
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,882
l envy you, Maximus.
lt's a good home.

266
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,344
Worth fighting for.

267
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,265
There is one more duty

268
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,560
that l ask of you
before you go home.

269
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,606
What would you have me do, Caesar?

270
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:34,360
l want you to become
the protector of Rome after l die.

271
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,530
l will empower you
to one end alone,

272
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,576
to give power back
to the people of Rome

273
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,913
and end the corruption
that has crippled it.

274
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:55,881
Will you accept this great honour
that l have offered you?

275
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,134
With all my heart, no.

276
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,430
Maximus,

277
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,934
that is why it must be you.

278
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,144
But surely a prefect, a senator,

279
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,939
somebody who knows the city,
who understands her politics.

280
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:15,067
But you have not been corrupted
by her politics.

281
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:23,617
-And Commodus?
-Commodus is not a moral man.

282
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,079
You have known that
since you were young.

283
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,206
Commodus cannot rule.

284
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,667
He must not rule.

285
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,004
You are the son
that l should have had.

286
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:41,593
Commodus will accept my decision.

287
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:48,517
He knows that you command
the loyalty of the army.

288
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,065
l need some time, sire.

289
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,608
Yes.

290
00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:00,320
By sunset,
l hope you will have agreed.

291
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,490
Now embrace me as my son.

292
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,663
And bring an old man
another blanket.

293
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,348
-LUClLLA: My father favours you now.
-My lady.

294
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,019
-lt was not always so.
-Many things change.

295
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:35,397
Many things. Not everything.

296
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,027
Maximus, stop.

297
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,449
Let me see your face.

298
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,704
-You seem upset.
-l lost many men.

299
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,957
What did my father want with you?

300
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:58,045
To wish me well
before l leave for home.

301
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,172
You're lying.

302
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,673
l could always tell
when you were lying

303
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,800
because you were never
any good at it.

304
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,385
l never acquired
your comfort with it.

305
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,512
True.

306
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,722
But then you never had to.

307
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,892
Life is more simple for a soldier.

308
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,896
Or do you think me heartless?

309
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,650
l think you have
a talent for survival.

310
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,238
(LAUGHS)

311
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,241
Maximus, stop.

312
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,079
ls it really so terrible
seeing me again?

313
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,915
No. l'm tired from battle.

314
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,293
lt hurts you to see
my father so fragile.

315
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:45,509
Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.

316
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,430
Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?

317
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,768
l will always serve Rome.

318
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,480
Do you know,

319
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,108
l still remember you in my prayers.

320
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,987
Oh, yes. l pray.

321
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,869
l was sad to hear of your husband's
death. l mourned him.

322
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,624
-Thank you.
-And l hear you have a son.

323
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,670
Yes. Lucius.

324
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,257
He'll be nearly eight years old.

325
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,634
My son is also nearly eight.

326
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,556
l thank you for your prayers.

327
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,858
MAXlMUS: Ancestors,
l ask for your guidance.

328
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:47,779
Blessed Mother, come to me
with the gods' desire for my future.

329

Ambition.

1469
02:22:48,919 --> 02:22:50,712
He was betrayed

1470
02:22:51,589 --> 02:22:53,715

and conspired, and conspired.

1475
02:23:09,732 --> 02:23:13,651
But the Emperor Claudius knew
that they were up to something.

1476
02:23:13,736 --> 02:23:16,321
He knew they were busy little bees.

1477
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:21,326
And one night he sat down
with one of them

1478
02:23:22,077 --> 02:23:24,078
and he looked at her

1479
02:23:24,997 --> 02:23:26,539
and he said,

1480
02:23:27,583 --> 02:23:30,168
"Tell me what you've been doing,
