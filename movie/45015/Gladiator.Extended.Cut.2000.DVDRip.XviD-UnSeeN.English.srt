1
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,315
Sir.

2
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,833
General.

3
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,109
Sir.

4
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,038
Lean and hungry.

5
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,754
- Still nothing?
- Not a sign.

6
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,230
How long has he been gone?
Nearly two hours.

7
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,198
Will they fight, sir?

8
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,679
We shall know soon enough.

9
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,320
Soldier, I ordered you
to move those catapults forward.

10
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,630
- They're out of range.
- Range is good.

11
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,396
- The danger to the cavalry...
- Is acceptable. Agreed?

12
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,874
They say no.

13
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,034
People should know
when they're conquered.

14
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,798
Would you, Quintus?

15
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,908
Would I?

16
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,554
Strength and honour.

17
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,952
At my signal, unleash hell.

18
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,239
Load the catapults.

19
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,957
Infantry form up for advance.

20
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,669
Archers ready.
Archers!

21
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,159
Nock!

22
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,319
<i>Fratres!</i>

23
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,277
Maximus!

24
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,233
Three weeks from now,
I will be harvesting my crops.

25
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,838
Imagine where you will be, and it will be so.

26
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,717
Hold the line! Stay with me!

27
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,360
If you find yourself alone...

28
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,318
riding in green fields
with the sun on your face...

29
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,556
do not be troubled.

30
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,875
For you are in Elysium,
and you're already dead!

31
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,512
Brothers...

32
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,592
what we do in life...

33
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,517
echoes in eternity.

34
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,588
Pull!

35
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,516
Catapults ready, sir!

36
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,030
Archers, ignite!

37
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,634
Ignite!

38
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,960
Archers, draw!

39
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,594
Loose!

40
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,710
All right, men, ready!

41
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,911
Hold the line!

42
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,876
Loose!

43
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,359
Reload!

44
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,071
Hold the line!

45
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,435
- Draw!
- Loose!

46
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,598
Stay with me!

47
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,836
Stay with me!

48
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,433
<i>Roma victor!</i>

49
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,111
<i>Roma victor!</i>

50
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,114
Do you think he's really dying?

51
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,871
He's been dying for 10 years.

52
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,118
If he weren't really dying,
he wouldn't have sent for us.

53
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,031
Maybe he just misses us.

54
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,680
And the senators?
He wouldn't have summoned them if...

55
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,875
Peace, Commodus.

56
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,839
After two weeks on the road,
your incessant scheming is hurting my head.

57
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,236
He's made his decision.
He's going to announce it.

58
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,551
He will name me.

59
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,790
<i>The first thing I shall do when...</i>

60
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,631
Is honour him with games
worthy of His Majesty.

61
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,350
For now, the first thing I shall do
is have a hot bath.

62
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,712
Your Highness?

63
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,749
We seem to be almost there, sire.

64
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,311
Sire.
Where's the Emperor?

65
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,437
He's at the front, sire.
They've been gone for 19 days.

66
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,110
<i>The wounded are still coming in.</i>

67
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,758
My horse.

68
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,432
My lord.

69
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,875
Kiss?

70
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,636
You have proved your valour yet again,
Maximus.

71
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,394
Let us hope, for the last time.

72
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,990
There's no one left to fight, sire.

73
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,469
There is always someone left to fight.

74
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,478
How can I reward Rome's greatest general?

75
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,153
Let me go home.

76
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,829
Home.

77
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,353
They honour you, Caesar.

78
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,113
It's for you, Maximus. They honour you.

79
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,754
Have I missed it? Have I missed the battle?

80
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,078
You have missed the war.

81
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,276
Father, congratulations.

82
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,029
I shall sacrifice 100 bulls
to honour your triumph.

83
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,712
Save the bulls.

84
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,155
Honour Maximus. He won the battle.

85
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,790
General.
Highness.

86
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,230
Rome salutes you,
and I embrace you as a brother.

87
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,038
It has been too long, my old friend.

88
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,439
Highness.

89
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,028
Here, Father. Take my arm.

90
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,632
I think it is time for me to leave.

91
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,357
So much for the glory of Rome.

92
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,478
Magnificent battle.

93
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,078
General. Still alive?

94
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,388
Still alive.

95
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,038
The gods must have a sense of humour.

96
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,680
The gods must love you.
Valerius.

97
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,433
Back to barracks, General? Or to Rome?

98
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,552
Home. My wife, my son, the harvest.

99
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,357
Maximus the farmer.
I still have difficulty imagining that.

100
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,876
You know, dirt cleans off
a lot easier than blood, Quintus.

101
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,996
- Here he is.
- Highness.

102
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,150
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

103
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,073
Beware of Gaius.
He'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear...

104
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,516
and you'll wake up one day and all
you'll say is, "Republic. "

105
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,160
Well, why not?
Rome was founded as a republic.

106
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,754
Yes, and in a republic
the senate has the power.

107
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,229
But Senator Gaius
isn't influenced by that, of course.

108
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,834
Where do you stand, General?
Emperor or Senate?

109
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,550
A soldier has the advantage of being able
to look his enemy in the eye, Senator.

110
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,714
Well, with an army behind you,
you could be extremely political.

111
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,758
I warned you. Now I shall save you.
Senators.

112
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,593
Maximus.

113
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,035
I'm going to need good men like you.

114
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,514
How may I be of service, Highness?

115
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,114
You're a man who knows what it is
to command.

116
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,751
You give your orders, the orders are obeyed,
and the battle is won.

117
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,436
But these senators scheme, squabble
and flatter and deceive.

118
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,793
We must save Rome
from the politicians, my friend.

119
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,838
Can I count on you when the time comes?

120
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,352
Highness, when your father releases me,
I intend to return home.

121
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,512
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.

122
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,589
Don't get too comfortable.
I may call on you before long.

123
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,028
Lucilla's here. Did you know?

124
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,391
She's not forgotten you.

125
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,676
And now, you're the great man.

126
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,069
If only you had been born a man...

127
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,270
what a Caesar you would have made.

128
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,279
Father.

129
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,791
You would have been strong.

130
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,952
I wonder, would you have been just?

131
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,394
I would have been
what you taught me to be.

132
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,759
How was your journey?

133
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,833
Long. Uncomfortable. Why have I come?

134
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,514
I need your help. With your brother.

135
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,553
Of course.

136
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,710
He loves you. He always has.

137
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,795
And...

138
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,677
he will need you now, more than ever.

139
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,317
Enough of politics.

140
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,518
Let us pretend
that you are a loving daughter...

141
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,195
and I am a good father.

142
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,199
This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?

143
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,118
Good morning.

144
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,995
I need three more horses.

145
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,791
<i>Two! Three!</i>

146
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,634
Four!

147
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,280
One! Two!

148
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,510
You sent for me, Caesar?

149
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,639
- Caesar?
- Tell me again, Maximus.

150
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,318
Why are we here?

151
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,994
For the glory of the empire, sire.

152
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,475
Yes.

153
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,311
Yes, I remember.

154
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,390
Do you see that map, Maximus?

155
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,594
That is the world which I created.

156
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,953
<i>For 25 years...</i>

157
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,229
I have conquered, spilt blood,
expanded the empire.

158
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,235
Since I became Caesar,
I've known four years without war.

159
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,675
Four years of peace in 20.

160
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,393
<i>And for what?</i>

161
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,149
I brought the sword. Nothing more.

162
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,628
Caesar, your life...

163
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,188
Please. Please don't call me that.

164
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,635
Come. Please.

165
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,719
Come sit.

166
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,114
<i>Let us talk together now...</i>

167
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,996
<i>very simply, as men.</i>

168
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,392
Well, Maximus...

169
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,795
talk.

170
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,393
5,000 of my men are out there
in the freezing mud.

171
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,956
3,000 of them are bloodied and cleaved.
2,000 will never leave this place.

172
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,952
I will not believe that they fought
and died for nothing.

173
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,598
And what would you believe?

174
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,355
They fought for you and for Rome.

175
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,158
And what is Rome, Maximus?

176
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,549
I've seen much of the rest of the world.

177
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,474
It is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.

178
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,391
Yet you have never been there.

179
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,789
You have not seen what it has become.

180
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,832
I am dying, Maximus.

181
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,072
<i>When a man sees his end...</i>

182
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,118
<i>he wants to know there was some purpose
to his life.</i>

183
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,752
How will the world speak my name
in years to come?

184
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,075
Will I be known as the philosopher?

185
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,559
The warrior?

186
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,233
The tyrant?

187
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,037
Or will I be the Emperor
who gave Rome back her true self?

188
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,275
There was once a dream
that was Rome.

189
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,079
You could only whisper it.

190
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,197
Anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish...

191
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,952
it was so fragile.

192
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,829
And I fear that it will not survive the winter.

193
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,679
Maximus...

194
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,358
let us whisper now...

195
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,272
together, you and I.

196
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,393
You have a son.

197
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,632
Tell me about your home.

198
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,353
My house is in the hills above Trujillo.

199
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,392
A very simple place.

200
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,633
<i>Pink stones that warm in the sun.</i>

201
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,030
A kitchen garden
that smells of herbs in the day...

202
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,591
jasmine in the evening.

203
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,668
Through the gate is a giant poplar.

204
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,679
Figs, apples, pears.

205
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,469
The soil, Marcus, black.
Black like my wife's hair.

206
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,510
Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.

207
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,750
Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son.

208
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,398
He wants to be one of them.

209
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,232
When was the last time you were home?

210
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,278
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

211
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,991
I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home.

212
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,278
Worth fighting for.

213
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,036
There is one more duty...

214
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,199
that I ask of you before you go home.

215
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,076
What would you have me do, Caesar?

216
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,630
I want you to become
the protector of Rome after I die.

217
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,638
I will empower you to one end alone...

218
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,516
to give power back to the people of Rome...

219
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,758
and end the corruption that has crippled it.

220
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,275
Will you accept this great honour
that I have offered you?

221
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,511
With all my heart, no.

222
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,552
Maximus...

223
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,918
that is why it must be you.

224
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,991
But surely a prefect, a senator...

225
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,548
somebody who knows the city,
who understands her politics.

226
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,712
But you have not been corrupted
by her politics.

227
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,910
- And Commodus?
- Commodus is not a moral man.

228
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,194
You have known that since you were young.

229
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,277
Commodus cannot rule.

230
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,635
He must not rule.

231
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,793
You are the son that I should have had.

232
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,118
Commodus will accept my decision.

233
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,796
He knows that you command
the loyalty of the army.

234
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,073
I need some time, sire.

235
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,559
Yes.

236
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,076
By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.

237
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,150
Now embrace me as my son.

238
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,034
And bring an old man another blanket.

239
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,473
My father favours you now.
My lady.

240
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,472
- It was not always so.
- Many things change.

241
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,757
Many things. Not everything.

242
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,152
Maximus, stop.

243
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,391
Let me see your face.

244
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,678
You seem upset.
I lost many men.

245
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,550
What did my father want with you?

246
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,433
To wish me well before I leave for home.

247
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,513
You're lying.

248
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,036
<i>I could always tell when you were lying
because you were never any good at it.</i>

249
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,554
- I never acquired your comfort with it.
- True.

250
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,676
But then you never had to.

251
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,754
Life is more simple for a soldier.

252
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,596
Or do you think me heartless?

253
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,199
I think you have a talent for survival.

254
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,439
Maximus, stop.

255
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,069
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?

256
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,789
No. I'm tired from battle.

257
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,198
It hurts you to see
my father so fragile.

258
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,993
Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.

259
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,716
Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?

260
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,830
I will always serve Rome.

261
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,432
Do you know...

262
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,909
I still remember you in my prayers.

263
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,673
Oh, yes. I pray.

264
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,231
I was sad to hear of your husband's death.
I mourned him.

265
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,759
- Thank you.
- And I hear you have a son.

266
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,669
Yes. Lucius.

267
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,111
He'll be nearly eight years old.

268
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,350
My son is also nearly eight.

269
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,315
I thank you for your prayers.

270
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,074
Ancestors,
I ask for your guidance.

271
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,710
<i>Blessed Mother, come to me
with the gods' desire for my future.</i>

272
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,869
Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son
with a ready sword.

273
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,191
Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.

274
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,950
<i>Ancestors, I honour you...</i>

275
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,271
and will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.

276
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,559
Cicero.

277
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,869
Sir.

278
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,594
Do you ever find it hard to do your duty?

279
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,708
Sometimes I do what I want to do.

280
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,073
The rest of the time, I do what I have to.

281
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,518
We may not be able to go home, after all.

282
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,193
Are you ready to do your duty
for Rome?

283
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,559
Yes, Father.

284
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,631
You will not be emperor.

285
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,075
Which wiser, older man is to take my place?

286
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,594
My powers will pass to Maximus...

287
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,432
to hold in trust...

288
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,115
until the Senate is ready to rule once more.

289
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,910
Rome is to be a republic again.

290
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,228
Maximus.
Yes.

291
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,236
My decision disappoints you?

292
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,596
You wrote to me once...

293
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,709
listing the four chief virtues:

294
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,628
Wisdom...

295
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,119
justice...

296
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,719
fortitude...

297
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,798
and temperance.

298
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,872
As I read the list, I knew I had none of them.

299
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,155
But I have other virtues, Father.

300
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,594
Ambition.

301
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,638
That can be a virtue
when it drives us to excel.

302
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,878
Resourcefulness, courage.

303
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,038
Perhaps not on the battlefield,
but there are many forms of courage.

304
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,717
Devotion to my family...

305
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,119
to you.

306
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,233
But none of my virtues were on your list.

307
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,437
Even then it was as if
you didn't want me for your son.

308
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,954
Commodus...

309
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,432
you go too far.

310
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,078
I searched the faces of the gods...

311
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,998
for ways to please you, to make you proud.

312
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,751
<i>One kind word...</i>

313
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,957
one full hug...

314
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,675
where you pressed me to your chest
and held me tight...

315
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,150
would have been like the sun on my heart
for 1,000 years.

316
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,234
What is it in me you hate
so much?

317
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,435
Commodus.

318
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,516
All I've ever wanted...

319
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,833
was to live up to you, Caesar.

320
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,548
Father.
Commodus...

321
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,876
your faults as a son...

322
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,951
is my failure as a father.

323
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,679
Come.

324
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,519
Father.

325
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,394
I would butcher the whole world...

326
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,635
if you would only have loved me!

327
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,558
Maximus, the Emperor needs you.
It's urgent.

328
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,712
Lament with me, brother.

329
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,637
Our great father is dead.

330
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,918
How did he die?

331
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,600
The surgeons say
there was no pain.

332
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,711
<i>His breath gave out as he slept.</i>

333
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,399
Father.

334
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,354
Your emperor asks for your loyalty,
Maximus.

335
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,238
Take my hand.

336
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,592
<i>I only offer it once.</i>

337
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,553
Quintus.

338
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,119
Hail, Caesar.

339
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,514
I must talk to the senators.
I need their counsel.

340
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,068
- Wake Gaius and Falco.
- Gaius and Falco.

341
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,310
Sword.

342
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,473
Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.

343
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,472
Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.

344
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,194
The Emperor died
of natural causes.

345
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,910
- Why are you armed, Quintus?
- Guards!

346
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,110
Please don't fight, Maximus.

347
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,955
<i>I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.</i>

348
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,152
Ride until dawn...

349
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,799
and then execute him.

350
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,189
Quintus, look at me. Look at me!

351
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,233
Promise me
that you will look after my family.

352
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,880
Your family will meet you in the afterlife.

353
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,869
Kneel.

354
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,550
<i>Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son.</i>

355
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,598
<i>Whisper to them
that I live only to hold them again.</i>

356
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,390
At least give me a clean death.

357
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,758
A soldier's death.

358
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,277
The frost,
sometimes it makes the blade stick.

359
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,393
Praetorian!

360
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,711
<i>When was the last time
you were home?</i>

361
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,712
<i>Two years,
264 days and this morning.</i>

362
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,037
<i>Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son...</i>

363
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,350
<i>I will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.</i>

364
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,749
<i>Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.</i>

365
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,308
<i>...with a ready sword,
for all else is dust and air.</i>

366
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,278
<i>Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.</i>

367
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,555
<i>For all else is dust and air.</i>

368
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,271
Papa!

369
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,073
Don't die.

370
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,151
<i>You'll meet them again.</i>

371
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,948
<i>Not yet.</i>

372
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,795
No. They will clean it. Wait and see.

373
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,079
Don't die.

374
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,115
They'll feed you to the lions.

375
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,390
They are worth more than we are.

376
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,399
Better now?

377
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,311
Clean. You see?

378
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,479
Proximo! My old friend.

379
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,752
<i>Every day is a great day when you are here...</i>

380
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,193
but today is your most fortunate day.

381
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,309
Those giraffes you sold me,
they won't mate.

382
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,629
They just walk around eating
and not mating.

383
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,678
You sold me queer giraffes.

384
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,120
- I want my money back.
- Not a chance.

385
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,791
I do special price for you.
On what?

386
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,078
Have you seen my new stock?
Come and see them.

387
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,159
Do any of them fight?
I've got a match coming up.

388
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,754
Some are good for fighting,
others for dying.

389
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,190
You need both, I think.

390
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,429
Get up.

391
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,872
What's your trade?

392
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,594
I was a hunter.

393
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,195
No, I bought him from a salt mine
in Carthage.

394
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,279
Sit down.

395
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,194
Mark of the legion.

396
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,432
Deserter.
Maybe so, but who cares?

397
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,589
He's a Spaniard.

398
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,511
I'll take six. For 1,000.

399
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,036
One thousand?
The Numidian alone is worth 2,000.

400
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,031
These slaves are rotten.

401
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,157
It all adds to the flavour. No, wait!

402
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,318
I can negotiate.

403
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:25,273
I'll give you 2,000, and 4,000 for the beasts.

404
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,510
<i>That's 5,000 for an old friend.</i>

405
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,472
Come on! How long does it take
to get into my own house?

406
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,591
I am Proximo.

407
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,720
I shall be closer to you
for the next few days...

408
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,950
which will be the last
of your miserable lives...

409
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,874
than that bitch of a mother
that brought you screaming into this world.

410
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,677
<i>I did not pay good money for you
for your company.</i>

411
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,872
I paid it so that I could profit
from your death.

412
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,195
<i>And as your mother was there
at your beginning...</i>

413
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,674
so I shall be there at your end.

414
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,993
And when you die, and die you shall...

415
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,718
<i>your transition shall be to the sound of...</i>

416
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,599
Gladiators...

417
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,153
I salute you.

418
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,954
Red.

419
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,514
Yellow.

420
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,834
Yellow.

421
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,309
Good.

422
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,075
Red.

423
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,274
Spaniard.

424
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,510
That's enough for the moment!

425
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,353
His time will come.

426
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,275
Next.

427
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,348
Spaniard...

428
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,552
why don't you fight?

429
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,313
We all have to fight.

430
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,231
Well, I don't fight.

431
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,757
I shouldn't be here, I'm a scribe,
I write down words...

432
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,671
and speak seven languages.

433
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,909
Good.

434
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,512
Tomorrow, you can scream
in seven languages.

435
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,916
Perhaps the scribe will be the one
who wins his freedom.

436
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,834
Freedom?

437
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,638
What do I have to do?

438
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,235
You go in the arena and you kill me.

439
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,679
And him...

440
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,079
and the Numidian...

441
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,839
and the deserter.

442
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,833
And 100 more.

443
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,559
And when there's no more to fight,
you're free.

444
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,872
I can't do that.

445
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,035
No?

446
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,393
But I can.

447
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,396
Is that the sign of your gods?

448
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,391
Will that not anger them?

449
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,472
The gods favour you.

450
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,870
Red is the gods' colour.

451
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,316
You will need their help today.

452
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,598
Proximo!

453
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,790
Still leading with the German?

454
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,916
The crowd love a barbarian.

455
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,191
Besides that, he's making me rich.

456
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,748
Has that Numidian fought before?

457
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,073
No, first time.

458
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,993
And that one, labourer, soldier?

459
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,592
He's a Spaniard. He might as well
be a eunuch, for what he brings to the ring.

460
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:56,599
Five hundred sestertii, the Numidian
and Spaniard team makes it through.

461
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,235
<i>And 1,000,
that the Numidian makes it through alone.</i>

462
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,712
Are you asking me
to bet against my own man?

463
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,754
It's unethical.

464
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,757
What if I make it 2,000?

465
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,398
Some of you are thinking you won't fight...

466
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,551
some that you can't fight.

467
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,676
They all say that until they're out there.

468
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,389
Listen.

469
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,720
Kill!

470
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,679
Thrust this into another man's flesh...

471
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,600
and they will applaud and love you for that.

472
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,039
And you...

473
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,837
you may begin to love them...

474
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,959
for that.

475
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,356
Ultimately, we're all dead men.

476
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,915
Sadly, we cannot choose how...

477
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,639
but we can decide how we meet that end...

478
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,029
in order that we are remembered...

479
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,035
as men.

480
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,155
Come on!

481
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,315
On the left, draw your shields!

482
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,515
<i>On the right, draw your swords!</i>

483
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,151
Kill! Kill!

484
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,595
<i>Pair them up: Red with yellow.</i>

485
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,595
Next!

486
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,389
Move!

487
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,469
Usurper!

488
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,312
Go away!
You'll never rule us, Commodus!

489
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:58,556
He enters Rome like a conquering hero.
But what has he conquered?

490
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,035
Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.

491
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,310
I think he could do very well.

492
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,756
For Rome, or for you?

493
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,877
Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.

494
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,791
Lucius!
Mother!

495
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,353
Hail, Caesar.

496
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,993
Senators.

497
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,318
Rome greets her new emperor.

498
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,756
Your loyal subjects bid you welcome,
Highness.

499
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,632
Thank you, Falco.

500
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,639
And for the loyal subjects,
I trust they weren't too expensive.

501
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,676
Caesar.
Gracchus.

502
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,115
All Rome rejoices in your return, Caesar.

503
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,272
There are many matters
that require your attention.

504
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,639
To order, please. To order.

505
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:01,557
For your guidance, Caesar, the Senate
has prepared a series of protocols...

506
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,592
to begin addressing the many problems
in the city...

507
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,599
beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek Quarter...

508
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:12,271
to combat the plague
which is already springing up there.

509
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,358
So, if Caesar...

510
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,237
Don't you see, Gracchus?

511
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,830
That's the very problem, isn't it?

512
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,998
My father spent all his time
at study...

513
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,711
at books of learning and philosophy.

514
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:34,468
He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the Senate.

515
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,997
And all the while, the people were forgotten.

516
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,710
But the Senate is the people, sire...

517
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:44,156
chosen from among the people
to speak for the people.

518
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:48,230
I doubt many of the people
eat so well as you do, Gracchus.

519
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,429
Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.

520
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,556
I think I understand my own people.

521
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,950
Then perhaps Caesar will be so good
as to teach us...

522
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,794
out of his own extensive experience.

523
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,079
I call it love.

524
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,597
<i>I am their father.
The people are my children.</i>

525
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,394
I shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them tightly.

526
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:14,392
Have you ever embraced
someone dying of plague, sire?

527
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,188
No, but if you interrupt me again...

528
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,959
I assure you that you shall.

529
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,270
Senator, my brother is very tired.

530
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:33,233
Leave your list with me.
Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.

531
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,515
My lady, as always,
your lightest touch commands obedience.

532
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,590
Who are they to lecture me?

533
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,189
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

534
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:53,073
What uses? All they do is talk.

535
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:58,637
It should be just you and me and Rome.

536
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,871
Don't even think it.
There's always been a Senate.

537
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,952
Rome has changed.

538
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,952
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.

539
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,077
Of course, but leave the people their...

540
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,639
Illusions?

541
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,559
Traditions.

542
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:17,079
<i>My father's war against the barbarians...</i>

543
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:21,115
He said it himself: It achieved nothing.
But the people loved him.

544
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,031
The people always love victories.

545
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:26,635
Why? They didn't see the battles.

546
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,831
What do they care about Germania?

547
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,115
They care about the greatness of Rome.

548
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,031
"The greatness of Rome. "

549
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,592
Well, what is that?

550
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,312
It's an idea. Greatness.

551
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,270
Greatness is a vision.
Exactly. A vision.

552
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,037
Do you not see, Lucilla?

553
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:59,148
I will give the people a vision of Rome,
and they'll love me for it.

554
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:03,998
And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonising of a few dry old men.

555
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,157
I will give the people
the greatest vision of their lives.

556
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:10,272
White and red wine
for your drinking pleasure!

557
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,115
Games.

558
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:24,272
One hundred and fifty days of games.

559
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,312
He's cleverer than I thought.

560
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,756
Clever. The whole of Rome
would be laughing at him...

561
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,630
if they weren't so afraid of his Praetorians.

562
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,439
Fear and wonder. A powerful combination.

563
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,752
You really think the people
are going to be seduced by that?

564
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:42,798
I think he knows what Rome is.
Rome is the mob.

565
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:46,472
Conjure magic for them,
and they'll be distracted.

566
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:50,157
Take away their freedom,
and still they'll roar.

567
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:54,952
The beating heart of Rome
is not the marble of the Senate.

568
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,951
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

569
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,756
He'll bring them death...

570
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,710
and they will love him for it.

571
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,476
All you do is kill, kill, kill.

572
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,869
The crowd don't want a butcher,
they want a hero.

573
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,951
We want them to keep coming back.

574
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:37,033
So don't just hack them to pieces,
remember you are an entertainer.

575
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,794
Spaniard.

576
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,753
So entertain!

577
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:56,153
Are you not entertained?

578
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,550
Is this not why you're here?

579
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,269
Spaniard!

580
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,072
What do you want?

581
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,675
<i>Girl?</i>

582
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,749
<i>Boy?</i>

583
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,790
- You sent for me.
- Yes, I did.

584
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:38,798
You're good, Spaniard,
but you're not that good.

585
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,233
You could be magnificent.

586
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,437
I'm required to kill, so I kill. That is enough.

587
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:47,198
That's enough for the provinces,
but not for Rome.

588
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:54,189
The young emperor
has arranged a series of spectacles...

589
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:58,313
to commemorate his father,
Marcus Aurelius.

590
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,711
<i>I find that amusing...</i>

591
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,952
since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise...

592
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:07,356
the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius,
that closed us down.

593
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:14,199
So finally,
after five years of scratching a living...

594
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,390
in flea-infested villages...

595
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,438
we're finally going back to where we belong:

596
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,599
The Colosseum.

597
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,433
You should see the Colosseum, Spaniard.

598
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,711
Fifty-thousand Romans...

599
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:34,275
watching every movement of your sword...

600
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,995
willing you to make that killer blow.

601
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:42,675
The silence before you strike
and the noise afterwards.

602
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,070
It rises. It rises up...

603
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,118
like a storm.

604
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,869
As if you were the thunder god himself.

605
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:56,038
- You were a gladiator?
- Yes, I was.

606
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,191
You won your freedom?

607
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,669
A long time ago, the Emperor...

608
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,310
presented me with a rudius.

609
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,752
It's just a wooden sword.

610
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,710
<i>The symbol of your freedom.</i>

611
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,712
He touched me on the shoulder,
and I was free.

612
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,309
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

613
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:29,075
I did not say I knew him.
I said he touched me on the shoulder once.

614
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,150
You asked me what I want.

615
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,193
I, too, want to stand
in front of the Emperor...

616
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,753
as you did.

617
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:42,116
Then listen to me. Learn from me.

618
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,918
I wasn't the best because I killed quickly.

619
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,600
I was the best because the crowd loved me.

620
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:53,831
Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom.

621
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,917
I will win the crowd.

622
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,992
I will give them something
they've never seen before.

623
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:09,352
So, Spaniard,
we shall go to Rome together...

624
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,598
and have bloody adventures.

625
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,591
And the great whore
will suckle us...

626
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,989
until we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more.

627
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,433
And then...

628
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,556
when enough men have died...

629
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,995
perhaps you will have your freedom.

630
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,515
Here. Use this.

631
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:57,277
It's somewhere out there, my country.

632
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,548
<i>My home.</i>

633
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,756
My wife is preparing food.

634
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,314
My daughters carry water from the river.

635
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,556
Will I ever see them again?

636
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,239
I think, no.

637
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,875
Do you believe you'll see them again
when you die?

638
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,313
I think so.

639
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,838
But then, I will die soon.

640
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,755
They will not die for many years.

641
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,112
I'll have to wait.

642
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,316
But you would? Wait?

643
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,194
Of course.

644
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,359
You see...

645
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:35,799
my wife...

646
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:40,994
and my son are already waiting for me.

647
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:45,190
You'll meet them again. But not yet.

648
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,394
Not yet.

649
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,319
- Unless...
- Not yet.

650
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,395
Not yet.

651
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,468
There he is.

652
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,669
Out.

653
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,671
<i>Move, go, out!</i>

654
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,348
Good to see you again,
old friend.

655
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,038
Bring me fortune.

656
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,193
Have you ever seen anything
like that before?

657
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,708
<i>I didn't know men could build such things.</i>

658
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,759
Win the crowd.

659
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,150
Get inside. Move.

660
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,548
<i>Inside.</i>

661
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,354
He sleeps so well because he's loved.

662
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,191
Come, brother. It's late.

663
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,438
I will make Rome
the wonder of the ages.

664
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:57,237
That is what Gracchus and his friends
don't understand.

665
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,791
All my desires
are splitting my head to pieces.

666
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,114
Commodus, drink this tonic.

667
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:21,834
I think the time is almost right.

668
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:24,713
I could announce
the dissolution of the Senate...

669
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,871
at the celebration to honour our father.

670
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,951
Do you think I should?

671
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,516
Are the people ready?

672
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,715
I think you need your rest now.

673
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,158
Will you stay with me?

674
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,549
Still afraid of the dark, brother?

675
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,189
Still.

676
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,188
Always.

677
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,593
- Stay with me tonight.
- You know I won't.

678
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,353
Then kiss me.

679
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,313
Sleep, brother.

680
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,956
Having servants who are deaf and mute...

681
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:11,679
at least ensures I live a little longer.

682
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,630
They're arresting scholars now.

683
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:19,395
Anyone who dare speak out.
Even satirists and chroniclers.

684
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,831
And mathematicians.

685
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,070
And all to feed the arena.

686
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,074
The Senate did not approve martial law.

687
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:32,232
This reign of terror
is entirely the Praetorians.

688
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,916
I'm afraid to go out after dark.

689
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,310
You should be more afraid
of your activities during the day.

690
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:42,991
The Senate is full of his spies,
led by that whore master, Falco.

691
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:48,518
But what is in his mind?
That's what I trouble myself with.

692
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,078
He spends all his days
singularly obsessed...

693
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,879
planning the festival to honour your father.

694
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,396
He neglects even the most fundamental task
of government.

695
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,236
So just what is he planning?

696
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,158
And what pays for it?

697
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:07,279
These daily games are costing a fortune,
yet we have no new taxes.

698
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,353
The future.

699
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,631
The future pays for it.

700
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:16,474
He's started selling the grain reserves.

701
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,672
This can't be true.

702
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,879
He's selling
Rome's reserves of grain.

703
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,998
The people will be starving in two years.

704
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,953
I hope they're enjoying the games...

705
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:30,271
because soon enough
they'll be dead because of them.

706
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,830
- Rome must know this.
- And how?

707
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:35,595
He's going to dissolve the Senate.

708
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:39,550
And who will tell them before it's too late?
You, Gracchus?

709
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,313
You, Gaius.

710
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:46,234
Will you make a speech on the floor
of the Senate, denouncing my brother?

711
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,754
And then see your family in the Colosseum?

712
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:50,994
Who'd dare?

713
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:02,678
I have been living
in a prison of fear every day...

714
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,274
because my son is heir to the throne.

715
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,079
He must die.

716
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:19,875
Quintus and the Praetorians
would simply seize control for themselves.

717
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:23,635
No. Cut off the head
and the snake cannot strike.

718
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,711
Lucilla, Gaius is right.

719
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:29,759
Until we can neutralise the Praetorians,
we can achieve nothing.

720
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:32,673
So we do nothing?

721
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:35,433
No, child. We keep our counsel.

722
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:37,713
We prepare.

723
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:43,071
As long as the people support him,
we are voices without steel.

724
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,193
We are air.

725
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:50,759
But with every day that passes,
he makes enemies.

726
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,593
One day,
he'll have more enemies than friends.

727
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,833
And on that day, we will act.

728
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,197
<i>Then we will strike.</i>

729
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,752
But until then...

730
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,359
we are docile.

731
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,910
We are obedient.

732
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:10,351
And we are treacherous.

733
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:19,834
Come on!

734
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:30,196
All right, that's enough.

735
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,435
The Emperor wants battles, and I don't want
to sacrifice my best fighters.

736
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,557
The crowd wants battles,
so the Emperor gives them battles.

737
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:02,076
- You get the battle of Carthage.
- Massacre of Carthage.

738
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:07,309
Well, why don't you go down to the prison,
round up all the beggars and thieves?

739
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,515
We've done that.

740
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:12,070
If you want to give away the best gladiators
in the whole of the empire...

741
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:14,196
then I want double the rates.

742
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:17,875
You'll get your contract rates,
or you'll get your contract cancelled.

743
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,359
You don't like it?

744
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:23,228
Then you can crawl back
down that shit hole that you came from.

745
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,475
Cassius, please. You can free us.

746
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,798
Gladiator, are you the one
they call the Spaniard?

747
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,029
Yes.

748
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,870
They said you were a giant.

749
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,992
They said you could crush a man's skull
with one hand.

750
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,792
A man's? No.

751
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,308
A boy's.

752
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,670
- Do they have good horses in Spain?
- Some of the best.

753
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:20,638
This is Argento and this is Scarto.

754
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,712
They were my horses.

755
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,591
They were taken from me.

756
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,031
I like you, Spaniard. I shall cheer for you.

757
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:33,757
- They let you watch the games?
- My uncle says it makes me strong.

758
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,991
- And what does your father say?
- My father is dead.

759
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,676
Master Lucius, it is time.

760
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,194
I have to go.

761
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:44,793
Your name is Lucius?

762
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:49,400
Lucius Verus, after my father.

763
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,432
Lower!

764
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,759
Claudius!

765
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,309
Yes?
More shields!

766
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,879
All right.

767
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:53,431
When the Emperor enters,
raise your weapons, salute him...

768
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,511
and then speak together.

769
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:59,596
<i>Face the Emperor
and don't turn your back on him.</i>

770
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,393
<i>Go, and die with honour.</i>

771
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,191
Hail, mighty Caesar!

772
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:05,353
Caesar!

773
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:11,113
We who are about to die
salute you!

774
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,398
On this day...

775
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,872
we reach back to hallowed antiquity...

776
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:22,190
to bring you a re-creation
of the second fall...

777
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:24,271
of mighty Carthage!

778
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:31,998
On the barren plain of Zama...

779
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:35,518
there stood the invincible armies...

780
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:38,474
of the barbarian Hannibal.

781
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:42,197
Ferocious mercenaries
and warriors...

782
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:44,555
from all brute nations...

783
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:48,758
bent on merciless destruction...

784
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:50,874
conquest.

785
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:55,679
<i>Your emperor is pleased to give you...</i>

786
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:58,718
the barbarian horde!

787
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,597
Anyone here been in the army?

788
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:11,513
Yes. I served with you
at Vindobona.

789
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:13,879
You can help me.

790
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,395
Whatever comes out of these gates...

791
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,597
we've got a better chance of survival
if we work together.

792
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,752
<i>Do you understand?</i>

793
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,751
If we stay together, we survive.

794
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,832
The Emperor is pleased to bring you
the legionnaires...

795
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:34,356
of Scipio Africanus!

796
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,358
To the death!

797
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,468
Kill!

798
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:57,718
Stay close.

799
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:05,237
Come together!

800
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:10,399
Stay close. Staggered columns!

801
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:24,551
You don't have a chance.

802
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,354
Lock your shields. Stay as one.

803
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,279
Hold!

804
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:46,158
Hold! As one!

805
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,234
Well done.

806
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:05,275
Hold. Down low!

807
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:11,995
Yes!

808
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:24,789
Hagen!

809
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:51,350
This column to the chariot!
This column stay with me!

810
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,159
Quickly!

811
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,439
- Get out there.
- Hurry!

812
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,109
Maximus!

813
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:54,075
Single column!

814
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:38,879
We win!

815
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:46,514
My history's a little hazy, Cassius...

816
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:50,078
but shouldn't the barbarians
lose the battle of Carthage?

817
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:51,832
Yes, sire.

818
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:54,994
Forgive me, sire.

819
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:57,674
No, I rather enjoy surprises.

820
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,515
Who is he?

821
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:02,478
They call him the Spaniard, sire.

822
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:06,632
I think I'll meet him.

823
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,119
Yes, sire.

824
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:11,997
Hail to the barbarians!

825
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:29,591
Forward! Arms at ready!

826
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:44,232
Drop your weapons.

827
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,878
Gladiator, the Emperor has asked for you.

828
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:53,556
I am at the Emperor's service.

829
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,270
Rise.

830
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,391
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard.

831
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:35,040
I don't think there's ever been a gladiator
to match you.

832
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:37,793
As for this young man,
he insists you are Hector reborn.

833
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:39,359
Or was it Hercules?

834
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:44,315
<i>Why doesn't the hero reveal himself
and tell us all your real name?</i>

835
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:47,918
You do have a name.

836
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:50,471
My name is Gladiator.

837
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,637
How dare you show your back to me? Slave!

838
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:01,117
You will remove your helmet
and tell me your name.

839
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:14,869
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius...

840
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,077
commander of the armies of the north...

841
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:19,515
general of the Felix Legions...

842
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,717
loyal servant to the true emperor,
Marcus Aurelius...

843
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,070
father to a murdered son...

844
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,755
husband to a murdered wife...

845
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:32,635
and I will have my vengeance,
in this life or the next.

846
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:40,713
Arms!

847
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:56,477
Live!

848
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:44,434
Arms, at rest!

849
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:39,032
Maximus!

850
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:26,314
Father.

851
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,477
Why is he still alive?

852
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:42,073
I don't know.

853
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,118
He shouldn't be alive.

854
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,233
It vexes me.

855
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:49,592
I'm terribly vexed.

856
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:02,231
I did what I had to do.

857
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:06,839
<i>If Father had had his way,
the empire would have been torn apart.</i>

858
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:08,478
<i>You do see that.</i>

859
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:09,995
Yes.

860
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:17,711
What did you feel when you saw him?

861
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:21,272
I felt nothing.

862
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:25,594
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

863
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,710
No more than I wounded him.

864
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:35,196
They lied to me in Germania.

865
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,791
They told me he was dead.

866
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:43,188
If they lie to me, they don't respect me.

867
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:46,471
If they don't respect me,
how can they ever love me?

868
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:50,035
Then you must let the legions know...

869
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:53,112
their treachery will not go unpunished.

870
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:55,478
Poor sister.

871
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:58,035
I wouldn't want to be your enemy.

872
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:00,872
What will you do?

873
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:14,554
This way.

874
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:51,836
Rich matrons pay well
to be pleasured by the bravest champions.

875
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:54,309
I knew your brother would send assassins.

876
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:57,314
I didn't realise he would send his best.

877
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,871
Maximus, he doesn't know.

878
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:04,872
My family was burnt and crucified
while they were still alive.

879
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:07,394
- I knew nothing...
- Don't lie to me!

880
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,112
I wept for them.

881
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:18,955
As you wept for your father?

882
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:22,476
I have been living in a prison of fear
since that day.

883
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:26,635
To be unable to mourn your father
for fear of your brother.

884
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:30,557
To live in terror
every moment of every day...

885
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:33,313
because your son is heir to the throne.

886
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:36,519
I have wept.

887
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:40,519
My son was innocent.

888
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:43,276
So is mine.

889
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:48,158
Must my son die, too,
before you'll trust me?

890
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:52,393
What does it matter if I trust you or not?

891
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:56,152
The gods have spared you.
Don't you understand?

892
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:59,550
Today I saw a slave become more powerful
than the emperor of Rome.

893
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:01,358
The gods have spared me?

894
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:04,750
I am at their mercy,
with the power only to amuse a mob.

895
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:06,478
That is power.

896
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:07,875
The mob is Rome.

897
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:11,555
And while Commodus controls them,
he controls everything.

898
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,239
Listen to me.

899
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:16,558
My brother has enemies,
most of all in the Senate.

900
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:18,990
But while the people follow him...

901
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:21,958
no one would dare stand up to him
until you.

902
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:25,229
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.

903
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:28,790
There are some politicians
who have dedicated their lives to Rome.

904
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:30,552
One man above all.

905
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:34,558
If I can arrange it, will you meet him?

906
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:36,711
Do you not understand?

907
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:41,033
I may die in this cell tonight,
or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!

908
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:43,634
What possible difference can I make?

909
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,070
This man wants what you want.

910
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:48,310
Then have him kill Commodus!

911
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:52,512
I knew a man once...

912
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:54,674
a noble man.

913
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:58,358
A man of principle who loved my father...

914
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:01,276
and my father loved him.

915
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:05,230
This man served Rome well.

916
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:11,038
That man is gone.

917
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:14,196
Your brother did his work well.

918
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:15,872
Let me help you.

919
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:24,518
Yes, you can help me.

920
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:31,269
Forget you ever knew me,
never come here again.

921
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:37,439
Guard! The lady is finished with me.

922
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:06,312
What's your name?

923
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:10,553
Julian Crassus.

924
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,149
Name?

925
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:19,873
Marcus, sire.

926
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,512
My father's name.

927
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:34,116
They must have known of Maximus' escape
when they found the bodies of the four men.

928
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:37,388
They thought it was a barbarian raid.

929
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:41,437
These are good men, sire.
Loyal to the Emperor.

930
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:50,356
Load your arrows!

931
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,831
Prepare to fire!

932
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,111
Then perhaps it was you
who knew...

933
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:24,319
and never told me.

934
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,950
- I didn't know.
- You didn't know?

935
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:31,119
But a general
is always in control.

936
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:35,955
Always in command, isn't he?

937
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,839
Yes, Caesar.

938
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:54,760
Then give the command. Say it.

939
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,115
Fire.

940
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:47,148
Maximus.

941
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:50,872
You commanded legions?
You had many victories?

942
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:53,870
- Yes.
- In Germania?

943
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:57,352
In many countries.

944
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,154
General.

945
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:49,037
You have a great name.

946
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:53,398
He must kill your name before he kills you.

947
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,274
Yes, at the far end.

948
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,590
Senator Gaius.
Hello.

949
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:07,557
Senator Gracchus.

950
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:12,351
Don't often see you enjoying the pleasures
of the vulgar crowd.

951
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:15,477
I don't pretend to be a man of the people,
Senator...

952
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:17,994
but I do try to be a man for the people.

953
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:37,832
Caesar!

954
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,518
People of Rome!

955
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:48,989
On the fourth day of Antioch...

956
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:53,798
we can celebrate the 64th day of the games.

957
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:58,473
<i>And in his majestic charity...</i>

958
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:03,239
<i>the Emperor has deigned this day
to favour the people of Rome...</i>

959
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:07,076
<i>with an historical final match.</i>

960
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:12,231
Returning to the Colosseum today,
after five years in retirement...

961
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:16,910
Caesar is pleased to bring you...

962
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,629
the only undefeated champion...

963
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:22,631
in Roman history:

964
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:27,396
The legendary Tigris of Gaul!

965
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:51,197
He knows too well
how to manipulate the mob.

966
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:53,840
Marcus Aurelius had a dream
that was Rome, Proximo.

967
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:56,559
This is not it.

968
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:59,359
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.

969
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:02,674
We mortals are but shadows and dust.

970
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:05,311
<i>Shadows and dust, Maximus!</i>

971
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:09,109
Representing the training lyceum
of Antonius Proximo...

972
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:12,715
Caesar is proud to give you...

973
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:16,475
Aelius Maximus!

974
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:31,035
They embrace him
like he's one of their own.

975
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:34,874
The mob is fickle, brother.
He'll be forgotten in a month.

976
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:40,239
No, much sooner than that.

977
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,798
It's been arranged.

978
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:04,393
We who are about to die salute you.

979
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:09,437
We're with you, Maximus!

980
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:51,639
Fight on, finish it!

981
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,552
Pull, pull!

982
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:53,113
Loose! Loose!

983
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:22,031
Gut him!
Kill!

984
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:26,876
Kill!

985
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:26,876
Maximus the Merciful!

986
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:40,276
Maximus!

987
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:49,999
Forward, arms at ready!

988
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:21,789
What am I going to do
with you?

989
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:26,116
You simply won't die.

990
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:32,950
Are we so different, you and I?

991
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:36,838
You take life when you have to, as I do.

992
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:42,039
I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.

993
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:43,872
Then take it now.

994
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:58,316
<i>They tell me your son...</i>

995
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:02,834
<i>squealed like a girl
when they nailed him to the cross.</i>

996
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:06,512
And your wife...

997
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:09,511
moaned like a whore...

998
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:14,957
when they ravaged her again and again...

999
01:57:16,280 --> 01:57:17,599
and again.

1000
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:26,235
The time for honouring yourself
will soon be at an end...

1001
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:31,954
Highness.

1002
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:50,312
Maximus!

1003
01:57:58,360 --> 01:57:59,679
General!

1004
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:07,911
General!
Cicero!

1005
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:17,515
- Where are you camped?
- Ostia.

1006
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:26,553
We love you, Maximus!
Praise the victor!

1007
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:29,074
Tell the men their general lives. Find me.

1008
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:31,390
Move along!
Find me!

1009
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:57,597
Can they hear you?

1010
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:04,396
- Who?
- Your family, in the afterlife.

1011
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:09,274
Yes.
What do you say to them?

1012
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:14,159
To my boy...

1013
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:18,354
I tell him I will see him again soon...

1014
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:21,910
and to keep his heels down
when he's riding his horse.

1015
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:24,553
To my wife...

1016
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:28,996
that is not your business.

1017
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:39,193
And now they love Maximus for his mercy.

1018
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:43,950
So I can't just kill him,
or it makes me even more unmerciful.

1019
01:59:45,240 --> 01:59:49,313
The whole thing
is like some great nightmare.

1020
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:52,072
He is defying you.

1021
01:59:52,240 --> 01:59:55,516
His every victory is an act of defiance.

1022
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:59,110
The mob sees this, and so do the Senate.

1023
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:02,598
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.

1024
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,718
- Kill him.
- No.

1025
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:09,829
I will not make a martyr of him.

1026
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:19,114
When I went to the Senate today...

1027
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:23,876
I purposefully told them about using
the grain reserves to pay for the games.

1028
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:27,310
And did you note what happened?

1029
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:30,472
- Nothing.
- Exactly. Nothing.

1030
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:33,715
Not a single word of protest.

1031
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:37,236
Even the insolent Senator Gracchus
was silent as a mouse.

1032
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:38,435
Why?

1033
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:43,635
I have been told of a certain sea snake...

1034
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:47,872
which has a very unusual method
of attracting its prey.

1035
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:51,635
It will lie at the bottom of the ocean
as if wounded.

1036
02:00:52,040 --> 02:00:54,759
Then its enemies will approach...

1037
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:57,798
and yet it will lie quite still.

1038
02:00:58,120 --> 02:01:01,795
And then its enemies
will take little bites of it...

1039
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:04,997
and yet it remains still.

1040
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:09,235
So...

1041
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:12,192
we will lie still...

1042
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:16,197
and let our enemies come to us and nibble.

1043
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:19,350
<i>Have every senator followed.</i>

1044
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:39,949
Cicero, my old friend. I thought perhaps
I'd seen you for the last time.

1045
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:42,349
I thought you were dead.
Close.

1046
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:45,432
- How long have the men been in Ostia?
- All winter.

1047
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:48,837
- And how do they look?
- Fat and bored.

1048
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:52,557
Who's in command?
Some fool from Rome.

1049
02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:55,950
How soon do you think
they could be ready to fight?

1050
02:01:56,040 --> 02:01:57,758
For you, tomorrow.

1051
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:01,349
I need you to do something for me.

1052
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:07,153
Come, see, witness.

1053
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:10,152
<i>If you haven't been in the arena,
you can see the show here.</i>

1054
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:13,710
Giant Maximus
is defeating our emperor, Commodus.

1055
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:16,268
What are we to do?
He's just defying everyone...

1056
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:18,316
<i>by doing this to him, they do...</i>

1057
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:20,474
My goodness!

1058
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:25,636
He got him, he's defeated.
Give way!

1059
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:34,080
My lady? I served your father at Vindobona.

1060
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:35,513
Back.
My lady.

1061
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:37,670
<i>I served your father at Vindobona.</i>

1062
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,035
Back!

1063
02:02:39,120 --> 02:02:42,192
And I served General Maximus.
I serve him still.

1064
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:44,755
Stop.

1065
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:49,033
<i>Stand back.</i>

1066
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:53,192
The General sends word,
he will meet your politician.

1067
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:57,957
- For your loyalty, soldier.
- Thank you, my lady.

1068
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:08,759
Leave us.

1069
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:15,758
Senator Gracchus.

1070
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,228
General.

1071
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:33,874
I hope my coming here today
is evidence enough...

1072
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:36,952
that you can trust me.

1073
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:43,475
- The Senate is with you?
- The Senate?

1074
02:03:44,920 --> 02:03:47,514
Yes. I can speak for them.

1075
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:51,311
You can buy my freedom
and smuggle me out of Rome?

1076
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:53,198
To what end?

1077
02:03:54,440 --> 02:03:56,670
Get me outside the city walls.

1078
02:03:57,240 --> 02:04:00,994
Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia.
My army is encamped there.

1079
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:04,277
By nightfall of the second day,
I'll return at the head of 5,000 men.

1080
02:04:04,360 --> 02:04:06,476
But the legions
all have new commanders...

1081
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:07,913
loyal to Commodus.

1082
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:11,117
Let my men see me alive,
and you shall see where their loyalties lie.

1083
02:04:11,200 --> 02:04:12,792
This is madness.

1084
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:16,557
<i>No Roman army has entered the capital
in 100 years.</i>

1085
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:18,790
I will not trade one dictatorship for another!

1086
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:22,270
The time for half measures and talk is over,
Senator.

1087
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:25,752
And after your glorious coup, what then?

1088
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:30,435
You'll take your 5,000 warriors and leave?

1089
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:31,953
I will leave.

1090
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:36,115
The soldiers will stay for your protection
under the command of the Senate.

1091
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:37,315
So...

1092
02:04:37,640 --> 02:04:41,713
once all of Rome is yours,
you'll just give it back to the people?

1093
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:44,599
Tell me why.

1094
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:52,872
Because that was the last wish
of a dying man.

1095
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:57,597
I will kill Commodus.

1096
02:04:59,480 --> 02:05:02,392
The fate of Rome I leave to you.

1097
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:06,350
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1098
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:09,996
His daughter trusts you.

1099
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:15,478
I will trust you.

1100
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:17,796
But we have little time.

1101
02:05:18,320 --> 02:05:19,992
Give me two days...

1102
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:22,910
and I will buy your freedom.

1103
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:25,113
<i>And you...</i>

1104
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:27,918
You stay alive...

1105
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:30,952
or I'll be dead.

1106
02:05:32,720 --> 02:05:34,233
<i>Now we must go.</i>

1107
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:03,636
He'll be waiting for you.
Stand at the foot of the colossus.

1108
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:05,233
He'll find you.

1109
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:48,993
It won't work.

1110
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,070
The Emperor knows too much.

1111
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:53,950
And as for me...

1112
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:57,871
it's becoming dangerous.

1113
02:06:59,080 --> 02:07:01,230
You'll be paid on my return.

1114
02:07:03,240 --> 02:07:04,958
I give you my word.

1115
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:08,078
Your word? What if you don't return?

1116
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:12,238
Do you remember what it was
to have trust, Proximo?

1117
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:13,469
Trust?

1118
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:19,232
Who am I to trust?

1119
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:23,190
I will kill Commodus.
Why would I want that?

1120
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:25,238
He makes me rich.

1121
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:32,879
I know that you are a man of your word,
General.

1122
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:37,074
I know that you would die
for honour.

1123
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:40,197
You would die for Rome.

1124
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:44,237
You would die for the memory
of your ancestors.

1125
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:46,550
<i>But I, on the other hand...</i>

1126
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:50,838
I'm an entertainer.

1127
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:55,349
Guard!

1128
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,468
He killed the man who set you free.

1129
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:13,032
Praetorians, master.

1130
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:20,154
Halt!

1131
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:24,471
Where have you been?

1132
02:09:24,720 --> 02:09:26,392
I sent for you.

1133
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:29,352
Please, brother.

1134
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:36,677
What's troubling you?

1135
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,275
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

1136
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,558
I don't know.

1137
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:48,351
I thought you'd seen him.

1138
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:51,953
He infects everyone
like a putrid fever.

1139
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:56,432
For the health of Rome,
the Senate must be bled.

1140
02:09:56,840 --> 02:09:58,751
<i>And he will bleed, too.</i>

1141
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:00,959
Very soon.

1142
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:03,992
<i>But not tonight.</i>

1143
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:21,312
Do you remember
what our father said once?

1144
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:24,112
"It's a dream...

1145
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:27,717
"a frightful dream...

1146
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:31,479
"life is. "

1147
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:36,031
Do you think that's true?

1148
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:38,193
I don't know.

1149
02:10:41,680 --> 02:10:43,113
I think it is.

1150
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:48,354
And I have only you to share it with.

1151
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:25,953
Open your mouth.

1152
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:03,512
You know I love you.

1153
02:12:05,480 --> 02:12:06,993
And I love you.

1154
02:12:42,160 --> 02:12:43,718
Out. Get out!

1155
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:45,949
<i>Move!</i>

1156
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:52,511
Congratulations, General.

1157
02:12:52,600 --> 02:12:55,319
You've got very persuasive friends.

1158
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:03,349
My brother has had Gracchus arrested.

1159
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:06,637
We daren't wait any longer.
We must leave tonight.

1160
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:10,310
Proximo will come at midnight
and take you to the gate.

1161
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:14,475
Your servant, Cicero, will be waiting there
with horses.

1162
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:18,994
You have done all this?
Yes.

1163
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:21,398
You risk too much.

1164
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:24,231
I have much to pay for.

1165
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:28,676
You have nothing to pay for.

1166
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:31,718
You love your son. You're strong for him.

1167
02:13:34,760 --> 02:13:37,069
I am tired of being strong.

1168
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:43,079
My brother hates all the world,
and you most of all.

1169
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:46,432
Because your father chose me.
No.

1170
02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:49,875
Because my father loved you.

1171
02:13:53,600 --> 02:13:55,909
And because I loved you.

1172
02:13:58,400 --> 02:13:59,992
A long time ago.

1173
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:06,596
Was I very different then?

1174
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:14,638
You laughed more.

1175
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:20,789
I have felt alone all my life...

1176
02:14:22,040 --> 02:14:23,632
except with you.

1177
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:28,033
I must go.

1178
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:29,629
Yes.

1179
02:14:56,960 --> 02:14:58,109
There.

1180
02:15:09,200 --> 02:15:10,679
And I got you.

1181
02:15:13,560 --> 02:15:15,676
Isn't it late
to be playing legionnaire?

1182
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:17,557
I'm not a legionnaire.

1183
02:15:17,800 --> 02:15:20,314
- Not a legionnaire?
- I'm a gladiator.

1184
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:22,919
A gladiator?

1185
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:26,068
Gladiators only fight in the games.

1186
02:15:26,240 --> 02:15:29,516
Wouldn't you rather be
a great Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?

1187
02:15:29,600 --> 02:15:32,068
I'm Maximus, the saviour of Rome!

1188
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:36,552
The saviour of Rome?

1189
02:15:44,240 --> 02:15:45,912
And who said that?

1190
02:15:54,360 --> 02:15:55,873
Where's Lucius?

1191
02:15:57,080 --> 02:15:59,355
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

1192
02:16:02,120 --> 02:16:03,792
She couldn't.
She did.

1193
02:16:03,880 --> 02:16:05,950
She took it from a basket...

1194
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:10,829
and pressed it to her breast,
right here above her heart.

1195
02:16:12,560 --> 02:16:15,677
It bit her in the breast?
Yes.

1196
02:16:16,360 --> 02:16:20,148
You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies...

1197
02:16:20,520 --> 02:16:24,433
behave very strangely
and do very odd things in the name of love.

1198
02:16:24,520 --> 02:16:27,114
I think it's silly.
So do I.

1199
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:32,676
Sister, join us.

1200
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:34,952
I've been reading
to dear Lucius.

1201
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:36,996
I've been reading, too.
Yes.

1202
02:16:37,080 --> 02:16:41,153
He's a very clever little boy.
He'll make a grand emperor one day.

1203
02:16:42,720 --> 02:16:46,349
We've been reading about the great
Mark Antony and his adventures in Egypt.

1204
02:16:46,440 --> 02:16:48,874
And the queen killed herself with a snake.

1205
02:16:48,960 --> 02:16:52,430
And just wait until you hear
what happened to our ancestors.

1206
02:16:52,520 --> 02:16:56,832
If you're very good, tomorrow night
I'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius.

1207
02:16:58,040 --> 02:16:59,712
He was betrayed...

1208
02:17:00,600 --> 02:17:02,636
by those closest to him.

1209
02:17:04,440 --> 02:17:06,112
By his own blood.

1210
02:17:07,400 --> 02:17:09,789
<i>They whispered in dark corners...</i>

1211
02:17:09,880 --> 02:17:12,075
<i>and went out late at night...</i>

1212
02:17:12,320 --> 02:17:15,517
and conspired, and conspired.

1213
02:17:17,960 --> 02:17:21,714
But the Emperor Claudius knew
that they were up to something.

1214
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:24,268
<i>He knew they were busy little bees.</i>

1215
02:17:26,120 --> 02:17:29,078
And one night he sat down
with one of them...

1216
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:31,711
and he looked at her...

1217
02:17:32,600 --> 02:17:34,079
and he said:

1218
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:37,554
"Tell me what you've been doing...

1219
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:39,872
"busy little bee.

1220
02:17:42,080 --> 02:17:45,072
"Or I shall strike down those dearest to you.

1221
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:49,118
<i>"You shall watch as I bathe in their blood. "</i>

1222
02:17:52,560 --> 02:17:54,869
And the Emperor was heartbroken.

1223
02:17:56,920 --> 02:18:01,596
The little bee had wounded him more deeply
than anyone else could ever have done.

1224
02:18:03,720 --> 02:18:06,473
<i>What do you think happened then, Lucius?</i>

1225
02:18:07,080 --> 02:18:08,832
I don't know, Uncle.

1226
02:18:15,080 --> 02:18:17,548
The little bee told him everything.

1227
02:19:13,240 --> 02:19:16,198
Open,
in the name of the Emperor!

1228
02:19:16,760 --> 02:19:17,988
<i>Proximo!</i>

1229
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:21,912
<i>Open the gates,
in the name of the Emperor!</i>

1230
02:19:26,040 --> 02:19:27,439
Open the gates!

1231
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:35,235
<i>Open the gates, Proximo.</i>

1232
02:19:35,680 --> 02:19:37,830
<i>Do you want to die, old man?</i>

1233
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:40,069
Here.

1234
02:19:40,680 --> 02:19:42,671
Everything is prepared.

1235
02:19:42,760 --> 02:19:45,149
It seems you have won your freedom.

1236
02:19:45,240 --> 02:19:48,676
Proximo, are you in danger
of becoming a good man?

1237
02:19:53,560 --> 02:19:57,235
- Juba.
- All enemies of the emperor die!

1238
02:19:57,760 --> 02:19:59,830
<i>Open the gates!</i>

1239
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:06,997
Pull!

1240
02:20:09,080 --> 02:20:11,799
Move!
Form a column on the left!

1241
02:20:15,440 --> 02:20:18,352
I only need moments,
so do not be careless with your lives.

1242
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:21,079
If you don't want any part of this,
go back to your cells.

1243
02:20:21,160 --> 02:20:23,230
We'll wait here for you, Maximus.

1244
02:20:23,320 --> 02:20:26,073
Strength and honour.
Go.

1245
02:20:26,920 --> 02:20:28,672
Strength and honour.

1246
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:33,919
Aim. Arch your bows!

1247
02:21:38,280 --> 02:21:39,508
Shadows and dust.

1248
02:22:19,720 --> 02:22:20,789
Maximus!

1249
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:27,513
I'm sorry.

1250
02:22:52,840 --> 02:22:54,159
It's done.

1251
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:02,831
And what of my nephew?

1252
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:05,591
And what of his mother?

1253
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:10,028
Should they share her lover's fate?

1254
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:13,636
Or should I be merciful?

1255
02:23:16,240 --> 02:23:18,071
Commodus the Merciful.

1256
02:23:24,280 --> 02:23:26,475
Lucius will stay with me now.

1257
02:23:27,560 --> 02:23:29,312
And if his mother...

1258
02:23:30,680 --> 02:23:32,671
so much as looks at me...

1259
02:23:33,800 --> 02:23:36,189
in a manner that displeases me...

1260
02:23:38,080 --> 02:23:39,479
he will die.

1261
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:45,911
If she decides to be noble...

1262
02:23:47,600 --> 02:23:49,591
and takes her own life...

1263
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:52,519
he will die.

1264
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:57,752
And as for you...

1265
02:24:00,360 --> 02:24:02,078
you will love me...

1266
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:04,512
as I have loved you.

1267
02:24:06,040 --> 02:24:09,555
You will provide me
with an heir of pure blood...

1268
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:12,238
so that Commodus...

1269
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:15,633
and his progeny will rule for 1,000 years.

1270
02:24:20,080 --> 02:24:21,752
Am I not merciful?

1271
02:24:42,720 --> 02:24:45,234
Am I not merciful!

1272
02:24:56,960 --> 02:25:00,032
Maximus!

1273
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:29,759
I'm a soldier. I obey.

1274
02:25:32,360 --> 02:25:36,478
Nothing happens to anyone
that he is not fitted by nature to bear.

1275
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:09,308
Maximus!

1276
02:26:15,440 --> 02:26:17,271
They call for you.

1277
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:22,197
The general
who became a slave.

1278
02:26:23,400 --> 02:26:25,709
The slave who became a gladiator.

1279
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,719
The gladiator who defied an emperor.

1280
02:26:31,560 --> 02:26:33,198
A striking story.

1281
02:26:34,320 --> 02:26:37,471
Now the people want to know
how the story ends.

1282
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:41,830
Only a famous death will do.

1283
02:26:43,680 --> 02:26:46,114
And what could be more glorious...

1284
02:26:46,480 --> 02:26:50,075
than to challenge the Emperor himself
in the great arena?

1285
02:26:52,320 --> 02:26:55,232
You would fight me?
Why not?

1286
02:26:56,400 --> 02:26:58,356
Do you think I'm afraid?

1287
02:26:59,120 --> 02:27:01,998
I think you have been afraid all your life.

1288
02:27:02,120 --> 02:27:05,669
Unlike Maximus the Invincible,
who knows no fear?

1289
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:14,112
I knew a man who once said,
"Death smiles at us all.

1290
02:27:15,320 --> 02:27:17,675
"All a man can do is smile back. "

1291
02:27:19,400 --> 02:27:20,753
I wonder...

1292
02:27:21,360 --> 02:27:24,033
did your friend smile at his own death?

1293
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:25,879
You must know.

1294
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:30,358
He was your father.

1295
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:36,310
You loved my father, I know...

1296
02:27:37,760 --> 02:27:39,193
but so did I.

1297
02:27:40,760 --> 02:27:43,228
That makes us brothers, doesn't it?

1298
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:47,796
Smile for me now, brother.

1299
02:27:53,080 --> 02:27:55,753
Strap on his armour. Conceal the wound.

1300
02:28:47,960 --> 02:28:49,837
Ring formation!

1301
02:30:37,080 --> 02:30:38,593
Quintus, sword.

1302
02:30:40,040 --> 02:30:41,758
Give me your sword.

1303
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:46,951
Sword! Give me a sword!

1304
02:30:48,400 --> 02:30:50,152
Sheathe your swords.

1305
02:33:01,720 --> 02:33:03,073
Maximus.

1306
02:33:09,920 --> 02:33:11,194
Quintus.

1307
02:33:12,800 --> 02:33:14,199
Free my men.

1308
02:33:15,600 --> 02:33:18,194
Senator Gracchus
is to be reinstated.

1309
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:21,351
There was a dream that was Rome.

1310
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:23,797
<i>It shall be realised.</i>

1311
02:33:24,520 --> 02:33:26,988
These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius.

1312
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:29,831
Free the prisoners. Go!

1313
02:33:53,520 --> 02:33:54,748
Maximus.

1314
02:33:56,600 --> 02:33:58,113
Lucius is safe.

1315
02:34:13,760 --> 02:34:15,113
Go to them.

1316
02:35:02,880 --> 02:35:04,279
You're home.

1317
02:35:29,800 --> 02:35:32,268
Is Rome worth one good man's life?

1318
02:35:35,960 --> 02:35:37,712
We believed it once.

1319
02:35:40,760 --> 02:35:42,751
Make us believe it again.

1320
02:35:46,160 --> 02:35:48,151
He was a soldier of Rome.

1321
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:53,193
Honour him.

1322
02:35:53,640 --> 02:35:55,710
Who will help me carry him?

1323
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:40,232
Now we are free.

1324
02:36:46,360 --> 02:36:48,157
I will see you again.

1325
02:36:50,920 --> 02:36:52,319
But not yet.

1326
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:54,554
Not yet.
