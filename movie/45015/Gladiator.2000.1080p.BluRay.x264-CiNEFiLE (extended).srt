1
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,630
罗马帝国在全盛时期的版图

2
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,000
由非洲沙漠延伸至

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,710
英格兰北部边境

4
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,910
罗马皇帝更掌控了全世界

5
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,110
三分之一以上人口的生杀大权

6
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,010
在西元180年的冬天 马可・奥勒留皇帝(著名的哲学皇帝)

7
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,390
12年征战讨伐日耳曼野蛮部落的行动

8
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,860
即将宣告结束

9
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,190
只要扫平最后一处据点 罗马大军便可获得胜利

10
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,690
而帝国从此可以永享太平

11
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,390
日耳曼尼亚(今德国境内)

12
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,070
长官
Sir.

13
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,420
将军
General.

14
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,430
长官
Sir.

15
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,110
士兵们又累又饿
Lean and hungry.

16
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,980
- 还没有动静吗 - 完全没有
- Still nothing? - Not a sign.

17
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,960
- 他去了多久 - 将近两小时了
- How long has he been gone? - Nearly two hours.

18
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,690
他们会开战吗 长官
Will they fight, sir?

19
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,280
我们很快就会知道了
We shall know soon enough.

20
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,910
士兵 把投石车往前挪点
Soldier, I ordered you to move those catapults forward.

21
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,300
- 射程不够远 - 射程没问题
- They're out of range. - Range is good.

22
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,430
- 可能会误伤轻骑兵的 - 不用担心 同意吧
- The danger to the cavalry... - Is acceptable. Agreed?

23
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,190
他们拒绝投降
They say no.

24
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,680
他们应该认命了 他们已被征服了
People should know when they're conquered.

25
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,940
你会吗 昆塔斯
Would you, Quintus?

26
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,150
我会吗
Would I?

27
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,590
- 勇气与荣耀 - 勇气与荣耀
- Strength and honor. - Strength and honor.

28
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,390
收到我的信号后就发动攻击
At my signal, unleash hell.

29
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,620
投石车准备
Load the catapults.

30
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,460
步兵组成进攻队形
Infantry form up for advance.

31
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,320

33
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,050
弟兄们

34
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,990
- 马西墨斯 - 马西墨斯
- Maximus! - Maximus!

35
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,520
三星期后 我将在田里收割庄稼
Three weeks from now, I will be harvesting my crops.

36
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,080
想像下你要去的地方 愿望就要实现了
Imagine where you will be, and it will be so.

37
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,110
保持队形 跟我冲啊
Hold the line! Stay with me!

38
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,860
如果你发现自己落单了
If you find yourself alone,

39
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,970
迎着阳光 独自驰骋在草原上时
riding in green fields with the sun on your face,

40
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,340
不用迷惑
do not be troubled.

41
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,810
那是因为你已在天堂了 你已经阵亡了
For you are in Elysium, and you're already dead!

42
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,640
兄弟们
Brothers,

43
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,860
我们生平的事迹
what we do in life

44
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,570
将永远流传
echoes in eternity.

45
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,370
拉
Pull!

46
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,010
投石车准备就绪 长官
Cohorts ready, sir!

47
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,020
弓箭手 点火
Archers, ignite!

48
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,900
- 点火 - 点火
- Ignite! - Ignite!

49
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,450
弓箭手 拉满弓
Archers, draw!

50
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,290
射
Loose!

51
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,410
好了 大家开始进攻
All right, men, ready!

52
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,200
保持队形
Hold the line!

53
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,570
射
Loose!

54
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,130
填装弹药
Reload!

55
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,170
保持队形
Hold the line!

56
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,600
- 拉弓 - 射
- Draw! - Loose!

57
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:18,130
跟着我冲
Stay with me!

58
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,640
罗马必胜
Roma victor!

59
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,710
普利托里亚十四

60
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,680
你认为他真的快死了吗
Do you think he's really dying?

61
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,100
十年来 他一直过都是这样子
He's been dying for 10 years.

62
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,580
如果他不是快不行了 就不会派人来召见我们了
If he werert really dying, he wouldn't have sent for us.

63
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,460
也许他只是想念我们呢
Maybe he just misses us.

64
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,130
那元老会的议员们呢 没事他不会传唤他们的 除非
And the senators? He wouldn't have summoned them if...

65
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,510
安静点 康莫德斯
Peace, Commodus.

66
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,880
在路上两星期里
After two weeks on the road,

67
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,650
你老是疑神疑鬼的 烦死我了
your incessant scheming is hurting my head.

68
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,500
他已作了决定 他将会宣布
He's made his decision. He's going to announce it.

69
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,040
传位给我
He will name me.

70
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,550
我将要做的第一件事
The first thing I shall do when...

71
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,620
就是举行大型的竞技比赛来荣耀他
Is honor him with games won'thy of His Majesty.

72
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,560
现在 我最想做的第一件事 就是淋个热水浴
For now, the first thing I shall do is have a hot bath.

73
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,060
殿下
Your Highness?

74
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,860
看来我们就快到了
We seem to be almost there, sir.

75
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,230
- 殿下 - 皇帝在哪里
- Sire. - Where's the Emperor?

76
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,980
殿下 他在前线 已经去了19天了
He's at the front, sire. They've been gone for 19 days.

77
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,280
伤员还在不断的运回来
The wounded are still coming in.

78
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,990
备马
My horse.

79
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,760
殿下
My lord.

80
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,380
给我一个吻
Kiss?

81
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,840
你再次证明了你的勇猛 马西墨斯
You have proved your valor yet again, Maximus.

82
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,720
希望这是最后一次了
Let us hope, for the last time.

83
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,370
我们已经没有敌人了 陛下
There's no one left to fight, sire.

84
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,130
永远不能掉以轻心 敌人无处不在
There is always someone left to fight.

85
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:29,150
我该怎样奖赏罗马最伟大的将军呢
How can I reward Rome's greatest general?

86
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,150
恩准我回家
Let me go home.

87
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,950
家
Home.

88
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,290
凯撒 他们向你致敬
They honor you, Caesar.

89
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,180
是向你致敬 马西墨斯 他们尊敬你
It's for you, Maximus. They honor you.

90
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,870
我错过了这次的战役了吗
Have I missed it? Have I missed the battle?

91
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,320
你错过了整场战争
You have missed the war.

92
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,630
父亲 恭喜你
Father, congratulations.

93
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,490
我会献上100头公牛来庆祝你的胜利
I shall sacrifice 100 bulls to honor your triumph.

94
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,240
那到不必
Save the bulls.

95
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,800
向马西墨斯致敬吧 是他打赢了这场战役
Honor Maximus. He won the battle.

96
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,550
- 将军 - 陛下
- General. - Highness.

97
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,130
罗马向你致敬 而我以兄弟的身份拥抱你
Rome salutes you, and I embrace you as a brother.

98
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,000
很久没见了 老朋友
It has been too long, my old friend.

99
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,550
陛下
Highness.

100
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,230
来 父亲 让我来扶你
Here, Father. Take my arm.

101
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,030
我想我是时候离开了
I think it is time for me to leave.

102
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:18,510
这就是罗马的荣耀
So much for the glory of Rome.

103
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,350
宏伟的战役
Magnificent battle.

104
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,980
将军 还活着
General. Still alive?

105
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,360
还活着
Still alive.

106
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,070
天上的诸神也有幽默感的
The gods must have a sense of humor.

107
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,820
- 他们一定特别照顾你 - 维勒瑞斯
- The gods must love you. - Valerius.

108
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,780
将军 你是要回军营呢 还是回罗马
Back to barracks, General? Or to Rome?

109
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,970
回家 我妻子孩子还有庄稼都在等着我
Home. My wife, my son, the harvest.

110
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,910
农夫马西墨斯 我还是无法想像你当农夫的样子
Maximus the farmer. I still have difficulty imagining that.

111
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,620
你知道的 泥垢要比血迹容易洗掉 昆塔斯
You know, dirt cleans off a lot easier than blood, Quintus.

112
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,790
- 他在这里 - 陛下
- Here he is. - Highness.

113
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,050
议员盖尔斯 议员佛克
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

114
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,010
当心盖尔斯 他会替你洗脑
Beware of Gaius. He'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear,

115
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,680
接着某天你醒来 就只会高喊"共和万岁 共和万岁"
and you'll wake up one day and all you'll say is, "Republic, republic, republic."

116
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,430
有何不可 毕竟罗马创建时是共和制的
Well, why not? Rome was founded as a republic.

117
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,390
在共和制下 共和国是由元老会来执政的
Yes, and in a republic the senate has the power.

118
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,690
当然 议员盖尔斯绝不是因此才从政的
But Senator Gaius isn't influenced by that, of course.

119
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,770
你支持谁呢 将军 皇帝还是元老院
Where do you stand, General? Emperor or Senate?

120
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,110
军人的职责就是
A soldier has the advantage

121
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,610
保家卫国上阵杀敌 议员
of being able to look his enemy in the eye, Senator.

122
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,700
有军队支持 你要从政易如反掌
Well, with an army behind you, you could be extremely political.

123
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,930
我警告了你 二位 失陪一下
I warned you. Now I shall save you. Senators.

124
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,190
马西墨斯
Maximus.

125
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,770
我将会需要你的帮助
I'm going to need good men like you.

126
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,430
有什么我可以效劳的 殿下
How may I be of service, Highness?

127
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,560
只有你才知道该如何指挥军队
You're a man who knows what it is to command.

128
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,980
在你的领导下 无人不服 战无不胜
You give your orders, the orders are obeyed, and the battle is won.

129
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,870
但那些议员们只会争吵算计阿谀奉承还有欺骗
But these senators scheme, squabble and flatter and deceive.

130
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,400
马西墨斯 我们必须从政客们的手中拯救罗马
Maximus, we must save Rome from the politicians, my friend.

131
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,630
到时候我能期待你的帮助吗
Can I count on you when the time comes?

132
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,370
殿下 只要你父亲恩准我离开 我打算立刻回家去
Highness, when your father releases me, I intend to return home.

133
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,640
回家 你是应该回家看看
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.

134
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,980
可别耽于安逸 也许我很快就会需要你的
Don't get too comfortable. I may call on you before long.

135
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,650
露西拉来了 你知道吗
Lucilla's here. Did you know?

136
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,070
她还没有忘记你
She's not forgotten you.

137
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,700
而现在 你是个英雄了
And now, you're the great man.

138
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,510
如果你生为男人的话
If only you had been born a man,

139
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,840
你会成为一位伟大的凯撒
what a Caesar you would have made.

140
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,970
父亲
Father.

141
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,960
你会很强壮
You would have been strong.

142
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,320
我想知道 你会很公正吗
I wonder, would you have been just?

143
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,740
我不会辜负你对我的教导和期望
I would have been what you taught me to be.

144
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,260
旅途怎样
How was yourjourney?

145
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:58,120
漫长 不舒服 为什么要我来
Long. Uncomfortable. Why have I come?

146
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,290
我需要你的帮忙 和你弟弟有关
I need your help. With your brother.

147
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,400
当然
Of course.

148
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,630
他爱你 他一向都很爱你
He loves you. He always has.

149
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,880
另外
And

150
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,920
他现在比往常更需要你
he will need you now, more than ever.

151
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,890
不谈政治了
Enough of politics.

152
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,100
我们何不假装你是一个可爱的女儿
Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter,

153
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,060
而我则是个好父亲
and I am a good father.

154
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,360
令人愉快的假设 不是吗
This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?

155
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,840
早上好
Good morning to you.

156
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,520
再给我三匹马
I need three more horses.

157
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:16,570
一 二 三
One! Two! Three!

158
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,560
四
Four!

159
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,910
一 二
One! Two!

160
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,050
你召见我吗 凯撒
You sent for me, Caesar?

161
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,680
- 凯撒 - 再告诉我一遍 马西墨斯
- Caesar? - Tell me again, Maximus.

162
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,480
我们为什么会在这里
Why are we here?

163
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,320
为了罗马的荣耀 陛下
For the glory of the empire, sire.

164
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,820
没错
Yes.

165
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,820
对 我记起来了
Yes, I remember.

166
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,160
看到那地图了吗 马西墨斯
Do you see that map, Maximus?

167
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,500
那就是我所创建的世界
That is the world which I created.

168
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,000
25年来
For 25 years,

169
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,420
我四处征战 半生戎马 才有今天的局面
I have conquered, spilt blood, expanded the empire.

170
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,580
自从我成为凯撒后 据我所知只有四年没有战争
Since I became Caesar, I've known four years without war.

171
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,180
在20年里 只有四年的和平
Four years of peace in 20.

172
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,970
这一切究竟是为了什么
And for what?

173
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,190
我只给大家带来了战争 仅此而已
I brought the sword. Nothing more.

174
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,760
凯撒 你的一生
Caesar, your life...

175
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,450
求你 不要那么叫我了
Please. Please don't call me that.

176
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,990
过来
Come. Please.

177
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,160
过来坐下
Come sit.

178
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,700
让我们好好谈谈
Let us talk together now,

179
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,710
纯粹是男人之间的闲聊
very simply, as men.

180
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,210
说吧 马西墨斯
Well, Maximus,

181
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,760
说吧
talk.

182
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,700
我有5000个人在外面的泥浆中挨冻
Five thousand of my men are out there in the freezing mud.

183
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,580
其中3000人浑身是伤
Three thousand of them are bloodied and cleaved.

184
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,120
另外有2000人再也无法离开这里 他们都已经死了
Two thousand will never leave this place.

185
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,420
我绝不相信他们的牺牲毫无意义
I will not believe that they fought and died for nothing.

186
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,130
那你相信什么 马西墨斯
And what would you believe?

187
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:16,050
他们为了你和罗马而战
They fought for you and for Rome.

188
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,940
罗马是什么 马西墨斯
And what is Rome, Maximus?

189
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,510
我到过世界上别的许多地方
I've seen much of the rest of the world.

190
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:26,600
那里既冷酷又阴暗 罗马象征着光明
It is brutal and cruel and dark. Rome is the light.

191
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,600
但你从没去过那里
Yet you have never been there.

192
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,150
你没看见罗马已经变成什么样了
You have not seen what it has become.

193
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,290
我快要死了 马西墨斯
I am dying, Maximus.

194
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,190
当一个快死的时候
When a man sees his end,

195
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,340
他会想知道自己的一生是否有价值
he wants to know there was some purpose to his life.

196
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,620
人们将来会怎么评价我呢
How will the world speak my name in years to come?

197
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,000
会推崇我是个哲学家
Will I be known as the philosopher?

198
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,600
一名勇士
The warrior?

199
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,310
还是位暴君
The tyrant?

200
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:55,440
或是让罗马回归自我的皇帝
Or will I be the Emperor who gave Rome back her true self?

201
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,840
恢复共和制的罗马是个梦想
There was once a dream that was Rome.

202
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,680
你只能悄悄地说
You could only whisper it.

203
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,850
再大声一点的话 它将会消失
Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish,

204
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,780
它是如此的脆弱
it was so fragile.

205
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,790
我担心在残酷的现实环境中 他根本无法存活下去
And I fear that it will not survive the winter.

206
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,790
马西墨斯
Maximus,

207
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:17,630
让我们说点悄悄话
let us whisper now,

208
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,590
只有我和你
together, you and I.

209
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,800
你有个儿子
You have a son.

210
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,180
说说你讲你的家庭
Tell me about your home.

211
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:34,310
我家在提基洛附近的山丘上
My house is in the hills above Trujillo.

212
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,440
一个非常简单的地方
A very simple place.

213
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,760
在阳光下的暖和的红砖屋
Pink stones that warm in the sun.

214
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,360
白天 菜园里飘着药草的香味
A kitchen garden that smells of herbs in the day,

215
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,030
到了晚上则是茉莉花的味道
jasmine in the evening.

216
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,290
门外有一棵高大的白杨树
Through the gate is a giant poplar.

217
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,400
无花果树 苹果树和梨树
Figs, apples, pears.

218
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,330
土壤是黑色的 比我妻子的头发还黑
The soil, Marcus, black. Black like my wife's hair.

219
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,530
南坡上种葡萄 北坡种着橄榄
Grapes on the south slopes, olives on the north.

220
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,860
野生的小马在我家附近玩耍 他们常逗我的儿子玩
Wild ponies play near my house. They tease my son.

221
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,580
他也想变成一匹小马
He wants to be one of them.

222
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,450
你上一次回家是什么时候
When was the last time you were home?

223
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,680
2年又264天 还要算上今天早上
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

224
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:15,600
我羡慕你 马西墨斯 你有个幸福的家庭
I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home.

225
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,020
值得你为它如此奋斗
Worth fighting for

226
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,980
在你回家之前
There is one more duty

227
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,280
我希望你帮我做最后一件事
that I ask of you before you go home.

228
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,310
你要我做什么 凯撒
What would you have me do, Caesar?

229
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:35,040
我要你在我死后成为罗马的保护者
I want you to become the protector of Rome after I die.

230
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,210
我会把政权交给你
I will empower you to one end alone,

231
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:43,210
将权力还给罗马的人民
to give power back to the people of Rome,

232
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,630
结束危害罗马的贪污腐败
and end the corruption that has crippled it.

233
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:56,560
你愿意接受这光荣的使命吗
Will you accept this great honor that I have offered you?

234
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,850
我打心眼里 不愿意
With all my heart, no.

235
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,150
马西墨斯
Maximus,

236
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,640
这就是我一定要授权给你的原因
that is why it must be you.

237
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,810
但这应该是行政官或者议员的职责
But surely a prefect, a senator,

238
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,600
一个了解罗马 熟悉政治的人
somebody who knows the city, who understands her politics.

239
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,660
但你还没被罗马的政治腐蚀
But you have not been corrupted by her politics.

240
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:24,300
- 康莫德斯呢 - 康莫德斯不是正人君子
- And Commodus? - Commodus is not a moral man.

241
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,870
你比谁都要清楚这一点
You have known that since you were young.

242
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,910
康莫德斯不能统治罗马
Commodus cannot rule.

243
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,390
绝对不可以
He must not rule.

244
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,720
我要是有你这样的儿子就好了
You are the son that I should have had.

245
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:42,270
康莫德斯会接受我的决定的
Commodus will accept my decision.

246
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:49,320
他知道军队只对你效忠
He knows that you command the loyalty of the army.

247
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,770
我需要时间考虑
I need some time, sire.

248
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,310
好吧
Yes.

249
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,960
我希望在日落之前你能答应我的请求
By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.

250
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,210
现在 像儿子般拥抱我吧
Now embrace me as my son.

251
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:10,340
顺便再帮我拿条毯子来
And bring an old man another blanket.

252
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:29,070
- 我父亲现在只宠爱你 - 夫人
- My father favors you now. - My lady.

253
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,660
- 以前不是这样 - 很多东西都改变了
- It was not always so. - Many things change.

254
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:36,160
话是没错 但不是所有的事情
Many things. Not everything.

255
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,700
马西墨斯 站住
Maximus, stop.

256
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,170
让我看看你的脸
Let me see your face.

257
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,420
- 你看起来很沮丧 - 我失去了很多部下
- You seem upset. - I lost many men.

258
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,680
我父亲找你有什么事
What did my father want with you?

259
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,720
在我回家前祝我一路顺风
To wish me well before I leave for home.

260
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,850
你在撒谎
You're lying.

261
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,500
我总能看穿你在撒谎 因为你不精于此道
I could always tell when you were lying, because you were never any good at it.

262
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,090
我一直都不习惯你的安慰
I never acquired your comfort with it.

263
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,210
没错
True.

264
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,400
反正你也不需要
But then you never had to.

265
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,610
对军人来说 生活要简单的多
Life is more simple for a soldier.

266
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,620
或许你觉得我很无情
Or do you think me heartless?

267
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,370
我觉得你具备生存的天分
I think you have a talent for survival.

268
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,920
马西墨斯 停下
Maximus, stop.

269
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,990
再次见到我真的这么可怕吗
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?

270
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,590
不 我只是厌倦了战争
No. I'm tired from battle.

271
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,010
看到我父亲是那么脆弱 你很心痛
It hurts you to see my father so fragile.

272
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,560
康莫德斯期望父亲会很快宣布他是断任者
Commodus expects that my father will announce his succession within days.

273
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:51,110
你会像追随我父亲那样对我弟弟效忠吗
Will you serve my brother as you served his father?

274
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,450
我会永远对罗马效忠
I will always serve Rome.

275
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,140
你知道吗
Do you know,

276
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,740
我还是不忘替你祈祷
I still remember you in my prayers.

277
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,710
是的 我有祈祷
Oh, yes. I pray.

278
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,590
听到你丈夫去世的消息我很难过 我替他追悼
I was sad to hear of your husband's death. I mourned him.

他快八岁了

祖先们 我祈求你们指引我

290
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,870
西斯洛
Cicero.

291
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,590
主人
Sir.

292
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,590
我不觉得履行义务很困难吗
Do you ever find it hard to do your duty?

293
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,890
有时我做我想做事

294

其余的时间我做我应该做的事

295
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:57,070
也许我们还是不能回家去
We may not be able to go home, after all.

296
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,000
你准备好对罗马履行你的职责了吗

297

是的 父亲

298
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,750
你不会成为皇帝

299
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,410
哪位年长的智者会取代我的地位
Which wiser, older man is to take my place?

300
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,050
我会将政权移交给马西墨斯
My powers will pass to Maximus,

301
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,000
直到确认
to hold in trust,

302
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,810
元老院准备好再次治理罗马
until the Senate is ready to rule once more.

303
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,820
罗马会再度成为共和国
Rome is to be a republic again.

304
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,360
- 马西墨斯 - 对
- Maximus. - Yes.

305
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,700
我的决定使你失望了吗
My decision disappoints you?

306
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,290
你曾写信给我
You wrote to me once,

307
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,590
上面列举了四种主要的美德

308

坚毅

311
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,010
和自律

312
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,310
读完信后我就明白自己一种都不具备
As I read the list, I knew I had none of them.

313
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,730
但我有其他的美德 父亲
But I have other virtues, Father.

314
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,280
野心
Ambition.

315
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:05,490
当它驱使我们做的更优秀的时候 这也是一种美德
That can be a virtue when it drives us to excel.

316
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,910
智谋 勇气

317
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:15,290
也许和行军打仗无关 但 勇气也有很多种的
Perhaps not on the battlefield, but there are many forms of courage.

318
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,170
对家庭的全心全意的奉献
Devotion to my family,

319
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,670
还有对你的爱

320
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,970
但你完全不欣赏我所有的优点
But none of my virtues were on your list.

321
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,540
就像你根本不希望有我这样的儿子
Even then it was as if you didn't want me for your son.

322
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,020
康莫德斯
Commodus,

323
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,560
你想的太多了
you go too far.

324
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,360
我向天上的诸神祈求
I searched the faces of the gods

325
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:45,490
让我能够讨你欢心 让你能够以我为荣
for ways to please you, to make you proud.

326
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,360
只要一句赞美
One kind word,

327
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,700
或是一个拥抱
one full hug,

328
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:54,540
把我紧紧的抱在你怀里
where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight,

329
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:59,210
都会像慈蔼的阳光温暖我的心
would have been like the sun on my heart for 1, 000 years.

330
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,450
为什么你如此讨厌我
What is it in me you hate so much?

331
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,760
康莫德斯
Commodus.

332
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,930
我不敢有任何奢求
All I've ever wanted

333
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,470
只求能符合你的期望 凯撒

334
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,390
- 父亲 - 康莫德斯
- Father. - Commodus,

335

336
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,240

337
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,420
过来

338
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,420
父亲
Father.

339
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:03,060
为了让你能爱我
I would butcher the whole world,

340
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,440
即使血洗天下我也在所不惜
if you would only have loved me!

341
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,190
马西墨斯 皇帝有急事要找你
Maximus, the Emperor needs you. It's urgent.

342

和我一起哀悼 兄弟

343

我们伟大的父亲去世了
Our great father is dead.

344
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,850
他怎样死的
How did he die?

345
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,800
医生们说是呼吸衰竭
The surgeons say there was no pain.

346
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,030
他在睡梦中安详的走了
His breath gave out as he slept.

347
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,040
父亲
Father.

348
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,380
新皇帝需要你的忠诚 马西墨斯
Your emperor asks for your loyalty, Maximus.

349
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,340
宣誓效忠于我
Take my hand.

350

356
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:17,070
马西墨斯 请三思而行 你的举动太过轻率
Maximus, please be careful. That was not prudent.

357
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,970
轻率 皇帝是被人谋杀的
Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.

358
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,930
皇帝是自然死亡

364
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,910
昆塔斯 看着我 看着我

这群奴隶根本不中用
These slaves are rotten.

416
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:25,130
人不可貌相 不 不 不 不 等等
It all adds to the flavor. No, no, no, wait! Wait!

417
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:27,340
等一下 价钱好商量
I can negotiate.

418
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:32,620
我给你2000 另外给4000买那些野兽
I'll give you 2, 000, and 4, 000 for the beasts.

419
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,850
既然是老朋友 一共给你5000
That's 5, 000 for an old friend.

420
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:55,900
快一点 还有多久才能回到家
Come on! How long does it take to get into my own house?

421
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,920
我是普罗西莫
I am Proximo.

422
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:01,150
接下来的几天 将是你们悲惨的日子
I shall be closer to you for the next few days,

423
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,450
结束前的最后的几天 我会和你们异常的亲近
which will be the last of your miserable lives,

424
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:07,880
胜过把你们带到这世界来的该死的母亲
than that bitch of a mother that brought you screaming into this world.

425
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,510
我不是花钱买你们来做伴的
I did not pay good money for you for your company.

426
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:15,930
我出钱是为了从你们的死亡中获利
I paid it so that I could profit from your death.

427
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:20,440
你们的人生开始时 有母亲在旁边
And as your mother was there at your beginning,

428
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,030
结束时 我会在你们的身旁
so I shall be there at your end.

429
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:28,570
等到死亡的命运降临时
And when you die, and die you shall,

430
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:32,410
你们将因人们的欢呼而升华
your transition shall be to the sound of...

431
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,580
角斗士们
Gladiators,

432
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:41,250
我向你们致敬
I salute you.

433
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:47,050
红色
Red.

434
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:54,470
黄色
Yellow.

435
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:06,320
很好
Good.

436
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:08,490
红色
- Red. - Red.

437
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:14,700
西班牙人
Spaniard.

438
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:50,400
到此为止
That's enough for the moment!

439
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,360
他迟早得认命的
His time will come.

440
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:56,450
下一个
Next.

441
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,130
西班牙佬
Spaniard,

442
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:14,430
你为什么不还手
why don't you fight?

443
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,250
我们必须要搏斗
We all have to fight.

444
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,060
我决不搏斗
Well, I don't fight.

445
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:21,920
我不应在这里 我是书吏 我负责记录
I shouldn't be here, I'm a scribe, I write down words,

446
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,880
我会说七种语言
and speak seven languages.

447
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,020
那好
Good.

448
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,980
明天你可用七种语言尖叫
Tomorrow, you can scream in seven languages.

449
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:40,620
或许书吏是例外 可以赢取自由
Perhaps the scribe will be the one who wins his freedom.

450
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,910
自由
Freedom?

451
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,830
我需要做什么
What do I have to do?

452
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,530
你进竞技场 杀了我
You go in the arena and you kill me.

453
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,000
还有他
And him,

454
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:52,700
和这努米底亚人
and the Numidian,

455
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,380
和这逃兵
and the deserter.

456
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:57,410
再多100个人
And 100 more.

457
00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:00,350
直到你杀了所有斗士 你便自由了
And when there's no more to fight, you're free.

458
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,770
我做不到
I can't do that.

459
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:05,020
做不到
No?

460
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,690
但我做得到
But I can.

461
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:30,420
那是你信奉的神吗
Is that the sign of your gods?

462
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:37,720
这样做他们不会生气吗
Will that not anger them?

463
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,700
神眷顾你
The gods favor you.

464
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:03,240
红色是天神的颜色
Red is the gods' color.

465
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,790
今天你会需要他们帮助
You will need their help today.

466
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,790
普罗西莫
Proximo!

467
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:55,280
一直是日耳曼领导的
Still leading with the German?

468
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,460
观众喜欢野蛮人
The crowd love a barbarian.

469
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,830
而且他令我富有
Besides that, he's making me rich.

470
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:02,550
那努米底亚人搏斗过没有
Has that Numidian fought before?

471
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:04,960
没有 第一次
No, first time.

472
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,020
那个 是奴隶 士兵
And that one, laborer, soldier?

473
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:09,670
他是西班牙人
He's a Spaniard.

474
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:12,860
在场上像个废人一样
He might as well be a eunuch for what he brings to the ring.

475
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:18,010
五百元买努米底亚人 和西班牙人那队会过关
500 sestertii, the Numidian and Spaniard team makes it through.

476
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:21,820
一千元 如果努米底亚人独自过关
And 1, 000, that the Numidian makes it through alone.

477
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:26,450
你要我买自己的人输
Are you asking me to bet against my own man?

478
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:29,770
那是不道德的
It's unethical.

479
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:31,750
如果我加到二千元呢
What if I make it 2, 000?

480
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,100
你们当中有些人不愿意上场搏斗
Some of you are thinking you won't fight,

481
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:51,690
有些觉得你不能搏斗
some that you can't fight.

482
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:56,520
他们都喜欢唱高调 除非真正轮到自己出场
They all say that until they're out there.

483
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,470
你们听
Listen.

484
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:03,490
- 杀 杀 杀 - 杀 杀 杀
- Kill! Kill! Kill! - Kill! Kill! Kill!

485
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,330
把刀用力刺进别人的身体里
Thrust this into another mars flesh,

486
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:16,400
观众会为此而向你喝彩 崇拜你
and they will applaud and love you for that.

487
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,920
而你
And you,

488
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,840
你也会开始为了喝彩声
you may begin to love them

489
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,090
而爱上他们
for that.

490
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:31,680
最终 我们都会化为一堆枯骨
Ultimately, we're all dead men.

491
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:36,520
可悲的是 我们无权选择命运 但
Sadly, we cannot choose how,

492
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:40,570
有权决定如何面对死亡
but we can decide how we meet that end,

493
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:43,990
惟有如此 才能作为人
in order that we are remembered

494
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:47,140
被人们追忆
as men.

495
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,280
快
Come on!

496
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:53,540
左边的 拿盾牌
On the left, draw your shields!

497
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,960
右边的 拿剑
On the right, draw your swords!

498
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:59,800
- 杀 杀 - 杀 杀
- Kill! Kill! Kill! - Kill! Kill! Kill!

499
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,340
两人一组 红色和黄色一起
Pair them up, red with yellow.

500
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:09,600
下一个
Next!

501
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,560
打
Move!

502
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:34,910
夺权者
Usurper!

503
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,330
- 滚开 - 我们不要你统治 康莫德斯
- Go away! - You'll never rule us, Commodus!

504
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:35,450
他像个凯旋的英雄般回到罗马 但他到底征服了什么呢
He enters Rome like a conquering hero. But what has he conquered?

505
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:38,140
给他点时间 格瑞克斯 他还年轻
Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.

506
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,530
我相信他可以做的很好
I think he could do very well.

507
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:42,830
为罗马还是为你
For Rome, or for you?

508
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:52,210
卢修斯 去欢迎你的母亲 她会很高兴的
Go to your mother, Lucius. It's what she'd like.

509
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:00,720
- 卢修斯 - 妈妈
- Lucius! - Mother!

510
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,540
向你致敬 凯撒
Hail, Caesar.

511
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:06,140
议员们
Senators.

512
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:12,670
罗马欢迎她的新皇帝
Rome greets her new emperor.

513
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:16,300
你忠心的臣子们向你表示欢迎 陛下
Your loyal subjects bid you welcome, Highness.

514
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,220
谢谢你 佛克
Thank you, Falco.

515
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:22,390
说到忠心的子民 我相信他们并不太昂贵
And for the loyal subjects, I trust they werert too expensive.

516
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:24,480
- 凯撒 - 格瑞克斯
- Caesar. - Gracchus.

517
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,060
罗马为你的归来而欢呼 凯撒
All Rome rejoices in your return, Caesar.

518
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:30,670
有许多政务等你来处理
But there are many matters that require your attention.

519
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:36,010
请肃静 肃静
To order, please. To order.

520
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:38,240
凯撒 为了请你指引
For your guidance, Caesar,

521
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,120
凯撒 元老院已经拟订一系列的议程 好方便陛下过目
the Senate has prepared a series of protocols

522
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:44,290
开始解决城市里的众多问题
to begin addressing the many problems in the city,

523
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:48,480
首先是希腊区的基础卫生设备
beginning with basic sanitation for the Greek Quarter,

524
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,590
设法消灭该区正在蔓延的瘟疫
to combat the plague which is already springing up there.

525
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:54,480
所以 如果凯撒
So, if Caesar...

526
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:58,530
你难道还不明白 格瑞克斯
Don't you see, Gracchus?

527
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:02,240
这才是问题的重点 不是吗
That's the very problem, isn't it?

528
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:05,330
我父亲花费毕生的时间
My father spent all his time at study,

529
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:10,460
研读书本中的知识和哲学
at books of learning and philosophy.

530
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:14,960
他的晚年尽在阅读元老院的卷轴中度过
He spent his twilight hours reading scrolls from the Senate.

531
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:19,130
然而自始至终 他却忽略了人民
And all the while, the people were forgotten.

532
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:21,910
但元老会就代表人民 陛下
But the senate is the people, sire,

533
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:25,560
由人民中选出议员 为人民说话
chosen from among the people to speak for the people.

534
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:29,850
我怀疑民众是否像你一样丰衣足食 格瑞克斯
I doubt many of the people eat so well as you do, Gracchus.

535
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,050
或是像盖尔斯一样妻妾成群
Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.

536
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:35,220
我自认了解我的子民
I think I understand my own people.

537
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:38,820
那么 根据您个人的多方面的经验
Then perhaps Caesar will be so good as to teach us,

538
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:41,860
陛下或许会不吝赐教
out of his own extensive experience.

539
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,290
我认为是爱
I call it love.

540
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:51,000
我会爱民如子 因为他们都是我的子民
I am their father. The people are my children.

541
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:53,780
我会将他们紧紧的拥抱在我的胸前
And I shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly.

542
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:57,340
陛下 你曾拥抱过身染瘟疫的人吗
Have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire?

543
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:06,260
没有 但如果你再打断我的话
No, but if you interrupt me again,

544
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:09,080
我保证你一定会的
I assure you that you shall.

545
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,520
议员 我弟弟非常疲倦
Senator, my brother is very tired.

546
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:16,690
把议程给我 凯撒应该照人民的意愿行事
Leave your list with me. Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.

547
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:22,200
夫人 你总是让人不能不服
My lady, as always, your lightest touch commands obedience.

548
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:31,580
他们凭什么对我说教
Who are they to lecture me?

549
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:34,400
康莫德斯 元老院自有它的用处
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

550
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,380
什么用处 他们只会耍嘴皮子
What uses? All they do is talk.

551
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:43,120
根本就只需要 你和我
It should be just you and me and Rome.

552
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:46,550
千万不可以这么想 元老院自建国之初就存在着
Don't even think it. There's always been a Senate.

553
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:48,710
罗马已经变了
Rome has changed.

554
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:51,850
只要有一个皇帝 就可以治理帝国了
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.

555
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:54,210
当然 让人民继续拥有
Of course, but leave the people their...

556
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:55,690
幻想
Illusions?

557
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:58,730
传统
Traditions.

558
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:02,400
我父亲对野蛮人发动战争
My father's war against the barbarians.

559
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:06,640
他自己也承认那毫无意义 但是人民敬爱他
He said it himself, it achieved nothing. But the people loved him.

560
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,600
人民总是喜欢胜利的感觉的
The people always love victories.

561
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:12,370
为什么 他们并没有目睹战争的残酷
Why? They didn't see the battles.

562
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:15,650
日耳曼人和他们毫不相关
What do they care about Germania?

563
01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:18,070
他们只关心罗马的富强
They care about the greatness of Rome.

564
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:20,090
"罗马的富强"
"The greatness of Rome."

565
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:23,840
那到底是什么呢
Well, what is that?

566
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:29,760
是一种理念 富强
It's an idea. Greatness.

567
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:36,940
- 富强是一种憧憬 - 没错 一个憧憬
- Greatness is a vision. - Exactly. A vision.

568
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:40,980
你还不明白吗 露西拉
Do you not see, Lucilla?

569
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:46,320
我会给人民一个罗马的新憧憬 他们会为此而敬爱我
I will give the people a vision of Rome, and they'll love me for it.

570
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:51,370
他们很快就会忘掉那几个爱说教的老头
And they'll soon forget the tedious sermonizing of a few dry old men.

571
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:06,090
我会给罗马人民一个前所未有的憧憬
I will give the people the greatest vision of their lives.

572
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:48,430
斗士 - 暴力

573
01:08:57,210 --> 01:09:00,230
酒 酒 酒 红酒白酒任君畅饮
White and red wine for your drinking pleasure!

574
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:09,700
竞技
Games.

575
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:15,040
整整150天的竞技活动
One hundred and fifty days of games.

576
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,060
他比我想像中的要聪明
He's cleverer than I thought.

577
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:20,710
聪明 要不是因为害怕他的禁卫队
Clever. The whole of Rome would be laughing at him,

578
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,780
全罗马的人都会嘲笑他的
if they werert so afraid of his Praetorians.

579
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:26,670
害怕和好奇 强而有力的组合
Fear and wonder. A powerful combination.

580
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:31,200
你真的认为民众会被他的手段所欺骗
You really think the people are going to be seduced by that?

581
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,390
我觉得他了解罗马的本质 罗马是由一群乌合之众组成的
I think he knows what Rome is. Rome is the mob.

582
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,220
变魔术给他们看 就可以转移他们的注意力
Conjure magic for them, and they'll be distracted.

583
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:42,060
夺去他们的自由 他们还是会继续哄堂大笑
Take away their freedom, and still they'll roar.

584
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:46,970
维系着罗马命脉的 并不是元老院里的大理石
The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate.

585
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:49,070
而是竞技场内的沙地
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

586
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:53,110
他会把死亡带给人民
He'll bring them death,

587
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:57,240
而人民会为此而敬爱他
and they will love him for it.

588
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:22,000
你只需杀杀杀
All you do is kill, kill, kill.

589
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,500
观众不是要屠夫 他们要英雄
The crowd don't want a butcher, they want a hero.

590
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:26,630
我们要他们不断回来看
We want them to keep coming back.

591
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:30,900
所以不要只顾把他们斩杀 记着你是要娱乐观众
So don't just hack them to pieces, remember you are an entertainer.

592
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:34,860
西班牙人
Spaniard.

593
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:44,210
快去娱乐他们
So entertain!

594
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:53,440
你们还不满意吗 你们还不满意吗
Are you not entertained? Are you not entertained?

595
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,990
你们不正是为此而来这里的吗
Is this not why you're here?

596
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:05,620
西班牙人
Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

597
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:10,080
- 西班牙人 西班牙人 西班牙人 - 西班牙人 西班牙人 西班牙人
- Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard! - Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

598
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:24,640
你想要些什么
What do you want?

599
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:28,350
女孩
Girl?

600
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:30,560
男孩
Boy?

601
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:33,730
- 你找我有事 - 是的
- You sent for me. - Yes, I did.

602
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,890
西班牙人 你的确很棒 但你还不是最厉害的
You're good, Spaniard, but you're not that good.

603
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:39,140
你可以变的更优秀
You could be magnificent.

604
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:42,740
我杀人是因为你要我这么做 这样就够了
I'm required to kill, so I kill. That is enough.

605
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:46,660
也许在乡下小地方是够了 但在罗马却行不通
That's enough for the provinces, but not for Rome.

606
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:53,950
那年轻皇帝安排了一系列表演
The young emperor has arranged a series of spectacles

607
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:58,220
来纪念他的父亲 马可・奥勒留
to commemorate his father, Marcus Aurelius.

608
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:00,720
我觉得很好笑
I find that amusing,

609
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:04,120
因为正是马可・奥勒留
since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise,

610
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:07,680
博学 无所不知的马可・奥勒留 禁止了搏斗竞技活动
the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius, that closed us down.

611
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:14,800
在这个跳蚤为患的村庄
So finally, after five years of scratching a living

612
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,090
生活了五年以后
in flea-infested villages,

613
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:20,240
我们终于要回到属于我们的地方
we're finally going back to where we belong.

614
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:22,530
罗马竞技场
The Colosseum.

615
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:27,580
你应该去看看竞技场 西班牙人
You should see the Colosseum, Spaniard.

616
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:30,960
五万罗马观众
Fifty thousand Romans,

617
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:35,750
注视着你斗剑时的一举一动
watching every movement of your sword,

618
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:39,670
期待你挥出致命的一击
willing you to make that killer blow.

619
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:44,470
在你挥剑之前的寂静 和那之后的骚动
The silence before you strike and the noise afterwards.

620
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:49,100
喧闹声不断的提高
It rises. It rises up,

621
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:51,940
就像 一场暴风雨
like a storm.

622
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:55,380
而你自己就是雷神
As if you were the thunder god himself.

623
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:58,440
- 你曾是个角斗士 - 对 我是
- You were a gladiator? - Yes, I was.

624
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:07,060
你赢得了你的自由
You won your freedom?

625
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:09,500
很久以前 皇帝
A long time ago, the Emperor

626
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:13,230
送给我一把剑
presented me with a rudius.

627
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:16,040
那只是一把木剑
It's just a wooden sword.

628
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:20,010
你得到自由的象征
The symbol of your freedom.

629
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:25,180
他用木剑点了点我的肩 我便获得了自由
He touched me on the shoulder, and I was free.

630
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:28,960
你认识马可・奥勒留
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

631
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:33,310
我没说我认识他 我说他曾经碰过我的肩膀
I did not say I knew him. I said he touched me on the shoulder once.

632
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,020
你问我到底想要什么
You asked me what I want.

633
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:40,320
我也希望站在皇帝面前
I, too, want to stand in front of the Emperor,

634
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:42,970
就像你一样
as you did.

635
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:46,490
那你就得听我的 向我学习
Then listen to me. Learn from me.

636
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:50,410
我并不是最棒的 因为我杀人太快了
I wasrt the best because I killed quickly.

637
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,290
我之所以是最棒的 是因为民众崇拜我
I was the best because the crowd loved me.

638
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:58,710
赢取观众的心 你就能赢得自由
Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom.

639
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,050
我会赢得观众的心
I will win the crowd.

640
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:10,720
我将让他们看见从未见过的东西
I will give them something they've never seen before.

641
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:14,730
那么 西班牙人 我们一起去罗马
So, Spaniard, we shall go to Rome together

642
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:17,210
展开一趟血腥的冒险
and have bloody adventures.

643
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:19,090
观众会让我们的荷包撑满
And the great whore will suckle us

644
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:21,760
开心的笑不出来
until we are fat and happy and can suckle no more.

645
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,320
然后
And then,

646
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:26,570
杀了足够多的人后
when enough men have died,

647
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:31,200
也许你就可以得到你的自由
perhaps you will have your freedom.

648
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,960
接着 这个给你
Here. Use this.

649
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:04,860
在远处的某个地方 有我的祖国
It's somewhere out there, my country.

650
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:07,280
我的家
My home.

651
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:10,620
我的妻子正在准备食物
My wife is preparing food.

652
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:14,290
我的女儿从河边打水回来
My daughters carry water from the river.

653
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,670
我还能再见到他们吗
Will I ever see them again?

654
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:20,460
我想没机会了
I think, no.

655
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:23,200
你相信死后能再见到他们吗
Do you believe you'll see them again when you die?

656
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,670
我相信
I think so.

657
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,380
但是 我很快就会死了
But then, I will die soon.

658
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:32,470
他们会再活很多年
They will not die for many years.

659
01:16:33,170 --> 01:16:34,920
我得等他们
I'll have to wait.

660
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:37,190
但是你愿意 等
But you would? Wait?

661
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:39,190
当然
Of course.

662
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:42,480
你知道的
You see,

663
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:47,200
我的妻儿
my wife and my son

664
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:51,060
已经在等着我了
are already waiting for me.

665
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:54,830
你会再见到他们的 只是时候未到
You'll meet them again. But not yet.

666
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:00,250
时候未到
Not yet.

667
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:03,540
- 除非 - 时候未到
- Unless... - Not yet.

668
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:08,840
时候未到
Not yet.

669
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:23,270
他在那里
There he is.

670
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:13,530
出来
Out.

671
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,660
快出来
Move, go, out!

672
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,880
老朋友 真高兴又看见你
Good to see you again, old friend.

673
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,930
带给我财富
Bring me fortune.

674
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:46,400
你以前看见过这么壮观的建筑吗
Have you ever seen anything like that before?

675
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:50,070
我不知道他们是如何办到的
I didn't know men could build such things.

676
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:01,620
赢得观众的心
Win the crowd.

677
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:04,150
快进去 走
Get inside. Move.

678
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:05,540
进去
Inside.

679
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:57,510
他睡的好香因为他备受宠爱
He sleeps so well because he's loved.

680
01:20:00,330 --> 01:20:02,520
走吧 弟弟 已经很晚了
Come, brother. It's late.

681
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,940
我将使罗马成为当代的奇迹
I will make Rome the wonder of the ages.

682
01:20:11,630 --> 01:20:15,070
那是格瑞克斯和他的朋友所不明白的
That is what Gracchus and his friends don't understand.

683
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:18,700
我的欲望在脑海中起伏 让我头痛欲裂
All my desires are splitting my head to pieces.

684
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:28,500
康莫德斯 喝了这苏打水
Commodus, drink this tonic.

685
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:40,510
我看时机已经成熟
I think the time is almost right.

686
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:43,790
我可以在悼念父亲的庆典上
I could announce the dissolution of the Senate

687
01:20:43,790 --> 01:20:45,960
宣布解散元老院
at the celebration to honor our father.

688
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,020
你认为我该这么做吗
Do you think I should?

689
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:50,690
人民能接受吗
Are the people ready?

690
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:55,190
我想你现在需要休息
I think you need your rest now.

691
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,930
你会不会留下来陪我
Will you stay with me?

692
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:05,450
弟弟 你还是怕黑吗
Still afraid of the dark, brother?

693
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:13,420
是的
Still.

694
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,550
永远都怕
Always.

695
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:21,140
- 今晚留下来陪我 - 你知道那不可能
- Stay with me tonight. - You know I won't.

696
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,140
那就吻我一下
Then kiss me.

697
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,490
晚安 弟弟
Sleep, brother.

698
01:22:30,190 --> 01:22:32,400
又聋又哑的仆人
Having servants who are deaf and mute

699
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,250
至少让我活得久一点
at least ensures I live a little longer.

700
01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:39,360
他们在拘捕学者
They're arresting scholars now.

701
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:43,300
任何敢表达意见的 甚至包括作家和史学家
Anyone who dare speak out. Even satirists and chroniclers.

702
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:45,850
还有数学家
And mathematicians.

703
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,180
全部送到斗兽场
And all to feed the arena.

704
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:53,250
国会没有通过戒严法
The Senate did not approve martial law.

705
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:56,190
这全是禁卫军的恐怖势力
This reign of terror is entirely the Praetorians.

706
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:59,470
我入黑后不敢外出
I'm afraid to go out after dark.

707
01:22:59,470 --> 01:23:03,100
你更应担心日间的出行
You should be more afraid of your activities during the day.

708
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:07,910
国会中布满他的线眼 由那好色的科高领导的
The Senate is full of his spies, led by that whore master, Falco.

709
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:13,660
究竟他在想什么 那是最令我困惑的
But what is in his mind? That's what I trouble myself with.

710
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:17,360
他整天只顾
He spends all his days singularly obsessed,

711
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,280
筹划你父亲的纪念庆典
planning the festival to honor your father.

712
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:23,970
他连政府最基本的工作也忽略
He neglects even the most fundamental task of government.

713
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:26,930
他到底在计划什么
So just what is he planning?

714
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,910
用什么来支付
And what pays for it?

715
01:23:28,910 --> 01:23:33,230
每天这些竞技支出庞大 但我们没加新税项
These daily games are costing a fortune, yet we have no new taxes.

716
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:35,390
未来
The future.

717
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:38,810
用未来支付
The future pays for it.

718
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:43,140
他已开始卖贮备的谷物
He's started selling the grain reserves.

719
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:45,070
不是吧
This can't be true.

720
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,200
他在卖罗马贮备的谷物
He's selling Rome's reserves of grain.

721
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:51,700
人民在两年后便会捱饿
The people will be starving in two years.

722
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:53,730
希望他们享受这游戏
I hope they're enjoying the games,

723
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:57,210
那些竞技不久他们便会因此而灭亡
because soon enough they'll be dead because of them.

724
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,880
- 罗马人要知道真相 - 怎样
- Rome must know this. - And how?

725
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:02,760
他打算解散国会
He's going to dissolve the Senate.

726
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:06,930
谁会及时告诉他们 你 格瑞克斯
And who will tell them before it's too late? You, Gracchus?

727
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,750
你 盖尔斯
You, Gaius.

728
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:11,540
你会否在国会上发表演说
Will you make a speech on the floor of the Senate,

729
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:13,390
指责我哥哥
denouncing my brother?

730
01:24:13,830 --> 01:24:16,480
然后看着你全家被推进斗兽场
And then see your family in the Colosseum?

731
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:18,810
谁敢
Who'd dare?

732
01:24:27,890 --> 01:24:31,020
我每天都活在恐惧中
I have been living in a prison of fear every day,

733
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:33,700
因为我儿子是皇位继承人
because my son is heir to the throne.

734
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:40,790
他一定要死
He must die.

735
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:48,910
但昆塔斯和禁卫军会夺去控制权
Quintus and the Praetorians would simply seize control for themselves.

736
01:24:48,910 --> 01:24:52,870
不 把领导者杀了就不会失去控制权
No. Cut off the head and the snake cannot strike.

737
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:55,000
露西娜 盖尔斯说得对
Lucilla, Gaius is right.

738
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,230
不能压制禁卫军的话 我们不会成功
Until we can neutralize the Praetorians, we can achieve nothing.

739
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:02,260
那我们坐以待毙
So we do nothing?

740
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:05,150
不 我们在暗中计划
No, child. We keep our counsel.

741
01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:07,490
我们准备
We prepare.

742
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:13,120
人民支持他 我们的声音便没有力量
As long as the people support him, we are voices without steel.

743
01:25:13,810 --> 01:25:15,330
我们是空气
We are air.

744
01:25:18,230 --> 01:25:21,110
但每天他都在竖敌
But with every day that passes, he makes enemies.

745
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:24,090
终有一天 他的敌人会多过朋友
One day, he'll have more enemies than friends.

746
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,460
那就是我们行动的时候
And on that day, we will act.

747
01:25:27,950 --> 01:25:29,930
那时我们便反击
Then we will strike.

748
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:32,600
在那刻来临前
But until then,

749
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:35,350
我们是听话的
we are docile.

750
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:37,980
我们是服从的
We are obedient.

751
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:41,560
而我们亦是不忠的
And we are treacherous.

752
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:51,360
快
Come on!

753
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:02,250
好了 够了
All right, that's enough.

754
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:26,130
皇帝想看搏斗
The Emperor wants battles,

755
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:28,380
但我不想牺牲最好的斗士
and I don't want to sacrifice my best fighters.

756
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:31,800
观众想看竞技 所以皇帝就举办大型的竞技搏斗
The crowd wants battles, so the Emperor gives them battles.

757
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:35,490
- 你的人将参加迦太基的战役 - 迦太基的大屠杀
- You get the battle of Can'thage. - Massacre of Can'thage.

758
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:38,850
你为什么不把监狱里的
Well, why don't you go down to the prison,

759
01:26:38,850 --> 01:26:40,940
乞丐小偷都找来
round up all the beggars and thieves?

760
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:42,190
我们早就这么做了
We've done that.

761
01:26:42,190 --> 01:26:44,650
如果你想要我牺牲
If you want to give away the best gladiators

762
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:45,900
全帝国最棒的角斗士
in the whole of the empire,

763
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:48,110
就得给我双倍的钱
then I want double the rates.

764
01:26:48,110 --> 01:26:51,990
我们要么按照合约给钱 要么就取消合约
You'll get your contract rates, or you'll get your contract canceled.

765
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:53,490
你不高兴吗
You don't like it?

766
01:26:53,490 --> 01:26:57,550
那就滚回你的老家去
Then you can crawl back down that shit hole that you came from.

767
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:02,810
等等 卡西亚斯
Cassius, please. You can free us.

768
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:35,740
你就是外号"西班牙人"的角斗士吗
Gladiator, are you the one they call the Spaniard?

769
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:36,970
是的
Yes.

770
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:39,960
他们都说你力大无穷
They said you were a giant.

771
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:43,210
他们说你单手就能捏碎大人的头
They said you could crush a mars skull with one hand.

772
01:27:43,210 --> 01:27:45,060
大人的 不可能
A mars? No.

773
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:47,730
小孩的也许可以
A boy's.

774
01:27:49,630 --> 01:27:53,280
- 西班牙有良种马吗 - 有最优秀的马
- Do they have good horses in Spain? - Some of the best.

775
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:57,410
这是银子 这是黑点
This is Argento and this is Scan'to.

776
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:00,620
他们是我的马
They were my horses.

777
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,620
可是被别人抢走了
They were taken from me.

778
01:28:03,810 --> 01:28:07,210
我很喜欢你 西班牙人 我会替你加油的
I like you, Spaniard. I shall cheer for you.

779
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:11,070
- 他们准你看竞技比赛 - 我舅舅说这会使我变得勇敢
- They let you watch the games? - My uncle says it makes me strong.

780
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:14,470
- 那你父亲怎样说 - 我父亲死了
- And what does your father say? - My father is dead.

781
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:18,300
卢修斯少爷 该走了
Master Lucius, it is time.

782
01:28:19,450 --> 01:28:20,910
我得走了
I have to go.

783
01:28:20,910 --> 01:28:22,600
你叫卢修斯
Your name is Lucius?

784
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:27,390
卢修斯维勒斯 为了纪念我父亲
Lucius Verus, after my father.

785
01:28:57,950 --> 01:28:59,760
往下放
Lower!

786
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:07,790
- 哥地亚斯 - 是
- Claudius! - Yes?

787
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:10,310
- 克劳迪亚斯 还要更多的盾牌 - 好的 长官
- More shields! - All right.

788
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:34,150
当皇上进场时 举起你们的武器向他致敬
When the Emperor enters, raise your weapons, salute him,

789
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:36,300
然后齐声向他问候
and then speak together.

790
01:29:36,990 --> 01:29:40,590
面对着皇帝 不可以背对着他
Face the Emperor and don't turn your back on him.

791
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:44,560
去吧 为荣誉而战
Go, and die with honor.

792
01:30:39,510 --> 01:30:41,700
欢迎伟大的凯撒
Hail, mighty Caesar!

793
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:49,160
- 凯撒万岁 凯撒万岁 - 凯撒万岁 凯撒万岁
- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! - Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

794
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:55,170
- 角斗士们向您致敬 - 角斗士们向您致敬
- We who are about to die salute you! - We who are about to die salute you!

795
01:30:56,780 --> 01:30:58,460
今天
On this day

796
01:30:59,070 --> 01:31:02,170
我们把战场移到神圣的古代
we reach back to hallowed antiquity

797
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:06,700
呈现在各位面前的是
to bring you a re-creation of the second fall

798
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:08,850
迦太基沦亡的历史战役
of mighty Can'thage!

799
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:16,980
在荒芜的扎马平原上
On the barren plain of Zama

800
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:20,690
汉尼拔将军的
there stood the invincible armies

801
01:31:20,970 --> 01:31:23,700
不可战胜的野蛮人军队正严阵以待
of the barbarian Hannibal.

802
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:27,560
来自所有残暴民族的
Ferocious mercenaries and warriors

803
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:30,020
佣兵和战士们
from all brute nations,

804
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:34,410
毫不留情的破坏
bent on merciless destruction,

805
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:36,670
征服
conquest.

806
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:41,610
你们的皇帝很荣幸的为大家介绍
Your emperor is pleased to give you

807
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:44,760
野蛮的异帮人
the barbarian horde!

808
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,090
有人在军队里服役过吗
Anyone here been in the army?

809
01:31:55,090 --> 01:31:58,110
有 我曾在凡度巴纳和你一起服役
Yes. I served with you at Vindobona.

810
01:31:58,970 --> 01:32:00,730
你可以帮我忙
You can help me.

811
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:04,570
不管从铁门后出现的是什么
Whatever comes out of these gates,

812
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:09,100
我们只有同心协力才会有较大的胜算
we've got a better chance of survival ifwe work together.

813
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:10,910
你明白吗
Do you understand?

814
01:32:12,940 --> 01:32:15,060
只有团结一致 我们才能活命
Lfwe stay together, we survive.

815
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:18,280
我很荣幸为你们介绍
The Emperor is pleased to bring you the legionnaires

816
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:21,960
非洲的西比欧军团
of Scipio Africanus!

817
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:34,470
奋战到底
To the death!

818
01:32:38,170 --> 01:32:40,860
- 杀 杀 杀 - 杀 杀 杀
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! - Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

819

大家靠拢
Stay close.

纵队交错排列
Stay close. Staggered columns!

822
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:14,810
你没机会了
You don't have a chance.

823
01:33:26,050 --> 01:33:28,700
固定盾牌 紧密衔接
Lock your shields. Stay as one.

824

稳住

01:33:33,730 --> 01:33:36,830
稳住 盾牌衔接起来
Hold! As one!

826
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:41,080
做得好
Well done.

827
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:56,810
稳住 下面
Hold. Down low!

828
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:03,810
好
Yes!

829
01:34:15,810 --> 01:34:17,160
贺格
Hagen!

830
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:44,810
一队去移战车 一队 跟我来
This column to the chariot! This column stay with me!

831
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:49,820
快点
Quickly!

832
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:53,240
- 去前面 - 快
- Get out there. - Hurry!

833
01:35:34,350 --> 01:35:35,610
马西墨斯
Maximus!

834
01:35:47,740 --> 01:35:50,250
单排队形 排成一排
Single column! Single column!

835
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:36,970
我们赢了
We win!

836
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:44,850
我对历史不太清楚 卡西亚斯
My history's a little hazy, Cassius,

837
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:48,590
不过应该是野蛮人打输了迦太基战役吧
but shouldn't the barbarians lose the battle of Can'thage?

838
01:36:48,590 --> 01:36:50,440
是的 陛下
Yes, sire.

839
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:53,720
请见谅 陛下
Forgive me, sire.

840
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:56,530
没关系 我喜欢惊喜
No, I rather enjoy surprises.

841
01:36:57,220 --> 01:36:58,430
他是谁
Who is he?

842
01:36:58,430 --> 01:37:01,530
他们叫他做西班牙人 陛下
They call him the Spaniard, sire.

843
01:37:03,940 --> 01:37:05,940
我想见见他
I think I'll meet him.

844
01:37:05,940 --> 01:37:07,370
是 陛下
Yes, sire.

845
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:11,500
为野蛮人欢呼
Hail to the barbarians!

846
01:37:26,330 --> 01:37:29,850
前进 严密戒备
Forward! Arms at ready!

847
01:37:43,310 --> 01:37:45,080
放下武器
Drop your weapons.

848
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:52,040
皇帝要见你 角斗士
Gladiator, the Emperor has asked for you.

849
01:37:52,530 --> 01:37:54,880
我随时听候差遣
I am at the Emperor's service.

850
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:23,700
起身 起身
Rise. Rise.

851
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:35,280
西班牙人 你果然名不虚传
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard.

852
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,860
我相信其他的角斗士都不是你的对手
I don't think there's ever been a gladiator to match you.

853
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:40,870
这位年轻人坚持你是赫克托转世
As for this young man, he insists you are Hector reborn.

854
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:42,550
还是你是大力神的化身
Or was it Hercules?

855
01:38:43,870 --> 01:38:47,810
你为何不表明身份 告诉大家你的真名
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself and tell us all your real name?

856
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:51,480
你总有名字吧
You do have a name.

857
01:38:52,170 --> 01:38:54,150
"角斗士"就是我的名字
My name is Gladiator.

858
01:38:57,340 --> 01:39:00,610
你竟敢背对着我 奴隶
How dare you show your back to me? Slave!

859
01:39:01,890 --> 01:39:05,320
脱掉头盔 告诉我你的名字
You will remove your helmet and tell me your name.

860
01:39:16,990 --> 01:39:19,590
我叫马西墨斯德西斯梅里丢斯
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius,

861
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:21,910
北方军队的指挥官
commander of the armies of the north,

862
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:24,330
菲力克斯军团的将军
general of the Felix Legions,

863
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:27,720
真正的皇帝马可・奥勒留忠心的仆人
loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius,

864
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,310
儿子被人谋杀
father to a murdered son,

865
01:39:31,670 --> 01:39:34,060
妻子遭人杀害
husband to a murdered wife,

866
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:38,150
不管今生或来世 我定会为他们复仇
and I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.

867
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:46,530
卫兵
Arms!

868
01:39:59,530 --> 01:40:02,950
活 活 活 活 活 活
Live! Live! Live! Live!

869
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:06,260
- 活 活 活 - 活 活 活
- Live! Live! Live! Live! - Live! Live! Live! Live!

870
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:52,970
卫兵 退下
Arms, at rest!

871
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:49,950
- 马西墨斯 马西墨斯 - 马西墨斯 马西墨斯
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! - Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

872
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:39,200
父亲
Father.

873
01:43:53,470 --> 01:43:55,450
他怎么还活着
Why is he still alive?

874
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:58,200
我不知道
I don't know.

875
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:00,280
他应该早就死了
He shouldn't be alive.

876
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:02,540
实在让人烦恼
It vexes me.

877
01:44:04,190 --> 01:44:06,080
我非常生气
I'm terribly vexed.

878
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:19,220
我只是做了不得不做的事
I did what I had to do.

879
01:44:19,870 --> 01:44:24,000
要是按照父亲的意愿 罗马早就解体了
If Father had had his way, the empire would have been torn apart.

880
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,770
你明白的 是吗
You do see that.

881
01:44:26,050 --> 01:44:27,310
是的
Yes.

882
01:44:32,010 --> 01:44:35,320
你看到他的时候有何感觉
What did you feel when you saw him?

883
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:39,070
没有任何感觉
I felt nothing.

884
01:44:40,930 --> 01:44:43,580
看来他伤得你很深 对不对
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

885
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:46,830
我伤害他更深
No more than I wounded him.

886
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:53,630
在日耳曼的时候他们说谎
They lied to me in Germania.

887
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:57,340
他们告诉我他已经死了
They told me he was dead.

888
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:01,910
他们骗我 即是不尊重我
If they lie to me, they don't respect me.

889
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:05,350
既然如此 他们又怎么可能爱我
If they don't respect me, how can they ever love me?

890
01:45:06,590 --> 01:45:09,050
那么你必须让军团了解
Then you must let the legions know

891
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:12,230
他们的背叛行为一定会受到惩罚
their treachery will not go unpunished.

892
01:45:12,970 --> 01:45:14,530
可怜的姐姐
Poor sister.

893
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:17,400
我绝对不想与你为敌
I wouldn't want to be your enemy.

894
01:45:18,510 --> 01:45:20,360
你打算怎么做
What will you do?

895
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:34,670
出来
This way.

896
01:46:09,940 --> 01:46:13,480
贵妇人付高价是为了让英勇的角斗士取悦她
Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions.

897
01:46:13,490 --> 01:46:16,090
我知道你弟弟会派刺客来
I knew your brother would send assassins.

898
01:46:16,490 --> 01:46:19,220
但我没想到他会派最好的来
I didn't realize he would send his best.

899
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:22,930
马西墨斯 他毫不知情
Maximus, he doesn't know.

900
01:46:23,790 --> 01:46:27,000
我的家人被钉在十字架上活活烧死
My family was burnt and crucified while they were still alive.

901
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,640
- 我真的不知情 - 别对我撒谎
- I knew nothing... - Don't lie to me!

902
01:46:36,010 --> 01:46:37,840
我为他们哭泣
I wept for them.

903
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:41,760
就像你为你父亲哭泣
As you wept for your father? As you wept for your father?

904
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:45,450
自从我父亲去世后 我便生活在恐惧之中
I have been living in a prison of fear since that day.

905
01:46:45,850 --> 01:46:49,790
因为害怕自己的弟弟而无法哀悼自己的父亲
To be unable to mourn your father for fear of your brother.

906
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:53,860
因为自己的儿子也是王位继承人
To live in terror every moment of every day,

907
01:46:53,860 --> 01:46:56,750
我时时刻刻都生活在恐惧之中
because your son is heir to the throne.

908
01:46:58,530 --> 01:47:00,090
我有哭过
I have wept.

909
01:47:01,330 --> 01:47:04,260
我儿子是无辜的
My son was innocent.

910
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,140
我儿子也是
So is mine.

911
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:12,230
难道非得用我儿子的命来换取你的信任
Must my son die, too, before you'll trust me?

912
01:47:13,590 --> 01:47:16,650
我是否信任你又有何区别
What does it matter if I trust you or not?

913
01:47:17,420 --> 01:47:20,550
你难道不明白 神已经宽恕你了
The gods have spared you. Don't you understand?

914
01:47:20,550 --> 01:47:24,100
今天我看见了比罗马皇帝还要有权力的奴隶
Today I saw a slave become more powerful than the emperor of Rome.

915
01:47:24,100 --> 01:47:25,970
诸神已经宽恕我了
The gods have spared me?

916
01:47:25,970 --> 01:47:29,520
因为他们的怜悯 我才有娱乐观众的力量
I am at their mercy, with the power only to amuse a mob.

917
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:31,160
那就是力量
That is power.

918
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:32,770
观众代表着罗马
The mob is Rome.

919
01:47:32,770 --> 01:47:36,500
康莫德斯控制了他们就等于掌控了一切
And while Commodus controls them, he controls everything.

920
01:47:36,740 --> 01:47:38,380
听我说
Listen to me.

921
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:42,030
元老院的大多数人都是我弟弟的敌人
My brother has enemies, most of all in the Senate.

922
01:47:42,030 --> 01:47:44,370
只是当人民都支持他的时候:
But while the people follow him,

923
01:47:44,370 --> 01:47:47,510
没有人敢和他正面冲突 除了你
no one would dare stand up to him until you.

924
01:47:48,370 --> 01:47:50,750
他们反对他 却什么事都不做
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.

925
01:47:50,750 --> 01:47:54,590
有些政治家为罗马奉献出全部的心力
There are some politicians who have dedicated their lives to Rome.

926
01:47:54,590 --> 01:47:56,440
他们有个领袖
One man above all.

927
01:47:57,420 --> 01:48:00,610
如果我出面安排 你愿意和他见面吗
If I can arrange it, will you meet him?

928
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:02,860
你到底明不明白
Do you not understand?

929
01:48:03,010 --> 01:48:07,310
我只是个奴隶 随时随地都有可能丧命
I may die in this cell tonight, or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!

930
01:48:07,310 --> 01:48:10,080
我又能改变些什么呢
What possible difference can I make?

931
01:48:10,270 --> 01:48:12,600
这个人有和你一样的目的
This man wants what you want.

932
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:14,910
那就让他去杀了康莫德斯
Then have him kill Commodus!

933
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:19,340
我曾经认识一个人
I knew a man once,

934
01:48:20,150 --> 01:48:21,550
一个高尚的人
a noble man.

935
01:48:22,450 --> 01:48:25,420
他不但有原则 而且还敬爱我的父亲
A man of principle who loved my father,

936
01:48:26,290 --> 01:48:28,470
我的父亲也爱他
and my father loved him.

937
01:48:30,330 --> 01:48:32,600
这个人为罗马贡献良多
This man served Rome well.

938
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:38,650
那人已经死了
That man is gone.

939
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:41,920
你弟弟干的很成功
Your brother did his work well.

940
01:48:41,930 --> 01:48:43,690
让我帮你
Let me help you.

941
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:52,700
对 你能帮我
Yes, you can help me.

942
01:48:55,940 --> 01:48:59,750
忘了我们曾经相识 再也不要来这里看我
Forget you ever knew me, never come here again.

943
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:06,170
守卫 这位夫人要离开了
Guard! The lady is finished with me.

944
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:36,290
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

945
01:49:39,190 --> 01:49:40,880
朱利安克拉苏
Julian Crassus.

946
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:47,630
名字
Name?

947
01:49:48,830 --> 01:49:50,430
马可斯 陛下
Marcus, sire.

948
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:53,050
跟我父亲同名
My father's name.

949
01:50:00,460 --> 01:50:02,710
他们在发现马西墨斯逃走时
They must have known of Maximus' escape,

950
01:50:02,710 --> 01:50:05,650
一定可以找到他们四个的尸体
when they found the bodies of the four men.

951
01:50:06,010 --> 01:50:08,690
他们以为是野蛮人突袭
They thought it was a barbarian raid.

952
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:12,910
他们是好人 陛下 他们忠于皇上
These are good men, sire. Loyal to the Emperor.

953
01:50:20,150 --> 01:50:21,960
搭箭
Load your arrows!

954
01:50:29,490 --> 01:50:31,510
准备放箭
Prepare to fire!

955
01:50:51,930 --> 01:50:55,320
又或者是你知道
Then perhaps it was you who knew,

956
01:50:56,060 --> 01:50:57,870
而不告诉我
and never told me.

957
01:50:58,020 --> 01:51:00,370
- 我并不知道 - 你不知道
- I didn't know. - You didn't know?

958
01:51:01,770 --> 01:51:04,710
但将军永远有控制权
But a general is always in control.

959
01:51:05,990 --> 01:51:09,760
永远是命令者 不是吗
Always in command, isn't he?

960
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:12,760
是的 凯撒
Yes, Caesar.

961
01:51:26,590 --> 01:51:29,400
那下命令吧 快说
Then give the command. Say it.

962
01:51:46,190 --> 01:51:47,420
放箭
Fire.

963
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:24,000
马西墨斯
Maximus.

964
01:52:24,650 --> 01:52:27,880
你指挥过军团 你打过很多胜仗
You commanded legions? You had many victories?

965
01:52:28,650 --> 01:52:30,960
- 是的 - 在日耳曼
- Yes. - In Germania?

966
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:34,630
在很多国家
In many countries.

967
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:37,550
将军
General.

968
01:53:26,540 --> 01:53:28,520
你已经出名了
You have a great name.

969
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:33,070
在杀你之前他得先羞辱你的名声
He must kill your name before he kills you.

970
01:53:41,930 --> 01:53:43,350
没错
Yes, at the far end.

971
01:53:43,350 --> 01:53:45,370
- 盖尔斯议员 - 你好
- Senator Gaius. - Hello.

972
01:53:45,770 --> 01:53:47,830
格瑞克斯议员
Senator Gracchus.

973
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:52,820
很难得看见你出现在这种龙蛇混杂的地方
Don't often see you enjoying the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.

974
01:53:52,820 --> 01:53:56,030
我不会假装和人民打成一片
I don't pretend to be a man of the people, Senator,

975
01:53:56,030 --> 01:53:58,670
但我会做个为人民说话的议员
but I do try to be a man for the people.

976
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:20,150
- 凯撒 凯撒 凯撒 凯撒 - 凯撒 凯撒 凯撒 凯撒
- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! - Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

977
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:26,290
罗马的人民
People of Rome!

978
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:31,040
今天是安提俄克战役的第四天
On the fourth day ofAntioch,

979
01:54:31,570 --> 01:54:36,050
同时也是竞技庆典的第64天
we can celebrate the 64th day of the games.

980
01:54:36,570 --> 01:54:40,920
在他的仁慈下
And in his majestic charity,

981
01:54:41,580 --> 01:54:45,890
皇帝决定赐予罗马人民
the Emperor has deigned this day to favor the people of Rome

982
01:54:46,370 --> 01:54:49,890
一场历史性的决战
with an historical final match.

983
01:54:50,590 --> 01:54:55,270
在退休五年后 重回竞技场
Returning to the Colosseum today, after five years in retirement,

984
01:54:56,590 --> 01:55:00,140
凯撒很高兴为大家请到
Caesar is pleased to bring you

985
01:55:00,140 --> 01:55:04,010
罗马历史上
the only undefeated champion

986
01:55:04,020 --> 01:55:06,060
唯一的不败冠军
in Roman history,

987
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:11,080
来自高卢的传奇的底格里斯
the legendary Tigris of Gaul!

988
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:35,800
他太清楚该如何操纵观众
He knows too well how to manipulate the mob.

989
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:38,590
马可・奥勒留的梦想是建立一个全新的罗马 普罗西莫
Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Rome, Proximo.

990
01:55:38,590 --> 01:55:41,470
但新罗马不应该是这样的
This is not it. This is not it!

991
01:55:41,470 --> 01:55:44,400
马可・奥勒留已经死了 马西墨斯
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.

992
01:55:45,140 --> 01:55:47,830
我们只是凡夫俗子 一切终归尘土
We mortals are but shadows and dust.

993
01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:50,600
一切终归尘土 马西墨斯
Shadows and dust, Maximus!

994
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:54,570
让我们隆重介绍
Representing the training lyceum ofAntonius Proximo,

995
01:55:54,570 --> 01:55:58,320
代表普罗西莫训练会馆的
Caesar is proud to give you

996
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:02,260
马西墨斯
Aelius Maximus!

997
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:17,420
他们把他当成自己人 敞开双臂欢迎他
They embrace him like he's one of their own.

998
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:21,440
观众是很善变的 弟弟 不出一个月就会忘记他的
The mob is fickle, brother. He'll be forgotten in a month.

999
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:27,030
错了 用不了那么久
No, much sooner than that.

1000
01:56:28,850 --> 01:56:30,740
一切都安排好了
It's been arranged.

1001
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:52,220
角斗士向你致敬
We who are about to die salute you.

1002
01:56:55,460 --> 01:56:57,350
我们支持你 马西墨斯
We're with you, Maximus!

1003
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:41,730
打败他
Fight on, finish it!

1004
01:58:09,870 --> 01:58:11,640
用力拉
Pull, pull!

1005
01:58:43,900 --> 01:58:45,540
放开 放开
Loose! Loose!

1006
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:15,740
- 杀了他 - 杀
- Gut him! - Kill!

1007
01:59:17,100 --> 01:59:20,790
- 杀 杀 杀 杀 - 杀 杀 杀 杀
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! - Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

1008
01:59:41,130 --> 01:59:43,270
- 杀 - 杀
- Kill! - Kill!

1009
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:23,350
仁慈的马西墨斯
Maximus the Merciful!

1010
02:00:32,430 --> 02:00:38,280
- 马西墨斯 马西墨斯 马西墨斯 - 马西墨斯 马西墨斯 马西墨斯
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! - Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1011
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:48,130
卫兵 前进 攻击队形
Forward, arms at ready!

1012
02:01:18,010 --> 02:01:20,490
我该拿你怎么办
What am I going to do with you?

1013
02:01:21,560 --> 02:01:25,120
为什么你 不去死
You simply won't die.

1014
02:01:29,780 --> 02:01:32,250
我们之间的差异真有这么大吗
Are we so different, you and I?

1015
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:36,300
必要时你也杀人 就像我一样
You take life when you have to, as I do.

1016
02:01:37,580 --> 02:01:41,340
只剩下一个人我非杀不可 然后我的责任就完成了
I have only one more life to take. Then it is done.

1017
02:01:41,790 --> 02:01:43,640
那现在就动手啊
Then take it now.

1018
02:01:56,590 --> 02:01:58,700
他们告诉我你儿子
They tell me your son

1019
02:01:59,390 --> 02:02:03,410
在被钉上十字架的时候 象女孩子一样在尖叫
squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross.

1020
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:07,200
还有你妻子
And your wife

1021
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:10,370
在被他们蹂躏的时候
moaned like a whore

1022
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:16,050
象妓女一样在呻吟
when they ravaged her again and again

1023
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:18,800
一次又一次 呻吟着
and again.

1024
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:27,810
你呼风唤雨的日子很快就要结束了
The time for honoring yourself will soon be at an end,

1025
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:33,770
陛下
Highness.

1026
02:03:01,200 --> 02:03:07,100
将军
General! General!

1027
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:10,930
- 将军 - 西斯洛
- General! - Cicero!

1028
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:19,890
- 将军 - 军队在哪里扎营
- General! - Where are you camped?

1029
02:03:19,890 --> 02:03:21,280
在奥斯亚
Ostia.

1030
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:30,690
- 我们爱你 马西墨斯 - 赞美胜利者
- We love you, Maximus! - Praise the victor!

1031
02:03:30,690 --> 02:03:33,290
告诉大家我还活着 来找我
Tell the men their general lives. Find me.

1032
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:35,250
- 快走 - 来找我
- Move along! - Find me!

1033
02:04:01,010 --> 02:04:03,070
他们可以听到你的祈祷吗
Can they hear you?

1034
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:10,160
- 谁 - 你在黄泉的家人
- Who? - Your family, in the afterlife.

1035
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:15,000
- 会的 - 你跟他们说什么
- Yes. - What do you say to them?

1036
02:04:18,780 --> 02:04:20,340
对我的儿子
To my boy,

1037
02:04:22,070 --> 02:04:24,700
我告诉他我们很快就能见面了
I tell him I will see him again soon,

1038
02:04:24,700 --> 02:04:28,390
骑马的时候记得脚跟要压低点
and to keep his heels down when he's riding his horse.

1039
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:31,180
对我妻子
To my wife,

1040
02:04:33,580 --> 02:04:35,810
那不关你的事
that is not your business.

1041
02:04:43,390 --> 02:04:46,360
现在观众反而敬爱马西墨斯的仁慈
And now they love Maximus for his mercy.

1042
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:51,280
因此我更不能杀他 不然就会显得我更残暴
So I can'tjust kill him, or it makes me even more unmerciful.

1043
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:56,870
这整件事简直就像场恶梦
The whole thing is like some great nightmare.

1044
02:04:58,030 --> 02:04:59,940
他是在公然向你挑战
He is defying you.

1045
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:03,410
他每一次的胜利都是种反抗的举动
His every victory is an act of defiance.

1046
02:05:03,410 --> 02:05:07,090
观众和元老院议员们都看到了
The mob sees this, and so do the Senate.

1047
02:05:07,790 --> 02:05:10,760
只要他存在一天 他们就会越来越大胆
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.

1048
02:05:12,210 --> 02:05:14,060
- 杀了他 - 不行
- Kill him. - No.

1049
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:18,400
我不会帮他成为烈士
I will not make a martyr of him.

1050
02:05:25,430 --> 02:05:27,970
我今天去国会
When I went to the Senate today,

1051
02:05:27,970 --> 02:05:32,530
特意告诉他们 我用了谷物贮备来支付竞技赛
I purposefully told them about using the grain reserves to pay for the games.

1052
02:05:34,350 --> 02:05:36,610
你记得发生什么事吗
And did you note what happened?

1053
02:05:36,610 --> 02:05:39,920
- 没什么 - 对 什么都没发生
- Nothing. - Exactly. Nothing.

1054
02:05:40,820 --> 02:05:43,240
一句抗议都没有
Not a single word of protest.

1055
02:05:43,240 --> 02:05:46,950
连傲慢的格瑞克斯议员也没出声
Even the insolent Senator Gracchus was silent as a mouse.

1056
02:05:46,950 --> 02:05:48,220
为什么
Why?

1057
02:05:49,830 --> 02:05:53,620
我听说有一种海蛇
I have been told of a certain sea snake

1058
02:05:53,620 --> 02:05:57,770
用非常特别的方法来诱捕猎物
which has a very unusual method of attracting its prey.

1059
02:05:58,130 --> 02:06:01,940
它会假装受伤 躺在海底
It will lie at the bottom of the ocean as ifwounded.

1060
02:06:02,020 --> 02:06:02,800
然后敌人接近

1061
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:05,220
接着它的敌人会渐渐的靠近
Then its enemies will approach,

1062
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:08,400
它会继续躺着不动
and yet it will lie quite still.

1063
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:12,520
接着敌人会开始慢慢的咬它
And then its enemies will take little bites of it,

1064
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:15,910
但它还是 一动不动
and yet it remains still.

1065
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:20,290
那么
So,

1066
02:06:21,530 --> 02:06:23,420
我们要不动声色
we will lie still,

1067
02:06:24,030 --> 02:06:27,460
耐心等待我们的敌人上钩
and let our enemies come to us and nibble.

1068
02:06:28,530 --> 02:06:30,880
让所有的议员也自投罗网
Have every senator followed.

1069
02:06:48,430 --> 02:06:50,260
西斯洛 我的老朋友
Cicero, my old friend.

1070
02:06:50,260 --> 02:06:52,220
我以为再也见不到你了
I thought perhaps I'd seen you for the last time.

1071
02:06:52,220 --> 02:06:54,850
- 我以为你死了 - 差不多
- I thought you were dead. - Close.

1072
02:06:54,850 --> 02:06:56,560
军团驻扎在奥斯亚有多久了
How long have the men been in Ostia?

1073
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:57,990
整个冬季
All winter.

1074
02:06:58,230 --> 02:07:01,620
- 他们的状况如何  - 整天吃饱了 无所事事
- And how do they look? - Fat and bored.

1075
02:07:02,230 --> 02:07:05,380
- 指挥官是谁 - 从罗马来的白痴
- Who's in command? - Some fool from Rome.

1076
02:07:06,900 --> 02:07:08,820
他们最快要什么时候才能准备好
How soon do you think they could be ready to fight?

1077
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:10,720
为了你 明天
For you, tomorrow.

1078
02:07:12,080 --> 02:07:14,680
有件事我需要你帮忙
I need you to do something for me.

1079
02:07:19,210 --> 02:07:20,710
各位 快来看
Come, see, witness.

1080
02:07:20,710 --> 02:07:23,840
如果你没去竞技场的话 你能在这里看见当时的情景
If you haven't been in the arena, you can see the show here.

1081
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:27,550
马西墨斯快要打败我们的皇帝康莫德斯了 我们该怎么办
Giant Maximus is defeating our emperor, Commodus.

1082
02:07:27,550 --> 02:07:30,260
他藐视每一个人
What are we to do? He's just defying everyone,

1083
02:07:30,260 --> 02:07:32,030
我们该怎么办
by doing this to him, they do...

1084
02:07:33,180 --> 02:07:34,610
啊 我的天啊
My goodness!

1085
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:39,990
- 他赢了 - 让路
- He got him, he's defeated. - Give way!

1086
02:07:45,990 --> 02:07:48,650
公主陛下 我在凡度巴纳侍奉过你父亲
My lady? I served your father at Vindobona.

1087
02:07:48,650 --> 02:07:50,280
- 退后 - 我的夫人
- Back. - My lady.

1088
02:07:50,280 --> 02:07:52,780
我在凡度巴纳服侍过你父亲
I served your father at Vindobona.

1089
02:07:52,780 --> 02:07:53,950
退后
Back!

1090
02:07:53,950 --> 02:07:57,260
我也服侍过马西墨斯将军 我现在还为他服务
And I served General Maximus. I serve him still.

1091
02:07:58,660 --> 02:08:00,350
停下来
Stop. Stop.

1092
02:08:00,790 --> 02:08:02,060
停
Stop!

1093
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:04,390
退下
Stand back.

1094
02:08:05,590 --> 02:08:08,730
将军让我带个口信 他愿意见你说的政治家
The general sends word, he will meet your politician.

1095
02:08:10,340 --> 02:08:13,740
- 士兵 奖赏你的忠诚 - 谢谢 夫人
- For your loyalty, soldier. - Thank you, my lady.

1096
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:24,830
出去吧
Leave us.

1097
02:08:30,450 --> 02:08:32,260
格瑞克斯议员
Senator Gracchus.

1098
02:08:45,960 --> 02:08:47,350
将军
General.

1099
02:08:48,340 --> 02:08:51,170
我希望今天我来这里能够
I hope my coming here today is evidence enough

1100
02:08:51,180 --> 02:08:54,360
使你信任我
that you can trust me.

1101
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:01,120
- 元老院和你的立场一致 - 元老院
- The Senate is with you? - The Senate?

1102
02:09:02,520 --> 02:09:05,330
是的 我能代表他们
Yes. I can speak for them.

1103
02:09:05,860 --> 02:09:09,290
你能帮我获得自由偷偷把我运出罗马吗
You can buy my freedom and smuggle me out of Rome?

1104
02:09:09,570 --> 02:09:11,130
你打算干什么
To what end?

1105
02:09:12,490 --> 02:09:14,920
把我送到城外去
Get me outside the city walls.

1106
02:09:15,410 --> 02:09:19,370
准备好马匹让我去奥斯亚 我的军队在那里扎营
Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia. My army is encamped there.

1107
02:09:19,370 --> 02:09:22,790
我会在第二天傍晚率领五千名士兵回来
By nightfall of the second day, I shall return at the head of 5, 000 men.

1108
02:09:22,790 --> 02:09:25,120
但军团的新指挥官
But the legions all have new commanders,

1109
02:09:25,130 --> 02:09:26,630
全都效忠于康莫德斯
loyal to Commodus.

1110
02:09:26,630 --> 02:09:29,880
只要我的部下看到我还活你就知道他们效忠谁了
Let my men see me alive, and you shall see where their loyalties lie.

1111
02:09:29,880 --> 02:09:31,650
简直太疯狂了
This is madness.

1112
02:09:32,220 --> 02:09:35,640
百年来罗马军队从未进入过首都
No Roman army has entered the capital in 100 years.

1113
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:37,970
我不愿意引狼入室
I will not trade one dictatorship for another!

1114
02:09:37,970 --> 02:09:41,620
议员 已经没时间商量权宜办法了
The time for half measures and talk is over, Senator.

1115
02:09:42,060 --> 02:09:45,240
在你光荣的政变之后又将如何
And after your glorious coup, what then?

1116
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:50,070
你会带着五千名士兵离开罗马
You'll take your 5, 000 warriors and leave?

1117
02:09:50,070 --> 02:09:51,710
我会离开
I will leave.

1118
02:09:52,110 --> 02:09:54,240
士兵们会留下来保护你们
The soldiers will stay for your protection,

1119
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:56,010
受元老院的指挥
under the command of the Senate.

1120
02:09:56,030 --> 02:09:57,300
换言之
So,

1121
02:09:57,530 --> 02:10:01,840
一旦罗马被你控制以后 你会将它交还给人民
once all of Rome is yours, you'll just give it back to the people?

1122
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:04,220
告诉我原因
Tell me why.

1123
02:10:10,250 --> 02:10:13,520
因为那是某人临死前最后的期望
Because that was the last wish of a dying man.

1124
02:10:16,470 --> 02:10:18,440
我会杀了康莫德斯
I will kill Commodus.

1125
02:10:20,260 --> 02:10:23,450
罗马的命运就交给你了
The fate of Rome I leave to you.

1126
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:27,500
马可・奥勒留信任你
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1127
02:10:29,230 --> 02:10:31,370
他的女儿信任你
His daughter trusts you.

1128
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:37,050
我也会信任你
I will trust you.

1129
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:39,510
但我们时间紧迫
But we have little time.

1130
02:10:39,950 --> 02:10:41,800
给我两天时间
Give me two days,

1131
02:10:42,490 --> 02:10:44,850
我会想办法使你获得自由
and I will buy your freedom.

1132
02:10:45,370 --> 02:10:46,810
而你
And you,

1133
02:10:48,250 --> 02:10:49,930
你千万要活下去
you stay alive,

1134
02:10:51,340 --> 02:10:53,100
否则我就死定了
or I'll be dead.

1135
02:10:54,970 --> 02:10:56,650
我们得走了
Now we must go.

1136
02:11:23,620 --> 02:11:27,290
他会在等你 站在斗兽场脚下
He'll be waiting for you. Stand at the foot of the colossus.

1137
02:11:27,290 --> 02:11:28,970
他会找到你
He'll find you.

1138
02:12:13,040 --> 02:12:14,600
不可能成功的
It won't work.

1139
02:12:15,460 --> 02:12:17,690
皇帝对一切都了如指掌
The Emperor knows too much.

1140
02:12:18,340 --> 02:12:19,440
对我来说
And as for me,

1141
02:12:21,680 --> 02:12:23,820
形势越来越危险了
it's becoming dangerous.

1142
02:12:25,010 --> 02:12:27,370
我回来后会酬谢你的
You'll be paid on my return.

1143
02:12:29,350 --> 02:12:31,240
我向你保证
I give you my word.

1144
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:34,580
保证 你不回来的话怎么办呢
Your word? What if you don't return?

1145
02:12:35,730 --> 02:12:38,780
你还记得信任别人的感觉吗 普罗西莫
Do you remember what it was to have trust, Proximo?

1146
02:12:38,780 --> 02:12:40,130
信任
Trust?

1147
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:46,130
有谁值得我信任
Who am I to trust?

1148
02:12:46,620 --> 02:12:49,890
- 我会杀死康莫德斯 - 对我有什么好处
- I will kill Commodus. - Why would I want that?

1149
02:12:50,580 --> 02:12:52,390
他给我带来财富
He makes me rich.

1150
02:12:57,420 --> 02:13:00,360
我知道你是个信守承诺的人 将军
I know that you are a man of your word, General.

1151
02:13:02,010 --> 02:13:04,690
我也知道你愿意为荣誉而死
I know that you would die for honor.

1152
02:13:05,930 --> 02:13:07,990
你愿意为罗马而牺牲
You would die for Rome.

1153
02:13:08,930 --> 02:13:12,140
愿意为祖先的名誉而死
You would die for the memory of your ancestors.

1154
02:13:12,140 --> 02:13:14,540
但我 换个角度说
But I, on the other hand,

1155
02:13:17,150 --> 02:13:19,080
我不过是个表演艺人
I'm an entertainer.

1156
02:13:22,490 --> 02:13:23,800
守卫
Guard!

1157
02:13:28,540 --> 02:13:31,220
他杀了还你自由的那个人
He killed the man who set you free.

1158
02:13:40,300 --> 02:13:42,230
大人 是禁卫军
Praetorians, master.

1159
02:13:48,310 --> 02:13:49,570
停
Halt!

1160
02:14:54,620 --> 02:14:56,510
你去哪里了
Where have you been?

1161
02:14:56,870 --> 02:14:58,560
我派人去找你
I sent for you.

1162
02:15:00,040 --> 02:15:01,810
弟弟 别疑神疑鬼了
Please, brother.

1163
02:15:07,470 --> 02:15:09,440
什么事让你烦心
What's troubling you?

1164
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:14,240
格瑞克斯是不是有了新爱人
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

1165
02:15:15,930 --> 02:15:17,540
我不知道
I don't know.

1166
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:21,660
我以为你见过他
I thought you'd seen him.

1167
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:25,000
他像伤寒一样影响着每个人
He infects everyone like a putrid fever.

1168
02:15:26,740 --> 02:15:30,050
为罗马着想 必须要牺牲元老院
For the health of Rome, the Senate must be bled.

1169
02:15:30,370 --> 02:15:32,510
他也不能幸免
And he will bleed, too.

1170
02:15:33,290 --> 02:15:34,760
时机成熟了
Very soon.

1171
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:37,930
不要选在今晚
But not tonight.

1172
02:15:52,850 --> 02:15:55,870
还记得父亲曾说过的话吗
Do you remember what our father said once?

1173
02:15:57,100 --> 02:15:58,870
"一场梦
"It's a dream,

1174
02:16:00,650 --> 02:16:02,660
生活就是
"a frightful dream,

1175
02:16:05,110 --> 02:16:06,540
一场噩梦"
"life is."

1176
02:16:09,150 --> 02:16:11,340
你觉得他说的对吗
Do you think that's true?

1177
02:16:11,990 --> 02:16:13,590
我不知道
I don't know.

1178
02:16:17,080 --> 02:16:18,720
我认为是真的
I think it is.

1179
02:16:21,380 --> 02:16:24,230
而我只能和你分享
And I have only you to share it with.

1180
02:17:01,710 --> 02:17:03,430
张开嘴
Open your mouth.

1181
02:17:40,620 --> 02:17:42,510
你知道我爱你
You know I love you.

1182
02:17:44,500 --> 02:17:46,180
我也爱你
And I love you.

1183
02:18:22,750 --> 02:18:24,390
出去 滚出去
Out. Get out!

1184
02:18:25,500 --> 02:18:26,850
快点
Move!

1185
02:18:31,420 --> 02:18:33,550
恭喜你 将军
Congratulations, General.

1186
02:18:33,550 --> 02:18:36,440
你的朋友很擅于说服别人
You've got very persuasive friends.

1187
02:18:42,350 --> 02:18:44,930
我弟弟已经逮捕了格瑞克斯
My brother has had Gracchus arrested.

1188
02:18:44,940 --> 02:18:48,480
我们不能再等下去了 今晚一定得离开
We daren't wait any longer. We must leave tonight.

1189
02:18:48,480 --> 02:18:52,210
普罗西莫半夜会来把你带到大门口
Proximo will come at midnight and take you to the gate.

1190
02:18:52,780 --> 02:18:56,550
你的仆人 西斯洛 会带着马在那边等你
Your servant, Cicero, will be waiting there with horses.

1191
02:18:58,450 --> 02:19:00,840
- 你一个人安排这一切的吗 - 是
- You have done all this? - Yes.

1192
02:19:01,950 --> 02:19:03,760
你太冒险了
You risk too much.

1193
02:19:04,620 --> 02:19:06,720
我有太多的债要还
I have much to pay for.

1194
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:11,340
你并没有亏欠任何人
You have nothing to pay for.

1195
02:19:11,340 --> 02:19:14,520
你爱你的儿子 为了他 你变得十分坚强
You love your son. You're strong for him.

1196
02:19:17,630 --> 02:19:20,070
我已经厌倦了
I am tired of being strong.

1197
02:19:21,930 --> 02:19:26,240
我弟弟憎恨全世界 尤其是你
My brother hates all the world, and you most of all.

1198
02:19:26,640 --> 02:19:29,870
- 因为你父亲选了我 - 不
- Because your father chose me. - No.

1199
02:19:31,060 --> 02:19:33,420
因为我父亲爱你
Because my father loved you.

1200
02:19:37,240 --> 02:19:39,760
而我也爱你
And because I loved you.

1201
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:44,010
很久以前的事了
A long time ago.

1202
02:19:48,670 --> 02:19:50,890
我变了很多吗
Was I very different then?

1203
02:19:57,340 --> 02:19:59,190
你以前比较爱笑
You laughed more.

1204
02:20:03,180 --> 02:20:05,700
我一直都觉得很寂寞
I have felt alone all my life,

1205
02:20:06,890 --> 02:20:08,660
除了跟你一起时
except with you.

1206
02:20:11,650 --> 02:20:13,120
我要走了
I must go.

1207
02:20:13,690 --> 02:20:14,920
是的
Yes.

1208
02:20:43,300 --> 02:20:44,610
那里
There.

1209
02:20:56,070 --> 02:20:57,670
我赢了
And I got you.

1210
02:21:00,610 --> 02:21:02,610
现在玩士兵打仗不会晚了点吗
Isn't it late to be playing legionnaire?

1211
02:21:02,610 --> 02:21:04,800
我不是士兵
I'm not a legionnaire.

1212
02:21:05,030 --> 02:21:07,720
- 不是士兵 - 我是角斗士
- Not a legionnaire? - I'm a gladiator.

1213
02:21:08,910 --> 02:21:10,470
角斗士
A gladiator?

1214
02:21:11,080 --> 02:21:13,830
角斗士只在竞技场里打斗
Gladiators only fight in the games.

1215
02:21:13,830 --> 02:21:17,340
难道你不想像凯撒朱利叶 那样当一名出色的罗马战士
Wouldrt you rather be a great Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?

1216
02:21:17,340 --> 02:21:20,020
我是马西墨斯 罗马的救世主
I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!

1217
02:21:22,760 --> 02:21:24,690
罗马的救世主
The savior of Rome?

1218
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:34,410
是谁说的
And who said that?

1219
02:21:43,150 --> 02:21:44,840
卢修斯在哪里
Where's Lucius?

1220
02:21:45,950 --> 02:21:48,470
他和皇帝在一起 夫人
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

1221
02:21:51,290 --> 02:21:53,080
- 她不可能那样做 - 不 是真的
- She couldn't. - Yes, she did.

1222
02:21:53,080 --> 02:21:55,390
她在篮中拿出来
She took it from a basket,

1223
02:21:56,710 --> 02:22:00,560
她从篮子里拿出来 把它放在胸口 就在她心脏的正上方
and pressed it to her breast, right here above her heart.

1224
02:22:02,090 --> 02:22:05,400
- 它咬在她的胸口上 - 是的
- It bit her in the breast? - Yes.

1225
02:22:05,970 --> 02:22:10,030
你知道吗 卢修斯 有时候那些皇室的小姐们
You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies

1226
02:22:10,430 --> 02:22:14,480
为了爱可以做出一些非常奇怪的事来
behave very strangely and do very odd things in the name of love.

1227
02:22:14,480 --> 02:22:17,160
- 我觉得这样做很愚蠢 - 我也这么想
- I think it's silly. - So do I.

1228
02:22:19,150 --> 02:22:20,580
我也这么想
So do I.

1229
02:22:21,030 --> 02:22:23,210
姐姐 过来加入我们
Sister, join us.

1230
02:22:23,740 --> 02:22:25,570
我在念故事给卢修斯听
I've been reading to dear Lucius.

1231
02:22:25,570 --> 02:22:27,660
- 我也在读 - 没错
- I've been reading, too. - Yes.

1232
02:22:27,660 --> 02:22:32,090
他是个非常机灵的小男孩 总有一天他会成为了不起的皇帝的
He's a very clever little boy. He'll make a grand emperor one day.

1233
02:22:33,540 --> 02:22:36,040
我们在读伟大的安东尼
We've been reading about the great Mark Antony,

1234
02:22:36,040 --> 02:22:37,460
和他在埃及的冒险
and his adventures in Egypt.

1235
02:22:37,460 --> 02:22:40,090
还有皇后用蛇自杀的故事
And the queen killed herself with a snake.

1236
02:22:40,090 --> 02:22:43,510
我还没告诉你发生在我们祖先身上的故事
And just wait until you hear what happened to our ancestors.

1237
02:22:43,510 --> 02:22:45,420
如果你很乖的话
If you're very good,

1238
02:22:45,430 --> 02:22:49,300
明晚我会给你讲克劳迪亚斯皇帝的故事
tomorrow night, I'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius.

1239
02:22:49,300 --> 02:22:51,110
他身边最亲近的人
He was betrayed

1240
02:22:52,220 --> 02:22:54,450
背叛了他
by those closest to him.

1241
02:22:56,230 --> 02:22:58,080
他的亲人
By his own blood.

1242
02:22:59,310 --> 02:23:01,860
他们在黑暗的角落里商议
They whispered in dark corners

1243
02:23:01,860 --> 02:23:04,400
并且在半夜偷偷出去
and went out late at night,

1244
02:23:04,400 --> 02:23:07,840
共同密谋
and conspired, and conspired.

1245
02:23:10,370 --> 02:23:14,300
但皇帝知道他们在策划阴谋
But the Emperor Claudius knew that they were up to something.

1246
02:23:14,330 --> 02:23:16,970
他知道他们像小蜜蜂一样忙碌
He knew they were busy little bees.

1247
02:23:18,830 --> 02:23:21,980
有天晚上 他和其中一人谈话
And one night he sat down with one of them,

1248
02:23:22,670 --> 02:23:24,770
他看着她
and he looked at her,

1249
02:23:25,420 --> 02:23:27,070
然后说
and he said,

1250
02:23:28,130 --> 02:23:30,820
"告诉我你们的计划
"Tell me what you've been doing,

1251
02:23:31,390 --> 02:23:33,200
忙碌的小蜜蜂
"busy little bee.

1252
02:23:35,390 --> 02:23:38,580
不然我会杀死你最亲的人
"Or I shall strike down those dearest to you.

1253
02:23:39,650 --> 02:23:42,790
你会看到我身上沾满他们的鲜血"
"You shall watch as I bathe in their blood."

1254
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:48,920
而皇帝的心都碎了
And the Emperor was heartbroken.

1255
02:23:50,910 --> 02:23:53,200
小蜜蜂对他的伤害
The little bee had wounded him more deeply

1256
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:56,010
比任何人都要深
than anyone else could ever have done.

1257
02:23:58,040 --> 02:24:01,020
卢修斯 你认为接下来会发生什么事
What do you think happened then, Lucius?

1258
02:24:01,540 --> 02:24:03,480
我不知道 舅舅
I don't know, Uncle.

1259
02:24:09,880 --> 02:24:12,570
小蜜蜂告诉了他所有的事
The little bee told him everything.

1260
02:25:10,360 --> 02:25:13,460
开闸 皇上有令
Open, in the name of the Emperor!

1261
02:25:14,200 --> 02:25:15,590
普罗西莫

1262
02:25:16,370 --> 02:25:19,590
开门 我们是奉皇帝的命令来的

奉皇帝的命令 开门
Open the gates!

1265
02:25:31,170 --> 02:25:33,570
快开门 普罗西莫
Open the gates, Proximo.

1266
02:25:33,930 --> 02:25:36,280
老头 你想找死吗
Do you want to die, old man?

1267
02:25:37,390 --> 02:25:38,610
拿去
Here.

1268
02:25:39,100 --> 02:25:41,350
一切准备好了
Everything is prepared.

1269
02:25:41,350 --> 02:25:43,890
看来你赢得你的自由了
It seems you have won your freedom.

1270
02:25:43,900 --> 02:25:47,580
普罗西莫 当个好人是否会替你惹上麻烦
Proximo, are you in danger of becoming a good man?

1271
02:25:52,570 --> 02:25:56,510
- 裘巴 - 反抗皇帝的人都得死
- Juba. - All enemies of the Emperor die!

1272
02:25:56,950 --> 02:25:59,220
开门 皇帝的命令
Open the gates!

1273
02:26:04,620 --> 02:26:06,680
用力拉
Pull!

1274
02:26:08,710 --> 02:26:11,690
冲 两队人去左边
Move! Form a column on the left!

1275
02:26:15,390 --> 02:26:18,680
我只需要机会脱身 千万别做无谓的牺牲
I only need moments, so do not be careless with your lives.

1276
02:26:18,680 --> 02:26:21,220
不想被卷入这事的 就回到囚室里去
If you don't want any part of this, go back to your cells.

1277
02:26:21,220 --> 02:26:23,560
我们会留在这里帮你 马西墨斯
We'll wait here for you, Maximus.

1278
02:26:23,560 --> 02:26:25,440
- 勇气和荣誉 - 勇气和荣誉
- Strength and honor. - Strength and honor.

1279
02:26:25,440 --> 02:26:26,580
去吧

02:26:31,820 --> 02:26:34,750
瞄准 拉弓

1282
02:27:25,670 --> 02:27:27,290
马可・奥勒留914-922

1283
02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:31,400
普罗西莫

1284
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:43,160
一切终归尘土
Shadows and dust.

1285
02:28:24,970 --> 02:28:26,320
马西墨斯
Maximus!

1286
02:28:31,690 --> 02:28:33,210
对不起
I'm sorry.

1287
02:28:59,510 --> 02:29:00,980
事情都解决了
It's done.

1288
02:29:07,850 --> 02:29:09,820
该如何处治我的外甥
And what of my nephew?

1289
02:29:10,810 --> 02:29:12,910
还有他的母亲
And what of his mother?

1290
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:17,540
他们应该面对和她爱人相同的命运吗
Should they share her lover's fate?

1291
02:29:19,150 --> 02:29:21,290
还是我应该网开一面
Or should I be merciful?

1292
02:29:23,910 --> 02:29:25,920
仁慈的康莫德斯
Commodus the Merciful.

1293
02:29:32,250 --> 02:29:34,680
从现在起 卢修斯由我照顾
Lucius will stay with me now.

1294
02:29:35,750 --> 02:29:37,640
如果他母亲
And if his mother

1295
02:29:38,920 --> 02:29:41,150
用令我不快的眼神看着我
so much as looks at me

1296
02:29:42,220 --> 02:29:44,820
用令我不快的态度对我
in a manner that displeases me,

1297
02:29:46,680 --> 02:29:48,200
他就会死
he will die.

1298
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:54,950
如果她想 抵死不从
If she decides to be noble,

1299
02:29:56,610 --> 02:29:58,790
或者想自杀的话
and takes her own life,

1300
02:30:00,280 --> 02:30:01,840
他会死
he will die.

1301
02:30:05,360 --> 02:30:07,170
至于你
And as for you,

1302
02:30:09,870 --> 02:30:11,720
你会爱我
you will love me,

1303
02:30:12,460 --> 02:30:14,350
就像我爱你一样
as I have loved you.

1304
02:30:15,830 --> 02:30:19,600
你会帮我生育下一代 血统纯正的继承人
You will provide me with an heir of pure blood,

1305
02:30:20,460 --> 02:30:22,400
那么康莫德斯
so that Commodus

1306
02:30:22,880 --> 02:30:25,940
和他的子孙 将世世代代统治罗马
and his progeny will rule for 1, 000 years.

1307
02:30:30,470 --> 02:30:32,320
我不够仁慈吗
Am I not merciful?

1308
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:56,810
我不够仁慈吗
Am I not merciful!

1309
02:31:08,930 --> 02:31:13,030
- 马西墨斯 马西墨斯 马西墨斯 - 马西墨斯 马西墨斯 马西墨斯
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! - Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1310
02:31:40,380 --> 02:31:43,230
我是军人 我职责是服从
I'm a soldier. I obey.

1311
02:31:45,880 --> 02:31:50,240
没人可以逼你做你不愿意的事
Nothing happens to anyone that he is not fitted by nature to bear.

1312
02:32:23,090 --> 02:32:29,150
马西墨斯
Maximus.

1313
02:32:30,760 --> 02:32:32,690
他们在为你欢呼
They call for you.

1314
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:37,910
一个沦为奴隶的将军
The general who became a slave.

1315
02:32:39,060 --> 02:32:41,540
一个变成角斗士的奴隶
The slave who became a gladiator.

1316
02:32:42,810 --> 02:32:45,710
一个挑战皇帝的角斗士
The gladiator who defied an emperor.

1317
02:32:47,610 --> 02:32:49,380
一个震撼人心的故事
A striking story.

1318
02:32:50,450 --> 02:32:53,760
现在人们想知道故事的结局
Now the people want to know how the story ends.

1319
02:32:56,040 --> 02:32:58,390
只有一个出名的死亡才能令人满意
Only a famous death will do.

1320
02:33:00,210 --> 02:33:02,850
还有什么能比
And what could be more glorious

1321
02:33:03,130 --> 02:33:06,980
在竞技场上亲自挑战皇帝来的光荣呢
than to challenge the Emperor himself in the great arena?

1322
02:33:09,220 --> 02:33:12,360
- 你要和我决斗 - 为什么不
- You would fight me? - Why not?

1323
02:33:13,340 --> 02:33:15,490
你以为我害怕吗
Do you think I'm afraid?

1324
02:33:16,310 --> 02:33:19,430
我认为你一生人也在害怕
I think you have been afraid all your life.

1325
02:33:19,430 --> 02:33:23,240
不像无敌的马西墨斯 有谁从来不害怕
Unlike Maximus the Invincible, who knows no fear?

1326
02:33:28,900 --> 02:33:32,380
一个我认识的人曾经说过 "死亡向所有人微笑
I knew a man who once said, "Death smiles at us all.

1327
02:33:33,160 --> 02:33:35,760
人们所能做的就是还以微笑"
"All a man can do is smile back."

1328
02:33:37,450 --> 02:33:38,970
我在怀疑
I wonder,

1329
02:33:39,500 --> 02:33:42,390
你的朋友在面对死亡时也在微笑吗
did your friend smile at his own death?

1330
02:33:42,670 --> 02:33:44,270
你要知道
You must know.

1331
02:33:47,090 --> 02:33:48,980
他是你父亲
He was your father.

1332
02:33:52,760 --> 02:33:55,190
我知道 你爱我的父亲
You loved my father, I know,

1333
02:33:56,600 --> 02:33:58,200
但我也爱他
but so did I.

1334
02:33:59,720 --> 02:34:02,410
我们因此是兄弟 不是吗
That makes us brothers, doesn't it?

1335
02:34:04,940 --> 02:34:06,620
兄弟 对我微笑吧
Smile for me now, brother.

1336
02:34:12,530 --> 02:34:15,460
替他穿上盔甲 把伤口遮住
Strap on his armor. Conceal the wound.

1337
02:35:09,790 --> 02:35:11,850
成包围队形
Ring formation!

1338
02:37:03,530 --> 02:37:05,260
昆塔斯 剑
Quintus, sword.

1339
02:37:06,660 --> 02:37:08,550
把你的剑给我
Give me your sword.

1340
02:37:11,870 --> 02:37:13,980
剑 给我把剑
Sword! Give me a sword!

1341
02:37:15,380 --> 02:37:18,980
收剑入鞘 收剑入鞘
Sheathe your swords. Sheathe your swords!

1342
02:39:34,350 --> 02:39:36,960
马西墨斯
Maximus.

1343
02:39:42,940 --> 02:39:44,380
昆塔斯
Quintus.

1344
02:39:45,940 --> 02:39:47,500
还我的人自由
Free my men.

1345
02:39:48,780 --> 02:39:51,590
恢复格瑞克斯议员的职位
Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated.

1346
02:39:52,790 --> 02:39:54,970
罗马的共和是个梦想
There was a dream that was Rome.

1347
02:39:55,540 --> 02:39:57,510
它应当被实现
It shall be realized.

1348
02:39:57,960 --> 02:40:00,640
这些都是马可・奥勒留的心愿
These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius.

1349
02:40:01,630 --> 02:40:03,730
释放囚犯 快去
Free the prisoners. Go!

1350
02:40:28,400 --> 02:40:29,840
马西墨斯
Maximus.

1351
02:40:31,620 --> 02:40:33,300
卢修斯安全了
Lucius is safe.

1352
02:40:49,510 --> 02:40:51,030
去找他们吧
Go to them.

1353
02:41:40,730 --> 02:41:42,240
你回到家了
You're home.

1354
02:42:08,800 --> 02:42:11,440
罗马值得一个好人牺牲性命吗
Is Rome won'th one good mars life?

1355
02:42:15,220 --> 02:42:17,110
我们曾经相信
We believed it once.

1356
02:42:20,220 --> 02:42:22,450
那就让我们再次相信吧
Make us believe it again.

1357
02:42:25,850 --> 02:42:28,040
他是罗马的将士
He was a soldier of Rome.

1358
02:42:31,780 --> 02:42:33,290
让我们给他荣耀
Honor him.

1359
02:42:33,650 --> 02:42:35,920
谁愿意来帮我一起抬他
Who will help me carry him?

1360
02:43:20,580 --> 02:43:22,340
现在我们都自由了
Now we are free.

1361
02:43:28,630 --> 02:43:30,600
我们会再见面的
I will see you again.

1362
02:43:33,380 --> 02:43:34,940
不过现在还不是时候
But not yet.

1363
02:43:35,840 --> 02:43:39,250
还不是时候
Not yet.
