1
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,990
羅馬帝國在全盛時期的版圖

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,360
由非洲沙漠延伸至

3
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,070
英格蘭北部邊境

4
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,270
羅馬皇帝更掌控了全世界

5
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,470
三分之一以上人口的生殺大權

6
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,370
在西元180年的冬天 馬可·奧勒留皇帝(著名的哲學皇帝)

7
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,750
12年征戰討伐日耳曼野蠻部落的行動

8
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,220
即將宣告結束

9
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,550
只要掃平最後一處據點 羅馬大軍便可獲得勝利

10
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,050
而帝國從此可以永享太平

11
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,750
日耳曼尼亞(今德國境內)

12
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,430
長官
Sir.

13
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,780
將軍
General.

14
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,790
長官
Sir.

15
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,470
士兵們又累又餓
Lean and hungry.

16
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,340
- 還沒有動靜嗎? - 完全沒有
- Still nothing? - Not a sign.

17
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,320
- 他去了多久? - 將近兩小時了
- How long has he been gone? - Nearly two hours.

18
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,050
他們會開戰嗎? 長官?
Will they fight, sir?

19
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,640
我們很快就會知道了
We shall know soon enough.

20
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,270
士兵 把投石車往前挪點
Soldier, I ordered you to move those catapults forward.

21
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,660
- 射程不夠遠 - 射程沒問題
- They're out of range. - Range is good.

22
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,790
- 可能會誤傷輕騎兵的... - 不用擔心 同意吧?
- The danger to the cavalry... - Is acceptable. Agreed?

23
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,550
他們拒絕投降
They say no.

24
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,040
他們應該認命了 他們已被征服了
People should know when they're conquered.

25
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,300
你會嗎 昆塔斯?
Would you, Quintus?

26
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,510
我會嗎?
Would I?

27
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,950
- 勇氣與榮耀 - 勇氣與榮耀
- Strength and honor. - Strength and honor.

28
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,750
收到我的信號後就發動攻擊
At my signal, unleash hell.

29
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,980
投石車準備
Load the catapults.

30
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,820
步兵組成進攻隊形
Infantry form up for advance.

31
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,680
- 弓箭手準備 - 弓箭手!
- Archers ready. - Archers!

32
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,280
- 搭箭! - 搭箭!
- Nock! - Nock!

33
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,410
弟兄們!
Fratres!

34
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,350
- 馬西墨斯! - 馬西墨斯!
- Maximus! - Maximus!

35
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,880
三星期後 我將在田里收割莊稼
Three weeks from now, I will be harvesting my crops.

36
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,440
想像下你要去的地方 願望就要實現了
Imagine where you will be, and it will be so.

37
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,470
保持隊形 跟我衝啊
Hold the line! Stay with me!

38
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,220
如果你發現自己落單了
If you find yourself alone,

39
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,330
迎著陽光 獨自馳騁在草原上時
riding in green fields with the sun on your face,

40
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,700
不用迷惑
do not be troubled.

41
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,170
那是因為你已在天堂了 你已經陣亡了
For you are in Elysium, and you're already dead!

42
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,000
兄弟們...
Brothers,

43
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,220
我們生平的事跡
what we do in life

44
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,930
將永遠流傳
echoes in eternity.

45
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,730
拉!
Pull!

46
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,370
投石車準備就緒 長官!
Cohorts ready, sir!

47
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,380
弓箭手 點火!
Archers, ignite!

48
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,260
- 點火! - 點火!
- Ignite! - Ignite!

49
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,810
弓箭手 拉滿弓!
Archers, draw!

50
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,650
射!
Loose!

51
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,770
好了 大家開始進攻
All right, men, ready!

52
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,560
保持隊形
Hold the line!

53
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,930
射!
Loose!

54
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,490
填裝彈藥!
Reload!

55
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,530
保持隊形!
Hold the line!

56
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,960
- 拉弓! - 射!
- Draw! - Loose!

57
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:17,490
跟著我沖!
Stay with me!

58
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,000
羅馬必勝!
Roma victor!

59
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,070
普利托裡亞十四

60
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,040
你認為他真的快死了嗎?
Do you think he's really dying?

61
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,460
十年來 他一直過都是這樣子
He's been dying for 10 years.

62
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,940
如果他不是快不行了 就不會派人來召見我們了
If he werert really dying, he wouldn't have sent for us.

63
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,820
也許他只是想念我們呢
Maybe he just misses us.

64
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,490
那元老會的議員們呢? 沒事他不會傳喚他們的 除非
And the senators? He wouldn't have summoned them if...

65
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,870
安靜點 康莫德斯
Peace, Commodus.

66
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,240
在路上兩星期裡
After two weeks on the road,

67
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,010
你老是疑神疑鬼的 煩死我了
your incessant scheming is hurting my head.

68
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,860
他已作了決定 他將會宣佈
He's made his decision. He's going to announce it.

69
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,400
傳位給我
He will name me.

70
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,910
我將要做的第一件事...
The first thing I shall do when...

71
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,980
就是舉行大型的競技比賽來榮耀他
Is honor him with games won'thy of His Majesty.

72
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,920
現在 我最想做的第一件事 就是淋個熱水浴
For now, the first thing I shall do is have a hot bath.

73
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,420
殿下?
Your Highness?

74
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,220
看來我們就快到了
We seem to be almost there, sir.

75
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,590
- 殿下 - 皇帝在哪裡?
- Sire. - Where's the Emperor?

76
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:25,340
殿下 他在前線 已經去了19天了
He's at the front, sire. They've been gone for 19 days.

77
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,640
傷員還在不斷的運回來
The wounded are still coming in.

78
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,350
備馬
My horse.

79
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,120
殿下
My lord.

80
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,740
給我一個吻?
Kiss?

81
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,200
你再次證明了你的勇猛 馬西墨斯
You have proved your valor yet again, Maximus.

82
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,080
希望這是最後一次了
Let us hope, for the last time.

83
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,730
我們已經沒有敵人了 陛下
There's no one left to fight, sire.

84
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,490
永遠不能掉以輕心 敵人無處不在
There is always someone left to fight.

85
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,510
我該怎樣獎賞羅馬最偉大的將軍呢?
How can I reward Rome's greatest general?

86
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,510
恩准我回家
Let me go home.

87
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,310
家
Home.

88
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,650
凱撒 他們向你致敬
They honor you, Caesar.

89
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,540
是向你致敬 馬西墨斯 他們尊敬你
It's for you, Maximus. They honor you.

90
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,230
我錯過了這次的戰役了嗎?
Have I missed it? Have I missed the battle?

91
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,680
你錯過了整場戰爭
You have missed the war.

92
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,990
父親 恭喜你
Father, congratulations.

93
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,850
我會獻上100頭公牛來慶祝你的勝利
I shall sacrifice 100 bulls to honor your triumph.

94
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,600
那到不必
Save the bulls.

95
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,160
向馬西墨斯致敬吧 是他打贏了這場戰役
Honor Maximus. He won the battle.

96
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,910
- 將軍 - 陛下
- General. - Highness.

97
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,490
羅馬向你致敬 而我以兄弟的身份擁抱你
Rome salutes you, and I embrace you as a brother.

98
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,360
很久沒見了 老朋友
It has been too long, my old friend.

99
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,910
陛下
Highness.

100
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,590
來 父親 讓我來扶你
Here, Father. Take my arm.

101
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,390
我想我是時候離開了
I think it is time for me to leave.

102
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:17,870
這就是羅馬的榮耀
So much for the glory of Rome.

103
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,710
宏偉的戰役
Magnificent battle.

104
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,340
將軍 還活著?
General. Still alive?

105
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,720
還活著
Still alive.

106
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,430
天上的諸神也有幽默感的
The gods must have a sense of humor.

107
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,180
- 他們一定特別照顧你 - 維勒瑞斯
- The gods must love you. - Valerius.

108
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,140
將軍 你是要回軍營呢? 還是回羅馬?
Back to barracks, General? Or to Rome?

109
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,330
回家 我妻子孩子還有莊稼都在等著我
Home. My wife, my son, the harvest.

110
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,270
農夫馬西墨斯 我還是無法想像你當農夫的樣子
Maximus the farmer. I still have difficulty imagining that.

111
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,980
你知道的 泥垢要比血跡容易洗掉 昆塔斯
You know, dirt cleans off a lot easier than blood, Quintus.

112
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,150
- 他在這裡 - 陛下
- Here he is. - Highness.

113
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,410
議員蓋爾斯 議員佛克
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

114
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,370
當心蓋爾斯 他會替你洗腦
Beware of Gaius. He'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear,

115
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,040
接著某天你醒來 就只會高喊"共和萬歲 共和萬歲"
and you'll wake up one day and all you'll say is, "Republic, republic, republic."

116
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,790
有何不可? 畢竟羅馬創建時是共和制的
Well, why not? Rome was founded as a republic.

117
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,750
在共和制下 共和國是由元老會來執政的
Yes, and in a republic the senate has the power.

118
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,050
當然 議員蓋爾斯絕不是因此才從政的
But Senator Gaius isn't influenced by that, of course.

119
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:56,130
你支持誰呢? 將軍? 皇帝還是元老院?
Where do you stand, General? Emperor or Senate?

120
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,470
軍人的職責就是
A soldier has the advantage

121
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,970
保家衛國上陣殺敵 議員
of being able to look his enemy in the eye, Senator.

122
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:05,060
有軍隊支持 你要從政易如反掌
Well, with an army behind you, you could be extremely political.

123
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,290
我警告了你 二位 失陪一下
I warned you. Now I shall save you. Senators.

124
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,550
馬西墨斯
Maximus.

125
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,130
我將會需要你的幫助
I'm going to need good men like you.

126
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,790
有什麼我可以效勞的 殿下?
How may I be of service, Highness?

127
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,920
只有你才知道該如何指揮軍隊
You're a man who knows what it is to command.

128
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,340
在你的領導下 無人不服 戰無不勝
You give your orders, the orders are obeyed, and the battle is won.

129
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,230
但那些議員們只會爭吵算計阿諛奉承還有欺騙
But these senators scheme, squabble and flatter and deceive.

130
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,760
馬西墨斯 我們必須從政客們的手中拯救羅馬
Maximus, we must save Rome from the politicians, my friend.

131
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,990
到時候我能期待你的幫助嗎?
Can I count on you when the time comes?

132
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,730
殿下 只要你父親恩准我離開 我打算立刻回家去
Highness, when your father releases me, I intend to return home.

133
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,000
回家? 你是應該回家看看
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.

134
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,340
可別耽於安逸 也許我很快就會需要你的
Don't get too comfortable. I may call on you before long.

135
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,010
露西拉來了 你知道嗎?
Lucilla's here. Did you know?

136
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,430
她還沒有忘記你
She's not forgotten you.

137
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,060
而現在 你是個英雄了
And now, you're the great man.

138
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,870
如果你生為男人的話
If only you had been born a man,

139
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,200
你會成為一位偉大的凱撒
what a Caesar you would have made.

140
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,330
父親
Father.

141
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,320
你會很強壯
You would have been strong.

142
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,680
我想知道 你會很公正嗎?
I wonder, would you have been just?

143
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,100
我不會辜負你對我的教導和期望
I would have been what you taught me to be.

144
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,620
旅途怎樣?
How was yourjourney?

145
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:57,480
漫長 不舒服 為什麼要我來?
Long. Uncomfortable. Why have I come?

146
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,650
我需要你的幫忙 和你弟弟有關
I need your help. With your brother.

147
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,760
當然
Of course.

148
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,990
他愛你 他一向都很愛你
He loves you. He always has.

149
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,240
另外
And

150
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,280
他現在比往常更需要你
he will need you now, more than ever.

151
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,250
不談政治了
Enough of politics.

152
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,460
我們何不假裝你是一個可愛的女兒
Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter,

153
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,420
而我則是個好父親
and I am a good father.

154
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,720
令人愉快的假設 不是嗎?
This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?

155
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,200
早上好
Good morning to you.

156
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,880
再給我三匹馬
I need three more horses.

157
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:15,930
一! 二! 三!
One! Two! Three!

158
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,920
四!
Four!

159
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,270
一! 二!
One! Two!

160
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,410
你召見我嗎 凱撒?
You sent for me, Caesar?

161
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:46,040
- 凱撒? - 再告訴我一遍 馬西墨斯
- Caesar? - Tell me again, Maximus.

162
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,840
我們為什麼會在這裡?
Why are we here?

163
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,680
為了羅馬的榮耀 陛下
For the glory of the empire, sire.

164
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,180
沒錯
Yes.

165
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,180
對 我記起來了
Yes, I remember.

166
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,520
看到那地圖了嗎 馬西墨斯?
Do you see that map, Maximus?

167
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,860
那就是我所創建的世界
That is the world which I created.

168
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,360
25年來...
For 25 years,

169
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,780
我四處征戰 半生戎馬 才有今天的局面
I have conquered, spilt blood, expanded the empire.

170
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,940
自從我成為凱撒後 據我所知只有四年沒有戰爭
Since I became Caesar, I've known four years without war.

171
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,540
在20年裡 只有四年的和平
Four years of peace in 20.

172
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,330
這一切究竟是為了什麼?
And for what?

173
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,550
我只給大家帶來了戰爭 僅此而已
I brought the sword. Nothing more.

174
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,120
凱撒 你的一生...
Caesar, your life...

175
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,810
求你 不要那麼叫我了
Please. Please don't call me that.

176
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,350
過來
Come. Please.

177
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,520
過來坐下
Come sit.

178
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,060
讓我們好好談談
Let us talk together now,

179
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,070
純粹是男人之間的閒聊
very simply, as men.

180
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,570
說吧 馬西墨斯
Well, Maximus,

181
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,120
說吧
talk.

182
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,060
我有5000個人在外面的泥漿中挨凍
Five thousand of my men are out there in the freezing mud.

183
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,940
其中3000人渾身是傷
Three thousand of them are bloodied and cleaved.

184
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,480
另外有2000人再也無法離開這裡 他們都已經死了
Two thousand will never leave this place.

185
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,780
我絕不相信他們的犧牲毫無意義
I will not believe that they fought and died for nothing.

186
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,490
那你相信什麼 馬西墨斯?
And what would you believe?

187
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:15,410
他們為了你和羅馬而戰
They fought for you and for Rome.

188
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,300
羅馬是什麼 馬西墨斯?
And what is Rome, Maximus?

189
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,870
我到過世界上別的許多地方
I've seen much of the rest of the world.

190
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:25,960
那裡既冷酷又陰暗 羅馬象徵著光明
It is brutal and cruel and dark. Rome is the light.

191
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,960
但你從沒去過那裡
Yet you have never been there.

192
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,510
你沒看見羅馬已經變成什麼樣了
You have not seen what it has become.

193
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,650
我快要死了 馬西墨斯
I am dying, Maximus.

194
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,550
當一個快死的時候
When a man sees his end,

195
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,700
他會想知道自己的一生是否有價值
he wants to know there was some purpose to his life.

196
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,980
人們將來會怎麼評價我呢?
How will the world speak my name in years to come?

197
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,360
會推崇我是個哲學家?
Will I be known as the philosopher?

198
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,960
一名勇士?
The warrior?

199
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,670
還是位暴君?
The tyrant?

200
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:54,800
或是讓羅馬回歸自我的皇帝?
Or will I be the Emperor who gave Rome back her true self?

201
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,200
恢復共和制的羅馬是個夢想
There was once a dream that was Rome.

202
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,040
你只能悄悄地說
You could only whisper it.

203
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,210
再大聲一點的話 它將會消失
Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish,

204
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,140
它是如此的脆弱
it was so fragile.

205
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,150
我擔心在殘酷的現實環境中 他根本無法存活下去
And I fear that it will not survive the winter.

206
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,150
馬西墨斯
Maximus,

207
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,990
讓我們說點悄悄話
let us whisper now,

208
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,950
只有我和你
together, you and I.

209
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,160
你有個兒子
You have a son.

210
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,540
說說你講你的家庭
Tell me about your home.

211
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,670
我家在提基洛附近的山丘上
My house is in the hills above Trujillo.

212
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,800
一個非常簡單的地方
A very simple place.

213
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,120
在陽光下的暖和的紅磚屋
Pink stones that warm in the sun.

214
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,720
白天 菜園裡飄著藥草的香味
A kitchen garden that smells of herbs in the day,

215
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,390
到了晚上則是茉莉花的味道
jasmine in the evening.

216
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,650
門外有一棵高大的白楊樹
Through the gate is a giant poplar.

217
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,760
無花果樹 蘋果樹和梨樹
Figs, apples, pears.

218
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,690
土壤是黑色的 比我妻子的頭髮還黑
The soil, Marcus, black. Black like my wife's hair.

219
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,890
南坡上種葡萄 北坡種著橄欖
Grapes on the south slopes, olives on the north.

220
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,220
野生的小馬在我家附近玩耍 他們常逗我的兒子玩
Wild ponies play near my house. They tease my son.

221
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,940
他也想變成一匹小馬
He wants to be one of them.

222
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,810
你上一次回家是什麼時候?
When was the last time you were home?

223
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:10,040
2年又264天 還要算上今天早上
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

224
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:14,960
我羨慕你 馬西墨斯 你有個幸福的家庭
I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home.

225
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,380
值得你為它如此奮鬥
Worth fighting for

226
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,340
在你回家之前
There is one more duty

227
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,640
我希望你幫我做最後一件事
that I ask of you before you go home.

228
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,670
你要我做什麼 凱撒?
What would you have me do, Caesar?

229
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:34,400
我要你在我死後成為羅馬的保護者
I want you to become the protector of Rome after I die.

230
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,570
我會把政權交給你
I will empower you to one end alone,

231
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:42,570
將權力還給羅馬的人民
to give power back to the people of Rome,

232
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,990
結束危害羅馬的貪污腐敗
and end the corruption that has crippled it.

233
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:55,920
你願意接受這光榮的使命嗎?
Will you accept this great honor that I have offered you?

234
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,210
我打心眼裡...不願意
With all my heart, no.

235
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,510
馬西墨斯
Maximus,

236
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
這就是我一定要授權給你的原因
that is why it must be you.

237
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,170
但這應該是行政官或者議員的職責
But surely a prefect, a senator,

238
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,960
一個瞭解羅馬 熟悉政治的人
somebody who knows the city, who understands her politics.

239
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,020
但你還沒被羅馬的政治腐蝕
But you have not been corrupted by her politics.

240
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,660
- 康莫德斯呢? - 康莫德斯不是正人君子
- And Commodus? - Commodus is not a moral man.

241
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,230
你比誰都要清楚這一點
You have known that since you were young.

242
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,270
康莫德斯不能統治羅馬
Commodus cannot rule.

243
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,750
絕對不可以
He must not rule.

244
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,080
我要是有你這樣的兒子就好了
You are the son that I should have had.

245
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,630
康莫德斯會接受我的決定的
Commodus will accept my decision.

246
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:48,680
他知道軍隊只對你效忠
He knows that you command the loyalty of the army.

247
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,130
我需要時間考慮
I need some time, sire.

248
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,670
好吧
Yes.

249
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:00,320
我希望在日落之前你能答應我的請求
By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.

250
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,570
現在 象兒子般擁抱我吧
Now embrace me as my son.

251
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,700
順便再幫我拿條毯子來
And bring an old man another blanket.

252
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,430
- 我父親現在只寵愛你 - 夫人
- My father favors you now. - My lady.

253
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:32,020
- 以前不是這樣 - 很多東西都改變了
- It was not always so. - Many things change.

254
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:35,520
話是沒錯 但不是所有的事情
Many things. Not everything.

255
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,060
馬西墨斯 站住
Maximus, stop.

256
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,530
讓我看看你的臉
Let me see your face.

257
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,780
- 你看起來很沮喪 - 我失去了很多部下
- You seem upset. - I lost many men.

258
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,040
我父親找你有什麼事?
What did my father want with you?

259
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,080
在我回家前祝我一路順風
To wish me well before I leave for home.

260
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,210
你在撒謊
You're lying.

261
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,860
我總能看穿你在撒謊 因為你不精於此道
I could always tell when you were lying, because you were never any good at it.

262
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,450
我一直都不習慣你的安慰
I never acquired your comfort with it.

263
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,570
沒錯
True.

264
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,760
反正你也不需要
But then you never had to.

265
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,970
對軍人來說 生活要簡單的多
Life is more simple for a soldier.

266
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,980
或許你覺得我很無情?
Or do you think me heartless?

267
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,730
我覺得你具備生存的天分
I think you have a talent for survival.

268
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,280
馬西墨斯 停下
Maximus, stop.

269
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,350
再次見到我真的這麼可怕嗎?
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?

270
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,950
不 我只是厭倦了戰爭
No. I'm tired from battle.

271
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,370
看到我父親是那麼脆弱 你很心痛
It hurts you to see my father so fragile.

272
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,920
康莫德斯期望父親會很快宣佈他是斷任者
Commodus expects that my father will announce his succession within days.

273
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:50,470
你會像追隨我父親那樣對我弟弟效忠嗎?
Will you serve my brother as you served his father?

274
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,810
我會永遠對羅馬效忠
I will always serve Rome.

275
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,500
你知道嗎
Do you know,

我還是不忘替你祈禱

277
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:05,070
是的 我有祈禱
Oh, yes. I pray.

278
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,950
聽到你丈夫去世的消息我很難過 我替他追悼
I was sad to hear of your husband's death. I mourned him.

279
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,660
- 謝謝你 - 我聽說你有個兒子
- Thank you. - And I hear you have a son.

280
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,750

281
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,320
他快八歲了
He'll be nearly eight years old.

282
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,670
我兒子也快八歲

283
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,640
謝謝你的祈禱
I thank you for your prayers.

284
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,940
祖先們 我祈求你們指引我
Ancestors, I ask for your guidance.

285
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,820
天上的母親 求你指示我未來的方向
Blessed Mother, come to me with the gods' desire for my future.

286
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:53,240
天上的父親 求您保佑我的妻兒
Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son with a ready sword.

287
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,330
請轉告他們 我只是為再次擁抱他們而活
Whisper to them, I live only to hold them again.

288
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,660
祖先們 我榮耀你們
Ancestors, I honor you,

289
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:05,130
並將謹遵祖訓 有尊嚴的活下去
and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me.

290
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,230
西斯洛
Cicero.

291
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,950
主人
Sir.

292
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,950
我不覺得履行義務很困難嗎?
Do you ever find it hard to do your duty?

293
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:47,250
有時我做我想做事
Sometimes I do what I want to do.

294
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,550
其餘的時間我做我應該做的事
The rest of the time, I do what I have to.

295
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,430
也許我們還是不能回家去
We may not be able to go home, after all.

296
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,360
你準備好對羅馬履行你的職責了嗎?
Are you ready to do your duty for Rome?

297
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,940
是的 父親
Yes, Father.

298
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,110
你不會成為皇帝
You will not be emperor.

299
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,770
哪位年長的智者會取代我的地位?
Which wiser, older man is to take my place?

300
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:06,410
我會將政權移交給馬西墨斯
My powers will pass to Maximus,

301
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,360
直到確認
to hold in trust,

302
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:13,170
元老院準備好再次治理羅馬
until the Senate is ready to rule once more.

303
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:18,180
羅馬會再度成為共和國
Rome is to be a republic again.

304
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,720
- 馬西墨斯 - 對
- Maximus. - Yes.

305
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,060
我的決定使你失望了嗎?
My decision disappoints you?

306
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,650
你曾寫信給我
You wrote to me once,

307
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:40,950
上面列舉了四種主要的美德
listing the four chief virtues.

308
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,060
智慧...
Wisdom,

309
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,600
公正...
justice,

310
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,160
堅毅...
fortitude,

311
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,370
和自律
and temperance.

312
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,670
讀完信後我就明白自己一種都不具備
As I read the list, I knew I had none of them.

313
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:58,090
但我有其他的美德 父親
But I have other virtues, Father.

314
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,640
野心
Ambition.

315
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,850
當它驅使我們做的更優秀的時候 這也是一種美德
That can be a virtue when it drives us to excel.

316
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,270
智謀 勇氣
Resourcefulness, courage.

317
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:14,650
也許和行軍打仗無關 但...勇氣也有很多種的
Perhaps not on the battlefield, but there are many forms of courage.

318
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,530
對家庭的全心全意的奉獻...
Devotion to my family,

319
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,030
還有對你的愛
to you.

320
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:26,330
但你完全不欣賞我所有的優點
But none of my virtues were on your list.

321
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,900
就像你根本不希望有我這樣的兒子
Even then it was as if you didn't want me for your son.

322
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,380
康莫德斯
Commodus,

323
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,920
你想的太多了
you go too far.

324
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,720
我向天上的諸神祈求...
I searched the faces of the gods

325
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:44,850
讓我能夠討你歡心 讓你能夠以我為榮
for ways to please you, to make you proud.

326
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,720
只要一句讚美
One kind word,

327
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,060
或是一個擁抱...
one full hug,

328
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,900
把我緊緊的抱在你懷裡
where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight,

329
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:58,570
都會像慈藹的陽光溫暖我的心
would have been like the sun on my heart for 1, 000 years.

330
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,810
為什麼你如此討厭我?
What is it in me you hate so much?

331
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,120
康莫德斯
Commodus.

332
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,290
我不敢有任何奢求...
All I've ever wanted

333
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,830
只求能符合你的期望 凱撒
was to live up to you, Caesar.

334
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,750
- 父親 - 康莫德斯...
- Father. - Commodus,

335
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,260
養子不教...
your faults as a son

336
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,600
實為我作為父親的過錯啊
is my failure as a father.

337
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,780
過來
Come.

338
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,780
父親
Father.

339
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:02,420
為了讓你能愛我...
I would butcher the whole world,

340
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,800
即使血洗天下我也在所不惜!
if you would only have loved me!

341
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,550
馬西墨斯 皇帝有急事要找你
Maximus, the Emperor needs you. It's urgent.

342
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,850
和我一起哀悼 兄弟
Lament with me, brother.

343
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,890
我們偉大的父親去世了
Our great father is dead.

344
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,210
他怎樣死的?
How did he die?

345
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,160
醫生們說是呼吸衰竭
The surgeons say there was no pain.

346
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,390
他在睡夢中安詳的走了
His breath gave out as he slept.

347
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,400
父親
Father.

348
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,740
新皇帝需要你的忠誠 馬西墨斯
Your emperor asks for your loyalty, Maximus.

349
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,700
宣誓效忠於我
Take my hand.

350
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,240
我只給你一次機會
I only offer it once.

351
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,760
昆塔斯
Quintus.

352
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,480
凱撒萬歲
Hail, Caesar.

353
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,050
我要去見議員們 我需要他們的意見
I must talk to the senators. I need their counsel.

354
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,720
- 去叫醒蓋爾斯和佛克 - 蓋爾斯和佛克
- Wake Gaius and Falco. - Gaius and Falco.

355
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,030
- 我的劍 - 劍
- Sword. - Sword.

356
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:16,430
馬西墨斯 請三思而行 你的舉動太過輕率
Maximus, please be careful. That was not prudent.

357
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,330
輕率? 皇帝是被人謀殺的
Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.

358
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,290
皇帝是自然死亡
The emperor died of natural causes.

359
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,290
- 你為什麼全副武裝 昆塔斯? - 守衛!
- Why are you armed, Quintus? - Guards!

360
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,670
請不要反抗 馬西墨斯請不要反抗 馬西墨斯
Please don't fight, Maximus.

361
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,720
我很抱歉 是凱撒下的命令
I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.

362
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,970
騎馬西行...
Ride until dawn,

363
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,750
在拂曉前處死他
and then execute him.

364
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,270
昆塔斯 看著我 看著我!
Quintus, look at me. Look at me!

365
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,440
答應我 你會好好照顧我的家人
Promise me that you will look after my family.

366
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,190
你的家人會在黃泉路上與你相會的

369
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:25,390
轉告他們我只為再次擁抱他們而活
Whisper to them that I live only to hold them again.

370
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,400
至少讓我死的痛快點
At least give me a clean death.

371
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,900
一個軍人式的死亡
A soldier's death.

372
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,390
有時候 霜會把刀刃粘住的
The frost, sometimes it makes the blade stick.

373
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,450
禁衛兵!
Praetorian!

374
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,100
你上次回家是什麼時候?

I will try to live with the dignity you have taught me.

告訴他們 我生存是為了再次擁抱他們
Whisper to them, I live only to hold them again.

379
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:56,110
世間名利 於我皆如糞土
...with a ready sword, for all else is dust and air.

380
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:59,370
告訴他們 我生存是為了再次擁抱他們
Whisper to them, I live only to hold them again.

381
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,760

00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:58,070
你賣給我的那些長頸鹿...根本不會交配
Those giraffes you sold me, they won't mate.

398
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:06,830

- I do special price for you. - On what?

Have you seen my new stock? Come and see them.

402
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,560

Do any of them fight? I've got a match coming up.

403
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,430
有些人善於搏鬥 其他人只會去送死
Some are good for fighting, others for dying.

404
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:43,850
我想兩種人你都需要
You need both, I think.

405
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:45,160
站起來!
Get up.

我是獵人

軍團的標記
Mark of the legion.

411
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,860
- 逃兵 - 也許是吧 有誰在乎呢?
- Deserter. - Maybe so, but who cares?

412
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,420
他是個西班牙人
He's a Spaniard.

413
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,470
我要六個人... 給你1000
I'll take six. For 1, 000.

414
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:19,050
一千? 那個努米底亞人就值2000了
1, 000? The Numidian alone is won'th 2, 000.

415
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:21,220
這群奴隸根本不中用
These slaves are rotten.

416
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:24,490
人不可貌相 不 不 不 不 等等
It all adds to the flavor. No, no, no, wait! Wait!

417
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:26,700
等一下! 價錢好商量
I can negotiate.

418
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:31,980
我給你2000...另外給4000買那些野獸
I'll give you 2, 000, and 4, 000 for the beasts.

419
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:34,210
既然是老朋友 一共給你5000
That's 5, 000 for an old friend.

420
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:55,260
快一點! 還有多久才能回到家?
Come on! How long does it take to get into my own house?

421
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,280
我是普羅西莫!
I am Proximo.

422
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:00,510
接下來的幾天 將是你們悲慘的日子...
I shall be closer to you for the next few days,

423
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:02,810
結束前的最後的幾天 我會和你們異常的親近
which will be the last of your miserable lives,

424
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:07,240
勝過把你們帶到這世界來的該死的母親!
than that bitch of a mother that brought you screaming into this world.

425
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,870
我不是花錢買你們來做伴的!
I did not pay good money for you for your company.

426
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:15,290
我出錢是為了從你們的死亡中獲利
I paid it so that I could profit from your death.

427
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:19,800
你們的人生開始時 有母親在旁邊
And as your mother was there at your beginning,

428
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,390
結束時 我會在你們的身旁
so I shall be there at your end.

429
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:27,930
等到死亡的命運降臨時
And when you die, and die you shall,

430
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:31,770
你們將因人們的歡呼而昇華
your transition shall be to the sound of...

431
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:37,940
角鬥士們
Gladiators,

432
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:40,610
我向你們致敬
I salute you.

433
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:46,410
紅色
Red.

434
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:53,830
黃色
Yellow.

435
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,680
很好
Good.

436
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:07,850
紅色
- Red. - Red.

437
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:14,060
西班牙人!
Spaniard.

438
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:49,760
到此為止!
That's enough for the moment!

439
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,720
他遲早得認命的
His time will come.

440
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:55,810
下一個!
Next.

441
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,490
西班牙佬
Spaniard,

442
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:13,790
你為什麼不還手?
why don't you fight?

443
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,610
我們必須要搏鬥
We all have to fight.

444
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:17,420
我決不搏鬥
Well, I don't fight.

445
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:21,280
我不應在這裡 我是書吏 我負責記錄...
I shouldn't be here, I'm a scribe, I write down words,

446
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,240
我會說七種語言
and speak seven languages.

447
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,380
那好
Good.

448
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,340
明天你可用七種語言尖叫
Tomorrow, you can scream in seven languages.

449
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,980
或許書吏是例外 可以贏取自由
Perhaps the scribe will be the one who wins his freedom.

450
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,270
自由?
Freedom?

451
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,190
我需要做什麼?
What do I have to do?

452
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:47,890
你進競技場 殺了我
You go in the arena and you kill me.

453
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:49,360
還有他...
And him,

454
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:52,060
和這努米底亞人...
and the Numidian,

455
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,740
和這逃兵
and the deserter.

456
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:56,770
再多100個人
And 100 more.

457
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:59,710
直到你殺了所有鬥士 你便自由了
And when there's no more to fight, you're free.

458
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,130
我做不到
I can't do that.

459
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:04,380
做不到?
No?

460
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,050
但我做得到
But I can.

461
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:29,780
那是你信奉的神嗎?
Is that the sign of your gods?

462
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:37,080
這樣做他們不會生氣嗎?
Will that not anger them?

463
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:00,060
神眷顧你
The gods favor you.

464
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:02,600
紅色是天神的顏色
Red is the gods' color.

465
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,150
今天你會需要他們幫助
You will need their help today.

466
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,150
普羅西莫!
Proximo!

467
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:54,640
一直是日耳曼領導的?
Still leading with the German?

468
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,820
觀眾喜歡野蠻人
The crowd love a barbarian.

469
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,190
而且他令我富有
Besides that, he's making me rich.

470
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:01,910
那努米底亞人搏鬥過沒有?
Has that Numidian fought before?

471
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,320
沒有 第一次
No, first time.

472
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,380
那個 是奴隸 士兵?
And that one, laborer, soldier?

473
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,030
他是西班牙人
He's a Spaniard.

474
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:12,220
在場上像個廢人一樣
He might as well be a eunuch for what he brings to the ring.

475
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:17,370
五百元買努米底亞人 和西班牙人那隊會過關
500 sestertii, the Numidian and Spaniard team makes it through.

476
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:21,180
一千元 如果努米底亞人獨自過關
And 1, 000, that the Numidian makes it through alone.

477
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:25,810
你要我買自己的人輸?
Are you asking me to bet against my own man?

478
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:29,130
那是不道德的
It's unethical.

479
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:31,110
如果我加到二千元呢?
What if I make it 2, 000?

480
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,460
你們當中有些人不願意上場搏鬥
Some of you are thinking you won't fight,

481
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:51,050
有些覺得你不能搏鬥
some that you can't fight.

482
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,880
他們都喜歡唱高調 除非真正輪到自己出場
They all say that until they're out there.

483
00:57:58,580 --> 00:57:59,830
你們聽
Listen.

484
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:02,850
- 殺! 殺! 殺! - 殺! 殺! 殺!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! - Kill! Kill! Kill!

485
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,690
把刀用力刺進別人的身體裡
Thrust this into another mars flesh,

486
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:15,760
觀眾會為此而向你喝彩 崇拜你
and they will applaud and love you for that.

487
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,280
而你...
And you,

488
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:21,200
你也會開始為了喝彩聲...
you may begin to love them

489
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,450
而愛上他們
for that.

490
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,040
最終 我們都會化為一堆枯骨
Ultimately, we're all dead men.

491
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:35,880
可悲的是 我們無權選擇命運 但...
Sadly, we cannot choose how,

492
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:39,930
有權決定如何面對死亡...
but we can decide how we meet that end,

493
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,350
惟有如此 才能作為人
in order that we are remembered

494
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:46,500
被人們追憶
as men.

495
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,640
快!
Come on!

496
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:52,900
左邊的 拿盾牌!
On the left, draw your shields!

497
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,320
右邊的 拿劍!
On the right, draw your swords!

498
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:59,160
- 殺! 殺! - 殺! 殺!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! - Kill! Kill! Kill!

499
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,700
兩人一組 紅色和黃色一起
Pair them up, red with yellow.

500
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:08,960
下一個!
Next!

501
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:15,920
打!
Move!

502
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:34,270
奪權者!
Usurper!

503
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,690
- 滾開! - 我們不要你統治 康莫德斯!
- Go away! - You'll never rule us, Commodus!

504
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:34,810
他像個凱旋的英雄般回到羅馬 但他到底征服了什麼呢?
He enters Rome like a conquering hero. But what has he conquered?

505
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,500
給他點時間 格瑞克斯 他還年輕
Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.

506
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,890
我相信他可以做的很好
I think he could do very well.

507
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:42,190
為羅馬還是為你?
For Rome, or for you?

508
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:51,570
盧修斯 去歡迎你的母親 她會很高興的
Go to your mother, Lucius. It's what she'd like.

509
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:00,080
- 盧修斯! - 媽媽!
- Lucius! - Mother!

510
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,900
向你致敬 凱撒
Hail, Caesar.

511
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,500
議員們
Senators.

512
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:12,030
羅馬歡迎她的新皇帝
Rome greets her new emperor.

513
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:15,660
你忠心的臣子們向你表示歡迎 陛下
Your loyal subjects bid you welcome, Highness.

514
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,580
謝謝你 佛克
Thank you, Falco.

515
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:21,750
說到忠心的子民 我相信他們並不太昂貴
And for the loyal subjects, I trust they werert too expensive.

516
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,840
- 凱撒 - 格瑞克斯
- Caesar. - Gracchus.

517
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,420
羅馬為你的歸來而歡呼 凱撒
All Rome rejoices in your return, Caesar.

518
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:30,030
有許多政務等你來處理
But there are many matters that require your attention.

519
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:35,370
請肅靜! 肅靜!
To order, please. To order.

520
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:37,600
凱撒 為了請你指引
For your guidance, Caesar,

521
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,480
凱撒 元老院已經擬訂一系列的議程 好方便陛下過目...
the Senate has prepared a series of protocols

522
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,650
開始解決城市裡的眾多問題
to begin addressing the many problems in the city,

523
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:47,840
首先是希臘區的基礎衛生設備...
beginning with basic sanitation for the Greek Quarter,

524
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:51,950
設法消滅該區正在蔓延的瘟疫
to combat the plague which is already springing up there.

525
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:53,840
所以 如果凱撒...
So, if Caesar...

526
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:57,890
你難道還不明白 格瑞克斯?
Don't you see, Gracchus?

527
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:01,600
這才是問題的重點 不是嗎?
That's the very problem, isn't it?

528
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,690
我父親花費畢生的時間...
My father spent all his time at study,

529
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:09,820
研讀書本中的知識和哲學
at books of learning and philosophy.

530
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,320
他的晚年盡在閱讀元老院的卷軸中度過
He spent his twilight hours reading scrolls from the Senate.

531
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:18,490
然而自始至終 他卻忽略了人民...
And all the while, the people were forgotten.

532
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:21,270
但元老會就代表人民 陛下
But the senate is the people, sire,

533
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:24,920
由人民中選出議員 為人民說話
chosen from among the people to speak for the people.

534
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:29,210
我懷疑民眾是否像你一樣豐衣足食 格瑞克斯
I doubt many of the people eat so well as you do, Gracchus.

535
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:32,410
或是像蓋爾斯一樣妻妾成群
Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.

536
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:34,580
我自認瞭解我的子民
I think I understand my own people.

537
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:38,180
那麼 根據您個人的多方面的經驗...
Then perhaps Caesar will be so good as to teach us,

538
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,220
陛下或許會不吝賜教
out of his own extensive experience.

539
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,650
我認為是愛
I call it love.

540
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:50,360
我會愛民如子 因為他們都是我的子民
I am their father. The people are my children.

541
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:53,140
我會將他們緊緊的擁抱在我的胸前
And I shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly.

542
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:56,700
陛下 你曾擁抱過身染瘟疫的人嗎?
Have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire?

543
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:05,620
沒有 但如果你再打斷我的話
No, but if you interrupt me again,

544
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:08,440
我保證你一定會的
I assure you that you shall.

545
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,880
議員 我弟弟非常疲倦
Senator, my brother is very tired.

546
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:16,050
把議程給我 凱撒應該照人民的意願行事
Leave your list with me. Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.

547
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:21,560
夫人 你總是讓人不能不服
My lady, as always, your lightest touch commands obedience.

548
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:30,940
他們憑什麼對我說教?
Who are they to lecture me?

549
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:33,760
康莫德斯 元老院自有它的用處
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

550
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,740
什麼用處? 他們只會耍嘴皮子
What uses? All they do is talk.

551
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:42,480
根本就只需要...你和我...
It should be just you and me and Rome.

552
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,910
千萬不可以這麼想! 元老院自建國之初就存在著
Don't even think it. There's always been a Senate.

553
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:48,070
羅馬已經變了
Rome has changed.

554
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:51,210
只要有一個皇帝...就可以治理帝國了
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.

555
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:53,570
當然 讓人民繼續擁有...
Of course, but leave the people their...

556
01:06:53,570 --> 01:06:55,050
幻想
Illusions?

557
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:58,090
傳統
Traditions.

558
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:01,760
我父親對野蠻人發動戰爭...
My father's war against the barbarians.

559
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:06,000
他自己也承認那毫無意義 但是人民敬愛他
He said it himself, it achieved nothing. But the people loved him.

560
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,960
人民總是喜歡勝利的感覺的
The people always love victories.

561
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,730
為什麼? 他們並沒有目睹戰爭的殘酷
Why? They didn't see the battles.

562
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:15,010
日耳曼人和他們毫不相關
What do they care about Germania?

563
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:17,430
他們只關心羅馬的富強
They care about the greatness of Rome.

564
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:19,450
"羅馬的富強"
"The greatness of Rome."

565
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:23,200
那到底是什麼呢?
Well, what is that?

566
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:29,120
是一種理念... 富強
It's an idea. Greatness.

567
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:36,300
- 富強是一種憧憬 - 沒錯 一個憧憬
- Greatness is a vision. - Exactly. A vision.

568
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:40,340
你還不明白嗎 露西拉?
Do you not see, Lucilla?

569
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:45,680
我會給人民一個羅馬的新憧憬 他們會為此而敬愛我
I will give the people a vision of Rome, and they'll love me for it.

570
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:50,730
他們很快就會忘掉那幾個愛說教的老頭
And they'll soon forget the tedious sermonizing of a few dry old men.

571
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:05,450
我會給羅馬人民一個前所未有的憧憬
I will give the people the greatest vision of their lives.

572
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:47,790
鬥士 - 暴力

573
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:59,590
酒 酒 酒! 紅酒白酒任君暢飲!
White and red wine for your drinking pleasure!

574
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:09,060
競技
Games.

575
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:14,400
整整150天的競技活動
One hundred and fifty days of games.

576
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,420
他比我想像中的要聰明
He's cleverer than I thought.

577
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:20,070
聰明 要不是因為害怕他的禁衛隊...
Clever. The whole of Rome would be laughing at him,

578
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,140
全羅馬的人都會嘲笑他的
if they werert so afraid of his Praetorians.

579
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:26,030
害怕和好奇...強而有力的組合
Fear and wonder. A powerful combination.

580
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:30,560
你真的認為民眾會被他的手段所欺騙?
You really think the people are going to be seduced by that?

581
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,750
我覺得他瞭解羅馬的本質 羅馬是由一群烏合之眾組成的
I think he knows what Rome is. Rome is the mob.

582
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:37,580
變魔術給他們看 就可以轉移他們的注意力
Conjure magic for them, and they'll be distracted.

583
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:41,420
奪去他們的自由 他們還是會繼續哄堂大笑
Take away their freedom, and still they'll roar.

584
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:46,330
維繫著羅馬命脈的...並不是元老院裡的大理石
The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate.

585
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:48,430
而是競技場內的沙地
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

586
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:52,470
他會把死亡帶給人民
He'll bring them death,

587
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:56,600
而人民會為此而敬愛他
and they will love him for it.

588
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:21,360
你只需殺殺殺
All you do is kill, kill, kill.

589
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,860
觀眾不是要屠夫 他們要英雄
The crowd don't want a butcher, they want a hero.

590
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:25,990
我們要他們不斷回來看
We want them to keep coming back.

591
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:30,260
所以不要只顧把他們斬殺 記著你是要娛樂觀眾
So don't just hack them to pieces, remember you are an entertainer.

592
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,220
西班牙人
Spaniard.

593
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:43,570
快去娛樂他們!
So entertain!

594
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:52,800
你們還不滿意嗎? 你們還不滿意嗎?
Are you not entertained? Are you not entertained?

595
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,350
你們不正是為此而來這裡的嗎?
Is this not why you're here?

596
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,980
西班牙人!
Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

597
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:09,440
- 西班牙人! 西班牙人! 西班牙人! - 西班牙人! 西班牙人! 西班牙人!
- Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard! - Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

598
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:24,000
你想要些什麼?
What do you want?

599
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:27,710
女孩?
Girl?

600
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:29,920
男孩?
Boy?

601
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:33,090
- 你找我有事? - 是的
- You sent for me. - Yes, I did.

602
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,250
西班牙人 你的確很棒 但你還不是最厲害的
You're good, Spaniard, but you're not that good.

603
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:38,500
你可以變的更優秀
You could be magnificent.

604
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:42,100
我殺人是因為你要我這麼做 這樣就夠了
I'm required to kill, so I kill. That is enough.

605
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:46,020
也許在鄉下小地方是夠了 但在羅馬卻行不通
That's enough for the provinces, but not for Rome.

606
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:53,310
那年輕皇帝安排了一系列表演...
The young emperor has arranged a series of spectacles

607
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:57,580
來紀念他的父親 馬可·奧勒留
to commemorate his father, Marcus Aurelius.

608
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:00,080
我覺得很好笑...
I find that amusing,

609
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:03,480
因為正是馬可·奧勒留...
since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise,

610
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:07,040
博學 無所不知的馬可·奧勒留...禁止了搏鬥競技活動
the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius, that closed us down.

611
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:14,160
在這個跳蚤為患的村莊...
So finally, after five years of scratching a living

612
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,450
生活了五年以後
in flea-infested villages,

613
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:19,600
我們終於要回到屬於我們的地方...
we're finally going back to where we belong.

614
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:21,890
羅馬競技場
The Colosseum.

615
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:26,940
你應該去看看競技場 西班牙人
You should see the Colosseum, Spaniard.

616
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:30,320
五萬羅馬觀眾...
Fifty thousand Romans,

617
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:35,110
注視著你鬥劍時的一舉一動
watching every movement of your sword,

618
01:13:36,430 --> 01:13:39,030
期待你揮出致命的一擊
willing you to make that killer blow.

619
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:43,830
在你揮劍之前的寂靜...和那之後的騷動
The silence before you strike and the noise afterwards.

620
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:48,460
喧鬧聲不斷的提高...
It rises. It rises up,

621
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:51,300
就像...一場暴風雨...
like a storm.

622
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:54,740
而你自己就是雷神
As if you were the thunder god himself.

623
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:57,800
- 你曾是個角鬥士? - 對 我是
- You were a gladiator? - Yes, I was.

624
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:06,420
你贏得了你的自由?
You won your freedom?

625
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:08,860
很久以前 皇帝...
A long time ago, the Emperor

626
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:12,590
送給我一把劍
presented me with a rudius.

627
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:15,400
那只是一把木劍
It's just a wooden sword.

628
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:19,370
你得到自由的象徵
The symbol of your freedom.

629
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,540
他用木劍點了點我的肩 我便獲得了自由
He touched me on the shoulder, and I was free.

630
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:28,320
你認識馬可·奧勒留?
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

631
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:32,670
我沒說我認識他 我說他曾經碰過我的肩膀
I did not say I knew him. I said he touched me on the shoulder once.

632
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,380
你問我到底想要什麼
You asked me what I want.

633
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:39,680
我也希望站在皇帝面前...
I, too, want to stand in front of the Emperor,

634
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:42,330
就像你一樣
as you did.

635
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:45,850
那你就得聽我的 向我學習
Then listen to me. Learn from me.

636
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:49,770
我並不是最棒的 因為我殺人太快了
I wasrt the best because I killed quickly.

637
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,650
我之所以是最棒的 是因為民眾崇拜我
I was the best because the crowd loved me.

638
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,070
贏取觀眾的心 你就能贏得自由
Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom.

639
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,410
我會贏得觀眾的心
I will win the crowd.

640
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:10,080
我將讓他們看見從未見過的東西!
I will give them something they've never seen before.

641
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:14,090
那麼 西班牙人 我們一起去羅馬
So, Spaniard, we shall go to Rome together

642
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:16,570
展開一趟血腥的冒險!
and have bloody adventures.

643
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:18,450
觀眾會讓我們的荷包撐滿...
And the great whore will suckle us

644
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:21,120
開心的笑不出來
until we are fat and happy and can suckle no more.

645
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,680
然後...
And then,

646
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:25,930
殺了足夠多的人後
when enough men have died,

647
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,560
也許你就可以得到你的自由
perhaps you will have your freedom.

648
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,320
接著 這個給你
Here. Use this.

649
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:04,220
在遠處的某個地方...有我的祖國
It's somewhere out there, my country.

650
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:06,640
我的家
My home.

651
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:09,980
我的妻子正在準備食物
My wife is preparing food.

652
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:13,650
我的女兒從河邊打水回來
My daughters carry water from the river.

653
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,030
我還能再見到他們嗎?
Will I ever see them again?

654
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:19,820
我想沒機會了
I think, no.

655
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:22,560
你相信死後能再見到他們嗎?
Do you believe you'll see them again when you die?

656
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,030
我相信
I think so.

657
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:27,740
但是 我很快就會死了
But then, I will die soon.

658
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:31,830
他們會再活很多年
They will not die for many years.

659
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:34,280
我得等他們
I'll have to wait.

660
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,550
但是你願意...等
But you would? Wait?

661
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:38,550
當然
Of course.

662
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:41,840
你知道的
You see,

663
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:46,560
我的妻兒...
my wife and my son

664
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:50,420
已經在等著我了
are already waiting for me.

665
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:54,190
你會再見到他們的 只是時候未到
You'll meet them again. But not yet.

666
01:16:58,130 --> 01:16:59,610
時候未到
Not yet.

667
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:02,900
- 除非... - 時候未到
- Unless... - Not yet.

668
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:08,200
時候未到
Not yet.

669
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:22,630
他在那裡
There he is.

670
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:12,890
出來!
Out.

671
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,020
快出來!
Move, go, out!

672
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,240
老朋友 真高興又看見你
Good to see you again, old friend.

673
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,290
帶給我財富
Bring me fortune.

674
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:45,760
你以前看見過這麼壯觀的建築嗎?
Have you ever seen anything like that before?

675
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:49,430
我不知道他們是如何辦到的
I didn't know men could build such things.

676
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:00,980
贏得觀眾的心
Win the crowd.

677
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:03,510
快進去! 走
Get inside. Move.

678
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:04,900
進去
Inside.

679
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:56,870
他睡的好香因為他備受寵愛
He sleeps so well because he's loved.

680
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:01,880
走吧 弟弟 已經很晚了
Come, brother. It's late.

681
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,300
我將使羅馬成為當代的奇跡
I will make Rome the wonder of the ages.

682
01:20:10,990 --> 01:20:14,430
那是格瑞克斯和他的朋友所不明白的
That is what Gracchus and his friends don't understand.

683
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:18,060
我的慾望在腦海中起伏 讓我頭痛欲裂
All my desires are splitting my head to pieces.

684
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:27,860
康莫德斯 喝了這蘇打水
Commodus, drink this tonic.

685
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:39,870
我看時機已經成熟
I think the time is almost right.

686
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:43,150
我可以在悼念父親的慶典上...
I could announce the dissolution of the Senate

687
01:20:43,150 --> 01:20:45,320
宣佈解散元老院
at the celebration to honor our father.

688
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,380
你認為我該這麼做嗎?
Do you think I should?

689
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:50,050
人民能接受嗎?
Are the people ready?

690
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,550
我想你現在需要休息
I think you need your rest now.

691
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:02,290
你會不會留下來陪我?
Will you stay with me?

692
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,810
弟弟 你還是怕黑嗎?
Still afraid of the dark, brother?

693
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:12,780
是的
Still.

694
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,910
永遠都怕
Always.

695
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:20,500
- 今晚留下來陪我? - 你知道那不可能
- Stay with me tonight. - You know I won't.

696
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:26,500
那就吻我一下
Then kiss me.

697
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:36,850
晚安 弟弟
Sleep, brother.

698
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:31,760
又聾又啞的僕人...
Having servants who are deaf and mute

699
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,610
至少讓我活得久一點
at least ensures I live a little longer.

700
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:38,720
他們在拘捕學者
They're arresting scholars now.

701
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:42,660
任何敢表達意見的 甚至包括作家和史學家
Anyone who dare speak out. Even satirists and chroniclers.

702
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:45,210
還有數學家
And mathematicians.

703
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,540
全部送到鬥獸場
And all to feed the arena.

704
01:22:50,110 --> 01:22:52,610
國會沒有通過戒嚴法
The Senate did not approve martial law.

705
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:55,550
這全是禁衛軍的恐怖勢力
This reign of terror is entirely the Praetorians.

706
01:22:56,620 --> 01:22:58,830
我入黑後不敢外出
I'm afraid to go out after dark.

707
01:22:58,830 --> 01:23:02,460
你更應擔心日間的出行
You should be more afraid of your activities during the day.

708
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:07,270
國會中佈滿他的線眼 由那好色的科高領導的
The Senate is full of his spies, led by that whore master, Falco.

709
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:13,020
究竟他在想什麼? 那是最令我困惑的
But what is in his mind? That's what I trouble myself with.

710
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:16,720
他整天只顧...
He spends all his days singularly obsessed,

711
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:19,640
籌劃你父親的紀念慶典
planning the festival to honor your father.

712
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:23,330
他連政府最基本的工作也忽略
He neglects even the most fundamental task of government.

713
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:26,290
他到底在計劃什麼?
So just what is he planning?

714
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,270
用什麼來支付?
And what pays for it?

715
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:32,590
每天這些競技支出龐大 但我們沒加新稅項
These daily games are costing a fortune, yet we have no new taxes.

716
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,750
未來
The future.

717
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:38,170
用未來支付
The future pays for it.

718
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:42,500
他已開始賣貯備的穀物
He's started selling the grain reserves.

719
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,430
不是吧
This can't be true.

720
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,560
他在賣羅馬貯備的穀物
He's selling Rome's reserves of grain.

721
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:51,060
人民在兩年後便會捱餓
The people will be starving in two years.

722
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:53,090
希望他們享受這遊戲...
I hope they're enjoying the games,

723
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:56,570
那些競技不久他們便會因此而滅亡
because soon enough they'll be dead because of them.

724
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,240
- 羅馬人要知道真相 - 怎樣?
- Rome must know this. - And how?

725
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:02,120
他打算解散國會
He's going to dissolve the Senate.

726
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:06,290
誰會及時告訴他們? 你 格瑞克斯?
And who will tell them before it's too late? You, Gracchus?

727
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,110
你 蓋爾斯
You, Gaius.

728
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:10,900
你會否在國會上發表演說
Will you make a speech on the floor of the Senate,

729
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:12,750
指責我哥哥?
denouncing my brother?

730
01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:15,840
然後看著你全家被推進鬥獸場?
And then see your family in the Colosseum?

731
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,170
誰敢?
Who'd dare?

732
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:30,380
我每天都活在恐懼中...
I have been living in a prison of fear every day,

733
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:33,060
因為我兒子是皇位繼承人
because my son is heir to the throne.

734
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:40,150
他一定要死
He must die.

735
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:48,270
但昆塔斯和禁衛軍會奪去控制權
Quintus and the Praetorians would simply seize control for themselves.

736
01:24:48,270 --> 01:24:52,230
不 把領導者殺了就不會失去控制權
No. Cut off the head and the snake cannot strike.

737
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:54,360
露西娜 蓋爾斯說得對
Lucilla, Gaius is right.

738
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:58,590
不能壓制禁衛軍的話 我們不會成功
Until we can neutralize the Praetorians, we can achieve nothing.

739
01:25:00,030 --> 01:25:01,620
那我們坐以待斃?
So we do nothing?

740
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:04,510
不 我們在暗中計劃
No, child. We keep our counsel.

741
01:25:05,410 --> 01:25:06,850
我們準備
We prepare.

742
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:12,480
人民支持他 我們的聲音便沒有力量
As long as the people support him, we are voices without steel.

743
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:14,690
我們是空氣
We are air.

744
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:20,470
但每天他都在豎敵
But with every day that passes, he makes enemies.

745
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:23,450
終有一天 他的敵人會多過朋友
One day, he'll have more enemies than friends.

746
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,820
那就是我們行動的時候
And on that day, we will act.

747
01:25:27,310 --> 01:25:29,290
那時我們便反擊
Then we will strike.

748
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,960
在那刻來臨前...
But until then,

749
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:34,710
我們是聽話的
we are docile.

750
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:37,340
我們是服從的
We are obedient.

751
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:40,920
而我們亦是不忠的
And we are treacherous.

752
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:50,720
快!
Come on!

753
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:01,610
好了 夠了
All right, that's enough.

754
01:26:24,070 --> 01:26:25,490
皇帝想看搏鬥
The Emperor wants battles,

755
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:27,740
但我不想犧牲最好的鬥士
and I don't want to sacrifice my best fighters.

756
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:31,160
觀眾想看競技 所以皇帝就舉辦大型的競技搏鬥
The crowd wants battles, so the Emperor gives them battles.

757
01:26:31,170 --> 01:26:34,850
- 你的人將參加迦太基的戰役 - 迦太基的大屠殺
- You get the battle of Can'thage. - Massacre of Can'thage.

758
01:26:36,710 --> 01:26:38,210
你為什麼不把監獄裡的
Well, why don't you go down to the prison,

759
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:40,300
乞丐小偷都找來?
round up all the beggars and thieves?

760
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:41,550
我們早就這麼做了
We've done that.

761
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:44,010
如果你想要我犧牲
If you want to give away the best gladiators

762
01:26:44,010 --> 01:26:45,260
全帝國最棒的角鬥士
in the whole of the empire,

763
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:47,470
就得給我雙倍的錢
then I want double the rates.

764
01:26:47,470 --> 01:26:51,350
我們要麼按照合約給錢 要麼就取消合約
You'll get your contract rates, or you'll get your contract canceled.

765
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:52,850
你不高興嗎?
You don't like it?

766
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:56,910
那就滾回你的老家去
Then you can crawl back down that shit hole that you came from.

767
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:02,170
等等 卡西亞斯!
Cassius, please. You can free us.

768
01:27:31,890 --> 01:27:35,100
你就是外號"西班牙人"的角鬥士嗎?
Gladiator, are you the one they call the Spaniard?

769
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:36,330
是的
Yes.

770
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:39,320
他們都說你力大無窮
They said you were a giant.

771
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:42,570
他們說你單手就能捏碎大人的頭
They said you could crush a mars skull with one hand.

772
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:44,420
大人的? 不可能
A mars? No.

773
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:47,090
小孩的也許可以
A boy's.

774
01:27:48,990 --> 01:27:52,640
- 西班牙有良種馬嗎? - 有最優秀的馬
- Do they have good horses in Spain? - Some of the best.

775
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:56,770
這是銀子 這是黑點
This is Argento and this is Scan'to.

776
01:27:58,090 --> 01:27:59,980
他們是我的馬
They were my horses.

777
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,980
可是被別人搶走了
They were taken from me.

778
01:28:03,170 --> 01:28:06,570
我很喜歡你 西班牙人 我會替你加油的
I like you, Spaniard. I shall cheer for you.

779
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:10,430
- 他們准你看競技比賽? - 我舅舅說這會使我變得勇敢
- They let you watch the games? - My uncle says it makes me strong.

780
01:28:10,430 --> 01:28:13,830
- 那你父親怎樣說? - 我父親死了
- And what does your father say? - My father is dead.

781
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:17,660
盧修斯少爺 該走了
Master Lucius, it is time.

782
01:28:18,810 --> 01:28:20,270
我得走了
I have to go.

783
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:21,960
你叫盧修斯?
Your name is Lucius?

784
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:26,750
盧修斯維勒斯 為了紀念我父親
Lucius Verus, after my father.

785
01:28:57,310 --> 01:28:59,120
往下放!
Lower!

786
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:07,150
- 哥地亞斯! - 是?
- Claudius! - Yes?

787
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:09,670
- 克勞迪亞斯! 還要更多的盾牌! - 好的 長官
- More shields! - All right.

788
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:33,510
當皇上進場時 舉起你們的武器向他致敬
When the Emperor enters, raise your weapons, salute him,

789
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:35,660
然後齊聲向他問候!
and then speak together.

790
01:29:36,350 --> 01:29:39,950
面對著皇帝 不可以背對著他!
Face the Emperor and don't turn your back on him.

791
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:43,920
去吧! 為榮譽而戰!
Go, and die with honor.

792
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:41,060
歡迎偉大的凱撒!
Hail, mighty Caesar!

793
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:48,520
- 凱撒萬歲! 凱撒萬歲! - 凱撒萬歲! 凱撒萬歲!
- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! - Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

794
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:54,530
- 角鬥士們向您致敬! - 角鬥士們向您致敬!
- We who are about to die salute you! - We who are about to die salute you!

795
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:57,820
今天...
On this day

796
01:30:58,430 --> 01:31:01,530
我們把戰場移到神聖的古代...
we reach back to hallowed antiquity

797
01:31:02,310 --> 01:31:06,060
呈現在各位面前的是...
to bring you a re-creation of the second fall

798
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:08,210
迦太基淪亡的歷史戰役!
of mighty Can'thage!

799
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:16,340
在荒蕪的扎馬平原上...
On the barren plain of Zama

800
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:20,050
漢尼拔將軍的...
there stood the invincible armies

801
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:23,060
不可戰勝的野蠻人軍隊正嚴陣以待
of the barbarian Hannibal.

802
01:31:23,670 --> 01:31:26,920
來自所有殘暴民族的...
Ferocious mercenaries and warriors

803
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:29,380
傭兵和戰士們...
from all brute nations,

804
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:33,770
毫不留情的破壞
bent on merciless destruction,

805
01:31:34,550 --> 01:31:36,030
征服
conquest.

806
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:40,970
你們的皇帝很榮幸的為大家介紹...
Your emperor is pleased to give you

807
01:31:40,970 --> 01:31:44,120
野蠻的異幫人!
the barbarian horde!

808
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:54,450
有人在軍隊裡服役過嗎?
Anyone here been in the army?

809
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:57,470
有 我曾在凡度巴納和你一起服役
Yes. I served with you at Vindobona.

810
01:31:58,330 --> 01:32:00,090
你可以幫我忙
You can help me.

811
01:32:01,290 --> 01:32:03,930
不管從鐵門後出現的是什麼
Whatever comes out of these gates,

812
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:08,460
我們只有同心協力才會有較大的勝算
we've got a better chance of survival ifwe work together.

813
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:10,270
你明白嗎?
Do you understand?

814
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:14,420
只有團結一致 我們才能活命
Lfwe stay together, we survive.

815
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:17,640
我很榮幸為你們介紹...
The Emperor is pleased to bring you the legionnaires

816
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:21,320
非洲的西比歐軍團
of Scipio Africanus!

817
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:33,830
奮戰到底!
To the death!

818
01:32:37,530 --> 01:32:40,220
- 殺! 殺! 殺! - 殺! 殺! 殺!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! - Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

819
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,640
大家靠攏!
Stay close.

820
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:53,520
集合起來!
Come together!

821
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:58,900
縱隊交錯排列!
Stay close. Staggered columns!

822
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:14,170
你沒機會了!
You don't have a chance.

823
01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:28,060
固定盾牌! 緊密銜接!
Lock your shields. Stay as one.

824
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:31,140
穩住!
Hold!

825
01:33:33,090 --> 01:33:36,190
穩住! 盾牌銜接起來!
Hold! As one!

826
01:33:39,010 --> 01:33:40,440
做得好
Well done.

827
01:33:52,230 --> 01:33:56,170
穩住! 下面!
Hold. Down low!

828
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:03,170
好!
Yes!

829
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:16,520
賀格!
Hagen!

830
01:34:40,530 --> 01:34:44,170
一隊去移戰車! 一隊...跟我來!
This column to the chariot! This column stay with me!

831
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:49,180
快點!
Quickly!

832
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:52,600
- 去前面! - 快!
- Get out there. - Hurry!

833
01:35:33,710 --> 01:35:34,970
馬西墨斯!
Maximus!

834
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:49,610
單排隊形! 排成一排!
Single column! Single column!

835
01:36:34,810 --> 01:36:36,330
我們贏了!
We win!

836
01:36:41,610 --> 01:36:44,210
我對歷史不太清楚 卡西亞斯
My history's a little hazy, Cassius,

837
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:47,950
不過應該是野蠻人打輸了迦太基戰役吧?
but shouldn't the barbarians lose the battle of Can'thage?

838
01:36:47,950 --> 01:36:49,800
是的 陛下
Yes, sire.

839
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:53,080
請見諒 陛下
Forgive me, sire.

840
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:55,890
沒關係 我喜歡驚喜
No, I rather enjoy surprises.

841
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:57,790
他是誰?
Who is he?

842
01:36:57,790 --> 01:37:00,890
他們叫他做西班牙人 陛下
They call him the Spaniard, sire.

843
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:05,300
我想見見他
I think I'll meet him.

844
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:06,730
是 陛下
Yes, sire.

845
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:10,860
為野蠻人歡呼!
Hail to the barbarians!

846
01:37:25,690 --> 01:37:29,210
前進! 嚴密戒備!
Forward! Arms at ready!

847
01:37:42,670 --> 01:37:44,440
放下武器!
Drop your weapons.

848
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:51,400
皇帝要見你 角鬥士
Gladiator, the Emperor has asked for you.

849
01:37:51,890 --> 01:37:54,240
我隨時聽候差遣
I am at the Emperor's service.

850
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:23,060
起身 起身
Rise. Rise.

851
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:34,640
西班牙人 你果然名不虛傳
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard.

852
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:37,220
我相信其他的角鬥士都不是你的對手
I don't think there's ever been a gladiator to match you.

853
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:40,230
這位年輕人堅持你是赫克托轉世
As for this young man, he insists you are Hector reborn.

854
01:38:40,230 --> 01:38:41,910
還是你是大力神的化身?
Or was it Hercules?

855
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:47,170
你為何不表明身份 告訴大家你的真名?
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself and tell us all your real name?

856
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:50,840
你總有名字吧?
You do have a name.

857
01:38:51,530 --> 01:38:53,510
"角鬥士"就是我的名字
My name is Gladiator.

858
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:59,970
你竟敢背對著我? 奴隸!
How dare you show your back to me? Slave!

859
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:04,680
脫掉頭盔 告訴我你的名字
You will remove your helmet and tell me your name.

860
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:18,950
我叫馬西墨斯德西斯梅裡丟斯
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius,

861
01:39:19,220 --> 01:39:21,270
北方軍隊的指揮官
commander of the armies of the north,

862
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:23,690
菲力克斯軍團的將軍
general of the Felix Legions,

863
01:39:23,690 --> 01:39:27,080
真正的皇帝馬可·奧勒留忠心的僕人
loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius,

864
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,670
兒子被人謀殺
father to a murdered son,

865
01:39:31,030 --> 01:39:33,420
妻子遭人殺害...
husband to a murdered wife,

866
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:37,510
不管今生或來世 我定會為他們復仇
and I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.

867
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:45,890
衛兵!
Arms!

868
01:39:58,890 --> 01:40:02,310
活! 活! 活! 活! 活! 活!
Live! Live! Live! Live!

869
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:05,620
- 活 活 活 - 活 活 活
- Live! Live! Live! Live! - Live! Live! Live! Live!

870
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:52,330
衛兵 退下!
Arms, at rest!

871
01:41:44,740 --> 01:41:49,310
- 馬西墨斯! 馬西墨斯! - 馬西墨斯! 馬西墨斯!
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! - Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

872
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:38,560
父親
Father.

873
01:43:52,830 --> 01:43:54,810
他怎麼還活著?
Why is he still alive?

874
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:57,560
我不知道
I don't know.

875
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:59,640
他應該早就死了
He shouldn't be alive.

876
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:01,900
實在讓人煩惱
It vexes me.

877
01:44:03,550 --> 01:44:05,440
我非常生氣
I'm terribly vexed.

878
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,580
我只是做了不得不做的事
I did what I had to do.

879
01:44:19,230 --> 01:44:23,360
要是按照父親的意願 羅馬早就解體了
If Father had had his way, the empire would have been torn apart.

880
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:25,130
你明白的 是嗎?
You do see that.

881
01:44:25,410 --> 01:44:26,670
是的
Yes.

882
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:34,680
你看到他的時候有何感覺?
What did you feel when you saw him?

883
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:38,430
沒有任何感覺
I felt nothing.

884
01:44:40,290 --> 01:44:42,940
看來他傷得你很深 對不對?
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

885
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:46,190
我傷害他更深
No more than I wounded him.

886
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:52,990
在日耳曼的時候他們說謊
They lied to me in Germania.

887
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:56,700
他們告訴我他已經死了
They told me he was dead.

888
01:44:58,600 --> 01:45:01,270
他們騙我 即是不尊重我
If they lie to me, they don't respect me.

889
01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:04,710
既然如此 他們又怎麼可能愛我?
If they don't respect me, how can they ever love me?

890
01:45:05,950 --> 01:45:08,410
那麼你必須讓軍團瞭解...
Then you must let the legions know

891
01:45:08,410 --> 01:45:11,590
他們的背叛行為一定會受到懲罰
their treachery will not go unpunished.

892
01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:13,890
可憐的姐姐
Poor sister.

893
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:16,760
我絕對不想與你為敵
I wouldn't want to be your enemy.

894
01:45:17,870 --> 01:45:19,720
你打算怎麼做?
What will you do?

895
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:34,030
出來!
This way.

896
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:12,840
貴婦人付高價是為了讓英勇的角鬥士取悅她
Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions.

897
01:46:12,850 --> 01:46:15,450
我知道你弟弟會派刺客來
I knew your brother would send assassins.

898
01:46:15,850 --> 01:46:18,580
但我沒想到他會派最好的來
I didn't realize he would send his best.

899
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:22,290
馬西墨斯 他毫不知情
Maximus, he doesn't know.

900
01:46:23,150 --> 01:46:26,360
我的家人被釘在十字架上活活燒死
My family was burnt and crucified while they were still alive.

901
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:29,000
- 我真的不知情... - 別對我撒謊!
- I knew nothing... - Don't lie to me!

902
01:46:35,370 --> 01:46:37,200
我為他們哭泣
I wept for them.

903
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:41,120
就像你為你父親哭泣?
As you wept for your father? As you wept for your father?

904
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:44,810
自從我父親去世後 我便生活在恐懼之中
I have been living in a prison of fear since that day.

905
01:46:45,210 --> 01:46:49,150
因為害怕自己的弟弟而無法哀悼自己的父親
To be unable to mourn your father for fear of your brother.

906
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:53,220
因為自己的兒子也是王位繼承人
To live in terror every moment of every day,

907
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:56,110
我時時刻刻都生活在恐懼之中
because your son is heir to the throne.

908
01:46:57,890 --> 01:46:59,450
我有哭過
I have wept.

909
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:03,620
我兒子是無辜的
My son was innocent.

910
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:06,500
我兒子也是
So is mine.

911
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:11,590
難道非得用我兒子的命來換取你的信任?
Must my son die, too, before you'll trust me?

912
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:16,010
我是否信任你又有何區別?
What does it matter if I trust you or not?

913
01:47:16,780 --> 01:47:19,910
你難道不明白? 神已經寬恕你了
The gods have spared you. Don't you understand?

914
01:47:19,910 --> 01:47:23,460
今天我看見了比羅馬皇帝還要有權力的奴隸
Today I saw a slave become more powerful than the emperor of Rome.

915
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:25,330
諸神已經寬恕我了?
The gods have spared me?

916
01:47:25,330 --> 01:47:28,880
因為他們的憐憫 我才有娛樂觀眾的力量!
I am at their mercy, with the power only to amuse a mob.

917
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,520
那就是力量
That is power.

918
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:32,130
觀眾代表著羅馬
The mob is Rome.

919
01:47:32,130 --> 01:47:35,860
康莫德斯控制了他們就等於掌控了一切
And while Commodus controls them, he controls everything.

920
01:47:36,100 --> 01:47:37,740
聽我說
Listen to me.

921
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:41,390
元老院的大多數人都是我弟弟的敵人
My brother has enemies, most of all in the Senate.

922
01:47:41,390 --> 01:47:43,730
只是當人民都支持他的時候:
But while the people follow him,

923
01:47:43,730 --> 01:47:46,870
沒有人敢和他正面衝突 除了你
no one would dare stand up to him until you.

924
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:50,110
他們反對他 卻什麼事都不做
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.

925
01:47:50,110 --> 01:47:53,950
有些政治家為羅馬奉獻出全部的心力
There are some politicians who have dedicated their lives to Rome.

926
01:47:53,950 --> 01:47:55,800
他們有個領袖
One man above all.

927
01:47:56,780 --> 01:47:59,970
如果我出面安排 你願意和他見面嗎?
If I can arrange it, will you meet him?

928
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:02,220
你到底明不明白?
Do you not understand?

929
01:48:02,370 --> 01:48:06,670
我只是個奴隸 隨時隨地都有可能喪命
I may die in this cell tonight, or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!

930
01:48:06,670 --> 01:48:09,440
我又能改變些什麼呢?
What possible difference can I make?

931
01:48:09,630 --> 01:48:11,960
這個人有和你一樣的目的
This man wants what you want.

932
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:14,270
那就讓他去殺了康莫德斯!
Then have him kill Commodus!

933
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,700
我曾經認識一個人...
I knew a man once,

934
01:48:19,510 --> 01:48:20,910
一個高尚的人
a noble man.

935
01:48:21,810 --> 01:48:24,780
他不但有原則...而且還敬愛我的父親
A man of principle who loved my father,

936
01:48:25,650 --> 01:48:27,830
我的父親也愛他
and my father loved him.

937
01:48:29,690 --> 01:48:31,960
這個人為羅馬貢獻良多
This man served Rome well.

938
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:38,010
那人已經死了
That man is gone.

939
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:41,280
你弟弟干的很成功
Your brother did his work well.

940
01:48:41,290 --> 01:48:43,050
讓我幫你
Let me help you.

941
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:52,060
對 你能幫我
Yes, you can help me.

942
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:59,110
忘了我們曾經相識...再也不要來這裡看我
Forget you ever knew me, never come here again.

943
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:05,530
守衛 這位夫人要離開了
Guard! The lady is finished with me.

944
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:35,650
你叫什麼名字?
What's your name?

945
01:49:38,550 --> 01:49:40,240
朱利安克拉蘇
Julian Crassus.

946
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:46,990
名字?
Name?

947
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:49,790
馬可斯 陛下
Marcus, sire.

948
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:52,410
跟我父親同名
My father's name.

949
01:49:59,820 --> 01:50:02,070
他們在發現馬西墨斯逃走時
They must have known of Maximus' escape,

950
01:50:02,070 --> 01:50:05,010
一定可以找到他們四個的屍體
when they found the bodies of the four men.

951
01:50:05,370 --> 01:50:08,050
他們以為是野蠻人突襲
They thought it was a barbarian raid.

952
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,270
他們是好人 陛下 他們忠於皇上
These are good men, sire. Loyal to the Emperor.

953
01:50:19,510 --> 01:50:21,320
搭箭!
Load your arrows!

954
01:50:28,850 --> 01:50:30,870
準備放箭!
Prepare to fire!

955
01:50:51,290 --> 01:50:54,680
又或者是你知道...
Then perhaps it was you who knew,

956
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:57,230
而不告訴我
and never told me.

957
01:50:57,380 --> 01:50:59,730
- 我並不知道 - 你不知道?
- I didn't know. - You didn't know?

958
01:51:01,130 --> 01:51:04,070
但將軍永遠有控制權
But a general is always in control.

959
01:51:05,350 --> 01:51:09,120
永遠是命令者 不是嗎?
Always in command, isn't he?

960
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:12,120
是的 凱撒
Yes, Caesar.

961
01:51:25,950 --> 01:51:28,760
那下命令吧 快說
Then give the command. Say it.

962
01:51:45,550 --> 01:51:46,780
放箭
Fire.

963
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:23,360
馬西墨斯
Maximus.

964
01:52:24,010 --> 01:52:27,240
你指揮過軍團? 你打過很多勝仗?
You commanded legions? You had many victories?

965
01:52:28,010 --> 01:52:30,320
- 是的 - 在日耳曼?
- Yes. - In Germania?

966
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:33,990
在很多國家
In many countries.

967
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:36,910
將軍
General.

968
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:27,880
你已經出名了
You have a great name.

969
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:32,430
在殺你之前他得先羞辱你的名聲
He must kill your name before he kills you.

970
01:53:41,290 --> 01:53:42,710
沒錯
Yes, at the far end.

971
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:44,730
- 蓋爾斯議員 - 你好
- Senator Gaius. - Hello.

972
01:53:45,130 --> 01:53:47,190
格瑞克斯議員
Senator Gracchus.

973
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:52,180
很難得看見你出現在這種龍蛇混雜的地方
Don't often see you enjoying the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.

974
01:53:52,180 --> 01:53:55,390
我不會假裝和人民打成一片
I don't pretend to be a man of the people, Senator,

975
01:53:55,390 --> 01:53:58,030
但我會做個為人民說話的議員
but I do try to be a man for the people.

976
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:19,510
- 凱撒! 凱撒! 凱撒! 凱撒! - 凱撒! 凱撒! 凱撒! 凱撒!
- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! - Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

977
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:25,650
羅馬的人民!
People of Rome!

978
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:30,400
今天是安提俄克戰役的第四天
On the fourth day ofAntioch,

979
01:54:30,930 --> 01:54:35,410
同時也是競技慶典的第64天
we can celebrate the 64th day of the games.

980
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:40,280
在他的仁慈下
And in his majestic charity,

981
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:45,250
皇帝決定賜予羅馬人民...
the Emperor has deigned this day to favor the people of Rome

982
01:54:45,730 --> 01:54:49,250
一場歷史性的決戰
with an historical final match.

983
01:54:49,950 --> 01:54:54,630
在退休五年後...重回競技場
Returning to the Colosseum today, after five years in retirement,

984
01:54:55,950 --> 01:54:59,500
凱撒很高興為大家請到...
Caesar is pleased to bring you

985
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:03,370
羅馬歷史上...
the only undefeated champion

986
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:05,420
唯一的不敗冠軍...
in Roman history,

987
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:10,440
來自高盧的傳奇的底格里斯!
the legendary Tigris of Gaul!

988
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:35,160
他太清楚該如何操縱觀眾
He knows too well how to manipulate the mob.

989
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:37,950
馬可·奧勒留的夢想是建立一個全新的羅馬 普羅西莫
Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Rome, Proximo.

990
01:55:37,950 --> 01:55:40,830
但新羅馬不應該是這樣的!
This is not it. This is not it!

991
01:55:40,830 --> 01:55:43,760
馬可·奧勒留已經死了 馬西墨斯
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.

992
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:47,190
我們只是凡夫俗子 一切終歸塵土
We mortals are but shadows and dust.

993
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:49,960
一切終歸塵土 馬西墨斯
Shadows and dust, Maximus!

994
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:53,930
讓我們隆重介紹...
Representing the training lyceum ofAntonius Proximo,

995
01:55:53,930 --> 01:55:57,680
代表普羅西莫訓練會館的...
Caesar is proud to give you

996
01:55:57,680 --> 01:56:01,620
馬西墨斯!
Aelius Maximus!

997
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:16,780
他們把他當成自己人 敞開雙臂歡迎他
They embrace him like he's one of their own.

998
01:56:16,780 --> 01:56:20,800
觀眾是很善變的 弟弟 不出一個月就會忘記他的
The mob is fickle, brother. He'll be forgotten in a month.

999
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:26,390
錯了 用不了那麼久
No, much sooner than that.

1000
01:56:28,210 --> 01:56:30,100
一切都安排好了
It's been arranged.

1001
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:51,580
角鬥士向你致敬
We who are about to die salute you.

1002
01:56:54,820 --> 01:56:56,710
我們支持你 馬西墨斯!
We're with you, Maximus!

1003
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:41,090
打敗他!
Fight on, finish it!

1004
01:58:09,230 --> 01:58:11,000
用力拉!
Pull, pull!

1005
01:58:43,260 --> 01:58:44,900
放開! 放開!
Loose! Loose!

1006
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:15,100
- 殺了他! - 殺!
- Gut him! - Kill!

1007
01:59:16,460 --> 01:59:20,150
- 殺! 殺! 殺! 殺! - 殺! 殺! 殺! 殺!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! - Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

1008
01:59:40,490 --> 01:59:42,630
- 殺! - 殺!
- Kill! - Kill!

1009
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:22,710
仁慈的馬西墨斯!
Maximus the Merciful!

1010
02:00:31,790 --> 02:00:37,640
- 馬西墨斯! 馬西墨斯! 馬西墨斯! - 馬西墨斯! 馬西墨斯! 馬西墨斯!
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! - Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1011
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:47,490
衛兵 前進 攻擊隊形!
Forward, arms at ready!

1012
02:01:17,370 --> 02:01:19,850
我該拿你怎麼辦?
What am I going to do with you?

1013
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:24,480
為什麼你...不去死
You simply won't die.

1014
02:01:29,140 --> 02:01:31,610
我們之間的差異真有這麼大嗎?
Are we so different, you and I?

1015
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:35,660
必要時你也殺人...就像我一樣
You take life when you have to, as I do.

1016
02:01:36,940 --> 02:01:40,700
只剩下一個人我非殺不可 然後我的責任就完成了
I have only one more life to take. Then it is done.

1017
02:01:41,150 --> 02:01:43,000
那現在就動手啊
Then take it now.

1018
02:01:55,950 --> 02:01:58,060
他們告訴我你兒子...
They tell me your son

1019
02:01:58,750 --> 02:02:02,770
在被釘上十字架的時候...象女孩子一樣在尖叫
squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross.

1020
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:06,560
還有你妻子...
And your wife

1021
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:09,730
在被他們蹂躪的時候...
moaned like a whore

1022
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:15,410
象妓女一樣在呻吟...
when they ravaged her again and again

1023
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:18,160
一次又一次...呻吟著
and again.

1024
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:27,170
你呼風喚雨的日子很快就要結束了
The time for honoring yourself will soon be at an end,

1025
02:02:31,660 --> 02:02:33,130
陛下
Highness.

1026
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:06,460
將軍!
General! General!

1027
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:10,290
- 將軍! - 西斯洛!
- General! - Cicero!

1028
02:03:17,660 --> 02:03:19,250
- 將軍! - 軍隊在哪裡紮營?
- General! - Where are you camped?

1029
02:03:19,250 --> 02:03:20,640
在奧斯亞
Ostia.

1030
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,050
- 我們愛你 馬西墨斯! - 讚美勝利者!
- We love you, Maximus! - Praise the victor!

1031
02:03:30,050 --> 02:03:32,650
告訴大家我還活著 來找我
Tell the men their general lives. Find me.

1032
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:34,610
- 快走! - 來找我!
- Move along! - Find me!

1033
02:04:00,370 --> 02:04:02,430
他們可以聽到你的祈禱嗎?
Can they hear you?

1034
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:09,520
- 誰? - 你在黃泉的家人
- Who? - Your family, in the afterlife.

1035
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:14,360
- 會的 - 你跟他們說什麼?
- Yes. - What do you say to them?

1036
02:04:18,140 --> 02:04:19,700
對我的兒子
To my boy,

1037
02:04:21,430 --> 02:04:24,060
我告訴他我們很快就能見面了
I tell him I will see him again soon,

1038
02:04:24,060 --> 02:04:27,750
騎馬的時候記得腳跟要壓低點
and to keep his heels down when he's riding his horse.

1039
02:04:28,940 --> 02:04:30,540
對我妻子...
To my wife,

1040
02:04:32,940 --> 02:04:35,170
那不關你的事
that is not your business.

1041
02:04:42,750 --> 02:04:45,720
現在觀眾反而敬愛馬西墨斯的仁慈
And now they love Maximus for his mercy.

1042
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:50,640
因此我更不能殺他 不然就會顯得我更殘暴
So I can'tjust kill him, or it makes me even more unmerciful.

1043
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:56,230
這整件事簡直就像場惡夢
The whole thing is like some great nightmare.

1044
02:04:57,390 --> 02:04:59,300
他是在公然向你挑戰
He is defying you.

1045
02:04:59,300 --> 02:05:02,770
他每一次的勝利都是種反抗的舉動
His every victory is an act of defiance.

1046
02:05:02,770 --> 02:05:06,450
觀眾和元老院議員們都看到了
The mob sees this, and so do the Senate.

1047
02:05:07,150 --> 02:05:10,120
只要他存在一天 他們就會越來越大膽
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.

1048
02:05:11,570 --> 02:05:13,420
- 殺了他 - 不行
- Kill him. - No.

1049
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:17,760
我不會幫他成為烈士
I will not make a martyr of him.

1050
02:05:24,790 --> 02:05:27,330
我今天去國會...
When I went to the Senate today,

1051
02:05:27,330 --> 02:05:31,890
特意告訴他們 我用了穀物貯備來支付競技賽
I purposefully told them about using the grain reserves to pay for the games.

1052
02:05:33,710 --> 02:05:35,970
你記得發生什麼事嗎?
And did you note what happened?

1053
02:05:35,970 --> 02:05:39,280
- 沒什麼 - 對 什麼都沒發生
- Nothing. - Exactly. Nothing.

1054
02:05:40,180 --> 02:05:42,600
一句抗議都沒有
Not a single word of protest.

1055
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:46,310
連傲慢的格瑞克斯議員也沒出聲
Even the insolent Senator Gracchus was silent as a mouse.

1056
02:05:46,310 --> 02:05:47,580
為什麼?
Why?

1057
02:05:49,190 --> 02:05:52,980
我聽說有一種海蛇
I have been told of a certain sea snake

1058
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:57,130
用非常特別的方法來誘捕獵物
which has a very unusual method of attracting its prey.

1059
02:05:57,490 --> 02:06:01,300
它會假裝受傷 躺在海底
It will lie at the bottom of the ocean as ifwounded.

1060
02:06:01,380 --> 02:06:02,160
然後敵人接近...

1061
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:04,580
接著它的敵人會漸漸的靠近
Then its enemies will approach,

1062
02:06:04,580 --> 02:06:07,760
它會繼續躺著不動
and yet it will lie quite still.

1063
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,880
接著敵人會開始慢慢的咬它
And then its enemies will take little bites of it,

1064
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:15,270
但它還是...一動不動
and yet it remains still.

1065
02:06:18,380 --> 02:06:19,650
那麼
So,

1066
02:06:20,890 --> 02:06:22,780
我們要不動聲色...
we will lie still,

1067
02:06:23,390 --> 02:06:26,820
耐心等待我們的敵人上鉤
and let our enemies come to us and nibble.

1068
02:06:27,890 --> 02:06:30,240
讓所有的議員也自投羅網
Have every senator followed.

1069
02:06:47,790 --> 02:06:49,620
西斯洛 我的老朋友
Cicero, my old friend.

1070
02:06:49,620 --> 02:06:51,580
我以為再也見不到你了
I thought perhaps I'd seen you for the last time.

1071
02:06:51,580 --> 02:06:54,210
- 我以為你死了 - 差不多
- I thought you were dead. - Close.

1072
02:06:54,210 --> 02:06:55,920
軍團駐紮在奧斯亞有多久了?
How long have the men been in Ostia?

1073
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:57,350
整個冬季
All winter.

1074
02:06:57,590 --> 02:07:00,980
- 他們的狀況如何? ? - 整天吃飽了 無所事事
- And how do they look? - Fat and bored.

1075
02:07:01,590 --> 02:07:04,740
- 指揮官是誰? - 從羅馬來的白癡
- Who's in command? - Some fool from Rome.

1076
02:07:06,260 --> 02:07:08,180
他們最快要什麼時候才能準備好?
How soon do you think they could be ready to fight?

1077
02:07:08,180 --> 02:07:10,080
為了你 明天
For you, tomorrow.

1078
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:14,040
有件事我需要你幫忙
I need you to do something for me.

1079
02:07:18,570 --> 02:07:20,070
各位 快來看
Come, see, witness.

1080
02:07:20,070 --> 02:07:23,200
如果你沒去競技場的話 你能在這裡看見當時的情景
If you haven't been in the arena, you can see the show here.

1081
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:26,910
馬西墨斯快要打敗我們的皇帝康莫德斯了 我們該怎麼辦?
Giant Maximus is defeating our emperor, Commodus.

1082
02:07:26,910 --> 02:07:29,620
他藐視每一個人
What are we to do? He's just defying everyone,

1083
02:07:29,620 --> 02:07:31,390
我們該怎麼辦?
by doing this to him, they do...

1084
02:07:32,540 --> 02:07:33,970
啊! 我的天啊!
My goodness!

1085
02:07:35,670 --> 02:07:39,350
- 他贏了! - 讓路!
- He got him, he's defeated. - Give way!

1086
02:07:45,350 --> 02:07:48,010
公主陛下? 我在凡度巴納侍奉過你父親
My lady? I served your father at Vindobona.

1087
02:07:48,010 --> 02:07:49,640
- 退後 - 我的夫人
- Back. - My lady.

1088
02:07:49,640 --> 02:07:52,140
我在凡度巴納服侍過你父親
I served your father at Vindobona.

1089
02:07:52,140 --> 02:07:53,310
退後!
Back!

1090
02:07:53,310 --> 02:07:56,620
我也服侍過馬西墨斯將軍 我現在還為他服務
And I served General Maximus. I serve him still.

1091
02:07:58,020 --> 02:07:59,710
停下來
Stop. Stop.

1092
02:08:00,150 --> 02:08:01,420
停!
Stop!

1093
02:08:02,240 --> 02:08:03,750
退下
Stand back.

1094
02:08:04,950 --> 02:08:08,090
將軍讓我帶個口信 他願意見你說的政治家
The general sends word, he will meet your politician.

1095
02:08:09,700 --> 02:08:13,100
- 士兵 獎賞你的忠誠 - 謝謝 夫人
- For your loyalty, soldier. - Thank you, my lady.

1096
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:24,190
出去吧
Leave us.

1097
02:08:29,810 --> 02:08:31,620
格瑞克斯議員
Senator Gracchus.

1098
02:08:45,320 --> 02:08:46,710
將軍
General.

1099
02:08:47,700 --> 02:08:50,530
我希望今天我來這裡能夠...
I hope my coming here today is evidence enough

1100
02:08:50,540 --> 02:08:53,720
使你信任我
that you can trust me.

1101
02:08:57,920 --> 02:09:00,480
- 元老院和你的立場一致? - 元老院?
- The Senate is with you? - The Senate?

1102
02:09:01,880 --> 02:09:04,690
是的 我能代表他們
Yes. I can speak for them.

1103
02:09:05,220 --> 02:09:08,650
你能幫我獲得自由偷偷把我運出羅馬嗎?
You can buy my freedom and smuggle me out of Rome?

1104
02:09:08,930 --> 02:09:10,490
你打算幹什麼?
To what end?

1105
02:09:11,850 --> 02:09:14,280
把我送到城外去
Get me outside the city walls.

1106
02:09:14,770 --> 02:09:18,730
準備好馬匹讓我去奧斯亞 我的軍隊在那裡紮營
Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia. My army is encamped there.

1107
02:09:18,730 --> 02:09:22,150
我會在第二天傍晚率領五千名士兵回來
By nightfall of the second day, I shall return at the head of 5, 000 men.

1108
02:09:22,150 --> 02:09:24,480
但軍團的新指揮官
But the legions all have new commanders,

1109
02:09:24,490 --> 02:09:25,990
全都效忠於康莫德斯
loyal to Commodus.

1110
02:09:25,990 --> 02:09:29,240
只要我的部下看到我還活你就知道他們效忠誰了
Let my men see me alive, and you shall see where their loyalties lie.

1111
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:31,010
簡直太瘋狂了
This is madness.

1112
02:09:31,580 --> 02:09:35,000
百年來羅馬軍隊從未進入過首都
No Roman army has entered the capital in 100 years.

1113
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,330
我不願意引狼入室!
I will not trade one dictatorship for another!

1114
02:09:37,330 --> 02:09:40,980
議員 已經沒時間商量權宜辦法了
The time for half measures and talk is over, Senator.

1115
02:09:41,420 --> 02:09:44,600
在你光榮的政變之後又將如何?
And after your glorious coup, what then?

1116
02:09:45,720 --> 02:09:49,430
你會帶著五千名士兵離開羅馬?
You'll take your 5, 000 warriors and leave?

1117
02:09:49,430 --> 02:09:51,070
我會離開
I will leave.

1118
02:09:51,470 --> 02:09:53,600
士兵們會留下來保護你們
The soldiers will stay for your protection,

1119
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:55,370
受元老院的指揮
under the command of the Senate.

1120
02:09:55,390 --> 02:09:56,660
換言之
So,

1121
02:09:56,890 --> 02:10:01,200
一旦羅馬被你控制以後...你會將它交還給人民?
once all of Rome is yours, you'll just give it back to the people?

1122
02:10:02,480 --> 02:10:03,580
告訴我原因
Tell me why.

1123
02:10:09,610 --> 02:10:12,880
因為那是某人臨死前最後的期望
Because that was the last wish of a dying man.

1124
02:10:15,830 --> 02:10:17,800
我會殺了康莫德斯
I will kill Commodus.

1125
02:10:19,620 --> 02:10:22,810
羅馬的命運就交給你了
The fate of Rome I leave to you.

1126
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:26,860
馬可·奧勒留信任你
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1127
02:10:28,590 --> 02:10:30,730
他的女兒信任你
His daughter trusts you.

1128
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:36,410
我也會信任你
I will trust you.

1129
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:38,870
但我們時間緊迫
But we have little time.

1130
02:10:39,310 --> 02:10:41,160
給我兩天時間...
Give me two days,

1131
02:10:41,850 --> 02:10:44,210
我會想辦法使你獲得自由
and I will buy your freedom.

1132
02:10:44,730 --> 02:10:46,170
而你...
And you,

1133
02:10:47,610 --> 02:10:49,290
你千萬要活下去
you stay alive,

1134
02:10:50,700 --> 02:10:52,460
否則我就死定了
or I'll be dead.

1135
02:10:54,330 --> 02:10:56,010
我們得走了
Now we must go.

1136
02:11:22,980 --> 02:11:26,650
他會在等你 站在鬥獸場腳下
He'll be waiting for you. Stand at the foot of the colossus.

1137
02:11:26,650 --> 02:11:28,330
他會找到你
He'll find you.

1138
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:13,960
不可能成功的
It won't work.

1139
02:12:14,820 --> 02:12:17,050
皇帝對一切都瞭如指掌
The Emperor knows too much.

1140
02:12:17,700 --> 02:12:18,800
對我來說...
And as for me,

1141
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:23,180
形勢越來越危險了
it's becoming dangerous.

1142
02:12:24,370 --> 02:12:26,730
我回來後會酬謝你的
You'll be paid on my return.

1143
02:12:28,710 --> 02:12:30,600
我向你保證
I give you my word.

1144
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:33,940
保證? 你不回來的話怎麼辦呢
Your word? What if you don't return?

1145
02:12:35,090 --> 02:12:38,140
你還記得信任別人的感覺嗎 普羅西莫?
Do you remember what it was to have trust, Proximo?

1146
02:12:38,140 --> 02:12:39,490
信任?
Trust?

1147
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:45,490
有誰值得我信任?
Who am I to trust?

1148
02:12:45,980 --> 02:12:49,250
- 我會殺死康莫德斯 - 對我有什麼好處?
- I will kill Commodus. - Why would I want that?

1149
02:12:49,940 --> 02:12:51,750
他給我帶來財富
He makes me rich.

1150
02:12:56,780 --> 02:12:59,720
我知道你是個信守承諾的人 將軍
I know that you are a man of your word, General.

1151
02:13:01,370 --> 02:13:04,050
我也知道你願意為榮譽而死
I know that you would die for honor.

1152
02:13:05,290 --> 02:13:07,350
你願意為羅馬而犧牲
You would die for Rome.

1153
02:13:08,290 --> 02:13:11,500
願意為祖先的名譽而死
You would die for the memory of your ancestors.

1154
02:13:11,500 --> 02:13:13,900
但我 換個角度說...
But I, on the other hand,

1155
02:13:16,510 --> 02:13:18,440
我不過是個表演藝人
I'm an entertainer.

1156
02:13:21,850 --> 02:13:23,160
守衛!
Guard!

1157
02:13:27,900 --> 02:13:30,580
他殺了還你自由的那個人
He killed the man who set you free.

1158
02:13:39,660 --> 02:13:41,590
大人 是禁衛軍
Praetorians, master.

1159
02:13:47,670 --> 02:13:48,930
停!
Halt!

1160
02:14:53,980 --> 02:14:55,870
你去哪裡了?
Where have you been?

1161
02:14:56,230 --> 02:14:57,920
我派人去找你
I sent for you.

1162
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:01,170
弟弟 別疑神疑鬼了
Please, brother.

1163
02:15:06,830 --> 02:15:08,800
什麼事讓你煩心?
What's troubling you?

1164
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:13,600
格瑞克斯是不是有了新愛人?
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

1165
02:15:15,290 --> 02:15:16,900
我不知道
I don't know.

1166
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:21,020
我以為你見過他
I thought you'd seen him.

1167
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:24,360
他像傷寒一樣影響著每個人
He infects everyone like a putrid fever.

1168
02:15:26,100 --> 02:15:29,410
為羅馬著想 必須要犧牲元老院
For the health of Rome, the Senate must be bled.

1169
02:15:29,730 --> 02:15:31,870
他也不能倖免
And he will bleed, too.

1170
02:15:32,650 --> 02:15:34,120
時機成熟了
Very soon.

1171
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:37,290
不要選在今晚
But not tonight.

1172
02:15:52,210 --> 02:15:55,230
還記得父親曾說過的話嗎?
Do you remember what our father said once?

1173
02:15:56,460 --> 02:15:58,230
"一場夢...
"It's a dream,

1174
02:16:00,010 --> 02:16:02,020
生活就是...
"a frightful dream,

1175
02:16:04,470 --> 02:16:05,900
一場噩夢"
"life is."

1176
02:16:08,510 --> 02:16:10,700
你覺得他說的對嗎?
Do you think that's true?

1177
02:16:11,350 --> 02:16:12,950
我不知道
I don't know.

1178
02:16:16,440 --> 02:16:18,080
我認為是真的
I think it is.

1179
02:16:20,740 --> 02:16:23,590
而我只能和你分享
And I have only you to share it with.

1180
02:17:01,070 --> 02:17:02,790
張開嘴
Open your mouth.

1181
02:17:39,980 --> 02:17:41,870
你知道我愛你
You know I love you.

1182
02:17:43,860 --> 02:17:45,540
我也愛你
And I love you.

1183
02:18:22,110 --> 02:18:23,750
出去 滾出去!
Out. Get out!

1184
02:18:24,860 --> 02:18:26,210
快點!
Move!

1185
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:32,910
恭喜你 將軍
Congratulations, General.

1186
02:18:32,910 --> 02:18:35,800
你的朋友很擅於說服別人
You've got very persuasive friends.

1187
02:18:41,710 --> 02:18:44,290
我弟弟已經逮捕了格瑞克斯
My brother has had Gracchus arrested.

1188
02:18:44,300 --> 02:18:47,840
我們不能再等下去了 今晚一定得離開
We daren't wait any longer. We must leave tonight.

1189
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:51,570
普羅西莫半夜會來把你帶到大門口
Proximo will come at midnight and take you to the gate.

1190
02:18:52,140 --> 02:18:55,910
你的僕人 西斯洛 會帶著馬在那邊等你
Your servant, Cicero, will be waiting there with horses.

1191
02:18:57,810 --> 02:19:00,200
- 你一個人安排這一切的嗎? - 是
- You have done all this? - Yes.

1192
02:19:01,310 --> 02:19:03,120
你太冒險了
You risk too much.

1193
02:19:03,980 --> 02:19:06,080
我有太多的債要還
I have much to pay for.

1194
02:19:08,400 --> 02:19:10,700
你並沒有虧欠任何人
You have nothing to pay for.

1195
02:19:10,700 --> 02:19:13,880
你愛你的兒子 為了他 你變得十分堅強
You love your son. You're strong for him.

1196
02:19:16,990 --> 02:19:19,430
我已經厭倦了
I am tired of being strong.

1197
02:19:21,290 --> 02:19:25,600
我弟弟憎恨全世界 尤其是你
My brother hates all the world, and you most of all.

1198
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:29,230
- 因為你父親選了我 - 不
- Because your father chose me. - No.

1199
02:19:30,420 --> 02:19:32,780
因為我父親愛你
Because my father loved you.

1200
02:19:36,600 --> 02:19:39,120
而我也愛你
And because I loved you.

1201
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:43,370
很久以前的事了
A long time ago.

1202
02:19:48,030 --> 02:19:50,250
我變了很多嗎?
Was I very different then?

1203
02:19:56,700 --> 02:19:58,550
你以前比較愛笑
You laughed more.

1204
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:05,060
我一直都覺得很寂寞
I have felt alone all my life,

1205
02:20:06,250 --> 02:20:08,020
除了跟你一起時
except with you.

1206
02:20:11,010 --> 02:20:12,480
我要走了
I must go.

1207
02:20:13,050 --> 02:20:14,280
是的
Yes.

1208
02:20:42,660 --> 02:20:43,970
那裡
There.

1209
02:20:55,430 --> 02:20:57,030
我贏了
And I got you.

1210
02:20:59,970 --> 02:21:01,970
現在玩士兵打仗不會晚了點嗎?
Isn't it late to be playing legionnaire?

1211
02:21:01,970 --> 02:21:04,160
我不是士兵
I'm not a legionnaire.

1212
02:21:04,390 --> 02:21:07,080
- 不是士兵? - 我是角鬥士
- Not a legionnaire? - I'm a gladiator.

1213
02:21:08,270 --> 02:21:09,830
角鬥士?
A gladiator?

1214
02:21:10,440 --> 02:21:13,190
角鬥士只在競技場裡打鬥
Gladiators only fight in the games.

1215
02:21:13,190 --> 02:21:16,700
難道你不想像凱撒朱利葉...那樣當一名出色的羅馬戰士?
Wouldrt you rather be a great Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?

1216
02:21:16,700 --> 02:21:19,380
我是馬西墨斯 羅馬的救世主!
I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!

1217
02:21:22,120 --> 02:21:24,050
羅馬的救世主?
The savior of Rome?

1218
02:21:31,960 --> 02:21:33,770
是誰說的?
And who said that?

1219
02:21:42,510 --> 02:21:44,200
盧修斯在哪裡?
Where's Lucius?

1220
02:21:45,310 --> 02:21:47,830
他和皇帝在一起 夫人
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

1221
02:21:50,650 --> 02:21:52,440
- 她不可能那樣做 - 不 是真的
- She couldn't. - Yes, she did.

1222
02:21:52,440 --> 02:21:54,750
她在籃中拿出來...
She took it from a basket,

1223
02:21:56,070 --> 02:21:59,920
她從籃子裡拿出來 把它放在胸口 就在她心臟的正上方
and pressed it to her breast, right here above her heart.

1224
02:22:01,450 --> 02:22:04,760
- 它咬在她的胸口上? - 是的
- It bit her in the breast? - Yes.

1225
02:22:05,330 --> 02:22:09,390
你知道嗎? 盧修斯 有時候那些皇室的小姐們...
You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies

1226
02:22:09,790 --> 02:22:13,840
為了愛可以做出一些非常奇怪的事來
behave very strangely and do very odd things in the name of love.

1227
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:16,520
- 我覺得這樣做很愚蠢 - 我也這麼想
- I think it's silly. - So do I.

1228
02:22:18,510 --> 02:22:19,940
我也這麼想
So do I.

1229
02:22:20,390 --> 02:22:22,570
姐姐 過來加入我們
Sister, join us.

1230
02:22:23,100 --> 02:22:24,930
我在念故事給盧修斯聽
I've been reading to dear Lucius.

1231
02:22:24,930 --> 02:22:27,020
- 我也在讀 - 沒錯
- I've been reading, too. - Yes.

1232
02:22:27,020 --> 02:22:31,450
他是個非常機靈的小男孩 總有一天他會成為了不起的皇帝的
He's a very clever little boy. He'll make a grand emperor one day.

1233
02:22:32,900 --> 02:22:35,400
我們在讀偉大的安東尼
We've been reading about the great Mark Antony,

1234
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:36,820
和他在埃及的冒險
and his adventures in Egypt.

1235
02:22:36,820 --> 02:22:39,450
還有皇后用蛇自殺的故事
And the queen killed herself with a snake.

1236
02:22:39,450 --> 02:22:42,870
我還沒告訴你發生在我們祖先身上的故事
And just wait until you hear what happened to our ancestors.

1237
02:22:42,870 --> 02:22:44,780
如果你很乖的話
If you're very good,

1238
02:22:44,790 --> 02:22:48,660
明晚我會給你講克勞迪亞斯皇帝的故事
tomorrow night, I'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius.

1239
02:22:48,660 --> 02:22:50,470
他身邊最親近的人...
He was betrayed

1240
02:22:51,580 --> 02:22:53,810
背叛了他
by those closest to him.

1241
02:22:55,590 --> 02:22:57,440
他的親人
By his own blood.

1242
02:22:58,670 --> 02:23:01,220
他們在黑暗的角落裡商議...
They whispered in dark corners

1243
02:23:01,220 --> 02:23:03,760
並且在半夜偷偷出去...
and went out late at night,

1244
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:07,200
共同密謀...
and conspired, and conspired.

1245
02:23:09,730 --> 02:23:13,660
但皇帝知道他們在策劃陰謀
But the Emperor Claudius knew that they were up to something.

1246
02:23:13,690 --> 02:23:16,330
他知道象小蜜蜂一樣忙碌
He knew they were busy little bees.

1247
02:23:18,190 --> 02:23:21,340
有天晚上 他和其中一人談話...
And one night he sat down with one of them,

1248
02:23:22,030 --> 02:23:24,130
他看著她...
and he looked at her,

1249
02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:26,430
然後說...
and he said,

1250
02:23:27,490 --> 02:23:30,180
"告訴我你們的計劃...
"Tell me what you've been doing,

1251
02:23:30,750 --> 02:23:32,560
忙碌的小蜜蜂
"busy little bee.

1252
02:23:34,750 --> 02:23:37,940
不然我會殺死你最親的人...
"Or I shall strike down those dearest to you.

1253
02:23:39,010 --> 02:23:42,150
你會看到我身上沾滿他們的鮮血"
"You shall watch as I bathe in their blood."

1254
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:48,280
而皇帝的心都碎了
And the Emperor was heartbroken.

1255
02:23:50,270 --> 02:23:52,560
小蜜蜂對他的傷害
The little bee had wounded him more deeply

1256
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:55,370
比任何人都要深
than anyone else could ever have done.

1257
02:23:57,400 --> 02:24:00,380
盧修斯 你認為接下來會發生什麼事?
What do you think happened then, Lucius?

1258
02:24:00,900 --> 02:24:02,840
我不知道 舅舅
I don't know, Uncle.

1259
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:11,930
小蜜蜂告訴了他所有的事
The little bee told him everything.

1260
02:25:09,720 --> 02:25:12,820
開閘 皇上有令!
Open, in the name of the Emperor!

1261
02:25:13,560 --> 02:25:14,950
普羅西莫!
Proximo!

1262
02:25:15,730 --> 02:25:18,950
開門 我們是奉皇帝的命令來的!
Open the gates, in the name of the Emperor!

1263
02:25:19,690 --> 02:25:21,120
普羅西莫!

1264
02:25:23,240 --> 02:25:24,790
奉皇帝的命令 開門!
Open the gates!

1265
02:25:30,530 --> 02:25:32,930
快開門 普羅西莫!
Open the gates, Proximo.

1266
02:25:33,290 --> 02:25:35,640
老頭 你想找死嗎?
Do you want to die, old man?

1267
02:25:36,750 --> 02:25:37,970
拿去
Here.

1268
02:25:38,460 --> 02:25:40,710
一切準備好了
Everything is prepared.

1269
02:25:40,710 --> 02:25:43,250
看來你贏得你的自由了
It seems you have won your freedom.

1270
02:25:43,260 --> 02:25:46,940
普羅西莫 當個好人是否會替你惹上麻煩
Proximo, are you in danger of becoming a good man?

1271
02:25:51,930 --> 02:25:55,870
- 裘巴 - 反抗皇帝的人都得死!
- Juba. - All enemies of the Emperor die!

1272
02:25:56,310 --> 02:25:58,580
開門! 皇帝的命令!
Open the gates!

1273
02:26:03,980 --> 02:26:06,040
用力拉!
Pull!

1274
02:26:08,070 --> 02:26:11,050
沖! 兩隊人去左邊!
Move! Form a column on the left!

1275
02:26:14,750 --> 02:26:18,040
我只需要機會脫身 千萬別做無謂的犧牲
I only need moments, so do not be careless with your lives.

1276
02:26:18,040 --> 02:26:20,580
不想被捲入這事的 就回到囚室裡去
If you don't want any part of this, go back to your cells.

1277
02:26:20,580 --> 02:26:22,920
我們會留在這裡幫你 馬西墨斯
We'll wait here for you, Maximus.

1278
02:26:22,920 --> 02:26:24,800
- 勇氣和榮譽 - 勇氣和榮譽
- Strength and honor. - Strength and honor.

1279
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:25,940
去吧
Go.

1280
02:26:26,720 --> 02:26:28,650
勇氣和榮譽
Strength and honor.

1281
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:34,110
瞄準 拉弓!
Aim. Arch your bows!

1282
02:27:25,030 --> 02:27:26,650
馬可·奧勒留914-922

1283
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:30,760
普羅西莫

1284
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:42,520
一切終歸塵土
Shadows and dust.

1285
02:28:24,330 --> 02:28:25,680
馬西墨斯!
Maximus!

1286
02:28:31,050 --> 02:28:32,570
對不起
I'm sorry.

1287
02:28:58,870 --> 02:29:00,340
事情都解決了
It's done.

1288
02:29:07,210 --> 02:29:09,180
該如何處治我的外甥?
And what of my nephew?

1289
02:29:10,170 --> 02:29:12,270
還有他的母親?
And what of his mother?

1290
02:29:14,260 --> 02:29:16,900
他們應該面對和她愛人相同的命運嗎?
Should they share her lover's fate?

1291
02:29:18,510 --> 02:29:20,650
還是我應該網開一面?
Or should I be merciful?

1292
02:29:23,270 --> 02:29:25,280
仁慈的康莫德斯
Commodus the Merciful.

1293
02:29:31,610 --> 02:29:34,040
從現在起 盧修斯由我照顧
Lucius will stay with me now.

1294
02:29:35,110 --> 02:29:37,000
如果他母親...
And if his mother

1295
02:29:38,280 --> 02:29:40,510
用令我不快的眼神看著我...
so much as looks at me

1296
02:29:41,580 --> 02:29:44,180
用令我不快的態度對我...
in a manner that displeases me,

1297
02:29:46,040 --> 02:29:47,560
他就會死
he will die.

1298
02:29:50,960 --> 02:29:54,310
如果她想...抵死不從...
If she decides to be noble,

1299
02:29:55,970 --> 02:29:58,150
或者想自殺的話...
and takes her own life,

1300
02:29:59,640 --> 02:30:01,200
他會死
he will die.

1301
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:06,530
至於你...
And as for you,

1302
02:30:09,230 --> 02:30:11,080
你會愛我...
you will love me,

1303
02:30:11,820 --> 02:30:13,710
就像我愛你一樣
as I have loved you.

1304
02:30:15,190 --> 02:30:18,960
你會幫我生育下一代 血統純正的繼承人...
You will provide me with an heir of pure blood,

1305
02:30:19,820 --> 02:30:21,760
那麼康莫德斯
so that Commodus

1306
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:25,300
和他的子孫...將世世代代統治羅馬
and his progeny will rule for 1, 000 years.

1307
02:30:29,830 --> 02:30:31,680
我不夠仁慈嗎?
Am I not merciful?

1308
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:56,170
我不夠仁慈嗎?
Am I not merciful!

1309
02:31:08,290 --> 02:31:12,390
- 馬西墨斯! 馬西墨斯! 馬西墨斯! - 馬西墨斯! 馬西墨斯! 馬西墨斯!
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! - Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1310
02:31:39,740 --> 02:31:42,590
我是軍人 我職責是服從
I'm a soldier. I obey.

1311
02:31:45,240 --> 02:31:49,600
沒人可以逼你做你不願意的事
Nothing happens to anyone that he is not fitted by nature to bear.

1312
02:32:22,450 --> 02:32:28,510
馬西墨斯!
Maximus.

1313
02:32:30,120 --> 02:32:32,050
他們在為你歡呼
They call for you.

1314
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:37,270
一個淪為奴隸的將軍
The general who became a slave.

1315
02:32:38,420 --> 02:32:40,900
一個變成角鬥士的奴隸
The slave who became a gladiator.

1316
02:32:42,170 --> 02:32:45,070
一個挑戰皇帝的角鬥士
The gladiator who defied an emperor.

1317
02:32:46,970 --> 02:32:48,740
一個震撼人心的故事
A striking story.

1318
02:32:49,810 --> 02:32:53,120
現在人們想知道故事的結局
Now the people want to know how the story ends.

1319
02:32:55,400 --> 02:32:57,750
只有一個出名的死亡才能令人滿意
Only a famous death will do.

1320
02:32:59,570 --> 02:33:02,210
還有什麼能比...
And what could be more glorious

1321
02:33:02,490 --> 02:33:06,340
在競技場上親自挑戰皇帝來的光榮呢?
than to challenge the Emperor himself in the great arena?

1322
02:33:08,580 --> 02:33:11,720
- 你要和我決鬥? - 為什麼不?
- You would fight me? - Why not?

1323
02:33:12,700 --> 02:33:14,850
你以為我害怕嗎?
Do you think I'm afraid?

1324
02:33:15,670 --> 02:33:18,790
我認為你一生人也在害怕
I think you have been afraid all your life.

1325
02:33:18,790 --> 02:33:22,600
不像無敵的馬西墨斯 有誰從來不害怕?
Unlike Maximus the Invincible, who knows no fear?

1326
02:33:28,260 --> 02:33:31,740
一個我認識的人曾經說過 "死亡向所有人微笑...
I knew a man who once said, "Death smiles at us all.

1327
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:35,120
人們所能做的就是還以微笑"
"All a man can do is smile back."

1328
02:33:36,810 --> 02:33:38,330
我在懷疑
I wonder,

1329
02:33:38,860 --> 02:33:41,750
你的朋友在面對死亡時也在微笑嗎?
did your friend smile at his own death?

1330
02:33:42,030 --> 02:33:43,630
你要知道
You must know.

1331
02:33:46,450 --> 02:33:48,340
他是你父親
He was your father.

1332
02:33:52,120 --> 02:33:54,550
我知道 你愛我的父親
You loved my father, I know,

1333
02:33:55,960 --> 02:33:57,560
但我也愛他
but so did I.

1334
02:33:59,080 --> 02:34:01,770
我們因此是兄弟 不是嗎?
That makes us brothers, doesn't it?

1335
02:34:04,300 --> 02:34:05,980
兄弟 對我微笑吧
Smile for me now, brother.

1336
02:34:11,890 --> 02:34:14,820
替他穿上盔甲 把傷口遮住
Strap on his armor. Conceal the wound.

1337
02:35:09,150 --> 02:35:11,210
成包圍隊形!
Ring formation!

1338
02:37:02,890 --> 02:37:04,620
昆塔斯 劍
Quintus, sword.

1339
02:37:06,020 --> 02:37:07,910
把你的劍給我!
Give me your sword.

1340
02:37:11,230 --> 02:37:13,340
劍! 給我把劍!
Sword! Give me a sword!

1341
02:37:14,740 --> 02:37:18,340
收劍入鞘! 收劍入鞘!
Sheathe your swords. Sheathe your swords!

1342
02:39:33,710 --> 02:39:36,320
馬西墨斯
Maximus.

1343
02:39:42,300 --> 02:39:43,740
昆塔斯
Quintus.

1344
02:39:45,300 --> 02:39:46,860
還我的人自由
Free my men.

1345
02:39:48,140 --> 02:39:50,950
恢復格瑞克斯議員的職位
Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated.

1346
02:39:52,150 --> 02:39:54,330
羅馬的共和是個夢想
There was a dream that was Rome.

1347
02:39:54,900 --> 02:39:56,870
它應當被實現
It shall be realized.

1348
02:39:57,320 --> 02:40:00,000
這些都是馬可·奧勒留的心願
These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius.

1349
02:40:00,990 --> 02:40:03,090
釋放囚犯 快去
Free the prisoners. Go!

1350
02:40:27,760 --> 02:40:29,200
馬西墨斯
Maximus.

1351
02:40:30,980 --> 02:40:32,660
盧修斯安全了
Lucius is safe.

1352
02:40:48,870 --> 02:40:50,390
去找他們吧
Go to them.

1353
02:41:40,090 --> 02:41:41,600
你回到家了
You're home.

1354
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:10,800
羅馬值得一個好人犧牲性命嗎?
Is Rome won'th one good mars life?

1355
02:42:14,580 --> 02:42:16,470
我們曾經相信
We believed it once.

1356
02:42:19,580 --> 02:42:21,810
那就讓我們再次相信吧
Make us believe it again.

1357
02:42:25,210 --> 02:42:27,400
他是羅馬的將士
He was a soldier of Rome.

1358
02:42:31,140 --> 02:42:32,650
讓我們給他榮耀
Honor him.

1359
02:42:33,010 --> 02:42:35,280
誰願意來幫我一起抬他?
Who will help me carry him?

1360
02:43:19,940 --> 02:43:21,700
現在我們都自由了
Now we are free.

1361
02:43:27,990 --> 02:43:29,960
我們會再見面的
I will see you again.

1362
02:43:32,740 --> 02:43:34,300
不過現在還不是時候
But not yet.

1363
