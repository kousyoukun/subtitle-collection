00:01:39,347 --> 00:01:40,416
Hey, Wiglow!

3
00:01:40,587 --> 00:01:41,622
Yes, sir.

4
00:01:41,787 --> 00:01:42,697
Can you hear me?

5
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:44,300
Yes, sir.

6
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:45,456
Can you find the holes?

7
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:46,616
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:46,827 --> 00:01:48,306
Make sure you get the big ones.

9
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:49,582
Yes, sir.

10
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:01,979
Ain't you got nothing to do?

11
00:02:02,147 --> 00:02:03,500
Not a thing.

12
00:02:06,147 --> 00:02:07,660
Ain't you going to help him?

13
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,260
I'm retired.

14
00:02:18,627 --> 00:02:20,106
Baby Doll.

15
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:54,217
Archie Lee, you're a mess.

16
00:03:54,707 --> 00:03:57,858
Do you know what they call
such people? Peeping Toms!

17
00:04:01,347 --> 00:04:04,145
Ain't there a name for a woman
that sleeps in a baby's crib...

18
00:04:04,307 --> 00:04:05,786
to stay away from her husband?

19
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:08,415
I'm gonna plug up the hole
in that wall...

20
00:04:08,587 --> 00:04:12,216
and if I ever catch you again
peeking at me in my sleep...

21
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:14,503
I'm moving into the
Kotton King Hotel.

22
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:18,376
And keep your filthy dogs
off my furniture!

23
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:23,258
Let me talk with you.
I want to talk with you.

24
00:04:23,427 --> 00:04:27,545
Save your breath to drum up business
for your cotton gin...

25
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,104
Close that door
so I can get dressed.

26
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:31,416
Go on, get dressed.

27
00:04:31,587 --> 00:04:34,704
Not until you get on the other
side of that door and close it.

28
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:37,984
Today is the 5th of November,
tomorrow's the 6th...

29
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:40,217
and the day after is the 7th.

30
00:04:40,387 --> 00:04:42,582
You know what day that is,
don't you?

31
00:04:43,027 --> 00:04:46,417
November 7th is your
20th birthday.

32
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:50,500
Sweet of you to remember.
Where's my birthday present?

33
00:04:51,027 --> 00:04:53,666
You'll get your birthday present...

34
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:56,182
providing you haven't forgotten
the agreement between us...

35
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:59,342
which comes due on that day.

36
00:05:01,347 --> 00:05:02,666
The agreement?

37
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:04,539
Yes, the agreement.

38
00:05:04,707 --> 00:05:06,982
You swore on the Bible
to keep your side.

39
00:05:07,147 --> 00:05:08,466
If you kept yours.

40
00:05:08,627 --> 00:05:09,946
Have I laid a hand on you?

41
00:05:10,107 --> 00:05:12,416
Yes, as often as possible...

42
00:05:12,587 --> 00:05:16,785
Have I? Have I ever once
forced myself on you?

43
00:05:16,947 --> 00:05:21,259
As your husband, by law.
Or don't the law mean nothing to you?

44
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:23,577
How about your side
of the agreement?

45
00:05:23,747 --> 00:05:27,456
You talked mighty big
when you were courting me...

46
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:31,415
you told my daddy you'd put me
in the grandest house in the county.

47
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:35,057
I put you in Tiger Tail,
I bought it and put you in it.

48
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:37,661
Tiger Tail is the grandest house
in the county.

49
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:41,615
Yes, the biggest old wreck
of a place in the whole delta.

50
00:05:41,787 --> 00:05:44,017
You said you were going
to restore this place...

51
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:47,020
exactly how it was before,
only better...

52
00:05:47,187 --> 00:05:50,543
make a show place, you said.
Yeah, a freak-show!

53
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:55,697
I've got my man on the roof now.
Can't you hear the hammer?

54
00:05:55,867 --> 00:05:59,018
Is that a hammer? I thought
it was a king size termite.

55
00:05:59,187 --> 00:06:01,621
If you ain't the most
ungrateful little...

56
00:06:02,627 --> 00:06:05,300
I have mortgaged myself
to satisfy your demands.

57
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:09,819
You told lies to my daddy
in order to get me.

58
00:06:10,107 --> 00:06:12,746
Get you?
I ain't got you yet.

59
00:06:13,627 --> 00:06:15,743
And you ain't about to either.

60
00:06:15,907 --> 00:06:19,786
I'm telling you that if
the Ideal Furniture Company...

61
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:23,223
removes those five sets
of furniture from this house...

62
00:06:23,387 --> 00:06:27,175
that agreement you spoke about
is automatically cancelled.

63
00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:30,942
Now, would you kindly
go back in your own room?

64
00:06:31,827 --> 00:06:35,456
I'm gonna get me a good job
while I'm in town today...

65
00:06:36,027 --> 00:06:40,066
just in case,
just in case.

66
00:06:50,787 --> 00:06:55,065
Admiring yourself in the mirror!
Just look at yourself.

67
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:59,426
You're not exactly a young girl's
dream come true.

68
00:06:59,947 --> 00:07:02,905
There was an old witch
named Granny Crow...

69
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:06,776
wherever she spit,
no grass would grow.

70
00:07:08,307 --> 00:07:12,300
That old witch must've spit
on the top of your head.

71
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:18,586
Thank you, thank you.

72
00:07:20,227 --> 00:07:24,857
You're a woman not grown,
therefore I'll make allowances.

73
00:07:28,227 --> 00:07:30,695
Aunt Rose screams
every time the phone rings.

74
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,540
What does she do
a fool thing like that for?

75
00:07:33,707 --> 00:07:35,379
The phone ringing scares her.

76
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:38,380
Aunt Rose, why don't you
answer the phone?

77
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:44,822
Aunt Rose.

78
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:49,422
Aunt Rose.

79
00:07:50,227 --> 00:07:54,379
Aunt Rose Comfort!

80
00:07:54,827 --> 00:07:55,896
Why don't you answer?

81
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:59,104
I can't catch my breath
when it rings.

82
00:07:59,787 --> 00:08:01,106
Answer it!

83
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:06,496
Hello?
This is Miss. Rose Comfort.

84
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:12,216
No, the lady of the house
is Mrs. Archie Lee Meighan...

85
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:15,425
They don't want to know that,
who is it and what do they want?

86
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:18,784
I can't hear well, could you
speak a bit louder?

87
00:08:20,347 --> 00:08:23,737
The Ideal Pay As You Go Plan?

88
00:08:23,907 --> 00:08:25,181
Give me the phone.

89
00:08:27,347 --> 00:08:30,976
Now, what is this, boy?
Yes.

90
00:08:31,627 --> 00:08:35,256
Today? No, you've got to
give me a little more time.

91
00:08:35,947 --> 00:08:39,019
I've had a little set back
in business lately...

92
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:42,702
The syndicate built their own
cotton gin, and I lost their trade.

93
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:46,943
It's going to take me a little
longer to recover from that...

94
00:08:48,627 --> 00:08:53,064
Then take it out!
Take it out, out, out!

95
00:08:53,227 --> 00:08:56,060
You'll never get my business again,
never.

96
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:06,779
Honey, you ain't gonna lose
your fine furniture...?

97
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:09,336
Will you shut up
and get back in the kitchen?

98
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:13,302
And don't you speak a word
of what you heard to my wife.

99
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:17,426
Don't holler anymore in this house,
and don't cackle...

100
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:23,062
or I'll pack you up and haul you off
to that home at Sunset.

101
00:09:23,707 --> 00:09:26,779
Did you say something to me
Archie Lee?

102
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:29,984
Yes. I said shoot!

103
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:40,664
What made her holler this time?

104
00:09:40,827 --> 00:09:43,546
How do I know what made her holler
this time...

105
00:09:43,707 --> 00:09:45,698
or last time,
or the next time?

106
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:49,143
The last time was because
you throwed something at her.

107
00:09:49,427 --> 00:09:51,145
What did I ever throw
at Aunt Rose?

108
00:09:51,427 --> 00:09:55,056
A glass of water, for singing
church hymns in the kitchen.

109
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:56,586
Water?

110
00:09:56,747 --> 00:09:59,739
This much water.
I barely sprinkled her.

111
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:01,022
She don't hear nothing.

112
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:02,540
I know.

113
00:10:02,827 --> 00:10:06,820
You've got to do something
to get the old woman's attention.

114
00:10:08,987 --> 00:10:10,978
Hey, hey, cut that out!
Archie!

115
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:16,542
Get your hands off me!
Get them off!

116
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:27,300
I'm moving to
the Kotton King Hotel...

117
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:32,462
the next time you try to break
our agreement, the very next time...

118
00:10:43,787 --> 00:10:45,459
Baby Doll!

119
00:10:50,587 --> 00:10:51,940
Baby Doll!

120
00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:01,616
Come down, if you're going
into town with me...

121
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,460
I've got to be at the doctor's
ten minutes ago.

122
00:11:20,227 --> 00:11:21,979
Baby Doll!

123
00:11:23,627 --> 00:11:27,222
If you're so impatient,
go ahead without me.

124
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:30,419
I've plenty of ways of
getting to town without you.

125
00:11:30,587 --> 00:11:32,066
That's true.

126
00:11:37,787 --> 00:11:40,142
You come on!

127
00:11:54,187 --> 00:11:56,781
Get your cotton-picking tail
down here.

128
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:09,943
Take your time.

129
00:12:15,867 --> 00:12:17,778
Morning, Sam.

130
00:12:23,347 --> 00:12:25,178
What are you waiting for?

131
00:12:26,227 --> 00:12:28,787
Come on, get into the car.

132
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:32,181
I'll get into the back seat
of that skatterbolt...

133
00:12:32,347 --> 00:12:35,942
when you get out, walk around,
and open the door like a gentleman.

134
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:40,337
You'll wait a long time
if that's what you're waiting for.

135
00:12:40,507 --> 00:12:44,182
I declare, my father
would turn over in his grave.

136
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,100
I never once saw your father
open a door for any woman...

137
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:51,055
especially not your
water-legged mother. Get in!

138
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,419
Sid, come here.

139
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:15,906
Why are we stopping here?

140
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:17,546
What are you doing here?

141
00:13:17,707 --> 00:13:19,902
Vacarro's got me working
for him now.

142
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,023
For him? You're working for him?

143
00:13:22,187 --> 00:13:25,065
What could I do? The syndicate
shut my gin down.

144
00:13:25,227 --> 00:13:26,376
What's going on?

145
00:13:26,547 --> 00:13:28,663
A celebration of some kind...

146
00:13:28,827 --> 00:13:30,943
Why shouldn't they celebrate?

147
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:33,860
It's got every last bit of business
in the county.

148
00:13:34,427 --> 00:13:37,339
Every last bit of what
you and I used to get.

149
00:13:37,907 --> 00:13:41,456
They've got an up-to-date gin,
not like your pile of junk.

150
00:13:42,827 --> 00:13:44,977
When are we getting out of here?

151
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:13,025
Would you mind
moving your arm?

152
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:17,498
Happy anniversary.

153
00:14:28,107 --> 00:14:29,779
She's sure grown up.

154
00:14:30,147 --> 00:14:34,299
I'm as fond of Aunt Rose as you are,
but I'm in no position to feed and...

155
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:37,857
Look here, the day Aunt Rose
is unwelcome under your roof...

156
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:39,506
her and me both
is moving out.

157
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:40,816
She can't cook...

158
00:14:40,987 --> 00:14:44,138
If you don't like her cooking,
get me a regular servant...

159
00:14:44,307 --> 00:14:47,504
don't think I'll cook for
a big fat old thing like you.

160
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:48,463
Quit saying fat...

161
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:51,016
Lose weight
and I'll quit saying it.

162
00:14:51,187 --> 00:14:55,738
Right, but I'm serving you notice,
if that old woman dies in my house...

163
00:14:55,907 --> 00:15:00,264
I ain't gonna pay for her funeral.
I'll have her burned up. Cremated.

164
00:15:00,427 --> 00:15:02,782
I'll pack her ashes
in an old bottle...

165
00:15:02,947 --> 00:15:05,177
and I'll pitch the bottle
into Tiger Tail Bayou.

166
00:15:05,347 --> 00:15:07,781
Mr. Meighan,
you're late for your appointment.

167
00:15:07,987 --> 00:15:10,785
The doctor will see you anyway,
I don't know why.

168
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:23,295
Hey.

169
00:15:24,747 --> 00:15:25,862
Hi.

170
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:27,382
Are you the dentist?

171
00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:29,538
Yes, ma'am, I'm the dentist.

172
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:34,856
I was scouting around for a job
and I noticed your sign...

173
00:15:35,027 --> 00:15:36,858
and I thought I might
help you out.

174
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,824
What are you doing?

175
00:15:42,987 --> 00:15:46,662
A boy in here a while ago
beat me playing checkers.

176
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:48,977
I still can't figure out why.

177
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:53,026
Well, what do you do?
Can you type?

178
00:15:56,427 --> 00:15:59,737
No, I don't do no typing...

179
00:16:00,787 --> 00:16:02,903
but I print a real good hand.

180
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:06,745
I don't know whether
we can use that.

181
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:12,065
You're awful young
to be a dentist.

182
00:16:13,187 --> 00:16:16,179
I'm just getting started.

183
00:16:17,787 --> 00:16:20,540
What's the matter with you?

184
00:16:23,267 --> 00:16:25,223
I haven't been myself, John.

185
00:16:25,387 --> 00:16:26,820
In what way?

186
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:36,897
Well, you're not an old man,
but you're not a young man either.

187
00:16:37,307 --> 00:16:39,377
That's the truth, it's no lie.

188
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:40,662
How long have you been married?

189
00:16:40,827 --> 00:16:42,465
About a year.

190
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:47,465
She's pretty.

191
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:49,545
Yeah, I guess so.

192
00:16:50,507 --> 00:16:52,020
Youth.

193
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:57,097
Been under some sort of a strain?

194
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,098
No, no strain at all.

195
00:16:59,907 --> 00:17:01,738
You look mighty nervous to me.

196
00:17:01,947 --> 00:17:03,585
I'm not nervous.

197
00:17:13,107 --> 00:17:17,897
You'd have to know typing.
It's typing.

198
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:20,741
Awfully nice talking to you.

199
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,135
Yes, ma'am.

200
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:28,540
Mr. Meighan, come back in here.

201
00:17:28,707 --> 00:17:31,096
The doctor's going to give you
a prescription.

202
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:37,026
Archie Lee, all I think you need
is a harmless sedative.

203
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:41,699
Take this down to old man Hogg,
and take it according to directions.

204
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:44,540
Here you are.
Don't forget your sweater.

205
00:17:44,987 --> 00:17:47,376
It won't help what's wrong
with you one bit.

206
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:54,146
How you doing, Archie?

207
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:58,585
I've spent just about the whole day
sitting on Main Street.

208
00:18:03,387 --> 00:18:06,060
Why didn't you bring me
a double dip?

209
00:18:06,707 --> 00:18:08,186
How long are we gonna sit here?

210
00:18:08,347 --> 00:18:10,463
I've got to wait
for my prescription.

211
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,578
What the hell's so funny?

212
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:22,741
Chinamen. People know
the situation between us.

213
00:18:23,627 --> 00:18:26,505
Yesterday on Front St,
a man said to me...

214
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:29,340
"Has your wife
outgrowed her crib yet?"

215
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:34,736
Three or four others haw-hawed at me.
It was public humiliation.

216
00:18:35,787 --> 00:18:38,938
Private humiliation
is just as painful.

217
00:18:40,747 --> 00:18:42,863
There's no torture to equal
the torture...

218
00:18:43,027 --> 00:18:45,461
which a cold woman
inflicts on a man.

219
00:18:46,147 --> 00:18:48,263
There's no torture
to compare with it.

220
00:18:48,907 --> 00:18:51,979
I've staked out a lot in hell,
with a rotten house on it...

221
00:18:52,147 --> 00:18:55,025
and five sets of furniture
not paid for.

222
00:18:55,187 --> 00:18:57,747
You've bit off more
than you can chew.

223
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:06,257
Archie Lee, is that our furniture?

224
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:08,740
No, no it isn't.

225
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:14,906
They're taking away our furniture,
go after them.

226
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:16,898
I've got to wait
for my prescription.

227
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:19,900
Prescription?
Mister, stop.

228
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:21,580
Come here. Come here.

229
00:19:21,747 --> 00:19:23,021
Stop, please.

230
00:19:23,187 --> 00:19:26,065
Let's get home before
they get the rest of it.

231
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:28,905
Baby Doll!

232
00:19:32,307 --> 00:19:32,898
You better go get her?

233
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,659
I guess I better.

234
00:19:37,027 --> 00:19:38,176
What would you do?

235
00:19:38,347 --> 00:19:39,985
Get tough with her.

236
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:41,865
Easy to say.
Come on.

237
00:19:50,227 --> 00:19:52,218
Look out, here comes trouble.

238
00:19:54,747 --> 00:19:57,898
- What about those people, boss?
- Just keep loading.

239
00:19:58,547 --> 00:20:00,424
Get out of my chair,
out of my chair!

240
00:20:00,587 --> 00:20:03,306
Stay off my furniture!

241
00:20:03,507 --> 00:20:06,863
That's my rose lamp,
get off!

242
00:20:07,787 --> 00:20:09,857
She better not hit me again.

243
00:20:10,347 --> 00:20:12,224
Put that down!

244
00:20:22,947 --> 00:20:25,381
I thought I heard
something rattling.

245
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:36,946
Leave me alone.

246
00:20:37,107 --> 00:20:40,702
I don't want to be with a man who'd
make me live without furniture.

247
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:41,777
Honey...

248
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:44,939
My daddy would turn over
in his grave if he knew.

249
00:20:45,107 --> 00:20:49,180
Baby Doll, if your father turned
in his grave as often as you say...

250
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:52,020
the old man would
fall off the graveyard.

251
00:20:53,387 --> 00:20:58,063
Look at Aunt Rose, picking roses
as if nothing had happened.

252
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:01,496
I'm moving to
the Kotton King Hotel.

253
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,502
I'm moving to
the Kotton King Hotel.

254
00:21:05,227 --> 00:21:06,819
I'm gonna get me a good job.

255
00:21:06,987 --> 00:21:10,662
The hotel manager helped carry
my daddy's coffin, he'll give me one.

256
00:21:10,907 --> 00:21:13,546
What sort of work
do you think you could do?

257
00:21:14,427 --> 00:21:17,021
I could curl hair
at a beauty parlour.

258
00:21:17,187 --> 00:21:19,542
Or I reckon I could be
a hostess...

259
00:21:19,707 --> 00:21:21,220
Second floor's all clear now.

260
00:21:21,387 --> 00:21:22,945
Smile at people coming in a place.

261
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:23,698
What place?

262
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:27,064
Any place.
I could be a cashier.

263
00:21:27,227 --> 00:21:29,138
You can't count.

264
00:21:29,307 --> 00:21:34,256
Well, I could pass out menus
or programmes or something.

265
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:36,460
Say hello to people.

266
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:39,217
I can say hello.

267
00:21:40,227 --> 00:21:41,740
Sign here.

268
00:21:45,987 --> 00:21:48,262
Kotton King?
This is Mrs. Meighan...

269
00:21:48,427 --> 00:21:51,146
I want to reserve a room
for tomorrow morning.

270
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:54,103
I want to register
under my maiden name...

271
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:56,940
which is Baby Doll
Carson McCorkle.

272
00:21:57,227 --> 00:21:59,457
My daddy was
T.C. Carson McCorkle...

273
00:21:59,627 --> 00:22:02,187
he died last summer,
when I got married...

274
00:22:02,347 --> 00:22:06,022
he was a very close personal friend
of the manager of the hotel.

275
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:10,740
What's his name?

276
00:22:16,187 --> 00:22:19,065
Archie Lee,
look at these flowers.

277
00:22:19,827 --> 00:22:22,102
Poems of nature.

278
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:39,303
When are we going to gin out
some more cotton, Mr. Archie?

279
00:22:56,787 --> 00:22:58,220
Oh, my.

280
00:23:20,947 --> 00:23:23,859
That's the strongest brandy
I ever had.

281
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,700
It must've come right out
of Tiger Tail brook.

282
00:23:27,587 --> 00:23:30,420
Young man, Mr. Vacarro...

283
00:23:30,587 --> 00:23:32,782
this is a mighty fine party
you're throwing tonight...

284
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:37,225
in honour of your first anniversary
as manager of the syndicate gin.

285
00:23:38,387 --> 00:23:40,503
Just a minute there, sonny,
hold it.

286
00:23:41,747 --> 00:23:45,103
I've got something I ought
to get off my chest.

287
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:48,259
Us good neighbours appreciate...

288
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,416
Just a second.

289
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:54,060
Gentlemen, there'll be
a fish fry Saturday night.

290
00:23:54,627 --> 00:23:57,095
Catfish, hush puppies,
dancing...

291
00:23:57,787 --> 00:23:59,266
bring your ladies.

292
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,665
You go right on.

293
00:24:02,827 --> 00:24:06,342
I want you to know us neighbours
appreciate your achievement...

294
00:24:06,587 --> 00:24:09,306
in bringing in the biggest
cotton crop ever picked...

295
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:12,265
on this blessed soil
of Tiger Tail County.

296
00:24:12,427 --> 00:24:14,895
Senator, my old dad once said...

297
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:18,616
"Blessed is he who has nothing to say
and cannot be persuaded to say it".

298
00:24:19,107 --> 00:24:20,859
A couple of boys
don't look too happy.

299
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:23,257
They've no reason to be.
You put them out of business.

300
00:24:24,507 --> 00:24:28,216
- They've got plenty of good liquor.
- I'll drink my own.

301
00:24:33,187 --> 00:24:35,417
When you first came here...

302
00:24:35,787 --> 00:24:38,824
I'll admit us old-timers
we a bit standoffish.

303
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,821
We didn't know you all that well.

304
00:24:42,267 --> 00:24:46,704
Naturally, what's profitable to some
is unprofitable to others.

305
00:24:47,267 --> 00:24:50,816
As the fella says, one man's meat
is another man's poison.

306
00:24:51,987 --> 00:24:55,263
We all know some folks here
have suffered financially...

307
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:59,466
due in some way to this man's success
with his syndicate plantation...

308
00:24:59,907 --> 00:25:03,502
but as a whole, the community
stands to reap a nice fat profit.

309
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:06,864
Senator, next time,
run on a Republican ticket...

310
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:09,063
we'll get the nigger vote
out for you.

311
00:25:12,827 --> 00:25:16,900
Silva! Silva!

312
00:25:23,547 --> 00:25:25,742
Mr Silva!

313
00:25:37,347 --> 00:25:39,622
Move the wagons!
Move them!

314
00:25:39,787 --> 00:25:41,743
Get that cotton moving!

315
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:50,545
Get the cotton moving!
Get those wagons out!

316
00:25:50,707 --> 00:25:53,619
Mr Silva, where are you?

317
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:22,459
They're trying to kill me.

318
00:26:22,787 --> 00:26:24,459
I found this...

319
00:26:28,707 --> 00:26:30,379
kerosene can.

320
00:26:52,307 --> 00:26:55,697
Marshal, what are you going to do
to find the men that burned my gin?

321
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,700
What makes you sure your gin
was set fire to?

322
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:03,383
Look around you. You ever seen
so many happy faces?

323
00:27:04,347 --> 00:27:07,862
It's like a rich man's funeral
with all his relations attending.

324
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:09,745
I'd hate to have to prove that.

325
00:27:09,907 --> 00:27:12,182
I'd hate to have to depend on you
to prove it.

326
00:27:14,827 --> 00:27:17,899
I can't honestly imagine, if it's
a case of arson, who done it.

327
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:21,821
Every man you put out of business was
in that gin when the fire broke out.

328
00:27:21,987 --> 00:27:24,057
One wasn't,
I know of one that wasn't.

329
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:26,980
Naming names just on suspicion
is a risky business.

330
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:31,220
I didn't name a name. But whoever
did it forgot to take this with him.

331
00:27:31,387 --> 00:27:33,298
Marshal, he's your deputy.

332
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:36,300
I'll take this can
and examine it very carefully.

333
00:27:36,467 --> 00:27:39,937
See if there's a basis for thinking
it was used for starting a fire.

334
00:27:40,347 --> 00:27:43,544
I ran through fire to get this,
I mean to keep it.

335
00:27:43,707 --> 00:27:46,540
Lock it in the pick-up truck.

336
00:27:58,227 --> 00:28:00,866
Ginnie, sing us a song.

337
00:28:02,867 --> 00:28:07,622
I shall not,
I shall not be moved.

338
00:28:08,627 --> 00:28:13,621
I shall not,
I shall not be moved...

339
00:28:13,907 --> 00:28:18,901
like a tree that's planted
by the water...

340
00:28:20,227 --> 00:28:23,936
I shall not be moved.

341
00:28:24,307 --> 00:28:27,105
How are you going to gin out
the rest of your cotton?

342
00:28:27,947 --> 00:28:30,222
I'll truck it over to Sunset.

343
00:28:30,987 --> 00:28:33,262
Collins will gin it out for me.

344
00:28:34,227 --> 00:28:35,945
Collins has got his own cotton
to gin.

345
00:28:36,107 --> 00:28:38,462
Well, I'll truck it over
to Bolivar county.

346
00:28:38,627 --> 00:28:41,016
No one around here's
gonna gin it out for me.

347
00:28:41,427 --> 00:28:45,102
I shall not be moved.

348
00:28:47,787 --> 00:28:49,220
Silva!

349
00:28:55,987 --> 00:28:57,102
Get off...

350
00:28:57,267 --> 00:28:58,939
It's me.

351
00:28:59,427 --> 00:29:00,576
They got the can, boss.

352
00:29:00,747 --> 00:29:01,338
Who?

353
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:04,579
Somebody jumped me
from the rear.

354
00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:09,857
Stay back, stay back.

355
00:29:13,227 --> 00:29:15,946
Boy, take the advice
of an old-timer...

356
00:29:16,267 --> 00:29:18,906
who was born and raised
in this county...

357
00:29:19,067 --> 00:29:22,696
and knows every nigger,
every hound dog...

358
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:25,620
every toadstool and every tree stump
in 50 miles around.

359
00:29:25,907 --> 00:29:29,058
My advice is not to make
any more reckless charges.

360
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:32,025
Being a foreigner, you already
got strike one and two...

361
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,623
I want no advice, no law
and no court in this county.

362
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:39,696
I'm from an old country where
it's tradition for each man...

363
00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:41,823
to make his own justice...

364
00:29:41,987 --> 00:29:45,536
like bootleg liquor,
private, in secret.

365
00:29:45,987 --> 00:29:48,455
Because there was corruption
there too...

366
00:29:48,627 --> 00:29:52,905
and justice was executed by
each man himself, alone.

367
00:29:53,307 --> 00:29:56,504
I mean Biblical justice.

368
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:59,306
Eye for eye,
tooth for tooth.

369
00:30:00,107 --> 00:30:01,586
Let's go.

370
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,143
I've got to know who did this.

371
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,539
I think I know.

372
00:30:32,427 --> 00:30:34,577
Which one did it?
You know.

373
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:37,820
They were all in the shed
except one...

374
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:40,456
the one who wasn't,
I figure did it.

375
00:30:44,027 --> 00:30:46,939
He's the one who's
going to gin out my cotton.

376
00:31:14,547 --> 00:31:15,662
Get her up.

377
00:31:23,387 --> 00:31:25,503
Furniture's coming back today.

378
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:26,782
Have mercy...

379
00:31:26,947 --> 00:31:28,619
Go on, get.

380
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:40,065
Don't say a word, a little bird
already told me...

381
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:42,787
you'd bring wagons full of cotton
straight to my door.

382
00:31:42,947 --> 00:31:45,461
I want you to know
you're a very lucky fella.

383
00:31:45,627 --> 00:31:46,139
How come?

384
00:31:46,307 --> 00:31:50,220
I'm in a position to hold back the
other orders and give you priority.

385
00:31:50,987 --> 00:31:53,501
Come on, get out of that truck
and have some coffee.

386
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:54,577
What's the price?

387
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,658
You remember, it hasn't changed.

388
00:31:56,827 --> 00:31:58,021
How about your equipment?

389
00:31:58,187 --> 00:32:00,826
A1 shape, always was.
You ought to remember that.

390
00:32:00,987 --> 00:32:03,296
You needed a new saw cylinder.
You got one?

391
00:32:03,467 --> 00:32:06,584
I can't find one on the market
to equal the old one yet.

392
00:32:06,747 --> 00:32:10,057
Come on, have some coffee.
We're ready for you.

393
00:32:11,427 --> 00:32:14,817
When you saw my gin burn down
last night you must've figured...

394
00:32:14,987 --> 00:32:18,297
you might get a good deal of business
your way in the morning.

395
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:20,219
You want to know something?

396
00:32:21,027 --> 00:32:23,541
I'm always glad to know something
when there's something to know.

397
00:32:24,347 --> 00:32:27,737
I never did see that fire of yours.
No, sir.

398
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:31,817
No, sir. Come on. Come on
in my house and have some coffee.

399
00:32:31,987 --> 00:32:35,536
You, you come too.
Come on, come on.

400
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:38,580
No, I never did see that fire.

401
00:32:38,747 --> 00:32:43,298
We hit the sack after supper and I
didn't know till this morning.

402
00:32:43,627 --> 00:32:46,346
Baby Doll, come out here.
Come here, Baby Doll.

403
00:32:46,707 --> 00:32:49,938
I want you to meet Mr. Vacarro,
from the syndicate plantation.

404
00:32:50,307 --> 00:32:51,786
Say, what's your first name?

405
00:32:52,507 --> 00:32:53,656
How do you spell it?

406
00:32:53,827 --> 00:32:55,863
S, I, L, V, A.

407
00:32:56,027 --> 00:32:58,222
Sure enough?
Like a "silva" lining?

408
00:32:58,427 --> 00:33:01,305
Every cloud has got
a silver lining!

409
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:03,458
What's that from, the Bible?

410
00:33:04,027 --> 00:33:05,619
No, the mother goose book.

411
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:10,103
That name sounds foreign.

412
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:12,186
It is, Mrs. Meighan...

413
00:33:12,467 --> 00:33:15,504
I'm known as the wop that runs
the syndicate plantation.

414
00:33:15,707 --> 00:33:18,858
Don't call yourself names,
let the others do that.

415
00:33:19,227 --> 00:33:22,583
You sure are a lucky fella, Silva,
gold or nickel plated...

416
00:33:22,747 --> 00:33:26,342
you're lucky I could take
a job on of your size now.

417
00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:29,817
You're my neighbour and I believe
in the good neighbour policy.

418
00:33:29,987 --> 00:33:33,024
You do me a good turn,
and I'll do you a good turn.

419
00:33:33,187 --> 00:33:37,499
Tit for tat and tat for tit
is the policy we live on.

420
00:33:37,787 --> 00:33:39,743
Aunt Rose Comfort...

421
00:33:39,987 --> 00:33:41,739
Baby Doll...

422
00:33:42,507 --> 00:33:45,783
Get your daddy's old maid sister
to bring coffee for Mr. Vacarro.

423
00:33:45,947 --> 00:33:47,426
Get her yourself?

424
00:33:47,587 --> 00:33:48,781
Honey...

425
00:33:49,067 --> 00:33:51,786
Honey, honey, honey.

426
00:33:52,547 --> 00:33:55,186
I want you to entertain
these gentlemen.

427
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:58,466
Look, look at her blush.
Look.

428
00:33:59,307 --> 00:34:02,026
Look at her blush.
This is my Baby...

429
00:34:02,187 --> 00:34:05,224
My little girl, every precious
ounce of her is mine.

430
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,861
Aunt Rose!

431
00:34:09,227 --> 00:34:10,899
Aunt Rose Comfort!

432
00:34:17,227 --> 00:34:20,936
Excuse my yawn, we was up
awful late last night.

433
00:34:26,467 --> 00:34:28,059
So, you're a wop?

434
00:34:28,907 --> 00:34:32,104
I'm a Sicilian, Mrs. Meighan,
a very ancient people.

435
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:36,937
Sicilian...

436
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:39,264
I'm from Corpus Christi.

437
00:34:40,027 --> 00:34:41,540
How unusual.

438
00:34:41,987 --> 00:34:45,218
Honey, at noon, I want you
to take Mr. Vacarro...

439
00:34:45,387 --> 00:34:48,777
to the Kotton King for a chicken
dinner. Sign my name...

440
00:34:50,147 --> 00:34:52,138
When bad luck hits you...

441
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:54,457
you find out who your friends are.
I mean to prove it.

442
00:34:54,947 --> 00:34:58,383
Baby Doll, I want you to entertain
this gentleman in the house...

443
00:34:58,547 --> 00:35:01,380
it's the good neighbour policy,
tit for tat and tat for tit.

444
00:35:01,547 --> 00:35:04,744
You do me a good turn
and I'll do you a good turn.

445
00:35:04,907 --> 00:35:07,785
That's right, come on, honey.

446
00:35:07,947 --> 00:35:10,381
Now, make those wagons move now,
get them rolling.

447
00:35:11,867 --> 00:35:14,301
I can't make nobody comfortable
in that house...

448
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:16,901
you're lucky if you can find
a chair to sit down on.

449
00:35:19,427 --> 00:35:20,746
You want coffee?

450
00:35:21,387 --> 00:35:24,185
No, just a cool drink of water,
thank you, ma'am.

451
00:35:24,827 --> 00:35:27,899
The house water runs warm...

452
00:35:28,067 --> 00:35:30,661
but if you've the energy to work
that old pump...

453
00:35:30,827 --> 00:35:34,502
you can get a nice cool drink
from that cistern.

454
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:38,027
I've got energy to burn.

455
00:35:53,707 --> 00:35:58,462
They dump their garbage in the yard.
Ignorance, indulgence and stink.

456
00:35:58,627 --> 00:36:00,857
Well Mrs. Meighan
smelled pretty good.

457
00:36:01,027 --> 00:36:03,461
You keep your nose
in the cotton.

458
00:36:03,627 --> 00:36:06,505
Sometimes, water comes,
sometimes it don't.

459
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:08,658
This time it will.

460
00:36:12,507 --> 00:36:15,863
Bring me a drink of that nice
cool well water, please.

461
00:36:17,587 --> 00:36:20,101
"So, you're a wop?"

462
00:36:23,507 --> 00:36:28,376
I don't have the strength anymore
to draw water out of that well.

463
00:36:28,907 --> 00:36:30,545
Would you like a cool drink
of water?

464
00:36:30,707 --> 00:36:33,699
How do you do?
I'm Aunt Rose Comfort.

465
00:36:34,027 --> 00:36:38,179
My brother was Baby Doll's daddy,
Mr. T.C. Carson McCorkle.

466
00:36:39,187 --> 00:36:41,940
I've been visiting here since...

467
00:36:43,107 --> 00:36:46,656
I can't remember
just when it was.

468
00:36:46,827 --> 00:36:50,979
I hope you don't mind
drinking out of a gourd.

469
00:36:56,027 --> 00:37:00,976
Excuse me please, that old hen
has got back in my kitchen.

470
00:37:03,267 --> 00:37:05,303
I could think of worse ways
to spend an afternoon...

471
00:37:05,467 --> 00:37:08,504
than drinking cool well water
with Mrs. Meighan.

472
00:37:15,627 --> 00:37:18,937
Stay with the cotton.
Go on, stay with the cotton.

473
00:37:25,467 --> 00:37:27,617
There's such a difference
in water...

474
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,859
you wouldn't think so,
but there certainly is.

475
00:37:32,307 --> 00:37:35,663
I take it you've not had
this place long, Mrs. Meighan?

476
00:37:35,827 --> 00:37:38,182
No. We've had it long.

477
00:37:40,107 --> 00:37:44,020
Don't you have garbage collectors
on Tiger Tail road?

478
00:37:44,907 --> 00:37:48,502
Oh, it costs extra for them
to come out here...

479
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,305
and Archie Lee...

480
00:37:50,827 --> 00:37:53,819
I don't know,
I almost give up sometimes.

481
00:37:56,907 --> 00:38:01,378
You say you've got a bunch of
unfurnished rooms in this house?

482
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:03,659
Five complete sets of furniture...

483
00:38:03,827 --> 00:38:07,786
hauled away by the Ideal Pay
As You Go Plan Furniture Company.

484
00:38:09,027 --> 00:38:12,542
When did this misfortune
fall upon you?

485
00:38:13,187 --> 00:38:16,941
Yesterday. Ain't that awful?
Yesterday.

486
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:20,459
Both of us had misfortunes
on the same day...

487
00:38:21,187 --> 00:38:23,826
You lost your furniture,
my cotton gin burned down.

488
00:38:23,987 --> 00:38:25,261
Yes...

489
00:38:25,787 --> 00:38:26,776
Quite a coincidence!

490
00:38:26,947 --> 00:38:28,175
What's that?

491
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:31,101
I said it was a coincidence
of misfortune.

492
00:38:31,987 --> 00:38:36,424
Sure. What can you do with
a bunch of unfurnished rooms?

493
00:38:39,787 --> 00:38:43,143
Well, you could play
hide and seek.

494
00:38:43,747 --> 00:38:45,817
Not me, I'm not athletic.

495
00:38:47,027 --> 00:38:51,942
When I arrived in this county to
take over the syndicate plantation...

496
00:38:53,027 --> 00:38:55,780
this house was empty, I was told
it was haunted.

497
00:38:56,027 --> 00:38:59,702
Yes, that's why Archie Lee
got it for almost nothing.

498
00:39:00,707 --> 00:39:03,426
Sometimes I don't know where
to go or what to do.

499
00:39:03,707 --> 00:39:07,700
That's not uncommon, people enter
this world without instructions.

500
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,706
I said...

501
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:11,865
Is that your breakfast?

502
00:39:15,107 --> 00:39:17,780
I said, people come into this world
without instructions...

503
00:39:17,947 --> 00:39:20,017
where to go or what to do.

504
00:39:20,187 --> 00:39:23,065
They wander a little
and then go away.

505
00:39:23,747 --> 00:39:26,215
Drift for a while
and then vanish...

506
00:39:27,027 --> 00:39:29,257
they make room
for newcomers.

507
00:39:30,627 --> 00:39:33,664
Old goes, new comes.

508
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:38,137
Going and coming, back and forth.
Rush, rush.

509
00:39:39,547 --> 00:39:42,664
Permanent, nothing.

510
00:39:44,827 --> 00:39:46,260
Anything living...

511
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:50,225
that lasts long enough
to take it serious...

512
00:39:52,027 --> 00:39:53,016
What's this?

513
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:56,179
It's that old car
belonging to Mrs. Dobarn...

514
00:39:56,347 --> 00:39:59,100
the lady that used to own this house
and haunts it now.

515
00:40:00,027 --> 00:40:01,779
Where to, madam?

516
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:03,705
We're gonna play chauffeur.

517
00:40:10,787 --> 00:40:14,462
Drive me along the river with all
the windows open to cool me off.

518
00:40:15,347 --> 00:40:16,746
The chauffeur sits in the front.

519
00:40:16,907 --> 00:40:19,023
That seat's got no cushion.

520
00:40:20,147 --> 00:40:23,025
Come on! Get on your feet,
let's go!

521
00:40:27,027 --> 00:40:30,861
Look out, get on your feet,
let's get in there.

522
00:40:31,827 --> 00:40:33,624
Let's cut some cotton.

523
00:40:37,107 --> 00:40:39,746
It's hard to find a place to sit
since the Ideal Furniture Company...

524
00:40:39,907 --> 00:40:42,057
lost patience,
to sit in comfort.

525
00:40:42,227 --> 00:40:46,823
It's hard to sit in comfort when the
Ideal people lost their patience...

526
00:40:47,907 --> 00:40:50,467
and your gin burns down.

527
00:40:57,987 --> 00:40:58,976
Would you move your leg?

528
00:40:59,147 --> 00:41:01,024
But it's cool in here.

529
00:41:01,307 --> 00:41:05,141
Comfortable to sit in.
What's this here?

530
00:41:05,707 --> 00:41:09,336
It's my charm bracelet.
My daddy gave it to me.

531
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:12,544
They're the Ten Commandments.

532
00:41:12,987 --> 00:41:14,136
And these here?

533
00:41:14,307 --> 00:41:15,626
My birthday.

534
00:41:17,147 --> 00:41:19,342
How many charming birthdays
have you had?

535
00:41:20,587 --> 00:41:23,147
As many as the charms
on the bracelet.

536
00:41:24,147 --> 00:41:24,738
Do you mind?

537
00:41:24,907 --> 00:41:26,101
Count them.

538
00:41:38,467 --> 00:41:39,661
That's all.

539
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:42,265
I'll be 20 tomorrow.

540
00:41:42,747 --> 00:41:46,217
Tomorrow is election day
and my birthday...

541
00:41:46,987 --> 00:41:50,741
and the day that Franklin Roosevelt
was elected for the first time.

542
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:54,659
It's a great day for the country
for both reasons.

543
00:41:55,907 --> 00:41:58,580
He was a man to respect.

544
00:41:59,067 --> 00:42:01,297
And you're a lady to respect.

545
00:42:02,427 --> 00:42:03,860
Me?

546
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:07,342
I never got past the fourth grade.

547
00:42:07,947 --> 00:42:09,380
Why did you quit?

548
00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:13,456
Well, I had a great deal of trouble
with long division.

549
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:19,945
The teacher would send me up to the
blackboard to work on a problem...

550
00:42:21,107 --> 00:42:24,816
and I would go up to the blackboard,
lean my head against it...

551
00:42:26,027 --> 00:42:28,746
and cry and cry.

552
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:33,423
Would you move your leg?

553
00:42:35,467 --> 00:42:37,662
You want me to move my leg?

554
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,736
Otherwise, I can't get out.

555
00:42:41,907 --> 00:42:43,056
OK.

556
00:42:44,747 --> 00:42:45,941
Well...

557
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:49,860
I'd just cry and cry and cry.

558
00:42:51,187 --> 00:42:54,099
Well, finally I left school...

559
00:42:54,267 --> 00:42:57,896
and a girl without education,
a girl without...

560
00:43:00,107 --> 00:43:01,460
Mr. Vacarro?

561
00:43:03,067 --> 00:43:05,342
Just picking up a few
pecan nuts.

562
00:43:07,267 --> 00:43:09,417
Excuse me...

563
00:43:09,867 --> 00:43:11,619
Excuse me, Mr. Vacarro...

564
00:43:11,787 --> 00:43:15,257
but I wouldn't dream of eating a nut
a man had cracked in his mouth.

565
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:18,177
You've got many refinements.

566
00:43:19,387 --> 00:43:20,615
Thank you.

567
00:43:21,947 --> 00:43:26,782
I don't think you need worry about
your failure at long division.

568
00:43:27,547 --> 00:43:30,107
After all, you got through
short division...

569
00:43:30,267 --> 00:43:34,021
short division is all a lady ought
to be called on to cope with.

570
00:43:35,907 --> 00:43:37,135
Well...

571
00:43:37,787 --> 00:43:39,505
I ought to be going in now.

572
00:43:47,147 --> 00:43:50,423
I get so depressed going through
all them empty rooms.

573
00:43:50,827 --> 00:43:52,419
Are all the rooms empty?

574
00:43:52,747 --> 00:43:56,626
Except the nursery and kitchen.
The stuff there is paid for.

575
00:43:57,027 --> 00:43:58,745
Do you have a child
in the nursery?

576
00:43:59,467 --> 00:44:01,423
Me? No.

577
00:44:02,467 --> 00:44:04,298
I sleep in the nursery myself.

578
00:44:05,027 --> 00:44:07,587
I let the slats down
on the crib.

579
00:44:07,747 --> 00:44:10,056
Why do you sleep
in the nursery?

580
00:44:11,627 --> 00:44:15,256
Mr. Vacarro, that's
a personal question.

581
00:44:20,707 --> 00:44:24,097
Well, I ought to be
going in now.

582
00:44:34,907 --> 00:44:38,343
There are rooms in that house
I've never been in...

583
00:44:39,147 --> 00:44:41,502
like, for instance, the attic.

584
00:44:42,187 --> 00:44:46,339
Most of the time I'm scared
to go in that house by myself.

585
00:44:46,547 --> 00:44:48,856
Just take last night,
when the fire broke out...

586
00:44:49,027 --> 00:44:52,702
I sat here for hours waiting
for Archie Lee to come home...

587
00:44:53,027 --> 00:44:55,461
I was scared of going in
the house by myself.

588
00:44:55,627 --> 00:44:59,700
It must have been scary, without
your husband to look out for you.

589
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:04,702
I'm telling you. The fire broke out
and lit up the whole sky...

590
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:07,142
with crazy shadows.

591
00:45:07,387 --> 00:45:09,662
And we didn't have a Coke
in the house.

592
00:45:09,827 --> 00:45:11,545
I was mad at Archie Lee.

593
00:45:11,707 --> 00:45:13,777
You were mad, why?

594
00:45:13,947 --> 00:45:16,700
He went off and left me
without a Coke in the house.

595
00:45:16,867 --> 00:45:18,539
He left you without a Coke?

596
00:45:18,707 --> 00:45:20,299
Yes, he did.

597
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:24,779
And he didn't get back until
way after the fire had broken out.

598
00:45:25,107 --> 00:45:30,056
I got smoke in my eyes,
in my nose, in my throat...

599
00:45:32,067 --> 00:45:35,821
I was in such a worn out
nervous condition, I cried.

600
00:45:36,147 --> 00:45:40,459
Finally, I took two teaspoons
of paregoric.

601
00:45:40,627 --> 00:45:43,346
Sounds like you passed
a very uncomfortable night.

602
00:45:44,827 --> 00:45:46,465
Sounds like?

603
00:45:47,027 --> 00:45:48,779
It was.

604
00:45:50,507 --> 00:45:53,260
So Mr. Meighan disappeared
after supper.

605
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:58,984
You say Mr. Meighan left the house
for a while after supper?

606
00:46:00,627 --> 00:46:02,618
Yes, for a moment.

607
00:46:03,067 --> 00:46:04,420
Just a moment?

608
00:46:05,787 --> 00:46:07,982
How long a moment?

609
00:46:08,147 --> 00:46:09,500
What are you driving at?

610
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:11,180
Driving at?

611
00:46:11,427 --> 00:46:13,782
You're looking at me so funny.

612
00:46:14,027 --> 00:46:17,656
How long a moment did he
disappear for, can you remember?

613
00:46:17,827 --> 00:46:20,705
What difference does it make?
It doesn't matter...

614
00:46:20,867 --> 00:46:22,585
Why should you mind my asking?

615
00:46:23,427 --> 00:46:25,179
You make it sound like
I'm on trial.

616
00:46:25,587 --> 00:46:27,737
Don't you like to pretend
like you're a witness?

617
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:31,306
Witness of what?

618
00:46:31,467 --> 00:46:34,345
Say, for instance,
a case of arson.

619
00:46:36,747 --> 00:46:37,736
Arson?

620
00:46:38,187 --> 00:46:40,781
The wilful destruction
of property by fire.

621
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:43,180
What?

622
00:46:43,427 --> 00:46:47,102
About my husband leaving after
supper, I can explain that.

623
00:46:47,267 --> 00:46:48,063
Can you?

624
00:46:48,227 --> 00:46:48,784
Sure.

625
00:46:48,947 --> 00:46:51,302
Good, how can you explain it?

626
00:46:53,547 --> 00:46:57,335
What's the matter?
Can't you collect your thoughts?

627
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:03,377
Your mind's a blank
on the subject?

628
00:47:04,747 --> 00:47:09,298
Do you find it impossible to remember
just why your husband disappeared?

629
00:47:10,867 --> 00:47:14,780
You can't imagine what kind
of errand he went on, can you?

630
00:47:15,227 --> 00:47:18,776
But, when he returned...

631
00:47:18,947 --> 00:47:22,337
the fire had just broken out
at the syndicate plantation.

632
00:47:24,507 --> 00:47:27,226
I can't imagine what you could
possible be driving at.

633
00:47:27,387 --> 00:47:32,222
No? You're a very unsatisfactory
witness, Mrs. Meighan.

634
00:47:35,627 --> 00:47:37,345
Should we drop the subject?

635
00:47:38,547 --> 00:47:39,741
I sure wish you would.

636
00:47:39,907 --> 00:47:41,181
Well, sure.

637
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:47,057
It's no use crying over
a burnt down gin.

638
00:47:49,787 --> 00:47:51,857
Besides,
like your husband said...

639
00:47:53,027 --> 00:47:56,702
this world is built on the principle
of tit for tat.

640
00:47:58,787 --> 00:48:00,106
What do you mean?

641
00:48:04,187 --> 00:48:05,666
Nothing specific.

642
00:48:09,547 --> 00:48:10,343
Do you mind if I...?

643
00:48:10,507 --> 00:48:11,622
What?

644
00:48:12,187 --> 00:48:13,461
Sit down.

645
00:48:14,307 --> 00:48:15,706
Is it strong enough
to support us both?

646
00:48:15,867 --> 00:48:16,982
I hope.

647
00:48:18,867 --> 00:48:20,778
Let's swing a little.

648
00:48:21,787 --> 00:48:23,379
You seem all tense.

649
00:48:25,067 --> 00:48:27,262
Motion relaxes people.

650
00:48:28,227 --> 00:48:29,865
It's like a cradle.

651
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,616
A cradle relaxes a baby.

652
00:48:34,627 --> 00:48:36,106
They call you Baby, don't they?

653
00:48:36,267 --> 00:48:37,700
That's sort of a nickname.

654
00:48:37,907 --> 00:48:41,104
Well, in a swing you can relax
just like in a cradle.

655
00:48:41,347 --> 00:48:45,659
I don't like to swing. Besides,
I'm relaxed as much as necessary...

656
00:48:45,827 --> 00:48:49,024
No, you're not.
Your nerves are all tied up.

657
00:48:49,987 --> 00:48:50,897
You make me nervous.

658
00:48:51,067 --> 00:48:51,863
For swinging?

659
00:48:52,027 --> 00:48:53,096
Not just that.

660
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:54,302
What else, then?

661
00:48:54,467 --> 00:48:56,537
All those questions
about the fire.

662
00:48:58,507 --> 00:49:01,180
I was only enquiring
about your husband...

663
00:49:02,307 --> 00:49:04,775
about his leaving the house
after supper.

664
00:49:04,947 --> 00:49:07,905
There's no reason why I should
have to explain things to you.

665
00:49:09,307 --> 00:49:12,424
No. Should we just relax.

666
00:49:18,587 --> 00:49:20,100
Would you move over and
make a little room?

667
00:49:23,707 --> 00:49:25,299
Is that enough room for you?

668
00:49:25,467 --> 00:49:27,537
It is for me, how about you?

669
00:49:30,947 --> 00:49:33,302
It was a lovely remark
your husband made...

670
00:49:34,747 --> 00:49:36,897
the good neighbour policy,
I mean.

671
00:49:38,787 --> 00:49:42,177
"You do me a good turn
and I'll do you one. "

672
00:49:44,587 --> 00:49:46,145
That was the way he put it.

673
00:49:54,627 --> 00:49:55,855
There now.

674
00:49:56,667 --> 00:49:57,338
Thanks.

675
00:49:57,507 --> 00:50:00,783
There's a lot of fine cotton lint
floating in the air.

676
00:50:00,947 --> 00:50:03,177
I know. It bothers my sinus.

677
00:50:03,987 --> 00:50:06,785
You're a very delicate woman,
Mrs. Meighan.

678
00:50:08,467 --> 00:50:10,458
Delicate, me?

679
00:50:11,627 --> 00:50:15,461
There isn't much of you,
but what there is, is choice...

680
00:50:17,027 --> 00:50:18,858
delectable, I might say.

681
00:50:20,987 --> 00:50:23,023
You're fine fibred...

682
00:50:24,307 --> 00:50:25,945
soft...

683
00:50:26,547 --> 00:50:27,866
smooth...

684
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:34,136
This conversation really is
taking a personal turn.

685
00:50:34,307 --> 00:50:37,299
You make me think of cotton.
No...

686
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,785
No fabric or cloth...

687
00:50:41,947 --> 00:50:44,666
not even satin or silk...

688
00:50:46,227 --> 00:50:49,697
no kind of fibre,
not even a cotton fibre...

689
00:50:51,387 --> 00:50:54,424
has the absolute delicacy
of your skin.

690
00:50:55,067 --> 00:50:57,297
Should I say thanks, or something?

691
00:50:58,107 --> 00:51:02,658
Just smile.
You've got an attractive smile...

692
00:51:04,307 --> 00:51:06,980
And dimples...
Oh, yes, you do.

693
00:51:07,787 --> 00:51:09,300
Smile, Mrs. Meighan.

694
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:11,901
There, you see, you do have them.

695
00:51:12,747 --> 00:51:16,137
Please, don't touch me,
I don't like to be touched.

696
00:51:16,427 --> 00:51:18,179
Why do you giggle?

697
00:51:18,347 --> 00:51:21,305
You make me feel kind of hysterical.

698
00:51:21,947 --> 00:51:23,096
I do?

699
00:51:23,267 --> 00:51:24,495
Mr. Vacarro...

700
00:51:24,667 --> 00:51:25,861
Yes?

701
00:51:28,467 --> 00:51:30,935
I think I'll go and make us
some lemonade.

702
00:51:33,227 --> 00:51:34,899
What did you do that for?

703
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:39,024
I don't want to be deprived
of the pleasure of your company.

704
00:51:40,107 --> 00:51:41,222
Not yet.

705
00:51:43,107 --> 00:51:46,099
Mr. Vacarro, you certainly are
getting familiar.

706
00:51:46,627 --> 00:51:48,822
Don't you have a little
fun loving spirit?

707
00:51:48,987 --> 00:51:50,705
This isn't fun.

708
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:53,296
Why do you giggle, then?

709
00:51:53,507 --> 00:51:54,940
Because I'm ticklish.

710
00:51:55,107 --> 00:51:56,586
Ticklish?

711
00:51:57,947 --> 00:51:59,426
Don't be so skittish.

712
00:52:01,267 --> 00:52:03,178
All right, I'll get up then.

713
00:52:07,267 --> 00:52:08,780
Go on...

714
00:52:17,707 --> 00:52:19,618
I feel so weak.

715
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,746
My head is fuzzy.

716
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:37,936
Fuzzy?

717
00:52:40,867 --> 00:52:42,823
Fuzzy and buzzy...

718
00:52:49,627 --> 00:52:51,663
My head is swinging round.

719
00:52:57,227 --> 00:52:59,536
It must've been that swinging
that done it.

720
00:53:22,947 --> 00:53:24,096
Is there something on my arm?

721
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:25,780
No.

722
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:28,505
Cut it out, it feels funny.

723
00:53:28,667 --> 00:53:29,941
How does it feel?

724
00:53:30,627 --> 00:53:33,937
Feels funny all up and down.
Quit switching me.

725
00:53:34,107 --> 00:53:36,018
I'm just shooing the flies off.

726
00:53:36,347 --> 00:53:37,700
They don't hurt nothing.

727
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:40,623
Cut it out, or I'm gonna call.

728
00:53:40,787 --> 00:53:42,220
Call who?

729
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:44,942
The boy on the road.

730
00:53:45,107 --> 00:53:46,540
Go on, call then.

731
00:53:47,947 --> 00:53:48,936
Boy...

732
00:53:52,307 --> 00:53:54,343
Can't you call any louder?

733
00:53:54,507 --> 00:53:56,179
Can't you call any louder?

734
00:53:56,347 --> 00:54:00,135
I feel so funny.
What's the matter with me?

735
00:54:00,307 --> 00:54:03,822
Just relax.
Give in, stop fighting it.

736
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:07,782
I'm not. I'm not fighting.
It's you.

737
00:54:08,507 --> 00:54:10,020
and you're suspicions...

738
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:12,258
about my husband.

739
00:54:12,627 --> 00:54:14,458
Suspicions? Such as?

740
00:54:15,667 --> 00:54:17,146
That he burned down your gin.

741
00:54:17,307 --> 00:54:18,137
Well?

742
00:54:18,307 --> 00:54:19,535
He didn't.

743
00:54:19,707 --> 00:54:20,822
Didn't he?

744
00:54:20,987 --> 00:54:22,261
No, he didn't.

745
00:54:24,547 --> 00:54:26,105
He didn't.

746
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:28,578
I'm going in the house now.

747
00:54:29,707 --> 00:54:31,982
Do you believe in ghosts,
Mrs. Meighan?

748
00:54:32,507 --> 00:54:36,500
I do. I believe in the presence
of evil spirits.

749
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:39,058
What evil spirits
are you talking about?

750
00:54:39,307 --> 00:54:42,219
The spirits of violence
and cunning...

751
00:54:43,187 --> 00:54:46,224
malevolence, cruelty,
treachery...

752
00:54:47,107 --> 00:54:48,506
destruction.

753
00:54:48,667 --> 00:54:50,100
Them's just human characteristics.

754
00:54:51,547 --> 00:54:55,745
Evil spirits that haunt the human
heart and take possession of it.

755
00:54:56,427 --> 00:55:00,386
They spread from one human heart
to another...

756
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:03,505
the way a fire goes springing
from leaf to leaf...

757
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,862
branch to branch
in a tree...

758
00:55:06,027 --> 00:55:08,063
till the forest is
all aflame with it.

759
00:55:08,227 --> 00:55:10,183
You've just got fire on the brain.

760
00:55:10,427 --> 00:55:12,816
I see more than there seems to be
on the surface.

761
00:55:13,547 --> 00:55:16,857
I saw last night was an explosion
of those evil spirits.

762
00:55:17,387 --> 00:55:21,460
I fought it, I ran into it,
beating it, stamping it...

763
00:55:21,707 --> 00:55:23,504
shouting a curse of God at it.

764
00:55:24,227 --> 00:55:26,218
They dragged me out, suffocating.

765
00:55:26,547 --> 00:55:28,185
I was defeated.

766
00:55:28,707 --> 00:55:30,937
When I came to,
lying on the ground...

767
00:55:31,147 --> 00:55:33,024
the fire had won the battle.

768
00:55:33,427 --> 00:55:35,463
All around was a ring
of human faces.

769
00:55:36,547 --> 00:55:39,266
I looked up,
they were illuminated...

770
00:55:39,867 --> 00:55:42,779
their eyes and teeth
were shining like this...

771
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:44,822
yeah, like this...

772
00:55:44,987 --> 00:55:47,217
Don't, please, don't scare me.

773
00:55:48,107 --> 00:55:50,496
The faces I saw were grinning.

774
00:55:51,227 --> 00:55:52,785
Then I knew...

775
00:55:53,467 --> 00:55:56,265
I knew the fire
was not accidental.

776
00:55:57,387 --> 00:56:00,026
And you know
it was not accidental too.

777
00:56:01,027 --> 00:56:05,623
It was an expression, a manifestation
of the need to destroy.

778
00:56:06,267 --> 00:56:10,385
That's why I say I believe
in ghosts, in haunted places...

779
00:56:10,547 --> 00:56:12,936
in places haunted by the people
that occupy them...

780
00:56:13,107 --> 00:56:16,941
with hearts overrun by demons
of hate and destruction.

781
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:19,985
I believe this place,
this house, is haunted.

782
00:56:20,587 --> 00:56:22,782
Aunt Rose, Aunt Rose Comfort.

783
00:56:22,947 --> 00:56:24,539
This house is haunted.

784
00:56:25,187 --> 00:56:28,657
I think I'll go around the back door
and make us some lemonade.

785
00:56:30,187 --> 00:56:31,415
Archie Lee.

786
00:56:31,947 --> 00:56:32,902
Archie Lee?

787
00:56:33,067 --> 00:56:34,341
Archie Lee...

788
00:56:38,867 --> 00:56:40,778
Let's go and see Archie Lee now.

789
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:45,695
Archie Lee.

790
00:56:57,027 --> 00:56:58,460
What's going on up there?

791
00:56:58,627 --> 00:57:00,618
The contraption broke down.

792
00:57:17,587 --> 00:57:20,499
You better stay away from Archie,
he's fit to be tied.

793
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:26,338
Come on, give me that key.
Do you hear?

794
00:57:27,667 --> 00:57:30,977
Archie Lee,
I've got something to tell you.

795
00:57:31,747 --> 00:57:32,941
You left me over there.

796
00:57:33,107 --> 00:57:35,860
I told you never to come here
when niggers are working.

797
00:57:36,027 --> 00:57:37,460
You know...

798
00:57:39,667 --> 00:57:41,305
How's progress, Mr. Meighan?

799
00:57:42,627 --> 00:57:44,743
Fine, fine, great.

800
00:57:44,907 --> 00:57:47,421
Personally, I can't hear
the gin running at all.

801
00:57:48,307 --> 00:57:49,706
Big shot!

802
00:57:50,627 --> 00:57:51,582
What's going on?

803
00:57:51,747 --> 00:57:52,497
Nothing.

804
00:57:52,667 --> 00:57:54,578
What? Well, that figures.

805
00:57:54,747 --> 00:57:57,500
I inspected your equipment
before I put in my own.

806
00:57:57,667 --> 00:58:00,659
I put up my own gin because
this equipment was rotten.

807
00:58:01,427 --> 00:58:03,463
Was rotten, and still is rotten.

808
00:58:03,667 --> 00:58:06,659
It's quarter past two,
you've a lot of wagons out there.

809
00:58:06,827 --> 00:58:07,657
You Italians...

810
00:58:07,827 --> 00:58:09,419
Never mind about we Italians!

811
00:58:09,587 --> 00:58:11,145
Take it easy, now.

812
00:58:11,307 --> 00:58:13,741
Get a new saw cylinder
and get this contraption running.

813
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,262
If you can't get one in town,
go to Rosedale.

814
00:58:16,427 --> 00:58:18,099
If you can't get one in Rosedale...

815
00:58:18,347 --> 00:58:22,260
you better get across the river and
keep going right on to Little Rock.

816
00:58:22,427 --> 00:58:27,023
One more crack, and the only cotton
you'll see will be in a drugstore.

817
00:58:27,867 --> 00:58:29,858
Now, you better haul, brother.

818
00:58:47,707 --> 00:58:49,345
I've got something to say to you.

819
00:58:49,507 --> 00:58:51,463
I ain't got time.

820
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:54,865
Big shot! Big shot!
Big shot!

821
00:58:56,427 --> 00:58:58,577
Boy, he's really getting it.

822
00:58:59,227 --> 00:59:02,185
We've got a saw cylinder like this
in our commissary.

823
00:59:02,347 --> 00:59:05,020
Sure enough?
Go and bring it here...

824
00:59:05,187 --> 00:59:07,940
get Hank to help you put it in
and get this contraption running.

825
00:59:08,627 --> 00:59:12,302
He won't get one in town. If he
crosses the river, don't wait.

826
00:59:12,907 --> 00:59:14,226
Rock...

827
00:59:15,507 --> 00:59:17,543
I'll leave the pick-up truck
with you.

828
00:59:17,827 --> 00:59:21,502
Stay close to the house.
Stay there till I come out.

829
00:59:33,587 --> 00:59:35,020
Archie.

830
00:59:35,187 --> 00:59:37,417
Archie, wait!
Archie Lee!

831
00:59:55,987 --> 00:59:59,502
Please, don't touch me.

832
01:00:02,027 --> 01:00:05,064
Aunt Rose,
Aunt Rose Comfort.

833
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:09,015
I've got to go and see a mighty
sick friend in the county hospital.

834
01:00:12,307 --> 01:00:15,424
You might as well shout at the moon
as that old woman.

835
01:00:24,027 --> 01:00:25,506
You don't want her to go?

836
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:28,340
She's got no business
leaving me alone here.

837
01:00:31,587 --> 01:00:35,216
But she has a passion
for chocolate candies.

838
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:39,620
She watches the newspapers
like a hawk...

839
01:00:39,787 --> 01:00:43,746
to see if anyone she knows is
registered at the county hospital.

840
01:00:43,907 --> 01:00:45,579
Hospital?

841
01:00:46,867 --> 01:00:51,019
They pass out candy to the patients
at the county hospital, you know.

842
01:00:51,907 --> 01:00:55,502
Friends and relatives send them
flowers and candy.

843
01:00:56,707 --> 01:01:00,302
Aunt Rose goes to visit them and
eats up all the chocolate candy.

844
01:01:06,547 --> 01:01:11,462
Last week, an old lady friend of hers
was dying at the county hospital...

845
01:01:13,667 --> 01:01:16,101
and Aunt Rose Comfort
went to visit her...

846
01:01:16,387 --> 01:01:18,423
and ate up all her chocolate candy.

847
01:01:18,587 --> 01:01:19,986
All of it?

848
01:01:20,227 --> 01:01:22,297
Right while the old woman
was dying.

849
01:01:25,067 --> 01:01:28,104
I like old people, they're crazy.

850
01:01:34,507 --> 01:01:38,182
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

851
01:01:38,547 --> 01:01:40,185
What?

852
01:01:40,347 --> 01:01:42,702
Are you really married
to Mr. Meighan?

853
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:48,106
Mr. Vacarro, that is
a personal question.

854
01:01:48,427 --> 01:01:51,897
All questions are
more or less personal.

855
01:01:53,987 --> 01:01:55,306
Well...

856
01:01:59,667 --> 01:02:03,182
when I got married...

857
01:02:03,547 --> 01:02:06,937
I wasn't ready for marriage yet,
I was only 18.

858
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:11,617
But, my daddy was practically
on his death bed...

859
01:02:11,907 --> 01:02:14,467
and wanted to see me took care of
before he died.

860
01:02:15,387 --> 01:02:19,539
Archie Lee had been hanging around
like a sick dog for some time.

861
01:02:20,267 --> 01:02:22,576
And the boys around here
are a sorry lot.

862
01:02:22,747 --> 01:02:26,626
They ask you to the movies and
take you to a stone quarry instead.

863
01:02:27,107 --> 01:02:29,575
You've got to get out of the car
and throw stones at them.

864
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:32,056
I've had some experiences
with boys...

865
01:02:32,227 --> 01:02:34,297
that would just curl your hair
if I told you.

866
01:02:34,467 --> 01:02:37,459
The experiences
I've had with boys.

867
01:02:41,307 --> 01:02:44,424
Oh, but Archie Lee
was an older fella...

868
01:02:46,147 --> 01:02:48,502
and his business was better
in those days.

869
01:02:49,627 --> 01:02:53,415
He was ginning out most of the cotton
before you put up your gin, remember?

870
01:02:53,907 --> 01:02:55,784
I remember.

871
01:02:55,947 --> 01:02:58,984
Well, I told my daddy...

872
01:02:59,147 --> 01:03:01,456
I wasn't ready for marriage.

873
01:03:01,627 --> 01:03:04,505
My daddy told Archie Lee
I wasn't ready for it...

874
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:07,939
and Archie Lee
promised my daddy...

875
01:03:08,107 --> 01:03:10,337
that he would wait
until I was ready.

876
01:03:10,827 --> 01:03:12,818
Then the marriage was postponed.

877
01:03:13,307 --> 01:03:15,343
No, not the wedding.

878
01:03:16,987 --> 01:03:19,740
We had the wedding,
my daddy gave me away.

879
01:03:19,907 --> 01:03:21,704
But you said Archie Lee waited?

880
01:03:21,867 --> 01:03:23,664
Yes, after the wedding.

881
01:03:23,827 --> 01:03:25,180
For what?

882
01:03:32,667 --> 01:03:34,897
For me to be ready for marriage.

883
01:03:35,267 --> 01:03:37,542
How long did he have to wait?

884
01:03:37,707 --> 01:03:39,663
Oh, he's still waiting.

885
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:46,501
We had an agreement.

886
01:03:48,747 --> 01:03:52,137
I told him that on my 20th birthday,
I'd be ready.

887
01:03:52,507 --> 01:03:53,860
That's tomorrow.

888
01:03:55,267 --> 01:03:58,100
And, will you be ready?

889
01:04:00,747 --> 01:04:02,339
Well, that all depends.

890
01:04:02,747 --> 01:04:04,305
What on?

891
01:04:05,147 --> 01:04:07,866
Whether or not the furniture
comes back.

892
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:16,744
Your husband sweats more than any man
I know. Now, I understand why.

893
01:04:18,627 --> 01:04:20,106
Well, let's see.

894
01:04:20,387 --> 01:04:21,740
Well, I declare.

895
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,340
I'm sorry.

896
01:04:29,427 --> 01:04:32,180
There, now you wait right there.

897
01:04:32,347 --> 01:04:34,907
I'm going to make lemonade
and serve it on the porch.

898
01:04:35,067 --> 01:04:36,295
Yes, ma'am, right here.

899
01:04:36,467 --> 01:04:37,741
You wait right there.

900
01:04:39,347 --> 01:04:40,939
You wait right there.

901
01:04:41,107 --> 01:04:42,745
Yes, ma'am, I'll wait.

902
01:04:43,787 --> 01:04:46,824
I will stay right here.
Yes, ma'am.

903
01:05:12,267 --> 01:05:15,020
I'm going to get a fridge
one of these days.

904
01:05:19,347 --> 01:05:22,498
Stupid old thing.
Forgot to light the stove.

905
01:06:30,067 --> 01:06:31,580
Mr. Vacarro?

906
01:06:42,347 --> 01:06:44,383
We'll be having lemonade
in a minute.

907
01:06:50,227 --> 01:06:53,424
Here, how did you get
that pretty dress all wet?

908
01:07:17,907 --> 01:07:19,386
What a mess.

909
01:07:47,227 --> 01:07:49,946
Mr. Vacarro?
You wait right there.

910
01:07:54,427 --> 01:07:56,383
Archie Lee, is that you?

911
01:08:15,187 --> 01:08:16,461
Needs something.

912
01:10:34,107 --> 01:10:36,541
Get out of my house!

913
01:10:54,067 --> 01:10:57,696
Mr. Vacarro, I know that's you,
and you're making me very nervous.

914
01:11:13,507 --> 01:11:15,657
Help, help, help!.

915
01:12:01,867 --> 01:12:03,095
Open, sesame!

916
01:12:03,267 --> 01:12:04,586
Game's over, I quit.

917
01:12:04,867 --> 01:12:07,256
No, you have to keep playing
till you're it.

918
01:12:07,427 --> 01:12:12,376
Would you go back downstairs so I
can unlock this door and come out?

919
01:12:12,707 --> 01:12:14,777
This attic is in awful
weak condition.

920
01:12:14,947 --> 01:12:19,259
Shall I call the fire department to
come with a net to catch you?

921
01:12:19,427 --> 01:12:20,655
There wouldn't be time.

922
01:12:20,827 --> 01:12:22,863
I don't suppose they'd get here
on time.

923
01:12:23,067 --> 01:12:27,185
Any more than they did last night
when a fire burned down my gin.

924
01:12:30,587 --> 01:12:32,623
I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.

925
01:12:33,187 --> 01:12:36,497
I'm going to slip a pencil and paper
under this door.

926
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:38,817
All I want is your signature
on the paper.

927
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:39,544
What paper?

928
01:12:39,707 --> 01:12:42,016
An affidavit legally stating...

929
01:12:42,187 --> 01:12:44,747
that Archie Lee Meighan
burned down the syndicate gin.

930
01:12:47,347 --> 01:12:51,420
This floor is about to
give out right under me.

931
01:12:51,627 --> 01:12:52,503
It'll just take a minute.

932
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:56,376
Just leave it there. I'll be happy
to sign it and send it to you.

933
01:12:56,547 --> 01:13:00,222
I'm a Sicilian.
We're a very old race of people...

934
01:13:00,387 --> 01:13:03,618
and ancient races are
untrustful races by nature.

935
01:13:03,787 --> 01:13:07,575
Either you sign this piece of paper
or I'll break this door down.

936
01:13:09,027 --> 01:13:12,417
Do you hear me?
I gather you don't believe it.

937
01:13:23,147 --> 01:13:26,344
Either you agree
to sign this thing...

938
01:13:26,507 --> 01:13:28,384
or I'm coming out here...

939
01:13:28,547 --> 01:13:30,822
and my additional weight...

940
01:13:34,427 --> 01:13:35,746
What am I going to do?

941
01:13:36,067 --> 01:13:37,625
You'll do what I tell you.

942
01:13:45,987 --> 01:13:47,545
I'll do what you want...

943
01:13:48,307 --> 01:13:50,263
only hurry.

944
01:13:58,747 --> 01:13:59,782
What have I got to do?

945
01:14:00,267 --> 01:14:01,620
Write your name.

946
01:15:14,307 --> 01:15:15,820
You can come out now.

947
01:15:17,867 --> 01:15:20,017
What about the footsteps
on the stairs.

948
01:15:20,187 --> 01:15:21,381
Hear my descending
footsteps on the stairs.

949
01:15:21,547 --> 01:15:23,139
Mr. Vacarro.

950
01:15:24,467 --> 01:15:26,537
Do you hear my footsteps
on the stairs?

951
01:15:28,267 --> 01:15:30,098
Mr. Vacarro.

952
01:15:33,187 --> 01:15:35,985
OK, you're home free
and so am I. Bye-bye.

953
01:15:36,147 --> 01:15:38,183
Wait, where are you going?

954
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:41,700
Back to my little grey
Quonset home in the west...

955
01:15:42,227 --> 01:15:44,297
to take a peaceful siesta.

956
01:15:44,627 --> 01:15:46,140
But I want to...

957
01:15:47,027 --> 01:15:49,018
I want to...

958
01:15:52,907 --> 01:15:56,104
Is that all you wanted?

959
01:15:58,067 --> 01:16:00,581
For me to confess that Archie Lee
burned down your gin?

960
01:16:01,627 --> 01:16:03,822
What else did you imagine?

961
01:16:06,867 --> 01:16:08,186
Well...

962
01:16:20,107 --> 01:16:21,779
Mrs. Meighan...

963
01:16:24,387 --> 01:16:26,218
you're a child.

964
01:16:27,547 --> 01:16:30,505
That's why we played
hide and seek...

965
01:16:30,667 --> 01:16:32,737
it's a game for children.

966
01:16:35,027 --> 01:16:37,700
You don't have to go all
the way home to take a nap...

967
01:16:37,867 --> 01:16:39,539
you could take a nap here.

968
01:16:40,707 --> 01:16:42,425
It's going to rain anyhow.

969
01:16:46,347 --> 01:16:49,100
But all the furniture has
been removed from the house.

970
01:16:50,347 --> 01:16:52,383
Not the stuff in the nursery...

971
01:16:52,787 --> 01:16:55,540
there's a small bed in there,
a crib.

972
01:16:59,547 --> 01:17:03,859
You could curl up
and let the slats down...

973
01:17:12,467 --> 01:17:14,583
I'll be happy to accept
the invitation.

974
01:17:37,187 --> 01:17:39,576
Come up and sing me to sleep.

975
01:17:50,707 --> 01:17:53,824
My daddy would turn over
in his grave.

976
01:18:49,867 --> 01:18:52,665
Come on, I'm good for it.
You know I'm good for it.

977
01:18:52,827 --> 01:18:55,978
I'll take it somewhere else
if you don't want it!

978
01:18:56,147 --> 01:18:58,058
Listen, my daddy's watch.

979
01:18:58,267 --> 01:18:59,586
Cash.

980
01:19:00,307 --> 01:19:03,140
The letters of his name
instead of numbers.

981
01:19:03,387 --> 01:19:04,786
I'll leave this watch with you.

982
01:19:04,947 --> 01:19:07,381
- Cash.
- Give it him and get out of here.

983
01:19:09,227 --> 01:19:12,822
Thank you, sir.
I'm much obliged to you.

984
01:19:29,667 --> 01:19:33,182
Will you get this thing going?
Come on, will you?

985
01:19:33,347 --> 01:19:36,339
Shut up.
We're going as fast as we can.

986
01:19:58,267 --> 01:20:00,781
You all must've done some
mighty fast repairs.

987
01:20:00,947 --> 01:20:02,778
No repairs, we put in
a new saw cylinder.

988
01:20:02,947 --> 01:20:03,936
From where?

989
01:20:04,107 --> 01:20:05,904
The boss had one at our place.

990
01:20:06,227 --> 01:20:09,503
How come I wasn't let in
on this bit of information?

991
01:20:09,787 --> 01:20:12,540
I just about killed myself.
Where is that wop?

992
01:20:12,867 --> 01:20:15,222
I want an explanation.
Vacarro!

993
01:20:16,187 --> 01:20:17,381
Where is he?

994
01:20:17,547 --> 01:20:20,141
- Have you seen the boss?
- No.

995
01:20:20,307 --> 01:20:23,140
- Have you seen the boss?
- No, sir.

996
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:27,184
Where are my men?

997
01:20:27,347 --> 01:20:30,817
I sent them home.
They're useless.

998
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:34,504
You keep operating.

999
01:20:39,827 --> 01:20:42,057
You know,
this isn't a bad old gin.

1000
01:21:17,667 --> 01:21:19,225
Is anybody living here?

1001
01:21:23,347 --> 01:21:25,702
Is anybody still living
in this house?

1002
01:21:42,507 --> 01:21:43,781
It's Archie Lee.

1003
01:22:21,547 --> 01:22:23,697
What happened here?

1004
01:22:24,787 --> 01:22:26,015
What happened here?

1005
01:22:26,187 --> 01:22:27,745
The plaster broke.

1006
01:22:27,907 --> 01:22:31,217
But how, how?
How did that happen?

1007
01:22:31,387 --> 01:22:34,697
How does anything happen?
It just happens.

1008
01:22:37,307 --> 01:22:40,105
Ain't I told you not to
slop around in a slip?

1009
01:22:41,827 --> 01:22:44,978
Ain't I told you not to
slop around in a slip?

1010
01:22:45,267 --> 01:22:47,701
Supper's almost ready.

1011
01:22:53,747 --> 01:22:56,819
Breakage alone in that kitchen
would ruin a well to do man.

1012
01:22:57,667 --> 01:23:01,182
Go up and put some decent
clothes on and come back down.

1013
01:23:02,307 --> 01:23:06,619
There's a new bureau in Washington,
the U.W. bureau.

1014
01:23:06,787 --> 01:23:10,700
Do you know what it stands for?
Useless Women!

1015
01:23:11,707 --> 01:23:13,538
They've got secret plans to...

1016
01:23:16,027 --> 01:23:18,416
lock them up and shoot them.

1017
01:23:20,467 --> 01:23:23,823
Shoot them. You heard me,
I said shoot them.

1018
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:26,897
How about men
that's destructive?

1019
01:23:27,067 --> 01:23:30,946
Do you think they plan to round up
destructive men and shoot them?

1020
01:23:31,867 --> 01:23:34,017
What destructive men
are you talking about?

1021
01:23:34,187 --> 01:23:38,305
Men that blow things up
and burn things down.

1022
01:23:38,787 --> 01:23:42,621
Because they're too evil and stupid
to get along otherwise.

1023
01:23:43,267 --> 01:23:47,579
Competition is too much for them
so they turn criminal.

1024
01:23:48,907 --> 01:23:51,137
They do things like arson...

1025
01:23:51,627 --> 01:23:54,300
the wilful destruction
of property by fire.

1026
01:24:00,587 --> 01:24:01,576
Who said that to you?

1027
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:04,301
Look what's up there on the porch.

1028
01:24:05,107 --> 01:24:06,620
There's men on the road.

1029
01:24:06,787 --> 01:24:08,982
Who said arson?

1030
01:24:09,347 --> 01:24:14,057
Who spoke of wilful destruction?
You never knew them words.

1031
01:24:15,867 --> 01:24:20,577
Sometimes, big shot, you don't seem
to think I'm very intelligent.

1032
01:24:21,747 --> 01:24:24,386
I've been to school
in my life...

1033
01:24:24,547 --> 01:24:26,742
and I'm a magazine reader.

1034
01:24:34,307 --> 01:24:35,820
Who gave that whistle?

1035
01:24:35,987 --> 01:24:38,501
Who gave a wolf whistle
at my wife?

1036
01:24:39,107 --> 01:24:42,065
You just stay on that
side of that fence.

1037
01:24:42,227 --> 01:24:43,376
Stay over there!

1038
01:24:57,707 --> 01:25:00,983
Men from the syndicate plantation,
white and black, mixed...

1039
01:25:01,227 --> 01:25:03,821
heading for the river
with rubber boots on.

1040
01:25:03,987 --> 01:25:06,262
I just hope they turn
downstream...

1041
01:25:06,587 --> 01:25:09,147
I just hope turn that corner...

1042
01:25:09,587 --> 01:25:12,147
I'll blast them away
with a shotgun.

1043
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:14,104
Small dogs give a loud bark.

1044
01:25:14,267 --> 01:25:16,144
No one's going to insult
no woman of mine.

1045
01:25:16,467 --> 01:25:18,935
You take a lot for granted
when you say "mine".

1046
01:25:19,747 --> 01:25:23,422
I came to you today for protection
and what did I get?

1047
01:25:23,587 --> 01:25:25,225
Slapped and sent home.

1048
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:29,696
I'm telling you, the agreement
between us is over.

1049
01:25:30,107 --> 01:25:32,257
You're darn tooting it's over!

1050
01:25:32,467 --> 01:25:37,336
In three hours, the terms of our
agreement will be settled for good.

1051
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:38,337
Don't count on it.

1052
01:25:38,507 --> 01:25:39,656
Sharp, at midnight.

1053
01:25:39,827 --> 01:25:41,021
Too much has happened here
lately.

1054
01:25:41,187 --> 01:25:43,747
My credit is wide open again.

1055
01:25:43,947 --> 01:25:46,097
So is the jailhouse door,
if the truth be known.

1056
01:25:46,267 --> 01:25:47,700
Are you threatening me
with blabbing?

1057
01:25:54,947 --> 01:25:56,266
Archie Lee...

1058
01:25:56,707 --> 01:26:00,063
Mr. Vacarro says he might not
set up a new cotton gin...

1059
01:26:00,267 --> 01:26:02,861
he might let you gin out his cotton
all the time.

1060
01:26:03,027 --> 01:26:04,585
Ain't you pleased?

1061
01:26:05,427 --> 01:26:08,100
He'll come tomorrow
with lots more cotton.

1062
01:26:08,427 --> 01:26:11,260
And while you're ginning it out,
I'll entertain him...

1063
01:26:12,027 --> 01:26:14,097
I'll make lemonade for him.

1064
01:26:14,587 --> 01:26:17,784
It's going to go on and on,
maybe even till next fall.

1065
01:26:20,627 --> 01:26:23,380
It's the good neighbour policy
in practice.

1066
01:26:32,147 --> 01:26:34,103
How long have you
been on the place?

1067
01:26:34,307 --> 01:26:38,539
All this long fall afternoon,
I've imposed on your hospitality.

1068
01:26:44,587 --> 01:26:45,986
Where have you been?

1069
01:26:46,147 --> 01:26:49,184
Taking a nap on
the only remaining bed...

1070
01:26:49,347 --> 01:26:52,339
the crib in the nursery
with the slats let down.

1071
01:26:53,027 --> 01:26:55,097
Something sad about it,
know what I mean?

1072
01:26:55,747 --> 01:26:57,226
Sad?

1073
01:26:57,387 --> 01:27:00,106
An unoccupied nursery
in a house...

1074
01:27:00,267 --> 01:27:02,701
and all the other rooms, empty.

1075
01:27:04,627 --> 01:27:06,663
That's no problem of yours.

1076
01:27:06,827 --> 01:27:10,342
The good neighbour policy makes
your problems mine and vice versa.

1077
01:27:11,187 --> 01:27:12,745
Supper's ready, children.

1078
01:27:13,227 --> 01:27:16,344
Didn't you hear us
called into supper?

1079
01:27:19,627 --> 01:27:21,345
Are you going to eat here tonight?

1080
01:27:21,547 --> 01:27:23,981
Mrs. Meighan asked me
to stay for supper...

1081
01:27:24,387 --> 01:27:27,982
but I wanted to hear the invitation
from the head of the house...

1082
01:27:28,547 --> 01:27:30,777
before I'd feel free to accept.

1083
01:27:31,667 --> 01:27:33,498
What do you say?

1084
01:27:38,427 --> 01:27:40,099
Stay for supper.

1085
01:27:42,067 --> 01:27:43,546
You'll have to take pot luck.

1086
01:27:43,707 --> 01:27:45,584
I wouldn't be putting you out?

1087
01:27:49,067 --> 01:27:51,627
Excuse me, I better
get into my clothes.

1088
01:27:52,107 --> 01:27:54,746
Yes, that would be better.

1089
01:28:40,347 --> 01:28:43,066
Did I understand
you say that...

1090
01:28:47,147 --> 01:28:50,219
you wouldn't build a new gin but
would leave your business to me?

1091
01:28:50,387 --> 01:28:51,456
If that's agreeable...

1092
01:28:51,627 --> 01:28:52,980
I don't know.

1093
01:28:56,387 --> 01:28:58,537
I've got to consider the matter.

1094
01:28:59,387 --> 01:29:03,539
Financing is involved,
new equipment...

1095
01:29:07,307 --> 01:29:08,706
Let's go and eat now.

1096
01:29:10,307 --> 01:29:12,821
I've got a pain in my belly.
Sort of...

1097
01:29:14,147 --> 01:29:15,819
heart burn.

1098
01:29:22,547 --> 01:29:24,617
Hey, one more plate
at the table.

1099
01:29:25,027 --> 01:29:27,985
Mr. Vacarro of the syndicate
plantation is staying for supper.

1100
01:29:28,147 --> 01:29:32,459
I had no idea company was expected,
I'll just change...

1101
01:29:32,627 --> 01:29:35,300
Another place is all
that's called for.

1102
01:29:40,267 --> 01:29:41,859
Have you been here all day?

1103
01:29:42,027 --> 01:29:46,020
Have you been here or did you go
to the hospital to eat chocolate?

1104
01:29:46,187 --> 01:29:48,576
Yes, I visited a friend
in the hospital.

1105
01:29:48,747 --> 01:29:50,738
Then you were out...

1106
01:29:51,827 --> 01:29:53,897
while I worked like
the hammers of hell!

1107
01:29:54,067 --> 01:29:57,901
I come home to find the attic floor
fell through, my wife insulting...

1108
01:29:58,067 --> 01:30:01,503
and a supper of hog slops!

1109
01:30:04,547 --> 01:30:07,584
Sit down, I've got to
make me a phone call.

1110
01:30:15,947 --> 01:30:19,622
Hello, Miss Hopkins,
give me the Bright Spot.

1111
01:30:20,587 --> 01:30:23,101
I can't think of the number,
you give it to me.

1112
01:30:28,827 --> 01:30:31,102
Hello, Bright Spot?

1113
01:30:33,107 --> 01:30:35,780
He's on the phone. If I was you
I wouldn't hang around.

1114
01:30:35,947 --> 01:30:37,699
I've got the ace of spades
in my pocket...

1115
01:30:37,867 --> 01:30:39,937
and I'm not going to give in.

1116
01:30:40,107 --> 01:30:41,586
Don't count on the law court...

1117
01:30:41,747 --> 01:30:43,544
justice here is as deaf and blind
as that old woman.

1118
01:30:43,707 --> 01:30:45,663
I'll do my own justice.

1119
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:49,895
Get Eddie, Bill,
Butch, Rhodes, anyone.

1120
01:30:51,227 --> 01:30:53,695
Go while he's on the phone.

1121
01:30:53,867 --> 01:30:56,665
You don't know his friends,
they're awful.

1122
01:30:56,827 --> 01:30:58,146
I've seen them.

1123
01:31:00,067 --> 01:31:03,343
I find you different this evening
in some way.

1124
01:31:04,787 --> 01:31:08,541
Never mind that.
Go, while he's on the phone.

1125
01:31:08,907 --> 01:31:10,704
Grown up, suddenly.

1126
01:31:20,147 --> 01:31:22,615
There's no place he can run to
in this county.

1127
01:31:23,987 --> 01:31:26,023
You can say that again, boy.

1128
01:31:55,067 --> 01:31:58,025
If you can't leave the place,
send someone.

1129
01:31:58,307 --> 01:32:00,821
Send someone to find him,
do you hear me?

1130
01:32:03,427 --> 01:32:04,780
I'll call you back.

1131
01:32:05,707 --> 01:32:07,299
Poems of nature.

1132
01:32:07,467 --> 01:32:08,946
Never mind poems of nature.

1133
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:10,665
I'll call you later.

1134
01:32:12,747 --> 01:32:15,056
If I'd only known...

1135
01:32:15,267 --> 01:32:16,256
Put food on the table.

1136
01:32:16,467 --> 01:32:17,138
Just a minute.

1137
01:32:17,307 --> 01:32:19,104
We ain't gonna wait
no minute.

1138
01:32:23,427 --> 01:32:25,383
Bring out some food!

1139
01:32:43,347 --> 01:32:47,863
Is that what they call a Mona Lisa
smile you've got on your puss?

1140
01:32:51,507 --> 01:32:53,623
Put some food on the table!

1141
01:32:53,787 --> 01:32:56,301
Don't pick on Aunt Rose Comfort.

1142
01:32:56,627 --> 01:32:58,777
I'll talk to that woman right now.

1143
01:32:59,467 --> 01:33:01,298
She's outstayed her welcome.

1144
01:33:05,307 --> 01:33:08,299
What a pretty blue ribbon you're
wearing tonight, Mrs. Meighan.

1145
01:33:09,827 --> 01:33:11,863
Thank you, Mr. Vacarro.

1146
01:33:12,427 --> 01:33:14,497
There's so many shades
of blue.

1147
01:33:15,587 --> 01:33:17,737
What particular shade is that?

1148
01:33:17,907 --> 01:33:19,340
It's just baby blue.

1149
01:33:21,947 --> 01:33:24,063
It brings out the blue
in your eyes.

1150
01:33:24,227 --> 01:33:25,342
Food!

1151
01:33:26,547 --> 01:33:28,105
Food!

1152
01:33:32,587 --> 01:33:34,498
This was part of my trousseau.

1153
01:33:35,307 --> 01:33:39,937
I got my trousseau at various stores
in Memphis where my daddy was known.

1154
01:33:41,347 --> 01:33:43,463
What is this stuff? Grass?

1155
01:33:43,747 --> 01:33:46,307
Greens. Don't you know greens
when you see them?

1156
01:33:46,547 --> 01:33:49,619
Big department stores
on Main Street...

1157
01:33:49,907 --> 01:33:51,625
This stuff is greens?

1158
01:33:51,787 --> 01:33:54,620
Archie Lee dotes on greens,
don't you?

1159
01:33:54,787 --> 01:33:55,822
No, I don't.

1160
01:33:56,267 --> 01:33:58,417
You don't dote on greens?

1161
01:33:59,147 --> 01:34:00,216
Somebody did...

1162
01:34:00,387 --> 01:34:04,300
Probably, sometime, somewhere.
That don't mean it was me.

1163
01:34:04,787 --> 01:34:08,382
Eat your greens, big shot.
They put iron in the blood.

1164
01:34:09,027 --> 01:34:13,976
I thought he doted on greens.
His likes are hard to keep straight.

1165
01:34:14,947 --> 01:34:16,665
Archie Lee is easy to cook for.

1166
01:34:16,827 --> 01:34:18,624
Take this slop off the table.

1167
01:34:19,747 --> 01:34:22,056
I'll cook you some
eggs Birmingham.

1168
01:34:22,507 --> 01:34:24,543
These greens didn't cook enough.

1169
01:34:24,707 --> 01:34:29,098
I played a fool trick with my stove,
I forgot to light it.

1170
01:34:31,747 --> 01:34:36,263
I left my greens on the stove.
I thought they were boiling.

1171
01:34:36,507 --> 01:34:39,943
When I came home, I discovered
my stove wasn't lit.

1172
01:34:40,427 --> 01:34:43,863
Why do you say "my stove"?
Why is everything "mine"?

1173
01:34:44,027 --> 01:34:45,255
I think you've been drinking.

1174
01:34:46,067 --> 01:34:47,420
You stay out of this.

1175
01:34:47,587 --> 01:34:49,225
Sit down, Aunt Rose.

1176
01:34:50,987 --> 01:34:52,181
What was that, Archie?

1177
01:34:52,827 --> 01:34:53,976
Sit down.

1178
01:34:54,547 --> 01:34:55,696
Where?

1179
01:35:01,227 --> 01:35:02,455
Sit here.

1180
01:35:10,707 --> 01:35:12,345
I'm gonna ask you a question.

1181
01:35:15,987 --> 01:35:18,217
What sort of plans have you made?

1182
01:35:19,147 --> 01:35:21,866
What plans? What sort
of plans do you mean?

1183
01:35:22,027 --> 01:35:23,426
Plans for the future.

1184
01:35:23,587 --> 01:35:27,262
I don't think this discussion
is necessary in front of company.

1185
01:35:27,427 --> 01:35:31,545
Mrs. Meighan, when someone feels
uncomfortable over something...

1186
01:35:31,827 --> 01:35:34,899
it often happens he takes out
his annoyance...

1187
01:35:35,267 --> 01:35:37,986
on some completely
innocent person.

1188
01:35:48,947 --> 01:35:50,266
Now, Aunt Rose...

1189
01:35:51,227 --> 01:35:54,105
you've been here since August,
that's a mighty long stay.

1190
01:35:58,507 --> 01:36:01,146
It's my honest opinion that
you are in need of a rest.

1191
01:36:02,147 --> 01:36:05,856
You've been cooking here and
cooking there for how long?

1192
01:36:08,027 --> 01:36:09,221
Well?

1193
01:36:09,747 --> 01:36:12,625
How long have you been cooking
in people's houses?

1194
01:36:13,587 --> 01:36:18,502
I've helped out my relatives
whenever they needed me.

1195
01:36:19,387 --> 01:36:22,857
I was always invited, sometimes,
begged to come.

1196
01:36:24,107 --> 01:36:26,496
When babies were expected or
somebody was sick...

1197
01:36:26,667 --> 01:36:29,625
they called for Aunt Rose
and she was always there.

1198
01:36:31,507 --> 01:36:34,943
Nobody ever had
to put me out.

1199
01:36:37,907 --> 01:36:40,944
Would you excuse me
for a minute...

1200
01:36:43,707 --> 01:36:46,096
I'll go up and pack.

1201
01:36:51,467 --> 01:36:54,186
Miss Rose Comfort, wait.

1202
01:36:56,827 --> 01:36:58,419
I'll drive you home.

1203
01:36:58,747 --> 01:37:00,624
I've got nowhere to go.

1204
01:37:00,787 --> 01:37:02,015
Yes, you do.

1205
01:37:02,707 --> 01:37:04,663
I need a cook.

1206
01:37:05,147 --> 01:37:06,899
I'm tired of my own cooking.

1207
01:37:07,067 --> 01:37:10,696
And I'm anxious to try those
eggs Birmingham you mentioned.

1208
01:37:12,067 --> 01:37:13,216
Is it a deal?

1209
01:37:15,907 --> 01:37:16,623
Well...

1210
01:37:16,787 --> 01:37:18,857
Sure it's a deal, Aunt Rose.

1211
01:37:19,027 --> 01:37:21,416
Mr. Vacarro
will be very good to you.

1212
01:37:22,107 --> 01:37:24,667
You never can tell about
things in the future.

1213
01:37:26,347 --> 01:37:30,465
Yes. I'm going to pack
my things.

1214
01:37:48,907 --> 01:37:52,217
Is there anything else around here
you want to take away?

1215
01:37:57,667 --> 01:37:58,861
Well, is there?

1216
01:37:59,027 --> 01:38:00,699
Yes, Archie Lee.

1217
01:38:01,347 --> 01:38:05,704
Mr. Vacarro noticed that the house
was just full of furniture.

1218
01:38:06,867 --> 01:38:10,780
He'd like to borrow about
five complete sets of it.

1219
01:38:54,747 --> 01:38:57,136
Coloured folks call this
pot liquor.

1220
01:38:59,147 --> 01:39:01,183
I love pot liquor

1221
01:39:04,267 --> 01:39:05,541
Good?

1222
01:39:07,147 --> 01:39:09,263
I'm crazy about pot liquor.

1223
01:39:14,267 --> 01:39:15,666
Is it good?

1224
01:39:22,347 --> 01:39:22,938
Good.

1225
01:39:23,107 --> 01:39:24,984
I love it.

1226
01:39:29,267 --> 01:39:32,100
That hen thought she'd been
invited to supper.

1227
01:39:42,827 --> 01:39:45,739
Listen to me!
You all listen to me.

1228
01:39:46,107 --> 01:39:50,066
Quit giving those filthy looks
back and forth and listen to me.

1229
01:39:50,667 --> 01:39:54,945
Do you think I'm deaf,
dumb and blind? Do you?

1230
01:39:56,267 --> 01:39:59,737
Well, you're mistook.
Oh, brother.

1231
01:40:00,187 --> 01:40:02,701
Oh, brother,
you're mighty mistook.

1232
01:40:02,867 --> 01:40:06,064
I know, I know I guess
I look like a...

1233
01:40:08,027 --> 01:40:09,858
I guess I look like...

1234
01:40:10,027 --> 01:40:11,938
What do you guess you look like?

1235
01:40:12,107 --> 01:40:14,940
Some sweet, innocent,
Baby Doll of a wife...

1236
01:40:15,107 --> 01:40:16,859
not ready for marriage.

1237
01:40:17,027 --> 01:40:20,940
No, not ready for marriage.
But plenty ready to go out and...

1238
01:40:21,747 --> 01:40:24,056
Wait a minute.
How's it funny?

1239
01:40:24,507 --> 01:40:26,179
It sure is funny, huh?

1240
01:40:27,827 --> 01:40:30,944
There's one little thing
you've overlooked.

1241
01:40:31,987 --> 01:40:34,296
I've got position.

1242
01:40:35,227 --> 01:40:38,503
I've got position in this county
where I was born and brought up.

1243
01:40:39,747 --> 01:40:41,977
I hold a respected position.

1244
01:40:42,547 --> 01:40:45,584
Life long member of every
organisation in the delta.

1245
01:40:47,507 --> 01:40:51,261
And I have friends!
Friends!

1246
01:40:52,187 --> 01:40:55,338
Long standing business associates
and social.

1247
01:40:56,747 --> 01:41:00,945
See what I mean? You ain't got
that advantage, have you?

1248
01:41:01,827 --> 01:41:03,897
Have you? Have you?

1249
01:41:04,627 --> 01:41:06,936
Come on, speak up.

1250
01:41:07,587 --> 01:41:10,545
Ain't you a dago?
Excuse me, Italian?

1251
01:41:10,707 --> 01:41:13,460
I'm not a doctor, but I was in
medical corps in the navy.

1252
01:41:13,627 --> 01:41:16,664
You've got a very unhealthy look.
Call an ambulance.

1253
01:41:16,827 --> 01:41:20,581
I don't have to make a phone call
I can handle the situation myself.

1254
01:41:20,747 --> 01:41:21,577
What situation?

1255
01:41:21,747 --> 01:41:24,898
The situation I've come home
to find here under my roof.

1256
01:41:32,707 --> 01:41:34,186
Look here, now...

1257
01:41:37,507 --> 01:41:41,819
I'm not such an old fool
I couldn't size it up.

1258
01:41:45,027 --> 01:41:49,305
I sized it up the minute I seen
you were still on this place...

1259
01:41:52,107 --> 01:41:55,895
and her with that sly smile on her,
and you with yours on you.

1260
01:41:56,067 --> 01:41:57,898
Well, I know how to wipe off
both those sly smiles.

1261
01:41:58,067 --> 01:42:01,776
Meighan!
You know, and I know...

1262
01:42:01,947 --> 01:42:03,858
and I know you know
that I know...

1263
01:42:04,027 --> 01:42:06,587
that you set fire to
my cotton gin last night.

1264
01:42:07,347 --> 01:42:09,815
You burned down
the syndicate gin...

1265
01:42:10,707 --> 01:42:14,336
and I've got here in my hand
a signed affidavit...

1266
01:42:14,507 --> 01:42:16,941
a paper, signed by a witness...

1267
01:42:17,107 --> 01:42:20,941
whose testimony will hold up even
in the law court of Tiger Tail.

1268
01:42:22,027 --> 01:42:25,303
That's what I came here for
and that's all I got.

1269
01:42:25,547 --> 01:42:29,620
Whatever else you suspect,
you're mistaken.

1270
01:42:30,747 --> 01:42:32,180
Isn't that so?

1271
01:42:32,347 --> 01:42:34,986
Isn't your husband mistaken in
thinking I got anything...

1272
01:42:35,147 --> 01:42:39,060
but this signed affidavit which
was the purpose of my whole call?

1273
01:42:41,067 --> 01:42:44,946
I'm foreign, Meighan,
but not revengeful...

1274
01:42:45,307 --> 01:42:47,377
at least, not more
than is rightful.

1275
01:42:48,627 --> 01:42:51,744
We've got a workable good
neighbour policy between us.

1276
01:42:51,947 --> 01:42:55,576
It might work out. Anyhow,
I think it deserves a try.

1277
01:42:56,587 --> 01:42:59,624
As for the other side of the
situation which I won't mention...

1278
01:42:59,787 --> 01:43:04,736
all I'll say is a certain attraction
exists, mutually, I believe.

1279
01:43:05,787 --> 01:43:09,018
I needed a little shut-eye
after last night's excitement...

1280
01:43:09,187 --> 01:43:12,896
and I have a faint recollection
of being sung to by someone...

1281
01:43:14,467 --> 01:43:18,938
a lullaby that was sweet,
and the touch of cool fingers.

1282
01:43:21,267 --> 01:43:23,542
But that's all, absolutely.

1283
01:43:23,707 --> 01:43:24,822
You think I'll put up with this...?

1284
01:43:24,987 --> 01:43:26,625
Situation?

1285
01:43:26,907 --> 01:43:30,263
You went to a whole lot of risk
to get my business back.

1286
01:43:30,547 --> 01:43:32,344
Don't you want it?

1287
01:43:32,547 --> 01:43:34,060
It's up to you.

1288
01:43:34,227 --> 01:43:36,138
Very cool.

1289
01:43:37,107 --> 01:43:39,746
You just fixed your wagon...

1290
01:43:39,907 --> 01:43:43,786
with your smart talk
you just fixed your wagon.

1291
01:43:44,387 --> 01:43:49,336
I'm gonna wipe that grin off
your greasy wop face for good.

1292
01:43:52,707 --> 01:43:55,505
Is my wop face greasy,
Mrs. Meighan?

1293
01:44:25,027 --> 01:44:28,497
That's the last time you'll
ever lay your hands on me!

1294
01:44:28,667 --> 01:44:31,261
You stinking stinker!
Stinker!

1295
01:44:31,867 --> 01:44:33,380
Don't shoot him!

1296
01:44:37,027 --> 01:44:40,064
Rock...
Rock, where are you?

1297
01:44:41,667 --> 01:44:44,056
Where are you, Vacarro,
where are you?

1298
01:44:53,467 --> 01:44:56,186
If you're under there,
you ain't getting out.

1299
01:45:04,147 --> 01:45:05,865
My husband's got a gun
and I just don't know...

1300
01:45:17,507 --> 01:45:20,897
Hey, wop!
Yellow bellied wop!

1301
01:45:30,107 --> 01:45:32,667
Get the gun,
get the gun away from him!

1302
01:45:43,187 --> 01:45:45,303
Help!

1303
01:45:58,027 --> 01:46:01,337
Get away.
Where are you, Vacarro?

1304
01:46:02,067 --> 01:46:03,739
I'm right here.

1305
01:46:08,467 --> 01:46:10,503
There you are.

1306
01:46:16,387 --> 01:46:18,947
Oh, it's you. Excuse me.

1307
01:46:20,427 --> 01:46:21,496
Silva.

1308
01:46:24,707 --> 01:46:25,696
Here.

1309
01:46:25,867 --> 01:46:27,823
Where are you, Vacarro?

1310
01:46:28,667 --> 01:46:29,656
Come on.

1311
01:46:36,907 --> 01:46:38,306
Baby Doll!

1312
01:46:43,947 --> 01:46:45,505
Where are you, Vacarro?

1313
01:46:47,907 --> 01:46:49,465
Where are you?

1314
01:46:51,067 --> 01:46:52,386
Vacarro.

1315
01:46:52,547 --> 01:46:53,900
Vacarro!

1316
01:47:00,947 --> 01:47:03,415
Now, you put that gun away.

1317
01:47:23,667 --> 01:47:25,259
Baby Doll!

1318
01:47:26,427 --> 01:47:28,145
Baby...

1319
01:47:29,667 --> 01:47:31,544
Baby Doll...

1320
01:47:49,027 --> 01:47:51,587
Vacarro...

1321
01:47:52,427 --> 01:47:54,861
where are you,
you wop?

1322
01:48:05,467 --> 01:48:06,536
Baby...

1323
01:48:16,627 --> 01:48:17,901
Baby Doll...

1324
01:49:04,027 --> 01:49:06,746
I'm ready.
I'm all ready to go.

1325
01:49:10,547 --> 01:49:11,662
Who is that?

1326
01:49:13,227 --> 01:49:14,865
What's the matter, Sandy?

1327
01:49:15,027 --> 01:49:19,543
Tomorrow's election day, I'm running
for town marshal, I want your vote.

1328
01:49:19,747 --> 01:49:21,863
You've got my vote.

1329
01:49:25,307 --> 01:49:28,026
You're too old for
a job like that...

1330
01:49:28,267 --> 01:49:31,737
I'm 20 years younger and I wouldn't
run for a job like that...

1331
01:49:32,467 --> 01:49:34,219
Age is a factor that calls
for recognition.

1332
01:49:34,387 --> 01:49:38,699
I hope you recognise it's
a factor that calls for recognition.

1333
01:49:39,387 --> 01:49:42,538
A man grows old suddenly,
not gradually...

1334
01:49:42,907 --> 01:49:44,818
just, all of a sudden,
he's old.

1335
01:49:46,627 --> 01:49:49,187
Wait a minute,
where are you guys taking me?

1336
01:49:49,427 --> 01:49:51,019
You're acting as though
I'm under arrest.

1337
01:49:51,187 --> 01:49:51,778
You've been shooting.

1338
01:49:51,947 --> 01:49:53,266
There he is.

1339
01:49:56,427 --> 01:49:57,780
Get down...

1340
01:49:58,787 --> 01:50:01,585
- Get off me.
- Right, right, come on.

1341
01:50:09,987 --> 01:50:11,625
Hey, what about me?

1342
01:50:12,867 --> 01:50:14,459
Put the handcuffs on him.

1343
01:50:15,507 --> 01:50:20,217
OK. Put me in
that stinking black calaboose.

1344
01:50:20,387 --> 01:50:23,618
I ain't a white man?
No, so throw me in.

1345
01:50:24,707 --> 01:50:26,743
But, don't you leave
my Baby Doll here with him.

1346
01:50:27,307 --> 01:50:30,105
Don't you leave him here
with her.

1347
01:50:30,987 --> 01:50:34,536
You're a married man.
You understand how I feel.

1348
01:50:35,107 --> 01:50:39,225
Don't you, Sandy? Please.
As one white man to another.

1349
01:50:40,507 --> 01:50:43,101
Just for tonight,
don't leave them on the place.

1350
01:50:44,267 --> 01:50:45,700
Just tonight, Sandy.

1351
01:50:50,027 --> 01:50:52,461
I've scratched my leg
on the bark of that tree.

1352
01:50:52,987 --> 01:50:54,500
Vacarro, come here.

1353
01:50:54,667 --> 01:50:55,861
Excuse me.

1354
01:50:58,587 --> 01:51:00,259
What have you got on your mind?

1355
01:51:00,427 --> 01:51:03,976
Listen, we ain't got nothing
to hold that old boy on.

1356
01:51:04,147 --> 01:51:07,981
He's been shooting, but he says a
fox has been catching his chickens.

1357
01:51:08,147 --> 01:51:10,786
His chickens?
I've got a signed confession...

1358
01:51:10,947 --> 01:51:12,938
by a material witness
that amounts to an affidavit.

1359
01:51:13,107 --> 01:51:13,664
Let me see.

1360
01:51:13,827 --> 01:51:15,499
Not till it's witnessed
and photographed.

1361
01:51:15,667 --> 01:51:17,020
We'll have it photographed.

1362
01:51:17,187 --> 01:51:19,417
I don't need or want
anything from you.

1363
01:51:19,627 --> 01:51:22,460
I'm going to the county sheriff.
Rock!

1364
01:51:23,307 --> 01:51:25,059
Here, Silva.

1365
01:51:27,107 --> 01:51:29,667
Silva, what about me?

1366
01:51:29,827 --> 01:51:31,180
Now?

1367
01:51:33,947 --> 01:51:36,939
I'll be coming back tomorrow
with lots more cotton.

1368
01:51:38,827 --> 01:51:41,261
I'll be back
with lots more cotton.

1369
01:51:55,907 --> 01:51:57,386
Well, he's gone.

1370
01:51:57,547 --> 01:51:58,377
What happens now?

1371
01:51:58,547 --> 01:52:01,857
He's shown us a signed confession
from your wife...

1372
01:52:02,587 --> 01:52:05,147
we'll have to go through this thing
for appearance sake.

1373
01:52:05,787 --> 01:52:07,903
I don't mean that,
I mean...

1374
01:52:11,507 --> 01:52:12,940
What happens tomorrow?

1375
01:52:14,507 --> 01:52:18,466
Well, a town marshal has no control
over tomorrow.

1376
01:52:41,027 --> 01:52:43,063
Today's my Baby Doll's birthday.

1377
01:52:51,507 --> 01:52:53,304
Your friend has forgotten me.

1378
01:52:56,547 --> 01:53:00,506
Archie Lee, it looks like
the celebration is over.

1379
01:53:01,187 --> 01:53:02,415
Let's go.

1380
01:53:04,467 --> 01:53:07,186
He's coming back tomorrow
with more cotton.

1381
01:53:07,347 --> 01:53:09,019
He's coming back?

1382
01:53:27,827 --> 01:53:29,579
Let's go in now.

1383
01:53:32,227 --> 01:53:35,344
We've got nothing to do,
but wait for tomorrow.

1384
01:53:37,187 --> 01:53:40,975
And see if we're remembered...

1385
01:53:41,787 --> 01:53:43,106
or forgotten.

1386
01:54:00,507 --> 01:54:02,338
Oh, my, oh my.

1387
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:06,080
