1
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,685
Hey, Wiglow!

2
00:01:54,856 --> 00:01:55,892
Yes, sir.

3
00:01:56,058 --> 00:01:56,969
Can you hear me?

4
00:01:57,139 --> 00:01:58,575
Yes, sir.

5
00:01:58,742 --> 00:01:59,732
Can you find the holes?

6
00:01:59,904 --> 00:02:00,894
Yes, sir.

7
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:02,587
Make sure you get the big ones.

8
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:03,865
Yes, sir.

9
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:16,280
Ain't you got nothing to do?

10
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:17,804
Not a thing.

11
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:21,969
Ain't you going to help him?

12
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:23,571
I'm retired.

13
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,434
Baby Doll.

14
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,685
Archie Lee, you're a mess.

15
00:04:09,176 --> 00:04:12,332
Do you know what they call
such people? Peeping Toms!

16
00:04:15,826 --> 00:04:18,628
Ain't there a name for a woman
that sleeps in a baby's crib...

17
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,272
to stay away from her husband?

18
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:22,905
I'm gonna plug up the hole
in that wall...

19
00:04:23,077 --> 00:04:26,712
and if I ever catch you again
peeking at me in my sleep...

20
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:29,002
I'm moving into the
Kotton King Hotel.

21
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,881
And keep your filthy dogs
off my furniture!

22
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:37,770
Let me talk with you.
I want to talk with you.

23
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,064
Save your breath to drum up business
for your cotton gin...

24
00:04:42,747 --> 00:04:44,627
Close that door
so I can get dressed.

25
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,941
Go on, get dressed.

26
00:04:46,112 --> 00:04:49,234
Not until you get on the other
side of that door and close it.

27
00:04:49,397 --> 00:04:52,519
Today is the 5th of November,
tomorrow's the 6th...

28
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:54,755
and the day after is the 7th.

29
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:57,124
You know what day that is,
don't you?

30
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:00,964
November 7th is your
20th birthday.

31
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:05,053
Sweet of you to remember.
Where's my birthday present?

32
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,223
You'll get your birthday present...

33
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:10,743
providing you haven't forgotten
the agreement between us...

34
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,908
which comes due on that day.

35
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,237
The agreement?

36
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,113
Yes, the agreement.

37
00:05:19,281 --> 00:05:21,560
You swore on the Bible
to keep your side.

38
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:23,046
If you kept yours.

39
00:05:23,207 --> 00:05:24,528
Have I laid a hand on you?

40
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:27,002
Yes, as often as possible...

41
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:31,378
Have I? Have I ever once
forced myself on you?

42
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,858
As your husband, by law.
Or don't the law mean nothing to you?

43
00:05:36,027 --> 00:05:38,180
How about your side
of the agreement?

44
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,065
You talked mighty big
when you were courting me...

45
00:05:42,236 --> 00:05:46,030
you told my daddy you'd put me
in the grandest house in the county.

46
00:05:46,202 --> 00:05:49,677
I put you in Tiger Tail,
I bought it and put you in it.

47
00:05:49,847 --> 00:05:52,285
Tiger Tail is the grandest house
in the county.

48
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:56,245
Yes, the biggest old wreck
of a place in the whole delta.

49
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:58,650
You said you were going
to restore this place...

50
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,657
exactly how it was before,
only better...

51
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:05,186
make a show place, you said.
Yeah, a freak-show!

52
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,347
I've got my man on the roof now.
Can't you hear the hammer?

53
00:06:10,518 --> 00:06:13,674
Is that a hammer? I thought
it was a king size termite.

54
00:06:13,843 --> 00:06:16,280
If you ain't the most
ungrateful little...

55
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:19,965
I have mortgaged myself
to satisfy your demands.

56
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:24,491
You told lies to my daddy
in order to get me.

57
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:27,422
Get you?
I ain't got you yet.

58
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,424
And you ain't about to either.

59
00:06:30,588 --> 00:06:34,473
I'm telling you that if
the Ideal Furniture Company...

60
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:37,915
removes those five sets
of furniture from this house...

61
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,873
that agreement you spoke about
is automatically cancelled.

62
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:45,646
Now, would you kindly
go back in your own room?

63
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:50,167
I'm gonna get me a good job
while I'm in town today...

64
00:06:50,738 --> 00:06:54,783
just in case,
just in case.

65
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,804
Admiring yourself in the mirror!
Just look at yourself.

66
00:07:10,287 --> 00:07:14,172
You're not exactly a young girl's
dream come true.

67
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:17,656
There was an old witch
named Granny Crow...

68
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:21,533
wherever she spit,
no grass would grow.

69
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:27,066
That old witch must've spit
on the top of your head.

70
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:33,361
Thank you, thank you.

71
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:39,642
You're a woman not grown,
therefore I'll make allowances.

72
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:45,487
Aunt Rose screams
every time the phone rings.

73
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,337
What does she do
a fool thing like that for?

74
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:50,179
The phone ringing scares her.

75
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:53,184
Aunt Rose, why don't you
answer the phone?

76
00:07:57,357 --> 00:07:59,636
Aunt Rose.

77
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:04,243
Aunt Rose.

78
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:09,207
Aunt Rose Comfort!

79
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,727
Why don't you answer?

80
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:13,940
I can't catch my breath
when it rings.

81
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:15,945
Answer it!

82
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:21,343
Hello?
This is Miss. Rose Comfort.

83
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:27,071
No, the lady of the house
is Mrs. Archie Lee Meighan...

84
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:30,285
They don't want to know that,
who is it and what do they want?

85
00:08:30,447 --> 00:08:33,649
I can't hear well, could you
speak a bit louder?

86
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:38,610
The Ideal Pay As You Go Plan?

87
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:40,055
Give me the phone.

88
00:08:42,224 --> 00:08:45,859
Now, what is this, boy?
Yes.

89
00:08:46,511 --> 00:08:50,145
Today? No, you've got to
give me a little more time.

90
00:08:50,837 --> 00:08:53,914
I've had a little set back
in business lately...

91
00:08:54,082 --> 00:08:57,603
The syndicate built their own
cotton gin, and I lost their trade.

92
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:01,850
It's going to take me a little
longer to recover from that...

93
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:07,980
Then take it out!
Take it out, out, out!

94
00:09:08,144 --> 00:09:10,981
You'll never get my business again,
never.

95
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,716
Honey, you ain't gonna lose
your fine furniture...?

96
00:09:21,884 --> 00:09:24,277
Will you shut up
and get back in the kitchen?

97
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:28,249
And don't you speak a word
of what you heard to my wife.

98
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:32,379
Don't holler anymore in this house,
and don't cackle...

99
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:38,023
or I'll pack you up and haul you off
to that home at Sunset.

100
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:41,745
Did you say something to me
Archie Lee?

101
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,955
Yes. I said shoot!

102
00:09:53,852 --> 00:09:55,651
What made her holler this time?

103
00:09:55,815 --> 00:09:58,538
How do I know what made her holler
this time...

104
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,693
or last time,
or the next time?

105
00:10:00,862 --> 00:10:04,143
The last time was because
you throwed something at her.

106
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:06,148
What did I ever throw
at Aunt Rose?

107
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:10,065
A glass of water, for singing
church hymns in the kitchen.

108
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,598
Water?

109
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:14,755
This much water.
I barely sprinkled her.

110
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:16,040
She don't hear nothing.

111
00:10:16,206 --> 00:10:17,561
I know.

112
00:10:17,848 --> 00:10:21,847
You've got to do something
to get the old woman's attention.

113
00:10:24,017 --> 00:10:26,011
Hey, hey, cut that out!
Archie!

114
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:31,583
Get your hands off me!
Get them off!

115
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:42,357
I'm moving to
the Kotton King Hotel...

116
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:47,527
the next time you try to break
our agreement, the very next time...

117
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:00,544
Baby Doll!

118
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,034
Baby Doll!

119
00:11:14,413 --> 00:11:16,725
Come down, if you're going
into town with me...

120
00:11:16,896 --> 00:11:19,573
I've got to be at the doctor's
ten minutes ago.

121
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:37,118
Baby Doll!

122
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:42,369
If you're so impatient,
go ahead without me.

123
00:11:42,574 --> 00:11:45,571
I've plenty of ways of
getting to town without you.

124
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,220
That's true.

125
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,308
You come on!

126
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,973
Get your cotton-picking tail
down here.

127
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:25,154
Take your time.

128
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:33,001
Morning, Sam.

129
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:40,412
What are you waiting for?

130
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:44,026
Come on, get into the car.

131
00:12:44,988 --> 00:12:47,425
I'll get into the back seat
of that skatterbolt...

132
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:51,192
when you get out, walk around,
and open the door like a gentleman.

133
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:55,594
You'll wait a long time
if that's what you're waiting for.

134
00:12:55,764 --> 00:12:59,445
I declare, my father
would turn over in his grave.

135
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,367
I never once saw your father
open a door for any woman...

136
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:06,328
especially not your
water-legged mother. Get in!

137
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:29,726
Sid, come here.

138
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:31,216
Why are we stopping here?

139
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,858
What are you doing here?

140
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:35,218
Vacarro's got me working
for him now.

141
00:13:35,383 --> 00:13:37,342
For him? You're working for him?

142
00:13:37,506 --> 00:13:40,388
What could I do? The syndicate
shut my gin down.

143
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:41,701
What's going on?

144
00:13:41,873 --> 00:13:43,992
A celebration of some kind...

145
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,275
Why shouldn't they celebrate?

146
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,197
It's got every last bit of business
in the county.

147
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:52,681
Every last bit of what
you and I used to get.

148
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,804
They've got an up-to-date gin,
not like your pile of junk.

149
00:13:58,177 --> 00:14:00,331
When are we getting out of here?

150
00:14:25,538 --> 00:14:28,420
Would you mind
moving your arm?

151
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:32,900
Happy anniversary.

152
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:45,200
She's sure grown up.

153
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:49,726
I'm as fond of Aunt Rose as you are,
but I'm in no position to feed and...

154
00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:53,290
Look here, the day Aunt Rose
is unwelcome under your roof...

155
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,941
her and me both
is moving out.

156
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,253
She can't cook...

157
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:59,579
If you don't like her cooking,
get me a regular servant...

158
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:02,950
don't think I'll cook for
a big fat old thing like you.

159
00:15:03,114 --> 00:15:03,911
Quit saying fat...

160
00:15:04,075 --> 00:15:06,468
Lose weight
and I'll quit saying it.

161
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,197
Right, but I'm serving you notice,
if that old woman dies in my house...

162
00:15:11,366 --> 00:15:15,730
I ain't gonna pay for her funeral.
I'll have her burned up. Cremated.

163
00:15:15,893 --> 00:15:18,252
I'll pack her ashes
in an old bottle...

164
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,650
and I'll pitch the bottle
into Tiger Tail Bayou.

165
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,258
Mr. Meighan,
you're late for your appointment.

166
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,267
The doctor will see you anyway,
I don't know why.

167
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:38,796
Hey.

168
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,367
Hi.

169
00:15:41,772 --> 00:15:42,889
Are you the dentist?

170
00:15:43,054 --> 00:15:45,048
Yes, ma'am, I'm the dentist.

171
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,374
I was scouting around for a job
and I noticed your sign...

172
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:52,378
and I thought I might
help you out.

173
00:15:56,554 --> 00:15:58,353
What are you doing?

174
00:15:58,517 --> 00:16:02,197
A boy in here a while ago
beat me playing checkers.

175
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,516
I still can't figure out why.

176
00:16:04,686 --> 00:16:08,571
Well, what do you do?
Can you type?

177
00:16:11,977 --> 00:16:15,292
No, I don't do no typing...

178
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,463
but I print a real good hand.

179
00:16:19,348 --> 00:16:22,311
I don't know whether
we can use that.

180
00:16:24,836 --> 00:16:27,639
You're awful young
to be a dentist.

181
00:16:28,762 --> 00:16:31,759
I'm just getting started.

182
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:36,126
What's the matter with you?

183
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:40,817
I haven't been myself, John.

184
00:16:40,981 --> 00:16:42,416
In what way?

185
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:52,507
Well, you're not an old man,
but you're not a young man either.

186
00:16:52,918 --> 00:16:54,991
That's the truth, it's no lie.

187
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:56,278
How long have you been married?

188
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:58,084
About a year.

189
00:17:01,531 --> 00:17:03,091
She's pretty.

190
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:05,174
Yeah, I guess so.

191
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:07,653
Youth.

192
00:17:10,504 --> 00:17:12,738
Been under some sort of a strain?

193
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,742
No, no strain at all.

194
00:17:15,552 --> 00:17:17,386
You look mighty nervous to me.

195
00:17:17,595 --> 00:17:19,236
I'm not nervous.

196
00:17:28,772 --> 00:17:33,569
You'd have to know typing.
It's typing.

197
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,418
Awfully nice talking to you.

198
00:17:36,584 --> 00:17:37,814
Yes, ma'am.

199
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:44,227
Mr. Meighan, come back in here.

200
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:46,787
The doctor's going to give you
a prescription.

201
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:52,726
Archie Lee, all I think you need
is a harmless sedative.

202
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:57,406
Take this down to old man Hogg,
and take it according to directions.

203
00:17:57,575 --> 00:18:00,252
Here you are.
Don't forget your sweater.

204
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:03,092
It won't help what's wrong
with you one bit.

205
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:09,872
How you doing, Archie?

206
00:18:10,034 --> 00:18:14,318
I've spent just about the whole day
sitting on Main Street.

207
00:18:19,127 --> 00:18:21,804
Why didn't you bring me
a double dip?

208
00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:23,934
How long are we gonna sit here?

209
00:18:24,095 --> 00:18:26,214
I've got to wait
for my prescription.

210
00:18:26,418 --> 00:18:28,332
What the hell's so funny?

211
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,510
Chinamen. People know
the situation between us.

212
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:42,279
Yesterday on Front St,
a man said to me...

213
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:45,119
"Has your wife
outgrowed her crib yet?"

214
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:50,523
Three or four others haw-hawed at me.
It was public humiliation.

215
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:54,731
Private humiliation
is just as painful.

216
00:18:56,543 --> 00:18:58,662
There's no torture to equal
the torture...

217
00:18:58,826 --> 00:19:01,264
which a cold woman
inflicts on a man.

218
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:02,777
There's no torture
to compare with it.

219
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:06,499
I've staked out a lot in hell,
with a rotten house on it...

220
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:09,550
and five sets of furniture
not paid for.

221
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:12,276
You've bit off more
than you can chew.

222
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,799
Archie Lee, is that our furniture?

223
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,285
No, no it isn't.

224
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:29,460
They're taking away our furniture,
go after them.

225
00:19:29,621 --> 00:19:31,455
I've got to wait
for my prescription.

226
00:19:31,624 --> 00:19:34,461
Prescription?
Mister, stop.

227
00:19:34,628 --> 00:19:36,144
Come here. Come here.

228
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:37,587
Stop, please.

229
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:40,636
Let's get home before
they get the rest of it.

230
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:43,480
Baby Doll!

231
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:47,479
You better go get her?

232
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:49,243
I guess I better.

233
00:19:51,614 --> 00:19:52,765
What would you do?

234
00:19:52,936 --> 00:19:54,577
Get tough with her.

235
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:56,460
Easy to say.
Come on.

236
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:06,828
Look out, here comes trouble.

237
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:12,517
- What about those people, boss?
- Just keep loading.

238
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:15,047
Get out of my chair,
out of my chair!

239
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,933
Stay off my furniture!

240
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,494
That's my rose lamp,
get off!

241
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,493
She better not hit me again.

242
00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:26,864
Put that down!

243
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,040
I thought I heard
something rattling.

244
00:20:50,142 --> 00:20:51,623
Leave me alone.

245
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:55,385
I don't want to be with a man who'd
make me live without furniture.

246
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,461
Honey...

247
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:59,628
My daddy would turn over
in his grave if he knew.

248
00:20:59,796 --> 00:21:03,876
Baby Doll, if your father turned
in his grave as often as you say...

249
00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:06,720
the old man would
fall off the graveyard.

250
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:12,772
Look at Aunt Rose, picking roses
as if nothing had happened.

251
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,209
I'm moving to
the Kotton King Hotel.

252
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:19,220
I'm moving to
the Kotton King Hotel.

253
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,540
I'm gonna get me a good job.

254
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:25,389
The hotel manager helped carry
my daddy's coffin, he'll give me one.

255
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:28,277
What sort of work
do you think you could do?

256
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,758
I could curl hair
at a beauty parlour.

257
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:34,283
Or I reckon I could be
a hostess...

258
00:21:34,448 --> 00:21:35,963
Second floor's all clear now.

259
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,691
Smile at people coming in a place.

260
00:21:37,853 --> 00:21:38,445
What place?

261
00:21:38,614 --> 00:21:41,816
Any place.
I could be a cashier.

262
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:43,893
You can't count.

263
00:21:44,062 --> 00:21:49,019
Well, I could pass out menus
or programmes or something.

264
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:51,226
Say hello to people.

265
00:21:51,914 --> 00:21:53,987
I can say hello.

266
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:56,514
Sign here.

267
00:22:00,768 --> 00:22:03,046
Kotton King?
This is Mrs. Meighan...

268
00:22:03,211 --> 00:22:05,934
I want to reserve a room
for tomorrow morning.

269
00:22:06,857 --> 00:22:08,895
I want to register
under my maiden name...

270
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:11,736
which is Baby Doll
Carson McCorkle.

271
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:14,257
My daddy was
T.C. Carson McCorkle...

272
00:22:14,427 --> 00:22:16,991
he died last summer,
when I got married...

273
00:22:17,151 --> 00:22:20,832
he was a very close personal friend
of the manager of the hotel.

274
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:25,557
What's his name?

275
00:22:31,012 --> 00:22:33,895
Archie Lee,
look at these flowers.

276
00:22:34,658 --> 00:22:36,936
Poems of nature.

277
00:22:50,764 --> 00:22:54,205
When are we going to gin out
some more cotton, Mr. Archie?

278
00:23:11,715 --> 00:23:13,150
Oh, my.

279
00:23:35,912 --> 00:23:38,828
That's the strongest brandy
I ever had.

280
00:23:38,996 --> 00:23:41,673
It must've come right out
of Tiger Tail brook.

281
00:23:42,562 --> 00:23:45,399
Young man, Mr. Vacarro...

282
00:23:45,566 --> 00:23:47,764
this is a mighty fine party
you're throwing tonight...

283
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:52,214
in honour of your first anniversary
as manager of the syndicate gin.

284
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:55,497
Just a minute there, sonny,
hold it.

285
00:23:56,742 --> 00:24:00,103
I've got something I ought
to get off my chest.

286
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,264
Us good neighbours appreciate...

287
00:24:03,432 --> 00:24:04,423
Just a second.

288
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:09,074
Gentlemen, there'll be
a fish fry Saturday night.

289
00:24:09,642 --> 00:24:12,113
Catfish, hush puppies,
dancing...

290
00:24:12,806 --> 00:24:14,288
bring your ladies.

291
00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:17,692
You go right on.

292
00:24:17,854 --> 00:24:21,374
I want you to know us neighbours
appreciate your achievement...

293
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,343
in bringing in the biggest
cotton crop ever picked...

294
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,306
on this blessed soil
of Tiger Tail County.

295
00:24:27,469 --> 00:24:29,940
Senator, my old dad once said...

296
00:24:30,113 --> 00:24:33,667
"Blessed is he who has nothing to say
and cannot be persuaded to say it".

297
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,913
A couple of boys
don't look too happy.

298
00:24:36,082 --> 00:24:38,315
They've no reason to be.
You put them out of business.

299
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:43,281
- They've got plenty of good liquor.
- I'll drink my own.

300
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,492
When you first came here...

301
00:24:50,863 --> 00:24:53,905
I'll admit us old-timers
we a bit standoffish.

302
00:24:54,308 --> 00:24:56,906
We didn't know you all that well.

303
00:24:57,353 --> 00:25:01,796
Naturally, what's profitable to some
is unprofitable to others.

304
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,915
As the fella says, one man's meat
is another man's poison.

305
00:25:07,087 --> 00:25:10,368
We all know some folks here
have suffered financially...

306
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:14,578
due in some way to this man's success
with his syndicate plantation...

307
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,620
but as a whole, the community
stands to reap a nice fat profit.

308
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:21,987
Senator, next time,
run on a Republican ticket...

309
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,189
we'll get the nigger vote
out for you.

310
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:32,038
Silva! Silva!

311
00:25:38,695 --> 00:25:40,894
Mr Silva!

312
00:25:52,515 --> 00:25:54,794
Move the wagons!
Move them!

313
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,918
Get that cotton moving!

314
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:05,733
Get the cotton moving!
Get those wagons out!

315
00:26:05,895 --> 00:26:08,812
Mr Silva, where are you?

316
00:26:36,101 --> 00:26:37,695
They're trying to kill me.

317
00:26:38,023 --> 00:26:39,698
I found this...

318
00:26:43,952 --> 00:26:45,627
kerosene can.

319
00:27:07,588 --> 00:27:10,983
Marshal, what are you going to do
to find the men that burned my gin?

320
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:13,991
What makes you sure your gin
was set fire to?

321
00:27:14,158 --> 00:27:18,681
Look around you. You ever seen
so many happy faces?

322
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:23,166
It's like a rich man's funeral
with all his relations attending.

323
00:27:23,332 --> 00:27:25,052
I'd hate to have to prove that.

324
00:27:25,215 --> 00:27:27,493
I'd hate to have to depend on you
to prove it.

325
00:27:30,142 --> 00:27:33,218
I can't honestly imagine, if it's
a case of arson, who done it.

326
00:27:33,386 --> 00:27:37,146
Every man you put out of business was
in that gin when the fire broke out.

327
00:27:37,312 --> 00:27:39,385
One wasn't,
I know of one that wasn't.

328
00:27:39,555 --> 00:27:42,312
Naming names just on suspicion
is a risky business.

329
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,559
I didn't name a name. But whoever
did it forgot to take this with him.

330
00:27:46,726 --> 00:27:48,640
Marshal, he's your deputy.

331
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:51,647
I'll take this can
and examine it very carefully.

332
00:27:51,814 --> 00:27:55,289
See if there's a basis for thinking
it was used for starting a fire.

333
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,901
I ran through fire to get this,
I mean to keep it.

334
00:27:59,065 --> 00:28:01,902
Lock it in the pick-up truck.

335
00:28:13,607 --> 00:28:16,250
Ginnie, sing us a song.

336
00:28:18,254 --> 00:28:23,016
I shall not,
I shall not be moved.

337
00:28:24,023 --> 00:28:29,023
I shall not,
I shall not be moved...

338
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:34,311
like a tree that's planted
by the water...

339
00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:39,354
I shall not be moved.

340
00:28:39,725 --> 00:28:42,528
How are you going to gin out
the rest of your cotton?

341
00:28:43,371 --> 00:28:45,649
I'll truck it over to Sunset.

342
00:28:46,415 --> 00:28:48,694
Collins will gin it out for me.

343
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,381
Collins has got his own cotton
to gin.

344
00:28:51,543 --> 00:28:53,902
Well, I'll truck it over
to Bolivar county.

345
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:56,460
No one around here's
gonna gin it out for me.

346
00:28:56,871 --> 00:29:00,552
I shall not be moved.

347
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,676
Silva!

348
00:29:11,453 --> 00:29:12,570
Get off...

349
00:29:12,735 --> 00:29:14,410
It's me.

350
00:29:14,898 --> 00:29:16,049
They got the can, boss.

351
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:16,812
Who?

352
00:29:16,982 --> 00:29:20,057
Somebody jumped me
from the rear.

353
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,343
Stay back, stay back.

354
00:29:28,718 --> 00:29:31,442
Boy, take the advice
of an old-timer...

355
00:29:31,763 --> 00:29:34,406
who was born and raised
in this county...

356
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:38,202
and knows every nigger,
every hound dog...

357
00:29:38,373 --> 00:29:41,130
every toadstool and every tree stump
in 50 miles around.

358
00:29:41,418 --> 00:29:44,573
My advice is not to make
any more reckless charges.

359
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:47,545
Being a foreigner, you already
got strike one and two...

360
00:29:47,707 --> 00:29:51,148
I want no advice, no law
and no court in this county.

361
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:55,228
I'm from an old country where
it's tradition for each man...

362
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:57,358
to make his own justice...

363
00:29:57,522 --> 00:30:01,076
like bootleg liquor,
private, in secret.

364
00:30:01,528 --> 00:30:04,000
Because there was corruption
there too...

365
00:30:04,172 --> 00:30:08,457
and justice was executed by
each man himself, alone.

366
00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:12,061
I mean Biblical justice.

367
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,866
Eye for eye,
tooth for tooth.

368
00:30:15,668 --> 00:30:17,150
Let's go.

369
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,739
I've got to know who did this.

370
00:30:39,545 --> 00:30:41,139
I think I know.

371
00:30:48,037 --> 00:30:50,191
Which one did it?
You know.

372
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:53,439
They were all in the shed
except one...

373
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:56,079
the one who wasn't,
I figure did it.

374
00:30:59,655 --> 00:31:02,571
He's the one who's
going to gin out my cotton.

375
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,337
Get her up.

376
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,359
Furniture's coming back today.

377
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:41,640
Have mercy...

378
00:31:41,805 --> 00:31:43,480
Go on, get.

379
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:54,943
Don't say a word, a little bird
already told me...

380
00:31:55,105 --> 00:31:57,669
you'd bring wagons full of cotton
straight to my door.

381
00:31:57,829 --> 00:32:00,347
I want you to know
you're a very lucky fella.

382
00:32:00,513 --> 00:32:01,025
How come?

383
00:32:01,193 --> 00:32:05,112
I'm in a position to hold back the
other orders and give you priority.

384
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,398
Come on, get out of that truck
and have some coffee.

385
00:32:08,565 --> 00:32:09,476
What's the price?

386
00:32:09,646 --> 00:32:11,560
You remember, it hasn't changed.

387
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:12,925
How about your equipment?

388
00:32:13,091 --> 00:32:15,734
A1 shape, always was.
You ought to remember that.

389
00:32:15,896 --> 00:32:18,208
You needed a new saw cylinder.
You got one?

390
00:32:18,379 --> 00:32:21,501
I can't find one on the market
to equal the old one yet.

391
00:32:21,664 --> 00:32:24,979
Come on, have some coffee.
We're ready for you.

392
00:32:26,351 --> 00:32:29,747
When you saw my gin burn down
last night you must've figured...

393
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:33,232
you might get a good deal of business
your way in the morning.

394
00:32:33,402 --> 00:32:35,157
You want to know something?

395
00:32:35,966 --> 00:32:38,484
I'm always glad to know something
when there's something to know.

396
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,686
I never did see that fire of yours.
No, sir.

397
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:46,772
No, sir. Come on. Come on
in my house and have some coffee.

398
00:32:46,943 --> 00:32:50,497
You, you come too.
Come on, come on.

399
00:32:50,788 --> 00:32:53,546
No, I never did see that fire.

400
00:32:53,713 --> 00:32:58,270
We hit the sack after supper and I
didn't know till this morning.

401
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:01,322
Baby Doll, come out here.
Come here, Baby Doll.

402
00:33:01,684 --> 00:33:04,920
I want you to meet Mr. Vacarro,
from the syndicate plantation.

403
00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:06,771
Say, what's your first name?

404
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:08,643
How do you spell it?

405
00:33:08,523 --> 00:33:10,562
S, I, L, V, A.

406
00:33:10,726 --> 00:33:12,924
Sure enough?
Like a "silva" lining?

407
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:16,012
Every cloud has got
a silver lining!

408
00:33:16,174 --> 00:33:18,168
What's that from, the Bible?

409
00:33:18,612 --> 00:33:20,207
No, the mother goose book.

410
00:33:22,578 --> 00:33:24,697
That name sounds foreign.

411
00:33:25,302 --> 00:33:26,784
It is, Mrs. Meighan...

412
00:33:27,065 --> 00:33:30,107
I'm known as the wop that runs
the syndicate plantation.

413
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:33,466
Don't call yourself names,
let the others do that.

414
00:33:33,835 --> 00:33:37,196
You sure are a lucky fella, Silva,
gold or nickel plated...

415
00:33:37,361 --> 00:33:40,961
you're lucky I could take
a job on of your size now.

416
00:33:41,126 --> 00:33:44,441
You're my neighbour and I believe
in the good neighbour policy.

417
00:33:44,612 --> 00:33:47,653
You do me a good turn,
and I'll do you a good turn.

418
00:33:47,816 --> 00:33:52,134
Tit for tat and tat for tit
is the policy we live on.

419
00:33:52,422 --> 00:33:54,381
Aunt Rose Comfort...

420
00:33:54,626 --> 00:33:56,380
Baby Doll...

421
00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:00,430
Get your daddy's old maid sister
to bring coffee for Mr. Vacarro.

422
00:34:00,595 --> 00:34:02,076
Get her yourself?

423
00:34:02,237 --> 00:34:03,433
Honey...

424
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:06,443
Honey, honey, honey.

425
00:34:07,205 --> 00:34:09,848
I want you to entertain
these gentlemen.

426
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:13,133
Look, look at her blush.
Look.

427
00:34:13,975 --> 00:34:16,698
Look at her blush.
This is my Baby...

428
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:19,901
My little girl, every precious
ounce of her is mine.

429
00:34:22,267 --> 00:34:23,543
Aunt Rose!

430
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:25,585
Aunt Rose Comfort!

431
00:34:31,922 --> 00:34:35,637
Excuse my yawn, we was up
awful late last night.

432
00:34:41,176 --> 00:34:42,770
So, you're a wop?

433
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:46,821
I'm a Sicilian, Mrs. Meighan,
a very ancient people.

434
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,661
Sicilian...

435
00:34:52,192 --> 00:34:53,991
I'm from Corpus Christi.

436
00:34:54,756 --> 00:34:56,271
How unusual.

437
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,955
Honey, at noon, I want you
to take Mr. Vacarro...

438
00:35:00,124 --> 00:35:03,519
to the Kotton King for a chicken
dinner. Sign my name...

439
00:35:04,891 --> 00:35:06,885
When bad luck hits you...

440
00:35:07,054 --> 00:35:09,208
you find out who your friends are.
I mean to prove it.

441
00:35:09,698 --> 00:35:13,139
Baby Doll, I want you to entertain
this gentleman in the house...

442
00:35:13,304 --> 00:35:16,141
it's the good neighbour policy,
tit for tat and tat for tit.

443
00:35:16,308 --> 00:35:19,510
You do me a good turn
and I'll do you a good turn.

444
00:35:19,673 --> 00:35:22,556
That's right, come on, honey.

445
00:35:22,718 --> 00:35:25,156
Now, make those wagons move now,
get them rolling.

446
00:35:26,644 --> 00:35:29,082
I can't make nobody comfortable
in that house...

447
00:35:29,248 --> 00:35:31,686
you're lucky if you can find
a chair to sit down on.

448
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,536
You want coffee?

449
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:38,980
No, just a cool drink of water,
thank you, ma'am.

450
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:43,117
The house water runs warm...

451
00:35:43,285 --> 00:35:45,883
but if you've the energy to work
that old pump...

452
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,730
you can get a nice cool drink
from that cistern.

453
00:35:50,697 --> 00:35:53,261
I've got energy to burn.

454
00:36:08,964 --> 00:36:13,727
They dump their garbage in the yard.
Ignorance, indulgence and stink.

455
00:36:13,892 --> 00:36:16,125
Well Mrs. Meighan
smelled pretty good.

456
00:36:16,295 --> 00:36:18,733
You keep your nose
in the cotton.

457
00:36:18,899 --> 00:36:21,782
Sometimes, water comes,
sometimes it don't.

458
00:36:21,944 --> 00:36:23,938
This time it will.

459
00:36:27,793 --> 00:36:31,153
Bring me a drink of that nice
cool well water, please.

460
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,397
"So, you're a wop?"

461
00:36:38,808 --> 00:36:43,685
I don't have the strength anymore
to draw water out of that well.

462
00:36:44,217 --> 00:36:45,857
Would you like a cool drink
of water?

463
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:49,016
How do you do?
I'm Aunt Rose Comfort.

464
00:36:49,344 --> 00:36:53,503
My brother was Baby Doll's daddy,
Mr. T.C. Carson McCorkle.

465
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:57,269
I've been visiting here since...

466
00:36:58,438 --> 00:37:01,993
I can't remember
just when it was.

467
00:37:02,164 --> 00:37:06,322
I hope you don't mind
drinking out of a gourd.

468
00:37:11,378 --> 00:37:16,334
Excuse me please, that old hen
has got back in my kitchen.

469
00:37:18,629 --> 00:37:20,668
I could think of worse ways
to spend an afternoon...

470
00:37:20,832 --> 00:37:23,874
than drinking cool well water
with Mrs. Meighan.

471
00:37:31,006 --> 00:37:34,321
Stay with the cotton.
Go on, stay with the cotton.

472
00:37:40,861 --> 00:37:43,015
There's such a difference
in water...

473
00:37:43,185 --> 00:37:46,262
you wouldn't think so,
but there certainly is.

474
00:37:47,712 --> 00:37:51,073
I take it you've not had
this place long, Mrs. Meighan?

475
00:37:51,237 --> 00:37:53,596
No. We've had it long.

476
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:59,442
Don't you have garbage collectors
on Tiger Tail road?

477
00:38:00,331 --> 00:38:03,931
Oh, it costs extra for them
to come out here...

478
00:38:04,097 --> 00:38:05,737
and Archie Lee...

479
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,256
I don't know,
I almost give up sometimes.

480
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:16,827
You say you've got a bunch of
unfurnished rooms in this house?

481
00:38:17,357 --> 00:38:19,110
Five complete sets of furniture...

482
00:38:19,279 --> 00:38:23,244
hauled away by the Ideal Pay
As You Go Plan Furniture Company.

483
00:38:24,486 --> 00:38:28,007
When did this misfortune
fall upon you?

484
00:38:28,653 --> 00:38:32,412
Yesterday. Ain't that awful?
Yesterday.

485
00:38:32,939 --> 00:38:35,936
Both of us had misfortunes
on the same day...

486
00:38:36,665 --> 00:38:39,308
You lost your furniture,
my cotton gin burned down.

487
00:38:39,469 --> 00:38:40,745
Yes...

488
00:38:41,272 --> 00:38:42,262
Quite a coincidence!

489
00:38:42,434 --> 00:38:43,663
What's that?

490
00:38:43,996 --> 00:38:46,594
I said it was a coincidence
of misfortune.

491
00:38:47,481 --> 00:38:51,925
Sure. What can you do with
a bunch of unfurnished rooms?

492
00:38:55,293 --> 00:38:58,654
Well, you could play
hide and seek.

493
00:38:59,259 --> 00:39:01,332
Not me, I'm not athletic.

494
00:39:02,544 --> 00:39:07,466
When I arrived in this county to
take over the syndicate plantation...

495
00:39:08,553 --> 00:39:11,310
this house was empty, I was told
it was haunted.

496
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:15,237
Yes, that's why Archie Lee
got it for almost nothing.

497
00:39:16,244 --> 00:39:18,967
Sometimes I don't know where
to go or what to do.

498
00:39:19,248 --> 00:39:23,247
That's not uncommon, people enter
this world without instructions.

499
00:39:23,935 --> 00:39:25,256
I said...

500
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:29,546
Is that your breakfast?

501
00:39:29,831 --> 00:39:32,508
I said, people come into this world
without instructions...

502
00:39:32,675 --> 00:39:34,748
where to go or what to do.

503
00:39:34,918 --> 00:39:37,801
They wander a little
and then go away.

504
00:39:38,484 --> 00:39:40,955
Drift for a while
and then vanish...

505
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:44,002
they make room
for newcomers.

506
00:39:45,374 --> 00:39:48,416
Old goes, new comes.

507
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,895
Going and coming, back and forth.
Rush, rush.

508
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:57,429
Permanent, nothing.

509
00:39:59,596 --> 00:40:01,031
Anything living...

510
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,002
that lasts long enough
to take it serious...

511
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:07,796
What's this?

512
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:10,964
It's that old car
belonging to Mrs. Dobarn...

513
00:40:11,132 --> 00:40:13,889
the lady that used to own this house
and haunts it now.

514
00:40:14,818 --> 00:40:16,572
Where to, madam?

515
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:18,501
We're gonna play chauffeur.

516
00:40:25,594 --> 00:40:29,274
Drive me along the river with all
the windows open to cool me off.

517
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:31,562
The chauffeur sits in the front.

518
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:33,842
That seat's got no cushion.

519
00:40:34,968 --> 00:40:37,850
Come on! Get on your feet,
let's go!

520
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:45,698
Look out, get on your feet,
let's get in there.

521
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:48,466
Let's cut some cotton.

522
00:40:51,954 --> 00:40:54,597
It's hard to find a place to sit
since the Ideal Furniture Company...

523
00:40:54,758 --> 00:40:56,911
lost patience,
to sit in comfort.

524
00:40:57,082 --> 00:41:01,684
It's hard to sit in comfort when the
Ideal people lost their patience...

525
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:05,333
and your gin burns down.

526
00:41:12,864 --> 00:41:13,855
Would you move your leg?

527
00:41:14,026 --> 00:41:15,906
But it's cool in here.

528
00:41:16,189 --> 00:41:20,029
Comfortable to sit in.
What's this here?

529
00:41:20,596 --> 00:41:24,231
It's my charm bracelet.
My daddy gave it to me.

530
00:41:25,564 --> 00:41:27,443
They're the Ten Commandments.

531
00:41:27,887 --> 00:41:29,038
And these here?

532
00:41:29,209 --> 00:41:30,530
My birthday.

533
00:41:32,053 --> 00:41:34,252
How many charming birthdays
have you had?

534
00:41:35,499 --> 00:41:38,063
As many as the charms
on the bracelet.

535
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:39,656
Do you mind?

536
00:41:39,825 --> 00:41:41,021
Count them.

537
00:41:53,406 --> 00:41:54,601
That's all.

538
00:41:55,648 --> 00:41:57,209
I'll be 20 tomorrow.

539
00:41:57,691 --> 00:42:01,167
Tomorrow is election day
and my birthday...

540
00:42:01,938 --> 00:42:05,697
and the day that Franklin Roosevelt
was elected for the first time.

541
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:09,621
It's a great day for the country
for both reasons.

542
00:42:10,871 --> 00:42:13,548
He was a man to respect.

543
00:42:14,871 --> 00:42:17,104
And you're a lady to respect.

544
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:19,671
Me?

545
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,159
I never got past the fourth grade.

546
00:42:23,764 --> 00:42:25,200
Why did you quit?

547
00:42:25,727 --> 00:42:29,282
Well, I had a great deal of trouble
with long division.

548
00:42:31,496 --> 00:42:35,781
The teacher would send me up to the
blackboard to work on a problem...

549
00:42:36,944 --> 00:42:40,659
and I would go up to the blackboard,
lean my head against it...

550
00:42:41,872 --> 00:42:44,595
and cry and cry.

551
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,278
Would you move your leg?

552
00:42:51,325 --> 00:42:53,523
You want me to move my leg?

553
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:56,602
Otherwise, I can't get out.

554
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:58,926
OK.

555
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:01,815
Well...

556
00:43:02,983 --> 00:43:05,740
I'd just cry and cry and cry.

557
00:43:07,069 --> 00:43:09,985
Well, finally I left school...

558
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:13,788
and a girl without education,
a girl without...

559
00:43:16,003 --> 00:43:17,358
Mr. Vacarro?

560
00:43:18,967 --> 00:43:21,245
Just picking up a few
pecan nuts.

561
00:43:23,173 --> 00:43:25,327
Excuse me...

562
00:43:25,777 --> 00:43:27,532
Excuse me, Mr. Vacarro...

563
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,175
but I wouldn't dream of eating a nut
a man had cracked in his mouth.

564
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:34,100
You've got many refinements.

565
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:36,542
Thank you.

566
00:43:37,876 --> 00:43:42,718
I don't think you need worry about
your failure at long division.

567
00:43:43,483 --> 00:43:46,047
After all, you got through
short division...

568
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:49,967
short division is all a lady ought
to be called on to cope with.

569
00:43:51,856 --> 00:43:53,086
Well...

570
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:55,459
I ought to be going in now.

571
00:44:03,113 --> 00:44:06,394
I get so depressed going through
all them empty rooms.

572
00:44:06,798 --> 00:44:08,393
Are all the rooms empty?

573
00:44:08,721 --> 00:44:12,606
Except the nursery and kitchen.
The stuff there is paid for.

574
00:44:13,008 --> 00:44:14,728
Do you have a child
in the nursery?

575
00:44:15,451 --> 00:44:17,410
Me? No.

576
00:44:18,456 --> 00:44:20,290
I sleep in the nursery myself.

577
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:23,584
I let the slats down
on the crib.

578
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,057
Why do you sleep
in the nursery?

579
00:44:27,379 --> 00:44:31,013
Mr. Vacarro, that's
a personal question.

580
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:39,867
Well, I ought to be
going in now.

581
00:44:50,693 --> 00:44:54,134
There are rooms in that house
I've never been in...

582
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:57,298
like, for instance, the attic.

583
00:44:57,984 --> 00:45:02,142
Most of the time I'm scared
to go in that house by myself.

584
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:04,663
Just take last night,
when the fire broke out...

585
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:08,515
I sat here for hours waiting
for Archie Lee to come home...

586
00:45:08,841 --> 00:45:11,278
I was scared of going in
the house by myself.

587
00:45:11,445 --> 00:45:15,524
It must have been scary, without
your husband to look out for you.

588
00:45:15,691 --> 00:45:20,533
I'm telling you. The fire broke out
and lit up the whole sky...

589
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:22,977
with crazy shadows.

590
00:45:23,222 --> 00:45:25,501
And we didn't have a Coke
in the house.

591
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:27,387
I was mad at Archie Lee.

592
00:45:27,549 --> 00:45:29,622
You were mad, why?

593
00:45:29,792 --> 00:45:32,549
He went off and left me
without a Coke in the house.

594
00:45:32,716 --> 00:45:34,390
He left you without a Coke?

595
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:36,153
Yes, he did.

596
00:45:36,321 --> 00:45:40,640
And he didn't get back until
way after the fire had broken out.

597
00:45:40,968 --> 00:45:45,925
I got smoke in my eyes,
in my nose, in my throat...

598
00:45:47,939 --> 00:45:51,698
I was in such a worn out
nervous condition, I cried.

599
00:45:52,025 --> 00:45:56,344
Finally, I took two teaspoons
of paregoric.

600
00:45:56,512 --> 00:45:59,235
Sounds like you passed
a very uncomfortable night.

601
00:46:00,718 --> 00:46:02,359
Sounds like?

602
00:46:02,921 --> 00:46:04,676
It was.

603
00:46:06,407 --> 00:46:09,164
So Mr. Meighan disappeared
after supper.

604
00:46:11,695 --> 00:46:14,897
You say Mr. Meighan left the house
for a while after supper?

605
00:46:16,542 --> 00:46:18,536
Yes, for a moment.

606
00:46:18,986 --> 00:46:20,341
Just a moment?

607
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:23,908
How long a moment?

608
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,428
What are you driving at?

609
00:46:25,595 --> 00:46:27,110
Driving at?

610
00:46:27,357 --> 00:46:29,716
You're looking at me so funny.

611
00:46:29,961 --> 00:46:33,596
How long a moment did he
disappear for, can you remember?

612
00:46:33,767 --> 00:46:36,650
What difference does it make?
It doesn't matter...

613
00:46:36,812 --> 00:46:38,532
Why should you mind my asking?

614
00:46:39,376 --> 00:46:41,130
You make it sound like
I'm on trial.

615
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:43,692
Don't you like to pretend
like you're a witness?

616
00:46:45,946 --> 00:46:47,267
Witness of what?

617
00:46:47,428 --> 00:46:50,310
Say, for instance,
a case of arson.

618
00:46:52,716 --> 00:46:53,706
Arson?

619
00:46:54,158 --> 00:46:56,756
The wilful destruction
of property by fire.

620
00:46:57,643 --> 00:46:59,159
What?

621
00:46:59,406 --> 00:47:03,087
About my husband leaving after
supper, I can explain that.

622
00:47:03,252 --> 00:47:04,049
Can you?

623
00:47:04,213 --> 00:47:04,771
Sure.

624
00:47:04,934 --> 00:47:07,293
Good, how can you explain it?

625
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:13,335
What's the matter?
Can't you collect your thoughts?

626
00:47:15,779 --> 00:47:19,093
Your mind's a blank
on the subject?

627
00:47:20,465 --> 00:47:25,023
Do you find it impossible to remember
just why your husband disappeared?

628
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:30,513
You can't imagine what kind
of errand he went on, can you?

629
00:47:30,961 --> 00:47:34,516
But, when he returned...

630
00:47:34,687 --> 00:47:38,082
the fire had just broken out
at the syndicate plantation.

631
00:47:40,255 --> 00:47:42,978
I can't imagine what you could
possible be driving at.

632
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,982
No? You're a very unsatisfactory
witness, Mrs. Meighan.

633
00:47:51,392 --> 00:47:53,113
Should we drop the subject?

634
00:47:54,316 --> 00:47:55,512
I sure wish you would.

635
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:56,954
Well, sure.

636
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:02,839
It's no use crying over
a burnt down gin.

637
00:48:05,574 --> 00:48:07,647
Besides,
like your husband said...

638
00:48:08,818 --> 00:48:12,499
this world is built on the principle
of tit for tat.

639
00:48:14,586 --> 00:48:15,907
What do you mean?

640
00:48:19,994 --> 00:48:21,476
Nothing specific.

641
00:48:25,362 --> 00:48:26,160
Do you mind if I...?

642
00:48:26,324 --> 00:48:27,441
What?

643
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:29,282
Sit down.

644
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:31,531
Is it strong enough
to support us both?

645
00:48:31,692 --> 00:48:32,809
I hope.

646
00:48:34,697 --> 00:48:36,610
Let's swing a little.

647
00:48:37,621 --> 00:48:39,215
You seem all tense.

648
00:48:40,906 --> 00:48:43,104
Motion relaxes people.

649
00:48:44,071 --> 00:48:45,711
It's like a cradle.

650
00:48:46,154 --> 00:48:48,466
A cradle relaxes a baby.

651
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,962
They call you Baby, don't they?

652
00:48:52,123 --> 00:48:53,558
That's sort of a nickname.

653
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:56,967
Well, in a swing you can relax
just like in a cradle.

654
00:48:57,211 --> 00:49:01,529
I don't like to swing. Besides,
I'm relaxed as much as necessary...

655
00:49:01,697 --> 00:49:04,899
No, you're not.
Your nerves are all tied up.

656
00:49:05,864 --> 00:49:06,774
You make me nervous.

657
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:07,742
For swinging?

658
00:49:07,906 --> 00:49:08,976
Not just that.

659
00:49:09,148 --> 00:49:10,184
What else, then?

660
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:12,423
All those questions
about the fire.

661
00:49:14,396 --> 00:49:17,073
I was only enquiring
about your husband...

662
00:49:18,201 --> 00:49:20,673
about his leaving the house
after supper.

663
00:49:20,845 --> 00:49:23,808
There's no reason why I should
have to explain things to you.

664
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,334
No. Should we just relax.

665
00:49:34,506 --> 00:49:36,021
Would you move over and
make a little room?

666
00:49:39,634 --> 00:49:41,228
Is that enough room for you?

667
00:49:41,397 --> 00:49:43,470
It is for me, how about you?

668
00:49:46,885 --> 00:49:49,243
It was a lovely remark
your husband made...

669
00:49:50,691 --> 00:49:52,844
the good neighbour policy,
I mean.

670
00:49:54,737 --> 00:49:58,132
"You do me a good turn
and I'll do you one. "

671
00:50:00,544 --> 00:50:02,105
That was the way he put it.

672
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,830
There now.

673
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:13,315
Thanks.

674
00:50:13,484 --> 00:50:16,765
There's a lot of fine cotton lint
floating in the air.

675
00:50:16,929 --> 00:50:19,163
I know. It bothers my sinus.

676
00:50:19,974 --> 00:50:22,776
You're a very delicate woman,
Mrs. Meighan.

677
00:50:24,461 --> 00:50:26,455
Delicate, me?

678
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:31,173
There isn't much of you,
but what there is, is choice...

679
00:50:32,742 --> 00:50:34,575
delectable, I might say.

680
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:38,747
You're fine fibred...

681
00:50:40,033 --> 00:50:41,673
soft...

682
00:50:42,276 --> 00:50:43,597
smooth...

683
00:50:46,162 --> 00:50:49,877
This conversation really is
taking a personal turn.

684
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:53,044
You make me think of cotton.
No...

685
00:50:54,574 --> 00:50:57,536
No fabric or cloth...

686
00:50:57,698 --> 00:51:00,422
not even satin or silk...

687
00:51:01,985 --> 00:51:05,460
no kind of fibre,
not even a cotton fibre...

688
00:51:07,153 --> 00:51:10,194
has the absolute delicacy
of your skin.

689
00:51:10,838 --> 00:51:13,072
Should I say thanks, or something?

690
00:51:13,883 --> 00:51:18,441
Just smile.
You've got an attractive smile...

691
00:51:20,092 --> 00:51:22,769
And dimples...
Oh, yes, you do.

692
00:51:23,578 --> 00:51:25,093
Smile, Mrs. Meighan.

693
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,698
There, you see, you do have them.

694
00:51:28,545 --> 00:51:31,940
Please, don't touch me,
I don't like to be touched.

695
00:51:32,231 --> 00:51:33,985
Why do you giggle?

696
00:51:34,154 --> 00:51:37,116
You make me feel kind of hysterical.

697
00:51:37,759 --> 00:51:38,910
I do?

698
00:51:39,081 --> 00:51:40,311
Mr. Vacarro...

699
00:51:40,483 --> 00:51:41,679
Yes?

700
00:51:44,289 --> 00:51:46,761
I think I'll go and make us
some lemonade.

701
00:51:49,055 --> 00:51:50,730
What did you do that for?

702
00:51:51,659 --> 00:51:54,861
I don't want to be deprived
of the pleasure of your company.

703
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,062
Not yet.

704
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:01,947
Mr. Vacarro, you certainly are
getting familiar.

705
00:52:02,601 --> 00:52:04,800
Don't you have a little
fun loving spirit?

706
00:52:04,965 --> 00:52:06,686
This isn't fun.

707
00:52:06,888 --> 00:52:09,281
Why do you giggle, then?

708
00:52:09,492 --> 00:52:10,927
Because I'm ticklish.

709
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:12,576
Ticklish?

710
00:52:13,939 --> 00:52:15,420
Don't be so skittish.

711
00:52:17,264 --> 00:52:19,178
All right, I'll get up then.

712
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,788
Go on...

713
00:52:33,729 --> 00:52:35,642
I feel so weak.

714
00:52:48,149 --> 00:52:50,792
My head is fuzzy.

715
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:53,987
Fuzzy?

716
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,882
Fuzzy and buzzy...

717
00:53:05,696 --> 00:53:07,735
My head is swinging round.

718
00:53:13,307 --> 00:53:15,620
It must've been that swinging
that done it.

719
00:53:39,065 --> 00:53:40,216
Is there something on my arm?

720
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:41,903
No.

721
00:53:42,911 --> 00:53:44,632
Cut it out, it feels funny.

722
00:53:44,794 --> 00:53:46,070
How does it feel?

723
00:53:46,757 --> 00:53:50,072
Feels funny all up and down.
Quit switching me.

724
00:53:50,242 --> 00:53:52,156
I'm just shooing the flies off.

725
00:53:52,486 --> 00:53:53,841
They don't hurt nothing.

726
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:56,768
Cut it out, or I'm gonna call.

727
00:53:56,932 --> 00:53:58,368
Call who?

728
00:54:00,137 --> 00:54:01,094
The boy on the road.

729
00:54:01,259 --> 00:54:02,694
Go on, call then.

730
00:54:04,103 --> 00:54:05,094
Boy...

731
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:10,509
Can't you call any louder?

732
00:54:10,673 --> 00:54:12,348
Can't you call any louder?

733
00:54:12,516 --> 00:54:16,310
I feel so funny.
What's the matter with me?

734
00:54:16,482 --> 00:54:20,002
Just relax.
Give in, stop fighting it.

735
00:54:20,288 --> 00:54:23,968
I'm not. I'm not fighting.
It's you.

736
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:26,210
and you're suspicions...

737
00:54:26,537 --> 00:54:28,451
about my husband.

738
00:54:28,821 --> 00:54:30,653
Suspicions? Such as?

739
00:54:31,864 --> 00:54:33,346
That he burned down your gin.

740
00:54:33,507 --> 00:54:34,338
Well?

741
00:54:34,382 --> 00:54:35,612
He didn't.

742
00:54:35,659 --> 00:54:36,776
Didn't he?

743
00:54:36,816 --> 00:54:38,092
No, he didn't.

744
00:54:38,172 --> 00:54:39,732
He didn't.

745
00:54:42,463 --> 00:54:44,377
I'm going in the house now.

746
00:54:45,508 --> 00:54:47,786
Do you believe in ghosts,
Mrs. Meighan?

747
00:54:48,312 --> 00:54:52,311
I do. I believe in the presence
of evil spirits.

748
00:54:52,879 --> 00:54:54,873
What evil spirits
are you talking about?

749
00:54:55,122 --> 00:54:58,039
The spirits of violence
and cunning...

750
00:54:59,008 --> 00:55:02,050
malevolence, cruelty,
treachery...

751
00:55:02,934 --> 00:55:04,335
destruction.

752
00:55:04,496 --> 00:55:05,931
Them's just human characteristics.

753
00:55:07,381 --> 00:55:11,585
Evil spirits that haunt the human
heart and take possession of it.

754
00:55:12,268 --> 00:55:16,233
They spread from one human heart
to another...

755
00:55:16,394 --> 00:55:19,357
the way a fire goes springing
from leaf to leaf...

756
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:21,717
branch to branch
in a tree...

757
00:55:21,883 --> 00:55:23,922
till the forest is
all aflame with it.

758
00:55:24,085 --> 00:55:26,044
You've just got fire on the brain.

759
00:55:26,288 --> 00:55:28,681
I see more than there seems to be
on the surface.

760
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:32,728
I saw last night was an explosion
of those evil spirits.

761
00:55:33,259 --> 00:55:37,338
I fought it, I ran into it,
beating it, stamping it...

762
00:55:37,585 --> 00:55:39,385
shouting a curse of God at it.

763
00:55:40,109 --> 00:55:42,103
They dragged me out, suffocating.

764
00:55:42,433 --> 00:55:44,073
I was defeated.

765
00:55:44,596 --> 00:55:46,829
When I came to,
lying on the ground...

766
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,920
the fire had won the battle.

767
00:55:49,323 --> 00:55:51,362
All around was a ring
of human faces.

768
00:55:52,448 --> 00:55:55,171
I looked up,
they were illuminated...

769
00:55:55,773 --> 00:55:58,689
their eyes and teeth
were shining like this...

770
00:55:59,619 --> 00:56:00,735
yeah, like this...

771
00:56:00,901 --> 00:56:03,134
Don't, please, don't scare me.

772
00:56:04,025 --> 00:56:06,418
The faces I saw were grinning.

773
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:08,710
Then I knew...

774
00:56:09,394 --> 00:56:12,196
I knew the fire
was not accidental.

775
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:15,962
And you know
it was not accidental too.

776
00:56:16,965 --> 00:56:21,567
It was an expression, a manifestation
of the need to destroy.

777
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:26,336
That's why I say I believe
in ghosts, in haunted places...

778
00:56:26,498 --> 00:56:28,891
in places haunted by the people
that occupy them...

779
00:56:29,062 --> 00:56:32,902
with hearts overrun by demons
of hate and destruction.

780
00:56:33,068 --> 00:56:35,951
I believe this place,
this house, is haunted.

781
00:56:36,554 --> 00:56:38,752
Aunt Rose, Aunt Rose Comfort.

782
00:56:38,917 --> 00:56:40,512
This house is haunted.

783
00:56:41,161 --> 00:56:44,636
I think I'll go around the back door
and make us some lemonade.

784
00:56:46,168 --> 00:56:47,398
Archie Lee.

785
00:56:47,931 --> 00:56:48,887
Archie Lee?

786
00:56:49,053 --> 00:56:50,328
Archie Lee...

787
00:56:54,861 --> 00:56:56,775
Let's go and see Archie Lee now.

788
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:01,700
Archie Lee.

789
00:57:13,048 --> 00:57:14,483
What's going on up there?

790
00:57:14,692 --> 00:57:16,686
The contraption broke down.

791
00:57:33,681 --> 00:57:36,597
You better stay away from Archie,
he's fit to be tied.

792
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:42,445
Come on, give me that key.
Do you hear?

793
00:57:43,776 --> 00:57:47,091
Archie Lee,
I've got something to tell you.

794
00:57:47,862 --> 00:57:49,058
You left me over there.

795
00:57:49,225 --> 00:57:51,982
I told you never to come here
when niggers are working.

796
00:57:52,149 --> 00:57:53,584
You know...

797
00:57:55,794 --> 00:57:57,435
How's progress, Mr. Meighan?

798
00:57:58,759 --> 00:58:00,878
Fine, fine, great.

799
00:58:01,042 --> 00:58:03,560
Personally, I can't hear
the gin running at all.

800
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:05,849
Big shot!

801
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:07,727
What's going on?

802
00:58:07,892 --> 00:58:08,643
Nothing.

803
00:58:08,813 --> 00:58:10,727
What? Well, that figures.

804
00:58:10,896 --> 00:58:13,653
I inspected your equipment
before I put in my own.

805
00:58:13,821 --> 00:58:16,817
I put up my own gin because
this equipment was rotten.

806
00:58:17,586 --> 00:58:19,626
Was rotten, and still is rotten.

807
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:22,826
It's quarter past two,
you've a lot of wagons out there.

808
00:58:22,995 --> 00:58:23,826
You Italians...

809
00:58:23,996 --> 00:58:25,591
Never mind about we Italians!

810
00:58:25,759 --> 00:58:27,319
Take it easy, now.

811
00:58:27,481 --> 00:58:29,919
Get a new saw cylinder
and get this contraption running.

812
00:58:30,085 --> 00:58:32,444
If you can't get one in town,
go to Rosedale.

813
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:34,284
If you can't get one in Rosedale...

814
00:58:34,532 --> 00:58:38,451
you better get across the river and
keep going right on to Little Rock.

815
00:58:38,618 --> 00:58:43,221
One more crack, and the only cotton
you'll see will be in a drugstore.

816
00:58:44,066 --> 00:58:46,061
Now, you better haul, brother.

817
00:59:03,936 --> 00:59:05,576
I've got something to say to you.

818
00:59:05,738 --> 00:59:07,697
I ain't got time.

819
00:59:08,222 --> 00:59:11,104
Big shot! Big shot!
Big shot!

820
00:59:12,669 --> 00:59:14,822
Boy, he's really getting it.

821
00:59:15,473 --> 00:59:18,436
We've got a saw cylinder like this
in our commissary.

822
00:59:18,598 --> 00:59:21,275
Sure enough?
Go and bring it here...

823
00:59:21,442 --> 00:59:24,199
get Hank to help you put it in
and get this contraption running.

824
00:59:24,887 --> 00:59:28,568
He won't get one in town. If he
crosses the river, don't wait.

825
00:59:29,174 --> 00:59:30,495
Rock...

826
00:59:31,778 --> 00:59:33,817
I'll leave the pick-up truck
with you.

827
00:59:34,101 --> 00:59:37,782
Stay close to the house.
Stay there till I come out.

828
00:59:49,885 --> 00:59:51,320
Archie.

829
00:59:51,488 --> 00:59:53,721
Archie, wait!
Archie Lee!

830
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:15,838
Please, don't touch me.

831
01:00:18,367 --> 01:00:21,409
Aunt Rose,
Aunt Rose Comfort.

832
01:00:21,572 --> 01:00:25,366
I've got to go and see a mighty
sick friend in the county hospital.

833
01:00:28,663 --> 01:00:31,784
You might as well shout at the moon
as that old woman.

834
01:00:40,401 --> 01:00:41,882
You don't want her to go?

835
01:00:42,043 --> 01:00:44,720
She's got no business
leaving me alone here.

836
01:00:47,972 --> 01:00:51,605
But she has a passion
for chocolate candies.

837
01:00:53,259 --> 01:00:56,016
She watches the newspapers
like a hawk...

838
01:00:56,183 --> 01:01:00,148
to see if anyone she knows is
registered at the county hospital.

839
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:01,984
Hospital?

840
01:01:03,274 --> 01:01:07,432
They pass out candy to the patients
at the county hospital, you know.

841
01:01:08,322 --> 01:01:11,922
Friends and relatives send them
flowers and candy.

842
01:01:13,129 --> 01:01:16,730
Aunt Rose goes to visit them and
eats up all the chocolate candy.

843
01:01:22,984 --> 01:01:27,906
Last week, an old lady friend of hers
was dying at the county hospital...

844
01:01:30,115 --> 01:01:32,552
and Aunt Rose Comfort
went to visit her...

845
01:01:32,839 --> 01:01:34,878
and ate up all her chocolate candy.

846
01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:36,443
All of it?

847
01:01:36,685 --> 01:01:38,758
Right while the old woman
was dying.

848
01:01:41,532 --> 01:01:44,573
I like old people, they're crazy.

849
01:01:50,443 --> 01:01:54,124
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

850
01:01:54,489 --> 01:01:56,130
What?

851
01:01:56,292 --> 01:01:58,651
Are you really married
to Mr. Meighan?

852
01:02:00,018 --> 01:02:04,063
Mr. Vacarro, that is
a personal question.

853
01:02:04,384 --> 01:02:07,860
All questions are
more or less personal.

854
01:02:09,953 --> 01:02:11,274
Well...

855
01:02:15,641 --> 01:02:19,162
when I got married...

856
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:22,922
I wasn't ready for marriage yet,
I was only 18.

857
01:02:24,295 --> 01:02:27,610
But, my daddy was practically
on his death bed...

858
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:30,464
and wanted to see me took care of
before he died.

859
01:02:31,385 --> 01:02:35,544
Archie Lee had been hanging around
like a sick dog for some time.

860
01:02:36,272 --> 01:02:38,584
And the boys around here
are a sorry lot.

861
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:42,473
They ask you to the movies and
take you to a stone quarry instead.

862
01:02:42,955 --> 01:02:45,427
You've got to get out of the car
and throw stones at them.

863
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,912
I've had some experiences
with boys...

864
01:02:48,083 --> 01:02:50,156
that would just curl your hair
if I told you.

865
01:02:50,326 --> 01:02:53,323
The experiences
I've had with boys.

866
01:02:57,177 --> 01:03:00,298
Oh, but Archie Lee
was an older fella...

867
01:03:02,024 --> 01:03:04,382
and his business was better
in those days.

868
01:03:05,509 --> 01:03:09,303
He was ginning out most of the cotton
before you put up your gin, remember?

869
01:03:09,796 --> 01:03:11,676
I remember.

870
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:14,880
Well, I told my daddy...

871
01:03:15,044 --> 01:03:17,356
I wasn't ready for marriage.

872
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:20,410
My daddy told Archie Lee
I wasn't ready for it...

873
01:03:20,852 --> 01:03:23,849
and Archie Lee
promised my daddy...

874
01:03:24,017 --> 01:03:26,251
that he would wait
until I was ready.

875
01:03:26,741 --> 01:03:28,735
Then the marriage was postponed.

876
01:03:29,225 --> 01:03:31,263
No, not the wedding.

877
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:35,667
We had the wedding,
my daddy gave me away.

878
01:03:35,834 --> 01:03:37,634
But you said Archie Lee waited?

879
01:03:37,797 --> 01:03:39,597
Yes, after the wedding.

880
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,115
For what?

881
01:03:48,613 --> 01:03:50,847
For me to be ready for marriage.

882
01:03:51,217 --> 01:03:53,496
How long did he have to wait?

883
01:03:53,661 --> 01:03:55,620
Oh, he's still waiting.

884
01:03:59,951 --> 01:04:02,468
We had an agreement.

885
01:04:04,718 --> 01:04:08,113
I told him that on my 20th birthday,
I'd be ready.

886
01:04:08,483 --> 01:04:09,839
That's tomorrow.

887
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:14,085
And, will you be ready?

888
01:04:16,736 --> 01:04:18,330
Well, that all depends.

889
01:04:18,739 --> 01:04:20,299
What on?

890
01:04:21,143 --> 01:04:23,865
Whether or not the furniture
comes back.

891
01:04:28,312 --> 01:04:32,756
Your husband sweats more than any man
I know. Now, I understand why.

892
01:04:34,642 --> 01:04:36,123
Well, let's see.

893
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:37,760
Well, I declare.

894
01:04:42,013 --> 01:04:43,368
I'm sorry.

895
01:04:45,458 --> 01:04:48,216
There, now you wait right there.

896
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:50,947
I'm going to make lemonade
and serve it on the porch.

897
01:04:51,107 --> 01:04:52,337
Yes, ma'am, right here.

898
01:04:52,384 --> 01:04:53,660
You wait right there.

899
01:04:55,268 --> 01:04:56,863
You wait right there.

900
01:04:57,031 --> 01:04:58,672
Yes, ma'am, I'll wait.

901
01:04:59,715 --> 01:05:02,757
I will stay right here.
Yes, ma'am.

902
01:05:28,237 --> 01:05:30,995
I'm going to get a fridge
one of these days.

903
01:05:35,328 --> 01:05:38,484
Stupid old thing.
Forgot to light the stove.

904
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:00,659
We'll be having lemonade
in a minute.

905
01:07:06,511 --> 01:07:09,713
Here, how did you get
that pretty dress all wet?

906
01:07:34,233 --> 01:07:35,714
What a mess.

907
01:08:03,596 --> 01:08:06,319
Mr. Vacarro?
You wait right there.

908
01:08:10,807 --> 01:08:12,766
Archie Lee, is that you?

909
01:08:31,599 --> 01:08:32,874
Needs something.

910
01:10:50,726 --> 01:10:53,164
Get out of my house!

911
01:11:10,716 --> 01:11:14,351
Mr. Vacarro, I know that's you,
and you're making me very nervous.

912
01:11:30,186 --> 01:11:32,339
Help, help, help!.

913
01:12:18,618 --> 01:12:19,848
Open, sesame!

914
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:21,341
Game's over, I quit.

915
01:12:21,623 --> 01:12:24,015
No, you have to keep playing
till you're it.

916
01:12:24,187 --> 01:12:29,143
Would you go back downstairs so I
can unlock this door and come out?

917
01:12:29,475 --> 01:12:31,547
This attic is in awful
weak condition.

918
01:12:31,717 --> 01:12:36,035
Shall I call the fire department to
come with a net to catch you?

919
01:12:36,204 --> 01:12:37,434
There wouldn't be time.

920
01:12:37,606 --> 01:12:39,645
I don't suppose they'd get here
on time.

921
01:12:39,849 --> 01:12:43,973
Any more than they did last night
when a fire burned down my gin.

922
01:12:47,381 --> 01:12:49,420
I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.

923
01:12:49,985 --> 01:12:53,300
I'm going to slip a pencil and paper
under this door.

924
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:55,623
All I want is your signature
on the paper.

925
01:12:55,793 --> 01:12:56,351
What paper?

926
01:12:56,514 --> 01:12:58,827
An affidavit legally stating...

927
01:12:58,998 --> 01:13:01,562
that Archie Lee Meighan
burned down the syndicate gin.

928
01:13:04,166 --> 01:13:08,245
This floor is about to
give out right under me.

929
01:13:08,452 --> 01:13:09,330
It'll just take a minute.

930
01:13:09,494 --> 01:13:13,209
Just leave it there. I'll be happy
to sign it and send it to you.

931
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:17,061
I'm a Sicilian.
We're a very old race of people...

932
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:20,462
and ancient races are
untrustful races by nature.

933
01:13:20,631 --> 01:13:24,424
Either you sign this piece of paper
or I'll break this door down.

934
01:13:25,878 --> 01:13:29,273
Do you hear me?
I gather you don't believe it.

935
01:13:40,019 --> 01:13:43,221
Either you agree
to sign this thing...

936
01:13:43,384 --> 01:13:45,264
or I'm coming out here...

937
01:13:45,427 --> 01:13:47,706
and my additional weight...

938
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:53,768
You'll do what I tell you.

939
01:14:02,143 --> 01:14:03,703
I'll do what you want...

940
01:14:04,466 --> 01:14:06,425
only hurry.

941
01:14:14,922 --> 01:14:15,959
What have I got to do?

942
01:14:16,445 --> 01:14:17,799
Write your name.

943
01:15:30,387 --> 01:15:31,902
You can come out now.

944
01:15:33,952 --> 01:15:36,105
What about the footsteps
on the stairs.

945
01:15:36,276 --> 01:15:37,471
Hear my descending
footsteps on the stairs.

946
01:15:37,638 --> 01:15:39,232
Mr. Vacarro.

947
01:15:40,562 --> 01:15:42,635
Do you hear my footsteps
on the stairs?

948
01:15:44,368 --> 01:15:46,202
Mr. Vacarro.

949
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:52,098
OK, you're home free
and so am I. Bye-bye.

950
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:54,299
Wait, where are you going?

951
01:15:54,984 --> 01:15:57,821
Back to my little grey
Quonset home in the west...

952
01:15:58,349 --> 01:16:00,422
to take a peaceful siesta.

953
01:16:00,753 --> 01:16:02,268
But I want to...

954
01:16:03,156 --> 01:16:05,149
I want to...

955
01:16:09,044 --> 01:16:12,246
Is that all you wanted?

956
01:16:14,212 --> 01:16:16,730
For me to confess that Archie Lee
burned down your gin?

957
01:16:17,777 --> 01:16:19,976
What else did you imagine?

958
01:16:23,025 --> 01:16:24,346
Well...

959
01:16:36,285 --> 01:16:37,960
Mrs. Meighan...

960
01:16:40,572 --> 01:16:42,406
you're a child.

961
01:16:43,737 --> 01:16:46,699
That's why we played
hide and seek...

962
01:16:46,861 --> 01:16:48,935
it's a game for children.

963
01:16:51,228 --> 01:16:53,905
You don't have to go all
the way home to take a nap...

964
01:16:54,072 --> 01:16:55,747
you could take a nap here.

965
01:16:56,917 --> 01:16:58,637
It's going to rain anyhow.

966
01:17:02,564 --> 01:17:05,321
But all the furniture has
been removed from the house.

967
01:17:06,570 --> 01:17:08,609
Not the stuff in the nursery...

968
01:17:09,014 --> 01:17:11,771
there's a small bed in there,
a crib.

969
01:17:15,784 --> 01:17:20,103
You could curl up
and let the slats down...

970
01:17:28,724 --> 01:17:30,843
I'll be happy to accept
the invitation.

971
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,873
Come up and sing me to sleep.

972
01:18:07,021 --> 01:18:10,142
My daddy would turn over
in his grave.

973
01:19:06,269 --> 01:19:09,072
Come on, I'm good for it.
You know I'm good for it.

974
01:19:09,234 --> 01:19:12,390
I'll take it somewhere else
if you don't want it!

975
01:19:12,559 --> 01:19:14,473
Listen, my daddy's watch.

976
01:19:14,682 --> 01:19:16,003
Cash.

977
01:19:16,725 --> 01:19:19,563
The letters of his name
instead of numbers.

978
01:19:19,810 --> 01:19:21,211
I'll leave this watch with you.

979
01:19:21,372 --> 01:19:23,810
- Cash.
- Give it him and get out of here.

980
01:19:25,659 --> 01:19:29,259
Thank you, sir.
I'm much obliged to you.

981
01:19:46,129 --> 01:19:49,649
Will you get this thing going?
Come on, will you?

982
01:19:49,814 --> 01:19:52,811
Shut up.
We're going as fast as we can.

983
01:20:14,772 --> 01:20:17,290
You all must've done some
mighty fast repairs.

984
01:20:17,456 --> 01:20:19,290
No repairs, we put in
a new saw cylinder.

985
01:20:19,459 --> 01:20:20,450
From where?

986
01:20:20,621 --> 01:20:22,421
The boss had one at our place.

987
01:20:22,744 --> 01:20:26,025
How come I wasn't let in
on this bit of information?

988
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:29,067
I just about killed myself.
Where is that wop?

989
01:20:29,394 --> 01:20:31,753
I want an explanation.
Vacarro!

990
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:33,915
Where is he?

991
01:20:34,081 --> 01:20:36,678
- Have you seen the boss?
- No.

992
01:20:36,844 --> 01:20:39,682
- Have you seen the boss?
- No, sir.

993
01:20:41,932 --> 01:20:43,732
Where are my men?

994
01:20:43,895 --> 01:20:47,370
I sent them home.
They're useless.

995
01:20:49,183 --> 01:20:51,063
You keep operating.

996
01:20:56,394 --> 01:20:58,627
You know,
this isn't a bad old gin.

997
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:35,851
Is anybody living here?

998
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:42,338
Is anybody still living
in this house?

999
01:21:59,168 --> 01:22:00,444
It's Archie Lee.

1000
01:22:38,266 --> 01:22:40,419
What happened here?

1001
01:22:41,511 --> 01:22:42,741
What happened here?

1002
01:22:42,913 --> 01:22:44,474
The plaster broke.

1003
01:22:44,636 --> 01:22:47,951
But how, how?
How did that happen?

1004
01:22:48,121 --> 01:22:51,436
How does anything happen?
It just happens.

1005
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:56,852
Ain't I told you not to
slop around in a slip?

1006
01:22:58,577 --> 01:23:01,733
Ain't I told you not to
slop around in a slip?

1007
01:23:02,022 --> 01:23:04,460
Supper's almost ready.

1008
01:23:10,515 --> 01:23:13,592
Breakage alone in that kitchen
would ruin a well to do man.

1009
01:23:14,441 --> 01:23:17,960
Go up and put some decent
clothes on and come back down.

1010
01:23:19,087 --> 01:23:23,405
There's a new bureau in Washington,
the U.W. bureau.

1011
01:23:23,574 --> 01:23:27,493
Do you know what it stands for?
Useless Women!

1012
01:23:28,501 --> 01:23:30,335
They've got secret plans to...

1013
01:23:32,828 --> 01:23:35,220
lock them up and shoot them.

1014
01:23:37,274 --> 01:23:40,636
Shoot them. You heard me,
I said shoot them.

1015
01:23:41,481 --> 01:23:43,714
How about men
that's destructive?

1016
01:23:43,884 --> 01:23:47,769
Do you think they plan to round up
destructive men and shoot them?

1017
01:23:48,692 --> 01:23:50,845
What destructive men
are you talking about?

1018
01:23:51,015 --> 01:23:55,140
Men that blow things up
and burn things down.

1019
01:23:55,622 --> 01:23:59,462
Because they're too evil and stupid
to get along otherwise.

1020
01:24:00,109 --> 01:24:04,428
Competition is too much for them
so they turn criminal.

1021
01:24:05,758 --> 01:24:07,991
They do things like arson...

1022
01:24:08,482 --> 01:24:11,158
the wilful destruction
of property by fire.

1023
01:24:17,454 --> 01:24:18,445
Who said that to you?

1024
01:24:18,656 --> 01:24:21,174
Look what's up there on the porch.

1025
01:24:21,981 --> 01:24:23,496
There's men on the road.

1026
01:24:23,664 --> 01:24:25,862
Who said arson?

1027
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:30,945
Who spoke of wilful destruction?
You never knew them words.

1028
01:24:32,757 --> 01:24:37,475
Sometimes, big shot, you don't seem
to think I'm very intelligent.

1029
01:24:38,646 --> 01:24:41,289
I've been to school
in my life...

1030
01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:43,649
and I'm a magazine reader.

1031
01:24:51,225 --> 01:24:52,741
Who gave that whistle?

1032
01:24:52,908 --> 01:24:55,426
Who gave a wolf whistle
at my wife?

1033
01:24:55,824 --> 01:24:58,786
You just stay on that
side of that fence.

1034
01:24:58,948 --> 01:25:00,099
Stay over there!

1035
01:25:14,451 --> 01:25:17,732
Men from the syndicate plantation,
white and black, mixed...

1036
01:25:17,976 --> 01:25:20,574
heading for the river
with rubber boots on.

1037
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:23,019
I just hope they turn
downstream...

1038
01:25:23,344 --> 01:25:25,908
I just hope turn that corner...

1039
01:25:26,349 --> 01:25:28,913
I'll blast them away
with a shotgun.

1040
01:25:29,073 --> 01:25:30,873
Small dogs give a loud bark.

1041
01:25:31,036 --> 01:25:32,916
No one's going to insult
no woman of mine.

1042
01:25:33,239 --> 01:25:35,711
You take a lot for granted
when you say "mine".

1043
01:25:36,524 --> 01:25:40,205
I came to you today for protection
and what did I get?

1044
01:25:40,370 --> 01:25:42,011
Slapped and sent home.

1045
01:25:42,774 --> 01:25:46,488
I'm telling you, the agreement
between us is over.

1046
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:49,053
You're darn tooting it's over!

1047
01:25:49,264 --> 01:25:54,140
In three hours, the terms of our
agreement will be settled for good.

1048
01:25:54,311 --> 01:25:55,142
Don't count on it.

1049
01:25:55,313 --> 01:25:56,463
Sharp, at midnight.

1050
01:25:56,635 --> 01:25:57,830
Too much has happened here
lately.

1051
01:25:57,997 --> 01:26:00,560
My credit is wide open again.

1052
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:02,913
So is the jailhouse door,
if the truth be known.

1053
01:26:03,083 --> 01:26:04,519
Are you threatening me
with blabbing?

1054
01:26:11,777 --> 01:26:13,098
Archie Lee...

1055
01:26:13,539 --> 01:26:16,900
Mr. Vacarro says he might not
set up a new cotton gin...

1056
01:26:17,105 --> 01:26:19,703
he might let you gin out his cotton
all the time.

1057
01:26:19,869 --> 01:26:21,429
Ain't you pleased?

1058
01:26:22,272 --> 01:26:24,950
He'll come tomorrow
with lots more cotton.

1059
01:26:25,277 --> 01:26:28,114
And while you're ginning it out,
I'll entertain him...

1060
01:26:28,882 --> 01:26:30,956
I'll make lemonade for him.

1061
01:26:31,446 --> 01:26:34,648
It's going to go on and on,
maybe even till next fall.

1062
01:26:37,496 --> 01:26:40,253
It's the good neighbour policy
in practice.

1063
01:26:49,033 --> 01:26:50,992
How long have you
been on the place?

1064
01:26:51,196 --> 01:26:55,434
All this long fall afternoon,
I've imposed on your hospitality.

1065
01:27:01,491 --> 01:27:02,892
Where have you been?

1066
01:27:03,053 --> 01:27:06,095
Taking a nap on
the only remaining bed...

1067
01:27:06,258 --> 01:27:09,255
the crib in the nursery
with the slats let down.

1068
01:27:09,944 --> 01:27:12,017
Something sad about it,
know what I mean?

1069
01:27:12,668 --> 01:27:14,149
Sad?

1070
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:17,033
An unoccupied nursery
in a house...

1071
01:27:17,195 --> 01:27:19,632
and all the other rooms, empty.

1072
01:27:21,561 --> 01:27:23,600
That's no problem of yours.

1073
01:27:23,765 --> 01:27:27,285
The good neighbour policy makes
your problems mine and vice versa.

1074
01:27:28,131 --> 01:27:29,691
Supper's ready, children.

1075
01:27:30,174 --> 01:27:33,296
Didn't you hear us
called into supper?

1076
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:38,305
Are you going to eat here tonight?

1077
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:40,778
Mrs. Meighan asked me
to stay for supper...

1078
01:27:40,809 --> 01:27:44,410
but I wanted to hear the invitation
from the head of the house...

1079
01:27:44,433 --> 01:27:46,666
before I'd feel free to accept.

1080
01:27:48,391 --> 01:27:50,225
What do you say?

1081
01:27:54,869 --> 01:27:56,544
Stay for supper.

1082
01:27:58,515 --> 01:27:59,996
You'll have to take pot luck.

1083
01:28:00,157 --> 01:28:02,037
I wouldn't be putting you out?

1084
01:28:05,526 --> 01:28:08,089
Excuse me, I better
get into my clothes.

1085
01:28:08,570 --> 01:28:11,213
Yes, that would be better.

1086
01:28:56,882 --> 01:28:59,605
Did I understand
you say that...

1087
01:29:03,693 --> 01:29:06,769
you wouldn't build a new gin but
would leave your business to me?

1088
01:29:06,937 --> 01:29:08,008
If that's agreeable...

1089
01:29:08,179 --> 01:29:09,534
I don't know.

1090
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:15,100
I've got to consider the matter.

1091
01:29:15,951 --> 01:29:20,109
Financing is involved,
new equipment...

1092
01:29:23,883 --> 01:29:25,284
Let's go and eat now.

1093
01:29:26,888 --> 01:29:29,405
I've got a pain in my belly.
Sort of...

1094
01:29:30,733 --> 01:29:32,408
heart burn.

1095
01:29:39,145 --> 01:29:41,218
Hey, one more plate
at the table.

1096
01:29:41,629 --> 01:29:44,591
Mr. Vacarro of the syndicate
plantation is staying for supper.

1097
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:49,072
I had no idea company was expected,
I'll just change...

1098
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:51,918
Another place is all
that's called for.

1099
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:58,486
Have you been here all day?

1100
01:29:58,655 --> 01:30:02,654
Have you been here or did you go
to the hospital to eat chocolate?

1101
01:30:02,821 --> 01:30:05,214
Yes, I visited a friend
in the hospital.

1102
01:30:05,385 --> 01:30:07,379
Then you were out...

1103
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:10,543
while I worked like
the hammers of hell!

1104
01:30:10,713 --> 01:30:14,553
I come home to find the attic floor
fell through, my wife insulting...

1105
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:18,160
and a supper of hog slops!

1106
01:30:21,209 --> 01:30:24,250
Sit down, I've got to
make me a phone call.

1107
01:30:32,625 --> 01:30:36,306
Hello, Miss Hopkins,
give me the Bright Spot.

1108
01:30:37,272 --> 01:30:39,790
I can't think of the number,
you give it to me.

1109
01:30:45,525 --> 01:30:47,803
Hello, Bright Spot?

1110
01:30:49,811 --> 01:30:52,488
He's on the phone. If I was you
I wouldn't hang around.

1111
01:30:52,655 --> 01:30:54,410
I've got the ace of spades
in my pocket...

1112
01:30:54,578 --> 01:30:56,651
and I'm not going to give in.

1113
01:30:56,822 --> 01:30:58,303
Don't count on the law court...

1114
01:30:58,464 --> 01:31:00,264
justice here is as deaf and blind
as that old woman.

1115
01:31:00,427 --> 01:31:02,386
I'll do my own justice.

1116
01:31:02,831 --> 01:31:06,625
Get Eddie, Bill,
Butch, Rhodes, anyone.

1117
01:31:07,959 --> 01:31:10,430
Go while he's on the phone.

1118
01:31:10,519 --> 01:31:13,321
You don't know his friends,
they're awful.

1119
01:31:13,483 --> 01:31:14,804
I've seen them.

1120
01:31:16,728 --> 01:31:20,009
I find you different this evening
in some way.

1121
01:31:21,455 --> 01:31:25,214
Never mind that.
Go, while he's on the phone.

1122
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:27,380
Grown up, suddenly.

1123
01:31:42,468 --> 01:31:44,940
There's no place he can run to
in this county.

1124
01:31:46,314 --> 01:31:48,353
You can say that again, boy.

1125
01:32:17,441 --> 01:32:20,404
If you can't leave the place,
send someone.

1126
01:32:20,686 --> 01:32:23,203
Send someone to find him,
do you hear me?

1127
01:32:25,813 --> 01:32:27,168
I'll call you back.

1128
01:32:28,096 --> 01:32:29,691
Poems of nature.

1129
01:32:29,859 --> 01:32:31,340
Never mind poems of nature.

1130
01:32:31,502 --> 01:32:33,062
I'll call you later.

1131
01:32:35,147 --> 01:32:37,460
If I'd only known...

1132
01:32:37,671 --> 01:32:38,661
Put food on the table.

1133
01:32:38,873 --> 01:32:39,545
Just a minute.

1134
01:32:39,714 --> 01:32:41,514
We ain't gonna wait
no minute.

1135
01:32:45,843 --> 01:32:47,802
Bring out some food!

1136
01:33:07,170 --> 01:33:11,692
Is that what they call a Mona Lisa
smile you've got on your puss?

1137
01:33:15,342 --> 01:33:17,460
Put some food on the table!

1138
01:33:17,624 --> 01:33:20,142
Don't pick on Aunt Rose Comfort.

1139
01:33:20,469 --> 01:33:22,622
I'll talk to that woman right now.

1140
01:33:23,313 --> 01:33:25,147
She's outstayed her welcome.

1141
01:33:29,162 --> 01:33:32,158
What a pretty blue ribbon you're
wearing tonight, Mrs. Meighan.

1142
01:33:33,689 --> 01:33:35,728
Thank you, Mr. Vacarro.

1143
01:33:36,293 --> 01:33:38,366
There's so many shades
of blue.

1144
01:33:39,457 --> 01:33:41,611
What particular shade is that?

1145
01:33:41,781 --> 01:33:43,216
It's just baby blue.

1146
01:33:45,827 --> 01:33:47,946
It brings out the blue
in your eyes.

1147
01:33:48,110 --> 01:33:49,227
Food!

1148
01:33:50,434 --> 01:33:51,994
Food!

1149
01:33:56,483 --> 01:33:58,397
This was part of my trousseau.

1150
01:33:59,207 --> 01:34:03,844
I got my trousseau at various stores
in Memphis where my daddy was known.

1151
01:34:05,256 --> 01:34:07,376
What is this stuff? Grass?

1152
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:10,224
Greens. Don't you know greens
when you see them?

1153
01:34:10,464 --> 01:34:13,540
Big department stores
on Main Street...

1154
01:34:13,828 --> 01:34:15,549
This stuff is greens?

1155
01:34:15,711 --> 01:34:18,549
Archie Lee dotes on greens,
don't you?

1156
01:34:18,716 --> 01:34:19,752
No, I don't.

1157
01:34:20,198 --> 01:34:22,351
You don't dote on greens?

1158
01:34:23,082 --> 01:34:24,153
Somebody did...

1159
01:34:24,324 --> 01:34:28,243
Probably, sometime, somewhere.
That don't mean it was me.

1160
01:34:28,731 --> 01:34:32,331
Eat your greens, big shot.
They put iron in the blood.

1161
01:34:32,977 --> 01:34:37,934
I thought he doted on greens.
His likes are hard to keep straight.

1162
01:34:38,906 --> 01:34:40,627
Archie Lee is easy to cook for.

1163
01:34:40,789 --> 01:34:42,589
Take this slop off the table.

1164
01:34:43,714 --> 01:34:46,026
I'll cook you some
eggs Birmingham.

1165
01:34:46,478 --> 01:34:48,517
These greens didn't cook enough.

1166
01:34:47,305 --> 01:34:51,703
I played a fool trick with my stove,
I forgot to light it.

1167
01:34:54,356 --> 01:34:58,879
I left my greens on the stove.
I thought they were boiling.

1168
01:34:59,123 --> 01:35:02,564
When I came home, I discovered
my stove wasn't lit.

1169
01:35:03,049 --> 01:35:06,489
Why do you say "my stove"?
Why is everything "mine"?

1170
01:35:06,653 --> 01:35:07,883
I think you've been drinking.

1171
01:35:08,696 --> 01:35:10,052
You stay out of this.

1172
01:35:10,219 --> 01:35:11,859
Sit down, Aunt Rose.

1173
01:35:13,624 --> 01:35:14,820
What was that, Archie?

1174
01:35:15,467 --> 01:35:16,617
Sit down.

1175
01:35:17,189 --> 01:35:18,340
Where?

1176
01:35:23,879 --> 01:35:25,109
Sit here.

1177
01:35:33,374 --> 01:35:35,014
I'm gonna ask you a question.

1178
01:35:38,662 --> 01:35:40,895
What sort of plans have you made?

1179
01:35:41,827 --> 01:35:44,550
What plans? What sort
of plans do you mean?

1180
01:35:44,711 --> 01:35:46,112
Plans for the future.

1181
01:35:46,273 --> 01:35:49,954
I don't think this discussion
is necessary in front of company.

1182
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:54,243
Mrs. Meighan, when someone feels
uncomfortable over something...

1183
01:35:54,526 --> 01:35:57,602
it often happens he takes out
his annoyance...

1184
01:35:57,970 --> 01:36:00,693
on some completely
innocent person.

1185
01:36:11,671 --> 01:36:12,992
Now, Aunt Rose...

1186
01:36:13,954 --> 01:36:16,837
you've been here since August,
that's a mighty long stay.

1187
01:36:23,330 --> 01:36:25,973
It's my honest opinion that
you are in need of a rest.

1188
01:36:26,976 --> 01:36:30,690
You've been cooking here and
cooking there for how long?

1189
01:36:32,865 --> 01:36:34,061
Well?

1190
01:36:32,502 --> 01:36:35,385
How long have you been cooking
in people's houses?

1191
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:43,023
I've helped out my relatives
whenever they needed me.

1192
01:36:43,909 --> 01:36:47,384
I was always invited, sometimes,
begged to come.

1193
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:51,029
When babies were expected or
somebody was sick...

1194
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:54,161
they called for Aunt Rose
and she was always there.

1195
01:36:56,046 --> 01:36:59,487
Nobody ever had
to put me out.

1196
01:37:02,456 --> 01:37:05,498
Would you excuse me
for a minute...

1197
01:37:08,265 --> 01:37:10,657
I'll go up and pack.

1198
01:37:16,037 --> 01:37:18,760
Miss Rose Comfort, wait.

1199
01:37:21,405 --> 01:37:22,999
I'll drive you home.

1200
01:37:23,328 --> 01:37:25,207
I've got nowhere to go.

1201
01:37:25,371 --> 01:37:26,601
Yes, you do.

1202
01:37:27,294 --> 01:37:29,253
I need a cook.

1203
01:37:29,737 --> 01:37:31,492
I'm tired of my own cooking.

1204
01:37:31,743 --> 01:37:35,378
And I'm anxious to try those
eggs Birmingham you mentioned.

1205
01:37:36,751 --> 01:37:37,901
Is it a deal?

1206
01:37:40,597 --> 01:37:41,314
Well...

1207
01:37:41,478 --> 01:37:43,551
Sure it's a deal, Aunt Rose.

1208
01:37:43,721 --> 01:37:46,114
Mr. Vacarro
will be very good to you.

1209
01:37:46,806 --> 01:37:49,369
You never can tell about
things in the future.

1210
01:37:51,051 --> 01:37:55,176
Yes. I'm going to pack
my things.

1211
01:38:13,646 --> 01:38:16,961
Is there anything else around here
you want to take away?

1212
01:38:22,419 --> 01:38:23,615
Well, is there?

1213
01:38:23,781 --> 01:38:25,455
Yes, Archie Lee.

1214
01:38:26,104 --> 01:38:30,468
Mr. Vacarro noticed that the house
was just full of furniture.

1215
01:38:31,633 --> 01:38:35,552
He'd like to borrow about
five complete sets of it.

1216
01:39:19,584 --> 01:39:21,977
Coloured folks call this
pot liquor.

1217
01:39:23,991 --> 01:39:26,030
I love pot liquor

1218
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:30,395
Good?

1219
01:39:32,003 --> 01:39:34,122
I'm crazy about pot liquor.

1220
01:39:39,133 --> 01:39:40,534
Is it good?

1221
01:39:47,225 --> 01:39:47,817
Good.

1222
01:39:47,986 --> 01:39:49,866
I love it.

1223
01:39:54,156 --> 01:39:56,993
That hen thought she'd been
invited to supper.

1224
01:40:07,736 --> 01:40:10,653
Listen to me!
You all listen to me.

1225
01:40:11,021 --> 01:40:14,986
Quit giving those filthy looks
back and forth and listen to me.

1226
01:40:15,588 --> 01:40:19,873
Do you think I'm deaf,
dumb and blind? Do you?

1227
01:40:21,197 --> 01:40:24,672
Well, you're mistook.
Oh, brother.

1228
01:40:25,123 --> 01:40:27,640
Oh, brother,
you're mighty mistook.

1229
01:40:27,807 --> 01:40:31,007
I know, I know I guess
I look like a...

1230
01:40:32,973 --> 01:40:34,807
I guess I look like...

1231
01:40:34,976 --> 01:40:36,890
What do you guess you look like?

1232
01:40:36,893 --> 01:40:39,730
Some sweet, innocent,
Baby Doll of a wife...

1233
01:40:39,897 --> 01:40:41,652
not ready for marriage.

1234
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:45,739
No, not ready for marriage.
But plenty ready to go out and...

1235
01:40:46,547 --> 01:40:48,860
Wait a minute.
How's it funny?

1236
01:40:49,311 --> 01:40:50,986
It sure is funny, huh?

1237
01:40:52,636 --> 01:40:55,758
There's one little thing
you've overlooked.

1238
01:40:56,803 --> 01:40:59,115
I've got position.

1239
01:41:00,048 --> 01:41:03,329
I've got position in this county
where I was born and brought up.

1240
01:41:04,574 --> 01:41:06,808
I hold a respected position.

1241
01:41:07,379 --> 01:41:10,420
Life long member of every
organisation in the delta.

1242
01:41:12,346 --> 01:41:16,106
And I have friends!
Friends!

1243
01:41:17,033 --> 01:41:20,189
Long standing business associates
and social.

1244
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:25,804
See what I mean? You ain't got
that advantage, have you?

1245
01:41:26,687 --> 01:41:28,760
Have you? Have you?

1246
01:41:29,491 --> 01:41:31,804
Come on, speak up.

1247
01:41:32,456 --> 01:41:35,418
Ain't you a dago?
Excuse me, Italian?

1248
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:38,338
I'm not a doctor, but I was in
medical corps in the navy.

1249
01:41:38,505 --> 01:41:41,546
You've got a very unhealthy look.
Call an ambulance.

1250
01:41:41,627 --> 01:41:45,386
I don't have to make a phone call
I can handle the situation myself.

1251
01:41:45,553 --> 01:41:46,384
What situation?

1252
01:41:46,554 --> 01:41:49,710
The situation I've come home
to find here under my roof.

1253
01:41:57,531 --> 01:41:59,012
Look here, now...

1254
01:42:02,338 --> 01:42:06,657
I'm not such an old fool
I couldn't size it up.

1255
01:42:09,869 --> 01:42:14,154
I sized it up the minute I seen
you were still on this place...

1256
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:20,753
and her with that sly smile on her,
and you with yours on you.

1257
01:42:20,925 --> 01:42:22,759
Well, I know how to wipe off
both those sly smiles.

1258
01:42:21,343 --> 01:42:25,058
Meighan!
You know, and I know...

1259
01:42:25,229 --> 01:42:27,143
and I know you know
that I know...

1260
01:42:27,312 --> 01:42:29,876
that you set fire to
my cotton gin last night.

1261
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:34,152
You burned down
the syndicate gin...

1262
01:42:34,002 --> 01:42:37,637
and I've got here in my hand
a signed affidavit...

1263
01:42:37,808 --> 01:42:40,246
a paper, signed by a witness...

1264
01:42:40,412 --> 01:42:44,252
whose testimony will hold up even
in the law court of Tiger Tail.

1265
01:42:45,339 --> 01:42:48,620
That's what I came here for
and that's all I got.

1266
01:42:48,865 --> 01:42:52,944
Whatever else you suspect,
you're mistaken.

1267
01:42:55,324 --> 01:42:56,759
Isn't that so?

1268
01:42:56,926 --> 01:42:59,569
Isn't your husband mistaken in
thinking I got anything...

1269
01:42:59,730 --> 01:43:03,649
but this signed affidavit which
was the purpose of my whole call?

1270
01:43:05,659 --> 01:43:09,544
I'm foreign, Meighan,
but not revengeful...

1271
01:43:09,906 --> 01:43:11,978
at least, not more
than is rightful.

1272
01:43:13,230 --> 01:43:16,352
We've got a workable good
neighbour policy between us.

1273
01:43:16,555 --> 01:43:20,189
It might work out. Anyhow,
I think it deserves a try.

1274
01:43:21,202 --> 01:43:24,243
As for the other side of the
situation which I won't mention...

1275
01:43:24,407 --> 01:43:29,363
all I'll say is a certain attraction
exists, mutually, I believe.

1276
01:43:30,416 --> 01:43:33,652
I needed a little shut-eye
after last night's excitement...

1277
01:43:33,821 --> 01:43:37,536
and I have a faint recollection
of being sung to by someone...

1278
01:43:39,109 --> 01:43:43,587
a lullaby that was sweet,
and the touch of cool fingers.

1279
01:43:48,363 --> 01:43:49,480
You think I'll put up with this...?

1280
01:43:48,394 --> 01:43:50,034
Situation?

1281
01:43:50,317 --> 01:43:53,678
You went to a whole lot of risk
to get my business back.

1282
01:43:53,962 --> 01:43:55,762
Don't you want it?

1283
01:43:55,965 --> 01:43:57,481
It's up to you.

1284
01:43:57,648 --> 01:43:59,562
Very cool.

1285
01:44:01,575 --> 01:44:04,218
You just fixed your wagon...

1286
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:08,263
with your smart talk
you just fixed your wagon.

1287
01:44:08,865 --> 01:44:13,822
I'm gonna wipe that grin off
your greasy wop face for good.

1288
01:44:17,198 --> 01:44:20,000
Is my wop face greasy,
Mrs. Meighan?

1289
01:44:49,567 --> 01:44:53,042
That's the last time you'll
ever lay your hands on me!

1290
01:44:53,212 --> 01:44:55,810
You stinking stinker!
Stinker!

1291
01:44:56,417 --> 01:44:57,933
Don't shoot him!

1292
01:45:01,584 --> 01:45:04,626
Rock...
Rock, where are you?

1293
01:45:06,231 --> 01:45:08,624
Where are you, Vacarro,
where are you?

1294
01:45:18,049 --> 01:45:20,772
If you're under there,
you ain't getting out.

1295
01:45:28,745 --> 01:45:30,466
My husband's got a gun
and I just don't know...

1296
01:45:42,125 --> 01:45:45,521
Hey, wop!
Yellow bellied wop!

1297
01:45:54,744 --> 01:45:57,307
Get the gun,
get the gun away from him!

1298
01:46:07,843 --> 01:46:09,963
Help!

1299
01:46:22,706 --> 01:46:26,021
Get away.
Where are you, Vacarro?

1300
01:46:26,752 --> 01:46:28,426
I'm right here.

1301
01:46:33,162 --> 01:46:35,201
There you are.

1302
01:46:41,094 --> 01:46:43,658
Oh, it's you. Excuse me.

1303
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:46,210
Silva.

1304
01:46:49,425 --> 01:46:50,416
Here.

1305
01:46:50,587 --> 01:46:52,546
Where are you, Vacarro?

1306
01:46:53,391 --> 01:46:54,382
Come on.

1307
01:47:01,644 --> 01:47:03,045
Baby Doll!

1308
01:47:08,694 --> 01:47:10,255
Where are you, Vacarro?

1309
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:14,221
Where are you?

1310
01:47:15,825 --> 01:47:17,146
Vacarro.

1311
01:47:17,307 --> 01:47:18,662
Vacarro!

1312
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:28,192
Now, you put that gun away.

1313
01:47:48,474 --> 01:47:50,068
Baby Doll!

1314
01:47:51,238 --> 01:47:52,958
Baby...

1315
01:47:54,483 --> 01:47:56,363
Baby Doll...

1316
01:48:13,872 --> 01:48:16,436
Vacarro...

1317
01:48:17,277 --> 01:48:19,715
where are you,
you wop?

1318
01:48:30,337 --> 01:48:31,408
Baby...

1319
01:48:41,513 --> 01:48:42,789
Baby Doll...

1320
01:49:28,984 --> 01:49:31,707
I'm ready.
I'm all ready to go.

1321
01:49:35,514 --> 01:49:36,630
Who is that?

1322
01:49:37,155 --> 01:49:38,795
What's the matter, Sandy?

1323
01:49:38,957 --> 01:49:43,480
Tomorrow's election day, I'm running
for town marshal, I want your vote.

1324
01:49:43,685 --> 01:49:45,804
You've got my vote.

1325
01:49:49,253 --> 01:49:51,976
You're too old for
a job like that...

1326
01:49:52,217 --> 01:49:55,693
I'm 20 years younger and I wouldn't
run for a job like that...

1327
01:49:56,424 --> 01:49:58,178
Age is a factor that calls
for recognition.

1328
01:49:58,347 --> 01:50:02,665
I hope you recognise it's
a factor that calls for recognition.

1329
01:50:03,354 --> 01:50:06,510
A man grows old suddenly,
not gradually...

1330
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:08,794
just, all of a sudden,
he's old.

1331
01:50:10,605 --> 01:50:13,169
Wait a minute,
where are you guys taking me?

1332
01:50:13,409 --> 01:50:15,004
You're acting as though
I'm under arrest.

1333
01:50:15,172 --> 01:50:15,764
You've been shooting.

1334
01:50:15,933 --> 01:50:17,254
There he is.

1335
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:21,775
Get down...

1336
01:50:22,783 --> 01:50:25,585
- Get off me.
- Right, right, come on.

1337
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,640
Hey, what about me?

1338
01:50:36,884 --> 01:50:38,478
Put the handcuffs on him.

1339
01:50:39,528 --> 01:50:44,245
OK. Put me in
that stinking black calaboose.

1340
01:50:44,415 --> 01:50:47,651
I ain't a white man?
No, so throw me in.

1341
01:50:48,742 --> 01:50:50,781
But, don't you leave
my Baby Doll here with him.

1342
01:50:51,346 --> 01:50:54,148
Don't you leave him here
with her.

1343
01:50:55,031 --> 01:50:58,586
You're a married man.
You understand how I feel.

1344
01:50:59,158 --> 01:51:03,282
Don't you, Sandy? Please.
As one white man to another.

1345
01:51:04,566 --> 01:51:07,164
Just for tonight,
don't leave them on the place.

1346
01:51:08,332 --> 01:51:09,767
Just tonight, Sandy.

1347
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:16,537
I've scratched my leg
on the bark of that tree.

1348
01:51:17,064 --> 01:51:18,579
Vacarro, come here.

1349
01:51:18,746 --> 01:51:19,942
Excuse me.

1350
01:51:22,672 --> 01:51:24,347
What have you got on your mind?

1351
01:51:24,515 --> 01:51:28,069
Listen, we ain't got nothing
to hold that old boy on.

1352
01:51:28,241 --> 01:51:32,081
He's been shooting, but he says a
fox has been catching his chickens.

1353
01:51:32,247 --> 01:51:34,890
His chickens?
I've got a signed confession...

1354
01:51:35,051 --> 01:51:37,045
by a material witness
that amounts to an affidavit.

1355
01:51:37,214 --> 01:51:37,772
Let me see.

1356
01:51:37,935 --> 01:51:39,610
Not till it's witnessed
and photographed.

1357
01:51:39,778 --> 01:51:41,133
We'll have it photographed.

1358
01:51:41,300 --> 01:51:43,534
I don't need or want
anything from you.

1359
01:51:43,744 --> 01:51:46,581
I'm going to the county sheriff.
Rock!

1360
01:51:47,430 --> 01:51:49,184
Here, Silva.

1361
01:51:51,236 --> 01:51:53,799
Silva, what about me?

1362
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:55,315
Now?

1363
01:51:58,086 --> 01:52:01,082
I'll be coming back tomorrow
with lots more cotton.

1364
01:52:02,973 --> 01:52:05,411
I'll be back
with lots more cotton.

1365
01:52:20,078 --> 01:52:21,559
Well, he's gone.

1366
01:52:21,721 --> 01:52:22,552
What happens now?

1367
01:52:22,722 --> 01:52:26,037
He's shown us a signed confession
from your wife...

1368
01:52:26,768 --> 01:52:29,332
we'll have to go through this thing
for appearance sake.

1369
01:52:29,973 --> 01:52:32,092
I don't mean that,
I mean...

1370
01:52:35,702 --> 01:52:37,137
What happens tomorrow?

1371
01:52:38,706 --> 01:52:42,671
Well, a town marshal has no control
over tomorrow.

1372
01:53:05,266 --> 01:53:07,305
Today's my Baby Doll's birthday.

1373
01:53:15,761 --> 01:53:17,561
Your friend has forgotten me.

1374
01:53:20,809 --> 01:53:24,774
Archie Lee, it looks like
the celebration is over.

1375
01:53:25,456 --> 01:53:26,686
Let's go.

1376
01:53:28,741 --> 01:53:31,464
He's coming back tomorrow
with more cotton.

1377
01:53:31,625 --> 01:53:33,300
He's coming back?

1378
01:53:52,136 --> 01:53:53,891
Let's go in now.

1379
01:53:56,543 --> 01:53:59,664
We've got nothing to do,
but wait for tomorrow.

1380
01:54:01,510 --> 01:54:05,303
And see if we're remembered...

1381
01:54:06,117 --> 01:54:07,438
or forgotten.

1382
01:54:24,865 --> 01:54:26,699
Oh, my, oh my.
