1
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,695
-Paul Weevo.
-Yes, sir.

2
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:43,360
-Can you hear me?
-Yes, sir, Mr. Archie.

3
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,905
-Can you find the holes?
-Yes, sir, lots of them.

4
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:49,238
-Well, make sure you get the big ones.
-Yes, sir.

5
00:01:59,488 --> 00:02:02,889
-Uncle Pleasant, ain't you got nothing to do?
-Not a thing.

6
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:08,526
-Ain't you going to help him?
-I'm retired.

7
00:02:17,706 --> 00:02:19,230
Baby Doll.

8
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,459
Archie Lee, you're a mess.

9
00:03:53,836 --> 00:03:55,667
Do you know what they call such people?

10
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:57,897
Peeping Toms!

11
00:04:00,476 --> 00:04:03,343
Hey, there's no need for a woman
that sleeps in a baby's crib...

12
00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:04,877
...to stay away from her husband.

13
00:04:05,047 --> 00:04:07,572
I'm gonna plug up the hole
in that wall with chewing gum.

14
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,447
If I ever catch you poking a knife
through it again to peek at me in my sleep...

15
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,485
...I'm moving in
to the Kotton King Hotel.

16
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:17,887
And would you please
keep your filthy old dogs off my furniture.

17
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:21,028
Let me talk to you.

18
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:23,255
-I wanna talk with you.
-Spare your breath.

19
00:04:23,432 --> 00:04:26,492
Save it to drum up some business
for your broken-down cotton gin.

20
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:29,296
-Never mind--
-Close the door so I can get into my clothes.

21
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:30,597
Get in your clothes.

22
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:34,072
Not till you get on the other side
of that door and close it between us.

23
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:37,178
Today is the fifth day of November,
tomorrow is the sixth day...

24
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:39,405
...and the day after that
is November seventh.

25
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:41,845
And you know what day that is,
don't you?

26
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:45,585
November seventh is your 20th birthday.

27
00:04:45,754 --> 00:04:50,088
Ain't that sweet of you to remember.
Where's my birthday present?

28
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:52,784
Oh, you'll get your birthday present.

29
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:56,021
Providing you haven't forgotten
the agreement between us...

30
00:04:56,198 --> 00:04:58,723
...which comes due on that day.

31
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:04,065
-Oh, the agreement?
-Yeah, the agreement.

32
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:07,538
-Which you swore on a Bible to keep.
-Providing you kept yours.

33
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:11,577
-Have I touched you since we were married?
-Yeah, often. And got slapped.

34
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:15,911
Have I? Have I ever--?
Ever once forced myself on you...

35
00:05:16,084 --> 00:05:18,348
...as your husband by law?

36
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,579
But don't the law mean nothing to you.

37
00:05:20,756 --> 00:05:22,690
How about your side of the agreement?

38
00:05:22,858 --> 00:05:26,658
You talked big, mighty big
when you was courting me, big shot.

39
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:30,765
You told my daddy you was gonna put me
in the grandest house in the county.

40
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:34,164
I put you in Tiger Tail.
I bought it and I put you in it.

41
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:36,861
And Tiger Tail is the grandest house
in the county.

42
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,941
Yeah, you put me in Tiger Tail, the biggest
old wreck of a place in the whole delta.

43
00:05:41,109 --> 00:05:43,373
You told my daddy
you was gonna restore this place.

44
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:46,207
Exactly like it was when
the Dobines owned it, only better.

45
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:49,817
"Make a show place," you said.
Yeah, a freak show.

46
00:05:49,985 --> 00:05:53,546
I've got a boy on the roof right now.
I got my man on the roof right now.

47
00:05:53,722 --> 00:05:55,986
-Can't you hear the hammer?
-Is that a hammer?

48
00:05:56,158 --> 00:05:58,149
Why, I thought that was
a king-sized termite.

49
00:05:58,327 --> 00:06:01,160
Doggone, if you ain't
the most ungrateful little--

50
00:06:01,697 --> 00:06:04,495
I have mortgaged myself
to satisfy your demands.

51
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:09,103
You told a mouthful of lies to my daddy
in order to get me.

52
00:06:09,271 --> 00:06:12,604
Get you? I ain't got you yet.

53
00:06:12,975 --> 00:06:14,875
No, and you ain't about to either.

54
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:18,911
Now, I'm telling you that if the Ideal
Pay As You Go Plan Furniture Company...

55
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:22,414
...removes those five complete sets
of furniture from this house...

56
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:26,247
...then that agreement you just spoke about
is automatically canceled.

57
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:30,118
And now, would you kindly go back
in your own room?

58
00:06:31,026 --> 00:06:34,985
I'm gonna get me a good-paying job
while I'm in town today.

59
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:36,755
Just in case.

60
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:39,330
Just in case.

61
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:54,372
Admiring yourself in the mirror.
Yeah, just look at yourself.

62
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,884
You're not exactly a young girl's
dream come true, Archie Lee Meighan.

63
00:06:59,054 --> 00:07:02,182
There was an old witch
Named Granny Crow

64
00:07:02,357 --> 00:07:06,293
Wherever she spit
No grass would grow

65
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:11,964
That old witch must've spit right
on the top of your head, Archie Lee.

66
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:18,163
Thank you. Thank you.

67
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:20,706
You're not a woman.

68
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:24,437
You're a woman not grown,
therefore I make allowances.

69
00:07:27,382 --> 00:07:29,907
Aunt Rose Comfort screams
every time that phone rings.

70
00:07:30,152 --> 00:07:32,643
Why does she do a fool thing
like that?

71
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:34,550
She says phone-ringing scares her.

72
00:07:34,723 --> 00:07:36,850
Aunt Rose,
why don't you answer the phone?

73
00:07:41,597 --> 00:07:44,122
-Aunt Rose?
-My word....

74
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:48,165
Aunt Rose?

75
00:07:49,271 --> 00:07:52,138
Aunt Rose Comfort!

76
00:07:52,307 --> 00:07:55,105
Aunt Rose Comfort!
Why don't you answer that?

77
00:07:55,277 --> 00:07:58,838
I can't catch my breath, Archie Lee,
phone give me such a fright.

78
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:00,845
Answer it.

79
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,713
Hello? This is Miss Rose Comfort
McCorkle speaking.

80
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:09,722
No. The lady of the house
is Mrs. Archie Lee Meighan...

81
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:11,791
...daughter of my brother
who passed away.

82
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,758
They don't wanna know that.
Who is it? What do they want?

83
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,559
I don't hear very well,
would you please speak a little louder?

84
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:24,734
-Oh, the Ideal Pay As You Go Plan.
-Give me that phone.

85
00:08:26,475 --> 00:08:28,943
Now, what is this, boy?

86
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:30,442
Yeah.

87
00:08:30,846 --> 00:08:34,942
Today? Oh, no, you gotta give me
a little more time.

88
00:08:35,117 --> 00:08:38,052
Well, you see, I've had a little setback
in business lately.

89
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,418
The Syndicate Plantation built their own
cotton gin and I've lost their trade.

90
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:46,652
Well, it's gonna take me a little more time
to recover from that.

91
00:08:47,763 --> 00:08:49,628
Then take it out.

92
00:08:49,798 --> 00:08:51,823
Take it out! Out! Out!

93
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,458
You're never gonna get my business again!
No, never.

94
00:09:03,178 --> 00:09:05,942
Archie Lee, you all aren't gonna
lose your fine furniture--

95
00:09:06,114 --> 00:09:08,639
Will you shut up
and get on back in that kitchen.

96
00:09:08,817 --> 00:09:12,514
Don't you speak a word that you heard,
if you heard a word, to my wife.

97
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:16,818
Don't holler no more in this house.
Don't cackle no more.

98
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:19,054
I guarantee, I'll pack you up.

99
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:22,754
I'll pack you up and haul you off
to that county home at Sunset.

100
00:09:22,931 --> 00:09:26,025
What did you say, Archie Lee?
Did you say something to me, Archie Lee?

101
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:29,762
Yeah. I said, shoot!

102
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,676
What made her holler this time?

103
00:09:39,848 --> 00:09:42,681
How do I know what made
that old woman holler this time...

104
00:09:42,851 --> 00:09:44,876
...the last time or the next time
she hollers.

105
00:09:45,053 --> 00:09:48,386
Last time she hollered was because
you throwed something at her.

106
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:50,491
What I ever throw
at Aunt Rose Comfort?

107
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:54,322
A glass of water. And for singing
church hymns in the kitchen.

108
00:09:54,496 --> 00:09:55,827
Water?

109
00:09:55,997 --> 00:09:58,864
Why, this much water,
I barely sprinkled her with it.

110
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:01,764
-Well, she don't hear nothing.
-I know.

111
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:05,370
Well, you gotta do something to get
the old woman's attention, don't you?

112
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,905
Yeah.

113
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:09,534
Hey, hey. Put me down!

114
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:11,269
Get your--

115
00:10:13,248 --> 00:10:17,014
Get your hands off me!
Take them off!

116
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:22,147
I'm....

117
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,183
I'm gonna....

118
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:26,589
I'm moving to the Kotton King Hotel...

119
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:29,629
...the very next time
you try to break our agreement.

120
00:10:29,798 --> 00:10:32,358
The very next time.

121
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:44,908
Baby Doll!

122
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:51,753
Baby Doll!

123
00:10:58,693 --> 00:11:01,184
You come on down here
if you're going into town with me.

124
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:04,196
I gotta be at the doctor's
10 minutes ago.

125
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:21,743
Baby Doll!

126
00:11:22,818 --> 00:11:25,412
If you're so impatient,
just go ahead without me.

127
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:29,956
Just go ahead. I've got plenty of ways
of getting downtown without you.

128
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,786
That's the truth.

129
00:11:37,132 --> 00:11:40,067
You come on!

130
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:56,246
You get your cotton-picking tail
down here.

131
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:09,129
Take your time.

132
00:12:15,337 --> 00:12:17,202
-Morning, Sam.
-Ma'am.

133
00:12:22,644 --> 00:12:24,373
Well, what are you waiting for?

134
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:28,812
Oh, now, come on, get into the car.

135
00:12:28,984 --> 00:12:32,943
I will get in the back seat of that boat
when you get out and walk around...

136
00:12:33,121 --> 00:12:35,919
...and open the door for me
like a gentleman.

137
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:39,652
Well, you're gonna wait a long time
if that's what you're waiting for.

138
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:43,389
Well, I declare.
My father would turn over in his grave.

139
00:12:43,565 --> 00:12:46,659
I never saw your father get out
and open the car door for any woman...

140
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:50,965
...especially not your
waddle-legged mother. Now, get on in!

141
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,986
Hey, Sid!

142
00:13:12,027 --> 00:13:15,121
-Hey, Sid, come here.
-What are we stopping here for?

143
00:13:15,297 --> 00:13:19,165
-What are you doing here?
-Vacarro's got me working for him now.

144
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:22,303
-For him? You're working for him?
-What else could I do?

145
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,633
-Syndicate shut my gin down tight.
-What's going on?

146
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:28,037
Oh, it's a party,
a celebration of some kind.

147
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:30,177
Why shouldn't the Syndicate celebrate?

148
00:13:30,345 --> 00:13:33,075
It's got every last bit of business
in the county.

149
00:13:33,648 --> 00:13:37,311
Including every bit of what I used to get
and every bit of what you used to get.

150
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:41,615
He's got an up-to-date gin,
not like that old pile of junk you got.

151
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,490
When are we getting out of here?

152
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:11,749
Would you mind moving your arm?

153
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:17,154
Happy anniversary.

154
00:14:27,402 --> 00:14:29,267
She sure growed up.

155
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:33,564
I am just as fond of Aunt Rose Comfort as
you are, but I'm in no position to feed and--

156
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:34,970
Now, look here, big shot.

157
00:14:35,143 --> 00:14:38,909
The day Aunt Rose Comfort is unwelcome
under your roof, her and me is moving out.

158
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,308
Well, she can't cook--

159
00:14:40,482 --> 00:14:43,610
If you don't like Aunt Rose's cooking,
get me a regular servant.

160
00:14:43,785 --> 00:14:46,982
You don't think that I am gonna cook
for a big, fat, old thing like you.

161
00:14:47,155 --> 00:14:50,318
-Quit saying "fat, old thing".
-Get young and thin and I'll quit.

162
00:14:50,492 --> 00:14:52,687
All right, but I am serving you notice.

163
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:56,820
If that old woman dies on my place, I ain't
gonna get stuck with the funeral expenses.

164
00:14:56,998 --> 00:14:59,694
I'll have her burned up.
"Cremated" is what they call it.

165
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:01,995
I'll pack her ashes
in an old Coca-Cola bottle...

166
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,468
...and I'll pitch that bottle
into Tiger Tail Bayou.

167
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,130
Mr. Meighan, you are late
for your appointment.

168
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:10,573
The doctor's gonna see you anyway,
I don't know why.

169
00:15:21,222 --> 00:15:22,712
Oh, hey.

170
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:25,315
Well, hi.

171
00:15:25,493 --> 00:15:29,429
-Are you the dentist?
-Yes, ma'am. I'm the dentist.

172
00:15:30,398 --> 00:15:34,232
Well, I was scouting around for a job
and I noticed your sign.

173
00:15:34,402 --> 00:15:36,302
And I thought I might help you out.

174
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:42,003
What are you doing, John?

175
00:15:42,243 --> 00:15:45,940
There was a fellow in here just a little
while ago beat me at playing checkers.

176
00:15:46,114 --> 00:15:48,480
And I still can't figure out why.

177
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,083
Well....

178
00:15:50,885 --> 00:15:53,479
What do you do? Can you type?

179
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,526
No. No, I don't do no typing.
But...

180
00:16:00,095 --> 00:16:02,393
...well, I print a real good hand.

181
00:16:02,964 --> 00:16:06,024
I don't know whether
we can use that, though.

182
00:16:08,603 --> 00:16:11,333
You're awful young to be a dentist.

183
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:15,433
Yeah, I'm just getting started.

184
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:20,241
Well, what's the matter with you?

185
00:16:22,617 --> 00:16:26,075
-I haven't been myself, John.
-In what way?

186
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:34,257
Well, you know, Archie Lee,
you're not an old man...

187
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:36,454
...but you're not a young man
neither no more.

188
00:16:36,631 --> 00:16:38,656
That's the truth, John. That's no lie.

189
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,996
-How long you been married now?
-Just about a year now.

190
00:16:42,804 --> 00:16:44,237
Well....

191
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:49,233
-She's pretty, though.
-Yeah, I guess so.

192
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:51,404
Youth, huh?

193
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:56,340
You've been under some strain,
ain't you?

194
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:59,112
No. No strain at all.

195
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:03,018
-You look mighty nervous to me.
-I'm not nervous--

196
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,632
Well, you'd have to know typing.

197
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:18,166
It's typing.

198
00:17:18,606 --> 00:17:21,700
-Awfully nice talking to you.
-Yes, ma'am.

199
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:30,709
Mr. Meighan, come back in here.
The doctor's gonna give you a prescription.

200
00:17:32,353 --> 00:17:36,813
Archie Lee, all I think you need is
some kind of a little harmless sedative.

201
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:39,516
You take this down to old man Hogan,
tell him to fill it.

202
00:17:39,694 --> 00:17:42,458
-Take it according to directions.
-Here you are.

203
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,995
Don't forget your sweater.

204
00:17:44,165 --> 00:17:47,191
It's not gonna help
what's wrong with you one bit.

205
00:17:51,873 --> 00:17:53,397
-How doing?
-He knows what he's doing.

206
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:58,672
I'm ready to go now. I spent just about
the whole day sitting on Main Street.

207
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:05,447
Why didn't you bring me a double dip?

208
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,921
-How long we gonna sit here?
-I gotta wait for my prescription.

209
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,355
-I'm bored.
-Now, what the sam hill is so funny?

210
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:19,795
Even the Chinamen.

211
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:22,730
You know, people know
the situation between us.

212
00:18:22,904 --> 00:18:25,771
Yesterday on Front Street,
a man called out to me and said:

213
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,875
"Hey, Archie Lee, has your wife
outgrowed the crib yet?"

214
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,044
Three or four others ha-ha'ed at me.

215
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:34,943
Public humiliation.

216
00:18:35,116 --> 00:18:38,517
Private humiliation is just as painful.

217
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:45,218
There's no torture on Earth to equal
the torture a cold woman inflicts on a man.

218
00:18:45,393 --> 00:18:47,884
There's no torture to compare with it.

219
00:18:48,296 --> 00:18:49,991
I've staked out a lot in hell.

220
00:18:50,164 --> 00:18:54,225
A lot with a rotten house on it and
five complete sets of furniture not paid for.

221
00:18:54,402 --> 00:18:57,701
What you done is bit off more
than you could chew.

222
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:08,949
-Archie Lee, is that our furniture?
-No, no. No, it isn't. No.

223
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:14,350
They're taking away our stuff!
Why are you just standing there?

224
00:19:14,522 --> 00:19:16,387
I gotta wait for my prescription.

225
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:19,082
-Your prescription? Mr. Hannum!
-Look out now.

226
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,252
-Come here!
-Wait!

227
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:26,457
Let's get on home before they get
the rest of it. I'm going. Don't you--

228
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:30,968
-Baby Doll!
-Don't you dare take my furniture!

229
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:34,372
-You best go get her.
-Yeah, I guess I better.

230
00:19:36,444 --> 00:19:38,503
-What would you do?
-Get tough on her.

231
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,706
Yeah, easy to say. Come on.

232
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,924
Look out, here comes trouble.

233
00:19:54,028 --> 00:19:56,861
-What we do about those people?
-Just keep loading the truck.

234
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:59,659
Get out of my chair!
Go on, get out!

235
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:02,598
-They have all my furniture.
-Baby Doll, honey.

236
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:06,866
-Are you crazy, that's my mama's lamp.
-Honey. Honey!

237
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,441
She better not hit me again.

238
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,909
-Hey, you put that back!
-Better not hit me.

239
00:20:22,023 --> 00:20:25,220
I thought I heard something
rattling around in there.

240
00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:36,596
-Baby Doll.
-Leave me alone in here.

241
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:40,332
I don't wanna be in a room with a man
that would make me live with no furniture.

242
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:41,736
Oh, honey, I--

243
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:44,776
My daddy would turn over in his grave
if he knew.

244
00:20:44,946 --> 00:20:49,280
If your daddy turned in his grave
as often as you say he'd turn in his grave...

245
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,146
...that old man would plow up
the graveyard.

246
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,349
Look at your Aunt Rose.

247
00:20:54,522 --> 00:20:58,686
She's out there picking roses in the yard
just as if nothing at all happened in here.

248
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,294
I'm moving to the Kotton King Hotel.

249
00:21:01,963 --> 00:21:06,525
I am moving to the Kotton King Hotel!
I'm gonna get me a good-paying job.

250
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:10,000
The manager of the Kotton King Hotel
helped carry my daddy's coffin.

251
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:11,433
He'll give me work.

252
00:21:11,606 --> 00:21:13,972
What sort of work
do you think you could do?

253
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:15,803
I could curl hair in a beauty parlor.

254
00:21:15,977 --> 00:21:19,208
-Oh, I can see that.
-I reckon that I could be a hostess.

255
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,847
Second floor's all clear now.

256
00:21:21,015 --> 00:21:23,415
-Smile at people coming in a place.
-What place?

257
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,747
Any place. I could be a cashier.

258
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:28,889
Oh, now, you can't count change.

259
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:34,688
Well, I could pass out menus
or programs or something.

260
00:21:34,862 --> 00:21:36,591
-Say hello to people.
-Oh, now, Baby--

261
00:21:36,764 --> 00:21:39,028
I can say hello.

262
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,594
Sign here.

263
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:47,970
Kotton King, this is Mrs. Meighan.

264
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:51,578
I wanna reserve a room
for tomorrow morning.

265
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:56,774
I wanna register under my maiden name
which is Baby Doll Carson McCorkle.

266
00:21:56,951 --> 00:22:01,752
My daddy was T.C. Carson McCorkle,
who died last summer when I got married.

267
00:22:01,923 --> 00:22:06,622
And he was a very close personal friend
of the manager of the Kotton King Hotel.

268
00:22:06,794 --> 00:22:08,159
You know.

269
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,623
What's his name?

270
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:21,704
Archie Lee, look at these flowers.
Poems of nature.

271
00:22:35,723 --> 00:22:39,454
When we gonna gin out
some more cotton, Mr. Archie?

272
00:22:56,544 --> 00:22:58,375
Oh, my.

273
00:22:59,914 --> 00:23:01,347
Oh, my.

274
00:23:14,362 --> 00:23:16,592
-Come on!
-Good, I got you.

275
00:23:16,764 --> 00:23:20,723
-I bet he don't make $2.
-Yeah, all right.

276
00:23:20,902 --> 00:23:23,530
That's the stoutest brandy water
ever wet my whistle.

277
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:27,140
It must have come right out
of Tiger Tail Bayou.

278
00:23:27,308 --> 00:23:30,334
Young man? Mr. Vacarro?

279
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:34,470
A mighty fine party you're throwing
tonight in honor of your first anniversary...

280
00:23:34,649 --> 00:23:37,846
...as the manager of
the Syndicate Plantation and Gin.

281
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:41,113
Just a minute there, sonny, hold it down.

282
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:43,821
I got a little something I ought
to get off my chest.

283
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:45,891
Don't forget your point.

284
00:23:46,527 --> 00:23:49,291
-Us good neighbors appreciate this--
-Just a second, sir.

285
00:23:49,697 --> 00:23:51,255
Gentlemen, an announcement:

286
00:23:51,432 --> 00:23:54,196
There'll be a fish fry Saturday night.

287
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:59,635
Catfish, hush puppies, dancing.
Bring your ladies.

288
00:24:00,942 --> 00:24:02,409
Oh, you go right on, sir.

289
00:24:02,577 --> 00:24:06,172
I just want you to know that us good
neighbors appreciate your achievement...

290
00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:10,647
...in bringing in the biggest cotton crop
that ever was picked on this blessed soil...

291
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:12,149
...of Tiger Tail County.

292
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,618
Hey, senator, my old dad once said:

293
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:18,657
"Blessed is he who has nothing to say
and cannot be persuaded to say it".

294
00:24:18,826 --> 00:24:20,521
A couple boys there
don't look happy.

295
00:24:20,695 --> 00:24:24,028
They got no reason to be.
You put them out of business.

296
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:28,232
-Man, they got plenty good liquor yonder.
-I'll drink my own.

297
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:35,398
Now, when you first came here...

298
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:38,739
...I admit that us old-timers
were a bit standoffish.

299
00:24:38,913 --> 00:24:41,746
We didn't know you all that well at first.

300
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:43,144
Naturally.

301
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:46,775
A thing is profitable to some,
is unprofitable to others.

302
00:24:46,954 --> 00:24:51,323
As the fellow says, "One man's meat
is another man's poison".

303
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,058
We all know that some folks here
have suffered financially...

304
00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:59,256
...due in some measure to this man's
success with his Syndicate Plantation.

305
00:24:59,634 --> 00:25:03,400
But as a whole, the community stands
to reap a nice fat profit.

306
00:25:03,571 --> 00:25:04,799
Hey, senator...

307
00:25:04,972 --> 00:25:08,931
...next time run on a Republican ticket,
we'll get the nigger vote out for you.

308
00:25:12,713 --> 00:25:17,446
-Silva! Mr. Silva!
-Mr. Silva! Mr. Silva!

309
00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:22,279
Fire!

310
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:25,989
Mr. Silva! Mr. Silva!

311
00:25:37,104 --> 00:25:41,734
Move the wagons! Move them!
Get that cotton moving!

312
00:25:47,648 --> 00:25:50,412
Get that cotton moving!
Get those wagons!

313
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:54,076
Mr. Silva, where are you?

314
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:30,549
Kerosene can.

315
00:26:51,946 --> 00:26:55,347
Marshal, what you gonna do about
finding the man that burned down my gin?

316
00:26:55,516 --> 00:26:58,349
Well, what makes you so sure
your gin was set fire to?

317
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,612
Look around.

318
00:27:00,988 --> 00:27:03,923
Did you ever see so many happy faces?

319
00:27:04,091 --> 00:27:07,754
It looks like a rich man's funeral
with all his relations attending.

320
00:27:07,928 --> 00:27:09,555
I'd hate to have to prove that.

321
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,029
I'd hate to have to depend on you
to prove it.

322
00:27:14,568 --> 00:27:17,731
I can't honestly imagine.
If it's a case of arson, who done it?

323
00:27:17,905 --> 00:27:21,739
Every poor man you put out of business
was right there when the fire broke out.

324
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:24,002
One wasn't. I know one that wasn't.

325
00:27:24,178 --> 00:27:26,806
Naming names that sound suspicious
is risky business.

326
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:28,380
I didn't name a name.

327
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:31,109
It looks like whoever did it
forgot to take this with him.

328
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:35,949
Marshal, as your deputy, I'll take this can
and I'll examine it very carefully.

329
00:27:36,123 --> 00:27:40,059
See if there's any basis for thinking
it's you who started the fire.

330
00:27:40,227 --> 00:27:43,196
I had to run through fire to get this can
and I mean to keep it.

331
00:27:43,364 --> 00:27:45,628
Lock it up in the pickup truck.

332
00:27:58,045 --> 00:28:00,707
Hey, Gina, sing us a song.

333
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:27,501
Hey, what you gonna do about
ginning out the rest of your cotton?

334
00:28:27,675 --> 00:28:30,235
I'll truck it over to Sunset.

335
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:33,202
Collins will gin it out for me.

336
00:28:33,914 --> 00:28:35,814
Collins got his own cotton to gin,
fella.

337
00:28:35,983 --> 00:28:38,144
Then I'll truck it over to Bolivar County.

338
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,913
Ain't nobody around here
gonna gin it out for me.

339
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:49,392
Silva!

340
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:55,596
Rock?

341
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:58,932
-Give it--
-It's me, Rock.

342
00:28:59,106 --> 00:29:01,097
-He got the can, boss.
-What? Who? Who?

343
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:05,006
I don't know, it was somebody.
Jumped me from the rear.

344
00:29:07,348 --> 00:29:09,942
Just stay back. Stay back.

345
00:29:12,887 --> 00:29:18,553
Boy, take the advice of an old-timer
who was born and raised in this county.

346
00:29:18,726 --> 00:29:22,560
Knows every nigger, every hound dog,
every toadstool...

347
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,358
...and every tree stump
for 50 miles around you.

348
00:29:25,566 --> 00:29:28,729
My advice is for you not to make
any more reckless charges.

349
00:29:28,903 --> 00:29:32,134
Being a foreigner, you already
got strike one and strike two against you.

350
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:35,707
I want no advice, no law,
no court in this county.

351
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:41,508
I come from a country where it's tradition
for each man to make his own justice.

352
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:48,345
Like bootlegged liquor, private, in secret,
because there was corruption there too.

353
00:29:48,522 --> 00:29:53,858
And if justice was executed,
it was executed by each man himself, alone.

354
00:29:54,261 --> 00:29:59,460
I mean, Biblical justice.
Eye for eye, tooth for tooth.

355
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:01,701
Let's go, Rock.

356
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:23,316
Don't notice this, I got to.

357
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,856
I hadn't noticed a thing.

358
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:34,526
Which one did it, Rock, do you know?

359
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:37,569
They were all there in the shed,
all except one.

360
00:30:37,738 --> 00:30:40,400
The one that wasn't there,
I figure he did it.

361
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:46,971
Well, he's the one that's gonna gin
out my cotton.

362
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,436
Get her up.

363
00:31:23,117 --> 00:31:25,176
The furniture's coming back today.

364
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:28,446
-Have mercy.
-Come on, get, get.

365
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,420
Don't say a word.

366
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:42,296
A little bird told me you'd be bringing
those wagons of cotton to my door.

367
00:31:42,469 --> 00:31:45,029
I want you to know
that you're a very lucky fella.

368
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:47,332
-How come?
-I mean, that I am in a position...

369
00:31:47,508 --> 00:31:50,534
...to hold back the other orders
and give you a priority.

370
00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:53,407
Come on. Get out of that truck
and have some coffee with me.

371
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,344
-What's your price?
-You remember my price. It hasn't changed.

372
00:31:56,517 --> 00:32:00,317
-Equipment hasn't changed either?
-A-1 shape. You ought to remember that.

373
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:02,785
I remember you needed a new saw.
You got one?

374
00:32:02,956 --> 00:32:06,221
Well, I can't find one on the market
to equal the old one yet.

375
00:32:06,393 --> 00:32:10,193
Come on. Have some coffee with me.
We're all ready for you.

376
00:32:11,065 --> 00:32:14,557
I guess when you saw my gin burning
down last night, you must've figured...

377
00:32:14,735 --> 00:32:17,966
...you might get a good deal of business
thrown your way in the morning.

378
00:32:18,138 --> 00:32:20,129
You wanna know something?

379
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:23,774
I'm always glad to know something
when there's something to know.

380
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:28,142
I never did see that fire of yours
last night. No, sir.

381
00:32:28,315 --> 00:32:29,543
No, sir. Come on.

382
00:32:29,716 --> 00:32:31,707
Come on in my house,
have some coffee with me.

383
00:32:31,885 --> 00:32:35,377
You, you come too. Come on.
Come on, man.

384
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:38,319
No, sir. I never did see
that fire of yours last night.

385
00:32:38,492 --> 00:32:41,586
We hit the sack after supper
and I didn't know until breakfast...

386
00:32:41,762 --> 00:32:43,195
...your cotton gin burned down.

387
00:32:43,363 --> 00:32:46,127
Oh, Baby Doll? Come out here.
Come here. Come here, Baby Doll.

388
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,963
I want you to come over here and meet
Mr. Vacarro from the Syndicate Plantation.

389
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:52,105
-What's your first name, Vacarro?
-Silva.

390
00:32:52,272 --> 00:32:55,469
-How do you spell it?
-Capital S-I-L-V-A.

391
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:57,906
Sure enough? Like a silver lining?

392
00:32:58,078 --> 00:33:00,945
Well, every cloud has got a silver lining.

393
00:33:01,115 --> 00:33:03,208
Oh, what's that from, the Bible?

394
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,312
No, the Mother Goose book.

395
00:33:07,721 --> 00:33:10,087
That name sounds foreign.

396
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:12,020
It is, Mrs. Meighan.

397
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:15,389
I'm known as the wop that runs
the Syndicate Plantation.

398
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:18,861
Don't call yourself names.
Let the other folks call you names.

399
00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:20,932
Well, you sure are a lucky fella, Silva.

400
00:33:21,101 --> 00:33:23,831
Gold- or even nickel-plated.
Oh, you sure are lucky...

401
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:26,131
...that I could take a job on
of your size right now.

402
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:29,571
You're my closest neighbor, and
I believe in the good-neighbor policy.

403
00:33:29,743 --> 00:33:32,871
You do me a good turn
and I do you a good turn, Mr. Vacarro.

404
00:33:33,046 --> 00:33:37,244
Tit for tat and tat for tit
is the policy we live on. Yes, sir.

405
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:39,317
Aunt Rose? Aunt Rose Comfort!

406
00:33:39,486 --> 00:33:42,080
Oh, Baby Doll. Baby Doll.

407
00:33:42,256 --> 00:33:45,623
Baby, get your daddy's sister to
bring out a pot of coffee for Mr. Vacarro.

408
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:48,522
-Get her yourself.
-Honey.

409
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:52,131
Honey. Honey! Honey!

410
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:55,291
Now, I want you to entertain
this gentleman.

411
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:58,734
Oh, look. Look, look, look.
Oh, look at her blush. Look.

412
00:33:58,906 --> 00:34:01,568
Look at her blush.
Oh, this is my baby.

413
00:34:01,742 --> 00:34:05,109
Oh, this my little girl.
Every precious ounce of her is mine.

414
00:34:07,347 --> 00:34:10,942
Aunt Rose? Aunt Rose Comfort!

415
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:22,123
Excuse my yawn.
But we was up awful late last night.

416
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,827
So you're a wop.

417
00:34:28,535 --> 00:34:32,596
No, I'm a Sicilian, Mrs. Meighan.
A very ancient people.

418
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:36,968
No, "Sic". Sicilian.

419
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:39,442
I'm from Corpus Christi.

420
00:34:39,613 --> 00:34:41,513
Oh, how unusual.

421
00:34:41,682 --> 00:34:42,876
Honey!

422
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:46,850
At noon, take Mr. Vacarro to the
Kotton King Hotel for a chicken dinner.

423
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,250
Sign my name.

424
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,849
It's only when bad luck hits,
Mr. Vacarro...

425
00:34:52,025 --> 00:34:54,550
...you find out who your friends are,
I mean to prove it.

426
00:34:54,728 --> 00:34:57,959
Baby Doll, I want you to entertain
this gentleman in the house.

427
00:34:58,131 --> 00:35:01,066
It's a good-neighbor policy,
tit for tat and tat for tit.

428
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:04,398
You do me a good turn and I do you
a good turn sometime in the future.

429
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:07,404
That's right. Come on now.
Come on, Baby Doll, come on.

430
00:35:07,574 --> 00:35:10,839
Now, make those wagons move now.
Get them rolling.

431
00:35:11,678 --> 00:35:13,976
There ain't nobody comfortable
in that house.

432
00:35:14,147 --> 00:35:17,275
Like if you can find a chair
to sit down on.

433
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,552
Do you want coffee?

434
00:35:21,088 --> 00:35:24,546
No, just a cool drink of water.
Thank you, ma'am.

435
00:35:24,725 --> 00:35:27,489
Well, the house water runs warm.

436
00:35:27,661 --> 00:35:30,425
But if you got the energy to work
that old pump over there...

437
00:35:30,597 --> 00:35:34,624
...you could get yourself a nice cool drink
from that there cistern.

438
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:37,603
I got energy to burn.

439
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:55,819
Dump their garbage in the yard.

440
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:58,253
Ignorance and indulgence and stink.

441
00:35:58,425 --> 00:36:00,552
I thought young Mrs. Meighan
smelled pretty good.

442
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:03,161
You keep your nose to the cotton.

443
00:36:03,463 --> 00:36:05,988
Sometimes water comes,
sometimes it don't.

444
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:08,600
Well, this time it will.

445
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:15,699
Bring me a drink
of that nice cool well water, please.

446
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:19,975
"So you're a wop".

447
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,310
I don't have the strength anymore
in my arm that I used to...

448
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:28,317
...to draw water out of that well.

449
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:30,149
Would you like a cool drink of water?

450
00:36:30,324 --> 00:36:33,452
How do you do?
I'm Aunt Rose Comfort McCorkle.

451
00:36:33,627 --> 00:36:38,394
My brother was Baby Doll's daddy,
Mr. T.C. Carson McCorkle.

452
00:36:38,899 --> 00:36:42,164
I've been visiting here since....

453
00:36:42,736 --> 00:36:46,672
Well, just now I can't remember
just when it was since.

454
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,138
I hope you don't mind
drinking out of a gourd.

455
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:50,776
Oh, thank you.

456
00:36:55,749 --> 00:36:57,341
Excuse me, please.

457
00:36:57,584 --> 00:37:01,680
That old hen Fuss has got back
in my kitchen again.

458
00:37:02,923 --> 00:37:05,050
I can think of worse ways
to spend a afternoon...

459
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:08,626
...delivering cool well water
to Mrs. Meighan.

460
00:37:15,202 --> 00:37:19,400
You stay with the cotton, you hear?
Go on, stay with the cotton.

461
00:37:25,512 --> 00:37:27,377
There's such a difference in water.

462
00:37:27,547 --> 00:37:30,846
You wouldn't think so,
but there certainly is.

463
00:37:32,018 --> 00:37:35,283
I take it you've not had this place long,
Mrs. Meighan.

464
00:37:35,455 --> 00:37:38,083
No, we ain't had it long.

465
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,958
Don't you have garbage collectors
on Tiger Tail Road?

466
00:37:44,631 --> 00:37:48,123
Oh, well, it costs a little bit extra
for them to come out here.

467
00:37:48,301 --> 00:37:50,292
And Archie Lee....

468
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:54,600
Oh, I don't know.
I almost give up sometimes.

469
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:01,377
Did I understand you to say you got a
bunch of unfurnished rooms in this house?

470
00:38:01,548 --> 00:38:03,448
Five complete sets of furniture...

471
00:38:03,617 --> 00:38:07,815
...hauled away by the Ideal Pay As You Go
Plan Furniture Company.

472
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:12,247
When did this misfortune fall upon you?

473
00:38:12,692 --> 00:38:14,489
Yesterday.

474
00:38:14,661 --> 00:38:16,959
Ain't that awful? Yesterday.

475
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:20,122
Both of us had misfortunes
on the same day.

476
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:23,394
You lost your furniture,
my cotton gin burned down.

477
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,231
Oh, yeah.

478
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:27,965
-Quite a coincidence.
-What's that?

479
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:30,939
I said, it was coincidence of misfortune.

480
00:38:31,111 --> 00:38:37,243
Oh, why, sure. I mean, what can you do
with a bunch of unfurnished rooms?

481
00:38:39,453 --> 00:38:43,287
Well, we could play hide-and-seek.

482
00:38:43,457 --> 00:38:46,290
Not me, I'm not athletic.

483
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,092
Yeah, well, when I arrived
in this county...

484
00:38:49,262 --> 00:38:52,425
...to take over the management
of the Syndicate Plantation...

485
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:55,534
...this house was empty.
I was told it was haunted.

486
00:38:55,702 --> 00:39:00,230
Oh, yeah, it was haunted. That's why
Archie Lee got it for almost nothing.

487
00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:03,308
Sometimes I don't know
where to go or what to do.

488
00:39:03,477 --> 00:39:07,174
Well, that's not uncommon.
People enter this world without instruction.

489
00:39:07,948 --> 00:39:09,609
I said--

490
00:39:09,783 --> 00:39:12,616
Is that your breakfast, Mrs. Meighan?

491
00:39:14,754 --> 00:39:19,589
I said, people come into this world without
instruction of where to go or what to do.

492
00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:23,195
So they wander a little
and then go away.

493
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:26,389
Drift for a while and then vanish.

494
00:39:26,566 --> 00:39:29,091
And so make room for newcomers.

495
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,463
Old goers...

496
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:34,072
...newcomers...

497
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:38,507
...going and coming, back and forth.
Rush, rush.

498
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:41,270
Permanent...

499
00:39:41,448 --> 00:39:42,881
...nothing.

500
00:39:44,518 --> 00:39:46,884
Anything living...

501
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:50,147
...that lasts long enough
to take it serious....

502
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:53,488
What's this?

503
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,652
This is that old Pierce-Arrow car,
belong to Mrs. Dobine.

504
00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:00,288
The lady that used to own this house
and haunts it now.

505
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:02,332
Where to, madam?

506
00:40:02,502 --> 00:40:05,130
We're gonna play chauffeur.

507
00:40:06,973 --> 00:40:08,804
Yeah, goodbye now.

508
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:11,210
Hey.

509
00:40:11,378 --> 00:40:15,314
Drive me along the river
with all the windows open to cool me off.

510
00:40:15,815 --> 00:40:19,307
-The chauffeur sits in the front seat.
-Front seat's got no cushion.

511
00:40:19,486 --> 00:40:20,612
Oh, yeah.

512
00:40:20,787 --> 00:40:25,554
Come on, men, get on your big feet,
let's go! Come on!

513
00:40:25,725 --> 00:40:27,488
Oh, let's gin some cotton.

514
00:40:27,661 --> 00:40:32,291
Come on, men. Get on those big feet.
Let's get in here.

515
00:40:32,465 --> 00:40:34,865
Oh, let's cut some cotton.

516
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:38,995
It's hard to find a place to sit...

517
00:40:39,172 --> 00:40:42,266
...since the Ideal Pay As You Go Plan
Furniture Company lost patience.

518
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:44,501
-To sit in comfort--
-Hard to sit in comfort...

519
00:40:44,678 --> 00:40:48,273
...when the Ideal Pay As You Go Plan
people lose their patience...

520
00:40:48,481 --> 00:40:50,949
...and your gin burns down.

521
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:01,551
-Would you move your leg?
-But it's cool here.

522
00:41:01,728 --> 00:41:03,992
Comfortable to sit in.

523
00:41:04,731 --> 00:41:08,223
-What's this here?
-That's my charm bracelet.

524
00:41:08,401 --> 00:41:10,869
My daddy gave it to me.

525
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:13,298
Them's the Ten Commandments.

526
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:16,772
-And these here?
-My birthdays.

527
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:20,807
How many charming birthdays
have you had?

528
00:41:21,014 --> 00:41:24,279
As many as there are charms
on the bracelet.

529
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:26,881
-Mind if I--?
-Count them.

530
00:41:33,259 --> 00:41:38,822
Fourteen, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

531
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:40,694
That's all.

532
00:41:41,201 --> 00:41:42,964
I'll be 20 tomorrow.

533
00:41:43,136 --> 00:41:47,334
Tomorrow is election day
and my birthday...

534
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:51,466
...and the day that Mr. Franklin Delano
Roosevelt was elected for his first term.

535
00:41:52,112 --> 00:41:55,639
It's a great day for the country
for both reasons.

536
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:59,384
Oh, he was a man to respect.

537
00:41:59,552 --> 00:42:02,817
Well, you're a lady to respect,
Mrs. Meighan.

538
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:05,423
Me? No.

539
00:42:05,592 --> 00:42:08,186
I never got past the fourth grade.

540
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:10,261
Why'd you quit?

541
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:14,594
Well, I had a great deal of trouble
with long division.

542
00:42:14,768 --> 00:42:16,065
Yeah?

543
00:42:16,236 --> 00:42:18,227
The teacher would send me
to the blackboard...

544
00:42:18,405 --> 00:42:21,499
...to work on a problem
in long division...

545
00:42:21,675 --> 00:42:24,041
...and I would go up
to the blackboard...

546
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:30,672
...and lean my head against it
and just cry and cry and cry.

547
00:42:32,118 --> 00:42:34,609
Would you move your leg?

548
00:42:35,922 --> 00:42:38,152
Do you wanna move my leg?

549
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:41,486
Yeah, otherwise I can't get out.

550
00:42:42,462 --> 00:42:44,259
Okay.

551
00:42:45,131 --> 00:42:46,120
Well...

552
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:51,503
...I would just cry and cry and cry.

553
00:42:51,671 --> 00:42:54,572
Well, finally I left school and....

554
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:59,474
Oh, a girl without education
is a girl without educ--

555
00:43:00,547 --> 00:43:02,606
Mr. Vacarro?

556
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:06,280
Just picking up a few pecan nuts.

557
00:43:08,488 --> 00:43:10,149
Excuse me.

558
00:43:10,323 --> 00:43:13,656
Excuse me, Mr. Vacarro,
but I wouldn't dream of eating a nut...

559
00:43:13,827 --> 00:43:16,489
...which a man had cracked
in his mouth.

560
00:43:16,663 --> 00:43:19,496
You've got many refinements.

561
00:43:19,866 --> 00:43:21,561
Thank you.

562
00:43:22,435 --> 00:43:27,771
Now, I don't think you need worry
about your failure at long division.

563
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:30,535
After all, you got through short division.

564
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:34,202
Short division's all a lady
ought to be called on to cope with.

565
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,972
Yeah.

566
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:38,008
Well...

567
00:43:38,184 --> 00:43:40,846
...I ought to be going in now.

568
00:43:46,025 --> 00:43:51,088
But I get so depressed going through
all them empty rooms.

569
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:53,027
All the rooms empty?

570
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:57,363
All except the nursery and the kitchen.
The stuff in them rooms is paid for.

571
00:43:57,537 --> 00:43:59,801
You have a child in the nursery?

572
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:02,840
Me? No.

573
00:44:03,009 --> 00:44:05,341
I sleep in the nursery myself.

574
00:44:05,512 --> 00:44:08,106
I let the slats down on the crib.

575
00:44:08,281 --> 00:44:10,875
Why do you sleep in the nursery?

576
00:44:12,218 --> 00:44:16,552
Mr. Vacarro, that's a personal question.

577
00:44:21,294 --> 00:44:25,424
Well, I ought to be going in now.

578
00:44:35,508 --> 00:44:39,444
But, you know, there are rooms
in that house that I never been in.

579
00:44:39,612 --> 00:44:42,103
Like, for instance, the attic.

580
00:44:42,749 --> 00:44:46,651
You know that most of the time I'm scared
to go in that house by myself?

581
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,345
You take like last night,
when the fire broke out.

582
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:53,390
I sat here for hours and hours and hours
waiting for Archie Lee to come home...

583
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,791
...because I was scared to go
in that house by myself.

584
00:44:56,963 --> 00:45:00,160
It must've been scary here without
your husband to look after you.

585
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:02,392
Oh, I'm telling you.

586
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:07,666
The fire broke out and lit up the whole sky
with crazy shadows.

587
00:45:07,841 --> 00:45:10,139
We didn't have a Coke in the house.

588
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:12,141
I was mad at Archie Lee.

589
00:45:12,312 --> 00:45:14,439
You were mad at Mr. Meighan?
What about?

590
00:45:14,614 --> 00:45:17,310
He went off and left me
without a Coke in the house.

591
00:45:17,483 --> 00:45:21,817
-Went off and left-- Without a Coke, did he?
-Yes, he did. He certainly did.

592
00:45:21,988 --> 00:45:25,424
And he didn't get back until way
after the fire had broken out.

593
00:45:25,592 --> 00:45:31,258
And I got smoke in my eyes,
in my nose, in my throat.

594
00:45:32,732 --> 00:45:36,395
I was in such a worn-out,
nervous condition, I cried.

595
00:45:36,569 --> 00:45:41,063
Finally, I took two teaspoons
of paregoric.

596
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:44,335
Sounds like you passed
a very uncomfortable night.

597
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:49,470
Oh, sounds like. But it was.

598
00:45:51,017 --> 00:45:53,952
So Mr. Meighan, you say,
disappeared after supper?

599
00:45:56,222 --> 00:46:00,454
You say Mr. Meighan left the house
for a while after supper?

600
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:03,354
Oh, yeah, for a moment.

601
00:46:03,529 --> 00:46:05,224
Just for a moment, huh?

602
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:08,359
How long a moment?

603
00:46:08,534 --> 00:46:11,731
-What are you driving at, Mr. Vacarro?
-Driving at?

604
00:46:11,905 --> 00:46:14,339
Yes, you're looking at me so funny.

605
00:46:14,507 --> 00:46:18,204
How long a moment did he disappear for?
Can you remember, Mrs. Meighan?

606
00:46:18,378 --> 00:46:20,505
Well, what difference does it make?
I mean...

607
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,774
-...what does it matter to you anyway?
-Why should you mind my asking?

608
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:26,009
You make it sound like
I'm on trial for something.

609
00:46:26,185 --> 00:46:28,415
Don't you like to pretend
like you're a witness?

610
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:35,618
-Witness of what, Mr. Vacarro?
-Oh, say, for instance, a case of arson.

611
00:46:37,263 --> 00:46:38,491
What's arson?

612
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:41,930
The willful destruction
of property by fire.

613
00:46:42,101 --> 00:46:43,159
What?

614
00:46:43,903 --> 00:46:47,669
Well, about-- About my husband leaving
after supper, I can explain that.

615
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,364
-Can you?
-Oh, sure I can.

616
00:46:49,542 --> 00:46:52,636
Well, good. Now, how can you explain it?

617
00:46:54,147 --> 00:46:58,675
What's the matter, Mrs. Meighan?
Can't you collect your thoughts?

618
00:47:00,586 --> 00:47:03,453
Your mind's a blank on the subject?

619
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:10,194
You find it impossible to remember just what
your husband disappeared for after supper?

620
00:47:11,431 --> 00:47:15,561
You can't imagine what kind of errand
he went on, can you? Can you?

621
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:18,130
But when he returned...

622
00:47:18,304 --> 00:47:23,037
...well, let's see, the fire had just
broken out at the Syndicate Plantation.

623
00:47:25,011 --> 00:47:27,775
I can't imagine what
you could possibly be driving at.

624
00:47:27,947 --> 00:47:29,676
No?

625
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:33,649
You're a very unsatisfactory witness,
Mrs. Meighan.

626
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:38,649
Well, shall we drop the subject?

627
00:47:39,025 --> 00:47:42,620
-Oh, I sure do wish you would.
-Well, sure.

628
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:47,722
There's no use crying
over a burnt-down gin.

629
00:47:50,336 --> 00:47:53,100
Besides, like your husband says...

630
00:47:53,473 --> 00:47:57,773
...this world is built
on the principle of tit for tat.

631
00:47:59,312 --> 00:48:01,405
What do you mean by that?

632
00:48:04,717 --> 00:48:06,412
Nothing specific.

633
00:48:10,056 --> 00:48:12,388
-Would you mind if I--?
-What?

634
00:48:12,558 --> 00:48:14,583
Sit down.

635
00:48:14,761 --> 00:48:18,322
-Is it strong enough to support us both?
-Well, I hope.

636
00:48:19,298 --> 00:48:22,096
Now, let's swing a little, huh?

637
00:48:22,268 --> 00:48:25,328
You seem all tense.

638
00:48:25,505 --> 00:48:28,030
Motion relaxes people.

639
00:48:28,674 --> 00:48:30,608
It's like a cradle.

640
00:48:30,777 --> 00:48:33,712
A cradle relaxes a baby.

641
00:48:35,114 --> 00:48:38,447
-They call you Baby, don't they?
-Oh, that's sort of a nickname.

642
00:48:38,618 --> 00:48:41,712
Well, in a swing you can relax
just like in a cradle.

643
00:48:41,888 --> 00:48:44,049
Well, I don't like to swing.
It shakes me up.

644
00:48:44,223 --> 00:48:46,316
I'm relaxed enough,
as much as necessary.

645
00:48:46,492 --> 00:48:49,325
Oh, no, you're not.
Your nerves are all tied up.

646
00:48:49,495 --> 00:48:52,396
-Well, you make me nervous.
-Just swinging with you?

647
00:48:52,565 --> 00:48:54,726
-No, not just that.
-What else, then?

648
00:48:54,901 --> 00:48:57,267
All them questions you asked me
about the fire.

649
00:48:59,138 --> 00:49:02,369
I was only inquiring
about your husband.

650
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:05,036
About his leaving the house
after supper.

651
00:49:05,445 --> 00:49:09,438
But there's no reason why
I should have to explain things to you.

652
00:49:09,782 --> 00:49:11,579
No.

653
00:49:11,751 --> 00:49:13,742
Should we just relax?

654
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:21,923
Would you move over
and make a little room?

655
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:28,763
-Is that enough room for you?
-It's enough for me. How about you?

656
00:49:31,504 --> 00:49:34,632
It was a lovely remark
your husband made.

657
00:49:35,174 --> 00:49:38,007
The good-neighbor policy, I mean.

658
00:49:39,312 --> 00:49:43,646
"You do me a good turn
and I'll do you one".

659
00:49:45,184 --> 00:49:47,414
That was the way he put it.

660
00:49:55,161 --> 00:49:57,721
-There now.
-Thanks.

661
00:49:57,897 --> 00:50:01,355
There's a lot of fine cotton lint
floating around in the air.

662
00:50:01,534 --> 00:50:04,401
I know there is.
It bothers my sinus.

663
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:07,971
Well, you're a very delicate woman,
Mrs. Meighan.

664
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:12,010
Delicate? Me?

665
00:50:12,178 --> 00:50:17,172
There isn't much of you,
but what there is is choice.

666
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,381
Delectable, I might say.

667
00:50:21,387 --> 00:50:24,117
You are fine-fibered.

668
00:50:24,857 --> 00:50:26,757
Soft.

669
00:50:26,993 --> 00:50:29,359
Smooth.

670
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:34,864
Mr. Vacarro, our conversation certainly
is taking a personal turn.

671
00:50:35,034 --> 00:50:38,401
You make me think of cotton. No.

672
00:50:39,372 --> 00:50:42,273
No fabric or cloth...

673
00:50:42,441 --> 00:50:46,537
...not even satin or silk cloth...

674
00:50:46,712 --> 00:50:48,373
...and no kind of fiber...

675
00:50:48,548 --> 00:50:51,312
...not even cotton fiber...

676
00:50:51,984 --> 00:50:55,545
...has the absolute delicacy
of your skin.

677
00:50:55,788 --> 00:50:58,621
Well, what should I say,
thanks or something?

678
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:01,157
Now, you just smile, Mrs. Meighan.

679
00:51:01,327 --> 00:51:04,262
You've got an attractive smile.

680
00:51:05,131 --> 00:51:06,257
-Dimples.
-No.

681
00:51:06,432 --> 00:51:10,095
Oh, yes, you do.
Come on now, smile, Mrs. Meighan.

682
00:51:10,269 --> 00:51:13,261
There, you see? You do.
You do have them.

683
00:51:13,439 --> 00:51:16,670
Don't touch me. Please don't touch me.
I don't like to be touched.

684
00:51:16,842 --> 00:51:18,969
Well, why do you giggle?

685
00:51:19,145 --> 00:51:22,273
Because you make me feel
kind of hysterical, Mr. Vacarro.

686
00:51:22,448 --> 00:51:23,881
I do?

687
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:26,985
-Mr. Vacarro?
-Yes?

688
00:51:29,155 --> 00:51:32,750
I think I'll go and make us
some lemonade.

689
00:51:33,993 --> 00:51:36,359
What did you do that for?

690
00:51:36,529 --> 00:51:40,397
I don't wanna be deprived of the pleasure
of your company.

691
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,427
Not yet.

692
00:51:43,836 --> 00:51:47,101
Oh, Mr. Vacarro,
you certainly are getting familiar.

693
00:51:47,273 --> 00:51:49,434
Don't you have any fun-loving spirit
about you?

694
00:51:49,609 --> 00:51:51,406
Well, this isn't fun.

695
00:51:51,577 --> 00:51:53,875
Well, why do you giggle, then?

696
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:57,508
-Because I'm ticklish.
-You're ticklish?

697
00:51:58,651 --> 00:52:00,778
Don't be so skittish.

698
00:52:01,887 --> 00:52:04,685
All right, I'll get up, then.

699
00:52:07,994 --> 00:52:09,484
Go on.

700
00:52:18,371 --> 00:52:20,862
I feel so weak.

701
00:52:32,885 --> 00:52:36,286
My head is buzzy.

702
00:52:37,623 --> 00:52:39,090
Buzzy?

703
00:52:41,727 --> 00:52:44,457
Fuzzy and buzzy.

704
00:52:50,102 --> 00:52:53,094
My head is swinging round.

705
00:52:58,077 --> 00:53:00,910
Must have been that swinging
that done it.

706
00:53:23,669 --> 00:53:25,500
-Is there something on my arm?
-No.

707
00:53:25,671 --> 00:53:29,129
Well, then cut it out, it feels funny.

708
00:53:29,308 --> 00:53:33,404
-How does it feel?
-Oh, it feels funny all up and down.

709
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:36,810
-Quit switching me, will you?
-I'm just shooing the flies off.

710
00:53:36,982 --> 00:53:38,950
They don't hurt nothing.

711
00:53:39,118 --> 00:53:43,384
-Now, cut it out or I'm gonna call.
-You're gonna call who?

712
00:53:44,757 --> 00:53:47,317
-Boy on the road.
-Well, go on, call then.

713
00:53:48,561 --> 00:53:50,552
Boy!

714
00:53:52,898 --> 00:53:54,991
Can't you call any louder?

715
00:53:55,167 --> 00:53:57,431
-Oh, I feel so--
-Can't you call any louder?

716
00:53:57,603 --> 00:53:59,764
I feel so funny. What's--?

717
00:53:59,939 --> 00:54:02,533
-What's the matter with me?
-You're just relaxing.

718
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:06,405
-Give in, now. Stop fighting it.
-Oh, I'm not....

719
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:09,207
-I'm not fighting it, but it's you...
-I?

720
00:54:09,382 --> 00:54:10,849
...and your suspicions...

721
00:54:11,016 --> 00:54:16,113
-...about my husband. Suspicions--
-Suspicions? Suspicions such as?

722
00:54:16,288 --> 00:54:17,846
That he burnt down your gin.

723
00:54:18,023 --> 00:54:20,184
-Well?
-Well, he didn't.

724
00:54:20,359 --> 00:54:23,795
-Didn't he?
-No, he didn't.

725
00:54:24,497 --> 00:54:27,091
He-- He didn't.

726
00:54:27,266 --> 00:54:30,292
I'm going in the house now.

727
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:33,063
You believe in ghosts, Mrs. Meighan?

728
00:54:33,272 --> 00:54:37,504
I do. I believe in the presence
of evil spirits.

729
00:54:37,743 --> 00:54:40,075
What evil spirits you talking about?

730
00:54:40,246 --> 00:54:43,704
Spirits of violence and cunning...

731
00:54:43,883 --> 00:54:49,116
...malevolence, cruelty, treachery,
destruction.

732
00:54:49,288 --> 00:54:51,586
Them's just human characteristics.

733
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:56,819
The evil spirits that haunt the human heart
and take possession of it...

734
00:54:56,996 --> 00:55:01,092
...and spread from one human heart
to another human heart...

735
00:55:01,267 --> 00:55:04,202
...the way a fire goes
springing from leaf to leaf...

736
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:08,773
...and branch to branch in a tree
till a forest is all aflame with it.

737
00:55:08,941 --> 00:55:11,068
You just got fire on the brain.

738
00:55:11,243 --> 00:55:14,007
I see it as more than it seems
to be on the surface.

739
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:17,980
I saw it last night as an explosion
of those evil spirits.

740
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:24,646
I fought it. I ran into it, beating it,
stamping it, shouting the curse of God at it.

741
00:55:24,824 --> 00:55:29,193
They dragged me out suffocating.
I was defeated.

742
00:55:29,361 --> 00:55:31,852
When I came to,
lying on the ground...

743
00:55:32,031 --> 00:55:33,862
...the fire had won the battle.

744
00:55:34,033 --> 00:55:36,297
And all around was a ring
of human figures.

745
00:55:37,169 --> 00:55:40,434
I looked up. They were illuminated.

746
00:55:40,606 --> 00:55:44,098
Their eyes, their teeth were shining
like this.

747
00:55:44,276 --> 00:55:46,642
-Yeah, like this. Like this.
-No, don't scare me.

748
00:55:46,812 --> 00:55:51,579
-Please don't scare me.
-The faces I saw were grinning.

749
00:55:51,884 --> 00:55:53,852
And then I knew.

750
00:55:54,019 --> 00:55:57,682
I knew the fire was not accidental.

751
00:55:58,357 --> 00:56:01,690
And you know it was not accidental too.

752
00:56:01,861 --> 00:56:06,889
It was an expression,
a manifestation of the need to destroy.

753
00:56:07,066 --> 00:56:09,398
And so I say I believe in ghosts...

754
00:56:09,568 --> 00:56:11,126
...in haunted places...

755
00:56:11,303 --> 00:56:13,771
...in places haunted by the people
that occupy them...

756
00:56:13,939 --> 00:56:17,602
...with hearts overrun by demons
of hate and destruction.

757
00:56:17,776 --> 00:56:21,041
I believe his place, this house,
is haunted.

758
00:56:21,213 --> 00:56:25,775
-Aunt Rose. Aunt Rose Comfort!
-This house is haunted.

759
00:56:25,951 --> 00:56:28,977
I think I'm going around the back door
and make us some lemonade.

760
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,723
-Archie Lee.
-Archie Lee, huh?

761
00:56:33,893 --> 00:56:35,690
Archie Lee.

762
00:56:39,498 --> 00:56:42,126
Yeah, let's go see Archie Lee now.

763
00:56:45,037 --> 00:56:46,902
Archie Lee.

764
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:01,809
-What's going on up there?
-Contraption broke down.

765
00:57:18,237 --> 00:57:21,001
You better stay away from Mr. Archie,
he's fit to be tied.

766
00:57:23,943 --> 00:57:25,604
It's stuck. Give me the wrench.

767
00:57:25,778 --> 00:57:28,178
Come on, give me the wrench, man.
Give--

768
00:57:28,347 --> 00:57:31,646
Archie Lee, I got something to tell you,
you big slob.

769
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:33,875
-What are you doing here?
-You left me there.

770
00:57:34,053 --> 00:57:36,749
I tell you never to come here
when niggers are working here.

771
00:57:36,922 --> 00:57:38,480
You know what you left me with--?

772
00:57:40,359 --> 00:57:42,088
How's progress, Mr. Meighan?

773
00:57:43,362 --> 00:57:45,489
Fine, fine. Great, great.

774
00:57:45,664 --> 00:57:48,792
Personally, I can't hear
the gin running at all.

775
00:57:49,001 --> 00:57:51,162
Big shot!

776
00:57:51,337 --> 00:57:52,770
-What's holding up?
-Nothing.

777
00:57:52,938 --> 00:57:54,599
-Rock?
-The cylinder is busted.

778
00:57:54,773 --> 00:57:58,140
It figures. Meighan, I inspected your
equipment before I put in my own.

779
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:01,507
And I put up my own cotton gin
because this equipment was rotten!

780
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,012
-Take it easy.
-Was rotten and still is rotten.

781
00:58:04,183 --> 00:58:06,117
-It's quarter past 2.
-Don't get hysterical.

782
00:58:06,285 --> 00:58:08,549
-You got wagons out on the runway.
-You Italians--

783
00:58:08,721 --> 00:58:11,087
-Never mind about "we Italians"!
-Take it easy.

784
00:58:11,256 --> 00:58:14,316
You better get a new saw cylinder
and get this contraption running.

785
00:58:14,493 --> 00:58:16,484
If you can't get one in town,
go to Rosedale.

786
00:58:16,662 --> 00:58:18,994
-This contraption--
-If you can't get one there...

787
00:58:19,164 --> 00:58:23,328
-...get across the river and go to Little Rock.
-I'll get one. I'll get one, but--

788
00:58:23,502 --> 00:58:28,496
One more crack out of you and the only
cotton you'll see will be in a drugstore.

789
00:58:28,674 --> 00:58:31,541
Now you better haul, brother.

790
00:58:39,685 --> 00:58:42,449
He'll go to Rosedale.

791
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:52,519
-I got something to say to you, big shot.
-Please, I ain't got-- I ain't got time.

792
00:58:52,698 --> 00:58:56,657
Big shot, big shot, big shot!
This gin!

793
00:58:57,036 --> 00:58:59,504
Boy, he's getting her again.

794
00:58:59,938 --> 00:59:02,805
Yep, we got a saw cylinder like this
in our commissary.

795
00:59:02,975 --> 00:59:04,567
Sure enough.

796
00:59:04,743 --> 00:59:09,112
Go bring it here, get Hank to help you.
And get this contraption running again.

797
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:13,513
He's not gonna get a new one in town. If
he has to cross the river, don't wait for him.

798
00:59:13,686 --> 00:59:14,983
Rock.

799
00:59:16,155 --> 00:59:20,683
I'll leave the pickup truck with you.
Stay close to the house.

800
00:59:20,859 --> 00:59:23,020
Stay there till I come out.

801
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:37,033
Hey, Archie. Archie Lee!

802
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:40,802
Archie Lee! Archie!

803
00:59:56,826 --> 01:00:00,387
No, don't touch me.
Please don't touch me.

804
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:05,991
Aunt Rose. Aunt Rose Comfort.

805
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:10,629
Gotta go see a mighty sick friend
in county hospital.

806
01:00:13,043 --> 01:00:16,911
You might as well shout at the moon
as that old woman.

807
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:26,219
You don't want her to go?

808
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:30,257
Well, she's got no business
leaving me alone here.

809
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:36,254
But she has a passion
for chocolate candy, though.

810
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:40,500
She watches the newspapers
just like a hawk...

811
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:44,538
...to see if anybody she knows is
registered at the county hospital.

812
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:46,573
-The hospital?
-Yeah.

813
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:52,443
They pass out candy to the patients
at the county hospital, you know.

814
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:57,245
Friends and relatives send them
flowers and candy.

815
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:01,982
Aunt Rose Comfort goes to visit them
and eats up all the chocolate candy.

816
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:10,256
Last week, an old lady friend
of Aunt Rose Comfort's...

817
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:12,901
...was dying at the county hospital.

818
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:16,971
And Aunt Rose Comfort
went to visit her...

819
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:20,735
-...and ate up all her chocolate candy.
-All?

820
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:24,641
Right while the old woman was dying,
she ate it all.

821
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:29,618
I like old people. They're crazy.

822
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:39,061
Mrs. Meighan, do you mind
if I ask you a personal question?

823
01:01:39,229 --> 01:01:40,890
What, Mr. Vacarro?

824
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:43,897
Are you really married to Mr. Meighan?

825
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:49,064
Mr. Vacarro, that is a personal question.

826
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:53,198
All questions are more or less personal,
Mrs. Meighan.

827
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:56,302
Well....

828
01:01:58,114 --> 01:01:59,513
See...

829
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:01,678
...when I....

830
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:06,220
When I got married, well,
I wasn't ready for marriage yet.

831
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,789
I was only 18.

832
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:12,495
But my daddy was practically
on his deathbed...

833
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:15,961
...and he wanted to see me took care of
before he died.

834
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:21,035
And old Archie Lee had been hanging
around like a sick dog for quite some time.

835
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:23,297
And the boys around here are a sorry lot.

836
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:27,671
They ask you to the movies and take you
out to the old stone quarry instead.

837
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:30,278
You gotta get out of the car
and throw stones at them.

838
01:02:30,447 --> 01:02:35,146
I've had some experiences here with boys
that would curl your hair if I told you.

839
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:38,481
The experiences
which I've had with boys.

840
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,652
Oh, but...

841
01:02:42,025 --> 01:02:46,052
...old Archie Lee, you know,
he was an older fella.

842
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:50,061
Well, his business was better
in those days.

843
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:51,757
He was ginning out lots of cotton.

844
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:54,563
That's before you put up your cotton gin,
you remember?

845
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:56,500
Yeah, I remember.

846
01:02:56,673 --> 01:03:02,202
Well, I told my daddy
that I wasn't ready for marriage...

847
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:05,643
...and my daddy told Archie Lee
that I wasn't ready for it...

848
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:11,378
...and Archie Lee promised my daddy
that he would wait until I was ready.

849
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:16,992
-Then the marriage was postponed?
-Oh, no, not the wedding.

850
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,524
We had the wedding.
My daddy gave me away.

851
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:24,360
-But you said Archie Lee waited.
-Yeah, after the wedding, he waited.

852
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:26,126
For what?

853
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:35,742
For me to be ready for marriage.

854
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:38,244
Well, how long did he have to wait?

855
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:40,814
Oh, he's still waiting.

856
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:47,349
We had an agreement, though.

857
01:03:47,724 --> 01:03:53,026
I mean, I told him that
on my 20th birthday, I'd be ready.

858
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,164
That's tomorrow.

859
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:59,260
And are--? Will you be ready?

860
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:05,065
-Well, that all depends.
-What on?

861
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:08,935
Whether or not the furniture comes back.

862
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:12,808
I guess.

863
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:17,816
Your husband sweats more than any man
I know, and now I can understand why.

864
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:21,083
Well, let's see.

865
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:22,918
Well, I declare.

866
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:28,424
I'm sorry. I--

867
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:32,858
There. Now you wait right here.

868
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:35,561
I'm gonna make lemonade
and serve it on the porch.

869
01:04:35,738 --> 01:04:39,435
-Yes, ma'am, right here.
-You wait right there.

870
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:43,739
-Now, you wait right there.
-Yes, ma'am, I'll wait.

871
01:04:44,514 --> 01:04:47,745
Yes, ma'am, I will stay right here.
Yes, ma'am.

872
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:16,472
I'm gonna get me a Frigidaire
one of these days.

873
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:24,213
Stupid old thing.
Forgot to light the stove.

874
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,685
Mr. Vacarro?

875
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:46,293
Oh, my goodness. We'll be having lemonade
in a minute now.

876
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:54,170
Here, how'd you get that pretty dress
all wet?

877
01:07:18,735 --> 01:07:20,862
What a mess.

878
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:51,488
Mr. Vacarro, now, you wait right there.

879
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:57,369
Archie Lee, is that you?

880
01:08:15,892 --> 01:08:17,757
It needs something.

881
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:20,242
Who's in there?

882
01:10:34,864 --> 01:10:37,958
Get out of my house.
What are you doing in my house?

883
01:10:40,636 --> 01:10:42,467
Get out of my house.

884
01:10:54,884 --> 01:10:59,287
Mr. Vacarro, I know that's you
and you're making me very nervous.

885
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:03,954
Oh, yeah! I'll get you!

886
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:18,934
-Help! Help! Help!
-Oh, you!

887
01:12:02,585 --> 01:12:05,577
-Open sesame.
-Game's over. I quit.

888
01:12:05,755 --> 01:12:08,189
No, you gotta play
hide-and-seek till you're it.

889
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:10,917
Now, Mr. Vacarro, would you please
go back downstairs...

890
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:13,323
...so that I can unlock this door
and come out?

891
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:15,430
This attic is in awful weak condition.

892
01:12:15,598 --> 01:12:20,035
You want me to call the fire department
to catch you when you fall through?

893
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:23,797
-No, there wouldn't be time.
-I don't suppose they'd get here on time.

894
01:12:23,973 --> 01:12:28,808
Any more than last night when they come
to put out the fire that burnt down my gin.

895
01:12:31,414 --> 01:12:33,575
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

896
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:37,250
Now, I'm gonna slip pencil and paper
under this door...

897
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,718
...and all I want is your signature
on the paper.

898
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:42,153
-What paper?
-You might call it an affidavit...

899
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:46,351
...legally stating that Archie Lee Meighan
burned down the Syndicate Gin.

900
01:12:48,164 --> 01:12:51,531
Mr. Vacarro! This floor's about to give out
right underneath me.

901
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:54,829
-Any minute. What do you say?
-Just leave it right there...

902
01:12:55,004 --> 01:12:57,404
...and I'll be happy to sign it
and send it to you.

903
01:12:57,573 --> 01:12:59,165
Mrs. Meighan, I'm a Sicilian.

904
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:01,935
You know, we're a very old race
of people, an ancient race.

905
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:04,375
And ancient races aren't
trusting races by nature.

906
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:09,484
You're either gonna sign this piece of paper
or I'm gonna break this door down.

907
01:13:09,652 --> 01:13:11,347
Do you hear me?

908
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:13,954
I gather you don't believe me.

909
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:26,893
Now, you're either gonna agree
to sign this thing...

910
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,136
...or I'm coming out here...

911
01:13:29,305 --> 01:13:31,330
...and my additional weight--

912
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:39,112
-What am I gonna do?
-You're gonna do what I tell you.

913
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:44,583
No?

914
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:51,491
No, don't hurt me.
I'll do anything, only hurry.

915
01:13:59,502 --> 01:14:02,630
-What do you want me to do?
-You can write your name.

916
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:08,096
Go ahead.

917
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:17,044
You can come out now.

918
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,941
Need my descending footsteps
on the stairs?

919
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:24,210
-Hear my footsteps on the stairs?
-Oh, Mr. Vacarro!

920
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:28,655
You hear my descending footsteps
on the stairs?

921
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:31,352
Mr. Vacarro?

922
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:35,922
-Mr. Vacarro.
-Okay, you're home free and so am I.

923
01:15:36,232 --> 01:15:39,463
-Bye-bye.
-Wait a minute, where you going?

924
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:42,832
Back to my little gray Quonset home
in the west...

925
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:45,200
...to take a peaceful siesta.

926
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:47,205
Well, I want to....

927
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,741
I want to....

928
01:15:53,816 --> 01:15:56,250
Was that all that you wanted?

929
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:01,813
Me to confess that Archie Lee
burnt down your gin?

930
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:04,982
What else did you imagine,
Mrs. Meighan?

931
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:09,424
Well....

932
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:22,944
Mrs. Meighan, I....

933
01:16:25,114 --> 01:16:27,548
You're a child, Mrs. Meighan.

934
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:31,211
That's why we played
the game of hide-and-seek.

935
01:16:31,387 --> 01:16:33,651
It's a game for children.

936
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:38,524
Well, you don't have to go
all the way home to take a nap.

937
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:40,855
You could take a nap here.

938
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:43,388
I mean, it's gonna rain anyhow.

939
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:50,402
All the furniture's been removed
from the house.

940
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:53,301
Not the stuff in the nursery.

941
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:57,138
There's a small bed in there, a crib.

942
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:02,274
You could curl up...

943
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,480
...and let the slats down.

944
01:17:13,262 --> 01:17:16,095
I'll be happy to accept the invitation.

945
01:17:38,087 --> 01:17:40,521
Come on up and sing me to sleep.

946
01:17:51,567 --> 01:17:54,593
My daddy would turn over in his grave.

947
01:18:50,993 --> 01:18:52,927
-Sorry.
-No, come on. I'm good for it.

948
01:18:53,095 --> 01:18:54,653
-I got orders.
-I'll take my trade--

949
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:57,424
-No credit.
-I'll take it somewhere else!

950
01:18:57,599 --> 01:19:00,193
-Look. Listen, my daddy's watch.
-Cash.

951
01:19:00,369 --> 01:19:04,567
Here. The letters of his name
instead of numbers, huh?

952
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,298
I'm gonna leave this watch
with you.

953
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:09,376
-Cash.
-Give it to him and get him out of here!

954
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:12,103
Thank you, sir.

955
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,947
I'm much obliged to you, sir.

956
01:19:31,033 --> 01:19:33,194
Will you get this thing going?
Come on, now.

957
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:35,233
-Come on, now, will you?
-Shut up.

958
01:19:35,404 --> 01:19:38,464
We're going as fast as we can.

959
01:19:59,728 --> 01:20:02,128
You all must have done
some mighty fast repairs.

960
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:05,266
-No repairs. Put in a new saw cylinder.
-From where?

961
01:20:05,434 --> 01:20:07,493
Boss and I had one at our place.

962
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:10,934
How come I wasn't let in on this
information before I lit out of here?

963
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:14,075
I just about killed myself getting that.
Where's that wop, Vacarro?

964
01:20:14,243 --> 01:20:17,212
I wanna get some explanation of this.
Vacarro!

965
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:19,012
Where is he?

966
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:21,445
-You seen the boss man, Norm?
-No, sir.

967
01:20:21,617 --> 01:20:23,084
You seen the boss man, Moose?

968
01:20:23,252 --> 01:20:24,947
-No, sir.
-No, sir.

969
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:28,414
Where are my men?

970
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:32,583
Oh, I sent them home.
I mean, they're useless.

971
01:20:33,896 --> 01:20:35,989
Well, you keep operating.

972
01:20:39,535 --> 01:20:43,699
Hey! You know, this isn't a bad old gin.

973
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:21,305
Hey, anybody living here?

974
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:28,047
Anybody still living in this house?

975
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:45,863
It's Archie Lee.

976
01:22:22,838 --> 01:22:24,806
What happened here?

977
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:29,108
-I said, what happened here?
-The plaster broke in the attic.

978
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:32,304
Well, how? How did--?
How'd that happen?

979
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:36,640
How did anything happen?
It just happened.

980
01:22:38,654 --> 01:22:41,885
Ain't I told you
not to slop around here in a slip?

981
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:46,424
Ain't I told you
not to slop around here in a slip?

982
01:22:46,595 --> 01:22:49,428
Supper almost ready now.

983
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:58,762
The breakage alone in that kitchen
would ruin a well-to-do man.

984
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:03,441
Now, you go on up and get some decent
clothes on you. Then come back down here.

985
01:23:03,612 --> 01:23:06,740
You know, there's a new bureau
in Washington, D.C.

986
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:10,146
It's called the UW Bureau.
You know what UW stands for?

987
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:12,913
It stands for "useless women".

988
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:15,522
They got secret plans to put the--

989
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:20,728
To rounding them all up and shoot them.
That's what....

990
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,163
Shoot them.

991
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:25,892
Now, you heard me. I said, shoot them.

992
01:23:26,068 --> 01:23:28,229
How about men that's destructive?

993
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:32,999
Ain't they got some plan to round up
destructive men and shoot them?

994
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:35,507
What destructive men
you talking about?

995
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:39,943
Men that blows things up
and burns things down...

996
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:43,949
...because they're too evil
and too stupid to get along otherwise.

997
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:47,215
Because their competition
is too much for them.

998
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:49,619
So they turn criminal.

999
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:52,749
They do things like arson...

1000
01:23:52,928 --> 01:23:56,455
...the willful destruction
of property by fire.

1001
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:05,962
-Who said that to you?
-Hey, look what's up there on the porch.

1002
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:08,075
Light the light,
there's men on the road.

1003
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:10,609
Never mind, now.
Who said arson to you, huh?

1004
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:13,111
Who spoke of this "willful destruction"?

1005
01:24:13,281 --> 01:24:16,250
Why, you never knew them words.
Who said them to you?

1006
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:18,943
Sometimes, big shot...

1007
01:24:19,121 --> 01:24:22,818
...you don't seem to give me credit
for very much intelligence at all.

1008
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:25,653
I've been to school in my life.

1009
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:28,421
And I'm a magazine reader.

1010
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:37,136
Who gave that whistle?

1011
01:24:37,305 --> 01:24:40,274
Don't you give a wolf whistle
at my wife!

1012
01:24:40,442 --> 01:24:43,377
You just stay on that side
of that fence, do you hear?

1013
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:45,979
Right on that side over there!

1014
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:02,427
Men from the Syndicate Plantation,
white and black mixed.

1015
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:05,293
Headed for Tiger Tail Bayou
with straw gigs and rubber boots on.

1016
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:07,662
I just hope they turn downstream.

1017
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:10,634
I just hope they trespass across
my property. I hope they dare.

1018
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:13,702
I'll blast them out of the bayou
with a shotgun.

1019
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:17,572
-Small dogs have a large bark.
-No one's gonna insult no woman of mine.

1020
01:25:17,879 --> 01:25:20,871
You take a lot for granted
when you say "mine".

1021
01:25:21,049 --> 01:25:24,815
I came to you today for protection.
And what did I get?

1022
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:26,715
Slapped. Sent home.

1023
01:25:27,322 --> 01:25:31,190
Now, I'm telling you
that the agreement between us is over.

1024
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:35,386
You darn tooting it's over.
In just three hours....

1025
01:25:35,564 --> 01:25:38,829
Three hours, the terms of our agreement
will be settled for good.

1026
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,968
-Don't count on it.
-Sharp at midnight.

1027
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:44,936
-Too much has happened here lately.
-Well, my credit is wide open again.

1028
01:25:45,106 --> 01:25:47,506
And so is the jailhouse door
if the truth comes out.

1029
01:25:47,676 --> 01:25:52,409
-Are you threatening me with black--?
-Heigh-ho, Silva!

1030
01:25:56,518 --> 01:26:01,615
Archie Lee, Mr. Vacarro says that
he might not put up a new cotton gin...

1031
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:04,486
...but might let you gin out his cotton
for him all the time.

1032
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,593
Ain't you pleased about that?

1033
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:09,558
He's gonna come tomorrow
with lots more cotton.

1034
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:12,723
And while you're ginning it out,
he's gonna have me entertain him.

1035
01:26:13,335 --> 01:26:15,599
Make lemonade for him.

1036
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:19,906
And it's gonna go on and on,
maybe even till next fall.

1037
01:26:21,877 --> 01:26:25,074
It's the good-neighbor policy in practice.

1038
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:35,547
How long you been on the place?

1039
01:26:35,724 --> 01:26:40,684
All this unusually long fall afternoon
I've imposed on your hospitality.

1040
01:26:45,934 --> 01:26:50,598
-Where you been here?
-Taking a nap on your only remaining bed.

1041
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:54,173
The crib in the nursery
with the slats let down.

1042
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:56,902
Something sad about it,
know what I mean?

1043
01:26:57,078 --> 01:26:58,477
Sad about what?

1044
01:26:58,647 --> 01:27:01,514
An unoccupied nursery in the house...

1045
01:27:01,683 --> 01:27:04,345
...and all other rooms empty.

1046
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:07,988
That's no problem of yours.

1047
01:27:08,156 --> 01:27:11,922
A good-neighbor policy
makes your problems mine and vice versa.

1048
01:27:12,494 --> 01:27:14,621
Supper ready, children.

1049
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:18,630
Well, didn't you all hear us
called in to supper?

1050
01:27:21,036 --> 01:27:22,833
You gonna eat here tonight?

1051
01:27:23,004 --> 01:27:25,564
Mrs. Meighan asked me
to stay for supper.

1052
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:29,699
But I told her I better get to hear
the invitation from the head of the house...

1053
01:27:29,878 --> 01:27:32,506
...before I'd feel free to accept it.

1054
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:34,911
So, what do you say?

1055
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:42,016
Stay for supper.

1056
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:47,457
-Well, you'll have to take potluck.
-I wouldn't be putting you out?

1057
01:27:50,432 --> 01:27:53,367
Excuse me, I better get into my clothes.

1058
01:27:53,535 --> 01:27:57,164
Oh, yeah. You better.

1059
01:28:41,783 --> 01:28:44,843
Did I understand you to say that....

1060
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:46,282
That...

1061
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:51,517
...you wouldn't build a new gin
but would leave your business to me?

1062
01:28:51,693 --> 01:28:54,992
-If that's agreeable with you.
-I don't know about that.

1063
01:28:57,866 --> 01:29:00,266
Well, I gotta consider the matter.

1064
01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:02,960
Financing is involved.

1065
01:29:03,138 --> 01:29:07,370
Such as new equipment and....

1066
01:29:08,777 --> 01:29:10,711
Let's go in and eat now.

1067
01:29:11,713 --> 01:29:15,444
I got a pain in the belly.
I got a sort of...

1068
01:29:15,617 --> 01:29:17,312
...heartburn.

1069
01:29:21,089 --> 01:29:22,647
Hey.

1070
01:29:22,824 --> 01:29:26,260
Hey, one more place at the table.

1071
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:29,521
Mr. Vacarro from the Syndicate Plantation
is staying for supper.

1072
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:33,896
I had no idea company was expected.
Just let me change--

1073
01:29:34,069 --> 01:29:37,368
Another place is all that's called for.

1074
01:29:41,643 --> 01:29:43,372
Have you been here all day?

1075
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:46,514
Have you been in the house
or did you ride out to the hospital...

1076
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:50,378
-...and eat some more chocolate candy?
-I visited a friend in the hospital.

1077
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:52,747
Then you were out while I--

1078
01:29:53,188 --> 01:29:55,315
I worked like the hammers of hell!

1079
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:57,685
I come home,
the attic floor has fell through...

1080
01:29:57,859 --> 01:30:00,953
...my wife's bad-tempered and insulting
and a supper of hog slops!

1081
01:30:01,129 --> 01:30:03,461
I suppose you've got--

1082
01:30:06,101 --> 01:30:09,798
Sit down. I've gotta make me
a phone call.

1083
01:30:17,479 --> 01:30:18,707
Hello.

1084
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,747
I want the Bright Spot, Miss Hopkins.
Give me the Bright Spot.

1085
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:25,417
I can't think of the number now.
You give it to me, you hear?

1086
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:32,021
Hello, Bright Spot.

1087
01:30:34,662 --> 01:30:37,392
He's on the phone about something.
If I was you, I wouldn't hang around.

1088
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:41,729
I got the ace of spades in my pocket
and I'm gonna get his autograph on it too.

1089
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:43,164
Don't count on the law court.

1090
01:30:43,338 --> 01:30:45,067
Justice here is deaf and blind
as that woman.

1091
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,299
I do my own justice.

1092
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:52,205
Get Eddie, Beetle, Boots, Rhodes,
any one of them.

1093
01:30:52,747 --> 01:30:55,238
I'm advising you,
go while he's on the phone.

1094
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:57,441
You don't know his friends.

1095
01:30:57,619 --> 01:31:00,110
-They're rough.
-I've seen them.

1096
01:31:01,523 --> 01:31:05,118
I find you different this evening
in some way.

1097
01:31:06,327 --> 01:31:08,158
Never mind that.

1098
01:31:08,329 --> 01:31:10,263
Just go while he's still
on the phone.

1099
01:31:10,431 --> 01:31:12,626
Grown up suddenly.

1100
01:31:17,739 --> 01:31:21,675
I feel cool and rested
for the first time in my life.

1101
01:31:23,278 --> 01:31:25,178
That's the way I feel.

1102
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:28,647
Rested and cool.

1103
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:31,978
And there's no place
he can run to in this county.

1104
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:35,018
Well, you can say that again, boy.

1105
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:06,844
You can't leave the place,
well, then you send someone.

1106
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:09,683
But you send someone to find him,
you hear me?

1107
01:32:12,126 --> 01:32:13,787
I'll call you--

1108
01:32:14,429 --> 01:32:17,728
-Poems of nature. If I had--
-Never mind the poems of nature.

1109
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:19,867
Goodbye, I'll call you later.

1110
01:32:21,502 --> 01:32:24,733
-If I had known company was expected--
-Put some food on the table.

1111
01:32:24,906 --> 01:32:26,897
-Just take a minute.
-We ain't gonna wait no minute.

1112
01:32:32,146 --> 01:32:34,239
Bring out some food.

1113
01:32:52,133 --> 01:32:57,696
Is that what they call a Mona Lisa smile
you got on your puss?

1114
01:33:00,208 --> 01:33:05,009
-Put some food on the table!
-Don't pick on Aunt Rose Comfort.

1115
01:33:05,346 --> 01:33:07,906
Gonna have a talk with that old woman
right here tonight.

1116
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:10,482
She's outstayed her welcome.

1117
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:17,782
What a pretty blue ribbon
you're wearing tonight, Mrs. Meighan.

1118
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:20,720
Why, thank you, Mr. Vacarro.

1119
01:33:21,029 --> 01:33:23,759
There's so many shades of blue.

1120
01:33:24,299 --> 01:33:28,167
-What particular shade is that?
-It's just baby blue.

1121
01:33:30,772 --> 01:33:32,831
Brings out the blue of your eyes.

1122
01:33:33,007 --> 01:33:34,907
Food!

1123
01:33:35,376 --> 01:33:39,039
-Food!
-Immediately. This instant.

1124
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:43,307
This sweater was part
of my trousseau.

1125
01:33:43,918 --> 01:33:45,351
I got all my trousseau...

1126
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:49,456
...at various department stores in Memphis
where my daddy was known.

1127
01:33:50,058 --> 01:33:52,219
What is this stuff, grass?

1128
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:55,089
It's greens. Don't you know greens
when you see them?

1129
01:33:55,263 --> 01:33:58,357
Big department stores on Main Street.

1130
01:33:58,733 --> 01:34:02,328
-This stuff is greens?
-Archie Lee dotes on greens.

1131
01:34:02,503 --> 01:34:04,596
-Don't you, Archie Lee?
-No, I don't.

1132
01:34:04,772 --> 01:34:07,605
You don't?
You don't dote on greens?

1133
01:34:07,775 --> 01:34:10,175
-Well, somebody did.
-Somebody probably did.

1134
01:34:10,345 --> 01:34:13,337
Sometime, somewhere,
but that don't mean it was me.

1135
01:34:13,514 --> 01:34:17,507
Eat your greens, big shot.
Greens put iron in the blood.

1136
01:34:17,685 --> 01:34:19,653
I thought Archie Lee doted on greens.

1137
01:34:19,821 --> 01:34:23,484
All these likes and dislikes
are hard to keep straight in your head.

1138
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:27,856
-Archie Lee is easy to cook for.
-Take this slop off the table.

1139
01:34:28,396 --> 01:34:33,197
I'll cook you some eggs Birmingham.
These greens didn't cook enough.

1140
01:34:33,434 --> 01:34:36,301
I played a fool trick with my stove. I....

1141
01:34:36,471 --> 01:34:38,701
I forgot to light it.

1142
01:34:40,441 --> 01:34:43,308
When I went out to the store,
I left my greens on the stove.

1143
01:34:43,478 --> 01:34:45,105
I thought they were boiling.

1144
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:49,079
When I came home,
I discovered my stove wasn't lighted.

1145
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:50,740
Why do you say "my stove"?

1146
01:34:50,918 --> 01:34:54,149
-Why is everything "mine"?
-Archie Lee, I think you've been drinking.

1147
01:34:54,756 --> 01:34:58,157
You stay out of this.
Sit down, Aunt Rose.

1148
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:02,993
-What was that, Archie Lee?
-Sit down.

1149
01:35:03,264 --> 01:35:04,697
Where?

1150
01:35:09,804 --> 01:35:11,271
Sit down.

1151
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,641
I'm gonna ask you a question.

1152
01:35:24,752 --> 01:35:27,243
What sort of plans have you made?

1153
01:35:27,855 --> 01:35:30,688
What plans, Archie Lee?
What sort of plans do you mean?

1154
01:35:30,858 --> 01:35:32,086
Plans for the future.

1155
01:35:32,326 --> 01:35:36,126
Archie Lee, I don't think this discussion
is necessary in front of company.

1156
01:35:36,297 --> 01:35:40,324
Mrs. Meighan, when someone
feels uncomfortable over something...

1157
01:35:40,501 --> 01:35:43,868
...it often happens he takes out
his annoyance...

1158
01:35:44,038 --> 01:35:47,439
...on some completely innocent person.

1159
01:35:58,453 --> 01:35:59,943
Now, Aunt Rose...

1160
01:36:00,655 --> 01:36:04,455
...you've been here since August.
And that's a mighty long stay.

1161
01:36:07,895 --> 01:36:11,262
And it's my honest opinion
that you're in need of a rest.

1162
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:16,165
You've been cooking around here and
cooking around there for how long now?

1163
01:36:17,572 --> 01:36:18,903
Well?

1164
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:22,334
How long you been cooking
around people's houses?

1165
01:36:22,977 --> 01:36:28,643
I helped out my relatives, my folks,
whenever they needed me.

1166
01:36:28,816 --> 01:36:33,082
I was always invited,
sometimes begged to cook.

1167
01:36:33,488 --> 01:36:35,888
When babies was expected
or somebody was sick...

1168
01:36:36,057 --> 01:36:39,925
...they called Aunt Rose.
And Aunt Rose was always ready.

1169
01:36:40,895 --> 01:36:44,763
Nobody ever had to put me out.

1170
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:50,964
Will you gentlemen excuse me
from the dinner table, I....

1171
01:36:53,074 --> 01:36:55,668
I'll run up and pack.

1172
01:37:01,048 --> 01:37:03,881
Miss Rose Comfort, wait.

1173
01:37:06,087 --> 01:37:08,055
I'll drive you home.

1174
01:37:08,222 --> 01:37:11,589
-I don't have nowhere to go.
-Yes, you do.

1175
01:37:11,926 --> 01:37:14,019
I need a cook.

1176
01:37:14,529 --> 01:37:16,258
I'm tired of my own cooking.

1177
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:20,764
And I am anxious to try those
eggs Birmingham you mentioned.

1178
01:37:21,536 --> 01:37:23,231
Is it a deal?

1179
01:37:25,239 --> 01:37:28,231
-Well, I....
-Oh, sure it's a deal, Aunt Rose.

1180
01:37:28,409 --> 01:37:31,242
Mr. Vacarro will be very good to you.

1181
01:37:31,412 --> 01:37:34,643
And you never can tell
about things in the future.

1182
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:40,016
Well, I'm gonna pack my things.

1183
01:37:58,406 --> 01:38:02,502
Is there anything else around here you
wanna take away with you, Mr. Vacarro?

1184
01:38:07,114 --> 01:38:10,606
-Well, is there?
-Why, yes, Archie Lee.

1185
01:38:10,785 --> 01:38:16,087
Mr. Vacarro noticed that the house
was just full of furniture.

1186
01:38:16,424 --> 01:38:20,986
And he'd like to borrow
about five complete sets of it.

1187
01:39:04,138 --> 01:39:07,232
Colored folks call this pot liquor.

1188
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:11,238
I love pot liquor.

1189
01:39:13,614 --> 01:39:15,309
Good?

1190
01:39:16,083 --> 01:39:19,177
I'm crazy about pot liquor.

1191
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:24,651
-Good.
-It's good.

1192
01:39:31,732 --> 01:39:34,360
-Good.
-That's good.

1193
01:39:38,506 --> 01:39:42,465
That old hen was coming in like
she'd been invited to supper.

1194
01:39:52,153 --> 01:39:55,281
You listen to me.
Now, you all listen to me.

1195
01:39:55,456 --> 01:39:56,855
Now, you quit giving those....

1196
01:39:57,024 --> 01:39:59,959
Those looks back and forth
and listen to me.

1197
01:40:00,127 --> 01:40:02,152
Why, you think I'm deaf...

1198
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:05,356
...and dumb and blind or something,
do you?

1199
01:40:05,633 --> 01:40:07,760
Well, you're mistook.

1200
01:40:07,935 --> 01:40:09,402
Oh, brother.

1201
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:12,004
Oh, brother,
but you're much, much mistook.

1202
01:40:12,173 --> 01:40:16,701
I know. I know, I guess I look like a....

1203
01:40:17,378 --> 01:40:19,209
I guess I look like--

1204
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:21,439
What do you guess you look like,
Archie Lee?

1205
01:40:21,615 --> 01:40:24,448
Yeah, some sweet little innocent
Baby Doll of a wife, huh?

1206
01:40:24,618 --> 01:40:28,714
Oh, not ready for marriage, huh?
Oh, no, not ready for marriage...

1207
01:40:28,889 --> 01:40:30,948
...but plenty ready to go out--

1208
01:40:31,125 --> 01:40:33,923
Wait a minute now,
I see how it's funny.

1209
01:40:34,095 --> 01:40:35,653
It sure is funny, isn't it, huh?

1210
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:41,032
But there's one little teensy-weensy
thing that you've overlooked.

1211
01:40:41,302 --> 01:40:43,270
I got position.

1212
01:40:44,605 --> 01:40:47,938
I got position in this county
where I was born and brought up.

1213
01:40:48,109 --> 01:40:51,636
-Stop it!
-I hold a respected position.

1214
01:40:51,812 --> 01:40:55,543
Lifelong member of every organization
in the delta!

1215
01:40:57,084 --> 01:40:59,211
On my side are friends!

1216
01:40:59,387 --> 01:41:01,378
Friends.

1217
01:41:01,555 --> 01:41:05,321
Long-standing business associates,
and social.

1218
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:08,151
You see what I mean, huh?

1219
01:41:08,329 --> 01:41:11,059
You ain't got that advantage,
have you, mister?

1220
01:41:11,232 --> 01:41:13,860
Well, have you, huh? Have you?

1221
01:41:14,034 --> 01:41:15,797
Come on, speak up.

1222
01:41:16,937 --> 01:41:20,202
Ain't you a dago or something?
Excuse me, I mean, Italian or something?

1223
01:41:20,374 --> 01:41:23,343
I was a medical corpsman in the Navy.
You've got an unhealthy look.

1224
01:41:23,511 --> 01:41:26,378
-All I gotta do is get on the phone--
-Call an ambulance.

1225
01:41:26,547 --> 01:41:29,948
I don't have to make a call.
I can handle the situation myself.

1226
01:41:30,117 --> 01:41:34,884
-What situation do you mean?
-Situation I find here under my roof!

1227
01:41:42,129 --> 01:41:43,994
Look here now.

1228
01:41:46,934 --> 01:41:48,265
Oh, I'm not such a--

1229
01:41:48,436 --> 01:41:51,963
Such a marble-missing old fool
that I couldn't size it up.

1230
01:41:54,408 --> 01:41:57,809
I sized it up the minute I seen
you was still on this place...

1231
01:41:57,978 --> 01:41:59,536
...and her....

1232
01:41:59,713 --> 01:42:01,010
Oh, her....

1233
01:42:01,182 --> 01:42:05,482
Her with that sly smile on her.
And you with yours on you.

1234
01:42:05,653 --> 01:42:09,180
-I know how to wipe off those sly smiles.
-Meighan!

1235
01:42:09,657 --> 01:42:13,184
You know and I know and I know
that you know that I know...

1236
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:16,523
...that you set fire to my cotton gin
last night.

1237
01:42:16,697 --> 01:42:19,894
You burned down the Syndicate Gin.

1238
01:42:20,067 --> 01:42:23,662
And I got here in my hand
a signed affidavit...

1239
01:42:23,838 --> 01:42:26,329
...a paper signed by a witness...

1240
01:42:26,507 --> 01:42:31,206
...whose testimony will hold up even in
the law courts of Tiger Tail County.

1241
01:42:31,378 --> 01:42:34,779
That's what I come here for
and that's all I got.

1242
01:42:34,949 --> 01:42:39,909
Whatever else you suspect,
well, you're mistaken.

1243
01:42:40,154 --> 01:42:42,748
Isn't that so, Mrs. Meighan?
Isn't your husband mistaken...

1244
01:42:42,923 --> 01:42:45,790
...in thinking I got anything
but this signed affidavit...

1245
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:49,396
...which was the purpose
of my all-afternoon call?

1246
01:42:50,431 --> 01:42:52,797
I'm foreign, Meighan...

1247
01:42:52,967 --> 01:42:57,301
...but not revengeful,
at least not more than is rightful.

1248
01:42:58,005 --> 01:43:01,236
Now, we got a workable
good-neighbor policy between us.

1249
01:43:01,408 --> 01:43:05,742
It might work out.
Anyhow, I think it deserves a try.

1250
01:43:05,913 --> 01:43:08,973
Now, as to the other side of the situation,
which I won't mention...

1251
01:43:09,149 --> 01:43:13,381
...well, all I can say is
a certain attraction exists.

1252
01:43:13,554 --> 01:43:14,987
Mutually, I believe.

1253
01:43:15,155 --> 01:43:18,488
I needed a little shuteye
after last night's excitement.

1254
01:43:18,659 --> 01:43:23,221
And I have a faint recollection
of being sung to by someone.

1255
01:43:23,831 --> 01:43:26,231
A lullaby song that was sweet...

1256
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:29,369
...and a touch of cool fingers.

1257
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:33,096
-You think I'm gonna put up with this?
-But that's all, absolutely.

1258
01:43:33,274 --> 01:43:36,141
-You think I'm gonna put up--?
-With this situation?

1259
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:39,609
You went to whole lot of risk
and trouble to get my business back.

1260
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:41,042
-Cool.
-Don't you want it?

1261
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:43,513
-Yeah, cool.
-It's up to you, Archie.

1262
01:43:43,684 --> 01:43:46,244
-Very cool.
-It's up to you.

1263
01:43:46,487 --> 01:43:49,149
-You just fixed your wagon.
-Yeah.

1264
01:43:49,423 --> 01:43:53,587
With this smart talk,
oh, you just fixed your wagon.

1265
01:43:53,761 --> 01:43:57,527
I'm gonna wipe that grin off
your greasy wop face for good.

1266
01:43:57,698 --> 01:44:00,394
Oh, you just-- You watch.

1267
01:44:02,036 --> 01:44:05,631
Is my wop face greasy, Mrs. Meighan?

1268
01:44:33,867 --> 01:44:37,894
That's the last time you're ever gonna lay
your hands on me again, you stinker!

1269
01:44:38,305 --> 01:44:40,899
You stinking stinker! Stinker!

1270
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:43,675
Look out, Silva!

1271
01:44:46,413 --> 01:44:47,778
Rock?

1272
01:44:48,282 --> 01:44:49,715
Rock, where are you?

1273
01:44:51,018 --> 01:44:54,078
Where are you, Vacarro?
Where are you?

1274
01:45:01,228 --> 01:45:02,559
Where you hiding, wop?

1275
01:45:02,863 --> 01:45:06,355
Oh, if you're under there,
you ain't getting out.

1276
01:45:13,507 --> 01:45:16,169
Look, my husband's got a gun,
and I just don't know--

1277
01:45:26,887 --> 01:45:28,218
Hey, wop!

1278
01:45:28,389 --> 01:45:30,357
Oh, you yellow-bellied wop.

1279
01:45:39,433 --> 01:45:42,960
Get that gun!
Get that gun away from him!

1280
01:45:52,613 --> 01:45:54,376
Help! Help!

1281
01:45:55,382 --> 01:45:59,284
Where's that wop?
You can't get away!

1282
01:46:04,758 --> 01:46:06,726
Go away from me!

1283
01:46:07,461 --> 01:46:10,988
Get away!
Where are you, Vacarro?

1284
01:46:11,165 --> 01:46:12,632
Right here, neighbor.

1285
01:46:18,372 --> 01:46:20,101
There you are.

1286
01:46:25,779 --> 01:46:28,577
Oh, it's you. Excuse me.

1287
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:31,342
Silva?

1288
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:35,018
Here. Here.

1289
01:46:35,189 --> 01:46:37,589
Where are you, Vacarro?

1290
01:46:38,058 --> 01:46:39,719
Come on.

1291
01:46:40,794 --> 01:46:43,524
You yellow-bellied wop!

1292
01:46:46,366 --> 01:46:48,357
Baby Doll!

1293
01:46:53,307 --> 01:46:55,867
Where are you, Vacarro?

1294
01:46:57,344 --> 01:46:59,835
Where are you, Vacarro?

1295
01:47:01,915 --> 01:47:04,440
Vacarro!

1296
01:47:06,687 --> 01:47:09,349
Come on out, Vacarro!

1297
01:47:10,357 --> 01:47:12,848
Now, you put that gun of yours away!

1298
01:47:33,013 --> 01:47:35,641
Baby Doll!

1299
01:47:35,816 --> 01:47:37,477
Baby.

1300
01:47:39,019 --> 01:47:42,455
Baby Doll.

1301
01:47:42,623 --> 01:47:44,887
Baby Doll.

1302
01:47:46,493 --> 01:47:49,223
Baby Doll.

1303
01:47:49,763 --> 01:47:51,993
Baby Doll.

1304
01:47:58,505 --> 01:48:01,474
Oh, Vacarro, where...?

1305
01:48:01,809 --> 01:48:05,301
Where are you, you wop?

1306
01:48:14,855 --> 01:48:16,823
Baby Doll.

1307
01:48:21,829 --> 01:48:25,094
No. No.

1308
01:48:25,833 --> 01:48:28,131
No, Baby Doll.

1309
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:34,767
Baby Doll. No, no, no.

1310
01:48:36,376 --> 01:48:39,675
No, no, no.

1311
01:48:48,222 --> 01:48:51,555
No. No, no, no.

1312
01:48:55,696 --> 01:48:57,721
Baby Doll.

1313
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:16,313
Hurry. All ready to go.

1314
01:49:19,953 --> 01:49:21,853
Now, who is that?

1315
01:49:22,623 --> 01:49:24,614
What's the matter, Sandy?
Is something wrong?

1316
01:49:24,791 --> 01:49:29,091
I'm running for town marshal
for the 25th term, and I want your vote.

1317
01:49:29,263 --> 01:49:33,757
-You got my vote, Sandy.
-Let me see your gun, fella. Let me see it.

1318
01:49:34,701 --> 01:49:37,602
Doggone, man.
You're too old for a job like that.

1319
01:49:37,771 --> 01:49:41,639
I'm 20 years younger than you
and I wouldn't run for a job like that.

1320
01:49:41,808 --> 01:49:43,571
Age is a factor calls for recognition.

1321
01:49:43,744 --> 01:49:46,577
I hope you recognize the fact
it calls for recognition.

1322
01:49:46,747 --> 01:49:48,339
You know...

1323
01:49:48,849 --> 01:49:50,646
...a man grows old suddenly.

1324
01:49:50,817 --> 01:49:54,913
Not gradual, just all of a sudden
he's old.

1325
01:49:56,023 --> 01:49:58,685
Hey, now, wait a minute,
where you guys taking me?

1326
01:49:58,859 --> 01:50:00,827
You're acting as though
I'm under arrest.

1327
01:50:00,994 --> 01:50:03,428
-Well, you been shoot--
-There he is!

1328
01:50:05,799 --> 01:50:07,994
Come on! Come on!

1329
01:50:08,168 --> 01:50:10,602
Get off! Get off me!

1330
01:50:11,271 --> 01:50:14,035
Come on. Come on.

1331
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:21,907
Hey, how about me?

1332
01:50:22,349 --> 01:50:24,112
Put the handcuffs on him.

1333
01:50:24,985 --> 01:50:27,476
Okay. Okay.

1334
01:50:27,654 --> 01:50:30,748
Put me in that stinking black calaboose.
I ain't a white man?

1335
01:50:30,924 --> 01:50:33,984
No, I ain't a white man,
so throw me in.

1336
01:50:34,161 --> 01:50:36,356
But don't you leave
my Baby Doll here with him.

1337
01:50:36,730 --> 01:50:38,630
Don't you leave him here with her.

1338
01:50:38,799 --> 01:50:40,027
Sandy...

1339
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:42,395
...listen, you're a married man.

1340
01:50:42,569 --> 01:50:45,834
You understand how I feel,
don't you, Sandy?

1341
01:50:46,006 --> 01:50:49,533
Please, as one white man to another.

1342
01:50:49,876 --> 01:50:53,403
Just for tonight,
don't leave him on the place.

1343
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:55,275
Just tonight, Sandy.

1344
01:50:59,453 --> 01:51:01,921
Scratched my leg
on the bark of that tree.

1345
01:51:02,389 --> 01:51:05,688
-Vacarro, come here.
-Excuse me.

1346
01:51:07,995 --> 01:51:09,622
Now, what you got on your mind?

1347
01:51:09,796 --> 01:51:13,357
Listen, fella, we ain't got nothing
to hold that old boy on.

1348
01:51:13,533 --> 01:51:17,401
He's been shooting up his yard. But he tells
us a varmint's been catching his chickens.

1349
01:51:17,571 --> 01:51:18,799
His chickens?

1350
01:51:18,972 --> 01:51:22,635
I got a signed confession by a material
witness that amounts to an affidavit.

1351
01:51:22,809 --> 01:51:24,936
-Let's see.
-Not till it's witnessed by others.

1352
01:51:25,112 --> 01:51:26,409
We'll have it witnessed.

1353
01:51:26,580 --> 01:51:30,482
I don't need or want anything from you.
I'm going to the county sheriff.

1354
01:51:31,051 --> 01:51:34,714
-Rock!
-Here, Silva, here.

1355
01:51:36,490 --> 01:51:40,859
-Hey, Silva, how about me?
-Now?

1356
01:51:43,363 --> 01:51:47,060
Well, I'll be coming back tomorrow
with lots more cotton.

1357
01:51:48,235 --> 01:51:50,430
I'll be back tomorrow
with lots more cotton!

1358
01:51:50,604 --> 01:51:53,573
I'll be back tomorrow
with lots more cotton to gin.

1359
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:55,640
Early in the morning
with lots more cotton.

1360
01:51:56,176 --> 01:51:59,270
Early in the morning
with lots more cotton.

1361
01:52:05,085 --> 01:52:07,781
-Well, he's gone.
-What happens now?

1362
01:52:07,954 --> 01:52:11,685
Well, he sure enough got hisself
a signed confession from your wife.

1363
01:52:11,858 --> 01:52:14,759
We're gonna have to go through this thing
for appearance's sake.

1364
01:52:15,062 --> 01:52:17,326
I don't mean that, I mean...

1365
01:52:20,734 --> 01:52:22,759
...what happens tomorrow?

1366
01:52:23,670 --> 01:52:27,606
Well, the town marshal has no control
over tomorrow.

1367
01:52:50,363 --> 01:52:52,991
Today's my Baby Doll's birthday.

1368
01:53:00,707 --> 01:53:02,971
Your friend forgot me.

1369
01:53:05,812 --> 01:53:10,272
Well, Archie Lee,
it looks like the celebration is over.

1370
01:53:10,450 --> 01:53:12,008
Let's go.

1371
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:16,555
He's coming back tomorrow
with more cotton.

1372
01:53:16,723 --> 01:53:18,782
He's coming back?

1373
01:53:37,077 --> 01:53:39,375
Well, let's go in now.

1374
01:53:41,448 --> 01:53:45,441
We got nothing to do
but wait for tomorrow.

1375
01:53:46,386 --> 01:53:48,149
And see...

1376
01:53:48,622 --> 01:53:52,888
...if we're remembered
or forgotten.

1377
01:54:09,576 --> 01:54:12,568
Oh, my. Oh, my.
