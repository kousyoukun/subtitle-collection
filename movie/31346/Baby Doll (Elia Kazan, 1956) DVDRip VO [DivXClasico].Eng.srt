1
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,985
- Paul Weevo.
- Yes, sir.

2
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,650
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, sir, Mr. Archie.

3
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:43,195
- Can you find the holes?
- Yes, sir, lots of them.

4
00:01:43,365 --> 00:01:46,528
- Well, make sure you get the big ones.
- Yes, sir.

5
00:01:56,778 --> 00:02:00,179
- Uncle Pleasant, ain't you got nothing to do?
- Not a thing.

6
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,815
- Ain't you going to help him?
- I'm retired.

7
00:02:14,997 --> 00:02:16,521
Baby Doll.

8
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:50,751
Archie Lee, you're a mess.

9
00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:52,959
Do you know what they call such people?

10
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,189
Peeping Toms!

11
00:03:57,768 --> 00:04:00,635
Hey, there's no need for a woman
that sleeps in a baby's crib...

12
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:02,169
...to stay away from her husband.

13
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:04,864
I'm gonna plug up the hole
in that wall with chewing gum.

14
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:08,738
If I ever catch you poking a knife
through it again to peek at me in my sleep...

15
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:10,777
...I'm moving in
to the Kotton King Hotel.

16
00:04:10,947 --> 00:04:15,179
And would you please
keep your filthy old dogs off my furniture.

17
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,320
Let me talk to you.

18
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:20,547
- I wanna talk with you.
- Spare your breath.

19
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:23,784
Save it to drum up some business
for your broken-down cotton gin.

20
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,589
- Never mind...
- Close the door so I can get into my clothes.

21
00:04:26,764 --> 00:04:27,890
Get in your clothes.

22
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:31,364
Not till you get on the other side
of that door and close it between us.

23
00:04:31,536 --> 00:04:34,471
Today is the fifth day of November,
tomorrow is the sixth day...

24
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,698
...and the day after that
is November seventh.

25
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:39,138
And you know what day that is,
don't you?

26
00:04:39,477 --> 00:04:42,878
November seventh is your 20th birthday.

27
00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:47,381
Ain't that sweet of you to remember.
Where's my birthday present?

28
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:50,077
Oh, you'll get your birthday present.

29
00:04:50,254 --> 00:04:53,314
Providing you haven't forgotten
the agreement between us...

30
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:56,016
...which comes due on that day.

31
00:04:57,728 --> 00:05:01,357
- Oh, the agreement?
- Yeah, the agreement.

32
00:05:01,532 --> 00:05:04,831
- Which you swore on a Bible to keep.
- Providing you kept yours.

33
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:08,870
- Have I touched you since we were married?
- Yeah, often. And got slapped.

34
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,204
Have I? Have I ever...?
Ever once forced myself on you...

35
00:05:13,377 --> 00:05:15,641
...as your husband by law?

36
00:05:15,813 --> 00:05:17,872
But don't the law mean nothing to you.

37
00:05:18,049 --> 00:05:19,983
How about your side of the agreement?

38
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:23,951
You talked big, mighty big
when you was courting me, big shot.

39
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:28,057
You told my daddy you was gonna put me
in the grandest house in the county.

40
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:31,457
I put you in Tiger Tail.
I bought it and I put you in it.

41
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:34,155
And Tiger Tail is the grandest house
in the county.

42
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:38,235
Yeah, you put me in Tiger Tail, the biggest
old wreck of a place in the whole delta.

43
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:40,667
You told my daddy
you was gonna restore this place.

44
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:43,501
Exactly like it was when
the Dobines owned it, only better.

45
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:47,111
"Make a show place," you said.
Yeah, a freak show.

46
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,840
I've got a boy on the roof right now.
I got my man on the roof right now.

47
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:53,280
- Can't you hear the hammer?
- Is that a hammer?

48
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:55,443
Why, I thought that was
a king-sized termite.

49
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,454
Doggone, if you ain't
the most ungrateful little...

50
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,789
I have mortgaged myself
to satisfy your demands.

51
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,397
You told a mouthful of lies to my daddy
in order to get me.

52
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:09,898
Get you? I ain't got you yet.

53
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,169
No, and you ain't about to either.

54
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:16,205
Now, I'm telling you that if the Ideal
Pay As You Go Plan Furniture Company...

55
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,708
...removes those five complete sets
of furniture from this house...

56
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:23,541
...then that agreement you just spoke about
is automatically canceled.

57
00:06:23,715 --> 00:06:27,412
And now, would you kindly go back
in your own room?

58
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,279
I'm gonna get me a good-paying job
while I'm in town today.

59
00:06:32,457 --> 00:06:34,049
Just in case.

60
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:36,624
Just in case.

61
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:51,667
Admiring yourself in the mirror.
Yeah, just look at yourself.

62
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:56,178
You're not exactly a young girl's
dream come true, Archie Lee Meighan.

63
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,477
<i>There was an old witch
Named Granny Crow</i>

64
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:03,588
<i>Wherever she spit
No grass would grow</i>

65
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:09,259
That old witch must've spit right
on the top of your head, Archie Lee.

66
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,458
Thank you. Thank you.

67
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,001
You're not a woman.

68
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,732
You're a woman not grown,
therefore I make allowances.

69
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:27,202
Aunt Rose Comfort screams
every time that phone rings.

70
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,938
Why does she do a fool thing
like that?

71
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,845
She says phone-ringing scares her.

72
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,145
Aunt Rose,
why don't you answer the phone?

73
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,416
- Aunt Rose?
- My word...

74
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,460
Aunt Rose?

75
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,434
Aunt Rose Comfort!

76
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:52,401
Aunt Rose Comfort!
Why don't you answer that?

77
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:56,134
I can't catch my breath, Archie Lee,
phone give me such a fright.

78
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,141
Answer it.

79
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:03,009
Hello? This is Miss Rose Comfort
McCorkle speaking.

80
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:07,018
No. The lady of the house
is Mrs. Archie Lee Meighan...

81
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,087
...daughter of my brother
who passed away.

82
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:12,054
They don't wanna know that.
Who is it? What do they want?

83
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:15,855
I don't hear very well,
would you please speak a little louder?

84
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:22,030
- Oh, the Ideal Pay As You Go Plan.
- Give me that phone.

85
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:26,239
Now, what is this, boy?

86
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:27,738
Yeah.

87
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:32,238
Today? Oh, no, you gotta give me
a little more time.

88
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:35,348
Well, you see, I've had a little setback
in business lately.

89
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:39,714
The Syndicate Plantation built their own
cotton gin and I've lost their trade.

90
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:43,948
Well, it's gonna take me a little more time
to recover from that.

91
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:46,924
Then take it out.

92
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,119
Take it out! Out! Out!

93
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:52,754
You're never gonna get my business again!
No, never.

94
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:03,239
Archie Lee, you all aren't gonna
lose your fine furniture...

95
00:09:03,411 --> 00:09:05,936
Will you shut up
and get on back in that kitchen.

96
00:09:06,114 --> 00:09:09,811
Don't you speak a word that you heard,
if you heard a word, to my wife.

97
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:14,114
Don't holler no more in this house.
Don't cackle no more.

98
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:16,351
I guarantee, I'll pack you up.

99
00:09:16,524 --> 00:09:20,051
I'll pack you up and haul you off
to that county home at Sunset.

100
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:23,322
What did you say, Archie Lee?
Did you say something to me, Archie Lee?

101
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:27,059
Yeah. I said, shoot!

102
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:36,973
What made her holler this time?

103
00:09:37,145 --> 00:09:39,978
How do I know what made
that old woman holler this time...

104
00:09:40,148 --> 00:09:42,173
...the last time or the next time
she hollers.

105
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,683
Last time she hollered was because
you throwed something at her.

106
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:47,788
What I ever throw
at Aunt Rose Comfort?

107
00:09:47,956 --> 00:09:51,619
A glass of water. And for singing
church hymns in the kitchen.

108
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:53,124
Water?

109
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:56,161
Why, this much water,
I barely sprinkled her with it.

110
00:09:56,331 --> 00:09:59,061
- Well, she don't hear nothing.
- I know.

111
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,668
Well, you gotta do something to get
the old woman's attention, don't you?

112
00:10:02,838 --> 00:10:04,203
Yeah.

113
00:10:04,807 --> 00:10:06,832
Hey, hey. Put me down!

114
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:08,567
Get your...

115
00:10:10,546 --> 00:10:14,312
Get your hands off me!
Take them off!

116
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:19,445
I'm...

117
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,481
I'm gonna...

118
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:23,887
I'm moving to the Kotton King Hotel...

119
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:26,926
...the very next time
you try to break our agreement.

120
00:10:27,096 --> 00:10:29,656
The very next time.

121
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:42,206
Baby Doll!

122
00:10:47,082 --> 00:10:49,050
Baby Doll!

123
00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:58,482
You come on down here
if you're going into town with me.

124
00:10:58,661 --> 00:11:01,494
I gotta be at the doctor's
10 minutes ago.

125
00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:19,042
Baby Doll!

126
00:11:20,116 --> 00:11:22,710
If you're so impatient,
just go ahead without me.

127
00:11:22,886 --> 00:11:27,255
Just go ahead. I've got plenty of ways
of getting downtown without you.

128
00:11:27,424 --> 00:11:29,085
That's the truth.

129
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:37,366
You come on!

130
00:11:50,747 --> 00:11:53,545
You get your cotton-picking tail
down here.

131
00:12:04,527 --> 00:12:06,427
Take your time.

132
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:14,501
- Morning, Sam.
- Ma'am.

133
00:12:19,944 --> 00:12:21,673
Well, what are you waiting for?

134
00:12:22,813 --> 00:12:26,112
Oh, now, come on, get into the car.

135
00:12:26,284 --> 00:12:30,243
I will get in the back seat of that boat
when you get out and walk around...

136
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:33,219
...and open the door for me
like a gentleman.

137
00:12:33,391 --> 00:12:36,952
Well, you're gonna wait a long time
if that's what you're waiting for.

138
00:12:37,128 --> 00:12:40,689
Well, I declare.
My father would turn over in his grave.

139
00:12:40,865 --> 00:12:43,959
I never saw your father get out
and open the car door for any woman...

140
00:12:44,135 --> 00:12:48,265
...especially not your
waddle-legged mother. Now, get on in!

141
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:07,286
Hey, Sid!

142
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:12,421
- Hey, Sid, come here.
- What are we stopping here for?

143
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:16,464
- What are you doing here?
- Vacarro's got me working for him now.

144
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:19,603
- For him? You're working for him?
- What else could I do?

145
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,933
- Syndicate shut my gin down tight.
- What's going on?

146
00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:25,338
Oh, it's a party,
a celebration of some kind.

147
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,478
Why shouldn't the Syndicate celebrate?

148
00:13:27,646 --> 00:13:30,376
It's got every last bit of business
in the county.

149
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:34,612
Including every bit of what I used to get
and every bit of what you used to get.

150
00:13:34,786 --> 00:13:38,916
He's got an up-to-date gin,
not like that old pile of junk you got.

151
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:41,791
When are we getting out of here?

152
00:14:06,718 --> 00:14:09,050
Would you mind moving your arm?

153
00:14:12,157 --> 00:14:14,455
Happy anniversary.

154
00:14:24,703 --> 00:14:26,568
She sure growed up.

155
00:14:26,838 --> 00:14:30,865
I am just as fond of Aunt Rose Comfort as
you are, but I'm in no position to feed and...

156
00:14:31,043 --> 00:14:32,272
Now, look here, big shot.

157
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:36,211
The day Aunt Rose Comfort is unwelcome
under your roof, her and me is moving out.

158
00:14:36,382 --> 00:14:37,610
Well, she can't cook...

159
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:40,912
If you don't like Aunt Rose's cooking,
get me a regular servant.

160
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:44,284
You don't think that I am gonna cook
for a big, fat, old thing like you.

161
00:14:44,457 --> 00:14:47,620
- Quit saying "fat, old thing".
- Get young and thin and I'll quit.

162
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,989
All right, but I am serving you notice.

163
00:14:50,163 --> 00:14:54,122
If that old woman dies on my place, I ain't
gonna get stuck with the funeral expenses.

164
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,996
I'll have her burned up.
"Cremated" is what they call it.

165
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,297
I'll pack her ashes
in an old Coca-Cola bottle...

166
00:14:59,472 --> 00:15:01,770
...and I'll pitch that bottle
into Tiger Tail Bayou.

167
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:04,432
Mr. Meighan, you are late
for your appointment.

168
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,875
The doctor's gonna see you anyway,
I don't know why.

169
00:15:18,524 --> 00:15:20,014
Oh, hey.

170
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:22,617
Well, hi.

171
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:26,731
- Are you the dentist?
- Yes, ma'am. I'm the dentist.

172
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,534
Well, I was scouting around for a job
and I noticed your sign.

173
00:15:31,704 --> 00:15:33,604
And I thought I might help you out.

174
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,305
What are you doing, John?

175
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:43,243
There was a fellow in here just a little
while ago beat me at playing checkers.

176
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:45,783
And I still can't figure out why.

177
00:15:45,953 --> 00:15:47,386
Well...

178
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:50,782
What do you do? Can you type?

179
00:15:52,893 --> 00:15:56,829
No. No, I don't do no typing.
But...

180
00:15:57,397 --> 00:15:59,695
...well, I print a real good hand.

181
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:03,327
I don't know whether
we can use that, though.

182
00:16:05,906 --> 00:16:08,636
You're awful young to be a dentist.

183
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:12,736
Yeah, I'm just getting started.

184
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:17,544
Well, what's the matter with you?

185
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,378
- I haven't been myself, John.
- In what way?

186
00:16:28,762 --> 00:16:31,560
Well, you know, Archie Lee,
you're not an old man...

187
00:16:31,732 --> 00:16:33,757
...but you're not a young man
neither no more.

188
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:35,959
That's the truth, John. That's no lie.

189
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:39,299
- How long you been married now?
- Just about a year now.

190
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:41,540
Well...

191
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:46,536
- She's pretty, though.
- Yeah, I guess so.

192
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,708
Youth, huh?

193
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:53,644
You've been under some strain,
ain't you?

194
00:16:53,821 --> 00:16:56,415
No. No strain at all.

195
00:16:56,591 --> 00:17:00,322
- You look mighty nervous to me.
- I'm not nervous...

196
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:12,936
Well, you'd have to know typing.

197
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,470
It's typing.

198
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,004
- Awfully nice talking to you.
- Yes, ma'am.

199
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:28,012
Mr. Meighan, come back in here.
The doctor's gonna give you a prescription.

200
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:34,117
Archie Lee, all I think you need is
some kind of a little harmless sedative.

201
00:17:34,295 --> 00:17:36,820
You take this down to old man Hogan,
tell him to fill it.

202
00:17:36,998 --> 00:17:39,762
- Take it according to directions.
- Here you are.

203
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,299
Don't forget your sweater.

204
00:17:41,469 --> 00:17:44,495
It's not gonna help
what's wrong with you one bit.

205
00:17:49,177 --> 00:17:50,701
- How doing?
- He knows what he's doing.

206
00:17:50,878 --> 00:17:55,976
I'm ready to go now. I spent just about
the whole day sitting on Main Street.

207
00:18:00,022 --> 00:18:02,752
Why didn't you bring me a double dip?

208
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:06,226
- How long we gonna sit here?
- I gotta wait for my prescription.

209
00:18:06,395 --> 00:18:09,660
- I'm bored.
- Now, what the sam hill is so funny?

210
00:18:15,371 --> 00:18:17,100
Even the Chinamen.

211
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:20,035
You know, people know
the situation between us.

212
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:23,076
Yesterday on Front Street,
a man called out to me and said:

213
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:26,180
"Hey, Archie Lee, has your wife
outgrowed the crib yet?"

214
00:18:26,415 --> 00:18:28,349
Three or four others ha-ha'ed at me.

215
00:18:29,051 --> 00:18:32,248
Public humiliation.

216
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:35,822
Private humiliation is just as painful.

217
00:18:37,426 --> 00:18:42,523
There's no torture on Earth to equal
the torture a cold woman inflicts on a man.

218
00:18:42,698 --> 00:18:45,189
There's no torture to compare with it.

219
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:47,296
I've staked out a lot in hell.

220
00:18:47,469 --> 00:18:51,530
A lot with a rotten house on it and
five complete sets of furniture not paid for.

221
00:18:51,707 --> 00:18:55,006
What you done is bit off more
than you could chew.

222
00:19:00,816 --> 00:19:06,255
- Archie Lee, is that our furniture?
- No, no. No, it isn't. No.

223
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:11,656
They're taking away our stuff!
Why are you just standing there?

224
00:19:11,828 --> 00:19:13,693
I gotta wait for my prescription.

225
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:16,388
- Your prescription? Mr. Hannum!
- Look out now.

226
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:19,558
- Come here!
- Wait!

227
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:23,763
Let's get on home before they get
the rest of it. I'm going. Don't you...

228
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,274
- Baby Doll!
- Don't you dare take my furniture!

229
00:19:28,845 --> 00:19:31,678
- You best go get her.
- Yeah, I guess I better.

230
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,809
- What would you do?
- Get tough on her.

231
00:19:35,985 --> 00:19:39,011
Yeah, easy to say. Come on.

232
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:49,230
Look out, here comes trouble.

233
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:54,167
- What we do about those people?
- Just keep loading the truck.

234
00:19:54,337 --> 00:19:56,965
Get out of my chair!
Go on, get out!

235
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,904
- They have all my furniture.
- Baby Doll, honey.

236
00:20:00,076 --> 00:20:04,172
- Are you crazy, that's my mama's lamp.
- Honey. Honey!

237
00:20:04,347 --> 00:20:06,747
She better not hit me again.

238
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:10,216
- Hey, you put that back!
- Better not hit me.

239
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:22,527
I thought I heard something
rattling around in there.

240
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:33,903
- Baby Doll.
- Leave me alone in here.

241
00:20:34,078 --> 00:20:37,639
I don't wanna be in a room with a man
that would make me live with no furniture.

242
00:20:37,815 --> 00:20:39,043
Oh, honey, I...

243
00:20:39,216 --> 00:20:42,083
My daddy would turn over in his grave
if he knew.

244
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:46,587
If your daddy turned in his grave
as often as you say he'd turn in his grave...

245
00:20:46,757 --> 00:20:49,453
...that old man would plow up
the graveyard.

246
00:20:50,428 --> 00:20:51,656
Look at your Aunt Rose.

247
00:20:51,829 --> 00:20:55,993
She's out there picking roses in the yard
just as if nothing at all happened in here.

248
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:58,601
I'm moving to the Kotton King Hotel.

249
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:03,832
I am moving to the Kotton King Hotel!
I'm gonna get me a good-paying job.

250
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:07,307
The manager of the Kotton King Hotel
helped carry my daddy's coffin.

251
00:21:07,478 --> 00:21:08,740
He'll give me work.

252
00:21:08,913 --> 00:21:11,279
What sort of work
do you think you could do?

253
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:13,110
I could curl hair in a beauty parlor.

254
00:21:13,284 --> 00:21:16,515
- Oh, I can see that.
- I reckon that I could be a hostess.

255
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:18,155
Second floor's all clear now.

256
00:21:18,323 --> 00:21:20,723
- Smile at people coming in a place.
- What place?

257
00:21:20,892 --> 00:21:24,055
Any place. I could be a cashier.

258
00:21:24,229 --> 00:21:26,197
Oh, now, you can't count change.

259
00:21:26,364 --> 00:21:31,996
Well, I could pass out menus
or programs or something.

260
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,899
- Say hello to people.
- Oh, now, Baby...

261
00:21:34,072 --> 00:21:36,336
I can say hello.

262
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:38,902
Sign here.

263
00:21:43,014 --> 00:21:45,278
Kotton King, this is Mrs. Meighan.

264
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,886
I wanna reserve a room
for tomorrow morning.

265
00:21:49,054 --> 00:21:54,082
I wanna register under my maiden name
which is Baby Doll Carson McCorkle.

266
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:59,060
My daddy was T.C. Carson McCorkle,
who died last summer when I got married.

267
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:03,930
And he was a very close personal friend
of the manager of the Kotton King Hotel.

268
00:22:04,102 --> 00:22:05,467
You know.

269
00:22:06,304 --> 00:22:07,931
What's his name?

270
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:19,012
Archie Lee, look at these flowers.
Poems of nature.

271
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:36,763
When we gonna gin out
some more cotton, Mr. Archie?

272
00:22:53,853 --> 00:22:55,684
Oh, my.

273
00:22:57,223 --> 00:22:58,656
Oh, my.

274
00:23:11,671 --> 00:23:13,901
- Come on!
- Good, I got you.

275
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:18,032
- I bet he don't make $2.
- Yeah, all right.

276
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,838
That's the stoutest brandy water
ever wet my whistle.

277
00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:24,449
It must have come right out
of Tiger Tail Bayou.

278
00:23:24,617 --> 00:23:27,643
Young man? Mr. Vacarro?

279
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,779
A mighty fine party you're throwing
tonight in honor of your first anniversary...

280
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:35,156
...as the manager of
the Syndicate Plantation and Gin.

281
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:38,423
Just a minute there, sonny, hold it down.

282
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,131
I got a little something I ought
to get off my chest.

283
00:23:41,301 --> 00:23:43,201
Don't forget your point.

284
00:23:43,837 --> 00:23:46,601
- Us good neighbors appreciate this...
- Just a second, sir.

285
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:48,565
Gentlemen, an announcement:

286
00:23:48,742 --> 00:23:51,506
There'll be a fish fry Saturday night.

287
00:23:51,678 --> 00:23:56,945
Catfish, hush puppies, dancing.
Bring your ladies.

288
00:23:58,251 --> 00:23:59,718
Oh, you go right on, sir.

289
00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:03,481
I just want you to know that us good
neighbors appreciate your achievement...

290
00:24:03,657 --> 00:24:07,957
...in bringing in the biggest cotton crop
that ever was picked on this blessed soil...

291
00:24:08,128 --> 00:24:09,459
...of Tiger Tail County.

292
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,928
Hey, senator, my old dad once said:

293
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:15,967
"Blessed is he who has nothing to say
and cannot be persuaded to say it".

294
00:24:16,136 --> 00:24:17,831
A couple boys there
don't look happy.

295
00:24:18,005 --> 00:24:21,338
They got no reason to be.
You put them out of business.

296
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:25,542
- Man, they got plenty good liquor yonder.
- I'll drink my own.

297
00:24:30,183 --> 00:24:32,708
Now, when you first came here...

298
00:24:32,886 --> 00:24:36,049
...I admit that us old-timers
were a bit standoffish.

299
00:24:36,223 --> 00:24:39,056
We didn't know you all that well at first.

300
00:24:39,226 --> 00:24:40,455
Naturally.

301
00:24:40,628 --> 00:24:44,086
A thing is profitable to some,
is unprofitable to others.

302
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:48,634
As the fellow says, "One man's meat
is another man's poison".

303
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,369
We all know that some folks here
have suffered financially...

304
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,567
...due in some measure to this man's
success with his Syndicate Plantation.

305
00:24:56,944 --> 00:25:00,710
But as a whole, the community stands
to reap a nice fat profit.

306
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:02,110
Hey, senator...

307
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:06,242
...next time run on a Republican ticket,
we'll get the nigger vote out for you.

308
00:25:10,024 --> 00:25:14,757
- Silva! Mr. Silva!
- Mr. Silva! Mr. Silva!

309
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:19,590
Fire!

310
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:23,300
Mr. Silva! Mr. Silva!

311
00:25:34,415 --> 00:25:39,045
Move the wagons! Move them!
Get that cotton moving!

312
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:47,724
Get that cotton moving!
Get those wagons!

313
00:25:47,896 --> 00:25:51,388
Mr. Silva, where are you?

314
00:26:25,768 --> 00:26:27,861
Kerosene can.

315
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:52,659
Marshal, what you gonna do about
finding the man that burned down my gin?

316
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:55,662
Well, what makes you so sure
your gin was set fire to?

317
00:26:55,832 --> 00:26:57,925
Look around.

318
00:26:58,301 --> 00:27:01,236
Did you ever see so many happy faces?

319
00:27:01,404 --> 00:27:05,067
It looks like a rich man's funeral
with all his relations attending.

320
00:27:05,241 --> 00:27:06,868
I'd hate to have to prove that.

321
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:10,342
I'd hate to have to depend on you
to prove it.

322
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:15,044
I can't honestly imagine.
If it's a case of arson, who done it?

323
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:19,052
Every poor man you put out of business
was right there when the fire broke out.

324
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:21,315
One wasn't. I know one that wasn't.

325
00:27:21,491 --> 00:27:24,119
Naming names that sound suspicious
is risky business.

326
00:27:24,294 --> 00:27:25,693
I didn't name a name.

327
00:27:25,862 --> 00:27:28,422
It looks like whoever did it
forgot to take this with him.

328
00:27:28,598 --> 00:27:33,262
Marshal, as your deputy, I'll take this can
and I'll examine it very carefully.

329
00:27:33,436 --> 00:27:37,372
See if there's any basis for thinking
it's you who started the fire.

330
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,509
I had to run through fire to get this can
and I mean to keep it.

331
00:27:40,677 --> 00:27:42,941
Lock it up in the pickup truck.

332
00:27:55,358 --> 00:27:58,020
Hey, Gina, sing us a song.

333
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:24,815
Hey, what you gonna do about
ginning out the rest of your cotton?

334
00:28:24,989 --> 00:28:27,549
I'll truck it over to Sunset.

335
00:28:28,025 --> 00:28:30,516
Collins will gin it out for me.

336
00:28:31,228 --> 00:28:33,128
Collins got his own cotton to gin,
fella.

337
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:35,458
Then I'll truck it over to Bolivar County.

338
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:38,227
Ain't nobody around here
gonna gin it out for me.

339
00:28:44,909 --> 00:28:46,706
Silva!

340
00:28:51,682 --> 00:28:52,910
Rock?

341
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:56,246
- Give it...
- It's me, Rock.

342
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,411
- He got the can, boss.
- What? Who? Who?

343
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:02,320
I don't know, it was somebody.
Jumped me from the rear.

344
00:29:04,662 --> 00:29:07,256
Just stay back. Stay back.

345
00:29:10,201 --> 00:29:15,867
Boy, take the advice of an old-timer
who was born and raised in this county.

346
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:19,875
Knows every nigger, every hound dog,
every toadstool...

347
00:29:20,045 --> 00:29:22,673
...and every tree stump
for 50 miles around you.

348
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:26,044
My advice is for you not to make
any more reckless charges.

349
00:29:26,217 --> 00:29:29,448
Being a foreigner, you already
got strike one and strike two against you.

350
00:29:29,621 --> 00:29:33,022
I want no advice, no law,
no court in this county.

351
00:29:33,191 --> 00:29:38,823
I come from a country where it's tradition
for each man to make his own justice.

352
00:29:39,164 --> 00:29:45,660
Like bootlegged liquor, private, in secret,
because there was corruption there too.

353
00:29:45,837 --> 00:29:51,173
And if justice was executed,
it was executed by each man himself, alone.

354
00:29:51,576 --> 00:29:56,775
I mean, Biblical justice.
Eye for eye, tooth for tooth.

355
00:29:57,082 --> 00:29:59,016
Let's go, Rock.

356
00:30:18,004 --> 00:30:20,632
Don't notice this, I got to.

357
00:30:20,806 --> 00:30:23,172
I hadn't noticed a thing.

358
00:30:29,749 --> 00:30:31,842
Which one did it, Rock, do you know?

359
00:30:32,018 --> 00:30:34,885
They were all there in the shed,
all except one.

360
00:30:35,054 --> 00:30:37,716
The one that wasn't there,
I figure he did it.

361
00:30:41,227 --> 00:30:44,287
Well, he's the one that's gonna gin
out my cotton.

362
00:31:11,524 --> 00:31:12,752
Get her up.

363
00:31:20,433 --> 00:31:22,492
The furniture's coming back today.

364
00:31:22,668 --> 00:31:25,763
- Have mercy.
- Come on, get, get.

365
00:31:34,247 --> 00:31:35,737
Don't say a word.

366
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:39,613
A little bird told me you'd be bringing
those wagons of cotton to my door.

367
00:31:39,786 --> 00:31:42,346
I want you to know
that you're a very lucky fella.

368
00:31:42,522 --> 00:31:44,649
- How come?
- I mean, that I am in a position...

369
00:31:44,825 --> 00:31:47,851
...to hold back the other orders
and give you a priority.

370
00:31:48,028 --> 00:31:50,724
Come on. Get out of that truck
and have some coffee with me.

371
00:31:50,897 --> 00:31:53,661
- What's your price?
- You remember my price. It hasn't changed.

372
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:57,634
- Equipment hasn't changed either?
- A-1 shape. You ought to remember that.

373
00:31:57,804 --> 00:32:00,102
I remember you needed a new saw.
You got one?

374
00:32:00,273 --> 00:32:03,538
Well, I can't find one on the market
to equal the old one yet.

375
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:07,510
Come on. Have some coffee with me.
We're all ready for you.

376
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:11,873
I guess when you saw my gin burning
down last night, you must've figured...

377
00:32:12,052 --> 00:32:15,283
...you might get a good deal of business
thrown your way in the morning.

378
00:32:15,455 --> 00:32:17,446
You wanna know something?

379
00:32:17,724 --> 00:32:21,091
I'm always glad to know something
when there's something to know.

380
00:32:21,261 --> 00:32:25,459
I never did see that fire of yours
last night. No, sir.

381
00:32:25,632 --> 00:32:26,860
No, sir. Come on.

382
00:32:27,033 --> 00:32:29,024
Come on in my house,
have some coffee with me.

383
00:32:29,202 --> 00:32:32,695
You, you come too. Come on.
Come on, man.

384
00:32:32,907 --> 00:32:35,637
No, sir. I never did see
that fire of yours last night.

385
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:38,904
We hit the sack after supper
and I didn't know until breakfast...

386
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,513
...your cotton gin burned down.

387
00:32:40,681 --> 00:32:43,445
Oh, Baby Doll? Come out here.
Come here. Come here, Baby Doll.

388
00:32:43,618 --> 00:32:47,281
I want you to come over here and meet
Mr. Vacarro from the Syndicate Plantation.

389
00:32:47,455 --> 00:32:49,423
- What's your first name, Vacarro?
- Silva.

390
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,787
- How do you spell it?
- Capital S-I-L-V-A.

391
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,224
Sure enough? Like a silver lining?

392
00:32:55,396 --> 00:32:58,263
Well, every cloud has got a silver lining.

393
00:32:58,432 --> 00:33:00,525
Oh, what's that from, the Bible?

394
00:33:00,968 --> 00:33:03,630
No, the Mother Goose book.

395
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,405
That name sounds foreign.

396
00:33:07,575 --> 00:33:09,338
It is, Mrs. Meighan.

397
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:12,707
I'm known as the wop that runs
the Syndicate Plantation.

398
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,179
Don't call yourself names.
Let the other folks call you names.

399
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,250
Well, you sure are a lucky fella, Silva.

400
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:21,149
Gold- or even nickel-plated.
Oh, you sure are lucky...

401
00:33:21,322 --> 00:33:23,449
...that I could take a job on
of your size right now.

402
00:33:23,624 --> 00:33:26,889
You're my closest neighbor, and
I believe in the good-neighbor policy.

403
00:33:27,061 --> 00:33:30,189
You do me a good turn
and I do you a good turn, Mr. Vacarro.

404
00:33:30,364 --> 00:33:34,562
Tit for tat and tat for tit
is the policy we live on. Yes, sir.

405
00:33:34,735 --> 00:33:36,635
Aunt Rose? Aunt Rose Comfort!

406
00:33:36,804 --> 00:33:39,398
Oh, Baby Doll. Baby Doll.

407
00:33:39,574 --> 00:33:42,942
Baby, get your daddy's sister to
bring out a pot of coffee for Mr. Vacarro.

408
00:33:43,111 --> 00:33:45,841
- Get her yourself.
- Honey.

409
00:33:46,014 --> 00:33:49,450
Honey. Honey! Honey!

410
00:33:49,618 --> 00:33:52,610
Now, I want you to entertain
this gentleman.

411
00:33:52,788 --> 00:33:56,053
Oh, look. Look, look, look.
Oh, look at her blush. Look.

412
00:33:56,225 --> 00:33:58,887
Look at her blush.
Oh, this is my baby.

413
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:02,428
Oh, this my little girl.
Every precious ounce of her is mine.

414
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:08,261
Aunt Rose? Aunt Rose Comfort!

415
00:34:14,243 --> 00:34:19,442
Excuse my yawn.
But we was up awful late last night.

416
00:34:23,518 --> 00:34:25,145
So you're a wop.

417
00:34:25,854 --> 00:34:29,915
No, I'm a Sicilian, Mrs. Meighan.
A very ancient people.

418
00:34:31,727 --> 00:34:34,287
No, "Sic". Sicilian.

419
00:34:34,463 --> 00:34:36,761
I'm from Corpus Christi.

420
00:34:36,932 --> 00:34:38,832
Oh, how unusual.

421
00:34:39,001 --> 00:34:40,195
Honey!

422
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:44,169
At noon, take Mr. Vacarro to the
Kotton King Hotel for a chicken dinner.

423
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:46,569
Sign my name.

424
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:49,169
It's only when bad luck hits,
Mr. Vacarro...

425
00:34:49,345 --> 00:34:51,870
...you find out who your friends are,
I mean to prove it.

426
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:55,279
Baby Doll, I want you to entertain
this gentleman in the house.

427
00:34:55,451 --> 00:34:58,386
It's a good-neighbor policy,
tit for tat and tat for tit.

428
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,717
You do me a good turn and I do you
a good turn sometime in the future.

429
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,724
That's right. Come on now.
Come on, Baby Doll, come on.

430
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:08,159
Now, make those wagons move now.
Get them rolling.

431
00:35:08,998 --> 00:35:11,296
There ain't nobody comfortable
in that house.

432
00:35:11,467 --> 00:35:14,595
Like if you can find a chair
to sit down on.

433
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:17,872
Do you want coffee?

434
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:21,866
No, just a cool drink of water.
Thank you, ma'am.

435
00:35:22,045 --> 00:35:24,809
Well, the house water runs warm.

436
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:27,745
But if you got the energy to work
that old pump over there...

437
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:31,944
...you could get yourself a nice cool drink
from that there cistern.

438
00:35:32,455 --> 00:35:34,923
I got energy to burn.

439
00:35:50,807 --> 00:35:53,139
Dump their garbage in the yard.

440
00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:55,574
Ignorance and indulgence and stink.

441
00:35:55,746 --> 00:35:57,873
I thought young Mrs. Meighan
smelled pretty good.

442
00:35:58,048 --> 00:36:00,482
You keep your nose to the cotton.

443
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,309
Sometimes water comes,
sometimes it don't.

444
00:36:03,487 --> 00:36:05,921
Well, this time it will.

445
00:36:09,493 --> 00:36:13,020
Bring me a drink
of that nice cool well water, please.

446
00:36:14,498 --> 00:36:17,296
"So you're a wop".

447
00:36:20,571 --> 00:36:23,631
I don't have the strength anymore
in my arm that I used to...

448
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,638
...to draw water out of that well.

449
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,470
Would you like a cool drink of water?

450
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,772
How do you do?
I'm Aunt Rose Comfort McCorkle.

451
00:36:30,948 --> 00:36:35,715
My brother was Baby Doll's daddy,
Mr. T.C. Carson McCorkle.

452
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,485
I've been visiting here since...

453
00:36:40,057 --> 00:36:43,993
Well, just now I can't remember
just when it was since.

454
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,459
I hope you don't mind
drinking out of a gourd.

455
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,097
Oh, thank you.

456
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,662
Excuse me, please.

457
00:36:54,905 --> 00:36:59,001
That old hen Fuss has got back
in my kitchen again.

458
00:37:00,244 --> 00:37:02,371
I can think of worse ways
to spend a afternoon...

459
00:37:02,547 --> 00:37:05,948
...delivering cool well water
to Mrs. Meighan.

460
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:16,722
You stay with the cotton, you hear?
Go on, stay with the cotton.

461
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:24,699
There's such a difference in water.

462
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:28,168
You wouldn't think so,
but there certainly is.

463
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,605
I take it you've not had this place long,
Mrs. Meighan.

464
00:37:32,777 --> 00:37:35,405
No, we ain't had it long.

465
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:41,279
Don't you have garbage collectors
on Tiger Tail Road?

466
00:37:41,953 --> 00:37:45,445
Oh, well, it costs a little bit extra
for them to come out here.

467
00:37:45,623 --> 00:37:47,614
And Archie Lee...

468
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:51,922
Oh, I don't know.
I almost give up sometimes.

469
00:37:53,932 --> 00:37:58,699
Did I understand you to say you got a
bunch of unfurnished rooms in this house?

470
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,770
Five complete sets of furniture...

471
00:38:00,939 --> 00:38:05,137
...hauled away by the Ideal Pay As You Go
Plan Furniture Company.

472
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,568
When did this misfortune fall upon you?

473
00:38:10,015 --> 00:38:11,812
Yesterday.

474
00:38:11,984 --> 00:38:14,282
Ain't that awful? Yesterday.

475
00:38:14,453 --> 00:38:17,445
Both of us had misfortunes
on the same day.

476
00:38:18,157 --> 00:38:20,717
You lost your furniture,
my cotton gin burned down.

477
00:38:20,893 --> 00:38:22,554
Oh, yeah.

478
00:38:22,728 --> 00:38:25,288
- Quite a coincidence.
- What's that?

479
00:38:25,464 --> 00:38:28,262
I said, it was coincidence of misfortune.

480
00:38:28,434 --> 00:38:34,566
Oh, why, sure. I mean, what can you do
with a bunch of unfurnished rooms?

481
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:40,609
Well, we could play hide-and-seek.

482
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:43,612
Not me, I'm not athletic.

483
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:46,415
Yeah, well, when I arrived
in this county...

484
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:49,748
...to take over the management
of the Syndicate Plantation...

485
00:38:49,922 --> 00:38:52,857
...this house was empty.
I was told it was haunted.

486
00:38:53,025 --> 00:38:57,553
Oh, yeah, it was haunted. That's why
Archie Lee got it for almost nothing.

487
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:00,631
Sometimes I don't know
where to go or what to do.

488
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:04,496
Well, that's not uncommon.
People enter this world without instruction.

489
00:39:05,271 --> 00:39:06,932
I said...

490
00:39:07,106 --> 00:39:09,939
Is that your breakfast, Mrs. Meighan?

491
00:39:12,077 --> 00:39:16,912
I said, people come into this world without
instruction of where to go or what to do.

492
00:39:17,082 --> 00:39:20,519
So they wander a little
and then go away.

493
00:39:20,687 --> 00:39:23,713
Drift for a while and then vanish.

494
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:26,415
And so make room for newcomers.

495
00:39:27,694 --> 00:39:29,787
Old goers...

496
00:39:29,963 --> 00:39:31,396
...newcomers...

497
00:39:31,565 --> 00:39:35,831
...going and coming, back and forth.
Rush, rush.

498
00:39:36,603 --> 00:39:38,594
Permanent...

499
00:39:38,772 --> 00:39:40,205
...nothing.

500
00:39:41,841 --> 00:39:44,207
Anything living...

501
00:39:44,377 --> 00:39:47,471
...that lasts long enough
to take it serious...

502
00:39:49,049 --> 00:39:50,812
What's this?

503
00:39:50,984 --> 00:39:53,976
This is that old Pierce-Arrow car,
belong to Mrs. Dobine.

504
00:39:54,154 --> 00:39:57,612
The lady that used to own this house
and haunts it now.

505
00:39:57,791 --> 00:39:59,656
Where to, madam?

506
00:39:59,826 --> 00:40:02,454
We're gonna play chauffeur.

507
00:40:04,297 --> 00:40:06,128
Yeah, goodbye now.

508
00:40:07,067 --> 00:40:08,534
Hey.

509
00:40:08,702 --> 00:40:12,638
Drive me along the river
with all the windows open to cool me off.

510
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:16,631
- The chauffeur sits in the front seat.
- Front seat's got no cushion.

511
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:17,936
Oh, yeah.

512
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:22,878
Come on, men, get on your big feet,
let's go! Come on!

513
00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:24,812
Oh, let's gin some cotton.

514
00:40:24,986 --> 00:40:29,616
Come on, men. Get on those big feet.
Let's get in here.

515
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,190
Oh, let's cut some cotton.

516
00:40:34,762 --> 00:40:36,320
It's hard to find a place to sit...

517
00:40:36,497 --> 00:40:39,591
...since the Ideal Pay As You Go Plan
Furniture Company lost patience.

518
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:41,826
- To sit in comfort...
- Hard to sit in comfort...

519
00:40:42,003 --> 00:40:45,598
...when the Ideal Pay As You Go Plan
people lose their patience...

520
00:40:45,806 --> 00:40:48,274
...and your gin burns down.

521
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,876
- Would you move your leg?
- But it's cool here.

522
00:40:59,053 --> 00:41:01,317
Comfortable to sit in.

523
00:41:02,056 --> 00:41:05,548
- What's this here?
- That's my charm bracelet.

524
00:41:05,726 --> 00:41:08,194
My daddy gave it to me.

525
00:41:08,496 --> 00:41:10,623
Them's the Ten Commandments.

526
00:41:10,798 --> 00:41:14,097
- And these here?
- My birthdays.

527
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:18,132
How many charming birthdays
have you had?

528
00:41:18,339 --> 00:41:21,604
As many as there are charms
on the bracelet.

529
00:41:21,976 --> 00:41:24,206
- Mind if I...?
- Count them.

530
00:41:30,584 --> 00:41:36,148
Fourteen, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

531
00:41:36,324 --> 00:41:38,019
That's all.

532
00:41:38,527 --> 00:41:40,290
I'll be 20 tomorrow.

533
00:41:40,462 --> 00:41:44,660
Tomorrow is election day
and my birthday...

534
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:48,792
...and the day that Mr. Franklin Delano
Roosevelt was elected for his first term.

535
00:41:49,438 --> 00:41:52,965
It's a great day for the country
for both reasons.

536
00:41:53,775 --> 00:41:56,710
Oh, he was a man to respect.

537
00:41:56,878 --> 00:42:00,143
Well, you're a lady to respect,
Mrs. Meighan.

538
00:42:00,315 --> 00:42:02,749
Me? No.

539
00:42:02,918 --> 00:42:05,512
I never got past the fourth grade.

540
00:42:05,687 --> 00:42:07,587
Why'd you quit?

541
00:42:07,756 --> 00:42:11,920
Well, I had a great deal of trouble
with long division.

542
00:42:12,094 --> 00:42:13,391
Yeah?

543
00:42:13,562 --> 00:42:15,553
The teacher would send me
to the blackboard...

544
00:42:15,731 --> 00:42:18,825
...to work on a problem
in long division...

545
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,366
...and I would go up
to the blackboard...

546
00:42:21,536 --> 00:42:27,998
...and lean my head against it
and just cry and cry and cry.

547
00:42:29,444 --> 00:42:31,935
Would you move your leg?

548
00:42:33,248 --> 00:42:35,478
Do you wanna move my leg?

549
00:42:36,218 --> 00:42:38,812
Yeah, otherwise I can't get out.

550
00:42:39,788 --> 00:42:41,586
Okay.

551
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:43,447
Well...

552
00:42:44,894 --> 00:42:48,830
...I would just cry and cry and cry.

553
00:42:48,998 --> 00:42:51,899
Well, finally I left school and...

554
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:56,801
Oh, a girl without education
is a girl without educ...

555
00:42:57,874 --> 00:42:59,933
Mr. Vacarro?

556
00:43:00,877 --> 00:43:03,607
Just picking up a few pecan nuts.

557
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:07,476
Excuse me.

558
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,983
Excuse me, Mr. Vacarro,
but I wouldn't dream of eating a nut...

559
00:43:11,154 --> 00:43:13,816
...which a man had cracked
in his mouth.

560
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:16,823
You've got many refinements.

561
00:43:17,193 --> 00:43:18,888
Thank you.

562
00:43:19,762 --> 00:43:25,098
Now, I don't think you need worry
about your failure at long division.

563
00:43:25,268 --> 00:43:27,862
After all, you got through short division.

564
00:43:28,037 --> 00:43:31,529
Short division's all a lady
ought to be called on to cope with.

565
00:43:31,707 --> 00:43:33,299
Yeah.

566
00:43:33,743 --> 00:43:35,335
Well...

567
00:43:35,511 --> 00:43:38,173
...I ought to be going in now.

568
00:43:43,352 --> 00:43:48,416
But I get so depressed going through
all them empty rooms.

569
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:50,355
All the rooms empty?

570
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:54,691
All except the nursery and the kitchen.
The stuff in them rooms is paid for.

571
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:57,129
You have a child in the nursery?

572
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,168
Me? No.

573
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:02,669
I sleep in the nursery myself.

574
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,434
I let the slats down on the crib.

575
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:08,203
Why do you sleep in the nursery?

576
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:13,880
Mr. Vacarro, that's a personal question.

577
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:22,752
Well, I ought to be going in now.

578
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:36,772
But, you know, there are rooms
in that house that I never been in.

579
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,431
Like, for instance, the attic.

580
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:43,979
You know that most of the time I'm scared
to go in that house by myself?

581
00:44:44,147 --> 00:44:46,672
You take like last night,
when the fire broke out.

582
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,718
I sat here for hours and hours and hours
waiting for Archie Lee to come home...

583
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:54,119
...because I was scared to go
in that house by myself.

584
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:57,489
It must've been scary here without
your husband to look after you.

585
00:44:57,662 --> 00:44:59,721
Oh, I'm telling you.

586
00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:04,995
The fire broke out and lit up the whole sky
with crazy shadows.

587
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:07,467
We didn't have a Coke in the house.

588
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:09,470
I was mad at Archie Lee.

589
00:45:09,641 --> 00:45:11,768
You were mad at Mr. Meighan?
What about?

590
00:45:11,943 --> 00:45:14,639
He went off and left me
without a Coke in the house.

591
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:19,146
- Went off and left... Without a Coke, did he?
- Yes, he did. He certainly did.

592
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:22,753
And he didn't get back until way
after the fire had broken out.

593
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:28,587
And I got smoke in my eyes,
in my nose, in my throat.

594
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:33,724
I was in such a worn-out,
nervous condition, I cried.

595
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:38,392
Finally, I took two teaspoons
of paregoric.

596
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,663
Sounds like you passed
a very uncomfortable night.

597
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:46,799
Oh, sounds like. But it was.

598
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:51,281
So Mr. Meighan, you say,
disappeared after supper?

599
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:57,783
You say Mr. Meighan left the house
for a while after supper?

600
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,682
Oh, yeah, for a moment.

601
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:02,554
Just for a moment, huh?

602
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:05,688
How long a moment?

603
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:09,061
- What are you driving at, Mr. Vacarro?
- Driving at?

604
00:46:09,234 --> 00:46:11,668
Yes, you're looking at me so funny.

605
00:46:11,837 --> 00:46:15,534
How long a moment did he disappear for?
Can you remember, Mrs. Meighan?

606
00:46:15,708 --> 00:46:17,835
Well, what difference does it make?
I mean...

607
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:21,104
...what does it matter to you anyway?
- Why should you mind my asking?

608
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,339
You make it sound like
I'm on trial for something.

609
00:46:23,515 --> 00:46:25,745
Don't you like to pretend
like you're a witness?

610
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,948
- Witness of what, Mr. Vacarro?
- Oh, say, for instance, a case of arson.

611
00:46:34,593 --> 00:46:35,821
What's arson?

612
00:46:35,995 --> 00:46:39,260
The willful destruction
of property by fire.

613
00:46:39,431 --> 00:46:40,489
What?

614
00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:44,999
Well, about... About my husband leaving
after supper, I can explain that.

615
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:46,694
- Can you?
- Oh, sure I can.

616
00:46:46,872 --> 00:46:49,966
Well, good. Now, how can you explain it?

617
00:46:51,477 --> 00:46:56,005
What's the matter, Mrs. Meighan?
Can't you collect your thoughts?

618
00:46:57,916 --> 00:47:00,783
Your mind's a blank on the subject?

619
00:47:02,621 --> 00:47:07,524
You find it impossible to remember just what
your husband disappeared for after supper?

620
00:47:08,761 --> 00:47:12,892
You can't imagine what kind of errand
he went on, can you? Can you?

621
00:47:13,299 --> 00:47:15,460
But when he returned...

622
00:47:15,635 --> 00:47:20,368
...well, let's see, the fire had just
broken out at the Syndicate Plantation.

623
00:47:22,342 --> 00:47:25,106
I can't imagine what
you could possibly be driving at.

624
00:47:25,278 --> 00:47:27,007
No?

625
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:30,980
You're a very unsatisfactory witness,
Mrs. Meighan.

626
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,980
Well, shall we drop the subject?

627
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:39,951
- Oh, I sure do wish you would.
- Well, sure.

628
00:47:41,561 --> 00:47:45,053
There's no use crying
over a burnt-down gin.

629
00:47:47,667 --> 00:47:50,431
Besides, like your husband says...

630
00:47:50,804 --> 00:47:55,104
...this world is built
on the principle of tit for tat.

631
00:47:56,643 --> 00:47:58,736
What do you mean by that?

632
00:48:02,048 --> 00:48:03,743
Nothing specific.

633
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:09,719
- Would you mind if I...?
- What?

634
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:11,914
Sit down.

635
00:48:12,092 --> 00:48:15,653
- Is it strong enough to support us both?
- Well, I hope.

636
00:48:16,629 --> 00:48:19,428
Now, let's swing a little, huh?

637
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,660
You seem all tense.

638
00:48:22,837 --> 00:48:25,362
Motion relaxes people.

639
00:48:26,006 --> 00:48:27,940
It's like a cradle.

640
00:48:28,109 --> 00:48:31,044
A cradle relaxes a baby.

641
00:48:32,446 --> 00:48:35,779
- They call you Baby, don't they?
- Oh, that's sort of a nickname.

642
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:39,044
Well, in a swing you can relax
just like in a cradle.

643
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,381
Well, I don't like to swing.
It shakes me up.

644
00:48:41,555 --> 00:48:43,648
I'm relaxed enough,
as much as necessary.

645
00:48:43,824 --> 00:48:46,657
Oh, no, you're not.
Your nerves are all tied up.

646
00:48:46,827 --> 00:48:49,728
- Well, you make me nervous.
- Just swinging with you?

647
00:48:49,897 --> 00:48:52,058
- No, not just that.
- What else, then?

648
00:48:52,233 --> 00:48:54,599
All them questions you asked me
about the fire.

649
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:59,701
I was only inquiring
about your husband.

650
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:02,368
About his leaving the house
after supper.

651
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:06,769
But there's no reason why
I should have to explain things to you.

652
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:08,911
No.

653
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:11,074
Should we just relax?

654
00:49:16,457 --> 00:49:19,255
Would you move over
and make a little room?

655
00:49:21,362 --> 00:49:26,096
- Is that enough room for you?
- It's enough for me. How about you?

656
00:49:28,837 --> 00:49:31,965
It was a lovely remark
your husband made.

657
00:49:32,507 --> 00:49:35,340
The good-neighbor policy, I mean.

658
00:49:36,645 --> 00:49:40,979
"You do me a good turn
and I'll do you one".

659
00:49:42,517 --> 00:49:44,747
That was the way he put it.

660
00:49:52,494 --> 00:49:55,054
- There now.
- Thanks.

661
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:58,688
There's a lot of fine cotton lint
floating around in the air.

662
00:49:58,867 --> 00:50:01,734
I know there is.
It bothers my sinus.

663
00:50:01,903 --> 00:50:05,304
Well, you're a very delicate woman,
Mrs. Meighan.

664
00:50:06,374 --> 00:50:09,343
Delicate? Me?

665
00:50:09,511 --> 00:50:14,505
There isn't much of you,
but what there is is choice.

666
00:50:14,883 --> 00:50:16,714
Delectable, I might say.

667
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,450
You are fine-fibered.

668
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:24,090
Soft.

669
00:50:24,326 --> 00:50:26,692
Smooth.

670
00:50:28,363 --> 00:50:32,197
Mr. Vacarro, our conversation certainly
is taking a personal turn.

671
00:50:32,367 --> 00:50:35,735
You make me think of cotton. No.

672
00:50:36,706 --> 00:50:39,607
No fabric or cloth...

673
00:50:39,775 --> 00:50:43,871
...not even satin or silk cloth...

674
00:50:44,046 --> 00:50:45,707
...and no kind of fiber...

675
00:50:45,881 --> 00:50:48,645
...not even cotton fiber...

676
00:50:49,318 --> 00:50:52,879
...has the absolute delicacy
of your skin.

677
00:50:53,122 --> 00:50:55,955
Well, what should I say,
thanks or something?

678
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:58,491
Now, you just smile, Mrs. Meighan.

679
00:50:58,661 --> 00:51:01,596
You've got an attractive smile.

680
00:51:02,465 --> 00:51:03,591
- Dimples.
- No.

681
00:51:03,766 --> 00:51:07,429
Oh, yes, you do.
Come on now, smile, Mrs. Meighan.

682
00:51:07,603 --> 00:51:10,595
There, you see? You do.
You do have them.

683
00:51:10,773 --> 00:51:14,004
Don't touch me. Please don't touch me.
I don't like to be touched.

684
00:51:14,176 --> 00:51:16,303
Well, why do you giggle?

685
00:51:16,479 --> 00:51:19,607
Because you make me feel
kind of hysterical, Mr. Vacarro.

686
00:51:19,782 --> 00:51:21,215
I do?

687
00:51:21,384 --> 00:51:24,319
- Mr. Vacarro?
- Yes?

688
00:51:26,489 --> 00:51:30,084
I think I'll go and make us
some lemonade.

689
00:51:31,327 --> 00:51:33,693
What did you do that for?

690
00:51:33,863 --> 00:51:37,731
I don't wanna be deprived of the pleasure
of your company.

691
00:51:38,134 --> 00:51:39,761
Not yet.

692
00:51:41,171 --> 00:51:44,436
Oh, Mr. Vacarro,
you certainly are getting familiar.

693
00:51:44,608 --> 00:51:46,769
Don't you have any fun-loving spirit
about you?

694
00:51:46,943 --> 00:51:48,740
Well, this isn't fun.

695
00:51:48,912 --> 00:51:51,210
Well, why do you giggle, then?

696
00:51:51,715 --> 00:51:54,843
- Because I'm ticklish.
- You're ticklish?

697
00:51:55,986 --> 00:51:58,113
Don't be so skittish.

698
00:51:59,222 --> 00:52:02,020
All right, I'll get up, then.

699
00:52:05,329 --> 00:52:06,819
Go on.

700
00:52:15,706 --> 00:52:18,197
I feel so weak.

701
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:33,621
My head is buzzy.

702
00:52:34,958 --> 00:52:36,425
Buzzy?

703
00:52:39,062 --> 00:52:41,792
Fuzzy and buzzy.

704
00:52:47,437 --> 00:52:50,430
My head is swinging round.

705
00:52:55,413 --> 00:52:58,246
Must have been that swinging
that done it.

706
00:53:21,005 --> 00:53:22,836
- Is there something on my arm?
- No.

707
00:53:23,007 --> 00:53:26,465
Well, then cut it out, it feels funny.

708
00:53:26,644 --> 00:53:30,740
- How does it feel?
- Oh, it feels funny all up and down.

709
00:53:30,915 --> 00:53:34,146
- Quit switching me, will you?
- I'm just shooing the flies off.

710
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:36,286
They don't hurt nothing.

711
00:53:36,454 --> 00:53:40,720
- Now, cut it out or I'm gonna call.
- You're gonna call who?

712
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:44,653
- Boy on the road.
- Well, go on, call then.

713
00:53:45,897 --> 00:53:47,888
Boy!

714
00:53:50,234 --> 00:53:52,327
Can't you call any louder?

715
00:53:52,503 --> 00:53:54,767
- Oh, I feel so...
- Can't you call any louder?

716
00:53:54,939 --> 00:53:57,101
I feel so funny. What's...?

717
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:59,870
- What's the matter with me?
- You're just relaxing.

718
00:54:00,045 --> 00:54:03,742
- Give in, now. Stop fighting it.
- Oh, I'm not...

719
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:06,544
- I'm not fighting it, but it's you...
- I?

720
00:54:06,718 --> 00:54:08,185
...and your suspicions...

721
00:54:08,353 --> 00:54:13,450
...about my husband. Suspicions...
- Suspicions? Suspicions such as?

722
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,183
That he burnt down your gin.

723
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,521
- Well?
- Well, he didn't.

724
00:54:17,696 --> 00:54:21,132
- Didn't he?
- No, he didn't.

725
00:54:21,834 --> 00:54:24,428
He... He didn't.

726
00:54:24,603 --> 00:54:27,629
I'm going in the house now.

727
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,400
You believe in ghosts, Mrs. Meighan?

728
00:54:30,609 --> 00:54:34,841
I do. I believe in the presence
of evil spirits.

729
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,412
What evil spirits you talking about?

730
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:41,041
Spirits of violence and cunning...

731
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:46,453
...malevolence, cruelty, treachery,
destruction.

732
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:48,923
Them's just human characteristics.

733
00:54:49,628 --> 00:54:54,156
The evil spirits that haunt the human heart
and take possession of it...

734
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:58,429
...and spread from one human heart
to another human heart...

735
00:54:58,604 --> 00:55:01,539
...the way a fire goes
springing from leaf to leaf...

736
00:55:01,707 --> 00:55:06,111
...and branch to branch in a tree
till a forest is all aflame with it.

737
00:55:06,279 --> 00:55:08,406
You just got fire on the brain.

738
00:55:08,581 --> 00:55:11,345
I see it as more than it seems
to be on the surface.

739
00:55:11,518 --> 00:55:15,318
I saw it last night as an explosion
of those evil spirits.

740
00:55:15,488 --> 00:55:21,984
I fought it. I ran into it, beating it,
stamping it, shouting the curse of God at it.

741
00:55:22,161 --> 00:55:26,530
They dragged me out suffocating.
I was defeated.

742
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:29,190
When I came to,
lying on the ground...

743
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:31,200
...the fire had won the battle.

744
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:33,635
And all around was a ring
of human figures.

745
00:55:34,507 --> 00:55:37,772
I looked up. They were illuminated.

746
00:55:37,944 --> 00:55:41,436
Their eyes, their teeth were shining
like this.

747
00:55:41,614 --> 00:55:43,980
- Yeah, like this. Like this.
- No, don't scare me.

748
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:48,917
- Please don't scare me.
- The faces I saw were grinning.

749
00:55:49,222 --> 00:55:51,190
And then I knew.

750
00:55:51,357 --> 00:55:55,020
I knew the fire was not accidental.

751
00:55:55,695 --> 00:55:59,028
And you know it was not accidental too.

752
00:55:59,198 --> 00:56:04,226
It was an expression,
a manifestation of the need to destroy.

753
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:06,736
And so I say I believe in ghosts...

754
00:56:06,906 --> 00:56:08,464
...in haunted places...

755
00:56:08,641 --> 00:56:11,110
...in places haunted by the people
that occupy them...

756
00:56:11,278 --> 00:56:14,941
...with hearts overrun by demons
of hate and destruction.

757
00:56:15,115 --> 00:56:18,380
I believe his place, this house,
is haunted.

758
00:56:18,552 --> 00:56:23,114
- Aunt Rose. Aunt Rose Comfort!
- This house is haunted.

759
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:26,316
I think I'm going around the back door
and make us some lemonade.

760
00:56:28,228 --> 00:56:31,061
- Archie Lee.
- Archie Lee, huh?

761
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:33,028
Archie Lee.

762
00:56:36,837 --> 00:56:39,465
Yeah, let's go see Archie Lee now.

763
00:56:42,376 --> 00:56:44,241
Archie Lee.

764
00:56:55,189 --> 00:56:59,148
- What's going on up there?
- Contraption broke down.

765
00:57:15,576 --> 00:57:18,341
You better stay away from Mr. Archie,
he's fit to be tied.

766
00:57:21,282 --> 00:57:22,943
It's stuck. Give me the wrench.

767
00:57:23,118 --> 00:57:25,518
Come on, give me the wrench, man.
Give...

768
00:57:25,687 --> 00:57:28,986
Archie Lee, I got something to tell you,
you big slob.

769
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:31,215
- What are you doing here?
- You left me there.

770
00:57:31,393 --> 00:57:34,089
I tell you never to come here
when niggers are working here.

771
00:57:34,262 --> 00:57:35,820
You know what you left me with...?

772
00:57:37,699 --> 00:57:39,428
How's progress, Mr. Meighan?

773
00:57:40,702 --> 00:57:42,829
Fine, fine. Great, great.

774
00:57:43,004 --> 00:57:46,132
Personally, I can't hear
the gin running at all.

775
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:48,502
Big shot!

776
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:50,110
- What's holding up?
- Nothing.

777
00:57:50,278 --> 00:57:51,939
- Rock?
- The cylinder is busted.

778
00:57:52,113 --> 00:57:55,480
It figures. Meighan, I inspected your
equipment before I put in my own.

779
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:58,847
And I put up my own cotton gin
because this equipment was rotten!

780
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,352
- Take it easy.
- Was rotten and still is rotten.

781
00:58:01,523 --> 00:58:03,457
- It's quarter past 2.
- Don't get hysterical.

782
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:05,889
- You got wagons out on the runway.
- You Italians...

783
00:58:06,061 --> 00:58:08,427
- Never mind about "we Italians"!
- Take it easy.

784
00:58:08,596 --> 00:58:11,656
You better get a new saw cylinder
and get this contraption running.

785
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:13,824
If you can't get one in town,
go to Rosedale.

786
00:58:14,002 --> 00:58:16,334
- This contraption...
- If you can't get one there...

787
00:58:16,504 --> 00:58:20,668
...get across the river and go to Little Rock.
- I'll get one. I'll get one, but...

788
00:58:20,842 --> 00:58:25,837
One more crack out of you and the only
cotton you'll see will be in a drugstore.

789
00:58:26,015 --> 00:58:28,882
Now you better haul, brother.

790
00:58:37,026 --> 00:58:39,790
He'll go to Rosedale.

791
00:58:45,901 --> 00:58:49,860
- I got something to say to you, big shot.
- Please, I ain't got... I ain't got time.

792
00:58:50,039 --> 00:58:53,998
Big shot, big shot, big shot!
This gin!

793
00:58:54,376 --> 00:58:56,844
Boy, he's getting her again.

794
00:58:57,279 --> 00:59:00,146
Yep, we got a saw cylinder like this
in our commissary.

795
00:59:00,316 --> 00:59:01,908
Sure enough.

796
00:59:02,084 --> 00:59:06,453
Go bring it here, get Hank to help you.
And get this contraption running again.

797
00:59:06,622 --> 00:59:10,854
He's not gonna get a new one in town. If
he has to cross the river, don't wait for him.

798
00:59:11,026 --> 00:59:12,323
Rock.

799
00:59:13,496 --> 00:59:18,024
I'll leave the pickup truck with you.
Stay close to the house.

800
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,361
Stay there till I come out.

801
00:59:31,664 --> 00:59:34,361
Hey, Archie. Archie Lee!

802
00:59:34,535 --> 00:59:38,130
Archie Lee! Archie!

803
00:59:54,154 --> 00:59:57,715
No, don't touch me.
Please don't touch me.

804
00:59:58,359 --> 01:00:03,319
Aunt Rose. Aunt Rose Comfort.

805
01:00:03,497 --> 01:00:07,957
Gotta go see a mighty sick friend
in county hospital.

806
01:00:10,371 --> 01:00:14,239
You might as well shout at the moon
as that old woman.

807
01:00:22,182 --> 01:00:23,547
You don't want her to go?

808
01:00:23,717 --> 01:00:27,585
Well, she's got no business
leaving me alone here.

809
01:00:29,623 --> 01:00:33,582
But she has a passion
for chocolate candy, though.

810
01:00:34,995 --> 01:00:37,828
She watches the newspapers
just like a hawk...

811
01:00:37,998 --> 01:00:41,867
...to see if anybody she knows is
registered at the county hospital.

812
01:00:42,037 --> 01:00:43,902
- The hospital?
- Yeah.

813
01:00:44,072 --> 01:00:49,772
They pass out candy to the patients
at the county hospital, you know.

814
01:00:49,944 --> 01:00:54,574
Friends and relatives send them
flowers and candy.

815
01:00:54,749 --> 01:00:59,311
Aunt Rose Comfort goes to visit them
and eats up all the chocolate candy.

816
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:07,585
Last week, an old lady friend
of Aunt Rose Comfort's...

817
01:01:07,762 --> 01:01:10,230
...was dying at the county hospital.

818
01:01:10,398 --> 01:01:14,300
And Aunt Rose Comfort
went to visit her...

819
01:01:14,469 --> 01:01:18,064
...and ate up all her chocolate candy.
- All?

820
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:21,970
Right while the old woman was dying,
she ate it all.

821
01:01:23,978 --> 01:01:26,947
I like old people. They're crazy.

822
01:01:30,952 --> 01:01:36,390
Mrs. Meighan, do you mind
if I ask you a personal question?

823
01:01:36,558 --> 01:01:38,219
What, Mr. Vacarro?

824
01:01:38,393 --> 01:01:41,226
Are you really married to Mr. Meighan?

825
01:01:42,764 --> 01:01:46,393
Mr. Vacarro, that is a personal question.

826
01:01:46,568 --> 01:01:50,528
All questions are more or less personal,
Mrs. Meighan.

827
01:01:52,074 --> 01:01:53,632
Well...

828
01:01:55,444 --> 01:01:56,843
See...

829
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,008
...when I...

830
01:01:59,181 --> 01:02:03,550
When I got married, well,
I wasn't ready for marriage yet.

831
01:02:03,719 --> 01:02:06,119
I was only 18.

832
01:02:06,388 --> 01:02:09,824
But my daddy was practically
on his deathbed...

833
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:13,291
...and he wanted to see me took care of
before he died.

834
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:18,365
And old Archie Lee had been hanging
around like a sick dog for quite some time.

835
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:20,627
And the boys around here are a sorry lot.

836
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:25,001
They ask you to the movies and take you
out to the old stone quarry instead.

837
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:27,608
You gotta get out of the car
and throw stones at them.

838
01:02:27,776 --> 01:02:32,475
I've had some experiences here with boys
that would curl your hair if I told you.

839
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:35,811
The experiences
which I've had with boys.

840
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,982
Oh, but...

841
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:43,382
...old Archie Lee, you know,
he was an older fella.

842
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,391
Well, his business was better
in those days.

843
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:49,087
He was ginning out lots of cotton.

844
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,893
That's before you put up your cotton gin,
you remember?

845
01:02:52,067 --> 01:02:53,830
Yeah, I remember.

846
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:59,533
Well, I told my daddy
that I wasn't ready for marriage...

847
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:02,974
...and my daddy told Archie Lee
that I wasn't ready for it...

848
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:08,709
...and Archie Lee promised my daddy
that he would wait until I was ready.

849
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:14,323
- Then the marriage was postponed?
- Oh, no, not the wedding.

850
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,855
We had the wedding.
My daddy gave me away.

851
01:03:18,028 --> 01:03:21,691
- But you said Archie Lee waited.
- Yeah, after the wedding, he waited.

852
01:03:21,865 --> 01:03:23,457
For what?

853
01:03:30,707 --> 01:03:33,073
For me to be ready for marriage.

854
01:03:33,243 --> 01:03:35,575
Well, how long did he have to wait?

855
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:38,145
Oh, he's still waiting.

856
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:44,680
We had an agreement, though.

857
01:03:45,055 --> 01:03:50,357
I mean, I told him that
on my 20th birthday, I'd be ready.

858
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,495
That's tomorrow.

859
01:03:53,463 --> 01:03:56,591
And are...? Will you be ready?

860
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:02,396
- Well, that all depends.
- What on?

861
01:04:03,207 --> 01:04:06,267
Whether or not the furniture comes back.

862
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:10,139
I guess.

863
01:04:10,381 --> 01:04:15,148
Your husband sweats more than any man
I know, and now I can understand why.

864
01:04:16,754 --> 01:04:18,415
Well, let's see.

865
01:04:18,589 --> 01:04:20,250
Well, I declare.

866
01:04:24,061 --> 01:04:25,756
I'm sorry. L...

867
01:04:27,665 --> 01:04:30,190
There. Now you wait right here.

868
01:04:30,368 --> 01:04:32,893
I'm gonna make lemonade
and serve it on the porch.

869
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:36,767
- Yes, ma'am, right here.
- You wait right there.

870
01:04:37,408 --> 01:04:41,071
- Now, you wait right there.
- Yes, ma'am, I'll wait.

871
01:04:41,846 --> 01:04:45,077
Yes, ma'am, I will stay right here.
Yes, ma'am.

872
01:05:10,642 --> 01:05:13,805
I'm gonna get me a Frigidaire
one of these days.

873
01:05:17,382 --> 01:05:21,546
Stupid old thing.
Forgot to light the stove.

874
01:06:28,154 --> 01:06:30,019
Mr. Vacarro?

875
01:06:39,065 --> 01:06:43,627
Oh, my goodness. We'll be having lemonade
in a minute now.

876
01:06:48,341 --> 01:06:51,504
Here, how'd you get that pretty dress
all wet?

877
01:07:16,068 --> 01:07:18,195
What a mess.

878
01:07:45,365 --> 01:07:48,823
Mr. Vacarro, now, you wait right there.

879
01:07:52,372 --> 01:07:54,704
Archie Lee, is that you?

880
01:08:13,227 --> 01:08:15,092
It needs something.

881
01:10:15,918 --> 01:10:17,579
Who's in there?

882
01:10:32,201 --> 01:10:35,295
Get out of my house.
What are you doing in my house?

883
01:10:37,973 --> 01:10:39,804
Get out of my house.

884
01:10:52,222 --> 01:10:56,625
Mr. Vacarro, I know that's you
and you're making me very nervous.

885
01:10:59,529 --> 01:11:01,292
Oh, yeah! I'll get you!

886
01:11:11,608 --> 01:11:16,272
- Help! Help! Help!
- Oh, you!

887
01:11:59,924 --> 01:12:02,916
- Open sesame.
- Game's over. I quit.

888
01:12:03,094 --> 01:12:05,528
No, you gotta play
hide-and-seek till you're it.

889
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:08,256
Now, Mr. Vacarro, would you please
go back downstairs...

890
01:12:08,432 --> 01:12:10,662
...so that I can unlock this door
and come out?

891
01:12:10,835 --> 01:12:12,769
This attic is in awful weak condition.

892
01:12:12,937 --> 01:12:17,374
You want me to call the fire department
to catch you when you fall through?

893
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:21,136
- No, there wouldn't be time.
- I don't suppose they'd get here on time.

894
01:12:21,312 --> 01:12:26,147
Any more than last night when they come
to put out the fire that burnt down my gin.

895
01:12:28,753 --> 01:12:30,914
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

896
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:34,589
Now, I'm gonna slip pencil and paper
under this door...

897
01:12:34,759 --> 01:12:37,057
...and all I want is your signature
on the paper.

898
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:39,492
- What paper?
- You might call it an affidavit...

899
01:12:39,663 --> 01:12:43,690
...legally stating that Archie Lee Meighan
burned down the Syndicate Gin.

900
01:12:45,503 --> 01:12:48,870
Mr. Vacarro! This floor's about to give out
right underneath me.

901
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:52,167
- Any minute. What do you say?
- Just leave it right there...

902
01:12:52,343 --> 01:12:54,743
...and I'll be happy to sign it
and send it to you.

903
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:56,504
Mrs. Meighan, I'm a Sicilian.

904
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:59,274
You know, we're a very old race
of people, an ancient race.

905
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:01,714
And ancient races aren't
trusting races by nature.

906
01:13:01,886 --> 01:13:06,824
You're either gonna sign this piece of paper
or I'm gonna break this door down.

907
01:13:06,992 --> 01:13:08,687
Do you hear me?

908
01:13:08,894 --> 01:13:11,294
I gather you don't believe me.

909
01:13:21,139 --> 01:13:24,233
Now, you're either gonna agree
to sign this thing...

910
01:13:24,576 --> 01:13:26,476
...or I'm coming out here...

911
01:13:26,645 --> 01:13:28,670
...and my additional weight...

912
01:13:32,584 --> 01:13:36,452
- What am I gonna do?
- You're gonna do what I tell you.

913
01:13:40,592 --> 01:13:41,923
No?

914
01:13:43,962 --> 01:13:48,831
No, don't hurt me.
I'll do anything, only hurry.

915
01:13:56,842 --> 01:13:59,970
- What do you want me to do?
- You can write your name.

916
01:15:04,243 --> 01:15:05,437
Go ahead.

917
01:15:12,451 --> 01:15:14,385
You can come out now.

918
01:15:15,688 --> 01:15:18,283
Need my descending footsteps
on the stairs?

919
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:21,552
- Hear my footsteps on the stairs?
- Oh, Mr. Vacarro!

920
01:15:22,596 --> 01:15:25,997
You hear my descending footsteps
on the stairs?

921
01:15:26,533 --> 01:15:28,694
Mr. Vacarro?

922
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:33,264
- Mr. Vacarro.
- Okay, you're home free and so am I.

923
01:15:33,573 --> 01:15:36,804
- Bye-bye.
- Wait a minute, where you going?

924
01:15:36,977 --> 01:15:40,174
Back to my little gray Quonset home
in the west...

925
01:15:40,347 --> 01:15:42,542
...to take a peaceful siesta.

926
01:15:42,716 --> 01:15:44,547
Well, I want to...

927
01:15:45,252 --> 01:15:47,083
I want to...

928
01:15:51,158 --> 01:15:53,592
Was that all that you wanted?

929
01:15:56,129 --> 01:15:59,155
Me to confess that Archie Lee
burnt down your gin?

930
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:02,324
What else did you imagine,
Mrs. Meighan?

931
01:16:05,105 --> 01:16:06,766
Well...

932
01:16:18,318 --> 01:16:20,286
Mrs. Meighan, I...

933
01:16:22,456 --> 01:16:24,890
You're a child, Mrs. Meighan.

934
01:16:25,426 --> 01:16:28,554
That's why we played
the game of hide-and-seek.

935
01:16:28,730 --> 01:16:30,994
It's a game for children.

936
01:16:33,034 --> 01:16:35,867
Well, you don't have to go
all the way home to take a nap.

937
01:16:36,037 --> 01:16:38,198
You could take a nap here.

938
01:16:38,706 --> 01:16:40,731
I mean, it's gonna rain anyhow.

939
01:16:44,412 --> 01:16:47,745
All the furniture's been removed
from the house.

940
01:16:48,449 --> 01:16:50,644
Not the stuff in the nursery.

941
01:16:50,818 --> 01:16:54,481
There's a small bed in there, a crib.

942
01:16:57,558 --> 01:16:59,617
You could curl up...

943
01:17:00,628 --> 01:17:02,823
...and let the slats down.

944
01:17:10,605 --> 01:17:13,438
I'll be happy to accept the invitation.

945
01:17:35,431 --> 01:17:37,865
Come on up and sing me to sleep.

946
01:17:48,911 --> 01:17:51,937
My daddy would turn over in his grave.

947
01:18:48,338 --> 01:18:50,272
- Sorry.
- No, come on. I'm good for it.

948
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:51,998
- I got orders.
- I'll take my trade...

949
01:18:52,175 --> 01:18:54,769
- No credit.
- I'll take it somewhere else!

950
01:18:54,944 --> 01:18:57,538
- Look. Listen, my daddy's watch.
- Cash.

951
01:18:57,714 --> 01:19:01,912
Here. The letters of his name
instead of numbers, huh?

952
01:19:02,085 --> 01:19:03,643
I'm gonna leave this watch
with you.

953
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:06,721
- Cash.
- Give it to him and get him out of here!

954
01:19:07,924 --> 01:19:09,448
Thank you, sir.

955
01:19:09,926 --> 01:19:12,292
I'm much obliged to you, sir.

956
01:19:28,378 --> 01:19:30,539
Will you get this thing going?
Come on, now.

957
01:19:30,713 --> 01:19:32,578
- Come on, now, will you?
- Shut up.

958
01:19:32,749 --> 01:19:35,809
We're going as fast as we can.

959
01:19:57,074 --> 01:19:59,474
You all must have done
some mighty fast repairs.

960
01:19:59,643 --> 01:20:02,612
- No repairs. Put in a new saw cylinder.
- From where?

961
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:04,839
Boss and I had one at our place.

962
01:20:05,015 --> 01:20:08,280
How come I wasn't let in on this
information before I lit out of here?

963
01:20:08,452 --> 01:20:11,421
I just about killed myself getting that.
Where's that wop, Vacarro?

964
01:20:11,589 --> 01:20:14,558
I wanna get some explanation of this.
Vacarro!

965
01:20:14,925 --> 01:20:16,358
Where is he?

966
01:20:16,527 --> 01:20:18,791
- You seen the boss man, Norm?
- No, sir.

967
01:20:18,963 --> 01:20:20,430
You seen the boss man, Moose?

968
01:20:20,598 --> 01:20:22,293
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

969
01:20:24,168 --> 01:20:25,760
Where are my men?

970
01:20:25,936 --> 01:20:29,929
Oh, I sent them home.
I mean, they're useless.

971
01:20:31,242 --> 01:20:33,335
Well, you keep operating.

972
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:41,044
Hey! You know, this isn't a bad old gin.

973
01:21:16,354 --> 01:21:18,652
Hey, anybody living here?

974
01:21:22,027 --> 01:21:25,394
Anybody still living in this house?

975
01:21:41,413 --> 01:21:43,210
It's Archie Lee.

976
01:22:20,186 --> 01:22:22,154
What happened here?

977
01:22:23,589 --> 01:22:26,456
- I said, what happened here?
- The plaster broke in the attic.

978
01:22:26,625 --> 01:22:29,651
Well, how? How did...?
How'd that happen?

979
01:22:30,029 --> 01:22:33,988
How did anything happen?
It just happened.

980
01:22:36,001 --> 01:22:39,232
Ain't I told you
not to slop around here in a slip?

981
01:22:40,439 --> 01:22:43,772
Ain't I told you
not to slop around here in a slip?

982
01:22:43,943 --> 01:22:46,776
Supper almost ready now.

983
01:22:52,651 --> 01:22:56,109
The breakage alone in that kitchen
would ruin a well-to-do man.

984
01:22:56,455 --> 01:23:00,789
Now, you go on up and get some decent
clothes on you. Then come back down here.

985
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:04,088
You know, there's a new bureau
in Washington, D.C.

986
01:23:04,263 --> 01:23:07,494
It's called the UW Bureau.
You know what UW stands for?

987
01:23:07,666 --> 01:23:10,260
It stands for "useless women".

988
01:23:10,437 --> 01:23:12,871
They got secret plans to put the...

989
01:23:14,641 --> 01:23:18,077
To rounding them all up and shoot them.
That's what...

990
01:23:19,079 --> 01:23:20,512
Shoot them.

991
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:23,240
Now, you heard me. I said, shoot them.

992
01:23:23,417 --> 01:23:25,578
How about men that's destructive?

993
01:23:25,752 --> 01:23:30,348
Ain't they got some plan to round up
destructive men and shoot them?

994
01:23:30,524 --> 01:23:32,856
What destructive men
you talking about?

995
01:23:33,026 --> 01:23:37,292
Men that blows things up
and burns things down...

996
01:23:37,464 --> 01:23:41,298
...because they're too evil
and too stupid to get along otherwise.

997
01:23:41,868 --> 01:23:44,564
Because their competition
is too much for them.

998
01:23:44,738 --> 01:23:46,968
So they turn criminal.

999
01:23:47,607 --> 01:23:50,098
They do things like arson...

1000
01:23:50,277 --> 01:23:53,804
...the willful destruction
of property by fire.

1001
01:23:59,352 --> 01:24:03,311
- Who said that to you?
- Hey, look what's up there on the porch.

1002
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:05,424
Light the light,
there's men on the road.

1003
01:24:05,592 --> 01:24:07,958
Never mind, now.
Who said arson to you, huh?

1004
01:24:08,128 --> 01:24:10,460
Who spoke of this "willful destruction"?

1005
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:13,599
Why, you never knew them words.
Who said them to you?

1006
01:24:14,768 --> 01:24:16,292
Sometimes, big shot...

1007
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:20,168
...you don't seem to give me credit
for very much intelligence at all.

1008
01:24:20,341 --> 01:24:23,003
I've been to school in my life.

1009
01:24:23,177 --> 01:24:25,771
And I'm a magazine reader.

1010
01:24:33,087 --> 01:24:34,486
Who gave that whistle?

1011
01:24:34,655 --> 01:24:37,624
Don't you give a wolf whistle
at my wife!

1012
01:24:37,792 --> 01:24:40,727
You just stay on that side
of that fence, do you hear?

1013
01:24:40,895 --> 01:24:43,329
Right on that side over there!

1014
01:24:56,444 --> 01:24:59,777
Men from the Syndicate Plantation,
white and black mixed.

1015
01:24:59,947 --> 01:25:02,643
Headed for Tiger Tail Bayou
with straw gigs and rubber boots on.

1016
01:25:02,817 --> 01:25:05,012
I just hope they turn downstream.

1017
01:25:05,186 --> 01:25:07,984
I just hope they trespass across
my property. I hope they dare.

1018
01:25:08,322 --> 01:25:11,052
I'll blast them out of the bayou
with a shotgun.

1019
01:25:11,225 --> 01:25:14,922
- Small dogs have a large bark.
- No one's gonna insult no woman of mine.

1020
01:25:15,229 --> 01:25:18,221
You take a lot for granted
when you say "mine".

1021
01:25:18,399 --> 01:25:22,165
I came to you today for protection.
And what did I get?

1022
01:25:22,336 --> 01:25:24,065
Slapped. Sent home.

1023
01:25:24,672 --> 01:25:28,541
Now, I'm telling you
that the agreement between us is over.

1024
01:25:28,710 --> 01:25:32,737
You darn tooting it's over.
In just three hours...

1025
01:25:32,915 --> 01:25:36,180
Three hours, the terms of our agreement
will be settled for good.

1026
01:25:36,351 --> 01:25:38,319
- Don't count on it.
- Sharp at midnight.

1027
01:25:38,487 --> 01:25:42,287
- Too much has happened here lately.
- Well, my credit is wide open again.

1028
01:25:42,457 --> 01:25:44,857
And so is the jailhouse door
if the truth comes out.

1029
01:25:45,027 --> 01:25:49,760
- Are you threatening me with black...?
- Heigh-ho, Silva!

1030
01:25:53,869 --> 01:25:58,966
Archie Lee, Mr. Vacarro says that
he might not put up a new cotton gin...

1031
01:25:59,141 --> 01:26:01,837
...but might let you gin out his cotton
for him all the time.

1032
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:03,944
Ain't you pleased about that?

1033
01:26:04,179 --> 01:26:06,909
He's gonna come tomorrow
with lots more cotton.

1034
01:26:07,082 --> 01:26:10,074
And while you're ginning it out,
he's gonna have me entertain him.

1035
01:26:10,686 --> 01:26:12,950
Make lemonade for him.

1036
01:26:13,355 --> 01:26:17,257
And it's gonna go on and on,
maybe even till next fall.

1037
01:26:19,227 --> 01:26:22,424
It's the good-neighbor policy in practice.

1038
01:26:30,872 --> 01:26:32,897
How long you been on the place?

1039
01:26:33,076 --> 01:26:38,036
All this unusually long fall afternoon
I've imposed on your hospitality.

1040
01:26:43,286 --> 01:26:47,950
- Where you been here?
- Taking a nap on your only remaining bed.

1041
01:26:48,124 --> 01:26:51,525
The crib in the nursery
with the slats let down.

1042
01:26:51,694 --> 01:26:54,254
Something sad about it,
know what I mean?

1043
01:26:54,430 --> 01:26:55,829
Sad about what?

1044
01:26:55,999 --> 01:26:58,866
An unoccupied nursery in the house...

1045
01:26:59,035 --> 01:27:01,697
...and all other rooms empty.

1046
01:27:03,406 --> 01:27:05,340
That's no problem of yours.

1047
01:27:05,508 --> 01:27:09,274
A good-neighbor policy
makes your problems mine and vice versa.

1048
01:27:09,846 --> 01:27:11,973
Supper ready, children.

1049
01:27:12,148 --> 01:27:15,982
Well, didn't you all hear us
called in to supper?

1050
01:27:18,388 --> 01:27:20,185
You gonna eat here tonight?

1051
01:27:20,356 --> 01:27:22,916
Mrs. Meighan asked me
to stay for supper.

1052
01:27:23,092 --> 01:27:27,051
But I told her I better get to hear
the invitation from the head of the house...

1053
01:27:27,230 --> 01:27:29,858
...before I'd feel free to accept it.

1054
01:27:30,466 --> 01:27:32,263
So, what do you say?

1055
01:27:37,173 --> 01:27:39,368
Stay for supper.

1056
01:27:39,542 --> 01:27:44,810
- Well, you'll have to take potluck.
- I wouldn't be putting you out?

1057
01:27:47,785 --> 01:27:50,720
Excuse me, I better get into my clothes.

1058
01:27:50,888 --> 01:27:54,517
Oh, yeah. You better.

1059
01:28:39,136 --> 01:28:42,196
Did I understand you to say that...

1060
01:28:42,372 --> 01:28:43,634
That...

1061
01:28:45,776 --> 01:28:48,871
...you wouldn't build a new gin
but would leave your business to me?

1062
01:28:49,047 --> 01:28:52,346
- Lf that's agreeable with you.
- I don't know about that.

1063
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:57,620
Well, I gotta consider the matter.

1064
01:28:58,323 --> 01:29:00,314
Financing is involved.

1065
01:29:00,492 --> 01:29:04,724
Such as new equipment and...

1066
01:29:06,131 --> 01:29:08,065
Let's go in and eat now.

1067
01:29:09,067 --> 01:29:12,798
I got a pain in the belly.
I got a sort of...

1068
01:29:12,971 --> 01:29:14,666
...heartburn.

1069
01:29:18,443 --> 01:29:20,001
Hey.

1070
01:29:20,178 --> 01:29:23,614
Hey, one more place at the table.

1071
01:29:23,815 --> 01:29:26,875
Mr. Vacarro from the Syndicate Plantation
is staying for supper.

1072
01:29:27,051 --> 01:29:31,249
I had no idea company was expected.
Just let me change...

1073
01:29:31,422 --> 01:29:34,721
Another place is all that's called for.

1074
01:29:38,997 --> 01:29:40,726
Have you been here all day?

1075
01:29:40,899 --> 01:29:43,868
Have you been in the house
or did you ride out to the hospital...

1076
01:29:44,035 --> 01:29:47,732
...and eat some more chocolate candy?
- I visited a friend in the hospital.

1077
01:29:47,906 --> 01:29:50,101
Then you were out while I...

1078
01:29:50,542 --> 01:29:52,669
I worked like the hammers of hell!

1079
01:29:52,844 --> 01:29:55,039
I come home,
the attic floor has fell through...

1080
01:29:55,213 --> 01:29:58,308
...my wife's bad-tempered and insulting
and a supper of hog slops!

1081
01:29:58,484 --> 01:30:00,816
I suppose you've got...

1082
01:30:03,455 --> 01:30:07,152
Sit down. I've gotta make me
a phone call.

1083
01:30:14,834 --> 01:30:16,062
Hello.

1084
01:30:16,235 --> 01:30:19,102
I want the Bright Spot, Miss Hopkins.
Give me the Bright Spot.

1085
01:30:19,405 --> 01:30:22,772
I can't think of the number now.
You give it to me, you hear?

1086
01:30:27,613 --> 01:30:29,376
Hello, Bright Spot.

1087
01:30:32,017 --> 01:30:34,747
He's on the phone about something.
If I was you, I wouldn't hang around.

1088
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:39,084
I got the ace of spades in my pocket
and I'm gonna get his autograph on it too.

1089
01:30:39,291 --> 01:30:40,519
Don't count on the law court.

1090
01:30:40,693 --> 01:30:42,422
Justice here is deaf and blind
as that woman.

1091
01:30:42,595 --> 01:30:44,654
I do my own justice.

1092
01:30:44,964 --> 01:30:49,560
Get Eddie, Beetle, Boots, Rhodes,
any one of them.

1093
01:30:50,102 --> 01:30:52,593
I'm advising you,
go while he's on the phone.

1094
01:30:52,771 --> 01:30:54,796
You don't know his friends.

1095
01:30:54,974 --> 01:30:57,465
- They're rough.
- I've seen them.

1096
01:30:58,878 --> 01:31:02,473
I find you different this evening
in some way.

1097
01:31:03,683 --> 01:31:05,514
Never mind that.

1098
01:31:05,685 --> 01:31:07,619
Just go while he's still
on the phone.

1099
01:31:07,787 --> 01:31:09,982
Grown up suddenly.

1100
01:31:15,095 --> 01:31:19,031
I feel cool and rested
for the first time in my life.

1101
01:31:20,634 --> 01:31:22,534
That's the way I feel.

1102
01:31:23,169 --> 01:31:26,002
Rested and cool.

1103
01:31:26,206 --> 01:31:29,334
And there's no place
he can run to in this county.

1104
01:31:30,076 --> 01:31:32,374
Well, you can say that again, boy.

1105
01:32:01,207 --> 01:32:04,199
You can't leave the place,
well, then you send someone.

1106
01:32:04,377 --> 01:32:07,039
But you send someone to find him,
you hear me?

1107
01:32:09,482 --> 01:32:11,144
I'll call you...

1108
01:32:11,786 --> 01:32:15,085
- Poems of nature. If I had...
- Never mind the poems of nature.

1109
01:32:15,256 --> 01:32:17,224
Goodbye, I'll call you later.

1110
01:32:18,859 --> 01:32:22,090
- Lf I had known company was expected...
- Put some food on the table.

1111
01:32:22,263 --> 01:32:24,254
- Just take a minute.
- We ain't gonna wait no minute.

1112
01:32:29,503 --> 01:32:31,596
Bring out some food.

1113
01:32:49,490 --> 01:32:55,053
<i>Is that what they call a Mona Lisa smile
you got on your puss?</i>

1114
01:32:57,565 --> 01:33:02,366
- Put some food on the table!
- Don't pick on Aunt Rose Comfort.

1115
01:33:02,703 --> 01:33:05,263
Gonna have a talk with that old woman
right here tonight.

1116
01:33:05,439 --> 01:33:07,839
She's outstayed her welcome.

1117
01:33:11,078 --> 01:33:15,139
What a pretty blue ribbon
you're wearing tonight, Mrs. Meighan.

1118
01:33:15,950 --> 01:33:18,078
Why, thank you, Mr. Vacarro.

1119
01:33:18,387 --> 01:33:21,117
There's so many shades of blue.

1120
01:33:21,656 --> 01:33:25,524
- What particular shade is that?
- It's just baby blue.

1121
01:33:28,130 --> 01:33:30,189
Brings out the blue of your eyes.

1122
01:33:30,365 --> 01:33:32,265
Food!

1123
01:33:32,734 --> 01:33:36,397
- Food!
- Immediately. This instant.

1124
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:40,665
This sweater was part
of my trousseau.

1125
01:33:41,276 --> 01:33:42,709
I got all my trousseau...

1126
01:33:42,878 --> 01:33:46,814
...at various department stores in Memphis
where my daddy was known.

1127
01:33:47,416 --> 01:33:49,577
What is this stuff, grass?

1128
01:33:49,751 --> 01:33:52,447
It's greens. Don't you know greens
when you see them?

1129
01:33:52,621 --> 01:33:55,715
Big department stores on Main Street.

1130
01:33:56,091 --> 01:33:59,686
- This stuff is greens?
- Archie Lee dotes on greens.

1131
01:33:59,861 --> 01:34:01,954
- Don't you, Archie Lee?
- No, I don't.

1132
01:34:02,130 --> 01:34:04,963
You don't?
You don't dote on greens?

1133
01:34:05,133 --> 01:34:07,533
- Well, somebody did.
- Somebody probably did.

1134
01:34:07,702 --> 01:34:10,694
Sometime, somewhere,
but that don't mean it was me.

1135
01:34:10,872 --> 01:34:14,865
Eat your greens, big shot.
Greens put iron in the blood.

1136
01:34:15,043 --> 01:34:17,011
I thought Archie Lee doted on greens.

1137
01:34:17,179 --> 01:34:20,842
All these likes and dislikes
are hard to keep straight in your head.

1138
01:34:21,016 --> 01:34:25,214
- Archie Lee is easy to cook for.
- Take this slop off the table.

1139
01:34:25,755 --> 01:34:30,556
I'll cook you some eggs Birmingham.
These greens didn't cook enough.

1140
01:34:30,793 --> 01:34:33,660
I played a fool trick with my stove. I...

1141
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:36,060
I forgot to light it.

1142
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:40,667
When I went out to the store,
I left my greens on the stove.

1143
01:34:40,837 --> 01:34:42,464
I thought they were boiling.

1144
01:34:42,638 --> 01:34:46,438
When I came home,
I discovered my stove wasn't lighted.

1145
01:34:46,609 --> 01:34:48,099
Why do you say "my stove"?

1146
01:34:48,277 --> 01:34:51,508
- Why is everything "mine"?
- Archie Lee, I think you've been drinking.

1147
01:34:52,115 --> 01:34:55,516
You stay out of this.
Sit down, Aunt Rose.

1148
01:34:57,019 --> 01:35:00,352
- What was that, Archie Lee?
- Sit down.

1149
01:35:00,623 --> 01:35:02,056
Where?

1150
01:35:07,163 --> 01:35:08,630
Sit down.

1151
01:35:16,839 --> 01:35:19,000
I'm gonna ask you a question.

1152
01:35:22,111 --> 01:35:24,602
What sort of plans have you made?

1153
01:35:25,214 --> 01:35:28,047
What plans, Archie Lee?
What sort of plans do you mean?

1154
01:35:28,217 --> 01:35:29,445
Plans for the future.

1155
01:35:29,685 --> 01:35:33,486
Archie Lee, I don't think this discussion
is necessary in front of company.

1156
01:35:33,657 --> 01:35:37,684
Mrs. Meighan, when someone
feels uncomfortable over something...

1157
01:35:37,861 --> 01:35:41,228
...it often happens he takes out
his annoyance...

1158
01:35:41,398 --> 01:35:44,799
...on some completely innocent person.

1159
01:35:55,812 --> 01:35:57,302
Now, Aunt Rose...

1160
01:35:58,015 --> 01:36:01,815
...you've been here since August.
And that's a mighty long stay.

1161
01:36:05,255 --> 01:36:08,622
And it's my honest opinion
that you're in need of a rest.

1162
01:36:08,792 --> 01:36:13,525
You've been cooking around here and
cooking around there for how long now?

1163
01:36:14,932 --> 01:36:16,263
Well?

1164
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:19,694
How long you been cooking
around people's houses?

1165
01:36:20,337 --> 01:36:26,003
I helped out my relatives, my folks,
whenever they needed me.

1166
01:36:26,176 --> 01:36:30,442
I was always invited,
sometimes begged to cook.

1167
01:36:30,847 --> 01:36:33,247
When babies was expected
or somebody was sick...

1168
01:36:33,417 --> 01:36:37,285
...they called Aunt Rose.
And Aunt Rose was always ready.

1169
01:36:38,255 --> 01:36:42,124
Nobody ever had to put me out.

1170
01:36:44,662 --> 01:36:48,325
Will you gentlemen excuse me
from the dinner table, I...

1171
01:36:50,435 --> 01:36:53,029
I'll run up and pack.

1172
01:36:58,409 --> 01:37:01,242
Miss Rose Comfort, wait.

1173
01:37:03,448 --> 01:37:05,416
I'll drive you home.

1174
01:37:05,583 --> 01:37:08,950
- I don't have nowhere to go.
- Yes, you do.

1175
01:37:09,287 --> 01:37:11,380
I need a cook.

1176
01:37:11,889 --> 01:37:13,618
I'm tired of my own cooking.

1177
01:37:13,791 --> 01:37:18,125
And I am anxious to try those
eggs Birmingham you mentioned.

1178
01:37:18,896 --> 01:37:20,591
Is it a deal?

1179
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:25,592
- Well, I...
- Oh, sure it's a deal, Aunt Rose.

1180
01:37:25,770 --> 01:37:28,603
Mr. Vacarro will be very good to you.

1181
01:37:28,773 --> 01:37:32,004
And you never can tell
about things in the future.

1182
01:37:33,111 --> 01:37:37,377
Well, I'm gonna pack my things.

1183
01:37:55,768 --> 01:37:59,864
Is there anything else around here you
wanna take away with you, Mr. Vacarro?

1184
01:38:04,476 --> 01:38:07,968
- Well, is there?
- Why, yes, Archie Lee.

1185
01:38:08,147 --> 01:38:13,449
Mr. Vacarro noticed that the house
was just full of furniture.

1186
01:38:13,786 --> 01:38:18,348
And he'd like to borrow
about five complete sets of it.

1187
01:39:01,501 --> 01:39:04,595
Colored folks call this pot liquor.

1188
01:39:05,905 --> 01:39:08,601
I love pot liquor.

1189
01:39:10,977 --> 01:39:12,672
Good?

1190
01:39:13,446 --> 01:39:16,540
I'm crazy about pot liquor.

1191
01:39:20,353 --> 01:39:22,014
- Good.
- It's good.

1192
01:39:29,095 --> 01:39:31,723
- Good.
- That's good.

1193
01:39:35,869 --> 01:39:39,828
That old hen was coming in like
she'd been invited to supper.

1194
01:39:49,516 --> 01:39:52,644
You listen to me.
Now, you all listen to me.

1195
01:39:52,819 --> 01:39:54,218
Now, you quit giving those...

1196
01:39:54,387 --> 01:39:57,322
Those looks back and forth
and listen to me.

1197
01:39:57,490 --> 01:39:59,515
Why, you think I'm deaf...

1198
01:39:59,692 --> 01:40:02,718
...and dumb and blind or something,
do you?

1199
01:40:02,996 --> 01:40:05,124
Well, you're mistook.

1200
01:40:05,299 --> 01:40:06,766
Oh, brother.

1201
01:40:06,934 --> 01:40:09,368
Oh, brother,
but you're much, much mistook.

1202
01:40:09,537 --> 01:40:14,065
I know. I know, I guess I look like a...

1203
01:40:14,742 --> 01:40:16,573
I guess I look like...

1204
01:40:16,744 --> 01:40:18,803
What do you guess you look like,
Archie Lee?

1205
01:40:18,979 --> 01:40:21,812
Yeah, some sweet little innocent
Baby Doll of a wife, huh?

1206
01:40:21,982 --> 01:40:26,078
Oh, not ready for marriage, huh?
Oh, no, not ready for marriage...

1207
01:40:26,253 --> 01:40:28,312
...but plenty ready to go out...

1208
01:40:28,489 --> 01:40:31,287
Wait a minute now,
I see how it's funny.

1209
01:40:31,459 --> 01:40:33,017
It sure is funny, isn't it, huh?

1210
01:40:34,562 --> 01:40:38,396
But there's one little teensy-weensy
thing that you've overlooked.

1211
01:40:38,666 --> 01:40:40,634
I got position.

1212
01:40:41,969 --> 01:40:45,302
I got position in this county
where I was born and brought up.

1213
01:40:45,473 --> 01:40:49,000
- Stop it!
- I hold a respected position.

1214
01:40:49,176 --> 01:40:52,907
Lifelong member of every organization
in the delta!

1215
01:40:54,448 --> 01:40:56,575
On my side are friends!

1216
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:58,741
Friends.

1217
01:40:58,919 --> 01:41:02,685
Long-standing business associates,
and social.

1218
01:41:03,524 --> 01:41:05,515
You see what I mean, huh?

1219
01:41:05,693 --> 01:41:08,423
You ain't got that advantage,
have you, mister?

1220
01:41:08,596 --> 01:41:11,225
Well, have you, huh? Have you?

1221
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:13,162
Come on, speak up.

1222
01:41:14,302 --> 01:41:17,567
Ain't you a dago or something?
Excuse me, I mean, Italian or something?

1223
01:41:17,739 --> 01:41:20,708
I was a medical corpsman in the Navy.
You've got an unhealthy look.

1224
01:41:20,876 --> 01:41:23,743
- All I gotta do is get on the phone...
- Call an ambulance.

1225
01:41:23,912 --> 01:41:27,313
I don't have to make a call.
I can handle the situation myself.

1226
01:41:27,482 --> 01:41:32,249
- What situation do you mean?
- Situation I find here under my roof!

1227
01:41:39,494 --> 01:41:41,359
Look here now.

1228
01:41:44,299 --> 01:41:45,630
Oh, I'm not such a...

1229
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:49,327
Such a marble-missing old fool
that I couldn't size it up.

1230
01:41:51,773 --> 01:41:55,174
I sized it up the minute I seen
you was still on this place...

1231
01:41:55,343 --> 01:41:56,901
...and her...

1232
01:41:57,078 --> 01:41:58,375
Oh, her...

1233
01:41:58,547 --> 01:42:02,847
Her with that sly smile on her.
And you with yours on you.

1234
01:42:03,018 --> 01:42:06,545
- I know how to wipe off those sly smiles.
- Meighan!

1235
01:42:07,022 --> 01:42:10,549
You know and I know and I know
that you know that I know...

1236
01:42:10,725 --> 01:42:13,888
...that you set fire to my cotton gin
last night.

1237
01:42:14,062 --> 01:42:17,259
You burned down the Syndicate Gin.

1238
01:42:17,432 --> 01:42:21,028
And I got here in my hand
a signed affidavit...

1239
01:42:21,203 --> 01:42:23,694
...a paper signed by a witness...

1240
01:42:23,873 --> 01:42:28,572
...whose testimony will hold up even in
the law courts of Tiger Tail County.

1241
01:42:28,744 --> 01:42:32,145
That's what I come here for
and that's all I got.

1242
01:42:32,315 --> 01:42:37,275
Whatever else you suspect,
well, you're mistaken.

1243
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:40,114
Isn't that so, Mrs. Meighan?
Isn't your husband mistaken...

1244
01:42:40,289 --> 01:42:43,156
...in thinking I got anything
but this signed affidavit...

1245
01:42:43,326 --> 01:42:46,762
...which was the purpose
of my all-afternoon call?

1246
01:42:47,797 --> 01:42:50,163
I'm foreign, Meighan...

1247
01:42:50,333 --> 01:42:54,667
...but not revengeful,
at least not more than is rightful.

1248
01:42:55,371 --> 01:42:58,602
Now, we got a workable
good-neighbor policy between us.

1249
01:42:58,774 --> 01:43:03,108
It might work out.
Anyhow, I think it deserves a try.

1250
01:43:03,279 --> 01:43:06,339
Now, as to the other side of the situation,
which I won't mention...

1251
01:43:06,515 --> 01:43:10,747
...well, all I can say is
a certain attraction exists.

1252
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:12,353
Mutually, I believe.

1253
01:43:12,521 --> 01:43:15,854
I needed a little shuteye
after last night's excitement.

1254
01:43:16,025 --> 01:43:20,587
And I have a faint recollection
of being sung to by someone.

1255
01:43:21,197 --> 01:43:23,597
A lullaby song that was sweet...

1256
01:43:23,766 --> 01:43:26,736
...and a touch of cool fingers.

1257
01:43:27,437 --> 01:43:30,463
- You think I'm gonna put up with this?
- But that's all, absolutely.

1258
01:43:30,641 --> 01:43:33,508
- You think I'm gonna put up...?
- With this situation?

1259
01:43:33,677 --> 01:43:36,976
You went to whole lot of risk
and trouble to get my business back.

1260
01:43:37,147 --> 01:43:38,409
- Cool.
- Don't you want it?

1261
01:43:38,582 --> 01:43:40,880
- Yeah, cool.
- It's up to you, Archie.

1262
01:43:41,051 --> 01:43:43,611
- Very cool.
- It's up to you.

1263
01:43:43,854 --> 01:43:46,516
- You just fixed your wagon.
- Yeah.

1264
01:43:46,790 --> 01:43:50,954
With this smart talk,
oh, you just fixed your wagon.

1265
01:43:51,128 --> 01:43:54,894
I'm gonna wipe that grin off
your greasy wop face for good.

1266
01:43:55,065 --> 01:43:57,761
Oh, you just... You watch.

1267
01:43:59,403 --> 01:44:02,998
Is my wop face greasy, Mrs. Meighan?

1268
01:44:31,234 --> 01:44:35,262
That's the last time you're ever gonna lay
your hands on me again, you stinker!

1269
01:44:35,673 --> 01:44:38,267
You stinking stinker! Stinker!

1270
01:44:38,643 --> 01:44:41,043
Look out, Silva!

1271
01:44:43,781 --> 01:44:45,146
Rock?

1272
01:44:45,650 --> 01:44:47,083
Rock, where are you?

1273
01:44:48,386 --> 01:44:51,446
Where are you, Vacarro?
Where are you?

1274
01:44:58,596 --> 01:44:59,927
Where you hiding, wop?

1275
01:45:00,231 --> 01:45:03,723
Oh, if you're under there,
you ain't getting out.

1276
01:45:10,875 --> 01:45:13,537
Look, my husband's got a gun,
and I just don't know...

1277
01:45:24,255 --> 01:45:25,586
Hey, wop!

1278
01:45:25,757 --> 01:45:27,725
Oh, you yellow-bellied wop.

1279
01:45:36,801 --> 01:45:40,328
Get that gun!
Get that gun away from him!

1280
01:45:49,982 --> 01:45:51,745
Help! Help!

1281
01:45:52,751 --> 01:45:56,653
Where's that wop?
You can't get away!

1282
01:46:02,127 --> 01:46:04,095
Go away from me!

1283
01:46:04,830 --> 01:46:08,357
Get away!
Where are you, Vacarro?

1284
01:46:08,534 --> 01:46:10,001
Right here, neighbor.

1285
01:46:15,741 --> 01:46:17,470
There you are.

1286
01:46:23,148 --> 01:46:25,946
Oh, it's you. Excuse me.

1287
01:46:27,119 --> 01:46:28,711
Silva?

1288
01:46:30,088 --> 01:46:32,386
Here. Here.

1289
01:46:32,558 --> 01:46:34,958
Where are you, Vacarro?

1290
01:46:35,427 --> 01:46:37,088
Come on.

1291
01:46:38,163 --> 01:46:40,893
You yellow-bellied wop!

1292
01:46:43,735 --> 01:46:45,726
Baby Doll!

1293
01:46:50,677 --> 01:46:53,237
Where are you, Vacarro?

1294
01:46:54,714 --> 01:46:57,205
Where are you, Vacarro?

1295
01:46:59,285 --> 01:47:01,810
Vacarro!

1296
01:47:04,057 --> 01:47:06,719
Come on out, Vacarro!

1297
01:47:07,727 --> 01:47:10,218
Now, you put that gun of yours away!

1298
01:47:30,383 --> 01:47:33,011
Baby Doll!

1299
01:47:33,186 --> 01:47:34,847
Baby.

1300
01:47:36,389 --> 01:47:39,825
Baby Doll.

1301
01:47:39,993 --> 01:47:42,257
Baby Doll.

1302
01:47:43,863 --> 01:47:46,593
Baby Doll.

1303
01:47:47,133 --> 01:47:49,363
Baby Doll.

1304
01:47:55,876 --> 01:47:58,845
Oh, Vacarro, where?

1305
01:47:59,179 --> 01:48:02,671
Where are you, you wop?

1306
01:48:12,226 --> 01:48:14,194
Baby Doll.

1307
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:22,464
No. No.

1308
01:48:23,203 --> 01:48:25,501
No, Baby Doll.

1309
01:48:28,475 --> 01:48:32,138
Baby Doll. No, no, no.

1310
01:48:33,747 --> 01:48:37,046
No, no, no.

1311
01:48:45,592 --> 01:48:48,925
No. No, no, no.

1312
01:48:53,067 --> 01:48:55,092
Baby Doll.

1313
01:49:10,852 --> 01:49:13,685
Hurry. All ready to go.

1314
01:49:17,325 --> 01:49:19,225
Now, who is that?

1315
01:49:19,995 --> 01:49:21,986
What's the matter, Sandy?
Is something wrong?

1316
01:49:22,163 --> 01:49:26,463
I'm running for town marshal
for the 25th term, and I want your vote.

1317
01:49:26,634 --> 01:49:31,128
- You got my vote, Sandy.
- Let me see your gun, fella. Let me see it.

1318
01:49:32,073 --> 01:49:34,974
Doggone, man.
You're too old for a job like that.

1319
01:49:35,143 --> 01:49:39,011
I'm 20 years younger than you
and I wouldn't run for a job like that.

1320
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:40,943
Age is a factor calls for recognition.

1321
01:49:41,116 --> 01:49:43,949
I hope you recognize the fact
it calls for recognition.

1322
01:49:44,119 --> 01:49:45,711
You know...

1323
01:49:46,221 --> 01:49:48,018
...a man grows old suddenly.

1324
01:49:48,189 --> 01:49:52,285
Not gradual, just all of a sudden
he's old.

1325
01:49:53,395 --> 01:49:56,057
Hey, now, wait a minute,
where you guys taking me?

1326
01:49:56,231 --> 01:49:58,199
You're acting as though
I'm under arrest.

1327
01:49:58,366 --> 01:50:00,800
- Well, you been shoot...
- There he is!

1328
01:50:03,171 --> 01:50:05,366
Come on! Come on!

1329
01:50:05,540 --> 01:50:07,974
Get off! Get off me!

1330
01:50:08,643 --> 01:50:11,408
Come on. Come on.

1331
01:50:16,652 --> 01:50:19,280
Hey, how about me?

1332
01:50:19,722 --> 01:50:21,485
Put the handcuffs on him.

1333
01:50:22,358 --> 01:50:24,849
Okay. Okay.

1334
01:50:25,027 --> 01:50:28,121
Put me in that stinking black calaboose.
I ain't a white man?

1335
01:50:28,297 --> 01:50:31,357
No, I ain't a white man,
so throw me in.

1336
01:50:31,534 --> 01:50:33,729
But don't you leave
my Baby Doll here with him.

1337
01:50:34,103 --> 01:50:36,003
Don't you leave him here with her.

1338
01:50:36,172 --> 01:50:37,400
Sandy...

1339
01:50:37,573 --> 01:50:39,768
...listen, you're a married man.

1340
01:50:39,942 --> 01:50:43,207
You understand how I feel,
don't you, Sandy?

1341
01:50:43,379 --> 01:50:46,906
Please, as one white man to another.

1342
01:50:47,249 --> 01:50:50,776
Just for tonight,
don't leave him on the place.

1343
01:50:50,953 --> 01:50:52,648
Just tonight, Sandy.

1344
01:50:56,826 --> 01:50:59,294
Scratched my leg
on the bark of that tree.

1345
01:50:59,762 --> 01:51:03,061
- Vacarro, come here.
- Excuse me.

1346
01:51:05,367 --> 01:51:06,994
Now, what you got on your mind?

1347
01:51:07,169 --> 01:51:10,730
Listen, fella, we ain't got nothing
to hold that old boy on.

1348
01:51:10,906 --> 01:51:14,774
He's been shooting up his yard. But he tells
us a varmint's been catching his chickens.

1349
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:16,172
His chickens?

1350
01:51:16,345 --> 01:51:20,009
I got a signed confession by a material
witness that amounts to an affidavit.

1351
01:51:20,183 --> 01:51:22,310
- Let's see.
- Not till it's witnessed by others.

1352
01:51:22,486 --> 01:51:23,783
We'll have it witnessed.

1353
01:51:23,954 --> 01:51:27,856
I don't need or want anything from you.
I'm going to the county sheriff.

1354
01:51:28,425 --> 01:51:32,088
- Rock!
- Here, Silva, here.

1355
01:51:33,864 --> 01:51:38,233
- Hey, Silva, how about me?
- Now?

1356
01:51:40,737 --> 01:51:44,434
Well, I'll be coming back tomorrow
with lots more cotton.

1357
01:51:45,609 --> 01:51:47,804
I'll be back tomorrow
with lots more cotton!

1358
01:51:47,978 --> 01:51:50,947
I'll be back tomorrow
with lots more cotton to gin.

1359
01:51:51,114 --> 01:51:53,014
Early in the morning
with lots more cotton.

1360
01:51:53,550 --> 01:51:56,644
Early in the morning
with lots more cotton.

1361
01:52:02,459 --> 01:52:05,155
- Well, he's gone.
- What happens now?

1362
01:52:05,328 --> 01:52:09,059
Well, he sure enough got hisself
a signed confession from your wife.

1363
01:52:09,232 --> 01:52:12,133
We're gonna have to go through this thing
for appearance's sake.

1364
01:52:12,435 --> 01:52:14,699
I don't mean that, I mean...

1365
01:52:18,108 --> 01:52:20,133
...what happens tomorrow?

1366
01:52:21,044 --> 01:52:24,980
Well, the town marshal has no control
over tomorrow.

1367
01:52:47,738 --> 01:52:50,366
Today's my Baby Doll's birthday.

1368
01:52:58,082 --> 01:53:00,346
Your friend forgot me.

1369
01:53:03,187 --> 01:53:07,647
Well, Archie Lee,
it looks like the celebration is over.

1370
01:53:07,825 --> 01:53:09,383
Let's go.

1371
01:53:10,995 --> 01:53:13,930
He's coming back tomorrow
with more cotton.

1372
01:53:14,098 --> 01:53:16,157
He's coming back?

1373
01:53:34,453 --> 01:53:36,751
Well, let's go in now.

1374
01:53:38,824 --> 01:53:42,817
We got nothing to do
but wait for tomorrow.

1375
01:53:43,762 --> 01:53:45,525
And see...

1376
01:53:45,998 --> 01:53:50,264
...if we're remembered
or forgotten.

1377
01:54:06,952 --> 01:54:09,944
Oh, my. Oh, my.
