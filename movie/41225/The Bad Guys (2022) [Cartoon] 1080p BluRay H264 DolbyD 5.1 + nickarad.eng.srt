I got to say,
you really got us pegged.

674

Sadly, we were never

to be anything more
than second-rate criminals.

If only there was someone
who could help

Best thing is to just
throw us in jail

for the rest
of our hopeless lives.

688

Yeah, that's the plan.

But how can we say
they're hopeless

698
00:29:14,604 --> 00:29:16,807
if they've never
been given a chance?

699
00:29:16,941 --> 00:29:19,910
What if... what if we tried
a little experiment, Diane?

700
00:29:20,044 --> 00:29:22,546
As you know,
my Gala for Goodness,

701
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:26,383
the "hashtag charity event
of the year," is coming up.

702

If I can prove
to everyone at that gala

703
00:29:28,385 --> 00:29:29,787
that the Bad Guys have changed,

704
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,422
will you set them free
and give them a clean start?

705
00:29:32,556 --> 00:29:33,858
(crowd gasping, murmuring)

706

- WOLF: Ow!

707
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:38,428
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't you see what he's doing?

708
00:29:38,562 --> 00:29:40,064
He's playing you.

709
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:41,265
But it was my idea.

710
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:42,532
It was his idea.

711
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:44,534
But only because
you made him have it.

712
00:29:44,668 --> 00:29:46,871
Madam Governor,
you can't just let them go.

713
00:29:47,004 --> 00:29:49,273
Professor, I'm not about to put
the safety of the city

714
00:29:49,406 --> 00:29:51,341
on the line for an experiment.

715
00:29:51,475 --> 00:29:52,977
Excuse me, Madam Governor.

716
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:56,713
I seem to remember that
a wise person once said,

717
00:29:56,847 --> 00:30:01,051
"Even trash can be recycled
into something beautiful."

718

(chuckles softly)

719
00:30:04,688 --> 00:30:05,990
Okay. I'm game.

720
00:30:06,123 --> 00:30:08,658
But only because it's you,
Professor.

721
00:30:08,793 --> 00:30:09,894
No!

722
00:30:10,027 --> 00:30:12,096
We'll hold on to the Dolphin
until the gala.

723
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:15,499
Just to remove
any unnecessary temptation.

724
00:30:15,632 --> 00:30:17,667
Of course. Good thinking.

725
00:30:17,802 --> 00:30:19,736
That's why you're governor.

726
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:22,139
Now that everyone's happy...

727
00:30:22,272 --> 00:30:23,607
Not happy.

729

Oh, that. (chuckles)

I-I-I'm sorry.

Uh, you totally lost me.

I told him to stop drinking
out of the toilet.

746

Hey, did you get hit
on the head?

747
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:15,759
What? No, I didn't
get hit on the head.

748
00:31:15,893 --> 00:31:17,461
My cousin got hit on
the head with an anchor,

he only swam in a circle.

you're not following me.

We're gonna pretend to go good.

752

Just a few days with Marmalade.

753

The Golden Dolphin.

You got it.

Since when do we not
finish a job?

The Bad Guys become

remorseless sociopaths.

801
00:33:21,185 --> 00:33:23,253
Oh, stop.
You're making me blush.

802
00:33:23,387 --> 00:33:25,122
But inside, there's a flower...

803
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:28,092
the flower of goodness...
and when it blooms

804
00:33:28,225 --> 00:33:30,627
and you feel that tingle
of positivity

805
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,262
radiating through your body,

806
00:33:32,396 --> 00:33:35,465
you're going to want to feel it
all the time.

807
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,267
So we're going for a tingle?

808
00:33:37,401 --> 00:33:38,602
Not any tingle.

809
00:33:38,735 --> 00:33:40,837
The tingle of goodness,
which you'll feel

810

Sharing Laboratory.

811
00:33:44,341 --> 00:33:48,245
Okay, Mr. Snake, I'm going
to give you a Push Pop.

812
00:33:48,378 --> 00:33:50,814
Great! Push Pop just for me!

813
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:53,550
- No, to share.
- Why?

814
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:55,552
Well, on a fundamental level,

815
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:57,654
it's about putting
someone else's needs

816
00:33:57,787 --> 00:34:00,124
- ahead of your own.
- (chuckling)

817

All right, all right.

This is going to taste
extra sweet,

821

'cause I know how bad
you want it.

It's yummy. Mm.

SNAKE (echoing):
Totally worth it.

831

Well, that's terrifying.

832
00:34:32,156 --> 00:34:34,091
Let's try something simpler.

833

pays attention

Hey, look.
It's a cat stuck in a tree.

848
00:35:10,327 --> 00:35:12,329
It doesn't get much simpler
than that.

849
00:35:12,462 --> 00:35:14,364
Now, what in this scenario

850
00:35:14,498 --> 00:35:16,400
would give you that good tingle?

851

we did change,

A wolf and a fox
are not so different.

Maybe they will believe you,
maybe they won't,

1118
00:46:08,617 --> 00:46:11,955
is the Bad Guys, whose
heart-melting rescue video

1119
00:46:12,088 --> 00:46:15,925
has made them an overnight
viral sensation.

1120
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,395
All right, guys,
this is the big one.

1121
00:46:19,528 --> 00:46:21,130
The Golden Dolphin

1122
00:46:21,264 --> 00:46:22,732
is inside a titanium case

1123
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:24,700
controlled by a randomly
generated five-digit code,

1124
00:46:24,834 --> 00:46:26,369
a code kept safe and secure

1125
00:46:26,502 --> 00:46:29,405
inside a briefcase handcuffed
to the chief of police.

1126
00:46:29,538 --> 00:46:31,407
PIRANHA:
She's not messing around.

1127
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,109
WOLF: The code is only
accessible with

1128
00:46:33,242 --> 00:46:34,844
- her authorized fingerprints.
- SNAKE: Leave that to me.

1129
00:46:34,978 --> 00:46:36,913
WOLF:
While Snake gets the code,

1130
00:46:37,046 --> 00:46:38,414
Shark will secure
the fake Dolphin.

1131
00:46:38,547 --> 00:46:40,149
SHARK:
I like the sound of that.

1132
00:46:40,283 --> 00:46:42,018
WOLF: Meanwhile, the rest of us
plant circuit jammers.

1133
00:46:42,151 --> 00:46:44,120
TARANTULA: Allowing me
to hack into the power grid.

1134
00:46:44,253 --> 00:46:45,822
WOLF: At the end of the night,
we toast the professor,

1135
00:46:45,955 --> 00:46:47,857
"Blah-blah-blah, yada yada,"

1136
00:46:47,991 --> 00:46:50,393
and when I say "Marmalade,"
lights go out,

1137
00:46:50,526 --> 00:46:53,329
and we'll have exactly
four seconds to make our move.

1138
00:46:53,462 --> 00:46:55,364
SNAKE:
The old switcheroo.

1139
00:46:55,498 --> 00:46:58,167
WOLF: Chief hands Marmalade
the fake Dolphin,

1140
00:46:58,301 --> 00:47:01,270
we get our pardon, applause,
applause, exit stage right,

1141
00:47:01,404 --> 00:47:03,873
and by the time they realize
what happened...

1142
00:47:04,007 --> 00:47:05,574
(over speakers):
So long, suckers!

1143
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:07,343
...we'll be driving off
into the sunset,

1144
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:08,644
legacy cemented.

1145
00:47:08,778 --> 00:47:10,113
- (laughter)
- PIRANHA: Nice.

1146
00:47:10,246 --> 00:47:11,514
Got to hand it to you, buddy.

1147
00:47:11,647 --> 00:47:13,582
You're a real artist.

1148
00:47:16,185 --> 00:47:18,121
Well, Good Guys, this is it.

1149
00:47:18,254 --> 00:47:19,655
Good luck out there.

- What's that sound?

1155
00:47:37,573 --> 00:47:39,642
Like screaming
but not terrified.

1156

00:52:51,687 --> 00:52:53,356
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Wolf.

As you know,
the money raised tonight

1284
00:52:55,191 --> 00:52:58,194
will be delivered tomorrow
to schools, hospitals

1285
00:52:58,327 --> 00:53:00,363
and other worthy causes
across the city.

Uh... (clears throat)

1288
00:53:04,032 --> 00:53:07,069
I just want to take
a moment to recognize

1289
00:53:07,203 --> 00:53:09,338
the one responsible
for our new outlook.

1290
00:53:09,472 --> 00:53:11,974
Our brilliant mentor,

1291
00:53:12,107 --> 00:53:13,709
- a paragon of enlightenment...
- Do it. - Come on.

1292
00:53:13,842 --> 00:53:16,845
...the one and only
Professor...

1293
00:53:19,482 --> 00:53:21,650
- TARANTULA: Wolf, do it.
- WOLF: ...uh, Professor...

1294
00:53:21,784 --> 00:53:23,051
(hisses)

1295
00:53:23,186 --> 00:53:25,388

1296
00:53:27,223 --> 00:53:29,358

(cheering)

1298
00:53:32,027 --> 00:53:34,297
Chief, may I do the honors?

1299
00:53:37,466 --> 00:53:38,601
That's not the plan.

1300
00:53:38,734 --> 00:53:39,768
What is happening?

1301
00:53:39,902 --> 00:53:41,304
He's gone rogue.

1302
00:53:42,771 --> 00:53:44,607
A deal's a deal.

1303
00:53:45,641 --> 00:53:48,477
By the power vested in me,
it is a pleasure

1304
00:53:48,611 --> 00:53:51,113
to grant the Bad Guys
a full par...

1305
00:53:51,247 --> 00:53:53,482
(guests gasping, murmuring)

1306
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:57,720
- That was weird.
- MAN: The meteorite is gone!

1307
00:53:57,853 --> 00:53:59,222
Somebody stole it!

1308
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:03,192
- (chief groans)
- Chief.

1309
00:54:03,326 --> 00:54:05,194
- Wolf. (growls)
- Come on.

1310
00:54:05,328 --> 00:54:06,962
You can't possibly think
that we did this.

1311
00:54:07,095 --> 00:54:09,298
(over speakers):
So long, suckers!

1312
00:54:10,399 --> 00:54:11,800
Run!

1313
00:54:11,934 --> 00:54:13,269
Get them!

- (officers grunting)

1317
00:54:26,715 --> 00:54:28,384
Here. Here.

1318
00:54:28,517 --> 00:54:31,086
- What are you doing?
- I'm giving it all back.

1319
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,321
Huh?

1320
00:54:32,455 --> 00:54:34,523
- (clamoring)
- Excuse me.

1321
00:54:34,657 --> 00:54:36,692
(panting, grunting)

1322
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,062
- What happened back there?
- I couldn't do it.

1323
00:54:40,195 --> 00:54:41,930
What do you mean,
you couldn't do it?

1324
00:54:42,064 --> 00:54:43,332
- I-I-I just... I...
- No!

1325
00:54:43,466 --> 00:54:45,768
- I do not run.
- OFFICERS: Hut, hut, hut...

1326
00:54:45,901 --> 00:54:47,570
That is not how I roll.

1327
00:54:47,703 --> 00:54:49,505
Piranha,
don't do anything crazy.

1328
00:54:49,638 --> 00:54:50,973
(laughing)

1329
00:54:51,106 --> 00:54:54,410
Crazy is what I bring
to the party, chico.

1330
00:54:58,747 --> 00:55:00,916
(Shark groans)

1331
00:55:02,285 --> 00:55:03,652
Hey, you're making a mistake.

1332
00:55:03,786 --> 00:55:04,753
We didn't do it.

1333
00:55:04,887 --> 00:55:06,021
I know we always say that,

1334
00:55:06,154 --> 00:55:07,222
but this time
it's actually true.

1335
00:55:07,356 --> 00:55:09,224
A-la-la-la-la. Can't hear you.

1336
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:11,460
- Guilty, guilty, guilty.
- Talk to Marmalade.

1337
00:55:11,594 --> 00:55:13,396
We're really good now.
He'll tell you.

1338
00:55:13,529 --> 00:55:14,630
Professor!

1339
00:55:14,763 --> 00:55:17,032
Tonight's headline:
Change is impossible.

1340
00:55:17,165 --> 00:55:19,034
You should always judge
a book by its cover,

1341
00:55:19,167 --> 00:55:21,404
and all stereotypes
have been affirmed.

1342
00:55:21,537 --> 00:55:23,138
MARMALADE:
Stop, for goodness' sake!

1343
00:55:23,272 --> 00:55:24,573
Let me speak to them.

1344
00:55:24,707 --> 00:55:27,242
I'm-I'm sure there's been
some misunderstanding.

1345
00:55:28,043 --> 00:55:30,178
- (door opens)
- Ah, Professor Marmalade.

1346
00:55:30,313 --> 00:55:31,680
You've got five minutes.

1347
00:55:31,814 --> 00:55:33,816
No deals this time.

1348
00:55:33,949 --> 00:55:34,983
Y-You have to help us.

1349
00:55:35,117 --> 00:55:36,652
Tell 'em.
Tell 'em we didn't do it.

1350
00:55:36,785 --> 00:55:38,654
There, there.
Of course you didn't do it.

1351
00:55:38,787 --> 00:55:39,922
How could you?

1352
00:55:40,055 --> 00:55:43,426
After all,
you're such a good boy.

1353
00:55:44,226 --> 00:55:47,596
You're such a good boy.

1354
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:49,432
That shiver up my spine.

1355
00:55:49,565 --> 00:55:51,800
The wag in my tiny tail.

1356
00:55:51,934 --> 00:55:53,168
Arrest them!

1357
00:55:53,302 --> 00:55:55,070
What if we tried
a little experiment, Diane?

1358
00:55:55,203 --> 00:55:57,506
As you know,
my Gala for Goodness...

1359

TIFFANY: Where the legendary
Love Crater Meteorite

1360
00:56:00,008 --> 00:56:02,545
will be on display
for the first time ever.

1361
00:56:02,678 --> 00:56:05,981
All eyes will be
on you tonight, not me.

1362
00:56:06,815 --> 00:56:08,050
WOMAN:
You're such a...

1363
00:56:08,183 --> 00:56:10,486
MARMALADE:
Good boy.

1364
00:56:11,487 --> 00:56:12,888
You.

1365
00:56:13,021 --> 00:56:14,590
It was all you.

1366
00:56:14,723 --> 00:56:16,124
What are you talking about,
Wolf?

1367
00:56:16,258 --> 00:56:17,526
The old lady,
the Golden Dolphin,

1368
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:19,395
good training...
it was all to get us here,

1369
00:56:19,528 --> 00:56:21,764
so he could steal the meteorite
and let us take the fall.

1370
00:56:21,897 --> 00:56:23,566
Whoa. Whoa, what old lady?

1371
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:26,201
And-and why would a guinea pig
want a meteorite anyway?

1372
00:56:26,335 --> 00:56:29,104
(Marmalade chuckling)

1373
00:56:29,237 --> 00:56:32,040
Uh, guys, he's creeping me out.

1374
00:56:32,174 --> 00:56:33,776
Wait, what? What's going on?

1375
00:56:33,909 --> 00:56:35,177
Someone turn me around.

1376
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:36,945
MARMALADE:
Well, well.

1377
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:38,981
So, you finally get it.

1378
00:56:39,114 --> 00:56:40,516
- Wait.
- What?

1379
00:56:40,649 --> 00:56:42,117
You stole the meteorite?

1380
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:44,219
Oh, it's not just a meteorite.

1381
00:56:44,353 --> 00:56:45,788
I told you guys it's a butt.

1382
00:56:45,921 --> 00:56:47,122
It's not a butt!

1383
00:56:47,255 --> 00:56:48,457
(takes deep breath)

1384
00:56:48,591 --> 00:56:51,059
It's the ultimate power source.

1385
00:56:51,193 --> 00:56:54,062
You see, when it struck,
scientists found that

1386
00:56:54,196 --> 00:56:55,931
it emitted
an electromagnetic frequency

1387
00:56:56,064 --> 00:56:58,000
unlike anything else on Earth.

1388
00:56:58,133 --> 00:56:59,802
I'm going to harness its power

1389
00:56:59,935 --> 00:57:03,138
to pull off the greatest heist
the world has ever seen.

1390
00:57:03,939 --> 00:57:05,874
You should've eaten him
when you had the chance.

1391
00:57:06,008 --> 00:57:07,476
- Yep.
- But why us?

1392
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:09,845
Because you're
the perfect patsies.

1393
00:57:09,978 --> 00:57:13,449
Come on, when people look up
"bad" in the dictionary,

1394
00:57:13,582 --> 00:57:16,051
do they see a sweet,
adorable guinea pig?

1395
00:57:16,184 --> 00:57:18,053
No. They see you.

1396
00:57:18,186 --> 00:57:20,423
And they always will.

1397
00:57:20,556 --> 00:57:21,824
Okay, fine.

1398
00:57:21,957 --> 00:57:23,225
But you set us up.

1399
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:24,627
(chuckling):
Oh, pish-pish.

1400
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,596
Let's be honest...
evolution set you up.

1401
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:29,932
But Wolfie here
really clinched it.

1402
00:57:30,065 --> 00:57:32,868
You fell for every one
of my traps,

1403
00:57:33,001 --> 00:57:36,805
starting with saving
a helpless little old lady.

1404
00:57:36,939 --> 00:57:40,108
Wolf, what's he talking about?

1405
00:57:42,377 --> 00:57:43,912
MARMALADE:
Whoops.

1406
00:57:44,046 --> 00:57:46,782
Did I say too much?

1407
00:57:46,915 --> 00:57:49,251
Anyhoo, looks like, yet again,

1408
00:57:49,384 --> 00:57:53,021
the Big Bad Wolf got outsmarted
by a little piggy.

1409
00:57:53,155 --> 00:57:55,991
You little pouchy-cheeked rat!

1410
00:57:56,124 --> 00:57:57,526
I'll kill you! You hear me?

1411
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,795
- You're dead! You're de...
- Help! Help! Help!

1412

The Big Bad Wolf
is attacking me.

forever, Wolf!

on how the Bad Guys managed

1417
00:58:17,513 --> 00:58:19,915
to steal the meteorite
in plain sight?

1418
00:58:20,048 --> 00:58:21,283
Well, off the top of my head,

1419
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:23,151
perhaps they accessed the site
previously

1420
00:58:23,285 --> 00:58:24,553
and set up an intricate system

1421

to suck the meteorite down
into a holding area,

us conning Marmalade.

- (camera shutter snaps)

and not just steal it?

1448
01:00:03,952 --> 01:00:07,189
I was trying to steal the purse
when the old lady fell and...

1449
01:00:07,322 --> 01:00:09,291
(clears throat)
I kind of helped her.

I saved the old lady,
and she hugged me,

1455
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,003
and my tail wagged,
and I didn't know what it was,

1456
01:00:21,136 --> 01:00:24,506
but it felt, uh,
you know... good.

Hey. You okay?

No, I'm not okay.

1593

I'm very, very un-okay.

(grumbles)

1595
01:07:01,369 --> 01:07:03,238
Just left the only friends
I have ever had,

1596
01:07:03,371 --> 01:07:06,708
so what am I... (sighs)
what am I doing?

1597
01:07:07,609 --> 01:07:09,377
(sighs)

1598
01:07:09,511 --> 01:07:12,314
I know this isn't easy,

1599
01:07:12,447 --> 01:07:14,582
leaving everything behind.

1600
01:07:14,716 --> 01:07:16,051
- Do you?
- Yeah.

1601
01:07:16,184 --> 01:07:18,520
I was the best thief
in the world.

1602
01:07:18,653 --> 01:07:22,524
Fast, fearless, inventive.

1603
01:07:22,657 --> 01:07:25,493
I just had one thing
left to steal.

1604
01:07:25,627 --> 01:07:27,262
The Golden Dolphin.

1605
01:07:27,395 --> 01:07:29,264
So you went after it.

1606
01:07:29,397 --> 01:07:31,266
I didn't just go after it.

1607
01:07:32,434 --> 01:07:34,336
I had it.

1608
01:07:34,469 --> 01:07:36,704
And a clear escape route.

1609
01:07:39,274 --> 01:07:41,243
But...

1610
01:07:41,376 --> 01:07:43,878
all I saw in the end
was the tricky fox

1611
01:07:44,012 --> 01:07:46,781
that they always told me I was.

1612
01:07:47,815 --> 01:07:50,018
It changed everything.

1613
01:07:50,152 --> 01:07:52,620
So, now,
instead of hurting people,

1614
01:07:52,754 --> 01:07:54,322
I'm helping them. (sighs)

1615
01:07:54,456 --> 01:07:56,024
I'm still me. (chuckles)

I'm just me on the right side.

You're doing the right thing.

And someday your friends,

I think they'll understand.

There are no obvious targets.

This is your moment, Chief.

2067
01:26:48,922 --> 01:26:50,157
Drink it in.

2068
01:26:50,291 --> 01:26:51,425
(gasps) Wow.

2069
01:26:51,558 --> 01:26:52,893
You know, I should...
I should give a speech.

2070
01:26:53,026 --> 01:26:54,161
I... Well, I-I should,
shouldn't I?

2071
01:26:54,295 --> 01:26:55,996
- Uh... (mutters)
- (chief clears throat)

2072
01:26:56,129 --> 01:26:57,431
When I was six years old,

2073
01:26:57,564 --> 01:26:59,200
I decided that I wanted
to play the piccolo,

2074
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:01,168
only to find that
my fingers were just

2075
01:27:01,302 --> 01:27:04,004
too powerful for that
fragile little instrument.

2076
01:27:04,137 --> 01:27:06,607
And that's when I discovered
law enforcement.

2077
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:08,141
- (chuckles)
- (chief continues indistinctly)

2078
01:27:08,275 --> 01:27:09,943
I'm proud of you, Wolf.

2079
01:27:10,076 --> 01:27:13,280
You know, a fox and a wolf
are not that different.

2080
01:27:13,414 --> 01:27:15,349
You got a good thing
going here, Governor.

2081
01:27:15,482 --> 01:27:17,618
So, it turns out the saga
of the Bad Guys

2082
01:27:17,751 --> 01:27:21,255
has come to a simple and
totally satisfying conclusion.

2083
01:27:21,388 --> 01:27:24,090
Though I wonder,
what happened to the meteorite?

2084
01:27:24,225 --> 01:27:26,026
MARMALADE:
Cuddles! Faster, faster!

2085
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:27,728
TIFFANY:
It's Professor Marmalade!

2086
01:27:27,861 --> 01:27:29,963
He's bringing
the meteorite back.

2087
01:27:30,096 --> 01:27:32,599
- Huh? Uh, yes, yes.
- (crowd clamoring)

2088
01:27:32,733 --> 01:27:34,601
Bringing... bringing it back.

2089
01:27:34,735 --> 01:27:36,470
That's precisely
what I am doing.

2090
01:27:39,873 --> 01:27:41,808
Look no further.

2091
01:27:41,942 --> 01:27:44,110
Your hero has arrived.

2092
01:27:44,245 --> 01:27:45,679
Professor, care to comment?

2093
01:27:45,812 --> 01:27:47,448
I tried to help them, Tiffany,

2094
01:27:47,581 --> 01:27:50,251
but in the end,
it's the same old story.

2095
01:27:50,384 --> 01:27:53,287
Bad guys bad, good guys good.

2096
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:54,921
So true. So wise.

2097
01:27:55,055 --> 01:27:56,490
Furthermore,
for the good of the city,

2098
01:27:56,623 --> 01:27:59,125
I have generously decided
to take the meteorite

2099
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:01,962
back to my compound
for safekeeping.

get away with this?

Thank you. Gosh, you're kind.
