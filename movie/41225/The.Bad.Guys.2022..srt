00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,800
<font color=#CD7F32>片名：坏蛋联盟

2
00:00:41,714 --> 00:00:43,182
停下
Stop.

3
00:00:43,316 --> 00:00:44,950
如果你向我解释一下，我就不说了
I'll stop if you just explain it to me

4
00:00:45,084 --> 00:00:46,519
-因为我不...-请你放下它好吗？
-because I don't... -Would you please just drop it?

5
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:47,986
好吧，好吧，好吧
All right, all right, fine, fine, fine, fine.

6
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:49,122
就当它掉了。它掉了
Consider it dropped. It's dropped.

7
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:51,257
-它掉在地上-好的
-It's on the ground. -Good.

8
00:00:52,258 --> 00:00:54,127
但是，我是说，拜托，每个人都喜欢生日。
But, I mean, come on, everybody loves birthdays.

9
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,994
你有装饰品
You got decorations.

10
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:57,996
你有气球。你有派对和蛋糕
You got balloons. You got parties and cake.

11
00:00:58,131 --> 00:00:59,632
听着我不需要礼物
Look, I don't need presents,

12
00:00:59,765 --> 00:01:02,768
我不想要装饰品，我也不喜欢蛋糕
I don't want decorations, and I'm-I'm not a cake guy.

13
00:01:02,901 --> 00:01:04,737
说真的，你不喜欢蛋糕吗？
Seriously, though, you don't like cake?

14
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,739
说出一种比蛋糕更好的食物。
Name one food better than cake.

15
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:08,006
豚鼠
Guinea pig.

16
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:09,875
哦，又是豚鼠
Oh, again with the guinea pig.

17
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:11,944
我打赌如果我蒙住你的眼睛
I bet if I blindfolded you,

18
00:01:12,077 --> 00:01:13,779
你不可能分辨出区别
you wouldn't be able to tell the difference

19
00:01:13,912 --> 00:01:15,748
在臭鼬和豚鼠之间
between a skunk and a guinea pig.

20
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:18,551
错，蛇的味蕾无可挑剔
Wrong. Snakes have impeccable taste buds.

21
00:01:18,684 --> 00:01:20,686
-我能尝到空气的味道-空气?
-I can taste air. -Air?

22
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:22,321
对空气
Yes. Air.

23
00:01:23,756 --> 00:01:25,291
嗯 非常棒
Mm. Nice.

24
00:01:25,424 --> 00:01:27,593
我不知道。他们有点。。。
I don't know. They're a little, uh...

25
00:01:27,726 --> 00:01:29,262
我觉得有点可爱
a little cute for my taste.

26
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:31,597
这就是它们如此美味的原因
That's what makes them so delicious.

27
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,499
你不仅仅是在吃东西
You're not just eating food.

28
00:01:33,632 --> 00:01:35,368
你吃的是纯粹的善良
You're eating pure goodness.

29
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:36,935
这与猪没什么区别
It's not about the pig.

30
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:40,439
它在更深层次上象征着什么
It's about what it symbolizes on a deeper level.

31
00:01:41,774 --> 00:01:43,142
所以，你可以...你确定能尝到空气的味道吗？
So, you can... you can taste air?

32
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:44,543
你还有什么？
What else you got?

33
00:01:44,677 --> 00:01:45,844
-算了吧-等等
-Forget about it. -W-W-Wait.

34
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:47,546
-你也能听到颜色吗
-Can you also hear color? 

35
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,548
你能看到声音吗-好吧，好吧
Can you see sound? -All right, all right. Okay.

36
00:01:49,682 --> 00:01:51,750
因为我们真的应该利用这些技能
'Cause we should really be capitalizing on these skills.

37
00:01:51,884 --> 00:01:53,619
好吧，好吧。把一切都说出来
Okay, all right, fine. Get it all out.

38
00:01:53,752 --> 00:01:54,953
-现在把它全部拿出来-好的，好的
-Get it all out now. -Okay, okay.

39
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:58,257
看看这个 下午四点
Look at that. 4:00 p.m.

40
00:01:58,391 --> 00:02:00,626
现在我知道我们友谊的确切时间了
Now I know the exact moment our friendship died.

41
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:04,463
-我们开始行动-是的
-Let's bounce. -Yep.

42
00:02:05,698 --> 00:02:09,034
看起来像是，你又想让我结账
Tastes like, um, you're gonna stick me with the bill-- again.

43
00:02:09,168 --> 00:02:10,936
今天是我的生日
Well, it is my birthday.

44
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:12,738
你现在玩生日骗了？
So now you play the birthday card?

45
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:14,573
这很有趣
That's interesting.

46
00:02:14,707 --> 00:02:18,010
下次有机会的时候，你能一起还我吗？
Can we get a check, please, when you get a chance?

47
00:02:18,143 --> 00:02:21,046
你好
Hello

48
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,681
你知道吗
You know what? 

49
00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:26,118
我们就把钱留在这里，好吗？
We're just gonna leave the money right here, okay?

50
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:27,986
你知道这地方的一个优点吗？
You know the one good thing about this place?

51
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,888
-什么 -我们从来不用等桌子
-What? -We never have to for a table.

52
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:31,324
这地方不是每次都这样吗？
Well, isn't that every place?

53
00:02:31,457 --> 00:02:33,025
嘿，伙计。最近怎么样？我好久没见到你了...
Hey, man. How you been? I haven't seen you in...

54
00:02:35,294 --> 00:02:36,862
哦薄荷糖
Oh. Mints.

55
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:38,731
抱歉，各位 我要把他换成无咖啡因的
Sorry, folks. I'm switching him to decaf.

56
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,467
好吧
All right.

57
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,236
让我们这样做
Let's do this


58
00:02:56,415 --> 00:02:57,616
豚鼠？
Guinea pig, huh?

59
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,618
这是啮齿动物中的劳斯莱斯
It's the Rolls-Royce of rodents.

60
00:02:59,752 --> 00:03:01,387
是的，但它还是一只啮齿动物
Yeah, but it's still a rodent.

61
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,356
你知道我的意思吗？
You know what I mean?

62
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:05,524
别介意，我们只是抢劫这个地方
Don't mind us, just robbing this place

63
00:03:19,472 --> 00:03:20,673
哇！是 啊

再近一点
Little bit closer.

67
00:03:33,752 --> 00:03:36,054
哦，我知道是什么
Oh, I know what it is.

68
00:03:36,188 --> 00:03:39,858
你害怕是因为我是。。。大灰狼
You're afraid because I'm the... the Big Bad Wolf.

69
00:03:39,992 --> 00:03:41,660
我并不惊讶
Well, I'm not surprised.

70
00:03:41,794 --> 00:03:43,562
我是每个故事中的反派
I am the villain in every story.

71
00:03:43,696 --> 00:03:44,797
是吗，斯内克先生？
Isn't that right, Mr. Snake?

72
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,198
是的
Yes.

73
00:03:46,332 --> 00:03:49,302
向斯内克先生问好
Say hello to Mr. Snake.

74

蛇 安全的破碎机

想象一下胡迪尼没有手臂

那种会告诉你杯子有一半空的人
Kind of guy who'd tell you the glass is half empty,

77
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:57,009
然后从你那里偷来
then steal it from you.

78
00:03:57,142 --> 00:03:58,511

今天是他的生日！

80
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:03,181

81
00:04:03,316 --> 00:04:04,983
-你是个甜心

82
00:04:05,117 --> 00:04:07,185

食人鱼，我们忘了什么吗？
Uh, Piranha, did we forget something?

124

是的，他们有点古怪

135
00:06:16,615 --> 00:06:18,316
但当你生在我们身上时，你并不一定会赢
but when you're born us, you don't exactly win

但这些是我们发的牌

-胸部是什么-你疯了吗？
-What the thorax? -Are you crazy?

148
00:06:48,947 --> 00:06:51,584
什么我只是想再追一次车

我要把你们关起来
I'm gonna put you guys away for so long

155
00:07:42,434 --> 00:07:44,870
你们这群跳蚤
your fleas will have fleas.

156
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,209
警长 你想吃蛋糕吗？
Chief. You want some cake?

157
00:07:51,343 --> 00:07:53,779
你好像有点难受
You seem a little hangry. 

158
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:55,380
在我。。。
Get that thing out of my face before I...

159
00:07:55,514 --> 00:07:58,150
-对不起，警长-什么
-Excuse me, Chief. -What?

160
00:08:12,397 --> 00:08:13,766
你是我的
You're mine.

161
00:08:18,904 --> 00:08:20,739
赫尔马诺
Hermano.

162
00:08:48,934 --> 00:08:51,269
是的，我们可能很坏
Yeah, we may be bad,

163
00:08:51,403 --> 00:08:53,071
但我们很快乐
but we're so good at it.

164
00:09:00,345 --> 00:09:02,380
哦，不，不，不，不，不，不，不！
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

165
00:09:02,514 --> 00:09:04,549
继续跑，狼！
Keep running, Wolf!

166
00:09:04,683 --> 00:09:07,753
算你们走运，总有一天我会抓到你们的
One of these days, your luck is gonna run out!

167
00:09:36,782 --> 00:09:39,718
好了，食人鱼，你起来了
All right, Piranha, you're up.

168
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:44,022
哦...
Oh...

169
00:09:44,156 --> 00:09:45,423
生日快...
Happy bir...

170
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:48,260
-真的吗-蛇，来吧
-Seriously? -Snake, come on.

171
00:09:48,393 --> 00:09:50,095
我们干一杯
At least make a toast.

172
00:09:50,228 --> 00:09:51,563
-干杯！来吧-来吧
-Toast! Come on! -Come on.

173
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:53,065
-好的，好的。好吧干杯-哇！
-SNAKE: Okay, okay. All right. A toast. -Whoo!

174
00:09:53,198 --> 00:09:54,667
好的
Fine.

175
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,870
在我的时代，我树敌很多，我是说，很多--
I've made a lot of enemies in my time-- I mean, a lot--

176
00:09:58,003 --> 00:10:01,006
但是在世界上所有的人当中
but out of all the people in the world,

177
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:02,641
我最喜欢你们了
I hate you guys the least.

178
00:10:02,775 --> 00:10:04,309
-啊-这真是太美了
-Aw. -That was actually kind of beautiful.

179
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:05,844
你是个诗人，伙计
You're a poet, man.

180
00:10:05,978 --> 00:10:09,748
斯内克先生和他对生日的奇怪厌恶。
To Mr. Snake and his strange dislike of birthdays.

181
00:10:09,882 --> 00:10:12,250
耶
Yay! 

182
00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:14,853
每个人都说“抢劫”
Everyone say, "Robbery."

183
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:16,388
抢劫。
Robbery.

184
00:10:16,521 --> 00:10:17,823
哦
Oh.

185
00:10:17,956 --> 00:10:19,792
看看那些酒窝。
Look at those dimples.

186
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:21,660
-生日快乐，伙计-可以
-Happy birthday, buddy. -Okay.

187
00:10:21,794 --> 00:10:23,595
-现在，加油，伙计们-对
-Now, dig in, fellas. -Yes!

188
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:25,664
食人鱼！
Piranha!

189
00:10:25,798 --> 00:10:27,165
别这样
Don't do that.

190
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:28,433
太恶心了
That was so gross.

191
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:30,035
那是我的午餐！
That was my lunch!

192
00:10:30,168 --> 00:10:32,037
你打盹，你输了
You snooze, you lose. 

193
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,572
你喜欢那样
You like that. 

194
00:10:34,707 --> 00:10:36,374
完美
Nice.

195
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:39,111
哦，哇
Ooh, wow. 

196
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:40,713
我忘了我们有推瓶
I forgot we had those Push Pops.

197
00:10:40,846 --> 00:10:43,448
伙计，我的肚子现在像海怪一样隆隆作响
Man, my tummy is rumbling like a kraken right now.

198
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:45,283
是 啊想要吗？
Yeah. Want it?

199
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:47,452
你知道他不会给你的
You know he's not gonna give it to you.

200
00:10:47,585 --> 00:10:49,454
不，我内心深处相信
No, I believe that deep down

201
00:10:49,587 --> 00:10:52,891
蛇是一个善良而慷慨的灵魂
Snake is a kind and generous soul.

202
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:54,259
为什么？
Why?

203
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:56,228
在这里拿去吧
Here. Take it.

204
00:10:56,361 --> 00:10:57,763
哦，是的！
Oh, yeah!

205
00:10:57,896 --> 00:10:59,064
请给我开门
Pop me, please.

206
00:10:59,197 --> 00:11:00,966
-啊-哈
-Ah... -Ha!

207
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:02,835
笨蛋
Sucker.

208
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:06,271
来吧，伙计。现在你要让我变得咄咄逼人
Come on, man. Now you gonna make me get all aggressive.

209
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:08,273
动物
Animals.

210
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:10,375
吐出来！吐出来！
Spit it out! Spit it out!

211
00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:11,844
从不
Never!

212
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:13,611
让我们看看他们今天在说什么
Let's see what they're saying about us today.

213
00:11:13,746 --> 00:11:15,413
怎么了？这里是蒂芙妮·弗洛菲特，第六频道动作新闻
What up? It's Tiffany Fluffit, Channel 6 Action News.

214
00:11:15,547 --> 00:11:17,349
坏人又袭击了。。。
The Bad Guys have struck again...

215
00:11:17,482 --> 00:11:20,452
伙计们，伙计们，住手。我们在电视上
Guys, guys, stop it. We're on TV.

216
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:22,020
-哦，哦！-。。。再次证明他们
-Ooh, ooh! -...proving once more that they

217
00:11:22,154 --> 00:11:24,589
是我们这个时代最邪恶的罪犯
are the most diabolical criminals of our time.

218
00:11:24,723 --> 00:11:27,559
哦，“恶魔”这是新的
Ooh, "diabolical." That's new.

219
00:11:27,692 --> 00:11:29,227
知道这听起来像什么吗？古龙水
Know what it sounds like? A cologne.

220
00:11:29,361 --> 00:11:30,595
恶魔般的
Diabolical.

221
00:11:30,729 --> 00:11:32,497
为了应对这场令人发指的犯罪狂潮
To address this heinous crime spree

222
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,600
是新当选的州长黛安·福辛顿
is the newly elected governor, Diane Foxington.

223
00:11:35,734 --> 00:11:37,002
-州长？ -好的 是 啊
-Governor? -Okay. Yeah.

224
00:11:37,135 --> 00:11:38,904
-我听到了。我听到了-（记者叫嚣）
-I hear you. I hear you. -(reporters clamoring)

225
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:42,607
听着，听着。我们都知道坏人有多卑鄙
Listen, listen. We all know how dastardly the Bad Guys are.

226
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:45,677
当然了-但最重要的是。。。
You bet we are. -But more than anything...

227
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:48,280
我为他们感到难过
I feel sorry for them.

228
00:11:48,413 --> 00:11:50,048
什么
What?

229
00:11:50,182 --> 00:11:51,784
这些所谓的坏人
These so-called Bad Guys

230
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:54,552
都是二流的。
are really just second-rate has-beens.

231
00:11:54,686 --> 00:11:56,588
在他们业余的滑稽动作背后
Behind their amateurish antics

232
00:11:56,721 --> 00:11:58,857
坦率地说，还有一些非原创的胡闹--
and, frankly, unoriginal capers--

233
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:00,793
我是说，真的，另一家银行--
I mean, really, another bank?--

234
00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:03,228
只不过是一口愤怒的深井。。。
is nothing but a deep well of anger...

235
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:04,629
我没生气！你生气了！
I ain't angry! You're angry!

236
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:06,398
否认-不是真的
denial -Not true.

237
00:12:06,531 --> 00:12:07,665
自我厌恶
and self-loathing.

238
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,802
我唯一讨厌的人就是你
The only one I self-loathe is you.

239
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:12,270
这些漏洞没有多少现金
And those are holes that no amount of cash

240
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:15,507
或者说无价的艺术永远无法填满
or priceless art can ever fill.

241
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:19,577
食品网络上有什么？
What's on the Food Network?

242
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:21,246
黛安：那么，我们能不能忘了。。。
DIANE: So, can we just forget about...

243
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:22,848
她是谁来评判我们？
Who-who is she to judge us?

244
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:24,817
专注于更积极的事情
and focus on more positive things? 

245
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,484
还有什么比这更积极的呢
And what could be more positive

246
00:12:26,618 --> 00:12:28,620
比一年一度的好撒马利亚奖，
than the Annual Good Samaritan Awards,

247
00:12:28,753 --> 00:12:31,723
明晚我将在那里展示金海豚
where tomorrow night I will present the Golden Dolphin

248
00:12:31,857 --> 00:12:35,193
献给今年最优秀的公民？
to this year's goodest citizen?

249
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:36,561
我不敢相信我投了她的票。
I can't believe I voted for her.

250
00:12:36,694 --> 00:12:37,963
你投了她的票？
You voted for her?

251
00:12:38,096 --> 00:12:40,632
什么？她擅长气候变化。
What? She's good on climate change.

252
00:12:40,765 --> 00:12:42,400
等待发生什么事？
Wait. What's going on?

253
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:45,037
你的眼睛闪闪发光
You've got that twinkle in your eye.

254
00:12:46,872 --> 00:12:50,042
伙计们，谁要换工作？
Guys, who's up for another job?

255
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:51,443
一个大的
A big one.

256
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:55,680
金色海豚
SNAKE: The Golden Dolphin.

257
00:12:55,814 --> 00:12:57,315
-真的吗-哦
-Seriously? -Oh.

258
00:12:57,449 --> 00:12:58,951
我以为我疯了
I thought I was the crazy one.

259
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:01,453
那项工作使每一个尝试过的罪犯都崩溃了
That job has broken every criminal who's tried it.

260
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:04,122
布加勒斯特强盗，幸运的吉姆
The Bucharest Bandits, Lucky Jim.

261
00:13:04,256 --> 00:13:05,924
深红色的爪子
The Crimson Paw.

262
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:07,759
事实上，那只深红色的爪子从未被捕
Actually, the Crimson Paw was never arrested.

263
00:13:07,893 --> 00:13:10,228
是的，但他再也没偷过东西了
Yeah, but he never stole anything again.

264
00:13:10,362 --> 00:13:11,964
斯内克，还有更好的办法吗
Snake, what better way

265
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:14,466
擦掉州长模糊的脸上的假笑
to wipe that smirk off the governor's fuzzy face

266
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,901
而不是偷金海豚
than stealing the Golden Dolphin

267
00:13:16,034 --> 00:13:17,903
就在她胡子底下？
from right under her whiskers?

268
00:13:18,036 --> 00:13:20,638
这是盗窃的圣杯。
This is the Holy Grail of thievery.

269
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:22,841
如果我们成功，我们将巩固我们的遗产
If we pull this off, we'll cement our legacy

270
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:25,243
作为史上最伟大的罪犯
as the greatest criminals of all time.

271
00:13:25,377 --> 00:13:26,879
伙计
Whoa, whoa, buddy.

272
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:29,514
我以为我们不该把事情说成是私事
I thought we weren't supposed to make things personal.

273
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:31,549
此外，我们有一件好事要做
Besides, we've got a good thing going here.

274
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:35,620
朋友们，自由，看看这些战利品
Friends, freedom, and just look at this loot.

275
00:13:36,421 --> 00:13:37,722
好吧，你说得对。算了吧
All right, you're right. Forget it.

276
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:40,025
-海豚队的任务结束了-好的
-The Dolphin job is off. -Good.

277
00:13:40,158 --> 00:13:42,460
我猜猪终究会得到他的奖杯。
I guess the pig will get his trophy after all.

278
00:13:42,594 --> 00:13:44,762
是的，我想他会。。。
Yeah, I guess he would...

279
00:13:44,897 --> 00:13:46,498
“猪”是什么意思？
What do you mean, "pig"?

280
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:48,100
哦，是的，我没提吗？
Oh, yes, did I not mention that?

281
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:50,702
真奇怪。我想我提到了，呃。。。
That's weird. I thought I mentioned that it was, uh...

282
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,238
善良的撒玛利亚人是。。。
The Good Samaritan is...

283
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:54,539
一只豚鼠？
A guinea pig?

284
00:13:56,341 --> 00:13:57,609
你说呢，斯纳基？
What do you say, Snakey?

285
00:13:57,742 --> 00:13:58,977
比蛋糕好
Better than cake.

286
00:13:59,111 --> 00:14:00,578
对
Right.

287
00:14:00,712 --> 00:14:03,381
好的。好的
Okay. Fine.

288
00:14:03,515 --> 00:14:05,083
但他最好是美味的。
But he better be delicious.

289
00:14:05,217 --> 00:14:07,285
我们都在一起吗？
Are we all in this together?

290
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:10,989
计划是这样的
So here's the plan.

291
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:13,358
和每年一样，仪式也将举行
Like every year, the ceremony will be held

292
00:14:13,491 --> 00:14:15,160
在美术馆
at the Museum of Fine Arts,

293
00:14:15,293 --> 00:14:17,729
金海豚将被安置在哪里
where the Golden Dolphin will be positioned

294
00:14:17,862 --> 00:14:20,332
就在后台的幕布后面
just beyond the backstage curtain.

295
00:14:20,465 --> 00:14:21,666
听起来很简单
Sounds easy.

296
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,835
听起来很容易，赫尔曼诺，但要达到目的
Sounds easy, hermano, but to get there,

297
00:14:23,969 --> 00:14:26,204
我们需要绕过三个安全级别
we'll need to bypass three levels of security.

298
00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:28,773
所以，第一步：我们需要融入其中
So, step one: We'll need to blend in.

299
00:14:37,215 --> 00:14:38,850
迈拉迪教授
Professor Marmalade,

300
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:41,119
今年的金海豚奖得主
this year's recipient of the Golden Dolphin,

301
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:43,655
地球上最令人讨厌的好生物
the most annoying good creature on the planet.

302
00:14:43,788 --> 00:14:46,258
教授，在过去的一年里，你停止了战争
Professor, in the past year, you've stopped wars,

303
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:48,793
给饥饿的人喂食，拯救了无数的熊猫
fed the hungry and saved countless pandas.

304
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:50,528
有些人描述了你的善良
Some have described your goodness

305
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:52,597
仅次于特蕾莎修女。
as second only to Mother Teresa.

306
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,167
哦，蒂芙尼，这不是比赛
Oh, Tiffany, it's not a competition.

307
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,735
如果是的话，那就更像是平局了。
And if it were, it would really be more of a tie.

308
00:14:57,869 --> 00:15:00,939
但我们都同意，有一朵善良之花
But we can all agree that there is a flower of goodness

309
00:15:01,073 --> 00:15:04,009
在我们所有人的内心，等待着绽放
inside all of us, just waiting to blossom.

310
00:15:04,142 --> 00:15:06,945
一进门，就有两扇装甲门
WOLF: Once inside, there are two armored doors.

311
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,281
第一个只能由
The first can only be opened by

312
00:15:09,414 --> 00:15:11,049
随身携带的特殊钥匙卡
a special key card that is carried

313
00:15:11,183 --> 00:15:12,951
我们亲爱的朋友，警察局长
by our dear friend, the chief of police.

314
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:14,953
第二台装有视网膜扫描仪
The second is outfitted with a retinal scanner

315
00:15:15,087 --> 00:15:17,755
由一支精英特种部队守卫
and guarded by an elite special ops unit

316
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:20,392
经过训练，可以先罢工，然后再提问
trained to strike first and ask questions later.

317
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,362
福辛顿州长是唯一一个
Governor Foxington is the only one

318
00:15:24,496 --> 00:15:26,331
他有打开第二扇门的许可
who has clearance to open the second door.

319
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:28,733
所以，第二步：她和我需要
So, step two: She and I will need to get

320
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:30,535
近距离的私人约会
up close and personal.

321
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:32,337
祝你晚上愉快，大使先生。
Enjoy your evening, Mr. Ambassador.

322
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,505
谢谢你，女士
Thank you, ma'am.

323
00:15:33,638 --> 00:15:35,040
很有意思
Interesting piece.

324
00:15:35,173 --> 00:15:38,576
无用的、毫无意义的、自命不凡的
Trashy, pointless and pretentious.

325
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,079
他们说艺术揭示了
Hmm. They say that art reveals

326
00:15:41,213 --> 00:15:42,880
与其说是艺术家，不如说是观众
more about the viewer than the artist.

327
00:15:43,015 --> 00:15:44,449
先生。。。
Mister...

328
00:15:44,582 --> 00:15:46,618
普德尔顿。奥利弗·普德尔顿
Poodleton. Oliver Poodleton.

329
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:47,719
嗯。。。可以
Uh... okay.

330
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:49,754
是时候有人站起来了
It's about time someone stood up

331
00:15:49,887 --> 00:15:52,124
给那些邪恶的坏蛋
to those diabolical Bad Guys.

332
00:15:52,257 --> 00:15:55,260
不过，我得说，还没有人成功
Though, I've got to say, no one's succeeded yet.

333
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:57,996
嗯。我觉得没那么难
Eh. I don't think it'll be that hard.

334
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,132
我感觉会比你想象的更难
I have a feeling it'll be harder than you think.

335
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:02,267
我得说他们就差一个史诗般的工作了
I'd say they're one epic job away

336
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,102
巩固他们的遗产
from cementing their legacy.

337
00:16:06,838 --> 00:16:08,573
普德尔顿先生，你真有趣
Mr. Poodleton, you're-you're funny.

338
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:10,142
我是？
I am?

339
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:12,544
他们正在巩固的唯一遗产是终身监禁
The only legacy they're cementing is life in prison.

340
00:16:12,677 --> 00:16:14,379
你看到他们上一份工作了吗？
Did you see their last job?

341
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:15,980
啊。安全出口，
Ugh. Unsecured exits,

342
00:16:16,114 --> 00:16:18,383
粗鲁的伪装，强迫性的表演。
crude disguises, compulsive showboating.

343
00:16:18,516 --> 00:16:19,884
我是说，那是一团糟。
I mean, it was a mess.

344
00:16:20,018 --> 00:16:22,687
船员衰落的所有经典迹象。
All the classic signs of a crew in decline.

345
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,757
下一步，他们会把它变成私人的。
Next, they're gonna make it personal.

346
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,393
这时你就知道他们是土司了。
That's when you know they're toast.

347
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:31,663
嗯，那是你的意见。
Uh, well, that's your opinion.

348
00:16:31,796 --> 00:16:34,332
是的，我是州长。
It is, and I'm the governor.

349
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:39,437
至于雕塑，我认为它是关于透视的。
As for the sculpture, I think it's about perspective.

350
00:16:39,571 --> 00:16:41,273
如果你仔细观察，
If you look closely enough,

351
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:45,943
即使是垃圾也可以被回收成美丽的东西。
even trash can be recycled into something beautiful.

352
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:48,113
怎么样？
How about that?

353
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:52,584
我猜有些事情并不总是表面上的样子。
I guess some things aren't always as they appear.

354
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:53,918
这提醒了我。
That reminds me.

355
00:16:54,052 --> 00:16:55,720
我可以吗？我不能错过拍照机会
May I? I can't miss a photo op

356
00:16:55,853 --> 00:16:57,355
州长和一堆垃圾。
with the governor and a pile of garbage.

357
00:16:57,489 --> 00:17:00,925
哦，普德尔顿先生，你对自己太苛刻了。
Oh, Mr. Poodleton, you're too hard on yourself.

358
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:02,594
嘿...
Hey... 

359
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,698
好的，朋友们。
WOLF: Okay, friends.

360
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:08,633
表演时间到了。
It's showtime.

361
00:17:10,368 --> 00:17:12,437
一旦我们进入，就进入第三步：
Once we're in, it's on to step three:

362
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,140
我们分头行动，各就各位
We split up and we take our positions.

363
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:18,843
伙计们，如果坏人破坏了这场比赛，
Officers, if the Bad Guys crash this event,

364
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:20,945
我肯定会失业，
I am definitely going to lose my job,

365
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,282
我会毫不犹豫地把你带走。
and I will not hesitate to take you down with me.

366
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,151
-现在，都出去盯着-是的，长官！
-Now, move out. -OFFICERS: Yes, ma'am!

367
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:46,538
麦克风打开，所有人都收到了吗？
Mic's on. Everyone on comms, do you copy?

368
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:47,772
-收到-收到
-Copy. -Copy. 

369
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:49,474
收到。
Copy.

370
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:09,861
给这位漂亮女士喝一杯？
A drink for the pretty lady?

371
00:18:09,994 --> 00:18:12,630
不用了，谢谢。我现在的生活太复杂了。
No, thank you. My life is too complicated right now.

372
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,595
孩子们，这是海豚的季节。
Boys, it's Dolphin season.

373
00:18:46,698 --> 00:18:49,201
收到。我要走了。
Copy that. I'm on the move.

374
00:18:50,335 --> 00:18:52,170
第二单元，后台区域还安全吗？
Unit two, is the backstage area still secure?

375
00:18:52,304 --> 00:18:53,538
第二单元。一切正常。
Unit two. All clear.

376
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:55,973
这是所有培训的回报。
This is where all the training pays off.

377
00:18:56,107 --> 00:18:57,709
哦，原谅我。
Oh, pardon me.

378
00:18:57,842 --> 00:18:59,677
-非常抱歉-没问题，先生。
-Terribly sorry. -Not a problem, sir.

379
00:18:59,811 --> 00:19:01,713
孩子们，睁大眼睛。
Keep your eyes open, boys.

380
00:19:01,846 --> 00:19:05,817
他们可能在任何地方，只是等着羞辱我们
They could be anywhere, just waiting to humiliate us.

381
00:19:08,486 --> 00:19:10,054
狼已经就位了。
Wolf is in position.

382
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:12,524
食人鱼，你们都穿着企鹅服，穿着靴子吗？
(over radio): Piranha, you all penguin-suited and booted?

383
00:19:12,657 --> 00:19:16,093
肯定的我是一个干净，卑鄙，偷海豚的机器。
Affirmative. I'm a clean, mean, Dolphin-stealing machine.

384
00:19:16,228 --> 00:19:18,129
怎么了，伙计们？
What's going on, guys?

385
00:20:01,406 --> 00:20:03,508
-来，我来帮你-哦。
-Here, let me help you. -Ooh.

386
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:04,876
你没事吧，夫人？
Are you okay, ma'am?

387
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:08,045
哦，天哪，是的。
Oh, my gracious, yes.

388
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:11,716
我可能会头晕，但多亏了你，我还活着。
I may be dizzy, but I'm alive, thanks to you.

389
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:13,418
你是什么-哦
What are you... -Oh.

390
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:14,786
嗯。
Mm.

391
00:20:16,488 --> 00:20:19,090
谢谢你，亲爱的。
Thank you, dear.

392
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:22,927
你真是个好孩子。
You're such a good boy.

393
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,348
好吗，兄弟？
All good, brother?

394
00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:46,751
是的，所有。。。很好。是的，是的。
Yeah, all... a-all good. Yeah, yeah.

395
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:48,320
嗯...
Um... 

396
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:50,922
韦伯斯，继续第四步怎么样？
Webs, what do you say about moving on to step four?

397
00:20:51,055 --> 00:20:53,691
收到。Shark，你起来了。
Copy that. Shark, you're up.

398
00:20:53,825 --> 00:20:55,993
-做你的事-我可以随机应变吗？
-Do your thing. -Do I get to improvise?

399
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:58,029
是的，很好。随机应变
Yes, fine. Improvise.

400
00:20:58,162 --> 00:20:59,797
但请小心点。
But please be subtle.

401
00:20:59,931 --> 00:21:01,666
嗯。
Mm-hmm.

402
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,437
我要生孩子了！
I'm having a baby!

403
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,904
有医生吗？
Is there a doctor?

404
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:08,973
或者几个保安
Or perhaps several security guards

405
00:21:09,106 --> 00:21:10,908
可以离开他们的岗位帮助我吗？
that could leave their post and help me?

406
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:32,630
“有惊喜”？
"Fish surprise"?

407
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:35,500
惊喜
Surprise! 

408
00:21:42,674 --> 00:21:44,342
嘿，韦伯斯，你能把这个。。。
Hey, Webs, can you enhance this...

409
00:21:44,476 --> 00:21:47,044
完成了。你前面八步，沃尔夫。
Done. Eight steps ahead of you, Wolfie.

410
00:21:54,452 --> 00:21:55,687
女士们，先生们，
Ladies and gentlemen,

411
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,756
你的好心人奖主持人。。。
your emcee for the Good Samaritan Awards...

412
00:22:00,358 --> 00:22:02,193
好了，鲨鱼，我们进去了。
All right, Shark, we're in.

413
00:22:02,326 --> 00:22:04,396
我忘了，我没有怀孕。
Oops, I forgot, I'm not pregnant.

414
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:06,564
委员会主席，
president of the committee,

415
00:22:06,698 --> 00:22:09,000
戴安·福辛顿州长。
Governor Diane Foxington.

416
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:11,736
非常感谢。非常感谢。非常感谢。

非常感谢。
Thank you.

418
00:22:14,171 --> 00:22:17,074
去年，我们面临着最大的考验
Last year, we faced our biggest test

419
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:20,678
当一颗陨石撞上我们亲爱的城市。
when a meteorite crashed into our dear city.

420
00:22:20,812 --> 00:22:23,781
那颗陨石不仅在我们的城市里留下了一个洞。
That meteorite didn't just make a hole in our city.

421
00:22:23,915 --> 00:22:25,783
它在我们心中留下了一个洞。
It made a hole in our hearts.

422
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:27,719
哦
Aw

423
00:22:27,852 --> 00:22:30,121
但即使在悲剧中，迈拉迪教授，
But even in tragedy, Professor Marmalade,

424
00:22:30,254 --> 00:22:31,956
他做得很好。
he did what he does so well.

425
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:34,459
他让我们用不同的眼光看待事物。
He made us look at things differently.

426
00:22:34,592 --> 00:22:36,293
多亏了你，果酱，
And thanks to you, Marmalade,

427
00:22:36,428 --> 00:22:40,031
爱情陨石坑将永远成为一个象征
the Love Crater Meteorite will forever serve as a symbol

428
00:22:40,164 --> 00:22:43,801
即使在最糟糕的地方也有好的一面。
of how there is good even in the worst places.

429
00:22:45,537 --> 00:22:46,804
哇！
Whoo!

430
00:23:00,485 --> 00:23:02,086
...成功扭转了气候变化
...and successfully reversed climate change

431
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:04,489
为了我们所有人的幸福。
for the well-being of all of us.

432
00:23:04,622 --> 00:23:08,225
事情进展得出人意料地顺利。
This is going surprisingly smoothly.

433
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,202
那是什么蜕皮？
What the molt is that?

434
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:19,737
狼食人鱼蛇鲨狼蛛
The Wolf Piranha Snake Shark Tarantula

435
00:23:19,871 --> 00:23:21,739
-系统保护-断续器？
-Protection System. -The WPSST?

436
00:23:21,873 --> 00:23:24,241
-这是不应该发生的-什么
-This was not supposed to happen. -What?

437
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,277
伙计们，冷静点。我会的。
Guys, calm down. I'm on it.

438
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,781
正在启动断续器覆盖协议
Initiating WPSST override protocol. 

439
00:23:29,914 --> 00:23:31,082
明白了，皇后！
Get it, queen!

440
00:23:32,717 --> 00:23:34,852
有用吗-给我五分钟。
Did it work? -Just give me five minutes.

441
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:38,322
现在，请和我一起欢迎来到舞台上。。。
And now, please join me in welcoming to the stage...

442
00:23:38,456 --> 00:23:40,091
我们没有五分钟了。
We don't have five minutes.

443
00:23:40,224 --> 00:23:42,326
迈拉迪教授。
Professor Marmalade.

444
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,394
哦。
Aw.

445
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:45,763
我们爱你，迈拉迪教授
We love you, Professor Marmalade!

446
00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:47,098
猪在动。
The pig is on the move.

447
00:23:47,231 --> 00:23:49,366
我再说一遍，猪在动。
I repeat, the pig is on the move.

448
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:51,869
织网，织网，窗帘随时都会升起。
Webs, Webs, the curtain's going up any minute.

449
00:23:52,003 --> 00:23:53,070
它不让我进去。
It's not letting me in.

450
00:23:53,204 --> 00:23:54,371
检查你的系统偏好。
Check your system preferences.

451
00:23:54,506 --> 00:23:55,807
你可能需要下载一个驱动程序。
You probably need to download a driver.

452
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,908
尝试重新启动。
Try rebooting.

453
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,409
天哪，你修好了。
Oh, my gosh, you fixed it.

454
00:23:58,543 --> 00:23:59,644
-真的吗-不
- Really? -No!

455
00:23:59,777 --> 00:24:01,546
嘿，拉里。
Hey, Larry.

456
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,647
来吧，开门。
Come on, open up.

457
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,448
关于锁门我们说了什么？
What did we say about locking doors?

458
00:24:04,582 --> 00:24:06,918
哦，不，不，不，不，不，鲨鱼，我这里有情况。
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Shark, I got a situation here.

459
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:08,252
收到。我在路上。
Copy that. I'm on my way.

460
00:24:10,287 --> 00:24:11,523
快点，伙计们。
Hurry up, guys.

461
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:14,158
是时候让这个婴儿进入野兽模式了。
Time to turn this baby on beast mode.

462
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:18,596
吃了它，断续器！
Eat it, WPSST!

463
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:24,602
拜托，现在不行
Please, not now. 

464
00:24:24,736 --> 00:24:26,403
-等等，等等，等等。不，不，食人鱼！
-Wolf. -Wait, wait, wait. No, no, Piranha!

465
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:29,273
-这个奖是给
-This award is for...

466
00:24:30,307 --> 00:24:32,076
就像我说的。。。
As I was saying...

467
00:24:39,784 --> 00:24:42,453
-食人鱼！你在开玩笑吗-对不起！
-Piranha! Are you kidding me? -Sorry!

468
00:24:42,587 --> 00:24:44,689
这就是为什么我的慈善晚会
And that's why my Gala for Goodness

469
00:24:44,822 --> 00:24:47,592
将为那些不幸的人筹集所需的所有资金。
will raise all the money needed for those less fortunate.

470
00:24:47,725 --> 00:24:48,960
来吧
Come on! 

471
00:24:50,862 --> 00:24:53,297
我开始生气了，拉里。
I'm starting to get mad here, Larry.

472
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:55,833
网！网
Webs! Webs! 

473
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:59,604
现在是我们一直在等待的时刻。
And now the moment we've all been waiting for.

474
00:25:13,885 --> 00:25:15,119
对不起。
Excuse me.

475
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:16,754
这是女厕所吗？
Is this the ladies' room?

476
00:25:16,888 --> 00:25:18,923
你得右转
Oh, uh, y-you need to take a right

477
00:25:19,056 --> 00:25:20,925
在大厅的尽头，女士。
at the end of the hall, ma'am.

478
00:25:26,197 --> 00:25:28,499
对
Yes. 

479
00:25:29,801 --> 00:25:30,868
哦，来吧！
Oh, come on!

480
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:35,272
现在我很荣幸授予迈拉迪教授
And now it is my honor to award Professor Marmalade

481
00:25:35,406 --> 00:25:39,476
和金海豚一起！
with the Golden Dolphin!

482
00:25:41,178 --> 00:25:42,479
不-不。
No. -No.

483
00:25:42,614 --> 00:25:43,748
是的！
Yes!

484
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:46,117
我是说，是的！
I mean, yes!

485
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,919
什么
What?

486
00:25:52,957 --> 00:25:55,259
大家，大家，请不要惊慌。
Everyone, everyone, uh, please don't panic.

487
00:25:55,392 --> 00:25:56,694
保持冷静。
Just stay calm.

488
00:25:56,828 --> 00:25:59,130
我相信这是有原因的。
I'm-I'm sure there's an explanation for this.

489
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:04,001
我再说一遍，请不要惊慌。
I repeat, uh, please do not panic.

490
00:26:05,603 --> 00:26:07,271
大家干得好。
Nice work, everybody.

491
00:26:07,404 --> 00:26:10,407
现在，让我们像狼一样，把狼群带出去。
Now, let's make like a wolf and get the pack out of here.

492
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:12,409
啊，文字游戏。
Ah, wordplay.

493
00:26:12,543 --> 00:26:13,711
我不明白。
I don't get it.

494
00:26:13,845 --> 00:26:15,713
黛安，黛安，如果我可以。。。
Diane, Diane, if I may...

495
00:26:15,847 --> 00:26:17,915
你必须理解，
You have to understand,

496
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:21,185
我没有为获奖而把希望带回城市。
I didn't bring hope back to the city for an award.

497
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:25,222
我做这些好事是因为它们给我的感觉。
I did these good things because of how they made me feel.

498
00:26:25,356 --> 00:26:26,858
我有种刺痛的感觉。
That tingly feeling I get.

499
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:28,292
让我脊梁骨颤抖。
That shiver up my spine.

500
00:26:28,425 --> 00:26:32,196
我的小尾巴在摇摆。
The wag in my tiny tail.

501
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:34,165
因为，你看，
Because, you see,

502
00:26:34,298 --> 00:26:38,535
感觉很好。
being good just feels so good.

503
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:42,674
当你很好的时候，你会被爱。
And when you're good, you're loved.

504
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:45,777
狼？
Wolf?

505
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,311
你在做什么？
-Wolf? -What are you doing?

506
00:26:47,444 --> 00:26:49,413
走！
Go!

507
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:51,348
有坏人
It's the Bad Guys! 

508
00:26:51,482 --> 00:26:52,650
逮捕他们！
Arrest them!

509
00:26:58,255 --> 00:26:59,556
他们偷走了金海豚！
They stole the Golden Dolphin!

510
00:26:59,691 --> 00:27:02,526
拜托，你不能证明这一点。
Come on, you can't prove that.

511
00:27:04,461 --> 00:27:06,330
我的宝贝！
My baby!

512
00:27:06,463 --> 00:27:07,999
跪下，坏蛋
On your knees, Bad Guys. 

513
00:27:08,132 --> 00:27:09,233
举起手来。
With your hands up.

514
00:27:09,366 --> 00:27:11,402
从不我们要走了。
Never! We're out of here.

515
00:27:14,138 --> 00:27:16,373
再见，笨蛋。
So long, suckers.

516
00:27:22,513 --> 00:27:25,216
这有点奇怪。
Well, this just got a little weird.

517
00:27:27,351 --> 00:27:29,020
坏人破产了。
The Bad Guys go bust.

518
00:27:29,153 --> 00:27:32,156
邪恶的五人组终于被抓获了
The nefarious fivesome has finally been captured.

519
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:34,926
我蒂芙妮·弗洛菲特是第一个到场的
And I, Tiffany Fluffit, am first on the scene.

520
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:37,729
哇！我刚刚意识到我
Wow. You know, I-I just realized that I have devoted

521
00:27:37,862 --> 00:27:40,331
我的整个成年生活都是为了把你关进监狱
my entire adult life to putting you in jail.

522
00:27:40,464 --> 00:27:42,066
你是我的目标
You are my purpose.

523
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:43,968
没有你，我是谁？
Without you, who am I?

524
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:45,402
我只是开玩笑
Ah, I'm just kidding.

525
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,204
这是我一生中最美好的时刻！
This is the best moment of my life!

526
00:27:48,505 --> 00:27:51,175
这是坏人的末日
It's the end of the Bad Guys.

527
00:27:51,308 --> 00:27:52,609
不
No!

528
00:27:52,744 --> 00:27:54,645
把手拿开！
Get your hands off of me! 

529
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,148
哦，你现在求我咬你一口。
Ooh, you're begging for a biting right now.

530
00:27:57,281 --> 00:27:58,682
狼
Wolf!

531
00:28:01,986 --> 00:28:03,721
迈拉迪教授！州长女士！
TIFFANY: Professor Marmalade! Madam Governor!

532
00:28:03,855 --> 00:28:05,589
哦，迈拉迪教授！州长女士！
Ooh, Professor Marmalade! Madam Governor!

533
00:28:05,723 --> 00:28:07,825
-州长女士-一次一个。一次一个
-Madam Governor! -One at a time. One at a time.

534
00:28:10,394 --> 00:28:11,628
-嘿。嘿-打扰一下
-Hey. Hey! -Excuse me.

535
00:28:11,763 --> 00:28:13,597
抱歉打断一下
Sorry to interrupt.

536
00:28:13,731 --> 00:28:16,433
我只是想祝贺这里的州长
I just wanted to congratulate the governor here.

537
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:19,036
我得说，你真的让我们陷入困境
I got to say, you really got us pegged.

538
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:23,407
我们只是一口充满愤怒和自我厌恶的深井
We're just a deep well of anger and self-loathing.

539
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,376
-否认-当然那也是
-Denial. -Sure. That, too.

540
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:26,577
-自恋-是 啊是 啊
-Narcissism. -Yeah. Yeah.

541
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,879
情感空虚。
Emotional emptiness.

542
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:29,413
-所以我们在同一页上-隐马尔可夫模型
-So we're on the same page. -Hmm.

543
00:28:29,546 --> 00:28:31,515
他在干什么？
What is he doing?

544
00:28:31,648 --> 00:28:34,685
遗憾的是，我们从来没有机会
Sadly, we were never given a chance

545
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:38,289
比二流罪犯还要厉害
to be anything more than second-rate criminals.

546
00:28:38,422 --> 00:28:40,892
要是有人能帮忙就好了
If only there was someone who could help

547
00:28:41,025 --> 00:28:44,561
我们内心善良的花朵盛开
the flower of goodness inside us blossom.

548
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:46,964
爱与宽恕的象征
Some icon of love and forgiveness,

549
00:28:47,098 --> 00:28:50,401
比如，呃，我不知道，特蕾莎修女
like, uh, I don't know, Mother Teresa.

550
00:28:50,534 --> 00:28:53,470
最好的办法就是把我们关进监狱
Best thing is to just throw us in jail

551
00:28:53,604 --> 00:28:56,107
在我们绝望的余生里
for the rest of our hopeless lives.

552
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,909
是的，这就是计划
Yeah, that's the plan.

553
00:28:58,042 --> 00:28:59,676
-等等，等等，等等，不，不
-Wait, wait, wait, no, no. -(grunting)

554
00:28:59,811 --> 00:29:01,378
-进去-噢
-Get in there. -Ow!

555
00:29:01,512 --> 00:29:03,447
等等
Wait.

556
00:29:04,248 --> 00:29:05,482
求你了。。。请再说一遍？
Uh, beg... beg pardon?

557
00:29:05,616 --> 00:29:07,518
沃尔夫先生可能是一头凶猛的野兽
Mr. Wolf may be a savage beast.

558
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:09,186
基本上是步行垃圾
Basically walking garbage.

559
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,654
抱歉，我想说的是
Sorry, I'm making a point.

560
00:29:10,788 --> 00:29:12,389
做你该做的，伙计
Do what you need to do, pal.

561
00:29:12,523 --> 00:29:14,558
但我们怎么能说他们没有希望呢
But how can we say they're hopeless

562
00:29:14,691 --> 00:29:16,894
如果他们从来没有机会？
if they've never been given a chance?

563
00:29:17,028 --> 00:29:19,997
如果…怎么办。。。如果我们做个小实验呢，黛安？
What if... what if we tried a little experiment, Diane?

564
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:22,633
如你所知，我为上帝举办的晚会
As you know, my Gala for Goodness,

565
00:29:22,766 --> 00:29:26,470
“年度最佳慈善活动”即将揭晓
the "hashtag charity event of the year," is coming up.

566
00:29:26,603 --> 00:29:28,339
如果我能在晚会上向大家证明
If I can prove to everyone at that gala

567
00:29:28,472 --> 00:29:29,874
坏人变了，
that the Bad Guys have changed,

568
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:32,509
你会让他们自由，给他们一个干净的开始吗？
will you set them free and give them a clean start?

569
00:29:34,078 --> 00:29:36,147
-什么？迈拉迪教授-噢！
-What? Professor Marmalade! -Ow!

570
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,515
不不你没看到他在干什么吗？
No, no, no, no, no. Don't you see what he's doing?

571
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:40,151
他在耍你
He's playing you.

572
00:29:40,284 --> 00:29:41,352
但这是我的主意
But it was my idea.

573
00:29:41,485 --> 00:29:42,619
这是他的主意
It was his idea.

574
00:29:42,753 --> 00:29:44,621
但只是因为你让他得到了它
But only because you made him have it.

575
00:29:44,755 --> 00:29:46,958
州长夫人，你不能让他们走
Madam Governor, you can't just let them go.

576
00:29:47,091 --> 00:29:49,360
教授，我不会为了城市的安全
Professor, I'm not about to put the safety of the city

577
00:29:49,493 --> 00:29:51,428
正在排队做实验
on the line for an experiment.

578
00:29:51,562 --> 00:29:53,064
对不起，州长女士
Excuse me, Madam Governor.

579
00:29:53,197 --> 00:29:56,800
我似乎记得一位智者曾经说过
I seem to remember that a wise person once said,

580
00:29:56,934 --> 00:30:01,138
“即使是垃圾也可以被回收成美丽的东西。”
"Even trash can be recycled into something beautiful."

581
00:30:04,775 --> 00:30:06,077
可以我很高兴
Okay. I'm game.

582
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,745
只是因为是你，教授
But only because it's you, Professor.

583
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,981
不
No!

584
00:30:10,114 --> 00:30:12,183
我们会抓住海豚直到晚会
We'll hold on to the Dolphin until the gala.

585
00:30:12,316 --> 00:30:15,586
只是为了消除任何不必要的诱惑
Just to remove any unnecessary temptation.

586
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:17,754
当然好主意
Of course. Good thinking.

587
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:19,823
这就是为什么你是州长
That's why you're governor.

588
00:30:19,957 --> 00:30:22,226
现在大家都很开心。。。
Now that everyone's happy...

589
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,694
不开心
Not happy.

590
00:30:23,827 --> 00:30:26,330
我.鲁伯特·玛玛拉德四世
I, Rupert Marmalade the Fourth,

591
00:30:26,463 --> 00:30:28,399
会把坏人变成。。。
will turn the Bad Guys into...

592
00:30:28,532 --> 00:30:30,267
-好人
-the Good Guys! 

593
00:30:34,872 --> 00:30:37,141
我想这些是你的。
I think these belong to you.

594
00:30:37,274 --> 00:30:38,675
嘿
Hey.

595
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:42,413
不是每个人都有第二次机会
Not everyone gets a second chance.

596
00:30:42,546 --> 00:30:46,617
充分利用它，普德尔顿先生
Make the most of it, Mr. Poodleton.

597
00:30:55,126 --> 00:30:57,328
狼？
SNAKE: Wolf?

598
00:30:57,461 --> 00:30:58,629
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

599
00:30:58,762 --> 00:31:00,197
什么-是的。
What? -OTHERS: Yeah.

600
00:31:00,331 --> 00:31:02,266
哦，那个
Oh, that. 

601
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,102
对不起。我觉得这很明显
I-I-I'm sorry. I thought it was, uh, obvious.

602
00:31:05,236 --> 00:31:07,271
我们会顺利的
We're gonna go good.

603
00:31:08,472 --> 00:31:10,174
你完全失去了我
Uh, you totally lost me.

604
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:12,409
我告诉他不要在厕所外喝酒
I told him to stop drinking out of the toilet.

605
00:31:12,543 --> 00:31:14,478
嘿，你的头被击中了吗？
Hey, did you get hit on the head?

606
00:31:14,611 --> 00:31:15,846
什么不，我的头没有被击中。
What? No, I didn't get hit on the head.

607
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,548
我表弟的头被锚击中了
My cousin got hit on the head with an anchor,

608
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:19,316
在那之后，他只游了一圈
and after that, he only swam in a circle.

609
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,518
不，不，哥们，哥们，你们没跟着我
No, no, g-guys, guys, you're not following me.

610
00:31:21,652 --> 00:31:24,555
我们要假装一切顺利
We're gonna pretend to go good.

611
00:31:24,688 --> 00:31:26,223
就几天吃果酱。
Just a few days with Marmalade.

612
00:31:26,357 --> 00:31:30,361
然后我们以好人的身份参加晚会
And then we roll into the gala as Good Guys

613
00:31:30,494 --> 00:31:33,697
推出苏格兰免费的。。。
and roll out scot-free with...

614
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,633
金色海豚。
The Golden Dolphin.

615
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:37,901
你明白了
You got it.

616
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:40,171
我们什么时候才能完成一项工作？
Since when do we not finish a job?

617
00:31:40,304 --> 00:31:43,574
坏人变成好人
The Bad Guys become the Good Guys

618
00:31:43,707 --> 00:31:46,843
所以我们可以留下来对付坏人
so we can stay the Bad Guys.

619
00:31:46,978 --> 00:31:49,413
你知道我在说什么吗
You know what I'm saying? 

620
00:31:49,546 --> 00:31:50,948
坏人表现得好吗？
Bad Guys acting good?

621
00:31:51,082 --> 00:31:52,783
这是最坏的家伙。
It's the ultimate Bad Guy thing.

622
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:54,218
太棒了
It's fantastic.

623
00:31:54,351 --> 00:31:55,652
沃尔夫，你是个天才
Wolf, you're a genius.

624
00:31:57,354 --> 00:31:59,690
这将是有史以来最轻松的骗局
It's gonna be, like, the most relaxing con ever,

625
00:31:59,823 --> 00:32:01,292
就像度假一样
like a vacation.

626
00:32:01,425 --> 00:32:03,660
哦，哦。一场辩论
Oh, oh. A con-cation.

627
00:32:05,562 --> 00:32:09,233
哦！我父母是在一次会议上认识的
Ooh! My parents met on a con-cation.

628
00:32:23,314 --> 00:32:24,481
哦，太好了
Oh, goody.

629
00:32:24,615 --> 00:32:26,050
哇
Wow.

630
00:32:26,183 --> 00:32:27,651
又大又漂亮
Big and fancy.

631
00:32:27,784 --> 00:32:29,953
啮齿动物有味道。可以
Rodent's got taste. Okay.

632
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:32,856
呵呵。几乎让我想变得可爱
Huh. Almost makes me want to be cute.

633
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,360
他们说经验是最好的老师。
They say experience is the best teacher.

634
00:32:36,493 --> 00:32:38,195
他们错了。
And they are wrong.

635
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:39,563
我是
I am.

636
00:32:39,696 --> 00:32:41,898
早上好，善良的学生们
Good morning, students of goodness.

637
00:32:42,033 --> 00:32:47,171
欢迎来到你余生最美好的第一天
And welcome to the first day of the rest of your best life.

638
00:32:47,304 --> 00:32:48,505
一个巨大的屁股
A giant butt.

639
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:49,840
嗯？
Huh?

640
00:32:49,973 --> 00:32:51,475
不是屁股
Uh, it's-it's not a butt.

641
00:32:51,608 --> 00:32:54,111
这是一盏灯的形状
It's a lamp in the shape of

642
00:32:54,245 --> 00:32:56,380
爱陨石坑陨石，我最伟大的。。。
the Love Crater Meteorite, my greatest...

643
00:32:56,513 --> 00:32:58,449
-我想知道这是谁的屁股-嗯。。。
-I wonder whose butt it is. -Uh...

644
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,252
再一次，它不是屁股。非常感谢
Once again, it's not a butt. Thank you.

645
00:33:01,385 --> 00:33:03,254
这是一颗心。现在，正如我所说。。。
It's a heart. Now, as I was saying...

646
00:33:03,387 --> 00:33:05,656
-那它为什么有脸颊-闭嘴！
-Then why does it have cheeks? -Shut it!

647
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:07,524
什么我从没见过有双颊的心
What? I've never seen a heart with cheeks.

648
00:33:07,658 --> 00:33:09,126
这不是。。。
It's not a...

649
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,628
-战利品-不是屁股！不是屁股！
-Booty! -It's not a butt! Not a butt!

650
00:33:11,762 --> 00:33:14,198
他知道屁股是什么吗？
Does he know what a butt is?

651
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:16,067
正如我刚才所说
As I was saying,

652
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,036
在外面，你们五个是反派
on the outside, the five of you are villains,

653
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,138
捕食者，无情的反社会者
predators, remorseless sociopaths.

654
00:33:21,272 --> 00:33:23,340
哦，别说了。你让我脸红了
Oh, stop. You're making me blush.

655
00:33:23,474 --> 00:33:25,209
但里面有一朵花--
But inside, there's a flower--

656
00:33:25,342 --> 00:33:28,179
善良之花——当它绽放的时候
the flower of goodness-- and when it blooms

657
00:33:28,312 --> 00:33:30,714
你会感觉到那种积极的刺激
and you feel that tingle of positivity

658
00:33:30,847 --> 00:33:32,349
辐射穿过你的身体
radiating through your body,

659
00:33:32,483 --> 00:33:35,552
你会想一直感受到的
you're going to want to feel it all the time.

660
00:33:35,686 --> 00:33:37,354
所以我们要去刺激一下？
So we're going for a tingle?

661
00:33:37,488 --> 00:33:38,689
没有刺痛感
Not any tingle.

662
00:33:38,822 --> 00:33:40,924
善良的刺痛，你会感觉到
The tingle of goodness, which you'll feel

663
00:33:41,058 --> 00:33:44,295
在我最先进的共享实验室里
in my state-of-the-art Sharing Laboratory.

664
00:33:44,428 --> 00:33:48,332
好的，斯内克先生，我来推你一下
Okay, Mr. Snake, I'm going to give you a Push Pop.

665
00:33:48,465 --> 00:33:50,901
太棒了帮我推一下！
Great! Push Pop just for me!

666
00:33:51,034 --> 00:33:53,637
-不，分享-为什么？
-No, to share. -Why?

667
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,639
从根本上说，
Well, on a fundamental level,

668
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:57,741
这是为了满足别人的需求
it's about putting someone else's needs

669
00:33:57,874 --> 00:34:00,211
-领先于你自己
-ahead of your own. 

670
00:34:00,344 --> 00:34:02,079
哦，不，不可能
Oh, no. No way.

671
00:34:02,213 --> 00:34:03,947
蛇
Snake.

672
00:34:04,081 --> 00:34:06,683
好吧，好吧
All right, all right.

673
00:34:06,817 --> 00:34:08,685
这味道会特别甜
This is going to taste extra sweet,

674
00:34:08,819 --> 00:34:11,322
因为我知道你有多想要它
'cause I know how bad you want it.

675
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,726
请给我开门。啊。。。
Pop me, please. Ah...

676
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,465
不。笨蛋
Nope. Sucker.

677
00:34:21,598 --> 00:34:22,699
就这样
That's it! 

678
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:24,601
我会教你分享
I'll teach you to share! 

679
00:34:26,036 --> 00:34:28,038
我喜欢分享。很好吃。嗯
Mm, I like sharing. It's yummy. Mm.

680
00:34:28,172 --> 00:34:29,873
完全值得。
Totally worth it.

681
00:34:30,006 --> 00:34:32,109
太可怕了。
Well, that's terrifying.

682
00:34:32,243 --> 00:34:34,178
让我们试试更简单的。
Let's try something simpler.

683
00:34:34,311 --> 00:34:36,713
一个好人总是注意的
A good person always pays attention

684
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:38,182
满足他人的需求
to the needs of others.

685
00:34:38,315 --> 00:34:40,851
现在，这里有一位慈祥体弱的奶奶
Now, here's a kindly, frail grandma.

686
00:34:42,986 --> 00:34:46,323
食人鱼先生，帮奶奶过马路
Mr. Piranha, help grandma across the street.

687
00:34:46,457 --> 00:34:49,226
当然，当然，当然。我一直都这么做
Sure, sure, sure. I do this all the time.

688
00:34:50,026 --> 00:34:52,829
-给你，女士
-Here you go, ma'am.

689
00:34:52,963 --> 00:34:54,798
他肯定会搞砸的
Oh, he is totally gonna blow it.

690
00:34:54,931 --> 00:34:56,333
那是什么？你说什么
What was that? What did you say

691
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:57,934
你觉得我做不到
You think I can't do this? 

692
00:34:58,068 --> 00:35:00,371
不，不，不，食人鱼
No, no, no, Piranha! 

693
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,309
也许更简单？
Maybe simpler?

694
00:35:07,511 --> 00:35:10,281
嘿，看。这是一只卡在树上的猫
Hey, look. It's a cat stuck in a tree.

695
00:35:10,414 --> 00:35:12,416
再简单不过了
It doesn't get much simpler than that.

696
00:35:12,549 --> 00:35:14,451
那么，在这种情况下呢
Now, what in this scenario

697
00:35:14,585 --> 00:35:16,487
会让你感到刺痛吗？
would give you that good tingle?

698
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,088
吃了吗？
Eating it?

699
00:35:18,222 --> 00:35:20,357
这就是为什么我总是随身携带两片面包。
This is why I always carry two pieces of bread with me.

700
00:35:20,491 --> 00:35:21,525
不
No.

701
00:35:21,658 --> 00:35:24,395
我想让你。。。
I want you to s...

702
00:35:24,528 --> 00:35:25,662
-打它-剥皮？
-Smack it. -Skin it?

703
00:35:25,796 --> 00:35:27,431
-刺伤它-煎一下-唱给它听？
-Stab it. -Sauté it. -Sing to it?

704
00:35:27,564 --> 00:35:29,333
省省吧。我要你说。。。
Save it. I want you to sa...

705
00:35:29,466 --> 00:35:31,602
这很明显。。。太明显了。。。我要你保存它
That's obv... It's so obvi... I want you to save it.

706
00:35:31,735 --> 00:35:33,003
哦！
Oh!

707
00:35:33,136 --> 00:35:34,905
-对，对-对，对，对。当然
-Right, right. -Right, right, right. Sure.

708
00:35:35,906 --> 00:35:38,475
来，凯蒂，凯蒂，凯蒂
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. 

709
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:41,545
哇，那只猫显然有缺陷。
Whoa, that cat is obviously defective.

710
00:35:41,678 --> 00:35:42,846
你怎么了？
What is wrong with you?

711
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:44,515
你会让它心脏病发作。
You're gonna give it a heart attack.

712
00:35:44,648 --> 00:35:46,317
我来处理。
I'll handle this.

713
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,420
怎么了，爸爸
What's up, papa! 

714
00:35:51,054 --> 00:35:53,357
把他从我脸上弄下来！他在我脸上！
Get him off my face! He's on my face!

715
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,659
不，不，不，不，不，听着！你在干什么？
No, no, no, no, no, listen! Wh-What are you doing?

716
00:36:00,464 --> 00:36:04,000
可以请问你擅长什么？
Okay. What, may I ask, are you good at?

717
00:36:04,134 --> 00:36:05,636
偷东西。
Stealing stuff.

718
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:06,837
哦，是的，我们很擅长
Oh, yeah, we're great at that.

719
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:07,938
-抢劫-盗窃罪。
-Robbery. -Larceny.

720
00:36:08,071 --> 00:36:09,139
-电报诈骗-勒索
-Wire fraud. -Extortion.

721
00:36:09,273 --> 00:36:10,641
-逃税-抢劫
-Tax evasion. -Heists.

722
00:36:10,774 --> 00:36:12,509
邮件诈骗-等待你说是抢劫？
Mail fraud. -Wait. Heists, you say?

723
00:36:12,643 --> 00:36:14,978
那是。。。是的，这是我们的特色菜
Well, that's... yeah, that's kind of our specialty.

724
00:36:15,111 --> 00:36:17,581
我可能有个主意
I might just have an idea.

725
00:36:17,714 --> 00:36:20,951
解放猪！放了猪！
Free the pigs! Free the pigs!

726
00:36:21,084 --> 00:36:23,787
那是一个动物测试实验室
That is an animal testing lab.

727
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,357
二十万只无助的豚鼠
Within, 200,000 helpless guinea pigs,

728
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:30,494
所有这些都被虐待狂科学家戳戳戳
all being poked and prodded by sadistic scientists.

729
00:36:30,627 --> 00:36:31,895
你说豚鼠？
Guinea pigs, you say?

730
00:36:32,028 --> 00:36:33,497
蛇
Snake.

731
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,898
我要你去救他们
I want you to rescue them.

732
00:36:35,031 --> 00:36:37,033
但这是一次永久的抢劫
But this is a heist for good,

733
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:40,537
所以我带了更友好的衣服给你穿
so I brought something more friendly for you to wear.

734
00:36:40,671 --> 00:36:42,839
再见
Bye.

735
00:36:42,973 --> 00:36:44,741
好吧，我们的街头信誉就这样消失了
Well, there goes our street cred.

736
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:46,543
至少很舒服
At least it's comfy.

737
00:36:48,178 --> 00:36:51,014
好吧，我们需要转移那个科学家的注意力
All right, we need to distract that scientist.

738
00:36:51,147 --> 00:36:53,116
你起来了-收到
you're up. -Copy that.

739
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,352
可以我们需要一根绳子和一个钩子
Okay. We're gonna need a rope and a hook.

740
00:36:55,486 --> 00:36:57,053
-我有这个-其他人：什么？
-I got this one. -OTHERS: What?

741
00:36:57,187 --> 00:36:58,322
你是志愿者吗？
You're volunteering?

742
00:36:58,455 --> 00:37:00,023
你从来没有自愿做过任何事
You've never volunteered for anything.

743
00:37:00,156 --> 00:37:01,825
当然有。马上
Sure, I did. Right now.

744
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:04,094
-呃-把我扔上去。吉迪亚普！
-Uh... -Throw me up there. Giddyap!

745
00:37:04,227 --> 00:37:05,596
-真的吗-是的
-Really? -Yep.

746
00:37:05,729 --> 00:37:07,264
我百分之九十九相信你能做到
I'm 99% sure you can make it.

747
00:37:07,398 --> 00:37:09,165
-好的-来吧！
-Okay. -Let's do it!

748
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:11,568
嘿，儿子
Hey there, son.

749
00:37:11,702 --> 00:37:12,769
爸爸
Dad?

750
00:37:12,903 --> 00:37:14,471
我知道你有一份重要的工作
I know you've got an important job,

751
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:17,007
但我希望你还有时间跟你老爸聊聊
but I hope you still have time for a catch with your old man.

752
00:37:18,642 --> 00:37:20,277
-嘿，孩子-嗯-96%确定
-Hey, kiddo. -Huh? -SNAKE: 96% sure.

753
00:37:20,411 --> 00:37:22,078
你永远是我特别的男孩
You'll always be my special boy.

754
00:37:22,212 --> 00:37:23,614
啊
Aw. 

755
00:37:23,747 --> 00:37:25,181
大概百分之九十
Maybe 90%.

756
00:37:25,316 --> 00:37:27,651
我一生都在等待这一刻
I've been waiting my entire life for this moment.

757
00:37:27,784 --> 00:37:29,953
我不知道-可以现在，继续
I don't know. -Okay. Now, go long.

758
00:37:30,086 --> 00:37:31,655
哦，孩子，哦，孩子，哦，孩子！
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

759
00:37:31,788 --> 00:37:34,791
谢谢你，爸爸！
Thank you, Daddy! 

760
00:37:34,925 --> 00:37:37,328
五十。。。今天是星期几？
50... What day is it?

761
00:37:37,461 --> 00:37:38,595
我是谁？
Who am I?

762
00:37:38,729 --> 00:37:40,331
对。豚鼠被锁上了
Right. The guinea pigs are locked

763
00:37:40,464 --> 00:37:42,333
在一扇三英尺厚的钢门后面
behind a three-foot-thick steel door.

764
00:37:42,466 --> 00:37:44,535
只有通过通风口才能进去
The only way in is through the vents.

765
00:37:44,668 --> 00:37:46,236
我进去了
I got it.

766
00:37:48,372 --> 00:37:50,073
我从未见过他如此爽朗
I have never seen him so chipper.

767
00:37:50,206 --> 00:37:51,908
他一直在冥想吗？
Has he been meditating?

768
00:38:00,584 --> 00:38:01,985
哦
Oh.

769
00:38:02,118 --> 00:38:04,488
蛇行动
Snake attack.

770
00:38:05,288 --> 00:38:07,157
哦嘿，看，我是迈拉迪教授
Oh. Hey, look, it's Professor Marmalade.

771
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,593
是的，没错。是我
Yes, that's right. It's me.

772
00:38:09,726 --> 00:38:11,061
救援已经到来
Help has arrived.

773
00:38:11,194 --> 00:38:13,397
把你的眼睛盯着那扇门
Just keep your eyes glued to that door.

774
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,500
蛇来吧，蛇。开门
Snake. Come on, Snake. Open up.

775
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:17,834
放松
Relax.

776
00:38:17,968 --> 00:38:20,103
这些门很复杂
These doors are complicated.

777
00:38:20,236 --> 00:38:22,005
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me? 

778
00:38:22,138 --> 00:38:23,407
你以为你在干什么？
What do you think you're doing?

779
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,241
我们应该拯救它们，而不是吃掉它们
We're supposed to save them, not eat them.

780
00:38:25,376 --> 00:38:27,878
我得说他们去了一个更好的地方
Well, I'd say they've gone to a better place.

781
00:38:29,279 --> 00:38:30,347
好了，就这样
All right, that's it.

782
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:31,982
-吐出来-嘿
-Spit them out. -Hey.

783
00:38:32,115 --> 00:38:33,684
嘿！
Hey!

784
00:38:33,817 --> 00:38:35,352
不管你喜不喜欢我们都会救你的
We gonna save you whether you like it or not.

785
00:38:35,486 --> 00:38:37,020
我们在救你，你们这些蠢货
We're saving you, you stupid hair balls.

786
00:38:37,153 --> 00:38:39,390
不是那扇门。另一扇门
Not that door. The other door.

787
00:38:40,256 --> 00:38:41,358
嘿，嘿
Hey, hey. 

788
00:38:41,492 --> 00:38:42,359
哇！
Whoa!

789
00:38:42,493 --> 00:38:43,627
随时可以
Any second.

790
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,839
这不是它看起来的样子
It-it's not what it looks like.

791
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:05,682
侵入、入室盗窃
Trespassing, burglary, mayhem,

792
00:39:05,816 --> 00:39:07,951
用致命的爬行动物袭击？
assault with a deadly reptile?

793
00:39:08,084 --> 00:39:09,586
好像那些可怜的啮齿动物
As if those poor rodents

794
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,588
经历的还不够
haven't been through enough already.

795
00:39:11,722 --> 00:39:12,856
不，黛安，求你了
No, Diane, please.

796
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:14,558
好的
Okay.

797
00:39:14,691 --> 00:39:17,528
对不起，教授，我要给主任打电话
I'm sorry, Professor, but I'm calling the chief.

798
00:39:17,661 --> 00:39:18,495
请来吧
Please. Come on.

799
00:39:18,629 --> 00:39:19,896
这个实验结束了
This experiment is over.

800
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,931
实验需要时间
Experiments take time.

801
00:39:21,064 --> 00:39:22,265
你忍不住？
You couldn't help yourself?

802
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:23,700
所以我有点软弱。起诉我
So I had a moment of weakness. Sue me.

803
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:25,536
这在监狱里很难做到
That's gonna be difficult to do from prison.

804
00:39:25,669 --> 00:39:27,804
伙计们，我们现在该怎么办？
Guys, what do we do now?

805
00:39:29,506 --> 00:39:33,109
是时候发起魅力攻势了
Hmm. Time to launch a charm offensive.

806
00:39:33,243 --> 00:39:36,747
哦，是的。完整的克鲁尼
Oh, yeah. The full Clooney.

807
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,682
总督女士
Madam Governor.

808
00:39:38,815 --> 00:39:39,783
黛安
Diane.

809
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:41,418
别耍我，狼
Do not Clooney me, Wolf.

810
00:39:41,552 --> 00:39:43,754
哦，我明白了。你觉得我还是个坏人
Oh, I see what's going on. You think I'm still a Bad Guy,

811
00:39:43,887 --> 00:39:46,122
试图欺骗我的自由之路
trying to bamboozle my way to freedom.

812
00:39:46,256 --> 00:39:47,758
但我们变了
But we've changed.

813
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:50,226
善良之花正在遍地开花
That flower of goodness is blossoming all over the place.

814
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,063
你不厌倦撒谎吗？
Don't you ever get tired of lying?

815
00:39:53,196 --> 00:39:54,731
不
 No.

816
00:39:54,865 --> 00:39:56,099
我是说。。。软糖
I mean...  Fudge.

817
00:39:56,232 --> 00:39:57,734
那是。。。那是个诡计问题，对吧？
That was... that was a trick question, right?

818
00:39:57,868 --> 00:40:00,771
我给了你一个机会
I gave you an opportunity--

819
00:40:00,904 --> 00:40:02,305
向全世界展示的机会
a chance to show the world

820
00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:04,608
你不仅仅是一个可怕的刻板印象--
that you're more than just a scary stereotype--

821
00:40:04,741 --> 00:40:06,543
但你太骄傲了
but you're too proud

822
00:40:06,677 --> 00:40:09,145
或者太没勇气利用它
or too gutless to take advantage of it.

823
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:11,047
胆小鬼？我没有勇气？
Gutless? I'm gutless?

824
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:12,282
哦
Oh.

825
00:40:12,415 --> 00:40:13,817
对不起，我们见过面吗？
I'm sorry, have we met?

826
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,285
我是每个故事的反派
I'm the villain of every story.

827
00:40:15,418 --> 00:40:16,653
在被证明无罪之前是有罪的
Guilty until proven innocent.

828
00:40:16,787 --> 00:40:19,890
即使我们奇迹般地改变了
Even if by some miracle we did change,

829
00:40:20,023 --> 00:40:21,725
谁会相信我们？
who's gonna believe us, huh?

830
00:40:21,858 --> 00:40:23,660
你当然不知道这件事
Of course you wouldn't know anything about that,

831
00:40:23,794 --> 00:40:27,664
穿上你的完美女装
with your Little Miss Perfect power suits.

832
00:40:28,665 --> 00:40:29,866
是这样吗？
Is that so?

833
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,468
等等
Wait a second.

834
00:40:31,602 --> 00:40:33,269
你做了什么。。。你怎么。。。
What did... How did you...

835
00:40:33,403 --> 00:40:37,641
狼和狐狸没什么不同
A wolf and a fox are not so different.

836
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:40,777
也许他们会相信你，也许他们不会
Maybe they will believe you, maybe they won't,

837
00:40:40,911 --> 00:40:42,278
但这无关紧要
but it doesn't matter.

838
00:40:42,412 --> 00:40:44,715
不要为他们这么做。为你做吧
Don't do it for them. Do it for you.

839
00:40:44,848 --> 00:40:47,350
这是一个写自己故事的机会
This is a chance to write your own story.

840
00:40:47,484 --> 00:40:50,453
为你和你的朋友找到更好的生活
To find a better life for you and your friends.

841
00:40:51,254 --> 00:40:53,023
拜托，你会失去什么？
Come on, what have you got to lose?

842
00:40:53,156 --> 00:40:55,125
我不知道。我的尊严？
I don't know. My dignity?

843
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:59,696
是的，那艘船已经开航了
Yeah, well, that ship has already sailed.

844
00:41:05,669 --> 00:41:08,471
信不信由你，我支持你，沃尔夫
Believe it or not, I'm rooting for you, Wolf.

845
00:41:09,272 --> 00:41:11,441
你不给局长打电话了？
So you're not gonna call the chief?

846
00:41:12,242 --> 00:41:15,145
晚会上见
I'll see you at the gala. 

847
00:41:49,913 --> 00:41:52,282
我想我们的开始不太好
I think we got off to a bad start.

848
00:41:52,415 --> 00:41:54,417
名字叫沃尔夫
The name's Wolf.

849
00:41:57,087 --> 00:41:58,789
是的
Yep. 

850
00:41:58,922 --> 00:42:00,256
我知道很多
I get that a lot.

851
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,626
第一印象等等
First impressions and all.

852
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:07,898
不，不，不，不
No, no, no, no. 

853
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,039
没关系。没关系
Uh, it's okay. It's okay.

854
00:42:16,172 --> 00:42:18,108
我不会伤害你的。我知道你很害怕
I'm not gonna hurt you. I know you're scared.

855
00:42:18,241 --> 00:42:20,343
如果我是你，我也会的
I would be, too, if I were you.

856
00:42:21,277 --> 00:42:22,846
给我一个机会
Just give me a chance.

857
00:42:24,247 --> 00:42:27,217
事实上，我们有很多共同点
Truth is we actually have a lot in common.

858
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,219
不要告诉任何人
Don't tell anyone,

859
00:42:29,352 --> 00:42:32,088
但我喜欢一点点抓伤
but I love a little scratch

860
00:42:32,222 --> 00:42:34,390
就在我耳朵后面
on the spot behind my ears.

861
00:42:34,524 --> 00:42:36,226
你知道，就在那里
You know, right there.

862
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:38,428
最好的
The best.

863
00:42:43,033 --> 00:42:45,802
来吧，基蒂
Come on, kitty.

864
00:43:03,687 --> 00:43:06,022
-对。谁是一只好猫
-Yeah. Who's a good kitty? 

865
00:43:06,156 --> 00:43:08,058
-谁是一只好猫-狼蛛：嗯，狼？
-Who's a good kitty? -TARANTULA: Uh, Wolf?

866
00:43:08,191 --> 00:43:10,994
你救了他？
Um, you saved him?

867
00:43:11,127 --> 00:43:12,395
是的！
Yes!

868
00:43:12,528 --> 00:43:15,465
是的。它起作用了
Yes. It's working.

869
00:43:15,598 --> 00:43:16,833
你拍的？
You-you filmed that?

870
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:19,402
是的，他们开始喜欢你了
Yes, and they're starting to like you.

871
00:43:19,535 --> 00:43:20,570
是啊！
Yeah!

872
00:43:20,704 --> 00:43:22,438
好吧
All right! 

873
00:43:22,572 --> 00:43:23,707
这可能就足够了
This might just be enough

874
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,175
为了在晚会上赢得客人
to win over the guests at the gala.

875
00:43:25,308 --> 00:43:27,277
-现在我们在说话-是的-好吧
-Now we're talking! -Yes! -All right!

876
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:30,013
是的，我们做到了！好吧
Yeah, we did it! All right!

877
00:43:30,146 --> 00:43:31,782
嗯，狼？
Uh, Wolf?

878
00:43:31,915 --> 00:43:34,317
我必须说，你真的转过了一个弯
I must say, you've really turned a corner.

879
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,319
-你真的明白了-真正地
-You're really getting it. -Really?

880
00:43:36,452 --> 00:43:38,021
谢谢
Oh, uh, thanks.

881
00:43:38,154 --> 00:43:39,189
现在，我是认真的
Now, I mean it.

882
00:43:39,322 --> 00:43:41,257
我可以从头到尾看到它
And I can see it from tip to tail.

883
00:43:42,025 --> 00:43:45,561
真遗憾，你得背这么多行李
It's just a shame that you have to carry all that baggage.

884
00:43:46,429 --> 00:43:48,932
你在说什么。。。你是说那些家伙？
What are you talk... You mean the guys?

885
00:43:49,065 --> 00:43:50,333
什么意思？
What do you mean?

886
00:43:50,466 --> 00:43:51,835
你有很大的潜力，狼
MARMALADE: You have great potential, Wolf,

887
00:43:51,968 --> 00:43:53,436
但在某个时刻，你必须做出选择
but at some point, you're going to have to choose

888
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:56,707
在你的朋友或美好生活之间
between your friends or the good life.

889
00:44:05,581 --> 00:44:07,751
嘿你还醒着吗？
Hey. You still awake?

890
00:44:09,552 --> 00:44:11,121
你把猫带进来了？
You-you brought the cat in?

891
00:44:11,254 --> 00:44:12,956
是的。是的，是的
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

892
00:44:13,089 --> 00:44:15,025
我只是。。。我只是把它留着以后用
I'm just... I'm just saving it up for later.

893
00:44:15,158 --> 00:44:16,559
为什么？怎么了？
Why? What's up?

894
00:44:17,393 --> 00:44:19,029
我只是有点担心
I was just getting a little worried,

895
00:44:19,162 --> 00:44:20,831
既然你成了。。。
since you've kind of become a...

896
00:44:20,964 --> 00:44:22,933
成什么
Become a what? 

897
00:44:23,066 --> 00:44:25,101
你知道，老师的宠儿
You know, teacher's pet.

898
00:44:25,235 --> 00:44:27,437
吃果酱会很舒服
Getting all cozy with Marmalade.

899
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:29,539
你摇尾巴什么
Your tail wagging and everything.

900
00:44:29,672 --> 00:44:31,641
嗯，是的，因为它必须是可信的
Well, yeah, because it has to be believable.

901
00:44:31,775 --> 00:44:34,510
嗯哼。是的，我想是的
Uh-huh. Yeah, I guess so.

902
00:44:34,644 --> 00:44:37,247
只要这都是计划的一部分
As long as it's all part of the plan.

903
00:44:38,114 --> 00:44:40,683
这都是计划的一部分，不是吗？
It is all part of the plan, isn't it?

904
00:44:40,817 --> 00:44:43,954
斯内克，老兄，是谁先计划的？
Snake, buddy, who made the plan to begin with?

905
00:44:44,087 --> 00:44:45,488
是的
You did.

906
00:44:45,621 --> 00:44:49,092
所以我是最坚持计划的人，对吗？
So I'm the one who sticks to the plan the most, right?

907
00:44:50,727 --> 00:44:52,295
是啊，莉。。。嗯，是的，好吧。。。
Yeah, ri... Uh, yeah, ok...

908
00:44:52,428 --> 00:44:54,664
我想这是有道理的
I guess that makes sense, yeah.

909
00:44:54,798 --> 00:44:57,200
但如果计划要改变
But if the plan were ever to change,

910
00:44:57,333 --> 00:45:00,036
你会告诉我的，对吧？
you'd-you'd tell me, right?

911
00:45:02,538 --> 00:45:04,674
我向你保证
You have my word.

912
00:45:04,808 --> 00:45:06,843
变坏。。。
Go bad...

913
00:45:07,643 --> 00:45:09,545
或者回家
Or go home.

914
00:45:17,387 --> 00:45:19,555
-嘿，斯内克-是吗
-Hey, Snake. -Yeah? 

915
00:45:19,689 --> 00:45:21,892
你想过会是什么样子吗？
You ever wonder what it'd be like?

916
00:45:22,025 --> 00:45:24,694
世界爱我们而不是害怕我们？
The world loving us instead of being scared of us?

917
00:45:24,828 --> 00:45:26,729
你曾经。。。你想过吗？
You ever... you ever think about that?

918
00:45:26,863 --> 00:45:27,998
爱我们？
Loving us?

919
00:45:28,131 --> 00:45:29,532
是的，对
Yeah, right.

920
00:45:29,665 --> 00:45:31,601
我不会浪费时间去想事情
I don't waste time thinking about stuff

921
00:45:31,734 --> 00:45:33,269
那永远不会发生
that's never gonna happen.

922
00:45:33,403 --> 00:45:37,808
我等不及事情恢复正常了
I can't wait for things to get back to normal.

923
00:45:44,848 --> 00:45:47,450
是 啊恢复正常，恢复正常
Yeah. Back to normal, back to normal.

924
00:45:51,721 --> 00:45:53,824
<font color="#FFFF37">蒂芙尼·弗拉菲特的特别报道

925
00:45:55,959 --> 00:45:58,461
怎么了？我们就在眼前
What up? We are just moments away

926
00:45:58,594 --> 00:46:00,496
来自Marmalade教授的慈善晚会
from Professor Marmalade's Gala for Goodness,

927
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,665
传说中的爱情陨石坑
where the legendary Love Crater Meteorite

928
00:46:02,799 --> 00:46:05,802
将首次展出。
will be on display for the first time ever.

929
00:46:05,936 --> 00:46:08,571
但每个人都在谈论什么呢
But what everyone is really buzzing about

930
00:46:08,704 --> 00:46:12,042
是坏人，他们的心脏融化救援视频
is the Bad Guys, whose heart-melting rescue video

931
00:46:12,175 --> 00:46:16,012
让它们一夜之间引起了轰动
has made them an overnight viral sensation.

932
00:46:17,447 --> 00:46:19,482
好了，伙计们，这是个大问题
All right, guys, this is the big one.

933
00:46:19,615 --> 00:46:21,217
金色海豚
The Golden Dolphin

934
00:46:21,351 --> 00:46:22,819
在一个钛壳里
is inside a titanium case

935
00:46:22,953 --> 00:46:24,787
由随机生成的五位数代码控制
controlled by a randomly generated five-digit code,

936
00:46:24,921 --> 00:46:26,456
确保安全的代码
a code kept safe and secure

937
00:46:26,589 --> 00:46:29,492
在一个手铐着警察局长的公文包里
inside a briefcase handcuffed to the chief of police.

938
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:31,494
她不是在胡闹
She's not messing around.

939
00:46:31,627 --> 00:46:33,196
代码只能通过
The code is only accessible with

940
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:34,931
-她的授权指纹-把这个交给我吧
-her authorized fingerprints. -SNAKE: Leave that to me.

941
00:46:35,065 --> 00:46:37,000
当蛇得到密码时
While Snake gets the code,

942
00:46:37,133 --> 00:46:38,501
鲨鱼会保护假海豚
Shark will secure the fake Dolphin.

943
00:46:38,634 --> 00:46:40,236
我喜欢这声音
I like the sound of that.

944
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:42,105
与此同时，我们其他人在安装电路干扰器
Meanwhile, the rest of us plant circuit jammers.

945
00:46:42,238 --> 00:46:44,207
允许我侵入电网
Allowing me to hack into the power grid.

946
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,909
晚上结束时，我们向教授敬酒
WOLF: At the end of the night, we toast the professor,

947
00:46:46,042 --> 00:46:47,944
我会说一大堆废话
"Blah-blah-blah, yada yada,"

948
00:46:48,078 --> 00:46:50,480
当我说“果酱”的时候，灯就熄灭了
and when I say "Marmalade," lights go out,

949
00:46:50,613 --> 00:46:53,416
我们只有四秒钟的时间行动
and we'll have exactly four seconds to make our move.

950
00:46:53,549 --> 00:46:55,451
那个老开关。
The old switcheroo.

951
00:46:55,585 --> 00:46:58,254
酋长把果酱递给假海豚
Chief hands Marmalade the fake Dolphin,

952
00:46:58,388 --> 00:47:01,357
我们得到了赦免，掌声，掌声，退出舞台
we get our pardon, applause, applause, exit stage right,

953
00:47:01,491 --> 00:47:03,960
当他们意识到发生了什么时。。。
and by the time they realize what happened...

954
00:47:04,094 --> 00:47:05,661
再见，笨蛋！
So long, suckers!

955
00:47:05,795 --> 00:47:07,430
我们将驶向日落
we'll be driving off into the sunset,

956
00:47:07,563 --> 00:47:08,731
遗产得到巩固
legacy cemented.

957
00:47:08,865 --> 00:47:10,200
很好
PIRANHA: Nice.

958
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:11,601
我得把它交给你，伙计
Got to hand it to you, buddy.

959
00:47:11,734 --> 00:47:13,669
你真是个艺术家
You're a real artist.

960
00:47:16,272 --> 00:47:18,208
好了，伙计们，就是这样
Well, Good Guys, this is it.

961
00:47:18,341 --> 00:47:19,742
祝你好运
Good luck out there.

962
00:47:19,876 --> 00:47:23,713
记住，今晚所有的眼睛都会盯着你，而不是我。
Remember, all eyes will be on you tonight, not me.

963
00:47:23,846 --> 00:47:27,717
朋友们，见见好人！
Friends, meet the Good Guys!

964
00:47:33,423 --> 00:47:35,425
这不一样
Uh, this is different.

965
00:47:35,558 --> 00:47:37,527
-这是恶作剧吗-那是什么声音？
-Is this a prank? -What's that sound?

966
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,729
像尖叫但不害怕
Like screaming but not terrified.

967
00:47:39,862 --> 00:47:42,698
好了，伙计们，我们。。。我们混在一起吧
All right, guys, let's, uh... let's mingle.

968
00:47:42,832 --> 00:47:45,001
现在是犯罪时间，宝贝
It's crime time, baby.

969
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:51,041
-嗯-好了
-Hmm? -There you go.

970
00:47:57,247 --> 00:47:59,315
好吧，假海豚，假海豚，假海豚
Okay, fake Dolphin, fake Dolphin, fake Dolphin.

971
00:47:59,449 --> 00:48:00,650
答对了
Bingo.

972
00:48:00,783 --> 00:48:02,785
-鲨鱼先生，鲨鱼先生-哦！
-Mr. Shark, Mr. Shark! -Ooh!

973
00:48:02,919 --> 00:48:05,188
鲨鱼真的能闻到一英里外的血吗？
Is it true sharks can smell blood a mile away?

974
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:07,457
什么不，这太奇怪了
What? No. That's freaky.

975
00:48:13,096 --> 00:48:14,830
-哦，狼先生！沃尔夫先生-嘿。哇
-Oh, Mr. Wolf! Mr. Wolf!  Hey. Whoa.

976
00:48:14,965 --> 00:48:16,299
很高兴见到你。
It is a pleasure to meet you.

977
00:48:16,432 --> 00:48:18,234
-这是我的荣幸-我喜欢你的视频。
-Pleasure is all mine. -I loved your video.

978
00:48:18,368 --> 00:48:20,170
我能给我的孩子们照张相吗？
Can I get a picture for my kids?

979
00:48:20,303 --> 00:48:22,705
等一下，伙计们。让我。。。让我，呃。。。
Uh, hey, just a minute, guys. Let me... let me, uh...

980
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:25,141
我有。。。我马上回来
I got... I'll be right back.

981
00:48:27,577 --> 00:48:31,681
好了，沃尔夫，你在忙什么？
Okay, Wolf, what are you up to?

982
00:48:32,648 --> 00:48:34,684
对，像这样的罪犯
Yeah, with criminals like this,

983
00:48:34,817 --> 00:48:38,154
你必须狡猾、微妙、隐形
you got to be crafty, subtle, invisible.

984
00:48:38,288 --> 00:48:41,624
然后当他们放松警惕的时候。。。
And then the moment they let their guard down...

985
00:48:41,757 --> 00:48:43,726
哇
whammo! 

986
00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:45,061
你必须跳出陷阱！
You gotta spring the trap!

987
00:48:45,195 --> 00:48:47,630
总是领先一步
Always one step ahead.

988
00:48:47,763 --> 00:48:50,266
我想我已经赚了一杯补水
I think I've earned a tonic water.

989
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,568
把它放在有趣的杯子里，嗯？
Put it in a fun glass, huh?

990
00:48:52,702 --> 00:48:54,504
哦美好的
Oh! Nice.

991
00:48:56,506 --> 00:48:58,108
哦，不
Oh, no. 

992
00:48:58,241 --> 00:49:00,010
嘿
Hey. 

993
00:49:06,616 --> 00:49:08,118
这是正确的
That's right.

994
00:49:08,251 --> 00:49:10,286
被吓倒
Be intimidated. 

995
00:49:11,421 --> 00:49:12,989
嗯
Mm.

996
00:49:14,657 --> 00:49:15,992
不，不，不，不，不，不，不，不！
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

997
00:49:23,433 --> 00:49:24,500
-什么-隐马尔可夫模型？
-What? -Hmm?

998
00:50:11,347 --> 00:50:12,348
沃尔夫先生
Mr. Wolf.

999
00:50:12,482 --> 00:50:14,150
黛安。是啊，真是个惊喜
Diane. Yeah, what a surprise.

1000
00:50:14,284 --> 00:50:15,751
如果我不知道的话
You know, if I didn't know better,

1001
00:50:15,885 --> 00:50:17,287
我以为你在躲避我
I'd think that you were avoiding me.

1002
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:18,621
避开你？
Avoiding you?

1003
00:50:18,754 --> 00:50:20,423
我为什么要这么做？
Wh-Why would I do that?

1004
00:50:21,424 --> 00:50:22,792
可以
Okay.

1005
00:50:22,925 --> 00:50:26,462
但我不得不说，我有点失望
But I have to say, I'm a little disappointed.

1006
00:50:27,263 --> 00:50:30,233
我希望你能邀请我跳舞
I was hoping you were gonna ask me to dance.

1007
00:50:30,366 --> 00:50:31,567
哦
Oh.

1008
00:50:52,488 --> 00:50:55,291
我懂了。你丢了羊皮
I see. You lost the sheep's clothing.

1009
00:50:55,425 --> 00:50:58,328
是 啊我觉得是时候穿上自己的皮草了
Yeah. Figured it was time I got comfortable in my own fur.

1010
00:50:58,461 --> 00:51:00,096
如果你在这里感觉很好。。。
If you're feeling good in here...

1011
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:02,565
我说，如果你在这里感觉良好。。。
I said, if you're feeling good in here...

1012
00:51:05,601 --> 00:51:07,002
我想我喜欢新的你
I think I like the new you.

1013
00:51:07,137 --> 00:51:08,571
好吧，那就是我们两个人
Well, that makes two of us.

1014
00:51:35,765 --> 00:51:39,034
拿出雨伞，因为正在下雨
Break out the umbrellas, because it's raining money.

1015
00:51:39,169 --> 00:51:41,604
都是因为我不敢相信我会这么说--
All because of-- I can't even believe I'm saying this--

1016
00:51:41,737 --> 00:51:44,340
都是因为坏人
all because of the Bad Guys.

1017
00:51:59,722 --> 00:52:01,457
那么，感觉如何
So, how does it feel

1018
00:52:01,591 --> 00:52:04,294
让每个人都不害怕你的改变？
to have everyone not fear you for a change?

1019
00:52:12,034 --> 00:52:14,504
感觉很好
It feels good.

1020
00:52:14,637 --> 00:52:16,105
真的很好
Real good.

1021
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:17,840
黛安。。。
Diane...

1022
00:52:21,477 --> 00:52:23,313
它属于你
It belongs to you.

1023
00:52:51,774 --> 00:52:53,443
非常感谢。谢谢你，沃尔夫先生
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Wolf.

1024
00:52:53,576 --> 00:52:55,144
正如你所知，今晚筹集的资金
As you know, the money raised tonight

1025
00:52:55,278 --> 00:52:58,281
将于明天送到学校和医院
will be delivered tomorrow to schools, hospitals

1026
00:52:58,414 --> 00:53:00,450
以及全市其他有价值的事业
and other worthy causes across the city.

1027
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:07,156
我只想花点时间来认识一下
I just want to take a moment to recognize

1028
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:09,425
对我们的新观点负责的人。
the one responsible for our new outlook.

1029
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:12,061
我们杰出的导师，
Our brilliant mentor,

1030
00:53:12,194 --> 00:53:13,796
-启蒙的典范-去做吧-来吧
-a paragon of enlightenment... -Do it. -Come on.

1031
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:16,932
唯一的教授...
he one and only Professor...

1032
00:53:19,569 --> 00:53:21,737
狼，去吧-教授...
Wolf, do it. -Professor...

1033
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:29,445
迈拉迪教授！
Professor Marmalade!

1034
00:53:32,114 --> 00:53:34,384
警长，我能为您效劳吗？
Chief, may I do the honors?

1035
00:53:37,553 --> 00:53:38,688
这不是计划
That's not the plan.

1036
00:53:38,821 --> 00:53:39,855
发生了什么事？
What is happening?

1037
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:41,391
他变得无赖了
He's gone rogue.

1038
00:53:42,858 --> 00:53:44,694
交易就是交易
A deal's a deal.

1039
00:53:45,728 --> 00:53:48,564
凭借赋予我的权力，这是我的荣幸
By the power vested in me, it is a pleasure

1040
00:53:48,698 --> 00:53:51,200
给坏人一个完整的标准。。。
to grant the Bad Guys a full par...

1041
00:53:55,237 --> 00:53:57,807
-真奇怪-陨石不见了！
-That was weird. -MAN: The meteorite is gone!

1042
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,309
有人偷了！
Somebody stole it!

1043
00:54:01,877 --> 00:54:03,279
酋长
Chief.

1044
00:54:03,413 --> 00:54:05,281
-狼。-来吧。
-Wolf.  -Come on.

1045
00:54:05,415 --> 00:54:07,049
你不可能认为是我们干的。
You can't possibly think that we did this.

1046
00:54:07,182 --> 00:54:09,385
再见，笨蛋！
So long, suckers!

1047
00:54:10,486 --> 00:54:11,887
跑
Run!

1048
00:54:12,021 --> 00:54:13,356
抓住他们！
Get them!

1049
00:54:26,802 --> 00:54:28,471
在这里在这里
Here. Here.

1050
00:54:28,604 --> 00:54:31,173
-你在干什么-我要把一切都还给你
-What are you doing? -I'm giving it all back.

1051
00:54:31,307 --> 00:54:32,408
嗯？
Huh?

1052
00:54:32,542 --> 00:54:34,610
对不起
Excuse me.

1053
00:54:37,647 --> 00:54:40,149
-后面发生了什么-我做不到
-What happened back there? -I couldn't do it.

1054
00:54:40,282 --> 00:54:42,017
你不能做是什么意思？
What do you mean, you couldn't do it?

1055
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:43,419
-我只是。。。我-不
-I-I-I just... I... -No!

1056
00:54:43,553 --> 00:54:45,855
我不跑
I do not run. 

1057
00:54:45,988 --> 00:54:47,657
我不是这样滚的
That is not how I roll.

1058
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:49,592
食人鱼，不要做任何疯狂的事
Piranha, don't do anything crazy.

1059
00:54:51,193 --> 00:54:54,497
疯狂是我在派对上带来的，奇科
Crazy is what I bring to the party, chico.

1060
00:55:02,372 --> 00:55:03,739
嘿，你搞错了
Hey, you're making a mistake.

1061
00:55:03,873 --> 00:55:04,840
不是我们干的
We didn't do it.

1062
00:55:04,974 --> 00:55:06,108
我知道我们总是这么说
I know we always say that,

1063
00:55:06,241 --> 00:55:07,309
但这次是真的
but this time it's actually true.

1064
00:55:07,443 --> 00:55:09,311
啦啦啦啦。听不见
A-la-la-la-la. Can't hear you.

1065
00:55:09,445 --> 00:55:11,547
-有罪，有罪，有罪-和果酱谈谈
-Guilty, guilty, guilty. -Talk to Marmalade.

1066
00:55:11,681 --> 00:55:13,483
我们现在真的很好。他会告诉你的
We're really good now. He'll tell you.

1067
00:55:13,616 --> 00:55:14,717
教授
Professor!

1068
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:17,119
今晚的标题是：改变是不可能的
Tonight's headline: Change is impossible.

1069
00:55:17,252 --> 00:55:19,121
你应该根据封面来判断一本书，
You should always judge a book by its cover,

1070
00:55:19,254 --> 00:55:21,491
所有的刻板印象都得到了肯定
and all stereotypes have been affirmed.

1071
00:55:21,624 --> 00:55:23,225
橘子酱：停下来，看在上帝的份上！
MARMALADE: Stop, for goodness' sake!

1072
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:24,660
让我和他们谈谈
Let me speak to them.

1073
00:55:24,794 --> 00:55:27,329
我肯定有些误会
I'm-I'm sure there's been some misunderstanding.

1074
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:30,265
啊，迈拉迪教授
Ah, Professor Marmalade.

1075
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,767
你还有五分钟
You've got five minutes.

1076
00:55:31,901 --> 00:55:33,903
这次没有交易
No deals this time.

1077
00:55:34,036 --> 00:55:35,070
你必须帮助我们
Y-You have to help us.

1078
00:55:35,204 --> 00:55:36,739
告诉他们，告诉他们我们没有这么做
Tell 'em. Tell 'em we didn't do it.

1079
00:55:36,872 --> 00:55:38,741
好了，好了。当然不是你干的。
There, there. Of course you didn't do it.

1080
00:55:38,874 --> 00:55:40,009
你怎么能？
How could you?

1081
00:55:40,142 --> 00:55:43,513
毕竟，你是个好孩子
After all, you're such a good boy.

1082
00:55:44,313 --> 00:55:47,683
你真是个好孩子
You're such a good boy.

1083
00:55:47,817 --> 00:55:49,519
让我脊梁骨颤抖
That shiver up my spine.

1084
00:55:49,652 --> 00:55:51,887
我的小尾巴在摇摆
The wag in my tiny tail.

1085
00:55:52,021 --> 00:55:53,255
逮捕他们！
Arrest them!

1086
00:55:53,389 --> 00:55:55,157
如果我们做个小实验呢，黛安？
What if we tried a little experiment, Diane?

1087
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:57,593
如你所知，我为上帝举办的晚会。。。
As you know, my Gala for Goodness...

1088
00:55:57,727 --> 00:55:59,962
传说中的爱情陨石坑
Where the legendary Love Crater Meteorite

1089
00:56:00,095 --> 00:56:02,632
将首次展出
will be on display for the first time ever.

1090
00:56:02,765 --> 00:56:06,068
今晚所有的目光都会聚焦在你身上，而不是我
All eyes will be on you tonight, not me.

1091
00:56:06,902 --> 00:56:08,137
你真是个。。。
You're such a...

1092
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:10,573
好孩子。
Good boy.

1093
00:56:11,574 --> 00:56:12,975
你
You.

1094
00:56:13,108 --> 00:56:14,677
全是你
It was all you.

1095
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:16,211
你在说什么，狼？
What are you talking about, Wolf?

1096
00:56:16,345 --> 00:56:17,613
老太太，金色海豚
The old lady, the Golden Dolphin,

1097
00:56:17,747 --> 00:56:19,482
很好的训练让我们来到这里
good training-- it was all to get us here,

1098
00:56:19,615 --> 00:56:21,851
这样他就能偷走陨石，让我们承担责任
so he could steal the meteorite and let us take the fall.

1099
00:56:21,984 --> 00:56:23,653
哇。哇，什么老太太？
Whoa. Whoa, what old lady?

1100
00:56:23,786 --> 00:56:26,288
为什么豚鼠想要陨石呢？
And-and why would a guinea pig want a meteorite anyway?

1101
00:56:29,324 --> 00:56:32,127
伙计们，他吓到我了
Uh, guys, he's creeping me out.

1102
00:56:32,261 --> 00:56:33,863
等等，什么？发生什么事？
Wait, what? What's going on?

1103
00:56:33,996 --> 00:56:35,264
有人把我转过来
Someone turn me around.

1104
00:56:35,397 --> 00:56:37,032
好吧，好吧
Well, well.

1105
00:56:37,166 --> 00:56:39,068
所以，你终于明白了
So, you finally get it.

1106
00:56:39,201 --> 00:56:40,603
-等等-什么
-Wait. -What?

1107
00:56:40,736 --> 00:56:42,204
你偷了陨石？
You stole the meteorite?

1108
00:56:42,337 --> 00:56:44,306
哦，不仅仅是陨石
Oh, it's not just a meteorite.

1109
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,875
我告诉过你们这是个屁股
I told you guys it's a butt.

1110
00:56:46,008 --> 00:56:47,209
不是屁股！
It's not a butt!

1111
00:56:48,678 --> 00:56:51,146
它是终极的能源
It's the ultimate power source.

1112
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,149
你看，当它来袭时，科学家们发现
You see, when it struck, scientists found that

1113
00:56:54,283 --> 00:56:56,018
它发出电磁频率
it emitted an electromagnetic frequency

1114
00:56:56,151 --> 00:56:58,087
不像地球上的任何东西
unlike anything else on Earth.

1115
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,889
我要利用它的力量
I'm going to harness its power

1116
00:57:00,022 --> 00:57:03,225
完成了世界上最大的抢劫案
to pull off the greatest heist the world has ever seen.

1117
00:57:04,026 --> 00:57:05,961
你应该在有机会的时候吃掉他
You should've eaten him when you had the chance.

1118
00:57:06,095 --> 00:57:07,563
-是的-但为什么是我们？
-Yep. -But why us?

1119
00:57:07,697 --> 00:57:09,932
因为你是完美的替罪羊
Because you're the perfect patsies.

1120
00:57:10,065 --> 00:57:13,536
拜托，当人们在字典里查“bad”的时候
Come on, when people look up "bad" in the dictionary,

1121
00:57:13,669 --> 00:57:16,138
他们看到一只可爱的豚鼠了吗？
do they see a sweet, adorable guinea pig?

1122
00:57:16,271 --> 00:57:18,140
不，他们看见你了
No. They see you.

1123
00:57:18,273 --> 00:57:20,510
他们永远都会
And they always will.

1124
00:57:20,643 --> 00:57:21,911
好吧，好吧
Okay, fine.

1125
00:57:22,044 --> 00:57:23,312
但你陷害了我们
But you set us up.

1126
00:57:23,445 --> 00:57:24,714
哦
Oh

1127
00:57:24,847 --> 00:57:27,683
说实话，进化让你陷害了
Let's be honest-- evolution set you up.

1128
00:57:27,817 --> 00:57:30,019
但这里的Wolfie真的做到了
But Wolfie here really clinched it.

1129
00:57:30,152 --> 00:57:32,955
你落入了我的每一个陷阱
You fell for every one of my traps,

1130
00:57:33,088 --> 00:57:36,892
从救一个无助的小老太太开始
starting with saving a helpless little old lady.

1131
00:57:37,026 --> 00:57:40,195
沃尔夫，他在说什么？
Wolf, what's he talking about?

1132
00:57:42,464 --> 00:57:43,999
哎呀
Whoops.

1133
00:57:44,133 --> 00:57:46,869
我说得太多了吗？
Did I say too much?

1134
00:57:47,002 --> 00:57:49,338
不管怎样，看起来又一次
Anyhoo, looks like, yet again,

1135
00:57:49,471 --> 00:57:53,108
大灰狼被一只小猪打败了
the Big Bad Wolf got outsmarted by a little piggy.

1136
00:57:53,242 --> 00:57:56,078
你这个小脸蛋！
You little pouchy-cheeked rat!

1137
00:57:56,211 --> 00:57:57,613
我要杀了你！听到了吗？
I'll kill you! You hear me?

1138
00:57:57,747 --> 00:57:59,882
-你死定了！你是-帮助帮助帮助
-You're dead! You're de... -Help! Help! Help!

1139
00:58:00,015 --> 00:58:01,651
大灰狼正在攻击我
The Big Bad Wolf is attacking me.

1140
00:58:01,784 --> 00:58:04,319
哦，现在你永远完了，狼！
Oh, now you are done forever, Wolf!

1141
00:58:13,563 --> 00:58:15,397
教授，教授
Professor, Professor,

1142
00:58:15,531 --> 00:58:17,466
有没有想过坏人是怎么对付的
any thoughts on how the Bad Guys managed

1143
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,002
在肉眼可见的地方偷走陨石？
to steal the meteorite in plain sight?

1144
00:58:20,135 --> 00:58:21,370
好吧，在我脑子里
Well, off the top of my head,

1145
00:58:21,503 --> 00:58:23,238
也许他们以前访问过这个网站
perhaps they accessed the site previously

1146
00:58:23,372 --> 00:58:24,640
建立了一个复杂的系统
and set up an intricate system

1147
00:58:24,774 --> 00:58:26,308
-隧道和活板门-嗯
-of tunnels and trapdoors... -Uh-huh.

1148
00:58:26,441 --> 00:58:27,777
这可能是远程触发的
that could be remotely triggered

1149
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:29,378
把陨石吸到等待区，
to suck the meteorite down into a holding area,

1150
00:58:29,511 --> 00:58:31,080
-但我怎么知道呢-完全正确
-but how should I know? -Totally.

1151
00:58:31,213 --> 00:58:33,949
我是说，他们是精神错乱的主谋，不是我。
I mean, they're the deranged masterminds, not me.

1152
00:58:56,171 --> 00:58:58,641
我要把一切都还给你
I'm giving it all back.

1153
00:59:22,497 --> 00:59:24,233
真不敢相信我们被双重欺骗了
I can't believe we got double-crossed

1154
00:59:24,366 --> 00:59:25,668
一只小啮齿动物
by a tiny rodent.

1155
00:59:25,801 --> 00:59:28,137
我们被一只啮齿类动物出卖了好吧
Oh, we got double-crossed by a rodent all right,

1156
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:30,973
-但是，嗯，一点也不小-什么
-but, uh, not a tiny one. -What?

1157
00:59:31,106 --> 00:59:33,609
这应该是我们在骗橘子酱
This was supposed to be us conning Marmalade.

1158
00:59:33,743 --> 00:59:36,912
原来是狼在骗我们
It turns out it was Wolf conning us.

1159
00:59:38,714 --> 00:59:40,582
你听上去熟悉吗，沃尔夫？
Does that sound familiar to you, Wolf?

1160
00:59:40,716 --> 00:59:42,384
你为什么这么想？
Why-why would you think that?

1161
00:59:42,517 --> 00:59:45,120
我不知道，也许是因为你破坏了
Oh, I don't know, maybe because you just sabotaged

1162
00:59:45,254 --> 00:59:47,356
这是我们一生中最大的抢劫
the biggest heist of our lives.

1163
00:59:47,489 --> 00:59:50,592
我想你应该向我们解释一下，伙计。
I think you owe us an explanation, buddy.

1164
00:59:52,161 --> 00:59:53,262
可以你说得对。
Okay. You're right.

1165
00:59:53,395 --> 00:59:54,930
事情就是这样
This is what happened.

1166
00:59:55,064 --> 00:59:57,599
回到博物馆，我刚想偷一位老太太的钱包
Back in the museum, I just tried to steal an old lady's purse.

1167
00:59:57,733 --> 00:59:59,568
经典抓取和抓取
Classic snatch and grab.

1168
00:59:59,702 --> 01:00:01,904
试过了吗？你什么时候开始尝试的
Tried to? Since when do you try

1169
01:00:02,037 --> 01:00:03,906
去偷东西而不仅仅是偷？
to steal something and not just steal it?

1170
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:07,276
我正想偷钱包，这时老太太摔倒了。。。
I was trying to steal the purse when the old lady fell and...

1171
01:00:07,409 --> 01:00:09,378
我帮了她一点忙
I kind of helped her.

1172
01:00:09,511 --> 01:00:10,412
什么
What? 

1173
01:00:10,545 --> 01:00:12,514
我帮了她一把
I kind of helped her.

1174
01:00:12,648 --> 01:00:14,516
但后来你偷了她的钱
But then you stole her purse. 

1175
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:15,951
不，我没有
No, I didn't.

1176
01:00:16,085 --> 01:00:18,453
我救了老太太她拥抱了我
I saved the old lady, and she hugged me,

1177
01:00:18,587 --> 01:00:21,090
我摇着尾巴，不知道那是什么
and my tail wagged, and I didn't know what it was,

1178
01:00:21,223 --> 01:00:24,593
但感觉，呃，你知道。。。好的
but it felt, uh, you know... good.

1179
01:00:26,328 --> 01:00:27,362
啊。
Ah.

1180
01:00:27,496 --> 01:00:29,298
但后来你偷了钱包
But then you stole the purse.

1181
01:00:29,431 --> 01:00:30,866
其他人：不！
OTHERS: No!

1182
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,235
我听到猪对你说的话了
You know, I heard what the pig said to you

1183
01:00:33,368 --> 01:00:34,937
让我们放松
about cutting us loose.

1184
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:36,739
等待比如“我们”我们？
Wait. Like, "us" us?

1185
01:00:36,872 --> 01:00:38,841
但我从没想过你真的会这么做
But I never thought you'd actually do it, man.

1186
01:00:38,974 --> 01:00:40,409
嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1187
01:00:40,542 --> 01:00:42,945
我永远不会。。。我想。。。
I-I would never... I was trying to...

1188
01:00:43,078 --> 01:00:45,147
我想给我们找到更好的生活
I was trying to find us a better life.

1189
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,751
我们的生活是完美的，直到你决定毁掉它
Our life was perfect until you decided to ruin it.

1190
01:00:48,884 --> 01:00:50,085
我没有
I didn't.

1191
01:00:50,219 --> 01:00:51,653
你们在晚会上感觉到了
You guys felt it at the gala.

1192
01:00:53,756 --> 01:00:56,025
我们不仅仅是。。。而不仅仅是可怕的恶棍
We were more than... than just scary villains.

1193
01:00:56,158 --> 01:00:57,259
他们爱我们
They loved us.

1194
01:00:57,392 --> 01:00:59,829
哦，是吗？如果他们这么爱我们
Oh, yeah? If they loved us so much,

1195
01:00:59,962 --> 01:01:03,565
我们怎么会因为没犯的罪而坐牢？
how come we're in prison for a crime we didn't commit?

1196
01:01:03,699 --> 01:01:05,835
你知道吗？我给你这个橘子酱
You know what? I'll give Marmalade this.

1197
01:01:05,968 --> 01:01:08,003
至少他看到了世界的本来面目
At least he sees the world for what it is

1198
01:01:08,137 --> 01:01:10,272
有些人害怕的地方
a place where some people are scary

1199
01:01:10,405 --> 01:01:12,307
有些人很害怕
and some people are scared.

1200
01:01:12,441 --> 01:01:13,675
哦，是吗？
Oh, yeah?

1201
01:01:13,809 --> 01:01:15,377
我已经厌倦了害怕
Well, I'm tired of being scary.

1202
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:17,079
我厌倦了做一个被遗弃的人
I'm-I'm tired of being an outcast.

1203
01:01:17,212 --> 01:01:18,814
也许我不想成为。。。
Maybe I don't want to be a...

1204
01:01:18,948 --> 01:01:20,282
什么坏人？
What? A Bad Guy?

1205
01:01:20,415 --> 01:01:22,451
不想再做坏人了吧？
Don't want to be a Bad Guy anymore, huh?

1206
01:01:22,584 --> 01:01:24,686
说吧，狼。
Say it, Wolf.

1207
01:01:26,756 --> 01:01:28,223
是的，我想是的
Yeah, I thought so.

1208
01:01:28,357 --> 01:01:30,359
还有我们，你一生的朋友？
And us, your lifelong friends?

1209
01:01:30,492 --> 01:01:31,961
我们只是在阻止你？
We're just holding you back?

1210
01:01:32,094 --> 01:01:33,896
是的，也许你是！
Yeah, maybe you are!

1211
01:01:36,265 --> 01:01:37,867
拿回去
Take it back!

1212
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,469
拿回去！道歉
Take it back! Apologize!

1213
01:01:40,602 --> 01:01:42,337
嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿！
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1214
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:43,973
监狱不是打架的地方
Prison is no place for fighting.

1215
01:01:45,574 --> 01:01:47,376
告诉他
Tell that to him.

1216
01:01:47,509 --> 01:01:48,844
嗯？
Huh?

1217
01:01:52,982 --> 01:01:55,550
什么
What? 

1218
01:02:12,234 --> 01:02:13,803
嘘
Shh. 

1219
01:02:29,751 --> 01:02:31,954
快跑！
Run!

1220
01:02:38,393 --> 01:02:39,962
-哦-等等，等等。等等
-Oh! -W-W-Wait, wait. Ho-Hold on.

1221
01:02:42,364 --> 01:02:43,298
黛安？
Diane?

1222
01:02:43,432 --> 01:02:44,566
但是你怎么知道该怎么做呢
But how do you know how to do

1223
01:02:44,699 --> 01:02:45,868
所有的踢踏拳？
all of that kick-kick-punch-punch?

1224
01:02:46,001 --> 01:02:48,237
等等，你是那个深红色的爪子？
Wait a sec, you're the Crimson Paw?

1225
01:02:50,772 --> 01:02:52,241
囚徒女王
The queen of cons,

1226
01:02:52,374 --> 01:02:53,642
特技瑞士军刀
acrobatic Swiss Army knife.

1227
01:02:53,775 --> 01:02:55,110
两次偷了尊邦戈钻石
Stole the Zumpango diamond twice.

1228
01:02:55,244 --> 01:02:57,612
一次是为了赚钱，第二次只是为了好玩
Once for profit, second time just for fun.

1229
01:02:57,746 --> 01:03:00,149
从未被识别，从未被发现
Never identified, never caught.

1230
01:03:00,282 --> 01:03:03,118
我想我仍然是最好的坏人
Guess I'm still the best bad guy

1231
01:03:03,252 --> 01:03:05,120
全世界都见过
the world has ever seen.

1232
01:03:05,254 --> 01:03:07,689
至少我以前是
Ugh, at least I used to be. 

1233
01:03:07,823 --> 01:03:09,158
嗯？
Huh?

1234
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,202
不，我还是最好的
Nope, I'm still the best.

1235
01:03:20,335 --> 01:03:22,737
就像骑偷来的自行车
Just like riding a stolen bicycle.

1236
01:03:22,872 --> 01:03:25,407
你有点。。。哎哟
Oh, uh, you got a little... Ouch.

1237
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,609
你为什么要救我们？
Hey, wh-why did you save us anyway?

1238
01:03:27,742 --> 01:03:29,845
晚会结束后我知道有些不对劲
After the gala, I knew something wasn't right,

1239
01:03:29,979 --> 01:03:31,981
所以我做了一些调查，那颗流星。。。
so I did some investigating, and that meteor...

1240
01:03:32,114 --> 01:03:35,384
我知道。某种宇宙超级天线的东西
I know. Some kind of cosmic mega-super-antennae thing.

1241
01:03:35,517 --> 01:03:38,220
正当如果通过一系列电离晶体传导
Right. If conducted through an array of ionized crystals,

1242
01:03:38,353 --> 01:03:40,222
它将产生一个巨大的心理动力场
it will generate a massive psychokinetic field

1243
01:03:40,355 --> 01:03:41,556
城市的大小
the size of a city.

1244
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:43,025
天哪。我打断你了吗？
Oh, my gosh. Did I interrupt you?

1245
01:03:43,158 --> 01:03:44,259
你要这么说吗？
Were you gonna say that?

1246
01:03:44,393 --> 01:03:46,962
呃，我，我，我本想更专业一点
Uh, I-I-I was gonna be a little more technical,

1247
01:03:47,096 --> 01:03:49,999
但你知道要点了
but you got the gist of it. 

1248
01:03:51,066 --> 01:03:54,203
果酱需要停止，但我一个人做不到
Marmalade needs to be stopped, but I can't do it alone.

1249
01:03:54,336 --> 01:03:56,438
你比任何人都了解他的化合物
You know his compound better than anyone.

1250
01:03:56,571 --> 01:03:58,207
你可以相信我们
You can count on us.

1251
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:59,508
对吧，伙计们？
Right, guys?

1252
01:03:59,641 --> 01:04:01,543
没有“我们”
There is no "us."

1253
01:04:01,676 --> 01:04:03,212
我们完了，狼
We're through, Wolf.

1254
01:04:03,345 --> 01:04:04,746
完成。菲尼托
Done. Finito.

1255
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,216
就因为那场小小的争吵？
Because of that little tiff back there?

1256
01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:09,551
拜托，伙计，我们就是这么做的
Come on, man, that's what we do.

1257
01:04:09,684 --> 01:04:11,253
你发球，我截击
You serve, I volley.

1258
01:04:11,386 --> 01:04:13,355
那是我们的小舞会
That's our little dance.

1259
01:04:13,488 --> 01:04:15,557
这次不行
Not this time.

1260
01:04:20,329 --> 01:04:21,730
食人鱼？
Piranha?

1261
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,301
网？
Webs?

1262
01:04:26,435 --> 01:04:28,037
抱歉Wolfie。
Sorry, Wolfie.

1263
01:04:29,804 --> 01:04:31,106
鲨鱼
Shark.

1264
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,607
嗯
Hmm.

1265
01:04:32,741 --> 01:04:34,409
嘿
Hey.

1266
01:04:34,543 --> 01:04:36,111
伙计们？
Guys?

1267
01:04:37,079 --> 01:04:38,380
伙计们？
Guys?

1268
01:04:39,181 --> 01:04:42,717
你想知道我为什么讨厌生日吗，沃尔夫？你…吗？
You want to know why I hate birthdays, Wolf? Do you?

1269
01:04:44,053 --> 01:04:47,822
当你长成一条蛇的时候，没有人来参加你的聚会
When you grow up a snake, nobody shows up to your party.

1270
01:04:47,957 --> 01:04:50,926
生日时刻提醒着我们
Birthdays are a constant reminder that out there

1271
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:56,065
我只是一个可怕的，一无是处的怪物
I'm just a scary, good-for-nothing monster.

1272
01:04:57,499 --> 01:04:59,168
是 啊
Yeah.

1273
01:04:59,301 --> 01:05:02,104
但没有什么能比得上只有一个人。。。
But nothing compares to having the one guy...

1274
01:05:02,237 --> 01:05:05,507
那个我以为可以信任的人
the one guy I thought I could trust

1275
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,742
从背后捅我一刀
stab me in the back.

1276
01:05:11,246 --> 01:05:13,915
来吧，伙计们。我们从这里出去吧。
Come on, guys. Let's get out of here.

1277
01:06:00,996 --> 01:06:05,034
这才是真正的坏蛋
Now, this is what a true bad guy looks like.

1278
01:06:11,073 --> 01:06:13,908
我们玩得开心点怎么样？
What do you say we have some fun?

1279
01:06:52,814 --> 01:06:55,550
嘿你没事吧？
Hey. You okay?

1280
01:06:55,684 --> 01:06:57,319
不，我不好
No, I'm not okay.

1281
01:06:57,452 --> 01:07:00,155
我非常非常不好
I'm very, very un-okay.

1282
01:07:01,456 --> 01:07:03,325
刚刚离开我唯一的朋友
Just left the only friends I have ever had,

1283
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:06,795
那我是什么...我在做什么？
so what am I... what am I doing?

1284
01:07:09,598 --> 01:07:12,401
我知道这不容易
I know this isn't easy,

1285
01:07:12,534 --> 01:07:14,669
把一切抛在脑后
leaving everything behind.

1286
01:07:14,803 --> 01:07:16,138
-是吗-是 啊
-Do you? -Yeah.

1287
01:07:16,271 --> 01:07:18,607
我是世界上最好的小偷
I was the best thief in the world.

1288
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:22,611
快速、无畏、有创造力
Fast, fearless, inventive.

1289
01:07:22,744 --> 01:07:25,580
我只剩下一件东西要偷了
I just had one thing left to steal.

1290
01:07:25,714 --> 01:07:27,349
金色海豚
The Golden Dolphin.

1291
01:07:27,482 --> 01:07:29,351
所以你去追了
So you went after it.

1292
01:07:29,484 --> 01:07:31,353
我不只是去追求它
I didn't just go after it.

1293
01:07:32,521 --> 01:07:34,423
我做到了
I had it.

1294
01:07:34,556 --> 01:07:36,791
还有一条清晰的逃生路线
And a clear escape route.

1295
01:07:39,361 --> 01:07:41,330
但是
But...

1296
01:07:41,463 --> 01:07:43,965
最后我只看到了那只狡猾的狐狸
all I saw in the end was the tricky fox

1297
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:46,868
他们总是告诉我我是
that they always told me I was.

1298
01:07:47,902 --> 01:07:50,105
它改变了一切
It changed everything.

1299
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:52,707
所以现在，与其伤害别人
So, now, instead of hurting people,

1300
01:07:52,841 --> 01:07:54,409
我在帮助他们
I'm helping them.

1301
01:07:54,543 --> 01:07:56,111
我还是我自己
I'm still me. 

1302
01:07:56,245 --> 01:07:59,348
我只是站在右边的我
I'm just me on the right side.

1303
01:08:00,815 --> 01:08:02,284
你做得对
You're doing the right thing.

1304
01:08:02,417 --> 01:08:05,887
有一天你的朋友如果他们是真正的朋友
And someday your friends, if they're real friends,

1305
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:08,223
我想他们会理解的
I think they'll understand.

1306
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:11,160
现在，来吧，我们进去吧
Now, come on, let's get inside.

1307
01:08:11,293 --> 01:08:14,129
你看起来像刚从监狱里逃出来
You look like you just busted out of a prison. 

1308
01:08:17,666 --> 01:08:19,000
豚鼠？
Guinea pigs? 

1309
01:08:19,134 --> 01:08:20,469
迈拉迪
Marmalade.

1310
01:08:20,602 --> 01:08:21,603
让我们跳起来
Let's bounce.

1311
01:08:23,505 --> 01:08:26,141
这就是大红爪子的藏身之处
So this is the hideout of the great Crimson Paw.

1312
01:08:27,676 --> 01:08:28,810
小吃休息？
Snack break?

1313
01:08:28,943 --> 01:08:30,679
好吧，时间很奇怪，但你知道
Okay, oddly timed, but you do you.

1314
01:08:32,013 --> 01:08:33,047
自动语音：身份验证
AUTOMATED VOICE: Identity verified.

1315
01:08:33,182 --> 01:08:35,417
-什么-欢迎，黛安
-What? -Welcome, Diane.

1316
01:08:41,156 --> 01:08:44,226
-哇！天哪
-Whoa! Holy moly!

1317
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:46,661
回家真是太好了
It's so good to be home.

1318
01:08:46,795 --> 01:08:47,896
你在开玩笑吧？
Are you kidding me?

1319
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:49,664
激光瞄准拉链？
Laser-sighted zip line?

1320
01:08:49,798 --> 01:08:52,367
XM-2400雷达干扰机？不可能
The XM-2400 radar jammer? No way.

1321
01:08:52,501 --> 01:08:54,636
实际上我更喜欢早期的型号
I actually prefer the earlier model.

1322
01:08:54,769 --> 01:08:56,538
同意不同意
Agree to disagree.

1323
01:08:56,671 --> 01:08:58,273
这东西也不错
Uh, this stuff is nice, too.

1324
01:08:59,574 --> 01:09:00,909
是的，那是喷灯
Yeah, that's a blowtorch.

1325
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:03,044
而且，不是你的颜色
Also, not really your color.

1326
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:06,147
好的，迈拉迪
All righty, Marmalade.

1327
01:09:06,281 --> 01:09:09,818
你在干什么，你这个毛茸茸的小怪人？
What are you up to, you fuzzy little weirdo?

1328
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:11,486
我们需要关注这座城市
We need eyes on the city.

1329
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:12,954
让我们看看是否能破解
Let's see if we can't hack

1330
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,356
进入政府的监控卫星
into the government's surveillance satellite.

1331
01:09:14,489 --> 01:09:16,225
但你是州长。你就不能问问吗？
But you're the governor. Couldn't you just ask?

1332
01:09:16,358 --> 01:09:18,527
是的，但是。。。文书工作
Yeah, but... the paperwork.

1333
01:09:23,398 --> 01:09:27,168
我肯定在这里发现了可疑的活动
I am definitely picking up on suspicious activity here.

1334
01:09:27,302 --> 01:09:29,471
这些是豚鼠的热信号
Those are guinea pig heat signatures.

1335
01:09:29,604 --> 01:09:31,873
果酱似乎在控制它们
Marmalade seems to be controlling them.

1336
01:09:32,006 --> 01:09:34,008
但是做什么呢？
But to do what?

1337
01:09:34,142 --> 01:09:35,577
没有明显的目标
There are no obvious targets.

1338
01:09:37,579 --> 01:09:39,981
那是因为他们在移动目标
That's because they're moving targets.

1339
01:09:40,114 --> 01:09:43,084
他的慈善筹款
His charity fundraiser.

1340
01:09:43,218 --> 01:09:45,487
他要偷他自己名下的钱？
He's gonna steal the money raised in his own name?

1341
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:48,156
这是世界上有史以来最大的抢劫案
It's the greatest heist the world's ever seen.

1342
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:50,325
卡车里有十亿美元
$1 billion inside trucks,

1343
01:09:50,459 --> 01:09:52,461
在去全市慈善机构的路上
on their way to charities all over the city.

1344
01:09:52,594 --> 01:09:53,995
我们需要切断果酱的联系
We need to cut off Marmalade's communication

1345
01:09:54,128 --> 01:09:55,163
和他的豚鼠军队在一起
with his guinea pig army.

1346
01:09:55,297 --> 01:09:56,831
如果没有信号。。。
If there's no signal...

1347
01:09:56,965 --> 01:09:58,166
没有抢劫
There's no heist.

1348
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:00,402
我们必须偷陨石
We have to steal the meteorite.

1349
01:10:00,535 --> 01:10:01,636
很可爱
That was very cute,

1350
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:03,204
-我们刚才在那里做的事-好吧
-that thing we just did there. -All right.

1351
01:10:03,338 --> 01:10:05,707
穿上你的大女孩裤子。我们正在准备
Put on your big-girl pants. We're gearing up.

1352
01:10:11,713 --> 01:10:13,014
我不会接受的
I wouldn't take that.

1353
01:10:13,147 --> 01:10:14,683
那些东西会把你的裤子扯下来
Those things rip your pants right off.

1354
01:10:14,816 --> 01:10:16,518
呵呵。试着穿干净的内衣
Huh. Try wearing clean underwear.

1355
01:10:16,651 --> 01:10:18,453
以防万一
Just in case.

1356
01:10:19,421 --> 01:10:20,555
什么。。。
Wha...

1357
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:24,158
你偷了我的车？
You stole my car?

1358
01:10:24,293 --> 01:10:25,560
尊重点
Respect.

1359
01:10:25,694 --> 01:10:28,330
我们开始吧
Let's do this. 

1360
01:10:39,774 --> 01:10:40,775
-不-什么
-No! -What?

1361
01:10:40,909 --> 01:10:42,277
我们所有的东西？
All our stuff?

1362
01:10:43,077 --> 01:10:44,579
-一切都在哪里-不，不，不，不，不。
-Where is everything? -No, no, no, no, no.

1363
01:10:44,713 --> 01:10:46,381
-不，不，不，不，不，不，不，不-我们所有的东西。
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! -All our stuff.

1364
01:10:46,515 --> 01:10:48,283
-都没了-我的伪装柜！
-It's all gone. -My disguise closet!

1365
01:10:48,417 --> 01:10:50,652
我的东西呢
Where's my things? 

1366
01:10:51,753 --> 01:10:54,022
狼把我们所有的战利品都给了我们。
Wolf gave away all our loot.

1367
01:10:54,155 --> 01:10:56,458
我们把它偷走了。
We stole it fair and square.

1368
01:10:56,591 --> 01:10:58,593
现在我明白这是什么感觉了
Now I understand what it feels like

1369
01:10:58,727 --> 01:11:01,363
把你的东西偷走
to have things stolen from you. 

1370
01:11:01,496 --> 01:11:03,197
我不喜欢！
I don't like it!

1371
01:11:03,332 --> 01:11:06,034
我真的不喜欢！
I really don't like it! 

1372
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:14,042
我们没有食物。我们没有钱
We got no food. We got no money.

1373
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:15,577
我们没有钱可以用来买食物
We got no money we could use to buy food.

1374
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:17,679
我们卖不到能赚钱的食物
No food we can sell for money. 

1375
01:11:17,812 --> 01:11:19,881
我们...
We... 

1376
01:11:20,014 --> 01:11:22,083
好吧，好吧，好吧
All right, okay, okay.

1377
01:11:22,216 --> 01:11:24,486
这里，这里。拿去吧
Here, here. Take it.

1378
01:11:24,619 --> 01:11:26,655
别哭了，伙计。
Now, stop crying, buddy.

1379
01:11:29,358 --> 01:11:33,995
斯内克，你刚才做了什么？
Um, Snake, what did you just do?

1380
01:11:34,128 --> 01:11:35,797
什么我的朋友很伤心
What? My friend was sad.

1381
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:37,366
我只是在给他加油。
I was just cheering him up.

1382
01:11:37,499 --> 01:11:39,868
你你做了一件好事
You... you did a good thing.

1383
01:11:40,001 --> 01:11:41,870
-对我来说-别傻了
-For me. -Don't be ridiculous.

1384
01:11:42,003 --> 01:11:44,205
我只是把你的需要放在我自己的需要之前
I just put your needs before my own.

1385
01:11:44,339 --> 01:11:46,708
-对。你表现得很好-我不是
-Yeah. You're being good. -I'm not.

1386
01:11:46,841 --> 01:11:49,744
我只是为了让鲨鱼开心而做出牺牲。
I was simply making a sacrifice so Shark could be happy.

1387
01:11:49,878 --> 01:11:52,881
这就是“好”的实际定义
That is the actual definition of being good.

1388
01:11:53,014 --> 01:11:54,916
斯内克，你
Snake, you,

1389
01:11:55,049 --> 01:11:57,151
我们中最坏的一个，最自私的一个
the worst one of us, the most selfish.

1390
01:11:57,285 --> 01:11:58,753
-恶毒的-可怕的
-Spiteful. -Terrible.

1391
01:11:58,887 --> 01:11:59,988
-鬼鬼祟祟的-不诚实的
-Sneaky. -Dishonest.

1392
01:12:00,121 --> 01:12:01,155
-麻木不仁-善于操纵的
-Insensitive. -Manipulative.

1393
01:12:01,289 --> 01:12:02,657
-蛇形的-斯坦基
-Snakelike. -Stanky.

1394
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:04,693
你的意思是？
And your point is?

1395
01:12:04,826 --> 01:12:06,595
我认为沃尔夫是对的
I think Wolf was right.

1396
01:12:06,728 --> 01:12:09,731
也许我们不只是可怕的恶棍
Maybe we could be more than just scary villains.

1397
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:14,202
什么。。。？
Wh...?

1398
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,037
哦，哇
Oh, wow.

1399
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:18,673
这是。。。这是摇摆吗？
Is this... is this wagging?

1400
01:12:19,674 --> 01:12:21,342
我们在摇摆
We're-we're wagging.

1401
01:12:23,144 --> 01:12:25,847
不，不，不！
No, no, no!

1402
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:30,084
我们永远都是坏人！
We'll always be Bad Guys!

1403
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:58,447
快点，快点，我的小猪
Faster, faster, my little pigs.

1404
01:13:42,256 --> 01:13:44,025
一旦我们偷了陨石
Once we steal the meteorite,

1405
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:45,894
我们直接报警
we take it straight to the police.

1406
01:13:46,027 --> 01:13:47,629
一切都会被原谅
And all will be forgiven.

1407
01:13:47,762 --> 01:13:51,199
我不知道“全部”，但这只是个开始
I don't know about "all," but it's a start.

1408
01:14:10,451 --> 01:14:11,920
真奇怪
That's strange.

1409
01:14:12,053 --> 01:14:15,156
为什么迈拉迪会让金海豚不受保护？
Why would Marmalade leave the Golden Dolphin unprotected?

1410
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:18,159
-因为这可能是个陷阱-或者也许。。。
-Because maybe it's a trap. -Or maybe...

1411
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:20,428
-等等，等等，等等
-Wait, wait, wait! 

1412
01:14:21,195 --> 01:14:22,330
是的，那是个陷阱
Yeah, it was a trap.

1413
01:14:22,463 --> 01:14:23,898
好吧，好吧，好吧
Well, well, well.

1414
01:14:24,032 --> 01:14:26,501
如果不是我的宝贝学生
If it isn't my prized pupil.

1415
01:14:26,635 --> 01:14:28,703
你还带来了州长
And you've brought along the governor.

1416
01:14:28,837 --> 01:14:30,171
或者我应该说。。。
Or should I say...

1417
01:14:30,304 --> 01:14:31,773
-深红色的爪子
-the Crimson Paw? 

1418
01:14:31,906 --> 01:14:36,711
嗯，这是一个多么巧妙的伪装尊邦钻石的方法
Mm, what an ingenious way to disguise a Zumpango diamond,

1419
01:14:36,845 --> 01:14:39,047
把它藏在显眼的地方
hiding it in plain sight.

1420
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:41,149
你开玩笑吧
You got to be kidding me.

1421
01:14:41,282 --> 01:14:43,017
什么我多愁善感
What? I'm sentimental.

1422
01:14:43,151 --> 01:14:44,653
你总是很有气派
You always did have panache.

1423
01:14:44,786 --> 01:14:47,689
然而，你还是掉进了我的陷阱
And yet, you still fell right into my trap.

1424
01:14:47,822 --> 01:14:50,058
但你怎么知道我们会在这里？
But how did you know we'd even be here?

1425
01:14:50,191 --> 01:14:53,227
哦，我从一个朋友那里得到了一点提示
Oh, I got a little tip from a friend.

1426
01:14:54,863 --> 01:14:56,164
嘿，伙计
Hey, buddy.

1427
01:14:56,297 --> 01:14:57,599
挂起来怎么样？
How's it hanging?

1428
01:14:57,732 --> 01:15:00,234
蛇
Snake. 

1429
01:15:00,368 --> 01:15:02,103
我能说什么？我们只是点击了一下
What can I say? We just clicked.

1430
01:15:02,236 --> 01:15:05,907
哦，是吗？为你最喜欢的食物工作感觉如何？
Oh, yeah? How's it feel to be working for your favorite food?

1431
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,942
啊，你只是嫉妒
Ah, you're just jealous

1432
01:15:08,076 --> 01:15:10,344
错过了本世纪的抢劫案
to be missing out on the heist of the century.

1433
01:15:10,478 --> 01:15:12,146
它拥有一切
It's got everything

1434
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:15,183
背叛，流星，精神控制。
betrayal, a meteor, mind control.

1435
01:15:15,316 --> 01:15:16,718
我能试穿一下吗？
Can I try it on?

1436
01:15:16,851 --> 01:15:18,519
当然，搭档
Of course, partner.

1437
01:15:18,653 --> 01:15:22,591
美好的所有的罪行都没有经过训练
Nice. All the crime with none of the exercise.

1438
01:15:24,025 --> 01:15:25,827
那么那些“善良之花”的说法呢？
What about all that "flower of goodness" talk?

1439
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,128
这都是谎言吗？
Was it all just a lie?

1440
01:15:27,261 --> 01:15:28,930
差不多，是的
Uh, pretty much, yeah.

1441
01:15:29,063 --> 01:15:31,265
你看，我从来不在乎什么是“好的”
You see, I never cared about what's "good."

1442
01:15:31,399 --> 01:15:33,367
只有对我有好处的
Only what's good for me.

1443
01:15:33,501 --> 01:15:35,970
比如说，十亿美元
Like, say, a billion dollars.

1444
01:15:36,104 --> 01:15:38,873
哦，我只是有点刺痛
Ooh, I just got a tingle. 

1445
01:15:40,341 --> 01:15:41,843
变坏。。。
Go bad...

1446
01:15:41,976 --> 01:15:44,045
或者回家。
Or go home.

1447
01:15:44,178 --> 01:15:46,681
拥抱，完成它们
Cuddles, finish them.

1448
01:15:55,389 --> 01:15:56,858
毒气
Poison gas.

1449
01:15:56,991 --> 01:15:58,259
摒住呼吸
Don't breathe it in.

1450
01:15:58,392 --> 01:16:00,261
等一下
Wait a second.

1451
01:16:00,394 --> 01:16:02,130
那不是毒气
That's not poison gas.

1452
01:16:04,032 --> 01:16:04,933
对不起
Sorry! 

1453
01:16:06,234 --> 01:16:07,335
惊喜
Surprise! 

1454
01:16:07,468 --> 01:16:10,271
什么啊，伙计们
What? Ah, guys.

1455
01:16:10,404 --> 01:16:11,840
我不敢相信是你
I can't believe it's you.

1456
01:16:11,973 --> 01:16:14,408
-你说得对Wolfie-我们感觉到了摇摆，伙计
-You were right, Wolfie. -We felt the wag, man.

1457
01:16:14,542 --> 01:16:16,110
还有刺痛感-很好，对吧？
And the tingle. -It's good, right?

1458
01:16:16,244 --> 01:16:17,545
这太感人了
This is super moving,

1459
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:19,280
但我们可以晚一点再做吗？
but can we do this later?

1460
01:16:19,413 --> 01:16:21,716
感觉我的鳍上有节奏部分
Feels like I got a rhythm section in my fin.

1461
01:16:23,351 --> 01:16:25,219
-啊，啊-黛安：啊。来吧
-Ah, ah! -DIANE: Ugh. Come on.

1462
01:16:25,353 --> 01:16:26,254
旋转刀片！
Spinning blades!

1463
01:16:26,387 --> 01:16:27,622
哦，是的。正当
Oh, yeah. Right.

1464
01:16:27,756 --> 01:16:28,957
很抱歉我得到了它
Sorry. I got it.

1465
01:16:31,259 --> 01:16:32,794
伙计们...
Guys... 

1466
01:16:32,927 --> 01:16:35,429
很高兴见到你
Am I happy to see you.

1467
01:16:38,366 --> 01:16:39,734
现在是时候气喘吁吁了
Now it's time to huff and puff

1468
01:16:39,868 --> 01:16:41,836
把这只小猪的抢劫案打掉
and blow this little piggy's heist down.

1469
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:43,571
游戏结束了，豚鼠
Game over, guinea pig.

1470
01:16:43,705 --> 01:16:47,008
有了这块陨石，我们就能犯罪了
With this meteorite, we will be able to commit crimes

1471
01:16:47,141 --> 01:16:49,077
人们只会梦想
people have only dreamed about.

1472
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:51,145
对一块屁股石头来说还不错
Not bad for a butt rock.

1473
01:16:51,279 --> 01:16:54,115
再一次，这不是。。。
Once again, it's not a...

1474
01:16:54,248 --> 01:16:55,784
别介意我们
Don't mind us.

1475
01:16:55,917 --> 01:16:57,686
只是抢劫这个地方
Just robbing this place. 

1476
01:17:00,121 --> 01:17:01,589
不，不，不！
No, no, no!

1477
01:17:07,528 --> 01:17:09,130
来，凯蒂，凯蒂，凯蒂，凯蒂
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1478
01:17:26,247 --> 01:17:27,682
-好吧-我们做到了！
-All right! -We did it!

1479
01:17:27,816 --> 01:17:30,518
现在把这件事告诉局长，澄清你的名字
Now to get this thing to the chief and clear your names.

1480
01:17:30,651 --> 01:17:32,754
奇怪的通常，我们开车远离警察
Weird. Usually, we drive away from the police.

1481
01:17:32,887 --> 01:17:35,389
嘿，奇科，你确定我们阻止了抢劫吗？
Hey, chico, are you sure we stopped the heist?

1482
01:17:35,523 --> 01:17:37,125
-对-放松
-Yeah. -Relax.

1483
01:17:37,258 --> 01:17:39,527
如果没有陨石，迈拉迪就无法控制它们
Marmalade can't control them if he doesn't have the meteorite.

1484
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:41,896
那么，谁在开那些卡车？
So, who's driving those trucks?

1485
01:17:45,299 --> 01:17:47,168
陨石
The meteorite.

1486
01:17:47,301 --> 01:17:48,602
-它还在传播-哦
-It's still transmitting. -Uh-oh.

1487
01:17:48,737 --> 01:17:50,972
慈善基金。改变计划，伙计们
The charity money. Change of plan, guys.

1488
01:17:51,105 --> 01:17:52,606
有什么方法可以覆盖吗
Webs, is there some way to override

1489
01:17:52,741 --> 01:17:54,042
卡车的导航系统？
the truck's navigation system?

1490
01:17:54,175 --> 01:17:55,343
我们需要一些
Uh, we'd need some kind of

1491
01:17:55,476 --> 01:17:57,245
磁化交叉电路拦截器
magnetized cross-circuit interceptor.

1492
01:17:57,378 --> 01:17:59,347
你是说这个？
You mean this?

1493
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:01,716
哦！她只是越来越酷！
Ooh! She just keeps getting cooler!

1494
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:02,917
哦，是的！
Oh, yeah!

1495
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:14,996
哇，哇，哇，哇，哇！
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1496
01:18:18,566 --> 01:18:20,101
哦，不
Oh, no.

1497
01:18:21,235 --> 01:18:22,370
我们得分手了
We got to split up.

1498
01:18:22,503 --> 01:18:24,238
韦伯斯，你想去女孩之旅吗？
Webs, you feel like a girls' trip?

1499
01:18:24,372 --> 01:18:25,974
嗯，是的
Um, yes.

1500
01:18:26,107 --> 01:18:28,977
稍后，孩子们
Later, boys. 

1501
01:18:34,315 --> 01:18:36,684
我想去参加女孩们的旅行
I want to go on the girls' trip.

1502
01:18:47,461 --> 01:18:48,696
呜呜！
Woo-hoo!

1503
01:18:53,768 --> 01:18:55,303
-你有保险，对吗-是 啊为什么？
-You're insured, right? -Yeah. Why?

1504
01:18:56,670 --> 01:18:59,307
嘿那是我的车！
Hey! That's my car!

1505
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:02,210
是切维奇，宝贝
It's ceviche, baby! 

1506
01:19:28,502 --> 01:19:30,972
再见，笨蛋
So long, suckers.

1507
01:19:48,022 --> 01:19:49,723
你从哪里学来的？
Where'd you learn to do that?

1508
01:19:49,858 --> 01:19:52,293
我是天生的
Well, I'm, you know, kind of a natural.

1509
01:19:52,426 --> 01:19:54,062
主要是YouTube
Mostly YouTube.

1510
01:19:55,029 --> 01:19:55,897
干得好
Nice work.

1511
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:57,465
在警察局等我
Meet me at the police station.

1512
01:19:57,598 --> 01:19:59,600
不要迟到
 Don't be late.

1513
01:20:00,568 --> 01:20:03,437
我们把这块石头交给局长怎么样？
What do you say we deliver this butt rock to the chief?

1514
01:20:03,571 --> 01:20:05,339
对
Yeah. 

1515
01:20:11,245 --> 01:20:12,413
哦
Oh. 

1516
01:20:12,546 --> 01:20:14,348
不，不，不，不！
No, no, no, no!

1517
01:20:14,482 --> 01:20:16,284
那是我偷来的钱
That's my stolen money.

1518
01:20:16,417 --> 01:20:18,119
如果你连这个都做不到，那又有什么用呢
What good are you if you can't even

1519
01:20:18,252 --> 01:20:19,487
预测他们的下一步行动？
anticipate their next move?

1520
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:21,289
-哦，那是我的错-对
-Oh, so it's my fault? -Yes.

1521
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,496
-头儿-这最好是好的
-Chief. -This better be good.

1522
01:20:28,629 --> 01:20:30,999
相信我，你不会想错过的
Trust me, you don't want to miss this.

1523
01:20:31,132 --> 01:20:32,300
看
Look.

1524
01:20:33,734 --> 01:20:35,603
给我的小面包涂黄油
Well, butter my crumpets.

1525
01:20:35,736 --> 01:20:36,971
会吗？
Can it be?

1526
01:20:37,105 --> 01:20:39,340
坏人要归还陨石？
The Bad Guys are returning the meteorite?

1527
01:20:39,473 --> 01:20:42,676
也许这是我们都需要的感觉良好的故事
Perhaps this is the feel-good story we all need.

1528
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:44,145
-是啊 -好吧
-Woo-hoo! Yeah! -Woo-hoo! -All right!

1529
01:20:44,278 --> 01:20:46,047
你们觉得他们会给我们开派对吗？
Do you guys think they'll throw us a party?

1530
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:49,717
是 啊有烟火、馅饼和蛋糕
Yeah. With fireworks, pi?atas and cake.

1531
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:08,202
没有他我们做不到
We can't do this without him.

1532
01:21:09,003 --> 01:21:10,871
他可能是个脾气暴躁的先生。。。
He might be a Mr. Grumpy Pants...

1533
01:21:11,005 --> 01:21:13,507
但他是我们的暴躁先生
But he's our Mr. Grumpy Pants.

1534
01:21:13,641 --> 01:21:16,244
对
Yeah. 

1535
01:21:17,578 --> 01:21:18,947
狼
Wolf!

1536
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,983
我开始明白为什么你的朋友甩了你
I'm starting to see why your friends dumped you.

1537
01:21:22,116 --> 01:21:24,285
我没有朋友
I don't have any friends! 

1538
01:21:24,418 --> 01:21:26,988
蛇！蛇
Snake! Snake!

1539
01:21:27,121 --> 01:21:28,389
狼
Wolf?

1540
01:21:28,522 --> 01:21:29,757
蛇，回来！
Snake, come back!

1541
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:31,392
我们需要你，宝贝！
We need you, baby!

1542
01:21:31,525 --> 01:21:32,961
你需要我们！
And you need us!

1543
01:21:33,094 --> 01:21:37,065
哦，你又来了，把它变成私人的
Oh, there you go again, making it personal.

1544
01:21:37,198 --> 01:21:40,001
我给你最后一次机会把陨石给我
I'll give you one last chance to give me the meteorite.

1545
01:21:40,134 --> 01:21:43,071
哦，是吗？你要怎么做，胡子？
Oh, yeah? What you gonna do, Whiskers?

1546
01:21:43,938 --> 01:21:45,406
这个
This. 

1547
01:21:46,674 --> 01:21:48,309
什么。。。？
What the...?

1548
01:21:54,448 --> 01:21:55,549
我们有可爱的同伴
We've got adorable company.

1549
01:21:55,683 --> 01:21:57,718
趴下！
Floor it!

1550
01:22:02,156 --> 01:22:03,691
哇！
Whoa!

1551
01:22:06,094 --> 01:22:08,329
也许我不该叫他胡子
Maybe I shouldn't have called him Whiskers.

1552
01:22:15,736 --> 01:22:17,005
今天早上我醒来的时候
When I woke up this morning,

1553
01:22:17,138 --> 01:22:19,473
这不是我今天看到的
this is not where I saw the day going.

1554
01:22:22,910 --> 01:22:24,112
来吧
Come on.

1555
01:22:25,246 --> 01:22:26,747
哇，哇，哇，哇
SNAKE: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1556
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,749
嘿，嘿，让我们把这个调低一点，好吗？
Hey, hey, let's dial this down a notch, huh?

1557
01:22:28,882 --> 01:22:30,551
再说，你永远也抓不到他
Besides, you'll never get him.

1558
01:22:30,684 --> 01:22:32,586
他是个很好的司机
He's too good a driver.

1559
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,188
嗯，你说得对。
Hmm. You're right.

1560
01:22:34,322 --> 01:22:36,757
但现在我想起来了，也许会更好
But now that I think of it, maybe it would be better

1561
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:38,526
利用他最大的弱点
to exploit his greatest weakness.

1562
01:22:38,659 --> 01:22:40,461
确切地
Exactly.

1563
01:22:40,594 --> 01:22:42,930
等
Wait.

1564
01:22:45,933 --> 01:22:47,901
哇，哇，哇，哇，哇，哇，哇。等等
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

1565
01:22:48,036 --> 01:22:49,637
等等，等等，等等
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

1566
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:51,472
好的，好的。你赢了
Okay, okay. You win.

1567
01:22:51,605 --> 01:22:53,307
你可以拥有太空石
You can have the space rock.

1568
01:22:53,441 --> 01:22:54,808
好孩子，狼
Good boy, Wolf.

1569
01:23:04,985 --> 01:23:06,487
开车
Take the wheel.

1570
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:07,788
没那么快
Not so fast.

1571
01:23:07,921 --> 01:23:11,225
先把他拉上来，不然我就用这个
Pull him up first, or I'll use this.

1572
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:13,161
哦，来吧
Oh, come now.

1573
01:23:17,231 --> 01:23:19,933
去做吧，否则你会失去那块石头的
Do it, or you'll lose the rock.

1574
01:23:20,968 --> 01:23:22,403
如果你坚持的话
If you insist.

1575
01:23:22,536 --> 01:23:23,904
拥抱！
Cuddles!

1576
01:23:30,844 --> 01:23:33,281
你想要他？他是你的
You want him? He's yours.

1577
01:23:37,485 --> 01:23:39,587
蛇不，不，不！
Snake! No, no, no!

1578
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:41,589
-蛇-哦，不！
-Snake! -Oh, no!

1579
01:23:54,835 --> 01:23:57,471
伙计们，我知道这很疯狂，但我们要跳下去
Guys, I know it's crazy, but we're gonna jump it.

1580
01:23:57,605 --> 01:24:00,474
疯子你终于能说我的语言了，奇科
Crazy? You're finally speaking my language, chico.

1581
01:24:10,784 --> 01:24:14,054
我们会成功的！
We're gonna make it!

1582
01:24:14,955 --> 01:24:16,224
不！
No!

1583
01:24:21,529 --> 01:24:23,231
你回来了
You came back.

1584
01:24:26,167 --> 01:24:27,235
蛇
Snake.

1585
01:24:27,368 --> 01:24:28,736
我应该对你说实话
I should've been honest with you.

1586
01:24:28,869 --> 01:24:30,070
我担心如果你知道
I was afraid that if you knew

1587
01:24:30,204 --> 01:24:31,839
我想表现得很好，你。。。
I-I wanted to be good that you'd...

1588
01:24:31,972 --> 01:24:34,875
表现得像个混蛋，再也不和你说话了？
Act like a jerk and never talk to you again?

1589
01:24:35,008 --> 01:24:36,677
是的
Yeah.

1590
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:38,779
重点是我。。。我，我，你知道。。。
Point is I... I-I-I, you know...

1591
01:24:38,912 --> 01:24:41,482
是 啊我也爱你，伙计
Yeah. I love you, too, buddy.

1592
01:24:45,719 --> 01:24:47,388
这太美了
This-this is so beautiful.

1593
01:24:47,521 --> 01:24:49,923
你们知道这有多美吗？
Do you know how beautiful this is, you guys?

1594
01:24:50,057 --> 01:24:51,159
现在...
Now...

1595
01:24:51,292 --> 01:24:52,993
现在你要让我哭了
Now you're gonna make me cry.

1596
01:24:53,127 --> 01:24:54,628
我知道！
I know!

1597
01:24:54,762 --> 01:24:56,230
真可怜，对吧？
So pathetic, right?

1598
01:24:56,364 --> 01:24:58,299
来吧，伙计们。
Come on, guys.

1599
01:24:58,432 --> 01:25:00,100
谁说结束了？
Who said it was the end?

1600
01:25:13,947 --> 01:25:15,916
不，不，不，不要。。。不，不，拥抱！
No, no, no, don't... No, no. Cuddles!

1601
01:25:16,049 --> 01:25:17,685
我们正在失去高度！
We're losing altitude!

1602
01:25:17,818 --> 01:25:20,020
我们正在失去高度！我们要下去了！
We're losing altitude! We're going down!

1603
01:25:26,327 --> 01:25:28,229
怎么搞的？我们爆炸了吗？
What happened? Did we blow up?

1604
01:25:28,362 --> 01:25:30,298
这是天堂吗？
Is this heaven?

1605
01:25:39,139 --> 01:25:41,008
就是这样
That is it.

1606
01:25:41,141 --> 01:25:42,643
嘿！
Hey!

1607
01:25:42,776 --> 01:25:45,813
这次你绝对逃不掉
There is absolutely no way you're getting away this time.

1608
01:25:45,946 --> 01:25:47,848
-等等，福辛顿州长？
-Wait, Chief. -Governor Foxington?

1609
01:25:47,981 --> 01:25:49,183
-不要这样做-噢！
-Don't do this. -Ow!

1610
01:25:49,317 --> 01:25:50,618
他们没有偷陨石
They didn't steal the meteorite.

1611
01:25:50,751 --> 01:25:51,919
他们要把它带回来
They were bringing it back.

1612
01:25:52,052 --> 01:25:54,054
哈你怎么知道的？
Ha! How could you know that?

1613
01:25:54,188 --> 01:25:57,090
除非除非你在密谋
Unless... unless you were conspiring

1614
01:25:57,225 --> 01:25:59,827
和一群已知的罪犯在一起
with a bunch of known criminals.

1615
01:26:00,761 --> 01:26:02,696
好...
Well... 

1616
01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:05,199
事实上，事实上
as a matter of fact,

1617
01:26:05,333 --> 01:26:07,568
该是我坦白的时候了
it's time I came clean about something.

1618
01:26:08,369 --> 01:26:11,672
事实是我真的...真的...
The truth is I'm really...r-really...

1619
01:26:11,805 --> 01:26:14,275
真的很喜欢救赎弧
Really a big fan of redemption arcs.

1620
01:26:14,408 --> 01:26:16,143
是的，我们知道
Yeah, we know.

1621
01:26:21,582 --> 01:26:22,816
我们跑完了
We're done running away.

1622
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:23,917
-对-嗯
-Yeah. -Mm-hmm.

1623
01:26:24,051 --> 01:26:25,753
-对-是的
-Yeah. -Yep.

1624
01:26:25,886 --> 01:26:27,755
警长，做你该做的
Chief, do what you need to do.

1625
01:26:27,888 --> 01:26:28,989
什么
What?

1626
01:26:29,122 --> 01:26:31,892
你要自首吗？
Y-You're turning yourself in?

1627
01:26:32,025 --> 01:26:33,827
我们可能没偷陨石
We might not have stolen the meteorite,

1628
01:26:33,961 --> 01:26:36,297
但我们确实偷了很多其他东西
but we did steal a lot of other things.

1629
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:38,832
该是我们承担责任的时候了
It's time we took some responsibility.

1630
01:26:38,966 --> 01:26:41,134
开始一个干净的状态
Start a clean state.

1631
01:26:41,935 --> 01:26:43,871
带我们进去，头儿
Take us in, Chief.

1632
01:26:44,672 --> 01:26:46,106
哇，真的吗？
Wow, really?

1633
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:47,541
你终于做到了。
You finally did it.

1634
01:26:47,675 --> 01:26:48,876
这是你的时刻，警长
This is your moment, Chief.

1635
01:26:49,009 --> 01:26:50,244
喝进去
Drink it in.

1636
01:26:50,378 --> 01:26:51,512
哇
Wow.

1637
01:26:51,645 --> 01:26:52,980
你知道，我应该。。。我应该发表演讲
You know, I should... I should give a speech.

1638
01:26:53,113 --> 01:26:54,248
我我应该，不是吗？
I... Well, I-I should, shouldn't I?

1639
01:26:56,216 --> 01:26:57,518
我六岁的时候
When I was six years old,

1640
01:26:57,651 --> 01:26:59,287
我决定玩短笛
I decided that I wanted to play the piccolo,

1641
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:01,255
却发现我的手指
only to find that my fingers were just

1642
01:27:01,389 --> 01:27:04,091
对那个脆弱的小仪器来说太强大了
too powerful for that fragile little instrument.

1643
01:27:04,224 --> 01:27:06,694
就在那时我发现了执法
And that's when I discovered law enforcement.

1644
01:27:08,362 --> 01:27:10,030
我为你感到骄傲，沃尔夫
I'm proud of you, Wolf.

1645
01:27:10,163 --> 01:27:13,367
你知道，狐狸和狼没什么不同
You know, a fox and a wolf are not that different.

1646
01:27:13,501 --> 01:27:15,436
州长，你有一件好事要做
You got a good thing going here, Governor.

1647
01:27:15,569 --> 01:27:17,705
所以，原来是坏人的传奇故事
So, it turns out the saga of the Bad Guys

1648
01:27:17,838 --> 01:27:21,342
得出了一个简单且完全令人满意的结论
has come to a simple and totally satisfying conclusion.

1649
01:27:21,475 --> 01:27:24,177
虽然我想知道，陨石怎么了？
Though I wonder, what happened to the meteorite?

1650
01:27:24,312 --> 01:27:26,113
拥抱！快点，快点！
Cuddles! Faster, faster!

1651
01:27:26,246 --> 01:27:27,815
是迈拉迪教授！
TIFFANY: It's Professor Marmalade!

1652
01:27:27,948 --> 01:27:30,050
他要把陨石带回来
He's bringing the meteorite back.

1653
01:27:30,183 --> 01:27:32,686
嗯？嗯，是的，是的
Huh? Uh, yes, yes. 

1654
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,688
带来。。。把它带回来
Bringing... bringing it back.

1655
01:27:34,822 --> 01:27:36,557
这正是我正在做的
That's precisely what I am doing.

1656
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:41,895
别再看了
Look no further.

1657
01:27:42,029 --> 01:27:44,197
你的英雄来了
Your hero has arrived.

1658
01:27:44,332 --> 01:27:45,766
教授，有什么评论吗？
Professor, care to comment?

1659
01:27:45,899 --> 01:27:47,535
我试着帮他们
I tried to help them

1660
01:27:47,668 --> 01:27:50,338
但最后，还是老故事
but in the end, it's the same old story.

1661
01:27:50,471 --> 01:27:53,374
坏人坏人坏人好人好人
Bad guys bad, good guys good.

1662
01:27:53,507 --> 01:27:55,008
真的。太聪明了
So true. So wise.

1663
01:27:55,142 --> 01:27:56,577
此外，为了城市的利益
Furthermore, for the good of the city,

1664
01:27:56,710 --> 01:27:59,212
我已经慷慨地决定接受这块陨石
I have generously decided to take the meteorite

1665
01:27:59,347 --> 01:28:02,049
回到我的院子里保管
back to my compound for safekeeping.

1666
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,185
他真的要逍遥法外吗？
Is he seriously gonna get away with this?

1667
01:28:05,319 --> 01:28:07,855
非常感谢。天哪，你真好
Thank you. Gosh, you're kind.

1668
01:28:07,988 --> 01:28:09,790
为我放弃吧！
Give it up for me!

1669
01:28:09,923 --> 01:28:11,258
等一下
Wait a second.

1670
01:28:11,392 --> 01:28:13,060
这不是陨石
This isn't the meteorite.

1671
01:28:13,193 --> 01:28:14,762
这是一盏灯
It's a lamp. 

1672
01:28:14,895 --> 01:28:16,029
大家：嗯？
ALL: Huh?

1673
01:28:16,163 --> 01:28:17,631
什么？
What?

1674
01:28:17,765 --> 01:28:19,933
蛇，你刚才做了什么？
Snake, what did you just do?

1675
01:28:20,067 --> 01:28:21,769
什么？我朋友很伤心
SNAKE: What? My friend was sad,

1676
01:28:21,902 --> 01:28:23,036
我只是在鼓励他
and I was just cheering him up.

1677
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:24,672
我认为狼是对的
I think Wolf was right.

1678
01:28:24,805 --> 01:28:27,941
也许我们不只是可怕的恶棍
Maybe we could be more than just scary villains.

1679
01:28:31,111 --> 01:28:32,680
我很坏。你很坏
I'm bad. You're bad.

1680
01:28:32,813 --> 01:28:34,147
让我们一起变坏吧
Let's be bad together.

1681
01:28:34,281 --> 01:28:36,517
你已经达成协议了
You've got yourself a deal.

1682
01:28:38,018 --> 01:28:40,888
-我能试穿一下吗-当然，搭档
-Can I try it on? -Of course, partner.

1683
01:28:55,536 --> 01:28:57,237
别介意我们
Don't mind us.

1684
01:28:57,371 --> 01:28:58,739
只是抢劫这个地方
Just robbing this place.

1685
01:29:03,043 --> 01:29:05,045
不，不，不！
No, no, no!

1686
01:29:08,749 --> 01:29:10,518
但如果那是一盏灯，那么。。。
But if that's a lamp, where is the...

1687
01:29:11,785 --> 01:29:13,020
那个旧开关
The old switcheroo.

1688
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:44,518
是屁股
It's a butt.

1689
01:29:51,291 --> 01:29:52,493
等等
Hold on.

1690
01:29:52,626 --> 01:29:54,895
这是尊邦戈钻石
This is the Zumpango diamond.

1691
01:29:55,028 --> 01:29:56,830
但这是被...
But this was stolen by the...

1692
01:29:58,466 --> 01:30:00,868
用深红色的爪子
By the Crimson Paw.

1693
01:30:01,001 --> 01:30:02,402
我哦，哦，不，不，不
Me? Oh, oh, no, no, no.

1694
01:30:02,536 --> 01:30:04,304
-天哪-不，不，不。不，你弄错了
-OMG. -No, no, no. No, you've got it wrong.

1695
01:30:04,438 --> 01:30:06,273
-一个令人震惊的转折-你犯了个大错！
-And a shocking twist. -You're making a huge mistake!

1696
01:30:06,406 --> 01:30:09,677
臭名昭著的土匪被称为深红色爪子
The notorious bandit known as the Crimson Paw

1697
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:11,411
-据透露是-不不
-has been revealed to be... -No! No!

1698
01:30:11,545 --> 01:30:13,080
不是别人，正是迈拉迪教授。
none other than Professor Marmalade.

1699
01:30:13,213 --> 01:30:14,448
我不是深红色的爪子
I'm not the Crimson Paw.

1700
01:30:14,582 --> 01:30:16,216
她是深红色的爪子
Sh-She's the Crimson Paw. 

1701
01:30:16,349 --> 01:30:17,918
嘘，她是爪子！
Sh-She's the Paw!

1702
01:30:18,051 --> 01:30:20,053
我是善良之花。不
I'm a flower of goodness. No!

1703
01:30:20,187 --> 01:30:22,255
哦！那是我的爬行动物。
Ooh! That's my reptile right there.

1704
01:30:22,389 --> 01:30:24,124
-这就是我说的！好吧-是 啊
-That's what I'm talking about! All right! -Yeah!

1705
01:30:24,257 --> 01:30:26,393
拜托，总得有人摧毁那颗陨石
Come on, somebody had to destroy that meteorite.

1706
01:30:26,527 --> 01:30:28,361
那东西很危险
That thing was dangerous.

1707
01:30:28,496 --> 01:30:30,363
很好，斯纳基
That was pretty good there, Snakey.

1708
01:30:30,498 --> 01:30:32,733
好的这是天才
Good? It was genius.

1709
01:30:32,866 --> 01:30:34,568
我不仅挫败了猪
Not only did I foil the pig,

1710
01:30:34,702 --> 01:30:37,237
我让你承认你有多在乎我
I got you to admit how much you care about me.

1711
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:38,639
当然可以
Sure, yeah.

1712
01:30:38,772 --> 01:30:40,373
我只是想知道一件小事
I just wonder about one little thing.

1713
01:30:40,508 --> 01:30:41,909
哦，是吗？那是什么，狼？
Oh, yeah? What's that, Wolf?

1714
01:30:42,042 --> 01:30:46,246
你觉得是谁把那瓶汽水放进冰箱的？
Who do you think put that one Push Pop in the fridge?

1715
01:30:47,681 --> 01:30:48,982
等待
Wait.

1716
01:30:49,116 --> 01:30:50,651
你...不
You... No.

1717
01:30:50,784 --> 01:30:52,119
我就知道你很好
I knew you were good.

1718
01:30:52,252 --> 01:30:54,522
不
No

1719
01:30:54,655 --> 01:30:57,457
-我们很好，宝贝。我们很好-是 啊
-We good, baby. We good. -Yeah!

1720
01:31:41,902 --> 01:31:44,304
好吧，想象今天是你的生日
Okay, so imagine it's your birthday.

1721
01:31:44,437 --> 01:31:45,806
今天是我的生日
It is my birthday.

1722
01:31:45,939 --> 01:31:47,474
是的，我知道。所以，但我们要继续走下去
Yeah, I know. So, but we're walking along

1723
01:31:47,608 --> 01:31:48,976
你遇到了一个精灵
and you meet a genie.

1724
01:31:49,109 --> 01:31:50,443
好的。他叫什么名字？
Okay. What's his name?

1725
01:31:50,578 --> 01:31:51,812
精灵叫什么名字？
What's the genie's name?

1726
01:31:51,945 --> 01:31:53,446
是的，我想知道我在跟谁说话
Yeah, I want to know who I'm talking to.

1727
01:31:53,581 --> 01:31:54,982
我不知道，简而言之是精灵还是吉恩
I don't know, Genie or Gene for short.

1728
01:31:55,115 --> 01:31:56,650
所以他给了你三个愿望
So he offers you three wishes.

1729
01:31:56,784 --> 01:31:57,818
为什么是三个？
Why three?

1730
01:31:57,951 --> 01:31:59,086
你知道，行业标准
You know, industry standard.

1731
01:31:59,219 --> 01:32:00,487
现在，你想要什么？
Now, what do you wish for?

1732
01:32:00,621 --> 01:32:02,255
-呃-祝你们好运，伙计们
-Uh... -Good luck out there, guys.

1733
01:32:02,389 --> 01:32:03,757
我什么都不想去
I'm gonna go with nothing.

1734
01:32:03,891 --> 01:32:05,058
什么都没有？
Nothing?

1735
01:32:05,192 --> 01:32:06,627
来吧，今天是你的生日
Come on, it's your birthday.

1736
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:08,762
好吧，但我需要什么愿望呢？
All right, but what do I need wishes for?

1737
01:32:08,896 --> 01:32:10,330
我得到了自由
I got my freedom.

1738
01:32:10,463 --> 01:32:11,398
-嘿-伙计们！
-Hey. -Guys!

1739
01:32:11,531 --> 01:32:12,766
看起来不错，赫尔曼诺斯
Looking good, hermanos.

1740
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:14,668
-我有我的朋友-哦
-I got my friends. -Aw.

1741
01:32:14,802 --> 01:32:16,670
我长了一张只有我一半大的爬行动物皮
I got the skin of a reptile half my age.

1742
01:32:16,804 --> 01:32:19,106
我不知道你的年龄有一半，但你看起来不错
I don't know about half your age, but you do look good.

1743
01:32:19,239 --> 01:32:20,574
那是因为你刚刚蜕皮
Well, that's because you just molted.

1744
01:32:20,708 --> 01:32:22,810
-是的-你闻起来也很香
-Yes, I did. -You smell good, too.

1745
01:32:22,943 --> 01:32:26,379
我很闪亮。我很漂亮
I'm shiny. I'm gorgeous. 

1746
01:32:32,185 --> 01:32:35,155
那我们现在该怎么办？
Uh, so what do we do now?

1747
01:32:35,288 --> 01:32:37,057
-偷车-食人鱼！
-Steal a car? -Piranha!

1748
01:32:37,190 --> 01:32:38,859
我在开玩笑
I was joking.

1749
01:32:38,992 --> 01:32:40,327
这是个玩笑
It was a joke.

1750
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:42,062
你知道，仔细想想，沃尔夫
You know, on second thought, Wolf,

1751
01:32:42,195 --> 01:32:44,231
也许我想搭个便车
maybe I'd, uh, wish for a ride.

1752
01:32:44,364 --> 01:32:46,433
哦，是吗？阿拉卡萨姆
Oh, yeah? Alakazam. 

1753
01:32:48,702 --> 01:32:50,003
很好
Nice. 

1754
01:32:50,137 --> 01:32:52,973
嘿，伙计们。准备好开始工作了吗
Hey, guys. Ready to get to work? 

1755
01:32:53,106 --> 01:32:54,274
嘿  哇
Hey. Whoa.

1756
01:32:54,407 --> 01:32:56,276
哦
Aw.

1757
01:32:59,112 --> 01:33:00,313
嘿，你
Hey, you.

1758
01:33:00,447 --> 01:33:01,815
这是正确的 过来
That's right. Come here.

1759
01:33:01,949 --> 01:33:03,083
再近一点
Little closer.

1760
01:33:03,216 --> 01:33:04,785
我说靠近点
I said closer.

1761
01:33:04,918 --> 01:33:08,121
现在我们有时间认识了
Now that we've had some time to get acquainted, uh,

1762
01:33:08,255 --> 01:33:10,758
现在没那么可怕了吧？
not so scary now, are we?

1763
01:33:10,891 --> 01:33:12,259
韦伯斯，出发
Webs, hit it.

1764
01:33:49,000 --> 01:34:00,000
