1
00:00:41,714 --> 00:00:43,182
停下.
SNAKE: Stop.

2
00:00:43,316 --> 00:00:44,950
狼：如果你向我解释一下，我就不说了，
WOLF: I'll stop if you just explain it to me,

3
00:00:45,084 --> 00:00:46,519
-因为我不-请你放下它好吗？
-because I don't... -Would you please just drop it?

4
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:47,986
狼：好吧，好吧，好吧，好吧，好吧，好吧.
WOLF: All right, all right, fine, fine, fine, fine.

5
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:49,122
就当它掉了.它掉了.
Consider it dropped. It's dropped.

6
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:51,257
-它在地上-好的
-It's on the ground. -Good.

7
00:00:52,258 --> 00:00:54,127
但是，我是说，拜托，每个人都喜欢生日.
But, I mean, come on, everybody loves birthdays.

8
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,994
-（呻吟）-你有装饰品.
-(groans) -You got decorations.

9
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:57,996
你有气球.你有派对和蛋糕.
You got balloons. You got parties and cake.

10
00:00:58,131 --> 00:00:59,632
听着 我不需要礼物，
Look, I don't need presents,

11
00:00:59,765 --> 00:01:02,768
我不想要装饰品，我也不喜欢蛋糕.
I don't want decorations, and I'm-I'm not a cake guy.

12
00:01:02,901 --> 00:01:04,737
说真的，你不喜欢蛋糕吗？
Seriously, though, you don't like cake?

13
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,739
说出一种比蛋糕更好的食物.
Name one food better than cake.

14
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:08,006
豚鼠.
Guinea pig.

15
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:09,875
哦，又是豚鼠.
Oh, again with the guinea pig.

16
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:11,944
（笑）：我打赌如果我蒙住你的眼睛，
(chuckling): I bet if I blindfolded you,

17
00:01:12,077 --> 00:01:13,779
你不可能分辨出区别
you wouldn't be able to tell the difference

18
00:01:13,912 --> 00:01:15,748
在臭鼬和豚鼠之间.
between a skunk and a guinea pig.

19
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:18,551
错误的蛇的味蕾无可挑剔.
Wrong. Snakes have impeccable taste buds.

20
00:01:18,684 --> 00:01:20,686
-我能尝到空气的味道-空气
-I can taste air. -Air?

21
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:22,321
对空气
Yes. Air.

22
00:01:22,455 --> 00:01:23,622
（咕噜咕噜）
(slurping)

23
00:01:23,756 --> 00:01:25,291
嗯.美好
Mm. Nice.

24
00:01:25,424 --> 00:01:27,593
我不知道.他们有点...
I don't know. They're a little, uh...

25
00:01:27,726 --> 00:01:29,262
我觉得有点可爱.
a little cute for my taste.

26
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:31,597
这就是它们如此美味的原因.
That's what makes them so delicious.

27
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,499
你不仅仅是在吃东西.
You're not just eating food.

28
00:01:33,632 --> 00:01:35,368
你吃的是纯粹的善良.
You're eating pure goodness.

29
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:36,935
这与猪无关.
It's not about the pig.

30
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:40,439
它在更深层次上象征着什么.
It's about what it symbolizes on a deeper level.

31
00:01:41,774 --> 00:01:43,142
所以，你可以...你能尝到空气的味道吗？
So, you can... you can taste air?

32
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:44,543
-（呻吟）-你还有什么？
-(groans) -What else you got?

33
00:01:44,677 --> 00:01:45,844
-算了吧-等等.
-Forget about it. -W-W-Wait.

34
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:47,546
-你也能听到颜色吗-（呻吟）
-Can you also hear color? -(groans)

35
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,548
-（笑）你能看到声音吗-好吧，好吧.可以
-(chuckles) Can you see sound? -All right, all right. Okay.

36
00:01:49,682 --> 00:01:51,750
因为我们真的应该利用这些技能.
'Cause we should really be capitalizing on these skills.

37
00:01:51,884 --> 00:01:53,619
好吧，好吧.把一切都说出来.
Okay, all right, fine. Get it all out.

38
00:01:53,752 --> 00:01:54,953
-现在把它全部拿出来-好的，好的.
-Get it all out now. -Okay, okay.

39
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:56,555
-（干呕）-（警铃响）
-(retches) -(alarm bell dings)

40
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:58,257
看看这个.下午四点.
Look at that. 4:00 p.m.

41
00:01:58,391 --> 00:02:00,626
现在我知道我们友谊的确切时间了.
Now I know the exact moment our friendship died.

42
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:02,595
（狼笑了）
(Wolf laughs)

43
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:04,463
-让我们跳起来-是的.
-Let's bounce. -Yep.

44
00:02:05,698 --> 00:02:09,034
尝起来像是，你又要给我账单了.
Tastes like, um, you're gonna stick me with the bill-- again.

45
00:02:09,168 --> 00:02:10,936
-（人们喘着粗气）今天是我的生日.
-(people gasping) -Well, it is my birthday.

46
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:12,738
你现在玩生日卡了？
So now you play the birthday card?

47
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:14,573
-这很有趣-（咯咯笑）
-That's interesting. -(chuckling)

48
00:02:14,707 --> 00:02:18,010
当你有机会的时候，能给我们一张支票吗？
Can we get a check, please, when you get a chance?

49
00:02:18,143 --> 00:02:21,046
你好检查检查.
Hello? Checkity-check-check.

50
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,681
-你知道吗-（尖叫声）
-You know what? -(screams)

51
00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:26,118
我们就把钱留在这里，好吗？
We're just gonna leave the money right here, okay?

52
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:27,986
你知道这地方的一个优点吗？
You know the one good thing about this place?

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,888
-什么-我们从来不用等桌子.
-What? -We never have to wait for a table.

54
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:31,324
这不是每个地方吗？
Well, isn't that every place?

55
00:02:31,457 --> 00:02:33,025
嘿，伙计.最近怎么样？我好久没见到你了...
Hey, man. How you been? I haven't seen you in...

56
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:35,160
-蛇攻击！（笑）-（尖叫）
-Snake attack! (chuckles) -(screaming)

57
00:02:35,294 --> 00:02:36,862
哦薄荷糖.
Oh. Mints.

58
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:38,731
抱歉，各位.我要把他换成无咖啡因的.
Sorry, folks. I'm switching him to decaf.

59
00:02:38,864 --> 00:02:40,199
（咯咯笑）
(chuckles)

60
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,467
好吧
All right.

61
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,236
-两个：让我们这样做-（入口铃声）
-BOTH: Let's do this. -(entry bell jingles)

62
00:02:43,369 --> 00:02:46,605
-（人们喘息、尖叫）-（轮胎尖叫）

-(tires squeal) -(crashing)

65
00:02:56,415 --> 00:02:57,616
豚鼠？
Guinea pig, huh?

66
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,618
这是啮齿动物中的劳斯莱斯.
It's the Rolls-Royce of rodents.

67
00:02:59,752 --> 00:03:01,387
是的，但它还是一只啮齿动物.
Yeah, but it's still a rodent.

68
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,356
你知道我的意思吗？
You know what I mean?

69
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:05,524
-别介意我们，只是抢劫这个地方-（喘息）
-Don't mind us, just robbing this place. -(gasping)

（发动机转速、轮胎吱吱声）
(engine revs, tires squeal)

74
00:03:19,472 --> 00:03:20,673
哇！是 啊
Whoo! Yeah!

75
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:22,508
-变坏-或者回家.
-Go bad... -Or go home.

76
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:23,942
（两人都笑了）
(both laugh)

77
00:03:28,146 --> 00:03:31,016
嘿，你.过来.
Hey, you. Get over here.

再近一点.
Little bit closer.

79
00:03:33,752 --> 00:03:36,054
哦，我知道是什么.

80
00:03:36,188 --> 00:03:39,858
你害怕是因为我是...大灰狼.
You're afraid because I'm the... the Big Bad Wolf.

81
00:03:39,992 --> 00:03:41,660
我并不惊讶.
Well, I'm not surprised.

82
00:03:41,794 --> 00:03:43,562
我是每个故事中的反派.
I am the villain in every story.

83
00:03:43,696 --> 00:03:44,797
是吗，斯内克先生？
Isn't that right, Mr. Snake?

84
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,198
（咯咯笑）：是的.
(chuckling): Yep.

85
00:03:46,332 --> 00:03:49,302
向斯内克先生问好.

想象一下胡迪尼没有手臂.
Imagine Houdini but with no arms.

88
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:55,608
那种会告诉你杯子有一半空的人，
Kind of guy who'd tell you the glass is half empty,

89
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:57,009
然后从你那里偷来.
then steal it from you.

90
00:03:57,142 --> 00:03:58,511
他也是我最好的朋友.
He's also my best bud.

91
00:03:58,644 --> 00:04:00,979
今天是他的生日！
(singsongy): And today's his birthday!

92
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:03,181
-不相关-他是个甜心.

00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:10,375
吐出来！吐出来！
Spit it out! Spit it out!

276
00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:11,844
从不
Never!

277
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:13,611
让我们看看他们今天在说什么.
Let's see what they're saying about us today.

278
00:11:13,746 --> 00:11:15,413
怎么了？这里是Tiffany Fluffit，第六频道动作新闻.
What up? It's Tiffany Fluffit, Channel 6 Action News.

279
00:11:15,547 --> 00:11:17,349
坏人又袭击了...
The Bad Guys have struck again...

280
00:11:17,482 --> 00:11:20,452
伙计们，伙计们，住手.我们在电视上.
Guys, guys, stop it. We're on TV.

281
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:22,020
-哦，哦！-...再次证明他们
-Ooh, ooh! -...proving once more that they

282
00:11:22,154 --> 00:11:24,589
是我们这个时代最邪恶的罪犯.
are the most diabolical criminals of our time.

283
00:11:24,723 --> 00:11:27,559
哦，“恶魔”这是新的.
Ooh, "diabolical." That's new.

284
00:11:27,692 --> 00:11:29,227
知道这听起来像什么吗？古龙水.
Know what it sounds like? A cologne.

285
00:11:29,361 --> 00:11:30,595
（戏剧性地）：恶魔般的.
(dramatically): Diabolical.

286
00:11:30,729 --> 00:11:32,497
蒂芙尼：为了应对这场令人发指的犯罪狂潮
TIFFANY: To address this heinous crime spree

287
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,600
是新当选的州长黛安·福辛顿.
is the newly elected governor, Diane Foxington.

288
00:11:35,734 --> 00:11:37,002
-州长-黛安：好的.是 啊
-Governor? -DIANE: Okay. Yeah.

289
00:11:37,135 --> 00:11:38,904
-我听到了.我听到了-（记者叫嚣）
-I hear you. I hear you. -(reporters clamoring)

290
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:42,607
听着，听着.我们都知道坏人有多卑鄙.
Listen, listen. We all know how dastardly the Bad Guys are.

291
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:45,677
-狼：当然了-但最重要的是...
-WOLF: You bet we are. -But more than anything...

292
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:48,280
（笑）我为他们感到难过.
(chuckles) I feel sorry for them.

293
00:11:48,413 --> 00:11:50,048
什么
What?

294
00:11:50,182 --> 00:11:51,784
这些所谓的坏人
These so-called Bad Guys

295
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:54,552
都是二流的.
are really just second-rate has-beens.

296
00:11:54,686 --> 00:11:56,588
在他们业余的滑稽动作背后
Behind their amateurish antics

297
00:11:56,721 --> 00:11:58,857
坦率地说，还有一些非原创的胡闹--
and, frankly, unoriginal capers--

298
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:00,793
我是说，真的，另一家银行--
I mean, really, another bank?--

299
00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:03,228
只不过是一口愤怒的深井...
is nothing but a deep well of anger...

300
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:04,629
我没生气！你生气了！
I ain't angry! You're angry!

301
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:06,398
-...否认-不是真的.
-...denial... -Not true.

302
00:12:06,531 --> 00:12:07,665
...自我厌恶.
...and self-loathing.

303
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,802
我唯一讨厌的人就是你.
The only one I self-loathe is you.

304
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:12,270
这些漏洞没有多少现金
And those are holes that no amount of cash

305
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:15,507
或者说无价的艺术永远无法填满.
or priceless art can ever fill.

306
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:19,577
食品网络上有什么？
What's on the Food Network?

307
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:21,246
黛安：那么，我们能不能忘了...
DIANE: So, can we just forget about...

308
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:22,848
她是谁来评判我们？
Who-who is she to judge us?

309
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:24,817
-黛安：...专注于更积极的事情-（咆哮）
-DIANE: ...and focus on more positive things? -(growls)

310
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,484
还有什么比这更积极的呢
And what could be more positive

311
00:12:26,618 --> 00:12:28,620
比一年一度的好撒马利亚奖，
than the Annual Good Samaritan Awards,

312
00:12:28,753 --> 00:12:31,723
明晚我将在那里展示金海豚
where tomorrow night I will present the Golden Dolphin

313
00:12:31,857 --> 00:12:35,193
献给今年最优秀的公民？
to this year's goodest citizen?

314
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:36,561
我不敢相信我投了她的票.
I can't believe I voted for her.

315
00:12:36,694 --> 00:12:37,963
你投了她的票？
You voted for her?

316
00:12:38,096 --> 00:12:40,632
狼蛛：什么？她擅长气候变化.
TARANTULA: What? She's good on climate change.

317
00:12:40,765 --> 00:12:42,400
等待发生什么事？
Wait. What's going on?

318
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:45,037
你的眼睛闪闪发光.
You've got that twinkle in your eye.

319
00:12:46,872 --> 00:12:50,042
伙计们，谁要换工作？
Guys, who's up for another job?

320
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:51,443
一个大的.
A big one.

321
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:53,045
（喘息）
(all gasp)

322
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:55,680
金色海豚.
SNAKE: The Golden Dolphin.

323
00:12:55,814 --> 00:12:57,315
-真的吗-哦
-Seriously? -Oh.

324
00:12:57,449 --> 00:12:58,951
我以为我疯了.
I thought I was the crazy one.

325
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:01,453
那项工作使每一个尝试过的罪犯都崩溃了.
That job has broken every criminal who's tried it.

326
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:04,122
布加勒斯特强盗，幸运的吉姆.
The Bucharest Bandits, Lucky Jim.

327
00:13:04,256 --> 00:13:05,924
鲨鱼：深红色的爪子.
SHARK: The Crimson Paw.

328
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:07,759
事实上，那只深红色的爪子从未被捕.
Actually, the Crimson Paw was never arrested.

329
00:13:07,893 --> 00:13:10,228
是的，但他再也没偷过东西了.
Yeah, but he never stole anything again.

330
00:13:10,362 --> 00:13:11,964
斯内克，还有更好的办法吗
Snake, what better way

331
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:14,466
擦掉州长模糊的脸上的假笑
to wipe that smirk off the governor's fuzzy face

332
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,901
而不是偷金海豚
than stealing the Golden Dolphin

333
00:13:16,034 --> 00:13:17,903
就在她胡子底下？
from right under her whiskers?

334
00:13:18,036 --> 00:13:20,638
这是盗窃的圣杯.
This is the Holy Grail of thievery.

335
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:22,841
如果我们成功，我们将巩固我们的遗产
If we pull this off, we'll cement our legacy

336
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:25,243
作为史上最伟大的罪犯.
as the greatest criminals of all time.

337
00:13:25,377 --> 00:13:26,879
伙计.
Whoa, whoa, buddy.

338
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:29,514
我以为我们不该把事情说成是私事.
I thought we weren't supposed to make things personal.

339
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:31,549
此外，我们有一件好事要做.
Besides, we've got a good thing going here.

340
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:35,620
朋友们，自由，看看这些战利品.
Friends, freedom, and just look at this loot.

341
00:13:36,421 --> 00:13:37,722
好吧，你说得对.算了吧.
All right, you're right. Forget it.

342
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:40,025
-海豚队的任务结束了-好的
-The Dolphin job is off. -Good.

343
00:13:40,158 --> 00:13:42,460
我猜猪终究会得到他的奖杯.
I guess the pig will get his trophy after all.

344
00:13:42,594 --> 00:13:44,762
是的，我想他会...
Yeah, I guess he would...

345
00:13:44,897 --> 00:13:46,498
“猪”是什么意思？
What do you mean, "pig"?

346
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:48,100
哦，是的，我没提吗？
Oh, yes, did I not mention that?

347
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:50,702
真奇怪.我想我提到了，呃...
That's weird. I thought I mentioned that it was, uh...

348
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,238
善良的撒玛利亚人是...
The Good Samaritan is...

349
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:54,539
一只豚鼠？
A guinea pig?

350
00:13:54,672 --> 00:13:56,208
（咕噜咕噜）
(slurping)

351
00:13:56,341 --> 00:13:57,609
你说呢，斯纳基？
What do you say, Snakey?

352
00:13:57,742 --> 00:13:58,977
比蛋糕好.
Better than cake.

353
00:13:59,111 --> 00:14:00,578
-（笑声）-狼蛛：对.
-(laughter) -TARANTULA: Right.

354
00:14:00,712 --> 00:14:03,381
（呻吟）好的.好的
(groans) Okay. Fine.

355
00:14:03,515 --> 00:14:05,083
但他最好是美味的.
But he better be delicious.

356
00:14:05,217 --> 00:14:07,285
（笑）我们都在一起吗？
(laughs) Are we all in this together?

357
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:10,989
计划是这样的.
So here's the plan.

358
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:13,358
和每年一样，仪式也将举行
Like every year, the ceremony will be held

359
00:14:13,491 --> 00:14:15,160
在美术馆，
at the Museum of Fine Arts,

360
00:14:15,293 --> 00:14:17,729
金海豚将被安置在哪里
where the Golden Dolphin will be positioned

361
00:14:17,862 --> 00:14:20,332
就在后台的幕布后面.
just beyond the backstage curtain.

362
00:14:20,465 --> 00:14:21,666
听起来很简单.
Sounds easy.

363
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,835
听起来很容易，赫尔曼诺，但要达到目的，
Sounds easy, hermano, but to get there,

364
00:14:23,969 --> 00:14:26,204
我们需要绕过三个安全级别.
we'll need to bypass three levels of security.

365
00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:28,773
所以，第一步：我们需要融入其中.
So, step one: We'll need to blend in.

366
00:14:28,907 --> 00:14:30,542
（“为你嚎叫”由黑键演奏）
("Howlin' for You" by The Black Keys playing)

367
00:14:30,675 --> 00:14:33,145
*宝贝，我在为你嚎叫*
* Baby, I'm howlin' for you *

368
00:14:35,147 --> 00:14:37,082
*达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达达*
* Da-da da-da da, da-da da-da da... *

369
00:14:37,215 --> 00:14:38,850
Marmalade教授，
WOLF: Professor Marmalade,

370
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:41,119
今年的金海豚奖得主，
this year's recipient of the Golden Dolphin,

371
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:43,655
地球上最令人讨厌的好生物.
the most annoying good creature on the planet.

372
00:14:43,788 --> 00:14:46,258
教授，在过去的一年里，你停止了战争，
Professor, in the past year, you've stopped wars,

373
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:48,793
给饥饿的人喂食，拯救了无数的熊猫.
fed the hungry and saved countless pandas.

374
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:50,528
有些人描述了你的善良
Some have described your goodness

375
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:52,597
仅次于特蕾莎修女.
as second only to Mother Teresa.

376
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,167
哦，蒂芙尼，这不是比赛.
Oh, Tiffany, it's not a competition.

377
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,735
如果是的话，那就更像是平局了.
And if it were, it would really be more of a tie.

378
00:14:57,869 --> 00:15:00,939
但我们都同意，有一朵善良之花
But we can all agree that there is a flower of goodness

379
00:15:01,073 --> 00:15:04,009
在我们所有人的内心，等待着绽放.
inside all of us, just waiting to blossom.

380
00:15:04,142 --> 00:15:06,945
狼：一进门，就有两扇装甲门.
WOLF: Once inside, there are two armored doors.

381
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,281
第一个只能由
The first can only be opened by

382
00:15:09,414 --> 00:15:11,049
随身携带的特殊钥匙卡
a special key card that is carried

383
00:15:11,183 --> 00:15:12,951
我们亲爱的朋友，警察局长.
by our dear friend, the chief of police.

384
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:14,953
第二台装有视网膜扫描仪
The second is outfitted with a retinal scanner

385
00:15:15,087 --> 00:15:17,755
由一支精英特种部队守卫
and guarded by an elite special ops unit

386
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:20,392
经过训练，可以先罢工，然后再提问.
trained to strike first and ask questions later.

387
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:22,027
-（苍蝇嗡嗡声）-（嗖嗖声）
-(fly buzzes) -(whooshing)

388
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,362
福辛顿州长是唯一一个
Governor Foxington is the only one

389
00:15:24,496 --> 00:15:26,331
他有打开第二扇门的许可.
who has clearance to open the second door.

390
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:28,733
所以，第二步：她和我需要
So, step two: She and I will need to get

391
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:30,535
近距离的和私人的.
up close and personal.

392
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:32,337
祝你晚上愉快，大使先生.
Enjoy your evening, Mr. Ambassador.

393
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,505
谢谢你，女士.
Thank you, ma'am.

394
00:15:33,638 --> 00:15:35,040
很有意思.
Interesting piece.

395
00:15:35,173 --> 00:15:38,576
无用的、毫无意义的、自命不凡的.
Trashy, pointless and pretentious.

396
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,079
他们说艺术揭示了
Hmm. They say that art reveals

397
00:15:41,213 --> 00:15:42,880
与其说是艺术家，不如说是观众.
more about the viewer than the artist.

398
00:15:43,015 --> 00:15:44,449
-（笑）-先生...
-(chuckles) -Mister...

399
00:15:44,582 --> 00:15:46,618
普德尔顿.奥利弗·普德尔顿.
Poodleton. Oliver Poodleton.

400
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:47,719
黛安：嗯...可以
DIANE: Uh... okay.

401
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:49,754
是时候有人站起来了
It's about time someone stood up

402
00:15:49,887 --> 00:15:52,124
给那些邪恶的坏蛋.
to those diabolical Bad Guys.

403
00:15:52,257 --> 00:15:55,260
不过，我得说，还没有人成功.
Though, I've got to say, no one's succeeded yet.

404
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:57,996
嗯.我觉得没那么难.
Eh. I don't think it'll be that hard.

405
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,132
我感觉会比你想象的更难.
I have a feeling it'll be harder than you think.

406
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:02,267
我得说他们就差一个史诗般的工作了
I'd say they're one epic job away

407
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,102
巩固他们的遗产.
from cementing their legacy.

408
00:16:04,236 --> 00:16:06,704
-（黛安笑了）-（狼笑了）
-(Diane laughing) -(Wolf chuckles)

409
00:16:06,838 --> 00:16:08,573
普德尔顿先生，你真有趣.
Mr. Poodleton, you're-you're funny.

410
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:10,142
我是？
I am?

411
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:12,544
他们正在巩固的唯一遗产是终身监禁.
The only legacy they're cementing is life in prison.

412
00:16:12,677 --> 00:16:14,379
你看到他们上一份工作了吗？
Did you see their last job?

413
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:15,980
啊.安全出口，
Ugh. Unsecured exits,

414
00:16:16,114 --> 00:16:18,383
粗鲁的伪装，强迫性的表演.
crude disguises, compulsive showboating.

415
00:16:18,516 --> 00:16:19,884
我是说，那是一团糟.
I mean, it was a mess.

416
00:16:20,018 --> 00:16:22,687
船员衰落的所有经典迹象.
All the classic signs of a crew in decline.

417
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,757
下一步，他们会把它变成私人的.
Next, they're gonna make it personal.

418
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,393
这时你就知道他们是土司了.
That's when you know they're toast.

419
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:31,663
（笑）：嗯，那是你的意见.
(chuckles): Uh, well, that's your opinion.

420
00:16:31,796 --> 00:16:34,332
是的，我是州长.
It is, and I'm the governor.

421
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:39,437
至于雕塑，我认为它是关于透视的.
As for the sculpture, I think it's about perspective.

422
00:16:39,571 --> 00:16:41,273
如果你仔细观察，
If you look closely enough,

423
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:45,943
即使是垃圾也可以被回收成美丽的东西.
even trash can be recycled into something beautiful.

424
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:48,113
狼：怎么样？
WOLF: How about that?

425
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:52,584
我猜有些事情并不总是表面上的样子.
I guess some things aren't always as they appear.

426
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:53,918
这提醒了我.
That reminds me.

427
00:16:54,052 --> 00:16:55,720
我可以吗？我不能错过拍照机会
May I? I can't miss a photo op

428
00:16:55,853 --> 00:16:57,355
州长和一堆垃圾.
with the governor and a pile of garbage.

429
00:16:57,489 --> 00:17:00,925
哦，普德尔顿先生，你对自己太苛刻了.
Oh, Mr. Poodleton, you're too hard on yourself.

430
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:02,594
-嘿-（相机咔哒声）
-Hey... -(camera clicks)

431
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:05,097
（安静的闲聊、笑声）
(quiet chatter, laughter)

432
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,698
好的，朋友们.
WOLF: Okay, friends.

433
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:08,633
表演时间到了.
It's showtime.

434
00:17:10,368 --> 00:17:12,437
一旦我们进入，就进入第三步：
Once we're in, it's on to step three:

435
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,140
我们分道扬镳，各就各位.
We split up and we take our positions.

436
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:18,843
警官们，如果坏人破坏了这场比赛，
Officers, if the Bad Guys crash this event,

437
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:20,945
我肯定会失业，
I am definitely going to lose my job,

438
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,282
我会毫不犹豫地把你带走.
and I will not hesitate to take you down with me.

439
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,151
-现在，搬出去-警官：是的，女士！
-Now, move out. -OFFICERS: Yes, ma'am!

440
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:27,819
小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,

441
00:17:27,952 --> 00:17:29,654
小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋...
hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut...

442
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:46,538
麦克风开了.所有人都在通话，收到了吗？
Mic's on. Everyone on comms, do you copy?

443
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:47,772
-收到-收到-复制
-Copy. -Copy. -Copy.

444
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:49,474
（高音）：收到.
(high-pitched voice): Copy.

445
00:17:57,682 --> 00:17:59,817
（笑）
(laughs)

446
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:09,861
给这位漂亮女士喝一杯？
A drink for the pretty lady?

447
00:18:09,994 --> 00:18:12,630
不用了，谢谢.我现在的生活太复杂了.
No, thank you. My life is too complicated right now.

448
00:18:12,764 --> 00:18:14,466
呃，呃...
Uh, uh...

449
00:18:21,673 --> 00:18:24,242
（吹口哨）
(whistling a tune)

450
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,595
孩子们，这是海豚的季节.
Boys, it's Dolphin season.

451
00:18:43,728 --> 00:18:44,862
（低声咕哝）
(muffled grunting)

452
00:18:44,996 --> 00:18:46,564
（裤子拉链）
(pants zip)

453
00:18:46,698 --> 00:18:49,201
收到.我要走了.
Copy that. I'm on the move.

454
00:18:50,335 --> 00:18:52,170
第二单元，后台区域还安全吗？
Unit two, is the backstage area still secure?

455
00:18:52,304 --> 00:18:53,538
警官（通过无线电）：第二单元.一切正常.
OFFICER (over radio): Unit two. All clear.

456
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:55,973
这是所有培训的回报.
This is where all the training pays off.

457
00:18:56,107 --> 00:18:57,709
-（咕哝，呻吟）-哦，原谅我.
-(grunts, groans) -Oh, pardon me.

458
00:18:57,842 --> 00:18:59,677
-非常抱歉-没问题，先生.
-Terribly sorry. -Not a problem, sir.

459
00:18:59,811 --> 00:19:01,713
孩子们，睁大眼睛.
Keep your eyes open, boys.

460
00:19:01,846 --> 00:19:05,817
他们可能在任何地方，只是等着羞辱我们.
They could be anywhere, just waiting to humiliate us.

461
00:19:06,618 --> 00:19:08,353
（笑）
(laughs)

462
00:19:08,486 --> 00:19:10,054
狼已经就位了.
Wolf is in position.

463
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:12,524
（通过广播）：食人鱼，你们都穿着企鹅服，穿着靴子吗？
(over radio): Piranha, you all penguin-suited and booted?

464
00:19:12,657 --> 00:19:16,093
肯定的我是一个干净，卑鄙，偷海豚的机器.
Affirmative. I'm a clean, mean, Dolphin-stealing machine.

465
00:19:16,228 --> 00:19:18,129
怎么了，伙计们？
What's going on, guys?

466
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:22,900
（隐约的喋喋不休）
(indistinct chatter)

467
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,312
（咕哝）
(grunts)

468
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:43,588
（女人咕哝着）
(woman grunting)

469
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:56,133
（两声尖叫）
(both yelp)

470
00:19:58,069 --> 00:19:59,771
（女人喘着气）
(woman gasping)

471
00:19:59,904 --> 00:20:01,273
（叹息）
(sighs)

472
00:20:01,406 --> 00:20:03,508
-来，我来帮你-哦.
-Here, let me help you. -Ooh.

473
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:04,876
你没事吧，夫人？
Are you okay, ma'am?

474
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:08,045
（喘息）：哦，天哪，是的.
(panting): Oh, my gracious, yes.

475
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:11,716
我可能会头晕，但多亏了你，我还活着.
I may be dizzy, but I'm alive, thanks to you.

476
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:13,418
-狼：你是什么-哦
-WOLF: What are you... -Oh.

477
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:14,786
嗯.
Mm.

478
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:16,354
（狼呜咽）
(Wolf whimpers)

479
00:20:16,488 --> 00:20:19,090
谢谢你，亲爱的.
Thank you, dear.

480
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:22,927
你真是个好孩子.
You're such a good boy.

481
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,029
（轻声笑）
(chuckles softly)

482
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:26,964
（女人咕哝着）
(woman grunting)

483
00:20:31,836 --> 00:20:34,071
（呜咽）
(whimpers)

484
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,348
好吗，兄弟？
All good, brother?

485
00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:46,751
是的，所有...很好.是的，是的.
Yeah, all... a-all good. Yeah, yeah.

486
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:48,320
嗯...（噼啪声）
Um... (splutters)

487
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:50,922
韦伯斯，继续第四步怎么样？
Webs, what do you say about moving on to step four?

488
00:20:51,055 --> 00:20:53,691
收到.Shark，你起来了.
Copy that. Shark, you're up.

489
00:20:53,825 --> 00:20:55,993
-做你的事-（喘息）我可以即兴创作吗？
-Do your thing. -(gasps) Do I get to improvise?

490
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:58,029
是的，很好.即兴创作
Yes, fine. Improvise.

491
00:20:58,162 --> 00:20:59,797
但请小心点.
But please be subtle.

492
00:20:59,931 --> 00:21:01,666
嗯.
Mm-hmm.

493
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,437
（高音）：我要生孩子了！
(high-pitched voice): I'm having a baby!

494
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,904
有医生吗？
Is there a doctor?

495
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:08,973
或者几个保安
Or perhaps several security guards

496
00:21:09,106 --> 00:21:10,908
可以离开他们的岗位帮助我吗？
that could leave their post and help me?

497
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:12,176
-（两人都喘着粗气）-（客人喃喃地说）
-(both gasp) -(guests murmuring)

498
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,011
（电梯铃响）

（锁发出哔哔声）
(lock beeping)

500
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:32,630
“鱼惊喜”？
"Fish surprise"?

501
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:35,500
惊喜（大叫）
Surprise! (yells)

502
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:37,635
（警卫咕哝着）
(guards grunting)

503
00:21:42,674 --> 00:21:44,342
嘿，韦伯斯，你能把这个...
Hey, Webs, can you enhance this...

504
00:21:44,476 --> 00:21:47,044
狼蛛：完成了.你前面八步，沃尔夫.
TARANTULA: Done. Eight steps ahead of you, Wolfie.

505
00:21:53,385 --> 00:21:54,318
（笑）
(laughs)

506
00:21:54,452 --> 00:21:55,687
播音员：女士们，先生们，

508
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,224
（喘着粗气）
(breathing heavily)

509
00:22:00,358 --> 00:22:02,193
沃尔夫（通过无线电）：好了，鲨鱼，我们进去了.
WOLF (over radio): All right, Shark, we're in.

510
00:22:02,326 --> 00:22:04,396
（正常声音）：哎呀，我忘了，我没有怀孕.
(normal voice): Oops, I forgot, I'm not pregnant.

511
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:06,564
播音员：...委员会主席，

非常感谢.
Thank you.

515
00:22:14,171 --> 00:22:17,074
去年，我们面临着最大的考验
Last year, we faced our biggest test

516
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:20,678
当一颗陨石撞上我们亲爱的城市.
when a meteorite crashed into our dear city.

517
00:22:20,812 --> 00:22:23,781
那颗陨石不仅在我们的城市里留下了一个洞.
That meteorite didn't just make a hole in our city.

518
00:22:23,915 --> 00:22:25,783
它在我们心中留下了一个洞.
It made a hole in our hearts.

519
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:27,719
-人群：哦-（鲨鱼抽泣）
-CROWD: Aw. -(Shark sniffles)

520
00:22:27,852 --> 00:22:30,121
但即使在悲剧中，Marmalade教授，
But even in tragedy, Professor Marmalade,

521
00:22:30,254 --> 00:22:31,956
他做得很好.
he did what he does so well.

522
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:34,459
他让我们用不同的眼光看待事物.
He made us look at things differently.

523
00:22:34,592 --> 00:22:36,293
多亏了你，果酱，
And thanks to you, Marmalade,

524
00:22:36,428 --> 00:22:40,031
爱情陨石坑将永远成为一个象征
the Love Crater Meteorite will forever serve as a symbol

525
00:22:40,164 --> 00:22:43,801
即使在最糟糕的地方也有好的一面.
of how there is good even in the worst places.

526
00:22:43,935 --> 00:22:45,403
（掌声）
(applause)

527
00:22:45,537 --> 00:22:46,804
哇！
Whoo!

00:22:46,938 --> 00:22:48,673
（黛安模糊地继续说）

529
00:22:48,806 --> 00:22:50,241
（食人鱼大笑，咕哝）

530
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,413
（咕哝）

532
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,351

...成功扭转了气候变化

为了我们所有人的幸福.

事情进展得出人意料地顺利.
This is going surprisingly smoothly.

536

（狼叫声）
(Wolf yelps)

538
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,202
那是什么蜕皮？
What the molt is that?

狼：狼食人鱼蛇鲨狼蛛

00:23:21,873 --> 00:23:24,241
-这是不应该发生的-什么
-This was not supposed to happen. -What?

542
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,277
伙计们，冷静点.我会的.
Guys, calm down. I'm on it.

543
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,781
正在启动WPSST覆盖协议.（咯咯笑）
Initiating WPSST override protocol. (chuckles)

544
00:23:29,914 --> 00:23:31,082
明白了，皇后！
Get it, queen!

545
00:23:31,215 --> 00:23:32,584
（电脑嗡嗡响）
(computer buzzes)

546
00:23:32,717 --> 00:23:34,852
-狼：有用吗-给我五分钟.
-WOLF: Did it work? -Just give me five minutes.

547
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:38,322
现在，请和我一起欢迎来到舞台上...
And now, please join me in welcoming to the stage...

548
00:23:38,456 --> 00:23:40,091
我们没有五分钟了.
We don't have five minutes.

549
00:23:40,224 --> 00:23:42,326
...Marmalade教授.

我们爱你，果酱教授！
We love you, Professor Marmalade!

552
00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:47,098
猪在动.
The pig is on the move.

553
00:23:47,231 --> 00:23:49,366
我再说一遍，猪在动.
I repeat, the pig is on the move.

554
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:51,869
织网，织网，窗帘随时都会升起.
Webs, Webs, the curtain's going up any minute.

555
00:23:52,003 --> 00:23:53,070
它不让我进去.
It's not letting me in.

556
00:23:53,204 --> 00:23:54,371
检查你的系统偏好.
Check your system preferences.

557
00:23:54,506 --> 00:23:55,807
你可能需要下载一个驱动程序.

尝试重新启动.
Try rebooting.

559
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,409
天哪，你修好了.
Oh, my gosh, you fixed it.

560
00:23:58,543 --> 00:23:59,644
-蛇和狼：真的吗-不
-SNAKE and WOLF: Really? -No!

561
00:23:59,777 --> 00:24:01,546
-警长：嘿，拉里.
-(door rattling) -CHIEF: Hey, Larry.

562
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,647
来吧，开门.
Come on, open up.

563
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,448
关于锁门我们说了什么？
What did we say about locking doors?

564
00:24:04,582 --> 00:24:06,918
哦，不，不，不，不，不，鲨鱼，我这里有情况.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Shark, I got a situation here.

565
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:08,252
鲨鱼：收到.我在路上.
SHARK: Copy that. I'm on my way.

566
00:24:08,385 --> 00:24:10,154
-（肚子咕噜）-（咕噜声）
-(stomach burbling) -(grunts)

567
00:24:10,287 --> 00:24:11,523
快点，伙计们.
Hurry up, guys.

568
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:14,158
是时候让这个婴儿进入野兽模式了.

吃了它，WPSST！

570
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:24,602
拜托，现在不行.（呜咽）
Please, not now. (whimpers)

571
00:24:24,736 --> 00:24:26,403
-狼-等等，等等，等等.不，不，食人鱼！
-Wolf. -Wait, wait, wait. No, no, Piranha!

572
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:29,273

-This award is for... -(Piranha farts loudly)

573
00:24:30,307 --> 00:24:32,076
（清了清嗓子）就像我说的...
(clears throat) As I was saying...

574
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:35,580
不，不，不，不，不，不，不，不，不，不，不，不，不！

（嗅嗅）
(sniffing)

576
00:24:39,784 --> 00:24:42,453
-食人鱼！你在开玩笑吗-食人鱼：对不起！
-Piranha! Are you kidding me? -PIRANHA: Sorry!

577
00:24:42,587 --> 00:24:44,689
这就是为什么我的慈善晚会
And that's why my Gala for Goodness

578
00:24:44,822 --> 00:24:47,592
将为那些不幸的人筹集所需的所有资金.
will raise all the money needed for those less fortunate.

579
00:24:47,725 --> 00:24:48,960
-警长：来吧-（砰砰地敲门）
-CHIEF: Come on! -(pounding at door)

580
00:24:49,093 --> 00:24:50,261
（深深地吸气）
(inhales deeply)

581
00:24:50,862 --> 00:24:53,297
我开始生气了，拉里.
I'm starting to get mad here, Larry.

582
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:55,833
-狼：网！网-（低声咕哝）
-WOLF: Webs! Webs! -(muffled grunting)

583
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:59,604
现在是我们一直在等待的时刻.
And now the moment we've all been waiting for.

584
00:25:01,005 --> 00:25:03,708
-（呜咽）哇！
-(whimpering) -Whoa!

585
00:25:09,246 --> 00:25:10,682
（呻吟）
(groans)

586
00:25:13,885 --> 00:25:15,119
鲨鱼（高音）：对不起.
SHARK (high-pitched voice): Excuse me.

587
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:16,754
这是女厕所吗？
Is this the ladies' room?

588
00:25:16,888 --> 00:25:18,923
你得右转
Oh, uh, y-you need to take a right

589
00:25:19,056 --> 00:25:20,925
在大厅的尽头，女士.
at the end of the hall, ma'am.

590
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:23,360
（喘息）
(gasping)

591
00:25:26,197 --> 00:25:28,499
对哇哇！
Yes. Whoop-bam!

592
00:25:29,801 --> 00:25:30,868
哦，来吧！
Oh, come on!

593
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:35,272
现在我很荣幸授予Marmalade教授
And now it is my honor to award Professor Marmalade

594
00:25:35,406 --> 00:25:39,476
和金海豚一起！
with the Golden Dolphin!

595
00:25:41,178 --> 00:25:42,479
-（喘息）不-不.
-(gasps) No. -No.

596
00:25:42,614 --> 00:25:43,748
（正常声音）：是的！
(normal voice): Yes!

597
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:46,117
（高音）：我是说，是的！
(high-pitched voice): I mean, yes!

598
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,919
什么
What?

599
00:25:50,154 --> 00:25:52,023
（尖叫声）
(screams)

600
00:25:52,957 --> 00:25:55,259
大家，大家，请不要惊慌.
Everyone, everyone, uh, please don't panic.

601
00:25:55,392 --> 00:25:56,694
保持冷静.
Just stay calm.

602
00:25:56,828 --> 00:25:59,130
我相信这是有原因的.
I'm-I'm sure there's an explanation for this.

603
00:25:59,263 --> 00:26:00,397
（喘息，低语）
(gasping, murmuring)

604
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:04,001
我再说一遍，请不要惊慌.
I repeat, uh, please do not panic.

605
00:26:05,603 --> 00:26:07,271
大家干得好.
Nice work, everybody.

606
00:26:07,404 --> 00:26:10,407
现在，让我们像狼一样，把狼群带出去.
Now, let's make like a wolf and get the pack out of here.

607
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:12,409
啊，文字游戏.
Ah, wordplay.

608
00:26:12,543 --> 00:26:13,711
我不明白.
I don't get it.

609
00:26:13,845 --> 00:26:15,713
果酱：黛安，黛安，如果我可以...
MARMALADE: Diane, Diane, if I may...

610
00:26:15,847 --> 00:26:17,915
-（麦克风反馈尖叫声）-你必须理解，
-(microphone feedback squeals) -You have to understand,

611
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:21,185
我没有为获奖而把希望带回城市.
I didn't bring hope back to the city for an award.

612
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:25,222
我做这些好事是因为它们给我的感觉.
I did these good things because of how they made me feel.

613
00:26:25,356 --> 00:26:26,858
我有种刺痛的感觉.
That tingly feeling I get.

614
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:28,292
让我脊梁骨颤抖.
That shiver up my spine.

615
00:26:28,425 --> 00:26:32,196
我的小尾巴在摇摆.
The wag in my tiny tail.

616
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:34,165
因为，你看，
Because, you see,

617
00:26:34,298 --> 00:26:38,535
感觉很好.
being good just feels so good.

618
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:42,674
当你很好的时候，你会被爱.
And when you're good, you're loved.

619
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:45,777
-（喘息，呜咽）-狼？
-(gasps, whimpers) -Wolf?

620
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,311
-狼-你在做什么？
-Wolf? -What are you doing?

621
00:26:47,444 --> 00:26:49,413
蛇、鲨鱼和食人鱼：走！
SNAKE, SHARK and PIRANHA: Go!

622
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:51,348
-是坏人-（客人尖叫）
-It's the Bad Guys! -(guests screaming)

623
00:26:51,482 --> 00:26:52,650
逮捕他们！
Arrest them!

624
00:26:52,784 --> 00:26:53,550
警察：小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，
OFFICERS: Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,

625
00:26:53,685 --> 00:26:54,919
小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，
hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,

626
00:26:55,052 --> 00:26:56,888
小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋，小屋.
hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut.

627
00:26:57,021 --> 00:26:58,122
（警察咆哮）
(officers growl)

628
00:26:58,255 --> 00:26:59,556
他们偷走了金海豚！
They stole the Golden Dolphin!

629
00:26:59,691 --> 00:27:02,526
拜托，你不能证明这一点.
Come on, you can't prove that.

630
00:27:04,461 --> 00:27:06,330
（高音）：我的宝贝！
(high-pitched voice): My baby!

631
00:27:06,463 --> 00:27:07,999
-跪下，坏蛋-（指关节裂开）
-On your knees, Bad Guys. -(knuckles crack)

632
00:27:08,132 --> 00:27:09,233
举起手来.
With your hands up.

633
00:27:09,366 --> 00:27:11,402
从不我们要走了.
Never! We're out of here.

634
00:27:14,138 --> 00:27:16,373
再见，笨蛋.
So long, suckers.

635
00:27:22,513 --> 00:27:25,216
这有点奇怪.
Well, this just got a little weird.

636
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:27,218
（警报声）
(siren whooping)

637
00:27:27,351 --> 00:27:29,020
蒂芙尼：坏人破产了.
TIFFANY: The Bad Guys go bust.

638
00:27:29,153 --> 00:27:32,156
邪恶的五人组终于被抓获了.
The nefarious fivesome has finally been captured.

639
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:34,926
我Tiffany Fluffit是第一个到场的.
And I, Tiffany Fluffit, am first on the scene.

640
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:37,729
哇！我刚刚意识到我
Wow. You know, I-I just realized that I have devoted

641
00:27:37,862 --> 00:27:40,331
我的整个成年生活都是为了把你关进监狱.
my entire adult life to putting you in jail.

642
00:27:40,464 --> 00:27:42,066
你是我的目标.
You are my purpose.

643
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:43,968
没有你，我是谁？
Without you, who am I?

644
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:45,402
我只是开玩笑.
Ah, I'm just kidding.

645
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,204
这是我一生中最美好的时刻！
This is the best moment of my life!

646
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:48,372
-（啪）-（狼呜咽）
-(smack) -(Wolf whimpers)

647
00:27:48,505 --> 00:27:51,175
这是坏人的末日.
It's the end of the Bad Guys.

648
00:27:51,308 --> 00:27:52,609
不
No!

649
00:27:52,744 --> 00:27:54,645
把手拿开！（尖叫声）
Get your hands off of me! (screams)

650
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,148
哦，你现在求我咬你一口.
Ooh, you're begging for a biting right now.

651
00:27:57,281 --> 00:27:58,682
狼
Wolf!

652
00:28:01,986 --> 00:28:03,721
蒂芬妮：果酱教授！州长女士！
TIFFANY: Professor Marmalade! Madam Governor!

653
00:28:03,855 --> 00:28:05,589
哦，果酱教授！州长女士！
Ooh, Professor Marmalade! Madam Governor!

654
00:28:05,723 --> 00:28:07,825
-州长女士-一次一个.一次一个.
-Madam Governor! -One at a time. One at a time.

655
00:28:10,394 --> 00:28:11,628
-嘿.嘿-打扰一下
-Hey. Hey! -Excuse me.

656
00:28:11,763 --> 00:28:13,597
-（人们屏住呼吸）-抱歉打断一下.
-(people gasp) -Sorry to interrupt.

657
00:28:13,731 --> 00:28:16,433
我只是想祝贺这里的州长.
I just wanted to congratulate the governor here.

658
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:19,036
我得说，你真的让我们陷入困境.
I got to say, you really got us pegged.

659
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:23,407
我们只是一口充满愤怒和自我厌恶的深井.
We're just a deep well of anger and self-loathing.

660
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,376
-否认-当然那也是.
-Denial. -Sure. That, too.

661
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:26,577
-自恋-是 啊是 啊
-Narcissism. -Yeah. Yeah.

662
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,879
情感空虚.
Emotional emptiness.

663
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:29,413
-所以我们在同一页上-隐马尔可夫模型.
-So we're on the same page. -Hmm.

664
00:28:29,546 --> 00:28:31,515
他在干什么？
What is he doing?

665
00:28:31,648 --> 00:28:34,685
遗憾的是，我们从来没有机会
Sadly, we were never given a chance

666
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:38,289
比二流罪犯还要厉害.
to be anything more than second-rate criminals.

667
00:28:38,422 --> 00:28:40,892
要是有人能帮忙就好了
If only there was someone who could help

668
00:28:41,025 --> 00:28:44,561
我们内心善良的花朵盛开.
the flower of goodness inside us blossom.

669
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:46,964
爱与宽恕的象征，
Some icon of love and forgiveness,

670
00:28:47,098 --> 00:28:50,401
比如，呃，我不知道，特蕾莎修女.
like, uh, I don't know, Mother Teresa.

671
00:28:50,534 --> 00:28:53,470
最好的办法就是把我们关进监狱
Best thing is to just throw us in jail

672
00:28:53,604 --> 00:28:56,107
在我们绝望的余生里.
for the rest of our hopeless lives.

673
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,909
是的，这就是计划.
Yeah, that's the plan.

674
00:28:58,042 --> 00:28:59,676
-等等，等等，等等，不，不
-Wait, wait, wait, no, no. -(grunting)

675
00:28:59,811 --> 00:29:01,378
-进去-噢
-Get in there. -Ow!

676
00:29:01,512 --> 00:29:03,447
果酱：等等.
MARMALADE: Wait.

677
00:29:04,248 --> 00:29:05,482
求你了...请再说一遍？
Uh, beg... beg pardon?

678
00:29:05,616 --> 00:29:07,518
沃尔夫先生可能是一头凶猛的野兽.
Mr. Wolf may be a savage beast.

679
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:09,186
基本上是步行垃圾.
Basically walking garbage.

680
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,654
抱歉，我想说的是.
Sorry, I'm making a point.

681
00:29:10,788 --> 00:29:12,389
做你该做的，伙计.
Do what you need to do, pal.

682
00:29:12,523 --> 00:29:14,558
但我们怎么能说他们没有希望呢
But how can we say they're hopeless

683
00:29:14,691 --> 00:29:16,894
如果他们从来没有机会？
if they've never been given a chance?

684
00:29:17,028 --> 00:29:19,997
如果…怎么办...如果我们做个小实验呢，黛安？
What if... what if we tried a little experiment, Diane?

685
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:22,633
如你所知，我为上帝举办的晚会，
As you know, my Gala for Goodness,

686
00:29:22,766 --> 00:29:26,470
“年度最佳慈善活动”即将揭晓.
the "hashtag charity event of the year," is coming up.

687
00:29:26,603 --> 00:29:28,339
如果我能在晚会上向大家证明
If I can prove to everyone at that gala

688
00:29:28,472 --> 00:29:29,874
坏人变了，
that the Bad Guys have changed,

689
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:32,509
你会让他们自由，给他们一个干净的开始吗？
will you set them free and give them a clean start?

690
00:29:32,643 --> 00:29:33,945
（人群喘息、低语）
(crowd gasping, murmuring)

691
00:29:34,078 --> 00:29:36,147
-什么？果酱教授-狼：噢！
-What? Professor Marmalade! -WOLF: Ow!

692
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,515
不不你没看到他在干什么吗？
No, no, no, no, no. Don't you see what he's doing?

693
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:40,151
他在耍你.
He's playing you.

694
00:29:40,284 --> 00:29:41,352
但这是我的主意.
But it was my idea.

695
00:29:41,485 --> 00:29:42,619
这是他的主意.
It was his idea.

696
00:29:42,753 --> 00:29:44,621
但只是因为你让他得到了它.
But only because you made him have it.

697
00:29:44,755 --> 00:29:46,958
州长夫人，你不能让他们走.
Madam Governor, you can't just let them go.

698
00:29:47,091 --> 00:29:49,360
教授，我不会为了城市的安全
Professor, I'm not about to put the safety of the city

699
00:29:49,493 --> 00:29:51,428
正在排队做实验.
on the line for an experiment.

700
00:29:51,562 --> 00:29:53,064
对不起，州长女士.
Excuse me, Madam Governor.

701
00:29:53,197 --> 00:29:56,800
我似乎记得一位智者曾经说过，
I seem to remember that a wise person once said,

702
00:29:56,934 --> 00:30:01,138
“即使是垃圾也可以被回收成美丽的东西.”
"Even trash can be recycled into something beautiful."

703
00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:03,875
（轻声笑）
(chuckles softly)

704
00:30:04,775 --> 00:30:06,077
可以我很高兴.
Okay. I'm game.

705
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,745
只是因为是你，教授.
But only because it's you, Professor.

706
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,981
不
No!

707
00:30:10,114 --> 00:30:12,183
我们会抓住海豚直到晚会.
We'll hold on to the Dolphin until the gala.

708
00:30:12,316 --> 00:30:15,586
只是为了消除任何不必要的诱惑.
Just to remove any unnecessary temptation.

709
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:17,754
当然好主意.
Of course. Good thinking.

710
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:19,823
这就是为什么你是州长.
That's why you're governor.

711
00:30:19,957 --> 00:30:22,226
现在大家都很开心...
Now that everyone's happy...

712
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,694
不开心.
Not happy.

713
00:30:23,827 --> 00:30:26,330
...一、 Rupert Marmalade第四，
...I, Rupert Marmalade the Fourth,

714
00:30:26,463 --> 00:30:28,399
会把坏人变成...
will turn the Bad Guys into...

715
00:30:28,532 --> 00:30:30,267
-好人-（摄像机咔嗒声）
-the Good Guys! -(cameras clicking)

716
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:32,870
（人们喘着粗气）
(people gasping)

717
00:30:34,872 --> 00:30:37,141
我想这些是你的.
I think these belong to you.

718
00:30:37,274 --> 00:30:38,675
嘿
Hey.

719
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:42,413
黛安：不是每个人都有第二次机会.
DIANE: Not everyone gets a second chance.

720
00:30:42,546 --> 00:30:46,617
充分利用它，普德尔顿先生.
Make the most of it, Mr. Poodleton.

721
00:30:50,321 --> 00:30:51,655
（发动机起动）
(engine starts)

722
00:30:51,788 --> 00:30:54,025
（警报声哀鸣）
(sirens wailing)

723
00:30:55,126 --> 00:30:57,328
-蛇：狼？
-(chuckles) -SNAKE: Wolf?

724
00:30:57,461 --> 00:30:58,629
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

725
00:30:58,762 --> 00:31:00,197
-狼：什么-其他人：是的.
-WOLF: What? -OTHERS: Yeah.

726
00:31:00,331 --> 00:31:02,266
哦，那个.（咯咯笑）
Oh, that. (chuckles)

727
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,102
对不起.我觉得这很明显.
I-I-I'm sorry. I thought it was, uh, obvious.

728
00:31:05,236 --> 00:31:07,271
我们会顺利的.
We're gonna go good.

729
00:31:08,472 --> 00:31:10,174
你完全失去了我.
Uh, you totally lost me.

730
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:12,409
我告诉他不要在厕所外喝酒.
I told him to stop drinking out of the toilet.

731
00:31:12,543 --> 00:31:14,478
嘿，你的头被击中了吗？
Hey, did you get hit on the head?

732
00:31:14,611 --> 00:31:15,846
什么不，我的头没有被击中.
What? No, I didn't get hit on the head.

733
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,548
我表弟的头被锚击中了，
My cousin got hit on the head with an anchor,

734
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:19,316
在那之后，他只游了一圈.
and after that, he only swam in a circle.

735
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,518
狼：不，不，哥们，哥们，你们没跟着我.
WOLF: No, no, g-guys, guys, you're not following me.

736
00:31:21,652 --> 00:31:24,555
我们要假装一切顺利.
We're gonna pretend to go good.

737
00:31:24,688 --> 00:31:26,223
就几天吃果酱.
Just a few days with Marmalade.

738
00:31:26,357 --> 00:31:30,361
然后我们以好人的身份参加晚会
And then we roll into the gala as Good Guys

739
00:31:30,494 --> 00:31:33,697
推出苏格兰免费的...
and roll out scot-free with...

740
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,633
所有人：金色海豚.
ALL: The Golden Dolphin.

741
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:37,901
你明白了.
You got it.

742
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:40,171
我们什么时候才能完成一项工作？
Since when do we not finish a job?

743
00:31:40,304 --> 00:31:43,574
坏人变成好人
The Bad Guys become the Good Guys

744
00:31:43,707 --> 00:31:46,843
所以我们可以留下来对付坏人.
so we can stay the Bad Guys.

745
00:31:46,978 --> 00:31:49,413
-你知道我在说什么吗-（笑声）
-You know what I'm saying? -(laughter)

746
00:31:49,546 --> 00:31:50,948
坏人表现得好吗？
Bad Guys acting good?

747
00:31:51,082 --> 00:31:52,783
这是最坏的家伙.
It's the ultimate Bad Guy thing.

748
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:54,218
太棒了.
It's fantastic.

749
00:31:54,351 --> 00:31:55,652
沃尔夫，你是个天才.
Wolf, you're a genius.

750
00:31:55,786 --> 00:31:57,221
（笑声继续）
(laughter continues)

751
00:31:57,354 --> 00:31:59,690
这将是有史以来最轻松的骗局，
It's gonna be, like, the most relaxing con ever,

752
00:31:59,823 --> 00:32:01,292
就像度假一样.
like a vacation.

753
00:32:01,425 --> 00:32:03,660
哦，哦.一场辩论.
Oh, oh. A con-cation.

754
00:32:03,794 --> 00:32:05,429
（笑声）
(laughter)

755
00:32:05,562 --> 00:32:09,233
鲨鱼：哦！我父母是在一次会议上认识的.
SHARK: Ooh! My parents met on a con-cation.

756
00:32:11,268 --> 00:32:13,137
（海鸥呱呱叫）
(seagulls squawking)

757
00:32:15,706 --> 00:32:17,374
（橘子酱嗡嗡作响）
(Marmalade humming)

758
00:32:21,812 --> 00:32:23,180
（门铃响了）
(doorbell rings)

759
00:32:23,314 --> 00:32:24,481
哦，太好了.
Oh, goody.

760
00:32:24,615 --> 00:32:26,050
狼（咯咯笑）：哇.
WOLF (chuckling): Wow.

761
00:32:26,183 --> 00:32:27,651
又大又漂亮.
Big and fancy.

762
00:32:27,784 --> 00:32:29,953
啮齿动物有味道.可以
Rodent's got taste. Okay.

763
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:32,856
呵呵.几乎让我想变得可爱.
Huh. Almost makes me want to be cute.

764
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,360
果酱：他们说经验是最好的老师.
MARMALADE: They say experience is the best teacher.

765
00:32:36,493 --> 00:32:38,195
他们错了.
And they are wrong.

766
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:39,563
我是.
I am.

767
00:32:39,696 --> 00:32:41,898
早上好，善良的学生们.
Good morning, students of goodness.

768
00:32:42,033 --> 00:32:47,171
欢迎来到你余生最美好的第一天.
And welcome to the first day of the rest of your best life.

769
00:32:47,304 --> 00:32:48,505
一个巨大的屁股.
A giant butt.

770
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:49,840
嗯？
Huh?

771
00:32:49,973 --> 00:32:51,475
不是屁股.
Uh, it's-it's not a butt.

772
00:32:51,608 --> 00:32:54,111
这是一盏灯的形状
It's a lamp in the shape of

773
00:32:54,245 --> 00:32:56,380
爱陨石坑陨石，我最伟大的...
the Love Crater Meteorite, my greatest...

774
00:32:56,513 --> 00:32:58,449
-我想知道这是谁的屁股-（鲨鱼喘息）-狼：嗯...
-I wonder whose butt it is. -(Shark gasps) -WOLF: Uh...

775
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,252
再一次，它不是屁股.非常感谢.
Once again, it's not a butt. Thank you.

776
00:33:01,385 --> 00:33:03,254
这是一颗心.现在，正如我所说...
It's a heart. Now, as I was saying...

777
00:33:03,387 --> 00:33:05,656
-那它为什么有脸颊-（嘘）-闭嘴！
-Then why does it have cheeks? -(shushing) -Shut it!

778
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:07,524
什么我从没见过有双颊的心.
What? I've never seen a heart with cheeks.

779
00:33:07,658 --> 00:33:09,126
（嘲笑）这不是...
(scoffs) It's not a...

780
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,628
-战利品-不是屁股！不是屁股！
-Booty! -It's not a butt! Not a butt!

781
00:33:11,762 --> 00:33:14,198
他知道屁股是什么吗？
Does he know what a butt is?

782
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:16,067
（清了清嗓子）正如我刚才所说，
(clears throat) As I was saying,

783
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,036
在外面，你们五个是反派，
on the outside, the five of you are villains,

784
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,138
捕食者，无情的反社会者.
predators, remorseless sociopaths.

785
00:33:21,272 --> 00:33:23,340
哦，别说了.你让我脸红了.
Oh, stop. You're making me blush.

786
00:33:23,474 --> 00:33:25,209
但里面有一朵花--
But inside, there's a flower--

787
00:33:25,342 --> 00:33:28,179
善良之花——当它绽放的时候
the flower of goodness-- and when it blooms

788
00:33:28,312 --> 00:33:30,714
你会感觉到那种积极的刺激
and you feel that tingle of positivity

789
00:33:30,847 --> 00:33:32,349
辐射穿过你的身体，
radiating through your body,

790
00:33:32,483 --> 00:33:35,552
你会想一直感受到的.
you're going to want to feel it all the time.

791
00:33:35,686 --> 00:33:37,354
所以我们要去刺激一下？
So we're going for a tingle?

792
00:33:37,488 --> 00:33:38,689
没有刺痛感.
Not any tingle.

793
00:33:38,822 --> 00:33:40,924
善良的刺痛，你会感觉到
The tingle of goodness, which you'll feel

794
00:33:41,058 --> 00:33:44,295
在我最先进的共享实验室里.
in my state-of-the-art Sharing Laboratory.

795
00:33:44,428 --> 00:33:48,332
好的，斯内克先生，我来推你一下.
Okay, Mr. Snake, I'm going to give you a Push Pop.

796
00:33:48,465 --> 00:33:50,901
太棒了帮我推一下！
Great! Push Pop just for me!

797
00:33:51,034 --> 00:33:53,637
-不，分享-为什么？
-No, to share. -Why?

798
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,639
从根本上说，
Well, on a fundamental level,

799
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:57,741
这是为了满足别人的需求
it's about putting someone else's needs

800
00:33:57,874 --> 00:34:00,211
-领先于你自己-（咯咯笑）
-ahead of your own. -(chuckling)

801
00:34:00,344 --> 00:34:02,079
哦，不，不可能.
Oh, no. No way.

802
00:34:02,213 --> 00:34:03,947
蛇
Snake.

803
00:34:04,081 --> 00:34:06,683
（呻吟）好吧，好吧.
(groans) All right, all right.

804
00:34:06,817 --> 00:34:08,685
这味道会特别甜，
This is going to taste extra sweet,

805
00:34:08,819 --> 00:34:11,322
因为我知道你有多想要它.
'cause I know how bad you want it.

806
00:34:11,455 --> 00:34:13,757
（呻吟）
(groaning)

807
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,726
请给我开门.啊...
Pop me, please. Ah...

808
00:34:15,859 --> 00:34:18,095
（呻吟）
(groaning)

809
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,465
不.笨蛋.
Nope. Sucker.

810
00:34:21,598 --> 00:34:22,699
-就这样-（喘息）
-That's it! -(gasps)

811
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:24,601
-我会教你分享-（尖叫声）
-I'll teach you to share! -(screams)

812
00:34:24,735 --> 00:34:25,902
（喘息）
(all gasp)

813
00:34:26,036 --> 00:34:28,038
我喜欢分享.很好吃.嗯.
Mm, I like sharing. It's yummy. Mm.

814
00:34:28,172 --> 00:34:29,873
蛇（回声）：完全值得.
SNAKE (echoing): Totally worth it.

815
00:34:30,006 --> 00:34:32,109
太可怕了.
Well, that's terrifying.

816
00:34:32,243 --> 00:34:34,178
让我们试试更简单的.
Let's try something simpler.

817
00:34:34,311 --> 00:34:36,713
一个好人总是注意的
A good person always pays attention

818
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:38,182
满足他人的需求.
to the needs of others.

819
00:34:38,315 --> 00:34:40,851
现在，这里有一位慈祥体弱的奶奶.
Now, here's a kindly, frail grandma.

820
00:34:40,984 --> 00:34:42,853
（其他人大笑）
(others laughing)

821
00:34:42,986 --> 00:34:46,323
食人鱼先生，帮奶奶过马路.
Mr. Piranha, help grandma across the street.

822
00:34:46,457 --> 00:34:49,226
（嘲笑）当然，当然，当然.我一直都这么做.
(scoffs) Sure, sure, sure. I do this all the time.

823
00:34:50,026 --> 00:34:52,829
-给你，女士-（其他人大笑）
-Here you go, ma'am. -(others laughing)

824
00:34:52,963 --> 00:34:54,798
他肯定会搞砸的.
Oh, he is totally gonna blow it.

825
00:34:54,931 --> 00:34:56,333
那是什么？你说什么
What was that? What did you say

826
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:57,934
-你觉得我做不到-（狼蛛笑）
-You think I can't do this? -(Tarantula laughing)

827
00:34:58,068 --> 00:35:00,371
-不，不，不，食人鱼-（卡车喇叭鸣响）
-No, no, no, Piranha! -(truck horn blares)

828
00:35:00,504 --> 00:35:03,307
（狼尖叫、呻吟）
(Wolf screams, groans)

829
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,309
也许更简单？
Maybe simpler?

830
00:35:05,442 --> 00:35:07,378
（猫喵喵叫）
(cat meowing)

831
00:35:07,511 --> 00:35:10,281
嘿，看.这是一只卡在树上的猫.
Hey, look. It's a cat stuck in a tree.

832
00:35:10,414 --> 00:35:12,416
再简单不过了.
It doesn't get much simpler than that.

833
00:35:12,549 --> 00:35:14,451
那么，在这种情况下呢
Now, what in this scenario

834
00:35:14,585 --> 00:35:16,487
会让你感到刺痛吗？
would give you that good tingle?

835
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,088
吃了吗？
Eating it?

836
00:35:18,222 --> 00:35:20,357
这就是为什么我总是随身携带两片面包.
This is why I always carry two pieces of bread with me.

837
00:35:20,491 --> 00:35:21,525
不
No.

838
00:35:21,658 --> 00:35:24,395
我想让你...
I want you to s...

839
00:35:24,528 --> 00:35:25,662
-打它-剥皮？
-Smack it. -Skin it?

840
00:35:25,796 --> 00:35:27,431
-刺伤它-煎一下-唱给它听？
-Stab it. -Sauté it. -Sing to it?

841
00:35:27,564 --> 00:35:29,333
省省吧.我要你说...
Save it. I want you to sa...

842
00:35:29,466 --> 00:35:31,602
这很明显...太明显了...我要你保存它.
That's obv... It's so obvi... I want you to save it.

843
00:35:31,735 --> 00:35:33,003
大家：哦！
ALL: Oh!

844
00:35:33,136 --> 00:35:34,905
-对，对-对，对，对.当然
-Right, right. -Right, right, right. Sure.

845
00:35:35,906 --> 00:35:38,475
-来，凯蒂，凯蒂，凯蒂-（咆哮）
-Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. -(growling)

846
00:35:38,609 --> 00:35:39,743
（喵喵）
(meows)

847
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:41,545
哇，那只猫显然有缺陷.
Whoa, that cat is obviously defective.

848
00:35:41,678 --> 00:35:42,846
你怎么了？
What is wrong with you?

849
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:44,515
你会让它心脏病发作.
You're gonna give it a heart attack.

850
00:35:44,648 --> 00:35:46,317
（嘲笑）我来处理.
(scoffs) I'll handle this.

851
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,420
-怎么了，爸爸-（嚎叫）
-What's up, papa! -(yowls)

852
00:35:49,553 --> 00:35:50,921
（狼咕噜）
(Wolf grunts)

853
00:35:51,054 --> 00:35:53,357
（尖叫）把他从我脸上弄下来！他在我脸上！
(screams) Get him off my face! He's on my face!

854
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,659
不，不，不，不，不，听着！你在干什么？
No, no, no, no, no, listen! Wh-What are you doing?

855
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:56,893
（猫叫）
(cat yowling)

856
00:35:57,027 --> 00:35:58,995
（狼呻吟）
(Wolf groans)

857
00:36:00,464 --> 00:36:04,000
可以请问你擅长什么？
Okay. What, may I ask, are you good at?

858
00:36:04,134 --> 00:36:05,636
偷东西.
Stealing stuff.

859
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:06,837
哦，是的，我们很擅长.
Oh, yeah, we're great at that.

860
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:07,938
-抢劫-盗窃罪.
-Robbery. -Larceny.

861
00:36:08,071 --> 00:36:09,139
-电报诈骗-勒索.

862
00:36:09,273 --> 00:36:10,641
-逃税-抢劫.
-Tax evasion. -Heists.

863
00:36:10,774 --> 00:36:12,509
-狼蛛：邮件诈骗-等待你说是抢劫？
-TARANTULA: Mail fraud. -Wait. Heists, you say?

864
00:36:12,643 --> 00:36:14,978
那是...是的，这是我们的特色菜.
Well, that's... yeah, that's kind of our specialty.

865
00:36:15,111 --> 00:36:17,581
我可能有个主意.
I might just have an idea.

866
00:36:17,714 --> 00:36:20,951
（吟诵）：解放猪！放了猪！
(chanting): Free the pigs! Free the pigs!

867
00:36:21,084 --> 00:36:23,787
那是一个动物测试实验室.
That is an animal testing lab.

868
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,357
20万只无助的豚鼠，
Within, 200,000 helpless guinea pigs,

869
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:30,494
所有这些都被虐待狂科学家戳戳戳.
all being poked and prodded by sadistic scientists.

870
00:36:30,627 --> 00:36:31,895
你说豚鼠？
Guinea pigs, you say?

871
00:36:32,028 --> 00:36:33,497
蛇
Snake.

872
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,898
我要你去救他们.
I want you to rescue them.

873
00:36:35,031 --> 00:36:37,033
但这是一次永久的抢劫，
But this is a heist for good,

874
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:40,537
所以我带了更友好的衣服给你穿.
so I brought something more friendly for you to wear.

875
00:36:40,671 --> 00:36:42,839
-（轮胎吱吱声）-再见.
-(tires squeal) -Bye.

876
00:36:42,973 --> 00:36:44,741
好吧，我们的街头信誉就这样消失了.
Well, there goes our street cred.

877
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:46,543
至少很舒服.
At least it's comfy.

878
00:36:48,178 --> 00:36:51,014
沃尔夫：好吧，我们需要转移那个科学家的注意力.
WOLF: All right, we need to distract that scientist.

879
00:36:51,147 --> 00:36:53,116
-Shark，你起来了-收到.
-Shark, you're up. -Copy that.

880
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,352
可以我们需要一根绳子和一个钩子.
Okay. We're gonna need a rope and a hook.

881
00:36:55,486 --> 00:36:57,053
-我有这个-其他人：什么？
-I got this one. -OTHERS: What?

882
00:36:57,187 --> 00:36:58,322
你是志愿者吗？
You're volunteering?

883
00:36:58,455 --> 00:37:00,023
你从来没有自愿做过任何事.
You've never volunteered for anything.

884
00:37:00,156 --> 00:37:01,825
当然有.马上
Sure, I did. Right now.

885
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:04,094
-呃-把我扔上去.吉迪亚普！
-Uh... -Throw me up there. Giddyap!

-Really? -Yep.

887
00:37:05,729 --> 00:37:07,264
我99%相信你能做到.
I'm 99% sure you can make it.

888
00:37:07,398 --> 00:37:09,165
-好的-来吧！
-Okay. -Let's do it!

889
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:11,568
嘿，儿子.
Hey there, son.

890
00:37:11,702 --> 00:37:12,769
爸爸
Dad?

891
00:37:12,903 --> 00:37:14,471
我知道你有一份重要的工作，
I know you've got an important job,

892
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:17,007
但我希望你还有时间跟你老爸聊聊.
but I hope you still have time for a catch with your old man.

893
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,509
-（喘息）-（蛇呻吟）
-(gasps) -(Snake groans)

894

-嘿，孩子-嗯-96%确定.
-Hey, kiddo. -Huh? -SNAKE: 96% sure.

895
00:37:20,411 --> 00:37:22,078
你永远是我特别的男孩.
You'll always be my special boy.

896
00:37:22,212 --> 00:37:23,614
-啊-（蛇呻吟）
-Aw. -(Snake groans)

897
00:37:23,747 --> 00:37:25,181
大概90%.
SNAKE: Maybe 90%.

898
00:37:25,316 --> 00:37:27,651
我一生都在等待这一刻.
I've been waiting my entire life for this moment.

899
00:37:27,784 --> 00:37:29,953
-蛇（呻吟）：我不知道-可以现在，继续.
-SNAKE (groans): I don't know. -Okay. Now, go long.

900
00:37:30,086 --> 00:37:31,655
哦，孩子，哦，孩子，哦，孩子！
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

901
00:37:31,788 --> 00:37:34,791
谢谢你，爸爸！（笑）
Thank you, Daddy! (laughs)

902
00:37:34,925 --> 00:37:37,328
（呻吟）50...今天是星期几？
(groans) 50... What day is it?

903
00:37:37,461 --> 00:37:38,595
我是谁？
Who am I?

904
00:37:38,729 --> 00:37:40,331
果酱：对.豚鼠被锁上了
MARMALADE: Right. The guinea pigs are locked

905
00:37:40,464 --> 00:37:42,333
在一扇三英尺厚的钢门后面.
behind a three-foot-thick steel door.

906
00:37:42,466 --> 00:37:44,535
只有通过通风口才能进去.
The only way in is through the vents.

907
00:37:44,668 --> 00:37:46,236
我得到了它.
I got it.

908
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,238
Upsy daisy.*通过过滤器和通风口*
Upsy-daisy. * Over the filters and through the vents *

909
00:37:48,372 --> 00:37:50,073
我从未见过他如此爽朗.
I have never seen him so chipper.

910
00:37:50,206 --> 00:37:51,908
他一直在冥想吗？
Has he been meditating?

911
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:54,511
*到天竺鼠之地我们*
* To Guinea Pig Land we... *

912

哦
Oh.

916
00:38:02,118 --> 00:38:04,488
（耳语）：蛇攻击.
(whispers): Snake attack.

917
00:38:05,288 --> 00:38:07,157
哦嘿，看，我是Marmalade教授.
Oh. Hey, look, it's Professor Marmalade.

918
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,593
是的，没错.是我.
Yes, that's right. It's me.

919
00:38:09,726 --> 00:38:11,061
救援已经到来.
Help has arrived.

920
00:38:11,194 --> 00:38:13,397
把你的眼睛盯着那扇门.
Just keep your eyes glued to that door.

921
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,500
蛇来吧，蛇.开门.
Snake. Come on, Snake. Open up.

922
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:17,834
放松
Relax.

923
00:38:17,968 --> 00:38:20,103
这些门很复杂.
These doors are complicated.

924
00:38:20,236 --> 00:38:22,005
-狼蛛：你在开玩笑吗-（咯咯笑）
-TARANTULA: Are you kidding me? -(chuckles)

925
00:38:22,138 --> 00:38:23,407
你以为你在干什么？
What do you think you're doing?

926
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,241
我们应该拯救它们，而不是吃掉它们.
We're supposed to save them, not eat them.

927
00:38:25,376 --> 00:38:27,878
我得说他们去了一个更好的地方.
Well, I'd say they've gone to a better place.

928
00:38:28,011 --> 00:38:29,145
（打嗝，咯咯笑）
(belches, chuckles)

929
00:38:29,279 --> 00:38:30,347
好了，就这样.
All right, that's it.

930
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:31,982
-吐出来-嘿
-Spit them out. -Hey.

931
00:38:32,115 --> 00:38:33,684
嘿！
(yells) Hey!

932
00:38:33,817 --> 00:38:35,352
不管你喜不喜欢我们都会救你的.
We gonna save you whether you like it or not.

933
00:38:35,486 --> 00:38:37,020
我们在救你，你们这些蠢货.
We're saving you, you stupid hair balls.

934
00:38:37,153 --> 00:38:39,390
不是那扇门.另一扇门.
Not that door. The other door.

935
00:38:40,256 --> 00:38:41,358
嘿，嘿.（咕哝）
Hey, hey. (grunts)

936
00:38:41,492 --> 00:38:42,359
哇！
Whoa!

937
00:38:42,493 --> 00:38:43,627
随时可以.
Any second.

938
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,795
（喘息）

-（豚鼠尖叫）-（咕噜声）
-(guinea pigs squeaking) -(grunts)

941
00:38:49,232 --> 00:38:51,368
（人们喘着粗气）
(people gasping)

942
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,839
这不是它看起来的样子.
It-it's not what it looks like.

943
00:38:55,972 --> 00:38:58,208
（警报声）
(alarm blaring)

944
00:38:59,142 --> 00:39:01,011
（豚鼠尖叫声）
(guinea pig squeaks)

945
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:05,682
黛安：侵入、入室盗窃、混乱，
DIANE: Trespassing, burglary, mayhem,

946
00:39:05,816 --> 00:39:07,951
用致命的爬行动物袭击？
assault with a deadly reptile?

947
00:39:08,084 --> 00:39:09,586
好像那些可怜的啮齿动物
As if those poor rodents

948
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,588
经历的还不够.
haven't been through enough already.

949
00:39:11,722 --> 00:39:12,856
不，黛安，求你了.
No, Diane, please.

950
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:14,558
（叹息）好的.
(sighs) Okay.

951
00:39:14,691 --> 00:39:17,528
对不起，教授，我要给主任打电话.
I'm sorry, Professor, but I'm calling the chief.

952
00:39:17,661 --> 00:39:18,495
请来吧
Please. Come on.

953
00:39:18,629 --> 00:39:19,896
黛安：这个实验结束了.
DIANE: This experiment is over.

954
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,931
果酱：实验需要时间.
MARMALADE: Experiments take time.

955
00:39:21,064 --> 00:39:22,265
你忍不住？
You couldn't help yourself?

956
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:23,700
所以我有点软弱.起诉我.
So I had a moment of weakness. Sue me.

957
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:25,536
这在监狱里很难做到.
That's gonna be difficult to do from prison.

958
00:39:25,669 --> 00:39:27,804
伙计们，我们现在该怎么办？
Guys, what do we do now?

959
00:39:29,506 --> 00:39:33,109
是时候发起魅力攻势了.
Hmm. Time to launch a charm offensive.

960
00:39:33,243 --> 00:39:36,747
哦，是的.完整的克鲁尼.
Oh, yeah. The full Clooney.

961
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,682
总督女士.
Madam Governor.

962
00:39:38,815 --> 00:39:39,783
黛安.
Diane.

963
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:41,418
别耍我，狼.
Do not Clooney me, Wolf.

964
00:39:41,552 --> 00:39:43,754
哦，我明白了.你觉得我还是个坏人，
Oh, I see what's going on. You think I'm still a Bad Guy,

965
00:39:43,887 --> 00:39:46,122
试图欺骗我的自由之路.
trying to bamboozle my way to freedom.

966
00:39:46,256 --> 00:39:47,758
但我们变了.
But we've changed.

967
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:50,226
善良之花正在遍地开花.
That flower of goodness is blossoming all over the place.

968
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,063
（叹气）你不厌倦撒谎吗？
(sighs) Don't you ever get tired of lying?

969
00:39:53,196 --> 00:39:54,731
（咯咯笑）：不.
(chuckling): No.

970
00:39:54,865 --> 00:39:56,099
我是说...（结结巴巴地）软糖.
I mean... (stammers) Fudge.

971
00:39:56,232 --> 00:39:57,734
那是...那是个诡计问题，对吧？
That was... that was a trick question, right?

972
00:39:57,868 --> 00:40:00,771
（叹息）我给了你一个机会--
(sighs) I gave you an opportunity--

973
00:40:00,904 --> 00:40:02,305
向全世界展示的机会
a chance to show the world

974
00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:04,608
你不仅仅是一个可怕的刻板印象--
that you're more than just a scary stereotype--

975
00:40:04,741 --> 00:40:06,543
但你太骄傲了
but you're too proud

976
00:40:06,677 --> 00:40:09,145
或者太没勇气利用它.
or too gutless to take advantage of it.

977
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:11,047
胆小鬼？我没有勇气？
Gutless? I'm gutless?

978
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:12,282
（笑）：哦.
(chuckles): Oh.

979
00:40:12,415 --> 00:40:13,817
对不起，我们见过面吗？
I'm sorry, have we met?

980
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,285
我是每个故事的反派.
I'm the villain of every story.

981
00:40:15,418 --> 00:40:16,653
在被证明无罪之前是有罪的.
Guilty until proven innocent.

982
00:40:16,787 --> 00:40:19,890
即使我们奇迹般地改变了，
Even if by some miracle we did change,

983
00:40:20,023 --> 00:40:21,725
谁会相信我们？
who's gonna believe us, huh?

984
00:40:21,858 --> 00:40:23,660
你当然不知道这件事，
Of course you wouldn't know anything about that,

985
00:40:23,794 --> 00:40:27,664
穿上你的完美女装.
with your Little Miss Perfect power suits.

986
00:40:28,665 --> 00:40:29,866
是这样吗？
Is that so?

987
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,468
等等.
Wait a second.

988
00:40:31,602 --> 00:40:33,269
你做了什么...你怎么...
What did... How did you...

989
00:40:33,403 --> 00:40:37,641
狼和狐狸没什么不同.
A wolf and a fox are not so different.

990
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:40,777
也许他们会相信你，也许他们不会，
Maybe they will believe you, maybe they won't,

991
00:40:40,911 --> 00:40:42,278
但这无关紧要.
but it doesn't matter.

992
00:40:42,412 --> 00:40:44,715
不要为他们这么做.为你做吧.
Don't do it for them. Do it for you.

993
00:40:44,848 --> 00:40:47,350
这是一个写自己故事的机会.
This is a chance to write your own story.

994
00:40:47,484 --> 00:40:50,453
为你和你的朋友找到更好的生活.
To find a better life for you and your friends.

995
00:40:51,254 --> 00:40:53,023
拜托，你会失去什么？
Come on, what have you got to lose?

996
00:40:53,156 --> 00:40:55,125
我不知道.我的尊严？
I don't know. My dignity?

997
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:59,696
是的，那艘船已经开航了.
Yeah, well, that ship has already sailed.

998
00:41:05,669 --> 00:41:08,471
信不信由你，我支持你，沃尔夫.
Believe it or not, I'm rooting for you, Wolf.

999
00:41:09,272 --> 00:41:11,441
你不给局长打电话了？
So you're not gonna call the chief?

1000
00:41:12,242 --> 00:41:15,145
-晚会上见-（发动机起动）
-I'll see you at the gala. -(engine starts)

1001
00:41:33,063 --> 00:41:34,765
（猫在远处喵喵叫）
(cat meows in distance)

1002
00:41:36,232 --> 00:41:38,769
（喵喵继续）
(meowing continues)

1003
00:41:48,111 --> 00:41:49,780
（喵喵）
(meows)

1004
00:41:49,913 --> 00:41:52,282
我想我们的开始不太好.
I think we got off to a bad start.

1005
00:41:52,415 --> 00:41:54,417
名字叫沃尔夫.
The name's Wolf.

1006
00:41:55,185 --> 00:41:56,953
（呜咽）
(whimpers)

1007
00:41:57,087 --> 00:41:58,789
是的.（叹息）
Yep. (sighs)

1008
00:41:58,922 --> 00:42:00,256
我知道很多.
I get that a lot.

1009
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,626
第一印象等等.
First impressions and all.

1010
00:42:02,759 --> 00:42:04,595
（呜咽）
(whimpers)

1011
00:42:04,728 --> 00:42:06,129
（喵喵叫）
(meows, yowls)

1012
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:07,898
不，不，不，不（呜咽）
No, no, no, no. (whimpers)

1013
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:10,934
（喘息）
(panting)

1014
00:42:11,067 --> 00:42:12,636
（叹息）
(sighs)

1015
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,039
没关系.没关系.
Uh, it's okay. It's okay.

1016
00:42:16,172 --> 00:42:18,108
我不会伤害你的.我知道你很害怕.
I'm not gonna hurt you. I know you're scared.

1017
00:42:18,241 --> 00:42:20,343
如果我是你，我也会的.
I would be, too, if I were you.

1018
00:42:21,277 --> 00:42:22,846
给我一个机会.
Just give me a chance.

1019
00:42:22,979 --> 00:42:24,114
（轻轻地喵喵叫）
(meows quietly)

1020
00:42:24,247 --> 00:42:27,217
事实上，我们有很多共同点.
Truth is we actually have a lot in common.

1021
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,219
不要告诉任何人，
Don't tell anyone,

1022
00:42:29,352 --> 00:42:32,088
但我喜欢一点点抓伤
but I love a little scratch

1023
00:42:32,222 --> 00:42:34,390
就在我耳朵后面.
on the spot behind my ears.

1024
00:42:34,524 --> 00:42:36,226
你知道，就在那里.
You know, right there.

1025
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:38,428
最好的.
The best.

1026
00:42:39,796 --> 00:42:41,598
（喵喵）
(meows)

1027
00:42:43,033 --> 00:42:45,802
来吧，基蒂.
Come on, kitty.

1028
00:42:46,803 --> 00:42:48,371
（嗅嗅）
(sniffing)

1029
00:42:48,504 --> 00:42:50,841
（喵喵、咕噜）
(meows, purrs)

1030
00:42:56,279 --> 00:42:58,514
-**-（咕噜声）
-* * -(purring)

1031
00:43:03,687 --> 00:43:06,022
-对.谁是一只好猫-（喵喵）
-Yeah. Who's a good kitty? -(meows)

1032
00:43:06,156 --> 00:43:08,058
-谁是一只好猫-狼蛛：嗯，狼？
-Who's a good kitty? -TARANTULA: Uh, Wolf?

1033
00:43:08,191 --> 00:43:10,994
你救了他？
Um, you saved him?

1034
00:43:11,127 --> 00:43:12,395
果酱：是的！
MARMALADE: Yes!

1035
00:43:12,528 --> 00:43:15,465
（咯咯笑）：是的.它起作用了.
(chuckling): Yes. It's working.

1036
00:43:15,598 --> 00:43:16,833
你拍的？
You-you filmed that?

1037
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:19,402
是的，他们开始喜欢你了.
Yes, and they're starting to like you.

1038
00:43:19,535 --> 00:43:20,570
鲨鱼（咯咯笑）：是啊！
SHARK (chuckling): Yeah!

1039
00:43:20,704 --> 00:43:22,438
-好吧-（呜呜声）
-All right! -(whooping)

1040
00:43:22,572 --> 00:43:23,707
这可能就足够了
This might just be enough

1041
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,175
为了在晚会上赢得客人.
to win over the guests at the gala.

1042
00:43:25,308 --> 00:43:27,277
-现在我们在说话-是的-好吧
-Now we're talking! -Yes! -All right!

1043
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:30,013
狼蛛：是的，我们做到了！好吧
TARANTULA: Yeah, we did it! All right!

1044
00:43:30,146 --> 00:43:31,782
果酱：嗯，狼？
MARMALADE: Uh, Wolf?

1045
00:43:31,915 --> 00:43:34,317
我必须说，你真的转过了一个弯.
I must say, you've really turned a corner.

1046
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,319
-你真的明白了-真正地
-You're really getting it. -Really?

1047
00:43:36,452 --> 00:43:38,021
-谢谢-（喵喵）
-Oh, uh, thanks. -(meows)

1048
00:43:38,154 --> 00:43:39,189
现在，我是认真的.
Now, I mean it.

1049
00:43:39,322 --> 00:43:41,257
我可以从头到尾看到它.
And I can see it from tip to tail.

1050
00:43:42,025 --> 00:43:45,561
真遗憾，你得背这么多行李.
It's just a shame that you have to carry all that baggage.

1051
00:43:46,429 --> 00:43:48,932
你在说什么...你是说那些家伙？
What are you talk... You mean the guys?

1052
00:43:49,065 --> 00:43:50,333
什么意思？
What do you mean?

1053
00:43:50,466 --> 00:43:51,835
你有很大的潜力，狼，
MARMALADE: You have great potential, Wolf,

1054
00:43:51,968 --> 00:43:53,436
但在某个时刻，你必须做出选择
but at some point, you're going to have to choose

1055
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:56,707
在你的朋友或美好生活之间.
between your friends or the good life.

1056
00:44:00,877 --> 00:44:02,913
（打鼾）
(snoring)

1057
00:44:05,581 --> 00:44:07,751
嘿你还醒着吗？
Hey. You still awake?

1058
00:44:07,884 --> 00:44:09,419
（猫叫）
(cat meows)

1059
00:44:09,552 --> 00:44:11,121
你把猫带进来了？
You-you brought the cat in?

1060
00:44:11,254 --> 00:44:12,956
（笑）：是的.是的，是的.
(chuckling): Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1061
00:44:13,089 --> 00:44:15,025
我只是...我只是把它留着以后用.
I'm just... I'm just saving it up for later.

1062
00:44:15,158 --> 00:44:16,559
为什么？怎么了？
Why? What's up?

1063
00:44:17,393 --> 00:44:19,029
我只是有点担心，
I was just getting a little worried,

1064
00:44:19,162 --> 00:44:20,831
既然你成了...
since you've kind of become a...

1065
00:44:20,964 --> 00:44:22,933
-成为什么-（咕噜声）
-Become a what? -(purring)

1066
00:44:23,066 --> 00:44:25,101
你知道，老师的宠儿.
You know, teacher's pet.

1067
00:44:25,235 --> 00:44:27,437
吃果酱会很舒服.
Getting all cozy with Marmalade.

1068
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:29,539
你摇尾巴什么的.
Your tail wagging and everything.

1069
00:44:29,672 --> 00:44:31,641
嗯，是的，因为它必须是可信的.
Well, yeah, because it has to be believable.

1070
00:44:31,775 --> 00:44:34,510
嗯哼.是的，我想是的.
Uh-huh. Yeah, I guess so.

1071
00:44:34,644 --> 00:44:37,247
只要这都是计划的一部分.
As long as it's all part of the plan.

1072
00:44:38,114 --> 00:44:40,683
这都是计划的一部分，不是吗？
It is all part of the plan, isn't it?

1073
00:44:40,817 --> 00:44:43,954
斯内克，老兄，是谁先计划的？
Snake, buddy, who made the plan to begin with?

1074
00:44:44,087 --> 00:44:45,488
是的.
You did.

1075
00:44:45,621 --> 00:44:49,092
所以我是最坚持计划的人，对吗？
So I'm the one who sticks to the plan the most, right?

1076
00:44:50,727 --> 00:44:52,295
是啊，莉...嗯，是的，好吧...
Yeah, ri... Uh, yeah, ok...

1077
00:44:52,428 --> 00:44:54,664
我想这是有道理的.
I guess that makes sense, yeah.

1078
00:44:54,798 --> 00:44:57,200
但如果计划要改变，
But if the plan were ever to change,

1079
00:44:57,333 --> 00:45:00,036
你会告诉我的，对吧？
you'd-you'd tell me, right?

1080
00:45:02,538 --> 00:45:04,674
我向你保证.
You have my word.

1081
00:45:04,808 --> 00:45:06,843
变坏...
Go bad...

1082
00:45:07,643 --> 00:45:09,545
或者回家.
Or go home.

1083
00:45:17,387 --> 00:45:19,555
-嘿，斯内克-是吗-（咕噜声）
-Hey, Snake. -Yeah? -(purring)

1084
00:45:19,689 --> 00:45:21,892

Is it true sharks can smell blood a mile away?

1150
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:07,457

好了，沃尔夫，你在忙什么？
Okay, Wolf, what are you up to?

对，像这样的罪犯，
Yeah, with criminals like this,

1163

你必须狡猾、微妙、隐形.

我懂了.你丢了羊皮.
I see. You lost the sheep's clothing.

UH（清嗓子）

我只想花点时间来认识一下
I just want to take a moment to recognize

1271
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:09,425
对我们的新观点负责的人.
the one responsible for our new outlook.

1272
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:12,061
我们杰出的导师，
Our brilliant mentor,

1273
00:53:12,194 --> 00:53:13,796
-启蒙的典范-去做吧-来吧

（欢呼声）
(cheering)

1280
00:53:32,114 --> 00:53:34,384
警长，我能为您效劳吗？
Chief, may I do the honors?

1281
00:53:37,553 --> 00:53:38,688
这不是计划.
That's not the plan.

1282
00:53:38,821 --> 00:53:39,855
发生了什么事？
What is happening?

1283
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:41,391
他变得无赖了.
He's gone rogue.

1284
00:53:42,858 --> 00:53:44,694
交易就是交易.
A deal's a deal.

1285
00:53:45,728 --> 00:53:48,564
凭借赋予我的权力，这是我的荣幸
By the power vested in me, it is a pleasure

1286
00:53:48,698 --> 00:53:51,200
给坏人一个完整的标准...
to grant the Bad Guys a full par...

1287
00:53:51,334 --> 00:53:53,569
（客人们喘着气，喃喃地说）
(guests gasping, murmuring)

1288
00:53:55,237 --> 00:53:57,807
-真奇怪-陨石不见了！
-That was weird. -MAN: The meteorite is gone!

1289
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,309
有人偷了！
Somebody stole it!

1290
00:54:01,877 --> 00:54:03,279
-（酋长呻吟）-酋长.

1291
00:54:03,413 --> 00:54:05,281
-狼.（咆哮）-来吧.
-Wolf. (growls) -Come on.

1292
00:54:05,415 --> 00:54:07,049
你不可能认为是我们干的.
You can't possibly think that we did this.

1293
00:54:07,182 --> 00:54:09,385
（通过扬声器）：再见，笨蛋！
(over speakers): So long, suckers!

1294
00:54:10,486 --> 00:54:11,887

00:54:12,021 --> 00:54:13,356
抓住他们！

1296
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:15,991
（喧闹）
(clamoring)

1297
00:54:20,763 --> 00:54:23,098
UH（咯咯笑）
Uh... (chuckles)

1298
00:54:23,232 --> 00:54:25,535
-（喘息）-（警官们咕哝着）
-(panting) -(officers grunting)

1299
00:54:26,802 --> 00:54:28,471
在这里在这里
Here. Here.

1300
00:54:28,604 --> 00:54:31,173
-你在干什么-我要把一切都还给你.
-What are you doing? -I'm giving it all back.

1301
00:54:31,307 --> 00:54:32,408
嗯？
Huh?

1302
00:54:32,542 --> 00:54:34,610
-（吵闹声）-对不起.
-(clamoring) -Excuse me.

1303
00:54:34,744 --> 00:54:36,779
（喘息、咕哝）
(panting, grunting)

1304
00:54:37,647 --> 00:54:40,149
-后面发生了什么-我做不到.
-What happened back there? -I couldn't do it.

1305
00:54:40,282 --> 00:54:42,017
你不能做是什么意思？
What do you mean, you couldn't do it?

1306
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:43,419
-我只是...我-不
-I-I-I just... I... -No!

1307
00:54:43,553 --> 00:54:45,855
-我不跑-警察：小屋，小屋，小屋...
-I do not run. -OFFICERS: Hut, hut, hut...

1308
00:54:45,988 --> 00:54:47,657
我不是这样滚的.
That is not how I roll.

1309
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:49,592
食人鱼，不要做任何疯狂的事.
Piranha, don't do anything crazy.

1310
00:54:49,725 --> 00:54:51,060
（笑）
(laughing)

1311
00:54:51,193 --> 00:54:54,497
疯狂是我在派对上带来的，奇科.
Crazy is what I bring to the party, chico.

1312
00:54:58,834 --> 00:55:01,003
（鲨鱼呻吟）
(Shark groans)

1313
00:55:02,372 --> 00:55:03,739
嘿，你搞错了.
Hey, you're making a mistake.

1314
00:55:03,873 --> 00:55:04,840
不是我们干的.
We didn't do it.

1315
00:55:04,974 --> 00:55:06,108
我知道我们总是这么说，
I know we always say that,

1316
00:55:06,241 --> 00:55:07,309
但这次是真的.
but this time it's actually true.

1317
00:55:07,443 --> 00:55:09,311
啦啦啦啦.听不见.
A-la-la-la-la. Can't hear you.

1318
00:55:09,445 --> 00:55:11,547
-有罪，有罪，有罪-和果酱谈谈.
-Guilty, guilty, guilty. -Talk to Marmalade.

1319
00:55:11,681 --> 00:55:13,483
我们现在真的很好.他会告诉你的.
We're really good now. He'll tell you.

1320
00:55:13,616 --> 00:55:14,717
教授
Professor!

1321
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:17,119
今晚的标题是：改变是不可能的.
Tonight's headline: Change is impossible.

1322
00:55:17,252 --> 00:55:19,121
你应该根据封面来判断一本书，
You should always judge a book by its cover,

1323
00:55:19,254 --> 00:55:21,491
所有的刻板印象都得到了肯定.
and all stereotypes have been affirmed.

1324
00:55:21,624 --> 00:55:23,225
橘子酱：停下来，看在上帝的份上！
MARMALADE: Stop, for goodness' sake!

1325
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:24,660
让我和他们谈谈.
Let me speak to them.

1326
00:55:24,794 --> 00:55:27,329
我肯定有些误会.
I'm-I'm sure there's been some misunderstanding.

1327
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:30,265
-（门开了）-啊，果酱教授.
-(door opens) -Ah, Professor Marmalade.

1328
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,767
你还有五分钟.
You've got five minutes.

1329
00:55:31,901 --> 00:55:33,903
这次没有交易.
No deals this time.

1330
00:55:34,036 --> 00:55:35,070
你必须帮助我们.
Y-You have to help us.

1331
00:55:35,204 --> 00:55:36,739
告诉他们，告诉他们我们没有这么做.
Tell 'em. Tell 'em we didn't do it.

1332
00:55:36,872 --> 00:55:38,741
好了，好了.当然不是你干的.
There, there. Of course you didn't do it.

1333
00:55:38,874 --> 00:55:40,009
你怎么能？
How could you?

1334
00:55:40,142 --> 00:55:43,513
毕竟，你是个好孩子.
After all, you're such a good boy.

1335
00:55:44,313 --> 00:55:47,683
你真是个好孩子.
You're such a good boy.

1336
00:55:47,817 --> 00:55:49,519
让我脊梁骨颤抖.
That shiver up my spine.

1337
00:55:49,652 --> 00:55:51,887
我的小尾巴在摇摆.
The wag in my tiny tail.

1338
00:55:52,021 --> 00:55:53,255
逮捕他们！
Arrest them!

1339
00:55:53,389 --> 00:55:55,157
如果我们做个小实验呢，黛安？
What if we tried a little experiment, Diane?

1340
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:57,593
如你所知，我为上帝举办的晚会...
As you know, my Gala for Goodness...

1341
00:55:57,727 --> 00:55:59,962
蒂芙尼：传说中的爱情陨石坑
TIFFANY: Where the legendary Love Crater Meteorite

1342
00:56:00,095 --> 00:56:02,632
将首次展出.
will be on display for the first time ever.

1343
00:56:02,765 --> 00:56:06,068
今晚所有的目光都会聚焦在你身上，而不是我.
All eyes will be on you tonight, not me.

1344
00:56:06,902 --> 00:56:08,137
你真是个...
WOMAN: You're such a...

1345
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:10,573
果酱：好孩子.
MARMALADE: Good boy.

1346
00:56:11,574 --> 00:56:12,975
你
You.

1347
00:56:13,108 --> 00:56:14,677
全是你.
It was all you.

1348
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:16,211
你在说什么，狼？
What are you talking about, Wolf?

1349
00:56:16,345 --> 00:56:17,613
老太太，金色海豚，
The old lady, the Golden Dolphin,

1350
00:56:17,747 --> 00:56:19,482
很好的训练让我们来到这里，
good training-- it was all to get us here,

1351
00:56:19,615 --> 00:56:21,851
这样他就能偷走陨石，让我们承担责任.
so he could steal the meteorite and let us take the fall.

1352
00:56:21,984 --> 00:56:23,653
哇.哇，什么老太太？
Whoa. Whoa, what old lady?

1353
00:56:23,786 --> 00:56:26,288
为什么豚鼠想要陨石呢？
And-and why would a guinea pig want a meteorite anyway?

1354
00:56:26,422 --> 00:56:29,191
（橘子酱咯咯笑）
(Marmalade chuckling)

1355
00:56:29,324 --> 00:56:32,127
伙计们，他吓到我了.
Uh, guys, he's creeping me out.

1356
00:56:32,261 --> 00:56:33,863
等等，什么？发生什么事？
Wait, what? What's going on?

1357
00:56:33,996 --> 00:56:35,264
有人把我转过来.
Someone turn me around.

1358
00:56:35,397 --> 00:56:37,032
果酱：好吧，好吧.
MARMALADE: Well, well.

1359
00:56:37,166 --> 00:56:39,068
所以，你终于明白了.
So, you finally get it.

1360
00:56:39,201 --> 00:56:40,603
-等等-什么
-Wait. -What?

1361
00:56:40,736 --> 00:56:42,204
你偷了陨石？
You stole the meteorite?

1362
00:56:42,337 --> 00:56:44,306
哦，不仅仅是陨石.
Oh, it's not just a meteorite.

1363
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,875
我告诉过你们这是个屁股.
I told you guys it's a butt.

1364
00:56:46,008 --> 00:56:47,209
不是屁股！
It's not a butt!

1365
00:56:47,342 --> 00:56:48,544
（深呼吸）
(takes deep breath)

1366
00:56:48,678 --> 00:56:51,146
它是终极的能源.
It's the ultimate power source.

1367
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,149
你看，当它来袭时，科学家们发现
You see, when it struck, scientists found that

1368
00:56:54,283 --> 00:56:56,018
它发出电磁频率
it emitted an electromagnetic frequency

1369
00:56:56,151 --> 00:56:58,087
不像地球上的任何东西.
unlike anything else on Earth.

1370
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,889
我要利用它的力量
I'm going to harness its power

1371
00:57:00,022 --> 00:57:03,225
完成了世界上最大的抢劫案.
to pull off the greatest heist the world has ever seen.

1372
00:57:04,026 --> 00:57:05,961
你应该在有机会的时候吃掉他.
You should've eaten him when you had the chance.

1373
00:57:06,095 --> 00:57:07,563
-是的-但为什么是我们？
-Yep. -But why us?

1374
00:57:07,697 --> 00:57:09,932
因为你是完美的替罪羊.
Because you're the perfect patsies.

1375
00:57:10,065 --> 00:57:13,536
拜托，当人们在字典里查“bad”的时候，
Come on, when people look up "bad" in the dictionary,

1376
00:57:13,669 --> 00:57:16,138
他们看到一只可爱的豚鼠了吗？
do they see a sweet, adorable guinea pig?

1377
00:57:16,271 --> 00:57:18,140
不，他们看见你了.
No. They see you.

1378
00:57:18,273 --> 00:57:20,510
他们永远都会.
And they always will.

1379
00:57:20,643 --> 00:57:21,911
好吧，好吧.
Okay, fine.

1380
00:57:22,044 --> 00:57:23,312
但你陷害了我们.
But you set us up.

1381
00:57:23,445 --> 00:57:24,714
（咯咯笑）：哦，pish pish.
(chuckling): Oh, pish-pish.

1382
00:57:24,847 --> 00:57:27,683
说实话，进化让你陷害了.
Let's be honest-- evolution set you up.

1383
00:57:27,817 --> 00:57:30,019
但这里的Wolfie真的做到了.
But Wolfie here really clinched it.

1384
00:57:30,152 --> 00:57:32,955
你落入了我的每一个陷阱，
You fell for every one of my traps,

1385
00:57:33,088 --> 00:57:36,892
从救一个无助的小老太太开始.
starting with saving a helpless little old lady.

1386
00:57:37,026 --> 00:57:40,195
沃尔夫，他在说什么？
Wolf, what's he talking about?

1387
00:57:42,464 --> 00:57:43,999
果酱：哎呀.
MARMALADE: Whoops.

1388
00:57:44,133 --> 00:57:46,869
我说得太多了吗？
Did I say too much?

1389
00:57:47,002 --> 00:57:49,338
不管怎样，看起来又一次，
Anyhoo, looks like, yet again,

1390
00:57:49,471 --> 00:57:53,108
大灰狼被一只小猪打败了.
the Big Bad Wolf got outsmarted by a little piggy.

1391
00:57:53,242 --> 00:57:56,078
你这个小脸蛋！
You little pouchy-cheeked rat!

1392
00:57:56,211 --> 00:57:57,613
我要杀了你！听到了吗？
I'll kill you! You hear me?

1393
00:57:57,747 --> 00:57:59,882
-你死定了！你是-帮助帮助帮助
-You're dead! You're de... -Help! Help! Help!

1394
00:58:00,015 --> 00:58:01,651
大灰狼正在攻击我.
The Big Bad Wolf is attacking me.

1395
00:58:01,784 --> 00:58:04,319
哦，现在你永远完了，狼！
Oh, now you are done forever, Wolf!

1396
00:58:09,424 --> 00:58:12,227
-（发动机转速）-（警报器鸣叫）
-(engine revs) -(sirens wailing)

1397
00:58:13,563 --> 00:58:15,397
-蒂芙尼：教授，教授，
-(Marmalade whimpering) -TIFFANY: Professor, Professor,

1398
00:58:15,531 --> 00:58:17,466
有没有想过坏人是怎么对付的
any thoughts on how the Bad Guys managed

1399
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,002
在肉眼可见的地方偷走陨石？
to steal the meteorite in plain sight?

1400
00:58:20,135 --> 00:58:21,370
好吧，在我脑子里，
Well, off the top of my head,

1401
00:58:21,503 --> 00:58:23,238
也许他们以前访问过这个网站
perhaps they accessed the site previously

1402
00:58:23,372 --> 00:58:24,640
建立了一个复杂的系统
and set up an intricate system

1403
00:58:24,774 --> 00:58:26,308
-隧道和活板门-蒂芙妮：嗯.
-of tunnels and trapdoors... -TIFFANY: Uh-huh.

1404
00:58:26,441 --> 00:58:27,777
果酱：...这可能是远程触发的
MARMALADE: ...that could be remotely triggered

1405
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:29,378
把陨石吸到等待区，
to suck the meteorite down into a holding area,

1406
00:58:29,511 --> 00:58:31,080
-但我怎么知道呢-蒂芙妮：完全正确.
-but how should I know? -TIFFANY: Totally.

1407
00:58:31,213 --> 00:58:33,949
果酱：我是说，他们是精神错乱的主谋，不是我.
MARMALADE: I mean, they're the deranged masterminds, not me.

1408
00:58:56,171 --> 00:58:58,641
狼：我要把一切都还给你.
WOLF: I'm giving it all back.

1409
00:59:00,776 --> 00:59:02,645
（风啸）
(wind howling)

1410
00:59:22,497 --> 00:59:24,233
鲨鱼：真不敢相信我们被双重欺骗了
SHARK: I can't believe we got double-crossed

1411
00:59:24,366 --> 00:59:25,668
一只小啮齿动物.
by a tiny rodent.

1412
00:59:25,801 --> 00:59:28,137
我们被一只啮齿类动物出卖了好吧，
Oh, we got double-crossed by a rodent all right,

1413
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:30,973
-但是，嗯，一点也不小-什么
-but, uh, not a tiny one. -What?

1414
00:59:31,106 --> 00:59:33,609
这应该是我们在骗橘子酱.
This was supposed to be us conning Marmalade.

1415
00:59:33,743 --> 00:59:36,912
原来是狼在骗我们.
It turns out it was Wolf conning us.

1416
00:59:37,046 --> 00:59:38,580
（干呕）
(retching)

1417
00:59:38,714 --> 00:59:40,582
你听上去熟悉吗，沃尔夫？
Does that sound familiar to you, Wolf?

1418
00:59:40,716 --> 00:59:42,384
你为什么这么想？
Why-why would you think that?

1419
00:59:42,517 --> 00:59:45,120
我不知道，也许是因为你破坏了
Oh, I don't know, maybe because you just sabotaged

1420
00:59:45,254 --> 00:59:47,356
这是我们一生中最大的抢劫.
the biggest heist of our lives.

1421
00:59:47,489 --> 00:59:50,592
我想你应该向我们解释一下，伙计.
I think you owe us an explanation, buddy.

1422
00:59:50,726 --> 00:59:52,027
（叹息）
(sighs)

1423
00:59:52,161 --> 00:59:53,262
可以你说得对.
Okay. You're right.

1424
00:59:53,395 --> 00:59:54,930
事情就是这样.
This is what happened.

1425
00:59:55,064 --> 00:59:57,599
回到博物馆，我刚想偷一位老太太的钱包.
Back in the museum, I just tried to steal an old lady's purse.

1426
00:59:57,733 --> 00:59:59,568
-（相机快门捕捉）-经典抓取和抓取.
-(camera shutter snaps) -Classic snatch and grab.

1427
00:59:59,702 --> 01:00:01,904
试过了吗？你什么时候开始尝试的
Tried to? Since when do you try

1428
01:00:02,037 --> 01:00:03,906
去偷东西而不仅仅是偷？
to steal something and not just steal it?

1429
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:07,276
我正想偷钱包，这时老太太摔倒了...
I was trying to steal the purse when the old lady fell and...

1430
01:00:07,409 --> 01:00:09,378
（清了清嗓子）我帮了她一点忙.
(clears throat) I kind of helped her.

1431
01:00:09,511 --> 01:00:10,412
-什么-（相机快门捕捉）
-What? -(camera shutter snaps)

1432
01:00:10,545 --> 01:00:12,514
我帮了她一把.
I kind of helped her.

1433
01:00:12,648 --> 01:00:14,516
-但后来你偷了她的钱包-（相机快门捕捉）
-But then you stole her purse. -(camera shutter snaps)

1434
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:15,951
（笑）：不，我没有.
(chuckling): No, I didn't.

1435
01:00:16,085 --> 01:00:18,453
我救了老太太她拥抱了我，
I saved the old lady, and she hugged me,

1436
01:00:18,587 --> 01:00:21,090
我摇着尾巴，不知道那是什么，
and my tail wagged, and I didn't know what it was,

1437
01:00:21,223 --> 01:00:24,593
但感觉，呃，你知道...好的
but it felt, uh, you know... good.

1438
01:00:24,727 --> 01:00:26,195
（鲨鱼、狼蛛和食人鱼喘息）
(Shark, Tarantula and Piranha gasp)

1439
01:00:26,328 --> 01:00:27,362
啊.
Ah.

1440
01:00:27,496 --> 01:00:29,298
但后来你偷了钱包.
But then you stole the purse.

1441
01:00:29,431 --> 01:00:30,866
其他人：不！
OTHERS: No!

1442
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,235
我听到猪对你说的话了
You know, I heard what the pig said to you

1443
01:00:33,368 --> 01:00:34,937
让我们放松.
about cutting us loose.

1444
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:36,739
等待比如“我们”我们？
Wait. Like, "us" us?

1445
01:00:36,872 --> 01:00:38,841
但我从没想过你真的会这么做.
But I never thought you'd actually do it, man.

1446
01:00:38,974 --> 01:00:40,409
嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1447
01:00:40,542 --> 01:00:42,945
我永远不会...我想...
I-I would never... I was trying to...

1448
01:00:43,078 --> 01:00:45,147
我想给我们找到更好的生活.
I was trying to find us a better life.

1449
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,751
我们的生活是完美的，直到你决定毁掉它.
Our life was perfect until you decided to ruin it.

1450
01:00:48,884 --> 01:00:50,085
我没有.
I didn't.

1451
01:00:50,219 --> 01:00:51,653
你们在晚会上感觉到了.
You guys felt it at the gala.

1452
01:00:51,787 --> 01:00:53,622
掌声，欢呼声.
The clapping, the cheering.

1453
01:00:53,756 --> 01:00:56,025
我们不仅仅是...而不仅仅是可怕的恶棍.
We were more than... than just scary villains.

1454
01:00:56,158 --> 01:00:57,259
他们爱我们.
They loved us.

1455
01:00:57,392 --> 01:00:59,829
哦，是吗？如果他们这么爱我们，
Oh, yeah? If they loved us so much,

1456
01:00:59,962 --> 01:01:03,565
我们怎么会因为没犯的罪而坐牢？
how come we're in prison for a crime we didn't commit?

1457
01:01:03,699 --> 01:01:05,835
你知道吗？我给你这个橘子酱.
You know what? I'll give Marmalade this.

1458
01:01:05,968 --> 01:01:08,003
至少他看到了世界的本来面目：
At least he sees the world for what it is:

1459
01:01:08,137 --> 01:01:10,272
有些人害怕的地方
a place where some people are scary

1460
01:01:10,405 --> 01:01:12,307
有些人很害怕.
and some people are scared.

1461
01:01:12,441 --> 01:01:13,675
哦，是吗？
Oh, yeah?

1462
01:01:13,809 --> 01:01:15,377
我已经厌倦了害怕.
Well, I'm tired of being scary.

1463
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:17,079
我厌倦了做一个被遗弃的人.
I'm-I'm tired of being an outcast.

1464
01:01:17,212 --> 01:01:18,814
也许我不想成为...
Maybe I don't want to be a...

1465
01:01:18,948 --> 01:01:20,282
什么坏人？
What? A Bad Guy?

1466
01:01:20,415 --> 01:01:22,451
不想再做坏人了吧？
Don't want to be a Bad Guy anymore, huh?

1467
01:01:22,584 --> 01:01:24,686
说吧，狼.
Say it, Wolf.

1468
01:01:26,756 --> 01:01:28,223
是的，我想是的.
Yeah, I thought so.

1469
01:01:28,357 --> 01:01:30,359
还有我们，你一生的朋友？
And us, your lifelong friends?

1470
01:01:30,492 --> 01:01:31,961
我们只是在阻止你？
We're just holding you back?

1471
01:01:32,094 --> 01:01:33,896
是的，也许你是！
Yeah, maybe you are!

1472
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:36,131
（喘息）
(gasps)

1473
01:01:36,265 --> 01:01:37,867
（咆哮）收回！
(snarls) Take it back!

1474
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,469
-（喘息）-拿回去！道歉
-(gasping) -Take it back! Apologize!

1475
01:01:40,602 --> 01:01:42,337
警卫：嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿！
GUARD: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1476
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:43,973
监狱不是打架的地方.
Prison is no place for fighting.

1477
01:01:44,106 --> 01:01:45,440
（警卫喊道）
(guard yells)

1478
01:01:45,574 --> 01:01:47,376
（呻吟）：告诉他.
(groaning): Tell that to him.

1479
01:01:47,509 --> 01:01:48,844
嗯？
Huh?

1480
01:01:52,982 --> 01:01:55,550
-（笑）：什么-（警卫喊道）
-(chuckling): What? -(guards yelling)

1481
01:01:55,684 --> 01:01:57,920
（咕哝着，喊叫着）
(grunting, yelling)

1482
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:03,525
（快速呼噜）
(grunting rapidly)

1483
01:02:03,658 --> 01:02:06,095
（继续咕哝和大喊）
(grunting and yelling continue)

1484
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,101
（警卫喊道）
(guard yelling)

1485
01:02:12,234 --> 01:02:13,803
-嘘-（咕哝）
-Shh. -(grunts)

1486
01:02:15,905 --> 01:02:18,908
（继续咕哝和大喊）
(grunting and yelling continue)

1487
01:02:19,374 --> 01:02:21,043
-（嘎吱声）-（咕噜声）
-(crunching) -(grunting)

1488
01:02:24,746 --> 01:02:26,882
（尖叫、呜咽）
(screams, whimpers)

1489
01:02:29,751 --> 01:02:31,954
卫兵：快跑！
GUARD: Run!

1490
01:02:35,024 --> 01:02:37,092
（呻吟）
(groans)

1491
01:02:38,393 --> 01:02:39,962
-哦-等等，等等.等等.
-Oh! -W-W-Wait, wait. Ho-Hold on.

1492
01:02:41,063 --> 01:02:42,231
（其他人喘着粗气）
(others gasping)

1493
01:02:42,364 --> 01:02:43,298
大家：黛安？
ALL: Diane?

1494
01:02:43,432 --> 01:02:44,566
但是你怎么知道该怎么做呢
But how do you know how to do

1495
01:02:44,699 --> 01:02:45,868
所有的踢踏拳？
all of that kick-kick-punch-punch?

1496
01:02:46,001 --> 01:02:48,237
等等，你是那个深红色的爪子？
Wait a sec, you're the Crimson Paw?

1497
01:02:50,772 --> 01:02:52,241
狼：囚徒女王，
WOLF: The queen of cons,

1498
01:02:52,374 --> 01:02:53,642
特技瑞士军刀.
acrobatic Swiss Army knife.

1499
01:02:53,775 --> 01:02:55,110
两次偷了尊邦戈钻石.
Stole the Zumpango diamond twice.

1500
01:02:55,244 --> 01:02:57,612
一次是为了赚钱，第二次只是为了好玩.
Once for profit, second time just for fun.

1501
01:02:57,746 --> 01:03:00,149
从未被识别，从未被发现.
Never identified, never caught.

1502
01:03:00,282 --> 01:03:03,118
（笑）我想我仍然是最好的坏人
(chuckles) Guess I'm still the best bad guy

1503
01:03:03,252 --> 01:03:05,120
全世界都见过.
the world has ever seen.

1504
01:03:05,254 --> 01:03:07,689
-至少我以前是-（警报声）
-Ugh, at least I used to be. -(alarm blaring)

1505
01:03:07,823 --> 01:03:09,158
-（鲨鱼喘息）-狼蛛：嗯？
-(Shark gasps) -TARANTULA: Huh?

1506
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:12,094
（警卫喊道）
(guards yelling)

1507
01:03:13,195 --> 01:03:14,596
（大叫）
(yells)

1508
01:03:14,729 --> 01:03:17,666
（爆炸声隆隆）
(explosions booming)

1509
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,202
不，我还是最好的.
Nope, I'm still the best.

1510
01:03:20,335 --> 01:03:22,737
就像骑偷来的自行车.
Just like riding a stolen bicycle.

1511
01:03:22,872 --> 01:03:25,407
你有点...哎哟
Oh, uh, you got a little... Ouch.

1512
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,609
你为什么要救我们？
Hey, wh-why did you save us anyway?

1513
01:03:27,742 --> 01:03:29,845
晚会结束后我知道有些不对劲，
After the gala, I knew something wasn't right,

1514
01:03:29,979 --> 01:03:31,981
所以我做了一些调查，那颗流星...
so I did some investigating, and that meteor...

1515
01:03:32,114 --> 01:03:35,384
我知道.某种宇宙超级天线的东西.
I know. Some kind of cosmic mega-super-antennae thing.

1516
01:03:35,517 --> 01:03:38,220
正当如果通过一系列电离晶体传导，
Right. If conducted through an array of ionized crystals,

1517
01:03:38,353 --> 01:03:40,222
它将产生一个巨大的心理动力场
it will generate a massive psychokinetic field

1518
01:03:40,355 --> 01:03:41,556
城市的大小.
the size of a city.

1519
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:43,025
天哪.我打断你了吗？
Oh, my gosh. Did I interrupt you?

1520
01:03:43,158 --> 01:03:44,259
你要这么说吗？
Were you gonna say that?

1521
01:03:44,393 --> 01:03:46,962
呃，我，我，我本想更专业一点，
Uh, I-I-I was gonna be a little more technical,

1522
01:03:47,096 --> 01:03:49,999
-但你知道要点了-（咯咯笑）
-but you got the gist of it. -(chuckles)

1523
01:03:51,066 --> 01:03:54,203
果酱需要停止，但我一个人做不到.
Marmalade needs to be stopped, but I can't do it alone.

1524
01:03:54,336 --> 01:03:56,438
你比任何人都了解他的化合物.
You know his compound better than anyone.

1525
01:03:56,571 --> 01:03:58,207
你可以相信我们.
You can count on us.

1526
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:59,508
对吧，伙计们？
Right, guys?

1527
01:03:59,641 --> 01:04:01,543
没有“我们”
There is no "us."

1528
01:04:01,676 --> 01:04:03,212
我们完了，狼.
We're through, Wolf.

1529
01:04:03,345 --> 01:04:04,746
完成.菲尼托.
Done. Finito.

1530
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,216
就因为那场小小的争吵？
Because of that little tiff back there?

1531
01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:09,551
拜托，伙计，我们就是这么做的.
Come on, man, that's what we do.

1532
01:04:09,684 --> 01:04:11,253
你发球，我截击.
You serve, I volley.

1533
01:04:11,386 --> 01:04:13,355
那是我们的小舞会.
That's our little dance.

1534
01:04:13,488 --> 01:04:15,557
这次不行.
Not this time.

1535
01:04:20,329 --> 01:04:21,730
食人鱼？
Piranha?

1536
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,301
网？
Webs?

1537
01:04:26,435 --> 01:04:28,037
抱歉Wolfie.
Sorry, Wolfie.

1538
01:04:29,804 --> 01:04:31,106
（咯咯笑）：鲨鱼.
(chuckling): Shark.

1539
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,607
鲨鱼：嗯.
SHARK: Hmm.

1540
01:04:32,741 --> 01:04:34,409
狼：嘿.
WOLF: Hey.

1541
01:04:34,543 --> 01:04:36,111
伙计们？
Guys?

1542
01:04:37,079 --> 01:04:38,380
伙计们？
Guys?

1543
01:04:39,181 --> 01:04:42,717
你想知道我为什么讨厌生日吗，沃尔夫？你…吗？
You want to know why I hate birthdays, Wolf? Do you?

1544
01:04:44,053 --> 01:04:47,822
当你长成一条蛇的时候，没有人来参加你的聚会.
When you grow up a snake, nobody shows up to your party.

1545
01:04:47,957 --> 01:04:50,926
生日时刻提醒着我们
Birthdays are a constant reminder that out there

1546
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:56,065
我只是一个可怕的，一无是处的怪物.
I'm just a scary, good-for-nothing monster.

1547
01:04:57,499 --> 01:04:59,168
是 啊
Yeah.

1548
01:04:59,301 --> 01:05:02,104
但没有什么能比得上只有一个人...
But nothing compares to having the one guy...

1549
01:05:02,237 --> 01:05:05,507
那个我以为可以信任的人
the one guy I thought I could trust

1550
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,742
从背后捅我一刀.
stab me in the back.

1551
01:05:11,246 --> 01:05:13,915
来吧，伙计们.我们从这里出去吧.
Come on, guys. Let's get out of here.

1552
01:05:33,702 --> 01:05:35,270
（没有音频）
(no audio)

1553
01:05:54,556 --> 01:05:57,259
（电爆裂声）
(electrical crackling)

1554
01:05:57,392 --> 01:05:59,628
（有节奏的脉动）
(rhythmic pulsing)

1555
01:06:00,996 --> 01:06:05,034
这才是真正的坏蛋.
Now, this is what a true bad guy looks like.

1556
01:06:05,167 --> 01:06:07,202
（电子音）
(electronic tone)

1557
01:06:11,073 --> 01:06:13,908
我们玩得开心点怎么样？
What do you say we have some fun?

1558
01:06:16,745 --> 01:06:18,647
（隆隆声）
(rumbling)

1559
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:19,881
（狂笑）
(laughing maniacally)

1560
01:06:20,015 --> 01:06:22,817
（爆炸性的嗖嗖声）
(explosive whooshing)

1561
01:06:23,918 --> 01:06:25,954
（喘息、咕哝）
(gasps, grunts)

1562
01:06:26,088 --> 01:06:28,323
（尖叫声）
(screams)

1563
01:06:32,194 --> 01:06:34,729
（闲聊）
(chittering)

1564
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:40,935
（尖叫）
(screaming)

1565
01:06:42,904 --> 01:06:45,140
（吱吱嘎吱的闲聊）
(squeaky chittering)

1566
01:06:52,814 --> 01:06:55,550
嘿你没事吧？
Hey. You okay?

1567
01:06:55,684 --> 01:06:57,319
不，我不好.
No, I'm not okay.

1568
01:06:57,452 --> 01:07:00,155
我非常非常不好.
I'm very, very un-okay.

1569
01:07:00,289 --> 01:07:01,323
（抱怨）
(grumbles)

1570
01:07:01,456 --> 01:07:03,325
刚刚离开我唯一的朋友，
Just left the only friends I have ever had,

1571
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:06,795
那我是什么...（叹息）我在做什么？
so what am I... (sighs) what am I doing?

1572
01:07:07,696 --> 01:07:09,464
（叹息）
(sighs)

1573
01:07:09,598 --> 01:07:12,401
我知道这不容易，
I know this isn't easy,

1574
01:07:12,534 --> 01:07:14,669
把一切抛在脑后.
leaving everything behind.

1575
01:07:14,803 --> 01:07:16,138
-是吗-是 啊
-Do you? -Yeah.

1576
01:07:16,271 --> 01:07:18,607
我是世界上最好的小偷.
I was the best thief in the world.

1577
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:22,611
快速、无畏、有创造力.
Fast, fearless, inventive.

1578
01:07:22,744 --> 01:07:25,580
我只剩下一件东西要偷了.
I just had one thing left to steal.

1579
01:07:25,714 --> 01:07:27,349
金色海豚.
The Golden Dolphin.

1580
01:07:27,482 --> 01:07:29,351
所以你去追了.
So you went after it.

1581
01:07:29,484 --> 01:07:31,353
我不只是去追求它.
I didn't just go after it.

1582
01:07:32,521 --> 01:07:34,423
我做到了.
I had it.

1583
01:07:34,556 --> 01:07:36,791
还有一条清晰的逃生路线.
And a clear escape route.

1584
01:07:39,361 --> 01:07:41,330
但是
But...

1585
01:07:41,463 --> 01:07:43,965
最后我只看到了那只狡猾的狐狸
all I saw in the end was the tricky fox

1586
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:46,868
他们总是告诉我我是.
that they always told me I was.

1587
01:07:47,902 --> 01:07:50,105
它改变了一切.
It changed everything.

1588
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:52,707
所以现在，与其伤害别人，
So, now, instead of hurting people,

1589
01:07:52,841 --> 01:07:54,409
我在帮助他们.（叹息）
I'm helping them. (sighs)

1590
01:07:54,543 --> 01:07:56,111
我还是我自己.（咯咯笑）
I'm still me. (chuckles)

1591
01:07:56,245 --> 01:07:59,348
我只是站在右边的我.
I'm just me on the right side.

1592
01:08:00,815 --> 01:08:02,284
你做得对.
You're doing the right thing.

1593
01:08:02,417 --> 01:08:05,887
有一天你的朋友如果他们是真正的朋友，
And someday your friends, if they're real friends,

1594
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:08,223
我想他们会理解的.
I think they'll understand.

1595
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:11,160
现在，来吧，我们进去吧.
Now, come on, let's get inside.

1596
01:08:11,293 --> 01:08:14,129
-你看起来像刚从监狱里逃出来-（咯咯笑）
-You look like you just busted out of a prison. -(chuckles)

1597
01:08:14,263 --> 01:08:16,131
（两人都喘着粗气）
(both gasp)

1598
01:08:16,265 --> 01:08:17,532
（闲聊）
(chitters)

1599
01:08:17,666 --> 01:08:19,000
-豚鼠？（喘息）-（屋顶上急促的脚步声）
-Guinea pigs? (gasps) -(footsteps scurrying on roof)

1600
01:08:19,134 --> 01:08:20,469
两者都有：果酱.
BOTH: Marmalade.

1601
01:08:20,602 --> 01:08:21,603
让我们跳起来.
Let's bounce.

1602
01:08:23,505 --> 01:08:26,141
这就是大红爪子的藏身之处.
So this is the hideout of the great Crimson Paw.

1603
01:08:26,275 --> 01:08:27,542
-（黛安咯咯笑）-（微波炉发出哔哔声）
-(Diane chuckles) -(microwave beeping)

1604
01:08:27,676 --> 01:08:28,810
小吃休息？
Snack break?

1605
01:08:28,943 --> 01:08:30,679
好吧，时间很奇怪，但你知道.
Okay, oddly timed, but you do you.

1606
01:08:30,812 --> 01:08:31,880
（大叫）
(yells)

1607
01:08:32,013 --> 01:08:33,047
自动语音：身份验证.
AUTOMATED VOICE: Identity verified.

1608
01:08:33,182 --> 01:08:35,417
-什么-欢迎，黛安.
-What? -Welcome, Diane.

1609
01:08:41,156 --> 01:08:44,226
-哇！天哪-（笑）
-Whoa! Holy moly! -(laughing)

1610
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:46,661
（叹息）回家真是太好了.
(sighs) It's so good to be home.

1611
01:08:46,795 --> 01:08:47,896
你在开玩笑吧？
Are you kidding me?

1612
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:49,664
激光瞄准拉链？
Laser-sighted zip line?

1613
01:08:49,798 --> 01:08:52,367
XM-2400雷达干扰机？不可能.
The XM-2400 radar jammer? No way.

1614
01:08:52,501 --> 01:08:54,636
实际上我更喜欢早期的型号.
I actually prefer the earlier model.

1615
01:08:54,769 --> 01:08:56,538
同意不同意.
Agree to disagree.

1616
01:08:56,671 --> 01:08:58,273
这东西也不错.
Uh, this stuff is nice, too.

1617
01:08:58,407 --> 01:08:59,441
（尖叫声）
(screams)

1618
01:08:59,574 --> 01:09:00,909
是的，那是喷灯.
Yeah, that's a blowtorch.

1619
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:03,044
而且，不是你的颜色.
Also, not really your color.

1620
01:09:03,178 --> 01:09:04,346
（呻吟）
(groans)

1621
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:06,147
好的，果酱.
All righty, Marmalade.

1622
01:09:06,281 --> 01:09:09,818
你在干什么，你这个毛茸茸的小怪人？
What are you up to, you fuzzy little weirdo?

1623
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:11,486
我们需要关注这座城市.
We need eyes on the city.

1624
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:12,954
让我们看看是否能破解
Let's see if we can't hack

1625
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,356
进入政府的监控卫星.
into the government's surveillance satellite.

1626
01:09:14,489 --> 01:09:16,225
但你是州长.你就不能问问吗？
But you're the governor. Couldn't you just ask?

1627
01:09:16,358 --> 01:09:18,527
是的，但是...文书工作.
Yeah, but... (splutters) the paperwork.

1628
01:09:19,661 --> 01:09:21,896
（黛安咕哝着）
(Diane muttering)

1629
01:09:23,398 --> 01:09:27,168
我肯定在这里发现了可疑的活动.
I am definitely picking up on suspicious activity here.

1630
01:09:27,302 --> 01:09:29,471
这些是豚鼠的热信号.
Those are guinea pig heat signatures.

1631
01:09:29,604 --> 01:09:31,873
果酱似乎在控制它们.
Marmalade seems to be controlling them.

1632
01:09:32,006 --> 01:09:34,008
但是做什么呢？
But to do what?

1633
01:09:34,142 --> 01:09:35,577
没有明显的目标.
There are no obvious targets.

1634
01:09:37,579 --> 01:09:39,981
那是因为他们在移动目标.
That's because they're moving targets.

1635
01:09:40,114 --> 01:09:43,084
黛安：（喘息）他的慈善筹款.
DIANE: (gasps) His charity fundraiser.

1636
01:09:43,218 --> 01:09:45,487
他要偷他自己名下的钱？
He's gonna steal the money raised in his own name?

1637
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:48,156
这是世界上有史以来最大的抢劫案.
It's the greatest heist the world's ever seen.

1638
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:50,325
卡车里有10亿美元，
$1 billion inside trucks,

1639
01:09:50,459 --> 01:09:52,461
在去全市慈善机构的路上.
on their way to charities all over the city.

1640
01:09:52,594 --> 01:09:53,995
我们需要切断果酱的联系
We need to cut off Marmalade's communication

1641
01:09:54,128 --> 01:09:55,163
和他的豚鼠军队在一起.
with his guinea pig army.

1642
01:09:55,297 --> 01:09:56,831
如果没有信号...
If there's no signal...

1643
01:09:56,965 --> 01:09:58,166
没有抢劫.
There's no heist.

1644
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:00,402
两个：我们必须偷陨石.
BOTH: We have to steal the meteorite.

1645
01:10:00,535 --> 01:10:01,636
很可爱，
That was very cute,

1646
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:03,204
-我们刚才在那里做的事-好吧
-that thing we just did there. -All right.

1647
01:10:03,338 --> 01:10:05,707
穿上你的大女孩裤子.我们正在准备.
Put on your big-girl pants. We're gearing up.

1648
01:10:11,713 --> 01:10:13,014
我不会接受的.
I wouldn't take that.

1649
01:10:13,147 --> 01:10:14,683
那些东西会把你的裤子扯下来.
Those things rip your pants right off.

1650
01:10:14,816 --> 01:10:16,518
呵呵.试着穿干净的内衣.
Huh. Try wearing clean underwear.

1651
01:10:16,651 --> 01:10:18,453
以防万一.
Just in case.

1652
01:10:19,421 --> 01:10:20,555
什么...
Wha...

1653
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:24,158
你偷了我的车？
You stole my car?

1654
01:10:24,293 --> 01:10:25,560
尊敬
Respect.

1655
01:10:25,694 --> 01:10:28,330
-我们开始吧-（发动机转速、轮胎吱吱声）
-Let's do this. -(engine revs, tires squeal)

1656
01:10:37,472 --> 01:10:39,641
-（电梯铃响）-（所有人都喘着粗气）
-(elevator bell dings) -(all gasp)

1657
01:10:39,774 --> 01:10:40,775
-不-什么
-No! -What?

1658
01:10:40,909 --> 01:10:42,277
我们所有的东西？
All our stuff?

1659
01:10:43,077 --> 01:10:44,579
-一切都在哪里-不，不，不，不，不.
-Where is everything? -No, no, no, no, no.

1660
01:10:44,713 --> 01:10:46,381
-不，不，不，不，不，不，不，不-我们所有的东西.
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! -All our stuff.

1661
01:10:46,515 --> 01:10:48,283
-都没了-我的伪装柜！
-It's all gone. -My disguise closet!

1662
01:10:48,417 --> 01:10:50,652
-狼蛛：我的东西呢-（衣架叮当作响）
-TARANTULA: Where's my things? -(hangers clanging)

1663
01:10:51,753 --> 01:10:54,022
狼把我们所有的战利品都给了我们.
Wolf gave away all our loot.

1664
01:10:54,155 --> 01:10:56,458
我们把它偷走了.
We stole it fair and square.

1665
01:10:56,591 --> 01:10:58,593
现在我明白这是什么感觉了
Now I understand what it feels like

1666
01:10:58,727 --> 01:11:01,363
把你的东西偷走.（颤抖的呼吸）
to have things stolen from you. (shuddering breaths)

1667
01:11:01,496 --> 01:11:03,197
我不喜欢！
I don't like it!

1668
01:11:03,332 --> 01:11:06,034
我真的不喜欢！（呜咽）
I really don't like it! (whimpers)

1669
01:11:09,804 --> 01:11:11,406
-（呻吟）-（鲨鱼哭泣）
-(groans) -(Shark sobbing)

1670
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:14,042
鲨鱼：我们没有食物.我们没有钱.
SHARK: We got no food. We got no money.

1671
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:15,577
我们没有钱可以用来买食物.
We got no money we could use to buy food.

1672
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:17,679
我们卖不到能赚钱的食物.（咕哝）
No food we can sell for money. (grunts)

1673
01:11:17,812 --> 01:11:19,881
我们（抽泣）
We... (sobs)

1674
01:11:20,014 --> 01:11:22,083
好吧，好吧，好吧.
All right, okay, okay.

1675
01:11:22,216 --> 01:11:24,486
这里，这里.拿去吧.
Here, here. Take it.

1676
01:11:24,619 --> 01:11:26,655
别哭了，伙计.
Now, stop crying, buddy.

1677
01:11:26,788 --> 01:11:28,490
（叹息）
(sighs)

1678
01:11:29,358 --> 01:11:33,995
斯内克，你刚才做了什么？
Um, Snake, what did you just do?

1679
01:11:34,128 --> 01:11:35,797
什么我的朋友很伤心.
What? My friend was sad.

1680
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:37,366
我只是在给他加油.
I was just cheering him up.

1681
01:11:37,499 --> 01:11:39,868
你你做了一件好事.
You... you did a good thing.

1682
01:11:40,001 --> 01:11:41,870
-对我来说-别傻了.
-For me. -Don't be ridiculous.

1683
01:11:42,003 --> 01:11:44,205
我只是把你的需要放在我自己的需要之前.
I just put your needs before my own.

1684
01:11:44,339 --> 01:11:46,708
-对.你表现得很好-我不是.
-Yeah. You're being good. -I'm not.

1685
01:11:46,841 --> 01:11:49,744
我只是为了让鲨鱼开心而做出牺牲.
I was simply making a sacrifice so Shark could be happy.

1686
01:11:49,878 --> 01:11:52,881
这就是“好”的实际定义.
That is the actual definition of being good.

1687
01:11:53,014 --> 01:11:54,916
斯内克，你，
Snake, you,

1688
01:11:55,049 --> 01:11:57,151
我们中最坏的一个，最自私的一个.
the worst one of us, the most selfish.

1689
01:11:57,285 --> 01:11:58,753
-恶毒的-可怕的
-Spiteful. -Terrible.

1690
01:11:58,887 --> 01:11:59,988
-鬼鬼祟祟的-不诚实的.
-Sneaky. -Dishonest.

1691
01:12:00,121 --> 01:12:01,155
-麻木不仁-善于操纵的
-Insensitive. -Manipulative.

1692
01:12:01,289 --> 01:12:02,657
-蛇形的-斯坦基.
-Snakelike. -Stanky.

1693
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:04,693
你的意思是？
And your point is?

1694
01:12:04,826 --> 01:12:06,595
我认为沃尔夫是对的.
I think Wolf was right.

1695
01:12:06,728 --> 01:12:09,731
也许我们不只是可怕的恶棍.
Maybe we could be more than just scary villains.

1696
01:12:10,732 --> 01:12:12,233
（喘息）
(gasps)

1697
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:14,202
什么...？
Wh...?

1698
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,037
狼蛛：哦，哇.
TARANTULA: Oh, wow.

1699
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:18,673
这是...这是摇摆吗？
Is this... is this wagging?

1700
01:12:19,674 --> 01:12:21,342
我们在摇摆.
We're-we're wagging.

1701
01:12:21,476 --> 01:12:23,011
（咕哝）
(grunting)

1702
01:12:23,144 --> 01:12:25,847
不，不，不！
No, no, no!

1703
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:30,084
我们永远都是坏人！
We'll always be Bad Guys!

1704
01:12:36,157 --> 01:12:38,393
（喘息）
(panting)

1705
01:12:41,463 --> 01:12:43,898
（电爆裂声）
(electrical crackling)

1706
01:12:44,032 --> 01:12:47,101
-（男人尖叫）-（吱吱嘎吱的咯咯声）
-(man yelps) -(squeaky chittering)

1707
01:12:52,941 --> 01:12:55,877
（狂笑）
(laughing maniacally)

1708
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:58,447
快点，快点，我的小猪.
Faster, faster, my little pigs.

1709
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:00,449
（欢呼声）
(cheering)

1710
01:13:03,184 --> 01:13:05,086
-（砰砰）-（轮胎吱吱作响）
-(thumping) -(tires squeal)

1711
01:13:05,854 --> 01:13:07,656
（喘息）
(all gasp)

1712
01:13:07,789 --> 01:13:08,657
（闲聊）
(chittering)

1713
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:10,391
（司机尖叫）
(driver screams)

1714
01:13:10,525 --> 01:13:13,428
-（呻吟）-（轮胎尖叫）
-(groans) -(tires squeal)

1715
01:13:14,128 --> 01:13:15,063
（哭泣）
(crying)

1716
01:13:15,196 --> 01:13:16,531
（笑）
(laughing)

1717
01:13:16,665 --> 01:13:17,732
（欢呼声）
(cheering)

1718
01:13:17,866 --> 01:13:18,867
（咯咯笑）
(chuckles)

1719
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,602
-（尖叫）-（司机尖叫）
-(squeaks) -(driver yelps)

1720
01:13:21,636 --> 01:13:22,804
（司机尖叫）
(driver screams)

1721
01:13:25,707 --> 01:13:28,109
-（司机尖叫）-（轮胎尖叫）
-(drivers scream) -(tires squeal)

1722
01:13:28,242 --> 01:13:30,344
（吱吱嘎吱的闲聊）
(squeaky chittering)

1723
01:13:32,447 --> 01:13:35,116
-（人们尖叫）-（爆炸声）
-(people screaming) -(explosion booms)

1724
01:13:40,221 --> 01:13:42,123
（轮胎吱吱作响）
(tires squeal)

1725
01:13:42,256 --> 01:13:44,025
一旦我们偷了陨石，
Once we steal the meteorite,

1726
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:45,894
我们直接报警.
we take it straight to the police.

1727
01:13:46,027 --> 01:13:47,629
一切都会被原谅.
And all will be forgiven.

1728
01:13:47,762 --> 01:13:51,199
我不知道“全部”，但这只是个开始.
I don't know about "all," but it's a start.

1729
01:14:01,943 --> 01:14:04,245
（门开了）
(door opens)

1730
01:14:10,451 --> 01:14:11,920
真奇怪.
That's strange.

1731
01:14:12,053 --> 01:14:15,156
为什么果酱会让金海豚不受保护？
Why would Marmalade leave the Golden Dolphin unprotected?

1732
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:18,159
-因为这可能是个陷阱-或者也许...
-Because maybe it's a trap. -Or maybe...

1733
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:20,428
-等等，等等，等等-（呻吟）
-Wait, wait, wait! -(groans)

1734
01:14:21,195 --> 01:14:22,330
是的，那是个陷阱.
Yeah, it was a trap.

1735
01:14:22,463 --> 01:14:23,898
果酱：好吧，好吧，好吧.
MARMALADE: Well, well, well.

1736
01:14:24,032 --> 01:14:26,501
如果不是我的宝贝学生.
If it isn't my prized pupil.

1737
01:14:26,635 --> 01:14:28,703
你还带来了州长.
And you've brought along the governor.

1738
01:14:28,837 --> 01:14:30,171
或者我应该说...
Or should I say...

1739
01:14:30,304 --> 01:14:31,773
-深红色的爪子-（喘息、咕哝）
-the Crimson Paw? -(gasps, grunts)

1740
01:14:31,906 --> 01:14:36,711
嗯，这是一个多么巧妙的伪装尊邦钻石的方法，
Mm, what an ingenious way to disguise a Zumpango diamond,

1741
01:14:36,845 --> 01:14:39,047
把它藏在显眼的地方.
hiding it in plain sight.

1742
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:41,149
你开玩笑吧.
You got to be kidding me.

1743
01:14:41,282 --> 01:14:43,017
什么我多愁善感.
What? I'm sentimental.

1744
01:14:43,151 --> 01:14:44,653
你总是很有气派.
You always did have panache.

1745
01:14:44,786 --> 01:14:47,689
然而，你还是掉进了我的陷阱.
And yet, you still fell right into my trap.

1746
01:14:47,822 --> 01:14:50,058
但你怎么知道我们会在这里？
But how did you know we'd even be here?

1747
01:14:50,191 --> 01:14:53,227
哦，我从一个朋友那里得到了一点提示.
Oh, I got a little tip from a friend.

1748
01:14:53,361 --> 01:14:54,729
-（门开了）-（嘶嘶声）
-(door opens) -(hissing)

1749
01:14:54,863 --> 01:14:56,164
嘿，伙计.
Hey, buddy.

1750
01:14:56,297 --> 01:14:57,599
挂起来怎么样？
How's it hanging?

1751
01:14:57,732 --> 01:15:00,234
-蛇-（蛇笑了）
-Snake. -(Snake chuckles)

1752
01:15:00,368 --> 01:15:02,103
我能说什么？我们只是点击了一下.
What can I say? We just clicked.

1753
01:15:02,236 --> 01:15:05,907
哦，是吗？为你最喜欢的食物工作感觉如何？
Oh, yeah? How's it feel to be working for your favorite food?

1754
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,942
啊，你只是嫉妒
Ah, you're just jealous

1755
01:15:08,076 --> 01:15:10,344
错过了本世纪的抢劫案.
to be missing out on the heist of the century.

1756
01:15:10,478 --> 01:15:12,146
它拥有一切：
It's got everything:

1757
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:15,183
背叛，流星，精神控制.
betrayal, a meteor, mind control.

* We're only here to make you, we're only here to make you *

1894
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:26,427
-*开始.*-（歌曲结尾）
-* Go. * -(song ends)

1895
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,496
-头儿-这最好是好的.
-Chief. -This better be good.

1896
01:20:28,629 --> 01:20:30,999
相信我，你不会想错过的.
Trust me, you don't want to miss this.

1897
01:20:31,132 --> 01:20:32,300
（喘息）看.
(gasps) Look.

1898
01:20:32,433 --> 01:20:33,601
（轮胎吱吱作响）
(tires squealing)

1899
01:20:33,734 --> 01:20:35,603
给我的小面包涂黄油.
Well, butter my crumpets.

1900
01:20:35,736 --> 01:20:36,971
蒂芙尼：会吗？
TIFFANY: Can it be?

1901
01:20:37,105 --> 01:20:39,340
坏人要归还陨石？
The Bad Guys are returning the meteorite?

1902
01:20:39,473 --> 01:20:42,676
（通过广播）：也许这是我们都需要的感觉良好的故事.
(over radio): Perhaps this is the feel-good story we all need.

1903
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:44,145
-呜呜！是啊-呜呜-好吧
-Woo-hoo! Yeah! -Woo-hoo! -All right!

1904
01:20:44,278 --> 01:20:46,047
你们觉得他们会给我们开派对吗？
Do you guys think they'll throw us a party?

1905
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:49,717
是 啊有烟火、馅饼和蛋糕.
Yeah. With fireworks, piñatas and cake.

1906
01:20:55,256 --> 01:20:57,926
（轮胎吱吱作响）
(tires squeal)

1907
01:21:03,297 --> 01:21:05,133
（叹息）
(sighs)

1908
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:08,202
没有他我们做不到.
We can't do this without him.

1909
01:21:09,003 --> 01:21:10,871
他可能是个脾气暴躁的先生...
He might be a Mr. Grumpy Pants...

1910
01:21:11,005 --> 01:21:13,507
但他是我们的暴躁先生.
But he's our Mr. Grumpy Pants.

1911
01:21:13,641 --> 01:21:16,244
-对-（发动机转速）
-Yeah. -(engine revs)

1912
01:21:17,578 --> 01:21:18,947
狼
Wolf!

1913
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,983
我开始明白为什么你的朋友甩了你.
I'm starting to see why your friends dumped you.

1914
01:21:22,116 --> 01:21:24,285
-我没有朋友-（喇叭声）
-I don't have any friends! -(horn honking)

1915
01:21:24,418 --> 01:21:26,988
狼：蛇！蛇
WOLF: Snake! Snake!

1916
01:21:27,121 --> 01:21:28,389
狼
Wolf?

1917
01:21:28,522 --> 01:21:29,757
蛇，回来！
Snake, come back!

1918
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:31,392
我们需要你，宝贝！
We need you, baby!

1919
01:21:31,525 --> 01:21:32,961
你需要我们！
And you need us!

1920
01:21:33,094 --> 01:21:37,065
哦，你又来了，把它变成私人的.
Oh, there you go again, making it personal.

1921
01:21:37,198 --> 01:21:40,001
我给你最后一次机会把陨石给我.
I'll give you one last chance to give me the meteorite.

1922
01:21:40,134 --> 01:21:43,071
哦，是吗？你要怎么做，胡子？
Oh, yeah? What you gonna do, Whiskers?

1923
01:21:43,938 --> 01:21:45,406
-这个-（设备呼呼作响）
-This. -(device whirring)

1924
01:21:45,539 --> 01:21:46,540
-（隆隆声）-（喘息声）
-(rumbling) -(gasping)

1925
01:21:46,674 --> 01:21:48,309
什么...？
What the...?

1926
01:21:52,846 --> 01:21:54,315
-（叽叽喳喳）-（鲨鱼喘息）
-(chittering) -(Shark gasps)

1927
01:21:54,448 --> 01:21:55,549
我们有可爱的同伴.
We've got adorable company.

1928
01:21:55,683 --> 01:21:57,718
趴下！
Floor it!

1929
01:22:02,156 --> 01:22:03,691
哇！
Whoa!

1930
01:22:06,094 --> 01:22:08,329
也许我不该叫他胡子.
Maybe I shouldn't have called him Whiskers.

1931
01:22:10,598 --> 01:22:12,833
（都在尖叫）
(all screaming)

1932
01:22:15,736 --> 01:22:17,005
今天早上我醒来的时候，
When I woke up this morning,

1933
01:22:17,138 --> 01:22:19,473
这不是我今天看到的.
this is not where I saw the day going.

1934
01:22:19,607 --> 01:22:21,842
（都在大喊大叫）
(all yelling, grunting)

1935
01:22:22,910 --> 01:22:24,112
狼：来吧.
WOLF: Come on.

1936
01:22:24,245 --> 01:22:25,113
（尖叫）
(screaming)

1937
01:22:25,246 --> 01:22:26,747
哇，哇，哇，哇.
SNAKE: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1938
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,749
嘿，嘿，让我们把这个调低一点，好吗？
Hey, hey, let's dial this down a notch, huh?

1939
01:22:28,882 --> 01:22:30,551
再说，你永远也抓不到他.
Besides, you'll never get him.

1940
01:22:30,684 --> 01:22:32,586
他是个很好的司机.
He's too good a driver.

1941
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,188
嗯，你说得对.
Hmm. You're right.

1942
01:22:34,322 --> 01:22:36,757
但现在我想起来了，也许会更好
But now that I think of it, maybe it would be better

1943
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:38,526
利用他最大的弱点.
to exploit his greatest weakness.

1944
01:22:38,659 --> 01:22:40,461
确切地
Exactly.

1945
01:22:40,594 --> 01:22:42,930
等待（尖叫声）
Wait. (screams)

1946
01:22:43,064 --> 01:22:44,798
（喘息）
(gasps)

1947
01:22:45,933 --> 01:22:47,901
哇，哇，哇，哇，哇，哇，哇.等等
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

1948
01:22:48,036 --> 01:22:49,637
-等等，等等，等等-（笑）
-Hold it, hold it, hold it. -(laughing)

1949
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:51,472
好的，好的.你赢了.
Okay, okay. You win.

1950
01:22:51,605 --> 01:22:53,307
你可以拥有太空石.
You can have the space rock.

1951
01:22:53,441 --> 01:22:54,808
好孩子，狼.
Good boy, Wolf.

1952
01:22:54,942 --> 01:22:56,377
（设备呼呼作响）
(device whirring)

1953
01:23:04,985 --> 01:23:06,487
狼：开车.
WOLF: Take the wheel.

1954
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:07,788
没那么快.
Not so fast.

1955
01:23:07,921 --> 01:23:11,225
先把他拉上来，不然我就用这个.
Pull him up first, or I'll use this.

1956
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:13,161
哦，来吧.
Oh, come now.

1957
01:23:15,496 --> 01:23:17,098
（咯咯笑）
(chuckling)

1958
01:23:17,231 --> 01:23:19,933
去做吧，否则你会失去那块石头的.
Do it, or you'll lose the rock.

1959
01:23:20,968 --> 01:23:22,403
如果你坚持的话.
If you insist.

1960
01:23:22,536 --> 01:23:23,904
拥抱！
Cuddles!

1961
01:23:30,844 --> 01:23:33,281
你想要他？他是你的.
You want him? He's yours.

1962
01:23:33,414 --> 01:23:35,416
（咕噜声、喊声）
(grunts, yells)

1963
01:23:35,549 --> 01:23:37,351
（尖叫）
(screaming)

1964
01:23:37,485 --> 01:23:39,587
蛇不，不，不！
Snake! No, no, no!

1965
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:41,589
-蛇-哦，不！
-Snake! -Oh, no!

1966
01:23:41,722 --> 01:23:43,424
（发动机转速）
(engine revs)

1967
01:23:50,798 --> 01:23:53,201
（尖叫）
(screaming)

1968
01:23:54,835 --> 01:23:57,471
伙计们，我知道这很疯狂，但我们要跳下去.
Guys, I know it's crazy, but we're gonna jump it.

1969
01:23:57,605 --> 01:24:00,474
疯子你终于能说我的语言了，奇科.
Crazy? You're finally speaking my language, chico.

1970
01:24:00,608 --> 01:24:03,043
（发动机转速）
(engine revving)

1971
01:24:10,784 --> 01:24:14,054
我们会成功的！
We're gonna make it!

1972
01:24:14,955 --> 01:24:16,224
狼蛛：不！
TARANTULA: No!

1973
01:24:16,357 --> 01:24:19,460
（都在尖叫）
(all screaming)

1974
01:24:19,593 --> 01:24:21,395
（风呼啸）
(wind whistling)

1975
01:24:21,529 --> 01:24:23,231
你回来了.
You came back.

1976
01:24:24,232 --> 01:24:26,033
（咕哝）
(grunting)

1977
01:24:26,167 --> 01:24:27,235
蛇
Snake.

1978
01:24:27,368 --> 01:24:28,736
我应该对你说实话.
I should've been honest with you.

1979
01:24:28,869 --> 01:24:30,070
我担心如果你知道
I was afraid that if you knew

1980
01:24:30,204 --> 01:24:31,839
我想表现得很好，你...
I-I wanted to be good that you'd...

1981
01:24:31,972 --> 01:24:34,875
表现得像个混蛋，再也不和你说话了？
Act like a jerk and never talk to you again?

1982
01:24:35,008 --> 01:24:36,677
（笑）：是的.
(laughing): Yeah.

1983
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:38,779
重点是我...我，我，你知道...
Point is I... I-I-I, you know...

1984
01:24:38,912 --> 01:24:41,482
是 啊我也爱你，伙计.
Yeah. I love you, too, buddy.

1985
01:24:45,719 --> 01:24:47,388
这太美了.
This-this is so beautiful.

1986
01:24:47,521 --> 01:24:49,923
你们知道这有多美吗？
Do you know how beautiful this is, you guys?

1987
01:24:50,057 --> 01:24:51,159
-（鲨鱼哭泣）-现在...
-(Shark sobbing) -Now...

1988
01:24:51,292 --> 01:24:52,993
现在你要让我哭了.
Now you're gonna make me cry.

1989
01:24:53,127 --> 01:24:54,628
我知道！
(sobbing): I know!

1990
01:24:54,762 --> 01:24:56,230
真可怜，对吧？
So pathetic, right?

1991
01:24:56,364 --> 01:24:58,299
来吧，伙计们.
Come on, guys.

1992
01:24:58,432 --> 01:25:00,100
谁说结束了？
Who said it was the end?

1993
01:25:00,234 --> 01:25:01,502
-（喘息）-（鲨鱼咯咯笑）
-(all gasp) -(Shark chuckles)

1994
01:25:04,037 --> 01:25:06,274
（所有的叫声、笑声）
(all whooping, laughing)

1995
01:25:10,578 --> 01:25:12,280
（闲聊）
(chittering)

1996
01:25:13,947 --> 01:25:15,916
果酱：不，不，不，不要...不，不，拥抱！
MARMALADE: No, no, no, don't... No, no. Cuddles!

1997
01:25:16,049 --> 01:25:17,685
我们正在失去高度！
We're losing altitude!

1998
01:25:17,818 --> 01:25:20,020
我们正在失去高度！我们要下去了！
We're losing altitude! We're going down!

1999
01:25:24,725 --> 01:25:26,194
（呻吟、咳嗽）
(groans, coughs)

2000
01:25:26,327 --> 01:25:28,229
怎么搞的？我们爆炸了吗？
What happened? Did we blow up?

2001
01:25:28,362 --> 01:25:30,298
这是天堂吗？
Is this heaven?

2002
01:25:32,333 --> 01:25:34,368
（咕哝）
(grunting)

2003
01:25:39,139 --> 01:25:41,008
警长（笑）：就是这样.
CHIEF (chuckles): That is it.

2004
01:25:41,141 --> 01:25:42,643
食人鱼：嘿！
PIRANHA: Hey!

2005
01:25:42,776 --> 01:25:45,813
这次你绝对逃不掉.
There is absolutely no way you're getting away this time.

2006
01:25:45,946 --> 01:25:47,848
-等等，警长-福辛顿州长？
-Wait, Chief. -Governor Foxington?

2007
01:25:47,981 --> 01:25:49,183
-不要这样做-狼：噢！
-Don't do this. -WOLF: Ow!

2008
01:25:49,317 --> 01:25:50,618
他们没有偷陨石.
They didn't steal the meteorite.

2009
01:25:50,751 --> 01:25:51,919
他们要把它带回来.
They were bringing it back.

2010
01:25:52,052 --> 01:25:54,054
哈你怎么知道的？
Ha! How could you know that?

2011
01:25:54,188 --> 01:25:57,090
除非除非你在密谋
Unless... unless you were conspiring

2012
01:25:57,225 --> 01:25:59,827
和一群已知的罪犯在一起.
with a bunch of known criminals.

2013
01:26:00,761 --> 01:26:02,696
好（清嗓子）
Well... (clears throat)

2014
01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:05,199
事实上，事实上，
as a matter of fact,

2015
01:26:05,333 --> 01:26:07,568
该是我坦白的时候了.
it's time I came clean about something.

2016
01:26:08,369 --> 01:26:11,672
事实是我真的...（清嗓子）真的...
The truth is I'm really... (clears throat) r-really...

2017
01:26:11,805 --> 01:26:14,275
真的很喜欢救赎弧.
Really a big fan of redemption arcs.

2018
01:26:14,408 --> 01:26:16,143
是的，我们知道.
Yeah, we know.

2019
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:21,449
（喵喵）
(mews)

2020
01:26:21,582 --> 01:26:22,816
我们跑完了.
We're done running away.

2021
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:23,917
-对-嗯.
-Yeah. -Mm-hmm.

2022
01:26:24,051 --> 01:26:25,753
-对-是的.
-Yeah. -Yep.

2023
01:26:25,886 --> 01:26:27,755
警长，做你该做的.
Chief, do what you need to do.

2024
01:26:27,888 --> 01:26:28,989
什么
What?

2025
01:26:29,122 --> 01:26:31,892
你要自首吗？
Y-You're turning yourself in?

2026
01:26:32,025 --> 01:26:33,827
我们可能没偷陨石，
We might not have stolen the meteorite,

2027
01:26:33,961 --> 01:26:36,297
但我们确实偷了很多其他东西.
but we did steal a lot of other things.

2028
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:38,832
该是我们承担责任的时候了.
It's time we took some responsibility.

2029
01:26:38,966 --> 01:26:41,134
开始一个干净的状态.
Start a clean state.

2030
01:26:41,935 --> 01:26:43,871
带我们进去，头儿.
Take us in, Chief.

2031
01:26:44,672 --> 01:26:46,106
哇，真的吗？
Wow, really?

2032
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:47,541
你终于做到了.
You finally did it.

2033
01:26:47,675 --> 01:26:48,876
这是你的时刻，警长.
This is your moment, Chief.

2034
01:26:49,009 --> 01:26:50,244
喝进去.
Drink it in.

2035
01:26:50,378 --> 01:26:51,512
（喘息）哇.
(gasps) Wow.

2036
01:26:51,645 --> 01:26:52,980
你知道，我应该...我应该发表演讲.
You know, I should... I should give a speech.

2037
01:26:53,113 --> 01:26:54,248
我我应该，不是吗？
I... Well, I-I should, shouldn't I?

2038
01:26:54,382 --> 01:26:56,083
-呃...（咕哝）-（局长清嗓子）
-Uh... (mutters) -(chief clears throat)

2039
01:26:56,216 --> 01:26:57,518
我六岁的时候，
When I was six years old,

2040
01:26:57,651 --> 01:26:59,287
我决定玩短笛，
I decided that I wanted to play the piccolo,

2041
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:01,255
却发现我的手指
only to find that my fingers were just

2042
01:27:01,389 --> 01:27:04,091
对那个脆弱的小仪器来说太强大了.
too powerful for that fragile little instrument.

2043
01:27:04,224 --> 01:27:06,694
就在那时我发现了执法.
And that's when I discovered law enforcement.

2044
01:27:06,827 --> 01:27:08,228
-（咯咯笑）-（酋长含糊不清地继续说）
-(chuckles) -(chief continues indistinctly)

2045
01:27:08,362 --> 01:27:10,030
我为你感到骄傲，沃尔夫.
I'm proud of you, Wolf.

2046
01:27:10,163 --> 01:27:13,367
你知道，狐狸和狼没什么不同.
You know, a fox and a wolf are not that different.

2047
01:27:13,501 --> 01:27:15,436
州长，你有一件好事要做.
You got a good thing going here, Governor.

2048
01:27:15,569 --> 01:27:17,705
所以，原来是坏人的传奇故事
So, it turns out the saga of the Bad Guys

2049
01:27:17,838 --> 01:27:21,342
得出了一个简单且完全令人满意的结论.
has come to a simple and totally satisfying conclusion.

2050
01:27:21,475 --> 01:27:24,177
虽然我想知道，陨石怎么了？
Though I wonder, what happened to the meteorite?

2051
01:27:24,312 --> 01:27:26,113
果酱：拥抱！快点，快点！
MARMALADE: Cuddles! Faster, faster!

2052
01:27:26,246 --> 01:27:27,815
蒂芙尼：是果酱教授！
TIFFANY: It's Professor Marmalade!

2053
01:27:27,948 --> 01:27:30,050
他要把陨石带回来.
He's bringing the meteorite back.

2054
01:27:30,183 --> 01:27:32,686
-嗯？嗯，是的，是的-（人群喧嚣）
-Huh? Uh, yes, yes. -(crowd clamoring)

2055
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,688
带来...把它带回来.
Bringing... bringing it back.

2056
01:27:34,822 --> 01:27:36,557
这正是我正在做的.
That's precisely what I am doing.

2057
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:41,895
别再看了.
Look no further.

2058
01:27:42,029 --> 01:27:44,197
你的英雄来了.
Your hero has arrived.

2059
01:27:44,332 --> 01:27:45,766
教授，有什么评论吗？
Professor, care to comment?

2060
01:27:45,899 --> 01:27:47,535
我试着帮他们Tiffany，
I tried to help them, Tiffany,

2061
01:27:47,668 --> 01:27:50,338
但最后，还是老故事.
but in the end, it's the same old story.

2062
01:27:50,471 --> 01:27:53,374
坏人坏人坏人好人好人.
Bad guys bad, good guys good.

2063
01:27:53,507 --> 01:27:55,008
真的.太聪明了.
So true. So wise.

2064
01:27:55,142 --> 01:27:56,577
此外，为了城市的利益，
Furthermore, for the good of the city,

2065
01:27:56,710 --> 01:27:59,212
我已经慷慨地决定接受这块陨石
I have generously decided to take the meteorite

2066
01:27:59,347 --> 01:28:02,049
回到我的院子里保管.
back to my compound for safekeeping.

2067
01:28:02,182 --> 01:28:03,451
（欢呼声）
(cheering)

2068
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,185
他真的要逍遥法外吗？
Is he seriously gonna get away with this?

2069
01:28:05,319 --> 01:28:07,855
非常感谢.天哪，你真好.
Thank you. Gosh, you're kind.

2070
01:28:07,988 --> 01:28:09,790
为我放弃吧！
Give it up for me!

2071
01:28:09,923 --> 01:28:11,258
主任：等一下.
CHIEF: Wait a second.

2072
01:28:11,392 --> 01:28:13,060
这不是陨石.
This isn't the meteorite.

2073
01:28:13,193 --> 01:28:14,762
-这是一盏灯-（橘子酱喘息）
-It's a lamp. -(Marmalade gasps)

2074
01:28:14,895 --> 01:28:16,029
大家：嗯？
ALL: Huh?

2075
01:28:16,163 --> 01:28:17,631
-其他人：什么？
-(Snake chuckling) -OTHERS: What?

2076
01:28:17,765 --> 01:28:19,933
狼蛛：蛇，你刚才做了什么？
TARANTULA: Snake, what did you just do?

2077
01:28:20,067 --> 01:28:21,769
什么？我朋友很伤心，
SNAKE: What? My friend was sad,

2078
01:28:21,902 --> 01:28:23,036
我只是在鼓励他.
and I was just cheering him up.

2079
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:24,672
狼蛛：我认为狼是对的.
TARANTULA: I think Wolf was right.

2080
01:28:24,805 --> 01:28:27,941
也许我们不只是可怕的恶棍.
Maybe we could be more than just scary villains.

2081
01:28:31,111 --> 01:28:32,680
我很坏.你很坏.
I'm bad. You're bad.

2082
01:28:32,813 --> 01:28:34,147
让我们一起变坏吧.
Let's be bad together.

2083
01:28:34,281 --> 01:28:36,517
你已经达成协议了.
You've got yourself a deal.

2084
01:28:38,018 --> 01:28:40,888
-我能试穿一下吗-当然，搭档.
-Can I try it on? -Of course, partner.

2085
01:28:55,536 --> 01:28:57,237
-（橘子酱喘息）-别介意我们.
-(Marmalade gasps) -Don't mind us.

2086
01:28:57,371 --> 01:28:58,739
只是抢劫这个地方.
Just robbing this place.

2087
01:28:58,872 --> 01:29:01,008
（发动机转速、轮胎吱吱声）
(engine revs, tires squeal)

2088
01:29:03,043 --> 01:29:05,045
不，不，不！
No, no, no!

2089
01:29:08,749 --> 01:29:10,518
但如果那是一盏灯，那么...
But if that's a lamp, where is the...

2090
01:29:10,651 --> 01:29:11,652
（蛇咯咯地笑）
(Snake chuckling)

2091
01:29:11,785 --> 01:29:13,020
那个老开关.
The old switcheroo.

2092
01:29:13,153 --> 01:29:14,555
（呼呼、隆隆）
(whirring, rumbling)

2093
01:29:15,523 --> 01:29:17,691
-（爆炸性的嗖嗖声）-（警官们喘着粗气）
-(explosive whooshing) -(officers gasp)

2094
01:29:24,031 --> 01:29:26,233
（风声）
(wind whistles)

2095
01:29:34,508 --> 01:29:36,710
-（汽车发动机启动）-（呼噜声）
-(car engine starts) -(purring)

2096
01:29:38,245 --> 01:29:40,648
（警报声）
(siren wailing)

2097
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:44,518
是屁股.
It's a butt.

2098
01:29:45,352 --> 01:29:47,588
（物体在空中呼啸）
(object whistling through air)

2099
01:29:48,856 --> 01:29:50,190
（呜咽）
(whimpers)

2100
01:29:51,291 --> 01:29:52,493
警长：等等.
CHIEF: Hold on.

2101
01:29:52,626 --> 01:29:54,895
这是尊邦戈钻石.
This is the Zumpango diamond.

2102
01:29:55,028 --> 01:29:56,830
但这是被...
But this was stolen by the...

2103
01:29:56,964 --> 01:29:58,331
（喘息）
(gasps)

2104
01:29:58,466 --> 01:30:00,868
用深红色的爪子.
By the Crimson Paw.

2105
01:30:01,001 --> 01:30:02,402
我哦，哦，不，不，不.
Me? Oh, oh, no, no, no.

2106
01:30:02,536 --> 01:30:04,304
-天哪-果酱：不，不，不.不，你弄错了.
-OMG. -MARMALADE: No, no, no. No, you've got it wrong.

2107
01:30:04,438 --> 01:30:06,273
-一个令人震惊的转折-你犯了个大错！
-And a shocking twist. -You're making a huge mistake!

2108
01:30:06,406 --> 01:30:09,677
臭名昭著的土匪被称为深红色爪子
The notorious bandit known as the Crimson Paw

2109
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:11,411
-据透露是-不不
-has been revealed to be... -No! No!

2110
01:30:11,545 --> 01:30:13,080
...不是别人，正是Marmalade教授.
...none other than Professor Marmalade.

2111
01:30:13,213 --> 01:30:14,448
果酱：我不是深红色的爪子.
MARMALADE: I'm not the Crimson Paw.

2112
01:30:14,582 --> 01:30:16,216
-她是深红色的爪子-（警报声哀鸣）
-Sh-She's the Crimson Paw. -(sirens wailing)

2113
01:30:16,349 --> 01:30:17,918
嘘，她是爪子！
Sh-She's the Paw!

2114
01:30:18,051 --> 01:30:20,053
我是善良之花.不
I'm a flower of goodness. No!

2115
01:30:20,187 --> 01:30:22,255
哦！那是我的爬行动物.
Ooh! That's my reptile right there.

2116
01:30:22,389 --> 01:30:24,124
-这就是我说的！好吧-是 啊
-That's what I'm talking about! All right! -Yeah!

2117
01:30:24,257 --> 01:30:26,393
拜托，总得有人摧毁那颗陨石.
Come on, somebody had to destroy that meteorite.

2118
01:30:26,527 --> 01:30:28,361
那东西很危险.
That thing was dangerous.

2119
01:30:28,496 --> 01:30:30,363
很好，斯纳基.
That was pretty good there, Snakey.

2120
01:30:30,498 --> 01:30:32,733
好的这是天才.
Good? It was genius.

2121
01:30:32,866 --> 01:30:34,568
我不仅挫败了猪，
Not only did I foil the pig,

2122
01:30:34,702 --> 01:30:37,237
我让你承认你有多在乎我.
I got you to admit how much you care about me.

2123
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:38,639
当然可以.
Sure, yeah.

2124
01:30:38,772 --> 01:30:40,373
我只是想知道一件小事.
I just wonder about one little thing.

2125
01:30:40,508 --> 01:30:41,909
哦，是吗？那是什么，狼？
Oh, yeah? What's that, Wolf?

2126
01:30:42,042 --> 01:30:46,246
你觉得是谁把那瓶汽水放进冰箱的？
Who do you think put that one Push Pop in the fridge?

2127
01:30:47,681 --> 01:30:48,982
等待
Wait.

2128
01:30:49,116 --> 01:30:50,651
你不
You... No.

2129
01:30:50,784 --> 01:30:52,119
我就知道你很好.
I knew you were good.

2130
01:30:52,252 --> 01:30:54,522
-（笑声）-不.
-(laughter) -No.

2131
01:30:54,655 --> 01:30:57,457
-我们很好，宝贝.我们很好-是 啊
-We good, baby. We good. -Yeah!

2132
01:30:57,591 --> 01:31:00,594
*你感觉还好吗*
* You feelin' all right? *

2133
01:31:00,728 --> 01:31:02,630
*嗯哼*
* Uh-huh *

2134
01:31:02,763 --> 01:31:06,166
*我自己感觉不太好*
* I'm not feelin' too good myself *

2135
01:31:06,299 --> 01:31:08,468
*嗯哼*
* Uh-huh *

2136
01:31:08,602 --> 01:31:11,939
*是的，你感觉还好吗*
* Yeah, you feelin' all right? *

2137
01:31:12,072 --> 01:31:13,607
*嗯哼*
* Uh-huh *

2138
01:31:13,741 --> 01:31:17,077
*我感觉不太好，小女孩*
* I'm not feelin' too good, little girl *

2139
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:19,446
*嗯哼*
* Uh-huh *

2140
01:31:20,981 --> 01:31:23,050
*看来我必须*
* Seems I've got to have *

2141
01:31:23,183 --> 01:31:26,319
*场景的改变*
* A change of scene *

2142
01:31:26,453 --> 01:31:28,522
*每天晚上，我都有*
* Every night, I have *

2143
01:31:28,656 --> 01:31:30,724
*最奇怪的梦*
* The strangest dreams *

2144
01:31:31,692 --> 01:31:34,127
*顺便说一句*
* Imprisoned by the way *

2145
01:31:34,261 --> 01:31:36,764
*可能是*
* It could have been *

2146
01:31:38,031 --> 01:31:39,299
*我一个人留在这里*
* Left here on my own *

2147
01:31:39,432 --> 01:31:41,769
*或者看起来*
* Or so it seems... *

2148
01:31:41,902 --> 01:31:44,304
沃尔夫：好吧，想象今天是你的生日.
WOLF: Okay, so imagine it's your birthday.

2149
01:31:44,437 --> 01:31:45,806
今天是我的生日.
SNAKE: It is my birthday.

2150
01:31:45,939 --> 01:31:47,474
狼：是的，我知道.所以，但我们要继续走下去
WOLF: Yeah, I know. So, but we're walking along

2151
01:31:47,608 --> 01:31:48,976
你遇到了一个精灵.
and you meet a genie.

2152
01:31:49,109 --> 01:31:50,443
好的.他叫什么名字？
SNAKE: Okay. What's his name?

2153
01:31:50,578 --> 01:31:51,812
精灵叫什么名字？
What's the genie's name?

2154
01:31:51,945 --> 01:31:53,446
是的，我想知道我在跟谁说话.
Yeah, I want to know who I'm talking to.

2155
01:31:53,581 --> 01:31:54,982
我不知道，简而言之是精灵还是吉恩.
I don't know, Genie or Gene for short.

2156
01:31:55,115 --> 01:31:56,650
所以他给了你三个愿望.
So he offers you three wishes.

2157
01:31:56,784 --> 01:31:57,818
为什么是三个？
Why three?

2158
01:31:57,951 --> 01:31:59,086
你知道，行业标准.
You know, industry standard.

2159
01:31:59,219 --> 01:32:00,487
现在，你想要什么？
Now, what do you wish for?

2160
01:32:00,621 --> 01:32:02,255
-呃-祝你们好运，伙计们.
-Uh... -Good luck out there, guys.

2161
01:32:02,389 --> 01:32:03,757
我什么都不想去.
I'm gonna go with nothing.

2162
01:32:03,891 --> 01:32:05,058
（笑）：什么都没有？
(laughing): Nothing?

2163
01:32:05,192 --> 01:32:06,627
来吧，今天是你的生日.
Come on, it's your birthday.

2164
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:08,762
好吧，但我需要什么愿望呢？
All right, but what do I need wishes for?

2165

2169
01:32:14,802 --> 01:32:16,670

I got the skin of a reptile half my age.

2170
01:32:16,804 --> 01:32:19,106
我不知道你的年龄有一半，但你看起来不错.
I don't know about half your age, but you do look good.

2171
01:32:19,239 --> 01:32:20,574
那是因为你刚刚蜕皮.

01:32:35,288 --> 01:32:37,057
-偷车-食人鱼！

2176
01:32:37,190 --> 01:32:38,859
我在开玩笑.
I was joking.

2177
01:32:38,992 --> 01:32:40,327
这是个玩笑.
It was a joke.

2178
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:42,062
你知道，仔细想想，沃尔夫，
You know, on second thought, Wolf,

2179
01:32:42,195 --> 01:32:44,231
也许我想搭个便车.

2183
01:32:50,137 --> 01:32:52,973

-Hey, guys. Ready to get to work? -(mews)

2184
01:32:53,106 --> 01:32:54,274
（笑）：嘿.哇.
(chuckling): Hey. Whoa.

2185
01:32:54,407 --> 01:32:56,276
狼蛛：哦.
TARANTULA: Aw.

That's right. Come here.

2189
01:33:01,949 --> 01:33:03,083
再近一点.
Little closer.

2190
01:33:03,216 --> 01:33:04,785
我说靠近点.
I said closer.

2191
01:33:04,918 --> 01:33:08,121
现在我们有时间认识了，
Now that we've had some time to get acquainted, uh,

2192
01:33:08,255 --> 01:33:10,758
现在没那么可怕了吧？
not so scary now, are we?

2193
01:33:10,891 --> 01:33:12,259
韦伯斯，点击.
Webs, hit it.
