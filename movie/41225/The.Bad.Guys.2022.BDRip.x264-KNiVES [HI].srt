But we can all agree

316
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,862
that there is a flower of goodness
inside all of us

317
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,833
just waiting to blossom.

318
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,783
[Wolf] <i>Once inside,
there are two armored doors.</i>

319
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,864
<i>The first can only be opened
by a special key card</i>

320
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,672
<i>that is carried by our dear friend,
the chief of police.</i>

321
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,441
<i>The second is outfitted
with a retinal scanner</i>

322
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,344
<i>and guarded by an elite special-ops unit</i>

323
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,112
<i>trained to strike first
and ask questions later.</i>

324

[insect buzzing]

325
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,721
[Wolf] <i>Governor Foxington is the only one
who has clearance to open the second door.</i>

326
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:29,227
<i>So, step two, she and I will need to
get up close and personal.</i>

327
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:32,025
Enjoy your evening, Mr. Ambassador.

328
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,724
[Wolf] Interesting piece.

329
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:37,201
Trashy, pointless and pretentious.

330
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:41,901
Hmm. They say that art reveals
more about the viewer than the artist.

331
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,066
Mister...

332
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,442
- Poodleton. Oliver Poodleton.
- Okay.

333
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:51,278
It's about time someone stood up
to those diabolical Bad Guys.

334
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,216
Though, I've got to say,
no one's succeeded yet.

335
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,778
Eh. I don't think it'll be that hard.

336
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,153
I have a feeling
it'll be harder than you think.

337
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,592
I'd say they're one epic job away
from cementing their legacy.

338
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,392
Mr. Poodleton. You're funny.

339
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,661
I am?

340
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,099
The only legacy they're cementing
is life in prison.

341
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,229
Did you see their last job?

342
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:17,242
Ugh, unsecured exits, crude disguises,
compulsive showboating.

343
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,640
I mean, it was a mess.

344
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,475
All the classic signs
of a crew in decline.

345
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,481
Next, they're gonna make it personal.

346
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,847
That's when you know they're toast.

347
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,649
Uh, well, that's your opinion.

348
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,781
It is. And I'm the governor.

349
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:37,589
As for the sculpture,
I think it's about perspective.

350
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,131
If you look closely enough,

351
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,362
even trash can be recycled
into something beautiful.

352
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,931
[Wolf] How about that.

353
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,538
I guess some things
aren't always as they appear.

354
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,445
That reminds me, may I?

355
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,812
I can't miss a photo op with the governor
and a pile of garbage.

356
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,715
Mr. Poodleton,
you're too hard on yourself.

357
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:00,842
Hey...

00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,386
Okay, friends.

360

It's showtime.

[Wolf] <i>Once we're in,

<i>We split up and we take our positions.</i>

363
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,697
Officers, if the Bad Guys
crash this event,

364
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,532
I am definitely going to lose my job.

365
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:23,302
And I will not hesitate to
take you down with me.

366
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,467
Now, move out!

367
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,021
[officers] Yes, ma'am!

No, thank you.
My life is too complicated right now.

Keep your eyes open, boys.

00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,024
[Shark] <i>Copy that.
I'm on my way.</i>

473
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,807
[stomach gurgling]

474
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,313
Hurry up, guys.

475
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,440
Time to turn this baby on beast mode.

476
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,545
Eat it, WP.S.S.T.

477
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,426
- [gurgling continues]
- Please, not now.

478
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,239
- [Piranha] Wolf!
- Wait, wait, wait. No, Piranha!

479
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:26,753
- This award is for...
- [farts]

480
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,992
[clears throat] As I was saying...

481
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,071
No, no, no.

482
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,402
[sniffs]

483
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,275
Piranha! Are you kidding me?

484
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:41,244
[Piranha] Sorry!

485
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,509
And that's why
my Gala for Goodness

486
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,414
will raise all the money needed
for those less fortunate.

487
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,685
- [Chief] Come on!
- [knocking]

488
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:48,913
[gasps]

489
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,645
I'm starting to get mad here, Larry.

490
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,149
[Wolf] <i>Webs! Webs!</i>

491
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,987
And now,
the moment we've all been waiting for.

492
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:00,690
- [Wolf gasps]
- Whoa!

493
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,805
[Shark] Excuse me.
Is this the ladies' room?

494
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,514
Oh, uh, you need to take a right
at the end of the hall, ma'am.

495
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,712
[gasps] Whoa.

496
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,848
Yes! Whoop-bam!

497
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,326
Oh, come on!

498
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:33,991
And now, it is my honor to award
Professor Marmalade

499
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:37,899
with the Golden Dolphin!

500
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,696
[guests murmuring]

501
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,238
- No!
- No!

502
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:44,070
Yes! I mean, yes!

503
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,002
What?

504
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:49,976
[screams]

505
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,344
- Everyone, everyone, please don't panic.
- [guests murmuring]

506
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,511
Just stay calm.

507
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,749
I'm sure there's an explanation for this.

508
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,492
I repeat, please do not panic.

509
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,088
[Wolf] Nice work, everybody.

510
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:09,394
Now, let's make like a wolf
and get the pack outta here.

511
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,094
Ah, wordplay.

512
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,828
I don't get it.

513
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,531
[Marmalade]
Diane, Diane, if I may...

514
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:16,670
You have to understand,

515
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,234
I didn't bring hope back to the city
for an award.

516
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:23,906
I did these good things
because of how they made me feel.

517
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:27,007
That tingly feeling I get.
That shiver up my spine.

518
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,077
The wag in my tiny tail.

519
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:32,853
Because you see,

520
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:37,122
being good just feels so good.

521
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:40,425
And when you're good, you're loved.

522
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,600
- Huh?
- Wolf?

523
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,080
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

524
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,304
- [Tarantula] Go!
- [Shark] Go!

525
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,900
It's the Bad Guys!

526
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,136
Arrest them!

527
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:53,438
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut!

528
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,906
They stole the Golden Dolphin!

529
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,975
Come on, you can't prove that.

530
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,247
[metal clanking]

531
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:05,056
My baby!

532
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,922
On your knees, Bad Guys,
with your hands up!

533
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,155
Never! We're outta here.

534
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,927
So long, suckers!

535
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,732
Well, this just got a little weird.

536
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:24,808
[siren wailing]

537
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,906
[Tiffany Fluffit] <i>The Bad Guys go bust!</i>

538
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,074
<i>The nefarious five some
has finally been captured.</i>

539
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,777
<i>And I, Tiffany Fluffit,
am first on the scene.</i>

540
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,843
Wow. You know, I just realized

541
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:39,117
that I have devoted my entire adult life
to putting you in jail.

542
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,783
You are my purpose.

543
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,850
Without you, who am I?

544
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,019
I'm just kiddin'!

545
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,621
This is the best moment of my life!

546
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,827
It's the end of the Bad Guys.

547
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:51,333
No!

548
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,427
Get your hands off of me.

549
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,803
You're begging for
a bitin' right now.

550
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,035
Wolf!

551
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:03,152
[reporter] Professor Marmalade!
Madam Governor!

552
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:04,306
Professor Marmalade!

553
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,942
- Madam Governor! Madam Governor!
- One at a time. One at a time.

554
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,378
- Hey. Hey!
- Excuse me.

555
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,354
- [reporters gasp]
- Sorry to interrupt,

556
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,154
I just wanted to congratulate
the governor here.

557
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,957
I gotta say, you really got us pegged.

558
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:22,296
We're just a deep well
of anger and self-loathing.

559
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,062
- Denial.
- [Wolf] Sure. That too.

560
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,446
- Narcissism.
- [Wolf] Yeah. Yeah.

561
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,699
Emotional emptiness.

562
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,136
So, we're on the same page.

563
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,231
What is he doin'?

564
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,367
Sadly, we were never given a chance

565
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,846
to be anything more
than second-rate criminals.

566
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,974
If only there was someone

567
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,351
who could help the flower of goodness
inside us blossom.

568
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:46,322
Some icon of love and forgiveness, like...

569
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,083
I don't know, Mother Teresa.

570
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:54,155
Best thing is to just throw us in jail
for the rest of our hopeless lives.

571
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,064
Yeah, that's the plan.

572
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,229
Wait, wait! No, no!

573
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,065
- Get in there.
- Ow!

574
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,731
- [Marmalade] Wait!
- [people murmuring]

575
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,206
B- Beg pardon?

576
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,403
Mr. Wolf may be a savage beast.

577
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,001
Basically, walking garbage.

578
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,410
Sorry, I'm making a paint.

579
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,073
Do what you need to do, pal.

580
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:15,710
But how can we say they're hopeless
if they've never been given a chance?

581
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:16,845
What if...

582
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,855
What if we tried
a little experiment, Diane?

583
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,221
As you know,
my Gala for Goodness...

584
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:25,195
the #Charity Event of the Year
is coming up.

585
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,790
If I can prove to everyone at that gala
that the Bad Guys have changed,

586
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,699
will you set them free
and give them a clean start?

587
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,534
[people gasping]

588
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,198
What? Professor Marmalade!

589
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,297
No, no, no.

590
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,774
Don't you see what he's doing?
He's playing you!

591
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,038
But it was my idea.

592
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,237
It was his idea.

593
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,303
But only because you made him have it!

594
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,781
Madam Governor,
you can't just let them go.

595
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:48,615
Professor, I'm not about to
put the safety of the city on the line

596
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,154
for an experiment.

597
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,916
Excuse me, Madam Governor.

598
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,483
I seem to remember that
a wise person once said,

599
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:59,587
"Even trash can be recycled
into something beautiful."

600
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,660
[scoffs]

601
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,932
Okay. I'm game.

602
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,404
But only because it's you, Professor.

603
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,472
No!

604
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,998
We'll hold onto the dolphin
until the gala,

605
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:14,306
just to remove
any unnecessary temptation.

606
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,506
Of course. Good thinking.

607
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:18,605
That's why you're governor.

608
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,849
Now that everyone's happy...

609
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,442
Not happy.

610
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,151
...I, Rupert Marmalade the Fourth,
will tum the Bad Guys into

611
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,919
the Good Guys!

612
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,257
[all] Ooh!

613
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,933
I think these belong to you.

614
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Hey!

615
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,494
[Diane] Not everyone gets a second chance.

616
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,472
Make the most of it, Mr. Poodleton.

617
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,646
[sirens wailing]

618
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,983
[Snake] Wolf.

619
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,317
What are you doing?

620
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:58,822
- [Wolf] What?
- Yeah.

621
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,324
Oh, that!

622
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,726
I'm sorry, I thought it was obvious.

623
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:05,728
We're gonna go good.

624
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,030
Uh, you totally lost me.

625
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:11,158
I told him to stop drinkin'
out of the toilet.

626
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,170
Hey, did you get hit on the head?

627
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,330
What? No, I didn't get...

628
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,305
My cousin got hit on the head
with an anchor,

629
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,206
and after that,
he only swam in a circle.

630
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,209
No, guy, guys, guys.
You're not following me.

631
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:23,246
We're gonna pretend to go good.

632
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,077
Just a few days with Marmalade.

633
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:29,086
And then,
we roll into the gala as good guys

634
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:32,418
and roll out scot-free with...

635
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:35,353
[all] The Golden Dolphin!

636
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:36,552
You got it.

637
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,857
Since when do we not finish a job?

638
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,230
The Bad Guys become the Good Guys

639
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,667
so we can stay the bad guys.

640
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,728
- You know what I'm saying?
- [all laughing]

641
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,739
Bad guys acting good?

642
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,674
It's the ultimate bad-guy thing.
It's fantastic.

643
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,371
Wolf, you're a genius!

644
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,512
It's gonna be, like,
the most relaxing con ever.

645
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,914
Like a vacation.

646
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,385
Oh, oh-oh-oh! A con-cation.

647
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:05,423
[all laughing]
[siren wailing continues]

648
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,514
[Shark] My parents met on a con-cation!

649
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,758
[seagulls squawking]

650
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:17,096
[Marmalade humming]

651
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:21,805
[doorbell rings]

652
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,203
Oh, goody!

653
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,605
[Wolf] Wow!

654
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,268
[Tarantula] Big and fancy.

655
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:29,074
Rodents got taste. Okay!

656
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,547
Almost makes me wanna be cute.

657
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:35,052
[Marmalade]
They say experience is the best teacher.

658
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,053
And they are wrong.

659
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,121
I am.

660
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,657
Good morning,
students of goodness.

661
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:45,753
And welcome to the first day
of the rest of your best life.

662
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,161
A giant butt!

663
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:48,765
Huh?

664
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,460
Uh, it's... it's not a butt.

665
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:54,232
It's a lamp in the shape
of the Love Crater Meteorite,

666
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,305
my greatest...

667
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,432
I wonder whose butt it is.

668
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:57,770
- [Wolf gasps]
- Uh...

669
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:00,641
Once again,
it's not a butt, thank you.

670
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:01,769
It's a heart.

671
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,791
- Now, as I was saying...
- Then why does it have cheeks?

672
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,815
- Shut it!
- What?

673
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,260
I've never seen a heart
with cheeks.

674
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,651
- [chuckles] It's not a...
- Booty!

675
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,744
It's not a butt! Not a butt!

676
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,449
Does he know what a butt is?

677
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,955
[grunts] As I was saying,

678
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,825
on the outside,
the five of you are villains,

679
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,988
predators,
remorseless sociopaths.

680
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,964
Oh, stop,
you're makin' me blush.

681
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,001
But inside, there's a flower.

682
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,797
The flower of goodness.

683
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,167
And when it blooms

684
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:31,265
and you feel that tingle of positivity
radiating through your body,

685
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,209
you're going to want to feel it
all the time.

686
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,973
So, we're going for a tingle?

687
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,310
Not any tingle.

688
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:38,872
The tingle of goodness.

689
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:43,147
Which you'll feel
in my state-of-the-art Sharing Laboratory!

690
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:46,949
Okay, Mr. Snake,
I'm going to give you a Push Pop.

691
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,551
Great! Push Pop just for me!

692
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,219
No, to share.

693
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,329
Why?

694
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,456
Well, on a fundamental level,

695
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,695
it's about putting someone else's needs
ahead of your own.

696
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:58,802
[chuckling]

697
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,497
Oh, no. No way.

698
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:01,732
Snake...

699
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,170
[sighs] All right, all right.

700
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,371
This is gonna taste extra sweet,

701
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,913
'cause I know how bad you want it.

702
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,483
[groaning]

703
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,917
Pap me, please. Ah!

704
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:16,487
[groaning]

705
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:19,585
Nope!

706
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,352
- Sucker!
- That's it! I'll teach you to share!

707
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,361
[all gasp]

708
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,591
I like sharin'. It's yummy. Mmm.

709
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,597
[Snake] Totally worth it.

710
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,757
Well, that's terrifying.

711
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,998
Let's try something simpler.

712
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:36,935
A good person always pays attention
to the needs of others.

713
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,567
Now, here's a kindly, frail grandma.

714
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,178
[all laughing]

715
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,238
Mr. Piranha,
help Grandma across the street.

716
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,613
Pish! Sure, sure, sure.
I do this all the time.

717
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,080
Here you go, ma'am.

718
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,553
[laughing]

719
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,522
Oh, he is totally gonna blow it.

720
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,855
- What was that? What did you say?
- [Tarantula laughing]

721
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,938
- You think I can't do this?
- No, no, no, Piranha...

722
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:58,962
[horn honking]

723
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:01,259
[Wolf screaming, grunts]

724
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:04,030
Maybe simpler?

725
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,729
[cat meowing]

726
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:09,103
Hey, look!
It's a cat stuck in a tree.

727
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,971
It doesn't get much simpler than that.

728
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:15,103
Now, what in this scenario
would give you that good tingle?

729
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:18,945
Eating it? This is why I always carry
two pieces of bread with me.

730
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,816
No. Want you to s...

731
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,046
- Smack it.
- Skin it?

732
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:24,953
Stab it.

733
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,056
- Sauté it.
- Sing to it?

734
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,388
Save it. I want you to save...

735
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,826
It's so obvious... I want you to save it.

736
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:33,260
[all] Oh! Right, right.

737
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,761
[all] Here, kitty, kitty cat!

738
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:37,834
[cat meowing]

739
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:40,233
Whoa,
that cat is obviously defective.

740
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,296
What is wrong with you?
You're gonna give it a heart attack.

741
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,772
I'll handle this.

742
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,810
What's up, papa!

743
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,239
- [yowling]
- Get him off my face! He's on my face!

744
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,307
No, no, no! Listen.
What are you doing?

745
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,289
[Wolf groaning]

746
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:02,757
Okay. What, may I ask, are you good at?

747
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,762
- Stealing stuff?
- Oh, yeah, we're great at that.

748
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,854
- Robbery.
- Larceny.

749
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:07,988
- Wire fraud.
- Extortion.

750
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,260
- Tax evasion.
- Heists.

751
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,373
- [Tarantula] Mail fraud.
- Wait. "Heists," you say?

752
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,699
Well, that's...
Yeah, that's kind of our specialty.

753
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:16,364
I might just have an idea.

754
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,870
[protestors] Free the pigs! Free the pigs!

755
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,968
That is an animal testing lab.

756
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:25,175
Within, 200,000 helpless guinea pigs,

757
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:29,220
all being poked and prodded
by sadistic scientists.

758
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,685
Guinea pigs, you say?

759
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,119
Snake...

760
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,521
I want you to rescue them.

761
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:35,786
But this is a heist for good.

762
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,160
So, I brought something
more friendly for you to wear.

763
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,459
Bye.

764
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,295
Well, there goes our street cred.

765
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,163
At least it's comfy.

766
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,732
[Wolf] All right,
we need to distract that scientist.

767
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,968
- Shark, you're up.
- Copy that.

768
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,478
Okay. We're gonna need
a rope and a hook.

769
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,637
I got this one.

770
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,857
- What?
- You're volunteering?

771
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,849
You've never volunteered
for anything.

772
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,907
Sure I did. Right now.

773
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,578
- Throw me up there! Giddy up!
- Really?

774
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:06,248
Yep.
I'm 99% sure you can make it.

775
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,086
- Okay.
- Let's do it!

776
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,423
- Hey there, son.
- Dad?

777
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:13,224
I know you've got an important job,

778
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,732
but I hope you still have time
for a catch with your old man.

779
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,528
- [gasps]
- [Snake groans]

780
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,263
- Hey, kiddo.
- [Snake] 96% sure.

781
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,236
You'll always be my special boy.

782
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,899
[groans] Maybe 90%.

783
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:26,670
I've been waiting my entire life
for this moment.

784
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,822
- Okay, then. Now, go long.
- [Snake] Ow! I don't know.

785
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:31,508
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Thank you, Daddy!

786
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,777
[laughing]

787
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,882
Ow! Fifty? What day is it?

788
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,421
[Snake] Who am I?

789
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:41,253
Right. The guinea pigs are locked
behind a three-foot thick steel door.

790
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,123
The only way in
is through the vents.

Chief, may I do the honors?

That's not the plan.

1108
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,814
What is happening?

1109
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,372
He's gone rogue.

1110

A deal's a deal.

1111
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,318
By the power vested in me,

1112
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:50,417
it is a pleasure to
grant the Bad Guys a full par...

[guests gasping, murmuring]

1114
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:54,830
That was weird.

1115
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:56,491
The meteorite is gone!

1116
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:57,692

Wolf.

Here, here.

- What are you doing?
- I'm giving it all back.

1126
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:30,790
Huh?

1127
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:33,865
[Wolf] Excuse me.

1128
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:38,402
What happened back there?

1129
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:40,756
- I couldn't do it.
- What do you mean you couldn't do it?

1130
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,107
- [Wolf] I just.
- No t...

1131
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:44,044
I do not run.

That is not how I roll.

1133

Piranha, don't do anything crazy.

Ha-ha-ha-ha!

You should always judge a book

Stop, for goodness' sake!
Let me speak to them.

You've got five minutes.
No deals this time.

You have to help us. Tell them.
Tell them we didn't do it.

There, there. Of course you didn't do it.
How could you?

1153
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:42,161
After all, you're such a good boy.

You're such a good boy.

Arrest them!

The old lady, the Golden Dolphin,

It was all to get us here

any thoughts on how the Bad Guys

00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,658
managed to steal the meteorite
in plain sight?

1216
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:20,251
Well, off the top of my head,

1217
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,957
perhaps they accessed
the site previously

1218
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:24,693
and set up an intricate system
of tunnels and trapdoors

1219
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:27,947
that could be remotely triggered to suck
the meteorite down into a holding area.

1220
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:29,582
- But how should I know?
- [Tiffany Fluffit] Totally.

1221

[Marmalade] I mean,

[Wolf] <i>I'm giving it all back.</i>

I can't believe we got double-crossed
by a tiny rodent.

1224
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,887
Oh, we got double-crossed
by a rodent, all right.

1225
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:28,896
But, uh, not a tiny one.

1226
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:30,056
What?

1227
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:32,999
This was supposed to be
us conning Marmalade.

1228
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:36,004
It turns out, it was Wolf conning us.

- Why would you think that?

1231
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,872
I don't know,
maybe because you just sabotaged

1232
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:46,075
the biggest heist of our lives?

1233
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:48,446
I think you owe us
an explanation, buddy.

and not just steal it?

when the old lady fell...

[clears throat]
...and I kinda helped her.

What?

But then you stole her purse?

1246
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:14,406
No. I didn't.

1247
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:18,710
I saved the old lady, and she hugged me,
and my tail wagged,

1248
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,751
and I didn't know what it was,
but it felt, you know...

1249
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:23,385
good.

1250
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,943
[all gasp]

1251
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:27,921
Ah! But then,
you stole the purse?

01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:29,618
[all] No!

1253
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:33,390
You know, I heard what the pig said
to you about cuttin' us loose.

1254
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,727
Wait. Like, "us" us?

1255
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,994
But I never thought
you'd actually do it, man.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1257

01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:47,638
Our life was perfect
until you decided to ruin it.

1260
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:48,744
[Wolf] I didn't,

1261
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,007
You guys felt it at the gala.

1262
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:53,082
The clapping, the cheering.

1263
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,948
We were more than just scary villains.
They loved us.

1264
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:58,613
Oh, yeah? If they loved us so much,

1265
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:01,680
how come we're in prison
for a crime we didn't commit?

1266
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,325
You know what?

1267
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:06,919
I'll give Marmalade this:
At least he sees the world for what it is:

1268
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:10,990
A place where some people are scary
and some people are scared.

1269
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:14,502
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm tired of bein' scary.

1270
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:16,504
I'm tired of bein' an outcast.

1271
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:18,973
- Maybe I don't wanna be a...
- What? A bad guy?

1272
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:21,374
Don't wanna be
a bad guy anymore, huh?

1273
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:22,638
Say it, Wolf!

1274
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:26,806
Yeah, I thought so.

1275
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:29,352
And us? Your lifelong friends?

1276
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:30,572
We're just holdin' you back?

1277
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:32,314
Yeah, maybe you are!

1278
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:34,787
[gasps]

1279
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:37,453
- Take it back.
- Snake!

1280
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,188
Take it back! Apologize!

1281
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:41,161
Hey, hey, hey!

1282
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:42,994
Prison is no place for fighting.

1283
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,731
Tell that to him.

1284
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:46,835
[Wolf] Huh?

1285
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:53,869
- What?
- [shouting]

1286
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:02,240
[grunts, shouts]

1287
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:03,351

[high-pitched shout, screams]

1289
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:11,524
- [guard screaming]
- Shh.

1290
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:19,498
[shouts]

1291
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:25,704
[screams]

1292
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,540
[both grunt]

1293
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:38,384
Wait, wait! Hold...

1294
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:41,887
[all gasp] Diane?

1295
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:44,436
But how do you know how to do
all of that kick-kick-punch-punch?

1296
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,895
Wait a sec, you're the Crimson Paw?

1297
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:52,194
[Wolf] <i>The Queen of Cons,
Acrobatic Swiss Army Knife,</i>

1298
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:54,760
<i>stole the Zumpango diamond twice,
once for profit,</i>

1299
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:56,396
<i>second time just for fun.</i>

1300
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:59,100
<i>Never identified, never caught.</i>

1301
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:03,236
[chuckles] Guess I'm still the best
bad guy the world has ever seen.

1302
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,445
- [sighs] At least I used to be.
- [alarm blaring]

1303
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:08,415
- [guards screaming]
- [Wolf, Shark gasp]

1304

[screams]

1305
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:18,826
Nope, I am still the best.

1306
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:21,295
Just like riding a stolen bicycle.

1307
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:23,992
Oh. Uh, you got a little... Ouch.

1308
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,330
Hey, why...
Why did you save us anyway?

1309
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:28,733
After the gala,
I knew something wasn't right.

1310
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,739
So, I did some investigating,
and that meteor...

1311
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:31,807
I know.

1312
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:34,570
Some kinda
cosmic-mega-super-antennae thing.

1313
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,170
Right. If conducted through
an array of ionized crystals,

1314
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,648
it will generate a massive
psychokinetic field the size of a city.

1315
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:43,310
Oh, my gosh, did I interrupt you?
Were you gonna say that?

1316
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:47,287
Uh... I was gonna be a little more
technical, but you got the gist of it.

1317
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:48,414
[Diane laughs]

1318
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:53,260
Marmalade needs to be stopped,
but I can't do it alone.

1319
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,822
- You know his compound better than anyone.
- You can count on us.

1320
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:58,196
Right, guys?

1321
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:00,525
There is no "us."

1322
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:02,161
We're through, Wolf.

1323
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:04,103
Done. Finito.

1324
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,868
Because of that little tiff back there?

1325
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:08,706
Come on, man, that's what we do.

1326
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:10,870
You serve, I volley.
That's our little dance.

1327
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,512
Not this time.

1328
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:20,055
Piranha?

1329
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:25,017
Webs?

1330
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:26,390
Sorry, Wolfie.

1331
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,692
Shark...

1332
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:31,233
Hmm.

1333
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:32,495
Hey.

1334
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:34,402
Guys?

1335
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:36,868
Guys?

1336
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,168
You wanna know why I hate birthdays, Wolf?

1337
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:41,243
Do you?

1338
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:46,713
When you grow up a snake,
nobody shows up to your party.

1339
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:49,842
Birthdays are a constant reminder
that out there

1340
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:54,481
I'm just a scary,
good-for-nothin' monster.

1341
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:57,150
Yeah.

1342
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:00,859
But nothing compares
to havin' the one guy...

1343
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:04,230
The one guy I thought I could trust...

1344
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,064
Stab me in the back.

1345
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:12,265
Come on, guys. Let's get outta here.

1346
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:42,932
[helicopter approaching]

[electricity crackling]

1348
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:03,656
Now, this is what a true bad guy
looks like.

1349

[helmet whirs]

1350
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,264
What do you say we have some fun?

Hey.

1357
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:54,209
You okay?

1358
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:56,106
No, I'm not okay.

1359
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:58,442
I'm very, very un-okay.

1360
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:02,842
Um, I just left the only friends
I have ever had, so what am...

1361
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:05,115
What am I doin"?

1362
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:07,615
[sighs]

1363
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:09,886
I know this isn't easy,

1364
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:12,358
leaving everything behind.

1365
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:15,024
- Do you?
- Yeah.

1366
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:17,293
I was the best thief in the world.

1367
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:20,392
Fast, fearless, inventive.

1368
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:23,734
I just had one thing left to steal.

1369
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,830
The Golden Dolphin.

1370
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:26,966
So you went after it.

1371
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,478
I didn't just go after it.

1372
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:32,546
<i>Had it.</i>

1373
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:34,582
<i>And a clear escape route.</i>

1374
01:07:37,853 --> 01:07:38,853
<i>But...</i>

1375
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:44,319
<i>all I saw in the end was the tricky fox
that they always told me I was.</i>

1376
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:48,029
<i>It changed everything.</i>

1377
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:52,897
<i>So, now, instead of hurting people,
I'm helping them.</i>

1378
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:54,697
I'm still me. [Chuckles]

1379
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:57,865
I'm just me, on the right side.

1380
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,699
You're doing the right thing.

1381
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:04,439
And some day, your friends,
if they're real friends,

1382
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:06,671
I think they'll understand.

1383
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:09,950
Now, come on, let's get inside.

1384

you just busted out of a prison.

Okay, oddly timed, but you do you.

- [automated voice] <i>Identity verified.</i>
- What?

<i>Welcome, Diane.</i>

1397
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:40,576
Whoa!

1398
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:43,118
Holy moly!

Ah! It's so good to be home.

Laser-sighted zip line?

The XM 2400 Radar Jammer? No way!

1403
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,284
I actually prefer the earlier model.

1404

Agree to disagree.

1405
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:58,067
This stuff is nice too. [Screams]

1406
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:59,727
Yeah, that's a blowtorch.

1407
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,566
Also, not really your color.

1408
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:02,661
Ugh.

1409
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:03,932
[Diane] All righty.

1410
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:08,637
Marmalade, what are you up to,
you fuzzy little weirdo?

1411
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:10,143
We need eyes on the city.

1412
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:13,614
Let's see if we can't hack into
the government's surveillance satellite.

1413
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:15,427
But you're the governor.
Couldn't you just ask?

1414
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:16,976
Yeah, but the paperwork.

suspicious activity here.

01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:28,323
Those are guinea pig heat signatures.

1419
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:30,592
Marmalade seems to be
controlling them.

1420
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:32,757
But to do what?

1421
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:34,030
There are no obvious targets.

1422
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,701
That's because they're moving targets.

1423
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:41,333
[gasps] His charity fundraiser.

1424
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:44,344
He's gonna steal the money.
Raised in his own name?

1425
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:46,881
It's the greatest heist
the world's ever seen.

1426
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:49,212
One billion dollars inside trucks

1427
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:51,309
on their way to charities
all over the city.

1428
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:52,931
We need to cut off
Marmalade's communication

1429
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:53,955
with his guinea pig army.

1430
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,513
If there's no signal...

1431
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:56,853
There's no heist.

1432
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:59,451
[both] We have to steal the meteorite.

1433
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:00,552
That was very cute...

1434
01:10:00,663 --> 01:10:02,007
- All right.
- ...what we just did there.

1435
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:04,363
Put on your big-girl pants.
We're gearin' up.

1436
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,308
I wouldn't take that.
Those things rip your pants right off.

1437
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:16,709
Huh. Try wearing clean underwear.
Just in case.

1438
01:10:17,913 --> 01:10:19,005
What...

1439
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:22,682
You stole my car?

1440
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:24,412
Respect.

1441
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,715
Let's do this.

1442
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:38,230
[elevator bell dings]
[all gasp]

1443
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:39,411
- [Shark] No!
- [Snake] What?

1444
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:40,664
[Piranha] All our stuff?

1445
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:42,981
- [Tarantula] Oh, no.
- Where is everything?

1446
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:45,201
- No, no, no!
- All our stuff.

1447
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:47,402
- It's all gone!
- My disguise closet!

1448
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:48,943
[Tarantula] Where's my things?

1449
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:52,747
Wolf gave away all our loot!

1450
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:55,283
We stole it fair and square!

1451
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:58,786
Now I understand what it feels like
to have things stolen from you.

1452
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:01,346
[panting] I don't like it.

1453
01:11:02,057 --> 01:11:05,288
I really don't like it! [Whimpering]

1454
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:11,765
- [grumbles]
- [Shark crying] We got no food.

1455
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:14,112
We got no money.
We got no money we could use to buy food.

1456
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:15,626
No food we can sell for money.

1457
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,570
We... [cries]

1458
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:20,798
All right! Okay, okay.

1459
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:22,536
Here, here. Take it.

1460
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:24,807
Now, stop cryin', buddy.

1461
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:27,041
Oh!

1462
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:32,711
Um... Snake, what did you just do?

1463
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:34,449
What? My friend was sad.

1464
01:11:34,556 --> 01:11:36,081
I was just cheerin' him up.

1465
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:37,387
You...

1466
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:39,393
You did a good thing. For me.

1467
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:40,553
Don't be ridiculous.

1468
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:42,961
I just put your needs before my own.

1469
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:45,591
- Yeah. You're being good.
- I'm not.

1470
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:48,638
I was simply making a sacrifice
so Shark could be happy.

1471
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:51,570
That is the actual definition
of being good.

1472
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,801
Snake!

1473
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:54,672
You! The worst one of us!

1474
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:56,905
- The most selfish.
- Spiteful.

1475
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:58,105
- Terrible.
- Sneaky.

1476
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,477
- Dishonest.
- Insensitive.

1477
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:00,625
- Manipulative.
- Snake-like.

1478
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:02,811
- Stanky.
- And your point is?

1479
01:12:03,419 --> 01:12:05,285
I think Wolf was right.

1480
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:08,153
Maybe we could be
more than just scary villains.

1481
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:10,591
[gasps]

1482
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:12,960
What...

1483
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:14,189
[Tarantula] Oh, wow!

1484
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:16,321
Is this... Is this "wagging"?

1485
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,961
[Tarantula] We're wagging!

1486
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:24,364
No! No! No!

1487
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:28,376
We'll always be bad guys!

1488
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:36,148
[panting]

1489

[cackling]

01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:57,037
Faster, faster, my little pigs.

01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:58,834
[children cheering]

[screams]

1496
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:10,151
No!

[tires screeching]

1503
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:44,444
Once we steal the meteorite,
we take it straight to the police.

1504
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:46,385
And all will be forgiven.

1505
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:49,914
I don't know about "all,"
but it's a start.

1506
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:10,475
That's strange.

1507
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:13,879
Why would Marmalade
leave the Golden Dolphin unprotected?

1508
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:15,917
Because maybe it's a trap.

1509
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:17,543
- Or maybe...
- Wait, wait, wait!

1510
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:18,780
[Wolf screaming]

1511
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:21,051
Yeah, it was a trap.

1512
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,557
[Marmalade] Well, well, well.

1513
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:25,286
If it isn't my prized pupil.

1514
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:27,294
And you've brought along the governor.

1515
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:29,990
Or should I say, the Crimson Paw?

1516
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:31,623
[gasps, grunts]

1517
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:35,294
What an ingenious way
to disguise the Zumpango diamond.

1518
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:38,339
Hiding it in plain sight.

1519
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,908
You gotta be kidding me.

1520
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,670
What? I'm sentimental.

1521
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:43,176
You always did have panache.

1522
01:14:43,278 --> 01:14:46,509
And yet,
you still fell right into my trap.

1523
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:48,743
But how did you know
we'd even be here?

1524
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:51,946
Oh, I got a little tip... from a friend.

1525
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:53,317
[Snake hissing]

1526
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:56,414
Hey, buddy. How's it hangin'?

1527
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:58,459
Snake.

1528
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:01,519
[laughs]
What can I say? We just clicked.

1529
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:04,998
Oh, yeah? How's it feel to be workin'
for your favorite food?

1530
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:09,537
Ah, you're just jealous to be missin' out
on the heist of the century.

1531
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:10,696
It's got everything.

1532
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:14,436
Betrayal, a meteor, mind control.

1533
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,602
Can I try it on?

1534
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:18,271
- Of course, partner.
- Nice.

1535
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:21,612
All the crime
with none of the exercise.

1536
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:25,111
And what about all that
"Flower of goodness" talk?

1537
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:26,313
Was it all just a lie?

1538
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:28,049
Uh, pretty much, yeah.

1539
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:30,056
You see,
I never cared about what's "good."

1540
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:32,126
Only what's good for me.

1541
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:34,686
Like, say, a billion dollars.

1542
01:15:34,796 --> 01:15:37,493
Ooh! I just got a tingle.
[laughing]

1543

[Marmalade, Snake laughing]

1544

Go bad...

1545
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:41,698
Or go home.

1546
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:44,670
Cuddles! Finish them.

1547
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:50,576

Don't breathe it in.

1550
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,344
Wait a second. [Sniffs]

1551
01:15:59,421 --> 01:16:00,820
That's not poison gas.

1552

- [Piranha] Sorry!
- [Wolf gasps]

Surprise! [Laughing]

1555
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:07,991
[Wolf] What?

1556
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:11,590
- Guys! I can't believe it's you.
- You were right, Wolfie.

1557
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,998
- We felt the wag, man.
- [Piranha] And the tingle.

1558
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:15,764
- It's good, right?
- [Shark] Oh, yeah!

1559
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:17,999
This is super moving,
but can we do this later?

1560
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:20,508
Feels like I got
a rhythm section in my fin!

[beat boxing]

1562

Oh, yeah. Right.

1565
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:27,409
Sorry. I got it.

1566

Guys,

1567
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:32,718
am I happy to see you!

1568
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:35,086
- [Wolf sighs]
- [Piranha chuckles]

1569
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:40,518
Now it's time to huff and puff
and blow this little piggy's heist down.

1570
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,407
- [Tarantula] Game over, guinea pig!
- [all cheering]

1571
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:45,696
With this meteorite,
we will be able to commit crimes

1572
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:47,599
people have only dreamed about.

1573
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:49,762
Not bad for a butt rock.

1574
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:51,930
Once again, it's not a...

1575

- [gasps]
- Don't mind us, just robbin' this place.

1735
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:53,384
I know.

1736
01:24:53,455 --> 01:24:54,923
So pathetic, right?

1737
01:24:55,023 --> 01:24:56,582
Come on, guys.

1738
01:24:57,192 --> 01:24:58,887
Who said it was the end?

1739
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,121
- [all gasp]
- [Snake laughs]

1740
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:05,028
- [Piranha] Whoo-hoo!
- [Snake laughing]

1741
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:06,767
Gah!

1742
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:16,302
[Marmalade] No! Cuddles!
We're losing altitude!

1743
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:18,607
We're losing altitude! We're going down!

1744
01:25:23,218 --> 01:25:25,084
[gasps, coughs]

1745
01:25:25,153 --> 01:25:26,985
What happened?
Did we blow up?

1746
01:25:27,088 --> 01:25:28,088
Is this heaven?

1747
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:32,987
[Wolf grunting]

01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:35,930
[officers chattering]

1749
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,898
- [laughs] That is it.
- [Piranha] Hey!

1750
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:44,405
There is absolutely no way
you're getting away this time.

1751
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:45,598
Wait, Chief.

1752
01:25:45,673 --> 01:25:46,936
Governor Foxington?

1753
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:48,128
- Don't do this.
- [Wolf] Ow!

1754
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:50,645
They didn't steal the meteorite.
They were bringing it back.

1755
01:25:50,745 --> 01:25:53,077
Hal How could you know that?

1756
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:54,616
Unless...

1757
01:25:54,682 --> 01:25:58,118
Unless you were conspiring
with a bunch of known criminals.

1758
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:00,854
Well... [clears throat]

1759
01:26:01,589 --> 01:26:02,920
...as a matter of fact,

1760
01:26:04,092 --> 01:26:06,026
it's time I came clean about something.

1761
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:09,821
The truth is I'm really... [clears throat]

1762
01:26:09,931 --> 01:26:13,162
- ...really...
- Really a big fan of redemption arcs.

1763
01:26:13,268 --> 01:26:14,326
Yeah, we know.

1764
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:22,443
- We're done runnin' away.
- Yeah.

1765
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:23,636
- Yeah.
- Yep.

1766
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:26,447
Chief, do what you need to do.

1767
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:27,777
What?

1768
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:30,614
Y... You're turning yourself in?

1769
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:35,122
We might not have stolen the meteorite,
but we did steal a lot of other things.

1770
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,522
It's time we took some responsibility.

1771
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:39,491
Start a clean state.

1772
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:42,162
Take us in, Chief.

1773
01:26:43,331 --> 01:26:44,492
Wow, really?

1774
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:46,166
You finally did it.

1775
01:26:46,234 --> 01:26:48,794
This is your moment, Chief. Drink it in.

1776
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,965
[gasps] Wow!
You know, I should give a speech.

1777
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,633
Well, I should, shouldn't 1?

1778
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:54,885
- Uh...
- [Chief clears throat]

1779
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:56,138
When I was six years old,

1780
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:58,077
I decided that
I wanted to play the piccolo,

1781
01:26:58,179 --> 01:27:00,876
only to find that my fingers
were just too powerful

1782
01:27:00,982 --> 01:27:02,848
for that fragile little instrument.

1783
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:05,852
And that's when I discovered
law enforcement.

1784
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,081
[chuckles]

1785
01:27:07,188 --> 01:27:08,917
I'm proud of you, Wolf.

1786
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:12,186
You know,
a fox and a wolf are not that different.

1787
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,489
You got a good thing
goin" here, Governor.

1788
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:17,588
So, it turns out the saga of the Bad Guys
has come to

1789
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:20,396
<i>a simple and totally satisfying
conclusion.</i>

1790
01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:23,095
<i>Though, I wonder,
what happened to the meteorite?</i>

1791
01:27:23,204 --> 01:27:24,933
[Marmalade] <i>Cuddles! Faster, faster!</i>

1792
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:26,717
[Tiffany Fluffit]
<i>It's Professor Marmalade!</i>

1793
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:28,607
<i>He's bringing the meteorite back!</i>

1794
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:29,710
<i>Huh?</i>

1795
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:31,868
<i>Uh, yes. Yes.</i>

1796
01:27:31,946 --> 01:27:33,345
<i>Bringing it back.</i>

1797
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:35,007
That's precisely what I am doing.

1798
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:40,847
Look no further.

1799
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:43,084
Your hero has arrived.

1800
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:44,522
Professor, care to comment?

1801
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:46,583
I tried to help them, Tiffany.

1802
01:27:46,694 --> 01:27:49,220
But in the end,
it's the same old story.

1803
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:52,096
Bad guys, bad.
Good guys, good.

1804
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,793
So true. So wise.

1805
01:27:53,901 --> 01:27:55,562
Furthermore, for the good of the city,

1806
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:58,402
I have generously decided
to take the meteorite back

1807
01:27:58,473 --> 01:28:00,771
to my compound for safekeeping.

1808
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:03,936
- [crowd cheering]
- Is he seriously gonna get away with this?

1809
01:28:04,045 --> 01:28:06,912
Thank you.
Gosh, you're kind.

1810
01:28:06,981 --> 01:28:08,540
Give it up for me!

1811
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:10,106
[Chief] Wait a second.

1812
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:11,947
This isn't the meteorite!

1813
01:28:12,053 --> 01:28:13,418
- It's a lamp!
- [Marmalade gasps]

1814
01:28:13,488 --> 01:28:15,422
- [all] Huh?
- [laughing]

1815
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:16,490
[all] What?

1816
01:28:16,991 --> 01:28:18,982
[Tarantula] <i>Snake, what did you just do?</i>

1817
01:28:19,093 --> 01:28:21,755
[Snake] <i>What? My friend was sad,
and I was just cheerin' him up.</i>

1818
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:23,627
[Tarantula] <i>/ think Wolf was right.</i>

1819
01:28:23,731 --> 01:28:26,428
<i>Maybe we could be
more than just scary villains.</i>

1820
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:31,500
I'm bad, you're bad.

1821
01:28:31,606 --> 01:28:32,903
Let's be bad together.

1822
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:34,840
You've got yourself a deal.

1823
01:28:36,778 --> 01:28:39,577
- Can I try it on?
- Of course, partner.

1824

- [Snake gasps]
- Don't mind us, just robbin' this place.

No, no, no!

1826
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:10,273
- But if that's a lamp, where is the...

1827
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:11,710
The old switcheroo.

This is the Zumpango diamond!

But this was stolen by the...
[gasps]

1838
01:29:57,191 --> 01:29:59,523
By the Crimson Paw!

1839
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:01,034
- Me? No, no, no.
- [crowd murmuring]

1840

OMG.

1841
01:30:03,164 --> 01:30:05,075
- And a shocking twist.
- You're making a huge mistake.

1842
01:30:05,099 --> 01:30:08,535
The notorious bandit
known as the Crimson Paw

1843
01:30:08,603 --> 01:30:12,233
has been revealed to be
none other than Professor Marmalade.

1844
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:13,780
[Marmalade] I'm not the Crimson Paw.

1845
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:15,240
She's the Crimson Paw.

1846
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:16,572
She's the Paw!

1847
01:30:16,677 --> 01:30:18,736
I'm a flower of goodness! No!

Whoo! That's my reptile, right there.

1849
01:30:21,349 --> 01:30:22,909
- That's what I'm talkin' about.
- Yeah!

1850
01:30:23,017 --> 01:30:25,679
Come on, somebody had to
destroy that meteorite.

1851
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:27,118
That thing was dangerous.

1852
01:30:27,221 --> 01:30:29,383
That was pretty good there, Snakey.

1853
01:30:29,457 --> 01:30:31,391
Good? It was genius.

1854
01:30:31,459 --> 01:30:33,291
Not only did I foil the pig,

1855
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:36,386
I got you to admit
how much you care about me.

1856

Sure, yeah.

1857
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:39,260
I just wonder about one little thing.

Oh, yeah? What's that, Wolf?

1859
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:44,565
Who do you think
put that one Push Pop in the fridge?

01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:47,533
Wait.

1861

So, imagine it's your birthday.

01:31:43,698 --> 01:31:45,698
- [Snake] It is my birthday.
- [Wolf] Yeah, I know.

1882
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,859
But we're walkin' along,
and you meet a genie.

01:31:47,969 --> 01:31:50,631
- [Snake] Okay. What's his name?
- What's the genie's name?

1884
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:52,185
Yeah, I wanna know
who I'm talkin' to.

1885
01:31:52,273 --> 01:31:53,917
I don't know.
"Genie," or "Gene" for short.

01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:55,340
So he offers you three wishes.

1887
01:31:55,443 --> 01:31:56,467
Why three?

1888
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:59,605
You know, industry standard.
Now, what do you wish for?

1889
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,080
- Uh...
- Good luck out there, guys.

1890
01:32:01,115 --> 01:32:02,310
I'm gonna go with nothin...

1891
