1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,792
One Day, in a town at the edge of the world.

2
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,708
The tide went out and never returned.

3
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,250
The sea just left without warning.

4
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,750
At first people were little more than puzzled.

5
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:51,417
They continued to gossip and fight over the same old things.

6
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:58,000
But soon a silence began to permeate the township.

7
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:09,042
A desert of unbelievable magnitude was beginning to form before their very eyes.

8
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,500
We come together as family and friends

9
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:19,792
to farewell him and to grieve him.

10
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,833
we think especially of you, his family

11
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:25,917
Andrew, Penny, Jonathan.

12
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:30,750
For the loss of a father, a father-in-law and grandfather.

13
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:36,875
Part of our grief may be regret for things done

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,917
or left undone.

15
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,208
words said...

16
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,167
...or words never said.

17
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,042
Yes?

18
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:58,208
Is Andrew there?

19
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:01,000
You must be Paul.

20
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,750
Please, come in.

21
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:10,250
I'm Penny.

22
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,500
- Hi,Penny. - Andrew's wife.

23
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,750
Ah, they're in here.

24
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:23,583
Andrew?

25
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,042
Sorry...

26
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,833
My plane was delayed in Hong Kong.

27
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,500
Paul?

28
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,167
Thanks.

29
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:45,500
- Andrew? - Thanks.

30
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:53,500
Jonathan.

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,917
So, how's London? Is that where you're based?

32
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:06,958
Actually I'm spending more time in Istanbul these days.

33
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,500
Oh Jesus, fuck it, my balance is completely...fuck.

34
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,167
It's fine, really.

35
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:25,875
You have a nice place. You've done well.

36
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:30,875
I'll get Penny to make up a bed in a spare room.

37
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,458
- No that's fine. I made reservations from London. - No,really,it's no trouble.

38
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:35,708
No it's done. Andrew it's done.Thank you.

39
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,417
So...

40
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,125
He's gone.

41
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,083
Yeah.

42
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,500
Paul, wait!

43
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,500
Paul, wait!

44
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,458
Paul, come back!

45
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,750
Paul, don't leave!

46
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,708
Paul!

47
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,333
Andrew!

48
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,375
Shit!The lawyers.

49
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,292
Oh fuck!Sorry.

50
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,417
Sorry, I wanted to be there.

51
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,625
Slept in.How did it go?

52
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:40,458
He left you a third.

53
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,125
Well...you deserve two thirds.

54
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,333
He left me a third as well.

55
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,667
And the rest?

56
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:00,500
He left it to a charity.

57
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,250
Listen, I need to move on this,

58
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,667
We need to clear the orchard and the cottage. I can't wait around, Paul.

59
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,000
I made an appointment for you to see the lawyer on Tuesday.

60
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:16,833
Well, I'll drop by and see him later.

61
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,500
You can't just drop by and see

62
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:24,625
you can't just drop by and see them, Paul.

63
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,667
Right.

64
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,875
Hey you know what?

65
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:31,042
Another job came through.So

66
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,583
I'm leaving, tomorrow.

67
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,250
Well you obviously have more important things.

68
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,292
I'll see you in another 17 years.

69
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:45,333
Come on Andrew, don't be such an old

70
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:47,125
Come on Andew, don't what?

71
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,333
How long have you been here, Paul? Two days?

72
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,958
Forget the fact that this all just leaves me and

73
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,042
you're just like when mum died.

74
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:54,750
Oh leave mum the fuck out of it, Andrew.

75
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:56,833
At least have the decency to do that.

76
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:57,875
Decency?

77
00:07:58,042 --> 00:08:00,208
You think you're the one being decent?

78
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:04,167
Swanning in here like some bloody film star with your accent?

79
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:07,250
You know nothing about me, Andrew.

80
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,917
Listen, he would have wanted you to have these.

81
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,500
I almost forgot.

82
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,750
They handed me this at the council meeting.

83
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,833
You dropped it at the pub the afternoon of the service.

84
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:29,458
It could be useful getting home.

85
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,000
You didn't have to lie to me, Paul.

86
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,458
We weren't expecting you in the first place.

87
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:22,083
That's good wine you're spilling.

88
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,708
How did you find this place?

89
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:27,750
I heard music.

90
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,500
Mom doesn't know about this place?

91
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,583
No, she doesn't.

92
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,542
It's OK.

93
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:46,500
You can stay.

94
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,250
One day in a town at the edge of the world.

95
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,375
The tide went out and never returned.

96
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:35,500
When do you think you'll learn?

97
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,542
As soon as we get these blood samples back and the swabs, a couple of days.

98
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,833
I've extended my trip. I'll sort the house out.

99
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:54,583
Paul

100
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,750
Thanks.

101
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,000
Green tea.

102
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,042
What's he doing down there?

103
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,583
There's been an outbreak of some virus. I'm praying they're okay.

104
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,250
He cares about you, Paul.

105
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,333
He never told Jonathan about me.

106
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:34,750
We each have our own way of dealing with things.

107
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,625
I can't believe how much you look like mum.

108
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,458
Who is she?

109
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,667
That's hope.

110
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:33,167
Is she crying?

111
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,875
She's thinking.

112
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,958
About what?

113
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,333
Many things.

114
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:11,833
Turin Brakes "Full Of Stars"

115
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,500
Jesus!

116
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,750
What are you doing here?

117
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:36,250
It's just a place that I found that no one else comes to, I just...

118
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:39,958
Did he let you come here?

119
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:41,000
No.

120
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,333
No one knows that I come here.

121
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,083
I should probably go.

122
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:49,125
Yeah, I think you should.

123
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,583
I'll give you a couple of minutes to get your shit together and get out.

124
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:33,042
Paulie!

125
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,583
- Paulie Prior? - Hey, Winnie.

126
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,917
Look who it is

127
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:42,583
How are you doing?

128
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,333
I was looking for you at the service and I thought

129
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,917
I bet the little bugger is here somewhere. And I dont' even recognize him.

130
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:52,292
Ah no I had some complications.

131
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,458
Oh that's a shame. Hey you remember Pat.

132
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:59,292
Pat, look, look who it is. It's Paulie

133
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,750
Miss Seager!

134
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:03,750
Well, well...

135
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,500
Hey, Paul.

136
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:08,583
I had no idea you were still here.

137
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,208
What? you thought I'd dropped off the face of the earth?

138
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,167
And he even has the fancy bloomin plummy accent.

139
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:27,292
War zones.

140
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,750
From the genocide in Ruwanda

141
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,667
to the ceaseless fighting in the Middle East

142
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:35,375
and the horrors of the Bosnian conflict.

143
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:39,042
War zones have been both home and work

144
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:41,042
for the last decade to the man you are about to meet.

145
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,958
A man whose dedication and courage

146
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:46,333
has gained him an international reputation of the highest merit.

147
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,250
Not to mention

148
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,667
the numerous awards he has received for both his articles and photographs,

149
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,417
and that he is an old dear student of mine

150
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:58,083
who I taught in these very buildings.

151
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,083
I present to you Paul Prior.

152
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:13,875
Thank you.

153
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:17,000
That was a very generous introduction, Miss Seagar.

154
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:20,750
Yeah, my school reports were never that good.

155
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,333
The truth is that

156
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:28,875
I've been called many things,

157
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
many worse things since I last stepped foot in this building

158
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,583
vulture, parasite ,leech

159
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:45,250
And it's amazing how insults in most languages sound pretty much the same.

160
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,875
I was once

161
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:54,292
held captive for three days and publicly urinated on.

162
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:58,542
I don't really know what to say,

163
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,125
but I'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have.

164
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,875
He was a finalist for the Pulitzer

165
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,458
Pulitzer? What the hell is that?

166
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,708
It's a huge prize.

167
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,917
He had a one in three chance of winning it as well.

168
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,333
How do you know this shit?

169
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,583
I read an interview.

170
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:09,917
Sounds like a lone wolf.

171
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,792
That reminds me, I'm thinking of getting a tattoo.

172
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:17,042
A little unicorn, right here.

173
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:19,667
Why?

174
00:23:19,792 --> 00:23:21,542
Steve has exactly the same one?

175
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,625
No I just think it would be cool.

176
00:23:28,042 --> 00:23:30,250
So anyway.

177
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:34,250
How'd it go with Jake?

178
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:36,042
Piss off.

179
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:37,083
Tell me!

180
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:41,833
Well...

181
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,875
first of all we had a moonlight stroll down the beach

182
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,417
and a candle light dinner

183
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,333
and then he told me what beautiful eyes I had.

184
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:51,125
Really?

185
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:52,875
No, you dyke.

186
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:56,500
He only got drinks to go on the Big Day Out.

187
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:59,125
You know he was like

188
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:02,375
Yo man. Yo bitch.

189
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:07,417
And I think it should be quite so obvious.

190
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,125
I was reading the local rag today.

191
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,000
Front page.

192
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,083
Oh God.

193
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:26,333
I'd forgotten how quiet is, really.

194
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:30,833
I've had this bloody ringing in my ears ever since I got here.

195
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,458
Maybe the change here will do you good.

196
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,167
Like I said, if you ever get bored photographing war.

197
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,458
You weren't being serious, were you?

198
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,917
I'm three staff down, Paul.

199
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:51,833
I know it might sound desperate, but

200
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:55,167
Pat, I'd be hopeless, I've never taught in my life. Come on.

201
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:58,625
You went out and made something of yourself. What can beat that?

202
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:03,583
Half these kids don't even know what's on the other side of those hills.

203
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,208
Paul!

204
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,458
Paul gave Jonathan this.

205
00:25:48,292 --> 00:25:50,375
It's got a good zoom lens.

206
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:55,583
It's much, much too kind.

207
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,625
No, it's fine.

208
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,542
Honestly, I'm using digital these days.

209
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:01,500
If you're going to be a serious photographer, you need a good zoom lens.

210
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:09,750
See you tomorrow then.

211
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,667
Goodnight. Paul.

212
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,000
Goodnight.

213
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,625
Jonathan said he gave a talk at the school.

214
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,375
Apparently the kids really liked him.

215
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:39,292
Good.

216
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:54,708
Can I fuck you now?

217
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:56,583
God! You've got a way with words!

218
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:01,708
Sorry, what do you want to do then?

219
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,292
What you all doing man?

220
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:09,750
Just playing.

221
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,667
Just play carefully.

222
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:22,542
Shit! Fuck you!

223
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:27,167
You were meant to stay still.

224
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:00,958
You look well.

225
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:04,000
Well, used more like it.

226
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,417
It's different.

227
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:08,292
You have an accent. So English.

228
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:09,333
You think?

229
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,250
Well, it was inevitable.

230
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,292
Sick of being called an Australian.

231
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:15,333
Fair enough.

232
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:17,792
Help yourself.

233
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,833
Oh no, I quit.

234
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:23,042
Kids?

235
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:25,125
Two.

236
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:26,833
One of each.

237
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:28,875
Remember Ben?

238
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,333
Ben Steimer.

239
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:32,958
Yeah.

240
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36,708
We got together about 18 months after you left.

241
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:39,708
He died when Elvis was five.

242
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:41,292
Motobike.

243
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:42,333
I'm sorry.

244
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:48,042
I was pregnant with Sam at the time.

245
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:52,292
So I had the kids to think about and decided to keep the business running.

246
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:54,042
What was that?

247
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,667
Butchery.

248
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,167
Shortest butcher in New Zealand.

249
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,208
Really?

250
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:05,208
Yeah well, I'm a ninja with a boning knife .

251
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:07,417
No surprises there.

252
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:14,292
I see your brother from time to time.

253
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:17,375
Yeah, he's up to his neck in ostriches.

254
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:22,917
Is he still married? I never see his wife.

255
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:26,333
No, yeah, I don't think she goes out much

256
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,042
How many times have I told you about leaving the gate to the pen open?

257
00:31:06,292 --> 00:31:08,875
If you think you're going to see this again you're mistaken.

258
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:16,208
You disgust me.

259
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,417
Who the hell is this guy?

260
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:24,167
Just an old school friend. It's no big deal.

261
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,208
No big deal?

262
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,208
Where's my jacket?

263
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:29,750
Celia, It's rubbish night.

264
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:32,625
And please tie the bags. I don't want dogs getting into them. Bye, bye.

265
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:37,917
Hey, we'll be waiting.

266
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:44,083
Need a hand with that?

267
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,292
Done your homework?

268
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:50,833
Will you please take your foot away?

269
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:54,125
What? Just to see if you've done your homework.

270
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:57,000
Just asking.

271
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:05,875
I'm sure we used to be able to do this.

272
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:28,375
Did you think of me?

273
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:33,125
I was terrified of seeing you.

274
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:52,333
You remember those poems and stories you used to write?

275
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,708
I was going to put music to them, release an album.

276
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:58,417
What were we were going to call ourselves?

277
00:33:00,917 --> 00:33:03,292
What was it? Was it "silly bastards"?

278
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:05,250
"Stupid Buggers"

279
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:12,958
"Sick Motherfuckers", "Sick Fuckers", wasn't it?

280
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:17,208
"Sick Puppy", actually.

281
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:22,542
Live at the Hammersmith.

282
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:28,458
Yeah, see that's me. Eight years behind what was going on. But, you know,

283
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:33,042
still thinking I had created it all for myself.

284
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,917
Hi.

285
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:33,292
I've got an assignment where I have to interview an important local community member.

286
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:39,208
And it was a choice between you and Mr Aiken who set up the irrigation main.

287
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,083
I was just wondering if I could interview you?

288
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:47,375
Can I come in?

289
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,000
Is there real coffee?

290
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:16,208
Sure. How do you have it?

291
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:19,458
Macchito, thanks.

292
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:31,500
I'm Celia by the way.

293
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:51,000
I gather you do have some questions.

294
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,750
Ah Yes. Ah Yeah.

295
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:58,000
So, how did you get to do what you do?

296
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,542
I was working for a paper in London on local articles,

297
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:03,708
and they needed somebody to go to Bosnia.

298
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:06,833
That right, yeah. You were working as a typesetter in Wellington,

299
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,083
and you studied journalism in London,

300
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:11,917
and found your break as a feature article writer,

301
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,292
and then a field journalist for Reuters.

302
00:37:14,417 --> 00:37:17,417
And for the past three and a half years you've been solidly freelance living

303
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:19,917
between London, Istanbul and Paris.

304
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:22,000
Well done. Yes. That's it.

305
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,750
You've really done your homework.

306
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:29,792
People must worry about you a lot doing this kind of work.

307
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,250
Your wife? Children?

308
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,333
No, not married.

309
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,125
Single? Yes.

310
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:40,667
What's it like going to war? Just to watch?

311
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:43,708
I'm not there to watch. I'm there to record.

312
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:47,458
Is that how you got those scars?

313
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:54,292
I fell off my bike when I was 12 coming down a gravel track.

314
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:56,833
No other scars?

315
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:03,333
Are you going to drink your macchito?

316
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:14,875
What's the hardest thing you have to deal with?

317
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,375
Jesus. Are these going to get any easier?

318
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:22,833
I don't know, finding a loo when you need one,which always seems to be pretty fucking impossible.

319
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:38,375
Why don't you celebrate your birthday on Christmas?

320
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:43,333
Now tell me, which article did you read that one in?

321
00:38:43,417 --> 00:38:46,250
It was your birthday when you took that photo of that girl.

322
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:47,667
The one you won the Pulitzer for.

323
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:49,750
I was shortlisted.

324
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:52,917
I read that when you got nominated

325
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,208
you withdrew the entry.

326
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,833
Long story.

327
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:07,708
I've got a 120 minute tape.

328
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:20,000
I was in Grozny

329
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:24,208
I heard about an offensive that was being mounted against the Russians.

330
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:27,750
I was warned by some friends not to write about it

331
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:30,333
in case the Russians caught whiff about what was going to happen.

332
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:31,208
So what did you do?

333
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,667
Wrote the article.

334
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:36,125
Then I declined sending it through to Reuters.

335
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,125
They found out anyway.

336
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,083
And they retaliated by massacring over 100 civilians in the village outside the city.

337
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,375
.And I'd been out all night drinking with people who were killed a few hours later.

338
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,625
The girl in the photo was the

339
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:53,292
was the only survivor.

340
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:54,667
Did you know her?

341
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:55,708
No.

342
00:39:57,917 --> 00:39:59,667
Was there anyone else around?

343
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,208
Not at the time, no.

344
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:02,375
Just you?

345
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:03,625
Just me.

346
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:07,917
So then what?

347
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:14,292
I think your batteries are running flat.

348
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:25,625
Are you...

349
00:40:26,042 --> 00:40:28,333
Are you Ben Steimer's daughter?

350
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:30,292
Did you know him?

351
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:32,375
Yeah, we went to school together.

352
00:40:38,542 --> 00:40:39,708
It's a photo of a baby.

353
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:40,750
Whose?

354
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:42,792
I don't know. Do I need to?

355
00:40:43,167 --> 00:40:44,333
Yeah, look at the bracelet.

356
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:52,625
No, look! "Celia, 27/2/87".

357
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:55,542
That's roughly 8 months after I left.

358
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,333
I sent that photo nearly 16 years ago.

359
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:06,917
Why did you send it?

360
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,208
Why did you send it, Jax?

361
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:20,250
You want an explanation?

362
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:26,667
Do you know what's it like to be invisible, Paul?

363
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:30,375
Even just a postcard.

364
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:32,958
A phone call.

365
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:38,583
Hi Sid, up there next to the porkers.

366
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:44,833
Patti Smith "Free Money"

367
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:56,042
It's in the past. OK?

368
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:58,708
Just leave it.

369
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:14,417
Will you be needing a copy of that?

370
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:16,000
No, thank you.

371
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:20,083
Oh my god. I think I need rescuing from these TV blokes.

372
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:22,917
Is it a good book, is it?

373
00:43:23,292 --> 00:43:26,083
"The Cloud of Unknowing", Sounds mysterious.

374
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,875
Where are you from?

375
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:31,125
Where am I from?

376
00:43:32,417 --> 00:43:34,417
A long way from here.

377
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:36,958
Me too. Mind if I join you?

378
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:42,625
Want a drink?

379
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:43,667
I'd love one.

380
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:08,333
Kiss me.

381
00:45:17,542 --> 00:45:18,833
Am I warm?

382
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,500
Getting closer.

383
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:26,542
Warmer?

384
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:27,708
Getting warmer.

385
00:45:27,917 --> 00:45:28,958
Warmer?

386
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:31,250
Warmer, in springtime.

387
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,292
Here!

388
00:45:57,542 --> 00:46:00,042
Alone we are born

389
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:02,167
And die alone

390
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:07,208
Yet see the red-gold cirrus Over snow mountain shine

391
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:10,417
Upon the upland road

392
00:46:10,542 --> 00:46:12,750
Ride easy, stranger

393
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:15,875
Surrender to the sky, your heart of anger

394
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:22,958
Don't be frightened of possibilities, son.

395
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:25,583
She's a wonderful mistress.

396
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:10,375
It's ok.

397
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:12,667
It's ok.

398
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,208
It's ok.

399
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:35,500
It's ok.

400
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:51,458
Go back to sleep.

401
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:21,292
I'm helping out for a couple of weeks.

402
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:23,917
And I'm new at this, so be patient with me.

403
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,875
Who knows how many words there are in the English language?

404
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,958
10 thousand.

405
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:31,000
10 thousand.

406
00:48:33,875 --> 00:48:37,250
Dictionary. There's actually over 750,000 words.

407
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:40,792
And I was a -- I thought maybe you could all choose a word.

408
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:43,958
Any word, doesn't matter what. Preferably something that means something to you.

409
00:48:44,042 --> 00:48:46,542
And compose something on this word.

410
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,792
Anything. It could be just a static image of you if you think that's easier.

411
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:54,750
Just so I get an idea of who you all are.

412
00:48:54,917 --> 00:48:57,375
And what the F--- I've gotten myself into.

413
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:10,292
Hope.

414
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:13,458
Her mind is a graveyard. Her heart is an island.

415
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:19,875
She and I are not good friends but I've known her all my life.

416
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:27,625
She sits in my belly hollow and distant.

417
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:31,667
And her whispered words of encouragement will never comfort me.

418
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,208
Mom?

419
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:47,083
I'm on to her tricks. Her false promises.

420
00:50:48,042 --> 00:50:51,583
"Go away", I tell her. "I'm busy today."" I've got things to do."

421
00:50:54,542 --> 00:50:57,417
This acquaintance never knows when to leave.

422
00:50:58,667 --> 00:51:02,208
It's not a question of why she befriended me in the first place.

423
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:07,417
It's more a question of why I choose to let her stay.

424
00:51:33,792 --> 00:51:37,000
Tea bag! Tea bag!

425
00:51:37,292 --> 00:51:40,292
Tea bag!

426
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:46,167
Tea bag!

427
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:53,208
- Tea bag! - Leave her alone, you fucking animal!

428
00:52:00,458 --> 00:52:03,250
Tea bag! Tea bag!

429
00:53:45,042 --> 00:53:46,875
Your knee's bleeding.

430
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,833
I know. I fell.

431
00:53:58,792 --> 00:54:00,750
Come on. Let's take a look at it, then.

432
00:54:33,917 --> 00:54:35,333
Weeks passed

433
00:54:35,417 --> 00:54:38,250
and there was still no sign of the ocean.

434
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:42,583
The people grew worried.

435
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:46,875
It was decided to send a small group to search for it

436
00:54:47,042 --> 00:54:49,500
in the hope of bringing it back.

437
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:01,167
All right attention please.

438
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:04,083
I would appreciate it if everyone listened.

439
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,750
That includes you, Mr Brook.

440
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:12,458
Look. Have any of you seen Celia since yesterday?

441
00:55:18,458 --> 00:55:21,583
No? Well, if she gets in touch with any of you,

442
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:23,667
you know where to find me, okay?

443
00:55:23,917 --> 00:55:25,417
Thanks.

444
00:55:27,667 --> 00:55:30,875
All right. Settle down. We've all seen a police officer before.

445
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,833
Paul? Look, Just wondering. Can I have a word for a second?

446
00:55:44,292 --> 00:55:45,292
I'm already late for a class.

447
00:55:45,417 --> 00:55:46,333
It won't take long.

448
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:49,375
Back to class.

449
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,833
Paul?

450
00:55:57,917 --> 00:56:00,625
Hey, Pat, It's fine. I'm just helping out with something.

451
00:56:00,708 --> 00:56:02,417
Thanks, Pat.

452
00:56:07,042 --> 00:56:09,667
Hey, did you see Celia on the weekend?

453
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:12,208
No.

454
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:15,208
She used to visit though, right.

455
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,125
Yeah.

456
00:56:22,167 --> 00:56:24,875
She came by sometimes to borrow books.

457
00:56:25,042 --> 00:56:27,292
How often did she pop by?

458
00:56:32,042 --> 00:56:33,583
She liked to drop by most Sundays I guess, yeah.

459
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,000
Liked? Likes.

460
00:56:37,792 --> 00:56:39,917
I said likes, I think.

461
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,417
Ah see cause I think I know what Celia likes.

462
00:56:43,542 --> 00:56:46,667
I mean I've known her since she was a little kid. She's my daughter's best friend.

463
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:52,042
I also know that you sent her an e-mail on the weekend asking her to come by and visit.

464
00:56:52,667 --> 00:56:55,542
She wasn't too happy about that from what I understand.

465
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:58,833
You see I know this, Paul

466
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,625
because Miso agreed to drop her off.

467
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:04,500
Actually she did drop by briefly.

468
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:11,750
It's nice out there at the orchard.

469
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:14,083
Quiet. Private.

470
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:20,917
So why did you stay on?

471
00:57:21,792 --> 00:57:23,917
Favour for a friend.

472
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:28,083
How long did you guys go out for?

473
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:29,417
What?

474
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:29,917
om

475
00:57:32,917 --> 00:57:34,000
Oh, she mentioned me.

476
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:35,542
When did you break up?

477
00:57:37,083 --> 00:57:38,917
God, seventeen.

478
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:40,750
Keep your leg still.

479
00:57:49,167 --> 00:57:52,125
Listen, what you wrote the other day, I thought it was

480
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:56,750
well considered.

481
00:57:57,542 --> 00:58:00,208
Well considered. Intriguing.

482
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,833
I like what you've done here.

483
00:58:14,833 --> 00:58:17,125
Where did all these books come from?

484
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:19,917
He never told me.

485
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:21,917
Wanted to keep it a mystery, I suppose.

486
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:24,667
Father's have got a lot to answer for, huh?

487
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:51,458
Hey beautiful.

488
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:55,000
Sorry I'm late.

489
00:59:15,792 --> 00:59:17,708
She can't have gone far.

490
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:28,708
Me and some mates are going to take a look around Lawrence later.

491
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:32,458
Can you bring those?

492
00:59:34,417 --> 00:59:35,917
Sure.

493
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:41,083
I asked for an essay about the pros and cons of immigration, Jake

494
00:59:41,167 --> 00:59:43,333
not the best places to surf.

495
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,083
Louise, Tonga has a king, not a president.

496
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:50,458
I think you'll find there's more to life in Hong Kong than dance clubs, Miso.

497
00:59:50,583 --> 00:59:53,417
What? Like secret book clubs?

498
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:02,250
Paul!

499
01:00:06,625 --> 01:00:08,583
Sergeant O'Neil's back.

500
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:11,083
He's waiting for you in the common room.

501
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:13,750
I told him you were busy.

502
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:23,375
You had nice handwriting as a kid.

503
01:00:26,208 --> 01:00:28,500
Is this one of the books she borrowed?

504
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,833
I didn't

505
01:00:32,958 --> 01:00:35,667
I didn't keep a record, to tell you the truth. I didn't.

506
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:38,333
What? Other things on your mind, did you?

507
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:44,167
We found this on the side of the road, bet it came from your place.

508
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,917
Just want to know how it got there, that's all.

509
01:00:51,292 --> 01:00:53,583
Did she ever talk to you about leaving?

510
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:57,292
Name a teenager around here who doesn't.

511
01:00:57,917 --> 01:01:00,000
I know a few actually.

512
01:01:20,625 --> 01:01:23,167
Stop.

513
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:43,458
OK. You can open your eyes.

514
01:01:45,292 --> 01:01:47,208
Happy Birthday.

515
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:58,292
Who is this anyway?

516
01:01:58,667 --> 01:02:00,417
Kiri Te Kanawa. You chose it.

517
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:01,458
Who's she?

518
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:03,208
Who's she?

519
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:07,292
There are people in this country who would shoot you for asking that question.

520
01:02:07,667 --> 01:02:10,833
There are people in this country who would shoot you for listening to it.

521
01:02:16,417 --> 01:02:18,583
So what's she singing about?

522
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,042
Love.

523
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:29,083
What do you normally do on a Saturday night?

524
01:02:29,167 --> 01:02:32,167
Who do you hang out with when you're not having picnics with me?

525
01:02:32,292 --> 01:02:33,750
What do you do, go to parties or what?

526
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:35,500
If you can call them that.

527
01:02:35,583 --> 01:02:39,417
Why? Do you wanna come along? You actually might get to see them tea bagging.

528
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:41,625
Tea bagging? What's that?

529
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:46,458
Well, That's when guys get a girl completely comatose

530
01:02:46,583 --> 01:02:51,583
and then they take turns in lowering their testicles into her eye sockets and film it.

531
01:02:52,417 --> 01:02:55,125
And if they're really kind they send a copy to a paranoid friend.

532
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:59,583
First class is seminal? It's not funny.

533
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:04,292
I don't know what we're talking about.

534
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:05,333
Oh god.

535
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:13,375
Well I hope you keep your distance from those kind of guys is what I'm saying.

536
01:03:17,458 --> 01:03:20,208
So, tell me about you and mum, back in the dark ages.

537
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:22,625
It wasn't that long ago.

538
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:32,000
Patti Smith "Horses"

539
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:51,583
My mom wanted to sing like this?

540
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:55,333
Your mother wanted to be Patti Smith.

541
01:04:47,375 --> 01:04:49,708
Come with me. Come on.

542
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:52,250
I'll show you something.

543
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Where did this place come from?

544
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:15,667
No one knows about it except me and my dad.

545
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:18,208
So what are you doing here?

546
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:20,292
Write.

547
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:22,833
Think.

548
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:28,000
Mystery boy.

549
01:05:28,208 --> 01:05:30,167
So many secrets.

550
01:05:36,708 --> 01:05:38,417
What are you doing?

551
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:42,583
Giving you something to write about, moron.

552
01:05:47,083 --> 01:05:48,875
Mom the rock star.

553
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:51,542
It's hard to believe she even had a dream.

554
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,792
Do you want to know what my dream is?

555
01:05:57,167 --> 01:05:57,833
Yeah.

556
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,375
I'm sitting in a cafe in Spain.

557
01:06:08,042 --> 01:06:12,542
And don't know a single person there. And I can't understand a single word that anyone's saying.

558
01:06:14,667 --> 01:06:16,875
I've got a glass of wine

559
01:06:18,792 --> 01:06:20,917
and I can see the sea.

560
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:28,542
Don't worry.

561
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,208
No, go on. And?

562
01:06:34,583 --> 01:06:36,375
I'm just writing.

563
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:40,708
And yeah.

564
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:46,667
And you know it doesn't matter if no one ever reads what I'm writing

565
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:49,875
I don't want to be famous.

566
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:52,625
I just, I just want to be there.

567
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:04,625
Anyway, I'd rather be a no one somewhere than someone nowhere.

568
01:07:06,917 --> 01:07:09,083
I've already packed my suitcase.

569
01:07:10,542 --> 01:07:11,750
I'm not joking.

570
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:13,417
I'm not laughing at you.

571
01:07:15,375 --> 01:07:17,958
I had a similar dream once.

572
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:19,792
Really?

573
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:22,917
Tell me.

574
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:31,250
Sometimes I'd see...faces.

575
01:07:34,875 --> 01:07:38,542
At night before I fell asleep, people I never met.

576
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,708
And I'd wonder who they were.

577
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:47,000
Where they might live, what they did.

578
01:07:48,334 --> 01:07:49,917
and it was strange

579
01:07:50,209 --> 01:07:53,375
because it was like they knew I was thinking about them.

580
01:07:55,792 --> 01:07:58,459
Why did you become a war journalist?

581
01:08:01,542 --> 01:08:04,667
Who you set out to be is not always who you become.

582
01:08:04,792 --> 01:08:07,375
You know, Things happen. Plans change.

583
01:08:13,417 --> 01:08:15,292
I see them too.

584
01:08:17,042 --> 01:08:18,917
Faces.

585
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:25,334
I wanted to give you something.

586
01:08:33,875 --> 01:08:36,209
Yeah, right.

587
01:08:36,542 --> 01:08:38,959
I just, I think you should enter.

588
01:09:13,334 --> 01:09:15,542
You never talk about your mum.

589
01:09:15,709 --> 01:09:17,500
My mum? She's very religious.

590
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:21,250
She had these little sermons about the beauty God hides away in quiet corners.

591
01:09:21,584 --> 01:09:24,250
Is that what your dad was hiding from in here?

592
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:26,500
No, they

593
01:09:26,959 --> 01:09:29,459
I think she was just quiet, you know.

594
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:32,709
My dad and her were very different.

595
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:35,500
My dad didn't believe in anything. He's an atheist.

596
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:38,000
My brother and her were very close.

597
01:09:39,209 --> 01:09:41,584
I heard she had an accident .

598
01:09:42,542 --> 01:09:44,334
Yeah she did.

599
01:09:44,875 --> 01:09:48,084
She was diagnosed as bi-polar, manic depression.

600
01:09:49,209 --> 01:09:52,750
Doctors prescribed lithium but she stopped taking it, I think.

601
01:09:53,834 --> 01:09:55,792
What happened?

602
01:09:59,417 --> 01:10:01,792
She was standing in the river

603
01:10:03,417 --> 01:10:06,709
at the back of the property and she pointed up to this hawk in the sky.

604
01:10:06,875 --> 01:10:09,250
And then when I looked back she was gone.

605
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:11,917
Found the body two days later, I think

606
01:10:17,542 --> 01:10:20,084
Is that why you push people away?

607
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,542
I do as I fucking please Celia. You know I hate to spoil your illusions.

608
01:10:31,292 --> 01:10:34,209
But the world out there isn't a bed of roses waiting to be picked

609
01:10:35,125 --> 01:10:38,500
or whatever it was you said, a glass of chardonnay in a fucking tapas bar.

610
01:10:39,917 --> 01:10:40,750
You understand?

611
01:10:40,959 --> 01:10:42,625
It wasn't an insult.

612
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:50,584
Sorry.

613
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:56,667
OK.

614
01:11:09,834 --> 01:11:11,542
Hey, Jax.

615
01:11:12,459 --> 01:11:13,917
Hi

616
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,584
I saw the smoke and I didn't want to disturb you

617
01:11:16,834 --> 01:11:18,667
but I remembered it was your birthday and so I

618
01:11:33,667 --> 01:11:35,375
Get in the car

619
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:37,625
No.

620
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:39,167
Celia, I'm sick of this.

621
01:11:39,292 --> 01:11:42,334
I said get in the car. I said get in the car

622
01:11:44,875 --> 01:11:47,417
You have no right to be here. Night, Paul.

623
01:11:55,625 --> 01:11:58,542
You have the audacity to bring here and give her alcohol?

624
01:11:58,625 --> 01:12:01,209
Jax, it's not what you think.

625
01:12:05,959 --> 01:12:08,667
You even presume to know what I think?

626
01:12:22,959 --> 01:12:24,417
Shit!

627
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:26,959
Excuse me.

628
01:12:28,292 --> 01:12:32,459
I need a notebook. I know it's here somewhere.

629
01:12:35,917 --> 01:12:36,542
Sorry, dad.

630
01:12:36,959 --> 01:12:38,625
There's nothing to be sorry for

631
01:12:39,292 --> 01:12:41,292
as long as you're being cautious.

632
01:12:41,375 --> 01:12:43,000
Yeah of course.

633
01:12:44,834 --> 01:12:46,500
I'll be on my way.

634
01:12:54,209 --> 01:12:56,084
You shouldn't be here.

635
01:12:57,167 --> 01:12:59,084
He doesn't care.

636
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:01,375
I mean you saw for yourself.

637
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:02,584
I care.

638
01:13:02,792 --> 01:13:04,167
What are you telling me?

639
01:13:04,292 --> 01:13:07,417
That I'm not as important as what goes on in your head?

640
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:11,000
There's just parts of me you can't have.

641
01:13:12,542 --> 01:13:14,209
No one can.

642
01:13:23,042 --> 01:13:25,125
Hey. You ok?

643
01:13:28,834 --> 01:13:31,292
I'd rather look at it at your place.

644
01:13:36,459 --> 01:13:38,500
What's this?

645
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:44,125
Jesus Christ.

646
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:46,625
Did she do this?

647
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:49,167
Celia tell me, who did it?

648
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:53,125
I don't want to talk about it. It wasn't mom.

649
01:13:58,084 --> 01:13:58,959
Hey where is he?

650
01:13:59,125 --> 01:14:00,292
Paul, what are you doing?

651
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,709
Paul, what are you doing in my house?

652
01:14:02,042 --> 01:14:03,042
Where is he, Jackie?

653
01:14:03,209 --> 01:14:03,667
What's going on?

654
01:14:03,834 --> 01:14:04,709
Is this the asshole?

655
01:14:04,917 --> 01:14:05,917
What? Who the fuck is this?

656
01:14:05,959 --> 01:14:07,375
Shut the fuck up, Gareth!

657
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,459
Paul, would you leave?

658
01:14:08,542 --> 01:14:09,084
So this is the famous Paul.

659
01:14:11,292 --> 01:14:14,417
You like beating up little girls, do you. You know it's assault, is what it is.

660
01:14:14,625 --> 01:14:16,167
You touch her again. I'll kill you.

661
01:14:16,709 --> 01:14:18,250
Is that right, mate?

662
01:14:18,334 --> 01:14:20,959
What do you call this, dickhead?

663
01:14:21,042 --> 01:14:22,459
I always mind my own fucking business.

664
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:29,000
Get out of my house, you fucking pricks.

665
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,292
Mind your fucking business.

666
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:41,459
You cunt, you fuck off! Is that clear?

667
01:14:42,584 --> 01:14:44,042
Still wanna fucking kill me, cunt?

668
01:14:44,125 --> 01:14:45,042
Gareth, Get the fuck inside.

669
01:14:46,167 --> 01:14:47,042
Get the fuck inside!

670
01:14:50,167 --> 01:14:53,542
You think you can come here and do this shit in front of my kids?

671
01:14:53,959 --> 01:14:56,084
Have you seen her fucking bruises? What did you think I was going to do?

672
01:14:56,167 --> 01:14:58,792
She got a lot more than she got. I want you to stay away from her.

673
01:14:59,334 --> 01:15:01,667
You changed the birth certificate.

674
01:15:02,084 --> 01:15:04,125
When were you going to tell her about that?

675
01:15:07,917 --> 01:15:10,375
Just stay out of our lives, all right?

676
01:15:13,584 --> 01:15:15,292
Yeah.

677
01:15:15,417 --> 01:15:18,042
See you around Paul, you fucking prick.

678
01:15:25,334 --> 01:15:26,750
Hello?

679
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,542
Hello?

680
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:31,334
Hello?

681
01:15:32,792 --> 01:15:34,542
Celia?

682
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,792
She might have gone to Spain.

683
01:15:54,084 --> 01:15:55,542
No, no, no, wait.

684
01:15:55,667 --> 01:15:58,417
My daughter plans on running off to Spain and he sees nothing.

685
01:15:58,500 --> 01:15:59,792
I don't call that irrelevant.

686
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,292
Come on Jackie, it's not like it's the first time she's done something like this.

687
01:16:02,375 --> 01:16:03,875
Oh great.

688
01:16:04,542 --> 01:16:07,209
How good, this is good. So you are defending him now?

689
01:16:08,792 --> 01:16:11,625
Okay, so when exactly did she say she was running off to Spain?

690
01:16:11,709 --> 01:16:14,667
She didn't. She didn't say. All I knew is she had the ticket.

691
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:17,250
I thought she was going to leave when school was finished. That's all.

692
01:16:17,334 --> 01:16:19,167
I didn't know what to think.

693
01:16:19,292 --> 01:16:22,042
Yeah well I know what I think. I think you are out of your mind.

694
01:16:22,459 --> 01:16:25,125
She made me promise not to tell a soul.

695
01:16:25,917 --> 01:16:27,625
I'm her mother.

696
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,375
OK?

697
01:16:29,917 --> 01:16:32,500
When exactly did she make this promise Paul?

698
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:34,417
Was it when you were plying her with alcohol?

699
01:16:34,542 --> 01:16:36,959
I wasn't plying her with alcohol. I gave her a glass, Jackie. A child could have drunk it.

700
01:16:37,042 --> 01:16:37,875
A child did drink it.

701
01:16:39,542 --> 01:16:41,459
Oh yeah. And did he think of that when he was punching the shit out of her?

702
01:16:41,834 --> 01:16:42,500
And the rest.

703
01:16:42,625 --> 01:16:44,292
Fuck off. Don't bring me into it.

704
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:45,042
Sneaking up on her.

705
01:16:45,209 --> 01:16:47,125
Pissing in the toilet while she was lying in the bath.

706
01:16:47,209 --> 01:16:50,500
If it took her going half way around the world to get away from you, you fucking a--.

707
01:16:53,834 --> 01:16:54,667
You two stay in here.

708
01:16:54,875 --> 01:16:56,875
You, get in my office. I want a word alone.

709
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,042
What's he talking about?

710
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:03,875
What the fuck is he talking about

711
01:17:04,167 --> 01:17:04,959
Nothing!

712
01:17:08,959 --> 01:17:11,750
Tell me about the last time you saw her. Everything.

713
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:13,792
We were at the gate. She was carrying the atlas.

714
01:17:13,959 --> 01:17:15,125
She said goodbye and she left.

715
01:17:15,209 --> 01:17:16,167
No special goodbyes?

716
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:17,209
No special goodbyes.

717
01:17:17,292 --> 01:17:19,209
No, she had a couple of books she hadn't got around to read

718
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:20,542
and I told her she could keep them.

719
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:21,625
Names of these books?

720
01:17:21,667 --> 01:17:23,167
Oh fuck say, what does it matter? I don't know.

721
01:17:25,334 --> 01:17:27,875
"Owls Do Cry", by Janet Frame, and another one,

722
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,084
Camus, "The Outsider", I think it was.

723
01:17:31,667 --> 01:17:34,667
That's Camus not canoe. C-a-m-u-s.

724
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,125
You smug prick.

725
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:41,042
Not all of us had to run off to Europe, mate.

726
01:18:16,417 --> 01:18:18,167
Travel Diary

727
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,334
passport

728
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,375
"Missing girl, teacher, shared secret den"

729
01:18:42,584 --> 01:18:44,042
I guess you've seen this.

730
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:49,084
Small town bloody gossip.

731
01:18:51,584 --> 01:18:53,959
I don't know what to do about this, Paul.

732
01:18:55,584 --> 01:18:58,125
The board of trustees have called a meeting.

733
01:19:00,959 --> 01:19:03,875
You don't deserve this.

734
01:19:04,084 --> 01:19:04,917
You know it's fine, Pat.

735
01:19:05,209 --> 01:19:07,875
It's time I left anyway. Honestly.

736
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:12,000
Hey! Jonathan.

737
01:19:12,209 --> 01:19:13,875
Jonathan?

738
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:29,542
Jonathan!

739
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,709
Jonathan!

740
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:34,334
Get in!

741
01:19:35,417 --> 01:19:37,959
Jonathan, get in the car, it's bloody freezing.

742
01:19:39,167 --> 01:19:40,750
Come on.

743
01:19:41,625 --> 01:19:43,334
Put your seat belt on.

744
01:19:48,459 --> 01:19:50,625
Were you having sex with her?

745
01:19:51,334 --> 01:19:53,000
What?

746
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:57,834
You know who.

747
01:20:00,834 --> 01:20:02,584
Who said that?

748
01:20:03,417 --> 01:20:05,250
Who said that?

749
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:12,792
Kids at school, said you were giving her special coaching in bed.

750
01:20:19,834 --> 01:20:21,667
And you believed them?

751
01:20:26,292 --> 01:20:27,959
Huh, and you believed

752
01:20:36,834 --> 01:20:39,917
How's that camera going? I haven't seen you with it lately.

753
01:21:07,709 --> 01:21:11,042
As the days went on, more and more people went looking.

754
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,834
The people searched far and wide

755
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,584
but the ocean had vanished without a trace.

756
01:21:31,459 --> 01:21:34,125
The quiet land once bountiful

757
01:21:34,292 --> 01:21:36,584
had become hard and unyielding.

758
01:21:47,334 --> 01:21:49,792
Then a shape appeared on the horizon.

759
01:21:51,834 --> 01:21:54,250
Through a blaze of hate the people saw

760
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:57,500
what looked like tumbling water rolling towards them.

761
01:21:59,709 --> 01:22:01,625
A wave of excitement passed through the town

762
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:05,042
as they anxiously watched the ocean return.

763
01:22:05,959 --> 01:22:08,167
But as it grew closer the shape began to alter and mutate.

764
01:22:11,625 --> 01:22:15,792
What looked like tumbling water was in fact wild horses.

765
01:22:17,959 --> 01:22:21,750
Everywhere they turned they saw horses drawing closer and closer.

766
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:25,167
Their excitement turned to fear.

767
01:22:26,292 --> 01:22:28,292
And their fear became panic,

768
01:22:30,959 --> 01:22:33,834
for it seemed that nothing could stop their advance.

769
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,709
Which as the ocean's disappearance

770
01:22:39,209 --> 01:22:41,292
had come without warning.

771
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,709
But then no one,

772
01:22:46,834 --> 01:22:48,792
not even for a moment,

773
01:22:48,959 --> 01:22:52,709
had stopped to question why the ocean had left in the first place.

774
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:11,084
Mr. Prior?

775
01:23:11,459 --> 01:23:14,584
I am Detective Inspector Farnon from Wellington CIV.

776
01:23:14,667 --> 01:23:16,667
This is Detective Dunleavy.

777
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:18,584
I've a warrant to search these premises.

778
01:23:18,667 --> 01:23:21,792
And I'll need you to accompany me to the station for questioning.

779
01:23:23,792 --> 01:23:26,709
I'll need your passport and keys to your car.

780
01:23:29,209 --> 01:23:32,750
I believe there's a shed where Celia used to visit you.

781
01:23:42,167 --> 01:23:44,250
Right then, let's get you home.

782
01:24:04,209 --> 01:24:07,167
Why did Celia come to your place last Sunday?

783
01:24:10,459 --> 01:24:11,667
Did you hear the question?

784
01:24:12,125 --> 01:24:12,709
Yes.

785
01:24:13,667 --> 01:24:16,542
I understand she visited you regularly.

786
01:24:17,292 --> 01:24:19,584
What was the nature of the visits?

787
01:24:19,792 --> 01:24:21,125
We talked about things.

788
01:24:21,375 --> 01:24:22,167
What things?

789
01:24:22,292 --> 01:24:23,875
Europe.

790
01:24:24,167 --> 01:24:26,000
Books.

791
01:24:27,709 --> 01:24:30,000
Celia wants to be a writer.

792
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:43,792
I am not flesh. I am not blood.

793
01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:46,750
They can look all they like but they'll never see me.

794
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:50,417
If I never hear your love or hold your hand again in this life,

795
01:24:50,542 --> 01:24:53,292
promise me we will touch when I am dead.

796
01:24:55,417 --> 01:24:58,167
It's called 'Poem for a Lonely Friend'.

797
01:24:59,459 --> 01:25:02,209
Would you consider yourself lonely, Paul?

798
01:25:11,375 --> 01:25:13,042
Thank you.

799
01:25:13,959 --> 01:25:16,542
Would you keep that door closed, please.

800
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,167
Why did Celia keep visiting you even though her parents had forbidden it?

801
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:26,125
Parents?

802
01:25:26,292 --> 01:25:27,167
Mother.

803
01:25:27,709 --> 01:25:30,125
I guess she saw something in me.

804
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:32,917
And what was that?

805
01:25:33,209 --> 01:25:35,125
Well, I'm not Celia.

806
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:38,375
Then perhaps you'd like to tell me what it was you saw in her?

807
01:25:41,334 --> 01:25:43,584
I know this is diffi--

808
01:25:46,959 --> 01:25:49,042
I remember being her.

809
01:26:07,375 --> 01:26:09,000
What did you do this time?

810
01:26:09,459 --> 01:26:10,667
Come on, leave me alone now .

811
01:26:10,792 --> 01:26:12,375
Go away.

812
01:26:13,459 --> 01:26:15,709
Just fucking go, come on, leave me alone.

813
01:26:15,834 --> 01:26:17,875
I don't need this shit, Celia.Just go.

814
01:26:18,209 --> 01:26:18,917
What?

815
01:26:20,084 --> 01:26:21,167
Did mom say something to you?

816
01:26:21,459 --> 01:26:23,250
Your mum threatened to ring the school, yeah.

817
01:26:23,334 --> 01:26:24,167
Okay?

818
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:25,625
No, it's not ok.

819
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:29,084
God, she's so fucking presumptuous.

820
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,959
Who the fuck cares what she thinks?

821
01:26:33,125 --> 01:26:36,000
She's got a fucking boyfriend he wears boat shoes.

822
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:38,875
He brought her a pair now they're both wearing them.

823
01:26:39,292 --> 01:26:41,959
You never see a fucking boat around here.

824
01:26:48,042 --> 01:26:50,209
I just came to tell you that I entered the contest .

825
01:26:50,417 --> 01:26:52,042
Well that's great, now get going.

826
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,125
It's not illegal that we're friends or something, Paul.

827
01:26:58,459 --> 01:27:01,917
It was you who said that we shouldn't care what other people think of us.

828
01:27:09,667 --> 01:27:11,625
Or were you just saying that?

829
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:56,500
You know how you and mom used to go out and now it me and you that are friends.

830
01:28:00,084 --> 01:28:02,750
I feel like I've known you my whole life.

831
01:28:02,917 --> 01:28:05,209
Yeah well, it's a small world.

832
01:28:05,334 --> 01:28:07,584
It isn't a small world.

833
01:28:10,917 --> 01:28:12,834
Were you guys in love?

834
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:20,959
There must've been something going on if you tattooed each others feet.

835
01:28:24,375 --> 01:28:26,375
It's a little hard to imagine what you saw in her.

836
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:29,584
Well, you're not the first person to feel that way about their parents.

837
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:33,167
Anyway, it's a long time ago.

838
01:28:36,209 --> 01:28:38,334
I know it wasn't planned.

839
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:41,459
Mom was only 16.

840
01:28:48,834 --> 01:28:51,500
You'd tell me if you knew anything, eh?

841
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,125
Is that a promise?

842
01:29:07,709 --> 01:29:09,209
Oh stuff it.

843
01:29:09,459 --> 01:29:12,167
Let's get wet. Come on.

844
01:29:13,625 --> 01:29:18,417
Mazzy Star "Take Everything"

845
01:29:56,084 --> 01:29:56,834
Oh, geez!

846
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:58,917
Andrew, Jonathan?

847
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,542
We were on our way home from church and thought we'd stop in for a cuppa.

848
01:30:03,084 --> 01:30:04,667
Fuck.

849
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:07,584
It's freezing!

850
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,667
Have you see this new thing that they're building?

851
01:30:19,792 --> 01:30:22,209
It looks like a giant barn.

852
01:30:25,292 --> 01:30:27,292
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

853
01:30:37,042 --> 01:30:39,084
I'll put the kettle on.

854
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,625
Family and friends of Celia Steimer

855
01:30:54,084 --> 01:30:55,709
are doing everything possible to help police find her.

856
01:30:55,834 --> 01:30:59,167
More than 50 volunteers are now scouring waterways and bushlands

857
01:30:59,292 --> 01:31:00,875
in the Marshall road forest.

858
01:31:01,042 --> 01:31:03,542
The 16-year-old Rapari Junction HS student

859
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:05,792
has been missing now for more than a week.

860
01:31:05,959 --> 01:31:07,709
Detective Robin Farland says

861
01:31:07,792 --> 01:31:10,417
they have to consider every option.

862
01:31:10,542 --> 01:31:13,667
She acknowledged a local man is helping them with their inquiries

863
01:31:13,875 --> 01:31:15,750
and the police will be visiting every house in the area.

864
01:31:34,584 --> 01:31:36,334
He'll be fine.

865
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:39,042
Let them handle it.

866
01:32:24,834 --> 01:32:26,084
Please just use an ashtray.

867
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:27,125
Okay.

868
01:32:28,375 --> 01:32:30,917
Listen, I spoke to the lawyer in Alexandria

869
01:32:31,042 --> 01:32:33,625
and he reckons he's handled this sort of thing before.

870
01:32:34,792 --> 01:32:37,334
He wants you to give him a call first thing in the morning.

871
01:32:39,084 --> 01:32:44,084
Hey, what sexual position creates the ugliest offspring?

872
01:32:47,667 --> 01:32:49,292
What sexual position creates--

873
01:32:49,459 --> 01:32:50,334
I don't know, Paul.

874
01:32:51,292 --> 01:32:53,417
Ask your mother.

875
01:32:56,167 --> 01:32:58,500
Can you imagine if she saw us now?

876
01:32:58,792 --> 01:33:01,292
Can you imagine that? What do you think she'd say?

877
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,209
Two brothers having a drink and a chat.

878
01:33:04,334 --> 01:33:06,959
What do you think? She'd be proud, or what?

879
01:33:10,042 --> 01:33:11,584
Why are you doing this?

880
01:33:11,917 --> 01:33:12,625
Doing what?

881
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,250
You know exactly what.

882
01:33:15,084 --> 01:33:16,334
Why can't you just talk to me?

883
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:26,042
Fuck you.

884
01:33:27,459 --> 01:33:30,875
What the fuck are you looking at? Never seen two brothers talking before?

885
01:33:38,542 --> 01:33:40,917
You want to talk, let's talk.

886
01:33:41,042 --> 01:33:43,167
Forget the fact you come in here blind drunk

887
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:46,542
and interrupt a meeting but then you just bring up mom like that?

888
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:49,792
I mean how dare you? I realize you are in a spot of bother, Paul,

889
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:52,584
but that doesn't give you the right to behave like this.

890
01:33:52,709 --> 01:33:55,042
The truth? You were never there for mom.

891
01:33:55,125 --> 01:33:57,167
When she was sick, where the hell were you?

892
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:59,125
Brilliant. So you do have an opinion. OK Andrew.

893
01:33:59,334 --> 01:34:00,792
What the fuck is that supposed to mean? I couldn't get near her.

894
01:34:00,875 --> 01:34:04,375
Blame it all on me. I had to be you. Did you know that?

895
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:07,042
You made fucking sure of it.

896
01:34:07,125 --> 01:34:09,042
The happy little fucking threesome: Andy, mom and God.

897
01:34:09,209 --> 01:34:09,875
No one else invited.

898
01:34:09,959 --> 01:34:11,167
You abandoned her.

899
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:14,667
You abandoned her, Paul. And you never took one single step towards--

900
01:34:16,292 --> 01:34:18,750
at least for all his faults, he let me in. He let me in.

901
01:34:18,834 --> 01:34:22,292
You were late for his funeral, remember? And you're gonna stand here defending for him.

902
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:25,084
Listen to me Paul, you listen, listen to me.

903
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,084
You know sometimes I look at you

904
01:34:29,167 --> 01:34:31,209
and all I see is him.

905
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:34,375
Just him.

906
01:34:34,542 --> 01:34:36,750
I find that quite disheartening.

907
01:34:41,917 --> 01:34:45,084
Yeah well, at least I didn't marry my fucking mother.

908
01:34:50,959 --> 01:34:54,000
Has she always been like that or just when she met you?

909
01:34:55,209 --> 01:34:57,292
Go to hell, Paul.

910
01:35:10,334 --> 01:35:14,584
Police confirm blood traces belong to missing girl.

911
01:35:16,209 --> 01:35:18,167
Just open it!

912
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,167
Celia, give me the fucking letter carta.

913
01:36:57,959 --> 01:36:59,625
It doesn't matter.

914
01:37:13,292 --> 01:37:14,709
Open it. Will you just open it?

915
01:37:14,875 --> 01:37:15,750
No! Don't open it.

916
01:37:16,375 --> 01:37:17,250
Open it!

917
01:37:17,417 --> 01:37:18,292
I don't want to.

918
01:37:24,334 --> 01:37:25,042
No?

919
01:37:25,375 --> 01:37:26,084
No.

920
01:37:47,292 --> 01:37:49,667
Wonder who came in first?

921
01:38:02,167 --> 01:38:03,875
Amid the 2000 or so entries

922
01:38:03,959 --> 01:38:05,959
we were delighted with Ms Steimers' story.

923
01:38:06,084 --> 01:38:09,167
This work shows an emerging remarkable talent for someone so young.

924
01:38:09,709 --> 01:38:12,084
It catches a sense of beauty, mystery and loss

925
01:38:12,167 --> 01:38:14,584
without ever losing sight of what might be.

926
01:38:15,084 --> 01:38:17,250
You wonder who came first?

927
01:38:21,459 --> 01:38:23,292
I'll tell you who came first.

928
01:38:23,417 --> 01:38:26,834
Someone three times your age, probably, someone who bloody well deserved to come first.

929
01:38:43,667 --> 01:38:46,167
Thank you for making it special for me.

930
01:38:49,584 --> 01:38:51,334
The den and everything.

931
01:39:03,584 --> 01:39:06,625
I need a cigarette to cope with this sort of scenery.

932
01:39:07,167 --> 01:39:09,084
In the car.I'll be back in a tic.

933
01:39:09,334 --> 01:39:11,375
Can you leave me your jacket?

934
01:40:14,792 --> 01:40:18,750
Are you gonna be home tonight? I need you to baby sit Sam.

935
01:40:22,625 --> 01:40:24,917
Celia, I asked you a question.

936
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:41,834
Fuck!

937
01:41:07,125 --> 01:41:09,209
Is he my father?

938
01:41:19,459 --> 01:41:21,917
I wish it were that simple.

939
01:41:33,709 --> 01:41:35,209
Hey, you!

940
01:41:39,167 --> 01:41:40,709
What's up?

941
01:41:59,959 --> 01:42:01,667
Did you know?

942
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:04,792
Did you know?

943
01:42:05,417 --> 01:42:08,209
Answer me! Did you know?

944
01:42:09,417 --> 01:42:11,250
Oh, Celia...

945
01:42:17,292 --> 01:42:20,375
I know what you did when you took the photo of that girl.

946
01:42:21,584 --> 01:42:23,750
You walked away and left her.

947
01:42:23,917 --> 01:42:27,000
That's why you withdrew the entry so you wouldn't even have to deal with her.

948
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:28,667
You don't know--

949
01:42:28,792 --> 01:42:29,709
don't!

950
01:42:31,334 --> 01:42:33,417
Was she just another photo?

951
01:42:35,042 --> 01:42:38,875
Just another picture of this fucking war puzzle that you try to figure out?

952
01:42:42,084 --> 01:42:44,125
Was she just like me?

953
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:46,209
Was she just like me?

954
01:42:46,375 --> 01:42:50,584
Was she just someone you could pick up and throw away and forget about?

955
01:43:01,334 --> 01:43:03,792
How do you live with yourself?

956
01:43:21,584 --> 01:43:23,667
Andrew! Penny!

957
01:43:24,209 --> 01:43:25,750
Are you there?

958
01:43:28,209 --> 01:43:30,042
Will you just open the door?

959
01:43:33,959 --> 01:43:36,000
I just need somewhere to stay.

960
01:43:40,834 --> 01:43:42,834
Come on Penny, I know you're in there.

961
01:44:05,667 --> 01:44:08,125
You know Jonathan, all that stuff in the papers,

962
01:44:08,334 --> 01:44:10,334
that's all just speculation.

963
01:44:10,834 --> 01:44:13,167
All right? It's rubbish.

964
01:44:13,292 --> 01:44:15,334
They have no proof.

965
01:44:21,042 --> 01:44:23,084
I'm still your uncle.

966
01:44:28,959 --> 01:44:30,667
No you're not.

967
01:44:30,792 --> 01:44:32,834
We both think you're fucking stupid.

968
01:44:32,959 --> 01:44:33,917
What did you say?

969
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:34,959
Leave me alone!

970
01:44:35,084 --> 01:44:38,042
I hope they kill you.

971
01:44:38,167 --> 01:44:40,542
I hope they--

972
01:44:40,750 --> 01:44:43,042
It's okay!

973
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:51,084
It's alright. I know you like her.

974
01:44:54,792 --> 01:44:57,125
Listen, you have to tell me what you meant by "both of you".

975
01:44:58,125 --> 01:44:59,292
Look at me.

976
01:44:59,417 --> 01:45:02,000
What did you mean by "both of us think you're stupid"?

977
01:45:02,084 --> 01:45:04,459
Tell me what you meant by "both of us".

978
01:45:04,584 --> 01:45:07,500
I'm not gonna hurt you. I promise I won't hurt you.

979
01:45:12,792 --> 01:45:14,292
What is it, Jonathan?

980
01:45:15,417 --> 01:45:17,750
I was looking for my camera.

981
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,792
I thought he was hiding it to protect you.

982
01:45:49,792 --> 01:45:51,375
Where is he?

983
01:45:51,542 --> 01:45:54,125
In Christchurch till tomorrow.

984
01:46:06,209 --> 01:46:07,750
Paul!

985
01:46:09,167 --> 01:46:10,834
Paul, are you there?

986
01:46:14,834 --> 01:46:16,125
RIVER

987
01:46:28,959 --> 01:46:31,250
I just heard from the lawyer.

988
01:46:31,375 --> 01:46:33,209
What do you mean you don't want to sell?

989
01:46:33,334 --> 01:46:35,417
You can't. I'm up to my eyeballs--

990
01:46:39,584 --> 01:46:40,917
What the hell did you do that for?

991
01:46:41,042 --> 01:46:41,959
Get up!

992
01:46:42,834 --> 01:46:44,667
Get up!

993
01:46:48,417 --> 01:46:51,667
What were you going to do? Plant it at my place like the atlas?

994
01:46:51,792 --> 01:46:53,750
This is really unnecessary

995
01:46:53,875 --> 01:46:55,750
Okay! Okay!

996
01:47:03,042 --> 01:47:05,834
There was a time I wondered why you up and left.

997
01:47:06,875 --> 01:47:09,334
You knew what he was up to, didn't you?

998
01:47:09,834 --> 01:47:11,709
At least look at me and tell me

999
01:47:11,792 --> 01:47:13,750
before you pull the trigger.

1000
01:47:17,625 --> 01:47:19,625
You know the really sad part?

1001
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:23,459
I didn't even find out until I read the will.

1002
01:47:23,625 --> 01:47:25,917
That's how far back I was.

1003
01:47:26,625 --> 01:47:28,584
But then how was I to know, Paul?

1004
01:47:28,709 --> 01:47:31,250
I was only a kid, a 15-year-old kid.

1005
01:47:32,417 --> 01:47:35,875
You killed me when you walked away and left me with that evil piece of scum.

1006
01:47:35,959 --> 01:47:38,917
You think you even get a second fucking chance?

1007
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,792
You knew, you bastard!

1008
01:47:40,917 --> 01:47:44,375
And you had the gall to come back here and bring that thing into our house.

1009
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:46,542
My mother's house!

1010
01:47:46,875 --> 01:47:50,000
And god knows what you're doing with her, but then like father like son.

1011
01:47:50,084 --> 01:47:52,584
Andrew, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

1012
01:48:02,875 --> 01:48:05,042
He was screwing that teenage whore of yours.

1013
01:48:05,125 --> 01:48:05,542
No!

1014
01:48:05,750 --> 01:48:06,584
- He was. You knew it. - No!

1015
01:48:06,667 --> 01:48:08,125
And you walked.

1016
01:48:08,209 --> 01:48:10,042
Andrew no! It's got nothing to fucking do with you!

1017
01:48:10,292 --> 01:48:11,625
You saw it with your own eyes!

1018
01:48:11,917 --> 01:48:14,209
You knew and you walked and you never looked back.

1019
01:48:14,292 --> 01:48:15,625
What did you do to her?

1020
01:48:15,709 --> 01:48:18,167
Our mother died the moment that bastard was conceived.

1021
01:48:18,250 --> 01:48:19,875
Just tell me.

1022
01:48:23,209 --> 01:48:28,250
Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate,

1023
01:48:28,334 --> 01:48:31,542
saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing.

1024
01:48:43,584 --> 01:48:44,959
Tell me!

1025
01:48:45,125 --> 01:48:46,000
Go ahead and cry.

1026
01:48:46,292 --> 01:48:48,167
It's about time you cried for our mother.

1027
01:48:48,375 --> 01:48:49,834
I'll kill you. I fucking swear I'll kill you.

1028
01:48:53,209 --> 01:48:55,084
I told her everything.

1029
01:48:55,459 --> 01:48:56,917
Everything!

1030
01:48:57,667 --> 01:49:00,000
Someone had to set the record straight.

1031
01:49:01,334 --> 01:49:03,292
I had a right to that money, Paul.

1032
01:49:03,417 --> 01:49:06,334
That money was mine if nothing else, at least that.

1033
01:49:10,167 --> 01:49:13,834
And I should give her a third at 18 along with a nice little letter.

1034
01:49:14,667 --> 01:49:17,834
Rather convenient, eh? Nice and smooth.

1035
01:49:19,709 --> 01:49:21,625
She wanted proof.

1036
01:49:24,750 --> 01:49:26,459
She asked to see the will.

1037
01:49:31,125 --> 01:49:32,667
Wait here.

1038
01:49:44,625 --> 01:49:46,584
Mom was there.

1039
01:49:46,750 --> 01:49:48,334
She...

1040
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:50,084
What?

1041
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,542
What?

1042
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:30,042
What are you doing in here?

1043
01:50:30,584 --> 01:50:32,125
I was just looking.

1044
01:50:32,792 --> 01:50:34,625
Who are you

1045
01:50:34,750 --> 01:50:36,792
He brought me here.

1046
01:50:41,584 --> 01:50:43,209
I know what you are.

1047
01:50:43,334 --> 01:50:45,875
You have no right to be in my house.

1048
01:50:46,542 --> 01:50:50,584
I want you to stay away from my family. Is that clear? Stay away.

1049
01:50:55,417 --> 01:50:57,750
So he told you about me.

1050
01:51:00,584 --> 01:51:02,459
Haven't you told her?

1051
01:51:05,167 --> 01:51:07,375
I told you to wait outside.

1052
01:51:09,875 --> 01:51:11,917
Is it true, Andrew?

1053
01:51:24,625 --> 01:51:26,292
You people.

1054
01:51:27,125 --> 01:51:29,000
Get out!

1055
01:51:40,292 --> 01:51:41,917
She smiled, Paul.

1056
01:51:43,584 --> 01:51:45,667
Simple misunderstanding.

1057
01:51:48,042 --> 01:51:50,084
What's done is done.

1058
01:52:03,209 --> 01:52:05,667
For what it's worth mum wants it this way.

1059
01:54:03,084 --> 01:54:04,792
Uncle Paul?

1060
01:54:04,917 --> 01:54:06,625
Jonathan...

1061
01:54:06,875 --> 01:54:08,709
Can you come over?

1062
01:55:14,375 --> 01:55:16,167
I rang the police.

1063
01:55:16,792 --> 01:55:18,542
Am I in trouble?

1064
01:55:32,834 --> 01:55:34,417
No, you're not.

1065
01:55:39,084 --> 01:55:43,792
Mazzy Star "Into Dust"

1066
01:57:16,125 --> 01:57:17,709
Paul, wait!

1067
01:57:18,417 --> 01:57:20,250
Paul, wait!

1068
01:57:21,417 --> 01:57:23,250
Paul, come back home!

1069
01:57:24,959 --> 01:57:27,209
Paul, don't leave!

1070
01:57:30,875 --> 01:57:33,167
Paul!

1071
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,875
The people had no choice

1072
01:57:46,959 --> 01:57:49,709
but to trust that the horses would lead them to their ocean.

1073
01:57:54,959 --> 01:57:56,750
Without reins or saddles

1074
01:57:56,875 --> 01:57:59,542
they rode the horses across the barren land.

1075
01:58:08,250 --> 01:58:10,750
But the ocean had disappeared for good.

1076
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,125
And the people, together and alone had no choice

1077
01:58:22,375 --> 01:58:25,459
but to face each other in their loss.

1078
01:58:27,709 --> 01:58:30,584
They made a home for themselves in a new environment.

1079
01:58:31,917 --> 01:58:34,375
Although one that had changed forever.

1080
01:58:37,209 --> 01:58:40,125
They learnt to live in the space that the ocean had left.

1081
01:58:43,959 --> 01:58:46,334
One day the tide went away

1082
01:58:46,459 --> 01:58:49,209
Although it lingered in their dreams.

1083
01:58:58,250 --> 01:58:59,709
Celia!

1084
01:59:01,792 --> 01:59:04,209
Your e-mail said it was urgent.

1085
01:59:06,417 --> 01:59:08,000
Yeah,

1086
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:10,625
I just wanted to see you.

1087
01:59:11,834 --> 01:59:13,875
I've just been reading your story.

1088
01:59:16,042 --> 01:59:18,500
So, you want to come in?Have a cup of tea?

1089
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,125
I'll make you a macchito.

1090
01:59:28,792 --> 01:59:30,709
I wanted to give you this.

1091
01:59:32,917 --> 01:59:34,375
It's a bit out of date.

1092
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:37,417
I don't think the world has changed that much in 25 years.

1093
01:59:39,792 --> 01:59:42,084
Have a look inside.

1094
01:59:51,709 --> 01:59:52,625
What's this?

1095
01:59:52,750 --> 01:59:53,959
What do you think it is?

1096
01:59:56,875 --> 01:59:59,625
It's open. So you can use it anytime you like.

1097
02:00:00,584 --> 02:00:02,959
You can leave after school's finished.

1098
02:00:08,917 --> 02:00:10,834
Hey, Celia, this is not some pathetic attempt

1099
02:00:10,959 --> 02:00:13,542
to make everything all right.

1100
02:00:16,042 --> 02:00:17,709
It's just--

1101
02:00:19,375 --> 02:00:21,625
the ticket is just a gift.

1102
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:27,000
You knew about

1103
02:00:27,167 --> 02:00:29,542
mum and your father together.

1104
02:00:32,209 --> 02:00:34,375
But I didn't know about you.

1105
02:00:39,042 --> 02:00:40,709
Why didn't you just tell me?

1106
02:00:41,125 --> 02:00:42,167
I didn't know how.

1107
02:00:44,209 --> 02:00:45,959
I'm sorry.

1108
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:54,167
Look...

1109
02:00:57,167 --> 02:00:58,959
in Spain,

1110
02:01:00,625 --> 02:01:03,334
there's a place called Andaluzia.

1111
02:01:05,084 --> 02:01:07,625
It's hot and it's white and dusty.

1112
02:01:08,667 --> 02:01:10,875
And you can see the ocean.

1113
02:01:13,250 --> 02:01:14,792
This is it.

1114
02:01:24,125 --> 02:01:25,209
I can drive you home.

1115
02:01:25,459 --> 02:01:27,000
It's Okay. I can walk.

1116
02:01:34,792 --> 02:01:36,250
Paul?

1117
02:01:38,917 --> 02:01:39,834
About the ticket.

1118
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:41,917
Don't worry about it, of course.

1119
02:01:42,334 --> 02:01:43,334
Promise?

1120
02:01:43,375 --> 02:01:44,375
Yeah.

1121
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:46,167
It's our secret.

1122
02:01:48,042 --> 02:01:50,417
Es nuestro secreto.

1123
02:01:52,167 --> 02:01:54,459
I thought you couldn't speak Spanish.

1124
02:02:05,042 --> 02:02:06,792
Adios, brother.

1125
02:02:18,584 --> 02:02:20,292
Bye, Celia.
