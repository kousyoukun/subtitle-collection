1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,792
某一天，在世界盡頭的一個小鎮
One Day, in a town at the edge of the world.

2
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,708
潮水退去不再回歸
The tide went out and never returned.

3
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,250
大海毫無徵兆地消失
The sea just left without warning.

4
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,750
起初人們只是困惑
At first people were little more than puzzled.

5
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:51,417
他們開始了無休無止的爭論
They continued to gossip and fight over the same old things.

6
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:58,000
後來寂靜蔓延
But soon a silence began to permeate the township.

7
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:09,042
荒蕪的未知世界降臨在人們眼前
A desert of unbelievable magnitude was beginning to form before their very eyes.

8
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,500
家人和朋友今日在此相聚
We come together as family and friends

9
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:19,792
為他送別，為他祭奠
to farewell him and to grieve him.

10
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,833
尤其是你們，他的家人
we think especially of you, his family

11
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:25,917
Andrew, Penny, Jonathan.

12
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:30,750
你們失去了一位父親，一位公公，和一位祖父
For the loss of a father, a father-in-law and grandfather.

13
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:36,875
我們的哀思包含著對過去
Part of our grief may be regret for things done

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,917
或者未盡之事的悔意
or left undone.

15
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,208
說過的話
words said...

16
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,167
還有未曾說出口的那些
...or words never said.

17
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,000
<font color=royalblue>在我父親的洞穴裡

18
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,042
你好

19
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:58,208
Andrew在嗎？
Is Andrew there?

20

你一定是Paul
You must be Paul.

Ah, they're in here.

25
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:23,583

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,917
倫敦怎麼樣？你現在住在那裡吧？
So, how's London? Is that where you're based?

33
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:06,958
其實近期我住在伊斯坦布爾的時間更多
Actually I'm spending more time in Istanbul these days.

34
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,500
該死，我的平衡能力實在是...
Oh Jesus, fuck it, my balance is completely...fuck.

35
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,167
沒事的
It's fine, really.

36
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:25,875
你家不錯，看來你過得很好。

I'll get Penny to make up a bed in a spare room.

- No that's fine. I made reservations from London. - No,really,it's no trouble.

39
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:35,708
不用了，Andrew，謝謝你
No it's done. Andrew it's done.Thank you.

40
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,417
So...

41
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,125
他走了
He's gone.

42
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,083

49
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,375
該死，忘了去見律師

對不起，我打算去的
Sorry, I wanted to be there.

52
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,625
睡過頭了，情況怎麼樣？
Slept in.How did it go?

53
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:40,458
他留給你三分之一的財產
He left you a third.

54
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,125
那三分之二應該你拿
Well...you deserve two thirds.

55
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,333
我也只拿了三分之一
He left me a third as well.

56
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,667
剩下的呢？
And the rest?

57
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:00,500
他留給了慈善機構
He left it to a charity.

58
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,250
聽著，我趕時間
Listen, I need to move on this,

59

我要去清理果園和小屋，那我先告辭了, Paul
We need to clear the orchard and the cottage. I can't wait around, Paul.

60
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,000
我約了律師週二見你

好，我一會兒順便就去
Well, I'll drop by and see him later.

62

你不能就這樣...

68
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,250
你當然有更重要的事
Well you obviously have more important things.

69
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,292
我們就再過17年見吧
I'll see you in another 17 years.

70
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:45,333
Andrew, 別這樣
Come on Andrew, don't be such an old

71
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:47,125
別怎樣？

00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,333
你才來了幾天, Paul？兩天？
How long have you been here, Paul? Two days?

73
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,958
你沒忘了當時你就是這樣一走了之的吧
Forget the fact that this all just leaves me and

74
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,042
媽死的時候
you're just like when mum died.

75
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:54,750
你他媽別提她, Andrew.
Oh leave mum the fuck out of it, Andrew.

76
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:56,833
對她尊重點
At least have the decency to do that.

77
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:57,875
尊重？
Decency?

78
00:07:58,042 --> 00:08:00,208
你以為你比我強？
You think you're the one being decent?

79
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:04,167
帶著一口英國腔站在這裡趾高氣昂
Swanning in here like some bloody film star with your accent?

80
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:07,250
你什麼都不知道, Andrew.

聽著，拿著這個

會議上他們給我的

葬禮那天你忘在了酒吧
You dropped it at the pub the afternoon of the service.

85
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:29,458
沒有它你可能回不了家了
It could be useful getting home.

86
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,000
你沒必要騙我, Paul
You didn't have to lie to me, Paul.

87
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,458
我們並沒有希望你會出現

94
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,542

潮水退去不再回歸

98

你們什麼時候能知道結果

109
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,625
你和我媽太像了

我找到了這個沒有人注意的地方，所以...
It's just a place that I found that no one else comes to, I just...

你是該走了

葬禮那天我在找你
I was looking for you at the service and I thought

我知道你會回來的，都認不出你了
I bet the little bugger is here somewhere. And I dont' even recognize him.

00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,667
到中東的不斷戰爭
to the ceaseless fighting in the Middle East

145
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:35,375
還有波斯尼亞衝突帶來的恐慌
and the horrors of the Bosnian conflict.

146
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:39,042
戰爭地區對你們將要見到的這個人來說
War zones have been both home and work

147
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:41,042
在過去十年成為了家園和工作地
for the last decade to the man you are about to meet.

148
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,958
他的勇氣和敬業
A man whose dedication and courage

149
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:46,333
為他贏得了崇高的國際榮譽
has gained him an international reputation of the highest merit.

150
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,250
更不用說
Not to mention

151
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,667
它的報導和攝影作品獲獎無數
the numerous awards he has received for both his articles and photographs,

152
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,417
他曾經是我的學生
and that he is an old dear student of mine

153
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:58,083
和你們一樣在這裡上過課
who I taught in these very buildings.

154
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,083
由請Paul Prior
I present to you Paul Prior.

155
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:13,875
謝謝
Thank you.

156
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:17,000
剛才的介紹實在不敢當, Seagar老師
That was a very generous introduction, Miss Seagar.

157
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:20,750
我學生時的成績可不怎麼樣
Yeah, my school reports were never that good.

158
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,333
事實上
The truth is that

159
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:28,875
有很多人對我惡言相向
I've been called many things,

160
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
離開這裡之後遭受過太多非議甚至辱罵
many worse things since I last stepped foot in this building

161
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,583
貪得無厭，寄生蟲，吸血鬼
vulture, parasite ,leech

162
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:45,250
不過我發現不同語言的侮辱，聽來是相似的
And it's amazing how insults in most languages sound pretty much the same.

163
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,875
我曾經
I was once

164
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:54,292
被囚禁三天，並當眾侮辱
held captive for three days and publicly urinated on.

165
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:58,542
我不知道該說什麼
I don't really know what to say,

166
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,125
但是很高興回答你們的問題
but I'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have.

167
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,875
他曾經獲得普利策獎的提名
He was a finalist for the Pulitzer

168
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,458
普利策？什麼鬼東西？
Pulitzer? What the hell is that?

169
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,708
是一個大獎
It's a huge prize.

170
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,917
他當時有三分之一的機會勝出
He had a one in three chance of winning it as well.

171
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,167
他在戰地攝影，寫戰爭報道

172
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,708
這些他都在行

173
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,333
你怎麼知道這些東西的
How do you know this shit?

174
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,583
我讀過一篇訪問
I read an interview.

175
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:09,917
聽著像個獨行俠
Sounds like a lone wolf.

176
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,792
對了，我想刺個紋身
That reminds me, I'm thinking of getting a tattoo.

177
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:17,042
在這裡紋個獨角獸
A little unicorn, right here.

178
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:19,667
為什麼？
Why?

179
00:23:19,792 --> 00:23:21,542
Steve也有一個？
Steve has exactly the same one?

180
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,625
我只是覺得會很酷
No I just think it would be cool.

181
00:23:28,042 --> 00:23:30,250
那麼
So anyway.

182
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:34,250
你和Jake怎麼樣了？
How'd it go with Jake?

183
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:36,042
走開！
Piss off.

184
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:37,083
告訴我
Tell me!

185
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:41,833
Well...

186
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,875
我們在灑滿月光的海邊漫步
first of all we had a moonlight stroll down the beach

187
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,417
享用了燭光晚餐
and a candle light dinner

188
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,333
然後他說我的眼睛很漂亮
and then he told me what beautiful eyes I had.

189
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:51,125
真的？
Really?

190
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:52,875
當然不是
No, you dyke.

191
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:56,500
他只知道喝酒
He only got drinks to go on the Big Day Out.

192
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:59,125
你知道他那樣子
You know he was like

193
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:02,375
"嘿，老兄！嘿，小妞！」
Yo man. Yo bitch.

194
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:07,417
他就是這樣
And I think it should be quite so obvious.

195
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,125
我剛看了這裡的報紙
I was reading the local rag today.

196
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,000
還是頭版
Front page.

197
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,083
天哪
Oh God.

198
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:26,333
我已經忘了這是個小地方了
I'd forgotten how quiet is, really.

199
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:30,833
來了這裡，我一直有該死的耳鳴
I've had this bloody ringing in my ears ever since I got here.

200
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,458
也許你應該改變一下
Maybe the change here will do you good.

201
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,167
如果你對做戰地記者已經感到厭倦
Like I said, if you ever get bored photographing war.

202
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,458
你不是說真的吧？
You weren't being serious, were you?

203
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,917
我手下有三個教員辭職了, Paul.
I'm three staff down, Paul.

204
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:51,833
我知道這你不太能接受，但...
I know it might sound desperate, but

205
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:55,167
Pat, 我不知道該怎麼做，我可從沒教過書
Pat, I'd be hopeless, I've never taught in my life. Come on.

206
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:58,625
你可以用你的方式，那沒問題吧？
You went out and made something of yourself. What can beat that?

207
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:03,583
這裡一半的孩子都不瞭解外面的世界
Half these kids don't even know what's on the other side of those hills.

208
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,208
Paul!
Paul!

209
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,458
Paul給Jonathan的
Paul gave Jonathan this.

210
00:25:48,292 --> 00:25:50,375
這相機變焦很好
It's got a good zoom lens.

211
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:55,583
這太貴重了
It's much, much too kind.

212
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,625
沒事的
No, it's fine.

213
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,542
我現在都用數碼的
Honestly, I'm using digital these days.

214
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:01,500
如果想成為好的攝影師，就要有好的相機
If you're going to be a serious photographer, you need a good zoom lens.

215
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:09,750
明天見
See you tomorrow then.

216
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,667
晚安，Paul
Goodnight. Paul.

217
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,000
晚安
Goodnight.

218
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,625
Jonathan說他在學校作了演講
Jonathan said he gave a talk at the school.

219
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,375
孩子們都喜歡他
Apparently the kids really liked him.

220
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:39,292
這很好
Good.

221
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:54,708
我可以做你了嗎？
Can I fuck you now?

222
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:56,583
天哪，你用詞太不注意了
God! You've got a way with words!

223
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:01,708
對不起，那你想做什麼？
Sorry, what do you want to do then?

224
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,292
你在幹嘛
What you all doing man?

225
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:09,750
玩玩
Just playing.

226
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,667
小心點
Just play carefully.

227
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:22,542
該死！去你的！
Shit! Fuck you!

228
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:27,167
你不該動的
You were meant to stay still.

229
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:00,958
你氣色不錯
You look well.

230
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:04,000
不如過去了
Well, used more like it.

231
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,417
你變了
It's different.

232
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:08,292
一口英國腔
You have an accent. So English.

233
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:09,333
你這麼覺得？
You think?

234
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,250
這也是難免的
Well, it was inevitable.

235
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,292
厭倦了被人叫做澳大利亞人
Sick of being called an Australian.

236
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:15,333
好吧
Fair enough.

237
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:17,792
來一根吧
Help yourself.

238
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,833
我戒了
Oh no, I quit.

239
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:23,042
有孩子嗎？
Kids?

240
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:25,125
兩個
Two.

241
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:26,833
一男一女
One of each.

242
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:28,875
記得Ben嗎？
Remember Ben?

243
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,333
Ben Steimer
Ben Steimer.

244
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:32,958
對
Yeah.

245
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36,708
你走後一年半我們在一起了
We got together about 18 months after you left.

246
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:39,708
女兒五歲的時候他死了
He died when Elvis was five.

247
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:41,292
摩托車禍
Motobike.

248
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:42,333
抱歉
I'm sorry.

249
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:48,042
那時我懷著Sam
I was pregnant with Sam at the time.

250
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:52,292
為了孩子，我決定開始工作
So I had the kids to think about and decided to keep the business running.

251
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:54,042
你做什麼？
What was that?

252
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,667
肉店
Butchery.

253
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,167
我是新西蘭個子最小的屠夫
Shortest butcher in New Zealand.

254
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,208
真的？
Really?

255
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:05,208
我是持剔骨刀的武士
Yeah well, I'm a ninja with a boning knife .

256
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:07,417
我不感到驚訝
No surprises there.

257
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:14,292
我經常看見你弟弟
I see your brother from time to time.

258
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:17,375
對，他一直很忙
Yeah, he's up to his neck in ostriches.

259
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:22,917
他沒離婚吧？我沒見過他妻子
Is he still married? I never see his wife.

260
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:26,333
沒有，她只是不常出門
No, yeah, I don't think she goes out much

261
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,042
我警告過你多少次了
How many times have I told you about leaving the gate to the pen open?

262
00:31:06,292 --> 00:31:08,875
如果你以為我會還給你，那就錯了
If you think you're going to see this again you're mistaken.

263
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:16,208
你讓我噁心
You disgust me.

264
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,417
你要去見誰
Who the hell is this guy?

265
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:24,167
一個老朋友，沒什麼
Just an old school friend. It's no big deal.

266
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,208
沒什麼？
No big deal?

267
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,208
我的外套呢？
Where's my jacket?

268
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:29,750
Celia, 別忘了垃圾
Celia, It's rubbish night.

269
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:32,625
把袋子繫上，別讓狗跑進去，再見
And please tie the bags. I don't want dogs getting into them. Bye, bye.

270
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:37,917
我們等著你
Hey, we'll be waiting.

271
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:44,083
要幫忙嗎？
Need a hand with that?

272
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,292
作業完成了？
Done your homework?

273
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:50,833
請把腳拿開
Will you please take your foot away?

274
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:54,125
我可是關心你
What? Just to see if you've done your homework.

275
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:57,000
問問而已
Just asking.

276
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:05,875
我們以前也這樣做過
I'm sure we used to be able to do this.

277
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:28,375
你會想到我嗎？
Did you think of me?

278
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:33,125
我怕見到你
I was terrified of seeing you.

279
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:52,333
記得你以前寫的那些詩和故事嗎？
You remember those poems and stories you used to write?

280
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,708
那時我想寫成歌，我們會出一張唱片
I was going to put music to them, release an album.

281
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:58,417
我們的樂隊叫什麼名字來著？
What were we were going to call ourselves?

282
00:33:00,917 --> 00:33:03,292
是"silly bastards"嗎？
What was it? Was it "silly bastards"?

283
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:05,250
"Stupid Buggers"
"Stupid Buggers"

284
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:12,958
"Sick Motherfuckers", "Sick Fuckers", 是嗎？
"Sick Motherfuckers", "Sick Fuckers", wasn't it?

285
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:17,208
是"Sick Puppy"
"Sick Puppy", actually.

286
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:22,542
還有演唱會
Live at the Hammersmith.

287
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:28,458
沒有如願以償，回過頭來看看曾經的自己
Yeah, see that's me. Eight years behind what was going on. But, you know,

288
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:33,042
現在還是會白日做夢
still thinking I had created it all for myself.

289
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:02,208
Celia

290
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,917
嗨
Hi.

291
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:33,292
我在採訪本地的名人
I've got an assignment where I have to interview an important local community member.

292
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:39,208
我在你和造灌溉渠的Aiken先生之間選擇了你
And it was a choice between you and Mr Aiken who set up the irrigation main.

293
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,083
你願意接受採訪嗎？
I was just wondering if I could interview you?

294
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:47,375
我可以進屋嗎？
Can I come in?

295
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,000
有真咖啡嗎？
Is there real coffee?

296
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:16,208
當然，要喝哪種
Sure. How do you have it?

297
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:19,458
Macchito, 謝謝
Macchito, thanks.

298
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:31,500
我叫Celia
I'm Celia by the way.

299
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:51,000
你有問題要問吧？
I gather you do have some questions.

300
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,750
嗯，對
Ah Yes. Ah Yeah.

301
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:58,000
你怎樣走上現在這條路的
So, how did you get to do what you do?

302
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,542
我在倫敦一家報社工作
I was working for a paper in London on local articles,

303
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:03,708
他們需要人手去波斯尼亞
and they needed somebody to go to Bosnia.

304
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:06,833
我知道，你在惠靈頓做過排字工人
That right, yeah. You were working as a typesetter in Wellington,

305
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,083
去倫敦學新聞
and you studied journalism in London,

306
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:11,917
後來成為專欄作家
and found your break as a feature article writer,

307
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,292
又稱為路透社的戰地記者
and then a field journalist for Reuters.

308
00:37:14,417 --> 00:37:17,417
過去的三年半你在往返於
And for the past three and a half years you've been solidly freelance living

309
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:19,917
倫敦、伊斯坦布爾、巴黎
between London, Istanbul and Paris.

310
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:22,000
說得不錯
Well done. Yes. That's it.

311
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,750
看來你下了點功夫
You've really done your homework.

312
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:29,792
人們一定為你做這樣的工作感到擔心
People must worry about you a lot doing this kind of work.

313
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,250
你的妻子？孩子？
Your wife? Children?

314
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,333
我未婚
No, not married.

315
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,125
單身？是
Single? Yes.

316
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:40,667
目睹戰爭的感受是怎樣的
What's it like going to war? Just to watch?

317
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:43,708
我不是去目睹，而是去記錄
I'm not there to watch. I'm there to record.

318
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:47,458
你的傷疤是因為戰爭留下的？
Is that how you got those scars?

319
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:54,292
12歲時騎車摔的
I fell off my bike when I was 12 coming down a gravel track.

320
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:56,833
沒有別的傷疤？
No other scars?

321
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:03,333
你還喝不喝你的macchito？
Are you going to drink your macchito?

322
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:14,875
你經歷過最困難的情況是？
What's the hardest thing you have to deal with?

323
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,375
上帝，你的問題真難回答
Jesus. Are these going to get any easier?

324
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:22,833
不知道，在那兒找廁所倒是相當困難
I don't know, finding a loo when you need one,which always seems to be pretty fucking impossible.

325
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:38,375
為什麼你不在聖誕節那天過生日？
Why don't you celebrate your birthday on Christmas?

326
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:43,333
這你又是在哪裡看到的
Now tell me, which article did you read that one in?

327
00:38:43,417 --> 00:38:46,250
你拍那女孩照片的那天是你的生日
It was your birthday when you took that photo of that girl.

328
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:47,667
那張作品獲得了普利策獎
The one you won the Pulitzer for.

329
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:49,750
提名
I was shortlisted.

330
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:52,917
我聽說你被提名後
I read that when you got nominated

331
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,208
自動退出
you withdrew the entry.

332
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,833
說來話長
Long story.

333
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:07,708
我的錄音帶有120分鐘
I've got a 120 minute tape.

334
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:20,000
我當時在Grozny
I was in Grozny

335
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:24,208
聽說俄國佬將要遭到一次攻擊
I heard about an offensive that was being mounted against the Russians.

336
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:27,750
朋友們警告我不要寫這篇報道
I was warned by some friends not to write about it

337
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:30,333
以防俄國人得知並發起反擊
in case the Russians caught whiff about what was going to happen.

338
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:31,208
你怎麼做的
So what did you do?

339
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,667
我還是寫了
Wrote the article.

340
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:36,125
發給路透社
Then I declined sending it through to Reuters.

341
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,125
他們還是發現了
They found out anyway.

342
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,083
為了報復，在城外的一個村莊殘殺了100多個平民
And they retaliated by massacring over 100 civilians in the village outside the city.

343
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,375
那晚我喝了一夜酒 其中幾個朋友幾小時後也被殺害了
.And I'd been out all night drinking with people who were killed a few hours later.

344
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,625
照片中的女孩
The girl in the photo was the

345
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:53,292
是唯一的倖存者
was the only survivor.

346
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:54,667
你認識她嗎？
Did you know her?

347
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:55,708
不
No.

348
00:39:57,917 --> 00:39:59,667
當時有別人在場嗎？
Was there anyone else around?

349
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,208
沒有別人
Not at the time, no.

350
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:02,375
只有你？
Just you?

351
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:03,625
只有我
Just me.

352
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:07,917
後來呢？
So then what?

353
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:14,292
我想你快沒電了
I think your batteries are running flat.

354
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:25,625
你是
Are you...

355
00:40:26,042 --> 00:40:28,333
你是Ben Steimer的女兒？
Are you Ben Steimer's daughter?

356
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:30,292
你知道他
Did you know him?

357
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:32,375
我們是同學
Yeah, we went to school together.

358
00:40:38,542 --> 00:40:39,708
一張孩子的照片
It's a photo of a baby.

359
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:40,750
誰的
Whose?

360
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:42,792
不知道，我需要嗎？
I don't know. Do I need to?

361
00:40:43,167 --> 00:40:44,333
看看那條手鏈
Yeah, look at the bracelet.

362
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:52,625
看著 "Celia, 27/2/87".
No, look! "Celia, 27/2/87".

363
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:55,542
那是我走後的八個月
That's roughly 8 months after I left.

364
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,333
我16年前就寄出這張照片了
I sent that photo nearly 16 years ago.

365
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:06,917
為什麼？
Why did you send it?

366
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,208
為什麼寄, Jax？
Why did you send it, Jax?

367
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:20,250
你想聽我的解釋？
You want an explanation?

368
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:26,667
你知道你徹底消失了嗎, Paul？
Do you know what's it like to be invisible, Paul?

369
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:30,375
一張明信片
Even just a postcard.

370
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:32,958
一個電話都沒有
A phone call.

371
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:38,583
Sid, 把它放那兒
Hi Sid, up there next to the porkers.

372
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:44,833
Patti Smith "Free Money"

373
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:56,042
都過去了，好嗎？
It's in the past. OK?

374
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:58,708
別管它
Just leave it.

375
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:14,417
你需要復件嗎？
Will you be needing a copy of that?

376
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:16,000
不，謝謝
No, thank you.

377
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,417
重新發行

378
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:20,083
上帝，我想我該從那群電視鬼中解脫一下
Oh my god. I think I need rescuing from these TV blokes.

379
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:22,917
是本好書吧？
Is it a good book, is it?

380
00:43:23,292 --> 00:43:26,083
"未知之雲", 好神秘
"The Cloud of Unknowing", Sounds mysterious.

381
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,875
你從哪兒來
Where are you from?

382
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:31,125
我從哪兒來
Where am I from?

383
00:43:32,417 --> 00:43:34,417
很遠的地方
A long way from here.

384
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:36,958
我也是，不介意我坐這兒吧？
Me too. Mind if I join you?

385
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:42,625
喝一杯？
Want a drink?

386
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:43,667
好
I'd love one.

387
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:08,333
吻我
Kiss me.

388
00:45:17,542 --> 00:45:18,833
是這本嗎？
Am I warm?

389
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,500
近了
Getting closer.

390
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:26,542
這本？
Warmer?

391
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:27,708
差不多了
Getting warmer.

392
00:45:27,917 --> 00:45:28,958
這本？
Warmer?

393
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:31,250
就快了
Warmer, in springtime.

394
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,292
這本!
Here!

395
00:45:57,542 --> 00:46:00,042
我們孤獨地來到這個世界
Alone we are born

396
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:02,167
孤獨地死去
And die alone

397
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:07,208
看那雪山之上的紅色微光
Yet see the red-gold cirrus Over snow mountain shine

398
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:10,417
在山路上前行
Upon the upland road

399
00:46:10,542 --> 00:46:12,750
陌生的你請放慢腳步
Ride easy, stranger

400
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:15,875
仰拜天空吧，憤怒的心
Surrender to the sky, your heart of anger

401
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:22,958
不要畏懼無限的可能性，兒子
Don't be frightened of possibilities, son.

402
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:25,583
她是偉大的象徵
She's a wonderful mistress.

403
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:10,375
沒事的
It's ok.

404
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:12,667
沒事的
It's ok.

405
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,208
沒事的
It's ok.

406
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:35,500
沒事的
It's ok.

407
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:51,458
睡吧
Go back to sleep.

408
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:21,292
我只是在這裡幫一陣子忙
I'm helping out for a couple of weeks.

409
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:23,917
我沒做過老師，請大家見諒
And I'm new at this, so be patient with me.

410
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,875
誰知道英語中有多少詞語
Who knows how many words there are in the English language?

411
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,958
一萬
10 thousand.

412
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:31,000
一萬
10 thousand.

413
00:48:33,875 --> 00:48:37,250
字典上有超過75萬
Dictionary. There's actually over 750,000 words.

414
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:40,792
我想讓你們每個人選一個詞語
And I was a -- I thought maybe you could all choose a word.

415
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:43,958
無論哪個詞，最好是對你們來說有一定意義的
Any word, doesn't matter what. Preferably something that means something to you.

416
00:48:44,042 --> 00:48:46,542
關於這個詞寫一些東西
And compose something on this word.

417
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,792
無論什麼都可以，可以是關於你們自己
Anything. It could be just a static image of you if you think that's easier.

418
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:54,750
這樣我可以認識你們
Just so I get an idea of who you all are.

419
00:48:54,917 --> 00:48:57,375
也看看現在自己處於什麼情況
And what the F--- I've gotten myself into.

420
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:10,292
希望
Hope.

421
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:13,458
她的思想是一座墳墓，她的心靈是一座島嶼
Her mind is a graveyard. Her heart is an island.

422
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:19,875
我們並非深交，但卻相識一生
She and I are not good friends but I've known her all my life.

423
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:27,625
她離我如此近，卻又那麼遠
She sits in my belly hollow and distant.

424
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:31,667
她的耳語從未撫慰我的心靈
And her whispered words of encouragement will never comfort me.

425
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,208
媽媽？
Mom?

426
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:47,083
我中了她的毒，她虛偽的承諾
I'm on to her tricks. Her false promises.

427
00:50:48,042 --> 00:50:51,583
"走開", 我說，"我今天很忙"" 有事要做"
"Go away", I tell her. "I'm busy today."" I've got things to do."

428
00:50:54,542 --> 00:50:57,417
她永遠不會離開
This acquaintance never knows when to leave.

429
00:50:58,667 --> 00:51:02,208
問題不是她為何成為了我的朋友
It's not a question of why she befriended me in the first place.

430
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:07,417
而是我為何沒有拒絕
It's more a question of why I choose to let her stay.

431
00:51:33,792 --> 00:51:37,000
茶袋!茶袋!
Tea bag! Tea bag!

432
00:51:37,292 --> 00:51:40,292
茶袋!
Tea bag!

433
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:46,167
茶袋!
Tea bag!

434
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:53,208
- 茶袋! - 放開她，你們這群畜牲!
- Tea bag! - Leave her alone, you fucking animal!

435
00:52:00,458 --> 00:52:03,250
茶袋!茶袋!
Tea bag! Tea bag!

436
00:53:45,042 --> 00:53:46,875
你的膝蓋破了
Your knee's bleeding.

437
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,833
我知道，我摔了一跤
I know. I fell.

438
00:53:58,792 --> 00:54:00,750
我來幫你看看
Come on. Let's take a look at it, then.

439
00:54:33,917 --> 00:54:35,333
幾周的時間過去
Weeks passed

440
00:54:35,417 --> 00:54:38,250
依然沒有大海的痕跡
and there was still no sign of the ocean.

441
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:42,583
人們更加擔心
The people grew worried.

442
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:46,875
他們決定派人去尋找
It was decided to send a small group to search for it

443
00:54:47,042 --> 00:54:49,500
滿心希望把它找回來
in the hope of bringing it back.

444
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:01,167
大家請注意
All right attention please.

445
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:04,083
請聽好
I would appreciate it if everyone listened.

446
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,750
包括你在內，Brook
That includes you, Mr Brook.

447
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:12,458
昨天以後你們見過Celia嗎？
Look. Have any of you seen Celia since yesterday?

448
00:55:18,458 --> 00:55:21,583
沒有？如果你們見到她
No? Well, if she gets in touch with any of you,

449
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:23,667
告訴我好嗎？
you know where to find me, okay?

450
00:55:23,917 --> 00:55:25,417
謝謝
Thanks.

451
00:55:27,667 --> 00:55:30,875
大家安靜，都不是沒見過警察
All right. Settle down. We've all seen a police officer before.

452
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,833
Paul，能和你聊兩句嗎？
Paul? Look, Just wondering. Can I have a word for a second?

453
00:55:44,292 --> 00:55:45,292
我上課要遲到了
I'm already late for a class.

454
00:55:45,417 --> 00:55:46,333
不會太長的
It won't take long.

455
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:49,375
回去上課
Back to class.

456
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,833
Paul？
Paul?

457
00:55:57,917 --> 00:56:00,625
Pat, 沒事的，我只是在幫點忙
Hey, Pat, It's fine. I'm just helping out with something.

458
00:56:00,708 --> 00:56:02,417
謝謝, Pat.
Thanks, Pat.

459
00:56:07,042 --> 00:56:09,667
週末你見過Celia嗎？
Hey, did you see Celia on the weekend?

460
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:12,208
沒有
No.

461
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:15,208
她來過你家吧？
She used to visit though, right.

462
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,125
對
Yeah.

463
00:56:22,167 --> 00:56:24,875
她會來借書
She came by sometimes to borrow books.

464
00:56:25,042 --> 00:56:27,292
她多久來一次
How often did she pop by?

465
00:56:32,042 --> 00:56:33,583
大多是週日吧
She liked to drop by most Sundays I guess, yeah.

466
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,000
- Liked？ - Likes.
Liked? Likes.

467
00:56:37,792 --> 00:56:39,917
我用的是現在時
I said likes, I think.

468
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,417
我想我知道Celia喜歡什麼
Ah see cause I think I know what Celia likes.

469
00:56:43,542 --> 00:56:46,667
她小的時候我就認識她了，她是我女兒最好的朋友
I mean I've known her since she was a little kid. She's my daughter's best friend.

470
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:52,042
我也知道你發郵件給她，讓她週末去找你
I also know that you sent her an e-mail on the weekend asking her to come by and visit.

471
00:56:52,667 --> 00:56:55,542
我瞭解到，那時她不太高興
She wasn't too happy about that from what I understand.

472
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:58,667
我知道這事兒, Paul
You see I know this, Paul

473
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,625
因為Miso答應她把她送到你家
because Miso agreed to drop her off.

474
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:04,500
她是去過我那兒
Actually she did drop by briefly.

475
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:11,750
你那果園不錯
It's nice out there at the orchard.

476
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:14,083
安靜，無人打擾
Quiet. Private.

477
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:20,917
你為什麼留下來？
So why did you stay on?

478
00:57:21,792 --> 00:57:23,917
幫一個朋友的忙
Favour for a friend.

479
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:28,083
你們戀愛了多久？
How long did you guys go out for?

480
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:29,417
什麼？
What?

481
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:29,917
你和媽媽
om

482
00:57:32,917 --> 00:57:34,000
她提到我了
Oh, she mentioned me.

483
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:35,542
你們什麼時候分手的？
When did you break up?

484
00:57:37,083 --> 00:57:39,958
十七歲
God, seventeen.

485
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:40,750
Keep your leg still.

486
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:41,833
不要動

487
00:57:49,167 --> 00:57:52,125
那天你寫的東西，我覺得
Listen, what you wrote the other day, I thought it was

488
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:56,750
考慮周到
well considered.

489
00:57:57,542 --> 00:58:00,208
- 考慮周到 - 引人入勝
Well considered. Intriguing.

490
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,833
我喜歡你佈置的書房
I like what you've done here.

491
00:58:14,833 --> 00:58:17,125
這些書是哪兒來的
Where did all these books come from?

492
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:19,917
他從沒告訴我
He never told me.

493
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:21,917
我想是保持神秘吧
Wanted to keep it a mystery, I suppose.

494
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:24,667
父親總是那樣的，不是嗎？
Father's have got a lot to answer for, huh?

495
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:51,458
嘿，美人
Hey beautiful.

496
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:55,000
對不起遲到了
Sorry I'm late.

497
00:59:15,792 --> 00:59:17,708
她不會走遠的
She can't have gone far.

498
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:28,708
我和幾個朋友一會兒要去Lawrence那兒
Me and some mates are going to take a look around Lawrence later.

499
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:32,458
你能端那兩個嗎？
Can you bring those?

500
00:59:34,417 --> 00:59:35,917
當然
Sure.

501
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:41,083
我要你寫的是有關移民的文章, Jake
I asked for an essay about the pros and cons of immigration, Jake

502
00:59:41,167 --> 00:59:43,333
不是衝浪的好去處
not the best places to surf.

503
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,083
Louise, Tonga的元首是國王，不是總統
Louise, Tonga has a king, not a president.

504
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:50,458
我想香港除了舞廳外還有更多值得關注的地方, Miso.
I think you'll find there's more to life in Hong Kong than dance clubs, Miso.

505
00:59:50,583 --> 00:59:53,417
比如說？秘密書會？
What? Like secret book clubs?

506
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:02,250
Paul!
Paul!

507
01:00:06,625 --> 01:00:08,583
O'Neil警官又來了
Sergeant O'Neil's back.

508
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:11,083
他還在上次的房間等你
He's waiting for you in the common room.

509
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:13,750
我告訴他你很忙
I told him you were busy.

510
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:23,375
你小時候寫的字不錯
You had nice handwriting as a kid.

511
01:00:26,208 --> 01:00:28,500
這是她借的書嗎？
Is this one of the books she borrowed?

512
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,833
我沒有
I didn't

513
01:00:32,958 --> 01:00:35,667
我沒有留下記錄
I didn't keep a record, to tell you the truth. I didn't.

514
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:38,333
什麼？你想著別的事吧
What? Other things on your mind, did you?

515
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:44,167
我們在路邊發現的，我想是你的東西
We found this on the side of the road, bet it came from your place.

516
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,917
我只是想知道它是怎麼到那兒的
Just want to know how it got there, that's all.

517
01:00:51,292 --> 01:00:53,583
她跟你提起過要出走嗎？
Did she ever talk to you about leaving?

518
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:57,292
這裡的年輕人都想離開
Name a teenager around here who doesn't.

519
01:00:57,917 --> 01:01:00,000
那可不一定
I know a few actually.

520
01:01:20,625 --> 01:01:23,167
Stop.

521
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:43,458
睜開眼睛
OK. You can open your eyes.

522
01:01:45,292 --> 01:01:47,208
生日快樂
Happy Birthday.

523
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:58,292
這是誰的歌
Who is this anyway?

524
01:01:58,667 --> 01:02:00,417
Kiri Te Kanawa，你選的
Kiri Te Kanawa. You chose it.

525
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:01,458
她是誰
Who's she?

526
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:03,208
你不知道？
Who's she?

527
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:07,292
你連她都不知道，很該死
There are people in this country who would shoot you for asking that question.

528
01:02:07,667 --> 01:02:10,833
你聽她的歌，才該死
There are people in this country who would shoot you for listening to it.

529
01:02:16,417 --> 01:02:18,583
她在唱什麼？
So what's she singing about?

530
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,042
愛情
Love.

531
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:29,083
週六晚上你一般幹些什麼？
What do you normally do on a Saturday night?

532
01:02:29,167 --> 01:02:32,167
不和我野餐的話，你會和誰一起
Who do you hang out with when you're not having picnics with me?

533
01:02:32,292 --> 01:02:33,750
你會做什麼，參加聚會還是？
What do you do, go to parties or what?

534
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:35,500
如果你稱其為聚會的話
If you can call them that.

535
01:02:35,583 --> 01:02:39,417
問這個幹嘛？你想加入？你可能會看到他們玩茶袋
Why? Do you wanna come along? You actually might get to see them tea bagging.

536
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:41,625
茶袋？那是什麼？
Tea bagging? What's that?

537
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:46,458
那個，是一群男孩把女孩灌醉
Well, That's when guys get a girl completely comatose

538
01:02:46,583 --> 01:02:51,583
他們把那個伸進她的眼窩，然後拍下來
and then they take turns in lowering their testicles into her eye sockets and film it.

539
01:02:52,417 --> 01:02:55,125
如果他們覺得有意思 會把照片寄給一個瘋狂的朋友
And if they're really kind they send a copy to a paranoid friend.

540
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:59,583
射了的最好，我不覺得那很有趣
First class is seminal? It's not funny.

541
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:04,292
我不知道我們在說什麼
I don't know what we're talking about.

542
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:05,333
上帝
Oh god.

543
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:13,375
我希望你離那些男孩遠些
Well I hope you keep your distance from those kind of guys is what I'm saying.

544
01:03:17,458 --> 01:03:20,208
說說你和我媽吧，回到黑暗時代
So, tell me about you and mum, back in the dark ages.

545
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:22,625
沒有你說的那麼誇張
It wasn't that long ago.

546
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:32,000
Patti Smith "Horses"

I'll show you something.

551
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
這是什麼地方？
Where did this place come from?

552
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:15,667
只有我和我爸知道
No one knows about it except me and my dad.

553
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:18,208
你們在這裡幹什麼？

01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:42,583
給你找些素材，呆子

561
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:51,542
不敢相信她也有過夢想
It's hard to believe she even had a dream.

562
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,792
你想知道我的夢想是什麼嗎？
Do you want to know what my dream is?

563
01:05:57,167 --> 01:05:57,833
想啊
Yeah.

564
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,375
我坐在西班牙的一間咖啡館
I'm sitting in a cafe in Spain.

565
01:06:08,042 --> 01:06:12,542
不認識一個人，不懂一句話
And don't know a single person there. And I can't understand a single word that anyone's saying.

566
01:06:14,667 --> 01:06:16,875
我握著一杯酒
I've got a glass of wine

567
01:06:18,792 --> 01:06:20,917
看見海
and I can see the sea.

568
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:28,542
算了，還是不說了
Don't worry.

569
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,208
繼續啊，然後？
No, go on. And?

570
01:06:34,583 --> 01:06:36,375
我只是寫作
I'm just writing.

571
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:40,708
然後
And yeah.

572
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:46,667
我不介意有沒有人看我的作品
And you know it doesn't matter if no one ever reads what I'm writing

573
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:49,875
我不想成名
I don't want to be famous.

574
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:52,625
我只是，只是想在那兒
I just, I just want to be there.

575
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:04,625
寧可寂寂無名，也不願迷失所在
Anyway, I'd rather be a no one somewhere than someone nowhere.

576
01:07:06,917 --> 01:07:09,083
我已經整理好了行李
I've already packed my suitcase.

577
01:07:10,542 --> 01:07:11,750
我沒有開玩笑
I'm not joking.

578
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:13,417
我沒有嘲笑你
I'm not laughing at you.

579
01:07:15,375 --> 01:07:17,958
我也有過這樣的夢
I had a similar dream once.

580
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:19,792
真的嗎？
Really?

581
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:22,917
告訴我
Tell me.

582
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:31,250
有時我能看見...人們的臉
Sometimes I'd see...faces.

583
01:07:34,875 --> 01:07:38,542
入睡之前，陌生的人
At night before I fell asleep, people I never met.

584
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,708
我不知道他們是誰
And I'd wonder who they were.

585
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:47,000
他們身在何處，他們所事何物
Where they might live, what they did.

586
01:07:48,334 --> 01:07:49,917
奇怪的是
and it was strange

587
01:07:50,209 --> 01:07:53,375
好像他們知道我在想著他們
because it was like they knew I was thinking about them.

588
01:07:55,792 --> 01:07:58,459
你為什麼要做戰地記者？
Why did you become a war journalist?

589
01:08:01,542 --> 01:08:04,667
你往往無法成為嚮往的自己
Who you set out to be is not always who you become.

590
01:08:04,792 --> 01:08:07,375
事情發生了，計劃改變了
You know, Things happen. Plans change.

591
01:08:13,417 --> 01:08:15,292
我也會看見他們
I see them too.

592
01:08:17,042 --> 01:08:18,917
人臉
Faces.

593
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:25,334
我想給你個東西
I wanted to give you something.

594
01:08:33,875 --> 01:08:36,209
Yeah, right.

595
01:08:36,542 --> 01:08:38,959
我想你應該參加
I just, I think you should enter.

596
01:08:39,667 --> 01:08:42,084
寫作比賽

597
01:09:13,334 --> 01:09:15,542
你從來沒有說起過你的母親
You never talk about your mum.

598
01:09:15,709 --> 01:09:17,500
我的母親？她是虔誠的教徒
My mum? She's very religious.

599
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:21,250
她告訴我上帝在安靜的角落藏了美好
She had these little sermons about the beauty God hides away in quiet corners.

600
01:09:21,584 --> 01:09:24,250
你爸爸在這裡就是為了躲避這些吧
Is that what your dad was hiding from in here?

601
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:26,500
不，他們
No, they

602
01:09:26,959 --> 01:09:29,459
她只是很安靜
I think she was just quiet, you know.

603
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:32,709
我父母很不同
My dad and her were very different.

604
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:35,500
我爸不相信任何事，他是無神論者
My dad didn't believe in anything. He's an atheist.

605
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:38,000
我弟弟和她很親近
My brother and her were very close.

606
01:09:39,209 --> 01:09:41,584
我聽說她發生了意外
I heard she had an accident .

607
01:09:42,542 --> 01:09:44,334
是的
Yeah she did.

608
01:09:44,875 --> 01:09:48,084
她被診斷得了抑鬱癥
She was diagnosed as bi-polar, manic depression.

609
01:09:49,209 --> 01:09:52,750
她沒有服醫生給的藥
Doctors prescribed lithium but she stopped taking it, I think.

610
01:09:53,834 --> 01:09:55,792
發生了什麼？
What happened?

611
01:09:59,417 --> 01:10:01,792
她站在河裡
She was standing in the river

612
01:10:03,417 --> 01:10:06,709
在農場的後邊，她的手指向了空中的鷹
at the back of the property and she pointed up to this hawk in the sky.

613
01:10:06,875 --> 01:10:09,250
我再次望向她時。她已經不在了
And then when I looked back she was gone.

614
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:11,917
兩天後找到了屍體
Found the body two days later, I think

615
01:10:17,542 --> 01:10:20,084
這是你疏遠人事的原因嗎？
Is that why you push people away?

616
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,542
我想做什麼就做什麼，Celia. 我討厭打碎你的幻想
I do as I fucking please Celia. You know I hate to spoil your illusions.

617
01:10:31,292 --> 01:10:34,209
但是外面的世界不是等待採摘的玫瑰
But the world out there isn't a bed of roses waiting to be picked

618
01:10:35,125 --> 01:10:38,500
或者像你說的，一個酒吧裡的一杯好酒
or whatever it was you said, a glass of chardonnay in a fucking tapas bar.

619
01:10:39,917 --> 01:10:40,750
你懂嗎？
You understand?

620
01:10:40,959 --> 01:10:42,625
我沒有想過要冒犯你
It wasn't an insult.

621
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:50,584
對不起
Sorry.

622
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:56,667
沒事
OK.

623
01:11:09,834 --> 01:11:11,542
嘿, Jax.
Hey, Jax.

624
01:11:12,459 --> 01:11:13,917
嗨
Hi

625
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,584
我看到你這兒有煙，其實不想打擾你
I saw the smoke and I didn't want to disturb you

626
01:11:16,834 --> 01:11:18,667
但是今天是你的生日，所以
but I remembered it was your birthday and so I

627
01:11:33,667 --> 01:11:35,375
到車裡去
Get in the car

628
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:37,625
不
No.

629
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:39,167
Celia, 我受夠了
Celia, I'm sick of this.

630
01:11:39,292 --> 01:11:42,334
我說到車裡去，到車裡去
I said get in the car. I said get in the car

631
01:11:44,875 --> 01:11:47,417
你沒有權利來這裡趕我走，晚安，Paul
You have no right to be here. Night, Paul.

632
01:11:55,625 --> 01:11:58,542
你把她帶來這裡，還給她酒？
You have the audacity to bring here and give her alcohol?

633
01:11:58,625 --> 01:12:01,209
Jax, 不是你想的那樣
Jax, it's not what you think.

634
01:12:05,959 --> 01:12:08,667
你以為你連我怎麼想的都知道？
You even presume to know what I think?

635
01:12:22,959 --> 01:12:24,417
該死
Shit!

636
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:26,959
對不起
Excuse me.

637
01:12:28,292 --> 01:12:32,459
我要找一本筆記，應該在這裡
I need a notebook. I know it's here somewhere.

638
01:12:35,917 --> 01:12:36,542
對不起，爸爸
Sorry, dad.

639
01:12:36,959 --> 01:12:38,625
不用道歉
There's nothing to be sorry for

640
01:12:39,292 --> 01:12:41,292
只要你們注意著點就好
as long as you're being cautious.

641
01:12:41,375 --> 01:12:43,000
當然
Yeah of course.

642
01:12:44,834 --> 01:12:46,500
那我走了
I'll be on my way.

643
01:12:54,209 --> 01:12:56,084
你不該來這兒的
You shouldn't be here.

644
01:12:57,167 --> 01:12:59,084
他不在乎的
He doesn't care.

645
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:01,375
你也看到了
I mean you saw for yourself.

646
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:02,584
我在乎
I care.

647
01:13:02,792 --> 01:13:04,167
你什麼意思？
What are you telling me?

648
01:13:04,292 --> 01:13:07,417
你是說我不如你的想法重要？
That I'm not as important as what goes on in your head?

649
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:11,000
我的一部分是你無法擁有的
There's just parts of me you can't have.

650
01:13:12,542 --> 01:13:14,209
沒有人可以
No one can.

651
01:13:23,042 --> 01:13:25,125
嘿，你好嗎？
Hey. You ok?

652
01:13:28,834 --> 01:13:31,292
現在別給我這個
I'd rather look at it at your place.

653
01:13:36,459 --> 01:13:38,500
這是什麼？
What's this?

654
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:44,125
上帝
Jesus Christ.

655
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:46,625
她打的嗎？
Did she do this?

656
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:49,167
Celia，告訴我，誰打的
Celia tell me, who did it?

657
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:53,125
我不想說，不是我媽
I don't want to talk about it. It wasn't mom.

658
01:13:58,084 --> 01:13:58,959
嘿，他在哪兒
Hey where is he?

659
01:13:59,125 --> 01:14:00,292
Paul, 你幹嘛
Paul, what are you doing?

660
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,709
Paul, 你在我家幹嘛
Paul, what are you doing in my house?

661
01:14:02,042 --> 01:14:03,042
他在哪兒, Jackie？
Where is he, Jackie?

662
01:14:03,209 --> 01:14:03,667
怎麼了
What's going on?

663
01:14:03,834 --> 01:14:04,709
就是這個混蛋嗎？
Is this the asshole?

664
01:14:04,917 --> 01:14:05,917
什麼？這他媽是誰？
What? Who the fuck is this?

665
01:14:05,959 --> 01:14:07,375
他媽閉嘴, Gareth!
Shut the fuck up, Gareth!

666
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,459
Paul, 出去
Paul, would you leave?

667
01:14:08,542 --> 01:14:09,084
這就是傳說中的Paul啊
So this is the famous Paul.

668
01:14:11,292 --> 01:14:14,417
你喜歡打小女孩是吧，你知道這是虐待？
You like beating up little girls, do you. You know it's assault, is what it is.

669
01:14:14,625 --> 01:14:16,167
你再敢碰她，我殺了你
You touch her again. I'll kill you.

670
01:14:16,709 --> 01:14:18,250
殺了我，啊？
Is that right, mate?

671
01:14:18,334 --> 01:14:20,959
給我看清楚了，白癡
What do you call this, dickhead?

672
01:14:21,042 --> 01:14:22,459
我只管好我自己的事
I always mind my own fucking business.

673
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:29,000
滾出我家，蠢人
Get out of my house, you fucking pricks.

674
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,292
管好你自己的事
Mind your fucking business.

675
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:41,459
你給我滾，清楚了嗎？
You cunt, you fuck off! Is that clear?

676
01:14:42,584 --> 01:14:44,042
還想殺我嗎，蠢人
Still wanna fucking kill me, cunt?

677
01:14:44,125 --> 01:14:45,042
Gareth, 你他媽進去
Gareth, Get the fuck inside.

678
01:14:46,167 --> 01:14:47,042
進去！
Get the fuck inside!

679
01:14:50,167 --> 01:14:53,542
你以為你可以闖進我家 在我孩子面前做出這樣的事？
You think you can come here and do this shit in front of my kids?

680
01:14:53,959 --> 01:14:56,084
你看到她的傷嗎？你以為我還能做什麼？
Have you seen her fucking bruises? What did you think I was going to do?

681
01:14:56,167 --> 01:14:58,792
她要忍受的還有更多，我要你離她遠點
She got a lot more than she got. I want you to stay away from her.

682
01:14:59,334 --> 01:15:01,667
你改了出生證明
You changed the birth certificate.

683
01:15:02,084 --> 01:15:04,125
你準備什麼時候告訴她？
When were you going to tell her about that?

684
01:15:07,917 --> 01:15:10,375
不要再來煩我們，行嗎？
Just stay out of our lives, all right?

685
01:15:13,584 --> 01:15:15,292
好啊
Yeah.

686
01:15:15,417 --> 01:15:18,042
回頭見，Paul，該死的蠢人
See you around Paul, you fucking prick.

687
01:15:25,334 --> 01:15:26,750
喂？
Hello?

688
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,542
喂？
Hello?

689
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:31,334
喂？
Hello?

690
01:15:32,792 --> 01:15:34,542
Celia？
Celia?

691
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,792
她可能去了西班牙
She might have gone to Spain.

692
01:15:54,084 --> 01:15:55,542
不不不，等等
No, no, no, wait.

693
01:15:55,667 --> 01:15:58,417
我女兒秘密計劃去西班牙，他為她保密
My daughter plans on running off to Spain and he sees nothing.

694
01:15:58,500 --> 01:15:59,792
我不認為那很正常
I don't call that irrelevant.

695
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,292
Jackie, 這也不是她第一次這樣做了
Come on Jackie, it's not like it's the first time she's done something like this.

696
01:16:02,375 --> 01:16:03,875
太好了
Oh great.

697
01:16:04,542 --> 01:16:07,209
好啊，你幫著他說話了？
How good, this is good. So you are defending him now?

698
01:16:08,792 --> 01:16:11,625
那好，她具體是什麼時候說要去西班牙的？
Okay, so when exactly did she say she was running off to Spain?

699
01:16:11,709 --> 01:16:14,667
她沒有，沒有說出來，我知道她有機票
She didn't. She didn't say. All I knew is she had the ticket.

700
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:17,250
我以為她會等學校放假再走，就是這樣
I thought she was going to leave when school was finished. That's all.

701
01:16:17,334 --> 01:16:19,167
我不知道該怎麼想
I didn't know what to think.

702
01:16:19,292 --> 01:16:22,042
我知道我是怎麼想的，我想你瘋了
Yeah well I know what I think. I think you are out of your mind.

703
01:16:22,459 --> 01:16:25,125
她讓我保證不告訴任何人
She made me promise not to tell a soul.

704
01:16:25,917 --> 01:16:27,625
我是她的媽媽
I'm her mother.

705
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,375
OK？
OK?

706
01:16:29,917 --> 01:16:32,500
那她是什麼時候這樣做的呢？
When exactly did she make this promise Paul?

707
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:34,417
是你給她灌酒喝的時候嗎？
Was it when you were plying her with alcohol?

708
01:16:34,542 --> 01:16:36,959
我沒有灌她，我只是給了她一杯，孩子能喝的
I wasn't plying her with alcohol. I gave her a glass, Jackie. A child could have drunk it.

709
01:16:37,042 --> 01:16:37,875
孩子是喝了
A child did drink it.

710
01:16:39,542 --> 01:16:41,459
是啊，那他打她的時候她也是那樣想的嗎？
Oh yeah. And did he think of that when he was punching the shit out of her?

711
01:16:41,834 --> 01:16:42,500
還有別的
And the rest.

712
01:16:42,625 --> 01:16:44,292
滾開，別把我扯進去
Fuck off. Don't bring me into it.

713
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:45,042
偷看她
Sneaking up on her.

714
01:16:45,209 --> 01:16:47,125
趁她洗澡時故意去廁所
Pissing in the toilet while she was lying in the bath.

715
01:16:47,209 --> 01:16:50,500
她跑得遠遠的就是為了躲著你，你他媽的...
If it took her going half way around the world to get away from you, you fucking a--.

716
01:16:53,834 --> 01:16:54,667
你們留下
You two stay in here.

717
01:16:54,875 --> 01:16:56,875
你去我辦公室，我和你單獨談
You, get in my office. I want a word alone.

718
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,042
他在說什麼？
What's he talking about?

719
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:03,875
他他媽說的是什麼？
What the fuck is he talking about

720
01:17:04,167 --> 01:17:04,959
沒什麼!
Nothing!

721
01:17:08,959 --> 01:17:11,750
告訴我你最後一次見她的情況，不要隱瞞
Tell me about the last time you saw her. Everything.

722
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:13,792
我把她送到門口，她拿著地圖
We were at the gate. She was carrying the atlas.

723
01:17:13,959 --> 01:17:15,125
她告了別，然後離開
She said goodbye and she left.

724
01:17:15,209 --> 01:17:16,167
沒有特殊的告別？
No special goodbyes?

725
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:17,209
沒有特殊的告別
No special goodbyes.

726
01:17:17,292 --> 01:17:19,209
她有幾本書沒來得及讀
No, she had a couple of books she hadn't got around to read

727
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:20,542
我告訴她可以留著
and I told her she could keep them.

728
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:21,625
這些書的名字？
Names of these books?

729
01:17:21,667 --> 01:17:23,167
這有關嗎，我不知道
Oh fuck say, what does it matter? I don't know.

730
01:17:25,334 --> 01:17:27,875
Janet Frame的"Owls Do Cry", 還有一本
"Owls Do Cry", by Janet Frame, and another one,

731
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,084
Camus的"The Outsider", 應該是這本
Camus, "The Outsider", I think it was.

732
01:17:31,667 --> 01:17:34,667
是Camus，不是canoe. C-a-m-u-s
That's Camus not canoe. C-a-m-u-s.

733
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,125
自以為是的傢伙
You smug prick.

734
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:41,042
不是每個人都想去歐洲的
Not all of us had to run off to Europe, mate.

735
01:18:16,417 --> 01:18:18,167
旅行日記
Travel Diary

736
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,334
護照
passport

737
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,375
"失蹤的女孩和老師共處一密室"
"Missing girl, teacher, shared secret den"

738
01:18:42,584 --> 01:18:44,042
我想你已經看過了
I guess you've seen this.

739
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:49,084
小鎮的閒言碎語
Small town bloody gossip.

740
01:18:51,584 --> 01:18:53,959
我不知道怎樣處理, Paul.
I don't know what to do about this, Paul.

741
01:18:55,584 --> 01:18:58,125
學校高層開了會
The board of trustees have called a meeting.

742
01:19:00,959 --> 01:19:03,875
我知道你是無辜的
You don't deserve this.

743
01:19:04,084 --> 01:19:04,917
沒事的, Pat.
You know it's fine, Pat.

744
01:19:05,209 --> 01:19:07,875
我也該走了，說真的
It's time I left anyway. Honestly.

745
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:12,000
嘿，Jonathan.
Hey! Jonathan.

746
01:19:12,209 --> 01:19:13,875
Jonathan？
Jonathan?

747
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:29,542
Jonathan!
Jonathan!

748
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,709
Jonathan!
Jonathan!

749
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:34,334
上車
Get in!

750
01:19:35,417 --> 01:19:37,959
Jonathan, 上車，外面太冷了
Jonathan, get in the car, it's bloody freezing.

751
01:19:39,167 --> 01:19:40,750
快
Come on.

752
01:19:41,625 --> 01:19:43,334
繫上安全帶
Put your seat belt on.

753
01:19:48,459 --> 01:19:50,625
你和她發生關繫了嗎？
Were you having sex with her?

754
01:19:51,334 --> 01:19:53,000
什麼？
What?

755
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:57,834
你知道我說的是誰
You know who.

756
01:20:00,834 --> 01:20:02,584
誰說的
Who said that?

757
01:20:03,417 --> 01:20:05,250
誰說的
Who said that?

758
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:12,792
學校裡的孩子，說你在床上給她特殊訓練
Kids at school, said you were giving her special coaching in bed.

759
01:20:19,834 --> 01:20:21,667
你相信他們？
And you believed them?

760
01:20:26,292 --> 01:20:27,959
你相信了
Huh, and you believed

761
01:20:36,834 --> 01:20:39,917
照相機呢？最近沒有看見你用它
How's that camera going? I haven't seen you with it lately.

762
01:21:07,709 --> 01:21:11,042
日復一日，越來越多的人開始尋找
As the days went on, more and more people went looking.

763
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,834
人們四處尋找
The people searched far and wide

764
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,584
但是大海消失得毫無蹤影
but the ocean had vanished without a trace.

765
01:21:31,459 --> 01:21:34,125
曾經富饒的大地
The quiet land once bountiful

766
01:21:34,292 --> 01:21:36,584
變得堅硬和貧瘠
had become hard and unyielding.

767
01:21:47,334 --> 01:21:49,792
地平線上的某物現了形
Then a shape appeared on the horizon.

768
01:21:51,834 --> 01:21:54,250
透過恨意的強光，人們看到
Through a blaze of hate the people saw

769
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:57,500
翻滾的海水向他們襲去
what looked like tumbling water rolling towards them.

770
01:21:59,709 --> 01:22:01,625
激烈之浪灌過小鎮
A wave of excitement passed through the town

771
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:05,042
當他們焦急地盼著大海回歸
as they anxiously watched the ocean return.

772
01:22:05,959 --> 01:22:08,167
當它逼近的時候，一切突變
But as it grew closer the shape began to alter and mutate.

773
01:22:11,625 --> 01:22:15,792
翻滾的海水其實是大群野馬
What looked like tumbling water was in fact wild horses.

774
01:22:17,959 --> 01:22:21,750
人們眼看馬群四處逼近
Everywhere they turned they saw horses drawing closer and closer.

775
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:25,167
他們的興奮轉為了恐懼
Their excitement turned to fear.

776
01:22:26,292 --> 01:22:28,292
他們的恐懼成為了恐慌
And their fear became panic,

777
01:22:30,959 --> 01:22:33,834
眼見馬群的前進無可阻擋
for it seemed that nothing could stop their advance.

778
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,709
就如大海的消失
Which as the ocean's disappearance

779
01:22:39,209 --> 01:22:41,292
來得毫無徵兆
had come without warning.

780
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,709
但是沒有人
But then no one,

781
01:22:46,834 --> 01:22:48,792
甚至沒有一刻時間
not even for a moment,

782
01:22:48,959 --> 01:22:52,709
能夠質疑為何，大海在最初離開
had stopped to question why the ocean had left in the first place.

783
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:11,084
Prior先生？
Mr. Prior?

784
01:23:11,459 --> 01:23:14,584
我是惠靈頓警局的Farno探員
I am Detective Inspector Farnon from Wellington CIV.

785
01:23:14,667 --> 01:23:16,667
這是Dunleavy探員
This is Detective Dunleavy.

786
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:18,584
我有搜查令
I've a warrant to search these premises.

787
01:23:18,667 --> 01:23:21,792
需要你去警局回答一些問題
And I'll need you to accompany me to the station for questioning.

788
01:23:23,792 --> 01:23:26,709
我需要你的護照和車鑰匙
I'll need your passport and keys to your car.

789
01:23:29,209 --> 01:23:32,750
我知道Celia常去一個密室和你見面
I believe there's a shed where Celia used to visit you.

790
01:23:42,167 --> 01:23:44,250
好，我們送你回去
Right then, let's get you home.

791
01:24:04,209 --> 01:24:07,167
上週日Celia為什麼去你家？
Why did Celia come to your place last Sunday?

792
01:24:10,459 --> 01:24:11,667
你聽見我的問題了嗎？
Did you hear the question?

793
01:24:12,125 --> 01:24:12,709
聽見了
Yes.

794
01:24:13,667 --> 01:24:16,542
我知道她定期來見你
I understand she visited you regularly.

795
01:24:17,292 --> 01:24:19,584
她來得目的是什麼？
What was the nature of the visits?

796
01:24:19,792 --> 01:24:21,125
我們談一些事
We talked about things.

797
01:24:21,375 --> 01:24:22,167
什麼事？
What things?

798
01:24:22,292 --> 01:24:23,875
歐洲
Europe.

799
01:24:24,167 --> 01:24:26,000
書
Books.

800
01:24:27,709 --> 01:24:30,000
Celia想成為作家
Celia wants to be a writer.

801
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:43,792
我不是肉，我不是血
I am not flesh. I am not blood.

802
01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:46,750
他們可以盡其所能，但是他們看不見我
They can look all they like but they'll never see me.

803
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:50,417
如果這一生我無法再聽見你的愛，握你的手
If I never hear your love or hold your hand again in this life,

804
01:24:50,542 --> 01:24:53,292
向我保證死後我們會再見
promise me we will touch when I am dead.

805
01:24:55,417 --> 01:24:58,167
詩的名字是'Poem for a Lonely Friend'
It's called 'Poem for a Lonely Friend'.

806
01:24:59,459 --> 01:25:02,209
你覺得自己孤獨嗎, Paul？
Would you consider yourself lonely, Paul?

807
01:25:11,375 --> 01:25:13,042
謝謝
Thank you.

808
01:25:13,959 --> 01:25:16,542
請關上門
Would you keep that door closed, please.

809
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,167
為什麼Celia堅持來看你，不顧她父母的反對？
Why did Celia keep visiting you even though her parents had forbidden it?

810
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:26,125
父母？
Parents?

811
01:25:26,292 --> 01:25:27,167
母親
Mother.

812
01:25:27,709 --> 01:25:30,125
我想她從我身上看到了一些東西
I guess she saw something in me.

813
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:32,917
什麼東西？
And what was that?

814
01:25:33,209 --> 01:25:35,125
我不是Celia.
Well, I'm not Celia.

815
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:38,375
那也許你可以告訴我們，你從她身上看到了什麼
Then perhaps you'd like to tell me what it was you saw in her?

816
01:25:41,334 --> 01:25:43,584
我知道這很困難
I know this is diffi--

817
01:25:46,959 --> 01:25:49,042
我記得成為她的感覺
I remember being her.

818
01:26:07,375 --> 01:26:09,000
這次你又做了什麼？
What did you do this time?

819
01:26:09,459 --> 01:26:10,667
讓我一個人呆著
Come on, leave me alone now .

820
01:26:10,792 --> 01:26:12,375
走開
Go away.

821
01:26:13,459 --> 01:26:15,709
走吧你，走吧，讓我一個人呆著
Just fucking go, come on, leave me alone.

822
01:26:15,834 --> 01:26:17,875
我不需要你, Celia，走開
I don't need this shit, Celia.Just go.

823
01:26:18,209 --> 01:26:18,917
怎麼了
What?

824
01:26:20,084 --> 01:26:21,167
我媽跟你說了什麼了嗎？
Did mom say something to you?

825
01:26:21,459 --> 01:26:23,250
你媽威脅說要告訴學校
Your mum threatened to ring the school, yeah.

826
01:26:23,334 --> 01:26:24,167
可以了嗎？
Okay?

827
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:25,625
不，不可以
No, it's not ok.

828
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:29,084
她太他媽不講理了
God, she's so fucking presumptuous.

829
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,959
誰他媽在乎她怎麼想的
Who the fuck cares what she thinks?

830
01:26:33,125 --> 01:26:36,000
她那個討厭的男友穿著像船那麼大的鞋子
She's got a fucking boyfriend he wears boat shoes.

831
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:38,875
他也給她買了一雙，現在他們一個鼻子出氣了
He brought her a pair now they're both wearing them.

832
01:26:39,292 --> 01:26:41,959
在這兒他媽一隻船都看不到
You never see a fucking boat around here.

833
01:26:48,042 --> 01:26:50,209
我來是要告訴你我參加那個比賽了
I just came to tell you that I entered the contest .

834
01:26:50,417 --> 01:26:52,042
那很好，加油吧
Well that's great, now get going.

835
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,125
我們不是不可以做朋友, Paul.
It's not illegal that we're friends or something, Paul.

836
01:26:58,459 --> 01:27:01,917
是你說的，我們不該在意別人的想法
It was you who said that we shouldn't care what other people think of us.

837
01:27:09,667 --> 01:27:11,625
難道你只是說說而已
Or were you just saying that?

838
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:56,500
你和我媽曾是戀人，現在我們是朋友
You know how you and mom used to go out and now it me and you that are friends.

839
01:28:00,084 --> 01:28:02,750
我感覺我這一生都有你這個朋友
I feel like I've known you my whole life.

840
01:28:02,917 --> 01:28:05,209
是啊，這個世界很小
Yeah well, it's a small world.

841
01:28:05,334 --> 01:28:07,584
世界並不小
It isn't a small world.

842
01:28:10,917 --> 01:28:12,834
你們當時相愛嗎？
Were you guys in love?

843
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:20,959
你們把對方的名字紋在腳趾上，一定不只是兒戲
There must've been something going on if you tattooed each others feet.

844
01:28:24,375 --> 01:28:26,375
有些難以想像你在她身上看到了什麼
It's a little hard to imagine what you saw in her.

845
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:29,584
你不是唯一一個對父母抱有這樣想法的人
Well, you're not the first person to feel that way about their parents.

846
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:33,167
算了，都是很久以前的事了
Anyway, it's a long time ago.

847
01:28:36,209 --> 01:28:38,334
也許就是那樣
I know it wasn't planned.

848
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:41,459
媽那時才16歲
Mom was only 16.

849
01:28:48,834 --> 01:28:51,500
如果你心裡有什麼事，會告訴我的吧
You'd tell me if you knew anything, eh?

850
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,125
保證嗎？
Is that a promise?

851
01:29:07,709 --> 01:29:09,209
行了
Oh stuff it.

852
01:29:09,459 --> 01:29:12,167
淋雨去吧，走
Let's get wet. Come on.

853
01:29:13,625 --> 01:29:18,417
Mazzy Star "Take Everything"
Mazzy Star "Take Everything"

854
01:29:56,084 --> 01:29:56,834
天啊
Oh, geez!

855
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:58,917
Andrew, Jonathan？
Andrew, Jonathan?

856
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,542
我們從教堂回家，想進來坐坐
We were on our way home from church and thought we'd stop in for a cuppa.

857
01:30:03,084 --> 01:30:04,667
該死
Fuck.

858
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:07,584
太冷了
It's freezing!

859
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,667
你看到他們在造的新東西嗎？
Have you see this new thing that they're building?

860
01:30:19,792 --> 01:30:22,209
像一個大糧倉
It looks like a giant barn.

861
01:30:25,292 --> 01:30:27,292
我去一下洗手間
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

862
01:30:37,042 --> 01:30:39,084
我去燒水
I'll put the kettle on.

863
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,625
Celia Steimer的家人和朋友
Family and friends of Celia Steimer

864
01:30:54,084 --> 01:30:55,709
正協助警方尋找她
are doing everything possible to help police find her.

865
01:30:55,834 --> 01:30:59,167
超過50名志願者從水路尋找失蹤女孩
More than 50 volunteers are now scouring waterways and bushlands

866
01:30:59,292 --> 01:31:00,875
在馬歇爾路森林
in the Marshall road forest.

867
01:31:01,042 --> 01:31:03,542
這位16歲的中學生
The 16-year-old Rapari Junction HS student

868
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:05,792
失蹤超過一周
has been missing now for more than a week.

869
01:31:05,959 --> 01:31:07,709
Robin Farland探員表示
Detective Robin Farland says

870
01:31:07,792 --> 01:31:10,417
他們不得不考慮種種可能性
they have to consider every option.

871
01:31:10,542 --> 01:31:13,667
她還表示一位當地市民正在幫助他們的調查
She acknowledged a local man is helping them with their inquiries

872
01:31:13,875 --> 01:31:15,750
警方將會拜訪當地的每一家人
and the police will be visiting every house in the area.

873
01:31:34,584 --> 01:31:36,334
他不會有事的
He'll be fine.

874
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:39,042
讓他們處理吧
Let them handle it.

875
01:32:24,834 --> 01:32:26,084
請用煙灰缸
Please just use an ashtray.

876
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:27,125
好的
Okay.

877
01:32:28,375 --> 01:32:30,917
聽著，我跟Alexandria的律師談過了
Listen, I spoke to the lawyer in Alexandria

878
01:32:31,042 --> 01:32:33,625
他過去處理過這樣的事
and he reckons he's handled this sort of thing before.

879
01:32:34,792 --> 01:32:37,334
他想讓你明天一早給他打個電話
He wants you to give him a call first thing in the morning.

880
01:32:39,084 --> 01:32:44,084
嘿，你說怎樣的性交姿勢能生出最醜的孩子
Hey, what sexual position creates the ugliest offspring?

881
01:32:47,667 --> 01:32:49,292
怎樣的性交姿勢能生出...
What sexual position creates--

882
01:32:49,459 --> 01:32:50,334
我不知道, Paul
I don't know, Paul.

883
01:32:51,292 --> 01:32:53,417
問問你媽
Ask your mother.

884
01:32:56,167 --> 01:32:58,500
你能想像如果她現在看到我們會怎樣嗎？
Can you imagine if she saw us now?

885
01:32:58,792 --> 01:33:01,292
你能想像嗎，你覺得她會說什麼？
Can you imagine that? What do you think she'd say?

886
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,209
兄弟倆邊喝邊談
Two brothers having a drink and a chat.

887
01:33:04,334 --> 01:33:06,959
你說呢？她會驕傲嗎？
What do you think? She'd be proud, or what?

888
01:33:10,042 --> 01:33:11,584
你在說什麼？
Why are you doing this?

889
01:33:11,917 --> 01:33:12,625
什麼什麼？
Doing what?

890
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,250
你知道什麼
You know exactly what.

891
01:33:15,084 --> 01:33:16,334
你為什麼就不能跟我說
Why can't you just talk to me?

892
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:26,042
去你的
Fuck you.

893
01:33:27,459 --> 01:33:30,875
你他媽在看什麼？沒見過兄弟倆說話？
What the fuck are you looking at? Never seen two brothers talking before?

894
01:33:38,542 --> 01:33:40,917
你想談，那我們談
You want to talk, let's talk.

895
01:33:41,042 --> 01:33:43,167
別忘了你醉醺醺闖到這裡
Forget the fact you come in here blind drunk

896
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:46,542
打斷我的會議，忽然就提起媽來了
and interrupt a meeting but then you just bring up mom like that?

897
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:49,792
我說你怎麼敢？我知道你現在不太好, Paul,
I mean how dare you? I realize you are in a spot of bother, Paul,

898
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:52,584
不過那並不代表你可以這樣做
but that doesn't give you the right to behave like this.

899
01:33:52,709 --> 01:33:55,042
想知道真相？你從來就沒有關心過母親
The truth? You were never there for mom.

900
01:33:55,125 --> 01:33:57,167
她病的時候，你在哪裡
When she was sick, where the hell were you?

901
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:59,125
太好了，現在你有意見了，好啊，Andrew
Brilliant. So you do have an opinion. OK Andrew.

902
01:33:59,334 --> 01:34:00,792
你他媽什麼意思？我都不能接近她
What the fuck is that supposed to mean? I couldn't get near her.

903
01:34:00,875 --> 01:34:04,375
都怪我好了，我還得扮演你的角色，忘了嗎？
Blame it all on me. I had to be you. Did you know that?

904
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:07,042
你他媽想想清楚
You made fucking sure of it.

905
01:34:07,125 --> 01:34:09,042
快樂的三人世界：Andy，媽媽，還有上帝
The happy little fucking threesome: Andy, mom and God.

906
01:34:09,209 --> 01:34:09,875
沒有別人打擾
No one else invited.

907
01:34:09,959 --> 01:34:11,167
你拋棄了她
You abandoned her.

908
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:14,667
你拋棄了她, Paul. 你從來沒有邁出一步...
You abandoned her, Paul. And you never took one single step towards--

909
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:16,209
你沒忘了爸吧

910
01:34:16,292 --> 01:34:18,750
他做錯過事，可是他接受了我
at least for all his faults, he let me in. He let me in.

911
01:34:18,834 --> 01:34:22,292
你連他的葬禮都沒有趕到 現卻在站在這裡為他說話
You were late for his funeral, remember? And you're gonna stand here defending for him.

912
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:25,084
聽我說，Paul，你聽我說
Listen to me Paul, you listen, listen to me.

913
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,084
有時候我看著你
You know sometimes I look at you

914
01:34:29,167 --> 01:34:31,209
看到的都是他
and all I see is him.

915
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:34,375
只是他
Just him.

916
01:34:34,542 --> 01:34:36,750
那令我沮喪
I find that quite disheartening.

917
01:34:41,917 --> 01:34:45,084
至少我沒他媽娶我的媽
Yeah well, at least I didn't marry my fucking mother.

918
01:34:50,959 --> 01:34:54,000
她一直是那樣的，還是只有見到你時那樣？
Has she always been like that or just when she met you?

919
01:34:55,209 --> 01:34:57,292
去死吧，Paul
Go to hell, Paul.

920
01:35:10,334 --> 01:35:14,584
警察表示血跡屬於失蹤的女孩
Police confirm blood traces belong to missing girl.

921
01:35:16,209 --> 01:35:18,167
打開
Just open it!

922
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,167
Celia, 把信封給我
Celia, give me the fucking letter carta.

923
01:36:57,959 --> 01:36:59,625
沒用的
It doesn't matter.

924
01:37:13,292 --> 01:37:14,709
打開，打開好嗎？
Open it. Will you just open it?

925
01:37:14,875 --> 01:37:15,750
不，別打開
No! Don't open it.

926
01:37:16,375 --> 01:37:17,250
打開
Open it!

927
01:37:17,417 --> 01:37:18,292
我不想
I don't want to.

928
01:37:24,334 --> 01:37:25,042
不想？
No?

929
01:37:25,375 --> 01:37:26,084
不想
No.

930
01:37:47,292 --> 01:37:49,667
誰得了第一呢？
Wonder who came in first?

931
01:38:02,167 --> 01:38:03,875
在兩千多名參賽者中
Amid the 2000 or so entries

932
01:38:03,959 --> 01:38:05,959
我們很欣賞Steimers小姐的文章
we were delighted with Ms Steimers' story.

933
01:38:06,084 --> 01:38:09,167
這篇作品顯示了一個年輕人的才華
This work shows an emerging remarkable talent for someone so young.

934
01:38:09,709 --> 01:38:12,084
它捕獲了一種美感，神秘感，和迷失感
It catches a sense of beauty, mystery and loss

935
01:38:12,167 --> 01:38:14,584
同時並未喪失清醒
without ever losing sight of what might be.

936
01:38:15,084 --> 01:38:17,250
誰第一...
You wonder who came first?

937
01:38:21,459 --> 01:38:23,292
我來告訴你
I'll tell you who came first.

938
01:38:23,417 --> 01:38:26,834
很可能是年長你三倍的某個人 值得拿第一的某個人
Someone three times your age, probably, someone who bloody well deserved to come first.

939
01:38:43,667 --> 01:38:46,167
謝謝你讓我感覺如此特別
Thank you for making it special for me.

940
01:38:49,584 --> 01:38:51,334
小屋，還有其他一切
The den and everything.

941
01:39:03,584 --> 01:39:06,625
我要抽根煙，來享受這美景
I need a cigarette to cope with this sort of scenery.

942
01:39:07,167 --> 01:39:09,084
我去車裡拿煙，馬上回來
In the car.I'll be back in a tic.

943
01:39:09,334 --> 01:39:11,375
能把外套給我嗎？
Can you leave me your jacket?

944
01:40:14,792 --> 01:40:18,750
你今晚出門嗎，我想要你看著Sam
Are you gonna be home tonight? I need you to baby sit Sam.

945
01:40:22,625 --> 01:40:24,917
Celia, 我在跟你說話
Celia, I asked you a question.

946
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:41,834
該死
Fuck!

947
01:41:07,125 --> 01:41:09,209
他是我爸爸嗎？
Is he my father?

948
01:41:19,459 --> 01:41:21,917
如果是那樣簡單就好了
I wish it were that simple.

949
01:41:33,709 --> 01:41:35,209
嘿
Hey, you!

950
01:41:39,167 --> 01:41:40,709
怎麼了
What's up?

951
01:41:59,959 --> 01:42:01,667
你知道嗎？
Did you know?

952
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:04,792
你知道嗎？
Did you know?

953
01:42:05,417 --> 01:42:08,209
回答我，你知道嗎？
Answer me! Did you know?

954
01:42:09,417 --> 01:42:11,250
哦, Celia...
Oh, Celia...

955
01:42:17,292 --> 01:42:20,375
我知道你拍下那個女孩的照片之後做了什麼
I know what you did when you took the photo of that girl.

956
01:42:21,584 --> 01:42:23,750
你走開了，你離開了她
You walked away and left her.

957
01:42:23,917 --> 01:42:27,000
那就是你退出提名的原因，這樣你不用再為此困擾了
That's why you withdrew the entry so you wouldn't even have to deal with her.

958
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:28,667
你不知道...
You don't know--

959
01:42:28,792 --> 01:42:29,709
別說了
don't!

960
01:42:31,334 --> 01:42:33,417
她只是另一張照片嗎？
Was she just another photo?

961
01:42:35,042 --> 01:42:38,875
只是你為了解開該死的戰爭迷題 拍下的一張照片嗎？
Just another picture of this fucking war puzzle that you try to figure out?

962
01:42:42,084 --> 01:42:44,125
她是另一個我嗎？
Was she just like me?

963
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:46,209
她是另一個我嗎？
Was she just like me?

964
01:42:46,375 --> 01:42:50,584
她只是你隨便扔掉和忘記的人嗎？
Was she just someone you could pick up and throw away and forget about?

965
01:43:01,334 --> 01:43:03,792
你怎麼可以這樣
How do you live with yourself?

966
01:43:21,584 --> 01:43:23,667
Andrew! Penny!
Andrew! Penny!

967
01:43:24,209 --> 01:43:25,750
你們在嗎？
Are you there?

968
01:43:28,209 --> 01:43:30,042
開開門
Will you just open the door?

969
01:43:33,959 --> 01:43:36,000
我只是想要個落腳之處
I just need somewhere to stay.

970
01:43:40,834 --> 01:43:42,834
Penny, 我知道你在裡面
Come on Penny, I know you're in there.

971
01:44:05,667 --> 01:44:08,125
Jonathan, 報紙上寫的那些
You know Jonathan, all that stuff in the papers,

972
01:44:08,334 --> 01:44:10,334
只是猜測
that's all just speculation.

973
01:44:10,834 --> 01:44:13,167
都是垃圾
All right? It's rubbish.

974
01:44:13,292 --> 01:44:15,334
他們沒有證據
They have no proof.

975
01:44:21,042 --> 01:44:23,084
我還是你的叔叔
I'm still your uncle.

976
01:44:28,959 --> 01:44:30,667
不，你不是
No you're not.

977
01:44:30,792 --> 01:44:32,834
我們都覺得你他媽太笨了
We both think you're fucking stupid.

978
01:44:32,959 --> 01:44:33,917
你說什麼？
What did you say?

979
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:34,959
放開我
Leave me alone!

980
01:44:35,084 --> 01:44:38,042
我希望他們殺了你
I hope they kill you.

981
01:44:38,167 --> 01:44:40,542
我希望他們...
I hope they--

982
01:44:40,750 --> 01:44:43,042
沒事的
It's okay!

983
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:51,084
沒事的，我知道你喜歡她
It's alright. I know you like her.

984
01:44:54,792 --> 01:44:57,125
聽著，你得告訴我「你們」是什麼意思
Listen, you have to tell me what you meant by "both of you".

985
01:44:58,125 --> 01:44:59,292
看著我
Look at me.

986
01:44:59,417 --> 01:45:02,000
「我們都覺得你很笨」是什麼意思？
What did you mean by "both of us think you're stupid"?

987
01:45:02,084 --> 01:45:04,459
告訴我「我們」是誰
Tell me what you meant by "both of us".

988
01:45:04,584 --> 01:45:07,500
我不會傷害你，我保證不會傷害你
I'm not gonna hurt you. I promise I won't hurt you.

989
01:45:12,792 --> 01:45:14,292
什麼意思, Jonathan？
What is it, Jonathan?

990
01:45:15,417 --> 01:45:17,750
我在找我的相機
I was looking for my camera.

991
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,792
我以為他藏起來是為了保護你
I thought he was hiding it to protect you.

992
01:45:49,792 --> 01:45:51,375
他在哪兒
Where is he?

993
01:45:51,542 --> 01:45:54,125
明天以前都在教堂
In Christchurch till tomorrow.

994
01:46:06,209 --> 01:46:07,750
Paul!
Paul!

995
01:46:09,167 --> 01:46:10,834
Paul, 你在嗎？
Paul, are you there?

996
01:46:14,834 --> 01:46:16,125
河邊
RIVER

997
01:46:28,959 --> 01:46:31,250
我剛聽律師說
I just heard from the lawyer.

998
01:46:31,375 --> 01:46:33,209
你不想賣是什麼意思？
What do you mean you don't want to sell?

999
01:46:33,334 --> 01:46:35,417
你不行，我手頭正緊...
You can't. I'm up to my eyeballs--

1000
01:46:39,584 --> 01:46:40,917
你他媽在幹嘛
What the hell did you do that for?

1001
01:46:41,042 --> 01:46:41,959
起來
Get up!

1002
01:46:42,834 --> 01:46:44,667
起來
Get up!

1003
01:46:48,417 --> 01:46:51,667
你想做什麼？把它藏到我家，跟那張地圖一樣？
What were you going to do? Plant it at my place like the atlas?

1004
01:46:51,792 --> 01:46:53,750
你不需要這樣的
This is really unnecessary

1005
01:46:53,875 --> 01:46:55,750
好吧，好吧
Okay! Okay!

1006
01:47:03,042 --> 01:47:05,834
我曾經想過你為什麼就那樣走了
There was a time I wondered why you up and left.

1007
01:47:06,875 --> 01:47:09,334
你知道他要做什麼的，不是嗎？
You knew what he was up to, didn't you?

1008
01:47:09,834 --> 01:47:11,709
至少看著我說
At least look at me and tell me

1009
01:47:11,792 --> 01:47:13,750
在你扣動扳機之前
before you pull the trigger.

1010
01:47:17,625 --> 01:47:19,625
你知道最可悲的是什麼嗎？
You know the really sad part?

1011
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:23,459
直到看了遺囑，我才知道
I didn't even find out until I read the will.

1012
01:47:23,625 --> 01:47:25,917
我是那樣無知
That's how far back I was.

1013
01:47:26,625 --> 01:47:28,584
那時我怎麼會懂, Paul
But then how was I to know, Paul?

1014
01:47:28,709 --> 01:47:31,250
我還是個孩子，十五歲的孩子
I was only a kid, a 15-year-old kid.

1015
01:47:32,417 --> 01:47:35,875
你走得一乾二淨，把我留給了那個卑賤的人
You killed me when you walked away and left me with that evil piece of scum.

1016
01:47:35,959 --> 01:47:38,917
你以為你他媽會有第二次機會？
You think you even get a second fucking chance?

1017
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,792
你知道的，畜牲
You knew, you bastard!

1018
01:47:40,917 --> 01:47:44,375
你還有膽回來，把那野種帶到我們家
And you had the gall to come back here and bring that thing into our house.

1019
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:46,542
我媽媽的家！
My mother's house!

1020
01:47:46,875 --> 01:47:50,000
天知道你和她幹了些什麼，有其父必有其子
And god knows what you're doing with her, but then like father like son.

1021
01:47:50,084 --> 01:47:52,584
Andrew, 你他媽不知道你在說什麼
Andrew, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

1022
01:48:02,875 --> 01:48:05,042
他幹了你那年輕的婊子
He was screwing that teenage whore of yours.

1023
01:48:05,125 --> 01:48:05,542
不!
No!

1024
01:48:05,750 --> 01:48:06,584
- 他干了，你知道的 - 不!
- He was. You knew it. - No!

1025
01:48:06,667 --> 01:48:08,125
你走開了
And you walked.

1026
01:48:08,209 --> 01:48:10,042
Andrew，別說了，這他媽與你無關
Andrew no! It's got nothing to fucking do with you!

1027
01:48:10,292 --> 01:48:11,625
你親眼看見了
You saw it with your own eyes!

1028
01:48:11,917
