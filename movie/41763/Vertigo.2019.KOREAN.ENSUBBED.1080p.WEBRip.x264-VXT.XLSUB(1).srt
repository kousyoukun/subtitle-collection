All right. Step number two coming up.

127

I'm going right out and buy myself a nice tall stepladder.

128
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,377

Take it easy now.

All right, now here we go.

131
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:00,288

132
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,157
�ڴ¤W��  �ڴ¤U��

How did you get in the shipbuilding business, Gavin?

135
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,422

I married into it.

136
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:41,156

Very interesting business.

137
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,733

No, to be honest, I find it dull.

138
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,964
�A�����a���ͬ�
Well, you don't have to do it for a living.

139
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,529
�O��  ���A�o�t�d��
No, but one assumes responsibilities.

140
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,203
�کd�l���a�H���h�@�F
My wife's family is all gone.

141
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,105
�o���H�Ӭݦo���ͷN
Someone has to look after her interests.

00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,173
�o���˪��X�٤H�b�F���g�礽�q����t  �b�ں�����
Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East, Baitimore.

00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:03,011
�ҥH�ڨM�w  �J�M�n�F  �ڴN�^�ӷF
So I decided, as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here.

144
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,421
�ڤ@���ܳ��w�o��
I've always liked it here.

How long have you been back?

146
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,151

You like it, huh?

148
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,760

Well, San Francisco's changed.

149
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,735
�Tÿ���l�ާڪ��F�西�b���t����
The things that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.

150
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,538

Like all these.

151
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:26,001

Yes. I should have liked to have lived here then.

152
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:27,910

Color, excitement, power.

153
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,876

Freedom.

154
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,248

Shouldn't you be sitting down?

No. No, I'm all right.

156
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,758

I was sorry to read about that thing in the paper.

157
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,417
�A��¾������ĵ�F
And you've quit the force.

158
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,194
�O�ä[�ݯe��
Is it a permanent physical disability?

159
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,695
��  ��
No, no.

160
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,877
�u���L�ڤ��દ�ӱ�
It just means that I can't climb stairs 

161
00:12:46,877 --> 00:12:49,098
����h�~�Ϊ̰����a��
That are too steep or go to high places,

162
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,568

163
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,265

But, there are plenty of street-level bars in this town.

164
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,433
�A�{�b�Q�ܤ@�M��

No, I don't think so. No, it's a little early in the day for me.

Well, I guess that just about covers everything, doesn't it?

167
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:10,686
�ڱq�S���L�B  �ܤ֨��ѦP��
I never married. I don't see much of the old college gang,

I'm a retired detective, and you're in the shipbuilding business.

I asked you to come up here, Scottie,

171
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,427
�O���D�A���������F
Knowing that you'd quit detective work.

172
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:28,229

But I wondered whether you'd go back on the job as a special favor to me.

Well, then...

176
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,413

I'm afraid some harm may come to her.

177
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,814

From whom?

180
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,724

No.

182
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:58,151

If I told you that I believe this has happened to my wife,

What would you say?

184
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:03,933

185
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:08,070

00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,984

210
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:34,289

Got into her car and drove out to Golden Gate Park, five miles.

00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,128

Sat by the lake,

Staring across the water at the pillars that stand on the far shore.

�������d���S���Ӵ_��
Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead

Yes.

Oh, yeah.

58
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,105

You notice the way she does her hair?

00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:35,975

You know, there's something else.

60
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,103

My wife, Madeleine,

61
00:38:37,103 --> 00:38:40,507
�o���X���ݩ�d���S���]�_����
Has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta.

62
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,449

She inherited them.

63
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,182
�q���a�L  ���ӹL�ɤF
Never wore them. They were too old-fashioned.

64
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:46,587
���ܲ{�b
Until now.

65
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:51,226
�{�b  ���o�W�B���ɭ�  �o�|���X�Ӭ�
Now, when she's alone, she takes them out and looks at them,

66
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,820
�n�_�a  �p���l�l�aĲ�N�ۥ���  
Handles them gently, curiously.

67
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:58,502
�N�������W�þ�������l�̪��ۤv
Puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror.

00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:02,027
�i�J�t�@�@��  �S�ܦ��t�@�ӤH
And goes into that other world, is someone else again.

69
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,406
����  �d���S�P�˺��w���O��
Now, Carlotta Valdes was what?

70
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,706
�A�ӤӪ�����?
Your wife's grandmother?

71
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,609
������
Great-grandmother.

72
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,841
���ӳQ�a�����p��
Now, the child who was taken from her,

73
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,677
���Өϥd���S�Ʊ��æ۱����p��
Whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death,

74
00:39:14,677 --> 00:39:16,478
�O���w�Y������
Was Madeleine's grandmother.

75
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:20,819
�٦����_���J���]�O�ѥ˺��w�����a
And the Mckittrick Hotel is the old Valdes home.

76
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,189
�ڷQ���N���o�q�F
Well, I think that explains it.

77
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:28,721
����H�墨�˪��L�h���|�I�g
Anyone could become obsessed with the past with a background like that.

78
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,168
�o�q��ť�L�d���S�P�˺��w������

79
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:35,497
�o��hù�p�ѥD��~���X��
She knows nothing of a grave out at the Mission Dolores?

80
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,371
�Ϊ̮J�}�j��W���ѩФl���@�L�Ҫ�?

82
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,714
���o�h�o�Ǧa�誺�ɭ�...

83
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,807
�o�N���A�O�ڪ��d�l�F
She's no longer my wife.

84
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:51,246

Well, how do you know all these things she doesn't?

85
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,519
�o�����{�׫e�i�D�F�ڤ@��
Her mother told me most of them before she died.

86
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,685
��l���O�ڦۤv�o�{��
I dug out the rest for myself here.

87
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,820

Why wouldn't she tell her daughter?

88
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,329

Natural fear.

89
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:03,826
�o�������w�믫�f�۱���
Her grandmother went insane, took her own life.

90
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,427
���w�Y������̯d�ۦo����
Her blood is in Madeleine.

You'll want this.

100
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:49,738

On having once saved the woman's life,

190
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:06,853

���g�b�����չϦ۱�
She threw herself into the bay.

192
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:13,137

It is a pity that knowing her suicidal tendencies,

193
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:16,944

He did not make a greater effort the second time.

197
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:35,203

He did not remain at the scene of the death. He left.

200
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:45,907
�L�n�٦ۤv���ɸ����@���ť�
He claims he suffered a mental blackout

205
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:04,340

He couid not face the tragic resuit of his own weakness

206
01:21:04,559 --> 01:21:06,134

And ran away.

And so you found me.

32
01:40:06,133 --> 01:40:08,727

Now I'll go, and you can give up your search.

I want you to have peace of mind.

You've nothing to blame yourself for.

38
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:24,874

You were the victim.

39
01:40:24,952 --> 01:40:25,783

I was the tool,

40
01:40:25,783 --> 01:40:29,821
�A�O�[��P�J�����S�Ѯ`�d�l�����`��
And you were the victim of Gavin Elster's plan to murder his wife.

41
01:40:29,890 --> 01:40:32,939
�L��ڬO�]���ڹ��o

He dressed me up like her.

43
01:40:34,595 --> 01:40:36,570

It was quite safe because she lived

in the country and rarely came to town.

45
01:40:38,899 --> 01:40:41,800

He chose you to be the witness to a suicide.

46
01:40:42,469 --> 01:40:45,336
�d���S���G�ƥb�u�b��
The Carlotta story was part real, part invented,

He knew of your illness.

49
01:40:50,808 --> 01:40:53,879

He knew you'd never get up the stairs to the tower.

50
01:40:53,947 --> 01:40:56,848
�p�e�ܩP�K  �L�S���X��

51
01:40:58,385 --> 01:41:00,876

I made the mistake. I fell in love.

01:41:01,455 --> 01:41:03,685

That wasn't part of the plan.

53
01:41:04,458 --> 01:41:08,087

Hoping that I could make you love me again

As I am for myself.

Oh, here. Here, I'll do it.

221
02:00:16,676 --> 02:00:18,701

And then, I'll be free of the past.

Scottie, why are we here?

I told you.

224
02:00:45,638 --> 02:00:47,868

I have to go back into the past once more.

225
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:52,343

Just once more, for the last time.

Why? Why here?

02:01:04,523 --> 02:01:07,924

Right there.

234
02:01:18,504 --> 02:01:21,200

We stood there, and I kissed her for the last time.

02:01:21,274 --> 02:01:22,707

And then she turned

And ran into the church.

And when I followed her, it was too late.

I don't wanna go in there!

It's too late.

She was running up the tower.

One doesn't often get a second chance.

Remember?

Now, we'll see. We'll see. This is my second chance.

But you knew that day that I wouldn't be able to follow you, didn't you?

02:04:17,516 --> 02:04:19,984
�A�W�h���ɭԽ֦b����  �J�����S�M�L�d�l��
Who was up there when you got up there? Elster and his wife?

You were the copy. You were the counterfeit, weren't you?

274
02:04:29,428 --> 02:04:32,659
�L�t���o  �L�S�������I  ��a
He'd broken her neck. Wasn't taking any chances, was he?

275
02:04:32,731 --> 02:04:35,063
���A�W�h��  �L��o���U�h�F
So, when you got up there, he pushed her off the tower,

276
02:04:35,134 --> 02:04:37,534
���y�s�O�A��  �A�F�ܥs��

If you wanted to stop it, why did you scream,

Since you tricked me so well up to then?

Not only the clothes and the hair,

02:04:54,954 --> 02:04:57,582

But the looks, and the manner, and the words,

And those beautiful phony trances.

285
02:04:59,425 --> 02:05:01,586

And you jumped into the bay, didn't you?
