老调重弹的错误

4
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,550
美国在东欧问题上的缺乏主动性
The United States' lack of action in Eastern Europe...

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,160
证明了苏联在阿富汗边界的侵略行为…
... proves that the Soviet Union's aggression at the Afghan border...

6
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,490
是不会受到美国的公开反对的
... will not be opposed publicly by the United States.

7
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,870
事件如下： 苏联继续进行着当下的一系列军事演习…
Issue: The Soviet Union continued its recent series of military exercises...

8
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,270

President Richard Nixon issued this warning to the Soviets:

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,570
美国从不主动引发战争
MAN 2: The United States does not start fights.

12
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,420
我在此声明：为了维护和平…
Let it be clear we maintain our strength...

13
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,390
我们将保留我们的武力
...in order to maintain peace...

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,290
所以美国的敌对者们，请扪心自问：
...so any adversary should ask themselves:

15
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,520
攻击美国所带来的后果
"Do the consequences of attacking America...

16
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,330
真的是利大于弊吗？
...outweigh the potential benefits?"

17
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,130
苏联近来的行动使得…
As a result of the Soviet activity...

18
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,100
由核武器科学家组成的监察小组…
...the watchdog group of nuclear scientists...

19
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:25,680
将“末日时钟”的指针拨到了差5分钟到…
... moved the Doomsday Clock up to five minutes until midnight:

20
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,150
预示着核战争的午夜
Destruction by nuclear war.

21
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,550
问题是：
Question:

22
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,350
用0到10来衡量，0代表不可能…
On a scale of zero to 10, zero meaning impossibility...

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,860
10代表理论上的完全可能
...10 meaning complete metaphysical certitude...

24
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,520
俄罗斯人进攻美国的可能性到底有多大？

０
Zero.

27
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,290
苏联人不会冒险发动战争的
The Soviets would never risk going to war...

28
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,300
因为我们有着一件流动的核武器
...when we have a walking nuclear deterrent on our side.

29
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,940
当然你说的是曼哈顿博士
You're referring, of course, to Dr. Manhattan...

30
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,210
但是曼哈顿博士的存在真能够保证世界和平吗？ 伊琳娜·克里夫特
... but does Dr. Manhattan's existence guarantee world peace? Eleanor Clift.

31
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,110
他的存在并没有让苏联停止…
Well, it hasn't stopped the Soviet Union...

32
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,950
囤积创纪录数量的核武器
... from stockpiling record amounts of nuclear weapons.

33
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,820
你不觉得那只是吓唬人的？
You don't think it's just posturing?

34
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,580
或许苏联作这些…
Maybe the reason why the Soviets...

35
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,280
炸弹试验的原因…
...are doing these bomb tests...

36
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,830
只是因为他们觉得曼哈顿博士本身是个威胁
...is because they feel threatened by Dr. Manhattan. Of course.

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,530
或许全世界都觉得是
Maybe the whole world feels like that.

38
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,010
苏联的船只已经侵犯了领海
Soviet ships have violated the territorial waters...

39
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,070
我想，这迟早是要来的

40
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,370
这是个玩笑，全都是个玩笑

119
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,800
不，我肯定听到了些动静
No, I definitely heard something.

120

守着门
Watch the door.

121
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,300
嘘
Shh.

122
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,740
一定是风吹的，下次你…
Must've been the wind. Next time you...

123
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:10,490
这一切都是从小混混开始的，人们想忘记这点
MAN: It all started with the gangs. You know, people tend to forget that.

124
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,260
海盗、鬼魂装扮
Pirate outfits, ghosts.

125
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,030
他们觉得那样很有趣：精心打扮去抢劫
They thought it was funny: Dress up and pull heists.

126
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,430
我们逮捕他们之后，却马上又被放出来
As soon as we'd arrest them, they'd be back on the street.

127
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,440
没人能够指证他们，正是因为那些该死的面具
Nobody could pick them out of a lineup because of the damn masks.

128
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,880
所以，我们几个警察，聚在一起…
So a few of us cops, we get together...

129
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,420
然后得出结论： 去他妈的，我们也蒙面
...and we figure, what the heck, we'll mask up, too.

130
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,280
我们要做法律做不到的事情
We'll finish what the law couldn't.

131
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:39,120
很快，报纸也收到风声，他们也跟风…
Pretty soon, the papers get wind of it. They ran with it...

132
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,960
噢，老天，我们是整个国家的消遣啊
...and oh, boy, we're a national pastime.

133
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:46,620
那时有我、账单、飞蛾侠…
It was me, Dollar Bill, Mothman...

134
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,170
都会队长、正义头罩…
...Captain Metropolis, Hooded Justice...

135
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,530
丝鬼还有笑匠
...Silk Spectre and the Comedian.

136
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:57,230
噢，别让我提到他
Oh, don't get me started on him.

137
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,440
我一定喝多了，居然又向你说起这件伤心事
I must be drunk already, telling you this sob story again.

138
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,480
我想你应该开始说到重点了
I think you were trying to make a point.

139
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:12,550
好吧，重点是，我们起头太容易了 后来发生在你们身上的事情是不公平的
Well, my point is that we had it too easy. It wasn't fair what happened to you guys...

140
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,860
你们接手的是我们留下的烂摊子 还有尼克松强迫你们引退
You guys who picked up where we left off. - With Nixon forcing you out.

141
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,360
尼克松，噢，那个变态 想起来我还投票给这家伙5次
Nixon, oh, that prick. To think I voted for that prick five times.

142
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,270
嘿，不选他就只有共产党了，不是吗？
Hey, it was him or the commies, right?

143
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:31,870
噢，差不多到午夜了，该走了
Oh, wow, it's almost midnight. Gotta go.

144
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,040
想听真话吗？
Truth?

145
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,450
你是个我永远比不上的夜枭，丹尼小子
You were a better Nite Owl than I ever was, Danny boy.

146
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,350
- 霍利斯，我们都知道这是屁话 - 嘿！
- Hollis, we both know that's bullshit. - Hey.

147
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,790
说这话注意点
Watch it with the language.

148
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,590
这仍然是那只曾让艾克西斯队长趴下的左拳 还记得吗？
This is the left hook that floored Captain Axis, remember?

149
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,130
- 当然 - 最新报道
- Yeah. WOMAN [ON TV]: This just in:

150
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,230
那位被称作“罗夏”的蒙面义警…
The masked vigilante known as Rorschach...

151
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,230
在凌晨时分袭击了一位警察
... has assaulted a police officer in the early-morning hours.

152
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,090
他由于违反了6年前 用于驱逐蒙面英雄的“基恩法案”…
Rorschach is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list...

153
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,070
而成为了联邦调查局的头号通缉犯
... for violation of the Keene Act, which banned masked heroes six years ago.

154
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,510
罗夏不断地使…
Rorschach reportedly incapacitated...

155
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,450
他们驱逐了所有人却留下他
Forced everyone out except him.

156
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,140
噢，他会退出的
Oh, he'll quit.

157
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,650
在他死的时候
When he's dead.

158
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,380
- 下周见？ - 其实…
DAN: Next week? HOLLIS: Well...

159
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:18,150
你没必要一直地讨我欢心
...you know, you don't have to keep humoring me like this.

160
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,490
如果你有个热辣的约会对象之类的…
If you got a hot date or something...

161
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,460
嘿，我们这些退休人员应该常聚，不是吗？
Hey, us retired guys have to stick together, right?

162
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,100
你怀念过那些日子吗？
You ever miss it?

163
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,390
没，你呢？
No. You?

164
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,770
噢，去它的，没
Oh, heck, no.

165
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,840
回见了
Be seeing you.

166
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,700
（梅森汽修）

167
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,330
（专修老车）

168
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,660
（乡愁：由维特公司献上）

169
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,910
你好，丹尼尔
Hello, Daniel.

170
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,740
罗夏
Rorschach.

171
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,120
我用些豆子招呼了自己，希望你别介意
Helped myself to some beans. Hope you don't mind.

172
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,730
不，不，当然不介意
No, no. Course not.

173
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,890
你要我给你热热吗？
You want me to heat those up for you?

174
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,590
这样就好
Fine like this.

175
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,360
最近都在忙些什么？
How have you been keeping?

176
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,540
流亡
RORSCHACH: Out of prison.

177
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,470
我听了新闻
Heard about you on the news.

178
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,310
据说你袭击了一位警察
Say you attacked a cop.

179
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,250
轻伤，连医院都不用去
RORSCHACH: Minor wound. Won't need hospitalization.

180
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,280
丹尼尔…
Daniel...

181
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,750
看看这个
...Iook at this.

182
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,160
- 这是豆汁吗？ - 这是“人汁”
DAN: Is this bean juice? RORSCHACH: Human bean juice.

183
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,360
这是笑匠的胸章，血也是，他死了
Badge belonged to the Comedian. Blood too. He's dead.

184
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,840
我们到下面谈吧
Let's talk downstairs.

185
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,510
可能是入室行窃
DAN: It could have been a burglary.

186
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,380
或许凶手不知道他是笑匠
Maybe the killer didn't know who the Comedian was.

187
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:04,290
普通的偷盗犯？杀了笑匠？荒谬
RORSCHACH: An ordinary burglar? Kill the Comedian? Ridiculous.

188
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,300
我听说他自从1977年后一直为政府做些…
I heard he'd been working for the government since '77...

189
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,630
推翻南美洲的某些马克思主义共和政府的工作
...knocking over Marxist republics in South America.

190
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,730
或许这只是一起政治谋杀什么的
Maybe it was a political killing or something.

191
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,160
或许
Maybe.

192
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,600
或许有人正在铲除变装英雄们
Maybe someone's picking off costumed heroes.

193
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,870
你不觉得有点神经质了吗？
DAN: You don't think that's a little paranoid?

194
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,600
这就是他们用来形容我的？
That what they say about me now?

195
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,110
神经质？
Paranoid?

196
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,110
听着，笑匠在那些日子里得罪了不少人…
DAN: Look, Comedian made a lot of enemies over the years...

197
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,770
甚至得罪了些朋友
...even among his friends.

198
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,110
说起朋友，霍利斯·梅森还好吗？ （一，二代夜枭是好朋友，就是刚刚喝酒的两位）
RORSCHACH: Speaking of friends, how's Hollis Mason?

199
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,950
他写了本书，书里有些关于笑匠的坏话
He wrote that book. Said some bad things about the Comedian in it.

200
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:43,190
我不喜欢你暗示的东西 也不喜欢被跟踪
I don't like what you're implying, and I like being followed even less.

201
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:48,190
或许我只是照看着你 免得有蒙面英雄杀手找上门
Maybe I was keeping an eye on you, in case someone's gunning for masks.

202
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:53,030
- 你不是多愁善感的人 - 袭击我们中的一个，就等于袭击我们全部
- You were never that sentimental. - Attack on one is attack on all of us.

203
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,910
那你建议我们该干些什么？
What do you suggest we do about it?

204
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:57,970
报偿笑匠
Retribution.

205
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,680
- 守望者已经完了 - 狡猾迪克（对尼克松的蔑称）说的
- Watchmen are over. - Says Tricky Dick.

206
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,610
我说的
Says me.

207
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,850
你的真实身份还没有被公开
Nobody knows who you are.

208
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,990
你可以放弃追查，过上正常的生活
You can give it up, try and have a normal life.

209
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,060
就像你过的生活？正常的？
That what you have now? A normal life?

210
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,430
当你走过这座好像快死的疯狗一样的城市…
When you walk down the street in a city dying of rabies...

211
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,070
走过那些谈论着…
...past the human cockroaches...

212
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,000
毒品和儿童色情电影的人类毒虫时…
...talking about their heroin and child pornography...

213
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,700
你真觉得很正常？
...do you really feel normal?

214
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,610
至少我不是那个至今还活在面具之后的人
Least I'm not the one still hiding behind a mask.

215
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,740
不
No.

216
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,540
你躲藏在大众这副面具之后
You're hiding in plain sight.

217
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,080
回头见，丹
Be seeing you, Dan.

218
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,060
有个维护用的天井会带你到 离这里两个街区的北边
A maintenance hatch will let you out two blocks north.

219
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,950
嗯，我还记得
Yeah, I remember.

220
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,190
我常来这，当我们还是搭档的时候
Came here often, when we were partners.

221
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,260
那的确是段好时光，罗夏…
DAN: Those were great times, huh, Rorschach?

222
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,000
- 到底怎么了？ - 你退出了
- What happened? - You quit.

223
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,650
（1965年，罗夏曾和夜枭2代携手对抗黑手党

224
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:11,520
后来尼克松出台“基恩法案” 要求蒙面英雄
要么为政府工作要么退休

225
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,930
夜枭2代选择了退休，而罗夏选择了一个人战斗）

226
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,650
罗夏日记
Rorschach's journal.

227
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,160
这毫无成果的夜晚，拜访的第一个人…
First visit of evening fruitless.

228
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,420
让我有些失望
Feel slightly depressed.

229
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,870
战争很快就会爆发了
Soon there will be war.

230
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:31,600
上百万的人会疾病和痛苦中死去
Millions will perish in sickness and misery.

231
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,300
为什么一个人的死还比这百万人重要？
Why does one death matter against so many?

232
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,840
因为当中有好人有坏人，而坏人必须被惩罚
Because there is good and evil, and evil must be punished.

233
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,850
即使面对世界末日…
Even in the face of armageddon...

234
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,810
在这点上我也不会妥协
... I will not compromise in this.

235
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,880
但是有那么多人的值得被报偿…
But there are so many deserving of retribution...

236
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,350
…而时间却那么少
... and so little time.

237
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,520
船长
MAN: Captain.

238
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,160
- 船长 - 瑞德里
- Captain. - Ridley.

239
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,320
瑞德里，你看到其他的生还者了吗？
Ridley, have you seen any other survivors?

240
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,520
没有，长官
No, sir.

241
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,160
船长，我的脚被些残骸卡住了
Captain, my foot is caught in some of the wreckage.

242
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,710
- 我要沉下去了 - 撑住
- It's pulling me under. - Hold on.

243
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,910
瑞德里
Ridley.

244
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,460
瑞德里
Ridley. Ridley.

245
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,390
不
No.

246
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,050
不
No.

247
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,690
更多血，更多血，更多血
VOICES [CHANTING]: More blood, more blood, more blood.

248
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,360
在近乎溺亡的迷乱中，我看见了它
MARINER: Delirious from nearly drowning, I saw it.

249
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,910
黑货船
The Black Freighter.

250
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,510
这驶向地狱的船的黑色船帆 正对着东印度群岛那片黄色的天空
The hell-bound ship's black sails against the yellow Indies sky.

251
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:25,020
我再次见识了火药、人类脑浆和战争的恶臭
I knew again the stench of powder and men's brains and war.

252
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,920
更多血，更多血，更多血
VOICES [CHANTING]: More blood, more blood, more blood.

253
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,060
更多血，更多血，更多血
More blood, more blood, more blood.

254
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,000
我身边的海浪是血红的…
MARINER: The waves about me were scarlet...

255
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:51,170
…它们冒着泡 在黑货船号驶过之后透着可怕的温暖
... foaming, horribly warm in the Freighter's wake.

256
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,510
绝望中，我将自己苦难的灵魂 祭献给全能的上帝…
In despair, I offered my weathered soul to almighty God...

257
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,170
…他的慈爱和他的审判
... his mercy and his judgment.

258
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,720
（黑货船传奇）

259
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,310
嗨，你觉得如何，小子？
MAN: Heh. What do you think, kid?

260
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,580
我们该向苏联发射核弹 剩下的让上帝去解决
We ought to nuke Russia and let God sort it out.

261
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,820
或者最低限度，让曼哈顿博士过去走一遭
Or at the very least, send Dr. Manhattan over for a visit.

262
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,480
知道我的意思吗？
You know what I'm saying?

263
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,560
我是说，我不是想做一个混球之类的 但的确是他们…
I mean, I ain't trying to be an asshole or anything, but they're the ones...

264

…先惹火我们的 这只是我的个人意见
...who are agitating us. Now this is just my opinion.

265
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,840
但我是一个卖报纸的，知道吗 我消息灵通
But I'm a news vendor, you know, so I am informed.

266
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,970
对，我知道，新边缘人报 呃，还没送到
Yeah, I know. The New Frontiersman. Well, it's not here yet.

267
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,970
如果你不在这瞎等的话 我会很感激的…
I'd appreciate if you didn't stand around waiting...

268
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,670
…因为我不知道什么时候会送到
...because I don't know when it's going to be here.

269
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,850
我想你刚刚才说你消息灵通的
I thought you said you was informed.

270
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,950
- 你打算买下这个吗？ - 不
- Are you gonna buy that? - No.

噢，上帝 明天再来看看，好吗？
Oh, Jesus. Just try again tomorrow, okay?

维特先生
MAN: Mr. Veidt...

273
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,430
迄今为止，你是守望者当中唯一两位…
...to date, you're one of only two Watchmen...

274
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:57,040
向大众公开身份的成员之一
...ever to reveal their true identity to the world...

275
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,010
第一位公开身份的是霍利斯·梅森 （一代夜枭，写过关于守望者的书，前文已提）
...the first being Hollis Mason.

276
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,170
将自己从一位超级英雄奥兹曼迪斯…
And you've certainly profited greatly by it...

277
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:07,620
转变成拥有价值过亿产业的商人 你一定从中获益良多
...turning your superhero alter ego, Ozymandias, into a billion-dollar industry:

278
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,850
玩具、午餐盒，基因工程
Toys, lunchboxes, genetic engineering.

我还听说一部相关的电影正在制作中
I understand there's a movie in the works.

- I'm not hearing a question, Mr. Roth. ROTH: I'm sorry. Do you think...

281
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,190
我贩卖着守望者们与邪恶争斗的事迹 他们会不会因此而憎恨我？
The Watchmen resent me for prostituting their struggle?

282
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:23,100
（时事杂志：超人们为和平而联手） 这是个合理的问题，是的，我曾这样想过
It's a fair question. Yes, it's crossed my mind...

283
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:26,300
某些过往的同僚们或许会这样看待我
...some of my old colleagues might see it that way...

284
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,460
但同时你也明白…
...just as you're clearly aware that biased journalism...

285
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,240
偏激的文章好卖
...sells more magazines.

The merchandising arm of Veidt Industries is funding our work with Dr. Manhattan.

287

We recently expanded our research facility in Antarctica...

288

...in the hope of developing cheap, renewable sources of energy...

289
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,180
并由此结束全球对于矿物燃料的依赖
...that we might eliminate the world's reliance on fossil fuels.

290
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,790
看，我们并不需要借助任何的政治学者…
Now, it doesn't take a political scientist...

291
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,360
都能理解，我们与苏联之间的冷战 并不是因为意识形态的不合
...to see that our Cold War with the Russians isn't ideological...

292
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:57,030
这是因为畏惧，畏惧于不能满足
...it's based upon fear. Fear of not having enough.

293
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,100
但如果我们能让能源永不枯竭…
But if we make resources infinite...

294
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,370
啊…
...ah...

295
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,640
那么战争将永远不会发生
...we make war obsolete.

296
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,310
我希望其他的守望者们能明白这点
I would hope the other Watchmen understand that...

297

不管他们现在身处何方
...wherever they may be.

感谢你们抽空到来
Thanks for your time.

你认为可能吗？
You think it's possible?

305
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,210
统计学来讲 一宗谋杀不代表对我们的捕杀
Statistically, one murder doesn't equal a trend.

306
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,310
罗夏是个反社会的人，丹
Rorschach's a sociopath, Dan.

307
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,320
笑匠也是，他简直就是个纳粹
And so was the Comedian. He was practically a Nazi.

308
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,180
你比任何人都清楚这点
You know that better than anyone.

我来这里并不是因为我怀念他
I'm not here because I miss him.

310
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,060
这件事让罗夏想到…
It's occurred to Rorschach...

311
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,200
就只有我们几个人知道彼此的身份
...that we're the only ones who know each other's identities.

312
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,790
而实际上，全世界的人都知道你的
Actually, the whole world knows yours.

313
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,030
所以我要提醒的第一个人是你
That's why I'm warning you first.

314

谢谢你，丹
Thank you, Dan...

315

The Soviets have 51,000 warheads stockpiled.

就算乔拦截了其中的99%…
Even if Jon stops 99 percent of them...

320
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,390

What if that's why someone wants us out of the way?

00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,850
你想请我和你共进晚餐…
You wanna ask me to go to dinner with you...

390
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,720
就像以前一样…
...like we used to...

391
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,290
但这次不行
...but you won't.

392
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,330
你明白我不能去的
You know I can't.

393
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,230
所以你会给丹电话…
So you'll call Dan...

394
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,870
这样很正常
...which is only natural.

395
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,800
你应该得到一位老朋友的慰籍
You deserve the comfort of an old friend.

396
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,640
丹·德雷伯格的桌位
LAURIE: Dan Dreiberg's table.

397
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,570
- 你知道他和H·J是… - 完全不知道
DAN: Did you know that he and H.J. Were...? I had no idea.

398
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,130
你还记得那个疯子吗？他怎么称呼自己来着？
You remember that crazy guy? What'd he call himself?

399
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,800
屠夫队长
Captain Carnage.

400
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,180
他总是假装是个超级恶棍 好让自己被暴打一顿
Used to pretend he was a supervillain just so he could get beat up?

401
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,750
是啊，他找我试过一次，我没理睬他
Yeah, he tried that on me once. I just walked away.

402
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,940
于是他大白天跟着我走了整条街…
He starts following me down the street in broad daylight...

403
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,920
一边走一边喊：“惩罚我吧！惩罚我吧！”
...yelling, "Punish me! Punish me!"

404
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,680
我回了一句：“不，滚开。”
I'm just saying, "No, get lost."

405
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:37,300
天啊，后来他怎么了？
God, whatever happened to him?

406
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,620
噢，嗯，后来他去惹罗夏了…
Oh. Um... He pulled that on Rorschach...

407
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,200
罗夏就把他扔下了电梯井
...and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.

408
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:51,070
哦，天啊，这就没趣了
Oh, my God. That's not even funny.

409
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,270
- 还是有点趣的 - 嗯
- It's a little funny. - Yep.

410
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,150
很庆幸我点了四腿鸡
WOMAN: I'm glad I ordered the four-legged chicken.

411
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,290
能再见到你真的很高兴
It's really good to see you again.

412
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,040
我也一样
It's great seeing you too.

413
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,380
我们为什么会那样做，丹？像那样子的变装
Why'd we do it, Dan? Dress up like that?

414
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,860
- 因为其他人不愿意做 - 是啊，你还记得我的衣服吗？
- No one else would. - Yeah, but do you remember my costume?

415
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:14,120
全身的束身橡胶，我说，那真糟糕
All that tight latex? I mean, it was awful.

416
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,270
啊，是啊，糟糕
Uh... Yeah, yeah, awful.

417
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,870
但我那时不想让妈妈失望
But didn't wanna disappoint Mother.

418
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,030
她想我成为像她一样的人，打击坏人
Wanted her little girl to be just like her and fight bad guys.

419
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:28,310
我想 “基恩法案”是发生在我们身上最好的事情了
I think the Keene Act was the best thing that ever happened to us.

420
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,750
其实，不论怎样我们都会活得久些的
Well, we'll live longer anyway.

421
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,580
怎么了？
What?

422
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,050
乔觉得，如果他不为此挺身而出的话…
Jon thinks, unless he can do something about it...

423
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,920
一场核战争就会爆发
...that there's gonna be nuclear war.

424
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,890
很快就会
Soon.

425
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:51,100
但我跟不上他的思维，我是说…
But I don't know what to think. I mean, it's all...

426
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:54,330
他的世界都是量子力学、平行实体之类的
...quantum mechanics and parallel realities with him.

427
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,270
我无法了解他眼中的宇宙
I never even know what universe he's actually seeing.

428
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,710
他和我越来越疏远了…
He just keeps getting further away from me.

429
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,080
和其他人也一样
Everyone.

430
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,850
我甚至不能确定他是否还在乎我…
I can't even tell if he actually cares about me anymore...

431
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,050
或者都只是他假装的
...or if he's just pretending.

432
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,690
如果他假装的话，那说明他还在乎
If he's pretending, it means he cares.

433
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,420
等等，我给你开门
Hold on, I'll get the door.

434
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,560
谢谢，丹
Thanks, Dan.

435
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,960
- 坐好了？ - 嗯
- Got it? - Yeah.

436
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,370
你总是带着官方陪同人员吃晚餐的吗？
You always get a government escort to dinner?

437
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,140
他们是要确定我不会做任何 让这个国家最强大的武器伤心的事
They're making sure I don't do anything to upset the country's most powerful weapon.

438
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,150
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

439
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,220
我约你出来吃饭，叙旧，说说笑…
I invite you out to dinner to catch up and have a few laughs...

440
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:49,960
但看起来我们大家最近都过得不怎样
...but there don't seem to be many laughs around these days.

441
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:53,930
还能期待些什么呢？笑匠都死了
What do you expect? The Comedian's dead.

442
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,540

我以为你已经习惯这种旅行方式了
Thought you'd be used to traveling that way by now.

449
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,370
还没，我讨厌乔传送我
Well, I'm not. I hate it when Jon teleports me.

450
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,420
那也比经济舱好的多
Well, it beats flying coach.

451
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,780
来点玛格丽塔？
Margarita?

妈，现在是下午2点
Mother, it's 2:00 in the afternoon.

00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,360
嗯
Mm.

454
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,330
还记得那个一直给我写信的家伙吗？
Remember that guy that writes me letters?

455
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,000
他给我寄来了一件大礼物 这在提华纳（墨西哥）就像圣经一样
He sent me an item of memorabilia. It's a Tijuana bible.

456
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:14,330
这本8页的色情小漫画，是30、40年代出版的 （漫画名：丝鬼，是以丝鬼一代为主角的色情漫画 丝鬼一代居然很喜欢，可见罗夏说她像妓女没错）
This little eight-page porno comic they did in the '30s and '40s.

457
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:18,530
- 他给你寄来了这个？ - 是啊，这东西很值钱，就像古董
- He sent you this? - Sure. They're very valuable, like antiques.

458
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,040
妈，这东西太恶心了
Mother, this is gross.

459
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,480
我觉得这样挺讨人喜欢啊
I think it's kind of flattering.

460
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,910
为什么你生气的时候总是用这种语气说话
Why do you always call me Mother when you're mad?

461
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:31,350
我知道你为什么来，我还能认字，知道吗？
I know why you're here. I can still read, you know.

462
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,350

我想，他终于让人发笑了
Finally got his punchline, I guess.

465
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,030
- 可怜的艾迪 - 可怜？他那样对你还可怜？
- Poor Eddie. - Poor Eddie? After what he did to you?

466
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,260
噢，劳丽，你还年轻
Oh, Laurie, you're still young.

你不了解
You don't know.

世事无常
Things change.

发生了什么也是40年前的事了
What happened happened 40 years ago.

470
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,950
我已经67岁
I'm 67 years old.

471
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:04,320
每一天，眼前的未来都在慢慢变暗
Every day, the future looks a little bit darker.

472
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,320
但是过去…
But the past...

473
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,820
即使最肮脏的过去…
...even the grimy parts of it...

474
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,990
却在逐渐发亮
...keep on getting brighter.

I've got spots in my eyes.

别这样，艾迪
Stop it, Eddie.

- Little place on 21 st. - Sounds good.

Oh, go ahead. I'll be there in five.

艾迪
Eddie.

483
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:13,480
你在这干什么？你知道我在换衣服
What the hell are you doing here? You knew I was changing.

484
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,250
我当然知道
Sure I did.

485
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,490
来吧，宝贝
Come on, baby.

486
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,920
我知道你需要什么
I know what you need.

487
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:25,160
你把衣服设计成这样，肯定有原因的
You gotta have some kind of reason for dressing in an outfit like this.

488
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,640
我说不要，艾迪
I said no, Eddie.

489
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:33,180
- 不要就是要 - 不要就是不要
- No spelled Y-E-S. - No spelled N-O.

490
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,780
- 别这样 - 来吧，宝贝
- All right? - Come on, sweetheart.

这就是你想要的？
This what you like?

494
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:36,200
- 这样能让你更迷人？ - 什么？
- This what makes you hot? - What?

495

世事总是令人难以接受，甜心
Things are tough all over, cupcake.

496

不论好人坏人，雨水都一样会落在他们头上
It rains on the just and the unjust alike.

497
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:58,160
笑匠却是有些亦正亦邪
The Comedian was a little bit of both.

498
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:03,000
而他认为他会是那个笑到最后的人
And he always thought he'd get the last laugh.

499
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,600
全知的主啊，你最了解我们内心的秘密
MAN: Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts.

500
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:10,540
请用你那慈爱的耳，聆听我们的祷告…
Shut not thy merciful ears to our prayers...

501
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:15,310
宽恕我们吧，至圣之主，全能之主…
...but spare us, Lord most holy, O God most mighty...

502
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,540
噢，神圣而仁慈的主
...O holy and merciful savior.

503
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,950
你那最可畏惧的永恒审判
Thou most worthy judge eternal.

504
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,450
在我们生命的最后时刻，请不要让痛苦降临
Suffer us not at our last hour for any...

506
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,840
烟花，不是开玩笑吧
EDDIE: Fireworks. You gotta be kidding me.

507
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:59,750
我还以为这该死的国家已经受够了烟火
You know, you'd think this goddamn country had had enough fireworks.

508
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,250
知道吗，我想如果我们在越南输了…
You know, if we'd lost here in Vietnam...

509
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:08,380
那我们就会被逼疯的，说的是我们国家
...I think it might have driven us crazy. You know, as a country.

510
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,860
但我们赢了，多亏了你
But we didn't, thanks to you.

511
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,770
你的话有酸楚
You sound bitter.

512
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,600
我？酸楚？
Me? Bitter?

513
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:21,830
去，不，我还以为说的很愉快
Fuck, no. I think it's hilarious.

514
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,010
噢，我的上帝
Oh, Jesus Christ.

515

- 艾迪先生 - 这他妈不是我要的
- Mr. Eddie? - Just what I fucking needed.

516
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:38,410
战争结束了，我们必须谈谈这个孩子的事情
The war is over now. We must talk about this baby.

517
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:42,720
没什么可谈的，我要离开这里了
There's nothing to talk about. See, I'm leaving.

518
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:44,230
我会把你忘掉的…
I'm gonna forget about you...

519
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,230
连同你这令人讨厌、湿热、一无是处的国家
...and your horrible, sweaty, little piece-of-shit country.

520
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,960
给我滚开
Get the fuck out of here.

521
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,570
- 不 - 给我滚开
- No. - Get the fuck out of here.

522
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,100
你会铭记的
You will remember.

523
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:58,600
你会铭记我和我的国家…
You will remember me and my country...

524
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,100
永远铭记！
...forever!

525
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,580
我的脸！
My face!

526
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:08,950
布莱克，不！
Blake. Don't.

527
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,050
布莱克！
Blake!

528
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:20,420
她怀着孩子…
She was pregnant...

529
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,430
但你却枪杀了她
...and you gunned her down.

530
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,860
没错
That's right...

531
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,970
知道吗？你看着我干的
...and you know what? You watched me.

532
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,130
你当时完全可以把我的枪变成蒸汽 把子弹熔化…
You could have turned the gun to steam, the bullets to mercury...

533
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:33,900
把那酒瓶变成该死的雪花片 但你没有这么做，不是吗？
...the bottle into goddamn snowflakes, but you didn't, did you?

534
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:38,680
你从来都不关心人类的死活
You really don't give a damn about human beings.

535
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:42,680
你把自己放得越来越高远了，博士
You're drifting out of touch, doc.

536
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,450
愿上帝救助我们
God help us all.

537
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,760
医务兵！
Medic!

538
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,760
至圣至仁之主啊
MAN: Most holy and merciful savior.

539
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:05,610
他成长而后辞世，如同花开花谢
He cometh up and is cut down, like a flower.

540
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,980
我们的生命中充满着生离死别
In the midst of life, we are in death.

541
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:14,450
这时我们可以寻求救助 但当我的主，你远离我们时呢？
Of whom may we seek succor, but of thee, O Lord?

542
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,920
欢迎，我们会长话短说
Welcome. We'll be starting shortly.

543
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:24,190
但是还差一个人
We're waiting for one more.

544
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:38,310
我说过，这里你不是唯一精心打扮过的人
I told you, you wouldn't be the only one dressed up.

545
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,340
欢迎你，博士
Welcome, doctor.

546
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,410
现在可以开始了
Now we can start.

547
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:47,420
感谢你们的到来 请看看这张标记了罪案高发区的地图
Thank you for coming. Acquaint yourselves with this map of high-crime areas.

548
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:48,700
（苏联称曼哈顿博士为“帝国主义者的武器”）

549
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:49,910
这话是狗屎
This is all bullshit.

550
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,090
对于一个称自己为笑匠的人 我无法区分你开玩笑和认真的时候
For a guy who calls himself the Comedian, I can never tell when you're joking.

551
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,660
守望者，就是一个笑话
Watchmen. That's the real joke.

552
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:01,630
15年前这样做毫无用处 现在也不会好到哪去…
It didn't work 15 years ago, and it ain't gonna work now...

553
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,930
因为你们只是想玩些牛仔和印第安人的游戏
...because you wanna play cowboys and Indians.

554
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,470
或许我们应该说好开会时不能喝酒
Maybe we should agree on no drinking at meetings.

555
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:12,000
罗夏和我联手之后，黑帮问题已经有了进展
Rorschach and I have made headway on the gang problem by working together.

556
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:16,510
这么多人一起行动，就像搞当众表演一样 我可不想趟这浑水
A group this size seems like a publicity stunt. I'm not in it for the ink.

557
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,480
我们还能做得更多
ADRIAN: We can do so much more.

558
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:20,850
我们可以挽救世界…
We can save this world...

559
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:25,620
- 如果能有正确的领导的话 - 是啊
...with the right leadership. - Yeah.

560
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:29,760
那就是你喽？是吗，小奥？
And that'd be you, right, Ozzy?

561
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:32,690
我说，去他的，你是地球上最聪明的人
I mean, hell, you're the smartest man on the planet.

562
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,530
不需要天才也能看得出这世界有问题
It doesn't take a genius to see the world has problems.

563
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:39,560
但你需要一屋子的蠢蛋 让他们相信只有你能解决问题
But it takes a room of morons to think they're small enough for you to handle.

564
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:41,230
你们这帮人
You people.

565
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:44,860
你们听说死神进城了，就一起抱佛脚了
You hear Moloch's back in town, get your panties all in a bunch.

566
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,880
- 你觉得抓住他有意义？ - 伸张正义有意义！
- You think catching him matters? - Justice matters.

567
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,280
伸张正义
Justice.

568
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,910
正义就要伸张到我们头上来了
Justice is coming to all of us.

569
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:55,550
不管我们他妈的做什么
No matter what the fuck we do.

570
00:49:56,290 --> 00:50:00,220
你知道，自从人类出现以来 他们就开始不断地自相残杀
You know, mankind's been trying to kill each other off since the beginning of time.

571
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:05,230
现在我们终于发现了能彻底终结这个问题的力量
Now we finally have the power to finish the job.

572
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:09,090
当那些核弹开始飞舞，什么东西都没意义了 我们都会变成焦土
Ain't nothing gonna matter once those nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.

573
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,260
而后这位奥兹曼迪斯…
Then Ozymandias here...

574
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:17,540
将会成为废墟里最聪明的人
...will be the smartest man on the cinder.

575
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:28,510
全能的主啊…
MAN: For as much as it hath pleased...

576
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:33,650
你已带走了我们这位别离兄弟的灵魂…
...almighty God to take onto himself the soul of our dear departed brother...

577
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:39,120
让我们把他埋藏吧
...let us therefore commit his body to the ground.

578
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:42,760
土归土，尘归尘
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes...

579
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:49,610
（警察说：让他们来做吧）

580
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:12,790
守望者！警察！保护人民的警察！
Watchmen! Police! Police to protect the people!

581
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:21,360
注意，市民们，我们正在维持秩序
DAN: Attention, citizens. We are trying to maintain order.

582
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:25,980
你们必须在警员罢工结束之前留在室内
You must clear the streets until the police strike is over.

583
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:29,310
如果你们能… 请不要使用暴力
If you could... Please, there's no need for violence.

584
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,380
在警员罢工结束之前 我们是来恢复社会秩序的
We are trying to retain order on the streets until the police strike is over.

585
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,750
请在你们受伤之前，爬回你们的窝里去
Crawl back in your holes before you get hurt.

586
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,080
- 我有橡胶子弹 - 我们有权这么做！
- I got rubber bullets. MAN 1: I want my rights!

587
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,890
- 你们不能代表法律！ - 我们要正常警察！
- You are not the law! MAN 2: We want regular cops!

588
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,320
不需要义警！
No more vigilantes!

589
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:47,060
我儿子就是个警察，你他妈的混蛋
My son's a police officer, you fucking faggots!

590
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:51,460
该死的，好吧，这就是你的要求？
Goddamn it. All right. That's how you wanna do it?

591
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:04,880
请不要使用暴力
There's no need for violence.

592
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:08,180
去你的！去你的！
Fuck you. Fuck you!

593
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:16,150
噢，这事情不好办了
Oh, this is getting heavy.

594
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,990
他妈的，我爱死在国内干活了，丹
Goddamn, I love working on American soil, Dan.

595
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,590
在伍德沃德和伯恩斯坦事件后就没那么爽快过了 （此二人为华盛顿邮报记者 正是他们跟踪报道水门事件使得尼克松辞职）
Ain't had this much fun since Woodward and Bernstein.

596
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,390
这样的秩序我们能维持多久？
How long can we keep this up?

597
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,150
国会正在拟定些东西 针对我们这些法外蒙面英雄的
Congress is pushing through some new bill that's gonna outlaw masks.

598
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:53,590
我们的日子不多了
Our days are numbered.

599
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:58,030
但到那之前，就像你总是说的： “我们是社会的唯一保障”
Until then, it's like you always say: We're society's only protection.

600
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,760
- 保障什么？ - 你说笑呢吧？保障他们不被自己伤害
- From what? - Are you kidding me? From themselves.

601
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,140
- 他妈的混蛋 - 不，笑匠，等等！
- Son of a bitch. DAN: No, Comedian, wait!

602
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,580
把你的臭手拿开
Get your stinking hands off me.

603
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:13,220
我们这是怎么了
What the hell happened to us?

604
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,850
大众的美国梦怎么了？
What happened to the American dream?

605
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:23,530
他们的美国梦怎么了？
What happened to the American dream?

606
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,820
成为现实了啊
It came true!

607
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,020
你看到的就是美国梦
You're looking at it.

608
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:04,740
（帐户已过期）

609
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,570
（金字塔跨国公司）

610
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:14,530
（报纸：苏联不会容忍 美国在阿富汗问题上的冒险行为的）

611
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,510
（在你身后）

612
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:31,960
埃德加·威廉·雅各比
Edgar William Jacobi.

613
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,960
又称埃德加·威廉·沃恩，也就是“死神”
Also known as Edgar William Vaughn. Also known as Moloch.

614
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,260
我不知道你说什么
What are you talking about?

615
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,630
我只是一个退休的商人
I'm a retired businessman...

616
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:49,770
再说谎看看，死神，我会扭断你另一只手指
Lie again, Moloch, I break another finger.

617
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,970
我的时代过去了
I did my time.

618
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,940
我不再是死神了
I'm not Moloch anymore.

619
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:59,980
- 你想从我这里知道什么？ - 听说你参加了笑匠的葬礼，原因呢？
- What do you want from me? - Heard you attended Blake's funeral. Why?

620
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:03,610
我只是觉得我应该…
I just felt I should...

621
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:07,690
向笑匠表示尊敬
...pay my respects to the Comedian.

622
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:14,890
- 你怎么知道他是笑匠？ - 他闯进了我的房子，一周前
- How'd you know he was the Comedian? - He broke in here. A week ago.

623
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:17,400
他脱下了自己的面具
He had his mask off.

624
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:21,360
- 他喝醉了 - 拜访敌人？几十年的敌人？
- He was drunk. - Enemies. For decades.

625
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:24,570
- 他凭什么拜访你？ - 我不知道
- Why should he visit you? - I don't know.

626
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:27,680
我在房里睡觉时醒了，他就在我面前了
I woke up in my bedroom and there he was.

627
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:29,810
他看起来很伤心
He was upset.

628
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:31,910
他在哭
He was crying.

629
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:34,710
哭？笑匠哭？
Crying? The Comedian?

630
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:37,880
他在说胡话，我一句都听不懂
EDGAR: He was babbling, not making any sense.

631
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:41,050
我都尿裤子了
I was pissing in my pants.

632
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:43,520
我以为他想杀了我
I thought he was gonna kill me.

633
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:45,960
他说了什么？
RORSCHACH: What did he say?

634
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,930
这是个玩笑
It's a joke.

635
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:52,230
全都是个他妈的玩笑
It's all a fucking joke.

636
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:56,670
知道吗？我以为我了解
You know, I thought I knew how it was.

637
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,870
我以为我了解这世界
I thought I knew how the world was.

638
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:03,670
我做过些坏事
I've done some bad things.

639
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:07,940
我对女人做过坏事，我枪杀过孩子
I did bad things to women. I shot kids.

640
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,380
你知道的，在越南
In 'Nam, you know.

641
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,390
但那他妈是战争啊
But that was fucking war.

642
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,690
但是这次…
This...

643
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:18,020
我从没有做过这样的事
I never done anything like this.

644
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,630
天，我正在…
God, here I am...

645
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,890
哭诉心事…
...spilling my guts...

646
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:27,860
对象是我最大的敌人之一
...to one of my archenemies.

647
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,370
但事实是…
But the truth is...

648
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:37,570
对我来说你是最像朋友的人了 那老话怎么说的来着？
...you're the closest thing to a friend I got. What the fuck does that say?

649
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:43,680
该死的
Shit.

650
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:46,880
你的名字…
And your name...

651
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,580
你的名字也在那名单上…
...your name was on the list...

652
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:54,090
还有珍妮，不管她他妈姓什么
...along with Janey, you know, whatever the fuck her name is.

653
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:56,700
曼哈顿的前女友
Manhattan's old girl.

654
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:03,070
妈妈，原谅我
Mother, forgive me.

655
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,900
然后他就走了
EDGAR: And then he left.

656
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:11,510
我向天发誓我根本不知道他在说什么
I swear I don't know what the hell he was talking about.

657
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,220
有趣的故事
Funny story.

658
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:23,020
听起来难以置信
Sounds unbelievable.

659
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:25,730
可能是真的
Probably true.

660
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,590
就这样？
So that's it?

661
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:32,900
- 我清白了？ - 你？
- I'm clean? - You?

662
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:35,440
清白？
Clean?

663
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,470
苦杏仁苷片 （据说能治疗癌症）
Amygdalin.

664
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:44,340
这种劣质药品是从杏果核里提炼的
This phony medication made from apricot pits.

665
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,750
- 是不合法的 - 别这样
- It's illegal. - Come on.

666
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,950
请别没收这个
Please don't confiscate that.

667
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:55,590
我试过所有的方法了
I'm trying anything.

668
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:58,550
我有癌症
I have cancer.

669
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:00,890
哪种癌？
What kind of cancer?

670
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,830
最后痊愈的那种吗？
You know the kind you eventually get better from?

671
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:09,730
不是那种
That ain't the kind I got.

672
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:16,940
罗夏日记，10月16日
Rorschach's journal. October 16th.

673
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:19,950
想尝尝吗？50块，我给你口爆
Want some of this? Fifty bucks, I'll suck your cock.

674
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:22,920
- 回想着死神说的故事 - 来吧
- Thought about Moloch's story. - Come on.

675
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:25,020
可能全是谎话
Could all be lies.

676
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:29,490
一个在他蹲大牢的几年里想出来的复仇大计
A revenge scheme planned during his years behind bars.

677
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:34,760
去你的，我一个星期赚的钱比你一年都多 你他妈的同性恋
Fuck you. I make more in a week than you make in a year, you fucking homo.

678
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:36,520
如果这是真的…
But if it's true...

679
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,970
有什么东西能使笑匠害怕？
... what could have possibly scared the Comedian...

680
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:41,000
甚至让他在死神面前哭鼻子？ （墙上：尼克松说，再给我四年！）
... enough to cry in front of Moloch?

681
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,400
他到底看到了什么？
What was it he saw?

682
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:46,840
还有他提到的那个名单
And that list he mentioned.

683
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:54,420
艾德华·布莱克，笑匠
Edward Blake. The Comedian.

684
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,990
1918年出生
Born 1918.

685
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:59,180
在雨中被埋葬
Buried in the rain.

686
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,220
被谋杀
Murdered.

687
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:05,420
这就是我们的报应吗？连朋友都没有？
Is that what happens to us? No time for friends?

688
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,530
只有我们的敌人前来献花
Only our enemies leave roses.

689
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:12,740
充满暴力的人生为暴力终结
Violent lives ending violently.

690
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:19,770
布莱克早就明白，野蛮是人类的天性
Blake understood. Humans are savage in nature.

691
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:22,640
不管你怎样的掩饰…
No matter how much you try to dress it up...

692
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:24,940
伪装…
... to disguise it...

693
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:28,240
布莱克早已看过了社会的真实面貌
... Blake saw society's true face.

694
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:33,050
于是决定去模仿它，模仿这个笑话
Chose to be a parody of it. A joke.

695
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,890
我听过一个笑话
I heard joke once.

696
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:39,860
说一个男人去看医生，说他很沮丧
Man goes to doctor, says he's depressed.

697
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:43,900
人生看起来很无情和残酷
Life seems harsh and cruel.

698
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:47,940
说他在这个充满威胁的世界上觉得很孤独
Says he feels all alone in threatening world.

699
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:50,900
医生说疗法很简单
Doctor says treatment is simple.

700
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:55,750
“伟大的小丑帕格里亚齐来了 去看他的表演吧
"The great clown Pagliacci is in town. Go see him.

701
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:57,900
那样能让你振作起来的”
That should pick you up. "

702
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:01,350
那男人突然大哭
Man bursts into tears.

703
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,850
“但是医生”他说，“我就是帕格里亚齐”
"But doctor," he says. "I am Pagliacci."

704
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:09,590
不错的笑话
Good joke.

705
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:11,760
听的人都笑了
Everybody laugh.

706
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:14,090
接着就是军鼓声
Roll on snare drum.

707
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,090
谢幕
Curtains.

708
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,840
- 嘿，伯尼 - 啊？
HOLLIS: Hey, Bernie. BERNIE: Yeah?

709
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,100
能给我来本《时代》杂志吗？
HOLLIS: Can I get a Time magazine from you there?

710
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:24,400
- 当然 - 这现在得要多少钱了？
BERNIE: Sure. - How much you want for it now?

711
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:25,840
你的话，两块
For you, 2 bucks.

712
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,600
两块，涨价了，哈？
Two bucks. Going up, huh?

713
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:31,250
给你，谢了
There you go. Thanks.

714
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:33,040
嘿，我喜欢你的书
Hey, I like your book.

715
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,980
嘿，谢谢，伯尼，谢谢你这么说
Hey, thanks, Bernie. I appreciate it.

716
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:32,340
当我醒来，我发现自己在一个阴凉的滩头上
MARINER: When I awoke, I found myself upon a dismal beachhead...

717
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:33,870
还有我的船员
... with my men.

718
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,380
我的船员的残骸
Pieces of my men.

719
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:46,620
我能为她做的仅有这些了…
It was all I could do for her...

720
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:50,120
虽然她承载着我穿越了血海
... though she had borne me through seas of blood.

721
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:54,660
她湿冷的拥抱已让我摆脱葬身大海的命运
Her damp embrace had prevented me from drifting beyond reach.

722
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:59,700
而这小小的慰籍却是我仅能做到的
Yet this small comfort was all I could offer.

723
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:11,640
前面躺着我的一名船员
One of my crew lay ahead.

724
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:14,810
鸟儿们在蚕食他的思想和记忆
Birds were eating his thoughts and memories.

725
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:16,250
滚开，滚！
Away. Yah!

726
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:18,010
滚！快滚开
Yah! Get away.

727
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:23,660
在地狱，至少海鸥们是满足的
In hell, at least the gulls are contented.

728
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,330
对我而言，我祈求它们当时就叼走我的眼睛
For my part, I begged that they should take my eyes.

729
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:32,630
这样我的余生才能从这骇人的景象中解脱
Thus sparing me future horrors.

730
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,540
你要在几点出席采访？
What time do you have to be at your interview?

731
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:40,340
别担心这个
JON: Don't worry.

732
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:43,470
我们有的是时间
We've got plenty of time.

733
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,720
舔你的手指好像在舔电池
Your finger's like licking a battery.

734
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,810
天啊，乔，住手，你这是在干吗？
God, Jon, stop. What are you doing?

735
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,310
请不要生气
Please don't be upset.

736
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:21,140
我一直以为你喜欢这样
I always thought you liked this.

737
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,720
不！
LAURIE: No.

738
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:27,190
我不喜欢…不
I don't... No.

739
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,860
我不要这样
I don't want that.

740
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:34,290
我已经不知道该怎么让你兴奋起来了
I don't know what stimulates you anymore.

741
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:40,060
听着，我明白你在试着…
Look, I know you were just trying...

742
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:44,340
我们在床上的时候你还在工作？
Are you working in here while we're in bed together?

743
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:47,940
我和阿德里安的工作正处于重要的阶段
My work with Adrian is at a critical stage right now.

744
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:51,580
- 我觉得没有必要为了… - 为了什么？
- I didn't think it was necessary to... - To what?

745
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:55,280
为了什么？ 为了告诉我你的哪个分身在和可怜的我作爱？
To what? To tell me which one of you is giving me a pity fuck?

746
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,860
当时我的注意力全在你这边
My attention was completely focused on you.

747
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:09,730
如果你觉得我对你的态度不好…
If you think there's a problem with my attitude...

748
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,130
我已经准备好和你讨论这点了
...I am prepared to discuss it.

749
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:17,640
你明白，这世上除了人类 所有的事物都能完美地相处融合
You know how everything in this world fits together except people.

750
01:05:17,810 --> 01:05:22,270
我对你来说是什么？另一个难解的谜题吗？
What am I to you? Another puzzle to be solved?

751
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:26,140
让你的人后退，我要把反应器传送到卡纳克了
Have your men stand back. I'm teleporting the reactor to Karnak now.

752
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:29,920
你是我和这个世界的唯一纽带
You're my only remaining link to the world.

753
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:40,290
我不想再背负这个责任了
I don't want that responsibility anymore.

754
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:43,010
（南极洲）

755
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:48,300
他归你了
He's all yours.

756
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:56,710
别担心，乔，她会回心转意的
ADRIAN: Don't worry, Jon. She'll be back.

757
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:00,380
不，她不会了
No, she won't.

758
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:19,030
他有很多种称谓：英雄、武器…
MAN [ON TV]: He's been called many things: Hero, weapon...

759
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:22,000
我们国防的关键…
... linchpin of our national security...

760
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:26,700
核战爆发的唯一障碍，或者能毁灭世界的人
... deterrent to nuclear war, or a man to end worlds.

761
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,600
今夜稍晚，曼哈顿博士…
Later tonight, Dr. Manhattan...

762
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:34,740
会在一场史无前例的采访中 回答我和大家的问题
... will answer my questions and yours in an exclusive interview...

763
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:39,790
将由维特公司毫无广告地为您送上
... brought to you commercial-free by Veidt Enterprises.

764
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,900
谁啊？
Who is it?

765
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:58,040
是我，劳丽
LAURIE: It's Laurie.

766
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:12,180
抱歉，我刚装了新门锁
Sorry. I just had this new lock installed.

767
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,820
我没其他地方可去
I didn't know where else to go.

768
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:18,160
哦，没关系，进来吧
Oh, it's okay. Come in.

769
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,630
怎么了？
What's wrong?

770
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,570
我离开乔了
I left Jon.

771
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:32,570
噢，天啊
Oh, God.

772
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,770
我很遗憾
I'm so sorry.

773
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:37,780
我不知道我来这干什么，我只是…
I don't know why I'm here. I just...

774
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:41,780
我不认识其他人
I don't know anybody else.

775
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:45,920
我不认识除了超级英雄之外的任何人了
I don't know anybody except for goddamn superheroes.

776
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:48,150
没关系
That's okay.

777
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,590
你们大概只是吵嘴之类的
You probably just had an argument or something.

778
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,130
不是的，丹
No, Dan.

779
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:55,360
你不知道和他一起生活是什么样子
You don't know what it's been like living with him.

780
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:58,660
他看事物的方式，就好像…
The way he looks at things now, it's like he doesn't...

781
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,300
他已经忘了它们的本来面目
...remember what they are.

782
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,800
就像这个世界，这个真实的世界…
It's like this world, this real world...

783
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:07,770
在他眼中，只是一团烟雾
... to him, it's like walking through mist.

784
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:11,510
人们只是一团影子
And people are just shadows.

785
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,570
雾中的影子
Shadows in a fog.

786
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:20,050
天啊，事情怎么会变成一团乱麻
God, how did everything get so tangled up?

787
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:23,650
很抱歉，丹
I'm sorry, Dan.

788
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:27,390
这是第二次了，我又搅乱了你的夜晚
This is twice now I've ruined your evening.

789
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:30,820
别这么说，你来了我很高兴
Come on. I'm glad you came over.

790
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,530
我正打算去看霍利斯 我们每周都有一次啤酒聚会
I was just gonna see Hollis for our weekly beer session.

791
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,700
我们绝对欢迎你的加入
You're more than welcome to join.

792
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:41,170
实际上，我坚决要你加入
In fact, I insist.

793
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,480
好极了 曼哈顿博士已经到了但没人想要通知我
Terrific. Dr. Manhattan arrives and no one thinks to tell me.

794
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:18,550
- 他就这样… - 没时间化妆了
WOMAN: He just... - We don't have time for makeup.

795
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:21,010
这蓝光对摄影机来说太耀眼了
That blue is too light for television.

796
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:25,780
这样够暗了吗？
Is that dark enough?

797
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:30,480
对，够暗了
PRODUCER: Yeah, that's dark enough.

798
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:30,490
（辐射庇护所）
对，够暗了
PRODUCER: Yeah, that's dark enough.

799
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:30,660
（辐射庇护所）

800
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,480
他肩负着整个世界，他会退缩吗？不
BERNIE: The weight of the world's on him, but does he quit? No.
（辐射庇护所）

801
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,320
他肩负着整个世界，他会退缩吗？不
BERNIE: The weight of the world's on him, but does he quit? No.

802
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,760
卖报纸的总是能解决，他们就像…
News vendors always cope. They're the...

803
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:40,490
噢，天啊，他又来了，那个流浪者
Oh, God, here comes that homeless guy again.

804
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:43,740
我说过了，这个月的一期还没有到
I told you, this month's issue still hasn't arrived yet.

805
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:47,570
为什么你那么关心那些右派的破报纸？ 他们根本不关心这事
Why do you care about that right-wing rag? Those bastards don't give a damn.

806
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:51,230
慢着，他们送来了
Hold up. Here they come.

807
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:51,240
（新边缘人报： 荣耀如同雄鹰：有时它也需要蒙上脸）
慢着，他们送来了
Hold up. Here they come.

808
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:54,880
（新边缘人报： 荣耀如同雄鹰：有时它也需要蒙上脸）

809
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:57,540
- 西摩尔 - 伯尼，近来可好？
- Seymour. - Bernie, how's tricks?

810
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:58,750
不错，不错
BERNIE: Fine, fine.

811
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:02,220
看到我身后那个男人吗？ 这个星期他一直在跟踪我
See this guy behind me? Been bugging me all week.

812
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:09,330
或许我们该坐车来，这里治安不好
Maybe we should get a cab. These are bad neighborhoods.

813
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:13,130
管它呢，我正好心情坏
Yeah, well, I'm in a bad mood.

814
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,980
- 小妞 - 看看谁来了
MAN 1: Girl. MAN 2: What we got here?

815
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:31,020
这个是五角大楼开出的禁谈话题清单
Here's a list of Pentagon-approved no-go areas.

816
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:33,990
他们一定会问起阿富汗的，一笔带过就好…
Afghanistan will obviously come up, but just play it cool...

817
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:36,520
还有别被逼进死胡同
...and try not to get into any tight corners.

818
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:40,390
一位著名的核子物理学家 他在经过一场可怕的意外后…
- A renowned nuclear physicist, who, through a terrible accident...

819
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:46,330
得到了异常的天赋，能够随意改变物体的外形
...was gifted with extraordinary powers, capable of bending matter to his will.

820
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:50,770
今天，全世界都知道他的名字：曼哈顿博士
Today, the world knows him as Dr. Manhattan.

821
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:52,270
欢迎你
Welcome.

822
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,510
谢谢
JON: Thank you.

823
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,620
这就对了
MAN 3: That's right.

824
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,960
布雷克女士，你来问第一个问题
Ms. Black, you have the first question.

825
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:11,560
曼哈顿博士，你知道…
Dr. Manhattan, as you know...

826
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:14,420
“末日时钟”是用来象征性地…
...the Doomsday Clock is a symbolic clock face...

827
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:18,160
推断人类的灭绝时刻的
...analogizing humankind's proximity to extinction...

828
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:21,490
午夜代表着核战爆发的威胁
...midnight representing the threat of nuclear war.

829
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:24,830
而现在，它指向差4分钟到午夜的时刻
As of now, it stands at four minutes to midnight.

830
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,940
你同意我们人类即将灭绝了吗？
Would you agree that we're that close to annihilation?

831
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:31,520
我父亲是一个钟表匠
My father was a watchmaker.

832
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:36,690
在爱因斯坦发现时间是相对的之后 他不再接触钟表
He abandoned it when Einstein discovered that time is relative.

833
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,850
我只能同意，这仅仅是一个对于谍报人员…
I would only agree that a symbolic clock...

834
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:42,020
才有象征性意义的时钟
...is as nourishing to the intellect...

835
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:45,460
如同给溺水的人一张氧气的照片一样
...as a photograph of oxygen to a drowning man.

836
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,530
你的意思是完全没有危险？
So you're saying there is no danger.

837
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:53,700
就算是这世上没有核武器，危险一样存在
JON: Even in a world without nuclear weapons, there would still be danger.

838
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:01,550
你是否同意，是神…
MAN: And would you say, as so many claim...

839
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,480
当然他们也称你“神”…
...that you are, in fact, a god...

840
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:06,490
是神让你能够同时看到过去和未来？
...given you see the past and future simultaneously?

841
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,950
我只能看到我自己的过去…
I can only see my own past...

842
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:13,290
和我自己的未来，我并非无所不知
... my own future. I am not omniscient.

843
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:15,260
道格·罗斯，该你问了
KOPPEL: Doug Roth, your question?

844
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:18,160
说起你的过去，曼哈顿博士…
Speaking of your past, Dr. Manhattan...

845
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:21,100
你还记得一个叫沃利·维沃的男人吗？
...do you remember a man named Wally Weaver?

846
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:26,400
是的，我们在吉拉·弗莱茨研究基地共事过
Yes. We were both physicists together at the Gila Flats Research Base.

847
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:28,470
他死于癌症
He died of cancer.

848
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,610
- 他是一个好人 - 那么埃德加·雅各比呢？
- He was a good man. ROTH: How about Edgar Jacobi...

849
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:34,680
也就是被称作“死神”的超级恶棍
... also known as the supervillain Moloch?

850
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:39,750
你和他在60年代的战斗、冲突中相遇过几次
You encountered him several times in the '60s: Battles, conflicts.

851
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:42,420
你知道他也得了癌症吗？
Did you know that he has cancer as well?

852
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,590
我并未被告知
I wasn't told.

853
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,990
那么安东尼·兰道夫将军呢？
ROTH: And what about General Anthony Randolph?

854
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:50,600
他是你在为政府工作时的联系人
He was your handler when you first started working for the government.

855
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,020
也是癌症
Cancer.

856
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,860
你是说我导致了他们患病？
You're suggesting I was the cause.

857
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:58,260
就我来看，结论看起来十分明显
ROTH: From where I'm standing, it's starting to look pretty conclusive.

858
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,470
就算这些都是事实，它们之间也没有关联
JON: Even if that's the case, it's irrelevant.

859
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:03,440
一个活着的人类和患病的人类…
A live human body and a deceased human body...

860
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:05,700
拥有着同样的身体构成
... have the same number of particles.

861
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:10,350
从结构上说，二者没有区别
Structurally, there's no difference.

862
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:13,750
好了，请安静
All right. Let's settle down, please.

863
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:20,860
那么珍妮·斯莱特呢？
What about Janey Slater?

864
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:23,960
你觉得她有不同吗？
You think it makes a difference to her?

865
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:26,360
珍妮？
Janey?

866
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,260
你的前女友
ROTH: Your ex-girlfriend?

867
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:32,070
她也是一个物理学家，你们交往了11年
She was a physicist too. You saw each other for 11 years.

868
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:33,760
道格，一次问一个问题
Doug, one question at a time.

869
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:37,310
她也得了癌症，医生说她只有半年命
She has cancer as well. Doctors have given her six months.

870
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,310
我说的对吗？斯莱特女士
Isn't that right, Miss Slater?

871
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:56,630
你是我的全部，乔
You were the world to me, Jon.

872
01:13:57,230 --> 01:13:59,460
你是我的生命
You were my whole life.

873
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,000
还记得你说过多少次你爱我吗？
Do you remember how many times you said you loved me?

874
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:04,870
珍妮，这事我不知道
Janey, I wasn't told.

875
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:10,710
意外发生后我一直对你不离不弃 我把一切都给了你
I stuck by you after the accident. I gave you everything.

876
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:17,410
这就是你给我的回报吗？
This is how you repay me?

877
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:22,760
- 珍妮，没人告诉过我，我不知道这事 - 诅咒你，乔，愿上帝诅咒你
- Janey, I wasn't told. I didn't know. - Damn you, Jon. Goddamn you.

878
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,920
珍妮，等等
Janey, wait.

879
01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:28,760
够了，采访结束了，来人
- That's it. This interview is over. MAN: Get up there.

880
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:31,300
把相机都拿走，所有人后退
Get those cameras off. Everybody back off.

881
01:14:31,470 --> 01:14:35,160
所有人后退，我需要支援，别再烦他
Everybody back off. I need some backup here. Leave him alone.

882
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:41,430
请你们大家，都走开…
Please, if everyone would just go away...

883
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:44,510
别再烦我…
...and leave me alone...

884
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,080
你愿意发表评论吗？
Do you care to comment?

885
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:49,270
我说过，别烦我！
I said, leave me alone!

886
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:16,810
上帝
Jesus.

887
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:19,500
我们…
Us...

888
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:22,250
被打劫了
...getting mugged.

889
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:26,180
走吧
Let's go.

890
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:33,720
我在发抖
I'm shaking.

891
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:39,700
你知道吗？
You know what?

892
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:43,560
我心情好了，我会记住今晚的
I'm wiped. I'm just gonna call it a night.

893
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:46,970
噢，你真的不和我一起去霍利斯家…
Oh, are you sure you don't wanna come by Hollis' with me...

894
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:49,370
然后冷静一下吗？
...and shake off the adrenaline?

895
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:53,310
我想这样一晚就够一个英雄受的了
LAURIE: I think I've had enough hero stuff for one night.

896
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:56,820
你能听我诉苦帮了很大忙
It helped having you listen.

897
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,850
随时欢迎
DAN: Any time.

898
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:01,450
保重，丹
LAURIE: Take care, Dan.

899
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:04,560
这世道不太平
It's a rough world out there.

900
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:07,220
回见
DAN: Be seeing you.

901
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:14,900
我想到了家人…
MARINER: I thought of my family...

902
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,100
…我的妻子，我的女儿们
... my wife, my daughters.

903
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:20,260
她们毫无防备，毫无怀疑
Vulnerable, unsuspecting.

904
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:24,410
等待着我的归来 而等到的只有迎面而来的…
Awaiting my return, only to be met by damnation...

905
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,010
…无尽的诅咒
... bearing down upon them.

906
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:34,580
嘿！
Hey!

907
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:36,220
我在这儿！
Over here!

908
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:38,350
这儿！
Here!

909
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:45,600
瑞德里
Ridley.

910
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:03,250
船帆
A sail.

911
01:17:03,690 --> 01:17:06,180
瑞德里给我带来了一片船帆
Ridley had brought me a sail.

912
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:09,620
或许这可以带我回到戴维斯敦
Perhaps this could be my route back to Davidstown.

913
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:15,220
我爱的一切，我为之而活的一切 都仰仗着我的归来…
Everything I loved, everything I lived for, depended on my reaching home...

914
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,700
…仰仗着我能比那可怕的黑货船早到
... in advance of that terrible Freighter.

915
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,800
直到早晨，我依然有着不少麻烦
The morning sun found me no less troubled.

916
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,640
在更远的海岸上…
Further down the shore...

917
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:37,310
…我的一些船员因臭气而膨胀
... some of my crew had become inflated with gas.

918
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:39,190
啊！
Ugh!

919
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:48,350
我为自己的这个想法而颤抖 尝试着去赶走这令人厌恶的念头
I shuddered at my own idea, attempting to banish this repulsive notion.

920
01:17:55,770 --> 01:18:00,070
即便已死，他们依然努力履行他们的职责…
Even in death, they sought to fulfill their duty...

921
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,840
…去让我们的这艘船更有浮力
... making our vessel more buoyant.

922
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:06,340
而我会履行我那将他们带回家的职责
And I would do my duty to them in returning them home.

923
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:13,320
粗鲁地搅扰着我那些长眠的船员 并把他们放进我为之准备的尸床
Rudely jarring my men from eternal rest, and laying them in the bed I prepared...

924
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:17,950
当我的妻子和女儿们逝世后 我希望她们能被…
... I hoped my wife and daughters might be tucked in by gentler hands...

925
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:19,820
…更温柔的手安放好
... when their turn came.

926
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:39,540
我们会一起回家的，我的朋友
We shall get home together, my friend.

927
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,950
我等待着涨潮
I waited for the tide.

928
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:48,780
然后，坐上船，向东航行
Then, embarking, headed east.

929
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,950
东方，穿过黑夜海洋
East, across the night seas.

930
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:56,590
东方，乘在被虐杀的人的尸体上
East, borne on the bodies of murdered men.

931
01:18:57,530 --> 01:19:00,020
人的希望可以变成可怕的事情
Hope can be a horrible thing.

932
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,100
找寻早餐的海鸥伴随着黎明的到来
With the dawn came the gulls looking for breakfast.

933
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:10,400
瑞德里
Ridley.

934
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:14,630
滚开
Get out.

935
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:24,110
我才想起我自己没有吃东西
I was reminded that I, myself, had not eaten.

936
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:30,180
我知道这并不好吃，但这是我们仅有的
I know it is unappetizing, but it is all we have.

937
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:34,280
（黑货船传奇）

938
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,530
他走了
MAN: He's gone.

939
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:39,500
- 他走了 - 谁走了？
- He's gone! BERNIE: Who's gone?

940
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:41,730
- 曼哈顿博士 - 什么？你说什么？
- Dr. Manhattan. BERNIE: What? What'd you say?

941
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:45,170
曼哈顿博士走了，离开我们了
Dr. Manhattan's gone. He's left us.

942
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:47,860
什么？去哪儿了？
What? Gone where?

943
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:55,110
你比平时晚了
You're late.

944
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,380
啊，我知道 你不会相信刚才发生的事的
Ah, I know. I know. You won't believe what happened.

945
01:20:58,550 --> 01:21:01,350
曼哈顿博士在直播的电视节目中消失了
Dr. Manhattan just lost it on live TV.

946
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,220
等等，什么？
Wait, what?

947
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,730
刚才劳丽和我一起，她不知道这事
I was just with Laurie. She doesn't know.

948
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:15,130
她很快就会知道的，全世界也会知道的
HOLLIS: She's gonna know soon enough. The whole world will know.

949
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:18,030
我说过，别烦我！
I said, leave me alone!

950
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,080
我看着星空
JON: I am looking at the stars.

951
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:32,580
它们是那么遥远…
They're so far away...

952
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:35,680
它们的光芒要很久才能到我们这里…
... and their light takes so long to reach us...

953
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:42,620
而我们看到的只是他们过去的光影
... all we ever see of stars are their old photographs.

954
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:50,070
在1959年7月，我恋爱了
It is July, 1959, and I am in love.

955
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:52,570
照得不错
MAN: That's great.

956
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:54,370
- 你明天就能来取相片 - 好的
- You can pick it up tomorrow. - Okay.

957
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:56,270
- 75美分 - 好，谢谢你
- Seventy-five cents. - Okay, thank you.

958
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:57,470
谢谢
Thank you.

959
01:21:57,650 --> 01:22:01,840
天啊，乔，真希望他刚才能给我们时间准备 我一定照得很丑
Gosh, Jon, I wish he gave us a little notice. I'm sure I made a face.

960
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:07,010
噢，不会，我保证你一定很上镜
Oh, no, no. I'm sure that you'll look beautiful.

961
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:13,260
她的名字是珍妮·斯莱特
Her name is Janey Slater.

962
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:16,760
她是一个物理学家，和我一样
She is a physicist, like me.

963
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:19,800
我那时30岁
I am 30 years old.

964
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:28,440
我们是通过我一位大学同学 沃利·维勒，认识的
We were introduced by a good friend of mine from college, Wally Weaver.

965
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:35,170
那是在1981年2月12日
It is February 12th, 1981.

966
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:39,120
沃利死于癌症 死于他们现在说是我导致的癌症
Wally dies of cancer, of which they now say I am the cause.

967
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:59,500
那一晚，珍妮和我第一次做爱
That night, Janey and I make love for the first time.

968
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:10,340
一个月之后，那意外在等着我
A month from now, the accident awaits me.

969
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:21,320
噢，我一会儿就赶上你们 我好像把手表留在了里面
Oh, I'll catch up with you guys. I think I left my watch inside.

970
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,230
嘿，我们等等他吧
Hey. Let's just wait a second.

971
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:32,040
我穿过房间，到了本征力场发生器中心 我找到了我的手表
I cross the room to the Intrinsic Field Center. I find my watch.

972
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:39,910
当我走到门前时…
When I get to the door...

973
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:42,880
沃利脸色都白了
... Wally is turning white.

974
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:47,110
程序被锁死了，我们无法让计时器停下来
The program's locked in. We can't override the time lock.

975
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:50,420
我被吓坏了
I am terrified.

976
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:51,720
乔？
JANEY: Jon?

977
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,730
对不起，乔…
I'm sorry, Jon...

978
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:02,230
我不能眼睁睁看着…
...but I can't...

979
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:06,030
珍妮，别离开我！
Janey, don't leave me!

980
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:08,570
别离开我！
Don't leave me!

981
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:45,380
那是在1959年5月12日，我和珍妮相见的时候
It is May 12th, 1959, when I'm introduced to Janey.

982
01:24:45,810 --> 01:24:48,010
她给我买了杯啤酒…
She buys me a beer...

983
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:51,050
那是第一次有女人为我做这样的事
... the first time a woman has done this for me.

984
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:56,250
当她递给我那冰冷、溢满的酒杯时…
As she passes me the cold, perspiring glass...

985
01:24:56,890 --> 01:24:58,120
我们的手指相碰了
... our fingers touch.

986
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:13,170
好的，乔，干得不错
Yes, Jon, good.

987
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:18,840
现在的问题只是 按照正确的顺序重新组装这些零件
Now it's just a question of reassembling the components in the correct sequence.

988
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:23,780
我最后一次…
I feel fear...

989
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:27,150
感觉到了恐惧
... for the last time.

990
01:25:43,970 --> 01:25:46,410
他们举行了一次象征性的葬礼
A token funeral is held.

991
01:25:46,570 --> 01:25:48,740
没有尸体可以埋葬
There is nothing to bury.

992
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:51,500
珍妮把那张快照装裱了起来
Janey frames the snapshot.

993
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:54,840
那是我留下来的唯一一张照片
It's the only photograph of me anyone has.

994
01:25:56,150 --> 01:26:01,020
有人在墙外看到了一副人体循环系统
A circulatory system is seen by the perimeter fence.

995
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:02,890
几天后…
A few days later...

996
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:06,290
人们在走廊 看到了一具覆盖了部分肌肉的人体骨骼
... a partially muscled skeleton stands in a hallway...

997
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:10,290
在它消失之前，还尖叫了一阵
... and screams for a moment before vanishing.

998
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:37,680
噢，上帝
Oh, God.

999
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:39,380
乔？
Jon?

1000
01:26:40,430 --> 01:26:42,260
是你吗？
Is that you?

1001
01:26:42,930 --> 01:26:45,960
（NSB台晚间新闻） 全世界都震惊于今早发布的声明…
Nations around the world reeling from this morning's announcement...

1002
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:48,760
这可能会是当代历史上最重大的事件
...possibly the most significant event in recent history.

1003
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:53,000
我重复一次，超人存在着，而且他是美国人
We repeat, the superman exists, and he is American.

1004
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:01,970
他们叫我曼哈顿博士…
They call me Dr. Manhattan.

1005
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,250
他们解释说选这名字…
They explain the name has been chosen...

1006
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:10,650
是要让美国的敌人们联想到噩兆 （曼哈顿计划让美国在二战时率先造出原子弹）
... for the ominous associations it will raise in America's enemies.

1007
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:18,600
搞宣传的一位年轻人说我需要一个徽记
The marketing boys say I need a logo.

1008
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:29,770
如果我要有个徽记…
If I'm to have a symbol...

1009
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:34,370
就只能是我所敬仰的那个 （原子）
... it shall be one I respect.

1010
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:47,450
他们把我塑造成了华而不实…
They are shaping me into something gaudy...

1011
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:50,660
致命的东西
... something lethal.

1012
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:57,990
在1971年1月…
In January, 1971...

1013
01:27:58,170 --> 01:28:02,130
尼克松总统要我出面干涉越战…
... President Nixon asks me to intervene in Vietnam...

1014
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:05,070
一件他的前任不会要求我干的事
... something that his predecessors would not ask.

1015
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:09,210
一周之后，战火结束了
A week later, the conflict ends.

1016
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:13,820
其中一些越共士兵还向我个人投降
Some of the Vietcong forces wanna surrender to me personally.

1017
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:20,850
霍利斯·梅森 一位退休的变装英雄，写了本书
Hollis Mason, a retired costume hero, writes a book.

1018
01:28:21,030 --> 01:28:25,860
书里，他说我的到来，象征着超级英雄的黎明
In it, he calls my arrival the dawn of the superhero.

1019
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:29,430
我不确定我是否明白这句话的意思
I am not sure if I know what that means.

1020
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:49,010
你看，当时，我引用错了词
WALLY: You see, at the time, I was misquoted.

1021
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:52,350
我不应该说：“超人存在着，他是美国人”
I never said, "The superman exists and he is American."

1022
01:28:52,530 --> 01:28:58,490
我想说的是：“神存在着，他是美国人”
What I said was, "God exists, and he is American."

1023
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,470
如果觉得这种说辞让你感到了…
Now, if you begin to feel an intense...

1024
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:05,540
一种把你推向对个人狂热崇拜的信仰恐惧
...and crushing feeling of religious terror at the concept...

1025
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:08,000
别恐慌
...don't be alarmed.

1026
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:12,670
那说明你们的头脑依然清醒
That indicates only that you are still sane.

1027
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:18,280
那是1963年的圣诞节
It is Christmas, 1963.

1028
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:22,320
珍妮说她既害怕又担心
Janey tells me she is afraid, and worried.

1029
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:25,750
她说我现在就像一个神
She says I am like a god now.

1030
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:28,620
我告诉她神是不存在的
I tell her I don't think there is a God.

1031
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,420
如果神真的存在，我和他绝不一样
And if there is, I'm nothing like him.

1032
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,640
我告诉她我依然想拥有她…
I tell her I still want her...

1033
01:29:39,410 --> 01:29:41,400
永远想要拥有她
... and that I always will.

1034
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:49,140
在1970年9月4日，我向她说了谎
As I lie to her, it is September 4th, 1970.

1035
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:52,850
在变装英雄的聚会上
I am in a room full of people wearing disguises.

1036
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:58,590
一个很年轻的女孩对着我笑
A very young girl looks at me and smiles.

1037
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:02,450
她很美
She's beautiful.

1038
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:11,900
在每次的热吻后 她都在我唇上留下一个小小的温柔的吻…
After each long kiss, she plants a smaller, gentler one upon my lips...

1039
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:13,630
就像是一个签名
... like a signature.

1040
01:30:15,010 --> 01:30:18,170
珍妮指责我四处寻欢
Janey accuses me of chasing jailbait.

1041
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:23,950
她突然愤怒地哭泣，问我是不是因为她变老了
She bursts into angry tears, asking if it's because she's getting older.

1042
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:25,950
她说的对
It's true.

1043
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:31,050
她每天都在明显地老去
She's aging more noticeably every day...

1044
01:30:37,630 --> 01:30:40,460
而我却不会变化
... while I am standing still.

1045
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:44,060
我更喜欢这近乎静止的空间
I prefer the stillness here.

1046
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,130
我厌倦了地球
I am tired of Earth.

1047
01:30:47,310 --> 01:30:48,970
地球上的人
These people.

1048
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:53,240
我讨厌进入人类混乱的生活
I'm tired of being caught in the tangle of their lives.

1049
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:19,400
他们声称自己在努力打造天堂…
They claim their labors are to build a heaven...

1050
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:23,430
但他们的天堂仍充满着可怕的事
... yet their heaven is populated with horrors.

1051
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:26,570
或许世界不是创造出来的
Perhaps the world is not made.

1052
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:29,570
或许没有什么东西能够被创造
Perhaps nothing is made.

1053
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:33,980
就像没有调校的钟表
A clock without a craftsman.

1054
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:36,910
太晚了
It's too late.

1055
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,260
从来都是…
Always has been...

1056
01:31:39,890 --> 01:31:43,330
永远都是…太晚了
... always will be too late.

1057
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:48,450
而你不知道他会去哪里？
FORBES: And you have no idea where he would've gone.

1058
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:49,920
我怎么会知道？
LAURIE: How would I know?

1059
01:31:50,090 --> 01:31:52,820
大概他只是在世界的另一端研究那些分子
Probably on the other side of the world studying molecules.

1060
01:31:52,990 --> 01:31:55,520
我们的卫星已经对地球作了一次扫荡式搜索
FORBES: Our satellites have done a sweep of the planet.

1061
01:31:55,690 --> 01:31:57,990
哪里都没有他能量信号的迹象
There's no trace of his energy signature anywhere.

1062
01:31:58,160 --> 01:31:59,460
真的？
Really?

1063
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:03,030
朱庇特女士，今天你和曼哈顿博士吵架了吗？
Miss Jupiter, did you and Dr. Manhattan have a fight today?

1064
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,690
这他妈不关你的事
None of your fucking business.

1065
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:08,200
当你拿政府的薪水但却没干活的时候 就关我的事了
It is when you're on government payroll and you're not doing your job.

1066
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:12,840
你说的话就相当于直接叫我“妓女” 佛比斯探员
That's as close to the word "whore" as you're gonna get with me, Agent Forbes.

1067
01:32:20,990 --> 01:32:22,480
来根烟吗？
Smoke?

1068
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:25,250
向你致歉，朱庇特女士
My apologies, Miss Jupiter.

1069
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:28,790
你了解曼哈顿博士对于我国国防来说有多重要
You know how important Dr. Manhattan is to our national security.

1070
01:32:29,690 --> 01:32:31,630
你能想象到我们很关心你们
You can imagine our concern.

1071
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:33,320
我只能想象
I can only imagine.

1072
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:43,560
当那些核弹开始飞舞，什么东西都没意义了 我们都会变成焦土
EDDIE: Ain't nothing gonna matter once those nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.

1073
01:32:44,010 --> 01:32:46,570
而后这位奥兹曼迪斯…
Then Ozymandias here...

1074
01:32:47,010 --> 01:32:49,780
将会成为废墟里最聪明的人
...will be the smartest man on the cinder.

1075
01:33:07,970 --> 01:33:11,060
劳丽？劳丽·简？
EDDIE: Laurel? Laurel Jane?

1076
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,400
你是沙莉·朱庇特的女儿
You're Sally Jupiter's kid.

1077
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:17,540
你是笑匠，对吧？
You're the Comedian, right?

1078
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:19,210
你说那些话时很酷
You were pretty cool in there.

1079
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:23,740
知道吗？你妈妈，她去到哪都是个选美冠军
You know, your mom, she was one of the all-time champion beauties.

1080
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:29,250
你有她的眼睛，还有她那颗有趣的小胎记
You got her eyes, you know. You even have that same funny little mole.

1081
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:31,620
别用你的手碰她！
Take your hands off her.

1082
01:33:31,790 --> 01:33:33,880
嘿，宝贝，好久不见
Hey, doll. Long time no see.

1083
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:37,650
对我来说还不够久 上车
Not long enough in my book, Eddie. Get in the car.

1084
01:33:39,230 --> 01:33:41,220
你觉得沉沦的还不够彻底吗？
Are there no depths you won't sink to?

1085
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:45,230
上帝啊，我就不能和我的…
Jesus Christ, Sally. Can't a guy talk to his...

1086
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:47,630
老朋友的女儿说话？
...you know, old friend's daughter?

1087
01:33:47,810 --> 01:33:49,930
我说，你认为我是个什么样的人？
I mean, what the hell do you think I am?

1088
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:51,770
找到他了
MAN: We found him!

1089
01:33:54,810 --> 01:33:56,910
- 找到他了 - 在哪儿？
- We found him. FORBES: Where is he?

1090
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:01,650
火星
Mars.

1091
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:09,680
总统先生…
Mr. President...

1092
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:14,490
苏联军队已经把他们的坦克 开动到很接近阿富汗边界的地方
...the Soviets have moved their tanks just short of the Afghan border.

1093
01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:17,300
他们在测试我们…
They are testing us...

1094
01:34:17,470 --> 01:34:21,870
以求证是不是我们捏造了曼哈顿博士的失踪…
...to see if we manufactured Dr. Manhattan's disappearance...

1095
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:25,130
由此引诱他们出击
...to coax a move out of them.

1096
01:34:25,310 --> 01:34:29,270
如果他们意识到这不是假的 他们首先大概会发动空中袭击
GENERAL 1: If they realize it's not a hoax, they'll probably start with air strikes.

1097
01:34:29,450 --> 01:34:33,510
他们如果这样做了 就会在几天之内控制阿富汗全境
If they do, they'll have Afghanistan under control in a matter of days.

1098
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:38,620
那组核战争观察员已经把“末日时钟”…
A watchdog group of nuclear scientists has moved the Doomsday Clock...

1099
01:34:38,790 --> 01:34:41,020
拨到了差2分钟到午夜
...to two minutes until midnight.

1100
01:34:41,190 --> 01:34:44,360
把这鬼东西从屏幕上撤下来
NIXON: Get this shit off the screen.

1101
01:34:44,530 --> 01:34:47,560
这些混蛋们凭什么说末日临近了？
Who are these assholes to say when doomsday approaches?

1102
01:34:47,730 --> 01:34:50,200
应该由我说了算
I say when doomsday is approaching.

1103
01:34:55,870 --> 01:34:57,470
那么
Now, then.

1104
01:34:58,510 --> 01:35:01,000
华沙条约的其他成员国呢？
What about the rest of the Warsaw Pact countries?

1105
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:05,380
捷克斯洛伐克、波兰和东德 已经动员他们的部队
Czechoslovakia, Poland and East Germany have mobilized their forces.

1106
01:35:05,550 --> 01:35:08,710
但是还没有动作，他们只是在观望
But no movement yet. They're playing a wait-and-see.

1107
01:35:08,890 --> 01:35:10,510
让俄罗斯领头
Letting the Russians take the lead.

1108
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:18,060
果断地行动，亨利（亨利·基辛格，国务卿） 这才是我们现在需要的
Bold moves, Henry. That's what's needed right now.

1109
01:35:18,230 --> 01:35:20,990
不能让这些混蛋觉得我们很怯弱
We can't let these fuckers think we're weak.

1110
01:35:21,170 --> 01:35:25,430
是啊，他们一定怕“疯子尼克松”怕的要死
Yes. They must fear the madman Richard Nixon.

1111
01:35:30,510 --> 01:35:33,970
要多久我们才能准备好率先攻击？
How soon can we be ready for a preemptive strike?

1112
01:35:35,150 --> 01:35:36,170
两天之后
Two days.

1113
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:40,450
我们有54%的几率在苏军的导弹击中目标之前…
We have a 54 percent chance of wiping out the entire U.S.S. R...

1114
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:42,680
全歼他们
...before they get their missiles airborne.

1115
01:35:44,290 --> 01:35:45,880
那我们会损失什么？
What would our losses be?

1116
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:47,920
在保守地估算…
Assuming conservative projections...

1117
01:35:48,090 --> 01:35:51,460
我们能预先摧毁的苏军核弹头数量之后
...of how many Soviet warheads are destroyed beforehand...

1118
01:35:51,630 --> 01:35:53,490
我们的东海岸会被摧毁
...we'll lose all of the East Coast.

1119
01:35:53,930 --> 01:35:55,460
这将是…
The last gasp...

1120
01:35:56,330 --> 01:35:58,800
哈佛校园的最后喘息了
...of the Harvard establishment.

1121
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:02,500
让我们看看他们怎么走上绝路的
Let's see them think their way out of fission.

1122
01:36:02,670 --> 01:36:06,270
在预算了风向后，辐射云会飘往南方
With anticipated wind patterns, the fallout drift would head south.

1123
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:08,640
墨西哥会遭受最大的影响
Mexico would catch the worst of it.

1124
01:36:08,810 --> 01:36:10,910
绝大部分的农场带不会受到污染
Most of the farm belt might remain unaffected.

1125
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:12,780
不太坏…
Not so bad...

1126
01:36:13,590 --> 01:36:15,710
所有的可能都算到了
...all things considered.

1127
01:36:18,290 --> 01:36:20,120
总统先生…
GENERAL 2: Mr. President...

1128
01:36:20,290 --> 01:36:21,920
您打算怎么做？
...what would you like to do?

1129
01:36:30,270 --> 01:36:32,570
把国防等级提升到2级吧
Take us to DEFCON two.

1130
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:34,730
开始给导弹加燃料
Begin fueling the bombers.

1131
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:38,240
曼哈顿博士有两天时间回来
Dr. Manhattan has two days.

1132
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:40,470
两天之后…
After that...

1133
01:36:40,650 --> 01:36:44,270
人类的命运就掌握在比我更高层的人手里了
...humanity is in the hands of a higher authority than mine.

1134
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:47,850
让我们期待他站在我们这边吧
Let's just hope he's on our side.

1135
01:36:49,090 --> 01:36:51,180
- 肯定有办法接近他的 - 打搅了
FORBES: There must be a way to reach him. LAURIE: Excuse me.

1136
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:53,020
无线电广播、太空飞船
FORBES: Radio transmission, space shuttles...

1137
01:36:53,190 --> 01:36:54,420
- 请问 - 什么事？
LAURIE: Excuse me. FORBES: What?

1138
01:36:54,590 --> 01:36:56,890
我要去趟洗手间
LAURIE: I need to use the restroom.

1139
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,080
你还不明白吗？
Don't you understand?

1140
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:22,880
能把乔带回地球的人只有他自己
The only thing that can bring Jon back is Jon.

1141
01:37:23,050 --> 01:37:25,020
如果他想找到我，他会做到的
If he wants to find me, he will.

1142
01:37:25,190 --> 01:37:27,660
我受够了好像囚犯一样的生活
I've been a prisoner in my life long enough.

1143
01:37:28,030 --> 01:37:29,720
缺少曼哈顿博士…
MAN: Without Dr. Manhattan around...

1144
01:37:29,890 --> 01:37:32,800
来迫使苏联甘守和平，维特先生…
...to bully the Russians into peace, Mr. Veidt...

1145
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:37,370
人们将会需要依赖那些过时但实用的能源
...people are going to need good, old-fashioned energy to rely on.

1146
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:39,200
你能明白的
You can understand.

1147
01:37:39,370 --> 01:37:44,470
全世界不能突然放弃使用原油和核子能
The world can't just quit on oil and nuclear power cold turkey.

1148
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:46,870
你这样做会让经济在一夜之间崩溃的
You'll dismantle our entire economy overnight.

1149
01:37:47,050 --> 01:37:49,810
说的对，李，为什么要免费能源？
You're right, Lee. And why free energy?

1150
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:52,880
看，“免费”其实就是“社会主义”的代名词
Well, "free" is just another word for "socialist."

1151
01:37:53,050 --> 01:37:55,020
我们将被迫开展一项关于…
We might have to make a public inquiry...

1152
01:37:55,190 --> 01:37:58,450
你和某些老共产主义分子有否关联的公开调查
...into any past communist affiliations you might have had.

1153
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:01,720
拉科卡先生，各位…
ADRIAN: Mr. Lacocca, gentlemen...

1154
01:38:02,890 --> 01:38:05,120
作为企业的首脑们…
...I respect your position...

1155
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:09,200
我的的确确尊重你们的立场和以往的功绩
...and what you've accomplished as captains of industry. I do.

1156
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:12,090
你们想了解我的过去？嗯？
You wanna know my past? Hm?

1157
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:15,630
好吧，愉快之至
Okay. Happily.

1158
01:38:15,810 --> 01:38:19,270
众所周知，我的双亲在我17岁时同时过世了…
It's a matter of public record that by 17, both my parents were dead...

1159
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,280
留下了孤独的我
...leaving me alone.

1160
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:25,650
我猜你们会说，我总是很孤僻
I guess you could say I've always been alone.

1161
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:30,720
他们说我是这世上最聪明的人 但我时常觉得自己很愚蠢…
They say I'm the smartest man in the world, but the truth is I've often felt stupid...

1162
01:38:30,890 --> 01:38:34,380
因为我不懂得与其他人相处…
...at being unable to relate to anyone.

1163
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:37,960
与其他活着的人
Well, anyone living, that is.

1164
01:38:38,130 --> 01:38:40,100
唯一一位我认为和我有血亲的人…
The only person with whom I felt kinship...

1165
01:38:40,270 --> 01:38:43,390
在耶稣降世300年之前就死了
...died 300 years before the birth of Christ.

1166
01:38:43,570 --> 01:38:48,940
马其顿的亚历山大 或者你们熟知的：伟大的亚历山大大帝 （那位把疆土从希腊打到印度的马其顿国王）
Alexander of Macedonia, or Alexander the Great, as you know him.

1167
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:52,130
他对于世界大团结的瞩望…
His vision of a united world was...

1168
01:38:55,450 --> 01:38:57,140
其实，是史无前例的
Well, it was unprecedented.

1169
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:59,010
我希望…
I wanted...

1170
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:01,480
我必须要达到他的功绩…
...needed to match his accomplishments...

1171
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:04,850
所以我决定用这古训教谕现世
...so I resolved to apply antiquity's teachings to our world today.

1172
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:08,520
于是开始了我的征服之路
And so began my path to conquest.

1173
01:39:08,690 --> 01:39:11,920
不单只是征服人类…
Conquest not of men...

1174
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:14,930
连同那些侵扰人类的罪恶
...but of the evils that beset them.

1175
01:39:15,170 --> 01:39:20,070
矿物燃料、原油、核子能…
Fossil fuels, oil, nuclear power...

1176
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:23,070
如同毒品，而你们，还有那些国外投资者…
...are like a drug, and you, along with foreign interests...

1177
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:24,870
- 就是这些毒品的推销者 - 好了，听着
...are the pushers. - Now, listen.

1178
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:27,070
不
ADRIAN: No.

1179
01:39:29,410 --> 01:39:31,210
你们听着
You listen.

1180
01:39:32,450 --> 01:39:34,940
这世界会存活下来…
The world will survive...

1181
01:39:35,150 --> 01:39:38,590
并且值得拥有比你们所能提供的更好的东西
...and it deserves more than you've been able to provide.

1182
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:41,350
让我们直切主题，好吧？
So let's cut to it, shall we?

1183
01:39:41,630 --> 01:39:44,090
我比你们所有的公司加起来还有价值
I'm worth more than all of your corporations combined.

1184
01:39:44,260 --> 01:39:47,860
我可以收购并出售你们 这点你们可以在作决定时考虑进去
I could buy and sell you, something you should factor into your decision...

1185
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:54,340
或者选择把我们之间的不和公布于众
...should you choose to make our disagreement public.

1186
01:39:55,810 --> 01:39:58,240
我想你知道该怎么做了
I think you know the way out.

1187
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:01,710
失陪了
Gentlemen.

1188
01:40:04,220 --> 01:40:07,710
玩具公司的人想和你商讨 关于这版奥兹曼迪斯系列玩具中的新坏人造型
The toy people wanna talk to you about new villains for the Ozymandias line.

1189
01:40:07,890 --> 01:40:11,340
- 貌似老敌人都死光了 - 维特先生？
- Seems all the old villains are dead. - Mr. Veidt?

1190
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:15,080
- 我想我有些建议 - 维特先生？
- I think I have some ideas. - Mr. Veidt?

1191
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:18,060
我想我们起步就走错了
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

1192
01:40:57,070 --> 01:40:58,760
他嘴里有剧毒胶囊
He's got a poison capsule.

1193
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:03,900
不准吞下去，你这混蛋！ 谁派你来的？说！
Don't bite down, you son of a bitch. Who sent you? I want a name.

1194
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:05,170
给我说！
Give me a name!

1195
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:18,590
自杀胶囊
LAURIE: Suicide pill.

1196
01:41:19,690 --> 01:41:22,630
剧毒氰化物，入口既亡
Potassium cyanide. Guy was dead before he hit the ground.

1197
01:41:22,790 --> 01:41:24,630
谢谢，侯
WAITRESS: Thanks, hon.

1198
01:41:25,130 --> 01:41:27,150
罗夏说对了
Then Rorschach was right.

1199
01:41:27,330 --> 01:41:29,490
这不是个别人的单打独斗
This wasn't some Ione nut.

1200
01:41:29,670 --> 01:41:33,800
他们是有组织的，而且资金充足，装备精良
It's an organization: Well-funded, well-equipped.

1201
01:41:34,770 --> 01:41:36,710
但现在这时候谁会想要杀我们？
But who'd wanna kill us now?

1202
01:41:38,010 --> 01:41:41,140
我不知道，但是外面已经不安全了
I don't know, but it's not safe out here.

1203
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:48,650
有乔的消息吗？
So no word from Jon?

1204
01:41:49,620 --> 01:41:51,250
没有
No.

1205
01:41:51,620 --> 01:41:53,520
是这样
Well, listen...

1206
01:41:54,030 --> 01:41:55,720
为什么你不过来和我一起住呢？
...why don't you come stay with me?

1207
01:41:57,060 --> 01:42:00,050
不了，谢谢你的好意，但我不想去打扰你
Oh, no. That's sweet, but I wouldn't wanna impose.

1208
01:42:00,530 --> 01:42:03,900
哦，不，你就当帮我个忙好了
Oh, no. No. Think of it as doing me a favor.

1209
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:08,070
这样我就不用担心你一人在外了
I wouldn't have to worry about you being out there.

1210
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:12,700
好吧
Okay.

1211
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:21,220
罗夏日记，1985年10月21日
Rorschach's journal, October 21 st, 1985.

1212
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:25,480
在第43街和第3街交叉口，看见德雷伯格和朱庇特 吃完晚餐出来
On 43rd and 7th, saw Dreiberg and Jupiter leaving diner.

1213
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:28,820
我不戴面具他们就不认识我
They didn't know me without my mask.

1214
01:42:29,660 --> 01:42:31,320
难道是红杏出墙？
An affair?

1215
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:34,360
难道她想伤曼哈顿博士的心来报复他的离去？
Did she break Manhattan's heart to engineer his exile...

1216
01:42:34,530 --> 01:42:37,520
让德雷伯格有机可乘？
... to make room for Dreiberg?

1217
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:41,160
曼哈顿有没有一颗心来为她碎呢？
Does Manhattan even have a heart to break?

1218
01:42:42,410 --> 01:42:45,200
小巷阴冷而又荒凉
The alley was cold, deserted.

1219
01:42:45,380 --> 01:42:49,970
我的宝贝们静静地等着我
My things were where I left them, waiting for me.

1220
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:54,520
我的大衣，鞋子，干净的手套
My coat, my shoes, my spotless gloves.

1221
01:42:56,050 --> 01:42:57,990
还有我的面具
My face.

1222
01:42:58,220 --> 01:43:02,160
穿上他们，我就卸下了伪装
Putting them on, I abandoned my disguise...

1223
01:43:02,330 --> 01:43:04,450
变回真正的自己
... became myself.

1224
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:08,060
不再恐惧和软弱
Free from fear or weakness...

1225
01:43:08,230 --> 01:43:09,320
或有欲念
... or lust.

1226
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:12,770
小巷深处
Down alley...

1227
01:43:12,940 --> 01:43:14,800
女人呼救声
... heard woman scream.

1228
01:43:14,970 --> 01:43:18,970
奏响了城市夜曲的第一章
First bubbling note of city's evening chorus.

1229
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:20,940
是强奸？
Attempted rape.

1230
01:43:21,110 --> 01:43:22,270
抢劫？
Mugging.

1231
01:43:22,450 --> 01:43:23,910
或都是？
Both.

1232
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:27,110
那人转过身来
The man turned...

1233
01:43:27,290 --> 01:43:30,470
从他的眼神里我得到了满足
... and there was something rewarding in his eyes.

1234
01:43:31,470 --> 01:43:33,940
有时候夜晚对我很慷慨
Sometimes the night is generous to me.

1235
01:43:40,050 --> 01:43:44,380
去杀维特的是个当地人 身份不明，只知道他叫罗伊·切丝
Veidt's assassin was a local lowlife named Roy Chess.

1236
01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:47,710
在他的住处我找到了些线索
At his apartment, I found clues.

1237
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:51,980
貌似他在金字塔跨国公司工作
Seems he worked at Pyramid Transnational.

1238
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:54,720
我以前就见过这个标志
I've seen the logo before...

1239
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:57,190
在死神家里
... at Moloch's.

1240
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:30,390
今天有人想谋杀天下第一聪明人，死神
Someone tried to shoot the world's smartest man today, Moloch.

1241
01:44:31,330 --> 01:44:34,130
金字塔跨国公司的人
Guy worked for Pyramid Transnational.

1242
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:36,430
我觉得这应该不仅仅是送货服务吧
More than a just delivery service, I take it.

1243
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:40,540
我上次来的时候 见到同一个公司签发的抚恤金支票
Last time I was here, I saw a pension check written from the same company.

1244
01:44:40,710 --> 01:44:44,200
我觉得这是个幌子 有人想让别人都以为我们死了
I'm guessing it's a front set up by whoever wants us masks dead.

1245
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:47,970
别再撒谎了，死神 谁开的金字塔公司？
Now, no more lies, Moloch. Who runs Pyramid?

1246
01:44:52,850 --> 01:44:54,480
罗夏
FINE [O VER BULLHORN]: Rorschach.

1247
01:44:54,650 --> 01:44:57,020
警察，我们知道你们在里面
This is the police. We know you're in there.

1248
01:44:57,190 --> 01:44:59,050
不，不！
No. No!

1249
01:44:59,220 --> 01:45:02,350
如果有人和你在一起，请让他们安全地出来
If there's anybody in there with you, send them out unharmed.

1250
01:45:02,530 --> 01:45:05,460
不，不，不，不
No. No, no, no!

1251
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:10,030
我被陷害了，如此容易就上当了 我真是太蠢了，蠢到家了
Framed. Walked right into it. Stupid, stupid, stupid!

1252
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:11,830
永远，永远不要投降
Never, never surrender.

1253
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,000
好吧，我希望你已经准备好了，大英雄
All right. I hope you're ready, hero.

1254
01:45:15,170 --> 01:45:16,200
随时奉陪
When you are.

1255
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:39,920
一
One...

1256
01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:45,990
二
...two...

1257
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:51,070
三
...three.

1258
01:46:43,060 --> 01:46:44,820
加把劲
Come on.

1259
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:57,070
这个混蛋
MAN: Son of a bitch.

1260
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:00,440
- 天，这家伙臭死了 - 把他的面具拿掉
- Christ, he stinks. - Get that mask off him.

1261
01:47:00,610 --> 01:47:03,450
- 拿下了 - 不，不！
- I got it. - No. No!

1262
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:06,310
我的面具，把我面具还我
My face! Give me back my face!

1263
01:47:07,150 --> 01:47:09,780
蒙面孤胆英雄罗夏已被逮捕
The masked vigilante Rorschach was apprehended...

1264
01:47:09,950 --> 01:47:13,790
证实他是一位35岁的白人男性 名叫沃特·科瓦克斯
... and identified as Walter Kovacs, a 35-year-old white male.

1265
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:17,020
大家对沃特的情况不甚了解 不过他已因为涉嫌
Little's known about Kovacs, but he was charged with the murder...

1266
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:21,030
谋杀埃德加·雅各比而被收监 后者在纽约布朗克斯区的家中额头中枪而死
... of Edgar Jacobi, found shot in the head in his home in the Bronx.

1267
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:24,230
在艰难的抓捕行动中
Police officers were injured and Jacobi's home was set ablaze...

1268
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,960
多名警员受伤，雅各比的家也被大火烧毁
... during the violent course of the capture.

1269
01:47:30,780 --> 01:47:32,070
罗夏
MAN 1: Rorschach!

1270
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:35,970
我会像干你妈一样干死你
I'm gonna fuck you like I fucked your mother!

1271
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:45,560
罗夏，出来
MAN 2: Come on out, Rorschach!

1272
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:51,090
（头条：罗夏显露真面目） 我就知道这家伙是个疯子
BERNIE: I knew this guy was a kook.

1273
01:47:51,660 --> 01:47:53,060
但是罗夏…
But Rorschach...

1274
01:47:53,230 --> 01:47:56,000
通常我对这类事情都有一种直觉
Usually I got an intuition about these kind of things.

1275
01:47:56,170 --> 01:47:58,570
- 还以为这家伙块头会大些 - 如你所见，小鬼…
- Thought the dude would be bigger. - It goes to show you, kid...

1276
01:47:58,740 --> 01:48:00,570
- …总有想不到的 - 嘿，给我来份公报
...you never know. - Hey, let me get a Gazette.

1277
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:04,570
好，嘿，看到这个了吗？ 他原来是我的一个老主顾
Yeah. Hey, you see this? He was a customer of mine.

1278
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:07,710
- 经常来我这里 - 真的？
- Used to come here all the time. - No shit?

1279
01:48:09,580 --> 01:48:12,310
嘿，伯尼，有好消息吗？
Hey, Bernie. Any good news?

1280
01:48:22,090 --> 01:48:25,460
不管我们是谁，不管我们身处何方
MARINER: Whoever we are, wherever we reside...

1281
01:48:25,630 --> 01:48:28,460
我们依靠伤天害理的妄想而存活
... we exist on the whim of murderers.

1282
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:36,110
我几乎认不出我的老朋友瑞德里
I hardly recognized my old friend Ridley.

1283
01:48:36,270 --> 01:48:39,400
我无法迫使自己去对他说 这只是原来的他的…
I could not bring myself to tell him he was a horrible reflection...

1284
01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:41,480
…一副可怕的倒影
... of his former self.

1285
01:48:41,780 --> 01:48:46,310
我必须要在…在他变得更糟之前 带他回家
I really must get him home before... Before he gets any worse.

1286
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:48,610
在他死之前
Before he succumbs.

1287
01:48:49,090 --> 01:48:54,580
我在以前每天一起喝小酒的时候听说过 饮用咸水是不会死人的
I've heard that on less than a pint daily, a man might survive drinking saltwater.

1288
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:56,090
船长?
RIDLEY: Captain?

1289
01:48:56,260 --> 01:48:57,730
你在干什么，船长？
What are you doing, captain?

1290
01:49:00,270 --> 01:49:03,100
我要去戴维斯敦，干这个
I'm headed for Davidstown. That's what.

1291
01:49:03,570 --> 01:49:06,260
我要去提醒大家
I need to warn everyone.

1292
01:49:08,740 --> 01:49:12,270
你以为你会在黑货船号之前赶到戴维斯敦？
You think you'll reach Davidstown in advance of the Black Freighter?

1293
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:16,810
与世隔绝已经让你疯狂了，船长 疯了，的确
Isolation has made you mad, captain. Mad, indeed.

1294
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:19,150
但我们必须一试
But we must try.

1295
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:20,510
你是个傻瓜
You are a fool.

1296
01:49:20,690 --> 01:49:23,210
只有你在黑货船的袭击中幸存
You alone survived the Freighter's attack.

1297
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:27,590
命运眷顾了你，而你却唾弃了她
Fortune has smiled upon you, and you spit in its face.

1298
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:33,130
快掉转你那悲惨的船 远远地离开吧，有多远走多远
Turn your wretched craft around and go far away, as far away as you can.

1299
01:49:35,230 --> 01:49:39,170
不，不，我的家人，我要保护她们
No. No, my family. I must protect them.

1300
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:42,240
黑货船已经到那里了
The Black Freighter is already there.

1301
01:49:43,010 --> 01:49:44,630
你的妻子，死了
Your wife, dead.

1302
01:49:44,810 --> 01:49:47,440
- 你的孩子，死了 - 给我闭嘴
- Your children, dead. - Shut your mouth.

1303
01:49:47,610 --> 01:49:51,950
你辜负了你的家人 如同你辜负了你的船员
You have failed your family, like you have failed your crew.

1304
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:16,760
你会和他们一样的死去 你白白地放弃了自己的生命
You'll end up dead like them. You give your life in vain.

1305
01:50:16,940 --> 01:50:19,140
我献出我的生命以高尚
I give my life in nobility.

1306
01:50:22,010 --> 01:50:25,070
就算我的努力失败了 我将会以在天堂中…
Even if I fail in my attempt, I take solace in the fact that I will see...

1307
01:50:25,250 --> 01:50:26,810
…见到我的家人而得到慰籍
...my family again in heaven.

1308
01:50:26,990 --> 01:50:28,320
天堂？
Heaven?

1309
01:50:28,490 --> 01:50:30,550
噢，根本没什么天堂，船长
Oh, there is no heaven, captain.

1310
01:50:31,090 --> 01:50:33,180
相信我吧，长官
Believe me, sir.

1311
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:35,520
有的话我现在就该知道了
I would know by now.

1312
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:43,900
沃特·科瓦克斯
MAN: Walter Kovacs.

1313
01:50:44,070 --> 01:50:46,760
这是你的真名？沃特？
Is that your name? Walter?

1314
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:51,000
我来跟你说说你现况，沃特
Well, let me explain your situation here, Walter.

1315
01:50:51,180 --> 01:50:52,730
你要是和我合作的话
You cooperate with me...

1316
01:50:52,910 --> 01:50:57,410
说不定我能说服他们相信你需要医疗救治
...and I may be able to convince them that you should be treated medically.

1317
01:50:57,580 --> 01:51:01,140
去医院，那绝对会对你有好处
In a hospital. I believe that would be good for you.

1318
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:07,350
不过当局想把你和普通犯人关在一起
But the authorities wanna put you with the general population.

1319
01:51:08,230 --> 01:51:11,290
- 监狱就是监狱 - 的确如此
- Prison's a prison. - Uh-huh. Yes.

1320
01:51:11,900 --> 01:51:15,330
不过差别就是，在那里
But the difference is, down there...

1321
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:17,270
你会被别人生吞活剥的
...you'd be eaten alive.

1322
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:22,470
那里很多人的被捕都和你有关，沃特
You're responsible for a lot of them being in prison here, Walter.

1323
01:51:25,540 --> 01:51:27,000
告诉我你看见了什么
Tell me what you see.

1324
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:27,010
（罗夏测试，通过抽象图像反应被测者的潜意识
不过他对这测试可以说是行家，否则怎么叫罗夏）
告诉我你看见了什么
Tell me what you see.

1325
01:51:27,010 --> 01:51:32,170
（罗夏测试，通过抽象图像反应被测者的潜意识
不过他对这测试可以说是行家，否则怎么叫罗夏）

1326
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:33,840
一只漂亮的蝴蝶
A pretty butterfly.

1327
01:51:37,660 --> 01:51:39,490
现在呢？现在看见了什么？
What about now? What do you see here?

1328
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:45,650
母亲？
Mom?

1329
01:51:46,030 --> 01:51:47,400
他伤害你了吗？
Is he hurting you?

1330
01:51:47,570 --> 01:51:50,430
你他妈的竟然还有个孩子 我家里也有一个
You got a fucking kid in here. I get that at home.

1331
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:54,130
小混蛋，我当初就应该流产
Bastard. I should have had that abortion.

1332
01:52:03,780 --> 01:52:05,720
一些漂亮的花儿
Some nice flowers.

1333
01:52:11,420 --> 01:52:13,080
我听说他老妈是个妓女
BO Y 1: I heard this guy's mom's a whore.

1334
01:52:15,390 --> 01:52:18,120
她是不是把性病传染给你了？
Did you catch any diseases from her?

1335
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:23,100
妓女的儿子？等下，听我说
Huh? Whoreson. Listen to me, retard.

1336
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:27,630
你觉得，给她一块钱，她会不会给我口交？
BO Y 2: Hey, you think she'd suck my dick for a dollar?

1337
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:47,380
云彩
Clouds.

1338
01:52:52,330 --> 01:52:55,060
跟我谈谈罗夏好吗？沃特？
Tell me about Rorschach. Will you do that, Walter?

1339
01:52:55,230 --> 01:52:58,760
你一直叫我沃特，我讨厌你
You keep calling me Walter. I don't like you.

1340
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:04,040
你讨厌我，那好吧，为什么？
You don't like me. All right, why is that, exactly?

1341
01:53:04,210 --> 01:53:05,570
你太肥了
You're fat.

1342
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:09,310
还富有，自由
Wealthy. Liberal sensibilities.

1343
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:11,470
你所谓的怜悯
What you call compassion.

1344
01:53:11,650 --> 01:53:13,950
就是想保护和理解那些犯罪
Wanting to protect and understand the guilty.

1345
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:18,020
这是个腐败的社会，等待它的康复
This rotting society, what it calls rehabilitation.

1346
01:53:18,190 --> 01:53:19,660
无异于妥协
Nothing short of compromise.

1347
01:53:19,820 --> 01:53:22,380
想让你正常也是一种妥协吗？
Is it a compromise to want to make you well?

1348
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:26,790
这儿有些人犯的罪比我严重得多
There are other men in here with behavior more extreme than mine, doctor.

1349
01:53:27,470 --> 01:53:30,430
当然了，他们也没我那么出名，对吧？
Of course, they're not famous, are they?

1350
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:33,530
你想了解罗夏？
You wanna know about Rorschach?

1351
01:53:35,010 --> 01:53:36,770
我来跟你说说罗夏
I'll tell you about Rorschach.

1352
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:40,570
当一个人看过这个社会最阴暗面的时候
Once a man has seen society's black underbelly...

1353
01:53:40,750 --> 01:53:43,370
他就再不能回头了
...he can never turn his back on it.

1354
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:46,140
也不再需要像你们一样伪装
Never pretend, like you do...

1355
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:50,650
假装罪恶并不存在，不管是谁要求他那样做
...that it doesn't exist, no matter who orders him to look the other way.

1356
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:54,480
我们不会那样
We don't do this thing...

1357
01:53:54,660 --> 01:53:56,750
因为我们是正义的
...because it's permitted.

1358
01:53:57,400 --> 01:53:59,960
我们必须那么做
We do it because we have to.

1359
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:02,960
我们被自己强迫那么做
We do it because we're compelled.

1360
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:07,240
那时候我正在调查一项绑架案
I was investigating a kidnap case.

1361
01:54:08,970 --> 01:54:10,840
布莱尔·罗切
Blaire Roche.

1362
01:54:11,010 --> 01:54:14,440
一个6岁的女孩，当时我还年轻
Six-year-old girl. I was young then.

1363
01:54:15,310 --> 01:54:17,650
对罪犯比较手软
Too soft on criminals.

1364
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:20,210
不会杀掉他们
I let them live.

1365
01:54:21,490 --> 01:54:27,220
打断了一个人的手之后我得到了线索 来到了失踪女孩的位置
Broke a man's arm to get a tip. Led me to the missing girl's location.

1366
01:54:34,830 --> 01:54:37,270
我觉得女孩应该在这儿
I knew the girl was here...

1367
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:40,960
不过搜索之后，什么也没找到
... but when I searched the place, I saw nothing.

1368
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:44,270
然后我看到了她
And then I found her.

1369
01:55:33,620 --> 01:55:35,490
弗雷德
MAN: Fred.

1370
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:38,190
巴尼
Barney.

1371
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:41,090
谁给老爸叫两声听听？
Who's gonna bark for Daddy?

1372
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:49,800
犯人回来的时候，天已经黑了
It was dark when the murderer got back.

1373
01:55:51,540 --> 01:55:53,130
一片漆黑
As dark as it gets.

1374
01:56:31,780 --> 01:56:36,650
上帝，谁在外面？是谁？
Oh, God. Who's out there? Who is it?

1375
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:39,580
到底是谁？
Who is it?

1376
01:56:50,300 --> 01:56:53,740
什么？他妈的怎么回事？ 你他妈的是谁？
What? What the fuck? Who the fuck are you?

1377
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:58,400
你想怎么样？你弄死了我的狗！
What the fuck do you want? You killed my dogs, man!

1378
01:57:03,410 --> 01:57:07,940
你觉得我和那个女孩的死有关系？ 我发现了她而已
You think I had something to do with that girl? I found that.

1379
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:10,590
你有什么证据？这不算证据
What evidence have you got? That's nothing.

1380
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:21,290
好吧，我认罪
Okay. I confess.

1381
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:25,200
我绑架了她，杀了她
I kidnapped her. I killed her.

1382
01:57:25,970 --> 01:57:27,370
逮捕我吧
Arrest me.

1383
01:57:28,170 --> 01:57:29,900
怎么了？逮捕我吧！
What? Arrest me!

1384
01:57:31,510 --> 01:57:33,480
是我干的，我说是我干的
I did it! I said I did it!

1385
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:35,080
天哪！
Christ.

1386
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:39,550
听着，我这次麻烦大了伙计 送我进监狱吧，我宁愿进监狱
Look, I've got a problem, man. Fucking take me in. I need help.

1387
01:57:40,350 --> 01:57:47,090
别，别这样，别，送我进监狱吧
No, don't. Don't do that. Take me in. Don't! No!

1388
01:57:52,060 --> 01:57:55,560
人进监狱
Men get arrested.

1389
01:57:56,970 --> 01:57:58,990
狗只有死 （在罗夏眼里，这个人连狗都不如）
Dogs get put down.

1390
01:58:07,110 --> 01:58:09,270
我的手被震到麻痹
Tremors of impact shook my arm.

1391
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:13,010
温暖的血液溅到我脸上
Warm blood splashed my face.

1392
01:58:14,250 --> 01:58:18,350
不管那晚沃特·科瓦克斯还残留有任何影子 都随着那个女孩的死消失得无影无踪了
Whatever was left of Walter Kovacs died that night with that little girl.

1393
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:21,590
从那时起，就只剩下罗夏
From then on, there was only Rorschach.

1394
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:25,890
明白了？不是上帝要了那个女孩的命
See, doctor, God didn't kill that little girl.

1395
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:30,530
不是命运不让她活 也不是宿命让她葬身为狗食
Fate didn't butcher her and destiny didn't feed her to those dogs.

1396
01:58:31,700 --> 01:58:35,140
就算老天有眼看见那晚的悲剧 他也不介意
If God saw what any of us did that night, he didn't seem to mind.

1397
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:38,870
从那时起，我开始明白
From then on, I knew:

1398
01:58:40,210 --> 01:58:42,540
不是上帝令世界变成这个样子
God doesn't make the world this way.

1399
01:58:44,550 --> 01:58:46,040
是我们自己
We do.

1400
01:58:52,420 --> 01:58:54,790
我帮不到他
I can't help him.

1401
01:59:06,790 --> 01:59:08,580
嘿，罗夏
Hey, Rorschach.

1402
01:59:09,590 --> 01:59:11,580
嘿，你现在出名了是吧？
Hey, you're pretty famous, right?

1403
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:14,220
罗夏，我听说你妈是个妓女
MAN 1: Rorschach, I heard your mother was a whore.

1404
01:59:14,390 --> 01:59:17,950
你知道吗？其实我也挺出名的
Hey, you know what? I'm pretty famous too.

1405
01:59:18,130 --> 01:59:20,660
- 我说的对不对？ - 说得对
- Ain't that right? That's right. MAN 2: That's right.

1406
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:25,530
说不定我能帮你写本自传 你觉得怎么样？小子？
Maybe I can give you an autograph. What you say, big boy?

1407
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:44,310
看来你们没有明白 不是我被迫和你们关在这里
None of you seem to understand. I'm not locked in here with you.

1408
01:59:44,490 --> 01:59:46,580
够了，住手
OFFICER: All right, that's it!

1409
01:59:47,430 --> 01:59:49,860
是你们被迫和我关在一起
You're locked in here with me.

1410
02:01:08,610 --> 02:01:09,670
劳丽！
DAN: Laurie!

1411
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:12,210
糟了
Shit.

1412
02:01:13,210 --> 02:01:15,110
- 撑住 - 妈的
DAN: Hold on. - Fuck.

1413
02:01:18,380 --> 02:01:19,870
我来，让我来，我来
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1414
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:27,960
真抱歉，我想到处看看 结果不小心按错了按钮
I'm so sorry. I was snooping and must have hit the wrong button.

1415
02:01:28,130 --> 02:01:29,560
- 你受伤了吗？ - 没有
- Are you hurt? - No, no.

1416
02:01:29,730 --> 02:01:32,820
- 那就好 - 我没事，只是感觉很糟糕
- Okay. - I'm fine. I just feel so bad.

1417
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,990
没事，别担心
No, don't worry.

1418
02:01:35,170 --> 02:01:38,470
以前就发生过 77年的时候，笑匠就曾干过
It's happened before. Comedian did it back in '77.

1419
02:01:39,570 --> 02:01:41,400
不过阿基那时都逃过了这一劫
Archie survived that.

1420
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:43,170
阿基？
LAURIE: Archie?

1421
02:01:43,910 --> 02:01:47,370
呃，就是阿基米德的简称
Oh. Well, uh, short for Archimedes...

1422
02:01:47,550 --> 02:01:49,070
梅林的宠物猫头鹰 （有部关于亚瑟王的导师梅林大法师的动画 他有只会说话的猫头鹰叫阿基）
...Merlin's pet owl.

1423
02:01:50,180 --> 02:01:51,840
愚蠢的外号
Stupid nickname.

1424
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:55,650
你怎么买得起这些东西的？
LAURIE: How did you ever afford all this stuff, anyway?

1425
02:01:55,820 --> 02:02:01,350
我父亲之前从事银行业 死后给我留了一大笔遗产
Well, my dad was in corporate banking and left me a lot of money when he died...

1426
02:02:02,090 --> 02:02:05,430
一笔数目巨大的吓倒我的遗产 我是说，他以前
...which always surprised me. I mean, he was...

1427
02:02:06,100 --> 02:02:08,730
我觉得他以前对我打击犯罪的工作很失望
I think he was disappointed I went into crime fighting...

1428
02:02:08,900 --> 02:02:10,600
他觉得我应该继承他的事业
...instead of following him.

1429
02:02:11,370 --> 02:02:18,370
不过我应该是对鸟类 航天飞机和神话更感兴趣
Guess I was just more interested in birds and airplanes, mythology and...

1430
02:02:18,810 --> 02:02:22,800
而且，已经有很多人在做这些事 我就不会感觉这很荒谬
Plus, there were enough other guys doing this so that I didn't feel ridiculous.

1431
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:24,940
像霍利斯
Like Hollis.

1432
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:26,610
对
Yeah.

1433
02:02:27,390 --> 02:02:30,150
他是我心目中的英雄
Yeah, he was my hero.

1434
02:02:31,190 --> 02:02:34,590
我记得第一次见他的时候
Man, I remember the first time that I met him...

1435
02:02:35,490 --> 02:02:38,390
我就感觉我们是如此相像，你知道吗？
...I just felt so connected, you know?

1436
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:40,900
在一些重要的方面
To something that mattered.

1437
02:02:43,740 --> 02:02:46,400
有个秘密身份肯定感觉很不错吧？
Must be nice having a secret identity.

1438
02:02:47,070 --> 02:02:49,230
还有个任何人都不知道的秘密据点
A secret place that nobody knows about.

1439
02:02:49,410 --> 02:02:54,400
你可以随意进出，没人会对你进行安检
You can just come down here and hang out without anyone checking up on you.

1440
02:02:55,880 --> 02:02:58,210
没有人会监视你
Nobody watching you.

1441
02:03:01,550 --> 02:03:02,610
想试试吗？
Wanna try those on?

1442
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:15,060
我们试试吧
There we go.

1443
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:20,230
哇，这太酷了
Wow, these rock.

1444
02:03:23,070 --> 02:03:25,370
这能扩大光谱范围
They amplify the spectral range.

1445
02:03:25,540 --> 02:03:27,670
热成像
Thermal imaging.

1446
02:03:29,350 --> 02:03:31,340
黑暗中效果更好
They work even better in the dark.

1447
02:03:36,250 --> 02:03:38,020
你能看见我，对吧？
You can see me, right?

1448
02:03:40,190 --> 02:03:42,850
我什么都能看见
I can see everything.

1449
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:49,090
我记得，不管外面有多黑
I remember, no matter how black it got...

1450
02:03:49,430 --> 02:03:53,560
只要我戴上这镜片 一切又如同白天一样清楚
...whenever I looked through those goggles, everything was as clear as day.

1451
02:03:55,870 --> 02:03:58,210
这肯定也是乔眼中的世界了
This must be the way Jon sees the world.

1452
02:04:00,710 --> 02:04:03,550
我们吃饭吧，都快凉了
We should probably head up. Food's getting cold.

1453
02:04:03,780 --> 02:04:05,880
看完了记得把它放回去
Put those away when you're done.

1454
02:04:14,860 --> 02:04:17,190
苏联大使和联合国都没有发表任何
MAN [ON TV]: Soviet ambassador to the U.N. Had no comment...

1455
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:19,630
关于曼哈顿博士消失的评论
... when asked if Dr. Manhattan's disappearance...

1456
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:22,130
加速了苏联在阿富汗的侵略
... has fueled Soviet aggression in Afghanistan.

1457
02:04:22,300 --> 02:04:24,000
丹
Dan.

1458
02:04:24,740 --> 02:04:26,470
乔能看见很多东西
Jon sees a lot of things...

1459
02:04:28,870 --> 02:04:31,170
但他看不见我
...but he doesn't see me.

1460
02:04:38,320 --> 02:04:39,840
这个，嗯...
Well, uh...

1461
02:04:58,070 --> 02:04:59,630
哦
Oh.

1462
02:05:33,470 --> 02:05:34,800
抱歉
Sorry.

1463
02:05:36,810 --> 02:05:38,140
过来
Come here.

1464
02:05:44,080 --> 02:05:45,340
怎么了？
What's the matter?

1465
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:47,950
- 你能挪一下你的 - 好的
- Lf you could just move a little... - Okay.

1466
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:50,350
嗯，好
Yeah. There you go.

1467
02:05:56,860 --> 02:05:59,490
丹，怎么了？
Dan, what's wrong?

1468
02:06:01,170 --> 02:06:02,290
抱歉，我
Sorry, I...

1469
02:06:04,440 --> 02:06:06,670
对，我要走开一下
Yeah, I just need a couple minutes.

1470
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:10,770
哦，见鬼了
Oh, hell.

1471
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:14,380
没事的
It's okay.

1472
02:06:15,780 --> 02:06:20,220
可能我们发展太快了
Maybe we were just moving too fast.

1473
02:06:23,790 --> 02:06:26,420
我们有大把的时间
We've got all the time in the world.

1474
02:06:27,930 --> 02:06:29,920
慢慢来
We'll take it slow.

1475
02:06:43,910 --> 02:06:46,240
好久不见，罗夏
It's been a long time, Rorschach.

1476
02:06:46,910 --> 02:06:48,400
大块头
RORSCHACH: Big Figure.

1477
02:06:48,750 --> 02:06:50,580
这世界真小
Small world.

1478
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:53,410
我喜欢这样
I like that.

1479
02:06:54,190 --> 02:06:56,590
不过你得知道，冤家路窄
But you know, it is a small world in here.

1480
02:06:57,020 --> 02:06:59,790
我已经在这呆了多久了，李昂德？
And I've been in it for, how long now, Lloyd?

1481
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:02,090
大概15年了，大块头先生
LLO YD: Almost 15 years, Mr. Figure.

1482
02:07:02,430 --> 02:07:03,760
对
That's right.

1483
02:07:04,760 --> 02:07:08,250
自从你和你的同伙把我抓进来已经15年了
Fifteen years since you and that Owl fella put me away.

1484
02:07:11,270 --> 02:07:12,430
那么
So...

1485
02:07:12,940 --> 02:07:17,700
罗夏，你烫伤的那个人已经不行 随时都可能死掉
...Rorschach, that guy you burned is dying. Could go any minute.

1486
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:23,070
知道吗？我大概统计了一下 这里有50多号都是你抓进来的
You know, by my count, there are more than 50 people in here that you put away.

1487
02:07:23,250 --> 02:07:27,580
我和他们每个人都谈过了 大家都恨不得吃了你
I been talking to every one of them and they're all dying to get a piece of you.

1488
02:07:27,750 --> 02:07:31,050
这里将会爆炸！
This place is gonna explode!

1489
02:07:32,620 --> 02:07:35,290
你会被慢慢折磨死
Then, you die by inches.

1490
02:07:36,230 --> 02:07:37,890
离谱
Tall order.

1491
02:07:38,130 --> 02:07:40,620
我要把这家伙撕碎
I'm gonna tear this guy a new hole.

1492
02:07:41,300 --> 02:07:44,290
别激动，劳伦斯，快了
Relax, Lawrence. Soon.

1493
02:07:45,140 --> 02:07:46,470
走吧
Come on.

1494
02:09:20,370 --> 02:09:22,420
告诉你吧，朋友
MARINER: Know this, my friends.

1495
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:23,690
死神是湿滑的
Hades is wet.

1496
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:26,590
死神是孤独的
Hades is lonely.

1497
02:09:42,450 --> 02:09:46,220
在那一刻，我们认识了对方
And in that instant, we knew each other.

1498
02:10:22,630 --> 02:10:24,890
很抱歉，我的朋友
I'm sorry, my friend.

1499
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:48,020
我的木筏已经变得越发离奇古怪
My raft had grown increasingly grotesque...

1500
02:10:48,620 --> 02:10:51,650
直接反映着我自身的变化
... reflecting my own transformation.

1501
02:11:05,240 --> 02:11:09,300
漂流中，我最黑暗的想象 在我脑海中自由地涌现
Adrift, my darkest imaginings welled up unchecked...

1502
02:11:09,470 --> 02:11:12,600
如同黑墨水般从脑中溢向心中
... spilling from brain to heart like black ink...

1503
02:11:12,780 --> 02:11:15,210
无法抹除
... impossible to remove.

1504
02:11:24,060 --> 02:11:27,050
那艘船肯定早已到达戴维斯敦
The vessel had surely reached Davidstown already.

1505
02:11:27,890 --> 02:11:32,300
我想象着宁静的街道被黑货船号下来的恶魔 占据的景象
I pictured quiet streets overrun by the fiends from the Black Freighter.

1506
02:11:32,460 --> 02:11:35,690
我的妻子，我的孩子，大概已经死了
My wife, my children, most certainly dead.

1507
02:11:35,870 --> 02:11:37,860
我的船员，死了
My crew, dead.

1508
02:11:38,040 --> 02:11:41,700
我乘坐的这头野兽，死了
The beast I ride on, dead.

1509
02:11:50,650 --> 02:11:53,580
更多血，更多血，更多血
VOICES [CHANTING]: More blood, more blood, more blood.

1510
02:12:07,900 --> 02:12:09,230
爸爸？
GIRL: Father?

1511
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:11,870
这不可能，哦，上帝 这不可能
It can't be. Oh, Lord, it can't be.

1512
02:12:12,040 --> 02:12:15,270
爸爸，救救我们，求求你
Father, help us. Please.

1513
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:16,460
等等
MARINER: Wait.

1514
02:12:18,180 --> 02:12:19,200
我就来
I'm coming.

1515
02:12:19,980 --> 02:12:21,310
快来，亲爱的
Hurry, my dear.

1516
02:12:22,080 --> 02:12:24,980
等等，除了她们谁都行
Wait. Anyone but them.

1517
02:12:25,150 --> 02:12:26,780
谁都行
Anyone.

1518
02:12:27,050 --> 02:12:28,610
谁都行
Anyone.

1519
02:12:32,890 --> 02:12:35,120
我吞下了太多的海水
I'd swallowed too much seawater.

1520
02:12:35,290 --> 02:12:38,130
我吞下了太多的恐怖
I'd swallowed too much horror.

1521
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,860
上天对我下了诅咒
God has damned me.

1522
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,630
上天对我们都下了诅咒
God has damned us all.

1523
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:52,740
的确，生活就是地狱 而暴死是我们唯一的解脱
Truly, life is hell, and death's rough hand our only deliverance.

1524
02:12:53,480 --> 02:12:55,600
我不能再忍受了
I can endure no more.

1525
02:12:55,780 --> 02:12:59,680
我急切地想要追随我的家人
I want to join my family desperately.

1526
02:13:07,490 --> 02:13:09,320
嘿
MAN: Yo, man.

1527
02:13:09,860 --> 02:13:11,690
在看什么呢？
What you reading?

1528
02:13:12,900 --> 02:13:14,390
没什么，老兄
Nothing, man.

1529
02:13:15,770 --> 02:13:18,330
- 没什么，哈？ - 嘿，嘿，你别碰这个小鬼
- Nothing, huh? - Hey, hey! You leave that kid alone!

1530
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:20,200
闭嘴，老家伙
Shut up, old man!

1531
02:13:29,010 --> 02:13:31,710
你在看的是漫画书？ 你怎么了，弱智吗？
You're reading a comic book? What are you, retarded?

1532
02:13:39,020 --> 02:13:42,050
嘿，你要到哪儿去，小弱智？
Aw, hey, where you going, short bus?

1533
02:13:52,340 --> 02:13:53,670
丹?
Dan?

1534
02:14:00,510 --> 02:14:02,170
你没事吧?
Is everything all right?

1535
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:07,450
我厌倦了担惊受怕
I'm tired of being afraid.

1536
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:10,890
害怕战争
Afraid of war...

1537
02:14:11,690 --> 02:14:15,250
害怕面具杀手
...afraid of the mask killer...

1538
02:14:16,860 --> 02:14:20,060
害怕这该死的衣服
...and afraid of this goddamn suit...

1539
02:14:20,230 --> 02:14:22,200
以及我是多么需要这一切
...and how much I need it.

1540
02:14:23,030 --> 02:14:24,700
我也是
Me too.

1541
02:14:26,200 --> 02:14:27,500
那就让他们见鬼去吧
So to hell with it.

1542
02:14:28,370 --> 02:14:29,700
我们开阿基米德出去吧
Let's take Archie out.

1543
02:14:35,650 --> 02:14:36,770
你是认真的吗？
You're serious.

1544
02:14:36,950 --> 02:14:39,470
我以前也是面具杀手，没忘吧？
I used to be a masked avenger too, remember?

1545
02:14:39,650 --> 02:14:42,880
我以前经常半夜3点出去，做一些傻事
I'm used to going out at 3 in the morning and doing something stupid.

1546
02:15:44,620 --> 02:15:46,710
紧急火情，所有单位，听候指示
MAN [O VER RADIO]: Rapid burner. Be advised, all units.

1547
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:49,440
梧兰特大街和第五大街处失火
Tenement fire at 5th and Grand. Rapid burner.

1548
02:15:49,620 --> 02:15:50,950
走吧
Let's go.

1549
02:15:55,730 --> 02:15:58,090
- 我看到了 - 好的，抓紧了
LAURIE: I can see it. DAN: All right, hold on.

1550
02:16:08,940 --> 02:16:10,370
丹，里面有孩子
LAURIE: Dan, there are kids in there.

1551
02:16:10,540 --> 02:16:12,700
每个人都请待在原处，保持镇静
Everyone, stay where you are and remain calm.

1552
02:16:12,880 --> 02:16:15,070
我们会把你们救出去的
We're gonna get you out of there.

1553
02:16:15,250 --> 02:16:17,410
屋顶就快塌了，让我进去
The roof's starting to cave. Get me in there.

1554
02:16:17,580 --> 02:16:19,050
我再靠近一点
DAN: I'm gonna get you close.

1555
02:17:17,810 --> 02:17:19,170
快走
Let's go.

1556
02:17:19,340 --> 02:17:20,500
赶快
Come on.

1557
02:17:20,680 --> 02:17:22,270
来，都上去
All right, let's move it, people.

1558
02:17:29,020 --> 02:17:33,820
妈妈，那人坐的是火箭吗？
Mom, is that guy in the space rocket?

1559
02:17:34,260 --> 02:17:36,490
他是耶稣嘛？
Is that Jesus?

1560
02:17:36,660 --> 02:17:38,490
不，亲爱的
No, baby.

1561
02:17:39,400 --> 02:17:41,520
- 小心一点 - 好的
DAN: Watch your step. LAURIE: All right.

1562
02:17:43,870 --> 02:17:44,890
我们上来了
We're all set.

1563
02:17:45,940 --> 02:17:47,600
都到齐了吗？
Is that everyone?

1564
02:18:11,660 --> 02:18:13,960
再见！
MAN: Bye. GIRL: Bye!

1565
02:18:17,570 --> 02:18:19,130
不敢相信我们这么做了
LAURIE: I can't believe we did that.

1566
02:18:21,110 --> 02:18:23,570
- 他们会把我们和罗夏关在一起的 - 管他呢
- They'll lock us up with Rorschach. - Who cares?

1567
02:18:23,740 --> 02:18:25,710
可能明天第三次世界大战就开打了
World War III could start tomorrow.

1568
02:18:27,810 --> 02:18:29,140
对吧？
Right?

1569
02:18:30,810 --> 02:18:32,150
对
Right.

1570
02:20:57,260 --> 02:20:59,160
给我回来！
MAN: Come back here!

1571
02:21:01,770 --> 02:21:03,460
他死了，罗夏
He's dead, Rorschach.

1572
02:21:03,630 --> 02:21:07,830
当大家在暴乱的时候 我们却觉得应该给你份乔迁新居的礼物
While everyone's distracted, we thought we'd bring you a housewarming gift.

1573
02:21:08,010 --> 02:21:10,170
机械店买的
Something from the machine shop.

1574
02:21:11,810 --> 02:21:13,440
头儿，你注意到没有？
Hey, boss, you notice?

1575
02:21:13,610 --> 02:21:16,640
他不再说什么世界真小和离谱 那样的废话了
None of that "small world, tall order" crap.

1576
02:21:16,810 --> 02:21:20,050
他知道一旦我们切开他的门锁 他就完蛋了
He knows once we slice open his lock, he's next on the block.

1577
02:21:20,480 --> 02:21:21,610
没门
Fat chance.

1578
02:21:22,320 --> 02:21:23,450
你死定了，罗夏
You're dead, Rorschach!

1579
02:21:23,620 --> 02:21:27,280
我们有一整监狱想杀你的人，你有什么？
We got a prison full of killers out here. What do you got?

1580
02:21:30,230 --> 02:21:32,660
你的手，我很荣幸
Your hands, my pleasure.

1581
02:21:34,670 --> 02:21:36,660
我没法够到门锁，要把栏杆锯断吗？
LLO YD: Can't reach the lock. Should I cut the bars?

1582
02:21:36,830 --> 02:21:40,130
暴乱不会持续多久 我等了15年就等今天了
This riot won't last. I been waiting 15 years for this.

1583
02:21:41,270 --> 02:21:44,640
抱歉劳伦斯，你挡到我的复仇之路了
I'm sorry, Lawrence, but you're in the way of my revenge.

1584
02:21:48,350 --> 02:21:50,070
这不是针对你的，伙计
Nothing personal, big guy.

1585
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:53,510
头儿！等等！
Boss! Wait!

1586
02:22:07,660 --> 02:22:09,460
你该清楚现在的比分了吧？
Now you find out what the score is.

1587
02:22:09,900 --> 02:22:13,030
1比O，有种就进来
One-nothing. Come and get me.

1588
02:22:19,080 --> 02:22:20,740
快点
Come on.

1589
02:22:20,910 --> 02:22:22,540
我一直在想
DAN: So I've been thinking.

1590
02:22:23,480 --> 02:22:27,640
我觉得我们要对我们的同伴负责
I feel that we have an obligation to our fraternity.

1591
02:22:28,490 --> 02:22:31,550
- 我觉得我们应该去救罗夏 - 什么？
- I think we ought to spring Rorschach. LAURIE: What?

1592
02:22:31,720 --> 02:22:33,490
有人陷害了他
DAN: Someone set him up.

1593
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:37,920
还有关于乔使人患癌症的事情 都是一派胡言
And this whole cancer thing with Jon, it just doesn't make sense.

1594
02:22:38,100 --> 02:22:40,030
你还不明白
You didn't get it.

1595
02:22:40,330 --> 02:22:42,760
对，不过想从这么戒备森严的地方越狱
Yeah, but breaking into a maximum-security prison...

1596
02:22:42,930 --> 02:22:46,600
- 就和灭火有点不一样了 - 对，确实如此
...is a little different than putting out a fire. - Yeah, you're right.

1597
02:22:47,500 --> 02:22:49,340
会更有趣
It'll be more fun.

1598
02:22:52,620 --> 02:22:55,620
快点李昂德，我想闻闻他被烤熟的味道
Hurry, Lloyd. I wanna smell this son of a bitch cooking.

1599
02:23:00,900 --> 02:23:02,630
太棒了
Yes.

1600
02:23:07,370 --> 02:23:08,400
不妙
No.

1601
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:27,160
之前还真没利用过马桶干掉过一个人 显然真的没有过
Never disposed of sewage with a toilet before. Obvious, really.

1602
02:23:27,990 --> 02:23:31,290
2比O，该你出招了
Two-nothing. Your move.

1603
02:23:34,630 --> 02:23:36,260
给我让开！
BIG FIGURE: Get out of the way!

1604
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:05,060
你怎么知道他还活着？
How do we know he's still alive?

1605
02:24:07,300 --> 02:24:08,530
他还活着
DAN: He's alive.

1606
02:24:20,280 --> 02:24:21,840
不要，不
No. No.

1607
02:24:22,480 --> 02:24:23,880
我的面具呢？
Where's my face?

1608
02:24:26,420 --> 02:24:28,150
别杀我
Don't kill me.

1609
02:24:31,820 --> 02:24:33,220
到你了，医生
Your turn, doctor.

1610
02:24:33,390 --> 02:24:36,590
告诉我，你看见了什么？
Tell me, what do you see?

1611
02:26:02,750 --> 02:26:04,480
不许动
Don't move!

1612
02:26:12,760 --> 02:26:14,520
罗夏
Rorschach.

1613
02:26:15,030 --> 02:26:17,820
丹尼尔，朱庇特小姐
Daniel. Miss Jupiter.

1614
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:21,400
抱歉，我得上个厕所
Excuse me. Have to visit men's room.

1615
02:26:21,930 --> 02:26:23,900
哦，看在上帝面子上
Oh, for chrissake.

1616
02:27:01,110 --> 02:27:03,230
看见你穿上制服真高兴，丹尼尔
RORSCHACH: Good to see you in uniform, Daniel.

1617
02:27:03,410 --> 02:27:06,840
早就该知道你只需要一对动人的双腿来激励
Should've known all you needed was nice pair of legs to motivate you.

1618
02:27:07,010 --> 02:27:11,240
- 你真是个混蛋，罗夏 - 请勿见怪
LAURIE: You're such an asshole, Rorschach. - Spare me indignation.

1619
02:27:12,480 --> 02:27:15,510
你挑了个好时间背叛乔
Picked hell of a time to be unfaithful to Jon.

1620
02:27:15,690 --> 02:27:18,490
是厌倦了爱国精神还是有人逼你那么做？
Get tired of being patriotic, or someone put you up to it?

1621
02:27:18,660 --> 02:27:21,320
你他妈的根本不知道自己在说什么！
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about!

1622
02:27:21,490 --> 02:27:25,360
嘿，先别说了，你们可以等下再吵
Hey! Would you two stop? You can argue later.

1623
02:27:25,530 --> 02:27:29,260
我不能让你们再吵了 我们得快点离开这儿
I had to turn the screechers off, so we'll be drawing fire soon.

1624
02:27:33,270 --> 02:27:35,640
站住！站住！不然开枪了！
Stop! Stop or we will shoot!

1625
02:28:14,510 --> 02:28:16,640
你还好吗？
Are you all right?

1626
02:28:18,080 --> 02:28:20,280
还好，只是
Yeah. Just...

1627
02:28:20,720 --> 02:28:21,980
感觉有点难过
...heavy, you know?

1628
02:28:22,790 --> 02:28:24,880
战争，越狱
War, jailbreak.

1629
02:28:25,420 --> 02:28:30,290
别太担心，好吗？ 一切都会好起来的
Don't worry about it. Okay? Everything's gonna be fine.

1630
02:28:35,300 --> 02:28:38,330
- 你好，劳丽 - 乔
- Hello, Laurie. - Jon.

1631
02:28:38,500 --> 02:28:42,130
- 电视上说你在火星 - 我是在那里
- TV said you were on Mars. - I am on Mars.

1632
02:28:42,710 --> 02:28:45,110
我要和你在那儿好好谈谈
You and I are about to have a conversation there.

1633
02:28:45,280 --> 02:28:46,740
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

1634
02:28:46,910 --> 02:28:49,570
你得努力说服我去拯救这个世界
You're going to try to convince me to save the world.

1635
02:28:55,490 --> 02:28:58,480
- 劳丽，不要 - 丹，相信我
- Laurie, don't. - Dan, trust me.

1636
02:28:58,660 --> 02:29:00,320
我得走了
I have to go.

1637
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:07,990
很美，不是吗？
Beautiful, isn't it?

1638
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:15,770
原谅我，我又忘了这里没有氧气了
Forgive me. These things sometimes slip my mind.

1639
02:29:17,180 --> 02:29:19,010
不会有下次了
It won't happen again.

1640
02:29:20,680 --> 02:29:22,670
那就好
LAURIE: That's comforting.

1641
02:29:25,020 --> 02:29:26,680
哦，我的天啊
Oh, my God.

1642
02:29:27,350 --> 02:29:29,180
我在火星上
I'm on Mars.

1643
02:29:33,190 --> 02:29:37,060
- 嘿，靓妞 - 嘿，混蛋
MAN: Hey. Nice ass. WOMAN: Hey, asshole.

1644
02:29:37,230 --> 02:29:39,820
嘿，让我们找找那个 喜欢连环漫画的在不在这里
MAN: Hey, let's see if that comic-book retard's up here.

1645
02:29:40,630 --> 02:29:42,570
嘿嘿嘿，你们
Hey, hey, hey. Yo.

1646
02:29:42,730 --> 02:29:47,430
你们都听说了吗？ 有个开着大猫头鹰的家伙把罗夏救走了
You all hear? Some super-owl dude just busted Rorschach out of prison.

1647
02:29:47,610 --> 02:29:49,330
- 罗夏？ - 对
- Rorschach? - Yeah.

1648
02:29:49,510 --> 02:29:51,370
那个混蛋把我的侄子打得需要坐轮椅
That fool put my cousin in a wheelchair.

1649
02:29:51,540 --> 02:29:54,410
你是说夜枭 他之前和罗夏是搭档，记得吗？
You mean Nite Owl. Him and Rorschach used to be partners.

1650
02:29:54,580 --> 02:29:57,240
- 对 - 可能他也有掺合你侄子的事
- Yeah. - Maybe he messed your cousin up too.

1651
02:29:57,420 --> 02:29:59,650
- 他是不是写过一本书什么的？ - 对
- Didn't he write a book or something? - Yeah.

1652
02:29:59,820 --> 02:30:03,690
告诉你，他现在就住在这附近的一所加油站那边
You know, he lives over a garage right near here.

1653
02:30:03,860 --> 02:30:06,520
- 明白？ - 是吗？
- Yeah? - Does he, now?

1654
02:30:09,260 --> 02:30:10,420
喂？
SALLY [ON PHONE]: Hello?

1655
02:30:11,430 --> 02:30:13,420
莎莉？
HOLLIS: Sally?

1656
02:30:13,600 --> 02:30:16,500
- 霍利斯？ - 是我
- Hollis? - Yeah.

1657
02:30:16,770 --> 02:30:20,670
霍利斯·梅森，这太不可思议了 我的上帝
Yes, Hollis Mason. Jesus.

1658
02:30:21,470 --> 02:30:26,100
你一直都有我的电话号码 却非要等到我们都老了才打？
All this time you've had my number and you wait until our sunset years to use it?

1659
02:30:26,280 --> 02:30:29,080
是这样，现在情况有点特殊，小莎
HOLLIS: Well, it seemed like a special occasion, Sal.

1660
02:30:29,250 --> 02:30:30,370
怎么了？
What?

1661
02:30:30,550 --> 02:30:34,780
新闻报道昨晚有场火灾
The TV is reporting there was a tenement fire last night.

1662
02:30:35,650 --> 02:30:38,450
受困人群是被一艘飞船救出的
There were trapped people rescued by airship...

1663
02:30:38,620 --> 02:30:44,190
他们说驾驶者穿得像猫头鹰一样
... and they say the pilot was dressed like an owl.

1664
02:30:44,360 --> 02:30:46,560
好像还有个性感女人和他一起
And it seems he had a sexy woman with him.

1665
02:30:46,730 --> 02:30:49,330
劳丽？我的女儿，劳丽？
Laurie? My daughter, Laurie?

1666
02:30:50,940 --> 02:30:54,060
我说服不了她再穿上制服
I can't get over Laurie back in costume.

1667
02:30:54,240 --> 02:30:57,700
或许她以后会感激我一开始 把她带上这条路
Maybe she'll finally thank me for getting her started in the first place.

1668
02:30:57,880 --> 02:31:01,470
小莎，听你说话的声音
You know, Sal, by the sound of your voice...

1669
02:31:01,650 --> 02:31:03,380
我觉得你比以前还年轻
...you're sounding younger than ever.

1670
02:31:03,550 --> 02:31:05,850
哦，谢谢你，霍利斯
Oh. Why, bless you, Hollis.

1671
02:31:06,520 --> 02:31:08,540
不过我还是老了
But that's probably just senility.

1672
02:31:11,320 --> 02:31:14,260
能和你聊天很开心，小莎
Well, it's been great talking to you, Sal...

1673
02:31:14,430 --> 02:31:16,790
但是有人在敲门
...but someone's knocking.

1674
02:31:17,330 --> 02:31:22,320
好的，不要太沉迷于怀念过去了
SALLY: Well, don't get too misty-eyed thinking about old times.

1675
02:31:23,200 --> 02:31:25,030
保重，霍利斯
You take care now, Hollis.

1676
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:26,500
你也是
Ah, you too.

1677
02:31:26,670 --> 02:31:27,900
拜
Bye.

1678
02:31:28,470 --> 02:31:29,960
拜
Bye.

1679
02:31:33,410 --> 02:31:35,710
我们想找猫头鹰先生
MAN 1: We're looking for Mr. Owl.

1680
02:31:36,580 --> 02:31:38,780
请稍等
Yeah. Hold your horses.

1681
02:31:38,950 --> 02:31:40,510
你在吗？
MAN 1: Mr. Owl, you there?

1682
02:31:41,090 --> 02:31:42,480
不请吃就捣乱 （万圣节孩子到别人家要糖说的话）
MAN 2: Trick or treat.

1683
02:31:44,090 --> 02:31:45,680
退休了就该老实点，猫头鹰先生
MAN 1: You should've stayed retired, Owl.

1684
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:52,480
我恨这样
RORSCHACH: I hate this.

1685
02:32:52,660 --> 02:32:56,890
萎缩在地下，躲避着当局
Cowering in cave, hiding from authorities.

1686
02:32:57,130 --> 02:33:00,330
警察在外面追捕我们，除非你想回到监狱去
Cops are out there hunting us. Unless you wanna go back to prison...

1687
02:33:00,500 --> 02:33:02,970
不然随便外出都不是个好主意
...we'd be stupid to expose ourselves without a plan.

1688
02:33:03,130 --> 02:33:05,400
那要怎么样？
And what would that be?

1689
02:33:05,740 --> 02:33:09,430
只要我们能伪造这个图案
Once we've established a pattern...

1690
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:11,970
我们就能入侵金字塔公司 看看能发现什么
...we can break into Pyramid, see what we find.

1691
02:33:12,140 --> 02:33:14,580
那样行不通
RORSCHACH: Did that. Dead end.

1692
02:33:14,750 --> 02:33:19,340
我觉得那只是个掩护幕后人用的公司 但是却证明不了这点
I think it's a front company for whoever's really behind it, but can't prove it.

1693
02:33:22,290 --> 02:33:26,620
我们只需要找找黑社会的线人 严刑逼供一下他们
We need to hit up underworld contacts, squeeze people.

1694
02:33:26,790 --> 02:33:29,520
也可以，还不如我们 直接从电话簿里挑人问
Sure, why don't we just pick names out of a phone book?

1695
02:33:29,690 --> 02:33:31,820
你忘了我们以前是怎么做事的，丹尼尔
You forgot how we do things, Daniel.

1696
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:36,460
你变得软弱和盲目 尤其是面对女人的时候
You've gone too soft. Too trusting. Especially with women.

1697
02:33:36,630 --> 02:33:38,730
够了，住嘴，我不想再听
Okay, no. Listen, I've had it with that.

1698
02:33:38,900 --> 02:33:40,930
天哪，你以为你是谁？罗夏？
God, who do you think you are, Rorschach?

1699
02:33:41,110 --> 02:33:43,200
我救了你，你不感激反而诽谤我？
You live off people while insulting them...

1700
02:33:43,370 --> 02:33:47,170
没人会埋怨你，因为他们都觉得你是个疯子
...and no one complains because they think you're a goddamn lunatic.

1701
02:33:59,160 --> 02:34:00,990
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1702
02:34:03,660 --> 02:34:05,820
我不该那么说
I shouldn't have said that, man.

1703
02:34:07,830 --> 02:34:09,160
丹尼尔
Daniel...

1704
02:34:10,670 --> 02:34:13,140
你是我的好朋友
...you are a good friend.

1705
02:34:16,010 --> 02:34:19,170
我知道和我想处很难
I know it can be difficult with me sometimes.

1706
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:27,170
别介意
Forget it.

1707
02:34:28,350 --> 02:34:30,010
没事的，伙计
It's okay, man.

1708
02:34:31,290 --> 02:34:32,880
就照你的办法做
Let's do it your way.

1709
02:34:51,940 --> 02:34:53,240
哦，上帝
Oh, God.

1710
02:34:53,410 --> 02:34:57,780
金字塔跨国公司，有人听说过吗？
Pyramid Transnational. Anyone heard of it?

1711
02:35:05,260 --> 02:35:06,750
哦，你们这些混蛋
Oh, you bastards.

1712
02:35:06,920 --> 02:35:10,020
我请这里每个人喝酒，你们就这样出卖我？
I buy everyone a round and you sell me out like this?

1713
02:35:11,230 --> 02:35:14,530
滚开，不然我就把这杯子 黏在你潮湿的脸上
Back off, or I'll stick this glass in your squidgy face.

1714
02:35:16,230 --> 02:35:19,170
大家保持镇静 我们会尽快完事的
Everybody stay calm. We'll try to keep this brief.

1715
02:35:21,270 --> 02:35:23,430
罗伊·切丝，金字塔的工资单上的人
Roy Chess. On Pyramid payroll.

1716
02:35:23,610 --> 02:35:28,100
试图谋杀阿德里安·维特，现在已经死了 你知道他吗？
Tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Dead now. Did you know him?

1717
02:35:28,280 --> 02:35:29,940
不
No.

1718
02:35:31,320 --> 02:35:32,580
知道，知道
Yeah, yeah!

1719
02:35:32,750 --> 02:35:35,690
- 我雇用了他，很了解他 - 你这个混蛋
- I hired him. I knew him from the inside. - You're a felon.

1720
02:35:35,850 --> 02:35:38,820
曾经是，但我出狱之后就改过自新了
I was. I've been straight ever since I got out, I swear.

1721
02:35:38,990 --> 02:35:42,720
我也不过是稍微知道点儿他 其实我也不过是接受命令雇用他而已
I barely knew Chess that well, but I was told to hire from the old life.

1722
02:35:42,890 --> 02:35:46,490
- 谁让你做的？ - 我的接头人，斯莱特
- Told by whom? - My contact, Miss Slater.

1723
02:35:46,660 --> 02:35:49,260
珍妮·斯莱特也为金字塔工作？
Janey Slater works for Pyramid too?

1724
02:35:49,430 --> 02:35:53,390
是的，她真是个好人 她说雇用有前科的人是公司政策的一部分
Yeah, she was real nice. She said hiring ex-cons was part of the company program.

1725
02:35:53,570 --> 02:35:57,270
给他们改过自新的机会 上帝，放过我吧，我说的都是实话
Give people a second chance. God, please let go! I'm telling the truth!

1726
02:36:01,410 --> 02:36:04,640
珍妮·斯莱特，曼哈顿的前女友
Janey Slater, Manhattan's old girlfriend.

1727
02:36:04,820 --> 02:36:07,510
阿德里安能帮我们查到谁在公司背后
Adrian might help us find out who's underwriting Pyramid.

1728
02:36:07,690 --> 02:36:08,740
顺着现金流查
Follow the money.

1729
02:36:08,920 --> 02:36:12,190
不到一个小时之前
WOMAN [ON TV]:former member of the Minutemen Hollis Mason found murdered...

1730
02:36:12,360 --> 02:36:14,690
前组织成员霍利斯·梅森被发现 在其公寓被谋杀
... in his apartment less than an hour ago.

1731
02:36:14,860 --> 02:36:18,960
目击者称当地一个叫结首帮的黑帮
Witnesses reported seeing members of a local gang known as the Knot-Tops...

1732
02:36:19,130 --> 02:36:22,400
在估计的案发时间离开了现场
... leaving the area right around the estimated time of death.

1733
02:36:22,570 --> 02:36:25,500
为您播报
Reporting live, Tiffany Burns...

1734
02:36:27,840 --> 02:36:30,830
- 是谁干的？ - 我就知道你要怀疑我，伙计
- Who did it? - I knew you were gonna victimize me, man.

1735
02:36:31,010 --> 02:36:33,140
我的公民权利呢？就因为我穿了件
What about my civil rights? Just because I'm wearing...

1736
02:36:33,310 --> 02:36:36,370
- 告诉我谁干的？ - 很多人都这么穿
- Tell me who did it! - A lot of people dress like this.

1737
02:36:37,720 --> 02:36:39,620
谁杀了霍利斯·梅森？
Who murdered Hollis Mason?

1738
02:36:45,290 --> 02:36:47,550
告诉你的朋友们，他们死定了
You tell your friends they're dead.

1739
02:36:47,730 --> 02:36:51,290
我要踏平你们的老巢！
I'm gonna take out this entire rathole neighborhood.

1740
02:36:51,460 --> 02:36:53,950
我要拧断你的脖子！
I'll break your neck!

1741
02:36:54,530 --> 02:36:57,520
丹尼尔，别在公众面前这样
Daniel, not in front of the civilians.

1742
02:36:58,140 --> 02:37:00,930
该死的，该死的，霍利斯
Oh, goddamn. Goddamn, Hollis.

1743
02:37:10,980 --> 02:37:14,150
这就是我们要谈话的地方
JON: This is where we hold our conversation.

1744
02:37:14,750 --> 02:37:18,650
在这里，你会告诉我 你和德雷伯格上床了
In it, you reveal to me that you and Dreiberg have been sleeping together.

1745
02:37:19,820 --> 02:37:23,190
- 你知道我和丹的事情？ - 暂时还不知道
- You know about me and Dan? - Not yet.

1746
02:37:23,490 --> 02:37:26,330
但是等一下你就会告诉我
But in a few moments you're going to tell me.

1747
02:37:28,670 --> 02:37:33,690
如果你能够预知未来的话 你为什么还会对我离开你表现得吃惊呢？
If you already know the future, then why were you surprised when I left you?

1748
02:37:33,870 --> 02:37:36,070
或当那个记者诽谤你的时候？
Or when that reporter ambushed you?

1749
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:39,870
如果你一早知道结果为什么还要争论呢？
Why even argue about it if you already know how this is gonna end?

1750
02:37:41,050 --> 02:37:43,310
我没得选
I have no choice.

1751
02:37:44,620 --> 02:37:47,550
所有事都是事先注定的
Everything is preordained.

1752
02:37:47,720 --> 02:37:50,050
甚至我的回答也是
Even my responses.

1753
02:37:51,020 --> 02:37:54,620
所以你也就按着趋势走
And you're just going through the motions.

1754
02:37:54,790 --> 02:37:58,190
你这个宇宙里最强大的人 也不过是个傀儡？
The most powerful thing in the universe is still just a puppet.

1755
02:38:01,330 --> 02:38:03,990
我们都是的，劳丽
We are all puppets, Laurie.

1756
02:38:04,940 --> 02:38:07,430
我只是个能看清楚局势的傀儡
I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.

1757
02:38:07,610 --> 02:38:09,300
如果你是错的呢？
And what if you're wrong?

1758
02:38:09,470 --> 02:38:13,970
为什么我预测未来的能力 让你如此烦恼呢？
Why does my perception of time distress you so?

1759
02:38:14,150 --> 02:38:16,050
因为那让我感到你很冷漠
Because it's inhuman.

1760
02:38:16,210 --> 02:38:18,610
因为那是荒谬的
Because it makes me insane.

1761
02:38:18,780 --> 02:38:22,690
你总是说你要安慰我 但是都没有起作用
You always say you wanna comfort me. Well, it isn't working.

1762
02:38:30,090 --> 02:38:32,590
我不想和你争吵
Look, I don't wanna fight.

1763
02:38:34,100 --> 02:38:36,830
我为我和丹上床的事情道歉
I'm sorry I slept with Dan.

1764
02:38:37,400 --> 02:38:39,430
你和丹上床了？
You slept with Dan?

1765
02:38:41,140 --> 02:38:44,130
你刚才都说过自己已经知道了
You just said that you already knew about that.

1766
02:38:44,840 --> 02:38:48,840
我经常说
I said often...

1767
02:38:49,510 --> 02:38:53,850
你是我和这个人类社会最后的联系
...that you were my only remaining link to humanity.

1768
02:38:56,290 --> 02:38:57,780
为什么我要去拯救
Why would I save a world...

1769
02:38:57,960 --> 02:39:00,080
一个和我完全无关的世界呢？
...I no longer have any stake in?

1770
02:39:02,190 --> 02:39:04,250
那就为了我而做
Then do it for me.

1771
02:39:05,130 --> 02:39:06,530
如果你是真心的
If you really care.

1772
02:39:06,700 --> 02:39:10,130
当你离开了我，我离开了地球
When you left me, I left Earth.

1773
02:39:10,300 --> 02:39:13,200
那还不够表示我的真心吗？
Does that not show you that I care?

1774
02:39:16,410 --> 02:39:19,340
我在火星这里红色的世界
My red world here, now...

1775
02:39:20,340 --> 02:39:23,250
现在对我来说比你们 蓝色的地球还要有意义
...means more to me than your blue one.

1776
02:39:24,020 --> 02:39:25,740
我给你看看
Let me show you.

1777
02:39:43,870 --> 02:39:46,800
炸弹都准备好了，先生
KISSINGER: Bombers are fueled and ready, sir.

1778
02:39:56,150 --> 02:39:58,380
到时候了，各位
It's time, gentlemen.

1779
02:40:00,480 --> 02:40:02,880
把国防等级提到1级
Take us to DEFCON one.

1780
02:40:10,160 --> 02:40:13,260
不在家中，不在办公室
RORSCHACH: Not in penthouse. Not in office.

1781
02:40:13,430 --> 02:40:16,330
是什么诱惑了这个拥有了一切
What nocturnal proclivities entice a man with everything...

1782
02:40:16,500 --> 02:40:18,260
的男人在这么晚的时候外出？
...out into the night at this hour?

1783
02:40:20,340 --> 02:40:22,200
丹尼尔？
Daniel?

1784
02:40:23,440 --> 02:40:25,200
你和我一起去吗？
You with me?

1785
02:40:26,010 --> 02:40:29,140
- 是的 - 你在干什么？
- Yeah. - Then what are you doing?

1786
02:40:31,250 --> 02:40:33,010
我在找阿德里安的日程表
DAN: I'm gonna look for Adrian's itinerary.

1787
02:40:33,180 --> 02:40:35,950
可能他有存档
RORSCHACH: Maybe he keeps on file.

1788
02:40:40,460 --> 02:40:42,930
- 有点不对劲 - 我也觉得
- Something's not right. - Agreed.

1789
02:40:43,090 --> 02:40:47,860
珍妮·斯莱特, 死神, 罗伊·切丝 都为金字塔工作
Janey Slater, Moloch, Roy Chess all work for Pyramid.

1790
02:40:48,030 --> 02:40:52,660
死神说过笑匠提到的名单里 有他和斯莱特的名字在里面
Moloch said the Comedian mentioned list with his and Slater's name on it.

1791
02:40:52,840 --> 02:40:56,140
不管是谁是金字塔公司的幕后主使 都有可能使他们患上癌症
Whoever owns Pyramid could be giving these people cancer.

1792
02:40:56,310 --> 02:40:58,780
陷害曼哈顿
Setting Manhattan up.

1793
02:41:12,920 --> 02:41:14,080
有趣
Funny.

1794
02:41:14,260 --> 02:41:17,750
古代法老渴望世界末日的到来
Ancient pharaohs looked forward to the end of the world.

1795
02:41:17,930 --> 02:41:22,960
相信死人能复活 从金罐子里拿回自己的心脏
Believed cadavers would rise, reclaim hearts from golden jars.

1796
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:26,230
现在他们一定在期待中屏住了呼吸
Must currently be holding breath in anticipation.

1797
02:41:26,400 --> 02:41:27,630
法老？
Pharaohs?

1798
02:41:34,510 --> 02:41:36,540
找到一份曼哈顿的心理资料
Got a psych profile on Manhattan.

1799
02:41:37,180 --> 02:41:39,650
看看他们怎么说
See what the corporate head-peepers say.

1800
02:41:41,690 --> 02:41:44,210
“对象的情感持续退化
"Subject continues to retreat emotionally.

1801
02:41:46,520 --> 02:41:49,580
如果失去最后的情感连接
If the only remaining ties were to be severed...

1802
02:41:50,190 --> 02:41:54,150
我们预测可能他会脱离人类本性”
...we predict total detachment from the human condition."

1803
02:41:58,270 --> 02:42:00,030
我进入了
DAN: I'm in.

1804
02:42:24,670 --> 02:42:28,030
(母公司：维特国际）

1805
02:42:28,900 --> 02:42:30,230
不
No.

1806
02:42:32,400 --> 02:42:38,170
恭喜，维特先生 曼哈顿博士的能量反应堆已经连上了
MAN: Congratulations, Mr. Veidt. Dr. Manhattan's energy reactor is online.

1807
02:42:38,340 --> 02:42:42,210
你的支持和热情
Your support and your enthusiasm...

1808
02:42:42,380 --> 02:42:44,680
促成了这次成功
...is what has led to this triumph.

1809
02:42:44,850 --> 02:42:48,880
我们代表整个研究团队感谢您
On behalf of the research team, we salute you.

1810
02:42:49,050 --> 02:42:51,490
- 干杯 - 干杯
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1811
02:42:52,260 --> 02:42:56,390
生命中的什么不值得庆祝？
ADRIAN: What in life does not deserve celebrating?

1812
02:42:57,330 --> 02:43:01,420
这就是新的卡纳克（古埃及的首都）
This is the new Karnak.

1813
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:05,190
代表了过去两千年里人类梦想的顶峰
This represents the culmination of a dream more than 2000 years old...

1814
02:43:05,370 --> 02:43:11,640
一个因为你们无私奉献才达到的顶峰
...a dream now assured because of your unquestioning assistance.

1815
02:43:13,780 --> 02:43:15,440
为此
And for this...

1816
02:43:16,280 --> 02:43:18,610
我遗憾地宣布
...I am ashamed...

1817
02:43:19,780 --> 02:43:24,120
你们的奖励将与你们的努力不相衬
...ashamed that you must now share such inadequate a reward.

1818
02:43:25,790 --> 02:43:27,780
为法老们干杯
To the pharaohs...

1819
02:43:28,730 --> 02:43:31,720
他们的秘密和被他们所托负的 衷心仆人一起
...their greatest secrets entrusted to their servants...

1820
02:43:32,360 --> 02:43:36,700
被活埋在了黄沙覆盖的沙丘下面
...buried alive with them in sand-floored chambers.

1821
02:43:37,570 --> 02:43:39,970
好梦，先生们
Sleep well, gentlemen.

1822
02:43:40,640 --> 02:43:43,970
我们的新的和平世界将受惠于此
Our new, peaceful world will be indebted...

1823
02:43:44,310 --> 02:43:46,870
为了你们的牺牲干杯
...to your great sacrifice.

1824
02:43:47,810 --> 02:43:50,010
布巴斯提斯（古埃及的猫神）
Bubastis.

1825
02:43:54,180 --> 02:43:57,180
罗夏日记，最后的记录
Rorschach's journal. Final entry.

1826
02:43:57,520 --> 02:44:00,010
维特就是幕后主宰
Veidt's behind everything.

1827
02:44:00,190 --> 02:44:01,780
为什么？
Why?

1828
02:44:01,960 --> 02:44:04,020
他到底想要什么？
What's his endgame?

1829
02:44:04,190 --> 02:44:07,860
我想不出还有更可怕的对手
I cannot imagine a more dangerous opponent.

1830
02:44:08,070 --> 02:44:11,500
曾经开玩笑说他快到能抓住子弹
Used to joke he was fast enough to catch a bullet.

1831
02:44:11,670 --> 02:44:14,570
他自己就能够在雪地里干掉我们
He could kill us both alone in the snow.

1832
02:44:14,740 --> 02:44:18,440
那就是我们要去的地方：南极
That's where we're going now: Antarctica.

1833
02:44:18,610 --> 02:44:21,370
不管我今后是生是死
Whether I'm alive or dead upon this reading...

1834
02:44:21,550 --> 02:44:25,810
我希望这个世界能够坚持到 你们看到这本日记的时候
... I hope the world survives long enough for this journal to reach you.

1835
02:44:25,980 --> 02:44:28,540
我活的时候不妥协
I live my life free of compromise...

1836
02:44:28,720 --> 02:44:32,660
现在赴死的时候也不会后悔或抱怨
... and step into the shadow without complaint or regret.

1837
02:44:33,290 --> 02:44:36,280
罗夏，11月1号
Rorschach, November 1 st.

1838
02:44:38,130 --> 02:44:40,020
（纽约公报：苏联入侵阿富汗）

1839
02:44:42,070 --> 02:44:44,470
噢，愿上帝帮帮我们
Oh, God help us.

1840
02:44:47,540 --> 02:44:49,970
- 你今天是不是来早了，哈？ - 是啊
- It's a little early for you, huh? - Yeah.

1841
02:44:50,140 --> 02:44:52,370
我想上学之前看完那本书
I wanted to finish the story before school.

1842
02:44:57,850 --> 02:45:01,310
听着，这本书归你了，明白吗？
Listen, now you just keep it, okay?

1843
02:45:02,450 --> 02:45:05,050
- 哈？ - 归你了
- Huh? - It's yours.

1844
02:45:05,220 --> 02:45:08,160
我说，生命太短暂了，不是吗？
I mean, life's too short, right?

1845
02:45:08,430 --> 02:45:09,720
是啊
Yeah.

1846
02:45:10,060 --> 02:45:11,390
呃…
Uh...

1847
02:45:11,560 --> 02:45:13,150
谢了，老兄
Thanks, man.

1848
02:45:38,590 --> 02:45:40,920
为何死神弃我而去？
Why does death pass me by?

1849
02:45:44,030 --> 02:45:45,690
戴维斯敦？
Davidstown?

1850
02:45:46,960 --> 02:45:48,660
戴维斯敦
Davidstown.

1851
02:45:48,970 --> 02:45:51,370
我离那儿只有几里路
I was only miles away.

1852
02:45:51,540 --> 02:45:53,300
现在那镇子应该被占领了
By now the town was overrun.

1853
02:45:53,840 --> 02:45:56,860
那些恶魔们以为我已不是威胁
The fiends imagined themselves safe from me.

1854
02:45:57,040 --> 02:45:58,410
但现在我回家了
But now I was home.

1855
02:45:58,580 --> 02:46:00,980
我将要报仇雪恨
And revenge would be mine.

1856
02:46:08,650 --> 02:46:11,350
不，那不是黑货船上的强盗
No, not the brigands from the Black Freighter.

1857
02:46:11,520 --> 02:46:14,650
这认得这个人，戴维斯敦的一个放债人
The man I recognized, a moneylender from Davidstown.

1858
02:46:15,030 --> 02:46:17,150
既然戴维斯敦一定被占领了
With Davidstown certainly captured...

1859
02:46:17,330 --> 02:46:20,460
为什么这恶棍和他的婊子…
... why would this scoundrel and his wench be allowed free passage...

1860
02:46:20,630 --> 02:46:21,890
…能自由地幽会？
... for this midnight tryst?

1861
02:46:22,070 --> 02:46:23,290
他和他们勾结了？
Had he collaborated?

1862
02:46:23,470 --> 02:46:24,900
他背叛了他的人民？
Had he betrayed my people?

1863
02:46:25,340 --> 02:46:28,070
- 还有我的家人？ - 来抓我吧，宝贝
- My family? WOMAN: Come and get it, babe.

1864
02:46:28,540 --> 02:46:29,730
这儿
Here.

1865
02:46:38,820 --> 02:46:41,010
我的心变凉了
My heart grew cold.

1866
02:46:41,190 --> 02:46:44,310
在被这个通敌者和他的海盗主子 冷笑着杀死之前…
Was my wife comforted before her execution...

1867
02:46:44,490 --> 02:46:48,550
…我的妻子有没有得到过慰籍？
... while this collaborator and his pirate masters sneered?

1868
02:46:48,990 --> 02:46:51,360
我被迫作出决定，但这并不难
My decision was hurried, but not difficult.

1869
02:46:51,530 --> 02:46:52,860
你是谁？干什么？
MAN: Who are you? What?

1870
02:46:55,500 --> 02:46:59,030
他的脑袋开了花 就如同他体内的罪孽炸开一般
His head burst, as if pressurized by the guilt within.

1871
02:47:08,580 --> 02:47:11,140
海盗的婊子不值得同情
A buccaneer's whore deserves no pity.

1872
02:47:15,290 --> 02:47:17,450
两个人骑马来了这儿
Two figures had ridden here.

1873
02:47:17,620 --> 02:47:20,450
回去的必须是两个人
Two must ride back.

1874
02:47:24,600 --> 02:47:27,000
海盗的哨兵
A pirate sentry.

1875
02:47:27,160 --> 02:47:31,260
我不急不忙地走以免怀疑
I trotted unhurriedly to avoid suspicion.

1876
02:47:32,200 --> 02:47:35,330
他们的暴行 不会因为戴维斯敦的好人而停止…
Their violation did not stop with the good people of Davidstown...

1877
02:47:35,510 --> 02:47:39,670
但却极深地伤害和影响了我热爱的家乡
... but had cut deeply, infecting my beloved homeland.

1878
02:47:39,840 --> 02:47:43,140
我的戴维斯敦已经和印象中的不一样了
My Davidstown was not as I last saw it.

1879
02:47:43,310 --> 02:47:47,250
它已经被黑货船的诅咒深深地折磨过
Already it was afflicted with the curse of the Black Freighter.

1880
02:47:47,420 --> 02:47:53,720
很快，我将会涉险走进这些住在我家里的 恶魔和刽子手中
Soon, I would venture amongst evil men, butchers who now reside in my home...

1881
02:47:53,890 --> 02:47:55,590
并让他们畏惧我
... and make them fear me.

1882
02:47:58,160 --> 02:48:03,070
当我到家时，我发现街道出奇地安静
Upon my return home, I found the streets conspicuously silent.

1883
02:48:05,100 --> 02:48:07,900
我静悄悄地进入我原本的住所
I entered my former residence noiselessly.

1884
02:48:08,610 --> 02:48:14,410
小小地避免把这些海盗屠夫们从他们 放纵的熟睡中惊醒
Careful not to rouse the pirate butchers occupying it from their debauched slumber.

1885
02:48:20,250 --> 02:48:22,240
毫无察觉死神已在他们身边
Unaware that death was amongst them...

1886
02:48:22,590 --> 02:48:27,680
他们还没明白个究竟 就已经尝到了死神的拥抱
... they would know its dark embrace without ever understanding why.

1887
02:48:27,860 --> 02:48:30,880
不过有一个人醒了，很慌张
One, however, was awake. Frantic.

1888
02:48:31,060 --> 02:48:32,460
为了避免他发出警报…
Lest he should raise alarms...

1889
02:48:32,630 --> 02:48:36,400
…我在他进入这被夜幕包围的房间时 就把他打倒了
... I set upon him as he entered the night-wrapped chamber.

1890
02:48:37,130 --> 02:48:39,160
没有海盗过来，但更糟的事情发生了
No pirates come, but something worse.

1891
02:48:40,840 --> 02:48:41,860
父亲
Father?

1892
02:48:42,040 --> 02:48:46,670
我抬头看着这些熟悉的脸庞 因她们脸上的恐惧而住手
I look up into faces familiar, save for their terror.

1893
02:48:46,980 --> 02:48:50,280
从那无力而带血的唇中 她说出了我的名字
Through puffed and bloodied lips, she mouthed my name.

1894
02:48:50,450 --> 02:48:53,750
我的爱人，为什么？
My love, why?

1895
02:48:58,260 --> 02:49:03,750
突然我明白了一件事情 甚至让我来不及恢复神智
There came an understanding so large it left no room for sanity.

1896
02:49:04,560 --> 02:49:06,260
于是我跑了
So I ran.

1897
02:49:06,760 --> 02:49:08,630
她怎么了？
MAN 1: What's happened to her?

1898
02:49:09,530 --> 02:49:10,970
是你
MAN 2: You.

1899
02:49:12,340 --> 02:49:18,070
了解到我的天谴已经占据了我 欢呼着庆祝它那可怕的胜利
The knowledge of my damnation paced me, shouting, celebrating its awful victory.

1900
02:49:18,240 --> 02:49:19,970
我的推论是完美的
My deduction was flawless.

1901
02:49:20,140 --> 02:49:22,240
黑货船的确是朝戴维斯敦航行的
The Black Freighter was heading to Davidstown.

1902
02:49:22,410 --> 02:49:25,280
- 它应该到了 - 他往这跑了
- It should have arrived. MAN 3: He went that way!

1903
02:49:26,080 --> 02:49:29,610
你就不能告诉我这怎么能够拯救世界吗？
LAURIE: Can't you just tell me how this ends and save us the trouble?

1904
02:49:30,590 --> 02:49:32,490
结束的时候，你会流泪
JON: It ends with you in tears.

1905
02:49:32,660 --> 02:49:36,250
眼泪？你不回地球了？
Tears? So you don't come back to Earth.

1906
02:49:36,430 --> 02:49:39,860
某种程度而言，是的
At some point, yes.

1907
02:49:40,930 --> 02:49:43,870
到处都会有死亡
The streets are filled with death.

1908
02:49:44,030 --> 02:49:46,090
乔，拜托
Jon, please.

1909
02:49:46,270 --> 02:49:50,830
你得阻止这一切，每个人都会死
You have to stop this. Everyone will die.

1910
02:49:51,010 --> 02:49:55,340
但是宇宙根本不会在意
And the universe will not even notice.

1911
02:49:57,780 --> 02:50:02,010
在我看来，生命的存在
In my opinion, the existence of life...

1912
02:50:02,890 --> 02:50:05,880
是一种成本过高的现象
...is a highly overrated phenomenon.

1913
02:50:07,790 --> 02:50:10,090
看看你的周围
Just look around you.

1914
02:50:12,830 --> 02:50:17,160
没有那么多微生物，火星是如此美丽
Mars gets along perfectly well without so much as a microorganism.

1915
02:50:17,800 --> 02:50:22,360
这儿，是一幅永远在变化的地形图
Here, it's a constantly changing topographical map...

1916
02:50:22,540 --> 02:50:28,480
10000年间都围绕着地级做着地壳运动
...flowing and shifting around the pole in ripples 10,000 years wide.

1917
02:50:29,310 --> 02:50:30,800
请告诉我
So tell me...

1918
02:50:30,980 --> 02:50:35,350
这一切怎能通过输油管道来美化呢？
...how would all of this be greatly improved by an oil pipeline?

1919
02:50:35,820 --> 02:50:37,810
或是购物中心？
By a shopping mall?

1920
02:50:42,160 --> 02:50:46,460
那就是说有奇迹发生是不可能的了？
So it's too much to ask for a miracle?

1921
02:50:46,630 --> 02:50:48,760
奇迹，按照他们的定义，是无意义的
Miracles, by their definition, are meaningless.

1922
02:50:48,930 --> 02:50:50,420
我的上帝，乔！
Oh, God, Jon!

1923
02:50:50,600 --> 02:50:55,660
- 只有将要发生的才会发生 - 别再胡说八道
- Only what can happen does happen. - Just stop your bullshit.

1924
02:50:56,740 --> 02:50:59,270
停下这玩意，就现在
Land this thing. Now.

1925
02:50:59,440 --> 02:51:02,000
如你所愿
JON: As you wish.

1926
02:51:07,620 --> 02:51:08,680
你知道吗？
LAURIE: You know what?

1927
02:51:08,850 --> 02:51:11,550
你可以把我送回地球，让我和丹 和我妈妈
You can send me back to Earth to fry with Dan and my mom...

1928
02:51:11,720 --> 02:51:14,090
还有其他无用的人类一起被烤焦
...and all the other worthless humans.

1929
02:51:14,260 --> 02:51:17,690
不过你还是错了 你说这最后会以我的眼泪结束
But know that you were wrong. You said this ended with me in tears...

1930
02:51:17,860 --> 02:51:22,030
看：没有，可能你都说错了
...and look: Nothing. Maybe you were wrong about everything.

1931
02:51:22,200 --> 02:51:27,470
你抱怨我不以生命的视角来看待生命
You complain that I refuse to see life on life's terms...

1932
02:51:28,210 --> 02:51:31,970
但你也不从我的视角去看待事情
...yet you continuously refuse to see things from my perspective.

1933
02:51:32,140 --> 02:51:36,550
- 你封锁一切使你感到惧怕的东西 - 我不怕
- You shut out what you're afraid of. - I'm not afraid.

1934
02:51:36,710 --> 02:51:41,740
你想我按你的视角认知世界？ 那做给我看看，按你的方法
You want me to see things your way? Go ahead, show me. Do that thing you do.

1935
02:51:48,890 --> 02:51:53,990
魔法，梦想，这都是我以前拥有的 我是个英雄，该死的
Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before. I was a hero, goddamn it!

1936
02:51:54,160 --> 02:51:57,220
你变老了并不是我的错 你又有什么好抱怨的？
It's not my fault you got old. What do you have to complain about?

1937
02:51:57,400 --> 02:51:59,530
我养活你，还有你的孩子
I put food on the table for you and your child.

1938
02:51:59,700 --> 02:52:02,500
你怎么不去找艾迪？ 或许他能给你更好的生活
Call your friend Eddie. Maybe he can give you a better life.

1939
02:52:03,240 --> 02:52:05,940
即使是最肮脏的部分
SALLY: Even the grimy parts of it...

1940
02:52:06,310 --> 02:52:08,540
也在朝着好的一面发展
...keep on getting brighter.

1941
02:52:08,880 --> 02:52:12,470
知道吗？你妈妈一直是最漂亮的
You know, your mom, she was one of the all-time champion beauties.

1942
02:52:12,650 --> 02:52:17,090
- 你有和她一样的眼睛，你有 - 把你手拿开
- You got her eyes, you know. You got... - Take your hands off her.

1943
02:52:17,250 --> 02:52:19,380
嘿，美人，好久不见
EDDIE: Hey, doll. Long time no see.

1944
02:52:19,560 --> 02:52:22,320
我不这样认为，艾迪 上车
Not long enough in my book, Eddie. Get in the car.

1945
02:52:22,830 --> 02:52:24,690
现在
Now.

1946
02:52:25,660 --> 02:52:27,650
你就没有点道德底线吗？
Are there no depths you won't sink to?

1947
02:52:27,830 --> 02:52:31,670
上帝啊，莎莉，难道
Jesus Christ, Sally. Can't a guy talk to his...

1948
02:52:32,370 --> 02:52:34,060
和老朋友的女儿说句话都不行？
...you know, old friend's daughter?

1949
02:52:36,370 --> 02:52:37,700
开车
Drive.

1950
02:52:43,710 --> 02:52:46,510
那是场误会，就那一次
SALLY: It was a mistake. One time.

1951
02:52:46,820 --> 02:52:49,980
那个人想强奸你，几年后 他怎么不帮你养孩子？
Guy tries to rape you, and years later, you let him finish the job?

1952
02:52:50,220 --> 02:52:52,920
怎么了？你是喝醉了还是怎么了？
What? Were you drunk or just Ionely?

1953
02:52:53,090 --> 02:52:56,030
难道我这辈子要这么度过？
Am I ever gonna live this down?

1954
02:52:59,400 --> 02:53:00,520
劳丽
Laurie.

1955
02:53:05,400 --> 02:53:06,730
不
No.

1956
02:53:08,740 --> 02:53:11,230
不，不是他
No, not him.

1957
02:53:11,410 --> 02:53:13,500
笑匠
The Comedian...

1958
02:53:13,910 --> 02:53:16,000
是你的父亲
...was your father.

1959
02:53:17,480 --> 02:53:19,180
不
No.

1960
02:53:22,490 --> 02:53:28,190
不！不！不！
No! No! No!

1961
02:54:00,790 --> 02:54:02,780
我的命运
My life is just...

1962
02:54:03,460 --> 02:54:05,590
简直就是个玩笑
...one big joke.

1963
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:08,320
我不这样想
I don't think your life is a joke.

1964
02:54:09,970 --> 02:54:11,960
好吧
Yeah, well...

1965
02:54:13,800 --> 02:54:17,970
抱歉，我不相信你的幽默感
...I'm sorry if I don't trust your sense of humor.

1966
02:54:26,150 --> 02:54:27,810
我要是承认我错了
Will you smile...

1967
02:54:29,490 --> 02:54:31,950
你会笑个给我看吗？
...if I admit I was wrong?

1968
02:54:34,820 --> 02:54:36,820
关于什么了？
LAURIE: About what?

1969
02:54:38,830 --> 02:54:40,320
奇迹
Miracles.

1970
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:45,160
就像发生了一些几率很小的事情
Events with astronomical odds of occurring...

1971
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,490
就像是氧气变成了金子一样
...like oxygen turning into gold.

1972
02:54:48,670 --> 02:54:53,510
我一直都想目睹这样的事情发生
I've longed to witness such an event, and yet I neglect...

1973
02:54:54,180 --> 02:54:56,540
却一直忽视了，人类繁衍的力量
...that in human coupling...

1974
02:54:57,350 --> 02:55:01,220
数以百万的细胞组成了一个生命体
...millions upon millions of cells compete to create life...

1975
02:55:01,690 --> 02:55:04,480
一代又一代
...for generation after generation...

1976
02:55:05,360 --> 02:55:08,420
直到最后，你的母亲
...until finally, your mother...

1977
02:55:08,790 --> 02:55:09,990
爱上了一个男人
...Ioves a man...

1978
02:55:10,630 --> 02:55:14,220
艾德华·布莱克，就是那个笑匠 她有任何理由迁怒于他
...Edward Blake, the Comedian, a man she has every reason to hate...

1979
02:55:14,400 --> 02:55:18,390
出于对这种深不可测的几率的反叛
...and out of that contradiction, against unfathomable odds...

1980
02:55:19,070 --> 02:55:20,970
才有了你
...it's you...

1981
02:55:22,710 --> 02:55:24,040
独一无二的
Only...

1982
02:55:24,710 --> 02:55:26,200
你
...you.

1983
02:55:27,040 --> 02:55:28,310
出生在这个世界
- That emerged.

1984
02:55:28,880 --> 02:55:33,370
把如此与众不同的相貌
To distill so specific a form...

1985
02:55:33,550 --> 02:55:35,810
从所有错乱的基因中提取出来
...from all that chaos...

1986
02:55:37,720 --> 02:55:40,690
就像是把空气变成了金子
...is like turning air into gold.

1987
02:55:45,060 --> 02:55:47,050
就是奇迹
A miracle.

1988
02:55:50,570 --> 02:55:52,060
因此
And so...

1989
02:55:52,570 --> 02:55:54,400
我的确错了
...I was wrong.

1990
02:55:56,410 --> 02:56:00,240
擦干眼泪，我们回去吧
Now dry your eyes, and let's go home.

1991
02:56:27,770 --> 02:56:31,800
人造表层受压，温度上升
We got a bearing on that artificial structure. Heat signature's off the charts.

1992
02:56:32,780 --> 02:56:35,870
- 维特 - 我不喜欢阿基米德这样
- Veidt. - I don't like the way Archie's kicking.

1993
02:56:44,290 --> 02:56:47,120
- 引擎出毛病了 - 它们在结冰，抓牢了
- The engines. - They're icing up. Hold onto something.

1994
02:56:47,890 --> 02:56:49,920
丹尼尔，你飞得太低了
Daniel, you're coming in too low.

1995
02:56:52,800 --> 02:56:55,960
我不想打断你，但是也许我们需要飞高点
Don't wish to interfere, but perhaps should pull up sharply...

1996
02:56:56,130 --> 02:57:00,070
我知道，我正在尝试，该死的
I know! I'm trying. I'm trying to pull him up, goddamn it!

1997
02:57:27,330 --> 02:57:30,960
我正试着改变尾焰排出的路径 加快除冰
DAN: I'm gonna redirect the heat from the flamethrower to speed up deicing...

1998
02:57:31,130 --> 02:57:34,000
不过需要些时间，我们没有时间了
...but it's gonna take a while and we don't have time to wait.

1999
02:57:35,510 --> 02:57:36,970
你得多穿点
You need something warmer.

2000
02:57:37,510 --> 02:57:39,670
我穿这就行
Fine like this.

2001
02:58:09,170 --> 02:58:11,040
怎么了，宝贝？
What is it, girl?

2002
02:58:13,340 --> 02:58:15,040
唔
Mm.

2003
02:58:40,640 --> 02:58:42,900
阿德里安是和平主义者
DAN: Adrian's a pacifist.

2004
02:58:43,110 --> 02:58:47,740
他是个素食主义者 一生中都没有过杀生
He's a vegetarian, for chrissakes. He's never killed anyone in his life.

2005
02:58:47,910 --> 02:58:49,310
希特勒也是素食主义者
Hitler was vegetarian.

2006
02:58:49,480 --> 02:58:54,010
你太畏手畏脚了，把他交给我吧 我们不会有第二次机会了
You're squeamish, leave him to me. We won't get second chance.

2007
03:00:05,260 --> 03:00:06,590
先生们
Gentlemen.

2008
03:00:07,090 --> 03:00:11,030
- 欢迎你们 - 阿德里安，我们都知道了
- Welcome. - Adrian, we know everything.

2009
03:00:11,190 --> 03:00:12,960
那我们还有什么好说的，丹？
Then what's there to discuss, Dan?

2010
03:00:13,130 --> 03:00:16,120
多着呢，你杀了笑匠
Plenty. You killed Comedian.

2011
03:00:16,300 --> 03:00:17,820
希望他安息
May he rest in peace.

2012
03:00:18,330 --> 03:00:20,930
布莱克首先想明白的
Blake figured it out first.

2013
03:00:21,100 --> 03:00:25,170
尼克松派他监视我们，确保我们不搞破坏
Nixon had him keeping tabs on us, making sure we weren't rocking the boat.

2014
03:00:26,110 --> 03:00:28,370
布莱克发现了我在卡纳克做的事情
Blake found out what I was doing here in Karnak...

2015
03:00:28,550 --> 03:00:32,610
他去拜访可怜的死神的时候 已经快不行了
... and by the time he visited poor Moloch, he was cracking badly.

2016
03:00:32,780 --> 03:00:36,050
连我都无法想象他会改变主意
Even I couldn't predict he'd be the one to have a change of heart.

2017
03:00:36,790 --> 03:00:38,310
所以
So...

2018
03:00:39,360 --> 03:00:41,290
我不得不杀他灭口
...I had to kill him.

2019
03:00:41,860 --> 03:00:45,620
然后我摆平了乔，真不容易
Then I neutralized Jon. No easy task.

2020
03:00:45,800 --> 03:00:48,260
我花了20亿去研究超光速粒子
I put roughly $2 billion into tachyon research...

2021
03:00:48,430 --> 03:00:50,460
来阻断乔对未来的预测
...to block Jon's vision of the future.

2022
03:00:50,630 --> 03:00:52,900
你利用心理操纵了他
RORSCHACH: You used his psych profile to manipulate him.

2023
03:00:53,400 --> 03:00:54,870
让他离开了这个星球
Got him to leave the planet.

2024
03:00:55,040 --> 03:00:58,440
我认识乔很长时间了 知道他无法摆脱情绪的困扰
I've known Jon long enough to see he isn't devoid of emotion.

2025
03:00:58,610 --> 03:01:02,510
他微妙的面部变化，对外人来说可能可以瞒过去 不过对我来说
His subtle facial twitches wouldn't be noticed by the layman, but to me...

2026
03:01:02,680 --> 03:01:04,510
他并不是无敌的
... he might as well have been sobbing.

2027
03:01:04,880 --> 03:01:08,010
我所需要的就是继续干下去
All I needed to do was tug on the thread.

2028
03:01:08,180 --> 03:01:10,080
当他觉得是自己让心爱的人患上了癌症
The sudden flood of emotion Jon felt...

2029
03:01:10,250 --> 03:01:13,850
乔所感受到的那种突然的感情冲击
... when he came to believe he'd given cancer to the people he loved...

2030
03:01:14,020 --> 03:01:16,150
足以令他离开地球
... was all the excuse he needed to leave Earth.

2031
03:01:16,330 --> 03:01:20,160
你的混蛋杀手们，你雇他们想干掉我们
DAN: Your bullshit assassin. You paid him to throw us off.

2032
03:01:20,330 --> 03:01:24,990
切丝先生为了高贵的理由献出了自己的生命，丹
ADRIAN: Mr. Chess gave his life in the service of a higher cause, Dan.

2033
03:01:27,140 --> 03:01:30,230
我让他吃下去了个氰化物胶囊
I put a cyanide capsule in his mouth...

2034
03:01:30,410 --> 03:01:33,000
只留下一点
... leaving only one loose end:

2035
03:01:33,610 --> 03:01:37,050
那就是，你和你的面具杀手理论
You, and your mask-killer theory...

2036
03:01:37,210 --> 03:01:40,340
当你坚持跟踪一个真正的反社会人
... one you followed with the tenacity of a true sociopath.

2037
03:01:40,520 --> 03:01:42,210
我给警察提供了线索
I tipped off the police.

2038
03:01:42,390 --> 03:01:44,790
你入狱的时候，我才能更好的行动
Once you were in prison, I was able to move forward.

2039
03:01:44,950 --> 03:01:47,580
抱歉让你失望了
RORSCHACH: Sorry to disappoint you.

2040
03:02:00,770 --> 03:02:03,240
我们本该为地球谋福祉
DAN: We were supposed to make the world a better place.

2041
03:02:03,410 --> 03:02:05,140
丹，那正是我在做的
ADRIAN: Dan, that's exactly what I am doing.

2042
03:02:05,310 --> 03:02:06,640
核战？
DAN: Nuclear war?

2043
03:02:06,810 --> 03:02:08,970
灭绝人类？
Human extinction?

2044
03:02:18,620 --> 03:02:23,520
当然，我的道德底线保证了 我只做部分的牺牲
ADRIAN: Of course, my moral safeguards gave me pause at the necessary sacrifice.

2045
03:02:23,690 --> 03:02:26,660
全球的几个重要的地区
A few key regions around the globe...

2046
03:02:26,830 --> 03:02:32,290
纽约，洛杉矶，莫斯科，香港
New York, Los Angeles, Moscow, Hong Kong.

2047
03:02:32,470 --> 03:02:34,130
将会立即消失
- Disintegrated in an instant.

2048
03:02:34,870 --> 03:02:38,200
1500万人将死于非命
Fifteen million people killed...

2049
03:02:38,370 --> 03:02:40,430
这都是曼哈顿一手策划的
...by Dr. Manhattan himself.

2050
03:02:41,640 --> 03:02:44,440
这是第三次世界大战对地球的惩罚
The world's punishment for flirting with World War III.

2051
03:02:44,610 --> 03:02:45,740
乔不会这么做的
Jon wouldn't do that.

2052
03:02:46,320 --> 03:02:49,010
而事实只有我们知道
A fact no one outside this room ever has to know.

2053
03:02:49,650 --> 03:02:53,450
我一直致力的能源问题也已经初见成效了
The energy breakthrough I was working on just came to fruition.

2054
03:02:54,060 --> 03:02:58,050
这些年来，乔一直在帮我复制他的能量
All these years, Jon was helping me replicate his power...

2055
03:02:58,230 --> 03:03:00,750
却不知道我到底打算怎么利用这些能量
...unaware of how I planned to use it.

2056
03:03:00,930 --> 03:03:02,920
如你们所见
You see...

2057
03:03:03,830 --> 03:03:06,230
笑匠是对的
...the Comedian was right.

2058
03:03:06,940 --> 03:03:11,930
人性的残忍将不可避免地导致灭亡
Humanity's savage nature will inevitably lead to global annihilation.

2059
03:03:12,110 --> 03:03:14,910
所以为了拯救地球
So in order to save this planet...

2060
03:03:15,180 --> 03:03:17,240
我得用
...I had to trick it...

2061
03:03:17,610 --> 03:03:21,640
人类历史上最伟大的恶作剧来解决它
...with the greatest practical joke in human history.

2062
03:03:21,920 --> 03:03:25,320
- 杀上百万人 - 为了救更多的人
- Killing millions. - To save billions.

2063
03:03:25,860 --> 03:03:27,820
有必要的犯罪
A necessary crime.

2064
03:03:27,990 --> 03:03:30,150
你知道我们不会让你得逞的
RORSCHACH: You know we can't let you do that.

2065
03:03:31,590 --> 03:03:33,720
“得逞”？罗夏？
"Do that," Rorschach?

2066
03:03:33,900 --> 03:03:35,520
我不是连环画里的恶棍
I'm not a comic-book villain.

2067
03:03:36,370 --> 03:03:38,630
你们觉得我有必要给你们 解释我的伟大创作吗？
Do you think I'd explain my masterstroke to you...

2068
03:03:38,800 --> 03:03:42,970
如果你们能，哪怕一丁点，影响到我的计划
...if there were even the slightest possibility you could affect the outcome?

2069
03:03:45,710 --> 03:03:48,510
35分钟前我就启动了这一切
I triggered it 35 minutes ago.

2070
03:04:12,670 --> 03:04:18,110
最终，我来到了一片 在我面前无尽延伸的阴沉的黑色海洋
MARINER: Eventually, I came to a dismal black ocean stretching endlessly before me.

2071
03:04:18,840 --> 03:04:22,210
我怎么会让自己落到这样糟糕的境地 而我是以爱…
How had I reached this appalling position with love...

2072
03:04:22,380 --> 03:04:25,400
…我唯一的爱，作为我的指引
... only love, as my guide?

2073
03:04:27,020 --> 03:04:30,110
那个放债人漂到了我的脚边
The moneylender floated at my feet.

2074
03:04:30,290 --> 03:04:33,080
高贵的意图却将我引向了暴行
Noble intentions had led me to atrocity.

2075
03:04:33,260 --> 03:04:39,460
心中的义愤引发了我的幻想 那可怕的图谋只是我的妄想
The righteous anger fueling my ingenious, awful scheme was but delusion.

2076
03:04:39,630 --> 03:04:41,600
我哪里算错了？
Where was my error?

2077
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:47,100
为了重新开始回想 我抬起了头并看到了她
Planning to resume my flight, I raised my head and saw her.

2078
03:04:49,370 --> 03:04:53,810
那艘船看起来正在等待 并不是在伺机进攻
The vessel seemed to be waiting, not hovering to strike.

2079
03:04:53,980 --> 03:04:58,140
然而逐渐地 我明白了这单纯的动机把我带向了什么
And, gradually, I understood what innocent intent had brought me to...

2080
03:04:59,050 --> 03:05:01,780
然后我不自觉地向前迈进
... and waded out beyond my depth.

2081
03:05:02,920 --> 03:05:05,950
当我游向那已下锚的黑货船时
The unspeakable truth loomed unavoidably before me...

2082
03:05:06,120 --> 03:05:08,990
那说不出口的事实无可避免地显现在我面前
... as I swam towards the anchored Freighter.

2083
03:05:09,160 --> 03:05:13,490
它那黑暗、摇摆不定的桅杆占据了我的视线
Its dark and lurching mast filled all my vision.

2084
03:05:13,660 --> 03:05:16,630
我所有善意的计划全都终结于此
All my well-meaning plans had come to this.

2085
03:05:16,800 --> 03:05:20,570
我已想不起来那个我想要拯救的世界
The world I tried to save was lost beyond recall.

2086
03:05:21,470 --> 03:05:23,300
一条绳索垂了下来
A rope snaked down.

2087
03:05:23,470 --> 03:05:25,630
从水中，我抓住了它
Sputtering, I grabbed it.

2088
03:05:25,810 --> 03:05:28,440
然后在上面的甲板上，欢呼声骤起
And from the decks above, a cheer went up...

2089
03:05:28,610 --> 03:05:33,010
二者同样的粗劣和黑暗 它的恶臭亵渎着上天
... both gross and black, its stench affronting heaven.

2090
03:05:35,820 --> 03:05:38,180
根本就没有要攻占戴维斯敦的计划
There had been no plan to capture Davidstown.

2091
03:05:39,020 --> 03:05:43,050
他们到这儿来是为了收取 他们唯一重视的宝贝
They'd come to wait until they could collect the only prize they valued.

2092
03:05:44,260 --> 03:05:47,390
获取他们唯一真正想要的灵魂
Claim the only soul they truly wanted.

2093
03:05:53,400 --> 03:05:55,500
我就是恐怖
I was a horror.

2094
03:05:56,340 --> 03:05:59,670
我只能在恐怖中容身
Amongst horrors must I dwell.

2095
03:06:09,150 --> 03:06:13,180
- 老兄，这破玩意儿太扯淡了 - 可不是吗
- Man, this shit don't make no sense. - You're telling me.

2096
03:06:14,520 --> 03:06:17,820
抱歉，你留着这本垃圾吧 真浪费我的时间
Sorry, but you can keep this garbage. Wasting all my damn time.

2097
03:06:17,990 --> 03:06:21,160
嘿，知道吗，你总是到这儿来
Hey, hey. You know, all this time you've been coming here...

2098
03:06:21,330 --> 03:06:22,820
可我还不知道你的名字
...I never caught your name.

2099
03:06:24,570 --> 03:06:27,560
- 伯纳德 - 伯纳德？你开玩笑吧
- Bernard. - Bernard? You're kidding.

2100
03:06:27,740 --> 03:06:31,800
这…这也是我的名字
That's... Heh. That's my name too.

2101
03:06:32,440 --> 03:06:35,670
没什么大不了的 很多人都叫伯纳德
Not that big a deal. There's lots of people called Bernard.

2102
03:07:11,080 --> 03:07:12,450
（纽约邮报：战争？）

2103
03:08:00,900 --> 03:08:03,890
我的上帝啊，亨利
Jesus Christ, Henry.

2104
03:08:04,070 --> 03:08:06,260
我们为什么一点都不知道要发射了？
Why the hell didn't we get a launch detection?

2105
03:08:08,170 --> 03:08:12,610
这不是苏联，先生
It's not the Soviets, sir.

2106
03:08:13,180 --> 03:08:16,340
情报显示这爆炸的能量特征…
Intel indicates the energy signature...

2107
03:08:16,510 --> 03:08:18,950
是由…
...was generated by...

2108
03:08:19,920 --> 03:08:22,350
曼哈顿博士发出的
...Dr. Manhattan.

2109
03:08:25,190 --> 03:08:26,750
乔
Jon.

2110
03:08:29,760 --> 03:08:30,890
干涉
Interference.

2111
03:08:31,490 --> 03:08:33,390
大范围干涉
Cataclysmic interference.

2112
03:08:43,110 --> 03:08:45,870
简直无法置信这真的发生了
LAURIE: I can't believe it happened.

2113
03:08:46,880 --> 03:08:50,370
这不是核战引发的
This wasn't caused by nuclear warheads.

2114
03:08:54,450 --> 03:08:55,750
是我
It was me.

2115
03:08:57,790 --> 03:08:59,380
我
I...

2116
03:08:59,960 --> 03:09:00,980
我一手造成的
...did this.

2117
03:09:01,620 --> 03:09:05,080
- 你什么意思？是你造成的？ - 间接造成的
- What do you mean, you did this? - Not directly.

2118
03:09:06,060 --> 03:09:08,760
看起来像是我造成的
It was made to look like I did it.

2119
03:09:11,800 --> 03:09:13,230
阿德里安
Adrian.

2120
03:09:19,510 --> 03:09:21,500
说曹操曹操到
Speak of the devil.

2121
03:09:24,650 --> 03:09:25,670
- 乔 - 我知道
DAN: Jon... JON: I know.

2122
03:09:25,850 --> 03:09:28,010
必须阻止他 他杀了布莱克，杀了数以百万的人
RORSCHACH: Must stop him. Killed Blake, killed millions.

2123
03:09:28,180 --> 03:09:29,520
在这等着
Wait here.

2124
03:09:40,660 --> 03:09:43,030
阿德里安，收手吧
Adrian, stop this.

2125
03:09:44,500 --> 03:09:46,370
超光速粒子那招很聪明
The tachyons were clever...

2126
03:09:47,500 --> 03:09:51,840
但即便我无法预测你在哪，我也能把这些墙弄碎
...but even if I can't predict where you are, I can turn the walls to glass.

2127
03:09:53,180 --> 03:09:55,640
我该谢谢你
I should thank you.

2128
03:09:56,810 --> 03:10:00,010
我差点忘了那种感觉
I'd almost forgotten the excitement of not knowing...

2129
03:10:01,020 --> 03:10:04,010
不确定带来的快乐
... the delights of uncertainty.

2130
03:10:08,190 --> 03:10:09,850
原谅我，宝贝
Forgive me, girl.

2131
03:10:32,820 --> 03:10:34,510
你就是个混蛋
You're such an asshole.

2132
03:11:08,450 --> 03:11:10,380
维特，你混蛋
DAN: Veidt, you bastard.

2133
03:11:10,550 --> 03:11:13,020
- 你要敢伤害她，我 - 丹
- Lf you've hurt her, I'Il... - Dan...

2134
03:11:14,760 --> 03:11:19,350
醒醒吧，我的新世界不需要英雄主义
...grow up. My new world demands less obvious heroism.

2135
03:11:19,530 --> 03:11:21,520
你的
Your...

2136
03:11:21,700 --> 03:11:26,660
小男生似的英雄主义太多余了 你们有什么成就吗？
...schoolboy heroics are redundant. What have they achieved?

2137
03:11:28,270 --> 03:11:31,140
还是没能拯救地球
Failing to prevent Earth's salvation...

2138
03:11:32,110 --> 03:11:34,510
这就是你们唯一的功绩
...is your only triumph.

2139
03:11:34,710 --> 03:11:36,610
我对你失望透顶了，阿德里安
JON: I'm disappointed in you, Adrian.

2140
03:11:37,410 --> 03:11:40,910
很失望
I'm very disappointed.

2141
03:11:53,300 --> 03:11:56,460
我学到的第一招，就是重组我自己
Reassembling myself was the first trick I learned.

2142
03:11:57,130 --> 03:11:59,530
那次事故没有杀死我
It didn't kill Osterman.

2143
03:12:02,140 --> 03:12:04,500
你真的觉得这次能置我于死地？
Did you really think it would kill me?

2144
03:12:05,810 --> 03:12:08,970
我在太阳表面都行走过
I have walked across the surface of the sun.

2145
03:12:09,480 --> 03:12:12,640
我目睹了许多渺小又如此迅速的事情
I have witnessed events so tiny and so fast...

2146
03:12:12,820 --> 03:12:15,880
很难说它们甚至存在过
...they can hardly be said to have occurred at all...

2147
03:12:16,050 --> 03:12:19,680
不过你，阿德里安，你只是个凡人而已
...but you, Adrian, you're just a man.

2148
03:12:20,820 --> 03:12:23,310
世上最智慧的人
The world's smartest man...

2149
03:12:23,630 --> 03:12:26,060
对我构成的威胁
...poses no more threat to me...

2150
03:12:26,230 --> 03:12:29,360
不会比最智慧的白蚁对我的威胁大
...than does its smartest termite.

2151
03:12:31,630 --> 03:12:33,100
这是什么？
What's that?

2152
03:12:33,500 --> 03:12:35,370
又一个终极武器？
Another ultimate weapon?

2153
03:12:36,010 --> 03:12:37,730
是的
Yes.

2154
03:12:39,340 --> 03:12:40,810
可以这么说
You could say that.

2155
03:12:44,350 --> 03:12:46,280
遭受攻击
- came under attack.

2156
03:12:47,120 --> 03:12:50,450
数以万计的人死于非命
Millions of lives were suddenly ended...

2157
03:12:50,790 --> 03:12:55,990
这是曼哈顿博士自己犯下的罪恶
... in an act of evil perpetrated by Dr. Manhattan himself.

2158
03:12:57,790 --> 03:13:01,730
自从攻击开始，我就一直和
Since the attacks, I have been in constant contact...

2159
03:13:01,900 --> 03:13:04,890
苏联保持联系
... with the premier of the U.S.S.R.

2160
03:13:05,300 --> 03:13:08,130
不计前嫌
Putting aside our past differences...

2161
03:13:08,470 --> 03:13:10,630
我们同意一起
... we have both pledged to unite...

2162
03:13:10,970 --> 03:13:14,310
来对付这个共同的敌人
... against this common enemy.

2163
03:13:14,810 --> 03:13:16,800
同世界所有人一起
With the rest of the world...

2164
03:13:17,250 --> 03:13:19,270
用团结取得胜利
... we will prevail.

2165
03:13:21,820 --> 03:13:24,810
我们将永远铭记今天
This is a day we shall never forget.

2166
03:13:24,990 --> 03:13:29,190
我们会继续保护人类
And yet we go forward to defend the human race...

2167
03:13:29,360 --> 03:13:33,990
保护所有正义和美好的事情
... and all that is good and just in our world.

2168
03:13:35,330 --> 03:13:39,560
谢谢，愿上帝保佑我们
Thank you. God bless us all.

2169
03:13:39,940 --> 03:13:41,730
看见没？
ADRIAN: Do you see?

2170
03:13:43,940 --> 03:13:46,410
两个超级大国，从冷战中撤离出来
Two superpowers retreating from war.

2171
03:13:48,010 --> 03:13:50,440
我把地球从地狱中救了出来
I've saved the earth from hell.

2172
03:13:50,610 --> 03:13:52,580
我们一起
We both have.

2173
03:13:53,050 --> 03:13:55,240
对你我来说，同是胜利
This is as much your victory as it is mine.

2174
03:14:00,060 --> 03:14:01,550
我们现在能重新回去
Now we can return...

2175
03:14:02,990 --> 03:14:04,550
干我们该干的事了
...do what we were meant to.

2176
03:14:04,830 --> 03:14:07,690
我们需要真正的正义
We were meant to exact justice.

2177
03:14:08,030 --> 03:14:11,360
- 人人都将知道你干了什么好事 - 是吗？
- Everyone's gonna know what you've done. - Will they?

2178
03:14:11,530 --> 03:14:16,330
揭发我，你就会葬送这么多的人死所带来的和平
By exposing me, you would sacrifice the peace so many died for today.

2179
03:14:16,510 --> 03:14:19,940
- 建立在谎言基础上的和平 - 也是和平
- Peace based on a lie. - But peace...

2180
03:14:20,110 --> 03:14:22,300
他说的对
...nonetheless. - He's right.

2181
03:14:22,880 --> 03:14:26,840
揭发阿德里安只会让世界重新陷入到核战中去
Exposing Adrian would only doom the world to nuclear destruction again.

2182
03:14:27,020 --> 03:14:29,880
我们不能这样做
No. We can't do this.

2183
03:14:30,050 --> 03:14:31,820
在火星上
On Mars...

2184
03:14:33,320 --> 03:14:35,150
你教会了我生命的意义
...you taught me the value of life.

2185
03:14:36,130 --> 03:14:38,560
如果我们想让生命在继续延续下去
If we hope to preserve it here...

2186
03:14:39,360 --> 03:14:41,390
就必须保持沉默
...we must remain silent.

2187
03:14:45,230 --> 03:14:47,170
自己保守好秘密
Keep your own secrets.

2188
03:14:54,040 --> 03:14:55,240
想都别再想
Don't even think about it.

2189
03:14:57,850 --> 03:14:59,580
罗夏
Rorschach.

2190
03:15:01,350 --> 03:15:02,870
等等
Wait.

2191
03:15:03,920 --> 03:15:06,010
永不妥协
Never compromise.

2192
03:15:06,390 --> 03:15:09,260
即便是在世界末日面前
Not even in the face of armageddon.

2193
03:15:09,660 --> 03:15:12,650
这是我们俩的区别，丹尼尔
That's always been the difference between us, Daniel.

2194
03:15:23,710 --> 03:15:27,230
我感受过死亡
I've made myself feel every death...

2195
03:15:28,710 --> 03:15:34,620
我看见所有我为了世界和平 而杀害的无辜的脸庞
...see every innocent face I've murdered to save humanity.

2196
03:15:40,190 --> 03:15:43,890
- 你都理解的，是吧？ - 没有谴责
- You understand, don't you? JON: Without condoning...

2197
03:15:45,560 --> 03:15:47,460
或责骂
...or condemning...

2198
03:15:51,870 --> 03:15:53,800
我理解
...I understand.

2199
03:16:01,210 --> 03:16:04,340
让开，人们应该知道真相
Out of my way. People have to be told.

2200
03:16:05,210 --> 03:16:07,150
你知道，我不会让你这么做的
You know I can't let you do that.

2201
03:16:08,380 --> 03:16:11,380
你突然间发现了人性？
Suddenly you discover humanity?

2202
03:16:12,820 --> 03:16:14,650
说变就变
Convenient.

2203
03:16:23,370 --> 03:16:27,930
如果你一开始就关心的话 这一切就都不会发生了
If you'd cared from the start, none of this would have happened.

2204
03:16:31,710 --> 03:16:34,680
我几乎能改变一切
I can change almost anything...

2205
03:16:39,250 --> 03:16:41,580
不过不能改变人类的本性
...but I can't change human nature.

2206
03:16:42,920 --> 03:16:46,320
当然了，你必须得保护维特新的乌托邦
Of course you must protect Veidt's new utopia.

2207
03:16:47,590 --> 03:16:50,920
为这个，多死一个人又怎样？
What's one more body amongst foundations?

2208
03:16:57,100 --> 03:16:58,960
你还等什么？
Well, what are you waiting for?

2209
03:17:02,440 --> 03:17:04,270
动手吧！
Do it.

2210
03:17:10,380 --> 03:17:11,400
动手啊！
Do it!

2211
03:17:14,120 --> 03:17:17,480
不！！！
No!

2212
03:17:34,970 --> 03:17:40,740
我要离开这个星系，去一个不这么复杂的地方
JON: I'm leaving this galaxy for one a little less complicated.

2213
03:17:40,910 --> 03:17:43,400
我以为你又开始在意生命了呢
LAURIE: I thought you said you cared about life again.

2214
03:17:43,580 --> 03:17:44,980
我是的
JON: I do.

2215
03:17:46,320 --> 03:17:49,220
或许我得再创造点生命
I think maybe I'll create some.

2216
03:17:53,320 --> 03:17:55,650
再见，劳丽
Goodbye, Laurie.

2217
03:18:30,890 --> 03:18:32,050
来啊
Come on.

2218
03:18:34,530 --> 03:18:36,120
还手啊
Come on!

2219
03:18:40,540 --> 03:18:41,870
丹
Dan...

2220
03:18:42,340 --> 03:18:45,100
一个团结又和平的世界
...a world united and at peace.

2221
03:18:45,970 --> 03:18:47,170
必须有人作出牺牲
There had to be sacrifice.

2222
03:18:47,340 --> 03:18:51,710
不！你没有把人类理想化，你毁了他们
No! You haven't idealized mankind, you've deformed it.

2223
03:18:51,880 --> 03:18:53,640
是你毁了它们！
You've mutilated it.

2224
03:18:54,020 --> 03:18:56,180
这是你的遗赠
That's your legacy.

2225
03:19:04,730 --> 03:19:07,520
这个真实的恶作剧
That's the real practical joke.

2226
03:20:00,120 --> 03:20:04,110
我们再说一次，您的电视机没有任何问题
MAN [ON TV]: We repeat, there is nothing wrong with your television set.

2227
03:20:04,290 --> 03:20:07,740
您即将经历一次神奇的历险历程
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

2228
03:20:07,920 --> 03:20:11,090
体验前所未有的恐惧和神秘
You are about to experience the awe and mystery...

2229
03:20:11,260 --> 03:20:17,060
从心灵的最深处一直到外界限
... which reaches from the inner mind to the outer limits.

2230
03:20:18,270 --> 03:20:20,460
不喝点什么吗？
SALLY: Sure you don't want a drink?

2231
03:20:21,470 --> 03:20:22,490
我不想喝
I'm okay.

2232
03:20:23,570 --> 03:20:24,800
干杯
Cheers.

2233
03:20:26,240 --> 03:20:29,370
我有些事情一定要和你说
There's something I need to get off my chest.

2234
03:20:30,650 --> 03:20:33,140
我知道艾迪·布莱克是我的亲生父亲
I know that Eddie Blake was my father.

2235
03:20:36,150 --> 03:20:37,910
劳丽
Laurel.

2236
03:20:38,920 --> 03:20:41,250
你肯定对我有想法
What you must think of me.

2237
03:20:42,090 --> 03:20:44,620
抱歉，我一直都瞒着你
I'm sorry I never told you.

2238
03:20:44,790 --> 03:20:46,590
我早该
I should have...

2239
03:20:46,760 --> 03:20:50,890
我不知道该怎么办，我觉得很丢人 很傻
...but I don't know, I just felt ashamed. I felt stupid.

2240
03:20:51,070 --> 03:20:53,000
没关系了
It doesn't matter.

2241
03:20:53,840 --> 03:20:59,100
是命运让人们去奇怪的地方 干奇怪的事情
People's lives take them strange places. They do strange things...

2242
03:20:59,670 --> 03:21:02,610
然后，有时候还无法诉说
...and, well, sometimes they can't talk about them.

2243
03:21:02,780 --> 03:21:05,110
我知道这回事
I know how that is...

2244
03:21:05,850 --> 03:21:08,440
不过我想让你知道
...but I just want you to know...

2245
03:21:09,020 --> 03:21:11,850
你对我却从来没做过错事
...that you never did anything wrong by me.

2246
03:21:16,020 --> 03:21:20,290
你问了我为什么我从来不生他的气
You asked me why I wasn't mad at him.

2247
03:21:21,860 --> 03:21:24,350
因为他让我生了你
Because he gave me you.

2248
03:21:29,370 --> 03:21:30,460
谢谢你，妈妈
Thanks, Mom.

2249
03:21:33,210 --> 03:21:35,010
我爱你
I love you.

2250
03:21:42,550 --> 03:21:46,750
- 你好，朱庇特 - 哦，莎莉
- Hello, Miss Jupiter. - Oh, Sally, please.

2251
03:21:48,390 --> 03:21:52,990
抱歉，我得去梳洗了 等下见
Excuse me. Gotta go freshen up. I'll be right back.

2252
03:22:03,510 --> 03:22:07,670
- 你这怎么样了？ - 好啊，你那呢？
- So how's it going up here? - Good. How's it going down there?

2253
03:22:07,840 --> 03:22:11,340
很好，我觉得一切都恢复正常了
Good. I think I've got everything working.

2254
03:22:11,510 --> 03:22:16,140
阿基米德的系统升级了 熔补也完成了
All of Archie's systems are upgraded. Finished the tinkering for now...

2255
03:22:16,320 --> 03:22:18,550
我们要做的是开它出去兜风
...so all we gotta do is take her out.

2256
03:22:18,720 --> 03:22:21,780
哇哦，听起来像是个约会
Well, that sounds like a date.

2257
03:22:33,100 --> 03:22:35,370
我们会没事的吗？
Are we gonna be all right?

2258
03:22:37,440 --> 03:22:41,740
只要大家还认为乔在看着我们 我们就不会有事
Long as people think Jon's still watching us, we'll be all right...

2259
03:22:41,940 --> 03:22:43,810
到最后
...in the end.

2260
03:22:45,450 --> 03:22:47,610
我知道乔会怎么说
I know what Jon would say:

2261
03:22:47,780 --> 03:22:49,810
事情是没有尽头的
Nothing ends.

2262
03:22:51,720 --> 03:22:54,310
总是没有尽头的
Nothing ever ends.

2263
03:23:41,670 --> 03:23:45,440
西摩尔，我们都没有题材可以写了
Seymour, we got nothing to write about anymore.

2264
03:23:45,610 --> 03:23:46,970
国家里的每个人
Everyone in the country...

2265
03:23:47,140 --> 03:23:49,410
世界上的每个国家的人都拉着手
...every country in the world are holding hands...

2266
03:23:49,580 --> 03:23:52,840
为和平和爱欢唱
...and singing songs about peace and love.

2267
03:23:53,350 --> 03:23:56,220
感觉像是住在一个该死的和平社区里
It's like living in a goddamn global hippie commune.

2268
03:23:56,380 --> 03:24:00,320
里根说他要在88岁时竞选总统
Well, Ronald Reagan says he's gonna be running for president in '88.

2269
03:24:00,490 --> 03:24:02,320
我们来报道这个吧
We could run a piece on that.

2270
03:24:02,490 --> 03:24:05,650
西摩尔，太荒谬的话我们是不能拿来做头条的
Seymour, we don't dignify absurdities with coverage.

2271
03:24:05,830 --> 03:24:09,660
这还是在美国，该死的 谁会想白宫里有个西部牛仔？
This is still America, damn it. Who wants a cowboy in the White House?

2272
03:24:10,400 --> 03:24:14,630
要不然我去奇异故事档案里再去找点别的？
Okay. I could look for something in the crank file.

2273
03:24:14,800 --> 03:24:16,400
奇异故事档案？
Crank file.

2274
03:24:16,570 --> 03:24:18,560
随便吧，找点原创的
Whatever. Take some initiative.

2275
03:24:18,740 --> 03:24:21,370
想写什么就写什么，全交给你了
Run whatever you like. I leave it entirely in your hands.

2276
03:24:27,880 --> 03:24:32,580
罗夏日记，1985年10月12号
Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985.

2277
03:24:32,750 --> 03:24:37,210
今晚，笑匠死于纽约
Tonight, a comedian died in New York.
