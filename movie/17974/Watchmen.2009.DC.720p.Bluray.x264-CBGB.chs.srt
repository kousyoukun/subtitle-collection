1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:16,000
时间轴:黑带九段  分割:SHYPZMS

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,720
美国又一次错了
Wrong, as usual.

3
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,030
鉴于美国在东欧的无所作为
The United States' lack of action
in Eastern Europe...

4
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,640
苏联对阿富汗边境的侵犯
...proves that the Soviet Union 's aggression
at the Afghan border...

5
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,970
也一样不会遭到美国的公开反对
... will not be opposed publicly
by the United States.

6
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:44,350
苏联继续最近以来的一系列军事演习
Issue: The Soviet Union continued
its recent series of military exercises...

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,750
今天在白令海进行了一次核弹试验
...conducting a bomb test today
in the Bering Sea...

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,860
距离阿拉斯加南岸仅仅1500英里
...just 1500 miles
off the southern coast of Alaska.

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,390
理查德・尼克松总统对苏联发出了如下警告
President Richard Nixon
issued this warning to the Soviets:

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,050
美国不会发动战争
The United States does not start fights.

11
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:03,890
重申一下，我们的武装力量
Let it be clear we maintain our strength...

12
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,870
是为了保卫和平
...in order to maintain peace...

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,770
我们的任何对手都应该问自己
...so any adversary
should ask themselves:

14
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,000
打击美国所付出的代价
" Do the consequences
of attacking America...

15
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,810
是否要超过获得的利益
...outweigh the potential benefits? "

16
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,610
苏联的行动
As a result of the Soviet activity...

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,580
使得核科学家监督小组
...the watchdog group
of nuclear scientists...

18
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:28,160
把“末曰之钟”设定在午夜前五分钟
...moved the Doomsday Clock
up to five minutes until midnight:

19
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,630
也就是核毁灭的一刻
destruction by nuclear war.

20
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,030
请问
Question:

21
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,830
如果0代表没有可能
On a scale of zero to 10,
zero meaning impossibility...

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,340
10代表100%的可能
... 10 meaning
complete metaphysical certitude...

23
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:45,000
那么苏联袭击美国的可能性有多大
...what are the chances the Russians
will actually attack the United States?

24
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,470
帕特・布坎南
Pat Buchanan.

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,980
0…
Zero.

26
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,770
苏联决不会冒险发动战争
The Soviets
would never risk going to war...

27
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,780
因为我们有会走路的核威慑力量
...when we have a walking nuclear deterrent
on our side.

28
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,420
你指的是曼哈顿博士
You're referring, of course,
to Dr. Manhattan...

29
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,690
不过曼哈顿博士能否确保世界和平呢？埃里诺・克利夫特
...but does Dr. Manhattan's existence
guarantee world peace? Eleanor Clift.

30
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,590
但是他未能阻止苏联
Well, it hasn 't
stopped the Soviet Union...

31
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,430
拥有数量庞大的核武器
...from stockpiling record amounts
of nuclear weapons.

32
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,300
你觉得他只是个摆设？
You don ' t think it' s just posturing?

33
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,060
也许苏联
Maybe the reason
why the Soviets...

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,760
进行核弹试验
...are doing these bomb tests...

35
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,310
是因为受到曼哈顿博士的威胁
...is because they feel threatened
by Dr. Manhattan. Of course.

36
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,010
也许整个世界都有同样的感觉
Maybe the whole world feels like that.

37
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,490
苏联船只侵犯了领海…
Soviet ships have violated
the territorial waters--

38
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,550
我知道早晚会来的
Just a matter of time, I suppose.

39
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,850
这是笑话，完全是个笑话
It's a joke. It's all a joke.

40
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,750
妈妈，原谅我
Mother, forgive me.

41
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,500
我曾是个英雄，该死的
SALLY:
I was a hero, goddamn it!

42
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,070
这一行动是为了向南越政府表明
MAN [ON TV] : --an act clearly meant to send
a signal to the government in Saigon...

43
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,570
暴力和镇压换不来和平
...that violence and oppression
is not the way to peace.

44
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,400
去死吧，猪头
Fuck you, pigs!

45
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,670
祝你好运，高斯基先生
MAN 2:
Good luck, Mr. Gorsky.

46
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,620
治安员都离开这里
MAN:
Get out of here, vigilantes!

47
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,500
不
No!

48
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:43,600
爱德华・布莱克，67岁，6.2英尺，225磅重
GALLAGHER: Edward Blake. Sixty-seven
years old. Six-two, a solid 225.

49
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,970
身材像橄榄球后卫一样强壮
Guy was built like a linebacker.

50
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,040
对，我看过尸体了
FlNE:
Yeah, I saw the body.

51
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,270
这个年龄的人，很少有这么壮的体格
For a guy his age,
he was in terrific shape.

52
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,110
只不过他死了
GALLAGHER:
You mean apart from being dead?

53
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,840
这是厚玻璃板
That's plate glass.

54
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,920
开车踩着油门才能撞出一条裂缝
You'd have to step on the gas
just to put a crack in it.

55
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,150
肯定是被扔上去的
Had to have been thrown.

56
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,520
检查过卧室了吗
Check the bedroom?

57
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,630
是的，抽屉被扔到一边
Yeah. Drawers opened, tossed through.

58
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,860
床垫被翻过来了，很可能是抢劫
Mattress flipped. Probably robbery.

59
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,500
或者是制造抢劫假象
Or made to look like one.

60
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,430
看见了吗
See this?

61
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,970
与总统握手
-Shaking hands with the president.
FlNE: Whoa.

62
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,370
你觉得布莱克是间谍吗
Think Blake was a spook?

63
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,210
政府间谍还是秘密间谍？
Government or black ops?

64
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,410
我觉得…
GALLAGHER:
I think...

65
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,010
这件事不是你我能处理得了的
...this is way bigger than both of us.

66
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,420
罗夏日记，1985年10月12日
RORSCHACH:
Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985.

67
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:41,690
早上小巷里出现狗的尸体，被轮胎碾过
Dog carcass in alley this morning.
Tire tread on burst stomach.

68
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,200
这个城市害怕我
This city's afraid of me.

69
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:48,300
我见过它的真实面孔，街道只是另一种排水沟
I've seen its true face.
The streets are extended gutters...

70
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,370
而排水沟里流的是血
...and the gutters are full of blood.

71
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,010
当排水沟最终毁掉的时候
And when the drains finally scab over...

72
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,310
所有的歹人都会淹死
...all the vermin will drown.

73
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,350
他们的性和谋杀积累起来的罪行
The accumulated filth of all their sex
and murder...

74
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,820
会把他们淹没
... will foam up around their waists...

75
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:08,450
所有的娼妓和政客会大喊，“救命”
...and all the whores and politicians
will look up and shout, "Save us. "

76
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,060
我会轻轻地说，“不”
And I'll whisper, "No. "

77
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,430
现在整个世界正站在悬崖边上
Now the whole world
stands on the brink...

78
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,090
看着悬崖下的末日
...staring down into bloody hell.

79
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,800
所有的自由主义者，知识分子
All those liberals and intellectuals...

80
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,970
和能说会道的政客
...and smooth talkers...

81
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,600
都突然不知道该说什么
...and all of a sudden,
nobody can think of anything to say.

82
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,940
我下面的城市
Beneath me, this awful city.

83
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,880
就像充满尖叫的智障儿童的屠宰场
It screams like an abattoir
full of retarded children...

84
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,680
在夜晚到处都是奸情与罪恶
...and the night reeks of fornication
and bad consciences.

85
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:06,400
今晚，喜剧演员死于纽约
Tonight, a comedian died in New York.

86
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,940
有人知道为什么
Somebody knows why.

87
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,510
有人知道
Somebody knows.

88
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,280
不，我肯定听见了什么
No, I definitely heard something.

89
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,920
注意门
Watch the door.

90
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,780
嘘
Shh.

91
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,220
肯定是风，下次你…
Must've been the wind. Next time you--

92
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:12,970
一开始总是黑帮，人们常常忘记这一点
MAN: It all started with the gangs.
You know, people tend to forget that.

93
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,740
打扮成海盗和鬼
Pirate outfits, ghosts.

94
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,510
他们觉得戴上面具去抢劫很有趣
They thought it was funny:
dress up and pull heists.

95
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,910
就算捉住了他们，也会很快放出来
As soon as we'd arrest them,
they'd be back on the street.

96
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,920
因为戴着面具，没人能指认出罪犯
Nobody could pick them out of a lineup
because of the damn masks.

97
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,360
所以我们几个警察商量
So a few of us cops, we get together...

98
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,890
干脆我们也戴上面具
...and we figure, what the heck,
we'll mask up, too.

99
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,760
就能弥补法律的不足
We'll finish what the law couldn't.

100
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:41,600
很快，媒体听说此事，进行报道
Pretty soon, the papers get wind of it.
They ran with it...

101
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:45,440
我们就闻名全国了
...and oh, boy, we're a national pastime.

102
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,100
其中有我、美元钞票、天蛾人
It was me, Dollar Bill, Mothman...

103
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,650
都市队长，戴头巾的法官
...Captain Metropolis, Hooded Justice...

104
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,010
丝绸鬼魂和喜剧演员
...Silk Spectre and the Comedian.

105
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,710
关于他的故事太多了
Oh, don't get me started on him.

106
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,920
我肯定已经醉了，又给你讲这个伤感故事
I must be drunk already,
telling you this sob story again.

107
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,960
我知道你想说的在后面
I think you were trying to make a point.

108
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:15,030
我想说的是我们正赶上好时光，你们就不幸了
Well, my point is that we had it too easy.
It wasn't fair what happened to you guys--

109
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:19,340
你们只是吃我们剩下的，尼克松逼你们退出
You guys who picked up where we left off.
--with Nixon forcing you out.

110
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:24,840
尼克松这个混蛋，我竟然五次投他的票
Nixon, oh, that prick. To think I voted
for that prick five times.

111
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,750
总不能投亲共分子的票吧
Hey, it was him or the commies, right?

112
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,350
快深夜了，我该走了
Oh, wow, it's almost midnight.
Gotta go.

113
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,520
说实话
Truth?

114
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,930
你是个比我还要出色的猫头鹰，丹尼尔
You were a better Nite Owl
than I ever was, Danny boy.

115
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,830
霍利斯，这句话分明是胡说
-Hollis, we both know that's bullshit.
-Hey.

116
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,270
说话注意
Watch it with the language.

117
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,070
这可是当年打倒Axis队长的左勾拳
This is the left hook
that floored Captain Axis, remember?

118
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,610
-是啊 -最新消息
-Yeah.
WOMAN [ON TV] : This just in:

119
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,710
蒙面警员罗夏
The masked vigilante
known as Rorschach...

120
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,710
在凌晨袭击了一位警察
...has assaulted a police officer
in the early-morning hours.

121
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,570
由于违反了六年前通过的禁止蒙面的基恩法案
Rorschach is on the FBI's
Ten Most Wanted list...

122
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,550
罗夏被列入联邦调查局十大通缉犯名单中
...for violation of the Keene Act,
which banned masked heroes six years ago.

123
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,990
据说罗夏…
Rorschach reportedly incapacitated....

124
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,920
驱赶其他所有人离开
Forced everyone out except him.

125
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,620
哦，他会退出
Oh, he' ll quit.

126
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,130
当他死的时候
When he' s dead.

127
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,860
-下周？-呃…
DAN: Next week?
HOLLlS: Well...

128
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:20,630
你不用总是这么迁就我
...you know, you don't have to
keep humoring me like this.

129
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,970
如果你和漂亮女人有约会…
If you got a hot date or something....

130
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,940
嘿，我们退休的猫头鹰应该团结在一起
Hey, us retired guys
have to stick together, right?

131
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,580
怀念以前的生活吗
You ever miss it?

132
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,870
不，你呢
No. You?

133
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,250
一点也不
Oh, heck, no.

134
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,320
再见
Be seeing you.

135
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,390
你好，丹尼尔
Hello, Daniel.

136
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,220
罗夏
Rorschach.

137
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,600
我自己找了些豆子吃，希望你不介意
Helped myself to some beans.
Hope you don't mind.

138
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,210
当然不介意
No, no. Course not.

139
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,370
要不要加热一下
You want me to heat those up for you?

140
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,070
这样就很好
Fine like this.

141
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,840
你近来怎么样
How have you been keeping?

142
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,020
出狱了
RORSCHACH:
Out of prison.

143
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,950
目前是
Heard about you on the news.

144
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,790
听说你袭击了警察
Say you attacked a cop.

145
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,730
轻伤，都不需要住院
RORSCHACH: Minor wound.
Won't need hospitalization.

146
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,760
丹尼尔
Daniel...

147
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,230
看
...Iook at this.

148
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,640
-这是豆汁店标识？-人豆汁
DAN: Is this bean juice?
RORSCHACH: Human bean juice.

149
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:44,840
这一标识是喜剧演员的，上面的血也是他的，他死了
Badge belonged to the Comedian.
Blood too. He's dead.

150
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,320
我们到楼下谈
Let's talk downstairs.

151
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,990
可能是破门盗窃案
DAN:
It could have been a burglary.

152
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,860
也许凶手根本不认识喜剧演员
Maybe the killer didn't know
who the Comedian was.

153
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,770
普通破门盗窃案？能杀了喜剧演员？太荒唐了
RORSCHACH: An ordinary burglar?
Kill the Comedian? Ridiculous.

154
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,770
我听说自从1977年他就为政府工作
I heard he'd been working
for the government since '77...

155
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,110
颠覆南美洲的共产主义国家
...knocking over Marxist republics
in South America.

156
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,210
也许是一桩政治谋杀
Maybe it was a political killing
or something.

157
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,640
也许吧
Maybe.

158
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,080
也许有人想除掉我们
Maybe someone's picking off
costumed heroes.

159
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,350
你不觉得这话有些偏执吗
DAN:
You don't think that's a little paranoid?

160
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,080
他们就是这么评价我的？
That what they say about me now?

161
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,590
偏执？
Paranoid?

162
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,590
听着，喜剧演员多年来树敌不少
DAN: Look, Comedian made
a lot of enemies over the years...

163
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,250
即使朋友中也有敌人
...even among his friends.

164
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,590
说到朋友，霍利斯・梅森怎么样
RORSCHACH:
Speaking of friends, how's Hollis Mason?

165
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,430
他写过一本书，里面对喜剧演员的评价不高
He wrote that book. Said some bad things
about the Comedian in it.

166
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,670
我不喜欢你说的话，更不喜欢你跟踪我
I don't like what you're implying,
and I like being followed even less.

167
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:50,670
也许我是在保护你，说不定有人会来追杀你
Maybe I was keeping an eye on you,
in case someone's gunning for masks.

168
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:55,510
-你不是那种富有感情的人
-袭击一个人，就是袭击我们所有人
-You were never that sentimental.
-Attack on one is attack on all of us.

169
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,390
你觉得我们该怎么办
What do you suggest we do about it?

170
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,450
惩罚
Retribution.

171
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,160
-守望者已经是历史了 -尼克松这么认为
-Watchmen are over.
-Says Tricky Dick.

172
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,090
我这么认为
Says me.

173
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,330
没人知道你的真实面目
Nobody knows who you are.

174
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,470
你可以放弃，过正常人的生活
You can give it up,
try and have a normal life.

175
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,540
你现在过的就是正常人的生活？
That what you have now?
A normal life?

176
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,910
当你走在死于狂犬病的城市街道上
When you walk down the street
in a city dying of rabies...

177
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,550
经过流氓无赖的身边
...past the human cockroaches...

178
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,480
听他们谈论海洛因和幼女色情
...talking about their heroin
and child pornography...

179
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,180
你真觉得正常吗
...do you really feel normal?

180
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,080
至少我不用躲在面具后面
Least I'm not the one
still hiding behind a mask.

181
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,220
不
No.

182
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,020
你是藏在显眼的地方
You're hiding in plain sight.

183
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,560
再见，丹尼尔
Be seeing you, Dan.

184
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,540
维修道通往北面两个街区的地方
A maintenance hatch
will let you out two blocks north.

185
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,430
我记得
Yeah, I remember.

186
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:52,670
来过多次，那时我们还是搭档
Came here often,
when we were partners.

187
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,740
那是美好的时光，罗夏
DAN: Those were great times, huh,
Rorschach?

188
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,480
-后来呢 -你退出了
-What happened?
-You quit.

189
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,130
罗夏日记
Rorschach 's journal.

190
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,640
第一次拜访徒劳无功
First visit of evening fruitless.

191
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,900
感觉有些压抑
Feel slightly depressed.

192
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,350
很快就会有战争
Soon there will be war.

193
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,080
数百万人将会死于疾病和痛苦
Millions will perish
in sickness and misery.

194
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,780
为什么其中一个人的死就这么重要？
Why does one death matter
against so many?

195
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,320
因为存在正义与邪恶，而邪恶必须被惩罚
Because there is good and evil,
and evil must be punished.

196
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,330
及时世界末日就要来到
Even in the face of armageddon...

197
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,430
我也不会容忍这种事
...I will not compromise in this.

198
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,020
维特先生
MAN:
Mr. Veidt...

199
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,330
到目前为止，你是仅有的两位
...to date,
you ' re one of only two Watchmen...

200
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,940
公开自己守望者身份的人之一
...ever to reveal their true identity
to the world...

201
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,900
第一位是霍利斯・梅森
...the first being Hollis Mason.

202
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,070
你也得到了丰厚的回报
And you've certainly profited greatly
by it...

203
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,510
把你的另一个身份，变成数十亿美元的产业
...turning your superhero alter ego,
Ozymandias, into a billion-dollar industry:

204
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,740
玩具，午餐盒，基因工程
Toys, lunchboxes, genetic engineering.

205
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,980
听说还要拍一部电影
I understand there's a movie
in the works.

206
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:15,350
-你到底想问什么，罗斯先生 -对不起，你觉得…
-I'm not hearing a question, Mr. Roth.
I'm sorry. Do you think--

207
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,090
守望者会因为我借此发财而恨我？
The Watchmen resent me
for prostituting their struggle?

208
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,990
这是个不错的问题，我也想过
It's a fair question.
Yes, it's crossed my mind...

209
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,190
我原来的一些同事可能会这么认为
...some of my old colleagues
might see it that way...

210
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,360
就像你们知道的那样，有偏见的新闻
...just as you're clearly aware
that biased journalism...

211
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,130
才能让杂志热卖
...sells more magazines.

212
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,410
“维特产业”的销售部门与曼哈顿博士一起提供资金
The merchandising arm of Veidt lndustries
is funding our work with Dr. Manhattan.

213
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,510
我们最近扩建了在南极洲的研究设施
We recently expanded our research facility
in Antarctica...

214
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,910
希望开发出便宜、可再生的能源
...in the hope of developing cheap,
renewable sources of energy...

215
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,080
来消除世界对矿物燃料的依赖
...that we might eliminate
the world's reliance on fossil fuels.

216
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,690
稍有理性的人都能看出
Now, it doesn't take
a political scientist...

217
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,260
我们与苏联的冷战不是意识形态的问题
...to see that our Cold War
with the Russians isn't ideological...

218
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:54,920
而是因为害怕，害怕不足
...it's based upon fear.
Fear of not having enough.

219
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,000
如果能源是取之不竭的
But if we make resources infinite...

220
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,260
呃
...ah...

221
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,530
战争就会被淘汰
...we make war obsolete.

222
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:08,210
我希望各地的守望者
I would hope the other Watchmen
understand that...

223
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,070
对此能理解
...wherever they may be.

224
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,550
谢谢你们的时间
Thanks for your time.

225
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,450
-很不错，艾德里安 -丹尼尔
-You look good, Adrian.
-Dan.

226
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,860
久违了
It's been too long.

227
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,660
罗夏认为有人在追捕守望者？
ADRlAN: So Rorschach thinks
someone's hunting the Watchmen, huh?

228
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,200
你觉得这可能吗
You think it's possible?

229
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,100
一桩谋杀不代表一种趋势
Statistically, one murder
doesn't equal a trend.

230
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,210
罗夏是个反社会者，丹尼尔
Rorschach's a sociopath, Dan.

231
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,210
喜剧演员也是，他其实是个纳粹
And so was the Comedian.
He was practically a Nazi.

232
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,070
这点你最清楚
You know that better than anyone.

233
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,450
我不是为他而来
I'm not here because I miss him.

234
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,950
罗夏想到
It's occurred to Rorschach...

235
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,090
我们是唯一知道相互身份的两个人
...that we're the only ones
who know each other's identities.

236
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,680
所有人都知道你的身份
Actually, the whole world knows yours.

237
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,930
所以我第一个来警告你
That's why I'm warning you first.

238
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,520
谢谢你，丹尼尔
Thank you, Dan...

239
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,940
但是我觉得比起罗夏说的杀手
...but I fear there's something
much more real to worry about...

240
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,700
我们更应考虑别的事情
...than Rorschach's mask killer.

241
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:19,740
如果苏联人发射了核弹，乔真能阻止吗
If the Russians do launch their nukes,
can Jon really stop them?

242
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,550
苏联有51000个核弹头
The Soviets have 51,000
warheads stockpiled.

243
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,920
就算乔拦截了99%
Even if Jon stops 99 percent of them...

244
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:31,290
剩下的1%仍然能毁灭地球
...the 1 percent that get through
could still kill every living thing on Earth.

245
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,400
曼哈顿博士也不能照顾到所有的地方
Even Dr. Manhattan
can't be everywhere at once.

246
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:56,280
罗夏日记，1985年10月13日
Rorschach 's journal,
October 13th, 1985...

247
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,790
晚上8点半
...8:30 p.m.

248
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:03,390
与丹尼尔的会面很不愉快
Meeting with Dreiberg
left bad taste in mouth.

249
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:07,650
他成了懒散无能、只会在地下室抱怨的人
A flabby failure who sits
whimpering in his basement.

250
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,800
为什么只剩下很少的人能够积极
Why are so few of us left active...

251
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,840
健康、又没有精神障碍？
...healthy and without
personality disorders?

252
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,240
第一个猫头鹰开了家修车行
The first Nite Owl
runs an auto-repair shop.

253
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:23,810
第一个丝绸鬼魂成了肥胖年老的妓女
The first Silk Spectre
is a bloated, aging whore...

254
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,850
在加利福尼亚的一处疗养地等死
...dying in a California rest resort.

255
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,610
“美元钞票”的披风卡在旋转门里
Dollar Bill got his cape stuck
in a revolving door...

256
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,310
被人当场枪杀了
... where he got gunned down.

257
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,360
“轮廓”，被谋杀了
Silhouette, murdered...

258
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,630
也是她不良生活方式的下场
...a victim of her own indecent lifestyle.

259
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,190
天蛾人现在在缅因州的一家精神病院
Mothman 's in an asylum in Maine.

260
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,400
就连阿德里安・维特，也可能是个同性恋
Even Adrian Veidt, possible homosexual.

261
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:52,060
必须深入调查
Must investigate further.

262
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,010
我的单子上只剩下两个人
Only two names remain on my list.

263
00:27:55,550 --> 00:28:00,640
都住在洛克菲勒军事研究中心的营房里
Both share private quarters
at Rockefeller Military Research Center.

264
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,150
我应该找他们
I shall go to them.

265
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:08,860
我应该告诉不可摧毁的人，有人计划谋杀他
I shall go tell the indestructible man
that someone plans to murder him.

266
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,460
晚上好，罗夏
JON:
Good evening, Rorschach.

267
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:15,120
曼哈顿博士，你知道我何而来
RORSCHACH:
Dr. Manhattan, you know why I'm here.

268
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,730
是的
JON:
Yes...

269
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,970
但是你会失望的离开
...but you're going to leave disappointed.

270
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,870
罗夏，你不该来这里，你正在被通缉
Rorschach. You shouldn't be here.
You're a wanted man.

271
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,240
很高兴见到你，丝绸鬼魂
RORSCHACH:
Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.

272
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,470
我有真名
I have a real name I've been using.

273
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,670
说说看
Try it.

274
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,940
听你的，劳丽
Whatever you say, Laurie.

275
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,340
你为什么来
What are you doing here?

276
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,850
喜剧演员死了
JON:
The Comedian is dead.

277
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,110
罗夏想让我看看我的未来
Rorschach wants me
to look into my future...

278
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,920
看看凶手有没有查到
...see if the killer is ever
publicly identified.

279
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:44,190
我已经警告了丹尼尔，再来警告你们
Already warned Dreiberg.
Came to warn you too.

280
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,260
就算我想帮忙
Even if I wanted to help...

281
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,770
我的未来也被某种时间干扰遮住了
...my future is blocked
by some kind of temporal interference.

282
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:58,230
-我看不清 -干扰？什么造成的
-I cannot see it clearly.
-lnterference? Caused by what?

283
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:01,810
很可能是核毁灭
In all likelihood, nuclear holocaust.

284
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:06,640
如果美国与苏联进行全面战争
If the United States and Soviet Union
engage in all-out war...

285
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,810
核爆炸带来的冲击波会产生超光子流
...the resulting blast wave would produce
a sudden burst of tachyons...

286
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,950
它能逆时间而行
...particles which travel backward
through what you perceive as time...

287
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:19,930
因此遮掩了我对现在的视觉
...therefore obscuring my vision
of the present.

288
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,130
我必须回去工作了
I must return to my work.

289
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,420
等等
RORSCHACH:
Wait a minute.

290
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,090
如果有人因此想除掉我们呢？
What if that's why
someone wants us out of the way?

291
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,500
我们无法阻止吗
So we can't do anything to stop it?

292
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,500
再见，罗夏
Goodbye, Rorschach.

293
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,940
我费了很大劲才进来找到你
RORSCHACH: Took a lot of effort
to get in here to see you.

294
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,440
我不会走的
I'm not leaving--

295
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,040
除非我把话说完
--till I've had my say.

296
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,490
看来最近有很多事你没有告诉我
Seems like there's a lot of things
you don't tell me these days.

297
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,350
我不想过早的警告你
I didn't wanna worry you prematurely.

298
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,960
如果我和艾德里安能解决能源危机，也许战争能避免
If Adrian and I can solve the energy crisis,
war may be averted.

299
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,190
但你一直说时间是同步的
LAURlE:
But you always say time is simultaneous.

300
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,770
如果是这样，你怎能改变未来？
If that's true,
then how can you change the future?

301
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:06,930
如果你能像我这样看待时间
If only you could perceive time as I do.

302
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,370
我带你看看
Please let me show you.

303
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:19,290
魔法，梦想，这是我曾经拥有的
我曾是个英雄，该死的
Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
I was a hero, goddamn it!

304
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,520
你变老不是我的错，你有什么可抱怨的
It's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

305
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,130
我供养着你和孩子
I'm putting food on the table
for you and your child.

306
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,060
给你的朋友艾迪打电话吧，也许他能让你过上更好的生活
Call your friend Eddie.
Maybe he can give you a better life.

307
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,400
-当时是个错误，就那一次 -他想强奸你
-lt was a mistake. One time.
-Man tries to rape you--

308
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,070
停
Stop!

309
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,310
你的思想去了阴暗的地方
Your mind goes to dark places...

310
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,810
你在想我为什么不让你看到接下来的事情
...and you wonder
why I keep the worst from you.

311
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,180
-替我向丹尼尔问好 -什么
-Say hello to Dan for me.
-What?

312
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,750
你想和我一起出去吃饭
You wanna ask me
to go to dinner with you...

313
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,620
像以前那样
...Iike we used to...

314
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,190
但是你不会开口
...but you won't.

315
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,230
你知道我不能去
You know I can't.

316
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:05,130
所以你会给丹尼尔打电话
So you'll call Dan...

317
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,760
这很正常
...which is only natural.

318
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,700
应该有个老朋友来安慰你
You deserve the comfort of an old friend.

319
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,530
丹尼尔订的桌子
LAURlE:
Dan Dreiberg's table.

320
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,460
你是否知道他和H.J.曾经… -我一点不知道
DAN: Did you know that
he and H.J. were--? I had no idea.

321
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:15,030
还记得那个疯子吗，他自称什么来着
You remember that crazy guy?
What'd he call himself?

322
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,700
大屠杀队长
Captain Carnage.

323
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:20,070
经常假装大恶人，好被人痛打一顿
Used to pretend he was a supervillain
just so he could get beat up?

324
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,640
对，有一次在我面前假装，我没有理睬
Yeah, he tried that on me once.
I just walked away.

325
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,840
他就在大白天跟在我身后
He starts following me down the street
in broad daylight...

326
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,810
喊着：“惩罚我，惩罚我！”
...yelling, "Punish me! Punish me!"

327
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,580
我说：“不，走开”
I'm just saying, "No, get lost."

328
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,190
天啊，他后来怎么样了
God, whatever happened to him?

329
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,520
哦，他在罗夏面前玩这一套
Oh. Um....
He pulled that on Rorschach...

330
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,090
被罗夏扔下了电梯井
...and Rorschach
dropped him down an elevator shaft.

331
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,970
天啊，这可一点不好笑
Oh, my God. That's not even funny.

332
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,160
-有一点 -对
-It's a little funny.
-Yep.

333
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,050
很高兴我点了四条腿的鸡
WOMAN: I'm glad I ordered
the four-legged chicken.

334
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,180
能再次见到你真好
It's really good to see you again.

335
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,940
我也是
It's great seeing you too.

336
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,280
我们为什么总是穿得这么正式
Why'd we do it, Dan? Dress up like that?

337
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,750
-别人都不会 -你还记得我的化装服吗
-No one else would.
-Yeah, but do you remember my costume?

338
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,020
满是乳胶的那件，难看死了
All that tight latex?
I mean, it was awful.

339
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,160
是啊，很难看
Uh.... Yeah, yeah, awful.

340
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,770
但是不想让“母亲”失望
But didn't wanna disappoint Mother.

341
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:21,930
她希望女儿也能像她一样，对抗坏人
Wanted her little girl to be just like her
and fight bad guys.

342
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,200
基恩・艾科特是我们见到的最好的人
I think the Keene Act was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

343
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,640
不过我们这样能活的更长
Well, we'll live longer anyway.

344
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,470
怎么了
What?

345
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:39,950
乔认为，除非他做些事情
Jon thinks, unless he can do something
about it...

346
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,820
否则将来会有核战争
...that there's gonna be nuclear war.

347
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,780
很快
Soon.

348
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,000
我不太懂，他说的净是些
But I don't know what to think.
I mean, it's all...

349
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,230
量子力学和平行现实之类的术语
...quantum mechanics
and parallel realities with him.

350
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,170
我从不知道他看到的世界是什么样子
I never even know
what universe he's actually seeing.

351
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,600
只是感觉他离我越来越远了
He just keeps getting further away
from me.

352
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,970
对别人也是
Everyone.

353
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,740
我甚至不知道他是否还在乎我
I can't even tell
if he actually cares about me anymore...

354
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,940
还是他假装在乎
...or if he's just pretending.

355
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:11,590
如果他能假装，说明他还在乎
If he's pretending, it means he cares.

356
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,320
等等，我来开门
Hold on, I'll get the door.

357
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,460
谢谢你，丹尼尔
Thanks, Dan.

358
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,860
-好了吗 -好了
-Got it?
-Yeah.

359
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:32,260
你吃饭的时候，总有政府人员护送你吗
You always get
a government escort to dinner?

360
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:37,040
只是为了防止我作出让这个国家最强大的武器难过的事情
They're making sure I don't do anything to
upset the country's most powerful weapon.

361
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,040
对不起
I'm sorry.

362
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,120
我邀请你吃饭叙叙旧，说说高兴的事
I invite you out to dinner to catch up
and have a few laughs...

363
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:47,850
但是最近没有多少让人高兴的事
...but there don't seem to be many laughs
around these days.

364
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,820
怎么能高兴得起来？喜剧演员死了
What do you expect?
The Comedian's dead.

365
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,930
劳丽，是你吗
Laurie? Is that you?

366
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,610
我以为你已经习惯这样旅行了
Thought you'd be used
to traveling that way by now.

367
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:49,270
没有，我讨厌乔瞬间传送我
Well, I'm not.
I hate it when Jon teleports me.

368
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:52,310
比坐飞行的马车要强
Well, it beats flying coach.

369
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,670
喝玛格丽塔吗
Margarita?

370
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,080
母亲，现在是下午两点
Mother, it's 2:00 in the afternoon.

371
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,220
还记得给我写信的那个人吗
Remember that guy
that writes me letters?

372
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,890
他寄给我一件重要的东西，蒂华纳圣经
He sent me an item of memorabilia.
It's a Tijuana bible.

373
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:12,230
在三四十年代出版的8页的色情漫画
This little eight-page porno comic
they did in the '30s and '40s.

374
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,430
-他寄给你这个？-很有价值，像古董一样
-He sent you this?
-Sure. They're very valuable, like antiques.

375
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,940
母亲，这很下流
Mother, this is gross.

376
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,370
我觉得是一种恭维
I think it's kind of flattering.

377
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,810
你为什么生气的时候，总是叫我母亲？
Why do you always call me Mother
when you're mad?

378
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:29,240
我知道你为什么来，我仍然能读懂思想
I know why you're here.
I can still read, you know.

379
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,250
我在报纸上看到了
I saw it in the paper.

380
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,820
今天就是艾迪・布莱克的葬礼
Eddie Blake's funeral is today.

381
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,620
他总算是把笑料抖出来了
Finally got his punchline, I guess.

382
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,930
-可怜的艾迪 -他对你那样你还同情他？
-Poor Eddie.
-Poor Eddie? After what he did to you?

383
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,160
劳丽，你还是个孩子
Oh, Laurie, you're still young.

384
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,870
你不明白
You don't know.

385
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,800
事情是会变的
Things change.

386
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,410
那已经是40年前的事了
What happened happened 40 years ago.

387
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,840
我已经67岁了
I'm 67 years old.

388
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:02,210
每一天，未来都会变得更阴暗一点
Every day, the future
looks a little bit darker.

389
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,210
但是过去
But the past...

390
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,710
就连肮脏的过去
...even the grimy parts of it...

391
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,890
变得越来越清晰
...keep on getting brighter.

392
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,230
闪着眼睛了
I've got spots in my eyes.

393
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,370
少来了，艾迪
Stop it, Eddie.

394
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,710
-谢谢你，维吉 -谢谢你，猫头鹰先生
-Thank you, Weegee.
-Thank you, Mr. Owl.

395
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,110
明天下午3点，到我工作室
Tomorrow, 3:00, my studio.

396
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,450
-21号去小地方 -好
-Little place on 21 st.
-Sounds good.

397
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:43,220
哇，真正的摄影会，真想看看我的头发会拍成什么样子
SALLY: Wow, a real photo session.
Wonder how my hair will look?

398
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:48,730
去吧，我五分钟以后到
Oh, go ahead. I'll be there in five.

399
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,240
艾迪
Eddie.

400
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,380
你来干什么，你知道我在换衣服
What the hell are you doing here?
You knew I was changing.

401
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,150
当然知道
Sure I did.

402
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,380
来吧，宝贝
Come on, baby.

403
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,820
我知道你需要什么
I know what you need.

404
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,060
你穿上这样的衣服是有原因的
You gotta have some kind of reason
for dressing in an outfit like this.

405
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,530
我说过不行，艾迪
I said no, Eddie.

406
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:31,070
-不行就等于同意 -不行就是不行
-No spelled Y-E-S.
-No spelled N-O.

407
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,680
-知道吗 -来吧，亲爱的
-All right?
-Come on, sweetheart.

408
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,210
艾迪
Eddie....

409
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,790
你这混蛋
You little bastard.

410
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,420
你喜欢这样？
This what you like?

411
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,090
-这让你兴奋？-什么
-This what makes you hot?
-What?

412
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,780
没有顺利的事，孩子
Things are tough all over, cupcake.

413
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:52,050
公平和不公平是同时存在的
It rains on the just and the unjust alike.

414
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:56,060
喜剧演员算是两者皆备
The Comedian was a little bit of both.

415
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:00,890
他总是认为他能笑到最后
And he always thought
he'd get the last laugh.

416
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:04,490
无所不知的上帝，我们心中的秘密
MAN: Thou knowest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

417
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,430
倾听我们的祷告
Shut not thy merciful ears
to our prayers...

418
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:13,200
宽恕我们，万能的主
...but spare us, Lord most holy,
O God most mighty...

419
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,440
仁慈的救世主
...O holy and merciful savior.

420
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,840
你永恒的判决
Thou most worthy judge eternal.

421
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,350
最后不要让我们受到伤害…
Suffer us not at our last hour
for any--

422
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:52,740
烟花，不会吧
EDDlE:
Fireworks. You gotta be kidding me.

423
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:57,640
这个国家怎么会有足够的烟花
You know, you'd think this goddamn
country had had enough fireworks.

424
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:01,140
如果我们在越南打败了
You know, if we'd lost here in Vietnam...

425
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:06,280
会把我们国家逼疯
...I think it might have driven us crazy.
You know, as a country.

426
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:10,750
但是没有打败，多亏了你
But we didn't, thanks to you.

427
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,660
听起来像是挖苦
You sound bitter.

428
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,490
我挖苦了吗？
Me? Bitter?

429
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:19,730
没有，我觉得很好笑
Fuck, no. I think it's hilarious.

430
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,910
天啊
Oh, Jesus Christ.

431
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,070
-艾迪先生 -正是我最不想看到的
-Mr. Eddie?
-Just what I fucking needed.

432
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:36,310
战争结束了，我们必须谈谈这个孩子
The war is over now.
We must talk about this baby.

433
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:40,610
没什么好谈的，我要离开了
There's nothing to talk about.
See, I'm leaving.

434
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:42,120
我要忘记你
I'm gonna forget about you...

435
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:45,120
还有这个烂国家
...and your horrible, sweaty,
little piece-of-shit country.

436
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:46,850
滚出去
Get the fuck out of here.

437
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,460
-不 -滚出去
-No.
-Get the fuck out of here.

438
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,000
你会记住的
You will remember.

439
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:56,500
你会记住我和我的国家
You will remember me and my country...

440
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:59,000
永远
...forever!

441
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,480
我的脸
My face!

442
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,840
布莱克，不要
Blake. Don't.

443
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:08,950
布莱克
Blake!

444
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,320
她怀孕了
She was pregnant...

445
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,320
你打死了她
...and you gunned her down.

446
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,760
是的
That's right...

447
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,870
你就在一边看着
...and you know what? You watched me.

448
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,030
你本可以把枪变成蒸汽，把子弹变成水银
You could have turned the gun to steam,
the bullets to mercury...

449
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,800
把瓶子变成雪花，但是你没有
...the bottle into goddamn snowflakes,
but you didn't, did you?

450
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:36,580
你对人类一点不在乎
You really don't give a damn
about human beings.

451
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,580
你渐渐失去了人情味，博士
You're drifting out of touch, Doc.

452
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,350
上帝保佑我们
God help us all.

453
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,650
卫生员
Medic!

454
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,660
神圣仁慈的救世主
MAN:
Most holy and merciful savior.

455
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,500
像花朵一样出来，又被割下
He cometh up and is cut down,
like a flower.

456
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:07,870
在生命的中间，我们在死亡里
In the midst of life, we are in death.

457
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,340
除了你，我们到哪里找到拯救？
Of whom may we seek succor,
but of thee, O Lord?

458
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,810
欢迎，我们很快就开始
Welcome. We'll be starting shortly.

459
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:22,080
我们再等一个人
We're waiting for one more.

460
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:36,200
我就说过，你不会是唯一穿着正式的人
I told you, you wouldn't be
the only one dressed up.

461
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,240
欢迎，博士
Welcome, doctor.

462
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,300
现在我们可以开始了
Now we can start.

463
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,310
欢迎前来，现熟悉一下这张高犯罪区域地图
Thank you for coming. Acquaint yourselves
with this map of high-crime areas.

464
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,810
这是胡说
This is all bullshit.

465
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:52,990
对于自称喜剧演员的人，我不知道你什么时候是在说笑话
For a guy who calls himself the Comedian,
I can never tell when you're joking.

466
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,560
守望者，这是真正的笑话
Watchmen. That's the real joke.

467
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:59,520
15年前不管用，今天也不会管用
It didn't work 15 years ago,
and it ain't gonna work now...

468
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,820
因为你们想扮演牛仔和印第安人
...because you wanna play
cowboys and lndians.

469
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,360
也许我们开会的时候应该禁止喝酒
Maybe we should agree
on no drinking at meetings.

470
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:09,900
我和罗夏合作，已经在黑帮的问题上取得了进展
Rorschach and I have made headway
on the gang problem by working together.

471
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:14,410
这种规模的队伍就像是作秀，我不会参加的
A group this size seems like
a publicity stunt. I'm not in it for the ink.

472
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,370
我们能做得更多
ADRlAN:
We can do so much more.

473
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,740
我们能拯救世界
We can save this world...

474
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:23,510
-只要有正确的领导 -是啊
-...with the right leadership.
-Yeah.

475
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,650
就是你来领导吧，奥西曼德斯
And that'd be you, right, Ozzy?

476
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:30,590
你是地球上最聪明的人
I mean, hell,
you're the smartest man on the planet.

477
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,420
只要不是傻子，都能看出世界有麻烦
It doesn't take a genius
to see the world has problems.

478
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,460
但是只有傻子才会认为应该由你来领导
But it takes a room of morons to think
they're small enough for you to handle.

479
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,130
你们
You people.

480
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,760
你听说摩洛回来了，把你们的内裤都拿走了
You hear Moloch's back in town,
get your panties all in a bunch.

481
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:45,770
-你觉得抓住他重要吗 -重要的是正义
-You think catching him matters?
-Justice matters.

482
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,170
正义
Justice.

483
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,800
我们都会面临审判的
Justice is coming to all of us.

484
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,450
不管我们在做什么
No matter what the fuck we do.

485
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:58,120
有史以来人类就在相互屠杀
You know, mankind's been trying to kill
each other off since the beginning of time.

486
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:03,120
现在我们终于有强大的武器来结束屠杀了
Now we finally have the power
to finish the job.

487
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,990
核武器一爆炸，什么都无所谓了，我们都会毁灭
Ain't nothing gonna matter once
those nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.

488
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,160
到时这位奥西曼德斯
Then Ozymandias here...

489
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,430
就会成为废墟里最聪明的人
...will be the smartest man
on the cinder.

490
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:10,690
守望者，警察，警察保护人民
Watchmen! Police!
Police to protect the people!

491
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:19,260
请注意，市民们，我们正维护秩序
DAN: Attention, citizens.
We are trying to maintain order.

492
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:23,870
你们必须离开街道，直到警察罢工结束
You must clear the streets
until the police strike is over.

493
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,200
没必要使用暴力
If you could--
Please, there's no need for violence.

494
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:32,270
我们正维护秩序，直到警察罢工结束
We are trying to retain order on the streets
until the police strike is over.

495
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:34,640
不滚回去就对你们不客气了
Crawl back in your holes
before you get hurt.

496
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:36,980
-我有橡胶子弹 -我要权利
-I got rubber bullets.
-I want my rights!

497
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,780
-你不是法律 -我们要正规警察
-You are not the law!
MAN 2: We want regular cops!

498
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,220
不要治安员
No more vigilantes!

499
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:44,950
我儿子就是警察，混蛋
My son's a police officer,
you fucking faggots!

500
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,360
该死的，你希望这样吗
Goddamn it. All right.
That's how you wanna do it?

501
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:02,770
没必要使用暴力
There's no need for violence.

502
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:06,070
去你的
Fuck you. Fuck you!

503
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,050
事态严重了
Oh, this is getting heavy.

504
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,880
我喜欢在美国本土工作，丹尼尔
Goddamn, I love working
on American soil, Dan.

505
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,480
自从伍德沃德和伯恩斯坦以来，就没这么爽过
Ain't had this much fun
since Woodward and Bernstein.

506
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,280
这样能保持多久
How long can we keep this up?

507
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:50,050
国会正在通过一项法令，禁止戴面具
Congress is pushing through some new bill
that's gonna outlaw masks.

508
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:51,490
我们没有几天了
Our days are numbered.

509
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:55,930
在此之前，就像你经常说的那样，我们是人们唯一的保护者
Until then, it's like you always say:
We're society's only protection.

510
00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:00,660
-谁伤害他们？-这还用说？他们自己
-From what?
-Are you kidding me? From themselves.

511
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,030
-混蛋 -喜剧演员，等等
-Son of a bitch.
DAN: No, Comedian, wait!

512
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,470
你的脏手不要碰我
Get your stinking hands off me.

513
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,110
我们是怎么了
What the hell happened to us?

514
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,750
美国梦是怎么了
What happened to the American dream?

515
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:21,420
美国梦是怎么了
What happened to the American dream?

516
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:23,720
实现了
It came true!

517
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,920
你现在看到的就是
You're looking at it.

518
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,850
埃德加・威廉・雅各比
Edgar William Jacobi.

519
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:33,850
也叫埃德加・威廉・沃恩，或者摩洛
Also known as Edgar William Vaughn.
Also known as Moloch.

520
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:40,880
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

521
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:43,250
我是个退休的商人
I'm a retired businessman--

522
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:48,390
再撒谎的话，摩洛，我就再折断你一根手指
Lie again, Moloch, I break another finger.

523
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,580
我服过刑了
I did my time.

524
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,560
我不再是摩洛了
I'm not Moloch anymore.

525
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,600
-你想让我干什么 -听说你参加了布莱克的葬礼，为什么
-What do you want from me?
-Heard you attended Blake's funeral. Why?

526
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:02,220
我只是觉得
I just felt I should...

527
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,310
应该去为喜剧演员送行
...pay my respects to the Comedian.

528
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:13,510
-你怎么知道他就是喜剧演员 -他曾闯进这里，一周之前
-How'd you know he was the Comedian?
-He broke in here. A week ago.

529
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,010
没有戴面具
He had his mask off.

530
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,980
-他喝醉了 -酒害了他几十年
-He was drunk.
-Enemies. For decades.

531
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:23,180
-他为什么来找你 -我不知道
-Why should he visit you?
-I don't know.

532
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,290
我在卧室醒来的时候，他就来了
I woke up in my bedroom
and there he was.

533
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,430
他很难过
He was upset.

534
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,520
他在哭泣
He was crying.

535
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:33,330
喜剧演员哭了？
Crying? The Comedian?

536
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:36,490
他胡言乱语
EDGAR:
He was babbling, not making any sense.

537
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:39,660
我吓得都尿了裤子
I was pissing in my pants.

538
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,140
我以为他会杀了我
I thought he was gonna kill me.

539
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:44,570
他说了什么
RORSCHACH:
What did he say?

540
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,540
这是个笑话
It's a joke.

541
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,840
完全是个笑话
It's all a fucking joke.

542
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:55,290
知道嘛,我原以为我知道呢
You know, I thought I knew how it was.

543
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,480
我以为我知道这个世界有多么的疯狂
I thought I knew how the world was.

544
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:02,290
我做了这么多坏事
I've done some bad things.

545
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,560
我对女人们做过坏事,我还杀过孩子
I did bad things to women. I shot kids.

546
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:09,000
就是在越南
In 'Nam, you know.

547
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,000
不过当时是战争
But that was fucking war.

548
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:13,300
而这件事
This....

549
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,640
我从没做过这样的事情
I never done anything like this.

550
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:22,250
我现在
God, here I am...

551
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:24,510
面对我的死敌
...spilling my guts...

552
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:26,480
说出我的心里话
...to one of my archenemies.

553
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,990
但是
But the truth is...

554
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:36,190
你又算是我最亲近的朋友，这话应该怎么说
...you're the closest thing to a friend I got.
What the fuck does that say?

555
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,300
该死
Shit.

556
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,500
你的名字
And your name...

557
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:48,200
你的名字在名单上
...your name was on the list...

558
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:52,710
和珍妮一起,也不知是不是她的真名
...along with Janey, you know,
whatever the fuck her name is.

559
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,310
曼哈顿以前的女朋友
Manhattan's old girl.

560
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,680
母亲,原谅我
Mother, forgive me.

561
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:04,520
然后他就离开了
EDGAR:
And then he left.

562
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:10,120
我发誓我不知道他到底在说什么
I swear I don't know
what the hell he was talking about.

563
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:18,840
有趣的故事
Funny story.

564
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:21,640
听起来不可信
Sounds unbelievable.

565
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:24,340
可能是真的
Probably true.

566
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:27,210
就这样了？
So that's it?

567
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:31,510
-没我事了吧？-你？
-I'm clean?
-You?

568
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,050
没你事？
Clean?

569
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:40,090
杏素
Amygdalin.

570
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,960
这是用杏仁做的假药
This phony medication
made from apricot pits.

571
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:46,360
-这是犯法的 -拜托了
-It's illegal.
-Come on.

572
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,570
求你别没收这个
Please don't confiscate that.

573
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:54,200
所有的药我都吃过了
I'm trying anything.

574
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,170
我得了癌症
I have cancer.

575
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:59,510
什么癌？
What kind of cancer?

576
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:04,440
你知道嘛,癌症也有良性的
You know the kind
you eventually get better from?

577
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:08,350
我的是恶性的
That ain't the kind I got.

578
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:15,550
罗夏日记 10月16号
Rorschach 's journal. October 16th.

579
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:18,560
想要吗？50块,我帮你口交
Want some of this?
Fifty bucks, I'll suck your cock.

580
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:21,530
我想到了摩洛的故事
-Thought about Moloch 's story.
-Come on.

581
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,640
可能是谎话连篇
Could all be lies.

582
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:28,100
他蹲大牢的时候就已经开始计划复仇了
A revenge scheme
planned during his years behind bars.

583
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:33,370
去你的,我一周赚的比你一年赚的都多
Fuck you. I make more in a week
than you make in a year, you fucking homo.

584
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:35,140
不过如果是真的
But if it's true...

585
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,580
什么能让喜剧演员
... what could have possibly
scared the Comedian...

586
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,620
吓得在摩洛面前哭？
...enough to cry in front of Moloch?

587
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:42,010
他到底看见了什么？
What was it he saw?

588
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:45,450
还有他提到的那个名单
And that list he mentioned.

589
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:53,030
爱德华・布莱克,喜剧演员

590
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,600
1918年出生

被谋杀
Murdered.

593
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:04,030
这就是我们身上发生的事情？
没有时间救朋友？
Is that what happens to us?
No time for friends?

594
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,140
只有敌人才会留下玫瑰
Only our enemies leave roses.

595
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:11,350
残忍的人被残忍的杀害
Violent lives ending violently.

596
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:18,380
布莱克对此很明了,人性本恶
Blake understood.
Humans are savage in nature.

597
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,260
不管如果掩饰
No matter how much you try
to dress it up...

598
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:23,560
如何伪装
... to disguise it...

599
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:26,860
布莱克看到了社会的真实面目

600
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:31,660
选择去模仿,做个小丑

601
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,500

一个人去看医生,说他得了抑郁症
Man goes to doctor, says he's depressed.

603
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:42,510
生活仿佛是如此的尖酸刻薄
Life seems harsh and cruel.

604
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:46,550
他觉得在这社会中,他是如此的孤独

in threatening world.

605
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,520
医生说:治疗办法很简单

606
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,360
最有名的小丑正在城里,去找他吧

Go see him.

607
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:56,520
他能让你开心起来
That should pick you up. "

608
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:59,970
他哭了起来
Man bursts into tears.

609
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:04,470
“可是,医生,我就是那个小丑啊”
"But doctor, " he says. "I am Pagliacci. "

610
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:08,200
不错的笑话
Good joke.

611
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,380
大家都笑了
Everybody laugh.

612
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:12,710
鼓点响起
Roll on snare drum.

613
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:14,700
大幕落下

614
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,420
你什么时候的采访
What time do you have to be
at your interview?

615
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:27,220
放心
JON:
Don't worry.

616
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:30,350
我们时间多的是
We've got plenty of time.

617
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,600
感觉就像舔着电池
Your finger's like licking a battery.

618
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:02,690
天啊,乔,停下来,你在干嘛？
God, Jon, stop. What are you doing?

619
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:04,190
别生气
Please don't be upset.

620
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:08,030
我一直以为你喜欢这样呢
I always thought you liked this.

621
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,600
不喜欢
LAURlE:
No.

622
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:14,070
我不喜欢,不喜欢
I don't-- No.

623
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:17,740
我不想这样
I don't want that.

624
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:21,180
我不知道怎么能引起你的激情了
I don't know
what stimulates you anymore.

625
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,950
听着,我知道你只是想…
Look, I know you were just trying--

626
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,220
我们上床的时候你也在工作？
Are you working in here
while we're in bed together?

627
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:34,830
我和阿德丽安的研究正在关键的时候
My work with Adrian
is at a critical stage right now.

628
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:38,460

-I didn't think it was necessary to--
-To what?

629
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:42,160
没必要告诉我是谁在和我上床？
To what? To tell me which one of you
is giving me a pity fuck?

630
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:53,750
当时我的注意力都在你身上
My attention was completely focused
on you.

631
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:56,610
如果你觉得我的态度有问题
If you think there's a problem
with my attitude...

632
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:59,010
可以和我谈谈
...I am prepared to discuss it.

633
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:04,520
你什么都知道，唯独不了解人
You know how everything in this world
fits together except people.

634
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:09,150
我对你来说是一个谜团吗
What am I to you?
Another puzzle to be solved?

635
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:13,030
让你的人后退,我现在把反应堆传送给卡纳克
Have your men stand back.
I'm teleporting the reactor to Karnak now.

636
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:16,800
你是我和世界唯一的连接了
You're my only remaining link
to the world.

637
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:27,170
我不想再承担这一责任了
I don't want that responsibility anymore.

638
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:35,180
把他交给你了
He's all yours.

639
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:43,590
别担心,乔,她会回来的
ADRlAN:
Don't worry, Jon. She'll be back.

640
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:47,260
不,她不会的
No, she won't.

641
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:05,910
人们对他有很多称呼：英雄、武器
MAN [ON TV] : He's been called

642
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,890

648
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,920
劳丽
LAURlE:

649
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:59,070
抱歉,我换了新锁
Sorry. I just had this new lock installed.

650
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,710
我只能来找你
I didn't know where else to go.

651
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,040
没事,进来吧
Oh, it's okay. Come in.

652
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:13,510
怎么了？
What's wrong?

653
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:16,450
我和乔分手了
I left Jon.

654
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,460
哦,天啊
Oh, God.

01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:24,660
我不知道为什么来这里
I don't know why I'm here. I just....

657
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,670
我不认识别的任何人
I don't know anybody else.

658
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,800
除了那些超级英雄们,我谁都不认识
I don't know anybody
except for goddamn superheroes.

659
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:35,040
没事的
That's okay.

660
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:37,470
你们可能就是吵架而已
You probably just had an argument
or something.

661
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,010
不是的,丹尼尔
No, Dan.

662
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:42,240
你不知道和他住一起是什么样的
You don't know what it's been like
living with him.

663
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:45,540
他看事物的眼神,仿佛是他根本不…
The way he looks at things now,
it's like he doesn't...

664
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,190
根本不记得任何东西一样
...remember what they are.

665
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,680
在这个真实的世界里
It's like this world, this real world...

666
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:54,660
对他来说,像是雾里穿行
...to him,
it's like walking through mist.

667
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:58,390
人们只是影子
And people are just shadows.

668
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:02,460
雾里的影子而已
Shadows in a fog.

669
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:06,940
神啊,事情怎么就这么复杂了？
God, how did everything
get so tangled up?

670
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:10,530
抱歉,丹
I'm sorry, Dan.

671
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,270
这是第二次毁了你美好的傍晚
This is twice now
I've ruined your evening.

672
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,710
拜托了,你来我这,我还巴不得呢
Come on. I'm glad you came over.

673
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:21,410
我正想去霍利斯那里喝点啤酒
I was just gonna see Hollis
for our weekly beer session.

674
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:23,580
你去的话非常欢迎
You're more than welcome to join.

675
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,060
其实是我想邀请你
In fact, I insist.

676
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,360
曼哈顿博士来了,却没一个人通知我一下
Terrific. Dr. Manhattan arrives
and no one thinks to tell me.

677
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:05,430
没时间化妆了
WOMAN: He just--
-We don't have time for makeup.

678
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,900
上电视的话,那个蓝色太浅了
That blue is too light for television.

679
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:12,660
现在够深了吧？
Is that dark enough?

680
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,380
是,是够深了
PRODUCER:
Yeah, that's dark enough.

681
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:21,210
世界的重担压在他身上，但他会逃避吗？不
MAN: The weight of the world's on him,
but does he quit? No.

682
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:23,650
新闻供应者永远会面对，他们是…
News vendors always cope. They're the--

683
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:27,380
天啊，那个流浪汉又来了
Oh, God, here comes
that homeless guy again.

684
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:30,620
我说过，这月的期刊还没有到
I told you, this month's issue
still hasn't arrived yet.

685
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:34,450
你为什么在乎右翼分子？那些混蛋才不在乎呢
Why do you care about that right-wing rag?
Those bastards don't give a damn.

686
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:38,130
等等，他们来了
Hold up. Here they come.

687
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:44,430
西摩
博尼,把戏练的怎么样了？
-Seymour.
-Bernie, how's tricks?

688
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:45,630
很好
BERNlE:
Fine, fine.

689
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:49,110
看见我后面这个人没？
都缠着我一整周了
See this guy behind me?
Been bugging me all week.

690
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:56,210
也许我们该打辆车，这一片治安不好
Maybe we should get a cab.
These are bad neighborhoods.

691
01:04:56,380 --> 01:05:00,010
我心情不好
Yeah, well, I'm in a bad mood.

692
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,860
有什么好戏看？
Girl.
What we got here?

693
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,900
这是五角大楼核准的不能涉及的几个话题
Here's a list of Pentagon-approved
no-go areas.

694
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:20,870
肯定会提到阿富汗问题,不要评论的过火
Afghanistan will obviously come up,
but just play it cool...

695
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,410
不要谈论过于敏感的话题
...and try not to get
into any tight corners.

696
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:27,270
著名核物理学家奥西曼德斯,经历过可怕的事故
--a renowned nuclear physicist,
who, through a terrible accident...

697
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:33,220
却因祸得福,获得超能力,能用意念来控制物体
...was gifted with extraordinary powers,
capable of bending matter to his will.

698
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:37,650
世人称他为曼哈顿博士
Today, the world knows him
as Dr. Manhattan.

699
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:39,160
欢迎
Welcome.

700
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,390
谢谢
JON:
Thank you.

701
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:47,500
对了
MAN 3:
That's right.

702
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,840
布莱克女士,你可以先发问了
Ms. Black, you have the first question.

703
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:58,440
曼哈顿博士,如你所知
Dr. Manhattan, as you know...

704
01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:01,310
“末曰之钟”象征着
...the Doomsday Clock
is a symbolic clock face...

705
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:05,040
人类接近毁灭的时间
...analogizing humankind's proximity
to extinction...

706
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:08,380
午夜代表了核战
...midnight representing the threat
of nuclear war.

707
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:11,720
现在的时间是午夜前四分钟
As of now, it stands at four minutes
to midnight.

708
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,830
您觉得我们正处在灭绝的边缘吗？
Would you agree that we're that close
to annihilation?

709
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:17,560
我父亲曾是个钟表匠
My father was a watchmaker.

710
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,730
自从爱因斯坦发现时间的相对性
他就放弃了这一工作
He abandoned it when Einstein discovered
that time is relative.

711
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:25,900
我只能说，一个象征意义的钟
I would only agree
that a symbolic clock...

712
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:28,060
对于智者的作用
...is as nourishing to the intellect...

713
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,510
如同一张氧气照片对于快淹死的人的作用
...as a photograph of oxygen
to a drowning man.

714
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:35,580
你的意思是，不存在什么危险？
So you're saying there is no danger.

715
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:39,740
即使没有核武器，世界仍然有危险
JON: Even in a world without nuclear
weapons, there would still be danger.

716
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:47,590
你是否同意很多人的观点
MAN:
And would you say, as so many claim...

717
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,520
说你实际上是个神
...that you are, in fact, a god...

718
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:52,530
因为你能同时看见过去和未来
...given you see the past
and future simultaneously?

719
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,000
我只能看见我自己的过去
I can only see my own past...

720
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:59,340
至于我的未来,我也不是什么都知道
...my own future. I am not omniscient.

721
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:01,310
罗斯,该你提问了
KOPPEL:
Doug Roth, your question?

722
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,210
说到您的过去,曼哈顿博士…
Speaking of your past, Dr. Manhattan...

723
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:07,140
您还记得叫沃利・韦沃尔的人吗？
...do you remember a man
named Wally Weaver?

724
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:12,450
是,我们都是吉拉研究基地的物理学家
Yes. We were both physicists together
at the Gila Flats Research Base.

725
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:14,510
他死于癌症
He died of cancer.

726
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:17,650
-他是个好人 -那么埃德加・雅各比呢
-He was a good man.
How about Edgar Jacobi...

727
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:20,730
也被称为大恶人摩洛
...also known as the supervillain Moloch?

728
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:25,790
在60年代你们见过几次面
You encountered him several times
in the '60s: battles, conflicts.

729
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,470
您是否知道他也得了癌症？
Did you know that he has cancer as well?

730
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,630
没人对我说过
I wasn't told.

731
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,030
那蓝道夫将军呢？
And what about
General Anthony Randolph?

732
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:36,640
您起初为政府工作时,他就是你的上司
He was your handler when you first
started working for the government.

733
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,070
也得了癌症
Cancer.

734
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:40,910
你是说我导致了癌症
You're suggesting I was the cause.

735
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:44,310
在我看来,这是毫无疑问的
From where I'm standing,
it's starting to look pretty conclusive.

736
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,510
即使这样，也是不相干的
JON:
Even if that's the case, it's irrelevant.

737
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:49,490
完好的人类身体,和受疾病侵袭的人类身体
A live human body
and a deceased human body...

738
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:51,750
都有着相同数量的微粒
...have the same number of particles.

739
01:07:54,490 --> 01:07:56,390
身体结构上没有什么不同
Structurally, there' s no difference.

740
01:07:57,530 --> 01:07:59,800
好的,请安静一下
All right. Let's settle down, please.

741
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:06,900
那珍妮・斯雷特呢？
What about Janey Slater?

742
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:10,010
你觉得她不一样？
You think it makes a difference to her?

743
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,410
珍妮？
Janey?

744
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:14,300
你的前女友
Your ex-girlfriend?

745
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:18,110
她也是个物理学家,你们已经认识11年了
She was a physicist too.
You saw each other for 11 years.

746
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:19,810
一次只能问一个问题
Doug, one question at a time.

747
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:23,350
她也患了癌症,医生说,她只有6个月可以活了
She has cancer as well.
Doctors have given her six months.

748
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,350
对吧,斯雷特小姐？
Isn't that right, Miss Slater?

749
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:42,670
乔,你曾是我的全部
You were the world to me, Jon.

750
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,510
你曾是我的生命
You were my whole life.

751
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:49,040
还记得你说过多少遍爱我吗？
Do you remember how many times
you said you loved me?

752
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,910
珍妮,我不知道你病了
Janey, I wasn't told.

753
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:56,750
事故之后我一直支持你,我给了全部
I stuck by you after the accident.
I gave you everything.

754
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,460
你就这样“报答”我？
This is how you repay me?

755
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:08,800
珍妮,我真的不知道
去你的吧,乔,上帝诅咒你
-Janey, I wasn't told. I didn't know.
-Damn you, Jon. Goddamn you.

756
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:10,960
珍妮,等等
Janey, wait.

757
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:14,810
结束了,访谈结束
-That's it. This interview is over.
-Get up there.

758
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:17,340
把摄像机关了,所有人后退
Get those cameras off.
Everybody back off.

759
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:21,210
所有人后退,我需要点后援,放开他
Everybody back off.
I need some backup here. Leave him alone.

760
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:27,480
拜托了,大家都各自散了吧
Please, if everyone
would just go away...

761
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:30,560
别来烦我
...and leave me alone....

762
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:32,120
你愿意发表评论吗？
Do you care to comment?

763
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:35,320
我说了,别来烦我
I said, leave me alone!

764
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:02,850
天啊
Jesus.

765
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,550
我们
Us...

766
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:08,290
被抢劫了
...getting mugged.

767
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:12,220
我们走
Let's go.

768
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:19,770
我很震惊
I'm shaking.

769
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:25,740
你知道吗
You know what?

770
01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:29,600
我累了，今天就这样吧
I'm wiped. I'm just gonna call it a night.

771
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:33,010
你真的不想和我一起到霍利斯那里吗
Oh, are you sure you don't wanna
come by Hollis' with me...

772
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:35,420
去消遣一下？
...and shake off the adrenaline?

773
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:39,350
今晚我已经见到足够的英雄行为了
LAURlE: I think I've had enough hero stuff
for one night.

774
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:42,860
你能倾听就很有帮助了
It helped having you listen.

775
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,890
我的荣幸
DAN:
Any time.

776
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,500
保重，丹尼尔
LAURlE:
Take care, Dan.

777
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:50,600
这是残酷的世界
It's a rough world out there.

778
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:53,270
再见
DAN:
Be seeing you.

779
01:10:57,610 --> 01:10:58,740
我们晚了
You're late.

780
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:02,010
我知道，你不会相信发生了什么事
Ah, I know. I know.
You won't believe what happened.

781
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:04,980
曼哈顿博士在电视直播中大发脾气
Dr. Manhattan just lost it on live TV.

782
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:06,850
等等，什么？
Wait, what?

783
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:14,360
我当时和劳丽在一起，她不知道
I was just with Laurie. She doesn't know.

784
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:18,760
她很快就会知道的，整个世界都会知道
HOLLlS: She's gonna know soon enough.
The whole world will know.

785
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:21,660
我说了,别来烦我
I said, leave me alone!

786
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:33,710
我正在抬头看星星
JON:
I am looking at the stars.

787
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:36,210
它们如此的遥远
They're so far away...

788
01:11:36,650 --> 01:11:39,310
发出的光经过这么多年才到达地球
...and their light takes so long
to reach us...

789
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:46,250
我们看见的星星,只是它们的老照片
...all we ever see of stars
are their old photographs.

790
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:53,700
1959年,7月,我恋爱了
It is July, 1959, and I am in love.

791
01:11:54,530 --> 01:11:56,200
太好了
MAN:
That' s great.

792
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:58,000
你明天过来拿吧 好的
-You can pick it up tomorrow.
-Okay.

793
01:11:58,170 --> 01:11:59,900
75美分 好的,谢谢你
-Seventy-five cents.
-Okay, thank you.

794
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:01,100
谢谢
Thank you.

795
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:05,470
惨了,乔,我真希望他能给点暗示
我肯定扮鬼脸了
Gosh, Jon, I wish he gave us a little notice.
I'm sure I made a face.

796
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:10,640
不用了,你肯定你很美
Oh, no, no.
I'm sure that you'll look beautiful.

797
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:16,890
她叫 珍妮 斯雷特
Her name is Janey Slater.

798
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:20,390
和我一样,她是个物理学家
She is a physicist, like me.

799
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:23,420
我那年30岁
I am 30 years old.

800
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:32,070
是我们大学校友沃利介绍的
We were introduced by a good friend
of mine from college, Wally Weaver.

801
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,800
1981年 2月12号
It is February 12th, 1981.

802
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:42,750
沃利死于癌症,现在他们说是我导致的
Wally dies of cancer,
of which they now say I am the cause.

803
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:03,130
那晚,我和珍妮第一次做爱
That night, Janey and I make love
for the first time.

804
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:13,970
一个月后,一场灾难等着我
A month from now,
the accident awaits me.

805
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:24,950
我会赶上你们的,我的手表落里面了
Oh, I'll catch up with you guys.
I think I left my watch inside.

806
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:27,860
我们等一会
Hey. Let's just wait a second.

807
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:35,670
我穿过了屋子,找到了手表
I cross the room to the
Intrinsic Field Center. I find my watch.

808
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:43,540
我到门口的时候
When I get to the door...

809
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:46,510
沃利脸都变白了
... Wally is turning white.

810
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:50,740
程序已经被锁定,定时器是打不开的
The program's locked in.
We can't override the time lock.

811
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:54,050
我害怕极了
I am terrified.

812
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:55,350
乔？
JANEY:
Jon?

813
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:02,360
抱歉,乔
I'm sorry, Jon...

814
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:05,860
我不能…
...but I can't--

815
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:09,660
珍妮,别离开我
Janey, don't leave me!

816
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,190
别离开我
Don't leave me!

817
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:49,000
1959年,5月12号,我和珍妮在别人的撮合下见面了
It is May 12th, 1959,
when I'm introduced to Janey.

818
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,640
她请我喝了杯啤酒
She buys me a beer...

819
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:54,680
第一次有女人请我喝啤酒
...the first time a woman
has done this for me.

820
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:59,880
她把凉凉的啤酒递给我时
As she passes me the cold,
perspiring glass...

821
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:01,750
我们的指尖接触了
...our fingers touch.

822
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:16,800
对,乔,好的
Yes, Jon, good.

823
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:22,470
下面就是如何按照正确的顺序，把零件再组装起来
Now it' s just a question of reassembling
the components in the correct sequence.

824
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:27,400
我最后一次
I feel fear...

825
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:30,780
感受到了恐惧
...for the last time.

826
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,030
举行了一场象征性的葬礼
A token funeral is held.

827
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,360
没有可以埋葬的遗体
There is nothing to bury.

828
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:55,130
珍妮把照片放在相框里
Janey frames the snapshot.

829
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:58,470
这是我唯一的照片
It's the only photograph of me
anyone has.

830
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:04,650
围墙外,是个循环系统
A circulatory system is seen
by the perimeter fence.

831
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:06,520
几天后
A few days later...

832
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:09,920
一个有部分肌肉的骨架站在了走廊里
...a partially muscled skeleton
stands in a hallway...

833
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:13,920
尖叫了一会就消失了
...and screams for a moment
before vanishing.

834
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:41,310
哦,神啊
Oh, God.

835
01:16:41,490 --> 01:16:43,010
乔？
Jon?

836
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:45,890
是你吗？
Is that you?

837
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,590
世界各国都从今早的消息中震惊了
Nations around the world
reeling from this morning's announcement...

838
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,390
或许是当代历史上最有名的事件
...possibly the most significant event
in recent history.

839
01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:56,630
重复一遍,超人的确存在,并且是个美国人
We repeat, the superman exists,
and he is American.

840
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:05,600
他们叫我曼哈顿博士
They call me Dr. Manhattan.

841
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:09,880
他们说取这个名字
They explain the name
has been chosen...

842
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:14,280
是为了对抗美国的敌人
...for the ominous associations
it will raise in America 's enemies.

843
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:22,220
策划人员说我需要一个商标
The marketing boys say I need a logo.

844
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,400
如果我要有一个标志的话
If I'm to have a symbol...

845
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:38,000
应该是我尊敬的
...it shall be one I respect.

846
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:51,080
他们把我塑造成华丽
They are shaping me
into something gaudy...

847
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,290
而又致命的武器
...something lethal.

848
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:01,620
1971年,1月
In January, 1971...

849
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:05,760
尼克松总统让我干涉越南战争
...President Nixon asks me to intervene
in Vietnam...

850
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:08,700
这是他的前任绝对不会要求的事情
...something that his predecessors
would not ask.

851
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:12,840
一周后,冲突结束了
A week later, the conflict ends.

852
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:17,450
一些越共军队想当面向我投降
Some of the Vietcong forces
wanna surrender to me personally.

853
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:24,480
霍利斯,退休的假面英雄,写了本书
Hollis Mason, a retired costume hero,
writes a book.

854
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:29,490
书里,他写到,我的降临就是超人时代的开始
In it, he calls my arrival
the dawn of the superhero.

855
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:33,060
我不知道这句话到底是什么意思
I am not sure if I know what that means.

856
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:52,640
当时，别人经常歪曲我的话
WALLY:
You see, at the time, I was misquoted.

857
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:55,980
我从来没说过“超人的确存在,并且是个美国人”
I never said, " The superman exists
and he is American. "

858
01:18:56,160 --> 01:19:02,120
我说的是: 神的确存在,而且是个美国人
What I said was, "God exists,
and he is American."

859
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:05,100
如果你对此感到紧张
Now, if you begin to feel an intense...

860
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:09,170
对这个概念感到宗教性的恐惧
...and crushing feeling of religious terror
at the concept...

861
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,630
不用惊慌
...don't be alarmed.

862
01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:16,300
这说明你仍然是正常人
That indicates only
that you are still sane.

863
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:21,910
1963年的圣诞节
It is Christmas, 1963.

864
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:25,950
珍妮说她很害怕,很担心
Janey tells me she is afraid, and worried.

865
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:29,380
说我现在像个神一样
She says I am like a god now.

866
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:32,250
我跟她说,我不信神的存在
I tell her I don 't think there is a God.

867
01:19:32,430 --> 01:19:35,050
就算真有，我也不是
And if there is, I'm nothing like him.

868
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:42,270
我对她说我依然爱她
I tell her I still want her...

869
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,030
永远都会
...and that I always will.

870
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:52,770
1970年 9月4号,我对她撒谎了
As I lie to her, it is September 4th, 1970.

871
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:56,480
我在一间屋子里,里面的人都带着面具
I am in a room
full of people wearing disguises.

872
01:19:57,950 --> 01:20:02,220
一个年轻女孩看着我,甜甜的笑着
A very young girl looks at me and smiles.

873
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:06,080
她真美
She's beautiful.

874
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:15,530
深吻之后,她又给了我一个小巧而又温柔的吻
After each long kiss, she plants a smaller,
gentler one upon my lips...

875
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:17,260
就像是个签名一样
...Iike a signature.

876
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:21,800
珍妮说我追求未成年少女
Janey accuses me of chasing jailbait.

877
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:27,580
她放声大哭,问是不是因为她变老了
She bursts into angry tears,
asking if it's because she's getting older.

878
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:29,580
她说的没错
It's true.

879
01:20:31,650 --> 01:20:34,680
她一日比一日更加苍老一起
She's aging more noticeably every day...

880
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:44,090
而我却驻足于此
...while I am standing still.

881
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:47,690
我更喜欢这样静止的地方
I prefer the stillness here.

882
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:50,760
我厌倦了地球
I am tired of Earth.

883
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,600
厌倦了这些人
These people.

884
01:20:53,170 --> 01:20:56,870
我厌倦了被卷入他们的生死中
I'm tired of being caught
in the tangle of their lives.

885
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:23,030
他们声称他们的努力是为了建造天堂
They claim their labors
are to build a heaven...

886
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:27,060
然而他们的天堂却处处弥漫着恐怖
...yet their heaven is populated
with horrors.

887
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:30,200
或许世界不是人造的
Perhaps the world is not made.

888
01:21:31,210 --> 01:21:33,200
任何东西都不是人造的
Perhaps nothing is made.

889
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:37,610
没有工匠的钟表
A clock without a craftsman.

890
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:40,540
太晚了
It's too late.

891
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:42,890
一直都是
Always has been...

892
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,720
以后也是
...always will be...

893
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:47,920
太晚了
... too late.

894
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,090
你完全不知道他去了什么地方
FORBES: And you have no idea
where he would've gone.

895
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:53,560
我怎么会知道
LAURlE:
How would I know?

896
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:56,460
也许在地球的另一端研究分子
Probably on the other side
of the world studying molecules.

897
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:59,160
我们的卫星扫遍了地球
FORBES: Our satellites have done
a sweep of the planet.

898
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:01,640
都找不到他的痕迹
There's no trace of his
energy signature anywhere.

899
01:22:01,810 --> 01:22:03,100
真的吗
Really?

900
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:06,680
朱庇特小姐，曼哈顿博士今天飞行了吗
Miss Jupiter, did you and
Dr. Manhattan have a fight today?

901
01:22:06,850 --> 01:22:08,340
不管你们的事
None of your fucking business.

902
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:11,850
你拿着政府的薪水，却没有履行职责
It is when you're on government payroll
and you're not doing your job.

903
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:16,490
你这样几乎等于说我是婊子了，福布斯特工
That's as close to the word "whore"
as you're gonna get with me, Agent Forbes.

904
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:26,120
抽烟吗
Smoke?

905
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:28,900
我道歉，朱庇特小姐
My apologies, Miss Jupiter.

906
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:32,440
你知道曼哈顿博士对我们的国防安全有多么重要
You know how important Dr. Manhattan
is to our national security.

907
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:35,270
你能理解我们的担心
You can imagine our concern.

908
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,970
我能理解
I can only imagine.

909
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:47,210
一旦核弹发射，什么都无所谓了，我们都会毁灭
EDDlE: Ain't nothing gonna matter once
those nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.

910
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:50,210
这位奥西曼德斯
Then Ozymandias here...

911
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:53,420
将成为废墟中最聪明的人
...will be the smartest man
on the cinder.

912
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:14,710
劳丽，劳丽・简
EDDlE:
Laurel? Laurel Jane?

913
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:18,050
你是萨丽・朱庇特的孩子
You're Sally Jupiter's kid.

914
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:21,180
你是喜剧演员吧
You're the Comedian, right?

915
01:23:21,390 --> 01:23:22,850
这身打扮可真酷
You were pretty cool in there.

916
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:27,390
你妈妈,她一直以来可都是选美冠军哦
You know, your mom, she was one
of the all-time champion beauties.

917
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:32,900
你的眼睛随她，甚至也有同样的痣
You got her eyes, you know.
You even have that same funny little mole.

918
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:35,270
别碰她
Take your hands off her.

919
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:37,530
宝贝，好久不见了
Hey, doll. Long time no see.

920
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:41,300
我不这样认为, 艾迪,上车
Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
Get in the car.

921
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,870
你就没有点道德底线吗
Are there no depths you won't sink to?

922
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:48,880
神啊,难道跟…
Jesus Christ, Sally.
Can't a guy talk to his...

923
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:51,280
老朋友的女儿说话犯法？
...you know, old friend's daughter?

924
01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:53,580
你把我看成什么人了
I mean, what the hell do you think I am?

925
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:55,410
我们找到他了
MAN:
We found him!

926
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:00,550
-我们找到他了 -在哪儿
-We found him.
FORBES: Where is he?

927
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,290
火星
Mars.

928
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:13,330
总统先生
Mr. President...

929
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:18,140
苏联人的坦克已经快开到阿富汗边境
...the Soviets have moved their tanks
just short of the Afghan border.

930
01:24:19,710 --> 01:24:20,940
他们是想看看
They are testing us...

931
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:25,520
我们是否编造了曼哈顿博士的失踪
...to see if we manufactured
Dr. Manhattan's disappearance...

932
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:28,780
来引诱他们采取行动
...to coax a move out of them.

933
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:32,910
如果他们发现不是引诱，很可能就会开始空袭了
If they realize it's not a hoax,
they'll probably start with air strikes.

934
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:37,150
几天之内就会控制阿富汗
If they do, they'll have Afghanistan
under control in a matter of days.

935
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:42,260
核科学家监督小组已经把把“末曰之钟”
A watchdog group of nuclear scientists
has moved the Doomsday Clock...

936
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:44,670
设定在午夜前两分钟
...to two minutes until midnight.

937
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:48,000
不要放了
NlXON:
Get this shit off the screen.

938
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:51,200
当末日邻近的时候，这些混蛋怎么说
Who are these assholes to say
when doomsday approaches?

939
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:53,850
我认为末日邻近的时候
I say when doomsday is approaching.

940
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,110
那么
Now, then.

941
01:25:02,150 --> 01:25:04,650
其他的华约组织国家呢
What about the rest
of the Warsaw Pact countries?

942
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:09,020
捷克斯洛伐克，波兰和东德已经动员了军队
Czechoslovakia, Poland and East Germany
have mobilized their forces.

943
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:12,360
但是还没有行动，他们是在静观其变
But no movement yet.
They're playing a wait-and-see.

944
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:14,160
让苏联人带头
Letting the Russians take the lead.

945
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:21,700
我们现在应该采取大胆的行动
Bold moves, Henry.
That's what's needed right now.

946
01:25:21,870 --> 01:25:24,640
不能让这些混蛋认为我们懦弱
We can't let these fuckers
think we're weak.

947
01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:29,080
他们必须害怕疯子尼克松
Yes. They must fear the madman
Richard Nixon.

948
01:25:34,150 --> 01:25:37,610
先发制人的话,我们至少得多长时间才能准备好？
How soon can we be ready
for a preemptive strike?

949
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:39,820
2天
Two days.

950
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:44,090
我们有54%的把握，在苏联发射导弹以前
We have a 54 percent chance
of wiping out the entire U.S.S.R...

951
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:46,320
就消灭整个苏联
...before they get their missiles airborne.

952
01:25:47,930 --> 01:25:49,530
我们的损失呢
What would our losses be?

953
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:51,570
如果保守估算
Assuming conservative projections...

954
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:55,100
我们能提前摧毁的苏联核弹头的数量
...of how many Soviet warheads
are destroyed beforehand...

955
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:57,140
我们将失去整个东海岸
...we'll lose all of the East Coast.

956
01:25:57,580 --> 01:25:59,100
哈佛集团
The last gasp...

957
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:02,450
要完蛋了
...of the Harvard establishment.

958
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:06,150
看看他们怎么躲过核袭击
Let's see them think their way
out of fission.

959
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:09,910
根据目前探测的风向,核污染尘埃会向南飘
With anticipated wind patterns,
the fallout drift would head south.

960
01:26:10,090 --> 01:26:12,280
墨西哥要倒霉了
Mexico would catch the worst of it.

961
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:14,550
多数农业区不会遭受影响
Most of the farm belt
might remain unaffected.

962
01:26:14,730 --> 01:26:16,420
不算太糟
Not so bad...

963
01:26:17,230 --> 01:26:19,360
整体考虑的话
...all things considered.

964
01:26:21,930 --> 01:26:23,770
总统先生
GENERAL 2:
Mr. President...

965
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:25,560
您意下如何
...what would you like to do?

966
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:36,210
把战备等级提高到二级
Take us to DEFCON two.

967
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:38,370
为轰炸机加油
Begin fueling the bombers.

968
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:41,890
曼哈顿博士有两天的时间…
Dr. Manhattan has two days.

969
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,120
在这之后
After that...

970
01:26:44,290 --> 01:26:47,920
人类就不在我的掌握范围之内了
...humanity is in the hands
of a higher authority than mine.

971
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:51,500
希望他会站在我们这边
Let's just hope he's on our side.

972
01:26:52,730 --> 01:26:54,820
-肯定有办法联系到他 -对不起
FORBES: There must be a way to reach him.
LAURlE: Excuse me.

973
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,660
无线电广播，航天飞机
FORBES:
Radio transmission, space shuttles--

974
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:58,060
-对不起 -怎么了
LAURlE: Excuse me.
FORBES: What?

975
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:00,540
我要去一下洗手间
LAURlE:
I need to use the restroom.

976
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:23,720
你不明白吗
Don't you understand?

977
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:26,520
我能把乔找回的只有他的人
The only thing that can
bring Jon back is Jon.

978
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,660
如果他想找到我，他会的
If he wants to find me, he will.

979
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:31,300
我已经坐了足够长的监狱
I've been a prisoner in my life
long enough.

980
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:33,360
没有曼哈顿先生
MAN:
Without Dr. Manhattan around...

981
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:36,440
来阻止苏联发动战争的话，维特先生
...to bully the Russians into peace,
Mr. Veidt...

982
01:27:36,610 --> 01:27:41,010
人们会需要那种老式的能源
...people are going to need good,
old-fashioned energy to rely on.

983
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:42,840
你能理解的
You can understand.

984
01:27:43,010 --> 01:27:48,110
世界不可能一下子就离开石油和核能
The world can't just quit on oil
and nuclear power cold turkey.

985
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,510
你会一夜之间毁了我们的整个经济
You'll dismantle
our entire economy overnight.

986
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:53,450
你说的没错,李,为什么能源要免费
You're right, Lee. And why free energy?

987
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:56,520
“免费”相当于社会主义了
Well, "free" is just another word
for "socialist."

988
01:27:56,690 --> 01:27:58,660
我们得做个民意调查
We might have to
make a public inquiry...

989
01:27:58,830 --> 01:28:02,090
看看你过去和共产主义者有多少联系
...into any past communist affiliations
you might have had.

990
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:05,370
洛卡先生，先生们
ADRlAN:
Mr. Iacocca, gentlemen...

991
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:08,770
我尊重你们的身份
...I respect your position...

992
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:12,840
以及你们作为企业家所赢得的成就
...and what you've accomplished
as captains of industry. I do.

993
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:15,730
你们想知道我的过去？
You wanna know my past? Hm?

994
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:19,280
好的，乐意回答
Okay. Happily.

995
01:28:19,450 --> 01:28:22,910
档案里记录着，我17岁的时候父母双亡
It's a matter of public record that by 17,
both my parents were dead...

996
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:24,920
留下我一个人
...Ieaving me alone.

997
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:29,290
可以说我一直都是孤身一人
I guess you could say
I've always been alone.

998
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:34,360
人们常说我是世上最聪明的人,而我却时常觉得很愚蠢
They say I'm the smartest man in the world,
but the truth is I've often felt stupid...

999
01:28:34,530 --> 01:28:38,020
无法与任何人建立关系
...at being unable to relate to anyone.

1000
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:41,600
与活着的人建立关系
Well, anyone living, that is.

1001
01:28:41,770 --> 01:28:43,740
唯一让我感觉亲近的人
The only person
with whom I felt kinship...

1002
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:47,030
早在公元前300年就去世了
...died 300 years
before the birth of Christ.

1003
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:52,580
马其顿王亚历山大，也就是亚历山大大帝
Alexander of Macedonia,
or Alexander the Great, as you know him.

1004
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:55,770
他的天下一统的设想
His vision of a united world was....

1005
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:00,780
是前无古人的
Well, it was unprecedented.

1006
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,650
我想
I wanted...

1007
01:29:02,830 --> 01:29:05,120
我需要达到他那样的成就
...needed to match
his accomplishments...

1008
01:29:05,290 --> 01:29:08,490
所以我决定把古代的原理应用于现代
...so I resolved to apply antiquity's
teachings to our world today.

1009
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:12,160
开始我的征服之路
And so began my path to conquest.

1010
01:29:12,330 --> 01:29:15,570
并不是征服人类
Conquest not of men...

1011
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:18,570
而是征服困扰人类的邪恶力量
...but of the evils that beset them.

1012
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:23,710
矿物燃料,石油,核能
Fossil fuels, oil, nuclear power...

1013
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:26,710
就像是毒品一样,而你们和外国集团
...are like a drug, and you,
along with foreign interests...

1014
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,510
-就是毒品贩子 -听我说
-...are the pushers.
-Now, listen.

1015
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:30,710
不
ADRlAN:
No.

1016
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:34,850
你听我说
You listen.

1017
01:29:36,090 --> 01:29:38,580
世界会存活下去
The world will survive...

1018
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:42,230
它需要的不是你们能提供的
...and it deserves more
than you've been able to provide.

1019
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,990
我们就直接谈重点吧
So let's cut to it, shall we?

1020
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:47,740
我比你们所有的公司加起来都要值钱
I'm worth more
than all of your corporations combined.

1021
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:51,500
我能买卖你们三次，好好考虑这一点
I could buy and sell you, something
you should factor into your decision...

1022
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:57,980
再决定是否公开我们的分歧
...should you choose
to make our disagreement public.

1023
01:29:59,450 --> 01:30:01,880
我觉得你应该知道解决方案的
I think you know the way out.

1024
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:05,350
先生们
Gentlemen.

1025
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:11,350
玩具部门想和你谈谈奥西曼德斯系列产品的新恶人形象
The toy people wanna talk to you about
new villains for the Ozymandias line.

1026
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:14,990
-看来老恶人都死了 -维特先生
-Seems all the old villains are dead.
-Mr. Veidt?

1027
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:18,730
-我有一些设想 维特先生？
-I think I have some ideas.
-Mr. Veidt?

1028
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:21,700
看来我们首次合作并不顺利
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

1029
01:31:00,710 --> 01:31:02,400
他含着毒药胶囊
He's got a poison capsule.

1030
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:07,540
别咬破,混蛋,谁派你来的,说！
Don't bite down, you son of a bitch.
Who sent you? I want a name.

1031
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:08,810
谁派你来的？
Give me a name!

1032
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:22,220
自杀毒药
LAURlE:
Suicide pill.

1033
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:26,270
氰化钾,还没倒地就死了
Potassium cyanide.
Guy was dead before he hit the ground.

1034
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:28,260
多谢了
WAlTRESS:
Thanks, hon.

1035
01:31:28,770 --> 01:31:30,790
看来罗夏说的对
Then Rorschach was right.

1036
01:31:30,970 --> 01:31:33,130
并非某一个疯子
This wasn't some lone nut.

1037
01:31:33,310 --> 01:31:37,440
背后有组织,装备良好,资金充足
It's an organization:
well-funded, well-equipped.

1038
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:40,350
可是谁想除掉我们？
But who'd wanna kill us now?

1039
01:31:41,650 --> 01:31:44,780
我不知道,不过这里不安全
I don't know, but it's not safe out here.

1040
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,290
没有乔的消息？
So no word from Jon?

1041
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:54,890
没有
No.

1042
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:57,160
听着…
Well, listen...

1043
01:31:57,660 --> 01:31:59,360
到我那里住吧
...why don't you come stay with me?

1044
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:03,690
谢谢你的好意,不过我不想成为负担
Oh, no.
That's sweet, but I wouldn't wanna impose.

1045
01:32:04,170 --> 01:32:07,540
不是,就当帮我的忙
Oh, no. No.
Think of it as doing me a favor.

1046
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:11,710
这样我就不用担心你一人在外了
I wouldn't have to worry about you
being out there.

1047
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:16,340
那好吧
Okay.

1048
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:24,860
罗夏日记,1985年 10月21号
Rorschach's journal, October 21st, 1985.

1049
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:29,120
在第43和第7街交叉口,看见丹尼尔和朱比特共进晚餐
On 43rd and 7th, saw Dreiberg
and Jupiter leaving diner.

1050
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:32,460
我不戴面具,他们认不出来我
They didn 't know me without my mask.

1051
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:34,960
他们有私情？
An affair?

1052
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:39,070
难道她伤了曼哈顿的心？甩了曼哈顿
Did she break Manhattan 's heart
to engineer his exile...

1053
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:41,170
为丹尼尔腾位子？
...make room for Dreiberg?

1054
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:44,800
曼哈顿有没有心能为她碎呢？
Does Manhattan even have a heart
to break?

1055
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:48,840
小巷阴冷,荒芜
The alley was cold, deserted.

1056
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:53,610
我的东西就在原来放的地方,在等着我
My things were where I left them,
waiting for me.

1057
01:32:53,790 --> 01:32:58,160
我的外套,鞋,干净的手套
My coat, my shoes, my spotless gloves.

1058
01:32:59,690 --> 01:33:01,630
我的脸
My face.

1059
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:05,800
穿上,我放弃了我的伪装
Putting them on,
I abandoned my disguise...

1060
01:33:05,970 --> 01:33:08,090
成为我自己
...became myself.

1061
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:11,700
摆脱恐惧和软弱
Free from fear or weakness...

1062
01:33:11,870 --> 01:33:12,960
或贪欲
...or lust.

1063
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:16,410
在小巷里
Down alley...

1064
01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:18,440
听到女人的尖叫
...heard woman scream.

1065
01:33:18,610 --> 01:33:22,610
城市晚间合唱的第一个注解
First bubbling note
of city's evening chorus.

1066
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:24,580
一起强奸
A ttempted rape.

1067
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:25,910
抢劫
Mugging.

1068
01:33:26,090 --> 01:33:27,550
都是
Both.

1069
01:33:29,060 --> 01:33:30,750
那个人转过身
The man turned...

1070
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:34,050
眼神中有一种肯定
...and there was something
rewarding in his eyes.

1071
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:37,500
有时夜晚对我很慷慨
Sometimes the night is generous to me.

1072
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:47,940
暗杀维特的人就是个当地的痞子,叫洛伊・德斯
Veidt's assassin was a local lowlife
named Roy Chess.

1073
01:33:48,510 --> 01:33:51,270
在他的公寓里,我有了线索
A t his apartment, I found clues.

1074
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:55,540
貌似他在金字塔跨国公司工作
Seems he worked
at Pyramid Transnational.

1075
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:58,280
我以前就见过这个图标
I've seen the logo before...

1076
01:33:58,690 --> 01:34:00,740
在摩洛的家里
...at Moloch 's.

1077
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:34,050
今天有人想谋害天下第一聪明人,摩洛
Someone tried to shoot
the world ' s smartest man today, Moloch.

1078
01:34:34,890 --> 01:34:37,690
就是那个在金字塔跨国公司工作的人
Guy worked for Pyramid Transnational.

1079
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:39,990
我觉得应该不仅仅是送货服务吧
More than a just delivery service,
I take it.

1080
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:44,100
我上次来的时候,看见了这个公司签的一张养老金支票
Last time I was here, I saw a pension check
written from the same company.

1081
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:47,760
我觉得这是想让我们死的人对我们宣战
I'm guessing it's a front set up
by whoever wants us masks dead.

1082
01:34:47,930 --> 01:34:51,530
别再撒谎了,摩洛,到底谁开的金字塔公司？
Now, no more lies, Moloch.
Who runs Pyramid?

1083
01:34:56,410 --> 01:34:58,040
罗夏
FlNE [OVER BULLHORN] :
Rorschach.

1084
01:34:58,210 --> 01:35:00,580
警察,我们知道你们在里面
This is the police.
We know you're in there.

1085
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:02,610
不,不
No. No!

1086
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:05,910
如果有人和你在一起,赶紧放了他
If there's anybody in there with you,
send them out unharmed.

1087
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:09,020
不,不
No. No, no, no!

1088
01:35:09,190 --> 01:35:13,590
正中圈套,真蠢到家了
Framed. Walked right into it.
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

1089
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:15,390
永远不要投降
Never, never surrender.

1090
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:18,550
好了,我希望你已经准备好了
All right.
I hope you're ready, hero.

1091
01:35:18,730 --> 01:35:19,760
随时奉陪
When you are.

1092
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:43,480
一
One...

1093
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:49,550
二
...two...

1094
01:35:53,570 --> 01:35:54,630
三
...three.

1095
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:48,380
赶紧
Come on.

1096
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:00,630
龟儿子
MAN:
Son of a bitch.

1097
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,000
-天啊,他真臭 -把他的面具摘了
-Christ, he stinks.
-Get that mask off him.

1098
01:37:04,170 --> 01:37:07,000
我摘下来了 不,不
-I got it.
-No. No!

1099
01:37:07,170 --> 01:37:09,870
我的面具,把我面具还我
My face! Give me back my face!

1100
01:37:10,710 --> 01:37:13,340
带面具的罗夏已经被逮捕
The masked vigilante Rorschach
was apprehended...

1101
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:17,350
并证实身份,是一个35岁的白人男性,名叫沃特 卡文斯
...and identified
as Walter Kovacs, a 35-year-old white male.

1102
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:20,580
大家对沃特知道的少之又少,不过他被指控谋杀艾德加・雅各比
Little 's known about Kovacs,
but he was charged with the murder...

1103
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:24,590
后者在布朗克斯区的家中被枪杀
...of Edgar Jacobi, found shot in the head
in his home in the Bronx.

1104
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:27,780
在抓捕行动中
Police officers were injured
and Jacobi's home was set ablaze...

1105
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:30,520
…警方官员受伤,雅各比的家被大火烧毁
...during the violent course
of the capture.

1106
01:37:34,330 --> 01:37:35,630
罗夏
MAN 1 :
Rorschach!

1107
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:39,530
你祖宗十八代不得好死
I ' m gonna fuck you
like I fucked your mother!

1108
01:37:46,180 --> 01:37:49,110
给我出来,罗夏
MAN 2:
Come on out, Rorschach!

1109
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,510
沃特 卡文斯
MAN 3:
Walter Kovacs.

1110
01:37:51,690 --> 01:37:54,550
你叫沃特？
Is that your name? Walter?

1111
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:58,780
我来跟你说说你现在的状况
Well, let me explain
your situation here, Walter.

1112
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:00,520
你要是好好合作的话
You cooperate with me...

1113
01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:05,190
我说不定能说服他们让你去看医生
...and I may be able to convince them
that you should be treated medically.

1114
01:38:05,370 --> 01:38:08,930
你现在的情况,能去医院看看最好不过了
In a hospital. I believe
that would be good for you.

1115
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:15,130
不过当局想把你和普通犯人关在一起
But the authorities wanna put you
with the general population.

1116
01:38:16,010 --> 01:38:19,070
监狱就是监狱 是啊,的确
-Prison's a prison.
-Uh-huh. Yes.

1117
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:23,120
不过差别就是,在这里
But the difference is, down there...

1118
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:25,050
你会被别人生吞活剥了
...you'd be eaten alive.

1119
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:30,250
监狱的很多人,都和你有瓜葛,沃特
You're responsible for a lot of them
being in prison here, Walter.

1120
01:38:33,330 --> 01:38:34,790
告诉我你看见了什么？
Tell me what you see.

1121
01:38:39,970 --> 01:38:41,630
漂亮的蝴蝶
A pretty butterfly.

1122
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,270
现在呢？现在看见了什么？
What about now? What do you see here?

1123
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:53,440
妈妈？
Mom?

1124
01:38:53,810 --> 01:38:55,180
他伤害了你没？
Is he hurting you?

1125
01:38:55,350 --> 01:38:58,220
你竟然还有个孩子,我家里也有
You got a fucking kid in here.
I get that at home.

1126
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:01,910
混蛋,当初都不该生你
Bastard.
I should have had that abortion.

1127
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:13,500
漂亮的花儿们
Some nice flowers.

1128
01:39:19,210 --> 01:39:20,870
我听说他老妈是个妓女
BOY 1 :
I heard this guy's mom 's a whore.

1129
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:25,910
她是不是把性病传染给你了？
Did you catch any diseases from her?

1130
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:30,880
嗯？妓女的儿子,听我说
Huh? Whoreson. Listen to me, retard.

1131
01:39:32,190 --> 01:39:35,420
你觉得,我给她一块钱,她会不会给我口交？
BOY 2: Hey, you think she'd suck my dick
for a dollar?

1132
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:55,170
云彩
Clouds.

1133
01:40:00,110 --> 01:40:02,840
跟我说说罗夏,好吗,沃特？
Tell me about Rorschach.
Will you do that, Walter?

1134
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:06,540
你一个劲叫我沃特,我不喜欢你
You keep calling me Walter.
I don't like you.

1135
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:11,820
你不喜欢我,那好吧,为什么
You don't like me.
All right, why is that, exactly?

1136
01:40:11,990 --> 01:40:13,360
你是个大胖子
You're fat.

1137
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:17,090
有钱人,对自由敏感
Wealthy. Liberal sensibilities.

1138
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:19,250
你称之为同情
What you call compassion.

1139
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:21,730
想保护和理解犯人
Wanting to protect
and understand the guilty.

1140
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:25,800
这个腐烂的社会,所谓的改造
This rotting society,
what it calls rehabilitation.

1141
01:40:25,970 --> 01:40:27,440
简直可以说是妥协
Nothing short of compromise.

1142
01:40:27,610 --> 01:40:30,170
为你好也是妥协吗
Is it a compromise
to want to make you well?

1143
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:34,580
这里有其他比我行为更极端的人,医生
There are other men in here with behavior
more extreme than mine, doctor.

1144
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:38,220
当然,他们不出名,不是吗
Of course, they're not famous, are they?

1145
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:41,310
你想了解罗夏？
You wanna know about Rorschach?

1146
01:40:42,790 --> 01:40:44,550
我来跟你说说罗夏的事
I'll tell you about Rorschach.

1147
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:48,350
当一个人看见了社会的阴暗面
Once a man has seen society's
black underbelly...

1148
01:40:48,530 --> 01:40:51,160
决不会置之不理
...he can never turn his back on it.

1149
01:40:51,330 --> 01:40:53,930
决不会像你一样,假装
Never pretend, like you do...

1150
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:58,430
并不存在,不管谁命令他换一种方式看
...that it doesn't exist, no matter who
orders him to look the other way.

1151
01:40:58,710 --> 01:41:02,270
我们这么做
We don't do this thing...

1152
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:04,540
不是因为得到允许
...because it's permitted.

1153
01:41:05,180 --> 01:41:07,740
而是因为我们必须做
We do it because we have to.

1154
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,750
因为我们是被迫的
We do it because we're compelled.

1155
01:41:12,590 --> 01:41:15,020
我正在调查一项绑架案
I was investigating a kidnap case.

1156
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:18,620
布莱尔 洛奇
Blaire Roche.

1157
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:22,230
6岁的女孩 我那时很年轻
Six-year-old girl. I was young then.

1158
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:25,430
对罪犯过于手软
Too soft on criminals.

1159
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:27,990
我让他们活命了
I let them live.

1160
01:41:29,270 --> 01:41:35,000
折了一个人的手,才得到的线索
我找到了失踪女孩的地点
Broke a man 's arm to get a tip.
Led me to the missing girl's location.

1161
01:41:42,620 --> 01:41:45,050
我知道那个女孩在那
I knew the girl was here...

1162
01:41:45,220 --> 01:41:48,750
不过搜了一圈,什么也没找到
...but when I searched the place,
I saw nothing.

1163
01:41:49,620 --> 01:41:52,060
然后就发现她了
And then I found her.

1164
01:42:41,410 --> 01:42:43,270
弗雷德
MAN:
Fred.

1165
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:45,970
巴尼
Barney.

1166
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:48,880
怎么不叫了
Who's gonna bark for Daddy?

1167
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:57,590
杀人犯回来的时候,天已经黑了
It was dark when the murderer got back.

1168
01:42:59,330 --> 01:43:00,920
如同他的阴暗一样
As dark as it gets.

1169
01:43:39,570 --> 01:43:44,430
神啊,谁在外面？谁啊？
Oh, God.
Who's out there? Who is it?

1170
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:47,370
谁？
Who is it?

1171
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:01,520
什么鸟玩意儿？你是谁？
What? What the fuck?
Who the fuck are you?

1172
01:44:01,690 --> 01:44:06,180
你想干嘛？你弄死了我的狗
What the fuck do you want?
You killed my dogs, man!

1173
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:15,730
你觉得我和那个女孩的死有关系？
我发现了她而已
You think I had something to do
with that girl? I found that.

1174
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:18,370
你有什么证据？这什么都不算
What evidence have you got?
That's nothing.

1175
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:29,080
好,我认罪
Okay. I confess.

1176
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:32,980
我绑架了她,杀了她
I kidnapped her. I killed her.

1177
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:35,150
逮捕我吧
Arrest me.

1178
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,680
怎么了？逮捕我吧
What? Arrest me!

1179
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:41,260
我犯的罪,是我
I did it! I said I did it!

1180
01:44:41,430 --> 01:44:42,860
神啊
Christ.

1181
01:44:43,030 --> 01:44:47,330
我有麻烦了,把我抓进去吧,我需要帮助
Look, I've got a problem, man.
Fucking take me in. I need help.

1182
01:44:48,130 --> 01:44:54,870
别,别这样,别
No, don't. Don't do that.
Take me in. Don't! No!

1183
01:44:59,850 --> 01:45:03,340
人都是要被逮住
Men get arrested.

1184
01:45:03,370 --> 01:45:05,400
狗也免不了一死
Dogs get put down.

1185
01:45:14,110 --> 01:45:16,280
我的手被震的直颤
Tremors of impact shook my arm.

1186
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:20,020
温暖的血液溅到我脸上
Warm blood splashed my face.

1187
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:25,350
过去的沃特已经随着那个女孩的死而消失了
Whatever was left of Walter Kovacs
died that night with that little girl.

1188
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:28,590
从那时起,就只有罗夏了
From then on, there was only Rorschach.

1189
01:45:29,650 --> 01:45:32,410
看,不是神要了那个女孩的命
See, doctor, God didn't kill that little girl.

1190
01:45:32,890 --> 01:45:37,050
不是命运不让她活,也不是宿命让她葬身为狗食
Fate didn't butcher her
and destiny didn't feed her to those dogs.

1191
01:45:38,230 --> 01:45:41,660
如果上帝看见那天晚上的事,看来他也不介意
If God saw what any of us did that night,
he didn't seem to mind.

1192
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:45,400
从那时起,我开始明白
From then on, I knew:

1193
01:45:46,730 --> 01:45:49,070
不是上帝让世界变成这样
God doesn't make the world this way.

1194
01:45:51,070 --> 01:45:52,560
是我们
We do.

1195
01:45:58,950 --> 01:46:01,310
我不能帮他
I can't help him.

1196
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:15,170
嘿,罗夏
Hey, Rorschach.

1197
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:18,170
你现在出名了,是吧？
Hey, you're pretty famous, right?

1198
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:20,810
罗夏,我听说你老妈是个妓女
MAN 1 : Rorschach, I heard your mother
was a whore.

1199
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:24,540
知道嘛,我现在也很出名呢
Hey, you know what?
I'm pretty famous too.

1200
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:27,250
对不对？当然是对的了
-Ain't that right? That's right.
MAN 2: That's right.

1201
01:46:28,890 --> 01:46:33,120
或许能给你个签名,你觉得怎么样？
Maybe I can give you an autograph.
What you say, big boy?

1202
01:46:47,340 --> 01:46:50,900
你们都不明白,我们关在一起不是我的不幸
None of you seem to understand.
I'm not locked in here with you.

1203
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:53,170
够了,够了
OFFlCER:
All right, that's it!

1204
01:46:54,020 --> 01:46:56,450
是你们的不幸
You're locked in here with me.

1205
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:16,260
劳丽
DAN:
Laurie!

1206
01:48:17,470 --> 01:48:18,800
糟了
Shit.

1207
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:21,700
等等 我操
DAN: Hold on.
-Fuck.

1208
01:48:24,970 --> 01:48:26,460
我来,让我来
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1209
01:48:31,150 --> 01:48:34,550
真抱歉,我可能按错了按钮
I'm so sorry. I was snooping
and must have hit the wrong button.

1210
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:36,150
你受伤没？没呢
-Are you hurt?
-No, no.

1211
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:39,410
那就好 我没事,真对不起
-Okay.
-I'm fine. I just feel so bad.

1212
01:48:39,590 --> 01:48:41,580
没事,别担心
No, don't worry.

1213
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:45,060
发生过这样的事,喜剧演员在77年就干过
It's happened before.
Comedian did it back in '77.

1214
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:47,990
差点把阿基害死
Archie survived that.

1215
01:48:48,430 --> 01:48:49,760
阿基？
LAURlE:
Archie?

1216
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:53,960
阿基米德的简称
Oh. Well, uh, short for Archimedes...

1217
01:48:54,140 --> 01:48:55,660
马林最喜欢的猫头鹰
...Merlin's pet owl.

1218
01:48:56,770 --> 01:48:58,430
蠢蠢的名字
Stupid nickname.

1219
01:48:59,510 --> 01:49:02,240
你怎么买的起这些东西的？
LAURlE: How did you ever afford
all this stuff, anyway?

1220
01:49:02,410 --> 01:49:07,940
呃,我父亲死后,给我留了大笔遗产
Well, my dad was in corporate banking
and left me a lot of money when he died...

1221
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:12,020
我都没想到,我是说,他以前
...which always surprised me.
I mean, he was....

1222
01:49:12,690 --> 01:49:15,320
我觉得他对我当警察很失望
I think he was disappointed
I went into crime fighting...

1223
01:49:15,490 --> 01:49:17,190
觉得我应该继承他的事业
...instead of following him.

1224
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:24,960
不过我对鸟类,航天飞机和神话更感兴趣
Guess I was just more interested in
birds and airplanes, mythology and....

1225
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:29,390
而且也有很多和我志同道合的人
Plus, there were enough other guys
doing this so that I didn't feel ridiculous.

1226
01:49:30,310 --> 01:49:31,530
比如霍利斯
Like Hollis.

1227
01:49:31,710 --> 01:49:33,200
对
Yeah.

1228
01:49:33,980 --> 01:49:36,740
是啊,他曾是我的偶像
Yeah, he was my hero.

1229
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:41,180
记得我第一次见到他的时候
Man, I remember the first time
that I met him...

1230
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:44,990
就很有亲切感
...I just felt so connected, you know?

1231
01:49:45,150 --> 01:49:47,490
很有共同之处
To something that mattered.

1232
01:49:50,330 --> 01:49:52,990
有秘密身份肯定感觉很不错吧
Must be nice having a secret identity.

1233
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:55,820
还有个任何人都不知道的机密地方
A secret place that nobody knows about.

1234
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:00,990
你到下面来玩,不会有人检查你
You can just come down here and hang out
without anyone checking up on you.

1235
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:04,800
没有人会注视你
Nobody watching you.

1236
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:09,200
想穿上试试吗
Wanna try those on?

1237
01:50:19,990 --> 01:50:21,650
试试吧
There we go.

1238
01:50:24,830 --> 01:50:26,820
哇,这太酷了
Wow, these rock.

1239
01:50:29,670 --> 01:50:31,960
这能放大光谱
They amplify the spectral range.

1240
01:50:32,130 --> 01:50:34,260
红外视图
Thermal imaging.

1241
01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:37,930
黑暗中效果更好
They work even better in the dark.

1242
01:50:42,850 --> 01:50:44,610
你能看见我,是吧？
You can see me, right?

1243
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:49,440
什么都能看见
I can see everything.

1244
01:50:52,190 --> 01:50:55,680
我记得,不管外面有多黑
I remember, no matter how black it got...

1245
01:50:56,030 --> 01:51:00,160
只要我戴上这个眼镜,一切又如同大白天一样清晰可见
...whenever I looked through those goggles,
everything was as clear as day.

1246
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:04,800
这肯定也是乔眼中的世界了
This must be the way Jon sees the world.

1247
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:10,140
我们吃饭吧,都快凉了
We should probably head up.
Food's getting cold.

1248
01:51:10,370 --> 01:51:12,470
玩好了,把眼镜放回原处
Put those away when you're done.

1249
01:51:21,450 --> 01:51:23,780
联合国苏联大使,没有评论
MAN [ON TV] : Soviet ambassador
to the U.N. had no comment...

1250
01:51:23,950 --> 01:51:26,220
曼哈顿博士的失踪
...when asked if Dr. Manhattan 's
disappearance...

1251
01:51:26,390 --> 01:51:28,720
是否促使苏联入侵阿富汗
...has fueled Soviet aggression
in A fghanistan.

1252
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:30,590
丹尼尔
Dan.

1253
01:51:31,330 --> 01:51:33,060
乔看见很多东西
Jon sees a lot of things...

1254
01:51:35,460 --> 01:51:37,760
不过他看不见我
... but he doesn ' t see me.

1255
01:51:44,910 --> 01:51:46,430
呃…
Well, uh....

1256
01:52:04,660 --> 01:52:06,220
哦
Oh.

1257
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:41,390
抱歉
Sorry.

1258
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:44,730
过来
Come here.

1259
01:52:50,670 --> 01:52:51,930
怎么了？
What's the matter?

1260
01:52:52,110 --> 01:52:54,540
如果你能稍微动一下…
好的
-lf you could just move a little....
-Okay.

1261
01:52:54,710 --> 01:52:56,940
好的,弄好了
Yeah. There you go.

1262
01:53:03,450 --> 01:53:06,080
丹,怎么了？
Dan, what's wrong?

1263
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:08,880
抱歉,我
Sorry, l....

1264
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:13,260
我得安静一小会
Yeah, I just need a couple minutes.

1265
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:17,370
惨了
Oh, hell.

1266
01:53:19,130 --> 01:53:20,970
不要紧
It's okay.

1267
01:53:22,370 --> 01:53:26,810
也许我们移动的太快了
Maybe we were just moving too fast.

1268
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:33,010
我们时间多的是
We've got all the time in the world.

1269
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,510
我们慢一点
We'll take it slow.

1270
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:52,830
好久不见了,罗夏
It's been a long time, Rorschach.

1271
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:54,990
“大块头”
RORSCHACH:
Big Figure.

1272
01:53:55,340 --> 01:53:57,170
世界可真小啊
Small world.

1273
01:53:58,510 --> 01:54:00,000
我喜欢这样
I like that.

1274
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:03,180
不过你得知道,在这,冤家路窄
But you know, it is a small world in here.

1275
01:54:03,610 --> 01:54:06,380
我已经在这呆了…多久了,罗伊德？
And I've been in it for,
how long now, Lloyd?

1276
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:08,680
大概15年了
LLOYD:
Almost 1 5 years, Mr. Figure.

1277
01:54:09,020 --> 01:54:10,350
没错
That's right.

1278
01:54:11,350 --> 01:54:14,850
15年前,你和猫头鹰把我抓进来
Fifteen years since you
and that Owl fella put me away.

1279
01:54:17,860 --> 01:54:19,020
那么
So...

1280
01:54:19,530 --> 01:54:24,300
罗夏,你烫伤的那个人已经快活不成了
随时都能上西天
...Rorschach, that guy you burned is dying.
Could go any minute.

1281
01:54:24,470 --> 01:54:29,670
据我统计,这里有50多号人是你抓进来的
You know, by my count, there are more
than 50 people in here that you put away.

1282
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:34,170
我已经跟他们都谈过了
大家都恨不得整死你
I been talking to every one of them
and they're all dying to get a piece of you.

1283
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:37,640
这地方要炸开锅了
This place is gonna explode!

1284
01:54:39,210 --> 01:54:41,880
接着,你就一点点死去
Then, you die by inches.

1285
01:54:42,820 --> 01:54:44,480
做梦吧
Tall order.

1286
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:47,210
我要把他扯碎
I'm gonna tear this guy a new hole.

1287
01:54:47,890 --> 01:54:50,880
别激动,劳伦斯,快了
Relax, Lawrence. Soon.

1288
01:54:51,730 --> 01:54:53,060
走吧
Come on.

1289
01:56:21,580 --> 01:56:22,910
丹？
Dan?

1290
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:31,420
没事吧？
Is everything all right?

1291
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:36,700
我厌倦了担惊受怕
I'm tired of being afraid.

1292
01:56:37,770 --> 01:56:40,130
害怕战争
Afraid of war...

1293
01:56:40,940 --> 01:56:44,500
害怕面具杀手
...afraid of the mask killer...

1294
01:56:46,110 --> 01:56:49,310
害怕这该死的衣服
...and afraid of this goddamn suit...

1295
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:51,450
以及我是多么需要它
...and how much I need it.

1296
01:56:52,280 --> 01:56:53,940
我也是
Me too.

1297
01:56:55,450 --> 01:56:56,750
那就让他们见鬼去吧
So to hell with it.

1298
01:56:57,620 --> 01:56:58,950
我们带阿基出去吧
Let's take Archie out.

1299
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:06,020
你不是开玩笑的吧？
You're serious.

1300
01:57:06,190 --> 01:57:08,720
我以前也是面具复仇手,没忘吧？
I used to be a masked avenger too,
remember?

1301
01:57:08,900 --> 01:57:12,130
我以前也是半夜3点出去,做一些愚蠢的事
I'm used to going out at 3 in the morning
and doing something stupid.

1302
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:15,960
所有单位,听候指示
MAN [OVER RADlO] :
Rapid burner. Be advised, all units.

1303
01:58:16,130 --> 01:58:18,690
格兰特大街和第五大街处失火
Tenement fire at 5th and Grand.
Rapid burner.

1304
01:58:18,870 --> 01:58:20,200
走吧
Let's go.

1305
01:58:24,970 --> 01:58:27,340
我能看见,好的,抓紧了
LAURlE: I can see it.
DAN: All right, hold on.

1306
01:58:38,190 --> 01:58:39,620
丹,这里面还有孩子
LAURlE:
Dan, there are kids in there.

1307
01:58:39,790 --> 01:58:41,950
所有人,呆在原地,不要慌张
Everyone, stay where you are
and remain calm.

1308
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:44,320
我们会救你们出来的
We're gonna get you out of there.

1309
01:58:44,490 --> 01:58:46,650
房顶要塌了,送我过去
The roof's starting to cave.
Get me in there.

1310
01:58:46,830 --> 01:58:48,300
我送你过去
DAN:
I'm gonna get you close.

1311
01:59:47,060 --> 01:59:48,420
走吧
Let's go.

1312
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:49,750
快
Come on.

1313
01:59:49,930 --> 01:59:51,520
大家快点
All right, let's move it, people.

1314
01:59:58,270 --> 02:00:03,070
妈妈,在宇宙火箭里的那个人
Mom, is that guy in the space rocket...?

1315
02:00:03,510 --> 02:00:05,740
是耶稣吗
Is that Jesus?

1316
02:00:05,910 --> 02:00:07,740
不,孩子
No, baby.

1317
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:10,770
小心点,好的
DAN: Watch your step.
LAURlE: All right.

1318
02:00:13,110 --> 02:00:14,140
都准备好了
We're all set.

1319
02:00:15,180 --> 02:00:16,840
都齐了吗？
Is that everyone?

1320
02:00:40,910 --> 02:00:43,210
拜拜 拜拜
MAN: Bye.
GlRL: Bye!

1321
02:00:46,820 --> 02:00:48,370
真不相信我们成功了
LAURlE:
I can't believe we did that.

1322
02:00:50,350 --> 02:00:52,820
他们会把我们和罗夏关在一起
管他呢
-They'll lock us up with Rorschach.
-Who cares?

1323
02:00:52,990 --> 02:00:54,960
明天第三次世界大战就要开始了
World War lll could start tomorrow.

1324
02:00:57,060 --> 02:00:58,390
对吧？
Right?

1325
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:01,390
对
Right.

1326
02:03:26,510 --> 02:03:28,410
过来
MAN:
Come back here!

1327
02:03:31,010 --> 02:03:32,710
他死了,罗夏
He's dead, Rorschach.

1328
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:37,080
大家都在忙着逃命呢,我却来给你带
乔迁礼物
While everyone's distracted, we thought
we'd bring you a housewarming gift.

1329
02:03:37,250 --> 02:03:39,410
机械店买来的
Something from the machine shop.

1330
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:42,680
嘿,头儿,你注意到没？
Hey, boss, you notice?

1331
02:03:42,860 --> 02:03:45,880
他不再废话连篇了
None of that "small world,
tall order" crap.

1332
02:03:46,060 --> 02:03:49,290
他知道一旦我们把他的门锁砸烂
下一个去西天的就是他了
He knows once we slice open his lock,
he's next on the block.

1333
02:03:49,730 --> 02:03:50,860
没门
Fat chance.

1334
02:03:51,570 --> 02:03:52,690
你死定了,罗夏
You're dead, Rorschach!

1335
02:03:52,870 --> 02:03:56,530
这个监狱里都是我们的杀手
你有什么？
We got a prison full of killers out here.
What do you got?

1336
02:03:59,470 --> 02:04:01,910
你的双手
不客气
Your hands, my pleasure.

1337
02:04:03,910 --> 02:04:05,900
我无法靠近门锁,要把铁窗砍了吗
LLOYD:
Can't reach the lock. Should I cut the bars?

1338
02:04:06,080 --> 02:04:09,380
暴乱不会持续多久,我等了15年就等今天了
This riot won't last.
I been waiting 1 5 years for this.

1339
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:13,890
抱歉,劳伦斯,你挡了我的复仇之路了
I'm sorry, Lawrence, but you're in the way
of my revenge.

1340
02:04:17,590 --> 02:04:19,320
不是针对你才这样的,大块头
Nothing personal, big guy.

1341
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:22,750
头儿,等等
Boss! Wait!

1342
02:04:36,910 --> 02:04:38,710
你该清楚现在的比分了吧
Now you find out what the score is.

1343
02:04:39,150 --> 02:04:42,280
1比0,进来杀我啊
One-nothing. Come and get me.

1344
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:49,980
快点
Come on.

1345
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:51,790
我一直在想
DAN:
So I've been thinking.

1346
02:04:52,730 --> 02:04:56,890
应该对我们的朋友有义务
I feel that we have an obligation
to our fraternity.

1347
02:04:57,730 --> 02:05:00,790
我觉得我们应该去救罗夏
什么？
-I think we ought to spring Rorschach.
LAURlE: What?

1348
02:05:00,970 --> 02:05:02,730
有人陷害他了
DAN:
Someone set him up.

1349
02:05:03,570 --> 02:05:07,170
还有乔造成癌症,简直说不通
And this whole cancer thing with Jon,
it just doesn't make sense.

1350
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:09,280
你还不明白
You didn't get it.

1351
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:12,010
是啊,不过想进入戒备森严的监狱
Yeah, but breaking
into a maximum-security prison...

1352
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:15,840
和灭火简直不是一回事
嗯,你说的没错
-...is a little different than putting out a fire.
-Yeah, you're right.

1353
02:05:16,750 --> 02:05:18,580
会更有趣
It'll be more fun.

1354
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:25,750
快点,罗伊德,我想看看这个龟儿子怎么被烧焦的
Hurry, Lloyd. I wanna
smell this son of a bitch cooking.

1355
02:05:31,030 --> 02:05:32,760
遵命
Yes.

1356
02:05:37,510 --> 02:05:38,530
不
No.

1357
02:05:52,450 --> 02:05:57,290
不要踩到厕所的污水,多明显的事
Never disposed of sewage
with a toilet before. Obvious, really.

1358
02:05:58,130 --> 02:06:01,430
2比0,该你出招了
Two-nothing. Your move.

1359
02:06:04,770 --> 02:06:06,390
让开
BlG FlGURE:
Get out of the way!

1360
02:06:50,410 --> 02:06:51,970
不,不
No. No.

1361
02:06:52,610 --> 02:06:54,010
我的面具在哪？
Where's my face?

1362
02:06:56,550 --> 02:06:58,280
别杀我
Don't kill me.

1363
02:07:01,960 --> 02:07:03,360
该你了,医生
Your turn, doctor.

1364
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:06,720
告诉我,你看见什么了？
Tell me, what do you see?

1365
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:34,610
别动
Don't move!

1366
02:08:42,890 --> 02:08:44,650
罗夏
Rorschach.

1367
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:47,960
丹尼尔,朱庇特女士
Daniel. Miss Jupiter.

1368
02:08:48,130 --> 02:08:51,530
抱歉,去趟厕所
Excuse me. Have to visit men's room.

1369
02:08:52,070 --> 02:08:54,030
哦,神啊
Oh, for chrissake.

1370
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:33,370
很高兴看见你穿上制服,丹尼尔
RORSCHACH:
Good to see you in uniform, Daniel.

1371
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:36,980
早就应该想到,需要一双美腿才能说服你
Should've known all you needed
was nice pair of legs to motivate you.

1372
02:09:37,150 --> 02:09:41,380
-你真是混球,罗夏 -原谅我的愤怒
LAURlE: You're such an asshole, Rorschach.
-Spare me indignation.

1373
02:09:42,620 --> 02:09:45,640
对乔不忠很难过
Picked hell of a time
to be unfaithful to Jon.

1374
02:09:45,820 --> 02:09:48,620
是厌倦爱国了,还是别人说服你了？
Get tired of being patriotic,
or someone put you up to it?

1375
02:09:48,790 --> 02:09:51,450
你不知道你在说什么
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!

1376
02:09:51,630 --> 02:09:55,490
能不能住口？你们可以以后再吵
Hey! Would you two stop?
You can argue later.

1377
02:09:55,660 --> 02:09:59,390
我必须把它关掉,这样我们很快就会吸引火力
I had to turn the screechers off,
so we'll be drawing fire soon.

1378
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:05,770
停！否则就开枪了
Stop! Stop or we will shoot!

1379
02:10:44,650 --> 02:10:46,770
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

1380
02:10:48,220 --> 02:10:50,410
没,只是…
Yeah. Just...

1381
02:10:50,850 --> 02:10:52,110
有点沉重,你知道吧？
...heavy, you know?

1382
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:55,010
战争,越狱
War, jailbreak.

1383
02:10:55,560 --> 02:11:00,430
别担心,一切会好起来的
Don't worry about it. Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.

1384
02:11:05,430 --> 02:11:08,460
你好,劳丽
乔
-Hello, Laurie.
-Jon.

1385
02:11:08,640 --> 02:11:12,270
电视上说你们在火星上呢
我是在火星上
-TV said you were on Mars.
-I am on Mars.

1386
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:15,240
我要和你在这好好聊聊
You and I are about
to have a conversation there.

1387
02:11:15,410 --> 02:11:16,880
你说什么？
What are you talking about?

1388
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:19,710
你要努力说服我来拯救这个世界
You're going to try to convince me
to save the world.

1389
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:28,610
劳丽,不要
丹,相信我
-Laurie, don't.
-Dan, trust me.

1390
02:11:28,790 --> 02:11:30,450
我得走了
I have to go.

1391
02:11:36,130 --> 02:11:38,120
真是美,不是吗？
Beautiful, isn't it?

1392
02:11:42,970 --> 02:11:45,910
原谅我,有些事情总是在我脑海里闪过
Forgive me. These things sometimes
slip my mind.

1393
02:11:47,310 --> 02:11:49,140
不会再发生了
It won't happen again.

1394
02:11:50,810 --> 02:11:52,800
真宽慰
LAURlE:
That's comforting.

1395
02:11:55,150 --> 02:11:56,810
哦,神啊
Oh, my God.

1396
02:11:57,490 --> 02:11:59,320
我在火星上
I'm on Mars.

1397
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:07,190
-屁股不错 -嘿,混蛋
MAN: Hey. Nice ass.
WOMAN: Hey, asshole.

1398
02:12:07,360 --> 02:12:09,960
我们看看那个漫画白痴在不在
MAN: Hey, let's see if that comic-book
retard's up here.

1399
02:12:10,770 --> 02:12:12,700
嘿,你
Hey, hey, hey. Yo.

1400
02:12:12,870 --> 02:12:17,570
都听见了吗？某个超级猫头鹰带着罗夏越狱了
You all hear? Some super-owl dude
just busted Rorschach out of prison.

1401
02:12:17,740 --> 02:12:19,470
-罗夏？-是的
-Rorschach?
-Yeah.

1402
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:21,510
这个笨蛋让我的表哥坐在轮椅上
That fool put my cousin in a wheelchair.

1403
02:12:21,680 --> 02:12:24,540
你指的是黑夜猫头鹰,他和罗夏曾是搭档
You mean Nite Owl.
Him and Rorschach used to be partners.

1404
02:12:24,710 --> 02:12:27,370
-是的 -也许他也招惹你表哥了
-Yeah.
-Maybe he messed your cousin up too.

1405
02:12:27,550 --> 02:12:29,780
-他是不是写了一本书？-是的
-Didn't he write a book or something?
-Yeah.

1406
02:12:29,950 --> 02:12:33,820
他住在附近的一个车库里
You know, he lives over a garage
right near here.

1407
02:12:33,990 --> 02:12:36,650
-是吗 -现在也是吗
-Yeah?
-Does he, now?

1408
02:12:39,390 --> 02:12:40,550
喂
SALLY [ON PHONE] :
Hello?

1409
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:43,550
萨丽
HOLLlS:
Sally?

1410
02:12:43,730 --> 02:12:46,630
-霍利斯？-对
-Hollis?
-Yeah.

1411
02:12:46,900 --> 02:12:50,800
霍利斯・梅森,天啊
Yes, Hollis Mason. Jesus.

1412
02:12:51,610 --> 02:12:56,240
你一直有我的电话,你等到晚年才用它？
All this time you've had my number and
you wait until our sunset years to use it?

1413
02:12:56,410 --> 02:12:59,210
那是个特殊场合,萨丽
HOLLlS: Well, it seemed like
a special occasion, Sal.

1414
02:12:59,380 --> 02:13:00,510
什么
What?

1415
02:13:00,680 --> 02:13:04,910
电视上报道,昨晚一处公寓失火
The TV is reporting there was
a tenement fire last night.

1416
02:13:05,790 --> 02:13:08,580
困住的人被飞船救了
There were trapped people
rescued by airship...

1417
02:13:08,760 --> 02:13:14,320
他们说飞行员打扮得像猫头鹰
...and they say the pilot
was dressed like an owl.

1418
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:16,690
好像还有个性感女人和他在一起
And it seems he had
a sexy woman with him.

1419
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:19,460
劳丽？我女儿劳丽？
Laurie? My daughter, Laurie?

1420
02:13:21,070 --> 02:13:24,200
我忘不了劳丽穿上制服的样子
I can't get over Laurie back in costume.

1421
02:13:24,370 --> 02:13:27,830
也许她最终会感谢我让她做这一行
Maybe she'll finally thank me
for getting her started in the first place.

1422
02:13:28,010 --> 02:13:31,600
萨丽,从你的声音看
You know, Sal,
by the sound of your voice...

1423
02:13:31,780 --> 02:13:33,510
你越来越年轻了
...you're sounding younger than ever.

1424
02:13:33,680 --> 02:13:35,980
上帝保佑你,霍利斯
Oh. Why, bless you, Hollis.

1425
02:13:36,650 --> 02:13:38,680
但可能是你老糊涂了
But that's probably just senility.

1426
02:13:41,460 --> 02:13:44,390
和你说话很愉快,劳丽
Well, it's been great talking to you, Sal...

1427
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:46,920
不过有人来了
...but someone's knocking.

1428
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:52,460
回忆从前的时候不要太悲伤
SALLY: Well, don't get too misty-eyed
thinking about old times.

1429
02:13:53,330 --> 02:13:55,170
你保重,霍利斯
You take care now, Hollis.

1430
02:13:55,340 --> 02:13:56,630
你也是
Ah, you too.

1431
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:58,030
再见
Bye.

1432
02:13:58,610 --> 02:14:00,100
再见
Bye.

1433
02:14:03,540 --> 02:14:05,840
我们找猫头鹰先生
MAN 1 :
We're looking for Mr. Owl.

1434
02:14:06,710 --> 02:14:08,910
等等
Yeah. Hold your horses.

1435
02:14:09,080 --> 02:14:10,640
猫头鹰先生,你在吗
MAN 1 :
Mr. Owl, you there?

1436
02:14:11,220 --> 02:14:12,620
不请客就捣乱
MAN 2:
Trick or treat.

1437
02:14:14,220 --> 02:14:15,810
你退休就不该再出来了,猫头鹰
MAN 1 :
You should've stayed retired, Owl.

1438
02:15:21,060 --> 02:15:22,610
我讨厌这样
RORSCHACH:
I hate this.

1439
02:15:22,790 --> 02:15:27,020
藏在洞里,躲着当局
Cowering in cave,
hiding from authorities.

1440
02:15:27,260 --> 02:15:30,460
警察在追捕我们,除非你想回到监狱
Cops are out there hunting us.
Unless you wanna go back to prison...

1441
02:15:30,630 --> 02:15:33,100
暴露自己是很愚蠢的
...we'd be stupid to expose ourselves
without a plan.

1442
02:15:33,270 --> 02:15:35,530
那应该怎么办
And what would that be?

1443
02:15:35,870 --> 02:15:39,570
等我们建立一个模式
Once we've established a pattern...

1444
02:15:39,970 --> 02:15:42,100
我们就能进入金字塔,看看能找到什么
...we can break into Pyramid,
see what we find.

1445
02:15:42,280 --> 02:15:44,710
做过了,没有用
RORSCHACH:
Did that. Dead end.

1446
02:15:44,880 --> 02:15:49,480
我觉得这只是某人用来掩饰的挂名公司,但是无法证明
I think it's a front company for whoever's
really behind it, but can't prove it.

1447
02:15:52,420 --> 02:15:56,750
我们应该摧毁地下联系人,压榨群众
We need to hit up underworld contacts,
squeeze people.

1448
02:15:56,920 --> 02:15:59,650
当然了,为什么不直接从电话薄里挑人呢？
Sure, why don't we just pick names
out of a phone book?

1449
02:15:59,830 --> 02:16:01,950
你忘了我们的做事原则了,丹尼尔
You forgot how we do things, Daniel.

1450
02:16:02,130 --> 02:16:06,590
你心太软了,特别是对女人,过于信任她们
You've gone too soft. Too trusting.
Especially with women.

1451
02:16:06,770 --> 02:16:08,860
好的,听着,我自己能处理好
Okay, no. Listen, I've had it with that.

1452
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:11,060
你以为你是谁,罗夏？
God, who do you
think you are, Rorschach?

1453
02:16:11,240 --> 02:16:13,330
你侮辱群众,脱离群众
You live off people
while insulting them...

1454
02:16:13,510 --> 02:16:17,310
没有人怪罪下来,因为大家都把你当个疯子看
...and no one complains because they think
you're a goddamn lunatic.

1455
02:16:29,290 --> 02:16:31,120
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1456
02:16:33,790 --> 02:16:35,960
我不该这么说
I shouldn't have said that, man.

1457
02:16:37,970 --> 02:16:39,300
丹尼尔
Daniel...

1458
02:16:40,800 --> 02:16:43,270
你是个不错的朋友
...you are a good friend.

1459
02:16:46,140 --> 02:16:49,300
我知道有时候和我在一起很难相处
I know it can be difficult
with me sometimes.

1460
02:16:55,820 --> 02:16:57,310
算了吧
Forget it.

1461
02:16:58,490 --> 02:17:00,150
没事的
It's okay, man.

1462
02:17:01,420 --> 02:17:03,010
就按你的方式办事吧
Let's do it your way.

1463
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:23,370
哦,神啊
Oh, God.

1464
02:17:23,540 --> 02:17:27,910
金字塔跨国公司,
有人听说过吗
Pyramid Transnational.
Anyone heard of it?

1465
02:17:35,390 --> 02:17:36,880
你这帮混蛋
Oh, you bastards.

1466
02:17:37,060 --> 02:17:40,150
我请每个人喝酒,你们却这样出卖我？
I buy everyone a round
and you sell me out like this?

1467
02:17:41,360 --> 02:17:44,660
滚远点,不然我把这玻璃杯砸碎在你脸上
Back off, or I'll stick this glass
in your squidgy face.

1468
02:17:46,370 --> 02:17:49,300
大家都冷静下,我们想简单行事
Everybody stay calm.
We'll try to keep this brief.

1469
02:17:51,410 --> 02:17:53,570
洛伊,德斯在金字塔公司的薪水册上
Roy Chess. On Pyramid payroll.

1470
02:17:53,740 --> 02:17:58,240
试图想杀死阿德丽安
他已经死了,你认识他吗？
Tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Dead now.
Did you know him?

1471
02:17:58,410 --> 02:18:00,070
不认识
No.

1472
02:18:01,450 --> 02:18:02,710
认识,认识
Yeah, yeah!

1473
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:05,820
我雇了他,我很了解他
那你就是罪人了
-I hired him. I knew him from the inside.
-You're a felon.

1474
02:18:05,990 --> 02:18:08,960
我以前是,不过很久前就改过自新了,我发誓
I was. I've been straight
ever since I got out, I swear.

1475
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:12,850
我都不怎么认识Chess,只是老熟人让我雇佣他的
I barely knew Chess that well,
but I was told to hire from the old life.

1476
02:18:13,030 --> 02:18:16,620
谁让你雇的？
我的客户,斯雷特小姐
-Told by whom?
-My contact, Miss Slater.

1477
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:19,390
珍妮斯雷特也在金字塔公司工作？
Janey Slater works for Pyramid too?

1478
02:18:19,570 --> 02:18:23,530
是啊,她是,她说雇佣前科犯人是公司计划的一部分
Yeah, she was real nice. She said hiring
ex-cons was part of the company program.

1479
02:18:23,700 --> 02:18:27,400
给大家一个改过自新的机会
求你了,放放手,我说的都是实话
Give people a second chance.
God, please let go! I'm telling the truth!

1480
02:18:31,550 --> 02:18:34,780
珍妮 斯雷特,曼哈顿的前女友
Janey Slater, Manhattan's old girlfriend.

1481
02:18:34,950 --> 02:18:37,650
阿德丽安能帮我们差清楚谁是金字塔公司的幕后主谋
Adrian might help us
find out who's underwriting Pyramid.

1482
02:18:37,820 --> 02:18:38,880
跟着钱调查
Follow the money.

1483
02:18:39,050 --> 02:18:42,320
不到一小时前,前治安员
WOMAN [ON TV] : --former member of the
Minutemen Hollis Mason found murdered...

1484
02:18:42,490 --> 02:18:44,820
霍利斯・梅森在自己公寓被谋杀
...in his apartment less than
an hour ago.

1485
02:18:44,990 --> 02:18:49,090
目击者说大约在命案发生的时候
Witnesses reported seeing members
of a local gang known as the Knot-Tops...

1486
02:18:49,260 --> 02:18:52,530
看见叫做Knot-Tops的当地黑帮离开
...Ieaving the area right around
the estimated time of death.

1487
02:18:52,700 --> 02:18:55,640
蒂芙妮・伯恩斯,现场报道
Reporting live, Tiffany Burns....

1488
02:18:57,970 --> 02:19:00,960
-谁干的 -我知道你想牺牲我
-Who did it?
-I knew you were gonna victimize me, man.

1489
02:19:01,140 --> 02:19:03,270
我的公民权利呢？不能因为我穿着…
What about my civil rights?
Just because I'm wearing--

1490
02:19:03,440 --> 02:19:06,500
-告诉我是谁干的 -很多人这种打扮
-Tell me who did it!
-A lot of people dress like this.

1491
02:19:07,850 --> 02:19:09,750
谁杀了霍利斯・梅森
Who murdered Hollis Mason?

1492
02:19:15,420 --> 02:19:17,690
告诉你的朋友们他们死了
You tell your friends they're dead.

1493
02:19:17,860 --> 02:19:21,420
我要把这一片都毁掉
I'm gonna take out this entire
rathole neighborhood.

1494
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:24,090
我要拧断你的脖子
I'll break your neck!

1495
02:19:24,670 --> 02:19:27,660
丹尼尔,当着平民的面不要这样
Daniel, not in front of the civilians.

1496
02:19:28,270 --> 02:19:31,100
该死的,霍利斯
Oh, goddamn. Goddamn, Hollis.

1497
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:44,280
我们就在这谈话吧
JON:
This is where we hold our conversation.

1498
02:19:44,890 --> 02:19:48,790
你告诉我你和丹尼尔曾经睡在一起
In it, you reveal to me that you and
Dreiberg have been sleeping together.

1499
02:19:49,960 --> 02:19:53,320
-你知道我和丹尼尔的事？-现在还不知道
-You know about me and Dan?
-Not yet.

1500
02:19:53,630 --> 02:19:56,460
但是过一会你就会告诉我
But in a few moments
you're going to tell me.

1501
02:19:58,800 --> 02:20:03,830
如果你已经知道未来,为什么我离开的时候你那么惊讶
If you already know the future, then why
were you surprised when I left you?

1502
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,200
还有那个记者向你发难的时候？
Or when that reporter ambushed you?

1503
02:20:06,370 --> 02:20:10,000
你已经知道结尾,为什么还要辩解呢
Why even argue about it
if you already know how this is gonna end?

1504
02:20:11,180 --> 02:20:13,440
我没有别的选择
I have no choice.

1505
02:20:14,750 --> 02:20:17,680
一切都是注定的
Everything is preordained.

1506
02:20:17,850 --> 02:20:20,180
包括我的反应
Even my responses.

1507
02:20:21,160 --> 02:20:24,750
你要经历那些动作
And you're just going through
the motions.

1508
02:20:24,930 --> 02:20:28,330
宇宙中最强大的东西仍然只是一个木偶
The most powerful thing in the universe
is still just a puppet.

1509
02:20:31,470 --> 02:20:34,130
我们都是木偶,劳丽
We are all puppets, Laurie.

1510
02:20:35,070 --> 02:20:37,560
我只不过是能看见绳子的木偶
I'm just a puppet
who can see the strings.

1511
02:20:37,740 --> 02:20:39,430
如果你错了呢
And what if you're wrong?

1512
02:20:39,610 --> 02:20:44,100
为什么我对时间的看法这么困扰你
Why does my perception of time
distress you so?

1513
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:46,180
因为这是没有人性的
Because it's inhuman.

1514
02:20:46,350 --> 02:20:48,750
因为这让我疯狂
Because it makes me insane.

1515
02:20:48,920 --> 02:20:52,820
你经常说你想安慰我,但并不管用
You always say you wanna comfort me.
Well, it isn't working.

1516
02:21:00,230 --> 02:21:02,720
听着,我不想争吵
Look, I don't wanna fight.

1517
02:21:04,230 --> 02:21:06,960
很抱歉我和丹尼睡觉了
I'm sorry I slept with Dan.

1518
02:21:07,530 --> 02:21:09,560
你和丹尼睡觉了？
You slept with Dan?

1519
02:21:11,270 --> 02:21:14,260
你刚才说过你已经知道了
You just said that you already
knew about that.

1520
02:21:14,980 --> 02:21:18,970
我经常说
I said often...

1521
02:21:19,650 --> 02:21:23,980
你是我和人类连接的唯一纽带
...that you were my only
remaining link to humanity.

1522
02:21:26,420 --> 02:21:27,910
我凭什么要拯救世界
Why would I save a world...

1523
02:21:28,090 --> 02:21:30,220
何况尘世间,我早都没了筹码
...I no longer have any stake in?

1524
02:21:32,330 --> 02:21:34,390
那就全当是为我吧
Then do it for me.

1525
02:21:35,260 --> 02:21:36,660
如果你真的在乎的话
If you really care.

1526
02:21:36,830 --> 02:21:40,270
你离开我的那一天,我就离开了地球
When you left me, I left Earth.

1527
02:21:40,430 --> 02:21:43,340
难道这还是不在乎？
Does that not show you that I care?

1528
02:21:46,540 --> 02:21:49,480
这里我的火星
My red world here, now...

1529
02:21:50,480 --> 02:21:53,380
如今比你的地球对我来说意义更加重大
...means more to me than your blue one.

1530
02:21:54,150 --> 02:21:55,880
好好看着
Let me show you.

1531
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,940
轰炸机已经准备好了,长官
KlSSlNGER:
Bombers are fueled and ready, sir.

1532
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:28,510
是时候了,先生们
It's time, gentlemen.

1533
02:22:30,620 --> 02:22:33,020
把战备等级提高到1级
Take us to DEFCON one.

1534
02:22:40,290 --> 02:22:43,390
不要在五角大楼,也不要在办公室里
RORSCHACH:
Not in penthouse. Not in office.

1535
02:22:43,560 --> 02:22:46,470
黑夜在这一时刻
What nocturnal proclivities
entice a man with everything...

1536
02:22:46,630 --> 02:22:48,400
给了人无尽的诱惑
...out into the night at this hour?

1537
02:22:50,470 --> 02:22:52,340
丹尼尔？
Daniel?

1538
02:22:53,570 --> 02:22:55,340
你和我？
You with me?

1539
02:22:56,140 --> 02:22:59,270
-对 -那你在干什么
-Yeah.
-Then what are you doing?

1540
02:23:01,380 --> 02:23:03,140
我要找艾德里安的计划
DAN:
I'm gonna look for Adrian's itinerary.

1541
02:23:03,320 --> 02:23:06,080
或许一切都归档了呢
RORSCHACH:
Maybe he keeps on file.

1542
02:23:10,590 --> 02:23:13,060
有东西感觉不对劲 我同意
-Something's not right.
-Agreed.

1543
02:23:13,230 --> 02:23:17,990
珍妮・斯雷特,摩洛,洛伊・德斯都为金字塔公司效力
Janey Slater, Moloch, Roy Chess
all work for Pyramid.

1544
02:23:18,170 --> 02:23:22,800
摩洛说喜剧演员曾经提到他和斯雷特
的名字曾出现在一个名单上
Moloch said the Comedian mentioned list
with his and Slater's name on it.

1545
02:23:22,970 --> 02:23:26,270
不管是谁在掌管金字塔,都有可能让这些人患癌症
Whoever owns Pyramid
could be giving these people cancer.

1546
02:23:26,440 --> 02:23:28,910
并且陷害曼哈顿
Setting Manhattan up.

1547
02:23:43,060 --> 02:23:44,220
真搞笑
Funny.

1548
02:23:44,390 --> 02:23:47,880
法老王曾经盼望着世界末日的到来
Ancient pharaohs looked forward
to the end of the world.

1549
02:23:48,060 --> 02:23:53,090
认为尸体能够重生,并且重新索回金罐子里的心
Believed cadavers would rise,
reclaim hearts from golden jars.

1550
02:23:53,730 --> 02:23:56,360
现在肯定在凝神屏息
Must currently be holding breath
in anticipation.

1551
02:23:56,540 --> 02:23:57,760
法老？
Pharaohs?

1552
02:24:04,650 --> 02:24:06,670
曼哈顿有精神不正常的报告
Got a psych profile on Manhattan.

1553
02:24:07,310 --> 02:24:09,780
看看公司的偷窥者都怎么说的
See what the corporate head-peepers say.

1554
02:24:11,820 --> 02:24:14,340
“一直接受精神治疗”
"Subject continues
to retreat emotionally.

1555
02:24:16,660 --> 02:24:19,720
如果唯一的联系纽带被切断了
If the only remaining ties
were to be severed...

1556
02:24:20,330 --> 02:24:24,290
那就可能从人类状况中完全分开
...we predict total detachment
from the human condition."

1557
02:24:28,400 --> 02:24:30,170
我进入了
DAN:
I'm in.

1558
02:24:59,030 --> 02:25:00,360
糟了
No.

1559
02:25:02,540 --> 02:25:08,300
祝贺,祝贺,维特先生,曼哈顿先生的能源反应堆已经投入使用
MAN: Congratulations, Mr. Veidt.
Dr. Manhattan's energy reactor is online.

1560
02:25:08,480 --> 02:25:12,340
没有您的支持和热情
Your support and your enthusiasm...

1561
02:25:12,510 --> 02:25:14,810
就没有今天的成就
...is what has led to this triumph.

1562
02:25:14,980 --> 02:25:19,010
代表所有研究人员,敬您一杯酒
On behalf of the research team,
we salute you.

1563
02:25:19,190 --> 02:25:21,620
干杯 干杯
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1564
02:25:22,390 --> 02:25:26,520
生命中,又有什么不值得庆祝呢？
ADRlAN: What in life
does not deserve celebrating?

1565
02:25:27,460 --> 02:25:31,560
这是新型的卡纳克
This is the new Karnak.

1566
02:25:31,730 --> 02:25:35,330
这代表了一个持续了2000多年的梦想的顶峰
This represents the culmination of a dream
more than 2000 years old...

1567
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:41,770
梦想在你们坚持不懈的努力下,终于成了现实
...a dream now assured
because of your unquestioning assistance.

1568
02:25:43,910 --> 02:25:45,570
为此
And for this...

1569
02:25:46,410 --> 02:25:48,750
我深感羞愧
...I am ashamed...

1570
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:54,250
羞愧你们现在却无法得到丰厚的回报
...ashamed that you must now share
such inadequate a reward.

1571
02:25:55,920 --> 02:25:57,910
敬法老
To the pharaohs...

1572
02:25:58,860 --> 02:26:01,850
他们委托给仆人们的大秘密
...their greatest secrets
entrusted to their servants...

1573
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:06,830
与仆人们一起被活埋在沙土铸成的坟墓里
...buried alive with them
in sand-floored chambers.

1574
02:26:07,700 --> 02:26:10,100
晚安,绅士们
Sleep well, gentlemen.

1575
02:26:10,770 --> 02:26:14,100
我们全新的太平世界全部都归功于你们
Our new, peaceful world
will be indebted...

1576
02:26:14,440 --> 02:26:17,000
归功于你们的牺牲
...to your great sacrifice.

1577
02:26:17,940 --> 02:26:20,140
布巴迪斯
Bubastis.

1578
02:26:24,320 --> 02:26:27,310
罗夏日记,最后一篇
Rorschach's journal. Final entry.

1579
02:26:27,650 --> 02:26:30,150
维特才是真正的幕后黑手
Veidt's behind everything.

1580
02:26:30,320 --> 02:26:31,920
为什么
Why?

1581
02:26:32,090 --> 02:26:34,150
他到底葫芦里卖的什么药？
What's his endgame?

1582
02:26:34,330 --> 02:26:37,990
我简直无法想象出一个比他更可怕的对手
I cannot imagine
a more dangerous opponent.

1583
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:41,630
常常开玩笑说他快的能追上子弹
Used to joke he was fast enough
to catch a bullet.

1584
02:26:41,800 --> 02:26:44,700
雪地里,他能干掉我们俩
He could kill us both alone in the snow.

1585
02:26:44,870 --> 02:26:48,570
这也是我们即将要去的地方:南极
That's where we're going now:
Antarctica.

1586
02:26:48,740 --> 02:26:51,510
不管看到日记的时候我是死是活
Whether I'm alive or dead
upon this reading...

1587
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:55,940
我希望世界能幸存到你们看到日记的这一天
...I hope the world survives long enough
for this journal to reach you.

1588
02:26:56,120 --> 02:26:58,680
我一生从不妥协
I live my life free of compromise...

1589
02:26:58,850 --> 02:27:02,790
我涉足黑暗,无怨无悔
...and step into the shadow
without complaint or regret.

1590
02:27:03,420 --> 02:27:06,420
罗夏,11月1日
Rorschach, November 1st.

1591
02:27:06,590 --> 02:27:10,120
你就不能干脆告诉我最后是什么吗
LAURlE: Can 't you just tell me how
this ends and save us the trouble?

1592
02:27:11,100 --> 02:27:13,000
你的眼泪
JON:
It ends with you in tears.

1593
02:27:13,170 --> 02:27:16,760
眼泪？那你就不会再回到地球上来？
Tears? So you don't come back to Earth.

1594
02:27:16,940 --> 02:27:20,370
可以这样说吧
At some point, yes.

1595
02:27:21,440 --> 02:27:24,380
那里的街,满是死亡
The streets are filled with death.

1596
02:27:24,540 --> 02:27:26,600
乔,求你了
Jon, please.

1597
02:27:26,780 --> 02:27:31,340
你必须得阻止这些,否则大家都得死
You have to stop this. Everyone will die.

1598
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:35,850
并且宇宙是不会注意到的
And the universe will not even notice.

1599
02:27:38,290 --> 02:27:42,520
在我看来,生命的存在
In my opinion, the existence of life...

1600
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:46,390
只是一种被高估的现象
...is a highly overrated phenomenon.

1601
02:27:48,300 --> 02:27:50,600
看看你的周围
Just look around you.

1602
02:27:53,340 --> 02:27:57,670
没有这么多的微生物,火星依然完好无损
Mars gets along perfectly well
without so much as a microorganism.

1603
02:27:58,310 --> 02:28:02,870
这是个不断变化的地质图形
Here, it's a constantly changing
topographical map...

1604
02:28:03,050 --> 02:28:08,990
不断变幻着,激起1万年宽的涟漪
...flowing and shifting around the pole
in ripples 1 0,000 years wide.

1605
02:28:09,820 --> 02:28:11,310
告诉我
So tell me...

1606
02:28:11,490 --> 02:28:15,860
这些怎么会被仅仅一条石油管道所改变？
...how would all of this be greatly improved
by an oil pipeline?

1607
02:28:16,330 --> 02:28:18,320
或者是购物街？
By a shopping mall?

1608
02:28:22,670 --> 02:28:26,970
难道要求奇迹出现,就真的这么过分吗？
So it's too much to ask for a miracle?

1609
02:28:27,140 --> 02:28:29,270
奇迹就是无意义的东西
Miracles, by their definition,
are meaningless.

1610
02:28:29,440 --> 02:28:30,930
天啊,乔
Oh, God, Jon!

1611
02:28:31,110 --> 02:28:36,170
只有能发生的才可能发生
别再说下去了
-Only what can happen does happen.
-Just stop your bullshit.

1612
02:28:37,250 --> 02:28:39,780
赶紧让这东西着陆
Land this thing. Now.

1613
02:28:39,950 --> 02:28:42,510
遵命
JON:
As you wish.

1614
02:28:48,130 --> 02:28:49,190
你知道吗？
LAURlE:
You know what?

1615
02:28:49,360 --> 02:28:52,060
把我送回地球,让我和丹,还有我妈一起受煎熬好了
You can send me back to Earth
to fry with Dan and my mom...

1616
02:28:52,230 --> 02:28:54,600
还和其他所有不值一文的人类
...and all the other worthless humans.

1617
02:28:54,770 --> 02:28:58,200
不过你还是错了,你说了这最后会以我的眼泪结束
But know that you were wrong.
You said this ended with me in tears...

1618
02:28:58,370 --> 02:29:02,540
看看,没有眼泪,也许你什么都错了
...and look: nothing.
Maybe you were wrong about everything.

1619
02:29:02,710 --> 02:29:07,980
你抱怨我从不以生命的视角来看待生命
You complain that I refuse to see life
on life's terms...

1620
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:12,480
但你从来不从我的视角去认知事情
...yet you continuously refuse
to see things from my perspective.

1621
02:29:12,650 --> 02:29:17,060
你封锁一切使你感到惧怕的东西
我不怕
-You shut out what you're afraid of.
-I'm not afraid.

1622
02:29:17,220 --> 02:29:22,250
你想我按你的视角认知世界？
那做给我看看,按你方法做
You want me to see things your way?
Go ahead, show me. Do that thing you do.

1623
02:29:29,400 --> 02:29:34,500
魔术,梦想,这都是我以前拥有的
我曾是个英雄,真混蛋
Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
I was a hero, goddamn it!

1624
02:29:34,670 --> 02:29:37,730
你变老了并不是我的错
你又有什么好抱怨的呢？
It's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

1625
02:29:37,910 --> 02:29:40,040
我养育你还有你的孩子
I put food on the table
for you and your child.

1626
02:29:40,210 --> 02:29:43,010
你怎么不去找艾迪？或许他能给你提供更好的生活
Call your friend Eddie.
Maybe he can give you a better life.

1627
02:29:43,750 --> 02:29:46,450
就连肮脏的过去
Even the grimy parts of it...

1628
02:29:46,820 --> 02:29:49,050
也变得越来越清晰
...keep on getting brighter.

1629
02:29:49,390 --> 02:29:52,980
你妈妈,她一直以来可都是选美冠军哦
You know, your mom, she was one
of the all-time champion beauties.

1630
02:29:53,160 --> 02:29:57,600
你和她眼镜长的一样,你有…
别碰她
-You got her eyes, you know. You got--
-Take your hands off her.

1631
02:29:57,760 --> 02:29:59,890
嘿,美人,好久不见了
EDDlE:
Hey, doll. Long time no see.

1632
02:30:00,070 --> 02:30:02,830
我不这样认为,艾迪,上车
Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
Get in the car.

1633
02:30:03,340 --> 02:30:05,200
现在
Now.

1634
02:30:06,170 --> 02:30:08,160
你就没有点道德底线吗
Are there no depths you won't sink to?

1635
02:30:08,340 --> 02:30:12,180
神啊,难道跟…
Jesus Christ, Sally.
Can't a guy talk to his...

1636
02:30:12,880 --> 02:30:14,570
老朋友的女儿说话犯法？
...you know, old friend's daughter?

1637
02:30:16,880 --> 02:30:18,210
开车
Drive.

1638
02:30:24,220 --> 02:30:27,020
当时是个错误,就那一次
SALLY:
It was a mistake. One time.

1639
02:30:27,330 --> 02:30:30,490
他想强奸你,多年以后,你让他完成当年的心愿？
Guy tries to rape you, and years later,
you let him finish the job?

1640
02:30:30,730 --> 02:30:33,430
怎么了？你是喝醉了,还是寂寞了
What? Were you drunk or just lonely?

1641
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:36,540
我一辈子都是这个名声吗
Am I ever gonna live this down?

1642
02:30:39,910 --> 02:30:41,030
劳丽
Laurie.

1643
02:30:45,910 --> 02:30:47,240
不
No.

1644
02:30:49,250 --> 02:30:51,740
不,不是他
No, not him.

1645
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:54,010
喜剧演员
The Comedian...

1646
02:30:54,420 --> 02:30:56,510
是你的父亲
...was your father.

1647
02:30:57,990 --> 02:30:59,690
不
No.

1648
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:08,700
不,不
No! No! No!

1649
02:31:41,300 --> 02:31:43,290
我的生命
My life is just...

1650
02:31:43,970 --> 02:31:46,100
简直就是个天大的玩笑
...one big joke.

1651
02:31:46,270 --> 02:31:48,830
我不这样想
I don't think your life is a joke.

1652
02:31:50,480 --> 02:31:52,470
是啊,呃
Yeah, well...

1653
02:31:54,310 --> 02:31:58,480
抱歉,我不相信你的幽默感
...I'm sorry if I don't
trust your sense of humor.

1654
02:32:06,660 --> 02:32:08,320
我要是承认我错了
Will you smile...

1655
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,460
你会笑个给我看吗？
...if I admit I was wrong?

1656
02:32:15,340 --> 02:32:17,330
错什么了？
LAURlE:
About what?

1657
02:32:19,340 --> 02:32:20,830
关于奇迹的事
Miracles.

1658
02:32:22,510 --> 02:32:25,670
一些几率很小的事情在重复的出现
Events with astronomical odds
of occurring...

1659
02:32:26,510 --> 02:32:29,000
就像是氧气变成了金子一样
...Iike oxygen turning into gold.

1660
02:32:29,180 --> 02:32:34,020
我一直都想目睹这样的事情发生
I've longed to witness such an event,
and yet I neglect...

1661
02:32:34,690 --> 02:32:37,050
却一直忽视了,人类造人的力量
...that in human coupling...

1662
02:32:37,860 --> 02:32:41,730
数以百万的细胞组成了一个生命体
...millions upon millions of cells
compete to create life...

1663
02:32:42,200 --> 02:32:44,990
一代延续一代
...for generation after generation...

1664
02:32:45,870 --> 02:32:48,930
直到,你的母亲
...until finally, your mother...

1665
02:32:49,300 --> 02:32:50,500
爱上了一个男人
...Ioves a man...

1666
02:32:51,140 --> 02:32:54,730
爱德华・布莱克,那个喜剧演员
她有一万个理由恨他
...Edward Blake, the Comedian,
a man she has every reason to hate...

1667
02:32:54,910 --> 02:32:58,900
出于对这种深不可测的几率的一种反叛
...and out of that contradiction,
against unfathomable odds...

1668
02:32:59,580 --> 02:33:01,480
才有了你
...it's you--

1669
02:33:03,220 --> 02:33:04,550
独一无二的
Only...

1670
02:33:05,220 --> 02:33:06,710
你
...you.

1671
02:33:07,550 --> 02:33:08,820
出生在这个世界上
--that emerged.

1672
02:33:09,390 --> 02:33:13,880
把如此与众不同的相貌
To distill so specific a form...

1673
02:33:14,060 --> 02:33:16,320
从所有错乱的基因中提取出来
...from all that chaos...

1674
02:33:18,230 --> 02:33:21,200
就像是把空气变成了金子
...is like turning air into gold.

1675
02:33:25,570 --> 02:33:27,560
简直就是奇迹
A miracle.

1676
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:32,570
因此
And so...

1677
02:33:33,080 --> 02:33:34,910
我的确错了
...I was wrong.

1678
02:33:36,920 --> 02:33:40,750
擦干眼泪,我们回去吧
Now dry your eyes, and let's go home.

1679
02:34:08,280 --> 02:34:12,310
表层受压了,温度超高
We got a bearing on that artificial structure.
Heat signature's off the charts.

1680
02:34:13,290 --> 02:34:16,380
维特
我不喜欢阿基摇摇晃晃的
-Veidt.
-I don't like the way Archie's kicking.

1681
02:34:24,800 --> 02:34:27,630
引擎 引擎出毛病了,赶紧抓牢了
-The engines.
-They're icing up. Hold onto something.

1682
02:34:28,400 --> 02:34:30,430
丹尼尔,我们飞的太低了
Daniel, you're coming in too low.

1683
02:34:33,310 --> 02:34:36,470
别打乱我,赶紧飞高点
Don't wish to interfere,
but perhaps should pull up sharply--

1684
02:34:36,640 --> 02:34:40,580
我知道,我正在试着飞高点,我操
I know! I'm trying.
I'm trying to pull him up, goddamn it!

1685
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:11,470
我正试着改变尾焰排出的路径,来降低温度
DAN: I'm gonna redirect the heat from
the flamethrower to speed up deicing...

1686
02:35:11,640 --> 02:35:14,510
不过得需要一会时间,我们没有时间了
...but it's gonna take a while
and we don't have time to wait.

1687
02:35:16,020 --> 02:35:17,480
你得多穿点取暖
You need something warmer.

1688
02:35:18,020 --> 02:35:20,180
我穿这就不冷
Fine like this.

1689
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:51,550
怎么了,宝贝？
What is it, girl?

1690
02:35:53,850 --> 02:35:55,550
嗯
Mm.

1691
02:36:21,150 --> 02:36:23,410
阿德丽安是和平主义者
DAN:
Adrian's a pacifist.

1692
02:36:23,620 --> 02:36:28,250
他是个素食主义者,一生中都没有杀生过
He's a vegetarian, for chrissakes.
He's never killed anyone in his life.

1693
02:36:28,420 --> 02:36:29,820
希特勒也是素食主义者
Hitler was vegetarian.

1694
02:36:29,990 --> 02:36:34,520
你太谨慎了,把他交给我吧,我们不会
有第二次机会了
You're squeamish, leave him to me.
We won't get second chance.

1695
02:37:46,670 --> 02:37:48,000
先生们
Gentlemen.

1696
02:37:48,500 --> 02:37:52,440
欢迎欢迎 阿德丽安,我们都知道了
-Welcome.
-Adrian, we know everything.

1697
02:37:52,600 --> 02:37:54,370
那,还有什么好说的
Then what's there to discuss, Dan?

1698
02:37:54,540 --> 02:37:57,530
要说的多着呢,是你杀了喜剧演员
Plenty. You killed Comedian.

1699
02:37:57,710 --> 02:37:59,230
希望他能安息
May he rest in peace.

1700
02:37:59,750 --> 02:38:02,340
是布莱克首先想明白的
Blake figured it out first.

1701
02:38:02,510 --> 02:38:06,580
尼克森一直监视着我们,防止我们搞破坏
Nixon had him keeping tabs on us,
making sure we weren 't rocking the boat.

1702
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:09,780
布莱克发现了我来卡纳克的目的
Blake found out what I was doing
here in Karnak...

1703
02:38:09,960 --> 02:38:14,020
他去拜访可怜的摩洛,他已经快不行了
...and by the time he visited poor Moloch,
he was cracking badly.

1704
02:38:14,190 --> 02:38:17,460
连我都无法想象他会改变主意
Even I couldn't predict he'd be the one
to have a change of heart.

1705
02:38:18,200 --> 02:38:19,720
于是
So...

1706
02:38:20,770 --> 02:38:22,700
我不得不杀他灭口
...I had to kill him.

1707
02:38:23,270 --> 02:38:27,030
然后我摆平了乔,真不是件容易活
Then I neutralized Jon. No easy task.

1708
02:38:27,210 --> 02:38:29,670
我花了20亿,来研究超光速粒子
I put roughly $2 billion
into tachyon research...

1709
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:31,870
来阻断乔对未来的预测
...to block Jon's vision of the future.

1710
02:38:32,040 --> 02:38:34,310
你利用他的心理档案来操纵他
RORSCHACH: You used his psych profile
to manipulate him.

1711
02:38:34,810 --> 02:38:36,280
让他离开了这个星球
Got him to leave the planet.

1712
02:38:36,450 --> 02:38:39,850
我认识乔很长时间了,知道他总是无法
摆脱情绪的困扰
I've known Jon long enough
to see he isn't devoid of emotion.

1713
02:38:40,020 --> 02:38:43,920
他微妙的面部变化,对门外汉来说可能
可以瞒过去,不过对我来说…
His subtle facial twitches wouldn't be
noticed by the layman, but to me...

1714
02:38:44,090 --> 02:38:45,920
他可能还抽噎过
...he might as well have been sobbing.

1715
02:38:46,290 --> 02:38:49,420
我所需要的就是沿着这条线索往下
All I needed to do was tug on the thread.

1716
02:38:49,590 --> 02:38:51,490
当他认为使心爱的人患上了癌症
The sudden flood of emotion Jon felt...

1717
02:38:51,660 --> 02:38:55,260
乔所感受到的那种突然的感情袭击
...when he came to believe
he 'd given cancer to the people he loved...

1718
02:38:55,430 --> 02:38:57,560
才是他真正离开地球的原因
... was all the excuse he needed
to leave Earth.

1719
02:38:57,740 --> 02:39:01,570
你的杀手,你雇他干掉我们
DAN: Your bullshit assassin.
You paid him to throw us off.

1720
02:39:01,740 --> 02:39:06,400
丹,德斯先生的死是为了更崇高的目的
ADRlAN: Mr. Chess gave his life
in the service of a higher cause, Dan.

1721
02:39:08,550 --> 02:39:11,640
我让他吃下去了个氰化物胶囊
I put a cyanide capsule in his mouth...

1722
02:39:11,820 --> 02:39:14,410
只留下一个漏点
...Ieaving only one loose end:

1723
02:39:15,020 --> 02:39:18,460
那就是,你和你的面具杀手理论
You, and your mask-killer theory...

1724
02:39:18,620 --> 02:39:21,750
你坚持不懈的跟踪一个真正的反社会人
...one you followed
with the tenacity of a true sociopath.

1725
02:39:21,930 --> 02:39:23,620
我给警察提供了线索
I tipped off the police.

1726
02:39:23,800 --> 02:39:26,200
你入狱的时候,我才能更好的行动
Once you were in prison,
I was able to move forward.

1727
02:39:26,360 --> 02:39:28,990
抱歉让你失望了
Sorry to disappoint you.

1728
02:39:42,180 --> 02:39:44,650
我们本该为地球谋福利
DAN: We were supposed to make the world
a better place.

1729
02:39:44,820 --> 02:39:46,550
丹,我现在正是在为地球谋福利
ADRlAN:
Dan, that's exactly what I am doing.

1730
02:39:46,720 --> 02:39:48,050
核战？
DAN:
Nuclear war?

1731
02:39:48,220 --> 02:39:50,380
灭绝人类？
Human extinction?

1732
02:40:00,030 --> 02:40:04,930
当然了,不过只是几个地区而已
ADRlAN: Of course, my moral safeguards
gave me pause at the necessary sacrifice.

1733
02:40:05,100 --> 02:40:08,070
全球的几个重要的地区
A few key regions around the globe--

1734
02:40:08,240 --> 02:40:13,700
纽约,洛杉矶,莫斯科,香港
New York, Los Angeles, Moscow,
Hong Kong.

1735
02:40:13,880 --> 02:40:15,540
将会立即分解
--disintegrated in an instant.

1736
02:40:16,280 --> 02:40:19,610
1500万人将死于非命
Fifteen million people killed...

1737
02:40:19,790 --> 02:40:21,840
这都是曼哈顿博士一手策划的
...by Dr. Manhattan himself.

1738
02:40:23,050 --> 02:40:25,850
这是第三次世界大战对地球的惩罚
The world's punishment
for flirting with World War lll.

1739
02:40:26,020 --> 02:40:27,150
乔是不会这么做的
Jon wouldn't do that.

1740
02:40:27,730 --> 02:40:30,420
而事实只有我们三个人知道
A fact no one outside this room
ever has to know.

1741
02:40:31,060 --> 02:40:34,860
我一直致力的能源大突破也已经初见成效了
The energy breakthrough I was working on
just came to fruition.

1742
02:40:35,470 --> 02:40:39,460
这些年来,乔一直在帮我复制他的能量
All these years, Jon was helping me
replicate his power...

1743
02:40:39,640 --> 02:40:42,160
而却不知道我到底打算怎么利用这些能量
...unaware of how I planned to use it.

1744
02:40:42,340 --> 02:40:44,330
知道嘛
You see...

1745
02:40:45,240 --> 02:40:47,640
喜剧演员说的对
...the Comedian was right.

1746
02:40:48,350 --> 02:40:53,340
人性的残忍将终会导致全球灭亡
Humanity's savage nature
will inevitably lead to global annihilation.

1747
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:56,320
所以为了征求这个地球
So in order to save this planet...

1748
02:40:56,590 --> 02:40:58,650
我必须得用
...I had to trick it...

1749
02:40:59,020 --> 02:41:03,050
人类史上最伟大的恶作剧来解决此事
...with the greatest practical joke
in human history.

1750
02:41:03,330 --> 02:41:06,730
-杀死数百万人 -来拯救数十亿人
-Killing millions.
-To save billions.

1751
02:41:07,270 --> 02:41:09,230
必要的犯罪
A necessary crime.

1752
02:41:09,400 --> 02:41:11,560
我们不会让你得逞的
RORSCHACH:
You know we can't let you do that.

1753
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,130
“得逞”？罗夏
"Do that," Rorschach?

1754
02:41:15,310 --> 02:41:16,930
我不是连环画里的恶棍
I'm not a comic-book villain.

1755
02:41:17,780 --> 02:41:20,040
我有必要给你们解释我的大师之笔吗？
Do you think
I'd explain my masterstroke to you...

1756
02:41:20,210 --> 02:41:24,380
如果你们能,哪怕一丁点,影响到我的计划
...if there were even the slightest possibility
you could affect the outcome?

1757
02:41:27,120 --> 02:41:29,920
35分钟前我就启动了这一切
I triggered it 35 minutes ago.

1758
02:43:09,390 --> 02:43:12,380
神啊,亨利
Jesus Christ, Henry.

1759
02:43:12,560 --> 02:43:14,750
我们为什么就不发射个侦探卫星？
Why the hell
didn't we get a launch detection?

1760
02:43:16,660 --> 02:43:21,100
这不是苏联
It's not the Soviets, sir.

1761
02:43:21,670 --> 02:43:24,830
这都需要能源签章
Intel indicates the energy signature...

1762
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,440
是由曼哈顿博士
...was generated by...

1763
02:43:28,410 --> 02:43:30,840
签名才有效
...Dr. Manhattan.

1764
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:35,240
乔
Jon.

1765
02:43:38,250 --> 02:43:39,380
干涉
Interference.

1766
02:43:39,990 --> 02:43:41,890
大范围干涉
Cataclysmic interference.

1767
02:43:51,600 --> 02:43:54,360
简直无法置信,这真的发生了
LAURlE:
I can't believe it happened.

1768
02:43:55,370 --> 02:43:58,860
这不是核战引发的
This wasn't caused by nuclear warheads.

1769
02:44:02,940 --> 02:44:04,240
是我
It was me.

1770
02:44:06,280 --> 02:44:07,870
我
I...

1771
02:44:08,450 --> 02:44:09,470
我一手造成的
...did this.

1772
02:44:10,120 --> 02:44:13,570
你什么意思？这是你造成的？
间接造成的
-What do you mean, you did this?
-Not directly.

1773
02:44:14,550 --> 02:44:17,250
看起来像是我造成的
It was made to look like I did it.

1774
02:44:20,290 --> 02:44:21,720
阿德丽安
Adrian.

1775
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:29,990
说曹操 曹操到
Speak of the devil.

1776
02:44:33,140 --> 02:44:34,160
-乔 -我知道
DAN: Jon--
JON: I know.

1777
02:44:34,340 --> 02:44:36,500
一定要阻止他,杀了布莱克,杀了数以百万的人
RORSCHACH: Must stop him.
Killed Blake, killed millions.

1778
02:44:36,670 --> 02:44:38,010
在这等着
Wait here.

1779
02:44:49,150 --> 02:44:51,520
住手吧,阿德丽安
Adrian, stop this.

1780
02:44:52,990 --> 02:44:54,860
超光速粒子很聪明
The tachyons were clever...

1781
02:44:55,990 --> 02:45:00,330
即便我无法预测你在哪,我也能把这些墙弄粉碎
...but even if I can't predict where you are,
I can turn the walls to glass.

1782
02:45:01,670 --> 02:45:04,130
我该谢谢你
I should thank you.

1783
02:45:05,300 --> 02:45:08,500
我差点忘了那种快感…
I'd almost forgotten the excitement
of not knowing...

1784
02:45:09,510 --> 02:45:12,500
对未来不确定的快乐
...the delights of uncertainty.

1785
02:45:16,680 --> 02:45:18,340
原谅我,宝贝
Forgive me, girl.

1786
02:45:41,310 --> 02:45:43,000
你真是个混蛋
You're such an asshole.

1787
02:46:16,940 --> 02:46:18,880
维特,你这个混蛋
DAN:
Veidt, you bastard.

1788
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:21,510
你要敢伤害她,我…
丹
-lf you've hurt her, I'll--
-Dan...

1789
02:46:23,250 --> 02:46:27,840
醒醒吧,我的新世界不需要这么多的英雄主义
...grow up. My new world
demands less obvious heroism.

1790
02:46:28,020 --> 02:46:30,010
你的
Your...

1791
02:46:30,190 --> 02:46:35,150
那一套英雄主义太多余了
你们有什么成就吗？
...schoolboy heroics are redundant.
What have they achieved?

1792
02:46:36,760 --> 02:46:39,630
还是没能拯救地球
Failing to prevent Earth's salvation...

1793
02:46:40,600 --> 02:46:43,000
这就是你们唯一的功绩
...is your only triumph.

1794
02:46:43,200 --> 02:46:45,100
我对你失望透顶了,阿德丽安
JON:
I'm disappointed in you, Adrian.

1795
02:46:45,900 --> 02:46:49,400
我很失望
I'm very disappointed.

1796
02:47:01,790 --> 02:47:04,950
我学到的第一个花招,就是重组我自己
Reassembling myself
was the first trick I learned.

1797
02:47:05,620 --> 02:47:08,020
这是杀不了奥斯特曼的
It didn't kill Osterman.

1798
02:47:10,630 --> 02:47:12,990
你真的觉得这能置我于死地？
Did you really think it would kill me?

1799
02:47:14,300 --> 02:47:17,460
我在太阳表面都行走过
I have walked across the surface
of the sun.

1800
02:47:17,970 --> 02:47:21,130
我目睹了如此小又如此快速的事情
I have witnessed events
so tiny and so fast...

1801
02:47:21,310 --> 02:47:24,370
简直就是白驹过隙
...they can hardly be said
to have occurred at all...

1802
02:47:24,540 --> 02:47:28,170
不过你,阿德丽安,你只是个凡人而已
...but you, Adrian, you're just a man.

1803
02:47:29,310 --> 02:47:31,810
世上最智慧的人
The world's smartest man...

1804
02:47:32,120 --> 02:47:34,550
对我构成的威胁
...poses no more threat to me...

1805
02:47:34,720 --> 02:47:37,850
就和最智慧的白蚁对我的威胁一样大
...than does its smartest termite.

1806
02:47:40,120 --> 02:47:41,590
这是什么？
What's that?

1807
02:47:41,990 --> 02:47:43,860
又一个终极武器？
Another ultimate weapon?

1808
02:47:44,500 --> 02:47:46,220
是
Yes.

1809
02:47:47,830 --> 02:47:49,300
可以这么说
You could say that.

1810
02:47:52,840 --> 02:47:54,770
…遭受攻击
--came under attack.

1811
02:47:55,610 --> 02:47:58,940
数以万计的人死于非命
Millions of lives were suddenly ended...

1812
02:47:59,280 --> 02:48:04,480
这是曼哈顿博士自己犯下的罪恶
...in an act of evil
perpetrated by Dr. Manhattan himself.

1813
02:48:06,280 --> 02:48:10,220
自从攻击开始的一刻,我就一直和
Since the attacks,
I have been in constant contact...

1814
02:48:10,390 --> 02:48:13,380
苏联总理密切通信
... with the premier of the U. S. S.R.

1815
02:48:13,790 --> 02:48:16,620
不计前嫌
Putting aside our past differences...

1816
02:48:16,960 --> 02:48:19,120
我们都同意合伙
... we have both pledged to unite...

1817
02:48:19,460 --> 02:48:22,800
来对付这个共同的敌人
...against this common enemy.

1818
02:48:23,300 --> 02:48:25,290
同世界所有人一起
With the rest of the world...

1819
02:48:25,740 --> 02:48:27,760
我们会胜利
... we will prevail.

1820
02:48:30,310 --> 02:48:33,300
今天,我们将永远铭记
This is a day we shall never forget.

1821
02:48:33,480 --> 02:48:37,680
我们会继续保护人类
And yet we go forward
to defend the human race...

1822
02:48:37,850 --> 02:48:42,480
保护所有正义和美好的事情
...and all that is good
and just in our world.

1823
02:48:43,820 --> 02:48:48,050
谢谢,上帝保佑我们
Thank you. God bless us all.

1824
02:48:48,430 --> 02:48:50,220
看见没？
ADRlAN:
Do you see?

1825
02:48:52,430 --> 02:48:54,900
两个超级大国,从战争中撤离出来
Two superpowers retreating from war.

1826
02:48:56,500 --> 02:48:58,940
我把地球从水深火热中拯救了出来
I've saved the earth from hell.

1827
02:48:59,100 --> 02:49:01,070
我们俩都是
We both have.

1828
02:49:01,540 --> 02:49:03,730
对你我来说,同是胜利
This is as much your victory as it is mine.

1829
02:49:08,550 --> 02:49:10,040
我们现在能重新回去
Now we can return...

1830
02:49:11,480 --> 02:49:13,040
干我们该干的事了
...do what we were meant to.

1831
02:49:13,220 --> 02:49:16,190
我们需要正义
We were meant to exact justice.

1832
02:49:16,520 --> 02:49:19,850
人人都将知道你干了什么好事
会吗？
-Everyone's gonna know what you've done.
-Will they?

1833
02:49:20,020 --> 02:49:24,830
揭发我的话,你就会葬送
这么多人的死所带来的和平
By exposing me, you would sacrifice
the peace so many died for today.

1834
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:28,430
和平却建立在谎言的基础上
不过和平
-Peace based on a lie.
-But peace...

1835
02:49:28,600 --> 02:49:30,790
虽然如此… 他说的没错
-...nonetheless.
-He's right.

1836
02:49:31,370 --> 02:49:35,330
揭发阿德丽安只会让世界重新陷入到核战中去
Exposing Adrian would only doom the world
to nuclear destruction again.

1837
02:49:35,510 --> 02:49:38,370
我们不能这样做
No. We can't do this.

1838
02:49:38,540 --> 02:49:40,310
在火星上
On Mars...

1839
02:49:41,810 --> 02:49:43,640
你教会了我生命的意义
...you taught me the value of life.

1840
02:49:44,620 --> 02:49:47,050
如果我们想让生命在这里继续流传下去
If we hope to preserve it here...

1841
02:49:47,850 --> 02:49:49,880
就必须保持沉默
...we must remain silent.

1842
02:49:53,730 --> 02:49:55,660
自己保守好秘密
Keep your own secrets.

1843
02:50:02,530 --> 02:50:03,730
想都别想
Don't even think about it.

1844
02:50:06,340 --> 02:50:08,070
罗夏
Rorschach.

1845
02:50:09,840 --> 02:50:11,370
等等
Wait.

1846
02:50:12,410 --> 02:50:14,500
永不妥协
Never compromise.

1847
02:50:14,880 --> 02:50:17,750
即使是面临世界末日
Not even in the face of armageddon.

1848
02:50:18,150 --> 02:50:21,140
这是我们俩的区别,丹尼尔
That's always been the difference
between us, Daniel.

1849
02:50:32,200 --> 02:50:35,720
我感受过死亡
I've made myself feel every death...

1850
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:43,110
我看见为了拯救人类,而杀死的所有无辜的人
...see every innocent face
I've murdered to save humanity.

1851
02:50:48,680 --> 02:50:52,380
-你都理解的,是吧？-没有宽恕
-You understand, don't you?
JON: Without condoning...

1852
02:50:54,050 --> 02:50:55,950
没有谴责
...or condemning...

1853
02:51:00,360 --> 02:51:02,290
我理解
...I understand.

1854
02:51:09,700 --> 02:51:12,830
让开,人们应该知道真相
Out of my way. People have to be told.

1855
02:51:13,700 --> 02:51:15,640
你知道我不会让你这么做的
You know I can't let you do that.

1856
02:51:16,870 --> 02:51:19,870
你突然间发现了人性？
Suddenly you discover humanity?

1857
02:51:21,310 --> 02:51:23,140
真是时候
Convenient.

1858
02:51:31,860 --> 02:51:36,420
如果你一开始就关心的话
这一切就都不会发生了
If you'd cared from the start,
none of this would have happened.

1859
02:51:40,200 --> 02:51:43,170
我能改变一切
I can change almost anything...

1860
02:51:47,740 --> 02:51:50,070
不过不能改变人类的本性
...but I can't change human nature.

1861
02:51:51,410 --> 02:51:54,810
当然了,你必须得保护维特的新乌托邦
Of course
you must protect Veidt's new utopia.

1862
02:51:56,080 --> 02:51:59,410
为这个根基,多死一个人又怎样？
What's one more body
amongst foundations?

1863
02:52:05,590 --> 02:52:07,460
你还等什么？
Well, what are you waiting for?

1864
02:52:10,930 --> 02:52:12,760
动手吧
Do it.

1865
02:52:18,870 --> 02:52:19,890
动手吧
Do it!

1866
02:52:22,610 --> 02:52:25,970
不
No!

1867
02:52:43,460 --> 02:52:49,230
我离开这个星系,去一个不这么复杂的地方
JON: I'm leaving this galaxy
for one a little less complicated.

1868
02:52:49,400 --> 02:52:51,890
我以为你又一次在意生命呢
LAURlE: I thought you said you cared
about life again.

1869
02:52:52,070 --> 02:52:53,470
我真的这样认为
JON:
I do.

1870
02:52:54,810 --> 02:52:57,710
或许我得再创造点生命
I think maybe I'll create some.

1871
02:53:01,810 --> 02:53:04,140
保重,劳丽
Goodbye, Laurie.

1872
02:53:39,380 --> 02:53:40,540
还手啊
Come on.

1873
02:53:43,020 --> 02:53:44,610
还手啊
Come on!

1874
02:53:49,030 --> 02:53:50,360
丹
Dan...

1875
02:53:50,830 --> 02:53:53,590
世界的联合与和平
...a world united and at peace.

1876
02:53:54,470 --> 02:53:55,660
必须有人作出牺牲
There had to be sacrifice.

1877
02:53:55,830 --> 02:54:00,200
不,你没有把人类理想化,你让人类变形了
No! You haven't idealized mankind,
you've deformed it.

1878
02:54:00,370 --> 02:54:02,130
残缺了
You've mutilated it.

1879
02:54:02,510 --> 02:54:04,670
这是你的遗产
That's your legacy.

1880
02:54:13,220 --> 02:54:16,020
这是个真实的恶作剧
That's the real practical joke.

1881
02:55:08,610 --> 02:55:12,600
重申一下,你的电视机没有任何的毛病
MAN [ON TV] : We repeat, there is
nothing wrong with your television set.

1882
02:55:12,780 --> 02:55:16,240
你现在即将参与一场伟大的探险活动
You are about to participate
in a great adventure.

1883
02:55:16,410 --> 02:55:19,580
将要体验威严和神秘的历程
You are about to experience
the awe and mystery...

1884
02:55:19,750 --> 02:55:25,550
从内到外的历程
... which reaches from the inner mind
to the outer limits.

1885
02:55:26,760 --> 02:55:28,950
不喝点什么吗？
SALLY:
Sure you don ' t want a drink?

1886
02:55:29,960 --> 02:55:30,980
不用了
I ' m okay.

1887
02:55:32,060 --> 02:55:33,290
干杯
Cheers.

1888
02:55:34,730 --> 02:55:37,860
有些事情,不说不快
There's something I need
to get off my chest.

1889
02:55:39,140 --> 02:55:41,630
我知道艾迪布莱克是我的亲生父亲
I know that Eddie Blake was my father.

1890
02:55:44,640 --> 02:55:46,410
劳丽
Laurel.

1891
02:55:47,410 --> 02:55:49,740
你肯定对我有想法
What you must think of me.

1892
02:55:50,580 --> 02:55:53,110
抱歉,我一直都瞒着你
I'm sorry I never told you.

1893
02:55:53,280 --> 02:55:55,080
我早该
I should have...

1894
02:55:55,250 --> 02:55:59,380
我不知道该怎么办,我觉得很丢人,很傻
...but I don't know, I just felt ashamed.
I felt stupid.

1895
02:55:59,560 --> 02:56:01,490
没关系了
It doesn't matter.

1896
02:56:02,330 --> 02:56:07,590
是命运让人们去些奇怪的地方
干些奇怪的事情
People's lives take them strange places.
They do strange things...

1897
02:56:08,170 --> 02:56:11,100
然后无法诉说
...and, well,
sometimes they can't talk about them.

1898
02:56:11,270 --> 02:56:13,600
我知道这种感觉
I know how that is...

1899
02:56:14,340 --> 02:56:16,930
不过我想让你知道
...but I just want you to know...

1900
02:56:17,510 --> 02:56:20,340
你对我却从来没做过错事
...that you never did anything wrong
by me.

1901
02:56:24,520 --> 02:56:28,780
你问了我为什么我从来不生他的气
You asked me why I wasn't mad at him.

1902
02:56:30,350 --> 02:56:32,850
因为他让我生了你
Because he gave me you.

1903
02:56:37,860 --> 02:56:38,950
谢谢你,妈妈
Thanks, Mom.

1904
02:56:41,700 --> 02:56:43,500
我爱你
I love you.

1905
02:56:51,040 --> 02:56:55,240
你好,朱庇特 哦,萨拉,是你啊
-Hello, Miss Jupiter.
-Oh, Sally, please.

1906
02:56:56,880 --> 02:57:01,480
打扰了,我得出去透透气了,一会就会来
Excuse me. Gotta go freshen up.
I'll be right back.

1907
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:16,160
你这怎么样了？很好啊,你那呢？
-So how's it going up here?
-Good. How's it going down there?

1908
02:57:16,330 --> 02:57:19,830
很好,我觉得一切都恢复正常了
Good. I think I've got everything working.

1909
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:24,630
阿基的系统都升级了,现在都已经完成了
All of Archie's systems are upgraded.
Finished the tinkering for now...

1910
02:57:24,810 --> 02:57:27,040
现在要做的,就是骑它出去兜圈风
...so all we gotta do is take her out.

1911
02:57:27,210 --> 02:57:30,270
哇,听起来像是个约会哦
Well, that sounds like a date.

1912
02:57:41,590 --> 02:57:43,860
我们会没事的,是吗？
Are we gonna be all right?

1913
02:57:45,930 --> 02:57:50,230
只要大家还一直认为乔在看着我们
我们就不会有事
Long as people think Jon's
still watching us, we'll be all right...

1914
02:57:50,430 --> 02:57:52,300
噩梦都过去了
...in the end.

1915
02:57:53,940 --> 02:57:56,100
我知道乔会怎么说:
I know what Jon would say:

1916
02:57:56,270 --> 02:57:58,300
事情总是没有尽头的
Nothing ends.

1917
02:58:00,210 --> 02:58:02,810
总是没有尽头的
Nothing ever ends.

1918
02:58:50,160 --> 02:58:53,930
西摩,我们都没有题材可以写了
Seymour, we got nothing
to write about anymore.

1919
02:58:54,100 --> 02:58:55,460
国家内的每个人
Everyone in the country...

1920
02:58:55,630 --> 02:58:57,900
世界上的每个国家都手拉着手
...every country in the world
are holding hands...

1921
02:58:58,070 --> 02:59:01,330
唱着和平友爱的歌
...and singing songs
about peace and love.

1922
02:59:01,840 --> 02:59:04,710
感觉像是住在一个超和平的社区内
It's like living in a goddamn
global hippie commune.

1923
02:59:04,880 --> 02:59:08,810
呃,里根说他要在88年竞选总统
Well, Ronald Reagan says he's gonna
be running for president in '88.

1924
02:59:08,980 --> 02:59:10,810
我们来报道这个吧
We could run a piece on that.

1925
02:59:10,980 --> 02:59:14,140
西摩,荒谬的话我们是不能拿来做头条的
Seymour, we don't dignify absurdities
with coverage.

1926
02:59:14,320 --> 02:59:18,150
这还是在美国,谁会想听
白宫里的有个西部牛仔的故事？
This is still America, damn it.
Who wants a cowboy in the White House?

1927
02:59:18,890 --> 02:59:23,120
要不然我去档案里再去找点劲爆的？
Okay. I could look for something
in the crank file.

1928
02:59:23,290 --> 02:59:24,890
档案里面？
Crank file.

1929
02:59:25,060 --> 02:59:27,050
随便了,找点原创的
Whatever. Take some initiative.

1930
02:59:27,230 --> 02:59:29,860
想写什么就写什么,全交给你了
Run whatever you like.
I leave it entirely in your hands.

1931
02:59:36,370 --> 02:59:41,070
罗夏日记,1985年,10月12号
Rorschach 's journal, October 1 2th, 1 985.

1932
02:59:41,250 --> 02:59:45,710
今晚,喜剧演员死于纽约
Tonight, a comedian died in New York.

1933
02:59:47,250 --> 02:59:51,710
谢谢观看！
