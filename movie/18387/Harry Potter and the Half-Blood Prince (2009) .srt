...the most powerful
love potion in the world.

It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

For example, I smell...

...freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...

389

...spearmint toothpaste.

SLUGHORN: Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.

But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:42,502
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

what he was up to?

that Draco is so interested in...

882

Yes. There can be no light
without the dark.

01:51:20,694 --> 01:51:22,894
Only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so...

1246
01:51:23,072 --> 01:51:26,355
...I need to know what Tom Riddle
asked you years ago in your office...

1247
01:51:26,534 --> 01:51:28,901
...and I need to know what you told him.

1248
01:51:29,620 --> 01:51:32,018
Be brave, professor.

1249
01:51:33,666 --> 01:51:35,741
Be brave like my mother.

1250
01:51:37,044 --> 01:51:39,712
Otherwise, you disgrace her.

1251
01:51:40,839 --> 01:51:43,122
Otherwise, she died for nothing.

1252
01:51:44,134 --> 01:51:49,337
Otherwise, the bowl
will remain empty forever.

1253
01:51:59,898 --> 01:52:03,016
Please, don't think badly of me
when you see it.

1254
01:52:05,028 --> 01:52:08,313
You've no idea what he was like,
even then.

1255
01:52:45,065 --> 01:52:47,766
RIDDLE:
I was in the library the other night...

1256
01:52:47,942 --> 01:52:50,101
...in the Restricted Section...

1257
01:52:50,986 --> 01:52:54,605
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

1258
01:52:55,908 --> 01:52:58,651
It's called, as I understand it...

1259
01:52:59,954 --> 01:53:01,278
...a Horcrux.

1260
01:53:03,124 --> 01:53:05,866
- I beg your pardon?
- Horcrux.

1261
01:53:06,293 --> 01:53:08,962
I came across the term while reading...

1262
01:53:09,129 --> 01:53:12,121
...and I didn't fully understand it.

1263
01:53:12,299 --> 01:53:14,039
I'm not sure what you
were reading, Tom...

1264
01:53:14,218 --> 01:53:16,782
...but this is very dark stuff,
very dark indeed.

1265
01:53:16,970 --> 01:53:18,503
Which is...

1266
01:53:19,639 --> 01:53:21,463
...why I came to you.

1267
01:53:24,311 --> 01:53:29,929
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

1268
01:53:30,107 --> 01:53:32,725
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

1269
01:53:35,320 --> 01:53:39,314
One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

1270
01:53:39,490 --> 01:53:43,108
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1271
01:53:43,284 --> 01:53:44,391
Protected?

1272
01:53:44,578 --> 01:53:47,779
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

1273
01:53:49,249 --> 01:53:51,648
In other words, you cannot die.

1274
01:53:58,843 --> 01:54:02,001
And how does one split his soul, sir?

1275
01:54:02,178 --> 01:54:04,963
SLUGHORN: I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.

1276
01:54:06,182 --> 01:54:07,673
Murder.

1277
01:54:08,184 --> 01:54:09,508
Yes.

1278
01:54:10,060 --> 01:54:14,970
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

1279
01:54:15,858 --> 01:54:20,602
RIDDLE: Can you only split the soul
once? For instance, isn't seven...?

1280
01:54:20,779 --> 01:54:22,271
Seven?

1281
01:54:23,031 --> 01:54:28,318
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

1282
01:54:28,495 --> 01:54:32,238
To rip the soul into seven pieces...

1283
01:54:33,415 --> 01:54:36,450
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All academic?

1284
01:54:41,214 --> 01:54:42,538
Of course, sir.

1285
01:54:45,510 --> 01:54:47,502
It'll be our little secret.

1286
01:54:56,312 --> 01:54:57,553
HARRY:
Sir.

1287
01:55:12,952 --> 01:55:15,069
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1288
01:55:15,246 --> 01:55:17,915
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?

1289
01:55:18,083 --> 01:55:21,200
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

1290
01:55:21,376 --> 01:55:22,398
What are they exactly?

1291
01:55:22,586 --> 01:55:25,912
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

1292
01:55:29,093 --> 01:55:30,791
A ring, for example.

1293
01:55:31,427 --> 01:55:32,919
Or a book.

1294
01:55:34,222 --> 01:55:36,589
- Tom Riddle's diary.
- It's a Horcrux, yes.

1295
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:39,215
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

1296
01:55:39,394 --> 01:55:41,676
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1297
01:55:41,854 --> 01:55:43,763
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1298
01:55:43,939 --> 01:55:48,934
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

1299
01:55:49,110 --> 01:55:51,103
- The ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1300
01:55:51,488 --> 01:55:56,232
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1301
01:55:56,410 --> 01:56:00,266
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux...

1302
01:56:00,455 --> 01:56:01,612
One destroys Voldemort.

1303
01:56:01,789 --> 01:56:04,697
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.

1304
01:56:04,875 --> 01:56:08,118
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1305
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:23,966
...leaves traces.

1306
01:56:31,776 --> 01:56:33,850
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?

1307
01:56:34,027 --> 01:56:36,310
- When you leave the school?
- Yes.

1308
01:56:37,155 --> 01:56:40,230
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

1309
01:56:40,408 --> 01:56:44,485
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1310
01:56:46,038 --> 01:56:50,700
Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1311
01:56:54,672 --> 01:56:56,955
SNAPE: Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

1312
01:56:57,132 --> 01:56:59,749
...that you take too much for granted?

1313
01:56:59,926 --> 01:57:04,962
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?

1314
01:57:05,139 --> 01:57:07,257
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1315
01:57:08,142 --> 01:57:13,930
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1316
01:57:32,331 --> 01:57:33,947
Oh, Harry.

1317
01:57:36,543 --> 01:57:38,869
You need a shave, my friend.

1318
01:57:41,673 --> 01:57:45,876
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1319
01:57:46,052 --> 01:57:49,994
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

1320
01:57:51,557 --> 01:57:53,924
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1321
01:57:54,393 --> 01:57:55,884
I'm an old man.

1322
01:57:56,062 --> 01:57:57,719
You still look the same to me, sir.

1323
01:57:59,190 --> 01:58:02,182
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

1324
01:58:02,359 --> 01:58:05,559
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

1325
01:58:08,323 --> 01:58:12,818
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1326
01:58:12,994 --> 01:58:16,487
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

1327
01:58:16,664 --> 01:58:18,489
But there is one condition:

1328
01:58:18,667 --> 01:58:21,867
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

1329
01:58:22,753 --> 01:58:24,369
Yes, sir.

1330
01:58:24,546 --> 01:58:26,664
You do understand what I'm saying?

1331
01:58:27,258 --> 01:58:29,738
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1332

Should I tell you to run, you run.

1333
01:58:32,428 --> 01:58:36,423
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

1334
01:58:41,604 --> 01:58:43,179
Your word, Harry.

1335
01:58:44,815 --> 01:58:46,307

1336
01:58:47,110 --> 01:58:48,767
Take my arm.

Apparate within Hogwarts.

1338
01:58:53,282 --> 01:58:56,733

- In order to gain passage...

...payment must be made.

1344

Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1345
02:00:08,018 --> 02:00:09,842
- You should've let me, sir.
- No, Harry.

Your blood's much more precious
than mine.

1347
02:00:34,918 --> 02:00:39,536
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1348
02:00:39,714 --> 02:00:43,039
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

1349
02:00:45,636 --> 02:00:47,043
Careful.

1350
02:01:10,576 --> 02:01:11,681
There it is.

how do we get there?

If you would, Harry.

Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?

1354
02:02:30,275 --> 02:02:31,641
Oh, yes.

1355
02:02:42,744 --> 02:02:44,318
It has to be drunk.

1356
02:02:44,496 --> 02:02:47,321
All of it has to be drunk.

You remember the conditions on which
I brought you with me?

1358

This potion might paralyze me.

1359
02:02:54,506 --> 02:02:56,163
Might make me forget why I'm here.

1360
02:02:56,967 --> 02:03:00,251
Might cause me so much pain
that I beg for relief.

You are not to indulge these requests.

It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.

Even if you have to force it
down my throat.

- Understood?
- Why can't I drink it, sir?

1365

Because I am much older, much cleverer,
and much less valuable.
