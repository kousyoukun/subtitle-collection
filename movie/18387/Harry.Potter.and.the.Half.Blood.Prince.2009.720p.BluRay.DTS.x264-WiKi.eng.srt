00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,263
<i>I killed Sirius Black!</i>

4
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,695
<i>He's back.</i>

5
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:06,860
HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE

6
00:02:55,713 --> 00:02:58,416
<i>The police are
continuing with the investigation...</i>

7
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:00,629
<i>... into the cause
of the Millennium Bridge disaster.</i>

8
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:04,501
<i>Traffic has been halted
as police search for survivors.</i>

9
00:03:04,681 --> 00:03:06,338
<i>The surrounding area remains closed.</i>

10
00:03:06,516 --> 00:03:09,680
<i>The mayor has urged Londoners
to remain calm...</i>

11
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:16,267
"Harry Potter."

12
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:18,434
Who's Harry Potter?

13
00:03:19,987 --> 00:03:21,978
Oh, no one.

14
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:23,904
Bit of a tosser, really.

15
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,067
Funny, that paper of yours.

16
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:30,864
Couple nights ago,
I could've sworn I saw a picture move.

17
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,824
- Really?
- Thought I was going around the twist.

18
00:03:40,507 --> 00:03:45,131
- Hey, I was wondering...
- Eleven. That's when I get off.

19
00:03:45,304 --> 00:03:48,089
You can tell me all about
that tosser Harry Potter.

20
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:41,221
You've been reckless this summer, Harry.

21
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,686
I like riding around on trains.

22
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:46,851
Takes my mind off things.

23
00:04:48,365 --> 00:04:50,272
Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?

24
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,781
The tale is thrilling,
if I say so myself.

25
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:56,490
But now is not the time to tell it.

26
00:04:56,665 --> 00:04:58,240
Take my arm.

27
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:03,161
Do as I say.

28
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:13,756
I just Apparated, didn't I?

29
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:17,096
Indeed. Quite successfully too,
I might add.

30
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:19,888
Most people vomit the first time.

31
00:05:20,062 --> 00:05:21,804
I can't imagine why.

32
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:33,277
Welcome to the
charming village of Budleigh Babberton.

33
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,742
Harry, I assume, right about now, you're
wondering why I brought you here.

34
00:05:37,913 --> 00:05:39,619
Am I right?

35
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,157
Actually, sir, after all these years,
I just sort of go with it.

36
00:05:47,757 --> 00:05:49,547
Wands out, Harry.

37
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:02,434
Horace?

38
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,982
Horace?

39
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:09,535
Merlin's beard!

40
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:12,999
No need to disfigure me, Albus.

41
00:07:13,174 --> 00:07:16,873
Well, I must say you
make a very convincing armchair, Horace.

42
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:22,214
It's all in the upholstery. I come by the
stuffing naturally. What gave me away?

43
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:25,050
Dragon's blood.

44
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:28,594
- Oh.
- Oh, yes, introductions.

45
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:32,768
Harry, I'd like you to meet
an old friend and colleague of mine...

46
00:07:32,943 --> 00:07:34,399
...Horace Slughorn.

47
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:36,061
Horace...

48
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:39,023
...well, you know who this is.

49
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:41,897
Harry Potter.

50
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:46,488
What's with all the theatrics, Horace?

51
00:07:46,664 --> 00:07:49,118
You weren't, by any chance,
waiting for someone else?

52
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:51,746
Someone else?
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

53
00:07:52,211 --> 00:07:55,661
All right, the Death Eaters have been
trying to recruit me for over a year.

54
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,166
Do you know what that's like?

55
00:07:57,342 --> 00:08:01,089
You can only say no so many times, so
I never stay anywhere more than a week.

56
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:03,592
Muggles who own this
are in the Canary Islands.

57
00:08:03,765 --> 00:08:08,638
Well, I think we should put it back
in order for them, don't you? Mind.

58
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,135
That was fun.

59
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:49,137
- Do you mind if I use the loo?
- No, of course.

60
00:08:50,477 --> 00:08:53,144
Don't think I don't know
why you're here, Albus.

61
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:58,815
The answer's still no.
Absolutely and unequivocally, no.

62
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:09,275
You're very like your father.

63
00:09:10,413 --> 00:09:13,281
- Except for the eyes. You have your...
- My mother's eyes. Yeah.

64
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:17,156
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was
exceedingly bright, your mother.

65
00:09:17,336 --> 00:09:20,667
Even more impressive when one
considers she was Muggle-born.

66
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,410
One of my best friends is Muggle-born.
Best in our year.

67
00:09:23,593 --> 00:09:25,631
Please don't think I'm prejudiced.
No, no.

68
00:09:25,803 --> 00:09:30,012
Your mother was one of my
absolute favorites. Look, there she is.

69
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:31,973
Right at the front.

70
00:09:40,484 --> 00:09:43,436
All mine. Each and every one.

71
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:45,686
Ex-students, I mean.

72
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:52,324
<i>You recognize Barnabas Cuffe,
editor of The Daily Prophet.</i>

73
00:09:53,204 --> 00:09:55,693
Always takes my owl,
should I wish to register an opinion...

74
00:09:55,874 --> 00:09:57,152
...on the news of the day.

75
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:00,994
Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies.

76
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,624
Free tickets whenever I want them.

77
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:06,796
Of course, I haven't been
to a match in some time.

78
00:10:08,512 --> 00:10:10,052
Ah, yes.

79
00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:12,379
Regulus Black.

80
00:10:12,557 --> 00:10:16,505
You no doubt know of his older brother
Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.

81
00:10:16,686 --> 00:10:19,222
I taught the whole Black family,
except Sirius.

82
00:10:19,397 --> 00:10:21,601
It's a shame. Talented boy.

83
00:10:21,774 --> 00:10:27,063
I got Regulus when he came along,
of course, but I'd have liked the set.

84
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:29,143
Horace?

85
00:10:29,865 --> 00:10:31,405
Do you mind if I take this?

86
00:10:35,955 --> 00:10:39,618
- I do love knitting patterns.
- Yes, of course. But you're not leaving?

87
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,908
I think I know a lost cause
when I see one. Regrettable.

88
00:10:43,086 --> 00:10:45,373
I would have considered it
a personal triumph...

89
00:10:45,547 --> 00:10:48,499
...had you consented to return
to Hogwarts. Oh, well.

90
00:10:48,677 --> 00:10:51,675
You're like my friend Mr. Potter here,
one of a kind.

91
00:10:52,305 --> 00:10:54,011
Well, bye-bye, Horace.

92
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:56,335
Bye.

93
00:11:07,111 --> 00:11:09,860
All right. I'll do it.

94
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:14,605
But I want Professor Merrythought's old
office, not the water closet I had before.

95
00:11:14,784 --> 00:11:18,993
And I expect a raise.
These are mad times we live in. Mad!

96
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,412
They are indeed.

97
00:11:25,837 --> 00:11:27,709
Sir, exactly what was all that about?

98
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:32,956
You are talented, famous and powerful.
Everything Horace values.

99
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:36,550
Professor Slughorn is gonna try
to collect you, Harry.

100
00:11:36,723 --> 00:11:39,093
You would be his crowning jewel.

101
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:44,805
That's why he's returning to Hogwarts.
And it's crucial he should return.

102
00:11:45,523 --> 00:11:48,640
I fear I may have stolen
a wondrous night from you, Harry.

103
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:53,857
She was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl.

104
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:57,482
It's all right, sir. I'll go back tomorrow,
make some excuse.

105
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,323
Oh, you'll not be returning
to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.

106
00:12:01,497 --> 00:12:04,495
But, sir, what about Hedwig?
And my trunk?

107
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,333
Both are waiting for you.

108
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,366
Hedwig.

109
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:46,199
Mum?

110
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,956
Ginny, what is it?

111
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:51,617
I was only wondering
when Harry got here.

112
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:55,044
- What? Harry? Harry who?
- Harry Potter, of course.

113
00:12:55,215 --> 00:12:58,379
I think I'd know if Harry Potter
was in my house, wouldn't I?

114
00:12:58,553 --> 00:13:02,051
- His trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl.
- No, dear, I seriously doubt that.

115
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,341
Harry? Did someone say "Harry"?

116
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,474
Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?

117
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:11,680
Of course not. I'd know if my best friend
was in my room, wouldn't I?

118
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,346
- Is that an owl?
- You haven't seen him, have you?

119
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,269
He's wandering about the house.

120
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:18,187
- Really?
- Really.

121
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:20,022
Harry!

122
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:27,953
Harry!

123
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,158
What a lovely surprise.

124
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:37,578
Why didn't you let us know
you were coming?

125
00:13:37,757 --> 00:13:40,590
- I didn't know. Dumbledore.
- Oh, that man.

126
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:43,001
But then, what would we do
without him?

127
00:13:44,264 --> 00:13:46,931
Got a bit of toothpaste.

128
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:55,557
So when did you get here?

129
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:57,439
A few days ago.

130
00:13:58,361 --> 00:14:00,684
Though for a while,
I wasn't sure I was coming.

131
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,777
Mum sort of lost it last week.

132
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:07,909
Said Ginny and I had no business
going back to Hogwarts.

133
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,452
That it's too dangerous.

134
00:14:09,621 --> 00:14:12,454
- Oh, come on.
- She's not alone.

135
00:14:12,624 --> 00:14:15,955
Even my parents, and they're Muggles,
know something bad's happening.

136
00:14:16,128 --> 00:14:19,993
Anyway, Dad stepped in,
told her she was being barmy...

137
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:22,705
...and it took a few days,
but she came around.

138
00:14:24,053 --> 00:14:27,965
But this is Hogwarts we're talking about.
It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?

139
00:14:28,641 --> 00:14:31,842
There's been a lot of talk recently that...

140
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:34,309
...Dumbledore's got a bit old.

141
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,270
Rubbish! Well, he's only...

142
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,015
What is he?

143
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:41,392
Hundred and fifty?
Give or take a few years.

144
00:15:01,464 --> 00:15:05,294
Cissy! You can't do this!
He can't be trusted!

145
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:06,925
The Dark Lord trusts him.

146
00:15:07,096 --> 00:15:10,677
- The Dark Lord's mistaken.
- Pfft.

147
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,200
Run along, Wormtail.

148
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,709
I know I ought not to be here.

149
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:51,594
The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.

150
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:54,431
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,
you ought not to speak.

151
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,845
Put it down, Bella.
We mustn't touch what isn't ours.

152
00:16:02,983 --> 00:16:06,682
As it so happens,
I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.

153
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:08,021
You?

154
00:16:09,114 --> 00:16:11,401
The Dark Lord told you?

155
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:14,527
Your sister doubts me.

156
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,413
Understandable. Over the years
I've played my part well.

157
00:16:18,582 --> 00:16:22,329
So well, I've deceived
one of the greatest wizards of all time.

158
00:16:23,753 --> 00:16:27,665
Dumbledore is a great wizard.
Only a fool would question it.

159
00:16:27,841 --> 00:16:29,748
I don't doubt you, Severus.

160
00:16:29,926 --> 00:16:33,090
You should be honored, Cissy.
As should Draco.

161
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:39,390
He's just a boy.

162
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,268
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.

163
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,563
But it might be possible
for me to help Draco.

164
00:16:50,322 --> 00:16:53,237
- Severus.
- Swear to it.

165
00:16:57,328 --> 00:16:59,734
Make the Unbreakable Vow.

166
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:06,660
It's just empty words.

167
00:17:06,837 --> 00:17:10,038
He'll give it his best effort.

168
00:17:10,216 --> 00:17:12,586
But when it matters most...

169
00:17:14,388 --> 00:17:18,431
...he'll just slither back into his hole.

170
00:17:21,894 --> 00:17:23,516
Coward.

171
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:30,147
Take out your wand.

172
00:17:43,332 --> 00:17:44,492
Will you...

173
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,705
...Severus Snape...

174
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:49,792
...watch over Draco Malfoy...

175
00:17:49,963 --> 00:17:54,788
...as he attempts to fulfill
the Dark Lord's wishes?

176
00:17:55,927 --> 00:17:57,834
I will.

177
00:17:59,222 --> 00:18:02,885
And will you,
to the best of your ability...

178
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,764
...protect him from harm?

179
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,508
I will.

180
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:13,098
And if Draco should fail...

181
00:18:14,237 --> 00:18:18,861
...will you yourself carry out the deed...

182
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:24,025
...the Dark Lord
has ordered Draco to perform?

183
00:18:29,293 --> 00:18:30,785
I will.

184
00:18:53,568 --> 00:18:56,566
Step up! Step up!
We've got Fainting Fancies!

185
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:57,766
Nosebleed Nougats!

186
00:18:57,946 --> 00:19:01,028
- And just in time for school...
- Puking Pastilles!

187
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:05,070
- Into the cauldron, handsome.
- Into the cauldron, handsome.

188
00:19:19,008 --> 00:19:21,923
- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
- A real money spinner, that.

189
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:24,217
Handy if you need
to make a quick getaway.

190
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:26,131
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello, ladies.

191
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:29,591
- Love potions, eh?
- Yeah, they really do work.

192
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:33,100
Then again, the way we hear it, sis,
you're doing just fine on your own.

193
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:34,433
Meaning?

194
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,728
Are you not
currently dating Dean Thomas?

195
00:19:37,194 --> 00:19:38,936
It's none of your business.

196
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,729
How much for this?

197
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,283
- Five Galleons.
- Five Galleons.

198
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,574
- How much for me?
- Five Galleons.

199
00:19:49,747 --> 00:19:50,943
I'm your brother.

200
00:19:51,332 --> 00:19:53,370
- Ten Galleons.
- Ten Galleons.

201
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,951
Come on, let's go.

202
00:19:59,423 --> 00:20:00,831
Hi, Ron.

203
00:20:16,106 --> 00:20:20,149
How are Fred and George
doing it? Half the Alley's closed down.

204
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,890
Fred reckons
people need a laugh these days.

205
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:25,318
I reckon he's right.

206
00:20:27,117 --> 00:20:28,692
Oh, no.

207
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,485
Everyone got their wands
from Ollivander's.

208
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:45,340
Harry?

209
00:20:47,177 --> 00:20:49,251
Is it me, or do Draco and Mummy
look like two people...

210
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,136
...who don't want to be followed?

211
00:22:36,368 --> 00:22:37,694
<i>Quibbler.</i>

212
00:22:39,496 --> 00:22:41,036
<i>Quibbler.</i>

213
00:22:42,957 --> 00:22:47,616
He's lovely. They've been known
to sing on Boxing Day, you know.

214
00:22:47,795 --> 00:22:50,165
<i>- Quibbler?
- Oh, please.</i>

215
00:22:51,382 --> 00:22:53,918
- What's a Wrackspurt?
- They're invisible creatures.

216
00:22:54,092 --> 00:22:57,256
They float in your ears
and make your brain go fuzzy.

217
00:22:57,806 --> 00:22:59,346
<i>Quibbler.</i>

218
00:23:09,817 --> 00:23:12,566
So, what was Draco doing
with that weird-looking cabinet?

219
00:23:12,736 --> 00:23:14,442
And who were all those people?

220
00:23:14,614 --> 00:23:17,731
Don't you see?
It was a ceremony, an initiation.

221
00:23:17,908 --> 00:23:19,815
Stop it, Harry.
I know where you're going.

222
00:23:19,994 --> 00:23:22,483
It's happened. He's one of them.

223
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:24,154
One of what?

224
00:23:24,915 --> 00:23:28,365
Harry is under the impression
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

225
00:23:28,543 --> 00:23:30,498
You're barking.

226
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,791
What would You-Know-Who
want with Malfoy?

227
00:23:32,965 --> 00:23:37,008
Well, then what's he doing in Borgin
and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?

228
00:23:37,176 --> 00:23:39,048
It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.

229
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,085
Look, his father is a Death Eater.
It only makes sense.

230
00:23:43,267 --> 00:23:44,842
Hermione saw it with her own eyes.

231
00:23:45,018 --> 00:23:48,349
I told you, I don't know what I saw.

232
00:23:50,065 --> 00:23:51,605
I need some air.

233
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:12,115
Don't worry. When we get
to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out.

234
00:24:32,523 --> 00:24:35,771
- What was that? Blaise?
- Don't know.

235
00:24:35,943 --> 00:24:39,060
Relax, boys. It's probably just
a first-year messing around.

236
00:24:39,238 --> 00:24:42,605
Come on, Draco. Sit down.
We'll be at Hogwarts soon.

237
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:56,074
Hogwarts.
What a pathetic excuse for a school.

238
00:24:56,254 --> 00:24:58,245
I'd pitch myself off
the Astronomy Tower...

239
00:24:58,423 --> 00:25:00,544
...if I had to continue
for another two years.

240
00:25:00,717 --> 00:25:02,043
What's that supposed to mean?

241
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:07,132
Let's just say you won't see me wasting
my time in Charms class next year.

242
00:25:08,934 --> 00:25:10,759
Amused, Blaise?

243
00:25:12,229 --> 00:25:14,635
We'll see just who's laughing in the end.

244
00:25:36,793 --> 00:25:40,540
You two go on.
I wanna check something.

245
00:25:42,716 --> 00:25:43,994
Where's Harry?

246
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:47,128
He's probably already on the platform.
Come on.

247
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:06,317
Didn't Mummy ever tell you
it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?

248
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:08,064
<i>Petrificus Totalus.</i>

249
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,453
...she was dead before you could wipe
the drool off your chin.

250
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,134
That's for my father.
Enjoy your ride back to London.

251
00:27:16,975 --> 00:27:18,717
<i>Finite.</i>

252
00:27:24,858 --> 00:27:26,136
- Hello, Harry.
- Luna!

253
00:27:26,526 --> 00:27:31,232
- How'd you know where I was?
- Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.

254
00:27:37,954 --> 00:27:40,621
Sorry I made you miss
the carriages, by the way, Luna.

255
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:43,953
That's all right.
It was like being with a friend.

256
00:27:44,126 --> 00:27:46,164
Oh, I am your friend, Luna.

257
00:27:46,587 --> 00:27:48,377
That's nice.

258
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:51,748
About time. I've been looking
all over for you two.

259
00:27:51,925 --> 00:27:54,758
Right. Names?

260
00:27:55,012 --> 00:27:57,382
Professor Flitwick,
you've known me for five years.

261
00:27:57,556 --> 00:27:59,677
No exceptions, Potter.

262
00:28:00,226 --> 00:28:01,968
Who are those people?

263
00:28:02,144 --> 00:28:04,431
Aurors. For security.

264
00:28:04,606 --> 00:28:06,062
What's this cane here, then?

265
00:28:06,357 --> 00:28:08,597
It's not a cane, you cretin.
It's a walking stick.

266
00:28:08,776 --> 00:28:12,772
And what exactly would you
be wanting with a...?

267
00:28:13,947 --> 00:28:17,029
Could be construed
as an offensive weapon.

268
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:22,442
It's all right, Mr. Filch.
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.

269
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:31,793
Nice face, Potter.

270
00:28:38,346 --> 00:28:40,669
Would you like me to fix it for you?

271
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:44,631
Personally, I think you look
a bit more devil-may-care this way...

272
00:28:44,812 --> 00:28:46,352
...but it's up to you.

273
00:28:46,772 --> 00:28:49,059
Well, have you ever fixed a nose before?

274
00:28:49,232 --> 00:28:52,931
No, but I've done several toes,
and how different are they, really?

275
00:28:53,987 --> 00:28:57,899
Um... Okay, yeah. Give it a go.

276
00:29:00,326 --> 00:29:02,364
<i>- Episkey.
- Ah!</i>

277
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:11,665
- How do I look?
- Exceptionally ordinary.

278
00:29:12,796 --> 00:29:14,169
Brilliant.

279
00:29:21,555 --> 00:29:23,593
Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.

280
00:29:27,478 --> 00:29:30,181
Will you stop eating?

281
00:29:30,356 --> 00:29:32,596
Your best friend is missing!

282
00:29:32,775 --> 00:29:36,023
Oi. Turn around, you lunatic.

283
00:29:38,822 --> 00:29:40,314
He's covered in blood again.

284
00:29:40,949 --> 00:29:44,731
- Why is it he's always covered in blood?
- Looks like it's his own this time.

285
00:29:45,204 --> 00:29:47,076
Where have you been?

286
00:29:47,247 --> 00:29:49,701
- What happened to your face?
- Later.

287
00:29:49,874 --> 00:29:51,496
What've I missed?

288
00:29:52,043 --> 00:29:55,825
Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave
and strong in these troubled times.

289
00:29:56,005 --> 00:29:59,538
Easy for it to say, huh?
It's a hat, isn't it?

290
00:30:07,392 --> 00:30:09,098
Very best of evenings to you all.

291
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:10,298
Thanks.

292
00:30:12,522 --> 00:30:17,181
First off, let me introduce
the newest member of our staff...

293
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,600
...Horace Slughorn.

294
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,362
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say...

295
00:30:25,535 --> 00:30:29,827
...has agreed to resume
his old post as Potions Master.

296
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:32,912
Meanwhile, the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts...

297
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,873
...will be taken by Professor Snape.

298
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:36,749
Snape?

299
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:44,423
Now, as you know...

300
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:48,257
...each and every one of you was searched
upon your arrival here tonight.

301
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:50,423
And you have the right to know why.

302
00:30:51,227 --> 00:30:54,808
Once there was a young man,
who, like you...

303
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,434
...sat in this very hall...

304
00:30:57,816 --> 00:31:02,440
...walked this castle's corridors,
slept under its roof.

305
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:07,404
He seemed to all the world
a student like any other.

306
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:09,116
His name?

307
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:11,905
Tom Riddle.

308
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,741
Today, of course...

309
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:22,626
...he's known all over the world
by another name.

310
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:29,004
Which is why, as I stand looking out
upon you all tonight...

311
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,550
...I'm reminded of a sobering fact.

312
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:35,843
Every day, every hour...

313
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:37,976
...this very minute, perhaps...

314
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:42,474
...dark forces attempt to penetrate
this castle's walls.

315
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:49,650
But in the end,
their greatest weapon is you.

316
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:54,824
Just something to think about.

317
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,656
Now, off to bed. Pip-pip.

318
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:01,125
That was cheerful.

319
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:11,168
History of Magic is upstairs,
ladies, not down.

320
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:16,964
Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies!
That is the girls' lavatory.

321
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:21,181
Potter.

322
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:24,480
Oh, this can't be good.

323
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,153
Enjoying ourselves, are we?

324
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:33,275
- I had a free period this morning.
- So I noticed.

325
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:36,192
I would think you would want to
fill it with Potions.

326
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:39,039
Or is it no longer your ambition
to become an Auror?

327
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:43,449
It was, but I was told I had to
get an "Outstanding" in my O.W.L.

328
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,496
So you did, when Professor Snape
was teaching Potions.

329
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:51,249
However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly
happy to accept N.E.W.T. s students...

330
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,218
...with "Exceeds Expectations."

331
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,378
Brilliant. Um...

332
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,010
- Well, I'll head there straightaway.
- Oh, good, good.

333
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:03,094
Potter, take Weasley with you.
He looks far too happy over there.

334
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,178
I don't wanna take Potions.

335
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,063
This is Quidditch trials coming up.
I need to practice.

336
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,277
Attention to detail
in the preparation...

337
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,735
...is the prerequisite of all planning.

338
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:21,699
Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry.
We've brought someone with us, I see.

339
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,529
Ron Weasley, sir.

340
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,539
But I'm dead awful at Potions,
a menace, actually.

341
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,787
- I'm gonna...
- Nonsense, we'll sort you out.

342
00:33:28,964 --> 00:33:32,046
Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.
Get your books out.

343
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,754
I haven't actually got
my book yet, and nor has Ron.

344
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,635
Get what you want from the cupboard.

345
00:33:36,805 --> 00:33:40,136
Now, as I was saying,
I prepared some concoctions this morning.

346
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:44,258
Any ideas what these might be?

347
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,344
- Yes, Miss...?
- Granger, sir.

348
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:56,070
That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.

349
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:58,944
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

350
00:34:02,581 --> 00:34:04,238
It's terribly tricky to make.

351
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,454
And this is Amortentia...

352
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,033
...the most powerful
love potion in the world.

353
00:34:09,963 --> 00:34:13,793
It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

354
00:34:15,093 --> 00:34:17,084
For example, I smell...

355
00:34:17,845 --> 00:34:21,888
...freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...

356
00:34:22,058 --> 00:34:25,389
...spearmint toothpaste.

357
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:30,264
Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.

358
00:34:30,442 --> 00:34:35,434
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

359
00:34:35,614 --> 00:34:42,278
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

360
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:50,618
Sir? You haven't told us
what's in that one.

361
00:34:51,003 --> 00:34:52,709
Oh, yes.

362
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,451
What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen...

363
00:34:55,633 --> 00:35:01,052
...is a curious little potion
known as Felix Felicis.

364
00:35:01,471 --> 00:35:03,711
But it is more commonly referred to as...

365
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:09,180
- Liquid luck.
- Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.

366
00:35:09,688 --> 00:35:12,686
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.

367
00:35:13,483 --> 00:35:18,475
One sip and you will find
that all of your endeavors succeed.

368
00:35:20,533 --> 00:35:23,022
At least until the effects wear off.

369
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:27,699
So this is what I offer each of you today.

370
00:35:27,873 --> 00:35:32,698
One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student
who, in the hour that remains...

371
00:35:32,877 --> 00:35:37,453
...manages to brew an acceptable
Draught of Living Death...

372
00:35:37,632 --> 00:35:40,880
...the recipes for which can be found
on page 10 of your books.

373
00:35:41,052 --> 00:35:44,715
I should point out, however, only once did
a student manage to brew a potion...

374
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:48,220
...of sufficient quality to claim this prize.

375
00:35:48,894 --> 00:35:51,051
Nevertheless, good luck to you all.

376
00:35:51,938 --> 00:35:53,728
Let the brewing commence.

377
00:35:58,444 --> 00:36:00,537
this book is the property of the half blood prince

378
00:36:22,426 --> 00:36:25,031
cut the sopophorus bean

379
00:36:29,558 --> 00:36:31,383
How did you do that?

380
00:36:31,935 --> 00:36:34,092
You crush it. Don't cut it.

381
00:36:34,272 --> 00:36:36,761
No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.

382
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,765
No, really.

383
00:37:16,271 --> 00:37:19,435
Merlin's beard! It is perfect.

384
00:37:20,942 --> 00:37:24,143
So perfect I daresay
one drop would kill us all.

385
00:37:27,448 --> 00:37:29,403
So here we are, then, as promised.

386
00:37:29,575 --> 00:37:32,776
One vial of Felix Felicis.

387
00:37:32,954 --> 00:37:34,992
Congratulations.

388
00:37:35,497 --> 00:37:38,246
Use it well.

389
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,527
Harry, you got my message. Come in.

390
00:38:10,198 --> 00:38:11,571
How are you?

391
00:38:11,741 --> 00:38:13,281
I'm fine, sir.

392
00:38:13,451 --> 00:38:14,694
Enjoying your classes?

393
00:38:15,953 --> 00:38:18,987
I know Professor Slughorn
is most impressed with you.

394
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:21,995
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.

395
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,822
Do you?

396
00:38:24,378 --> 00:38:25,621
Definitely.

397
00:38:27,631 --> 00:38:30,464
What about your activities
outside the classroom?

398
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:33,668
- Sir?
- Well, I notice you spend...

399
00:38:33,846 --> 00:38:36,465
...a great deal of time with Miss Granger.

400
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,883
I can't help wondering...

401
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:43,051
Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant,
and we're friends, but, no.

402
00:38:43,231 --> 00:38:46,229
Forgive me. I was merely being curious.

403
00:38:47,318 --> 00:38:49,190
But enough chitchat.

404
00:38:49,403 --> 00:38:52,984
You must be wondering
why I summoned you here tonight.

405
00:38:53,574 --> 00:38:56,407
The answer lies here.

406
00:38:57,411 --> 00:38:59,568
What you are looking at are memories.

407
00:38:59,746 --> 00:39:03,576
In this case,
pertaining to one individual, Voldemort...

408
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,204
...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.

409
00:39:09,255 --> 00:39:13,085
This vial contains
the most particular memory...

410
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,464
...of the day I first met him.

411
00:39:16,805 --> 00:39:19,590
I'd like you to see it, if you would.

412
00:39:57,219 --> 00:40:01,464
<i>I admit some confusion upon
receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.</i>

413
00:39:59,304 --> 00:40:01,388
wool's orphan

414
00:40:01,806 --> 00:40:05,256
In all the years Tom's been here,
he's never once had a family visitor.

415
00:40:05,435 --> 00:40:09,182
There have been incidents
with the other children. Nasty things.

416
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:13,765
Tom, you have a visitor.

417
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,977
How do you do, Tom?

418
00:40:23,495 --> 00:40:24,738
Don't.

419
00:40:32,545 --> 00:40:35,662
- You're the doctor, aren't you?
- No.

420
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,878
I am a professor.

421
00:40:38,592 --> 00:40:40,417
I don't believe you.

422
00:40:40,595 --> 00:40:42,586
She wants me looked at.

423
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,384
They think I'm different.

424
00:40:45,558 --> 00:40:47,050
Well, perhaps they're right.

425
00:40:47,226 --> 00:40:48,682
I'm not mad.

426
00:40:48,853 --> 00:40:52,184
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.

427
00:40:52,357 --> 00:40:54,348
Hogwarts is a school.

428
00:40:55,109 --> 00:40:56,269
A school of magic.

429
00:41:00,782 --> 00:41:03,531
You can do things, can't you, Tom?

430
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,327
Things other children can't.

431
00:41:08,704 --> 00:41:11,656
I can make things move
without touching them.

432
00:41:12,584 --> 00:41:16,165
I can make animals do what I want
without training them.

433
00:41:16,962 --> 00:41:20,495
I can make bad things happen
to people who are mean to me.

434
00:41:21,134 --> 00:41:23,089
I can make them hurt...

435
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:25,259
...if I want.

436
00:41:25,805 --> 00:41:27,677
Who are you?

437
00:41:27,848 --> 00:41:30,052
Well, I'm like you, Tom.

438
00:41:31,226 --> 00:41:32,682
I'm different.

439
00:41:33,729 --> 00:41:35,137
Prove it.

440
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:46,569
I think there's something in your wardrobe
trying to get out, Tom.

441
00:41:56,293 --> 00:42:00,075
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts,
Tom.

442
00:42:00,255 --> 00:42:05,923
At Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only
how to use magic, but how to control it.

443
00:42:06,094 --> 00:42:07,254
You understand me?

444
00:42:11,224 --> 00:42:13,760
I can speak to snakes too.

445
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,810
They find me.

446
00:42:17,815 --> 00:42:19,722
Whisper things.

447
00:42:19,983 --> 00:42:23,100
Is that normal for someone like me?

448
00:42:44,173 --> 00:42:47,456
Did you know, sir? Then?

449
00:42:47,634 --> 00:42:53,255
Did I know I'd just met the most
dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.

450
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:55,970
If I had, I...

451
00:42:57,602 --> 00:43:00,056
Over time, while here at Hogwarts...

452
00:43:00,231 --> 00:43:03,562
...Tom Riddle grew close
to one particular teacher.

453
00:43:03,734 --> 00:43:05,559
Can you guess
who that teacher might be?

454
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:11,939
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back
simply to teach Potions, did you?

455
00:43:12,117 --> 00:43:14,155
No, I did not.

456
00:43:14,327 --> 00:43:18,157
You see, Professor Slughorn possesses
something I desire very dearly.

457
00:43:19,165 --> 00:43:21,037
And he will not give it up easily.

458
00:43:21,209 --> 00:43:24,410
You said Professor Slughorn
would try to collect me.

459
00:43:24,587 --> 00:43:25,830
I did.

460
00:43:26,548 --> 00:43:28,539
Do you want me to let him?

461
00:43:29,926 --> 00:43:31,299
Yes.

462
00:44:55,468 --> 00:44:57,174
All right. Um...

463
00:44:57,345 --> 00:45:00,427
This morning, I'm gonna be
putting you all through a few drills...

464
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:02,719
...just to assess your strengths.

465
00:45:03,433 --> 00:45:05,424
Quiet! Please!

466
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:06,763
Shut it!

467
00:45:10,609 --> 00:45:13,358
Thanks. All right. Um...

468
00:45:13,527 --> 00:45:15,648
Just because you
made the team last year...

469
00:45:15,822 --> 00:45:18,774
...does not guarantee you a spot this year.
Is that clear?

470
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:22,563
Good.

471
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:33,499
No hard feelings, Weasley, all right?

472
00:45:34,048 --> 00:45:35,244
Hard feelings?

473
00:45:35,424 --> 00:45:38,957
Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well.
It's nothing personal.

474
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:41,803
Really? Strapping guy like you?

475
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:44,542
You've got more of a Beater's build,
don't you think?

476
00:45:44,724 --> 00:45:47,130
Keepers need to be quick, agile.

477
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:50,309
Oh, I like my chances.

478
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:54,263
Say, think you could introduce me
to your friend Granger?

479
00:45:54,443 --> 00:45:58,604
Wouldn't mind getting on
a first-name basis, know what I mean?

480
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:12,623
Come on, Weasley!

481
00:46:12,794 --> 00:46:14,500
- Come on, Ron!
- Go on, Weasley!

482
00:46:16,047 --> 00:46:18,915
- Go on, Weasley!
- Yeah, Ron!

483
00:46:19,092 --> 00:46:20,335
Go on, Cormac!

484
00:46:36,859 --> 00:46:38,933
Come on, Ron!

485
00:46:49,622 --> 00:46:51,494
Come on, Ron.

486
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:10,551
<i>Confundus.</i>

487
00:47:26,658 --> 00:47:28,981
Isn't he brilliant?

488
00:47:31,746 --> 00:47:35,244
I have to admit, I thought
I was gonna miss that last one.

489
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:38,368
I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.

490
00:47:38,794 --> 00:47:41,828
He's got a bit of a thing for you,
Hermione. Cormac.

491
00:47:42,924 --> 00:47:44,915
He's vile.

492
00:47:49,889 --> 00:47:52,129
Have you ever heard of this spell?
Sectumsempra?

493
00:47:52,307 --> 00:47:54,381
No, I haven't.

494
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,677
And if you had a shred of self-respect,
you'd hand that book in.

495
00:47:57,856 --> 00:48:00,310
Not bloody likely. He's top of the class.

496
00:48:00,484 --> 00:48:04,645
He's even better than you, Hermione.
Slughorn thinks he's a genius.

497
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,058
What?

498
00:48:07,908 --> 00:48:10,611
I'd like to know whose that book was.
Let's have a look.

499
00:48:10,785 --> 00:48:12,277
No.

500
00:48:13,788 --> 00:48:15,066
Why not?

501
00:48:15,623 --> 00:48:17,245
The binding is fragile.

502
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:20,035
- The binding is fragile?
- Yeah.

503
00:48:24,298 --> 00:48:25,873
- Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
- Who?

504
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:29,797
That's what it says right here: "This book
is property of the Half-Blood Prince."

505
00:48:47,154 --> 00:48:50,485
<i>For weeks you carry around
this book, practically sleep with it...</i>

506
00:48:50,658 --> 00:48:52,945
<i>... yet you have no desire to find out
who he is?</i>

507
00:48:53,118 --> 00:48:56,532
I didn't say I wasn't curious,
and I don't sleep with it.

508
00:48:56,705 --> 00:48:57,734
Well, it's true.

509
00:48:57,914 --> 00:49:01,661
I like a nice chat before I go to bed.
Now all you do is read that bloody book.

510
00:49:01,835 --> 00:49:03,826
It's just like being with Hermione.

511
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:07,619
Well, I was curious, so I went to...

512
00:49:07,799 --> 00:49:10,335
- The library.
- The library. And?

513
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,882
And nothing.

514
00:49:13,054 --> 00:49:16,088
I couldn't find a reference anywhere
to a Half-Blood Prince.

515
00:49:16,265 --> 00:49:18,339
- There we go. That settles it, then.
- Filius!

516
00:49:18,518 --> 00:49:20,841
I was hoping to find you
in the Three Broomsticks!

517
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:25,679
No, emergency choir practice,
I'm afraid, Horace.

518
00:49:29,195 --> 00:49:31,601
Does anyone fancy a Butterbeer?

519
00:49:31,948 --> 00:49:34,188
A chum of mine
was sledging down Claxby Hill.

520
00:49:34,367 --> 00:49:37,983
We had a very long, homemade,
Norwegian-style sledge...

521
00:49:38,162 --> 00:49:40,616
No, not there. Over here.

522
00:49:41,248 --> 00:49:42,788
No, sit beside me.

523
00:49:44,543 --> 00:49:45,821
Okay.

524
00:49:47,296 --> 00:49:48,669
Something to drink?

525
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:51,375
Three Butterbeers,
and some ginger in mine, please.

526
00:50:03,144 --> 00:50:05,099
Oh, bloody hell.

527
00:50:08,067 --> 00:50:09,892
Slick git.

528
00:50:10,235 --> 00:50:12,902
Honestly, Ronald,
they're only holding hands.

529
00:50:15,741 --> 00:50:16,984
And snogging.

530
00:50:17,659 --> 00:50:20,611
- I'd like to leave.
- What?

531
00:50:20,788 --> 00:50:22,363
You can't be serious.

532
00:50:22,539 --> 00:50:24,909
- That happens to be my sister.
- So?

533
00:50:25,083 --> 00:50:28,995
What if she looked over here and saw you
snogging me? You expect her to leave?

534
00:50:30,296 --> 00:50:32,750
- Hey, my boy!
- Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.

535
00:50:32,924 --> 00:50:34,915
And you, and you.

536
00:50:35,092 --> 00:50:36,882
So, what brings you here?

537
00:50:37,052 --> 00:50:41,758
The Three Broomsticks and I go way back,
further than I care to admit.

538
00:50:41,932 --> 00:50:45,382
I can remember
when it was One Broomstick.

539
00:50:45,561 --> 00:50:48,892
All hands on deck, Granger.
Listen, my boy, in the old days...

540
00:50:49,065 --> 00:50:52,479
...I used to throw together
the occasional supper party...

541
00:50:52,652 --> 00:50:54,856
...for the select student or two.

542
00:50:55,029 --> 00:50:58,894
- Would you be game?
- I'd consider it an honor, sir.

543
00:51:00,326 --> 00:51:02,530
You would be welcome too, Granger.

544
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:08,072
- I'd be delighted, sir.
- Splendid. Look for my owl.

545
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,915
Good to see you, Wallenby.

546
00:51:15,841 --> 00:51:17,547
What are you playing at?

547
00:51:19,344 --> 00:51:21,667
Dumbledore's asked me
to get to know him.

548
00:51:21,846 --> 00:51:23,801
- Get to know him?
- I don't know.

549
00:51:23,973 --> 00:51:27,720
It must be important.
If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.

550
00:51:33,317 --> 00:51:35,438
Got a little bit...

551
00:51:46,329 --> 00:51:48,201
Katie, you don't know what it could be.

552
00:51:48,373 --> 00:51:49,829
- Harry.
- What?

553
00:51:49,999 --> 00:51:53,497
Did you hear what she said back
at the pub about me and her snogging?

554
00:51:54,296 --> 00:51:56,038
As if.

555
00:52:02,469 --> 00:52:05,800
I warned her.
I warned her not to touch it.

556
00:52:27,286 --> 00:52:30,035
Don't get any closer.
Get back, all of you.

557
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:47,375
Do not touch that, except by
the wrappings. Do you understand?

558
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,431
You're sure Katie did not have this
in her possession...

559
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:06,102
...when she entered
the Three Broomsticks?

560
00:53:06,742 --> 00:53:08,282
It's like I said.

561
00:53:08,493 --> 00:53:13,402
She left to go to the loo, and when
she came back she had the package.

562
00:53:14,666 --> 00:53:17,369
She said it was important
that she deliver it.

563
00:53:18,211 --> 00:53:21,709
- Did she say to whom?
- To Professor Dumbledore.

564
00:53:22,048 --> 00:53:24,715
Very well. Thank you, Leanne.
You may go.

565
00:53:29,429 --> 00:53:34,931
Why is it when something happens
it is always you three?

566
00:53:36,019 --> 00:53:40,429
Believe me, professor, I've been asking
myself the same question for six years.

567
00:53:40,982 --> 00:53:42,557
McGONAGALL:
Oh, Severus.

568
00:53:48,282 --> 00:53:50,154
What do you think?

569
00:53:52,077 --> 00:53:56,867
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.

570
00:53:57,041 --> 00:53:59,281
She was cursed, wasn't she?

571
00:53:59,459 --> 00:54:02,126
I know Katie. Off the pitch,
she wouldn't hurt a fly.

572
00:54:02,629 --> 00:54:06,210
If she was delivering that to Dumbledore,
she wasn't doing it knowingly.

573
00:54:06,382 --> 00:54:08,289
Yes, she was cursed.

574
00:54:09,094 --> 00:54:10,751
It was Malfoy.

575
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,462
That is a very serious accusation, Potter.

576
00:54:16,643 --> 00:54:18,135
Indeed.

577
00:54:18,978 --> 00:54:22,392
- Your evidence?
- I just know.

578
00:54:23,148 --> 00:54:25,139
You just...

579
00:54:26,361 --> 00:54:27,769
...know.

580
00:54:30,824 --> 00:54:32,731
You astonish with your gifts, Potter.

581
00:54:32,909 --> 00:54:36,857
Gifts mere mortals
can only dream of possessing.

582
00:54:37,038 --> 00:54:43,156
How grand it must be
to be the Chosen One.

583
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,338
I suggest you go back to your dormitories.
All of you.

584
00:55:01,853 --> 00:55:04,768
What do you suppose
Dean sees in her? Ginny?

585
00:55:06,482 --> 00:55:08,473
Well, what does she see in him?

586
00:55:08,653 --> 00:55:10,857
Dean? He's brilliant.

587
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:13,863
You called him a slick git
not five hours ago.

588
00:55:14,033 --> 00:55:17,815
Yeah, well, he was running his hands
all over my sister, wasn't he?

589
00:55:17,994 --> 00:55:22,535
Something snaps, and you've gotta
hate him, you know? On principle.

590
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:24,700
I suppose.

591
00:55:25,961 --> 00:55:29,125
- So, what is it he sees in her?
- I don't know.

592
00:55:29,881 --> 00:55:32,287
She's smart, funny.

593
00:55:33,051 --> 00:55:35,338
- Attractive.
- Attractive?

594
00:55:36,887 --> 00:55:40,385
- You know, she's got nice skin.
- Skin?

595
00:55:41,225 --> 00:55:43,050
Dean dates my sister
because of her skin?

596
00:55:43,227 --> 00:55:47,721
Well, no, I mean, I'm just saying
it could be a contributing factor.

597
00:55:51,111 --> 00:55:52,853
Hermione's got nice skin.

598
00:55:53,571 --> 00:55:56,320
Wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean.

599
00:55:57,284 --> 00:55:59,358
I've never really thought about it.

600
00:56:00,912 --> 00:56:02,618
But, I suppose, yeah.

601
00:56:03,372 --> 00:56:04,828
Very nice.

602
00:56:09,253 --> 00:56:12,620
- I think I'll be going to sleep now.
- Right. Yeah.

603
00:56:22,474 --> 00:56:26,422
So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything
of your Uncle Tiberius these days?

604
00:56:26,603 --> 00:56:29,092
Yes, sir. In fact,
I'm meant to go hunting with him...

605
00:56:29,272 --> 00:56:31,476
...and the Minister for Magic
over the holidays.

606
00:56:31,649 --> 00:56:34,601
Well, be sure to give them both my best.

607
00:56:34,778 --> 00:56:36,769
What about your uncle, Belby?

608
00:56:36,947 --> 00:56:40,397
For those who don't know, Marcus'
uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.

609
00:56:40,575 --> 00:56:43,360
- Is he working on anything new?
- Don't know.

610
00:56:43,536 --> 00:56:47,614
Him and Dad don't get on. Probably
because me dad says potions are rubbish.

611
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:51,074
Says the only potion worth having
is a stiff one at the end of the day.

612
00:56:51,253 --> 00:56:56,376
What about you, Miss Granger? What does
your family do in the Muggle world?

613
00:56:57,133 --> 00:56:58,958
My parents are dentists.

614
00:57:03,514 --> 00:57:04,792
They tend to people's teeth.

615
00:57:04,974 --> 00:57:09,717
Fascinating. And is that considered
a dangerous profession?

616
00:57:09,895 --> 00:57:11,173
No.

617
00:57:13,148 --> 00:57:17,642
Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick,
did bite my father once.

618
00:57:17,821 --> 00:57:19,064
He needed 10 stitches.

619
00:57:25,327 --> 00:57:28,943
Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.

620
00:57:31,667 --> 00:57:36,077
Look at her eyes.
They've been fighting again, her and Dean.

621
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,958
Sorry. I'm not usually late.

622
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:47,170
No matter. You're just in time for dessert,
that is, if Belby's left you any.

623
00:57:55,106 --> 00:57:56,183
What?

624
00:57:56,357 --> 00:57:57,979
Nothing.

625
00:58:04,324 --> 00:58:07,940
Goodbye. Bye-bye.

626
00:58:12,832 --> 00:58:14,574
- Potter.
- I'm sorry, sir.

627
00:58:14,751 --> 00:58:17,322
I was just admiring your hourglass.

628
00:58:18,713 --> 00:58:20,169
Oh, yes.

629
00:58:20,715 --> 00:58:22,753
A most intriguing object.

630
00:58:23,426 --> 00:58:27,671
The sand runs in accordance
with the quality of the conversation.

631
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:31,219
If it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly.

632
00:58:31,725 --> 00:58:33,632
- If it is not...
- I think I'll be going.

633
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:37,142
Nonsense.
You have nothing to fear, dear boy.

634
00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:39,554
As to some of your classmates...

635
00:58:39,732 --> 00:58:43,146
...well, let's just say they're unlikely
to make the shelf.

636
00:58:43,321 --> 00:58:44,813
The shelf, sir?

637
00:58:45,406 --> 00:58:49,022
Anyone who aspires to be anyone
hopes to end up here.

638
00:58:49,201 --> 00:58:53,066
But then again, you already are someone,
aren't you, Harry?

639
00:58:54,623 --> 00:58:56,578
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?

640
00:58:58,752 --> 00:59:02,664
You knew him, didn't you, sir,
Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.

641
00:59:03,757 --> 00:59:07,255
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers
whilst here at Hogwarts.

642
00:59:07,427 --> 00:59:09,002
What was he like?

643
00:59:12,723 --> 00:59:15,093
I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.

644
00:59:15,768 --> 00:59:17,593
He killed my parents.

645
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:21,634
Of course.

646
00:59:22,024 --> 00:59:25,022
It's only natural
you should want to know more.

647
00:59:27,114 --> 00:59:29,947
But I'm afraid I must disappoint you,
Harry.

648
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:33,107
When I first met Mr. Riddle,
he was a quiet...

649
00:59:33,285 --> 00:59:37,530
...albeit brilliant, boy committed
to becoming a first-rate wizard.

650
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:39,449
Not unlike others I've known.

651
00:59:40,042 --> 00:59:42,116
Not unlike yourself, in fact.

652
00:59:43,462 --> 00:59:45,536
If the monster existed...

653
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:48,330
...it was buried deep within.

654
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:07,142
Good luck, eh, Ron.

655
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:11,024
- Nice hat!
- Ron, you're a loser.

656
01:00:11,198 --> 01:00:14,280
I'm counting on you, Ron.
I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?

657
01:00:14,451 --> 01:00:16,774
- Looking good, Ron.
- Loser!

658
01:00:18,997 --> 01:00:20,489
What's he wearing?

659
01:00:29,132 --> 01:00:30,957
So how was it, then?

660
01:00:32,177 --> 01:00:34,500
- How was what?
- Your dinner party?

661
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:36,301
Pretty boring, actually.

662
01:00:37,097 --> 01:00:39,420
Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.

663
01:00:42,853 --> 01:00:45,602
Slughorn's having a Christmas do,
you know.

664
01:00:45,773 --> 01:00:47,313
And we're meant to bring someone.

665
01:00:47,483 --> 01:00:51,182
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen.
He's in the Slug Club, isn't he?

666
01:00:51,362 --> 01:00:54,195
- Actually, I was going to ask you.
- Really?

667
01:00:57,034 --> 01:00:59,025
Good luck today, Ron.

668
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:02,193
I know you'll be brilliant.

669
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:08,997
I'm resigning. After today's match,
McLaggen can have my spot.

670
01:01:09,171 --> 01:01:10,663
Have it your way.

671
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,329
- Juice?
- Sure.

672
01:01:13,508 --> 01:01:15,214
Hello, everyone.

673
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:18,544
You look dreadful, Ron.

674
01:01:18,722 --> 01:01:21,092
Is that why you put something
in his cup?

675
01:01:23,309 --> 01:01:24,931
Is it a tonic?

676
01:01:28,398 --> 01:01:30,020
Liquid luck.

677
01:01:31,401 --> 01:01:33,058
Don't drink it, Ron.

678
01:01:40,659 --> 01:01:44,026
- You could be expelled for that.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

679
01:01:46,248 --> 01:01:48,867
Come on, Harry.
We've got a game to win.

680
01:02:15,026 --> 01:02:17,859
Go on, Ron! Do it!

681
01:02:51,812 --> 01:02:54,099
<i>Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</i>

682
01:02:56,107 --> 01:02:59,557
<i>Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</i>

683
01:03:09,872 --> 01:03:14,912
<i>Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</i>

684
01:03:19,172 --> 01:03:20,878
You really shouldn't have done it.

685
01:03:21,049 --> 01:03:26,041
I know. I suppose I could've
just used a Confundus Charm.

686
01:03:27,055 --> 01:03:31,679
That was different. That was tryouts.
This was an actual game.

687
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:36,184
You didn't put it in.

688
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:39,723
Ron only thought you did.

689
01:04:27,532 --> 01:04:30,815
Charms spell. I'm just practicing.

690
01:04:34,747 --> 01:04:36,572
Well, they're really good.

691
01:04:42,088 --> 01:04:44,079
How does it feel, Harry?

692
01:04:46,926 --> 01:04:50,127
When you see Dean with Ginny?

693
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:56,681
I know.

694
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:59,926
I see the way you look at her.

695
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,269
You're my best friend.

696
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:13,191
Oops.

697
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:16,860
I think this room's taken.

698
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,031
What's with the birds?

699
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,125
<i>Oppugno.</i>

700
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:54,863
It feels like this.

701
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:37,607
Look, I can't help it
if she's got her knickers in a twist.

702
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:42,860
What Lav and I have, well,
let's just say, there's no stopping it.

703
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:44,447
It's chemical.

704
01:06:44,624 --> 01:06:48,951
Will it last? Who knows?
Point is, I'm a free agent.

705
01:06:49,128 --> 01:06:51,961
He's at perfect liberty
to kiss whoever he likes.

706
01:06:52,131 --> 01:06:54,537
I really couldn't care less.

707
01:06:54,717 --> 01:06:58,547
Was I under the impression he and I would
be attending Slughorn's Christmas party?

708
01:06:58,721 --> 01:07:00,213
Yes.

709
01:07:00,389 --> 01:07:04,799
Now, given the circumstances,
I've had to make other arrangements.

710
01:07:04,977 --> 01:07:06,173
Have you?

711
01:07:06,353 --> 01:07:08,344
Yes. Why?

712
01:07:08,522 --> 01:07:12,138
I just thought, seeing as neither of us
can go with who we'd really like to...

713
01:07:12,317 --> 01:07:14,557
...we should go together, as friends.

714
01:07:14,736 --> 01:07:16,358
Why didn't I think of that?

715
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:18,070
Who are you going with?

716
01:07:18,241 --> 01:07:20,031
Um, it's a surprise.

717
01:07:20,201 --> 01:07:24,410
Anyway, it's you we've got to worry
about. You can't just take anyone.

718
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:26,911
See that girl over there?

719
01:07:28,542 --> 01:07:33,248
That's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's
trying to smuggle you a love potion.

720
01:07:33,422 --> 01:07:34,914
Really?

721
01:07:35,882 --> 01:07:39,332
Hey! She's only interested in you because
she thinks you're the Chosen One.

722
01:07:39,511 --> 01:07:41,217
But I am the Chosen One.

723
01:07:41,388 --> 01:07:44,256
Okay, sorry. Um, kidding.

724
01:07:46,268 --> 01:07:47,724
I'll ask someone I like.

725
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:50,060
Someone cool.

726
01:07:59,823 --> 01:08:02,857
I've never been to this part of the castle.

727
01:08:03,035 --> 01:08:06,283
At least not while awake.
I sleepwalk, you see.

728
01:08:06,455 --> 01:08:08,944
That's why I wear shoes to bed.

729
01:08:40,153 --> 01:08:43,151
<i>Harmonia Nectere Passus.
（detailed explanation，see http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Harmonia_Nectare_Passus）</i>

730
01:08:55,669 --> 01:08:58,418
<i>Harmonia Nectere Passus.</i>

731
01:08:59,965 --> 01:09:02,632
<i>Harmonia Nectere Passus.</i>

732
01:09:17,273 --> 01:09:18,681
Drink?

733
01:09:19,608 --> 01:09:20,934
Neville.

734
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:22,566
I didn't get into the Slug Club.

735
01:09:22,736 --> 01:09:25,853
It's okay, though. He's got Belby
handing out towels in the loo.

736
01:09:26,032 --> 01:09:28,817
- Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks.
- Okay.

737
01:09:39,253 --> 01:09:42,205
Hermione. What are you doing?
And what happened to you?

738
01:09:42,381 --> 01:09:47,670
I've just escaped.
I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.

739
01:09:47,845 --> 01:09:50,879
Cormac? That's who you invited?

740
01:09:51,056 --> 01:09:53,545
I thought it would annoy Ron the most.

741
01:09:54,393 --> 01:09:56,384
Thank you. I'll catch up with you later.

742
01:09:56,561 --> 01:09:59,559
He's got more tentacles
than a Snarfalump plant.

743
01:09:59,731 --> 01:10:01,888
- Dragon tartare?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

744
01:10:02,067 --> 01:10:04,734
Just as well.
They give one horribly bad breath.

745
01:10:04,902 --> 01:10:06,727
On second thoughts...

746
01:10:06,904 --> 01:10:08,895
Might keep Cormac at bay.

747
01:10:09,241 --> 01:10:12,156
Oh, God, here he comes.

748
01:10:14,705 --> 01:10:17,573
I think she just went to powder her nose.

749
01:10:17,749 --> 01:10:19,823
Slippery little minx, your friend.

750
01:10:20,001 --> 01:10:22,704
Likes to work her mouth too,
doesn't she?

751
01:10:25,757 --> 01:10:27,748
What is this I'm eating, by the way?

752
01:10:28,927 --> 01:10:30,549
Dragon balls.

753
01:10:41,772 --> 01:10:44,889
You've just bought yourself
a month's detention, McLaggen.

754
01:10:45,067 --> 01:10:48,932
Not so quick, Potter.

755
01:10:50,488 --> 01:10:53,605
Sir, I really think I should
rejoin the party. My date...

756
01:10:53,784 --> 01:10:57,696
Can surely survive your absence
for another minute or two.

757
01:10:57,872 --> 01:11:00,112
Besides, I only wish
to convey a message.

758
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:02,990
- A message?
- From Professor Dumbledore.

759
01:11:03,169 --> 01:11:06,832
He asked me to give you his best,
and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.

760
01:11:07,005 --> 01:11:08,545
You see...

761
01:11:08,715 --> 01:11:14,253
...he's traveling, and he won't
return until term resumes.

762
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:15,970
Traveling where?

763
01:11:24,106 --> 01:11:25,978
Take your hands off me, you filthy Squib!

764
01:11:27,108 --> 01:11:28,814
Professor Slughorn, sir.

765
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:33,311
I just discovered this boy
lurking in an upstairs corridor.

766
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:35,527
He claims to have been
invited to your party.

767
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,983
Okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?

768
01:11:39,162 --> 01:11:42,992
I'll escort him out.

769
01:11:45,793 --> 01:11:49,456
Certainly, professor.

770
01:11:53,092 --> 01:11:56,340
All right, everyone, carry on, carry on.

771
01:11:58,431 --> 01:12:03,340
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.
Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?

772
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:05,593
I swore to protect you.

773
01:12:05,771 --> 01:12:09,102
I made the Unbreakable Vow.

774
01:12:09,274 --> 01:12:11,431
I don't need protection.

775
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:15,771
I was chosen for this.
Out of all others. Me.

776
01:12:16,698 --> 01:12:20,231
- And I won't fail him.
- You're afraid, Draco.

777
01:12:20,828 --> 01:12:24,740
You attempt to conceal it,
but it's obvious. Let me assist you.

778
01:12:24,915 --> 01:12:26,371
No!

779
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:30,123
I was chosen. This is my moment.

780
01:12:42,557 --> 01:12:44,132
"Unbreakable Vow."

781
01:12:44,308 --> 01:12:45,930
You're sure that's what Snape said?

782
01:12:46,102 --> 01:12:48,389
Positive. Why?

783
01:12:48,563 --> 01:12:52,061
Well, it's just you can't break
an Unbreakable Vow.

784
01:12:52,233 --> 01:12:55,564
I'd worked that much out for myself,
funnily enough.

785
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:57,812
You don't understand.

786
01:12:58,447 --> 01:12:59,476
Oh, bloody hell.

787
01:13:27,309 --> 01:13:29,264
I miss you.

788
01:13:30,979 --> 01:13:32,519
Lovely.

789
01:13:32,689 --> 01:13:35,972
All she wants to do is snog me.
My lips are getting chapped. Look.

790
01:13:36,151 --> 01:13:38,355
I'll take your word for it.

791
01:13:48,456 --> 01:13:53,411
So, what happens to you? What happens
if you break an Unbreakable Vow?

792
01:13:53,961 --> 01:13:55,667
You die.

793
01:14:00,259 --> 01:14:02,131
Wait, the pudding's still here.

794
01:14:03,387 --> 01:14:06,718
Voldemort has chosen
Draco Malfoy for a mission?

795
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:07,967
I know it sounds mad.

796
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:11,638
Has it occurred to you Snape was
simply pretending to offer Draco help...

797
01:14:11,811 --> 01:14:14,300
...so he could find out
what he was up to?

798
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,478
- That's not what it sounded like.
- Perhaps Harry's right.

799
01:14:18,025 --> 01:14:19,647
To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's...

800
01:14:19,818 --> 01:14:23,316
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgment.

801
01:14:23,489 --> 01:14:27,567
- Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.
- Dumbledore can make mistakes.

802
01:14:27,744 --> 01:14:28,904
You're blinded by hatred.

803
01:14:29,078 --> 01:14:31,116
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

804
01:14:32,874 --> 01:14:35,872
People are disappearing, Harry, daily.

805
01:14:36,043 --> 01:14:37,998
We place our trust
in a handful of people.

806
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:41,122
If we start fighting amongst ourselves,
we're doomed.

807
01:15:05,614 --> 01:15:07,154
Open up, you.

808
01:15:08,826 --> 01:15:10,448
Don't you trust me?

809
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:17,785
It's good.

810
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:21,543
Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah.

811
01:15:28,302 --> 01:15:31,087
- Pie?
- Not for me, no.

812
01:15:43,025 --> 01:15:44,565
You'll have to forgive Remus.

813
01:15:44,818 --> 01:15:47,651
It takes its toll, his condition.

814
01:15:48,572 --> 01:15:50,610
Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?

815
01:15:50,783 --> 01:15:53,319
We're being followed, all of us.

816
01:15:53,494 --> 01:15:55,983
Most days,
Molly doesn't leave the house.

817
01:15:56,831 --> 01:15:58,905
It's not been easy.

818
01:16:00,918 --> 01:16:02,326
Did you get my owl?

819
01:16:02,503 --> 01:16:04,577
Yes, I did.

820
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:09,124
If Dumbledore's traveling,
then that's news to the Ministry...

821
01:16:09,301 --> 01:16:11,755
...but perhaps that's the way
Dumbledore wants it.

822
01:16:12,471 --> 01:16:14,960
As for Draco Malfoy...

823
01:16:15,598 --> 01:16:16,758
...I know a bit more.

824
01:16:17,392 --> 01:16:20,426
- Go on.
- I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.

825
01:16:20,603 --> 01:16:22,926
I think, from what you described...

826
01:16:23,106 --> 01:16:24,763
...what you and Ron saw in summer...

827
01:16:24,941 --> 01:16:28,439
...the object
that Draco is so interested in...

828
01:16:28,611 --> 01:16:30,103
...is a vanishing cabinet.

829
01:16:30,989 --> 01:16:32,267
A vanishing cabinet?

830
01:16:32,448 --> 01:16:36,444
They were all the rage
when Voldemort first rose to power.

831
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:39,572
You can see the appeal.
Should Death Eaters come knocking...

832
01:16:39,748 --> 01:16:44,491
...one simply had to slip inside
and disappear for an hour or two.

833
01:16:45,128 --> 01:16:46,870
They can transport you anywhere.

834
01:16:47,046 --> 01:16:50,413
Tricky contraptions though,
very temperamental.

835
01:16:50,591 --> 01:16:53,506
What happened to it?
The one at Borgin and Burkes?

836
01:16:53,678 --> 01:16:54,790
Nothing.

837
01:16:55,638 --> 01:16:57,344
It's still there.

838
01:17:08,442 --> 01:17:10,148
It was delicious, Molly, really.

839
01:17:10,318 --> 01:17:11,644
Are you sure you won't stay?

840
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:16,195
No, we should go. The first night
of the cycle's always the worst.

841
01:17:16,366 --> 01:17:17,395
Remus?

842
01:17:26,335 --> 01:17:27,875
Sweetheart.

843
01:17:36,177 --> 01:17:37,919
Has Ron gone to bed?

844
01:17:38,096 --> 01:17:40,929
Um... Not yet. No.

845
01:17:42,725 --> 01:17:44,051
Shoelace.

846
01:17:56,656 --> 01:17:58,528
Merry Christmas, Harry.

847
01:17:59,951 --> 01:18:01,491
Merry Christmas.

848
01:18:18,761 --> 01:18:21,048
- Harry, no!
- Remus!

849
01:18:30,897 --> 01:18:32,305
Ginny!

850
01:18:35,485 --> 01:18:40,144
<i>I killed Sirius Black!
I killed Sirius Black!</i>

851
01:18:40,323 --> 01:18:42,563
You coming to get me?

852
01:18:43,661 --> 01:18:46,992
Harry, can you get me?
You coming to get me?

853
01:19:16,733 --> 01:19:18,106
Harry?

854
01:19:35,628 --> 01:19:37,285
<i>Stupefy!</i>

855
01:20:00,152 --> 01:20:01,894
Harry!

856
01:20:15,418 --> 01:20:16,614
Ginny!

857
01:20:46,197 --> 01:20:47,689
Molly.

858
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:12,385
It's easy for them to get to you.

859
01:21:12,557 --> 01:21:16,683
You're bloody lucky you weren't killed.
You have to realize who you are, Harry.

860
01:21:16,852 --> 01:21:19,388
I know who I am, Hermione, all right?

861
01:21:20,356 --> 01:21:21,552
Sorry.

862
01:21:23,234 --> 01:21:26,565
Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.

863
01:21:26,737 --> 01:21:28,894
That's my Won-Won.

864
01:21:30,908 --> 01:21:33,314
Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.

865
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:53,257
<i>I'd like to know
where you get your information.</i>

866
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:56,464
<i>More knowledgeable
than half the staff, you are.</i>

867
01:22:02,104 --> 01:22:03,644
Sir...

868
01:22:04,106 --> 01:22:06,939
...is it true
that Professor Merrythought is retiring?

869
01:22:07,109 --> 01:22:09,894
Now, Tom.
I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?

870
01:22:10,153 --> 01:22:14,314
By the way, thank you for the pineapple.
You're quite right, it is my favorite.

871
01:22:14,908 --> 01:22:17,195
But how did you know?

872
01:22:19,038 --> 01:22:20,613
Intuition.

873
01:22:24,794 --> 01:22:26,500
Gracious. Is it that time already?

874
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:30,333
Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet
will have us all in detention.

875
01:22:34,469 --> 01:22:38,299
Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught
out of bed after hours.

876
01:22:40,225 --> 01:22:42,299
- Is something on your mind, Tom?
- Yes, sir.

877
01:22:43,645 --> 01:22:46,478
You see, I couldn't think
of anyone else to go to.

878
01:22:47,398 --> 01:22:52,390
The other professors,
well, they're not like you.

879
01:22:52,778 --> 01:22:55,812
They might misunderstand.

880
01:22:55,989 --> 01:22:57,564
Go on.

881
01:22:58,367 --> 01:23:00,654
I was in the library the other night...

882
01:23:01,204 --> 01:23:03,408
...in the Restricted Section...

883
01:23:04,165 --> 01:23:07,698
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

884
01:23:08,628 --> 01:23:12,126
And I thought perhaps
you could illuminate me.

885
01:23:12,298 --> 01:23:15,083
It's called, as I understand it...

886
01:23:18,011 --> 01:23:19,171
I beg your pardon?

887
01:23:19,346 --> 01:23:22,927
I don't know anything about such things,
and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!

888
01:23:23,099 --> 01:23:27,889
Now, get out of here at once, and don't
let me ever catch you mentioning it again!

889
01:23:30,857 --> 01:23:32,017
Confused?

890
01:23:32,692 --> 01:23:34,184
I'd be surprised if you weren't.

891
01:23:35,112 --> 01:23:37,861
Well, I don't understand.
What happened?

892
01:23:38,030 --> 01:23:41,693
This is perhaps the most important
memory I've collected.

893
01:23:42,035 --> 01:23:43,777
It is also a lie.

894
01:23:44,705 --> 01:23:46,495
This memory has been tampered with...

895
01:23:46,666 --> 01:23:51,041
...by the same person whose memory it is,
our old friend, Professor Slughorn.

896
01:23:51,670 --> 01:23:53,661
But why would he tamper
with his own memory?

897
01:23:53,839 --> 01:23:56,707
- I suspect he's ashamed of it.
- Why?

898
01:23:56,884 --> 01:23:58,376
Why, indeed?

899
01:23:59,177 --> 01:24:02,544
I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.

900
01:24:02,722 --> 01:24:06,338
Now I want you to persuade him
to divulge his true memory...

901
01:24:06,517 --> 01:24:08,057
...any way you can.

902
01:24:08,227 --> 01:24:10,182
I don't know him that well, sir.

903
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:17,565
This memory is everything.

904
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:20,061
Without it, we are blind.

905
01:24:20,573 --> 01:24:24,189
Without it, we leave the fate
of our world to chance.

906
01:24:26,244 --> 01:24:28,069
You have no choice.

907
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:31,281
You must not fail.

908
01:24:39,383 --> 01:24:41,706
So I'd highly recommend
you reacquaint yourself...

909
01:24:41,885 --> 01:24:43,341
...with the chapter on antidotes.

910
01:24:43,512 --> 01:24:47,259
I'll tell you more about bezoars
in our next class. Right, off you go.

911
01:24:47,433 --> 01:24:49,922
Alys, don't forget your rat tail.

912
01:24:55,399 --> 01:24:59,181
Aha. If it isn't
the Prince of Potions himself.

913
01:24:59,361 --> 01:25:01,268
To what do I owe this pleasure?

914
01:25:02,447 --> 01:25:04,521
Sir, I wondered
if I might ask you something.

915
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:06,939
Ask away, dear boy, ask away.

916
01:25:07,118 --> 01:25:10,116
The other day I was in the library,
in the Restricted Section...

917
01:25:10,288 --> 01:25:13,951
...and I came across something rather odd
about a very rare piece of magic.

918
01:25:15,293 --> 01:25:17,960
Yes. And what was this
rare piece of magic?

919
01:25:18,129 --> 01:25:21,460
Well, I don't know.
I can't remember the name exactly.

920
01:25:21,633 --> 01:25:25,960
It got me wondering, are there some kinds
of magic you're not allowed to teach us?

921
01:25:27,972 --> 01:25:29,298
I'm Potions Master, Harry.

922
01:25:29,474 --> 01:25:32,307
I think your question'd
better be posed to Professor Snape.

923
01:25:32,477 --> 01:25:34,384
Yes. Um...

924
01:25:34,562 --> 01:25:37,051
He and I don't exactly
see eye to eye, sir.

925
01:25:37,231 --> 01:25:39,021
What I mean to say is...

926
01:25:39,858 --> 01:25:41,648
...well, he's not like you.

927
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,145
He might misunderstand.

928
01:25:45,447 --> 01:25:49,277
Yes. There can be no light
without the dark.

929
01:25:49,451 --> 01:25:53,494
And so it is with magic. Myself, I always
strive to live within the light.

930
01:25:54,123 --> 01:25:55,780
I suggest you do the same.

931
01:25:56,167 --> 01:25:59,165
Is that what you told Tom Riddle,
when he came asking questions?

932
01:26:06,135 --> 01:26:09,169
Dumbledore put you up to this,
didn't he?

933
01:26:11,181 --> 01:26:12,803
Didn't he?

934
01:26:20,189 --> 01:26:21,467
Yes?

935
01:26:21,858 --> 01:26:23,979
Oh, it's you, Potter.

936
01:26:24,151 --> 01:26:26,521
I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.

937
01:26:39,334 --> 01:26:43,116
It's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.

938
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:45,538
Divine.

939
01:26:46,216 --> 01:26:48,503
Had ourselves a little
late-night snack, did we?

940
01:26:49,636 --> 01:26:53,217
It was on your bed, the box.
I just thought I'd try one.

941
01:26:53,389 --> 01:26:56,887
- Or 20.
- I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.

942
01:26:57,059 --> 01:26:59,050
Honestly, I reckoned
she was annoying you.

943
01:26:59,227 --> 01:27:01,550
She could never annoy me.

944
01:27:03,357 --> 01:27:04,897
I think I love her.

945
01:27:08,487 --> 01:27:10,774
Well, brilliant.

946
01:27:14,618 --> 01:27:16,240
Do you think she knows I exist?

947
01:27:16,411 --> 01:27:18,900
I hope so. She's been snogging you
for three months.

948
01:27:19,081 --> 01:27:22,033
Snogging? Who are you talking about?

949
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,203
Who are you talking about?

950
01:27:24,962 --> 01:27:28,578
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.

951
01:27:28,757 --> 01:27:30,249
Okay, very funny.

952
01:27:33,387 --> 01:27:37,050
- What was that for?
- It's no joke! I'm in love with her!

953
01:27:37,223 --> 01:27:40,091
Fine, you're in love with her.
Have you ever actually met her?

954
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:44,012
No. Can you introduce me?

955
01:28:05,710 --> 01:28:10,453
Come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you
to Romilda Vane.

956
01:28:21,224 --> 01:28:24,923
I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you
if it weren't absolutely essential.

957
01:28:25,771 --> 01:28:27,179
Where's Romilda?

958
01:28:27,356 --> 01:28:29,311
What's the matter with Wenby?

959
01:28:29,816 --> 01:28:31,641
Very powerful love potion.

960
01:28:31,819 --> 01:28:34,189
Very well. Better bring him in.

961
01:28:34,362 --> 01:28:37,645
I'd have thought you could whip up
a remedy for this in no time, Harry.

962
01:28:37,824 --> 01:28:40,739
Well, I thought this called
for a more practiced hand, sir.

963
01:28:40,910 --> 01:28:43,992
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?

964
01:28:44,164 --> 01:28:45,821
Perhaps you're right.

965
01:28:50,337 --> 01:28:55,756
I'm sorry, by the way, professor,
about earlier today, our misunderstanding.

966
01:28:55,926 --> 01:29:00,301
Oh, not at all. All water
under the bridge, you know? Correct?

967
01:29:00,472 --> 01:29:03,387
I expect you're tired of it
after all these years.

968
01:29:03,558 --> 01:29:06,129
All the questions about Voldemort.

969
01:29:06,310 --> 01:29:08,135
Don't use that name.

970
01:29:15,861 --> 01:29:17,935
There you are, old boy. Bottoms up.

971
01:29:18,113 --> 01:29:21,230
- What's this?
- Tonic for the nerves.

972
01:29:35,756 --> 01:29:38,043
- What happened to me?
- Love potion.

973
01:29:38,217 --> 01:29:40,338
A bloody strong one at that.

974
01:29:40,928 --> 01:29:44,544
- I feel really bad.
- You need a pick-me-up.

975
01:29:44,723 --> 01:29:48,386
Got Butterbeer,
wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.

976
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:52,887
I had other intentions for this,
but I think, given the circumstances...

977
01:29:55,191 --> 01:29:56,897
Here we are, Potter.

978
01:29:57,069 --> 01:29:58,561
To life!

979
01:30:03,366 --> 01:30:04,395
Ron.

980
01:30:06,869 --> 01:30:10,319
Ron. Professor, do something.

981
01:30:11,416 --> 01:30:13,038
I don't understand.

982
01:30:29,434 --> 01:30:31,224
Come on, Ron, breathe.

983
01:30:53,457 --> 01:30:56,290
These girls, they're gonna kill me.

984
01:31:07,304 --> 01:31:10,671
Quick thinking on your part, Harry,
using a bezoar.

985
01:31:10,849 --> 01:31:13,219
You must be very proud
of your student, Horace.

986
01:31:13,393 --> 01:31:16,807
Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.

987
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:19,729
I think we agree,
Potter's actions were heroic.

988
01:31:19,899 --> 01:31:23,895
The question is,
why were they necessary?

989
01:31:24,069 --> 01:31:25,811
Why, indeed?

990
01:31:25,989 --> 01:31:27,980
This appears to be a gift, Horace.

991
01:31:28,324 --> 01:31:31,157
You don't remember
who gave you this bottle?

992
01:31:31,327 --> 01:31:35,275
Which, by the way, possesses remarkably
subtle hints of licorice and cherry...

993
01:31:35,456 --> 01:31:37,910
...when not polluted with poison.

994
01:31:38,085 --> 01:31:41,202
Actually I had intended
to give it as a gift myself.

995
01:31:41,379 --> 01:31:42,752
To whom, I might ask?

996
01:31:44,591 --> 01:31:46,748
To you, Headmaster.

997
01:31:49,094 --> 01:31:50,171
Where is he?

998
01:31:50,346 --> 01:31:54,472
Where's my Won-Won?
Has he been asking for me?

999
01:31:57,519 --> 01:31:59,176
What's she doing here?

1000
01:31:59,354 --> 01:32:01,594
I might ask you the same question.

1001
01:32:01,774 --> 01:32:04,014
I happen to be his girlfriend.

1002
01:32:04,192 --> 01:32:06,941
I happen to be his friend.

1003
01:32:07,112 --> 01:32:11,321
Don't make me laugh.
You haven't spoken in weeks.

1004
01:32:12,117 --> 01:32:14,985
I suppose you want to make up
now that he's all interesting.

1005
01:32:15,161 --> 01:32:18,860
He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!

1006
01:32:19,041 --> 01:32:21,874
And for the record,
I've always found him interesting.

1007
01:32:23,545 --> 01:32:28,585
Ah. See? He senses my presence.

1008
01:32:28,759 --> 01:32:32,042
Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.

1009
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,545
I'm here.

1010
01:32:40,395 --> 01:32:43,596
Uh... Hermione...

1011
01:32:47,651 --> 01:32:49,642
Hermione.

1012
01:32:50,404 --> 01:32:52,644
Hermione.

1013
01:33:00,247 --> 01:33:04,159
Oh, to be young,
and to feel love's keen sting.

1014
01:33:04,502 --> 01:33:06,825
Well, come away, everybody.

1015
01:33:07,005 --> 01:33:09,624
Mr. Weasley is well tended.

1016
01:33:13,886 --> 01:33:16,422
About time, don't you think?

1017
01:33:19,099 --> 01:33:20,674
Thank you.

1018
01:33:23,604 --> 01:33:25,429
Oh, shut up.

1019
01:35:37,736 --> 01:35:41,518
Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.

1020
01:35:45,994 --> 01:35:48,661
Tell me how I broke up
with Lavender again.

1021
01:35:49,497 --> 01:35:52,330
Um, well...

1022
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:55,498
...she came to visit you
in the hospital.

1023
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:58,786
And you talked.

1024
01:36:00,383 --> 01:36:04,461
I don't believe it was
a particularly long conversation.

1025
01:36:04,638 --> 01:36:07,921
Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled
to be shot of her.

1026
01:36:08,099 --> 01:36:10,422
It's just she seems a bit put out.

1027
01:36:16,941 --> 01:36:20,439
Yes, she does, doesn't she?

1028
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:27,110
You say you don't remember
anything from that night?

1029
01:36:27,284 --> 01:36:30,282
Anything at all?

1030
01:36:30,453 --> 01:36:32,278
There is something.

1031
01:36:35,792 --> 01:36:40,250
But it can't be.
I was completely boggled, wasn't I?

1032
01:36:41,757 --> 01:36:44,958
Right. Boggled.

1033
01:36:52,225 --> 01:36:53,468
Harry.

1034
01:36:54,936 --> 01:36:56,096
That's Katie.

1035
01:36:58,065 --> 01:36:59,687
Katie Bell.

1036
01:37:07,365 --> 01:37:09,735
Katie. How are you?

1037
01:37:10,409 --> 01:37:14,903
I know you're going to ask, Harry,
but I don't know who cursed me.

1038
01:37:16,541 --> 01:37:20,074
I've been trying to remember, honestly.

1039
01:37:20,503 --> 01:37:23,917
But I just can't.

1040
01:37:37,186 --> 01:37:38,512
Katie?

1041
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:25,057
I know what you did, Malfoy.
You hexed her, didn't you?

1042
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:57,421
<i>Sectumsempra!</i>

1043
01:39:44,394 --> 01:39:47,309
<i>Vulnera Sanentur.</i>

1044
01:39:48,982 --> 01:39:51,815
<i>Vulnera Sanentur.</i>

1045
01:39:54,112 --> 01:39:56,980
<i>Vulnera Sanentur.</i>

1046
01:40:18,093 --> 01:40:21,626
You have to get rid of it. Today.

1047
01:40:26,518 --> 01:40:28,140
Take my hand.

1048
01:40:44,119 --> 01:40:46,026
The Room of Requirement.

1049
01:40:52,502 --> 01:40:55,121
We need to hide
the Half-Blood Prince's book...

1050
01:40:55,296 --> 01:40:58,995
...where no one will ever find it,
including you.

1051
01:41:07,349 --> 01:41:08,805
- What was that?
- What was that?

1052
01:41:34,918 --> 01:41:36,244
See?

1053
01:41:36,796 --> 01:41:38,834
You never know what you'll find up here.

1054
01:41:57,983 --> 01:42:01,895
All right, close your eyes.
That way you can't be tempted.

1055
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:07,446
Close your eyes.

1056
01:42:34,142 --> 01:42:37,010
That can stay hidden up here too,
if you like.

1057
01:42:51,659 --> 01:42:54,029
So did you and Ginny do it, then?

1058
01:42:54,203 --> 01:42:55,363
What?

1059
01:42:55,537 --> 01:42:57,611
You know, hide the book?

1060
01:42:57,789 --> 01:42:59,661
Oh, yeah.

1061
01:43:02,587 --> 01:43:05,158
Ah. Dear, yes.

1062
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:08,125
Still no luck with Slughorn, then,
I take it?

1063
01:43:10,178 --> 01:43:11,504
Luck.

1064
01:43:12,555 --> 01:43:15,886
That's it. All I need's a bit of luck.

1065
01:43:34,034 --> 01:43:37,235
Well, how do you feel?

1066
01:43:37,412 --> 01:43:39,034
Excellent.

1067
01:43:40,206 --> 01:43:42,197
Really excellent.

1068
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:46,535
Remember...

1069
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,622
...Slughorn usually eats early...

1070
01:43:48,799 --> 01:43:51,797
...takes a walk,
and then returns to his office.

1071
01:43:51,969 --> 01:43:53,461
Right.

1072
01:43:53,887 --> 01:43:56,044
- I'm going down to Hagrid's.
- What?

1073
01:43:56,222 --> 01:43:58,889
No, Harry, you've got to go
and speak to Slughorn.

1074
01:44:00,477 --> 01:44:03,048
- We have a plan.
- I know...

1075
01:44:03,229 --> 01:44:05,303
...but I've got a
good feeling about Hagrid's.

1076
01:44:05,481 --> 01:44:09,228
I feel it's the place to be tonight.
Do you know what I mean?

1077
01:44:10,110 --> 01:44:12,350
- No.
- Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.

1078
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:14,687
Or Felix does.

1079
01:44:47,939 --> 01:44:49,645
Merlin's beard, Harry!

1080
01:44:49,816 --> 01:44:53,942
Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself.
Cleared my throat, coughed.

1081
01:44:54,112 --> 01:44:56,067
You probably feared
I was Professor Sprout.

1082
01:44:56,239 --> 01:44:59,653
Yes, I did, actually.
What makes you think that?

1083
01:44:59,826 --> 01:45:01,900
Well, just the general behavior, sir.

1084
01:45:02,077 --> 01:45:04,862
The sneaking around,
the jumping when you saw me.

1085
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:08,620
Are those Tentacula leaves, sir?
They're very valuable, aren't they?

1086
01:45:08,792 --> 01:45:11,115
Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.

1087
01:45:11,296 --> 01:45:14,794
Not that I'm familiar with any such
transactions, but one does hear rumors.

1088
01:45:14,966 --> 01:45:18,748
My own interests
are purely academic, of course.

1089
01:45:18,929 --> 01:45:22,212
Personally, these plants
always kind of freaked me out.

1090
01:45:25,476 --> 01:45:27,633
How did you get out of the castle, Harry?

1091
01:45:27,812 --> 01:45:29,304
Through the front door, sir.

1092
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:31,637
I'm off to Hagrid's.
He's a very dear friend...

1093
01:45:31,815 --> 01:45:33,521
...and I fancied paying him a visit.

1094
01:45:33,692 --> 01:45:35,979
So if you don't mind,
I will be going now.

1095
01:45:36,778 --> 01:45:38,400
Harry!

1096
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:41,694
- Sir?
- It's nearly nightfall.

1097
01:45:41,867 --> 01:45:45,317
Surely you realize I can't allow you
to go roaming the grounds by yourself.

1098
01:45:45,495 --> 01:45:48,066
Well, then, by all means, come along, sir.

1099
01:45:53,419 --> 01:45:56,620
Harry, I must insist
you accompany me...

1100
01:45:56,799 --> 01:45:58,541
...back to the castle immediately!

1101
01:45:58,717 --> 01:46:01,965
That would be counterproductive, sir.

1102
01:46:03,305 --> 01:46:05,426
And what makes you say that?

1103
01:46:06,516 --> 01:46:08,091
No idea.

1104
01:46:14,858 --> 01:46:16,266
Horace.

1105
01:46:16,901 --> 01:46:22,190
Merlin's beard.
Is that an actual Acromantula?

1106
01:46:22,782 --> 01:46:24,856
A dead one, I think, sir.

1107
01:46:25,659 --> 01:46:27,199
Good God.

1108
01:46:27,829 --> 01:46:30,911
Dear fellow,
however did you manage to kill it?

1109
01:46:31,207 --> 01:46:34,657
Kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.

1110
01:46:34,835 --> 01:46:39,044
- I'm so sorry, I didn't...
- Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.

1111
01:46:39,549 --> 01:46:42,999
Seriously misunderstood creatures,
spiders are.

1112
01:46:43,178 --> 01:46:45,382
It's the eyes, I reckon.
They unnerve some folk.

1113
01:46:45,804 --> 01:46:47,759
Not to mention the pincers.

1114
01:46:52,061 --> 01:46:54,016
Yeah, I reckon that too.

1115
01:46:54,730 --> 01:46:58,097
Hagrid, the last thing
I wish to be is indelicate...

1116
01:46:58,275 --> 01:47:02,353
...but Acromantular venom
is uncommonly rare.

1117
01:47:02,529 --> 01:47:04,733
Would you allow me
to extract a vial or two?

1118
01:47:04,907 --> 01:47:07,526
Purely for academic purposes,
you understand.

1119
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:10,615
Well, I don't suppose it's going
to do him much good now, is it?

1120
01:47:10,787 --> 01:47:11,983
My thoughts exactly.

1121
01:47:12,163 --> 01:47:18,662
Always have a ampoule or two about
my person for just such occasions as this.

1122
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:23,912
Old Potions Master's habit, you know.

1123
01:47:24,593 --> 01:47:27,047
I wish you could've seen him
in his prime.

1124
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:30,883
Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.

1125
01:47:32,308 --> 01:47:33,883
Oh, dear.

1126
01:47:43,611 --> 01:47:46,812
- Would you like me to say a few words?
- Yes.

1127
01:47:47,073 --> 01:47:48,613
He had a family, I trust?

1128
01:47:48,783 --> 01:47:50,275
Oh, yeah.

1129
01:47:55,622 --> 01:47:57,114
Farewell...

1130
01:47:57,291 --> 01:47:59,163
Aragog.

1131
01:48:03,673 --> 01:48:06,588
Farewell, Aragog...

1132
01:48:06,968 --> 01:48:09,635
...king of the arachnids.

1133
01:48:10,471 --> 01:48:13,042
Your body will decay...

1134
01:48:14,308 --> 01:48:17,141
...but your spirit lingers on.

1135
01:48:17,853 --> 01:48:24,469
And your human friends find solace
in the loss they have sustained.

1136
01:48:39,665 --> 01:48:43,281
I had him from an egg, you know.
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

1137
01:48:43,461 --> 01:48:47,160
No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.

1138
01:48:47,341 --> 01:48:52,500
How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis.
He was very dear to me.

1139
01:48:52,679 --> 01:48:57,838
One afternoon I came downstairs,
and he'd vanished.

1140
01:48:58,017 --> 01:48:59,592
Poof.

1141
01:48:59,769 --> 01:49:02,970
- That's very odd, isn't it?
- It is, isn't it?

1142
01:49:03,147 --> 01:49:06,846
But that's life, I suppose.

1143
01:49:07,026 --> 01:49:12,363
You go along and then suddenly, poof!

1144
01:49:12,531 --> 01:49:16,194
- Poof.
- Poof.

1145
01:49:30,758 --> 01:49:33,875
It was a student who gave me Francis.

1146
01:49:34,887 --> 01:49:39,179
One spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk...

1147
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:43,052
...with just a few inches
of clear water in it.

1148
01:49:43,854 --> 01:49:47,387
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.

1149
01:49:48,942 --> 01:49:51,396
As I watched, it sank.

1150
01:49:52,904 --> 01:49:55,737
Just before it reached the bottom...

1151
01:49:55,907 --> 01:49:57,363
...it transformed...

1152
01:49:58,742 --> 01:50:00,567
...into a wee fish.

1153
01:50:02,247 --> 01:50:04,368
It was beautiful magic.

1154
01:50:05,374 --> 01:50:07,614
Wondrous to behold.

1155
01:50:10,254 --> 01:50:13,003
The flower petal had come from a lily.

1156
01:50:15,384 --> 01:50:16,413
Your mother.

1157
01:50:18,471 --> 01:50:20,960
The day I came downstairs...

1158
01:50:21,932 --> 01:50:24,219
...the day the bowl was empty...

1159
01:50:25,770 --> 01:50:27,927
...was the day your mother...

1160
01:50:31,942 --> 01:50:33,933
I know why you're here.

1161
01:50:36,947 --> 01:50:38,938
But I can't help you.

1162
01:50:40,743 --> 01:50:42,449
It would ruin me.

1163
01:50:46,164 --> 01:50:48,618
Do you know why I survived, professor?

1164
01:50:49,168 --> 01:50:50,993
The night I got this?

1165
01:50:52,754 --> 01:50:54,376
Because of her.

1166
01:50:55,299 --> 01:50:57,089
Because she sacrificed herself.

1167
01:50:57,510 --> 01:50:59,880
Because she refused to step aside.

1168
01:51:00,053 --> 01:51:03,254
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.

1169
01:51:03,432 --> 01:51:07,131
- Don't say his name.
- I'm not afraid of the name, professor.

1170
01:51:07,978 --> 01:51:10,099
I'm going to tell you something.

1171
01:51:11,023 --> 01:51:13,975
Something others have only guessed at.

1172
01:51:15,944 --> 01:51:17,436
It's true.

1173
01:51:18,029 --> 01:51:19,307
I am the Chosen One.

1174
01:51:20,323 --> 01:51:22,527
Only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so...

1175
01:51:22,702 --> 01:51:25,985
...I need to know what Tom Riddle
asked you years ago in your office...

1176
01:51:26,163 --> 01:51:28,533
...and I need to know what you told him.

1177
01:51:29,249 --> 01:51:31,655
Be brave, professor.

1178
01:51:33,295 --> 01:51:35,369
Be brave like my mother.

1179
01:51:36,673 --> 01:51:39,340
Otherwise, you disgrace her.

1180
01:51:40,469 --> 01:51:42,756
Otherwise, she died for nothing.

1181
01:51:43,764 --> 01:51:48,969
Otherwise, the bowl
will remain empty forever.

1182
01:51:59,529 --> 01:52:02,646
Please, don't think badly of me
when you see it.

1183
01:52:04,659 --> 01:52:07,942
You've no idea what he was like,
even then.

1184
01:52:44,697 --> 01:52:47,400
I was in the library the other night...

1185
01:52:47,576 --> 01:52:49,733
...in the Restricted Section...

1186
01:52:50,620 --> 01:52:54,236
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

1187
01:52:55,542 --> 01:52:58,291
It's called, as I understand it...

1188
01:52:59,587 --> 01:53:00,913
...a Horcrux.

1189
01:53:02,757 --> 01:53:05,506
- I beg your pardon?
- Horcrux.

1190
01:53:05,927 --> 01:53:08,594
I came across the term while reading...

1191
01:53:08,764 --> 01:53:11,762
...and I didn't fully understand it.

1192
01:53:11,934 --> 01:53:13,676
I'm not sure what you
were reading, Tom...

1193
01:53:13,852 --> 01:53:16,423
...but this is very dark stuff,
very dark indeed.

1194
01:53:16,605 --> 01:53:18,145
Which is...

1195
01:53:19,274 --> 01:53:21,099
...why I came to you.

1196
01:53:23,945 --> 01:53:29,566
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

1197
01:53:29,742 --> 01:53:32,361
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

1198
01:53:34,955 --> 01:53:38,951
One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

1199
01:53:39,126 --> 01:53:42,742
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1200
01:53:42,921 --> 01:53:44,033
Protected?

1201
01:53:44,214 --> 01:53:47,415
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

1202
01:53:48,886 --> 01:53:51,292
In other words, you cannot die.

1203
01:53:58,479 --> 01:54:01,643
And how does one split his soul, sir?

1204
01:54:01,815 --> 01:54:04,600
I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.

1205
01:54:05,819 --> 01:54:07,311
Murder.

1206
01:54:07,821 --> 01:54:09,147
Yes.

1207
01:54:09,698 --> 01:54:14,607
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

1208
01:54:15,495 --> 01:54:20,238
Can you only split the soul
once? For instance, isn't seven...?

1209
01:54:20,417 --> 01:54:21,909
Seven?

1210
01:54:22,669 --> 01:54:27,958
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

1211
01:54:28,132 --> 01:54:31,879
To rip the soul into seven pieces...

1212
01:54:33,054 --> 01:54:36,088
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All academic?

1213
01:54:40,854 --> 01:54:42,180
Of course, sir.

1214
01:54:45,149 --> 01:54:47,140
It'll be our little secret.

1215
01:54:55,951 --> 01:54:57,194
Sir.

1216
01:55:12,593 --> 01:55:14,714
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1217
01:55:14,887 --> 01:55:17,554
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?

1218
01:55:17,723 --> 01:55:20,840
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

1219
01:55:21,018 --> 01:55:22,047
What are they exactly?

1220
01:55:22,227 --> 01:55:25,558
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

1221
01:55:28,733 --> 01:55:30,439
A ring, for example.

1222
01:55:31,069 --> 01:55:32,561
Or a book.

1223
01:55:33,863 --> 01:55:36,233
- Tom Riddle's diary.
- It's a Horcrux, yes.

1224
01:55:36,741 --> 01:55:38,862
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

1225
01:55:39,035 --> 01:55:41,322
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1226
01:55:41,496 --> 01:55:43,403
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1227
01:55:43,581 --> 01:55:48,573
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

1228
01:55:48,752 --> 01:55:50,743
- The ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1229
01:55:51,130 --> 01:55:55,873
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1230
01:55:56,053 --> 01:55:59,918
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux...

1231
01:56:00,098 --> 01:56:01,258
One destroys Voldemort.

1232
01:56:01,433 --> 01:56:04,348
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.

1233
01:56:04,519 --> 01:56:07,767
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1234
01:56:21,743 --> 01:56:23,615
...leaves traces.

1235
01:56:31,420 --> 01:56:33,494
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?

1236
01:56:33,671 --> 01:56:35,958
- When you leave the school?
- Yes.

1237
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:39,882
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

1238
01:56:40,054 --> 01:56:44,132
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1239
01:56:45,684 --> 01:56:50,343
Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1240
01:56:54,317 --> 01:56:56,604
Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

1241
01:56:56,778 --> 01:56:59,397
...that you take too much for granted?

1242
01:56:59,573 --> 01:57:04,613
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?

1243
01:57:04,786 --> 01:57:06,907
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1244
01:57:07,788 --> 01:57:13,575
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1245
01:57:31,979 --> 01:57:33,601
Oh, Harry.

1246
01:57:36,191 --> 01:57:38,514
You need a shave, my friend.

1247
01:57:41,321 --> 01:57:45,530
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1248
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:49,648
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

1249
01:57:51,205 --> 01:57:53,575
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1250
01:57:54,042 --> 01:57:55,534
I'm an old man.

1251
01:57:55,710 --> 01:57:57,367
You still look the same to me, sir.

1252
01:57:58,838 --> 01:58:01,836
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

1253
01:58:02,008 --> 01:58:05,209
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

1254
01:58:07,972 --> 01:58:12,466
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1255
01:58:12,644 --> 01:58:16,142
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

1256
01:58:16,314 --> 01:58:18,139
But there is one condition:

1257
01:58:18,316 --> 01:58:21,517
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

1258
01:58:22,403 --> 01:58:24,025
Yes, sir.

1259
01:58:24,197 --> 01:58:26,318
You do understand what I'm saying?

1260
01:58:26,908 --> 01:58:29,397
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1261
01:58:29,577 --> 01:58:31,900
Should I tell you to run, you run.

1262
01:58:32,079 --> 01:58:36,075
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

1263
01:58:41,254 --> 01:58:42,829
Your word, Harry.

1264
01:58:44,466 --> 01:58:45,958
My word.

1265
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:48,417
Take my arm.

1266
01:58:49,847 --> 01:58:52,253
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

1267
01:58:52,933 --> 01:58:56,383
Well, being me has its privileges.

1268
01:59:43,649 --> 01:59:45,271
This is the place.

1269
01:59:46,069 --> 01:59:47,644
Oh, yes.

1270
01:59:48,570 --> 01:59:51,141
This place has known magic.

1271
01:59:59,165 --> 02:00:00,705
- Sir!
- In order to gain passage...

1272
02:00:00,874 --> 02:00:02,282
...payment must be made.

1273
02:00:02,459 --> 02:00:06,075
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1274
02:00:07,673 --> 02:00:09,498
- You should've let me, sir.
- No, Harry.

1275
02:00:09,966 --> 02:00:12,669
Your blood's much more precious
than mine.

1276
02:00:34,574 --> 02:00:39,198
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1277
02:00:39,371 --> 02:00:42,702
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

1278
02:00:45,292 --> 02:00:46,700
Careful.

1279
02:01:10,234 --> 02:01:11,346
There it is.

1280
02:01:12,862 --> 02:01:15,565
The only question is,
how do we get there?

1281
02:01:37,762 --> 02:01:39,587
If you would, Harry.

1282
02:02:26,893 --> 02:02:29,299
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?

1283
02:02:29,937 --> 02:02:31,310
Oh, yes.

1284
02:02:42,406 --> 02:02:43,981
It has to be drunk.

1285
02:02:44,158 --> 02:02:46,991
All of it has to be drunk.

1286
02:02:47,828 --> 02:02:51,159
You remember the conditions on which
I brought you with me?

1287
02:02:51,331 --> 02:02:53,737
This potion might paralyze me.

1288
02:02:54,167 --> 02:02:55,824
Might make me forget why I'm here.

1289
02:02:56,629 --> 02:02:59,912
Might cause me so much pain
that I beg for relief.

1290
02:03:00,174 --> 02:03:02,081
You are not to indulge these requests.

1291
02:03:02,259 --> 02:03:05,792
It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.

1292
02:03:05,971 --> 02:03:08,425
Even if you have to force it
down my throat.

1293
02:03:08,891 --> 02:03:11,012
- Understood?
- Why can't I drink it, sir?

1294
02:03:11,185 --> 02:03:16,604
Because I am much older, much cleverer,
and much less valuable.

1295
02:03:20,527 --> 02:03:22,601
Your good health, Harry.

1296
02:03:38,753 --> 02:03:40,031
Professor.

1297
02:03:42,173 --> 02:03:43,369
Professor!

1298
02:03:50,056 --> 02:03:51,548
Harry.

1299
02:03:51,724 --> 02:03:54,213
Professor, can you hear me?

1300
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:56,680
Professor.

1301
02:04:12,119 --> 02:04:13,231
No. Don't.

1302
02:04:13,411 --> 02:04:15,734
You have to keep drinking,
like you said. Remember?

1303
02:04:25,006 --> 02:04:26,878
- Stop.
- It will stop. It will stop...

1304
02:04:27,050 --> 02:04:31,460
...but only if you keep drinking.
- Please, don't make me.

1305
02:04:31,638 --> 02:04:33,759
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Please.

1306
02:04:33,933 --> 02:04:36,220
- Kill me. Kill me!
- No!

1307
02:04:38,145 --> 02:04:39,222
It's my fault.

1308
02:04:40,898 --> 02:04:42,094
It's all my fault.

1309
02:04:43,942 --> 02:04:45,564
It's my fault.

1310
02:04:45,736 --> 02:04:49,103
Just one more, sir.
One more, and then I promise...

1311
02:04:49,781 --> 02:04:52,104
...I promise I'll do what you say.

1312
02:04:52,284 --> 02:04:54,109
- I promise.
- No.

1313
02:04:55,161 --> 02:04:56,534
Please.

1314
02:05:20,687 --> 02:05:22,143
Harry.

1315
02:05:29,278 --> 02:05:30,307
Water.

1316
02:05:31,322 --> 02:05:32,434
Water.

1317
02:05:32,615 --> 02:05:34,405
Water.

1318
02:05:40,914 --> 02:05:42,704
You did it, sir.

1319
02:05:42,874 --> 02:05:44,330
Look.

1320
02:05:46,336 --> 02:05:47,579
Harry.

1321
02:05:48,963 --> 02:05:50,289
Water.

1322
02:05:52,049 --> 02:05:53,706
<i>Aguamenti.</i>

1323
02:05:53,926 --> 02:05:55,382
Water.

1324
02:06:31,547 --> 02:06:32,920
<i>Lumos.</i>

1325
02:07:01,368 --> 02:07:03,275
<i>Lumos Maxima!</i>

1326
02:07:12,753 --> 02:07:14,578
Harry.

1327
02:07:18,635 --> 02:07:19,747
<i>Sectumsempra!</i>

1328
02:07:19,929 --> 02:07:21,089
Harry.

1329
02:07:22,056 --> 02:07:23,678
<i>- Stupefy!
- Harry.</i>

1330
02:08:22,865 --> 02:08:24,143
Harry.

1331
02:08:28,162 --> 02:08:30,485
<i>Partis Temporus!</i>

1332
02:09:13,039 --> 02:09:16,156
Go to your houses. No dawdling.

1333
02:09:56,998 --> 02:10:00,697
We need to get you to the hospital
wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.

1334
02:10:03,130 --> 02:10:04,503
No.

1335
02:10:05,548 --> 02:10:08,215
Severus. Severus is who I need.

1336
02:10:08,384 --> 02:10:11,917
Wake him. Tell him what happened.

1337
02:10:12,096 --> 02:10:13,753
Speak to no one else.

1338
02:10:14,392 --> 02:10:16,596
Severus, Harry.

1339
02:10:21,898 --> 02:10:24,304
Hide yourself below, Harry.

1340
02:10:25,778 --> 02:10:28,776
Don't speak or be seen by anybody
without my permission.

1341
02:10:28,946 --> 02:10:32,728
Whatever happens,
it's imperative you stay below.

1342
02:10:33,534 --> 02:10:35,191
Harry, do as I say.

1343
02:10:38,831 --> 02:10:40,109
Trust me.

1344
02:10:41,876 --> 02:10:43,332
Trust me.

1345
02:11:03,898 --> 02:11:05,723
Good evening, Draco.

1346
02:11:06,609 --> 02:11:10,142
What brings you here
on this fine spring evening?

1347
02:11:10,321 --> 02:11:12,063
Who else is here? I heard you talking.

1348
02:11:12,239 --> 02:11:16,317
I often talk aloud to
myself. I find it extraordinarily useful.

1349
02:11:18,453 --> 02:11:21,286
Have you been whispering
to yourself, Draco?

1350
02:11:23,792 --> 02:11:25,248
Draco...

1351
02:11:25,918 --> 02:11:28,870
...you are no assassin.
- How do you know what I am?

1352
02:11:29,047 --> 02:11:30,837
I've done things that would shock you.

1353
02:11:31,007 --> 02:11:35,133
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in
return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?

1354
02:11:35,303 --> 02:11:37,922
Replacing a bottle of mead
with one laced with poison?

1355
02:11:38,098 --> 02:11:39,673
Forgive me, Draco.

1356
02:11:39,850 --> 02:11:42,339
I cannot help feeling these actions
are so weak...

1357
02:11:42,519 --> 02:11:44,889
...your heart can't really
have been in them.

1358
02:11:45,063 --> 02:11:48,264
He trusts me. I was chosen.

1359
02:11:52,070 --> 02:11:53,860
Then I shall make it easy for you.

1360
02:11:54,030 --> 02:11:55,687
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1361
02:11:59,035 --> 02:12:01,358
Very good. Very good.

1362
02:12:03,122 --> 02:12:04,578
You're not alone.

1363
02:12:05,666 --> 02:12:06,695
There are others.

1364
02:12:08,752 --> 02:12:10,160
How?

1365
02:12:11,464 --> 02:12:14,131
The vanishing cabinet
in the Room of Requirement.

1366
02:12:14,884 --> 02:12:17,254
- I've been mending it.
- Let me guess.

1367
02:12:17,427 --> 02:12:20,379
It has a sister. A twin.

1368
02:12:20,555 --> 02:12:22,759
In Borgin and Burkes.
They form a passage.

1369
02:12:22,933 --> 02:12:24,723
Ingenious.

1370
02:12:25,394 --> 02:12:26,637
Draco...

1371
02:12:26,813 --> 02:12:32,896
...years ago, I knew a boy
who made all the wrong choices.

1372
02:12:33,819 --> 02:12:36,734
- Please let me help you.
- I don't want your help!

1373
02:12:37,531 --> 02:12:41,029
Don't you understand? I have to do this.

1374
02:12:42,244 --> 02:12:43,901
I have to kill you.

1375
02:12:44,537 --> 02:12:46,575
Or he's gonna kill me.

1376
02:12:56,090 --> 02:12:59,706
Well, look what we have here.

1377
02:13:01,596 --> 02:13:03,753
Well done, Draco.

1378
02:13:07,435 --> 02:13:09,260
Good evening, Bellatrix.

1379
02:13:10,313 --> 02:13:12,470
I think introductions
are in order, don't you?

1380
02:13:12,649 --> 02:13:17,772
Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid
we're all on a bit of a tight schedule.

1381
02:13:18,405 --> 02:13:19,778
Do it.

1382
02:13:21,073 --> 02:13:25,199
He doesn't have the stomach,
just like his father.

1383
02:13:25,620 --> 02:13:27,112
Let me finish him in my own way.

1384
02:13:27,288 --> 02:13:30,904
No! The Dark Lord was clear,
the boy is to do it.

1385
02:13:31,083 --> 02:13:33,121
This is your moment. Do it.

1386
02:13:34,670 --> 02:13:36,661
Go on, Draco.

1387
02:13:36,839 --> 02:13:38,996
Now!

1388
02:13:40,259 --> 02:13:41,585
No.

1389
02:13:53,480 --> 02:13:55,020
Severus.

1390
02:14:04,032 --> 02:14:05,488
Please.

1391
02:14:06,493 --> 02:14:07,819
<i>Avada Kedavra.</i>

1392
02:15:12,223 --> 02:15:15,673
Hagrid! Hello?

1393
02:15:15,853 --> 02:15:19,896
Snape! He trusted you!

1394
02:15:24,236 --> 02:15:25,858
Go on.

1395
02:15:26,530 --> 02:15:28,236
<i>Incarcerous.</i>

1396
02:15:28,406 --> 02:15:31,073
Fight back! You coward, fight back!

1397
02:15:32,702 --> 02:15:35,903
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord.

1398
02:15:56,059 --> 02:15:57,432
<i>Sectumsempra!</i>

1399
02:16:05,901 --> 02:16:11,142
You dare use my own spells
against me, Potter?

1400
02:16:11,907 --> 02:16:13,067
Yes.

1401
02:16:13,784 --> 02:16:17,945
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.

1402
02:20:06,011 --> 02:20:07,467
McGONAGALL:
Potter...

1403
02:20:08,179 --> 02:20:10,668
...in light of what has happened...

1404
02:20:12,099 --> 02:20:15,382
...if you should have the need
to talk to someone...

1405
02:20:17,355 --> 02:20:21,351
You should know,
Professor Dumbledore...

1406
02:20:23,195 --> 02:20:25,649
...you meant a great deal to him.

1407
02:20:43,922 --> 02:20:46,079
Do you think he would've done it?

1408
02:20:46,259 --> 02:20:48,131
Draco?

1409
02:20:49,220 --> 02:20:50,546
No.

1410
02:20:51,722 --> 02:20:53,760
No, he was lowering his wand.

1411
02:20:54,808 --> 02:20:56,763
In the end, it was Snape.

1412
02:20:57,395 --> 02:20:59,849
It was always Snape.

1413
02:21:00,022 --> 02:21:02,226
And I did nothing.

1414
02:21:08,906 --> 02:21:10,314
It's fake.

1415
02:21:11,909 --> 02:21:13,235
Open it.

1416
02:21:24,253 --> 02:21:28,249
"To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead
long before you read this...

1417
02:21:28,425 --> 02:21:32,088
...but I want you to know that it was I
who discovered your secret.

1418
02:21:33,096 --> 02:21:36,961
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend
to destroy it as soon as I can.

1419
02:21:37,141 --> 02:21:40,175
I face death in the hope that
when you meet your match...

1420
02:21:40,354 --> 02:21:42,594
...you will be mortal once more.

1421
02:21:43,899 --> 02:21:45,556
R.A.B."

1422
02:21:46,818 --> 02:21:48,274
R.A.B.

1423
02:21:48,653 --> 02:21:49,931
Don't know.

1424
02:21:51,948 --> 02:21:54,615
But whoever they are,
they have the real Horcrux.

1425
02:21:55,576 --> 02:21:57,116
Which means it was all a waste.

1426
02:21:58,454 --> 02:21:59,946
All of it.

1427
02:22:06,169 --> 02:22:08,243
Ron's okay with it, you know.

1428
02:22:08,756 --> 02:22:10,248
You and Ginny.

1429
02:22:10,882 --> 02:22:14,581
But if I were you, when he's around,
I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.

1430
02:22:15,929 --> 02:22:17,920
I'm not coming back, Hermione.

1431
02:22:19,099 --> 02:22:21,802
I've got to finish
whatever Dumbledore started.

1432
02:22:21,977 --> 02:22:24,810
And I don't know where that'll lead me...

1433
02:22:24,981 --> 02:22:28,597
...but I'll let you and Ron know
where I am when I can.

1434
02:22:29,944 --> 02:22:32,563
I've always admired your courage, Harry.

1435
02:22:32,738 --> 02:22:35,405
But sometimes, you can be really thick.

1436
02:22:38,452 --> 02:22:40,692
You don't really think
you're going to be able...

1437
02:22:40,871 --> 02:22:43,241
...to find all those Horcruxes
by yourself, do you?

1438
02:22:47,502 --> 02:22:49,159
You need us, Harry.

1439
02:23:04,979 --> 02:23:08,061
I never realized
how beautiful this place was.
