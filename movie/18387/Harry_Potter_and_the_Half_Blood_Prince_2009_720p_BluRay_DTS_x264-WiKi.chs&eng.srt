我杀了小天狼星布莱克！
I killed Sirius Black!

4
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:31,654
他回来了
He's back.

00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:58,379
警方仍在进一步调查…
The police are continuing with the investigation...

7
00:02:58,552 --> 00:03:00,592
千禧桥坍塌事件
... into the cause of the Millennium Bridge disaster.

8
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:04,463
警方搜寻幸存者期间，交通一度暂停 【塌方事故死亡人数增加/哈利・波特：救世主？】
Traffic has been halted as police search for survivors.

9
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:06,301
事故现场周边区域仍处于戒备状态
The surrounding area remains closed.

10
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,643

11
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,231
“哈利・波特”
"Harry Potter."

12
00:03:16,653 --> 00:03:18,397
哈利・波特是谁？
Who's Harry Potter?

13
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:21,941
哦，谁也不是
Oh, no one.

14
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,868
可能是某个呆子吧 （Tosser另有某龌龊词义，有意者自查）
Bit of a tosser, really.

15
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,032
你的报纸怪怪的
Funny, that paper of yours.

16
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,828
前几天晚上，我敢发誓看到照片里的人动了
Couple nights ago, I could've sworn I saw a picture move.

17
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:33,788
- 真的？ - 我估计是干活累得看花眼了
- Really? - Thought I was going around the twist.

18
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:45,095
- 嘿，我在想… - 11点，我那会下班
- Hey, I was wondering... - Eleven. That's when I get off.

19
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:48,053
到时候你可以跟我 慢慢讲讲这个呆瓜哈利・波特
You can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter.

20
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:41,186
你这个夏天可是大胆得很啊，哈利
You've been reckless this summer, Harry.

21
00:04:41,363 --> 00:04:43,652
我喜欢坐坐地铁
I like riding around on trains.

22
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:46,817
免得胡思乱想
Takes my mind off things.

23
00:04:48,328 --> 00:04:50,238
看着不怎么招人喜欢，对吧？
Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?

24
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:53,747
说实话，这倒是个挺惊险的故事
The tale is thrilling, if I say so myself.

25
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:56,455
可现在不是说故事的时候
But now is not the time to tell it.

26
00:04:56,628 --> 00:04:58,206
搭着我的手臂
Take my arm.

27
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:03,127
照我说的做
Do as I say.

28
00:05:12,227 --> 00:05:13,722
我刚刚是不是幻影移形了？
I just Apparated, didn't I?

29
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:17,062
是的，要我说，还很是成功
Indeed. Quite successfully too, I might add.

30
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:19,854
绝大多数人第一次都吐了
Most people vomit the first time.

31
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:21,770
真让人想不通（反话）
I can't imagine why.

32
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:33,243
欢迎来到美丽的巴德莱・巴伯顿村
Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton.

33
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:37,709
哈利，我猜，现在你正奇怪 我为什么要带你来这里
Harry, I assume, right about now, you're wondering why I brought you here.

34
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:39,586
对吧？
Am I right?

35
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:43,124
老实说，教授，经历这么多年 我差不多已经不想了
Actually, sir, after all these years, I just sort of go with it.

36
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:49,513
拔出魔杖，哈利
Wands out, Harry.

37
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,402
霍拉斯？
Horace?

38
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,950
霍拉斯？
Horace?

39
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,504
梅林的胡子啊！ （意为我的老天爷！哈迷都知道吧）
Merlin's beard!

40
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:12,968
你也没必要非得戳穿我啊，阿不思
No need to disfigure me, Albus.

41
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,841
我不得不说，你这椅子变得很是成功，霍拉斯
Well, I must say you make a very convincing armchair, Horace.

42
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:22,182
那都是表面功夫做的足，里子那是天然的（大肚子） 我哪儿露馅了？
It's all in the upholstery. I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?

43
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,019
龙血
Dragon's blood.

44
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:28,564
- 哦 - 哦，对了，我给你们介绍
- Oh. - Oh, yes, introductions.

45
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:32,737
哈利，来来见见 我的这位老朋友，老同事…
Harry, I'd like you to meet an old friend and colleague of mine...

46
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,368
霍拉斯・斯拉格霍恩
...Horace Slughorn.

47
00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:36,031
霍拉斯…
Horace...

48
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,992
我知道他是谁
...well, you know who this is.

49
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,867
哈利・波特
Harry Potter.

50
00:07:44,713 --> 00:07:46,457
你这房间布置得如此有舞台效果 怎么回事，霍拉斯？
What's with all the theatrics, Horace?

51
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,087
你不会还在等别的客人吧？
You weren't, by any chance, waiting for someone else?

52
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,715
客人？我可不知道你什么意思
Someone else? I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

53
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:55,630
好了，食死徒想招纳我，都一年多了
All right, the Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year.

54
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,136
你知道那是什么样的日子吗？
Do you know what that's like?

55
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:01,058
我不能拒绝太多次 所以在任何一个地方我都呆不过一周
You can only say no so many times, so I never stay anywhere more than a week.

56
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:03,561
这家的麻瓜主人去加那利群岛度假了
Muggles who own this are in the Canary Islands.

57
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:08,608
我想，我们最好还是把这里收拾一下 不介意吧？
Well, I think we should put it back in order for them, don't you? Mind.

58
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,105
真是有趣
That was fun.

59
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,109
- 介意我用下洗手间吗？ - 当然不介意
- Do you mind if I use the loo? - No, of course.

60
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,115
别以为我不知道你为什么来，阿不思
Don't think I don't know why you're here, Albus.

61
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:58,786
答案还是“不” 确定以及肯定的不
The answer's still no. Absolutely and unequivocally, no.

62
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,247
你长得很像你父亲
You're very like your father.

63
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:13,253
- 除了这双眼睛，很像… - 我母亲的眼睛，我知道
- Except for the eyes. You have your... - My mother's eyes. Yeah.

64
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:17,128
莉莉，伶俐的莉莉，你的母亲很聪慧
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was exceedingly bright, your mother.

65
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,639
要是再考虑到她还是个麻瓜出生 就更是了不起了
Even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born.

66
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:23,383
我一个最好的朋友也是麻瓜出生 是全年级最棒的
One of my best friends is Muggle-born. Best in our year.

67
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:25,602
请不要以为我有偏见，没有，绝对没有
Please don't think I'm prejudiced. No, no.

68
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:29,984
你母亲绝对是我最喜欢的学生之一 看，她就在那儿
Your mother was one of my absolute favorites. Look, there she is.

69
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,943
前排
Right at the front.

70
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,408
全是我的，所有人
All mine. Each and every one.

71
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,658
全是我以前的学生
Ex-students, I mean.

72
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:52,297
你认出巴拿巴斯・古费了吧 他是预言家日报的主编
You recognize Barnabas Cuffe, editor of The Daily Prophet.

73
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,666
要是对当天的新闻有什么看法 我就可以派猫头鹰
Always takes my owl, should I wish to register an opinion...

74
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:57,125
给他捎个信
...on the news of the day.

75
00:09:58,013 --> 00:10:00,967
格韦诺格・琼斯 霍利黑德哈比队队长
Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holyhead Harpies.

76
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:03,597
只要我想，随时都能拿到免费门票
Free tickets whenever I want them.

77
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:06,770
自然了，我已经很久没有看比赛了
Of course, I haven't been to a match in some time.

78
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,024
哦，对了
Ah, yes.

79
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,350
雷古勒斯・布莱克
Regulus Black.

80
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:16,477
你肯定认识他的哥哥 小天狼星，前几周刚刚过世
You no doubt know of his older brother Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.

81
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,195
布莱克全家都是我教的 除了小天狼星
I taught the whole Black family, except Sirius.

82
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,574
真是可惜，他是个很有天赋的孩子
It's a shame. Talented boy.

83
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:27,036
雷古勒斯一来，我就看好他了 当然，如果兄弟一起，就更完美了
I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I'd have liked the set.

84
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,116
霍拉斯？
Horace?

85
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,379
不介意我带走这个吧？
Do you mind if I take this?

86
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:39,591
- 我很喜欢这些针织的款式 - 当然，拿去吧，可你不会现在就走吧？
- I do love knitting patterns. - Yes, of course. But you're not leaving?

87
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:42,883
事情已成定局时，我还是知道的 真是太可惜了
I think I know a lost cause when I see one. Regrettable.

88
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:45,347
如果能劝你同我一起回霍格沃兹…
I would have considered it a personal triumph...

89
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,473
我自然将不胜荣幸
...had you consented to return to Hogwarts. Oh, well.

90
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:51,648
你跟波特一样，可都是可遇不可求啊
You're like my friend Mr. Potter here, one of a kind.

91
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,984
好了，再会，霍拉斯
Well, bye-bye, Horace.

92
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,309
再见
Bye.

93
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:09,834
好吧，我答应
All right. I'll do it.

94
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:14,580
我要原来梅乐思教授的办公室 我原来的那个像厕所
But I want Professor Merrythought's old office, not the water closet I had before.

95
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:18,968
我还要加薪！这年头疯事不少！ （难道是因为古灵阁也闹银行危机？）
And I expect a raise. These are mad times we live in. Mad!

96
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,387
确实不少
They are indeed.

97
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:27,683
教授，刚才到底是怎么回事？
Sir, exactly what was all that about?

98
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:32,932
你有天赋，有名气，有力量 有霍拉斯重视的一切
You are talented, famous and powerful. Everything Horace values.

99
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:36,524
斯拉格霍恩教授 会想将你收入门下，哈利
Professor Slughorn is gonna try to collect you, Harry.

100
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,067
你会是他所有门徒中最闪耀的 （直译：你将成为他的冠冕明珠）
You would be his crowning jewel.

101
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:44,779
因为你，所以他才回霍格沃兹 对我们来说，他回来也很重要
That's why he's returning to Hogwarts. And it's crucial he should return.

102
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,615
恐怕我已经搅了 你这个原本美妙的夜晚，哈利
I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry.

103
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:53,832
那位姑娘，说真的，可真是漂亮
She was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl.

104
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:57,456
没事，教授，我明天回去 找点借口跟她解释就好了
It's all right, sir. I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse.

105
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:01,298
你今晚可回不了小惠金区，哈利
Oh, you'll not be returning to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.

106
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,471
可是，海德薇怎么办？还有我的行李？
But, sir, what about Hedwig? And my trunk?

107
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,309
都等着你呢
Both are waiting for you.

108
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,343
海德薇
Hedwig.

109
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,175
妈？
Mum?

110
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,933
金妮，什么事？
Ginny, what is it?

111
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,593
哈利什么时候来的？
I was only wondering when Harry got here.

112
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,020
- 什么？哈利？哪个哈利？ - 当然是哈利・波特了
- What? Harry? Harry who? - Harry Potter, of course.

113
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,357
哈利・波特要是在我家，我会不知道吗？
I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?

114
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:02,026
- 他的行李就放在厨房呢，还有猫头鹰 - 不会吧，亲爱的，我可不信
- His trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl. - No, dear, I seriously doubt that.

115
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,318
哈利？有谁说“哈利”了？
Harry? Did someone say "Harry"?

116
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:08,450
我说的，多事鬼，他在楼上吗？
Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?

117
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,657
当然没，我死党要是在我屋，我会不知道？
Of course not. I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I?

118
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,323
- 是猫头鹰在叫吗？ - 你没见到他，对吧？
- Is that an owl? - You haven't seen him, have you?

119
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:16,245
他貌似在这屋里游荡呢
He's wandering about the house.

120
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,163
- 真的？ - 真的
- Really? - Really.

121
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,000
哈利！
Harry!

122
00:13:26,221 --> 00:13:27,929
哈利！
Harry!

123
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,136
真是个惊喜
What a lovely surprise.

124
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,556
你怎么不先跟我们说一声？
Why didn't you let us know you were coming?

125
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,568
- 我不知道要来，是邓不利多 - 哦，他啊
- I didn't know. Dumbledore. - Oh, that man.

126
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,978
他就是爱乱来 可要是没了他，我们可怎么办
But then, what would we do without him?

127
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:46,909
你嘴角有点牙膏 （列位看官，注意此处伏笔）
Got a bit of toothpaste.

128
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,535
你什么时候到的？
So when did you get here?

129
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,417
没几天
A few days ago.

130
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,662
不过在那之前，我犹豫了一阵子
Though for a while, I wasn't sure I was coming.

131
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,755
老妈上星期有点神经过敏
Mum sort of lost it last week.

132
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,887
说我和金妮回霍格沃兹也没用
Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts.

133
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,430
说那里很危险
That it's too dangerous.

134
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,433
- 拜托 - 不止她一个
- Oh, come on. - She's not alone.

135
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,935
就连我爸妈，他们即使是麻瓜 也知道发生了不好的事情
Even my parents, and they're Muggles, know something bad's happening.

136
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,972
不管怎样吧，老爸插话了 说老妈是一时糊涂
Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy...

137
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:22,683
劝了是有几天 不过最后她总算回心转意
...and it took a few days, but she came around.

138
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,944
我们说的可是霍格沃兹 是邓不利多，还有哪里更安全？
But this is Hogwarts we're talking about. It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?

139
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,820
最近有很多风言风语…
There's been a lot of talk recently that...

140
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,287
说邓不利多老了
...Dumbledore's got a bit old.

141
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,248
胡说，他才…
Rubbish! Well, he's only...

142
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,994
他得多大了？
What is he?

143
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,372
一百五十岁？差不离了吧
Hundred and fifty? Give or take a few years.

144
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:05,274
西茜！你不能这么做！ 不能相信他！
Cissy! You can't do this! He can't be trusted!

145
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,904
黑魔王信任他
The Dark Lord trusts him.

146
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,655
黑魔王被蒙蔽了
- The Dark Lord's mistaken. - Pfft.

147
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:42,180
退下吧，虫尾巴
Run along, Wormtail.

148
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,690
我知道，我不该来这
I know I ought not to be here.

149
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,574
黑魔王陛下禁止我谈论此事
The Dark Lord himself forbade me to speak of this.

150
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,411
如果黑魔王不准你谈，你就不该谈
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak.

151
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:58,825
放下，贝拉，别人的东西，不要乱动
Put it down, Bella. We mustn't touch what isn't ours.

152
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:06,662
巧的是，我知道你现在的处境，纳西莎
As it so happens, I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.

153
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,003
你？
You?

154
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,381
黑魔王把这件事告诉了你？
The Dark Lord told you?

155
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,508
你妹妹质疑我
Your sister doubts me.

156
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,393
可以理解，这么多年，我演的太好了
Understandable. Over the years I've played my part well.

157
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,309
好得骗倒了有史以来最伟大的巫师之一
So well, I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time.

158
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:27,647
邓不利多是一名伟大的巫师 只有蠢材才会怀疑
Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it.

159
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,729
我不怀疑你，西弗勒斯
I don't doubt you, Severus.

160
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:33,072
你该感到荣耀，西茜，德拉科也是
You should be honored, Cissy. As should Draco.

161
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,370
他还只是个孩子
He's just a boy.

162
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,250
我无法动摇黑魔王的意志
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.

163
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:48,544
但我可以暗中帮助德拉科
But it might be possible for me to help Draco.

164
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,218
- 西弗勒斯 - 发誓
- Severus. - Swear to it.

165
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,715
立一个牢不可破的誓言
Make the Unbreakable Vow.

166
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,642
其他的都是空话
It's just empty words.

167
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:10,020
什么“我会尽力”了
He'll give it his best effort.

168
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,568
可到了真正关键的时候…
But when it matters most...

169
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:18,411
他就只会滑回自己的蛇洞
...he'll just slither back into his hole.

170
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,498
懦夫
Coward.

171
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:30,128
拿出魔仗
Take out your wand.

172
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,474
你…
Will you...

173
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,686
西弗勒斯・斯内普…
...Severus Snape...

174
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,775
能否看顾德拉科・马尔福…
...watch over Draco Malfoy...

175
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:54,771
助他完成黑魔王的嘱托？
...as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes?

176
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,817
我会
I will.

177
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,868
你，能否尽你所能…
And will you, to the best of your ability...

178
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,747
保护他，免受伤害？
...protect him from harm?

179
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,491
我会
I will.

180
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,080
如果德拉科失败…
And if Draco should fail...

181
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:18,844
你，能否继续完成…
...will you yourself carry out the deed...

182
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:24,009
黑魔王所托未竟之事？
...the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?

183
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,769
我会
I will.

184
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,550
瞧一瞧，看一看了，新到的昏迷花糖！
Step up! Step up! We've got Fainting Fancies!

185
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,750
鼻血牛扎糖！
Nosebleed Nougats!

186
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:01,012
- 若想准时下课… - 就用呕吐片！
- And just in time for school... - Puking Pastilles!

187
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,054
吐到坩埚里哦，小帅哥
- Into the cauldron, handsome. - Into the cauldron, handsome.

188
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,908
- 隐身烟雾弹，秘鲁进口的 - 这可是我们的摇钱树
- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder. - A real money spinner, that.

189
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,200
脱身必备哦
Handy if you need to make a quick getaway.

190
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,115
好了，女士们
- Hello, ladies. - Hello, ladies.

191
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,575
- 想试试迷魂药？ - 效果确实不错哦
- Love potions, eh? - Yeah, they really do work.

192
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:33,085
不过话说回来，据我们掌握的情报 小妹，你自己就很玩得转嘛
Then again, the way we hear it, sis, you're doing just fine on your own.

193
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,418
什么意思？
Meaning?

194
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,713
你不是在和迪安・托马斯好着吗？
Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?

195
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,919
不关你们的事
It's none of your business.

196
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,714
这个多少钱？
How much for this?

197
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,268
五加隆
- Five Galleons. - Five Galleons.

198
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,559
- 卖给我多少钱？ - 五加隆
- How much for me? - Five Galleons.

199
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,928
我是你们弟弟
I'm your brother.

200
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,354
那就十加隆
- Ten Galleons. - Ten Galleons.

201
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,937
好了，我们走吧
Come on, let's go.

202
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,817
嗨，罗恩
Hi, Ron.

203
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,134
乔治和弗雷德怎么办到的？ 半条对角巷的店都关了
How are Fred and George doing it? Half the Alley's closed down.

204
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,876
弗雷德觉得，在这种时候 大家更需要点笑声
Fred reckons people need a laugh these days.

205
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,304
我觉得他说的对
I reckon he's right.

206
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,678
不会吧
Oh, no.

207
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,470
大家的魔杖都是从奥利凡德买的
Everyone got their wands from Ollivander's.

208
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,326
哈利？
Harry?

209
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,238
我是看花眼，还是那真是德拉科和他老妈…
Is it me, or do Draco and Mummy look like two people...

210
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,123
鬼鬼祟祟不想被人看见？
...who don't want to be followed?

211
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,683
唱唱反调
Quibbler.

212
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,025
唱唱反调
Quibbler.

213
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:47,607
这个侏儒蒲真可爱，他们会在节礼日唱歌，你知道的吧 （节礼日：圣诞节后第一个周日）
He's lovely. They've been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know.

214
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,155
- 来份唱唱反调？ - 哦，谢谢
- Quibbler? - Oh, please.

215
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,908
- 搔扰虻是什么？ - 那是一种隐形生物
- What's a Wrackspurt? - They're invisible creatures.

216
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,248
他们会钻进你耳朵，搞得你脑子一团糟
They float in your ears and make your brain go fuzzy.

217
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,335
唱唱反调
Quibbler.

218
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,557
你们说，德拉科要那个诡异的橱柜干嘛？
So, what was Draco doing with that weird-looking cabinet?

219
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,433
还有那群人，都谁啊？
And who were all those people?

220
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,721
你看不出来吗？ 那是某种仪式，入会仪式
Don't you see? It was a ceremony, an initiation.

221
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,806
别说了，哈利，我知道你想说什么
Stop it, Harry. I know where you're going.

222
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,473
事实摆在眼前，他是他们的一份子
It's happened. He's one of them.

223
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,145
谁们？
One of what?

224
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,355
哈利觉得，德拉科・马尔福是食死徒
Harry is under the impression Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

225
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,489
少扯了
You're barking.

226
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,782
神秘人要他能干什么？
What would You-Know-Who want with Malfoy?

227
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:36,998
那你们说，他在博金―博克干嘛？挑家具？
Well, then what's he doing in Borgin and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?

228
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,039
怪人逛怪店，见怪不怪
It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.

229
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:43,077
他爸是食死徒，他也是，这才说得通
Look, his father is a Death Eater. It only makes sense.

230
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,833
赫敏也亲眼看到了
Hermione saw it with her own eyes.

231
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:48,340
我说过了，我不知道那是什么
I told you, I don't know what I saw.

232
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,596
我得去透透气
I need some air.

233
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:12,106
别担心，等到了霍格沃兹，我们再收拾
Don't worry. When we get to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out.

234
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:35,763
- 怎么回事？布雷斯 - 不知道
- What was that? Blaise? - Don't know.

235
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:39,053
别紧张兮兮的 可能只是一些一年级小鬼在瞎闹
Relax, boys. It's probably just a first-year messing around.

236
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:42,597
来了，德拉科，坐下 马上就到霍格沃兹了
Come on, Draco. Sit down. We'll be at Hogwarts soon.

237
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:56,066
霍格沃兹 找这么个借口去上学，真可悲
Hogwarts. What a pathetic excuse for a school.

238
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,237
要是我还得在那上两年学
I'd pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower...

239
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,537
我非得跳天文塔自杀不可
...if I had to continue for another two years.

240
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,036
你这话什么意思啊？
What's that supposed to mean?

241
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:07,125
这么说吧，明年 你就看不到我在魔咒课上浪费生命了
Let's just say you won't see me wasting my time in Charms class next year.

242
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,751
很好笑吗，布雷斯？
Amused, Blaise?

243
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,627
那就看是谁笑到最后
We'll see just who's laughing in the end.

244
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:40,534
你们两个先走 我还要检查下一点东西
You two go on. I wanna check something.

245
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:43,988
哈利在哪？
Where's Harry?

246
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:47,122
他可能已经上站台了，走吧
He's probably already on the platform. Come on.

247
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:06,311
难道你妈咪没告诉你 偷听很没礼貌吗，波特？
Didn't Mummy ever tell you it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?

248
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,059
统统石化！
Petrificus Totalus.

249
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:24,449
你还没学会擦干口水，她就死了
...she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin.

250
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:33,130
这一脚是替我父亲踢的 回伦敦旅行愉快
That's for my father. Enjoy your ride back to London.

251
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,712
咒立停
Finite.

252
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:26,132
- 你好啊，哈利 - 卢娜！
- Hello, Harry. - Luna!

253
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,229
- 你怎么知道我在这？ - 骚扰虻，你满脑子都是
- How'd you know where I was? - Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.

254
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:40,617
真不好意思，害你也错过马车，卢娜
Sorry I made you miss the carriages, by the way, Luna.

255
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,951
没关系，感觉像是跟朋友散步
That's all right. It was like being with a friend.

256
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,160
我就是你朋友，卢娜
Oh, I am your friend, Luna.

257
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,373
真好
That's nice.

258
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,745
刚好，我找你们两个半天了
About time. I've been looking all over for you two.

259
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,756
好了，姓名？
Right. Names?

260
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,379
弗利维教授，你都认识我五年了
Professor Flitwick, you've known me for five years.

261
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,674
谁也不能例外，波特
No exceptions, Potter.

262
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,964
他们是谁？
Who are those people?

263
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,428
傲罗，负责安全保卫的
Aurors. For security.

264
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,059
这根藤条是干什么的？
What's this cane here, then?

265
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,593
这不是藤条，你个蠢货，是手杖
It's not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick.

266
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:12,768
那你准备拿这个干什么？
And what exactly would you be wanting with a...?

267
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,027
这可以拿来当武器使
Could be construed as an offensive weapon.

268
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:22,438
没事了，费尔奇，我能替马尔福担保
It's all right, Mr. Filch. I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.

269
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,790
这一脸够帅啊，波特
Nice face, Potter.

270
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,667
你希望我帮你治好吗？
Would you like me to fix it for you?

271
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,628
我个人觉得，你这样看着更不修边幅…
Personally, I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way...

272
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:46,349
不过治不治由你
...but it's up to you.

273
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:49,056
那个，你以前治过鼻子吗？
Well, have you ever fixed a nose before?

274
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:52,928
没，脚趾头倒是治过一些 能差得到哪里去呢，对吧？
No, but I've done several toes, and how different are they, really?

275
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,897
嗯，好吧，那就试试
Um... Okay, yeah. Give it a go.

276
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,362
愈合如初
- Episkey. - Ah!

277
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:11,664
- 看起来怎么样？ - 异常得正常
- How do I look? - Exceptionally ordinary.

278
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,168
好极了
Brilliant.

279
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:23,591
别担心，他一会就到了
Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.

280
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,179
你能不能别吃了？
Will you stop eating?

281
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,594
你最好的朋友不见了！
Your best friend is missing!

282
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,021
诶，回头看，小疯子
Oi. Turn around, you lunatic.

283
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,313
他又满身是血
He's covered in blood again.

284
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:44,730
- 他怎么老是浑身是血？ - 好像这回是他自己的血
- Why is it he's always covered in blood? - Looks like it's his own this time.

285
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,074
你去哪儿了？
Where have you been?

286
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,700
- 你的脸怎么了？ - 呆会再说
- What happened to your face? - Later.

287
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,496
我错过什么了吗？
What've I missed?

288
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:55,825
分院帽鼓励大伙，在这种乱世 要变得更勇敢坚强
Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times.

289
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:59,538
它说得倒轻巧，是不？它不过是顶帽子
Easy for it to say, huh? It's a hat, isn't it?

290
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,097
各位晚上好
Very best of evenings to you all.

291
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,297
多谢
Thanks.

292
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:17,181
首先，我给大家介绍一下新教员
First off, let me introduce the newest member of our staff...

293
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:19,599
霍拉斯・斯拉格霍恩
...Horace Slughorn.

294
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,362
斯拉格霍恩教授，我在此荣幸地宣布…
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say...

295
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:29,826
已经同意回来继任魔药课教授
...has agreed to resume his old post as Potions Master.

296
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,913
与此同时，黑魔法防御课教授
Meanwhile, the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts...

297
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:34,873
将由斯内普教授担任
...will be taken by Professor Snape.

298
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,751
斯内普？
Snape?

299
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,424
如各位所知
Now, as you know...

300
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:48,258
每人在今晚入校前都被搜查
...each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival here tonight.

301
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,423
你们有权知道原因
And you have the right to know why.

302
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:54,807
从前，有个年轻人，他和你们一样
Once there was a young man, who, like you...

303
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,434
坐过这个大厅
...sat in this very hall...

304
00:30:57,815 --> 00:31:02,441
走过这里的走廊，睡过这里的床铺
...walked this castle's corridors, slept under its roof.

305
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:07,405
他看起来和其他人没什么两样
He seemed to all the world a student like any other.

306
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,117
他的名字？
His name?

307
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,906
叫汤姆・里德尔
Tom Riddle.

308
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,744
如今，当然了
Today, of course...

309
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,628
世人只知道他的另一个名字
...he's known all over the world by another name.

310
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:29,006
正因此，此时此刻，我看着诸位
Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight...

311
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,552
想起来一个不争的事实
...I'm reminded of a sobering fact.

312
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:35,844
每天，每时
Every day, every hour...

313
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,977
甚至于就在这一刻，或许
...this very minute, perhaps...

314
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:42,476
黑暗势力就在试图侵入这城堡的高墙
...dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle's walls.

315
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:49,651
但最终，他们最致命的武器，还是你们
But in the end, their greatest weapon is you.

316
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:54,826
希望你们能好好想想
Just something to think about.

317
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,659
好了，上床去吧，晚安
Now, off to bed. Pip-pip.

318
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:01,126
这可真叫鼓舞人心
That was cheerful.

319
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:11,170
女士们，魔法史在楼上上课，不是楼下
History of Magic is upstairs, ladies, not down.

320
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:16,967
戴维斯！戴维斯（先生）！那里是女厕所
Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies! That is the girls' lavatory.

321
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:21,182
波特
Potter.

322
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,482
哦，不妙
Oh, this can't be good.

323
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,155
最近过的不错，对吧？
Enjoying ourselves, are we?

324
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:33,277
- 我早上没课 - 我发现了
- I had a free period this morning. - So I noticed.

325
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:36,193
我想你大概会考虑去上魔药课
I would think you would want to fill it with Potions.

326
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:39,041
又或者你已经不再想当傲罗了？
Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror?

327
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:43,452
我是想，可我得先在O.W.L考试里拿“优秀” （OWL:十六岁时参加的普通巫师等级考试）
It was, but I was told I had to get an "Outstanding" in my O.W.L.

328
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,499
确实，斯内普教授教魔药的时候是如此
So you did, when Professor Snape was teaching Potions.

329
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:51,252
但是，斯拉格霍恩教授会很乐意收
However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. s students...

330
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,220
得“良好”（超过预期）的N.W.E.T.s学生 （NWET:七年级时要参加的终极巫师考试）
...with "Exceeds Expectations."

331
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,382
太好了，嗯…
Brilliant. Um...

332
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,013
- 那，我这就过去 - 很好，很好
- Well, I'll head there straightaway. - Oh, good, good.

333
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:03,096
波特，把韦斯莱也带上 他看起来太快活了
Potter, take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there.

334
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,181
我不想上魔药课
I don't wanna take Potions.

335
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,065
魁地奇球员选拔就要开始了 我还得多练练呢
This is Quidditch trials coming up. I need to practice.

336
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,279
在准备阶段关注细节…
Attention to detail in the preparation...

337
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,738
是所有计划成功的先觉条件
...is the prerequisite of all planning.

338
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:21,702
哈利，孩子，我都开始担心了 我看你还带了朋友过来嘛
Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry. We've brought someone with us, I see.

339
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,532
我叫罗恩・韦斯莱，教授
Ron Weasley, sir.

340
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,542
我魔药学得糟透了 说实话，要我煎药对别人也是威胁
But I'm dead awful at Potions, a menace, actually.

341
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:28,790
- 所以我… - 胡说，我们上完课才知道
- I'm gonna... - Nonsense, we'll sort you out.

342
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:32,050
哈利的朋友就是我的朋友 把书都拿出来
Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine. Get your books out.

343
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:34,757
我的书还没到，罗恩也没书
I haven't actually got my book yet, and nor has Ron.

344
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,638
那就去壁橱里找找吧
Get what you want from the cupboard.

345
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:40,141
刚才我们说到，今早 我准备了一些汤剂
Now, as I was saying, I prepared some concoctions this morning.

346
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:44,260
有谁知道这些都是什么吗？
Any ideas what these might be?

347
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:48,348
- 很好，这位…？ - 格兰杰，教授
- Yes, Miss...? - Granger, sir.

348
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:56,074
那锅是吐真剂，可以令人吐露真相
That one there is Veritaserum. It's a truth-telling serum.

349
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,948
那锅是复方汤剂
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

350
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,243
熬制起来相当复杂
It's terribly tricky to make.

351
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:06,457
这锅，是迷情剂
And this is Amortentia...

352
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,036
世上最强效的迷魂药
...the most powerful love potion in the world.

353
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:13,797
据说，它因人而异，会散发出 最吸引当事人的气味
It's rumored to smell differently to each person according to what attracts them.

354
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:17,088
比如，我闻到的是…
For example, I smell...

355
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:21,893
刚刚割过的草坪 崭新的羊皮纸，和…
...freshly mown grass, and new parchment, and...

356
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:25,394
留兰香味牙膏 （记得之前说的那个“伏笔”吗？）
...spearmint toothpaste.

357
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:30,267
迷情剂不能产生真正的爱情 因为爱情不可能仿造
Amortentia doesn't create actual love. That would be impossible.

358
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:35,439
但它确实可以令人产生迷恋
But it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession.

359
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:42,283
因此，这可能是这个房间里最危险的魔药
And for that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room.

360
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,623
教授，你还没说，那个锅里的是什么
Sir? You haven't told us what's in that one.

361
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,714
哦，对了
Oh, yes.

362
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:55,456
女士们先生们，你们所看到的
What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen...

363
00:34:55,636 --> 00:35:01,057
是一种神奇的药水，叫福灵剂
...is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis.

364
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:03,717
不过，人们通常都称之为…
But it is more commonly referred to as...

365
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:09,185
- 幸运水 - 正是，格兰杰小姐，幸运水
- Liquid luck. - Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.

366
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:12,692
制作过程极度繁复 稍有差错，后果便不堪设想
Desperately tricky to make, disastrous should you get it wrong.

367
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:18,482
只需一小口，你的所有努力 便能轻而易举地成功
One sip and you will find that all of your endeavors succeed.

368
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:23,027
至少，在药效过去之前是如此
At least until the effects wear off.

369
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:27,704
所以呢，今天我就拿它做奖品
So this is what I offer each of you today.

370
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:32,704
这一小瓶的幸运水，将奖励给…
One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student who, in the hour that remains...

371
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:37,460
能在一个小时内，熬制出生死水的学生 （生死水：强效安眠药）
...manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death...

372
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,886
所需的材料都罗列在书本的第十页
...the recipes for which can be found on page 10 of your books.

373
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:44,721
不过我要提醒大家，在此之前 只有一名学生
I should point out, however, only once did a student manage to brew a potion...

374
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:48,227
熬出了合格的生死水，赢得这个奖励
...of sufficient quality to claim this prize.

375
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:51,056
话虽如此，还是祝各位好运！
Nevertheless, good luck to you all.

376
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:53,733
现在就正式开始吧
Let the brewing commence.

377
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:00,543
【此书乃混血王子之财产】
this book is the property of the half blood prince

378
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:25,038
【切碎跳跳豆】 【用刀侧碾碎，更易出汁】
cut the sopophorus bean

379
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:31,390
你怎么办到的？
How did you do that?

380
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,099
你用碾的，别切
You crush it. Don't cut it.

381
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:36,767
不对，书上写的明明白白，要切
No. The instructions specifically say to cut.

382
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,772
不用，真的
No, really.

383
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:19,443
梅林的胡子啊！真是完美
Merlin's beard! It is perfect.

384
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:24,151
太完美了，我敢说只要一滴 就能让全班的人都睡死过去
So perfect I daresay one drop would kill us all.

385
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:29,411
好了，如我所承诺的
So here we are, then, as promised.

386
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,785
奖励福灵剂一瓶
One vial of Felix Felicis.

387
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,999
恭喜
Congratulations.

388
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:38,256
好好使用
Use it well.

389
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:08,537
哈利，你收到信了，进来吧
Harry, you got my message. Come in.

390
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,581
最近怎样？
How are you?

391
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:13,291
很好，教授
I'm fine, sir.

392
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:14,704
课还喜欢吗？
Enjoying your classes?

393
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,997
我知道斯拉格霍恩教授尤为喜欢你
I know Professor Slughorn is most impressed with you.

394
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:22,004
我想他是高估我的水平了
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.

395
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:23,833
你真这么想？
Do you?

396
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:25,631
千真万确
Definitely.

397
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,475
你的课外活动如何啊？
What about your activities outside the classroom?

398
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:33,678
- 您什么意思？ - 我注意到…
- Sir? - Well, I notice you spend...

399
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:36,475
你经常和格兰杰小姐一起出入
...a great deal of time with Miss Granger.

400
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:37,893
所以忍不住猜测…
I can't help wondering...

401
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:43,061
哦，没，没有，她是很棒 我们也是朋友，但不是您猜的那样
Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant, and we're friends, but, no.

402
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:46,239
敬请原谅，我这纯属好奇
Forgive me. I was merely being curious.

403
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:49,200
闲聊得够多的了
But enough chitchat.

404
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:52,994
我一定在奇怪，我今晚为什么要请你过来
You must be wondering why I summoned you here tonight.

405
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:56,417
答案就在这里
The answer lies here.

406
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,578
你所看到的这些都是记忆
What you are looking at are memories.

407
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:03,587
在这个小瓶里装的，就是关于伏地魔的…
In this case, pertaining to one individual, Voldemort...

408
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:06,215
或者我们可以称之为，汤姆・里德尔
...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.

409
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:13,096
这个小瓶里装的记忆
This vial contains the most particular memory...

410
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:15,475
就是我第一次见到他时候的情景
...of the day I first met him.

411
00:39:16,814 --> 00:39:19,601
你要是愿意，我很希望你能看看
I'd like you to see it, if you would.

412
00:39:57,229 --> 00:40:01,476
我得承认，接到你的来信我有些困惑 邓不利多先生
I admit some confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.

413
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,400
【沃尔孤儿院】
wool's orphan

414
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:05,268
这么多年了，从来没有什么亲戚来看过汤姆
In all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor.

415
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:09,194
其他孩子身上发生过一些事故，可怕的事故
There have been incidents with the other children. Nasty things.

416
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,777
汤姆，有人来看望你了
Tom, you have a visitor.

417
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,989
你过得怎么样，汤姆？
How do you do, Tom?

418
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:24,750
别碰
Don't.

419
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:35,676
- 你是医生，是不是？ - 不是
- You're the doctor, aren't you? - No.

420
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:37,891
我是教授
I am a professor.

421
00:40:38,604 --> 00:40:40,431
我不信
I don't believe you.

422
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:42,598
她想让我去看病
She wants me looked at.

423
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:45,398
他们觉得我跟别人不一样
They think I'm different.

424
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:47,063
嗯，他们可能还真说对了
Well, perhaps they're right.

425
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:48,696
我没疯
I'm not mad.

426
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:52,198
霍格沃兹不是疯人院
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.

427
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:54,360
霍格沃兹是所学校
Hogwarts is a school.

428
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,283
传授魔法的学校
A school of magic.

429
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:03,544
你能做一些事，对不对，汤姆？
You can do things, can't you, Tom?

430
00:41:04,672 --> 00:41:07,341
一些别的孩子做不到的事
Things other children can't.

431
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:11,671
我不用碰，就能让东西动起来
I can make things move without touching them.

432
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:16,179
我不用教，就能让动物听我的话
I can make animals do what I want without training them.

433
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:20,510
如果有谁对我不好，我就能让他遭殃
I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me.

434
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,103
我能伤害他们…
I can make them hurt...

435
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:25,274
只要我想
...if I want.

436
00:41:25,818 --> 00:41:27,691
你是谁？
Who are you?

437
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:30,068
我跟你一样，汤姆
Well, I'm like you, Tom.

438
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,698
与众不同
I'm different.

439
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:35,153
证明给我看
Prove it.

440
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:46,583
你的衣柜里好像有些什么东西 想钻出来啊，汤姆
I think there's something in your wardrobe trying to get out, Tom.

441
00:41:56,306 --> 00:42:00,090
霍格沃兹不容许偷窃
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts, Tom.

442
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:05,939
在霍格沃兹，你不仅要学习如何使用魔法 还要学习如何控制魔法
At Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only how to use magic, but how to control it.

443
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:07,271
明白我的意思吗？
You understand me?

444
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:13,776
我还能和蛇说话
I can speak to snakes too.

445
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:16,825
是它们找到我的
They find me.

446
00:42:17,828 --> 00:42:19,737
跟我说悄悄话
Whisper things.

447
00:42:19,997 --> 00:42:23,117
这对像我这样的人来说，正常吗？
Is that normal for someone like me?

448
00:42:44,188 --> 00:42:47,473
你当时知道吗，教授？
Did you know, sir? Then?

449
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:53,273
知道我刚见到了有史以来最邪恶的黑巫师？ 当然不知道
Did I know I'd just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.

450
00:42:53,864 --> 00:42:55,987
就算我知道，我也…
If I had, I...

451
00:42:57,618 --> 00:43:00,073
他在霍格沃兹的这些年里…
Over time, while here at Hogwarts...

452
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:03,579
汤姆・里德尔和一个老师走得特别近
...Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher.

453
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:05,576
猜猜看那个老师是谁？
Can you guess who that teacher might be?

454
00:43:08,504 --> 00:43:11,955
你劝斯拉格霍恩教授回来 不止是教魔药课，对吧？
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you?

455
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:14,172
不，不止
No, I did not.

456
00:43:14,343 --> 00:43:18,175
斯拉格霍恩教授有一样东西 是我迫切需要的
You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly.

457
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:21,055
他自然也不会轻易地交出来
And he will not give it up easily.

458
00:43:21,225 --> 00:43:24,428
你说他会想招我入门
You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.

459
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:25,848
是的
I did.

460
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:28,556
你想要我答应吗？
Do you want me to let him?

461
00:43:29,942 --> 00:43:31,317
是的
Yes.

462
00:44:55,486 --> 00:44:57,194
好了，嗯…
All right. Um...

463
00:44:57,363 --> 00:45:00,447
今早，我们会进行几轮选拔
This morning, I'm gonna be putting you all through a few drills...

464
00:45:00,616 --> 00:45:02,739
考核你们的实力
...just to assess your strengths.

465
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:05,445
请安静下！
Quiet! Please!

466
00:45:05,621 --> 00:45:06,783
都闭嘴！
Shut it!

467
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:13,378
多谢，那个，然后…
Thanks. All right. Um...

468
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:15,668
就算你们去年是正式队员
Just because you made the team last year...

469
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,793
我不保证你们今年也是 这么说，明白了吗？
...does not guarantee you a spot this year. Is that clear?

470
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:22,584
很好
Good.

471
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:33,520
韦斯莱，别介意，好嘛？
No hard feelings, Weasley, all right?

472
00:45:34,066 --> 00:45:35,264
介意？
Hard feelings?

473
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:38,977
我也要打守球手这个位置 真不是针对你
Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well. It's nothing personal.

474
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:41,824
真的？以你这个头？
Really? Strapping guy like you?

475
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,564
你不觉得你更适合当击球手吗？
You've got more of a Beater's build, don't you think?

476
00:45:44,743 --> 00:45:47,151
守球手要眼疾手快
Keepers need to be quick, agile.

477
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:50,330
哦，我还是想先试试运气
Oh, I like my chances.

478
00:45:50,499 --> 00:45:54,283
话说，你能给我介绍介绍 你那朋友格兰杰吧？
Say, think you could introduce me to your friend Granger?

479
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:58,625
要能知名知姓就最好了 懂我的意思吗？
Wouldn't mind getting on a first-name basis, know what I mean?

480
00:46:10,936 --> 00:46:12,644
加油，韦斯莱！
Come on, Weasley!

481
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:14,521
- 加油，罗恩！ - 上啊，韦斯莱！
- Come on, Ron! - Go on, Weasley!

482
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:18,937
上！韦斯莱！
- Go on, Weasley! - Yeah, Ron!

483
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:20,356
加油，考迈克！
Go on, Cormac!

484
00:46:36,879 --> 00:46:38,955
加油，罗恩！
Come on, Ron!

485
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:51,515
加油啊，罗恩
Come on, Ron.

486
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:10,574
速速混淆
Confundus.

487
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:29,004
他真是太棒了！
Isn't he brilliant?

488
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:35,266
老实说，最后一个我真没想到能接住
I have to admit, I thought I was gonna miss that last one.

489
00:47:35,604 --> 00:47:38,391
但愿考迈克别太难受
I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.

490
00:47:38,816 --> 00:47:41,852
他对你有点意思，赫敏，就那个考迈克
He's got a bit of a thing for you, Hermione. Cormac.

491
00:47:42,945 --> 00:47:44,937
他可不讨人喜欢
He's vile.

492
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:52,152
你们听说过这个咒语吗？ 神锋无影？
Have you ever heard of this spell? Sectumsempra?

493
00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:54,405
没听过
No, I haven't.

494
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:57,701
你要是还尊敬自己那么一点点 你就该把书上交
And if you had a shred of self-respect, you'd hand that book in.

495
00:47:57,876 --> 00:48:00,332
想都别想，他现在可是尖子生
Not bloody likely. He's top of the class.

496
00:48:00,504 --> 00:48:04,668
比你都强呢，赫敏 斯拉格霍恩都把他当天才了
He's even better than you, Hermione. Slughorn thinks he's a genius.

497
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:07,081
咋了？
What?

498
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:10,633
我想知道这书到底是谁的 给我看看
I'd like to know whose that book was. Let's have a look.

499
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:12,300
不给
No.

500
00:48:13,809 --> 00:48:15,089
为什么不？
Why not?

501
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:17,269
这书的装订线都松了
The binding is fragile.

502
00:48:17,438 --> 00:48:20,059
- 装订松了？ - 嗯
- The binding is fragile? - Yeah.

503
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,897
- 混血王子是谁？ - 谁？
- Who's the Half-Blood Prince? - Who?

504
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:29,820
这里是这么写的： “此书乃混血王子之财产”
That's what it says right here: "This book is property of the Half-Blood Prince."

505
00:48:47,176 --> 00:48:50,509
这么久了，你到哪都带着这本书 就差抱着它睡觉了
For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it...

506
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:52,968
可你却一点都不想知道这人是谁？
... yet you have no desire to find out who he is?

507
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,556
我没说我不好奇 再说我还没到抱着它睡觉的地步
I didn't say I wasn't curious, and I don't sleep with it.

508
00:48:56,727 --> 00:48:57,758
也也差不多了
Well, it's true.

509
00:48:57,936 --> 00:49:01,685
我想睡前夜谈，你就只知道捧着本书看
I like a nice chat before I go to bed. Now all you do is read that bloody book.

510
00:49:01,857 --> 00:49:03,850
简直跟赫敏第二过日子一样
It's just like being with Hermione.

511
00:49:05,152 --> 00:49:07,643
我有些好奇，所以就去…
Well, I was curious, so I went to...

512
00:49:07,821 --> 00:49:10,359
- 图书馆 - 然后呢？
- The library. - The library. And?

513
00:49:11,283 --> 00:49:12,908
什么都没找到
And nothing.

514
00:49:13,077 --> 00:49:16,113
无论什么地方 都没有提到过混血王子半句
I couldn't find a reference anywhere to a Half-Blood Prince.

515
00:49:16,288 --> 00:49:18,364
- 那就是了，这事就算完了 - 费力斯！
- There we go. That settles it, then. - Filius!

516
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,866
我还想能在三把扫帚里找见你呢！
I was hoping to find you in the Three Broomsticks!

517
00:49:21,043 --> 00:49:25,705
恐怕不行了，合唱团急训，霍拉斯
No, emergency choir practice, I'm afraid, Horace.

518
00:49:29,218 --> 00:49:31,625
有人想喝黄油啤酒吗？
Does anyone fancy a Butterbeer?

519
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,212
我有个老伙计，在克拉克比山上滑雪
A chum of mine was sledging down Claxby Hill.

520
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:38,008
我们有辆自己造的，挪威风格的长雪橇
We had a very long, homemade, Norwegian-style sledge...

521
00:49:38,185 --> 00:49:40,641
别，别去那边，到这边来
No, not there. Over here.

522
00:49:41,271 --> 00:49:42,814
别坐对面，坐我旁边
No, sit beside me.

523
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:45,847
好了
Okay.

524
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:48,694
喝点什么？
Something to drink?

525
00:49:48,862 --> 00:49:51,400
三杯黄油啤酒 我的那份放点姜汁，谢谢
Three Butterbeers, and some ginger in mine, please.

526
00:50:03,168 --> 00:50:05,126
我靠
Oh, bloody hell.

527
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:09,917
是那个小白脸
Slick git.

528
00:50:10,259 --> 00:50:12,928
罗恩，他们只是在牵牵小手
Honestly, Ronald, they're only holding hands.

529
00:50:15,764 --> 00:50:17,009
又亲亲小嘴了
And snogging.

530
00:50:17,683 --> 00:50:20,637
- 我得走了 - 怎么回事？
- I'd like to leave. - What?

531
00:50:20,811 --> 00:50:22,389
你不会是认真的吧
You can't be serious.

532
00:50:22,563 --> 00:50:24,935
- 那可是我妹妹 - 那又怎么了？
- That happens to be my sister. - So?

533
00:50:25,107 --> 00:50:29,021
要是她转头看到你亲我怎么办？ 你想她会走开吗？
What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me? You expect her to leave?

534
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,776
- 嘿！ - 您好，教授，真高兴见到您
- Hey, my boy! - Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.

535
00:50:32,948 --> 00:50:34,941
我也是，我也是
And you, and you.

536
00:50:35,117 --> 00:50:36,908
您来这做什么啊？
So, what brings you here?

537
00:50:37,077 --> 00:50:41,786
三把扫帚和我的渊源说起来可就深了
The Three Broomsticks and I go way back, further than I care to admit.

538
00:50:41,957 --> 00:50:45,408
我还记得当初 它叫一把扫帚时候的样子呢
I can remember when it was One Broomstick.

539
00:50:45,586 --> 00:50:48,919
注意喽，格兰杰 这样，孩子，过去呢…
All hands on deck, Granger. Listen, my boy, in the old days...

540
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:52,505
我会偶尔举办几场晚宴
...I used to throw together the occasional supper party...

541
00:50:52,676 --> 00:50:54,883
只邀请那么一两个学生
...for the select student or two.

542
00:50:55,054 --> 00:50:58,921
- 你愿意来吗？ - 荣幸之至，教授
- Would you be game? - I'd consider it an honor, sir.

543
00:51:00,351 --> 00:51:02,557
也欢迎你来，格兰杰
You would be welcome too, Granger.

544
00:51:03,354 --> 00:51:08,099
- 太谢谢了，教授 - 好极了，等我的猫头鹰送信哦
- I'd be delighted, sir. - Splendid. Look for my owl.

545
00:51:08,984 --> 00:51:10,941
真高兴见到你，华伦比 （彻底记错罗恩名字了）
Good to see you, Wallenby.

546
00:51:15,866 --> 00:51:17,574
你这是玩的哪一手？
What are you playing at?

547
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:21,695
邓不利多让我多了解他
Dumbledore's asked me to get to know him.

548
00:51:21,872 --> 00:51:23,829
- 了解他？ - 不晓得
- Get to know him? - I don't know.

549
00:51:23,999 --> 00:51:27,748
这事一定很重要 要不然，邓不利多也不会让我去
It must be important. If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.

550
00:51:33,342 --> 00:51:35,465
你嘴角有一点…
Got a little bit...

551
00:51:46,355 --> 00:51:48,229
凯蒂，你都不知道这里装的是什么
Katie, you don't know what it could be.

552
00:51:48,399 --> 00:51:49,857
- 哈利 - 什么事？
- Harry. - What?

553
00:51:50,025 --> 00:51:53,525
她在酒吧里说的那段话，关于我俩亲亲的 你也听到了吧？
Did you hear what she said back at the pub about me and her snogging?

554
00:51:54,321 --> 00:51:56,065
貌似
As if.

555
00:52:02,496 --> 00:52:05,830
我警告过她的，让她别碰
I warned her. I warned her not to touch it.

556
00:52:27,312 --> 00:52:30,064
别靠近，所有人，都退后
Don't get any closer. Get back, all of you.

557
00:52:42,578 --> 00:52:47,405
除非包着，否则别碰，记住了吗？
Do not touch that, except by the wrappings. Do you understand?

558
00:53:00,888 --> 00:53:03,461
你确定凯蒂进三把扫帚的时候
You're sure Katie did not have this in her possession...

559
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,132
没带着这个？
...when she entered the Three Broomsticks?

560
00:53:06,769 --> 00:53:08,311
我说过了
It's like I said.

561
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:13,432
她去上厕所，回来之后就拿着那个包裹
She left to go to the loo, and when she came back she had the package.

562
00:53:14,693 --> 00:53:17,398
她说，她要把包送到，事关重大
She said it was important that she deliver it.

563
00:53:18,238 --> 00:53:21,738
- 她有没有说，要送到谁那儿？ - 邓不利多教授
- Did she say to whom? - To Professor Dumbledore.

564
00:53:22,076 --> 00:53:24,745
很好，谢谢你，黎安，你先走吧
Very well. Thank you, Leanne. You may go.

565
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:34,962
为什么每次有什么事发生 总是你们在场？
Why is it when something happens it is always you three?

566
00:53:36,048 --> 00:53:40,461
相信我，教授 我问自己这个问题问了都六年了
Believe me, professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years.

567
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:42,589
哦，西弗勒斯
McGONAGALL: Oh, Severus.

568
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:50,184
你怎么看？
What do you think?

569
00:53:52,106 --> 00:53:56,898
我看，贝尔小姐还能活着，真是幸运
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.

570
00:53:57,069 --> 00:53:59,311
她被下了恶咒，是不是？
She was cursed, wasn't she?

571
00:53:59,488 --> 00:54:02,157
我知道凯蒂，在魁地奇球场之外的地方 她连只苍蝇都舍不得伤害
I know Katie. Off the pitch, she wouldn't hurt a fly.

572
00:54:02,658 --> 00:54:06,241
就算她要把包裹交给邓不利多 也肯定不是有意识的
If she was delivering that to Dumbledore, she wasn't doing it knowingly.

573
00:54:06,412 --> 00:54:08,321
她肯定是被下了恶咒
Yes, she was cursed.

574
00:54:09,123 --> 00:54:10,783
是马尔福干的
It was Malfoy.

575
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:16,494
波特，这个指控非常严重
That is a very serious accusation, Potter.

576
00:54:16,672 --> 00:54:18,166
的确
Indeed.

577
00:54:19,008 --> 00:54:22,423
- 你有什么证据？ - 我就是知道
- Your evidence? - I just know.

578
00:54:23,178 --> 00:54:25,171
你就是…
You just...

579
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:27,801
知道
...know.

580
00:54:30,853 --> 00:54:32,762
你的天赋可真是了不得，波特
You astonish with your gifts, Potter.

581
00:54:32,938 --> 00:54:36,888
你的天赋，凡人做梦也别想有
Gifts mere mortals can only dream of possessing.

582
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:43,188
多么伟大，你这救世主
How grand it must be to be the Chosen One.

583
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:51,369
我建议，你们都回宿舍去，所有人
I suggest you go back to your dormitories. All of you.

584
00:55:01,884 --> 00:55:04,801
你觉得迪安看上金妮哪点了?
What do you suppose Dean sees in her? Ginny?

585
00:55:06,513 --> 00:55:08,506
那金妮又看上他什么呢？
Well, what does she see in him?

586
00:55:08,682 --> 00:55:10,889
迪安？他很聪明啊
Dean? He's brilliant.

587
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:13,895
不到五个小时之前，你还叫他小白脸
You called him a slick git not five hours ago.

588
00:55:14,063 --> 00:55:17,847
那个，他那会不是对我妹妹动手动脚嘛
Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he?

589
00:55:18,025 --> 00:55:22,568
神经一绷，你就非恨他不可，懂不？ 那是原则问题
Something snaps, and you've gotta hate him, you know? On principle.

590
00:55:23,238 --> 00:55:24,733
大概吧
I suppose.

591
00:55:25,991 --> 00:55:29,158
- 那你说，他看上她什么了？ - 不晓得
- So, what is it he sees in her? - I don't know.

592
00:55:29,912 --> 00:55:32,319
她聪明，有趣
She's smart, funny.

593
00:55:33,082 --> 00:55:35,370
- 很迷人 - 迷人？
- Attractive. - Attractive?

594
00:55:36,919 --> 00:55:40,418
- 就是，她皮肤很好啊 - 皮肤？
- You know, she's got nice skin. - Skin?

595
00:55:41,256 --> 00:55:43,083
迪安跟我妹妹好，就因为她皮肤好？
Dean dates my sister because of her skin?

596
00:55:43,258 --> 00:55:47,755
也不是啦，我只是说 这可能是原因之一
Well, no, I mean, I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor.

597
00:55:51,141 --> 00:55:52,885
赫敏的皮肤也很好
Hermione's got nice skin.

598
00:55:53,602 --> 00:55:56,354
你不觉得吗？就事论事来说的话
Wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean.

599
00:55:57,314 --> 00:55:59,390
我真没想过这个问题
I've never really thought about it.

600
00:56:00,943 --> 00:56:02,651
不过，我估计，是的吧
But, I suppose, yeah.

601
00:56:03,404 --> 00:56:04,862
是很好
Very nice.

602
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:12,653
- 我该睡觉了 - 哦，对
- I think I'll be going to sleep now. - Right. Yeah.

603
00:56:22,506 --> 00:56:26,456
说说吧，考迈克，最近 有没有见你叔叔贝卢斯啊？
So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything of your Uncle Tiberius these days?

604
00:56:26,635 --> 00:56:29,126
有的，教授，实际上 这个假期，我该去和他…
Yes, sir. In fact, I'm meant to go hunting with him...

605
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:31,511
还有魔法部部长一起去打猎
...and the Minister for Magic over the holidays.

606
00:56:31,682 --> 00:56:34,636
别忘了代我向他们二位问好
Well, be sure to give them both my best.

607
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:36,803
你叔叔呢，巴尔比？
What about your uncle, Belby?

608
00:56:36,979 --> 00:56:40,430
以防有人没听说过，我介绍一下 马科斯的叔叔发明了狼毒药剂（防止狼人变身的药）
For those who don't know, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.

609
00:56:40,607 --> 00:56:43,395
- 他最近有在搞什么新发明啊？ - 不晓得
- Is he working on anything new? - Don't know.

610
00:56:43,569 --> 00:56:47,649
他和我爸关系不好，可能是因为 我爸说魔药都是垃圾
Him and Dad don't get on. Probably because me dad says potions are rubbish.

611
00:56:47,823 --> 00:56:51,109
他说唯一有用的魔药 就是回家喝的几口烈酒
Says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the day.

612
00:56:51,285 --> 00:56:56,410
你呢，格兰杰小姐？ 你父母在麻瓜的世界里哪里高就啊？
What about you, Miss Granger? What does your family do in the Muggle world?

613
00:56:57,166 --> 00:56:58,992
我父母都是牙医
My parents are dentists.

614
00:57:03,547 --> 00:57:04,827
给别人治牙齿
They tend to people's teeth.

615
00:57:05,007 --> 00:57:09,752
太有趣了，这个职业危险吗？
Fascinating. And is that considered a dangerous profession?

616
00:57:09,928 --> 00:57:11,209
不算是
No.

617
00:57:13,182 --> 00:57:17,678
不过，是有个男孩，叫罗宾・芬克 咬了我爸爸一口
Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick, did bite my father once.

618
00:57:17,853 --> 00:57:19,098
害得他缝了十针
He needed 10 stitches.

619
00:57:25,361 --> 00:57:28,979
啊，韦斯莱小姐，快请进
Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.

620
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:36,113
看她眼色，她跟迪安又吵架了
Look at her eyes. They've been fighting again, her and Dean.

621
00:57:36,288 --> 00:57:38,993
抱歉，我一般不会迟到
Sorry. I'm not usually late.

622
00:57:42,795 --> 00:57:47,207
没关系，来得正好，还能来点甜点 当然了，要是还没被巴尔比吃精光
No matter. You're just in time for dessert, that is, if Belby's left you any.

623
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,220
怎么回事？
What?

624
00:57:56,392 --> 00:57:58,016
没什么
Nothing.

625
00:58:04,358 --> 00:58:07,976
再见了，再见
Goodbye. Bye-bye.

626
00:58:12,866 --> 00:58:14,610
- 波特 - 抱歉，教授
- Potter. - I'm sorry, sir.

627
00:58:14,785 --> 00:58:17,358
我刚刚在欣赏您的沙漏
I was just admiring your hourglass.

628
00:58:18,747 --> 00:58:20,206
哦，是啊
Oh, yes.

629
00:58:20,749 --> 00:58:22,789
有趣的小玩意儿
A most intriguing object.

630
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:27,707
沙粒掉落的速度和谈话的质量相关
The sand runs in accordance with the quality of the conversation.

631
00:58:28,007 --> 00:58:31,257
如果谈话有趣，沙粒就落得慢
If it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly.

632
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,669
- 如果无聊… - 我想我该走了
- If it is not... - I think I'll be going.

633
00:58:33,846 --> 00:58:37,179
胡说，你有什么好怕的
Nonsense. You have nothing to fear, dear boy.

634
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:39,591
至于你的一些同学…
As to some of your classmates...

635
00:58:39,768 --> 00:58:43,184
这么说吧，他们可上不了我的架子
...well, let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf.

636
00:58:43,355 --> 00:58:44,849
什么架子，教授？
The shelf, sir?

637
00:58:45,441 --> 00:58:49,059
那些有抱负的学生，都希望想上那儿
Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here.

638
00:58:49,236 --> 00:58:53,103
不过话说回来，你已经是个人物了 不是吗，哈利？
But then again, you already are someone, aren't you, Harry?

639
00:58:54,658 --> 00:58:56,615
伏地魔上过这个架子吗，教授？
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?

640
00:58:58,787 --> 00:59:02,702
您认识他，对吧？ 汤姆・里德尔，您教过他
You knew him, didn't you, sir, Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.

641
00:59:03,792 --> 00:59:07,292
里德尔在霍格沃兹的时候 有过很多老师
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers whilst here at Hogwarts.

642
00:59:07,463 --> 00:59:09,040
他那时候什么样？
What was he like?

643
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,132
抱歉，教授，恕我多问
I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.

644
00:59:15,804 --> 00:59:17,631
他杀死了我父母
He killed my parents.

645
00:59:20,392 --> 00:59:21,673
当然
Of course.

646
00:59:22,061 --> 00:59:25,061
你想多知道一些，可以理解
It's only natural you should want to know more.

647
00:59:27,149 --> 00:59:29,984
不过恐怕我要让你失望了，哈利
But I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry.

648
00:59:30,903 --> 00:59:33,145
我第一次见到里德尔，他虽然聪明…
When I first met Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet...

649
00:59:33,322 --> 00:59:37,569
却很安静，一心想成为一流的巫师
...albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard.

650
00:59:37,743 --> 00:59:39,486
和我认识的其他学生并没有太大区别
Not unlike others I've known.

651
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,155
实际上，和你也没有多大区别
Not unlike yourself, in fact.

652
00:59:43,499 --> 00:59:45,575
要说真有魔鬼…
If the monster existed...

653
00:59:46,126 --> 00:59:48,368
他也藏得很深
...it was buried deep within.

654
01:00:05,688 --> 01:00:07,182
好运，罗恩
Good luck, eh, Ron.

655
01:00:08,607 --> 01:00:11,063
- 这帽子可真帅！ - 罗恩，衰人！
- Nice hat! - Ron, you're a loser.

656
01:00:11,235 --> 01:00:14,319
我可指望你了，罗恩 我压了两加隆赌霍格沃兹赢呢
I'm counting on you, Ron. I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?

657
01:00:14,488 --> 01:00:16,813
- 看起来不错啊，罗恩 - 衰人！
- Looking good, Ron. - Loser!

658
01:00:19,034 --> 01:00:20,528
他戴的是什么玩意？
What's he wearing?

659
01:00:29,169 --> 01:00:30,996
那个怎么样？
So how was it, then?

660
01:00:32,214 --> 01:00:34,539
- 哪个怎么样？ - 你的聚会啊？
- How was what? - Your dinner party?

661
01:00:34,717 --> 01:00:36,341
说真的，挺无聊的
Pretty boring, actually.

662
01:00:37,136 --> 01:00:39,461
不过哈利应该挺喜欢那些点心
Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.

663
01:00:42,891 --> 01:00:45,643
斯拉格霍恩还要开圣诞舞会
Slughorn's having a Christmas do, you know.

664
01:00:45,811 --> 01:00:47,353
我们可以带别人
And we're meant to bring someone.

665
01:00:47,521 --> 01:00:51,222
我猜你会带麦克拉根去吧 他也是鼻涕虫俱乐部的，对不？
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen. He's in the Slug Club, isn't he?

666
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,235
- 其实，本来我是想请你的 - 真的？
- Actually, I was going to ask you. - Really?

667
01:00:57,072 --> 01:00:59,065
今天好运了，罗恩
Good luck today, Ron.

668
01:00:59,908 --> 01:01:02,234
我知道你是最棒的
I know you'll be brilliant.

669
01:01:05,289 --> 01:01:09,037
我要退队，今天比完就退 让麦克拉根接替吧
I'm resigning. After today's match, McLaggen can have my spot.

670
01:01:09,209 --> 01:01:10,704
以后的事由你
Have it your way.

671
01:01:10,878 --> 01:01:13,369
- 来点南瓜汁先？ - 好
- Juice? - Sure.

672
01:01:13,547 --> 01:01:15,255
大家好啊
Hello, everyone.

673
01:01:16,508 --> 01:01:18,584
你看上去糟透了，罗恩
You look dreadful, Ron.

674
01:01:18,761 --> 01:01:21,133
是因为这个 你才往他杯子里放东西吗？
Is that why you put something in his cup?

675
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:24,973
那是补药吗？
Is it a tonic?

676
01:01:28,437 --> 01:01:30,061
幸运水
Liquid luck.

677
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,100
别喝，罗恩
Don't drink it, Ron.

678
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:44,068
- 你这么干会被开除的 - 我可不知道你什么意思
- You could be expelled for that. - I don't know what you're talking about.

679
01:01:46,288 --> 01:01:48,909
来吧，哈利，咱们还有比赛要赢呢！
Come on, Harry. We've got a game to win.

680
01:02:15,067 --> 01:02:17,902
加油，罗恩！搞掂它！
Go on, Ron! Do it!

681
01:02:51,854 --> 01:02:54,142
韦斯莱！
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

682
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:59,601
韦斯莱！
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

683
01:03:09,913 --> 01:03:14,955
韦斯莱！
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

684
01:03:19,214 --> 01:03:20,922
你真不该那么做
You really shouldn't have done it.

685
01:03:21,091 --> 01:03:26,086
我知道，也许我该用混淆咒
I know. I suppose I could've just used a Confundus Charm.

686
01:03:27,097 --> 01:03:31,724
那不一样，那是选拔，这是真正的比赛
That was different. That was tryouts. This was an actual game.

687
01:03:34,521 --> 01:03:36,229
你没放
You didn't put it in.

688
01:03:37,941 --> 01:03:39,768
罗恩只是以为我放了
Ron only thought you did.

689
01:04:27,574 --> 01:04:30,860
咒语，我只是练练
Charms spell. I'm just practicing.

690
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:36,617
真厉害
Well, they're really good.

691
01:04:42,131 --> 01:04:44,123
那是什么感觉，哈利？
How does it feel, Harry?

692
01:04:46,969 --> 01:04:50,172
你看见迪安和金妮一起的时候？
When you see Dean with Ginny?

693
01:04:55,269 --> 01:04:56,728
我都知道
I know.

694
01:04:57,813 --> 01:04:59,971
从你看她的眼神
I see the way you look at her.

695
01:05:00,691 --> 01:05:02,315
你是我最好的朋友
You're my best friend.

696
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:13,237
啊哦
Oops.

697
01:05:14,663 --> 01:05:16,905
这个地方被人占了
I think this room's taken.

698
01:05:18,667 --> 01:05:20,078
这些鸟是怎么回事？
What's with the birds?

699
01:05:23,464 --> 01:05:25,172
万弹齐发
Oppugno.

700
01:05:53,202 --> 01:05:54,910
那种感觉就是这样的
It feels like this.

701
01:06:34,618 --> 01:06:37,654
她要是这么爱发神经，我也没办法
Look, I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist.

702
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:42,907
拉弗和我，我这么说吧 简直是停不下啊
What Lav and I have, well, let's just say, there's no stopping it.

703
01:06:43,085 --> 01:06:44,496
传说中爱的化学反应
It's chemical.

704
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:48,999
我们会不会长久？谁知道呢？ 关键是，我可是自由身
Will it last? Who knows? Point is, I'm a free agent.

705
01:06:49,174 --> 01:06:52,009
他想亲谁就亲谁
He's at perfect liberty to kiss whoever he likes.

706
01:06:52,177 --> 01:06:54,585
我压根就不想管
I really couldn't care less.

707
01:06:54,763 --> 01:06:58,595
之前我是不是误以为我和他 会一起出席斯拉格霍恩的圣诞晚会？
Was I under the impression he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party?

708
01:06:58,767 --> 01:07:00,261
没错
Yes.

709
01:07:00,436 --> 01:07:04,848
如今，以眼下的情况看 我得另作一些安排了
Now, given the circumstances, I've had to make other arrangements.

710
01:07:05,024 --> 01:07:06,222
你安排好了吗？
Have you?

711
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,393
嗯，怎么了？
Yes. Why?

712
01:07:08,569 --> 01:07:12,187
我以为，既然我们两个 都没有理想的男女伴
I just thought, seeing as neither of us can go with who we'd really like to...

713
01:07:12,364 --> 01:07:14,606
干脆就我们一起，以朋友的身份
...we should go together, as friends.

714
01:07:14,783 --> 01:07:16,408
我之前怎么没想到？
Why didn't I think of that?

715
01:07:16,577 --> 01:07:18,119
你跟谁一起去？
Who are you going with?

716
01:07:18,287 --> 01:07:20,078
呃，惊喜
Um, it's a surprise.

717
01:07:20,247 --> 01:07:24,459
总之，我们要担心的人是你 你不能随便带个人就去
Anyway, it's you we've got to worry about. You can't just take anyone.

718
01:07:25,085 --> 01:07:26,959
看到那边的女孩子了吗？
See that girl over there?

719
01:07:28,589 --> 01:07:33,298
罗米达・万尼，很显然 她想偷带迷魂药进学校
That's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's trying to smuggle you a love potion.

720
01:07:33,469 --> 01:07:34,963
真的？
Really?

721
01:07:35,929 --> 01:07:39,381
嘿！她对你感兴趣无非是因为 她以为你是所谓的救世主
Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.

722
01:07:39,558 --> 01:07:41,266
可我确实是啊
But I am the Chosen One.

723
01:07:41,435 --> 01:07:44,306
好了，抱歉，呃，开开玩笑
Okay, sorry. Um, kidding.

724
01:07:46,315 --> 01:07:47,774
我会请我喜欢的人一起
I'll ask someone I like.

725
01:07:48,567 --> 01:07:50,109
酷一些的
Someone cool.

726
01:07:59,870 --> 01:08:02,906
我从没来过城堡的这个地方
I've never been to this part of the castle.

727
01:08:03,082 --> 01:08:06,332
至少醒着的时候没有，我会梦游
At least not while awake. I sleepwalk, you see.

728
01:08:06,502 --> 01:08:08,993
所以才穿鞋子上床
That's why I wear shoes to bed.

729
01:08:40,202 --> 01:08:43,203
门户开启(这个咒语是导演自己鼓捣出来的 效果是增强消失柜的魔力)
Harmonia Nectere Passus. （detailed explanation，see http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Harmonia_Nectare_Passus）

730
01:08:55,718 --> 01:08:58,469
门户开启
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

731
01:09:00,014 --> 01:09:02,683
门户开启
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

732
01:09:17,322 --> 01:09:18,733
来一杯？
Drink?

733
01:09:19,658 --> 01:09:20,987
纳威
Neville.

734
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,618
我没能进鼻涕虫俱乐部
I didn't get into the Slug Club.

735
01:09:22,786 --> 01:09:25,906
不过没关系 他还让巴尔比在厕所递毛巾呢
It's okay, though. He's got Belby handing out towels in the loo.

736
01:09:26,081 --> 01:09:28,868
- 哦，不用了，谢谢 - 嗯
- Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks. - Okay.

737
01:09:39,303 --> 01:09:42,257
赫敏，你在这干嘛？发生什么事了？
Hermione. What are you doing? And what happened to you?

738
01:09:42,431 --> 01:09:47,722
我刚刚跑掉了 把考迈克丢在槲寄生下头
I've just escaped. I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.

739
01:09:47,895 --> 01:09:50,931
考迈克？你请了他？
Cormac? That's who you invited?

740
01:09:51,106 --> 01:09:53,597
我以为，这样最能惹罗恩不高兴
I thought it would annoy Ron the most.

741
01:09:54,443 --> 01:09:56,436
谢谢，呆会再聊
Thank you. I'll catch up with you later.

742
01:09:56,612 --> 01:09:59,613
他简直比贪吃根还多长了几根触角（满手是吃的） （Snarfalump未在原著出现过，此处根据构词翻译）
He's got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.

743
01:09:59,782 --> 01:10:01,940
- 来点龙肉干？ - 不用了，谢谢
- Dragon tartare? - No, I'm fine. Thank you.

744
01:10:02,117 --> 01:10:04,787
也是，吃了这玩意口气重得不行
Just as well. They give one horribly bad breath.

745
01:10:04,953 --> 01:10:06,780
我改主意了
On second thoughts...

746
01:10:06,955 --> 01:10:08,948
这样或许能让考迈克保持距离
Might keep Cormac at bay.

747
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:12,209
哦，天，他过来了
Oh, God, here he comes.

748
01:10:14,755 --> 01:10:17,626
我想她是去洗手间了
I think she just went to powder her nose.

749
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,876
你这朋友可真是个小泥鳅
Slippery little minx, your friend.

750
01:10:20,052 --> 01:10:22,757
嘴巴也是一刻闲不下来，对吧
Likes to work her mouth too, doesn't she?

751
01:10:25,808 --> 01:10:27,800
我吃的这什么啊？
What is this I'm eating, by the way?

752
01:10:28,977 --> 01:10:30,602
龙蛋蛋
Dragon balls.

753
01:10:41,824 --> 01:10:44,943
你刚刚给你自己 争取到了一个月的禁闭，麦克拉根
You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen.

754
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:48,986
别溜这么快，波特
Not so quick, Potter.

755
01:10:50,541 --> 01:10:53,660
教授，我想我该回去找我的女伴了…
Sir, I really think I should rejoin the party. My date...

756
01:10:53,836 --> 01:10:57,750
你少陪一两分钟，她也死不了
Can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.

757
01:10:57,923 --> 01:11:00,165
再者，我只是来传个口信
Besides, I only wish to convey a message.

758
01:11:00,801 --> 01:11:03,043
- 口信？ - 邓不利多教授
- A message? - From Professor Dumbledore.

759
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:06,885
让我代他问好，祝你聚会愉快
He asked me to give you his best, and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.

760
01:11:07,057 --> 01:11:08,599
你也知道…
You see...

761
01:11:08,767 --> 01:11:14,307
他出校了，得到新学期才回来
...he's traveling, and he won't return until term resumes.

762
01:11:14,481 --> 01:11:16,023
出校，去哪？
Traveling where?

763
01:11:24,158 --> 01:11:26,031
把你的手拿开，你个肮脏的哑炮！
Take your hands off me, you filthy Squib!

764
01:11:27,161 --> 01:11:28,869
斯拉格霍恩教授
Professor Slughorn, sir.

765
01:11:29,038 --> 01:11:33,367
我刚刚发现了这男孩 在楼上的走廊里游荡
I just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor.

766
01:11:33,542 --> 01:11:35,582
他说，你邀请了他参加聚会
He claims to have been invited to your party.

767
01:11:35,753 --> 01:11:39,038
好了好了，我不请自来，行了吧？
Okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?

768
01:11:39,214 --> 01:11:43,046
我领他出去
I'll escort him out.

769
01:11:45,846 --> 01:11:49,511
当然可以，教授
Certainly, professor.

770
01:11:53,145 --> 01:11:56,395
好了，各位，继续
All right, everyone, carry on, carry on.

771
01:11:58,484 --> 01:12:03,395
也许我是给那个叫贝尔的下了咒 也许我没有，关你什么事？
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?

772
01:12:03,572 --> 01:12:05,648
我发过誓要保护你
I swore to protect you.

773
01:12:05,824 --> 01:12:09,158
我立下了牢不可破的誓言
I made the Unbreakable Vow.

774
01:12:09,328 --> 01:12:11,486
我不需要人保护
I don't need protection.

775
01:12:11,663 --> 01:12:15,827
在这么多人当中，他只选了我，我！
I was chosen for this. Out of all others. Me.

776
01:12:16,752 --> 01:12:20,287
- 我不会让他失望 - 你很害怕，德拉科
- And I won't fail him. - You're afraid, Draco.

777
01:12:20,881 --> 01:12:24,795
你试图掩饰，但太明显了，让我帮你
You attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious. Let me assist you.

778
01:12:24,968 --> 01:12:26,427
不！
No!

779
01:12:26,762 --> 01:12:30,178
被他选中，这次的荣耀是我的！
I was chosen. This is my moment.

780
01:12:42,611 --> 01:12:44,189
“牢不可破的誓言”
"Unbreakable Vow."

781
01:12:44,363 --> 01:12:45,987
你确定斯内普这么说的？
You're sure that's what Snape said?

782
01:12:46,156 --> 01:12:48,445
肯定，怎么了？
Positive. Why?

783
01:12:48,617 --> 01:12:52,116
你可不能违背牢不可破的誓言
Well, it's just you can't break an Unbreakable Vow.

784
01:12:52,287 --> 01:12:55,621
这一层我自己就差不多想到了
I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough.

785
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:57,868
你不知道有多严重
You don't understand.

786
01:12:58,502 --> 01:12:59,533
我靠
Oh, bloody hell.

787
01:13:27,364 --> 01:13:29,321
我想你
I miss you.

788
01:13:31,035 --> 01:13:32,577
真可爱
Lovely.

789
01:13:32,745 --> 01:13:36,030
她成天就想亲我 我嘴唇都被亲干了，瞧
All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look.

790
01:13:36,206 --> 01:13:38,413
你说就是了，我信
I'll take your word for it.

791
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:53,468
那后果会多严重？ 如果你违背了牢不可破的誓言？
So, what happens to you? What happens if you break an Unbreakable Vow?

792
01:13:54,016 --> 01:13:55,724
你会死
You die.

793
01:14:00,314 --> 01:14:02,188
布丁还在哦
Wait, the pudding's still here.

794
01:14:03,442 --> 01:14:06,775
伏地魔给德拉科・马尔福 指派了一个任务？
Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission?

795
01:14:06,945 --> 01:14:08,025
我知道听起来很疯狂
I know it sounds mad.

796
01:14:08,197 --> 01:14:11,696
你有没有想过 斯内普只是假装要帮德拉科
Has it occurred to you Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help...

797
01:14:11,867 --> 01:14:14,358
从而套取情报？
...so he could find out what he was up to?

798
01:14:14,536 --> 01:14:17,537
- 听起来不像 - 也许哈利没错
- That's not what it sounded like. - Perhaps Harry's right.

799
01:14:18,082 --> 01:14:19,706
立牢不可破的誓言，是…
To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's...

800
01:14:19,875 --> 01:14:23,374
归根结底，还是看你相不相信 邓不利多的判断
It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgment.

801
01:14:23,545 --> 01:14:27,626
- 邓不利多信任斯内普，所以我也信 - 邓不利多也会犯错
- Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do. - Dumbledore can make mistakes.

802
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:28,962
你是被仇恨蒙蔽了双眼
You're blinded by hatred.

803
01:14:29,134 --> 01:14:31,174
- 我没有 - 你就是
- I'm not. - Yes, you are.

804
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:35,931
天天都有人失踪，哈利
People are disappearing, Harry, daily.

805
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:38,057
我们能信任的人也只剩寥寥几个
We place our trust in a handful of people.

806
01:14:38,227 --> 01:14:41,181
如果现在内讧，我们就输定了
If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed.

807
01:15:05,671 --> 01:15:07,213
张嘴
Open up, you.

808
01:15:08,882 --> 01:15:10,507
不信任我吗？
Don't you trust me?

809
01:15:16,765 --> 01:15:17,844
真好吃
It's good.

810
01:15:18,767 --> 01:15:21,602
嗯…那个…啥
Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah.

811
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:31,147
- 来个派？ - 不用了
- Pie? - Not for me, no.

812
01:15:43,083 --> 01:15:44,625
请你一定体谅莱姆斯
You'll have to forgive Remus.

813
01:15:44,877 --> 01:15:47,712
他这种状况是有一些代价
It takes its toll, his condition.

814
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:50,670
你没事吧，韦斯莱先生？
Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?

815
01:15:50,841 --> 01:15:53,379
我们被人跟踪
We're being followed, all of us.

816
01:15:53,552 --> 01:15:56,043
大多数时候，莫利都不出门
Most days, Molly doesn't leave the house.

817
01:15:56,889 --> 01:15:58,965
日子是不好过
It's not been easy.

818
01:16:00,976 --> 01:16:02,387
你收到我的猫头鹰了吗？
Did you get my owl?

819
01:16:02,561 --> 01:16:04,637
嗯，收到了
Yes, I did.

820
01:16:06,148 --> 01:16:09,184
如果邓不利多出校了 那对魔法部来说肯定是新闻
If Dumbledore's traveling, then that's news to the Ministry...

821
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,815
不过，或许他就是想这样
...but perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it.

822
01:16:12,529 --> 01:16:15,020
至于德拉科・马尔福
As for Draco Malfoy...

823
01:16:15,657 --> 01:16:16,820
我倒是知道得多一点
...I know a bit more.

824
01:16:17,451 --> 01:16:20,487
- 继续说 - 我派人去博金-博克
- Go on. - I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.

825
01:16:20,662 --> 01:16:22,988
从你的描述来看，我想…
I think, from what you described...

826
01:16:23,165 --> 01:16:24,825
夏天你和罗恩看到的…
...what you and Ron saw in summer...

827
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,500
那个让马尔福那么感兴趣的东西…
...the object that Draco is so interested in...

828
01:16:28,671 --> 01:16:30,165
是一个消失柜
...is a vanishing cabinet.

829
01:16:31,048 --> 01:16:32,328
消失柜？
A vanishing cabinet?

830
01:16:32,508 --> 01:16:36,505
那是伏地魔刚得势时候流行的东西
They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power.

831
01:16:36,679 --> 01:16:39,633
你可以想象它的吸引力 要是有食死徒找上门来
You can see the appeal. Should Death Eaters come knocking...

832
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:44,552
你只要躲进柜子里，消失上一两个小时
...one simply had to slip inside and disappear for an hour or two.

833
01:16:45,187 --> 01:16:46,930
这些柜子能把你送到几乎任何一个角落
They can transport you anywhere.

834
01:16:47,106 --> 01:16:50,475
不过这玩意可靠不大住，效果时有时无
Tricky contraptions though, very temperamental.

835
01:16:50,651 --> 01:16:53,568
博金-博克那个怎么样了？
What happened to it? The one at Borgin and Burkes?

836
01:16:53,737 --> 01:16:54,852
没怎样
Nothing.

837
01:16:55,698 --> 01:16:57,405
还在那
It's still there.

838
01:17:08,502 --> 01:17:10,210
晚饭真美味，莫利
It was delicious, Molly, really.

839
01:17:10,379 --> 01:17:11,707
你们真不留下吗？
Are you sure you won't stay?

840
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:16,258
不了，该走了，月初第一天总是最难熬的
No, we should go. The first night of the cycle's always the worst.

841
01:17:16,427 --> 01:17:17,458
莱姆斯？
Remus?

842
01:17:26,395 --> 01:17:27,937
亲爱的
Sweetheart.

843
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:37,981
罗恩上床去了吗？
Has Ron gone to bed?

844
01:17:38,157 --> 01:17:40,992
呃，还没吧
Um... Not yet. No.

845
01:17:42,786 --> 01:17:44,115
鞋带松了
Shoelace.

846
01:17:56,717 --> 01:17:58,591
圣诞快乐，哈利
Merry Christmas, Harry.

847
01:18:00,012 --> 01:18:01,554
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas.

848
01:18:18,822 --> 01:18:21,111
- 哈利，别去！ - 莱姆斯！
- Harry, no! - Remus!

849
01:18:30,959 --> 01:18:32,370
金妮！
Ginny!

850
01:18:35,547 --> 01:18:40,209
我杀了小天狼星布莱克！
I killed Sirius Black! I killed Sirius Black!

851
01:18:40,386 --> 01:18:42,627
你来抓我啊
You coming to get me?

852
01:18:43,722 --> 01:18:47,056
哈利，你抓得到我吗？
Harry, can you get me? You coming to get me?

853
01:19:16,797 --> 01:19:18,172
哈利？
Harry?

854
01:19:35,691 --> 01:19:37,351
昏昏倒地！
Stupefy!

855
01:20:00,215 --> 01:20:01,959
哈利！
Harry!

856
01:20:15,481 --> 01:20:16,679
金妮
Ginny!

857
01:20:46,261 --> 01:20:47,756
莫利
Molly.

858
01:21:10,744 --> 01:21:12,452
他们要害你太容易了 【预言家日报--魔法部称失踪事件不断】
It's easy for them to get to you.

859
01:21:12,621 --> 01:21:16,749
你没死都是运气好 哈利，你该明白，你有多重要
You're bloody lucky you weren't killed. You have to realize who you are, Harry.

860
01:21:16,917 --> 01:21:19,455
我知道，赫敏，好了吧？
I know who I am, Hermione, all right?

861
01:21:20,421 --> 01:21:21,619
对不起
Sorry.

862
01:21:23,298 --> 01:21:26,632
拉弗，我当然会戴了
Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.

863
01:21:26,802 --> 01:21:28,960
这才是我的好恩恩
That's my Won-Won.

864
01:21:30,973 --> 01:21:33,380
抱歉，我得去吐会
Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.

865
01:21:51,035 --> 01:21:53,323
我很想知道，你是哪儿得到的消息
I'd like to know where you get your information.

866
01:21:53,495 --> 01:21:56,532
你比多半的教工还消息灵通
More knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.

867
01:22:02,171 --> 01:22:03,713
教授…
Sir...

868
01:22:04,173 --> 01:22:07,008
梅乐思教授要退休了，是真的吗？
...is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?

869
01:22:07,176 --> 01:22:09,963
哎呀，汤姆，我肯定不能 直接告诉你我知道，对不对？
Now, Tom. I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?

870
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:14,384
还有，多谢你带来的菠萝 这确实是我的最爱
By the way, thank you for the pineapple. You're quite right, it is my favorite.

871
01:22:14,975 --> 01:22:17,264
不过你是怎么知道的？
But how did you know?

872
01:22:19,104 --> 01:22:20,682
直觉
Intuition.

873
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:26,568
天呀，都到点了吗？
Gracious. Is it that time already?

874
01:22:26,737 --> 01:22:30,402
都回去吧，孩子们，要不然 迪佩特校长可要罚你们全关禁闭了
Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet will have us all in detention.

875
01:22:34,536 --> 01:22:38,368
赶快啊，汤姆，你可不想 在熄灯之后被人抓个正着吧
Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught out of bed after hours.

876
01:22:40,292 --> 01:22:42,368
- 有什么事吗，汤姆？ - 有，教授
- Is something on your mind, Tom? - Yes, sir.

877
01:22:43,712 --> 01:22:46,547
是这样，我想不出还能找谁
You see, I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.

878
01:22:47,466 --> 01:22:52,461
别的教授，他们不像你
The other professors, well, they're not like you.

879
01:22:52,846 --> 01:22:55,883
他们或许会误解我
They might misunderstand.

880
01:22:56,058 --> 01:22:57,636
继续说
Go on.

881
01:22:58,435 --> 01:23:00,724
某天晚上我在图书馆
I was in the library the other night...

882
01:23:01,271 --> 01:23:03,478
禁书区
...in the Restricted Section...

883
01:23:04,233 --> 01:23:07,768
读到一些关于某种罕见魔法的材料
...and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic.

884
01:23:08,696 --> 01:23:12,195
我想，您或许可以指点我
And I thought perhaps you could illuminate me.

885
01:23:12,366 --> 01:23:15,153
要是我没记错，那个东西叫…
It's called, as I understand it...

886
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,243
你说什么？
I beg your pardon?

887
01:23:19,415 --> 01:23:22,997
这种东西，我听都没听过 就算知道，也不会告诉你！
I don't know anything about such things, and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!

888
01:23:23,168 --> 01:23:27,961
马上给我离开这里 以后也别再跟我提起这件事！
Now, get out of here at once, and don't let me ever catch you mentioning it again!

889
01:23:30,926 --> 01:23:32,089
很困惑吧？
Confused?

890
01:23:32,761 --> 01:23:34,255
你要是不觉得，我倒会很吃惊
I'd be surprised if you weren't.

891
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:37,932
我不明白，刚才那是怎么回事？
Well, I don't understand. What happened?

892
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:41,765
这或许是我所搜集的记忆中最重要的
This is perhaps the most important memory I've collected.

893
01:23:42,104 --> 01:23:43,847
但这同时也是个谎言
It is also a lie.

894
01:23:44,773 --> 01:23:46,565
这个记忆被篡改过
This memory has been tampered with...

895
01:23:46,734 --> 01:23:51,111
就是被它的主人，我们的老朋友 斯拉格霍恩教授
...by the same person whose memory it is, our old friend, Professor Slughorn.

896
01:23:51,739 --> 01:23:53,731
他为什么要改自己的记忆？
But why would he tamper with his own memory?

897
01:23:53,907 --> 01:23:56,778
- 我猜，他是以此为耻 - 为什么？
- I suspect he's ashamed of it. - Why?

898
01:23:56,952 --> 01:23:58,446
是啊，为什么？
Why, indeed?

899
01:23:59,246 --> 01:24:02,615
我让你去接近斯拉格霍恩教授 你也办到了
I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.

900
01:24:02,791 --> 01:24:06,409
接着，我想请你，劝他交出真实的记忆
Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory...

901
01:24:06,587 --> 01:24:08,129
无论你用什么办法都行
...any way you can.

902
01:24:08,297 --> 01:24:10,254
我不是那么了解他，教授
I don't know him that well, sir.

903
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,637
这段记忆就是一切
This memory is everything.

904
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:20,133
没有它，我们无异于瞎子
Without it, we are blind.

905
01:24:20,642 --> 01:24:24,261
没有它，我们只能 将这世界的命运拱手相让
Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.

906
01:24:26,315 --> 01:24:28,142
你别无选择
You have no choice.

907
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,352
你不能失败
You must not fail.

908
01:24:39,453 --> 01:24:41,778
我强烈建议各位重新温习
So I'd highly recommend you reacquaint yourself...

909
01:24:41,955 --> 01:24:43,414
解药这一章
...with the chapter on antidotes.

910
01:24:43,582 --> 01:24:47,331
下节课我们继续讲解牛粪石的神奇功效 现在下课
I'll tell you more about bezoars in our next class. Right, off you go.

911
01:24:47,503 --> 01:24:49,994
啊哈，这不是我的小尾巴嘛
Alys, don't forget your rat tail.

912
01:24:55,469 --> 01:24:59,253
啊哈，这不是我的魔药王子嘛
Aha. If it isn't the Prince of Potions himself.

913
01:24:59,431 --> 01:25:01,340
有什么是我可以效劳的啊？
To what do I owe this pleasure?

914
01:25:02,518 --> 01:25:04,594
教授，我能不能向您请教点事情
Sir, I wondered if I might ask you something.

915
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:07,012
尽管问吧，孩子，尽管问
Ask away, dear boy, ask away.

916
01:25:07,189 --> 01:25:10,190
前几天晚上，我在图书馆的禁书区
The other day I was in the library, in the Restricted Section...

917
01:25:10,359 --> 01:25:14,024
读到了一些关于某种罕见魔法的材料
...and I came across something rather odd about a very rare piece of magic.

918
01:25:15,364 --> 01:25:18,033
嗯，那个东西叫什么？
Yes. And what was this rare piece of magic?

919
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:21,534
我记不大清楚了
Well, I don't know. I can't remember the name exactly.

920
01:25:21,704 --> 01:25:26,033
所以我在想，是不是有些魔法 教授们是不能教学生的？
It got me wondering, are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach us?

921
01:25:28,043 --> 01:25:29,372
我只是魔药课老师，哈利
I'm Potions Master, Harry.

922
01:25:29,545 --> 01:25:32,380
我想这个问题你最好还是问斯内普教授
I think your question'd better be posed to Professor Snape.

923
01:25:32,548 --> 01:25:34,457
没错，呃
Yes. Um...

924
01:25:34,633 --> 01:25:37,124
可是他跟我，看对方都不是很顺眼
He and I don't exactly see eye to eye, sir.

925
01:25:37,302 --> 01:25:39,094
我的意思是
What I mean to say is...

926
01:25:39,930 --> 01:25:41,721
他不像您
...well, he's not like you.

927
01:25:42,391 --> 01:25:44,218
他会误解我
He might misunderstand.

928
01:25:45,519 --> 01:25:49,351
是啊，没有黑暗哪里有光明
Yes. There can be no light without the dark.

929
01:25:49,523 --> 01:25:53,568
魔法也是如此，而我 总是努力活在光明的一面
And so it is with magic. Myself, I always strive to live within the light.

930
01:25:54,194 --> 01:25:55,854
我建议，你也这么做
I suggest you do the same.

931
01:25:56,238 --> 01:25:59,239
汤姆・里德尔问您这个问题的时候 您也是这么回答他说的吗？
Is that what you told Tom Riddle, when he came asking questions?

932
01:26:06,206 --> 01:26:09,243
邓不利多安排你来的，是不是？
Dumbledore put you up to this, didn't he?

933
01:26:11,253 --> 01:26:12,878
是不是！？
Didn't he?

934
01:26:20,262 --> 01:26:21,543
是
Yes?

935
01:26:21,930 --> 01:26:24,053
哦，是你啊，波特
Oh, it's you, Potter.

936
01:26:24,224 --> 01:26:26,597
抱歉，我现在很忙
I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.

937
01:26:39,406 --> 01:26:43,190
真美，是不？这个月亮
It's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.

938
01:26:44,203 --> 01:26:45,613
美极了
Divine.

939
01:26:46,288 --> 01:26:48,577
好好享用了点睡前甜点，对不？
Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?

940
01:26:49,708 --> 01:26:53,291
盒子就放在你床上 我想吃一颗也没大碍
It was on your bed, the box. I just thought I'd try one.

941
01:26:53,462 --> 01:26:56,961
- 或者是吃20颗 - 我没有一刻不想她，哈利
- Or 20. - I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.

942
01:26:57,132 --> 01:26:59,125
说实话，我还以为你觉得她烦了呢
Honestly, I reckoned she was annoying you.

943
01:26:59,301 --> 01:27:01,626
她怎么可能会烦到我
She could never annoy me.

944
01:27:03,430 --> 01:27:04,972
我想，我是爱上她了
I think I love her.

945
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,849
嗯，太好了
Well, brilliant.

946
01:27:14,692 --> 01:27:16,316
你觉得她知道我的存在吗？
Do you think she knows I exist?

947
01:27:16,485 --> 01:27:18,976
但愿吧，她和你都亲了三个多月嘴了
I hope so. She's been snogging you for three months.

948
01:27:19,154 --> 01:27:22,108
亲嘴？你说谁啊？
Snogging? Who are you talking about?

949
01:27:23,033 --> 01:27:24,278
你说的又是谁？
Who are you talking about?

950
01:27:25,035 --> 01:27:28,653
当然是罗米达，罗米达・万尼
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.

951
01:27:28,831 --> 01:27:30,325
哦，真好笑
Okay, very funny.

952
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:37,125
- 你干嘛？ - 这不是玩笑！我爱上她了！
- What was that for? - It's no joke! I'm in love with her!

953
01:27:37,297 --> 01:27:40,168
好了，你爱上她了，可你见过她吗？
Fine, you're in love with her. Have you ever actually met her?

954
01:27:41,135 --> 01:27:44,089
没，你能给我介绍吗？
No. Can you introduce me?

955
01:28:05,784 --> 01:28:10,530
来，罗恩，我介绍 罗米达・万尼给你认识
Come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you to Romilda Vane.

956
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:25,000
抱歉，教授，如果不是绝对必要 我不会打搅您的
I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely essential.

957
01:28:25,846 --> 01:28:27,257
罗米达在哪？
Where's Romilda?

958
01:28:27,431 --> 01:28:29,388
温比这是怎么了？ （又记错成另一个名字了）
What's the matter with Wenby?

959
01:28:29,892 --> 01:28:31,719
强效迷魂药
Very powerful love potion.

960
01:28:31,894 --> 01:28:34,266
这样，扶他进来吧
Very well. Better bring him in.

961
01:28:34,438 --> 01:28:37,724
我以为调配解药对你来说 是小菜一碟，哈利
I'd have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, Harry.

962
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:40,817
我觉得这个还得经验丰富的高手来，教授
Well, I thought this called for a more practiced hand, sir.

963
01:28:40,986 --> 01:28:44,070
亲爱的，想喝一杯吗？
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?

964
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:45,899
或许你说得没错
Perhaps you're right.

965
01:28:50,412 --> 01:28:55,833
还有，对不起，教授 关于之前的，那些误会
I'm sorry, by the way, professor, about earlier today, our misunderstanding.

966
01:28:56,001 --> 01:29:00,378
哦，哪里哪里 过去的就让它过去吧，对吧？
Oh, not at all. All water under the bridge, you know? Correct?

967
01:29:00,547 --> 01:29:03,465
我想这么多年，您都被问的厌烦了
I expect you're tired of it after all these years.

968
01:29:03,634 --> 01:29:06,207
那些有关伏地魔的事情
All the questions about Voldemort.

969
01:29:06,387 --> 01:29:08,213
别说那个名字
Don't use that name.

970
01:29:15,938 --> 01:29:18,014
好了，大男孩，干光这杯
There you are, old boy. Bottoms up.

971
01:29:18,190 --> 01:29:21,310
- 这是什么？ - 给你壮壮胆
- What's this? - Tonic for the nerves.

972
01:29:35,833 --> 01:29:38,121
- 我怎么了？ - 迷魂药
- What happened to me? - Love potion.

973
01:29:38,293 --> 01:29:40,416
还是强效的
A bloody strong one at that.

974
01:29:41,005 --> 01:29:44,623
- 感觉糟透了 - 你得喝点提神的东西
- I feel really bad. - You need a pick-me-up.

975
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:48,465
我这里有黄油啤酒，葡萄酒 还有陈年的橡树蜜酒
Got Butterbeer, wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.

976
01:29:48,637 --> 01:29:52,966
本来是另有他用的 不过，现在这个情况特殊…
I had other intentions for this, but I think, given the circumstances...

977
01:29:55,269 --> 01:29:56,977
拿好了，波特
Here we are, Potter.

978
01:29:57,146 --> 01:29:58,640
敬人生！
To life!

979
01:30:03,444 --> 01:30:04,475
罗恩
Ron.

980
01:30:06,947 --> 01:30:10,398
罗恩，教授，快想办法啊
Ron. Professor, do something.

981
01:30:11,493 --> 01:30:13,118
我不明白
I don't understand.

982
01:30:29,511 --> 01:30:31,303
加油啊，罗恩，呼吸
Come on, Ron, breathe.

983
01:30:53,535 --> 01:30:56,370
那群女孩，要我命啊
These girls, they're gonna kill me.

984
01:31:07,383 --> 01:31:10,752
脑子转得很快嘛，哈利，想得到用牛粪石 （传说中此物能解百毒-.-暂时的）
Quick thinking on your part, Harry, using a bezoar.

985
01:31:10,928 --> 01:31:13,300
你一定以教出这样的学生为傲吧，霍拉斯
You must be very proud of your student, Horace.

986
01:31:13,472 --> 01:31:16,888
嗯？哦，是，是，很自豪
Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.

987
01:31:17,059 --> 01:31:19,811
我们都同意，波特的行为很英勇
I think we agree, Potter's actions were heroic.

988
01:31:19,978 --> 01:31:23,976
问题是，为什么会发生这种事？
The question is, why were they necessary?

989
01:31:24,149 --> 01:31:25,893
是啊，为什么？
Why, indeed?

990
01:31:26,068 --> 01:31:28,061
这酒看起来是份礼物，霍拉斯
This appears to be a gift, Horace.

991
01:31:28,404 --> 01:31:31,239
你不记得是谁送给你的了？
You don't remember who gave you this bottle?

992
01:31:31,407 --> 01:31:35,356
另外，这酒要是没被下毒
Which, by the way, possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry...

993
01:31:35,536 --> 01:31:37,991
甘草和樱桃的清香还是诱人的
...when not polluted with poison.

994
01:31:38,163 --> 01:31:41,283
实际上，我本来是打算把这个送人的
Actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself.

995
01:31:41,458 --> 01:31:42,834
我能问问，是送谁吗？
To whom, I might ask?

996
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:46,828
送给您，校长
To you, Headmaster.

997
01:31:49,174 --> 01:31:50,254
他在哪？
Where is he?

998
01:31:50,426 --> 01:31:54,554
我的小恩恩在哪？他有没有喊着要见我？
Where's my Won-Won? Has he been asking for me?

999
01:31:57,599 --> 01:31:59,259
她来这干嘛？
What's she doing here?

1000
01:31:59,435 --> 01:32:01,676
我还想问你呢
I might ask you the same question.

1001
01:32:01,854 --> 01:32:04,096
我可是他女朋友
I happen to be his girlfriend.

1002
01:32:04,273 --> 01:32:07,024
我可是他…朋友
I happen to be his friend.

1003
01:32:07,192 --> 01:32:11,404
真是笑掉大牙 你们都好几星期没说话了
Don't make me laugh. You haven't spoken in weeks.

1004
01:32:12,197 --> 01:32:15,068
现在他有意思了，你就想和好啊
I suppose you want to make up now that he's all interesting.

1005
01:32:15,242 --> 01:32:18,943
他中毒了，你个蠢女人！
He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!

1006
01:32:19,121 --> 01:32:21,956
还有，我一直都觉得他很有意思！
And for the record, I've always found him interesting.

1007
01:32:23,625 --> 01:32:28,667
哈，看到没？他感觉到我来了
Ah. See? He senses my presence.

1008
01:32:28,839 --> 01:32:32,125
没担心，小恩恩，我在这儿呢
Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.

1009
01:32:32,801 --> 01:32:34,628
我在这
I'm here.

1010
01:32:40,476 --> 01:32:43,679
呃…赫敏…
Uh... Hermione...

1011
01:32:47,733 --> 01:32:49,726
赫敏
Hermione.

1012
01:32:50,486 --> 01:32:52,727
赫敏
Hermione.

1013
01:33:00,329 --> 01:33:04,243
哦，年轻真好，还能感受爱的伤害啊
Oh, to be young, and to feel love's keen sting.

1014
01:33:04,583 --> 01:33:06,908
好了，大家，都走吧
Well, come away, everybody.

1015
01:33:07,086 --> 01:33:09,707
韦斯莱先生有人照顾了
Mr. Weasley is well tended.

1016
01:33:13,967 --> 01:33:16,505
也是时候了，对吧？
About time, don't you think?

1017
01:33:19,181 --> 01:33:20,759
谢谢
Thank you.

1018
01:33:23,686 --> 01:33:25,512
别多话
Oh, shut up.

1019
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:41,604
停下，罗恩，你又把这弄得满是雪花了
Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.

1020
01:35:46,078 --> 01:35:48,747
再跟我过一遍，我是怎么 跟拉文德分手的来着？
Tell me how I broke up with Lavender again.

1021
01:35:49,581 --> 01:35:52,417
呃，是这样…
Um, well...

1022
01:35:52,584 --> 01:35:55,585
她来医院看你
...she came to visit you in the hospital.

1023
01:35:56,463 --> 01:35:58,871
然后你说了些话
And you talked.

1024
01:36:00,467 --> 01:36:04,547
说的也不是太多了
I don't believe it was a particularly long conversation.

1025
01:36:04,722 --> 01:36:08,007
别误会，能甩了她我高兴还来不及
Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her.

1026
01:36:08,183 --> 01:36:10,509
只是她看起来，好像要发飙
It's just she seems a bit put out.

1027
01:36:17,026 --> 01:36:20,525
确实啊，不是吗？
Yes, she does, doesn't she?

1028
01:36:22,156 --> 01:36:27,197
那天晚上之后的事情 你什么都不记得了？
You say you don't remember anything from that night?

1029
01:36:27,369 --> 01:36:30,370
一点都不记得？
Anything at all?

1030
01:36:30,539 --> 01:36:32,366
是有一些些
There is something.

1031
01:36:35,878 --> 01:36:40,338
不过没可能了 那会我正晕着呢，对吧？
But it can't be. I was completely boggled, wasn't I?

1032
01:36:41,842 --> 01:36:45,045
是啊，晕着
Right. Boggled.

1033
01:36:52,311 --> 01:36:53,556
哈利
Harry.

1034
01:36:55,022 --> 01:36:56,184
凯蒂回来了
That's Katie.

1035
01:36:58,150 --> 01:36:59,775
凯蒂・贝尔
Katie Bell.

1036
01:37:07,451 --> 01:37:09,823
凯蒂，你感觉怎么样？
Katie. How are you?

1037
01:37:10,496 --> 01:37:14,992
我知道你会问，哈利 但我真不知道是谁对我下的咒
I know you're going to ask, Harry, but I don't know who cursed me.

1038
01:37:16,627 --> 01:37:20,162
我真的很努力想回忆
I've been trying to remember, honestly.

1039
01:37:20,589 --> 01:37:24,005
可就是记不起来
But I just can't.

1040
01:37:37,272 --> 01:37:38,601
凯蒂？
Katie?

1041
01:38:21,066 --> 01:38:25,146
我知道是你干的好事，马尔福 是你对她下咒，对不对？
I know what you did, Malfoy. You hexed her, didn't you?

1042
01:38:55,517 --> 01:38:57,510
神锋无影！
Sectumsempra!

1043
01:39:44,483 --> 01:39:47,400
速速复原
Vulnera Sanentur.

1044
01:39:49,071 --> 01:39:51,906
速速复原
Vulnera Sanentur.

1045
01:39:54,201 --> 01:39:57,072
速速复原
Vulnera Sanentur.

1046
01:40:18,183 --> 01:40:21,718
你今天就得扔了它
You have to get rid of it. Today.

1047
01:40:26,608 --> 01:40:28,233
牵着我的手
Take my hand.

1048
01:40:44,209 --> 01:40:46,119
有求必应屋
The Room of Requirement.

1049
01:40:52,593 --> 01:40:55,214
我们要把混血王子的这本书…
We need to hide the Half-Blood Prince's book...

1050
01:40:55,387 --> 01:40:59,088
藏在一个谁也找不到的地方 包括你自己
...where no one will ever find it, including you.

1051
01:41:07,441 --> 01:41:08,900
什么声音？
- What was that? - What was that?

1052
01:41:35,010 --> 01:41:36,339
瞧？
See?

1053
01:41:36,887 --> 01:41:38,927
这里到处都是惊喜
You never know what you'll find up here.

1054
01:41:58,075 --> 01:42:01,989
好了，闭上眼睛 这样你才不会被诱惑
All right, close your eyes. That way you can't be tempted.

1055
01:42:05,833 --> 01:42:07,541
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

1056
01:42:34,236 --> 01:42:37,107
要是你愿意，这个吻 也可以变成藏在这里的秘密
That can stay hidden up here too, if you like.

1057
01:42:51,754 --> 01:42:54,126
你和金妮干完事了？
So did you and Ginny do it, then?

1058
01:42:54,298 --> 01:42:55,460
干什么？
What?

1059
01:42:55,632 --> 01:42:57,709
藏书啊
You know, hide the book?

1060
01:42:57,885 --> 01:42:59,758
哦，对
Oh, yeah.

1061
01:43:02,681 --> 01:43:05,255
哦，天，忘了点东西
Ah. Dear, yes.

1062
01:43:05,434 --> 01:43:08,221
斯拉格霍恩那边还是运气不佳？
Still no luck with Slughorn, then, I take it?

1063
01:43:10,272 --> 01:43:11,601
运气
Luck.

1064
01:43:12,649 --> 01:43:15,983
对了，我就是需要点运气
That's it. All I need's a bit of luck.

1065
01:43:34,129 --> 01:43:37,332
你感觉怎样？
Well, how do you feel?

1066
01:43:37,508 --> 01:43:39,132
好极了！
Excellent.

1067
01:43:40,302 --> 01:43:42,295
真的，太棒了！
Really excellent.

1068
01:43:45,057 --> 01:43:46,635
记住…
Remember...

1069
01:43:46,975 --> 01:43:48,719
斯拉格霍恩通常很早吃晚饭
...Slughorn usually eats early...

1070
01:43:48,894 --> 01:43:51,895
然后会散个步，之后就回办公室
...takes a walk, and then returns to his office.

1071
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:53,558
嗯
Right.

1072
01:43:53,982 --> 01:43:56,141
- 我要去海格那 - 什么？
- I'm going down to Hagrid's. - What?

1073
01:43:56,318 --> 01:43:58,987
不行，哈利，你得去找斯拉格霍恩谈
No, Harry, you've got to go and speak to Slughorn.

1074
01:44:00,572 --> 01:44:03,146
- 我们都计划好了 - 我知道…
- We have a plan. - I know...

1075
01:44:03,325 --> 01:44:05,401
不过我觉得去海格那儿肯定有好事
...but I've got a good feeling about Hagrid's.

1076
01:44:05,577 --> 01:44:09,326
我觉得，我今晚就是该去那里 明白我的意思吗？
I feel it's the place to be tonight. Do you know what I mean?

1077
01:44:10,207 --> 01:44:12,449
- 不明白 - 好了，那就相信我吧，我知道自己在干什么
- No. - Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.

1078
01:44:12,626 --> 01:44:14,785
至少福灵剂知道
Or Felix does.

1079
01:44:48,037 --> 01:44:49,744
梅林的胡子啊，是你，哈利！
Merlin's beard, Harry!

1080
01:44:49,913 --> 01:44:54,042
抱歉，教授，我本来该提示下 清清嗓子，咳嗽咳嗽之类的
Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself. Cleared my throat, coughed.

1081
01:44:54,209 --> 01:44:56,167
您大概以为我是斯普劳特教授吧
You probably feared I was Professor Sprout.

1082
01:44:56,337 --> 01:44:59,752
还真是，你怎么会这么想？
Yes, I did, actually. What makes you think that?

1083
01:44:59,923 --> 01:45:01,999
看您的样子就知道了，教授
Well, just the general behavior, sir.

1084
01:45:02,176 --> 01:45:04,963
这么偷偷摸摸了 看到我还会吓一大跳了
The sneaking around, the jumping when you saw me.

1085
01:45:05,137 --> 01:45:08,720
这些是毒须草叶吗，教授？ 这些可是很珍贵的，对吧？
Are those Tentacula leaves, sir? They're very valuable, aren't they?

1086
01:45:08,891 --> 01:45:11,216
要是找对买家，一片叶子能卖十加隆
Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.

1087
01:45:11,393 --> 01:45:14,893
当然了，我对这种买卖根本不了解 只是听谣言罢了
Not that I'm familiar with any such transactions, but one does hear rumors.

1088
01:45:15,064 --> 01:45:18,848
我对这个的兴趣纯粹是学术性的
My own interests are purely academic, of course.

1089
01:45:19,026 --> 01:45:22,311
这些东西老是让我心里发毛
Personally, these plants always kind of freaked me out.

1090
01:45:25,574 --> 01:45:27,732
你怎么出城堡的，哈利？
How did you get out of the castle, Harry?

1091
01:45:27,910 --> 01:45:29,404
从大门出来的啊，教授
Through the front door, sir.

1092
01:45:29,578 --> 01:45:31,736
我去海格家，他是我的好朋友…
I'm off to Hagrid's. He's a very dear friend...

1093
01:45:31,914 --> 01:45:33,622
我这会想去拜访他一下
...and I fancied paying him a visit.

1094
01:45:33,791 --> 01:45:36,079
你要是不介意，我就先走了
So if you don't mind, I will be going now.

1095
01:45:36,877 --> 01:45:38,502
哈利！
Harry!

1096
01:45:39,338 --> 01:45:41,793
- 怎么了，教授？ - 这都快天黑了
- Sir? - It's nearly nightfall.

1097
01:45:41,965 --> 01:45:45,417
我不能让你一个人到处闲逛
Surely you realize I can't allow you to go roaming the grounds by yourself.

1098
01:45:45,594 --> 01:45:48,168
哦，这样啊，那您一起来吧
Well, then, by all means, come along, sir.

1099
01:45:53,519 --> 01:45:56,722
哈利，我坚持，你马上跟我
Harry, I must insist you accompany me...

1100
01:45:56,897 --> 01:45:58,640
回城堡去！
...back to the castle immediately!

1101
01:45:58,816 --> 01:46:02,066
那这一趟就白跑了，教授
That would be counterproductive, sir.

1102
01:46:03,404 --> 01:46:05,527
你这话什么意思？
And what makes you say that?

1103
01:46:06,615 --> 01:46:08,193
我也不知道
No idea.

1104
01:46:14,957 --> 01:46:16,368
霍拉斯
Horace.

1105
01:46:17,001 --> 01:46:22,291
梅林的胡子啊！这真是八眼巨蛛吗？
Merlin's beard. Is that an actual Acromantula?

1106
01:46:22,881 --> 01:46:24,957
我想是真的死蜘蛛，教授
A dead one, I think, sir.

1107
01:46:25,759 --> 01:46:27,301
我的天
Good God.

1108
01:46:27,928 --> 01:46:31,012
好家伙，你是怎么杀的它？
Dear fellow, however did you manage to kill it?

1109
01:46:31,306 --> 01:46:34,758
杀它？它可是我的老朋友
Kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.

1110
01:46:34,935 --> 01:46:39,147
- 抱歉，我不知道… - 别放心上，不止你一个人（不喜欢蜘蛛）
- I'm so sorry, I didn't... - Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.

1111
01:46:39,648 --> 01:46:43,100
蜘蛛这种生物，常常被人误解
Seriously misunderstood creatures, spiders are.

1112
01:46:43,277 --> 01:46:45,483
大概是因为眼睛吧，会让一些人害怕
It's the eyes, I reckon. They unnerve some folk.

1113
01:46:45,904 --> 01:46:47,862
还有那些长螯
Not to mention the pincers.

1114
01:46:52,161 --> 01:46:54,118
嗯，大概也是原因吧
Yeah, I reckon that too.

1115
01:46:54,830 --> 01:46:58,199
海格，我不想这个时候表现得铁石心肠
Hagrid, the last thing I wish to be is indelicate...

1116
01:46:58,375 --> 01:47:02,455
但八眼巨蛛的毒液可是相当稀罕
...but Acromantular venom is uncommonly rare.

1117
01:47:02,629 --> 01:47:04,836
能容我提取一两小瓶吗？
Would you allow me to extract a vial or two?

1118
01:47:05,007 --> 01:47:07,628
你也知道我，纯粹是用于学术研究
Purely for academic purposes, you understand.

1119
01:47:07,801 --> 01:47:10,719
反正它现在留着也没用了，不是吗？
Well, I don't suppose it's going to do him much good now, is it?

1120
01:47:10,888 --> 01:47:12,086
和我想的一模一样
My thoughts exactly.

1121
01:47:12,264 --> 01:47:18,765
我总是随身带几个安瓿瓶 就是为这种状况准备的
Always have a ampoule or two about my person for just such occasions as this.

1122
01:47:19,021 --> 01:47:24,015
魔药老师的老习惯了
Old Potions Master's habit, you know.

1123
01:47:24,693 --> 01:47:27,149
真希望你能见到它当年的样子
I wish you could've seen him in his prime.

1124
01:47:27,321 --> 01:47:30,986
雄伟极了，实在是雄伟极了
Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.

1125
01:47:32,409 --> 01:47:33,987
哦，天
Oh, dear.

1126
01:47:43,712 --> 01:47:46,915
- 你愿意让我说几句悼词吗？ - 好吧
- Would you like me to say a few words? - Yes.

1127
01:47:47,174 --> 01:47:48,716
我想，它有家人吧？
He had a family, I trust?

1128
01:47:48,884 --> 01:47:50,378
哦，那可不
Oh, yeah.

1129
01:47:55,724 --> 01:47:57,218
永别了…
Farewell...

1130
01:47:57,393 --> 01:47:59,266
阿拉贡
Aragog.

1131
01:48:03,774 --> 01:48:06,691
永别了，阿拉贡
Farewell, Aragog...

1132
01:48:07,069 --> 01:48:09,738
蜘蛛之王，阿拉贡
...king of the arachnids.

1133
01:48:10,572 --> 01:48:13,146
你的肉体或将腐朽
Your body will decay...

1134
01:48:14,410 --> 01:48:17,245
但你的灵魂必将永存
...but your spirit lingers on.

1135
01:48:17,955 --> 01:48:24,574
如此，你的人类朋友们 才会在经久的悲恸中寻得一丝宽慰
And your human friends find solace in the loss they have sustained.

1136
01:48:39,768 --> 01:48:43,386
我把它从一个蜘蛛蛋开始养大 刚出壳的时候还是个小不点
I had him from an egg, you know. Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

1137
01:48:43,564 --> 01:48:47,264
比只京巴狗大不了多少 你知道吧，京巴狗
No bigger than a Pekinese. A Pekinese, mind you.

1138
01:48:47,443 --> 01:48:52,603
真美好，我以前有一条鱼，叫弗兰西斯 跟我可亲了
How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis. He was very dear to me.

1139
01:48:52,781 --> 01:48:57,942
一天下午，我下楼一看，他就不见了
One afternoon I came downstairs, and he'd vanished.

1140
01:48:58,120 --> 01:48:59,698
“噗”，就不见了
Poof.

1141
01:48:59,872 --> 01:49:03,075
- 很奇怪啊，不是吗？ - 就是啊
- That's very odd, isn't it? - It is, isn't it?

1142
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:06,951
不过，我想这就是人生吧
But that's life, I suppose.

1143
01:49:07,129 --> 01:49:12,468
你过着过着，突然，噗！就没了
You go along and then suddenly, poof!

1144
01:49:12,634 --> 01:49:16,300
- 噗 - 噗
- Poof. - Poof.

1145
01:49:30,861 --> 01:49:33,981
是个学生送我弗兰西斯的
It was a student who gave me Francis.

1146
01:49:34,990 --> 01:49:39,284
一个春日的午后 我看到我桌上有一口小碗
One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl on my desk...

1147
01:49:40,204 --> 01:49:43,158
里面是浅浅的一汪清水
...with just a few inches of clear water in it.

1148
01:49:43,957 --> 01:49:47,492
水面上，漂着一朵花瓣
And floating on the surface was a flower petal.

1149
01:49:49,046 --> 01:49:51,501
我正看着，它却沉了下去
As I watched, it sank.

1150
01:49:53,008 --> 01:49:55,843
就在要碰到碗底的时候
Just before it reached the bottom...

1151
01:49:56,011 --> 01:49:57,470
它变形了
...it transformed...

1152
01:49:58,847 --> 01:50:00,674
变成了一条小鱼
...into a wee fish.

1153
01:50:02,351 --> 01:50:04,474
真是美妙
It was beautiful magic.

1154
01:50:05,479 --> 01:50:07,721
赏心悦目
Wondrous to behold.

1155
01:50:10,359 --> 01:50:13,111
那瓣花是百合
The flower petal had come from a lily.

1156
01:50:15,489 --> 01:50:16,520
和你母亲一样美
Your mother.

1157
01:50:18,575 --> 01:50:21,066
我下楼的那天
The day I came downstairs...

1158
01:50:22,037 --> 01:50:24,326
那碗空了的那天
...the day the bowl was empty...

1159
01:50:25,874 --> 01:50:28,033
也就是你母亲…
...was the day your mother...

1160
01:50:32,047 --> 01:50:34,040
我知道你为什么在这
I know why you're here.

1161
01:50:37,052 --> 01:50:39,045
但我帮不了你
But I can't help you.

1162
01:50:40,848 --> 01:50:42,556
帮你会毁了我自己
It would ruin me.

1163
01:50:46,270 --> 01:50:48,725
你知道我是怎么幸存下来的吗，教授？
Do you know why I survived, professor?

1164
01:50:49,273 --> 01:50:51,100
在我留下这疤的那天晚上
The night I got this?

1165
01:50:52,860 --> 01:50:54,484
是因为她
Because of her.

1166
01:50:55,404 --> 01:50:57,195
因为她牺牲了自己
Because she sacrificed herself.

1167
01:50:57,614 --> 01:50:59,987
因为她不愿为了活命离开我
Because she refused to step aside.

1168
01:51:00,159 --> 01:51:03,362
因为她的爱比伏地魔的法力更强大
Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.

1169
01:51:03,537 --> 01:51:07,238
- 别说他名字 - 我不怕说这个名字，教授
- Don't say his name. - I'm not afraid of the name, professor.

1170
01:51:08,083 --> 01:51:10,206
我告诉您一些事情吧
I'm going to tell you something.

1171
01:51:11,128 --> 01:51:14,082
一些别人只是猜测的事情
Something others have only guessed at.

1172
01:51:16,050 --> 01:51:17,544
传说是真的
It's true.

1173
01:51:18,135 --> 01:51:19,415
我是救世主
I am the Chosen One.

1174
01:51:20,429 --> 01:51:22,635
只有我能打败他，但是在这之前…
Only I can destroy him, but in order to do so...

1175
01:51:22,806 --> 01:51:26,092
我必须知道 汤姆・里德尔问了您什么问题
...I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you years ago in your office...

1176
01:51:26,268 --> 01:51:28,640
我必须知道，您告诉了他什么
...and I need to know what you told him.

1177
01:51:29,355 --> 01:51:31,762
勇敢些，教授
Be brave, professor.

1178
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:35,476
像我妈妈一样，勇敢些
Be brave like my mother.

1179
01:51:36,779 --> 01:51:39,448
否则，您只能给她蒙羞
Otherwise, you disgrace her.

1180
01:51:40,574 --> 01:51:42,863
否则，她的死毫无价值
Otherwise, she died for nothing.

1181
01:51:43,869 --> 01:51:49,076
否则，您心里的碗会永远空着
Otherwise, the bowl will remain empty forever.

1182
01:51:59,635 --> 01:52:02,755
请你，看完这个之后，不要看低我
Please, don't think badly of me when you see it.

1183
01:52:04,765 --> 01:52:08,051
即使在当时，你也没法想象他的强大
You've no idea what he was like, even then.

1184
01:52:44,805 --> 01:52:47,510
前几天晚上我在图书馆
I was in the library the other night...

1185
01:52:47,683 --> 01:52:49,841
禁书区
...in the Restricted Section...

1186
01:52:50,728 --> 01:52:54,346
我读到一些关于某种罕见魔法的材料
...and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic.

1187
01:52:55,649 --> 01:52:58,401
如果没记错，那东西叫…
It's called, as I understand it...

1188
01:52:59,695 --> 01:53:01,023
魂器
...a Horcrux.

1189
01:53:02,865 --> 01:53:05,616
- 你说什么？ - 魂器
- I beg your pardon? - Horcrux.

1190
01:53:06,035 --> 01:53:08,704
我看书的时候，看到这个词
I came across the term while reading...

1191
01:53:08,871 --> 01:53:11,872
但不是很懂
...and I didn't fully understand it.

1192
01:53:12,041 --> 01:53:13,784
汤姆，我不知道你在看的是什么书
I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom...

1193
01:53:13,959 --> 01:53:16,533
但这是非常黑暗邪恶的东西，非常邪恶
...but this is very dark stuff, very dark indeed.

1194
01:53:16,712 --> 01:53:18,254
正因此…
Which is...

1195
01:53:19,381 --> 01:53:21,208
我才来找您
...why I came to you.

1196
01:53:24,053 --> 01:53:29,676
魂器，是一种容器，隐藏着一个人的灵魂
A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.

1197
01:53:29,850 --> 01:53:32,471
但我想不出，怎么才办到的，教授
But I don't understand how that works, sir.

1198
01:53:35,064 --> 01:53:39,061
一个人把灵魂分裂出一部分 藏在一个容器里
One splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object.

1199
01:53:39,234 --> 01:53:42,853
这样，即使肉体遭到攻击甚至被毁 他仍被保护着
By doing so, you're protected, should you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1200
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:44,145
保护？
Protected?

1201
01:53:44,323 --> 01:53:47,526
那部分隐藏起来的灵魂会存活下去
That part of your soul that is hidden lives on.

1202
01:53:48,994 --> 01:53:51,402
换言之，就是长生不死
In other words, you cannot die.

1203
01:53:58,587 --> 01:54:01,754
那要怎么做才能分裂出灵魂，教授？
And how does one split his soul, sir?

1204
01:54:01,924 --> 01:54:04,711
我想，你已经知道答案了吧，汤姆
I think you already know the answer to that, Tom.

1205
01:54:05,928 --> 01:54:07,422
杀戮
Murder.

1206
01:54:07,930 --> 01:54:09,258
对
Yes.

1207
01:54:09,807 --> 01:54:14,718
杀戮会令灵魂分离 这是对自然法则的违背
Killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature.

1208
01:54:15,604 --> 01:54:20,349
你只能把灵魂分出来一次吗？ 比如，能不能分七次…？
Can you only split the soul once? For instance, isn't seven...?

1209
01:54:20,526 --> 01:54:22,020
七次？
Seven?

1210
01:54:22,778 --> 01:54:28,069
梅林的胡子啊，汤姆 难道杀一个人还不够可怕吗？
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough to consider killing one person?

1211
01:54:28,242 --> 01:54:31,990
要是把灵魂分成七份…
To rip the soul into seven pieces...

1212
01:54:33,163 --> 01:54:36,200
这些都只是假设，对吧，汤姆？ 纯粹是学术探讨？
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom? All academic?

1213
01:54:40,963 --> 01:54:42,291
那是自然，教授
Of course, sir.

1214
01:54:45,259 --> 01:54:47,251
就当这是我们之间的小秘密
It'll be our little secret.

1215
01:54:56,061 --> 01:54:57,306
教授
Sir.

1216
01:55:12,703 --> 01:55:14,826
比我想象的还要糟糕
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1217
01:55:14,997 --> 01:55:17,666
您是说，他成功了？ 他做出了一个魂器？
You mean to say he succeeded, sir, in making a Horcrux?

1218
01:55:17,833 --> 01:55:20,953
是的，他成功了，但不止是一个
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right. And not just once.

1219
01:55:21,128 --> 01:55:22,159
那些到底是什么东西？
What are they exactly?

1220
01:55:22,338 --> 01:55:25,671
什么都有可能，可能是最不起眼的物件
Could be anything. Most commonplace of objects.

1221
01:55:28,844 --> 01:55:30,552
比如，戒指
A ring, for example.

1222
01:55:31,180 --> 01:55:32,674
或者，笔记本
Or a book.

1223
01:55:33,974 --> 01:55:36,346
- 汤姆・里德尔的日记 - 没错，这就是一个魂器
- Tom Riddle's diary. - It's a Horcrux, yes.

1224
01:55:36,852 --> 01:55:38,975
四年前，你在密室救了金妮之后…
Four years ago, when you saved Ginny's life...

1225
01:55:39,146 --> 01:55:41,435
把这个带给我
...in the Chamber of Secrets, you brought me this.

1226
01:55:41,607 --> 01:55:43,516
我就知道这种魔法不一般
I knew this was a different kind of magic.

1227
01:55:43,692 --> 01:55:48,687
非常邪恶，非常强大 但直到今晚，我才知道它到底有多强大
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight I had no idea just how powerful.

1228
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:50,857
- 那这戒指？ - 是伏地魔母亲的
- The ring? - Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1229
01:55:51,241 --> 01:55:55,987
极难找到，但更难摧毁
Difficult to find. Even more difficult to destroy.

1230
01:55:56,163 --> 01:56:00,030
但是，如果谁能 把那些魂器全部找到并且销毁
But if you could find them all, if you did destroy each Horcrux...

1231
01:56:00,209 --> 01:56:01,371
谁就可能消灭伏地魔
One destroys Voldemort.

1232
01:56:01,543 --> 01:56:04,461
可怎么找呢？他可能把这些藏在任何地方
But how would you find them? They could be hidden anywhere.

1233
01:56:04,630 --> 01:56:07,880
没错，但魔法，尤其是黑魔法
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1234
01:56:21,855 --> 01:56:23,729
会留下踪迹
...leaves traces.

1235
01:56:31,532 --> 01:56:33,608
您这些天就是去这些地方 是不是，教授？
It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir?

1236
01:56:33,784 --> 01:56:36,073
- 就是您不在学校的时候？ - 对
- When you leave the school? - Yes.

1237
01:56:36,912 --> 01:56:39,996
我想，我可能又找到了一个
And I think perhaps I may have found another.

1238
01:56:40,165 --> 01:56:44,245
但这次，我没法一个人销毁它
But this time, I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1239
01:56:45,796 --> 01:56:50,458
哈利，我这次对你要求又太过分了
Once again, I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1240
01:56:54,430 --> 01:56:56,718
你有没有想过你的要求太过分了…
Have you ever considered that you ask too much...

1241
01:56:56,890 --> 01:56:59,512
你把太多事当成理所应当的了？
...that you take too much for granted?

1242
01:56:59,685 --> 01:57:04,726
你那智慧的大脑，有没有想过 我不想再继续做这件事了？
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore?

1243
01:57:04,898 --> 01:57:07,021
我有没有想过，与此事无关
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1244
01:57:07,901 --> 01:57:13,691
没有商量的余地了，西弗勒斯 你已经同意，没什么好谈的了
I will not negotiate with you, Severus. You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1245
01:57:32,092 --> 01:57:33,717
哦，哈利
Oh, Harry.

1246
01:57:36,305 --> 01:57:38,630
你该刮刮胡子了，朋友
You need a shave, my friend.

1247
01:57:41,435 --> 01:57:45,646
知道嘛，有时候 我都忘了你成长了这么多
You know, at times, I forget how much you've grown.

1248
01:57:45,814 --> 01:57:49,764
有时候，我还是能看到 那个壁橱里的小男孩
At times, I still see the small boy from the cupboard.

1249
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:53,692
原谅我这番无病呻吟，哈利
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1250
01:57:54,156 --> 01:57:55,650
我是个老头了
I'm an old man.

1251
01:57:55,824 --> 01:57:57,484
在我看来您一点没变，教授
You still look the same to me, sir.

1252
01:57:58,952 --> 01:58:01,953
你和你母亲一样，总是这么好心肠
Just like your mother, you're unfailingly kind.

1253
01:58:02,122 --> 01:58:05,325
恐怕，没人会忽视这一点
A trait people never fail to undervalue, I'm afraid.

1254
01:58:08,087 --> 01:58:12,583
我们今晚要去的地方，极度凶险
The place to which we journey tonight is extremely dangerous.

1255
01:58:12,758 --> 01:58:16,257
我答应过你，让你随我去 我不会食言
I promised you could accompany me, and I stand by that promise.

1256
01:58:16,428 --> 01:58:18,255
但有一个条件
But there is one condition:

1257
01:58:18,430 --> 01:58:21,633
你必须毫不犹豫得执行我所有指示
You must obey every command I give you, without question.

1258
01:58:22,518 --> 01:58:24,142
好的，教授
Yes, sir.

1259
01:58:24,311 --> 01:58:26,434
你明白我的意思吧？
You do understand what I'm saying?

1260
01:58:27,022 --> 01:58:29,513
我若是让你躲，你就躲
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1261
01:58:29,692 --> 01:58:32,017
我若是让你跑，你就跑
Should I tell you to run, you run.

1262
01:58:32,194 --> 01:58:36,192
我若是让你别管我，救自己，你也必须照做
Should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself, you must do so.

1263
01:58:41,370 --> 01:58:42,947
我要你保证，哈利
Your word, Harry.

1264
01:58:44,581 --> 01:58:46,076
我保证
My word.

1265
01:58:46,875 --> 01:58:48,535
扶着我手臂
Take my arm.

1266
01:58:49,962 --> 01:58:52,369
教授，我们在霍格沃兹内 好像不能幻影移形吧？
Sir, I thought you couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts.

1267
01:58:53,048 --> 01:58:56,500
呵呵，当校长自然有当校长的好处
Well, being me has its privileges.

1268
01:59:43,766 --> 01:59:45,390
就是这儿了
This is the place.

1269
01:59:46,185 --> 01:59:47,762
错不了
Oh, yes.

1270
01:59:48,687 --> 01:59:51,261
有人在这里施过魔法
This place has known magic.

1271
01:59:59,281 --> 02:00:00,823
- 教授！ - 要想找到入口
- Sir! - In order to gain passage...

1272
02:00:00,991 --> 02:00:02,402
必须付出代价
...payment must be made.

1273
02:00:02,576 --> 02:00:06,194
一个能削弱来者实力的代价
Payment intended to weaken any intruder.

1274
02:00:07,790 --> 02:00:09,616
- 您该让我来，教授 - 不行，哈利
- You should've let me, sir. - No, Harry.

1275
02:00:10,084 --> 02:00:12,788
你的血比我的珍贵太多了
Your blood's much more precious than mine.

1276
02:00:34,692 --> 02:00:39,318
伏地魔不会轻易让人发现 他隐藏灵魂的地方
Voldemort will not have made it easy to discover his hiding place.

1277
02:00:39,488 --> 02:00:42,822
他一定会布下防范
He will have put certain defenses in position.

1278
02:00:45,411 --> 02:00:46,821
小心
Careful.

1279
02:01:10,352 --> 02:01:11,467
就是那儿了
There it is.

1280
02:01:12,980 --> 02:01:15,685
问题是，我们怎么过去？
The only question is, how do we get there?

1281
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:39,707
劳驾帮个忙，哈利
If you would, Harry.

1282
02:02:27,012 --> 02:02:29,420
您认为魂器就在这里吗？
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?

1283
02:02:30,057 --> 02:02:31,432
嗯，没错
Oh, yes.

1284
02:02:42,528 --> 02:02:44,105
必须喝光这些液体
It has to be drunk.

1285
02:02:44,279 --> 02:02:47,115
一点不剩
All of it has to be drunk.

1286
02:02:47,950 --> 02:02:51,283
你还记得，我带你来之前 说的那个条件吗？
You remember the conditions on which I brought you with me?

1287
02:02:51,453 --> 02:02:53,861
这些液体，或许会让我失去行动能力
This potion might paralyze me.

1288
02:02:54,289 --> 02:02:55,949
或许会让我忘记我来这里的目的
Might make me forget why I'm here.

1289
02:02:56,750 --> 02:03:00,036
或许会让我无比痛苦 痛苦到令我向你哀求
Might cause me so much pain that I beg for relief.

1290
02:03:00,295 --> 02:03:02,205
但你不要理会我的任何要求
You are not to indulge these requests.

1291
02:03:02,381 --> 02:03:05,916
这是你的使命，哈利 确保我喝光这些液体
It's your job, Harry, to make sure I keep drinking this potion.

1292
02:03:06,093 --> 02:03:08,549
就算是要逼着我下咽，你也要做
Even if you have to force it down my throat.

1293
02:03:09,013 --> 02:03:11,135
- 明白了吗？ - 可是教授，为什么不让我喝？
- Understood? - Why can't I drink it, sir?

1294
02:03:11,306 --> 02:03:16,728
因为我比你老，比你聪明 而你比我珍贵太多
Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable.

1295
02:03:20,649 --> 02:03:22,725
祝你健康，哈利
Your good health, Harry.

1296
02:03:38,876 --> 02:03:40,156
教授
Professor.

1297
02:03:42,296 --> 02:03:43,494
教授！
Professor!

1298
02:03:50,179 --> 02:03:51,673
哈利
Harry.

1299
02:03:51,847 --> 02:03:54,338
教授，你听得到我吗？
Professor, can you hear me?

1300
02:03:55,642 --> 02:03:56,805
教授
Professor.

1301
02:04:12,242 --> 02:04:13,357
别，不要
No. Don't.

1302
02:04:13,535 --> 02:04:15,861
您一定要继续喝，您自己说的，记得吗？
You have to keep drinking, like you said. Remember?

1303
02:04:25,130 --> 02:04:27,004
- 停下 - 会停下的，会停下的
- Stop. - It will stop. It will stop...

1304
02:04:27,174 --> 02:04:31,587
- 但您得先继续喝 - 求你，别逼我
...but only if you keep drinking. - Please, don't make me.

1305
02:04:31,762 --> 02:04:33,885
- 对不起，教授 - 求求你
- I'm sorry, sir. - Please.

1306
02:04:34,056 --> 02:04:36,345
杀了我吧，杀了我吧！
- Kill me. Kill me! - No!

1307
02:04:38,268 --> 02:04:39,348
是我的错
It's my fault.

1308
02:04:41,021 --> 02:04:42,219
都是我的错
It's all my fault.

1309
02:04:44,066 --> 02:04:45,690
是我的错
It's my fault.

1310
02:04:45,859 --> 02:04:49,228
再喝一杯，教授，就一杯 喝完之后，我保证
Just one more, sir. One more, and then I promise...

1311
02:04:49,905 --> 02:04:52,230
我保证，您说什么我都会去做
...I promise I'll do what you say.

1312
02:04:52,408 --> 02:04:54,234
- 我保证 - 不要
- I promise. - No.

1313
02:04:55,285 --> 02:04:56,661
求您了
Please.

1314
02:05:20,811 --> 02:05:22,270
哈利
Harry.

1315
02:05:29,403 --> 02:05:30,434
水
Water.

1316
02:05:31,447 --> 02:05:32,561
水
Water.

1317
02:05:32,740 --> 02:05:34,531
水
Water.

1318
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:42,831
您成功了，教授
You did it, sir.

1319
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,459
您看
Look.

1320
02:05:46,462 --> 02:05:47,707
哈利
Harry.

1321
02:05:49,089 --> 02:05:50,418
水
Water.

1322
02:05:52,176 --> 02:05:53,836
清水如泉
Aguamenti.

1323
02:05:54,053 --> 02:05:55,511
水
Water.

1324
02:06:31,674 --> 02:06:33,049
荧光闪烁
Lumos.

1325
02:07:01,495 --> 02:07:03,404
球状荧光！
Lumos Maxima!

1326
02:07:12,881 --> 02:07:14,708
哈利
Harry.

1327
02:07:18,762 --> 02:07:19,877
神锋无影！
Sectumsempra!

1328
02:07:20,055 --> 02:07:21,218
哈利
Harry.

1329
02:07:22,182 --> 02:07:23,807
- 昏昏倒地！ - 哈利
- Stupefy! - Harry.

1330
02:08:22,993 --> 02:08:24,274
哈利
Harry.

1331
02:08:28,290 --> 02:08:30,615
烈火熊熊！
Partis Temporus!

1332
02:09:13,168 --> 02:09:16,288
都回自己的学院去，别闲逛
Go to your houses. No dawdling.

1333
02:09:57,129 --> 02:10:00,830
我们得去校医院，教授 去找庞弗雷夫人
We need to get you to the hospital wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.

1334
02:10:03,260 --> 02:10:04,635
不
No.

1335
02:10:05,679 --> 02:10:08,349
西弗勒斯，我需要西弗勒斯
Severus. Severus is who I need.

1336
02:10:08,515 --> 02:10:12,050
去叫醒他，告诉他发生了什么
Wake him. Tell him what happened.

1337
02:10:12,227 --> 02:10:13,887
别跟其他人提起
Speak to no one else.

1338
02:10:14,521 --> 02:10:16,728
找西弗勒斯，哈利
Severus, Harry.

1339
02:10:22,029 --> 02:10:24,436
快躲到楼下，哈利
Hide yourself below, Harry.

1340
02:10:25,908 --> 02:10:28,909
没我允许，不要出声 也不要被别人看到
Don't speak or be seen by anybody without my permission.

1341
02:10:29,078 --> 02:10:32,862
无论发生了什么，都要记得 在下面躲好
Whatever happens, it's imperative you stay below.

1342
02:10:33,665 --> 02:10:35,325
哈利，照我说的做
Harry, do as I say.

1343
02:10:38,962 --> 02:10:40,243
相信我
Trust me.

1344
02:10:42,007 --> 02:10:43,466
相信我
Trust me.

1345
02:11:04,029 --> 02:11:05,856
晚安啊，德拉科
Good evening, Draco.

1346
02:11:06,740 --> 02:11:10,275
晚上天气这么好 你来这儿做什么啊？
What brings you here on this fine spring evening?

1347
02:11:10,452 --> 02:11:12,196
还有谁在这？我听到你和人说话了
Who else is here? I heard you talking.

1348
02:11:12,371 --> 02:11:16,451
我常常一个人自言自语 这习惯可相当有益
I often talk aloud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful.

1349
02:11:18,585 --> 02:11:21,421
你会自言自语吗，德拉科？
Have you been whispering to yourself, Draco?

1350
02:11:23,924 --> 02:11:25,383
德拉科…
Draco...

1351
02:11:26,051 --> 02:11:29,005
- 你不会杀人的 - 你怎么知道我会什么不会什么？
...you are no assassin. - How do you know what I am?

1352
02:11:29,179 --> 02:11:30,971
我做过很多事，说出来吓死你
I've done things that would shock you.

1353
02:11:31,140 --> 02:11:35,268
给凯蒂・贝尔下咒，想让她把项链送给我？
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?

1354
02:11:35,436 --> 02:11:38,057
偷换了瓶掺了毒物的蜜酒？ 诸如此类的事情？
Replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison?

1355
02:11:38,230 --> 02:11:39,808
恕我直言，德拉科
Forgive me, Draco.

1356
02:11:39,982 --> 02:11:42,473
你的这些尝试太不用心了
I cannot help feeling these actions are so weak...

1357
02:11:42,651 --> 02:11:45,023
说明你的心思完全没有放在这里
...your heart can't really have been in them.

1358
02:11:45,195 --> 02:11:48,399
他信任我，我被选中了
He trusts me. I was chosen.

1359
02:11:52,202 --> 02:11:53,994
那，我就成全你吧
Then I shall make it easy for you.

1360
02:11:54,163 --> 02:11:55,823
除你武器！
Expelliarmus!

1361
02:11:59,168 --> 02:12:01,493
很好，很好
Very good. Very good.

1362
02:12:03,255 --> 02:12:04,714
你不是一个人在这
You're not alone.

1363
02:12:05,799 --> 02:12:06,831
还有其他人
There are others.

1364
02:12:08,886 --> 02:12:10,297
怎么办到的？
How?

1365
02:12:11,597 --> 02:12:14,266
有求必应屋里的消失柜
The vanishing cabinet in the Room of Requirement.

1366
02:12:15,017 --> 02:12:17,389
- 我一直在修理它 - 我猜猜看
- I've been mending it. - Let me guess.

1367
02:12:17,561 --> 02:12:20,515
它还有个姐妹柜，双子柜
It has a sister. A twin.

1368
02:12:20,689 --> 02:12:22,896
放在博金-博克，两个形成了一条通道
In Borgin and Burkes. They form a passage.

1369
02:12:23,067 --> 02:12:24,858
真天才
Ingenious.

1370
02:12:25,527 --> 02:12:26,772
德拉科
Draco...

1371
02:12:26,945 --> 02:12:33,031
很多年前，我认识的一个孩子 他人生的每一个抉择都做错了
...years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices.

1372
02:12:33,952 --> 02:12:36,870
- 如今，让我帮你一次吧 - 我不用你帮！
- Please let me help you. - I don't want your help!

1373
02:12:37,664 --> 02:12:41,164
你还不明白吗？我必须这么做
Don't you understand? I have to do this.

1374
02:12:42,378 --> 02:12:44,038
我必须杀了你
I have to kill you.

1375
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:46,711
要不然他就会杀我
Or he's gonna kill me.

1376
02:12:56,225 --> 02:12:59,843
瞧我们逮着谁了
Well, look what we have here.

1377
02:13:01,730 --> 02:13:03,889
干得好，德拉科
Well done, Draco.

1378
02:13:07,569 --> 02:13:09,396
晚上好啊，贝拉特里克斯
Good evening, Bellatrix.

1379
02:13:10,447 --> 02:13:12,606
我看你该给我介绍一下这几位吧？
I think introductions are in order, don't you?

1380
02:13:12,783 --> 02:13:17,908
我也想，阿不思，可惜今天时间有点紧
Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid we're all on a bit of a tight schedule.

1381
02:13:18,539 --> 02:13:19,914
动手
Do it.

1382
02:13:21,208 --> 02:13:25,336
他根本没那胆子，跟他爹一样
He doesn't have the stomach, just like his father.

1383
02:13:25,754 --> 02:13:27,248
还是用我的办法来吧
Let me finish him in my own way.

1384
02:13:27,423 --> 02:13:31,041
不！黑魔王的命令很明白 必须让马尔福下手
No! The Dark Lord was clear, the boy is to do it.

1385
02:13:31,218 --> 02:13:33,258
这是你荣耀，快动手
This is your moment. Do it.

1386
02:13:34,805 --> 02:13:36,798
快啊，德拉科
Go on, Draco.

1387
02:13:36,974 --> 02:13:39,132
就现在！
Now!

1388
02:13:40,394 --> 02:13:41,722
不
No.

1389
02:13:53,615 --> 02:13:55,158
西弗勒斯
Severus.

1390
02:14:04,168 --> 02:14:05,626
求求你…
Please.

1391
02:14:06,628 --> 02:14:07,957
阿瓦达索命
Avada Kedavra.

1392
02:15:12,361 --> 02:15:15,812
海格！你躲哪了？
Hagrid! Hello?

1393
02:15:15,989 --> 02:15:20,034
斯内普！他信任你！
Snape! He trusted you!

1394
02:15:24,373 --> 02:15:25,997
你们走
Go on.

1395
02:15:26,667 --> 02:15:28,375
速速禁锢
Incarcerous.

1396
02:15:28,544 --> 02:15:31,213
还手啊！你这懦夫，还手！
Fight back! You coward, fight back!

1397
02:15:32,840 --> 02:15:36,043
不！他是黑魔王的猎物
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord.

1398
02:15:56,196 --> 02:15:57,572
神锋无影！
Sectumsempra!

1399
02:16:06,040 --> 02:16:11,282
你竟敢拿我发明的魔咒来对付我，波特？
You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?

1400
02:16:12,046 --> 02:16:13,208
没错
Yes.

1401
02:16:13,922 --> 02:16:18,086
我就是混血王子
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.

1402
02:20:06,155 --> 02:20:07,613
波特
McGONAGALL: Potter...

1403
02:20:08,323 --> 02:20:10,815
刚才发生的那些事
...in light of what has happened...

1404
02:20:12,244 --> 02:20:15,530
你应该找人谈谈
...if you should have the need to talk to someone...

1405
02:20:17,499 --> 02:20:21,497
你该知道，邓不利多教授
You should know, Professor Dumbledore...

1406
02:20:23,339 --> 02:20:25,794
你对他来说，很重要
...you meant a great deal to him.

1407
02:20:44,068 --> 02:20:46,226
你觉得他下得了手吗？
Do you think he would've done it?

1408
02:20:46,403 --> 02:20:48,277
德拉科？
Draco?

1409
02:20:49,365 --> 02:20:50,693
不会
No.

1410
02:20:51,867 --> 02:20:53,907
不会，他已经准备放下魔杖了
No, he was lowering his wand.

1411
02:20:54,953 --> 02:20:56,911
到头来，还是斯内普
In the end, it was Snape.

1412
02:20:57,539 --> 02:20:59,995
总是斯内普
It was always Snape.

1413
02:21:00,167 --> 02:21:02,373
而我却什么也做不成
And I did nothing.

1414
02:21:09,051 --> 02:21:10,462
这个是假的
It's fake.

1415
02:21:12,054 --> 02:21:13,382
打开吧
Open it.

1416
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:28,397
“致黑魔王：我知道 你读到这封信时，我早已死了
"To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead long before you read this...

1417
02:21:28,570 --> 02:21:32,236
但我想让你知道，是我 发现了你的秘密
...but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret.

1418
02:21:33,242 --> 02:21:37,109
我拿走了真的魂器，并将尽快销毁
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.

1419
02:21:37,287 --> 02:21:40,324
我以死为代价，希望当你遇到敌手时
I face death in the hope that when you meet your match...

1420
02:21:40,499 --> 02:21:42,741
你会是个血肉之躯的凡人
...you will be mortal once more.

1421
02:21:44,044 --> 02:21:45,704
R.A.B”
R.A.B."

1422
02:21:46,964 --> 02:21:48,423
R.A.B
R.A.B.

1423
02:21:48,799 --> 02:21:50,079
不知道是谁
Don't know.

1424
02:21:52,094 --> 02:21:54,763
但不管他们是谁，真的魂器在他们手上
But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux.

1425
02:21:55,723 --> 02:21:57,265
我们做的这一切，都是枉然
Which means it was all a waste.

1426
02:21:58,600 --> 02:22:00,095
一切的一切
All of it.

1427
02:22:06,316 --> 02:22:08,393
罗恩不介意了
Ron's okay with it, you know.

1428
02:22:08,902 --> 02:22:10,397
关于你跟金妮的事
You and Ginny.

1429
02:22:11,030 --> 02:22:14,730
不过我要是你，有他在场的时候 还是能少亲就少亲
But if I were you, when he's around, I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.

1430
02:22:16,076 --> 02:22:18,069
我不会回来了，赫敏
I'm not coming back, Hermione.

1431
02:22:19,246 --> 02:22:21,951
无论邓不利多开始的是什么使命 我都要去完成它
I've got to finish whatever Dumbledore started.

1432
02:22:22,124 --> 02:22:24,959
我也不知道这条路会引我去向何方
And I don't know where that'll lead me...

1433
02:22:25,127 --> 02:22:28,745
但如果可能，我会让你和罗恩 知道我到了什么地方
...but I'll let you and Ron know where I am when I can.

1434
02:22:30,090 --> 02:22:32,712
我一直很佩服你的勇气，哈利
I've always admired your courage, Harry.

1435
02:22:32,885 --> 02:22:35,554
但有时候，你也太傻气了
But sometimes, you can be really thick.

1436
02:22:38,599 --> 02:22:40,841
你不会真以为靠你一个人
You don't really think you're going to be able...

1437
02:22:41,018 --> 02:22:43,390
就能找到所有魂器吧？
...to find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you?

1438
02:22:47,649 --> 02:22:49,309
你需要我们，哈利
You need us, Harry.

1439
02:23:05,125 --> 02:23:08,210
我从没注意过，原来这里的风景这么美
I never realized how beautiful this place was.
