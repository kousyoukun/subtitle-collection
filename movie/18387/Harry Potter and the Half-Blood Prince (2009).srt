I would think you would want to

get an "Outstanding" in my O .W.L.

was teaching Potions.

-Yes, Miss...?
-Granger, sir.

377

That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.

378
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,952
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

379
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,249
It's terribly tricky to make.

380
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,460
And this is Amortentia...

381
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,046
...the most powerful
love potion in the world.

382
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:13,800
It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

383
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,095
For example, I smell...

384
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:21,892
...freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...

385
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,395
...spearmint toothpaste.

386
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:30,275
SLUGHORN: Now, Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.

387
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:35,447
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

388
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:42,287
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

389
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,629
Sir? You haven't told us
what's in that one.

known as Felix Felicis.

-liquid luck.
-Yes, Miss Granger. liquid luck.

395
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,692
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.

396

One sip and you will find
that all of your endeavors succeed.

No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.

No, really.

all over my sister, wasn't he?

because me dad says potions are rubbish.

You were his teacher.

Now, get out of here at once, and don't
let me ever catch you mentioning it again!

I'd be surprised if you weren't.

940
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:37,928
Well, I don't understand.
What happened?

941
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:41,765
This is perhaps the most important
memory I've collected.

942
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,851
It is also a lie.

943
01:23:44,769 --> 01:23:46,562
This memory has been tampered with...

944
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:51,108
...by the same person whose memory it is,
our old friend, Professor Slughorn.

945
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,736
But why would he tamper
with his own memory?

946
01:23:53,903 --> 01:23:56,780
-I suspect he's ashamed of it.
-Why?

947
01:23:56,948 --> 01:23:58,449
Why, indeed?

948
01:23:59,242 --> 01:24:02,619
I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.

949

Now I want you to persuade him
to divulge his true memory...

To what do I owe this pleasure?

963
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:04,598
Sir, I wondered
if I might ask you something.

964

Ask away, dear boy, ask away.

965
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:10,187
The other day I was in the library,
in the Restricted Section...

966
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:14,024
...and I came across something rather odd
about a very rare piece of magic.

967
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,028
Yes. And what was this
rare piece of magic?

968
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:21,532
Well, I don't know.
I can't remember the name exactly.

969
01:25:21,699 --> 01:25:26,036
It got me wondering, are there some kinds
of magic you're not allowed to teach us?

better be posed to Professor Snape .

...well, he's not like you.

976
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:44,221
He might misunderstand.

977
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:49,351
Yes. There can be no light
without the dark.

978
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:53,564
And so it is with magic. Myself, I always
strive to live within the light.

will remain empty forever.

Please, don't think badly of me
when you see it.

1248
01:52:04,759 --> 01:52:08,053

even then.

1249
01:52:44,799 --> 01:52:47,509
RIDDLE:
I was in the library the other night...

1250
01:52:47,677 --> 01:52:49,845
...in the Restricted Section...

1251
01:52:50,722 --> 01:52:54,349
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

1252
01:52:55,643 --> 01:52:58,395
It's called, as I understand it...

1253
01:52:59,689 --> 01:53:01,023
...a Horcrux.

1254
01:53:02,859 --> 01:53:05,611
-I beg your pardon?
-Horcrux.

1255
01:53:06,029 --> 01:53:08,697
I came across the term while reading...

1256
01:53:08,865 --> 01:53:11,867
...and I didn't fully understand it.

1257
01:53:12,035 --> 01:53:16,538
I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom,
but this is very dark stuff, very dark indeed.

1258
01:53:16,706 --> 01:53:18,248
Which is...

1259
01:53:19,375 --> 01:53:21,210
...why I came to you.

1260
01:53:24,047 --> 01:53:29,676
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

1261
01:53:29,844 --> 01:53:32,471
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

1262
01:53:35,058 --> 01:53:39,061
One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

1263
01:53:39,229 --> 01:53:42,856
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1264
01:53:43,024 --> 01:53:44,149
Protected?

1265
01:53:44,317 --> 01:53:47,528
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

1266
01:53:48,988 --> 01:53:51,406
In other words, you cannot die.

1267
01:53:58,581 --> 01:54:01,750
And how does one split his soul, sir?

1268
01:54:01,918 --> 01:54:04,711
SLUGHORN: I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.

1269
01:54:05,922 --> 01:54:07,422
Murder.

1270
01:54:07,924 --> 01:54:09,258
Yes.

1271
01:54:09,801 --> 01:54:14,721
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

1272
01:54:15,598 --> 01:54:20,352
RIDDLE: Can you only split the soul once?
For instance, isn't seven...?

1273
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:22,020
Seven?

1274
01:54:22,772 --> 01:54:28,068
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

1275
01:54:28,236 --> 01:54:31,989
To rip the soul into seven pieces... .

1276
01:54:33,157 --> 01:54:36,201
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All academic?

1277
01:54:40,957 --> 01:54:42,291
Of course, sir.

1278
01:54:45,253 --> 01:54:47,254
It'll be our little secret.

1279
01:54:56,055 --> 01:54:57,306
HARRY:
Sir.

1280
01:55:12,697 --> 01:55:14,823
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1281
01:55:14,991 --> 01:55:17,659
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?

1282
01:55:17,827 --> 01:55:20,954
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

1283
01:55:21,122 --> 01:55:22,164
What are they exactly?

1284
01:55:22,332 --> 01:55:25,667
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

1285
01:55:28,838 --> 01:55:30,547
A ring, for example.

1286
01:55:31,174 --> 01:55:32,674
Or a book.

1287
01:55:33,968 --> 01:55:36,345
-Tom Riddle's diary.
-It's a Horcrux, yes.

1288
01:55:36,846 --> 01:55:38,972
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

1289
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:41,433
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1290
01:55:41,601 --> 01:55:43,518
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1291
01:55:43,686 --> 01:55:48,690
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

1292
01:55:48,858 --> 01:55:50,859
-The ring?
-Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1293
01:55:51,235 --> 01:55:55,989
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1294
01:55:56,157 --> 01:55:59,735
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux....

1295
01:55:59,803 --> 01:56:01,370
One destroys Voldemort.

1296
01:56:01,537 --> 01:56:04,456
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.

1297
01:56:04,624 --> 01:56:07,876
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1298
01:56:21,849 --> 01:56:23,725
...leaves traces.

1299
01:56:31,526 --> 01:56:33,610
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?

1300
01:56:33,778 --> 01:56:36,071
-When you leave the school?
-Yes.

1301
01:56:36,906 --> 01:56:39,992
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

1302
01:56:40,159 --> 01:56:44,246
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1303
01:56:45,790 --> 01:56:50,460
Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1304
01:56:54,424 --> 01:56:56,717
SNAPE: Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

1305
01:56:56,884 --> 01:56:59,511
...that you take too much for granted?

1306
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:04,725
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?

1307
01:57:04,892 --> 01:57:07,019
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1308
01:57:07,895 --> 01:57:13,692
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1309
01:57:32,086 --> 01:57:33,712
Oh, Harry.

1310
01:57:36,299 --> 01:57:38,633
You need a shave, my friend.

1311
01:57:41,429 --> 01:57:45,640
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1312
01:57:45,808 --> 01:57:49,770
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

1313
01:57:51,314 --> 01:57:53,690
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1314
01:57:54,150 --> 01:57:55,650
I'm an old man.

1315
01:57:55,818 --> 01:57:57,486
You still look the same to me, sir.

1316
01:57:58,946 --> 01:58:01,948
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

1317
01:58:02,116 --> 01:58:05,327
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

1318
01:58:08,081 --> 01:58:12,584
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1319
01:58:12,752 --> 01:58:16,254
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

1320
01:58:16,422 --> 01:58:18,256
But there is one condition:

1321
01:58:18,424 --> 01:58:21,635
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

1322
01:58:22,512 --> 01:58:24,137
Yes, sir.

1323
01:58:24,305 --> 01:58:26,431
You do understand what I'm saying?

1324
01:58:27,016 --> 01:58:29,518
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1325

Should I tell you to run, you run.

1326
01:58:32,188 --> 01:58:36,191
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

1327
01:58:41,364 --> 01:58:42,948

Apparate within Hogwarts.

...payment must be made.

Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1338

-You should've let me, sir.
-No, Harry.

than mine.

1340
02:00:34,685 --> 02:00:39,314
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1341
02:00:39,482 --> 02:00:42,817
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

1342
02:00:45,404 --> 02:00:46,821
Careful.

1343

Oh, yes.

1348
02:02:42,521 --> 02:02:44,105
It has to be drunk.

I brought you with me?

1351

This potion might paralyze me.

1352
02:02:54,283 --> 02:02:55,950
Might make me forget why I'm here.

1353
02:02:56,744 --> 02:03:00,038
Might cause me so much pain
that I beg for relief.

You are not to indulge these requests.

I keep drinking this potion.

-Why can't I drink it, sir?
