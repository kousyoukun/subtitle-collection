1
00:04:59,523 --> 00:05:00,649
Remember, Highlander.

2
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:16,062
Remember?

3
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:08,019
Free men of the planet,
hear me.

4
00:06:08,123 --> 00:06:11,614
We gather together
in secret for the last time,

5
00:06:11,724 --> 00:06:13,955
you suffer under the yoke
of General Katana's rule

6
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:15,892
for the last time,

7
00:06:15,996 --> 00:06:19,261
and you stand without a leader
for the last time.

8
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:20,798
Will you lead us,
Ramirez?

9
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:22,959
No. I'm not your leader.

10
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:27,664
But because I see
with eyes different from yours,

11
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:31,765
I see a man
with a great destiny before him.

12
00:06:31,877 --> 00:06:34,744
Who is he?
Show him to us!

13
00:06:34,847 --> 00:06:35,974
Let him show himself.

14
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:56,756
Yes. You.

15
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:28,759
We are now... as one.

16
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,232
How do we start?

17
00:07:34,335 --> 00:07:38,239
Not we. You...
And you start with Katana.

18
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,908
General Katana's attacking!

19
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:11,762
Remember the rebellion?

20
00:08:11,873 --> 00:08:14,706
The cause is still just...
and still yours.

21
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:29,421
Break ranks!
Get more men!

22
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:33,942
My friends in here remind me

23
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:36,382
of you and Ramirez,

24
00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:39,318
so deadly in their
own environment, yet...

25
00:09:43,158 --> 00:09:46,651
Ha! So tame and servile in mine.

26
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,324
Maybe they're just waiting.

27
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,867
Waiting for what?

28
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,029
For you to get careless.

29
00:09:58,675 --> 00:09:59,799
Maybe they are.

30
00:10:02,377 --> 00:10:04,471
But as of tomorrow,

31
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:06,569
waiting won't be
an option for you, will it?

32
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:07,842
You sure?

33
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:51,384
Let's get on with it.

34
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,618
The punishment for rebellion is death.

35
00:10:54,727 --> 00:10:56,626
Judge them guilty,
and I'll execute them here

36
00:10:56,729 --> 00:10:58,219
now.

37
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,993
You forget yourself, General Katana.

38
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:04,262
As you well know, for many years

39
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,735
we have exiled
those rebels and criminals

40
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,935
who, like you,
possess this unholy immortality.

41
00:11:11,043 --> 00:11:12,533
Therefore, I sentence you both

42
00:11:12,642 --> 00:11:14,440
to the same exile...

43
00:11:14,545 --> 00:11:16,207
An exile into the future.

44
00:11:16,315 --> 00:11:18,179
What?

45
00:11:18,281 --> 00:11:19,908
Silence, General Katana!

46
00:11:20,017 --> 00:11:24,477
In that distant future, you will face
other immortals in trial by combat

47
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:26,647
from which only one can survive.

48
00:11:26,757 --> 00:11:29,487
And, as is your way, you will die

49
00:11:29,593 --> 00:11:32,118
only when your head
is cut from your body.

50
00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:33,958
Will we be together?

51
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:35,463
Well, not at first,

52
00:11:35,565 --> 00:11:39,022
but we are joined in a way
that can never be broken,

53
00:11:39,137 --> 00:11:41,366
not even by death.

54
00:11:41,471 --> 00:11:43,062
When you need me,

55
00:11:43,173 --> 00:11:45,334
you'll only have to call my name.

56
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,272
I'll always find you.

57
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:52,075
Finally, the last one to survive
will have a choice.

58
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:53,705
Choice? What choice?

59
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:56,511
Grow old and die in the future,

60
00:11:56,619 --> 00:11:59,213
or return here
with his freedom and faith restored.

61
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:00,788
Priests!

62
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:04,958
Now go, and remember,

63
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,459
there can be only one.

64
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:21,772
Okay, Mr. MacLeod.
The show is over.

65
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:25,003
I thought so too, Charlie.

66
00:12:25,113 --> 00:12:25,976
I really did.

67
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,808
I really did.

68
00:12:40,588 --> 00:12:44,523
<i>Good evening,
and welcome to TSC's nightly report.</i>

69
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,753
<i>Today's satellite readings
from above the shield</i>

70
00:12:46,861 --> 00:12:50,091
<i>confirm that highly dangerous
levels of ultraviolet radiation</i>

71
00:12:50,196 --> 00:12:52,165
<i>continue to bombard the planet</i>

72
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:54,564
<i>in the absence of the ozone layer,</i>

73
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:57,602
<i>but here, below the shield,
we are protected and safe.</i>

74
00:12:57,705 --> 00:13:00,070
<i>At a press conference held earlier,</i>

75
00:13:00,173 --> 00:13:02,573
<i>the corporation's
chief financial officer, David Blake,</i>

76
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:06,576
<i>denied growing rumors

77
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,842
<i>Alan Neyman, president of TSC,
was unavailable for comment,</i>

78
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:12,075
<i>and he seems increasingly isolated.</i>

79
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:19,158
<i>Shield Corporation.
May I help you?</i>

80
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:20,587
Alan Neyman, please.

81
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:23,059
<i>Who may I say is calling?</i>

82
00:13:23,162 --> 00:13:25,458
Tell him it's a friend.
Tell him it's MacLeod.

83
00:13:25,564 --> 00:13:26,428
<i>Please hold.</i>

84
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:27,998
Thank you.

85
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,795
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

86
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:31,801
<i>He's not accepting any calls
at the moment.</i>

87
00:13:31,903 --> 00:13:33,030
<i>Any message?</i>

88
00:13:33,137 --> 00:13:35,301
No. No message.

89
00:13:35,408 --> 00:13:36,395
<i>Thank you for calling.</i>

90
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:37,132
Thank you.

91
00:13:42,612 --> 00:13:44,911
Hey, grandpa,

92
00:13:45,015 --> 00:13:48,452
you got some change
for the oxygen machine?

93
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:51,020
Hey! Hey, you cheap fuck!

94
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,817
You deaf or what?

95
00:13:55,392 --> 00:13:57,053
You... You're MacLeod, aren't you?

96
00:13:59,130 --> 00:13:59,926
So what?

97
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:06,663
Yeah, right. So what?

98
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:08,532
Okay, okay.

99
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:10,128
Come on. We're outta here!

100
00:14:10,473 --> 00:14:11,769
Let's go!

101
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,307
Come on, let's go!

102
00:14:13,408 --> 00:14:15,000
Forget him.
Let's go! Move!

103
00:14:31,727 --> 00:14:32,625
What was that?

104
00:14:32,728 --> 00:14:34,126
What was what?

105
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:35,855
I heard something.
I'm calling it in.

106
00:14:35,964 --> 00:14:37,361
Security.

107
00:14:37,465 --> 00:14:40,401
I heard something.
You see anything?

108
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,061
I don't see nothing.
Could be fish.

109
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,832
Fish live in the lake.

110
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,531
Not in this lake.

111
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:47,903
Yeah?
Well, I've seen 'em.

112
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:49,203
It was a fish.

113
00:16:18,026 --> 00:16:19,427
Come on, Louise.
Let's do it.

114
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:22,356
Here it is.

115
00:16:48,955 --> 00:16:50,981
We've got 30 seconds
to get a clear reading.

116
00:16:54,795 --> 00:16:56,489
I'm going into the computer.

117
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:01,832
Blue alert!

118
00:17:05,705 --> 00:17:06,934
3-0 point 4-4!

119
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,366
Impossible.

120
00:17:10,476 --> 00:17:13,445
Radiation levels can't be normal.

121
00:17:13,545 --> 00:17:14,739
Go red!

122
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:17,548
Come on, Louise.
Keep moving!

123
00:17:17,648 --> 00:17:19,115
But you don't know
what this means.

124
00:17:19,217 --> 00:17:20,376
You can tell me about it later!

125
00:17:22,454 --> 00:17:23,922
Go, go, go!

126
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,785
Shoot! Shoot!

127
00:17:41,272 --> 00:17:42,000
Let's split up!

128
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,170
What now, gentlemen?

129
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,112
Isn't that your friend MacLeod,
General?

130
00:18:28,217 --> 00:18:31,276
He's getting older,
but he's still alive.

131
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:33,047
I know that!
I'm not blind!

132
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,123
Good. Then you can also see

133
00:18:36,223 --> 00:18:38,749
that he hasn't made his choice yet.

134
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,885
He still has time
to come back to us.

135
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,157
Wonderful.

136
00:18:44,265 --> 00:18:47,495
Corda! Reno!
Where are you?

137
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:53,103
There you are.

138
00:18:53,207 --> 00:18:56,404
I want you to leave
for the future immediately.

139
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:59,035
Find MacLeod and kill him.

140
00:18:59,145 --> 00:19:00,772
But I thought you said
MacLeod was mortal

141
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,040
and will never return.

142
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:06,380
Do me a big favor, Corda.
Don't think.

143
00:19:06,484 --> 00:19:07,680
He's an old man now.

144
00:19:07,788 --> 00:19:09,221
He'll be dead in a couple of weeks.

145
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:10,412
I don't care.

146
00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:13,083
Find him for me.
Kill him.

147
00:19:17,362 --> 00:19:19,854
It's so hard to get good help.

148
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:05,929
Hey, Jimmy.

149
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:07,166
Hey, Mr. MacLeod.

150
00:20:09,711 --> 00:20:10,680
How ya doin'?

151
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,544
Good, good.

152
00:20:12,648 --> 00:20:14,479
All right. All right.

153
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,016
- Ousceva?
- Ousceva.

154
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,280
Here you go.

155
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,787
<i>Good evening.</i>

156
00:20:21,891 --> 00:20:25,223
<i>Reports have just come in
of a terrorist attack</i>

<i>successfully made an attempt

161

<i>for propaganda purposes.</i>

162
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:38,067
<i>The Shield Corporation

163
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:39,902
<i>What Cobalt is doing is insanity.</i>

164

<i>Any tampering

00:20:47,181 --> 00:20:49,410
<i>by environmental terrorist
Louise Marcus,</i>

168
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:51,608
<i>who led the raid
and remains at large at this time.</i>

169
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:53,048
Pretty girl.

170
00:21:12,363 --> 00:21:13,694
You're a good boy, Jimmy.

171
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,129
Well, bottoms up.

172
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,395
Hey, are you MacLeod?

173
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:21,164
Hey, I asked you a question.

174
00:21:21,273 --> 00:21:22,636
Are you MacLeod?

175
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:24,675
Yes, I am.

176
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:27,209
Great. I always wanted to meet the guy

177
00:21:27,313 --> 00:21:29,403
that turned the world to shit.

178
00:21:29,514 --> 00:21:31,174
He saved our lives, if you ask me.

179
00:21:31,282 --> 00:21:33,183
I'm not asking you.

180
00:21:33,286 --> 00:21:36,014
Okay. What do you want?

181
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,918
Did you ever think about that

182
00:21:38,022 --> 00:21:40,957
before you covered the sky
with that puke?

183
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:43,958
- Who are you?
- Me?

184
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:48,761
I'm nobody, all right?

185
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:51,391
I work all day, and my life stinks,

186
00:21:51,502 --> 00:21:54,494
and it's your goddamned fault,
you old bastard.

187
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,369
Don't turn your back on me!

188
00:22:00,512 --> 00:22:03,413
There are some people in this world

189
00:22:03,515 --> 00:22:06,176
who know when to stop,

190
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:09,275
and some people who don't.

191
00:22:09,386 --> 00:22:11,114
Which kind are you?

192
00:22:11,221 --> 00:22:14,124
Okay, miss nobody, you're outta here.

193
00:22:14,225 --> 00:22:16,022
Come on, come on.

194
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:18,220
Come on, come on.
Get gone.

195
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:19,423
I'll see you again.

196
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:21,931
Anytime.

197
00:22:22,032 --> 00:22:25,024
Oh, Jesus.
Why do they always pick my place?

198
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,625
You know what I'm saying?

199
00:22:26,738 --> 00:22:28,364
I'm sorry, Mr. MacLeod.

200
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,838
No problem, Jimmy.
No problem.

201
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,909
Watch out!

202
00:22:32,011 --> 00:22:34,275
Son of a bitch!

203
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:36,176
Are you all right?

204
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:37,611
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be fine.

205
00:22:37,716 --> 00:22:38,978
You just hang in there,
Mr. MacLeod.

206
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:40,311
I'll be right back.

207
00:22:40,418 --> 00:22:41,784
Hey, you!
Come back here!

208
00:22:41,886 --> 00:22:43,650
I'm talking to you!

209
00:22:49,127 --> 00:22:51,027
Maybe I should get this one.

210
00:22:58,137 --> 00:22:59,967
What was that?

211
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:05,300
What the hell was that?

212
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:27,199
Oh, no.

213
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:32,828
Not again.

214
00:23:51,858 --> 00:23:53,520
Mr. MacLeod?

215
00:23:54,094 --> 00:23:55,425
Yes?

216
00:23:55,528 --> 00:23:58,021
I'm Louise Marcus.

217
00:23:58,131 --> 00:24:01,760
Terror is a dangerous business,
Miss Marcus.

218
00:24:01,868 --> 00:24:04,062
I'm not a terrorist.

219
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:05,637
Well, whatever you are,
Miss Marcus,

220
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:07,263
you'll have to excuse me.

221
00:24:07,374 --> 00:24:09,069
I've had some
very disturbing news.

222
00:24:09,176 --> 00:24:10,701
Did somebody die?

223
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:15,646
Unfortunately not.
Goodbye, Miss Marcus.

224
00:24:15,748 --> 00:24:18,808
You know,
I used to read about you.

225
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,250
You had such great passion
for the world.

226
00:24:22,355 --> 00:24:24,755
I admired you.

227
00:24:24,857 --> 00:24:27,225
I can see that's all gone now.

228
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:30,090
You're nothing
but a tired old man.

229
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:32,062
More than you know.

230
00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:37,298
Oh, no, you don't.

231
00:24:43,243 --> 00:24:45,232
The world is dying, MacLeod.

232
00:24:45,344 --> 00:24:47,644
I need your help.

233
00:24:47,749 --> 00:24:49,909
Please, get out of the car.

234
00:24:50,017 --> 00:24:50,985
No way.

235
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,554
Suit yourself.

236
00:25:05,832 --> 00:25:08,393
Listen, MacLeod.
When I broke in tonight,

237
00:25:08,502 --> 00:25:10,471
the numbers and figures I saw
didn't add up.

238
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,936
Something's wrong,
and Blake's trying to cover it up.

239
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,270
- What do you want me to do?
- Help me.

240
00:25:15,376 --> 00:25:17,172
I can't. Not now.

241
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:20,145
What happened to the MacLeod
that everyone believed in?

242
00:25:20,248 --> 00:25:22,739
That was 40 years ago.
I'm an old man.

243
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,373
Are you all right?
What's the matter?

244
00:25:28,087 --> 00:25:29,182
You gotta go.

245
00:25:48,442 --> 00:25:51,708
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

246
00:25:51,812 --> 00:25:53,679
MacLeod!

247
00:25:53,782 --> 00:25:54,943
Was that just a lucky guess?

248
00:25:57,218 --> 00:25:59,551
Wait a minute.
What are we doing?

249
00:25:59,655 --> 00:26:01,247
Get in there.
Don't make a sound.

250
00:26:01,358 --> 00:26:04,017
In here?
You've got to be kidding.

251
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:05,990
Come on!

252
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:07,858
Let me have him.

253
00:26:07,961 --> 00:26:09,430
But I want him!

254
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:12,498
It's my turn.
MacLeod?

255
00:26:12,601 --> 00:26:17,061
You're going to die!

256
00:26:27,383 --> 00:26:29,442
Ramirez!
My old friend Ramirez!

257
00:26:59,981 --> 00:27:01,472
Thank you!

258
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:39,975
My God.

259
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:52,836
I hate to say goodbye,
Highlander!

260
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,805
Why? You going somewhere?

261
00:33:14,863 --> 00:33:17,558
Hey, pal!
You got a light?

262
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:18,792
Thank...

263
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:54,903
Come on.

264
00:33:55,704 --> 00:33:56,762
Come on!

265
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:33,297
Ramirez!

266
00:34:40,284 --> 00:34:44,618
Ramirez!

267
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:55,423
Alas, poor Yorick!

268
00:34:55,531 --> 00:34:57,121
I knew him, Horatio.

269
00:35:06,996 --> 00:35:08,893
Well, now.

270
00:35:10,995 --> 00:35:14,188
Alas, poor Yorick!

271
00:35:14,294 --> 00:35:16,485
I knew him, Horatio...

272
00:35:16,593 --> 00:35:19,522
Actually, the name is Ramirez.

273
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:21,523
Will you get out of here?

274
00:35:21,627 --> 00:35:22,851
Excuse me?

275
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:26,582
A fellow of infinite jest,

276
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,589
of most excellent fancy...

277
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,382
Forgive me for interrupting

278
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:33,613
your conversation, but...

279
00:35:33,722 --> 00:35:37,849
He hath borne me upon his back
a thousand times.

280
00:35:37,955 --> 00:35:43,351
And now, how abhorred
in my imagination it is!

281
00:35:43,454 --> 00:35:46,352
My gorge rises at it.

282
00:35:46,454 --> 00:35:49,318
Here hung those lips
that I have kissed

283
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,850
I know not how oft.

284
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:53,975
Sir, whatever you gentlemen

285
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,573
felt for each other

286
00:35:55,684 --> 00:35:57,547
when your friend was still alive

287
00:35:57,652 --> 00:36:00,740
is certainly none of my affair.

288
00:36:00,848 --> 00:36:04,043
What's your fucking game,
shithead?

289
00:36:04,148 --> 00:36:07,807
Shithead?
What's a shithead?

290
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,847
Get off the stage!

291
00:36:18,746 --> 00:36:20,713
My apologies.

292
00:36:22,578 --> 00:36:24,568
Enough of this useless banter.

293
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,668
I shall be on my way,

294
00:36:26,777 --> 00:36:29,869
and leave you
to converse with your skull.

295
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,443
Farewell, dear shithead.

296
00:36:33,977 --> 00:36:35,410
Farewell.

297
00:36:56,538 --> 00:36:58,165
Rather glad the magic works.

298
00:37:08,437 --> 00:37:10,334
So much for the horse and cart.

299
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:18,033
Louise.

300
00:37:42,495 --> 00:37:44,051
Who are you?

301
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:49,955
I'm Connor MacLeod
of the clan MacLeod.

302
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,854
And I cannot die.

303
00:38:27,886 --> 00:38:29,874
I'm Louise Marcus
from Flagstaff, Arizona.

304
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,774
Okay, now let me just see
if I can get this straight.

305
00:39:22,876 --> 00:39:26,930
You're mortal there,
but you're immortal here

306
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:30,870
until you kill all the guys from there
who've come here,

307
00:39:30,974 --> 00:39:33,531
and then you're mortal here.

308
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,832
Unless you go back there

309
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,733
or some more guys
from there come here,

310
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:43,859
in which case you become
immortal here... again.

311
00:39:43,972 --> 00:39:46,800
- Something like that.
- Of course.

312
00:39:46,904 --> 00:39:48,596
It would be something like that,
wouldn't it?

313
00:39:50,135 --> 00:39:51,397
Quite a night.

314
00:39:51,503 --> 00:39:52,797
Tell me about it.

315
00:39:52,901 --> 00:39:54,729
Think I do this every Saturday night?

316
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:56,698
Let's say it's a kind of magic.

317
00:39:56,802 --> 00:39:58,993
That's not what I was talking about.

318
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,328
So... what do you want me to do?

319
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:05,126
You built the shield.

320
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:06,663
Maybe you can figure out
what's going on up there.

321
00:40:06,765 --> 00:40:08,891
What are you saying?

322
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:12,863
Something is being kept
very, very quiet.

323
00:40:12,964 --> 00:40:16,328
Even your old pal Alan
is on a tight leash.

324
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,861
I couldn't get anyone
to listen to me.

325
00:40:17,964 --> 00:40:19,895
So you started Cobalt,

326
00:40:19,996 --> 00:40:22,189
got your face on national TV.

327
00:40:23,495 --> 00:40:25,427
Well, of course!

328
00:40:25,528 --> 00:40:27,426
Somebody had to get
people's attention,

329
00:40:27,528 --> 00:40:28,824
start asking questions,

330
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,858
find out the truth.

331
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,120
Someone like you?

332
00:40:32,227 --> 00:40:34,886
No, damn it!

333
00:40:34,994 --> 00:40:36,856
Someone like you.

334
00:41:03,687 --> 00:41:04,812
Excellent threads, dude.

335
00:41:08,818 --> 00:41:10,215
Shithead.

336
00:41:27,316 --> 00:41:28,976
May I help you, sir?

337
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:30,707
I would like a suit of clothes.

338
00:41:30,814 --> 00:41:32,746
And why not, indeed?

339
00:41:32,849 --> 00:41:35,335
We are the oldest gentlemen's
tailor in Scotland.

340
00:41:35,447 --> 00:41:38,435
Well, then,
I've come to the right place,

341
00:41:38,545 --> 00:41:41,536
since I am, without a doubt,
the oldest gentleman in Scotland.

342
00:41:42,879 --> 00:41:45,537
Well, if you say so, sir.

343
00:41:45,645 --> 00:41:47,542
Well, let's get started.

344
00:41:47,646 --> 00:41:49,543
I have a long journey ahead of me

345
00:41:49,646 --> 00:41:52,110
and limited time.

346
00:41:52,212 --> 00:41:55,039
I'm afraid
sir still doesn't understand.

347
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:58,734
A suit may take
several weeks to complete.

348
00:41:58,842 --> 00:42:03,399
I'm afraid
sir damn well does understand,

349
00:42:03,509 --> 00:42:05,995
and sir would like a suit
of clothes by 3 o'clock.

350
00:42:51,331 --> 00:42:54,763
There is nothing like a challenge
to bring out the best in man.

351
00:42:58,264 --> 00:42:59,923
With our compliments, sir.

352
00:43:01,697 --> 00:43:04,356
Thank you, Roy.

353
00:43:04,463 --> 00:43:06,588
Can we arrange a limo for you, sir?

354
00:43:06,694 --> 00:43:08,059
"Limo"?

355
00:43:08,162 --> 00:43:10,525
Yes. To take you to the airport.

356
00:43:10,627 --> 00:43:11,718
"Airport"?

357
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:15,123
You did say you had a long journey
ahead of you.

358
00:43:15,227 --> 00:43:16,657
Yes.

359
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,350
Well, I believe the fastest way
is still to fly.

360
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,686
To fly...

361
00:43:22,792 --> 00:43:24,189
Yes, of course.

362
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,012
To fly.

363
00:43:51,281 --> 00:43:53,772
Have you ever seen
a blue sky?

364
00:43:56,352 --> 00:43:57,683
Sure.

365
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,578
What was it like?

366
00:44:09,662 --> 00:44:11,251
It was...

367
00:44:14,564 --> 00:44:18,330
It was the deepest blue
you ever saw.

368
00:44:18,434 --> 00:44:20,400
But it was more than that.

369
00:44:23,605 --> 00:44:26,698
White clouds suddenly
turning dark with rain...

370
00:44:33,178 --> 00:44:36,147
And the smell of grass
after the storm.

371
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:42,615
Red leaves in fall.

372
00:44:42,718 --> 00:44:44,209
Snow in winter.

373
00:44:47,156 --> 00:44:48,351
It was beautiful.

374
00:44:58,366 --> 00:45:00,831
And we thought
it would last forever.

375
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:12,264
I wish you could have seen it.

376
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:16,907
So do I.

377
00:45:22,215 --> 00:45:23,807
I'd like to...

378
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:28,014
Just once before I die.

379
00:45:41,331 --> 00:45:44,093
Ah, yes...

380
00:45:44,633 --> 00:45:46,157
Yes...

381
00:45:55,576 --> 00:45:57,666
I guess if you want something done...

382
00:45:59,411 --> 00:46:00,503
you have to do it yourself.

383
00:46:11,054 --> 00:46:13,247
<i>It's the wackiest show on TVI</i>

384
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,380
<i>The psychic cook!</i>

385
00:46:15,492 --> 00:46:18,652
<i>Step into the paranormal pantry
with the special guest ghosts</i>

386
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,888
<i>and prepare meals
from beyond the grave!</i>

387
00:46:21,996 --> 00:46:24,485
<i>Spooky sauces to ghostly "ghoulashes."</i>

388
00:46:24,629 --> 00:46:26,597
<i>It's a whole lot of fun!</i>

389
00:46:26,697 --> 00:46:29,165
<i>The psychic cook,
weekdays at 5:00.</i>

390
00:46:29,266 --> 00:46:31,359
<i>Brought to you by Xenon,</i>

391
00:46:31,469 --> 00:46:33,936
<i>the world's highest grade
of non-emission gasoline.</i>

392
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:36,028
<i>Available at service stations everywhere.</i>

393
00:46:36,138 --> 00:46:37,935
<i>Only $55 per gallon.</i>

394
00:47:00,425 --> 00:47:02,357
It happens again!

395
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,112
That was great!

396
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:34,443
Yes!

397
00:47:40,452 --> 00:47:41,920
Where the hell am I?

398
00:47:48,961 --> 00:47:53,056
This sure doesn't
look like Kansas, does it?

399
00:47:53,196 --> 00:47:55,324
Godzilla!

400
00:47:55,431 --> 00:47:57,331
Oh, Godzilla!

401
00:47:58,033 --> 00:47:59,624
Godzilla!

402
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:11,638
Oh, God!

403
00:48:15,181 --> 00:48:16,740
Did you see that?

404
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:26,682
Yo, look out!

405
00:48:30,393 --> 00:48:32,417
You're a little one, aren't ya?

406
00:48:36,195 --> 00:48:38,665
Bet you've always wanted
to drive one of these, huh?

407
00:48:40,534 --> 00:48:41,862
Me, too.

408
00:48:46,105 --> 00:48:47,765
Hi!

409
00:49:16,961 --> 00:49:18,121
Yes!

410
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:41,604
Give me more!

411
00:50:04,862 --> 00:50:06,557
Let's have some fun!

412
00:50:32,852 --> 00:50:33,840
Oh, my God!

413
00:50:53,768 --> 00:50:55,098
Last stop.

414
00:51:43,339 --> 00:51:46,238
Can't even make
a decent cup of coffee anymore.

415
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,070
You always use too much water.

416
00:51:49,175 --> 00:51:50,108
Mac?

417
00:51:50,211 --> 00:51:51,539
Alan.

418
00:51:51,643 --> 00:51:54,169
Where the hell have you been?

419
00:51:56,312 --> 00:51:57,974
I'm so glad you're here.

420
00:51:58,083 --> 00:52:00,677
So many things have happened.

421
00:52:00,782 --> 00:52:01,750
We must talk.

422
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:03,318
Okay.

423
00:52:03,418 --> 00:52:04,977
Good God.

424
00:52:08,456 --> 00:52:11,821
You look fantastic!

425
00:52:11,927 --> 00:52:14,484
What have you been doing?
Working out?

426
00:52:17,963 --> 00:52:19,554
Have you had a face-lift?

427
00:52:19,664 --> 00:52:22,098
Something like that.

428
00:52:26,872 --> 00:52:28,861
Do you remember
the dreams we had?

429
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:48,313
Remember the day?

430
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:49,478
<i>Good evening.</i>

431
00:52:49,587 --> 00:52:53,887
<i>Only a few months now until the
ozone layer is completely gone.</i>

432
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:57,357
<i>A team of international scientists
led by Dr. Alan Neyman</i>

433
00:52:57,459 --> 00:53:00,485
<i>and supervised by Connor
MacLeod work around the clock.</i>

434
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,962
<i>This may be the last chance
for planet Earth.</i>

435
00:53:03,965 --> 00:53:07,663
<i>This is TSC.
We are standing by for shield launch.</i>

436
00:53:14,074 --> 00:53:16,940
They'll remember this day
for a thousand years.

437
00:53:17,042 --> 00:53:19,976
The day we protected the planet
from the sun.

438
00:53:20,076 --> 00:53:25,207
<i>All personnel please leave the area.
We are starting the final countdown.</i>

439
00:53:27,885 --> 00:53:30,180
<i>All personnel please leave the area.</i>

440
00:53:30,285 --> 00:53:33,275
<i>We are starting the final countdown.</i>

441
00:53:34,288 --> 00:53:36,916
<i>TSC, this is Florida Control.</i>

442
00:53:37,023 --> 00:53:38,184
<i>All power for the shield...</i>

443
00:53:38,291 --> 00:53:39,781
<i>All systems are go.</i>

444
00:53:39,891 --> 00:53:41,224
<i>Please run final checks
on all shield power.</i>

445
00:53:41,327 --> 00:53:43,317
<i>All personnel please leave the area.</i>

446
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:45,294
<i>We are starting the final countdown.</i>

447
00:53:56,705 --> 00:53:59,170
<i>TSC, this is
Houston Space Control.</i>

448
00:53:59,274 --> 00:54:01,869
<i>Satellite is in final receiving position.</i>

449
00:54:01,976 --> 00:54:03,670
<i>You can start final countdown.</i>

450
00:54:04,977 --> 00:54:06,604
Stand by. This is it.

451
00:54:06,711 --> 00:54:07,679
Roger, control.

452
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:08,712
We are standing by.

453
00:54:08,814 --> 00:54:09,782
This is it!

454
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:19,045
<i>Florida Control, this is TSC.</i>

455
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:22,518
<i>The December shield installation
is ready to receive.</i>

456
00:54:22,624 --> 00:54:27,584
<i>All power sources around the world,
this is TSC. We are ready to receive.</i>

457
00:54:31,265 --> 00:54:32,662
<i>Launch minus 10...</i>

458
00:54:32,766 --> 00:54:33,893
10 seconds and counting.

459
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,194
Okay, boys.
Let's make this a good one.

460
00:54:36,303 --> 00:54:37,235
The world is watching.

461
00:54:37,336 --> 00:54:38,461
<i>4...</i>

462
00:54:38,568 --> 00:54:39,467
<i>3...</i>

463
00:54:39,572 --> 00:54:40,698
<i>2...</i>

464
00:54:40,805 --> 00:54:43,330
<i>1... Ignition.</i>

465
00:55:20,468 --> 00:55:22,629
What a day...

466
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:24,293
What a great day.

467
00:55:26,306 --> 00:55:28,902
It was a great idea,
wasn't it, Mac?

468
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:31,102
It still is.

469
00:55:31,146 --> 00:55:32,704
But you don't know what's happened.

470
00:55:35,042 --> 00:55:36,304
<i>It's wonderful!</i>

471
00:55:36,409 --> 00:55:37,805
<i>Come here. I'll show you.</i>

472
00:55:37,909 --> 00:55:39,808
Come on. Shh, shh, shh.

473
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:25,938
Forgive me, Alan.

474
00:56:26,048 --> 00:56:28,670
I didn't realize
you got in this early.

475
00:56:28,778 --> 00:56:30,674
Not usually,

476
00:56:30,777 --> 00:56:33,571
but we got to talking.

477
00:56:33,675 --> 00:56:34,901
Forgive me.

478
00:56:35,009 --> 00:56:37,235
David Blake, Connor MacLeod.

479
00:56:37,339 --> 00:56:39,963
Ah, yes, of course.

480
00:56:40,071 --> 00:56:42,297
I'm afraid I'd forgotten
you were still alive.

481
00:56:42,404 --> 00:56:43,630
Always.

482
00:56:45,634 --> 00:56:47,190
Something on the computer?

483
00:56:47,301 --> 00:56:50,195
Oh, no. No, no.

484
00:56:50,298 --> 00:56:51,423
Nothing I won't remember.

485
00:56:51,531 --> 00:56:52,495
I hope so.

486
00:56:52,597 --> 00:56:56,789
Alan, as long as we have you here,
we might as well get off to an early start.

487
00:56:56,895 --> 00:56:57,880
- Fine.
- My office?

488
00:56:57,994 --> 00:56:59,117
All right.

489
00:56:59,226 --> 00:57:01,452
Good.

490
00:57:01,558 --> 00:57:03,750
Mr. MacLeod, I'm terribly sorry
to have to break this up,

491
00:57:03,857 --> 00:57:06,084
but I trust you can find
your own way out?

492
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:07,517
Sure.

493
00:57:07,622 --> 00:57:09,143
Take care of yourself, Alan.

494
00:57:12,884 --> 00:57:15,280
Oh, by the way,
how is the shield business?

495
00:57:15,383 --> 00:57:16,441
Never better.

496
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:20,501
It must be great to have every
country in the world as your customer.

497
00:57:20,613 --> 00:57:22,875
Actually, Mr. MacLeod,
we prefer to think

498
00:57:22,979 --> 00:57:25,637
that we protect
the population of the planet

499
00:57:25,744 --> 00:57:28,935
from death by solar radiation.

500
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:31,971
It is a rather unique service,
don't you agree?

501
00:57:32,072 --> 00:57:33,596
As long as it's necessary.

502
00:57:33,705 --> 00:57:35,000
Meaning?

503
00:57:35,105 --> 00:57:38,658
Maybe one day the ozone layer
will repair itself.

504
00:57:38,769 --> 00:57:44,097
That would indeed be a great day
for the human race, wouldn't it?

505
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:49,185
But it really makes no difference anymore,
since you built the shield to last forever.

506
00:57:49,296 --> 00:57:52,055
Nothing lasts forever.

507
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:11,675
My name's Jerry Pritchard, man.
What do they call you?

508
00:58:11,782 --> 00:58:14,008
It's quite comfortable back here.

509
00:58:14,114 --> 00:58:15,873
- Rather like a coffin.
- Right.

510
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:19,307
People in this town,
they'd kill you for a nickel, man.

511
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:21,170
Hey, cabby! Hey, cabby!
What's up!

512
00:58:21,276 --> 00:58:24,604
Get the fuck away from my car!
Scumbags! Scumbags!

513
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:25,571
Really.

514
00:58:25,673 --> 00:58:29,330
You're in the music business,
aren't you?

515
00:58:29,436 --> 00:58:31,732
Call it a hunch.
I knew that.

516
00:58:40,431 --> 00:58:42,488
So, you're in the music business.
Man, that's cool.

517
00:58:42,596 --> 00:58:45,617
I wish I was in the music business.
My sister was in the music business.

518
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,056
You should meet her.
You two would get along.

519
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:48,124
- I really do.
- Stop now.

520
00:58:48,225 --> 00:58:50,158
- What, here?
- Now.

521
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,451
This is good.

522
00:58:51,558 --> 00:58:52,781
This is a good place to stop...

523
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:55,914
Goddamn!

524
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:57,451
Shit!

525
00:58:57,553 --> 00:58:58,849
Fuck! Yeah!

526
00:59:02,954 --> 00:59:05,380
I'll get out here.

527
00:59:08,815 --> 00:59:10,244
Outta control!

528
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:13,107
You and my sister, man,
forget it!

529
00:59:13,211 --> 00:59:14,698
I should introduce you two.

530
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:16,274
You could sit around and...

531
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:18,839
compare tattoos or something, man.

532
00:59:18,941 --> 00:59:20,304
You're crazy!

533
00:59:24,006 --> 00:59:25,195
What next, man?

534
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,998
Central, this is Jerry Pritchard, man!

535
00:59:31,099 --> 00:59:32,621
Hello? Hello?

536
00:59:32,731 --> 00:59:35,026
Shit, man.
I should have stayed in school.

537
00:59:35,131 --> 00:59:36,494
Central, hello? I've got...

538
00:59:36,598 --> 00:59:38,992
Just take it easy, all right?

539
00:59:39,095 --> 00:59:41,117
Come on. Come on. Cen-central!

540
00:59:41,227 --> 00:59:42,420
Central!

541
00:59:43,525 --> 00:59:44,389
Shit, ma...

542
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:53,642
Put all this on my tab,

543
00:59:53,754 --> 00:59:55,219
and, Jerry...

544
00:59:55,318 --> 00:59:57,544
add a little something for yourself.

545
01:00:03,947 --> 01:00:05,139
Yes.

546
01:00:07,277 --> 01:00:09,139
Yes.

547
01:00:11,276 --> 01:00:12,970
Yes.

548
01:00:20,937 --> 01:00:22,923
Forgive me asking yet again, but...

549
01:00:23,035 --> 01:00:27,054
how do we remain so high
above the Earth with safety?

550
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:29,789
By drinkin'.

551
01:00:36,593 --> 01:00:39,650
<i>Welcome to your transatlantic flight.</i>

552
01:00:39,758 --> 01:00:41,381
<i>Please fasten your seatbelt.</i>

553
01:00:44,321 --> 01:00:47,548
<i>In the unlikely event
of a loss of cabin pressure,</i>

554
01:00:47,652 --> 01:00:49,948
<i>oxygen masks will drop from the ceiling.</i>

555
01:00:50,051 --> 01:00:53,016
<i>Place it over your mouth and nose
and breathe normally.</i>

556
01:00:54,715 --> 01:00:57,010
<i>In case of fire,
please do not panic.</i>

557
01:00:57,114 --> 01:00:59,545
<i>Place smoke hood over your head
and crawl to your nearest exit.</i>

558
01:01:08,508 --> 01:01:10,596
<i>Thank you for flying with us,
and enjoy your flight.</i>

559
01:01:30,294 --> 01:01:32,087
My kind of town.

560
01:01:36,256 --> 01:01:37,687
I'm waiting, MacLeod.

561
01:01:42,554 --> 01:01:44,109
Come to me.

562
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:49,908
I'm waiting!

563
01:01:54,645 --> 01:01:57,166
But on the contrary, Virginia,

564
01:01:57,277 --> 01:02:00,639
all of the most beautiful women
had dark hair.

565
01:02:00,743 --> 01:02:02,706
Helen of Troy, Cleopatra,

566
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:05,136
Nefertiti, Joan of Arc,

567
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,829
to name but a few.

568
01:02:07,937 --> 01:02:12,526
In fact, it's well known
that the dark-haired ladies

569
01:02:12,635 --> 01:02:14,359
like to sit on men's faces.

570
01:02:17,031 --> 01:02:18,520
Would you like to order something?

571
01:02:18,629 --> 01:02:20,858
Thank you.
May I have some water, please?

572
01:02:20,963 --> 01:02:22,328
Of course.
Something else for you, sir?

573
01:02:22,428 --> 01:02:25,326
Oh, no, thank you.
I never eat anything I cannot identify.

574
01:02:25,426 --> 01:02:27,120
Thank you.

575
01:02:31,557 --> 01:02:32,952
That's not entirely true, of course.

576
01:02:39,483 --> 01:02:41,041
Forgive me, my husband,

577
01:02:41,152 --> 01:02:43,644
for leaving you so soon.

578
01:02:43,758 --> 01:02:45,519
I am so scared, Connor.

579
01:02:50,097 --> 01:02:52,795
I wanted to stay and love you.

580
01:02:52,901 --> 01:02:55,426
The sun is killing us.

581
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:57,598
Help the ones that are still alive.

582
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:02,308
Hold my hand.

583
01:03:02,414 --> 01:03:05,541
Promise me, Connor.

584
01:03:05,652 --> 01:03:08,622
Anything.

585
01:03:08,722 --> 01:03:11,851
Promise me
you'll do something to stop this.

586
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:14,260
Aye, love, I will.

587
01:03:24,075 --> 01:03:25,506
I love you.

588
01:04:05,461 --> 01:04:08,692
It was all going to be
so good, so clean.

589
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:10,858
And for one brief moment, it was.

590
01:04:12,503 --> 01:04:15,472
I used to wish
you were here to see it,

591
01:04:15,572 --> 01:04:17,975
but not anymore.

592
01:04:18,077 --> 01:04:20,569
Not after what it's become,

593
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,546
what it's done to us.

594
01:04:24,018 --> 01:04:26,849
Bravo. Bravo.

595
01:04:26,954 --> 01:04:29,948
Excellent.

596
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:33,186
I always did admire
a man who could talk to the dead.

597
01:04:40,304 --> 01:04:42,399
It's so good to see you again,
MacLeod.

598
01:04:44,677 --> 01:04:47,011
The remains of your mortal wife.

599
01:04:47,114 --> 01:04:49,139
So frail,

600
01:04:49,249 --> 01:04:51,615
so very dead.

601
01:04:52,586 --> 01:04:54,248
At least she's at peace.

602
01:04:54,355 --> 01:04:57,690
Peace is highly overrated.

603
01:04:57,793 --> 01:04:59,386
Things don't change, Katana.

604
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:02,160
I like that.

605
01:05:02,266 --> 01:05:05,533
After all these years,
you're still a jerk.

606
01:05:07,273 --> 01:05:08,331
What do you mean?

607
01:05:08,441 --> 01:05:13,140
After all this time,
I was ready to kick back, grow old and die.

608
01:05:13,247 --> 01:05:17,309
You changed everything,

609
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:19,388
and now I'm back to square one.

610
01:05:19,488 --> 01:05:21,455
Immortal. Again!

611
01:05:21,557 --> 01:05:24,358
So, Katana,

612
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,988
let's see who goes back after all.

613
01:05:30,302 --> 01:05:33,136
I rather like this place.

614
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:35,330
It's got atmosphere.

615
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,804
I just might stay.

616
01:05:37,944 --> 01:05:39,071
Get off!

617
01:05:39,846 --> 01:05:42,078
Remember the golden rule,
Highlander.

618
01:05:42,184 --> 01:05:44,153
We must never fight
on holy ground.

619
01:05:45,623 --> 01:05:47,418
And this

620
01:05:47,524 --> 01:05:49,583
is holy ground.

621
01:05:54,064 --> 01:05:55,999
Ashes to ashes,

622
01:05:56,101 --> 01:05:58,037
dust to dust.

623
01:05:58,137 --> 01:06:01,073
If you don't take it out and use it,
it's going to rust.

624
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:50,500
<i>On 3... Break!</i>

625
01:06:50,603 --> 01:06:54,405
<i>Red 36, Blue 21!
Hike! Hike! Hike!</i>

626
01:07:05,758 --> 01:07:08,886
<i>Ship's log, The Rosemary.</i>

627
01:07:08,995 --> 01:07:10,984
<i>The men are all gone now.</i>

628
01:07:11,096 --> 01:07:13,862
<i>God rest their souls.</i>

629
01:07:13,967 --> 01:07:16,801
<i>I alone have come back from the dead</i>

630
01:07:16,905 --> 01:07:18,235
<i>again.</i>

631
01:07:18,341 --> 01:07:21,400
<i>Who knows how long
I will continue to drift?</i>

632
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:25,074
<i>Days? Months? Years?</i>

633
01:07:25,183 --> 01:07:29,381
<i>As of this date,
September 6, 1853,</i>

634
01:07:29,487 --> 01:07:32,719
<i>Captain MacLeod no longer exists.</i>

635
01:07:32,826 --> 01:07:34,293
<i>Will this never end?</i>

636
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:00,204
Not bad.

637
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:11,478
Nicely played, MacLeod.

638
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:13,343
But the game's not over yet.

639
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:53,162
What happened to you?
Are you all right?

640
01:12:54,102 --> 01:12:55,068
I'm fine.

641
01:12:59,707 --> 01:13:01,871
Who is the girl in the painting?

642
01:13:05,448 --> 01:13:06,473
That was Heather,

643
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:09,077
my first wife.

644
01:13:09,186 --> 01:13:12,179
We lived in Scotland in 1542.

645
01:13:14,962 --> 01:13:16,430
What was she like?

646
01:13:18,333 --> 01:13:20,129
Full of love.

647
01:13:20,235 --> 01:13:21,599
Full of life.

648
01:13:21,705 --> 01:13:23,262
Till the end.

649
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:27,232
I held her in my arms
when she died.

650
01:13:28,711 --> 01:13:30,180
An old woman.

651
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,977
I still loved her.

652
01:13:36,389 --> 01:13:38,856
And the other?

653
01:13:38,957 --> 01:13:39,755
That's Brenda,

654
01:13:39,859 --> 01:13:42,386
my last wife.

655
01:13:42,495 --> 01:13:43,659
She looks lovely.

656
01:13:45,735 --> 01:13:46,896
She was.

657
01:13:47,003 --> 01:13:50,529
She died in New York 29 years ago.

658
01:13:52,276 --> 01:13:54,540
That's a long time to be alone.

659
01:13:55,747 --> 01:13:57,738
You get used to it.

660
01:13:58,616 --> 01:14:00,414
Do you really?

661
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,646
No.

662
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:09,692
What is it?

663
01:14:12,101 --> 01:14:13,830
Oh, no. Not again.

664
01:14:13,936 --> 01:14:14,767
Go upstairs.

665
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:18,504
Damn.

666
01:14:53,654 --> 01:14:55,213
Greetings, Highlander.

667
01:14:55,323 --> 01:14:56,153
You called?

668
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:00,921
Incredible.

669
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:03,022
What took you so long?

670
01:15:03,133 --> 01:15:04,689
They could have killed me.

671
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,067
Don't be ridiculous.

672
01:15:17,753 --> 01:15:19,880
You've remembered
almost everything I taught you.

673
01:15:19,987 --> 01:15:22,684
I've had a lot of practice lately.

674
01:15:30,266 --> 01:15:32,098
There is no substitute for experience.

675
01:15:32,202 --> 01:15:33,830
What experience?

676
01:15:33,938 --> 01:15:35,599
You've been dead for 500 years.

677
01:15:35,707 --> 01:15:36,868
So?

678
01:15:36,975 --> 01:15:38,169
Watch it!

679
01:15:38,278 --> 01:15:40,269
- Watch what?
- Watch what?

680
01:15:40,378 --> 01:15:41,814
The sculpture!

681
01:15:42,615 --> 01:15:43,674
That's a sculpture?

682
01:15:45,153 --> 01:15:46,815
Now you are being ridiculous.

683
01:16:08,014 --> 01:16:09,778
Remember, MacLeod,

684
01:16:09,884 --> 01:16:11,784
you called me.

685
01:16:28,553 --> 01:16:30,782
- To magic.
- Magic works.

686
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:39,378
It's nice to see that some things
have actually improved over the years.

687
01:16:39,487 --> 01:16:41,578
Is this private?

688
01:16:41,686 --> 01:16:44,084
Not necessarily.

689
01:16:44,185 --> 01:16:47,811
This is Juan Sanchez Villalobos Ramirez,
my old friend and teacher

690
01:16:47,921 --> 01:16:49,545
visiting from Scotland.

691
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:51,916
Visiting most unexpectedly
from Scotland.

692
01:16:52,021 --> 01:16:53,145
This is Louise Marcus.

693
01:16:53,254 --> 01:16:54,548
Watch it.

694
01:16:54,653 --> 01:16:56,777
She's wanted by the police.

695
01:16:56,886 --> 01:17:00,114
I didn't realize
the police had such good taste.

696
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:05,480
So, uh, you two have known each other
for a long time.

697
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:09,114
Seems like an eternity.

698
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,581
Please don't bother, Alan.

699
01:17:13,688 --> 01:17:16,983
Every time you turn that thing on,
it just gets printed out in my office.

700
01:17:17,085 --> 01:17:19,418
And yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

701
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,508
that includes your little
computer conversation

702
01:17:21,619 --> 01:17:23,709
with MacLeod the other day.

703
01:17:23,822 --> 01:17:26,808
Besides, what good
could you possible do, old man?

704
01:17:26,918 --> 01:17:28,349
What do you mean?

705
01:17:28,452 --> 01:17:30,216
I don't know.

706
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,285
How about for starters,

707
01:17:32,385 --> 01:17:34,079
that there simply
isn't enough energy on the planet

708
01:17:34,187 --> 01:17:35,981
to take down the shield
without killing us all.

709
01:17:36,087 --> 01:17:39,576
If I'm going too fast, slow me down.
But I think you should know this all, Alan.

710
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:41,550
I mean, you designed the thing.

711
01:17:41,653 --> 01:17:44,244
You and this MacLeod.

712
01:17:44,352 --> 01:17:47,183
But that was only in case
the shield was threatened.

713
01:17:51,018 --> 01:17:52,850
Well, that's funny, Alan!

714
01:17:52,953 --> 01:17:57,078
'Cause I was under the impression
that that's precisely what had happened.

715
01:17:59,252 --> 01:18:01,481
But it really doesn't matter now,
does it?

716
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:09,645
Why don't you and I try and relax.
No tears.

717
01:18:11,587 --> 01:18:13,677
Because it's business as usual...

718
01:18:14,718 --> 01:18:16,083
forever.

719
01:18:16,818 --> 01:18:19,012
You've allowed yourself
to become a traitor, Alan.

720
01:18:19,122 --> 01:18:21,019
And, as I think you know,

721
01:18:21,184 --> 01:18:25,549
we have a fabulous place for traitors,
don't we?

722
01:18:31,153 --> 01:18:37,984
Gentlemen, I can now assure you
that Cobalt will no longer be a problem.

723
01:18:38,085 --> 01:18:39,746
In fact, earlier today,

724
01:18:39,853 --> 01:18:43,412
the shield police were once again
able to stop an attempt at...

725
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:53,246
Hi.

726
01:18:53,353 --> 01:18:54,784
Excuse me,

727
01:18:54,886 --> 01:18:58,112
but I do believe that you'll find
the costume party is in another building.

728
01:18:58,222 --> 01:19:00,278
This happens to be a meeting.

729
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:03,576
And no one interrupts
a meeting of the corporation.

730
01:19:03,684 --> 01:19:05,582
The corporation.

731
01:19:05,685 --> 01:19:09,618
What luck. You see,
I've come to join the corporation.

732
01:19:10,019 --> 01:19:11,451
And here you all are.

733
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:16,079
Where do I sign up?

734
01:19:16,186 --> 01:19:18,673
Oh, I think I've had enough of you.

735
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:20,480
Goodbye, Attila.

736
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:37,278
Yes, yes, indeed.

737
01:19:37,385 --> 01:19:39,080
That was brilliantly done.

738
01:19:39,184 --> 01:19:40,618
Bravo.

739
01:19:51,318 --> 01:19:52,750
Yes!

740
01:19:54,251 --> 01:20:00,184
You know, guys. This is no way to treat
your number one draft choice.

741
01:20:53,687 --> 01:20:55,348
Partners.

742
01:20:55,453 --> 01:21:00,314
I believe you cannot run a business
without partners.

743
01:21:00,419 --> 01:21:01,384
Right.

744
01:21:01,486 --> 01:21:02,814
This is a business, isn't it?

745
01:21:02,916 --> 01:21:04,110
Oh, yes, it is.

746
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:07,918
We like to think of it
as a good business.

747
01:21:10,252 --> 01:21:12,376
What exactly is it
that you want...

748
01:21:13,817 --> 01:21:14,785
partner?

749
01:21:19,518 --> 01:21:21,711
The Highlander.

750
01:21:21,819 --> 01:21:23,752
Right.

751
01:21:23,853 --> 01:21:25,216
Wilson,

752
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:28,216
could we get on the Highlander thing
as soon as possible?

753
01:21:43,251 --> 01:21:44,910
MacLeod.

754
01:21:52,084 --> 01:21:54,810
You created that monstrosity?

755
01:21:54,917 --> 01:21:56,974
Why?

756
01:21:57,082 --> 01:22:00,049
It was necessary at the time.

757
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:04,676
So was Noah's flood,
but that at least served its purpose.

758
01:22:04,787 --> 01:22:08,840
Cleansed the earth from evil,
and gave it a fresh start.

759
01:22:08,951 --> 01:22:11,111
33-degrees...

760
01:22:12,486 --> 01:22:16,212
26-minutes north latitude.

761
01:22:16,321 --> 01:22:18,782
That's where Neyman said
there was a system failure.

762
01:22:18,883 --> 01:22:20,215
Meaning what?

763
01:22:20,318 --> 01:22:23,944
Meaning we can go above the shield.

764
01:22:24,052 --> 01:22:26,348
We will still require
a longitude, won't we?

765
01:22:26,453 --> 01:22:27,416
MacLeod?

766
01:22:29,518 --> 01:22:31,246
Alan Neyman's been taken to Max.

767
01:22:31,352 --> 01:22:33,542
Max? Who's Max?

768
01:22:33,651 --> 01:22:35,116
A high-security prison.

769
01:22:37,885 --> 01:22:38,973
MacLeod?

770
01:22:41,184 --> 01:22:43,273
Your time is now!

771
01:22:51,474 --> 01:22:53,445
<i>You have entered a restricted area.</i>

772
01:22:53,546 --> 01:22:55,640
<i>Please identify yourself immediately.</i>

773
01:22:55,748 --> 01:22:58,982
I am Juan Sanchez Villalobos Ramirez,

774
01:22:59,089 --> 01:23:01,889
chief metallurgist
to King Philip II of Spain,

775
01:23:01,994 --> 01:23:03,516
and I am at your service.

776
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:06,465
This is Checkpoint-1
outside of security installation Max.

777
01:23:06,566 --> 01:23:07,934
Identify yourselves.

778
01:23:08,036 --> 01:23:09,971
Hey, take it easy, man.

779
01:23:10,075 --> 01:23:11,805
First time in the desert.

780
01:23:11,911 --> 01:23:14,039
Which way to Vegas?

781
01:23:14,147 --> 01:23:16,617
Okay, jerkface.
Stay put and we'll come get you.

782
01:23:19,658 --> 01:23:20,649
Hit it, dude.

783
01:23:33,315 --> 01:23:34,474
Get ready.

784
01:23:34,583 --> 01:23:35,916
Here it comes.

785
01:24:28,545 --> 01:24:29,670
Hi.

786
01:24:29,779 --> 01:24:31,443
You won't shoot me, will you?

787
01:24:31,551 --> 01:24:33,745
I mean...

788
01:24:33,852 --> 01:24:35,981
Oh, thank you.

789
01:24:36,090 --> 01:24:38,823
I was just hitching a ride.

790
01:24:38,930 --> 01:24:42,299
And then these two guys grabbed me,
and, oh, my...

791
01:24:42,401 --> 01:24:44,631
And threw me in the trunk and...

792
01:24:44,738 --> 01:24:46,330
Oh, shit.

793
01:24:59,363 --> 01:25:03,360
Hello. I'm Dr. Sonny Jackson,
and I've looked over your report.

794
01:25:03,471 --> 01:25:05,669
As near as I can tell,
you have a few bruises and lacerations,

795
01:25:05,776 --> 01:25:07,504
but I think you'll be okay in a day or so.

796
01:25:07,612 --> 01:25:10,445
- Thanks. How about them?
- Oh, no way.

797
01:25:10,549 --> 01:25:12,486
They were both dead
before the car stopped.

798
01:25:12,587 --> 01:25:14,751
I'm amazed
they got as far as they did.

799
01:25:14,859 --> 01:25:16,724
Gosh, I've never seen
a mess like that.

800
01:25:16,826 --> 01:25:18,854
They must've taken about
100 bullets or so.

801
01:25:18,965 --> 01:25:20,294
Excuse me, 108.

802
01:25:20,401 --> 01:25:21,834
112, myself.

803
01:25:21,937 --> 01:25:24,871
Ah, come on. You're not counting
that little scratch, are you?

804
01:25:24,975 --> 01:25:27,571
Scratch?
What are you talking about?

805
01:25:27,678 --> 01:25:28,908
It passed right through me.

806
01:25:30,284 --> 01:25:31,773
Just look at my splendid waistcoat.

807
01:25:35,693 --> 01:25:38,063
Wait a minute.
You guys are... You boys are...

808
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:39,531
You guys are de...

809
01:25:39,633 --> 01:25:41,328
Wha... Larry?

810
01:26:19,836 --> 01:26:22,329
All right, these tunnels
run along both sides of Max,

811
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:23,908
and they end up at the same place.

812
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:26,204
They both have security rooms,
and Neyman's in one of them.

813
01:26:26,316 --> 01:26:28,876
So we should split up,
and we'll meet back together at the end.

814
01:26:28,986 --> 01:26:30,352
You take this way.
Let's go, MacLeod.

815
01:27:12,262 --> 01:27:14,664
No more. No more.
No more!

816
01:27:14,768 --> 01:27:15,735
Alan.

817
01:27:17,136 --> 01:27:19,130
Oh, my God.

818
01:27:19,241 --> 01:27:21,301
Eh, please.

819
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:23,910
Listen.

820
01:27:24,015 --> 01:27:29,320
Other coordinate: 6-degrees,
42-minutes, west.

821
01:27:29,425 --> 01:27:31,417
You can get through the shield there.

822
01:27:31,529 --> 01:27:34,260
You must see for yourself.

823
01:27:35,235 --> 01:27:36,759
- Mac?
- Yes.

824
01:27:38,506 --> 01:27:40,498
We did the right thing to build it.

825
01:27:43,081 --> 01:27:44,207
Yes, we did.

826
01:27:52,729 --> 01:27:55,528
<i>-  I won't forget you.
-  MacLeod.</i>

827
01:27:55,635 --> 01:27:57,196
How very touching.

828
01:27:57,306 --> 01:27:58,967
You don't have to worry.

829
01:27:59,075 --> 01:28:01,341
No one gets out of Max.

830
01:28:01,445 --> 01:28:04,350
But you said nobody
would get in, either.

831
01:28:06,255 --> 01:28:07,654
Who's that?

832
01:28:08,691 --> 01:28:11,059
Louise Marcus, the head of Cobalt.

833
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:14,498
A powerful enemy, I'm sure.

834
01:28:14,601 --> 01:28:16,800
Doesn't matter now,

835
01:28:16,905 --> 01:28:18,808
because they're both dead.

836
01:28:24,751 --> 01:28:26,848
Don't let the door close!

837
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:43,877
Holy shit!

838
01:29:07,225 --> 01:29:08,318
Just stay back.

839
01:29:08,429 --> 01:29:09,623
I can help!

840
01:29:09,730 --> 01:29:12,031
No, you can't. Not this time.

841
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,930
Most people have
a full measure of life.

842
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:39,380
And most people just watch it
slowly drip away.

843
01:29:46,329 --> 01:29:48,126
But if you can summon it all up...

844
01:29:50,134 --> 01:29:51,655
at one time...

845
01:29:53,975 --> 01:29:56,000
in one place...

846
01:30:00,584 --> 01:30:03,521
You can accomplish something

847
01:30:03,625 --> 01:30:05,183
glorious.

848
01:30:21,858 --> 01:30:23,186
My time here is over.

849
01:30:23,294 --> 01:30:24,519
You must go

850
01:30:24,626 --> 01:30:26,094
and search out Katana.

851
01:30:26,194 --> 01:30:29,531
It'll take the power of you both
to destroy the shield.

852
01:30:30,172 --> 01:30:31,602
Will I ever see you again?

853
01:30:31,705 --> 01:30:33,940
Who knows, Highlander?

854
01:30:34,044 --> 01:30:35,533
Who knows?

855
01:30:37,281 --> 01:30:38,749
Go.

856
01:31:05,438 --> 01:31:07,106
Show time.

857
01:31:15,375 --> 01:31:16,413
Come on.

858
01:31:29,138 --> 01:31:30,638
Outstanding!

859
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:57,322
Time for your bitch to die!

860
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,698
Whatever happens, don't stop.

861
01:32:00,817 --> 01:32:01,564
What?

862
01:32:35,198 --> 01:32:36,178
MacLeod!

863
01:32:45,592 --> 01:32:47,179
No!

864
01:33:28,795 --> 01:33:30,060
I'm fine.

865
01:33:30,176 --> 01:33:31,079
I'm fine!

866
01:33:40,167 --> 01:33:41,939
Oh, great.

867
01:34:09,864 --> 01:34:11,798
Let's go.

868
01:34:33,514 --> 01:34:34,581
MacLeod!

869
01:34:34,692 --> 01:34:36,042
MacLeod!

870
01:34:36,156 --> 01:34:38,023
Hold on!

871
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:39,641
That's it!

872
01:34:39,755 --> 01:34:41,067
Come on!

873
01:35:08,528 --> 01:35:12,009
Life is going to be quite predictable
without MacLeod.

874
01:35:18,707 --> 01:35:21,702
Aren't we getting
just a little overconfident,

875
01:35:21,806 --> 01:35:23,281
partner?

876
01:35:24,004 --> 01:35:25,774
You are betting on me,
aren't you?

877
01:35:25,875 --> 01:35:27,066
Oh, yes.

878
01:35:28,947 --> 01:35:31,622
You see,
I always play the favorite.

879
01:36:36,432 --> 01:36:37,898
Alan was right.

880
01:36:40,999 --> 01:36:42,338
The shield's got to come down.

881
01:36:44,599 --> 01:36:45,785
There is only one way.

882
01:36:54,848 --> 01:36:56,371
I haven't any idea where they are.

883
01:36:57,191 --> 01:36:59,591
I mean, for God's sake, they dropped off
the screen almost 24 hours ago.

884
01:37:01,130 --> 01:37:03,232
Everybody's got to be someplace.

885
01:37:04,396 --> 01:37:05,375
Relax.

886
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:07,626
At this point in his life,
he's a man with a mission.

887
01:37:08,677 --> 01:37:11,021
And all his roads lead to me.

888
01:37:11,685 --> 01:37:12,963
Right, I understand that.

889
01:37:14,245 --> 01:37:15,096
But I do beg to differ.

890
01:37:16,287 --> 01:37:18,193
What if he did get to Neyman
before he died,

891
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:21,636
and what if
he did get the coordinates?

892
01:37:22,006 --> 01:37:23,094
What of it?

893
01:37:23,957 --> 01:37:25,720
Well, just maybe, um,

894
01:37:26,866 --> 01:37:27,780
they could figure it out,

895
01:37:28,983 --> 01:37:30,173
about the ozone layer.

896
01:37:31,107 --> 01:37:34,431
And if that's the case,
well, suffice it to say

897
01:37:34,672 --> 01:37:36,696
the company would be spiraling
into chapter 11...

898
01:37:36,926 --> 01:37:38,127
Will you be quiet?

899
01:37:38,708 --> 01:37:39,654
It's MacLeod.

900
01:37:40,708 --> 01:37:42,709
It looks as though you fucked up,
eh, partner?

901
01:37:49,454 --> 01:37:50,804
You really think so?

902
01:37:51,274 --> 01:37:52,870
Well...

903
01:37:54,345 --> 01:37:55,669
Maybe...

904
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:12,692
Then again,

905
01:38:12,817 --> 01:38:15,036
maybe not.

906
01:38:37,685 --> 01:38:38,972
- Hi!
- Hi!

907
01:38:58,815 --> 01:39:00,427
Don't worry,
we're gonna be okay.

908
01:39:00,642 --> 01:39:01,449
That's easy for you to say.

909
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:02,805
You don't have to worry
about getting killed.

910
01:39:05,432 --> 01:39:06,404
We're gonna be okay.

911
01:39:08,464 --> 01:39:09,623
Just hold them off.

912
01:39:55,809 --> 01:39:57,041
That's very cute.

913
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:15,298
Come on!

914
01:41:41,585 --> 01:41:42,986
There can be only one.

915
01:42:26,752 --> 01:42:30,249
<i>It'll take the power of you both
to destroy the shield.</i>

916
01:42:50,152 --> 01:42:51,416
MacLeod!

917
01:44:06,773 --> 01:44:10,290
<i>Most people
have a full measure of life,</i>

918
01:44:10,396 --> 01:44:14,601
<i>and most people just
watch it slowly drip away.</i>

919
01:44:14,712 --> 01:44:17,110
<i>But if you can summon it all up</i>

920
01:44:17,221 --> 01:44:20,452
<i>at one time, in one place,</i>

921
01:44:20,566 --> 01:44:22,585
<i>you can accomplish something</i>

922
01:44:22,689 --> 01:44:24,186
<i>glorious.</i>
