00:11:26,741 --> 00:11:28,375
Ain't gonna take you
but a second, lady.

155
00:11:29,074 --> 00:11:30,905
Are you delivering something?

156
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:33,705
Yeah, employment papers.
I just gotta have somebody sign it.

157
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:35,805
It's gotta be, like,
a manager or the owner.

158
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,807
Is that you?

159
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,141
Nah, it ain't you.
Is that you, boss?

160
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,107
Yes.

161
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:43,104
Fantastic, man.
Just sign this for me, please.

162
00:11:43,106 --> 00:11:44,641
How would I sign it?

163
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,909
I don't know.

164
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,141
Slowly?

167
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,207
What? Don't your arms work?

168
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:55,974
- They don't.
- Damn.

169
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:57,872
What about you, sweetie?

170
00:11:57,874 --> 00:11:59,275
Why do you need a signature?

171
00:11:59,608 --> 00:12:02,375
I don't need a signature.
My PO needs a signature.

172
00:12:02,607 --> 00:12:05,038
As a matter of fact,

173
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,808
you should put your number down here
just in case she wanna phone or check in.

174
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:09,438
That way, it look like I did
what I said I was gonna do.

175
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,238
And if she asks, just say an extremely
attractive candidate came in here,

176
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,074
but y'all weren't lookin'
for a supermodel.

177
00:12:15,873 --> 00:12:17,439
I'm sorry, who might phone?

178
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:18,606
My PO.

179
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:20,641
- PO?
- His parole officer.

180
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,874
What's that look about?

181
00:12:23,273 --> 00:12:24,807
Don't judge me.
I ain't judged you.

182
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,973
Will you excuse us
for a moment, please?

185
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:37,441
No, I'm good.

186
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:39,938
So, you need a signature.
You don't need a job?

187
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,137
I need both.

188
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:42,407
Well, then have a seat.

189
00:12:43,473 --> 00:12:44,375

You're not allowed to ask me

00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:07,807
now that you asked me that question,
you gotta offer me the job.

200
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:13,808
Okay.

201
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:16,575
"Okay"?

00:13:18,073 --> 00:13:20,539
Okay,
I'm offering you the position.

203

What?
Philip, what are you doing?

204
00:13:23,374 --> 00:13:24,974
I'm offering him the position.

205
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,775
- So?
- <font color="#ffff00">[SCOFFS]</font>

206
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,907
I don't wanna be
your janitor, man.

207
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:35,307
Janitor? No, no. We're...
We're hiring a life auxiliary.

208
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,571
A what? What... What is that?

209
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:39,738
He doesn't even know what
he's applying for, Philip.

210
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,040
I need assistance.

211
00:13:41,906 --> 00:13:45,207
My arms don't work,
as you so astutely noted.

212
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:46,742
Nor do my legs.

213
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,375
I can only move my neck.

214
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:51,742
You can move your mouth.

215
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:53,707
As can you.

216
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:56,305
So, what's that mean?
I gotta...

217
00:13:56,307 --> 00:13:57,871
I gotta carry you around
or somethin'?

218
00:13:57,873 --> 00:13:59,870
You'd have to transfer me
to the chair,

219
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,040
to my bed, to the car.

220
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:04,771
There would be some travel,
if that interests you.

221
00:14:04,773 --> 00:14:05,742
It don't.

222
00:14:06,274 --> 00:14:07,638
Travel enough as it is.

223
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,274
It took me a hour
just to get here.

224
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:12,241
Uh-huh.

225
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,474
Okay. Uh...

226
00:14:14,973 --> 00:14:17,441
Look, I think your plantation
is bananas.

227
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:19,870
But unfortunately, I don't
wanna be nobody's servant.

228
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:22,104
So, how 'bout you just
sign my paperwork,

229
00:14:22,106 --> 00:14:23,904
and I'll think about
your offer, okay?

230
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,638
Well, we can't sign papers

231
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,305
saying that you're looking
for work

232
00:14:27,307 --> 00:14:29,808
if you're going to turn down
the work I offered.

233
00:14:30,274 --> 00:14:32,742
All right, I know you can't,
but how about your boo?

234
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,908
My boo?

235
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:41,308
- Yvonne is not my... my boo.
- No.

236
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,205
Are you, Yvonne?
Are you my boo?

237
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:44,438
- No, I'm not your boo.
- No.

238
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,071
All right. So listen,

239
00:14:46,073 --> 00:14:47,707
why don't you take the night
and think it over?

240
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:50,574
Come back tomorrow morning
ready for work,

241
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:52,771
or we'll sign the papers.

Why are you doing this?

249
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:09,972
Because it's what I want.

the candidates

that we've found already,

252
00:15:12,641 --> 00:15:14,238
then let's just keep looking.

253
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,072
I would be happy to assist

- in finding the perfect...
- No, I don't want your assistance.

not a nurse.

I know.

00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:25,873
I know that you do.

259
00:15:26,574 --> 00:15:29,372
But I hired you to manage
my affairs, not to...

Rush you to the hospital?

That's what this is about,
isn't it?

00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,372
You're asking me to leave.

313
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,240
- Because I can't count on you.
- What do you want from me?

314
00:18:48,939 --> 00:18:49,806
Hmm?

315
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,474
Now?

316
00:18:53,873 --> 00:18:54,908
Nothin'.

317
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:57,475
What did I want from you?

318
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,408
Everything.

319
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,571
Help, support.

320
00:19:04,573 --> 00:19:06,439
- I support you, Latrice.
- How?

321
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:08,041
- What do you mean, "How?"
- Where?

322
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,372
You never look out
for nobody but you, Dell.

323
00:19:11,374 --> 00:19:13,372
- That's not true.
- So, you take a good look at this

324
00:19:13,374 --> 00:19:15,471
falling apartment
you found us,

325
00:19:15,473 --> 00:19:19,771
and on your way out, you look at
that child I have raised by myself.

326
00:19:19,773 --> 00:19:22,741
You know what? You take a good,
hard look at these things,

327
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:25,641
- because you ain't gonna see 'em again.
- Yo, why don't you...

328
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:29,641
Goodbye, Dell.

329
00:19:31,107 --> 00:19:32,241

in the game, man.

All right.
Well, I can live with that.

362

Yes.

Yes, you do, Mr. Scott.

380
00:24:03,739 --> 00:24:05,641
But not for the reasons
you're implying.

381
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:09,208
As powerful
as Mr. LaCasse is...

382
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,774
he's a vulnerable man.

383
00:24:12,472 --> 00:24:15,641
So, does it scare me to think of him
in the wrong hands? Yes, it does.

384
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:18,937
Well, he don't seem to think these
the wrong hands. He picked 'em.

385
00:24:18,939 --> 00:24:20,270
And why do you think
he picked you?

386
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:21,773
Because I'm
the best candidate.

387
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,474
Because you were
the worst candidate.

388
00:24:25,305 --> 00:24:26,774
By far.

389
00:24:27,073 --> 00:24:28,570
Let's just call this what it is.
It's a game.

In this game,
you get three strikes.

391
00:24:30,107 --> 00:24:31,641
That's the agreement
I made with him.

392
00:24:31,973 --> 00:24:33,074
You know baseball?

393
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,774
- I do.
- So you my referee?

You been receiving these

Well, it's about a circle

1809
01:38:31,102 --> 01:38:32,966
that's missing
this pie-shaped piece.

1810
01:38:32,968 --> 01:38:34,701
And it goes on
a search for it.

1811
01:38:34,703 --> 01:38:38,600
It tries big pieces,
small pieces, broken pieces,

1812
01:38:38,602 --> 01:38:40,202
but none of them
let it roll right.

1813
01:38:40,568 --> 01:38:41,602
And then, one day...

1814
01:38:42,468 --> 01:38:43,537
there it is.

1815
01:38:43,902 --> 01:38:44,936
The perfect piece.

1816
01:38:46,136 --> 01:38:52,701
It picks it up and suddenly
it can go faster and faster.

1817
01:38:52,703 --> 01:38:53,737
It's free.

1818
01:38:57,603 --> 01:39:00,367
But after a while it realizes,

1819
01:39:00,369 --> 01:39:03,066
now it can't sing

1820
01:39:03,068 --> 01:39:06,536
or smell the flowers
or talk to its friends.

1821
01:39:07,702 --> 01:39:09,069
It was going too fast.

1822
01:39:15,034 --> 01:39:18,102
And in the end it decides to
leave the perfect piece behind.

1823
01:39:19,402 --> 01:39:22,634
Ooh. That's pretty deep,
for a children's book.

I read up quite a bit.

01:40:57,101 --> 01:40:58,902
I... I talked to people.

1850
01:41:00,901 --> 01:41:02,470
The librarian
did her homework.

To answer your question,
and it is a fair question,
