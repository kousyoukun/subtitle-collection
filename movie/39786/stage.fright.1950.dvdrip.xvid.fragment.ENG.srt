1
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,260
- 警察追来了吗?
- 不, 没有追来.

2
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:13,530
- 看起来好像我们摆脱他们了.
- 很好.

3
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:16,539
- 到你父亲的船那还有多远?
- 运气好的话两个小时.

4
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,405
你的运气似乎很好.

5
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,377
现在你能告诉我发生什么事了吗?
我真的很想知道.

6
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:23,879
如果你愿意说的话.

7
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,211
是夏洛特 因伍德.

8
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,988
- 她有麻烦了.
- 这并不让我感到惊讶.

9
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,020
不, 这次很严重, 伊芙.
非常严重.

10
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,216
她不知所措.
我必须帮她. 任何人都会这么做.

11
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,726
我当时在厨房. 大约5点钟.

12
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:40,832
门铃响了, 我下楼去看看是谁.

13
00:01:48,674 --> 00:01:52,337
强尼, 你爱我. 说你爱我. 你是爱我的, 对吗?

14
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:55,481
我想他死了. 我肯定他死了.

15
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,741
我不是故意的. 我不是故意的.

16
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,477
- 谁死了?
- 我丈夫.

17
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:03,747
我们大吵了一架  为了你.

18
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:07,290
噢, 他非常粗鲁.
你也知道他什么都说的出口.

19
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,260
他开始打我.
我抓起一样东西

20
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,923
我害怕得失去理智了.
Oh, what am I to do?

21
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:18,161
Darling, pull yourself together.
He may not be.

22
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:22,441
The curtains, Jonnie. Draw the curtains.

23
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,796
I thought I had some brandy.

24
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,094
Here, drink this.

25
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,169
He was an abominable man.

26
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,311
Why do women marry abominable men?

27
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,243
- Where was all this?
- In my bedroom.

28
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,384
- Anyone else in the house?
- I left the servants in the country.

29
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:08,748
I drove up early to have an hour's rest
before the performance.

30
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:12,652
Oh, what shall I do?
I can't go on. I can't.

31
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,259
- Has anyone seen you?
- No. I don't think so.

32
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:19,125
There wasn't a soul in the street.
I jumped into my car and came here.

33
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:20,959
It's parked around the corner.

34
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,466
Oh, Jonnie, what will they do to me?

35
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:26,833
Don't tremble like that. We'll find a way.
We'll see you're all right.

36
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,770
But you must call the theater.
I can't play tonight.

37
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:32,172
Tell them I'm ill.
Heavens, it'll be true enough.

38
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,677
No, you must go on tonight.
You've got to.

39
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,475
As if nothing had happened.
Nothing has happened.

40
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,210
You drove straight to the theater,
do you understand?

41
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,947
You haven't been home at all.
Now, get that into your head.

42
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:51,919
But my dress. There's blood on it.

43
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:55,067
- I must go back and change.
- No, you can't do that.

44
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,397
Or I could go myself.

45
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:02,501
Oh, darling, could you?
There's no one there.

46
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,199
I'd give you the key.

47
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,777
There's a blue dress like this
in the big cupboard...

48
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:09,471
...next to my window in the bedroom.
Here's the key.

49
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:13,642
- Are you sure the servants aren't back?
- No, but you must hurry. Oh, please, Jonnie.

50
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,047
This is my only chance.

51
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,314
- You will, won't you?
- It's a risk.

52
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,014
Let me think a minute. I mean...

53
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,717
Well, you know I want to help you, but...

54
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,591
Go or don't go. It's all the same.

55
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,892
I thought you loved me.

56
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,973
- Doesn't matter now.
- Oh, my dear. My darling.

57
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,944
I'd do anything for you. You know that.

58
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,950
I'll be as quick as I can.

59
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,402
It was your maid, Nellie.

60
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,872
Oh, yes.

61
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:02,912
She was going to the house to pick up
some shoes I need for the show.

62
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,843
- Did she recognize you?
- I don't know.

63
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:11,012
You ought to get to the theater. The police
are bound to go there to tell you the news.

64
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,782
Give me my belt, darling, will you?

65
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:20,597
Oh, Jonnie, what have I done to you?

66
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,667
If Nellie recognized you,
it won't be safe here.

67
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,532
- You ought to go away.
- I don't think that'll do much good.

68
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:29,435
But they'll come here.
You must go at once.

69
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:31,974
Oh, my dearest darling,
you have saved me.

70
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:35,807
We must think of you now.
You've got to hide.

71
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,883
What do I care what happens to me?

72
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,079
Your job is to try to forget everything.

73
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:47,089
Let me do the worrying. I'll find a way.

74
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,996
Then we'll start again,
won't we, you and I?

75
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:54,860
No more stealth and cheating and lying.

76
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,331
I must hurry, darling.
But I worry about you.

77
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,962
Well, you mustn't. You're an actress.
You're playing a part.

78
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,269
- No nerves when you're on.
- I'll try.

79
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:10,274
My dress!

80
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:13,516
- I'll get rid of that. Don't worry.
- Don't come down.

81
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,620
We shouldn't be seen together.

82
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,621
<i>- Au revoir</i>, my darling.
<i>- Au revoir</i>.

83
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,252
And for heaven's sake, don't worry.

84
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,209
- Yes?
- May I speak to Miss Eve Gill, please?

85
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,482
Oh, dear, no. I'm afraid she isn't in.

86
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,743
She was going for the weekend
to her father...

87
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,151
...but I thought she'd be back.
- Yes, that's right. She got back last night.

88
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:02,624
She's had rehearsals all day today
at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

89
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,990
You know, the RADA.

90
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,132
Do you know when she...?
Where she is now?

91
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,196
Didn't you hear?

92
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,860
She's at the RADA rehearsing.

93
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,435
- Jonathan Cooper?
- Yes.

94
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,240
We're police officers.
May we see you for a few minutes?

95
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,815
Most certainly. Please come in.

96
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,632
- Tell you that I can't possibly
accede to your request.

97
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,234
I've come to this decision after giving
the matter my earnest consideration.

98
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,136
Stop me if ever there was
such an ungrateful child!

99
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,937
No, darling. Don't run your words
into one another.

100
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,725
- The child most shamefully.

101
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,695
Is it not in your memory
that we, too, years ago...

102
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,665
...suffered the follies and fevers of youth?

103
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:01,033
If our blood runs cooler
and more temperate, let us not account...

104
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:05,267
...to ourselves for virtue, but place it
to the credit of the soothing balm...

105
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,345
...of the passage of years
that we have fortifications...

106
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,982
...against the distempers of juvenility.

107
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,714
You were wont to be kinder than this.

108
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,651
No, Papa, you are cruel.
If all parents were of your mind...

109
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:21,782
...marriage would be an impossibility. Then
what would become of the human race?

110
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,090
- Go away. What are you doing here?
- The police are after me. Do you see them?

111
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,392
You have not, I hope,
forgotten the tragedy...

112
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,434
They think I killed a man.
Can you hide me on your father's boat?

113
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:33,537
Are you so heartless as to wish...?

114
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:34,933
They've just gone.

115
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:39,232
I was under the impression that this
was a class of intelligent students...

116
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:42,209
...trying to master an extremely
difficult and beautiful art.

117
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:45,249
I haven't the pleasure of knowing you,
young man...

118
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,851
...but I shall report your behavior
to Sir Kenneth.

119
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,716
Now we will begin the rehearsal again,
with the other cast.

120
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:55,656
- This cast think acting is fun and games.
- I'm terribly sorry, Miss Ashton.

121
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,695
- Oh, Jonathan.
- Let's go. Have you got your car here?

122
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:03,062
It's parked in front. I'll show you
to the back entrance and pick you up there.

123
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,396
Eve, do you hate me...

124
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,938
...now that you know
about Charlotte and me?

125
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:12,909
Why, I could never hate you, Jonathan...

126
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:17,742
...because we're...
We're such old friends.

127
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,816
And...

128
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,215
Well, just because.

129
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:27,214
But I do wish I'd taken lessons
on the second fiddle.

130
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,221
Good old Eve.

131
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,124
Bring him in here.

132
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:08,356
It's warmer.

133
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,629
Do you think I behaved like a fool?

134
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,707
On the whole, I think so.

135
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,775
I think your boyfriend
has behaved like a fool.

136
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,913
I have a strong premonition
that I'm going to behave like a fool.

137
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,049
- It's infectious.
- Do you mean you're going to help him?

138
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,741
Why not?

139
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,319
He's a friend of yours, isn't he?

140
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,218
- Oh, yes.
- I see.

141
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,120
More than a friend, eh?

142
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,558
When I'm with him, I get a feeling
in here that... That's sort of...

143
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:39,720
Yes. Well, we'll go
into the symptoms later.

144
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:44,028
Meanwhile, I take it you're either
keen on him or still hungry.

145
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,361
I'm in love with him.

146
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:54,774
You've roped him, but he's not yet
broken to harness. Is that it?

147
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,344
I wish Charlotte Inwood was in...

148
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,278
Oh, do you?

149
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,045
I've seen her on the stage.

150
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:06,748
She'd have made me laugh,
if I hadn't been strictly on my guard.

151
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,393
Well, she couldn't make me laugh,
off or on the stage.

152
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:12,325
I can't bear to sit by and see
what she's doing to Jonathan.

153
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:14,692
She's like an evil spirit.
Just look at him!

154
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,198
Ruined, and by a woman.

155
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,262
Now you want me to take the ruins
for a little cruise.

156
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,273
- Well, is that it?
- I thought you could take him...

157
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,845
...across the channel or to the Irish coast.
Then he could hide out a bit.

158
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,039
The journey sounds attractive,
but less so...

159
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,743
...to help a suspected murderer to escape,
particularly with my reputation.

160
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,785
There's nothing wrong
with your reputation.

161
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,617
Oh, indeed.
I rather flattered myself that there was.

162
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,658
As a matter of fact, the customs people
have their eye on me.

163
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,887
I'm suspected of being a smuggler.

164
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:47,088
- Well, you're not.
- Oh, yes, I am.

165
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:49,859
One cask of brandy?
That doesn't mean you're a smuggler.

166
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,827
- Two casks.
- That was 15 years ago.

167
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:57,874
I've done one or two other things since
that I didn't tell you or your mother about.

168
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:02,036
- Can't have been very much.
- Of course not. Not very much.

169
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:05,911
Nothing could appear very much
to a murderer's moll.

170
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:08,118
But I never hope to be appreciated.

171
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:10,311
Yes, your mother cured me of that.

172
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,980
That's why I never could be bothered
with your mother.

173
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:17,924
I appreciate you, Father. You and
Captain Kidd are my favorite heroes.

174
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,763
My child, I am not deceived.

175
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:26,131
If there's one thing I cannot bear,
it's insincerity.

176
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,338
But you've got to help him.
You will help him, won't you?

177
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:33,467
He's lonely. He hasn't got any friends
but me, and maybe you.

178
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,773
- You will help him, won't you?
- He hasn't got me...

179
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:38,279
...yet.

180
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:44,082
You're just dying to get into a part of this,
and you know you are.

181
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,816
A part in this melodramatic play,
you mean?

182
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,789
That's the way you're treating it, Eve.

183
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,758
As though it were a play
you were acting in at the Academy.

184
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,798
Everything seems a fine acting role
when you're stage-struck...

185
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:57,730
...doesn't it, my dear?

186
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:01,361
Here you have a plot,
an interesting cast...

187
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,499
...even a costume,
little the worse for wear.

188
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,238
Unfortunately, Eve,
in this real and earnest life...

189
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,906
...we must face the situation
and all its bearings.

190
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,847
Yes.

191
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:16,815
What do you mean?

192
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:21,254
Well, Miss Charlotte Inwood
appears to be an expert in garden paths.

193
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,452
I think she's led your young friend
up the garden path.

194
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:26,995
I think we should hesitate
before we follow him.

195
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:29,258
- But why?
- I don't know how this bloodstain...

196
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:33,495
...got onto this dress, but I do know that
somebody smeared it on deliberately.

197
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,162
But why should they do that?

198
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,798
Well, Miss Inwood is an actress,
a very good one.

199
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,275
She has an eye
for an emotional situation.

200
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,677
Supposing she wanted our somnolent
young friend to go to her house...

201
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,283
...and be spotted there.

202
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:50,410
Well, this sanguinary garment
would provide a very plausible reason.

203
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,080
A very plausible reason indeed.

204
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,716
So that's why she didn't change her dress
before she went to his rooms.

205
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,955
Well, I cannot imagine Miss Inwood
going to see her young man...

206
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:03,624
Or your young man, whose ever young man
he is, in this nasty, messy condition.

207
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:07,533
No. This dress is a clue, my dear,
a very important clue.

208
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,732
And though it grieves me, of all people,
to have to say it, Eve...

209
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,343
...I think we should go to the police.

210
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,405
Jonathan! Jonathan, wake up.

211
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,177
Jonathan, how far do you think
you could trust Charlotte?

212
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,651
I'd trust her with my life.
What do you mean?

213
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:26,256
This bloodstain was put here deliberately.

214
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:30,155
Don't be ridiculous. You're trying to turn me
against Charlotte, but you can't.

215
00:20:30,328 --> 00:20:33,764
What's this doing here, anyhow?
It should have been destroyed hours ago!

216
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,457
Fool! There goes the evidence
that could've helped you.

217
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,763
I'm doing all this for Charlotte's sake.
You're just jealous of her!

218
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,338
Young man, I'd remind you
you're my daughter's guest.

219
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,031
I'd like better manners from you.

220
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,074
Oh, I am sorry, Eve.

221
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,075
Please forgive me.

222
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:50,544
I lost my head for a moment.

223
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:54,173
I can hardly think.
I'm almost dead for want of sleep.

224
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,355
I wonder, would it be too much trouble
if I went to bed?

225
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:00,582
That is, if Commodore Gill
wants to let me stay.

226
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:06,222
Your room is at the head of the stairs.
You'll be quite comfortable.

227
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,366
And if you want anything to read in bed...

228
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,331
...you'll find some quite good
murder mysteries in there.

229
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,232
Beg your pardon.

230
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,508
Look, Eve...

231
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,408
But he's just gone...

232
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:50,400
At last we are alone and unobserved.
You know, I'm beginning to enjoy this.

233
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,635
Father, do you think she arranged
to put the suspicion on Jonathan?

234
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,304
- Do you think she deliberately framed him?
- The thought had crossed my mind.

235
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:01,475
That was why I reluctantly suggested that
our friends, the police, ought to be told.

236
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,486
But it's too late. Our only evidence
has gone up the chimney.

237
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,988
But we must help him.
He'll do nothing for himself.

238
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:10,559
He's hopelessly in love with that woman.
It's up to us.

239
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,390
Yes, but it won't be easy.

240
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,933
It is easy.
I'll go to her and see her myself.

241
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,628
- Would that be wise?
- But I don't care if it is or not.

242
00:22:20,805 --> 00:22:25,299
I'll tell her we know how the bloodstain got
on the dress and every move of her game.

243
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:28,474
I'll make her talk.
It'll be one woman to another.

244
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,638
An impressive situation at any time.

245
00:22:30,815 --> 00:22:33,579
She won't be able to help
but give herself away. You'll see.

246
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,880
I won't see. I won't be there,
and neither will you.

247
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,649
If we're right in what we think,
she's a dangerous woman.

248
00:22:39,824 --> 00:22:42,418
She won't give herself away.
You'd be giving her an alternative.

249
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,892
She has no alternative.

250
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,397
She might murder you.

251
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:51,697
Oh, don't be so melodramatic, Father.

252
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,634
Look, my love. Face facts.

253
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,472
What is the least that can happen to you
if you tackle this remarkable lady?

254
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:03,239
She'll at once pick up a little pink
telephone and call the police.

255
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:07,408
She will then give you in charge
for concealing a fugitive from justice.

256
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:10,076
Eventually, you will be tried
at the Old Bailey.

257
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:14,248
Well, if you're lucky, you might get off
with, now, let me see...

258
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:17,918
...a couple of years, which you will spend
in Holloway prison...

259
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:21,930
...meditating on the folly of transmuting
melodrama into real life.

260
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:24,357
Well...

261
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,903
The best thing you can do, my girl,
is to go back to your Academy...

262
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,065
...and practice your soul-shaking antics...

263
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:33,938
...in surroundings where
they can't do any harm.

264
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:37,878
After all, this fellow can't possibly
mean all that to you.

265
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,151
But he does, Father.

266
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,547
- Move along, please.
- But I'd like...

267
00:25:25,723 --> 00:25:28,191
Now move along, ma'am.
This is nothing to see.

268
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:37,697
Hello, Father?
I'm outside the Inwood house.

269
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,894
Outside? Why not inside?

270
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:43,404
Don't be ridiculous, Father.
The police won't let anyone near the place.

271
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:46,976
Really? How very extraordinary.

272
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,238
Look, you've done your best.
Come back here...

273
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:52,008
...and decide about the man
that came to dinner.

274
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:56,247
Oh, I feel awful. I've been listening
to the people in the crowd talking...

275
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:59,618
...and they assume that
you-know-who is guilty...

276
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:03,022
...and all the police have to do
is catch him. It's terrifying.

277
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:05,287
Yes, but the police may not
think he's guilty.

278
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:07,431
After all, they work in secret, you know.

279
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,659
They may have their own ideas
about a certain lady.

280
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,460
I wish I knew what
the police were thinking.

281
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:18,906
- Well, look, why not ask them?
- Well, that's easier said than done.

282
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,039
Oh, just a minute, Father.

283
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:26,311
- Father, goodbye now.
- Eve...

284
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:36,024
I'll see you back at the office
about 2:00, sir.

285
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:27,144
May I have a small brandy, please?

286
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:31,547
Madam. Pardon my intrusion,
but is there, by any chance...

287
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:35,709
...any assistance I could be of?
- No, thank you.

288
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:46,989
- I don't know how you pick up all the dirt.
- Oh, I get around.

289
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,032
Any case, I know Munson's...

290
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:56,135
Right from the horse's mouth.

291
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,179
I most solemnly assure you, madam...

292
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,944
...it would be a pleasure, if there was
any assistance I could be of.

293
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,416
Thank you very much.

294
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:14,154
If you will allow me to say so,
you look depressed.

295
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:17,886
Yes, the cheering word,
the helping hand...

296
00:28:18,062 --> 00:28:20,257
I'm perfectly all right.

297
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,597
Oh, good. Right. Good, good.

298
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,381
Is there anything I can do?

299
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:42,246
Look, I don't know your trouble,
but you don't look very well to me.

300
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,186
A little brandy can't do you any harm.
Why not drink it?

301
00:28:54,932 --> 00:28:58,698
My great-aunt died over a glass of brandy,
but it was her 15th that day.

302
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,338
- Feeling any better?
- Yes, thank you.

303
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:02,939
You left your lunch over there.

304
00:29:03,107 --> 00:29:05,507
It won't feel lonely.
I'll go back to it in a minute.

305
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,474
Perhaps you're allergic to bars.
Look...

306
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,170
...would you feel less uneasy
if I sat with you, or more so?

307
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:13,545
- Perhaps you're allergic to strange men too.
- No. I love strange men.

308
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:18,121
- I mean, I'm very fond of them.
- I'll just go and get my lunch.

309
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:24,721
The butler told me. Never saw such a sight.
They say his head was bashed in.

310
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:28,127
I heard they clocked him so hard his
false teeth went across the room.

311
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:31,700
I know I'm pretty silly, but I overheard
two people on the street today...

312
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:33,860
...talking about the murder.

313
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,506
They went into a lot of detail.

314
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:40,309
I felt so sick and giddy,
I just had to come in and have a brandy.

315
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:43,140
My father says I tend
to overdramatize everything.

316
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,806
I expect he's right. I know how you feel,
though. I hate violence myself.

317
00:29:46,984 --> 00:29:49,817
Doesn't that make it
rather difficult for you?

318
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:54,720
I mean, I think we ought to face up
to the ugly side of life.

319
00:29:54,892 --> 00:29:58,089
Now, me, for instance.
I'm an actress.

320
00:29:58,262 --> 00:30:01,527
I ought to face up to all sorts
of experiences, oughtn't I?

321
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:05,601
Oh, I don't know. Supposing I happened
to be a librarian.

322
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:10,173
A librarian doesn't encounter much violence
except an occasional encyclopedia falling.

323
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,605
But you're not a librarian, are you?

324
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,802
No, I'm not. How do you know?

325
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:18,308
Well, you just don't
look like a librarian.

326
00:30:19,183 --> 00:30:22,846
- You don't look like an actress.
- Oh? I thought I did.

327
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:29,823
Well, I'm only a beginner, really.
That is, I've only played one part in public.

328
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,686
- Could I have seen you?
- I don't think so.

329
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:36,800
It was in the church hall.
I played the fourth deadly sin.

330
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,501
- Were you good?
- I was pretty deadly.

331
00:30:41,672 --> 00:30:43,333
What was this Jonathan Cooper after?

332
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:47,638
- I heard there was nothing stolen.
- Perhaps he did it for the fun of it...

333
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,040
Poor Charlotte Inwood.

334
00:30:49,213 --> 00:30:52,011
Imagine coming home and finding
your husband horribly dead...

335
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,084
...policemen and detectives
all over the house, and the blood...

336
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:56,481
Careful, careful.

337
00:30:56,654 --> 00:31:01,023
Remember, you're sensitive to that sort
of thing. You'll bring on another fainting fit.

338
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:04,784
I hear that Charlotte Inwood's going back
into the show in a couple of days.

339
00:31:04,962 --> 00:31:06,827
Must be dreadful to sing and dance...

340
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,660
...with that horrible picture
still burning in one's mind.

341
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:14,396
Oh, it's the old story, "Is not the actor
the man with a heart?" all over again.

342
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:16,938
I once had a cousin
who had a duodenal ulcer...

343
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,576
...and an extremely funny face,
both at the same time.

344
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:22,076
Everybody laughed
when he was telling his symptoms.

345
00:31:22,246 --> 00:31:23,611
His name was Jim.

346
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,578
That must have been terrible.

347
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,412
Oh, I don't know.
Jim's quite a common name.

348
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:33,354
I wonder what Charlotte Inwood
is really like. Really, I mean.

349
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:36,049
- Oh, hello, Nellie.
- That's Charlotte Inwood's maid.

350
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,235
Hello, Nellie. I didn't expect
to see you so soon.

351
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,428
How are you bearing up after last night?

352
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,267
Mrs. Tippet, what I've been through.
All those policemen.

353
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,375
Bothering you with a lot of questions.

354
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:55,944
Questions? They've been asking me this,
asking me that, all morning long.

355
00:31:56,113 --> 00:31:58,104
I didn't know whether
I was coming or going.

356
00:31:58,282 --> 00:31:59,874
Gin and lemon, please, Mrs. Tippet.

357
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,643
- Not too much lemon, dear.
- Okay.

358
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:06,722
Mind you, they never laid a finger on me,
but, oh, the questions. Nag, nag, nag.

359
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:10,349
"How did you know it was Mr. Cooper?
How many times you seen him and where?

360
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:13,588
And did he give you anything?"
Blimey, he never gave me nothing.

361
00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:15,664
"And how long you been
Miss Inwood's maid?"

362
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,994
They was gentlemanly and polite,
all right...

363
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,569
...but give me the bleeding Russians
any day, dear.

364
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:23,707
Yes. You gotta watch your step
when you're up against the police.

365
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,343
If that wasn't enough,
when I came out of the house...

366
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,002
...the reporters pounced on me with their
questions, asking me the lowdown.

367
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:33,378
I just jumped out of my skin when that
photographer's flashbulb went.

368
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:36,179
Well, I mean, fancy taking my picture.

369
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:40,814
You're quite a celebrity, you lucky girl.
I'll have to buy the <i>Daily Mirror</i> tomorrow.

370
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:44,985
Of course, I'm not saying a word
to the reporters. Not a word.

371
00:32:45,162 --> 00:32:48,654
After all, who discovered the body?

372
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:52,599
I'll be a star witness at that trial, and my
story ought to be worth something...

373
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,034
...and I've no intention of giving it away.

374
00:32:55,206 --> 00:33:00,838
- Isn't she talking too much?
- Too much, too loud, too everything.

375
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:02,912
How do you feel now?

376
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,516
Oh, I feel a little better, thank you.

377
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,151
I have to go.

378
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,980
I don't like leaving you here alone.

379
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,247
Do you feel fit enough
to let me see you home?

380
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:15,449
- I have a car.
- Perhaps you'd better let me drive it for you.

381
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:19,118
Well, that's very kind of you.
I do still feel a bit wobbly.

382
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:23,199
To be quite honest, it isn't kindness at all.
I mean, I'm afraid I maneuvered it.

383
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,661
How clever of you.

384
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:29,169
You've got something there, Fred.
I'll drink to that, on you.

385
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,706
A double gin and lemon, please.

386
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,677
Double? All right, Nellie,
I hope it chokes you.

387
00:33:35,846 --> 00:33:39,282
You don't miss a trick, do you?
You're always on the make.

388
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:54,424
My mother's really a dear. My father, too,
but they shout at one another...

389
00:33:54,598 --> 00:33:56,361
...and neither one like to shout.

390
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,593
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this.

391
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:02,170
You've been extraordinarily kind and
you know nothing whatsoever about me.

392
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,403
Oh, I don't know, Miss Gill.

393
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:07,510
You were born in South Africa.
The 17th of September, wasn't it?

394
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:11,239
Educated in America and you're studying
at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

395
00:34:11,415 --> 00:34:13,076
Your parents don't live together.

396
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:17,186
You're a very well-behaved lady, but allergic
to murder, and that drove you to drink.

397
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:18,583
I hope it's only temporary.

398
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,019
But I don't even know your name.

399
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:22,921
I only know that you play the piano.

400
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:26,894
I'm so sorry. It was stupid of me.
I forgot. My name is Smith.

401
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,693
Just ordinary Smith?

402
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:41,208
A detective?

403
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:43,445
I hope you don't mind.

404
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,273
Oh, no. Of course not.

405
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,211
Well, I'm delighted.

406
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:52,117
By the way, I don't suppose you and
your mother are interested in tea...

407
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:53,620
...with a detective, that is.

408
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:57,092
Of course. Especially with a detective.

409
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:01,129
- Would you like to have tea with us?
- Oh, I'd love to. How about this afternoon?

410
00:35:01,298 --> 00:35:03,960
- Well, tomorrow, then?
- Yes.

411
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,601
Yes. That's fine.

412
00:35:29,493 --> 00:35:32,053
And I could take your place.

413
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:35,594
You'd never get away with it. What
makes you think you could be a maid?

414
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:37,358
It would only be for a day or two.

415
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:39,833
You'd have to be her dresser
down at the theater.

416
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,905
You couldn't do that.
That's very highly skilled work.

417
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:45,736
- Well, I could if you told me how.
- It sounds phony to me.

418
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,674
All this trouble just to get
a newspaper story.

419
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:51,974
Well, we women reporters have
a tough job competing with the men...

420
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:54,276
...especially on
important stories like this.

421
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,716
And what paper are you on, may I ask?

422
00:35:56,887 --> 00:35:59,117
Well, I can't tell you that.

423
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:02,589
If anything should go wrong,
it would be embarrassing for the paper.

424
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,523
Oh? And what about my job?

425
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:07,823
Suppose Miss Inwood found out
I was passing you off as my cousin.

426
00:36:07,998 --> 00:36:09,761
I'm not sure she won't smell a rat.

427
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:11,629
I never been away ill for years.

428
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:15,135
But anyone could go sick.
And I could do it, really I could.

429
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:18,002
I've... I've done a bit of acting.

430
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:20,109
Character acting?

431
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,306
- Yes.
- I see.

432
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,473
All you gotta do is put on some old clothes
and make yourself look common like me.

433
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:30,142
Let me explain why it's so important
that I get the right slant on this.

434
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:33,882
I think there's a romance between
Miss Inwood and this man named Cooper.

435
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:37,050
And where did you get this idea?
Do you know what I think?

436
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:39,594
- I think you're snooping for the police.
- Oh, no...

437
00:36:39,763 --> 00:36:42,926
I saw you this morning sitting
on this very seat with a detective.

438
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,565
Oh, well, that was Wilfred Smith.

439
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:50,104
He's an old friend of mine.
I didn't get a thing out of him.

440
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,299
Charlie, double gin and lemon, please.

441
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,639
- Not too much lemon, dear.
- Same for me.

442
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:01,248
I can get five times that much
from any newspaper when the case is over.

443
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,347
Why not get both?

444
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:04,882
Caught you, have I?

445
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:08,616
Hope I don't intrude
on some deep conspiracy.

446
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:13,729
And I hope you find yourself no worse
for your distressing experiences.

447
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:18,398
Haven't I met your charming
friend before? I know that face.

448
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,964
This is my cousin Doris, Mr. Fortesque.

449
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,573
Oh, yeah. Charming. Charming.

450
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:28,735
Perhaps as dear Nellie didn't
provide me with your surname...

451
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,381
...you'll let me call you Doris, eh?

452
00:39:05,575 --> 00:39:10,035
Mrs. Mason, I can't think what I've done
with my reading glasses.

453
00:39:10,213 --> 00:39:13,114
Have you seen them anywhere?

454
00:39:37,373 --> 00:39:38,897
- Could l...?
- Oh, there you are.

455
00:39:39,075 --> 00:39:43,444
Help me find my glasses, Eve, darling.
I can't see a thing.

456
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,748
I'm Doris Tinsdale.

457
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,354
I'm from Nellie.

458
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:06,366
Move along there, please.

459
00:40:11,641 --> 00:40:13,165
I'm Doris Tinsdale.

460
00:40:13,343 --> 00:40:15,072
- Miss Inwood's expecting me.
- Oh, yes.

461
00:40:15,244 --> 00:40:18,145
You're the temporary Nellie sent along.

462
00:40:26,622 --> 00:40:29,090
Just wait over here a minute.

463
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:39,296
We'd like to see Miss Inwood.
Can I have a few words with you as well?

464
00:40:39,469 --> 00:40:41,733
By all means.
Will you step this way, please?

465
00:40:41,904 --> 00:40:44,839
I understand you've been in service
now for six or seven years.

466
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:49,000
Six years and nine months,
to be precise...

467
00:40:49,178 --> 00:40:50,907
Come in.

468
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:56,447
Okay, yes. I'll come around
the box office tonight.

469
00:40:57,053 --> 00:41:00,022
- What did they say, Freddie?
- More cancellations.

470
00:41:00,189 --> 00:41:01,747
Oh, how stupid people are.

471
00:41:01,924 --> 00:41:04,654
Even if my understudy's legs
are so peculiar...

472
00:41:04,827 --> 00:41:06,920
...she's just as good as I am.

473
00:41:07,096 --> 00:41:10,293
She knows darn well she'd better not be.
That's not the point.

474
00:41:10,466 --> 00:41:12,866
It's you they want to see.

475
00:41:13,403 --> 00:41:16,566
- Well, what do you want?
- I'm from Nellie.

476
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:18,036
Madam's expecting me.

477
00:41:18,574 --> 00:41:21,008
The new girl's here, Charlie.

478
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,618
No, no. This doesn't fit me.

479
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:39,189
Here, here. Pull it up on this side.
The other side too.

480
00:41:39,362 --> 00:41:41,557
You know that, don't you?

481
00:41:42,799 --> 00:41:44,596
Excuse me, madam.

482
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:47,099
Read it to me, dear.

483
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:55,139
"Dear Madam, this will introduce
my cousin Doris...

484
00:41:55,311 --> 00:41:56,972
...who is in every way a good girl."

485
00:41:57,146 --> 00:41:59,341
Not so loud.

486
00:41:59,649 --> 00:42:03,415
"I hope you'll find her satisfactory
during my illness. Signed, Nellie Goode."

487
00:42:03,586 --> 00:42:06,612
This is very nice,
if you can call mourning nice...

488
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:13,319
...but isn't there some way we could let it
plunge a little in front? I suppose not.

489
00:42:13,729 --> 00:42:15,026
"Signed, Nellie Goode."

490
00:42:15,198 --> 00:42:19,498
If we could only work in a little
color somewhere. Oh, well.

491
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:22,064
"Signed, Nellie Goode."

492
00:42:22,472 --> 00:42:24,099
Take off your hat, dear.

493
00:42:24,273 --> 00:42:26,901
There are simply millions
of things to do, I'm afraid.

494
00:42:27,176 --> 00:42:29,440
You won't mind if I depend
on you a great deal?

495
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:31,403
Thank you, darling.

496
00:42:31,647 --> 00:42:35,139
Now, get me out of these weeds.
I'm beginning to feel sad, and I shouldn't.

497
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:37,650
It's so depressing.

498
00:42:38,087 --> 00:42:39,952
See who that is.

499
00:42:40,556 --> 00:42:42,046
What's your name?

500
00:42:42,225 --> 00:42:44,989
Doris Tinsdale, madam.

501
00:42:53,336 --> 00:42:54,735
Yes? What is it, Groves?

502
00:42:54,904 --> 00:42:56,838
Divisional Detective Inspector Byard...

503
00:42:57,006 --> 00:42:59,372
...and Detective Inspector Smith
to see you, madam.

504
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:01,032
Good heavens.

505
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:03,474
Hear that, Freddie? The police again.

506
00:43:03,646 --> 00:43:06,240
- Show them up, Groves.
- Very good, madam.

507
00:43:06,415 --> 00:43:09,509
I thought I told you to wait downstairs.

508
00:43:10,186 --> 00:43:14,350
Hand me a negligee from that cupboard
over there, will you, Phyllis?

509
00:43:14,891 --> 00:43:19,328
Now, what about this dress for
the theatrical garden party, Miss Inwood?

510
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:22,930
Black? Oh, yes, of course.

511
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:25,260
How clever of you to remember, darling.

512
00:43:25,434 --> 00:43:27,629
Hold that for me, will you?

513
00:43:29,672 --> 00:43:31,640
- Freddie.
- Yes?

514
00:43:31,807 --> 00:43:34,867
We haven't decided. Am I going
to the theatrical garden party?

515
00:43:35,044 --> 00:43:36,841
I don't feel an atom like it.

516
00:43:37,013 --> 00:43:39,743
I keep thinking about those
dreadful cancellations.

517
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:41,941
I don't see why.
They're a compliment to you.

518
00:43:42,118 --> 00:43:44,848
Hand me a comb and mirror
from over there, will you?

519
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:47,387
But they do cut down the takings.

520
00:43:47,557 --> 00:43:51,254
I think I could appear tonight,
if you insisted.

521
00:43:51,427 --> 00:43:53,327
Wouldn't it be a terrible strain for you?

522
00:43:53,496 --> 00:43:55,862
Oh, ghastly.

523
00:43:56,032 --> 00:44:00,662
But I can't help feel
for my poor, dear, loyal public.

524
00:44:00,836 --> 00:44:03,066
Looking towards it for weeks...

525
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:06,675
...and then trailing back sadly
with their tickets...

526
00:44:06,842 --> 00:44:10,278
...getting their money returned.
I simply can't bear it.

527
00:44:10,446 --> 00:44:12,311
It would be pretty trying.

528
00:44:12,481 --> 00:44:14,540
Waves of sympathy coming on the stage...

529
00:44:14,717 --> 00:44:17,015
...all the gangways flooded with tears.

530
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,350
I can hardly bear the thought myself.

531
00:44:20,523 --> 00:44:23,822
No use trying to stop me.
I'm going on tonight.

532
00:44:23,993 --> 00:44:25,984
Be at the theater at 6:00 sharp, will you?

533
00:44:26,162 --> 00:44:29,029
- Yes, madam.
- Take this away.

534
00:44:30,232 --> 00:44:33,360
You go right ahead, dear.
Garden party dress and everything.

535
00:44:33,536 --> 00:44:38,633
And why don't we let ourselves
go a trifle just in front, huh?

536
00:44:38,808 --> 00:44:41,402
And thank you so very much.

537
00:44:44,981 --> 00:44:47,916
What do you suppose
the police wants now?

538
00:44:48,084 --> 00:44:49,312
I don't know.

539
00:44:49,485 --> 00:44:51,385
Must you speak to me
with your mouth full?

540
00:44:51,554 --> 00:44:54,682
They've probably come to look under
your bed for Master Cooper.

541
00:44:55,257 --> 00:44:58,715
What could I tell them about Cooper?
I know nothing about him.

542
00:44:58,894 --> 00:45:00,555
Tell them just that.

543
00:45:00,963 --> 00:45:02,521
Listen.

544
00:45:05,201 --> 00:45:07,192
That's a good idea.

545
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:08,867
Elsie, darling, come here.

546
00:45:11,107 --> 00:45:13,735
Now, I want you to wait
in the other room and listen.

547
00:45:13,909 --> 00:45:17,140
When you hear me cough, you come
in and say, "The doctor's here."

548
00:45:17,313 --> 00:45:18,541
Yes, madam.

549
00:45:18,714 --> 00:45:20,614
You can stand just so much of detectives.

550
00:45:20,783 --> 00:45:23,183
After all, they are only policemen
with smaller feet.

551
00:45:30,092 --> 00:45:32,424
- In here?
- The next door, sir.

552
00:45:33,462 --> 00:45:35,327
What's the matter with Nellie?

553
00:45:35,498 --> 00:45:39,059
Oh, it's her stomach, sir,
if you'll excuse the expression.

554
00:45:39,235 --> 00:45:41,601
The tragedy and excitement
was too much for her.

555
00:45:41,771 --> 00:45:44,239
- Highly strung type, eh?
- Oh, very, sir.

556
00:45:44,607 --> 00:45:47,804
I suppose you know, Miss Inwood,
that whatever Cooper's motive was...

557
00:45:47,977 --> 00:45:50,070
...it certainly couldn't have been robbery.

558
00:45:50,246 --> 00:45:52,771
Of course, darling. I understand that.

559
00:45:53,149 --> 00:45:55,982
I suppose he just tried
to make it look like robbery.

560
00:45:56,152 --> 00:45:58,211
What's your name again?

561
00:45:58,854 --> 00:46:02,017
- Doris, sir.
- You know, Doris, you're not bad-looking.

562
00:46:02,191 --> 00:46:05,319
- Thank you, sir.
- You don't treat your face properly.

563
00:46:05,494 --> 00:46:08,657
If you fixed your hair and used makeup,
you'd be quite attractive.

564
00:46:08,831 --> 00:46:11,698
I suppose I shouldn't have seen him
as often as I did.

565
00:46:11,867 --> 00:46:15,428
But I didn't realize how madly
infatuated he was with me.

566
00:46:16,038 --> 00:46:17,903
I just didn't realize.

567
00:46:18,174 --> 00:46:22,110
You'll never know how much
I blame myself for all this.

568
00:46:22,344 --> 00:46:24,744
When my husband came back
from New York last week...

569
00:46:24,914 --> 00:46:26,882
...and I told Jonnie I couldn't see him...

570
00:46:27,049 --> 00:46:28,573
...he kept on phoning me.

571
00:46:28,751 --> 00:46:30,582
He wouldn't let me alone.

572
00:46:30,753 --> 00:46:33,085
Oh, maybe if I had agreed to see him...

573
00:46:33,255 --> 00:46:35,348
...he wouldn't have done
this dreadful thing.

574
00:46:35,524 --> 00:46:39,688
- When did you last see Jonathan Cooper?
- Let me think.

575
00:46:39,862 --> 00:46:42,296
It must have been a week...

576
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:44,456
A week before my husband died.

577
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:51,097
- Go on. What are you waiting for?
- Did he come to this house?

578
00:46:53,008 --> 00:46:56,341
Excuse me, madam.
The doctor's waiting to see you.

579
00:46:56,512 --> 00:46:59,447
Oh, I'm so sorry, darling,
but I will have to see my doctor.

580
00:46:59,615 --> 00:47:03,449
I'm feeling wretched.
I've been trying to get him all morning.

581
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:05,849
You see, I'm going on tonight.

582
00:47:06,021 --> 00:47:08,148
The producer has insisted so much.

583
00:47:08,324 --> 00:47:10,554
And I don't want to see him
ruined because of me.

584
00:47:10,726 --> 00:47:13,422
That's all right. I think
we've covered most of the points.

585
00:47:13,596 --> 00:47:16,588
If there's any more I can help you with,
you will let me know?

586
00:47:16,766 --> 00:47:19,462
Thank you. We'll try not
to trouble you again.

587
00:47:19,635 --> 00:47:20,863
Thank you.

588
00:47:21,036 --> 00:47:23,266
You're so understanding.

589
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,971
And so are you.

590
00:47:26,242 --> 00:47:28,369
Doris, show the gentlemen out.

591
00:47:28,544 --> 00:47:32,002
It's all right, thank you. We can
find our own way downstairs.

592
00:47:33,749 --> 00:47:35,649
Freddie.

593
00:47:36,919 --> 00:47:39,251
Mavis, go to the kitchen
and get yourself some tea.

594
00:47:39,421 --> 00:47:42,515
- I'll ring when I need you.
- Yes. Thank you, madam.

595
00:48:28,204 --> 00:48:30,764
- Darling, where is Jonathan?
- Friends may be hiding him.

596
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:32,202
He had no friends, only me.

597
00:48:32,374 --> 00:48:35,537
I hope he hasn't made any and hasn't
taken them into his confidence.

598
00:48:35,711 --> 00:48:37,576
For your sake, his sake and their sake.

599
00:48:37,746 --> 00:48:40,738
- What do you mean?
- Lf the truth comes out, it would break you.

600
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:42,850
- I can't have that.
- What could you do?

601
00:48:43,018 --> 00:48:46,181
You know me.
You know how it is with me.

602
00:48:49,024 --> 00:48:53,017
- You make me afraid.
- Not I. You don't know what fear is.

603
00:48:56,866 --> 00:48:58,424
Oh, that would be most lovely.

604
00:48:58,601 --> 00:49:00,466
Of course,
you must be fond of swimming.

605
00:49:00,636 --> 00:49:02,604
But I am, yes I am,
very fond of it.

606
00:49:02,771 --> 00:49:04,705
I go out to the country
to find somewhere to swim.

607
00:49:04,874 --> 00:49:06,842
You don't live in the country? Oh, dear.

608
00:49:07,009 --> 00:49:11,412
Of course, we miss the rain so much, don't
we? All the flowers. It's so disappointing.

609
00:49:12,581 --> 00:49:15,345
I really must apologize for Eve, Mr...?

610
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:17,883
- Was the name Smith?
- Smith, yes.

611
00:49:18,053 --> 00:49:20,886
Smith.
The name seems familiar, somehow.

612
00:49:21,056 --> 00:49:24,048
I can't understand
why that girl is so late.

613
00:49:24,226 --> 00:49:26,421
I mean, she's usually so punctual.

614
00:49:26,595 --> 00:49:28,893
She takes that from me.
Her father isn't punctual.

615
00:49:29,064 --> 00:49:32,033
He catches trains and things,
but always at the last moment.

616
00:49:32,201 --> 00:49:33,896
I'm there at least an hour before.

617
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:37,095
Yes. I'm sure you are.
I have heard a lot about you, Mrs. Gill.

618
00:49:37,273 --> 00:49:40,436
Oh, have you? Is Eve very fond of me?

619
00:49:40,609 --> 00:49:45,444
Have you known her long, Mr. Smith?
I've got the name right now, haven't I?

620
00:49:45,614 --> 00:49:47,912
I've known her
for about a day and a half.

621
00:49:48,684 --> 00:49:51,050
That's not very long.

622
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,482
Where did you meet?

623
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:55,954
As a matter of fact,
we met in the saloon bar of a pub.

624
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:57,615
Well.

625
00:49:57,793 --> 00:49:59,761
How interesting.

626
00:50:00,029 --> 00:50:01,257
Thank you.

627
00:50:03,165 --> 00:50:05,326
- Am I intruding?
- This is Mr. Smith.

628
00:50:05,501 --> 00:50:08,493
Mr. Smith, this is Eve's father.
We see him now and again.

629
00:50:08,671 --> 00:50:11,606
- How do you do, sir?
- Very well, indeed. Thank you.

630
00:50:11,774 --> 00:50:13,742
- Do sit down.
- Thank you.

631
00:50:15,177 --> 00:50:17,509
- Where's Eve?
- She should be here by this time.

632
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,977
She asked Mr. Smith to tea.

633
00:50:19,148 --> 00:50:20,877
Oh, good, good.
Anyone else coming?

634
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,484
I mean, going to be a party?
I am fond of parties.

635
00:50:23,652 --> 00:50:26,212
No. There's no one else coming,
and you weren't invited.

636
00:50:26,388 --> 00:50:28,515
Wasn't I? Oh, an oversight.

637
00:50:28,691 --> 00:50:30,056
But I forgive you.

638
00:50:30,225 --> 00:50:32,955
Forgiveness, Mr. Smith.
The secret of a happy married life.

639
00:50:33,128 --> 00:50:36,689
That and good long stretches of the
absence that makes the heart grow fonder.

640
00:50:36,865 --> 00:50:40,460
There you are, my dear.
The last but four of the Mahicans.

641
00:50:44,373 --> 00:50:47,740
- Will you forgive me, Mr. Ordinary Smith?
- Yes. I've just been set an example.

642
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:50,208
Yes, but he says his name
is just plain Smith.

643
00:50:50,379 --> 00:50:52,244
He did? I'm terribly sorry to be late...

644
00:50:52,414 --> 00:50:55,679
...but the rehearsal went on and
the awful part is, I have to go back.

645
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:58,684
- It was decent of you to have come.
- What are you doing here?

646
00:50:58,854 --> 00:51:01,652
- I've been trying to reach you all day.
- I took the boat out.

647
00:51:01,824 --> 00:51:03,689
We had quite a little cruise.

648
00:51:03,859 --> 00:51:05,918
Jonnie and me.

649
00:51:06,862 --> 00:51:10,229
Poor old Jonnie.
I hope his rheumatism is better.

650
00:51:13,035 --> 00:51:16,596
Do play something, Mr. Smith.
Mr. Smith is a pianist, Mother.

651
00:51:16,772 --> 00:51:18,740
Well, I think that's a delightful career.

652
00:51:18,974 --> 00:51:22,842
- I often wish I'd kept up my practicing.
- It's not exactly my career, Mrs. Gill.

653
00:51:23,012 --> 00:51:24,980
But you must play for us.
Make him, Mother.

654
00:51:25,147 --> 00:51:26,910
But I haven't even started my tea yet.

655
00:51:27,082 --> 00:51:29,414
But of course he hasn't.
Eve, you are ridiculous.

656
00:51:29,718 --> 00:51:32,619
But I've got to leave in a minute.
Please play.

657
00:51:33,055 --> 00:51:36,252
You know, Jonnie's not
much of a sailor, Eve.

658
00:51:36,658 --> 00:51:38,387
He was abominably seasick.

659
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:42,656
In fact, as soon as we got ashore,
Jonnie ran away.

660
00:51:42,831 --> 00:51:45,322
- Who's Jonnie?
- I wish I knew.

661
00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:48,163
He's about 57 different varieties.

662
00:51:48,337 --> 00:51:52,171
Roughly speaking, he was a dog of some
sort that strayed in a couple of nights ago.

663
00:51:52,341 --> 00:51:55,868
- Do the police know about him?
- No, no. I'm not worried about him.

664
00:51:56,045 --> 00:51:58,605
I daresay he'll find his way
back to his old master.

665
00:51:58,781 --> 00:52:00,214
Or mistress.

666
00:52:00,382 --> 00:52:03,044
I thought we might have to ask
for your help, Mr. Smith.

667
00:52:03,218 --> 00:52:05,812
Mr. Smith is a detective, Mother.

668
00:52:05,988 --> 00:52:07,580
Mrs. Mason.

669
00:52:10,626 --> 00:52:13,026
A detective. How very unusual.

670
00:52:13,195 --> 00:52:15,288
I suppose you have
many fascinating cases.

671
00:52:15,464 --> 00:52:18,592
- Must be very exciting.
- Not very, I'm afraid.

672
00:52:18,767 --> 00:52:22,203
- Embezzlement, fraud, petty thefts.
- Smuggling?

673
00:52:22,371 --> 00:52:24,134
Yes. Occasionally. Brandy mostly.

674
00:52:24,573 --> 00:52:26,438
Murder, too, sometimes, Father.

675
00:52:26,608 --> 00:52:29,236
Mr. Smith is working on the Inwood case.

676
00:52:30,646 --> 00:52:35,049
Oh, you don't say so.
Yes, I read about that somewhere.

677
00:52:35,517 --> 00:52:37,382
How did you know?

678
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,654
I saw your photograph in the paper.

679
00:52:40,956 --> 00:52:43,424
What is the fellow's name, Clippen.

680
00:52:43,592 --> 00:52:45,560
Cooper, Cooper.
Did he do it, do you think?

681
00:52:45,727 --> 00:52:47,524
He has run away and remained in hiding.

682
00:52:47,696 --> 00:52:50,893
We're inclined to accept the obvious
as being obvious.

683
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:09,178
Oh, it's just like Sherlock Holmes
and his fiddle.

684
00:53:09,351 --> 00:53:14,584
A stream of beautiful sound,
and then suddenly out pops the solution.

685
00:53:26,168 --> 00:53:27,965
- Oh, I must run.
- So must I.

686
00:53:28,137 --> 00:53:31,231
- I don't know what you'll think of me.
- I like people bound up in their work.

687
00:53:31,406 --> 00:53:34,239
- You'll make a very good actress indeed.
<i>- Au revoir,</i> my pet.

688
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:37,308
Meet me at the stage door...

689
00:53:40,549 --> 00:53:44,178
- Can't I drive you back to the Academy?
- No. I want you to get to know Father.

690
00:53:44,353 --> 00:53:46,821
Not professionally,
but he's a wonderful character.

691
00:53:46,989 --> 00:53:49,890
- They'd be hurt if you didn't stay.
- When will I see you again?

692
00:53:50,058 --> 00:53:54,222
- Well, I really don't...
- Ring me tomorrow first thing. Regent 1113.

693
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:32,193
I know you think I'm an idiot,
but I'm not. I'm doing darn well.

694
00:54:32,367 --> 00:54:34,835
Yes. You're giving a very good show.
A very good show.

695
00:54:35,003 --> 00:54:38,336
- Pity you've no audience.
- But you're my audience.

696
00:54:38,507 --> 00:54:41,169
I wish you'd give me a little
applause now and then.

697
00:54:41,343 --> 00:54:44,335
- I wonder when Jonathan will turn up.
- Turn up where?

698
00:54:44,513 --> 00:54:46,743
Wherever Miss Charlotte Inwood
happens to be.

699
00:54:46,915 --> 00:54:48,815
Good heavens, she'll only turn him over.

700
00:54:48,984 --> 00:54:52,579
Yes, and to your nice new friend,
Mr. Smith.

701
00:55:07,302 --> 00:55:09,065
Who was that man?

702
00:55:09,238 --> 00:55:11,433
Oh, that was my dad, madam.

703
00:55:11,607 --> 00:55:14,337
I told him about my temporary job,
and he doesn't like it.

704
00:55:14,509 --> 00:55:16,739
What with the murder and all.
You know, madam.

705
00:55:16,912 --> 00:55:19,380
What's it got to do with him?
Or with you?

706
00:55:19,548 --> 00:55:22,881
My dad says that man on the run
might turn up here.

707
00:55:23,051 --> 00:55:25,212
Might even get into the dressing room.

708
00:55:25,387 --> 00:55:27,252
Might even murder me, madam.

709
00:55:27,422 --> 00:55:30,721
It's the scene of the crime the murderer
returns to, not the theater.

710
00:55:30,892 --> 00:55:32,621
He might be right, my dad.

711
00:55:32,794 --> 00:55:35,228
I'm surprised you're not
a bit afraid yourself.

712
00:55:35,731 --> 00:55:37,289
Slippers.

713
00:55:37,466 --> 00:55:39,957
This theater's the last place
he'd want to be seen in.

714
00:55:40,135 --> 00:55:42,467
Now, stop acting like a silly schoolgirl.

715
00:55:42,638 --> 00:55:46,096
The only murderer here
is the orchestra leader.

716
00:56:04,459 --> 00:56:07,826
Father, you've got to keep on the lookout
and head Jonathan off.

717
00:56:07,996 --> 00:56:10,021
Right. Certainly, my dear.

718
00:56:10,198 --> 00:56:12,598
This is desperate.

719
00:56:14,036 --> 00:56:17,005
Go on, go on, go on.

720
00:59:41,109 --> 00:59:42,337
Madam, madam.

721
00:59:42,511 --> 00:59:44,103
- What?
- Madam, there's a man.

722
00:59:45,113 --> 00:59:48,674
- He's gone up to your dressing room.
- What are you talking about? What man?

723
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:51,284
I saw him. Don't go up there.
It's dangerous.

724
00:59:51,453 --> 00:59:53,284
You're an imbecile.

725
00:59:53,455 --> 00:59:55,423
You needn't come up.

726
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:58,491
I'll manage to change myself.

727
01:00:20,448 --> 01:00:24,407
I know, Jonnie, darling,
but what a terrible risk you've taken.

728
01:00:24,586 --> 01:00:27,578
- I couldn't keep away.
- You haven't told me where you've been.

729
01:00:27,756 --> 01:00:30,054
Some friends looked after me.

730
01:00:30,225 --> 01:00:32,090
- What friends?
- Never mind that just now.

731
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:34,160
We've got to work out
a plan of campaign.

732
01:00:34,329 --> 01:00:37,298
- Everything is going on beautifully.
- We've got to get a story...

733
01:00:37,465 --> 01:00:40,992
...and we'll both have to stick to it.
- I must change.

734
01:00:42,704 --> 01:00:46,196
You shouldn't have come here, Jonnie.
You have been so wonderful up to now.

735
01:00:46,374 --> 01:00:49,036
Don't think that I'm ungrateful.
I'm not. Truly, I'm not.

736
01:00:49,678 --> 01:00:53,341
- I don't know how I shall ever repay you.
- Repay me?

737
01:00:54,316 --> 01:00:56,113
You talk as though this were a favor.

738
01:00:56,718 --> 01:00:59,380
Something that a "thank you"
can take care of.

739
01:00:59,554 --> 01:01:03,513
Dearest, you mustn't be foolish.
You must go away at once. Back to...

740
01:01:03,692 --> 01:01:05,353
...where you were hiding.

741
01:01:05,527 --> 01:01:08,052
Freddie's going to get you
out of the country soon.

742
01:01:08,229 --> 01:01:10,993
And I'll come to see you,
when the run of the show's over.

743
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:14,693
Why, that may be months,
maybe a year, or more.

744
01:01:14,869 --> 01:01:18,327
Well, you know how it is. We were
playing to capacity before this happened.

745
01:01:18,506 --> 01:01:20,474
Now they're hanging on to the chandeliers.

746
01:01:20,642 --> 01:01:22,234
Fifty pounds up tonight.

747
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:24,640
Goodness knows how they squeeze them in.

748
01:01:24,813 --> 01:01:28,772
Yes. I could only get standing room.

749
01:01:29,217 --> 01:01:31,481
Well, there you are.

750
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:35,347
We'll find a lovely place,
South America or somewhere.

751
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:40,193
And I'll come out to you, as soon
as all of this has blown over.

752
01:01:40,662 --> 01:01:44,291
I'll be glad of the rest for a week or two.

753
01:01:44,966 --> 01:01:46,661
Palm trees...

754
01:01:46,835 --> 01:01:48,462
...sunshine.

755
01:01:48,637 --> 01:01:49,934
Lovely.

756
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:52,470
A week or two?

757
01:01:52,641 --> 01:01:55,838
Well, you don't want me to give up
everything, do you?

758
01:01:56,878 --> 01:01:59,608
Why not? I have.

759
01:02:00,715 --> 01:02:04,913
Now, Jonnie, I thought you said that
my happiness was all that mattered...

760
01:02:05,086 --> 01:02:08,544
...and you must admit that
you behaved as if it was.

761
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:11,518
Taking all the trouble
to protect my reputation...

762
01:02:11,693 --> 01:02:13,285
...covering up the accident...

763
01:02:13,461 --> 01:02:16,658
...destroying that dreadful dress
with the bloodstain on it.

764
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,423
I didn't destroy it.

765
01:02:21,569 --> 01:02:22,900
You didn't?

766
01:02:25,206 --> 01:02:27,538
Jonnie, you promised.

767
01:02:27,709 --> 01:02:29,870
Don't you realize if they find the dress...

768
01:02:32,647 --> 01:02:36,879
So long as I have that dress, I'm the one
who decides how long this show will run.

769
01:02:37,218 --> 01:02:38,480
And everything else.

770
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,582
Do you understand?

771
01:02:41,723 --> 01:02:44,783
Where the devil is Miss Inwood?
The orchestra's started her number.

772
01:02:44,959 --> 01:02:47,393
My socks and suspenders, where is she?

773
01:02:47,562 --> 01:02:49,860
Take this. I'll change downstairs.

774
01:02:50,031 --> 01:02:52,090
Sorry, darling. A hook broke.

775
01:02:56,738 --> 01:02:59,571
Just a minute, Charlie.
Jonathan Cooper's in the theater.

776
01:02:59,741 --> 01:03:02,505
The sergeant's seen him.
He was sure to make for your room.

777
01:03:02,677 --> 01:03:06,306
- Have you seen him?
- Of course not. What a stupid idea.

778
01:03:06,481 --> 01:03:08,813
I think I better take a look
at your dressing room.

779
01:03:08,983 --> 01:03:12,009
Doris, show Sergeant Loomis where to go.

780
01:03:12,187 --> 01:03:15,122
- Freddie, there's something...
- Miss Inwood, please.

781
01:03:16,891 --> 01:03:20,054
Doris, what are you waiting for?

782
01:03:31,973 --> 01:03:34,373
Oh, Mr. Loomis, I feel so queer.
It's my heart.

783
01:03:34,542 --> 01:03:37,067
The doctor told me I should
take the stairs easy.

784
01:03:37,245 --> 01:03:39,770
You don't think he'll try to shoot
his way out, do you?

785
01:03:39,948 --> 01:03:42,508
He might be desperate, sergeant.

786
01:03:43,151 --> 01:03:46,314
Don't you think you ought
to go back and get a policeman?

787
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,221
She was glad he got away, Father.

788
01:04:27,395 --> 01:04:29,920
- How do you know?
- By a look she gave Freddie Williams.

789
01:04:31,132 --> 01:04:32,895
"Look she gave"? That won't get you far.

790
01:04:33,067 --> 01:04:35,968
She'd be more delighted if she knew
there was no stained dress.

791
01:04:36,137 --> 01:04:37,365
Oh, yes.

792
01:04:37,539 --> 01:04:40,599
- I wish we still had that dress.
- There's so very little time.

793
01:04:40,775 --> 01:04:43,403
We've got to make every minute count.

794
01:04:43,578 --> 01:04:45,170
I have to phone Smith tomorrow.

795
01:04:45,346 --> 01:04:48,179
Why don't I invite him to the theatrical
garden party with me?

796
01:04:48,349 --> 01:04:50,647
I have to sell programs there.

797
01:04:51,352 --> 01:04:54,651
- I don't quite follow you, my dear Holmes.
- In order to make him see.

798
01:04:54,823 --> 01:04:58,350
Nobody suspects our Charlotte yet,
and they've got to.

799
01:04:58,693 --> 01:05:01,821
First, you'd see my mother and father
and get approved by them.

800
01:05:01,996 --> 01:05:04,897
Most parents nowadays don't seem
to care what sort of people...

801
01:05:05,066 --> 01:05:08,558
...their children go around with,
but I'm not like that.

802
01:05:08,736 --> 01:05:12,263
I know I'm very old-fashioned,
but I've got to think of Eve.

803
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,772
What do you do for a living?

804
01:05:15,743 --> 01:05:17,233
I write a bit.

805
01:05:17,412 --> 01:05:19,380
What, novels and things?

806
01:05:19,547 --> 01:05:23,108
I'm very fond of novels. You know,
I read a delightful one the other day.

807
01:05:23,284 --> 01:05:26,082
Let me see. What was the title?
It was written by that woman.

808
01:05:26,254 --> 01:05:28,722
I can't remember, but she's written
a number of books.

809
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:32,326
You must have read some of them.
They're all about charming people.

810
01:05:32,493 --> 01:05:34,620
She only writes
about the nice side of life.

811
01:05:34,796 --> 01:05:36,696
Now, this book I was telling you about...

812
01:05:36,865 --> 01:05:39,390
...the title has just slipped
my memory for the moment.

813
01:05:39,567 --> 01:05:42,695
Well, it's about a mother, which is
a nice idea, I think, don't you?

814
01:05:42,871 --> 01:05:45,066
One reads so much
about the younger generation.

815
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,367
It does seem a brilliant idea
to have a change.

816
01:05:47,542 --> 01:05:48,907
Now, this mother isn't old...

817
01:05:49,544 --> 01:05:52,342
I'm sorry to turn up so late,
but I'm stranded for the night.

818
01:05:52,513 --> 01:05:56,074
All the hotels are full.
My flat's uninhabitable.

819
01:05:56,251 --> 01:05:59,652
I told you, it's in the hands
of the decorators.

820
01:05:59,821 --> 01:06:01,550
I know it's a frightful imposition...

821
01:06:01,723 --> 01:06:04,658
...but I wondered if you could
give me a shakedown somewhere?

822
01:06:04,826 --> 01:06:06,384
Well, of course we can.

823
01:06:06,561 --> 01:06:07,892
Can't we, Mother?

824
01:06:08,062 --> 01:06:11,054
Well, it's a little awkward.

825
01:06:11,499 --> 01:06:13,933
Is your father proposing
to stay here too?

826
01:06:14,102 --> 01:06:17,765
Well, Jonathan could have my room,
and I could sleep on the settee.

827
01:06:17,939 --> 01:06:19,998
Where shall we put your father?

828
01:06:22,577 --> 01:06:26,343
No. I'll sleep on the settee,
and you can sleep with your mama.

829
01:06:26,514 --> 01:06:30,848
- I hate to put you to all this trouble.
- Not at all, Mr...? What is your name?

830
01:06:31,819 --> 01:06:33,343
- Jones.
- Brown.

831
01:06:33,521 --> 01:06:36,456
Robinson. Now, Mr. Robinson,
I think we'll make it bye-byes.

832
01:06:36,624 --> 01:06:39,650
A blanket for the commodore,
and we'll all go to bye-byes.

833
01:06:39,827 --> 01:06:42,853
Robinson. I've heard that name before.

834
01:06:46,634 --> 01:06:50,730
No, it won't do. Has Eve gone mad,
turning the house into a hotel in the night?

835
01:06:50,905 --> 01:06:53,806
Who is this man, anyway?
What is his name?

836
01:06:53,975 --> 01:06:55,943
Well, perhaps you better not mention it.

837
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:58,670
The fact is that he's
a fugitive from justice.

838
01:06:58,846 --> 01:07:01,178
The whole police force is on his heels,
and Eve...

839
01:07:01,349 --> 01:07:04,546
Well, for reasons of her own, my dear,
doesn't want him to be caught.

840
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:06,209
He's...

841
01:07:06,654 --> 01:07:08,815
He's wanted for murder.

842
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:11,424
Now you're going too far.

843
01:07:12,894 --> 01:07:16,352
I suppose you think I believed that
that Mr. Smith, who came here to tea...

844
01:07:16,531 --> 01:07:18,294
...was a real detective.

845
01:07:25,239 --> 01:07:29,005
If I hadn't heard her maid's voice outside
the dressing room, they'd have got me.

846
01:07:29,177 --> 01:07:32,010
Eve, darling, I know I should
never have trusted her.

847
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:36,014
Darling, you've been wonderful to me.
I don't deserve it, but I need you.

848
01:07:36,551 --> 01:07:38,382
I need you more than ever.

849
01:07:38,553 --> 01:07:40,714
Tonight, when I found
what Charlotte was...

850
01:07:40,888 --> 01:07:43,288
...all of a sudden,
I thought my brain would burst.

851
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:45,255
After all that I'd done for her.

852
01:07:45,426 --> 01:07:48,827
Everything I did for her was because
I loved her and she loved me.

853
01:08:07,215 --> 01:08:09,649
- I'm so sorry.
- Why the umbrella?

854
01:08:09,817 --> 01:08:12,285
It is a garden party, isn't it?

855
01:08:12,453 --> 01:08:15,081
Oh, Roehampton Club, please.

856
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:22,728
It couldn't be helped, I'm afraid.
You must blame a Miss Doris Tinsdale.

857
01:08:22,897 --> 01:08:25,491
Who is Doris Tinsdale?

858
01:08:25,666 --> 01:08:30,228
She's Charlotte Inwood's temporary dresser.
We've been searching for her all afternoon.

859
01:08:30,405 --> 01:08:32,066
One of our men at the theater...

860
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:35,641
...let her slip through his fingers
without making a statement.

861
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:37,744
You look very lovely.

862
01:08:38,813 --> 01:08:41,373
You're very sweet to say so.

863
01:08:42,383 --> 01:08:45,682
What has this Doris Tinsdale person
got to do with the case?

864
01:08:45,853 --> 01:08:47,445
Or shouldn't I ask, Mr. Smith?

865
01:08:47,622 --> 01:08:51,149
Well, Cooper was at the theater last night,
and we think she saw him.

866
01:08:51,325 --> 01:08:54,988
And don't call me Mr. Smith.
After all, my name is...

867
01:08:55,163 --> 01:08:56,687
Wilfred.

868
01:08:57,465 --> 01:08:59,126
Not very good, is it?

869
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:01,928
It suits some people very nicely.

870
01:09:02,403 --> 01:09:05,702
I rather liked it when you called me
"Ordinary Smith."

871
01:09:05,873 --> 01:09:09,365
- Oh, I didn't mean to, really.
- But I liked it. I liked it very much.

872
01:09:09,544 --> 01:09:11,910
Please go on calling me that, will you?

873
01:09:12,647 --> 01:09:14,979
Yes, I will.

874
01:09:16,617 --> 01:09:18,608
What were we talking about?

875
01:09:19,187 --> 01:09:24,420
Oh, yes. I was going to ask you,
why did Cooper risk going to the theater?

876
01:09:24,592 --> 01:09:28,050
He must have had a very strong reason
for wanting to talk to Miss Inwood.

877
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:32,461
- Let's not talk shop on a day like this.
- Oh, I am sorry.

878
01:09:32,633 --> 01:09:34,498
Do you hate inquisitive people?

879
01:09:35,269 --> 01:09:37,169
Of course not. I'm one myself.

880
01:09:37,338 --> 01:09:43,402
But seriously, Ordinary, do you think there's
anything between Cooper and Miss Inwood?

881
01:09:44,245 --> 01:09:49,649
Seriously, "Extraordinary,"
I shouldn't be a bit surprised.

882
01:09:53,588 --> 01:09:56,489
What a curious person she must be.

883
01:09:57,058 --> 01:10:02,086
I mean, going back on the stage
so soon after everything.

884
01:10:02,663 --> 01:10:03,960
The show must go on.

885
01:10:04,132 --> 01:10:08,330
A smiling face, a breaking heart.
Actors rather like it, I'm told.

886
01:10:10,004 --> 01:10:11,631
But today...

887
01:10:11,806 --> 01:10:14,798
...going right from the funeral
to the garden party.

888
01:10:15,376 --> 01:10:18,209
I must say, I think that's
overdoing things a bit.

889
01:10:18,379 --> 01:10:21,610
A strong sense of the dramatics
and all that sort of thing.

890
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:24,311
It's...

891
01:10:25,086 --> 01:10:27,850
...so cold and calculating of her.

892
01:10:29,524 --> 01:10:31,014
Is it?

893
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:34,725
Yes, it is.

894
01:10:36,564 --> 01:10:41,024
If she's that cold and calculating,
I was wondering...

895
01:10:41,202 --> 01:10:44,729
...maybe she had something to do
with her husband's death.

896
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,398
Were you?

897
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:50,400
After all...

898
01:10:50,578 --> 01:10:53,308
...there must be a lot
that doesn't appear on the surface.

899
01:10:53,814 --> 01:10:56,783
I mean, like...

900
01:10:56,951 --> 01:10:59,385
...wheels within wheels.

901
01:11:00,254 --> 01:11:03,917
Who...? Who knows what goes on
in a woman's mind?

902
01:11:05,459 --> 01:11:06,949
I don't know.

903
01:11:07,895 --> 01:11:10,557
And if I don't know, I...

904
01:11:10,731 --> 01:11:12,221
Well...

905
01:11:12,733 --> 01:11:14,496
...who?

906
01:11:14,669 --> 01:11:17,968
A woman's mind sometimes...

907
01:11:19,407 --> 01:11:22,740
I was saying that a woman's mind...

908
01:11:23,978 --> 01:11:25,673
That's right.

909
01:11:26,981 --> 01:11:28,471
Do you really?

910
01:11:30,084 --> 01:11:31,676
I think so too.

911
01:11:32,653 --> 01:11:35,053
In Miss Inwood's case?

912
01:11:35,223 --> 01:11:36,554
What?

913
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:38,686
What?

914
01:12:08,823 --> 01:12:12,156
I have to report to the committee tent
to get my programs.

915
01:12:12,627 --> 01:12:16,688
<i>- Whether to give it to the orphans</i>
<i>or to let the government take it.</i>

916
01:12:16,864 --> 01:12:18,957
<i>I'm putting it to you!</i>

917
01:12:19,133 --> 01:12:20,896
There's the committee tent over there.

918
01:12:21,068 --> 01:12:24,401
You do understand I won't be able to spend
the whole afternoon with you?

919
01:12:24,572 --> 01:12:28,064
Can't I go with you? I can sell a mean
program. We bloodhounds have methods.

920
01:12:28,242 --> 01:12:31,040
But you must go and amuse yourself.
I can't take you with me.

921
01:12:31,212 --> 01:12:34,670
Every time I begin to think I know
what color your eyes are, you disappear.

922
01:12:34,849 --> 01:12:38,876
But it's against the rules. Now please go.
I'll pick you up later. I'll get in trouble.

923
01:12:39,053 --> 01:12:43,581
<i>Right here. Step right up.</i>
<i>Yes, madam. Over here...</i>

924
01:12:43,758 --> 01:12:47,421
Eve, you brute. Wherever have you been?
You're hours late.

925
01:12:47,595 --> 01:12:50,257
- I'm sorry, Chubby.
- What a day. What a day.

926
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,921
- Hello, Valerie.
- Hello, Eve.

927
01:12:52,099 --> 01:12:55,091
Oh, this is Wilfred Smith.
Chubby Bannister and Valerie Maynard.

928
01:12:55,269 --> 01:12:56,736
They're at RADA with me.

929
01:12:56,904 --> 01:12:59,771
- Well, how do you do, Mr. Smith?
- How do you do?

930
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:02,568
I'm sure you'd love some ice cream.
Chubby could show you where it is.

931
01:13:02,743 --> 01:13:05,007
- Oh, but I'd adore to.
- That's most good of you.

932
01:13:05,179 --> 01:13:08,876
I hope you'll remember me by this little
token of my regard and esteem.

933
01:13:09,884 --> 01:13:11,112
Allow me.

934
01:13:11,285 --> 01:13:15,619
<i>As you know, this fete is being held</i>
<i>for the aid of the Actors' Orphanage.</i>

935
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:19,419
<i>Now, it's raining outside, and if you've</i>
<i>got half a pound to spare, come in...</i>

936
01:13:19,593 --> 01:13:20,890
Which programs shall I take?

937
01:13:21,062 --> 01:13:23,326
- Take that pile, dear.
- Thank you.

938
01:13:33,341 --> 01:13:37,209
You newspaperwomen work hard
at your job, don't you, Miss Gill?

939
01:13:37,378 --> 01:13:38,709
How did you know my name?

940
01:13:38,879 --> 01:13:41,006
Called that number you gave me
for emergency.

941
01:13:41,182 --> 01:13:44,879
A Mrs. Gill answered,
and I put two and two together.

942
01:13:45,052 --> 01:13:48,419
- What did you need me for in such a hurry?
- Don't talk to me like that.

943
01:13:48,589 --> 01:13:51,490
I've come down here to tell you
Miss Inwood's looking for you.

944
01:13:51,659 --> 01:13:54,719
- What does she want?
- She wants your head, of course.

945
01:13:54,895 --> 01:13:58,387
What's more, she said the police want
to talk to a Miss Doris Tinsdale.

946
01:13:58,566 --> 01:14:00,966
She wants to know when I'm going
back to my work.

947
01:14:01,135 --> 01:14:03,296
I told her my stomach
was still out of order.

948
01:14:03,471 --> 01:14:04,938
Well, it's better now.

949
01:14:05,106 --> 01:14:08,269
- Much better, thank you.
- You want more money, don't you?

950
01:14:08,442 --> 01:14:12,879
Well, look at the risk I'm running. I'd better
go to Miss Inwood and tell her everything.

951
01:14:13,047 --> 01:14:16,915
And before that detective finds out
there's no such person as Doris.

952
01:14:18,052 --> 01:14:20,350
Here's 5 pounds. It's all I have with me.

953
01:14:21,522 --> 01:14:24,582
Oh, my job's worth more than that,
at least another 20.

954
01:14:24,759 --> 01:14:28,251
I'll meet you outside Miss Inwood's tent
in half an hour.

955
01:14:33,267 --> 01:14:35,531
Finished already? You are doing well.

956
01:14:35,703 --> 01:14:39,002
- May I use your phone?
- Why, yes, of course, my dear. There it is.

957
01:14:39,173 --> 01:14:40,765
Thank you.

958
01:14:48,115 --> 01:14:49,548
Hello. Is that you, Father?

959
01:14:49,717 --> 01:14:53,380
Could you come right away? With all
the money you can lay your hands on.

960
01:14:53,554 --> 01:14:55,818
At least 20 pounds. At least!

961
01:14:56,323 --> 01:14:57,756
It's Nellie.

962
01:14:57,925 --> 01:15:00,359
The girl I'm understudying.

963
01:15:00,528 --> 01:15:02,621
Yes. Be quick, darling.

964
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:04,319
<i>No queuing.</i>

965
01:15:04,598 --> 01:15:06,793
<i>No queuing here.</i>
<i>Step right up.</i>

966
01:15:06,967 --> 01:15:10,368
<i>Yes, madam, over here...</i>

967
01:15:10,871 --> 01:15:12,736
Doris, isn't it?

968
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:17,739
Yes, sir.

969
01:15:19,079 --> 01:15:22,708
Yes, sir. I took your advice, sir.
I done myself up.

970
01:15:22,883 --> 01:15:25,147
I mean, what do you think of it?

971
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:27,787
- Where have you been?
- Oh, I can explain it, sir.

972
01:15:27,955 --> 01:15:30,719
- Only yesterday...
- Come along. I'll take you to Miss Inwood.

973
01:15:30,891 --> 01:15:32,756
Come on, hurry.

974
01:15:33,794 --> 01:15:39,323
<i>Roll up, roll up, roll up. Come and have</i>
<i>a good time. Come on, sir. You, sir...</i>

975
01:15:42,036 --> 01:15:43,628
Miss Tinsdale to see you.

976
01:15:43,804 --> 01:15:47,069
Well, this is a pleasure. Where have
you been? I thought you were dead.

977
01:15:47,241 --> 01:15:51,041
Oh, no, madam. I wasn't.
As a matter of fact...

978
01:15:51,212 --> 01:15:55,410
You needn't go into detail. I hope you're not
turning into one of those explicit people...

979
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:58,484
...who always tell you exactly
how they feel when you ask them.

980
01:15:58,652 --> 01:16:00,779
You did leave me a trifle suspended,
however.

981
01:16:00,955 --> 01:16:02,718
I'm sorry, madam.

982
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:04,482
I was held up.

983
01:16:05,626 --> 01:16:07,321
Darling!

984
01:16:07,495 --> 01:16:10,396
Whatever happened to that
peculiar figure of yours?

985
01:16:11,198 --> 01:16:12,756
It's a new dress, madam.

986
01:16:12,933 --> 01:16:14,594
Keep it, dear.

987
01:16:14,768 --> 01:16:16,895
What it does for you is worth thousands.

988
01:16:17,071 --> 01:16:18,538
I bought it at a sale.

989
01:16:18,706 --> 01:16:21,675
Don't confide in me.
Just pour some tea, would you?

990
01:16:25,312 --> 01:16:27,405
By the way, Doris...

991
01:16:27,581 --> 01:16:30,744
...did Nellie tell you the police
want to talk to you?

992
01:16:30,918 --> 01:16:33,250
But whatever for, madam?

993
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:35,479
Oh, I hope they won't upset my dad.

994
01:16:35,656 --> 01:16:38,454
- My dad said...
- They're not going to eat you, darling.

995
01:16:38,626 --> 01:16:42,619
It's not important. Just pull yourself
together and pour the tea.

996
01:16:47,234 --> 01:16:50,203
Rehearsals from morning till night.
If we wanted to misbehave...

997
01:16:50,371 --> 01:16:52,771
...we couldn't find a minute to do it in.
- No.

998
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:56,398
Yes, so I understand. Eve tells me she kept
hard at it all day and evening.

999
01:16:56,577 --> 01:17:00,411
But Eve hasn't been near for days. I thought
she was home with a cold or something.

1000
01:17:00,581 --> 01:17:03,573
- Maybe she's got a job in a show.
- Gosh.

1001
01:17:03,751 --> 01:17:07,585
<i>A fortune in five minutes,</i>
<i>and there's no income tax on it tonight.</i>

1002
01:17:22,136 --> 01:17:24,696
Excuse me, madam. I've...

1003
01:17:24,872 --> 01:17:26,931
I've got to sneeze.

1004
01:17:50,998 --> 01:17:53,296
- Miss Livingston, I presume.
- That's not my name.

1005
01:17:53,467 --> 01:17:57,198
Oh, no, no. It's Nellie Goode, isn't it?
But what does the name matter?

1006
01:17:57,371 --> 01:18:00,704
After all, I could think of lots of much
more appropriate names for you.

1007
01:18:00,874 --> 01:18:03,365
Yes, I could think of a few for you too.
Who are you?

1008
01:18:04,945 --> 01:18:08,346
I understand my daughter has entered
into a somewhat shady transaction.

1009
01:18:08,515 --> 01:18:12,281
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Well, you are a blackmailer, aren't you?

1010
01:18:12,453 --> 01:18:15,081
You know, that's a very,
very naughty thing to be.

1011
01:18:15,255 --> 01:18:18,918
Don't say things like that to me.
You could be had up for a thing like that.

1012
01:18:19,093 --> 01:18:20,492
Now, don't be so peppery.

1013
01:18:20,661 --> 01:18:23,960
- I like to keep things on a friendly basis.
- One short.

1014
01:18:24,131 --> 01:18:26,463
It's all I've got. You don't want
me to walk home...

1015
01:18:26,634 --> 01:18:28,659
I don't care if you crawl home.

1016
01:18:28,836 --> 01:18:33,432
Oh, well, it doesn't matter. I'm not mean.
And you've got till tomorrow morning.

1017
01:18:34,208 --> 01:18:37,268
Father, Freddie Williams, Charlotte's
manager, spotted me as Doris.

1018
01:18:37,444 --> 01:18:39,844
I had to go into Charlotte's tent.

1019
01:18:40,014 --> 01:18:42,539
If there's one thing I hate,
it's saying I told you so.

1020
01:18:42,716 --> 01:18:46,049
And the police want to talk to Doris.
I don't know which way to turn.

1021
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:48,745
I think I'll get Smith
and tell him the whole story.

1022
01:18:48,922 --> 01:18:51,117
Have you got him to suspect
Charlotte yet?

1023
01:18:51,692 --> 01:18:53,057
I'm afraid not.

1024
01:18:54,028 --> 01:18:57,987
But I thought you had to pick him up at
Whitehall. Didn't you talk to him about it?

1025
01:18:58,732 --> 01:19:00,791
But, yes, I did...

1026
01:19:01,402 --> 01:19:03,233
...in a way.

1027
01:19:04,538 --> 01:19:06,130
In a way?

1028
01:19:06,306 --> 01:19:08,433
Oh, I see.

1029
01:19:08,609 --> 01:19:12,375
Some more important topic arose
in the conversation.

1030
01:19:12,546 --> 01:19:15,811
Only there's one slight complication,
my dear: Jonathan.

1031
01:19:15,983 --> 01:19:19,384
You're not, by any chance, thinking
of changing horses in midstream?

1032
01:19:19,553 --> 01:19:21,680
Father, is it awful of me?

1033
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:24,517
Not awful, my dear,
just rather a bad bit of timing.

1034
01:19:24,692 --> 01:19:26,785
No matter how my feelings
toward him change...

1035
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,224
...I still can't let Jonathan down, can I?

1036
01:19:29,396 --> 01:19:31,921
Not while he's hiding in our house.

1037
01:19:44,311 --> 01:19:48,304
Call yourself an actress? There's your
big scene, if you have the pluck to take it.

1038
01:19:48,482 --> 01:19:52,316
You have the law on your arm. All you have
to do is rush in there and shout, "Stop!

1039
01:19:52,486 --> 01:19:54,283
That woman is a murderess!"

1040
01:19:54,455 --> 01:19:58,118
And then she'll say, "How dare you?"
And you'll say, "I'll dare and dare again.

1041
01:19:58,292 --> 01:20:02,160
What about the bloodstained dress,
eh, Miss Charlotte Inwood?"

1042
01:20:02,329 --> 01:20:06,095
- And then she'll say...
- Please. This is serious, Father.

1043
01:20:06,266 --> 01:20:09,394
- Oh, Eve! There you are.
- I couldn't find you anywhere.

1044
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:14,200
- I've been trying to get rid of my programs.
- I've been too busy talking to sell mine.

1045
01:20:14,374 --> 01:20:15,898
Do you think I talk too much?

1046
01:20:16,076 --> 01:20:17,839
No. Most women don't talk enough.

1047
01:20:18,011 --> 01:20:21,811
- I hate shy women.
- No one could ever call me shy...

1048
01:20:44,905 --> 01:20:47,271
Who'll come over to shoot
some lovely ducks?

1049
01:20:47,441 --> 01:20:50,842
It will only cost you half a crown,
and it does such good for the orphans.

1050
01:20:51,011 --> 01:20:54,344
Who'll come and shoot lovely ducks
here for half a crown?

1051
01:20:54,515 --> 01:20:57,643
Only half a crown to shoot lovely ducks!

1052
01:21:02,523 --> 01:21:04,047
Eve.

1053
01:21:05,826 --> 01:21:07,794
Excuse me.

1054
01:21:08,495 --> 01:21:11,191
Look, Eve, hold everything.
I have an idea.

1055
01:21:11,365 --> 01:21:15,859
Get Smith into Charlotte's tent,
as near the front as you can.

1056
01:21:16,036 --> 01:21:18,231
Go on, quickly.

1057
01:21:20,407 --> 01:21:22,967
- What do you say we hear Charlotte sing?
- Oh, do let's.

1058
01:21:23,143 --> 01:21:26,112
The murder makes her so interesting.

1059
01:21:27,314 --> 01:21:30,613
- You know, I think I'll wait outside.
- But you promised.

1060
01:21:31,251 --> 01:21:33,879
- I promised?
- In the taxi.

1061
01:21:34,054 --> 01:21:37,251
You said the first thing we'd do would be
to go hear Charlotte Inwood.

1062
01:21:37,424 --> 01:21:39,016
Don't you remember?

1063
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:42,194
Do you know? I can't remember.

1064
01:21:42,362 --> 01:21:44,592
I must have had some sort of a blackout.

1065
01:21:45,999 --> 01:21:49,230
- Oh, do let's hurry. We'll miss her.
- I think she's just dreamy.

1066
01:21:49,403 --> 01:21:52,395
Only half a crown to shoot a lovely duck!

1067
01:21:52,573 --> 01:21:54,803
You can win a lovely prize!
Heavenly prizes!

1068
01:21:54,975 --> 01:21:57,500
Only half a crown to shoot...
Would you like to shoot?

1069
01:21:57,678 --> 01:22:00,875
No, no. I hate firearms. I wonder
if I could buy one of those dolls.

1070
01:22:01,048 --> 01:22:02,276
- A doll?
- Yes, please.

1071
01:22:02,449 --> 01:22:04,212
- Which doll?
- Oh, any doll. That doll.

1072
01:22:04,384 --> 01:22:07,820
- I suppose, but you'll have to pay for it.
- I know, but how much, please?

1073
01:22:07,988 --> 01:22:10,786
- Well, it's for the orphans.
- Yes, I know, but how much?

1074
01:22:10,958 --> 01:22:14,587
- You are sorry for the orphans, aren't you?
- Of course I am, but how much?

1075
01:22:14,761 --> 01:22:17,753
We all are, aren't we? Well, I suppose...

1076
01:22:17,931 --> 01:22:19,956
...at least four pounds.

1077
01:22:22,102 --> 01:22:24,662
- Give me the gun.
- Well, half a crown, then.

1078
01:22:24,838 --> 01:22:28,103
- Yes.
- You know. Money first.

1079
01:22:30,177 --> 01:22:32,270
- Now, shall I put it in for you?
- Yes, please.

1080
01:22:32,446 --> 01:22:34,471
It breaks somewhere here. I can't...

1081
01:22:34,648 --> 01:22:37,640
It's rather...

1082
01:22:37,818 --> 01:22:39,718
Perhaps I can manage.

1083
01:22:39,887 --> 01:22:43,516
Wait a minute. I think you'll have to do
it yourself. I'm not frightfully good.

1084
01:22:43,690 --> 01:22:46,318
Be rather careful, won't you?
You know, it goes off.

1085
01:22:51,732 --> 01:22:53,632
Got you again, my beauty.

1086
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,859
My bird, I think, sir.

1087
01:22:56,036 --> 01:22:57,435
Could I have the doll, please?

1088
01:22:57,604 --> 01:22:59,572
What did you say?

1089
01:23:02,009 --> 01:23:03,271
Good shot, sir.

1090
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:06,108
Well done. I'll get you your doll.

1091
01:23:08,849 --> 01:23:11,784
Here you are, sir. Now, then,
who's going to shoot lovely ducks?

1092
01:23:11,952 --> 01:23:13,886
Would you like to shoot lovely ducks?

1093
01:23:14,054 --> 01:23:16,522
- Yes. Half a crown's worth.
- You sure that's enough?

1094
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:20,786
Oh, yes, certainly. Yes, I don't need
any more. I very seldom miss.

1095
01:23:29,469 --> 01:23:31,835
Oh, got it at last. Could I have
the doll, please?

1096
01:23:32,005 --> 01:23:34,974
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm afraid that's mine.

1097
01:23:35,142 --> 01:23:36,837
What did you say?

1098
01:23:37,010 --> 01:23:39,137
Nothing at all.

1099
01:23:39,913 --> 01:23:43,542
- Could I have the doll, please?
- Well done. I'll go and get it for you.

1100
01:23:43,717 --> 01:23:46,311
It is rather nice, I think,
to have won it, don't you?

1101
01:23:46,486 --> 01:23:50,422
You did earn it that time. They're lovely
dolls. They're fully dressed. Fully.

1102
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:52,057
Thank you very much.

1103
01:23:52,225 --> 01:23:56,059
Now, who's going to come and shoot lovely
duck over here for only half a crown?

1104
01:23:56,229 --> 01:24:00,097
We're having such fun over here shooting
duck for only half a crown!

1105
01:25:30,257 --> 01:25:31,485
Eve.

1106
01:25:31,825 --> 01:25:33,053
Eve.

1107
01:26:26,513 --> 01:26:27,741
I'm sorry.

1108
01:26:28,248 --> 01:26:29,909
Ladies and gentlemen.

1109
01:26:35,188 --> 01:26:37,179
Doris. Doris!

1110
01:26:37,357 --> 01:26:39,154
Miss Tinsdale!

1111
01:26:40,527 --> 01:26:41,824
Come and give a hand here.

1112
01:26:44,164 --> 01:26:45,756
What are you waiting for?

1113
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:01,643
I'm sorry, sir.

1114
01:27:15,362 --> 01:27:18,695
<i>Do you think there's anything between</i>
<i>Cooper and Miss Inwood?</i>

1115
01:27:18,865 --> 01:27:20,958
<i>But Eve hasn't been near for days.</i>

1116
01:27:21,134 --> 01:27:22,999
<i>Doris! Miss Tinsdale!</i>

1117
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:25,961
We got away as quickly as possible,
and here we are.

1118
01:27:26,139 --> 01:27:30,098
And that's the story of the short
and stormy life of Doris Tinsdale.

1119
01:27:30,277 --> 01:27:32,643
It is in many respects a sad one,
but, one hopes...

1120
01:27:32,812 --> 01:27:35,246
...not entirely without usefulness.

1121
01:27:35,415 --> 01:27:38,441
The next thing is to wait
for the arrival of Mr. Ordinary Smith...

1122
01:27:38,618 --> 01:27:41,280
...with his posse to arrest
the whole boiling lot of us.

1123
01:27:41,454 --> 01:27:44,582
Well, you think I should give myself up,
is that it?

1124
01:27:45,025 --> 01:27:48,791
Yes, I should, shouldn't I? The longer
I stay here, the worse it will be for you.

1125
01:27:48,962 --> 01:27:52,523
But I won't give up. There must be
a way to get at Charlotte.

1126
01:27:52,699 --> 01:27:56,465
Now, I've made a nice hot toddy
for you, Mr. Robinson.

1127
01:27:56,636 --> 01:27:59,070
There's nothing like it for a cold,
is there?

1128
01:27:59,239 --> 01:28:00,638
Thank you.

1129
01:28:01,007 --> 01:28:05,205
Isn't it dreadful? Mr. Robinson hasn't been
able to stir out of his room since he arrived.

1130
01:28:05,378 --> 01:28:07,346
These spring colds are really frightful.

1131
01:28:07,514 --> 01:28:11,211
Oh, by the way, Eve, Mr. Smith
is downstairs and wants to see you.

1132
01:28:11,384 --> 01:28:13,181
I think it would be such a good idea...

1133
01:28:13,353 --> 01:28:16,845
...if I made Mr. Robinson a nice,
hot mustard plaster.

1134
01:28:17,023 --> 01:28:19,014
I wonder if he's got a temperature.

1135
01:28:19,192 --> 01:28:22,787
I've broken my thermometer, but you could
easily run to the chemist's...

1136
01:28:40,513 --> 01:28:43,141
How long have you been
Miss Inwood's maid?

1137
01:28:44,117 --> 01:28:47,780
As I think you know, we've been anxious
to ask Doris Tinsdale a few questions.

1138
01:28:47,954 --> 01:28:51,446
- I can explain...
- Did you talk to Jonathan Cooper last night?

1139
01:28:51,891 --> 01:28:53,791
- No.
- Did you see him?

1140
01:28:54,661 --> 01:28:55,992
- Yes.
- Where?

1141
01:28:57,364 --> 01:28:59,389
On his way to Miss Inwood's dressing room.

1142
01:28:59,566 --> 01:29:02,160
He was there when she went up to change.

1143
01:29:02,335 --> 01:29:05,270
I listened at the door and overheard
him say something about...

1144
01:29:05,438 --> 01:29:08,032
...a bloodstained dress belonging to her.

1145
01:29:08,208 --> 01:29:10,676
And then suddenly, she became afraid.

1146
01:29:10,844 --> 01:29:12,903
Do you hear? Afraid.

1147
01:29:13,446 --> 01:29:15,607
When you took Sergeant Loomis
up to the room...

1148
01:29:15,782 --> 01:29:17,909
...you presumed Cooper to be still there?

1149
01:29:18,285 --> 01:29:19,980
Well, I didn't know.

1150
01:29:20,153 --> 01:29:22,553
No, you didn't know,
but you had a pretty fair idea.

1151
01:29:22,722 --> 01:29:24,485
Why didn't you tell Loomis?

1152
01:29:25,325 --> 01:29:30,194
Then you did a very neat fainting fit, which
probably allowed Cooper to get clear away.

1153
01:29:32,132 --> 01:29:34,362
Don't talk like that.

1154
01:29:34,534 --> 01:29:36,764
I can't bear it.

1155
01:29:41,675 --> 01:29:43,700
I don't understand it.

1156
01:29:45,612 --> 01:29:49,048
- How could you behave like that?
- But I can explain.

1157
01:29:49,949 --> 01:29:51,576
I don't think that's necessary.

1158
01:29:51,751 --> 01:29:55,812
In my job, I find a woman goes to almost
any length to protect her lover.

1159
01:29:56,022 --> 01:29:57,614
But it's not like that.

1160
01:29:57,791 --> 01:29:59,691
It's not like that at all.

1161
01:29:59,859 --> 01:30:02,259
I thought I was in love with Jonathan...

1162
01:30:02,429 --> 01:30:04,226
...but I'm not anymore.

1163
01:30:05,365 --> 01:30:08,960
But it doesn't mean I won't go on
helping him, as I would any innocent man.

1164
01:30:09,135 --> 01:30:13,071
It's not for you to decide whether he's
innocent or not. You leave that to the law.

1165
01:30:13,239 --> 01:30:15,469
The point is, you put yourself
and your father...

1166
01:30:15,642 --> 01:30:18,941
...in a very serious position
by this infernal amateur meddling.

1167
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,840
How I'm going to get you out of it,
I don't know.

1168
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:25,979
But you do want to get us out?

1169
01:30:27,587 --> 01:30:30,454
In spite of the fact you made such
a fool of me, you mean.

1170
01:30:31,791 --> 01:30:34,316
Your acting in the taxi
was extremely clever.

1171
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:41,564
I wasn't acting in the taxi.

1172
01:30:43,069 --> 01:30:47,028
I fell in love with someone,
and all my plans went out the window.

1173
01:30:48,408 --> 01:30:53,311
When we were in the taxi together, I felt
as though I were on a great golden cloud.

1174
01:30:54,214 --> 01:30:58,742
I told Father I didn't want to go on
with this. I wanted to tell you everything.

1175
01:30:58,918 --> 01:31:03,014
But he had an idea about
a bloodstained doll, and I had to put it off.

1176
01:31:04,124 --> 01:31:06,354
I wanted to tell you all about it.

1177
01:31:07,093 --> 01:31:08,958
Please believe me.

1178
01:31:12,065 --> 01:31:14,966
Would you like to mix a cocktail
yourself, Mr. Smith?

1179
01:31:15,135 --> 01:31:19,094
I'm afraid there's no ice,
but I'm sure you can manage.

1180
01:31:21,141 --> 01:31:23,302
- Good evening, Smith.
- Good evening.

1181
01:31:23,676 --> 01:31:26,645
- Do I hear the muted clanking of chains?
- It's only the plumbing.

1182
01:31:26,813 --> 01:31:28,474
It's in a dreadful state.

1183
01:31:28,648 --> 01:31:30,741
How did you enjoy the garden party,
Mr. Smith?

1184
01:31:30,917 --> 01:31:33,112
It must have been awful in that rain.

1185
01:31:33,286 --> 01:31:36,778
I think I'll take some sherry
up to Mr. Robinson.

1186
01:31:36,956 --> 01:31:40,687
I've quite changed my mind about him.
He seems such a nice young man after all.

1187
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:44,193
Eve, dear, you will look after
Mr. Smith, won't you?

1188
01:31:46,433 --> 01:31:50,062
Father, I've been explaining to Mr. Smith
what we're trying to do.

1189
01:31:50,236 --> 01:31:52,295
He thinks we ought to stop.

1190
01:31:52,472 --> 01:31:54,269
Oh, what a pity.

1191
01:31:54,441 --> 01:31:58,002
Just when you and I were about to save
Mr. Smith so much trouble.

1192
01:31:58,812 --> 01:32:00,939
Save me trouble?

1193
01:32:01,114 --> 01:32:04,481
Sir, you don't look like an irresponsible
imbecile. Why behave like one?

1194
01:32:04,651 --> 01:32:09,088
You let your daughter get mixed up in this?
What sort of father do you think you are?

1195
01:32:09,255 --> 01:32:11,689
Unique. Quite unique.

1196
01:32:11,858 --> 01:32:15,624
But rather broken-hearted at this moment.
You see, I have another idea.

1197
01:32:15,795 --> 01:32:18,320
A pity to waste ideas, isn't it?

1198
01:32:19,332 --> 01:32:23,166
Have you...? Have you ever
been blackmailed, Mr. Smith?

1199
01:32:23,336 --> 01:32:25,736
Well, I have. Only this afternoon.

1200
01:32:25,905 --> 01:32:28,430
At least my daughter and I were,
by Nellie Goode.

1201
01:32:28,608 --> 01:32:31,771
Yes, most inappropriate name.
I told her so.

1202
01:32:31,945 --> 01:32:35,711
She touched us for 24 pounds, and do you
know why I think it was well-spent?

1203
01:32:36,382 --> 01:32:39,647
- Though we could ill afford it.
- Come to the point, please.

1204
01:32:39,819 --> 01:32:43,949
Well, it struck me that what Nellie could do,
Doris could do.

1205
01:32:44,123 --> 01:32:46,284
I mean suppose she went
to Miss Inwood and said:

1206
01:32:46,459 --> 01:32:49,485
"Look, Miss Inwood,
I've got a certain dress of yours.

1207
01:32:49,662 --> 01:32:53,029
It's ruined, but it's still worth money."

1208
01:32:53,566 --> 01:32:58,469
And suppose Miss Inwood said, "All right,
I'll give you 100 pounds for it."

1209
01:32:58,638 --> 01:33:00,037
What then, eh?

1210
01:33:00,206 --> 01:33:03,972
And suppose you happened
to be listening.

1211
01:33:04,177 --> 01:33:07,669
Well, that's what police do
in blackmail cases, isn't it?

1212
01:33:07,847 --> 01:33:10,008
What about it, eh? What about it?

1213
01:33:10,183 --> 01:33:14,119
Oh, you needn't be afraid that Doris
couldn't do it. She could do it, Doris could.

1214
01:33:14,287 --> 01:33:18,383
I mean, Eve could. She's a very good
actress, a very good actress indeed.

1215
01:33:18,558 --> 01:33:20,219
I'm sure she is.

1216
01:33:22,962 --> 01:33:25,931
By the way,
is there a bloodstained dress?

1217
01:33:27,567 --> 01:33:30,161
Well, no. No, not exactly.

1218
01:33:30,336 --> 01:33:33,931
Look, there was
a bloodstained dress, only...

1219
01:33:34,107 --> 01:33:36,735
- Couldn't we tell you...?
- I'm getting back to the office.

1220
01:33:36,910 --> 01:33:39,037
I'll let you know about this later.

1221
01:33:42,849 --> 01:33:45,647
In the meantime, what's Miss Inwood
doing without a dresser?

1222
01:33:45,818 --> 01:33:49,515
You better run along to the theater before
she starts getting impatient.

1223
01:33:52,692 --> 01:33:53,920
It's all right.

1224
01:33:54,093 --> 01:33:57,062
- What do you mean, "It's all right"?
- He's trying to save face.

1225
01:33:57,230 --> 01:33:58,492
Not a bad face, either.

1226
01:33:58,665 --> 01:34:01,828
He'll let us do it. What's the matter
with you? Aren't you pleased?

1227
01:34:02,936 --> 01:34:05,268
Come on. We better hurry.

1228
01:34:05,872 --> 01:34:09,535
Come to Burton Street and bring two men.
Post them at either end of the street.

1229
01:34:09,709 --> 01:34:13,236
I'll be waiting at the telephone booth
at the corner. All right?

1230
01:34:32,031 --> 01:34:36,127
Hello. Is that Mrs. Gill?
Is the commodore available?

1231
01:34:36,302 --> 01:34:39,601
Oh, he's gone out. Is Miss Eve there?

1232
01:34:39,772 --> 01:34:42,400
Oh, she's out too. No, one moment.

1233
01:34:42,575 --> 01:34:45,476
May I speak to Mr. Robinson, please?

1234
01:35:03,930 --> 01:35:06,797
- What's your idea, governor?
- Just a little experiment.

1235
01:35:06,966 --> 01:35:09,400
- Plug it in.
- Okay.

1236
01:35:24,317 --> 01:35:26,376
<i>The mike's in position.</i>

1237
01:35:26,552 --> 01:35:30,044
<i>I'm speaking about three foot from it.</i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1238
01:35:31,457 --> 01:35:34,119
- Tell him the sound's all right.
- Okay.

1239
01:35:36,796 --> 01:35:38,923
Do you think it'll work?

1240
01:35:39,098 --> 01:35:40,588
What a day, darling.

1241
01:35:40,767 --> 01:35:43,702
I've never in my whole life been so glad
to see the end of it.

1242
01:35:43,870 --> 01:35:46,168
- Yes, madam.
- You must be tired too.

1243
01:35:46,339 --> 01:35:48,967
It can't be easy to be a dresser
with no experience.

1244
01:35:49,142 --> 01:35:52,509
But you're quite good.
Very good, indeed.

1245
01:35:52,679 --> 01:35:56,137
Oh, that rain.
That rain at the garden party.

1246
01:35:56,315 --> 01:35:59,842
Thank goodness it didn't rain at the funeral.
That would have been too much.

1247
01:36:00,019 --> 01:36:02,249
I hate rainy funerals.

1248
01:36:02,555 --> 01:36:05,149
And then somebody sent up
that disgusting doll.

1249
01:36:06,325 --> 01:36:09,055
What vermin some vermin are.

1250
01:36:09,228 --> 01:36:10,752
Yes, madam.

1251
01:36:11,164 --> 01:36:13,598
By the way, did the police find you?

1252
01:36:13,766 --> 01:36:15,631
I haven't seen them yet, madam.

1253
01:36:15,802 --> 01:36:17,997
And anyway,
I've got nothing to tell them.

1254
01:36:18,171 --> 01:36:19,832
Well, I suppose that's all.

1255
01:36:20,006 --> 01:36:23,032
And that horrible Nellie
will be back tomorrow.

1256
01:36:23,376 --> 01:36:27,676
We may never see each other again.
Ships that pass in the something or other.

1257
01:36:27,847 --> 01:36:32,682
I like you. You're so very sweet and patient.
I don't suppose I'm easy to get on with.

1258
01:36:32,852 --> 01:36:35,821
Oh, but you are, madam.
It's been wonderful working with you.

1259
01:36:35,988 --> 01:36:38,218
And I do love the theater so.

1260
01:36:38,391 --> 01:36:41,383
I don't see why. It's an awful life, really.

1261
01:36:41,561 --> 01:36:43,722
Here, darling.
A little something extra for you.

1262
01:36:43,896 --> 01:36:45,193
I couldn't, madam. Honestly.

1263
01:36:45,364 --> 01:36:49,391
Don't be an idiot. Put it in the bank
or go out and get drunk or something.

1264
01:36:49,569 --> 01:36:51,469
- Thank you, madam.
- Can I give you a lift?

1265
01:36:51,637 --> 01:36:55,334
- Lf you would drop me, I'd appreciate it.
- All right. Come along, then.

1266
01:37:04,617 --> 01:37:06,585
- Good night.
- Good night.

1267
01:37:13,059 --> 01:37:15,220
- Good night.
- Good night.

1268
01:37:18,064 --> 01:37:22,057
- Miss Inwood, could I talk to you in private?
- We can talk in the car. That's private.

1269
01:37:22,235 --> 01:37:24,362
No, that won't do.
I've got to talk to you now.

1270
01:37:24,537 --> 01:37:26,164
What's all this about?

1271
01:37:26,339 --> 01:37:28,830
Let's go someplace
where nobody can hear us.

1272
01:37:29,008 --> 01:37:30,635
Good night.

1273
01:37:32,779 --> 01:37:36,215
- Have you gone mad or something?
- No, madam.

1274
01:37:36,382 --> 01:37:39,613
I want to tell you about
the bloodstained doll.

1275
01:37:50,396 --> 01:37:52,523
Well, what about that doll?

1276
01:37:53,232 --> 01:37:56,326
Oh, I hate all this, madam.
I'm that nervous.

1277
01:37:56,502 --> 01:37:59,232
I'm so afraid of doing the wrong thing.

1278
01:37:59,405 --> 01:38:03,307
You see, I have a dress that belongs to you
with a big bloodstain down the front.

1279
01:38:03,476 --> 01:38:05,706
By rights, I know I should
go to the police...

1280
01:38:05,878 --> 01:38:08,403
...but, to tell you the truth,
madam, I'm afraid.

1281
01:38:08,581 --> 01:38:11,607
My dad would murder me
if I got my name in the papers.

1282
01:38:11,784 --> 01:38:14,947
<i>So, you see, I've come to you.</i>
<i>Maybe you could tell me what to do.</i>

1283
01:38:15,121 --> 01:38:16,554
<i>How much do you want?</i>

1284
01:38:16,722 --> 01:38:20,123
<i>Money never entered my head, madam.</i>
<i>I hope you won't think that of me.</i>

1285
01:38:20,293 --> 01:38:25,356
<i>Only if the dress were clean like new,</i>
<i>it might be worth, say, 75 or 100 pounds.</i>

1286
01:38:26,532 --> 01:38:28,500
I know nothing about
a bloodstained dress.

1287
01:38:28,668 --> 01:38:31,330
This sounds to me remarkably
like blackmail.

1288
01:38:31,504 --> 01:38:35,600
- I think I'd better call the police.
- Yes. Do call the police, Miss Inwood.

1289
01:38:36,776 --> 01:38:38,641
We'll talk to them together.

1290
01:38:39,612 --> 01:38:42,376
- You're not the maid.
- No, I'm not.

1291
01:38:44,717 --> 01:38:46,981
Why have you been pretending
all this time?

1292
01:38:47,954 --> 01:38:49,649
Shall we say we needed evidence?

1293
01:38:50,223 --> 01:38:53,420
We? Are you from the police?

1294
01:38:53,893 --> 01:38:56,453
<i>How was the bloodstain</i>
<i>smeared on the dress?</i>

1295
01:38:58,331 --> 01:38:59,320
Who are you?

1296
01:38:59,498 --> 01:39:03,025
Why were you so frightened when Jonathan
said he hadn't destroyed the dress?

1297
01:39:03,202 --> 01:39:07,263
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You do know!

1298
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:08,930
Yes.

1299
01:39:09,108 --> 01:39:11,099
Some blood did splash on my dress.

1300
01:39:11,277 --> 01:39:13,268
I was there when Jonathan
killed my husband.

1301
01:39:13,446 --> 01:39:16,142
- That's not true.
- It is, but I had nothing to do with it.

1302
01:39:16,315 --> 01:39:18,112
Jonathan wanted my name kept out of it.

1303
01:39:18,284 --> 01:39:19,808
He sent me back to his rooms.

1304
01:39:19,986 --> 01:39:22,682
He stayed behind to make it look
like robbery.

1305
01:39:22,855 --> 01:39:25,483
- Then he brought me a clean dress.
- You're lying.

1306
01:39:25,658 --> 01:39:28,183
It's a sacred truth. I swear to you it is.

1307
01:39:28,361 --> 01:39:29,692
<i>Listen, whoever you are...</i>

1308
01:39:29,862 --> 01:39:32,490
<i>... I'll give you anything</i>
<i>if you keep me out of this.</i>

1309
01:39:32,698 --> 01:39:35,667
<i>My jewelry is worth over 10,000 pounds.</i>
<i>You can have it all.</i>

1310
01:39:35,835 --> 01:39:38,633
<i>And my furs or money.</i>
<i>How much do you want?</i>

1311
01:39:38,804 --> 01:39:40,601
<i>I'll give you anything. Anything.</i>

1312
01:39:40,773 --> 01:39:43,901
I'm going now to break it up.
Bring them in. I want them together.

1313
01:39:44,076 --> 01:39:46,544
<i>You deliberately tried to pin</i>
<i>it all on Jonathan...</i>

1314
01:39:46,712 --> 01:39:50,204
...<i>assisted by Mr. Freddie Williams.</i>
<i>- It's not true, I tell you. It's not!</i>

1315
01:39:50,383 --> 01:39:53,443
<i>Well, you won't get away with it.</i>
<i>I warn you, that's all.</i>

1316
01:40:25,551 --> 01:40:27,644
I've had a terrible scene
with a lunatic girl.

1317
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:31,586
First she pretended to be my dresser,
then a detective and tried to blackmail me.

1318
01:40:31,757 --> 01:40:35,750
That's all right, Miss Inwood. You stay here.
I'll have a word with you in a minute.

1319
01:40:36,896 --> 01:40:39,660
Oh, good. They got him.

1320
01:40:41,133 --> 01:40:43,260
Jonathan, what have they done to you?

1321
01:40:43,436 --> 01:40:45,904
Why are you arresting him?

1322
01:40:46,072 --> 01:40:48,768
Mellish, stand by Miss Inwood there!

1323
01:40:49,008 --> 01:40:50,839
Heavens, that must be Cooper.

1324
01:40:51,544 --> 01:40:53,478
Where's Miss Inwood?

1325
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:56,874
Cover the alleyway in case he used
an emergency door.

1326
01:40:57,049 --> 01:40:59,017
- Where do those stairs lead to?
- Dressing rooms.

1327
01:40:59,185 --> 01:41:01,551
Eve! Eve, come back!

1328
01:41:01,721 --> 01:41:03,086
Where's the nearest telephone?

1329
01:41:03,255 --> 01:41:05,280
- Eve.
- He came through an emergency door.

1330
01:41:05,458 --> 01:41:08,393
Hurry up downstairs. Go on, hurry!

1331
01:41:08,561 --> 01:41:10,426
Get back into the theater.

1332
01:41:10,596 --> 01:41:12,621
Have you been told
to keep an eye on me?

1333
01:41:12,798 --> 01:41:15,289
In a manner of speaking, yes.

1334
01:41:16,602 --> 01:41:20,333
- In that case, may I sit down?
- No harm in that.

1335
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:22,305
Get me a chair, then.

1336
01:41:22,475 --> 01:41:24,636
Surely, ma'am. Surely.

1337
01:41:24,810 --> 01:41:26,209
<i>- Done with the mike?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

1338
01:41:26,379 --> 01:41:29,712
<i>Okay. I wonder if they caught...</i>

1339
01:41:36,389 --> 01:41:38,289
What's the point of going up to the roof?

1340
01:41:38,457 --> 01:41:41,858
He may have doubled back along the alley
and gone up the fire escape.

1341
01:41:42,294 --> 01:41:45,229
- So they've heard everything I said?
- Yes.

1342
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:52,159
- And it's all in that book?
- All in there, in shorthand.

1343
01:41:52,338 --> 01:41:54,329
How clever of you.

1344
01:41:56,042 --> 01:41:58,272
Things look bad for me, don't they?

1345
01:41:59,078 --> 01:42:02,844
I'm what you'd call an accessory...
I suppose.

1346
01:42:03,015 --> 01:42:04,243
- George!
- Yes?

1347
01:42:04,417 --> 01:42:07,477
Smith wants you down
at the stage doorkeeper's office.

1348
01:42:07,653 --> 01:42:08,642
Thank you, darling.

1349
01:42:08,821 --> 01:42:11,619
We'll need more men to cover
all the rooms in this place...

1350
01:42:12,625 --> 01:42:14,616
It's not all in there.

1351
01:42:16,095 --> 01:42:18,188
- What's your name?
- Mellish.

1352
01:42:20,933 --> 01:42:23,959
- Do you like dogs, Mellish?
- Yes, ma'am, I do.

1353
01:42:25,204 --> 01:42:27,604
But not all dogs.

1354
01:42:27,773 --> 01:42:30,139
If they don't love you,
you don't love them.

1355
01:42:30,309 --> 01:42:32,277
- That's right, isn't it?
- I suppose so.

1356
01:42:33,646 --> 01:42:37,241
I had a dog once. He hated me.

1357
01:42:37,416 --> 01:42:40,351
At last he bit me, and I had him shot.

1358
01:42:41,754 --> 01:42:46,885
When I give all my love and get back
treachery and hatred, it's...

1359
01:42:48,828 --> 01:42:51,854
It's as if my mother
had struck me in the face.

1360
01:42:54,533 --> 01:42:56,364
Do you understand that, Mellish?

1361
01:42:56,535 --> 01:42:58,730
I've heard it takes them
that way sometimes.

1362
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:04,339
Yes. It takes some of them that way.

1363
01:43:04,610 --> 01:43:06,908
- Has Miss Inwood gone yet?
- No, she's in the theater.

1364
01:43:07,079 --> 01:43:10,674
- Don't you think he's well away now?
- I'm sure I saw him run down the alley.

1365
01:43:11,117 --> 01:43:12,345
This is Smith.

1366
01:43:12,518 --> 01:43:15,385
We're covering the theater
from the roof to the storeroom.

1367
01:43:15,554 --> 01:43:17,579
- Fine, sir.
- You heard what Miss Inwood said.

1368
01:43:17,756 --> 01:43:19,724
You can't have anything
against Cooper now.

1369
01:43:19,892 --> 01:43:23,350
Nothing, except murder. He killed
Charlotte's husband, all right.

1370
01:43:23,529 --> 01:43:25,156
He's killed before.

1371
01:43:25,331 --> 01:43:27,322
What? What do you mean?

1372
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:31,129
He got away with it last time with a plea
of self-defense. He won't this time.

1373
01:43:31,303 --> 01:43:32,964
- But Eve.
- She's alone with him now.

1374
01:43:33,139 --> 01:43:35,903
Can't you see, sir?
She's in very great danger.

1375
01:43:51,423 --> 01:43:55,826
It all adds up to a confession,
except she said you killed him.

1376
01:43:55,995 --> 01:43:58,759
Anyone in their right mind
could see she was telling a lie.

1377
01:43:58,931 --> 01:44:01,991
But I don't understand why Smith
arrested you. What happened?

1378
01:44:02,168 --> 01:44:04,693
Somebody phoned and said
the police were on their way.

1379
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:08,499
I made a bolt for it, and they
grabbed me at the street door.

1380
01:44:09,208 --> 01:44:11,938
Funny, that.
Getting me out into the street.

1381
01:44:12,111 --> 01:44:15,774
I suppose Smith didn't want me
to be caught in your house.

1382
01:44:16,015 --> 01:44:18,381
That would have been awkward for you,
wouldn't it?

1383
01:44:18,551 --> 01:44:20,781
I don't think they'll look
for us here for a bit.

1384
01:44:20,953 --> 01:44:24,013
After a while, maybe we can make
a dash through an emergency exit.

1385
01:44:24,190 --> 01:44:29,992
Eve. Eve. Eve, wherever you are,
come away from him.

1386
01:44:30,162 --> 01:44:33,620
Come away from him.
He's dangerous. He's a killer.

1387
01:44:33,799 --> 01:44:36,393
Eve? Eve?

1388
01:44:39,238 --> 01:44:43,334
You're right, you know.
Charlotte was telling the truth.

1389
01:44:46,912 --> 01:44:50,040
What she didn't tell you was that
she goaded me into doing it.

1390
01:44:50,216 --> 01:44:52,707
She set me against him
in every way she could.

1391
01:44:52,885 --> 01:44:56,082
She made me think she was crazy
about me, but she wasn't.

1392
01:44:56,255 --> 01:45:01,090
I was to kill her husband to leave
the coast clear for that Freddie Williams.

1393
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:05,526
I know that now.
She knew the sort of man I was.

1394
01:45:05,698 --> 01:45:09,065
She knows I can't control myself
if I get into a rage.

1395
01:45:09,235 --> 01:45:12,068
Like a fool, I told her
about that girl I'd killed.

1396
01:45:12,238 --> 01:45:15,435
Oh, Jonathan. Jonathan,
you don't know what you're saying.

1397
01:45:15,608 --> 01:45:20,272
I can't help it, Eve. I can't control
myself, even when I was a kid.

1398
01:45:20,913 --> 01:45:25,316
I was lucky that last time. The little
fool threatened me with a gun.

1399
01:45:25,484 --> 01:45:29,045
But you don't know what it's like
to have a thing like this hanging over you.

1400
01:45:29,555 --> 01:45:35,824
Eve, I hated to tell you that
phony story in your car that time...

1401
01:45:35,995 --> 01:45:38,225
...but there was no other way.

1402
01:45:39,498 --> 01:45:43,457
Charlotte did go on to my flat
after I'd killed her husband.

1403
01:45:43,636 --> 01:45:48,630
Her dress was stained a bit,
so I brought her a clean one.

1404
01:45:48,807 --> 01:45:50,934
Then when she went to the theater...

1405
01:45:51,110 --> 01:45:53,840
...I made a big stain on it
to make you believe me.

1406
01:45:55,514 --> 01:45:58,312
I'm telling you the truth now.

1407
01:46:01,954 --> 01:46:03,819
Jonathan...

1408
01:46:05,157 --> 01:46:07,819
...I feel desperately sorry for you.

1409
01:46:07,993 --> 01:46:09,984
Really, I do.

1410
01:46:11,397 --> 01:46:15,390
No, you don't. You're not sorry at all.

1411
01:46:15,567 --> 01:46:17,159
You don't care what happens to me.

1412
01:46:21,807 --> 01:46:23,502
Jonathan...

1413
01:46:24,143 --> 01:46:28,637
...you could give yourself up.
They'd take care of you.

1414
01:46:28,814 --> 01:46:31,908
You couldn't do all these things
unless you...

1415
01:46:32,651 --> 01:46:34,380
Unless...

1416
01:46:35,988 --> 01:46:41,893
They can't do anything to a sick man,
and that's what you are. You must be.

1417
01:46:42,227 --> 01:46:47,290
No. They're going to hang me.
They'll hang Charlotte, too, for planning it.

1418
01:46:48,167 --> 01:46:51,830
They've never forgiven me for getting
away with it the first time.

1419
01:46:52,004 --> 01:46:57,374
There's nothing wrong with my mind.
Nobody can prove that there is, unless...

1420
01:47:07,986 --> 01:47:10,682
Unless I do it a third time...

1421
01:47:10,856 --> 01:47:14,053
...with no reason whatever.

1422
01:47:14,626 --> 01:47:18,460
That would be a clear case of insanity.

1423
01:47:19,231 --> 01:47:20,664
Wouldn't it?

1424
01:47:24,370 --> 01:47:25,894
Wouldn't it?

1425
01:47:38,550 --> 01:47:42,680
Jonathan. Jonathan,
I don't hear a sound now.

1426
01:47:43,822 --> 01:47:46,450
I think we can go now.

1427
01:47:46,625 --> 01:47:50,618
We'll go out through the orchestra pit,
and then I'll take you to my father's boat.

1428
01:47:53,432 --> 01:47:54,956
Come along.

1429
01:48:22,761 --> 01:48:24,661
Here he is!

1430
01:48:27,366 --> 01:48:30,096
Look! In the orchestra pit!

1431
01:48:33,472 --> 01:48:36,873
Mathews, quick! Down in the orchestra!

1432
01:48:43,348 --> 01:48:46,146
- They've got him!
- Where?

1433
01:48:46,385 --> 01:48:48,216
- They found him.
- Where was he?

1434
01:48:48,387 --> 01:48:50,912
- He was in the theater after all.
- Call Smith!

1435
01:48:51,089 --> 01:48:54,718
- He was at the stage doorkeeper's office.
- Drop the iron curtain, cut him off!

1436
01:48:54,893 --> 01:48:57,020
Get out! Move your head
out of the way!

1437
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:10,932
- Take the curtain up.
- Don't touch anything.

1438
01:49:11,109 --> 01:49:14,044
Mellish, you'd better phone
up the photographer.

1439
01:49:14,279 --> 01:49:18,613
Someone find out if Byard's here yet.
Tell him what's happened.

1440
01:49:53,819 --> 01:49:55,810
