1
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,120
- Any sign of the police?
- No, no sign.

2
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,280
- Looks like we're getting away with it.
- Good.

3
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,160
- How far is it to your father's boat?
- Two hours with luck.

4
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,920
Your luck seems to be very good,
touching wood.

5
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,760
Could you tell me now what happened?
I'd really like to know.

6
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,200
Only if you feel like it.

7
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,440
It's Charlotte lnwood.

8
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,120
- She's in a jam.
- That doesn't surprise me.

9
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,040
No, this is serious, Eve.
Deadly serious.

10
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,120
She was all over the place.
I had to help her. Anybody would have.

11
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,520
I was in my kitchen. It was about 5:00.

12
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,480
The doorbell rang, and I went downstairs
to see who it was.

13
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,480
Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,480
Jonnie, you love me. Say that you
love me. You do love me, don't you?

15
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,520
I think he's dead. I'm sure he's dead.

16
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,680
I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it.

17
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,320
- Who's dead?
- My husband.

18
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,440
We had a terrible quarrel about you.

19
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,840
Oh, he was vile.
You know the sort of things he can say.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,640
He started to hit me.
I grabbed something.

21
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,160
I was out of my mind with fear.
Oh, what am I to do?

22
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,280
Darling, pull yourself together.
He may not be.

23
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,360
The curtains, Jonnie. Draw the curtains.

24
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,680
I thought I had some brandy.

25
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,880
Here, drink this.

26
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,640
He was an abominable man.

27
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,680
Why do women marry abominable men?

28
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,520
- Where was all this?
- ln my bedroom.

29
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,560
- Anyone else in the house?
- I left the servants in the country.

30
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,760
I drove up early to have an hour's rest
before the performance.

31
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,520
Oh, what shall I do?
I can't go on. I can't.

32
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,040
- Has anyone seen you?
- No. I don't think so.

33
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,720
There wasn't a soul in the street.
I jumped into my car and came here.

34
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,480
It's parked around the corner.

35
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,880
Oh, Jonnie, what will they do to me?

36
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,120
Don't tremble like that. We'll find a way.
We'll see you're all right.

37
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,920
But you must call the theater.
I can't play tonight.

38
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,240
Tell them I'm ill.
Heavens, it'll be true enough.

39
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,640
No, you must go on tonight.
You've got to.

40
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,320
As if nothing had happened.
Nothing has happened.

41
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,960
You drove straight to the theater,
do you understand?

42
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,520
You haven't been home at all.
Now, get that into your head.

43
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,160
But my dress. There's blood on it.

44
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,200
- I must go back and change.
- No, you can't do that.

45
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,400
Or I could go myself.

46
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,320
Oh, darling, could you?
There's no one there.

47
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,960
I'd give you the key.

48
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,440
There's a blue dress like this
in the big cupboard...

49
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,000
...next to my window in the bedroom.
Here's the key.

50
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,000
- Are you sure the servants aren't back?
- No, but you must hurry. Oh, please, Jonnie.

51
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,360
This is my only chance.

52
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,520
- You will, won't you?
- It's a risk.

53
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,160
Let me think a minute. I mean....

54
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,760
Well, you know I want to help you, but....

55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,400
Go or don't go. It's all the same.

56
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,600
I thought you loved me.

57
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,480
- Doesn't matter now.
- Oh, my dear. My darling.

58
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,080
I'd do anything for you. You know that.

59
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,880
I'll be as quick as I can.

60
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,600
It was your maid, Nellie.

61
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,000
Oh, yes.

62
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,880
She was going to the house to pick up
some shoes I need for the show.

63
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,680
- Did she recognize you?
- I don't know.

64
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,680
You ought to get to the theater. The police
are bound to go there to tell you the news.

65
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,360
Give me my belt, darling, will you?

66
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,840
Oh, Jonnie, what have I done to you?

67
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,800
If Nellie recognized you,
it won't be safe here.

68
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,560
- You ought to go away.
- I don't think that'll do much good.

69
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,320
But they'll come here.
You must go at once.

70
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,760
Oh, my dearest darling,
you have saved me.

71
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,440
We must think of you now.
You've got to hide.

72
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,280
What do I care what happens to me?

73
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,360
Your job is to try to forget everything.

74
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,240
Let me do the worrying. I'll find a way.

75
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,000
Then we'll start again,
won't we, you and l?

76
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,720
No more stealth and cheating and lying.

77
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,040
I must hurry, darling.
But I worry about you.

78
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,520
Well, you mustn't. You're an actress.
You're playing a part.

79
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,680
- No nerves when you're on.
- I'll try.

80
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,480
My dress!

81
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,600
- I'll get rid of that. Don't worry.
- Don't come down.

82
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,640
We shouldn't be seen together.

83
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,520
- Au revoir, my darling.
- Au revoir.

84
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,040
And for heaven's sake, don't worry.

85
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,400
- Yes?
- May I speak to Miss Eve Gill, please?

86
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,560
Oh, dear, no. I'm afraid she isn't in.

87
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
She was going for the weekend
to her father...

88
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,960
- ... but I thought she'd be back.
- Yes, that's right. She got back last night.

89
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,240
She's had rehearsals all day today
at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

90
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,520
You know, the RADA.

91
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,560
Do you know when she--?
Where she is now?

92
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,560
Didn't you hear?

93
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,040
She's at the RADA rehearsing.

94
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,640
- Jonathan Cooper?
- Yes.

95
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,320
We're police officers.
May we see you for a few minutes?

96
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,800
Most certainly. Please come in.

97
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,520
--tell you that I can't possibly
accede to your request.

98
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,920
I've come to this decision after giving
the matter my earnest consideration.

99
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,720
Stop me if ever there was
such an ungrateful child!

100
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,400
No, darling. Don't run your words
into one another.

101
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,400
--the child most shamefully.

102
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,280
Is it not in your memory
that we, too, years ago...

103
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,120
...suffered the follies and fevers of youth?

104
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,360
If our blood runs cooler
and more temperate, let us not account...

105
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,400
...to ourselves for virtue, but place it
to the credit of the soothing balm...

106
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,360
...of the passage of years
that we have fortifications...

107
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,880
...against the distempers of juvenility.

108
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,480
You were wont to be kinder than this.

109
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,280
No, Papa, you are cruel.
If all parents were of your mind...

110
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,240
...marriage would be an impossibility. Then
what would become of the human race?

111
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,360
- Go away. What are you doing here?
- The police are after me. Do you see them?

112
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,600
You have not, I hope,
forgotten the tragedy....

113
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,520
They think I killed a man.
Can you hide me on your father's boat?

114
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,520
Are you so heartless as to wish...?

115
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,840
They've just gone.

116
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,960
I was under the impression that this
was a class of intelligent students...

117
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,840
...trying to master an extremely
difficult and beautiful art.

118
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,760
I haven't the pleasure of knowing you,
young man...

119
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,240
...but I shall report your behavior
to Sir Kenneth.

120
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,000
Now we will begin the rehearsal again,
with the other cast.

121
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,720
- This cast think acting is fun and games.
- I'm terribly sorry, Miss Ashton.

122
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,640
- Oh, Jonathan.
- Let's go. Have you got your car here?

123
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,840
It's parked in front. I'll show you
to the back entrance and pick you up there.

124
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,040
Eve, do you hate me...

125
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,480
...now that you know
about Charlotte and me?

126
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,280
Why, I could never hate you, Jonathan...

127
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,920
...because we're--
We're such old friends.

128
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,920
And....

129
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,200
Well, just because.

130
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,000
But I do wish I'd taken lessons
on the second fiddle.

131
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,920
Good old Eve.

132
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,320
Bring him in here.

133
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,440
It's warmer.

134
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,560
Do you think I behaved like a fool?

135
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,520
On the whole, I think so.

136
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,440
I think your boyfriend
has behaved like a fool.

137
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,440
I have a strong premonition
that I'm going to behave like a fool.

138
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,480
- It's infectious.
- Do you mean you're going to help him?

139
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,080
Why not?

140
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,560
He's a friend of yours, isn't he?

141
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,320
- Oh, yes.
- I see.

142
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,160
More than a friend, eh?

143
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,440
When I'm with him, I get a feeling
in here that-- That's sort of--

144
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,520
Yes. Well, we'll go
into the symptoms later.

145
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,680
Meanwhile, I take it you're either
keen on him or still hungry.

146
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,840
I'm in love with him.

147
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,960
You've roped him, but he's not yet
broken to harness. Is that it?

148
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,360
I wish Charlotte lnwood was in....

149
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,200
Oh, do you?

150
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,920
I've seen her on the stage.

151
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,440
She'd have made me laugh,
if I hadn't been strictly on my guard.

152
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,000
Well, she couldn't make me laugh,
off or on the stage.

153
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,800
I can't bear to sit by and see
what she's doing to Jonathan.

154
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,080
She's like an evil spirit.
Just look at him!

155
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,440
Ruined, and by a woman.

156
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,320
Now you want me to take the ruins
for a little cruise.

157
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,200
- Well, is that it?
- I thought you could take him...

158
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,640
...across the channel or to the lrish coast.
Then he could hide out a bit.

159
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,760
The journey sounds attractive,
but less so...

160
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,320
...to help a suspected murderer to escape,
particularly with my reputation.

161
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,240
There's nothing wrong
with your reputation.

162
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,960
Oh, indeed.
I rather flattered myself that there was.

163
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,880
As a matter of fact, the customs people
have their eye on me.

164
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,040
I'm suspected of being a smuggler.

165
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,160
- Well, you're not.
- Oh, yes, I am.

166
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,800
One cask of brandy?
That doesn't mean you're a smuggler.

167
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,600
- Two casks.
- That was 15 years ago.

168
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,480
I've done one or two other things since
that I didn't tell you or your mother about.

169
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,480
- Can't have been very much.
- Of course not. Not very much.

170
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,200
Nothing could appear very much
to a murderer's moll.

171
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,320
But I never hope to be appreciated.

172
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,400
Yes, your mother cured me of that.

173
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,960
That's why I never could be bothered
with your mother.

174
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,720
I appreciate you, Father. You and
Captain Kidd are my favorite heroes.

175
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,400
My child, I am not deceived.

176
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,600
If there's one thing I cannot bear,
it's insincerity.

177
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,640
But you've got to help him.
You will help him, won't you?

178
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,600
He's lonely. He hasn't got any friends
but me, and maybe you.

179
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,800
- You will help him, won't you?
- He hasn't got me...

180
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,240
...yet.

181
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,800
You're just dying to get into a part of this,
and you know you are.

182
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,440
A part in this melodramatic play,
you mean?

183
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,320
That's the way you're treating it, Eve.

184
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,160
As though it were a play
you were acting in at the Academy.

185
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,040
Everything seems a fine acting role
when you're stage-struck...

186
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,880
...doesn't it, my dear?

187
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,360
Here you have a plot,
an interesting cast...

188
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,320
...even a costume,
little the worse for wear.

189
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,920
Unfortunately, Eve,
in this real and earnest life...

190
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,440
...we must face the situation
and all its bearings.

191
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,320
Yes.

192
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,200
What do you mean?

193
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,440
Well, Miss Charlotte lnwood
appears to be an expert in garden paths.

194
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,520
I think she's led your young friend
up the garden path.

195
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,960
I think we should hesitate
before we follow him.

196
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,120
- But why?
- I don't know how this bloodstain...

197
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,200
...got onto this dress, but I do know that
somebody smeared it on deliberately.

198
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,800
But why should they do that?

199
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,280
Well, Miss lnwood is an actress,
a very good one.

200
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,640
She has an eye
for an emotional situation.

201
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,920
Supposing she wanted our somnolent
young friend to go to her house...

202
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,440
...and be spotted there.

203
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,400
Well, this sanguinary garment
would provide a very plausible reason.

204
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,960
A very plausible reason indeed.

205
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,440
So that's why she didn't change her dress
before she went to his rooms.

206
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,560
Well, I cannot imagine Miss lnwood
going to see her young man--

207
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,080
Or your young man, whose ever young man
he is, in this nasty, messy condition.

208
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,840
No. This dress is a clue, my dear,
a very important clue.

209
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,920
And though it grieves me, of all people,
to have to say it, Eve...

210
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,400
...I think we should go to the police.

211
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,240
Jonathan! Jonathan, wake up.

212
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,920
Jonathan, how far do you think
you could trust Charlotte?

213
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,280
I'd trust her with my life.
What do you mean?

214
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,800
This bloodstain was put here deliberately.

215
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,520
Don't be ridiculous. You're trying to turn me
against Charlotte, but you can't.

216
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,000
What's this doing here, anyhow?
It should have been destroyed hours ago!

217
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,560
Fool! There goes the evidence
that could've helped you.

218
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,760
I'm doing all this for Charlotte's sake.
You're just jealous of her!

219
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,200
Young man, I'd remind you
you're my daughter's guest.

220
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,840
I'd like better manners from you.

221
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,800
Oh, I am sorry, Eve.

222
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,720
Please forgive me.

223
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,080
I lost my head for a moment.

224
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,560
I can hardly think.
I'm almost dead for want of sleep.

225
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,600
I wonder, would it be too much trouble
if I went to bed?

226
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,720
That is, if Commodore Gill
wants to let me stay.

227
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,120
Your room is at the head of the stairs.
You'll be quite comfortable.

228
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,160
And if you want anything to read in bed...

229
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,000
...you'll find some quite good
murder mysteries in there.

230
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,840
Beg your pardon.

231
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,800
Look, Eve--

232
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,640
But he's just gone--

233
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,480
At last we are alone and unobserved.
You know, I'm beginning to enjoy this.

234
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,600
Father, do you think she arranged
to put the suspicion on Jonathan?

235
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,120
- Do you think she deliberately framed him?
- The thought had crossed my mind.

236
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,120
That was why I reluctantly suggested that
our friends, the police, ought to be told.

237
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,000
But it's too late. Our only evidence
has gone up the chimney.

238
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,400
But we must help him.
He'll do nothing for himself.

239
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,800
He's hopelessly in love with that woman.
It's up to us.

240
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,480
Yes, but it won't be easy.

241
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,880
It is easy.
I'll go to her and see her myself.

242
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,480
- Would that be wise?
- But I don't care if it is or not.

243
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,960
I'll tell her we know how the bloodstain got
on the dress and every move of her game.

244
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,000
I'll make her talk.
It'll be one woman to another.

245
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,080
An impressive situation at any time.

246
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,880
She won't be able to help
but give herself away. You'll see.

247
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,080
I won't see. I won't be there,
and neither will you.

248
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,720
If we're right in what we think,
she's a dangerous woman.

249
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,360
She won't give herself away.
You'd be giving her an alternative.

250
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,760
She has no alternative.

251
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,120
She might murder you.

252
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,280
Oh, don't be so melodramatic, Father.

253
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,080
Look, my love. Face facts.

254
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,720
What is the least that can happen to you
if you tackle this remarkable lady?

255
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,360
She'll at once pick up a little pink
telephone and call the police.

256
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,360
She will then give you in charge
for concealing a fugitive from justice.

257
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,880
Eventually, you will be tried
at the Old Bailey.

258
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,880
Well, if you're lucky, you might get off
with, now, let me see...

259
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,400
...a couple of years, which you will spend
in Holloway prison...

260
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,280
...meditating on the folly of transmuting
melodrama into real life.

261
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,600
Well....

262
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,960
The best thing you can do, my girl,
is to go back to your Academy...

263
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,040
...and practice your soul-shaking antics...

264
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,800
...in surroundings where
they can't do any harm.

265
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,560
After all, this fellow can't possibly
mean all that to you.

266
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,720
But he does, Father.

267
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,840
- Move along, please.
- But I'd like--

268
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,360
Now move along, ma'am.
This is nothing to see.

269
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,480
Hello, Father?
I'm outside the lnwood house.

270
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,600
Outside? Why not inside?

271
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,960
Don't be ridiculous, Father.
The police won't let anyone near the place.

272
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,360
Really? How very extraordinary.

273
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,560
Look, you've done your best.
Come back here...

274
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,200
...and decide about the man
that came to dinner.

275
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,280
Oh, I feel awful. I've been listening
to the people in the crowd talking...

276
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,480
...and they assume that
you-know-who is guilty...

277
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,760
...and all the police have to do
is catch him. It's terrifying.

278
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,920
Yes, but the police may not
think he's guilty.

279
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,000
After all, they work in secret, you know.

280
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,080
They may have their own ideas
about a certain lady.

281
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,760
I wish I knew what
the police were thinking.

282
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,000
- Well, look, why not ask them?
- Well, that's easier said than done.

283
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,040
Oh, just a minute, Father.

284
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,080
- Father, goodbye now.
- Eve--

285
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,400
I'll see you back at the office
about 2:00, sir.

286
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,440
May I have a small brandy, please?

287
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,640
Madam. Pardon my intrusion,
but is there, by any chance...

288
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,640
- ... any assistance I could be of?
- No, thank you.

289
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,480
- I don't know how you pick up all the dirt.
- Oh, I get around.

290
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,400
Any case, I know Munson's....

291
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,240
Right from the horse's mouth.

292
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,960
I most solemnly assure you, madam...

293
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,560
...it would be a pleasure, if there was
any assistance I could be of.

294
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,960
Thank you very much.

295
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,520
If you will allow me to say so,
you look depressed.

296
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,120
Yes, the cheering word,
the helping hand--

297
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,360
I'm perfectly all right.

298
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,520
Oh, good. Right. Good, good.

299
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,760
Is there anything I can do?

300
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,480
Look, I don't know your trouble,
but you don't look very well to me.

301
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,240
A little brandy can't do you any harm.
Why not drink it?

302
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,240
My great-aunt died over a glass of brandy,
but it was her 15th that day.

303
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,760
- Feeling any better?
- Yes, thank you.

304
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,320
You left your lunch over there.

305
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,760
It won't feel lonely.
I'll go back to it in a minute.

306
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,640
Perhaps you're allergic to bars.
Look...

307
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,240
...would you feel less uneasy
if I sat with you, or more so?

308
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,480
- Perhaps you're allergic to strange men too.
- No. I love strange men.

309
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,880
- I mean, I'm very fond of them.
- I'll just go and get my lunch.

310
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,200
The butler told me. Never saw such a sight.
They say his head was bashed in.

311
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,480
I heard they clocked him so hard his
false teeth went across the room.

312
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,880
I know I'm pretty silly, but I overheard
two people on the street today...

313
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,960
...talking about the murder.

314
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,520
They went into a lot of detail.

315
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,160
I felt so sick and giddy,
I just had to come in and have a brandy.

316
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,880
My father says I tend
to overdramatize everything.

317
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,360
I expect he's right. I know how you feel,
though. I hate violence myself.

318
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,280
Doesn't that make it
rather difficult for you?

319
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,960
I mean, I think we ought to face up
to the ugly side of life.

320
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,200
Now, me, for instance.
I'm an actress.

321
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,480
I ought to face up to all sorts
of experiences, oughtn't l?

322
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,400
Oh, I don't know. Supposing I happened
to be a librarian.

323
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,800
A librarian doesn't encounter much violence
except an occasional encyclopedia falling.

324
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,120
But you're not a librarian, are you?

325
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,240
No, I'm not. How do you know?

326
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,600
Well, you just don't
look like a librarian.

327
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,960
- You don't look like an actress.
- Oh? I thought I did.

328
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,640
Well, I'm only a beginner, really.
That is, I've only played one part in public.

329
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,360
- Could I have seen you?
- I don't think so.

330
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,320
It was in the church hall.
I played the fourth deadly sin.

331
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,840
- Were you good?
- I was pretty deadly.

332
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,600
What was this Jonathan Cooper after?

333
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,720
- I heard there was nothing stolen.
- Perhaps he did it for the fun of it....

334
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,080
Poor Charlotte lnwood.

335
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,920
Imagine coming home and finding
your husband horribly dead...

336
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,840
...policemen and detectives
all over the house, and the blood--

337
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,200
Careful, careful.

338
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,560
Remember, you're sensitive to that sort
of thing. You'll bring on another fainting fit.

339
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,160
I hear that Charlotte lnwood's going back
into the show in a couple of days.

340
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,120
Must be dreadful to sing and dance...

341
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,840
...with that horrible picture
still burning in one's mind.

342
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,400
Oh, it's the old story, "ls not the actor
the man with a heart?" all over again.

343
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,800
I once had a cousin
who had a duodenal ulcer...

344
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,360
...and an extremely funny face,
both at the same time.

345
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,760
Everybody laughed
when he was telling his symptoms.

346
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,200
His name was Jim.

347
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,120
That must have been terrible.

348
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,840
Oh, I don't know.
Jim's quite a common name.

349
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,560
I wonder what Charlotte lnwood
is really like. Really, I mean.

350
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,160
- Oh, hello, Nellie.
- That's Charlotte lnwood's maid.

351
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,960
Hello, Nellie. I didn't expect
to see you so soon.

352
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,040
How are you bearing up after last night?

353
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,800
Mrs. Tippet, what I've been through.
All those policemen.

354
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,800
Bothering you with a lot of questions.

355
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,240
Questions? They've been asking me this,
asking me that, all morning long.

356
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,280
I didn't know whether
I was coming or going.

357
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,000
Gin and lemon, please, Mrs. Tippet.

358
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,680
- Not too much lemon, dear.
- Okay.

359
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,560
Mind you, they never laid a finger on me,
but, oh, the questions. Nag, nag, nag.

360
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,040
"How did you know it was Mr. Cooper?
How many times you seen him and where?

361
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,160
And did he give you anything? "
Blimey, he never gave me nothing.

362
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,120
"And how long you been
Miss lnwood's maid?"

363
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,360
They was gentlemanly and polite,
all right...

364
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,840
...but give me the bleeding Russians
any day, dear.

365
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,840
Yes. You gotta watch your step
when you're up against the police.

366
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,400
If that wasn't enough,
when I came out of the house...

367
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,880
...the reporters pounced on me with their
questions, asking me the lowdown.

368
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,120
I just jumped out of my skin when that
photographer's flashbulb went.

369
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,800
Well, I mean, fancy taking my picture.

370
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,240
You're quite a celebrity, you lucky girl.
I'll have to buy the Daily Mirror tomorrow.

371
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,240
Of course, I'm not saying a word
to the reporters. Not a word.

372
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,760
After all, who discovered the body?

373
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,560
I'll be a star witness at that trial, and my
story ought to be worth something...

374
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,880
...and I've no intention of giving it away.

375
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,480
- lsn't she talking too much?
- Too much, too loud, too everything.

376
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,440
How do you feel now?

377
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,920
Oh, I feel a little better, thank you.

378
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,480
I have to go.

379
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,240
I don't like leaving you here alone.

380
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,400
Do you feel fit enough
to let me see you home?

381
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,480
- I have a car.
- Perhaps you'd better let me drive it for you.

382
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,000
Well, that's very kind of you.
I do still feel a bit wobbly.

383
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,920
To be quite honest, it isn't kindness at all.
I mean, I'm afraid I maneuvered it.

384
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,280
How clever of you.

385
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,640
You've got something there, Fred.
I'll drink to that, on you.

386
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,080
A double gin and lemon, please.

387
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,880
Double? All right, Nellie,
I hope it chokes you.

388
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,320
You don't miss a trick, do you?
You're always on the make.

389
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,840
My mother's really a dear. My father, too,
but they shout at one another...

390
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,720
...and neither one like to shout.

391
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,840
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this.

392
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,280
You've been extraordinarily kind and
you know nothing whatsoever about me.

393
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,440
Oh, I don't know, Miss Gill.

394
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,400
You were born in South Africa.
The 17th of September, wasn't it?

395
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,000
Educated in America and you're studying
at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

396
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,760
Your parents don't live together.

397
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,680
You're a very well-behaved lady, but allergic
to murder, and that drove you to drink.

398
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,040
I hope it's only temporary.

399
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,360
But I don't even know your name.

400
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,200
I only know that you play the piano.

401
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm so sorry. It was stupid of me.
I forgot. My name is Smith.

402
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,680
Just ordinary Smith?

403
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,720
A detective?

404
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,880
I hope you don't mind.

405
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,560
Oh, no. Of course not.

406
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,440
Well, I'm delighted.

407
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,200
By the way, I don't suppose you and
your mother are interested in tea...

408
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,640
...with a detective, that is.

409
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,960
Of course. Especially with a detective.

410
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,840
- Would you like to have tea with us?
- Oh, I'd love to. How about this afternoon?

411
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,560
- Well, tomorrow, then?
- Yes.

412
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,080
Yes. That's fine.

413
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,480
And I could take your place.

414
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,880
You'd never get away with it. What
makes you think you could be a maid?

415
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,560
It would only be for a day or two.

416
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,960
You'd have to be her dresser
down at the theater.

417
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,880
You couldn't do that.
That's very highly skilled work.

418
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,600
- Well, I could if you told me how.
- lt sounds phony to me.

419
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,440
All this trouble just to get
a newspaper story.

420
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,600
Well, we women reporters have
a tough job competing with the men...

421
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,800
...especially on
important stories like this.

422
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,120
And what paper are you on, may I ask?

423
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,440
Well, I can't tell you that.

424
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,760
If anything should go wrong,
it would be embarrassing for the paper.

425
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,640
Oh? And what about my job?

426
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,800
Suppose Miss lnwood found out
I was passing you off as my cousin.

427
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,640
I'm not sure she won't smell a rat.

428
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,440
I never been away ill for years.

429
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,800
But anyone could go sick.
And I could do it, really I could.

430
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,560
I've-- I've done a bit of acting.

431
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,560
Character acting?

432
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,680
- Yes.
- I see.

433
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,680
All you gotta do is put on some old clothes
and make yourself look common like me.

434
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,200
Let me explain why it's so important
that I get the right slant on this.

435
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,800
I think there's a romance between
Miss lnwood and this man named Cooper.

436
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,800
And where did you get this idea?
Do you know what I think?

437
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,240
- I think you're snooping for the police.
- Oh, no--

438
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,440
I saw you this morning sitting
on this very seat with a detective.

439
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,960
Oh, well, that was Wilfred Smith.

440
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,320
He's an old friend of mine.
I didn't get a thing out of him.

441
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,440
Charlie, double gin and lemon, please.

442
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,640
- Not too much lemon, dear.
- Same for me.

443
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,040
I can get five times that much
from any newspaper when the case is over.

444
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,040
Why not get both?

445
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,520
Caught you, have l?

446
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,080
Hope I don't intrude
on some deep conspiracy.

447
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,000
And I hope you find yourself no worse
for your distressing experiences.

448
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,480
Haven't I met your charming
friend before? I know that face.

449
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,880
This is my cousin Doris, Mr. Fortesque.

450
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,400
Oh, yeah. Charming. Charming.

451
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,400
Perhaps as dear Nellie didn't
provide me with your surname...

452
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,920
...you'll let me call you Doris, eh?

453
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,520
Mrs. Mason, I can't think what I've done
with my reading glasses.

454
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,480
Have you seen them anywhere?

455
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,200
- Could l--?
- Oh, there you are.

456
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,560
Help me find my glasses, Eve, darling.
I can't see a thing.

457
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,600
I'm Doris Tinsdale.

458
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,080
I'm from Nellie.

459
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,560
Move along there, please.

460
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,080
I'm Doris Tinsdale.

461
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,920
- Miss lnwood's expecting me.
- Oh, yes.

462
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,840
You're the temporary Nellie sent along.

463
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,360
Just wait over here a minute.

464
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,160
We'd like to see Miss lnwood.
Can I have a few words with you as well?

465
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,480
By all means.
Will you step this way, please?

466
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,440
I understand you've been in service
now for six or seven years.

467
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,440
Six years and nine months,
to be precise....

468
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,280
Come in.

469
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,600
Okay, yes. I'll come around
the box office tonight.

470
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,000
- What did they say, Freddie?
- More cancellations.

471
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,680
Oh, how stupid people are.

472
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,480
Even if my understudy's legs
are so peculiar...

473
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,640
...she's just as good as I am.

474
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,880
She knows darn well she'd better not be.
That's not the point.

475
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,320
It's you they want to see.

476
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,880
- Well, what do you want?
- I'm from Nellie.

477
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,280
Madam's expecting me.

478
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,160
The new girl's here, Charlie.

479
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,240
No, no. This doesn't fit me.

480
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,600
Here, here. Pull it up on this side.
The other side too.

481
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,840
You know that, don't you?

482
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,760
Excuse me, madam.

483
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,160
Read it to me, dear.

484
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,880
"Dear Madam, this will introduce
my cousin Doris...

485
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,640
...who is in every way a good girl. "

486
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,920
Not so loud.

487
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,800
"l hope you'll find her satisfactory
during my illness. Signed, Nellie Goode."

488
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,880
This is very nice,
if you can call mourning nice...

489
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,320
...but isn't there some way we could let it
plunge a little in front? I suppose not.

490
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,960
"Signed, Nellie Goode."

491
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,240
If we could only work in a little
color somewhere. Oh, well.

492
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,720
"Signed, Nellie Goode."

493
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,640
Take off your hat, dear.

494
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,360
There are simply millions
of things to do, I'm afraid.

495
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,760
You won't mind if I depend
on you a great deal?

496
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,640
Thank you, darling.

497
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,240
Now, get me out of these weeds.
I'm beginning to feel sad, and I shouldn't.

498
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,640
It's so depressing.

499
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,840
See who that is.

500
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,880
What's your name?

501
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,680
Doris Tinsdale, madam.

502
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,040
Yes? What is it, Groves?

503
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,040
Divisional Detective lnspector Byard...

504
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,480
...and Detective lnspector Smith
to see you, madam.

505
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,080
Good heavens.

506
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,400
Hear that, Freddie? The police again.

507
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,080
- Show them up, Groves.
- Very good, madam.

508
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,200
I thought I told you to wait downstairs.

509
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,840
Hand me a negligee from that cupboard
over there, will you, Phyllis?

510
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,600
Now, what about this dress for
the theatrical garden party, Miss lnwood?

511
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,080
Black? Oh, yes, of course.

512
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,320
How clever of you to remember, darling.

513
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,600
Hold that for me, will you?

514
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,440
- Freddie.
- Yes?

515
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,520
We haven't decided. Am I going
to the theatrical garden party?

516
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,400
I don't feel an atom like it.

517
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,200
I keep thinking about those
dreadful cancellations.

518
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,320
I don't see why.
They're a compliment to you.

519
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,080
Hand me a comb and mirror
from over there, will you?

520
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,520
But they do cut down the takings.

521
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,240
I think I could appear tonight,
if you insisted.

522
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,240
Wouldn't it be a terrible strain for you?

523
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,640
Oh, ghastly.

524
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,280
But I can't help feel
for my poor, dear, loyal public.

525
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,560
Looking towards it for weeks...

526
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,040
...and then trailing back sadly
with their tickets...

527
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,480
...getting their money returned.
I simply can't bear it.

528
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,440
It would be pretty trying.

529
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,560
Waves of sympathy coming on the stage...

530
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,960
...all the gangways flooded with tears.

531
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,160
I can hardly bear the thought myself.

532
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,480
No use trying to stop me.
I'm going on tonight.

533
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,560
Be at the theater at 6:00 sharp, will you?

534
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,480
- Yes, madam.
- Take this away.

535
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,600
You go right ahead, dear.
Garden party dress and everything.

536
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,680
And why don't we let ourselves
go a trifle just in front, huh?

537
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,320
And thank you so very much.

538
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,560
What do you suppose
the police wants now?

539
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,920
I don't know.

540
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,920
Must you speak to me
with your mouth full?

541
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,080
They've probably come to look under
your bed for Master Cooper.

542
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,920
What could I tell them about Cooper?
I know nothing about him.

543
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,720
Tell them just that.

544
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,600
Listen.

545
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,080
That's a good idea.

546
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,680
Elsie, darling, come here.

547
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,360
Now, I want you to wait
in the other room and listen.

548
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,600
When you hear me cough, you come
in and say, "The doctor's here."

549
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,960
Yes, madam.

550
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,920
You can stand just so much of detectives.

551
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,400
After all, they are only policemen
with smaller feet.

552
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,280
- ln here?
- The next door, sir.

553
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,040
What's the matter with Nellie?

554
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,640
Oh, it's her stomach, sir,
if you'll excuse the expression.

555
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,080
The tragedy and excitement
was too much for her.

556
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,600
- Highly strung type, eh?
- Oh, very, sir.

557
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,000
I suppose you know, Miss lnwood,
that whatever Cooper's motive was...

558
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,200
...it certainly couldn't have been robbery.

559
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,760
Of course, darling. I understand that.

560
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,840
I suppose he just tried
to make it look like robbery.

561
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,000
What's your name again?

562
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,640
- Doris, sir.
- You know, Doris, you're not bad-looking.

563
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,800
- Thank you, sir.
- You don't treat your face properly.

564
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,000
If you fixed your hair and used makeup,
you'd be quite attractive.

565
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,920
I suppose I shouldn't have seen him
as often as I did.

566
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,520
But I didn't realize how madly
infatuated he was with me.

567
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,880
I just didn't realize.

568
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,920
You'll never know how much
I blame myself for all this.

569
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,440
When my husband came back
from New York last week...

570
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,480
...and I told Jonnie I couldn't see him...

571
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,120
...he kept on phoning me.

572
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,040
He wouldn't let me alone.

573
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,440
Oh, maybe if I had agreed to see him...

574
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,600
...he wouldn't have done
this dreadful thing.

575
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,760
- When did you last see Jonathan Cooper?
- Let me think.

576
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,280
It must have been a week....

577
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,360
A week before my husband died.

578
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,720
- Go on. What are you waiting for?
- Did he come to this house?

579
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,760
Excuse me, madam.
The doctor's waiting to see you.

580
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,720
Oh, I'm so sorry, darling,
but I will have to see my doctor.

581
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,560
I'm feeling wretched.
I've been trying to get him all morning.

582
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,880
You see, I'm going on tonight.

583
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,080
The producer has insisted so much.

584
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,360
And I don't want to see him
ruined because of me.

585
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,120
That's all right. I think
we've covered most of the points.

586
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,160
If there's any more I can help you with,
you will let me know?

587
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,920
Thank you. We'll try not
to trouble you again.

588
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,280
Thank you.

589
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,560
You're so understanding.

590
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,160
And so are you.

591
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,480
Doris, show the gentlemen out.

592
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,960
It's all right, thank you. We can
find our own way downstairs.

593
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,440
Freddie.

594
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,880
Mavis, go to the kitchen
and get yourself some tea.

595
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,040
- I'll ring when I need you.
- Yes. Thank you, madam.

596
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,280
- Darling, where is Jonathan?
- Friends may be hiding him.

597
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,680
He had no friends, only me.

598
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,880
I hope he hasn't made any and hasn't
taken them into his confidence.

599
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,840
For your sake, his sake and their sake.

600
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,880
- What do you mean?
- lf the truth comes out, it would break you.

601
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,880
- I can't have that.
- What could you do?

602
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,080
You know me.
You know how it is with me.

603
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,640
- You make me afraid.
- Not l. You don't know what fear is.

604
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,840
Oh, that would be most lovely.

605
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,800
Of course,
you must be fond of swimming.

606
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,840
But I am, yes I am,
very fond of it.

607
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,840
I go out to the country
to find somewhere to swim.

608
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,880
You don't live in the country? Oh, dear.

609
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:10,280
Of course, we miss the rain so much, don't
we? All the flowers. It's so disappointing.

610
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,040
I really must apologize for Eve, Mr...?

611
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,480
- Was the name Smith?
- Smith, yes.

612
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,360
Smith.
The name seems familiar, somehow.

613
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,400
I can't understand
why that girl is so late.

614
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,680
I mean, she's usually so punctual.

615
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,040
She takes that from me.
Her father isn't punctual.

616
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,040
He catches trains and things,
but always at the last moment.

617
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,840
I'm there at least an hour before.

618
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,920
Yes. I'm sure you are.
I have heard a lot about you, Mrs. Gill.

619
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,120
Oh, have you? Is Eve very fond of me?

620
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:42,920
Have you known her long, Mr. Smith?
I've got the name right now, haven't l?

621
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,280
I've known her
for about a day and a half.

622
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,280
That's not very long.

623
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,680
Where did you meet?

624
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,000
As a matter of fact,
we met in the saloon bar of a pub.

625
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,600
Well.

626
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,640
How interesting.

627
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,080
Thank you.

628
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,000
- Am I intruding?
- This is Mr. Smith.

629
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,040
Mr. Smith, this is Eve's father.
We see him now and again.

630
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,000
- How do you do, sir?
- Very well, indeed. Thank you.

631
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,040
- Do sit down.
- Thank you.

632
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,680
- Where's Eve?
- She should be here by this time.

633
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,080
She asked Mr. Smith to tea.

634
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,920
Oh, good, good.
Anyone else coming?

635
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,400
I mean, going to be a party?
I am fond of parties.

636
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,000
No. There's no one else coming,
and you weren't invited.

637
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,240
Wasn't l? Oh, an oversight.

638
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,720
But I forgive you.

639
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,480
Forgiveness, Mr. Smith.
The secret of a happy married life.

640
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,080
That and good long stretches of the
absence that makes the heart grow fonder.

641
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,680
There you are, my dear.
The last but four of the Mahicans.

642
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,680
- Will you forgive me, Mr. Ordinary Smith?
- Yes. I've just been set an example.

643
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,040
Yes, but he says his name
is just plain Smith.

644
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,000
He did? I'm terribly sorry to be late...

645
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,280
...but the rehearsal went on and
the awful part is, I have to go back.

646
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,160
- lt was decent of you to have come.
- What are you doing here?

647
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,000
- I've been trying to reach you all day.
- I took the boat out.

648
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,960
We had quite a little cruise.

649
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,080
Jonnie and me.

650
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,240
Poor old Jonnie.
I hope his rheumatism is better.

651
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:10,320
Do play something, Mr. Smith.
Mr. Smith is a pianist, Mother.

652
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,400
Well, I think that's a delightful career.

653
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,320
- I often wish I'd kept up my practicing.
- It's not exactly my career, Mrs. Gill.

654
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,360
But you must play for us.
Make him, Mother.

655
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,240
But I haven't even started my tea yet.

656
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,640
But of course he hasn't.
Eve, you are ridiculous.

657
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,720
But I've got to leave in a minute.
Please play.

658
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,200
You know, Jonnie's not
much of a sailor, Eve.

659
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,240
He was abominably seasick.

660
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,320
In fact, as soon as we got ashore,
Jonnie ran away.

661
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,880
- Who's Jonnie?
- I wish I knew.

662
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,600
He's about 57 different varieties.

663
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,440
Roughly speaking, he was a dog of some
sort that strayed in a couple of nights ago.

664
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,000
- Do the police know about him?
- No, no. I'm not worried about him.

665
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,640
I daresay he'll find his way
back to his old master.

666
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,160
Or mistress.

667
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,880
I thought we might have to ask
for your help, Mr. Smith.

668
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,520
Mr. Smith is a detective, Mother.

669
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,240
Mrs. Mason.

670
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,440
A detective. How very unusual.

671
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,640
I suppose you have
many fascinating cases.

672
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,800
- Must be very exciting.
- Not very, I'm afraid.

673
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,240
- Embezzlement, fraud, petty thefts.
- Smuggling?

674
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,120
Yes. Occasionally. Brandy mostly.

675
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,320
Murder, too, sometimes, Father.

676
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,000
Mr. Smith is working on the lnwood case.

677
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:25,560
Oh, you don't say so.
Yes, I read about that somewhere.

678
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,800
How did you know?

679
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,960
I saw your photograph in the paper.

680
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,600
What is the fellow's name, Clippen.

681
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,640
Cooper, Cooper.
Did he do it, do you think?

682
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,560
He has run away and remained in hiding.

683
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,760
We're inclined to accept the obvious
as being obvious.

684
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,320
Oh, it's just like Sherlock Holmes
and his fiddle.

685
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:03,480
A stream of beautiful sound,
and then suddenly out pops the solution.

686
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,320
- Oh, I must run.
- So must l.

687
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,440
- I don't know what you'll think of me.
- I like people bound up in their work.

688
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,360
- You'll make a very good actress indeed.
- Au revoir, my pet.

689
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,280
Meet me at the stage door....

690
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,880
- Can't I drive you back to the Academy?
- No. I want you to get to know Father.

691
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,400
Not professionally,
but he's a wonderful character.

692
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,360
- They'd be hurt if you didn't stay.
- When will I see you again?

693
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,520
- Well, I really don't--
- Ring me tomorrow first thing. Regent 1113.

694
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,920
I know you think I'm an idiot,
but I'm not. I'm doing darn well.

695
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,440
Yes. You're giving a very good show.
A very good show.

696
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,800
- Pity you've no audience.
- But you're my audience.

697
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,520
I wish you'd give me a little
applause now and then.

698
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,560
- I wonder when Jonathan will turn up.
- Turn up where?

699
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,880
Wherever Miss Charlotte lnwood
happens to be.

700
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,880
Good heavens, she'll only turn him over.

701
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,480
Yes, and to your nice new friend,
Mr. Smith.

702
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,280
Who was that man?

703
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,560
Oh, that was my dad, madam.

704
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,360
I told him about my temporary job,
and he doesn't like it.

705
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,640
What with the murder and all.
You know, madam.

706
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,160
What's it got to do with him?
Or with you?

707
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,520
My dad says that man on the run
might turn up here.

708
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,760
Might even get into the dressing room.

709
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,720
Might even murder me, madam.

710
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,040
It's the scene of the crime the murderer
returns to, not the theater.

711
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,880
He might be right, my dad.

712
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,360
I'm surprised you're not
a bit afraid yourself.

713
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,360
Slippers.

714
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,920
This theater's the last place
he'd want to be seen in.

715
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,320
Now, stop acting like a silly schoolgirl.

716
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,800
The only murderer here
is the orchestra leader.

717
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,640
Father, you've got to keep on the lookout
and head Jonathan off.

718
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,760
Right. Certainly, my dear.

719
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,200
This is desperate.

720
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,440
Go on, go on, go on.

721
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,360
Madam, madam.

722
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,040
- What?
- Madam, there's a man.

723
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,440
- He's gone up to your dressing room.
- What are you talking about? What man?

724
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,960
I saw him. Don't go up there.
It's dangerous.

725
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,880
You're an imbecile.

726
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,920
You needn't come up.

727
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,840
I'll manage to change myself.

728
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,720
I know, Jonnie, darling,
but what a terrible risk you've taken.

729
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,760
- I couldn't keep away.
- You haven't told me where you've been.

730
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,120
Some friends looked after me.

731
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,080
- What friends?
- Never mind that just now.

732
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,080
We've got to work out
a plan of campaign.

733
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:08,080
- Everything is going on beautifully.
- We've got to get a story...

734
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,600
- ... and we'll both have to stick to it.
- I must change.

735
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,600
You shouldn't have come here, Jonnie.
You have been so wonderful up to now.

736
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,320
Don't think that I'm ungrateful.
I'm not. Truly, I'm not.

737
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:23,480
- I don't know how I shall ever repay you.
- Repay me?

738
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,120
You talk as though this were a favor.

739
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,240
Something that a "thank you"
can take care of.

740
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,200
Dearest, you mustn't be foolish.
You must go away at once. Back to...

741
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,000
...where you were hiding.

742
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,560
Freddie's going to get you
out of the country soon.

743
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,400
And I'll come to see you,
when the run of the show's over.

744
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,920
Why, that may be months,
maybe a year, or more.

745
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:47,440
Well, you know how it is. We were
playing to capacity before this happened.

746
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,480
Now they're hanging on to the chandeliers.

747
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,160
Fifty pounds up tonight.

748
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,480
Goodness knows how they squeeze them in.

749
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,440
Yes. I could only get standing room.

750
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,040
Well, there you are.

751
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,760
We'll find a lovely place,
South America or somewhere.

752
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,400
And I'll come out to you, as soon
as all of this has blown over.

753
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,320
I'll be glad of the rest for a week or two.

754
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,600
Palm trees...

755
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,320
...sunshine.

756
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,720
Lovely.

757
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,160
A week or two?

758
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,400
Well, you don't want me to give up
everything, do you?

759
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,000
Why not? I have.

760
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:32,120
Now, Jonnie, I thought you said that
my happiness was all that mattered...

761
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,600
...and you must admit that
you behaved as if it was.

762
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,440
Taking all the trouble
to protect my reputation...

763
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,120
...covering up the accident...

764
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,360
...destroying that dreadful dress
with the bloodstain on it.

765
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,040
I didn't destroy it.

766
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,360
You didn't?

767
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,800
Jonnie, you promised.

768
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,040
Don't you realize if they find the dress....

769
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:02,760
So long as I have that dress, I'm the one
who decides how long this show will run.

770
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,280
And everything else.

771
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,320
Do you understand?

772
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,320
Where the devil is Miss lnwood?
The orchestra's started her number.

773
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,840
My socks and suspenders, where is she?

774
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,200
Take this. I'll change downstairs.

775
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,360
Sorry, darling. A hook broke.

776
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,520
Just a minute, Charlie.
Jonathan Cooper's in the theater.

777
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,320
The sergeant's seen him.
He was sure to make for your room.

778
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,960
- Have you seen him?
- Of course not. What a stupid idea.

779
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,400
I think I better take a look
at your dressing room.

780
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,440
Doris, show Sergeant Loomis where to go.

781
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,440
- Freddie, there's something--
- Miss lnwood, please.

782
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:44,160
Doris, what are you waiting for?

783
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,880
Oh, Mr. Loomis, I feel so queer.
It's my heart.

784
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,480
The doctor told me I should
take the stairs easy.

785
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,080
You don't think he'll try to shoot
his way out, do you?

786
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,680
He might be desperate, sergeant.

787
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,360
Don't you think you ought
to go back and get a policeman?

788
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,560
She was glad he got away, Father.

789
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,160
- How do you know?
- By a look she gave Freddie Williams.

790
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,040
" Look she gave"? That won't get you far.

791
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,960
She'd be more delighted if she knew
there was no stained dress.

792
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,320
Oh, yes.

793
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,400
- I wish we still had that dress.
- There's so very little time.

794
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,080
We've got to make every minute count.

795
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,800
I have to phone Smith tomorrow.

796
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,680
Why don't I invite him to the theatrical
garden party with me?

797
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,040
I have to sell programs there.

798
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,880
- I don't quite follow you, my dear Holmes.
- ln order to make him see.

799
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:18,440
Nobody suspects our Charlotte yet,
and they've got to.

800
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,760
First, you'd see my mother and father
and get approved by them.

801
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,720
Most parents nowadays don't seem
to care what sort of people...

802
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,240
...their children go around with,
but I'm not like that.

803
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,760
I know I'm very old-fashioned,
but I've got to think of Eve.

804
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,200
What do you do for a living?

805
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,560
I write a bit.

806
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,600
What, novels and things?

807
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,160
I'm very fond of novels. You know,
I read a delightful one the other day.

808
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,040
Let me see. What was the title?
It was written by that woman.

809
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,560
I can't remember, but she's written
a number of books.

810
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:51,000
You must have read some of them.
They're all about charming people.

811
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,200
She only writes
about the nice side of life.

812
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,200
Now, this book I was telling you about...

813
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,800
...the title has just slipped
my memory for the moment.

814
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,960
Well, it's about a mother, which is
a nice idea, I think, don't you?

815
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,240
One reads so much
about the younger generation.

816
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,440
It does seem a brilliant idea
to have a change.

817
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,920
Now, this mother isn't old--

818
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,200
I'm sorry to turn up so late,
but I'm stranded for the night.

819
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,800
All the hotels are full.
My flat's uninhabitable.

820
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:17,240
I told you, it's in the hands
of the decorators.

821
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,040
I know it's a frightful imposition...

822
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,040
...but I wondered if you could
give me a shakedown somewhere?

823
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,680
Well, of course we can.

824
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,120
Can't we, Mother?

825
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,160
Well, it's a little awkward.

826
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,920
Is your father proposing
to stay here too?

827
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:34,600
Well, Jonathan could have my room,
and I could sleep on the settee.

828
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,720
Where shall we put your father?

829
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,840
No. I'll sleep on the settee,
and you can sleep with your mama.

830
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,160
- I hate to put you to all this trouble.
- Not at all, Mr...? What is your name?

831
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,520
- Jones.
- Brown.

832
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:52,520
Robinson. Now, Mr. Robinson,
I think we'll make it bye-byes.

833
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,600
A blanket for the commodore,
and we'll all go to bye-byes.

834
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,640
Robinson. I've heard that name before.

835
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:06,200
No, it won't do. Has Eve gone mad,
turning the house into a hotel in the night?

836
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:09,160
Who is this man, anyway?
What is his name?

837
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,200
Well, perhaps you better not mention it.

838
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,840
The fact is that he's
a fugitive from justice.

839
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,240
The whole police force is on his heels,
and Eve....

840
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,480
Well, for reasons of her own, my dear,
doesn't want him to be caught.

841
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,040
He's....

842
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,560
He's wanted for murder.

843
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,040
Now you're going too far.

844
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,800
I suppose you think I believed that
that Mr. Smith, who came here to tea...

845
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,640
...was a real detective.

846
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:42,920
If I hadn't heard her maid's voice outside
the dressing room, they'd have got me.

847
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,800
Eve, darling, I know I should
never have trusted her.

848
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:49,640
Darling, you've been wonderful to me.
I don't deserve it, but I need you.

849
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,920
I need you more than ever.

850
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,160
Tonight, when I found
what Charlotte was...

851
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,600
...all of a sudden,
I thought my brain would burst.

852
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,520
After all that I'd done for her.

853
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:01,920
Everything I did for her was because
I loved her and she loved me.

854
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,880
- I'm so sorry.
- Why the umbrella?

855
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,440
It is a garden party, isn't it?

856
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,120
Oh, Roehampton Club, please.

857
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:34,440
It couldn't be helped, I'm afraid.
You must blame a Miss Doris Tinsdale.

858
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,080
Who is Doris Tinsdale?

859
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:41,640
She's Charlotte lnwood's temporary dresser.
We've been searching for her all afternoon.

860
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,400
One of our men at the theater...

861
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:46,840
...Iet her slip through his fingers
without making a statement.

862
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,840
You look very lovely.

863
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,320
You're very sweet to say so.

864
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,440
What has this Doris Tinsdale person
got to do with the case?

865
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,160
Or shouldn't I ask, Mr. Smith?

866
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:01,680
Well, Cooper was at the theater last night,
and we think she saw him.

867
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:05,360
And don't call me Mr. Smith.
After all, my name is....

868
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,000
Wilfred.

869
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,360
Not very good, is it?

870
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,040
It suits some people very nicely.

871
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,640
I rather liked it when you called me
"Ordinary Smith."

872
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:19,160
- Oh, I didn't mean to, really.
- But I liked it. I liked it very much.

873
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,600
Please go on calling me that, will you?

874
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,560
Yes, I will.

875
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,040
What were we talking about?

876
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:33,600
Oh, yes. I was going to ask you,
why did Cooper risk going to the theater?

877
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,080
He must have had a very strong reason
for wanting to talk to Miss lnwood.

878
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:41,320
- Let's not talk shop on a day like this.
- Oh, I am sorry.

879
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,280
Do you hate inquisitive people?

880
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,840
Of course not. I'm one myself.

881
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,800
But seriously, Ordinary, do you think there's
anything between Cooper and Miss lnwood?

882
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:57,800
Seriously, " Extraordinary,"
I shouldn't be a bit surprised.

883
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,360
What a curious person she must be.

884
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:09,720
I mean, going back on the stage
so soon after everything.

885
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,520
The show must go on.

886
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:15,720
A smiling face, a breaking heart.
Actors rather like it, I'm told.

887
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,880
But today...

888
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,920
...going right from the funeral
to the garden party.

889
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,200
I must say, I think that's
overdoing things a bit.

890
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:28,440
A strong sense of the dramatics
and all that sort of thing.

891
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,040
It's...

892
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,440
...so cold and calculating of her.

893
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,480
Is it?

894
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,040
Yes, it is.

895
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:47,080
If she's that cold and calculating,
I was wondering...

896
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,640
...maybe she had something to do
with her husband's death.

897
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,200
Were you?

898
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,080
After all...

899
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,840
...there must be a lot
that doesn't appear on the surface.

900
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:02,200
I mean, like...

901
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,680
...wheels within wheels.

902
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,040
Who--? Who knows what goes on
in a woman's mind?

903
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,920
I don't know.

904
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,400
And if I don't know, l....

905
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,000
Well...

906
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,160
...who?

907
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:22,520
A woman's mind sometimes....

908
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:27,080
I was saying that a woman's mind....

909
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,880
That's right.

910
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,560
Do you really?

911
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,640
I think so too.

912
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,880
In Miss lnwood's case?

913
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,320
What?

914
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,360
What?

915
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,480
I have to report to the committee tent
to get my programs.

916
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:18,800
--whether to give it to the orphans
or to let the government take it.

917
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I'm putting it to you!

918
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,840
There's the committee tent over there.

919
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,200
You do understand I won't be able to spend
the whole afternoon with you?

920
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:29,720
Can't I go with you? I can sell a mean
program. We bloodhounds have methods.

921
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,600
But you must go and amuse yourself.
I can't take you with me.

922
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:36,080
Every time I begin to think I know
what color your eyes are, you disappear.

923
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:40,080
But it's against the rules. Now please go.
I'll pick you up later. I'll get in trouble.

924
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:44,600
Right here. Step right up.
Yes, madam. Over here....

925
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:48,280
Eve, you brute. Wherever have you been?
You're hours late.

926
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:51,000
- I'm sorry, Chubby.
- What a day. What a day.

927
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,600
- Hello, Valerie.
- Hello, Eve.

928
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,640
Oh, this is Wilfred Smith.
Chubby Bannister and Valerie Maynard.

929
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,240
They're at RADA with me.

930
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,120
- Well, how do you do, Mr. Smith?
- How do you do?

931
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,800
I'm sure you'd love some ice cream.
Chubby could show you where it is.

932
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,160
- Oh, but I'd adore to.
- That's most good of you.

933
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:08,880
I hope you'll remember me by this little
token of my regard and esteem.

934
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,000
Allow me.

935
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:15,320
As you know, this fete is being held
for the aid of the Actors ' Orphanage.

936
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,960
Now, it's raining outside, and if you've
got half a pound to spare, come in....

937
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,400
Which programs shall I take?

938
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,720
- Take that pile, dear.
- Thank you.

939
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:36,040
You newspaperwomen work hard
at your job, don't you, Miss Gill?

940
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,480
How did you know my name?

941
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,680
Called that number you gave me
for emergency.

942
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,400
A Mrs. Gill answered,
and I put two and two together.

943
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,800
- What did you need me for in such a hurry?
- Don't talk to me like that.

944
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,720
I've come down here to tell you
Miss lnwood's looking for you.

945
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,840
- What does she want?
- She wants your head, of course.

946
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,360
What's more, she said the police want
to talk to a Miss Doris Tinsdale.

947
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,840
She wants to know when I'm going
back to my work.

948
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,040
I told her my stomach
was still out of order.

949
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,640
Well, it's better now.

950
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,840
- Much better, thank you.
- You want more money, don't you?

951
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,240
Well, look at the risk I'm running. I'd better
go to Miss lnwood and tell her everything.

952
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:14,120
And before that detective finds out
there's no such person as Doris.

953
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,400
Here's 5 pounds. It's all I have with me.

954
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:21,480
Oh, my job's worth more than that,
at least another 20.

955
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:25,000
I'll meet you outside Miss lnwood's tent
in half an hour.

956
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,960
Finished already? You are doing well.

957
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:35,320
- May I use your phone?
- Why, yes, of course, my dear. There it is.

958
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,000
Thank you.

959
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,400
Hello. Is that you, Father?

960
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:49,080
Could you come right away? With all
the money you can lay your hands on.

961
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,440
At least 20 pounds. At least!

962
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,280
It's Nellie.

963
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,800
The girl I'm understudying.

964
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,960
Yes. Be quick, darling.

965
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,600
No queuing.

966
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,960
No queuing here.
Step right up.

967
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:05,400
Yes, madam, over here....

968
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,640
Doris, isn't it?

969
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,440
Yes, sir.

970
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:17,200
Yes, sir. I took your advice, sir.
I done myself up.

971
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,560
I mean, what do you think of it?

972
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:22,080
- Where have you been?
- Oh, I can explain it, sir.

973
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,920
- Only yesterday--
- Come along. I'll take you to Miss lnwood.

974
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,840
Come on, hurry.

975
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:33,160
Roll up, roll up, roll up. Come and have
a good time. Come on, sir. You, sir....

976
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,280
Miss Tinsdale to see you.

977
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,600
Well, this is a pleasure. Where have
you been? I thought you were dead.

978
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:44,400
Oh, no, madam. I wasn't.
As a matter of fact--

979
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:48,600
You needn't go into detail. I hope you're not
turning into one of those explicit people...

980
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:51,520
...who always tell you exactly
how they feel when you ask them.

981
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,720
You did leave me a trifle suspended,
however.

982
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,600
I'm sorry, madam.

983
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,280
I was held up.

984
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,000
Darling!

985
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,960
Whatever happened to that
peculiar figure of yours?

986
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,200
It's a new dress, madam.

987
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,960
Keep it, dear.

988
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:09,200
What it does for you is worth thousands.

989
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,760
I bought it at a sale.

990
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,760
Don't confide in me.
Just pour some tea, would you?

991
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,280
By the way, Doris...

992
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,480
...did Nellie tell you the police
want to talk to you?

993
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,880
But whatever for, madam?

994
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,000
Oh, I hope they won't upset my dad.

995
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:29,880
- My dad said--
- They're not going to eat you, darling.

996
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:33,840
It's not important. Just pull yourself
together and pour the tea.

997
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:41,120
Rehearsals from morning till night.
If we wanted to misbehave...

998
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,600
- ... we couldn't find a minute to do it in.
- No.

999
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:47,080
Yes, so I understand. Eve tells me she kept
hard at it all day and evening.

1000
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:50,920
But Eve hasn't been near for days. I thought
she was home with a cold or something.

1001
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,960
- Maybe she's got a job in a show.
- Gosh.

1002
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:57,800
A fortune in five minutes,
and there's no income tax on it tonight.

1003
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,200
Excuse me, madam. I've....

1004
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:16,360
I've got to sneeze.

1005
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,640
- Miss Livingston, I presume.
- That's not my name.

1006
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:45,400
Oh, no, no. It's Nellie Goode, isn't it?
But what does the name matter?

1007
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:48,760
After all, I could think of lots of much
more appropriate names for you.

1008
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,280
Yes, I could think of a few for you too.
Who are you?

1009
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,080
I understand my daughter has entered
into a somewhat shady transaction.

1010
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:59,840
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Well, you are a blackmailer, aren't you?

1011
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,520
You know, that's a very,
very naughty thing to be.

1012
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:06,200
Don't say things like that to me.
You could be had up for a thing like that.

1013
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,720
Now, don't be so peppery.

1014
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:11,040
- I like to keep things on a friendly basis.
- One short.

1015
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,440
It's all I've got. You don't want
me to walk home--

1016
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,560
I don't care if you crawl home.

1017
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:20,120
Oh, well, it doesn't matter. I'm not mean.
And you've got till tomorrow morning.

1018
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,800
Father, Freddie Williams, Charlotte's
manager, spotted me as Doris.

1019
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,280
I had to go into Charlotte's tent.

1020
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,880
If there's one thing I hate,
it's saying I told you so.

1021
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,240
And the police want to talk to Doris.
I don't know which way to turn.

1022
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,800
I think I'll get Smith
and tell him the whole story.

1023
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,080
Have you got him to suspect
Charlotte yet?

1024
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,960
I'm afraid not.

1025
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:43,680
But I thought you had to pick him up at
Whitehall. Didn't you talk to him about it?

1026
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,360
But, yes, I did...

1027
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,720
...in a way.

1028
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,480
In a way?

1029
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:53,680
Oh, I see.

1030
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:57,480
Some more important topic arose
in the conversation.

1031
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,760
Only there's one slight complication,
my dear: Jonathan.

1032
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:04,200
You're not, by any chance, thinking
of changing horses in midstream?

1033
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,400
Father, is it awful of me?

1034
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,120
Not awful, my dear,
just rather a bad bit of timing.

1035
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,280
No matter how my feelings
toward him change...

1036
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,640
...I still can't let Jonathan down, can l?

1037
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,240
Not while he's hiding in our house.

1038
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:31,920
Call yourself an actress? There's your
big scene, if you have the pluck to take it.

1039
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:35,800
You have the law on your arm. All you have
to do is rush in there and shout, "Stop!

1040
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,680
That woman is a murderess! "

1041
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,360
And then she'll say, " How dare you?"
And you'll say, " I'll dare and dare again.

1042
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:45,240
What about the bloodstained dress,
eh, Miss Charlotte lnwood? "

1043
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:49,000
- And then she'll say--
- Please. This is serious, Father.

1044
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:52,160
- Oh, Eve! There you are.
- I couldn't find you anywhere.

1045
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:56,760
- I've been trying to get rid of my programs.
- I've been too busy talking to sell mine.

1046
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,400
Do you think I talk too much?

1047
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,280
No. Most women don't talk enough.

1048
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:04,080
- I hate shy women.
- No one could ever call me shy....

1049
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,480
Who'll come over to shoot
some lovely ducks?

1050
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,920
It will only cost you half a crown,
and it does such good for the orphans.

1051
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:35,280
Who'll come and shoot lovely ducks
here for half a crown?

1052
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,440
Only half a crown to shoot lovely ducks!

1053
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,560
Eve.

1054
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,160
Excuse me.

1055
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:51,440
Look, Eve, hold everything.
I have an idea.

1056
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:55,920
Get Smith into Charlotte's tent,
as near the front as you can.

1057
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,160
Go on, quickly.

1058
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:02,720
- What do you say we hear Charlotte sing?
- Oh, do let's.

1059
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,720
The murder makes her so interesting.

1060
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:10,040
- You know, I think I'll wait outside.
- But you promised.

1061
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:13,200
- I promised?
- ln the taxi.

1062
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:16,400
You said the first thing we'd do would be
to go hear Charlotte lnwood.

1063
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,120
Don't you remember?

1064
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,160
Do you know? I can't remember.

1065
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,480
I must have had some sort of a blackout.

1066
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,920
- Oh, do let's hurry. We'll miss her.
- I think she's just dreamy.

1067
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,960
Only half a crown to shoot a lovely duck!

1068
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,240
You can win a lovely prize!
Heavenly prizes!

1069
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,840
Only half a crown to shoot--
Would you like to shoot?

1070
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,080
No, no. I hate firearms. I wonder
if I could buy one of those dolls.

1071
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,400
- A doll?
- Yes, please.

1072
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,280
- Which doll?
- Oh, any doll. That doll.

1073
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:45,720
- I suppose, but you'll have to pay for it.
- I know, but how much, please?

1074
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,600
- Well, it's for the orphans.
- Yes, I know, but how much?

1075
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:52,240
- You are sorry for the orphans, aren't you?
- Of course I am, but how much?

1076
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,280
We all are, aren't we? Well, I suppose...

1077
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,360
...at least four pounds.

1078
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,880
- Give me the gun.
- Well, half a crown, then.

1079
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:05,200
- Yes.
- You know. Money first.

1080
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,200
- Now, shall I put it in for you?
- Yes, please.

1081
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,280
It breaks somewhere here. I can't....

1082
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,320
It's rather....

1083
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,320
Perhaps I can manage.

1084
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,960
Wait a minute. I think you'll have to do
it yourself. I'm not frightfully good.

1085
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,640
Be rather careful, won't you?
You know, it goes off.

1086
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,680
Got you again, my beauty.

1087
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,800
My bird, I think, sir.

1088
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,320
Could I have the doll, please?

1089
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,360
What did you say?

1090
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:38,920
Good shot, sir.

1091
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,640
Well done. I'll get you your doll.

1092
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:47,080
Here you are, sir. Now, then,
who's going to shoot lovely ducks?

1093
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:49,080
Would you like to shoot lovely ducks?

1094
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:51,640
- Yes. Half a crown's worth.
- You sure that's enough?

1095
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:55,720
Oh, yes, certainly. Yes, I don't need
any more. I very seldom miss.

1096
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:06,320
Oh, got it at last. Could I have
the doll, please?

1097
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,320
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm afraid that's mine.

1098
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:11,120
What did you say?

1099
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,320
Nothing at all.

1100
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:17,520
- Could I have the doll, please?
- Well done. I'll go and get it for you.

1101
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:20,200
It is rather nice, I think,
to have won it, don't you?

1102
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:24,120
You did earn it that time. They're lovely
dolls. They're fully dressed. Fully.

1103
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:25,720
Thank you very much.

1104
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:29,560
Now, who's going to come and shoot lovely
duck over here for only half a crown?

1105
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:33,400
We're having such fun over here shooting
duck for only half a crown!

1106
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:02,560
Eve.

1107
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,000
I'm sorry.

1108
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,080
Ladies and gentlemen.

1109
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:04,080
Doris. Doris!

1110
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,960
Miss Tinsdale!

1111
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,520
Come and give a hand here.

1112
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,280
What are you waiting for?

1113
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,520
I'm sorry, sir.

1114
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:43,880
Do you think there's anything between
Cooper and Miss Inwood?

1115
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:46,040
But Eve hasn 't been near for days.

1116
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,000
Doris! Miss Tinsdale!

1117
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,840
We got away as quickly as possible,
and here we are.

1118
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,800
And that's the story of the short
and stormy life of Doris Tinsdale.

1119
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,240
It is in many respects a sad one,
but, one hopes...

1120
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,760
...not entirely without usefulness.

1121
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,800
The next thing is to wait
for the arrival of Mr. Ordinary Smith...

1122
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,520
...with his posse to arrest
the whole boiling lot of us.

1123
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:08,720
Well, you think I should give myself up,
is that it?

1124
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:12,760
Yes, I should, shouldn't l? The longer
I stay here, the worse it will be for you.

1125
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:16,320
But I won't give up. There must be
a way to get at Charlotte.

1126
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:20,120
Now, I've made a nice hot toddy
for you, Mr. Robinson.

1127
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:22,600
There's nothing like it for a cold,
is there?

1128
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,120
Thank you.

1129
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:28,480
Isn't it dreadful? Mr. Robinson hasn't been
able to stir out of his room since he arrived.

1130
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,520
These spring colds are really frightful.

1131
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:34,240
Oh, by the way, Eve, Mr. Smith
is downstairs and wants to see you.

1132
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,120
I think it would be such a good idea...

1133
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:39,640
...if I made Mr. Robinson a nice,
hot mustard plaster.

1134
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,720
I wonder if he's got a temperature.

1135
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:45,360
I've broken my thermometer, but you could
easily run to the chemist's....

1136
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:04,880
How long have you been
Miss lnwood's maid?

1137
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:09,320
As I think you know, we've been anxious
to ask Doris Tinsdale a few questions.

1138
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,840
- I can explain--
- Did you talk to Jonathan Cooper last night?

1139
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:15,080
- No.
- Did you see him?

1140
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,200
- Yes.
- Where?

1141
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,440
On his way to Miss lnwood's dressing room.

1142
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:23,120
He was there when she went up to change.

1143
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:26,080
I listened at the door and overheard
him say something about...

1144
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:28,720
...a bloodstained dress belonging to her.

1145
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:31,280
And then suddenly, she became afraid.

1146
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,400
Do you hear? Afraid.

1147
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,000
When you took Sergeant Loomis
up to the room...

1148
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:38,200
...you presumed Cooper to be still there?

1149
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,200
Well, I didn't know.

1150
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,680
No, you didn't know,
but you had a pretty fair idea.

1151
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,520
Why didn't you tell Loomis?

1152
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:50,000
Then you did a very neat fainting fit, which
probably allowed Cooper to get clear away.

1153
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:54,000
Don't talk like that.

1154
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:56,280
I can't bear it.

1155
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,960
I don't understand it.

1156
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:08,080
- How could you behave like that?
- But I can explain.

1157
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:10,480
I don't think that's necessary.

1158
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:14,560
In my job, I find a woman goes to almost
any length to protect her lover.

1159
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:16,280
But it's not like that.

1160
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:18,280
It's not like that at all.

1161
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,760
I thought I was in love with Jonathan...

1162
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:22,640
...but I'm not anymore.

1163
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:27,160
But it doesn't mean I won't go on
helping him, as I would any innocent man.

1164
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:31,120
It's not for you to decide whether he's
innocent or not. You leave that to the law.

1165
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,400
The point is, you put yourself
and your father...

1166
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:36,760
...in a very serious position
by this infernal amateur meddling.

1167
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,480
How I'm going to get you out of it,
I don't know.

1168
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,480
But you do want to get us out?

1169
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,800
In spite of the fact you made such
a fool of me, you mean.

1170
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:51,480
Your acting in the taxi
was extremely clever.

1171
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,440
I wasn't acting in the taxi.

1172
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:03,680
I fell in love with someone,
and all my plans went out the window.

1173
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,720
When we were in the taxi together, I felt
as though I were on a great golden cloud.

1174
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,920
I told Father I didn't want to go on
with this. I wanted to tell you everything.

1175
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:19,000
But he had an idea about
a bloodstained doll, and I had to put it off.

1176
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,200
I wanted to tell you all about it.

1177
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:24,720
Please believe me.

1178
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:30,480
Would you like to mix a cocktail
yourself, Mr. Smith?

1179
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:34,440
I'm afraid there's no ice,
but I'm sure you can manage.

1180
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,480
- Good evening, Smith.
- Good evening.

1181
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:41,680
- Do I hear the muted clanking of chains?
- It's only the plumbing.

1182
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,440
It's in a dreadful state.

1183
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,600
How did you enjoy the garden party,
Mr. Smith?

1184
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,880
It must have been awful in that rain.

1185
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:51,400
I think I'll take some sherry
up to Mr. Robinson.

1186
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:55,120
I've quite changed my mind about him.
He seems such a nice young man after all.

1187
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:58,520
Eve, dear, you will look after
Mr. Smith, won't you?

1188
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:04,120
Father, I've been explaining to Mr. Smith
what we're trying to do.

1189
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:06,280
He thinks we ought to stop.

1190
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,160
Oh, what a pity.

1191
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:11,760
Just when you and I were about to save
Mr. Smith so much trouble.

1192
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:14,560
Save me trouble?

1193
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:17,960
Sir, you don't look like an irresponsible
imbecile. Why behave like one?

1194
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:22,360
You let your daughter get mixed up in this?
What sort of father do you think you are?

1195
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,880
Unique. Quite unique.

1196
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:28,640
But rather broken-hearted at this moment.
You see, I have another idea.

1197
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:31,240
A pity to waste ideas, isn't it?

1198
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:35,880
Have you--? Have you ever
been blackmailed, Mr. Smith?

1199
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:38,360
Well, I have. Only this afternoon.

1200
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,920
At least my daughter and I were,
by Nellie Goode.

1201
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:44,120
Yes, most inappropriate name.
I told her so.

1202
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:47,920
She touched us for 24 pounds, and do you
know why I think it was well-spent?

1203
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,680
- Though we could ill afford it.
- Come to the point, please.

1204
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:55,800
Well, it struck me that what Nellie could do,
Doris could do.

1205
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:58,040
I mean suppose she went
to Miss lnwood and said:

1206
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:01,120
"Look, Miss lnwood,
I've got a certain dress of yours.

1207
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:04,520
It's ruined, but it's still worth money. "

1208
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:09,720
And suppose Miss lnwood said, "All right,
I'll give you 100 pounds for it."

1209
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,240
What then, eh?

1210
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:15,000
And suppose you happened
to be listening.

1211
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:18,560
Well, that's what police do
in blackmail cases, isn't it?

1212
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,800
What about it, eh? What about it?

1213
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:24,760
Oh, you needn't be afraid that Doris
couldn't do it. She could do it, Doris could.

1214
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:28,840
I mean, Eve could. She's a very good
actress, a very good actress indeed.

1215
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,600
I'm sure she is.

1216
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:36,080
By the way,
is there a bloodstained dress?

1217
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:40,120
Well, no. No, not exactly.

1218
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:43,760
Look, there was
a bloodstained dress, only....

1219
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,440
- Couldn't we tell you--?
- I'm getting back to the office.

1220
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:48,640
I'll let you know about this later.

1221
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:55,000
In the meantime, what's Miss lnwood
doing without a dresser?

1222
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:58,680
You better run along to the theater before
she starts getting impatient.

1223
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:02,920
It's all right.

1224
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,920
- What do you mean, " It's all right"?
- He's trying to save face.

1225
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:07,280
Not a bad face, either.

1226
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:10,480
He'll let us do it. What's the matter
with you? Aren't you pleased?

1227
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:13,800
Come on. We better hurry.

1228
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:17,880
Come to Burton Street and bring two men.
Post them at either end of the street.

1229
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:21,440
I'll be waiting at the telephone booth
at the corner. All right?

1230
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:43,400
Hello. Is that Mrs. Gill?
Is the commodore available?

1231
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:46,720
Oh, he's gone out. Is Miss Eve there?

1232
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:49,400
Oh, she's out too. No, one moment.

1233
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:52,360
May I speak to Mr. Robinson, please?

1234
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:12,800
- What's your idea, governor?
- Just a little experiment.

1235
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,320
- Plug it in.
- Okay.

1236
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,600
The mike's in position.

1237
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:35,120
I'm speaking about three foot from it.
Can you hear me?

1238
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:39,000
- T ell him the sound's all right.
- Okay.

1239
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:43,600
Do you think it'll work?

1240
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,200
What a day, darling.

1241
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:48,200
I've never in my whole life been so glad
to see the end of it.

1242
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,560
- Yes, madam.
- You must be tired too.

1243
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:53,240
It can't be easy to be a dresser
with no experience.

1244
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:56,640
But you're quite good.
Very good, indeed.

1245
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:00,120
Oh, that rain.
That rain at the garden party.

1246
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:03,680
Thank goodness it didn't rain at the funeral.
That would have been too much.

1247
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,000
I hate rainy funerals.

1248
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:08,760
And then somebody sent up
that disgusting doll.

1249
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:12,520
What vermin some vermin are.

1250
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:14,160
Yes, madam.

1251
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:16,880
By the way, did the police find you?

1252
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,840
I haven't seen them yet, madam.

1253
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,080
And anyway,
I've got nothing to tell them.

1254
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:22,840
Well, I suppose that's all.

1255
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,920
And that horrible Nellie
will be back tomorrow.

1256
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:30,360
We may never see each other again.
Ships that pass in the something or other.

1257
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:35,160
I like you. You're so very sweet and patient.
I don't suppose I'm easy to get on with.

1258
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:38,200
Oh, but you are, madam.
It's been wonderful working with you.

1259
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:40,480
And I do love the theater so.

1260
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:43,520
I don't see why. It's an awful life, really.

1261
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:45,760
Here, darling.
A little something extra for you.

1262
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:47,160
I couldn't, madam. Honestly.

1263
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:51,200
Don't be an idiot. Put it in the bank
or go out and get drunk or something.

1264
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,200
- Thank you, madam.
- Can I give you a lift?

1265
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:56,880
- lf you would drop me, I'd appreciate it.
- All right. Come along, then.

1266
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:07,680
- Good night.
- Good night.

1267
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,960
- Good night.
- Good night.

1268
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:22,520
- Miss lnwood, could I talk to you in private?
- We can talk in the car. That's private.

1269
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:24,720
No, that won't do.
I've got to talk to you now.

1270
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:26,480
What's all this about?

1271
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:29,040
Let's go someplace
where nobody can hear us.

1272
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,760
Good night.

1273
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,120
- Have you gone mad or something?
- No, madam.

1274
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:39,360
I want to tell you about
the bloodstained doll.

1275
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,760
Well, what about that doll?

1276
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:55,400
Oh, I hate all this, madam.
I'm that nervous.

1277
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:58,160
I'm so afraid of doing the wrong thing.

1278
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:02,080
You see, I have a dress that belongs to you
with a big bloodstain down the front.

1279
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:04,400
By rights, I know I should
go to the police...

1280
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,960
...but, to tell you the truth,
madam, I'm afraid.

1281
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:10,040
My dad would murder me
if I got my name in the papers.

1282
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:13,240
So, you see, I've come to you.
Maybe you could tell me what to do.

1283
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:14,800
How much do you want?

1284
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:18,200
Money never entered my head, madam.
I hope you won 't think that of me.

1285
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:23,240
Only if the dress were clean like new,
it might be worth, say, 75 or 100 pounds.

1286
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:26,240
I know nothing about
a bloodstained dress.

1287
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,960
This sounds to me remarkably
like blackmail.

1288
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:33,040
- I think I'd better call the police.
- Yes. Do call the police, Miss lnwood.

1289
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:35,960
We'll talk to them together.

1290
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:39,560
- You're not the maid.
- No, I'm not.

1291
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,960
Why have you been pretending
all this time?

1292
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:46,520
Shall we say we needed evidence?

1293
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:50,160
We? Are you from the police?

1294
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:53,040
How was the bloodstain
smeared on the dress?

1295
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:55,800
Who are you?

1296
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:59,360
Why were you so frightened when Jonathan
said he hadn't destroyed the dress?

1297
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:03,440
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You do know!

1298
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,040
Yes.

1299
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,120
Some blood did splash on my dress.

1300
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,200
I was there when Jonathan
killed my husband.

1301
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,920
- That's not true.
- lt is, but I had nothing to do with it.

1302
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:13,840
Jonathan wanted my name kept out of it.

1303
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,440
He sent me back to his rooms.

1304
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:18,200
He stayed behind to make it look
like robbery.

1305
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:20,880
- Then he brought me a clean dress.
- You're lying.

1306
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:23,480
It's a sacred truth. I swear to you it is.

1307
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:24,920
Listen, whoever you are...

1308
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:27,600
...I'll give you anything
if you keep me out of this.

1309
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:30,680
My jewelry is worth over 10,000 pounds.
You can have it all.

1310
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:33,520
And my furs or money.
How much do you want?

1311
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:35,400
I'll give you anything. Anything.

1312
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:38,560
I'm going now to break it up.
Bring them in. I want them together.

1313
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:41,080
You deliberately tried to pin
it all on Jonathan...

1314
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:44,600
- ... assisted by Mr. Freddie Williams.
- It's not true, I tell you. It's not!

1315
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:47,720
Well, you won 't get away with it.
I warn you, that's all.

1316
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:20,520
I ' ve had a terrible scene
with a lunatic girl.

1317
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:24,280
First she pretended to be my dresser,
then a detective and tried to blackmail me.

1318
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:28,280
That's all right, Miss lnwood. You stay here.
I'll have a word with you in a minute.

1319
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:32,040
Oh, good. They got him.

1320
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,480
Jonathan, what have they done to you?

1321
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:38,040
Why are you arresting him?

1322
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:40,760
Mellish, stand by Miss lnwood there!

1323
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,760
Heavens, that must be Cooper.

1324
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,280
Where's Miss lnwood?

1325
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:48,560
Cover the alleyway in case he used
an emergency door.

1326
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,600
- Where do those stairs lead to?
- Dressing rooms.

1327
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:53,040
Eve! Eve, come back!

1328
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:54,520
Where's the nearest telephone?

1329
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,600
- Eve.
- He came through an emergency door.

1330
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,600
Hurry up downstairs. Go on, hurry!

1331
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,560
Get back into the theater.

1332
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:03,640
Have you been told
to keep an eye on me?

1333
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:06,200
In a manner of speaking, yes.

1334
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:11,040
- ln that case, may I sit down?
- No harm in that.

1335
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:12,920
Get me a chair, then.

1336
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:15,160
Surely, ma'am. Surely.

1337
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:16,680
- Done with the mike?
- Yes.

1338
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:20,040
Okay. I wonder if they caught--

1339
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,280
What's the point of going up to the roof?

1340
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:31,680
He may have doubled back along the alley
and gone up the fire escape.

1341
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:34,920
- So they've heard everything I said?
- Yes.

1342
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:41,560
- And it's all in that book?
- All in there, in shorthand.

1343
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:43,640
How clever of you.

1344
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:47,440
Things look bad for me, don't they?

1345
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:51,800
I'm what you'd call an accessory...
I suppose.

1346
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,160
- George!
- Yes?

1347
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:56,240
Smith wants you down
at the stage doorkeeper's office.

1348
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:57,360
Thank you, darling.

1349
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:00,240
We'll need more men to cover
all the rooms in this place....

1350
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:03,120
It's not all in there.

1351
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:06,520
- What's your name?
- Mellish.

1352
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:12,080
- Do you like dogs, Mellish?
- Yes, ma'am, I do.

1353
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:15,560
But not all dogs.

1354
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:18,000
If they don't love you,
you don't love them.

1355
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:20,040
- That's right, isn't it?
- I suppose so.

1356
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:24,800
I had a dog once. He hated me.

1357
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:27,800
At last he bit me, and I had him shot.

1358
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:34,040
When I give all my love and get back
treachery and hatred, it's....

1359
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,800
It's as if my mother
had struck me in the face.

1360
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:43,160
Do you understand that, Mellish?

1361
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:45,400
I've heard it takes them
that way sometimes.

1362
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:50,800
Yes. It takes some of them that way.

1363
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:53,240
- Has Miss lnwood gone yet?
- No, she's in the theater.

1364
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:56,880
- Don't you think he's well away now?
- I'm sure I saw him run down the alley.

1365
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:58,480
This is Smith.

1366
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:01,400
We're covering the theater
from the roof to the storeroom.

1367
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:03,480
- Fine, sir.
- You heard what Miss lnwood said.

1368
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,560
You can't have anything
against Cooper now.

1369
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:09,040
Nothing, except murder. He killed
Charlotte's husband, all right.

1370
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,760
He's killed before.

1371
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,840
What? What do you mean?

1372
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,480
He got away with it last time with a plea
of self-defense. He won't this time.

1373
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:18,240
- But Eve.
- She's alone with him now.

1374
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,040
Can't you see, sir?
She's in very great danger.

1375
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:40,160
It all adds up to a confession,
except she said you killed him.

1376
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:42,960
Anyone in their right mind
could see she was telling a lie.

1377
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:46,080
But I don't understand why Smith
arrested you. What happened?

1378
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:48,680
Somebody phoned and said
the police were on their way.

1379
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:52,320
I made a bolt for it, and they
grabbed me at the street door.

1380
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,600
Funny, that.
Getting me out into the street.

1381
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:59,280
I suppose Smith didn't want me
to be caught in your house.

1382
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,800
That would have been awkward for you,
wouldn't it?

1383
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:04,080
I don't think they'll look
for us here for a bit.

1384
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:07,200
After a while, maybe we can make
a dash through an emergency exit.

1385
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:12,920
Eve. Eve. Eve, wherever you are,
come away from him.

1386
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:16,400
Come away from him.
He's dangerous. He's a killer.

1387
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:19,080
Eve? Eve?

1388
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:25,720
You're right, you know.
Charlotte was telling the truth.

1389
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:32,160
What she didn't tell you was that
she goaded me into doing it.

1390
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,720
She set me against him
in every way she could.

1391
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:37,960
She made me think she was crazy
about me, but she wasn't.

1392
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:42,760
I was to kill her husband to leave
the coast clear for that Freddie Williams.

1393
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:47,000
I know that now.
She knew the sort of man I was.

1394
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:50,400
She knows I can't control myself
if I get into a rage.

1395
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:53,280
Like a fool, I told her
about that girl I'd killed.

1396
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:56,520
Oh, Jonathan. Jonathan,
you don't know what you're saying.

1397
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:01,160
I can't help it, Eve. I can't control
myself, even when I was a kid.

1398
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:06,000
I was lucky that last time. The little
fool threatened me with a gun.

1399
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:09,560
But you don't know what it's like
to have a thing like this hanging over you.

1400
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:16,080
Eve, I hated to tell you that
phony story in your car that time...

1401
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,360
...but there was no other way.

1402
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:23,400
Charlotte did go on to my flat
after I'd killed her husband.

1403
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:28,360
Her dress was stained a bit,
so I brought her a clean one.

1404
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:30,560
Then when she went to the theater...

1405
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:33,360
...I made a big stain on it
to make you believe me.

1406
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:37,640
I'm telling you the truth now.

1407
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:42,920
Jonathan...

1408
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:46,760
...I feel desperately sorry for you.

1409
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,840
Really, I do.

1410
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:54,000
No, you don't. You're not sorry at all.

1411
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,720
You don't care what happens to me.

1412
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:01,800
Jonathan...

1413
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:06,720
...you could give yourself up.
They'd take care of you.

1414
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,840
You couldn't do all these things
unless you....

1415
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:12,240
Unless....

1416
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:19,440
They can't do anything to a sick man,
and that's what you are. You must be.

1417
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:24,600
No. They're going to hang me.
They'll hang Charlotte, too, for planning it.

1418
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:28,960
They've never forgiven me for getting
away with it the first time.

1419
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:34,280
There's nothing wrong with my mind.
Nobody can prove that there is, unless....

1420
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:47,040
Unless I do it a third time...

1421
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:50,280
...with no reason whatever.

1422
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:54,520
That would be a clear case of insanity.

1423
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:56,600
Wouldn't it?

1424
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:01,640
Wouldn't it?

1425
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:17,720
Jonathan. Jonathan,
I don't hear a sound now.

1426
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:21,360
I think we can go now.

1427
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:25,360
We'll go out through the orchestra pit,
and then I'll take you to my father's boat.

1428
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:29,520
Come along.

1429
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,000
Here he is!

1430
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:03,200
Look! In the orchestra pit!

1431
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:09,720
Mathews, quick! Down in the orchestra!

1432
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:18,600
- They've got him!
- Where?

1433
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:20,600
- They found him.
- Where was he?

1434
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:23,160
- He was in the theater after all.
- Call Smith!

1435
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:26,800
- He was at the stage doorkeeper's office.
- Drop the iron curtain, cut him off!

1436
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,040
Get out! Move your head
out of the way!

1437
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:42,360
- Take the curtain up.
- Don't touch anything.

1438
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:45,360
Mellish, you'd better phone
up the photographer.

1439
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:49,720
Someone find out if Byard's here yet.
Tell him what's happened.
