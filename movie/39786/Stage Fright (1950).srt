1
00:01:09,785 --> 00:01:11,810
- Any sign of the police?
- No, no sign.

2
00:01:11,987 --> 00:01:14,080
- Looks like we're getting away with it.
- Good.

3
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:17,089
- How far is it to your father's boat?
- Two hours with luck.

4
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:19,955
Your luck seems to be very good,
touching wood.

5
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:22,927
Could you tell me now what happened?
I'd really like to know.

6
00:01:23,098 --> 00:01:24,429
Only if you feel like it.

7
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,761
It's Charlotte Inwood.

8
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,538
- She's in a jam.
- That doesn't surprise me.

9
00:01:29,705 --> 00:01:31,570
No, this is serious, Eve.
Deadly serious.

10
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,766
She was all over the place.
I had to help her. Anybody would have.

11
00:01:34,944 --> 00:01:37,276
I was in my kitchen. It was about 5:00.

12
00:01:37,446 --> 00:01:41,382
The doorbell rang, and I went downstairs
to see who it was.

13
00:01:49,224 --> 00:01:52,887
Jonnie, you love me. Say that you
love me. You do love me, don't you?

14
00:01:53,062 --> 00:01:56,031
I think he's dead. I'm sure he's dead.

15
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:58,291
I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it.

16
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:01,027
- Who's dead?
- My husband.

17
00:02:01,203 --> 00:02:04,297
We had a terrible quarrel about you.

18
00:02:04,473 --> 00:02:07,840
Oh, he was vile.
You know the sort of things he can say.

19
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,810
He started to hit me.
I grabbed something.

20
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:15,473
I was out of my mind with fear.
Oh, what am I to do?

21
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:18,711
Darling, pull yourself together.
He may not be.

22
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:22,991
The curtains, Jonnie. Draw the curtains.

23
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:48,346
I thought I had some brandy.

24
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:50,644
Here, drink this.

25
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:58,719
He was an abominable man.

26
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:00,861
Why do women marry abominable men?

27
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,793
- Where was all this?
- In my bedroom.

28
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:05,934
- Anyone else in the house?
- I left the servants in the country.

29
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:09,298
I drove up early to have an hour's rest
before the performance.

30
00:03:09,471 --> 00:03:13,202
Oh, what shall I do?
I can't go on. I can't.

31
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,809
- Has anyone seen you?
- No. I don't think so.

32
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:19,675
There wasn't a soul in the street.
I jumped into my car and came here.

33
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:21,509
It's parked around the corner.

34
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:24,016
Oh, Jonnie, what will they do to me?

35
00:03:24,186 --> 00:03:27,383
Don't tremble like that. We'll find a way.
We'll see you're all right.

36
00:03:27,556 --> 00:03:30,320
But you must call the theater.
I can't play tonight.

37
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,722
Tell them I'm ill.
Heavens, it'll be true enough.

38
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:35,227
No, you must go on tonight.
You've got to.

39
00:03:35,397 --> 00:03:38,025
As if nothing had happened.
Nothing has happened.

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,760
You drove straight to the theater,
do you understand?

41
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:44,497
You haven't been home at all.
Now, get that into your head.

42
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:52,469
But my dress. There's blood on it.

43
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:55,617
- I must go back and change.
- No, you can't do that.

44
00:03:56,752 --> 00:03:58,947
Or I could go myself.

45
00:03:59,354 --> 00:04:03,051
Oh, darling, could you?
There's no one there.

46
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:04,749
I'd give you the key.

47
00:04:04,927 --> 00:04:07,327
There's a blue dress like this
in the big cupboard...

48
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:10,021
...next to my window in the bedroom.
Here's the key.

49
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,192
- Are you sure the servants aren't back?
- No, but you must hurry. Oh, please, Jonnie.

50
00:04:14,369 --> 00:04:15,597
This is my only chance.

51
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:17,864
- You will, won't you?
- It's a risk.

52
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,564
Let me think a minute. I mean...

53
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:22,267
Well, you know I want to help you, but...

54
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,141
Go or don't go. It's all the same.

55
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:30,442
I thought you loved me.

56
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,523
- Doesn't matter now.
- Oh, my dear. My darling.

57
00:04:41,263 --> 00:04:44,494
I'd do anything for you. You know that.

58
00:04:47,703 --> 00:04:49,500
I'll be as quick as I can.

59
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,952
It was your maid, Nellie.

60
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,422
Oh, yes.

61
00:07:59,594 --> 00:08:03,462
She was going to the house to pick up
some shoes I need for the show.

62
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,393
- Did she recognize you?
- I don't know.

63
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:11,562
You ought to get to the theater. The police
are bound to go there to tell you the news.

64
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,332
Give me my belt, darling, will you?

65
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:21,147
Oh, Jonnie, what have I done to you?

66
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:24,217
If Nellie recognized you,
it won't be safe here.

67
00:08:24,386 --> 00:08:27,082
- You ought to go away.
- I don't think that'll do much good.

68
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:29,985
But they'll come here.
You must go at once.

69
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:32,524
Oh, my dearest darling,
you have saved me.

70
00:08:32,694 --> 00:08:36,357
We must think of you now.
You've got to hide.

71
00:08:40,135 --> 00:08:42,433
What do I care what happens to me?

72
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:44,629
Your job is to try to forget everything.

73
00:08:44,806 --> 00:08:47,639
Let me do the worrying. I'll find a way.

74
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,546
Then we'll start again,
won't we, you and I?

75
00:08:51,713 --> 00:08:55,410
No more stealth and cheating and lying.

76
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:58,881
I must hurry, darling.
But I worry about you.

77
00:08:59,054 --> 00:09:02,512
Well, you mustn't. You're an actress.
You're playing a part.

78
00:09:02,691 --> 00:09:05,819
- No nerves when you're on.
- I'll try.

79
00:09:09,197 --> 00:09:10,824
My dress!

80
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,066
- I'll get rid of that. Don't worry.
- Don't come down.

81
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:16,170
We shouldn't be seen together.

82
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:19,171
- <i>Au revoir</i>, my darling.
- <i>Au revoir</i>.

83
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:21,802
And for heaven's sake, don't worry.

84
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:48,759
- Yes?
- May I speak to Miss Eve Gill, please?

85
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:52,032
Oh, dear, no. I'm afraid she isn't in.

86
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,293
She was going for the weekend
to her father...

87
00:10:54,469 --> 00:10:58,701
...but I thought she'd be back.
- Yes, that's right. She got back last night.

88
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:03,174
She's had rehearsals all day today
at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

89
00:11:03,345 --> 00:11:05,540
You know, the RADA.

90
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:07,682
Do you know when she...?
Where she is now?

91
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:09,746
Didn't you hear?

92
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:13,410
She's at the RADA rehearsing.

93
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:26,985
- Jonathan Cooper?
- Yes.

94
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:29,790
We're police officers.
May we see you for a few minutes?

95
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:32,365
Most certainly. Please come in.

96
00:13:20,782 --> 00:13:23,182
- Tell you that I can't possibly
accede to your request.

97
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:27,784
I've come to this decision after giving
the matter my earnest consideration.

98
00:13:27,956 --> 00:13:30,686
Stop me if ever there was
such an ungrateful child!

99
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:33,487
No, darling. Don't run your words
into one another.

100
00:13:50,512 --> 00:13:52,275
- The child most shamefully.

101
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:55,245
Is it not in your memory
that we, too, years ago...

102
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,215
...suffered the follies and fevers of youth?

103
00:13:58,386 --> 00:14:01,583
If our blood runs cooler
and more temperate, let us not account...

104
00:14:01,756 --> 00:14:05,817
...to ourselves for virtue, but place it
to the credit of the soothing balm...

105
00:14:05,994 --> 00:14:08,895
...of the passage of years
that we have fortifications...

106
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:11,532
...against the distempers of juvenility.

107
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:15,264
You were wont to be kinder than this.

108
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:18,201
No, Papa, you are cruel.
If all parents were of your mind...

109
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:22,332
...marriage would be an impossibility. Then
what would become of the human race?

110
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,640
- Go away. What are you doing here?
- The police are after me. Do you see them?

111
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,942
You have not, I hope,
forgotten the tragedy...

112
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:31,984
They think I killed a man.
Can you hide me on your father's boat?

113
00:14:32,153 --> 00:14:34,087
Are you so heartless as to wish...?

114
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:35,483
They've just gone.

115
00:14:36,324 --> 00:14:39,782
I was under the impression that this
was a class of intelligent students...

116
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:42,759
...trying to master an extremely
difficult and beautiful art.

117
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:45,799
I haven't the pleasure of knowing you,
young man...

118
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:48,401
...but I shall report your behavior
to Sir Kenneth.

119
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,266
Now we will begin the rehearsal again,
with the other cast.

120
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:56,206
- This cast think acting is fun and games.
- I'm terribly sorry, Miss Ashton.

121
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:59,245
- Oh, Jonathan.
- Let's go. Have you got your car here?

122
00:14:59,414 --> 00:15:03,612
It's parked in front. I'll show you
to the back entrance and pick you up there.

123
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:06,946
Eve, do you hate me...

124
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:09,488
...now that you know
about Charlotte and me?

125
00:15:10,558 --> 00:15:13,459
Why, I could never hate you, Jonathan...

126
00:15:13,628 --> 00:15:18,292
...because we're...
We're such old friends.

127
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:20,366
And...

128
00:15:20,535 --> 00:15:22,765
Well, just because.

129
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:27,764
But I do wish I'd taken lessons
on the second fiddle.

130
00:15:28,076 --> 00:15:29,771
Good old Eve.

131
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:06,674
Bring him in here.

132
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:08,906
It's warmer.

133
00:16:10,585 --> 00:16:13,179
Do you think I behaved like a fool?

134
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:16,257
On the whole, I think so.

135
00:16:16,424 --> 00:16:19,325
I think your boyfriend
has behaved like a fool.

136
00:16:19,494 --> 00:16:22,463
I have a strong premonition
that I'm going to behave like a fool.

137
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,599
- It's infectious.
- Do you mean you're going to help him?

138
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:27,291
Why not?

139
00:16:27,469 --> 00:16:29,869
He's a friend of yours, isn't he?

140
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:32,768
- Oh, yes.
- I see.

141
00:16:32,941 --> 00:16:34,670
More than a friend, eh?

142
00:16:34,843 --> 00:16:38,108
When I'm with him, I get a feeling
in here that... That's sort of...

143
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,270
Yes. Well, we'll go
into the symptoms later.

144
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:44,578
Meanwhile, I take it you're either
keen on him or still hungry.

145
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,911
I'm in love with him.

146
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:55,324
You've roped him, but he's not yet
broken to harness. Is that it?

147
00:16:57,198 --> 00:16:59,894
I wish Charlotte Inwood was in...

148
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:01,828
Oh, do you?

149
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:03,595
I've seen her on the stage.

150
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:07,298
She'd have made me laugh,
if I hadn't been strictly on my guard.

151
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:09,943
Well, she couldn't make me laugh,
off or on the stage.

152
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:12,875
I can't bear to sit by and see
what she's doing to Jonathan.

153
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:15,242
She's like an evil spirit.
Just look at him!

154
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,748
Ruined, and by a woman.

155
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,812
Now you want me to take the ruins
for a little cruise.

156
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:25,823
- Well, is that it?
- I thought you could take him...

157
00:17:25,994 --> 00:17:29,395
...across the channel or to the Irish coast.
Then he could hide out a bit.

158
00:17:29,564 --> 00:17:31,589
The journey sounds attractive,
but less so...

159
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:35,293
...to help a suspected murderer to escape,
particularly with my reputation.

160
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,335
There's nothing wrong
with your reputation.

161
00:17:37,505 --> 00:17:40,167
Oh, indeed.
I rather flattered myself that there was.

162
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:43,208
As a matter of fact, the customs people
have their eye on me.

163
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:45,437
I'm suspected of being a smuggler.

164
00:17:45,613 --> 00:17:47,638
- Well, you're not.
- Oh, yes, I am.

165
00:17:47,815 --> 00:17:50,409
One cask of brandy?
That doesn't mean you're a smuggler.

166
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:54,377
- Two casks.
- That was 15 years ago.

167
00:17:54,556 --> 00:17:58,424
I've done one or two other things since
that I didn't tell you or your mother about.

168
00:17:58,593 --> 00:18:02,586
- Can't have been very much.
- Of course not. Not very much.

169
00:18:02,764 --> 00:18:06,461
Nothing could appear very much
to a murderer's moll.

170
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:08,668
But I never hope to be appreciated.

171
00:18:08,836 --> 00:18:10,861
Yes, your mother cured me of that.

172
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,530
That's why I never could be bothered
with your mother.

173
00:18:14,242 --> 00:18:18,474
I appreciate you, Father. You and
Captain Kidd are my favorite heroes.

174
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:22,313
My child, I am not deceived.

175
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:26,681
If there's one thing I cannot bear,
it's insincerity.

176
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:29,888
But you've got to help him.
You will help him, won't you?

177
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:34,017
He's lonely. He hasn't got any friends
but me, and maybe you.

178
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:37,323
- You will help him, won't you?
- He hasn't got me...

179
00:18:37,498 --> 00:18:38,829
...yet.

180
00:18:40,935 --> 00:18:44,632
You're just dying to get into a part of this,
and you know you are.

181
00:18:44,806 --> 00:18:47,366
A part in this melodramatic play,
you mean?

182
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:49,339
That's the way you're treating it, Eve.

183
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,308
As though it were a play
you were acting in at the Academy.

184
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,348
Everything seems a fine acting role
when you're stage-struck...

185
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:58,280
...doesn't it, my dear?

186
00:18:58,453 --> 00:19:01,911
Here you have a plot,
an interesting cast...

187
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,049
...even a costume,
little the worse for wear.

188
00:19:06,227 --> 00:19:09,788
Unfortunately, Eve,
in this real and earnest life...

189
00:19:09,964 --> 00:19:13,456
...we must face the situation
and all its bearings.

190
00:19:13,668 --> 00:19:15,397
Yes.

191
00:19:16,137 --> 00:19:17,365
What do you mean?

192
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:21,804
Well, Miss Charlotte Inwood
appears to be an expert in garden paths.

193
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:25,002
I think she's led your young friend
up the garden path.

194
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:27,545
I think we should hesitate
before we follow him.

195
00:19:27,715 --> 00:19:29,808
- But why?
- I don't know how this bloodstain...

196
00:19:29,984 --> 00:19:34,045
...got onto this dress, but I do know that
somebody smeared it on deliberately.

197
00:19:34,222 --> 00:19:35,712
But why should they do that?

198
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:39,348
Well, Miss Inwood is an actress,
a very good one.

199
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:41,825
She has an eye
for an emotional situation.

200
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:45,227
Supposing she wanted our somnolent
young friend to go to her house...

201
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,833
...and be spotted there.

202
00:19:47,001 --> 00:19:50,960
Well, this sanguinary garment
would provide a very plausible reason.

203
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:53,630
A very plausible reason indeed.

204
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:57,266
So that's why she didn't change her dress
before she went to his rooms.

205
00:19:57,445 --> 00:20:00,505
Well, I cannot imagine Miss Inwood
going to see her young man...

206
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:04,174
Or your young man, whose ever young man
he is, in this nasty, messy condition.

207
00:20:04,352 --> 00:20:08,083
No. This dress is a clue, my dear,
a very important clue.

208
00:20:08,256 --> 00:20:11,282
And though it grieves me, of all people,
to have to say it, Eve...

209
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:13,893
...I think we should go to the police.

210
00:20:16,464 --> 00:20:18,955
Jonathan! Jonathan, wake up.

211
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:21,727
Jonathan, how far do you think
you could trust Charlotte?

212
00:20:21,903 --> 00:20:24,201
I'd trust her with my life.
What do you mean?

213
00:20:24,372 --> 00:20:26,806
This bloodstain was put here deliberately.

214
00:20:26,974 --> 00:20:30,705
Don't be ridiculous. You're trying to turn me
against Charlotte, but you can't.

215
00:20:30,878 --> 00:20:34,314
What's this doing here, anyhow?
It should have been destroyed hours ago!

216
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:37,007
Fool! There goes the evidence
that could've helped you.

217
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:40,313
I'm doing all this for Charlotte's sake.
You're just jealous of her!

218
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:42,888
Young man, I'd remind you
you're my daughter's guest.

219
00:20:43,057 --> 00:20:44,581
I'd like better manners from you.

220
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:46,624
Oh, I am sorry, Eve.

221
00:20:46,794 --> 00:20:48,625
Please forgive me.

222
00:20:49,797 --> 00:20:51,094
I lost my head for a moment.

223
00:20:51,265 --> 00:20:54,723
I can hardly think.
I'm almost dead for want of sleep.

224
00:20:54,936 --> 00:20:57,905
I wonder, would it be too much trouble
if I went to bed?

225
00:20:58,072 --> 00:21:01,132
That is, if Commodore Gill
wants to let me stay.

226
00:21:03,644 --> 00:21:06,772
Your room is at the head of the stairs.
You'll be quite comfortable.

227
00:21:06,948 --> 00:21:08,916
And if you want anything to read in bed...

228
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,881
...you'll find some quite good
murder mysteries in there.

229
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:13,782
Beg your pardon.

230
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:21,058
Look, Eve...

231
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:22,958
But he's just gone...

232
00:21:46,854 --> 00:21:50,950
At last we are alone and unobserved.
You know, I'm beginning to enjoy this.

233
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,185
Father, do you think she arranged
to put the suspicion on Jonathan?

234
00:21:54,362 --> 00:21:57,854
- Do you think she deliberately framed him?
- The thought had crossed my mind.

235
00:21:58,032 --> 00:22:02,025
That was why I reluctantly suggested that
our friends, the police, ought to be told.

236
00:22:02,203 --> 00:22:05,036
But it's too late. Our only evidence
has gone up the chimney.

237
00:22:05,206 --> 00:22:07,538
But we must help him.
He'll do nothing for himself.

238
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:11,109
He's hopelessly in love with that woman.
It's up to us.

239
00:22:11,846 --> 00:22:14,940
Yes, but it won't be easy.

240
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:18,483
It is easy.
I'll go to her and see her myself.

241
00:22:18,653 --> 00:22:21,178
- Would that be wise?
- But I don't care if it is or not.

242
00:22:21,355 --> 00:22:25,849
I'll tell her we know how the bloodstain got
on the dress and every move of her game.

243
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:29,024
I'll make her talk.
It'll be one woman to another.

244
00:22:29,197 --> 00:22:31,188
An impressive situation at any time.

245
00:22:31,365 --> 00:22:34,129
She won't be able to help
but give herself away. You'll see.

246
00:22:34,302 --> 00:22:37,430
I won't see. I won't be there,
and neither will you.

247
00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:40,199
If we're right in what we think,
she's a dangerous woman.

248
00:22:40,374 --> 00:22:42,968
She won't give herself away.
You'd be giving her an alternative.

249
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:45,442
She has no alternative.

250
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,947
She might murder you.

251
00:22:50,017 --> 00:22:52,247
Oh, don't be so melodramatic, Father.

252
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,184
Look, my love. Face facts.

253
00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:00,022
What is the least that can happen to you
if you tackle this remarkable lady?

254
00:23:00,194 --> 00:23:03,789
She'll at once pick up a little pink
telephone and call the police.

255
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,958
She will then give you in charge
for concealing a fugitive from justice.

256
00:23:08,135 --> 00:23:10,626
Eventually, you will be tried
at the Old Bailey.

257
00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:14,798
Well, if you're lucky, you might get off
with, now, let me see...

258
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:18,468
...a couple of years, which you will spend
in Holloway prison...

259
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:22,480
...meditating on the folly of transmuting
melodrama into real life.

260
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:24,907
Well...

261
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,453
The best thing you can do, my girl,
is to go back to your Academy...

262
00:23:29,624 --> 00:23:31,615
...and practice your soul-shaking antics...

263
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:34,488
...in surroundings where
they can't do any harm.

264
00:23:34,662 --> 00:23:38,428
After all, this fellow can't possibly
mean all that to you.

265
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:41,701
But he does, Father.

266
00:25:24,505 --> 00:25:26,097
- Move along, please.
- But I'd like...

267
00:25:26,273 --> 00:25:28,741
Now move along, ma'am.
This is nothing to see.

268
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:38,247
Hello, Father?
I'm outside the Inwood house.

269
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:40,444
Outside? Why not inside?

270
00:25:40,621 --> 00:25:43,954
Don't be ridiculous, Father.
The police won't let anyone near the place.

271
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,526
Really? How very extraordinary.

272
00:25:47,695 --> 00:25:49,788
Look, you've done your best.
Come back here...

273
00:25:49,964 --> 00:25:52,558
...and decide about the man
that came to dinner.

274
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:56,797
Oh, I feel awful. I've been listening
to the people in the crowd talking...

275
00:25:56,971 --> 00:26:00,168
...and they assume that
you-know-who is guilty...

276
00:26:00,341 --> 00:26:03,572
...and all the police have to do
is catch him. It's terrifying.

277
00:26:03,744 --> 00:26:05,837
Yes, but the police may not
think he's guilty.

278
00:26:06,013 --> 00:26:07,981
After all, they work in secret, you know.

279
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:11,209
They may have their own ideas
about a certain lady.

280
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:14,010
I wish I knew what
the police were thinking.

281
00:26:15,122 --> 00:26:19,456
- Well, look, why not ask them?
- Well, that's easier said than done.

282
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:21,589
Oh, just a minute, Father.

283
00:26:24,131 --> 00:26:26,861
- Father, goodbye now.
- Eve...

284
00:26:33,741 --> 00:26:36,574
I'll see you back at the office
about 2:00, sir.

285
00:27:24,725 --> 00:27:27,694
May I have a small brandy, please?

286
00:27:28,195 --> 00:27:32,097
Madam. Pardon my intrusion,
but is there, by any chance...

287
00:27:32,266 --> 00:27:36,259
...any assistance I could be of?
- No, thank you.

288
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:47,539
- I don't know how you pick up all the dirt.
- Oh, I get around.

289
00:27:47,715 --> 00:27:50,582
Any case, I know Munson's...

290
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:56,685
Right from the horse's mouth.

291
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:04,729
I most solemnly assure you, madam...

292
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:08,494
...it would be a pleasure, if there was
any assistance I could be of.

293
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:09,966
Thank you very much.

294
00:28:10,938 --> 00:28:14,704
If you will allow me to say so,
you look depressed.

295
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:18,436
Yes, the cheering word,
the helping hand...

296
00:28:18,612 --> 00:28:20,807
I'm perfectly all right.

297
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:25,147
Oh, good. Right. Good, good.

298
00:28:36,497 --> 00:28:38,931
Is there anything I can do?

299
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:42,796
Look, I don't know your trouble,
but you don't look very well to me.

300
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:46,736
A little brandy can't do you any harm.
Why not drink it?

301
00:28:55,482 --> 00:28:59,248
My great-aunt died over a glass of brandy,
but it was her 15th that day.

302
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,888
- Feeling any better?
- Yes, thank you.

303
00:29:02,056 --> 00:29:03,489
You left your lunch over there.

304
00:29:03,657 --> 00:29:06,057
It won't feel lonely.
I'll go back to it in a minute.

305
00:29:06,227 --> 00:29:08,024
Perhaps you're allergic to bars.
Look...

306
00:29:08,195 --> 00:29:10,720
...would you feel less uneasy
if I sat with you, or more so?

307
00:29:10,898 --> 00:29:14,095
- Perhaps you're allergic to strange men too.
- No. I love strange men.

308
00:29:14,268 --> 00:29:18,671
- I mean, I'm very fond of them.
- I'll just go and get my lunch.

309
00:29:21,175 --> 00:29:25,271
The butler told me. Never saw such a sight.
They say his head was bashed in.

310
00:29:25,446 --> 00:29:28,677
I heard they clocked him so hard his
false teeth went across the room.

311
00:29:28,849 --> 00:29:32,250
I know I'm pretty silly, but I overheard
two people on the street today...

312
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:34,410
...talking about the murder.

313
00:29:34,588 --> 00:29:37,056
They went into a lot of detail.

314
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:40,859
I felt so sick and giddy,
I just had to come in and have a brandy.

315
00:29:41,028 --> 00:29:43,690
My father says I tend
to overdramatize everything.

316
00:29:43,864 --> 00:29:47,356
I expect he's right. I know how you feel,
though. I hate violence myself.

317
00:29:47,534 --> 00:29:50,367
Doesn't that make it
rather difficult for you?

318
00:29:50,537 --> 00:29:55,270
I mean, I think we ought to face up
to the ugly side of life.

319
00:29:55,442 --> 00:29:58,639
Now, me, for instance.
I'm an actress.

320
00:29:58,812 --> 00:30:02,077
I ought to face up to all sorts
of experiences, oughtn't I?

321
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:06,151
Oh, I don't know. Supposing I happened
to be a librarian.

322
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,723
A librarian doesn't encounter much violence
except an occasional encyclopedia falling.

323
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:13,155
But you're not a librarian, are you?

324
00:30:13,327 --> 00:30:15,352
No, I'm not. How do you know?

325
00:30:16,196 --> 00:30:18,858
Well, you just don't
look like a librarian.

326
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:23,396
- You don't look like an actress.
- Oh? I thought I did.

327
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:30,373
Well, I'm only a beginner, really.
That is, I've only played one part in public.

328
00:30:31,245 --> 00:30:33,236
- Could I have seen you?
- I don't think so.

329
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:37,350
It was in the church hall.
I played the fourth deadly sin.

330
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:42,051
- Were you good?
- I was pretty deadly.

331
00:30:42,222 --> 00:30:43,883
What was this Jonathan Cooper after?

332
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:48,188
- I heard there was nothing stolen.
- Perhaps he did it for the fun of it...

333
00:30:48,362 --> 00:30:49,590
Poor Charlotte Inwood.

334
00:30:49,763 --> 00:30:52,561
Imagine coming home and finding
your husband horribly dead...

335
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:55,634
...policemen and detectives
all over the house, and the blood...

336
00:30:55,803 --> 00:30:57,031
Careful, careful.

337
00:30:57,204 --> 00:31:01,573
Remember, you're sensitive to that sort
of thing. You'll bring on another fainting fit.

338
00:31:01,842 --> 00:31:05,334
I hear that Charlotte Inwood's going back
into the show in a couple of days.

339
00:31:05,512 --> 00:31:07,377
Must be dreadful to sing and dance...

340
00:31:07,548 --> 00:31:10,210
...with that horrible picture
still burning in one's mind.

341
00:31:10,384 --> 00:31:14,946
Oh, it's the old story, "Is not the actor
the man with a heart?" all over again.

342
00:31:15,122 --> 00:31:17,488
I once had a cousin
who had a duodenal ulcer...

343
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:20,126
...and an extremely funny face,
both at the same time.

344
00:31:20,294 --> 00:31:22,626
Everybody laughed
when he was telling his symptoms.

345
00:31:22,796 --> 00:31:24,161
His name was Jim.

346
00:31:24,331 --> 00:31:26,128
That must have been terrible.

347
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,962
Oh, I don't know.
Jim's quite a common name.

348
00:31:31,071 --> 00:31:33,904
I wonder what Charlotte Inwood
is really like. Really, I mean.

349
00:31:34,074 --> 00:31:36,599
- Oh, hello, Nellie.
- That's Charlotte Inwood's maid.

350
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,785
Hello, Nellie. I didn't expect
to see you so soon.

351
00:31:45,953 --> 00:31:47,978
How are you bearing up after last night?

352
00:31:48,155 --> 00:31:50,817
Mrs. Tippet, what I've been through.
All those policemen.

353
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:52,925
Bothering you with a lot of questions.

354
00:31:53,093 --> 00:31:56,494
Questions? They've been asking me this,
asking me that, all morning long.

355
00:31:56,663 --> 00:31:58,654
I didn't know whether
I was coming or going.

356
00:31:58,832 --> 00:32:00,424
Gin and lemon, please, Mrs. Tippet.

357
00:32:00,601 --> 00:32:02,193
- Not too much lemon, dear.
- Okay.

358
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:07,272
Mind you, they never laid a finger on me,
but, oh, the questions. Nag, nag, nag.

359
00:32:07,441 --> 00:32:10,899
"How did you know it was Mr. Cooper?
How many times you seen him and where?

360
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:14,138
And did he give you anything?"
Blimey, he never gave me nothing.

361
00:32:14,314 --> 00:32:16,214
"And how long you been
Miss Inwood's maid?"

362
00:32:16,383 --> 00:32:18,544
They was gentlemanly and polite,
all right...

363
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:21,119
...but give me the bleeding Russians
any day, dear.

364
00:32:21,288 --> 00:32:24,257
Yes. You gotta watch your step
when you're up against the police.

365
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:26,893
If that wasn't enough,
when I came out of the house...

366
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,552
...the reporters pounced on me with their
questions, asking me the lowdown.

367
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:33,928
I just jumped out of my skin when that
photographer's flashbulb went.

368
00:32:34,101 --> 00:32:36,729
Well, I mean, fancy taking my picture.

369
00:32:36,904 --> 00:32:41,364
You're quite a celebrity, you lucky girl.
I'll have to buy the <i>Daily Mirror</i> tomorrow.

370
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:45,535
Of course, I'm not saying a word
to the reporters. Not a word.

371
00:32:45,712 --> 00:32:49,204
After all, who discovered the body?

372
00:32:49,383 --> 00:32:53,149
I'll be a star witness at that trial, and my
story ought to be worth something...

373
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,584
...and I've no intention of giving it away.

374
00:32:55,756 --> 00:33:01,388
- Isn't she talking too much?
- Too much, too loud, too everything.

375
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,462
How do you feel now?

376
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:07,066
Oh, I feel a little better, thank you.

377
00:33:07,234 --> 00:33:08,701
I have to go.

378
00:33:08,869 --> 00:33:10,530
I don't like leaving you here alone.

379
00:33:10,704 --> 00:33:12,797
Do you feel fit enough
to let me see you home?

380
00:33:12,973 --> 00:33:15,999
- I have a car.
- Perhaps you'd better let me drive it for you.

381
00:33:16,176 --> 00:33:19,668
Well, that's very kind of you.
I do still feel a bit wobbly.

382
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:23,749
To be quite honest, it isn't kindness at all.
I mean, I'm afraid I maneuvered it.

383
00:33:24,084 --> 00:33:26,211
How clever of you.

384
00:33:26,386 --> 00:33:29,719
You've got something there, Fred.
I'll drink to that, on you.

385
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:32,256
A double gin and lemon, please.

386
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,227
Double? All right, Nellie,
I hope it chokes you.

387
00:33:36,396 --> 00:33:39,832
You don't miss a trick, do you?
You're always on the make.

388
00:33:51,345 --> 00:33:54,974
My mother's really a dear. My father, too,
but they shout at one another...

389
00:33:55,148 --> 00:33:56,911
...and neither one like to shout.

390
00:33:57,084 --> 00:33:59,143
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this.

391
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:02,720
You've been extraordinarily kind and
you know nothing whatsoever about me.

392
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,953
Oh, I don't know, Miss Gill.

393
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:08,060
You were born in South Africa.
The 17th of September, wasn't it?

394
00:34:08,228 --> 00:34:11,789
Educated in America and you're studying
at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

395
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:13,626
Your parents don't live together.

396
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,736
You're a very well-behaved lady, but allergic
to murder, and that drove you to drink.

397
00:34:17,905 --> 00:34:19,133
I hope it's only temporary.

398
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,569
But I don't even know your name.

399
00:34:21,742 --> 00:34:23,471
I only know that you play the piano.

400
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:27,444
I'm so sorry. It was stupid of me.
I forgot. My name is Smith.

401
00:34:28,048 --> 00:34:30,243
Just ordinary Smith?

402
00:34:39,927 --> 00:34:41,758
A detective?

403
00:34:42,095 --> 00:34:43,995
I hope you don't mind.

404
00:34:44,298 --> 00:34:46,823
Oh, no. Of course not.

405
00:34:47,134 --> 00:34:48,761
Well, I'm delighted.

406
00:34:48,936 --> 00:34:52,667
By the way, I don't suppose you and
your mother are interested in tea...

407
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:54,170
...with a detective, that is.

408
00:34:54,775 --> 00:34:57,642
Of course. Especially with a detective.

409
00:34:57,811 --> 00:35:01,679
- Would you like to have tea with us?
- Oh, I'd love to. How about this afternoon?

410
00:35:01,848 --> 00:35:04,510
- Well, tomorrow, then?
- Yes.

411
00:35:04,785 --> 00:35:07,151
Yes. That's fine.

412
00:35:30,043 --> 00:35:32,603
And I could take your place.

413
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:36,144
You'd never get away with it. What
makes you think you could be a maid?

414
00:35:36,316 --> 00:35:37,908
It would only be for a day or two.

415
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:40,383
You'd have to be her dresser
down at the theater.

416
00:35:40,554 --> 00:35:43,455
You couldn't do that.
That's very highly skilled work.

417
00:35:43,624 --> 00:35:46,286
- Well, I could if you told me how.
- It sounds phony to me.

418
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,224
All this trouble just to get
a newspaper story.

419
00:35:49,396 --> 00:35:52,524
Well, we women reporters have
a tough job competing with the men...

420
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:54,826
...especially on
important stories like this.

421
00:35:55,002 --> 00:35:57,266
And what paper are you on, may I ask?

422
00:35:57,437 --> 00:35:59,667
Well, I can't tell you that.

423
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,139
If anything should go wrong,
it would be embarrassing for the paper.

424
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,073
Oh? And what about my job?

425
00:36:05,245 --> 00:36:08,373
Suppose Miss Inwood found out
I was passing you off as my cousin.

426
00:36:08,548 --> 00:36:10,311
I'm not sure she won't smell a rat.

427
00:36:10,484 --> 00:36:12,179
I never been away ill for years.

428
00:36:12,352 --> 00:36:15,685
But anyone could go sick.
And I could do it, really I could.

429
00:36:15,856 --> 00:36:18,552
I've... I've done a bit of acting.

430
00:36:18,725 --> 00:36:20,659
Character acting?

431
00:36:21,161 --> 00:36:22,856
- Yes.
- I see.

432
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:27,023
All you gotta do is put on some old clothes
and make yourself look common like me.

433
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,692
Let me explain why it's so important
that I get the right slant on this.

434
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:34,432
I think there's a romance between
Miss Inwood and this man named Cooper.

435
00:36:34,608 --> 00:36:37,600
And where did you get this idea?
Do you know what I think?

436
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,144
- I think you're snooping for the police.
- Oh, no...

437
00:36:40,313 --> 00:36:43,476
I saw you this morning sitting
on this very seat with a detective.

438
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:47,115
Oh, well, that was Wilfred Smith.

439
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:50,654
He's an old friend of mine.
I didn't get a thing out of him.

440
00:36:50,824 --> 00:36:52,849
Charlie, double gin and lemon, please.

441
00:36:53,026 --> 00:36:56,189
- Not too much lemon, dear.
- Same for me.

442
00:36:57,998 --> 00:37:01,798
I can get five times that much
from any newspaper when the case is over.

443
00:37:02,202 --> 00:37:03,897
Why not get both?

444
00:37:04,204 --> 00:37:05,432
Caught you, have I?

445
00:37:05,605 --> 00:37:09,166
Hope I don't intrude
on some deep conspiracy.

446
00:37:09,342 --> 00:37:14,279
And I hope you find yourself no worse
for your distressing experiences.

447
00:37:14,614 --> 00:37:18,948
Haven't I met your charming
friend before? I know that face.

448
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,514
This is my cousin Doris, Mr. Fortesque.

449
00:37:22,689 --> 00:37:25,123
Oh, yeah. Charming. Charming.

450
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:29,285
Perhaps as dear Nellie didn't
provide me with your surname...

451
00:37:29,463 --> 00:37:31,931
...you'll let me call you Doris, eh?

452
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:10,585
Mrs. Mason, I can't think what I've done
with my reading glasses.

453
00:39:10,763 --> 00:39:13,664
Have you seen them anywhere?

454
00:39:37,923 --> 00:39:39,447
- Could l...?
- Oh, there you are.

455
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:43,994
Help me find my glasses, Eve, darling.
I can't see a thing.

456
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,298
I'm Doris Tinsdale.

457
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,904
I'm from Nellie.

458
00:40:05,517 --> 00:40:06,916
Move along there, please.

459
00:40:12,191 --> 00:40:13,715
I'm Doris Tinsdale.

460
00:40:13,893 --> 00:40:15,622
- Miss Inwood's expecting me.
- Oh, yes.

461
00:40:15,794 --> 00:40:18,695
You're the temporary Nellie sent along.

462
00:40:27,172 --> 00:40:29,640
Just wait over here a minute.

463
00:40:36,649 --> 00:40:39,846
We'd like to see Miss Inwood.
Can I have a few words with you as well?

464
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:42,283
By all means.
Will you step this way, please?

465
00:40:42,454 --> 00:40:45,389
I understand you've been in service
now for six or seven years.

466
00:40:45,557 --> 00:40:49,550
Six years and nine months,
to be precise...

467
00:40:49,728 --> 00:40:51,457
Come in.

468
00:40:52,765 --> 00:40:56,997
Okay, yes. I'll come around
the box office tonight.

469
00:40:57,603 --> 00:41:00,572
- What did they say, Freddie?
- More cancellations.

470
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:02,297
Oh, how stupid people are.

471
00:41:02,474 --> 00:41:05,204
Even if my understudy's legs
are so peculiar...

472
00:41:05,377 --> 00:41:07,470
...she's just as good as I am.

473
00:41:07,646 --> 00:41:10,843
She knows darn well she'd better not be.
That's not the point.

474
00:41:11,016 --> 00:41:13,416
It's you they want to see.

475
00:41:13,953 --> 00:41:17,116
- Well, what do you want?
- I'm from Nellie.

476
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:18,586
Madam's expecting me.

477
00:41:19,124 --> 00:41:21,558
The new girl's here, Charlie.

478
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:34,168
No, no. This doesn't fit me.

479
00:41:36,008 --> 00:41:39,739
Here, here. Pull it up on this side.
The other side too.

480
00:41:39,912 --> 00:41:42,107
You know that, don't you?

481
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:45,146
Excuse me, madam.

482
00:41:45,317 --> 00:41:47,649
Read it to me, dear.

483
00:41:52,891 --> 00:41:55,689
"Dear Madam, this will introduce
my cousin Doris...

484
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:57,522
...who is in every way a good girl."

485
00:41:57,696 --> 00:41:59,891
Not so loud.

486
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:03,965
"I hope you'll find her satisfactory
during my illness. Signed, Nellie Goode."

487
00:42:04,136 --> 00:42:07,162
This is very nice,
if you can call mourning nice...

488
00:42:07,339 --> 00:42:13,869
...but isn't there some way we could let it
plunge a little in front? I suppose not.

489
00:42:14,279 --> 00:42:15,576
"Signed, Nellie Goode."

490
00:42:15,748 --> 00:42:20,048
If we could only work in a little
color somewhere. Oh, well.

491
00:42:20,419 --> 00:42:22,614
"Signed, Nellie Goode."

492
00:42:23,022 --> 00:42:24,649
Take off your hat, dear.

493
00:42:24,823 --> 00:42:27,451
There are simply millions
of things to do, I'm afraid.

494
00:42:27,726 --> 00:42:29,990
You won't mind if I depend
on you a great deal?

495
00:42:30,429 --> 00:42:31,953
Thank you, darling.

496
00:42:32,197 --> 00:42:35,689
Now, get me out of these weeds.
I'm beginning to feel sad, and I shouldn't.

497
00:42:35,868 --> 00:42:38,200
It's so depressing.

498
00:42:38,637 --> 00:42:40,502
See who that is.

499
00:42:41,106 --> 00:42:42,596
What's your name?

500
00:42:42,775 --> 00:42:45,539
Doris Tinsdale, madam.

501
00:42:53,886 --> 00:42:55,285
Yes? What is it, Groves?

502
00:42:55,454 --> 00:42:57,388
Divisional Detective Inspector Byard...

503
00:42:57,556 --> 00:42:59,922
...and Detective Inspector Smith
to see you, madam.

504
00:43:00,092 --> 00:43:01,582
Good heavens.

505
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,024
Hear that, Freddie? The police again.

506
00:43:04,196 --> 00:43:06,790
- Show them up, Groves.
- Very good, madam.

507
00:43:06,965 --> 00:43:10,059
I thought I told you to wait downstairs.

508
00:43:10,736 --> 00:43:14,900
Hand me a negligee from that cupboard
over there, will you, Phyllis?

509
00:43:15,441 --> 00:43:19,878
Now, what about this dress for
the theatrical garden party, Miss Inwood?

510
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,480
Black? Oh, yes, of course.

511
00:43:23,649 --> 00:43:25,810
How clever of you to remember, darling.

512
00:43:25,984 --> 00:43:28,179
Hold that for me, will you?

513
00:43:30,222 --> 00:43:32,190
- Freddie.
- Yes?

514
00:43:32,357 --> 00:43:35,417
We haven't decided. Am I going
to the theatrical garden party?

515
00:43:35,594 --> 00:43:37,391
I don't feel an atom like it.

516
00:43:37,563 --> 00:43:40,293
I keep thinking about those
dreadful cancellations.

517
00:43:40,466 --> 00:43:42,491
I don't see why.
They're a compliment to you.

518
00:43:42,668 --> 00:43:45,398
Hand me a comb and mirror
from over there, will you?

519
00:43:45,571 --> 00:43:47,937
But they do cut down the takings.

520
00:43:48,107 --> 00:43:51,804
I think I could appear tonight,
if you insisted.

521
00:43:51,977 --> 00:43:53,877
Wouldn't it be a terrible strain for you?

522
00:43:54,046 --> 00:43:56,412
Oh, ghastly.

523
00:43:56,582 --> 00:44:01,212
But I can't help feel
for my poor, dear, loyal public.

524
00:44:01,386 --> 00:44:03,616
Looking towards it for weeks...

525
00:44:03,789 --> 00:44:07,225
...and then trailing back sadly
with their tickets...

526
00:44:07,392 --> 00:44:10,828
...getting their money returned.
I simply can't bear it.

527
00:44:10,996 --> 00:44:12,861
It would be pretty trying.

528
00:44:13,031 --> 00:44:15,090
Waves of sympathy coming on the stage...

529
00:44:15,267 --> 00:44:17,565
...all the gangways flooded with tears.

530
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:20,900
I can hardly bear the thought myself.

531
00:44:21,073 --> 00:44:24,372
No use trying to stop me.
I'm going on tonight.

532
00:44:24,543 --> 00:44:26,534
Be at the theater at 6:00 sharp, will you?

533
00:44:26,712 --> 00:44:29,579
- Yes, madam.
- Take this away.

534
00:44:30,782 --> 00:44:33,910
You go right ahead, dear.
Garden party dress and everything.

535
00:44:34,086 --> 00:44:39,183
And why don't we let ourselves
go a trifle just in front, huh?

536
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:41,952
And thank you so very much.

537
00:44:45,531 --> 00:44:48,466
What do you suppose
the police wants now?

538
00:44:48,634 --> 00:44:49,862
I don't know.

539
00:44:50,035 --> 00:44:51,935
Must you speak to me
with your mouth full?

540
00:44:52,104 --> 00:44:55,232
They've probably come to look under
your bed for Master Cooper.

541
00:44:55,807 --> 00:44:59,265
What could I tell them about Cooper?
I know nothing about him.

542
00:44:59,444 --> 00:45:01,105
Tell them just that.

543
00:45:01,513 --> 00:45:03,071
Listen.

544
00:45:05,751 --> 00:45:07,742
That's a good idea.

545
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,417
Elsie, darling, come here.

546
00:45:11,657 --> 00:45:14,285
Now, I want you to wait
in the other room and listen.

547
00:45:14,459 --> 00:45:17,690
When you hear me cough, you come
in and say, "The doctor's here."

548
00:45:17,863 --> 00:45:19,091
Yes, madam.

549
00:45:19,264 --> 00:45:21,164
You can stand just so much of detectives.

550
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:23,733
After all, they are only policemen
with smaller feet.

551
00:45:30,642 --> 00:45:32,974
- In here?
- The next door, sir.

552
00:45:34,012 --> 00:45:35,877
What's the matter with Nellie?

553
00:45:36,048 --> 00:45:39,609
Oh, it's her stomach, sir,
if you'll excuse the expression.

554
00:45:39,785 --> 00:45:42,151
The tragedy and excitement
was too much for her.

555
00:45:42,321 --> 00:45:44,789
- Highly strung type, eh?
- Oh, very, sir.

556
00:45:45,157 --> 00:45:48,354
I suppose you know, Miss Inwood,
that whatever Cooper's motive was...

557
00:45:48,527 --> 00:45:50,620
...it certainly couldn't have been robbery.

558
00:45:50,796 --> 00:45:53,321
Of course, darling. I understand that.

559
00:45:53,699 --> 00:45:56,532
I suppose he just tried
to make it look like robbery.

560
00:45:56,702 --> 00:45:58,761
What's your name again?

561
00:45:59,404 --> 00:46:02,567
- Doris, sir.
- You know, Doris, you're not bad-looking.

562
00:46:02,741 --> 00:46:05,869
- Thank you, sir.
- You don't treat your face properly.

563
00:46:06,044 --> 00:46:09,207
If you fixed your hair and used makeup,
you'd be quite attractive.

564
00:46:09,381 --> 00:46:12,248
I suppose I shouldn't have seen him
as often as I did.

565
00:46:12,417 --> 00:46:15,978
But I didn't realize how madly
infatuated he was with me.

566
00:46:16,588 --> 00:46:18,453
I just didn't realize.

567
00:46:18,724 --> 00:46:22,660
You'll never know how much
I blame myself for all this.

568
00:46:22,894 --> 00:46:25,294
When my husband came back
from New York last week...

569
00:46:25,464 --> 00:46:27,432
...and I told Jonnie I couldn't see him...

570
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,123
...he kept on phoning me.

571
00:46:29,301 --> 00:46:31,132
He wouldn't let me alone.

572
00:46:31,303 --> 00:46:33,635
Oh, maybe if I had agreed to see him...

573
00:46:33,805 --> 00:46:35,898
...he wouldn't have done
this dreadful thing.

574
00:46:36,074 --> 00:46:40,238
- When did you last see Jonathan Cooper?
- Let me think.

575
00:46:40,412 --> 00:46:42,846
It must have been a week...

576
00:46:43,015 --> 00:46:45,006
A week before my husband died.

577
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,647
- Go on. What are you waiting for?
- Did he come to this house?

578
00:46:53,558 --> 00:46:56,891
Excuse me, madam.
The doctor's waiting to see you.

579
00:46:57,062 --> 00:46:59,997
Oh, I'm so sorry, darling,
but I will have to see my doctor.

580
00:47:00,165 --> 00:47:03,999
I'm feeling wretched.
I've been trying to get him all morning.

581
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:06,399
You see, I'm going on tonight.

582
00:47:06,571 --> 00:47:08,698
The producer has insisted so much.

583
00:47:08,874 --> 00:47:11,104
And I don't want to see him
ruined because of me.

584
00:47:11,276 --> 00:47:13,972
That's all right. I think
we've covered most of the points.

585
00:47:14,146 --> 00:47:17,138
If there's any more I can help you with,
you will let me know?

586
00:47:17,316 --> 00:47:20,012
Thank you. We'll try not
to trouble you again.

587
00:47:20,185 --> 00:47:21,413
Thank you.

588
00:47:21,586 --> 00:47:23,816
You're so understanding.

589
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:26,521
And so are you.

590
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:28,919
Doris, show the gentlemen out.

591
00:47:29,094 --> 00:47:32,552
It's all right, thank you. We can
find our own way downstairs.

592
00:47:34,299 --> 00:47:36,199
Freddie.

593
00:47:37,469 --> 00:47:39,801
Mavis, go to the kitchen
and get yourself some tea.

594
00:47:39,971 --> 00:47:43,065
- I'll ring when I need you.
- Yes. Thank you, madam.

595
00:48:28,754 --> 00:48:31,314
- Darling, where is Jonathan?
- Friends may be hiding him.

596
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:32,752
He had no friends, only me.

597
00:48:32,924 --> 00:48:36,087
I hope he hasn't made any and hasn't
taken them into his confidence.

598
00:48:36,261 --> 00:48:38,126
For your sake, his sake and their sake.

599
00:48:38,296 --> 00:48:41,288
- What do you mean?
- Lf the truth comes out, it would break you.

600
00:48:41,466 --> 00:48:43,400
- I can't have that.
- What could you do?

601
00:48:43,568 --> 00:48:46,731
You know me.
You know how it is with me.

602
00:48:49,574 --> 00:48:53,567
- You make me afraid.
- Not I. You don't know what fear is.

603
00:48:57,416 --> 00:48:58,974
Oh, that would be most lovely.

604
00:48:59,151 --> 00:49:01,016
Of course,
you must be fond of swimming.

605
00:49:01,186 --> 00:49:03,154
But I am, yes I am,
very fond of it.

606
00:49:03,321 --> 00:49:05,255
I go out to the country
to find somewhere to swim.

607
00:49:05,424 --> 00:49:07,392
You don't live in the country? Oh, dear.

608
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:11,962
Of course, we miss the rain so much, don't
we? All the flowers. It's so disappointing.

609
00:49:13,131 --> 00:49:15,895
I really must apologize for Eve, Mr...?

610
00:49:16,067 --> 00:49:18,433
- Was the name Smith?
- Smith, yes.

611
00:49:18,603 --> 00:49:21,436
Smith.
The name seems familiar, somehow.

612
00:49:21,606 --> 00:49:24,598
I can't understand
why that girl is so late.

613
00:49:24,776 --> 00:49:26,971
I mean, she's usually so punctual.

614
00:49:27,145 --> 00:49:29,443
She takes that from me.
Her father isn't punctual.

615
00:49:29,614 --> 00:49:32,583
He catches trains and things,
but always at the last moment.

616
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:34,446
I'm there at least an hour before.

617
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:37,645
Yes. I'm sure you are.
I have heard a lot about you, Mrs. Gill.

618
00:49:37,823 --> 00:49:40,986
Oh, have you? Is Eve very fond of me?

619
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:45,994
Have you known her long, Mr. Smith?
I've got the name right now, haven't I?

620
00:49:46,164 --> 00:49:48,462
I've known her
for about a day and a half.

621
00:49:49,234 --> 00:49:51,600
That's not very long.

622
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:53,032
Where did you meet?

623
00:49:53,205 --> 00:49:56,504
As a matter of fact,
we met in the saloon bar of a pub.

624
00:49:56,675 --> 00:49:58,165
Well.

625
00:49:58,343 --> 00:50:00,311
How interesting.

626
00:50:00,579 --> 00:50:01,807
Thank you.

627
00:50:03,715 --> 00:50:05,876
- Am I intruding?
- This is Mr. Smith.

628
00:50:06,051 --> 00:50:09,043
Mr. Smith, this is Eve's father.
We see him now and again.

629
00:50:09,221 --> 00:50:12,156
- How do you do, sir?
- Very well, indeed. Thank you.

630
00:50:12,324 --> 00:50:14,292
- Do sit down.
- Thank you.

631
00:50:15,727 --> 00:50:18,059
- Where's Eve?
- She should be here by this time.

632
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:19,527
She asked Mr. Smith to tea.

633
00:50:19,698 --> 00:50:21,427
Oh, good, good.
Anyone else coming?

634
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,034
I mean, going to be a party?
I am fond of parties.

635
00:50:24,202 --> 00:50:26,762
No. There's no one else coming,
and you weren't invited.

636
00:50:26,938 --> 00:50:29,065
Wasn't I? Oh, an oversight.

637
00:50:29,241 --> 00:50:30,606
But I forgive you.

638
00:50:30,775 --> 00:50:33,505
Forgiveness, Mr. Smith.
The secret of a happy married life.

639
00:50:33,678 --> 00:50:37,239
That and good long stretches of the
absence that makes the heart grow fonder.

640
00:50:37,415 --> 00:50:41,010
There you are, my dear.
The last but four of the Mahicans.

641
00:50:44,923 --> 00:50:48,290
- Will you forgive me, Mr. Ordinary Smith?
- Yes. I've just been set an example.

642
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,758
Yes, but he says his name
is just plain Smith.

643
00:50:50,929 --> 00:50:52,794
He did? I'm terribly sorry to be late...

644
00:50:52,964 --> 00:50:56,229
...but the rehearsal went on and
the awful part is, I have to go back.

645
00:50:56,401 --> 00:50:59,234
- It was decent of you to have come.
- What are you doing here?

646
00:50:59,404 --> 00:51:02,202
- I've been trying to reach you all day.
- I took the boat out.

647
00:51:02,374 --> 00:51:04,239
We had quite a little cruise.

648
00:51:04,409 --> 00:51:06,468
Jonnie and me.

649
00:51:07,412 --> 00:51:10,779
Poor old Jonnie.
I hope his rheumatism is better.

650
00:51:13,585 --> 00:51:17,146
Do play something, Mr. Smith.
Mr. Smith is a pianist, Mother.

651
00:51:17,322 --> 00:51:19,290
Well, I think that's a delightful career.

652
00:51:19,524 --> 00:51:23,392
- I often wish I'd kept up my practicing.
- It's not exactly my career, Mrs. Gill.

653
00:51:23,562 --> 00:51:25,530
But you must play for us.
Make him, Mother.

654
00:51:25,697 --> 00:51:27,460
But I haven't even started my tea yet.

655
00:51:27,632 --> 00:51:29,964
But of course he hasn't.
Eve, you are ridiculous.

656
00:51:30,268 --> 00:51:33,169
But I've got to leave in a minute.
Please play.

657
00:51:33,605 --> 00:51:36,802
You know, Jonnie's not
much of a sailor, Eve.

658
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:38,937
He was abominably seasick.

659
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:43,206
In fact, as soon as we got ashore,
Jonnie ran away.

660
00:51:43,381 --> 00:51:45,872
- Who's Jonnie?
- I wish I knew.

661
00:51:46,051 --> 00:51:48,713
He's about 57 different varieties.

662
00:51:48,887 --> 00:51:52,721
Roughly speaking, he was a dog of some
sort that strayed in a couple of nights ago.

663
00:51:52,891 --> 00:51:56,418
- Do the police know about him?
- No, no. I'm not worried about him.

664
00:51:56,595 --> 00:51:59,155
I daresay he'll find his way
back to his old master.

665
00:51:59,331 --> 00:52:00,764
Or mistress.

666
00:52:00,932 --> 00:52:03,594
I thought we might have to ask
for your help, Mr. Smith.

667
00:52:03,768 --> 00:52:06,362
Mr. Smith is a detective, Mother.

668
00:52:06,538 --> 00:52:08,130
Mrs. Mason.

669
00:52:11,176 --> 00:52:13,576
A detective. How very unusual.

670
00:52:13,745 --> 00:52:15,838
I suppose you have
many fascinating cases.

671
00:52:16,014 --> 00:52:19,142
- Must be very exciting.
- Not very, I'm afraid.

672
00:52:19,317 --> 00:52:22,753
- Embezzlement, fraud, petty thefts.
- Smuggling?

673
00:52:22,921 --> 00:52:24,684
Yes. Occasionally. Brandy mostly.

674
00:52:25,123 --> 00:52:26,988
Murder, too, sometimes, Father.

675
00:52:27,158 --> 00:52:29,786
Mr. Smith is working on the Inwood case.

676
00:52:31,196 --> 00:52:35,599
Oh, you don't say so.
Yes, I read about that somewhere.

677
00:52:36,067 --> 00:52:37,932
How did you know?

678
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:41,204
I saw your photograph in the paper.

679
00:52:41,506 --> 00:52:43,974
What is the fellow's name, Clippen.

680
00:52:44,142 --> 00:52:46,110
Cooper, Cooper.
Did he do it, do you think?

681
00:52:46,277 --> 00:52:48,074
He has run away and remained in hiding.

682
00:52:48,246 --> 00:52:51,443
We're inclined to accept the obvious
as being obvious.

683
00:53:06,031 --> 00:53:09,728
Oh, it's just like Sherlock Holmes
and his fiddle.

684
00:53:09,901 --> 00:53:15,134
A stream of beautiful sound,
and then suddenly out pops the solution.

685
00:53:26,718 --> 00:53:28,515
- Oh, I must run.
- So must I.

686
00:53:28,687 --> 00:53:31,781
- I don't know what you'll think of me.
- I like people bound up in their work.

687
00:53:31,956 --> 00:53:34,789
- You'll make a very good actress indeed.
- <i>Au revoir,</i> my pet.

688
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,858
Meet me at the stage door...

689
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:44,728
- Can't I drive you back to the Academy?
- No. I want you to get to know Father.

690
00:53:44,903 --> 00:53:47,371
Not professionally,
but he's a wonderful character.

691
00:53:47,539 --> 00:53:50,440
- They'd be hurt if you didn't stay.
- When will I see you again?

692
00:53:50,608 --> 00:53:54,772
- Well, I really don't...
- Ring me tomorrow first thing. Regent 1113.

693
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:32,743
I know you think I'm an idiot,
but I'm not. I'm doing darn well.

694
00:54:32,917 --> 00:54:35,385
Yes. You're giving a very good show.
A very good show.

695
00:54:35,553 --> 00:54:38,886
- Pity you've no audience.
- But you're my audience.

696
00:54:39,057 --> 00:54:41,719
I wish you'd give me a little
applause now and then.

697
00:54:41,893 --> 00:54:44,885
- I wonder when Jonathan will turn up.
- Turn up where?

698
00:54:45,063 --> 00:54:47,293
Wherever Miss Charlotte Inwood
happens to be.

699
00:54:47,465 --> 00:54:49,365
Good heavens, she'll only turn him over.

700
00:54:49,534 --> 00:54:53,129
Yes, and to your nice new friend,
Mr. Smith.

701
00:55:07,852 --> 00:55:09,615
Who was that man?

702
00:55:09,788 --> 00:55:11,983
Oh, that was my dad, madam.

703
00:55:12,157 --> 00:55:14,887
I told him about my temporary job,
and he doesn't like it.

704
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:17,289
What with the murder and all.
You know, madam.

705
00:55:17,462 --> 00:55:19,930
What's it got to do with him?
Or with you?

706
00:55:20,098 --> 00:55:23,431
My dad says that man on the run
might turn up here.

707
00:55:23,601 --> 00:55:25,762
Might even get into the dressing room.

708
00:55:25,937 --> 00:55:27,802
Might even murder me, madam.

709
00:55:27,972 --> 00:55:31,271
It's the scene of the crime the murderer
returns to, not the theater.

710
00:55:31,442 --> 00:55:33,171
He might be right, my dad.

711
00:55:33,344 --> 00:55:35,778
I'm surprised you're not
a bit afraid yourself.

712
00:55:36,281 --> 00:55:37,839
Slippers.

713
00:55:38,016 --> 00:55:40,507
This theater's the last place
he'd want to be seen in.

714
00:55:40,685 --> 00:55:43,017
Now, stop acting like a silly schoolgirl.

715
00:55:43,188 --> 00:55:46,646
The only murderer here
is the orchestra leader.

716
00:56:05,009 --> 00:56:08,376
Father, you've got to keep on the lookout
and head Jonathan off.

717
00:56:08,546 --> 00:56:10,571
Right. Certainly, my dear.

718
00:56:10,748 --> 00:56:13,148
This is desperate.

719
00:56:14,586 --> 00:56:17,555
Go on, go on, go on.

720
00:59:41,659 --> 00:59:42,887
Madam, madam.

721
00:59:43,061 --> 00:59:44,653
- What?
- Madam, there's a man.

722
00:59:45,663 --> 00:59:49,224
- He's gone up to your dressing room.
- What are you talking about? What man?

723
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,834
I saw him. Don't go up there.
It's dangerous.

724
00:59:52,003 --> 00:59:53,834
You're an imbecile.

725
00:59:54,005 --> 00:59:55,973
You needn't come up.

726
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:59,041
I'll manage to change myself.

727
01:00:20,998 --> 01:00:24,957
I know, Jonnie, darling,
but what a terrible risk you've taken.

728
01:00:25,136 --> 01:00:28,128
- I couldn't keep away.
- You haven't told me where you've been.

729
01:00:28,306 --> 01:00:30,604
Some friends looked after me.

730
01:00:30,775 --> 01:00:32,640
- What friends?
- Never mind that just now.

731
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:34,710
We've got to work out
a plan of campaign.

732
01:00:34,879 --> 01:00:37,848
- Everything is going on beautifully.
- We've got to get a story...

733
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:41,542
...and we'll both have to stick to it.
- I must change.

734
01:00:43,254 --> 01:00:46,746
You shouldn't have come here, Jonnie.
You have been so wonderful up to now.

735
01:00:46,924 --> 01:00:49,586
Don't think that I'm ungrateful.
I'm not. Truly, I'm not.

736
01:00:50,228 --> 01:00:53,891
- I don't know how I shall ever repay you.
- Repay me?

737
01:00:54,866 --> 01:00:56,663
You talk as though this were a favor.

738
01:00:57,268 --> 01:00:59,930
Something that a "thank you"
can take care of.

739
01:01:00,104 --> 01:01:04,063
Dearest, you mustn't be foolish.
You must go away at once. Back to...

740
01:01:04,242 --> 01:01:05,903
...where you were hiding.

741
01:01:06,077 --> 01:01:08,602
Freddie's going to get you
out of the country soon.

742
01:01:08,779 --> 01:01:11,543
And I'll come to see you,
when the run of the show's over.

743
01:01:11,716 --> 01:01:15,243
Why, that may be months,
maybe a year, or more.

744
01:01:15,419 --> 01:01:18,877
Well, you know how it is. We were
playing to capacity before this happened.

745
01:01:19,056 --> 01:01:21,024
Now they're hanging on to the chandeliers.

746
01:01:21,192 --> 01:01:22,784
Fifty pounds up tonight.

747
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,190
Goodness knows how they squeeze them in.

748
01:01:25,363 --> 01:01:29,322
Yes. I could only get standing room.

749
01:01:29,767 --> 01:01:32,031
Well, there you are.

750
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:35,897
We'll find a lovely place,
South America or somewhere.

751
01:01:36,841 --> 01:01:40,743
And I'll come out to you, as soon
as all of this has blown over.

752
01:01:41,212 --> 01:01:44,841
I'll be glad of the rest for a week or two.

753
01:01:45,516 --> 01:01:47,211
Palm trees...

754
01:01:47,385 --> 01:01:49,012
...sunshine.

755
01:01:49,187 --> 01:01:50,484
Lovely.

756
01:01:51,189 --> 01:01:53,020
A week or two?

757
01:01:53,191 --> 01:01:56,388
Well, you don't want me to give up
everything, do you?

758
01:01:57,428 --> 01:02:00,158
Why not? I have.

759
01:02:01,265 --> 01:02:05,463
Now, Jonnie, I thought you said that
my happiness was all that mattered...

760
01:02:05,636 --> 01:02:09,094
...and you must admit that
you behaved as if it was.

761
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,068
Taking all the trouble
to protect my reputation...

762
01:02:12,243 --> 01:02:13,835
...covering up the accident...

763
01:02:14,011 --> 01:02:17,208
...destroying that dreadful dress
with the bloodstain on it.

764
01:02:17,381 --> 01:02:18,973
I didn't destroy it.

765
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:23,450
You didn't?

766
01:02:25,756 --> 01:02:28,088
Jonnie, you promised.

767
01:02:28,259 --> 01:02:30,420
Don't you realize if they find the dress...

768
01:02:33,197 --> 01:02:37,429
So long as I have that dress, I'm the one
who decides how long this show will run.

769
01:02:37,768 --> 01:02:39,030
And everything else.

770
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:41,132
Do you understand?

771
01:02:42,273 --> 01:02:45,333
Where the devil is Miss Inwood?
The orchestra's started her number.

772
01:02:45,509 --> 01:02:47,943
My socks and suspenders, where is she?

773
01:02:48,112 --> 01:02:50,410
Take this. I'll change downstairs.

774
01:02:50,581 --> 01:02:52,640
Sorry, darling. A hook broke.

775
01:02:57,288 --> 01:03:00,121
Just a minute, Charlie.
Jonathan Cooper's in the theater.

776
01:03:00,291 --> 01:03:03,055
The sergeant's seen him.
He was sure to make for your room.

777
01:03:03,227 --> 01:03:06,856
- Have you seen him?
- Of course not. What a stupid idea.

778
01:03:07,031 --> 01:03:09,363
I think I better take a look
at your dressing room.

779
01:03:09,533 --> 01:03:12,559
Doris, show Sergeant Loomis where to go.

780
01:03:12,737 --> 01:03:15,672
- Freddie, there's something...
- Miss Inwood, please.

781
01:03:17,441 --> 01:03:20,604
Doris, what are you waiting for?

782
01:03:32,523 --> 01:03:34,923
Oh, Mr. Loomis, I feel so queer.
It's my heart.

783
01:03:35,092 --> 01:03:37,617
The doctor told me I should
take the stairs easy.

784
01:03:37,795 --> 01:03:40,320
You don't think he'll try to shoot
his way out, do you?

785
01:03:40,498 --> 01:03:43,058
He might be desperate, sergeant.

786
01:03:43,701 --> 01:03:46,864
Don't you think you ought
to go back and get a policeman?

787
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:27,771
She was glad he got away, Father.

788
01:04:27,945 --> 01:04:30,470
- How do you know?
- By a look she gave Freddie Williams.

789
01:04:31,682 --> 01:04:33,445
"Look she gave"? That won't get you far.

790
01:04:33,617 --> 01:04:36,518
She'd be more delighted if she knew
there was no stained dress.

791
01:04:36,687 --> 01:04:37,915
Oh, yes.

792
01:04:38,089 --> 01:04:41,149
- I wish we still had that dress.
- There's so very little time.

793
01:04:41,325 --> 01:04:43,953
We've got to make every minute count.

794
01:04:44,128 --> 01:04:45,720
I have to phone Smith tomorrow.

795
01:04:45,896 --> 01:04:48,729
Why don't I invite him to the theatrical
garden party with me?

796
01:04:48,899 --> 01:04:51,197
I have to sell programs there.

797
01:04:51,902 --> 01:04:55,201
- I don't quite follow you, my dear Holmes.
- In order to make him see.

798
01:04:55,373 --> 01:04:58,900
Nobody suspects our Charlotte yet,
and they've got to.

799
01:04:59,243 --> 01:05:02,371
First, you'd see my mother and father
and get approved by them.

800
01:05:02,546 --> 01:05:05,447
Most parents nowadays don't seem
to care what sort of people...

801
01:05:05,616 --> 01:05:09,108
...their children go around with,
but I'm not like that.

802
01:05:09,286 --> 01:05:12,813
I know I'm very old-fashioned,
but I've got to think of Eve.

803
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:15,322
What do you do for a living?

804
01:05:16,293 --> 01:05:17,783
I write a bit.

805
01:05:17,962 --> 01:05:19,930
What, novels and things?

806
01:05:20,097 --> 01:05:23,658
I'm very fond of novels. You know,
I read a delightful one the other day.

807
01:05:23,834 --> 01:05:26,632
Let me see. What was the title?
It was written by that woman.

808
01:05:26,804 --> 01:05:29,272
I can't remember, but she's written
a number of books.

809
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,876
You must have read some of them.
They're all about charming people.

810
01:05:33,043 --> 01:05:35,170
She only writes
about the nice side of life.

811
01:05:35,346 --> 01:05:37,246
Now, this book I was telling you about...

812
01:05:37,415 --> 01:05:39,940
...the title has just slipped
my memory for the moment.

813
01:05:40,117 --> 01:05:43,245
Well, it's about a mother, which is
a nice idea, I think, don't you?

814
01:05:43,421 --> 01:05:45,616
One reads so much
about the younger generation.

815
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:47,917
It does seem a brilliant idea
to have a change.

816
01:05:48,092 --> 01:05:49,457
Now, this mother isn't old...

817
01:05:50,094 --> 01:05:52,892
I'm sorry to turn up so late,
but I'm stranded for the night.

818
01:05:53,063 --> 01:05:56,624
All the hotels are full.
My flat's uninhabitable.

819
01:05:56,801 --> 01:06:00,202
I told you, it's in the hands
of the decorators.

820
01:06:00,371 --> 01:06:02,100
I know it's a frightful imposition...

821
01:06:02,273 --> 01:06:05,208
...but I wondered if you could
give me a shakedown somewhere?

822
01:06:05,376 --> 01:06:06,934
Well, of course we can.

823
01:06:07,111 --> 01:06:08,442
Can't we, Mother?

824
01:06:08,612 --> 01:06:11,604
Well, it's a little awkward.

825
01:06:12,049 --> 01:06:14,483
Is your father proposing
to stay here too?

826
01:06:14,652 --> 01:06:18,315
Well, Jonathan could have my room,
and I could sleep on the settee.

827
01:06:18,489 --> 01:06:20,548
Where shall we put your father?

828
01:06:23,127 --> 01:06:26,893
No. I'll sleep on the settee,
and you can sleep with your mama.

829
01:06:27,064 --> 01:06:31,398
- I hate to put you to all this trouble.
- Not at all, Mr...? What is your name?

830
01:06:32,369 --> 01:06:33,893
- Jones.
- Brown.

831
01:06:34,071 --> 01:06:37,006
Robinson. Now, Mr. Robinson,
I think we'll make it bye-byes.

832
01:06:37,174 --> 01:06:40,200
A blanket for the commodore,
and we'll all go to bye-byes.

833
01:06:40,377 --> 01:06:43,403
Robinson. I've heard that name before.

834
01:06:47,184 --> 01:06:51,280
No, it won't do. Has Eve gone mad,
turning the house into a hotel in the night?

835
01:06:51,455 --> 01:06:54,356
Who is this man, anyway?
What is his name?

836
01:06:54,525 --> 01:06:56,493
Well, perhaps you better not mention it.

837
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:59,220
The fact is that he's
a fugitive from justice.

838
01:06:59,396 --> 01:07:01,728
The whole police force is on his heels,
and Eve...

839
01:07:01,899 --> 01:07:05,096
Well, for reasons of her own, my dear,
doesn't want him to be caught.

840
01:07:05,269 --> 01:07:06,759
He's...

841
01:07:07,204 --> 01:07:09,365
He's wanted for murder.

842
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:11,974
Now you're going too far.

843
01:07:13,444 --> 01:07:16,902
I suppose you think I believed that
that Mr. Smith, who came here to tea...

844
01:07:17,081 --> 01:07:18,844
...was a real detective.

845
01:07:25,789 --> 01:07:29,555
If I hadn't heard her maid's voice outside
the dressing room, they'd have got me.

846
01:07:29,727 --> 01:07:32,560
Eve, darling, I know I should
never have trusted her.

847
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:36,564
Darling, you've been wonderful to me.
I don't deserve it, but I need you.

848
01:07:37,101 --> 01:07:38,932
I need you more than ever.

849
01:07:39,103 --> 01:07:41,264
Tonight, when I found
what Charlotte was...

850
01:07:41,438 --> 01:07:43,838
...all of a sudden,
I thought my brain would burst.

851
01:07:44,008 --> 01:07:45,805
After all that I'd done for her.

852
01:07:45,976 --> 01:07:49,377
Everything I did for her was because
I loved her and she loved me.

853
01:08:07,765 --> 01:08:10,199
- I'm so sorry.
- Why the umbrella?

854
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,835
It is a garden party, isn't it?

855
01:08:13,003 --> 01:08:15,631
Oh, Roehampton Club, please.

856
01:08:18,909 --> 01:08:23,278
It couldn't be helped, I'm afraid.
You must blame a Miss Doris Tinsdale.

857
01:08:23,447 --> 01:08:26,041
Who is Doris Tinsdale?

858
01:08:26,216 --> 01:08:30,778
She's Charlotte Inwood's temporary dresser.
We've been searching for her all afternoon.

859
01:08:30,955 --> 01:08:32,616
One of our men at the theater...

860
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:36,191
...let her slip through his fingers
without making a statement.

861
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,294
You look very lovely.

862
01:08:39,363 --> 01:08:41,923
You're very sweet to say so.

863
01:08:42,933 --> 01:08:46,232
What has this Doris Tinsdale person
got to do with the case?

864
01:08:46,403 --> 01:08:47,995
Or shouldn't I ask, Mr. Smith?

865
01:08:48,172 --> 01:08:51,699
Well, Cooper was at the theater last night,
and we think she saw him.

866
01:08:51,875 --> 01:08:55,538
And don't call me Mr. Smith.
After all, my name is...

867
01:08:55,713 --> 01:08:57,237
Wilfred.

868
01:08:58,015 --> 01:08:59,676
Not very good, is it?

869
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:02,478
It suits some people very nicely.

870
01:09:02,953 --> 01:09:06,252
I rather liked it when you called me
"Ordinary Smith."

871
01:09:06,423 --> 01:09:09,915
- Oh, I didn't mean to, really.
- But I liked it. I liked it very much.

872
01:09:10,094 --> 01:09:12,460
Please go on calling me that, will you?

873
01:09:13,197 --> 01:09:15,529
Yes, I will.

874
01:09:17,167 --> 01:09:19,158
What were we talking about?

875
01:09:19,737 --> 01:09:24,970
Oh, yes. I was going to ask you,
why did Cooper risk going to the theater?

876
01:09:25,142 --> 01:09:28,600
He must have had a very strong reason
for wanting to talk to Miss Inwood.

877
01:09:28,779 --> 01:09:33,011
- Let's not talk shop on a day like this.
- Oh, I am sorry.

878
01:09:33,183 --> 01:09:35,048
Do you hate inquisitive people?

879
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:37,719
Of course not. I'm one myself.

880
01:09:37,888 --> 01:09:43,952
But seriously, Ordinary, do you think there's
anything between Cooper and Miss Inwood?

881
01:09:44,795 --> 01:09:50,199
Seriously, "Extraordinary,"
I shouldn't be a bit surprised.

882
01:09:54,138 --> 01:09:57,039
What a curious person she must be.

883
01:09:57,608 --> 01:10:02,636
I mean, going back on the stage
so soon after everything.

884
01:10:03,213 --> 01:10:04,510
The show must go on.

885
01:10:04,682 --> 01:10:08,880
A smiling face, a breaking heart.
Actors rather like it, I'm told.

886
01:10:10,554 --> 01:10:12,181
But today...

887
01:10:12,356 --> 01:10:15,348
...going right from the funeral
to the garden party.

888
01:10:15,926 --> 01:10:18,759
I must say, I think that's
overdoing things a bit.

889
01:10:18,929 --> 01:10:22,160
A strong sense of the dramatics
and all that sort of thing.

890
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,861
It's...

891
01:10:25,636 --> 01:10:28,400
...so cold and calculating of her.

892
01:10:30,074 --> 01:10:31,564
Is it?

893
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:35,275
Yes, it is.

894
01:10:37,114 --> 01:10:41,574
If she's that cold and calculating,
I was wondering...

895
01:10:41,752 --> 01:10:45,279
...maybe she had something to do
with her husband's death.

896
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:47,948
Were you?

897
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:50,950
After all...

898
01:10:51,128 --> 01:10:53,858
...there must be a lot
that doesn't appear on the surface.

899
01:10:54,364 --> 01:10:57,333
I mean, like...

900
01:10:57,501 --> 01:10:59,935
...wheels within wheels.

901
01:11:00,804 --> 01:11:04,467
Who...? Who knows what goes on
in a woman's mind?

902
01:11:06,009 --> 01:11:07,499
I don't know.

903
01:11:08,445 --> 01:11:11,107
And if I don't know, I...

904
01:11:11,281 --> 01:11:12,771
Well...

905
01:11:13,283 --> 01:11:15,046
...who?

906
01:11:15,219 --> 01:11:18,518
A woman's mind sometimes...

907
01:11:19,957 --> 01:11:23,290
I was saying that a woman's mind...

908
01:11:24,528 --> 01:11:26,223
That's right.

909
01:11:27,531 --> 01:11:29,021
Do you really?

910
01:11:30,634 --> 01:11:32,226
I think so too.

911
01:11:33,203 --> 01:11:35,603
In Miss Inwood's case?

912
01:11:35,773 --> 01:11:37,104
What?

913
01:11:38,008 --> 01:11:39,236
What?

914
01:12:09,373 --> 01:12:12,706
I have to report to the committee tent
to get my programs.

915
01:12:13,177 --> 01:12:17,238
- <i>whether to give it to the orphans</i>
<i>or to let the government take it.</i>

916
01:12:17,414 --> 01:12:19,507
<i>I'm putting it to you!</i>

917
01:12:19,683 --> 01:12:21,446
There's the committee tent over there.

918
01:12:21,618 --> 01:12:24,951
You do understand I won't be able to spend
the whole afternoon with you?

919
01:12:25,122 --> 01:12:28,614
Can't I go with you? I can sell a mean
program. We bloodhounds have methods.

920
01:12:28,792 --> 01:12:31,590
But you must go and amuse yourself.
I can't take you with me.

921
01:12:31,762 --> 01:12:35,220
Every time I begin to think I know
what color your eyes are, you disappear.

922
01:12:35,399 --> 01:12:39,426
But it's against the rules. Now please go.
I'll pick you up later. I'll get in trouble.

923
01:12:39,603 --> 01:12:44,131
<i>Right here. Step right up.</i>
<i>Yes, madam. Over here...</i>

924
01:12:44,308 --> 01:12:47,971
Eve, you brute. Wherever have you been?
You're hours late.

925
01:12:48,145 --> 01:12:50,807
- I'm sorry, Chubby.
- What a day. What a day.

926
01:12:50,981 --> 01:12:52,471
- Hello, Valerie.
- Hello, Eve.

927
01:12:52,649 --> 01:12:55,641
Oh, this is Wilfred Smith.
Chubby Bannister and Valerie Maynard.

928
01:12:55,819 --> 01:12:57,286
They're at RADA with me.

929
01:12:57,454 --> 01:13:00,321
- Well, how do you do, Mr. Smith?
- How do you do?

930
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:03,118
I'm sure you'd love some ice cream.
Chubby could show you where it is.

931
01:13:03,293 --> 01:13:05,557
- Oh, but I'd adore to.
- That's most good of you.

932
01:13:05,729 --> 01:13:09,426
I hope you'll remember me by this little
token of my regard and esteem.

933
01:13:10,434 --> 01:13:11,662
Allow me.

934
01:13:11,835 --> 01:13:16,169
<i>As you know, this fete is being held</i>
<i>for the aid of the Actors' Orphanage.</i>

935
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:19,969
<i>Now, it's raining outside, and if you've</i>
<i>got half a pound to spare, come in...</i>

936
01:13:20,143 --> 01:13:21,440
Which programs shall I take?

937
01:13:21,612 --> 01:13:23,876
- Take that pile, dear.
- Thank you.

938
01:13:33,891 --> 01:13:37,759
You newspaperwomen work hard
at your job, don't you, Miss Gill?

939
01:13:37,928 --> 01:13:39,259
How did you know my name?

940
01:13:39,429 --> 01:13:41,556
Called that number you gave me
for emergency.

941
01:13:41,732 --> 01:13:45,429
A Mrs. Gill answered,
and I put two and two together.

942
01:13:45,602 --> 01:13:48,969
- What did you need me for in such a hurry?
- Don't talk to me like that.

943
01:13:49,139 --> 01:13:52,040
I've come down here to tell you
Miss Inwood's looking for you.

944
01:13:52,209 --> 01:13:55,269
- What does she want?
- She wants your head, of course.

945
01:13:55,445 --> 01:13:58,937
What's more, she said the police want
to talk to a Miss Doris Tinsdale.

946
01:13:59,116 --> 01:14:01,516
She wants to know when I'm going
back to my work.

947
01:14:01,685 --> 01:14:03,846
I told her my stomach
was still out of order.

948
01:14:04,021 --> 01:14:05,488
Well, it's better now.

949
01:14:05,656 --> 01:14:08,819
- Much better, thank you.
- You want more money, don't you?

950
01:14:08,992 --> 01:14:13,429
Well, look at the risk I'm running. I'd better
go to Miss Inwood and tell her everything.

951
01:14:13,597 --> 01:14:17,465
And before that detective finds out
there's no such person as Doris.

952
01:14:18,602 --> 01:14:20,900
Here's 5 pounds. It's all I have with me.

953
01:14:22,072 --> 01:14:25,132
Oh, my job's worth more than that,
at least another 20.

954
01:14:25,309 --> 01:14:28,801
I'll meet you outside Miss Inwood's tent
in half an hour.

955
01:14:33,817 --> 01:14:36,081
Finished already? You are doing well.

956
01:14:36,253 --> 01:14:39,552
- May I use your phone?
- Why, yes, of course, my dear. There it is.

957
01:14:39,723 --> 01:14:41,315
Thank you.

958
01:14:48,665 --> 01:14:50,098
Hello. Is that you, Father?

959
01:14:50,267 --> 01:14:53,930
Could you come right away? With all
the money you can lay your hands on.

960
01:14:54,104 --> 01:14:56,368
At least 20 pounds. At least!

961
01:14:56,873 --> 01:14:58,306
It's Nellie.

962
01:14:58,475 --> 01:15:00,909
The girl I'm understudying.

963
01:15:01,078 --> 01:15:03,171
Yes. Be quick, darling.

964
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:04,869
<i>No queuing.</i>

965
01:15:05,148 --> 01:15:07,343
<i>No queuing here.</i>
<i>Step right up.</i>

966
01:15:07,517 --> 01:15:10,918
<i>Yes, madam, over here...</i>

967
01:15:11,421 --> 01:15:13,286
Doris, isn't it?

968
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,289
Yes, sir.

969
01:15:19,629 --> 01:15:23,258
Yes, sir. I took your advice, sir.
I done myself up.

970
01:15:23,433 --> 01:15:25,697
I mean, what do you think of it?

971
01:15:25,869 --> 01:15:28,337
- Where have you been?
- Oh, I can explain it, sir.

972
01:15:28,505 --> 01:15:31,269
- Only yesterday...
- Come along. I'll take you to Miss Inwood.

973
01:15:31,441 --> 01:15:33,306
Come on, hurry.

974
01:15:34,344 --> 01:15:39,873
<i>Roll up, roll up, roll up. Come and have</i>
<i>a good time. Come on, sir. You, sir...</i>

975
01:15:42,586 --> 01:15:44,178
Miss Tinsdale to see you.

976
01:15:44,354 --> 01:15:47,619
Well, this is a pleasure. Where have
you been? I thought you were dead.

977
01:15:47,791 --> 01:15:51,591
Oh, no, madam. I wasn't.
As a matter of fact...

978
01:15:51,762 --> 01:15:55,960
You needn't go into detail. I hope you're not
turning into one of those explicit people...

979
01:15:56,133 --> 01:15:59,034
...who always tell you exactly
how they feel when you ask them.

980
01:15:59,202 --> 01:16:01,329
You did leave me a trifle suspended,
however.

981
01:16:01,505 --> 01:16:03,268
I'm sorry, madam.

982
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,032
I was held up.

983
01:16:06,176 --> 01:16:07,871
Darling!

984
01:16:08,045 --> 01:16:10,946
Whatever happened to that
peculiar figure of yours?

985
01:16:11,748 --> 01:16:13,306
It's a new dress, madam.

986
01:16:13,483 --> 01:16:15,144
Keep it, dear.

987
01:16:15,318 --> 01:16:17,445
What it does for you is worth thousands.

988
01:16:17,621 --> 01:16:19,088
I bought it at a sale.

989
01:16:19,256 --> 01:16:22,225
Don't confide in me.
Just pour some tea, would you?

990
01:16:25,862 --> 01:16:27,955
By the way, Doris...

991
01:16:28,131 --> 01:16:31,294
...did Nellie tell you the police
want to talk to you?

992
01:16:31,468 --> 01:16:33,800
But whatever for, madam?

993
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:36,029
Oh, I hope they won't upset my dad.

994
01:16:36,206 --> 01:16:39,004
- My dad said...
- They're not going to eat you, darling.

995
01:16:39,176 --> 01:16:43,169
It's not important. Just pull yourself
together and pour the tea.

996
01:16:47,784 --> 01:16:50,753
Rehearsals from morning till night.
If we wanted to misbehave...

997
01:16:50,921 --> 01:16:53,321
...we couldn't find a minute to do it in.
- No.

998
01:16:53,490 --> 01:16:56,948
Yes, so I understand. Eve tells me she kept
hard at it all day and evening.

999
01:16:57,127 --> 01:17:00,961
But Eve hasn't been near for days. I thought
she was home with a cold or something.

1000
01:17:01,131 --> 01:17:04,123
- Maybe she's got a job in a show.
- Gosh.

1001
01:17:04,301 --> 01:17:08,135
<i>A fortune in five minutes,</i>
<i>and there's no income tax on it tonight.</i>

1002
01:17:22,686 --> 01:17:25,246
Excuse me, madam. I've...

1003
01:17:25,422 --> 01:17:27,481
I've got to sneeze.

1004
01:17:51,548 --> 01:17:53,846
- Miss Livingston, I presume.
- That's not my name.

1005
01:17:54,017 --> 01:17:57,748
Oh, no, no. It's Nellie Goode, isn't it?
But what does the name matter?

1006
01:17:57,921 --> 01:18:01,254
After all, I could think of lots of much
more appropriate names for you.

1007
01:18:01,424 --> 01:18:03,915
Yes, I could think of a few for you too.
Who are you?

1008
01:18:05,495 --> 01:18:08,896
I understand my daughter has entered
into a somewhat shady transaction.

1009
01:18:09,065 --> 01:18:12,831
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Well, you are a blackmailer, aren't you?

1010
01:18:13,003 --> 01:18:15,631
You know, that's a very,
very naughty thing to be.

1011
01:18:15,805 --> 01:18:19,468
Don't say things like that to me.
You could be had up for a thing like that.

1012
01:18:19,643 --> 01:18:21,042
Now, don't be so peppery.

1013
01:18:21,211 --> 01:18:24,510
- I like to keep things on a friendly basis.
- One short.

1014
01:18:24,681 --> 01:18:27,013
It's all I've got. You don't want
me to walk home...

1015
01:18:27,184 --> 01:18:29,209
I don't care if you crawl home.

1016
01:18:29,386 --> 01:18:33,982
Oh, well, it doesn't matter. I'm not mean.
And you've got till tomorrow morning.

1017
01:18:34,758 --> 01:18:37,818
Father, Freddie Williams, Charlotte's
manager, spotted me as Doris.

1018
01:18:37,994 --> 01:18:40,394
I had to go into Charlotte's tent.

1019
01:18:40,564 --> 01:18:43,089
If there's one thing I hate,
it's saying I told you so.

1020
01:18:43,266 --> 01:18:46,599
And the police want to talk to Doris.
I don't know which way to turn.

1021
01:18:46,770 --> 01:18:49,295
I think I'll get Smith
and tell him the whole story.

1022
01:18:49,472 --> 01:18:51,667
Have you got him to suspect
Charlotte yet?

1023
01:18:52,242 --> 01:18:53,607
I'm afraid not.

1024
01:18:54,578 --> 01:18:58,537
But I thought you had to pick him up at
Whitehall. Didn't you talk to him about it?

1025
01:18:59,282 --> 01:19:01,341
But, yes, I did...

1026
01:19:01,952 --> 01:19:03,783
...in a way.

1027
01:19:05,088 --> 01:19:06,680
In a way?

1028
01:19:06,856 --> 01:19:08,983
Oh, I see.

1029
01:19:09,159 --> 01:19:12,925
Some more important topic arose
in the conversation.

1030
01:19:13,096 --> 01:19:16,361
Only there's one slight complication,
my dear: Jonathan.

1031
01:19:16,533 --> 01:19:19,934
You're not, by any chance, thinking
of changing horses in midstream?

1032
01:19:20,103 --> 01:19:22,230
Father, is it awful of me?

1033
01:19:22,405 --> 01:19:25,067
Not awful, my dear,
just rather a bad bit of timing.

1034
01:19:25,242 --> 01:19:27,335
No matter how my feelings
toward him change...

1035
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:29,774
...I still can't let Jonathan down, can I?

1036
01:19:29,946 --> 01:19:32,471
Not while he's hiding in our house.

1037
01:19:44,861 --> 01:19:48,854
Call yourself an actress? There's your
big scene, if you have the pluck to take it.

1038
01:19:49,032 --> 01:19:52,866
You have the law on your arm. All you have
to do is rush in there and shout, "Stop!

1039
01:19:53,036 --> 01:19:54,833
That woman is a murderess!"

1040
01:19:55,005 --> 01:19:58,668
And then she'll say, "How dare you?"
And you'll say, "I'll dare and dare again.

1041
01:19:58,842 --> 01:20:02,710
What about the bloodstained dress,
eh, Miss Charlotte Inwood?"

1042
01:20:02,879 --> 01:20:06,645
- And then she'll say...
- Please. This is serious, Father.

1043
01:20:06,816 --> 01:20:09,944
- Oh, Eve! There you are.
- I couldn't find you anywhere.

1044
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:14,750
- I've been trying to get rid of my programs.
- I've been too busy talking to sell mine.

1045
01:20:14,924 --> 01:20:16,448
Do you think I talk too much?

1046
01:20:16,626 --> 01:20:18,389
No. Most women don't talk enough.

1047
01:20:18,561 --> 01:20:22,361
- I hate shy women.
- No one could ever call me shy...

1048
01:20:45,455 --> 01:20:47,821
Who'll come over to shoot
some lovely ducks?

1049
01:20:47,991 --> 01:20:51,392
It will only cost you half a crown,
and it does such good for the orphans.

1050
01:20:51,561 --> 01:20:54,894
Who'll come and shoot lovely ducks
here for half a crown?

1051
01:20:55,065 --> 01:20:58,193
Only half a crown to shoot lovely ducks!

1052
01:21:03,073 --> 01:21:04,597
Eve.

1053
01:21:06,376 --> 01:21:08,344
Excuse me.

1054
01:21:09,045 --> 01:21:11,741
Look, Eve, hold everything.
I have an idea.

1055
01:21:11,915 --> 01:21:16,409
Get Smith into Charlotte's tent,
as near the front as you can.

1056
01:21:16,586 --> 01:21:18,781
Go on, quickly.

1057
01:21:20,957 --> 01:21:23,517
- What do you say we hear Charlotte sing?
- Oh, do let's.

1058
01:21:23,693 --> 01:21:26,662
The murder makes her so interesting.

1059
01:21:27,864 --> 01:21:31,163
- You know, I think I'll wait outside.
- But you promised.

1060
01:21:31,801 --> 01:21:34,429
- I promised?
- In the taxi.

1061
01:21:34,604 --> 01:21:37,801
You said the first thing we'd do would be
to go hear Charlotte Inwood.

1062
01:21:37,974 --> 01:21:39,566
Don't you remember?

1063
01:21:40,810 --> 01:21:42,744
Do you know? I can't remember.

1064
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:45,142
I must have had some sort of a blackout.

1065
01:21:46,549 --> 01:21:49,780
- Oh, do let's hurry. We'll miss her.
- I think she's just dreamy.

1066
01:21:49,953 --> 01:21:52,945
Only half a crown to shoot a lovely duck!

1067
01:21:53,123 --> 01:21:55,353
You can win a lovely prize!
Heavenly prizes!

1068
01:21:55,525 --> 01:21:58,050
Only half a crown to shoot...
Would you like to shoot?

1069
01:21:58,228 --> 01:22:01,425
No, no. I hate firearms. I wonder
if I could buy one of those dolls.

1070
01:22:01,598 --> 01:22:02,826
- A doll?
- Yes, please.

1071
01:22:02,999 --> 01:22:04,762
- Which doll?
- Oh, any doll. That doll.

1072
01:22:04,934 --> 01:22:08,370
- I suppose, but you'll have to pay for it.
- I know, but how much, please?

1073
01:22:08,538 --> 01:22:11,336
- Well, it's for the orphans.
- Yes, I know, but how much?

1074
01:22:11,508 --> 01:22:15,137
- You are sorry for the orphans, aren't you?
- Of course I am, but how much?

1075
01:22:15,311 --> 01:22:18,303
We all are, aren't we? Well, I suppose...

1076
01:22:18,481 --> 01:22:20,506
...at least four pounds.

1077
01:22:22,652 --> 01:22:25,212
- Give me the gun.
- Well, half a crown, then.

1078
01:22:25,388 --> 01:22:28,653
- Yes.
- You know. Money first.

1079
01:22:30,727 --> 01:22:32,820
- Now, shall I put it in for you?
- Yes, please.

1080
01:22:32,996 --> 01:22:35,021
It breaks somewhere here. I can't...

1081
01:22:35,198 --> 01:22:38,190
It's rather...

1082
01:22:38,368 --> 01:22:40,268
Perhaps I can manage.

1083
01:22:40,437 --> 01:22:44,066
Wait a minute. I think you'll have to do
it yourself. I'm not frightfully good.

1084
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:46,868
Be rather careful, won't you?
You know, it goes off.

1085
01:22:52,282 --> 01:22:54,182
Got you again, my beauty.

1086
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:56,409
My bird, I think, sir.

1087
01:22:56,586 --> 01:22:57,985
Could I have the doll, please?

1088
01:22:58,154 --> 01:23:00,122
What did you say?

1089
01:23:02,559 --> 01:23:03,821
Good shot, sir.

1090
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:06,658
Well done. I'll get you your doll.

1091
01:23:09,399 --> 01:23:12,334
Here you are, sir. Now, then,
who's going to shoot lovely ducks?

1092
01:23:12,502 --> 01:23:14,436
Would you like to shoot lovely ducks?

1093
01:23:14,604 --> 01:23:17,072
- Yes. Half a crown's worth.
- You sure that's enough?

1094
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:21,336
Oh, yes, certainly. Yes, I don't need
any more. I very seldom miss.

1095
01:23:30,019 --> 01:23:32,385
Oh, got it at last. Could I have
the doll, please?

1096
01:23:32,555 --> 01:23:35,524
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm afraid that's mine.

1097
01:23:35,692 --> 01:23:37,387
What did you say?

1098
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,687
Nothing at all.

1099
01:23:40,463 --> 01:23:44,092
- Could I have the doll, please?
- Well done. I'll go and get it for you.

1100
01:23:44,267 --> 01:23:46,861
It is rather nice, I think,
to have won it, don't you?

1101
01:23:47,036 --> 01:23:50,972
You did earn it that time. They're lovely
dolls. They're fully dressed. Fully.

1102
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:52,607
Thank you very much.

1103
01:23:52,775 --> 01:23:56,609
Now, who's going to come and shoot lovely
duck over here for only half a crown?

1104
01:23:56,779 --> 01:24:00,647
We're having such fun over here shooting
duck for only half a crown!

1105
01:25:30,807 --> 01:25:32,035
Eve.

1106
01:25:32,375 --> 01:25:33,603
Eve.

1107
01:26:27,063 --> 01:26:28,291
I'm sorry.

1108
01:26:28,798 --> 01:26:30,459
Ladies and gentlemen.

1109
01:26:35,738 --> 01:26:37,729
Doris. Doris!

1110
01:26:37,907 --> 01:26:39,704
Miss Tinsdale!

1111
01:26:41,077 --> 01:26:42,374
Come and give a hand here.

1112
01:26:44,714 --> 01:26:46,306
What are you waiting for?

1113
01:27:00,430 --> 01:27:02,193
I'm sorry, sir.

1114
01:27:15,912 --> 01:27:19,245
<i>Do you think there's anything between</i>
<i>Cooper and Miss Inwood?</i>

1115
01:27:19,415 --> 01:27:21,508
<i>But Eve hasn't been near for days.</i>

1116
01:27:21,684 --> 01:27:23,549
<i>Doris! Miss Tinsdale!</i>

1117
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:26,511
We got away as quickly as possible,
and here we are.

1118
01:27:26,689 --> 01:27:30,648
And that's the story of the short
and stormy life of Doris Tinsdale.

1119
01:27:30,827 --> 01:27:33,193
It is in many respects a sad one,
but, one hopes...

1120
01:27:33,362 --> 01:27:35,796
...not entirely without usefulness.

1121
01:27:35,965 --> 01:27:38,991
The next thing is to wait
for the arrival of Mr. Ordinary Smith...

1122
01:27:39,168 --> 01:27:41,830
...with his posse to arrest
the whole boiling lot of us.

1123
01:27:42,004 --> 01:27:45,132
Well, you think I should give myself up,
is that it?

1124
01:27:45,575 --> 01:27:49,341
Yes, I should, shouldn't I? The longer
I stay here, the worse it will be for you.

1125
01:27:49,512 --> 01:27:53,073
But I won't give up. There must be
a way to get at Charlotte.

1126
01:27:53,249 --> 01:27:57,015
Now, I've made a nice hot toddy
for you, Mr. Robinson.

1127
01:27:57,186 --> 01:27:59,620
There's nothing like it for a cold,
is there?

1128
01:27:59,789 --> 01:28:01,188
Thank you.

1129
01:28:01,557 --> 01:28:05,755
Isn't it dreadful? Mr. Robinson hasn't been
able to stir out of his room since he arrived.

1130
01:28:05,928 --> 01:28:07,896
These spring colds are really frightful.

1131
01:28:08,064 --> 01:28:11,761
Oh, by the way, Eve, Mr. Smith
is downstairs and wants to see you.

1132
01:28:11,934 --> 01:28:13,731
I think it would be such a good idea...

1133
01:28:13,903 --> 01:28:17,395
...if I made Mr. Robinson a nice,
hot mustard plaster.

1134
01:28:17,573 --> 01:28:19,564
I wonder if he's got a temperature.

1135
01:28:19,742 --> 01:28:23,337
I've broken my thermometer, but you could
easily run to the chemist's...

1136
01:28:41,063 --> 01:28:43,691
How long have you been
Miss Inwood's maid?

1137
01:28:44,667 --> 01:28:48,330
As I think you know, we've been anxious
to ask Doris Tinsdale a few questions.

1138
01:28:48,504 --> 01:28:51,996
- I can explain...
- Did you talk to Jonathan Cooper last night?

1139
01:28:52,441 --> 01:28:54,341
- No.
- Did you see him?

1140
01:28:55,211 --> 01:28:56,542
- Yes.
- Where?

1141
01:28:57,914 --> 01:28:59,939
On his way to Miss Inwood's dressing room.

1142
01:29:00,116 --> 01:29:02,710
He was there when she went up to change.

1143
01:29:02,885 --> 01:29:05,820
I listened at the door and overheard
him say something about...

1144
01:29:05,988 --> 01:29:08,582
...a bloodstained dress belonging to her.

1145
01:29:08,758 --> 01:29:11,226
And then suddenly, she became afraid.

1146
01:29:11,394 --> 01:29:13,453
Do you hear? Afraid.

1147
01:29:13,996 --> 01:29:16,157
When you took Sergeant Loomis
up to the room...

1148
01:29:16,332 --> 01:29:18,459
...you presumed Cooper to be still there?

1149
01:29:18,835 --> 01:29:20,530
Well, I didn't know.

1150
01:29:20,703 --> 01:29:23,103
No, you didn't know,
but you had a pretty fair idea.

1151
01:29:23,272 --> 01:29:25,035
Why didn't you tell Loomis?

1152
01:29:25,875 --> 01:29:30,744
Then you did a very neat fainting fit, which
probably allowed Cooper to get clear away.

1153
01:29:32,682 --> 01:29:34,912
Don't talk like that.

1154
01:29:35,084 --> 01:29:37,314
I can't bear it.

1155
01:29:42,225 --> 01:29:44,250
I don't understand it.

1156
01:29:46,162 --> 01:29:49,598
- How could you behave like that?
- But I can explain.

1157
01:29:50,499 --> 01:29:52,126
I don't think that's necessary.

1158
01:29:52,301 --> 01:29:56,362
In my job, I find a woman goes to almost
any length to protect her lover.

1159
01:29:56,572 --> 01:29:58,164
But it's not like that.

1160
01:29:58,341 --> 01:30:00,241
It's not like that at all.

1161
01:30:00,409 --> 01:30:02,809
I thought I was in love with Jonathan...

1162
01:30:02,979 --> 01:30:04,776
...but I'm not anymore.

1163
01:30:05,915 --> 01:30:09,510
But it doesn't mean I won't go on
helping him, as I would any innocent man.

1164
01:30:09,685 --> 01:30:13,621
It's not for you to decide whether he's
innocent or not. You leave that to the law.

1165
01:30:13,789 --> 01:30:16,019
The point is, you put yourself
and your father...

1166
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:19,491
...in a very serious position
by this infernal amateur meddling.

1167
01:30:20,830 --> 01:30:23,390
How I'm going to get you out of it,
I don't know.

1168
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,529
But you do want to get us out?

1169
01:30:28,137 --> 01:30:31,004
In spite of the fact you made such
a fool of me, you mean.

1170
01:30:32,341 --> 01:30:34,866
Your acting in the taxi
was extremely clever.

1171
01:30:39,782 --> 01:30:42,114
I wasn't acting in the taxi.

1172
01:30:43,619 --> 01:30:47,578
I fell in love with someone,
and all my plans went out the window.

1173
01:30:48,958 --> 01:30:53,861
When we were in the taxi together, I felt
as though I were on a great golden cloud.

1174
01:30:54,764 --> 01:30:59,292
I told Father I didn't want to go on
with this. I wanted to tell you everything.

1175
01:30:59,468 --> 01:31:03,564
But he had an idea about
a bloodstained doll, and I had to put it off.

1176
01:31:04,674 --> 01:31:06,904
I wanted to tell you all about it.

1177
01:31:07,643 --> 01:31:09,508
Please believe me.

1178
01:31:12,615 --> 01:31:15,516
Would you like to mix a cocktail
yourself, Mr. Smith?

1179
01:31:15,685 --> 01:31:19,644
I'm afraid there's no ice,
but I'm sure you can manage.

1180
01:31:21,691 --> 01:31:23,852
- Good evening, Smith.
- Good evening.

1181
01:31:24,226 --> 01:31:27,195
- Do I hear the muted clanking of chains?
- It's only the plumbing.

1182
01:31:27,363 --> 01:31:29,024
It's in a dreadful state.

1183
01:31:29,198 --> 01:31:31,291
How did you enjoy the garden party,
Mr. Smith?

1184
01:31:31,467 --> 01:31:33,662
It must have been awful in that rain.

1185
01:31:33,836 --> 01:31:37,328
I think I'll take some sherry
up to Mr. Robinson.

1186
01:31:37,506 --> 01:31:41,237
I've quite changed my mind about him.
He seems such a nice young man after all.

1187
01:31:41,410 --> 01:31:44,743
Eve, dear, you will look after
Mr. Smith, won't you?

1188
01:31:46,983 --> 01:31:50,612
Father, I've been explaining to Mr. Smith
what we're trying to do.

1189
01:31:50,786 --> 01:31:52,845
He thinks we ought to stop.

1190
01:31:53,022 --> 01:31:54,819
Oh, what a pity.

1191
01:31:54,991 --> 01:31:58,552
Just when you and I were about to save
Mr. Smith so much trouble.

1192
01:31:59,362 --> 01:32:01,489
Save me trouble?

1193
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:05,031
Sir, you don't look like an irresponsible
imbecile. Why behave like one?

1194
01:32:05,201 --> 01:32:09,638
You let your daughter get mixed up in this?
What sort of father do you think you are?

1195
01:32:09,805 --> 01:32:12,239
Unique. Quite unique.

1196
01:32:12,408 --> 01:32:16,174
But rather broken-hearted at this moment.
You see, I have another idea.

1197
01:32:16,345 --> 01:32:18,870
A pity to waste ideas, isn't it?

1198
01:32:19,882 --> 01:32:23,716
Have you...? Have you ever
been blackmailed, Mr. Smith?

1199
01:32:23,886 --> 01:32:26,286
Well, I have. Only this afternoon.

1200
01:32:26,455 --> 01:32:28,980
At least my daughter and I were,
by Nellie Goode.

1201
01:32:29,158 --> 01:32:32,321
Yes, most inappropriate name.
I told her so.

1202
01:32:32,495 --> 01:32:36,261
She touched us for 24 pounds, and do you
know why I think it was well-spent?

1203
01:32:36,932 --> 01:32:40,197
- Though we could ill afford it.
- Come to the point, please.

1204
01:32:40,369 --> 01:32:44,499
Well, it struck me that what Nellie could do,
Doris could do.

1205
01:32:44,673 --> 01:32:46,834
I mean suppose she went
to Miss Inwood and said:

1206
01:32:47,009 --> 01:32:50,035
"Look, Miss Inwood,
I've got a certain dress of yours.

1207
01:32:50,212 --> 01:32:53,579
It's ruined, but it's still worth money."

1208
01:32:54,116 --> 01:32:59,019
And suppose Miss Inwood said, "All right,
I'll give you 100 pounds for it."

1209
01:32:59,188 --> 01:33:00,587
What then, eh?

1210
01:33:00,756 --> 01:33:04,522
And suppose you happened
to be listening.

1211
01:33:04,727 --> 01:33:08,219
Well, that's what police do
in blackmail cases, isn't it?

1212
01:33:08,397 --> 01:33:10,558
What about it, eh? What about it?

1213
01:33:10,733 --> 01:33:14,669
Oh, you needn't be afraid that Doris
couldn't do it. She could do it, Doris could.

1214
01:33:14,837 --> 01:33:18,933
I mean, Eve could. She's a very good
actress, a very good actress indeed.

1215
01:33:19,108 --> 01:33:20,769
I'm sure she is.

1216
01:33:23,512 --> 01:33:26,481
By the way,
is there a bloodstained dress?

1217
01:33:28,117 --> 01:33:30,711
Well, no. No, not exactly.

1218
01:33:30,886 --> 01:33:34,481
Look, there was
a bloodstained dress, only...

1219
01:33:34,657 --> 01:33:37,285
- Couldn't we tell you...?
- I'm getting back to the office.

1220
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:39,587
I'll let you know about this later.

1221
01:33:43,399 --> 01:33:46,197
In the meantime, what's Miss Inwood
doing without a dresser?

1222
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:50,065
You better run along to the theater before
she starts getting impatient.

1223
01:33:53,242 --> 01:33:54,470
It's all right.

1224
01:33:54,643 --> 01:33:57,612
- What do you mean, "It's all right"?
- He's trying to save face.

1225
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:59,042
Not a bad face, either.

1226
01:33:59,215 --> 01:34:02,378
He'll let us do it. What's the matter
with you? Aren't you pleased?

1227
01:34:03,486 --> 01:34:05,818
Come on. We better hurry.

1228
01:34:06,422 --> 01:34:10,085
Come to Burton Street and bring two men.
Post them at either end of the street.

1229
01:34:10,259 --> 01:34:13,786
I'll be waiting at the telephone booth
at the corner. All right?

1230
01:34:32,581 --> 01:34:36,677
Hello. Is that Mrs. Gill?
Is the commodore available?

1231
01:34:36,852 --> 01:34:40,151
Oh, he's gone out. Is Miss Eve there?

1232
01:34:40,322 --> 01:34:42,950
Oh, she's out too. No, one moment.

1233
01:34:43,125 --> 01:34:46,026
May I speak to Mr. Robinson, please?

1234
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:07,347
- What's your idea, governor?
- Just a little experiment.

1235
01:35:07,516 --> 01:35:09,950
- Plug it in.
- Okay.

1236
01:35:24,867 --> 01:35:26,926
<i>The mike's in position.</i>

1237
01:35:27,102 --> 01:35:30,594
<i>I'm speaking about three foot from it.</i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1238
01:35:32,007 --> 01:35:34,669
- Tell him the sound's all right.
- Okay.

1239
01:35:37,346 --> 01:35:39,473
Do you think it'll work?

1240
01:35:39,648 --> 01:35:41,138
What a day, darling.

1241
01:35:41,317 --> 01:35:44,252
I've never in my whole life been so glad
to see the end of it.

1242
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:46,718
- Yes, madam.
- You must be tired too.

1243
01:35:46,889 --> 01:35:49,517
It can't be easy to be a dresser
with no experience.

1244
01:35:49,692 --> 01:35:53,059
But you're quite good.
Very good, indeed.

1245
01:35:53,229 --> 01:35:56,687
Oh, that rain.
That rain at the garden party.

1246
01:35:56,865 --> 01:36:00,392
Thank goodness it didn't rain at the funeral.
That would have been too much.

1247
01:36:00,569 --> 01:36:02,799
I hate rainy funerals.

1248
01:36:03,105 --> 01:36:05,699
And then somebody sent up
that disgusting doll.

1249
01:36:06,875 --> 01:36:09,605
What vermin some vermin are.

1250
01:36:09,778 --> 01:36:11,302
Yes, madam.

1251
01:36:11,714 --> 01:36:14,148
By the way, did the police find you?

1252
01:36:14,316 --> 01:36:16,181
I haven't seen them yet, madam.

1253
01:36:16,352 --> 01:36:18,547
And anyway,
I've got nothing to tell them.

1254
01:36:18,721 --> 01:36:20,382
Well, I suppose that's all.

1255
01:36:20,556 --> 01:36:23,582
And that horrible Nellie
will be back tomorrow.

1256
01:36:23,926 --> 01:36:28,226
We may never see each other again.
Ships that pass in the something or other.

1257
01:36:28,397 --> 01:36:33,232
I like you. You're so very sweet and patient.
I don't suppose I'm easy to get on with.

1258
01:36:33,402 --> 01:36:36,371
Oh, but you are, madam.
It's been wonderful working with you.

1259
01:36:36,538 --> 01:36:38,768
And I do love the theater so.

1260
01:36:38,941 --> 01:36:41,933
I don't see why. It's an awful life, really.

1261
01:36:42,111 --> 01:36:44,272
Here, darling.
A little something extra for you.

1262
01:36:44,446 --> 01:36:45,743
I couldn't, madam. Honestly.

1263
01:36:45,914 --> 01:36:49,941
Don't be an idiot. Put it in the bank
or go out and get drunk or something.

1264
01:36:50,119 --> 01:36:52,019
- Thank you, madam.
- Can I give you a lift?

1265
01:36:52,187 --> 01:36:55,884
- Lf you would drop me, I'd appreciate it.
- All right. Come along, then.

1266
01:37:05,167 --> 01:37:07,135
- Good night.
- Good night.

1267
01:37:13,609 --> 01:37:15,770
- Good night.
- Good night.

1268
01:37:18,614 --> 01:37:22,607
- Miss Inwood, could I talk to you in private?
- We can talk in the car. That's private.

1269
01:37:22,785 --> 01:37:24,912
No, that won't do.
I've got to talk to you now.

1270
01:37:25,087 --> 01:37:26,714
What's all this about?

1271
01:37:26,889 --> 01:37:29,380
Let's go someplace
where nobody can hear us.

1272
01:37:29,558 --> 01:37:31,185
Good night.

1273
01:37:33,329 --> 01:37:36,765
- Have you gone mad or something?
- No, madam.

1274
01:37:36,932 --> 01:37:40,163
I want to tell you about
the bloodstained doll.

1275
01:37:50,946 --> 01:37:53,073
Well, what about that doll?

1276
01:37:53,782 --> 01:37:56,876
Oh, I hate all this, madam.
I'm that nervous.

1277
01:37:57,052 --> 01:37:59,782
I'm so afraid of doing the wrong thing.

1278
01:37:59,955 --> 01:38:03,857
You see, I have a dress that belongs to you
with a big bloodstain down the front.

1279
01:38:04,026 --> 01:38:06,256
By rights, I know I should
go to the police...

1280
01:38:06,428 --> 01:38:08,953
...but, to tell you the truth,
madam, I'm afraid.

1281
01:38:09,131 --> 01:38:12,157
My dad would murder me
if I got my name in the papers.

1282
01:38:12,334 --> 01:38:15,497
<i>So, you see, I've come to you.</i>
<i>Maybe you could tell me what to do.</i>

1283
01:38:15,671 --> 01:38:17,104
<i>How much do you want?</i>

1284
01:38:17,272 --> 01:38:20,673
<i>Money never entered my head, madam.</i>
<i>I hope you won't think that of me.</i>

1285
01:38:20,843 --> 01:38:25,906
<i>Only if the dress were clean like new,</i>
<i>it might be worth, say, 75 or 100 pounds.</i>

1286
01:38:27,082 --> 01:38:29,050
I know nothing about
a bloodstained dress.

1287
01:38:29,218 --> 01:38:31,880
This sounds to me remarkably
like blackmail.

1288
01:38:32,054 --> 01:38:36,150
- I think I'd better call the police.
- Yes. Do call the police, Miss Inwood.

1289
01:38:37,326 --> 01:38:39,191
We'll talk to them together.

1290
01:38:40,162 --> 01:38:42,926
- You're not the maid.
- No, I'm not.

1291
01:38:45,267 --> 01:38:47,531
Why have you been pretending
all this time?

1292
01:38:48,504 --> 01:38:50,199
Shall we say we needed evidence?

1293
01:38:50,773 --> 01:38:53,970
We? Are you from the police?

1294
01:38:54,443 --> 01:38:57,003
<i>How was the bloodstain</i>
<i>smeared on the dress?</i>

1295
01:38:58,881 --> 01:38:59,870
Who are you?

1296
01:39:00,048 --> 01:39:03,575
Why were you so frightened when Jonathan
said he hadn't destroyed the dress?

1297
01:39:03,752 --> 01:39:07,813
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You do know!

1298
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:09,480
Yes.

1299
01:39:09,658 --> 01:39:11,649
Some blood did splash on my dress.

1300
01:39:11,827 --> 01:39:13,818
I was there when Jonathan
killed my husband.

1301
01:39:13,996 --> 01:39:16,692
- That's not true.
- It is, but I had nothing to do with it.

1302
01:39:16,865 --> 01:39:18,662
Jonathan wanted my name kept out of it.

1303
01:39:18,834 --> 01:39:20,358
He sent me back to his rooms.

1304
01:39:20,536 --> 01:39:23,232
He stayed behind to make it look
like robbery.

1305
01:39:23,405 --> 01:39:26,033
- Then he brought me a clean dress.
- You're lying.

1306
01:39:26,208 --> 01:39:28,733
It's a sacred truth. I swear to you it is.

1307
01:39:28,911 --> 01:39:30,242
<i>Listen, whoever you are...</i>

1308
01:39:30,412 --> 01:39:33,040
<i>... l'll give you anything</i>
<i>if you keep me out of this.</i>

1309
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:36,217
<i>My jewelry is worth over 10,000 pounds.</i>
<i>You can have it all.</i>

1310
01:39:36,385 --> 01:39:39,183
<i>And my furs or money.</i>
<i>How much do you want?</i>

1311
01:39:39,354 --> 01:39:41,151
<i>I'll give you anything. Anything.</i>

1312
01:39:41,323 --> 01:39:44,451
I'm going now to break it up.
Bring them in. I want them together.

1313
01:39:44,626 --> 01:39:47,094
<i>You deliberately tried to pin</i>
<i>it all on Jonathan...</i>

1314
01:39:47,262 --> 01:39:50,754
...<i>assisted by Mr. Freddie Williams.</i>
- <i>It's not true, I tell you. It's not!</i>

1315
01:39:50,933 --> 01:39:53,993
<i>Well, you won't get away with it.</i>
<i>I warn you, that's all.</i>

1316
01:40:26,101 --> 01:40:28,194
I've had a terrible scene
with a lunatic girl.

1317
01:40:28,370 --> 01:40:32,136
First she pretended to be my dresser,
then a detective and tried to blackmail me.

1318
01:40:32,307 --> 01:40:36,300
That's all right, Miss Inwood. You stay here.
I'll have a word with you in a minute.

1319
01:40:37,446 --> 01:40:40,210
Oh, good. They got him.

1320
01:40:41,683 --> 01:40:43,810
Jonathan, what have they done to you?

1321
01:40:43,986 --> 01:40:46,454
Why are you arresting him?

1322
01:40:46,622 --> 01:40:49,318
Mellish, stand by Miss Inwood there!

1323
01:40:49,558 --> 01:40:51,389
Heavens, that must be Cooper.

1324
01:40:52,094 --> 01:40:54,028
Where's Miss Inwood?

1325
01:40:54,830 --> 01:40:57,424
Cover the alleyway in case he used
an emergency door.

1326
01:40:57,599 --> 01:40:59,567
- Where do those stairs lead to?
- Dressing rooms.

1327
01:40:59,735 --> 01:41:02,101
Eve! Eve, come back!

1328
01:41:02,271 --> 01:41:03,636
Where's the nearest telephone?

1329
01:41:03,805 --> 01:41:05,830
- Eve.
- He came through an emergency door.

1330
01:41:06,008 --> 01:41:08,943
Hurry up downstairs. Go on, hurry!

1331
01:41:09,111 --> 01:41:10,976
Get back into the theater.

1332
01:41:11,146 --> 01:41:13,171
Have you been told
to keep an eye on me?

1333
01:41:13,348 --> 01:41:15,839
In a manner of speaking, yes.

1334
01:41:17,152 --> 01:41:20,883
- In that case, may I sit down?
- No harm in that.

1335
01:41:21,490 --> 01:41:22,855
Get me a chair, then.

1336
01:41:23,025 --> 01:41:25,186
Surely, ma'am. Surely.

1337
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:26,759
- <i>Done with the mike?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

1338
01:41:26,929 --> 01:41:30,262
<i>Okay. I wonder if they caught</i>...

1339
01:41:36,939 --> 01:41:38,839
What's the point of going up to the roof?

1340
01:41:39,007 --> 01:41:42,408
He may have doubled back along the alley
and gone up the fire escape.

1341
01:41:42,844 --> 01:41:45,779
- So they've heard everything I said?
- Yes.

1342
01:41:47,749 --> 01:41:52,709
- And it's all in that book?
- All in there, in shorthand.

1343
01:41:52,888 --> 01:41:54,879
How clever of you.

1344
01:41:56,592 --> 01:41:58,822
Things look bad for me, don't they?

1345
01:41:59,628 --> 01:42:03,394
I'm what you'd call an accessory...
I suppose.

1346
01:42:03,565 --> 01:42:04,793
- George!
- Yes?

1347
01:42:04,967 --> 01:42:08,027
Smith wants you down
at the stage doorkeeper's office.

1348
01:42:08,203 --> 01:42:09,192
Thank you, darling.

1349
01:42:09,371 --> 01:42:12,169
We'll need more men to cover
all the rooms in this place...

1350
01:42:13,175 --> 01:42:15,166
It's not all in there.

1351
01:42:16,645 --> 01:42:18,738
- What's your name?
- Mellish.

1352
01:42:21,483 --> 01:42:24,509
- Do you like dogs, Mellish?
- Yes, ma'am, I do.

1353
01:42:25,754 --> 01:42:28,154
But not all dogs.

1354
01:42:28,323 --> 01:42:30,689
If they don't love you,
you don't love them.

1355
01:42:30,859 --> 01:42:32,827
- That's right, isn't it?
- I suppose so.

1356
01:42:34,196 --> 01:42:37,791
I had a dog once. He hated me.

1357
01:42:37,966 --> 01:42:40,901
At last he bit me, and I had him shot.

1358
01:42:42,304 --> 01:42:47,435
When I give all my love and get back
treachery and hatred, it's...

1359
01:42:49,378 --> 01:42:52,404
It's as if my mother
had struck me in the face.

1360
01:42:55,083 --> 01:42:56,914
Do you understand that, Mellish?

1361
01:42:57,085 --> 01:42:59,280
I've heard it takes them
that way sometimes.

1362
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:04,889
Yes. It takes some of them that way.

1363
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:07,458
- Has Miss Inwood gone yet?
- No, she's in the theater.

1364
01:43:07,629 --> 01:43:11,224
- Don't you think he's well away now?
- I'm sure I saw him run down the alley.

1365
01:43:11,667 --> 01:43:12,895
This is Smith.

1366
01:43:13,068 --> 01:43:15,935
We're covering the theater
from the roof to the storeroom.

1367
01:43:16,104 --> 01:43:18,129
- Fine, sir.
- You heard what Miss Inwood said.

1368
01:43:18,306 --> 01:43:20,274
You can't have anything
against Cooper now.

1369
01:43:20,442 --> 01:43:23,900
Nothing, except murder. He killed
Charlotte's husband, all right.

1370
01:43:24,079 --> 01:43:25,706
He's killed before.

1371
01:43:25,881 --> 01:43:27,872
What? What do you mean?

1372
01:43:28,050 --> 01:43:31,679
He got away with it last time with a plea
of self-defense. He won't this time.

1373
01:43:31,853 --> 01:43:33,514
- But Eve.
- She's alone with him now.

1374
01:43:33,689 --> 01:43:36,453
Can't you see, sir?
She's in very great danger.

1375
01:43:51,973 --> 01:43:56,376
It all adds up to a confession,
except she said you killed him.

1376
01:43:56,545 --> 01:43:59,309
Anyone in their right mind
could see she was telling a lie.

1377
01:43:59,481 --> 01:44:02,541
But I don't understand why Smith
arrested you. What happened?

1378
01:44:02,718 --> 01:44:05,243
Somebody phoned and said
the police were on their way.

1379
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:09,049
I made a bolt for it, and they
grabbed me at the street door.

1380
01:44:09,758 --> 01:44:12,488
Funny, that.
Getting me out into the street.

1381
01:44:12,661 --> 01:44:16,324
I suppose Smith didn't want me
to be caught in your house.

1382
01:44:16,565 --> 01:44:18,931
That would have been awkward for you,
wouldn't it?

1383
01:44:19,101 --> 01:44:21,331
I don't think they'll look
for us here for a bit.

1384
01:44:21,503 --> 01:44:24,563
After a while, maybe we can make
a dash through an emergency exit.

1385
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:30,542
Eve. Eve. Eve, wherever you are,
come away from him.

1386
01:44:30,712 --> 01:44:34,170
Come away from him.
He's dangerous. He's a killer.

1387
01:44:34,349 --> 01:44:36,943
Eve? Eve?

1388
01:44:39,788 --> 01:44:43,884
You're right, you know.
Charlotte was telling the truth.

1389
01:44:47,462 --> 01:44:50,590
What she didn't tell you was that
she goaded me into doing it.

1390
01:44:50,766 --> 01:44:53,257
She set me against him
in every way she could.

1391
01:44:53,435 --> 01:44:56,632
She made me think she was crazy
about me, but she wasn't.

1392
01:44:56,805 --> 01:45:01,640
I was to kill her husband to leave
the coast clear for that Freddie Williams.

1393
01:45:01,810 --> 01:45:06,076
I know that now.
She knew the sort of man I was.

1394
01:45:06,248 --> 01:45:09,615
She knows I can't control myself
if I get into a rage.

1395
01:45:09,785 --> 01:45:12,618
Like a fool, I told her
about that girl I'd killed.

1396
01:45:12,788 --> 01:45:15,985
Oh, Jonathan. Jonathan,
you don't know what you're saying.

1397
01:45:16,158 --> 01:45:20,822
I can't help it, Eve. I can't control
myself, even when I was a kid.

1398
01:45:21,463 --> 01:45:25,866
I was lucky that last time. The little
fool threatened me with a gun.

1399
01:45:26,034 --> 01:45:29,595
But you don't know what it's like
to have a thing like this hanging over you.

1400
01:45:30,105 --> 01:45:36,374
Eve, I hated to tell you that
phony story in your car that time...

1401
01:45:36,545 --> 01:45:38,775
...but there was no other way.

1402
01:45:40,048 --> 01:45:44,007
Charlotte did go on to my flat
after I'd killed her husband.

1403
01:45:44,186 --> 01:45:49,180
Her dress was stained a bit,
so I brought her a clean one.

1404
01:45:49,357 --> 01:45:51,484
Then when she went to the theater...

1405
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:54,390
...I made a big stain on it
to make you believe me.

1406
01:45:56,064 --> 01:45:58,862
I'm telling you the truth now.

1407
01:46:02,504 --> 01:46:04,369
Jonathan...

1408
01:46:05,707 --> 01:46:08,369
...I feel desperately sorry for you.

1409
01:46:08,543 --> 01:46:10,534
Really, I do.

1410
01:46:11,947 --> 01:46:15,940
No, you don't. You're not sorry at all.

1411
01:46:16,117 --> 01:46:17,709
You don't care what happens to me.

1412
01:46:22,357 --> 01:46:24,052
Jonathan...

1413
01:46:24,693 --> 01:46:29,187
...you could give yourself up.
They'd take care of you.

1414
01:46:29,364 --> 01:46:32,458
You couldn't do all these things
unless you...

1415
01:46:33,201 --> 01:46:34,930
Unless...

1416
01:46:36,538 --> 01:46:42,443
They can't do anything to a sick man,
and that's what you are. You must be.

1417
01:46:42,777 --> 01:46:47,840
No. They're going to hang me.
They'll hang Charlotte, too, for planning it.

1418
01:46:48,717 --> 01:46:52,380
They've never forgiven me for getting
away with it the first time.

1419
01:46:52,554 --> 01:46:57,924
There's nothing wrong with my mind.
Nobody can prove that there is, unless...

1420
01:47:08,536 --> 01:47:11,232
Unless I do it a third time...

1421
01:47:11,406 --> 01:47:14,603
...with no reason whatever.

1422
01:47:15,176 --> 01:47:19,010
That would be a clear case of insanity.

1423
01:47:19,781 --> 01:47:21,214
Wouldn't it?

1424
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:26,444
Wouldn't it?

1425
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:43,230
Jonathan. Jonathan,
I don't hear a sound now.

1426
01:47:44,372 --> 01:47:47,000
I think we can go now.

1427
01:47:47,175 --> 01:47:51,168
We'll go out through the orchestra pit,
and then I'll take you to my father's boat.

1428
01:47:53,982 --> 01:47:55,506
Come along.

1429
01:48:23,311 --> 01:48:25,211
Here he is!

1430
01:48:27,916 --> 01:48:30,646
Look! In the orchestra pit!

1431
01:48:34,022 --> 01:48:37,423
Mathews, quick! Down in the orchestra!

1432
01:48:43,898 --> 01:48:46,696
- They've got him!
- Where?

1433
01:48:46,935 --> 01:48:48,766
- They found him.
- Where was he?

1434
01:48:48,937 --> 01:48:51,462
- He was in the theater after all.
- Call Smith!

1435
01:48:51,639 --> 01:48:55,268
- He was at the stage doorkeeper's office.
- Drop the iron curtain, cut him off!

1436
01:48:55,443 --> 01:48:57,570
Get out! Move your head
out of the way!

1437
01:49:08,490 --> 01:49:11,482
- Take the curtain up.
- Don't touch anything.

1438
01:49:11,659 --> 01:49:14,594
Mellish, you'd better phone
up the photographer.

1439
01:49:14,829 --> 01:49:19,163
Someone find out if Byard's here yet.
Tell him what's happened.

1440
01:49:54,369 --> 01:49:56,360
