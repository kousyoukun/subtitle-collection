00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,640

- Oh, Jonathan.
- Let's go. Have you got your car here?
- 噢，Jonathan。
- 我们走吧。你有开车来吗？

122
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,840

It's parked in front. I'll show you
to the back entrance and pick you up there.
它停在前面。我带你到后门就在能里接你。

123
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,040

Eve, do you hate me...
Eve，你恨我吗…

124
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,480

...now that you know
about Charlotte and me?
…你现在知道我和Charlotte的事？

125
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,280

Why, I could never hate you, Jonathan...
为什么，我不可能恨你的，Jonathan…

126
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,920

...because we're...
We're such old friends.
…因为我们是…
我们是老朋友。

127
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,920

And...
而且…

128
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,200

Well, just because.
唔，只有这原因。

129
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,000

But I do wish I'd taken lessons
on the second fiddle.
但我希望下次会学乖。

130
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,920

Good old Eve.
我的Eve。

131
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,320

Bring him in here.
带他进来。

132
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,440

It's warmer.
这里暖和些。

133
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,560

Do you think I behaved like a fool?
你觉得我是个傻瓜吗？

134
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,520

On the whole, I think so.
整体来说，我认为是。

135
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,440

I think your boyfriend
has behaved like a fool.
我觉得你男朋友是个傻瓜。

136
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,440

I have a strong premonition
that I'm going to behave like a fool.
我有不祥的预感我将会是个傻瓜。

137
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,480

- It's infectious.
- Do you mean you're going to help him?
- 这是会感染的。
- 你的意思是你会帮他？

138
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,080

Why not?
为什么不帮？

139
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,560

He's a friend of yours, isn't he?
他是你朋友，不是吗？

140
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,320

- Oh, yes.
- I see.
- 噢，是的。
- 我明白了。

141
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,160

More than a friend, eh?
不单是朋友，哦？

142
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,440

When I'm with him, I get a feeling
in here that... That's sort of...
跟他在一起，我这里有种感觉…是那种…

143
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,520

Yes. Well, we'll go
into the symptoms later.
是。好吧，我们晚些才讨论你这症状。

144
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,680

Meanwhile, I take it you're either
keen on him or still hungry.
目前，我就看成是有兴趣或是肚子饿吧。

145
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,840

I'm in love with him.
我爱上他了。

146
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,960

You've roped him, but he's not yet
broken to harness. Is that it?
你绑住他，但他还没有完全放开怀抱。是不是？

147
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,360

I wish Charlotte Inwood was in...
我希望Charlotte Inwood还在…

148
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,200

Oh, do you?
噢，真的？

149
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,920

I've seen her on the stage.
我在台上看见她。

150
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,440

She'd have made me laugh,
if I hadn't been strictly on my guard.
如果我不是认真的岗位上，她会让我笑出来。

151
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,000

Well, she couldn't make me laugh,
off or on the stage.
可是，她不能让我笑，不管在台上或台下。

152
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,800

I can't bear to sit by and see
what she's doing to Jonathan.
我真的忍不住看她怎样对Jonathan。

153
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,080

She's like an evil spirit.
Just look at him!
她就像个魔鬼。看看他！

154
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,440

Ruined, and by a woman.
被一个女人，害的多惨。

155
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,320

Now you want me to take the ruins
for a little cruise.
你现在想我带这被害人去流浪一下。

156
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,200

- Well, is that it?
- I thought you could take him...
- 哦，就是这样？
- 我以为你能带他…

157
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,640

...across the channel or to the Irish coast.
Then he could hide out a bit.
…穿过水道或是到爱尔兰海岸。
然后他可以躲一会。

158
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,760

The journey sounds attractive,
but less so...
这行程蛮吸引的，但好像是…

159
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,320

...to help a suspected murderer to escape,
particularly with my reputation.
…协助杀人嫌疑犯逃走，
尤其是以我的形象。

160
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,240

There's nothing wrong
with your reputation.
你的形象没什么问题。

161
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,960

Oh, indeed.
I rather flattered myself that there was.
噢，是吗。我也希望自己相信是这样。

162
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,880

As a matter of fact, the customs people
have their eye on me.
可是事实上，那些海关的人总盯着我。

163
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,040

I'm suspected of being a smuggler.
我被怀疑是走私客。

164
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,160

- Well, you're not.
- Oh, yes, I am.
- 可是，你不是。
- 噢，是，我是。

165
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,800

One cask of brandy?
That doesn't mean you're a smuggler.
一桶白兰地？这不代表你是走私客。

166
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,600

- Two casks.
- That was 15 years ago.
- 两桶。
- 那是15年前的事。

167
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,480

I've done one or two other things since
that I didn't tell you or your mother about.
我还干过一两次其他的只是没有告诉你或你母亲。

168
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,480

- Can't have been very much.
- Of course not. Not very much.
- 也不是什么大事。
- 但然不是。不是什么大事。

169
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,200

Nothing could appear very much
to a murderer's moll.
跟谋杀共犯比当然算不上是什么大事。

170
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,320

But I never hope to be appreciated.
但我也不会希望别人欣赏这些。

171
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,400

Yes, your mother cured me of that.
对，是你母亲把我治好的。

172
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,960

That's why I never could be bothered
with your mother.
所以我也不会麻烦你母亲。

173
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,720

I appreciate you, Father. You and
Captain Kidd are my favorite heroes.
我感谢你，爸爸。你和Kidd船长是我最爱的英雄。

174
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,400

My child, I am not deceived.
我的孩子，我不是误导你。

175
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,600

If there's one thing I cannot bear,
it's insincerity.
我最不能忍受的事，是不诚实。

176
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,640

But you've got to help him.
You will help him, won't you?
但你一定要帮他。你会帮他的，会吗？

177
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,600

He's lonely. He hasn't got any friends
but me, and maybe you.
你很寂寞。除了我可能还有你，他没有朋友。

178
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,800

- You will help him, won't you?
- He hasn't got me...
- 你会帮他的，会吗？
- 他没跟我…

179
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,240

...yet.
…还没。

180
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,800

You're just dying to get into a part of this,
and you know you are.
你求之不得参与此事，你自己也知道的。

181
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,440

A part in this melodramatic play,
you mean?
你是说，参与这夸张的戏剧性演出？

182
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,320

That's the way you're treating it, Eve.
你是这样看的，Eve。

183
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,160

As though it were a play
you were acting in at the Academy.
虽然这只是演戏，但你是在学院里演出啊。

184
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,040

Everything seems a fine acting role
when you're stage-struck...
只要你热爱演出各方面看这都是个好角色…

185
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,880

...doesn't it, my dear?
…不是吗，亲爱的？

186
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,360

Here you have a plot,
an interesting cast...
这是你的剧本，非常有趣的角色…

187
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,320

...even a costume,
little the worse for wear.
…还有戏服，有点忙不过来。

188
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,920

Unfortunately, Eve,
in this real and earnest life...
非常不幸，Eve，在这现实的生活中…

189
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,440

...we must face the situation
and all its bearings.
…我们必须面对这种情况和成担。

190
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,320

Yes.
对。

191
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,200

What do you mean?
你是什么意思？

192
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,440

Well, Miss Charlotte Inwood
appears to be an expert in garden paths.
这样，Charlotte Inwood小姐
好像是公园小径的专家。

193
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,520

I think she's led your young friend
up the garden path.
我想她带你的年青朋友去公园小径。

194
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,960

I think we should hesitate
before we follow him.
我想我们应该考虑清楚才跟他走。

195
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,120

- But why?
- I don't know how this bloodstain...
- 但为什么？
- 我不知道这血迹怎会…

196
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,200

...got onto this dress, but I do know that
somebody smeared it on deliberately.
…沾在这裙子上，但我知道是有人故意擦上去。

197
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,800

But why should they do that?
但是他们为什么要这样做？

198
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,280

Well, Miss Inwood is an actress,
a very good one.
唔，Inwood小姐是演员，一个有名的演员。

199
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,640

She has an eye
for an emotional situation.
她的感情状况很多人关注。

200
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,920

Supposing she wanted our somnolent
young friend to go to her house...
假如她想她的秘密年青朋友去她家…

201
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,440

...and be spotted there.
…被发现了。

202
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,400

Well, this sanguinary garment
would provide a very plausible reason.
这染血的衣服提供了一个非常有说服力的原因。

203
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,960

A very plausible reason indeed.
确实是个非常有说服力的原因。

204
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,440

So that's why she didn't change her dress
before she went to his rooms.
这就是为什么她过来前不把裙子换掉。

205
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,560

Well, I cannot imagine Miss Inwood
going to see her young man...
我不能假设Inwood小姐会去见她那小伙子。

206
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,080

Or your young man, whose ever young man
he is, in this nasty, messy condition.
或你那小伙子，不管他是谁的小伙子，
在这坏透，又混乱的情况下。

207
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,840

No. This dress is a clue, my dear,
a very important clue.
不。这裙子是线索，亲爱的，是个重要线索。

208
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,920

And though it grieves me, of all people,
to have to say it, Eve...
虽然这让我很难过，所有人，也会这样说，Eve…

209
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,400

...I think we should go to the police.
…我想我们一定要去找警察。

210
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,240

Jonathan! Jonathan, wake up.
Jonathan！Jonathan，起来。

211
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,920

Jonathan, how far do you think
you could trust Charlotte?
Jonathan，你想你能相信Charlotte到那程度？

212
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,280

I'd trust her with my life.
What do you mean?
我可以把性命交给她。你是什么意思？

213
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,800

This bloodstain was put here deliberately.
这血迹是有意弄上去的。

214
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,520

Don't be ridiculous. You're trying to turn me
against Charlotte, but you can't.
别荒谬。你想要我指正Charlotte，不可能。

215
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,000

What's this doing here, anyhow?
It should have been destroyed hours ago!
留着这东西还有什么用？
应该一早就把它毁灭！

216
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,560

Fool! There goes the evidence
that could've helped you.
笨蛋！这里有证据可能会帮到你。

217
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,760

I'm doing all this for Charlotte's sake.
You're just jealous of her!
我做这一切都是为了Charlotte。你只是嫉妒她！

218
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,200

Young man, I'd remind you
you're my daughter's guest.
年青人，我要提醒你，你是我女儿的客人。

219
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,840

I'd like better manners from you.
我觉得你的态度应该好些。

220
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,800

Oh, I am sorry, Eve.
噢，对不起，Eve。

221
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,720

Please forgive me.
请原谅我。

222
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,080

I lost my head for a moment.
我一时失态了。

223
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,560

I can hardly think.
I'm almost dead for want of sleep.
我很难想象。为了睡一觉我差点死了。

224
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,600

I wonder, would it be too much trouble
if I went to bed?
好奇怪，我去睡觉是不是会带来很大麻烦？

225
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,720

That is, if Commodore Gill
wants to let me stay.
会的，如果Gill指挥官要我留下。

226
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,120

Your room is at the head of the stairs.
You'll be quite comfortable.
你的房间在楼梯的尽头。你会挺舒服的。

227
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,160

And if you want anything to read in bed...
如果你想睡前看书…

228
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,000

...you'll find some quite good
murder mysteries in there.
…你会在那找到些挺好的谋杀小说。

229
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,840

Beg your pardon.
你说什么。

230
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,800

Look, Eve...
你看，Eve…

231
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,640

But he's just gone...
但他刚走…

232
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,480

At last we are alone and unobserved.
You know, I'm beginning to enjoy this.
起码没人还有没被发现。
你知道吗，我开始有点喜欢这样。

233
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,600

Father, do you think she arranged
to put the suspicion on Jonathan?
爸，你认为是她安排让Jonathan受嫌疑的吗？

234
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,120

- Do you think she deliberately framed him?
- The thought had crossed my mind.
- 你认为是她故意陷害他吗？
- 我总是这样想。

235
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,120

That was why I reluctantly suggested that
our friends, the police, ought to be told.
所以我不愿意提议我们的朋友，应该告诉警察。

236
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,000

But it's too late. Our only evidence
has gone up the chimney.
但现在太晚了。我们唯一的证据已经烧掉。

237
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,400

But we must help him.
He'll do nothing for himself.
但我们一定要帮他。你不会为自己做任何事。

238
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,800

He's hopelessly in love with that woman.
It's up to us.
他已经无可救药的迷恋那女人。只有靠我们了。

239
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,480

Yes, but it won't be easy.
对，但不会容易。

240
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,880

It is easy.
I'll go to her and see her myself.
很容易。我会亲自去见她。

241
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,480

- Would that be wise?
- But I don't care if it is or not.
- 这样做是明智吗？
- 但我不管是不是？

242
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,960

I'll tell her we know how the bloodstain got
on the dress and every move of her game.
我会告诉她我们知道那血迹怎会在裙子上
和她那游戏的每一步。

243
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,000

I'll make her talk.
It'll be one woman to another.
我会逼她说出来。这是两个女人之间的事。

244
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,080

An impressive situation at any time.
任何时候这都是精彩的状况。

245

She won't be able to help
but give herself away. You'll see.
她将会无计可施只有交待。你看着吧。

246
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,080

I won't see. I won't be there,
and neither will you.
我看不到。我不会在那，你也不可以。

247
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,720

If we're right in what we think,
she's a dangerous woman.
如果我们所想的是对的，她是个危险的女人。

248
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,360

She won't give herself away.
You'd be giving her an alternative.
她不会交待。你会给她另一选择。

249
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,760

She has no alternative.
她没有别的选择。

250
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,120

She might murder you.

251
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,280

Oh, don't be so melodramatic, Father.

252
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,080

Look, my love. Face facts.
看清楚，亲爱的。面对事实。

253
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,720

What is the least that can happen to you
if you tackle this remarkable lady?
如果你去接触这厉害的女士，
你最幸运会是怎样？

254
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,360

She'll at once pick up a little pink
telephone and call the police.
她会马上拿起那粉红色的小电话去找警察。

255
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,320

She will then give you in charge
for concealing a fugitive from justice.
她会告发你隐藏逃犯。

256
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,880

Eventually, you will be tried
at the Old Bailey.
最后，你会在Old Bailey被审问。

257
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,880

Well, if you're lucky, you might get off
with, now, let me see...
嗯，如果你幸运，你会脱罪，现在，让我想想…

258
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,400

...a couple of years, which you will spend
in Holloway prison...
…几年吧，你会在Holloway监狱度过…

259
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,280

...meditating on the folly of transmuting
melodrama into real life.
…理性的想想把愚蠢的戏剧情节回到现实。

260
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,600

Well...
嗯…

261
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,960

The best thing you can do, my girl,
is to go back to your Academy...
我的小女孩，现在最好是先回你的学院去…

262
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,040

...and practice your soul-shaking antics...
…表现你那激动的举止…

263
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,800

...in surroundings where
they can't do any harm.
…在公众场所他们不能伤害你。

264
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,560

After all, this fellow can't possibly
mean all that to you.
不管怎样，这小伙子不可能是你的一切。

265
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,720

But he does, Father.
但他是，爸爸。

266
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,840

- Move along, please.
- But I'd like...
- 请你去吧。
- 但我想…

267
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,360

Now move along, ma'am.
This is nothing to see.
马上去吧，大姐。没什么好看。

268
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,480

Hello, Father?
I'm outside the Inwood house.
喂，爸爸？我在Inwood家外面。

269
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,600

Outside? Why not inside?
在外面？为什么不进去？

270
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,960

Don't be ridiculous, Father.
The police won't let anyone near the place.
不要荒谬吧，爸爸。警察不会让任何人接近。

271
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,360

Really? How very extraordinary.
是吗？真不寻常。

272
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,560

Look, you've done your best.
Come back here...
看，你已经尽力了。回来吧…

273
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,200

...and decide about the man
that came to dinner.
…为昨晚来吃饭那人再想想。

274
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,280

Oh, I feel awful. I've been listening
to the people in the crowd talking...
噢，我觉得很难受。我听见人们在说…

275
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,480

...and they assume that
you-know-who is guilty...
…你知道他们认定谁是有罪…

276
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,760

...and all the police have to do
is catch him. It's terrifying.
…而所有警察都要抓他。真可怕。

277
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,920

Yes, but the police may not
think he's guilty.
是，但警察不一定认为他有罪。

278
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,000

After all, they work in secret, you know.
不管怎样，他们是秘密行事，你也知道。

279
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,080

They may have their own ideas
about a certain lady.
他们可能对某女士有些想法。

280
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,760

I wish I knew what
the police were thinking.
我希望我知道警察在想什么。

281
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,000

- Well, look, why not ask them?
- Well, that's easier said than done.
- 嗯，为什么不问他们？
- 唔，说比做容易。

282
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,040

Oh, just a minute, Father.
噢，等一下，爸爸。

283
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,080

- Father, goodbye now.
- Eve...
- 爸爸，就这样吧。
- Eve…

284
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,400

I'll see you back at the office
about 2:00, sir.
将官，我2:00左右回办公室，到时见。

00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,440

May I have a small brandy, please?
可以给我一小杯白兰地，好吗？

286
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,640

Madam. Pardon my intrusion,
but is there, by any chance...
太太。打扰了，但有没有机会，有什么…

287
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,640

...any assistance I could be of?
- No, thank you.
…我能帮上忙？
- 不用了，谢谢。

- Oh, I get around.
- 我不明白你在那沾上那么多灰尘。

289
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,400

Any case, I know Munson's...

290
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,240

Right from the horse's mouth.

291
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,960

I most solemnly assure you, madam...
我极小的这样保证，太太…

292
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,560

...it would be a pleasure, if there was
any assistance I could be of.

293
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,960

Thank you very much.

294
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,520

If you will allow me to say so,
you look depressed.
请容许我这样说，你好像很不开心。

Yes, the cheering word,
the helping hand...

I'm perfectly all right.

Is there anything I can do?
我可以为你做什么吗？

299

Look, I don't know your trouble,
but you don't look very well to me.
你看，我不知道你有什么麻烦，
但你看来不是很好。

300
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,240

A little brandy can't do you any harm.
Why not drink it?
一小杯白兰地不会对你有害。为什么不喝？

301
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,240

My great-aunt died over a glass of brandy,
but it was her 15th that day.
我的曾姨妈喝了一杯白兰地就死了，
不过那是她那天的第15杯。

- Yes, thank you.

You left your lunch over there.

它会感到孤单。我等一下就回去。

305
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,640

Perhaps you're allergic to bars.
Look...
或许你对酒吧敏感。你看…

306
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,240

...would you feel less uneasy
if I sat with you, or more so?
…如果我陪你伤心或比你更伤心，
你会不会感觉好点？

307
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,480

- Perhaps you're allergic to strange men too.
- No. I love strange men.
- 或许你对陌生男人也敏感吧。
- 不。我爱陌生男人。

- 我的意思是，我很喜欢他们。
- 我还是去拿我的午餐。

The butler told me. Never saw such a sight.
They say his head was bashed in.
那管家告诉我。不要看这种事。
他们说他的头受重击。

310
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,480

I heard they clocked him so hard his
false teeth went across the room.
我听说他们太用力打他连他的假牙都打掉。

311
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,880

I know I'm pretty silly, but I overheard
two people on the street today...
我知道我挺笨的，

...talking about the murder.

313
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,520

They went into a lot of detail.
他们说到很多细节。

314
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,160

I felt so sick and giddy,
I just had to come in and have a brandy.
我觉得很不舒服又晕，我需要进来喝杯白兰地。

315
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,880

My father says I tend
to overdramatize everything.
我爸说我把什么都想得太戏剧性。

316
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,360

I expect he's right. I know how you feel,
though. I hate violence myself.
我想他是对的。需然我知道你怎样想。
我个人是讨厌暴力。

317
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,280

Doesn't that make it
rather difficult for you?
这会让你很为难吗？

318
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,960

I mean, I think we ought to face up
to the ugly side of life.
我的意思是，我们必须面对人生丑恶的一面。

319
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,200

Now, me, for instance.
I'm an actress.
现在，比方说，我。我是个演员。

320
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,480

I ought to face up to all sorts
of experiences, oughtn't I?
我必须面对各种的经验，不是吗？

321
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,400

Oh, I don't know. Supposing I happened
to be a librarian.
噢，我不知道。比如说我是个图书馆职员。

322
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,800

A librarian doesn't encounter much violence
except an occasional encyclopedia falling.
一个图书馆职员不会面对太多暴力
只是偶尔会有百科全书掉下。

323
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,120

But you're not a librarian, are you?

No, I'm not. How do you know?

Well, you just don't
look like a librarian.
唔，你就是不像个图书馆职员

- Oh? I thought I did.
- 你不像个演员。
- 哦？我以为我想。

327
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,640

Well, I'm only a beginner, really.
That is, I've only played one part in public.
唔，我只是个初哥，真的。
就是说，我只公开演出过一次。

328
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,360

- Could I have seen you?
- I don't think so.
- 我曾经见过你吗？
- 应该没有。

00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,320

It was in the church hall.
I played the fourth deadly sin.
在教堂里。我演出第四种死罪。

- 我就想死尸。

331
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,600

What was this Jonathan Cooper after?
这个Jonathan Cooper想要什么？

- Perhaps he did it for the fun of it...
- 我听说没有东西被偷。

333
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,080

Poor Charlotte Inwood.
可怜的Charlotte Inwood。

334

Imagine coming home and finding
your husband horribly dead...
想像一下回家发现自己丈夫可怕的死去…

335
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,840

...policemen and detectives
all over the house, and the blood...
…满屋子都是警察和侦探，还有血…

336
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,200

Careful, careful.
小心，小心。

337
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,560

Remember, you're sensitive to that sort
of thing. You'll bring on another fainting fit.
记住，你对这些事挺敏感的。你会再次昏倒。

338
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,160

I hear that Charlotte Inwood's going back
into the show in a couple of days.

still burning in one's mind.
…尤其是那可怕的阴影还在脑海。

341
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,400

Oh, it's the old story, "Is not the actor
the man with a heart?" all over again.
噢，是个旧故事，
“不是演员他是有心人？”再重演。

342
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,800

I once had a cousin
who had a duodenal ulcer...
我有个外甥他患了十二指肠溃疡…

...and an extremely funny face,
both at the same time.

Everybody laughed
when he was telling his symptoms.

346
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,120

That must have been terrible.

Oh, I don't know.
Jim's quite a common name.
噢，我不知道。Jim是个很普通的名字。

我在想Charlotte Inwood是什么毛样的。

- That's Charlotte Inwood's maid.
- 噢，你好，Nellie。
- 她是Charlotte Inwood的佣人。

to see you so soon.

How are you bearing up after last night?

00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,680

- Not too much lemon, dear.
- Okay.
- 不要太多柠檬，亲爱的。
- OK。

358
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,560

Mind you, they never laid a finger on me,
but, oh, the questions. Nag, nag, nag.
提醒你，他们没碰我，但是，
噢，那些问题。别，别，别。

359
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,040

"How did you know it was Mr. Cooper?
How many times you seen him and where?
“你怎样知道是Cooper先生？
你见过他多少次在那？

360
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,160

And did he give you anything?"
Blimey, he never gave me nothing.
还有他有给你什么吗？”
Blimey，他从来也没有给我什么。

361
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,120

"And how long you been
Miss Inwood's maid?"
“你当Inwood小姐的佣人有多久？”

362
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,360

They was gentlemanly and polite,
all right...
他们很有礼又有礼貌，好吗…

363
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,840

...but give me the bleeding Russians
any day, dear.
…但每天给我那可恨的苏联人，亲爱的。

364
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,840

Yes. You gotta watch your step
when you're up against the police.
对。当我们要对付警察时你要小心奕点。

365
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,400

If that wasn't enough,
when I came out of the house...
如果当我离开房子，那还不够…

366
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,880

...the reporters pounced on me with their
questions, asking me the lowdown.
…记者们会跳出来提问，问我些尖锐的。

367
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,120

I just jumped out of my skin when that
photographer's flashbulb went.
那摄影师的闪光灯刚把我吓了一跳。

368
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,800

Well, I mean, fancy taking my picture.
唔，我的意思是，未经同意给我拍照。

369
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,240

You're quite a celebrity, you lucky girl.
I'll have to buy the Daily Mirror tomorrow.
你应该庆祝，幸运的小姑娘。
我明天一定要买<i>每日镜报</i>

370
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,240

Of course, I'm not saying a word
to the reporters. Not a word.
当然，我对记者什么也没说。一个字也没有。

371
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,760

After all, who discovered the body?
说到底，谁发现尸体？

372
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,560

I'll be a star witness at that trial, and my
story ought to be worth something...
在审讯中我将会是个名星证人，
我的故事应该有些价值…

373
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,880

...and I've no intention of giving it away.
…而且我没打算放弃。

374
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,480

- Isn't she talking too much?
- Too much, too loud, too everything.
- 她是否说得太多？
- 太多，太吵，什么都太多。

375
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,440

How do you feel now?
你现在感觉怎样？

376
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,920

Oh, I feel a little better, thank you.
噢，我感觉好点了，谢谢。

377
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,480

I have to go.
我要走了。

378
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,240

I don't like leaving you here alone.
我不想剩下你一个人在这。

379
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,400

Do you feel fit enough
to let me see you home?
我去你家见你你觉得合适吗？

380
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,480

- I have a car.
- Perhaps you'd better let me drive it for you.
- 我有开车来。
- 或许让我替你开车会好点。

381
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,000

Well, that's very kind of you.
I do still feel a bit wobbly.
唔，你真好人。我真的还觉得有点发抖。

382
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,920

To be quite honest, it isn't kindness at all.
I mean, I'm afraid I maneuvered it.
老实说，这不是什么好。
我的意思是，我怕我令到你这样。

383
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,280

How clever of you.
你真聪明。

384
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,640

You've got something there, Fred.
I'll drink to that, on you.
Fred你有些东西在那。我会喝了它，为了你。

385
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,080

A double gin and lemon, please.
双份的gin酒加柠檬，麻烦你。

386
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,880

Double? All right, Nellie,
I hope it chokes you.
双份？好吧，Nellie，希望把你呛到。

387
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,320

You don't miss a trick, do you?
You're always on the make.
你不会放过任何机会损人，是不是？?
你常常这样做。

388
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,840

My mother's really a dear. My father, too,
but they shout at one another...
我母亲很可爱。
我父亲，一样可爱，但他们常对骂…

389
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,720

...and neither one like to shout.
…可是他们都不喜欢吵架。

390
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,840

I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this.
我说不出我是多么感谢。

391
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,280

You've been extraordinarily kind and
you know nothing whatsoever about me.
你实在是太好了而年根本不了解我。

392
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,440

Oh, I don't know, Miss Gill.
噢，我不知道，Gill小姐。

393
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,400

You were born in South Africa.
The 17th of September, wasn't it?
你在南非出生。9月17号，是不是？

394
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,000

Educated in America and you're studying
at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.
在美国受教育是在皇家戏剧学院。

395
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,760

Your parents don't live together.
你双亲住在一起。

396
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,680

You're a very well-behaved lady, but allergic
to murder, and that drove you to drink.
你是个很有礼貌的淑女，
但对谋杀敏感，使你喝酒。

397
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,040

I hope it's only temporary.
希望是暂时性的。

398
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,360

But I don't even know your name.

I only know that you play the piano.

400
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,000

I'm so sorry. It was stupid of me.
I forgot. My name is Smith.
对不起。我太苯了。我忘了。我叫Smith。

401
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,680

Just ordinary Smith?
只是普通的Smith？

402
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,720

A detective?
是侦探？

403
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,880

I hope you don't mind.

404
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,560

Oh, no. Of course not.

405
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,440

Well, I'm delighted.
嗯，我很欣慰。

406
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,200

By the way, I don't suppose you and
your mother are interested in tea...
说回来，我想你和你母亲想喝点茶…

407
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,640

...with a detective, that is.
…跟一个侦探，这是。

408
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,960

Of course. Especially with a detective.
当然。尤其是侦探。

409
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,840

- Would you like to have tea with us?
- Oh, I'd love to. How about this afternoon?
- 你想跟我们喝杯茶吗？
- 噢，我非常愿意。这个下午好吗？

410
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,560

- Well, tomorrow, then?
- Yes.
- 那，明天吧？
- 好。

411
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,080

Yes. That's fine.
好。可以。

412
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,480

And I could take your place.
我可以去你哪里。

413
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,880

You'd never get away with it. What
makes you think you could be a maid?
你永远忘不了。什么让你想成为女佣？

414
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,560

It would only be for a day or two.
只是一两天。

415
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,960

You'd have to be her dresser
down at the theater.
你本来是她在剧院的服装师。

416
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,880

You couldn't do that.
That's very highly skilled work.
你不能做那些。那是很尊业的工作。

417
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,600

- Well, I could if you told me how.
- It sounds phony to me.
- 哦，如果你教我我是可以的。
- 听起来好像很虚伪。

418
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,440

All this trouble just to get
a newspaper story.
这些麻烦只不过是要上报。

419
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,600

Well, we women reporters have
a tough job competing with the men...
嗯，做女记者在男人堆里是件艰苦的工作…

420
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,800

...especially on
important stories like this.

And what paper are you on, may I ask?

422
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,440

Well, I can't tell you that.
嗯，我不能告诉你。

423
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,760

If anything should go wrong,
it would be embarrassing for the paper.
如果有什么差错，会让报社尴尬。

424
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,640

Oh? And what about my job?
噢？那我的工作呢？

425
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,800

Suppose Miss Inwood found out
I was passing you off as my cousin.
如果Inwood小姐知道我因为外甥而透露资料。

426
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,640

I'm not sure she won't smell a rat.
我不能肯定她不会发现。

427
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,440

I never been away ill for years.
我没试过请几年病假。

428
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,800

But anyone could go sick.
And I could do it, really I could.
但每个人都会病。而且我会这样做，真的会。

429
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,560

I've... I've done a bit of acting.
我…我也演过一点戏。

430
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,560

Character acting?
演角色？

431
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,680

- Yes.
- I see.
- 是。
- 我明白了。

432
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,680

All you gotta do is put on some old clothes
and make yourself look common like me.
你要做的只是穿上些旧衣服像我一样普通。

433
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,200

Let me explain why it's so important
that I get the right slant on this.
让我解释为什么我要冒这个险。

434
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,800

I think there's a romance between
Miss Inwood and this man named Cooper.
我想Inwood小姐跟那个叫Cooper的男人有恋情。

435
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,800

And where did you get this idea?
Do you know what I think?
你凭什么有这想法？
你知道我怎样想？

436
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,240

- I think you're snooping for the police.
- Oh, no...
- 我想你是替警察做监视。
- 噢，不…

437
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,440

I saw you this morning sitting
on this very seat with a detective.
今天早上我看见你跟一个侦探坐在这。

438
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,960

Oh, well, that was Wilfred Smith.
噢，是，那是Wilfred Smith。

439
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,320

He's an old friend of mine.
I didn't get a thing out of him.
他是我一个老朋友。我在他身上什么也没得到。

440
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,440

Charlie, double gin and lemon, please.
Charlie，双份gin酒加柠檬，麻烦你。

441
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,640

- Not too much lemon, dear.
- Same for me.
- 不要太多柠檬，亲爱的。
- 我也一样。

442
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,040

I can get five times that much
from any newspaper when the case is over.
当这案子完了我可以在报社拿到多五倍的。

443
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,040

Why not get both?
为什么不两边都要？

444
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,520

Caught you, have I?
抓到你了，有没有？

445
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,080

Hope I don't intrude
on some deep conspiracy.
但愿我不会被迫卷入大阴谋中。

446
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,000

And I hope you find yourself no worse
for your distressing experiences.
我也希望你会发现你的顾虑是多余的。

447
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,480

Haven't I met your charming
friend before? I know that face.
我有见过你这漂亮的朋友吗？我觉得很面善。

448
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,880

This is my cousin Doris, Mr. Fortesque.
这是我外甥Doris，Fortesque先生。

449
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,400

Oh, yeah. Charming. Charming.
噢，是啊。漂亮。漂亮。

450
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,400

Perhaps as dear Nellie didn't
provide me with your surname...
或许亲爱的Nellie没有告诉我你姓什么…

451
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,920

...you'll let me call you Doris, eh?
…你可以告诉我Doris，嗯？

452
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,520

Mrs. Mason, I can't think what I've done
with my reading glasses.
Mason小姐，我想不到我的眼镜放那。

453
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,480

Have you seen them anywhere?

Help me find my glasses, Eve, darling.
I can't see a thing.
替我找一下我的眼镜，Eve，亲爱的。

I'm Doris Tinsdale.

Just wait over here a minute.

Oh, how stupid people are.

Even if my understudy's legs
are so peculiar...

夫人知道我会来。

477
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,160

The new girl's here, Charlie.
新来的女孩到了，Charlie。

478
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,240

No, no. This doesn't fit me.
不，不。这个我不合适。

479
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,600

Here, here. Pull it up on this side.
The other side too.
这里，这里。在这边拉高。那边也一样。

480
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,840

You know that, don't you?
你知道的，是不是？

481
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,760

Excuse me, madam.
对不起，夫人。

482
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,160

Read it to me, dear.
读给我听，亲爱的。

483
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,880

"Dear Madam, this will introduce
my cousin Doris...
“亲爱的夫人，这是介绍我外甥Doris…

484
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,640

...who is in every way a good girl."
…她是各方面都很好的女孩。”

485
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,920

Not so loud.
不要太大声。

486
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,800

"I hope you'll find her satisfactory
during my illness. Signed, Nellie Goode."
“在我生病期间我希望你对她满意。
Nellie Goode签字。”

487
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,880

This is very nice,
if you can call mourning nice...
这非常好，如果你早上先打电话来…

488
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,320

...but isn't there some way we could let it
plunge a little in front? I suppose not.
…但不是可以预先通知？我认为不应该。

489
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,960

"Signed, Nellie Goode."
“Nellie Goode签字”

490
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,240

If we could only work in a little
color somewhere. Oh, well.
我希望我们可以在那里加点色彩。噢，好吧。

491
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,720

"Signed, Nellie Goode."
“Nellie Goode签字”

492
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,640

Take off your hat, dear.
把帽子脱下，亲爱的。

493
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,360

There are simply millions
of things to do, I'm afraid.
恐怕，这里有很多事等着要做。

494
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,760

You won't mind if I depend
on you a great deal?
如果我对你非常依赖你不会介意吧？

495
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,640

Thank you, darling.
谢谢你，打令。

496
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,240

Now, get me out of these weeds.
I'm beginning to feel sad, and I shouldn't.
现在，替我把这些拿掉。
我开始觉得不开心，但我不能。

497
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,640

It's so depressing.
真让人伤心。

498
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,840

See who that is.
看看那是谁。

499
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,880

What's your name?
你叫什么名子？

500
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,680

Doris Tinsdale, madam.
Doris Tinsdale，夫人。

501
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,040

Yes? What is it, Groves?
是？什么事，Groves？

502
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,040

Divisional Detective Inspector Byard...
分区探长Byard…

503
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,480

...and Detective Inspector Smith
to see you, madam.
…和Smith探长要见你，夫人。

504
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,080

Good heavens.
我的天。

505
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,400

Hear that, Freddie? The police again.
你听到吗，Freddie？又是警察。

506
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,080

- Show them up, Groves.
- Very good, madam.
- 带他们进来，Grovers。
- 是的，夫人。

507
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,200

I thought I told you to wait downstairs.
我告诉你们在楼下等的。

508
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,840

Hand me a negligee from that cupboard
over there, will you, Phyllis?
在那衣柜里拿件外套给我，好吗，Phyllis？

509
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,600

Now, what about this dress for
the theatrical garden party, Miss Inwood?
现在，穿这裙子去戏院的园游会，
好吗InWood小姐？

510
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,080

Black? Oh, yes, of course.
黑色？噢，好，当然好。

511
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,320

How clever of you to remember, darling.
你真聪明还记得，打令。

512
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,600

Hold that for me, will you?
替我拿住，好吗？

513
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,440

- Freddie.
- Yes?
- Freddie。
- 什么？

514
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,520

We haven't decided. Am I going
to the theatrical garden party?
我们还没决定。我要不要去那剧院的园游会？

515
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,400

I don't feel an atom like it.
我不觉得我属于哪里。

516
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,200

I keep thinking about those
dreadful cancellations.
我不断的想起那取消演出。

517
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,320

I don't see why.
They're a compliment to you.
我看不出为什么。他们是你的恭维。

518
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,080

Hand me a comb and mirror
from over there, will you?
把梳子跟镜子那过来给我，好吗？

519
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,520

But they do cut down the takings.
但他们是取消了问话。

520
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,240

I think I could appear tonight,
if you insisted.
我像今晚我可以出现，如果你坚持的话。

521
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,240

Wouldn't it be a terrible strain for you?
那不是给你很大压力吗？

522
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,640

Oh, ghastly.
噢，真惊讶。

523
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,280

But I can't help feel
for my poor, dear, loyal public.
但我控制不了我那些，亲爱的，忠实的大众。

524
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,560

Looking towards it for weeks...
再等几周看看…

525
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,040

...and then trailing back sadly
with their tickets...
…然后用他们的戏票去回想这难过的情况…

526
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,480

...getting their money returned.
I simply can't bear it.
…用他们的钱来赔偿这一切。
我只是受不了。

527
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,440

It would be pretty trying.
这是值得尝试的。

528
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,560

Waves of sympathy coming on the stage...
同情的力量是来自舞台…

529
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,960

...all the gangways flooded with tears.
…每个观众都在哭。

530
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,160

I can hardly bear the thought myself.
我自己也忍不住要去想。

531
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,480

No use trying to stop me.
I'm going on tonight.
想停止我是没用的。我今晚会去。

532
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,560

Be at the theater at 6:00 sharp, will you?
你准时六点到剧院，好吗？

533
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,480

- Yes, madam.
- Take this away.
- 是，夫人。
- 走这边。

534
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,600

You go right ahead, dear.
Garden party dress and everything.
你太早了，亲爱的。
园游会的服装和其他的还没好。

535
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,680

And why don't we let ourselves
go a trifle just in front, huh?
那为什么不让我们先去办要事，嘿？

536
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,320

And thank you so very much.
那非常感谢你了。

537
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,560

What do you suppose
the police wants now?
你以为警察想要什么？

538
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,920

I don't know.
我不知道。

539
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,920

Must you speak to me
with your mouth full?
你一定要塞满嘴巴才跟我说话吗？

540
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,080

They've probably come to look under
your bed for Master Cooper.
他们可能会在你床底下去找Cooper先生。

541
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,920

What could I tell them about Cooper?
I know nothing about him.
我可以告诉他们Cooper什么？我对他一无所知。

542
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,720

Tell them just that.
就告诉他们这个。

543
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,600

Listen.
听着。

544
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,080

That's a good idea.
有个好提议。

545
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,680

Elsie, darling, come here.
Elsie，亲爱的，过来。

546
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,360

Now, I want you to wait
in the other room and listen.
现在，我想你去另一个房间等并留心听。

547
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,600

When you hear me cough, you come
in and say, "The doctor's here."
当你听到我咳嗽，你进来说，“医生来了。”

548
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,960

Yes, madam.
是，夫人。

549
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,920

You can stand just so much of detectives.
你对侦探的忍耐力真强。

550
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,400

After all, they are only policemen
with smaller feet.
说到底，他们只是警察里的小角色。

551
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,280

- In here?
- The next door, sir.
- 在这里？
- 另一道门，先生

552
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,040

What's the matter with Nellie?
Nellie有什么问题？

553
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,640

Oh, it's her stomach, sir,
if you'll excuse the expression.
噢，是她的胃，先生，如果没事我先告退。

554
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,080

The tragedy and excitement
was too much for her.
她经历的悲惨和刺激太多了。

555
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,600

- Highly strung type, eh?
- Oh, very, sir.
- 敏感脆弱型，嗯？
- 噢，是非常，先生。

556
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,000

I suppose you know, Miss Inwood,
that whatever Cooper's motive was...
我想你认识，Inwood小姐，
不管Cooper的动机为何…

557
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,200

...it certainly couldn't have been robbery.
…肯定不会是行劫。

558
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,760

Of course, darling. I understand that.
当然，亲爱的。这个我明白。

559
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,840

I suppose he just tried
to make it look like robbery.
我认为他只想造成像是行劫。

560
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,000

What's your name again?
再问一次你的名字是？

561
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,640

- Doris, sir.
- You know, Doris, you're not bad-looking.
- Doris，先生。
- 你知道吗，Doris，你不难看。

562
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,800

- Thank you, sir.
- You don't treat your face properly.
- 谢谢你，先生。
- 你没有好好打扮。

563
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,000

If you fixed your hair and used makeup,
you'd be quite attractive.
如果你弄一下头发和化点妆，你是挺有吸引力的。

564
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,920

I suppose I shouldn't have seen him
as often as I did.
我还以为我应该不会经常见到他。

565
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,520

But I didn't realize how madly
infatuated he was with me.
但我没有发现他对我是那么疯狂的着迷。

566
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,880

I just didn't realize.
我就是没有发现。

567
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,920

You'll never know how much
I blame myself for all this.
你永远不会知道为了这事有多么的责怪自己。

568
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,440

When my husband came back
from New York last week...
当我丈夫从上星期纽约回来…

569
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,480

...and I told Jonnie I couldn't see him...
…我告诉Jonnie我不能见他…

570
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,120

...he kept on phoning me.
…他不断打电话给我。

571
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,040

He wouldn't let me alone.
他不让我安静。

572
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,440

Oh, maybe if I had agreed to see him...
噢，或许我答应见他…

573
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,600

...he wouldn't have done
this dreadful thing.
…他不会做出这可怕的事。

574
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,760

- When did you last see Jonathan Cooper?
- Let me think.
- 你最后是什么时候见过Jonathan Cooper？
- 让我想想。

575
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,280

It must have been a week...

576
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,360

A week before my husband died.
我丈夫去世前有一个礼拜。

577
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,720

- Go on. What are you waiting for?
- Did he come to this house?
- 继续。你在等什么？
- 他是来这房子吗？

578
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,760

Excuse me, madam.
The doctor's waiting to see you.
打扰一下，夫人。医生在等你。

579
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,720

Oh, I'm so sorry, darling,
but I will have to see my doctor.
噢，对不起，亲爱的，我要去见我的医生。

580
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,560

I'm feeling wretched.
I've been trying to get him all morning.
我觉得不舒服。我整个早上都在找他。

581
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,880

You see, I'm going on tonight.
你要明白，今晚我还要继续。

582
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,080

The producer has insisted so much.
那监制坚持要。

583
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,360

And I don't want to see him
ruined because of me.
我不想他因为我而搞砸。

584
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,120

That's all right. I think
we've covered most of the points.
没问题。我想我们已经差不多完了。

585
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,160

If there's any more I can help you with,
you will let me know?
如果还有其他可以帮助你们，请你告诉我？

586
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,920

Thank you. We'll try not
to trouble you again.

00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,560

You're so understanding.

Doris, show the gentlemen out.
Doris，带这位先生出去。

591
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,960

It's all right, thank you. We can
find our own way downstairs.
不用了，谢谢你。我们知道怎样下楼。

592
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,440

Freddie.
Freddie。

593
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,880

Mavis, go to the kitchen
and get yourself some tea.
Mavis，你去厨房自己倒点茶喝吧。

594
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,040

- I'll ring when I need you.
- Yes. Thank you, madam.
- 需要你我会按铃。
- 是。谢谢你，夫人。

595
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,280

- Darling, where is Jonathan?
- Friends may be hiding him.
- 打令，Jonathan在那？
- 可能是朋友把他藏起来。

596
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,680

He had no friends, only me.
他没有朋友，除了我。

597
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,880

I hope he hasn't made any and hasn't
taken them into his confidence.
我希望他交不到朋友或是对他们没有信心。

598
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,840

For your sake, his sake and their sake.
为了你，为了他和他们都是好事。

599
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,880

- What do you mean?
- Lf the truth comes out, it would break you.
- 你是什么意思？
- 如果水落石出，你会受不了。

600
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,880

- I can't have that.
- What could you do?
- 我不能那样。
- 你可以怎样做？

601

她跟我学的。她爸爸也不守时。

It's dangerous.

你不应该来这里，Jonnie。
你一直都做得很好直到现在。

You talk as though this were a favor.

can take care of.
是些说句“谢谢”就可以解决的。

when the run of the show's over.
当这次演出的期满，我会去看你。

为什么，将要几个月，可能是一年，或更长。

744
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:47,440

Well, you know how it is. We were
playing to capacity before this happened.
唔，你也知道是怎样。

Now they're hanging on to the chandeliers.

South America or somewhere.
我们可以找个美丽的地方，南美或是其他地方。

as all of this has blown over.
等到这事情转淡后我会去你哪里。

现在，Jonnie，你说过我的快乐是最重要…

you behaved as if it was.

who decides how long this show will run.

“她的眼神”？你跑不了多远。

about the younger generation.

Robinson。我以前听过这名字。

Now you're going too far.
现在你太过分了。

I suppose you think I believed that
that Mr. Smith, who came here to tea...

...was a real detective.
…是个真的侦探。

845

If I hadn't heard her maid's voice outside
the dressing room, they'd have got me.
如果我没有听到她佣人在更衣室外的声音，
他们早就把我抓了。

01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,800

Eve, darling, I know I should
never have trusted her.
Eve，亲爱的，我知道我不该相信她。

847

Darling, you've been wonderful to me.
I don't deserve it, but I need you.

I thought my brain would burst.

Oh, Roehampton Club, please.
噢，麻烦你，去Roehampton会所。

856
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:34,440

It couldn't be helped, I'm afraid.
You must blame a Miss Doris Tinsdale.
我恐怕，这帮不上忙。

她是Charlotte Inwood的临时佣人。

One of our men at the theater...

You're very sweet to say so.

got to do with the case?
这个Doris Tinsdale的人跟这案件有什么关系？

Or shouldn't I ask, Mr. Smith?
或许我应该问，Smith先生？

唔，Cooper昨晚在剧院出现，我们认为她看见他。

After all, my name is...

Not very good, is it?

It suits some people very nicely.

870
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,640

I rather liked it when you called me
"Ordinary Smith."
我情愿你叫我“普通人Smith”。

871
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:19,160

- But I liked it. I liked it very much.
- 噢，我不是故意的，真的。

Please go on calling me that, will you?

What were we talking about?
我们在说什么？

875
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:33,600

Oh, yes. I was going to ask you,
why did Cooper risk going to the theater?
噢，对。我本来要问你，
为什么Cooper要冒险到剧院？

876
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,080

He must have had a very strong reason
for wanting to talk to Miss Inwood.
他一定有很重要的原因要跟Inwood小姐说话。

877
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:41,320

Do you hate inquisitive people?

879
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,840

Of course not. I'm one myself.

But seriously, Ordinary, do you think there's
anything between Cooper and Miss Inwood?
但认真的，按常理的，你认为Cooper
和Inwood小姐之间是不是有些什么？

Seriously, "Extraordinary,"
I shouldn't be a bit surprised.

What a curious person she must be.
她肯定是一个非常好奇的人。

883
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:09,720

I mean, going back on the stage
so soon after everything.
我是说，发生那么多事可以马上回到舞台。

884

The show must go on.
表演一定要继续。

885
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:15,720

A smiling face, a breaking heart.
Actors rather like it, I'm told.

886
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,880

But today...

to the garden party.
…从丧礼直接到园游会。

888
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,200

I must say, I think that's
overdoing things a bit.
我只可以说，我觉得有点过火。

889
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:28,440

A strong sense of the dramatics
and all that sort of thing.
所有的一切加起来太过戏剧性了。

890
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,040

I was wondering...

with her husband's death.

Were you?

01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,080

After all...

that doesn't appear on the surface.

900
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,680

...wheels within wheels.
…轮子里面还有轮子。

901

in a woman's mind?

to get my programs.

the whole afternoon with you?
我不能整个下午陪你你明白吗？

I can't take you with me.

what color your eyes are, you disappear.
每次我开始看清楚你眼睛的颜色，你就消失了。

I mean, what do you think of it?
我意思是，你怎样想？

Miss Tinsdale to see you.
Tinsdale小姐来见你。

Well, this is a pleasure. Where have
you been? I thought you were dead.
这样，真是幸会。你去了哪里？我还以为你死了。

977
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:44,400

Oh, no, madam. I wasn't.
As a matter of fact...
噢，不，夫人。我没有。事实上…

978
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:48,600

You needn't go into detail. I hope you're not
turning into one of those explicit people...
你不需要太清楚。我希望你不会变成那种…

979
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:51,520

...who always tell you exactly
how they feel when you ask them.
…只在你问的时候才告诉你他们的感受的人。

980
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,720

You did leave me a trifle suspended,
however.
但你只留给我些无关痛痒的。

981
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,600

I'm sorry, madam.

Whatever happened to that
peculiar figure of yours?

It's a new dress, madam.

Keep it, dear.

987
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:09,200

What it does for you is worth thousands.

988
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,760

I bought it at a sale.
我在减价的时候买的。

989

Don't confide in me.
Just pour some tea, would you?
别告诉我秘密。倒点茶，好吗？

990
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,280

By the way, Doris...

01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,480

...did Nellie tell you the police
want to talk to you?

992

But whatever for, madam?
但关于什么，夫人？

993
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,000

Oh, I hope they won't upset my dad.
噢，希望他们没让我爸担心。

994
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:29,880

- My dad said...
- They're not going to eat you, darling.
- 我爸说…
- 他们不会把你吃掉，亲爱的。

995
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:33,840

It's not important. Just pull yourself
together and pour the tea.
这不重要。只要保持冷静来倒茶。

01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:41,120

Rehearsals from morning till night.
If we wanted to misbehave...
从早到晚的彩排。如果我们想捣蛋…

- No.
…我们还有时间。
- 不。

998
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:47,080

Yes, so I understand. Eve tells me she kept
hard at it all day and evening.
好，我明白了。
Eve告诉我她从白天到晚上都在努力。

999
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:50,920

But Eve hasn't been near for days. I thought
she was home with a cold or something.
但Eve离开了几天。我以为她不舒服在家。

1000
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,960

- Maybe she's got a job in a show.
- Gosh.
- 可能她在演出中找到工作。
- Gosh。

1001
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:57,800

A fortune in five minutes,
and there's no income tax on it tonight.
<i>五分钟的发财机会，</i>
<i>还不用缴入息税就在今晚。</i>

1002
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,200

Excuse me, madam. I've...

1003
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:16,360

I've got to sneeze.
我要打喷嚏。

1004

- 我想你是，Livingston小姐。
- 那不是我的名字。

1005
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:45,400

Oh, no, no. It's Nellie Goode, isn't it?
But what does the name matter?
不，不，不。这是Nellie Goode，不是吗？
但这个名字有什么关系？

1006
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:48,760

After all, I could think of lots of much
more appropriate names for you.
其实，我可以想出一大堆更适合你的名字。

1007
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,280

Yes, I could think of a few for you too.
Who are you?
对，我也可以想出几个给你。你是谁？

1008
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,080

I understand my daughter has entered
into a somewhat shady transaction.
我明白我女儿在走霉运。

1009

- Well, you are a blackmailer, aren't you?
- 我不知道你在说什么。
- 嗯，你想勒索，是不是？

1010
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,520

You know, that's a very,
very naughty thing to be.
你要知道，那是非常，非常丑恶的事。

1011
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:06,200

Don't say things like that to me.
You could be had up for a thing like that.
不要把我说成这样。
你可能会做出这种事。

1012
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,720

Now, don't be so peppery.
现在，不要太刻薄。

- 我喜欢用友善的方式去处理事情。
- 小了一张。

1014
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,440

It's all I've got. You don't want
me to walk home...
这是我的全部。你不想我走路回去…

1015
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,560

I don't care if you crawl home.

1016

Oh, well, it doesn't matter. I'm not mean.
And you've got till tomorrow morning.
噢，那，没所谓。我不会计较。你明早再给也可以。

manager, spotted me as Doris.
父亲，Freddie Williams，Charlotte的经理人,

I had to go into Charlotte's tent.
我一定要进去Charlotte的帐幕。

如果有件我讨厌的事，就是说我告诉过你。

And the police want to talk to Doris.
I don't know which way to turn.
而警察想跟Doris谈话。
我不知道转那一边。

01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,800

I think I'll get Smith
and tell him the whole story.

1022

Have you got him to suspect
Charlotte yet?

I'm afraid not.

1024
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:43,680

But I thought you had to pick him up at
Whitehall. Didn't you talk to him about it?
但我以为你在Whitehall接他。你没有跟他说过？

1025

But, yes, I did...

Oh, I see.

Some more important topic arose
in the conversation.

my dear: Jonathan.
现在只剩下一点小麻烦，我亲爱的：Jonathan。

of changing horses in midstream?

Father, is it awful of me?
爸爸，我是不是很坏？

1033
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,120

Not awful, my dear,
just rather a bad bit of timing.
不是坏，亲爱的，只是时机不对。

1034

No matter how my feelings
toward him change...
不管我对他的感觉怎样改变…

1036
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,240

Not while he's hiding in our house.
不能在他还躲在我们房子的时候。

1037

还说你自己是演员？
这是你的大舞台，如果你有胆量去演。

1038

You have the law on your arm. All you have
to do is rush in there and shout, "Stop!
法律就在你手上。你只需要跑进去大声说，“停！

That woman is a murderess!"
那女人就是凶手！”

1040
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,360

And you'll say, "I'll dare and dare again.
接着她会说，“你怎能这样？”
你会说，“我会继续这样。

01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:45,240

What about the bloodstained dress,
eh, Miss Charlotte Inwood?"
那有血迹的裙子怎样，
嗯，Charlotte Inwood小姐”。

- 然后她说…
- 拜托。这很严重，爸爸。

No. Most women don't talk enough.

- 我讨厌害羞的女人。
- 没有人说过我害羞…

1048
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,480

Who'll come over to shoot
some lovely ducks?
谁会来这里射这些可爱的鸭子？

1049
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,920

It will only cost you half a crown,
and it does such good for the orphans.
只花你半个钱币，为孤儿们做点好事。

here for half a crown?

I have an idea.
你看，Eve，停下来。我有个主意。

as near the front as you can.

- 我们听Charlotte唱歌好不好？

1080
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,280

It breaks somewhere here. I can't...

1081
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,320

It's rather...
这有点…

1082
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,320

Perhaps I can manage.
或许我有办法。

1083
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,960

Wait a minute. I think you'll have to do
it yourself. I'm not frightfully good.
等一下。我想你要自己搞定。我不是那么能干。

1084
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,640

Be rather careful, won't you?
You know, it goes off.
请小心点，好吗？你知道吗，会走火。

1085
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,680

Got you again, my beauty.

My bird, I think, sir.

- 对。半个钱币真值。
- 你肯定足够吗？

Oh, yes, certainly. Yes, I don't need
any more. I very seldom miss.
噢，是，当然够。
对，我不需要更多。我很少失手。

the doll, please?
噢，终于打到。我可以拿那娃娃吗，麻烦你？

对不起，先生，我想那是我的。

1097
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:11,120

What did you say?
你说什么？

1098
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,320

Nothing at all.
没什么。

It is rather nice, I think,
to have won it, don't you?
我觉得能赢到这个，挺好的，是不是？

dolls. They're fully dressed. Fully.

duck for only half a crown!
这里非常有趣只花半个钱币就可以射鸭子！

1105
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,040

1106
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:02,560

I'm sorry, sir.
对不起，先生。

Do you think there's anything between
Cooper and Miss Inwood?
<i>你觉得Cooper和Inwood小姐之间</i>

But Eve hasn't been near for days.

and here we are.

and stormy life of Doris Tinsdale.
这就是Doris Tinsdale的短暂又多灾多难的人生。

1119
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,240

It is in many respects a sad one,
but, one hopes...

...not entirely without usefulness.
…不是完全没用。

1121
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,800

The next thing is to wait
for the arrival of Mr. Ordinary Smith...
接下来就是等普通Smith先生来。

1122
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,520

...with his posse to arrest
the whole boiling lot of us.
…他的职责是把我们这帮人全逮捕。

Well, you think I should give myself up,
is that it?
那，你觉得我应该自首，是不是？

1124
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:12,760

Yes, I should, shouldn't I? The longer
I stay here, the worse it will be for you.
是，我应该，不是吗？我在这越久，对你越麻烦。

1125
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:16,320

But I won't give up. There must be
a way to get at Charlotte.
但我不会放弃。一定有办法逮到Charlotte的。

1126
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:20,120

Now, I've made a nice hot toddy
for you, Mr. Robinson.
来了，我给你弄了一杯热toddy，Robinson先生。

1127
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:22,600

There's nothing like it for a cold,
is there?

Thank you.
谢谢。

1129
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:28,480

Isn't it dreadful? Mr. Robinson hasn't been
able to stir out of his room since he arrived.
是不是很绝望？从到这里起
Robinson先生都不能离开房间。

1130
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,520

These spring colds are really frightful.
这些春天的感冒真是挺可怕。

噢，Eve，Smith先生在楼下，他想见你。

I think it would be such a good idea...
我想会是个好主意…
I think it would be such a good idea...

01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:39,640

...if I made Mr. Robinson a nice,
hot mustard plaster.
…如果我弄个热的介末意粉，给Robinson先生。

1134
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,720

I wonder if he's got a temperature.
不知道他是否发烧。

1135
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:45,360

I've broken my thermometer, but you could
easily run to the chemist's...
我打破了的探热针，但你很容易可以找到药店…

Miss Inwood's maid?

to ask Doris Tinsdale a few questions.
我想你也知道，
我们急于要问Doris Tinsdale几个问题。

On his way to Miss Inwood's dressing room.
在他去Inwood小姐更衣室途中。

1142
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:23,120

He was there when she went up to change.
当她上去换衣服时他就在哪里。

1143
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:26,080

I listened at the door and overheard
him say something about...

...a bloodstained dress belonging to her.

And then suddenly, she became afraid.

Do you hear? Afraid.

When you took Sergeant Loomis
up to the room...

1148
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:38,200

...you presumed Cooper to be still there?
…你以为Cooper还在那里？

1149
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,200

Well, I didn't know.
那，我不知道。

1150
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,680

No, you didn't know,
but you had a pretty fair idea.
不，你不知道，但你相信是。

1151
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,520

Why didn't you tell Loomis?
为什么你不告诉Loomis？

1152
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:50,000

Then you did a very neat fainting fit, which
probably allowed Cooper to get clear away.
然后你刚好有点晕，
很可能就让Cooper有机会离开。

1153
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:54,000

Don't talk like that.

I don't understand it.

- 你怎可以用这态度？

I don't think that's necessary.
我不觉得有这需要。

1158

In my job, I find a woman goes to almost
any length to protect her lover.
在工作中，我发现一个女人

01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:16,280

But it's not like that.

...but I'm not anymore.

But it doesn't mean I won't go on
helping him, as I would any innocent man.
但这不代表我不会帮他，
就像对其他无辜的人一样。

1164
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:31,120

It's not for you to decide whether he's
innocent or not. You leave that to the law.
他是不是无辜不是又你来决定。
你应该让法律来决定。

1165
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,400

The point is, you put yourself
and your father...
问题是，你把你和你爸…

1166
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:36,760

...in a very serious position
by this infernal amateur meddling.
…因为这极丑恶的事处于一个很严重的处境。

01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,480

How I'm going to get you out of it,
I don't know.

1168

But you do want to get us out?
但你也想我们可以解脱？

1169
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,800

In spite of the fact you made such
a fool of me, you mean.
虽然事实上你是那么愚蠢，像你说的。

1170
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:51,480

Your acting in the taxi
was extremely clever.
你在的士上的表演是非常聪明。

1171
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,440

I wasn't acting in the taxi.
我在的士上不是在表演。

1172
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:03,680

I fell in love with someone,
and all my plans went out the window.
我爱上某人，我什么计划都抛诸脑后。

1173
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,720

When we were in the taxi together, I felt
as though I were on a great golden cloud.
当我们一切在的士上，我觉得虽然我是多么伟大。

1174
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,920

I told Father I didn't want to go on
with this. I wanted to tell you everything.
我告诉爸爸我不想继续下去。我想把一切告诉你。

1175
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:19,000

But he had an idea about
a bloodstained doll, and I had to put it off.
但他有个染血娃娃的主意，所以我搁置了。

01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,200

I wanted to tell you all about it.
我想告诉你所以事情。

1177
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:24,720

Please believe me.
请相信我。

1178
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:30,480

Would you like to mix a cocktail
yourself, Mr. Smith?
你想自己来调杯鸡尾酒吗，Smith先生？

1179
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:34,440

I'm afraid there's no ice,
but I'm sure you can manage.
恐怕这里没有冰块，但我知道你能应付。

1180
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,480

- Good evening, Smith.
- Good evening.
- 晚上好，Smith。
- 晚上好。

1181
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:41,680

- It's only the plumbing.
- 我好像听到有铁链撞击的声音？
- 只是那水泵。

1182
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,440

It's in a dreadful state.
是很悲哀的状态。

1183
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,600

How did you enjoy the garden party,
Mr. Smith?
园游会好玩吗，Smith先生？

1184
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,880

It must have been awful in that rain.
在下雨一定很扫兴。

1185
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:51,400

I think I'll take some sherry
up to Mr. Robinson.
我想拿点sherry酒上去给Robinson先生。

1186
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:55,120

I've quite changed my mind about him.
He seems such a nice young man after all.
我对他的感觉改变不少。
说到底他好像是个不错的小伙子。

1187
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:58,520

Eve, dear, you will look after
Mr. Smith, won't you?
Eve，亲爱的，你来招呼Smith先生，好吗？

what we're trying to do.

Oh, what a pity.
噢，太可惜了。

1191
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:11,760

Just when you and I were about to save
Mr. Smith so much trouble.
就在我和你快要省去Smith先生很多麻烦的时候。

1192
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:14,560

Save me trouble?
省去我的麻烦？

1193
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:17,960

Sir, you don't look like an irresponsible
imbecile. Why behave like one?
先生，你不像是个不负责任的傻瓜。
为什么这样做?

1194
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:22,360

You let your daughter get mixed up in this?
What sort of father do you think you are?
你让你女儿牵涉这事？你想你是个怎样的父亲？

1195
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,880

Unique. Quite unique.
特别。听特别的。

1196
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:28,640

But rather broken-hearted at this moment.
You see, I have another idea.
但现在挺伤心的。你知道吗，我另外有个点子。

浪费点子是很可惜，不是吗？

1198

Have you...? Have you ever
been blackmailed, Mr. Smith?
你有没有…？你有没有被勒索，Smith先生？

1199
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:38,360

Well, I have. Only this afternoon.
唔，我有。就在这个下午。

1200
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,920

At least my daughter and I were,
by Nellie Goode.
起码我女儿和我就有，被Nellie Goode。

1201
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:44,120

Yes, most inappropriate name.
I told her so.
对，很不恰当的名字。我告诉过她。

1202
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:47,920

She touched us for 24 pounds, and do you
know why I think it was well-spent?
她要我们24英镑，你知道为什么我觉得值得？

1203
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,680

- Though we could ill afford it.
- Come to the point, please.
- 虽然我们是花不起。
- 快入正题，麻烦你。

1204
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:55,800

Well, it struck me that what Nellie could do,
Doris could do.
那，让我很惊讶Nellie能做出，Doris那做出。

1205
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:58,040

I mean suppose she went
to Miss Inwood and said:
我的意思是假如她去跟Inwood小姐说：

1206
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:01,120

"Look, Miss Inwood,
I've got a certain dress of yours.
“你看，Inwood小姐，我有你某一条裙子。

1207
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:04,520

It's ruined, but it's still worth money."
她怀了，但它依然很值钱。”

1208
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:09,720

And suppose Miss Inwood said, "All right,
I'll give you 100 pounds for it."
假如Inwood小姐说，“好吧，我给你100英镑要它”

1209
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,240

What then, eh?
那怎样，嗯？

1210
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:15,000

And suppose you happened
to be listening.
假如你刚好听见。

1211
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:18,560

Well, that's what police do
in blackmail cases, isn't it?
那，这是警察要管的勒索案，不是吗？

1212
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,800

What about it, eh? What about it?
怎样，嗯？怎样？

1213
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:24,760

Oh, you needn't be afraid that Doris
couldn't do it. She could do it, Doris could.
噢，你不用担心Doris做不来。
她办得到，Dois可以。

1214
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:28,840

I mean, Eve could. She's a very good
actress, a very good actress indeed.
我意思是，Eve可以。她是个很好的演员，
一个确实是很好的演员。

1215
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,600

I'm sure she is.
我肯定她是。

1216
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:36,080

By the way,
is there a bloodstained dress?
说回来，是否有一条有血迹的裙子？

1217
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:40,120

Well, no. No, not exactly.
那，没有。没有，不算有。

1218
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:43,760

Look, there was
a bloodstained dress, only...
这，本来是有一条有血迹的裙子，只是。

1219
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,440

- Couldn't we tell you...?
- I'm getting back to the office.
- 我们可否告诉你…？
- 我要会办公室。

1220
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:48,640

I'll let you know about this later.
我晚一些再告诉你。

1221
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:55,000

In the meantime, what's Miss Inwood
doing without a dresser?
同时，Inwood小姐没有服装师会怎样？

1222
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:58,680

You better run along to the theater before
she starts getting impatient.
你最好在她没有耐性前回到剧院。

1223
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:02,920

It's all right.
那好吧。

1224
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,920

- What do you mean, "It's all right"?
- He's trying to save face.
- “那好吧”是什么意思？
- 他在挽回面子。

1225
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:07,280

Not a bad face, either.
同时，也不想难看。

1226
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:10,480

He'll let us do it. What's the matter
with you? Aren't you pleased?
他会让我们去做。你怎么啦？不高兴吗？

1227
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:13,800

Come on. We better hurry.
来吧。我们快点。

1228
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:17,880

Come to Burton Street and bring two men.
Post them at either end of the street.
去Burton街带两个人来。让他们守在街的两头。

1229
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:21,440

I'll be waiting at the telephone booth
at the corner. All right?
我就在转角的电话亭里等着。没问题？

1230
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:43,400

Hello. Is that Mrs. Gill?
Is the commodore available?
你好。是Gill小姐吗？指挥官在吗？

1231
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:46,720

Oh, he's gone out. Is Miss Eve there?
噢，他出去了。Eve小姐在吗？

1232
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:49,400

Oh, she's out too. No, one moment.
噢，她也出去了。不，等一下。

1233
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:52,360

May I speak to Mr. Robinson, please?
我可以跟Robinson先生说话吗，麻烦你？

1234
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:12,800

- What's your idea, governor?
- Just a little experiment.
- 你意思怎样，首长？
- 只是个小小实验。

1235
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,320

- Plug it in.
- Okay.
- 去吧。
- 好。

1236
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,600

The mike's in position.
<i>米高峰已经到位。</i>

1237
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:35,120

I'm speaking about three foot from it.
Can you hear me?
<i>我离它三英尺左右。</i>
<i>你听到我吗？</i>

1238
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:39,000

- Tell him the sound's all right.
- Okay.
- 告诉他声音没问题。
- 好。

1239
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:43,600

Do you think it'll work?
你认为行得通吗？

1240
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,200

What a day, darling.
难熬的一天，亲爱的。

1241
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:48,200

I've never in my whole life been so glad
to see the end of it.
终于完了这辈子都没试过那么开心。

1242
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,560

- Yes, madam.
- You must be tired too.
- 是，夫人。
- 是一定也很累。

1243
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:53,240

It can't be easy to be a dresser
with no experience.
作为一个没经验的服装师也不容易。

1244
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:56,640

But you're quite good.
Very good, indeed.
但你不错。确实不错。

1245
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:00,120

Oh, that rain.
That rain at the garden party.
噢，那场雨。在园游会那场雨。

1246
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:03,680

Thank goodness it didn't rain at the funeral.
That would have been too much.
还好在葬礼时没有下雨。
那就太多了。

1247
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,000

I hate rainy funerals.
我讨厌葬礼上下雨。

1248
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:08,760

And then somebody sent up
that disgusting doll.
还有某人送你那恶心的娃娃。

1249
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:12,520

What vermin some vermin are.
害虫就是害虫。

1250
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:14,160

Yes, madam.
是，夫人。

1251
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:16,880

By the way, did the police find you?
话说回来，警察有没有找你？

1252
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,840

I haven't seen them yet, madam.
我还没有看见他们，夫人。

1253
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,080

And anyway,
I've got nothing to tell them.
不管怎样，我没什么要告诉他们。

1254
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:22,840

Well, I suppose that's all.
那，我想也没什么了。

1255
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,920

And that horrible Nellie
will be back tomorrow.
那可恶的Nellie明天就回来。

1256
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:30,360

We may never see each other again.
Ships that pass in the something or other.
我们以后也不会见面了。天下无不散的宴席。

1257
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:35,160

I like you. You're so very sweet and patient.
I don't suppose I'm easy to get on with.
我喜欢你。你很可爱又有耐性。
我不是那么容易相处的。

1258
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:38,200

Oh, but you are, madam.
It's been wonderful working with you.
噢，但你是，夫人。为你工作非常好。

1259
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:40,480

And I do love the theater so.
而且我也很喜欢剧院。

1260
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:43,520

I don't see why. It's an awful life, really.
我不那么认为。这是讨厌的生活，真的。

1261
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:45,760

Here, darling.
A little something extra for you.
这里，打令。还有些小东西给你。

1262
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:47,160

I couldn't, madam. Honestly.
我不能要，夫人。真的。

1263
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:51,200

Don't be an idiot. Put it in the bank
or go out and get drunk or something.
不要那么笨。放在银行或是去外边吃喝玩玩。

1264
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,200

- Thank you, madam.
- Can I give you a lift?
- 谢谢你，夫人。
- 我可以送你一程吗？

1265
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:56,880

- Lf you would drop me, I'd appreciate it.
- All right. Come along, then.
- 如果你载我一程，我会很感谢。
- 好吧。那么，一起走。

1266
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:07,680

- Good night.
- Good night.
- 晚安。
- 晚安。

1267
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,960

- Good night.
- Good night.
- 晚安。
- 晚安。

1268
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:22,520

- Miss Inwood, could I talk to you in private?
- We can talk in the car. That's private.
- Inwood小姐，我可以私底下跟你聊聊吗？
- 我们可以在车里谈。那是私人空间。

1269
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:24,720

No, that won't do.
I've got to talk to you now.
不，那不行。我现在就要跟你说。

1270
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:26,480

What's all this about?
这是关于什么？

1271
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:29,040

Let's go someplace
where nobody can hear us.
我们去没有人听见的地方吧。

1272
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,760

Good night.
晚安。

1273
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,120

- Have you gone mad or something?
- No, madam.
- 你有毛病还是疯了？
- 不，夫人。

1274
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:39,360

I want to tell you about
the bloodstained doll.
我想告诉你关于那有血迹的娃娃。

1275
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,760

Well, what about that doll?
那娃娃有什么事？

1276
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:55,400

Oh, I hate all this, madam.
I'm that nervous.
噢，我讨厌这一切，夫人。我非常紧张。

1277
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:58,160

I'm so afraid of doing the wrong thing.
我好害怕坏了事。

1278
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:02,080

You see, I have a dress that belongs to you
with a big bloodstain down the front.
你明白吗，我有一条属于你的裙子前面染了血迹。

1279
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:04,400

By rights, I know I should
go to the police...
正常来说，我知道我应该去找警察…

1280
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,960

...but, to tell you the truth,
madam, I'm afraid.
…但，老实告诉你，夫人，我害怕。

1281
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:10,040

My dad would murder me
if I got my name in the papers.
我爸会把我杀了如果我的名字上报。

1282
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:13,240

So, you see, I've come to you.
Maybe you could tell me what to do.
<i>所以，你也明白，我来找你。</i>
<i>或许你可以告诉我应该怎样做。</i>

1283
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:14,800

How much do you want?
<i>你想要多少？</i>

1284
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:18,200

Money never entered my head, madam.
I hope you won't think that of me.
<i>我没想过要钱，夫人。</i>
<i>我希望你不要这样想我。</i>

1285
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:23,240

Only if the dress were clean like new,
it might be worth, say, 75 or 100 pounds.
<i>我只想如果那裙子像新的一样干净，</i>
<i>它可能值，大概，75到100英镑。</i>

1286
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:26,240

I know nothing about
a bloodstained dress.
对有血迹的裙子我就一无所知了。

1287
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,960

This sounds to me remarkably
like blackmail.
我听起来好像是勒索。

1288
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:33,040

- I think I'd better call the police.
- Yes. Do call the police, Miss Inwood.
- 我想我还是报警比较好。
- 对。应该报警，Inwood小姐。

1289
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:35,960

We'll talk to them together.
我们一起去吧。

1290
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:39,560

- You're not the maid.
- No, I'm not.
- 你不是个佣人。
- 不，我不是。

1291
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,960

Why have you been pretending
all this time?
为什么你一直装着？

1292
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:46,520

Shall we say we needed evidence?
可以说我们需要证据吗？

1293
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:50,160

We? Are you from the police?
我们？你是警察派来的吗？

1294
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:53,040

How was the bloodstain
smeared on the dress?
<i>那血迹怎样沾到裙子上？</i>

1295
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:55,800

Who are you?
你是谁？

1296
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:59,360

Why were you so frightened when Jonathan
said he hadn't destroyed the dress?
当Jonathan说他没有毁灭那裙子
你为什么会那么害怕？

1297
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:03,440

- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You do know!
- 我不知道你在说什么。
- 你是知道的！

1298
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,040

Yes.
是。

1299
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,120

Some blood did splash on my dress.
有些血是喷到我的裙子上。

1300
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,200

I was there when Jonathan
killed my husband.
当Jonathan杀我丈夫时我是在场。

1301
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,920

- That's not true.
- It is, but I had nothing to do with it.
- 那不是事实。
- 是事实，但我跟这事无关。

1302
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:13,840

Jonathan wanted my name kept out of it.
Jonathan想我置身事外。

1303
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,440

He sent me back to his rooms.
我送我回到他的房间。

1304
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:18,200

He stayed behind to make it look
like robbery.
他留下来弄成好像是打劫。

1305
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:20,880

- Then he brought me a clean dress.
- You're lying.
- 然后他带我一条干净的裙子。
- 你说谎。

1306
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:23,480

It's a sacred truth. I swear to you it is.
千真万确。我可以向你发誓。

1307
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:24,920

Listen, whoever you are...
<i>听着，不管你是谁…</i>

1308
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:27,600

...I'll give you anything
if you keep me out of this.
<i>…我什么都可以给你</i>
<i>如果你让我置身事外。什么都可以。</i>

1309
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:30,680

My jewelry is worth over 10,000 pounds.
You can have it all.
<i>我的珠宝价值超过一万英镑。</i>
<i>可以全部给你。</i>

1310
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:33,520

And my furs or money.
How much do you want?
<i>还有我的皮草和钱。</i>
<i>你想要多少？</i>

1311
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:35,400

I'll give you anything. Anything.
<i>我所以都给你。所有。</i>

1312
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:38,560

I'm going now to break it up.
Bring them in. I want them together.
我现在就去破案。带她们进来。我要她们一起。

1313
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:41,080

You deliberately tried to pin
it all on Jonathan...
<i>你故意把一切推到</i>
<i>Jonathan身上…</i>

1314
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:44,600

...assisted by Mr. Freddie Williams.
- It's not true, I tell you. It's not!
…<i>由Freddie Williams先生协助。</i>
<i>- 这不是事实，我告诉你，这不是！</i>

1315
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:47,720

Well, you won't get away with it.
I warn you, that's all.
<i>唔，你是脱不了罪的。</i>
<i>我警告你，就这样。</i>

1316
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:20,520

I've had a terrible scene
with a lunatic girl.
我刚跟一个疯女孩有可怕的一幕。

1317
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:24,280

First she pretended to be my dresser,
then a detective and tried to blackmail me.
首先她扮成我的服装师，然后是侦探和想勒索我。

1318
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:28,280

That's all right, Miss Inwood. You stay here.
I'll have a word with you in a minute.
没问题，Inwood小姐。你留在这里。
我等一下会再跟你说。

1319
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:32,040

Oh, good. They got him.
噢，好。他们抓到他。

1320
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,480

Jonathan, what have they done to you?
Jonathan，他们把你怎样了？

1321
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:38,040

Why are you arresting him?
你为什么要逮捕他？

1322
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:40,760

Mellish, stand by Miss Inwood there!
Mellish，站在Inwood小姐旁边！

1323
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,760

Heavens, that must be Cooper.
天呀，一定是Cooper。

1324
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,280

Where's Miss Inwood?
Inwood小姐在哪里？

1325
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:48,560

Cover the alleyway in case he used
an emergency door.
守住小巷子以防他用太平门。

1326
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,600

- Where do those stairs lead to?
- Dressing rooms.
- 那些楼梯通到哪里？
- 更衣室。

1327
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:53,040

Eve! Eve, come back!
Eve！Eve，回来！

1328
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:54,520

Where's the nearest telephone?
最近的电话在哪里？

1329
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,600

- Eve.
- He came through an emergency door.
- Eve。
- 他穿过了太平门。

1330
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,600

Hurry up downstairs. Go on, hurry!
快下楼梯。来吧，快点！

1331
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,560

Get back into the theater.
回到剧院里去。

1332
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:03,640

Have you been told
to keep an eye on me?
有没有人叫你看着我？

1333
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:06,200

In a manner of speaking, yes.
口头上来说，有。

1334
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:11,040

- In that case, may I sit down?
- No harm in that.
- 这样的话，我可以坐下吗？
- 这没什么。

1335
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:12,920

Get me a chair, then.
那么，拿张椅子给我。

1336
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:15,160

Surely, ma'am. Surely.
当然可以，夫人。当然。

1337
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:16,680

- Done with the mike?
- Yes.
<i>- 米高峰用完了？</i>
<i>- 是。</i>

1338
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:20,040

Okay. I wonder if they caught...
<i>好。不知道他们有没有抓到…</i>

1339
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,280

What's the point of going up to the roof?
这是通往屋顶的吗？

1340
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:31,680

He may have doubled back along the alley
and gone up the fire escape.
他可能从小巷跑回并爬上火警楼梯。

1341
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:34,920

- So they've heard everything I said?
- Yes.
- 所以他们听到我所说的一切？
- 是。

1342
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:41,560

- And it's all in that book?
- All in there, in shorthand.
- 所有都在那本子上？
- 所有都在那，用速记。

1343
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:43,640

How clever of you.
你真聪明。

1344
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:47,440

Things look bad for me, don't they?
情况对我不利，是不是？

1345
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:51,800

I'm what you'd call an accessory...
I suppose.
我就是你说的一件配件…
我认为是。

1346
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,160

- George!
- Yes?
- George！
- 是？

1347
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:56,240

Smith wants you down
at the stage doorkeeper's office.
Smith想你下去舞台的门卫室。

1348
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:57,360

Thank you, darling.
谢谢你，打令。

1349
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:00,240

We'll need more men to cover
all the rooms in this place...
我们需要更多人手去把守这里的每间房…

1350
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:03,120

It's not all in there.
不是都在那里。

1351
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:06,520

- What's your name?
- Mellish.
- 你叫什么名字？
- Mellish。

1352
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:12,080

- Do you like dogs, Mellish?
- Yes, ma'am, I do.
- 你喜欢狗吗，Mellish？
- 对，夫人，为喜欢。

1353
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:15,560

But not all dogs.
但不是所有狗。

1354
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:18,000

If they don't love you,
you don't love them.
如果他们不喜欢你，你也不喜欢他们。

1355
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:20,040

- That's right, isn't it?
- I suppose so.
- 对，不是吗？
- 我认为是。

1356
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:24,800

I had a dog once. He hated me.
我曾经有过一支狗。他讨厌我。

1357
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:27,800

At last he bit me, and I had him shot.
最后他咬我，我把他射杀了。

1358
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:34,040

When I give all my love and get back
treachery and hatred, it's...
当我把所有爱付出而得到背叛和憎恨，就…

1359
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,800

It's as if my mother
had struck me in the face.
就好像我母亲打我的脸一样。

1360
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:43,160

Do you understand that, Mellish?
你明白这些吗，Mellish？

1361
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:45,400

I've heard it takes them
that way sometimes.
我听过有时会是这样。

1362
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:50,800

Yes. It takes some of them that way.
是。有些会是这样。

1363
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:53,240

- Has Miss Inwood gone yet?
- No, she's in the theater.
- Inwood小姐走了没有？
- 没有，她在剧院里。

1364
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:56,880

- Don't you think he's well away now?
- I'm sure I saw him run down the alley.
- 你不记得他已经跑得老远吗？
- 我肯定看见他走下小巷。

1365
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:58,480

This is Smith.
这是Smith。

1366
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:01,400

We're covering the theater
from the roof to the storeroom.
我们把剧院从屋顶到储物室都守住。

1367
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:03,480

- Fine, sir.
- You heard what Miss Inwood said.
- 好，先生。
- 你听到Inwood小姐说什么了。

1368
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,560

You can't have anything
against Cooper now.
你现在没有什么可以控告Cooper了。

1369
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:09,040

Nothing, except murder. He killed
Charlotte's husband, all right.
没有，除了谋杀。他杀了Charlotte的丈夫，对吧。

1370
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,760

He's killed before.
他之前已经被杀。

1371
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,840

What? What do you mean?
什么？你是什么意思？

1372
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,480

He got away with it last time with a plea
of self-defense. He won't this time.
他上次脱罪是因为自卫。这次他不可以了。

1373
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:18,240

- But Eve.
- She's alone with him now.
- 但Eve。
- 她现在跟他独处。

1374
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,040

Can't you see, sir?
She's in very great danger.
你不明白吗，先生？
她现在非常危险。

1375
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:40,160

It all adds up to a confession,
except she said you killed him.
这些加起来只是种忏悔，除了她说你杀了他。

1376
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:42,960

Anyone in their right mind
could see she was telling a lie.
任何正常人都看得出她在说谎。

1377
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:46,080

But I don't understand why Smith
arrested you. What happened?
但我不明白为什么Smith逮捕你。发生什么事？

1378
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:48,680

Somebody phoned and said
the police were on their way.
有人打来说警察快到。

1379
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:52,320

I made a bolt for it, and they
grabbed me at the street door.
我马上走出去，但他们就在门外把我逮着。

1380
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,600

Funny, that.
Getting me out into the street.
有趣，那电话。让我走到街上去。

1381
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:59,280

I suppose Smith didn't want me
to be caught in your house.
我认为Smith不想我在屋里被抓。

1382
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,800

That would have been awkward for you,
wouldn't it?
那会让你难堪，不是吗？

1383
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:04,080

I don't think they'll look
for us here for a bit.
我想他们不会来在这里找我们。

1384
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:07,200

After a while, maybe we can make
a dash through an emergency exit.
过一会，或许我们可以从紧急出口冲出去。

1385
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:12,920

Eve. Eve. Eve, wherever you are,
come away from him.
Eve。Eve。Eve，不管你在哪，远离他。

1386
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:16,400

Come away from him.
He's dangerous. He's a killer.
远离他。他是危险人物。他是杀人犯。

1387
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:19,080

Eve? Eve?
Eve？Eve？

1388
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:25,720

You're right, you know.
Charlotte was telling the truth.
你是对的，你也知道。Charlotte是说真话。

1389
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:32,160

What she didn't tell you was that
she goaded me into doing it.
她没有告诉你的是她诱迫这样做。

1390
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,720

She set me against him
in every way she could.
她用尽方法让我跟他对抗。

1391
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:37,960

She made me think she was crazy
about me, but she wasn't.
她让我觉得她迷恋我，但她不是。

1392
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:42,760

I was to kill her husband to leave
the coast clear for that Freddie Williams.
我去杀他丈夫使她可以跟Freddie Williams一起。

1393
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:47,000

I know that now.
She knew the sort of man I was.
我现在知道了。她了解我是那一类男人。

1394
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:50,400

She knows I can't control myself
if I get into a rage.
她知道如果我愤怒我是不能控制自己。

1395
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:53,280

Like a fool, I told her
about that girl I'd killed.
像个傻瓜，我告诉她关于我杀的那个女孩。

1396
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:56,520

Oh, Jonathan. Jonathan,
you don't know what you're saying.
噢，Jonathan。Jonathan，你不知道你在说什么。

1397
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:01,160

I can't help it, Eve. I can't control
myself, even when I was a kid.
我没办法，Eve。当我还是小孩的时候，
我也控制不了自己。

1398
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:06,000

I was lucky that last time. The little
fool threatened me with a gun.
上一次是我运气好。那小笨蛋用枪来吓唬我。

1399
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:09,560

But you don't know what it's like
to have a thing like this hanging over you.
但你不知道当这样的事发生在你身上会是怎样。

1400
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:16,080

Eve, I hated to tell you that
phony story in your car that time...
Eve，我不想告诉你那次在你车上的无稽故事…

1401
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,360

...but there was no other way.
…但是别无他法。

1402
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:23,400

Charlotte did go on to my flat
after I'd killed her husband.
我杀了他丈夫后Charlotte是来过我家。

1403
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:28,360

Her dress was stained a bit,
so I brought her a clean one.
她的裙子是沾污了一点，
所以我带了一条干净的给她。

1404
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:30,560

Then when she went to the theater...
当她去了剧院…

1405
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:33,360

...I made a big stain on it
to make you believe me.
…我染了一大片血迹在上面使你相信我。

1406
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:37,640

I'm telling you the truth now.
我现在跟你说实话。

1407
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:42,920

Jonathan...
Jonathan…

1408
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:46,760

...I feel desperately sorry for you.
…我对你感到极之难过。

1409
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,840

Really, I do.
真的，我是。

1410
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:54,000

No, you don't. You're not sorry at all.
不，你不是。你一点都没有感到难过。

1411
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,720

You don't care what happens to me.
你不关心我会发生什么事。

1412
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:01,800

Jonathan...
Jonathan…

1413
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:06,720

...you could give yourself up.
They'd take care of you.
…你可以去自首。他们会照顾你。

1414
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,840

You couldn't do all these things
unless you...
你不会做出这一切除非你…

1415
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:12,240

Unless...
除非…

1416
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:19,440

They can't do anything to a sick man,
and that's what you are. You must be.
他们可以用尽方法去让某人发病，
你就是这样。你一定是。

1417
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:24,600

No. They're going to hang me.
They'll hang Charlotte, too, for planning it.
不。他们会把我吊死。
他们会同时吊死Charlotte，因为是她策划。

1418
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:28,960

They've never forgiven me for getting
away with it the first time.
他们从没放过我因为我逃过第一次。

1419
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:34,280

There's nothing wrong with my mind.
Nobody can prove that there is, unless...
我的精神没问题。没有人能证明我有，除非…

1420
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:47,040

Unless I do it a third time...
除非我做出第三次…

1421
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:50,280

...with no reason whatever.
…毫无原因的。

1422
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:54,520

That would be a clear case of insanity.
那将会是明显的神经错乱。

1423
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:56,600

Wouldn't it?
不是吗？

1424
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:01,640

Wouldn't it?
不是吗？

1425
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:17,720

Jonathan. Jonathan,
I don't hear a sound now.
Jonathan。Jonathan，我现在什么都听不到。

1426
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:21,360

I think we can go now.
我想我们现在可以走了。

1427
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:25,360

We'll go out through the orchestra pit,
and then I'll take you to my father's boat.
我们在乐队包厢穿过，然后我去取我爸爸的船。

1428
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:29,520

Come along.
跟着我。

1429
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,000

Here he is!
他在这！

1430
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:03,200

Look! In the orchestra pit!
看！在乐队包厢！

1431
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:09,720

Mathews, quick! Down in the orchestra!
Mathews，快！在下面乐队席！

1432
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:18,600

- They've got him!
- Where?
- 他们抓到他了！
- 在哪？

1433
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:20,600

- They found him.
- Where was he?
- 他们找到他。
