1
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,156
- Any sign of the police?
- No, no sign.

2
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,311
- Looks like we're getting away with it.
- Good.

3
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,199
- How far is it to your father's boat?
- Two hours with luck.

4
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,954
Your luck seems to be very good,
touching wood.

5
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,793
Could you tell me now what happened?
I'd really like to know.

6
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,234
Only if you feel like it.

7
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,470
It's Charlotte Inwood.

8
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,151
- She's in a jam.
- That doesn't surprise me.

9
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,072
No, this is serious, Eve.
Deadly serious.

10
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,152
She was all over the place.
I had to help her. Anybody would have.

11
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,550
I was in my kitchen. It was about 5:00.

12
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,508
The doorbell rang, and I went downstairs
to see who it was.

13
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,555
Jonnie, you love me. Say that you
love me. You do love me, don't you?

14
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,553
I think he's dead. I'm sure he's dead.

15
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,711
I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it.

16
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,348
- Who's dead?
- My husband.

17
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,478
We had a terrible quarrel about you.

18
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,871
Oh, he was vile.
You know the sort of things he can say.

19
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,669
He started to hit me.
I grabbed something.

20
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,196
I was out of my mind with fear.
Oh, what am I to do?

21
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,318
Darling, pull yourself together.
He may not be.

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,396
The curtains, Jonnie. Draw the curtains.

23
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,712
I thought I had some brandy.

24
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,916
Here, drink this.

25
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,674
He was an abominable man.

26
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,717
Why do women marry abominable men?

27
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,598
- Where was all this?
- In my bedroom.

28
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,593
- Anyone else in the house?
- I left the servants in the country.

29
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,832
I drove up early to have an hour's rest
before the performance.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,549
Oh, what shall I do?
I can't go on. I can't.

31
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,075
- Has anyone seen you?
- No. I don't think so.

32
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,755
There wasn't a soul in the street.
I jumped into my car and came here.

33
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,512
It's parked around the corner.

34
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,910
Oh, Jonnie, what will they do to me?

35
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,152
Don't tremble like that. We'll find a way.
We'll see you're all right.

36
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,993
But you must call the theater.
I can't play tonight.

37
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,276
Tell them I'm ill.
Heavens, it'll be true enough.

38
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,670
No, you must go on tonight.
You've got to.

39
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,354
As if nothing had happened.
Nothing has happened.

40
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,988
You drove straight to the theater,
do you understand?

41
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,596
You haven't been home at all.
Now, get that into your head.

42
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,230
But my dress. There's blood on it.

43
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,233
- I must go back and change.
- No, you can't do that.

44
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,436
Or I could go myself.

45
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,355
Oh, darling, could you?
There's no one there.

46
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,999
I'd give you the key.

47
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,469
There's a blue dress like this
in the big cupboard...

48
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,074
...next to my window in the bedroom.
Here's the key.

49
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,028
- Are you sure the servants aren't back?
- No, but you must hurry. Please, Jonnie.

50
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,394
This is my only chance.

51
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,596
- You will, won't you?
- It's a risk.

52
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,193
Let me think a minute. I mean...

53
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,794
Well, you know
I want to help you, but...

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,436
Go or don't go. It's all the same.

55
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,636
I thought you loved me.

56
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,512
- Doesn't matter now.
- Oh, my dear. My darling.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,117
I'd do anything for you. You know that.

58
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,918
I'll be as quick as I can.

59
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,632
It was your maid, Nellie.

60
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,068
Oh, yes.

61
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,915
She was going to the house to pick up
some shoes I need for the show.

62
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,708
- Did she recognize you?
- I don't know.

63
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,714
You ought to get to the theater. The
police are bound to go tell you the news.

64
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,393
Give me my belt, darling, will you?

65
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,877
Oh, Jonnie, what have I done to you?

66
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,838
If Nellie recognized you,
it won't be safe here.

67
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,594
- You ought to go away.
- I don't think that'll do much good.

68
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,354
But they'll come here.
You must go at once.

69
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,795
Oh, my dearest darling,
you have saved me.

70
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,475
We must think of you now.
You've got to hide.

71
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,315
What do I care what happens to me?

72
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,436
Your job is to try to forget everything.

73
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,319
Let me do the worrying. I'll find a way.

74
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,036
Then we'll start again,
won't we, you and I?

75
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,749
No more stealth and cheating and lying.

76
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,074
I must hurry, darling.
But I worry about you.

77
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,550
Well, you mustn't. You're an actress.
You're playing a part.

78
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,757
- No nerves when you're on.
- I'll try.

79
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,552
My dress!

80
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,635
- I'll get rid of that. Don't worry.
- Don't come down.

81
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,677
We shouldn't be seen together.

82
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,559
- <i>Au revoir,</i> my darling.
- <i>Au revoir.</i>

83
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,070
And for heaven's sake, don't worry.

84
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,470
- Yes?
- May I speak to Miss Eve Gill, please?

85
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,598
Oh, dear, no. I'm afraid she isn't in.

86
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,751
She was going for the weekend
to her father...

87
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,993
...but I thought she'd be back.
- Yes, that's right. She got back last night.

88
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,278
She's had rehearsals all day today
at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

89
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,556
You know, the RADA.

90
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,597
Do you know when she...?
Where she is now?

91
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,598
Didn't you hear?

92
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,116
She's at the RADA rehearsing.

93
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,673
- Jonathan Cooper?
- Yes.

94
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,354
We're police officers.
May we see you for a few minutes?

95
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,829
Most certainly. Please come in.

96
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,549
- tell you that I can't possibly
accede to your request.

97
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,957
I've come to this decision after giving
the matter my earnest consideration.

98
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,759
Stop me if ever there was
such an ungrateful child!

99
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,434
No, darling. Don't run your words
into one another.

100
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,478
- the child most shamefully.

101
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,313
Is it not in your memory
that we, too, years ago...

102
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,153
...suffered the follies and fevers
of youth?

103
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,392
If our blood runs cooler and more
temperate, let us not account...

104
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,439
...to ourselves for virtue, but place it
to the credit of the soothing balm...

105
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,398
...of the passage of years
that we have fortifications...

106
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,915
...against the distempers of juvenility.

107
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,519
You were wont to be kinder than this.

108
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,319
No, Papa, you are cruel.
If all parents were of your mind...

109
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,268
...marriage would be impossible. Then
what would become of the human race?

110
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,433
- Go away. What are you doing here?
- The police are after me. You see them?

111
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,636
You have not, I hope,
forgotten the tragedy...

112
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,553
They think I killed a man.
Can you hide me on your father's boat?

113
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,551
Are you so heartless as to wish...?

114
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,914
They've just gone.

115
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,030
I was under the impression that this
was a class of intelligent students...

116
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,873
...trying to master an extremely
difficult and beautiful art.

117
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,795
I haven't the pleasure of knowing you,
young man...

118
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,269
...but I shall report your behavior
to Sir Kenneth.

119
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,034
Now we will begin the rehearsal again,
with the other cast.

120
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,751
- This cast think acting is fun and games.
- I'm terribly sorry, Miss Ashton.

121
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,675
- Oh, Jonathan.
- Let's go. Have you got your car here?

122
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,879
It's parked in front. I'll show you to the
back entrance and pick you up there.

123
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,068
Eve, do you hate me...

124
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,515
...now that you know
about Charlotte and me?

125
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,318
Why, I could never hate you, Jonathan...

126
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,951
...because we're...
We're such old friends.

127
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,951
And...

128
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,236
Well, just because.

129
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,038
But I do wish I'd taken lessons
on the second fiddle.

130
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,958
Good old Eve.

131
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,356
Bring him in here.

132
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,516
It's warmer.

133
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,588
Do you think I behaved like a fool?

134
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,551
On the whole, I think so.

135
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,473
I think your boyfriend
has behaved like a fool.

136
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,473
I have a strong premonition
that I'm going to behave like a fool.

137
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,518
- It's infectious.
- Do you mean you're going to help him?

138
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,113
Why not?

139
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,589
He's a friend of yours, isn't he?

140
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,399
- Oh, yes.
- I see.

141
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,198
More than a friend, eh?

142
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,511
When I'm with him, I get a feeling
in here that... That's sort of...

143
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,591
Yes. Well, we'll go
into the symptoms later.

144
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,719
Meanwhile, I take it you're either
keen on him or still hungry.

145
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,911
I'm in love with him.

146
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,999
You've roped him, but he's not yet
broken to harness. Is that it?

147
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,394
I wish Charlotte Inwood was in...

148
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,238
Oh, do you?

149
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,958
I've seen her on the stage.

150
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,510
She'd have made me laugh,
if I hadn't been strictly on my guard.

151
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,035
Well, she couldn't make me laugh,
off or on the stage.

152
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,839
I can't bear to sit by and see
what she's doing to Jonathan.

153
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,116
She's like an evil spirit.
Just look at him!

154
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,473
Ruined, and by a woman.

155
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,396
Now you want me to take the ruins
for a little cruise.

156
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,270
- Well, is that it?
- I thought you could take him...

157
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,671
...across the channel or to the
Irish coast. Then he could hide out a bit.

158
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,796
The journey sounds attractive,
but less so...

159
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,350
...to help a suspected murderer to
escape, particularly with my reputation.

160
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,317
There's nothing wrong
with your reputation.

161
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,040
Oh, indeed.
I rather flattered myself that there was.

162
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,919
As a matter of fact, the customs people
have their eye on me.

163
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,071
I'm suspected of being a smuggler.

164
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,196
- Well, you're not.
- Oh, yes, I am.

165
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,828
One cask of brandy?
That doesn't mean you're a smuggler.

166
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,636
- Two casks.
- That was 15 years ago.

167
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,509
I've done one or two other things since
that I didn't tell you or your mother about.

168
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,514
- Can't have been very much.
- Of course not. Not very much.

169
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,229
Nothing could appear very much
to a murderer's moll.

170
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,357
But I never hope to be appreciated.

171
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,476
Yes, your mother cured me of that.

172
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,029
That's why I never could be bothered
with your mother.

173
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,753
I appreciate you, Father. You and
Captain Kidd are my favorite heroes.

174
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,430
My child, I am not deceived.

175
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,639
If there's one thing I cannot bear,
it's insincerity.

176
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,719
But you've got to help him.
You will help him, won't you?

177
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,668
He's lonely. He hasn't got any friends
but me, and maybe you.

178
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,832
- You will help him, won't you?
- He hasn't got me...

179
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,274
...yet.

180
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,829
You're just dying to get into a part
of this, and you know you are.

181
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,468
A part in this melodramatic play,
you mean?

182
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,358
That's the way you're treating it, Eve.

183
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,193
As though it were a play
you were acting in at the Academy.

184
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,069
Everything seems a fine acting role
when you're stage-struck...

185
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,912
...doesn't it, my dear?

186
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,436
Here you have a plot,
an interesting cast...

187
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,388
...even a costume,
little the worse for wear.

188
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,950
Unfortunately, Eve,
in this real and earnest life...

189
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,476
...we must face the situation
and all its bearings.

190
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,352
Yes.

191
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,234
What do you mean?

192
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,473
Well, Miss Charlotte Inwood
appears to be an expert in garden paths.

193
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,552
I think she's led your young friend
up the garden path.

194
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,995
I think we should hesitate
before we follow him.

195
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,151
- But why?
- I don't know how this bloodstain...

196
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,233
...got onto this dress, but I do know that
somebody smeared it on deliberately.

197
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,833
But why should they do that?

198
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,310
Well, Miss Inwood is an actress,
a very good one.

199
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,675
She has an eye
for an emotional situation.

200
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,957
Supposing she wanted our somnolent
young friend to go to her house...

201
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,473
...and be spotted there.

202
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,474
Well, this sanguinary garment
would provide a very plausible reason.

203
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,029
A very plausible reason indeed.

204
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,510
So that's why she didn't change
her dress before she went to his rooms.

205
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,592
Well, I cannot imagine Miss Inwood
going to see her young man...

206
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,116
Or your young man, whose ever young
man he is, in this nasty, messy condition.

207
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,875
No. This dress is a clue, my dear,
a very important clue.

208
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,952
And though it grieves me, of all people,
to have to say it, Eve...

209
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,429
...I think we should go to the police.

210
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,309
Jonathan! Jonathan, wake up.

211
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,948
Jonathan, how far do you think
you could trust Charlotte?

212
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,315
I'd trust her with my life.
What do you mean?

213
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,835
This bloodstain
was put here deliberately.

214
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,549
Don't be ridiculous. You're trying to turn
me against Charlotte, but you can't.

215
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,030
What's this doing here, anyhow?
It should have been destroyed hours ago!

216
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,634
Fool! There goes the evidence
that could've helped you.

217
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,792
I'm doing all this for Charlotte's sake.
You're just jealous of her!

218
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,235
Young man, I'd remind you
you're my daughter's guest.

219
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,879
I'd like better manners from you.

220
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,837
Oh, I am sorry, Eve.

221
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,752
Please forgive me.

222
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,108
I lost my head for a moment.

223
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,590
I can hardly think.
I'm almost dead for want of sleep.

224
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,633
I wonder, would it be too much trouble
if I went to bed?

225
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,758
That is, if Commodore Gill
wants to let me stay.

226
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,152
Your room is at the head of the stairs.
You'll be quite comfortable.

227
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,197
And if you want anything
to read in bed...

228
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,079
...you'll find some quite good
murder mysteries in there.

229
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,878
Beg your pardon.

230
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,874
Look, Eve...

231
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,678
But he's just gone...

232
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,513
At last we are alone and unobserved.
You know, I'm beginning to enjoy this.

233
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,638
Father, do you think she arranged
to put the suspicion on Jonathan?

234
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,156
- Do you think she deliberately framed him?
- The thought had crossed my mind.

235
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,154
That was why I reluctantly suggested that
our friends, the police, ought to be told.

236
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,039
But it's too late. Our only evidence
has gone up the chimney.

237
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,430
But we must help him.
He'll do nothing for himself.

238
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,876
He's hopelessly in love with that woman.
It's up to us.

239
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,552
Yes, but it won't be easy.

240
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,917
It is easy.
I'll go to her and see her myself.

241
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,514
- Would that be wise?
- But I don't care if it is or not.

242
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,992
I'll tell her we know how the bloodstain
got on the dress and her every move.

243
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,034
I'll make her talk.
It'll be one woman to another.

244
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,111
An impressive situation at any time.

245
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,953
She won't be able to help
but give herself away. You'll see.

246
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,112
I won't see. I won't be there,
and neither will you.

247
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,748
If we're right in what we think,
she's a dangerous woman.

248
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,434
She won't give herself away.
You'd be giving her an alternative.

249
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,795
She has no alternative.

250
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,153
She might murder you.

251
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,310
Oh, don't be so melodramatic, Father.

252
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,119
Look, my love. Face facts.

253
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,759
What is the least that can happen to you
if you tackle this remarkable lady?

254
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,390
She'll at once pick up a little pink
telephone and call the police.

255
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,394
She will then give you in charge
for concealing a fugitive from justice.

256
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,949
Eventually, you will be tried
at the Old Bailey.

257
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,954
Well, if you're lucky, you might get off
with, now, let me see...

258
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,476
...a couple of years, which you
will spend in Holloway prison...

259
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,315
...meditating on the folly of transmuting
melodrama into real life.

260
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,633
Well...

261
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,997
The best thing you can do, my girl,
is to go back to your Academy...

262
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,071
...and practice
your soul-shaking antics...

263
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,834
...in surroundings where
they can't do any harm.

264
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,595
After all, this fellow can't possibly
mean all that to you.

265
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,749
But he does, Father.

266
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,878
- Move along, please.
- But I'd like...

267
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,395
Now move along, ma'am.
This is nothing to see.

268
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,513
Hello, Father?
I'm outside the Inwood house.

269
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,636
Outside? Why not inside?

270
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,997
Don't be ridiculous, Father. The police
won't let anyone near the place.

271
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,391
Really? How very extraordinary.

272
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,596
Look, you've done your best.
Come back here...

273
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,228
...and decide about the man
that came to dinner.

274
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,315
Oh, I feel awful. I've been listening
to the people in the crowd talking...

275
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,552
...and they assume that
you-know-who is guilty...

276
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,792
...and all the police have to do
is catch him. It's terrifying.

277
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,996
Yes, but the police may not
think he's guilty.

278
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,037
After all, they work in secret, you know.

279
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,112
They may have their own ideas
about a certain lady.

280
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,831
I wish I knew what
the police were thinking.

281
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,032
- Well, look, why not ask them?
- Well, that's easier said than done.

282
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,074
Oh, just a minute, Father.

283
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,159
- Father, goodbye now.
- Eve...

284
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,439
I'll see you back at the office
about 2:00, sir.

285
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,473
May I have a small brandy, please?

286
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,714
Madam. Pardon my intrusion,
but is there, by any chance...

287
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,714
...any assistance I could be of?
- No, thank you.

288
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,516
- I don't know how you pick up all the dirt.
- Oh, I get around.

289
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,433
Any case, I know Munson's...

290
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,276
Right from the horse's mouth.

291
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,999
I most solemnly assure you, madam...

292
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,596
...it would be a pleasure, if there was
any assistance I could be of.

293
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,034
Thank you very much.

294
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,555
If you will allow me to say so,
you look depressed.

295
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,156
Yes, the cheering word,
the helping hand...

296
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,436
I'm perfectly all right.

297
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,597
Oh, good. Right. Good, good.

298
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,789
Is there anything I can do?

299
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,509
Look, I don't know your trouble,
but you don't look very well to me.

300
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,275
A little brandy can't do you any harm.
Why not drink it?

301
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,275
My great-aunt died over a glass
of brandy, but it was her 15th that day.

302
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,795
- Feeling any better?
- Yes, thank you.

303
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,359
You left your lunch over there.

304
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,795
It won't feel lonely.
I'll go back to it in a minute.

305
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,712
Perhaps you're allergic to bars.
Look...

306
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,269
...would you feel less uneasy
if I sat with you, or more so?

307
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,512
- Perhaps you're allergic to strange men.
- No. I love strange men.

308
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,912
- I mean, I'm very fond of them.
- I'll just go and get my lunch.

309
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,233
The butler told me. Never saw such a
sight. They say his head was bashed in.

310
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,517
I heard they clocked him so hard his
false teeth went across the room.

311
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,911
I know I'm pretty silly, but I overheard
two people on the street today...

312
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,991
...talking about the murder.

313
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,549
They went into a lot of detail.

314
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,196
I felt so sick and giddy,
I just had to come in and have a brandy.

315
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,920
My father says I tend
to overdramatize everything.

316
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,436
I expect he's right. I know how you feel,
though. I hate violence myself.

317
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,319
Doesn't that make it
rather difficult for you?

318
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,996
I mean, I think we ought to face up
to the ugly side of life.

319
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,232
Now, me, for instance.
I'm an actress.

320
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,551
I ought to face up to all sorts
of experiences, oughtn't I?

321
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,429
Oh, I don't know. Supposing I happened
to be a librarian.

322
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,832
A librarian doesn't encounter much
violence except an encyclopedia falling.

323
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,150
But you're not a librarian, are you?

324
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,276
No, I'm not. How do you know?

325
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,640
Well, you just don't
look like a librarian.

326
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,995
- You don't look like an actress.
- Oh? I thought I did.

327
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,675
Well, I'm only a beginner, really. That is,
I've only played one part in public.

328
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,431
- Could I have seen you?
- I don't think so.

329
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,354
It was in the church hall.
I played the fourth deadly sin.

330
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,877
- Were you good?
- I was pretty deadly.

331
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,632
What was this Jonathan Cooper after?

332
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,759
- I heard there was nothing stolen.
- Perhaps he did it for the fun of it...

333
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,114
Poor Charlotte Inwood.

334
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,953
Imagine coming home and finding
your husband horribly dead...

335
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,918
...policemen and detectives
all over the house, and the blood...

336
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,229
Careful, careful.

337
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,598
Remember, you're sensitive to that sort of
thing. You'll bring on another fainting fit.

338
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,196
I hear that Charlotte Inwood's going back
into the show in a couple of days.

339
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,157
Must be dreadful to sing and dance...

340
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,880
...with that horrible picture
still burning in one's mind.

341
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,431
Oh, it's the old story, "Is not the actor
the man with a heart?" all over again.

342
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,875
I once had a cousin
who had a duodenal ulcer...

343
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,395
...and an extremely funny face,
both at the same time.

344
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,790
Everybody laughed
when he was telling his symptoms.

345
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,279
His name was Jim.

346
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,158
That must have been terrible.

347
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,880
Oh, I don't know.
Jim's quite a common name.

348
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,599
I wonder what Charlotte Inwood
is really like. Really, I mean.

349
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,149
- Oh, hello, Nellie.
- That's Charlotte Inwood's maid.

350
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,998
Hello, Nellie. I didn't expect
to see you so soon.

351
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,116
How are you bearing up after last night?

352
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,840
Mrs. Tippet, what I've been through.
All those policemen.

353
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,831
Bothering you with a lot of questions.

354
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,276
Questions? They've been asking me this,
asking me that, all morning long.

355
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,351
I didn't know whether
I was coming or going.

356
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,033
Gin and lemon, please, Mrs. Tippet.

357
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,758
- Not too much lemon, dear.
- Okay.

358
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,596
Mind you, they never laid a finger on me,
but, oh, the questions. Nag, nag, nag.

359
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,070
"How did you know it was Mr. Cooper?
How many times you see him and where?

360
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,198
And did he give you anything?"
Blimey, he never gave me nothing.

361
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,191
"And how long you been
Miss Inwood's maid?"

362
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,430
They was gentlemanly and polite,
all right...

363
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,875
...but give me the bleeding Russians
any day, dear.

364
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,873
Yes. You gotta watch your step
when you're up against the police.

365
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,429
If that wasn't enough,
when I came out of the house...

366
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,956
...the reporters pounced on me with their
questions, asking me the lowdown.

367
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,157
I just jumped out of my skin when that
photographer's flashbulb went.

368
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,880
Well, I mean, fancy taking my picture.

369
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,318
You're quite a celebrity, you lucky girl. I'll
have to buy the <i>Daily Mirror</i> tomorrow.

370
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,314
Of course, I'm not saying a word
to the reporters. Not a word.

371
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,836
After all, who discovered the body?

372
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,595
I'll be a star witness at that trial, and my
story ought to be worth something...

373
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,955
...and I've no intention of giving it away.

374
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:39,513
- Isn't she talking too much?
- Too much, too loud, too everything.

375
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,477
How do you feel now?

376
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,950
Oh, I feel a little better, thank you.

377
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,519
I have to go.

378
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,272
I don't like leaving you here alone.

379
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,431
Do you feel fit enough
to let me see you home?

380
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,512
- I have a car.
- Perhaps you'd better let me drive it.

381
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,036
Well, that's very kind of you.
I do still feel a bit wobbly.

382
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,954
To be quite honest, it isn't kindness at all.
I mean, I'm afraid I maneuvered it.

383
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,316
How clever of you.

384
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,677
You've got something there, Fred.
I'll drink to that, on you.

385
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,115
A double gin and lemon, please.

386
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,913
Double? All right, Nellie,
I hope it chokes you.

387
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,356
You don't miss a trick, do you?
You're always on the make.

388
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,915
My mother's really a dear. My father,
too, but they shout at one another...

389
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,752
...and neither one like to shout.

390
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,911
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this.

391
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,311
You've been extraordinarily kind and
you know nothing whatsoever about me.

392
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,478
Oh, I don't know, Miss Gill.

393
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,438
You were born in South Africa.
The 17th of September, wasn't it?

394
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,036
Educated in America and you're studying
at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

395
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,033
Your parents don't live together.
You're a very well-behaved lady...

396
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,714
...but allergic to murder,
and that drove you to drink.

397
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,074
I hope it's only temporary.

398
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,398
But I don't even know your name.

399
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,232
I only know that you play the piano.

400
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,029
I'm so sorry. It was stupid of me.
I forgot. My name is Smith.

401
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,716
Just ordinary Smith?

402
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,752
A detective?

403
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,911
I hope you don't mind.

404
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,634
Oh, no. Of course not.

405
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,478
Well, I'm delighted.

406
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,235
By the way, I don't suppose you and
your mother are interested in tea...

407
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,674
...with a detective, that is.

408
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,993
Of course. Especially with a detective.

409
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,869
- Would you like to have tea with us?
- I'd love to. How about this afternoon?

410
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,600
- Well, tomorrow, then?
- Yes.

411
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,115
Yes. That's fine.

412
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,514
And I could take your place.

413
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,917
You'd never get away with it. What
makes you think you could be a maid?

414
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,638
It would only be for a day or two.

415
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,995
You'd have to be her dresser
down at the theater.

416
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,913
You couldn't do that.
That's very highly skilled work.

417
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,640
- Well, I could if you told me how.
- It sounds phony to me.

418
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,473
All this trouble just to get
a newspaper story.

419
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,632
Well, we women reporters have
a tough job competing with the men...

420
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,836
...especially on
important stories like this.

421
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,195
And what paper are you on, may I ask?

422
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,476
Well, I can't tell you that.

423
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,791
If anything should go wrong,
it would be embarrassing for the paper.

424
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,678
Oh? And what about my job?

425
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,832
Suppose Miss Inwood found out
I was passing you off as my cousin.

426
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,672
I'm not sure she won't smell a rat.

427
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,478
I never been away ill for years.

428
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,837
But anyone could go sick.
And I could do it, really I could.

429
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,594
I've... I've done a bit of acting.

430
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,591
Character acting?

431
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,718
- Yes.
- I see.

432
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,714
All you gotta do is put on old clothes
and make yourself look common like me.

433
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,236
Let me explain why it's so important
that I get the right slant on this.

434
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,836
I think there's a romance between
Miss Inwood and this man named Cooper.

435
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,878
And where did you get this idea?
Do you know what I think?

436
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,315
- I think you're snooping for the police.
- Oh, no...

437
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,517
I saw you this morning sitting
on this very seat with a detective.

438
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,991
Oh, well, that was Wilfred Smith.

439
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,391
He's an old friend of mine.
I didn't get a thing out of him.

440
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,471
Charlie, double gin and lemon, please.

441
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,677
- Not too much lemon, dear.
- Same for me.

442
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,069
I can get five times that much from any
newspaper when the case is over.

443
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,078
Why not get both?

444
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,554
Caught you, have I?

445
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,156
Hope I don't intrude
on some deep conspiracy.

446
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,030
And I hope you find yourself no worse
for your distressing experiences.

447
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,512
Haven't I met your charming
friend before? I know that face.

448
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,954
This is my cousin Doris, Mr. Fortesque.

449
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,429
Oh, yeah. Charming. Charming.

450
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,434
Perhaps as dear Nellie didn't
provide me with your surname...

451
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,955
...you'll let me call you Doris, eh?

452
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,598
Mrs. Mason, I can't think what I've done
with my reading glasses.

453
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,513
Have you seen them anywhere?

454
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,279
- Could I...?
- Oh, there you are.

455
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,638
Help me find my glasses, Eve, darling.
I can't see a thing.

456
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,633
I'm Doris Tinsdale.

457
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,109
I'm from Nellie.

458
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,599
Move along there, please.

459
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,113
I'm Doris Tinsdale.

460
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,952
- Miss Inwood's expecting me.
- Oh, yes.

461
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,918
You're the temporary Nellie sent along.

462
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,395
Just wait over here a minute.

463
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,192
We'd like to see Miss Inwood. Can
I have a few words with you as well?

464
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,510
By all means.
Will you step this way, please?

465
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,513
I understand you've been in service
now for six or seven years.

466
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,514
Six years and nine months,
to be precise...

467
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,318
Come in.

468
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,633
Okay, yes. I'll come around
the box office tonight.

469
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,078
- What did they say, Freddie?
- More cancellations.

470
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,719
Oh, how stupid people are.

471
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,519
Even if my understudy's legs
are so peculiar...

472
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,671
...she's just as good as I am.

473
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,912
She knows darn well she'd better not be.
That's not the point.

474
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,389
It's you they want to see.

475
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,917
- Well, what do you want?
- I'm from Nellie.

476
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,354
Madam's expecting me.

477
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,195
The new girl's here, Charlie.

478
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,275
No, no. This doesn't fit me.

479
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,635
Here, here. Pull it up on this side.
The other side too.

480
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,916
You know that, don't you?

481
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,798
Excuse me, madam.

482
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,190
Read it to me, dear.

483
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,913
"Dear Madam, this will introduce
my cousin Doris...

484
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,672
...who is in every way a good girl."

485
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,956
Not so loud.

486
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,869
"I hope you'll find her satisfactory
during my illness. Signed, Nellie Goode."

487
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,918
This is very nice,
if you can call mourning nice...

488
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:29,349
...but isn't there some way we could let
it plunge a little in front? I suppose not.

489
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,988
"Signed, Nellie Goode."

490
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,278
If we could only work in a little
color somewhere. Oh, well.

491
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,756
"Signed, Nellie Goode."

492
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,712
Take off your hat, dear.

493
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,394
There are simply millions
of things to do, I'm afraid.

494
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,835
You won't mind if I depend
on you a great deal?

495
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,719
Thank you, darling.

496
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,276
Now, get me out of these weeds. I'm
beginning to feel sad, and I shouldn't.

497
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,670
It's so depressing.

498
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,917
See who that is.

499
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,913
What's your name?

500
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,719
Doris Tinsdale, madam.

501
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,073
Yes? What is it, Groves?

502
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,071
Divisional Detective Inspector Byard...

503
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,515
...and Detective Inspector Smith
to see you, madam.

504
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,113
Good heavens.

505
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,475
Hear that, Freddie? The police again.

506
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,108
- Show them up, Groves.
- Very good, madam.

507
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,238
I thought I told you to wait downstairs.

508
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,873
Hand me a negligee from that cupboard
over there, will you, Phyllis?

509
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,678
Now, what about this dress for the
theatrical garden party, Miss Inwood?

510
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,109
Black? Oh, yes, of course.

511
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,350
How clever of you to remember, darling.

512
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,636
Hold that for me, will you?

513
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,477
- Freddie.
- Yes?

514
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,552
We haven't decided. Am I going
to the theatrical garden party?

515
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,472
I don't feel an atom like it.

516
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,234
I keep thinking about those
dreadful cancellations.

517
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,356
I don't see why.
They're a compliment to you.

518
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,159
Hand me a comb and mirror
from over there, will you?

519
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,550
But they do cut down the takings.

520
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,269
I think I could appear tonight,
if you insisted.

521
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,271
Wouldn't it be a terrible strain for you?

522
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,715
Oh, ghastly.

523
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,317
But I can't help feel
for my poor, dear, loyal public.

524
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,596
Looking towards it for weeks...

525
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,070
...and then trailing back sadly
with their tickets...

526
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,516
...getting their money returned.
I simply can't bear it.

527
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,477
It would be pretty trying.

528
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,631
Waves of sympathy
coming on the stage...

529
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,995
...all the gangways flooded with tears.

530
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,199
I can hardly bear the thought myself.

531
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,511
No use trying to stop me.
I'm going on tonight.

532
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,591
Be at the theater at 6:00 sharp, will you?

533
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,513
- Yes, madam.
- Take this away.

534
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,672
You go right ahead, dear.
Garden party dress and everything.

535
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:48,709
And why don't we let ourselves
go a trifle just in front, huh?

536
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,394
And thank you so very much.

537
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,633
What do you suppose
the police wants now?

538
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,949
I don't know.

539
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,951
Must you speak to me
with your mouth full?

540
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,112
They've probably come to look under
your bed for Master Cooper.

541
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,990
What could I tell them about Cooper?
I know nothing about him.

542
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,752
Tell them just that.

543
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,633
Listen.

544
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,111
That's a good idea.

545
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,708
Elsie, darling, come here.

546
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,394
Now, I want you to wait
in the other room and listen.

547
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,632
When you hear me cough, you come
in and say, "The doctor's here."

548
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,994
Yes, madam.

549
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,991
You can stand just so much
of detectives.

550
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,435
After all, they are only policemen
with smaller feet.

551
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,310
- In here?
- The next door, sir.

552
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,072
What's the matter with Nellie?

553
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,676
Oh, it's her stomach, sir,
if you'll excuse the expression.

554
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,115
The tragedy and excitement
was too much for her.

555
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,589
- Highly strung type, eh?
- Oh, very, sir.

556
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,072
I suppose you know, Miss Inwood,
that whatever Cooper's motive was...

557
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,231
...it certainly couldn't have been robbery.

558
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,834
Of course, darling. I understand that.

559
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,919
I suppose he just tried
to make it look like robbery.

560
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,036
What's your name again?

561
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,677
- Doris, sir.
- You know, Doris, you're not bad-looking.

562
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,877
- Thank you, sir.
- You don't treat your face properly.

563
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,077
If you fixed your hair and used makeup,
you'd be quite attractive.

564
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,959
I suppose I shouldn't have seen him
as often as I did.

565
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,556
But I didn't realize how madly
infatuated he was with me.

566
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,917
I just didn't realize.

567
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,954
You'll never know how much
I blame myself for all this.

568
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,475
When my husband came back
from New York last week...

569
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,517
...and I told Jonnie I couldn't see him...

570
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,159
...he kept on phoning me.

571
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,072
He wouldn't let me alone.

572
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,470
Oh, maybe if I had agreed to see him...

573
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,676
...he wouldn't have done
this dreadful thing.

574
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,833
- When did you last see Jonathan Cooper?
- Let me think.

575
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,309
It must have been a week...

576
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,391
A week before my husband died.

577
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,750
- Go on. What are you waiting for?
- Did he come to this house?

578
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,797
Excuse me, madam.
The doctor's waiting to see you.

579
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,758
Oh, I'm so sorry, darling,
but I will have to see my doctor.

580
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,595
I'm feeling wretched.
I've been trying to get him all morning.

581
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,910
You see, I'm going on tonight.

582
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,116
The producer has insisted so much.

583
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,430
And I don't want to see him
ruined because of me.

584
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,160
That's all right. I think
we've covered most of the points.

585
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,198
If there's any more I can help you with,
you will let me know?

586
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,954
Thank you. We'll try not
to trouble you again.

587
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,314
Thank you.

588
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,596
You're so understanding.

589
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,192
And so are you.

590
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,516
Doris, show the gentlemen out.

591
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,990
It's all right, thank you. We can
find our own way downstairs.

592
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,477
Freddie.

593
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,950
Mavis, go to the kitchen
and get yourself some tea.

594
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,078
- I'll ring when I need you.
- Yes. Thank you, madam.

595
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,348
- Darling, where is Jonathan?
- Friends may be hiding him.

596
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,714
He had no friends, only me.

597
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,917
I hope he hasn't made any and hasn't
taken them into his confidence.

598
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,799
- For your sake, his sake and their sake.
- What do you mean?

599
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,916
If the truth comes out,
it would break you.

600
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,911
- I can't have that.
- What could you do?

601
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,117
You know me.
You know how it is with me.

602
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,674
- You make me afraid.
- Not I. You don't know what fear is.

603
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,873
Oh, that would be most lovely.

604
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,837
Of course,
you must be fond of swimming.

605
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,877
But I am, yes I am,
very fond of it.

606
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,871
I go out to the country
to find somewhere to swim.

607
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,951
You don't live in the country? Oh, dear.

608
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:10,318
We miss the rain so much, don't we?
All the flowers. It's so disappointing.

609
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,113
I really must apologize for Eve, Mr...?

610
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,510
- Was the name Smith?
- Smith, yes.

611
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,399
Smith.
The name seems familiar, somehow.

612
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,438
I can't understand
why that girl is so late.

613
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,716
I mean, she's usually so punctual.

614
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,075
She takes that from me.
Her father isn't punctual.

615
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,118
He catches trains and things,
but always at the last moment.

616
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,872
I'm there at least an hour before.

617
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,952
Yes. I'm sure you are.
I have heard a lot about you, Mrs. Gill.

618
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,157
Oh, have you? Is Eve very fond of me?

619
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,950
Have you known her long, Mr. Smith?
I've got the name right now, haven't I?

620
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,315
I've known her
for about a day and a half.

621
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,355
That's not very long.

622
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,714
Where did you meet?

623
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,031
As a matter of fact,
we met in the saloon bar of a pub.

624
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,633
Well.

625
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,677
How interesting.

626
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,109
Thank you.

627
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,030
- Am I intruding?
- This is Mr. Smith.

628
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,078
Mr. Smith, this is Eve's father.
We see him now and again.

629
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,038
- How do you do, sir?
- Very well, indeed. Thank you.

630
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,111
- Do sit down.
- Thank you.

631
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,710
- Where's Eve?
- She should be here by this time.

632
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,108
She asked Mr. Smith to tea.

633
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,952
Oh, good, good.
Anyone else coming?

634
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,429
I mean, going to be a party?
I am fond of parties.

635
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,068
No. There's no one else coming,
and you weren't invited.

636
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,276
Wasn't I? Oh, an oversight.

637
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,759
But I forgive you.

638
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,514
Forgiveness, Mr. Smith.
The secret of a happy married life.

639
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,116
That and long stretches of the absence
that makes the heart grow fonder.

640
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,716
There you are, my dear.
The last but four of the Mahicans.

641
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,711
- Will you forgive me, Mr. Ordinary Smith?
- Yes. I've just been set an example.

642
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,075
Yes, but he says his name
is just plain Smith.

643
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,037
He did? I'm terribly sorry to be late...

644
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,317
...but the rehearsal went on and
the awful part is, I have to go back.

645
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,199
- It was decent of you to have come.
- What are you doing here?

646
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,033
- I've been trying to reach you all day.
- I took the boat out.

647
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,997
We had quite a little cruise.

648
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,151
Jonnie and me.

649
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,271
Poor old Jonnie.
I hope his rheumatism is better.

650
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,396
Do play something, Mr. Smith.
Mr. Smith is a pianist, Mother.

651
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,437
Well, I think that's a delightful career.

652
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:16,355
- I often wish I'd kept up my practicing.
- It's not exactly my career, Mrs. Gill.

653
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,431
But you must play for us.
Make him, Mother.

654
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,272
But I haven't even started my tea yet.

655
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,670
But of course he hasn't.
Eve, you are ridiculous.

656
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,758
But I've got to leave in a minute.
Please play.

657
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,232
You know, Jonnie's not
much of a sailor, Eve.

658
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,278
He was abominably seasick.

659
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,399
In fact, as soon as we got ashore,
Jonnie ran away.

660
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,949
- Who's Jonnie?
- I wish I knew.

661
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,680
He's about 57 different varieties.

662
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,515
Roughly speaking, he was a dog of some
sort that strayed in a few nights ago.

663
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:48,036
- Do the police know about him?
- No, no. I'm not worried about him.

664
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,668
I daresay he'll find his way
back to his old master.

665
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,193
Or mistress.

666
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,920
I thought we might have to ask
for your help, Mr. Smith.

667
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,594
Mr. Smith is a detective, Mother.

668
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,273
Mrs. Mason.

669
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,509
A detective. How very unusual.

670
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,671
I suppose you have
many fascinating cases.

671
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,832
- Must be very exciting.
- Not very, I'm afraid.

672
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,310
- Embezzlement, fraud, petty thefts.
- Smuggling?

673
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,152
Yes. Occasionally. Brandy mostly.

674
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,357
Murder, too, sometimes, Father.

675
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,034
Mr. Smith is working
on the Inwood case.

676
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,632
Oh, you don't say so.
Yes, I read about that somewhere.

677
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,877
How did you know?

678
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,989
I saw your photograph in the paper.

679
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,635
What is the fellow's name, Clippen.

680
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,711
Cooper, Cooper.
Did he do it, do you think?

681
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,598
He has run away and remained in hiding.

682
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,832
We're inclined to accept the obvious
as being obvious.

683
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,349
Oh, it's just like Sherlock Holmes
and his fiddle.

684
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:03,548
A stream of beautiful sound,
and then suddenly out pops the solution.

685
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,358
- Oh, I must run.
- So must I.

686
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,512
- I don't know what you'll think of me.
- I like people bound up in their work.

687
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,399
- You'll make a very good actress indeed.
- <i>Au revoir,</i> my pet.

688
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,313
Meet me at the stage door...

689
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,910
- Can't I drive you back to the Academy?
- No. I want you to get to know Father.

690
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,469
Not professionally,
but he's a wonderful character.

691
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,393
- They'd be hurt if you didn't stay.
- When will I see you again?

692
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:41,553
- Well, I really don't...
- Ring me tomorrow. Regent 1113.

693
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,955
I know you think I'm an idiot,
but I'm not. I'm doing darn well.

694
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,509
Yes. You're giving a very good show.
A very good show.

695
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,877
- Pity you've no audience.
- But you're my audience.

696
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,600
I wish you'd give me a little
applause now and then.

697
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,638
- I wonder when Jonathan will turn up.
- Turn up where?

698
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,916
Wherever Miss Charlotte Inwood
happens to be.

699
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,911
Good heavens, she'll only turn him over.

700
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,516
Yes, and to your nice new friend,
Mr. Smith.

701
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,312
Who was that man?

702
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,596
Oh, that was my dad, madam.

703
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,399
I told him about my temporary job,
and he doesn't like it.

704
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,676
What with the murder and all.
You know, madam.

705
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,229
What's it got to do with him?
Or with you?

706
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,597
My dad says that man on the run
might turn up here.

707
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,830
Might even get into the dressing room.

708
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,752
Might even murder me, madam.

709
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,117
It's the scene of the crime the murderer
returns to, not the theater.

710
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,918
He might be right, my dad.

711
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,435
I'm surprised you're not
a bit afraid yourself.

712
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,399
Slippers.

713
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,949
This theater's the last place
he'd want to be seen in.

714
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,350
Now, stop acting like a silly schoolgirl.

715
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,830
The only murderer here
is the orchestra leader.

716
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,671
Father, you've got to keep
on the lookout and head Jonathan off.

717
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,796
Right. Certainly, my dear.

718
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,269
This is desperate.

719
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,473
Go on, go on, go on.

720
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,389
Madam, madam.

721
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,118
- What?
- Madam, there's a man.

722
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,470
- He's gone up to your dressing room.
- What are you talking about? What man?

723
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,995
I saw him. Don't go up there.
It's dangerous.

724
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,912
You're an imbecile.

725
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,957
You needn't come up.

726
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,918
I'll manage to change myself.

727
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,748
I know, Jonnie, darling,
but what a terrible risk you've taken.

728
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,798
- I couldn't keep away.
- You haven't told me where you've been.

729
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,155
Some friends looked after me.

730
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,117
- What friends?
- Never mind that just now.

731
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,111
We've got to work out
a plan of campaign.

732
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,113
- Everything is going on beautifully.
- We've got to get a story...

733
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,670
...and we'll both have to stick to it.
- I must change.

734
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,676
You shouldn't have come here, Jonnie.
You have been so wonderful up to now.

735
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,400
Don't think that I'm ungrateful.
I'm not. Truly, I'm not.

736
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,515
- I don't know how I shall ever repay you.
- Repay me?

737
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,158
You talk as though this were a favor.

738
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,320
Something that a "thank you"
can take care of.

739
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:33,268
Dearest, you mustn't be foolish.
You must go away at once. Back to...

740
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,032
...where you were hiding.

741
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,634
Freddie's going to get you
out of the country soon.

742
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,439
And I'll come to see you,
when the run of the show's over.

743
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,990
Why, that may be months,
maybe a year, or more.

744
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,470
Well, you know how it is. We were
playing to capacity before this happened.

745
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,517
Now they're hanging on
to the chandeliers.

746
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,238
Fifty pounds up tonight.

747
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,516
Goodness knows
how they squeeze them in.

748
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,468
Yes. I could only get standing room.

749
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,070
Well, there you are.

750
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,790
We'll find a lovely place,
South America or somewhere.

751
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,434
And I'll come out to you, as soon
as all of this has blown over.

752
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,350
I'll be glad of the rest for a week or two.

753
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,638
Palm trees...

754
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,358
...sunshine.

755
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,794
Lovely.

756
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,192
A week or two?

757
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,432
Well, you don't want me to give up
everything, do you?

758
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,079
Why not? I have.

759
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:32,159
Now, Jonnie, I thought you said that
my happiness was all that mattered...

760
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,630
...and you must admit that
you behaved as if it was.

761
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,474
Taking all the trouble
to protect my reputation...

762
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,198
...covering up the accident...

763
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,397
...destroying that dreadful dress
with the bloodstain on it.

764
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,118
I didn't destroy it.

765
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,394
You didn't?

766
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,830
Jonnie, you promised.

767
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,070
Don't you realize
if they find the dress...

768
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,799
So long as I have that dress, I'm the one
who decides how long this show will run.

769
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,348
And everything else.

770
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,354
Do you understand?

771
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,398
Where the devil is Miss Inwood?
The orchestra's started her number.

772
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,869
My socks and suspenders, where is she?

773
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,235
Take this. I'll change downstairs.

774
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,391
Sorry, darling. A hook broke.

775
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,559
Just a minute, Charlie.
Jonathan Cooper's in the theater.

776
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,393
The sergeant's seen him.
He was sure to make for your room.

777
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:31,030
- Have you seen him?
- Of course not. What a stupid idea.

778
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,430
I think I better take a look
at your dressing room.

779
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,512
Doris, show Sergeant Loomis
where to go.

780
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,478
- Freddie, there's something...
- Miss Inwood, please.

781
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,197
Doris, what are you waiting for?

782
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,949
Oh, Mr. Loomis, I feel so queer.
It's my heart.

783
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,509
The doctor told me I should
take the stairs easy.

784
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,114
You don't think he'll try to shoot
his way out, do you?

785
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,748
He might be desperate, sergeant.

786
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,397
Don't you think you ought
to go back and get a policeman?

787
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,633
She was glad he got away, Father.

788
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,234
- How do you know?
- By a look she gave Freddie Williams.

789
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,078
"Look she gave"?
That won't get you far.

790
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,993
She'd be more delighted if she knew
there was no stained dress.

791
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,354
Oh, yes.

792
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,478
- I wish we still had that dress.
- There's so very little time.

793
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,154
We've got to make every minute count.

794
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,833
I have to phone Smith tomorrow.

795
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,719
Why don't I invite him to the theatrical
garden party with me?

796
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,075
I have to sell programs there.

797
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,911
- I don't quite follow you, my dear Holmes.
- In order to make him see.

798
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,470
Nobody suspects our Charlotte yet,
and they've got to.

799
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,792
First, you'd see my mother and father
and get approved by them.

800
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,758
Most parents nowadays don't seem
to care what sort of people...

801
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,276
...their children go around with,
but I'm not like that.

802
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,830
I know I'm very old-fashioned,
but I've got to think of Eve.

803
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,230
What do you do for a living?

804
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,593
I write a bit.

805
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,637
What, novels and things?

806
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,236
I'm very fond of novels. You know,
I read a delightful one the other day.

807
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,073
Let me see. What was the title?
It was written by that woman.

808
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,595
I can't remember, but she's written
a number of books.

809
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,070
You must have read some of them.
They're all about charming people.

810
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,276
She only writes
about the nice side of life.

811
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,237
Now, this book I was telling you about...

812
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,834
...the title has just slipped
my memory for the moment.

813
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,992
Well, it's about a mother, which is
a nice idea, I think, don't you?

814
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,276
One reads so much
about the younger generation.

815
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,476
It does seem a brilliant idea
to have a change.

816
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,959
Now, this mother isn't old...

817
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,279
I'm sorry to turn up so late,
but I'm stranded for the night.

818
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,830
All the hotels are full.
My flat's uninhabitable.

819
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,276
I told you, it's in the hands
of the decorators.

820
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,078
I know it's a frightful imposition...

821
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,073
...but I wondered if you could
give me a shakedown somewhere?

822
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,719
Well, of course we can.

823
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,154
Can't we, Mother?

824
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:28,198
Well, it's a little awkward.

825
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,949
Is your father proposing
to stay here too?

826
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,635
Well, Jonathan could have my room,
and I could sleep on the settee.

827
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,791
Where shall we put your father?

828
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,869
No. I'll sleep on the settee,
and you can sleep with your mama.

829
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:47,192
- I hate to put you to all this trouble.
- Not at all, Mr...? What is your name?

830
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,599
- Jones.
- Brown.

831
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,558
Robinson. Now, Mr. Robinson,
I think we'll make it bye-byes.

832
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,632
A blanket for the commodore,
and we'll all go to bye-byes.

833
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,712
Robinson. I've heard that name before.

834
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:06,279
It won't do. Has Eve gone mad, turning
the house into a hotel in the night?

835
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,193
Who is this man, anyway?
What is his name?

836
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,237
Well, perhaps you better not mention it.

837
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,868
The fact is that he's
a fugitive from justice.

838
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,270
The whole police force is on his heels,
and Eve...

839
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,512
Well, for reasons of her own, my dear,
doesn't want him to be caught.

840
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,113
He's...

841
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,590
He's wanted for murder.

842
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,115
Now you're going too far.

843
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,830
I suppose you think I believed that
that Mr. Smith, who came here to tea...

844
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,672
...was a real detective.

845
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,955
If I hadn't heard her maid's voice outside
the dressing room, they'd have got me.

846
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,839
Eve, darling, I know I should
never have trusted her.

847
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,675
Darling, you've been wonderful to me.
I don't deserve it, but I need you.

848
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,952
I need you more than ever.

849
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,190
Tonight, when I found
what Charlotte was...

850
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,669
...all of a sudden,
I thought my brain would burst.

851
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,558
After all that I'd done for her.

852
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,951
Everything I did for her was because
I loved her and she loved me.

853
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,955
- I'm so sorry.
- Why the umbrella?

854
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,475
It is a garden party, isn't it?

855
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,154
Oh, Roehampton Club, please.

856
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:34,478
It couldn't be helped, I'm afraid.
You must blame a Miss Doris Tinsdale.

857
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,154
Who is Doris Tinsdale?

858
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:41,677
She's Charlotte Inwood's temporary
dresser. We've been searching for her.

859
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,432
One of our men at the theater...

860
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,876
...let her slip through his fingers
without making a statement.

861
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,871
You look very lovely.

862
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,354
You're very sweet to say so.

863
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:56,517
What has this Doris Tinsdale person
got to do with the case?

864
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,193
Or shouldn't I ask, Mr. Smith?

865
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,750
Well, Cooper was at the theater
last night, and we think she saw him.

866
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,435
And don't call me Mr. Smith.
After all, my name is...

867
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,079
Wilfred.

868
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,392
Not very good, is it?

869
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:12,074
It suits some people very nicely.

870
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:15,717
I rather liked it when you called me
"Ordinary Smith."

871
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:19,236
- Oh, I didn't mean to, really.
- But I liked it. I liked it very much.

872
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,630
Please go on calling me that, will you?

873
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,590
Yes, I will.

874
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,071
What were we talking about?

875
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:33,634
Oh, yes. I was going to ask you, why did
Cooper risk going to the theater?

876
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:37,156
He must have had a very strong reason
for wanting to talk to Miss Inwood.

877
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:41,359
- Let's not talk shop on a day like this.
- Oh, I am sorry.

878
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,317
Do you hate inquisitive people?

879
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,871
Of course not. I'm one myself.

880
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:49,271
But seriously, Ordinary...

881
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,870
...do you think there's anything
between Cooper and Miss Inwood?

882
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:57,834
Seriously, "Extraordinary,"
I shouldn't be a bit surprised.

883
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:04,393
What a curious person she must be.

884
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:09,795
I mean, going back on the stage
so soon after everything.

885
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:11,548
The show must go on.

886
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:15,759
A smiling face, a breaking heart.
Actors rather like it, I'm told.

887
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,918
But today...

888
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,958
...going right from the funeral
to the garden party.

889
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,239
I must say, I think that's
overdoing things a bit.

890
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,517
A strong sense of the dramatics
and all that sort of thing.

891
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,072
It's...

892
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,479
...so cold and calculating of her.

893
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,513
Is it?

894
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,077
Yes, it is.

895
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:47,118
If she's that cold and calculating,
I was wondering...

896
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,670
...maybe she had something to do
with her husband's death.

897
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,233
Were you?

898
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,113
After all...

899
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,919
...there must be a lot
that doesn't appear on the surface.

900
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,233
I mean, like...

901
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,709
...wheels within wheels.

902
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:09,075
Who...? Who knows what goes on
in a woman's mind?

903
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,993
I don't know.

904
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,440
And if I don't know, I...

905
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,033
Well...

906
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,238
...who?

907
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,551
A woman's mind sometimes...

908
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,117
I was saying that a woman's mind...

909
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,958
That's right.

910
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,633
Do you really?

911
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,718
I think so too.

912
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,915
In Miss Inwood's case?

913
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,354
What?

914
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,434
What?

915
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:14,517
I have to report to the committee tent
to get my programs.

916
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,873
- <i>whether to give it to the orphans</i>
<i>or to let the government take it.</i>

917
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,031
<i>I'm putting it to you!</i>

918
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,918
There's the committee tent over there.

919
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:26,277
You do understand I won't be able
to spend the whole afternoon with you?

920
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:29,796
Can't I go with you? I can sell a mean
program. We bloodhounds have methods.

921
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,633
But you must go and amuse yourself.
I can't take you with me.

922
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:36,110
Every time I begin to think I know
what color your eyes are, you disappear.

923
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:40,159
But it's against the rules. Now please go.
I'll pick you up later. I'll get in trouble.

924
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:44,677
<i>Right here. Step right up.</i>
<i>Yes, madam. Over here...</i>

925
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,355
Eve, you brute. Wherever
have you been? You're hours late.

926
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:51,080
- I'm sorry, Chubby.
- What a day. What a day.

927
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:52,673
- Hello, Valerie.
- Hello, Eve.

928
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:55,718
Oh, this is Wilfred Smith.
Chubby Bannister and Valerie Maynard.

929
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,279
They're at RADA with me.

930
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,193
- Well, how do you do, Mr. Smith?
- How do you do?

931
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,874
I'm sure you'd love some ice cream.
Chubby could show you where it is.

932
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,190
- Oh, but I'd adore to.
- That's most good of you.

933
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,909
I hope you'll remember me by this little
token of my regard and esteem.

934
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,074
Allow me.

935
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:15,392
<i>As you know, this fete is being held</i>
<i>for the aid of the Actors' Orphanage.</i>

936
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:19,030
<i>Now, it's raining outside, and if you've</i>
<i>got half a pound to spare, come in...</i>

937
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,428
Which programs shall I take?

938
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,750
- Take that pile, dear.
- Thank you.

939
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:36,069
You newspaperwomen work hard
at your job, don't you, Miss Gill?

940
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,514
How did you know my name?

941
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:39,716
Called that number you gave me
for emergency.

942
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:43,429
A Mrs. Gill answered,
and I put two and two together.

943
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,831
- What did you need me for in such hurry?
- Don't talk to me like that.

944
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,798
I've come down here to tell you
Miss Inwood's looking for you.

945
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:52,872
- What does she want?
- She wants your head, of course.

946
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,396
What's more, she said the police want
to talk to a Miss Doris Tinsdale.

947
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,869
She wants to know when I'm going
back to my work.

948
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,110
I told her my stomach
was still out of order.

949
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,679
Well, it's better now.

950
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,877
- Much better, thank you.
- You want more money, don't you?

951
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:10,272
Look at the risk I'm running. I'd better go
to Miss Inwood and tell her everything.

952
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:14,149
And before that detective finds out
there's no such person as Doris.

953
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,470
Here's 5 pounds. It's all I have with me.

954
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,512
Oh, my job's worth more than that,
at least another 20.

955
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:25,036
I'll meet you outside Miss Inwood's tent
in half an hour.

956
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,035
Finished already? You are doing well.

957
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:35,351
- May I use your phone?
- Why, yes, of course, my dear. There it is.

958
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,033
Thank you.

959
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,479
Hello. Is that you, Father?

960
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:49,155
Could you come right away? With all
the money you can lay your hands on.

961
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,470
At least 20 pounds. At least!

962
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,313
It's Nellie.

963
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,835
The girl I'm understudying.

964
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,991
Yes. Be quick, darling.

965
01:11:58,720 --> 01:11:59,596
<i>No queuing.</i>

966
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,990
<i>No queuing here.</i>
<i>Step right up.</i>

967
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:05,436
<i>Yes, madam, over here...</i>

968
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,717
Doris, isn't it?

969
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,512
Yes, sir.

970
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:17,270
Yes, sir. I took your advice, sir.
I done myself up.

971
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,590
I mean, what do you think of it?

972
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,115
- Where have you been?
- Oh, I can explain it, sir.

973
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,953
- Only yesterday...
- Come along. I'll take you to Miss Inwood.

974
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,917
Come on, hurry.

975
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:33,193
<i>Roll up, roll up, roll up. Come and have</i>
<i>a good time. Come on, sir. You, sir...</i>

976
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,313
Miss Tinsdale to see you.

977
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:40,631
Well, this is a pleasure. Where have
you been? I thought you were dead.

978
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,429
Oh, no, madam. I wasn't.
As a matter of fact...

979
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:48,639
Don't go into detail. I hope you're not
becoming one of those explicit people...

980
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,553
...who always tell you exactly
how they feel when you ask them.

981
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,790
You did leave me a trifle suspended,
however.

982
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,632
I'm sorry, madam.

983
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,313
I was held up.

984
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,032
Darling!

985
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,998
Whatever happened to that
peculiar figure of yours?

986
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,273
It's a new dress, madam.

987
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,032
Keep it, dear.

988
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,236
What it does for you is worth thousands.

989
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,799
I bought it at a sale.

990
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,793
Don't confide in me.
Just pour some tea, would you?

991
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,311
By the way, Doris...

992
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,517
...did Nellie tell you the police
want to talk to you?

993
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,910
But whatever for, madam?

994
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,071
Oh, I hope they won't upset my dad.

995
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,913
- My dad said...
- They're not going to eat you, darling.

996
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,914
It's not important. Just pull yourself
together and pour the tea.

997
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,153
Rehearsals from morning till night.
If we wanted to misbehave...

998
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,629
...we couldn't find a minute to do it in.
- No.

999
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,110
Yes, so I understand. Eve tells me
she kept hard at it all day and evening.

1000
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,955
But Eve hasn't been near for days.
I thought she was home with a cold.

1001
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,998
- Maybe she's got a job in a show.
- Gosh.

1002
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:57,835
<i>A fortune in five minutes,</i>
<i>and there's no income tax on it tonight.</i>

1003
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,268
Excuse me, madam. I've...

1004
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,396
I've got to sneeze.

1005
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,675
- Miss Livingston, I presume.
- That's not my name.

1006
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:45,435
Oh, no, no. It's Nellie Goode, isn't it?
But what does the name matter?

1007
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,797
After all, I could think of lots of much
more appropriate names for you.

1008
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,349
Yes, I could think of a few for you too.
Who are you?

1009
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:56,116
I understand my daughter has entered
into a somewhat shady transaction.

1010
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:59,875
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Well, you are a blackmailer, aren't you?

1011
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,600
You know, that's a very,
very naughty thing to be.

1012
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:06,275
Don't say things like that to me.
You could be had up for a thing like that.

1013
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:07,759
Now, don't be so peppery.

1014
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,071
- I like to keep things on a friendly basis.
- One short.

1015
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,470
It's all I've got. You don't want
me to walk home...

1016
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,596
I don't care if you crawl home.

1017
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:20,197
Well, it doesn't matter. I'm not mean.
And you've got till tomorrow morning.

1018
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,878
Father, Freddie Williams, Charlotte's
manager, spotted me as Doris.

1019
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:26,315
I had to go into Charlotte's tent.

1020
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,914
If there's one thing I hate,
it's saying I told you so.

1021
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,277
And the police want to talk to Doris.
I don't know which way to turn.

1022
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,874
I think I'll get Smith
and tell him the whole story.

1023
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,156
Have you got him to suspect
Charlotte yet?

1024
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:38,999
I'm afraid not.

1025
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,708
But I thought you had to pick him up at
Whitehall. Didn't you talk to him about it?

1026
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,431
But, yes, I did...

1027
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,752
...in a way.

1028
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,558
In a way?

1029
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,756
Oh, I see.

1030
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:57,515
Some more important topic arose
in the conversation.

1031
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,831
Only there's one slight complication,
my dear: Jonathan.

1032
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,231
You're not, by any chance, thinking
of changing horses in midstream?

1033
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,436
Father, is it awful of me?

1034
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,160
Not awful, my dear,
just rather a bad bit of timing.

1035
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,356
No matter how my feelings
toward him change...

1036
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,670
...I still can't let Jonathan down, can I?

1037
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,274
Not while he's hiding in our house.

1038
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:31,994
Call yourself an actress? There's your
big scene, if you have the pluck to take it.

1039
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:35,835
You have the law on your arm. All you
have to do is rush in and shout, "Stop!

1040
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,718
That woman is a murderess!"

1041
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:41,395
And then she'll say, "How dare you?"
And you'll say, "I'll dare and dare again.

1042
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:45,269
What about the bloodstained dress,
eh, Miss Charlotte Inwood?"

1043
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:49,035
- And then she'll say...
- Please. This is serious, Father.

1044
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:52,192
- Oh, Eve! There you are.
- I couldn't find you anywhere.

1045
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:56,831
- I'm trying to get rid of my programs.
- I've been too busy talking to sell mine.

1046
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,433
Do you think I talk too much?

1047
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,318
No. Most women don't talk enough.

1048
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:04,109
- I hate shy women.
- No one could ever call me shy...

1049
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,510
Who'll come over to shoot
some lovely ducks?

1050
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:31,956
It will only cost you half a crown,
and it does such good for the orphans.

1051
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:35,317
Who'll come and shoot lovely ducks
here for half a crown?

1052
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:38,472
Only half a crown to shoot lovely ducks!

1053
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,639
Eve.

1054
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,197
Excuse me.

1055
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,474
Look, Eve, hold everything.
I have an idea.

1056
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:55,952
Get Smith into Charlotte's tent,
as near the front as you can.

1057
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:58,236
Go on, quickly.

1058
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,754
- What do you say we hear Charlotte sing?
- Oh, do let's.

1059
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,798
The murder makes her so interesting.

1060
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:10,117
- You know, I think I'll wait outside.
- But you promised.

1061
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:13,234
- I promised?
- In the taxi.

1062
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,472
You said the first thing we'd do
would be to go hear Charlotte Inwood.

1063
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,153
Don't you remember?

1064
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,191
Do you know? I can't remember.

1065
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,510
I must have had some sort of a blackout.

1066
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,957
- Oh, do let's hurry. We'll miss her.
- I think she's just dreamy.

1067
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,998
Only half a crown to shoot a lovely duck!

1068
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,310
You can win a lovely prize!
Heavenly prizes!

1069
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,869
Only half a crown to shoot...
Would you like to shoot?

1070
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:39,112
No, no. I hate firearms. I wonder
if I could buy one of those dolls.

1071
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:40,474
- A doll?
- Yes, please.

1072
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,312
- Which doll?
- Oh, any doll. That doll.

1073
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,790
- I suppose, but you'll have to pay for it.
- I know, but how much, please?

1074
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,633
- Well, it's for the orphans.
- Yes, I know, but how much?

1075
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,270
- You are sorry for them, aren't you?
- Of course I am, but how much?

1076
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:55,318
We all are, aren't we? Well, I suppose...

1077
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,436
...at least four pounds.

1078
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,948
- Give me the gun.
- Well, half a crown, then.

1079
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:05,237
- Yes.
- You know. Money first.

1080
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,231
- Now, shall I put it in for you?
- Yes, please.

1081
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,356
It breaks somewhere here. I can't...

1082
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,398
It's rather...

1083
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,357
Perhaps I can manage.

1084
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:20,035
Wait a minute. I think you'll have to do
it yourself. I'm not frightfully good.

1085
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,714
Be rather careful, won't you?
You know, it goes off.

1086
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:29,711
Got you again, my beauty.

1087
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,871
My bird, I think, sir.

1088
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,359
Could I have the doll, please?

1089
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,397
What did you say?

1090
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:38,954
Good shot, sir.

1091
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,675
Well done. I'll get you your doll.

1092
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:47,118
Here you are, sir. Now, then,
who's going to shoot lovely ducks?

1093
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,157
Would you like to shoot lovely ducks?

1094
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,675
- Yes. Half a crown's worth.
- You sure that's enough?

1095
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:55,753
Oh, yes, certainly. Yes, I don't need
any more. I very seldom miss.

1096
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,355
Oh, got it at last. Could I have
the doll, please?

1097
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:09,353
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm afraid that's mine.

1098
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,158
What did you say?

1099
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,356
Nothing at all.

1100
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:17,590
- Could I have the doll, please?
- Well done. I'll go and get it for you.

1101
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,228
It is rather nice, I think,
to have won it, don't you?

1102
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:24,188
You did earn it that time. They're lovely
dolls. They're fully dressed. Fully.

1103
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:25,759
Thank you very much.

1104
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,595
Who's going to come and shoot lovely
duck over here for only half a crown?

1105
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,435
We're having such fun over here
shooting duck for only half a crown!

1106
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,114
Eve.

1107
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,589
Eve.

1108
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,074
I'm sorry.

1109
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,152
Ladies and gentlemen.

1110
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,111
Doris. Doris!

1111
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,998
Miss Tinsdale!

1112
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,548
Come and give a hand here.

1113
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,358
What are you waiting for?

1114
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,552
I'm sorry, sir.

1115
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:43,917
<i>Do you think there's anything between</i>
<i>Cooper and Miss Inwood?</i>

1116
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,116
<i>But Eve hasn't been near for days.</i>

1117
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,032
<i>Doris! Miss Tinsdale!</i>

1118
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,909
We got away as quickly as possible,
and here we are.

1119
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:54,868
And that's the story of the short
and stormy life of Doris Tinsdale.

1120
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,315
It is in many respects a sad one,
but, one hopes...

1121
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:59,789
...not entirely without usefulness.

1122
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:02,872
The next thing is to wait
for the arrival of Mr. Ordinary Smith...

1123
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,600
...with his posse to arrest
the whole boiling lot of us.

1124
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,752
Well, you think I should give myself up,
is that it?

1125
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:12,789
Yes, I should, shouldn't I? The longer
I stay here, the worse it will be for you.

1126
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:16,350
But I won't give up. There must be
a way to get at Charlotte.

1127
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:20,149
Now, I've made a nice hot toddy
for you, Mr. Robinson.

1128
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,629
There's nothing like it for a cold,
is there?

1129
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,153
Thank you.

1130
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:28,513
Isn't it dreadful? Mr. Robinson hasn't been
able to stir out of his room since he came.

1131
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:30,591
These spring colds are really frightful.

1132
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:34,275
Oh, by the way, Eve, Mr. Smith
is downstairs and wants to see you.

1133
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:36,192
I think it would be such a good idea...

1134
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:39,716
...if I made Mr. Robinson a nice,
hot mustard plaster.

1135
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,791
I wonder if he's got a temperature.

1136
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:45,396
I've broken my thermometer, but you
could easily run to the chemist's...

1137
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,914
How long have you been
Miss Inwood's maid?

1138
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,355
As I think you know, we've been anxious
to ask Doris Tinsdale a few questions.

1139
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:12,876
- I can explain...
- You talk to Jonathan Cooper last night?

1140
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,117
- No.
- Did you see him?

1141
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,234
- Yes.
- Where?

1142
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,516
On his way
to Miss Inwood's dressing room.

1143
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:23,148
He was there
when she went up to change.

1144
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:26,118
I listened at the door and overheard
him say something about...

1145
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,794
...a bloodstained dress belonging to her.

1146
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,315
And then suddenly, she became afraid.

1147
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:33,471
Do you hear? Afraid.

1148
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,030
When you took Sergeant Loomis
up to the room...

1149
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,270
...you presumed Cooper to be still there?

1150
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,238
Well, I didn't know.

1151
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,709
No, you didn't know,
but you had a pretty fair idea.

1152
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,552
Why didn't you tell Loomis?

1153
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:50,036
Then you did a very neat fainting fit,
which allowed Cooper to get clear away.

1154
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,030
Don't talk like that.

1155
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,350
I can't bear it.

1156
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,996
I don't understand it.

1157
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:08,116
- How could you behave like that?
- But I can explain.

1158
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,558
I don't think that's necessary.

1159
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:14,599
In my job, I find a woman goes to almost
any length to protect her lover.

1160
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,358
But it's not like that.

1161
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,317
It's not like that at all.

1162
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,789
I thought I was in love with Jonathan...

1163
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:22,678
...but I'm not anymore.

1164
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,230
But it doesn't mean I won't go on helping
him, as I would any innocent man.

1165
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:31,154
It's not for you to decide whether he's
innocent or not. Leave that to the law.

1166
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:33,470
The point is, you put yourself
and your father...

1167
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:36,791
...in a very serious position
by this infernal amateur meddling.

1168
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,514
How I'm going to get you out of it,
I don't know.

1169
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,552
But you do want to get us out?

1170
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:47,833
In spite of the fact you made such
a fool of me, you mean.

1171
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,554
Your acting in the taxi
was extremely clever.

1172
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:58,470
I wasn't acting in the taxi.

1173
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:03,708
I fell in love with someone,
and all my plans went out the window.

1174
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:09,750
When we were in the taxi together, I felt
as though I were on a great golden cloud.

1175
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:14,957
I told Father I didn't want to go on with
this. I wanted to tell you everything.

1176
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:19,079
But he had an idea about a
bloodstained doll, and I had to put it off.

1177
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:22,270
I wanted to tell you all about it.

1178
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,757
Please believe me.

1179
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:30,518
Would you like to mix a cocktail
yourself, Mr. Smith?

1180
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:34,468
I'm afraid there's no ice,
but I'm sure you can manage.

1181
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:38,510
- Good evening, Smith.
- Good evening.

1182
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,713
- Do I hear the muted clanking of chains?
- It's only the plumbing.

1183
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:43,472
It's in a dreadful state.

1184
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,631
How did you enjoy the garden party,
Mr. Smith?

1185
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,916
It must have been awful in that rain.

1186
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:51,436
I think I'll take some sherry
up to Mr. Robinson.

1187
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,195
I've quite changed my mind about him.
He seems such a nice young man after all.

1188
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:58,557
Eve, dear, you will look after
Mr. Smith, won't you?

1189
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:04,195
Father, I've been explaining to Mr. Smith
what we're trying to do.

1190
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,316
He thinks we ought to stop.

1191
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,198
Oh, what a pity.

1192
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:11,796
Just when you and I were about to save
Mr. Smith so much trouble.

1193
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,596
Save me trouble?

1194
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:17,991
Sir, you don't look like an irresponsible
imbecile. Why behave like one?

1195
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:22,438
You let your daughter get mixed up
in this? What sort of father are you?

1196
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,909
Unique. Quite unique.

1197
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:28,675
But rather broken-hearted at this
moment. You see, I have another idea.

1198
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:31,274
A pity to waste ideas, isn't it?

1199
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:35,915
Have you...? Have you ever
been blackmailed, Mr. Smith?

1200
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,389
Well, I have. Only this afternoon.

1201
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,994
At least my daughter and I were,
by Nellie Goode.

1202
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:44,197
Yes, most inappropriate name.
I told her so.

1203
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:47,955
She touched us for 24 pounds, and do
you know why I think it was well-spent?

1204
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:51,717
- Though we could ill afford it.
- Come to the point, please.

1205
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:55,873
Well, it struck me that
what Nellie could do, Doris could do.

1206
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:58,110
I mean suppose she went
to Miss Inwood and said:

1207
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:01,158
"Look, Miss Inwood,
I've got a certain dress of yours.

1208
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:04,551
It's ruined, but it's still worth money."

1209
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:09,790
And suppose Miss Inwood said, "All
right, I'll give you 100 pounds for it."

1210
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,279
What then, eh?

1211
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:15,069
And suppose you happened
to be listening.

1212
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:18,596
Well, that's what police do
in blackmail cases, isn't it?

1213
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:20,830
What about it, eh? What about it?

1214
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,788
You needn't be afraid that Doris couldn't
do it. She could do it, Doris could.

1215
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,873
I mean, Eve could. She's a very good
actress, a very good actress indeed.

1216
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,632
I'm sure she is.

1217
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:36,113
By the way,
is there a bloodstained dress?

1218
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:40,194
Well, no. No, not exactly.

1219
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:43,796
Look, there was
a bloodstained dress, only...

1220
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:46,474
- Couldn't we tell you...?
- I'm getting back to the office.

1221
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:48,676
I'll let you know about this later.

1222
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:55,033
In the meantime, what's Miss Inwood
doing without a dresser?

1223
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:58,749
You better run along to the theater
before she starts getting impatient.

1224
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:02,949
It's all right.

1225
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:05,953
- What do you mean, "It's all right"?
- He's trying to save face.

1226
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:07,348
Not a bad face, either.

1227
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:10,557
He'll let us do it. What's the matter
with you? Aren't you pleased?

1228
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,830
Come on. We better hurry.

1229
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:16,237
Come to Burton Street
and bring two men.

1230
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:17,958
Post them at either ends of the street.

1231
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:21,476
I'll be waiting at the telephone booth
at the corner. All right?

1232
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:43,433
Hello. Is that Mrs. Gill?
Is the commodore available?

1233
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,751
Oh, he's gone out. Is Miss Eve there?

1234
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:49,480
Oh, she's out too. No, one moment.

1235
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:52,393
May I speak to Mr. Robinson, please?

1236
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:12,839
- What's your idea, governor?
- Just a little experiment.

1237
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,355
- Plug it in.
- Okay.

1238
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:31,631
<i>The mike's in position.</i>

1239
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:35,156
<i>I'm speaking about three foot from it.</i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1240
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:39,080
- Tell him the sound's all right.
- Okay.

1241
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:43,676
Do you think it'll work?

1242
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:45,273
What a day, darling.

1243
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:48,238
I've never in my whole life been so glad
to see the end of it.

1244
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,595
- Yes, madam.
- You must be tired too.

1245
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:53,320
It can't be easy to be a dresser
with no experience.

1246
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:56,677
But you're quite good.
Very good, indeed.

1247
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:00,196
Oh, that rain.
That rain at the garden party.

1248
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:03,716
Thank goodness it didn't rain at the
funeral. That would have been too much.

1249
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:06,030
I hate rainy funerals.

1250
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,834
And then somebody sent up
that disgusting doll.

1251
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:12,554
What vermin some vermin are.

1252
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,199
Yes, madam.

1253
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,909
By the way, did the police find you?

1254
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:18,877
I haven't seen them yet, madam.

1255
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:21,156
And anyway,
I've got nothing to tell them.

1256
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:22,912
Well, I suppose that's all.

1257
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:25,958
And that horrible Nellie
will be back tomorrow.

1258
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:30,432
We may never see each other again.
Ships that pass in the something or other.

1259
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:35,230
I like you. You're very sweet and patient.
I don't suppose I'm easy to get on with.

1260
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:38,233
Oh, but you are, madam.
It's been wonderful working with you.

1261
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,516
And I do love the theater so.

1262
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:43,558
I don't see why. It's an awful life, really.

1263
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:45,790
Here, darling.
A little something extra for you.

1264
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,234
I couldn't, madam. Honestly.

1265
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:51,234
Don't be an idiot. Put it in the bank
or go out and get drunk or something.

1266
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,231
- Thank you, madam.
- Can I give you a lift?

1267
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:56,949
- If you would drop me, I'd appreciate it.
- All right. Come along, then.

1268
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,717
- Good night.
- Good night.

1269
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:16,030
- Good night.
- Good night.

1270
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:22,594
- Could I talk to you in private?
- We can talk in the car. That's private.

1271
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:24,796
No, that won't do.
I've got to talk to you now.

1272
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:26,518
What's all this about?

1273
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:29,069
Let's go someplace
where nobody can hear us.

1274
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:30,798
Good night.

1275
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:36,150
- Have you gone mad or something?
- No, madam.

1276
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:39,392
I want to tell you about
the bloodstained doll.

1277
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:51,796
Well, what about that doll?

1278
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:55,438
Oh, I hate all this, madam.
I'm that nervous.

1279
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,239
I'm so afraid of doing the wrong thing.

1280
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,109
You see, I have a dress that belongs to
you with a big bloodstain down the front.

1281
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:04,430
By rights, I know I should
go to the police...

1282
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:07,034
...but, to tell you the truth,
madam, I'm afraid.

1283
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:10,112
My dad would murder me
if I got my name in the papers.

1284
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:13,317
<i>So, you see, I've come to you.</i>
<i>Maybe you could tell me what to do.</i>

1285
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:14,833
<i>How much do you want?</i>

1286
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,276
<i>Money never entered my head, madam.</i>
<i>I hope you won't think that of me.</i>

1287
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:23,275
<i>Only if the dress were clean like new, it</i>
<i>might be worth, say, 75 or 100 pounds.</i>

1288
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,277
I know nothing about
a bloodstained dress.

1289
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:29,000
This sounds to me remarkably
like blackmail.

1290
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:33,119
- I think I'd better call the police.
- Yes. Do call the police, Miss Inwood.

1291
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,037
We'll talk to them together.

1292
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,599
- You're not the maid.
- No, I'm not.

1293
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:44,035
Why have you been pretending
all this time?

1294
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,598
Shall we say we needed evidence?

1295
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:50,192
We? Are you from the police?

1296
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:53,108
<i>How was the bloodstain</i>
<i>smeared on the dress?</i>

1297
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:55,874
Who are you?

1298
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:59,396
Why were you frightened when Jonathan
said he hadn't destroyed the dress?

1299
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:03,473
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You do know!

1300
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:05,073
Yes.

1301
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:07,151
Some blood did splash on my dress.

1302
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:09,231
I was there when Jonathan
killed my husband.

1303
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:11,994
- That's not true.
- It is, but I had nothing to do with it.

1304
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:13,878
Jonathan wanted my name
kept out of it.

1305
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:15,519
He sent me back to his rooms.

1306
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:18,274
He stayed behind to make it look
like robbery.

1307
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:20,954
- Then he brought me a clean dress.
- You're lying.

1308
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:23,554
It's a sacred truth. I swear to you it is.

1309
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:24,994
<i>Listen, whoever you are...</i>

1310
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:27,674
<i>...I'll give you anything</i>
<i>if you keep me out of this.</i>

1311
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:30,713
<i>My jewelry is worth over 10,000 pounds.</i>
<i>You can have it all.</i>

1312
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:33,553
<i>And my furs or money.</i>
<i>How much do you want?</i>

1313
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,438
<i>I'll give you anything. Anything.</i>

1314
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:38,592
I'm going now to break it up.
Bring them in. I want them together.

1315
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:41,149
<i>You deliberately tried to pin</i>
<i>it all on Jonathan...</i>

1316
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:44,676
<i>...assisted by Mr. Freddie Williams.</i>
- <i>It's not true, I tell you. It's not!</i>

1317
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:47,752
<i>Well, you won't get away with it.</i>
<i>I warn you, that's all.</i>

1318
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:20,551
I've had a terrible scene
with a lunatic girl.

1319
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:24,349
First she pretended to be my dresser, then
a detective and tried to blackmail me.

1320
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:28,354
That's all right. You stay here.
I'll have a word with you in a minute.

1321
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,079
Oh, good. They got him.

1322
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:35,550
Jonathan, what have they done to you?

1323
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:38,075
Why are you arresting him?

1324
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:40,834
Mellish, stand by Miss Inwood there!

1325
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,792
Heavens, that must be Cooper.

1326
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:45,311
Where's Miss Inwood?

1327
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:48,588
Cover the alleyway in case he used
an emergency door.

1328
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:50,637
- Where do those stairs lead to?
- Dressing rooms.

1329
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,075
Eve! Eve, come back!

1330
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,559
Where's the nearest telephone?

1331
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:56,676
- Eve.
- He came through an emergency door.

1332
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:59,638
Hurry up downstairs. Go on, hurry!

1333
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:01,597
Get back into the theater.

1334
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,716
Have you been told
to keep an eye on me?

1335
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:06,269
In a manner of speaking, yes.

1336
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:11,069
- In that case, may I sit down?
- No harm in that.

1337
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,999
Get me a chair, then.

1338
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:15,230
Surely, ma'am. Surely.

1339
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:16,719
- <i>Done with the mike?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

1340
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:20,077
<i>Okay. I wonder if they caught...</i>

1341
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,311
What's the point of going up to the roof?

1342
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:31,711
He may have doubled back along
the alley and gone up the fire escape.

1343
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:34,958
- So they've heard everything I said?
- Yes.

1344
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:41,630
- And it's all in that book?
- All in there, in shorthand.

1345
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:43,711
How clever of you.

1346
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:47,470
Things look bad for me, don't they?

1347
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:51,869
I'm what you'd call an accessory...
I suppose.

1348
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:53,189
- George!
- Yes?

1349
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:56,318
Smith wants you down
at the stage doorkeeper's office.

1350
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,435
Thank you, darling.

1351
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:00,273
We'll need more men to cover
all the rooms in this place...

1352
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:03,151
It's not all in there.

1353
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,596
- What's your name?
- Mellish.

1354
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:12,112
- Do you like dogs, Mellish?
- Yes, ma'am, I do.

1355
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,595
But not all dogs.

1356
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:18,035
If they don't love you,
you don't love them.

1357
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:20,077
- That's right, isn't it?
- I suppose so.

1358
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:24,836
I had a dog once. He hated me.

1359
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,833
At last he bit me, and I had him shot.

1360
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:34,109
When I give all my love and get back
treachery and hatred, it's...

1361
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:38,872
It's as if my mother
had struck me in the face.

1362
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,192
Do you understand that, Mellish?

1363
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,476
I've heard it takes them
that way sometimes.

1364
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:50,797
Yes. It takes some of them that way.

1365
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:53,315
- Has Miss Inwood gone yet?
- No, she's in the theater.

1366
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:56,916
- Don't you think he's well away now?
- I'm sure I saw him run down the alley.

1367
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:58,514
This is Smith.

1368
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:01,433
We're covering the theater
from the roof to the storeroom.

1369
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,556
- Fine, sir.
- You heard what Miss Inwood said.

1370
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:05,597
You can't have anything
against Cooper now.

1371
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:09,070
Nothing, except murder. He killed
Charlotte's husband, all right.

1372
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:10,798
He's killed before.

1373
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:12,871
What? What do you mean?

1374
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:16,510
He got away with it last time with a plea
of self-defense. He won't this time.

1375
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:18,272
- But Eve.
- She's alone with him now.

1376
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:21,113
Can't you see, sir?
She's in very great danger.

1377
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,198
It all adds up to a confession,
except she said you killed him.

1378
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:43,033
Anyone in their right mind
could see she was telling a lie.

1379
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:46,112
But I don't understand why Smith
arrested you. What happened?

1380
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:48,714
Somebody phoned and said
the police were on their way.

1381
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:52,350
I made a bolt for it, and they
grabbed me at the street door.

1382
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:55,679
Funny, that.
Getting me out into the street.

1383
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:59,355
I suppose Smith didn't want me
to be caught in your house.

1384
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:01,835
That would have been awkward for you,
wouldn't it?

1385
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,150
I don't think they'll look
for us here for a bit.

1386
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:07,232
After a while, maybe we can make
a dash through an emergency exit.

1387
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:12,997
Eve. Eve. Eve, wherever you are,
come away from him.

1388
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:16,470
Come away from him.
He's dangerous. He's a killer.

1389
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:19,108
Eve? Eve?

1390
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:25,799
He's right, you know.
Charlotte was telling the truth.

1391
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:32,192
What she didn't tell you was that
she goaded me into doing it.

1392
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:34,749
She set me against him
in every way she could.

1393
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:37,992
She made me think she was crazy
about me, but she wasn't.

1394
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:42,790
I was to kill her husband to leave
the coast clear for that Freddie Williams.

1395
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:47,078
I know that now.
She knew the sort of man I was.

1396
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:50,437
She knows I can't control myself
if I get into a rage.

1397
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:53,319
Like a fool, I told her
about that girl I'd killed.

1398
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:56,552
Oh, Jonathan. Jonathan,
you don't know what you're saying.

1399
01:40:56,720 --> 01:41:01,191
I can't help it, Eve. I can't control
myself, even when I was a kid.

1400
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:06,032
I was lucky that last time. The little
fool threatened me with a gun.

1401
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:09,636
But you don't know what it's like to
have a thing like this hanging over you.

1402
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:16,116
Eve, I hated to tell you that
phony story in your car that time...

1403
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,430
...but there was no other way.

1404
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:23,428
Charlotte did go on to my flat
after I'd killed her husband.

1405
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:28,390
Her dress was stained a bit,
so I brought her a clean one.

1406
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:30,596
Then when she went to the theater...

1407
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:33,399
...I made a big stain on it
to make you believe me.

1408
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,673
I'm telling you the truth now.

1409
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:42,957
Jonathan...

1410
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:46,800
...I feel desperately sorry for you.

1411
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:48,871
Really, I do.

1412
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:54,074
No, you don't. You're not sorry at all.

1413
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:55,753
You don't care what happens to me.

1414
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:01,838
Jonathan...

1415
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:06,752
...you could give yourself up.
They'd take care of you.

1416
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:09,912
You couldn't do all these things
unless you...

1417
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:12,272
Unless...

1418
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:19,477
They can't do anything to a sick man,
and that's what you are. You must be.

1419
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:24,669
No. They're going to hang me. They'll
hang Charlotte, too, for planning it.

1420
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:28,995
They've never forgiven me for getting
away with it the first time.

1421
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:34,314
There's nothing wrong with my mind.
Nobody can prove that there is, unless...

1422
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:47,080
Unless I do it a third time...

1423
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:50,312
...with no reason whatever.

1424
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:54,555
That would be a clear case of insanity.

1425
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:56,679
Wouldn't it?

1426
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:01,679
Wouldn't it?

1427
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:17,793
Jonathan. Jonathan,
I don't hear a sound now.

1428
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:21,394
I think we can go now.

1429
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:25,394
We'll go out through the orchestra pit,
and then I'll take you to my father's boat.

1430
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,559
Come along.

1431
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,031
Here he is!

1432
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:03,234
Look! In the orchestra pit!

1433
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:09,756
Mathews, quick! Down in the orchestra!

1434
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:18,633
- They've got him!
- Where?

1435
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:20,632
- They found him.
- Where was he?

1436
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:23,234
- He was in the theater after all.
- Call Smith!

1437
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:26,870
- He was at the stage doorkeeper's office.
- Drop the iron curtain, cut him off!

1438
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:29,076
Get up! Move your head
out of the way!

1439
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:42,438
- Take the curtain up.
- Don't touch anything.

1440
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:45,398
Mellish, you'd better phone
up the photographer.

1441
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:49,792
Someone find out if Byard's here yet.
Tell him what's happened.

1442
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:23,311
