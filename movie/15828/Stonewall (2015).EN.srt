00:00:49,405 --> 00:00:52,275
Get back inside!

00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:33,408
Hey! Don't be scared.

5
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:36,680
Don't be scared. They ain't gonna bite you.

6
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,387
Come back, little lost sheep.

7
00:02:44,388 --> 00:02:46,456
I could be your shepherd.

Aw, poor little thing.

15
00:03:18,455 --> 00:03:21,090
Long way from home.

16
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:24,426
Starving and dragging a suitcase

17
00:03:24,427 --> 00:03:27,162
like a little baby chicken.

18
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:29,598
I'm not starving, sir.
I just had two hot dogs.

19
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,471
Oh, you want a third? Hmm?

20
00:03:35,938 --> 00:03:39,575
I'm kidding.

21
00:03:41,544 --> 00:03:43,446
You need somewhere to rest
your pretty little head

22
00:03:43,447 --> 00:03:45,114
and collect yourself?

23
00:03:45,115 --> 00:03:46,816
I happen to have a comfy little place

24
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:49,086
right around the corner.

25
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,121
No, I can wait. Thank you, sir.

26
00:03:53,122 --> 00:03:57,894
Whoa, but I'm sure
they're worried to death.

27
00:03:57,895 --> 00:04:02,565
I bet they're by the telephone
right this second saying...

28
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:05,567
"When will he call?"

29
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:07,103

Queen Tooey, leave him alone! Jesus!

34
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,588
You never stop, and you sound terrible.

35
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:28,857
Ray, darling, I sound just fine

36
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:30,559
for somebody who's had a
dick in his mouth all night.

37
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,227
Oops!

38
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:33,696
Girl, from the looks of you,

39
00:04:33,697 --> 00:04:35,530
that's the least of your worries.

40
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:37,165
Listen up, kid.

41
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,868
Don't follow this one
unless you want to end up

42
00:04:38,869 --> 00:04:41,070
tied to a chair and
smothered in pancake batter

43
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:42,237
or whatever that shit is.

44
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,876
- Coca-Cola, please.
- Yes, sir.

45
00:04:48,612 --> 00:04:50,679
Have a nice day, boys,

46
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,883
and remember, don't talk to strangers.

47
00:04:56,887 --> 00:04:58,688
Do you know him?

48
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:01,224
Her? Yeah, I know her.

49
00:05:01,225 --> 00:05:03,092
Why did you call him Queen Tooey?

50
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:05,727
Because she goes into people's cabinets

51
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:07,830
and steals their Tuninal.

52
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:12,234
Beans? Jeebs? Downers?

53
00:05:12,235 --> 00:05:13,736
Right.

54
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:17,540
Oh, baby, you don't know nothing, do you?

55
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,744
I know I don't want to be tied to a chair

56
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:24,080
and covered in pancake batter.

57
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:27,282
I don't know.

58
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:32,787
It could be fun. Sticky but fun.

59
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,225
I already got you all figured out, okay?

60
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:39,160
- Yeah? How's that?
- Hey, mama.

61
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:42,265
Let's see. Grew up in Kansas, right?

62
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:43,732
On like a pea farm or whatever.

63
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:47,169
Kissing goats and your
daddy was the preacher,

64
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,004
but secretly a little whoopsie, right,

65
00:05:49,005 --> 00:05:51,306
and Mama probably baked apple pies

66
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:53,643
and, uh, wrote your name in your underwear

67
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,677
with tiny thread.

68
00:05:55,678 --> 00:05:58,547
Okay, well, A, I'm from Brooktown, Indiana,

69
00:05:58,548 --> 00:06:01,316
and B, I did not grow
up making out with goats,

70
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:03,085
and C, I'm here because I'm actually going

71
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:04,986
- to Columbia in the fall.
- Oh, Columbia.

72
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:07,924
That's right, and hang on,
what the hell is a pea farm?

73
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:09,958
Look, small details, baby.

74
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:12,128
Once you realized what you really were,

75
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:15,131
you had to run away from home
to find your ass and quick.

76
00:06:19,002 --> 00:06:21,003
And what am I?

77
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:22,104
Well, you certainly didn't
come to Christopher Street

78
00:06:22,105 --> 00:06:23,974
for the pizza.

79
00:06:28,045 --> 00:06:32,314
I didn't run away from home. Kicked out.

80
00:06:32,315 --> 00:06:35,116
Hey, look, run away, kicked out.

81
00:06:35,117 --> 00:06:38,621
All that really matters
is now you're here, right?

82
00:06:38,622 --> 00:06:42,258
And you don't know what is what.

83
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:45,828
Welcome to New York and keep up.

84
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:51,900
Yo, everybody. This here's Danny.

85
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:54,203
He's on his way to Columbia in the fall.

86
00:06:54,204 --> 00:06:57,006
Danny, meet my little ladies of the night.

87
00:06:57,007 --> 00:06:58,808
Queen Conga, straight off the boat

88
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:01,744
from some godforsaken island.

89
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:04,679
And this Beatle groupie
over here, that's Quiet Paul.

90
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,114
And the chicken bone is Little Lee.

91
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:07,683
What's up, man?

92
00:07:07,684 --> 00:07:08,850
Hey.

93
00:07:08,851 --> 00:07:11,620
Nobody gonna introduce me?

94
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:18,027
And this pathetic creature is Orphan Annie.

95
00:07:18,028 --> 00:07:19,128
How long you been working the streets?

96
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:21,664
Annie, the boy just got
here. I mean, look at him.

97
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:24,167
Gee, he looks a lot like Justin.

98
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:27,869
I sure hope you don't end up like him.

99
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,171
What did you just say?

100
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:30,405
I didn't say nothing. I was just saying,

101
00:07:30,406 --> 00:07:31,573
hope you don't end up like him.

102
00:07:31,574 --> 00:07:33,975
Don't you fuckin' talk about
Justin, you little bitch!

103
00:07:33,976 --> 00:07:35,645
Girls!

104
00:07:35,646 --> 00:07:36,645
I'm the bitch? You're the bitch,

105
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:39,314
picking up a know-nothing,
white trash twink.

106
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,020
Just don't be talking about Justin, okay?

107
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:46,422
You gonna use it or not?

108
00:07:46,423 --> 00:07:49,224
It's just too nice a day

109
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:51,260
to cut each other up, isn't it?

110
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:55,131
Blood, mess, tragically ruined outfits.

111
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:59,669
You fuckin' lucky bitch!

112
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,438
Yo, I'm starving. Is anybody else hungry?

113
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,239
- <i>Moi!</i>
- You wanna come?

114
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,409
Uh, no. I gotta, you
know, I got all this stuff.

115
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,309
Oh, Bob, will you take
his suitcase, please?

116
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,511
Yeah, of course.

117
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:13,215
It's cool. We take care of
his dog, he takes care of us.

118
00:08:13,216 --> 00:08:15,150
Sure?

119
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:16,785
I'm upstairs. Just bring it
up to the top of the steps.

120
00:08:16,786 --> 00:08:18,953
Okay.

121
00:08:18,954 --> 00:08:22,825
Oh, now that's gorgeous!

122
00:08:22,826 --> 00:08:26,261
What? That straw thing with the flowers?

123
00:08:26,262 --> 00:08:29,297
Oh, I think it'll look nice on you, Annie.

124
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:31,367
Whoa!

125
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:45,114
Hey, what'd you do?

126
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,321
<i>♪ We are the baddest girls</i>

127

<i>♪ We wear no underwear</i>

129

<i>♪ We show our pubic hair ♪</i>

130
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:04,768
Oh, shit! The law! The law!

131
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,206
Oh, I don't like that
coffee. I like Cavalier.

132
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:13,843
What's wrong? No, no, no.

133
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,510
Cavalier tastes like cat piss.

134
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:16,845
Chock Full o' Nuts?

135
00:09:16,846 --> 00:09:17,912
Why can't we get both?

136
00:09:17,913 --> 00:09:18,947
We can't afford both.

137
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:20,148
Why not?

138
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:23,051
Because Mama's in the hospital.

139
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:24,519
- My mom's in the hospital.
- Yes, she is.

140
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,888
And she's dying...

141
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,322
...of cancer.

142
00:09:27,323 --> 00:09:28,324
Hey, I'm really sorry that your ma's sick,

143
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:29,325
but keep it down.

144
00:09:29,326 --> 00:09:30,893
I got other customers.
Show a little respect.

145
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:32,228
Stop that!

146
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:34,363
You know what? From now on, you get...

147
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:39,067
Yes, you are. You get your
hot beverages on your own.

148
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:41,771
Anything else?

149
00:09:41,772 --> 00:09:44,038
Barbra is a much bigger star.

150
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:46,008
Than Judy?

151
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:47,777
There's something so
broken about that junkie.

152
00:09:47,778 --> 00:09:49,411
I like someone who ain't
gonna collapse any minute.

153
00:09:49,412 --> 00:09:51,279
And that's Barbra.

154
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,016
Will someone please tell
this sticky, sugar-faced fool

155
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:55,950
that Judy's supposed to be tragic.

156
00:09:55,951 --> 00:09:57,552
It's a part of her beauty.

157
00:09:57,553 --> 00:09:59,888
In the <i>Wizard of Oz,</i>
man, she's just like us.

158
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:02,925
A girl just lost in a world
that don't understand her.

159
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:04,325
Midgets!

160
00:10:04,326 --> 00:10:07,196
That is so true, my
little wretched darling.

161
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:11,066
I have so missed you!

162
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:13,802
Oh, she's back, the
Queen of Queens herself.

163
00:10:13,803 --> 00:10:15,436
Danny, meet Marsha Johnson.

164
00:10:15,437 --> 00:10:18,907
Marsha P. Johnson, if you please, darling.

165
00:10:18,908 --> 00:10:20,109
What's the "P" stand for?

166
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,311
Pay no mind.

167
00:10:23,312 --> 00:10:25,580
Marsha is the only drag
queen that's nice to us.

168
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:28,484
Those other nasty
bitches don't know one day

169
00:10:28,485 --> 00:10:30,920
Jesus is gonna punish them for their sins

170
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,221
and fuck them up good!

171
00:10:33,222 --> 00:10:37,859
Okay? Oh, shit! My
first appointment awaits.

172
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,228
It's a certain fat priest
who has to pray to Mary

173
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:40,396
as he comes.

174
00:10:40,397 --> 00:10:42,898
Wait, wait, wait... Is he really fat?

175
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:45,567
Shit, I know him. Everybody knows him!

176
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:49,470
Now, Lee, you stay away from my regulars.

177
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,605
You don't want me to have to spank you.

178
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:52,441
Maybe I do.

179
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:53,542
Bye, girls.

180
00:10:53,543 --> 00:10:54,877
Bye, lover.

181
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:58,547
Hmm.

182
00:10:58,548 --> 00:11:01,050
Always on time.

183
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:05,186
By the way, Judy is not
that good of an actress.

184
00:11:05,187 --> 00:11:08,157
All right, Danny Boy, I'm
gonna see you later, okay?

185
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:10,960
Mama's got to work. Bye, girls.

186
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,460
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

187
00:11:12,461 --> 00:11:14,563
Which is nothing, girl.

188
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:18,367
Bitch has got to book. You coming?

189
00:11:18,368 --> 00:11:22,370
Mmm-hmm. No rest for the weary.

190
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:26,208
See ya later, Columbia.

191
00:11:41,924 --> 00:11:44,960
<i>But all homosexuals are not passive.</i>

192
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:48,630
<i>Public restrooms can often be
a hangout for the homosexuals.</i>

193
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:51,099
<i>Bobby and his friends
hadn't noticed the man</i>

194
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,369
<i>who had been in the
restroom when they changed,</i>

195
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,470
<i>and as it was late, he suggested</i>

196
00:11:54,471 --> 00:11:57,071
<i>they take the shortcut
under the pier,</i>

197
00:11:57,072 --> 00:11:58,440
<i>but the others preferred to take</i>

198
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:00,475
<i>the more traveled way home.</i>

199
00:12:00,476 --> 00:12:02,444
Bobby, run away from the
faggot behind you, Bobby.

200
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:06,581
<i>Bobby had made a wise decision.</i>

201
00:12:06,582 --> 00:12:09,318
<i>It may have saved his life.</i>

202
00:12:12,322 --> 00:12:13,955
Okay, kids.

203
00:12:13,956 --> 00:12:16,624
These are the things
we have to be aware of.

204
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,661
You know there are sick people out there,

205
00:12:18,662 --> 00:12:20,696
and they are waiting.

206
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:22,564
What is it that they do exactly?

207
00:12:22,565 --> 00:12:24,633
Well, they're kind of like Count Dracula,

208
00:12:24,634 --> 00:12:26,534
but instead of sucking your blood,

209
00:12:26,535 --> 00:12:29,003
eh, they're sucking something else.

210
00:12:29,004 --> 00:12:30,306
Nah, Trev, you got it all wrong.

211
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:32,007
A guy wears a dress,

212
00:12:32,008 --> 00:12:33,341
the other guy takes that dress off,

213
00:12:33,342 --> 00:12:35,176
and then they do it up the butt.

214
00:12:35,177 --> 00:12:37,012
How do you know so much about it, Mattie?

215
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:39,380
Oh, Joe.

216
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:42,051
I still don't get it. Joe!

217
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:49,524
- Let's go!
- Sixty-eight!

218
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:51,527
Why you babies stopping back there?

219
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:54,062
Let's add 20 pushups.

220
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:56,065
On my whistle, Joe's gonna count 'em out.

221
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,969
One, two, three...

222
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,537
That's right, Joe. You set the pace here.

223
00:13:01,538 --> 00:13:04,706
Keep going. Attaboy, Joe.

224
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:06,341
Come on, Danny. You gonna join us sometime

225
00:13:06,342 --> 00:13:08,076
before 1970 rolls around?

226
00:13:08,077 --> 00:13:09,378
Let's go.

227
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:12,748
Three, two. Come on, Danny, get up!

228
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:17,753
You never shower.

229
00:13:17,754 --> 00:13:19,421
I never sweat. Some people don't sweat.

230
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:21,490
I'm one of 'em.

231
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:28,031
You around this weekend?

232
00:13:45,081 --> 00:13:48,683
I can't be any easier on
you, Danny. I just can't.

233
00:13:50,253 --> 00:13:53,022
You understand that, right?

234
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,358
Yes, Dad.

235
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,169
Hey, hey, hey!

236
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:49,344
<i>For only 100 bucks?</i>

237
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:50,579
<i>Talk about taking advantage
of a little kid...</i>

238
00:14:52,081 --> 00:14:53,681
<i>...who's a member
of a minority group.</i>

239
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:58,119
I got it.

240
00:14:59,755 --> 00:15:01,624
Coach Winters.

241
00:15:04,094 --> 00:15:06,628
Who is this?

242
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:09,599
Dad, it's me. Can we talk, please?

243
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,835
I'm just calling 'cause I...
I hope you're still gonna

244
00:15:13,836 --> 00:15:16,205
send in the papers for
my scholarship, all right?

245
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,538
<i>You know that...</i>

246
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:23,446
Dad?

247
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:32,054
Was that Danny?

248
00:15:33,722 --> 00:15:36,058
Dad?

249
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,705
I'm sorry, sir, but we're closed.

250
00:15:50,706 --> 00:15:53,175
Can I just get a cup of coffee, please?

251
00:15:53,176 --> 00:15:55,211
Sure.

252
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:01,650
Thanks.

253
00:16:04,287 --> 00:16:06,187
Um, I don't suppose you're
hiring at the moment,

254
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:07,689
are you, sir?

255
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,892
Got any experience as a short order cook?

256
00:16:09,893 --> 00:16:12,226
- No.
- Hi, everybody.

257
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,663
They all queers now.

258
00:16:15,664 --> 00:16:16,931
It used to be poets and mobsters.

259
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:19,567
Now they just fags.

260
00:16:19,568 --> 00:16:21,536
I'm real sorry, sir. Thank you.

261
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,716
Yeah, I'm actually late,
so I'm gonna head out now.

262
00:16:35,717 --> 00:16:37,719
Good to see you.

263
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,656
- Be careful!
- As always!

264
00:16:42,825 --> 00:16:45,426
Why, hello again, Mr. Danny.

265
00:16:45,427 --> 00:16:47,763
Out for a stroll, are we?

266
00:16:47,764 --> 00:16:49,931
No, no, I'm looking for Ray.

267
00:16:49,932 --> 00:16:52,600
The new boys hang out a little further...

268
00:16:52,601 --> 00:16:54,235
Yeah, how are you?

269
00:16:54,236 --> 00:16:56,738
Hey, what's up? Yo, how you doing?

270
00:17:10,385 --> 00:17:13,388
Hey, Ray? Ray!

271
00:17:28,471 --> 00:17:30,439
Oh, shit.

272
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:38,614
Get out of my way!

273
00:17:38,615 --> 00:17:41,383
Get out of here, God damn it!

274
00:17:41,384 --> 00:17:43,285
You fuckin' faggots, move your ass.

275
00:17:43,286 --> 00:17:44,853
Get out of here.

276
00:17:44,854 --> 00:17:46,721
Get the fuck out of here!

277
00:17:46,722 --> 00:17:48,457
You're disturbing my friends!

278
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,491
Get the fuck away from here.

279
00:17:50,492 --> 00:17:53,195
You fucking cocksuckers!

280
00:17:55,597 --> 00:17:57,798
What are you looking at, faggot?

281
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,468
Nothing.

282
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,545
Hey, where you going, cum stain?

283
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:17,719
He's pretty, yeah.

284
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,355
Oh, you're a pretty one, huh?

285
00:18:21,356 --> 00:18:23,057
You wanna suck my dick?

286
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:24,759
I think he wants to suck your dick.

287
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,893
You wanna suck my dick?

288
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:27,328
No.

289
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:28,896
- Come on.
- Suck his dick!

290
00:18:28,897 --> 00:18:31,666
Suck his fuckin' dick!
Get in there right now.

291
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:33,434
Hey, hey!

292
00:18:33,435 --> 00:18:34,635
Oh, shit! No! No!

293
00:18:34,636 --> 00:18:36,371
She's got a temper, huh?

294
00:18:36,372 --> 00:18:37,873
No!

295
00:18:37,874 --> 00:18:40,041
Still got a temper, faggot? Huh?

296
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:47,717
No, no!

297
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:51,585
Stop. Stop!

298
00:18:58,694 --> 00:18:59,661
You know what, I don't even want him

299
00:18:59,662 --> 00:19:01,863
to suck my dick no more!

300
00:19:01,864 --> 00:19:03,464
Look at his mouth. It's
all full of blood and shit.

301
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:05,933
That's disgusting.

302
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:17,578
Heavenly Father, we
thank you for this food.

303
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:18,880
For these and all your blessings,

304
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:20,082
God's holy name be blessed and praised

305
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,950
through Jesus Christ, our Lord, amen.

306
00:19:21,951 --> 00:19:23,818
Amen.

307
00:19:26,722 --> 00:19:29,457
They showed a film in school today.

308
00:19:30,492 --> 00:19:34,462
We younger kids were not allowed to see it.

309
00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:37,532
I wonder why.

310
00:19:39,602 --> 00:19:41,502
Mr. Truman Capote,

311
00:19:41,503 --> 00:19:44,873
who wrote <i>In Cold
Blood,</i> is also a homosexual.

312
00:19:44,874 --> 00:19:46,842
Maybe that's why

313
00:19:46,843 --> 00:19:48,410
I wasn't allowed to see that movie either.

314
00:19:48,411 --> 00:19:51,614
Phoebe, we're having dinner, thank you.

315
00:19:54,384 --> 00:19:56,050
Well, I also really want
to see <i>Dr. Doolittle.</i>

316
00:19:56,051 --> 00:19:59,086
- He talks to animals.
- Hmm.

317
00:19:59,087 --> 00:20:02,022
Maybe you should see that movie, Dad.

318
00:20:02,023 --> 00:20:03,958
Maybe he could get you to talk.

319
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:08,864
You finding this amusing, Danny?

320
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:13,602
No, sir.

321
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:15,638
"No, sir."

322
00:20:19,442 --> 00:20:21,810
Can I borrow your car tonight, Mom?

323
00:20:25,882 --> 00:20:27,983
Joe wants me to hang out with him.

324
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:33,154
Don't be home too late.

325
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:35,423
I won't.

326
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:40,929
Brent, do you really think
it was such a good idea?

327
00:20:42,698 --> 00:20:43,798
Sheriff Goodwin was great, honey.

328
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,200
He laid it all out.

329
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:47,035
I don't even think it's true,

330
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:49,570
and I don't know why you do.

331
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:50,704
There are signs,

332
00:20:50,705 --> 00:20:51,706
and if you don't wanna see them,

333
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:53,776
that's fine, but I do.

334
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:08,856
<i>This is WTTV FM,</i>

335
00:21:08,857 --> 00:21:11,125
<i>rocking Brooktown all night long.</i>

336
00:21:15,163 --> 00:21:18,000
They're not gonna go, Joe,
I'm telling you right now.

337
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:20,902
Hey, Danny.

338
00:21:20,903 --> 00:21:23,204
We're taking bets on who's
goin' to the World Series.

339
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:25,739
Joe picks the Mets.

340
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,941
Yeah, I guess.

341
00:21:26,942 --> 00:21:29,009
See? He knows.

342
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,179
- Danny knows.
- Hi, Danny.

343
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,547
- Hey.
- Sarah got into Syracuse.

344
00:21:33,548 --> 00:21:35,150
- Oh, yeah?
- Did you hear from Columbia?

345
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:37,019
Yeah.

346
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:41,990
Hey, about time you showed up.

347
00:21:43,692 --> 00:21:45,927
Bye, guys.

348
00:21:47,163 --> 00:21:49,163
I don't know. Danny's just weird.

349
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:54,001
He never wants to stick around.

350
00:21:54,002 --> 00:21:55,103
Come on, babe. Let's go, too.

351
00:21:55,104 --> 00:21:56,837
I gotta get the car back.

352
00:21:56,838 --> 00:21:59,741
Okay. Bye, guys.

353
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:26,067
Hey.

354
00:22:32,842 --> 00:22:35,076
God, that fuckin' film!

355
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,815
Yep. They were creepy-looking men.

356
00:22:40,816 --> 00:22:42,851
Half the fuckin' faculty
look like those guys.

357
00:22:42,852 --> 00:22:46,153
Joe, don't be stupid. He meant it for us...

358
00:22:46,154 --> 00:22:48,856
At least he meant it for me.

359
00:22:48,857 --> 00:22:51,759
He even dragged poor Sheriff Goodwin along,

360
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,962
telling me he was on to us.

361
00:22:55,131 --> 00:22:57,766
Hey.

362
00:23:01,871 --> 00:23:04,172
I can't wait to get out of this place.

363
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:06,807
Joe, wait. Wait, wait! Wait, wait!

364
00:23:06,808 --> 00:23:09,243
What?

365
00:23:09,244 --> 00:23:11,145
Do you think we're sick?

366
00:23:11,146 --> 00:23:13,647
It's just nothing. It's not anything.

367
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:15,850
Cool it!

368
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:19,120
We're just fooling around.
Sarah won't do anything.

369
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:21,288
You don't even have a girlfriend.

370
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:23,290
It's more than that. I just...

371
00:23:25,294 --> 00:23:27,630
I really like you, Joe.

372
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:34,102
Don't fucking say that.
This is just for now.

373
00:23:34,103 --> 00:23:36,971
We're not faggots.

374
00:23:36,972 --> 00:23:40,108
Just relax, Danny. Relax.

375
00:24:07,836 --> 00:24:09,170
Looks like our Johnny Boy

376
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:11,006
didn't take his girl right home, huh?

377
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:14,041
A little stopover first.

378
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:16,578
A little bit of hanky-panky, man.

379
00:24:19,714 --> 00:24:22,350
Excuse me.

380
00:24:22,351 --> 00:24:23,718
Matt, where you going?

381
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:24,919
Shh!

382
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,055
Where are you going?

383
00:24:27,056 --> 00:24:30,092
Going to surprise them.

384
00:24:45,207 --> 00:24:47,241
Oh, no!

385
00:25:02,424 --> 00:25:04,726
What was that?

386
00:25:07,962 --> 00:25:10,065
What was that?

387
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:31,653
Don't be a stranger!

388
00:25:38,794 --> 00:25:41,328
Ray? Ray!

389
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:42,797
Hey, Columbia.

390
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:43,897
Wait!

391
00:25:43,898 --> 00:25:46,300
Wow, nice digs.

392
00:25:46,301 --> 00:25:48,470
Where you been?

393
00:25:48,471 --> 00:25:50,004
I was away for a while.

394
00:25:50,005 --> 00:25:51,405
Yeah?

395
00:25:51,406 --> 00:25:53,374
The fuck happen to you?

396
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:57,345
Nothing. I've been lookin' for you.

397
00:25:57,346 --> 00:25:58,846
Nothing?

398
00:25:58,847 --> 00:26:00,515
Nothing will do that, all right.

399
00:26:00,516 --> 00:26:02,816
Come on.

400
00:26:02,817 --> 00:26:04,052
Where we going?

401
00:26:04,053 --> 00:26:06,121
What, you got a better option?

402
00:26:06,122 --> 00:26:08,123
No.

403
00:26:25,473 --> 00:26:27,710
Hurry up!

404
00:26:30,445 --> 00:26:33,182
What took you so long?

405
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:54,836
What are you waiting for?

406
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,179
You're handsome!

407
00:27:50,226 --> 00:27:53,260
It's okay.

408
00:27:53,261 --> 00:27:55,963
Listen, this is only temporary

409
00:27:55,964 --> 00:27:59,601
because we could find a real place

410
00:27:59,602 --> 00:28:02,271
'cause I just made some real money.

411
00:28:03,972 --> 00:28:06,473
I got a cousin.

412
00:28:06,474 --> 00:28:09,943
He went to pharmacy school in California.

413
00:28:09,944 --> 00:28:16,049
You know, where Judy and Liza and Lorna,

414
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,953
they live there with a lot of palm trees.

415
00:28:19,954 --> 00:28:22,323
You could go to pharmacy school, too.

416
00:28:22,324 --> 00:28:25,226
I can't go because I'm not smart like that,

417
00:28:25,227 --> 00:28:28,528
but I can make a nice home.

418
00:28:28,529 --> 00:28:33,166
I could clean. I could
cook <i>arroz con pollo.</i>

419
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:37,005
I could drive to the
supermarket in our Chevrolet,

420
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:40,475
and I could buy groceries.

421
00:28:40,476 --> 00:28:43,944
It'll be so nice.

422
00:28:43,945 --> 00:28:47,114
Would you like that?

423
00:28:47,115 --> 00:28:49,283
Danny?

424
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,596
Good night.

425
00:29:56,117 --> 00:30:01,923
Daniel, the Coach wants
to see you right away.

426
00:30:26,615 --> 00:30:28,683
Joe...

427
00:31:02,417 --> 00:31:04,986
I know everything.

428
00:31:06,587 --> 00:31:09,624
Don't bother denying it. Joe told me,

429
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:12,059
and I'd seen it coming, too.

430
00:31:13,461 --> 00:31:15,596
The sickness...

431
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:21,068
You, seducing him,

432
00:31:22,104 --> 00:31:24,306
taking the lead.

433
00:31:25,507 --> 00:31:27,575
Oh, it's such a great way to attack me

434
00:31:27,576 --> 00:31:29,810
and ruin my quarterback.

435
00:31:29,811 --> 00:31:31,746
You got him drunk so
he wouldn't even realize

436
00:31:31,747 --> 00:31:34,349
what was going on.

437
00:31:35,817 --> 00:31:39,152
I wanna do the right thing, Danny.

438
00:31:39,153 --> 00:31:41,622
You need help, son,

439
00:31:41,623 --> 00:31:44,825
and we're gonna get you that help.

440
00:31:44,826 --> 00:31:48,329
I need you to look me in the eye, Danny,

441
00:31:49,498 --> 00:31:51,665
and tell me you need help.

442
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:54,602
This is a one-time thing, Danny.

443
00:31:57,772 --> 00:31:59,807
Look at me.

444
00:32:05,114 --> 00:32:08,216
Say it!

445
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:11,719
This is a one-time thing, Danny. Say it!

446
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,322
Say it!

447
00:33:15,517 --> 00:33:17,853
Your father called.

448
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:53,386
Please don't go, Danny!

449
00:33:53,387 --> 00:33:55,823
Hey, hey, hey!

450
00:33:55,824 --> 00:33:59,626
Please don't leave, Danny, please. Please.

451
00:33:59,627 --> 00:34:02,662
Phoebe, look, I have
to, all right? I have to.

452
00:34:02,663 --> 00:34:04,498
They said all these mean things at school.

453
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:06,499
I just had to get out of there.

454
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,002
I know, I know. You're
smarter than them, right?

455
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:10,038
They're gonna keep saying those things,

456
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:11,805
but you're not going to
believe them, are you?

457
00:34:11,806 --> 00:34:13,874
No.

458
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:15,308
Look, I'm going to write you, okay?

459
00:34:15,309 --> 00:34:16,977
I'm going to write you every single day.

460
00:34:16,978 --> 00:34:18,379
I promise you, every single day.

461
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:24,919
Where do you want to go?

462
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,520
I'm going to go to New York maybe.

463
00:34:26,521 --> 00:34:31,259
I'll come with you. I...
I can come with you. Please.

464
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,993
Oh, Phebes, you know you can't.

465
00:34:32,994 --> 00:34:35,863
Cricket, you know you can't.

466
00:34:35,864 --> 00:34:37,031
Come on.

467
00:35:04,992 --> 00:35:06,860
Joe.

468
00:35:08,396 --> 00:35:10,363
What do you want?

469
00:35:10,364 --> 00:35:14,001
Joe, it's me.

470
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,573
Why did you lie about us?

471
00:35:20,574 --> 00:35:23,410
You should go, Danny.

472
00:35:24,746 --> 00:35:27,249
Please, just go!

473
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:47,736
Joe, who was that?

474
00:36:05,353 --> 00:36:07,955
Asshole, we're trying
to get our beauty sleep.

475
00:36:07,956 --> 00:36:10,357
Open up!

476
00:36:10,358 --> 00:36:14,295
Someone answer the goddamn
fuckin' door, please!

477
00:36:15,496 --> 00:36:16,596
Look, mister, you're
going to have to give us

478
00:36:16,597 --> 00:36:17,997
a few more hours.

479
00:36:17,998 --> 00:36:19,933
We're working girls in here, you know that.

480
00:36:19,934 --> 00:36:22,002
No. You gotta get out.
I know what's going on.

481
00:36:22,003 --> 00:36:23,571
There's at least a dozen
of you guys in there.

482
00:36:23,572 --> 00:36:25,105
Oh, come on, mister.

483
00:36:25,106 --> 00:36:27,908
We're gonna be really nice
to you, aren't we, girls?

484
00:36:27,909 --> 00:36:29,509
I could be nice, but I don't want to.

485
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,111
We'll pay for tomorrow.

486
00:36:31,112 --> 00:36:32,613
If you guys are not out
of here in half an hour,

487
00:36:32,614 --> 00:36:34,916
I'll call the police.

488
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,651
You heard the bitch.

489
00:36:37,652 --> 00:36:41,955
Fuck! It's a brand new
day, bitches. Wake up.

490
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,918
Mmm. Mmm.

491
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,020
What?

492
00:37:14,021 --> 00:37:15,689
No, nothing.

493
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:19,526
Oh? College boy has a problem?

494
00:37:19,527 --> 00:37:21,995
This weekend, I'll go
dancing at the Stonewall,

495
00:37:21,996 --> 00:37:24,198
and I wanna look just
right when I'm dancing.

496
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,665
You look right now, mama.

497
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:26,767
I want to shine, bitches.

498
00:37:28,036 --> 00:37:29,870
- You're shining, mama.
- Mmm.

499
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:32,773
So you just take whatever you want?

500
00:37:33,842 --> 00:37:38,979
Yeah. That's right, farm boy.

501
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:44,484
I take whatever I want
and can 'cause if I didn't,

502
00:37:44,485 --> 00:37:48,555
I'd have nothing at all.

503
00:37:48,556 --> 00:37:49,823
That might be a lesson you wanna learn

504
00:37:49,824 --> 00:37:51,960
before you go to college, okay?

505
00:37:53,027 --> 00:37:56,596
'Cause the truth is,
you ain't going nowhere

506
00:37:56,597 --> 00:37:59,567
other than the street,
just like the rest of us.

507
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,701
Everyone in this room thinks

508
00:38:01,702 --> 00:38:05,038
they're on their way to somewhere better,

509
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:07,174
but I have not seen one dream come true

510
00:38:07,175 --> 00:38:10,710
on Christopher Street, baby.

511
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:13,414
Not one.

512
00:38:14,615 --> 00:38:18,919
And my dream has always been
to have this shade of red,

513
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,221
and bitches, I got it.

514
00:38:43,244 --> 00:38:46,080
Nah. Look, there's nothing we can do.

515
00:38:46,081 --> 00:38:48,281
We don't have the documents
from your folks, Mr. Winters.

516
00:38:48,282 --> 00:38:50,651
But I'm still admitted, right? So...

517
00:38:50,652 --> 00:38:53,220
Yeah, I can hold your place
until June, July maybe,

518
00:38:53,221 --> 00:38:54,288
but after that...

519
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:57,625
I mean, there's kids on
the waiting list, right?

520
00:38:59,661 --> 00:39:03,531
May I ask why you're incomplete?

521
00:39:03,532 --> 00:39:06,634
I had to leave early for personal reasons.

522
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:11,272
Look, when a kid comes into
my office in this situation,

523
00:39:11,273 --> 00:39:14,607
I say, do everything you can to graduate.

524
00:39:14,608 --> 00:39:16,810
The City of New York
will let you do it here

525
00:39:16,811 --> 00:39:19,078
at night for free, right
here at the college.

526
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:20,647
Night school.

527
00:39:20,648 --> 00:39:22,816
And then you can come here in the fall,

528
00:39:22,817 --> 00:39:26,887
scholarship intact and
even have somewhere to live.

529
00:39:27,956 --> 00:39:30,024
- Frankie!
- Look.

530
00:39:30,025 --> 00:39:31,125
I can't have you and half a dozen of

531
00:39:31,126 --> 00:39:32,093
underage hustlers here.

532
00:39:32,094 --> 00:39:34,328
Half a dozen? That seems
like the least amount

533
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:37,196
of hustlers you need, Frankie, baby.

534
00:39:37,197 --> 00:39:38,832
Now I know some of your clientele

535
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:40,634
might come in for your
watered-down drinks,

536
00:39:40,635 --> 00:39:44,939
but the only cock and tail
they stay for, honey, is ours.

537
00:39:48,275 --> 00:39:51,611
Tata!

538
00:39:52,981 --> 00:39:55,281
Ladies and gentlemen,

539
00:39:55,282 --> 00:39:59,118
please address me as Queen Conga.

540
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,223
Do you like it?

541
00:40:04,224 --> 00:40:06,794
Oh, yeah. No, it's beautiful,

542
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:10,029
except I think I've seen that
fabric before, Queen Conga...

543
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,832
- Oh, really? Mmm.
- ...but where? Mmm?

544
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:16,837
Oh, country mouse is learning
how to talk like a city girl.

545
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:19,272
- Sure is.
- Ah!

546
00:40:19,273 --> 00:40:23,042
It's impolite to keep Her Majesty waiting.

547
00:40:23,043 --> 00:40:26,047
Come on, Frankie, be a dear.

548
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:29,649
Ooh!

549
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:31,785
Follow me, boys!

550
00:40:31,786 --> 00:40:34,721
What you waiting for? It's fun.

551
00:40:34,722 --> 00:40:38,759
Hello, darling. Two tickets, please.

552
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,095
Look, you gotta sign in.
Don't use your real name.

553
00:40:41,096 --> 00:40:42,962
This shithole is run by the mob.

554
00:40:42,963 --> 00:40:44,999
They don't got a liquor license.

555
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,667
What do you mean, this
place is run by the mob?

556
00:40:46,668 --> 00:40:48,201
Oh, listen, bitch. Don't
you know that selling alcohol

557
00:40:48,202 --> 00:40:50,870
to us sexual deviants is illegal?

558
00:40:50,871 --> 00:40:53,841
That's why these greasy
fucktards and bastards

559
00:40:53,842 --> 00:40:57,011
own almost all the gay
bars in the Village. Mmm.

560
00:40:57,012 --> 00:40:59,812
Nobody likes us, baby.
Plus, they got the drugs,

561
00:40:59,813 --> 00:41:01,214
the pills and the booze.

562
00:41:01,215 --> 00:41:02,716
Smart, smart businessmen.

563
00:41:02,717 --> 00:41:03,984
Yeah, very smart, indeed.

564
00:41:03,985 --> 00:41:05,285
I don't wanna know how
much y'all spend a week

565
00:41:05,286 --> 00:41:07,788
paying off the cops, too.

566
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:10,189
Thanks, Frankie.

567
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,292
<i>Voila!</i>

568
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:25,372
Here. She'll make you feel good.

569
00:41:25,373 --> 00:41:26,839
This way, Mr. Wayne.

570
00:41:55,202 --> 00:41:58,272
Looking for me, Ray?

571
00:41:58,273 --> 00:42:00,374
You see, now this is what
we need more of around here.

572
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:03,944
All-American kids,
clean-cut kids,

573
00:42:03,945 --> 00:42:07,113
not gutter trash like you, Ramona.

574
00:42:07,114 --> 00:42:08,948
What's your name, kid?

575
00:42:08,949 --> 00:42:12,386
- I'm Daniel.
- Daniel?

576
00:42:12,387 --> 00:42:13,886
Such a nice name.

577
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,888
Leave him alone, Ed.

578
00:42:15,889 --> 00:42:19,124
Just a second.

579
00:42:29,903 --> 00:42:32,072
Danny.

580
00:42:37,746 --> 00:42:41,814
Look, whatever you do,
just avoid that guy, okay?

581
00:42:41,815 --> 00:42:42,883
He used to be a wrestler.

582
00:42:42,884 --> 00:42:46,120
Now he's into pimping
out little boys like you.

583
00:42:46,121 --> 00:42:48,020
- Hey, you listening to me?
- Yeah, I heard you.

584
00:42:48,021 --> 00:42:51,325
They don't call him
The Skull for no reason!

585
00:42:51,326 --> 00:42:52,993
Skull. Right, right, right.

586
00:42:52,994 --> 00:42:55,262
Come on.

587
00:42:57,331 --> 00:43:00,134
Hector, two sunshines.

588
00:43:00,135 --> 00:43:02,970
Hello, Danny, dear.

589
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:04,837
What do you think of this
nasty little gay place?

590
00:43:04,838 --> 00:43:07,174
Cute, isn't it?

591
00:43:07,175 --> 00:43:09,109
- Yeah.
- You're lucky.

592
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:12,513
People in New York like a
straight-looking boy like you.

593
00:43:12,514 --> 00:43:14,515
You can do very well down here.

594
00:43:14,516 --> 00:43:17,117
I need to go to the ladies' room.

595
00:43:18,418 --> 00:43:20,354
No.

596
00:43:20,355 --> 00:43:22,488
Don't drink the nasty booze here.

597
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:25,192
They don't have running water.
We'll be getting hepatitis.

598
00:43:25,193 --> 00:43:26,192
They don't have running water?

599
00:43:26,193 --> 00:43:28,861
Take the beer. It's in a bottle.

600
00:43:28,862 --> 00:43:31,298
Oh.

601
00:43:37,505 --> 00:43:39,305
You got a quarter, mama?

602
00:43:39,306 --> 00:43:41,441
Only for you, honey.

603
00:43:41,442 --> 00:43:43,811
Light me up!

604
00:44:09,336 --> 00:44:12,071
Do you like my shoes, darling?

605
00:44:12,072 --> 00:44:14,575
They were on sale at Lord & Taylor.

606
00:44:14,576 --> 00:44:15,908
Take this.

607
00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:18,912
Freshly cleaned and only smells of me.

608
00:44:18,913 --> 00:44:21,515
You wanna change?

609
00:44:21,516 --> 00:44:24,350
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

610
00:44:24,351 --> 00:44:26,520
Forget it!

611
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:32,226
Come on, Danny, dance with me.

612
00:44:40,568 --> 00:44:43,236
- Dance with me!
- Hey, I don't wanna dance.

613
00:44:43,237 --> 00:44:46,272
What? Are you ashamed to dance with me?

614
00:44:46,273 --> 00:44:50,910
No. I just don't feel like dancing. Okay?

615
00:44:50,911 --> 00:44:55,115
Okay. Maybe later.

616
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:13,125
What the fuck?

617
00:46:37,217 --> 00:46:39,018
Hey.

618
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:40,354
Hi.

619
00:46:40,355 --> 00:46:42,488
I'm Trevor.

620
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:44,691
I'm Danny.

621
00:46:44,692 --> 00:46:49,063
You know, you look like
you need a little rescuing.

622
00:46:50,097 --> 00:46:52,365
Maybe just a little.

623
00:46:53,601 --> 00:46:57,236
So, um, this particular shithole

624
00:46:57,237 --> 00:47:01,073
does not look like Danny's natural habitat.

625
00:47:01,074 --> 00:47:04,978
Now that is a very interesting picture.

626
00:47:09,449 --> 00:47:12,551
If I were to ask you to dance with me,

627
00:47:12,552 --> 00:47:15,522
despite this being a particular shithole,

628
00:47:15,523 --> 00:47:17,357
what would you say?

629
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:21,595
Um, no, really. I'm a terrible dancer.

630
00:47:21,596 --> 00:47:24,263
I mean, my little sister,
she's always telling me

631
00:47:24,264 --> 00:47:28,535
I dance like Frankenstein's monster.

632
00:47:28,536 --> 00:47:30,570
Come on, Danny.

633
00:47:36,376 --> 00:47:39,212
Okay.

634
00:47:39,213 --> 00:47:41,515
All right.

635
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:02,736
What's wrong? Why you so sad?

636
00:48:02,737 --> 00:48:04,404
Who's that guy?

637
00:48:04,405 --> 00:48:06,105
His name is Trevor.

638
00:48:06,106 --> 00:48:09,442
He's very political.

639
00:48:09,443 --> 00:48:11,511
And he clearly has money.

640
00:48:11,512 --> 00:48:12,779
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

641
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,513
Maybe your Danny Boy has found his way

642
00:48:14,514 --> 00:48:17,317
without your help after all.

643
00:48:17,318 --> 00:48:19,718
Mmm.

644
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:21,520
So if you hate this place so much,

645
00:48:21,521 --> 00:48:23,323
what are you doing here?

646
00:48:23,324 --> 00:48:25,625
I'm writing an article about the Stonewall.

647
00:48:25,626 --> 00:48:27,194
You're a writer?

648
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:30,663
No, I'm a member of the Mattachine Society.

649
00:48:30,664 --> 00:48:32,866
What's that?

650
00:48:32,867 --> 00:48:36,569
We're an organization
that fights for gay rights.

651
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:39,506
Take Stonewall, for example.

652
00:48:39,507 --> 00:48:41,508
You know it's run by crooks

653
00:48:41,509 --> 00:48:45,444
who rip off and poison gay men.

654
00:48:45,445 --> 00:48:48,449
We deserve the right to own our own clubs.

655
00:48:54,387 --> 00:48:56,489
Just relax.

656
00:49:11,706 --> 00:49:13,540
- All right, it's a raid!
- Fuck!

657
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:16,276
Let's go! Up against the wall.

658
00:49:16,277 --> 00:49:18,511
- Come on. Get back.
- All right, ladies.

659
00:49:18,512 --> 00:49:21,348
You know the drill, huh? IDs, please.

660
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:24,683
Get in a line up against the walls.

661
00:49:24,684 --> 00:49:26,585
This'll all be over in a second.

662
00:49:26,586 --> 00:49:28,187
They only arrest the trannies.

663
00:49:28,188 --> 00:49:30,290
It's the "three article of clothing" rule.

664
00:49:30,291 --> 00:49:31,558
They're also gonna arrest the dykes

665
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:33,392
because they're wearing men's clothes.

666
00:49:33,393 --> 00:49:36,730
This is what we're fighting
against, this bullshit.

667
00:49:36,731 --> 00:49:38,931
No, no. You stay right there, okay.

668
00:49:38,932 --> 00:49:40,600
You should come to one of our meetings.

669
00:49:40,601 --> 00:49:42,535
Around the corner on Christopher Street.

670
00:49:42,536 --> 00:49:44,203
I'll be seeing you, Danny.

671
00:49:44,204 --> 00:49:46,372
Let's see some IDs here.

672
00:49:46,373 --> 00:49:49,342
Ray. Ray.

673
00:49:53,313 --> 00:49:56,249
If any of you Lily Law girls wanna dance,

674
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,283
well, here I am.

675
00:49:58,452 --> 00:49:59,886
Ten cents a dance.

676
00:49:59,887 --> 00:50:01,654
For all men in uniforms...

677
00:50:01,655 --> 00:50:02,955
Out of here. Let's go.

678
00:50:04,724 --> 00:50:07,627
Life is free!

679
00:50:07,628 --> 00:50:10,296
Life is free!

680
00:50:10,297 --> 00:50:12,799
Hey, ain't your mother
never teach you no respect?

681
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,834
Jesus, God!

682
00:50:14,835 --> 00:50:16,636
What a fuckin' disgrace you are.

683
00:50:16,637 --> 00:50:18,270
More than you?

684
00:50:18,271 --> 00:50:19,672
I know y'all pigs get paid off

685
00:50:19,673 --> 00:50:20,874
every time you raid this place.

686
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:22,308
I probably paid for all

687
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:23,442
of your kids' Christmas presents.

688
00:50:23,443 --> 00:50:24,977
Oh, Jesus Christ!

689
00:50:24,978 --> 00:50:26,613
Fuck, man!

690
00:50:26,614 --> 00:50:27,913
You fuckin' mention my kids, huh?

691
00:50:27,914 --> 00:50:29,884
Officer!

692
00:50:31,552 --> 00:50:36,522
Well, mister,

693
00:50:36,523 --> 00:50:40,560
I actually only have

694
00:50:40,561 --> 00:50:43,964
one item of clothing.

695
00:50:43,965 --> 00:50:45,598
I made it myself.

696
00:50:50,905 --> 00:50:52,839
Isn't it gorgeous?

697
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,941
Get this bitch out of my sight!

698
00:50:54,942 --> 00:50:57,544
Get your hands off me!

699
00:50:59,847 --> 00:51:01,747
I want everybody's ID
or everybody's cuffed.

700
00:51:01,748 --> 00:51:04,684
I want some ID right now.

701
00:51:08,556 --> 00:51:12,259
Get out of here. I want some ID!

702
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,526
Fuck! Danny! Ow!

703
00:51:13,527 --> 00:51:15,027
Shit!

704
00:51:15,028 --> 00:51:16,495
- Ray!
- Danny!

705
00:51:16,496 --> 00:51:17,497
- You wanna go, too?
- Okay, okay.

706
00:51:20,501 --> 00:51:22,334
Fairy queens of Sheridan Square are here.

707
00:51:22,335 --> 00:51:23,870
Just my fuckin' luck.

708
00:51:23,871 --> 00:51:25,504
Hi, Sam.

709
00:51:25,505 --> 00:51:27,540
No sign of Murphy.

710
00:51:27,541 --> 00:51:28,607
Somebody tipped him off.

711
00:51:28,608 --> 00:51:30,610
Maybe.

712
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,747
Who's that guy?

713
00:51:33,748 --> 00:51:35,948
- Fields?
- That sergeant out of the 6th.

714
00:51:35,949 --> 00:51:37,683
He's a good man.

715
00:51:37,684 --> 00:51:39,618
Is he?

716
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:41,321
Well, that'd be a new one
because the information I have

717
00:51:41,322 --> 00:51:44,291
is the whole fuckin' precinct is rotten.

718
00:51:46,594 --> 00:51:48,628
Keep an eye on him.

719
00:51:49,764 --> 00:51:50,897
- Here.
- Thanks.

720
00:51:50,898 --> 00:51:52,399
Why are they doing this?

721
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,966
I don't know, Sam,

722
00:51:53,967 --> 00:51:56,636
but it's getting very, very predictable.

723
00:51:56,637 --> 00:51:58,937
What else is there but to
enjoy the parade, right?

724
00:51:58,938 --> 00:52:01,040
Enjoy it? I can't get arrested.

725
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:02,841
I have kids. I have a husband.

726
00:52:02,842 --> 00:52:04,444
Fuck!

727
00:52:04,445 --> 00:52:07,046
You don't know what you're
fuckin' talking about!

728
00:52:07,047 --> 00:52:08,747
Sir, sir!

729
00:52:08,748 --> 00:52:10,417
What precinct are they going to?

730
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:11,817
Sir?

731
00:52:11,818 --> 00:52:15,055
Jesus Christ! Come on! Get off of me!

732
00:52:15,056 --> 00:52:16,055
Hi, mommy!

733
00:52:16,056 --> 00:52:17,424
Hmm.

734
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,658
Oh!

735
00:52:18,659 --> 00:52:20,593
You okay?

736
00:52:20,594 --> 00:52:24,330
Jesus, Jack. We do the raids.

737
00:52:24,331 --> 00:52:28,401
This our... This is our gig.

738
00:52:28,402 --> 00:52:29,902
Who's this Pine anyway?

739
00:52:29,903 --> 00:52:32,439
Look, he's new. He's
a total straight arrow.

740
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,073
Yeah, just our luck, huh?

741
00:52:34,074 --> 00:52:36,442
Hey, hey! That's my lipstick.

742
00:52:36,443 --> 00:52:38,444
Get your pig hands off
my lipstick, motherfucker!

743
00:52:38,445 --> 00:52:42,681
It ain't no deadly fuckin' weapon, bitch.

744
00:52:42,682 --> 00:52:45,484
Can you spare a cigarette for a lady?

745
00:52:45,485 --> 00:52:47,453
Start with this one.

746
00:52:47,454 --> 00:52:49,622
Interpol has asked us to
look into the Stonewall.

747
00:52:49,623 --> 00:52:51,024
This dump?

748
00:52:51,025 --> 00:52:51,991
Yeah. Apparently some
bonds disappeared from

749
00:52:51,992 --> 00:52:53,426
the Federal Depository,

750
00:52:53,427 --> 00:52:55,361
then they appeared somewhere in Europe.

751
00:52:55,362 --> 00:52:57,029
Interpol thinks that Ed's got some of those

752
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:59,031
nelly Wall Street boys, who hang out here,

753
00:52:59,032 --> 00:53:00,700
by the balls and he's squeezing them.

754
00:53:00,701 --> 00:53:02,535
It's a fuckin' sewer,

755
00:53:02,536 --> 00:53:04,771
and you're up to your neck in it, Walt.

756
00:53:17,117 --> 00:53:19,485
Don't blow smoke in my face.

757
00:53:21,688 --> 00:53:22,988
Look, you cooperate with me,

758
00:53:22,989 --> 00:53:25,024
you'll be out of here in a few minutes.

759
00:53:25,025 --> 00:53:26,459
That's new.

760
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,460
I need to know about Ed Murphy.

761
00:53:28,461 --> 00:53:29,462
Who?

762
00:53:29,463 --> 00:53:32,832
Hey, you know exactly
who I'm talking about.

763
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:33,933
Has he asked you to be bait?

764
00:53:33,934 --> 00:53:36,502
Bait? Like for fishing?

765
00:53:36,503 --> 00:53:38,171
Can we skip the cute part?

766
00:53:38,172 --> 00:53:40,406
You know what happens
to kids who play dumb?

767
00:53:40,407 --> 00:53:42,342
What?

768
00:53:44,945 --> 00:53:47,814
You know this kid?

769
00:53:47,815 --> 00:53:50,582
- No.
- Justin Blake,

770
00:53:50,583 --> 00:53:53,486
17 years old from Port
Jefferson, Long Island.

771
00:53:53,487 --> 00:53:55,187
A frequent customer at the Stonewall

772
00:53:55,188 --> 00:53:57,524
and a very desirable piece of hustler ass,

773
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:59,626
wouldn't you say?

774
00:54:02,128 --> 00:54:03,996
What happened to him?

775
00:54:05,532 --> 00:54:07,634
This.

776
00:54:16,911 --> 00:54:19,479
Now we think that's Ed Murphy's handiwork.

777
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,046
One of the tricks he was
running out of the bar.

778
00:54:21,047 --> 00:54:23,082
So what do you need me for? Go get him.

779
00:54:23,083 --> 00:54:24,183
What do you know about this?

780
00:54:24,184 --> 00:54:25,819
I told you. I don't know nothing.

781
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,520
You're fuckin' lying to me

782
00:54:27,521 --> 00:54:29,589
'cause I can see it in your eyes.

783
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:32,225
What are you protecting?
This guy's a piece of shit.

784
00:54:32,226 --> 00:54:34,993
He kills kids.

785
00:54:34,994 --> 00:54:36,830
Help me.

786
00:54:36,831 --> 00:54:39,032
Help me, please!

787
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:46,573
What the fuck is wrong with you people?

788
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:48,741
Are all of you just stupid,
is that part of being gay?

789
00:54:48,742 --> 00:54:50,243
No!

790
00:54:50,244 --> 00:54:51,910
But getting fucked up by
the cops sure seems to be.

791
00:54:51,911 --> 00:54:55,515
I know. I'm sorry.

792
00:54:56,916 --> 00:54:58,918
You can go.

793
00:55:02,121 --> 00:55:04,223
Here's my card,

794
00:55:04,224 --> 00:55:07,493
if you decide to remember anything.

795
00:55:07,494 --> 00:55:09,630
Go.

796
00:55:17,938 --> 00:55:20,205
Oh, no, I'm not talking to you.

797
00:55:20,206 --> 00:55:22,075
At all.

798
00:55:22,076 --> 00:55:23,743
I just waited a whole night for you.

799
00:55:23,744 --> 00:55:27,747
Oh, she waited all night.
How Cinde-fucking-rella!

800
00:55:27,748 --> 00:55:30,683
What have I done?

801
00:55:30,684 --> 00:55:32,551
You danced with that guy?

802
00:55:32,552 --> 00:55:33,486
Don't think I don't
know anything about him.

803
00:55:33,487 --> 00:55:35,154
His name is Trevor, and he likes to impress

804
00:55:35,155 --> 00:55:38,191
little boys like you with his politics,

805
00:55:38,192 --> 00:55:41,127
when all he really wants to do is fuck you.

806
00:55:41,128 --> 00:55:42,662
God, are you jealous?

807
00:55:42,663 --> 00:55:44,096
- Oh, please!
- Come on!

808
00:55:44,097 --> 00:55:46,598
He's so smooth. He's so smart.

809
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:48,100
You know what I learned about smart people?

810
00:55:48,101 --> 00:55:50,636
They care about one thing, themselves.

811
00:55:50,637 --> 00:55:52,038
Hey, come on.

812
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:53,605
All right. I'm sorry I
danced with him, all right?

813
00:55:53,606 --> 00:55:54,774
Yeah.

814
00:55:54,775 --> 00:55:57,243
How about I buy us breakfast?
We'll go to Big Daddy's.

815
00:55:57,244 --> 00:55:59,145
Look, I got more than $5 left.

816
00:55:59,146 --> 00:56:02,549
I never noticed you were such a rich man.

817
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:05,250
You can have whatever you want.

818
00:56:05,251 --> 00:56:07,152
Baby, you know that's not true,

819
00:56:07,153 --> 00:56:08,788
but it's sweet that
they raise boys in Kansas

820
00:56:08,789 --> 00:56:10,656
to be such gentlemen.

821
00:56:10,657 --> 00:56:14,326
Yeah, right. Yeah, in
Kansas they do. Right.

822
00:56:14,327 --> 00:56:15,828
You do know who the most important person

823
00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:18,964
in Kansas is now? Dorothy.

824
00:56:18,965 --> 00:56:21,000
Dorothy Gale.

825
00:56:22,735 --> 00:56:24,971
From the <i>Wizard of Oz?</i>

826
00:56:24,972 --> 00:56:27,975
Jesus! You don't know nothing, do you?

827
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:36,683
So, we will be meeting
here three nights a week,

828
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:37,716
same time,

829
00:56:37,717 --> 00:56:39,585
and at the end of this,

830
00:56:39,586 --> 00:56:42,689
you will receive three
credits towards your diploma.

831
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,158
If you should miss three classes,

832
00:56:45,159 --> 00:56:47,694
you will be automatically failed.

833
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,662
Any questions?

834
00:57:05,346 --> 00:57:07,813
Lee.

835
00:57:11,184 --> 00:57:13,653
Who's that?

836
00:57:25,065 --> 00:57:26,899
He, uh, he wants you.

837
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,401
What? What do you mean?

838
00:57:28,402 --> 00:57:31,638
Well, he fancies you, man.
He's one of my regulars.

839
00:57:31,639 --> 00:57:33,805
Didn't you say you're out of cash?

840
00:57:33,806 --> 00:57:35,741
- Here's your chance.
- Come on, man.

841
00:57:35,742 --> 00:57:37,810
Oh, no, man. No. Come on! That's not my...

842
00:57:37,811 --> 00:57:39,946
- I don't do that, man.
- His name is Jack.

843
00:57:39,947 --> 00:57:41,080
He's an accountant with a wife

844
00:57:41,081 --> 00:57:42,415
and a bunch of kids, all right?

845
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:44,917
Now I told him that you're
new and it's gonna be $25,

846
00:57:44,918 --> 00:57:46,752
but he's gonna try to get
you to settle for less,

847
00:57:46,753 --> 00:57:48,221
- just don't let that happen.
- Twenty-five?

848
00:57:48,222 --> 00:57:50,957
Yeah, man. He's just gonna
suck you off. That's it.

849
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:54,027
Look, it's nothing, okay? Just go!

850
00:57:55,963 --> 00:57:58,797
Have fun, man.

851
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:00,732
Hey. I'm Danny.

852
00:58:00,733 --> 00:58:03,869
Nice to meet you. I'm Jack.

853
00:58:33,132 --> 00:58:35,100
Jack, do you think maybe I could have

854
00:58:35,101 --> 00:58:36,835
my money first, please?

855
00:58:36,836 --> 00:58:37,970
- Your money?
- Yeah.

856
00:58:37,971 --> 00:58:40,239
Oh, yes. Sure.

857
00:58:42,909 --> 00:58:44,410
It was 15, right?

858
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:46,913
No, Lee said 25.

859
00:58:46,914 --> 00:58:48,915
Oh, yeah.

860
00:58:52,351 --> 00:58:54,253
Thanks.

861
00:59:35,362 --> 00:59:37,763
Hey, Danny.

862
00:59:37,764 --> 00:59:39,865
Here.

863
00:59:41,835 --> 00:59:44,471
Still hanging out with your
little street gang, huh?

864
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:47,038
What have you got against them?

865
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:51,276
Nothing. It's just...

866
00:59:51,277 --> 00:59:52,511
You don't seem like the type of guy

867
00:59:52,512 --> 00:59:53,413
who wants to hang out at the Stonewall

868
00:59:53,414 --> 00:59:55,448
and turn tricks with your girlfriends.

869
00:59:55,449 --> 00:59:58,417
You know, wearing red
lipstick, nail polish.

870
00:59:58,418 --> 01:00:01,087
Well that's because red's not my color.

871
01:00:01,088 --> 01:00:02,921
They've been better friends
to me than most of the people

872
01:00:02,922 --> 01:00:05,357
I thought were my friends my whole life.

873
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:07,760
That's 'cause you didn't
have the right friends.

874
01:00:08,961 --> 01:00:10,796
Come to the meeting.

875
01:00:10,797 --> 01:00:14,500
We got shitty coffee, crappy cookies.

876
01:00:44,965 --> 01:00:47,067
Ray?

877
01:00:48,402 --> 01:00:50,269
Ray?

878
01:00:59,012 --> 01:01:01,314
Oh, Jesus! What happened?

879
01:01:01,315 --> 01:01:03,383
Who did this to you?

880
01:01:04,918 --> 01:01:08,386
What do you mean, "Who did this?"

881
01:01:08,387 --> 01:01:11,890
If you're lucky, they pay you for it.

882
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,595
Stop tricking, Ray.

883
01:01:15,596 --> 01:01:18,064
And then what?

884
01:01:18,065 --> 01:01:20,232
What?

885
01:01:20,233 --> 01:01:22,201
Tell me!

886
01:01:23,503 --> 01:01:27,374
You wanna know where home is for me, Danny?

887
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:32,944
Nowhere.

888
01:01:32,945 --> 01:01:38,651
There is no home. There
is no family, Danny.

889
01:01:38,652 --> 01:01:41,287
All there is,

890
01:01:41,288 --> 01:01:44,290
is some guy in fuckin' Sing Sing

891
01:01:44,291 --> 01:01:46,359
who might be my dad,

892
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:50,029
and I don't know where my mom is.

893
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:55,134
My sister, she's in foster care,

894
01:01:55,135 --> 01:02:00,138
and I got a dead grandma in Ponce.

895
01:02:00,139 --> 01:02:03,142
Happy fuckin' family!

896
01:02:03,143 --> 01:02:05,977
What the fuck am I supposed to do, Danny?

897
01:02:05,978 --> 01:02:09,114
Nobody wants me!

898
01:02:11,251 --> 01:02:13,218
Nobody!

899
01:02:13,219 --> 01:02:16,288
Not even you!

900
01:02:16,289 --> 01:02:19,625
I don't have anything!

901
01:02:19,626 --> 01:02:20,759
So what...

902
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,261
So what if I fuckin' get
beat up every now and then?

903
01:02:23,262 --> 01:02:25,463
Who the fuck doesn't?

904
01:02:27,266 --> 01:02:31,404
A faggot is always going to
get beat up, Danny, even you.

905
01:02:31,405 --> 01:02:34,073
Either from another faggot,

906
01:02:34,074 --> 01:02:36,142
or from a cop,

907
01:02:36,143 --> 01:02:39,477
or from a trick,

908
01:02:39,478 --> 01:02:42,448
who's got something to prove.

909
01:02:42,449 --> 01:02:44,451
No big deal.

910
01:02:48,322 --> 01:02:49,988
Maybe I can look, you know?

911
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:57,029
Maybe I can look and see if I
can find us something better.

912
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:59,599
Why do you care?

913
01:03:01,568 --> 01:03:03,102
Because you're my friend.

914
01:03:03,103 --> 01:03:05,472
What?

915
01:03:07,273 --> 01:03:09,909
Because you're my friend.

916
01:03:13,347 --> 01:03:16,316
I'm sorry.

917
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:19,651
Come here.

918
01:03:19,652 --> 01:03:22,254
I'm sorry.

919
01:03:22,255 --> 01:03:24,357
Come here. Come here. Shh! Shh!

920
01:03:32,699 --> 01:03:34,066
I'm tired.

921
01:03:54,086 --> 01:03:55,788
- Wake up!
- What? What?

922
01:03:55,789 --> 01:03:58,556
So, did he give this to you?

923
01:03:58,557 --> 01:04:00,225
No, some other guy gave it to me.

924
01:04:00,226 --> 01:04:02,727
Why are you lying to me?

925
01:04:02,728 --> 01:04:05,031
What?

926
01:04:05,032 --> 01:04:07,701
Oh, give it a rest, Ray, please.

927
01:04:10,369 --> 01:04:13,671
You know, Danny,

928
01:04:13,672 --> 01:04:17,743
you're turning out to be
a real New York cocksucker.

929
01:04:17,744 --> 01:04:21,213
Learning how to lie before
you even get dressed!

930
01:04:26,152 --> 01:04:28,754
What the fuck was that?

931
01:04:33,592 --> 01:04:36,162
<i>More and more we are
seeing that homosexuals</i>

932
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:39,431
<i>will no longer tolerate
discrimination.</i>

933
01:04:39,432 --> 01:04:43,803
<i>People will recognize
that gay is good.</i>

934
01:04:43,804 --> 01:04:47,105
<i>The American people
will start to understand</i>

935
01:04:47,106 --> 01:04:52,210
<i>that firing us for being
gay is just plain wrong,</i>

936
01:04:52,211 --> 01:04:55,414
<i>and that is the day
we are working for.</i>

937
01:04:57,117 --> 01:04:59,417
<i>But we have to fight
in a peaceful way</i>

938
01:04:59,418 --> 01:05:01,520
<i>and resist the radicalism</i>

939
01:05:01,521 --> 01:05:04,156
<i>that I see starting to
take hold in some quarters.</i>

940
01:05:04,157 --> 01:05:05,758
<i>Don't forget,</i>

941
01:05:05,759 --> 01:05:08,560
<i>wearing a suit and tie
will make them understand</i>

942
01:05:08,561 --> 01:05:10,261
<i>you're just like them...</i>

943
01:05:10,262 --> 01:05:13,333
<i>That's how we win!</i>

944
01:05:17,369 --> 01:05:19,404
With the new appointments to the Court,

945
01:05:19,405 --> 01:05:20,738
we're pretty optimistic

946
01:05:20,739 --> 01:05:23,341
that the right action
in the right jurisdiction

947
01:05:23,342 --> 01:05:26,178
might actually get us a little
closer to where we want to go.

948
01:05:26,179 --> 01:05:27,613
Um, excuse me.

949
01:05:27,614 --> 01:05:29,114
Do you mind if I ask you a quick question?

950
01:05:29,115 --> 01:05:30,316
Not at all.

951
01:05:30,317 --> 01:05:32,218
Um, you're an astronomer, right?

952
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:33,785
By training, yes, I am.

953
01:05:33,786 --> 01:05:35,488
I'm actually going to Columbia in the fall

954
01:05:35,489 --> 01:05:36,622
and was hoping to do the same thing,

955
01:05:36,623 --> 01:05:39,325
and maybe end up at NASA.

956
01:05:39,326 --> 01:05:42,194
I was wondering if you
might have some advice or...

957
01:05:42,195 --> 01:05:44,163
They fired me.

958
01:05:44,164 --> 01:05:46,364
You can't be a homosexual
and work for the government.

959
01:05:46,365 --> 01:05:49,502
You're going to have
to find something else.

960
01:05:49,503 --> 01:05:52,404
We're not there yet, I'm sad to say.

961
01:05:52,405 --> 01:05:55,774
Sorry. But we will be.

962
01:05:55,775 --> 01:05:59,645
It's a long journey, a long road.

963
01:05:59,646 --> 01:06:02,348
Right. Thank you, sir.

964
01:06:02,349 --> 01:06:04,884
Thank you.

965
01:06:04,885 --> 01:06:06,753
Hey, Danny.

966
01:06:08,521 --> 01:06:10,156
Thanks for coming.

967
01:06:10,157 --> 01:06:12,323
Yeah. It was great.

968
01:06:12,324 --> 01:06:13,591
I mean, aside from being told
that what I want to be in life

969
01:06:13,592 --> 01:06:15,493
isn't available to me because I'm gay.

970
01:06:15,494 --> 01:06:19,364
Sure. That's what we're trying to change.

971
01:06:19,365 --> 01:06:20,566
People like Frank Kameny

972
01:06:20,567 --> 01:06:22,234
have been fighting this battle for years.

973
01:06:22,235 --> 01:06:24,236
No one has done as much
for our cause as he has.

974
01:06:24,237 --> 01:06:26,238
What, by wearing a suit and tie?

975
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:27,339
Come on!

976
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:28,741
Is that really what you want?

977
01:06:28,742 --> 01:06:29,875
To blend in?

978
01:06:29,876 --> 01:06:32,410
I mean, we are different, right?

979
01:06:32,411 --> 01:06:33,678
You know, I'm beginning to realize

980
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:34,879
just how different we really are.

981
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,381
Yeah, like wearing a dress

982
01:06:36,382 --> 01:06:38,384
and prancing up and
down Christopher Street?

983
01:06:38,385 --> 01:06:40,386
Hey, it takes a lot more
balls to wear a dress

984
01:06:40,387 --> 01:06:42,555
than it does a suit and tie.

985
01:06:42,556 --> 01:06:43,888
What would you have me do, huh?

986
01:06:43,889 --> 01:06:46,524
Be a fuckin' florist or decorator?

987
01:06:47,793 --> 01:06:49,328
Come on!

988
01:06:49,329 --> 01:06:52,330
What, are these the options open to me?

989
01:06:52,331 --> 01:06:55,366
Of course not.

990
01:06:55,367 --> 01:06:58,370
You know, I'm getting to really feel like

991
01:06:58,371 --> 01:07:00,839
I just want to break something, you know?

992
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:03,209
Me too.

993
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:05,977
But you're not gonna, are you?

994
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:07,680
Ever.

995
01:07:07,681 --> 01:07:10,582
Look...

996
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:12,484
Why don't you let me buy you some dinner?

997
01:07:12,485 --> 01:07:15,921
I don't know about you,
but I'm starving. Come on.

998
01:07:15,922 --> 01:07:19,558
My folks are liberals,

999
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:22,261
or maybe I just outwitted them.

1000
01:07:22,262 --> 01:07:23,761
You outwitted them. What did you tell them?

1001
01:07:23,762 --> 01:07:25,296
Let me get this straight.

1002
01:07:25,297 --> 01:07:27,866
Your version of fairness and equality

1003
01:07:27,867 --> 01:07:29,767
ends with who you sleep with?

1004
01:07:29,768 --> 01:07:31,904
That's nuts.

1005
01:07:31,905 --> 01:07:34,372
So every family dinner,
I just threw it at them

1006
01:07:34,373 --> 01:07:36,308
until they surrendered.

1007
01:07:36,309 --> 01:07:38,743
That's how you do it.

1008
01:07:38,744 --> 01:07:40,613
- With words.
- Wow.

1009
01:07:40,614 --> 01:07:41,747
I mean, my family is like,

1010
01:07:41,748 --> 01:07:43,781
"He's turned to a pillar of salt."

1011
01:07:43,782 --> 01:07:47,653
Danny, you can't let them shame you.

1012
01:07:49,556 --> 01:07:50,888
I miss them so much,

1013
01:07:50,889 --> 01:07:54,493
especially my little sister, you know.

1014
01:07:54,494 --> 01:07:58,696
All of that just taken away
from me because I got caught.

1015
01:07:58,697 --> 01:08:00,799
With some guy?

1016
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:04,636
No, not some guy.

1017
01:08:04,637 --> 01:08:08,707
I've known Joe my whole life.

1018
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:11,576
I was in love with him.

1019
01:08:11,577 --> 01:08:14,913
You know, when we got busted, he just...

1020
01:08:14,914 --> 01:08:17,950
Turned his back on you.

1021
01:08:17,951 --> 01:08:20,818
Yeah... And you left.

1022
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:22,654
Why didn't you fight back?

1023
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:24,657
Do you know anything
about life in a small town

1024
01:08:24,658 --> 01:08:26,492
and what happens to you

1025
01:08:26,493 --> 01:08:28,394
when you suddenly become disgusting?

1026
01:08:31,664 --> 01:08:35,434
You will never be disgusting,

1027
01:08:35,435 --> 01:08:39,438
and I really wanna know everything.

1028
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:41,908
Everything about you.

1029
01:09:49,676 --> 01:09:51,143
Hey.

1030
01:09:51,144 --> 01:09:53,812
Hey.

1031
01:09:53,813 --> 01:09:56,015
I don't want you to go.

1032
01:09:59,418 --> 01:10:02,987
Look, I know this is sudden,

1033
01:10:02,988 --> 01:10:05,758
but you need a safe place to stay.

1034
01:10:05,759 --> 01:10:08,894
Why don't you just stay here, with me?

1035
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:11,831
You know, for a little while.

1036
01:10:17,436 --> 01:10:19,170
You still drunk, or are
you just talking shit?

1037
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:23,175
No.

1038
01:10:23,176 --> 01:10:24,843
You can get a job,

1039
01:10:24,844 --> 01:10:28,013
start paying me some rent
so it doesn't feel weird.

1040
01:10:28,014 --> 01:10:29,947
Look, Danny.

1041
01:10:29,948 --> 01:10:33,885
Something happened to me when
I saw you at the Stonewall.

1042
01:10:35,822 --> 01:10:38,524
I kind of fell into deep water.

1043
01:10:40,693 --> 01:10:43,996
So stay, okay?

1044
01:10:49,836 --> 01:10:52,004
Winters' residence.

1045
01:10:52,005 --> 01:10:53,839
<i>Danny?</i>

1046
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,773
Are you still in New York?

1047
01:10:55,774 --> 01:10:58,076
Yes, Mom. Look, I called for Phoebe, okay?

1048
01:10:58,077 --> 01:11:00,144
Are you all right?

1049
01:11:00,145 --> 01:11:02,915
I pray for you, every day.

1050
01:11:02,916 --> 01:11:04,983
I don't need you to pray for me, Mom.

1051
01:11:04,984 --> 01:11:07,553
I need you to sign my goddamn
scholarship application

1052
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:08,853
<i>and send it in, all right?</i>

1053
01:11:08,854 --> 01:11:10,822
<i>That will be a lot
better than prayers.</i>

1054
01:11:12,192 --> 01:11:15,994
Can you please just get Phebes, all right?

1055
01:11:17,997 --> 01:11:20,800
Phoebe, it's Danny on the phone.

1056
01:11:26,104 --> 01:11:29,007
Danny, Danny! Hold on.

1057
01:11:31,109 --> 01:11:32,211
<i>Got it?</i>

1058
01:11:32,212 --> 01:11:34,479
Trevor Nichols.

1059
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,947
Okay. Got it.

1060
01:11:35,948 --> 01:11:37,916
So how's it going, Phebes?

1061
01:11:37,917 --> 01:11:42,054
Mom and Dad are fighting every day.

1062
01:11:42,055 --> 01:11:43,956
I stopped talking to either one of them.

1063
01:11:43,957 --> 01:11:44,889
<i>I just can't wait
to get out of here.</i>

1064
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:46,692
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

1065
01:11:46,693 --> 01:11:48,894
Hey, have you met Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis yet?

1066
01:11:48,895 --> 01:11:50,828
Or Andy Warhol?

1067
01:11:50,829 --> 01:11:52,563
Yeah. No, we have lunch
every other day, stupid.

1068
01:11:57,804 --> 01:12:01,907
Look what the cat dragged in.

1069
01:12:01,908 --> 01:12:03,675
Hey, guys.

1070
01:12:03,676 --> 01:12:06,644
So I just want to tell you
all that, um, I got a place

1071
01:12:06,645 --> 01:12:09,113
or somewhere, you know,
to live for a little bit.

1072
01:12:09,114 --> 01:12:10,816
Where?

1073
01:12:10,817 --> 01:12:13,219
It's Trevor's place.

1074
01:12:17,789 --> 01:12:21,527
Oooh, honey, honey, me oh my!

1075
01:12:21,528 --> 01:12:23,295
Columbia's leaving us for good.

1076
01:12:23,296 --> 01:12:25,596
Danny Boy's found himself a nice, rich,

1077
01:12:25,597 --> 01:12:27,532
smart sugar daddy.

1078
01:12:27,533 --> 01:12:29,867
Look, you only been here
for like two months, right?

1079
01:12:29,868 --> 01:12:32,571
Damn! A quick learner, right, girls?

1080
01:12:32,572 --> 01:12:34,072
Maybe you could teach me a trick or two.

1081
01:12:34,073 --> 01:12:35,874
Why are you such an asshole?

1082
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:38,076
No! I'm proud.

1083
01:12:38,077 --> 01:12:39,711
Baby, you played it right,

1084
01:12:39,712 --> 01:12:41,612
moving your little country boy ass indoors.

1085
01:12:41,613 --> 01:12:43,581
And what's wrong with that, huh?

1086
01:12:43,582 --> 01:12:45,783
Well, like your life is so great, Ray?

1087
01:12:45,784 --> 01:12:47,920
Getting beat up all the time
and blowing guys in doorways?

1088
01:12:47,921 --> 01:12:50,656
Yeah! A life of excitement, baby!

1089
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:52,023
You know, the last time I saw you,

1090
01:12:52,024 --> 01:12:54,926
you were begging me to
get out of this life.

1091
01:12:56,261 --> 01:12:58,764
Let me tell you something, hmm?

1092
01:12:58,765 --> 01:13:01,666
The difference between
us, I don't have a choice,

1093
01:13:01,667 --> 01:13:02,934
and you just wanted a little time

1094
01:13:02,935 --> 01:13:04,036
with someone in the streets.

1095
01:13:04,037 --> 01:13:06,037
What, so tricking was just
an adventure in your story?

1096
01:13:06,038 --> 01:13:09,575
I know what this is, this
is a little funny story

1097
01:13:09,576 --> 01:13:15,013
about Ray and Lee and
Paul and Cong and Annie.

1098
01:13:15,014 --> 01:13:18,250
Funny fuckin' story, isn't it?

1099
01:13:18,251 --> 01:13:21,921
Let's go!

1100
01:13:35,702 --> 01:13:37,368
I guess I need my stuff.

1101
01:13:37,369 --> 01:13:39,237
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm sure!

1102
01:13:39,238 --> 01:13:40,371
I can't sit in the park like you all day

1103
01:13:40,372 --> 01:13:42,974
watching the world go by, can I?

1104
01:13:42,975 --> 01:13:44,843
Fuck! I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

1105
01:13:44,844 --> 01:13:46,377
I was rude. I'm sorry.

1106
01:13:46,378 --> 01:13:53,117
Yes, but like a lot of rude
things, very, very true.

1107
01:13:53,118 --> 01:13:55,720
You were in the Navy?

1108
01:13:55,721 --> 01:13:58,657
South Pacific.

1109
01:13:58,658 --> 01:14:00,725
I was 18.

1110
01:14:00,726 --> 01:14:03,327
You had to be a total dick
not to serve in that one.

1111
01:14:03,328 --> 01:14:05,863
But Vietnam, wouldn't go near it.

1112
01:14:05,864 --> 01:14:07,898
Oh, thanks.

1113
01:14:07,899 --> 01:14:09,033
Yeah, I thought about enlisting

1114
01:14:09,034 --> 01:14:10,301
when my parents kicked me out.

1115
01:14:10,302 --> 01:14:11,903
You know, just to spite them.

1116
01:14:11,904 --> 01:14:13,839
You're damn lucky you didn't.

1117
01:14:16,042 --> 01:14:20,379
Look, Ray started tricking in
Times Square when he was 12.

1118
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:22,014
This isn't him being mean to you.

1119
01:14:22,015 --> 01:14:25,317
He just loves you, is all.

1120
01:14:25,318 --> 01:14:27,952
And love isn't always pretty.

1121
01:14:27,953 --> 01:14:30,855
They should put that on a poster.

1122
01:14:30,856 --> 01:14:32,725
He'll get over it.

1123
01:14:34,327 --> 01:14:36,761
Eventually.

1124
01:14:36,762 --> 01:14:38,863
Every guy has to get over
being in love with someone

1125
01:14:38,864 --> 01:14:41,332
who can't love him back.

1126
01:14:41,333 --> 01:14:43,902
What makes you so sure that's what it is?

1127
01:14:43,903 --> 01:14:46,404
I know the look.

1128
01:14:46,405 --> 01:14:48,806
He just needs friends, is all,

1129
01:14:48,807 --> 01:14:50,742
and if he can stick the
endless goddamn abuse,

1130
01:14:50,743 --> 01:14:51,977
he'll be there for you, Danny.

1131
01:14:55,681 --> 01:14:56,814
Hi.

1132
01:14:56,815 --> 01:14:59,184
Hey.

1133
01:15:02,421 --> 01:15:03,755
And he is...

1134
01:15:03,756 --> 01:15:04,889
Danny, Terry.

1135
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:06,724
Terry, Danny.

1136
01:15:06,725 --> 01:15:07,959
- Hi.
- Hi.

1137
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,260
Staying for dinner?

1138
01:15:09,261 --> 01:15:12,363
I'm making spaghetti and meatballs.

1139
01:15:12,364 --> 01:15:14,198
Wait, sorry. You guys live together?

1140
01:15:14,199 --> 01:15:15,300
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

1141
01:15:15,301 --> 01:15:16,702
Haven't killed each other yet,

1142
01:15:16,703 --> 01:15:18,403
even though this is a storage facility

1143
01:15:18,404 --> 01:15:20,371
for every street kid below 14th Street.

1144
01:15:20,372 --> 01:15:22,174
And he loves you a lot
more than he loves me.

1145
01:15:22,175 --> 01:15:23,742
Yep, sure do.

1146
01:15:23,743 --> 01:15:25,010
Mmm-hmm.

1147
01:15:25,011 --> 01:15:26,077
'Cause you're so square.

1148
01:15:26,078 --> 01:15:27,946
How long have you...

1149
01:15:27,947 --> 01:15:32,917
Put up with this bullshit?
Almost four years.

1150
01:15:32,918 --> 01:15:35,120
Stay for dinner. We, uh, love company.

1151
01:15:35,121 --> 01:15:39,256
That just sounds just great,
but I gotta be somewhere.

1152
01:15:39,257 --> 01:15:42,227
Thanks, Bob.

1153
01:15:42,228 --> 01:15:43,228
It was real nice meeting you.

1154
01:15:43,229 --> 01:15:45,431
Nice meeting you, too.

- Hey!

1160
01:16:00,947 --> 01:16:03,047
Guess what?

1161
01:16:03,048 --> 01:16:05,117
Your boyfriend is working
at the Italian grocery store.

1162
01:16:05,118 --> 01:16:07,285
How do you know that?

1163
01:16:07,286 --> 01:16:09,453
'Cause we saw him there.

1164
01:16:09,454 --> 01:16:11,823
Baby, you want a plum?

1165
01:16:18,463 --> 01:16:20,965
So you got a lady's stocking in a size one

1166
01:16:20,966 --> 01:16:23,535
or is that on the other floor, miss?

1167
01:16:23,536 --> 01:16:25,036
No, all right.

1168
01:16:25,037 --> 01:16:27,840
What about a Puerto Rican Koko Blanco bar?

1169
01:16:28,975 --> 01:16:31,041
What do you want, Ray?

1170
01:16:31,042 --> 01:16:35,947
I just need a pack of cigarettes, Danny.

1171
01:16:35,948 --> 01:16:37,314
Look, I wouldn't ask. I'm sorry.

1172
01:16:37,315 --> 01:16:38,383
It's an emergency.

1173
01:16:38,384 --> 01:16:41,286
Ray, I've had this job
for two weeks, all right?

1174
01:16:41,287 --> 01:16:43,487
Danny, Judy just died.

1175
01:16:43,488 --> 01:16:45,857
Judy who?

1176
01:16:45,858 --> 01:16:48,794
Garland!

1177
01:16:48,795 --> 01:16:50,895
- Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
- In London.

1178
01:16:50,896 --> 01:16:52,930
They're flying her body
over to Frank's Mortuary

1179
01:16:52,931 --> 01:16:54,299
on the Upper East Side.

1180
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:57,135
I mean, I'm going to go
pay my respects and...

1181
01:16:57,136 --> 01:16:59,170
I'm sorry, man.

1182
01:16:59,171 --> 01:17:00,971
You won't even give me
a pack of cigarettes?

1183
01:17:00,972 --> 01:17:04,542
Look, Ray, I cannot
lose this job, all right?

1184
01:17:04,543 --> 01:17:06,478
I got rent and stuff to pay now.

1185
01:17:06,479 --> 01:17:09,147
Okay? Oh, come on!

1186
01:17:09,148 --> 01:17:12,216
You just gonna walk away from me like that?

1187
01:17:12,217 --> 01:17:15,821
It's people like you, Danny,
who misunderstood Judy.

1188
01:17:15,822 --> 01:17:17,054
You know, you misunderstand people like me,

1189
01:17:17,055 --> 01:17:18,223
but that's okay.

1190
01:17:18,224 --> 01:17:19,890
That's okay. Don't worry about it.

1191
01:17:19,891 --> 01:17:22,460
Go pay your rent. Talk to your boyfriend.

1192
01:17:22,461 --> 01:17:25,863
Do what you gotta do. Forget it.

1193
01:17:25,864 --> 01:17:27,532
Have a nice one.

1194
01:17:27,533 --> 01:17:29,468
Hey!

1195
01:17:38,077 --> 01:17:40,146
Wait there.

1196
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:44,849
Sorry, sir. Can I get a pack of Dorals?

1197
01:17:48,487 --> 01:17:50,956
- There you go.
- Thanks.

1198
01:17:55,895 --> 01:17:59,096
Can I please get menthol?

1199
01:17:59,097 --> 01:18:01,566
I'm really stressed out. I...

1200
01:18:01,567 --> 01:18:03,201
A pack of menthol, please.

1201
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,376
Thank you.

1202
01:18:12,912 --> 01:18:15,247
Thank you. I...

1203
01:18:17,048 --> 01:18:19,284
I miss you guys, okay?

1204
01:18:22,387 --> 01:18:24,522
Really?

1205
01:18:24,523 --> 01:18:27,059
Of course I do!

1206
01:18:33,032 --> 01:18:35,167
Good!

1207
01:18:44,577 --> 01:18:48,078
Hey, Trevor. I got a letter from Phoebe.

1208
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:50,381
And there's also some stuff here for you.

1209
01:18:50,382 --> 01:18:53,050
From a bank or something.

1210
01:18:53,051 --> 01:18:54,385

Oh, it's so hot.

Yeah, one day, all right?

You just keep trying.

1227

I'm sorry.

1234
01:20:36,421 --> 01:20:38,389
I bit off more than I could chew.

1235
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:39,456
Look, it was a mistake to...

1236

To what? What, to lie to me?

1237

God, you know, you're just
a lot of fuckin' words.

Bob?

1243
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:30,575
You seen Ray?

1244
01:21:30,576 --> 01:21:33,411
No. You okay?

1245
01:21:33,412 --> 01:21:35,246
Yeah.

1246
01:21:35,247 --> 01:21:37,849
Want me to take care of that for you?

1247
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:41,152
Listen, could you, uh, when you see him,

1248
01:21:41,153 --> 01:21:43,321
could you tell Ray I said goodbye?

1249
01:21:43,322 --> 01:21:46,191
- Yeah.
- And thank you.

1250
01:21:46,192 --> 01:21:47,425
You, too.

1251
01:21:47,426 --> 01:21:51,095

pretty good right now.

Don't do anything stupid, Danny.

1256

What...

1260
01:22:16,154 --> 01:22:17,654
Shut up!

1261
01:22:17,655 --> 01:22:21,459
Danny! Hey, hey!

01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:23,494
Hey!

01:22:48,319 --> 01:22:50,255

1264
01:23:00,533 --> 01:23:02,534
Relax, kid.

1265

This is Danny.

1266
01:23:09,408 --> 01:23:12,511
He's the guy what you
gents were asking for.

1267
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:25,422
It's not like you ain't
done this before, kid.

1268
01:23:25,423 --> 01:23:28,292
Just do whatever they ask.

1269
01:23:33,332 --> 01:23:37,202
Please, have a seat.

1270
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:44,542
Let's have some music, shall we?

1271
01:23:52,885 --> 01:23:54,685
Would you like something to drink?

1272
01:23:54,686 --> 01:23:56,254
Um...

1274
01:23:58,256 --> 01:24:00,324
Campari.

1275
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,867
Hey. What did you do with him?

1276
01:24:10,868 --> 01:24:12,937
Get the fuck out of here.

1277
01:24:12,938 --> 01:24:16,573
Oh, but I know all about
you and little Georgina Vee.

1278
01:24:16,574 --> 01:24:18,609
I mean, George Vasquez.

1279
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:20,377
Maybe I should spread the news,

1280
01:24:20,378 --> 01:24:21,946
see what happens.

1281
01:24:21,947 --> 01:24:25,450
A faggot club owner and
a driver for the mob.

1282
01:24:25,451 --> 01:24:27,685
I give it a day.

1283
01:24:50,876 --> 01:24:53,510
I see you've been given a drink.

1284
01:24:53,511 --> 01:24:55,546
Good.

1285
01:24:57,615 --> 01:24:59,850
Danny, right?

1286
01:24:59,851 --> 01:25:04,288
A nice American name.

1287
01:25:04,289 --> 01:25:08,426
Like Scott or Justin.

1288
01:25:10,762 --> 01:25:16,667
I, uh, I wish I could live
in New York, but my work...

1289
01:25:16,668 --> 01:25:19,937
I have to tell you my work is very hard.

1290
01:25:19,938 --> 01:25:24,710
Leaves very little time for pleasure.

1291
01:25:25,844 --> 01:25:28,412
I was in the bedroom
watching <i>The Lucy Show</i>

1292
01:25:28,413 --> 01:25:32,750
and she was struggling so hard

1293
01:25:32,751 --> 01:25:36,086
to put the candies in the box.

1294
01:25:36,087 --> 01:25:37,087
And I understood,

1295
01:25:37,088 --> 01:25:41,559
I understood that
metaphor because that's me.

1296
01:25:43,695 --> 01:25:45,462
I'm always working so hard,

1297
01:25:45,463 --> 01:25:46,831
putting the candies in the box.

1298
01:26:03,948 --> 01:26:05,515
Do you know the Bible, Danny?

1299
01:26:05,516 --> 01:26:06,850
Mmm-hmm.

1300
01:26:06,851 --> 01:26:08,952
Anything from the New Testament?

1301
01:26:08,953 --> 01:26:10,688
- Yeah.
- Ahh.

1302
01:26:10,689 --> 01:26:13,991
The Book of John.

1303
01:26:13,992 --> 01:26:19,596
"You are my friends if you
do what I command of you."

1304
01:26:21,766 --> 01:26:25,969
John 15:14.

1305
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:29,806
Ahh. And I am a good friend, Danny.

01:26:29,807 --> 01:26:36,782
I am a very good friend to nice young boys.

1307
01:26:54,032 --> 01:26:56,501
We have to leave.

1308
01:26:56,502 --> 01:26:58,670
I can't go like this.

1309
01:27:13,786 --> 01:27:16,822
Danny! Danny!

1310
01:27:19,425 --> 01:27:21,058
What the fuck are you doing here?

1311
01:27:21,059 --> 01:27:22,859
What, you didn't notice
there was a fire, man?

1312
01:27:22,860 --> 01:27:24,629
Stop kidding around.
Just get me out of here.

1313
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:26,797
Come on, come on. This way.

1314
01:27:31,703 --> 01:27:34,772
Taxi! Taxi! Whoa!

1315
01:27:34,773 --> 01:27:37,876
Hey, taxi. Hop in.

1316
01:27:40,445 --> 01:27:43,414
Christopher Street, Sheridan Square.

1317
01:27:45,082 --> 01:27:46,917
He had a fuckin' gun, Ray.

1318
01:27:46,918 --> 01:27:50,121
This will not go away, Danny.
We gotta make a deal with him.

1319
01:27:50,122 --> 01:27:51,721
You're gonna make a deal that...

1320
01:27:51,722 --> 01:27:53,457
How do you want to do that?

1321
01:27:53,458 --> 01:27:55,693
I'll handle it, okay?

1322
01:27:57,729 --> 01:28:00,598
How long have they been in there?

1323
01:28:00,599 --> 01:28:01,965
About half an hour.

1324
01:28:01,966 --> 01:28:03,901
Half an hour. Should I be worried?

1325
01:28:03,902 --> 01:28:05,569
Nah. Those girls are vice cops.

1326
01:28:05,570 --> 01:28:07,604
They can handle themselves.

1327
01:28:07,605 --> 01:28:08,906
Keep it.

1328
01:28:08,907 --> 01:28:11,009
- Frankie...
- Who's that kid?

1329
01:28:15,012 --> 01:28:19,584
Where is he? Where is he?

1330
01:28:19,585 --> 01:28:20,885
He's in the back.

1331
01:28:20,886 --> 01:28:22,786
Okay. You guys just stay here, all right?

1332
01:28:37,168 --> 01:28:41,772
I got a call about a fire alarm

1333
01:28:41,773 --> 01:28:44,274
and you running out,

1334
01:28:44,275 --> 01:28:47,778
like some thief in the night.

1335
01:28:47,779 --> 01:28:49,980
You go back there

1336
01:28:49,981 --> 01:28:51,883
and you finish that fuckin' trick.

1337
01:28:51,884 --> 01:28:53,084
He's not going back there, Ed.

1338
01:28:53,085 --> 01:28:55,752
What the fuck is this, hustler love?

1339
01:28:55,753 --> 01:28:58,221
Why do all you guys
gotta be such romantics?

1340
01:28:58,222 --> 01:29:00,992
How about I go to the cops and I tell them

1341
01:29:00,993 --> 01:29:03,995
you were the last person with Justin?

1342
01:29:06,163 --> 01:29:07,999
'Cause that would be
the dumbest fuckin' idea

1343
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,737
you ever had, and probably your last.

1344
01:29:12,738 --> 01:29:17,575
All I'm saying is let Danny go.

1345
01:29:17,576 --> 01:29:20,545
Everybody knows, Ed.
The cops are on to you.

1346
01:29:20,546 --> 01:29:22,145
They can't lay a finger on me.

1347
01:29:22,146 --> 01:29:24,949
Come on. Get off him.

1348
01:29:28,185 --> 01:29:30,020
Now you play close attention to me.

1349
01:29:30,021 --> 01:29:31,188
You get your faggoty ass

1350
01:29:31,189 --> 01:29:33,323
and you get back to that fuckin' trick.

1351
01:29:33,324 --> 01:29:35,992
He likes you. You're lucky.

1352
01:29:35,993 --> 01:29:37,929
Let's do this.

1353
01:29:37,930 --> 01:29:39,130
All units, we're moving in.

1354
01:29:39,131 --> 01:29:41,199
<i>Roger.</i>

1355
01:29:43,935 --> 01:29:46,971
Let's go! Let's go either way.

1356
01:29:48,606 --> 01:29:50,273
Police. We're taking the place.

1357
01:29:50,274 --> 01:29:51,675
But you guys did us a couple days ago.

1358
01:29:51,676 --> 01:29:53,611
I'm aware. That was the 6th.

1359
01:29:53,612 --> 01:29:55,880
I don't take payoffs. I'm Morals.

1360
01:29:58,850 --> 01:30:02,719
Why do I get the impression
you just don't fuckin' get it?

1361
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,889
All right. This is a raid.

1362
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:07,724
All right. Let's go. Up against the walls.

1363
01:30:07,725 --> 01:30:08,858
Ed. Raid.

1364
01:30:08,859 --> 01:30:11,662
We just had a fuckin' raid!

1365
01:30:15,033 --> 01:30:17,867
Where the fuck is the backdoor key?

1366
01:30:17,868 --> 01:30:20,804
I'm not finished with you fuckin' faggots.

1367
01:30:20,805 --> 01:30:22,706
Get out your false IDs.

1368
01:30:22,707 --> 01:30:24,175
Come on, ladies. I don't have all day.

1369
01:30:24,176 --> 01:30:25,710
- I got that.
- Mmm.

1370
01:30:25,711 --> 01:30:27,612
Let's see some ID, come on.

1371
01:30:27,613 --> 01:30:29,714
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1372
01:30:29,715 --> 01:30:32,817
Come on, let's get out of here.

1373
01:30:32,818 --> 01:30:36,319
Get out your IDs. Let's go!

1374
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:38,054
All right, girls. Pull them IDs.

1375
01:30:38,055 --> 01:30:39,255
Come on, open up those wallets.

1376
01:30:39,256 --> 01:30:40,390
Well, look who it is.

1377
01:30:40,391 --> 01:30:43,794
The elusive, untouchable Mr. Murphy.

1378
01:30:43,795 --> 01:30:45,729
Guess what? You're under arrest.

1379
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:48,765
Really? What are the charges?

1380
01:30:48,766 --> 01:30:50,635
You really want me to go
through all of them with you

1381
01:30:50,636 --> 01:30:51,368
right now in front of these nice people?

1382
01:30:51,369 --> 01:30:52,969
Yes, I would like that, yeah.

1383
01:30:52,970 --> 01:30:55,206
I don't have the fuckin'
time. Put up your arms.

1384
01:30:59,711 --> 01:31:02,813
You're hurting me, handsome.
Not so rough, mister.

1385
01:31:02,814 --> 01:31:05,816
Hey, Miller. Stop.

1386
01:31:05,817 --> 01:31:08,019
Jack, handcuff these two together.

1387
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:10,086
Really? What the fuck are you doing?

1388
01:31:10,087 --> 01:31:12,157
Trying to be a hero or something?

1389
01:31:15,694 --> 01:31:19,095
Mr. Murphy, some girls look good in Chanel.

1390
01:31:19,096 --> 01:31:22,299
But you look perfect in a
pair of nice shiny handcuffs.

1391
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:23,701
Shut the fuck up, will you?

1392
01:31:23,702 --> 01:31:24,835
Let's go! Get out of here.

1393
01:31:24,836 --> 01:31:25,969
All right, ladies. Let's go. Come on.

1394
01:31:25,970 --> 01:31:28,672
I said, not so rough.

1395
01:31:28,673 --> 01:31:31,841
Come on. Let's go. You
got IDs, you can leave.

1396
01:31:44,989 --> 01:31:47,125
You can go.

1397
01:31:54,032 --> 01:31:56,901
Hello, hello!

1398
01:31:56,902 --> 01:31:58,736
Our lovely Annie!

1399
01:31:58,737 --> 01:32:02,105
Dressed from the Raggedy Ann collection.

1400
01:32:02,106 --> 01:32:04,442
Work the runway, girl.

1401
01:32:04,443 --> 01:32:06,010
What a fuckin' circus.

1402
01:32:06,011 --> 01:32:09,479
And Paul in a fabulous suit by Givenchy.

1403
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:12,817
Next up, Queen Conga coming to the rescue

1404
01:32:12,818 --> 01:32:14,984
in her backpack day look.

1405
01:32:14,985 --> 01:32:17,321
Work the runway, mama.

1406
01:32:17,322 --> 01:32:22,126
Little Lee Boy up in his Jimmy
Dean <i>tres</i> boy realness,

1407
01:32:22,127 --> 01:32:24,327
and last, our Danny Boy,

1408
01:32:24,328 --> 01:32:30,033
straight off the runway from
the Ken Doll summer line.

1409
01:32:30,034 --> 01:32:34,004
Available only at Boy Toys "R" Us.

1410
01:32:38,777 --> 01:32:40,877
Looks like you're going down, Eddie.

1411
01:32:40,878 --> 01:32:43,314
I thought I told you to shut the fuck up.

1412
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:54,358
All right. Put 'em inside.

1413
01:32:54,359 --> 01:32:55,760
<i>Back up.</i>

1414
01:32:55,761 --> 01:32:58,862
<i>This is an unlawful assembly.
You will all be arrested.</i>

1415
01:32:58,863 --> 01:33:01,232
<i>Back up.</i>

1416
01:33:03,534 --> 01:33:05,502
<i>Go home.</i>

1417
01:33:05,503 --> 01:33:07,036
<i>If you stay here,
we're gonna arrest you.</i>

1418
01:33:07,037 --> 01:33:09,806
What's going on?

1419
01:33:09,807 --> 01:33:11,710
Another raid.

1420
01:33:17,983 --> 01:33:20,384
Who's the lucky lady?

1421
01:33:20,385 --> 01:33:22,119
<i>All, go home.</i>

1422
01:33:23,988 --> 01:33:26,055
Get your fuckin' hands off of me!

1423
01:33:26,056 --> 01:33:29,093
Fuck off! Fuck you!

1424
01:33:29,094 --> 01:33:31,127
No! Fuck off!

1425
01:33:31,128 --> 01:33:33,898
Fuck off! Don't touch me.

1426
01:33:33,899 --> 01:33:35,965
No! No!

1427
01:33:35,966 --> 01:33:38,068
Okay, okay.

1428
01:33:38,069 --> 01:33:39,804
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1429
01:33:39,805 --> 01:33:43,273
No! No! Get the fuck off!

1430
01:33:43,274 --> 01:33:47,010
Get your fuckin' hands off of me!

1431
01:33:47,011 --> 01:33:49,113
Hey, hey! Hey!

1432
01:33:50,314 --> 01:33:52,916
No, no! Fuck off!

1433
01:33:53,984 --> 01:33:56,286
Why are you all just standing there?

1434
01:33:56,287 --> 01:33:58,956
Fuckin' help me!

1435
01:34:03,161 --> 01:34:04,828
You follow me.

1436
01:34:04,829 --> 01:34:06,263
Get me out of here!

1437
01:34:06,264 --> 01:34:08,165
- Let's go.
- Get me out of here!

1438
01:34:08,166 --> 01:34:09,867
<i>All right, everybody. Back off.</i>

1439
01:34:09,868 --> 01:34:11,335
<i>Move away from the car.</i>

1440
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:14,604
- <i>You will be arrested.</i>
- Hey!

1441
01:34:14,605 --> 01:34:16,407
Are you taking me on a date, Mr. Murphy?

1442
01:34:16,408 --> 01:34:17,974
Taxi!

1443
01:34:17,975 --> 01:34:20,277
Hey, hey! Murphy's getting away!

1444
01:34:20,278 --> 01:34:22,914
<i>Get away from the car.</i>

1445
01:34:24,015 --> 01:34:26,317
Ray, Ray, Murphy's getting away!

1446
01:34:26,318 --> 01:34:27,885
Stop! Stop!

1447
01:34:27,886 --> 01:34:29,185
<i>Back off and get away</i>

1448
01:34:29,186 --> 01:34:30,453
- <i>from the car.</i>
- Did you see that?

1449
01:34:30,454 --> 01:34:31,855
Huh? Right there!

1450
01:34:31,856 --> 01:34:34,259
Why wouldn't you do anything?

1451
01:34:39,396 --> 01:34:40,864
What's going on out there?

1452
01:34:40,865 --> 01:34:43,233
Murphy got away.

1453
01:34:43,234 --> 01:34:44,102
We just took him out of here

1454
01:34:44,103 --> 01:34:45,435
and put him in a fuckin' paddy wagon.

1455
01:34:45,436 --> 01:34:47,170
- What happened?
- I guess you're right.

1456
01:34:47,171 --> 01:34:48,973
I guess he's got the 6th in their pocket.

1457
01:34:48,974 --> 01:34:50,441
You gotta take a look outside.

1458
01:34:50,442 --> 01:34:52,009
Every fag in New York is out there.

1459
01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:54,310
Jesus fuckin' Christ!

1460
01:34:54,311 --> 01:34:57,014
Why won't you do anything?

1461
01:34:57,015 --> 01:35:00,017
You fucks!

1462
01:35:00,018 --> 01:35:03,621
Look at these asses.
They're all the fuckin' same.

1463
01:35:03,622 --> 01:35:04,988
Where did all these people come from?

1464
01:35:04,989 --> 01:35:05,956
I told you.

1465
01:35:05,957 --> 01:35:07,390
This is gonna get out of hand really fast.

1466
01:35:07,391 --> 01:35:09,526
You mean the 6th just fuckin' left?

1467
01:35:09,527 --> 01:35:10,627
I've had it with this bullshit!

1468
01:35:10,628 --> 01:35:12,228
Oh, no, no, no!

1469
01:35:12,229 --> 01:35:13,330
No, no! Cong, you're gonna make it worse.

1470
01:35:13,331 --> 01:35:14,430
How can it get worse?

1471
01:35:14,431 --> 01:35:15,599
Between the mob

1472
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,035
and those fuckin', money grabbing pigs,

1473
01:35:18,036 --> 01:35:20,103
a society hating and oppressing us

1474
01:35:20,104 --> 01:35:23,540
for being gay, and you
still wanna be polite?

1475
01:35:23,541 --> 01:35:25,041
'Cause it's gonna take away your precious

1476
01:35:25,042 --> 01:35:27,176
fuckin' scholarship if you get arrested?

1477
01:35:27,177 --> 01:35:29,647
Come on!

1478
01:35:29,648 --> 01:35:32,916
Danny?

1479
01:35:32,917 --> 01:35:35,018
What are you doing?

1480
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:39,957
No. That's not the way, Danny.

1481
01:35:45,262 --> 01:35:48,299
No, Trevor. It's the only way!

1482
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:50,701
Gay power!

1483
01:35:50,702 --> 01:35:52,568
Come on!

1484
01:35:52,569 --> 01:35:54,537
Gay power!

1485
01:36:04,481 --> 01:36:06,917
Now, now. Hey, hey!

1486
01:36:11,323 --> 01:36:12,523
Everybody inside.

1487
01:36:12,524 --> 01:36:16,160
Inside! Back inside!

1488
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:25,035
Welcome to the fuckin' club, man.

1489
01:36:25,036 --> 01:36:27,238
Gay power!

1490
01:36:29,207 --> 01:36:30,573
Hey!

1491
01:36:30,574 --> 01:36:33,377
Put that jukebox against the doors.

1492
01:36:38,283 --> 01:36:39,450
They cut the phone lines. Jack...

1493
01:36:39,451 --> 01:36:41,318
- Yeah.
- Radio.

1494
01:36:41,319 --> 01:36:42,385
This is Seymour Pine.

1495
01:36:42,386 --> 01:36:44,054
We have an emergency situation.

1496
01:36:44,055 --> 01:36:47,590
Do you copy? We
are 10-41, 10-41.

1497
01:36:47,591 --> 01:36:49,593
Do you copy?

1498
01:36:49,594 --> 01:36:51,060
Shit!

1499
01:36:51,061 --> 01:36:52,763
Okay. We need to find a way out of here.

1500
01:36:52,764 --> 01:36:54,732
Maybe in the back. Find a phone.

1501
01:36:54,733 --> 01:36:57,600
Get us back up. Call TPF. Go!

1502
01:36:57,601 --> 01:36:59,303
All right. I need these kids over here.

1503
01:36:59,304 --> 01:37:00,603
Everybody in the back.

1504
01:37:04,074 --> 01:37:06,344
Over here.

1505
01:37:25,296 --> 01:37:27,298
Uh-oh.

1506
01:37:40,578 --> 01:37:42,981
Come on, girls, help me!

1507
01:37:48,619 --> 01:37:51,521
I got an idea. Come on, come on!

1508
01:37:53,725 --> 01:37:55,091
Hey!

1509
01:37:56,261 --> 01:37:58,795
Oh, yeah.

1510
01:37:58,796 --> 01:38:01,130
Sir, she got through the window.

1511
01:38:01,131 --> 01:38:02,232
TPF should be on the way.

1512
01:38:02,233 --> 01:38:03,800
Push!

1513
01:38:07,671 --> 01:38:11,442
Push that back! Keep that shut!

1514
01:38:18,382 --> 01:38:20,317
There will be no shooting
unless I shoot first.

1515
01:38:20,318 --> 01:38:22,251
You got it?

1516
01:38:22,252 --> 01:38:24,654
Oh, shit, there we go.

1517
01:38:27,524 --> 01:38:28,724
Let's go! Let's go!

1518
01:38:28,725 --> 01:38:30,461
Christ.

1519
01:38:30,462 --> 01:38:32,362
I hope they're not gonna burn
some old lady's house down.

1520
01:38:32,363 --> 01:38:34,130
That'll set us back years.

1521
01:38:34,131 --> 01:38:36,700
Would it, though? They're
not like us, Trevor.

1522
01:38:36,701 --> 01:38:39,503
These kids have nothing left to lose.

1523
01:38:42,506 --> 01:38:45,809
Let's organize a meeting for tomorrow.

1524
01:38:45,810 --> 01:38:48,379
Great idea.

1525
01:38:54,219 --> 01:38:56,620
Get away from the window! Jesus!

1526
01:38:56,621 --> 01:38:57,787
What the fuck?

1527
01:38:57,788 --> 01:39:00,724
It's like a campfire.

1528
01:39:00,725 --> 01:39:04,629
Look for a fire extinguisher! Fuck!

1529
01:39:05,829 --> 01:39:07,197
Keep the door shut!

1530
01:39:07,198 --> 01:39:08,898
There's people in here, you fucks!

1531
01:39:08,899 --> 01:39:10,634
This is not the way I was planning to die.

1532
01:39:10,635 --> 01:39:11,734
Can you imagine the headlines?

1533
01:39:11,735 --> 01:39:13,603
New York City cops killed by

1534
01:39:13,604 --> 01:39:15,238
a screaming mob of homosexuals.

1535
01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:17,207
Ha!

1536
01:39:34,292 --> 01:39:36,828
Oh, shit!

1537
01:39:40,698 --> 01:39:43,634
<i>All right, people. Back up!</i>

1538
01:39:43,635 --> 01:39:45,635
<i>Drop your bricks and your
stones and your bottles,</i>

1539
01:39:45,636 --> 01:39:47,237

1540

<i>If you stay here,
we're gonna arrest you.</i>

1542
01:40:05,422 --> 01:40:06,689
Come on, pick something up.

1543
01:40:06,690 --> 01:40:08,693
Hey.

1544
01:40:15,265 --> 01:40:18,268
Danny! Girls, girls! Line up!

1545
01:40:18,269 --> 01:40:19,702
Line up, girls, come on! Come on!

1546
01:40:19,703 --> 01:40:24,707
Come on, line up! One, two, three.

1547
01:40:24,708 --> 01:40:26,609

1565

Go, go, go. Let's get the fuck out of here!

1566
01:41:40,784 --> 01:41:42,352
We okay?

1567
01:41:42,353 --> 01:41:44,854
Yeah, we're okay.

1568
01:41:46,457 --> 01:41:48,459
Open that.

1569
01:41:52,663 --> 01:41:54,930
Where the fuck have you guys been?

1570
01:41:58,536 --> 01:42:01,305
Hey, you wait here.

1571
01:42:04,841 --> 01:42:08,377
Auntie, darling, I need your help.

1572
01:42:14,519 --> 01:42:16,886
Thank you very much.

1573
01:42:16,887 --> 01:42:20,323
You know what, Mr. Murphy? You're done.

1574
01:42:22,025 --> 01:42:24,327
You think?

1575
01:42:24,328 --> 01:42:26,630
One night of faggy temper
tantrums in the Village

1576
01:42:26,631 --> 01:42:28,497
changes anything?

1577
01:42:28,498 --> 01:42:32,635
I can't wait to watch you
figure it all out, honey.

1578
01:42:32,636 --> 01:42:34,938
Just don't call me honey, you freak.

1579
01:42:55,092 --> 01:42:57,295
Come on!

1580
01:43:01,733 --> 01:43:02,832
Whoo!

1581
01:43:05,703 --> 01:43:07,703
Fuck you!

1582
01:43:07,704 --> 01:43:09,906
Oh, shit!

01:43:09,907 --> 01:43:11,942
Ray!

Come on! Run, you fuckin' pigs!

1589
01:44:05,029 --> 01:44:07,096
Why don't you start by handing them out?

1590
01:44:07,097 --> 01:44:08,764
Okay.

1591
01:44:08,765 --> 01:44:10,768
Thanks.

1592
01:44:25,182 --> 01:44:27,717
Here you go.

1593
01:44:30,921 --> 01:44:34,724
"If you are..."

1594
01:44:34,725 --> 01:44:37,727
"Do you think homosexuals are revolting?"

1595
01:44:37,728 --> 01:44:39,462
You bet your sweet ass we are!

1596
01:44:39,463 --> 01:44:41,230
Guess who wrote this piece of shit?

1597
01:44:41,231 --> 01:44:42,999
- Oh.
- Mmm-hmm.

1598
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,800
Danny's man Trevor.

1599
01:44:44,801 --> 01:44:46,068
We out fighting,

1600
01:44:46,069 --> 01:44:48,205
and this motherfucker's home making flyers.

1601
01:44:48,206 --> 01:44:51,207
Oh, Mary, he's called for a meeting.

1602
01:44:51,208 --> 01:44:53,710
Ooh! Free sandwiches.

1603
01:44:53,711 --> 01:44:55,478
He's a brave man, your boyfriend.

1604
01:44:55,479 --> 01:44:58,081
Yeah, well, he's not my boyfriend.

1605
01:44:58,082 --> 01:44:59,483
God!

1606
01:44:59,484 --> 01:45:00,750
Ooh, the attitude.

1607
01:45:00,751 --> 01:45:04,220
Wait! I'm sorry. Look, I'm sorry!

1608
01:45:04,221 --> 01:45:07,090
No, you're right. He's all
talk, and talk is cheap.

1609
01:45:07,091 --> 01:45:08,925
You know, maybe you'll
figure that out one day.

1610
01:45:08,926 --> 01:45:10,926
Danny, don't go. Where you going?

1611
01:45:10,927 --> 01:45:13,496
I don't know, Ray!

1612
01:45:13,497 --> 01:45:17,267
Danny. I guess everything is different now.

1613
01:45:17,268 --> 01:45:19,769
Things are changing, like...

1614
01:45:19,770 --> 01:45:22,171
We could really get a place, you know.

1615
01:45:22,172 --> 01:45:25,608
I could get a real job. Screw this!

1616
01:45:25,609 --> 01:45:28,778
Ray, come on.

1617
01:45:28,779 --> 01:45:30,779
Don't you understand?

1618
01:45:30,780 --> 01:45:35,285
No. I mean, what am I
supposed to understand?

1619
01:45:35,286 --> 01:45:37,855
That I can't love you.

1620
01:45:39,289 --> 01:45:42,024
You and me...

1621
01:45:42,025 --> 01:45:44,794
I mean, different isn't even the word.

1622
01:45:44,795 --> 01:45:46,595
Danny, you don't think I know that?

1623
01:45:46,596 --> 01:45:48,764
I know.

1624
01:45:48,765 --> 01:45:54,304
I'm sorry, but I'm too mad
to love anyone right now.

1625
01:45:54,305 --> 01:45:55,671
This...

1626
01:45:55,672 --> 01:45:58,274
All this is so new to me,

1627
01:45:58,275 --> 01:46:00,544
but, you know, I like being mad!

1628
01:46:00,545 --> 01:46:02,077
I like not being the nice kid.

1629
01:46:02,078 --> 01:46:04,613
And last night felt so good.

1630
01:46:04,614 --> 01:46:05,715
You're always gonna be the nice kid,

1631
01:46:05,716 --> 01:46:07,917
you know that, right?

1632
01:46:07,918 --> 01:46:10,086
You can't help it.

1633
01:46:11,689 --> 01:46:13,891
Fuck you.

1634
01:46:17,694 --> 01:46:20,130
Thank you for showing me New York.

1635
01:46:27,805 --> 01:46:30,106
You'll always be my sister.

1636
01:46:32,676 --> 01:46:37,680
Yeah. My brick throwing sister.

1637
01:46:37,681 --> 01:46:39,849
I didn't know they made
farm boys from Kansas

1638
01:46:39,850 --> 01:46:42,152
that could throw like that.

1639
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:47,925
Yeah, right. In Kansas.

1640
01:46:51,295 --> 01:46:54,832
I'll see you around, Ray.

1641
01:47:37,707 --> 01:47:40,010
Hi, Sarah.

1642
01:47:40,011 --> 01:47:42,045
Is Joe home?

1643
01:47:42,046 --> 01:47:44,248
Danny...

1644
01:47:46,684 --> 01:47:49,686
Why don't you come
inside? He's in the garage.

1645
01:47:59,896 --> 01:48:02,398
Hi, Mrs. Altman.

1646
01:48:02,399 --> 01:48:04,335
Hello, Danny.

1647
01:48:09,707 --> 01:48:12,109
Joe's outside.

1648
01:48:44,708 --> 01:48:46,142
How's New York treating you?

1649
01:48:46,143 --> 01:48:49,011
It's good. It's weird.

1650
01:48:52,048 --> 01:48:54,385
I just finished my first year at Columbia.

1651
01:48:55,886 --> 01:48:58,155
That's what you always wanted.

1652
01:48:59,789 --> 01:49:01,824
Yeah, I guess.

1653
01:49:06,896 --> 01:49:08,832
Why'd you come here, Danny?

1654
01:49:16,841 --> 01:49:19,677
'Cause I just wanted you to know that

1655
01:49:22,113 --> 01:49:24,081
I really did love you.

1656
01:49:26,317 --> 01:49:28,351
Maybe I still do.

1657
01:49:29,854 --> 01:49:31,889
Danny.

1658
01:49:35,792 --> 01:49:37,860
I'm married.

1659
01:49:39,130 --> 01:49:40,462
Yeah.

1660
01:49:40,463 --> 01:49:43,300
I'm gonna have a baby.

1661
01:49:48,104 --> 01:49:53,009
I don't know what it was, what we had.

1662
01:49:54,043 --> 01:49:56,880
Maybe it was kind of like love.

1663
01:50:00,784 --> 01:50:03,287
Danny, whatever we...

1664
01:50:05,021 --> 01:50:06,923
I'm not like you.

1665
01:50:12,262 --> 01:50:16,332
If I'd known you'd hold
onto it like this, I...

1666
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:25,775
I just think you should leave.

1667
01:50:32,248 --> 01:50:34,517
Okay.

1668
01:50:34,518 --> 01:50:36,386
Okay.

1669
01:50:40,291 --> 01:50:43,226
I'm sorry, Danny.

1670
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:37,346
How's the book, Phebes?

1671
01:51:37,347 --> 01:51:39,416
- Danny!
- Hey.

1672
01:51:41,351 --> 01:51:42,484
I've missed you!

1673
01:51:42,485 --> 01:51:45,188
Wait!

1674
01:51:45,189 --> 01:51:47,991
If you didn't bring me
Andy Warhol's autograph,

1675
01:51:47,992 --> 01:51:48,992
you can just leave right now.

1676
01:51:48,993 --> 01:51:50,626
Oh, really?

1677
01:51:50,627 --> 01:51:52,996
What is it with you and Andy Warhol, huh?

1678
01:51:52,997 --> 01:51:54,096
What is it?

1679
01:51:57,368 --> 01:51:59,870
He's the opposite of this.

1680
01:52:01,171 --> 01:52:03,072
Hello, Danny.

1681
01:52:03,073 --> 01:52:06,410
I thought you and your
sister might be thirsty.

1682
01:52:09,212 --> 01:52:11,447
Thanks, Mom.

1683
01:52:15,319 --> 01:52:17,386
And thank you for sending in my papers.

1684
01:52:17,387 --> 01:52:20,223
I never would have got my
scholarship without them.

1685
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:23,026
Thank you for writing.

1686
01:52:23,027 --> 01:52:25,060
Are you happy?

1687
01:52:25,061 --> 01:52:27,529
More than I was.

1688
01:52:27,530 --> 01:52:31,367
Well. Okay.

1689
01:52:31,368 --> 01:52:35,873
I'll leave you to be with Phoebe.

1690
01:52:41,545 --> 01:52:42,711
I don't go to church with them anymore.

1691
01:52:42,712 --> 01:52:44,479
No?

1692
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:45,681
You got me out of that.

1693
01:52:45,682 --> 01:52:47,015
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1694
01:52:47,016 --> 01:52:49,051
How's that?

1695
01:52:49,052 --> 01:52:52,087
Well, I told them that their behavior

1696
01:52:52,088 --> 01:52:55,090
was not at all Christian towards you,

1697
01:52:55,091 --> 01:52:57,326
and that I was disappointed with them.

1698
01:53:00,029 --> 01:53:01,997
They're doing the best they can.

1699
01:53:01,998 --> 01:53:05,233
That's what they say about
anyone who's not good enough.

1700
01:53:05,234 --> 01:53:07,470
So...

1701
01:53:10,975 --> 01:53:12,241
So?

1702
01:53:12,242 --> 01:53:13,576
Do you have a boyfriend?

1703
01:53:13,577 --> 01:53:15,211
No.

1704
01:53:15,212 --> 01:53:17,580
I'm just asking.

1705
01:53:17,581 --> 01:53:22,318
But I do have friends. Good friends.

1706
01:53:22,319 --> 01:53:25,755
Wayne Mortal in my class is gay.

1707
01:53:25,756 --> 01:53:27,255
He told me.

1708
01:53:27,256 --> 01:53:32,428
And only me because he knows all about you.

1709
01:53:32,429 --> 01:53:35,098
Oh, yeah?

1710
01:53:35,099 --> 01:53:37,100
So I'm famous now.

1711
01:53:39,168 --> 01:53:42,170
Why'd you come back, Danny?

1712
01:53:42,171 --> 01:53:45,107
I had some unfinished business, I guess.

1713
01:53:46,310 --> 01:53:47,175
And to see you, stupid.

1714
01:53:48,511 --> 01:53:51,514
Why else would I come back? Huh?

1715
01:53:51,515 --> 01:53:55,184
Hey, so we're having a
parade in Manhattan next month

1716
01:53:55,185 --> 01:53:57,754
to commemorate the fighting.

1717
01:53:57,755 --> 01:54:01,590
We're gonna go all the way
uptown from the Village,

1718
01:54:01,591 --> 01:54:04,193
right up to Central Park,

1719
01:54:04,194 --> 01:54:08,331
and they're gonna call it
the Gay Liberation March.

1720
01:54:08,332 --> 01:54:12,635
Okay. I'm coming.

1721
01:54:12,636 --> 01:54:15,272
I'll take the train.

1722
01:54:17,608 --> 01:54:19,809
You know they're not
gonna let you go, right?

1723
01:54:19,810 --> 01:54:23,545
I know they won't.
They're trying not to make

1724
01:54:23,546 --> 01:54:27,617
the same mistakes with
me as they made with you.

1725
01:54:27,618 --> 01:54:30,086
Hey, hey.

1726
01:54:33,791 --> 01:54:36,325
I have to go, Phebes.

1727
01:54:36,326 --> 01:54:38,294
I can't miss my bus.

1728
01:54:38,295 --> 01:54:40,262
I love you.

1729
01:54:45,601 --> 01:54:49,538
Say hi to your friends for me. Okay?

1730
01:56:25,569 --> 01:56:28,304
If that isn't Danny Winters.

1731
01:56:28,305 --> 01:56:30,438
Well, hey, sister!

1732
01:56:31,807 --> 01:56:32,742
You know you can bring

1733
01:56:32,743 --> 01:56:34,376
your country ass downtown
more often, right?

1734
01:56:34,377 --> 01:56:35,745
Yeah, I know.

1735
01:56:35,746 --> 01:56:38,346
Look what I found!

1736
01:56:38,347 --> 01:56:41,317
Well, look who it is. How're you doing?

1737
01:56:41,318 --> 01:56:42,652
And how are you doing, huh?

1738
01:56:42,653 --> 01:56:44,353
- Same old, same old.
- Yeah?

1739
01:56:44,354 --> 01:56:45,654
Well, you got yourself some new clothes,

1740
01:56:45,655 --> 01:56:47,422
so it can't be all that bad.

1741
01:56:47,423 --> 01:56:50,593
Well, we had to dress up
'cause today's a special day.

1742
01:56:50,594 --> 01:56:51,626
How's school, Columbia?

1743
01:56:51,627 --> 01:56:52,827
It's great.

1744
01:56:52,828 --> 01:56:55,297
It's really great.

1745
01:56:55,298 --> 01:56:56,532
All right, people.

1746
01:56:56,533 --> 01:56:57,867
Let's get the show on the road.

1747
01:56:57,868 --> 01:57:00,202
Okay, bitches, you heard the man.

1748
01:57:00,203 --> 01:57:02,470
Let's face New York fuckin' City.

1749
01:57:06,376 --> 01:57:07,943
Out of the closet. In the street.

1750
01:57:07,944 --> 01:57:10,478
Out of the closet. In the street.

1751

I love you.
