Get back inside!

00:02:28,707 --> 00:02:32,108
Hey! Don't be scared.

5
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:35,380
Don't be scared. They ain't gonna bite you.

6
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,087
Come back, little lost sheep.

7
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:45,156
I could be your shepherd.

Aw, poor little thing.

15
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,790
Long way from home.

16
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:23,126
Starving and dragging a suitcase

17
00:03:23,127 --> 00:03:25,862
like a little baby chicken.

18
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:28,298
I'm not starving, sir.
I just had two hot dogs.

19
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:33,171
Oh, you want a third? Hmm?

20
00:03:34,638 --> 00:03:38,275
I'm kidding.

21
00:03:40,244 --> 00:03:42,146
You need somewhere to rest
your pretty little head

22
00:03:42,147 --> 00:03:43,814
and collect yourself?

23
00:03:43,815 --> 00:03:45,516
I happen to have a comfy little place

24
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,786
right around the corner.

25
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,821
No, I can wait. Thank you, sir.

26
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:56,594
Whoa, but I'm sure
they're worried to death.

27
00:03:56,595 --> 00:04:01,265
I bet they're by the telephone
right this second saying...

28
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:04,267
"When will he call?"

29
00:04:04,268 --> 00:04:05,803

Queen Tooey, leave him alone! Jesus!

34
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,288
You never stop, and you sound terrible.

35
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:27,557
Ray, darling, I sound just fine

36
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,259
for somebody who's had a
dick in his mouth all night.

37
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,927
Oops!

38
00:04:30,928 --> 00:04:32,396
Girl, from the looks of you,

39
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,230
that's the least of your worries.

40
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:35,865
Listen up, kid.

41
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:37,568
Don't follow this one
unless you want to end up

42
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,770
tied to a chair and
smothered in pancake batter

43
00:04:39,771 --> 00:04:40,937
or whatever that shit is.

44
00:04:42,274 --> 00:04:44,576
- Coca-Cola, please.
- Yes, sir.

45
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:49,379
Have a nice day, boys,

46
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,583
and remember, don't talk to strangers.

47
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,388
Do you know him?

48
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,924
Her? Yeah, I know her.

49
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,792
Why did you call him Queen Tooey?

50
00:05:01,793 --> 00:05:04,427
Because she goes into people's cabinets

51
00:05:04,428 --> 00:05:06,530
and steals their Tuninal.

52
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:10,934
Beans? Jeebs? Downers?

53
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,436
Right.

54
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:16,240
Oh, baby, you don't know nothing, do you?

55
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,444
I know I don't want to be tied to a chair

56
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:22,780
and covered in pancake batter.

57
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,982
I don't know.

58
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:31,487
It could be fun. Sticky but fun.

59
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:35,925
I already got you all figured out, okay?

60
00:05:35,926 --> 00:05:37,860
- Yeah? How's that?
- Hey, mama.

61
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:40,965
Let's see. Grew up in Kansas, right?

62
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,432
On like a pea farm or whatever.

63
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:45,869
Kissing goats and your
daddy was the preacher,

64
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,704
but secretly a little whoopsie, right,

65
00:05:47,705 --> 00:05:50,006
and Mama probably baked apple pies

66
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:52,343
and, uh, wrote your name in your underwear

67
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:54,377
with tiny thread.

68
00:05:54,378 --> 00:05:57,247
Okay, well, A, I'm from Brooktown, Indiana,

69
00:05:57,248 --> 00:06:00,016
and B, I did not grow
up making out with goats,

70
00:06:00,017 --> 00:06:01,785
and C, I'm here because I'm actually going

71
00:06:01,786 --> 00:06:03,686
- to Columbia in the fall.
- Oh, Columbia.

72
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:06,624
That's right, and hang on,
what the hell is a pea farm?

73
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,658
Look, small details, baby.

74
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,828
Once you realized what you really were,

75
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,831
you had to run away from home
to find your ass and quick.

76
00:06:17,702 --> 00:06:19,703
And what am I?

77
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:20,804
Well, you certainly didn't
come to Christopher Street

78
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:22,674
for the pizza.

79
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:31,014
I didn't run away from home. Kicked out.

80
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,816
Hey, look, run away, kicked out.

81
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:37,321
All that really matters
is now you're here, right?

82
00:06:37,322 --> 00:06:40,958
And you don't know what is what.

83
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,528
Welcome to New York and keep up.

84
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:50,600
Yo, everybody. This here's Danny.

85
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:52,903
He's on his way to Columbia in the fall.

86
00:06:52,904 --> 00:06:55,706
Danny, meet my little ladies of the night.

87
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,508
Queen Conga, straight off the boat

88
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:00,444
from some godforsaken island.

89
00:07:00,445 --> 00:07:03,379
And this Beatle groupie
over here, that's Quiet Paul.

90
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,814
And the chicken bone is Little Lee.

91
00:07:04,815 --> 00:07:06,383
What's up, man?

92
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,550
Hey.

93
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:10,320
Nobody gonna introduce me?

94
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:16,727
And this pathetic creature is Orphan Annie.

95
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:17,828
How long you been working the streets?

96
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:20,364
Annie, the boy just got
here. I mean, look at him.

97
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:22,867
Gee, he looks a lot like Justin.

98
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:26,569
I sure hope you don't end up like him.

99
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,871
What did you just say?

100
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:29,105
I didn't say nothing. I was just saying,

101
00:07:29,106 --> 00:07:30,273
hope you don't end up like him.

102
00:07:30,274 --> 00:07:32,675
Don't you fuckin' talk about
Justin, you little bitch!

103
00:07:32,676 --> 00:07:34,345
Girls!

104
00:07:34,346 --> 00:07:35,345
I'm the bitch? You're the bitch,

105
00:07:35,346 --> 00:07:38,014
picking up a know-nothing,
white trash twink.

106
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,720
Just don't be talking about Justin, okay?

107
00:07:43,721 --> 00:07:45,122
You gonna use it or not?

108
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:47,924
It's just too nice a day

109
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,960
to cut each other up, isn't it?

110
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:53,831
Blood, mess, tragically ruined outfits.

111
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:58,369
You fuckin' lucky bitch!

112
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,138
Yo, I'm starving. Is anybody else hungry?

113
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:02,939
<i>- Moi!
- You wanna come?</i>

114
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,109
Uh, no. I gotta, you
know, I got all this stuff.

115
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,009
Oh, Bob, will you take
his suitcase, please?

116
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,211
Yeah, of course.

117
00:08:08,212 --> 00:08:11,915
It's cool. We take care of
his dog, he takes care of us.

118
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,850
Sure?

119
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:15,485
I'm upstairs. Just bring it
up to the top of the steps.

120
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:17,653
Okay.

121
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:21,525
Oh, now that's gorgeous!

122
00:08:21,526 --> 00:08:24,961
What? That straw thing with the flowers?

123
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,997
Oh, I think it'll look nice on you, Annie.

124
00:08:27,998 --> 00:08:30,067
Whoa!

125
00:08:41,012 --> 00:08:43,814
Hey, what'd you do?

126
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,021
<i>♪ We are the baddest girls</i>

<i>♪ We show our pubic hair ♪</i>

130
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,468
Oh, shit! The law! The law!

131
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:09,906
Oh, I don't like that
coffee. I like Cavalier.

132
00:09:09,907 --> 00:09:12,543
What's wrong? No, no, no.

133
00:09:12,544 --> 00:09:14,210
Cavalier tastes like cat piss.

134
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:15,545
Chock Full o' Nuts?

135
00:09:15,546 --> 00:09:16,612
Why can't we get both?

136
00:09:16,613 --> 00:09:17,647
We can't afford both.

137
00:09:17,648 --> 00:09:18,848
Why not?

138
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,751
Because Mama's in the hospital.

139
00:09:21,752 --> 00:09:23,219
- My mom's in the hospital.
- Yes, she is.

140
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,588
And she's dying...

141
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:26,022
...of cancer.

142
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,024
Hey, I'm really sorry that your ma's sick,

143
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,025
but keep it down.

144
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,593
I got other customers.
Show a little respect.

145
00:09:29,594 --> 00:09:30,928
Stop that!

146
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:33,063
You know what? From now on, you get...

147
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:37,767
Yes, you are. You get your
hot beverages on your own.

148
00:09:37,768 --> 00:09:40,471
Anything else?

149
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:42,738
Barbra is a much bigger star.

150
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:44,708
Than Judy?

151
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,477
There's something so
broken about that junkie.

152
00:09:46,478 --> 00:09:48,111
I like someone who ain't
gonna collapse any minute.

153
00:09:48,112 --> 00:09:49,979
And that's Barbra.

154
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,716
Will someone please tell
this sticky, sugar-faced fool

155
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,650
that Judy's supposed to be tragic.

156
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:56,252
It's a part of her beauty.

157
00:09:56,253 --> 00:09:58,588
<i>In the Wizard of Oz,
man, she's just like us.</i>

158
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:01,625
A girl just lost in a world
that don't understand her.

159
00:10:01,626 --> 00:10:03,025
Midgets!

160
00:10:03,026 --> 00:10:05,896
That is so true, my
little wretched darling.

161
00:10:07,965 --> 00:10:09,766
I have so missed you!

162
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:12,502
Oh, she's back, the
Queen of Queens herself.

163
00:10:12,503 --> 00:10:14,136
Danny, meet Marsha Johnson.

164
00:10:14,137 --> 00:10:17,607
Marsha P. Johnson, if you please, darling.

165
00:10:17,608 --> 00:10:18,809
What's the "P" stand for?

166
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,011
Pay no mind.

167
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:24,280
Marsha is the only drag
queen that's nice to us.

168
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:27,184
Those other nasty
bitches don't know one day

169
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:29,620
Jesus is gonna punish them for their sins

170
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:31,921
and fuck them up good!

171
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:36,559
Okay? Oh, shit! My
first appointment awaits.

172
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,928
It's a certain fat priest
who has to pray to Mary

173
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,096
as he comes.

174
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,598
Wait, wait, wait... Is he really fat?

175
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,267
Shit, I know him. Everybody knows him!

176
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:48,170
Now, Lee, you stay away from my regulars.

177
00:10:48,171 --> 00:10:49,305
You don't want me to have to spank you.

178
00:10:49,306 --> 00:10:51,141
Maybe I do.

179
00:10:51,142 --> 00:10:52,242
Bye, girls.

180
00:10:52,243 --> 00:10:53,577
Bye, lover.

181
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:57,247
Hmm.

182
00:10:57,248 --> 00:10:59,750
Always on time.

183
00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:03,886
By the way, Judy is not
that good of an actress.

184
00:11:03,887 --> 00:11:06,857
All right, Danny Boy, I'm
gonna see you later, okay?

185
00:11:06,858 --> 00:11:09,660
Mama's got to work. Bye, girls.

186
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:11,160
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

187
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:13,263
Which is nothing, girl.

188
00:11:14,898 --> 00:11:17,067
Bitch has got to book. You coming?

189
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:21,070
Mmm-hmm. No rest for the weary.

190
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:24,908
See ya later, Columbia.

191
00:11:40,624 --> 00:11:43,660
<i>But all homosexuals are not passive.</i>

192
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:47,330
<i>Public restrooms can often be
a hangout for the homosexuals.</i>

193
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,799
<i>Bobby and his friends
hadn't noticed the man</i>

194
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,069
<i>who had been in the
restroom when they changed,</i>

195
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,170
<i>and as it was late, he suggested</i>

196
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,771
<i>they take the shortcut
under the pier,</i>

197
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:57,140
<i>but the others preferred to take</i>

198
00:11:57,141 --> 00:11:59,175
<i>the more traveled way home.</i>

199
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,144
Bobby, run away from the
faggot behind you, Bobby.

200
00:12:03,314 --> 00:12:05,281
<i>Bobby had made a wise decision.</i>

201
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:08,018
<i>It may have saved his life.</i>

202
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,655
Okay, kids.

203
00:12:12,656 --> 00:12:15,324
These are the things
we have to be aware of.

204
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:17,361
You know there are sick people out there,

205
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,396
and they are waiting.

206
00:12:19,397 --> 00:12:21,264
What is it that they do exactly?

207
00:12:21,265 --> 00:12:23,333
Well, they're kind of like Count Dracula,

208
00:12:23,334 --> 00:12:25,234
but instead of sucking your blood,

209
00:12:25,235 --> 00:12:27,703
eh, they're sucking something else.

210
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:29,006
Nah, Trev, you got it all wrong.

211
00:12:29,007 --> 00:12:30,707
A guy wears a dress,

212
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,041
the other guy takes that dress off,

213
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,876
and then they do it up the butt.

214
00:12:33,877 --> 00:12:35,712
How do you know so much about it, Mattie?

215
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,080
Oh, Joe.

216
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:40,751
I still don't get it. Joe!

217
00:12:46,257 --> 00:12:48,224
- Let's go!
- Sixty-eight!

218
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,227
Why you babies stopping back there?

219
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,762
Let's add 20 pushups.

220
00:12:52,763 --> 00:12:54,765
On my whistle, Joe's gonna count 'em out.

221
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,669
One, two, three...

222
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,237
That's right, Joe. You set the pace here.

223
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,406
Keep going. Attaboy, Joe.

224
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,041
Come on, Danny. You gonna join us sometime

225
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:06,776
before 1970 rolls around?

226
00:13:06,777 --> 00:13:08,078
Let's go.

227
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,448
Three, two. Come on, Danny, get up!

228
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:16,453
You never shower.

229
00:13:16,454 --> 00:13:18,121
I never sweat. Some people don't sweat.

230
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:20,190
I'm one of 'em.

231
00:13:24,362 --> 00:13:26,731
You around this weekend?

232
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:47,383
I can't be any easier on
you, Danny. I just can't.

233
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,722
You understand that, right?

234
00:13:51,723 --> 00:13:54,058
Yes, Dad.

235
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:38,869
Hey, hey, hey!

236
00:14:46,243 --> 00:14:48,044
<i>For only 100 bucks?</i>

237
00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:49,279
<i>Talk about taking advantage
of a little kid...</i>

238
00:14:50,781 --> 00:14:52,381
<i>...who's a member
of a minority group.</i>

239
00:14:53,785 --> 00:14:56,819
I got it.

240
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:00,324
Coach Winters.

241
00:15:02,794 --> 00:15:05,328
Who is this?

242
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:08,299
Dad, it's me. Can we talk, please?

243
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,535
I'm just calling 'cause I...
I hope you're still gonna

244
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,905
send in the papers for
my scholarship, all right?

245
00:15:14,906 --> 00:15:16,238
<i>You know that...</i>

246
00:15:20,011 --> 00:15:22,146
Dad?

247
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:30,754
Was that Danny?

248
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:34,758
Dad?

249
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,405
I'm sorry, sir, but we're closed.

250
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,875
Can I just get a cup of coffee, please?

251
00:15:51,876 --> 00:15:53,911
Sure.

252
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,350
Thanks.

253
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:04,887
Um, I don't suppose you're
hiring at the moment,

254
00:16:04,888 --> 00:16:06,389
are you, sir?

255
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,592
Got any experience as a short order cook?

256
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,926
- No.
- Hi, everybody.

257
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,363
They all queers now.

258
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:15,631
It used to be poets and mobsters.

259
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:18,267
Now they just fags.

260
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,236
I'm real sorry, sir. Thank you.

261
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,416
Yeah, I'm actually late,
so I'm gonna head out now.

262
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:36,419
Good to see you.

263
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,356
- Be careful!
- As always!

264
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:44,126
Why, hello again, Mr. Danny.

265
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:46,463
Out for a stroll, are we?

266
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,631
No, no, I'm looking for Ray.

267
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,300
The new boys hang out a little further...

268
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,935
Yeah, how are you?

269
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:55,438
Hey, what's up? Yo, how you doing?

270
00:17:09,085 --> 00:17:12,088
Hey, Ray? Ray!

271
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,139
Oh, shit.

272
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,314
Get out of my way!

273
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:40,083
Get out of here, God damn it!

274
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:41,985
You fuckin' faggots, move your ass.

275
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:43,553
Get out of here.

276
00:17:43,554 --> 00:17:45,421
Get the fuck out of here!

277
00:17:45,422 --> 00:17:47,157
You're disturbing my friends!

278
00:17:47,158 --> 00:17:49,191
Get the fuck away from here.

279
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:51,895
You fucking cocksuckers!

280
00:17:54,297 --> 00:17:56,498
What are you looking at, faggot?

281
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:58,168
Nothing.

282
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,245
Hey, where you going, cum stain?

283
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:16,419
He's pretty, yeah.

284
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,055
Oh, you're a pretty one, huh?

285
00:18:20,056 --> 00:18:21,757
You wanna suck my dick?

286
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:23,459
I think he wants to suck your dick.

287
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,593
You wanna suck my dick?

288
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:26,028
No.

289
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:27,596
- Come on.
- Suck his dick!

290
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:30,366
Suck his fuckin' dick!
Get in there right now.

291
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:32,134
Hey, hey!

292
00:18:32,135 --> 00:18:33,335
Oh, shit! No! No!

293
00:18:33,336 --> 00:18:35,071
She's got a temper, huh?

294
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,573
No!

295
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,741
Still got a temper, faggot? Huh?

296
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,417
No, no!

297
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:50,285
Stop. Stop!

298
00:18:57,394 --> 00:18:58,361
You know what, I don't even want him

299
00:18:58,362 --> 00:19:00,563
to suck my dick no more!

300
00:19:00,564 --> 00:19:02,164
Look at his mouth. It's
all full of blood and shit.

301
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:04,633
That's disgusting.

302
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,278
Heavenly Father, we
thank you for this food.

303
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,580
For these and all your blessings,

304
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:18,782
God's holy name be blessed and praised

305
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,650
through Jesus Christ, our Lord, amen.

306
00:19:20,651 --> 00:19:22,518
Amen.

307
00:19:25,422 --> 00:19:28,157
They showed a film in school today.

308
00:19:29,192 --> 00:19:33,162
We younger kids were not allowed to see it.

309
00:19:34,297 --> 00:19:36,232
I wonder why.

310
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,202
Mr. Truman Capote,

311
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:43,573
<i>who wrote In Cold
Blood, is also a homosexual.</i>

312
00:19:43,574 --> 00:19:45,542
Maybe that's why

313
00:19:45,543 --> 00:19:47,110
I wasn't allowed to see that movie either.

314
00:19:47,111 --> 00:19:50,314
Phoebe, we're having dinner, thank you.

315
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:54,750
<i>Well, I also really want
to see Dr. Doolittle.</i>

316
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,786
- He talks to animals.
- Hmm.

317
00:19:57,787 --> 00:20:00,722
Maybe you should see that movie, Dad.

318
00:20:00,723 --> 00:20:02,658
Maybe he could get you to talk.

319
00:20:05,696 --> 00:20:07,564
You finding this amusing, Danny?

320
00:20:11,134 --> 00:20:12,302
No, sir.

321
00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:14,338
"No, sir."

322
00:20:18,142 --> 00:20:20,510
Can I borrow your car tonight, Mom?

323
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:26,683
Joe wants me to hang out with him.

324
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,854
Don't be home too late.

325
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,123
I won't.

326
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:39,629
Brent, do you really think
it was such a good idea?

327
00:20:41,398 --> 00:20:42,498
Sheriff Goodwin was great, honey.

328
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:43,900
He laid it all out.

329
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:45,735
I don't even think it's true,

330
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:48,270
and I don't know why you do.

331
00:20:48,271 --> 00:20:49,404
There are signs,

332
00:20:49,405 --> 00:20:50,406
and if you don't wanna see them,

333
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:52,476
that's fine, but I do.

334
00:21:05,421 --> 00:21:07,556
<i>This is WTTV FM,</i>

335
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,825
<i>rocking Brooktown all night long.</i>

336
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:16,700
They're not gonna go, Joe,
I'm telling you right now.

337
00:21:18,201 --> 00:21:19,602
Hey, Danny.

338
00:21:19,603 --> 00:21:21,904
We're taking bets on who's
goin' to the World Series.

339
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,439
Joe picks the Mets.

340
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,641
Yeah, I guess.

341
00:21:25,642 --> 00:21:27,709
See? He knows.

342
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,879
- Danny knows.
- Hi, Danny.

343
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,247
- Hey.
- Sarah got into Syracuse.

344
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:33,850
- Oh, yeah?
- Did you hear from Columbia?

345
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:35,719
Yeah.

346
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,690
Hey, about time you showed up.

347
00:21:42,392 --> 00:21:44,627
Bye, guys.

348
00:21:45,863 --> 00:21:47,863
I don't know. Danny's just weird.

349
00:21:50,734 --> 00:21:52,701
He never wants to stick around.

350
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:53,803
Come on, babe. Let's go, too.

351
00:21:53,804 --> 00:21:55,537
I gotta get the car back.

352
00:21:55,538 --> 00:21:58,441
Okay. Bye, guys.

353
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,767
Hey.

354
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:33,776
God, that fuckin' film!

355
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:39,515
Yep. They were creepy-looking men.

356
00:22:39,516 --> 00:22:41,551
Half the fuckin' faculty
look like those guys.

357
00:22:41,552 --> 00:22:44,853
Joe, don't be stupid. He meant it for us...

358
00:22:44,854 --> 00:22:47,556
At least he meant it for me.

359
00:22:47,557 --> 00:22:50,459
He even dragged poor Sheriff Goodwin along,

360
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,662
telling me he was on to us.

361
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,466
Hey.

362
00:23:00,571 --> 00:23:02,872
I can't wait to get out of this place.

363
00:23:02,873 --> 00:23:05,507
Joe, wait. Wait, wait! Wait, wait!

364
00:23:05,508 --> 00:23:07,943
What?

365
00:23:07,944 --> 00:23:09,845
Do you think we're sick?

366
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,347
It's just nothing. It's not anything.

367
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:14,550
Cool it!

368
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:17,820
We're just fooling around.
Sarah won't do anything.

369
00:23:17,821 --> 00:23:19,988
You don't even have a girlfriend.

370
00:23:19,989 --> 00:23:21,990
It's more than that. I just...

371
00:23:23,994 --> 00:23:26,330
I really like you, Joe.

372
00:23:29,065 --> 00:23:32,802
Don't fucking say that.
This is just for now.

373
00:23:32,803 --> 00:23:35,671
We're not faggots.

374
00:23:35,672 --> 00:23:38,808
Just relax, Danny. Relax.

375
00:24:06,536 --> 00:24:07,870
Looks like our Johnny Boy

376
00:24:07,871 --> 00:24:09,706
didn't take his girl right home, huh?

377
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:12,741
A little stopover first.

378
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,278
A little bit of hanky-panky, man.

379
00:24:18,414 --> 00:24:21,050
Excuse me.

380
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:22,418
Matt, where you going?

381
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,619
Shh!

382
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,755
Where are you going?

383
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:28,792
Going to surprise them.

384
00:24:43,907 --> 00:24:45,941
Oh, no!

385
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,426
What was that?

386
00:25:06,662 --> 00:25:08,765
What was that?

387
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:30,353
Don't be a stranger!

388
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,028
Ray? Ray!

389
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:41,497
Hey, Columbia.

390
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,597
Wait!

391
00:25:42,598 --> 00:25:45,000
Wow, nice digs.

392
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,170
Where you been?

393
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,704
I was away for a while.

394
00:25:48,705 --> 00:25:50,105
Yeah?

395
00:25:50,106 --> 00:25:52,074
The fuck happen to you?

396
00:25:52,075 --> 00:25:56,045
Nothing. I've been lookin' for you.

397
00:25:56,046 --> 00:25:57,546
Nothing?

398
00:25:57,547 --> 00:25:59,215
Nothing will do that, all right.

399
00:25:59,216 --> 00:26:01,516
Come on.

400
00:26:01,517 --> 00:26:02,752
Where we going?

401
00:26:02,753 --> 00:26:04,821
What, you got a better option?

402
00:26:04,822 --> 00:26:06,823
No.

403
00:26:24,173 --> 00:26:26,410
Hurry up!

404
00:26:29,145 --> 00:26:31,882
What took you so long?

405
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,536
What are you waiting for?

406
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,879
You're handsome!

407
00:27:48,926 --> 00:27:51,960
It's okay.

408
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,663
Listen, this is only temporary

409
00:27:54,664 --> 00:27:58,301
because we could find a real place

410
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,971
'cause I just made some real money.

411
00:28:02,672 --> 00:28:05,173
I got a cousin.

412
00:28:05,174 --> 00:28:08,643
He went to pharmacy school in California.

413
00:28:08,644 --> 00:28:14,749
You know, where Judy and Liza and Lorna,

414
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:18,653
they live there with a lot of palm trees.

415
00:28:18,654 --> 00:28:21,023
You could go to pharmacy school, too.

416
00:28:21,024 --> 00:28:23,926
I can't go because I'm not smart like that,

417
00:28:23,927 --> 00:28:27,228
but I can make a nice home.

418
00:28:27,229 --> 00:28:31,866
<i>I could clean. I could
cook arroz con pollo.</i>

419
00:28:31,867 --> 00:28:35,705
I could drive to the
supermarket in our Chevrolet,

420
00:28:35,706 --> 00:28:39,175
and I could buy groceries.

421
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:42,644
It'll be so nice.

422
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:45,814
Would you like that?

423
00:28:45,815 --> 00:28:47,983
Danny?

424
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,296
Good night.

425
00:29:54,817 --> 00:30:00,623
Daniel, the Coach wants
to see you right away.

426
00:30:25,315 --> 00:30:27,383
Joe...

427
00:31:01,117 --> 00:31:03,686
I know everything.

428
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:08,324
Don't bother denying it. Joe told me,

429
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,759
and I'd seen it coming, too.

430
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,296
The sickness...

431
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:19,768
You, seducing him,

432
00:31:20,804 --> 00:31:23,006
taking the lead.

433
00:31:24,207 --> 00:31:26,275
Oh, it's such a great way to attack me

434
00:31:26,276 --> 00:31:28,510
and ruin my quarterback.

435
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,446
You got him drunk so
he wouldn't even realize

436
00:31:30,447 --> 00:31:33,049
what was going on.

437
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:37,852
I wanna do the right thing, Danny.

438
00:31:37,853 --> 00:31:40,322
You need help, son,

439
00:31:40,323 --> 00:31:43,525
and we're gonna get you that help.

440
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:47,029
I need you to look me in the eye, Danny,

441
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:50,365
and tell me you need help.

442
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:53,302
This is a one-time thing, Danny.

443
00:31:56,472 --> 00:31:58,507
Look at me.

444
00:32:03,814 --> 00:32:06,916
Say it!

445
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:10,419
This is a one-time thing, Danny. Say it!

446
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,022
Say it!

447
00:33:14,217 --> 00:33:16,553
Your father called.

448
00:33:49,451 --> 00:33:52,086
Please don't go, Danny!

449
00:33:52,087 --> 00:33:54,523
Hey, hey, hey!

450
00:33:54,524 --> 00:33:58,326
Please don't leave, Danny, please. Please.

451
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:01,362
Phoebe, look, I have
to, all right? I have to.

452
00:34:01,363 --> 00:34:03,198
They said all these mean things at school.

453
00:34:03,199 --> 00:34:05,199
I just had to get out of there.

454
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,702
I know, I know. You're
smarter than them, right?

455
00:34:07,703 --> 00:34:08,738
They're gonna keep saying those things,

456
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:10,505
but you're not going to
believe them, are you?

457
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,574
No.

458
00:34:12,575 --> 00:34:14,008
Look, I'm going to write you, okay?

459
00:34:14,009 --> 00:34:15,677
I'm going to write you every single day.

460
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,079
I promise you, every single day.

461
00:34:21,283 --> 00:34:23,619
Where do you want to go?

462
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,220
I'm going to go to New York maybe.

463
00:34:25,221 --> 00:34:29,959
I'll come with you. I...
I can come with you. Please.

464
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,693
Oh, Phebes, you know you can't.

465
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,563
Cricket, you know you can't.

466
00:34:34,564 --> 00:34:35,731
Come on.

467
00:35:03,692 --> 00:35:05,560
Joe.

468
00:35:07,096 --> 00:35:09,063
What do you want?

469
00:35:09,064 --> 00:35:12,701
Joe, it's me.

470
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:19,273
Why did you lie about us?

471
00:35:19,274 --> 00:35:22,110
You should go, Danny.

472
00:35:23,446 --> 00:35:25,949
Please, just go!

473
00:35:42,232 --> 00:35:46,436
Joe, who was that?

474
00:36:04,053 --> 00:36:06,655
Asshole, we're trying
to get our beauty sleep.

475
00:36:06,656 --> 00:36:09,057
Open up!

476
00:36:09,058 --> 00:36:12,995
Someone answer the goddamn
fuckin' door, please!

477
00:36:14,196 --> 00:36:15,296
Look, mister, you're
going to have to give us

478
00:36:15,297 --> 00:36:16,697
a few more hours.

479
00:36:16,698 --> 00:36:18,633
We're working girls in here, you know that.

480
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,702
No. You gotta get out.
I know what's going on.

481
00:36:20,703 --> 00:36:22,271
There's at least a dozen
of you guys in there.

482
00:36:22,272 --> 00:36:23,805
Oh, come on, mister.

483
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:26,608
We're gonna be really nice
to you, aren't we, girls?

484
00:36:26,609 --> 00:36:28,209
I could be nice, but I don't want to.

485
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,811
We'll pay for tomorrow.

486
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,313
If you guys are not out
of here in half an hour,

487
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,616
I'll call the police.

488
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,351
You heard the bitch.

489
00:36:36,352 --> 00:36:40,655
Fuck! It's a brand new
day, bitches. Wake up.

490
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,618
Mmm. Mmm.

491
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,720
What?

492
00:37:12,721 --> 00:37:14,389
No, nothing.

493
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:18,226
Oh? College boy has a problem?

494
00:37:18,227 --> 00:37:20,695
This weekend, I'll go
dancing at the Stonewall,

495
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,898
and I wanna look just
right when I'm dancing.

496
00:37:22,899 --> 00:37:24,365
You look right now, mama.

497
00:37:24,366 --> 00:37:25,467
I want to shine, bitches.

498
00:37:26,736 --> 00:37:28,570
- You're shining, mama.
- Mmm.

499
00:37:28,571 --> 00:37:31,473
So you just take whatever you want?

500
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:37,679
Yeah. That's right, farm boy.

501
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,184
I take whatever I want
and can 'cause if I didn't,

502
00:37:43,185 --> 00:37:47,255
I'd have nothing at all.

503
00:37:47,256 --> 00:37:48,523
That might be a lesson you wanna learn

504
00:37:48,524 --> 00:37:50,660
before you go to college, okay?

505
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:55,296
'Cause the truth is,
you ain't going nowhere

506
00:37:55,297 --> 00:37:58,267
other than the street,
just like the rest of us.

507
00:37:58,268 --> 00:38:00,401
Everyone in this room thinks

508
00:38:00,402 --> 00:38:03,738
they're on their way to somewhere better,

509
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,874
but I have not seen one dream come true

510
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:09,410
on Christopher Street, baby.

511
00:38:09,411 --> 00:38:12,114
Not one.

512
00:38:13,315 --> 00:38:17,619
And my dream has always been
to have this shade of red,

513
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,921
and bitches, I got it.

514
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:44,780
Nah. Look, there's nothing we can do.

515
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:46,981
We don't have the documents
from your folks, Mr. Winters.

516
00:38:46,982 --> 00:38:49,351
But I'm still admitted, right? So...

517
00:38:49,352 --> 00:38:51,920
Yeah, I can hold your place
until June, July maybe,

518
00:38:51,921 --> 00:38:52,988
but after that...

519
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:56,325
I mean, there's kids on
the waiting list, right?

520
00:38:58,361 --> 00:39:02,231
May I ask why you're incomplete?

521
00:39:02,232 --> 00:39:05,334
I had to leave early for personal reasons.

522
00:39:05,335 --> 00:39:09,972
Look, when a kid comes into
my office in this situation,

523
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:13,307
I say, do everything you can to graduate.

524
00:39:13,308 --> 00:39:15,510
The City of New York
will let you do it here

525
00:39:15,511 --> 00:39:17,778
at night for free, right
here at the college.

526
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:19,347
Night school.

527
00:39:19,348 --> 00:39:21,516
And then you can come here in the fall,

528
00:39:21,517 --> 00:39:25,587
scholarship intact and
even have somewhere to live.

529
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:28,724
- Frankie!
- Look.

530
00:39:28,725 --> 00:39:29,825
I can't have you and half a dozen of

531
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:30,793
underage hustlers here.

532
00:39:30,794 --> 00:39:33,028
Half a dozen? That seems
like the least amount

533
00:39:33,029 --> 00:39:35,896
of hustlers you need, Frankie, baby.

534
00:39:35,897 --> 00:39:37,532
Now I know some of your clientele

535
00:39:37,533 --> 00:39:39,334
might come in for your
watered-down drinks,

536
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:43,639
but the only cock and tail
they stay for, honey, is ours.

537
00:39:46,975 --> 00:39:50,311
Tata!

538
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,981
Ladies and gentlemen,

539
00:39:53,982 --> 00:39:57,818
please address me as Queen Conga.

540
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:02,923
Do you like it?

541
00:40:02,924 --> 00:40:05,494
Oh, yeah. No, it's beautiful,

542
00:40:05,495 --> 00:40:08,729
except I think I've seen that
fabric before, Queen Conga...

543
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,532
- Oh, really? Mmm.
- ...but where? Mmm?

544
00:40:12,669 --> 00:40:15,537
Oh, country mouse is learning
how to talk like a city girl.

545
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,972
- Sure is.
- Ah!

546
00:40:17,973 --> 00:40:21,742
It's impolite to keep Her Majesty waiting.

547
00:40:21,743 --> 00:40:24,747
Come on, Frankie, be a dear.

548
00:40:26,783 --> 00:40:28,349
Ooh!

549
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,485
Follow me, boys!

550
00:40:30,486 --> 00:40:33,421
What you waiting for? It's fun.

551
00:40:33,422 --> 00:40:37,459
Hello, darling. Two tickets, please.

552
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,795
Look, you gotta sign in.
Don't use your real name.

553
00:40:39,796 --> 00:40:41,662
This shithole is run by the mob.

554
00:40:41,663 --> 00:40:43,699
They don't got a liquor license.

555
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,367
What do you mean, this
place is run by the mob?

556
00:40:45,368 --> 00:40:46,901
Oh, listen, bitch. Don't
you know that selling alcohol

557
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:49,570
to us sexual deviants is illegal?

558
00:40:49,571 --> 00:40:52,541
That's why these greasy
fucktards and bastards

559
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:55,711
own almost all the gay
bars in the Village. Mmm.

560
00:40:55,712 --> 00:40:58,512
Nobody likes us, baby.
Plus, they got the drugs,

561
00:40:58,513 --> 00:40:59,914
the pills and the booze.

562
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,416
Smart, smart businessmen.

563
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,684
Yeah, very smart, indeed.

564
00:41:02,685 --> 00:41:03,985
I don't wanna know how
much y'all spend a week

565
00:41:03,986 --> 00:41:06,488
paying off the cops, too.

566
00:41:06,489 --> 00:41:08,889
Thanks, Frankie.

567
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,992
<i>Voila!</i>

568
00:41:21,571 --> 00:41:24,072
Here. She'll make you feel good.

569
00:41:24,073 --> 00:41:25,539
This way, Mr. Wayne.

570
00:41:53,902 --> 00:41:56,972
Looking for me, Ray?

571
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,074
You see, now this is what
we need more of around here.

572
00:41:59,075 --> 00:42:02,644
All-American kids,
clean-cut kids,

573
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,813
not gutter trash like you, Ramona.

574
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,648
What's your name, kid?

575
00:42:07,649 --> 00:42:11,086
- I'm Daniel.
- Daniel?

576
00:42:11,087 --> 00:42:12,586
Such a nice name.

577
00:42:12,587 --> 00:42:14,588
Leave him alone, Ed.

578
00:42:14,589 --> 00:42:17,824
Just a second.

579
00:42:28,603 --> 00:42:30,772
Danny.

580
00:42:36,446 --> 00:42:40,514
Look, whatever you do,
just avoid that guy, okay?

581
00:42:40,515 --> 00:42:41,583
He used to be a wrestler.

582
00:42:41,584 --> 00:42:44,820
Now he's into pimping
out little boys like you.

583
00:42:44,821 --> 00:42:46,720
- Hey, you listening to me?
- Yeah, I heard you.

584
00:42:46,721 --> 00:42:50,025
They don't call him
The Skull for no reason!

585
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,693
Skull. Right, right, right.

586
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,962
Come on.

587
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,834
Hector, two sunshines.

588
00:42:58,835 --> 00:43:01,670
Hello, Danny, dear.

589
00:43:01,671 --> 00:43:03,537
What do you think of this
nasty little gay place?

590
00:43:03,538 --> 00:43:05,874
Cute, isn't it?

591
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,809
- Yeah.
- You're lucky.

592
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:11,213
People in New York like a
straight-looking boy like you.

593
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:13,215
You can do very well down here.

594
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:15,817
I need to go to the ladies' room.

595
00:43:17,118 --> 00:43:19,054
No.

596
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:21,188
Don't drink the nasty booze here.

597
00:43:21,189 --> 00:43:23,892
They don't have running water.
We'll be getting hepatitis.

598
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:24,892
They don't have running water?

599
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,561
Take the beer. It's in a bottle.

600
00:43:27,562 --> 00:43:29,998
Oh.

601
00:43:36,205 --> 00:43:38,005
You got a quarter, mama?

602
00:43:38,006 --> 00:43:40,141
Only for you, honey.

603
00:43:40,142 --> 00:43:42,511
Light me up!

604
00:44:08,036 --> 00:44:10,771
Do you like my shoes, darling?

605
00:44:10,772 --> 00:44:13,275
They were on sale at Lord & Taylor.

606
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:14,608
Take this.

607
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:17,612
Freshly cleaned and only smells of me.

608
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,215
You wanna change?

609
00:44:20,216 --> 00:44:23,050
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

610
00:44:23,051 --> 00:44:25,220
Forget it!

611
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:30,926
Come on, Danny, dance with me.

612
00:44:39,268 --> 00:44:41,936
- Dance with me!
- Hey, I don't wanna dance.

613
00:44:41,937 --> 00:44:44,972
What? Are you ashamed to dance with me?

614
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:49,610
No. I just don't feel like dancing. Okay?

615
00:44:49,611 --> 00:44:53,815
Okay. Maybe later.

616
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:11,825
What the fuck?

617
00:46:35,917 --> 00:46:37,718
Hey.

618
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:39,054
Hi.

619
00:46:39,055 --> 00:46:41,188
I'm Trevor.

620
00:46:41,189 --> 00:46:43,391
I'm Danny.

621
00:46:43,392 --> 00:46:47,763
You know, you look like
you need a little rescuing.

622
00:46:48,797 --> 00:46:51,065
Maybe just a little.

623
00:46:52,301 --> 00:46:55,936
So, um, this particular shithole

624
00:46:55,937 --> 00:46:59,773
does not look like Danny's natural habitat.

625
00:46:59,774 --> 00:47:03,678
Now that is a very interesting picture.

626
00:47:08,149 --> 00:47:11,251
If I were to ask you to dance with me,

627
00:47:11,252 --> 00:47:14,222
despite this being a particular shithole,

628
00:47:14,223 --> 00:47:16,057
what would you say?

629
00:47:16,058 --> 00:47:20,295
Um, no, really. I'm a terrible dancer.

630
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:22,963
I mean, my little sister,
she's always telling me

631
00:47:22,964 --> 00:47:27,235
I dance like Frankenstein's monster.

632
00:47:27,236 --> 00:47:29,270
Come on, Danny.

633
00:47:35,076 --> 00:47:37,912
Okay.

634
00:47:37,913 --> 00:47:40,215
All right.

635
00:47:58,868 --> 00:48:01,436
What's wrong? Why you so sad?

636
00:48:01,437 --> 00:48:03,104
Who's that guy?

637
00:48:03,105 --> 00:48:04,805
His name is Trevor.

638
00:48:04,806 --> 00:48:08,142
He's very political.

639
00:48:08,143 --> 00:48:10,211
And he clearly has money.

640
00:48:10,212 --> 00:48:11,479
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

641
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,213
Maybe your Danny Boy has found his way

642
00:48:13,214 --> 00:48:16,017
without your help after all.

643
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,418
Mmm.

644
00:48:18,419 --> 00:48:20,220
So if you hate this place so much,

645
00:48:20,221 --> 00:48:22,023
what are you doing here?

646
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,325
I'm writing an article about the Stonewall.

647
00:48:24,326 --> 00:48:25,894
You're a writer?

648
00:48:25,895 --> 00:48:29,363
No, I'm a member of the Mattachine Society.

649
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:31,566
What's that?

650
00:48:31,567 --> 00:48:35,269
We're an organization
that fights for gay rights.

651
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:38,206
Take Stonewall, for example.

652
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:40,208
You know it's run by crooks

653
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:44,144
who rip off and poison gay men.

654
00:48:44,145 --> 00:48:47,149
We deserve the right to own our own clubs.

655
00:48:53,087 --> 00:48:55,189
Just relax.

656
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,240
- All right, it's a raid!
- Fuck!

657
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:14,976
Let's go! Up against the wall.

658
00:49:14,977 --> 00:49:17,211
- Come on. Get back.
- All right, ladies.

659
00:49:17,212 --> 00:49:20,048
You know the drill, huh? IDs, please.

660
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,383
Get in a line up against the walls.

661
00:49:23,384 --> 00:49:25,285
This'll all be over in a second.

662
00:49:25,286 --> 00:49:26,887
They only arrest the trannies.

663
00:49:26,888 --> 00:49:28,990
It's the "three article of clothing" rule.

664
00:49:28,991 --> 00:49:30,258
They're also gonna arrest the dykes

665
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:32,092
because they're wearing men's clothes.

666
00:49:32,093 --> 00:49:35,430
This is what we're fighting
against, this bullshit.

667
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:37,631
No, no. You stay right there, okay.

668
00:49:37,632 --> 00:49:39,300
You should come to one of our meetings.

669
00:49:39,301 --> 00:49:41,235
Around the corner on Christopher Street.

670
00:49:41,236 --> 00:49:42,903
I'll be seeing you, Danny.

671
00:49:42,904 --> 00:49:45,072
Let's see some IDs here.

672
00:49:45,073 --> 00:49:48,042
Ray. Ray.

673
00:49:52,013 --> 00:49:54,949
If any of you Lily Law girls wanna dance,

674
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:55,983
well, here I am.

675
00:49:57,152 --> 00:49:58,586
Ten cents a dance.

676
00:49:58,587 --> 00:50:00,354
For all men in uniforms...

677
00:50:00,355 --> 00:50:01,655
Out of here. Let's go.

678
00:50:03,424 --> 00:50:06,327
Life is free!

679
00:50:06,328 --> 00:50:08,996
Life is free!

680
00:50:08,997 --> 00:50:11,499
Hey, ain't your mother
never teach you no respect?

681
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,534
Jesus, God!

682
00:50:13,535 --> 00:50:15,336
What a fuckin' disgrace you are.

683
00:50:15,337 --> 00:50:16,970
More than you?

684
00:50:16,971 --> 00:50:18,372
I know y'all pigs get paid off

685
00:50:18,373 --> 00:50:19,574
every time you raid this place.

686
00:50:19,575 --> 00:50:21,008
I probably paid for all

687
00:50:21,009 --> 00:50:22,142
of your kids' Christmas presents.

688
00:50:22,143 --> 00:50:23,677
Oh, Jesus Christ!

689
00:50:23,678 --> 00:50:25,313
Fuck, man!

690
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:26,613
You fuckin' mention my kids, huh?

691
00:50:26,614 --> 00:50:28,584
Officer!

692
00:50:30,252 --> 00:50:35,222
Well, mister,

693
00:50:35,223 --> 00:50:39,260
I actually only have

694
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:42,664
one item of clothing.

695
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:44,298
I made it myself.

696
00:50:49,605 --> 00:50:51,539
Isn't it gorgeous?

697
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,641
Get this bitch out of my sight!

698
00:50:53,642 --> 00:50:56,244
Get your hands off me!

699
00:50:58,547 --> 00:51:00,447
I want everybody's ID
or everybody's cuffed.

700
00:51:00,448 --> 00:51:03,384
I want some ID right now.

701
00:51:07,256 --> 00:51:10,959
Get out of here. I want some ID!

702
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,226
Fuck! Danny! Ow!

703
00:51:12,227 --> 00:51:13,727
Shit!

704
00:51:13,728 --> 00:51:15,195
- Ray!
- Danny!

705
00:51:15,196 --> 00:51:16,197
- You wanna go, too?
- Okay, okay.

706
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:21,034
Fairy queens of Sheridan Square are here.

707
00:51:21,035 --> 00:51:22,570
Just my fuckin' luck.

708
00:51:22,571 --> 00:51:24,204
Hi, Sam.

709
00:51:24,205 --> 00:51:26,240
No sign of Murphy.

710
00:51:26,241 --> 00:51:27,307
Somebody tipped him off.

711
00:51:27,308 --> 00:51:29,310
Maybe.

712
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,447
Who's that guy?

713
00:51:32,448 --> 00:51:34,648
- Fields?
- That sergeant out of the 6th.

714
00:51:34,649 --> 00:51:36,383
He's a good man.

715
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,318
Is he?

716
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,021
Well, that'd be a new one
because the information I have

717
00:51:40,022 --> 00:51:42,991
is the whole fuckin' precinct is rotten.

718
00:51:45,294 --> 00:51:47,328
Keep an eye on him.

719
00:51:48,464 --> 00:51:49,597
- Here.
- Thanks.

720
00:51:49,598 --> 00:51:51,099
Why are they doing this?

721
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,666
I don't know, Sam,

722
00:51:52,667 --> 00:51:55,336
but it's getting very, very predictable.

723
00:51:55,337 --> 00:51:57,637
What else is there but to
enjoy the parade, right?

724
00:51:57,638 --> 00:51:59,740
Enjoy it? I can't get arrested.

725
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,541
I have kids. I have a husband.

726
00:52:01,542 --> 00:52:03,144
Fuck!

727
00:52:03,145 --> 00:52:05,746
You don't know what you're
fuckin' talking about!

728
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,447
Sir, sir!

729
00:52:07,448 --> 00:52:09,117
What precinct are they going to?

730
00:52:09,118 --> 00:52:10,517
Sir?

731
00:52:10,518 --> 00:52:13,755
Jesus Christ! Come on! Get off of me!

732
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:14,755
Hi, mommy!

733
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,124
Hmm.

734
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:17,358
Oh!

735
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:19,293
You okay?

736
00:52:19,294 --> 00:52:23,030
Jesus, Jack. We do the raids.

737
00:52:23,031 --> 00:52:27,101
This our... This is our gig.

738
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,602
Who's this Pine anyway?

739
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:31,139
Look, he's new. He's
a total straight arrow.

740
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,773
Yeah, just our luck, huh?

741
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,142
Hey, hey! That's my lipstick.

742
00:52:35,143 --> 00:52:37,144
Get your pig hands off
my lipstick, motherfucker!

743
00:52:37,145 --> 00:52:41,381
It ain't no deadly fuckin' weapon, bitch.

744
00:52:41,382 --> 00:52:44,184
Can you spare a cigarette for a lady?

745
00:52:44,185 --> 00:52:46,153
Start with this one.

746
00:52:46,154 --> 00:52:48,322
Interpol has asked us to
look into the Stonewall.

747
00:52:48,323 --> 00:52:49,724
This dump?

748
00:52:49,725 --> 00:52:50,691
Yeah. Apparently some
bonds disappeared from

749
00:52:50,692 --> 00:52:52,126
the Federal Depository,

750
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,061
then they appeared somewhere in Europe.

751
00:52:54,062 --> 00:52:55,729
Interpol thinks that Ed's got some of those

752
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:57,731
nelly Wall Street boys, who hang out here,

753
00:52:57,732 --> 00:52:59,400
by the balls and he's squeezing them.

754
00:52:59,401 --> 00:53:01,235
It's a fuckin' sewer,

755
00:53:01,236 --> 00:53:03,471
and you're up to your neck in it, Walt.

756
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:18,185
Don't blow smoke in my face.

757
00:53:20,388 --> 00:53:21,688
Look, you cooperate with me,

758
00:53:21,689 --> 00:53:23,724
you'll be out of here in a few minutes.

759
00:53:23,725 --> 00:53:25,159
That's new.

760
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,160
I need to know about Ed Murphy.

761
00:53:27,161 --> 00:53:28,162
Who?

762
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:31,532
Hey, you know exactly
who I'm talking about.

763
00:53:31,533 --> 00:53:32,633
Has he asked you to be bait?

764
00:53:32,634 --> 00:53:35,202
Bait? Like for fishing?

765
00:53:35,203 --> 00:53:36,871
Can we skip the cute part?

766
00:53:36,872 --> 00:53:39,106
You know what happens
to kids who play dumb?

767
00:53:39,107 --> 00:53:41,042
What?

768
00:53:43,645 --> 00:53:46,514
You know this kid?

769
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:49,282
- No.
- Justin Blake,

770
00:53:49,283 --> 00:53:52,186
17 years old from Port
Jefferson, Long Island.

771
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,887
A frequent customer at the Stonewall

772
00:53:53,888 --> 00:53:56,224
and a very desirable piece of hustler ass,

773
00:53:56,225 --> 00:53:58,326
wouldn't you say?

774
00:54:00,828 --> 00:54:02,696
What happened to him?

775
00:54:04,232 --> 00:54:06,334
This.

776
00:54:15,611 --> 00:54:18,179
Now we think that's Ed Murphy's handiwork.

777
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,746
One of the tricks he was
running out of the bar.

778
00:54:19,747 --> 00:54:21,782
So what do you need me for? Go get him.

779
00:54:21,783 --> 00:54:22,883
What do you know about this?

780
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:24,519
I told you. I don't know nothing.

781
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,220
You're fuckin' lying to me

782
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,289
'cause I can see it in your eyes.

783
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:30,925
What are you protecting?
This guy's a piece of shit.

784
00:54:30,926 --> 00:54:33,693
He kills kids.

785
00:54:33,694 --> 00:54:35,530
Help me.

786
00:54:35,531 --> 00:54:37,732
Help me, please!

787
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:45,273
What the fuck is wrong with you people?

788
00:54:45,274 --> 00:54:47,441
Are all of you just stupid,
is that part of being gay?

789
00:54:47,442 --> 00:54:48,943
No!

790
00:54:48,944 --> 00:54:50,610
But getting fucked up by
the cops sure seems to be.

791
00:54:50,611 --> 00:54:54,215
I know. I'm sorry.

792
00:54:55,616 --> 00:54:57,618
You can go.

793
00:55:00,821 --> 00:55:02,923
Here's my card,

794
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:06,193
if you decide to remember anything.

795
00:55:06,194 --> 00:55:08,330
Go.

796
00:55:16,638 --> 00:55:18,905
Oh, no, I'm not talking to you.

797
00:55:18,906 --> 00:55:20,775
At all.

798
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,443
I just waited a whole night for you.

799
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:26,447
Oh, she waited all night.
How Cinde-fucking-rella!

800
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:29,383
What have I done?

801
00:55:29,384 --> 00:55:31,251
You danced with that guy?

802
00:55:31,252 --> 00:55:32,186
Don't think I don't
know anything about him.

803
00:55:32,187 --> 00:55:33,854
His name is Trevor, and he likes to impress

804
00:55:33,855 --> 00:55:36,891
little boys like you with his politics,

805
00:55:36,892 --> 00:55:39,827
when all he really wants to do is fuck you.

806
00:55:39,828 --> 00:55:41,362
God, are you jealous?

807
00:55:41,363 --> 00:55:42,796
- Oh, please!
- Come on!

808
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:45,298
He's so smooth. He's so smart.

809
00:55:45,299 --> 00:55:46,800
You know what I learned about smart people?

810
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:49,336
They care about one thing, themselves.

811
00:55:49,337 --> 00:55:50,738
Hey, come on.

812
00:55:50,739 --> 00:55:52,305
All right. I'm sorry I
danced with him, all right?

813
00:55:52,306 --> 00:55:53,474
Yeah.

814
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,943
How about I buy us breakfast?
We'll go to Big Daddy's.

815
00:55:55,944 --> 00:55:57,845
Look, I got more than $5 left.

816
00:55:57,846 --> 00:56:01,249
I never noticed you were such a rich man.

817
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:03,950
You can have whatever you want.

818
00:56:03,951 --> 00:56:05,852
Baby, you know that's not true,

819
00:56:05,853 --> 00:56:07,488
but it's sweet that
they raise boys in Kansas

820
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:09,356
to be such gentlemen.

821
00:56:09,357 --> 00:56:13,026
Yeah, right. Yeah, in
Kansas they do. Right.

822
00:56:13,027 --> 00:56:14,528
You do know who the most important person

823
00:56:14,529 --> 00:56:17,664
in Kansas is now? Dorothy.

824
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:19,700
Dorothy Gale.

825
00:56:21,435 --> 00:56:23,671
<i>From the Wizard of Oz?</i>

826
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:26,675
Jesus! You don't know nothing, do you?

827
00:56:30,779 --> 00:56:35,383
So, we will be meeting
here three nights a week,

828
00:56:35,384 --> 00:56:36,416
same time,

829
00:56:36,417 --> 00:56:38,285
and at the end of this,

830
00:56:38,286 --> 00:56:41,389
you will receive three
credits towards your diploma.

831
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:43,858
If you should miss three classes,

832
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:46,394
you will be automatically failed.

833
00:56:46,395 --> 00:56:48,362
Any questions?

834
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:06,513
Lee.

835
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:12,353
Who's that?

836
00:57:23,765 --> 00:57:25,599
He, uh, he wants you.

837
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,101
What? What do you mean?

838
00:57:27,102 --> 00:57:30,338
Well, he fancies you, man.
He's one of my regulars.

839
00:57:30,339 --> 00:57:32,505
Didn't you say you're out of cash?

840
00:57:32,506 --> 00:57:34,441
- Here's your chance.
- Come on, man.

841
00:57:34,442 --> 00:57:36,510
Oh, no, man. No. Come on! That's not my...

842
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,646
- I don't do that, man.
- His name is Jack.

843
00:57:38,647 --> 00:57:39,780
He's an accountant with a wife

844
00:57:39,781 --> 00:57:41,115
and a bunch of kids, all right?

845
00:57:41,116 --> 00:57:43,617
Now I told him that you're
new and it's gonna be $25,

846
00:57:43,618 --> 00:57:45,452
but he's gonna try to get
you to settle for less,

847
00:57:45,453 --> 00:57:46,921
- just don't let that happen.
- Twenty-five?

848
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:49,657
Yeah, man. He's just gonna
suck you off. That's it.

849
00:57:49,658 --> 00:57:52,727
Look, it's nothing, okay? Just go!

850
00:57:54,663 --> 00:57:57,497
Have fun, man.

851
00:57:57,498 --> 00:57:59,432
Hey. I'm Danny.

852
00:57:59,433 --> 00:58:02,569
Nice to meet you. I'm Jack.

853
00:58:31,832 --> 00:58:33,800
Jack, do you think maybe I could have

854
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,535
my money first, please?

855
00:58:35,536 --> 00:58:36,670
- Your money?
- Yeah.

856
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,939
Oh, yes. Sure.

857
00:58:41,609 --> 00:58:43,110
It was 15, right?

858
00:58:43,111 --> 00:58:45,613
No, Lee said 25.

859
00:58:45,614 --> 00:58:47,615
Oh, yeah.

860
00:58:51,051 --> 00:58:52,953
Thanks.

861
00:59:34,062 --> 00:59:36,463
Hey, Danny.

862
00:59:36,464 --> 00:59:38,565
Here.

863
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:43,171
Still hanging out with your
little street gang, huh?

864
00:59:44,538 --> 00:59:45,738
What have you got against them?

865
00:59:45,739 --> 00:59:49,976
Nothing. It's just...

866
00:59:49,977 --> 00:59:51,211
You don't seem like the type of guy

867
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:52,113
who wants to hang out at the Stonewall

868
00:59:52,114 --> 00:59:54,148
and turn tricks with your girlfriends.

869
00:59:54,149 --> 00:59:57,117
You know, wearing red
lipstick, nail polish.

870
00:59:57,118 --> 00:59:59,787
Well that's because red's not my color.

871
00:59:59,788 --> 01:00:01,621
They've been better friends
to me than most of the people

872
01:00:01,622 --> 01:00:04,057
I thought were my friends my whole life.

873
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:06,460
That's 'cause you didn't
have the right friends.

874
01:00:07,661 --> 01:00:09,496
Come to the meeting.

875
01:00:09,497 --> 01:00:13,200
We got shitty coffee, crappy cookies.

876
01:00:43,665 --> 01:00:45,767
Ray?

877
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:48,969
Ray?

878
01:00:57,712 --> 01:01:00,014
Oh, Jesus! What happened?

879
01:01:00,015 --> 01:01:02,083
Who did this to you?

880
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:07,086
What do you mean, "Who did this?"

881
01:01:07,087 --> 01:01:10,590
If you're lucky, they pay you for it.

882
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,295
Stop tricking, Ray.

883
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:16,764
And then what?

884
01:01:16,765 --> 01:01:18,932
What?

885
01:01:18,933 --> 01:01:20,901
Tell me!

886
01:01:22,203 --> 01:01:26,074
You wanna know where home is for me, Danny?

887
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:31,644
Nowhere.

888
01:01:31,645 --> 01:01:37,351
There is no home. There
is no family, Danny.

889
01:01:37,352 --> 01:01:39,987
All there is,

890
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:42,990
is some guy in fuckin' Sing Sing

891
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:45,059
who might be my dad,

892
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:48,729
and I don't know where my mom is.

893
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:53,834
My sister, she's in foster care,

894
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:58,838
and I got a dead grandma in Ponce.

895
01:01:58,839 --> 01:02:01,842
Happy fuckin' family!

896
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,677
What the fuck am I supposed to do, Danny?

897
01:02:04,678 --> 01:02:07,814
Nobody wants me!

898
01:02:09,951 --> 01:02:11,918
Nobody!

899
01:02:11,919 --> 01:02:14,988
Not even you!

900
01:02:14,989 --> 01:02:18,325
I don't have anything!

901
01:02:18,326 --> 01:02:19,459
So what...

902
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:21,961
So what if I fuckin' get
beat up every now and then?

903
01:02:21,962 --> 01:02:24,163
Who the fuck doesn't?

904
01:02:25,966 --> 01:02:30,104
A faggot is always going to
get beat up, Danny, even you.

905
01:02:30,105 --> 01:02:32,773
Either from another faggot,

906
01:02:32,774 --> 01:02:34,842
or from a cop,

907
01:02:34,843 --> 01:02:38,177
or from a trick,

908
01:02:38,178 --> 01:02:41,148
who's got something to prove.

909
01:02:41,149 --> 01:02:43,151
No big deal.

910
01:02:47,022 --> 01:02:48,688
Maybe I can look, you know?

911
01:02:50,859 --> 01:02:55,729
Maybe I can look and see if I
can find us something better.

912
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:58,299
Why do you care?

913
01:03:00,268 --> 01:03:01,802
Because you're my friend.

914
01:03:01,803 --> 01:03:04,172
What?

915
01:03:05,973 --> 01:03:08,609
Because you're my friend.

916
01:03:12,047 --> 01:03:15,016
I'm sorry.

917
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:18,351
Come here.

918
01:03:18,352 --> 01:03:20,954
I'm sorry.

919
01:03:20,955 --> 01:03:23,057
Come here. Come here. Shh! Shh!

920
01:03:31,399 --> 01:03:32,766
I'm tired.

921
01:03:52,786 --> 01:03:54,488
- Wake up!
- What? What?

922
01:03:54,489 --> 01:03:57,256
So, did he give this to you?

923
01:03:57,257 --> 01:03:58,925
No, some other guy gave it to me.

924
01:03:58,926 --> 01:04:01,427
Why are you lying to me?

925
01:04:01,428 --> 01:04:03,731
What?

926
01:04:03,732 --> 01:04:06,401
Oh, give it a rest, Ray, please.

927
01:04:09,069 --> 01:04:12,371
You know, Danny,

928
01:04:12,372 --> 01:04:16,443
you're turning out to be
a real New York cocksucker.

929
01:04:16,444 --> 01:04:19,913
Learning how to lie before
you even get dressed!

930
01:04:24,852 --> 01:04:27,454
What the fuck was that?

931
01:04:32,292 --> 01:04:34,862
<i>More and more we are
seeing that homosexuals</i>

932
01:04:34,863 --> 01:04:38,131
<i>will no longer tolerate
discrimination.</i>

933
01:04:38,132 --> 01:04:42,503
<i>People will recognize
that gay is good.</i>

934
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:45,805
<i>The American people
will start to understand</i>

935
01:04:45,806 --> 01:04:50,910
<i>that firing us for being
gay is just plain wrong,</i>

936
01:04:50,911 --> 01:04:54,114
<i>and that is the day
we are working for.</i>

937
01:04:55,817 --> 01:04:58,117
<i>But we have to fight
in a peaceful way</i>

938
01:04:58,118 --> 01:05:00,220
<i>and resist the radicalism</i>

939
01:05:00,221 --> 01:05:02,856
<i>that I see starting to
take hold in some quarters.</i>

940
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,458
<i>Don't forget,</i>

941
01:05:04,459 --> 01:05:07,260
<i>wearing a suit and tie
will make them understand</i>

942
01:05:07,261 --> 01:05:08,961
<i>you're just like them...</i>

943
01:05:08,962 --> 01:05:12,033
<i>That's how we win!</i>

944
01:05:16,069 --> 01:05:18,104
With the new appointments to the Court,

945
01:05:18,105 --> 01:05:19,438
we're pretty optimistic

946
01:05:19,439 --> 01:05:22,041
that the right action
in the right jurisdiction

947
01:05:22,042 --> 01:05:24,878
might actually get us a little
closer to where we want to go.

948
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,313
Um, excuse me.

949
01:05:26,314 --> 01:05:27,814
Do you mind if I ask you a quick question?

950
01:05:27,815 --> 01:05:29,016
Not at all.

951
01:05:29,017 --> 01:05:30,918
Um, you're an astronomer, right?

952
01:05:30,919 --> 01:05:32,485
By training, yes, I am.

953
01:05:32,486 --> 01:05:34,188
I'm actually going to Columbia in the fall

954
01:05:34,189 --> 01:05:35,322
and was hoping to do the same thing,

955
01:05:35,323 --> 01:05:38,025
and maybe end up at NASA.

956
01:05:38,026 --> 01:05:40,894
I was wondering if you
might have some advice or...

957
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:42,863
They fired me.

958
01:05:42,864 --> 01:05:45,064
You can't be a homosexual
and work for the government.

959
01:05:45,065 --> 01:05:48,202
You're going to have
to find something else.

960
01:05:48,203 --> 01:05:51,104
We're not there yet, I'm sad to say.

961
01:05:51,105 --> 01:05:54,474
Sorry. But we will be.

962
01:05:54,475 --> 01:05:58,345
It's a long journey, a long road.

963
01:05:58,346 --> 01:06:01,048
Right. Thank you, sir.

964
01:06:01,049 --> 01:06:03,584
Thank you.

965
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:05,453
Hey, Danny.

966
01:06:07,221 --> 01:06:08,856
Thanks for coming.

967
01:06:08,857 --> 01:06:11,023
Yeah. It was great.

968
01:06:11,024 --> 01:06:12,291
I mean, aside from being told
that what I want to be in life

969
01:06:12,292 --> 01:06:14,193
isn't available to me because I'm gay.

970
01:06:14,194 --> 01:06:18,064
Sure. That's what we're trying to change.

971
01:06:18,065 --> 01:06:19,266
People like Frank Kameny

972
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:20,934
have been fighting this battle for years.

973
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:22,936
No one has done as much
for our cause as he has.

974
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,938
What, by wearing a suit and tie?

975
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,039
Come on!

976
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,441
Is that really what you want?

977
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:28,575
To blend in?

978
01:06:28,576 --> 01:06:31,110
I mean, we are different, right?

979
01:06:31,111 --> 01:06:32,378
You know, I'm beginning to realize

980
01:06:32,379 --> 01:06:33,579
just how different we really are.

981
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:35,081
Yeah, like wearing a dress

982
01:06:35,082 --> 01:06:37,084
and prancing up and
down Christopher Street?

983
01:06:37,085 --> 01:06:39,086
Hey, it takes a lot more
balls to wear a dress

984
01:06:39,087 --> 01:06:41,255
than it does a suit and tie.

985
01:06:41,256 --> 01:06:42,588
What would you have me do, huh?

986
01:06:42,589 --> 01:06:45,224
Be a fuckin' florist or decorator?

987
01:06:46,493 --> 01:06:48,028
Come on!

988
01:06:48,029 --> 01:06:51,030
What, are these the options open to me?

989
01:06:51,031 --> 01:06:54,066
Of course not.

990
01:06:54,067 --> 01:06:57,070
You know, I'm getting to really feel like

991
01:06:57,071 --> 01:06:59,539
I just want to break something, you know?

992
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,909
Me too.

993
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:04,677
But you're not gonna, are you?

994
01:07:04,678 --> 01:07:06,380
Ever.

995
01:07:06,381 --> 01:07:09,282
Look...

996
01:07:09,283 --> 01:07:11,184
Why don't you let me buy you some dinner?

997
01:07:11,185 --> 01:07:14,621
I don't know about you,
but I'm starving. Come on.

998
01:07:14,622 --> 01:07:18,258
My folks are liberals,

999
01:07:18,259 --> 01:07:20,961
or maybe I just outwitted them.

1000
01:07:20,962 --> 01:07:22,461
You outwitted them. What did you tell them?

1001
01:07:22,462 --> 01:07:23,996
Let me get this straight.

1002
01:07:23,997 --> 01:07:26,566
Your version of fairness and equality

1003
01:07:26,567 --> 01:07:28,467
ends with who you sleep with?

1004
01:07:28,468 --> 01:07:30,604
That's nuts.

1005
01:07:30,605 --> 01:07:33,072
So every family dinner,
I just threw it at them

1006
01:07:33,073 --> 01:07:35,008
until they surrendered.

1007
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:37,443
That's how you do it.

1008
01:07:37,444 --> 01:07:39,313
- With words.
- Wow.

1009
01:07:39,314 --> 01:07:40,447
I mean, my family is like,

1010
01:07:40,448 --> 01:07:42,481
"He's turned to a pillar of salt."

1011
01:07:42,482 --> 01:07:46,353
Danny, you can't let them shame you.

1012
01:07:48,256 --> 01:07:49,588
I miss them so much,

1013
01:07:49,589 --> 01:07:53,193
especially my little sister, you know.

1014
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:57,396
All of that just taken away
from me because I got caught.

1015
01:07:57,397 --> 01:07:59,499
With some guy?

1016
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:03,336
No, not some guy.

1017
01:08:03,337 --> 01:08:07,407
I've known Joe my whole life.

1018
01:08:07,408 --> 01:08:10,276
I was in love with him.

1019
01:08:10,277 --> 01:08:13,613
You know, when we got busted, he just...

1020
01:08:13,614 --> 01:08:16,650
Turned his back on you.

1021
01:08:16,651 --> 01:08:19,518
Yeah... And you left.

1022
01:08:19,519 --> 01:08:21,354
Why didn't you fight back?

1023
01:08:21,355 --> 01:08:23,357
Do you know anything
about life in a small town

1024
01:08:23,358 --> 01:08:25,192
and what happens to you

1025
01:08:25,193 --> 01:08:27,094
when you suddenly become disgusting?

1026
01:08:30,364 --> 01:08:34,134
You will never be disgusting,

1027
01:08:34,135 --> 01:08:38,138
and I really wanna know everything.

1028
01:08:38,139 --> 01:08:40,608
Everything about you.

1029
01:09:48,376 --> 01:09:49,843
Hey.

1030
01:09:49,844 --> 01:09:52,512
Hey.

1031
01:09:52,513 --> 01:09:54,715
I don't want you to go.

1032
01:09:58,118 --> 01:10:01,687
Look, I know this is sudden,

1033
01:10:01,688 --> 01:10:04,458
but you need a safe place to stay.

1034
01:10:04,459 --> 01:10:07,594
Why don't you just stay here, with me?

1035
01:10:07,595 --> 01:10:10,531
You know, for a little while.

1036
01:10:16,136 --> 01:10:17,870
You still drunk, or are
you just talking shit?

1037
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:21,875
No.

1038
01:10:21,876 --> 01:10:23,543
You can get a job,

1039
01:10:23,544 --> 01:10:26,713
start paying me some rent
so it doesn't feel weird.

1040
01:10:26,714 --> 01:10:28,647
Look, Danny.

1041
01:10:28,648 --> 01:10:32,585
Something happened to me when
I saw you at the Stonewall.

1042
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:37,224
I kind of fell into deep water.

1043
01:10:39,393 --> 01:10:42,696
So stay, okay?

1044
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:50,704
Winters' residence.

1045
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:52,539
<i>Danny?</i>

1046
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:54,473
Are you still in New York?

1047
01:10:54,474 --> 01:10:56,776
Yes, Mom. Look, I called for Phoebe, okay?

1048
01:10:56,777 --> 01:10:58,844
Are you all right?

1049
01:10:58,845 --> 01:11:01,615
I pray for you, every day.

1050
01:11:01,616 --> 01:11:03,683
I don't need you to pray for me, Mom.

1051
01:11:03,684 --> 01:11:06,253
I need you to sign my goddamn
scholarship application

1052
01:11:06,254 --> 01:11:07,553
<i>and send it in, all right?</i>

1053
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:09,522
<i>That will be a lot
better than prayers.</i>

1054
01:11:10,892 --> 01:11:14,694
Can you please just get Phebes, all right?

1055
01:11:16,697 --> 01:11:19,500
Phoebe, it's Danny on the phone.

1056
01:11:24,804 --> 01:11:27,707
Danny, Danny! Hold on.

1057
01:11:29,809 --> 01:11:30,911
<i>Got it?</i>

1058
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:33,179
Trevor Nichols.

1059
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:34,647
Okay. Got it.

1060
01:11:34,648 --> 01:11:36,616
So how's it going, Phebes?

1061
01:11:36,617 --> 01:11:40,754
Mom and Dad are fighting every day.

1062
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:42,656
I stopped talking to either one of them.

1063
01:11:42,657 --> 01:11:43,589
<i>I just can't wait
to get out of here.</i>

1064
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,392
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

1065
01:11:45,393 --> 01:11:47,594
Hey, have you met Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis yet?

1066
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:49,528
Or Andy Warhol?

1067
01:11:49,529 --> 01:11:51,263
Yeah. No, we have lunch
every other day, stupid.

1068
01:11:56,504 --> 01:12:00,607
Look what the cat dragged in.

1069
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:02,375
Hey, guys.

1070
01:12:02,376 --> 01:12:05,344
So I just want to tell you
all that, um, I got a place

1071
01:12:05,345 --> 01:12:07,813
or somewhere, you know,
to live for a little bit.

1072
01:12:07,814 --> 01:12:09,516
Where?

1073
01:12:09,517 --> 01:12:11,919
It's Trevor's place.

1074
01:12:16,489 --> 01:12:20,227
Oooh, honey, honey, me oh my!

1075
01:12:20,228 --> 01:12:21,995
Columbia's leaving us for good.

1076
01:12:21,996 --> 01:12:24,296
Danny Boy's found himself a nice, rich,

1077
01:12:24,297 --> 01:12:26,232
smart sugar daddy.

1078
01:12:26,233 --> 01:12:28,567
Look, you only been here
for like two months, right?

1079
01:12:28,568 --> 01:12:31,271
Damn! A quick learner, right, girls?

1080
01:12:31,272 --> 01:12:32,772
Maybe you could teach me a trick or two.

1081
01:12:32,773 --> 01:12:34,574
Why are you such an asshole?

1082
01:12:34,575 --> 01:12:36,776
No! I'm proud.

1083
01:12:36,777 --> 01:12:38,411
Baby, you played it right,

1084
01:12:38,412 --> 01:12:40,312
moving your little country boy ass indoors.

1085
01:12:40,313 --> 01:12:42,281
And what's wrong with that, huh?

1086
01:12:42,282 --> 01:12:44,483
Well, like your life is so great, Ray?

1087
01:12:44,484 --> 01:12:46,620
Getting beat up all the time
and blowing guys in doorways?

1088
01:12:46,621 --> 01:12:49,356
Yeah! A life of excitement, baby!

1089
01:12:49,357 --> 01:12:50,723
You know, the last time I saw you,

1090
01:12:50,724 --> 01:12:53,626
you were begging me to
get out of this life.

1091
01:12:54,961 --> 01:12:57,464
Let me tell you something, hmm?

1092
01:12:57,465 --> 01:13:00,366
The difference between
us, I don't have a choice,

1093
01:13:00,367 --> 01:13:01,634
and you just wanted a little time

1094
01:13:01,635 --> 01:13:02,736
with someone in the streets.

1095
01:13:02,737 --> 01:13:04,737
What, so tricking was just
an adventure in your story?

1096
01:13:04,738 --> 01:13:08,275
I know what this is, this
is a little funny story

1097
01:13:08,276 --> 01:13:13,713
about Ray and Lee and
Paul and Cong and Annie.

1098
01:13:13,714 --> 01:13:16,950
Funny fuckin' story, isn't it?

1099
01:13:16,951 --> 01:13:20,621
Let's go!

1100
01:13:34,402 --> 01:13:36,068
I guess I need my stuff.

1101
01:13:36,069 --> 01:13:37,937
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm sure!

1102
01:13:37,938 --> 01:13:39,071
I can't sit in the park like you all day

1103
01:13:39,072 --> 01:13:41,674
watching the world go by, can I?

1104
01:13:41,675 --> 01:13:43,543
Fuck! I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

1105
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:45,077
I was rude. I'm sorry.

1106
01:13:45,078 --> 01:13:51,817
Yes, but like a lot of rude
things, very, very true.

1107
01:13:51,818 --> 01:13:54,420
You were in the Navy?

1108
01:13:54,421 --> 01:13:57,357
South Pacific.

1109
01:13:57,358 --> 01:13:59,425
I was 18.

1110
01:13:59,426 --> 01:14:02,027
You had to be a total dick
not to serve in that one.

1111
01:14:02,028 --> 01:14:04,563
But Vietnam, wouldn't go near it.

1112
01:14:04,564 --> 01:14:06,598
Oh, thanks.

1113
01:14:06,599 --> 01:14:07,733
Yeah, I thought about enlisting

1114
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:09,001
when my parents kicked me out.

1115
01:14:09,002 --> 01:14:10,603
You know, just to spite them.

1116
01:14:10,604 --> 01:14:12,539
You're damn lucky you didn't.

1117
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:19,079
Look, Ray started tricking in
Times Square when he was 12.

1118
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,714
This isn't him being mean to you.

1119
01:14:20,715 --> 01:14:24,017
He just loves you, is all.

1120
01:14:24,018 --> 01:14:26,652
And love isn't always pretty.

1121
01:14:26,653 --> 01:14:29,555
They should put that on a poster.

1122
01:14:29,556 --> 01:14:31,425
He'll get over it.

1123
01:14:33,027 --> 01:14:35,461
Eventually.

1124
01:14:35,462 --> 01:14:37,563
Every guy has to get over
being in love with someone

1125
01:14:37,564 --> 01:14:40,032
who can't love him back.

1126
01:14:40,033 --> 01:14:42,602
What makes you so sure that's what it is?

1127
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:45,104
I know the look.

1128
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:47,506
He just needs friends, is all,

1129
01:14:47,507 --> 01:14:49,442
and if he can stick the
endless goddamn abuse,

1130
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:50,677
he'll be there for you, Danny.

1131
01:14:54,381 --> 01:14:55,514
Hi.

1132
01:14:55,515 --> 01:14:57,884
Hey.

1133
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:02,455
And he is...

1134
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:03,589
Danny, Terry.

1135
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:05,424
Terry, Danny.

1136
01:15:05,425 --> 01:15:06,659
- Hi.
- Hi.

1137
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:07,960
Staying for dinner?

1138
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:11,063
I'm making spaghetti and meatballs.

1139
01:15:11,064 --> 01:15:12,898
Wait, sorry. You guys live together?

1140
01:15:12,899 --> 01:15:14,000
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

1141
01:15:14,001 --> 01:15:15,402
Haven't killed each other yet,

1142
01:15:15,403 --> 01:15:17,103
even though this is a storage facility

1143
01:15:17,104 --> 01:15:19,071
for every street kid below 14th Street.

1144
01:15:19,072 --> 01:15:20,874
And he loves you a lot
more than he loves me.

1145
01:15:20,875 --> 01:15:22,442
Yep, sure do.

1146
01:15:22,443 --> 01:15:23,710
Mmm-hmm.

1147
01:15:23,711 --> 01:15:24,777
'Cause you're so square.

1148
01:15:24,778 --> 01:15:26,646
How long have you...

1149
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:31,617
Put up with this bullshit?
Almost four years.

1150
01:15:31,618 --> 01:15:33,820
Stay for dinner. We, uh, love company.

1151
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:37,956
That just sounds just great,
but I gotta be somewhere.

1152
01:15:37,957 --> 01:15:40,927
Thanks, Bob.

1153
01:15:40,928 --> 01:15:41,928
It was real nice meeting you.

1154
01:15:41,929 --> 01:15:44,131
Nice meeting you, too.

- Hey!</i>

1160
01:15:59,647 --> 01:16:01,747
Guess what?

1161
01:16:01,748 --> 01:16:03,817
Your boyfriend is working
at the Italian grocery store.

1162
01:16:03,818 --> 01:16:05,985
How do you know that?

1163
01:16:05,986 --> 01:16:08,153
'Cause we saw him there.

1164
01:16:08,154 --> 01:16:10,523
Baby, you want a plum?

1165
01:16:17,163 --> 01:16:19,665
So you got a lady's stocking in a size one

1166
01:16:19,666 --> 01:16:22,235
or is that on the other floor, miss?

1167
01:16:22,236 --> 01:16:23,736
No, all right.

1168
01:16:23,737 --> 01:16:26,540
What about a Puerto Rican Koko Blanco bar?

1169
01:16:27,675 --> 01:16:29,741
What do you want, Ray?

1170
01:16:29,742 --> 01:16:34,647
I just need a pack of cigarettes, Danny.

1171
01:16:34,648 --> 01:16:36,014
Look, I wouldn't ask. I'm sorry.

1172
01:16:36,015 --> 01:16:37,083
It's an emergency.

1173
01:16:37,084 --> 01:16:39,986
Ray, I've had this job
for two weeks, all right?

1174
01:16:39,987 --> 01:16:42,187
Danny, Judy just died.

1175
01:16:42,188 --> 01:16:44,557
Judy who?

1176
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:47,494
Garland!

1177
01:16:47,495 --> 01:16:49,595
- Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
- In London.

1178
01:16:49,596 --> 01:16:51,630
They're flying her body
over to Frank's Mortuary

1179
01:16:51,631 --> 01:16:52,999
on the Upper East Side.

1180
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,835
I mean, I'm going to go
pay my respects and...

1181
01:16:55,836 --> 01:16:57,870
I'm sorry, man.

1182
01:16:57,871 --> 01:16:59,671
You won't even give me
a pack of cigarettes?

1183
01:16:59,672 --> 01:17:03,242
Look, Ray, I cannot
lose this job, all right?

1184
01:17:03,243 --> 01:17:05,178
I got rent and stuff to pay now.

1185
01:17:05,179 --> 01:17:07,847
Okay? Oh, come on!

1186
01:17:07,848 --> 01:17:10,916
You just gonna walk away from me like that?

1187
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:14,521
It's people like you, Danny,
who misunderstood Judy.

1188
01:17:14,522 --> 01:17:15,754
You know, you misunderstand people like me,

1189
01:17:15,755 --> 01:17:16,923
but that's okay.

1190
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:18,590
That's okay. Don't worry about it.

1191
01:17:18,591 --> 01:17:21,160
Go pay your rent. Talk to your boyfriend.

1192
01:17:21,161 --> 01:17:24,563
Do what you gotta do. Forget it.

1193
01:17:24,564 --> 01:17:26,232
Have a nice one.

1194
01:17:26,233 --> 01:17:28,168
Hey!

01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:38,846
Wait there.

1196
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:43,549
Sorry, sir. Can I get a pack of Dorals?

1197
01:17:47,187 --> 01:17:49,656
- There you go.
- Thanks.

1198
01:17:54,595 --> 01:17:57,796
Can I please get menthol?

1199
01:17:57,797 --> 01:18:00,266
I'm really stressed out. I...

1200
01:18:00,267 --> 01:18:01,901
A pack of menthol, please.

1201
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:09,076
Thank you.

1202
01:18:11,612 --> 01:18:13,947

Really?

1205
01:18:23,223 --> 01:18:25,759
Of course I do!

1206
01:18:31,732 --> 01:18:33,867
Good!

1207
01:18:43,277 --> 01:18:46,778
Hey, Trevor. I got a letter from Phoebe.

1208
01:18:46,779 --> 01:18:49,081
And there's also some stuff here for you.

1209
01:18:49,082 --> 01:18:51,750
From a bank or something.

To what? What, to lie to me?

No. You okay?

Yeah.

Listen, could you, uh, when you see him,

1248
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:42,021
could you tell Ray I said goodbye?

gents were asking for.

It's not like you ain't
done this before, kid.

Please, have a seat.

1270
01:23:40,139 --> 01:23:43,242
Let's have some music, shall we?

1271
01:23:51,585 --> 01:23:53,385

Hey. What did you do with him?

1276
01:24:09,568 --> 01:24:11,637
Get the fuck out of here.

1277
01:24:11,638 --> 01:24:15,273
Oh, but I know all about
you and little Georgina Vee.

1278
01:24:15,274 --> 01:24:17,309
I mean, George Vasquez.

1279
01:24:17,310 --> 01:24:19,077
Maybe I should spread the news,

1280
01:24:19,078 --> 01:24:20,646
see what happens.

1281
01:24:20,647 --> 01:24:24,150
A faggot club owner and
a driver for the mob.

1282
01:24:24,151 --> 01:24:26,385
I give it a day.

1283
01:24:49,576 --> 01:24:52,210
I see you've been given a drink.

1284
01:24:52,211 --> 01:24:54,246
Good.

1285
01:24:56,315 --> 01:24:58,550
Danny, right?

1286
01:24:58,551 --> 01:25:02,988
A nice American name.

1287
01:25:02,989 --> 01:25:07,126
Like Scott or Justin.

1288
01:25:09,462 --> 01:25:15,367
I, uh, I wish I could live
in New York, but my work...

1289
01:25:15,368 --> 01:25:18,637
I have to tell you my work is very hard.

1290
01:25:18,638 --> 01:25:23,410
Leaves very little time for pleasure.

1291
01:25:24,544 --> 01:25:27,112
<i>I was in the bedroom
watching The Lucy Show</i>

1292
01:25:27,113 --> 01:25:31,450
and she was struggling so hard

1293
01:25:31,451 --> 01:25:34,786
to put the candies in the box.

1294
01:25:34,787 --> 01:25:35,787
And I understood,

1295
01:25:35,788 --> 01:25:40,259
I understood that
metaphor because that's me.

1296
01:25:42,395 --> 01:25:44,162
I'm always working so hard,

1297
01:25:44,163 --> 01:25:45,531
putting the candies in the box.

1298
01:26:02,648 --> 01:26:04,215
Do you know the Bible, Danny?

1299
01:26:04,216 --> 01:26:05,550
Mmm-hmm.

1300
01:26:05,551 --> 01:26:07,652
Anything from the New Testament?

1301
01:26:07,653 --> 01:26:09,388
- Yeah.
- Ahh.

1302
01:26:09,389 --> 01:26:12,691
The Book of John.

1303
01:26:12,692 --> 01:26:18,296
"You are my friends if you
do what I command of you."

I am a very good friend to nice young boys.

1307
01:26:52,732 --> 01:26:55,201
We have to leave.

1308
01:26:55,202 --> 01:26:57,370
I can't go like this.

1309
01:27:12,486 --> 01:27:15,522
Danny! Danny!

1310
01:27:18,125 --> 01:27:19,758
What the fuck are you doing here?

1311
01:27:19,759 --> 01:27:21,559
What, you didn't notice
there was a fire, man?

1312
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:23,329
Stop kidding around.
Just get me out of here.

1313
01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:25,497
Come on, come on. This way.

1314
01:27:30,403 --> 01:27:33,472
Taxi! Taxi! Whoa!

1315
01:27:33,473 --> 01:27:36,576
Hey, taxi. Hop in.

1316
01:27:39,145 --> 01:27:42,114
Christopher Street, Sheridan Square.

1317
01:27:43,782 --> 01:27:45,617
He had a fuckin' gun, Ray.

1318
01:27:45,618 --> 01:27:48,821
This will not go away, Danny.
We gotta make a deal with him.

1319
01:27:48,822 --> 01:27:50,421
You're gonna make a deal that...

1320
01:27:50,422 --> 01:27:52,157
How do you want to do that?

1321
01:27:52,158 --> 01:27:54,393
I'll handle it, okay?

1322
01:27:56,429 --> 01:27:59,298
How long have they been in there?

1323
01:27:59,299 --> 01:28:00,665
About half an hour.

1324
01:28:00,666 --> 01:28:02,601
Half an hour. Should I be worried?

1325
01:28:02,602 --> 01:28:04,269
Nah. Those girls are vice cops.

1326
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:06,304
They can handle themselves.

1327
01:28:06,305 --> 01:28:07,606
Keep it.

1328
01:28:07,607 --> 01:28:09,709
- Frankie...
- Who's that kid?

1329
01:28:13,712 --> 01:28:18,284
Where is he? Where is he?

1330
01:28:18,285 --> 01:28:19,585
He's in the back.

1331
01:28:19,586 --> 01:28:21,486
Okay. You guys just stay here, all right?

1332
01:28:35,868 --> 01:28:40,472
I got a call about a fire alarm

1333
01:28:40,473 --> 01:28:42,974
and you running out,

1334
01:28:42,975 --> 01:28:46,478
like some thief in the night.

1335
01:28:46,479 --> 01:28:48,680
You go back there

1336
01:28:48,681 --> 01:28:50,583
and you finish that fuckin' trick.

1337
01:28:50,584 --> 01:28:51,784
He's not going back there, Ed.

1338
01:28:51,785 --> 01:28:54,452
What the fuck is this, hustler love?

1339
01:28:54,453 --> 01:28:56,921
Why do all you guys
gotta be such romantics?

1340
01:28:56,922 --> 01:28:59,692
How about I go to the cops and I tell them

1341
01:28:59,693 --> 01:29:02,695
you were the last person with Justin?

1342
01:29:04,863 --> 01:29:06,699
'Cause that would be
the dumbest fuckin' idea

1343
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:11,437
you ever had, and probably your last.

1344
01:29:11,438 --> 01:29:16,275
All I'm saying is let Danny go.

1345
01:29:16,276 --> 01:29:19,245
Everybody knows, Ed.
The cops are on to you.

1346
01:29:19,246 --> 01:29:20,845
They can't lay a finger on me.

1347
01:29:20,846 --> 01:29:23,649
Come on. Get off him.

1348
01:29:26,885 --> 01:29:28,720
Now you play close attention to me.

1349
01:29:28,721 --> 01:29:29,888
You get your faggoty ass

1350
01:29:29,889 --> 01:29:32,023
and you get back to that fuckin' trick.

1351
01:29:32,024 --> 01:29:34,692
He likes you. You're lucky.

1352
01:29:34,693 --> 01:29:36,629
Let's do this.

1353
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:37,830
All units, we're moving in.

1354
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:39,899
<i>Roger.</i>

1355
01:29:42,635 --> 01:29:45,671
Let's go! Let's go either way.

1356
01:29:47,306 --> 01:29:48,973
Police. We're taking the place.

1357
01:29:48,974 --> 01:29:50,375
But you guys did us a couple days ago.

1358
01:29:50,376 --> 01:29:52,311
I'm aware. That was the 6th.

1359
01:29:52,312 --> 01:29:54,580
I don't take payoffs. I'm Morals.

1360
01:29:57,550 --> 01:30:01,419
Why do I get the impression
you just don't fuckin' get it?

1361
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:03,589
All right. This is a raid.

1362
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:06,424
All right. Let's go. Up against the walls.

1363
01:30:06,425 --> 01:30:07,558
Ed. Raid.

1364
01:30:07,559 --> 01:30:10,362
We just had a fuckin' raid!

1365
01:30:13,733 --> 01:30:16,567
Where the fuck is the backdoor key?

1366
01:30:16,568 --> 01:30:19,504
I'm not finished with you fuckin' faggots.

1367
01:30:19,505 --> 01:30:21,406
Get out your false IDs.

1368
01:30:21,407 --> 01:30:22,875
Come on, ladies. I don't have all day.

1369
01:30:22,876 --> 01:30:24,410
- I got that.
- Mmm.

1370
01:30:24,411 --> 01:30:26,312
Let's see some ID, come on.

1371
01:30:26,313 --> 01:30:28,414
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1372
01:30:28,415 --> 01:30:31,517
Come on, let's get out of here.

1373
01:30:31,518 --> 01:30:35,019
Get out your IDs. Let's go!

1374
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:36,754
All right, girls. Pull them IDs.

1375
01:30:36,755 --> 01:30:37,955
Come on, open up those wallets.

1376
01:30:37,956 --> 01:30:39,090
Well, look who it is.

1377
01:30:39,091 --> 01:30:42,494
The elusive, untouchable Mr. Murphy.

1378
01:30:42,495 --> 01:30:44,429
Guess what? You're under arrest.

1379
01:30:44,430 --> 01:30:47,465
Really? What are the charges?

1380
01:30:47,466 --> 01:30:49,335
You really want me to go
through all of them with you

1381
01:30:49,336 --> 01:30:50,068
right now in front of these nice people?

1382
01:30:50,069 --> 01:30:51,669
Yes, I would like that, yeah.

1383
01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:53,906
I don't have the fuckin'
time. Put up your arms.

1384
01:30:58,411 --> 01:31:01,513
You're hurting me, handsome.
Not so rough, mister.

1385
01:31:01,514 --> 01:31:04,516
Hey, Miller. Stop.

1386
01:31:04,517 --> 01:31:06,719
Jack, handcuff these two together.

1387
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:08,786
Really? What the fuck are you doing?

1388
01:31:08,787 --> 01:31:10,857
Trying to be a hero or something?

1389
01:31:14,394 --> 01:31:17,795
Mr. Murphy, some girls look good in Chanel.

1390
01:31:17,796 --> 01:31:20,999
But you look perfect in a
pair of nice shiny handcuffs.

1391
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,401
Shut the fuck up, will you?

1392
01:31:22,402 --> 01:31:23,535
Let's go! Get out of here.

1393
01:31:23,536 --> 01:31:24,669
All right, ladies. Let's go. Come on.

1394
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:27,372
I said, not so rough.

1395
01:31:27,373 --> 01:31:30,541
Come on. Let's go. You
got IDs, you can leave.

1396
01:31:43,689 --> 01:31:45,825
You can go.

1397
01:31:52,732 --> 01:31:55,601
Hello, hello!

1398
01:31:55,602 --> 01:31:57,436
Our lovely Annie!

1399
01:31:57,437 --> 01:32:00,805
Dressed from the Raggedy Ann collection.

1400
01:32:00,806 --> 01:32:03,142
Work the runway, girl.

1401
01:32:03,143 --> 01:32:04,710
What a fuckin' circus.

1402
01:32:04,711 --> 01:32:08,179
And Paul in a fabulous suit by Givenchy.

1403
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:11,517
Next up, Queen Conga coming to the rescue

1404
01:32:11,518 --> 01:32:13,684
in her backpack day look.

1405
01:32:13,685 --> 01:32:16,021
Work the runway, mama.

1406
01:32:16,022 --> 01:32:20,826
<i>Little Lee Boy up in his Jimmy
Dean tres boy realness,</i>

1407
01:32:20,827 --> 01:32:23,027
and last, our Danny Boy,

1408
01:32:23,028 --> 01:32:28,733
straight off the runway from
the Ken Doll summer line.

1409
01:32:28,734 --> 01:32:32,704
Available only at Boy Toys "R" Us.

1410
01:32:37,477 --> 01:32:39,577
Looks like you're going down, Eddie.

1411
01:32:39,578 --> 01:32:42,014
I thought I told you to shut the fuck up.

1412
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:53,058
All right. Put 'em inside.

1413
01:32:53,059 --> 01:32:54,460
<i>Back up.</i>

1414
01:32:54,461 --> 01:32:57,562
<i>This is an unlawful assembly.
You will all be arrested.</i>

1415
01:32:57,563 --> 01:32:59,932
<i>Back up.</i>

1416
01:33:02,234 --> 01:33:04,202
<i>Go home.</i>

1417
01:33:04,203 --> 01:33:05,736
<i>If you stay here,
we're gonna arrest you.</i>

1418
01:33:05,737 --> 01:33:08,506
What's going on?

1419
01:33:08,507 --> 01:33:10,410
Another raid.

1420
01:33:16,683 --> 01:33:19,084
Who's the lucky lady?

1421
01:33:19,085 --> 01:33:20,819
<i>All, go home.</i>

1422
01:33:22,688 --> 01:33:24,755
Get your fuckin' hands off of me!

1423
01:33:24,756 --> 01:33:27,793
Fuck off! Fuck you!

1424
01:33:27,794 --> 01:33:29,827
No! Fuck off!

1425
01:33:29,828 --> 01:33:32,598
Fuck off! Don't touch me.

1426
01:33:32,599 --> 01:33:34,665
No! No!

1427
01:33:34,666 --> 01:33:36,768
Okay, okay.

1428
01:33:36,769 --> 01:33:38,504
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1429
01:33:38,505 --> 01:33:41,973
No! No! Get the fuck off!

1430
01:33:41,974 --> 01:33:45,710
Get your fuckin' hands off of me!

1431
01:33:45,711 --> 01:33:47,813
Hey, hey! Hey!

1432
01:33:49,014 --> 01:33:51,616
No, no! Fuck off!

1433
01:33:52,684 --> 01:33:54,986
Why are you all just standing there?

1434
01:33:54,987 --> 01:33:57,656
Fuckin' help me!

1435
01:34:01,861 --> 01:34:03,528
You follow me.

1436
01:34:03,529 --> 01:34:04,963
Get me out of here!

1437
01:34:04,964 --> 01:34:06,865
- Let's go.
- Get me out of here!

1438
01:34:06,866 --> 01:34:08,567
<i>All right, everybody. Back off.</i>

1439
01:34:08,568 --> 01:34:10,035
<i>Move away from the car.</i>

1440
01:34:11,970 --> 01:34:13,304
<i>- You will be arrested.
- Hey!</i>

1441
01:34:13,305 --> 01:34:15,107
Are you taking me on a date, Mr. Murphy?

1442
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:16,674
Taxi!

1443
01:34:16,675 --> 01:34:18,977
Hey, hey! Murphy's getting away!

1444
01:34:18,978 --> 01:34:21,614
<i>Get away from the car.</i>

1445
01:34:22,715 --> 01:34:25,017
Ray, Ray, Murphy's getting away!

1446
01:34:25,018 --> 01:34:26,585
Stop! Stop!

1447
01:34:26,586 --> 01:34:27,885
<i>Back off and get away</i>

1448
01:34:27,886 --> 01:34:29,153
<i>- from the car.
- Did you see that?</i>

1449
01:34:29,154 --> 01:34:30,555
Huh? Right there!

1450
01:34:30,556 --> 01:34:32,959
Why wouldn't you do anything?

1451
01:34:38,096 --> 01:34:39,564
What's going on out there?

1452
01:34:39,565 --> 01:34:41,933
Murphy got away.

1453
01:34:41,934 --> 01:34:42,802
We just took him out of here

1454
01:34:42,803 --> 01:34:44,135
and put him in a fuckin' paddy wagon.

1455
01:34:44,136 --> 01:34:45,870
- What happened?
- I guess you're right.

1456
01:34:45,871 --> 01:34:47,673
I guess he's got the 6th in their pocket.

1457
01:34:47,674 --> 01:34:49,141
You gotta take a look outside.

1458
01:34:49,142 --> 01:34:50,709
Every fag in New York is out there.

1459
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:53,010
Jesus fuckin' Christ!

1460
01:34:53,011 --> 01:34:55,714
Why won't you do anything?

1461
01:34:55,715 --> 01:34:58,717
You fucks!

1462
01:34:58,718 --> 01:35:02,321
Look at these asses.
They're all the fuckin' same.

1463
01:35:02,322 --> 01:35:03,688
Where did all these people come from?

1464
01:35:03,689 --> 01:35:04,656
I told you.

1465
01:35:04,657 --> 01:35:06,090
This is gonna get out of hand really fast.

1466
01:35:06,091 --> 01:35:08,226
You mean the 6th just fuckin' left?

1467
01:35:08,227 --> 01:35:09,327
I've had it with this bullshit!

1468
01:35:09,328 --> 01:35:10,928
Oh, no, no, no!

1469
01:35:10,929 --> 01:35:12,030
No, no! Cong, you're gonna make it worse.

1470
01:35:12,031 --> 01:35:13,130
How can it get worse?

1471
01:35:13,131 --> 01:35:14,299
Between the mob

1472
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:16,735
and those fuckin', money grabbing pigs,

1473
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:18,803
a society hating and oppressing us

1474
01:35:18,804 --> 01:35:22,240
for being gay, and you
still wanna be polite?

1475
01:35:22,241 --> 01:35:23,741
'Cause it's gonna take away your precious

1476
01:35:23,742 --> 01:35:25,876
fuckin' scholarship if you get arrested?

1477
01:35:25,877 --> 01:35:28,347
Come on!

1478
01:35:28,348 --> 01:35:31,616
Danny?

1479
01:35:31,617 --> 01:35:33,718
What are you doing?

1480
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:38,657
No. That's not the way, Danny.

1481
01:35:43,962 --> 01:35:46,999
No, Trevor. It's the only way!

1482
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,401
Gay power!

1483
01:35:49,402 --> 01:35:51,268
Come on!

1484
01:35:51,269 --> 01:35:53,237
Gay power!

1485
01:36:03,181 --> 01:36:05,617
Now, now. Hey, hey!

1486
01:36:10,023 --> 01:36:11,223
Everybody inside.

1487
01:36:11,224 --> 01:36:14,860
Inside! Back inside!

1488
01:36:21,099 --> 01:36:23,735
Welcome to the fuckin' club, man.

1489
01:36:23,736 --> 01:36:25,938
Gay power!

1490
01:36:27,907 --> 01:36:29,273
Hey!

1491
01:36:29,274 --> 01:36:32,077
Put that jukebox against the doors.

1492
01:36:36,983 --> 01:36:38,150
They cut the phone lines. Jack...

1493
01:36:38,151 --> 01:36:40,018
- Yeah.
- Radio.

1494
01:36:40,019 --> 01:36:41,085
This is Seymour Pine.

1495
01:36:41,086 --> 01:36:42,754
We have an emergency situation.

1496
01:36:42,755 --> 01:36:46,290
Do you copy? We
are 10-41, 10-41.

1497
01:36:46,291 --> 01:36:48,293
Do you copy?

1498
01:36:48,294 --> 01:36:49,760
Shit!

1499
01:36:49,761 --> 01:36:51,463
Okay. We need to find a way out of here.

1500
01:36:51,464 --> 01:36:53,432
Maybe in the back. Find a phone.

1501
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:56,300
Get us back up. Call TPF. Go!

1502
01:36:56,301 --> 01:36:58,003
All right. I need these kids over here.

1503
01:36:58,004 --> 01:36:59,303
Everybody in the back.

1504
01:37:02,774 --> 01:37:05,044
Over here.

1505
01:37:23,996 --> 01:37:25,998
Uh-oh.

1506
01:37:39,278 --> 01:37:41,681
Come on, girls, help me!

1507
01:37:47,319 --> 01:37:50,221
I got an idea. Come on, come on!

1508
01:37:52,425 --> 01:37:53,791
Hey!

1509
01:37:54,961 --> 01:37:57,495
Oh, yeah.

1510
01:37:57,496 --> 01:37:59,830
Sir, she got through the window.

1511
01:37:59,831 --> 01:38:00,932
TPF should be on the way.

1512
01:38:00,933 --> 01:38:02,500
Push!

1513
01:38:06,371 --> 01:38:10,142
Push that back! Keep that shut!

1514
01:38:17,082 --> 01:38:19,017
There will be no shooting
unless I shoot first.

1515
01:38:19,018 --> 01:38:20,951
You got it?

1516
01:38:20,952 --> 01:38:23,354
Oh, shit, there we go.

1517
01:38:26,224 --> 01:38:27,424
Let's go! Let's go!

1518
01:38:27,425 --> 01:38:29,161
Christ.

1519
01:38:29,162 --> 01:38:31,062
I hope they're not gonna burn
some old lady's house down.

1520
01:38:31,063 --> 01:38:32,830
That'll set us back years.

1521
01:38:32,831 --> 01:38:35,400
Would it, though? They're
not like us, Trevor.

1522
01:38:35,401 --> 01:38:38,203
These kids have nothing left to lose.

1523
01:38:41,206 --> 01:38:44,509
Let's organize a meeting for tomorrow.

1524
01:38:44,510 --> 01:38:47,079
Great idea.

1525
01:38:52,919 --> 01:38:55,320
Get away from the window! Jesus!

1526
01:38:55,321 --> 01:38:56,487
What the fuck?

1527
01:38:56,488 --> 01:38:59,424
It's like a campfire.

1528
01:38:59,425 --> 01:39:03,329
Look for a fire extinguisher! Fuck!

1529
01:39:04,529 --> 01:39:05,897
Keep the door shut!

1530
01:39:05,898 --> 01:39:07,598
There's people in here, you fucks!

1531
01:39:07,599 --> 01:39:09,334
This is not the way I was planning to die.

1532
01:39:09,335 --> 01:39:10,434
Can you imagine the headlines?

1533
01:39:10,435 --> 01:39:12,303
New York City cops killed by

1534
01:39:12,304 --> 01:39:13,938
a screaming mob of homosexuals.

1535
01:39:13,939 --> 01:39:15,907
Ha!

1536
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:35,528
Oh, shit!

1537
01:39:39,398 --> 01:39:42,334
<i>All right, people. Back up!</i>

1538
01:39:42,335 --> 01:39:44,335
<i>Drop your bricks and your
stones and your bottles,</i>

1539
01:39:44,336 --> 01:39:45,937

1540

1541
01:39:48,139 --> 01:39:51,042
<i>If you stay here,
we're gonna arrest you.</i>

1542
01:40:04,122 --> 01:40:05,389
Come on, pick something up.

1543
01:40:05,390 --> 01:40:07,393
Hey.

1544
01:40:13,965 --> 01:40:16,968
Danny! Girls, girls! Line up!

1545
01:40:16,969 --> 01:40:18,402
Line up, girls, come on! Come on!

1546
01:40:18,403 --> 01:40:23,407
Come on, line up! One, two, three.

1547
01:40:23,408 --> 01:40:25,309

1565

Go, go, go. Let's get the fuck out of here!

1566
01:41:39,484 --> 01:41:41,052
We okay?

1567
01:41:41,053 --> 01:41:43,554
Yeah, we're okay.

1568
01:41:45,157 --> 01:41:47,159
Open that.

1569
01:41:51,363 --> 01:41:53,630
Where the fuck have you guys been?

1570
01:41:57,236 --> 01:42:00,005
Hey, you wait here.

1571
01:42:03,541 --> 01:42:07,077
Auntie, darling, I need your help.

1572
01:42:13,219 --> 01:42:15,586
Thank you very much.

1573
01:42:15,587 --> 01:42:19,023
You know what, Mr. Murphy? You're done.

1574
01:42:20,725 --> 01:42:23,027
You think?

1575
01:42:23,028 --> 01:42:25,330
One night of faggy temper
tantrums in the Village

1576
01:42:25,331 --> 01:42:27,197
changes anything?

1577
01:42:27,198 --> 01:42:31,335
I can't wait to watch you
figure it all out, honey.

1578
01:42:31,336 --> 01:42:33,638
Just don't call me honey, you freak.

1579
01:42:53,792 --> 01:42:55,995
Come on!

1580
01:43:00,433 --> 01:43:01,532
Whoo!

1581
01:43:04,403 --> 01:43:06,403
Fuck you!

1582
01:43:06,404 --> 01:43:08,606
Oh, shit!

1583
01:43:08,607 --> 01:43:10,642
Ray!

01:43:11,676 --> 01:43:13,277
Ray! Ray!

1585
01:43:13,278 --> 01:43:17,781
You fuckin' pigs! You fuckin' pigs!

We've got our civil rights!

Come on! Run, you fuckin' pigs!

1589
01:44:03,729 --> 01:44:05,796
Why don't you start by handing them out?

1590
01:44:05,797 --> 01:44:07,464
Okay.

1591
01:44:07,465 --> 01:44:09,468
Thanks.

1592
01:44:23,882 --> 01:44:26,417
Here you go.

1593
01:44:29,621 --> 01:44:33,424
"If you are..."

1594
01:44:33,425 --> 01:44:36,427
"Do you think homosexuals are revolting?"

1595
01:44:36,428 --> 01:44:38,162
You bet your sweet ass we are!

1596
01:44:38,163 --> 01:44:39,930
Guess who wrote this piece of shit?

1597
01:44:39,931 --> 01:44:41,699
- Oh.
- Mmm-hmm.

1598
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:43,500
Danny's man Trevor.

1599
01:44:43,501 --> 01:44:44,768
We out fighting,

1600
01:44:44,769 --> 01:44:46,905
and this motherfucker's home making flyers.

1601
01:44:46,906 --> 01:44:49,907
Oh, Mary, he's called for a meeting.

1602
01:44:49,908 --> 01:44:52,410
Ooh! Free sandwiches.

1603
01:44:52,411 --> 01:44:54,178
He's a brave man, your boyfriend.

1604
01:44:54,179 --> 01:44:56,781
Yeah, well, he's not my boyfriend.

1605
01:44:56,782 --> 01:44:58,183
God!

1606
01:44:58,184 --> 01:44:59,450
Ooh, the attitude.

1607
01:44:59,451 --> 01:45:02,920
Wait! I'm sorry. Look, I'm sorry!

1608
01:45:02,921 --> 01:45:05,790
No, you're right. He's all
talk, and talk is cheap.

1609
01:45:05,791 --> 01:45:07,625
You know, maybe you'll
figure that out one day.

1610
01:45:07,626 --> 01:45:09,626
Danny, don't go. Where you going?

1611
01:45:09,627 --> 01:45:12,196
I don't know, Ray!

1612
01:45:12,197 --> 01:45:15,967
Danny. I guess everything is different now.

1613
01:45:15,968 --> 01:45:18,469
Things are changing, like...

1614
01:45:18,470 --> 01:45:20,871
We could really get a place, you know.

1615
01:45:20,872 --> 01:45:24,308
I could get a real job. Screw this!

1616
01:45:24,309 --> 01:45:27,478
Ray, come on.

1617
01:45:27,479 --> 01:45:29,479
Don't you understand?

1618
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:33,985
No. I mean, what am I
supposed to understand?

1619
01:45:33,986 --> 01:45:36,555
That I can't love you.

1620
01:45:37,989 --> 01:45:40,724
You and me...

1621
01:45:40,725 --> 01:45:43,494
I mean, different isn't even the word.

1622
01:45:43,495 --> 01:45:45,295
Danny, you don't think I know that?

1623
01:45:45,296 --> 01:45:47,464
I know.

1624
01:45:47,465 --> 01:45:53,004
I'm sorry, but I'm too mad
to love anyone right now.

1625
01:45:53,005 --> 01:45:54,371
This...

1626
01:45:54,372 --> 01:45:56,974
All this is so new to me,

1627
01:45:56,975 --> 01:45:59,244
but, you know, I like being mad!

1628
01:45:59,245 --> 01:46:00,777
I like not being the nice kid.

1629
01:46:00,778 --> 01:46:03,313
And last night felt so good.

1630
01:46:03,314 --> 01:46:04,415
You're always gonna be the nice kid,

1631
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:06,617
you know that, right?

1632
01:46:06,618 --> 01:46:08,786
You can't help it.

1633
01:46:10,389 --> 01:46:12,591
Fuck you.

1634
01:46:16,394 --> 01:46:18,830
Thank you for showing me New York.

1635
01:46:26,505 --> 01:46:28,806
You'll always be my sister.

1636
01:46:31,376 --> 01:46:36,380
Yeah. My brick throwing sister.

1637
01:46:36,381 --> 01:46:38,549
I didn't know they made
farm boys from Kansas

1638
01:46:38,550 --> 01:46:40,852
that could throw like that.

1639
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:46,625
Yeah, right. In Kansas.

1640
01:46:49,995 --> 01:46:53,532
I'll see you around, Ray.

1641
01:47:36,407 --> 01:47:38,710
Hi, Sarah.

1642
01:47:38,711 --> 01:47:40,745
Is Joe home?

1643
01:47:40,746 --> 01:47:42,948
Danny...

1644
01:47:45,384 --> 01:47:48,386
Why don't you come
inside? He's in the garage.

1645
01:47:58,596 --> 01:48:01,098
Hi, Mrs. Altman.

1646
01:48:01,099 --> 01:48:03,035
Hello, Danny.

1647
01:48:08,407 --> 01:48:10,809
Joe's outside.

1648
01:48:43,408 --> 01:48:44,842
How's New York treating you?

1649
01:48:44,843 --> 01:48:47,711
It's good. It's weird.

1650
01:48:50,748 --> 01:48:53,085
I just finished my first year at Columbia.

1651
01:48:54,586 --> 01:48:56,855
That's what you always wanted.

1652
01:48:58,489 --> 01:49:00,524
Yeah, I guess.

1653
01:49:05,596 --> 01:49:07,532
Why'd you come here, Danny?

1654
01:49:15,541 --> 01:49:18,377
'Cause I just wanted you to know that

1655
01:49:20,813 --> 01:49:22,781
I really did love you.

1656
01:49:25,017 --> 01:49:27,051
Maybe I still do.

1657
01:49:28,554 --> 01:49:30,589
Danny.

1658
01:49:34,492 --> 01:49:36,560
I'm married.

1659
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:39,162
Yeah.

1660
01:49:39,163 --> 01:49:42,000
I'm gonna have a baby.

1661
01:49:46,804 --> 01:49:51,709
I don't know what it was, what we had.

1662
01:49:52,743 --> 01:49:55,580
Maybe it was kind of like love.

1663
01:49:59,484 --> 01:50:01,987
Danny, whatever we...

1664
01:50:03,721 --> 01:50:05,623
I'm not like you.

1665
01:50:10,962 --> 01:50:15,032
If I'd known you'd hold
onto it like this, I...

1666
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:24,475
I just think you should leave.

1667
01:50:30,948 --> 01:50:33,217
Okay.

1668
01:50:33,218 --> 01:50:35,086
Okay.

1669
01:50:38,991 --> 01:50:41,926
I'm sorry, Danny.

1670
01:51:34,580 --> 01:51:36,046
How's the book, Phebes?

1671
01:51:36,047 --> 01:51:38,116
- Danny!
- Hey.

1672
01:51:40,051 --> 01:51:41,184
I've missed you!

1673
01:51:41,185 --> 01:51:43,888
Wait!

1674
01:51:43,889 --> 01:51:46,691
If you didn't bring me
Andy Warhol's autograph,

1675
01:51:46,692 --> 01:51:47,692
you can just leave right now.

1676
01:51:47,693 --> 01:51:49,326
Oh, really?

1677
01:51:49,327 --> 01:51:51,696
What is it with you and Andy Warhol, huh?

1678
01:51:51,697 --> 01:51:52,796
What is it?

1679
01:51:56,068 --> 01:51:58,570
He's the opposite of this.

1680
01:51:59,871 --> 01:52:01,772
Hello, Danny.

1681
01:52:01,773 --> 01:52:05,110
I thought you and your
sister might be thirsty.

1682
01:52:07,912 --> 01:52:10,147
Thanks, Mom.

1683
01:52:14,019 --> 01:52:16,086
And thank you for sending in my papers.

1684
01:52:16,087 --> 01:52:18,923
I never would have got my
scholarship without them.

1685
01:52:18,924 --> 01:52:21,726
Thank you for writing.

1686
01:52:21,727 --> 01:52:23,760
Are you happy?

1687
01:52:23,761 --> 01:52:26,229
More than I was.

1688
01:52:26,230 --> 01:52:30,067
Well. Okay.

1689
01:52:30,068 --> 01:52:34,573
I'll leave you to be with Phoebe.

1690
01:52:40,245 --> 01:52:41,411
I don't go to church with them anymore.

1691
01:52:41,412 --> 01:52:43,179
No?

1692
01:52:43,180 --> 01:52:44,381
You got me out of that.

1693
01:52:44,382 --> 01:52:45,715
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1694
01:52:45,716 --> 01:52:47,751
How's that?

1695
01:52:47,752 --> 01:52:50,787
Well, I told them that their behavior

1696
01:52:50,788 --> 01:52:53,790
was not at all Christian towards you,

1697
01:52:53,791 --> 01:52:56,026
and that I was disappointed with them.

1698
01:52:58,729 --> 01:53:00,697
They're doing the best they can.

1699
01:53:00,698 --> 01:53:03,933
That's what they say about
anyone who's not good enough.

1700
01:53:03,934 --> 01:53:06,170
So...

1701
01:53:09,675 --> 01:53:10,941
So?

1702
01:53:10,942 --> 01:53:12,276
Do you have a boyfriend?

1703
01:53:12,277 --> 01:53:13,911
No.

1704
01:53:13,912 --> 01:53:16,280
I'm just asking.

1705
01:53:16,281 --> 01:53:21,018
But I do have friends. Good friends.

1706
01:53:21,019 --> 01:53:24,455
Wayne Mortal in my class is gay.

1707
01:53:24,456 --> 01:53:25,955
He told me.

1708
01:53:25,956 --> 01:53:31,128
And only me because he knows all about you.

1709
01:53:31,129 --> 01:53:33,798
Oh, yeah?

1710
01:53:33,799 --> 01:53:35,800
So I'm famous now.

1711
01:53:37,868 --> 01:53:40,870
Why'd you come back, Danny?

1712
01:53:40,871 --> 01:53:43,807
I had some unfinished business, I guess.

1713
01:53:45,010 --> 01:53:45,875
And to see you, stupid.

1714
01:53:47,211 --> 01:53:50,214
Why else would I come back? Huh?

1715
01:53:50,215 --> 01:53:53,884
Hey, so we're having a
parade in Manhattan next month

1716
01:53:53,885 --> 01:53:56,454
to commemorate the fighting.

1717
01:53:56,455 --> 01:54:00,290
We're gonna go all the way
uptown from the Village,

1718
01:54:00,291 --> 01:54:02,893
right up to Central Park,

1719
01:54:02,894 --> 01:54:07,031
and they're gonna call it
the Gay Liberation March.

1720
01:54:07,032 --> 01:54:11,335
Okay. I'm coming.

1721
01:54:11,336 --> 01:54:13,972
I'll take the train.

1722
01:54:16,308 --> 01:54:18,509
You know they're not
gonna let you go, right?

1723
01:54:18,510 --> 01:54:22,245
I know they won't.
They're trying not to make

1724
01:54:22,246 --> 01:54:26,317
the same mistakes with
me as they made with you.

1725
01:54:26,318 --> 01:54:28,786
Hey, hey.

1726
01:54:32,491 --> 01:54:35,025
I have to go, Phebes.

1727
01:54:35,026 --> 01:54:36,994
I can't miss my bus.

1728
01:54:36,995 --> 01:54:38,962
I love you.

1729
01:54:44,301 --> 01:54:48,238
Say hi to your friends for me. Okay?

1730
01:56:24,269 --> 01:56:27,004
If that isn't Danny Winters.

1731
01:56:27,005 --> 01:56:29,138
Well, hey, sister!

1732
01:56:30,507 --> 01:56:31,442
You know you can bring

1733
01:56:31,443 --> 01:56:33,076
your country ass downtown
more often, right?

1734
01:56:33,077 --> 01:56:34,445
Yeah, I know.

1735
01:56:34,446 --> 01:56:37,046
Look what I found!

1736
01:56:37,047 --> 01:56:40,017
Well, look who it is. How're you doing?

1737
01:56:40,018 --> 01:56:41,352
And how are you doing, huh?

1738
01:56:41,353 --> 01:56:43,053
- Same old, same old.
- Yeah?

1739
01:56:43,054 --> 01:56:44,354
Well, you got yourself some new clothes,

1740
01:56:44,355 --> 01:56:46,122
so it can't be all that bad.

1741
01:56:46,123 --> 01:56:49,293
Well, we had to dress up
'cause today's a special day.

1742
01:56:49,294 --> 01:56:50,326
How's school, Columbia?

1743
01:56:50,327 --> 01:56:51,527
It's great.

1744
01:56:51,528 --> 01:56:53,997
It's really great.

1745
01:56:53,998 --> 01:56:55,232
All right, people.

1746
01:56:55,233 --> 01:56:56,567
Let's get the show on the road.

1747
01:56:56,568 --> 01:56:58,902
Okay, bitches, you heard the man.

1748
01:56:58,903 --> 01:57:01,170
Let's face New York fuckin' City.

1749
01:57:05,076 --> 01:57:06,643
Out of the closet. In the street.

1750
01:57:06,644 --> 01:57:09,178
