THE CHORONA

52
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:19,124
CHORONA
(still untitled in Brazil)

53
00:03:26,003 --> 00:03:27,380
No medals.

54
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,169
Dark suits, but not black.

55
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,775
Matt color, without shine.

56
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:34,002
Clean white shirts.

57
00:03:34,003 --> 00:03:35,899
The tie in a double windsor.

58
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:38,399
They need to be spotless.

59
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,525
Remember that they are
heroes, not victims.

60
00:03:43,012 --> 00:03:46,200
And in no way lower your head.

61
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:54,397
If the general falls,
he'll drag us along.

62
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,119
And at our age,

63
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,991
any sentence means perpetual.

64
00:04:02,795 --> 00:04:04,698
They have become
cowards over the years.

65
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,295
It was a pleasure.

66
00:04:23,337 --> 00:04:24,637
Thanks for everything.

67
00:04:24,638 --> 00:04:25,938
Thank you for coming.

68
00:04:31,545 --> 00:04:32,920
Thank you for coming.

69
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:00,722
- Do you want to sleep here with me?
- No, very hot.

70
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,878
Why do you speak ill of grandpa?

71
00:05:23,212 --> 00:05:26,837
- Do your friends speak ill of him?
- No, on the internet.

72
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:39,501
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

73
00:05:39,502 --> 00:05:42,107
<i>Grandparents, ancestral spirits,</i>

74
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,906
<i>accept this light
as an offering.</i>

75
00:05:45,907 --> 00:05:48,102
<i>We pray for Don Enrique,</i>

76
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:51,502
<i>your family and this house.</i>

77
00:05:51,503 --> 00:05:54,310
<i>We offer this light
so that all evil</i>

78
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:56,908
<i>leave this place</i>

79
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:59,610
<i>and that everything gets right.</i>

80
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:02,794
<i>We ask for protection
from our loved ones.</i>

81
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,786
<i>We offer this light, we pray</i>

82
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:09,000
<i>and we ask with all our hearts.</i>

83
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,711
<i>Letona!</i>

84
00:11:04,712 --> 00:11:08,514
- Don Enrique, it's me, Valeriana.
- <i> Letona!</i>

85
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:10,830
Valerian, take his gun.

86
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:13,500
<i>- Enrique.</i> - Give me the gun.

87
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:17,086
You heard that woman cry too.

88
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:19,814
You heard her cry too.

89
00:11:19,815 --> 00:11:21,493
Give me the pistol.

90
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:24,086
Sir, release it. It's Valerian.

91
00:11:24,087 --> 00:11:25,796
Search the rooms.

92
00:11:26,795 --> 00:11:29,127
The guerrillas
planted a spy here.

93
00:11:29,128 --> 00:11:31,712
- Okay, but let go.
- This is an order!

94
00:11:35,812 --> 00:11:37,518
Did anyone hear a woman cry?

95
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:41,678
Are you sure?

96
00:11:46,253 --> 00:11:48,085
It was a nightmare, that's all.

97
00:11:49,003 --> 00:11:51,705
Someone entered the house.
I heard it.

98
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:00,373
<i>It was Chorona.</i>

99
00:12:02,378 --> 00:12:05,462
<i>Did he hear you
from far or near?</i>

100
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:07,503
<i>In the ear.</i>

101
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:10,670
<i>So she is far away.</i>

102
00:12:11,503 --> 00:12:12,803
<i>Quiet!</i>

103
00:12:13,295 --> 00:12:15,871
- What did you say? - Nothing.

104
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:20,127
He's getting older,
that's what is happening.

105
00:12:23,753 --> 00:12:25,197
Pass me the pistol.

106
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,161
For the safety of
all, I will guard it.

107
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:45,682
We need to call a carpenter.

108
00:12:47,003 --> 00:12:50,293
Your poor father.
It is not for less.

109
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:54,014
With everything they do to
him it's normal to go crazy.

110
00:12:54,962 --> 00:12:57,193
Stress accelerates Alzheimer's.

111
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,627
He still has good aim.
That was close.

112
00:13:01,628 --> 00:13:03,103
You could have killed me.

113
00:13:05,006 --> 00:13:06,920
After the verdict
he will get better.

114
00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:16,087
MS. Carmen,
the employees want to leave.

115
00:13:18,337 --> 00:13:19,855
Valerian, please

116
00:13:19,856 --> 00:13:22,602
tell me now is a bad time.

117
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:24,581
My mom needs help with my dad.

118
00:13:24,582 --> 00:13:26,244
See how the poor fellow is doing.

119
00:13:26,628 --> 00:13:28,196
You can't leave her alone.

120
00:13:29,962 --> 00:13:33,002
My parents provided a
house, food, a good salary

121
00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:34,915
and treat you like family.

122
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,891
They even buy your tortillas.

123
00:13:37,712 --> 00:13:40,412
Nowhere else will they
be treated like this.

124
00:13:41,212 --> 00:13:44,758
Reconsider, please.
This is a delicate moment.

125
00:13:45,462 --> 00:13:46,941
Everyone is afraid.

126
00:13:47,253 --> 00:13:49,257
They are ungrateful.

127
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:59,336
Latvia, get the car ready, please.
Otherwise, it will be late.

128
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:00,753
<i>All set, lady.</i>

129
00:14:04,337 --> 00:14:08,628
MS. Carmen, before they go,
they want to receive the salary.

130
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,598
Nowhere else will you find work.

131
00:14:17,628 --> 00:14:19,092
Is Enrique ready?

132
00:14:57,902 --> 00:14:59,785
<i>The guerrilla ran away</i>

133
00:14:59,786 --> 00:15:02,615
<i>when I heard that the
army was approaching.</i>

134
00:15:03,295 --> 00:15:05,011
<i>I didn't even notice.</i>

135
00:15:05,012 --> 00:15:08,176
<i>When I saw the fire,
I grabbed my kids and ran.</i>

136
00:15:17,337 --> 00:15:19,846
<i>The violence came suddenly.</i>

137
00:15:44,803 --> 00:15:47,297
<i>First they burned the fields,</i>

138
00:15:47,298 --> 00:15:50,903
<i>then the houses,
our clothes and animals.</i>

139
00:15:51,503 --> 00:15:54,116
<i>In addition,
they separated women and children</i>

140
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:55,809
<i>of the men left over.</i>

141
00:16:07,712 --> 00:16:09,418
<i>We women were raped.</i>

142
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,837
<i>And then the massacres started.</i>

143
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,720
<i>Silence.</i>

144
00:16:50,202 --> 00:16:52,670
Some of us managed to
escape to the mountains.

145
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:56,512
Up there,
we'll be protected by the clouds

146
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:59,110
when the helicopters
came looking for us.

147
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:02,459
Since there was no food,
we need to go down.

148
00:17:02,878 --> 00:17:05,988
That was when I was arrested
and taken to the military camp.

149
00:17:23,012 --> 00:17:26,211
There the soldiers did
what they wanted with me.

150
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,128
I was not the only one.

151
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:42,092
We hadn't done anything.
We are only going to our homes.

152
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:09,421
I'm not ashamed to tell
you what I went through.

153
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,038
I hope you are not
ashamed to do justice.

154
00:18:16,837 --> 00:18:18,409
That is all, very merit.

155
00:18:19,628 --> 00:18:21,420
<i>Thank you, Witness 82.</i>

156
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:29,287
<i>The process has already taken two months.</i>

157
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:32,045
<i>General Monteverde guarantees
that in his mandate</i>

158
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:35,378
<i>guerrillas were made up
of entire communities.</i>

159
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:37,753
<i>They were all part of the revolt.</i>

160
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:40,470
<i>According to the defense,
no civilians were killed,</i>

161
00:18:40,471 --> 00:18:42,295
<i>only armed guerrillas.</i>

162
00:18:42,296 --> 00:18:46,378
<i>The general insists that
there was no genocide.</i>

163
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:49,420
<i>But according to the victims
he perpetrated genocide.</i>

164
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:50,670
Madam, your tea.

165
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:55,628
<i>They remember that
between 1982 and 1983</i>

166
00:18:55,629 --> 00:19:01,378
<i>the armed forces murdered an
average of 3,000 people a month.</i>

167
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:05,462
<i>Equivalent to 33% of
the Maia Ixil people.</i>

168
00:19:05,463 --> 00:19:09,253
<i>According to the Prosecutor's Office,
the military wanted to exterminate them</i>

169
00:19:09,254 --> 00:19:13,712
<i>to occupy its oil-rich lands
in the north of the country.</i>

170
00:19:13,713 --> 00:19:15,143
Let's go back?

171
00:19:15,144 --> 00:19:17,878
<i>In several interviews,
the general said that...</i>

172
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:22,420
<i>people are to the guerrillas
what water is to fish.</i>

173
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:27,295
<i>If you want to end the fish,
you need to end the water first.</i>

174
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,298
Internationally,
he is known as one of the dictators

175
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:34,183
most bloodthirsty
in Latin America.

176
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:36,670
Mr. Monteverde, a word please.

177
00:19:37,795 --> 00:19:40,462
General Enrique Monteverde

178
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:45,337
never affirmed, never proposed,

179
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:48,795
never ordered the
Guatemalan army

180
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:52,503
attempt against any
race, any ethnicity

181
00:19:53,045 --> 00:19:55,253
or no religion.

182
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:59,587
That is why in Guatemala
there was no genocide.

183
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,920
I give the floor to the Hon.
general Enrique Monteverde.

184
00:20:07,212 --> 00:20:08,753
Your Honor,

185
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:13,378
I know that this process
is very important.

186
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:17,337
And that Guatemala
deserves respect.

187
00:20:17,338 --> 00:20:19,545
But you know well

188
00:20:19,546 --> 00:20:23,920
that my intention was to
create a national identity...

189
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:26,003
<i>Genocide!</i>

190
00:20:26,004 --> 00:20:27,878
<i>Please silence.</i>

191
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:31,920
I declare myself innocent.

192
00:20:32,962 --> 00:20:35,503
I don't know what
I'm being accused of.

193
00:20:35,504 --> 00:20:40,462
The Public Ministry presented
evidence, testimonies, expertise

194
00:20:40,463 --> 00:20:45,420
and official military documents
in which it is considered

195
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:49,920
the entire Mayan Ixil people
as enemies of the state.

196
00:20:51,062 --> 00:20:54,978
38% of the victims were children

197
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:57,679
under 12 years old.

198
00:20:58,128 --> 00:21:02,587
This damage done goes beyond
all human understanding.

199
00:21:02,588 --> 00:21:08,567
There was profound damage not only to
the direct victims of the massacres

200
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,295
as with all Guatemalan
social fabric.

201
00:21:15,128 --> 00:21:20,503
Telling the truth helps to
heal the wounds of the past.

202
00:21:20,504 --> 00:21:22,003
Whereas...

203
00:21:22,004 --> 00:21:27,253
General Enrique Monteverde
was aware of the massacres

204
00:21:27,254 --> 00:21:29,837
occurred under his command

205
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:35,587
and did nothing to stop them,
despite having the power to do so

206
00:21:35,588 --> 00:21:37,920
is declared

207
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,217
guilty of genocide.

208
00:22:02,837 --> 00:22:04,212
<i>Excuse me!</i>

209
00:22:07,045 --> 00:22:08,587
Take him to the hospital.

210
00:22:13,503 --> 00:22:14,920
You need to go to the hospital.

211
00:22:26,753 --> 00:22:31,087
<i>Know that there are more
than 1,500 cases of people</i>

212
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:36,837
<i>willing to give false testimony
in exchange for money.</i>

213
00:22:36,838 --> 00:22:39,920
<i>And where do you think
that money comes from?</i>

214
00:22:40,337 --> 00:22:41,795
<i>Of the people.</i>

215
00:22:43,545 --> 00:22:45,587
<i>What do you think of the judges' actions?</i>

216
00:22:45,588 --> 00:22:50,795
<i>The judge is a criminal.
I want to see you behind bars.</i>

217
00:22:51,795 --> 00:22:55,785
- I need to take out the cigarette, sir.
<i>- That judge should be arrested.</i>

218
00:23:01,795 --> 00:23:03,628
One thing is right.

219
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:07,420
Heaven sent an angel
to look after me.

220
00:23:08,628 --> 00:23:09,928
Thanks.

221
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,378
Did my father tell you everything?

222
00:23:26,295 --> 00:23:30,462
Do you think he did all those things
or did he just give the orders?

223
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:36,503
Do you believe these prostitutes
more than your own father?

224
00:23:36,504 --> 00:23:38,587
What prostitutes?

225
00:23:38,588 --> 00:23:42,670
Those days that you
testified in court.

226
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:46,003
They're whores paid to lie.

227
00:23:46,587 --> 00:23:47,920
Oh, mother.

228
00:23:48,503 --> 00:23:51,837
I don't believe you are
able to invent these things.

229
00:23:51,838 --> 00:23:54,920
They would have to live
to tell them like that.

230
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,837
Because your father said they
showed up at the barracks.

231
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,420
Some even breastfeeding.

232
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:06,878
The benevolent generals
offered cleaning jobs.

233
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:11,378
But the low-ranking soldiers
used them as whores.

234
00:24:13,587 --> 00:24:17,837
I remember that when Dad went to
the barracks, you always fought.

235
00:24:17,838 --> 00:24:21,545
You cried because
he had other women.

236
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,220
Yes.

237
00:24:25,962 --> 00:24:29,128
Even though they are
generals, they are men.

238
00:24:30,128 --> 00:24:33,462
Furthermore,
they came to seduce them.

239
00:24:35,587 --> 00:24:39,420
I don't mean just that,
but everything else.

240
00:24:41,878 --> 00:24:44,128
Which side are you on?

241
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:47,769
Won't you say you believe
all these communists?

242
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,033
Do not mix things up.

243
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,628
Since when did you become a leftist?

244
00:24:58,628 --> 00:25:01,253
Who you're walking with, count.

245
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:04,481
They already convinced you, you know?

246
00:25:05,878 --> 00:25:08,795
I want to know if
you were aware.

247
00:25:13,878 --> 00:25:18,087
For the country to advance,
it is necessary to go ahead.

248
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:24,045
What is left behind is behind.

249
00:25:24,837 --> 00:25:28,878
And if we look back,
we become statues of salt.

250
00:25:35,878 --> 00:25:39,503
I already know what you are thinking
and forbid you to think that.

251
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:47,503
<i>We are in the military hospital</i>

252
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:51,753
<i>where General Monteverde has
been in custody for 8 days.</i>

253
00:25:51,754 --> 00:25:56,712
<i>The Supreme Court overturned the
verdict against the former dictator.</i>

254
00:25:56,713 --> 00:26:01,212
<i>Representatives of the private
sector approved the court's decision,</i>

255
00:26:01,213 --> 00:26:05,295
<i>claiming there is no
evidence of genocide.</i>

256
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,712
<i>General Monteverde must be
released this afternoon.</i>

257
00:26:18,713 --> 00:26:23,045
<i>The international community
reacted negatively to the news</i>

258
00:26:23,046 --> 00:26:26,712
<i>highlighting the problems of
corruption and impunity in the country.</i>

259
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:29,712
Give me 5 minutes with the
doctor, wait.

260
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:32,753
Not now, maybe later.
Don't let it in.

261
00:26:32,754 --> 00:26:35,087
You promised me an interview.

262
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:38,907
Dr. Monteverde,
can we talk about your daughter's father?

263
00:26:38,908 --> 00:26:42,243
Since when did he disappear?
What do you know about him?

264
00:26:42,244 --> 00:26:45,587
Do not meddle in this.
And be careful, understand?

265
00:27:07,852 --> 00:27:09,729
250 meters to go.

266
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,269
Sir,
please give me the cigarette.

267
00:27:14,747 --> 00:27:16,951
Your bulletproof vest.

268
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:27,770
Do not talk to the press.
Let's go straight in, please.

269
00:27:29,962 --> 00:27:32,936
- One hundred meters.
- We're ready, sir.

270
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:38,483
- Stay tuned, Garcia. - Yes sir.

271
00:27:41,565 --> 00:27:43,010
Fifty meters.

272
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,503
Everything is under control.
Don't worry.

273
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:53,021
Stay tuned.
At my signal, get out.

274
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,826
Understood?

275
00:27:55,827 --> 00:27:59,420
Don't panic.
It is a peaceful demonstration.

276
00:28:01,862 --> 00:28:03,716
How did you let so
many people pass by?

277
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:05,295
We have to make way.

278
00:28:07,198 --> 00:28:09,472
What story is this?
Ask for reinforcement!

279
00:28:09,918 --> 00:28:13,176
Go ahead.
We still want to go further.

280
00:28:16,503 --> 00:28:18,423
We're going out.

281
00:28:18,969 --> 00:28:20,422
Release the entry.

282
00:28:20,423 --> 00:28:23,117
- This is not peaceful, sir.
- We have to leave.

283
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,628
One two Three.
Garcia, open the door now!

284
00:28:27,954 --> 00:28:31,688
Get out!  Come on, get out!

285
00:28:31,689 --> 00:28:33,595
Get out! Everything is fine!
Get out!

286
00:28:38,521 --> 00:28:40,188
Pass! Pass! Pass it on!

287
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,149
GO!  Let us through!

288
00:28:58,483 --> 00:29:00,212
Go up, go up!

289
00:29:00,213 --> 00:29:02,116
Watch out, lady!

290
00:29:05,068 --> 00:29:08,302
Get up!  Get up!

291
00:29:15,792 --> 00:29:18,825
We made it inside. Are you okay?

292
00:29:18,826 --> 00:29:20,183
What's your name?

293
00:29:20,184 --> 00:29:21,484
<i>- There.</i> - Letona!

294
00:29:21,485 --> 00:29:22,785
Please.

295
00:29:22,786 --> 00:29:25,030
- Letona! - They didn't steal
anything from me, did they?

296
00:29:25,031 --> 00:29:26,603
What I need is to be alone.

297
00:29:26,604 --> 00:29:28,003
It was horrible.

298
00:29:28,004 --> 00:29:30,087
A bunch of savages.

299
00:29:32,186 --> 00:29:34,545
Tell Dora to prepare me a bath.

300
00:29:34,546 --> 00:29:37,003
- Dora left. - So, Delia.

301
00:29:37,004 --> 00:29:39,295
- Everyone left.
- Are they all gone?

302
00:29:39,296 --> 00:29:42,826
Bunch of ungrateful. After...

303
00:29:43,255 --> 00:29:47,087
You need to call the agency
so they can send someone.

304
00:29:47,088 --> 00:29:49,098
There are a lot of
people who want to work.

305
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:51,091
Someone to call urgently, right?

306
00:29:51,092 --> 00:29:53,872
<i>- I already called.</i>
- Doctor, are you all right?

307
00:29:53,873 --> 00:29:55,489
I am, leave us alone.

308
00:29:55,797 --> 00:29:57,880
And make these people shut up.

309
00:30:00,003 --> 00:30:01,503
Mother, what did they do?

310
00:30:01,504 --> 00:30:03,799
- You got dirty.
- Did they hurt you?

311
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,045
- No, it's not my blood
- Whose is it?

312
00:30:07,046 --> 00:30:09,878
I think it's a cow.
Do not be afraid.

313
00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:12,087
Do not be afraid.
Everything is fine. I'm here.

314
00:30:12,088 --> 00:30:14,712
Mother, I want to go.
I don't want to stay here.

315
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:18,670
- Let's go home.
- I'm here. Do not be afraid.

316
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:20,299
I want to go.

317
00:30:55,274 --> 00:30:57,649
Have you been there a long time?

318
00:30:58,032 --> 00:30:59,641
Yes, general.

319
00:31:03,227 --> 00:31:05,295
Did you hear someone cry?

320
00:31:07,107 --> 00:31:08,529
No.

321
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,128
<i>Killer!</i>

322
00:31:23,657 --> 00:31:25,615
Do not expose yourself, please.

323
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:36,081
To the guide, Lobo no 12.

324
00:31:36,082 --> 00:31:38,089
Check perimeter four.

325
00:31:39,104 --> 00:31:43,378
<i>We want justice!
We want justice!</i>

326
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:48,781
<i>Killer!  Killer!</i>

327
00:31:49,954 --> 00:31:52,954
<i>We want justice!
We want justice!</i>

328
00:32:31,236 --> 00:32:34,232
<i>- Good Morning. - Are you alone?</i>

329
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,107
<i>Where are the others?</i>

330
00:32:36,493 --> 00:32:38,302
<i>They are afraid.</i>

331
00:32:38,716 --> 00:32:41,342
<i>There is a lot of work
for you to do on your own.</i>

332
00:32:41,343 --> 00:32:44,212
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- The new employee.

333
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:46,612
<i>Come in and close the door.</i>

334
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:49,655
<i>They could, but they cannot open
that door without authorization.</i>

335
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,392
<i>- Is she released? - Yes sir.</i>

336
00:32:52,393 --> 00:32:54,337
Enter and wait.

337
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:06,831
Stay here, please.

338
00:33:08,651 --> 00:33:10,250
Open your arms.

339
00:33:17,165 --> 00:33:18,498
Turn around.

340
00:33:22,893 --> 00:33:24,603
I need to check your bag.

341
00:33:36,427 --> 00:33:39,253
- It's cleared.
- Can I wear long hair?

342
00:33:39,564 --> 00:33:42,377
- You can, dear.
- I want a dress like hers.

343
00:33:46,253 --> 00:33:47,948
<i>I want to show the house.</i>

344
00:33:48,268 --> 00:33:50,860
<i>It's better tomorrow.
She must be tired.</i>

345
00:33:52,212 --> 00:33:55,056
<i>I've been working in this house for 27 years.</i>

346
00:33:56,545 --> 00:33:59,045
<i>The food stays here.</i>

347
00:33:59,046 --> 00:34:01,243
<i>This drawer is yours.</i>

348
00:34:02,086 --> 00:34:04,672
<i>Don't worry.
They buy everything for us.</i>

349
00:34:16,196 --> 00:34:18,321
<i>Our rooms are there.</i>

350
00:34:20,854 --> 00:34:25,979
<i>This is the laundry.
Here is the ironing board.</i>

351
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:34,153
<i>The house is very big.</i>

352
00:34:34,154 --> 00:34:37,301
<i>Sometimes it seems
to be haunted.</i>

353
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:41,128
<i>Stay with me,
if you don't want to be afraid.</i>

354
00:34:50,057 --> 00:34:51,970
<i>Is that all you have?</i>

355
00:34:52,962 --> 00:34:54,940
<i>You buy new things.</i>

356
00:34:55,977 --> 00:34:58,745
<i>Anyway,
here you will wear a uniform.</i>

357
00:35:54,584 --> 00:35:57,831
<i>How is everyone in the village?</i>

358
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,920
<i>It's okay.</i>

359
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,691
<i>You can shower there.</i>

360
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:23,225
<i>We want them alive!</i>

361
00:37:23,226 --> 00:37:26,284
<i>We want them alive!</i>

362
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:29,343
<i>We want them alive!</i>

363
00:37:29,344 --> 00:37:32,403
<i>We want them alive!</i>

364
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,378
It's an invasion.

365
00:37:40,379 --> 00:37:43,170
When will you leave us alone?

366
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,128
We'd better stay indoors.
It can be dangerous.

367
00:37:47,878 --> 00:37:51,337
Anything you need, ask Letona.

368
00:37:51,338 --> 00:37:53,044
Did you hear that, Sara?

369
00:37:53,045 --> 00:37:56,377
Good news.
You won't need to go to school.

370
00:37:56,378 --> 00:37:58,670
But I want to go to school.

371
00:37:59,628 --> 00:38:03,003
It's only for a few days. I am also
not going to work at the hospital.

372
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,212
It is not right for
women to live alone.

373
00:38:09,753 --> 00:38:13,378
They should come and live here.
The house is big.

374
00:38:13,379 --> 00:38:16,878
Furthermore, here we will
be protected by the guards.

375
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,087
Think of your daughter.

376
00:38:44,795 --> 00:38:47,212
What's that?
They are attacking us!

377
00:38:48,132 --> 00:38:50,495
- Sara! <i> - Get away from the window!
Follow me.</i>

378
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:52,628
<i>Come on, fast, fast! We will.</i>

379
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:54,329
- I'll get Sara. - Are you sure?

380
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,753
Yes, stay with my parents. Sara!

381
00:39:07,824 --> 00:39:09,124
Sara!

382
00:39:11,337 --> 00:39:14,587
<i>I request reinforcements.
Calling all units.</i>

383
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:17,531
Sara?

384
00:39:17,952 --> 00:39:19,252
<i>Do what we say.</i>

385
00:39:19,253 --> 00:39:21,253
Are you ي?  Sara?

386
00:39:25,604 --> 00:39:26,907
Sara?

387
00:39:28,837 --> 00:39:31,689
She is not here.
Stay away from the window.

388
00:39:32,795 --> 00:39:34,294
I can't find Sara.

389
00:39:34,295 --> 00:39:35,938
<i>Those rioters took her away.</i>

390
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:37,467
<i>You went crazy.</i>

391
00:39:38,474 --> 00:39:41,324
- She must walk around ي.
- They surrounded the main windows.

392
00:39:41,325 --> 00:39:43,075
Use tear gas immediately.

393
00:39:43,076 --> 00:39:44,376
- Sara? - More flyers.

394
00:39:44,377 --> 00:39:45,377
More?

395
00:39:45,378 --> 00:39:47,278
- Did they break another window?
- Yes.

396
00:39:48,758 --> 00:39:50,058
Sara?

397
00:40:27,745 --> 00:40:29,045
<i>Seven.</i>

398
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,420
<i>Eight.</i>

399
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,670
<i>Nine.</i>

400
00:40:35,078 --> 00:40:36,378
<i>Ten.</i>

401
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:39,003
<i>Eleven.</i>

402
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:40,837
<i>Twelve.</i>

403
00:40:42,578 --> 00:40:43,878
<i>Thirteen.</i>

404
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,003
<i>Fourteen.</i>

405
00:40:49,203 --> 00:40:50,545
<i>Fifteen.</i>

406
00:40:53,045 --> 00:40:54,545
<i>Sixteen.</i>

407
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,476
<i>- Seventeen.</i> - Sara?

408
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,419
<i>Eighteen.</i>

409
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,128
Release it! What are you doing?

410
00:41:03,078 --> 00:41:04,420
Release it!

411
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,627
- I almost reached twenty-one!
- What are you doing?

412
00:41:07,628 --> 00:41:09,828
Alma is teaching me
to hold my breath

413
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:11,429
to swim under water.

414
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:15,087
Always stay in sight.
Didn't they hear us calling?

415
00:41:15,503 --> 00:41:18,545
- Why do you always hide?
- Let go.

416
00:41:23,295 --> 00:41:25,002
<i>Pay attention.</i>

417
00:41:25,003 --> 00:41:28,920
<i>Come help me.
They are throwing things.</i>

418
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:42,169
<i>Nobody gives up! Nobody forgets!</i>

419
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,753
<i>Enrique Monteverde
is a genocide!</i>

420
00:42:01,587 --> 00:42:05,920
You must not stay here, Enrique.
You can throw stones again.

421
00:42:10,378 --> 00:42:13,294
<i>Justice!  Justice!  Justice!</i>

422
00:42:13,295 --> 00:42:17,584
<i>Justice!  Justice!</i>

423
00:42:17,585 --> 00:42:18,885
<i>Justice!</i>

424
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:21,135
<i>What we want?</i>

425
00:42:21,136 --> 00:42:23,219
<i>We want justice!</i>

426
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,117
<i>We want justice!</i>

427
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,795
These people will
drive me crazy.

428
00:43:12,545 --> 00:43:16,002
Alma told me that in her
village there was a lot of water

429
00:43:16,003 --> 00:43:18,586
and that plants grew quickly.

430
00:43:18,587 --> 00:43:21,669
- You like Alma, don't you?
- She has two children.

431
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:24,128
Two children?
She is still so young!

432
00:43:27,003 --> 00:43:29,419
The Indians have children early.

433
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,296
A boy and a girl.

434
00:43:33,919 --> 00:43:36,119
Who do you leave them
with while she works here?

435
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,420
They died.

436
00:48:24,628 --> 00:48:28,003
<i>Help me, Valerian!
He's bothering me.</i>

437
00:48:29,045 --> 00:48:31,428
Why are you here?  Get out of here!

438
00:48:31,429 --> 00:48:32,729
Letona!

439
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:35,837
<i>Help me!</i>

440
00:48:36,962 --> 00:48:38,628
Take Mr. Enrique out of here.

441
00:48:41,462 --> 00:48:42,962
Good heavens, Daddy!

442
00:48:44,537 --> 00:48:45,878
Take it with you.

443
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:03,128
- I can handle it myself.
- Calm down.

444
00:49:04,962 --> 00:49:06,837
Put him on oxygen, please.

445
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:08,961
Okay.

446
00:49:08,962 --> 00:49:10,837
The floor was flooded.

447
00:49:13,378 --> 00:49:15,503
I don't want you
sleeping in my room.

448
00:49:17,503 --> 00:49:19,837
- Up there?
- Yes, come up, please.

449
00:49:35,837 --> 00:49:38,220
He needs to be hospitalized.

450
00:49:38,962 --> 00:49:40,320
This is not Alzheimer's.

451
00:49:40,321 --> 00:49:42,210
Nobody is going to accept it.

452
00:49:43,378 --> 00:49:47,092
Enrique has always been
delighted to chase women.

453
00:49:47,628 --> 00:49:49,795
Mainly India.

454
00:49:55,962 --> 00:49:59,127
- I put him on oxygen. - Thanks.

455
00:49:59,128 --> 00:50:00,678
- Good night. - Good night.

456
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:02,253
Good night, Valerian.

457
00:50:10,628 --> 00:50:13,712
All women drive Enrique crazy.

458
00:50:16,253 --> 00:50:19,045
Don't think about it.
Do not be affected.

459
00:50:21,945 --> 00:50:25,841
I never thought that at this
age I would go through this.

460
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:33,877
The best thing is that you go to rest.

461
00:50:33,878 --> 00:50:35,916
I don't want you to be sick.

462
00:50:37,295 --> 00:50:39,462
You too, dear, go to sleep.

463
00:50:40,628 --> 00:50:42,795
Did Grandpa do anything to Alma?

464
00:50:42,796 --> 00:50:44,212
Go to bed.

465
00:50:49,295 --> 00:50:51,427
- Good night.
- Good night my dear.

466
00:50:51,428 --> 00:50:52,728
- Good night. - Right.

467
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,920
I'm going to have a glass of water.

468
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,295
In between.

469
00:51:35,003 --> 00:51:36,378
Excuse me, Vale.

470
00:51:36,712 --> 00:51:41,003
Alma, I apologize on
behalf of my father.

471
00:51:41,753 --> 00:51:44,545
I ask you to understand.
He's very stressed.

472
00:51:46,753 --> 00:51:49,087
I promise you it
won't happen again.

473
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:58,495
As of tomorrow,
you will not be wearing a uniform.

474
00:51:58,496 --> 00:52:00,046
It was very fair on you.

475
00:52:00,712 --> 00:52:02,545
Put on your dress.

476
00:52:09,545 --> 00:52:12,378
- Good night. - Good night.

477
00:52:36,628 --> 00:52:38,670
Can you open the shirt, please?

478
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,670
Breathe.

479
00:52:54,995 --> 00:52:56,295
Again.

480
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:03,587
Your bronchi are heavily loaded.

481
00:53:04,628 --> 00:53:07,623
You need to treat this
respiratory deficiency.

482
00:53:08,753 --> 00:53:11,220
With these people out
there, we can't go out.

483
00:53:12,528 --> 00:53:14,970
For me you must
apologize to Alma.

484
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:21,528
Imagine the scandal,
if tomorrow the girl denounces you?

485
00:53:23,237 --> 00:53:25,277
Apologize to her, please.

486
00:53:25,778 --> 00:53:28,278
As a formality.
Do this for us women.

487
00:53:30,087 --> 00:53:33,487
<i>- I've always been a sleepwalker.
- You were never sleepwalker.</i>

488
00:53:37,037 --> 00:53:38,419
<i>The people where are they?</i>

489
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:40,262
<i>For freedom and peace</i>

490
00:53:40,263 --> 00:53:42,057
<i>The people where are they?</i>

491
00:53:42,058 --> 00:53:44,052
<i>For freedom and peace</i>

492
00:53:44,053 --> 00:53:45,675
<i>The people where are they?</i>

493
00:53:45,676 --> 00:53:47,554
<i>For freedom and peace</i>

494
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:40,308
<i>- The united people...
- They will never be defeated!</i>

495
00:54:40,838 --> 00:54:44,611
<i>The united people will
never be defeated!</i>

496
00:54:44,612 --> 00:54:48,502
<i>If someone forgets, we clarify!</i>

497
00:54:48,503 --> 00:54:52,586
<i>Enrique Monteverde
is a genocide!</i>

498
00:54:52,587 --> 00:54:56,544
<i>If someone forgets, we clarify!</i>

499
00:54:56,545 --> 00:55:00,503
<i>Enrique Monteverde
is a genocide!</i>

500
00:55:06,378 --> 00:55:08,045
Examine my eyes.

501
00:55:11,362 --> 00:55:13,002
It looks like conjunctivitis.

502
00:55:13,003 --> 00:55:15,920
I feel that there is a lot
of humidity in our room.

503
00:55:18,987 --> 00:55:23,762
Don't you think it's strange that your
father came up with Valerian one day?

504
00:55:27,962 --> 00:55:29,652
You were too small.

505
00:55:29,653 --> 00:55:33,262
But she was also a child,
a little older than Sara.

506
00:55:34,628 --> 00:55:37,587
And those acts are
not like your father.

507
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:45,103
God sends the toughest
trials to his best servants.

508
00:55:46,295 --> 00:55:48,495
What are you trying to tell me?

509
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,669
That surely Valerian
is your half sister م.

510
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:54,170
Oh, mother, please.

511
00:55:54,528 --> 00:55:56,245
I need to relax.

512
00:56:02,295 --> 00:56:05,152
I thought I got over it.

513
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:08,403
But lately,
I can't stop thinking about it.

514
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:15,815
Perhaps it was a blessing
sent from Heaven,

515
00:56:15,816 --> 00:56:17,787
because what would
i do without her?

516
00:56:26,378 --> 00:56:28,628
How did you meet Valeriana?

517
00:56:33,045 --> 00:56:35,045
You already know.

518
00:56:51,587 --> 00:56:53,728
Why didn't you
like Sara's father?

519
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:02,637
He didn't love you.
Do not confuse the reality.

520
00:57:13,362 --> 00:57:15,587
Love you my princess.

521
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:21,870
I know.

522
00:57:50,087 --> 00:57:51,428
How beautiful.

523
00:57:52,087 --> 00:57:53,453
It really is.

524
00:58:38,195 --> 00:58:39,495
We will.

525
01:00:51,212 --> 01:00:53,194
At your age, it's normal.

526
01:00:53,195 --> 01:00:55,637
- It was an accident. - I know.

527
01:00:58,837 --> 01:01:00,977
<i>Without justice, without justice</i>

528
01:01:00,978 --> 01:01:02,587
<i>There is no peace!</i>

529
01:01:03,686 --> 01:01:06,433
<i>Without justice
there is no peace</i>

530
01:01:07,962 --> 01:01:10,295
You don't have to use it
now, if you don't want to.

531
01:01:11,378 --> 01:01:13,353
<i>Without justice,</i>

532
01:01:13,354 --> 01:01:14,920
<i>There is no peace!</i>

533
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:29,545
If you need to,
you already know where you are.

534
01:02:00,545 --> 01:02:01,895
<i>Sixteen.</i>

535
01:02:03,087 --> 01:02:04,420
<i>Seventeen.</i>

536
01:02:05,653 --> 01:02:06,953
<i>Eighteen.</i>

537
01:02:08,295 --> 01:02:09,687
<i>Nineteen.</i>

538
01:02:10,962 --> 01:02:12,270
<i>Twenty.</i>

539
01:02:14,153 --> 01:02:15,520
<i>Twenty one.</i>

540
01:02:15,987 --> 01:02:17,353
<i>Twenty two.</i>

541
01:02:18,195 --> 01:02:19,545
<i>Twenty three.</i>

542
01:02:20,887 --> 01:02:22,187
<i>Twenty four.</i>

543
01:02:23,112 --> 01:02:24,503
<i>Twenty five.</i>

544
01:02:25,462 --> 01:02:26,837
<i>Twenty-six.</i>

545
01:02:27,587 --> 01:02:29,087
<i>Twenty-seven.</i>

546
01:02:49,153 --> 01:02:50,487
It can't be.

547
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:53,628
Yes you can. It looks like him.

548
01:02:54,462 --> 01:02:55,862
Look carefully.

549
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:58,294
Yes, it looks like it.

550
01:02:58,295 --> 01:02:59,703
Look at the other one.

551
01:03:06,228 --> 01:03:07,528
Look.

552
01:03:15,462 --> 01:03:17,753
- It's him! - It's him.

553
01:03:24,295 --> 01:03:25,945
Sara, what are you doing?

554
01:03:28,695 --> 01:03:31,336
- Don't play with that.
- We're not kidding.

555
01:03:31,337 --> 01:03:32,870
Take it to another corner.

556
01:03:39,253 --> 01:03:41,253
WHERE IS HE?

557
01:04:14,762 --> 01:04:16,877
<i>This historic step
in our country.</i>

558
01:04:16,878 --> 01:04:20,127
<i>The stage of anti-communism,
of the inquisition,</i>

559
01:04:20,128 --> 01:04:22,901
<i>of those who repressed
and massacred,</i>

560
01:04:22,902 --> 01:04:25,758
<i>who committed economic
and human genocide</i>

561
01:04:25,759 --> 01:04:29,170
<i>under the argument of the
fight against communism.</i>

562
01:04:29,962 --> 01:04:33,557
<i>After a historic trial,
with hundreds of testimonies</i>

563
01:04:33,558 --> 01:04:36,586
<i>and the revocation of
a genocide sentence,</i>

564
01:04:36,587 --> 01:04:39,547
<i>the positions that divide
Guatemala's public opinion</i>

565
01:04:39,548 --> 01:04:43,615
<i>seem to be more
distant every day.</i>

566
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:47,745
<i>Guatemala is tired of
crying for their missing.</i>

567
01:04:57,295 --> 01:05:00,337
- Here's what you asked me for.
- Leave ي, please.

568
01:05:02,003 --> 01:05:03,995
And Alma bought this for Sara.

569
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:06,637
Thanks.

570
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:11,811
Is it so risky to leave?

571
01:05:12,112 --> 01:05:13,512
Much.

572
01:05:14,628 --> 01:05:16,903
This confinement
is making us sick.

573
01:05:17,337 --> 01:05:20,212
Yes, I understand.

574
01:05:22,867 --> 01:05:27,670
Letona... Do you know
anything about Sara's father?

575
01:05:28,462 --> 01:05:31,728
Doesn't it seem strange to you that
he suddenly disappears like that?

576
01:05:33,045 --> 01:05:35,295
I do not have access
to that information.

577
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:38,212
Nobody knows what he was in for.

578
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:45,337
It is better that you stay
away from these matters.

579
01:05:59,878 --> 01:06:01,200
Excuse.

580
01:06:46,253 --> 01:06:49,212
- Need help? - No.

581
01:07:11,712 --> 01:07:13,045
And Sara?

582
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,570
Watching TV.

583
01:07:18,212 --> 01:07:19,753
Come, sit down.

584
01:07:27,087 --> 01:07:29,895
Did Sara see when my
mom surprised my dad?

585
01:07:30,545 --> 01:07:32,012
- Was she scared? - No.

586
01:07:37,237 --> 01:07:38,903
What was Sara's father like?

587
01:07:43,753 --> 01:07:45,503
Did Sara tell you about him?

588
01:07:47,628 --> 01:07:50,653
She wants to know what he
looks like and where he is.

589
01:07:56,003 --> 01:07:59,545
My children's father was
very thin and smiled a lot.

590
01:08:00,753 --> 01:08:02,420
Where is he?

591
01:08:03,962 --> 01:08:05,353
I don't know.

592
01:08:05,928 --> 01:08:08,253
- Abandoned you? - No.

593
01:08:13,045 --> 01:08:15,087
What about you, did he abandon?

594
01:08:19,253 --> 01:08:21,087
I never knew.

595
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:24,970
Excuse.

596
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:31,419
Sara's father was called Carlos.

597
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,170
He also laughed a lot.

598
01:10:46,545 --> 01:10:49,502
- Wind. - <i> Wind.</i>

599
01:10:49,503 --> 01:10:51,880
- Fly. <i> - Fly.</i>

600
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:53,919
- Cold. <i> - Cold.</i>

601
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,794
- Rain. <i> - Rain.</i>

602
01:10:55,795 --> 01:10:57,685
- Water. <i> - Water.</i>

603
01:10:57,686 --> 01:10:58,986
<i>Valerian?</i>

604
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:04,539
<i>Valerian!</i>

605
01:11:07,831 --> 01:11:09,131
Valerian!

606
01:11:09,132 --> 01:11:10,432
<i>What do you say?</i>

607
01:11:12,045 --> 01:11:13,345
What do you say?

608
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,712
It kills me slowly.

609
01:11:34,212 --> 01:11:36,377
<i>It's a curse on you.</i>

610
01:11:36,378 --> 01:11:38,003
Take it all off, please.

611
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:41,462
First, we need to purge you.

612
01:11:54,837 --> 01:11:58,214
<i>All the hate and words
about solid things</i>

613
01:11:58,215 --> 01:12:03,002
<i>they must disappear from this
house for the good of this family.</i>

614
01:12:03,003 --> 01:12:07,794
<i>Ancestors, help us to
understand what we did wrong.</i>

615
01:12:07,795 --> 01:12:11,836
<i>Protect our family
from the devil.</i>

616
01:12:11,837 --> 01:12:15,545
<i>Get the demon out of here.</i>

617
01:12:33,587 --> 01:12:35,253
We better get in.

618
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,220
We will.

619
01:12:40,212 --> 01:12:41,512
Come on, mom.

620
01:12:56,337 --> 01:12:59,128
<i>I told Juana from your village.</i>

621
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:03,670
<i>I looked for it because
we need more help.</i>

622
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,753
<i>She said she doesn't know you.</i>

623
01:13:14,462 --> 01:13:15,962
<i>Where you are from?</i>

624
01:13:21,253 --> 01:13:23,961
<i>From the heart of the mountains.</i>

625
01:13:23,962 --> 01:13:25,420
<i>Right next to the river.</i>

626
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:32,003
<i>Where was the military
camp stationed?</i>

627
01:13:38,462 --> 01:13:42,420
<i>I lived there until
the massacre started.</i>

628
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:46,545
<i>How old are you?</i>

629
01:13:49,087 --> 01:13:50,753
<i>I don't know anymore.</i>

630
01:15:50,378 --> 01:15:51,712
<i>Come on.</i>

631
01:17:52,587 --> 01:17:54,566
Sara. Sara!

632
01:17:54,567 --> 01:17:55,782
Dad!

633
01:17:59,587 --> 01:18:01,795
Enrique, what are you doing?

634
01:18:01,796 --> 01:18:03,096
Enrique, no!

635
01:18:03,097 --> 01:18:04,888
- No! - The motherfucker

636
01:18:04,889 --> 01:18:06,803
<i>hides under the water.</i>

637
01:18:06,804 --> 01:18:08,336
- Help! <i> - Give me the pistol!</i>

638
01:18:08,337 --> 01:18:11,211
<i>Don't blame me.
It's all her fault.</i>

639
01:18:11,212 --> 01:18:12,711
<i>It's Sara!</i>

640
01:18:12,712 --> 01:18:16,002
<i>No. This guerrilla
is under the water.</i>

641
01:18:16,003 --> 01:18:17,743
It is my daughter
that you will kill!

642
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,618
Give me the pistol.
Bring my medical bag.

643
01:18:21,619 --> 01:18:22,919
Walking!

644
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,220
Walking!

645
01:18:24,221 --> 01:18:25,669
Get away.

646
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:27,039
Valerian, get away!

647
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,801
- Walking. - I am your father.

648
01:18:28,802 --> 01:18:30,102
You don't know anything!

649
01:18:30,670 --> 01:18:32,420
Hold on tight, Valerian.

650
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:36,795
<i>Leave me!</i>

651
01:18:37,378 --> 01:18:41,420
Everything that happens in this
house is that woman's fault!

652
01:18:41,421 --> 01:18:43,753
Don't get hurt,
it's hurting you.

653
01:18:43,754 --> 01:18:46,151
Letona! Latvia.

654
01:19:27,337 --> 01:19:28,637
Himself.

655
01:19:28,638 --> 01:19:29,938
Himself.

656
01:19:31,378 --> 01:19:33,752
That sucks.
Where are the guards?

657
01:19:33,753 --> 01:19:36,295
They are not strong
enough for them.

658
01:19:40,628 --> 01:19:42,128
<i>My child.</i>

659
01:19:47,503 --> 01:19:48,878
<i>My child.</i>

660
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:55,628
Alma screams for her children.

661
01:19:56,753 --> 01:20:00,295
She said she knew
Grandpa from long ago.

662
01:20:01,587 --> 01:20:03,337
What else did she say?

663
01:20:04,462 --> 01:20:06,253
That I shouldn't drown.

664
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:11,212
Valerian, what's going on?

665
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:13,087
What have we done?

666
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:18,670
Walk, gather all the
candles you can and act.

667
01:20:19,037 --> 01:20:20,337
We will.

668
01:20:23,837 --> 01:20:25,419
Look.

669
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:26,720
Don't look at them.

670
01:20:33,003 --> 01:20:34,303
The hands.

671
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:40,711
<i>I appeal to the four elements
and our protective ancestors.</i>

672
01:20:40,712 --> 01:20:44,252
<i>Spirits,
speak to us through fire.</i>

673
01:20:44,253 --> 01:20:46,420
<i>What can we do for you?</i>

674
01:20:46,421 --> 01:20:51,337
<i>Spirits, go back to your rest,
there is nothing here for you.</i>

675
01:20:51,338 --> 01:20:54,586
<i>Forgive us if we offend you.</i>

676
01:20:54,587 --> 01:20:57,836
<i>We ask you to leave us alone.</i>

677
01:20:57,837 --> 01:21:00,127
<i>If the general
owes you any debt,</i>

678
01:21:00,128 --> 01:21:04,837
<i>please understand that we
have nothing to do with it.</i>

679
01:21:07,253 --> 01:21:09,419
<i>Have compassion on
us and leave us.</i>

680
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:11,294
<i>Leave us alone.</i>

681
01:21:11,295 --> 01:21:17,295
<i>It is unfair to make innocent
people pay the consequences.</i>

682
01:21:18,253 --> 01:21:19,553
<i>Don't hurt us.</i>

683
01:21:19,554 --> 01:21:21,794
<i>We are trying to help.</i>

684
01:21:21,795 --> 01:21:23,503
Sara, open your eyes.

685
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:26,128
Breathe, breathe.

686
01:21:27,837 --> 01:21:29,336
Please.

687
01:21:29,337 --> 01:21:31,961
<i>Tell us what you want.</i>

688
01:21:31,962 --> 01:21:34,462
Mother, what is it?

689
01:21:36,007 --> 01:21:37,507
<i>MOTHER!</i>

690
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:50,520
Come on!

691
01:21:52,911 --> 01:21:54,211
Go here!

692
01:21:58,087 --> 01:22:01,044
Tell me where the
guerrillas are hiding.

693
01:22:01,045 --> 01:22:03,628
<i>I don't understand what you say.</i>

694
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:07,253
<i>My husband is not part
of the guerrillas.</i>

695
01:22:08,253 --> 01:22:09,837
<i>We were never part of it.</i>

696
01:22:10,545 --> 01:22:11,845
<i>Please.</i>

697
01:22:11,846 --> 01:22:14,420
<i>Release my children.</i>

698
01:22:14,421 --> 01:22:17,295
Tell them where they
are or I'll drown them.

699
01:22:20,295 --> 01:22:21,962
<i>I don't know.</i>

700
01:22:22,795 --> 01:22:26,253
<i>I don't know.</i>

701
01:22:28,670 --> 01:22:30,210
<i>My children!</i>

702
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:31,511
<i>My children!</i>

703
01:22:31,823 --> 01:22:33,123
<i>My children!</i>

704
01:22:37,045 --> 01:22:38,462
<i>My children.</i>

705
01:22:39,378 --> 01:22:40,678
<i>My children.</i>

706
01:24:40,962 --> 01:24:42,262
My general.

707
01:25:29,503 --> 01:25:31,212
<i>My children!</i>
