6
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:28,760
Bread and Tulips

7
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:06,760
In the year 273 B.C.
when the Romans came here

8
00:01:06,807 --> 00:01:10,800
and encountered the Greeks
for the first time,

9
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:14,806
history took a huge leap forward. 
What do I mean by that?

10
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:18,800
Greek idealism, a civilization
of music and philosophy,

11
00:01:18,847 --> 00:01:22,806
and roman pragmatism,

12
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:26,635
a civilization of law
and rationality,

13
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:30,919
blended perfectly to
create a new culture,

14
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:35,119
that forms the basis
of Western civilization,       

15
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:39,046
of which we Italians, the
greatest people on earth,

16
00:01:39,087 --> 00:01:43,285
should be the proud heirs.
Our blood contains the genes

17
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:47,878
of Greeks and Romans, the greatest
civilizations of all time.

18
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:51,966
These genes are what urge you

19
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:55,477
to leave the train of rationality

20
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:59,486
in the main station of your town:
Verona, Turin, Milan...

21
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:03,281
- Pescara.
- Why not? Pescara too...

22
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:07,286
for the ship of fantasy to sail
the routes of ancient peoples

23
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:11,286
and drink to their enthusiasm.

24
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:19,800
We're now in the temple of Ceres.

25
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:23,396
Although scholars claim that
it is dedicated to Athena.

26
00:02:23,447 --> 00:02:27,725
Athena in Greek, Minerva in Latin.

27
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:32,636
Do you know, who Minerva was, 
apart of a brand of matches?

28
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:36,885
Minerva, china bathroom fittings
with porcellain and chrome piping.

29
00:02:39,007 --> 00:02:43,080                        
- The same old bullshit!
- You know Dad's humor...

30
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:51,439
- Can you put this in your bag?
- Does anybody know, who Aphrodite was?

31
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:55,605
- The goddess of beauty
- And love too.

32
00:02:55,647 --> 00:02:59,276
Because love is more important 
then beauty.

33
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:07,406
Grandma, can you lend me
10.000 lire?

34
00:03:07,447 --> 00:03:11,725
- Samy, you already had your allowance.                      
- So did her cousins.

35
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:15,680
- Mom...
- Salvo, film us...

36
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:19,720
Come on, Alba. Get us here, 
right here, by the column,

37
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:23,760
with the temple behind us. Closer.                

39
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:30,280
Eight steel pans with a double bottom.

40
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:34,320
Take a look at the new microfiber
line. It's a perfect fit.

41
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:38,360
I'm sorry, but I've had mine for
40 years and they're fine.

42
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:42,400
This is the "young" line
Anyhow I was talking to Rosa.

43
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:46,645                        
Samy, stop it. Ask your father better, 

44
00:03:46,687 --> 00:03:50,680
if we need the pan with the drainer.
I even got slips from "Positano".

45
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:54,163
It's lithium. It lasts 96 hours.

46
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:58,200
They say you don't have to change it.
It lasts a lifetime.

47
00:03:58,247 --> 00:04:02,798
I recharged it last night and it's 
still going. The other batteries are useless.

48
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:06,840
- Still got the same number?
- It's a GSM.

49
00:04:06,887 --> 00:04:11,244
- Dad, can I call Cinzia?
- One minute then! It's a peak time.

51
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:36,883
Nic? Call your friends in Rome,
those with the house in Francavilla.

52
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:40,439
Nic!

53
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:44,639
You coud see your friends in Rome,
while we're at St Peter's.

54
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:49,238
- What friends?
- Those with the beach house.

55
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:04,839
Be careful!

56
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:08,675
Lello, where are the restrooms?

58
00:05:24,487 --> 00:05:28,480
Hello? I'd like a sandwich
and some water!

59
00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:46,245
Oh my gosh...
How can I get it?

61
00:05:55,407 --> 00:05:57,398
My tweezers...

62
00:06:07,207 --> 00:06:09,767
Disgusting.

63
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:13,766
God, what an idiot.

64
00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:25,244
Maybe with that...

65
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:50,476
Where are they?

66
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:54,444
There they are.

67
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:57,001
Oh! What are they doing?

69
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:06,603
They're just leaving...

70
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:08,683
But...

72
00:07:14,847 --> 00:07:17,441
0-3-3-6-7...

73
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:23,446
He's changed his number!
For God's sake, what now...

74
00:07:33,047 --> 00:07:36,881
They haven't even noticed I'm gone

75
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:44,284
Would Mrs. Rosalba Barletta
please come to the phone.

76
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:46,682
That's me.

77
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:50,606
I don't believe it! Always you!

78
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:55,118
You all left without me!
I was in the restroom, Mimmo!

79
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:59,285
- You fell asleep in the can?
- Of course not!

80
00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:03,605
- What do we do now?
- I don't know.

81
00:08:03,687 --> 00:08:07,919
- We're two hours behind the schedule
- You should have checked before leaving.

82
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:11,596
- So it's our fault?
- You're the one who's missing!

83
00:08:11,687 --> 00:08:16,283
- I noticed.
- Do me a favor: Wait there and don't move.

84
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:20,286
- Okay?
- Yes, okay.

87
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:11,280
Sorry, I'm hopeless.

88
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:15,605
- Join the club.
- Believe me, I'm unequalled.

89
00:09:27,087 --> 00:09:31,160
Now he controls it all.
He makes 10.000 kinds of bread:

90
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:35,166
With seaweed, truffles...
He's raking the money in.

91
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:39,246
Before I never even realized,
he had such a head for business.

92
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:43,644
He was stoned around the clock,
but we screwed like crazy.

93
00:09:43,687 --> 00:09:47,726
When I came back, I forgot about him.

94
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:52,716
I had problems with my bar and
then, one fine day he turned up!

95
00:09:52,847 --> 00:09:57,079
Him, the asshole! There I was,
holding Brussels sprouts and

96
00:09:57,407 --> 00:10:02,003
he says: "Hi, kitten." No one
had called me "kitten" before.

97
00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:06,282
Now, when he whistles, I come running.

98
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:10,605
I'm boring you to death with 
all my talk, aren't I?

99
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:15,118
So, they forgot you and 
you're standing them up.

100
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:18,284
Not exactly. I want to get 
back to Pescara.

101
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:22,286
I never get to spend time 
at home alone.

102
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:26,320
I've got loads of things to do.

103
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:30,724
Until recently, I thought 
"housewife" was an insult.

104
00:10:31,287 --> 00:10:35,439
Nowadays, I envy you. Oh holy 
Christ, have I offended you?

105
00:10:35,487 --> 00:10:39,446
- I used to work too.
- What did you do?

106
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,446
For a while, I worked in my uncle's
hardware store, then I helped to 

107
00:10:43,487 --> 00:10:47,765
keep my husband's accounts. He's in 
bathroom fittings with his brother.

108
00:10:47,807 --> 00:10:51,766
- Then the boys were born.
- How old are they?

109
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:55,760
One's almost 18, the other's 16.

110
00:10:56,047 --> 00:10:58,038
- Wow! You married young.
- I was 21.

111
00:10:58,087 --> 00:11:02,046
At 21, I was in Copenhagen
for my second abortion.

112
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:06,683
My life could have been different.
I'd surely made a terrible mother!

113
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:11,237
Why do you say that?

114
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:17,759
- Are you from Udine?
- No.

115
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:24,086
I thought, you lived there.

116
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:28,086
- Are you going there for work?
- Not exactly.

117
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:35,724
Before he moved to Germany, my 
brother spent 2 years in Udine.

118
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:40,079
He kept inviting me to go to Venice.

119
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:44,086
I've never been there.

120
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:51,480
You've never seen Venice?.
I can take you, have to go there.

122
00:11:57,447 --> 00:12:00,484
Do you drive?

123
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:17,480
"New parents wanted"

125
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:58,484
Thank you and good night.

127
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:44,879
Pension Mirandolina

128
00:13:47,887 --> 00:13:51,277
Watch your head.

129
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,758
Here, please.

130
00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:02,960
It's clean, you know.
We've let it go a bit,

131
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,683
because we're closing down. You
may well be our last guest.

132
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:14,083
- It's perfect, thank you.
- The bathroom is down the hall

133
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:19,280
- if you'll need it.
- Where can I get something to eat?

134
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,518
There's a Chinese around 
the corner or...

135
00:14:23,927 --> 00:14:28,284
the "Marco Polo", to the left
outside, second on the right.

136
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:31,842
Left and second on the right...

137
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:36,278
I'll leave you now.
The Key! Excuse me.

138
00:14:52,487 --> 00:14:55,479
- Motel Elma, what can I do for you?

139
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:59,281
Can I speak to Mr. Barletta?

140
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,285
- Hold the line.
- Thanks.

141
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:07,279
- Hello?
- Mimmo, it's me.

142
00:15:07,327 --> 00:15:12,276
Alba, where are you? What happened?

143
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:16,960
- I'm fine, don't worry.
- Where the fuck are you?

144
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:21,637
- Calm down. I'll see you at home tomorrow.
- What d'you mean? Are you nuts?

145
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:25,885
Cut that out!
I waited 2 hours in that service area.

146
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:30,318
I even called the cops!
And you tell me to "calm down"?

147
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:32,358
Hello?

148
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,518
Good evening.

149
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:51,402
I must advise you, the cook
has come down with the appendicitis.

150
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:55,406
- Poor thing!
- Therefore, I regret to inform you,

151
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:58,484
that we can only serve cold dishes.

152
00:15:58,527 --> 00:16:02,679
That's fine. Something cold
would although do it.

153
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:06,079
- Please be seated.
- Thank you.

154
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:15,123
I hope it is to your liking.

155
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:19,240
It's better then to go to Chinese.

156
00:16:19,487 --> 00:16:23,685
Forgive me, but the Chinese 
are the best restauranteurs.

158
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:59,680
I can mend it.

159
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:09,277
How does this thing work?

161
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:55,282
Nancy, what's up?

162
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:00,279
My balcony's packed with these.
I don't know where to put them.

163
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:04,646
Try one, they taste good!

164
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:07,679
Here, they cook in no time.

165
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:14,878
Nancy, tell Nic not to dye his hair.
He wants to go blond.

166
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,964
He said red to me.

167
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:21,966
- To be honest, I agree with him.
- What?

168
00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:26,285
This wallpaper's so depressing!
Why don't you change it?

169
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:32,278
- I'm just passing through.
- Who isn't?

172
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:17,122
Guess where

173
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:20,680
I am.

175
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:40,879
Oh my gosh!

176
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:12,278
Hi, it's me.
I'm calling to say,

177
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:16,286
that I missed the train.
And... I'm in Venice.

178
00:20:16,327 --> 00:20:20,559
There is some lasagna in the 
oven... in the refrigerator:

179
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:24,646
10 minutes in the microwave 
and it's done.

180
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:28,646
I'm really sorry.
I'll be back tomorrow at 3:30.

181
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:31,679
No, wait. The train arrives...

182
00:20:31,727 --> 00:20:35,686
At 3:28 p.m. to be precise.
Lots of love.

183
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:24,399
May I ask you something?

184
00:21:24,447 --> 00:21:28,440
I missed my train and need to 
spend another night here,

185
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:32,844
but the pension where I slept 
last night has closed 

186
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:36,960
and I don't have much left.

187
00:21:37,007 --> 00:21:41,000
I don't wish to pry but how 
much is at your disposal?

188
00:21:42,007 --> 00:21:44,680
About 38.700 lire.

189
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:50,561
I'm afraid it's an inadequate sum
for any kind of befitting accomodation.

190
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:02,280
This is it.

191
00:22:26,247 --> 00:22:30,001
I've slept here on occasion 
a couple of times

192
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:34,086
and its appearance does rather 
go against it.

193
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:39,880
I'll retrieve you a pillow 
and some sheets.

194
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:18,076
I'll do it.

195
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:23,282
I don' know how to thank you.

196
00:23:23,327 --> 00:23:27,286
The bathroom is located a few 
steps from here in the entryway.

197
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:32,276
You're not Italian.

198
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,524
No. I come from Iceland.

199
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:37,717
Reykjavik!

200
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:39,325
Nearby.

201
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:43,360
As a girl, I'd recite all 
European capitals

202
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:48,276
- and my grandad'd give me 100 lire.
- I'm delighted.

203
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:52,286
Feel free to lock the door,

204
00:23:52,327 --> 00:23:56,286
if that will make your night
more serene.

205
00:24:15,847 --> 00:24:19,840
"I hope you spent a happy night.


206
00:24:21,247 --> 00:24:25,160
I'd ask you to lock the door

207
00:24:25,207 --> 00:24:28,199
before you leave and 

208
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:32,206
deposit the keys in the letterbox.

209
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:36,240
I wish you all the best.
Fernando Girasole."

210
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:43,276
He writes his "T"s like Napoleon.

211
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:55,076
Oh my gosh.

212
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:58,119
"I won't

213
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:00,163
forget

214
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:04,156
your 

215
00:25:06,447 --> 00:25:09,678
kindness...

216
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:17,480
and the 

217
00:25:17,527 --> 00:25:20,519
wonderful breakfast."

218
00:25:58,407 --> 00:26:00,875
"Help needed"

219
00:26:10,287 --> 00:26:14,041
- Good morning.
- Come back later for the wreath, 

220
00:26:14,087 --> 00:26:17,921
- I had an accident.
- What happened?

221
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:22,722
- I fell. Come back later!
- Actually, I'm here because of the sign.

222
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:26,885
- What sign?
- The one in the window.

223
00:26:27,487 --> 00:26:31,878
You? You won't do. I need 
a strong young man!

224
00:26:36,807 --> 00:26:41,642
I think you're wrong.
What you need is a woman.

225
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:45,885
Anybody ever told you, that
you look like Vera Zasulic?

226
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:49,039
- No, who's she?
- A libertarian.

227
00:26:49,087 --> 00:26:53,080
She pulled out a gun one day 
and shot Trepov,

228
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:56,836
Governor of St Petersburg!

229
00:26:56,887 --> 00:27:01,085
- When was that?
- January 24th, 1874

230
00:27:02,527 --> 00:27:06,839
Why should I hire you?

231
00:27:07,607 --> 00:27:10,838
I have a green thumb.
My father was Gardner.

232
00:27:10,887 --> 00:27:14,163
- A gardner...
- Yes, at the palace in Caserta.

235
00:27:57,607 --> 00:28:00,246
They're still here.

236
00:28:31,007 --> 00:28:33,237
May I?

238
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:17,086
Who's that?

239
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:24,439
- Fernando's not here?
- No..

240
00:29:24,487 --> 00:29:27,479
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

241
00:29:27,527 --> 00:29:32,282
Help me, my bathroom is flooded!
Please, quickly! This way!

242
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:38,526
Oh my gosh!
Turn off the main faucet!

243
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:42,276
- Where is it?
- You don't know?

245
00:30:01,487 --> 00:30:05,082
What a nightmare!

246
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:13,677
I didn't even introduced myself.
Grazia Reginella, holistic

247
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:18,682
- beautician and masseuse.
- Rosalba Maresanto, housewife.

248
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:23,960
I don't know what I'd do
without you. Thanks a million!

249
00:30:24,007 --> 00:30:27,283
No problem.

250
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:31,286
- Are you a friend of Fernando's?
- No, a guest

251
00:30:31,327 --> 00:30:34,956
- Here on vacation?
- On vacation? Yes...

252
00:30:35,047 --> 00:30:38,835
My god, you're all wet.
I'm so sorry. What can I do?

253
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:41,879
Want a vodka?

254
00:30:57,287 --> 00:31:01,280
Ohh, got me frightened! I went
to the restaurant, but it

255
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:05,639
was closed. I wanted to ask, 
if I could stay another night?

256
00:31:05,687 --> 00:31:08,645
Tomorrow I'll find a room to rent.

257
00:31:08,687 --> 00:31:13,078
- What led you to change your plans?
- I found a job.

258
00:31:14,687 --> 00:31:18,077
But please, don't bother with my room.

259
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:21,164
I've already done it.

260
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:28,684
Drat, I've put my foot on it.

261
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:41,437
"I wish to apologize for my

262
00:31:41,487 --> 00:31:45,526
unreasonable behaviour last night.

263
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:50,277
Unless it appears unsuitable 
to you, given the...

264
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:54,846
inadequacy..."
What a way to write!

265
00:31:54,887 --> 00:31:58,721
"of the accomodation, please 
take the room at the end of

266
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:02,726
the corridor in your possession."

268
00:32:22,087 --> 00:32:24,920
I can tidy it up a bit...

269
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:37,678
Why is this bathrobe here?
Is it a right place for it?

270
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:45,886
- What's this letter?
- It's from mom.

271
00:32:45,927 --> 00:32:50,045
- What are you waiting for then?
- I'd have told you.

272
00:32:50,087 --> 00:32:54,046
- What does she write?
- She says she's fine.

273
00:32:54,087 --> 00:32:58,717
She hasn't called to avoid a fight.
She is still in Venice.

274
00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:02,766
"... so I thought I'd take 
a short vacation.

275
00:33:02,807 --> 00:33:07,278
After all everyone gets a time off.
I've found a job."

276
00:33:07,327 --> 00:33:12,276
Is she on vacation or working?
I mean, we go away every year.

277
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:18,036
"P.S.: Please can you care for the 
plants on the kitchen's balcony

278
00:33:18,127 --> 00:33:22,245
every 2. day? Especially the
mint dries up quickly."

279
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:27,160
Which one is the mint?
Salvo!

280
00:33:27,647 --> 00:33:30,639
- Is this mint?
- Yes.

281
00:33:30,687 --> 00:33:33,042
Hold it.

282
00:33:33,087 --> 00:33:36,284
- Papa, what are you doing...
- It sure won't dry up now!

283
00:33:36,327 --> 00:33:38,761
Cut it out.

284
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:42,766
Hey honey, just a second.

285
00:33:42,807 --> 00:33:45,799
- Where are you going?
- To Cinzia's.

286
00:33:45,847 --> 00:33:48,759
- Having dinner there?
- Yes. Ciao.

287
00:33:48,807 --> 00:33:53,039
- When will you be back?
- I don't know. Later.

288
00:33:57,887 --> 00:34:02,039
- You're not eating?
- I'm not hungry.

289
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:07,277
Did you read your mom's letter?

290
00:34:07,327 --> 00:34:11,286
- Do you think it's normal?
- How should I know?

292
00:34:16,447 --> 00:34:20,281
Hi Mama! I was on my way over.
Alba wrote again.

293
00:34:20,327 --> 00:34:23,842
- What mouthwash do you use?
- I don't.

294
00:34:23,887 --> 00:34:26,879
- What does she say?
- She's on vacation.

295
00:34:26,927 --> 00:34:30,886
She'll be back soon. She said 
she'd lend me her travel drier.

296
00:34:30,927 --> 00:34:33,919
- It's in the bathroom I guess?
- Where are you going?

297
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:38,518
That cruise I won, to the Fjords.
Here it is. Cute!

298
00:34:38,567 --> 00:34:41,639
- When do you go?
- In 2 days.

299
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:45,726
Honey, try to drop by, if you can.
The washing machine door is stuck.

300
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:50,079
- Have you eaten?
- No, I'm dieting. Nothing fits.

301
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:55,077
Mimmo...

302
00:34:57,567 --> 00:35:01,560
Can we meet a bit later on Thursday?

303
00:35:01,607 --> 00:35:05,600
- I have to take Samy to the dentist.
- Ketty, I'm desperate.

304
00:35:05,647 --> 00:35:09,401
The coffeemachine blew up yesterday.

305
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:13,679
- And what should I tell the neighbors?
- Say she's on vacation.

306
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:19,282
Could you iron a few shirts for me?

307
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:23,798
Mimmo, are you crazy? 
I'm your mistress, not your wife! 

308
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:28,079
- Okay, but after 5 years...
- I hope Rosy's back soon.

309
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:33,238
Come on, move it!

310
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:40,683
You think it's normal,
somebody just goes like that?

311
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:46,078
Can't we do anything from the 
legal point of view?

312
00:35:46,207 --> 00:35:51,076
The last thing I need is a private 
eye bleeding me dry!

313
00:35:51,127 --> 00:35:55,086
Good idea, great!
We need more counselors like you.

314
00:35:55,607 --> 00:35:59,680
Thanks a lot. Ciao. Ciao!

316
00:36:07,887 --> 00:36:12,358
Mimmo? I go to that kindergarten 
to Civitella.

317
00:36:12,407 --> 00:36:16,400
The plumber, Di Matteo sent is here.

318
00:36:16,447 --> 00:36:19,564
Can you deal with him?

319
00:36:19,607 --> 00:36:23,043
Ah, any news?

320
00:36:23,087 --> 00:36:27,046
When I get any news, you'll be 
the first who knows, all right?

321
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:29,078
All right.

322
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:38,080
"Costantino Caponangeli...."
Nice name.

323
00:36:38,687 --> 00:36:43,078
"Plumber and shutter fitter.

324
00:36:43,687 --> 00:36:47,680
Intern with the MGCF..." What's that?

325
00:36:47,807 --> 00:36:51,925
The Municipal Gas Company of Foggia.

326
00:36:51,967 --> 00:36:55,926
A sportsman, I see...
"Third place in the

327
00:36:55,967 --> 00:37:00,245
regional darts tournament."
You've put your hobbies too.

328
00:37:01,087 --> 00:37:03,237
"Reading detective stories."

329
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:10,158
How come?

330
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:15,919
- I... I love them.
- How many have you read?

331
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:20,677
- I'd have to check...
- Off the top of your head.

332
00:37:21,287 --> 00:37:24,279
285... and a half.

333
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:28,286
Holy shit!

334
00:37:31,807 --> 00:37:34,446
- Are you married?
- No.

335
00:37:34,487 --> 00:37:38,116
- Engaged?
- No.

336
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:42,160
- Willing to relocate?
- Yes, where?

337
00:37:42,247 --> 00:37:46,684
Venice. Ever been there?

338
00:37:55,527 --> 00:37:58,087
My wife.

339
00:38:00,127 --> 00:38:04,166
I'm out of saran wrap, 
but look what I did:

340
00:38:04,207 --> 00:38:08,678
O for omelet, C for cheese, M for
mortadella. If you want one with 

341
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:12,680
- Milan Salami I'll put an MS..
- Mama, I'm going to Venice,

342
00:38:12,767 --> 00:38:17,283
- not for camping in Alps.
- How long will this last?

343
00:38:17,327 --> 00:38:21,923
10 days or so, I already told you.
Anyways, I've got the mobile.

344
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:26,279
I can only call Mr. Barletta,
but you can call me anytime.

345
00:38:26,647 --> 00:38:30,879
This is a steady job!
1.700.000 lire plus benefits.

346
00:38:31,327 --> 00:38:34,319
But why Venice?

347
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:38,679
It's a city with enormous problems.
They even called a Dutch engineer.

348
00:38:38,727 --> 00:38:42,606
- I'll miss my train...
- Have you got your asthma spray?

349
00:38:42,647 --> 00:38:45,639
- Yes.
- Is your money in your socks?

350
00:38:45,687 --> 00:38:48,645
You want me to miss the train?

351
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:52,276
At least say good bye to Silvia.

352
00:38:52,327 --> 00:38:59,278
- We're not engaged...
- Go on Tino!

353
00:39:01,447 --> 00:39:05,679
- Ciao, Mama.
- Have a good trip, son.

354
00:39:06,007 --> 00:39:09,283
Take care!

359
00:39:50,127 --> 00:39:54,086
Hello? Good evening, Mr. Barletta.

360
00:39:54,127 --> 00:39:58,518
No, I don't have a room yet. 
I just got here. Yes!

361
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:03,482
On the train, I drew up an action 
plan. It won't take me long.

362
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:07,520
Yes. Good bye. Good-bye Mr. Barletta.

363
00:40:07,567 --> 00:40:11,685
Excuse me, I wouldn't be so 
sure, if I were you.

364
00:40:12,247 --> 00:40:16,035
- What did you say?
- First time in Venice?

365
00:40:16,087 --> 00:40:19,875
- Yes, why?
- Nothing to get until September.

366
00:40:19,927 --> 00:40:24,079
- How do you know?
- I'm in that business. For years.

367
00:40:24,207 --> 00:40:27,597
Look, you see this queue?

368
00:40:28,007 --> 00:40:30,043
- So?
- So?

369
00:40:30,087 --> 00:40:34,239
What do you think these people 
are lined up for?

370
00:40:34,327 --> 00:40:38,286
They want a room too.

371
00:40:41,207 --> 00:40:45,086
- They're hard to find?
- You don't believe me?

372
00:40:45,207 --> 00:40:49,246
Here, make a call!
How much can you pay?

373
00:40:49,927 --> 00:40:53,886
Not more then 50.000 a day.

374
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:58,565
- 50.000 lire a day? In Venice?
- That's all I can pay, 50.000.

375
00:40:58,607 --> 00:41:01,599
Maybe I have what you need.

377
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:33,079
Welcome, Sir!

378
00:41:33,287 --> 00:41:34,925
Welcome?

379
00:41:34,967 --> 00:41:37,959
I take your suitcase.

380
00:41:38,007 --> 00:41:42,000
You find the way easy?
Boss explained it good?

381
00:41:42,047 --> 00:41:45,039
Map of the city,

382
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:46,645
room-key, minibar

383
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:49,520
and TV.

384
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:52,798
If you getting problems...

385
00:41:52,847 --> 00:41:55,998
This is my phone number!

386
00:41:56,567 --> 00:42:00,560
Bring with you who you like,
all inclusive.

387
00:42:00,607 --> 00:42:03,599
One week advance,

388
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:08,641
- 350.000 cash in hand.
- But this isn't a hotel.

389
00:42:09,767 --> 00:42:13,760
You change mind? No problemo.
You look for other hotel!

390
00:42:16,607 --> 00:42:18,404
Wait!

391
00:42:18,447 --> 00:42:21,245
Is breakfast included?

393
00:42:34,727 --> 00:42:38,276
- I got everything, even ginger.
- Ginger?

394
00:42:38,327 --> 00:42:41,319
- Don't you use it?
_ No.

395
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:45,326
- Got a client?
- A tax accountant.

396
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:49,326
He had a special one and 
sleeps now like a baby.

397
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:53,918
- What's that in there?
- I got an advance.

398
00:42:53,967 --> 00:42:58,006
- Knock when you're done.
- Okay, ciao.

401
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:52,003
Hallo? Pension Canaletto? I'd like 
to speak to Mrs. Rosalba Barletta.

402
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:57,880
She is not staying with you?
Strange, she left me this number.

403
00:44:57,967 --> 00:45:02,279
Maybe she checked in as Maresanto?
Okay, thank you...

404
00:45:02,527 --> 00:45:06,600
Wait! Do you have any rooms?

405
00:45:06,647 --> 00:45:10,879
Nothing before September...
Thank you. Good bye.

408
00:45:33,287 --> 00:45:35,676
Yes?

409
00:45:35,727 --> 00:45:38,878
Hi, mom. Yes.

410
00:45:39,887 --> 00:45:43,880
I just got back to the hotel.

412
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:20,885
- Good night.
- Good night to you.

414
00:46:34,967 --> 00:46:37,959
- Rosalba, you must help me.
- Me?

415
00:46:38,007 --> 00:46:42,080
I want to adopt a boy.
Give me a quick mothership lesson.

416
00:46:42,847 --> 00:46:45,839
Mothership lesson?

417
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:49,880
I never understood a thing 
about motherhood.

418
00:46:49,927 --> 00:46:52,885
Help me, please..

419
00:46:52,967 --> 00:46:56,926
- How old is the boy?
- Want to see him?

420
00:46:56,967 --> 00:46:59,606
Come on.

421
00:46:59,647 --> 00:47:01,478
Nic!

422
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:05,884
Hi, mom. Have you seen my camera?

423
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:10,036
- I put it in the drawer.
- Do you like it?

424
00:47:10,087 --> 00:47:14,080
She's on a 3 Days Trial.
I hope it works out this time.

425
00:47:14,127 --> 00:47:18,245
- Have you tried others?
- Loads.

426
00:47:18,607 --> 00:47:22,282
Even one called Vera Zasulic, 
but she was useless

427
00:47:28,487 --> 00:47:30,876
Vera...

428
00:47:32,127 --> 00:47:34,277
Vera!

429
00:47:34,327 --> 00:47:38,366
The water's boiling.

430
00:47:38,407 --> 00:47:43,276
I don't have time now,
have to finish by 6.

431
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:46,364
- They can come back later.
- No, I promised it would be ready.

432
00:47:46,407 --> 00:47:50,366
Beautyful things take time..

433
00:47:50,407 --> 00:47:54,366
Come and have your tea.

434
00:47:55,207 --> 00:47:59,564
Fermo, I'm sorry, but I hate 
to make people wait..

435
00:47:59,607 --> 00:48:03,600
You're wrong. The people have 
to learn to wait.

436
00:48:06,287 --> 00:48:10,280
What were you saying about 
the tulips before?

437
00:48:10,327 --> 00:48:14,479
Concerning tulips, contrary to 
what people think, they aren't 

438
00:48:14,527 --> 00:48:18,679
from Holland, but from Persia. The
"Arabian Nights" are full of tulips.

439
00:48:20,287 --> 00:48:24,360
Even the "Trio Lescana" knew that.
What did they sing again...

440
00:48:24,687 --> 00:48:27,679
"Tuli-Tuli-Tulipani..."

441
00:48:27,727 --> 00:48:32,084
See, you know it too. 

442
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:37,077
I'll go. No, pour the tea. 
Sit down.

443
00:48:37,127 --> 00:48:40,119
- Hello, have you made your choice?
- Yes, I'd like some Irises.

444
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:44,240
Are you a monarchist by any chance?
They were Loui's VII's emblem.

445
00:48:44,567 --> 00:48:48,526
- Are they a gift?
- Yes, for a wedding anniversary.

446
00:48:48,567 --> 00:48:52,037
Take some narcissuses or lilies then.

447
00:48:52,087 --> 00:48:56,239
Yes, but you've got irises over there.

448
00:48:57,807 --> 00:49:02,278
You take me for a mere merchant?
Are flowers here are just to suit us?

449
00:49:02,327 --> 00:49:06,286
What have irises got to do with 
anniversaries?

450
00:49:06,327 --> 00:49:10,525
"Iridacea", to call them by 
their true name.

451
00:49:10,567 --> 00:49:13,559
- Can you explain?
- I was wrong.

452
00:49:13,607 --> 00:49:17,839
Everyone's is going crazy.

453
00:49:17,887 --> 00:49:22,244
Ah, my dear, there is no more
humility in the world.

454
00:49:25,007 --> 00:49:27,999
My grandpa ate garlic too.

455
00:49:28,047 --> 00:49:32,245
- Was he an anarchist too ?
- I don't think so.

456
00:49:33,287 --> 00:49:38,281
In my family are all anarchists
and everyone has heart problems.

457
00:49:39,247 --> 00:49:43,240
- Shall we drink our tea?
- All right.

458
00:49:45,407 --> 00:49:49,400
I found him once doubled up 
on the doormat.

459
00:49:49,447 --> 00:49:53,440
- What had happened to him?
- Nothing.

460
00:49:53,487 --> 00:49:57,446
A sciatic attack. I fixed him up.

461
00:49:59,007 --> 00:50:03,239
Any idea, where he goes every
morning at 7.30?

462
00:50:03,487 --> 00:50:06,684
I don't know. Fernando is a 
mystery to me.

463
00:50:06,727 --> 00:50:10,686
When he writes all his "P"s 
and "T"s are really long.

464
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:15,360
He must be a very passionate man.

465
00:50:15,407 --> 00:50:19,798
The woman who cleans the stairs 
says he has a son.

466
00:50:19,847 --> 00:50:23,965
- A son?
- I don't know. She talks rubbish.

467
00:50:24,367 --> 00:50:27,677
Relax now...

468
00:50:33,647 --> 00:50:37,686
I was forgetting my doubts and 
scruples. Only she counted for me.

469
00:50:38,447 --> 00:50:42,884
I remember you being taller 
and gentler.

470
00:50:42,927 --> 00:50:46,886
- You missed me?
- Like a blind misses his eyes...

471
00:50:46,927 --> 00:50:49,885
Oh gosh... Do you think

472
00:50:49,967 --> 00:50:54,245
they really used to talk like that?

473
00:50:54,287 --> 00:50:58,439
Now they say, they want to 
do it under the table

474
00:50:58,487 --> 00:51:02,878
or hanging in chains on some pipes.

475
00:51:03,287 --> 00:51:06,518
- Sit down.
- No, Roger...

476
00:51:06,567 --> 00:51:10,879
- Careful, my earrings...
- Want to be dried, yes or no??

479
00:51:36,007 --> 00:51:38,077
Good evening.

480
00:51:38,327 --> 00:51:40,318
Good evening.

481
00:51:40,367 --> 00:51:44,326
"Good night" is more appropriate.

482
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:48,326
I was at Grazia's.
We fell asleep on the couch.

483
00:51:48,367 --> 00:51:53,316
I'd be lying, if I said, I 
hadn't noticed your absence.

484
00:51:59,647 --> 00:52:02,684
You're not feeling well?

485
00:52:02,727 --> 00:52:07,243
Without her appendix, I fear that
our cook isn't the same woman.

486
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:13,878
Luckily, I've never had stomach 
problems.

487
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:17,159
I'm delighted.

488
00:52:17,207 --> 00:52:20,756
Are you a musician?

489
00:52:23,007 --> 00:52:27,000
I saw the accordion in the closet.

490
00:52:27,047 --> 00:52:31,086
I was looking for a mirror.
I'm sorry.

491
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:36,566
It was a payment for a gambling 
debt, I just never sold it.

492
00:52:36,607 --> 00:52:41,317
Should I infer that you're 
capable of playing it?

493
00:52:41,607 --> 00:52:46,044
When I was 12 my granddad taught 
me as little. Then he

494
00:52:46,087 --> 00:52:49,079
fell off an unfinished bridge.

495
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:53,245
Your grandfather devoted himself 
to building bridges?

496
00:52:53,487 --> 00:52:58,083
No, one night he was cycling home
and thought the bridge was finished.

497
00:53:00,407 --> 00:53:04,480
Sometimes, distraction can be fatal.

498
00:53:05,887 --> 00:53:08,082
You're telling me.

499
00:53:20,887 --> 00:53:25,199
"In amongst all of my bits and pieces
I found these old records.

500
00:53:25,247 --> 00:53:28,284
I think, they might help you,

501
00:53:28,327 --> 00:53:32,286
to reacquire the familiarity 
with the instrument."

503
00:53:39,807 --> 00:53:43,083
I'm sorry. I don't know her.

508
00:55:25,967 --> 00:55:30,961
Yes? Good evening, Mr. Barletta.
No. No great news today either.

509
00:55:32,087 --> 00:55:35,159
7 hardwarestores, 3 hairdressers...

510
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:39,246
I got enough of your lists, 
Caponangeli!

511
00:55:39,487 --> 00:55:43,639
I wanted hard facts from you!
You know what that means?

512
00:55:43,687 --> 00:55:47,646
- So what's the delay?
- I went to the VGS...

513
00:55:47,687 --> 00:55:50,679
- Venice Graphology Society.
- What for?

514
00:55:50,727 --> 00:55:54,686
You told me she did a 
graphology course.

515
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:58,720
And a clerk at the haberdasher's
says, that his mother saw your

516
00:55:58,767 --> 00:56:02,726
wife yesterday by a hairdresser 
in Chioggia.

517
00:56:02,767 --> 00:56:06,726
This leads me to conclude, that 
your wife is no longer in Venice.

518
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:11,045
This would explain why I haven't 
found her.

519
00:56:11,087 --> 00:56:14,079
This explains that you're a 
total idiot!

520
00:56:14,127 --> 00:56:18,086
I got a postcard from her sent
3 days ago from Venice!

521
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:22,240
Yes! Despite the Italian Post!
Not of your business what it says!

522
00:56:24,287 --> 00:56:26,437
The postmark?

523
00:56:26,487 --> 00:56:28,921
It says...

524
00:56:28,967 --> 00:56:32,960
"Venice 5, Campo San Teodoro."
It's the same one.

525
00:56:33,007 --> 00:56:37,000
If you approve I'll launch plan B!

526
00:56:37,047 --> 00:56:41,040
There are 13 Boxes.
We'd need to watch them all.

527
00:56:41,087 --> 00:56:45,239
For a week at least. I could cover 
one but for the others I'd need 

528
00:56:45,647 --> 00:56:50,641
help. A small investment.
About 50.000 lire 12 times...

529
00:56:50,847 --> 00:56:53,839
- That makes for a week...
- 4.200.000.

530
00:56:53,887 --> 00:56:56,276
4.200.000.

531
00:56:56,607 --> 00:56:59,599
I've got just one thing to say:

532
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:04,084
If nothing comes up in 3 days, you
are finished with Barletta Saniplus

533
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:09,283
and every other bathroom suppliers 
on the Adriatic coast!

534
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:12,760
You jerk!

535
00:57:15,207 --> 00:57:19,246
FOr 30.000 you can find too.
That makes...

536
00:57:19,607 --> 00:57:22,246
2.520.000.

537
00:57:26,007 --> 00:57:29,841
And, how it goes? Hotel is good?

538
00:57:32,647 --> 00:57:36,640
Week is finished.
350.000 cash in hand, please.

543
00:58:40,247 --> 00:58:43,239
"Looking for a ran away dog."

546
01:00:05,087 --> 01:00:08,079
Fantastic.

547
01:00:08,807 --> 01:00:13,085
- Play something else.
- I only know a short piece.

548
01:00:13,127 --> 01:00:17,086
A short piece is fine.

551
01:01:11,247 --> 01:01:15,206
- And I pay.
- That's Mr. Fernando's glass.

552
01:01:15,727 --> 01:01:18,287
Who is Mr. Fernando?

553
01:01:18,327 --> 01:01:21,285
What's with your beard?

554
01:01:21,327 --> 01:01:25,479
I gave your coral necklace 
to Cinzia.

555
01:01:25,527 --> 01:01:28,485
That's okay.

556
01:01:28,527 --> 01:01:32,281
I win!

557
01:01:32,327 --> 01:01:37,196
- Three can't play this!
- That's what I said,

558
01:01:38,367 --> 01:01:41,359
- but they made me play it.
- Where is he going?

559
01:01:41,407 --> 01:01:45,400
To have a Thai massage, like
every night.

560
01:01:45,447 --> 01:01:49,998
Keep the deck, if you want to 
play solitaire.

561
01:01:50,047 --> 01:01:53,005
The flowers go here?

567
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:10,966
I had noodles, rice...

570
01:03:40,727 --> 01:03:44,686
- He has a son!
- Who told you?

571
01:03:44,727 --> 01:03:49,243
I followed him. He takes him to 
school and he has a boat!

572
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:55,120
- Not the son, Mr. Fernando.
- I got a client.


573
01:03:55,167 --> 01:03:57,840
- I'll come by once I'm done.
- Hurry.

574
01:04:04,647 --> 01:04:07,878
She's done already.

575
01:04:11,607 --> 01:04:14,599
Is Fernando in?

576
01:04:14,647 --> 01:04:18,606
No, he's at work.

577
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:22,037
- He's free today.
- What?

578
01:04:22,087 --> 01:04:26,046
Today's his day off. Who are you?

579
01:04:26,087 --> 01:04:30,046
I'm his guest, Rosalba Maresanto.

580
01:04:30,087 --> 01:04:33,079
I've lost the house keys. You 
know where the spares are?

581
01:04:33,127 --> 01:04:35,243
No.

582
01:04:37,287 --> 01:04:42,236
- We can look.
- Okay, let's look.

583
01:04:49,087 --> 01:04:52,238
We'll wait for him.

584
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:04,240
- What's your name?
- Eliso Sonblom

585
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:07,439
- What?
- Eliso Sonblom

586
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:10,877
It means sunflower.

587
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:15,279
He looks just like you.

588
01:05:15,327 --> 01:05:20,003
Fortunately, he didn't take after 
his father, the bastard.

590
01:05:23,567 --> 01:05:26,035
That's the door.

591
01:05:26,447 --> 01:05:28,438
Come here.

592
01:05:28,487 --> 01:05:32,446
Pst, they're here!
The mother with the son!.

593
01:05:32,487 --> 01:05:36,446
They've lost the keys and 
wait for Mr. Fernando.

594
01:05:36,487 --> 01:05:39,479
She's a friend of grandpa's.

595
01:05:39,527 --> 01:05:42,758
When is he coming back?

596
01:05:42,807 --> 01:05:46,800.
Hello, I'm the neighbour.
Grazia Reginella,

597
01:05:46,847 --> 01:05:49,805
holistic beautycian and masseuse.

598
01:05:49,847 --> 01:05:53,806
Adele, skilled worker. 

599
01:05:53,847 --> 01:05:57,556
- He's Eliseo.
- Hey!

600
01:05:57,607 --> 01:06:01,077
Mama, I'm hungry.

601
01:06:03,287 --> 01:06:07,599
Then my father died too.
He worked in a refinery.

602
01:06:07,647 --> 01:06:11,037
- Then he got cancer.
- How old were you?

603
01:06:11,087 --> 01:06:14,477
- Fifteen.
- How did you managed it alone?

604
01:06:14,527 --> 01:06:19,282
They put me to an aunt in Pordenone.
It was the shittiest time of my life.

605
01:06:19,567 --> 01:06:23,685
Her breath reeked of carbolic acid.
I ran away six times!

606
01:06:23,927 --> 01:06:27,203
When I met him, I thought, 
the bad times were over.

607
01:06:27,247 --> 01:06:31,445
He told me, that he loved me.

608
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:33,955
As for me...

609
01:06:34,007 --> 01:06:37,204
I was crazy about him.

610
01:06:37,247 --> 01:06:40,284
Then I got pregnant.

611
01:06:40,327 --> 01:06:44,286
What did he do?

612
01:06:44,327 --> 01:06:48,366
Listen, before I gave birth,
he was screwing another woman.

613
01:06:48,407 --> 01:06:52,958
- I don't belive it!
- Nothing shocks me anymore.

614
01:06:53,887 --> 01:06:57,846
After you gave birth he 
surely has changed?

615
01:06:57,887 --> 01:07:01,846
Like hell! He gambled away the 
money for the stroller!

616
01:07:01,887 --> 01:07:05,562
That's terrible!

619
01:07:19,647 --> 01:07:21,956
Fernando?

620
01:07:23,887 --> 01:07:28,324
- Mrs. Rosalba, can you explain?
- What could I do, throw them out?

621
01:07:28,367 --> 01:07:32,360
They've lost their keys,
the boy was tired and

622
01:07:32,407 --> 01:07:36,400
I let them sleep in your bed.

623
01:07:36,447 --> 01:07:40,884
I didn't comprehend your resentment,
nor the reason why you followed me.

624
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:45,955
One thing above all has 
surprised and upset me...

625
01:07:52,967 --> 01:07:55,686
This unpleasant discovery.

626
01:07:59,447 --> 01:08:03,725
They forgot me at a diner.

627
01:08:03,767 --> 01:08:08,716
I'd be obliged, if you could provide 
a more concrete explanation.

628
01:08:09,487 --> 01:08:14,277
I'm married, with two sons.
We were on a trip to Paestum.

629
01:08:14,367 --> 01:08:18,883
When they saw I wasn't on the bus,
they called and told me to wait.

630
01:08:20,287 --> 01:08:24,405
But I didn't. I wanted to go home, so

631
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:28,725
I hitchhiked and the last car 
was going to Venice.

632
01:08:29,087 --> 01:08:32,079
I'd never been here.

633
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:36,086
Why not return to your
family nucleus now?

634
01:08:36,167 --> 01:08:40,160
My family nucleus? You're a 
fine one to talk like that.

635
01:08:40,207 --> 01:08:44,246
Did you ever examine your own 
family situation?

636
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:49,240
Don't think I do not feel the 
weight of my misdeeds.

637
01:08:50,687 --> 01:08:54,646
Especially regarding my son.

638
01:08:54,687 --> 01:08:59,283
Unfortunately Alan is making the 
same mistakes with Eliseo

639
01:08:59,407 --> 01:09:04,117
- which I did with him.
- Alan?

640
01:09:04,167 --> 01:09:08,240
Yes. In those days my wife was 
a big admirer of Alan Sorrenti.

641
01:09:10,807 --> 01:09:14,800
Now when you'll excuse me.

642
01:09:18,247 --> 01:09:22,240
Oh my gosh, I've put my foot 
in it again.

643
01:09:30,527 --> 01:09:34,645
Fernando, please forgive me.
Sometimes I speak without thinking.

644
01:09:34,687 --> 01:09:38,726
I must admit, my trust in 
you did waver.

645
01:09:38,767 --> 01:09:43,397
There again, I kept silent
about the blemish in my past.

646
01:09:43,447 --> 01:09:48,282
- Which one?
- I appreciate your tact, but 

647
01:09:48,527 --> 01:09:50,279
- years in jail leave a mark.
- Jail?

648
01:09:50,327 --> 01:09:54,639
I infer, that Adele omitted that Detail.

649
01:09:54,687 --> 01:09:59,044
Yes, she omitted it. What had you done?

650
01:09:59,087 --> 01:10:03,046
I plunged a blade into a man's belly.

651
01:10:03,087 --> 01:10:07,239
He was a good friend, but I 
caught him in bed with my wife.

652
01:10:09,287 --> 01:10:13,280
I understand your unease, but back
then I was young and uncapable,

653
01:10:13,327 --> 01:10:16,364
to control my emotions. Yes.

654
01:10:16,407 --> 01:10:20,844
If you find it opportune 
to seek other lodgings,

655
01:10:20,887 --> 01:10:24,721
I wouldn't blame you.

656
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:28,282
- I have to confess that...
- Where the hell are the keys?


657
01:10:29,327 --> 01:10:33,878
- In the meter box.
- Give them to me so we can go.

658
01:10:34,687 --> 01:10:38,202
That's not a suitable idea.

659
01:10:38,247 --> 01:10:41,284
So? Let's hear yours then.

660
01:10:41,327 --> 01:10:45,684
Go back to bed. I'll wake you
up in time tomorrow morning.

661
01:10:50,687 --> 01:10:55,078
Her appearance goes against her,
but she's quite a sensitive girl.

662
01:10:55,447 --> 01:10:59,281
- Where is Alan now?
- In Oslo.

664
01:11:04,127 --> 01:11:06,880
Yes, please? Who is this?

665
01:11:08,527 --> 01:11:11,883
Mrs. Barletta! Yes. 
Good evening...morning.

666
01:11:11,927 --> 01:11:15,806
Why are you looking for me?
Is there a problem at home?

667
01:11:15,847 --> 01:11:19,806
- Yes and no.
- What do you mean?

668
01:11:19,847 --> 01:11:23,806
- Should I be worried?
- The time's come for us to meet.

669
01:11:23,847 --> 01:11:27,806
- Tell me when and where.
- Why do we have to meet?

670
01:11:27,847 --> 01:11:30,839
I have information that concerns you.

671
01:11:30,887 --> 01:11:34,846
Okay, meet me tomorrow morning 
at 8 on Campo da Pozzi.

672
01:11:34,887 --> 01:11:38,800
Campo da Pozzi, I'll be there at 8.
Perfekt. Good n... morning

673
01:11:39,927 --> 01:11:42,236
Good night.

674
01:11:44,807 --> 01:11:48,083
I found her!

675
01:11:48,687 --> 01:11:51,884
I found her...
677
01:12:27,047 --> 01:12:31,245
- Is it you?
- How do you do?

678
01:12:32,367 --> 01:12:36,280
Angelo Costantin of the TTD,
private detektive.

679
01:12:36,327 --> 01:12:40,684
- What has happened?
- I should be asking you the same.

680
01:12:40,727 --> 01:12:44,879
- What do you mean?
- You vanished without a word.

681
01:12:45,207 --> 01:12:49,200
- Your husband is in the bad way.
- Did he send you?

682
01:12:49,247 --> 01:12:53,399
- Of course!
- Then nothing is wrong.

683
01:12:53,447 --> 01:12:57,440
No? Mrs. you don't realize:
Your husband can't sleep or eat.

684
01:12:57,487 --> 01:13:02,436
- Aren't you bothered?
- What do you care?

685
01:13:02,487 --> 01:13:07,277
I care, believe me, I care!
You've no idea. Come back with me

686
01:13:07,807 --> 01:13:12,005
or your husband could do 
something drastic.

687
01:13:14,647 --> 01:13:17,366
- Yes? Excuse me. please.
- Tino, guess what Sylvia is doing

688
01:13:17,407 --> 01:13:21,366
- for Santina's wedding shower:
- Mama, this is no time for riddles.

689
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:26,276
- Little angels out of bread dough!
- Mama, can we talk later?

690
01:13:27,527 --> 01:13:31,759
Mama, please, I can't talk now!

694
01:14:14,727 --> 01:14:19,278
If you want to give me a heart 
attack, carry on like that.

695
01:14:19,527 --> 01:14:23,884
Can you see, if there's a man 
outside in a trench coat and a hat?

697
01:14:46,847 --> 01:14:51,443
Vera, remember: Freedom is 
an invioable right.

698
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:56,277
No one can force you to 
go against your will.

699
01:14:56,327 --> 01:15:00,286
I have to do Mr. Battistini's 
wreath now.

700
01:15:00,367 --> 01:15:04,280
Wait, there's something I have to say.
I've been thinking about it all night.

701
01:15:04,687 --> 01:15:08,839
How does that waltz go?
Or was it a russian melody?

702
01:15:08,887 --> 01:15:13,278
Shall I play it again?

704
01:15:16,847 --> 01:15:20,157
Mr. Barletta. I found her!

705
01:15:20,207 --> 01:15:23,643
She plays accordion at a florist's

706
01:15:23,687 --> 01:15:28,078
on the Campiello dei Miracoli.
Of course I'm sure. Listen!

707
01:15:36,927 --> 01:15:41,079
Yes, and I have one of her shoes
Size 8 1/2?

708
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:53,238
See you tomorrow!

712
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:05,280
- Can I help you?
- Yes... no! They told me...

713
01:17:08,287 --> 01:17:12,280
Oh, right... You're Diego's friend.

714
01:17:13,287 --> 01:17:17,280
Then you're looking for me.
Glad to meet you! Grazia Reginella.

715
01:17:19,007 --> 01:17:22,966
And you are... Vittorio, am I right?

716
01:17:23,007 --> 01:17:24,998
Mmmh... Vittorio.

717
01:17:25,047 --> 01:17:28,278
Yes, Vittorio Alfieri. Very glad.

718
01:17:28,327 --> 01:17:32,286
Don't be surprised. I've got 
good memory for names.

719
01:17:38,647 --> 01:17:42,276
Get undressed. I'll be right with you.

720
01:17:48,527 --> 01:17:51,963
- My pants too?
- Of course.

721
01:17:52,007 --> 01:17:54,282
Glasses and watch as well.

722
01:17:54,327 --> 01:17:58,764
Diego said, you have problems 
in your lumbar region, right?

723
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:01,799
Ahh...yes. That's the place.

724
01:18:19,287 --> 01:18:22,279
Lie down.

726
01:18:45,127 --> 01:18:49,166
- You've been living here longer?
- Two years. Why?

727
01:18:50,607 --> 01:18:54,759
Just a question. By the way...

728
01:18:55,447 --> 01:18:58,439
How many people live here?

729
01:18:58,487 --> 01:19:02,162
I've no idea.

730
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:05,643
You're very tense.

731
01:19:05,687 --> 01:19:09,282
- What job do you do?
- I'm a plumber.

732
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:13,161
Oh! Fantastic!

734
01:19:24,487 --> 01:19:27,524
Y'know many people on the building?

735
01:19:27,567 --> 01:19:31,640
What is this, a market research?
Relax.

736
01:19:38,687 --> 01:19:41,679
Tell me, you know if anyone

737
01:19:42,487 --> 01:19:47,163
has rented an appartment recently?

739
01:19:54,207 --> 01:19:58,246
- What's that?
- My mobile phone.

740
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:03,286
Yes? Ah, Mr. Barletta.

741
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:07,479
I'll call you back. Things are 
a little... delicate right now.

742
01:20:08,567 --> 01:20:12,242
Good Bye.

743
01:20:13,287 --> 01:20:15,278
Delicate?

744
01:20:16,767 --> 01:20:19,235
Why?

745
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:34,360
It's not his son, it's his 
grandson! His son is in Oslo.

746
01:20:34,407 --> 01:20:38,685
And there is a detective,
sent to me... What's wrong?

747
01:20:39,007 --> 01:20:43,239
Nothing... a new client. Sorry.
I'll be around once I'm done.

749
01:20:54,247 --> 01:20:56,681
Oh my gosh!

750
01:21:05,007 --> 01:21:07,237
Fernando!

751
01:21:07,487 --> 01:21:12,083
Mrs. Rosalba, recent events
seem to have been tumultuous.

752
01:21:12,687 --> 01:21:17,078
My face is looking from all walls.

753
01:21:23,287 --> 01:21:27,644
There is a detective from the DDT.
My husband sent him.

754
01:21:28,087 --> 01:21:32,239
I shook him off, but I'm scared
people will recognize me.

755
01:21:32,367 --> 01:21:35,439
It would seem your husband is not 

756
01:21:35,487 --> 01:21:39,878
a deep connoisseur of your soul.

757
01:21:39,927 --> 01:21:44,079
Here you have nothing to fear.

758
01:21:45,407 --> 01:21:50,083
I suggest you try the work
of our new cook.

759
01:21:50,287 --> 01:21:54,326
The venetian-style liver is 
a genuine delight.

760
01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:58,280
You could wash it down with 
a vintage red.

761
01:22:00,767 --> 01:22:04,760
I don't want to go home tonight.

762
01:22:07,087 --> 01:22:11,683
I know a dance hall near from here.
If I interprete your desires right?

763
01:22:14,287 --> 01:22:17,279
Interpretation correct.

764
01:22:18,647 --> 01:22:21,286
Please, this way.

766
01:22:32,807 --> 01:22:37,756
"About the forest roved the count,
and as the break of day was brought.

767
01:22:37,967 --> 01:22:41,960
By unhappy fortune to the fount,

768
01:22:42,007 --> 01:22:45,238
where his enscription
young Medoro wrote.

769
01:22:45,407 --> 01:22:49,685
To see his wrongs inscribed upon 
that mount, inflamed his fury so,

770
01:22:49,887 --> 01:22:54,085
in him was naught. But turned 
to hatred, frenzy, rage and spite.

771
01:22:54,767 --> 01:22:59,158
He cleft throught the writing
and the solid block,

772
01:22:59,247 --> 01:23:03,286
into the sky in tiny 
fragmens sped.

773
01:23:03,327 --> 01:23:07,684
Woe to each sappling and carvened rock
where  Medor und Angelica were read.

774
01:23:09,847 --> 01:23:13,237
So scathed, that they......"

775
01:23:14,727 --> 01:23:18,686
I'm afraid, my memory is 
starting to falter.

776
01:23:18,767 --> 01:23:23,682
- Do you know it all by heart?
- Up to Orlando's recovery.

777
01:23:23,927 --> 01:23:28,079
Once I was freed from jail, 
I planned to finish,

778
01:23:28,447 --> 01:23:32,440
but fate decided otherwise..
I'am a waiter now.

779
01:23:32,487 --> 01:23:35,479
- But I used to be a singer before.
- A singer?

780
01:23:35,527 --> 01:23:39,679
On cruise ships. And that man
was my rolemodel.

782
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:56,281
- Why did you stop?
- That's the way it went.

786
01:25:00,047 --> 01:25:04,245
- "They toil on..."
- "They toiled on."

787
01:25:04,807 --> 01:25:09,244
"They toliled on and torrents 
ran." And?

788
01:25:09,527 --> 01:25:13,486
"And, what may some 
diversion interpose,

789
01:25:13,527 --> 01:25:17,406
Sweet subjects of discourse scan

790
01:25:17,447 --> 01:25:20,280
in conference which might 
have appear.

791
01:25:21,287 --> 01:25:25,280
The rugged road less 
dismal and severe."

792
01:25:29,047 --> 01:25:32,039
It's for you.

793
01:25:32,087 --> 01:25:36,046
"Where have you been?
I have to talk to you.

794
01:25:36,087 --> 01:25:40,046
Come anytime."
I'll go and see what's happened.

795
01:25:47,967 --> 01:25:52,040
At last. Where were you?
I'm dying to tell you.

796
01:25:52,127 --> 01:25:55,039
Tell me what?

797
01:25:57,287 --> 01:26:01,963
Look, he even mended my pipe!
Do you believe in coincidence?

798
01:26:02,007 --> 01:26:06,046
He's a plumber! That's fantastic

799
01:26:06,087 --> 01:26:10,046
- Do you know his name? 
- Vittorio! Isn't that fantastic?

800
01:26:10,407 --> 01:26:15,037
He has magic hands. When he 
touches me, I catch fire!

801
01:26:16,167 --> 01:26:19,284
Where have you put him?

802
01:26:19,327 --> 01:26:22,046
In my bed.

803
01:26:28,087 --> 01:26:31,523
Look, he's so cute.

804
01:26:31,567 --> 01:26:35,242
He's sleeping like a baby.

805
01:26:36,367 --> 01:26:41,043
- That face seems familiar.
- I know what you mean.

806
01:26:41,727 --> 01:26:45,720
I thought the same thing.
What an angel...

807
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:48,839
- Holy mother of god! It's him!
- Psst, you'll wake him up.

808
01:26:48,887 --> 01:26:52,846
- It's him.
- Not so loud. Who?

809
01:26:52,887 --> 01:26:56,880
The detective my husband sent!

810
01:26:56,927 --> 01:27:01,045
Are you crazy? He's a friend 
of Diego. Vittorio the plumber.

811
01:27:01,087 --> 01:27:05,080
I met him today. He's following 
me. Constantin! That's his name.

812
01:27:05,127 --> 01:27:09,166
- Where are his clothes?
- What are you doing?

813
01:27:10,287 --> 01:27:13,643
Look, he had them on this morning.

814
01:27:13,687 --> 01:27:17,202
- What now?
- I'm looking for his papers.

815
01:27:17,247 --> 01:27:21,240
- No, what if he wakes up?
- He won't, he's sleeping.

816
01:27:23,287 --> 01:27:27,280
- Caponangeli, Costantino Maria.
- He told me, it was Costantin.

817
01:27:27,327 --> 01:27:30,717
Via Vittorio Alfieri Nr. 7.
Pescara.

818
01:27:30,767 --> 01:27:34,726
- Do you believe me now?
- Profession: plumber

819
01:27:34,767 --> 01:27:38,646
Oh, no, I ditched the other one.

820
01:27:38,687 --> 01:27:43,715
Mrs. Rosalba. With you on accordion, 
I could perform once more.

821
01:27:43,887 --> 01:27:46,879
- He's an impostor.
- Who?

822
01:27:46,927 --> 01:27:50,886
In Grazia's bed there's a
detective, my man has engaged.

823
01:27:50,927 --> 01:27:53,919
- But he's really a plumber.
- Oh my gosh...

825
01:28:04,607 --> 01:28:09,078
It belonged to my wife's grandfather.
It was last fired at Caporetto,

826
01:28:10,287 --> 01:28:14,519
but it has been perfectly preserved

827
01:28:14,567 --> 01:28:18,526
from the perils of rust
and the wear of time.

828
01:28:18,567 --> 01:28:23,004
If I were you, I'd avoid doing 
anything to impel me

829
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:27,086
to demonstrate the efficiency 
of its working.

830
01:28:27,287 --> 01:28:31,883
- What did you say?
- I've always had lousy luck.

831
01:28:31,927 --> 01:28:36,079
From the start. My first kiss
was in a cemetery!

832
01:28:36,287 --> 01:28:40,121
I was fifteen. We used to go 
there to smoke Joints.

833
01:28:40,167 --> 01:28:44,160
His name was even Primo!
This must be a coincidence!

834
01:28:44,207 --> 01:28:47,199
The first one always leaves the mark.

835
01:28:47,247 --> 01:28:51,081
He dumped me overnight for a girl, 

836
01:28:51,367 --> 01:28:55,883
- who did the weather report on TV!
- He wasn't right for you.

837
01:28:55,927 --> 01:29:00,239
And Ettore? He seemed so much 
in love! We went to Greece.

838
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:05,245
First evening I found him on the
ferry kissin a sailor from Saloniki.

839
01:29:06,527 --> 01:29:10,281
I wanted no more serious relationships.

840
01:29:10,527 --> 01:29:14,281
But then I met Corrado!
Light it up for me, please.

841
01:29:14,527 --> 01:29:17,519
Love on the first sight.

842
01:29:17,567 --> 01:29:21,560
I'd have followed him to Alaska,
but he was from Chioggia,

843
01:29:21,607 --> 01:29:25,600
so I went to Chioggia instead.
After a year I found out, that

844
01:29:25,647 --> 01:29:29,720
he had 2 women - two kids with 
one and three with the other...

845
01:29:29,767 --> 01:29:33,885
- He wasn't even a Muslim!
- You were better off without him.

846
01:29:36,527 --> 01:29:40,884
Grazia, I lied to you. I'm 
Costantino Caponangeli, plumber 

847
01:29:40,967 --> 01:29:45,245
from Pescara. Mrs. Barletta's
husband hired me as detective.

848
01:29:46,087 --> 01:29:50,239
He has a bathrom company 
and I needed work!

849
01:29:50,287 --> 01:29:54,280
It was my big chance.
Grazia, look at me.

850
01:30:01,047 --> 01:30:05,245
I spent the best moments 
of my live with you.

851
01:30:05,287 --> 01:30:09,280
I knew, you had to be somewhere
and finally I've found you.

852
01:30:09,327 --> 01:30:13,286
I know now what happiness is.

853
01:30:14,167 --> 01:30:18,206
Believe me, I beseech you.

854
01:30:18,247 --> 01:30:22,240
How can I, after what has happened?

855
01:30:23,047 --> 01:30:27,245
Hand me over my mobile phone.
It's just there.

856
01:30:30,887 --> 01:30:32,878
Thank you.

857
01:30:40,047 --> 01:30:44,006
Hello, Mr.Barletta?
No, I don't know the time.

858
01:30:44,047 --> 01:30:48,245
I was wrong, she wasn't your wife.
She doesn't work for a florist

859
01:30:48,287 --> 01:30:52,280
or play accordion for him.
Yes, I'm crazy.

860
01:30:52,327 --> 01:30:56,684
Hire someone else to do it.
Throw it away.

861
01:31:12,087 --> 01:31:16,877
One has to admit, that the last 
few hours were full of emotions.

862
01:31:19,287 --> 01:31:24,236
- May I offer you a nightcap?
- No, everything's spinning.

863
01:31:39,847 --> 01:31:42,236
Fernando.

864
01:31:43,767 --> 01:31:47,726
The last time I danced was 
nine years ago.

865
01:31:47,767 --> 01:31:51,646
- On my brother's wedding.
- I'm most honored then.

866
01:31:51,687 --> 01:31:55,646
I felt like flying.

867
01:31:56,087 --> 01:32:00,080
Me too, I felt like a phoenix
rising from its ashes.

869
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:09,877
Good night.

870
01:32:14,527 --> 01:32:16,404
Rosalba?

871
01:32:16,447 --> 01:32:18,642
Yes?

872
01:32:26,447 --> 01:32:31,077
Sunday is Eliseo's birthday.
I'd be glad, if you joined us.

873
01:32:34,447 --> 01:32:37,086
I'd love to...

876
01:34:16,487 --> 01:34:19,081
Bravo!

879
01:34:42,527 --> 01:34:46,998
- Vera, have you brought my boots?
- I put them by the stove.

880
01:34:47,247 --> 01:34:50,603
They're not there.

881
01:34:50,647 --> 01:34:54,879
- Want me to come look?
- No, I've got them now.

883
01:34:59,087 --> 01:35:02,636
Rosi, what are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

884
01:35:02,687 --> 01:35:04,279
Why?

885
01:35:04,327 --> 01:35:08,286
- What are you doing here?
- Moving the camellias.

886
01:35:08,327 --> 01:35:12,878
You're wrecking your family.

887
01:35:16,087 --> 01:35:19,796
- Stop it...
- You're real?

888
01:35:19,847 --> 01:35:23,840
- Whaddaya think? I'm plastic?
- The lady can't decide?

889
01:35:23,887 --> 01:35:27,880
A special occasion or an 
act of politeness?

890
01:35:27,927 --> 01:35:30,919
An act of madness, more like that.

891
01:35:30,967 --> 01:35:34,880
What would you call a woman, who 
lives her family without a reason?

892
01:35:34,967 --> 01:35:39,404
- That's not true!
- To appeal to atternal love

893
01:35:39,447 --> 01:35:42,644
geraniums are ideal. 
The're over there.

894
01:35:42,687 --> 01:35:46,885
If they're not enough I have 
more out in the back.

895
01:35:50,647 --> 01:35:53,639
Your son Nic takes drugs.

896
01:35:53,687 --> 01:35:55,439
Shit!

897
01:36:07,047 --> 01:36:10,039
"I'm an unworthy mother.

898
01:36:10,087 --> 01:36:14,080
I'm going back to my family 
and my obligations.

899
01:36:14,127 --> 01:36:18,245
My warmest thanks for everything 
you've done for me.

900
01:36:20,167 --> 01:36:23,239
Good bye. Rosalba."

902
01:36:36,487 --> 01:36:38,637
Hello!

904
01:36:52,487 --> 01:36:54,079
Mom!

905
01:36:54,127 --> 01:36:57,119
Nic! Hello!

906
01:36:57,167 --> 01:36:59,317
Why is everything so neat?

907
01:36:59,367 --> 01:37:03,360
- It was dad.
- On his own?

908
01:37:03,407 --> 01:37:07,525
No, he called "Splendor".
It took them two days.

909
01:37:07,567 --> 01:37:10,559
Your vacation is over?

910
01:37:10,607 --> 01:37:13,280
Yes, it is.

911
01:37:16,287 --> 01:37:19,324
Is it true, that you take drugs?

912
01:37:19,367 --> 01:37:23,679
- Who told you?
- Aunt Ketty.

913
01:37:24,287 --> 01:37:27,518
Mom, joints aren't drugs.

914
01:37:27,567 --> 01:37:31,276
- So what are they?
- Joints.

915
01:37:34,127 --> 01:37:37,244
Pour me a glass.

916
01:37:39,087 --> 01:37:43,603
Now all the people who own Freon 
ones have to ditch them.

917
01:37:43,647 --> 01:37:46,115
The same goes for fluorocarbon.

918
01:37:46,167 --> 01:37:50,399
They have to buy conditioners,
with that other new Gas...

919
01:37:50,447 --> 01:37:53,405
- With HRC.
- Right!

920
01:37:53,447 --> 01:37:57,884
The standartized ecological conditioner.
Fortunately heat doesn't bother me.

921
01:37:58,087 --> 01:38:02,399
You're kidding! Last year on the 
beach you haven't stopped the fan.

922
01:38:04,247 --> 01:38:06,203
Very funny...

923
01:38:06,247 --> 01:38:10,240
Did you show mom, what your 
Italian teacher wrote?

924
01:38:10,687 --> 01:38:15,158
- Go ahead.
- What's happened?

925
01:38:15,247 --> 01:38:19,160
- I'm paying for private lessons...
- Need your car tonight?

926
01:38:19,287 --> 01:38:23,280
- Where are you going?
- There's a new club opening.

927
01:38:23,327 --> 01:38:27,320
Cinzia's cousin runs the bar.
We can drink for free.

928
01:38:27,367 --> 01:38:31,326
Can't he pump gas instead?
You always empty the tank. 

929
01:38:31,367 --> 01:38:35,360
They siphon it out with a tube.
Stop hanging out with those misfits.

930
01:38:35,407 --> 01:38:39,400
What's this about the tube?

931
01:38:39,447 --> 01:38:42,484
Nothing, Papa. Forget it.

932
01:38:58,887 --> 01:39:03,165
- Mimmo, I wanted to tell you...
- Alba, listen.

933
01:39:03,567 --> 01:39:07,276
As far as I'm concerned,
nothing happened.

937
01:40:01,927 --> 01:40:06,876
Grazia asks, if you'd like to eat
with us. We've ordered from Chinese.

938
01:40:15,007 --> 01:40:19,683
Fernando, pull yourself together.
You can't spend the whole day moping.

939
01:40:20,607 --> 01:40:25,078
It happens to be my day off.

940
01:40:27,727 --> 01:40:32,084
- Yes, but not a day of fasting.
- Sorry, I'm not hungry at all.

942
01:40:52,407 --> 01:40:56,878
How about a quick game of 
darts then, Fernando?

943
01:40:59,807 --> 01:41:03,720
- Grandpa, what's bothering you?
- Nothing, Eliseo.

944
01:41:03,767 --> 01:41:08,283
"Your words sound obscure, but
one day I'll understand."

945
01:41:08,327 --> 01:41:12,286
- You always say that.
- I'm bothered by my own folly.

946
01:41:12,327 --> 01:41:16,684
Once again happiness knocked 
on my door in vain.

947
01:41:18,967 --> 01:41:22,676
Why didn't you answer?

948
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:27,286
I was deaf and now I languish.

950
01:42:16,967 --> 01:42:20,880
It's a mistake! Andrea, please,
give me permission to see him!

951
01:42:20,967 --> 01:42:23,959
- Try to forget him
- I can't and I won't.

952
01:42:24,007 --> 01:42:28,080
Juan's my husband.
What if he weren't?

953
01:42:28,887 --> 01:42:32,482
What do you mean?
He is my husband!

954
01:42:32,527 --> 01:42:34,882
Don't ask me to help him.

955
01:42:43,967 --> 01:42:46,959
I wanted to kill him...

956
01:42:47,007 --> 01:42:50,966
Rosalba! Have you forgotten us?

957
01:42:51,607 --> 01:42:55,600
- No.
- When will you be back?

958
01:42:56,287 --> 01:42:59,962
My life is here.

959
01:43:04,647 --> 01:43:08,083
Fernando, Rosalba is
waiting for you.

960
01:43:09,287 --> 01:43:12,359
What engenders such certainty?

961
01:43:12,407 --> 01:43:15,399
My female intuition.

964
01:43:59,527 --> 01:44:03,076
You are Fermo.

965
01:44:03,367 --> 01:44:06,359
And you're Narcissus.

966
01:44:06,407 --> 01:44:09,285
Fernando Girasol.

967
01:44:09,327 --> 01:44:13,764
I'm the owner of the accordion
Mrs. Rosalba played.

968
01:44:13,807 --> 01:44:17,766
I realized that.
Have you brought me news?

969
01:44:17,807 --> 01:44:21,277
I've brought the instrument 
as a pledge. In return

970
01:44:21,327 --> 01:44:25,718
I'd like to ask you for your van.
I know you possess an exemplar

971
01:44:25,767 --> 01:44:29,965
for deliveries to a company 
on the mainland.

972
01:44:30,567 --> 01:44:33,604
Get to the point.

973
01:44:33,647 --> 01:44:38,277
I intend to descend to the Abruzzi
and bring Rosalba back here.

974
01:44:38,647 --> 01:44:42,959
Two companions are joining 
me on this quest.

975
01:44:48,287 --> 01:44:52,280
It hasn't seen a freeway in 20 years.
Change the oil, pump up the tires...

976
01:44:52,327 --> 01:44:54,921
and respect its age.

978
01:45:15,847 --> 01:45:19,044
But... why are you here?

979
01:45:19,087 --> 01:45:22,204
I want to quit school.

980
01:45:22,247 --> 01:45:25,284
What is this idea?

981
01:45:25,327 --> 01:45:28,285
It's not an idea. Everything sucks.

982
01:45:28,327 --> 01:45:31,637
So, everything sucks?

983
01:45:31,687 --> 01:45:35,999
You know I stopped studying
and went to work for your uncle?

984
01:45:36,047 --> 01:45:40,040
- And?
- I regret it now.

985
01:45:40,287 --> 01:45:44,280
You all say that.

986
01:45:45,367 --> 01:45:49,042
Come to the supermarket with me.

987
01:45:49,087 --> 01:45:52,921
You know "Orlando Furioso"?

988
01:45:53,007 --> 01:45:57,205
The guy who hoes nuts and his
brain blasts over the moon?

989
01:45:57,247 --> 01:46:00,284
It's not quite like that.

990
01:46:00,327 --> 01:46:04,400
- What would you like to do now?
- I don't know.

991
01:46:04,447 --> 01:46:07,996
What? There must be something
you like.

992
01:46:08,047 --> 01:46:12,120
- How many people do what they like?
- Your father does.

993
01:46:12,167 --> 01:46:16,240
Can you see me selling toilets 
and windows for the next 40 years?

994
01:46:37,287 --> 01:46:41,963
Rosalba. Since you went 
life is a pain.

995
01:46:42,007 --> 01:46:46,000
The nights are torment,
the days are harsh.

996
01:46:46,047 --> 01:46:50,723
If I've made this journey then 
for one reason 'tis owed.

997
01:46:50,767 --> 01:46:54,760
That you'll return to 
light up my abode.

998
01:46:54,807 --> 01:46:56,798
Fernando.

999
01:46:56,847 --> 01:47:00,806
What a surprise. You take me unaware.

1000
01:47:00,847 --> 01:47:04,806
You're busy with your buys 
and caught up in your cares.

1001
01:47:09,767 --> 01:47:13,806
This is my son Nicola.
And... this is Mr. Fernando.

1002
01:47:14,287 --> 01:47:18,405
I realize, that the situation 
may seem bizarre for you.

1003
01:47:18,447 --> 01:47:22,440
Nevertheless I've come to 
lay claim to your mother.

1004
01:47:22,487 --> 01:47:24,762
Abd why?

1005
01:47:24,807 --> 01:47:26,923
Because...

1006
01:47:26,967 --> 01:47:29,606
I love her.

1008
01:47:44,407 --> 01:47:48,195
Soul of my sorrowful life

1009
01:47:48,247 --> 01:47:52,240
beneath this colorless sky.

1010
01:47:52,487 --> 01:47:56,082
Let me live in peace

1011
01:47:56,127 --> 01:48:00,245
without bitterness or pain.

1012
01:48:00,367 --> 01:48:04,042
Far from my emotions

1013
01:48:04,087 --> 01:48:08,239
I wish only to sleep.

1014
01:48:08,407 --> 01:48:12,366
A nest of peaceful silence,

1015
01:48:12,407 --> 01:48:16,446
is my natural refuge.

1016
01:48:16,487 --> 01:48:20,275
The look in your eyes makes
me tremble,

1017
01:48:20,327 --> 01:48:24,115
the lost voice of your heart,

1018
01:48:24,167 --> 01:48:28,046
is a defeat of all my illusions.

1019
01:48:28,087 --> 01:48:32,126
The fresh dew on jasmine.

1020
01:48:32,567 --> 01:48:36,355
Your lips as sweet as honey.

1021
01:48:36,407 --> 01:48:39,683
Pink like roses, carminred
like carnation.

1022
01:48:40,167 --> 01:48:43,239
For you I return to my dreams,

1023
01:48:43,927 --> 01:48:47,078
I won't hide anymore.

1024
01:48:48,527 --> 01:48:51,087
May I have this dance, Mrs.?

1026
01:49:17,927 --> 01:49:20,839
I don't wish to seem impetuous

1027
01:49:20,887 --> 01:49:24,084
but can't we drop "Mr. and Mrs."?
