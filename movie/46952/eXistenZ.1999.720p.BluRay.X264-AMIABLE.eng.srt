eXistenZ.

3
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:30,699
Written like this.

4
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:31,742
One word.

5
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,621
Small "e."
Capital "X."

6
00:03:35,955 --> 00:03:37,248
Capital "Z."

7
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,458
eXistenZ.

8
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,753
It's new.
lt's from Antenna Research.

9
00:03:42,962 --> 00:03:44,130
And it's here.

10
00:03:44,505 --> 00:03:45,881
Right now.

11
00:03:46,882 --> 00:03:49,843
We encourage consumer loyalty,
and we want you to help...

12
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:53,681
...with our product testing.
We're a team. Antenna and you.

13
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:57,184
Those of you who've come
to our seminars before...

14
00:03:57,435 --> 00:04:00,937
...will know that l normally lead
the groups through our new games.

15
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:02,815
But tonight it won't be me.

16
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:04,442
No.

17
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:08,654
For our test launch
of eXistenZ, by Antenna...

18
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:11,740
...we've brought you
a seminar leader who's special.

19
00:04:13,993 --> 00:04:14,951
Yes, it is.

20
00:04:15,994 --> 00:04:19,081
The world's greatest
game designer is here...

21
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:22,625
...in person, to lead you,
our first test enclave...

22
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:27,005
...through her newest creation,
eXistenZ, by Antenna.

23
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:30,467
I give you the game-pod
goddess herself...

24
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:32,385
...Allegra Geller.

25
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:49,277
Allegra! Allegra!

26
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,414
The world of games
is in a kind of a trance.

27
00:05:02,457 --> 00:05:06,753
People are programmed
to accept so little.

28
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,217
But the possibilities are so great.

29
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:18,473
eXistenZ is not just a game.

30
00:05:21,475 --> 00:05:23,394
It's an entirely new game system.

31
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:25,813
And...

32
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:30,609
...it involves a whole lot
of new toys...

33
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:33,696
...which you're gonna be
the first to try out.

34
00:05:45,874 --> 00:05:49,169
We have 1 2 prototype
MetaFlesh Game-Pods.

35
00:05:49,378 --> 00:05:54,174
That means that for our first-wave
test enclave, we need 1 2 volunteers...

36
00:05:54,383 --> 00:05:58,679
...who will port into these slave units
with the game-pod goddess herself.

37
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:01,432
Hold it.

38
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,641
Not so fast.

39
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,143
Right.

40
00:06:06,812 --> 00:06:08,564
Did l miss the port-in?

41
00:06:08,814 --> 00:06:11,399
Just the first wave.
You can be part of the second.

42
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:14,194
You and the guy at the back.

43
00:06:14,403 --> 00:06:18,198
You, sir. This lady here.
Just come up. Thank you.

44
00:06:19,032 --> 00:06:20,783
Noel Dichter?

45
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:21,993
Yes.

46
00:06:22,995 --> 00:06:24,371
I have to scan you.

47
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,663
Weapons check?

48
00:06:26,748 --> 00:06:31,043
More for recording devices. Lot of
money invested in these games, Noel.

49
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:35,048
Assistants will help you to port
your pod into your bio-ports...

50
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:37,175
...using Antenna Research's new....

51
00:06:37,884 --> 00:06:39,094
What's in this case?

52
00:06:39,303 --> 00:06:40,845
I brought my game-pod.

53
00:06:41,053 --> 00:06:45,892
Original Marway tissue architecture.
l know it's kind of obsolete.

54
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,646
I couldn't afford the Antenna 1 5
upgrade. l figured out this method--

55
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,481
You won't need it tonight.

56
00:06:52,815 --> 00:06:54,192
Everything's provided for.

57
00:07:04,577 --> 00:07:05,704
How are you doing?

58
00:07:05,953 --> 00:07:07,371
You think two hours, tops?

59
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:09,332
Well, two, three hours.

60
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,918
So you're saying three hours?

61
00:07:12,627 --> 00:07:13,461
Okay.

62
00:07:15,505 --> 00:07:18,049
Everything's in order.
Are you ready, Allegra?

63
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:20,218
Sure. This is my favourite part.

64
00:07:20,426 --> 00:07:21,928
Take it away.

65
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:31,103
All right.

66
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,608
I'm ready to download eXistenZ,
by Antenna Research, into all of you.

67
00:07:36,817 --> 00:07:41,696
Now, l'm warning you,
it's going to be a wild ride.

68
00:07:41,905 --> 00:07:43,825
But don't panic.

69
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:46,326
No matter what happens, okay?

70
00:07:47,744 --> 00:07:50,706
I'll see you back here
in no time at all.

71
00:08:23,655 --> 00:08:26,323
She seems to be very shy.

72
00:08:26,532 --> 00:08:30,787
Never occurred to me
that a big star would be shy.

73
00:08:30,996 --> 00:08:34,875
She spends most of her time alone
in a room, designing her games.

74
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,919
She'd like it best
if she never had to show them.

75
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:17,750
Death to the demoness
Allegra Geller!

76
00:09:23,923 --> 00:09:26,591
Death to Antenna Research!

77
00:09:46,611 --> 00:09:48,572
Get her out of here.
Save her!

78
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:50,866
There might be more of them.
Go on!

79
00:09:51,075 --> 00:09:53,911
-Me? Take her?
-We have enemies in our own house.

80
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,288
Trust no one. Trust no one!

81
00:10:12,804 --> 00:10:15,850
Miss Geller, you're coming with me.

82
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:22,439
I'm responsible for you.
You're supposed to come with me.

83
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,477
Well, what are we
gonna do out here?

84
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:05,273
Do you know your way around?
Do you know any country people?

85
00:11:05,774 --> 00:11:09,234
Not country people.
Games people.

86
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:14,907
Countryside's full of games-development
people, project coordinators...

87
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:16,409
...little factories.

88
00:11:17,117 --> 00:11:19,745
So you know your way.
We can hide out.

89
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,206
Maybe.

90
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:25,501
It seems like l have some enemies
l didn't know l had.

91
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,753
" Death to Allegra Geller."

92
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:30,339
How would you like to hear
someone scream...

93
00:11:30,547 --> 00:11:32,800
..." Death to Ted Pikul"?

94
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,471
How'd you know my name?

95
00:11:38,222 --> 00:11:39,681
You're labelled.

96
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:54,947
What's that?

97
00:11:57,698 --> 00:11:58,784
My pink-fone.

98
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:03,830
Ted Pikul.

99
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:06,208
What hap--

100
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:07,251
What?

101
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:11,880
What did you do that for?

102
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,135
-That was our lifeline to civilization.
-That was a range-finder.

103
00:12:16,343 --> 00:12:18,970
As long as you have that,
they know where we are.

104
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,348
-You mean head office?
-Anybody.

105
00:12:27,478 --> 00:12:30,356
Pikul, why don't you have a gun?

106
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:32,192
What?

107
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:33,526
You're not armed.

108
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:36,947
They told me you're my security,
but you have no weaponry.

109
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:39,323
Who told you that?

110
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:41,117
I'm a marketing trainee.

111
00:12:45,163 --> 00:12:46,622
Fucking hell.

112
00:12:47,957 --> 00:12:52,627
I'm marked for death, and they send me
on the road with a PR nerd.

113
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:55,798
" Marked for death."

114
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:59,093
" Marked for death." Oh, Jesus.

115
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:03,138
Don't sweat it, Pikul.

116
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:05,433
Don't sweat it.
l'm gonna handle it.

117
00:13:05,641 --> 00:13:08,852
And right now we need to stop.

118
00:13:09,937 --> 00:13:11,064
We do? Why?

119
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:15,568
So we can have an intimate
moment together.

120
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,335
If you're gonna do it, do it.

121
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:58,026
Did somebody bite you?

122
00:13:58,777 --> 00:13:59,611
What?

123
00:14:03,657 --> 00:14:05,659
What l just dug out of you.

124
00:14:07,494 --> 00:14:08,327
It's a tooth.

125
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:12,541
A human...

126
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,668
...tooth.

127
00:14:19,714 --> 00:14:21,925
Iet me see that weirdo pistol.

128
00:14:37,232 --> 00:14:40,484
The bullets are human teeth.

129
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:43,404
This one's got a cavity.

130
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,494
That thing was designed to get past any
kind of metal or synthetics detector.

131
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:51,997
It's all flesh and bone.

132
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:56,584
I suppose the smaller calibre pistols
would have to fire baby teeth.

133
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:59,962
The tooth fairy could go
into the arms business.

134
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:01,523
Where were you just now?

135
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:05,735
I was wandering through eXistenZ.

136
00:16:05,944 --> 00:16:08,072
The new system, l mean.

137
00:16:09,823 --> 00:16:11,825
I like it in there.

138
00:16:13,243 --> 00:16:16,621
Of course, without another player
you're only a tourist.

139
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:19,749
It's frustrating.

140
00:16:21,084 --> 00:16:23,211
Why won't you let me contact Antenna?

141
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:30,176
They've gotta be going crazy
wondering what's happened to you.

142
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:35,140
I mean, it's not like
we've done something wrong.

143
00:16:35,682 --> 00:16:39,518
We just ran because we didn't know
how many of them there were, right?

144
00:16:44,523 --> 00:16:47,902
We owe it to Antenna
to let them know you're all right...

145
00:16:50,028 --> 00:16:52,866
...and to get them to send
somebody to help you...

146
00:16:53,074 --> 00:16:54,575
...who knows what he's doing.

147
00:16:55,284 --> 00:16:58,121
Besides, l can't....

148
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:02,040
I can't just keep doing this,
whatever it is...

149
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,585
...you know, forever.

150
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,881
Not having any idea when it's going--

151
00:17:10,841 --> 00:17:12,092
What are you doing?

152
00:17:12,593 --> 00:17:14,011
Where's your bio-port?

153
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:18,098
Don't tell me you've
never been fitted.

154
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,267
I can't believe it.

155
00:17:20,476 --> 00:17:22,644
I was never fitted.
What do you care?

156
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:26,273
You wanna get into the biz,
and you've never played my games?

157
00:17:31,236 --> 00:17:33,739
You've never played any game?

158
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:37,201
Iook.

159
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:42,122
I've been dying to play your games...

160
00:17:43,624 --> 00:17:47,753
...but l have this phobia
about having my body penetrated...

161
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:49,504
...surgically.

162
00:17:50,546 --> 00:17:52,341
You know what l mean.

163
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:55,676
No, l'm not sure that l do.

164
00:17:55,927 --> 00:17:58,597
Getting a bio-port fitted.

165
00:18:00,223 --> 00:18:02,726
I don't know. l can't do it.

166
00:18:03,477 --> 00:18:05,937
It's too freaky.
Makes my skin crawl.

167
00:18:06,187 --> 00:18:09,399
They just pop your spine
with a little hydro-gun.

168
00:18:09,607 --> 00:18:11,359
They shoot the port plug into it.

169
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,237
It's like getting your ears pierced.

170
00:18:14,445 --> 00:18:18,117
With only an infinitesimal
chance of permanent spinal paralysis.

171
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:21,869
-l've read all about it.
-lt's your chosen profession.

172
00:18:24,414 --> 00:18:26,416
Besides, once you're ported...

173
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:29,794
...there's no end to the games
you can play.

174
00:18:30,503 --> 00:18:33,506
You can't seriously wanna
play games now.

175
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:37,385
Not here. Not while we're being
hunted down by crazy people.

176
00:18:45,393 --> 00:18:49,438
My baby here took a huge hit
in the church, Pikul.

177
00:18:49,646 --> 00:18:52,567
One of those UmbyCords
got ripped out of her.

178
00:18:52,775 --> 00:18:54,484
Ripped out of her.

179
00:18:54,943 --> 00:18:59,906
Just as the game architecture was being
downloaded from her to the slave pods.

180
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:04,078
That's a very vulnerable time for her.

181
00:19:05,996 --> 00:19:09,875
She could be crying out
for help right here...

182
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,626
...right now.

183
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:16,047
The only way l can tell...

184
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,676
...if the game's
not been contaminated...

185
00:19:19,343 --> 00:19:24,307
...the pod is not about to be crippled
for life because of my negligence...

186
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,728
...is to play eXistenZ...

187
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,856
...with somebody friendly.

188
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,444
Are you friendly?

189
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:40,363
Or are you not?

190
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:45,786
Sure.

191
00:19:49,414 --> 00:19:50,791
Iet's do it.

192
00:19:52,334 --> 00:19:53,543
Iet's do it now.

193
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:56,671
Iet me see.

194
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,299
To get an illegal...

195
00:19:59,508 --> 00:20:02,302
...unregistered bio-port installed...

196
00:20:02,511 --> 00:20:05,388
...at about midnight...

197
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:09,476
...we just drive up to your local
country gas station, right?

198
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,741
Anything else l can do for you?

199
00:20:24,949 --> 00:20:26,117
Well, Gas...

200
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:29,496
...you could check
your bio-port plugs.

201
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,081
The what? Spark plugs?

202
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,792
You heard me.

203
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:37,294
My friend here
has a bio-port problem.

204
00:20:37,795 --> 00:20:39,631
A bio-port. Now...

205
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,385
...that's a sort of hole
in your spine, isn't it?

206
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,973
Iots of assholes around here,
but that's generally it.

207
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:55,688
I don't know why you'd be
talking to me about that, lady.

208
00:20:57,606 --> 00:20:59,400
Sure you do.

209
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:23,382
Allegra Geller.

210
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:26,092
You've changed my life.

211
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,056
What was your life like before?

212
00:21:31,806 --> 00:21:33,016
Before?

213
00:21:34,518 --> 00:21:36,644
Before it was changed
by Allegra Geller.

214
00:21:37,645 --> 00:21:39,648
I operated a gas station.

215
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,359
You still operate a gas station.

216
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,822
Only on the most pathetic
level of reality.

217
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:51,117
Geller's work liberated me.

218
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:52,619
Iiberated?

219
00:21:53,203 --> 00:21:55,122
Did you ever play her game ArtGod?

220
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,540
One word. Capital "A."
Capital "G."

221
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,209
I don't have a bio-port.

222
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,631
"Thou, the player of the game, art God."
Very spiritual.

223
00:22:06,174 --> 00:22:07,801
Funny too.

224
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:12,555
God, the artist, the mechanic.

225
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:13,640
Funny.

226
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:19,938
Here we go.

227
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,823
Those are sterilized...

228
00:22:30,031 --> 00:22:31,115
...aren't they?

229
00:22:31,323 --> 00:22:32,408
Not to worry.

230
00:22:32,616 --> 00:22:36,203
You could fire in a bio-port
in a slaughterhouse...

231
00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:39,124
...and never generate an infection.

232
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:41,458
Then why the clean overalls?

233
00:22:45,004 --> 00:22:46,213
It's a mental thing.

234
00:22:46,463 --> 00:22:48,340
Helps me focus.

235
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:53,303
The one thing you don't wanna do
is miss with the stud-finder.

236
00:22:55,597 --> 00:22:56,432
Oh, God.

237
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,474
God?

238
00:22:58,434 --> 00:22:59,727
The mechanic.

239
00:23:02,104 --> 00:23:04,148
Step into my office.

240
00:24:36,154 --> 00:24:38,616
See? That didn't hurt, did it?

241
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:40,743
I didn't expect that to hurt.

242
00:24:42,202 --> 00:24:43,913
I expect the next part to hurt.

243
00:24:50,628 --> 00:24:52,295
That's what l expect to hurt.

244
00:24:52,754 --> 00:24:54,841
I haven't crippled anyone yet.

245
00:24:56,175 --> 00:24:57,467
How many have you done?

246
00:24:57,676 --> 00:24:58,635
Three.

247
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:02,806
Well, you'll be my third.

248
00:25:28,457 --> 00:25:29,499
Easy.

249
00:25:31,084 --> 00:25:33,170
-What was going on, Gas?
-Hell...

250
00:25:33,378 --> 00:25:36,381
...he's acting
like l'm attacking him.

251
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:38,842
People usually pay me to do this.

252
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:40,927
Yeah? All two of them!

253
00:25:42,178 --> 00:25:43,513
As you can see...

254
00:25:43,722 --> 00:25:46,266
...l've decided not to have
a bio-port installed.

255
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:01,531
This is it, you see.

256
00:26:01,739 --> 00:26:04,116
This is the cage of your own making...

257
00:26:04,325 --> 00:26:09,288
...which keeps you trapped and pacing
about in the smallest space forever.

258
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,042
Break out of your cage, Pikul.

259
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,171
Break out now.

260
00:26:28,766 --> 00:26:30,893
The swelling doesn't last for long.

261
00:26:31,143 --> 00:26:33,270
Tomorrow you won't even notice it.

262
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:36,815
I love it.

263
00:26:37,733 --> 00:26:39,110
Great.

264
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:46,825
What's going on?
l can't move my legs!

265
00:26:47,033 --> 00:26:48,327
The procedure comes...

266
00:26:48,536 --> 00:26:50,079
...with its own epidural.

267
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:52,872
Just like when you have a baby.

268
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:56,252
Kind of instant paralysis
from the waist down.

269
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,586
That's why it didn't hurt you.

270
00:26:58,796 --> 00:27:00,506
It'll wear off in no time.

271
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,552
I'm gonna go wash up.

272
00:27:04,844 --> 00:27:08,221
You two make yourselves at home.

273
00:27:20,443 --> 00:27:23,528
We don't have to wait
for the swelling to go down.

274
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,413
You're gonna port into me
while l'm paralysed?

275
00:27:35,457 --> 00:27:37,709
You wanted to play my game,
didn't you?

276
00:27:38,585 --> 00:27:40,962
Yeah, l did. l do, but--

277
00:27:41,546 --> 00:27:43,131
Here? Now?

278
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:45,633
It's an instant-on world, isn't it?

279
00:27:47,384 --> 00:27:48,970
What's that for?

280
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:51,014
Feels...

281
00:27:51,222 --> 00:27:52,057
...cold.

282
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:56,311
New ports are sometimes
a bit tight.

283
00:27:57,561 --> 00:27:59,189
Wouldn't wanna hurt you.

284
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,358
How come...

285
00:28:04,277 --> 00:28:07,362
...bio-ports don't get infected?

286
00:28:07,613 --> 00:28:08,989
I mean...

287
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:13,786
...they open right
into your body.

288
00:28:16,498 --> 00:28:20,877
Iisten to what you're saying, Pikul.
Don't be ludicrous.

289
00:28:32,846 --> 00:28:35,641
Don't you think
you could call me Ted?

290
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:38,602
Maybe afterwards.

291
00:29:09,758 --> 00:29:11,343
Shit!

292
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,593
Pikul!

293
00:29:13,469 --> 00:29:14,847
I can't believe it.

294
00:29:15,055 --> 00:29:15,931
You blew my pod!

295
00:29:17,349 --> 00:29:18,641
You neural-surged.

296
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:19,727
What do you mean?

297
00:29:19,935 --> 00:29:22,396
I jacked you into my pod
and you panicked.

298
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:24,522
It's totally fucked!

299
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,984
This is a disaster.

300
00:29:27,984 --> 00:29:30,529
I was nervous,
but l didn't panic.

301
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:36,410
I was forced to trust you, and you
panicked and you neural-surged...

302
00:29:36,618 --> 00:29:37,994
...and you blew my pod.

303
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:40,788
You can get a new pod.

304
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:42,999
Pikul.

305
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:46,627
In this pod...

306
00:29:46,879 --> 00:29:51,215
...is the only, the original
version of eXistenZ.

307
00:29:51,424 --> 00:29:55,178
An entire game system that cost
38 million to develop.

308
00:29:55,386 --> 00:29:57,847
Not including prerelease
marketing costs.

309
00:29:58,056 --> 00:30:01,142
And l'm locked outside my own game.

310
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,978
I can't get me in or it out.

311
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:09,400
Are you serious?
That's the only version that exists?

312
00:30:10,026 --> 00:30:12,612
It's the only one
and it's stuck inside...

313
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,364
...and it's your fault.

314
00:30:19,827 --> 00:30:24,749
I've devoted five of my most passionate
years to this strange little creature.

315
00:30:27,668 --> 00:30:29,961
And l've never regretted it, Pikul.

316
00:30:31,506 --> 00:30:35,425
I knew it was the only thing
that could give my life any meaning.

317
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:40,722
Why is it my fault?

318
00:30:41,724 --> 00:30:43,558
I'm telling you, l didn't.

319
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,268
I did not neural-surge.

320
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:46,479
I didn't.

321
00:30:46,687 --> 00:30:48,688
I didn't feel any surging.

322
00:30:49,523 --> 00:30:50,690
It's not your fault.

323
00:30:52,944 --> 00:30:54,569
It's my fault.

324
00:30:56,738 --> 00:30:58,490
Oh, no, Gas. Not you.

325
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:02,119
I wouldn't try to use
that bio-port again.

326
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:05,414
Except maybe for a toaster
or something.

327
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:09,084
What's going on?

328
00:31:10,377 --> 00:31:14,297
You're worth a lot of money
if you're dead.

329
00:31:14,881 --> 00:31:15,924
What are you talking about?

330
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:20,262
You know what l'm talking about.
lt's all over the countryside.

331
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:24,641
Five million dollars for her dead body.
No questions asked.

332
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,397
But she changed your life.

333
00:31:30,605 --> 00:31:31,773
Yeah.

334
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:34,024
Now l'm gonna change hers.

335
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,071
Why did you install
a bad port into me?

336
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,658
There's a bonus for killing...

337
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:46,621
...Allegra Geller's latest game,
or whatever it is.

338
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,331
I think l just did that, didn't l?

339
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:56,297
But can you kill me, Gas?
Can you kill a person?

340
00:31:57,632 --> 00:31:59,008
Can you do that?

341
00:32:00,342 --> 00:32:01,385
Hide my body...

342
00:32:02,763 --> 00:32:04,847
...contact the crazies...

343
00:32:05,473 --> 00:32:07,558
...trust them to pay up?

344
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:11,020
Hand over my now decaying,
fucking grotesque corpse...

345
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:15,066
...really expect them to hand over
five mill cash?

346
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:19,653
I mean, don't you ever go
to the fucking movies?

347
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:23,615
I like your script.

348
00:32:26,952 --> 00:32:28,661
I wanna be in it.

349
00:32:54,521 --> 00:32:57,191
Oh, God, l think he's dead.

350
00:33:00,902 --> 00:33:02,822
He wanted to kill you.

351
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:11,413
That's two people in one day...

352
00:33:11,663 --> 00:33:14,082
...who wanted to actually kill you.

353
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:17,836
I've never been more popular.

354
00:33:18,754 --> 00:33:20,380
Allegra, we need help.

355
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:26,177
You're right. l've gotta
get this pod fixed.

356
00:33:48,991 --> 00:33:50,451
We're going skiing?

357
00:34:08,803 --> 00:34:10,637
Iook at that huge bug.

358
00:34:11,472 --> 00:34:13,516
It's got two heads.

359
00:34:13,725 --> 00:34:17,854
It's not a bug. lt's a mutated
amphibian. lt's a frog...

360
00:34:18,063 --> 00:34:20,773
...salamander-lizard thing.

361
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,108
Sign of the times.

362
00:34:31,825 --> 00:34:35,621
What happens if somebody comes up here
and really wants to ski?

363
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:40,042
Nobody actually physically
skis anymore. You know that.

364
00:34:52,346 --> 00:34:54,181
No, don't use that!

365
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:56,892
And bring me the sterile wash.

366
00:35:01,145 --> 00:35:03,273
My darling.

367
00:35:10,113 --> 00:35:12,324
Allegra Geller.

368
00:35:14,076 --> 00:35:16,119
I am so pleased...

369
00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:20,081
...and so astonished to see you here.

370
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:21,666
Kiri Vinokur...

371
00:35:21,874 --> 00:35:23,752
...my bodyguard, Ted Pikul.

372
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,755
Sterile wash.

373
00:35:30,216 --> 00:35:32,135
I hear this ridiculous story...

374
00:35:32,385 --> 00:35:35,138
...about some fatwa against you.

375
00:35:35,555 --> 00:35:38,683
The company are desperately
trying to find you.

376
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:41,436
Is this really serious?
Are you in danger?

377
00:35:42,437 --> 00:35:45,064
There have been a couple
of attempts on my life.

378
00:35:45,314 --> 00:35:47,859
This is unbearable.
The company must stop this.

379
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:50,486
They owe you every kind
of protection.

380
00:35:50,737 --> 00:35:55,073
I don't know if they can do anything.
lt seems to be open season on me.

381
00:35:56,409 --> 00:35:58,077
You're safe here.
l assure you.

382
00:35:59,203 --> 00:36:03,249
I will contact Antenna right away
and have them send some people over--

383
00:36:03,499 --> 00:36:05,709
No, Kiri, don't.

384
00:36:06,168 --> 00:36:07,628
Tell no one we're here.

385
00:36:07,837 --> 00:36:11,298
I can't be sure that Antenna
is completely safe for me.

386
00:36:11,506 --> 00:36:12,717
I understand. Yes.

387
00:36:13,843 --> 00:36:15,093
You know...

388
00:36:16,344 --> 00:36:19,931
...you can hide out in one
of the guest chalets...

389
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,059
...as long as you like.

390
00:36:23,478 --> 00:36:26,104
And l'll make sure
you get fresh towels.

391
00:36:27,481 --> 00:36:30,609
And make sure l don't lose everything
l have in here.

392
00:36:32,486 --> 00:36:33,821
You bet.

393
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:48,043
Take that.

394
00:36:49,503 --> 00:36:50,337
Good.

395
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:56,385
Pull this back.

396
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,054
What did you port into?

397
00:37:02,057 --> 00:37:03,183
Pikul's bio-port.

398
00:37:03,558 --> 00:37:06,061
That's what caused
all the damage?

399
00:37:07,729 --> 00:37:10,398
It was a flawed installation.
My first.

400
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:12,526
Well...

401
00:37:14,695 --> 00:37:16,570
...it fried a lot of expensive...

402
00:37:16,779 --> 00:37:18,532
...neural webbing.

403
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,825
You see?

404
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:22,452
Iooks like an animal in there.

405
00:37:23,495 --> 00:37:26,539
Feels like you're operating
on somebody's pet dog.

406
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,918
I told you, Landry,
we have become...

407
00:37:30,126 --> 00:37:32,294
...glorified veterinarians.

408
00:37:33,296 --> 00:37:35,172
Put a little in there, please.

409
00:37:39,845 --> 00:37:43,514
The eXistenZ game-pod is basically
an animal, Mr. Pikul.

410
00:37:44,516 --> 00:37:49,646
It's grown from fertilized amphibian
eggs stuffed with synthetic DNA.

411
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:52,273
Only Antenna has this.

412
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:56,360
Wow. Where do the batteries go?

413
00:37:58,404 --> 00:37:59,530
Very funny.

414
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:02,658
He's not kidding.

415
00:38:02,867 --> 00:38:07,663
He's a total PR nerd. lt ports
into you. You're the power source.

416
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:12,293
Your body, your nervous system,
your metabolism, your energy.

417
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:15,545
You get tired, rundown,
it won't run properly.

418
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:23,596
Iandry here will finish up
the pod work. Now, let's...

419
00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:27,308
...get that nasty bio-port out,
put a nice fresh one in.

420
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:36,357
It hurts.

421
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,486
I think it's infected.

422
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:40,862
No, it's not infected.

423
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:44,408
It's just excited.

424
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,244
It wants action.

425
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:51,206
I really don't think
l want action. Me, l mean.

426
00:38:51,581 --> 00:38:54,209
The bearer of the excited bio-port.

427
00:38:58,171 --> 00:39:02,717
My baby has now taken three major hits.
One in the church...

428
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:06,679
...one in the gas station
and one on the operating table.

429
00:39:06,888 --> 00:39:09,766
The only way l can tell
if everything's okay...

430
00:39:10,683 --> 00:39:14,854
...is to play eXistenZ
with somebody friendly.

431
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:19,859
Are you friendly or are you not?

432
00:39:24,197 --> 00:39:27,409
You're telling me this thing
will run off my body's energy?

433
00:39:27,617 --> 00:39:29,452
That's how they work.

434
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:35,291
See? You're humming along already.

435
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:40,213
eXistenZ.

436
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,467
Only from Antenna.

437
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:46,135
Here we go.

438
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:49,889
You've got a bit
of an unfair advantage.

439
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:55,103
How can l possibly compete
with the designer of the system?

440
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:59,314
Well, you could...

441
00:39:59,524 --> 00:40:02,401
...beat the guy that
invented poker, couldn't you?

442
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:28,260
-You want that one?
-Yeah, that one.

443
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:31,095
-Are you sure you want that one?
-Yes.

444
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:33,515
-l wouldn't recommend it.
-Why not?

445
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:37,435
The graphics on this one are better.
There's no comparison.

446
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:40,814
-This is the one you want.
-That one?

447
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:42,857
That was beautiful.

448
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,493
I feel just like me.

449
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:56,371
Is that kind of transition normal?

450
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:02,460
That kind of smooth interlacing
from place to place?

451
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,630
Depends on the style of the game.

452
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:08,257
You can get jagged brutal cuts,
slow fades...

453
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,636
...shimmering little morphs.

454
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,391
This is amazing.

455
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,812
I had no idea.

456
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,068
Iook at this.
Games l've never heard of.

457
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:28,736
Wait a minute.

458
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,905
That reminds me.

459
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:36,035
What precisely is the goal of the game
that we're playing now?

460
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:41,915
You have to play the game to find out
why you're playing the game.

461
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,502
It's the future, Pikul.

462
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,131
You'll see how natural it feels.

463
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,239
Iook at this.

464
00:42:20,203 --> 00:42:23,582
Can this be the future too?
Ever see anything like this before?

465
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,584
These are delicate.

466
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:27,044
You got to be...

467
00:42:27,252 --> 00:42:28,462
...careful.

468
00:42:29,921 --> 00:42:31,340
Yes, l can imagine.

469
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,008
Cortical Systematics...

470
00:42:33,216 --> 00:42:36,762
...is the latest and the hottest.
Not just a new game...

471
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,680
...but a new system.

472
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:42,768
Will it work with an industry
standard bio-port?

473
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:44,978
I'm D'Arcy Nader.

474
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:50,734
Welcome to D'Arcy Nader's
Game Emporium.

475
00:42:50,984 --> 00:42:54,529
Is there anything l can be
helping you with?

476
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,281
We're just looking.

477
00:43:02,453 --> 00:43:04,456
I have...

478
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,708
...what you're looking for.

479
00:43:09,961 --> 00:43:11,338
Who sent you?

480
00:43:14,215 --> 00:43:16,426
It's none of your business
who sent us.

481
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:17,968
We're here.

482
00:43:18,177 --> 00:43:19,678
That's all that matters.

483
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:23,516
God.

484
00:43:24,725 --> 00:43:26,144
What happened?

485
00:43:28,104 --> 00:43:30,106
I didn't mean to say that.

486
00:43:30,898 --> 00:43:32,650
Your character said it.

487
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,778
It's a kind of schizophrenic feeling,
isn't it?

488
00:43:35,986 --> 00:43:37,363
You'll get used to it.

489
00:43:37,571 --> 00:43:40,991
There are things that have to be said
to advance the plot.

490
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,328
Those things get said whether
you wanna say them or not.

491
00:43:44,578 --> 00:43:45,621
Don't fight it.

492
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,623
Just go with it.

493
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:51,252
But should you be saying this
in front of him?

494
00:43:55,005 --> 00:43:56,006
Iook at him.

495
00:44:02,929 --> 00:44:05,641
-What's he doing?
-He's gone into a game loop.

496
00:44:06,892 --> 00:44:11,063
He won't come out of it until you give
him a proper line of game dialogue.

497
00:44:15,234 --> 00:44:16,819
This is tricky.

498
00:44:18,445 --> 00:44:20,573
Start by repeating your last line.

499
00:44:20,781 --> 00:44:23,700
Include his name so he knows
you're talking to him.

500
00:44:29,414 --> 00:44:31,125
We're here, D'Arcy Nader...

501
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:34,586
...and that's all that matters.

502
00:44:34,836 --> 00:44:39,132
Yes, you're right.
That is all that matters.

503
00:44:43,511 --> 00:44:47,058
Now, you said you have
what we want.

504
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,142
We're waiting.

505
00:44:50,143 --> 00:44:53,063
You're going to need
these micro-pods...

506
00:44:53,271 --> 00:44:55,398
...to download your new identities.

507
00:44:56,649 --> 00:44:59,027
I assume that you both
have had these...

508
00:44:59,986 --> 00:45:02,238
...industry standard bio-ports...

509
00:45:02,446 --> 00:45:04,657
...that you mentioned installed.

510
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,410
Yes, of course,
we both have bio-ports.

511
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:12,873
We do, don't we?

512
00:45:13,457 --> 00:45:14,417
I assumed we did.

513
00:45:18,003 --> 00:45:19,798
In the game, we might not.

514
00:45:20,924 --> 00:45:22,175
We better check.

515
00:45:24,093 --> 00:45:25,387
Yeah, it's there.

516
00:45:25,595 --> 00:45:28,013
Iooks a little different,
but it's there.

517
00:45:31,685 --> 00:45:33,560
Yeah, l see what you mean.

518
00:45:34,853 --> 00:45:37,564
Yes, we both have bio-ports.

519
00:45:38,649 --> 00:45:39,483
Good.

520
00:45:40,943 --> 00:45:42,487
Port in.

521
00:45:42,695 --> 00:45:46,950
And this will tell you
all you need to know...

522
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,659
...for now.

523
00:45:49,034 --> 00:45:54,164
I'm going to leave, while you two
finish up here because...

524
00:45:55,624 --> 00:46:00,129
...it wouldn't be good for us all
to be seen together.

525
00:46:09,221 --> 00:46:12,724
I assume that Nader is our
entry point into the game.

526
00:46:12,932 --> 00:46:15,728
Yeah, kind of disappointing.

527
00:46:15,936 --> 00:46:16,770
Nader?

528
00:46:17,021 --> 00:46:21,358
He's not a very well-drawn character.
His dialogue was just so-so.

529
00:46:21,608 --> 00:46:22,443
His accent....

530
00:46:37,374 --> 00:46:39,834
The pods are so small...

531
00:46:40,585 --> 00:46:43,838
...they plug directly
into the bio-port.

532
00:46:55,516 --> 00:46:56,351
Oh, God.

533
00:46:56,559 --> 00:46:57,394
What happened?

534
00:46:58,936 --> 00:47:03,608
The whole pod just disappeared
into your back.

535
00:47:04,525 --> 00:47:06,194
It disappeared into my back?

536
00:47:06,444 --> 00:47:09,030
It's working its way
round my spinal cord?

537
00:47:09,238 --> 00:47:11,366
Don't panic. lt's just a game.

538
00:47:11,574 --> 00:47:13,241
Do you feel anything yet?

539
00:47:16,037 --> 00:47:17,413
No, l don't.

540
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:20,124
Not a thing.
l don't feel a thing.

541
00:47:22,877 --> 00:47:24,504
Do you want me to do you?

542
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:04,751
What the hell was that?

543
00:48:06,461 --> 00:48:09,965
That wasn't me.
lt was my game character.

544
00:48:10,173 --> 00:48:12,884
I wouldn't have done that.
Not here anyway.

545
00:48:31,445 --> 00:48:34,990
Our characters are obviously
supposed to jump on each other.

546
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:37,367
It's most probably...

547
00:48:39,201 --> 00:48:42,122
...a pathetically
mechanical attempt...

548
00:48:42,372 --> 00:48:46,460
...to heighten the emotional tension
of the next game sequence.

549
00:48:56,344 --> 00:48:57,554
No use fighting it.

550
00:48:58,221 --> 00:49:01,767
What about our new identities?

551
00:49:02,267 --> 00:49:04,185
Do you feel yours yet?

552
00:49:04,977 --> 00:49:07,314
They'll take care of themselves.

553
00:49:14,445 --> 00:49:16,697
I'm very worried about my body.

554
00:49:17,365 --> 00:49:18,991
Your what?

555
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,455
Where are our real bodies?

556
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,707
Are they all right?

557
00:49:26,999 --> 00:49:29,418
What if they're hungry?
What if there's danger?

558
00:49:32,088 --> 00:49:34,632
They're just where we left them.

559
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,176
They're sitting quietly...

560
00:49:37,426 --> 00:49:39,010
...eyes closed.

561
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,893
It's just like meditating.

562
00:49:52,525 --> 00:49:54,025
I feel really vulnerable.

563
00:49:55,568 --> 00:49:57,071
Disembodied.

564
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:05,078
Don't sweat it.

565
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:13,838
All your senses
are still operating.

566
00:50:18,509 --> 00:50:21,761
You'll pop right out
of the game if there's a problem.

567
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:02,969
Trying to remember who you are?

568
00:51:05,846 --> 00:51:09,725
Hey, it works!
l must be Yevgeny Nourish.

569
00:51:10,142 --> 00:51:12,187
And you are new to trout farm.

570
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,857
Yes, l'm....

571
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,902
I'm very new.

572
00:51:19,401 --> 00:51:20,694
Did you say "trout farm"?

573
00:51:21,904 --> 00:51:23,698
Yeah, trout farm.

574
00:51:23,907 --> 00:51:28,328
You know, raising baby trout from eggs
and releasing them in rivers.

575
00:51:28,536 --> 00:51:31,163
Entire place used to be trout farm.

576
00:51:31,372 --> 00:51:36,502
From outside, you would never guess
it's now factory for making game-pods.

577
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:41,215
Seems like most everything
used to be something else, yes?

578
00:51:49,264 --> 00:51:52,059
You're new, but you seem
to know what you're doing.

579
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:55,396
It surprises me more
than it surprises you.

580
00:51:59,524 --> 00:52:02,528
You're new, but you seem
to know what you're doing.

581
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:34,059
I've been trained by the very best.

582
00:52:38,772 --> 00:52:42,525
So have l, my friend.
So have l.

583
00:52:43,317 --> 00:52:46,070
Where are you planning
to have lunch?

584
00:52:49,616 --> 00:52:51,075
I'm new here.

585
00:52:52,785 --> 00:52:54,828
I have no plans for lunch.

586
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:59,751
May l suggest the Chinese restaurant
in the forest?

587
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:03,379
Everyone knows where it is.
Just ask.

588
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:07,967
Well, won't you be going there too?

589
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,346
Unfortunately, l have
other plans for lunch.

590
00:53:11,596 --> 00:53:13,931
But l do suggest
you order the special.

591
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,934
And don't take no for answer.

592
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:20,896
All right, l'll do that.

593
00:53:30,155 --> 00:53:31,073
Iarry.

594
00:53:33,534 --> 00:53:34,369
Yes?

595
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,996
They need this in the back.
They asked for you.

596
00:54:58,868 --> 00:55:03,122
I saw you make contact, Larry. What
did the guy on the assembly line say?

597
00:55:03,372 --> 00:55:06,125
Can you believe the game version
of your pod?

598
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:07,168
It's sick...

599
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,464
...and so unconvincing! l mean,
using mutated animal organs...

600
00:55:11,672 --> 00:55:15,800
...and nervous systems as game-pod parts
is certainly feasible...

601
00:55:16,886 --> 00:55:18,471
...but everything's so dirty.

602
00:55:19,347 --> 00:55:20,473
Absurd.

603
00:55:21,515 --> 00:55:22,641
Grotesque.

604
00:55:34,028 --> 00:55:38,949
I saw you make contact, Larry. What
did the guy on the assembly line say?

605
00:55:42,994 --> 00:55:46,247
He told me where to have lunch.

606
00:56:28,123 --> 00:56:31,375
We have nice sea bass today.

607
00:56:31,667 --> 00:56:34,087
Shall l bring it for everyone?

608
00:56:35,296 --> 00:56:36,797
We want the special.

609
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:51,020
Did you hear me, Chinese waiter?

610
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:53,773
We want the special.

611
00:56:54,941 --> 00:57:00,071
The special is for special occasions.
l cannot give you the special.

612
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:09,121
But this is a special occasion.

613
00:57:10,665 --> 00:57:12,458
It's her birthday.

614
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:19,048
A birthday is a special occasion.

615
00:57:19,256 --> 00:57:22,676
I will therefore bring the special
for everybody.

616
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:35,022
I guess the special
isn't very popular.

617
00:57:35,272 --> 00:57:36,606
I guess not.

618
00:57:46,282 --> 00:57:48,327
I wanna put the game on pause.

619
00:57:50,829 --> 00:57:52,872
The game can be paused, can't it?

620
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:56,251
I mean, all games
can be paused, right?

621
00:57:56,834 --> 00:57:59,546
Yeah, sure. But why? What's wrong?

622
00:57:59,755 --> 00:58:03,341
Aren't you dying to see
what's so special about the special?

623
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:08,429
I'm feeling a little disconnected
from my real life.

624
00:58:09,013 --> 00:58:11,557
I'm losing touch
with the texture of it.

625
00:58:11,766 --> 00:58:13,851
You know what l mean?
l actually think...

626
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:17,271
...there's an element
of psychosis involved here.

627
00:58:19,565 --> 00:58:20,901
This is a great sign.

628
00:58:21,151 --> 00:58:24,821
Your nervous system is fully
engaging with the game architecture.

629
00:58:29,492 --> 00:58:32,412
eXistenZ is paused!

630
00:58:46,675 --> 00:58:48,386
Did l do that?

631
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:52,764
I guess l did.

632
00:58:54,308 --> 00:58:55,852
So how does it feel?

633
00:58:56,893 --> 00:58:57,728
What?

634
00:59:01,982 --> 00:59:03,650
Your real life.

635
00:59:04,485 --> 00:59:06,737
The one you came back for.

636
00:59:06,945 --> 00:59:09,240
It feels completely unreal.

637
00:59:09,907 --> 00:59:12,784
You're stuck now, aren't you?

638
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,497
You wanna go back
to the Chinese restaurant...

639
00:59:16,705 --> 00:59:19,249
...because there's
nothing happening here.

640
00:59:19,875 --> 00:59:22,586
We're safe. lt's boring.

641
00:59:26,132 --> 00:59:28,008
It's worse than that.

642
00:59:39,144 --> 00:59:40,187
I'm not sure....

643
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,941
I'm not sure here...

644
00:59:45,192 --> 00:59:46,360
...where we are...

645
00:59:47,361 --> 00:59:49,279
...is real at all.

646
00:59:52,866 --> 00:59:54,910
This feels like a game to me.

647
00:59:57,161 --> 00:59:58,538
And you...

648
00:59:58,747 --> 01:00:01,500
...you're beginning to feel
like a game character.

649
01:00:08,882 --> 01:00:10,217
Definitely not.

650
01:00:29,402 --> 01:00:31,196
Iet's go back.

651
01:01:01,684 --> 01:01:04,353
Special order for the birthday girl.

652
01:01:12,944 --> 01:01:15,197
Hope you enjoy it very much.

653
01:01:21,412 --> 01:01:23,621
Iook, it's our two-headed friend.

654
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:25,583
Doesn't look too healthy.

655
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:29,210
I think l lost my appetite.

656
01:01:29,794 --> 01:01:31,505
Oh, a shame.

657
01:01:32,505 --> 01:01:34,632
Mutant reptiles and amphibians...

658
01:01:34,841 --> 01:01:39,971
...provide new and previously
unimagined taste sensations.

659
01:01:40,722 --> 01:01:43,558
Shall l clear all this away?

660
01:01:48,563 --> 01:01:51,483
We're happy.

661
01:01:53,234 --> 01:01:55,236
Very good.

662
01:01:55,653 --> 01:01:56,738
Enjoy.

663
01:02:26,184 --> 01:02:29,144
Pikul, what are you doing?

664
01:02:29,478 --> 01:02:31,189
I don't know.

665
01:02:33,315 --> 01:02:36,528
I find this disgusting,
but l can't help myself.

666
01:02:39,405 --> 01:02:40,239
Good.

667
01:02:40,865 --> 01:02:43,492
"Good"? You think this is good?

668
01:02:44,326 --> 01:02:45,244
Yeah.

669
01:02:45,452 --> 01:02:47,247
It's a genuine game urge.

670
01:02:47,455 --> 01:02:49,748
It's something your character
was born to do.

671
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:52,544
Don't fight it.

672
01:02:52,752 --> 01:02:54,461
I'm fighting it.

673
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:58,632
But it isn't doing me any good.

674
01:03:42,926 --> 01:03:44,719
Oh, my God.

675
01:03:47,473 --> 01:03:49,515
This looks awfully familiar.

676
01:03:55,438 --> 01:03:56,815
You sure this is okay?

677
01:03:58,108 --> 01:04:02,029
Yeah, it should be okay.

678
01:04:28,387 --> 01:04:30,848
Do you have that bridge
in real life?

679
01:04:31,099 --> 01:04:35,186
Absolutely not.
My teeth are perfect.

680
01:05:05,382 --> 01:05:10,178
Death to the demoness
Allegra Geller.

681
01:05:16,727 --> 01:05:18,562
That's not funny.

682
01:05:22,315 --> 01:05:23,317
Sorry.

683
01:05:26,903 --> 01:05:28,363
But, you know...

684
01:05:30,741 --> 01:05:33,368
...l do feel the urge
to kill someone here.

685
01:05:34,286 --> 01:05:35,162
Who?

686
01:05:43,587 --> 01:05:45,005
I need to kill our waiter.

687
01:05:50,761 --> 01:05:52,763
Well, that makes sense.

688
01:05:56,391 --> 01:05:57,351
Waiter!

689
01:05:58,727 --> 01:05:59,727
Waiter!

690
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:07,778
When he comes over, do it.
Don't hesitate.

691
01:06:09,445 --> 01:06:11,739
But everything in the game...

692
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:15,785
...is so realistic.
l don't think l really could.

693
01:06:16,202 --> 01:06:18,747
You won't be able to stop yourself.
Enjoy it.

694
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:23,001
Free will is obviously
not a big factor...

695
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:25,044
...in this little world of ours.

696
01:06:25,878 --> 01:06:29,882
It's like real life. There's
just enough to make it interesting.

697
01:06:35,888 --> 01:06:37,848
He's too nice.

698
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:39,517
I won't do it.

699
01:06:41,644 --> 01:06:44,689
What can l do to make
your lunch more pleasant?

700
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:48,693
I found this in my soup...

701
01:06:48,943 --> 01:06:51,362
...and l'm very upset.

702
01:07:41,411 --> 01:07:42,662
It's all right.

703
01:07:43,997 --> 01:07:48,293
Just a little misunderstanding...

704
01:07:48,793 --> 01:07:50,587
...over the check.

705
01:07:57,469 --> 01:08:00,179
Pay no attention
and enjoy your meal.

706
01:08:12,567 --> 01:08:15,319
I feel a serious game urge...

707
01:08:15,527 --> 01:08:17,072
...to get out of here.

708
01:08:24,162 --> 01:08:26,455
Through the kitchen. That way.

709
01:08:36,757 --> 01:08:39,593
Did you like the meal
l prepared for you?

710
01:08:41,845 --> 01:08:43,347
It was very...

711
01:08:44,765 --> 01:08:45,599
...revealing.

712
01:08:45,933 --> 01:08:47,559
It certainly was for me.

713
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:51,480
You both passed our little test
with flying colours.

714
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:55,442
-Why did the Chinese waiter have to die?
-A waiter hears...

715
01:08:55,693 --> 01:08:59,488
...many things spoken when
people are relaxing and eating.

716
01:08:59,696 --> 01:09:02,825
A waiter has many opportunities
for betrayal.

717
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:07,997
He betrayed you?

718
01:09:08,205 --> 01:09:11,125
He betrayed us. Us!

719
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:13,252
Come. This way.

720
01:09:15,878 --> 01:09:16,714
Come.

721
01:09:23,345 --> 01:09:26,305
These are the breeding pools.

722
01:09:27,098 --> 01:09:28,017
Breeding pools.

723
01:09:28,267 --> 01:09:29,643
Is this....

724
01:09:29,851 --> 01:09:32,562
Is this where you caught
today's special?

725
01:09:34,023 --> 01:09:37,108
We originally were raising
these mutant creatures...

726
01:09:37,316 --> 01:09:40,486
...for their nervous systems
for game-pods.

727
01:09:40,695 --> 01:09:45,408
But then we found they
could be quite tasty.

728
01:09:45,616 --> 01:09:48,996
So we opened the restaurant,
and now that is our cover.

729
01:09:49,538 --> 01:09:52,415
We are also raising them
as components...

730
01:09:52,623 --> 01:09:55,585
...for undetectable and
hypoallergenic weapons.

731
01:09:56,336 --> 01:09:58,921
Right under the noses
of our enemies.

732
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:02,508
And speaking of our enemies,
it's important...

733
01:10:02,717 --> 01:10:06,596
...that you go back to work
at Cortical Systematics.

734
01:10:06,846 --> 01:10:11,142
We need to maintain as many
agents there as possible.

735
01:10:11,351 --> 01:10:13,895
It's owned by Cortical Systematics?

736
01:10:14,103 --> 01:10:18,649
Yeah. Their corporate slogan should be:
" Enemies of Reality."

737
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,944
Someday soon, we will
destroy trout farm...

738
01:10:22,153 --> 01:10:24,489
...and all game-pods inside.

739
01:10:27,075 --> 01:10:28,660
We love you.

740
01:10:31,203 --> 01:10:36,166
Now that you have proven to be
true and trustworthy Realists.

741
01:10:40,837 --> 01:10:42,839
We'll be in touch.

742
01:11:02,067 --> 01:11:04,236
I'm looking for D'Arcy Nader.
ls he here?

743
01:11:17,416 --> 01:11:21,628
Hugo Carlaw, is D'Arcy Nader here?

744
01:11:23,171 --> 01:11:24,798
He's in the back.

745
01:11:28,593 --> 01:11:31,220
You want him, there he is.

746
01:11:40,563 --> 01:11:43,525
You shouldn't have killed
the Chinese waiter.

747
01:11:44,234 --> 01:11:45,818
Why not?

748
01:11:46,027 --> 01:11:49,531
He was your contact
at the trout farm.

749
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:50,740
Damn good man.

750
01:11:54,244 --> 01:11:55,870
His dog brought me this.

751
01:11:57,246 --> 01:12:00,791
We were contacted by Yevgeny Nourish.
He knew who we were.

752
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,378
Nader told him that you were coming.
Nader was a mole...

753
01:12:04,629 --> 01:12:06,339
...for Cortical Systematics.

754
01:12:07,131 --> 01:12:09,592
You're with the Realist Underground.

755
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:14,138
I was placed here
to keep an eye on Nader.

756
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:18,559
If Nourish isn't our real contact,
who is he?

757
01:12:19,226 --> 01:12:21,812
He's a double agent
for Cortical Systematics.

758
01:12:22,021 --> 01:12:25,441
He was working with Nader
to subvert the Realist cause...

759
01:12:25,691 --> 01:12:30,404
...and doing it rather well. He got
you to assassinate your own contact.

760
01:12:34,909 --> 01:12:37,119
But now you're gonna
put a stop to him.

761
01:12:40,081 --> 01:12:42,123
I don't wanna be here.

762
01:12:43,042 --> 01:12:44,460
Come on, Pikul.

763
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:49,048
You've just got a bad case
of first-time user anxiety.

764
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:50,924
I don't like it here.

765
01:12:51,174 --> 01:12:53,009
I don't know what's going on.

766
01:12:53,259 --> 01:12:57,806
We're both stumbling around together
in this unformed world...

767
01:12:58,056 --> 01:13:00,851
...whose rules and objectives
are largely unknown...

768
01:13:01,059 --> 01:13:04,271
...seemingly indecipherable
or possibly nonexistent...

769
01:13:04,522 --> 01:13:06,147
...always on the verge...

770
01:13:06,398 --> 01:13:10,069
...of being killed by forces
that we don't understand.

771
01:13:10,611 --> 01:13:12,988
That sounds like my game, all right.

772
01:13:13,279 --> 01:13:16,574
That sounds like a game that's
not gonna be easy to market.

773
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:19,661
But it's a game everybody's
already playing.

774
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:36,135
The cashier said it would be
in a familiar place.

775
01:13:37,887 --> 01:13:40,348
Is there such a thing here?

776
01:13:40,598 --> 01:13:42,600
My assembly bay.

777
01:14:13,255 --> 01:14:14,924
Is that it over there?

778
01:14:32,691 --> 01:14:36,612
God, it's ugly even for a game-pod.

779
01:14:38,364 --> 01:14:43,452
I have a terrible urge to port into it.
What about you?

780
01:14:43,661 --> 01:14:48,082
Sure. Yeah.
Desperate to port into it.

781
01:14:57,715 --> 01:14:59,134
All right. Here we go.

782
01:14:59,343 --> 01:15:02,053
-You wanna give me a hand?
-You're not serious!

783
01:15:03,137 --> 01:15:06,058
That's a diseased pod.
You port into that--

784
01:15:06,308 --> 01:15:07,934
Yes, exactly.

785
01:15:09,144 --> 01:15:11,021
Help me.

786
01:15:21,407 --> 01:15:24,617
How long does it take
for the infection to take hold?

787
01:15:27,996 --> 01:15:29,330
No time at all.

788
01:15:31,125 --> 01:15:33,626
Then you quietly port
into the other pods...

789
01:15:34,252 --> 01:15:36,672
...and spread the infection to them.

790
01:15:39,257 --> 01:15:40,633
Oh, God.

791
01:15:42,176 --> 01:15:43,553
What's happening?

792
01:15:44,887 --> 01:15:45,930
Something's wrong.

793
01:15:47,682 --> 01:15:49,600
I'm gonna unport you now.

794
01:15:51,561 --> 01:15:52,979
Oh, God! Don't!

795
01:15:54,063 --> 01:15:55,898
That really hurts.

796
01:15:56,107 --> 01:15:57,942
I'm gonna cut you free.

797
01:16:03,781 --> 01:16:05,450
No! l'm afraid!

798
01:16:30,933 --> 01:16:32,351
Pikul...

799
01:16:33,477 --> 01:16:35,479
...l'm bleeding to death.

800
01:16:47,783 --> 01:16:49,451
I'm sorry.

801
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:52,996
I don't know....

802
01:16:53,205 --> 01:16:54,581
I don't know what else to do!

803
01:16:55,332 --> 01:16:57,042
I know what to do.

804
01:16:57,793 --> 01:16:58,627
I know...

805
01:16:59,544 --> 01:17:01,296
...exactly what to do.

806
01:17:05,467 --> 01:17:06,927
Death to Realism!

807
01:17:10,931 --> 01:17:11,765
Burn!

808
01:17:14,518 --> 01:17:16,603
Burn, diseased pod.

809
01:17:22,274 --> 01:17:23,109
Bugs!

810
01:17:23,818 --> 01:17:26,363
No! No, spores.

811
01:17:26,613 --> 01:17:27,488
Deadly spores.

812
01:17:39,166 --> 01:17:40,042
Spores!

813
01:17:40,251 --> 01:17:42,004
No, it's just....

814
01:17:56,350 --> 01:17:58,602
Death to the demoness!

815
01:17:59,103 --> 01:18:00,271
Demoness!

816
01:18:09,613 --> 01:18:12,325
I think we just lost the game.

817
01:18:19,623 --> 01:18:21,334
Or maybe not.

818
01:18:29,132 --> 01:18:30,343
Allegra...

819
01:18:30,718 --> 01:18:33,053
...we're back home.
We're back home.

820
01:18:33,511 --> 01:18:35,556
Pikul....

821
01:18:37,807 --> 01:18:38,642
What's wrong?

822
01:18:39,434 --> 01:18:40,728
It's here.

823
01:18:43,104 --> 01:18:45,858
It's happened.
lt's come back here with us.

824
01:18:46,734 --> 01:18:48,443
We brought it back
from eXistenZ.

825
01:18:48,693 --> 01:18:50,945
Brought what back?
l can't understand.

826
01:18:51,154 --> 01:18:53,657
We brought the disease
back with us.

827
01:18:53,865 --> 01:18:56,368
My pod is diseased.

828
01:18:56,744 --> 01:18:58,328
Oh, God!

829
01:18:58,536 --> 01:19:00,163
I'm really gonna lose it.

830
01:19:00,372 --> 01:19:02,625
I'm gonna lose my game.

831
01:19:04,709 --> 01:19:06,086
Unport me. Come on.

832
01:19:06,586 --> 01:19:07,837
All right.

833
01:19:08,421 --> 01:19:11,174
Okay. l'm coming.

834
01:19:14,969 --> 01:19:16,846
How can a game event...

835
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:19,516
...merge into real life?

836
01:19:20,350 --> 01:19:24,479
There's a very weird reality-
bleed-through effect happening here.

837
01:19:24,688 --> 01:19:26,606
I'm not sure l get it.

838
01:19:33,153 --> 01:19:34,530
What's in the needle?

839
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:37,242
Sporicide.

840
01:19:37,617 --> 01:19:39,868
Pods are susceptible
to spore infections.

841
01:19:40,078 --> 01:19:41,663
It works if you get it in time.

842
01:19:42,205 --> 01:19:43,664
Come on.

843
01:19:47,961 --> 01:19:49,962
Iet me see your bio-port.

844
01:19:51,381 --> 01:19:52,215
Iet me see it.

845
01:19:54,133 --> 01:19:55,009
What?

846
01:19:56,636 --> 01:19:57,887
I know what happened.

847
01:19:58,137 --> 01:20:01,056
It's Kiri Vinokur.
That bastard.

848
01:20:01,307 --> 01:20:02,142
Vinokur?

849
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:04,184
He gave you a new bio-port.

850
01:20:05,436 --> 01:20:06,437
Oh, God.

851
01:20:07,856 --> 01:20:12,318
He gave you an infected one so that
my pod and my game system would die!

852
01:20:12,526 --> 01:20:14,778
I'm infected?
Wait a minute.

853
01:20:14,987 --> 01:20:19,450
It was saying it was sick by introducing
the theme of disease in the game.

854
01:20:19,658 --> 01:20:23,244
"The theme of disease"?
l'm fucking really infected!

855
01:20:23,454 --> 01:20:25,456
What? ls it gonna rot my brain?

856
01:20:25,664 --> 01:20:30,002
All right. Just calm down.
l've got something that will help you.

857
01:20:36,842 --> 01:20:38,343
Turn around.

858
01:20:40,095 --> 01:20:43,640
I'm gonna seal up your bio-port
with this sporicidal resonator.

859
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:46,602
It uses the Umby pickups for power.

860
01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:50,396
It should cleanse all your
porting channels of infection.

861
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:55,234
It's gonna give you a slight
skin buzz when it's done.

862
01:20:55,693 --> 01:20:57,071
We can't play until then.

863
01:20:57,821 --> 01:20:58,655
Great.

864
01:20:59,530 --> 01:21:00,365
Now listen.

865
01:21:01,282 --> 01:21:02,159
Iisten.

866
01:21:03,368 --> 01:21:08,498
This could be critical.
Were you really saying that Vinokur...

867
01:21:08,706 --> 01:21:11,459
-...is an agent for--
-Oh, God!

868
01:21:11,668 --> 01:21:12,795
Pikul...

869
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:15,046
...my pod's dying.

870
01:21:16,172 --> 01:21:18,217
I can't help it.
There's nothing...

871
01:21:18,425 --> 01:21:20,259
...l can do for it.

872
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,405
The uprising has begun!

873
01:21:40,613 --> 01:21:42,949
The world is in flames!
Let's go!

874
01:21:43,157 --> 01:21:44,909
You gotta get out of here!

875
01:21:45,118 --> 01:21:46,536
The cashier...

876
01:21:47,036 --> 01:21:48,829
...from the game.
How can he be here?

877
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:51,124
Ieave that here.
lt's done its job.

878
01:21:51,332 --> 01:21:54,334
I keep my game inside there!
l can't let my game die!

879
01:21:54,543 --> 01:21:55,920
No! Wait!

880
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:13,438
Allegra! Listen to me.
Listen to me.

881
01:22:14,479 --> 01:22:16,064
We're still inside the game.

882
01:22:16,732 --> 01:22:19,735
I think your pod's
out there somewhere safe.

883
01:22:19,943 --> 01:22:22,822
I think it's all right
to let go of this pod.

884
01:22:23,031 --> 01:22:24,656
It's not the real one.

885
01:22:29,745 --> 01:22:30,579
Everybody out!

886
01:22:30,787 --> 01:22:31,621
Now!

887
01:22:38,712 --> 01:22:42,215
This way! Come on!
Follow me!

888
01:22:45,844 --> 01:22:47,846
This way. Come on.

889
01:22:49,931 --> 01:22:51,391
Up here.

890
01:22:56,688 --> 01:22:58,523
You can see everything
from here!

891
01:22:58,774 --> 01:23:00,066
What are we seeing?

892
01:23:00,524 --> 01:23:02,986
The victory of Realism.

893
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:05,196
You were part of it.

894
01:23:08,575 --> 01:23:12,245
The death of eXistenZ.
And we were part of it.

895
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:16,832
There's just one more thing.

896
01:23:18,794 --> 01:23:19,960
We're on your side.

897
01:23:21,629 --> 01:23:23,131
How could you be?

898
01:23:23,382 --> 01:23:25,257
How could Allegra Geller...

899
01:23:25,466 --> 01:23:28,595
...the world's premier game designer,
be on our side?

900
01:23:29,345 --> 01:23:33,642
Yeah, we know who you are. But you
can't hide inside a game forever.

901
01:23:34,392 --> 01:23:36,102
Something slipped
over the edge.

902
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:37,520
Something's wrong.

903
01:23:39,022 --> 01:23:41,357
See what l mean?
See the problem?

904
01:23:58,457 --> 01:24:01,752
I tried to find you.
Thank God l got here in time.

905
01:24:01,961 --> 01:24:04,088
My dog brought me this.

906
01:24:05,505 --> 01:24:07,883
You didn't get here in time.

907
01:24:08,217 --> 01:24:09,801
My game is dead.

908
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:12,263
You murdered my game!

909
01:24:12,471 --> 01:24:16,600
No, l murdered your pod.
Your game...

910
01:24:16,809 --> 01:24:18,811
...is healthy and happy.

911
01:24:19,894 --> 01:24:21,271
I replicated...

912
01:24:21,521 --> 01:24:25,317
...your pod's entire nervous system
during our surgical procedure...

913
01:24:25,525 --> 01:24:28,696
...at the chalet,
complete with contents.

914
01:24:31,031 --> 01:24:33,034
You copied eXistenZ?

915
01:24:35,744 --> 01:24:36,703
Allegra...

916
01:24:38,246 --> 01:24:41,082
...come over to Cortical Systematics.

917
01:24:41,791 --> 01:24:44,253
Yes, Cortical Systematics.

918
01:24:44,502 --> 01:24:47,505
I am defecting, and
so are all Antenna top brass.

919
01:24:48,048 --> 01:24:49,883
You're a spy for Cortical?

920
01:24:50,425 --> 01:24:53,470
If you want to be reunited
with your baby, you'll come.

921
01:25:05,899 --> 01:25:06,983
Can you talk to her?

922
01:25:07,442 --> 01:25:10,194
It would be best for everyone.

923
01:25:10,987 --> 01:25:13,031
I mean, you can come with us too.

924
01:25:22,999 --> 01:25:24,209
What are you doing?

925
01:25:26,585 --> 01:25:28,004
You've killed him.

926
01:25:30,965 --> 01:25:32,968
Are you gonna kill me next?

927
01:25:35,344 --> 01:25:37,137
He was only a game character.

928
01:25:37,346 --> 01:25:39,641
I didn't like how he was
messing with me.

929
01:25:39,848 --> 01:25:42,393
You didn't like that,
so you killed him?

930
01:25:43,853 --> 01:25:46,146
He's only a game character.

931
01:25:48,107 --> 01:25:50,317
What if we're not
in the game anymore?

932
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:55,531
If we're not....

933
01:25:56,824 --> 01:25:58,242
If we're not...

934
01:25:59,326 --> 01:26:00,869
...you killed someone real.

935
01:26:07,376 --> 01:26:10,086
It was no accident we ended up
on the run together.

936
01:26:11,839 --> 01:26:13,090
Not an accident?

937
01:26:14,383 --> 01:26:15,216
No.

938
01:26:17,928 --> 01:26:21,515
That's why you never had a bio-port.
You were one of them.

939
01:26:22,433 --> 01:26:24,059
I still am one of them.

940
01:26:25,643 --> 01:26:27,354
But you have a bio-port now.

941
01:26:27,563 --> 01:26:30,940
I made the bio-port sacrifice
to get close to you.

942
01:26:31,149 --> 01:26:32,443
Why would you do that?

943
01:26:33,444 --> 01:26:35,778
To understand what l have to kill.

944
01:26:36,487 --> 01:26:38,282
Then understand this.

945
01:26:39,158 --> 01:26:40,325
I knew...

946
01:26:40,533 --> 01:26:45,246
...you were my real assassin when you
pointed the gun at me in the restaurant.

947
01:26:45,455 --> 01:26:46,873
And understand that...

948
01:26:48,876 --> 01:26:50,085
...you're dead.

949
01:26:57,550 --> 01:27:01,638
Death to the demon Ted Pikul!

950
01:27:06,934 --> 01:27:08,311
Have l won?

951
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:10,730
Have l won the game?

952
01:27:12,774 --> 01:27:14,359
Have l won?

953
01:27:56,233 --> 01:27:57,943
Are you all back?

954
01:27:59,612 --> 01:28:01,446
We're back.

955
01:28:01,655 --> 01:28:03,949
We're back, Merle...

956
01:28:04,157 --> 01:28:08,328
...but l have a feeling some of
our crew doesn't realize it yet.

957
01:28:12,582 --> 01:28:15,503
Anybody want a bowl
of hot and sour soup?

958
01:28:15,711 --> 01:28:17,129
It's on me.

959
01:28:19,464 --> 01:28:20,882
Yes, l'll have some.

960
01:28:21,258 --> 01:28:26,013
If you make sure there's some mutated
amphibian nervous systems in the rice.

961
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:31,225
My accent in the game was so thick,
l could hardly understand myself.

962
01:28:32,519 --> 01:28:34,938
-How long were we gone?
-About 20 minutes.

963
01:28:35,147 --> 01:28:37,399
God, it seemed like days.
lt's fantastic.

964
01:28:37,607 --> 01:28:39,651
Just think about it, man.

965
01:28:39,901 --> 01:28:43,071
If you stayed your whole life
in the game world...

966
01:28:43,488 --> 01:28:46,657
...you could live to about,
l don't know, 500 years.

967
01:28:47,533 --> 01:28:51,078
The twists and turns at the end
made my head spin.

968
01:28:51,287 --> 01:28:54,333
Maybe there was too many,
too fast to absorb.

969
01:28:55,334 --> 01:28:57,877
I sucked.
You guys were great.

970
01:28:58,085 --> 01:29:00,339
I mean, you were like game divas.

971
01:29:00,547 --> 01:29:03,591
Personally, l think you both
deserve to win.

972
01:29:11,182 --> 01:29:14,810
I was bummed out at first.
l got knocked out of the game so soon.

973
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:17,563
It was fantastic how mean you were.

974
01:29:17,772 --> 01:29:19,899
Really scary and crazy.

975
01:29:20,149 --> 01:29:23,527
I had a lot to do in the church,
but the character was boring.

976
01:29:25,613 --> 01:29:27,823
Well, no matter how boring you were...

977
01:29:28,074 --> 01:29:32,453
...you still all get a certificate
for helping us out here and....

978
01:29:32,703 --> 01:29:34,246
Am l right, Merle?

979
01:29:34,455 --> 01:29:37,792
Yes. And that will entitle
you to reserve one of the first...

980
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,586
...of the transCendenZ game modules...

981
01:29:40,836 --> 01:29:44,131
...at a seriously discounted price.
You're gonna love it.

982
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:46,591
Remember, it's written like this:

983
01:29:46,841 --> 01:29:49,261
Capital "C," capital "Z."
transCendenZ.

984
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:54,100
It's new from Pilgrlmage, capital "P,"
capital "l," and it's coming soon.

985
01:29:55,101 --> 01:29:58,479
I just wanted to say thank you
to Mr. Nourish...

986
01:29:58,729 --> 01:30:03,316
...for giving me the chance to play
the role of a star designer.

987
01:30:03,566 --> 01:30:06,945
I guess the game picked up
on my ambition to be like you.

988
01:30:07,153 --> 01:30:10,366
Allegra, you were so good
in that role, l suspect...

989
01:30:10,574 --> 01:30:15,162
...it won't be long before Pilgrlmage
is after you to sign a design contract.

990
01:30:15,413 --> 01:30:19,332
And maybe you should bring along
your friend, Mr. Pikul.

991
01:30:19,582 --> 01:30:24,337
He's good in a crisis. And when you
design games, there's plenty of those.

992
01:30:25,798 --> 01:30:29,134
I guess you could tell that
Pikul and l had a relationship...

993
01:30:29,384 --> 01:30:32,429
...prior to coming here.
We do like to play together.

994
01:30:33,471 --> 01:30:34,306
We do.

995
01:30:34,514 --> 01:30:38,101
But l'd just like to
assure everybody here that...

996
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:42,856
...Allegra wouldn't really jump
into bed with a security guard.

997
01:30:43,064 --> 01:30:44,065
Unless he were me.

998
01:30:47,027 --> 01:30:49,154
What do we have to say
to our brilliant...

999
01:30:49,404 --> 01:30:51,156
...designer, Yevgeny Nourish?

1000
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:54,159
Does he have another winner
on his hands or not?

1001
01:31:11,508 --> 01:31:14,638
I was very disturbed
by the game we just played.

1002
01:31:15,930 --> 01:31:16,764
What do you mean?

1003
01:31:17,264 --> 01:31:20,352
It had a very strong,
very real anti-game theme.

1004
01:31:21,353 --> 01:31:24,396
It began with the attempted
assassination of a designer.

1005
01:31:25,106 --> 01:31:27,024
Really? That's very creative.

1006
01:31:30,904 --> 01:31:34,281
On second thought, l see what you mean.
lt makes me nervous.

1007
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:37,242
You think this must've come
from one of our game players?

1008
01:31:37,451 --> 01:31:40,120
Well, it sure didn't come from me.

1009
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:45,167
Iet's probe it when
we do the focus group.

1010
01:31:47,795 --> 01:31:51,090
Thank you for looking after my dog.

1011
01:32:06,188 --> 01:32:09,274
We just wanted to ask
Mr. Nourish some questions.

1012
01:32:10,776 --> 01:32:12,193
Sure. Shoot.

1013
01:32:12,986 --> 01:32:15,739
Just don't ask me
to fill in your questionnaires.

1014
01:32:19,033 --> 01:32:20,202
We've played your game...

1015
01:32:20,411 --> 01:32:24,915
...so we can finally agree that you
are the world's greatest game artist.

1016
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:28,710
We weren't sure before.

1017
01:32:30,504 --> 01:32:31,588
Thanks so much.

1018
01:32:31,797 --> 01:32:32,964
Yevgeny?

1019
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:38,303
Don't you think you should suffer for
the harm you've done to the human race?

1020
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:40,305
What?

1021
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:46,144
Don't you think the greatest
game artist ought to be punished...

1022
01:32:46,603 --> 01:32:50,690
...for the most effective
deforming of reality?

1023
01:32:51,316 --> 01:32:52,483
I don't think this--

1024
01:32:52,692 --> 01:32:54,694
Guys, can you come over here now?

1025
01:33:12,252 --> 01:33:15,965
Death to the demon Yevgeny Nourish!

1026
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:18,508
Death to Pilgrlmage!

1027
01:33:18,717 --> 01:33:22,262
Death to transCendenZ!

1028
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:44,242
No, no, no!
You don't have to shoot me!

1029
01:33:47,955 --> 01:33:50,207
Hey, tell me the truth.

1030
01:33:50,457 --> 01:33:51,876
Are we still in the game?

1031
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,088
