2
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,297
My name is Chen Su Ting

3
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,180
I was born in 1958

4
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,180
My Mother was the Second Wife

5
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,624
As the First Wife was unable to conceive,

6
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,711
she allowed Father to marry Mother

7
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,538
However after marriage,

8
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,308
Mother gave birth to three girls consecutively

9
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,279
It was a time when giving birth to girls

10
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,340
was as good as infertility

11
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,496
Shortly after Father passed away,

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,095
on August 9, 1965

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,675
We were chased out of the house

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,069
We did not have a choice

15
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,973
but to return to Grandfather's
house at the countryside

16
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,222
Those were times where
the society was patriarchy

17
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,639
and highly superstitious

18
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,117
According to those gossip mongers,

19
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,153
Mother's fortune clashed with Grandfather's

20
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,627
As such, she had to
address him as Fourth Uncle

21
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,814
Fourth Uncle

22
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,639
Short-lived scroundel!

23
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,887
You got chased out just like that?

24
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,636
Three girls one after another,

25
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,158
If I was the First Wife,

26
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,167
I would chased you out too!

27
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,449
Greet your Grandfather

28
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,864
Grandfather

29
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,270
After you got married to
the coffeeshop's Boss,

30
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,822
besides the dowry received,

31
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,593
I thought you would help
with our family expenses

32
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,871
Instead, you some back empty-handed,

33
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,418
without a coffee bean in sight

34
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,027
Now that your husband has passed on,

35
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,509
and with you pregnant,

36
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,161
you actually brought your kids back to us'?

37
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,509
Do you think I'm dead?

38
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,218
Sis, you brought the kids back?

39
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,953
You think it's easy managing the household?

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,910
I have three sons and a wife,

41
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,236
our parents and our brother
sleeping in the other room

42
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,822
What are we to eat if you are here to stay'?

43
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,559
Eat shit with rice or rice with shit?

44
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,903
Why don't we just eat shit? Eat shit!

45
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,677
<i>Dear...</i>

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,643
Sis is quite pitiable with no roof over her head

47
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,466
Pitiful?

48
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,597
Why don't you move out for her to stay'?

49
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,852
We will see who is in a more pitiful state

50
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,703
I was talking nonsense

51
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,355
Ah Kun, Fourth Uncle

52
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,111
Please be rest assured,

53
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,572
I will not be a free loader

54
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,271
I am pregnant now. I don't
know when I will deliver loo

55
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,206
The kids are still young

56
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,174
I need a place for them to stay temporarily

57
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,080
A house to shelther them

58
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,531
Shelter them?

59
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,898
See for yourself how big our house is?

60
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,422
You have a look yourself

61
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,072
Come, come Follow me

62
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,809
See how huge it is

63
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,671
Have a look around

64
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,660
Tell me, is there room
for you to move back in'?

65
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,190
Are you going to sleep in
the bathroom? Or the toilet?

66
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,543
Why not the kitchen?

67
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,996
Fourth Aunt

68
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,185
Zhao Di, you are really moving back?

69
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,385
Yes, I am giving birth soon.
I'll need a place to say

70
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,441
The kids are still young

71
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,669
It is fine for us to sleep in the kitchen

72
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,598
You are going to give birth soon,

73
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,631
How can the kitchen be a confinement roam?

74
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,039
That will not do

75
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,388
The kitchen as a confinement room?

76
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,726
We guys, won't be able to enter then

77
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,553
You know how dirty a confinement room is

78
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,399
Won't our fortunes clash if we entered?

79
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,448
Everything you do is for yourself

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,105
Fourth Uncle, Please let me stay

81
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,439
I will get a job as soon as I have given birth

82
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,999
I'll help out with family expenses

83
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,990
You can trust me

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,957
I will contribute to this family

85
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,719
Sis, You are that free?

86
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,721
Right

87
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,439
Ah Hee, tidy your room

88
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,283
Let your sister stay with the children

89
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,856
Why my room?

90
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,133
Where shall I sleep then?

91
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,599
You sleep with your nephews

92
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,119
This makes no sense

93
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,158
Be good. When we apply for our flat,

94
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,231
I will leave the biggest room for you

95
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,942
I don't want

96
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,904
Be good. Listen

97
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,649
Why is it always me?

98
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,523
That's great

99
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,717
Going to give birth soon?

100
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,734
Mother, are you feeling okay?

101
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,489
Hurry, let's get her to the hospital

102
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,273
(Kandang Kerbau Hospital)

103
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,015
Push. Put more effort

104
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,769
Push. Push

105
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,862
Be quiet. Stop screaming

106
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,076
Don't see you complaining
when you were doing it

107
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,373
Girl

108
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,062
Girl

109
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,402
Oh God

110
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,294
Why give me another daughter?

111
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,938
I already have three

112
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,812
God, stop making a fool of me

113
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,511
Stop playing tricks on me

114
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,716
Oh God

115
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,374
There is another one?

116
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,310
Doctor, there is another one!

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,446
One more'? There is another'?

118
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,109
Push

119
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,167
More strength

120
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,478
Congratulations, it is a boy

121
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,449
Congratulations, it is a boy

122
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,629
That was how our brother and sister

123
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,211
came to this world

124
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,260
It was on August 9th

125
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,988
that they were born

126
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,737
On the same day

127
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,069
Singapore's troubles

128
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,605
were born too

129
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,168
Singapore and Malaysia

130
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,749
separated

131
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,285
Thank you. Thank you

132
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,359
You are back

133
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,180
Congratulations

134
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,669
It's twins

135
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,239
Yes, one male one female

136
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,311
This one with the two moles,
is it male or female?

137
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,062
The one with two moles is the girl

138
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,873
The one with a mole is the boy?

139
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,235
Yes

140
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,237
This boy is so cute

141
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,294
Move aside. Let me through

142
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,824
You cannot enter. This is a confinement room

143
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,166
This is originally my room

144
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,107
It is not now

145
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,110
You are nut allowed to enter

146
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,007
You won't grow up if you entered

147
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,628
That is ridiculous

148
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,325
The two moles on your granddaughter's face,

149
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,789
The one here

150
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,677
is called the 'homewreck mole'

151
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,302
Homewreck mole'?

152
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,324
The one on the forehead

153
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,521
is more dangerous

154
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,128
It will bring about calamities

155
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,479
Two moles and none is good?

156
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,982
Haw about my other grandchild?

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,673
The grandson with one mole'?

158
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,611
That mole is the "prosperous" mole

159
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,709
He will be rich and prosperous in future

160
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,336
Lucky one turned cut fine

161
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,892
Thank you, Goddess Guanyin

162
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,559
I still have something to add on

163
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,198
Don't mind me being nosey

164
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,089
The granddaughter with two moles

165
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,157
In the olden times,

166
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,919
we would have strangled her to death

167
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,326
That is right

168
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,910
Excuse me

169
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,797
My fortune doesn't bode well today,

170
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,824
I am worried there will be a clash of fortunes

171
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,318
I will make a move first

172
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,795
I shall be going too

173
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,239
ls it that serious?

174
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,150
Yes

175
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,559
You are really going to strangle her'?

176
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,971
I will think about it

177
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,925
Are you really considering it?

178
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,343
I am thinking of a solution

179
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,961
You scared me there

180
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,926
Who tripped again?

181
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,007
What happened?

182
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,422
He tripped

183
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,479
Tripped again?

184
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,538
It's nothing

185
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,564
Move aside. Move aside

186
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,049
Zhao Di, Take a lock

187
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,509
I am not being superstitious

188
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,467
Once you returned with your daughter,

189
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,676
Ah Hai fell and injured his head

190
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,919
Are you mad?

191
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,901
She just returned and is still in confinement

192
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,887
That is your grandchild

193
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,558
So are these two over here

194
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,903
That's not true

195
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,412
Ah Hai carries the surname
'Lim', he is our grandchild

196
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,346
Her daughter follows the surname of others,

197
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,629
therefore she is an outsider

198
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,134
You are old and meddlesome

199
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,247
Talking rubbish

200
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,079
Let me set this straight

201
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,207
If you want to stay here,

202
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,412
you have to send your daughter away

203
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,883
If your daughter doesn't go,

204
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,649
your family isn't welcome either

205
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,780
I am doing this fur the safety of our family

206
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,046
Not because I am superstitious

207
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,957
The kids are newborn!

208
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,466
You think I'm blind'? That I can't see!

209
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,567
What do you kids know?

210
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,789
Get out!

211
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,440
Sis, She is your daughter

212
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,113
You should know what to do

213
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,020
Let's net make everyone upset

214
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,121
Stop crying already

215
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,366
Dab your wound with incense ash

216
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,795
Let's go

217
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,756
In order for us to stay,

218
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,195
Mother went to work as a laundry washer

219
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,191
before she finished her confinement

220
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,522
The money earned were our living expenses

221
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,191
Lady Boss

222
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,103
Why are you here?

223
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,252
Don't call me that anymore

224
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,862
I am no longer the Lady Boss

225
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,041
Why is that so?

226
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,629
You helped me sell my Nasi Lemak
at the coffee shop in the past

227
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,568
If you need any help,

228
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,453
I will definitely help you

229
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,423
Thank you, Osman

230
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,380
You are doing laundry for others?

231
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,316
I just gave birth to a pair of twins

232
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,094
The burden is greater now

233
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,054
No worries

234
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,000
I will help you

235
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,297
<i>I wash...</i>

236
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,207
Do the laundry

237
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,549
I am best at laundry

238
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,213
I will introduce a friend to you later

239
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,954
He knows how to make bean curd and say milk

240
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,567
You can learn from him

241
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,038
That way, we can do business together

242
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,335
No one sells soy milk at the market

243
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,203
You interested?

244
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,578
<i>Yes, oi course</i>

245
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,102
Thank you

246
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,876
You're welcome

247
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,195
I cannot wash this

248
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,884
And this

249
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,658
I have already washed them

250
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,694
Already washed?

251
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,616
Already washed

252
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,502
With Uncle Osman's help,

253
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,081
Mother learn how to make
bean curd and soy milk

254
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,590
She kept practicing on her recipe

255
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,982
It wasn't long before she
decided to set up a stall

256
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,334
Ah Hee. Why so glum?

257
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,610
Because I got you to help out'?

258
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,198
NO

259
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,990
Tell me why then

260
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,380
Why did you stop studying at Secondary Two?

261
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,441
Why didn't you complete
your Secondary education?

262
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,454
I am not academically inclined

263
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,800
I am stupid. Didn't you know?

264
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,656
Haw can my brother be stupid?

265
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,191
Haw about this?

266
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,153
For helping me out at the stall today,

267
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,356
I will give you a portion of the earnings

268
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,780
Really?

269
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,879
Don't lie to me

270
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,109
When have I ever lied to you?

271
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,837
Cheap and delicious. Have a look

272
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,513
Come and take a look

273
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,454
Be serious. Stop fooling around

274
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,532
Nasi Lemak

275
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,184
Zhao Di

276
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,935
Osman, Fatimah

277
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,997
Come over here

278
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,134
Please push it more to the front

279
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,548
Thank you

280
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,574
Over here

281
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,654
Welcome, welcome

282
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,211
Thank you

283
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,493
This is a strategic location

284
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,429
Hubby

285
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,327
I need help

286
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,891
She's calling for me

287
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,744
Thanks

288
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,694
Look. Their business is booming

289
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,279
That's for sure. They've
been in business for so long

290
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,987
Today is just our first day

291
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,858
Business is here

292
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,007
One cup of soy milk?

293
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,426
Stir it

294
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,311
New here?

295
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,287
Yes

296
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,596
Soy milk or bean curd for you?

297
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,273
Beancurd

298
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,879
I love bean curd

299
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,415
Careful. It's hot

300
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,496
The health inspectors are here

301
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,422
These people in uniforms,

302
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,676
that everyone is frightened of

303
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,755
Their nicknames

304
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,308
are the Cattles (Health inspectors)

305
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,639
Loose cattles (Hiding from the inspectors)

306
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,584
was a problem

307
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,420
faced by the hawkers

308
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,159
All the hawkers at the market

309
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,123
do this for a livelihood

310
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,856
Why did the government

311
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,119
send the Health Inspectors

312
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,645
to harass us'?

313
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,070
We were merely trying to run a small business

314
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,702
but we are now reduced to running like thieves

315
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,833
Besides the Health Inspectors,

316
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,736
we also had to face the
harassment of gangsters

317
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,412
They demand for protection fees frequently

318
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,500
There were Police then,

319
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,239
But they were never present

320
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,446
whenever the gangsters strike

321
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,216
And when the gangsters strike,

322
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,647
the Police were never here

323
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,372
Business is here

324
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,016
Bean curd or soy milk?

325
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,029
Five cups?

326
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,735
Five cups of bean curd or soy milk?

327
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,007
I will give you five slaps

328
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,493
You're new here?

329
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,380
Haven't you heard

330
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,049
whose territory is this?

331
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,605
This is 706's territory

332
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,229
It's five dollars, not five cups

333
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,207
What is left for us to earn then?

334
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,093
What is left'?

335
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,519
Bosses, please don't flare up

336
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,399
Brothers of 706,

337
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,959
We just started our business,
we don't have that much

338
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,760
Here, here

339
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,875
A dollar for you to have tea

340
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,824
A dollar'?

341
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,639
You think we are beggars?

342
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,967
Settle this

343
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,894
Hit him

344
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,641
Stop it

345
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,490
Don't hit my brother

346
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,219
Police! Police!

347
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,239
Cucumber

348
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,241
Delicious

349
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,706
Stop it

350
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:12,423
Don't hit my brother

351
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,311
That's enough

352
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,487
Stop it

353
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,184
Don't hit women!

354
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,126
Don't embarrass 706

355
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,278
Let me tell you

356
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,594
If you want to do business here,

357
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,675
you need to pay protection fees

358
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,614
Two days

359
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,388
I will give you two days

360
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,454
I'll be back

361
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:31,838
Let's go

362
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,840
Mather,

363
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,692
You couldn't bear to hit
us when we were young

364
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,093
You can tell he was hit
by a bamboo or sugar cane

365
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,953
Luckily I didn't help out at the stall

366
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,019
Those scoundrels did this to you

367
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,856
If you became a cripple,

368
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,542
you would be finished

369
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,681
Ah Hee got beaten up'?

370
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,161
You can't even take care of your own brother?

371
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,180
He helped you out

372
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,486
and got a beating

373
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,183
What kind of sister are you?

374
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,714
She did take care of me

375
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,246
To save me,

376
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,782
she got beaten up

377
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,693
See for yourself

378
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,687
The medicated oil is about to finish

379
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,537
I will go to Thye Shan Medical
Hall to get a bottle tomorrow

380
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,238
No need for the hassle

381
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,636
You can just get one from
the village medical shop

382
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,402
Fourth Aunt. We must be
careful when buying medicine

383
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,062
Thye Shan Medical Hall is trustworthy

384
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,014
They are reputable and honest

385
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,678
I will also buy some herbs to boost his health

386
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,700
I am worried he will get internal injuries

387
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,791
It will be terrible if he
suffer future complications

388
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,115
Sis, It's okay

389
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,590
I am fine

390
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,624
You apply some medicine too

391
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,347
You got beaten up too

392
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,553
Your condition is no better than mine

393
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,528
If you weren't rash, would
I have gotten injured?

394
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,125
You need to be tolerant

395
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,064
Look

396
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,231
I got a divination lot from Goddess Guanyin

397
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,845
The worst draw

398
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,047
This is terrible

399
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,525
It's the worst draw I've seen

400
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,350
Fourth Uncle, how can you
trust a divination lot?

401
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,361
This is not from me,

402
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,515
this is what the Goddess Guan Yin said

403
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,745
I have never gotten such a terrible draw

404
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:10,838
Also.

405
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,634
Your daughter's birth characters

406
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,671
clashes with our entire family's

407
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,486
Where do you want us to move to?

408
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,126
You need to give me some time

409
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,015
I will contribute to the family

410
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,818
Contribute?

411
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,793
My eldest grandson injured his head

412
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,887
Yuu call that contribution?

413
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,696
Ah Hee almost became crippled

414
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,664
Yuu call that contribution?

415
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,319
It is more like implication

416
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,500
Dear, let me tell you,

417
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,732
as elders of the family,

418
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,380
<i>we</i> shall <i>make the decision</i>

419
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,938
The car is here. Everyone, out here

420
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,699
The couple has got good fortune

421
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,857
This boss has hundred of
hectares of rubber plantations

422
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,540
Look at their luxury car

423
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,142
You need not worry,

424
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,639
just hand your child over to them

425
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,199
You will have good fortune in future

426
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,476
Your child will have a good life too

427
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,864
Don't be heartbroken

428
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,709
You've done two good deeds today

429
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,671
Firstly.

430
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,593
Your family will be safe

431
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,557
and your lives will be smooth sailing

432
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,318
Secondly,

433
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,596
the couple were married for years

434
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,698
but never had a child

435
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,302
By giving them your child,

436
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,993
you are blessing them

437
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,179
with luck of fertility

438
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,368
Hurry and give them the child

439
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,613
Hurry

440
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,944
She's adorable

441
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,856
We gave away my younger sister, Su Fang

442
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,550
For us to continue living at Fourth Uncle's,

443
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,517
Mother had no choice

444
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,383
but to listen to him and give her away

445
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,532
Who can understand our pain'?

446
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,835
And who will be willing
to give their child away'?

447
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,647
Su Fang was sacrificed

448
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,879
That was the 'contribution'

449
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,553
Mother and Su Fang made to our family

450
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,669
Hence, we were allowed

451
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,484
to continue living at Fourth Uncle's

452
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,376
We finally felt a sense of belonging

453
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,636
(1966 year end)

454
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,637
(Identity Card Registration)

455
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,951
Sense of belonging?

456
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,839
How much is it worth?

457
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,978
Can we eat it?

458
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,525
Seriously, if living gets too tough

459
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,599
I will run back to Malaysia

460
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,078
Look

461
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,622
In the past

462
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,835
you could return to Malaysia when you wish to

463
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,285
Now you need a passport

464
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:01,912
How troublesome

465
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,623
What is a passport'?

466
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,190
It works like this

467
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,266
We are separate countries from Malaysia now

468
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,022
After our registration as Singaporeans

469
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,145
In the future we need a
passport to enter Malaysia

470
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,643
Twisting of words

471
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,627
We joined Malaysia for better lives

472
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,938
But it wasn't long before we got kicked out

473
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,633
Soon we have to buy drinking water

474
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,278
What if they were in a bad mood

475
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:24,959
and refused to sell it to us?

476
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,428
Drink from the drains?

477
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,703
Impossible

478
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,188
Lee Kuan Yew said

479
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,646
We'll declare war if Malaysia
cuts our water supply

480
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,318
We will fight it out with them

481
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,958
Go to war for water?

482
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,910
That's right

483
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,082
Cutting our water supply means war

484
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,235
We need to fight them

485
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,184
What do we fight them with?

486
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,668
Our buttocks?

487
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,170
They may be equipped with tanks

488
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,038
What do we have?

489
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,919
Fight them with our night-soil carts?

490
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,649
You are really uncouth

491
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,308
All that comes from your mouth is shit

492
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,344
Honestly

493
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,260
Lee Kuan Yew isn't that capable

494
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,499
He cried on television during his speech

495
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,578
You think he was truly upset?

496
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,897
It was because Malaysia

497
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,433
saw Singapore as a piece of barren land

498
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,266
and threw it back to him

499
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,359
He got so flustered

500
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,623
that he cried

501
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,198
Honestly

502
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,992
The crying ones should be us civilians

503
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,468
You are so unhappy with Lee Kuan Yew

504
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,038
don't register for citizenship

505
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,491
Just go back to Malaysia

506
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,863
If the Chinese here weren't the majority

507
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,837
do you think I would waste
my time queuing here?

508
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,519
Dear

509
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,397
a lot of my relatives are in Malaysia

510
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,095
why don't we live in Malaysia as well?

511
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,469
The Malaysian government promised that

512
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,380
they will give land to the Malays

513
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,233
and safeguard our children's future

514
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,136
There are more Malays
there, won't you like that?

515
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,865
My mother gave birth to me here

516
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,622
Most of the friends that I know are here

517
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,812
if we moved there

518
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,592
We have to begin our lives from the start

519
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,819
Who will come to help when I need it'?

520
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,984
The Malaysian Government is confident
that they are able to help us

521
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,934
They have vast resources

522
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,429
There's rubber plantation

523
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,760
There's oil

524
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,839
There are tin mines

525
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,841
They have everything

526
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,793
Our children's future will be brighter

527
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,656
We can have more children if we're there

528
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,842
We already have five

529
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,733
How many mare do you want'?

530
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,519
Ten

531
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,658
Ten?

532
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,239
You think I am a machine?

533
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,193
Dear, look at the neighbor
next door. 12 children

534
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,543
Another has got 15 children

535
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,289
Enough children to form a football team

536
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,072
We only have a table tennis team

537
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,309
Just five. How is that enough?

538
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,197
That's enough, enough!

539
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,567
If you want to go, go by yourself

540
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,785
If you want more kids, you may have more

541
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,656
Alive or dead, I will still be here

542
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,559
If you leave, I can get three more wives

543
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,282
Are you trying to flirt? Are you crazy?

544
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,463
You're already have a lot of children!

545
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,891
Eh! What's this? Are you out of your mind?

546
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,696
After we became Singapore citizens

547
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,553
our lives did not have a big difference

548
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,369
Everything remains unchanged

549
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,743
Until. .

550
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,129
National Service registration
starts from the 28th this month

551
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:56,975
Male citizens born between
1st January and 30th June 1949

552
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,729
have to register as per scheduled date.

553
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,898
BOSS

554
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,622
What's with the crowd?

555
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,755
Which year was your brother born in?

556
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,676
Him?

557
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,158
Congratulations

558
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,618
The government is enlisting
your brother for army

559
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,721
Army?

560
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,270
(February 1963)

561
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,411
Chin Joo Soon

562
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,892
Anan Krishnan

563
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,423
Lim Ah Hee

564
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,283
Muthu Samudin

565
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,797
Tan Ah Kao

566
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,569
All three of you are Tan Ah Kao?

567
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,906
Chim Swee Khoon

568
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,262
The whole lot of you take your belongings

569
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,361
And board the tonner

570
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,136
Move along, up that military tonner

571
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,304
All up the tonner

572
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,909
Why must Lee Kuan Yew

573
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,879
send all the young men to army?

574
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,713
With the British Army gone, how
will my provision shop survive?

575
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,153
What are you recording?

576
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,559
The toners plate number

577
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,326
I will place my bets with Cannon later (illegal)

578
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,465
He allows me to do monthly credit

579
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,118
Don't gamble too much

580
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,269
I know

581
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,847
Just like that, Uncle Ah Hee went to army

582
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,669
The British Army were withdrawing
their troops gradually

583
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,469
Therefore we started our own armed forces

584
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,088
as we are an independent country now

585
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,058
Handle the offerings with care

586
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,128
What are these'?

587
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,388
These?

588
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,391
I think the elections are coming

589
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,618
Elections?

590
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,869
What is an election?

591
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,568
I am not too sure

592
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,879
All of us have to vote for someone

593
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,918
and the chosen one has to help everyone

594
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,380
Everybody has to choose one person?

595
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,479
That person must really be capable

596
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,692
When Shun Fa grows up

597
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,319
he must become that capable person

598
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,287
What about me?

599
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,435
And me'?

600
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,024
We are women

601
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,111
This is a job for the men

602
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,191
Women only need to bear children

603
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,838
Stay home to do the chores
and look after the children

604
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,109
Understand?

605
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,704
Walk faster

606
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,711
May Goddess Guanyin bless
Shun Fa with good grades

607
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,961
and our family's safety and well-being

608
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,601
Careful

626
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,646
Goddess Guanyin

627
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,772
Thanks for bestowing a boy on me

628
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,265
Please bless Shun Fa with good health

629
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,958
and excellence in his studies

630
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,262
Please also bless that Su Fang

631
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,896
will be able to ward off and avert disasters

632
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,025
after she has reached their house

633
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,079
so that when she grows
up, she won't blame me

634
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,548
for not being able to take care of her

635
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,519
Goddess Guanyin

636
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,182
Please bless that our village

637
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,747
will not be acquired so soon

638
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,018
I don't have savings and
Central Provident Funds (CPF)

639
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,580
Goddess Guanyin

640
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,830
I still have many requests

641
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,440
Let me think through it first

642
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,965
Let me think

643
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,666
Goddess Guanyin

644
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,342
Please bless that everything is smooth-sailing

645
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,317
<i>for me, my Mother</i>

646
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,521
and the gang of 706

647
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,751
Also bless those unwilling
to pay protection fees

648
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,704
to be voluntary in payment

649
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,463
so I don't need to use force

650
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,062
to get them to pay

651
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,343
That is sinful

652
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,338
Also Goddess Guanyin

653
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,136
let those heartless gangsters

654
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,003
be caught by the police

655
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,647
so that we the poor will have peaceful days

656
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,876
Goddess you must bless me

657
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,558
Bloody hell

658
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,977
So coincidental

659
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:46,958
Why?

660
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,264
Here to complain to the Goddess'?

661
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,110
NO

662
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,063
I just wished for our
family to be smooth-sailing

663
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,269
Didn't the Goddess tell you

664
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,133
when you were praying just now'?

665
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,106
We, 706, are the lnvincibles,

666
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,212
sent by Goddess Guanyin to protect you

667
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,580
So don't be so unwilling

668
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,728
when I collect protection fees in the future

669
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,468
When I was praying to the Goddess

670
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,595
I told her

671
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,734
if you took our protection fees

672
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,637
and fail to protect us

673
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,591
the Goddess herself

674
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,094
will not let you off

675
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,167
You wretch

676
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,106
Let me say this in front of the Goddess

677
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,020
Listen carefully

678
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,738
This village is my territory

679
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,638
If anyone dares to harass or bully you

680
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,238
you tell me

681
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,567
I will stand up for you

682
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,198
Okay

683
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,506
You better mean what you say

684
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,460
if not

685
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,846
The Goddess will cut your tongue

686
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,872
Cut my tongue?

687
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,220
Because you lied

688
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,355
Wicked girl

689
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,220
The Goddess is here

690
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,036
Don't do that

691
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,068
Be respectful

692
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,569
<i>80"'!</i>

693
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,831
Excuse me

694
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,807
Let's go

695
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,788
You two wretches

696
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,972
Don't let me find you

697
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,910
Father, I'm back

698
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,264
Mother

699
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,435
I'm back

700
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,814
Uncle's back

701
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,166
Good come here

702
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,782
Father I am back

703
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,024
Back from army

704
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,780
Yes

705
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,877
So tanned

706
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,950
It doesn't matter

707
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,327
Being tanned makes you look healthy

708
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:19,974
This is for you

709
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,289
Where is Mother

710
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:21,798
Dear

711
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,710
Ah Hee is back

712
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,591
Mother

713
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,559
Good girl

714
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,431
Uncle

715
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,957
Was the army tough?

716
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,058
Don't mention

717
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,447
The officers are beasts

718
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,213
Made us clean the floor
and toilets in the morning

719
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,969
We had to march and do
training under the hot sun

720
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,623
Also we couldn't sleep well
and there was not enough to eat

721
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,903
Where did you get this fan?

722
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:43,821
Can it be used

723
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,348
Of course the wind is quite strong too

724
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,733
I got it from my friend

725
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,199
His father sells electrical appliances

726
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,723
so I got him to sell at a lower price

727
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,114
for you to use

728
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,054
You will not need to use the hand fan then

729
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,326
You think you earn that much?

730
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,009
No worries

731
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,814
Dear

732
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,354
This is Ah Hee's token of appreciation

733
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,967
You are back

734
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,626
Yes

735
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,664
Where is Sis and Brother'?

736
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,159
Sis is not back yet

737
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,668
Damn it

738
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,738
You live here?

739
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,400
What are you doing here?

740
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:07,901
Don't tell me

741
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,274
Who is Ah Kun to you?

742
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,207
This old geezer

743
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,350
<i>Your father'?</i>

744
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,007
I am Fourth Uncle

745
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,897
Fourth Uncle

746
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,461
Where is Ah Kun?

747
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,333
Get him out now

748
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,083
Ah Kun

749
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,691
someone is looking for you

750
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,875
What is it?

751
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,121
You are back

752
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,141
Who's looking for me?

753
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,121
Yuu are Ah Kun?

754
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,055
Who are you?

755
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,527
You are brilliant

756
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,310
You took potatoes

757
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,230
garlics and onions from people

758
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,350
Before you paid

759
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,199
your provision shop got closed down

760
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,315
And you disappeared

761
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,540
troubling others to look for you

762
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,453
In the end

763
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,376
they had to rely on 706
to collect money from you

764
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,183
Did Ah Dai get you to come?

765
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,879
Not only Ah Dai

766
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,121
There is Stinky, Bull, Birdie

767
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,919
Do you want me to continue?

768
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,489
No, there is no need

769
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,531
Father, Mother it's fine

770
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,519
Bring the kids in

771
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,316
Go in

772
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,606
Let's talk this out

773
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,278
It is nut nice to be seen like this

774
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,471
You know business at the
provision shop is bad

775
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,241
All because of Lee Kuan Yew

776
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,630
who had nothing better to do than
to chase the British Army away

777
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,041
Now all Singapore is left
with soursops and rambutans

778
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,833
No more British troops left

779
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,807
Without the British troops

780
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,296
how will my provision shop survive?

781
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,774
My whole family is going to eat shit

782
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,858
So if you need to collect the debt

783
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,439
get it from Lee Kuan Yew

784
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,431
I don't care for any British
troops or Commando units

785
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,921
Come on

786
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,197
Don't blame it on Lee Kuan Yew

787
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,510
He didn't ask you to gamble

788
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,239
With or without him

789
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,459
your business was doomed for failure

790
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,206
I live nearby

791
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,503
so we're considered fellow villagers

792
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,263
Don't force me to raise my fist against you

793
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,664
Or else, things will get ugly

794
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,847
No, please don't

795
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,645
How much do you have
now? Hand them all over

796
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,006
I don't have a single cent

797
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,893
Big Brother

798
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,913
We are really broke

799
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,502
Don't pretend

800
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,647
I heard

801
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,737
You striked the second prize last week

802
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,013
You striked the second prize? ls it?

803
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,247
NO

804
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,418
Yes I did

805
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,199
I striked but I didn't get the prize money

806
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,214
I placed my bet with Cannon

807
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,395
All would be well if I didn't buy

808
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,154
He disappeared after I won the second prize

809
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,644
He squandered the money. The
whole village's looking for him

810
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,542
I already told him

811
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,504
to not bet with illegal bookies

812
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,669
Nothing would have happened
if he placed the bet legally

813
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,614
Stop telling me where you bought it from

814
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,435
if I don't get the money today

815
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,646
I will ensure that you will see hell soon

816
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,715
Please don't do that, Brother

817
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,581
Haw about this?

818
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,614
My brother-in-law is back from camp today

819
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,109
We are about to have dinner

820
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,982
Mum, why don't we invite
this few brothers to "bed"?

821
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:22,991
What did you say'?

822
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,740
To "bed" - What?

823
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,024
<i>To “bed“</i>

824
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,537
What did I say wrongly?

825
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,812
You better shut up

826
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,029
My wife is Teochew

827
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,686
Her pronunciation of "together"
sounds like "to bed" in Hokkien

828
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,302
She meant we should dine together

829
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,568
Lucky you explained

830
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,534
otherwise we wouldn't
have stood on ceremony

831
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,948
Please don't joke with this

832
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,119
My "bed" is at the back

833
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,383
Come, let's go to "bed"

834
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,318
Big Brother

835
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,748
She said that the bed is at the back

836
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,700
Are we here for debts or are we at the brothel?

837
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,078
It's a misunderstanding

838
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,822
In Teochew pronunciation for
"table" is similar to "bed"

839
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,365
Let's talk while we eat

840
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,599
Big Brother sit

841
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,635
Sit sit

842
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,367
Don't stand on ceremony

843
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,392
Eat eat

844
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,243
What a spread

845
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,279
There is chicken

846
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,247
duck and fish

847
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,401
You still dare say you are brake?

848
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,754
These are domestic poultry

849
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,808
Today is the first time my
brother is back from camp

850
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,655
so Mother prepared a feast

851
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,511
That's all to it

852
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,394
Pig trotters with vinegar

853
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,461
Brother

854
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,400
Your big brother's name is'?

855
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,310
Ah Long

856
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,184
Brother Long

857
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,007
Haw about this?

858
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,987
I still have some potatoes,
ginger, garlic and onions at home

859
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,890
You can take this to cover some debts

860
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,422
I will pay the remaining slowly

861
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,049
You think I am stupid?

862
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,958
You thought that by treating me to a feast

863
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,394
and topping it with two potatoes and garlic

864
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,555
I will have your debt canceled?

865
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,081
They already made it clear

866
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,736
if I don't get the money today

867
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,725
I will chop off your leg

868
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,468
What is it?

869
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,454
Why are you here?

870
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,268
I understand now

871
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,039
Ah Kun is your brother

872
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,303
Yes he is

873
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,527
What's the matter?

874
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,105
As a sister, you should teach your brother

875
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,298
to pay what he owes

876
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,928
My brother owes you money?

877
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,052
How much do you owe them?

878
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,629
Not much

879
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,709
Foreign goods 500 dollars

880
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,559
Gambling debts 150 dollars

881
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,289
A total of 650 dollars

882
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,034
I don't owe him that much

883
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,519
Don't calculate as you wish.
Adding the figure to 650 dollars

884
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,978
Bastard, you dare shout at me?

885
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,253
Just a dinner treat and you think I'm a beggar

886
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,307
I doubt that yuu are broke

887
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,149
Search the whole place now

888
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,999
Please stay calm

889
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,519
I have a pair of golden earrings

890
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,919
you take it as collateral for the debt

891
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,349
Your sister is pretty good

892
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,594
Lucky for you

893
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,063
I am giving you face

894
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,481
as she always pay 706's protection fees timely

895
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,658
Don't say I am headless

896
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,478
I'll give you three days

897
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,784
<i>Three days</i>

898
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,805
if I still don't get the money

899
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,228
I won’t just chop off one leg

900
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,222
I'll leave you with none

901
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,830
Let's go

902
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,773
Sis

903
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,677
Thanks fur helping my husband

904
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,054
Thank what?

905
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,047
She is my sister

906
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,913
It is only natural that she help me

907
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,686
Children, go have your meals

908
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,589
Sis

909
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,627
Do you have any more gold accessories?

910
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,937
Hand all of them out

911
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,155
to pay those gangsters at one-gu

912
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,241
It'll be embarrassing for
us if the neighbors knew

913
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,975
they came to harass us again

914
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,153
If I had any, I won't need to stay here

915
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,662
How about you go help out

916
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,799
at your sister's?

917
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,892
I don't want

918
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,957
These kind of small businesses

919
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,230
doesn't suit me

920
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,698
Sis

921
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,393
Brother is always mean to you,

922
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,568
why did you use your earrings to help him?

923
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,198
Then why did you wake up early
to help me open the store?

924
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,349
Why not sleep in?

925
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,304
There is no why

926
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,765
I missed everyone

927
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,949
when I was in camp

928
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,075
Why did you miss us'?

929
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,815
Because we are family

930
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,893
That's why

931
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,887
You said it yourself

932
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,919
We are family

933
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,321
Place your bets. Place your bets

934
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,311
Sis

935
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,447
What are they doing?

936
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,424
I will go and have a look

937
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,055
They are gambling, what's there to see?

938
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,185
Don't learn gambling, it's illegal

939
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,357
Open open

940
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,964
Brother is gambling over there

941
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,024
Goodness gracious

942
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,860
He just said he had no money to return

943
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,723
and now he is gambling away

944
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,553
This younger brother

945
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,230
Open open

946
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,414
Ah Kun

947
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,264
You still dare to gamble?

948
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,589
Stop gambling

949
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,018
<i>I</i> am just Playing--

950
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,311
What is it to you?

951
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,116
It's none of your business

952
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,799
Scram

953
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,875
Haven't been here in a month

954
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,686
As expected it is the most comfortable here

955
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,768
Army is a waste of time

956
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,683
I think you've become more obedient

957
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,292
Really?

958
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,185
Ah Hee

959
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,167
Uncle

960
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,403
You became bald

961
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,115
ls it good to be in the army'?

962
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,119
It is no good

963
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,258
Really tough

964
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,725
How is your business?

965
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,519
Satisfactory

966
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,112
It's always good

967
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,495
Does camp provide Nasi Lemak?

968
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:39,998
NO

969
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,799
Come over and have some

970
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,325
I really miss this

971
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,641
Auntie

972
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,285
Give him a plate of Nasi Lemak

973
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,399
He loves it

974
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,424
More sambal, please

975
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,932
Sambal is nice, right?

976
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,235
Thanks

977
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,925
Crap

978
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,213
They are here

979
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,252
Aunty

980
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,485
we meet again

981
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,844
We share an affinity

982
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,777
Why so glum?

983
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,692
Can't stomach it?

984
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,646
With regards to yesterday

985
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,503
I gave you credit

986
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,278
since you paid me

987
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,052
Just a blink of an eye

988
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,900
and it's time to collect money again

989
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,304
Look

990
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,210
Only the two of you. How troublesome

991
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,856
Dun'! try to fool me!

992
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,394
Business hasn't been good this month

993
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,367
There is only so much

994
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:28,992
Stop lying

995
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,915
Please, don't hurt us

996
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,474
We don't want any chaos

997
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,163
BOSS

998
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,543
Not enough money

999
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,982
Songkok?

1000
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,319
Tudung?

1001
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,287
There's nothing

1002
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,864
Quick

1003
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,738
NO

1004
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,814
Here?

1005
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,984
NO

1006
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,431
Here?

1007
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,382
Also empty

1008
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,515
Below

1009
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,351
Where?

1010
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,395
Why is it here?

1011
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,414
You asked to put it here yesterday

1012
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,811
Big Brother

1013
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,656
can yuu lower the protection fees for us'?

1014
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,761
We can

1015
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,069
But if someone bullies you

1016
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,515
I will lower your level of protection too

1017
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,487
You ask Zhao Di

1018
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,836
How did I protect her yesterday?

1019
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,222
That wasn't protecting

1020
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,026
You only know how to collect money

1021
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,184
You are just like the British army

1022
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,520
idles that only know haw to collect money

1023
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,225
When the Japs invaded

1024
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,174
all they knew was to run

1025
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,673
The hawker inspectors are here

1026
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,181
Look

1027
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,474
The Japs are here

1028
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,094
You are going to run right'?

1029
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,383
Aren't you the British soldiers?

1030
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,300
I despise gutless people like you

1031
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,448
idles that only collect money

1032
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,671
Remember what you said
in front of the Goddess?

1033
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,681
You promised you will protect us

1034
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,664
If you are a man

1035
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,199
do as you promised

1036
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,986
Big Brother

1037
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,350
You said you will protect us

1038
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,384
Then protect us now

1039
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:11,094
Attack!

1040
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,447
Blood'?

1041
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,167
Police

1042
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,887
You son of a bitch

1043
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,014
You bootlicker

1044
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,639
We are 706. The Invincible

1045
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,483
Catch us if you can

1046
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,373
You assaulted the inspector?

1047
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,492
Let's go

1048
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,309
Why do you two keep
scratching your bottoms?

1049
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,403
Mother

1050
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,113
my buttocks are itchy

1051
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,356
<i>Me too</i>

1052
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,816
Should be the roundworm

1053
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,184
Su Ting

1054
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,961
Get me a tin can

1055
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,024
Place some kerosene inside

1056
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,605
Let me have a look

1057
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,904
That's a huge one

1058
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,957
There are two

1059
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,831
No wonder you can't put on
weight despite eating so much

1060
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,046
So frail and weak

1061
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,576
All full of roundworms

1062
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,340
Shun Fa

1063
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,755
let me have a look

1064
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,949
Yours isn't small either

1065
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,679
Why didn't they take medicine?

1066
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,774
We finished it

1067
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,748
Why didn't you tell me?

1068
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,023
I will have to make a trip
to Thye Shan Medical Hall

1069
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,424
Burn this

1070
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,675
Get a bowl of boiling water

1071
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:06,785
Last mouth

1072
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,841
Let the sick kitty be healthy

1073
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,593
after drinking this

1074
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,875
Your buttocks doesn't itch

1075
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,506
Right

1076
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,534
<i>Tasty</i>

1077
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,959
My buttocks are itching too

1078
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,445
I want to drink it too

1079
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,778
Are your buttocks itchy?

1080
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,564
Or are you itching for a beating?

1081
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,965
Police! Stop running!

1082
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,195
Stop! CID!

1083
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,287
Over there

1084
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,902
Stop! Weren't you guys very arrogant?

1085
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,652
706, Get all your members here if you can!

1086
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,060
Police! Stop now!

1087
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,955
You got the wrong person

1088
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,692
Have you done your homework?

1089
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,344
I don't have my textbook

1090
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,035
Why don't you have it?

1091
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,849
Weren't you using your cousin's textbooks?

1092
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,119
His books can't be used

1093
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,906
The school revised the syllabus

1094
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,738
Revised the syllabus

1095
00:45:59,040 --> 00:45:59,984
How many textbooks can't be used?

1096
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,487
<i>Btu'!</i>

1097
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,812
6 to 7 new textbooks

1098
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,860
Where will I get the money
to get the textbooks?

1099
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,249
Your school is too much

1100
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,214
It has been months since school
started. Why say it only now?

1101
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,486
Actually

1102
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,278
we changed textbooks at the start of the year

1103
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,418
It's just that I kept putting it off

1104
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,462
Teacher said that I can't put it off any longer

1105
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,740
It's all that headless gangsters fault

1106
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,928
The money we earned were snatched away

1107
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,950
If not, we'll have money to
get your textbooks and medicine

1108
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,311
Who?

1109
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,333
Don't scream

1110
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,384
Help me

1111
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,777
The police are out there

1112
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,380
trying to arrest me

1113
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,231
Let me hide here

1114
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,279
Why is 706 afraid of 999?

1115
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,953
It's best if you got caught

1116
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,910
Keep quiet

1117
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,514
I am telling you

1118
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,460
The police are on my heels

1119
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,647
Because of what you said

1120
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,469
I stood up for you

1121
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,437
Stop running!

1122
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,252
You were so arrogant when you
hit the inspectors. Why run now?

1123
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,171
Let me go! I still have a family to feed

1124
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,014
Get them to bed

1125
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,303
Coming

1126
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,054
Police

1127
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,278
Aunty

1128
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,298
My colleague saw the person
we are about to apprehend

1129
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,347
running towards your house

1130
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,863
I wonder if he has slipped into your house?

1131
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:43,638
NO

1132
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,454
NO one came

1133
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,439
No one came right?

1134
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,180
Really?

1135
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,281
Yes

1136
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,521
Can I take a look inside?

1137
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,293
Sure, go ahead

1138
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,438
Get in

1139
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,687
You take a look there

1140
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,055
There

1141
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,630
The kids were doing their homework?

1142
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,414
They are sleeping now

1143
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,413
sleeping

1144
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,134
Let me have a look

1145
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,163
Just some kitchenware

1146
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,607
Over here

1147
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,207
Have a look

1148
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,552
Aunty

1149
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,181
what is inside this?

1150
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,816
I sell soy milk

1151
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,928
This is used to store the soy beans

1152
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,620
Open it

1153
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,626
Open it

1154
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,749
Soy Beans

1155
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,429
Quite fresh

1156
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,792
I'm telling you, this is very expensive

1157
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,564
When I am not around, remember to water it

1158
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,829
if not you will get it from me

1159
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:18,718
Who's that?

1160
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,556
Who's that?

1161
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,641
My younger brother

1162
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,476
Who are you?

1163
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:22,581
He's the police

1164
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,544
here to arrest someone

1165
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,535
I am the police

1166
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,395
Who are you arresting?

1167
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,959
Do you know a gangster called Ah Long?

1168
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,951
Ah Long from 706

1169
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,961
It's best if you arrest him

1170
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,877
Collecting protection fees from everyone

1171
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,086
Making it difficult for us to do business

1172
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,862
Have him arrested and our
village will be in peace

1173
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:38,676
Rest assured

1174
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,409
I'll bring him to the police
station once I see him

1175
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,464
We won't trouble you to
make the extra trip here

1176
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,153
Arrest him under Section 55
and keep him jailed till 55

1177
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,591
Thanks for your Co-operation

1178
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,463
If that's the case, I shall not impose

1179
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,276
Let's go

1180
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,437
Take care

1181
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,641
Close the door

1182
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,422
On the way back

1183
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,705
we saw riot control and
police rounding up gangsters

1184
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,449
That gangster is really brainless

1185
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,197
Assaulting a Government servant

1186
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,713
Are they idiots?

1187
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,319
Don't they know who's their boss? Right'?

1188
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,329
His mother forgot to give him his brain

1189
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,327
when she gave birth to him

1190
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:12,991
Where are the kids?

1191
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,486
They are asleep

1192
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,319
Tidy the desk if they are already asleep

1193
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,100
It's already so late

1194
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,849
Don't waste electricity

1195
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,121
Switch it off and go to sleep

1196
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,104
Go to bed

1197
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,498
Stay here and keep a lookout

1198
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,783
if someone comes along, let me know

1199
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:36,973
Have the police gone?

1200
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,092
They left already

1201
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,618
Don't go that way

1202
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,960
Leave from here

1203
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,342
People's Action Party

1204
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,284
Do come and support us on April 13

1205
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,119
If you give us your vote

1206
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,815
to form the government

1207
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,616
we will get foreign companies into Singapore

1208
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,698
to invest in factories construction

1209
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,597
Everyone would have jobs

1210
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,920
We will also redevelop

1211
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,780
everyone's village

1212
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,359
Build flats

1213
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,304
factories

1214
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,277
wet markets and roads

1215
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,602
No more worries about fire hazards

1216
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,940
or fear for inspectors while doing business

1217
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:26,839
Am ' right?

1218
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,183
Right

1219
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,077
Please support us. The People's Action Party

1220
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:34,091
Cast your votes for us on April 13th

1221
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,401
Why are you here?

1222
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,897
There are many plainclothes
policemen around

1223
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,159
The medication is inside

1224
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:44,661
And textbooks

1225
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,476
Take it

1226
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:53,050
People's Action Party

1227
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,957
Was that Ah Long?

1228
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,137
Hem and haw, must be

1229
00:51:59,320 --> 00:51:59,798
Police

1230
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,660
I saw Ah Long run to the back

1231
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,439
Really? - Yes

1232
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,441
Thank you

1233
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,399
Why did Ah Long come here?

1234
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,401
I have no idea

1235
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,436
Stop! Ah Long from 706

1236
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,358
Tie him up!

1237
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,294
Let go! Let go of me!

1238
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,759
Who did he think he was messing with?

1239
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,979
Now, I don't have to
return the money anymore

1240
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,601
Before the elections,

1241
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,098
many said that they will be able to help us,

1242
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,178
improve our lives

1243
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,646
Now that the elections are over,

1244
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,537
Those that weren't elected

1245
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,086
disappeared

1246
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,307
Those elected, the ones in white,

1247
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,764
will they really be able to improve our lives?

1248
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,605
We are in trouble this time!

1249
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,916
Wondered who were the blind ones

1250
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,536
to elect them as the Government

1251
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,789
So many people unemployed

1252
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,734
Does this Government really know what to do?

1253
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,376
We are in deep shit

1254
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,494
How about we return to Malaysia?

1255
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,544
The Chinese are the majority here

1256
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,241
That's true too

1257
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,111
Coming

1258
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,440
How awe-inspiring!

1259
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,366
People's Action Party

1260
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:25,837
Impressive

1261
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:31,068
People's Action Party

1262
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:35,785
Thank you!

1263
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,667
People's Action Party

1264
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,635
People's Action Party

1265
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,369
Boy, what are you cheering for'?

1266
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,481
Don't know

1267
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,373
People's Action Party

1268
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,713
Not long after, for no rhyme or reason,

1269
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,257
many foreign corporations

1270
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,896
started opening factories here

1271
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,485
Everyone was thus able to get jobs

1272
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,544
They had a stable income,

1273
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,766
and even received CPF

1274
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:56,798
That's right

1275
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,519
CPF is having the Government use our money

1276
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,692
to do compulsory savings for us

1277
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,436
when we are in need of it,

1278
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,005
we aren't able to retrieve it

1279
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,923
It can only be used for buying flats

1280
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,249
Isn't it our money'? Why can't we take it out?

1281
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,227
I'm young and can't comprehend
the reasons behind it

1282
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,999
Perhaps when I'm older, I'll understand

1283
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,959
Mother and Uncle Osman

1284
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,525
grabbed hold of this opportunity

1285
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,393
and applied for a stall in the American factory

1286
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,359
They will be able to avoid the inspectors,

1287
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,566
and the gangsters' harassment

1288
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:26,643
No spoons

1289
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,182
We use our hands

1290
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,361
Delicious

1291
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,390
You pinch it like this

1292
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,123
Mix it

1293
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:33,558
Eat

1294
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,691
<i>Tasty</i>

1295
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,858
Try it

1296
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,877
No thanks

1297
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,256
Heaven is fair

1298
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,391
Little did one expect that the
person-in-charge of the factory

1299
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,239
to be Mr Teo, Mothers regular customer

1300
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,932
We were thus able to get a stall

1301
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,896
Mr Teo really is our benefactor

1302
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,643
The illegal street hawkers

1303
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,025
were chased to start business
at the newly built markets

1304
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,823
As rental was cheap,

1305
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,307
even Uncle Ah Kun who was always
complaining about the Government

1306
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,404
went to apply for a stall to sell vegetables

1307
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,220
Aunty,

1308
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,011
are your hands itching?

1309
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,191
You keep pinching my vegetables

1310
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,031
Are you going to buy them?

1311
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,189
They are not fresh

1312
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,100
They won't be with the way you pinch them

1313
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,318
Hello everybody

1314
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,255
The inspector is here

1315
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:28,824
Morning everyone

1316
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:30,961
Don't be afraid

1317
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:31,763
How do you do?

1318
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,947
I am no longer the inspector

1319
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,468
I work for the People's Association now

1320
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,211
He is the Member of
Parliament (MP) you elected

1321
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,136
He is here to call on everyone

1322
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,309
You are the MP?

1323
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,912
Yes

1324
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,246
You look so different from the photos

1325
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:46,998
ls that so?

1326
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,212
But that doesn't matter

1327
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,590
I just find it unfair that our stall's

1328
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,886
are allocated by balloting

1329
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:52,609
Why do you say that?

1330
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:52,993
Take a look

1331
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,900
Those stalls in front are earning big bucks

1332
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,605
People will just buy from them and leave

1333
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,335
Who will patronise from
stalls at the back? Look

1334
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,327
Not a mosquito in sight

1335
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,222
All the vegetables I purchased are still left over

1336
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,412
It has been a week and they are still unsold

1337
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,965
Even fresh vegetables will become stale

1338
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,076
This gentleman over here,

1339
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,231
balloting for stall spots is just

1340
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,737
With so many people balloting,

1341
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,314
there are bound for some to be in front

1342
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,594
and some at the back

1343
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,989
However you need not worry

1344
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,520
There are many flats

1345
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,823
that are being built around

1346
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,592
Yes. Once people start moving in

1347
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,404
you will have new customers

1348
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,180
I already told him

1349
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,191
but he is full of shit and can't listen properly

1350
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,148
Don't worry. Just bear through this period

1351
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,184
Thank you.

1352
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,627
Shorty. What did you just say'?

1353
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,149
I didn't catch you

1354
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,726
What did you say'?

1355
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,923
I said you were eating abalone, shark's fin

1356
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,495
Harm'?

1357
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:45,791
I will treat you to a slap

1358
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,664
Honestly

1359
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,597
even I can be a MP

1360
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,011
I will contest in the next election

1361
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,104
We shall see who wins'?

1362
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,222
Dear, stop nagging

1363
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,254
Didn't you vote for him?

1364
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,323
Of course not

1365
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,738
On voting day, after I got the voting slip

1366
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,013
I saw a box next to "People's Action Party"

1367
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,030
And I wrote a cross

1368
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,662
A cross means you don't select him

1369
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:07,876
What?

1370
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,967
Are you an idiot?

1371
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,720
By putting a cross, it means you selected him

1372
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,222
That's impossible

1373
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,233
Putting a tick means to select

1374
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,549
Putting a cross means you didn't

1375
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,085
Do you actually know'?

1376
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,516
Shan't argue with you. I'll
let you win this time round

1377
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,212
The radio announced too

1378
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,311
Put a cross next to who yuu want elected

1379
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,868
No one puts ticks

1380
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:25,831
Why didn't you say <i>so</i> earlier?

1381
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,708
I thought you knew

1382
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,126
Get back to work

1383
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,191
Ah Kun

1384
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:31,678
What?

1385
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,563
After we moved

1386
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,863
to this indoor wet market,

1387
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,606
we need nut fear the weather conditions,

1388
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,171
or gangsters that might come
collect protection fees

1389
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,144
Of course we need not fear the inspectors

1390
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,429
Life is not that bad

1391
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,510
Yes

1392
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,830
You are always complaining

1393
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,989
and picking on the Government

1394
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,230
if you have guts,

1395
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,654
don't apply for a stall from the Government

1396
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,212
I have no guts?

1397
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,057
I'll really punch you

1398
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,038
Are you fine with this?

1399
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,454
Having to sell vegetables
when the day is still dark

1400
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,517
Standing all the day long.
Know how much my legs aches?

1401
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,746
I finally understand

1402
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,143
You don't want to stand and earn

1403
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:01,638
So how?

1404
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,580
Why don't you try earning while sitting down?

1405
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:04,598
Sit and earn?

1406
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,478
How?

1407
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,311
Drive unlicensed taxi

1408
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,458
ls it profitable?

1409
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,841
It is

1410
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,938
My friend drives it

1411
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,293
He drives to crowded market
places in the morning,

1412
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:16,049
and the lively red-light district in the night

1413
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,598
Huge crowds of people

1414
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,382
Within a year,

1415
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,910
he bought three unlicensed taxis

1416
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,470
Unlicensed taxis?

1417
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,454
What's this?

1418
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,527
So many gold accessories?

1419
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,574
This is the dowry you gave
me when I got married

1420
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,454
Really

1421
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,289
Keep them well. Don't misplace them

1422
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,716
Had the gangsters found them the other day

1423
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,167
we would have been in deep shit

1424
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,454
I've money to get the unlicensed taxi now?

1425
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,455
Unlicensed taxi?

1426
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,246
This is the last of my fortune

1427
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,033
You aren't allowed to sell them

1428
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,757
I haven't gambled in a long while

1429
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,865
The most I did was buying lottery tickets

1430
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,384
Just think

1431
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,953
if Heaven was going to bless you with riches

1432
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,890
and you didn't place your bet,

1433
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,572
there is nothing Heaven can do too. Right?

1434
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,782
So you still have to place some bets

1435
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,538
Place some bets

1436
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,438
and have hope

1437
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,039
If you really have to bet,

1438
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,326
bet legally

1439
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,102
Small amount of gambling will do

1440
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,298
Even if it's lottery tickets

1441
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:24,869
you need to know your limit

1442
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,172
and not bet excessively

1443
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,574
Honestly

1444
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,533
if you will strike,

1445
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,932
even one lottery ticket
will win you the top prize

1446
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,009
if you have no luck,

1447
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,384
even if you sold me

1448
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,351
to gamble,

1449
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,743
you'll lose everything

1450
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,613
I got it

1451
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,108
Stop nagging

1452
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,068
If you're going to drive the unlicensed taxi,

1453
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,486
and with our vegetable stall doing badly,

1454
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,931
maybe we should just close our business

1455
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,777
Bring it here

1456
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:48,773
Unlicensed taxi

1457
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,399
Buss, give us a better price

1458
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,716
Just this amount'?

1459
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,245
Too little?

1460
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,477
This amount can only buy
an engine, can't buy a car

1461
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,466
If I buy the car, I can't buy an engine

1462
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,723
You lost money? Need to pawn?

1463
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,719
I want to get an unlicensed taxi

1464
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:13,852
But I don't have enough money

1465
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,189
Don't lie to me

1466
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,885
Your sister is selling bean curd
at the American factory

1467
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,035
Business is booming

1468
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,357
That's not making money, she's raking it

1469
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,749
Why don't you get some from her'?

1470
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,204
This factory is so huge,

1471
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,260
no wonder Sister's business is booming

1472
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,629
I got you the application form

1473
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,165
Apply and come work here

1474
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,868
You will have CPF and a
stable income. It's great!

1475
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,191
Why don't you work here too?

1476
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,281
Then you'll have CPF too

1477
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,879
I refuse. This is a woman's job

1478
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:38,824
If I work here

1479
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,456
I will never make it big

1480
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,046
This is quite spacious

1481
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,436
Sis

1482
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:50,277
That free?

1483
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,441
No need to go to the wet market?

1484
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,999
Uncle, Auntie. What would you like to drink?

1485
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,058
Anything would do

1486
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,254
It is impossible to work at the wet market

1487
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,224
The place stinks

1488
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,719
and it's really stuffy

1489
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,869
How much can I earn?

1490
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,765
I've something to discuss with you

1491
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:02,596
Sit and talk

1492
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:03,927
Sit, sit

1493
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,875
What's it?

1494
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,799
The factory is huge, with 800 employees

1495
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:10,767
Business should be flourishing?

1496
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,549
Uncle, Auntie. Your bean curd

1497
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,326
Just a small business. No need
to be afraid of the inspectors

1498
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,589
Also no need to pay protection fees

1499
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,252
That's true

1500
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,159
I was thinking

1501
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,776
if you can be my sponsor and buy me a car

1502
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,184
I want to drive an unlicensed taxi

1503
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,913
We can drive Father and
Mother to town occasionally

1504
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:27,919
The kids can come along with you

1505
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,820
The whole family out on a
trip. Wouldn't it be nice?

1506
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,357
But...

1507
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,794
I know what you're thinking

1508
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,719
I have pawned Ah Feng's gold accessories

1509
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:36,718
Gold accessories?

1510
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,275
Her dowry

1511
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,493
But I'm still short of 500 dollars

1512
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,584
Ah Kun

1513
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,361
Haven't seen you in so long

1514
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,012
What are you chatting about'?

1515
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,159
Just random chit chat

1516
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,252
Chitchat'?

1517
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,175
Tell me

1518
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,725
Maybe I can be of help

1519
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:52,755
Okay, alright

1520
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,538
Can yuu loan me 500 dollars?

1521
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,920
I lack cash

1522
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,546
What?

1523
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:57,681
Lack of cucumbers?

1524
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,441
My wife always does that

1525
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,311
Informing only when we run out of it

1526
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:00,798
Dear

1527
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,395
ls something wrong with your eyes?

1528
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,839
These are rotten

1529
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:07,807
They aren't -They are

1530
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,296
The cucumbers are rotten. There are worms

1531
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,708
Shut up

1532
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,223
I will go to the wet market to get cucumbers

1533
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,178
Once we talk about money, he runs away

1534
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:14,917
Your good friend?

1535
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,417
I don't have that much money

1536
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,439
How can you be broke? You
have 800 employees here

1537
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,538
If everyone drinks a cup
of soybean milk everyday,

1538
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,880
you will earn 40 dollars

1539
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,526
You earn at least a thousand dollars a month

1540
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,676
Not all employees buy from me

1541
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,289
Even if they don't,

1542
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,759
you should have some from
when you sold your daughter

1543
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,662
There should be one or two
thousand dollars. Right'?

1544
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,963
It's not a secret how much
that red packet is worth

1545
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,799
Even if you didn't tell us,

1546
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,677
the whole village knows

1547
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,606
There is a market price

1548
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,795
When you moved back

1549
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,438
you said you will contribute to the family

1550
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:49,718
What about now?

1551
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,560
You might not know this

1552
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,045
Why do you think you still
can stay at our place?

1553
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,653
If not for us putting in good
words in front of Father,

1554
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,598
you would be sleeping on the streets long ago

1555
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,537
Don't forget

1556
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,430
You are my elder sister

1557
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:06,918
Go!

1558
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:10,590
Leave!

1559
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:32,923
Brother

1560
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,014
Did something happen? Why can't we pass?

1561
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,527
There is a little trouble
between the Malays and Chinese

1562
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,439
The races are involved in
physical conflict in the city'?

1563
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,044
Stop talking rubbish. The police will catch you

1564
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,544
Auntie. Get off

1565
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:44,652
The races are in a tense situation in the city

1566
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:45,630
This is only half the journey and

1567
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,559
yuu expect me to alight?

1568
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:47,652
You are too much

1569
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,309
I will only take half the fees from you

1570
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,173
You still want me to pay?

1571
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,399
Half the journey and you want to be paid?

1572
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,140
Forget it. I dun'! want it

1573
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:52,991
Get off. Get off

1574
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,343
How can you do this?

1575
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,988
Run while yuu still can

1576
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,729
How do I get home if I alight now?

1577
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,603
You can walk. Get off

1578
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,983
That's too much

1579
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,839
You're too much

1580
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:04,750
I have no choice

1581
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,029
Quickly find a place and hide

1582
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,834
This is too much

1583
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,837
Did they get into physical
conflicts? Was it out of control?

1584
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,177
No, stop talking nonsense

1585
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,349
Hurry up and go home

1586
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,106
Ah!

1587
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,349
I have to inform Sis, Mother and Ah Feng

1588
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:15,623
There are so many Malays in their factory

1589
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,013
Don't talk rubbish

1590
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:17,559
I know

1591
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:18,334
Remember

1592
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,438
Don't shoot your mouth!

1593
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,106
I know

1594
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,150
That's the Government for you

1595
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,833
Even when things are out of hand,
we're still not allowed to talk

1596
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:23,773
Still trying to cover the truth

1597
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,003
Fatimah made this

1598
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:27,958
It is nice?

1599
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:29,118
It's delicious

1600
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,630
Tonight, I will go over to your place

1601
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,751
And bring more pastries over

1602
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,171
Yuu can taste it. if it's nice,

1603
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,448
Tell me. I want to sell them to the Chinese

1604
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,112
ls that possible?

1605
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,486
No problem

1606
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,543
Fourth Aunt. Fatimah made these

1607
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:41,470
Sis. Sis

1608
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,254
It's so scary

1609
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,953
The races are in a conflict again

1610
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,349
Where is Mather'?

1611
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,079
Here

1612
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:46,967
There is conflict between the races

1613
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:47,879
Are you serious?

1614
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:48,585
Yes

1615
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,567
What did you say'?

1616
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:50,881
What nonsense are you spouting?

1617
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,820
Physical conflict?

1618
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:53,898
Where did yuu get that from'?

1619
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,394
Stop spouting nonsense

1620
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,532
I am not

1621
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,709
I was driving my taxi earlier on

1622
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,758
When I was in town, I met
Ah Hee doing guard duty

1623
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,235
He says the races have
engaged in physical conflict

1624
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,311
It's chaotic out there

1625
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:05,993
That is scary

1626
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,397
Sir, Stop spreading rumors

1627
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,782
I am telling the truth

1628
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,700
I saw it with my own eyes

1629
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:13,694
Ah Kun

1630
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:15,998
Quick run for our lives

1631
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,458
Quickly flee!

1632
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,390
Run for your life!

1633
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,460
That's enough. Stop squabbling

1634
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,276
We will leave with you

1635
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:23,230
You leave with Fourth Aunt

1636
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,743
Ah Feng. Let's go

1637
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,364
Find Shun Fa. I'll wait outside for you

1638
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:32,716
Shun Fa

1639
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,007
Shun Fa

1640
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:37,974
Shun Fa

1641
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:40,015
Shun Fa

1642
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:00,963
Stop the car!

1643
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,159
Su Ting hasn't got on

1644
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,070
She is at the back

1645
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,049
Su Ting

1646
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,572
Quickly hop on

1647
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,483
Shun Fa is already in the car

1648
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,544
Hurry "P!

1649
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,473
In that era, for some unknown reasons,

1650
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,467
boys were precious while girls were nut

1651
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,387
But strangely, as a female,

1652
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:23,206
one never found any wrong
with it and accepted it

1653
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:42,158
Learning from the 1964's racial riot,

1654
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,208
the Government was worried
that rumors would spread

1655
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,340
and worsen the situation

1656
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,088
Hence, they sent staff
from Community Centers

1657
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,467
to villages to explain the situation

1658
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,023
appealing for the crowd to keep calm

1659
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:58,781
Ai yo, what happened? How did
things turn out like this?

1660
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,430
How would I know why it happened?

1661
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,437
Everyone is doing this now

1662
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,971
I also informed our neighbors

1663
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,900
to sharpen the bamboo poles

1664
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,069
Whoever dare come, we'll
take them on with our lives

1665
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,597
Our village seems peaceful,

1666
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:12,181
do we have really have to do this?

1667
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,746
It will be too late to start when it happens

1668
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,564
Stop talking and start sharpening

1669
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,491
Hello?

1670
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,545
Uncle, Brother, Have you eaten?

1671
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:28,857
What is it?

1672
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:33,292
I am from the People's Association

1673
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,785
I'm here to inform everyone

1674
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,451
that the small misunderstanding
between the races

1675
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,671
is under the Government's control

1676
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:42,773
Completely under control?

1677
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,422
Yes

1678
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,749
Please don't believe the rumors

1679
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,439
Don't listen to rumors

1680
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,591
Okay?

1681
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:50,493
Thanks

1682
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,007
Goodbye

1683
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:55,360
That civil servant is too funny

1684
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,660
Lying through his teeth

1685
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:58,807
Under control?

1686
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,173
Ah Hee told me there's
conflict between the races

1687
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,910
It's a huge mess cut there

1688
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:04,984
Can that be controlled so easily?

1689
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:06,646
Remember what happened in 1964?

1690
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:07,591
There were chaos everywhere

1691
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,329
Burning of cars, houses and shops

1692
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,623
All that could burn were burnt

1693
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:11,590
How can it be that easy to control?

1694
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,077
Listen

1695
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,334
If the Government sent
someone to give the notice,

1696
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,919
then I believe the incident this time round

1697
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,764
isn't as serious as it was in 1964

1698
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,024
I think SO £00

1699
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:22,733
What do you know'?

1700
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,121
What are we supposed to do now?

1701
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:25,232
What should we do?

1702
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,494
Get out the knives,
parangs and bamboo poles

1703
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,100
Grind and sharpen them

1704
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,359
Whoever dares come,

1705
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:29,838
I'll take them on with my life

1706
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,268
What else?

1707
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,230
Dear, some people are saying

1708
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,878
there's tension between the races now

1709
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,008
You still want to bring these
pastries to the Chinese kampung'?

1710
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,724
My heart won't be at ease if I don't send these

1711
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,405
We've promised them, didn't we'?

1712
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,149
What's the most important value?

1713
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:48,127
Promise

1714
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,108
Nothing will happen

1715
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:51,638
<i>Come</i>

1716
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,919
You just tag along, Timah

1717
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,725
It will be fine

1718
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,144
You don't have to worry... Hurry up!

1719
01:09:58,920 --> 01:09:59,773
Inspectors! Inspectors!

1720
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,177
Hide the pastries! Hide the pastries!

1721
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:02,118
Sorry, Sir!

1722
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,519
I'm giving these pastries to my friends

1723
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,038
Please listen first

1724
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:07,658
I'm no longer an inspector

1725
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,704
Listen first

1726
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,516
I'm no longer an inspector now

1727
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,567
Where are you working now?

1728
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,944
I am working at the Residents' Committee

1729
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,333
He's a civil servant now

1730
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,019
I came over to inform you

1731
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,907
that the small misunderstanding
between the Malays and Chinese

1732
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,605
is under the Government's control

1733
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:26,960
That's great

1734
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,576
We, Malays will feel at ease too

1735
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:30,584
Have the Chinese been informed'?

1736
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,630
Of course

1737
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,483
I'm going door-to-door to do that

1738
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:36,385
Regardless of race

1739
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,095
all must help one another

1740
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,064
and work together

1741
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,366
That is racial harmony

1742
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,340
Othenuise we cannot survive

1743
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:43,380
Are you sure the Chinese knew about this?

1744
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,310
Yes

1745
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:48,119
He said it's fine so everything must be good

1746
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,555
Come, let's deliver the pastries

1747
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,405
These pastries look delicious

1748
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,193
You confiscated quite an amount
as an inspector. Didn't you try?

1749
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,646
I've got to go

1750
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,269
Mr Shamugam, have a taste

1751
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,344
I made these

1752
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,237
Mr Shamugam, it's my treat

1753
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,145
Ridiculous

1754
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,267
We are close to the Malays in the next village

1755
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,822
Why would they do this to us'?

1756
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,026
Only you think you're close to them

1757
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,959
Do yuu even know what they think of you?

1758
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,462
Let me tell you all

1759
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:18,629
There's tension between the races now

1760
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,279
We have to protect ourselves

1761
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,555
When they come for us

1762
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:22,641
we will use this bamboo

1763
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:23,738
the sharp end here

1764
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,034
to fight them

1765
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,030
If they come from this direction

1766
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:27,098
we will stab from here

1767
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,213
If they come from this direction

1768
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,127
stab from here

1769
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:29,974
If they come from this direction

1770
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:30,853
we will stab from here

1771
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:31,933
If they come from this direction

1772
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:32,756
We will stab...

1773
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,319
Pastries?

1774
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:34,594
Friend

1775
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,099
The Malays are here!

1776
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:42,869
We... pastries...

1777
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:43,759
Eat... Friend...

1778
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:44,670
Eat friend?

1779
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,100
It's Osman and Fatimah

1780
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,178
Osman is Malay

1781
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,134
He was waving a knife at me earlier on

1782
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,946
Don't panic

1783
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,223
It was a misunderstanding

1784
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,254
Osman is my longtime friend

1785
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,157
He's just here to send pastries

1786
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,502
This is serious

1787
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:03,487
NO

1788
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,719
I have to go explain

1789
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,326
Isn't it dangerous if you head over now?

1790
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,374
They won't hurt me

1791
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,357
Look at your sister

1792
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,038
Return to your rooms now

1793
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,316
Dear, go have a look

1794
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:19,404
Zhao Di, wait. Don't go

1795
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:20,984
Fourth Uncle, you need not follow me

1796
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,991
I need to explain to Osman

1797
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,933
You are sure they won't do anything to you?

1798
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,970
They've been our neighbors for so long

1799
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,877
Once I explain, everything will be alright

1800
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,740
You can go back. I'll be back soon

1801
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:32,839
It will be safer if I'm with you

1802
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,137
Okay. Let's go then

1803
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,663
What are you hiding behind?

1804
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:36,655
Nothing

1805
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:37,672
Let me have a look

1806
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,102
Why are you hiding a kitchen knife?

1807
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,339
How can we go over without this?

1808
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,723
If they saw you holding this,

1809
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,273
something will boil out from nothing

1810
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,805
You can't take this

1811
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,569
Mother

1812
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,658
Why did you come along?

1813
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:53,883
I was thinking

1814
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,479
if you brought a child with you

1815
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:56,823
it won't look like you are asking for a fight

1816
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,079
Sounds reasonable

1817
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,357
Clever wretch

1818
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,005
Okay. Let's go

1819
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,458
Don't hold the kitchen knife

1820
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:07,412
Walk. Watch your step

1821
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,350
Be careful

1822
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,825
We need to protect our village

1823
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,626
Right

1824
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,726
Osman is back

1825
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:19,317
What's the matter?

1826
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:20,838
Nothing

1827
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,207
Nothing?

1828
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:26,107
Nothing's the matter -What
do you mean there's nothing?

1829
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,144
They were very hostile

1830
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:29,094
Don't worry. Nothing is going on

1831
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:32,909
It's a problem for me if there's discord

1832
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,240
HOW $0?

1833
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:37,460
I still need to pass through the
Chinese village to chop coconuts

1834
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:39,709
Did you hear that?

1835
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,514
They are going to chop our heads

1836
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,475
No, chop coconuts

1837
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,102
Not human heads

1838
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,412
Human head

1839
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,260
Coconut

1840
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,469
Human head

1841
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:52,390
Coconut

1842
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,253
Grandfather

1843
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,180
I heard coconut

1844
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,247
Coconut?

1845
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:57,727
Coconut

1846
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,856
if you misheard,

1847
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:00,824
once we step out from here

1848
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,945
our heads will roll like coconuts

1849
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,542
It won't

1850
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,346
Let's go out together

1851
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,164
We can still make it if we leave now

1852
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:23,559
Don't fear

1853
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,050
Osman is my good friend.

1854
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,859
We wan'! be able to leave now

1855
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,631
Look. There's only three of them

1856
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,984
There is a young girl and an elder

1857
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,994
There are <i>so</i> many of us
and only three of them

1858
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,001
There's no problem

1859
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,189
Nobody at the back?

1860
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,719
NO

1861
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,654
Just the three of us

1862
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:51,795
Listen to me

1863
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,834
No need to explain

1864
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:00,107
I saw Ah Kun and your family
all ready with their weapons

1865
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:03,238
I have advised him to not behave like this

1866
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,829
You know how wicked his mouth is

1867
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,183
We have been friends for so long

1868
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,895
The affairs of others are none of our concern

1869
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,240
We are friends

1870
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,969
No conflicts

1871
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,497
We are all friends

1872
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,055
No fights

1873
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:15,867
We are all neighbors

1874
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,001
Are you serious?

1875
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,883
Yes, I'm serious

1876
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,692
I am sure he's serious

1877
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:23,298
If they didn't treat us as friends

1878
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,079
if they don't trust us,

1879
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:28,039
They won't dare come to us

1880
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,980
under such a situation

1881
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,185
It's just like how you trust us

1882
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:35,807
that's why you bought the pastries over

1883
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,928
I have many Malay friends too

1884
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:40,424
Look

1885
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,260
Even the kids say so

1886
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:48,189
We must let everyone know that

1887
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,919
Chinese and Malays are good friends

1888
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,252
We will set up our stalls as usual tomorrow

1889
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,988
Let everyone know we are still good friends

1890
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:56,944
Deal

1891
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:57,934
Deal

1892
01:15:58,680 --> 01:15:59,704
In that case

1893
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,563
I can continue going to the Chinese village

1894
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:02,812
to cut human heads

1895
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,894
This time I heard it loud and clear

1896
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,695
Slip of a tongue

1897
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:07,812
Coconut

1898
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,404
He likes to joke

1899
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:18,147
Lucky they are good neighbors that are

1900
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,332
willing to listen what we have to say

1901
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,838
Othenuise there would be chaos

1902
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:24,118
Mother

1903
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:25,014
look

1904
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:26,709
What's it?

1905
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:28,995
What happened?

1906
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:32,750
Why are there police cars?

1907
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:34,572
Why are there police cars?

1908
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:35,443
Move

1909
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,463
Don't hit me

1910
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,003
Why are you hitting my brother?

1911
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,041
Someone reported

1912
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,923
that your son was spreading rumors

1913
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,239
of conflicts between the races

1914
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:47,127
chaos on the streets

1915
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,833
and trouble everywhere

1916
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:51,548
It caused tension between the races

1917
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,319
Gave us so much extra work

1918
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:53,798
Move

1919
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:55,613
It's a misunderstanding

1920
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:00,505
He didn't mean it

1921
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,325
This fatty Osman framed me

1922
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:07,149
Don't catch me

1923
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,479
That was how Uncle got caught

1924
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:17,333
That year

1925
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,773
the Government arrested thousands
of potential troublemakers,

1926
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,159
gangsters and rebels

1927
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:26,949
That was how the chaos was
brought to an end so quickly

1928
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,359
It's also the main reason why

1929
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:31,694
the riots in 1969 was less serious than in 1964

1930
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,706
Ah Kun was arrested

1931
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:37,751
Last night?

1932
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,014
I'm worried that Ah Kun will be
beaten up when he's in prison

1933
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,703
Stop guessing

1934
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:43,506
He will definitely be beaten

1935
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:44,838
<i>Why so?</i>

1936
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:47,612
It's just like Nasi Lemak

1937
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:48,518
Look

1938
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,022
Rice. Chili sauce

1939
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,326
Chili sauce. Cucumber

1940
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,085
Arrested. Police

1941
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:54,349
Police. Get beaten

1942
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,899
Do you know anyone that can help?

1943
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:00,641
Let me think

1944
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,521
Let's start business

1945
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,518
The Nasi Lemak and soyabean milk package

1946
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,544
is very cheap

1947
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,557
Ten cents for

1948
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,527
Nasi Lemak and soyabean milk

1949
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,564
It's only ten cents

1950
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,260
In this sensitive time,

1951
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,943
Mother and Uncle Osman

1952
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:23,894
To reduce the tension between races

1953
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,782
collaborated and came out with a Nasi Lemak

1954
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:27,744
and soyabean milk package

1955
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,637
It represented that togetherness of everyone

1956
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,439
and showed off the kampung spirit

1957
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:32,726
This initiative got

1958
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,492
them praise from the MP

1959
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:48,138
If you tell MP Lim

1960
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,731
about the situation, he might be able to help

1961
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:52,989
Mr Shamugan

1962
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:53,683
How are you?

1963
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:54,778
I'm fine

1964
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:56,327
MP Lim

1965
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:57,359
Thank you

1966
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,680
This is Zhao Di

1967
01:18:58,720 --> 01:18:59,755
She has a request

1968
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,629
Hi MP

1969
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:04,826
I have a favour

1970
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:05,955
What is it?

1971
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:08,065
My brother got arrested recently

1972
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:09,986
He didn't mean it

1973
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,548
He has always been like this

1974
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,142
He has a wicked mouth but he means no harm

1975
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,966
He won't say things to
disrupt the society's peace

1976
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,638
I can be the witness

1977
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,252
I've known him as my neighbor for years

1978
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,760
I know him. He is not a bad person

1979
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,487
<i>I</i> $86

1980
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,387
Do you know anybody from Home Affairs?

1981
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,826
I know some people there

1982
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:30,214
Let me check

1983
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,878
But no guarantee

1984
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,016
I'll help you ask

1985
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,041
Don't worry

1986
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:36,778
Thank you so much

1987
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:37,858
Thank you so much

1988
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:52,934
Please take a seat

1989
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,075
Thanks

1990
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,757
I have talked to the officer

1991
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,625
He will ask a few questions later

1992
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:10,755
Just answer them

1993
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,201
Can I trouble you

1994
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,231
to hand this to the officer'?

1995
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:16,446
This won't do

1996
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,991
Lee Kuan Yew hates corruption

1997
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,231
Ah Kun won't be the only one in trouble

1998
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:22,611
you will be in trouble too

1999
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:24,607
Haw about this?

2000
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,996
You can give this to the officer's father

2001
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:29,637
Are you mad?

2002
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,791
Ah Kun won't be the only one in trouble

2003
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:32,767
you will be in trouble

2004
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:33,693
SO will I

2005
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,245
Everyone will be in trouble

2006
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,464
So stop playing tricks

2007
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:37,578
No thanks

2008
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:38,624
Please keep it

2009
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,142
ls your superior getting ready to meet them?

2010
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,423
No, they'll need to wait for a while

2011
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,399
He is busy at the moment

2012
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,868
It'll be your turn soon

2013
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,917
She says we still need to wait

2014
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,624
It's late

2015
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:48,527
I have to go

2016
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,540
Just tell the officer nicely

2017
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,039
He will help you

2018
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:53,798
Good luck

2019
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:54,596
Thank you

2020
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:55,266
Goodbye

2021
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,262
<i>80"'!</i>

2022
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:59,338
The bus I was on has a punctured tyre

2023
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,100
What's the situation like?

2024
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,087
He wants us to wait

2025
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:02,213
Hold on a moment

2026
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:05,398
Hi

2027
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:06,180
Hi

2028
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:09,264
Your sister can't speak English

2029
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:10,247
You shall be the translator later

2030
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:10,997
Understood

2031
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,525
You can go in now

2032
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,584
Let's go

2033
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,749
Hold on

2034
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,848
No need so many people. Just one will do

2035
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,612
What did she say'?

2036
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,502
Let me do it

2037
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,493
Can I go in also?

2038
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,079
Because I am her brother

2039
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,286
I need to translate for her

2040
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:25,384
She can't speak English

2041
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:25,969
Don't worry

2042
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,172
He understands Hokkien

2043
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:28,921
That's good

2044
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,041
No need to worry

2045
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,237
It's best that he understands Hokkien

2046
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:33,984
That's great

2047
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:34,879
Thank you

2048
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,109
Yuu are so kind and beautiful

2049
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:37,967
Ah Soh?

2050
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:39,089
NO

2051
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:42,340
Yuu are so kind and beautiful

2052
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:43,511
Thank you

2053
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,291
You may go in

2054
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:47,591
I'll go in then

2055
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,139
(One Month Later)

2056
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,064
Taxi?

2057
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:00,835
Should be Ah Kun

2058
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,506
Ah Kun is back

2059
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:07,589
Father

2060
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:11,218
You are back

2061
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:12,446
Good

2062
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,464
Where is my unlicensed taxi?

2063
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,098
Sold

2064
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:16,973
Sold'?

2065
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,929
Why didn't you ask me before you sell it'?

2066
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:19,951
You were in jail

2067
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:20,999
How could I ask?

2068
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,048
You could wait till I was out.
Can't you wait eight months?

2069
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:23,990
Will you die if you waited?

2070
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:25,940
You sold my car with my permission

2071
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,678
What will I survive on in future?

2072
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:28,778
Eat shit is it'?

2073
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,593
Wait

2074
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,228
You need to step over the stove

2075
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,560
Change your luck

2076
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,062
I can change my luck by stepping over this?

2077
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:37,535
Stepped over

2078
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,447
Has my luck changed?

2079
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,045
Will my car return?

2080
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:40,854
Dear

2081
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,143
You were locked up for eight months

2082
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:43,218
if we didn't sell the car

2083
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,213
what will the kids

2084
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:45,969
and your parents eat?

2085
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:47,252
Me being a woman

2086
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:48,624
What do you want me to do'?

2087
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:49,158
What about Sis?

2088
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,567
She didn't help?

2089
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,796
If she didn't, would you be here?

2090
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,280
Just for you,

2091
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,492
we went everywhere we could to plead

2092
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,306
for your release

2093
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,608
How can you say something
so heartless now?

2094
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:00,675
Heartless?

2095
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:02,457
Who is the heartless one?

2096
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:03,276
I was caught because

2097
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,351
she and Osman framed me

2098
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:06,458
Think I was in the dark?

2099
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,199
Don't talk rubbish

2100
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,020
Don't accuse Osman and me

2101
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:11,735
Accuse? You think I've nothing better to do'?

2102
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:12,591
Dear

2103
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,113
Others were locked up for 6 to 10 years

2104
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,919
You were only locked up for eight months

2105
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,763
Haven't wondered why that's so?

2106
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,905
Because I was obedient and likeable

2107
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:22,311
They said I resembled the skinny
comedian from the comedic duo

2108
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,344
If I were to rely on you people

2109
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,204
the police would have killed me like a dog

2110
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,117
I feel like killing you now

2111
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:28,982
Enough

2112
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,725
All these were blessed by
the Goddess and deities

2113
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,216
After all that time in prison,

2114
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,594
you look malnourished

2115
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:35,999
Here, essence of chicken for you

2116
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,479
I'll drink it after my shower

2117
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,479
I'm telling you

2118
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,585
Drink one bottle everyday

2119
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,863
It's good for your health

2120
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:44,315
Do you think I am a flower
that needs watering everyday?

2121
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,102
I'll drink it after my shower

2122
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:49,988
Remember to use the flower water to bathe

2123
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:52,185
Have your dinner after your bath

2124
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,972
Let's eat

2125
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:58,639
Go away

2126
01:23:58,640 --> 01:23:59,698
Don't sit here

2127
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:00,812
I don't want

2128
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:01,978
Don't sit here

2129
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,959
Just sit. What's there to fight over?

2130
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:04,984
There are so many chairs

2131
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,428
Why fight over that seat'?

2132
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:07,236
Ah Hai, came aver

2133
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,532
Let's eat

2134
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,211
Eat while it's still hot

2135
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:11,493
Eat

2136
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:13,988
There are so many seats

2137
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,115
Why must yuu sit here?

2138
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,045
You sit. I will move

2139
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:17,967
Ah Hai, sit here

2140
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,717
Lower the volume

2141
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,029
Shun Fa is sleeping

2142
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,524
Haven't you cooled dawn after a shower'?

2143
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:27,926
I was in jail for eight months

2144
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,917
Will the grievance just
vanish because of a shower'?

2145
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:33,530
We are eating soon. Why
are yuu eating biscuits?

2146
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:35,437
Just a biscuit and you have to nag

2147
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,226
When you sold my car, did you ask me'?

2148
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:39,391
Do I need to send an
application to eat a biscuit?

2149
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,471
You know that coffee and
biscuits are my everything

2150
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,079
I'll die if I'm not allowed to eat them

2151
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,809
Okay, I was in the wrong

2152
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:45,746
Father

2153
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,980
Letter from the Agri-food and
Veterinary Authority (AVA)

2154
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,638
They want you to pay the farming permit fees

2155
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:50,575
15 dollars

2156
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:51,635
Look

2157
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:53,635
Rise in prices again

2158
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,382
We are not even raising pigs

2159
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,717
The fees rises every year

2160
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:59,319
We are not farming anymore

2161
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:01,391
How about we stop
paying? Don't waste money

2162
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:02,578
Not worth it

2163
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,497
What do you women know?

2164
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:07,367
Haw about this?

2165
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,092
Ah Kun, you just got released

2166
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:11,168
I will give you my farming license

2167
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,879
Anyway you have no job at the moment

2168
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,405
You can earn money by raising pigs

2169
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,506
Heard the thunder roaring?

2170
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:19,710
Ask me to raise pigs?

2171
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,336
Even Heaven is against it

2172
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,420
Do you know how dirty it's to raise pigs?

2173
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,039
You have to bathe them
and wipe their buttocks

2174
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,417
I will not earn this kind of money

2175
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,524
I'm worried that with a mark
on your identification card

2176
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:32,879
it'll be difficult for you to get a job

2177
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:33,972
It's fine if you don't want to do it

2178
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,759
Doesn't pay to be kind

2179
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,717
I was treated like a pig the
eight months I was in jail

2180
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,415
You still want me to take care of them?

2181
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:41,460
Since you don't want to do it, Ah Hee, you do it

2182
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,629
Me? Rear the pigs?

2183
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:44,414
I don't want to

2184
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:47,404
After army, I'm going to be a bus conductor

2185
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:50,307
I will get paid, get CPF and free transportation

2186
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,407
Fourth Uncle

2187
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,343
Since they don't want it, can I have it?

2188
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:58,119
There is a change of bosses in the
factory. My permit will end this month

2189
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:00,782
If I have the farming permit, I
can rear chickens, pigs and ducks

2190
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,371
My kids can help with odd jobs at
home too. To help with the expenses

2191
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:04,687
You really don't want to do it?

2192
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,767
Like hell

2193
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,740
At least recommend a better job

2194
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:08,426
If there is none

2195
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:09,441
don't bother me

2196
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:13,039
The son of the dry-cleaning shop

2197
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,189
just bought a Yellow Top Taxi and

2198
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,315
is looking for a driver to do the morning shift

2199
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:16,439
How about that?

2200
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:17,350
This is better

2201
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,129
I used to drive the unlicensed taxi

2202
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:20,151
Get me to rear pigs?

2203
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,685
Why not ask the pigs to raise me

2204
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:22,799
I have raised you till what you are now

2205
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:23,767
Am <i>I</i> the pig?

2206
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,740
It's fine if he doesn't want to do it,

2207
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:28,489
Who still rear pigs these days?

2208
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:30,682
Besides you don't know when the
Government is going to resettle us

2209
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:33,605
If we invest all our money
and start rearing pigs,

2210
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,085
and then the Government evicts us,

2211
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,292
won't all our money go down the drain?

2212
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:37,237
I am full

2213
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:37,980
You guys eat

2214
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,286
I'll be out drinking with my friends

2215
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,467
It's raining. You still want to go out'?

2216
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,733
What's there to fear about rain'? It's not a flood

2217
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,909
You think I'll drown?

2218
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,542
I'm not eating

2219
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,618
I'll be going back to camp

2220
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:53,652
Both of them are like this

2221
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,287
You take over then

2222
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,574
This is absurd. Why are there so many leaks?

2223
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:17,544
I've a pot here

2224
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:18,675
What day is it today?

2225
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:19,516
The third

2226
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:22,507
No wonder. The third and eighteenth
brings about water calamities

2227
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:24,420
Will there be a flood then?

2228
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:25,965
Over there

2229
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:27,478
Gosh

2230
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,289
Looks like the rain isn't going to stop

2231
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,027
Quick, catch the leaks

2232
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:26,130
Put the items that can't be
dampened on higher grounds

2233
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:03,333
Pack the children's birth
certificates and identification cards

2234
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,831
Stop playing with the water. It's dirty

2235
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,740
if dead cockroaches, rats

2236
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:14,921
or snakes turn up, then you'll regret it

2237
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:15,813
Get up

2238
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,982
Take care of your brother. Stop fooling around

2239
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,789
This is terrible. The
electricity got cut off suddenly

2240
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,633
Did the Government cut our power supply?

2241
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:26,509
There is a kerosene lamp
here. Get the kids in here

2242
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,507
Stop running. It's dangerous

2243
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:29,988
Be careful

2244
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,252
Hope the rain stops soon

2245
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:32,852
The water is coming in

2246
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:34,919
Ah Kun should be back soon

2247
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:35,603
Yes

2248
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:39,593
We are smart to have invented stilt houses

2249
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:42,507
Even if it floods, we have nothing to fear

2250
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:44,578
Be careful. This is terrible

2251
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:46,762
Didn't think the water will come in so quickly

2252
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:49,550
Birth certificates and
identification cards with you'?

2253
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:51,404
Yes

2254
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:54,025
The rain is pouring and the water level is rising

2255
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:55,822
Haw is Dear going to come back?

2256
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:59,124
It's pitch-dark outside

2257
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,999
What is he doing?

2258
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,538
Can't even stay to help out at home

2259
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:20,849
I think the rain isn't going to stop

2260
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,820
Just a moment and the water
level is up to the chest

2261
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:24,706
We have to go

2262
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:27,530
If we don't, we'll drown
and become water spirits

2263
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,740
Why aren't there any people rescuing us?

2264
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:31,679
It's pitch black outside

2265
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:32,795
What to do?

2266
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,329
My husband is useless

2267
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,511
He's never around when we need him

2268
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:40,980
Should we drown

2269
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,123
I won't let him rest in peace

2270
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,399
That brat is useless

2271
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,754
Shouldn't have rescued him

2272
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:48,036
Stop complaining. Stop quarreling

2273
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,940
I'll go see which route to take

2274
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,598
Then I'll come back for you all

2275
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,564
Be careful!

2276
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:55,278
Sis, take care

2277
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,516
Mother, be careful

2278
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,359
Dear, you said you were
a smart inventor right?

2279
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,998
Look! What do we do now?

2280
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:13,873
Don't cry. Dad promise all of you. Next time,

2281
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:17,589
I will build a much taller house
so that everyone will be safe

2282
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:20,224
Why is it taking so long?

2283
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:21,840
Why are there no rescuers?

2284
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:24,078
Even I'm a little scared

2285
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,045
Father

2286
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:29,876
Look

2287
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:32,321
Over here

2288
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:37,901
Help! Help us here!

2289
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:38,774
Ahmad

2290
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,518
Bring the raft closer

2291
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,928
We'll rescue you

2292
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:49,965
All on the boat

2293
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,900
UP

2294
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,820
Hurry

2295
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:55,012
Don't be afraid

2296
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:58,970
They will send you to a safe area

2297
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,662
Up the boat

2298
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:05,431
Anyone else?

2299
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:07,863
Have you been to Zhao Di's?

2300
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:09,260
Not yet

2301
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:10,380
What?

2302
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:25,040
Oh my god

2303
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,398
It's pitch-dark

2304
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:29,994
The rain's getting heavier

2305
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:32,393
All the paths and roads are all submerged

2306
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:34,636
How are we going to get out?

2307
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,089
Goddess Guanyin, you must bless me

2308
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,279
Someone's there?

2309
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,214
Is that you?

2310
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,156
Who?

2311
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:46,110
Sis

2312
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:47,727
Sis

2313
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,508
Our house is submerged too

2314
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:51,647
Yes

2315
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:53,990
Hurry and go home. Everyone's worried

2316
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,728
Why didn't you tell me our house was flooded?

2317
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,338
There was no time

2318
01:32:58,480 --> 01:32:59,572
Be careful

2319
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,577
Why did you come from there?

2320
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,218
I don't know

2321
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:06,109
I just walked and turn up here

2322
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:07,989
You don't need to be afraid

2323
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:10,671
We have used this route for years

2324
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:12,006
Even with our eyes closed...

2325
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:13,734
Ah Kun

2326
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:14,796
Ah Kun

2327
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:17,950
Ah Kun

2328
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:28,925
Ah Kun

2329
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,762
Is anyone else cut there?

2330
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:40,631
No one

2331
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,297
Ah Kun

2332
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:50,264
Snake

2333
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:51,999
Help

2334
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:52,854
Osman

2335
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:53,853
Osman

2336
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:56,082
Help

2337
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:57,078
Zhao Di

2338
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:57,951
Help Ah Kun

2339
01:33:58,120 --> 01:33:58,780
Snake

2340
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,092
Osman

2341
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:02,574
Ah Kun

2342
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,700
Young man

2343
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:29,573
Young man, help!

2344
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,439
Young man

2345
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:34,501
Young man, help!

2346
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,494
Ah Kun, where are you'?

2347
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:41,351
Ah Kun

2348
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:42,438
Are you alright?

2349
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:43,794
Where's Osman?

2350
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:31,311
You okay

2351
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,253
Thanks

2352
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:33,710
Thanks for saving me

2353
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:35,693
You're welcome

2354
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:38,889
Thank you

2355
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:40,599
Here

2356
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:41,396
Up the boat

2357
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:42,391
Up the boat

2358
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:42,901
Wait

2359
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:44,445
There are still some people at home

2360
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,494
Fourth Uncle. Fourth Aunt

2361
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:49,035
Su Ting, get everybody out

2362
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,989
Get the children out

2363
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:01,014
The 1969 Floods

2364
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:02,736
seized the lives of some

2365
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:05,548
Many were homeless

2366
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:07,882
and the state of destruction was serious

2367
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:11,220
After the Government's inquiry

2368
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:13,374
to prevent floods from recurring

2369
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:16,359
they got a professional
construction company (Koh Brothers)

2370
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:19,404
to dig drains and improve the drainage system

2371
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,183
to prevent history from repeating itself

2372
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:33,488
Uncle Osman's brave actions

2373
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:36,206
were once again applauded
by the Government

2374
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:39,018
We were very thankful

2375
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,216
The flood was in the past

2376
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:49,170
Water levels have subsided

2377
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:53,330
Our house wasn't washed away

2378
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,844
But will the flood occur again?

2379
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:00,058
This, we do not know

2380
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:02,051
The Government said that

2381
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:06,080
The most ideal solution is to move to the flats

2382
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:10,018
There will be less chances of fire
hazards and flooding problems

2383
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:13,987
To move away from a place
we stayed for so many years

2384
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:16,888
Who will be willing?

2385
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:20,792
But for the country to develop and improve

2386
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:22,555
Reluctant or not

2387
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:26,499
it's no longer a choice we can make

2388
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:53,103
Time gone will no longer return

2389
01:37:53,440 --> 01:38:00,551
The past is only for you to ponder

2390
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:07,303
Recalling our old playmates from childhood

2391
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:10,650
with each others company day and night

2392
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:15,060
Setting of firecrackers
for a smooth-sailing year

2393
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:21,651
The flower blooms red in the spring breeze

2394
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:27,944
and you are another year older

2395
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:35,080
Your change of heart is
irreversible just like time

2396
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:36,326
Turn it

2397
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:37,174
Alright now?

2398
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,359
Not clear

2399
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:40,374
My hands are aching from tuning this

2400
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:41,458
It's still not clear

2401
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:42,163
Done

2402
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:43,144
Done

2403
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:53,863
This is the flat

2404
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:54,938
Built just like a pigeon's cage

2405
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,598
Not bad. It's built perfectly straight

2406
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:57,772
Not reeling right or left

2407
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:59,734
This is the elevator

2408
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,258
Press this button

2409
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,932
Why do they call it taking the lift?

2410
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:05,189
There are no seats for us to take

2411
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:06,315
How can they call it taking the lift'?

2412
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,207
What are you doing?

2413
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:08,127
Circumcision

2414
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:08,883
Circumcision?

2415
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:09,683
<i>N</i> got cut

2416
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:10,198
Got cut?

2417
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:11,668
Your 'little bird" got cut

2418
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:12,750
What pain?

2419
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:13,818
Stop pretending

2420
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,683
Your Father here did it twice

2421
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:19,222
I lost two of my teeth. Look

2422
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:19,718
Look

2423
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:21,224
It's still there

2424
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:21,741
I fixed them back

2425
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,376
We are giving our daughter to them

2426
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,414
they should be the one to give us dowry

2427
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,559
We, the citizens of Singapore

2428
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:30,052
regardless of race, language or religion

2429
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:34,795
<i>I am</i> afraid Sis

2430
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,143
will take the compensation money for the farm

2431
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:37,889
give it to her lover

2432
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,558
and do the Lim Family wrong

2433
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:41,296
How can you say that'?

2434
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:42,833
For money, you slander me

2435
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:45,508
Don't think I dare not hit you
because your Mother is here

2436
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,340
Why did you hit my son?

2437
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,119
He has always been quiet

2438
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:55,805
Now that he has a girlfriend,
he is afraid we'll find out

2438
01:39:56,305 --> 01:40:02,869
