1
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,899
My dad was a farmer.

2
00:01:24,787 --> 00:01:27,966
Like everybody else back then.

3
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:31,814
Of course he didn't start that way.

4
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,289
The computer says you're too tight.

5
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,247
No, I got this!
-Crossing the Straits.

6
00:01:45,025 --> 00:01:46,904
I've got to shut it down Cooper.
-Heyyy.

7
00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:50,951
Shutting all down...
-Hey, we do not have to shut down  anything!

8
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,009
Dad?

9
00:02:01,445 --> 00:02:05,413
Sorry Murph. Go back to bed babe.

10
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:07,122
I thought you were the ghost.

11
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,748
There's no such thing as a ghost babe.
-Grandpa says that you can get ghosts.

12
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:17,515
No, that's because
grandpa is too close to...

13
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,193
...being one himself. Go back to bed.

14
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,233
Were you dreaming about the crash?

15
00:02:23,532 --> 00:02:26,121
Get your butt back in bed Murph.

16
00:02:52,174 --> 00:02:54,702
The wheat had died.

17
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:58,860
The blight came and we had to burn it.
We still had corn.

18
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,777
We had acres of corn.
But mostly we had dust.

19
00:03:06,315 --> 00:03:08,943
I guess I can't describe it.
It was just constant.

20
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:13,431
Just that, steady blow of dirt.

21
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,868
We wore little strips of sheet...

22
00:03:17,988 --> 00:03:22,935
...sometimes over our nose and mouth.
So we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

23
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:28,832
Well when we set the table we always
set the plate upside down.

24
00:03:28,982 --> 00:03:31,550
Glasses or cups, whatever it was, upside down.

25
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:41,184
Shake a leg. Murph, get your move on.
-One o'clock today, you and me...

26
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,752
...in the barn, Herbicide Resistance 101, check?
-Yessir.

27
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,660
Not at the table Murph!

28
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:50,368
Dad, can you fix this?

29
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:54,785
What the heck did you do to my lander?
-It wasn't me.

30
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:58,543
Let me guess. It was your ghost.
-It knocked it off my shelf.

31
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,351
It also knocks the books off.
-There's no such thing as ghosts dumbass.

32
00:04:01,461 --> 00:04:03,630
Hey.
-I looked it up, it's called a poltergeist.

33
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,337
Dad, tell her.
-Well, that's not very scientific Murph.

34
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:11,225
You said that science was about admitting what we don't know.
-She's got you there.

35
00:04:11,345 --> 00:04:13,434
Hey, start looking after all our stuff.

36
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:16,173
Coop.

37
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:20,959
Alright Murph, you wanna talk science?

38
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:25,426
Don't just tell me that you're afraid of some ghost.
No, you gotta go further.

39
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:27,655
You have to record the facts, analyze...

40
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:31,972
...get to the how and the why and present your conclusions.
Deal?

41
00:04:32,082 --> 00:04:34,341
Deal.
-All right!

42
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,868
Have a good day at school.
-Hold up.

43
00:04:38,938 --> 00:04:43,205
Parent-Teacher conferences,
parent, not grandparent.

44
00:04:46,084 --> 00:04:50,191
Slow down turbo.
That's not a dust storm.

45
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:53,269
Nelson's torching his whole crop.
-Blight?

46
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:57,927
They're saying it's the last harvest for okra.
Ever.

47
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:04,703
He should have planted corn like the rest of us.
-Now you be nice to that Miss Hanley.

48
00:05:04,823 --> 00:05:07,160
She's single.
-Well what's that supposed to mean?

49
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,529
Repopulating the Earth.
-Start pulling your weight young man.

50
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:14,726
Why don't you start minding
your own business? Old man!

51
00:05:21,832 --> 00:05:23,311
All right Murph give me second.

52
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,318
Aha,....thirrrd.

53
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:33,245
Find a gear dumbass.
-Grind it! -Shut it Tom!

54
00:05:34,154 --> 00:05:37,043
Whatcha do Murph?
-Ahh, she didn't do nothing.

55
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:40,710
Blew a tire is all.
-Murphy's Law.
-Shut up!

56
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,609
Grab the spare Tom.
-That is the spare.

57
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,807
Get the patch kit.

58
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:50,424
And how am I supposed to patch it out here?

59
00:05:50,495 --> 00:05:53,902
You'll have to figure it out. I'm not always
gonna be here to help you.

60
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:04,285
What's goin' on Murph?

61
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:09,083
Why did you and mom name me after something that's bad?
-No we didn't?

62
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:10,991
Murphy's Law?

63
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,239
Murphy's Law doesn't mean that something bad...

64
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:18,147
...will happen.
What it means is whatever can happen...

65
00:06:18,147 --> 00:06:21,855
...will happen.
And that sounded just fine with us.

66
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:29,640
Get in.

67
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:32,339
Get in, let's go.

68
00:06:33,718 --> 00:06:36,206
What about the flat tire?

69
00:06:38,844 --> 00:06:39,724
Yes.

70
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:58,693
It is an Indian Air Force drone.
Solar cells could power an entire farm.

71
00:06:58,812 --> 00:06:59,711
Take the wheel Tom.

72
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:07,846
Go, go go!

73
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:09,555
Keep it pointed at that.

74
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,478
Faster Tom, we're losing it.
-Yes.

75
00:07:20,558 --> 00:07:22,428
Point right at it.

76
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:27,834
Hang on, here we go, here we go.

77
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:37,868
Nice driving Tom.

78
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:48,742
Dad?
-Almost got it, don't stop, don't stop.

79
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:51,790
Dad?!
Tom!!!

80
00:07:56,566 --> 00:07:58,546
Wha..? You told me to keep driving.

81
00:07:59,985 --> 00:08:04,012
Well I guess that answers the ol'
'if I ask you to drive off a cliff' scenario.

82
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:10,108
We lost it.
-No we didn't!

83
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:24,449
Wanna give it a whirl?

84
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,828
Let's land it down there,
right at the edge of the reservoir.

85
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:48,504
Nicely done!

86
00:08:50,623 --> 00:08:53,391
How long do you think it's been up there?

87
00:08:53,471 --> 00:08:57,339
Delhi Mission Control went down
same as ours, 10 years ago.

88
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,117
So for 10 years?

89
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:05,764
Why'd it come down so low?
-I don't know.

90
00:09:05,874 --> 00:09:10,011
Maybe the sun cooked it's brain
or it was looking for something.
-What?

91
00:09:10,121 --> 00:09:13,559
Give me that large flatblade
Maybe some kind of signal.

92
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:14,848
I don't know.

93
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,474
What are you gonna do with it?

94
00:09:21,554 --> 00:09:25,402
I'm gonna give it something socially
responsible to do...

95
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:29,969
...like driving a combine.
-Can't we just, let it go?

96
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:33,417
It wasn't hurting anybody.

97
00:09:35,465 --> 00:09:39,563
Listen, this thing needs to learn how to adapt Murph,
like the rest of us.

98
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,368
So how's this work? Do you guys come with?
-I've got class.

99
00:09:47,448 --> 00:09:49,937
This one, needs to wait.

100
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:54,164
What did you do?
-They'll tell you about it when you get in there.

101
00:09:54,234 --> 00:09:56,733
Well am I gonna be mad?
-Not with me.

102
00:09:56,843 --> 00:09:58,132
Just please, try not to.

103
00:09:58,252 --> 00:10:02,139
Hey, relax....I got this.

104
00:10:06,627 --> 00:10:10,014
You're late Coop.
-Yeah, we had a flat.

105
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:14,052
And I guess you had to stop off
at Asian fighter plane store.

106
00:10:14,162 --> 00:10:17,399
No actually sir, that's a, that's
a surveillance drone.

107
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:21,307
With outstanding solar cells. It's Indian.
-Take a seat.

108
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:27,604
So, we got Tom's scores back.

109
00:10:27,713 --> 00:10:32,430
He's gonna make an excellent farmer.
-Yeah he's got a knack for it.

110
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,799
What about college?

111
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,157
Well the university only takes a handful.
They don't really have the resources.

112
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:43,154
-I still pay my taxes.
Where does that money go? There's no more armies.

113
00:10:43,264 --> 00:10:45,152
Well, they don't go to the university.

114
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:48,000
Look Coop, you have to be realistic.

115
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:52,478
You're ruling my son out for college now?
The kid's 15.

116
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:57,125
Tom's score simply isn't high enough.
-What's your waistline?

117
00:10:57,205 --> 00:11:01,992
How about 32, about 33 inseam?
-I'm not sure I see where you're getting at.

118
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:04,231
You're telling me it takes two numbers
to measure your own ass...

119
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,679
...but only one to measure my son's future?

120
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:10,387
Come on, you're a well-educated man Coop...

121
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:12,735
...and a trained pilot.
-And an engineer.

122
00:11:12,775 --> 00:11:17,593
Okay well right now, we don't need more engineers.

123
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:22,669
We didn't run out of television screens or planes;
we ran out of food!

124
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:27,137
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers like you, and Tom.

125
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:31,974
Uneducated farmers.
-We are a caretaker generation Coop.

126
00:11:32,094 --> 00:11:35,792
And things are getting better.
Maybe your grandkids will get to be...

127
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:36,511
-Are we done here sir?

128
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,987
No.
Miss Hanley is here to talk about Murph.

129
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:46,965
Murph is a great kid, she's really bright.
But she's been having a little trouble lately.

130
00:11:47,035 --> 00:11:51,412
She brought this in to show the other students.
The section on the lunar landings.

131
00:11:51,482 --> 00:11:55,939
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.
She always loved the pictures.

132
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:59,936
It's an old federal textbook.
We've replaced them with the corrected versions.

133
00:12:00,016 --> 00:12:04,774
Corrected?
-Explaining how the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt...

134
00:12:04,814 --> 00:12:05,962
...the Soviet Union.

135
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:14,478
You don't believe we went to the Moon?

136
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:18,985
I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda
that the Soviets bankrupted themselves...

137
00:12:19,015 --> 00:12:22,612
...pouring resources into rockets and other useless machines.

138
00:12:22,723 --> 00:12:24,162
Useless machines?

139
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:28,149
And if we don't want a repeat of the
excess and wastefulness of the 20th century...

140
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:32,007
...then we need to teach our kids about this planet.
Not tales of leaving it.

141
00:12:32,116 --> 00:12:36,704
Y'know one of those useless machines they used to make
was called an MRI.

142
00:12:36,814 --> 00:12:40,311
And if we had any of those left,
the doctors would've been able to find...

143
00:12:40,381 --> 00:12:44,339
...the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died; instead of afterwards.

144
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:48,107
And then she would have been the one sitting here
listening to this instead of me...

145
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:52,874
...which would've been a good thing because
she was always the... the calmer one.

146
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:56,122
I'm sorry about your wife Mr. Cooper.

147
00:12:56,302 --> 00:13:00,669
But Murph got into a fistfight with several of her classmates...

148
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:03,068
...over this Apollo nonsense.

149
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:06,216
So we thought it would be best to bring you in
and see what ideas you might have...

150
00:13:06,256 --> 00:13:09,024
...for dealing with her behaviour on the home front.

151
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:12,792
Yeah, you know what,
there's a game tomorrow night.

152
00:13:12,952 --> 00:13:16,669
She's going through a bit of a baseball phase,
her favorite team is playing.

153
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:18,339
There's gonna be candy and soda...

154
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:24,225
...I think I'll take her to that.

155
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:33,229
How'd it go?
-I got you suspended.

156
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:35,488
What??
-Cooper.

157
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:41,164
This is Cooper, go.
-Coop, those combines you rebuilt went haywire.

158
00:13:41,244 --> 00:13:45,891
Just reset the controllers.
-I did that, but you should come take a look.

159
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:08,977
One by one they just teared off the fields
and headed over.

160
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:11,795
something's interfering with the compass.

161
00:14:11,905 --> 00:14:15,353
Magnetism. Or somethin' such.

162
00:14:57,977 --> 00:15:02,194
There's nothing special about which book.
I've been working on it, like you said.

163
00:15:02,264 --> 00:15:05,533
I counted the spaces.
-Why?

164
00:15:07,081 --> 00:15:12,018
In case the ghost is trying to communicate.
I'm trying Morse.

165
00:15:12,098 --> 00:15:16,805
Morse?
-Yeah, dots and dashes. It's...

166
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,203
I know what Morse code is Murph.
But I still don't think your...

167
00:15:19,213 --> 00:15:21,402
...bookshelf is trying to talk to you.

168
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:37,272
Had to reset every compass clock
and GPS to offset off the anomaly.

169
00:15:37,422 --> 00:15:40,180
Which is?
-I don't know.

170
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,018
Now if the house had been built
on magnetic ore...

171
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:46,896
...we would have seen this the first
time we switched on the tractor.

172
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:52,853
I hear your meeting at the
school didn't go so well.

173
00:15:54,372 --> 00:15:59,339
You heard?
It's like we've forgotten who we are, Donald.

174
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:04,296
Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.

175
00:16:06,895 --> 00:16:11,032
When I was a kid, it felt like
they made something new everyday.

176
00:16:11,142 --> 00:16:14,270
Some gadget or idea.

177
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:19,016
Like every day was Christmas.
But 6, billion people,

178
00:16:19,086 --> 00:16:21,006
Just try to imagine that.

179
00:16:21,575 --> 00:16:25,353
And every last one of them
trying to have it all.

180
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:30,310
This world isn't so bad.

181
00:16:33,378 --> 00:16:36,676
And Tom will do just fine.
You're the one who doesn't belong.

182
00:16:36,756 --> 00:16:39,444
Born 40 years too late
or 40 years too early.

183
00:16:40,384 --> 00:16:42,902
My daughter knew it. God bless her.

184
00:16:44,242 --> 00:16:46,789
And your kids know it,
especially Murph.

185
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:50,208
Ahh we used to look up to the sky and wonder...

186
00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:53,605
...at our place in the stars.

187
00:16:55,954 --> 00:16:57,892
Now we just look down,

188
00:16:58,002 --> 00:17:00,961
and worry about our place in the dirt.

189
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:03,509
Cooper, you were good at something,

190
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,187
and you never got a chance to do anything with it.

191
00:17:07,297 --> 00:17:09,016
I'm sorry.

192
00:17:10,465 --> 00:17:14,432
You didn't expect this dirt
that was giving you this food...

193
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:18,330
...to turn on you like that and destroy you.

194
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:23,318
In April I believe if I'm right,
15th of April I, I think.

195
00:17:23,347 --> 00:17:27,775
This just happened at about 1:30 when that thing
came off the top of the canyon.

196
00:17:27,844 --> 00:17:33,121
In my day we had real ball players. Who're these bums?

197
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:35,930
Well in my day, people were too busy...

198
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,337
...fighting over food to even play baseball.

199
00:17:38,377 --> 00:17:43,235
Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural.
I want a hot dog.

200
00:17:43,315 --> 00:17:45,654
School says you're gonna follow in my footsteps.

201
00:17:46,702 --> 00:17:49,761
I think that's great.
You think that's great?

202
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:53,658
You hate farming dad.
Grandpa said.

203
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:58,406
Grandpa said huh?
Listen, all that matters is how you feel about it.

204
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:02,653
I like what you do.
I like our farm.

205
00:18:02,803 --> 00:18:04,781
And you're gonna be great at it.

206
00:18:17,654 --> 00:18:19,203
Let's get outta here.

207
00:18:27,027 --> 00:18:31,195
All right it's a doozy.
Alright gang, lets mask up.

208
00:18:34,543 --> 00:18:36,312
Tom, Murph? -Check.
-Check?

209
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:32,217
Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?

210
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:37,564
Murph.

211
00:19:58,272 --> 00:20:03,119
The ghost.
-Grab your pillow.

212
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:05,577
You're sleeping with Tom.

213
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:02,302
It's not a ghost.

214
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:08,958
It's gravity.

215
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:13,445
I'm dropping Tom, then heading into town.

216
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:17,872
You wanna clean that up? When you've finished praying to it.

217
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:45,855
It's not Morse Murph, it's binary.

218
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:48,384
Thick is 1, thin is 0.

219
00:21:52,122 --> 00:21:53,671
Coordinates.

220
00:22:06,953 --> 00:22:11,839
That's it.
-I can't miss this.

221
00:22:11,949 --> 00:22:14,498
Grandpa will be back in a couple of hours Murph.

222
00:22:15,587 --> 00:22:17,546
But you don't know what you're gonna find.

223
00:22:18,465 --> 00:22:23,462
And that, is why I can't take you.

224
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:30,588
Murph?

225
00:22:31,707 --> 00:22:35,994
Grandpa will be home in a while, tell
him I'll call him on the radio.

226
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,099
Jesus!
What're you doing?

227
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,807
Oh d'you think it's funny? Huh?

228
00:22:48,887 --> 00:22:51,715
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.

229
00:22:53,693 --> 00:22:56,132
Make yourself useful.

230
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,113
Hey Murph.

231
00:24:01,162 --> 00:24:02,811
Murph.

232
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:08,707
I think this is the end of the road.

233
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,204
Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?

234
00:24:15,084 --> 00:24:16,453
That's my girl.

235
00:24:43,036 --> 00:24:47,444
Step away from the fence.
-Don't shoot, don't shoot. I'm unarmed.

236
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:48,813
My daughter is in the car.

237
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:56,048
Don't be afraid.

238
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,967
How did you find this place?
-Where is my daughter?

239
00:25:13,077 --> 00:25:17,325
You had the coordinates for this facility marked on your map.
Where did you get those coordinates?

240
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:21,182
Where is my daughter?!
-Don't make me take you down again, sit down!

241
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:24,240
Oh d'you still think you're a Marine pal?

242
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,649
Marines don't exist. And you know what?

243
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:30,467
I've got grunts like you mowing my grass.

244
00:25:30,537 --> 00:25:34,644
Where did you find those coordinates?
-Unless you wanna end up as my second lawnmower...

245
00:25:35,294 --> 00:25:39,521
...no, I think I'll turn you into a valve of a vacuum or a dry cleaner.
No you won't.

246
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,479
TARS, back down please.

247
00:25:44,738 --> 00:25:47,806
You're taking a risk using
ex-military security.

248
00:25:47,926 --> 00:25:51,993
They are old and their control
units are unpredictable.

249
00:25:52,103 --> 00:25:54,003
It's what the government could spare.

250
00:25:55,562 --> 00:25:58,600
Who are you?
-Dr. Brand.

251
00:25:58,709 --> 00:26:03,567
Yeah I knew a Dr. Brand once, he was a Professor.
-What makes you think I'm not?

252
00:26:03,677 --> 00:26:05,276
Wasn't near as cute either.

253
00:26:05,385 --> 00:26:09,133
Please Dr. Brand, I don't have
any idea what this is.

254
00:26:09,243 --> 00:26:12,401
But I'm scared for my daughter,
and I want her by my side.

255
00:26:12,481 --> 00:26:15,000
You give me that, and I'll tell you
anything you want to know.

256
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:20,566
Take the principal and the girl
to the conference room.

257
00:26:21,756 --> 00:26:25,613
Your daughter is fine.
Bright kid.

258
00:26:25,693 --> 00:26:30,230
Must have a very smart mother.
-It's pretty clear you don't want any visitors.

259
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,637
Why don't you let us back up from your fence
and we'll be on our way, huh?

260
00:26:34,787 --> 00:26:37,565
It's not that simple.
-Well, sure it is.

261
00:26:37,675 --> 00:26:40,653
Look I don't know anything about you.
I don't know anything about this place.

262
00:26:40,763 --> 00:26:42,992
Yes you do.

263
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,758
Dad!

264
00:26:52,686 --> 00:26:53,986
Hello Cooper.

265
00:26:55,245 --> 00:26:56,464
Professor Brand.

266
00:26:57,803 --> 00:27:00,432
Explain to me how you found this facility.

267
00:27:00,512 --> 00:27:03,969
Kind of accidently stumbled upon it.
We were on a salvage run...

268
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:06,598
You're sitting in the best kept secret in the world.

269
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:09,496
Nobody stumbles in here, nobody stumbles out.

270
00:27:10,376 --> 00:27:14,433
Cooper, please, cooperate with these people.

271
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:18,750
Well, it's kinda hard to explain.

272
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,858
We we.., we learnt these coordinates...

273
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:25,496
...from an anomaly.
-What sort of anomaly?

274
00:27:25,606 --> 00:27:29,423
I hesitate to term it supernatural
but it damn well wasn't scientific...

275
00:27:29,544 --> 00:27:34,381
You're gonna have to be specific
Mr. Cooper, right now.
-It was gravity.

276
00:27:39,328 --> 00:27:42,136
Um what sort of gravitational
an- where was this thing?

277
00:27:42,216 --> 00:27:45,624
Hey, I'm real happy that you're excited
about gravity bud, but...

278
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:50,191
...you're not getting any answers from us
until I get assurances.
-Assurances? -Yeah.

279
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:55,228
Like that we're getting out of here, and
I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

280
00:27:56,577 --> 00:28:01,054
Don't you know who we are Coop?
-No Professor, I don't.

281
00:28:01,164 --> 00:28:04,762
You know my father Professor Brand.
We're NASA.

282
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:08,780
NASA.
-NASA.

283
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:11,448
The same NASA, you flew for.

284
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:25,230
I heard they shut you down sir,
for refusing to drop bombs from...

285
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,737
...the stratosphere on the starving people.

286
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:30,456
When they realized that killing other people...

287
00:28:30,456 --> 00:28:34,984
...was not a long term solution,
then they needed us back. In secret.

288
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:39,621
Why secret?
-Because public opinion wouldn't allow
spending on space exploration.

289
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,449
Not when you're struggling to put food on the table.

290
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,836
Blight. Wheat, seven years ago.

291
00:28:47,955 --> 00:28:51,113
Okra, this year.
-Now, there's just corn.

292
00:28:51,223 --> 00:28:53,822
And we're growing more than we ever had.

293
00:28:53,931 --> 00:28:58,279
Yeah, but like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the dust bowl...

294
00:28:58,388 --> 00:29:03,066
...the corn will die. Soon.

295
00:29:08,142 --> 00:29:11,930
We'll find a way, Professor, we always have.

296
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,828
Driven by the unshakeable faith
that the Earth is ours?

297
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:18,956
Well not just ours, no.

298
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,485
But it is our home.

299
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:26,131
Earth's atmosphere is 80% nitrogen.

300
00:29:26,241 --> 00:29:28,171
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

301
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,897
Blight does, and as it thrives,
our air gets less and less oxygen.

302
00:29:32,997 --> 00:29:36,825
The last people to starve, will be the first to suffocate.

303
00:29:36,945 --> 00:29:39,224
And your daughter's generation...

304
00:29:40,123 --> 00:29:42,991
...will be the last to survive on Earth.

305
00:29:43,102 --> 00:29:47,068
Murph is feeling a little tired, and was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office?

306
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:48,597
Yeah, thank you.

307
00:29:51,526 --> 00:29:52,645
Okay.

308
00:29:52,785 --> 00:29:56,852
Now you need to tell me, what your plan is to save the world?

309
00:29:58,182 --> 00:30:01,800
We're not meant to save the world.
We're meant to leave it.

310
00:30:07,246 --> 00:30:11,823
Rangers.
-The last components of our one versatile ship in orbit.

311
00:30:11,903 --> 00:30:15,731
The Endurance.
Our final expedition.

312
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:19,809
You sent people out there looking for a new home?

313
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,807
The Lazarus missions.
-Sounds cheerful!

314
00:30:22,917 --> 00:30:27,174
Lazarus came back from the dead.
-Sure, but he had to die in the first place.

315
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,703
There's not a planet in our
solar system that could sustain...

316
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:33,181
...life and the nearest
star is over a 1000 years away.

317
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:35,319
I mean, it doesn't even qualify as futile.

318
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,747
Where did you send them?

319
00:30:38,817 --> 00:30:44,614
Cooper, I can't tell you any more
unless you agree to pilot this craft.

320
00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:49,121
You're the best pilot we ever had.
-I barely left the stratosphere.

321
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,529
This team never left the simulator!

322
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,067
We need a pilot, and this is
the mission that you were trained for.

323
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:57,146
What, without even knowing?

324
00:30:57,296 --> 00:31:02,242
An hour ago, you didn't even know I was alive,
and you were going anyway.

325
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:06,380
We had no choice.
But something sent you here.

326
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,988
They chose you.
-Who's 'They'?

327
00:31:16,734 --> 00:31:20,801
How long, would I be gone?
-Hard to know.

328
00:31:20,911 --> 00:31:24,819
Years.
-I've got kids Professor.

329
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:28,087
Get out there, and save them.

330
00:31:31,035 --> 00:31:34,773
Who's 'They'?
-We started detecting gravitational anomalies,

331
00:31:34,882 --> 00:31:36,621
almost 50 years ago.

332
00:31:36,651 --> 00:31:40,299
Mostly small distortions to our
instruments in the upper atmosphere.

333
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:43,577
In fact I believe you encountered one yourself.

334
00:31:43,687 --> 00:31:45,986
Yeah, in the Straits.

335
00:31:46,096 --> 00:31:50,263
My crash, something tripped my fly-by-wire.

336
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:57,189
Exactly. But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this.

337
00:31:57,338 --> 00:32:01,256
Out near Saturn.
A disturbance of spacetime.

338
00:32:02,815 --> 00:32:06,943
Is that a wormhole?
-It appeared 48 years ago.

339
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:11,150
And it leads, where?
-Another galaxy.

340
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:15,617
A wormhole is not a naturally occuring phenomenon.

341
00:32:15,717 --> 00:32:18,256
Someone placed it there.
-'They'?

342
00:32:19,515 --> 00:32:23,483
And whoever they are,
they appear to be looking out for us.

343
00:32:23,592 --> 00:32:26,720
That wormhole let's us
travel to other stars.

344
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,999
It came right around when we needed it.

345
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:32,227
They've put potentially habitable
worlds right within our reach.

346
00:32:32,377 --> 00:32:36,245
Twelve, in fact from our initial probes.
-You sent probes into that?

347
00:32:36,384 --> 00:32:39,923
We sent people into it, 10 years ago.

348
00:32:40,032 --> 00:32:42,581
The Lazarus missions.

349
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:46,318
12 possible worlds, 12 Ranger launches.

350
00:32:46,318 --> 00:32:49,657
Carrying the bravest humans ever to live.

351
00:32:49,836 --> 00:32:52,615
Led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

352
00:32:52,894 --> 00:32:55,892
Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.

353
00:32:55,952 --> 00:32:57,541
But they could use hibernation to stretch that...

354
00:32:57,651 --> 00:33:01,649
...making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

355
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:04,047
Their mission was to assess their world and...

356
00:33:04,127 --> 00:33:07,835
...if it showed potential, then they could send
out a signal and bed down for the long nap...

357
00:33:07,935 --> 00:33:12,262
...wait to be rescued.
-And what if the world didn't show promise?

358
00:33:12,652 --> 00:33:14,301
Hence the bravery.

359
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:18,638
You don't have the resources to visit all 12.
-No.

360
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,546
Data transmission back through the wormhole is rudimentary.

361
00:33:22,656 --> 00:33:25,544
Simple binary pings on an annual basis...

362
00:33:25,635 --> 00:33:30,331
...give us some clue as to which worlds have potential.
One system shows promise.

363
00:33:30,401 --> 00:33:32,700
Well one, that's a bit of a long shot isn't it?

364
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:36,297
One system with 3 potential worlds?

365
00:33:36,407 --> 00:33:38,197
Not a long shot.

366
00:33:40,605 --> 00:33:44,423
Wait.
So if we find a home...

367
00:33:48,101 --> 00:33:51,378
...then what?
-That's the long shot.

368
00:33:51,538 --> 00:33:54,736
There is a plan A, and a plan B.

369
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:58,763
Did you notice anything
strange about the launch chamber?

370
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:12,945
This entire facility is a centrifuge.

371
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:18,072
Some kind of vehicle? A space station?
-Both. The plan A.

372
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,690
How do you get it off the ground?

373
00:34:19,871 --> 00:34:24,109
The first gravitational
anomalies changed everything.

374
00:34:24,258 --> 00:34:28,645
Suddenly we knew that harnessing gravity
was real.

375
00:34:28,785 --> 00:34:32,663
So I started working on a theory and we started...

376
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:35,981
...building this station.
-But you haven't solved it yet.

377
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,819
That's why there's a plan B.

378
00:34:38,999 --> 00:34:41,168
The problem is gravity.

379
00:34:41,308 --> 00:34:44,146
How to get a viable amount of human life
off the planet?

380
00:34:44,336 --> 00:34:48,333
This is one way. The plan B.
Population bomb.

381
00:34:48,443 --> 00:34:52,670
Over 5000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

382
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,287
How would you raise 'em?
-With the equipment onboard we incubate the first ten.

383
00:34:58,447 --> 00:35:02,065
After that, with surrogacy
the growth becomes exponential.

384
00:35:02,215 --> 00:35:06,232
In 30 years, we could have
a colony of hundreds.

385
00:35:06,352 --> 00:35:10,430
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

386
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,599
This will take care of that.

387
00:35:11,779 --> 00:35:16,486
Yeah, but what about the people here?
You just, you'd give up on 'em?

388
00:35:16,635 --> 00:35:21,603
My kids?
-That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

389
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:27,179
How far have you got?
-Almost there.

390
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:30,197
You're asking me to hang everything...

391
00:35:30,357 --> 00:35:34,814
...on an 'almost'.
-I'm asking you to trust me.

392
00:35:37,403 --> 00:35:39,921
Find us a new home.

393
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:44,518
And by the time you return,
I would've solved the problem...

394
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:48,076
...of gravity.
I give you my word.

395
00:36:00,738 --> 00:36:02,038
Go away!

396
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:17,099
Murph.
-Go. If you're leaving just go!

397
00:36:19,587 --> 00:36:23,755
This world was never enough for you,
was it Cooper?

398
00:36:23,835 --> 00:36:28,292
What, cause heading out there is what I feel like...
...I was born to do?

399
00:36:28,382 --> 00:36:30,280
And it excites me?

400
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:34,747
Nah, it does not make it wrong.
-It might.

401
00:36:34,898 --> 00:36:38,685
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

402
00:36:39,135 --> 00:36:43,712
The 'why' of the thing, that's the foundation.
-And the foundation's solid.

403
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:49,588
We farmers, we sit here every year when...

404
00:36:49,628 --> 00:36:53,556
...the rains fail, and we say:
Next year.

405
00:36:53,696 --> 00:36:57,763
Well, next year ain't gonna save us, nor the one after that.

406
00:36:57,873 --> 00:37:02,570
This world's a treasure Donald,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

407
00:37:06,968 --> 00:37:11,096
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.

408
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:18,750
Tom will be alright,
but you got to make things right with Murph.
-I will.

409
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,808
Without making promises you don't know you can keep.

410
00:37:32,332 --> 00:37:35,240
You have to talk to me Murph.

411
00:37:36,749 --> 00:37:40,127
I need to fix this before I go.

412
00:37:40,288 --> 00:37:42,755
Then I'll keep it broken so you'll have to stay.

413
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:49,861
After you kids came along, your mom, she
said something to me I never quite understood.

414
00:37:50,012 --> 00:37:54,748
She said: Now, we're just here...

415
00:37:55,578 --> 00:37:57,916
...to be the memories for our kids.

416
00:38:02,554 --> 00:38:05,512
I think I now understand what she meant.

417
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,127
Once you're a parent, you're the
ghost of your children's future.

418
00:38:14,216 --> 00:38:17,035
You said ghosts didn't exist.

419
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,790
That's right Murph.

420
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:29,786
Look at me.

421
00:38:32,265 --> 00:38:34,804
I can't be your ghost right now.

422
00:38:36,532 --> 00:38:38,541
I need to exist.

423
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,558
They chose me.

424
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:46,596
Murph, they chose me. You saw it.
You're the one who led me to 'em.

425
00:38:48,715 --> 00:38:52,083
And that's exactly why you can't go!

426
00:38:55,151 --> 00:39:00,118
I figured out the message.
One word. You know what it is?

427
00:39:00,228 --> 00:39:02,836
Murph.
-STAY.

428
00:39:02,986 --> 00:39:06,254
It says STAY dad.
-Murph.

429
00:39:06,365 --> 00:39:11,161
You don't believe me!
Look at the books. Look it says STAY.

430
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:15,678
Why are you not listening? IT SAYS STAY!
-I'm coming back.

431
00:39:15,778 --> 00:39:17,907
When??

432
00:39:29,979 --> 00:39:33,767
One for you.
One for me.

433
00:39:33,867 --> 00:39:35,776
When I'm up there in hypersleep,

434
00:39:35,966 --> 00:39:39,493
or, or traveling at the speed of light,

435
00:39:39,683 --> 00:39:42,132
or, near a black hole,

436
00:39:42,282 --> 00:39:45,580
Time is gonna change for me.

437
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,898
And it's gonna run more slowly.

438
00:39:48,028 --> 00:39:51,017
So, when we get back,

439
00:39:51,197 --> 00:39:55,844
we're gonna compare.
-Time will run differently for us?

440
00:39:55,953 --> 00:39:56,783
Yeah.

441
00:39:56,903 --> 00:40:01,031
Maybe by the time I get back,
you and I, we might be the same age.

442
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,699
You and me.
What??

443
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:05,288
Imagine that!

444
00:40:08,925 --> 00:40:12,993
Ah, Murph.
-You've no idea when you're coming back!!

445
00:40:14,472 --> 00:40:18,260
No idea at all!
-Murph.

446
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:23,577
Murph, don't ma-, don't make me leave like this.
Murph!

447
00:40:23,756 --> 00:40:26,355
Don't make me leave like this Murph!!

448
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:37,128
Hey,...I love you.

449
00:40:37,308 --> 00:40:41,136
You hear me?
I love you forever.

450
00:40:41,286 --> 00:40:42,645
And I'm coming back.

451
00:40:48,661 --> 00:40:50,140
I'm coming back.

452
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:10,598
How did it go?
-Fine.

453
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:12,147
Just fine.

454
00:41:20,052 --> 00:41:24,989
I love you Tom. -Travel safe, okay?
-Yeah. Take care of our place for me alright?

455
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:28,357
Huh?
-Uh huh.

456
00:41:31,345 --> 00:41:34,733
Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?
-You mean your truck?

457
00:41:36,321 --> 00:41:38,301
I'll make sure they bring it back.

458
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,868
Look after my kids Donald.

459
00:41:54,811 --> 00:41:58,478
Go for main engines. Start T minus 10.

460
00:41:58,938 --> 00:42:03,186
Dad!
-9 -Dad!!

461
00:42:03,216 --> 00:42:07,653
8, 7.
-DAD!!!

462
00:42:08,452 --> 00:42:12,999
6, 5.
Main engines start.

463
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:21,963
4, 3, 2, 1. Booster ignition, and.

464
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:32,687
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

465
00:42:35,416 --> 00:42:40,232
Prepare for stage one separation.

466
00:42:40,382 --> 00:42:42,171
Stage one.

467
00:42:47,968 --> 00:42:53,355
Everybody good? Plenty of
slaves for my robot colony?

468
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:58,921
They gave him a humor setting,
to fit in better with his unit.

469
00:42:58,921 --> 00:43:03,618
He thinks it relaxes us.
-A giant sarcastic robot!

470
00:43:04,947 --> 00:43:08,945
What a great idea!
-I have a cue light I could use when I'm joking, if you'd like?

471
00:43:08,975 --> 00:43:10,174
That wouldn't be a problem, no.

472
00:43:10,284 --> 00:43:14,381
Yeah you could use it to find your way back into the ship
after I blow you out the air lock.

473
00:43:14,531 --> 00:43:17,419
What's your humor setting TARS?

474
00:43:17,499 --> 00:43:20,417
100% -Let's bring it down to 75 please.

475
00:43:20,707 --> 00:43:23,365
Stage two separation.

476
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:36,648
All feeds going manual.
-Going manual.

477
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:42,774
Deactivate probe heater 1, 2 and 3.
-Check.

478
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:51,228
Taking control.
-This is handover to you.

479
00:43:54,327 --> 00:43:56,805
ABF check. Over.

480
00:43:56,955 --> 00:44:01,493
Retro thrusters fuel cells 1, 2, 3.

481
00:44:01,533 --> 00:44:05,160
100%
ex-mites.

482
00:44:12,436 --> 00:44:16,943
It's hard leaving everything.
My kids.

483
00:44:17,093 --> 00:44:21,030
Your father.
-We're gonna be spending a lot of time together,

484
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:24,708
-We should learn to talk.
-And when not to.

485
00:44:25,757 --> 00:44:30,575
Just being honest.
-Well you don't need to be that honest.

486
00:44:30,685 --> 00:44:35,112
Hey TARS, what's your honesty parameter?
-90%

487
00:44:35,251 --> 00:44:36,731
90%?

488
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,369
Absolute honesty
isn't always the most diplomatic...

489
00:44:40,489 --> 00:44:44,116
...nor the safest form of communication
with emotional beings.
-Okay!

490
00:44:44,226 --> 00:44:46,564
90% it is Dr. Brand.

491
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:53,620
We're coming up on the Endurance.
12 minutes out.

492
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:12,679
Okay taking control.

493
00:45:15,956 --> 00:45:18,904
Approaching module port, 500 meters.

494
00:45:31,807 --> 00:45:33,715
It's all you Doyle.

495
00:45:51,074 --> 00:45:54,742
Nice and easy Doyle, nice and easy.

496
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:02,528
Take us home.

497
00:46:08,943 --> 00:46:11,852
Target locked.

498
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:14,410
Target locked. -Well done.
-Okay, helmets on.

499
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:15,470
Good job.

500
00:46:48,779 --> 00:46:51,807
The door is not charging.
Never mind!

501
00:47:14,843 --> 00:47:18,341
Cooper, you should have control.
-Control here.

502
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,059
Communication with ring module active.

503
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:37,639
That's initiate.

504
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,393
Are we ready to spin?
-Just a sec.

505
00:47:58,326 --> 00:48:01,384
Hello CASE.
-Hello TARS.

506
00:48:02,104 --> 00:48:05,771
Okay, we're all set.
-All right let's do it.

507
00:48:35,444 --> 00:48:36,993
30% of spin.

508
00:48:42,759 --> 00:48:44,408
One g.

509
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:49,165
How is gravity treating you back there?

510
00:48:52,114 --> 00:48:56,080
Romilly, hey you okay?
-Yeah. -You all right?

511
00:48:56,191 --> 00:48:57,060
Yeah, no I just need a minute.

512
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,237
Okay, I think we have some dramamine
in the hibe pad, I'm just gonna go get that.

513
00:49:01,347 --> 00:49:04,626
It'll be in the cryo beds
Just be a sec. -Hey Brand?

514
00:49:04,736 --> 00:49:06,255
Yeah? -Bring a lot.

515
00:49:14,699 --> 00:49:18,357
Amelia, be safe.

516
00:49:18,517 --> 00:49:22,645
Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
-I will Dad.

517
00:49:22,755 --> 00:49:27,711
It looks good for your trajectory.
We've calculated, two years to Saturn.

518
00:49:27,821 --> 00:49:29,630
That's a lot of Dramamine.

519
00:49:30,779 --> 00:49:32,798
Look after my family will you please, sir?

520
00:49:32,938 --> 00:49:36,176
We'll be waiting for you, when you get back.

521
00:49:36,716 --> 00:49:41,243
A little older, a little wiser,
but happy to see you.

522
00:49:43,221 --> 00:49:46,680
'Do not go gentle into that good night,'

523
00:49:46,869 --> 00:49:51,566
'old age should burn and
rave at close of day,'

524
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:57,463
'Rage, rage against the dying of the light.'

525
00:49:58,672 --> 00:50:02,699
'Though wise men at their end,
know dark is right.'

526
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:05,718
'Because their words had forked no lightning they'

527
00:50:05,908 --> 00:50:09,275
'Do not go gentle, into that good night'

528
00:50:09,856 --> 00:50:14,602
'Rage, rage against the dying of the light.'

529
00:50:38,238 --> 00:50:39,957
Here, pills.

530
00:50:42,765 --> 00:50:46,892
So alone.
-We have each other. Dr. Mann had it worse.

531
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,301
I mean them.

532
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,918
It's a perfect planet and we're
not gonna find another one like it.

533
00:50:54,088 --> 00:50:58,435
No, it's not like, looking for a new condo.

534
00:50:58,586 --> 00:51:02,663
The human race is going to be, adrift.

535
00:51:02,803 --> 00:51:06,730
Desperate for a rock it can cling to
while it catches it's breath.

536
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,420
We need to find that rock,

537
00:51:09,328 --> 00:51:13,546
and our 3 prospects are at
the edge of what might sustain human life.

538
00:51:14,475 --> 00:51:18,753
Laura Miller's planet is the first.
Laura started our biology program.

539
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:27,237
Wolf Edmunds is here.
-Tell me about Edmunds.

540
00:51:28,277 --> 00:51:30,686
Oh, um, Wolf's a particle physicist.

541
00:51:33,284 --> 00:51:35,043
Any of them had any families?

542
00:51:36,452 --> 00:51:39,350
No, no attachments. My father insisted.

543
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:42,158
They'all knew the possibility of...

544
00:51:42,238 --> 00:51:45,166
...seeing another human being again.
I'm hoping we can surprise at least 3 of them.

545
00:51:45,316 --> 00:51:49,574
Dr. Mann?
-Dr. Mann, well, he's remarkable.  He's the best of us.

546
00:51:49,753 --> 00:51:52,631
He inspired 11 people to follow
him on the loneliest journey...

547
00:51:52,711 --> 00:51:54,661
...in human history.

548
00:51:54,701 --> 00:51:57,060
Scientists, explorers.
That's what I love.

549
00:51:57,209 --> 00:52:00,227
Y'know out there, we would face great odds.

550
00:52:00,387 --> 00:52:04,565
Death. But, not evil.

551
00:52:04,714 --> 00:52:07,043
You don't think nature can be evil?

552
00:52:07,193 --> 00:52:12,010
No. Formidable, frightening. But, no, not evil.

553
00:52:13,419 --> 00:52:17,307
Is a lion evil because it rips a gazelle to shreds?

554
00:52:17,456 --> 00:52:19,296
Just what we take with us then?

555
00:52:20,125 --> 00:52:24,152
Yeah. This crew represents the best of humanity.

556
00:52:24,302 --> 00:52:27,340
Even me, huh?
-Y'know what? We agreed, 90%.

557
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,649
Don't stay up.

558
00:52:29,749 --> 00:52:30,918
I'll be in a minute.

559
00:52:31,078 --> 00:52:35,216
Just remember Coop, you're literally wasting your breath.

560
00:52:41,632 --> 00:52:44,760
Hey TARS, let's go over that trajectory one more time.

561
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:49,676
8 months to Mars.
Gravity powered slingshot around,

562
00:52:49,797 --> 00:52:52,135
14 months to Saturn.
Nothing has changed on that.

563
00:52:52,285 --> 00:52:53,764
Let me ask you something.

564
00:52:56,243 --> 00:52:59,480
Dr. Brand and Edmunds.
-Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.

565
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:06,326
Dr. Brand and Edmunds, they close?
-I wouldn't know.

566
00:53:06,507 --> 00:53:09,395
Is that '90% wouldn't know' or '10% wouldn't know'?

567
00:53:09,545 --> 00:53:11,593
I also have a discretion setting Cooper.

568
00:53:13,252 --> 00:53:16,950
But not a poker-face slick.

569
00:53:28,433 --> 00:53:29,732
Hey guys.

570
00:53:29,872 --> 00:53:33,550
Dad's about to go down for the long nap.

571
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:36,498
and I just, wanted to give you an update.

572
00:53:36,648 --> 00:53:40,505
The Earth looks amazing from here.

573
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:44,793
You can't see any of the dust.

574
00:53:45,772 --> 00:53:49,190
I really hope you guys are doin', doin' great.

575
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:52,078
I know you're gonna get this message,

576
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:56,606
Professor Brand assured me that he was gonna get it to you.
Alright, okay I love you!

577
00:53:58,085 --> 00:54:00,213
Is it him?
-I don't think so Murph.

578
00:54:06,799 --> 00:54:09,178
You must be Donald.

579
00:54:10,467 --> 00:54:15,054
Hello Murph.
-Why are you in my dad's truck?

580
00:54:15,204 --> 00:54:17,863
He wanted me to bring it for your brother.

581
00:54:18,012 --> 00:54:20,641
He sent you a message.

582
00:54:24,068 --> 00:54:26,008
She's pretty upset with him for leaving.

583
00:54:26,157 --> 00:54:29,535
If you record any messages I can
get them transmitted to Cooper.

584
00:54:30,974 --> 00:54:38,030
Murph is a bright spark.
Maybe, I should fan the flame.

585
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:42,697
She's already making fools of her teachers,
well, maybe she should come and make a fool out of you.

586
00:54:43,997 --> 00:54:47,234
So where are they?
-Heading for Mars.

587
00:54:47,344 --> 00:54:51,731
The next time you hear from Cooper,
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

588
00:55:31,007 --> 00:55:35,064
They want me to repeat plant pathology.

589
00:55:35,214 --> 00:55:40,641
It sucks. But, they said I could start
advanced agriculture a year early.

590
00:55:41,111 --> 00:55:44,569
So...alright.
Well, I gotta go Dad.

591
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:45,828
Hope you're safe up there.

592
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:53,684
Sorry Coop, I asked Murph to say hi.

593
00:55:53,754 --> 00:55:58,690
But she's as stubborn as her old man.
I'll try again next time.

594
00:56:13,941 --> 00:56:15,350
Are you okay Rom?

595
00:56:16,579 --> 00:56:21,267
This gets to me Cooper.
This, this.

596
00:56:21,407 --> 00:56:24,864
Millimeters of aluminum protecting us
and then nothing...

597
00:56:25,004 --> 00:56:28,712
...out there for millions of miles, won't kill us in seconds.

598
00:56:29,791 --> 00:56:34,698
Did you know that some of
the finest solo yatchsmen in the world...

599
00:56:34,738 --> 00:56:39,396
...don't know how to swim?
They don't know, and if they go overboard, it's done.

600
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:43,222
We are explorers Rom.

601
00:56:44,562 --> 00:56:47,780
This is our boat.
Here.

602
00:57:14,793 --> 00:57:19,560
This is the, relay probe?
-In orbit around the wormhole.

603
00:57:19,681 --> 00:57:22,188
This is the wormhole and every
time we come around...

604
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:26,036
...we would receive images from
the other side of the foreign galaxy.

605
00:57:26,146 --> 00:57:29,635
Like swinging a periscope around.
-Exactly.

606
00:57:29,744 --> 00:57:33,652
So we got a pretty good idea,
what we're gonna find on the other side, huh?

607
00:57:34,941 --> 00:57:36,600
Navigationally.

608
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,317
Hey guys, looks like we're gonna be
approaching the wormhole in about three hours.

609
00:57:48,193 --> 00:57:51,331
Hey Coop, can we stop the spinning?

610
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,398
Why? -Because we are close enough to see it.

611
00:57:56,907 --> 00:57:59,576
Aha.

612
00:58:03,793 --> 00:58:08,000
Look, that's, that's it! That's the wormhole!

613
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:11,069
Say it, don't spray it Rom.
It's a sphere.

614
00:58:11,209 --> 00:58:14,766
Well of course it is!
What you thought it would just be a hole?

615
00:58:15,816 --> 00:58:19,694
No. It's just that all the illustrations I've ever seen they...

616
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:23,701
The illustrations, try to show how it works.

617
00:58:23,821 --> 00:58:28,019
So they say you want to go from here, to there.

618
00:58:28,178 --> 00:58:29,657
But this is too far.

619
00:58:29,847 --> 00:58:33,465
So a wormhole bends space like this so you...

620
00:58:33,495 --> 00:58:37,082
...can take a shortcut through a higher dimension.

621
00:58:37,192 --> 00:58:41,990
Okay so, to show that they've turned 3-dimensional space...

622
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:46,357
...into 2 dimensions, which turns a wormhole in 2 dimensions...

623
00:58:46,377 --> 00:58:49,525
...a circle.
What's a circle in 3 dimensions?

624
00:58:50,714 --> 00:58:53,882
A sphere.
-Exactly. A spherical hole.

625
00:58:54,422 --> 00:58:58,000
But who put it there?
Who do we have to thank?

626
00:58:58,229 --> 00:59:02,937
I'm not thanking anybody
until we get outta here in one piece Rom.

627
00:59:08,254 --> 00:59:11,352
Any trick to this Doyle?

628
00:59:12,721 --> 00:59:14,090
No one knows.

629
00:59:20,525 --> 00:59:23,364
The others made it, right?

630
00:59:25,133 --> 00:59:27,182
At least some of 'em.

631
00:59:57,883 --> 01:00:02,020
Everybody ready to say goodbye to our solar system?

632
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,748
To our galaxy.

633
01:00:06,297 --> 01:00:07,997
Here we go.

634
01:00:40,197 --> 01:00:43,654
Controls won't work here.
We are passing through the bulk.

635
01:00:43,764 --> 01:00:48,592
Its space beyond our 3 dimensions.
All you can do is report and observe.

636
01:00:58,496 --> 01:01:01,024
What is that?

637
01:01:02,294 --> 01:01:07,080
I think it's 'Them'.
-Distorting spacetime?

638
01:01:08,459 --> 01:01:10,758
Don't. Don't!

639
01:01:38,371 --> 01:01:39,330
What was that?

640
01:01:41,719 --> 01:01:43,837
First handshake.

641
01:01:45,517 --> 01:01:46,786
We're...

642
01:01:47,865 --> 01:01:49,194
We're here.

643
01:02:10,151 --> 01:02:13,360
So the lost communications came through.
-How?

644
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:18,426
The relay on this side cached them.
It's years of basic data, no real surprises.

645
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:23,923
Miller's site has kept pinging 'thumbs up',
as has Dr. Mann's.

646
01:02:23,953 --> 01:02:27,750
Edmunds went down three years ago.
-Transmitter failure?

647
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:30,748
Maybe.
He was sending the thumbs up right until it went dark.

648
01:02:30,898 --> 01:02:34,506
But Miller's still looks good though, right?
Because she's coming up fast.

649
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:36,855
But there's one complication.

650
01:02:36,935 --> 01:02:41,003
The planet is much closer to Gargantua
than we thought.

651
01:02:41,073 --> 01:02:44,200
Gargantua?
-It's what we're calling the black hole.

652
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:46,389
Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets both orbit it.

653
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:49,617
And Miller's is on the horizon?
-Like a basketball around a hoop.

654
01:02:49,727 --> 01:02:52,336
Landing there takes us dangerously close...

655
01:02:52,515 --> 01:02:55,603
...and a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

656
01:02:57,712 --> 01:03:01,240
Okay I-, I could swing around that neutron star...

657
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:03,898
-No no no, it's not that, it's time.
The gravity on that planet will...

658
01:03:04,048 --> 01:03:07,337
...slow our clock compared to Earth's,.. drastically.

659
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,095
Well how bad?

660
01:03:09,205 --> 01:03:16,001
Well, every hour we spend on that planet
will be, uhh, seven years back on Earth.

661
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:20,208
Jesus. -That's relativity folks.

662
01:03:21,338 --> 01:03:24,606
Well, we can't just drop down there without...
-Cooper...

663
01:03:24,755 --> 01:03:27,194
We have a mission.
-Yeah Doyle, we have a mission.

664
01:03:27,294 --> 01:03:29,833
And our mission, Plan A is to find a planet...

665
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:32,371
...that can habitate the people
that are living on the Earth right now.

666
01:03:32,481 --> 01:03:35,109
You can't just think about your family,
now you have to think bigger than that, alright?

667
01:03:35,259 --> 01:03:38,197
I'm thinking about my family
and millions of other families.

668
01:03:38,287 --> 01:03:43,204
Okay, Plan A does not work, if the people
on Earth are dead by the time we pull it off.

669
01:03:44,074 --> 01:03:47,441
No, it doesn't.
That's why there's a Plan B.

670
01:03:49,141 --> 01:03:53,608
Okay. Cooper's right.
We have to think about time as a resource just like...

671
01:03:53,718 --> 01:03:56,057
...oxygen and food.
Going down there is gonna cost us.

672
01:03:56,236 --> 01:04:02,422
Okay look, Dr. Mann's data is promising, alright,

673
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:06,050
but it's gonna take us months to get there,
and Edmunds, it's even further.

674
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,609
Now Miller hasn't said much.
But what she has said is very promising.

675
01:04:08,759 --> 01:04:11,517
It's water, it's organics.
-You don't find that everyday.

676
01:04:11,587 --> 01:04:15,034
No, you don't and just think about
the resources including time...

677
01:04:15,154 --> 01:04:17,403
...that would be spent trying to get back here.

678
01:04:18,892 --> 01:04:20,511
Romilly.
-Yeah.

679
01:04:20,551 --> 01:04:24,958
How far off of Miller's planet
do we have to be to stay out of the time shift?

680
01:04:24,988 --> 01:04:29,235
Alright, just back from the cusp.
-Which is here, just outside of Miller's planet.

681
01:04:29,356 --> 01:04:31,784
Alright. Okay.

682
01:04:31,904 --> 01:04:35,172
Here's Gargantua, here's Miller's planet.

683
01:04:35,312 --> 01:04:38,949
Instead of taking the Endurance
into orbit around Miller's planet, which would...

684
01:04:38,989 --> 01:04:41,797
...conserve fuel, but we'd lose a lot of time,

685
01:04:41,827 --> 01:04:46,365
what if, what if we take a wider orbit around Gargantua,
parallel with Miller's planet,

686
01:04:46,475 --> 01:04:49,893
outside of it's time shift, to here.
Then we take the Ranger down,

687
01:04:49,933 --> 01:04:52,911
we get Miller, we get her samples,
we come back, we analyze, we debrief...

688
01:04:52,951 --> 01:04:56,768
...we're in, we're out, we lose a little fuel.
But we save a lot of time.

689
01:04:56,878 --> 01:04:58,788
That'll work.
-That's good. -There's not gonna...

690
01:04:58,938 --> 01:05:02,685
be time for monkey business or chit-chat down there,
so TARS, you should definitely stay here.

691
01:05:03,834 --> 01:05:06,473
CASE, you're with me.
Anyone else can stay.

692
01:05:06,622 --> 01:05:08,931
If we are talking about a couple of years,

693
01:05:09,121 --> 01:05:11,200
I could use the time to research gravity,

694
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:13,828
observations from the wormhole,
that's gold to Professor Brand.

695
01:05:13,939 --> 01:05:18,236
TARS, factor an orbit around Gargantua,
conserve fuel, minimize thrusting.

696
01:05:18,346 --> 01:05:20,753
Make sure we stay in range
from Miller's planet. You got it?

697
01:05:20,874 --> 01:05:24,082
I wouldn't leave you behind, Dr. Brand.

698
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:32,427
You ready CASE? -Yep.
-You don't say much do you?

699
01:05:33,036 --> 01:05:37,323
TARS talks plenty for both of us.
-Detach.

700
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:47,498
Romilly, are you reading these forces?
-Unbelievable.

701
01:05:51,245 --> 01:05:52,934
A literal heart of darkness.

702
01:05:55,813 --> 01:06:00,080
If we could just see the collapsed star inside,

703
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:03,098
the singularity, we'd solve gravity.

704
01:06:03,218 --> 01:06:06,565
We can't get anything from it?
-Nothing escapes that horizon,

705
01:06:06,716 --> 01:06:10,613
not even light.
All the answers are there, just no way to see it.

706
01:06:10,763 --> 01:06:12,122
There's Miller's planet.

707
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:15,650
Goodbye Ranger.

708
01:06:28,402 --> 01:06:32,829
This is fast for atmospheric entry.
Shouldn't we use the thrusters to slow?

709
01:06:32,909 --> 01:06:36,997
-No.
I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics to save some fuel.

710
01:06:37,097 --> 01:06:40,125
Air-brake?
-We wanna get down fast don't we?

711
01:06:40,235 --> 01:06:43,633
Actually we wanna get there in one piece.
-Hang on.

712
01:06:43,703 --> 01:06:45,391
Brand, Doyle, get ready.

713
01:07:01,212 --> 01:07:03,941
We should be using the air-brake.
-Hands up CASE.

714
01:07:04,021 --> 01:07:07,438
The only time I ever went down is
when a machine was easing at the wrong time.

715
01:07:07,558 --> 01:07:10,666
You're going to get us killed.
-Just like reckless driving.

716
01:07:10,946 --> 01:07:12,585
We're too fast. -I got this.

717
01:07:17,312 --> 01:07:21,379
Should I get ready to detach?
-No. I need to feel the air.

718
01:07:25,387 --> 01:07:26,576
Here we go.

719
01:07:28,025 --> 01:07:30,824
It's just water!

720
01:07:30,934 --> 01:07:35,680
The stuff of life.
-1200 meters.

721
01:07:35,791 --> 01:07:38,869
Do we have a fix on her beacon?
-That I have, can you maneuver?

722
01:07:38,979 --> 01:07:43,775
I gonna need to shave some speed.
I'm gonna spiral down on top of it, everybody hang on!

723
01:07:45,185 --> 01:07:47,094
700.

724
01:07:49,042 --> 01:07:51,391
On my cue CASE, on my cue.

725
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:55,659
500 meters.

726
01:08:04,842 --> 01:08:06,281
Now!

727
01:08:20,354 --> 01:08:21,602
Very graceful.

728
01:08:21,673 --> 01:08:26,090
No, but very efficient.

729
01:08:27,549 --> 01:08:30,297
What're you waiting for?
Let's go.

730
01:08:30,367 --> 01:08:34,074
Go, go, go, go.
7 years per hour here.

731
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,473
Let's make it count.

732
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:02,527
This way.

733
01:09:05,156 --> 01:09:07,244
About 200 meters.

734
01:09:17,248 --> 01:09:21,846
Gravity's punishing.
-Been floating through space too long?

735
01:09:21,955 --> 01:09:24,254
130% Earth's gravity.

736
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:27,013
Come on, come on, come on.

737
01:09:29,171 --> 01:09:31,580
There's nothing here.
-should be right here.

738
01:09:33,248 --> 01:09:36,706
If the, if the signal's coming from here, then...

739
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,290
Her beacon.

740
01:09:55,245 --> 01:09:58,523
Wreckage.
-Where's the rest?

741
01:09:58,592 --> 01:10:00,321
Towards the mountains.

742
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,688
Those aren't mountains.

743
01:10:08,197 --> 01:10:10,545
They're waves.
-What?

744
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,522
Shit.

745
01:10:17,611 --> 01:10:19,729
That one's moving away from us.

746
01:10:24,806 --> 01:10:27,575
We need the recorder.

747
01:10:37,758 --> 01:10:40,457
Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!

748
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:42,805
I'm not, leaving, without, her data.

749
01:10:44,145 --> 01:10:48,402
Get back here now. We do not have time.
The second wave is coming!

750
01:10:48,522 --> 01:10:50,990
We are in the middle of a swell!

751
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:54,878
Get your ass back to the Ranger now!

752
01:10:58,406 --> 01:11:01,714
Brand get back here now!!

753
01:11:03,143 --> 01:11:07,050
Cooper, go, Cooper go, I can't make it. Go!

754
01:11:07,171 --> 01:11:08,389
CASE, go get her.

755
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:15,745
GO!
-Get up, get up Brand.

756
01:11:15,885 --> 01:11:17,604
Go go, go.

757
01:11:18,793 --> 01:11:22,461
I'm not gonna make it!
-Yes you are. Yes you are!

758
01:11:29,097 --> 01:11:31,675
Come on CASE has her, CASE has her! Get back here Doyle!

759
01:11:34,443 --> 01:11:35,922
Dr. Brand.

760
01:11:37,611 --> 01:11:39,371
To the hatch.

761
01:11:43,458 --> 01:11:45,397
Go, go. Go.

762
01:11:50,913 --> 01:11:54,951
Manually overriding inside hatch!

763
01:11:58,289 --> 01:12:02,996
Cooper don't!
Cooper don't!

764
01:12:03,166 --> 01:12:04,236
Cooper!

765
01:12:06,084 --> 01:12:09,922
Engines are flooded!
I'll have to shut it down!

766
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:44,701
Oh shit!!

767
01:12:49,477 --> 01:12:50,816
Whoaa!

768
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:25,096
CASE what's wrong?
-Chute's waterlogged, let it drain.

769
01:13:25,925 --> 01:13:29,483
Goddamn it!!
I told you to leave me.

770
01:13:29,593 --> 01:13:32,002
-And I told you to get your ass back here!

771
01:13:32,071 --> 01:13:35,689
The difference is that one of
us was thinkin' about the mission.

772
01:13:35,798 --> 01:13:37,638
-You were thinking about getting home!!

773
01:13:38,667 --> 01:13:43,634
I was trying to do the right thing!
-Can you tell that to Doyle?

774
01:13:45,572 --> 01:13:48,521
CASE, how much time?
-45 to an hour.

775
01:13:49,931 --> 01:13:51,639
The stuff of life huh?

776
01:13:52,689 --> 01:13:55,627
What's this gonna cost us Brand?
-A lot.

777
01:13:56,506 --> 01:13:57,316
Decades.

778
01:14:04,511 --> 01:14:07,389
What happened to Miller?
-Judging by...

779
01:14:07,499 --> 01:14:11,307
...the wreckage she was
broken up by a wave soon after impact.

780
01:14:11,417 --> 01:14:14,874
How's the hell the wreckage stayed together
after all these years, huh?

781
01:14:16,144 --> 01:14:17,723
Because of the time slippage.

782
01:14:17,863 --> 01:14:21,490
On this planet's time she,

783
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,620
she's landed hours ago, she...

784
01:14:23,689 --> 01:14:26,648
...she probably just died minutes ago.

785
01:14:26,757 --> 01:14:30,595
The data Doyle received was just the initial
status echoing endlessly.

786
01:14:30,715 --> 01:14:33,084
Oh we are not prepared for this.

787
01:14:35,492 --> 01:14:39,769
You eggheads have the survival skills
of a boy-scout troop.

788
01:14:39,799 --> 01:14:42,888
Well we got this far on our brains,
farther than any human in history.

789
01:14:43,207 --> 01:14:47,555
Well not far enough.
And now we're stuck here till there won't be anyone...

790
01:14:47,555 --> 01:14:48,744
...left on Earth to save.

791
01:14:50,662 --> 01:14:54,221
I'm counting every minute same as you Cooper.

792
01:14:57,968 --> 01:15:02,845
Is there any possibility?
I dunno, maybe some way, I don't know...

793
01:15:02,845 --> 01:15:06,973
...maybe if we could jump in a black hole
and gain back the years?

794
01:15:07,472 --> 01:15:10,821
Don't shake your head at me!
Time is relative, okay.

795
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:13,178
It can stretch and it can squeeze, but,

796
01:15:13,248 --> 01:15:16,996
it can't run backwards!
Just can't!

797
01:15:17,066 --> 01:15:21,264
The only thing that can move across dimensions,
like time, is gravity.

798
01:15:23,573 --> 01:15:24,892
Okay.

799
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,459
The beings that led us here,

800
01:15:29,569 --> 01:15:32,666
they communicate through gravity, right?

801
01:15:32,817 --> 01:15:36,734
Could they be talking to us from the future?
-Maybe.

802
01:15:36,844 --> 01:15:40,352
Okay, if they can..?
They...

803
01:15:40,462 --> 01:15:43,120
...are beings of 5 dimensions!

804
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:46,848
Right, to them, time might be
yet another physical dimension.

805
01:15:46,938 --> 01:15:51,475
To them, the past might be a canyon
they can climb into,

806
01:15:51,575 --> 01:15:56,302
and the future, a mountain that they can climb up,
but to us, it's not! Okay!

807
01:15:56,372 --> 01:16:00,309
Look Cooper, I screwed up.
I'm sorry.

808
01:16:01,609 --> 01:16:03,658
But you knew about relativity.

809
01:16:06,466 --> 01:16:07,435
Brand.

810
01:16:11,552 --> 01:16:14,511
My daughter is 10 years old.

811
01:16:14,631 --> 01:16:17,889
Couldn't teach her Einstein's theories before I left,

812
01:16:17,919 --> 01:16:22,566
Couldn't you have told your daughter
that you were going to save the world?
-No.

813
01:16:23,685 --> 01:16:28,392
When you become a parent,
one thing becomes really clear,

814
01:16:29,382 --> 01:16:33,190
And that's you wanna make sure your children feel safe,

815
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:38,016
and it rules out telling a 10 year old,
that the world's endin'.

816
01:16:40,325 --> 01:16:41,335
Cooper.

817
01:16:45,052 --> 01:16:48,450
How long for the engines CASE?
-A minute or two.

818
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,699
Well we don't have it!
Helmets on!!

819
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:59,184
Brand, co-pilot you're up.
CASE, run the cabin oxygen through the main thrusters.

820
01:16:59,294 --> 01:17:01,242
We're gonna spark it!
-Roger that.

821
01:17:01,352 --> 01:17:02,551
Depressurizing.

822
01:17:07,848 --> 01:17:09,068
Engines up!

823
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:41,957
Hello Rom!
-I've waited years.

824
01:17:43,106 --> 01:17:44,675
How many, how many years?

825
01:17:46,314 --> 01:17:51,281
By now it must be,
23 years, 4 months, 8 days.

826
01:17:55,029 --> 01:17:56,329
Doyle?

827
01:18:03,424 --> 01:18:06,772
I thought I was prepared...I knew the theory...

828
01:18:06,842 --> 01:18:09,360
...reality is different.

829
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:11,229
And Miller?

830
01:18:12,528 --> 01:18:14,397
There's nothing here for us.

831
01:18:18,075 --> 01:18:21,922
Why didn't you sleep?
-Oh I had a couple of stretches.

832
01:18:22,002 --> 01:18:24,880
I stopped believing that you were coming back.

833
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,799
Something seemed wrong about dreaming my life away.

834
01:18:27,868 --> 01:18:30,857
I learned what I could from the black hole

835
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:33,325
but I couldn't send anything to your father.

836
01:18:33,445 --> 01:18:38,213
We've been receiving but nothing gets out.
-Is he alive?

837
01:18:38,293 --> 01:18:41,251
Oh, yeah.
-Yeah? -Yeah.

838
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:48,176
We've got years of messages stored.
-Cooper.

839
01:18:48,286 --> 01:18:51,634
Messages span 23 years.

840
01:18:53,254 --> 01:18:55,182
Play from the beginning.

841
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:03,377
Hey Dad,
Just checkin' in, sayin' hi.

842
01:19:04,676 --> 01:19:08,014
Umm, finished 2nd in school,

843
01:19:08,124 --> 01:19:11,722
Miss Carlin's still giving me Cs though,

844
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:15,029
pulled me down,
but second's not bad.

845
01:19:16,179 --> 01:19:18,448
Grandpa attended the ceremony.

846
01:19:20,037 --> 01:19:24,514
Umm, oh, I met another girl dad.

847
01:19:24,564 --> 01:19:29,571
I uh, I really think this is the one.

848
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:32,709
Her name is Lois.
That's her right there.

849
01:19:36,377 --> 01:19:37,996
Murphy stole grandpa's car,

850
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:41,774
She crashed it, she's okay though.

851
01:19:41,844 --> 01:19:46,630
Hey Dad.
Look at this!

852
01:19:46,710 --> 01:19:51,067
You're a grandpa!
His name's Jesse.

853
01:19:51,167 --> 01:19:56,314
I wanted to go with Coop, but
Lois says maybe next time.

854
01:19:56,444 --> 01:19:58,893
And Donald says he's already got the 'great' part so,

855
01:19:58,963 --> 01:20:01,422
we're not to call him that.

856
01:20:05,659 --> 01:20:08,537
Say goodbye to Grandpa.

857
01:20:08,647 --> 01:20:11,595
Goodbye grandpa.

858
01:20:11,675 --> 01:20:13,503
Sorry, it's been a while.

859
01:20:14,723 --> 01:20:20,790
It's..., what with Jesse and all...

860
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:29,544
Uhh, grandpa died last week.

861
01:20:29,654 --> 01:20:32,312
We buried him out in the back 40 next to mom...

862
01:20:32,312 --> 01:20:34,881
...and Jesse.

863
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:40,777
Which is where we would've buried you,
if you would've ever,... come back.

864
01:20:41,926 --> 01:20:44,224
Murph was there at the funeral.

865
01:20:45,234 --> 01:20:47,892
We don't see her that much, but she came for that.

866
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:53,819
You're not listening to this, I know.

867
01:20:56,817 --> 01:21:02,353
All these messages are just, ... drifting...

868
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:04,722
out there in the darkness.

869
01:21:04,832 --> 01:21:10,919
Lois says that, uh... I have to let you go.

870
01:21:12,107 --> 01:21:13,117
And uh...

871
01:21:14,426 --> 01:21:15,266
...so...

872
01:21:17,825 --> 01:21:21,761
I guess... I'll let you go.

873
01:21:22,811 --> 01:21:25,000
I don't know where you're dad.

874
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:28,677
But I hope that you're at peace. And...

875
01:21:28,787 --> 01:21:31,286
Goodbye.

876
01:21:43,718 --> 01:21:45,947
Hey Dad.

877
01:21:49,005 --> 01:21:51,923
Hey Murph.
-You son of a bitch!

878
01:21:55,311 --> 01:21:58,609
I never made one of these when you were still responding,

879
01:21:58,619 --> 01:22:00,488
because I was so mad at you for leaving.

880
01:22:02,886 --> 01:22:05,725
And then when you went quiet,

881
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:11,651
it felt like I should've lived with that decision,
and I have,

882
01:22:15,618 --> 01:22:18,227
but today is my birthday,

883
01:22:21,514 --> 01:22:25,262
And it's a special one,
because you told me,

884
01:22:28,191 --> 01:22:31,539
you once told me that when you come back...

885
01:22:31,649 --> 01:22:33,557
...we might be the same age.

886
01:22:35,256 --> 01:22:38,445
And today I'm the age
you were when you left.

887
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:44,701
So it would be a real good time for you to come back!

888
01:22:56,873 --> 01:22:59,342
I didn't mean to intrude,

889
01:23:00,271 --> 01:23:04,418
It's just that I've never seen you in here before.
-Because I've never been in here before.

890
01:23:06,797 --> 01:23:11,254
I talk to Amelia, all the time.
It helps.

891
01:23:11,404 --> 01:23:15,471
I'm glad you've started.
-I haven't.

892
01:23:15,581 --> 01:23:19,948
Just had something which needed to get out.
-I know they're still out there.

893
01:23:20,058 --> 01:23:20,349
I know.

894
01:23:20,469 --> 01:23:25,305
There are so many reasons why our communications
might not be getting through.

895
01:23:25,425 --> 01:23:26,605
I know Professor.

896
01:23:26,714 --> 01:23:30,752
I'm not sure, what I'm more afraid of.

897
01:23:30,862 --> 01:23:33,860
Them never coming back or...

898
01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:38,007
...coming back to find we've failed.

899
01:23:38,117 --> 01:23:41,516
Then let's succeed.
-So,

900
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:46,512
back to the fourth iteration.
Let's run it through some new fields.

901
01:23:46,623 --> 01:23:50,200
With respect Professor, we've tried that
hundreds of times.

902
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,828
-It only has to work once, Murph.

903
01:23:57,076 --> 01:24:00,484
Every rivet that they strike could've been a bullet.

904
01:24:00,564 --> 01:24:03,632
We've done well, in the world here,

905
01:24:03,732 --> 01:24:07,790
whether or not we crack the equation,
before I kick the bucket.

906
01:24:07,899 --> 01:24:11,567
Don't be morbid Professor.
-I'm not afraid of death.

907
01:24:11,677 --> 01:24:13,446
I am an old physicist.

908
01:24:15,075 --> 01:24:16,724
I'm afraid of time.

909
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,059
Time.

910
01:24:27,238 --> 01:24:29,066
You're afraid of time.

911
01:24:31,025 --> 01:24:34,083
For years we've been trying
to solve the equation without changing...

912
01:24:34,163 --> 01:24:36,752
...the underlying assumption about time.
-And?

913
01:24:36,912 --> 01:24:40,869
What it means, is each iteration
is an attempt to prove it's own proof,

914
01:24:40,949 --> 01:24:44,816
it's recursive,...it's nonsensical.

915
01:24:44,956 --> 01:24:48,654
Are you calling my life's work nonsense, Murph?

916
01:24:49,933 --> 01:24:52,981
No, I'm saying that you've been trying
to finish it with one arm...

917
01:24:52,981 --> 01:24:56,799
...no, with both arms tied behind your back.

918
01:24:58,228 --> 01:24:59,817
And I don't understand why.

919
01:25:00,927 --> 01:25:02,715
I am an old man Murph.

920
01:25:02,825 --> 01:25:06,353
Can we take this point up at another time?

921
01:25:06,463 --> 01:25:08,511
I want to talk to my daughter.

922
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:13,409
Stepping out into the universe,

923
01:25:13,519 --> 01:25:17,646
we must confront the reality of interstellar travel.

924
01:25:17,756 --> 01:25:21,884
We must reach far beyond our own lifespans.

925
01:25:23,143 --> 01:25:25,891
We must think, not as individuals,

926
01:25:26,001 --> 01:25:28,200
but as a species.

927
01:25:29,529 --> 01:25:34,516
'Do not go gentle into that good night.'

928
01:25:35,066 --> 01:25:38,164
TARS kept the Endurance right where we needed her...

929
01:25:38,244 --> 01:25:40,972
...but the trip took years longer than what we anticipated.

930
01:25:41,082 --> 01:25:43,910
We no longer have the fuel to visit both our prospects,

931
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:46,569
so, we've got to choose.

932
01:25:48,217 --> 01:25:48,797
But how?

933
01:25:50,166 --> 01:25:51,645
They're both promising.

934
01:25:52,944 --> 01:25:55,333
And Edmunds data is better,

935
01:25:55,343 --> 01:25:58,121
but Dr. Mann is the one who's still transmitting. So...

936
01:25:58,231 --> 01:26:01,039
We've got no reason to suspect Edmunds data would've soured.

937
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:06,366
His world has key elements to sustain human life.
-As does Dr. Mann's.

938
01:26:06,436 --> 01:26:07,805
Cooper, this is my field.

939
01:26:09,294 --> 01:26:13,801
And I really believe Edmund's is the better prospect.
-Why?

940
01:26:13,911 --> 01:26:18,908
Gargantua, that's why.
Look at Miller's planet.

941
01:26:19,018 --> 01:26:23,206
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes;
But no life. Sterile.

942
01:26:23,216 --> 01:26:28,063
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.
-Because of the black hole?

943
01:26:28,133 --> 01:26:31,631
-Murphy's Law.
Whatever can happen, will happen.

944
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:34,409
Accidents are the first building block of evolution,

945
01:26:34,559 --> 01:26:37,937
but when you're orbiting a black hole,
not enough can happen,

946
01:26:38,057 --> 01:26:41,915
it sucks in asteroids, comets,
other events which would otherwise reach you.

947
01:26:42,025 --> 01:26:43,304
We need to go further afield.

948
01:26:44,053 --> 01:26:49,839
You once said that Dr. Mann, was the best of us.

949
01:26:49,949 --> 01:26:53,587
He is remarkable.
we're only here because of him.

950
01:26:53,697 --> 01:26:56,975
And, and yet here he is,
he is on the ground,

951
01:26:57,115 --> 01:27:01,732
and he's sending a very unambiguous message,
telling us to come to his planet.

952
01:27:02,722 --> 01:27:07,479
-Granted.
But Edmund's data is more promising.

953
01:27:07,549 --> 01:27:11,356
-We should vote.
-Well, if we're going to vote, there's something you should know,

954
01:27:11,466 --> 01:27:14,964
Brand, he has a right to know.

955
01:27:15,044 --> 01:27:18,472
That has nothing to do with it.
-What does?

956
01:27:18,582 --> 01:27:21,730
She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.
-Is that true?

957
01:27:21,839 --> 01:27:23,059
Yes.

958
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:28,975
And that makes me want to follow my heart.

959
01:27:32,144 --> 01:27:36,181
Maybe we've spent too long trying
to figure all this out with theory,

960
01:27:36,261 --> 01:27:39,389
-You're a scientist Brand.
-So listen to me,

961
01:27:39,499 --> 01:27:44,146
When I say that love isn't
something we invented, it's...

962
01:27:44,256 --> 01:27:47,814
...observable, powerful.

963
01:27:49,722 --> 01:27:54,430
It has to mean something.
-Love has meaning, yes, social utility...

964
01:27:54,430 --> 01:27:58,017
...social bonding, child rearing,
-We love people who have died,

965
01:27:58,117 --> 01:28:02,055
where's the social utility in that?
-None.

966
01:28:02,165 --> 01:28:04,963
-Maybe it means something more,
something we can't...

967
01:28:05,033 --> 01:28:08,052
...yet understand.

968
01:28:08,122 --> 01:28:11,459
Maybe it's, some evidence, some...

969
01:28:12,339 --> 01:28:17,106
...artifact of a higher dimension...
that we can't consciously perceive,

970
01:28:17,226 --> 01:28:20,134
I'm drawn across the universe to someone...

971
01:28:20,204 --> 01:28:24,831
...I haven't seen in a decade.
Who, I know, is probably dead.

972
01:28:24,941 --> 01:28:27,959
Love is the one thing we're capable...

973
01:28:28,029 --> 01:28:31,247
...of perceiving that transcends
dimensions of time and space.

974
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:35,574
Maybe we should trust that,

975
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:38,582
even if we can't understand it yet.

976
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:44,289
Alright Cooper,

977
01:28:46,697 --> 01:28:47,637
Yes!

978
01:28:49,146 --> 01:28:52,354
The tiniest possibility of
seeing Wolf again excites me.

979
01:28:52,574 --> 01:28:57,301
But that doesn't mean I'm wrong.
-Honestly Amelia,

980
01:28:59,209 --> 01:29:00,579
it might.

981
01:29:06,295 --> 01:29:10,063
TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.

982
01:29:26,233 --> 01:29:35,327
We'll lose about a third again. Next year.
Next year, I'm gonna work Nelson's farm and I'm gonna make it up.

983
01:29:35,437 --> 01:29:37,347
What happened to Nelson?

984
01:29:43,133 --> 01:29:48,029
Murph, can I get you anything?
Would you like some more Soufflé?
-No, I'm full. Thanks.

985
01:29:48,139 --> 01:29:49,009
It was delicious.

986
01:29:50,408 --> 01:29:51,847
Hand me that donut please.

987
01:29:53,976 --> 01:29:58,413
Will you spend the night?
Your room is exactly as you left it. It's...

988
01:29:58,443 --> 01:30:01,791
-I need to get back.
-My sewing machine is in there, but there's plenty...

989
01:30:01,861 --> 01:30:04,870
-I need to...

990
01:30:06,309 --> 01:30:10,446
...too many memories.
-Well, we have something for that.

991
01:30:19,221 --> 01:30:20,320
Dust.

992
01:30:21,939 --> 01:30:25,217
Lois, I have a friend who could...

993
01:30:25,296 --> 01:30:27,486
...look at his lungs.

994
01:30:45,624 --> 01:30:48,652
Amelia, I'm sorry.
-You're just being objective.

995
01:30:48,722 --> 01:30:51,920
Unless you're punishing me,
for screwing up on Miller's planet,

996
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:54,119
-No, this wasn't a personal decision.

997
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:58,656
Well, if you're wrong, you have
a very personal decision to make.

998
01:30:58,766 --> 01:31:02,793
Your fuel calculations
are based on a return journey.

999
01:31:02,903 --> 01:31:05,841
Strike out on Mann's planet and you'll
have to decide whether...

1000
01:31:05,911 --> 01:31:09,400
...to return home, or push onto Edmunds with plan B.

1001
01:31:09,569 --> 01:31:13,367
Starting a colony could save us from extinction.

1002
01:31:13,487 --> 01:31:16,225
You might have to decide between
seeing your children again...

1003
01:31:16,335 --> 01:31:18,274
...or the future of the human race.

1004
01:31:19,423 --> 01:31:21,342
I trust you'll be as objective then.

1005
01:31:27,488 --> 01:31:30,756
He has been asking for you since he came to.

1006
01:31:30,836 --> 01:31:32,135
We were trying to reach you.

1007
01:31:37,822 --> 01:31:41,510
Murph?
-Hey.
I'm here Professor.

1008
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:44,997
I think I let all down.

1009
01:31:45,108 --> 01:31:48,176
No, you got us this far.
We're close.

1010
01:31:49,515 --> 01:31:51,743
I will finish what you started.

1011
01:31:51,863 --> 01:31:54,982
Good, good Murph.

1012
01:31:55,092 --> 01:31:59,279
You had faith.

1013
01:31:59,359 --> 01:32:04,826
All those, all those years,

1014
01:32:05,694 --> 01:32:09,822
I asked you to have faith,

1015
01:32:10,941 --> 01:32:21,965
I wanted you to believe, that your father,... would come back.

1016
01:32:22,364 --> 01:32:24,234
I do Professor.

1017
01:32:25,962 --> 01:32:29,880
Forgive me Murph.
-There's nothing to forgive.

1018
01:32:31,789 --> 01:32:36,606
I lied Murph,

1019
01:32:37,725 --> 01:32:40,034
I lied to you.

1020
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:52,706
There was no need for him, to come back.

1021
01:32:53,885 --> 01:32:59,092
There's no way to help us.

1022
01:32:59,162 --> 01:33:02,500
But the Plan A? All this?

1023
01:33:03,329 --> 01:33:07,876
All these people.
And the equation?

1024
01:33:10,844 --> 01:33:13,183
Did my father know?

1025
01:33:16,061 --> 01:33:18,680
Did he leave me?

1026
01:33:21,348 --> 01:33:31,492
'Do....not....go....gentle....'

1027
01:33:31,682 --> 01:33:37,458
No. NO!

1028
01:33:37,578 --> 01:33:41,876
You can't leave.
NO!!

1029
01:33:41,986 --> 01:33:46,083
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1030
01:33:46,183 --> 01:33:49,281
He didn't feel any pain. He was at peace.

1031
01:33:49,361 --> 01:33:52,129
I'm very sorry for your loss.

1032
01:34:04,702 --> 01:34:06,901
Brand did you know?

1033
01:34:08,420 --> 01:34:10,698
He told you right?

1034
01:34:12,296 --> 01:34:14,955
You knew?

1035
01:34:16,004 --> 01:34:18,453
This was all a sham.

1036
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:24,699
You left us here.

1037
01:34:26,038 --> 01:34:28,517
To suffocate.

1038
01:34:29,776 --> 01:34:31,605
To starve.

1039
01:34:58,599 --> 01:35:00,767
Frozen cloud.

1040
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:27,896
It's okay.

1041
01:37:33,153 --> 01:37:36,161
It's okay.

1042
01:37:36,281 --> 01:37:38,219
It's okay.

1043
01:37:41,018 --> 01:37:43,297
Pray you never learn,

1044
01:37:44,676 --> 01:37:47,654
just how good it can be to see another face.

1045
01:37:55,829 --> 01:38:01,116
I hadn't had a lot of hope to begin with.
After so long I had none.

1046
01:38:02,845 --> 01:38:05,583
My supplies were completely exhausted.

1047
01:38:07,451 --> 01:38:11,649
The last time I went to sleep,
I didn't even set up a waking date.

1048
01:38:15,407 --> 01:38:18,105
You've literally raised me from the dead.

1049
01:38:19,115 --> 01:38:20,334
Lazarus.

1050
01:38:21,494 --> 01:38:25,480
What about the others?
-I'm afraid you're it sir.

1051
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:28,409
So far, surely.

1052
01:38:28,979 --> 01:38:31,657
No. In our present situation...

1053
01:38:31,767 --> 01:38:34,465
...there's very little chance of rescuing any others.

1054
01:38:37,553 --> 01:38:38,972
Dr. Mann.

1055
01:38:39,342 --> 01:38:42,600
Dr. Mann, tell us about your world.

1056
01:38:45,798 --> 01:38:47,847
Our world, we hope...

1057
01:38:50,235 --> 01:38:59,320
Our world is cold, stark,
but undeniably beautiful.

1058
01:39:01,239 --> 01:39:04,567
The days are 67 hours long, cold.

1059
01:39:08,454 --> 01:39:12,372
The nights are 67 far colder hours.

1060
01:39:17,379 --> 01:39:23,285
The gravity is a very, very pleasant
80% of the Earth's.

1061
01:39:23,405 --> 01:39:26,573
Now here, where I landed,
the water is alkali.

1062
01:39:26,683 --> 01:39:30,381
And the air has too much ammonia in it
to breathe for more than just a few minutes.

1063
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:35,057
But, down at the surface, and there is, a surface,

1064
01:39:35,128 --> 01:39:39,705
the chlorine dissipates,
the ammonia gives way to crystalline hydrocarbons.

1065
01:39:39,815 --> 01:39:42,543
Breathable air, to organics.

1066
01:39:42,653 --> 01:39:45,392
Possibly even, to life.

1067
01:39:45,472 --> 01:39:48,310
We might be sharing this world.

1068
01:39:48,430 --> 01:39:50,709
These readings are from the surface?

1069
01:39:50,828 --> 01:39:55,535
Over the years, I've dropped various probes.
-How far have you explored?

1070
01:39:55,645 --> 01:39:58,593
I have managed several major expeditions,
but with oxygen in...

1071
01:39:58,673 --> 01:40:03,610
...limited supply, KIPP there,
really did most of the legwork.
-What went wrong with him sir?

1072
01:40:03,690 --> 01:40:06,518
Degeneration. He misidentified the first organics...

1073
01:40:06,518 --> 01:40:11,476
...we found as ammonia crystals.
We struggled on for a time, but...

1074
01:40:11,556 --> 01:40:15,443
...ultimately I decommissioned him,
used his power source to keep the mission going.

1075
01:40:15,633 --> 01:40:19,811
I thought I was alone before I even shut him down.
-Would you like me to take a look at him?

1076
01:40:19,881 --> 01:40:23,228
No, no, needs a human touch.

1077
01:40:23,298 --> 01:40:25,547
Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message...

1078
01:40:25,547 --> 01:40:29,834
...for you, from the spaceship.
-Okay, be right there. Excuse me.

1079
01:40:42,137 --> 01:40:45,414
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1080
01:40:45,524 --> 01:40:51,211
He had no pain. He was at peace.

1081
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:55,518
I'm sorry for your loss.

1082
01:40:57,897 --> 01:41:02,723
Is that Murph?
-She's,...she's grown!

1083
01:41:02,794 --> 01:41:03,803
Brand did you know?

1084
01:41:05,212 --> 01:41:06,731
He told you right?

1085
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:11,078
You knew?

1086
01:41:12,598 --> 01:41:16,856
This was all a sham.
You left us here.

1087
01:41:18,004 --> 01:41:20,662
To suffocate.

1088
01:41:22,372 --> 01:41:24,071
To starve.

1089
01:41:27,768 --> 01:41:29,328
Did my father know too?

1090
01:41:31,596 --> 01:41:32,775
Dad!

1091
01:41:35,014 --> 01:41:40,980
I just want to know, if you left me here to die?

1092
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:45,068
I just have to know!

1093
01:41:50,175 --> 01:41:58,909
Cooper, my father dedicated
his whole life to plan A, I have...

1094
01:41:58,979 --> 01:42:01,107
...no idea what she's talking about.

1095
01:42:02,187 --> 01:42:03,676
I do.

1096
01:42:08,103 --> 01:42:11,981
He, he never even hoped to get the
people off the Earth?

1097
01:42:12,061 --> 01:42:13,670
No.

1098
01:42:18,148 --> 01:42:21,955
But he has been trying to solve
the gravity equation for 40 years.

1099
01:42:22,065 --> 01:42:26,273
Amelia, your father solved his
equation before I even left.

1100
01:42:26,343 --> 01:42:28,261
Then why wouldn't he use it?

1101
01:42:28,371 --> 01:42:32,828
The equation couldn't reconcile
relativity with quantum mechanics
You need more.

1102
01:42:32,908 --> 01:42:37,526
More? More what?
-More data. You need to see into a black hole.

1103
01:42:37,526 --> 01:42:41,663
The laws of nature prohibit a naked singularity.
-Romilly, is that true?

1104
01:42:42,502 --> 01:42:46,739
If the black hole is an oyster, then
the singularity is the pearl inside.

1105
01:42:46,909 --> 01:42:49,158
The gravity is so strong that it is always hidden...

1106
01:42:49,228 --> 01:42:50,987
...in darkness, beyond the horizon.

1107
01:42:52,076 --> 01:42:54,305
That's why we call it a 'black' hole.

1108
01:42:54,415 --> 01:42:58,643
Okay,...what if we see beyond the horizon?

1109
01:42:58,713 --> 01:43:02,800
We can't Cooper.
-There are some things that aren't meant to be known.

1110
01:43:02,910 --> 01:43:07,327
Your father had to find another way to save
the human race from extinction.

1111
01:43:07,377 --> 01:43:10,895
Plan B, a colony.
-But why not tell people?

1112
01:43:12,344 --> 01:43:13,723
Why keep it from us?

1113
01:43:13,833 --> 01:43:16,211
Because he knew how hard it would be
to get people...

1114
01:43:16,211 --> 01:43:21,208
...to work together to save the species
instead of themselves. Or their children.

1115
01:43:21,308 --> 01:43:22,398
Bullshit!

1116
01:43:22,498 --> 01:43:25,246
You never would have come here unless
you believed you were gonna save them.

1117
01:43:25,356 --> 01:43:28,114
Evolution has yet to
transcend that simple barrier.

1118
01:43:28,194 --> 01:43:32,402
We can care deeply, selflessly
about those we know.

1119
01:43:32,471 --> 01:43:36,829
But that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight.
-But the lie?

1120
01:43:40,177 --> 01:43:44,744
That monstrous lie?
-Unforgivable.

1121
01:43:44,864 --> 01:43:49,641
And he knew that.
He was prepared to destroy his own humanity,

1122
01:43:49,761 --> 01:43:53,249
in order to save the species,
he made an incredible sacrifice.

1123
01:43:53,359 --> 01:43:57,856
NO! No, an incredible sacrifice is being made,

1124
01:43:57,925 --> 01:44:00,825
by the people on Earth who're gonna die!

1125
01:44:00,835 --> 01:44:05,481
Because in his fucking arrogance,
he declared their case hopeless.

1126
01:44:05,581 --> 01:44:10,038
I'm sorry Cooper,
their case is hopeless.

1127
01:44:10,078 --> 01:44:14,306
No. No.
-We are the future.

1128
01:44:15,745 --> 01:44:16,964
Cooper.

1129
01:44:18,094 --> 01:44:19,642
Cooper, what I can do?

1130
01:44:22,521 --> 01:44:24,389
Let me go home.

1131
01:44:24,899 --> 01:44:27,558
You're absolutely positive?

1132
01:44:27,678 --> 01:44:32,175
His solution was correct. He's had it for years.
-It's worthless?

1133
01:44:32,245 --> 01:44:33,873
It's half the answer.

1134
01:44:34,464 --> 01:44:38,011
Okay, how do you find the other half?

1135
01:44:38,121 --> 01:44:41,260
Out there, in a black hole.
But stuck down on Earth?

1136
01:44:41,369 --> 01:44:42,878
Yeah?

1137
01:44:44,108 --> 01:44:45,617
I'm not sure you can.

1138
01:44:46,556 --> 01:44:50,453
God, they just pack up and leave.

1139
01:44:52,072 --> 01:44:55,840
What're they hoping to find?
-Survival.

1140
01:45:03,085 --> 01:45:04,415
Damn it!

1141
01:45:07,483 --> 01:45:11,320
Murph, don't, don't people have the right to know?

1142
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:15,867
Panic won't help.
We just have to keep working, same as ever.

1143
01:45:15,938 --> 01:45:19,156
Yes, but isn't that exactly what
Professor Brand was manipulating...

1144
01:45:19,256 --> 01:45:22,573
-Brand gave up on us.
I'm still trying to solve this.

1145
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:27,091
So, do you have an idea?

1146
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:29,749
A feeling.

1147
01:45:32,267 --> 01:45:34,686
I told you about my ghost.

1148
01:45:36,245 --> 01:45:40,792
My dad thought I called it a ghost
because I was scared of it.

1149
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:46,329
But I was never scared of it.

1150
01:45:47,298 --> 01:45:55,034
I called it a ghost because
it felt....like a person,

1151
01:45:56,793 --> 01:45:59,641
that was trying to tell me something.

1152
01:46:01,810 --> 01:46:05,008
If there is an answer
here on Earth, it's back there,

1153
01:46:05,078 --> 01:46:09,325
somehow in that room.
So I have to find it.

1154
01:46:12,712 --> 01:46:14,792
We're running out of time.

1155
01:46:15,841 --> 01:46:18,969
What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?

1156
01:46:19,079 --> 01:46:22,737
They can stay CASE.
I'll be sleeping most of the way anyway.
-Hey Coop. -Yeah?

1157
01:46:22,847 --> 01:46:26,284
I had a suggestion for your return journey.
-What is that?

1158
01:46:26,394 --> 01:46:28,264
Have one last crack at the black hole.

1159
01:46:29,572 --> 01:46:33,070
I'm going home Rom.
-Yeah I know.

1160
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:37,837
This isn't gonna cost you any time.
It's a chance for the people on Earth.

1161
01:46:37,917 --> 01:46:41,675
Talk to me.
-Gargantua is an older spinning black hole.

1162
01:46:41,785 --> 01:46:45,003
It is what we call a 'gentle' singularity.
-Gentle?

1163
01:46:45,123 --> 01:46:49,510
They're hardly gentle.
But the tidal gravity is so quick that something...

1164
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:53,897
...crossing the horizon fast, might survive.
A probe say.

1165
01:46:53,967 --> 01:46:55,446
What happens after it crosses?

1166
01:46:55,526 --> 01:46:58,404
After, the horizon,
is a complete mystery.

1167
01:46:58,484 --> 01:47:01,273
So, what's to say that there isn't some
way that the probe can...

1168
01:47:01,273 --> 01:47:04,201
...glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

1169
01:47:04,331 --> 01:47:08,348
If he's equipped to transmit every form of energy that can pulse...

1170
01:47:08,438 --> 01:47:13,286
Just when did this probe become a 'he' professor?
-TARS is the obvious candidate.

1171
01:47:13,405 --> 01:47:16,004
I've already told him what to look for.

1172
01:47:16,124 --> 01:47:20,331
I'll need the old optical transmitter on KIPP, Cooper.
-You would do this for us?

1173
01:47:20,441 --> 01:47:23,279
Before you get all teary,
try to remember that as a robot...

1174
01:47:23,349 --> 01:47:26,967
...I have to do anything you say.
-Your cue light's blinking.

1175
01:47:27,037 --> 01:47:28,456
I'm not joking!

1176
01:47:30,075 --> 01:47:34,792
I'm gonna need TARS to remove and adapt
some components from KIPP.

1177
01:47:34,862 --> 01:47:38,450
Well, I don't wanna disturb his archival functions.
-I'll supervise.

1178
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:42,737
Alright.
-Dr. Mann, we need to find 3 secure sites.

1179
01:47:42,817 --> 01:47:45,076
One for Brand's lab and 2 for habitat.

1180
01:47:45,186 --> 01:47:47,735
Once those modules have landed,
you don't wanna move.

1181
01:47:47,834 --> 01:47:49,993
Well I can take you to the probes sites,
but I don't think this...

1182
01:47:50,102 --> 01:47:53,021
...these conditions are gonna hold.
I think we should wait.

1183
01:47:53,131 --> 01:47:56,010
CASE is headed back down with the
rest of the distillery equipment.

1184
01:47:56,089 --> 01:47:58,678
I would really like to secure those sites by nightfall.

1185
01:48:00,237 --> 01:48:04,185
Well, these squalls do usually blow over.

1186
01:48:04,265 --> 01:48:07,352
Okay then.
-You're gonna have to take a long-range transmitter.

1187
01:48:07,472 --> 01:48:09,241
Right.
-Are you charged? -Yeah.

1188
01:48:09,331 --> 01:48:10,740
Follow me.

1189
01:48:10,850 --> 01:48:15,547
TARS, 72 hours yeah? -Roger that Cooper.

1190
01:48:21,713 --> 01:48:24,771
Brand told me why you feel you've got to go back.

1191
01:48:25,581 --> 01:48:30,358
But I'd be remiss
if didn't at least mention that a mission...

1192
01:48:30,428 --> 01:48:33,596
...such as ours could certainly do
with an extra engineer.

1193
01:48:35,055 --> 01:48:37,393
Oh you better slow down turbo.

1194
01:48:37,503 --> 01:48:42,441
Safety first CASE, do not forget.
-Safety first Cooper.

1195
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:46,977
I have to tell you Dr. Mann
I'm honored to be a part of this.

1196
01:48:47,087 --> 01:48:49,246
But once we set up
base camp and...

1197
01:48:49,366 --> 01:48:53,713
...secure those modules, my work is done here.
I'm going home.

1198
01:49:01,539 --> 01:49:03,268
We have attachments.

1199
01:49:03,348 --> 01:49:07,625
But even without a family,
I can, promise you that, that yearning...

1200
01:49:07,735 --> 01:49:10,213
...to be with other people is remarkable.

1201
01:49:10,243 --> 01:49:16,289
That emotion is, at the foundation, of what makes us human.

1202
01:49:24,965 --> 01:49:28,622
How long have you had that cough?
-For a while.

1203
01:49:38,546 --> 01:49:40,845
Mom let's me play in here.

1204
01:49:41,384 --> 01:49:43,723
I don't touch your stuff.

1205
01:50:14,174 --> 01:50:16,403
Just take this gently.

1206
01:50:21,829 --> 01:50:25,277
You know why we couldn't just send
machines on these missions, don't you Cooper?

1207
01:50:25,397 --> 01:50:30,364
A machine doesn't improvise well,
because you can't programme the fear of death.

1208
01:50:30,444 --> 01:50:35,001
Our survival instinct is
our single greatest source of inspiration.

1209
01:50:35,111 --> 01:50:37,099
Take you for example,

1210
01:50:37,999 --> 01:50:43,146
A father, with a survival instinct
that extends to your kids.

1211
01:50:43,276 --> 01:50:48,613
What does research tell us, is the
last thing you're gonna see, before you die?

1212
01:50:50,052 --> 01:50:53,440
Your children.
Their faces.

1213
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:57,617
At the moment of death, your mind
is going to push you a little bit harder, to survive.

1214
01:50:57,697 --> 01:51:01,285
For them.

1215
01:51:03,373 --> 01:51:07,391
Hey, I bet you're Coop.
Why don't you have a seat here for me.

1216
01:51:07,521 --> 01:51:09,960
It's bad.
They cannot stay here.

1217
01:51:10,319 --> 01:51:12,099
OK? -Yes.

1218
01:51:19,863 --> 01:51:24,511
TARS, what's taking so long?
-Professor, I'm having trouble completing the boot-up.

1219
01:51:24,621 --> 01:51:26,410
I don't understand?

1220
01:51:33,186 --> 01:51:34,375
It's funny.

1221
01:51:36,343 --> 01:51:41,411
When I left Earth,
I thought I was prepared to die.

1222
01:51:42,379 --> 01:51:49,656
The truth is, I never really, considered...

1223
01:51:49,765 --> 01:51:52,063
...the possibility that my planet wasn't the one.

1224
01:51:54,173 --> 01:51:58,260
Nothing turns out the way it's supposed to be.
-Let's go.

1225
01:52:03,917 --> 01:52:06,495
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!

1226
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:16,808
What is this?
-What are you doing??

1227
01:52:16,928 --> 01:52:20,277
I'm sorry, I can't let you leave
with that ship.

1228
01:52:20,357 --> 01:52:23,015
We're going to need it
to complete the mission.

1229
01:52:23,125 --> 01:52:28,111
Once the others, realize what this place isn't.
We cannot survive here.

1230
01:52:28,191 --> 01:52:30,580
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1231
01:52:40,564 --> 01:52:41,873
They can't stay here anymore.

1232
01:52:41,953 --> 01:52:45,571
You have to leave, right now.
Hey buddy, let me make something abundantly clear...

1233
01:52:45,651 --> 01:52:48,409
You have a responsibility.
-Shit.

1234
01:52:48,519 --> 01:52:51,117
Coop, get her stuff, she's goin' home.

1235
01:52:51,227 --> 01:52:53,296
-Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb Tom!

1236
01:52:53,375 --> 01:52:55,664
Dad didn't raise me, grandpa did,
and he's buried...

1237
01:52:55,674 --> 01:52:57,183
...out back with mom and Jesse.

1238
01:52:57,213 --> 01:53:06,668
All the data?

1239
01:53:08,736 --> 01:53:13,564
No. I tried to do my duty Cooper.

1240
01:53:13,673 --> 01:53:18,490
But I knew, the day that I arrived here,
this place had nothing...

1241
01:53:18,561 --> 01:53:22,838
...and I resisted the temptation, for years

1242
01:53:22,918 --> 01:53:30,872
But, I knew that, if I just pressed
that button, then, somebody would come and save me.

1243
01:53:31,992 --> 01:53:35,370
You fucking coward!
-Yes.

1244
01:53:40,347 --> 01:53:41,746
Yes.

1245
01:53:43,125 --> 01:53:44,664
Yes.

1246
01:53:45,674 --> 01:53:46,603
Yes.

1247
01:53:58,466 --> 01:54:03,213
Listen, if you're not gonna go, let your family go.
Just let,...save your family.

1248
01:54:03,243 --> 01:54:08,100
And go to live underground? With you?
Pray that daddy comes to save us?

1249
01:54:08,170 --> 01:54:12,087
Dad's not coming back. He never was coming back.
It's upto me!

1250
01:54:12,137 --> 01:54:16,995
Are you going to save everybody?
Because dad couldn't do it?. -DAD DIDN'T EVEN TRY!!

1251
01:54:17,115 --> 01:54:18,813
Dad just abandoned us!!

1252
01:54:20,003 --> 01:54:24,250
He left us here to die.
-Nobody is going with you.

1253
01:54:28,128 --> 01:54:30,336
You're gonna wait for your next kid to die?

1254
01:54:33,364 --> 01:54:37,252
Get out, and don't come back!

1255
01:54:42,019 --> 01:54:43,858
Do what you want with those things.

1256
01:54:54,532 --> 01:54:56,240
Stop it!

1257
01:54:58,009 --> 01:55:00,558
No. NO!

1258
01:55:01,487 --> 01:55:04,835
Dr. Mann there's a 50-50 chance that you're gonna kill yourselves.

1259
01:55:04,915 --> 01:55:07,643
Those are the best odds I've had in years!

1260
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:32,518
Don't judge me Cooper.
You were never tested like I was.

1261
01:55:32,957 --> 01:55:34,887
Few men have been.

1262
01:55:43,172 --> 01:55:44,870
You tried your best Murph.

1263
01:55:53,665 --> 01:55:55,583
Do you feel it?

1264
01:55:56,593 --> 01:55:58,892
The survival instinct.

1265
01:55:59,791 --> 01:56:04,468
That's what drove me.
It's what drives all of us, and it's what's gonna save us.

1266
01:56:04,538 --> 01:56:08,296
Because I want to save all of us.
For you Cooper.

1267
01:56:13,412 --> 01:56:17,420
I'm sorry, I can't,
I can't watch you go through this. I'm sorry.

1268
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:19,769
I thought I could, but I can't.

1269
01:56:21,028 --> 01:56:23,497
I'm here, I'm here for you.

1270
01:56:23,607 --> 01:56:27,394
Just listen to my voice Cooper, I'm right here.

1271
01:56:28,513 --> 01:56:31,142
You're not alone.

1272
01:56:40,036 --> 01:56:42,475
Do you see your children?

1273
01:56:44,963 --> 01:56:49,091
It's okay.
They are right there with you.

1274
01:56:52,949 --> 01:56:56,226
Did Professor Brand tell you that poem
before you left?

1275
01:56:56,336 --> 01:56:58,025
Do you remember?

1276
01:56:59,254 --> 01:57:03,721
'Do not go gentle,
into that good night'

1277
01:57:03,832 --> 01:57:09,538
'Old age should burn, and rave
at close of day.'

1278
01:57:10,888 --> 01:57:14,235
'Rage, rage against the
dying of the light.'

1279
01:57:38,631 --> 01:57:41,519
Help! Help!
-Cooper?

1280
01:57:48,435 --> 01:57:51,253
CASE!
-Brand.

1281
01:57:52,201 --> 01:57:53,081
No air!

1282
01:57:55,110 --> 01:57:58,558
Cooper. Cooper I'm coming.
CASE! -I have a fix.

1283
01:57:58,638 --> 01:58:00,977
Go, go, go!!

1284
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:15,547
Cooper we're coming, hang in there, don't talk!

1285
01:58:15,627 --> 01:58:18,136
Breathe as little as possible. We're almost there!

1286
01:58:21,144 --> 01:58:23,613
There is a security lockout sir, it requires...

1287
01:58:23,692 --> 01:58:26,381
...a person to access the functions.

1288
01:58:30,898 --> 01:58:34,145
It's all yours sir.

1289
01:58:50,516 --> 01:58:51,435
Cooper!!

1290
01:58:55,133 --> 01:58:57,511
Come on!

1291
01:59:03,728 --> 01:59:08,155
I see him! I see him!
To the right. Bank right!

1292
01:59:26,174 --> 01:59:29,432
Cooper!
Cooper, I'm here.

1293
01:59:34,978 --> 01:59:35,998
Take this!

1294
01:59:43,833 --> 01:59:45,522
Joey bring the tankers!

1295
01:59:52,097 --> 01:59:54,436
This data makes no sense.

1296
02:00:02,052 --> 02:00:05,579
I'm sorry.
-What?

1297
02:00:05,699 --> 02:00:07,539
Mann, was lying!

1298
02:00:17,313 --> 02:00:20,221
Romilly!

1299
02:00:20,331 --> 02:00:23,618
Romilly, do you read me?
Romilly!!

1300
02:00:23,728 --> 02:00:25,498
STEP BACK PROFESSOR!! STEP BACK!!

1301
02:00:32,863 --> 02:00:36,131
Romilly. -Romilly! Do you read me?!!

1302
02:00:38,489 --> 02:00:40,108
Keep watch!

1303
02:00:41,258 --> 02:00:44,875
Lois!
-What happened to caution CASE?

1304
02:00:44,955 --> 02:00:46,324
Safety first Cooper.

1305
02:00:46,395 --> 02:00:50,142
Romilly, Romilly do you read me? This is Brand.

1306
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:56,958
Romilly!
-Dr. Brand, Cooper, there's been an explosion.

1307
02:00:57,068 --> 02:00:58,997
Dr. Mann's compound.

1308
02:01:27,060 --> 02:01:28,818
TARS, TARS! 10 o'clock.

1309
02:01:35,295 --> 02:01:37,253
Tell me when TARS is aboard.

1310
02:01:40,821 --> 02:01:42,580
Romilly did not survive.

1311
02:01:43,809 --> 02:01:47,687
I could not save him.
-TARS is in. -I'll take it from here!

1312
02:01:47,797 --> 02:01:50,185
D'you have a fix on the Ranger?
-He is pushing into orbit.

1313
02:01:50,295 --> 02:01:53,513
Ah, if he takes control
of that ship we're dead.

1314
02:01:54,743 --> 02:01:57,990
He'd maroon us?
-He is marooning us!

1315
02:01:59,320 --> 02:02:02,908
Get downstairs. Go wait by the car.

1316
02:02:09,623 --> 02:02:13,501
Come on.
Get in the back!

1317
02:02:13,570 --> 02:02:14,580
Get in the back seat, now!!

1318
02:02:19,757 --> 02:02:24,444
Dr. Mann please respond!
Dr. Mann please respond!!

1319
02:02:24,554 --> 02:02:28,551
He doesn't know the Endurance's docking procedure.
-But the autopilot does.

1320
02:02:28,661 --> 02:02:32,439
Not since TARS disabled it!
-Nice!

1321
02:02:32,509 --> 02:02:35,317
What is your trust setting TARS?
-Lower than yours apparently!

1322
02:02:40,164 --> 02:02:43,233
Do not attempt docking, I repeat do not attempt docking.

1323
02:03:42,546 --> 02:03:45,284
Auto docking sequence withheld.

1324
02:03:45,314 --> 02:03:49,631
Override. -Unauthorized.
-Override!

1325
02:03:49,701 --> 02:03:51,830
Unauthorized.

1326
02:03:56,237 --> 02:04:00,874
Do not attempt docking, I repeat Do Not! attempt docking! Please resp...

1327
02:04:44,388 --> 02:04:46,297
Moving slowly towards the Endurance.

1328
02:05:10,571 --> 02:05:14,909
Imperfect contact.
-Override! -Hatch locked.

1329
02:05:22,344 --> 02:05:24,753
Has he locked on yet? -Imperfectly.

1330
02:05:26,791 --> 02:05:28,470
Dr. Mann...

1331
02:05:49,118 --> 02:05:52,066
Hatch lockout disengaged.

1332
02:06:00,981 --> 02:06:04,869
Dr. Mann, do not, I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1333
02:06:04,939 --> 02:06:09,705
I repeat, do not open the hatch.
If you open the hatch, the airlock will depressurize.

1334
02:06:35,139 --> 02:06:38,147
What happens if he blows the airlock?
-Nothing good.

1335
02:06:43,905 --> 02:06:48,182
Okay, pull back, pull back. Retro thrusters full
move back CASE! -Maximum. -Back!

1336
02:06:48,441 --> 02:06:51,210
CASE relay my message
to the onboard computer...

1337
02:06:51,320 --> 02:06:52,819
...and have it rebroadcast
as emergency PA.

1338
02:06:52,859 --> 02:06:58,735
Dr. Mann, do not open the air hatch.

1339
02:06:58,845 --> 02:07:01,143
I repeat, do not... -Brand?

1340
02:07:01,223 --> 02:07:06,191
I don't know what he said to you?
But I'm taking command of the Endurance.

1341
02:07:06,261 --> 02:07:09,039
And then we're gonna talk about completing the mission.

1342
02:07:11,557 --> 02:07:14,395
Dr. Mann, listen to me!

1343
02:07:14,476 --> 02:07:18,353
This is not about my life, or Cooper's life,

1344
02:07:18,462 --> 02:07:20,232
This is about all mankind.

1345
02:07:21,321 --> 02:07:22,350
There is a moment...

1346
02:07:29,116 --> 02:07:30,156
It is not...

1347
02:07:38,281 --> 02:07:39,970
Oh, my God.

1348
02:07:57,869 --> 02:08:03,605
Cooper there's no point in using your fuel...
-Analyze the Endurance's spin.

1349
02:08:07,683 --> 02:08:10,491
-Cooper, what are you doing?
-Docking.

1350
02:08:13,359 --> 02:08:16,537
Computer says rotation at 67, 68 rpm.

1351
02:08:16,607 --> 02:08:20,744
Get ready to match our spin with the retro thrusters.
-It's not possible.

1352
02:08:20,824 --> 02:08:22,873
-No, it's necessary.

1353
02:08:33,947 --> 02:08:36,645
The Endurance is entering the atmosphere.

1354
02:08:40,862 --> 02:08:42,491
It does not have a heat shield.

1355
02:08:44,940 --> 02:08:47,598
CASE, you ready?
-Ready.

1356
02:08:55,953 --> 02:08:58,771
Cooper, this is no time for caution.

1357
02:09:00,540 --> 02:09:02,558
CASE, if I pass out, you take the stick.

1358
02:09:02,668 --> 02:09:06,157
TARS, get ready to engage
the docking mechanism.

1359
02:09:12,542 --> 02:09:15,980
The Endurance is starting to heat.
-20 feet out.

1360
02:09:16,060 --> 02:09:19,908
I need three degrees starboard Cooper.
-10 feet out.

1361
02:09:20,008 --> 02:09:23,545
Cooper, we are, lined up!

1362
02:09:23,655 --> 02:09:25,054
Initiate spin!

1363
02:10:06,929 --> 02:10:08,218
Hold on TARS!

1364
02:10:16,023 --> 02:10:17,323
HOLD ON!

1365
02:10:27,777 --> 02:10:31,244
We're locked Cooper. -EASING UP!

1366
02:10:38,479 --> 02:10:40,578
Slowly.

1367
02:10:41,607 --> 02:10:42,856
Slowly.

1368
02:10:48,123 --> 02:10:50,073
Retro thrusters!

1369
02:10:57,568 --> 02:10:59,847
Main engines on!

1370
02:11:04,963 --> 02:11:08,441
We're getting out of orbit. Come on baby!

1371
02:11:16,016 --> 02:11:17,635
Shutting engines.

1372
02:11:18,715 --> 02:11:20,704
Okay we're out of orbit!

1373
02:11:28,259 --> 02:11:31,497
Okay! And for our next trick!

1374
02:11:32,436 --> 02:11:36,584
It better be good.
We're headed into Gargantua's pull.

1375
02:11:37,553 --> 02:11:41,091
Shit. CASE take the stick.
-Roger that.

1376
02:12:30,191 --> 02:12:33,099
Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.

1377
02:12:33,249 --> 02:12:35,768
Shall I use the engines?

1378
02:12:35,878 --> 02:12:40,185
No, we gotta let her slide as far as we can!

1379
02:12:49,438 --> 02:12:52,267
Give it to me.
-It's good news and bad news Cooper.

1380
02:12:52,377 --> 02:12:56,264
Yeah, to hell with it TARS!
Just give it to me straight.

1381
02:13:03,890 --> 02:13:07,928
The back-up generator kicked in,
so the system's stable. They're all good.

1382
02:13:09,097 --> 02:13:13,315
Good! Okay.
The navigational hub's been completely destroyed.

1383
02:13:13,414 --> 02:13:16,033
We don't have enough life support to make it back to Earth,

1384
02:13:16,113 --> 02:13:20,040
but I think we can scratch over to Edmund's planet.
-What about fuel?

1385
02:13:20,149 --> 02:13:22,858
It's not enough.
But I have a plan.

1386
02:13:22,898 --> 02:13:26,406
We let, Gargantua, pull us down close...

1387
02:13:26,406 --> 02:13:29,534
to the horizon, and a powered slingshot...

1388
02:13:29,654 --> 02:13:32,312
...around launching us towards Edmund's planet.
-Manually?

1389
02:13:32,422 --> 02:13:36,090
That's what I'm here for.
I'll take us just inside the critical orbit.

1390
02:13:36,160 --> 02:13:37,669
What about the time slippage?

1391
02:13:37,779 --> 02:13:41,277
Neither one of us have time
to worry about relativity right now Dr. Brand.

1392
02:13:45,874 --> 02:13:46,864
Sorry Cooper.

1393
02:13:49,102 --> 02:13:52,130
Once we have gathered enough speed...

1394
02:13:52,201 --> 02:13:55,249
...around Gargantua,
we use Lander 1,

1395
02:13:55,748 --> 02:13:58,386
and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters...

1396
02:13:58,636 --> 02:14:01,304
...to push us out of the black hole's gravity

1397
02:14:02,853 --> 02:14:05,692
The Lander's linkages have been destroyed,

1398
02:14:05,772 --> 02:14:08,760
so we're going to have
to control it manually.

1399
02:14:10,229 --> 02:14:13,507
Once Lander 1 is spent,
TARS will detach...

1400
02:14:13,617 --> 02:14:17,834
...and get sucked right into that black hole!
-Why does TARS have to detach?

1401
02:14:17,944 --> 02:14:22,431
We have to shed the weight, escape gravity.
-Newton's third law.

1402
02:14:22,501 --> 02:14:26,379
The only way humans have figured out of getting somewhere
is to leave something behind.

1403
02:14:26,529 --> 02:14:31,436
Cooper, you can't ask TARS to do this for us.
-He's a robot...

1404
02:14:31,546 --> 02:14:35,644
...so you don't have to ask him to do anything.
-Cooper, you asshole!

1405
02:14:35,714 --> 02:14:40,091
Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.
-It's what we intended Dr. Brand.

1406
02:14:40,101 --> 02:14:43,049
It's our only chance to save people on Earth,

1407
02:14:43,129 --> 02:14:47,886
if I can find a way to transmit the quantum data I'll find in there,
maybe they'll make it.

1408
02:14:49,475 --> 02:14:51,813
Let's just hope there is still someone there to save.

1409
02:15:20,346 --> 02:15:22,204
Maximum velocity achieved.

1410
02:15:22,274 --> 02:15:27,112
Prepare to fire speed thrusters.

1411
02:15:27,182 --> 02:15:29,720
Ready?
-Ready. -Ready.

1412
02:15:29,810 --> 02:15:36,016
Main engine ignition in 3, 2, 1...

1413
02:15:51,696 --> 02:15:53,795
Engines of Lander 1 on my command,

1414
02:15:54,705 --> 02:15:59,641
3, 2, 1...

1415
02:16:03,909 --> 02:16:07,037
Engines of Ranger 2 on my command,

1416
02:16:07,107 --> 02:16:11,664
3, 2, 1...

1417
02:16:20,878 --> 02:16:24,836
This little maneuver is gonna cost us 51 years!!

1418
02:16:24,916 --> 02:16:28,224
You're not too bad for someone pushing 120!

1419
02:16:43,335 --> 02:16:46,503
Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark,

1420
02:16:46,613 --> 02:16:52,429
3, 2, 1...

1421
02:16:52,509 --> 02:16:53,558
Detach!

1422
02:16:56,457 --> 02:17:01,024
Goodbye TARS!
-Goodbye Dr. Brand. See you on the other side Coop.

1423
02:17:01,103 --> 02:17:02,443
See you there slick!

1424
02:17:10,977 --> 02:17:14,426
Okay CASE. Nice reckless flying!

1425
02:17:14,535 --> 02:17:17,004
Learned from the master!

1426
02:17:17,084 --> 02:17:19,593
Ranger 2, prepare for detachment.

1427
02:17:19,673 --> 02:17:23,350
-What, no, no! Cooper, Cooper,
what are you doing??

1428
02:17:23,460 --> 02:17:26,728
Newton's third law.
You gotta leave something behind!

1429
02:17:27,088 --> 02:17:31,495
You said we had enough resources for both of us!
-We agreed Amelia,

1430
02:17:31,535 --> 02:17:34,063
90%

1431
02:17:34,173 --> 02:17:36,342
No!

1432
02:17:37,612 --> 02:17:39,790
Detach.

1433
02:17:53,162 --> 02:17:55,580
Okay, we're nosing down.

1434
02:17:59,058 --> 02:18:01,297
Approaching the event horizon.

1435
02:18:02,485 --> 02:18:14,578
Portside, dipping down beneath it..., to go through it.
Heading towards... blackness... <i></i>

1436
02:18:14,808 --> 02:18:16,677
It's all black!

1437
02:18:19,015 --> 02:18:23,093
TARS, do you read me? It's all black.

1438
02:18:23,893 --> 02:18:26,751
TARS, do you read me? Over.

1439
02:18:31,368 --> 02:18:37,694
We're...we're getting screens,
We're getting interference.

1440
02:18:39,533 --> 02:18:40,792
Losing control of the stick.

1441
02:18:40,902 --> 02:18:44,820
We've got flashes.
Flashes of lightness and blackness.

1442
02:18:44,890 --> 02:18:49,597
There's a turbulence in the gravity.

1443
02:18:54,274 --> 02:18:57,192
Computers going down.

1444
02:19:08,825 --> 02:19:12,053
The gravitational pull, we're losing control of the stick.

1445
02:19:45,043 --> 02:19:47,202
Murph! Murph, come on!

1446
02:21:53,983 --> 02:21:55,063
Murph!

1447
02:22:05,466 --> 02:22:07,595
Murph! Murph!! Murphhh!!

1448
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:16,529
Murph!!

1449
02:22:23,944 --> 02:22:27,143
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Murphhhhhhhhh!!!!!

1450
02:22:27,223 --> 02:22:28,622
Murphhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!

1451
02:22:29,632 --> 02:22:30,750
No, no!!!!!!!

1452
02:23:29,914 --> 02:23:33,872
If you're leaving just go!
-No.

1453
02:23:34,841 --> 02:23:38,599
No, don't go. Don't go you idiot!
Don't go!!!

1454
02:23:40,977 --> 02:23:47,413
Morse, Morse, Morse.

1455
02:23:47,534 --> 02:23:48,273
'S'

1456
02:23:54,499 --> 02:23:55,248
'T'

1457
02:23:58,526 --> 02:24:00,985
'A'

1458
02:24:01,825 --> 02:24:03,004
'-'

1459
02:24:04,883 --> 02:24:07,171
'-'

1460
02:24:07,970 --> 02:24:11,818
Murph, we don't have time for this, come on!

1461
02:24:17,714 --> 02:24:18,814
STAY!!!

1462
02:24:29,077 --> 02:24:39,671
Come on, come on, Murph, Murph, come on!
What's it say? What's it say? What's it say?

1463
02:24:46,866 --> 02:24:47,836
It say's STAY!

1464
02:25:23,505 --> 02:25:26,253
Tell him Murph. Make him stay.

1465
02:25:28,631 --> 02:25:31,429
Make him, make him stay Murph.

1466
02:25:35,716 --> 02:25:37,255
STAY

1467
02:25:40,014 --> 02:25:41,953
Make him stay Murph!

1468
02:25:43,182 --> 02:25:45,761
Don't let me leave Murph!!!

1469
02:25:48,478 --> 02:25:51,807
Don't, DON'T LET ME LEAVE MURPH!!!

1470
02:25:56,613 --> 02:25:59,072
NO, NO, NO, NOOO!!!.

1471
02:26:20,069 --> 02:26:21,758
It was you!!

1472
02:26:32,931 --> 02:26:35,410
You were my ghost!!

1473
02:26:47,013 --> 02:26:50,770
Cooper, Cooper come in.
-TARS??

1474
02:26:50,920 --> 02:26:52,359
Roger that.

1475
02:26:53,728 --> 02:26:56,917
You survived?
-Somewhere...

1476
02:26:57,037 --> 02:27:01,244
...in their fifth dimension.
They saved us!

1477
02:27:01,364 --> 02:27:04,881
Yeah? Well who the hell is 'They'?

1478
02:27:04,992 --> 02:27:07,120
And just why would they want to help us?

1479
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:10,278
I don't know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space...

1480
02:27:10,288 --> 02:27:15,016
...inside their five dimensional
reality to allow you to understand it.
-Yeah well it ain't working.

1481
02:27:15,096 --> 02:27:21,201
Yes it is. You've seen that time,
is represented as a physical dimension.

1482
02:27:21,321 --> 02:27:25,879
You've worked out that you can exert a force
across spacetime.
-Gravity...

1483
02:27:26,918 --> 02:27:29,536
...to send a message?
-Affirmative.

1484
02:27:31,476 --> 02:27:33,444
Gravity...

1485
02:27:33,564 --> 02:27:38,021
...can cross the dimensions, including time?

1486
02:27:38,291 --> 02:27:39,550
-Apparently.

1487
02:27:43,338 --> 02:27:47,256
Do you have the quantum data?
-Roger, I have it.

1488
02:27:47,365 --> 02:27:50,703
I've translated it on all wavelengths...

1489
02:27:50,703 --> 02:27:54,860
...but nothing is getting out Cooper.
-I can do this, I can.

1490
02:27:54,910 --> 02:27:59,538
But such complicated data to a child?
-Not just any child.

1491
02:28:01,377 --> 02:28:03,205
Come on dad!

1492
02:28:06,314 --> 02:28:08,003
Murph, the fire's out! Come on!

1493
02:28:08,073 --> 02:28:11,761
Even though you communicate it here,
she won't understand it's significance for years!

1494
02:28:11,931 --> 02:28:16,797
No, no, I get that TARS, but
we've got to figure something out alright...

1495
02:28:16,907 --> 02:28:19,536
...or the people on Earth are gonna die!
Think, think, think!

1496
02:28:19,805 --> 02:28:23,413
Cooper, they didn't bring
us here to change the past.

1497
02:28:27,071 --> 02:28:31,968
Say that again.
-They didn't bring us here, to change the past.

1498
02:28:36,175 --> 02:28:38,984
No, they didn't bring us here at all.

1499
02:28:44,111 --> 02:28:45,059
We brought ourselves!

1500
02:28:54,214 --> 02:28:58,621
TARS, give me the coordinates for NASA, in binary.

1501
02:28:58,751 --> 02:29:01,080
In binary, roger, translating data.

1502
02:29:24,765 --> 02:29:27,534
It's not a ghost.

1503
02:29:28,473 --> 02:29:32,980
It's gravity.
-Don't you get it yet TARS?

1504
02:29:33,090 --> 02:29:34,929
I brought myself here!

1505
02:29:35,429 --> 02:29:39,377
We're here to communicate,
with the three dimensional world!

1506
02:29:39,906 --> 02:29:41,205
We are the bridge!

1507
02:29:48,381 --> 02:29:51,479
I thought they chose me.

1508
02:29:54,107 --> 02:29:58,105
But they didn't choose me, they chose her!
-For what Cooper?

1509
02:30:00,604 --> 02:30:02,222
To save the world!

1510
02:30:06,250 --> 02:30:10,378
All of this! In one, little girl's bedroom.

1511
02:30:10,487 --> 02:30:12,906
Every moment, it's infinitely complex.

1512
02:30:13,016 --> 02:30:16,004
They have access to infinite time and space...

1513
02:30:16,014 --> 02:30:17,633
...but they're not bound by anything!

1514
02:30:17,763 --> 02:30:22,510
They can't find, a specific place in time.
They can't communicate.

1515
02:30:22,630 --> 02:30:26,287
That's why I'm here.
-I'm here to find a way...

1516
02:30:26,307 --> 02:30:29,435
...to tell Murph,
just like I found this moment.
-How Cooper?

1517
02:30:29,556 --> 02:30:31,105
Love TARS, love!

1518
02:30:31,225 --> 02:30:34,812
It's just like Brand said,
my connection with Murph, it is quantifiable.

1519
02:30:34,922 --> 02:30:37,420
It is the key. -Why are we here?

1520
02:30:38,620 --> 02:30:40,518
To find out how to tell.

1521
02:30:43,027 --> 02:30:44,797
The watch!

1522
02:30:47,825 --> 02:30:51,482
The watch!

1523
02:30:53,721 --> 02:30:56,878
Encode the data in the
movement of the second hand.

1524
02:31:00,297 --> 02:31:04,295
TARS, translate the data into Morse
and give it to me.

1525
02:31:04,364 --> 02:31:07,722
Translating the data to Morse.
Cooper, what if she never came back for it?

1526
02:31:09,061 --> 02:31:12,689
She will. She will.

1527
02:31:14,308 --> 02:31:18,085
He's coming Murph!

1528
02:31:19,205 --> 02:31:24,182
Okay, coming down!
-How do you know?

1529
02:31:27,629 --> 02:31:29,399
Because I gave it to her!

1530
02:31:34,046 --> 02:31:37,503
Roger Morse is dot dot dash dot,

1531
02:31:40,341 --> 02:31:45,229
Dot, dot, dash, dot,

1532
02:31:45,299 --> 02:31:47,538
dot, dash, dot, dot,

1533
02:31:47,618 --> 02:31:52,294
dot, dash, dot, dot,

1534
02:32:12,192 --> 02:32:16,110
It was him!!

1535
02:32:16,219 --> 02:32:19,528
All the time!!
I knew it!!!

1536
02:32:19,618 --> 02:32:21,796
Dad saved us!!

1537
02:33:05,029 --> 02:33:07,658
Eureka!!!

1538
02:33:10,107 --> 02:33:12,015
It's traditional.

1539
02:33:16,123 --> 02:33:17,882
Eureka!!!

1540
02:33:22,629 --> 02:33:26,026
Did it work?
-I think it might have.

1541
02:33:27,395 --> 02:33:29,055
How do you know?

1542
02:33:29,135 --> 02:33:32,573
Because, the bulk beings
are closing the Tesseract.

1543
02:33:36,400 --> 02:33:38,409
Don't you get it yet TARS?

1544
02:33:38,479 --> 02:33:41,787
They're not beings.

1545
02:33:41,867 --> 02:33:43,556
They're us!

1546
02:33:45,065 --> 02:33:48,843
What I've been doing for Murph,
they've been doing for me!

1547
02:33:48,953 --> 02:33:52,830
For all of us.
-Cooper, people couldn't build this.

1548
02:33:52,910 --> 02:33:57,437
No, no. Not yet. But one day.

1549
02:33:57,587 --> 02:34:01,465
Not you and me. But people.

1550
02:34:01,535 --> 02:34:07,181
A civilization that's evolved
past the 4 dimensions that we know.

1551
02:34:12,738 --> 02:34:13,847
What happens now?

1552
02:35:16,778 --> 02:35:17,638
Mr. Cooper.

1553
02:35:22,285 --> 02:35:26,063
Let's take it slow sir.
Nice and easy Mr. Cooper.

1554
02:35:26,183 --> 02:35:28,941
Remember you're no spring chicken anymore.

1555
02:35:29,051 --> 02:35:31,500
Actually you are one hundred and twenty four years old.

1556
02:35:38,525 --> 02:35:40,144
Take it slow sir.

1557
02:35:41,603 --> 02:35:43,112
You were, um, extremely lucky.

1558
02:35:43,222 --> 02:35:47,499
The Rangers found you with only minutes
left in your oxygen supply.

1559
02:35:59,492 --> 02:36:02,271
Where am I?

1560
02:36:04,179 --> 02:36:05,758
Cooper station.

1561
02:36:07,027 --> 02:36:08,686
Currently orbiting Saturn.

1562
02:36:09,915 --> 02:36:12,664
Cooper station?

1563
02:36:15,412 --> 02:36:17,851
What nice of you to name it after me!

1564
02:36:20,909 --> 02:36:24,487
What?
-Well, the station isn't named after you sir,

1565
02:36:24,607 --> 02:36:26,066
It's uh, it's named after your daughter.

1566
02:36:26,076 --> 02:36:30,493
Although she's always maintained
just how important you were.
-Is she still alive?

1567
02:36:30,573 --> 02:36:34,431
She'll be here in a couple of weeks.

1568
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:38,768
She is far too old to be
transferred from another station...

1569
02:36:38,848 --> 02:36:41,077
...but when she heard that you'd been found.

1570
02:36:41,177 --> 02:36:44,704
Well this is, this is
Murphy Cooper we're talking about!

1571
02:36:44,814 --> 02:36:46,693
Yes it is!

1572
02:36:49,172 --> 02:36:51,190
We'll have you checked out of here
in a couple of days.

1573
02:36:54,248 --> 02:36:56,807
I'm sure you'll be excited to see what's in store.

1574
02:36:57,466 --> 02:37:02,333
I actually uhh, did a paper on you,
in high school,

1575
02:37:02,443 --> 02:37:04,072
I know all about your life back on Earth.

1576
02:37:05,872 --> 02:37:08,569
Oh yeah, right.

1577
02:37:09,938 --> 02:37:16,295
Sir, if you could follow me?
You've got a really good situation.

1578
02:37:20,073 --> 02:37:23,460
So um, when I made my suggestion to Ms. Cooper,

1579
02:37:24,799 --> 02:37:27,738
I was delighted to hear that she thought it was perfect.

1580
02:37:34,354 --> 02:37:38,122
Well of course, I didn't speak to her in person.

1581
02:37:42,339 --> 02:37:47,226
My dad was a farmer.
Like everybody else back then.

1582
02:37:47,335 --> 02:37:50,554
Anyway, there just wasn't enough food.

1583
02:37:50,664 --> 02:37:56,630
We had strips of sheet to
cover our nose and mouth.

1584
02:37:56,930 --> 02:37:59,189
So we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

1585
02:38:06,923 --> 02:38:09,572
She did confirm, just how much you loved farming.

1586
02:38:09,652 --> 02:38:12,040
She did? Did she?

1587
02:38:12,110 --> 02:38:15,419
Well, home sweet home!

1588
02:38:15,499 --> 02:38:19,116
Everything is in its place and
faithfully reproduced.

1589
02:38:19,206 --> 02:38:20,585
Yes.

1590
02:38:25,133 --> 02:38:30,399
Hey, is this? -Oh yeah, the machine
we found out near Saturn with you.

1591
02:38:30,519 --> 02:38:33,877
It's power source is shot,
but we can get another one if you want.

1592
02:38:33,987 --> 02:38:35,746
Yes, please!

1593
02:38:37,005 --> 02:38:37,785
Settings.

1594
02:38:38,983 --> 02:38:39,933
General settings.

1595
02:38:40,973 --> 02:38:42,162
Security settings.

1596
02:38:44,280 --> 02:38:47,298
Honesty, new setting.

1597
02:38:48,528 --> 02:38:53,385
95%
Confirmed. Additional customization?

1598
02:38:53,465 --> 02:38:58,142
Humor: 75%

1599
02:38:58,252 --> 02:38:59,801
Confirmed.

1600
02:38:59,911 --> 02:39:03,918
Auto self destruct T minus 10, 9...

1601
02:39:04,018 --> 02:39:05,608
Let's make that 60%.

1602
02:39:07,376 --> 02:39:10,175
60% confirmed.

1603
02:39:10,255 --> 02:39:13,993
Knock Knock. -You want 55?

1604
02:39:18,360 --> 02:39:20,358
Is this really what it was like?

1605
02:39:22,697 --> 02:39:25,395
It was never this clean slick.

1606
02:39:30,122 --> 02:39:34,639
I don't care much for this, pretending
we are back where we started.

1607
02:39:35,469 --> 02:39:37,698
I want to know where we are?

1608
02:39:38,817 --> 02:39:41,145
Where are we going?

1609
02:39:46,023 --> 02:39:48,481
Mr Cooper. -Yes?
-The family is all in there.

1610
02:39:48,641 --> 02:39:50,270
Family?

1611
02:39:50,380 --> 02:39:54,228
Yeah, they all came out to see her.
She's been in cryo sleep for almost 2 years.

1612
02:40:26,847 --> 02:40:29,616
You told them I liked farming?

1613
02:40:35,052 --> 02:40:36,202
It was me Murph!

1614
02:40:38,641 --> 02:40:41,058
I was your ghost!

1615
02:40:42,108 --> 02:40:43,577
I know.

1616
02:40:45,706 --> 02:40:51,343
People didn't believe me,
they thought I was doing it all myself. But...

1617
02:40:54,520 --> 02:40:56,929
...I knew who it was.

1618
02:41:01,067 --> 02:41:03,155
Nobody believed me.

1619
02:41:03,275 --> 02:41:06,223
But I knew you'd come back.

1620
02:41:08,022 --> 02:41:09,631
How?

1621
02:41:10,980 --> 02:41:14,938
Because my dad promised me!

1622
02:41:21,324 --> 02:41:25,421
I'm here now Murph.
I'm here!

1623
02:41:27,230 --> 02:41:34,666
No. No parent should have
to watch their own child die.

1624
02:41:36,794 --> 02:41:40,931
I have my kids here for me now.

1625
02:41:43,200 --> 02:41:45,269
You go!

1626
02:41:47,817 --> 02:41:48,757
Where?

1627
02:41:52,115 --> 02:41:54,234
Brand.

1628
02:42:03,258 --> 02:42:06,046
She's, out there.

1629
02:42:10,614 --> 02:42:13,572
Setting up camp.

1630
02:42:40,115 --> 02:42:45,542
Alone, in a strange galaxy.

1631
02:42:56,275 --> 02:42:59,743
Maybe right now she's, settling in...

1632
02:42:59,773 --> 02:43:02,092
...for the long nap.

1633
02:43:18,032 --> 02:43:22,459
By the light of our new sun.

1634
02:43:37,360 --> 02:43:40,058
In our new home.
