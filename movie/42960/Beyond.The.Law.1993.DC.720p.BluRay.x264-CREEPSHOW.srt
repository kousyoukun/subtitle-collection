1
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:40,771
You look like hell, Slick.
Have a rough night?

2
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:43,193
Dispatch said there were shots fired.

3
00:03:43,194 --> 00:03:45,075
Yeah, crazy bastard up
in the the rocks there.

4
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,278
Chucked a couple of shots
at the dozer.

5
00:03:47,313 --> 00:03:49,280
He almost killed me.

6
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:53,449
Who is he?
- An old Apache.

7
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:57,753
They call him Bogus Charlie.
Thinks he's a medicine man.

8
00:03:57,788 --> 00:04:01,792
Says we're rapin' his mother
by pokin' holes in the earth.

9
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:06,297
You got any ideas?

10
00:04:06,797 --> 00:04:10,801
Well, he's only shot at the dozer,
but he could change his mind.

11
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:15,306
I had to call in the state police.
They'll be here any minute now.

12
00:04:23,314 --> 00:04:26,317
What the hell are you doing?

13
00:04:26,352 --> 00:04:29,285
Takin' a walk.

14
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,323
That's fuckin' nuts.

15
00:04:32,358 --> 00:04:34,825
Maybe.

16
00:04:50,341 --> 00:04:54,345
Hey, Roy?  You better get
the hell outta here.

17
00:05:01,852 --> 00:05:05,356
How ya doin'?

18
00:05:05,391 --> 00:05:08,126
Never better.

19
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:10,826
You know, I was thinkin'.

20
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:15,831
If you gave me that rifle and offered
to pay for the damage,

21
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:19,870
I could say you were out here hunting
and hit the equipment by mistake.

22
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:25,841
You want jerky?

23
00:05:25,876 --> 00:05:29,380
We don't have time. The state cops
will be here in a few minutes.

24
00:05:29,415 --> 00:05:32,883
- So if you'll just give me that rifle.
- Sit down.

25
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:34,885
Whatever you say.

26
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:39,890
You don't look so good, kid.

27
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:43,394
Something bothering you,
something inside, right?

28
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:46,862
Are you gonna
give me the rifle?

29
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:50,866
You know, my grandfather
told me a story once...

30
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:54,405
About a young brave
who got scared of his shadow...

31
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,674
and ran away from it.
- Look...

32
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:58,909
I told you, sit still.

33
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:03,379
Anyway,

34
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:07,418
This young brave found out he was
only half a person without his shadow,

35
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:09,885
but to get it back...

36
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,424
he had to go down into a dark hole
where only shadows live.

37
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:16,927
Problem was,
anybody went down there...

38
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:19,430
never came back.

39
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:24,900
You've just run
out of time, old man.

40
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:28,939
If you give me the rifle right now,
we can still keep you out of jail.

41
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:31,907
Somethin' else
my grandfather told me...

42
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:34,945
a true Apache had to do
when surrounded...

43
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:38,449
and outnumbered by crazy white men.
- What's that ?

44
00:06:38,484 --> 00:06:40,951
Give the fuck up.

45
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:02,999
Why did you stop me?

46
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:04,966
Huh?

47
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:07,003
Why did you stop me?

48
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:08,970
For speeding.

49
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:12,008
- I wasn't speeding.
- Oh, yes you were.

50
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:14,778
- No, I wasn't.
- I'm afraid you were.

51
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:17,513
May I see your license please?

52
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:27,331
You have a nice face.

53
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:29,876
- Excuse me?
- Good bones.

54
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,882
Where you goin' in such a hurry,
miss Jackson?

55
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,885
- What difference does that make?
- I'll ask the questions, okay?

56
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,388
Okay. I'm going to the campground.

57
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,896
- All this photo equipment yours?
- Of course not.

58
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:52,363
That's why I'm carrying it
around with me.

59
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:56,402
- Look, you don't have to be a complete
smart ass. - You gonna write me a ticket?

60
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:21,427
Get outta here!
Now!

61
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,435
This is car number 50.

62
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:35,942
We'll take care of all the
damages, plus ten percent.

63
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:42,949
And aaa... I put a little somethin'
extra there for you, Kelly.

64
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,453
Hoo, hoo, hoo, yeah!
You did!

65
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:53,960
- I appreciate it that man, I really do.
- I know I do.

66
00:09:53,995 --> 00:09:57,964
Now, if there is anything
else we can do for you...

67
00:09:57,999 --> 00:10:00,967
...anything at all.
- Forget it.

68
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,484
You're in my fuckin' way.

69
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,997
Who the hell was that?

70
00:10:31,113 --> 00:10:35,149
His name's Blood.
He runs that bunch.

71
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:39,689
- I got a bone to pick with you, Saxon.
- That's a surprise.

72
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:42,657
I heard about what
you did this morning.

73
00:10:42,692 --> 00:10:47,196
Where the hell do you get off risking your
ass over some worthless drunken indian?

74
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:52,302
- He wasn't drunk.
- All Indians are nothin' but drunks.

75
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:54,804
Look at me when I'm talkin'...

76
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:59,058
Hold it...

77
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:01,811
You fuckin' crazy stupid son of a bitch!

78
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:05,315
You're fuckin' fired. Come on.

79
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:24,709
- Yeah?
- I'm Conroy Price, Mr. Saxon.

80
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:28,748
Special investigative division
Arizona attorney general's office.

81
00:11:28,783 --> 00:11:31,215
I have a proposition for you.

82
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:35,254
- Does this turtle ever move?
- What do you want, Price?

83
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:39,223
I'm forming an undercover
narcotics operation.

84
00:11:39,258 --> 00:11:44,263
I'm looking for a field officer. You're the
man I need. - How do you figure that?

85
00:11:44,298 --> 00:11:47,266
I know everything there
is to know about you.

86
00:11:47,301 --> 00:11:49,734
Really?

87
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:52,772
Dan Saxon isn't your real name.

88
00:11:54,273 --> 00:11:58,778
You were born William Patrick Steiner
in Manhattan on June 24th, 1966.

89
00:11:58,813 --> 00:12:01,245
Your father was a pipefitter.

90
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,248
Your mother was a full
blooded Chippewa Indian.

91
00:12:03,283 --> 00:12:06,787
You were orphaned when you were 3 and
raised by your uncle who was a policeman.

92
00:12:12,593 --> 00:12:14,560
Shall I go on?

93
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:17,063
Who the hell are you?

94
00:12:17,098 --> 00:12:20,101
I told you, I'm with the
attorney general's office.

95
00:12:20,136 --> 00:12:22,603
Let me give you my card.

96
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:29,610
I'll put it right here.
I'll go on.

97
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:33,079
Because she was a native american,
your uncle hated your mother.

98
00:12:33,114 --> 00:12:37,451
He locked you in a room, hadcuffed you and
beat you repeatedly for the next three years.

99
00:12:37,474 --> 00:12:39,941
How did you find out?

100
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:42,944
I can't tell you that,
but it was no easy task.

101
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:45,982
As you know the judge sealed your
records when you were adopted.

102
00:12:46,017 --> 00:12:48,985
I'm curious about one thing though.
Why become a policeman?

103
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,988
That's a strange thing for you to do
under the under the circumstances,

104
00:12:52,023 --> 00:12:54,258
don't you think?

105
00:12:54,293 --> 00:12:56,458
Then again, maybe not.

106
00:12:56,493 --> 00:13:00,962
What I think... is you better
get the hell outta here.

107
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:04,000
- Wait, let me finish. - Are you gonna
leave, or do I have to throw you out?

108
00:13:04,035 --> 00:13:06,503
I can find my own way out.

109
00:13:07,504 --> 00:13:09,506
Will you think about it?

110
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:13,009
I don't want your god damn job.

111
00:13:13,044 --> 00:13:15,977
Maybe not. But I think you need it.

112
00:13:16,012 --> 00:13:19,516
Something tells me you have some
unfinished business with the blue uniform.

113
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:27,290
I knew you'd change your mind.

114
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:30,828
Well, if you ever mention my
past again, I'll fucking kill you.

115
00:13:30,863 --> 00:13:33,796
- Done.
- Where do we start?

116
00:13:33,831 --> 00:13:36,617
Here's $ 20.000. Sign the
receipt and return it to me.

117
00:13:37,118 --> 00:13:39,585
When you make a buy,
I'll give you more.

118
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,623
Also, instructions on tagging evidence,
drop point procedures...

119
00:13:42,658 --> 00:13:44,590
And some numbers
where I can be reached.

120
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:48,129
Memorize and destroy them.
When you wanna see me, we meet here.

121
00:13:48,164 --> 00:13:50,631
And nobody knows
you're undercover but me.

122
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,634
- I mean nobody.
- I'm gonna have to move.

123
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:58,940
I'll rent a place in Phoenix. I want you to grow
a mustache and change your appearance.

124
00:13:58,975 --> 00:14:02,909
You're an ex cop. If anybodu recognizes
you the'd probably kill you on spec.

125
00:14:02,944 --> 00:14:07,448
- Would you miss me Price? - You can forget
the jokes. I jave no sense of humor.

126
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:11,452
I never have. I've tried several
times to develop one.

127
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:13,955
Even took a workshop. But it didn't work.

128
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:18,209
- Put quite simply, nothing is
funny to me. - That's funny.

129
00:14:18,244 --> 00:14:21,963
Here's a list of all the bars and the
known hangouts for the drug trade.

130
00:14:21,998 --> 00:14:24,931
I want you to make yourself seen.
Spend some money.

131
00:14:24,966 --> 00:14:29,470
Do whatever is necessary to get people to
trust you, short of commiting a felony.

132
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:32,473
Do that, and the whole operation
goes out the window.

133
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:38,444
- Now before we go on, there's
something I have to tell you. - What?

134
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:43,484
My predecessor sent two undercover
officers into Gila county last year.

135
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,987
Both disappeared without a trace.

136
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:48,990
Like they were swallowed up
by some black hole.

137
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,993
It's important you know
what you're up against.

138
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:29,090
Name's Virgil.

139
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:38,099
Gonna get shit-faced if you
keep drinkin' that fast, man.

140
00:16:38,134 --> 00:16:40,601
I hope so.

141
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:54,615
You know, I couldn't help but notice
how much money you're draggin' around.

142
00:16:55,116 --> 00:16:56,617
I need it to buy dope.

143
00:16:57,034 --> 00:17:01,606
Oh. You know, I figured you
for a dealer right off.

144
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:05,074
- Listen...
- Wrong, Virgil.

145
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:08,112
I'm an undercover
narcotics officer.

146
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:13,117
Get the fuck outta here.

147
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,622
You're a narc?

148
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:29,634
Well, if you was narc...

149
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:32,101
And I'm not sayin'
that you are...

150
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:36,641
But, uh, if you was, you could get your
ass dusted for talkin' about it.

151
00:17:36,676 --> 00:17:40,144
Well, what the hell's the
difference? I'm a bust.

152
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:42,146
Nobody will sell dope
to me anyways.

153
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:46,651
That's because of the way you
look, man. I mean, look at you.

154
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:50,655
If you came up to me and tried to buy
dope, I'd peg you for a narc right away.

155
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,123
A minute ago, you said I
looked like a dealer.

156
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:57,662
Fuck you, asshole.
I was trying to be polite.

157
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:12,176
If I was a narc and I wanted to get
into some serious drugs,

158
00:18:12,211 --> 00:18:14,946
I'd hang with bikers.

159
00:18:14,981 --> 00:18:17,682
Bikers control all the heavy dope.

160
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:26,190
I don't know shit about bikers.

161
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:34,198
I could teach ya. Well, I ain't like
a member or nothin',

162
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:37,201
but, uh, they need me.

163
00:18:37,236 --> 00:18:39,168
I work on their bikes.

164
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:42,171
There ain't nothin' about a
scooter that I can't fix.

165
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:44,044
Hell, when I got through with you,

166
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:47,211
you'd walk, talk and shit like a biker.

167
00:18:47,246 --> 00:18:50,680
Why the hell would you do that?

168
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:54,684
Listen, man. Now this is
strictly confidential.

169
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:57,722
- But I've always wanted to be cop.
- Come on.

170
00:18:57,757 --> 00:18:59,689
No, really, man.

171
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:03,978
You know what I mean?
Carrying a fuckin' gun, arrestin' people.

172
00:19:04,013 --> 00:19:08,232
That's power. Hell, you could even
make me your deputy or somethin'.

173
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:10,735
Couldn't you?

174
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:28,753
- Raise your right hand, Virgil.
- I do.

175
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:32,221
Not yet, asshole.

176
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:35,259
- We got a whole ceremony to do first.
- Sorry, man.

177
00:19:35,294 --> 00:19:39,228
Do you solemnly swear
to take all of my orders...

178
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:41,766
never shoot anybody
or carry a gun?

179
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:44,286
- Wait a minute, man.
- No guns, Virgil.

180
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:46,771
Any shooting needs done,
I'll handle it.

181
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,273
I'm the narc. You're
the fuckin' deputy.

182
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:53,778
Well that ain't fair, man! How can I fuckin'
arrest anybody if I haven't got a gun?

183
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:58,282
- Do you swear or not?
- Yeah, I-I-I guess so, man.

184
00:19:58,317 --> 00:20:00,785
Good.

185
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:04,288
Then it is with all
the power in my office...

186
00:20:04,323 --> 00:20:06,791
deputy sheriff.

187
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,293
sheriff's deputy.

188
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:13,798
Oh, man.
This is somethin'.

189
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,800
This is really somethin'.

190
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,304
- Are you sure you're a cop?
- Where do we start?

191
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:35,820
Modest beginnings start
with a single blow of a horn, man.

192
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:39,824
Now, when you get through
with this thing,

193
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:43,327
every dick-head in the world's
gonna wanna own it.

194
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:49,834
Do you know anything at all about
the internal combustion engine?

bad-ass, outlaw motorcycle brotherhood.

Bikers all got nicknames.

Well, you're not dirty enough.
You're not crazy enough.

257
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,253
I'm gettin' really fuckin' tired
of hearing you say that.

Yeah? Well, being tired

parking lot in Linkville.

Hello, dude. What do ya think

You just stole this car from the
Denny's parking lot in Linkville.

271
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:41,317
How in the fuck
did you know that, man ?

272
00:26:41,352 --> 00:26:45,321
- You've involved me in a felony, Virgil.
- I was getting bored.

273
00:26:45,356 --> 00:26:49,360
- Bein' a cop ain't everything I thought
it was gonna be. - What's that in your belt?

274
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,864
- Nothing. - Bullshit! It's a
pistol. You swore no guns.

275
00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:56,832
Now take it out
and put it on the seat.

276
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:59,870
- I was just tryin' to have
a little fun, man. - Fun?

277
00:26:59,905 --> 00:27:02,838
I oughta kill you !
Now follow me back down the hill...

278
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:06,877
so we can dump this piece of shit
before somebody catches us.

279
00:28:03,434 --> 00:28:05,436
Shit!

280
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:19,950

You're crazy enough now, dude.

285
00:28:42,773 --> 00:28:45,307
You're definitely crazy enough.

Don't talk too much today, and remember. If
somebody gives you a dare, you gotta take it.

315
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:15,959
This is serious. This isn't a game.
You fuck up, they're gonna kill ya.

316
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,948
So I pick up the fuckin' Hammer,

317
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:43,487
and the guy says, "you're not gonna
hit me with that, are ya ?"

318
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:49,493
So I say, "no way, man.
I'm gonna brain your fuckin' wife."

319
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:56,965
Oatmeal.
How's your head, man?

320
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,468
How the fuck would I know, dildo ?

321
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:04,508
The last contact I had with my head
was six fuckin' years ago.

322
00:32:04,543 --> 00:32:09,513
- What the fuck are you supposed to be ?
- This is Sid, man.

323
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:16,485
What's it say on your jacket there, Sid?

324
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,988
Pythons?
From Cleveland, fuckin' Ohio?

325
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:25,028
Sid, this is Oatmeal. Oatmeal's got the
biggest testicles in the state of Arizona.

326
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:32,035
- Wanna crank up the ol' noggin, Sid ?
- I'll do it. Thanks.

327
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:35,003
So, Sid...

328
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:39,542
what kind of games do they
play in Cleveland, Ohio?

329
00:32:39,577 --> 00:32:44,047
Guns, man.
We like to play with guns.

330
00:32:44,082 --> 00:32:46,049
You boys got any guns?

331
00:32:50,604 --> 00:32:53,572
Yeah, I guess we got some guns.

332
00:32:53,607 --> 00:32:56,610
Pick yourself out one.
We'll shoot some cans.

333
00:32:56,645 --> 00:32:59,578
Or somethin'.
You got any money?

334
00:32:59,613 --> 00:33:03,116
Has he got any money?
Jesus Christ. Is the pope a Cadillac?

335
00:33:05,118 --> 00:33:08,622
Well, you ain't gonna have it long, Slick.

336
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,632
Your turn.

337
00:33:24,137 --> 00:33:26,605
Who is that?

338
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,643
Some kind of writer
doin' a book on bikers.

339
00:33:29,678 --> 00:33:32,646
Um, name's Renee, man.
Don't pay no fuckin' attention to her.

340
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:36,399
- Go ahead and shoot. Shoot, man, shoot.
- Come on, Sid.

341
00:33:36,434 --> 00:33:39,653
We ain't got all fuckin' day.

342
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:44,658
- You missed.
- Wrong.

343
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:49,162
Bullshit, man. You fuckin' hit a can, it
fuckin' moves. The fuckin' can didn't move.

344
00:33:49,197 --> 00:33:53,183
- You callin' me a liar?
- I'm callin' you worse than a liar.

345
00:33:53,218 --> 00:33:57,170
I'm sayin' the Pythons
are a sissy-ass club.

346
00:33:57,671 --> 00:34:01,174
And you are a chicken-shit
dog motherfucker.

347
00:34:05,178 --> 00:34:08,181
- What the fuck you doin', man ?
- I'm gonna try again, Oatmeal.

348
00:34:08,682 --> 00:34:11,184
I wanna make sure
the can moves this time.

349
00:34:11,685 --> 00:34:14,938
Geez, what, are you fuckin' nuts?

350
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,670
Stupid son of a bitch.
I'm gonna kill ya!

351
00:34:31,705 --> 00:34:34,708
- Who the fuck you gonna kill now,
blubber guts ? - Aw, Jesus.

352
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:38,211
- Who ?
- I didn't mean nothin', man.

353
00:34:38,246 --> 00:34:41,714
- Okay, who set off the fuckin' dynamite ?
- I did.

354
00:34:41,715 --> 00:34:44,217
- It was just a...
- Virgil, shut your mouth.

355
00:34:44,718 --> 00:34:47,721
- Who the fuck are you ?
- His name's Sid, man.

356
00:34:47,756 --> 00:34:50,241
What the fuck did I just
say to you? Shut up.

357
00:34:50,276 --> 00:34:52,691
- Absolutely.
- What's goin' on, Sid?

358
00:34:52,726 --> 00:34:56,229
- You rat-fucked my colors.
- Hey, I was just screwin' around.

359
00:34:56,264 --> 00:34:58,231
Get him to back off, Blood.

360
00:34:58,732 --> 00:35:01,234
What are you gonna do?

361
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,242
I think I'm gonna shoot him.

362
00:35:09,743 --> 00:35:13,747
Aw, geez. Aw, man,
I didn't mean anything. Please.

363
00:35:13,782 --> 00:35:17,716
- Jesus, please.
- Dirt, get her outta here.

364
00:35:17,751 --> 00:35:21,254
Goddamn it, I didn't mean anything.
Come on, give me a break.

365
00:35:21,289 --> 00:35:23,722
Fuck!
Jesus H. Christ!

366
00:35:23,757 --> 00:35:27,761
You shoot him and I'll blow your
motherfuckin' brains out.

367
00:35:27,796 --> 00:35:29,728
Nobody lives forever.

368
00:35:29,763 --> 00:35:32,766
That's a fact.
Now shoot the fucker.

369
00:35:33,266 --> 00:35:35,233
Oh, Jesus, I was just...

370
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:39,773
I was just foolin' around.
It didn't mean nothin'.

371
00:35:40,273 --> 00:35:44,277
I'll kiss your fuckin' colors. I like your colors. I love
your fuckin' colors. Your colors are wonderful.

372
00:35:44,312 --> 00:35:47,280
Oh, geez, I'm peein' here!

373
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:59,793
Hey, this is supposed to be a wedding here.
Now, where's the goddamn bride?

374
00:36:13,306 --> 00:36:19,312
All right, we all came out here today
so Bubbles and Highside here can get married.

375
00:36:19,347 --> 00:36:23,817
I want all you fuckin' assholes
to show a little bit of respect.

376
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:32,325
Do you, Bubbles, swear on this bible
you wanna let this..

377
00:36:32,826 --> 00:36:35,293
smelly old scuzball, Highside,

378
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:38,331
lubricate your cylinder and, uh...
- Don't do it!

379
00:36:38,832 --> 00:36:40,834
flush out your oil tank?

380
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:42,801
I do.

381
00:36:42,836 --> 00:36:46,840
Do you, Highside, wanna let
this ugly old bag...

382
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,344
handle your great big rod and little roller
bearings in the decidedly up-and-down fashion?

383
00:36:51,379 --> 00:36:55,348
- Yeah, what the fuck.
- Give the broad some tongue.

384
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:28,882
We got a very unusual
situation here, Sid.

385
00:37:31,885 --> 00:37:34,888
Hey, Blood. How you doin' ?

386
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:41,394
Anybody pulls down on my family,
they usually end up dead.

387
00:37:41,895 --> 00:37:45,899
But Oatmeal shit
on your colors and...

388
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:48,401
I like loyalty.

389
00:37:51,905 --> 00:37:55,408
So in your case,
I guess I made an exception.

390
00:37:59,412 --> 00:38:01,915
- I know you from somewhere, don't I?
- I don't think so.

391
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,882
No?

392
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:05,919
Trust me.

393
00:38:09,923 --> 00:38:12,926
If you met me before,
you wouldn't fuckin' forget it.

394
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:15,393
Uh-huh.

395
00:38:15,428 --> 00:38:19,898
Look, man,
I wanna move some contraband.

396
00:38:19,933 --> 00:38:22,936
Buy it here, sell it in the midwest
and people say I gotta deal with you.

397
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:26,940
- Is that right?
- What people is that, I wonder?

398
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,443
Oh, you mean I got it all wrong?

399
00:38:33,947 --> 00:38:36,915
Sid...

400
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:40,954
You're either the dumbest fucker
I ever met in my life or...

401
00:38:40,989 --> 00:38:43,957
you got the balls of an elephant.

402
00:38:43,992 --> 00:38:46,459
Which one is it?

403
00:38:46,494 --> 00:38:49,427
You choose.

404
00:38:49,462 --> 00:38:51,965
Well, that's exactly what I'm gonna do,

405
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,968
hotshot.

406
00:39:35,191 --> 00:39:37,694
So dry.

407
00:39:40,196 --> 00:39:43,199
One of these days, it has to rain.

408
00:39:45,201 --> 00:39:48,705
When it rains in the desert,
it's like...

409
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,708
everything starts all over again.

410
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:56,212
You still a cop?

411
00:39:59,716 --> 00:40:01,718
You are, aren't you?

412
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,973
Don't worry.
They won't recognize you.

413
00:40:07,008 --> 00:40:10,226
You don't look anything
like you used to.

414
00:40:10,261 --> 00:40:12,193
It's still a nice face.

415
00:40:12,228 --> 00:40:16,232
Do you have any idea
what would happen if they found out?

416
00:40:21,304 --> 00:40:24,390
What you're doing is very dangerous.
You know that, don't you?

417
00:40:24,425 --> 00:40:27,894
- Oh, is it?
- Never mind.

418
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:29,896
None of my business.

419
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,904
One piece of advice.
Don't underestimate Blood.

420
00:40:38,404 --> 00:40:41,407
He's smart. He'll kill you
without a second thought.

421
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:45,411
Where are ya goin'?

422
00:40:46,913 --> 00:40:48,880
Home.

423
00:40:48,915 --> 00:40:50,917
Can I give ya a lift?

424
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:56,422
I don't think so. I'm strictly
a solo act these days.

425
00:40:58,424 --> 00:41:01,392
Besides, don't take it personally,

426
00:41:01,427 --> 00:41:04,430
but I don't think you have
much of a future.

427
00:41:39,465 --> 00:41:42,969
Sid?

428
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:46,472
See that place
across the street?

429
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:49,976
Big-time redneck bar.

430
00:41:50,476 --> 00:41:53,479
Those fuckin' guys
hate bikers, man.

431
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:58,484
I got 50 bucks says
you ain't got balls big enough...

432
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:02,005
to ride your sled
through the front door.

433
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,456
- Man, that's suicide.
- Shut up, dildo.

434
00:42:05,491 --> 00:42:08,494
No big deal.
I hate rednecks almost as much...

435
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:10,997
as guys who piss themselves.

436
00:42:25,511 --> 00:42:29,515
- What do you think? Is he gonna do it?
- I don't know, man.

437
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,362
Anybody got a light?

438
00:43:36,916 --> 00:43:39,419
What's up, Blood?

439
00:43:57,437 --> 00:44:00,905
- How many guys in the Pythons, Sid ?
- Enough.

440
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:04,409
I think I've heard of you guys before.
Pythons.

441
00:44:04,444 --> 00:44:07,947
Yeah, I've heard of you guys before.
Pythons are cool.

442
00:44:07,982 --> 00:44:10,415
Jackals is better.

443
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:14,419
- Wanna be a Jackal, Sid ?
- I got my own club.

444
00:44:14,454 --> 00:44:18,958
You wanna talk business or are
we gonna kiss each other all day?

445
00:44:24,464 --> 00:44:28,968
- Now what do you wanna buy?
- What's for sale?

446
00:44:29,003 --> 00:44:31,471
Tell 'im, Dirt.

447
00:44:31,971 --> 00:44:34,223
Everything, man.

448
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:36,476
Ludes, trees, grass,

449
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:38,478
stars, crank.

450
00:44:38,978 --> 00:44:41,481
- We got labs makin' the shit.
- What about guns?

451
00:44:41,516 --> 00:44:43,948
Any fuckin' thing you want.

452
00:44:43,983 --> 00:44:47,987
Pogo sticks, foreign jobs.
You want a goddamn rocket launcher,

453
00:44:48,488 --> 00:44:50,455
we can get it.

454
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,992
Dirt will show you
around tomorrow, but, uh,

455
00:44:53,027 --> 00:44:56,461
'til then, I know where there's a party.

456
00:44:56,496 --> 00:45:01,000
And wherever there's a party,
there's a lot of cooze.

457
00:45:01,035 --> 00:45:03,002
What do ya say, Sid?

458
00:45:08,508 --> 00:45:11,010
You can forget all about that.
Everybody I know has tried.

459
00:45:11,045 --> 00:45:15,014
She paid Blood $5,000
to take pictures of the Jackals.

460
00:45:15,049 --> 00:45:18,483
- Blood's gonna be famous.
- Shut up!

461
00:45:18,518 --> 00:45:21,020
Don't say anything,
don't do anything.

462
00:45:21,055 --> 00:45:24,023
Just fuckin' sit there.

463
00:45:29,529 --> 00:45:32,031
Let's get the fuck outta here.

464
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:02,912
You're a real good pool player, man.

465
00:46:03,412 --> 00:46:07,917
- You wanna make a little wager?
- Ya mean like a bet?

466
00:46:07,952 --> 00:46:11,385
Only thing is I'm not gonna be
doin' the actual playing.

467
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,924
- I'm just gonna bet.
- Who's gonna play?

468
00:46:14,959 --> 00:46:17,391
She is.

469
00:46:17,426 --> 00:46:20,930
Let me get this straight. You ain't
gonna play me? The broad is?

470
00:46:20,965 --> 00:46:22,932
She's gonna play both of you.

471
00:46:23,432 --> 00:46:24,934
- Both of them?
- Right.

472
00:46:26,936 --> 00:46:30,940
- How much?
- Fifty bucks.

473
00:47:35,137 --> 00:47:38,606
You lose, lady.

474
00:47:38,641 --> 00:47:41,393
You just scratched.
We win.

475
00:47:41,428 --> 00:47:44,146
- Better not touch that money.
- Why not?

476
00:47:45,648 --> 00:47:50,152
'Cause my friend here
will beat the crap outta you.

477
00:47:50,187 --> 00:47:54,156
- Both of you.
- Both of them?

478
00:47:56,659 --> 00:47:59,126
You heard her, man.

479
00:47:59,161 --> 00:48:03,666
Get off that stool. Or ain't you
got no hair on your cute little ass?

480
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:07,169
Jesus!

481
00:48:16,178 --> 00:48:20,683
- How we doing? - Can you gimme
a hand here for Christ's sake?

Like they're looking right through you.

512
00:50:56,672 --> 00:50:59,174
So what are you doin' tomorrow?

513
00:50:59,209 --> 00:51:01,677
What time is it?

514
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:05,646
It's only 7:30.

515
00:51:05,681 --> 00:51:07,683
You have to go.

516
00:51:08,184 --> 00:51:11,187
Are you expecting somebody?

517
00:51:13,189 --> 00:51:16,692
No, I...
I have to pick up my little girl.

518
00:51:17,193 --> 00:51:20,196
Okay. I'll wait here.

519
00:51:20,696 --> 00:51:24,200
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- What's her name?

520
00:51:29,705 --> 00:51:32,173
Marybette. She's six.

521
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:35,676
She's my... Look,
I don't want this to be a problem,

522
00:51:35,711 --> 00:51:40,215
but I think you should go.
- There isn't gonna be any problem, Renee.

523
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:44,720
You've got a six-year-old daughter
named Marybette, and I wanna meet her.

524
00:51:44,755 --> 00:51:49,190
How long until you get back?

525
00:51:49,225 --> 00:51:52,728
- I'll be back in half an hour.
- I'll be here.

526
00:51:55,464 --> 00:51:59,468
The shower's down the hall.
There's coffee in the kitchen.

527
00:51:59,969 --> 00:52:03,472
Half an hour?

528
00:52:03,507 --> 00:52:06,475
Get outta here.

529
00:52:32,001 --> 00:52:34,503
Marybette, she's six.

530
00:52:42,511 --> 00:52:45,514
...when you were six.

531
00:53:02,331 --> 00:53:04,583
What are you doing?

532
00:53:04,618 --> 00:53:06,800
I am creating something.

533
00:53:06,835 --> 00:53:11,340
- What is it ?
- Uh, it's a mess.

534
00:53:13,342 --> 00:53:18,347
No, it is not a mess.
It is an old, secret recipe...

535
00:53:18,382 --> 00:53:20,849
that is no longer a secret.

536
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:25,319
Now we have zee
vanilla ice cream.

537
00:53:25,354 --> 00:53:29,858
And we have zee melted peanut
better and grape juice.

538
00:53:33,164 --> 00:53:36,365
And a personal favorite of mine.

539
00:53:38,367 --> 00:53:40,369
Come here.

540
00:53:42,871 --> 00:53:45,374
Pick a hand.

541
00:53:47,876 --> 00:53:50,344
Oreo cookies.

542
00:53:50,379 --> 00:53:53,882
But... I prefer them crushed.

543
00:53:56,385 --> 00:53:58,387
We pour the crushed oreos...

544
00:53:58,887 --> 00:54:01,890
into the melted peanut butter,

545
00:54:02,391 --> 00:54:05,394
and we continue to crush them.

546
00:54:08,397 --> 00:54:10,364
Oh!

547
00:54:10,399 --> 00:54:13,902
Do not overcrush.

548
00:54:13,937 --> 00:54:17,371
Now, voila!

549
00:54:17,406 --> 00:54:19,408
Madame would like a taste?

550
00:54:19,443 --> 00:54:22,411
- You're insane.
- I want some.

551
00:54:27,549 --> 00:54:30,636
Would you prefer smoking
or non-smoking?

552
00:54:30,671 --> 00:54:32,638
What do you think?

553
00:54:33,138 --> 00:54:35,641
Non-smoking.

554
00:54:52,157 --> 00:54:54,459

- A what?
- Let's get outta here.

585
00:57:01,286 --> 00:57:06,291
Hey, Sid. Heh, get your ass
up here, man.  Come on.

586
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:18,303
Now, Waldo, this individual that you see
before you is the man I've been talkin' about.

587
00:57:18,338 --> 00:57:21,807
How many months we been
workin' together? Two, three?

588
00:57:21,842 --> 00:57:23,774
Who counts?

589
00:57:23,809 --> 00:57:27,778
Man, I do. I count everything.

590
00:57:27,813 --> 00:57:31,817
By my count, we been doin'
pretty well together.

591
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:39,289
Makin' lots of money,
get along pretty good.

592
00:57:39,324 --> 00:57:44,830
But that's not what I'm talkin' about
and that's not why I'm sayin' all this.

593
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:49,835
It's because, uh, I like you, man.

594
00:57:52,337 --> 00:57:54,304
I look at you, I see me.

595
00:57:54,339 --> 00:57:59,344
You know, you're smart,
don't take shit from anybody.

596
00:57:59,379 --> 00:58:01,812
I like that.

597
00:58:01,847 --> 00:58:05,851
Except I think you got,
uh, one small problem.

598
00:58:06,351 --> 00:58:10,355
You got your priorities
all fucked up.

599
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:14,359
You know, maybe like you're
a little bit, uh, confused.

600
00:58:14,394 --> 00:58:17,379
Confused about what?

601
00:58:17,414 --> 00:58:20,365
I think you got this thing
about weakness,

602
00:58:20,866 --> 00:58:23,869
about feelin' sorry for weak people.

603
00:58:23,904 --> 00:58:26,837
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
hangin' around with that freak.

604
00:58:26,872 --> 00:58:31,877
Feelin' sorry for anybody is a
complete fuckin' waste of time.

605
00:58:31,912 --> 00:58:34,379
But you do it.

606
00:58:36,381 --> 00:58:39,349
I mean, man, what are you,
some kind of a...

knight in shining armor
lookin' for damsels in distress?

608
00:58:46,892 --> 00:58:50,896
Ordinarily, I don't do
this because, uh,

609
00:58:51,396 --> 00:58:53,838
you know, I'm the president
and I don't sponsor anybody

610
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:55,901
because I didn't think it was right.

611
00:58:57,402 --> 00:59:02,407
But, uh, I wanna sponsor
you for the Jackals.

612
00:59:02,442 --> 00:59:04,409
What do ya say?

613
00:59:06,411 --> 00:59:10,916
Let me think about it.

614
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:14,419
Excuse me?

615
00:59:14,669 --> 00:59:17,255
Let me think about it.
Let me give it some thought.

616
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:20,223
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

617
00:59:20,258 --> 00:59:25,228
Listen man, I got my own club.
Lotta guys depend on me.

618
00:59:25,263 --> 00:59:28,266
Now, what kind of a prick would I be if
I turned on 'em the first time somethin'...

619
00:59:28,767 --> 00:59:31,269
different and better came along, eh?

620
00:59:31,304 --> 00:59:33,772
- Hey, Sid.
- Gimme that, man.

621
00:59:34,272 --> 00:59:37,240
Hey! What the fuck is your problem?

622
00:59:37,275 --> 00:59:40,278
Every time somebody offers Sid
some nose candy, you end up with it.

623
00:59:40,779 --> 00:59:42,746
Now, why is that?

624
00:59:42,781 --> 00:59:47,786
What the fuck's wrong with you?
You can't get high with your friends?

625
01:00:30,829 --> 01:00:33,832
There is no way
you can join the Jackals.

626
01:00:34,332 --> 01:00:38,086
You have to commit a felony in front of
two members. It's in their bylaws.

627
01:00:38,121 --> 01:00:41,840
- Use your head, Daniel. You're supposed
to be a cop. - Oh, is that it?

628
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:46,344
- For a second, I almost forgot.
- God, I hate this weather.

629
01:00:46,379 --> 01:00:49,848
Doesn't it ever rain?

630
01:00:53,351 --> 01:00:58,321
- Okay. What's the matter?
- Nothin'.

631
01:00:58,356 --> 01:01:01,860
Look, we've only been
at this a short time...

632
01:01:01,895 --> 01:01:05,881
and we've succeeded beyond
anyone's expectations.

633
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:10,394
We've logged over
300 pieces of evidence.

634
01:01:10,429 --> 01:01:14,873
Daniel, the director of the
FBI called me yesterday.

635
01:01:15,373 --> 01:01:19,878
- Me, personally. Huh! I couldn't
believe it... - That's great, Price.

636
01:01:19,913 --> 01:01:22,380
I'm really thrilled for ya.

637
01:01:34,392 --> 01:01:37,360
You've got a shell
around you a mile thick.

638
01:01:37,395 --> 01:01:41,865
Now, you're gonna have to open up
to somebody. It might as well be me.

639
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,402
- Now, if I can talk... - Fuck you,
man! I don't wanna talk to you.

640
01:01:44,437 --> 01:01:48,406
- I'm not even sure If I like you!
- Hold on!

641
01:01:54,412 --> 01:01:58,381
- Next week is San Carlos run.
- Yeah.

642
01:01:58,416 --> 01:02:03,421
Our calculation is that over 50
motorcycle gangs will be involved.

643
01:02:03,456 --> 01:02:05,823
What's your point?

644
01:02:07,926 --> 01:02:10,929
- The FBI wants you to take one of their
agents in undercover. - No fuckin' way!

645
01:02:10,964 --> 01:02:13,932
- They have an experienced officer they
feel can pass. - Too goddamn dangerous!

646
01:02:14,432 --> 01:02:16,046
There'll be 20 more state
cops in marked cars...

647
01:02:16,047 --> 01:02:17,400
I won't do it, goddamn it!

648
01:02:17,435 --> 01:02:19,339
FBI wants to send somebody
in, you let 'em.

649
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:22,440
But I'll tell you right now,
he'll fuck up and they'll kill him!

650
01:02:22,941 --> 01:02:26,444
And then you can call the director
of the FBI and tell him about it.

651
01:02:26,479 --> 01:02:30,448
You can call him, Price, personally.

652
01:02:36,955 --> 01:02:39,958
I'm not going to San Carlos today.

653
01:02:39,993 --> 01:02:42,961
I need to catch up in the darkroom.

654
01:02:46,965 --> 01:02:49,467
Do you remember
what happened last night?

655
01:02:51,469 --> 01:02:54,437
You had a nightmare.

656
01:02:54,472 --> 01:02:57,725
I woke up, you were
crying like a little kid...

657
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,979
begging somebody
to stop hitting you.

658
01:03:03,481 --> 01:03:06,484
I held you for a while.
I thought you woke up, but...

659
01:03:06,519 --> 01:03:10,989
you looked at me and you said,

660
01:03:11,024 --> 01:03:14,993
"take the, the handcuffs off."

661
01:03:17,996 --> 01:03:20,498
Jesus.

662
01:03:28,006 --> 01:03:31,509
I'm almost finished here, Dan.
I have all the pictures I need.

663
01:03:31,544 --> 01:03:35,513
I'm gonna write the story in L.A.

664
01:03:35,548 --> 01:03:38,016
That's good.

665
01:03:40,018 --> 01:03:45,023
Have you... thought about what
you're gonna do after this?

666
01:03:48,026 --> 01:03:50,493
I thought...
Maybe we could make...

667
01:03:50,528 --> 01:03:56,034
peanut butter and grape juice
drinks for the next few years.

668
01:03:57,535 --> 01:04:00,003
I'm really scared.

669
01:04:00,038 --> 01:04:04,042
Renee, don't worry.
I'm okay.

670
01:04:05,543 --> 01:04:08,546
I gotta go.

671
01:04:20,058 --> 01:04:23,561
I really am... I'm okay.

672
01:04:28,566 --> 01:04:31,569
I don't think so.

673
01:04:34,072 --> 01:04:37,575
♪("Body Bags" By Saigon Kick)♪

674
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:02,699
Where'd you get your scooter at?

675
01:07:02,723 --> 01:07:05,023
- Get your fuckin' hands off me!
- Lyin' motherfuckin' cocksucker!

676
01:07:05,047 --> 01:07:08,147
- I'll kill ya! - That motherfuckin' scooter
belongs to a brother of mine!

677
01:07:08,171 --> 01:07:11,271
- Piece of shit! - You know what
you are? You're a fuckin' pig!

678
01:07:11,495 --> 01:07:13,495
Pig-sticker motherfucker,
that's what you are!

679
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,760
Highside, what the fuck
is going on over here?

680
01:07:16,784 --> 01:07:18,984
This worthless piece of shit's
a fuckin' cop.

681
01:07:20,108 --> 01:07:23,908
I know this scooter. It belonged to a brother
of mine. FBI confiscated it over months ago.

682
01:07:27,432 --> 01:07:29,432
Kill the bastard!

683
01:07:37,056 --> 01:07:39,156
They made him.
Let's move!

684
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,080
- The fuck are you lookin' at, pig?
- Take it easy, friend.

685
01:08:46,704 --> 01:08:50,204
- We don't want anybody to get hurt.
- Then get the fuck outta my face!

686
01:08:50,628 --> 01:08:52,728
And take the rest
of these pigs with you.

687
01:09:32,383 --> 01:09:35,386
Damn, Sid, you were really
out there, brother.

688
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:38,389
- I hate cops, Blood.
- Hey, me too.

689
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:42,358
I hate 'em more than anything.

690
01:09:42,393 --> 01:09:47,899
Some of those undercover guys
are pretty clever.

691
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:50,902
You ever get conned by one?

692
01:09:56,407 --> 01:10:00,411
I can smell a cop a hundred
miles away, man.

693
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:12,388
Holy shit, man,
you got balls that clank.

694
01:10:12,423 --> 01:10:15,426
You get some kinda kick outta
pushin' like that? Hmm?

695
01:10:18,429 --> 01:10:20,192
I met a couple of dudes from the Dusters, man.

696
01:10:20,193 --> 01:10:22,433
Gonna sell us some heroin on the way back.

697
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:26,938
- How much? - That's the interesting
part, man. As much as we fuckin' want.

698
01:10:27,438 --> 01:10:29,440
- We're gonna need some wheels though.
- Done.

699
01:10:29,941 --> 01:10:32,443
Psycho-fucking-delic!

700
01:10:37,448 --> 01:10:42,418
Thirty grand, on the button. Listen, man,
can you give us a lift back to town?

701
01:10:42,453 --> 01:10:46,457
- I wanna leave my truck here. - Oh,
no, man, we're goin' the other way, man.

702
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:49,961
Yeah, we'll take ya.
Get in.

703
01:11:16,988 --> 01:11:20,456
Hey, man, can't you wait?

704
01:11:20,491 --> 01:11:23,621
Who the fuck waits, man?

705
01:11:23,622 --> 01:11:26,497
Commuters wait for trains.
I don't wait for nobody.

706
01:11:38,509 --> 01:11:41,377
Do you want a fix first?

707
01:11:41,412 --> 01:11:43,976
No, man, he's safety conscious.

708
01:11:43,977 --> 01:11:47,117
You know, like, do not geeze and drive.

709
01:12:02,533 --> 01:12:06,537
- Who do you know in Cleveland, man?
- None of your fuckin' business.

710
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:09,040
My fuckin' business?

711
01:12:26,057 --> 01:12:29,560
What fuckin' street do you
live on in Cleveland, man?

712
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:32,063
Fuck you!

713
01:12:33,564 --> 01:12:35,566
Hey, goddamn it, man!

714
01:13:06,597 --> 01:13:09,100
Kick your fuckin' ass !

715
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:12,068
- Aaah!
- What are you doin'?

716
01:13:12,103 --> 01:13:15,106
Goddamn it, man!

717
01:13:16,607 --> 01:13:19,610
Cut it out! Now!

718
01:13:24,115 --> 01:13:27,868
I got an idea.
Let's shoot each other.

719
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:31,622
- You go first.
- Holy Jesus, man!

720
01:13:33,624 --> 01:13:36,627
You're crazy.

721
01:13:56,147 --> 01:13:59,150
Let's get the hell outta here.

722
01:14:03,154 --> 01:14:06,082
- Get in the car, Virgil.
- I don't think so, man.

723
01:14:06,083 --> 01:14:08,158
This is where Virgil gets off.

724
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:13,129
- What are you talkin' about? - You man,
that's what the fuck I'm talkin' about!

725
01:14:13,164 --> 01:14:17,418
- I mean, look at this shit.
- You're fuckin' nuts!

726
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:21,637
If you ever was a cop,
you ain't a cop anymore.

727
01:14:21,672 --> 01:14:24,675
I mean, no fuckin' cop in the
world does shit like that!

728
01:14:28,679 --> 01:14:33,184
Here, man, you get yourself a new deputy.
I just can't keep up with you no more.

729
01:14:38,189 --> 01:14:40,191
Okay.

730
01:14:42,193 --> 01:14:45,196
I'll see you around...

731
01:14:47,698 --> 01:14:49,700
dildo.

732
01:15:16,227 --> 01:15:19,230
Shit.

733
01:15:32,743 --> 01:15:38,249
Get your hands in the air and get
out of the car. Come on, move!

734
01:15:40,251 --> 01:15:43,719
All right, now, you turn around.
Do it!

735
01:15:43,754 --> 01:15:50,261
Lock your hands behind your head.
You stay right there, asshole.

736
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:53,229
- Gimme your hands.
- Take it easy.

737
01:15:53,264 --> 01:15:55,766
- You got any kinda I.D.?
- What the fuck did I do?

738
01:15:56,267 --> 01:16:01,272
What'd you do?
You got born, birdbrain!

739
01:16:03,774 --> 01:16:05,741
You gotta gimme a phone call.

740
01:16:05,776 --> 01:16:09,780
- You'll get one when I get around to it!
- Heh-heh!

741
01:16:10,281 --> 01:16:13,784
- You gotta give me a fuckin' phone call!
- Sit down, kid.

742
01:16:14,285 --> 01:16:17,288
There's nothin' you can do.

743
01:16:21,792 --> 01:16:24,760
Charlie?

744
01:16:24,795 --> 01:16:27,798
Bogus Charlie?

745
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,802
I know you?

746
01:16:32,303 --> 01:16:36,307
You told me a story about an Indian
who ran away from his shadow, remember?

747
01:16:36,807 --> 01:16:40,311
Oh, yeah.
You don't look like the same...

748
01:16:40,811 --> 01:16:44,815
Why did you tell me that?
Why did you tell me that?

749
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:48,819
I don't know.
Jesus Christ, you're chokin' me!

750
01:16:50,321 --> 01:16:52,823
I'm sorry.

751
01:16:57,161 --> 01:17:00,164
The Indian in the story,
what happens to him?

752
01:17:03,167 --> 01:17:07,171
He goes down into his hole
and finds his shadow.

753
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:09,638
A moon woman
sews it back on for him.

754
01:17:09,673 --> 01:17:15,179
But before he can climb
back out he has to meet...

755
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:16,645
Who?

756
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:20,184
- Look, kid, it's just a story...
- Who does he have to meet?

757
01:17:22,186 --> 01:17:24,188
Death.

758
01:17:27,191 --> 01:17:29,658
I gotta get the fuck outta here.

759
01:17:29,693 --> 01:17:34,163
You spit in my face, you beat
a federal agent almost half to death.

760
01:17:34,198 --> 01:17:37,451
Then you point your gun at a state
trooper and dare him to shoot you.

761
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:40,704
- I did what I had to, damn it. - You did
more than that. You were enjoying yourself.

762
01:17:41,205 --> 01:17:44,173
I saw you! You've jeopardized
this entire operation.

763
01:17:44,208 --> 01:17:47,211
There isn't a cop within a thousand
miles who isn't gunnin' for you!

764
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:52,216
Fuck 'em! And fuck you!

765
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:01,690
Everything's turnin' to shit.
It's gotta stop.

766
01:18:01,725 --> 01:18:05,729
- Look... - I don't wanna go on with
this any more. Let's make some arrests.

767
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:09,698
It's obvious you're
under a terrible strain.

768
01:18:09,733 --> 01:18:13,702
But now is not the best time
to terminate the operation.

769
01:18:13,737 --> 01:18:16,719
- I can't do this anymore!
- Just give me two weeks.

770
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:18,041
We've worked so hard on this.

771
01:18:18,076 --> 01:18:19,788
Everything we've done
could go out the window.

772
01:18:19,789 --> 01:18:21,745
I was invited in Washington!

773
01:18:23,247 --> 01:18:26,250
You fuck.

774
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:28,252
Pardon?

775
01:18:29,753 --> 01:18:34,758
Price goes to Washington.
Price smashes drug ring.

776
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:39,263
You don't give a shit about
anything or anybody but yourself.

777
01:18:39,763 --> 01:18:42,731
You're pathetic.

778
01:18:42,766 --> 01:18:47,271
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna drink with a friend.

779
01:18:51,775 --> 01:18:54,778
Ah, shit.

780
01:18:56,780 --> 01:19:01,535
Nobody's got any identity anymore.

781
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:06,255
Ya ever notice that?

782
01:19:06,290 --> 01:19:09,793
A bunch of gray men
walkin' around.

783
01:19:10,294 --> 01:19:14,763
No faces, no balls,

784
01:19:14,798 --> 01:19:17,301
carryin' their fuckin' lunch pails.

785
01:19:23,307 --> 01:19:26,310
Only one solution, man.

786
01:19:29,313 --> 01:19:31,799
Put on my colors, Sid.

787
01:19:34,802 --> 01:19:38,555
When you got the gun,
you walk in a room,

788
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:42,309
everybody shits in their pants.

789
01:19:44,311 --> 01:19:49,817
- Your guys won't mind.
- I can't do it, Blood.

790
01:19:58,325 --> 01:20:01,829
- Let me ask you a question.
- Shoot.

791
01:20:04,331 --> 01:20:07,334
That's a hell of an idea.

792
01:20:09,837 --> 01:20:10,838
You see?

793
01:20:11,338 --> 01:20:14,341
See what I mean?

794
01:20:14,842 --> 01:20:17,344
Gun is power.

795
01:20:17,845 --> 01:20:20,848
Power makes fear.

796
01:20:21,348 --> 01:20:25,853
And weakness only makes
your fuckin' bowels run.

797
01:20:28,355 --> 01:20:30,858
Point that somewhere else.

798
01:20:30,893 --> 01:20:33,360
You know,

799
01:20:33,861 --> 01:20:37,865
I can't remember if I put any shells
in this fuckin' thing or not.

800
01:20:55,382 --> 01:20:57,885
Fuck.

801
01:21:06,894 --> 01:21:08,896
Where the hell
did you park the car, man?

802
01:21:09,396 --> 01:21:12,900
I really don't know because
I can't see right now.

803
01:21:12,935 --> 01:21:14,902
Why don't you
open your eyes?

804
01:21:14,937 --> 01:21:16,904
Hmm?

805
01:21:17,404 --> 01:21:22,409
Open your eyes, man.
You got 'em all squinted up.

806
01:21:22,910 --> 01:21:24,912
That's a hell of an idea.

807
01:21:25,412 --> 01:21:29,416
I think what we really need
right now is the call of the wild.

808
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:31,936
- There ya go.
- Yeah.

809
01:21:31,971 --> 01:21:34,421
Wanna be...

810
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:46,398
- Is that better?
- What?

811
01:21:46,433 --> 01:21:49,937
- You can see now?
- Now wait a minute.

812
01:21:49,972 --> 01:21:51,939
Now wait a minute.

813
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,943
- You're the one that couldn't see, right ?
- No, man, it was you.

814
01:21:55,978 --> 01:21:58,445
No, no, no, no, no.

815
01:22:00,948 --> 01:22:03,951
Remember me, asshole?

816
01:22:04,451 --> 01:22:07,454
What the fuck is going on here, man?
You know this guy? Is he a friend of yours?

817
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:10,958
Our beef's not with you, man.
You can walk.

818
01:22:10,993 --> 01:22:13,961
All right.

819
01:22:15,963 --> 01:22:20,467
- Take it easy, man. - Hey, wait a
minute. Wait a minute. Blood !

820
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:22,970
You owe me something.

821
01:22:26,974 --> 01:22:28,976
Why don't you shove it?

822
01:22:35,482 --> 01:22:37,985
Uhh! Motherfucker!

823
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:45,492
Blood!

824
01:22:54,501 --> 01:22:59,006
'Fore I do ya, man,
I want you to see my face.

825
01:22:59,506 --> 01:23:01,508
Fuck you!

826
01:23:06,513 --> 01:23:10,517
Crazy, crazy son of a bitch!

827
01:23:12,019 --> 01:23:16,523
I found the car, man.

828
01:23:19,026 --> 01:23:23,030
- What'd you think I was gonna do,
leave you here? - 'Fraid so.

829
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:27,034
You ain't afraid of nothin', man.
Neither am I.

830
01:23:27,069 --> 01:23:30,037
Now let's get the fuck
outta here. Come on.

831
01:23:44,151 --> 01:23:47,654
- Renee ?
- I'm in here.

832
01:23:50,157 --> 01:23:54,126
Shut the door, shut the door!

833
01:23:54,161 --> 01:23:58,165
Come here, I wanna show you something.
Come here, hurry.

834
01:23:59,666 --> 01:24:02,634
See this?

835
01:24:02,669 --> 01:24:05,137
Your shadow didn't come in right.

836
01:24:05,172 --> 01:24:10,677
- My what? - The shadow. I had to add
some light and make you a new one.

837
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:16,183
Watch this. Here it comes.

838
01:24:24,691 --> 01:24:28,195
- Fuck.
- Amazing, isn't it?

839
01:24:29,696 --> 01:24:32,699
I gotta get the fuck outta here.

840
01:24:35,202 --> 01:24:37,204
Dan?

841
01:24:40,207 --> 01:24:43,710
Jesus, what happened to you?

842
01:24:46,213 --> 01:24:51,218
I think...
I'm losing my fucking mind.

843
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:57,724
Everything keeps happening
just like in the story.

844
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:01,228
There's no other way
to explain it.

845
01:25:02,729 --> 01:25:06,698
Dan, we gotta get outta here.

846
01:25:06,933 --> 01:25:10,937
Let's just get in the car and go.
I'll wake Marybette up. We'll just leave.

847
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:14,441
- I'm finished here.
- I can't!

848
01:25:14,476 --> 01:25:16,943
Why not?

849
01:25:20,447 --> 01:25:23,450
Blood saved my life tonight.

850
01:25:26,453 --> 01:25:31,923
- Don't you see? I can't leave now.
I have to do something. - Like what?

851
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:36,963
I don't know. Tip him off, keep him from
getting busted. He saved my life, Renee.

852
01:25:37,464 --> 01:25:42,469
- He saved Sid's life, Dan, not yours.
Can you still tell the difference?

853
01:25:42,504 --> 01:25:44,971
Can you?

854
01:25:55,982 --> 01:25:57,949
This is insane.

855
01:25:57,984 --> 01:26:02,238
I make up my mind never to care
about anybody again and here I am,

856
01:26:02,273 --> 01:26:06,493
stuck with a man who thinks he's a character
in a story who's got an appointment with death.

857
01:26:07,994 --> 01:26:10,997
Am I supposed to be learning
something from this?

858
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:17,504
And what are you learning from it, Dan?
What are you learning from this?

859
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:19,471
- Take it easy.
- No!

860
01:26:19,506 --> 01:26:23,760
When you were a little kid, your uncle
did horrible things to you. You were a victim.

861
01:26:23,795 --> 01:26:28,014
Now look what you've become. You can't
tell the knife from the fucking wound anymore!

862
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:30,517
I gotta go.

863
01:26:31,518 --> 01:26:35,021
Yeah, so do I.

864
01:26:38,024 --> 01:26:40,026
Renee, I...

865
01:27:08,555 --> 01:27:12,524
I really need to talk to
you privately.

866
01:27:12,559 --> 01:27:17,063
- Now's not a good time.
- Well, when?

867
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:19,566
Later, man, we'll talk later.

868
01:27:19,601 --> 01:27:23,069
Blood, this is really important.

869
01:27:28,074 --> 01:27:32,043
- What, are you feedin' a fuckin'
army, Oatmeal? - Bite me, man!

870
01:27:32,078 --> 01:27:35,081
Even as a little kid, I wanted more.
Understand "more"?

871
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:37,048
Ya ever want more?

872
01:27:37,083 --> 01:27:39,085
More food, more toys.

873
01:27:39,586 --> 01:27:44,055
More chicks, more little girls,
more pussy.

874
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:48,094
- You guys are gonna rob this place.
- No, we are, man.

875
01:27:48,129 --> 01:27:50,061
You're with us.

876
01:27:50,096 --> 01:27:52,599
- Hey, come on, Oatmeal.
- I said, bite me!

877
01:27:53,099 --> 01:27:56,067
- Give me the goddamn money
right now!

878
01:27:56,102 --> 01:27:59,606
- Put the goddamn gun away.
- Blood, what the fuck is with this guy?

879
01:28:04,611 --> 01:28:08,865
- You big motherfu... - Shut the fuck up!
You just stepped on your meat, man.

880
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:13,119
- Hey Blood, we gotta get the fuck outta here!
- I would've given you everything.

881
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:17,123
My house, my club,
the fuckin' shirt off my back.

882
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:20,627
Shoot the son of a bitch. - I don't know
whether he's worth savin' or not.

883
01:28:21,127 --> 01:28:24,095
Man, people can see us in here.
We gotta get the fuck out!

884
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:26,516
Everything depends on
what you do next.

885
01:28:26,517 --> 01:28:29,636
Either you ride with me
or you disappear forever.

886
01:28:29,671 --> 01:28:32,604
- You understand what I'm sayin'?
- Are you gonna smoke him or what?

887
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:38,645
- Why don't you shut the fuck up! - Yeah?
What about her? She can fuckin' identify us!

888
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:41,648
No, don't!

889
01:28:41,683 --> 01:28:43,650
Aaah!

890
01:28:46,653 --> 01:28:50,657
Now that's what we do
with damsels in distress.

891
01:29:16,683 --> 01:29:20,186
I'm so sorry.

892
01:30:00,727 --> 01:30:03,730
May I have your attention, please?

893
01:30:07,233 --> 01:30:11,738
May I have your attention, please?

894
01:30:13,418 --> 01:30:15,885
Gentlemen,

895
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:19,889
at precisely 11:00 p.m. tonight,
and continuing through dawn,

896
01:30:19,924 --> 01:30:25,446
an unprecedented number of arrests will
be made in California, Arizona and Nevada.

897
01:30:25,481 --> 01:30:29,151
These arrests will be staggered
by location and time...

898
01:30:29,354 --> 01:30:33,107
The significance of this many arrests
over such a vast area is awesome.

899
01:30:33,142 --> 01:30:36,861
It represents a substantial blow
to organized crime in Arizona,

900
01:30:36,896 --> 01:30:41,866
and it is the result
of one man's dedicated effort.

901
01:30:42,367 --> 01:30:46,621
An effort expended, I might add,
at considerable personal cost.

902
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:50,875
Now, you've all heard by now that
we've had an undercover officer...

903
01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:54,396
deep within the outlaw
motorcycle community.

904
01:30:54,431 --> 01:30:57,882
But I think you'll be surprised
when you meet him.

905
01:30:57,917 --> 01:31:01,386
In fact, I know you will be.

906
01:31:01,421 --> 01:31:04,656
His name is...

907
01:31:04,691 --> 01:31:07,892
Daniel Saxon.

908
01:31:09,394 --> 01:31:11,396
Daniel.

909
01:32:15,386 --> 01:32:18,389
- Who the fuck is it?
- Narcotics officer.

910
01:32:20,391 --> 01:32:25,896
Narcotics officer?
I love that joke.

911
01:32:27,398 --> 01:32:30,401
Come on in.

912
01:32:36,907 --> 01:32:41,412
Hiya, Sid. Guess you finally got your
priorities straightened out, huh?

913
01:32:41,447 --> 01:32:43,379
Oh, yeah.

914
01:32:43,414 --> 01:32:46,382
Makin' some eggs here.
Want some?

915
01:32:46,417 --> 01:32:49,920

Yeah?

917

What are you gonna do?

925
01:34:04,995 --> 01:34:10,501
You're under arrest, Blood,
for murder...

926
01:34:10,536 --> 01:34:12,503
and trafficking narcotics.

927

blow this door down! Now come outta here!

932
01:34:57,348 --> 01:34:59,850
- What the hell happened in there ?
- Now it's finished.

933
01:34:59,885 --> 01:35:02,353
