1
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,742
Morning, Harold.

2
00:03:53,748 --> 00:03:56,751
You're still alive?

3
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,211
You look like hell, Slick.
Have a rough night?

4
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,713
Dispatch said there were shots fired.
Crazy bastard in the rocks.

5
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,716
Chucked a couple of shots
at the dozer.

6
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,719
He almost killed me.

7
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,722
Who is he? An old Apache.

8
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:11,227
They call him Bogus Charlie.
Thinks he's a medicine man.

9
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:15,232
Says we're rapin' his mother
by pokin' holes in the earth.

10
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,736
You got any ideas?

11
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:24,241
Well, he's only shot at the dozer,
but he could change his mind.

12
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,745
I had to call in the state police.
They'll be here any minute now.

13
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,256
What the hell are you doing?

14
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,758
Takin' a walk.

15
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,761
That's fuckin' nuts.

16
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,265
Maybe.

17
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,784
Hey, Roy? You better get
the hell outta here.

18
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,794
How ya doin'?

19
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,796
Never better.

20
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,300
You know, I was thinkin'.

21
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:29,305
If you gave me that rifle and offered
to pay for the damage,

22
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:33,310
I could say you were out here hunting
and hit the equipment by mistake.

23
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,315
You want jerky?

24
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:42,818
We don't have time. The state cops
will be here in a few minutes.

25
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,322
- So if you'll just give me that rifle.
- Sit down.

26
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,325
Whatever you say.

27
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,330
You don't look so good, kid.

28
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,833
Something bothering you,
something inside, right?

29
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,336
Are you gonna give me the rifle?

30
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:04,340
You know, my grandfather
told me a story once...

31
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,843
About a young brave
who got scared of his shadow...

32
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,346
and ran away from it. Look...

33
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,349
I told you, sit still.

34
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,852
Anyway,

35
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,856
This young brave found out he was
only half a person without his shadow,

36
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,359
but to get it back...

37
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,862
he had to go down into a dark hole
where only shadows live.

38
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:30,367
Problem was,
anybody went down there...

39
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,869
never came back.

40
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,374
You've just run
out of time, old man.

41
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:42,378
If you give me the rifle right now,
we can still keep you out of jail.

42
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,381
Somethin' else
my grandfather told me...

43
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,385
a true Apache had to do
when surrounded...

44
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,887
and outnumbered by crazy white men.
What's that?

45
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,391
Give the fuck up.

46
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:09,123
So, you gonna tell me
what's bothering you?

47
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,626
Nah. I just haven't been
able to sleep much lately.

48
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:17,130
Kelly, ain't it?

49
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:19,631
I know it is. Been on you like
shit on a shovel.

50
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:24,137
- You oughta be more careful around him.
- He's an asshole.

51
00:08:24,138 --> 00:08:27,640
But he is the fucking boss.

52
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,644
There.

53
00:08:32,146 --> 00:08:35,149
- What the hell is this?
- Well, open it up, find out.

54
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,154
- You wrap this yourself, Butch?
- Sure did.

55
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:44,656
I guess I'll have to keep it,
whatever the hell it is.

56
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:48,161
I had that when I was a little kid.

57
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:51,664
Thought it might cheer you up
if you played with it for a while.

58
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:56,169
You're a very strange and crazy
old man, you know that?

59
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,671
I do. I sure know that.

60
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,675
Gotta go.

61
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:07,679
Why don't you lay out, turn
the radio off and get some rest.

62
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,681
I'll cover for you, Slick.

63
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,684
- That's what partners are for.
- Thanks, Butch.

64
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,188
Adios.

65
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:32,206
You son of a bitch.
You're just like your mother.

66
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,709
It's in your fuckin' blood!

67
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,938
Why did you stop me?

68
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,941
Why did you stop me?

69
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,943
For speeding.

70
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,946
- I wasn't speeding.
- Yes, you were.

71
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,449
- No, I wasn't.
- I'm afraid you were.

72
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,453
May I see your license, please?

73
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,312
You have a nice face.

74
00:11:03,313 --> 00:11:05,815
- Excuse me?
- Good bones.

75
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:11,821
Where you goin' in such a hurry,
miss Jackson?

76
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:14,823
- What difference does that make?
- I'll ask the questions, okay?

77
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:18,328
Okay. I'm going to the campground.

78
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:25,834
- All this photo equipment yours?
- Of course not.

79
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:28,337
That's why I'm carrying it
around with me.

80
00:11:28,338 --> 00:11:32,342
- You don't have to be a complete smart ass.
- You gonna write me a ticket?

81
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:57,367
Get outta here! Now!

82
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:05,375
This is car number 50.

83
00:12:08,378 --> 00:12:11,881
We'll take care of all the
damages, plus ten percent.

84
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:18,888
And, put a little somethin' extra
in there for you, Kelly.

85
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,393
Hoo, hoo, hoo, yeah! You did!

86
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:30,399
- I appreciate that, man, I really do.
- I know you do.

87
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,902
Now if there's anything else
we can do for ya,

88
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:36,906
anything at all. Aw, forget it.

89
00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:54,424
You're in my fuckin' way.

90
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:06,936
Who in the hell was that?

91
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:11,123
His name's Blood.
He runs that bunch.

92
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:15,627
- I got a bone to pick with you, Saxon.
- That's a surprise.

93
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,630
I heard about
what you did this morning.

94
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:23,135
Where do you get off riskin' your ass
over some worthless, drunken Indian?

95
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:28,640
- He wasn't drunk.
- All indians are nothin' but drunks, tit-head.

96
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,144
Look at me when I'm talkin' to you.

97
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,646
You fuckin'...

98
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,151
crazy, stupid son of a bitch!

99
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,654
- You're fuckin' fired.
- Bob, don't do that.

100
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,658
Shut the fuck up, Butch, or I'll fire
your ass too! Is that what you want?

101
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,661
- That's your call, sir.
- You're damn right!

102
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,664
Come on.

103
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:09,582
- Yeah?
- I'm Conroy Price, Mr. Saxon.

104
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:13,586
Special investigator of division
Arizona attorney general's office.

105
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:16,089
I have a proposition for you.

106
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,593
- Does this turtle ever move?
- What do you want, Price?

107
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:24,097
I'm forming an undercover
narcotics operation.

108
00:14:24,098 --> 00:14:29,102
- I'm lookin' for a field officer. You're the man I need.
- How do you figure that?

109
00:14:29,103 --> 00:14:32,105
I know everything
there is to know about you.

110
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:34,607
Really?

111
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:37,611
Dan Saxon isn't your real name.

112
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:43,616
You were born William Patrick Steiner
in Manhattan on June 24, 1966.

113
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:46,119
Your father was a pipe fitter.

114
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,122
Your mother was a full-blooded
chippewa Indian.

115
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:52,626
You were orphaned when you were 3 and
raised by your maternal uncle, a policeman.

116
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:59,134
Shall I go on?

117
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:01,636
Who the hell are you?

118
00:15:01,637 --> 00:15:04,639
I told you. I'm with
the attorney general's office.

119
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,143
Let me give you my card.

120
00:15:10,646 --> 00:15:14,150
I'll put it right here.
I'll go on.

121
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,652
Because she was a native american,
your uncle hated your mother.

122
00:15:17,653 --> 00:15:21,989
He locked you in a room, handcuffed you
and beat you for the next three years.

123
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,494
When you were six years old,
you somehow got his gun...

124
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:27,995
and shot him through the heart six times.

125
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:29,499
Six times.

126
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:37,506
A court-appointed psychiatrist testified you
have no memory of how it happened.

127
00:15:37,507 --> 00:15:40,509
"Severe emotional trauma,"
he called it.

128
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:44,012
You know what you did.
You just can't remember doing it.

129
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:47,014
How did you find out?

130
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:50,017
I can't tell you that,
but it was no easy task.

131
00:15:50,018 --> 00:15:53,020
The judge sealed your records
when you were adopted.

132
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:56,023
I'm curious about one thing.
Why become a policeman?

133
00:15:56,024 --> 00:15:59,026
That's a strange thing to do
under the circumstances,

134
00:15:59,027 --> 00:16:01,029
don't you think?

135
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,532
Then again, maybe not.

136
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:08,036
What I think... is you better get
the hell out of here.

137
00:16:08,037 --> 00:16:11,039
- Let me finish.
- You gonna leave or do I throw you out?

138
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,543
I can find my own way out.

139
00:16:14,544 --> 00:16:16,546
Will you think about it?

140
00:16:17,046 --> 00:16:19,047
I don't want your goddamn job.

141
00:16:19,048 --> 00:16:23,051
Maybe not. But I think you need it.

142
00:16:23,052 --> 00:16:26,554
Something tells me you have some
unfinished business with a blue uniform.

143
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:29,058
Get the fuck outta here!

144
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,563
I knew you'd change your mind.

145
00:16:35,564 --> 00:16:39,067
Well, you ever mention my past
again, I'll fuckin' kill you.

146
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:42,070
- Done.
- Where do we start?

147
00:16:42,071 --> 00:16:44,856
Here's $20,000. Sign the receipt.

148
00:16:45,358 --> 00:16:47,858
When you make a buy, I'll give you more.

149
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:50,861
Also, instructions on tagging evidence,
drop point procedures...

150
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:52,863
And some numbers
where I can be reached.

151
00:16:52,864 --> 00:16:56,368
Memorize and destroy them.
When you wanna see me, we meet here.

152
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:58,869
And nobody knows
you're undercover but me.

153
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,873
- I mean NOBODY.
- I'm gonna have to move.

154
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:07,379
I'll rent you a place in Phoenix. Grow
a mustache and change your appearance.

155
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,383
You're an ex-cop. If anybody recognizes you,
they'll kill you on spec.

156
00:17:11,384 --> 00:17:15,887
- Would you miss me, Price?
- You can forget the jokes. I have no sense of humor.

157
00:17:16,389 --> 00:17:19,890
I never have.
I tried several times to develop one.

158
00:17:19,891 --> 00:17:22,395
Even took a workshop. But it didn't work.

159
00:17:22,894 --> 00:17:26,398
- Put quite simply, nothing is funny to me.
- That's funny.

160
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:30,402
Here's a list of all the bars and
known hangouts for the drug trade.

161
00:17:30,403 --> 00:17:33,405
I want you to make yourself seen,
spend some money.

162
00:17:33,406 --> 00:17:37,908
Do whatever's necessary to get people
to trust you, short of committing a felony.

163
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:40,912
Do that and the whole operation
goes out the window.

164
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:46,917
Now before we go on, there's something I have to tell you...
- What?

165
00:17:46,918 --> 00:17:51,922
My predecessor sent two undercover
officers into Gila county last year.

166
00:17:51,923 --> 00:17:54,427
Both disappeared without a trace.

167
00:17:54,926 --> 00:17:57,430
Like they were swallowed up
by some black hole.

168
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:00,433
It's important you know
what you're up against.

169
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:37,530
Name's Virgil.

170
00:19:43,035 --> 00:19:46,538
Gonna get shit-faced if you
keep drinkin' that fast, man.

171
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:49,041
I hope so.

172
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:03,055
You know, I couldn't help but notice
how much money you're draggin' around.

173
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:05,057
I need it to buy dope.

174
00:20:05,474 --> 00:20:10,045
You know, I figured you
for a dealer right off.

175
00:20:10,046 --> 00:20:13,548
Listen... Wrong, Virgil.

176
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:16,551
I'm an undercover
narcotics officer.

177
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:21,556
Get the fuck outta here.

178
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,062
You're a narc?

179
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:38,073
Well, if you was narc...

180
00:20:38,074 --> 00:20:40,574
And I'm not sayin'
that you are...

181
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:45,080
But, if you was, you could get your ass
dusted for talkin' about it.

182
00:20:45,081 --> 00:20:48,582
Well, what the hell's the difference?
I'm a bust.

183
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,585
Nobody will sell dope
to me anyways.

184
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:55,090
That's because of the way you look, man.
I mean, look at you.

185
00:20:55,091 --> 00:20:59,094
If you came up to me and tried to buy dope,
I'd peg you for a narc.

186
00:20:59,095 --> 00:21:02,596
A minute ago, you said I
looked like a dealer.

187
00:21:02,597 --> 00:21:06,102
Fuck you, asshole.
I was trying to be polite.

188
00:21:16,611 --> 00:21:20,614
If I was a narc and I wanted to get
into some serious drugs,

189
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:22,616
I'd hang with bikers.

190
00:21:22,617 --> 00:21:26,122
Bikers control all the heavy dope.

191
00:21:32,128 --> 00:21:34,629
I don't know shit about bikers.

192
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:42,637
I could teach ya. Well, I ain't like
a member or nothin',

193
00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:45,639
but, they need me.

194
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,641
I work on their bikes.

195
00:21:47,642 --> 00:21:50,644
There ain't nothin' about a scooter
ahat I can't fix.

196
00:21:50,645 --> 00:21:55,649
Hell, when I got through with you,
you'd walk, talk and shit like a biker.

197
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,154
Why the hell would you do that?

198
00:21:59,155 --> 00:22:03,158
Listen, man.
Now this is strictly confidential.

199
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:06,161
- But I've always wanted to be cop.
- Come on.

200
00:22:06,162 --> 00:22:08,163
No, really, man.

201
00:22:08,164 --> 00:22:12,167
You know what I mean?
Carrying a fuckin' gun, arrestin' people.

202
00:22:12,168 --> 00:22:16,671
That's power. Hell, you could even
make me your deputy or somethin'.

203
00:22:17,173 --> 00:22:19,175
Couldn't you?

204
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:37,192
- Raise your right hand, Virgil.
- I do.

205
00:22:37,193 --> 00:22:40,694
Not yet, asshole.

206
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:43,697
- We got a whole ceremony to do first.
- Sorry, man.

207
00:22:43,698 --> 00:22:47,701
Do you solemnly swear
to take all of my orders...

208
00:22:47,702 --> 00:22:50,205
never shoot anybody
or carry a gun?

209
00:22:50,206 --> 00:22:53,208
- Wait a minute, man.
- No guns, Virgil.

210
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:55,211
Any shooting needs done,
I'll handle it.

211
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,712
I'm the narc.
You're the fuckin' deputy.

212
00:22:58,214 --> 00:23:02,217
That ain't fair! How can I arrest anybody
if I haven't got a gun?

213
00:23:02,218 --> 00:23:06,720
- Do you swear or not?
- Yeah, I-I-I guess so, man.

214
00:23:06,721 --> 00:23:09,225
Good.

215
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:12,726
Then it is with all
the power in my office...

216
00:23:12,727 --> 00:23:15,231
that I now pronounce you...

217
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,732
deputy sheriff.

218
00:23:19,734 --> 00:23:22,237
Man. This is somethin'.

219
00:23:22,238 --> 00:23:24,240
This is really somethin'.

220
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:28,743
- Are you sure you're a cop?
- Where do we start?

221
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:44,260
Modest beginnings start
with a single blow of a horn, man.

222
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,264
Now, when you get through
with this thing,

223
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:51,766
every dick-head in the world's
gonna wanna own it.

224
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:58,274
Do you know anything at all about
the internal combustion engine?

225
00:25:18,853 --> 00:25:21,357
There's all different
kind of bikers, man.

226
00:25:21,856 --> 00:25:25,859
And then there are Jackals.
Jackals is the fuckin' cream.

227
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,863
You don't gotta be a rocket scientist
to get close to 'em.

228
00:25:29,864 --> 00:25:33,867
They only got a few rules.
But most important is stompin'.

229
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:39,374
Stompin' means somebody hits a Jackal,
he's gonna have 30 of 'em on his neck.

230
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:42,378
A dude asks a Jackal
to get outta his house,

231
00:25:42,877 --> 00:25:47,383
he's gonna come back with an army
and stomp the bastard to death.

232
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:32,093
That is one hell of a scooter, dude.

233
00:26:32,094 --> 00:26:36,097
Climb on the fucker.
See if it works.

234
00:26:36,098 --> 00:26:38,600
- Really?
- Really.

235
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:08,630
Yes!

236
00:27:36,658 --> 00:27:40,161
Ta-da! These are
your fuckin' colors, man.

237
00:27:40,162 --> 00:27:43,664
- My fuckin' what?
- Your colors.

238
00:27:43,665 --> 00:27:47,168
A biker will fight ya to the death
if you rat-fuck his colors.

239
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:51,172
It's the name of your club.
You are a member of the Pythons.

240
00:27:51,173 --> 00:27:54,175
I made it up myself,
but who the fuck's gonna know?

241
00:27:54,176 --> 00:27:57,178
Come here, come here.

242
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:01,183
You see this little one percent?
This means that you are a member...

243
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:06,687
of the totally zoned-out, fucked-up,
bad-ass, outlaw motorcycle brotherhood.

244
00:28:06,688 --> 00:28:09,691
And this little space right here.
That's where your name goes.

245
00:28:10,192 --> 00:28:13,695
Now what do you wanna call yourself?
Bikers all got nicknames.

246
00:28:16,198 --> 00:28:20,201
How about if I call myself... Sid?

247
00:28:20,202 --> 00:28:22,703
- Sid. Sidney?
- Yeah. Sid.

248
00:28:22,704 --> 00:28:26,207
- Not fuckin' Sidney. Sid.
- Sid. Sid. Sid.

249
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:30,212
I like it. It's great. Fuckin' great.
Here. Put it on. Try it on.

250
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:40,221
- Nope, nope.
- What?

251
00:28:40,222 --> 00:28:43,224
Well, you're not dirty enough.
You're not crazy enough.

252
00:28:43,225 --> 00:28:45,726
I'm gettin' really fuckin' tired
of hearing you say that.

253
00:28:45,727 --> 00:28:50,732
Yeah? Well, being tired
is a lot better than being dead, man.

254
00:28:51,233 --> 00:28:54,236
I just made that up too.

255
00:29:00,742 --> 00:29:03,244
What the fuck...

256
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:06,747
Now you're dirty enough.

257
00:29:06,748 --> 00:29:10,752
Meet me tomorrow at Spanish Wells and
we'll see how fuckin' crazy you are.

258
00:29:12,754 --> 00:29:14,755
You son of a bitch.

259
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:17,258
Base to 528.

260
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:19,760
All units, '89 red cadillac seville,

261
00:29:19,761 --> 00:29:22,763
partial plate I.D. number 7-2-6,

262
00:29:22,764 --> 00:29:27,269
just reported stolen from Denny's
parking lot in Linkville.

263
00:29:31,773 --> 00:29:35,777
Hello, dude. What do ya think
of my new wheels?

264
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:38,780
You ugly prick!

265
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:46,788
You just stole this car from the
Denny's parking lot in Linkville.

266
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:49,790
How in the fuck
did you know that, man?

267
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:53,794
- You've involved me in a felony, Virgil.
- I was getting bored.

268
00:29:53,795 --> 00:29:57,799
Bein' a cop ain't everything I thought it was gonna be.
- What's that in your belt?

269
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,303
- Nothing.
- Bullshit! It's a pistol. You swore no guns.

270
00:30:02,304 --> 00:30:05,306
Now take it out
and put it on the seat.

271
00:30:05,307 --> 00:30:08,309
- I was just tryin' to have a little fun, man.
- Fun?

272
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:11,312
I oughta kill you!
Now follow me back down the hill...

273
00:30:11,313 --> 00:30:15,317
so we can dump this piece of shit
before somebody catches us.

274
00:31:11,873 --> 00:31:13,875
Shit!

275
00:31:25,387 --> 00:31:28,390
Wanna play, asshole?

276
00:31:31,393 --> 00:31:33,395
Holy shit, man!

277
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:41,903
Holy shit, man!
Jesus Christ all fucking mighty!

278
00:31:44,406 --> 00:31:46,907
God!

279
00:31:46,908 --> 00:31:50,912
You're crazy enough now, dude.

280
00:31:51,213 --> 00:31:53,780
You're definitely crazy enough.

281
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:58,287
So get your shit together.
We are going to a fucking wedding.

282
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:19,894
Don't talk too much today. If somebody
gives you a dare, you gotta take it.

283
00:34:20,395 --> 00:34:24,399
This is serious. This isn't a game.
You fuck up, they're gonna kill ya.

284
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,422
So I pick up the fuckin' Hammer,

285
00:34:48,423 --> 00:34:51,926
and the guy says, "you're not gonna
hit me with that, are ya?"

286
00:34:53,928 --> 00:34:57,932
So I say, "no way, man.
I'm gonna brain your fuckin' wife."

287
00:35:02,437 --> 00:35:05,439
Oatmeal. How's your head, man?

288
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,941
How the fuck would I know, dildo?

289
00:35:07,942 --> 00:35:13,447
The last contact I had with my head
was six fuckin' years ago.

290
00:35:13,448 --> 00:35:17,952
- What the fuck are you supposed to be?
- This is Sid, man.

291
00:35:21,956 --> 00:35:24,958
What's it say on your jacket there, Sid?

292
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:28,462
Pythons?
From Cleveland, fuckin' Ohio?

293
00:35:28,463 --> 00:35:33,468
Sid, this is Oatmeal. Oatmeal's got
the biggest testicles in Arizona.

294
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:40,474
- Wanna crank up the ol' noggin, Sid?
- I'll do it. Thanks.

295
00:35:40,475 --> 00:35:43,477
So, Sid...

296
00:35:43,478 --> 00:35:47,981
what kind of games do they
play in Cleveland, Ohio?

297
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:52,486
Guns, man.
We like to play with guns.

298
00:35:52,487 --> 00:35:54,489
You boys got any guns?

299
00:35:59,044 --> 00:36:02,046
Yeah, I guess we got some guns.

300
00:36:02,047 --> 00:36:05,049
Pick yourself out one.
We'll shoot some cans.

301
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,052
Or somethin'. You got any money?

302
00:36:08,053 --> 00:36:11,555
Has he got any money?
Jesus Christ. Is the pope a Cadillac?

303
00:36:13,557 --> 00:36:17,062
Well, you ain't gonna have it long, Slick.

304
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:27,072
Your turn.

305
00:36:32,576 --> 00:36:35,079
Who is that?

306
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,082
Some kind of writer
doin' a book on bikers.

307
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:41,086
Name's Renee, man.
Don't pay no fuckin' attention to her.

308
00:36:41,585 --> 00:36:43,586
- Go ahead and shoot.
- Come on, Sid.

309
00:36:43,587 --> 00:36:48,093
We ain't got all fuckin' day.

310
00:36:49,593 --> 00:36:53,098
- You missed.
- Wrong.

311
00:36:53,597 --> 00:36:58,102
Bullshit, man.
You fuckin' hit a can, it fuckin' moves.

312
00:36:58,103 --> 00:37:01,604
- You callin' me a liar?
- I'm callin' you worse than a liar.

313
00:37:01,605 --> 00:37:05,609
I'm sayin' the Pythons
are a sissy-ass club.

314
00:37:06,111 --> 00:37:09,613
And you are a chicken-shit
dog motherfucker.

315
00:37:13,617 --> 00:37:16,620
- What the fuck you doin', man?
- I'm gonna try again, Oatmeal.

316
00:37:17,122 --> 00:37:19,623
I wanna make sure
the can moves this time.

317
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:22,127
Geez, what, are you fuckin' nuts?

318
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:40,144
Stupid son of a bitch.
I'm gonna kill ya!

319
00:37:40,145 --> 00:37:43,148
Who the fuck you gonna kill now,
blubber guts? Aw, Jesus.

320
00:37:43,647 --> 00:37:46,649
Who? I didn't mean nothin', man.

321
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:49,653
- Okay, who set off the fuckin' dynamite?
- I did.

322
00:37:50,155 --> 00:37:52,656
It was just a...
Virgil, shut your mouth.

323
00:37:53,158 --> 00:37:56,160
- Who the fuck are you?
- His name's Sid, man.

324
00:37:56,161 --> 00:37:59,163
- What the fuck did I just say to you?
- Shut up.

325
00:37:59,164 --> 00:38:01,165
- Absolutely.
- What's goin' on, Sid?

326
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:04,667
- You rat-fucked my colors.
- Hey, I was just screwin' around.

327
00:38:04,668 --> 00:38:06,670
Get him to back off, Blood.

328
00:38:07,172 --> 00:38:09,673
What are you gonna do?

329
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,681
I think I'm gonna shoot him.

330
00:38:18,183 --> 00:38:22,186
Aw, geez. Aw, man,
I didn't mean anything. Please.

331
00:38:22,187 --> 00:38:26,190
Jesus, please.
Dirt, get her outta here.

332
00:38:26,191 --> 00:38:29,692
Goddamn it, I didn't mean anything.
Come on, give me a break.

333
00:38:29,693 --> 00:38:32,196
Fuck! Jesus H. Christ!

334
00:38:32,197 --> 00:38:36,200
You shoot him and I'll blow your
motherfuckin' brains out.

335
00:38:36,201 --> 00:38:38,202
Nobody lives forever.

336
00:38:38,203 --> 00:38:41,206
That's a fact.
Now shoot the fucker.

337
00:38:41,705 --> 00:38:43,706
Jesus, I was just...

338
00:38:43,707 --> 00:38:48,213
I was just foolin' around.
I'll kiss your fuckin' colors.

339
00:38:48,712 --> 00:38:52,715
I like your colors. I love your fuckin'
colors. Your colors are wonderful.

340
00:38:52,716 --> 00:38:55,719
Geez, I'm peein' here!

341
00:39:04,229 --> 00:39:08,233
Hey, this is supposed to be a wedding here.
Now, where's the goddamn bride?

342
00:39:21,745 --> 00:39:27,750
All right, we all came out here today
so Bubbles and Highside here can get married.

343
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:32,257
I want all you fuckin' assholes
to show a little bit of respect.

344
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:40,764
Do you, Bubbles, swear on this bible
you wanna let this...

345
00:39:41,266 --> 00:39:43,766
smelly old scuzball, Highside,

346
00:39:43,767 --> 00:39:46,770
lubricate your cylinder and...
Don't do it!

347
00:39:47,272 --> 00:39:49,273
Flush out your oil tank?

348
00:39:49,274 --> 00:39:51,275
I do.

349
00:39:51,276 --> 00:39:55,280
Do you, Highside, wanna let
this ugly old bag...

350
00:39:55,779 --> 00:39:59,782
handle your great big rod and little roller
bearings in the decidedly up-and-down fashion?

351
00:39:59,783 --> 00:40:03,787
Yeah, what the fuck.
Give the broad some tongue.

352
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:37,322
We got a very unusual
situation here, Sid.

353
00:40:40,325 --> 00:40:43,328
Hey, Blood. How you doin'?

354
00:40:44,828 --> 00:40:49,833
Anybody pulls down on my family,
they usually end up dead.

355
00:40:50,335 --> 00:40:54,339
But Oatmeal shit
on your colors and...

356
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:56,840
I like loyalty.

357
00:41:00,345 --> 00:41:03,847
So in your case,
I guess I made an exception.

358
00:41:07,851 --> 00:41:10,354
- I know you from somewhere, don't I?
- I don't think so.

359
00:41:10,355 --> 00:41:12,356
No?

360
00:41:12,357 --> 00:41:14,359
Trust me.

361
00:41:18,363 --> 00:41:21,366
If you met me before,
you wouldn't fuckin' forget it.

362
00:41:23,867 --> 00:41:28,372
Look, man,
I wanna move some contraband.

363
00:41:28,373 --> 00:41:31,376
Buy it here, sell it in the midwest
and people say I gotta deal with you.

364
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:35,380
Is that right?
What people is that, I wonder?

365
00:41:35,879 --> 00:41:38,882
You mean I got itallwrong?

366
00:41:42,387 --> 00:41:45,389
Sid...

367
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:49,393
You're either the dumbest fucker
I ever met in my life or...

368
00:41:49,394 --> 00:41:52,396
you got the balls of an elephant.

369
00:41:52,397 --> 00:41:54,897
Which one is it?

370
00:41:54,898 --> 00:41:57,900
You choose.

371
00:41:57,901 --> 00:42:00,404
Well, that's exactly what I'm gonna do,

372
00:42:00,405 --> 00:42:03,408
hotshot.

373
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,134
So dry.

374
00:42:48,635 --> 00:42:51,638
One of these days, it has to rain.

375
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,144
When it rains in the desert,
it's like...

376
00:42:57,145 --> 00:43:00,148
everything starts all over again.

377
00:43:02,649 --> 00:43:04,651
You still a cop?

378
00:43:08,156 --> 00:43:10,158
You are, aren't you?

379
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,163
Don't worry.
They won't recognize you.

380
00:43:16,164 --> 00:43:18,664
You don't look anything
like you used to.

381
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:20,666
It's still a nice face.

382
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:24,671
Do you have any idea
what would happen if they found out?

383
00:43:29,743 --> 00:43:32,828
What you're doing is very dangerous.
You know that?

384
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:36,333
- Is it?
- Never mind.

385
00:43:36,334 --> 00:43:38,336
None of my business.

386
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:46,344
One piece of advice.
Don't underestimate Blood.

387
00:43:46,843 --> 00:43:49,846
He's smart. He'll kill you
without a second thought.

388
00:43:51,848 --> 00:43:53,850
Where are ya goin'?

389
00:43:55,353 --> 00:43:57,354
Home.

390
00:43:57,355 --> 00:43:59,357
Can I give ya a lift?

391
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,861
I don't think so. I'm strictly
a solo act these days.

392
00:44:06,863 --> 00:44:09,865
Besides, don't take it personally,

393
00:44:09,866 --> 00:44:12,869
but I don't think you have
much of a future.

394
00:44:47,904 --> 00:44:51,409
Sid?

395
00:44:51,908 --> 00:44:54,910
See that place
across the street?

396
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:58,416
Big-time redneck bar.

397
00:44:58,915 --> 00:45:01,918
Those fuckin' guys
hate bikers, man.

398
00:45:03,421 --> 00:45:06,922
I got 50 bucks says
you ain't got balls big enough...

399
00:45:06,923 --> 00:45:10,427
to ride your sled
through the front door.

400
00:45:10,428 --> 00:45:13,929
- Man, that's suicide.
- Shut up, dildo.

401
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:16,932
No big deal.
I hate rednecks almost as much...

402
00:45:16,933 --> 00:45:19,437
as guys who piss themselves.

403
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:37,954
- What do you think? Is he gonna do it?
- I don't know, man.

404
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,302
Anybody got a light?

405
00:46:45,356 --> 00:46:47,858
What's up, Blood?

406
00:47:05,876 --> 00:47:09,379
- How many guys in the Pythons, Sid?
- Enough.

407
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:12,882
I think I've heard of you guys before.
Pythons.

408
00:47:12,883 --> 00:47:16,386
Yeah, I've heard of you guys before.
Pythons are cool.

409
00:47:16,387 --> 00:47:18,888
Jackals is better.

410
00:47:18,889 --> 00:47:22,892
- Wanna be a Jackal, Sid?
- I got my own club.

411
00:47:22,893 --> 00:47:27,398
You wanna talk business or are
we gonna kiss each other all day?

412
00:47:32,903 --> 00:47:37,407
- Now what do you wanna buy?
- What's for sale?

413
00:47:37,408 --> 00:47:39,910
Tell 'im, Dirt.

414
00:47:40,411 --> 00:47:42,912
Everything, man.

415
00:47:42,913 --> 00:47:44,914
Ludes, trees, grass,

416
00:47:44,915 --> 00:47:46,917
stars, crank.

417
00:47:47,418 --> 00:47:49,919
- We got labs makin' the shit.
- What about guns?

418
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,422
Any fuckin' thing you want.

419
00:47:52,423 --> 00:47:56,427
Pogo sticks, foreign jobs.
You want a goddamn rocket launcher,

420
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,928
we can get it.

421
00:47:58,929 --> 00:48:01,431
Dirt will show you
around tomorrow, but,

422
00:48:01,432 --> 00:48:04,934
'til then, I know where there's a party.

423
00:48:04,935 --> 00:48:09,439
And wherever there's a party,
there's a lot of cooze.

424
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,442
What do ya say, Sid?

425
00:48:16,947 --> 00:48:19,449
You can forget all about that.
Everybody I know has tried.

426
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:23,453
She paid Blood $5,000
to take pictures of the Jackals.

427
00:48:23,454 --> 00:48:26,956
- Blood's gonna be famous.
- Shut up!

428
00:48:26,957 --> 00:48:29,459
Don't say anything,
don't do anything.

429
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,463
Just fuckin' sit there.

430
00:48:37,968 --> 00:48:40,471
Let's get the fuck outta here.

431
00:49:08,848 --> 00:49:11,352
You're a real good pool player, man.

432
00:49:11,851 --> 00:49:16,356
- You wanna make a little wager?
- Ya mean like a bet?

433
00:49:16,357 --> 00:49:19,858
Only thing is I'm not gonna be
doin' the actual playing.

434
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:23,363
- I'm just gonna bet.
- Who's gonna play?

435
00:49:23,364 --> 00:49:25,864
She is.

436
00:49:25,865 --> 00:49:29,369
You ain't gonna play me?
The broad is?

437
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:31,372
She's gonna play both of you.

438
00:49:31,871 --> 00:49:33,374
- Both of them?
- Right.

439
00:49:35,376 --> 00:49:39,380
- How much?
- Fifty bucks.

440
00:50:43,576 --> 00:50:47,080
You lose, lady.

441
00:50:47,081 --> 00:50:49,581
You just scratched. We win.

442
00:50:49,582 --> 00:50:52,585
- Better not touch that money.
- Why not?

443
00:50:54,088 --> 00:50:58,590
'Cause my friend here
will beat the crap outta you.

444
00:50:58,591 --> 00:51:02,595
- Both of you.
- Both of them?

445
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:07,599
You heard her, man.

446
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:12,106
Get off that stool. Or ain't you
got no hair on your cute little ass?

447
00:51:13,606 --> 00:51:15,608
Jesus!

448
00:51:24,617 --> 00:51:29,123
- How we doing?
- Can you gimme a hand here for Christ's sake?

449
00:53:39,253 --> 00:53:41,754
I can hear your heart beat.

450
00:53:42,256 --> 00:53:45,259
Let me know if it stops, will ya?

451
00:53:50,264 --> 00:53:52,765
You like Indians?

452
00:53:53,033 --> 00:53:55,601
They have amazing eyes, don't they?

453
00:53:55,602 --> 00:53:59,106
Like they're looking right through you.

454
00:54:05,112 --> 00:54:08,114
So what are you doin' tomorrow?

455
00:54:08,115 --> 00:54:10,117
What time is it?

456
00:54:11,618 --> 00:54:14,120
It's only 7:30.

457
00:54:14,121 --> 00:54:16,123
You have to go.

458
00:54:16,623 --> 00:54:19,626
Are you expecting somebody?

459
00:54:21,628 --> 00:54:25,132
No, I...
I have to pick up my little girl.

460
00:54:25,632 --> 00:54:28,635
Okay. I'll wait here.

461
00:54:29,136 --> 00:54:32,639
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- What's her name?

462
00:54:38,145 --> 00:54:40,646
Marybette. She's six.

463
00:54:40,647 --> 00:54:44,150
She's my... Look,
I don't want this to be a problem,

464
00:54:44,151 --> 00:54:48,654
but I think you should go.
There isn't gonna be any problem, Renee.

465
00:54:48,655 --> 00:54:53,159
You've got a six-year-old daughter
named Marybette, and I wanna meet her.

466
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,663
How long until you get back?

467
00:54:57,664 --> 00:55:01,168
- I'll be back in half an hour.
- I'll be here.

468
00:55:03,903 --> 00:55:07,907
The shower's down the hall.
There's coffee in the kitchen.

469
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:11,910
Half an hour?

470
00:55:11,911 --> 00:55:14,914
Get outta here.

471
00:55:40,441 --> 00:55:42,942
Marybette, she's six.

472
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:53,953
When you were six.

473
00:56:10,471 --> 00:56:12,472
What are you doing?

474
00:56:12,473 --> 00:56:14,973
I am creating something.

475
00:56:14,974 --> 00:56:19,480
- What is it?
- It's a mess.

476
00:56:21,482 --> 00:56:26,486
No, it is not a mess.
It is an old, secret recipe...

477
00:56:26,487 --> 00:56:28,988
that is no longer a secret.

478
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:33,493
Now we have zee
vanilla ice cream.

479
00:56:33,494 --> 00:56:37,997
And we have zee
melted peanut better and grape juice.

480
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,505
And a personal favorite of mine.

481
00:56:46,507 --> 00:56:48,509
Come here.

482
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:53,514
Pick a hand.

483
00:56:56,015 --> 00:56:58,518
Oreo cookies.

484
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:02,021
But... I prefer them crushed.

485
00:57:04,525 --> 00:57:06,527
We pour the crushed oreos...

486
00:57:07,026 --> 00:57:10,030
into the melted peanut butter,

487
00:57:10,531 --> 00:57:13,534
and we continue to crush them.

488
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:22,041
Do not overcrush.

489
00:57:22,042 --> 00:57:25,545
Now, voila!

490
00:57:25,546 --> 00:57:27,547
Madame would like a taste?

491
00:57:27,548 --> 00:57:30,550
- You're insane.
- I want some.

492
00:57:35,688 --> 00:57:38,774
Would you prefer smoking
or non-smoking?

493
00:57:38,775 --> 00:57:40,777
What do you think?

494
00:57:41,278 --> 00:57:43,780
Non-smoking.

495
00:58:00,297 --> 00:58:02,299
This is good.

496
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:36,892
What, is somethin' botherin' you, Virgil?

497
00:59:36,893 --> 00:59:41,897
Fuckin' Oatmeal, man,
keeps callin' me a dildo and shit.

498
00:59:41,898 --> 00:59:46,902
I hate it when
them guys call me that.

499
00:59:46,903 --> 00:59:51,408
I might be a lot of things,
man, but I ain't no fuckin' dildo.

500
00:59:56,913 --> 00:59:59,916
What exactly is a dildo, anyway?

501
01:00:02,419 --> 01:00:06,422
Relax, Virgil.
It's just a term of endearment.

502
01:00:06,423 --> 01:00:09,425
- A what?
- Let's get outta here.

503
01:00:09,426 --> 01:00:14,431
Hey, Sid. Heh, get your ass
up here, man. Come on.

504
01:00:20,937 --> 01:00:26,442
Now, Waldo, this individual that you see
before you is the man I've been talkin' about.

505
01:00:26,443 --> 01:00:29,945
How many months we been
workin' together? Two, three?

506
01:00:29,946 --> 01:00:31,947
Who counts?

507
01:00:31,948 --> 01:00:35,951
Man, I do. I count everything.

508
01:00:35,952 --> 01:00:39,956
By my count, we been doin'
pretty well together.

509
01:00:42,459 --> 01:00:47,463
Makin' lots of money,
get along pretty good.

510
01:00:47,464 --> 01:00:52,969
But that's not what I'm talkin' about
and that's not why I'm sayin' all this.

511
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:57,974
It's because, I like you, man.

512
01:01:00,477 --> 01:01:02,478
I look at you, I see me.

513
01:01:02,479 --> 01:01:07,483
You know, you're smart,
don't take shit from anybody.

514
01:01:07,484 --> 01:01:09,985
I like that.

515
01:01:09,986 --> 01:01:13,990
Except I think you got,
one small problem.

516
01:01:14,491 --> 01:01:18,494
You got your priorities
all fucked up.

517
01:01:18,495 --> 01:01:22,498
You know, maybe like you're
a little bit, confused.

518
01:01:22,499 --> 01:01:25,000
Confused about what?

519
01:01:25,001 --> 01:01:28,505
I think you got this thing
about weakness,

520
01:01:29,005 --> 01:01:32,007
about feelin' sorry for weak people.

521
01:01:32,008 --> 01:01:35,010
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
hangin' around with that freak.

522
01:01:35,011 --> 01:01:40,015
Feelin' sorry for anybody
is a complete fuckin' waste of time.

523
01:01:40,016 --> 01:01:42,519
But you do it.

524
01:01:44,521 --> 01:01:47,523
I mean, man, what are you,
some kind of a...

525
01:01:47,524 --> 01:01:51,528
knight in shining armor
lookin' for damsels in distress?

526
01:01:55,032 --> 01:01:59,036
Ordinarily, I don't do this
because,

527
01:01:59,536 --> 01:02:04,041
you know, I'm the president and I don't sponsor
anybody as I didn't think it was right.

528
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:10,546
But, I wanna sponsor you
for the Jackals.

529
01:02:10,547 --> 01:02:12,549
What do ya say?

530
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:19,056
Let me think about it.

531
01:02:20,556 --> 01:02:22,558
Excuse me?

532
01:02:22,808 --> 01:02:25,394
Let me think about it.
Let me give it some thought.

533
01:02:25,395 --> 01:02:28,397
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

534
01:02:28,398 --> 01:02:33,402
Listen man, I got my own club.
Lotta guys depend on me.

535
01:02:33,403 --> 01:02:36,683
Now, what kind of a prick would I be if I
turned on 'em the first time somethin'...

536
01:02:36,906 --> 01:02:38,907
different and better came along,

537
01:02:38,908 --> 01:02:41,911
- Hey, Sid.
- Gimme that, man.

538
01:02:42,412 --> 01:02:45,414
Hey! What the fuck is your problem?

539
01:02:45,415 --> 01:02:48,418
Every time somebody offers Sid
some nose candy, you end up with it.

540
01:02:48,918 --> 01:02:50,919
Now, why is that?

541
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:55,925
What the fuck's wrong with you?
You can't get high with your friends?

542
01:03:38,968 --> 01:03:41,971
There is no way
you can join the Jackals.

543
01:03:42,472 --> 01:03:45,974
You have to commit a felony in front of
two members. It's in their bylaws.

544
01:03:45,975 --> 01:03:49,978
Use your head, Daniel. You're supposed to be a cop.
- Is that it?

545
01:03:49,979 --> 01:03:54,483
- For a second, I almost forgot.
- God, I hate this weather.

546
01:03:54,484 --> 01:03:57,987
Doesn't it ever rain?

547
01:04:01,491 --> 01:04:06,495
- Okay. What's the matter?
- Nothin'.

548
01:04:06,496 --> 01:04:09,998
Look, we've only been
at this a short time...

549
01:04:09,999 --> 01:04:13,001
and we've succeeded beyond
anyone's expectations.

550
01:04:13,002 --> 01:04:18,006
We've logged over
300 pieces of evidence.

551
01:04:18,007 --> 01:04:23,012
Daniel, the director of the FBI
called me yesterday.

552
01:04:23,513 --> 01:04:28,016
Me, personally. I couldn't believe it...
That's great, Price.

553
01:04:28,017 --> 01:04:30,520
I'm really thrilled for ya.

554
01:04:42,532 --> 01:04:45,534
You've got a shell
around you a mile thick.

555
01:04:45,535 --> 01:04:50,039
Now, you're gonna have to open up
to somebody. It might as well be me.

556
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,541
Now, if I can talk...
Fuck you, man! I don't wanna talk to you.

557
01:04:52,542 --> 01:04:56,546
- I'm not even sure If I like you!
- Hold on!

558
01:05:02,551 --> 01:05:06,554
- Next week is San Carlos run.
- Yeah.

559
01:05:06,555 --> 01:05:11,559
Our calculation is that over 50
motorcycle gangs will be involved.

560
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,562
What's your point?

561
01:05:16,066 --> 01:05:19,567
The FBI wants you to take one of their
agents in undercover... No fuckin' way!

562
01:05:19,568 --> 01:05:22,488
They have an experienced officer
they feel can pass... Too dangerous!

563
01:05:22,571 --> 01:05:25,573
- There'll be 20 more state cops in marked cars...
- I won't do it, goddamn it!

564
01:05:25,574 --> 01:05:30,579
FBI wants to send somebody in, you let 'em.
But he'll fuck up and they'll kill him!

565
01:05:31,081 --> 01:05:34,582
And then you can call the director
of the FBI and tell him about it.

566
01:05:34,583 --> 01:05:38,587
You can call him, Price, personally.

567
01:05:45,095 --> 01:05:48,097
I'm not going to San Carlos today.

568
01:05:48,098 --> 01:05:51,101
I need to catch up in the darkroom.

569
01:05:55,105 --> 01:05:57,606
Do you remember
what happened last night?

570
01:05:59,608 --> 01:06:02,610
You had a nightmare.

571
01:06:02,611 --> 01:06:06,115
I woke up,
you were crying like a little kid...

572
01:06:06,116 --> 01:06:09,119
begging somebody
to stop hitting you.

573
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:14,622
I held you for a while.
I thought you woke up, but...

574
01:06:14,623 --> 01:06:19,128
you looked at me and you said,

575
01:06:19,129 --> 01:06:23,133
"take the, the handcuffs off."

576
01:06:26,136 --> 01:06:28,637
Jesus.

577
01:06:36,146 --> 01:06:39,647
I'm almost finished here, Dan.
I have all the pictures I need.

578
01:06:39,648 --> 01:06:43,651
I'm gonna write the story in L.A.

579
01:06:43,652 --> 01:06:46,156
That's good.

580
01:06:48,158 --> 01:06:53,163
Have you... thought about what
you're gonna do after this?

581
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:58,666
I thought...
Maybe we could make...

582
01:06:58,667 --> 01:07:04,174
peanut butter and grape juice drinks
for the next few years.

583
01:07:05,674 --> 01:07:08,177
I'm really scared.

584
01:07:08,178 --> 01:07:12,182
Renee, don't worry. I'm okay.

585
01:07:13,682 --> 01:07:16,685
I gotta go.

586
01:07:28,198 --> 01:07:31,700
I really am... I'm okay.

587
01:07:36,705 --> 01:07:39,708
I don't think so.

588
01:12:01,753 --> 01:12:03,754
Where'd you get your scooter at?

589
01:12:03,755 --> 01:12:05,756
- Get your fuckin' hands off me!
- Lyin' motherfuckin' cocksucker!

590
01:12:05,757 --> 01:12:09,577
- I'll kill ya!
- That belongs to a brother of mine!

591
01:12:09,578 --> 01:12:12,580
Piece of shit! You know what you are?
You're a fuckin' pig!

592
01:12:12,581 --> 01:12:15,583
Pig-sticker motherfucker,
that's what you are!

593
01:12:15,584 --> 01:12:18,086
Highside, what the fuck
is going on over here?

594
01:12:18,087 --> 01:12:22,090
This worthless piece of shit's
a fuckin' cop.

595
01:12:22,091 --> 01:12:26,595
I know this scooter. It belonged to a brother
of mine. FBI confiscated it months ago.

596
01:12:28,097 --> 01:12:32,101
Kill the bastard!

597
01:12:38,107 --> 01:12:40,609
They made him. Let's move!

598
01:13:43,672 --> 01:13:47,675
- The fuck are you lookin' at, pig?
- Take it easy, friend.

599
01:13:47,676 --> 01:13:51,679
- We don't want anybody to get hurt.
- Then get the fuck outta my face!

600
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:55,184
And take the rest
of these pigs with you.

601
01:14:34,223 --> 01:14:37,225
Damn, Sid, you were really
out there, brother.

602
01:14:37,226 --> 01:14:40,228
- I hate cops, Blood.
- Hey, me too.

603
01:14:40,229 --> 01:14:44,232
I hate 'em more than anything.

604
01:14:44,233 --> 01:14:49,737
Some of those undercover guys
are pretty clever.

605
01:14:49,738 --> 01:14:52,741
You ever get conned by one?

606
01:14:58,247 --> 01:15:02,251
I can smell a cop
a hundred miles away, man.

607
01:15:10,759 --> 01:15:14,262
Holy shit, man,
you got balls that clank.

608
01:15:14,263 --> 01:15:17,266
You get some kinda kick outta
pushin' like that?

609
01:15:20,269 --> 01:15:24,272
I met a couple of dudes from the Dusters, man.
Gonna sell us some heroin on the way back.

610
01:15:24,273 --> 01:15:28,777
How much?... That's the interesting part.
As much as we fuckin' want.

611
01:15:29,278 --> 01:15:31,280
- We're gonna need some wheels though.
- Done.

612
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:34,283
Psycho-fucking-delic!

613
01:15:39,288 --> 01:15:44,292
Thirty grand, on the button. Listen, man,
can you give us a lift back to town?

614
01:15:44,293 --> 01:15:48,296
I wanna leave my truck here.
No, man, we're goin' the other way.

615
01:15:48,297 --> 01:15:51,800
Yeah, we'll take ya. Get in.

616
01:16:18,827 --> 01:16:22,330
Hey, man, can't you wait?

617
01:16:22,331 --> 01:16:28,337
Who the fuck waits, man? Commuters
wait for trains. I don't wait for nobody.

618
01:16:40,349 --> 01:16:42,850
Do you want a fix first?

619
01:16:42,851 --> 01:16:48,357
No, man, he's safety conscious.
You know, like, do not geeze and drive.

620
01:17:04,373 --> 01:17:08,376
- Who do you know in Cleveland, man?
- None of your fuckin' business.

621
01:17:08,377 --> 01:17:10,879
My fuckin' business?

622
01:17:27,896 --> 01:17:31,399
What fuckin' street do you
live on in Cleveland, man?

623
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,902
Fuck you!

624
01:17:35,404 --> 01:17:37,406
Hey, goddamn it, man!

625
01:18:08,437 --> 01:18:10,938
Kick your fuckin' ass!

626
01:18:10,939 --> 01:18:13,941
What are you doin'?

627
01:18:13,942 --> 01:18:16,945
Goddamn it, man!

628
01:18:18,447 --> 01:18:21,450
Cut it out! Now!

629
01:18:25,954 --> 01:18:30,458
I got an idea.
Let's shoot each other.

630
01:18:30,459 --> 01:18:33,462
You go first. Holy Jesus, man!

631
01:18:35,464 --> 01:18:38,467
You're crazy.

632
01:18:57,986 --> 01:19:00,989
Let's get the hell outta here.

633
01:19:04,993 --> 01:19:09,498
- Get in the car, Virgil.
- I don't think so, man. This is where Virgil gets off.

634
01:19:09,998 --> 01:19:15,002
- What are you talkin' about?
- You man, that's what the fuck I'm talkin' about!

635
01:19:15,003 --> 01:19:19,006
- I mean, look at this shit.
- You're fuckin' nuts!

636
01:19:19,007 --> 01:19:23,511
If you ever was a cop,
you ain't a cop anymore.

637
01:19:23,512 --> 01:19:26,515
I mean, no fuckin' cop in the
world does shit like that!

638
01:19:30,519 --> 01:19:35,023
Here, man, you get yourself a new deputy.
I just can't keep up with you no more.

639
01:19:40,028 --> 01:19:42,031
Okay.

640
01:19:44,033 --> 01:19:47,036
I'll see you around...

641
01:19:49,538 --> 01:19:51,540
dildo.

642
01:20:18,067 --> 01:20:21,070
Shit.

643
01:20:34,582 --> 01:20:40,089
Get your hands in the air and get
out of the car. Come on, move!

644
01:20:42,091 --> 01:20:45,592
All right, now, you turn around.
Do it!

645
01:20:45,593 --> 01:20:52,100
Lock your hands behind your head.
You stay right there, asshole.

646
01:20:52,101 --> 01:20:55,103
- Gimme your hands.
- Take it easy.

647
01:20:55,104 --> 01:20:57,605
You got any kinda I.D.

648
01:20:58,107 --> 01:21:03,112
What'd you do?
You got born, birdbrain!

649
01:21:05,613 --> 01:21:07,614
You gotta gimme a phone call.

650
01:21:07,615 --> 01:21:11,619
- You'll get one when I get around to it!
- Heh-heh!

651
01:21:12,121 --> 01:21:15,623
- You gotta give me a fuckin' phone call!
- Sit down, kid.

652
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:19,128
There's nothin' you can do.

653
01:21:23,631 --> 01:21:26,633
Charlie?

654
01:21:26,634 --> 01:21:29,637
Bogus Charlie?

655
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:33,641
I know you?

656
01:21:34,143 --> 01:21:38,147
You told me a story about an Indian
who ran away from his shadow, remember?

657
01:21:38,646 --> 01:21:42,151
Yeah.
You don't look like the same...

658
01:21:42,650 --> 01:21:46,653
Why did you tell me that?
Why did you tell me that?

659
01:21:46,654 --> 01:21:50,658
I don't know.
Jesus Christ, you're chokin' me!

660
01:21:52,161 --> 01:21:54,662
I'm sorry.

661
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,003
The Indian in the story,
what happens to him?

662
01:22:05,006 --> 01:22:09,009
He goes down into his hole
and finds his shadow.

663
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:11,512
A moon woman
sews it back on for him.

664
01:22:11,513 --> 01:22:17,017
But before he can climb
back out he has to meet...

665
01:22:17,018 --> 01:22:18,519
Who?

666
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:22,023
- Look, kid, it's just a story...
- Who does he have to meet?

667
01:22:24,025 --> 01:22:26,027
Death.

668
01:22:29,031 --> 01:22:31,532
I gotta get the fuck outta here.

669
01:22:31,533 --> 01:22:36,037
You spit in my face, you beat
a federal agent almost half to death.

670
01:22:36,038 --> 01:22:39,040
Then you point your gun at a state
trooper and dare him to shoot you.

671
01:22:39,041 --> 01:22:42,544
I did what I had to, damn it... You did
more than that. You were enjoying yourself.

672
01:22:43,045 --> 01:22:46,047
I saw you! You've jeopardized
this entire operation.

673
01:22:46,048 --> 01:22:49,050
There isn't a cop within a thousand
miles who isn't gunnin' for you!

674
01:22:49,051 --> 01:22:54,056
Fuck 'em! And fuck you!

675
01:22:58,559 --> 01:23:03,563
Everything's turnin' to shit.
It's gotta stop.

676
01:23:03,564 --> 01:23:07,568
Look... I don't wanna go on with this.
Let's make some arrests.

677
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:11,571
It's obvious you're
under a terrible strain.

678
01:23:11,572 --> 01:23:15,575
But now is not the best time
to terminate the operation.

679
01:23:15,576 --> 01:23:19,579
I can't do this anymore!... Just give me
two weeks. We've worked so hard on this.

680
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:23,584
Everything we've done could go out the
window. I've been invited to Washington!

681
01:23:25,087 --> 01:23:28,089
You fuck.

682
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:30,092
Pardon?

683
01:23:31,592 --> 01:23:36,596
Price goes to Washington.
Price smashes drug ring.

684
01:23:36,597 --> 01:23:41,103
You don't give a shit about
anything or anybody but yourself.

685
01:23:41,602 --> 01:23:44,604
You're pathetic.

686
01:23:44,605 --> 01:23:49,111
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna drink with a friend.

687
01:23:53,614 --> 01:23:56,617
Shit.

688
01:23:58,619 --> 01:24:03,124
Nobody's got any identity anymore.

689
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:08,129
Ya ever notice that?

690
01:24:08,130 --> 01:24:11,632
A bunch of gray men
walkin' around.

691
01:24:12,134 --> 01:24:16,636
No faces, no balls,

692
01:24:16,637 --> 01:24:19,141
carryin' their fuckin' lunch pails.

693
01:24:25,147 --> 01:24:28,150
Only one solution, man.

694
01:24:31,153 --> 01:24:33,638
Put on my colors, Sid.

695
01:24:36,641 --> 01:24:41,145
When you got the gun,
you walk in a room,

696
01:24:41,146 --> 01:24:44,149
everybody shits in their pants.

697
01:24:46,151 --> 01:24:51,656
- Your guys won't mind.
- I can't do it, Blood.

698
01:25:00,165 --> 01:25:03,668
- Let me ask you a question.
- Shoot.

699
01:25:06,171 --> 01:25:09,174
That's a hell of an idea.

700
01:25:11,676 --> 01:25:12,677
You see?

701
01:25:13,178 --> 01:25:16,181
See what I mean?

702
01:25:16,681 --> 01:25:19,184
Gun is power.

703
01:25:19,684 --> 01:25:22,687
Power makes fear.

704
01:25:23,188 --> 01:25:27,692
And weakness only makes
your fuckin' bowels run.

705
01:25:30,195 --> 01:25:32,696
Point that somewhere else.

706
01:25:32,697 --> 01:25:35,200
You know,

707
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:39,704
I can't remember if I put any shells
in this fuckin' thing or not.

708
01:25:57,222 --> 01:25:59,724
Fuck.

709
01:26:08,733 --> 01:26:10,735
Where the hell
did you park the car, man?

710
01:26:11,236 --> 01:26:14,738
I really don't know because
I can't see right now.

711
01:26:14,739 --> 01:26:16,741
Why don't you open your eyes?

712
01:26:19,244 --> 01:26:24,249
Open your eyes, man.
You got 'em all squinted up.

713
01:26:24,749 --> 01:26:26,751
That's a hell of an idea.

714
01:26:27,252 --> 01:26:31,255
I think what we really need
right now is the call of the wild.

715
01:26:31,256 --> 01:26:34,258
- There ya go.
- Yeah.

716
01:26:34,259 --> 01:26:36,261
Wanna be...

717
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:48,272
- Is that better?
- What?

718
01:26:48,273 --> 01:26:51,775
- You can see now?
- Now wait a minute.

719
01:26:51,776 --> 01:26:53,778
Now wait a minute.

720
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:57,781
- You're the one that couldn't see, right?
- No, it was you.

721
01:26:57,782 --> 01:27:00,285
No, no, no, no, no.

722
01:27:02,787 --> 01:27:05,790
Remember me, asshole?

723
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:09,293
What the fuck is going on? You know
this guy? Is he a friend of yours?

724
01:27:09,294 --> 01:27:12,796
Our beef's not with you.
You can walk.

725
01:27:12,797 --> 01:27:15,800
All right.

726
01:27:17,802 --> 01:27:22,306
Take it easy, man... Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Blood!

727
01:27:22,307 --> 01:27:24,809
You owe me something.

728
01:27:28,813 --> 01:27:30,815
Why don't you shove it?

729
01:27:37,322 --> 01:27:39,824
Motherfucker!

730
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:47,332
Blood!

731
01:27:56,341 --> 01:28:00,845
'Fore I do ya, man,
I want you to see my face.

732
01:28:01,346 --> 01:28:03,348
Fuck you!

733
01:28:08,353 --> 01:28:12,357
Crazy, crazy son of a bitch!

734
01:28:13,858 --> 01:28:18,363
I found the car, man.

735
01:28:20,865 --> 01:28:24,869
What'd you think I was gonna do,
leave you here?... 'Fraid so.

736
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:28,872
You ain't afraid of nothin', man.
Neither am I.

737
01:28:28,873 --> 01:28:31,876
Now let's get the fuck
outta here. Come on.

738
01:28:45,990 --> 01:28:49,494
- Renee?
- I'm in here.

739
01:28:51,996 --> 01:28:55,999
Shut the door, shut the door!

740
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,004
Come here, I wanna show you something.
Come here, hurry.

741
01:29:01,506 --> 01:29:04,508
See this?

742
01:29:04,509 --> 01:29:07,010
Your shadow didn't come in right.

743
01:29:07,011 --> 01:29:12,516
My what?... The shadow. I had to add
some light and make you a new one.

744
01:29:12,517 --> 01:29:18,022
Watch this. Here it comes.

745
01:29:26,531 --> 01:29:30,035
- Fuck.
- Amazing, isn't it?

746
01:29:31,536 --> 01:29:34,539
I gotta get the fuck outta here.

747
01:29:37,042 --> 01:29:39,044
Dan?

748
01:29:42,047 --> 01:29:45,549
Jesus, what happened to you?

749
01:29:48,053 --> 01:29:53,058
I think...
I'm losing my fucking mind.

750
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:59,562
Everything keeps happening
just like in the story.

751
01:29:59,563 --> 01:30:03,068
There's no other way
to explain it.

752
01:30:04,568 --> 01:30:08,571
Dan, we gotta get outta here.

753
01:30:08,572 --> 01:30:12,575
Let's just get in the car and go.
I'll wake Marybette up. We'll just leave.

754
01:30:12,576 --> 01:30:16,080
- I'm finished here.
- I can't!

755
01:30:16,081 --> 01:30:18,582
Why not?

756
01:30:22,087 --> 01:30:25,090
Blood saved my life tonight.

757
01:30:28,093 --> 01:30:33,596
Don't you see? I can't leave now.
I have to do something... Like what?

758
01:30:33,597 --> 01:30:38,602
I don't know. Tip him off, keep him from
getting busted. He saved my life, Renee.

759
01:30:39,104 --> 01:30:44,108
He saved Sid's life, Dan, not yours.
Can you still tell the difference?

760
01:30:44,109 --> 01:30:46,610
Can you?

761
01:30:57,621 --> 01:30:59,622
This is insane.

762
01:30:59,623 --> 01:31:03,626
I make up my mind never to care
about anybody again and here I am,

763
01:31:03,627 --> 01:31:08,133
stuck with a man who thinks he's a character in
a story who's got an appointment with death.

764
01:31:09,633 --> 01:31:12,636
Am I supposed to be learning
something from this?

765
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:19,143
And what are you learning from it, Dan?
What are you learning from this?

766
01:31:19,144 --> 01:31:21,145
- Take it easy.
- No!

767
01:31:21,146 --> 01:31:25,648
When you were a little kid, your uncle did
horrible things to you. You were a victim.

768
01:31:25,649 --> 01:31:29,652
Now look what you've become. You can't tell
the knife from the fucking wound anymore!

769
01:31:29,653 --> 01:31:32,157
I gotta go.

770
01:31:33,158 --> 01:31:36,660
Yeah, so do I.

771
01:31:39,663 --> 01:31:41,665
Renee, I...

772
01:32:10,195 --> 01:32:14,198
I really need to talk to you privately.

773
01:32:14,199 --> 01:32:18,701
- Now's not a good time.
- Well, when?

774
01:32:18,702 --> 01:32:21,205
Later, man, we'll talk later.

775
01:32:21,206 --> 01:32:24,708
Blood, this is really important.

776
01:32:29,713 --> 01:32:33,716
- What, are you feedin' a fuckin' army, Oatmeal?
- Bite me, man!

777
01:32:33,717 --> 01:32:36,719
Even as a little kid, I wanted more.
Understand "more"?

778
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:38,721
Ya ever want more?

779
01:32:38,722 --> 01:32:40,724
More food, more toys.

780
01:32:41,226 --> 01:32:45,728
More chicks, more little girls,
more pussy.

781
01:32:45,729 --> 01:32:49,732
- You guys are gonna rob this place.
- No, we are, man.

782
01:32:49,733 --> 01:32:51,734
You're with us.

783
01:32:51,735 --> 01:32:54,239
- Hey, come on, Oatmeal.
- I said, bite me!

784
01:32:54,738 --> 01:32:57,740
Give me the goddamn money
right now!

785
01:32:57,741 --> 01:33:01,246
- Put the goddamn gun away.
- Blood, what the fuck is with this guy?

786
01:33:06,251 --> 01:33:11,255
- You big motherfu...
- Shut the fuck up! You just stepped on your meat.

787
01:33:11,256 --> 01:33:14,758
- We gotta get the fuck outta here!
- I would've given you everything.

788
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:18,262
My house, my club,
the fuckin' shirt off my back.

789
01:33:18,263 --> 01:33:22,267
Shoot the son of a bitch... I don't know
whether he's worth savin' or not.

790
01:33:22,766 --> 01:33:25,768
People can see us in here.
We gotta get the fuck out!

791
01:33:25,769 --> 01:33:31,275
Everything depends on what you do next. Either
you ride with me or you disappear forever.

792
01:33:31,276 --> 01:33:34,278
- You understand what I'm sayin'?
- Are you gonna smoke him or what?

793
01:33:34,279 --> 01:33:40,284
Why don't you shut the fuck up!... Yeah?
What about her? She can fuckin' identify us!

794
01:33:40,285 --> 01:33:43,288
No, don't!

795
01:33:48,293 --> 01:33:52,297
Now that's what we do
with damsels in distress.

796
01:34:18,323 --> 01:34:21,825
I'm so sorry.

797
01:35:02,367 --> 01:35:05,370
May I have your attention, please?

798
01:35:08,872 --> 01:35:13,378
May I have your attention, please?

799
01:35:13,877 --> 01:35:16,846
As you know, three different state
agencies are represented here today,

800
01:35:16,847 --> 01:35:20,351
along with the FBI,
Drug Enforcement Agency,

801
01:35:20,352 --> 01:35:24,855
alcohol, tobacco and firearms,
and the U.S. Treasury.

802
01:35:26,358 --> 01:35:28,858
Gentlemen,

803
01:35:28,859 --> 01:35:32,862
at precisely 11:00 p.m. tonight,
and continuing through dawn,

804
01:35:32,863 --> 01:35:37,884
an unprecedented number of arrests will
be made in California, Arizona and Nevada.

805
01:35:37,885 --> 01:35:42,890
These arrests will be staggered
by location and time...

806
01:35:43,391 --> 01:35:45,892
to minimize the possibility
of alerting any of the suspects.

807
01:35:45,893 --> 01:35:49,896
The significance of this many arrests
over such a vast area is awesome.

808
01:35:49,897 --> 01:35:53,400
It represents a substantial blow
to organized crime in Arizona,

809
01:35:53,401 --> 01:35:58,406
and it is the result
of one man's dedicated effort.

810
01:35:58,906 --> 01:36:03,910
An effort expended, I might add,
at considerable personal cost.

811
01:36:03,911 --> 01:36:07,414
Now, you've all heard by now that
we've had an undercover officer...

812
01:36:07,415 --> 01:36:10,417
deep within the outlaw
motorcycle community.

813
01:36:10,418 --> 01:36:14,421
But I think you'll be surprised
when you meet him.

814
01:36:14,422 --> 01:36:17,924
In fact, I know you will be.

815
01:36:17,925 --> 01:36:21,428
His name is...

816
01:36:21,429 --> 01:36:24,432
Daniel Saxon.

817
01:36:25,933 --> 01:36:27,935
Daniel.

818
01:37:18,986 --> 01:37:21,488
All I want is to arrest him myself.

819
01:37:21,489 --> 01:37:25,992
No. The man is completely unpredictable.
What if something happens to you?

820
01:37:25,993 --> 01:37:30,497
- Nothing's gonna happen.
- This is insane. I could lose my star witness.

821
01:37:30,498 --> 01:37:35,002
If I don't agree to this,
will you still testify?

822
01:37:40,007 --> 01:37:42,008
Look.

823
01:37:42,009 --> 01:37:47,013
You told me once
that I needed this job,

824
01:37:47,014 --> 01:37:50,517
that I had some unfinished
business to take care of.

825
01:37:50,518 --> 01:37:53,019
And you were right.

826
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:56,022
And this is one more thing...

827
01:37:56,023 --> 01:37:59,527
that I have to do by myself.

828
01:38:02,530 --> 01:38:04,531
You owe me, Price.

829
01:38:04,532 --> 01:38:07,535
You owe me, and you know it!

830
01:38:09,537 --> 01:38:12,040
Now what's it gonna be?

831
01:38:20,548 --> 01:38:22,549
I'll give you five minutes.

832
01:39:38,126 --> 01:39:41,129
- Who the fuck is it?
- Narcotics officer.

833
01:39:43,131 --> 01:39:48,635
Narcotics officer?
I love that joke.

834
01:39:50,138 --> 01:39:53,141
Come on in.

835
01:39:59,646 --> 01:40:04,151
Hiya, Sid. Guess you finally got your
priorities straightened out,

836
01:40:04,152 --> 01:40:06,153
Yeah.

837
01:40:06,154 --> 01:40:09,156
Makin' some eggs here.
Want some?

838
01:40:09,157 --> 01:40:12,658
Got somethin' for ya, Blood.

839
01:40:12,659 --> 01:40:15,662
Yeah?

840
01:40:27,674 --> 01:40:33,181
You're wrong, man. It's not about power.
It's about somethin' else.

841
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:36,683
She was a human being.

842
01:40:37,185 --> 01:40:42,190
Her name was Susan Han. She was
20 years old, and she wanted to live.

843
01:40:46,693 --> 01:40:50,697
Where the fuck
did you get those, man?

844
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:56,204
You were right about one thing.
We did meet before.

845
01:41:11,718 --> 01:41:14,222
You're the fucking cop from Linkville.

846
01:41:14,721 --> 01:41:18,226
Yeah. I'm still in your fuckin' way.

847
01:41:25,233 --> 01:41:27,235
What are you gonna do?

848
01:41:27,734 --> 01:41:33,240
You're under arrest, Blood, for murder...

849
01:41:33,241 --> 01:41:35,243
and trafficking narcotics.

850
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:44,251
Don't even think about it.

851
01:41:44,252 --> 01:41:46,753
I'm thinkin' about it.

852
01:41:51,758 --> 01:41:54,761
You fuckin' pig.

853
01:42:11,279 --> 01:42:14,781
Open the goddamn door!

854
01:42:15,283 --> 01:42:18,785
You don't come outta here now, I'm gonna
blow this door down! Now come outta here!

855
01:42:20,288 --> 01:42:22,788
- What the hell happened in there?
- Now it's finished.

856
01:42:22,789 --> 01:42:25,293
No, it's not! It's not over yet!

857
01:42:28,296 --> 01:42:31,798
You still have to testify, Daniel.

858
01:43:29,357 --> 01:43:31,358
The story you've just seen is true.

859
01:43:31,359 --> 01:43:33,876
Some of the names and locations
have been changed, but it's true.

860
01:43:33,877 --> 01:43:36,880
Over 200 people got busted
out there in the desert.

861
01:43:37,381 --> 01:43:39,882
Blood's doing three
consecutive life terms.

862
01:43:39,883 --> 01:43:42,885
The real Dan Saxon lives with Renee
somewhere In Northern California...

863
01:43:42,886 --> 01:43:45,388
and appeared as an extra
in this movie.

864
01:43:45,389 --> 01:43:48,892
Me? There still ain't nothin' about
a scooter that I can't fix.

865
01:43:49,393 --> 01:43:51,953
And I guess that you could say that
I'm pretty much... All right.

866
01:47:30,540 --> 01:47:32,540
