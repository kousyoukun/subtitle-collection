A moment later, Scrooge found himself
standing on a city street,

645
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:16,895
looking at a building
he had not seen in years.

646
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:20,607
Tell me, Ebenezer Scrooge,
do you know this place?

647
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,569
Know it? My first job was here.

648
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,613
This is Fozziwig's
old rubber chicken factory.

Once again, it was Christmas Eve,

00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:33,078
night was falling, and
the lamplighters were plying their trade.

651
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:37,291
Hey, light the lamp, not the rat.
Light the lamp, not the rat!

-Oops! My apologies.
-What are you doing?

Look my lads, dusk has fallen,
and the lamplighters are at work.

661
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:03,692
It's Christmas Eve for certain.

662
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:05,736
What an employer he was.

663
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,822

At this time in the proceedings,

it is a tradition for me
to make a little speech.

-It was obvious.
-It was pointless.

A cup of kindness
that we share with another

805
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:41,710
A sweet reunion
with a friend or a brother

806
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:44,629
In all the places you find love

807
00:48:44,714 --> 00:48:47,591
it feels like Christmas

808
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:52,178
It is the season of the heart

809
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:55,181
A special time of caring

810
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:58,685
The ways of love made clear

811
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:03,898
And it is the season of the spirit

812
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:06,443
The message if we hear it

813
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:10,363
is make it last all year

814
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:18,413
It's in the giving of a gift
to another

815
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:21,249
A pair of mittens
that were made by your mother

816
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:24,210
It's all the ways that we show love

817
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,713
that feel like Christmas

818
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:29,591
A part of childhood
we'll always remember

819
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,510
It is the summer
of the soul in December

820
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:35,722
Yes, when you do your best for love

821
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,933
it feels like Christmas

822
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:43,063
It is the season of the heart

823
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:46,024
A special time of caring

824
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:49,944
The ways of love made clear

825
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:54,407
It is the season of the spirit

826
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:57,243
The message, if we hear it

827
00:49:57,328 --> 00:50:01,206
is make it last all year

828
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:09,339
It's in the singing
of a street corner choir

829
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:12,092
It's going home
and getting warm by the fire

830
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:15,220
It's true wherever you find love

831
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:17,639
it feels like Christmas

832
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:24,312
It's true wherever you find love

833
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:31,277
it feels like Christmas

834
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:37,283
It feels like Christmas

835
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:42,080
It feels like Christmas!
(LAUGHING)

836
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:50,088
It feels like Christmas

837
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,093
Spirit, I had no idea.

838
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:59,222
I wish to see friends, kin.
Show me family.

839
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:05,395
It's Fred. My dear nephew Fred
and his wife, Clara.

840
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:07,564
Having Christmas with friends.

841
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:09,733
(GASPS) Hey, look. Fruit.

842
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:12,902
Well, now, we've had the plum pudding
and sung the carols.

843
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:15,071
-What now, my lovelies?
-A game, Fred.

844
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:17,323
Yeah, we must have a game
at Christmas.

845
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:21,035
-Do people play games at Christmas?
-I love games.

846
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,663
Say, do you know that fruit is wax?

847
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:27,083
Oh, yeah, I wondered about the texture.
(SPITS)

848
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:29,669
-Let's play "Yes and No."
-Wonderful game.

849
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:33,423
Ah! That's a great game. I'll be it.

850
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,050
Yes, let Fred be it.
He always thinks of good things.

851
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:38,720
I do have a good one, Clara. Guess.

852
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,014
Is it vegetable?

853
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,432
FRED: No.
CLARA: Mineral?

854
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:43,975
-No.
-Animal, then?

855
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,102
-What else?
-What else, indeed.

856
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:48,021
-Is it found on a farm?
-Never.

857
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,023
-In the city?
-Usually.

858
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,233
Does it pull a hansom cab?

859
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:53,610
(LAUGHS) Certainly not.

860
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,445
How about a dog?

861
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:56,946
-No.
-A cat?

862
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,157
-A cat?
-I said it first.

863
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,325
No.

864
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,995
Wait, is this an unwanted creature?

865
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:06,206
-Often.
-A mouse?

866
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,457
-No.
-A rat?

867
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,459
-You called?
-A cockroach.

868
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,627
No.

869
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:12,420
-A leech?
-It's too wonderful.

870
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:15,298
Wait, I know. An unwanted creature,

871
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,717
but not a rat, a leech, or a cockroach?

872
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,719
-Then what?
-What?

873
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:21,304
It's Ebenezer Scrooge.

874
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,597
-Yes.
-(ALL LAUGHING)

875
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:26,142
Wonderful.

That's a killer.

00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:38,738
Come, there is much to see.

00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:42,075
No more. I wish to see no more.

879

Here.

880
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,084
Why have we come
to this odd corner of the town?

881
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,837
It's Christmas here, too, you know.

882
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:56,256
That's Bob Cratchit's house.

883
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:59,467
Perhaps it was the spirit's
own generous nature,

884
00:52:59,552 --> 00:53:01,678
and his sympathy for all poor men,

885
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:05,807
that led them straight to the home
of Scrooge's faithful clerk.

886
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:10,520

-How do you know that?

00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:25,118
You just told me.

966
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:52,116
-Mr. Scrooge.
-Bob.

967
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:53,993
Bob Cratchit?

968
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,622
It only seems right that
I should lift a glass to my employer.

969
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:00,666
I give you Mr. Scrooge,
the founder of the feast.

970
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:03,127
The founder of the feast, indeed.

971
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:07,882
If I had him here, I would give him
a piece of my mind to feast upon.

972
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,884
And I bet he would choke on it.

973
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:12,553
-Choke!
-My dear, the children.

974
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:13,846
Christmas Day.

975
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:18,392
Well, I suppose that
on the blessed day of Christmas,

976
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:22,021
one must drink to the health
of Mr. Scrooge,

977
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:25,358
even though he is odious,
stingy, wicked,

978
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:28,861
-and unfeeling, and badly dressed.
-(GASPS)

979
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:32,573
To the founder of the feast,
Mr. Scrooge.

980
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:38,996
To Mr. Scrooge, he'll be very merry
and happy this day, I have no doubt.

981
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,164
BOTH: No doubt.

982
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:41,666
Hmm. Cheers.

983
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:45,545
God bless us, every one.

(SINGING)
Life is full of sweet surprises

985
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:54,387
Every day's a gift

986
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:57,390
The sun comes up and I can feel it

987
00:57:57,516 --> 00:58:00,226
lift my spirit

988
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:05,398
Fills me up with laughter
Fills me up with song

989
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:08,359
I look into the eyes of love

990
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:11,696
And know that I belong

991

The loving family I hold dear

994
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:25,793
No place on Earth

995
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:28,129
compares with home

996
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:33,926
And every path will bring me
back from where I roam

997
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:36,971
Bless us all

999
00:58:39,892 --> 00:58:45,313
We always comfort and forgive

1000
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:48,191
We have so much

1001
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:50,902
that we can share

1002
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:56,073
With those in need
we see around us everywhere

1003
00:58:56,158 --> 00:59:00,494
Let us always love each other

Lead us to the light

1005
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:12,798
Let us hear the voice of reason

1006
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:16,135
singing in the night

1007
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:22,058
Let us run from anger

1008
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:27,605
And catch us when we fall

1009

Teach us in our dreams
And please, yes, please

Bless us, one and all

we ask you, bless us all

1023

Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live.

1024
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,880
That is the future.

1025
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,966
My realm is the present.

1026
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:42,680
However, I see a vacant seat
by the chimney corner.

1027
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,724
And a crutch without an owner.

1028
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:50,479
If these shadows remain unaltered,
I believe the child will die.

1029
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:53,941
But then, if he's going to die,
he'd better do it,

1030
01:00:54,026 --> 01:00:56,485
and decrease the surplus population.

DICKENS: As the Cratchit family
vanished into the darkness,

1033
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:06,579
Scrooge kept his eyes upon Tiny Tim,
until the last.

1034

Come. My time grows short.

1035
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:19,091
Spirit, do you grow old?

1036
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,260
I do. (LAUGHS)

Are spirits' lives so short?

1038
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:28,934
My time upon this globe is very brief.

1039
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:33,981
I believe it will end
upon the stroke of 1 2.

Nothing Scrooge could do or say
could stop

1044
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:48,287
the relentless march

I think I must, in fact.

You have meant so much to me.
You have changed me.

He didn't give it to me.

It's likely to be a cheap funeral.

It's a spot on the hill.

watching the ducks on the river.

But, Mr. Scrooge, sir, we did discuss it.

1281
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:48,681
It's Christmas Day.
You gave me the day off.

1282
01:18:48,766 --> 01:18:51,893
I? I, Ebenezer Scrooge?

1283
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:54,521
-Would I do a thing like that?
-No.

1284
01:18:54,814 --> 01:18:56,231
I mean, yes, but you did.

1285
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:57,899
Bob Cratchit, I've had my fill of this.

1286
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,568
And I have had my fill of you,
Mr. Scrooge.

1287
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:02,654
And therefore, Bob Cratchit...

1288
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:05,073
And therefore,
you can leave this house at once.

1289
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:07,659
And therefore,
I'm about to raise your salary.

1290
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:11,746
And I am about to raise you
right off the pavement...

1291
01:19:11,831 --> 01:19:12,956
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

1292
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,667
Yes, Bob. Raise your salary.

1293
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:18,253
And pay your mortgage on this house.

1294
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,131
Oh. (NERVOUS CHUCKLE)

1295
01:19:21,215 --> 01:19:24,092
-Please, sir, come inside.
-Yes, yes.

1296
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:27,595
Bob Cratchit, would you and your family
care to join us

1297
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,932
for a little turkey dinner
on this fine Christmas Day?

1298
01:19:31,559 --> 01:19:33,560
Merry Christmas.

1299
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:35,603
(ALL GREETING)

1300
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:42,735
(LAUGHING)

1301
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:45,780
DICKENS: And Scrooge
was better than his word.

1302
01:19:45,865 --> 01:19:48,450
He did it all, and infinitely more.

1303
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:50,452
And Tiny Tim?

1304
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:54,080
And Tiny Tim, who did not die...

1305
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:55,707
Aw, isn't that swell?

1306
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:58,960
To Tiny Tim,
Scrooge became a second father.

1307
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:01,713
He became as good a friend,
as good a master,

1308
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:05,341
and as good a man
as the good old city ever had.

1309
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:08,761
It was always said of him that
he knew how to keep Christmas well,

1310
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:11,181
if any man alive
possessed the knowledge.

1311
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:15,310
May that truly be said of us
and all of us.

1312
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:17,937
And so, as Tiny Tim observed...

1313
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:21,149
-God bless us.
-God bless us.

1314
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:22,984
Every one.

1315
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:27,739
(SINGING) The love we found

1316
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:30,992
The love we found

1317
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:33,995
We carry with us

1318
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:38,166
so we're never quite alone

1319
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:45,757
The love we found

1320
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:49,302
The sweetest dream

1321
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:53,681
that we have ever known

1322
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:56,309
Hey, say goodbye!

1323
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:01,022
The love we found

1324
01:21:02,233 --> 01:21:04,234
Goodbye, goodbye.

1325
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:09,781
So we're never quite alone

1326
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,366
RIZZO: Nice story, Mr. Dickens.

1327
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:14,702
DICKENS: Oh, thanks. If you like this,
you should read the book.

1328
01:21:15,162 --> 01:21:17,872
It's in the singing
of a street corner choir

1329
01:21:17,957 --> 01:21:20,583
It's going home
and getting warm by the fire

1330
01:21:20,834 --> 01:21:23,920
It's true wherever you find love

1331
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:26,506
It feels like Christmas

1332
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:29,217
A cup of kindness
that we share with another

1333
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:32,136
A sweet reunion
with a friend or a brother

1334
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:35,056
In all the places you find love

1335
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:37,600
It feels like Christmas

1336
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:42,605
It is the season of the heart

1337
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:45,567
A special time of caring

1338
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:49,362
The ways of love made clear

1339
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:54,117
And it is the season
of the spirit

1340
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:56,786
The message if we hear it

1341
01:21:56,870 --> 01:22:00,915
Is make it last all year

1342
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:05,962
GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT:
Oh, yes! Make it last all year.

1343
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:08,673
It's in the giving of a gift
to another

1344
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:11,926
A pair of mittens
that were made by your mother

1345
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:14,846
It's all the ways that we show love

1346
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:17,098
That feel like Christmas

1347
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:20,101
A part of childhood
we'll always remember

1348
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:22,979
It is the summer of the soul
in December

1349
01:22:23,063 --> 01:22:25,940
Yes, when you do your best
for love

1350
01:22:26,025 --> 01:22:28,234
It feels like Christmas

1351
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:33,448
And remember,
it is the season of the heart

1352
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:36,409
A special time of caring

1353
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:40,622
The ways of love made clear

1354
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:44,959
It is the season of the spirit

1355
01:22:45,044 --> 01:22:47,712
The message, if we hear it

1356
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:51,674
Is make it last all year

1357
01:22:51,759 --> 01:22:54,218
(GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT
LAUGHING)

1358
01:22:56,847 --> 01:22:59,641
It's in the singing
of a street corner choir

1359
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:02,477
It's going home
and getting warm by the fire

1360
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:05,480
It's true wherever you find love

1361
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:08,274
It feels like Christmas

1362
01:23:08,359 --> 01:23:14,739
It's true wherever you find love

1363
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:40,473
It feels like Christmas
