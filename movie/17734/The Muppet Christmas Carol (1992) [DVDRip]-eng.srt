1
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,998
- Well. That was a fine meal.
- Yes. It was. Wasn't it?

2
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,598
Yes. Where shall we go now?

3
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,279
- Let's have. Uh. Lunch!
- Oh. Good idea.

4
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,238
- Now quiet down. You melons.
- Hey. I'm being stolen!

5
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,919
Hey. Help me! Help me!
Hey. Put me down!

6
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,272
What about my nose?
Ow!

7
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,431
Banana peels comin' down!

8
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,072
Come along. Ladies.
Here's a nice Christmas turkey.

9
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,754
Turkeys!
Get your Christmas turkey.

10
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,031
Hey. Wha...
Get back in that box there!

11
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,033
Get your boomerang fish.
Oh! Guaranteed fresh.

12
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,789
Throw the fish away.
and it comes back to me.

13
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,434
- Get 'em while they're fresh.
- Apples! Christmas apples!

14
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,630
- We got Mclntosh!
- Get your Christmas apples.

15
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,188
- Red Delicious.
- Tuppence apiece while they last.

16
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,471
We... They won't last long
the way you're eating them.

17
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,193
Hey. I'm creatin' scarcity.
Drives the prices up.

18
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,151
Rizzo...

19
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,909
Hello! Welcome to
The Muppet Christmas Carol.

20
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,231
- I am here to tell the story.
- And I am here for the food.

21
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,029
- My name is Charles Dickens.
- And my name is Rizzo the Rat.

22
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,799
Hey. Wait a second.
You're not Charles Dickens.

23
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,239
- I am too!
- No.

24
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,999
A blue. Furry Charles Dickens
who hangs out with a rat?

25
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,828
- Absolutely!
- Dickens was a 19th-century novelist.

26
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,031
- A genius!
- Oh. You're too kind.

27
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,752
Why should I believe you?

28
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,230
Well. Because I know the story
of"A Christmas Carol"
like the back of my hand.

29
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,072
- Prove it!
- All right.

30
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,188
Um. There's a little mole on my thumb
and. Uh. A scar on my wrist...

31
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,713
- From when I fell off my bicycle.
- No. No. No. No.

32
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,149
Don't tell us your hand.
Tell us the story.

33
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,350
Oh. Oh. Thank you. Yes.

34
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,312
The Marleys were dead to begin with.

35
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,591
- Wha- Wha... Pardon me?
- That's how the story begins. Rizzo.

36
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,031
The Marleys were dead to begin with.
as dead as a doornail.

37
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,311
It's a good beginning.
It's creepy and kind of spooky.

38
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,233
- Oh. Thank you. Rizzo.
- You're welcome. Mr Dickens.

39
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,510
In life. The Marleys
had been business partners...

40
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,270
with a shrewd moneylender
named Ebenezer Scrooge.

41
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,193
You will meet him
as he comes around that corner.

42
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,309
- Where?
- There.

43
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,311
- When?
- Now.

44
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,432
There he is.
Mr Ebenezer Scrooge.

45
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,672
Say. Is it gettin' colder out here?

46
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,548
When a cold wind blows
it chills you

47
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,591
Chills you to the bone

48
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,151
But there's nothing in nature that freezes
your heart like years of being alone

49
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,800
It paints you with indifference

50
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,990
Like a lady paints with rouge

51
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,389
- And the worst of the worst
- The most hated and cursed

52
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,789
Is the one that we call Scrooge

53
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,110
- Unkind as any
- And the wrath of many

54
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,191
This is Ebenezer Scrooge

55
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,078
Oh, there goes Mr Humbug

56
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,111
There goes Mr Grimm

57
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,668
If they gave a prize
for bein'mean

58
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,671
The winner would be him

59
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,550
Old Scrooge, he loves his money
'cause he thinks it gives him power

60
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,991
If he became a flavour
you can bet he would be sour

61
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,709
Even the vegetables
don't like him.

62
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,512
There goes Mr Skinflint
There goes Mr Greed

63
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,429
The undisputed master
of the underhanded deed

64
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,031
He charges folks a fortune
for his dark and draughty houses

65
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,509
Us poor folk live in misery

66
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,790
It's even worse for mouses

67
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,310
Please. Sir.
I want some cheese.

68
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,150
He must be so lonely
He must be so sad

69
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,830
He goes to extremes
to convince us he's bad

70
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,510
He's really a victim
of fear and of pride

71
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,789
Look close and there must be
a sweet man inside

72
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,273
- Nah.
- Uh-uh.

73
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,709
There goes Mr Outrage

74
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,069
There goes Mr Sneer

75
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,310
He has no time for friends or fun

76
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,039
His anger makes that clear

77
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,073
Don't ask him for a favour
'cause his nastiness increases

78
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,509
No crust of bread for those in need

79
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,393
No cheeses for us meeces

80
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,192
Scrooge liked the cold.

81
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,589
He was hard and sharp as a flint...

82
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,309
secretive. Self-contained.
as solitary as an oyster.

83
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,789
There goes Mr Heartless

84
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,990
There goes Mr Cruel

85
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,349
He never gives
He only takes

86
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,960
He lets his hunger rule

87
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,911
If being mean's a way of life

88
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,110
You practise and rehearse

89
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,399
Then all that work is paying off
'cause Scrooge is getting worse

90
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,594
Every day in every way
Scrooge is getting worse

91
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,108
- Oh. Boy!
- How the time flies! Look at this.

92
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,232
- I've got to go.
- What happened?

93
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,430
Hey. Guys. What happened?

94
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,670
Humbug.

95
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,153
What an unpleasant fella!

96
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,749
He was a tightfisted hand
at the grindstone. Scroo...

97
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,069
- Boy. This really is a dirty city.
- You're telling me!

98
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,792
- Come here.
- Hmm?

99
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,438
Thank you for making me
a part of this.

100
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,029
He was a tightfisted hand
at the grindstone. Scrooge...

101
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,271
a squeezing.
wrenching. Grasping...

102
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,312
clutching. Covetous old sinner.

103
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,033
- Bob Cratchit?
- Yes. Mr Scrooge?

104
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,390
- Who is this?
- It's Mr Applegate. Sir.

105
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,000
He's here to speak to you
about his mortgage.

106
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,270
Please. Mr Scrooge.
I know you're very angry about this.

107
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,788
And I didn't mean to fall behind
in the payments.

108
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,440
Lord knows.
it being Christmas and all.

109
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,232
Please don't shout at me. Sir.

110
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,232
That and. Of course. Little Gwen.
Her lungs aren't right.

111
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,390
The doctor takes his share. Don't he?

112
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,268
I mean. You can yell and scream and
you're right. But it won't do no good...

113
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,993
because I'm the stone
you can't squeeze blood from.

114
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,349
And that's the truth!

115
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,351
Thank you for not shouting at me.

116
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,233
- Seventy-two...
- Seventy-four...

117
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,590
Let us deal with the eviction notices
for tomorrow. Mr Cratchit.

118
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,474
- Tomorrow is Christmas. Sir.
- Very well.

119
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,239
You may gift-wrap them.

120
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,512
- Let us help you with that. Mr Cratchit.
- Oh. My. There are certainly a lot today.

121
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,751
- We'll get 'em.
- Okay. Okay.
- There you go. Boss.

122
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,592
- Here you go.
- Look out on that end.
Look out. Iook out!

123
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,989
Come on. Guys. Whoa!

124
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,833
Whoa! Look out!
Look out! Look out!

125
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,872
Christmas is a very busy time
for us. Mr Cratchit.

126
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,230
People preparing feasts.
giving parties...

127
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,392
spending the mortgage money
on frivolities.

128
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,989
One might say that December
is the foreclosure season.

129
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,231
Harvest time for the moneylenders.

130
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,550
- Hey. Boss. Ask him.
- Tell him. Mr Cratchit.

131
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,309
- Come on. Do it now. Boss.
- Uh. If you please. Mr Scrooge...

132
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,153
it's gotten colder.
and the bookkeeping staff...

133
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,760
would like to have an extra
shovelful of coal for the fire.

134
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,598
- We can't do the bookkeeping.
- Yeah. All of our pens
have turned to ink-cicles.

135
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,392
Our assets are frozen!

136
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,433
How would the bookkeepers like
to be suddenly unemployed?

137
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,913
Heatwave!

138
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,270
This is my island in the sun

139
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,670
l-I believe you've convinced them
once again. Mr Scrooge.

140
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,028
At that moment.
who should arrive at the door...

141
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,232
but Scrooge's nephew. Fred.
his only living relative.

142
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,273
- Nephew Fred? I don't see him.
- Trust me.

143
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,072
Hello? Uncle?

144
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,632
- Rizzo?
- You're very good at that. Mr Dickens.

145
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,910
A merry Christmas. Uncle Scrooge.

146
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,630
- God save ya!
- Merry Christmas? Bah humbug.

147
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,631
Quick! It'll be warmer in there.

148
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,310
Christmas a humbug. Uncle?
Oh. You don't mean that. Surely.

149
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,709
Actually. I think
it's colder in here.

150
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,548
Merry Christmas you say?
What right have you to be merry?
You're poor enough.

151
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,591
What right have you to be dismal?
You're rich enough.

152
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,750
He's got him there.
The old boy's speechless.

153
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,229
If I could work my will...

154
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,431
every idiot who goes about
with "Merry Christmas" on his lips...

155
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,988
would be cooked with his own turkey
and buried...

156
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,629
- With a stake of holly through his heart.
- Well. Not quite speechless.

157
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,159
- Oh. Uncle!
- Nephew...

158
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,113
you keep Christmas in your own way
and let me keep it in mine.

159
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,119
Christmas is a loving.
honest and charitable time.

160
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,072
And though it's never put a scrap
of gold or silver in my pocket...

161
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,879
I believe that Christmas has
done me good and will do me good...

162
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,070
and I say. God bless it!

163
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,348
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah!

164
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,871
And how does one celebrate Christmas
on the unemployment line?

165
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,034
Now. In these times. It was customary
on Christmas Eve...

166
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,719
for well-meaning gentlemen
to call upon businesses...

167
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,389
collecting donations
for the poor and homeless.

168
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,391
Mr Scrooge. I presume?

169
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,192
Who are you?

170
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,118
We're from the Order of Victoria
Charity Foundation.

171
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,550
We'd like to speak to you
about a donation.

172
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,388
Ah. Welcome! This jolly old
gentleman here is Mr Scrooge.

173
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,671
- He's very generous to charities.
- My dear nephew!

174
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,230
At this festive season
of the year. Mr Scrooge...

175
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,711
many of us feel that we must take care
of our poor and homeless.

176
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,950
And are there no prisons?
No poorhouses?

177
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,190
Oh. Plenty of those. Sir.

178
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,670
Oh! Excellent!
For a moment. I was worried.

179
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,111
Some of us are endeavouring to raise
a fund for the poor and the homeless.

180
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,151
What might I put you down for?

181
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,800
- Nothing.
- You wish to remain anonymous?

182
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,229
I wish to be left alone.

183
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,271
I do not make merry
myself at Christmas.

184
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,312
- That certainly is true.
- And I cannot afford
to make idle people merry.

185
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,992
That is certainly not true.

186
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,190
Don't you have other things to do
this afternoon. My dear nephew?

187
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,193
Sadly. I do. Uncle.
So I shall make my donation...

188
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,629
and leave you to make yours.

189
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,631
Thank you so very much.

190
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,838
Oh. Uncle. Come and have Christmas
dinner with me and Clara tomorrow.

191
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,190
- Why ever did you get married?
- Why? Because I fell in love.

192
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,553
That's the only thing in the world
sillier than a merry Christmas.

193
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,398
It's no use. Uncle. I shall keep
my Christmas humour to the last.

194
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,512
A merry Christmas to you
and a happy New Year.

195
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,909
- Merry Christmas. Fred.
- Merry Christmas. Bob.

196
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,353
Humbug!

197
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,879
Now. Then. Sir.
about the donation?

198
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,353
Well. Now. Let's see.

199
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,192
I know how to treat the poor.

200
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,232
My taxes go to pay
for the prisons and the poorhouses.

201
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,710
- The homeless must go there.
- But some would rather die.

202
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,830
If they'd rather die.
then they'd better do it...

203
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,559
and decrease the surplus population!

204
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,158
Oh. Dear. Oh. Dear.

205
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,668
- Oh. Dear. Oh. Dear.
- This is the door. You may use it.

206
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,832
All right. Beaker. Come along.

207
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,471
I think we've taken enough
of Mr Scrooge's time.

208
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,511
Oh. Dear. Dear. Dear.

209
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,069
Good King Wenceslas looked out
on the Feast of Stephen

210
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,232
Though the snow lay round about
deep and crisp and even

211
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,999
Brightly shown
the moon that night

212
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,952
Though the

213
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,789
- What do you want?
- Uh. P-penny for the song. Guv'nor?

214
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,750
Seventeen. Twenty-four. Fifty-eight...

215
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,828
two fifty-two. Twenty-one.
seventy-eight.

216
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,959
Uh. Excuse me. Mr Scrooge.
but it appears to be closing time.

217
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,989
Very well. I'll see you
at 8.00 tomorrow morning.

218
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,792
- Tomorrow's Christmas.
- 8.30 then.

219
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,879
If you please. Sir. Half an hour off hardly
seems customary for Christmas Day.

220
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,912
- Hardly customary.
- Not at all!

221
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,912
How much time off is customary.
Mr Cratchit?

222
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,191
Uh. Why. Um.
the. Uh. Whole day.

223
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,232
- Yes! Yeah. That's right! The whole day!
- The entire day?

224
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,748
No. That's the frog's idea.

225
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,439
If you please. Mr Scrooge.
why open the office tomorrow?

226
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,268
Other businesses will be closed.
You'll have no one to do business with.

227
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,113
It'll waste a lot
of expensive coal for the fire.

228
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,311
- Yes. That's definitely a point.
- That's a point.
- That's right.

229
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,830
It's a poor excuse for picking
a man's pocket every December the 25th.

230
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,552
But as I seem to be the only person
around who knows that...

231
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,469
- Take the day off.
- Yay!

232
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,239
What a boss! Oh. Man!

233
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,078
- We love you. Ebenezer!
- Will you stop that!

234
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,351
Thank you. Mr Scrooge.

235
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,669
- Be here all the earlier the next morning.
- Okay. Sir! You bet!

236
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,630
With their employer gone at last...

237
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,319
Bob Cratchit and the bookkeepers
immediately began...

238
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,911
that most pleasant of activities.
the celebration of Christmas.

239
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,791
He's gone!

240
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,189
Gentlemen.
let's close up for Christmas.

241
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,274
There's magic in the air this evening
Magic in the air

242
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,390
The world is at her best
you know

243
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,908
When people love and care

244
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,349
The promise of excitement

245
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,470
Is one the night will keep

246
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,071
After all, there's only
one more sleep till Christmas

247
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,390
- Okay. Fellas. Are you ready?
- Ready. Go.

248
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,552
- Alley-oop!
- Yay!

249
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,988
The world has got a smile today

250
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,389
The world has got a glow

251
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,230
- There's no such thing as strangers
when a stranger says hello
- Alley-oop! Yay!

252
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,791
And everyone is family
We're having so much fun

253
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,431
After all, there's only
one more sleep till Christmas

254
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,673
Okay. Ready.
Here we go.

255
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,751
Alley-oop!

256
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,113
- Yay!
- Ta-da!

257
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,720
- Easy. Easy.
- Back. Back. Back. Back.

258
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,991
Back it up.
All right!

259
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,473
That's it!

260
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,712
- We're all done.
- Very good. Gentlemen.

261
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,230
'Tis the season
to bejolly and joyous

262
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,791
With a burst of pleasure
we feel it arrive

263
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,633
It's a season when the saints
can employ us

264
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,708
To spread the news about peace
and to keep love alive

265
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,432
What's that?
Oh. Iook!

266
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,471
It's the penguins'
Christmas skating party.

267
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,632
Oh. My.

268
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,392
- Ah! Hmm. Uh. Yeah.
- Hey. What...

269
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,670
Hey. It's Bob Cratchit!

270
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,108
Oh. You big klutz.
you big klutz!

271
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,833
Oh. Thank you.
Thank you very much. What...

272
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,191
Wow!

273
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,231
- No way!
- Come on. Rizzo.

274
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,629
No way! No!

275
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,951
Oh. Boy.

276
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,628
Fun. Huh?

277
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,999
Merry Christmas. Penguins.

278
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,629
There's something in the wind today

279
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,870
- That's good for everyone
- Yeah.

280
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,349
Yes, faith is in our hearts today

281
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,079
We're shining like the sun

282
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,429
And everyone can feel it

283
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,511
- The feeling's running deep
- Merry Christmas. Mr Cratchit.

284
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,469
- After all, there's only
one more sleep till Christmas
- Merry Christmas!

285
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,399
After all
there's only one more sleep

286
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,558
Till Christmas Day

287
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,160
- Merry Christmas!
- Hmm.

288
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,672
Wow.

289
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,600
Scrooge lived in chambers
which had once belonged...

290
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,552
to his old business partners.
Jacob and Robert Marley.

291
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,551
- Have some bread?
- Not while I'm working.

292
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,790
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Okay. Suit yourself.

293
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,469
The building was a dismal
heap of brick on a dark street.

294
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,751
Now. Once again. I must ask you to
remember that the Marleys were dead...

295
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,559
- And decaying in their graves.
- Yuck!

296
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,431
That one thing
you must remember...

297
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,988
or nothing that follows
will seem wondrous.

298
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,032
- Um. Why are you whispering?
- It's for dramatic emphasis.

299
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,071
Oh.

300
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,269
Jacob Marley?

301
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,478
Scrooge!

302
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,519
Hey. You okay?

303
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,193
Humbug.

304
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,110
Oh. Gonzo. Speak to me.

305
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,113
I mean. Mr Dickens.
Charley. Are you hurt?

306
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,152
To say that Scrooge
was not startled would be untrue.

307
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,710
Still. The moment had passed.
and the world was as it should be.

308
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,950
He ain't hurt.
Didn't even break his concentration.

309
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,592
- Hmm?
- Nothin'.
- Oh.

310
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,192
Come on. Rizzo.
We'll follow him in.

311
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,391
In a minute. I had a little bag
of jelly beans over here.

312
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,471
Will you just get over here!

313
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,511
- All right.
- Sheesh.

314
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,598
- Steady. Steady.
- Scrooge made his way up the staircase...

315
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,710
caring not a button for the darkness.

316
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,394
Darkness was cheap.
and Scrooge liked it.

317
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,189
But the incident at the door
had made Scrooge wary.

318
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,392
Before he shut himself in for the night.
he searched his rooms.

319
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,710
- Okay. That does it!
- Pardon?

320
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,990
How do you know
what Scrooge is doin'?

321
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,952
- We're down here. And he's up there.
- I keep telling you.

322
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,713
Storytellers are omniscient.
I know everything.

323
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,991
Hoity-toity.
Mr Godlike Smarty-pants.

324
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,953
To conduct a proper search.
Scrooge was forced to light the lamps.

325
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,073
How does he do that?

326
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,511
It's my best dressing gown.

327
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,270
No harm done.

328
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,914
Look! It's Ebenezer Scrooge.

329
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,554
Looking older and
more wicked than ever.

330
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,670
I knew he wouldn't disappoint us.

331
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,359
Who are you?

332
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,039
In life.
we were your partners. Jacob...

333
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,640
And Robert Marley!

334
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,070
It looks like you.
but I don't believe it!

335
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,628
Why do you doubt your senses?

336
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,632
Because a little thing
can affect them.

337
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,871
A slight disorder of the stomach
can make them cheat.

338
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,831
You may be a bit
of undigested beef...

339
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,629
a blob of mustard.
a crumb of cheese.

340
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,070
Yes. There's more of gravy
than of grave about you!

341
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,952
- "More of gravy than of grave"?
- What a terrible pun.

342
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,749
- Where do you get those jokes?
- Leave comedy to the bears. Ebenezer.

343
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,508
Please. Jacob. Robert.
don't criticize me.

344
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,272
You always criticize me!

345
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,909
- We were always heckling you.
- It's good to be heckling again.

346
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,070
It's good to be doing anything again.

347
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,833
Why do you come to me?

348
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,348
We're Marley and Marley

349
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,709
Avarice and greed

350
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,231
We took advantage of the poor
Just ignored the needy

351
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,589
We specialized in causing pain

352
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,591
Spreading fear and doubt

353
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,830
And if you could not pay the rent

354
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,229
We simply threw you out

355
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,952
There was the year we evicted
the entire orphanage!

356
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,879
I remember the little tykes
all standing in the snowbank.

357
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,753
With their little
frostbitten teddy bears.

358
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,390
We're Marley and Marley

359
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,789
Our hearts were painted black

360
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,149
We should've known our evil deeds

361
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,668
Would put us both in shackles

362
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,671
Captive bound
we're double-ironed

363
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,069
Exhausted by the weight

364
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,750
- As freedom comes from giving love
- So prison comes with hate

365
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,510
We're Marley and Marley

366
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,471
We're Marley and Marley

367
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,471
But. My friends. You were not
unfeeling toward your fellow men.

368
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,632
True. There was something
about mankind we loved.

369
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,069
I think it was their money.

370
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,752
Doomed, Scrooge
You're doomed for all time

371
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,351
Your future is a horror story
written by your crime

372
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,030
Your chains are forged
by what you say and do

373
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,312
So have your fun when life is done
A nightmare waits for you

374
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,591
What are these terrible chains?

375
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,200
Oh. The chains!

376
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,119
We forged these chains in life
by our acts of greed.

377
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,230
You wear such a chain yourself.

378
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,993
Humbug.
Speak comfort to me. Friends.

379
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,598
Comfort?

380
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,080
You will be haunted
by three spirits.

381
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,190
Haunted?
I've already had enough of that.

382
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,353
Without these visits. You cannot hope
to avoid the path we tread.

383
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,949
Expect the first ghost tonight
when the bell tolls 1.00.

384
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,110
Can't I meet them all at once
and get it over with?

385
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,152
When the bell tolls 1.00!

386
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,470
We're Marley and Marley

387
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,439
We're Marley and Marley

388
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,113
We're Marley and Marley

389
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,631
Change!

390
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,153
And with that. The spirits of Scrooge's
partners vanished into the darkness...

391
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,350
leaving him once again...

392
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,752
- Alone in his room.
- Whoa. That's scary stuff.

393
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,910
Hey. Should we be worried
about the kids in the audience?

394
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,428
- Nah. That's all right. This is culture.
- Oh.

395
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,432
Oh. Uh. Jelly bean?
I had 'em in my pocket all along.

396
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,278
What?

397
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,670
Humbug.

398
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,150
- Come on!
- But I really hate this.

399
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,872
You wanted to know
what was happening.

400
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,993
Now. Scrooge's bedchamber is
on this side of the house. Now. Jump.

401
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,272
There's only two things in this life
I hate... heights and jumping from them.

402
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,430
Too late now.
Come on. I'll catch ya.

403
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,073
God save my little broken body.

404
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,433
Missed.

405
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,950
Oh. Wait a second!
I forgot my jelly beans. Um...

406
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,751
Oh. Good.

407
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,032
- What?
- You can fit through those bars?

408
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,308
Yeah.

409
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,868
- You are such an idiot.
- What? What?

410
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,952
Hey. What?
What? What?

411
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,678
Oh. Dear.

412
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,271
Scrooge slipped into the empty silence
of a dreamless sleep.

413
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,312
You know. A guy could break his tail
falling out of this tree.

414
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,271
You want to see
what's going on. Don't you?

415
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,510
- Yes.
- Look. There's Scrooge's window.

416
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,192
Oh. Yeah.

417
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:10,793
Expect the first ghost
when the bell tolls 1.00!

418
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,678
Wow!

419
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,559
Are you the spirit whose coming
was foretold to me?

420
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,749
I am.

421
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,398
But...

422
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,232
- You're just a child.
- I can remember nearly 1.900 years.

423
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,471
I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.

424
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,791
- What business has brought you here?
- Your welfare.

425
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,390
A night's unbroken rest
might aid my welfare.

426
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,789
Your salvation then.

427
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,150
Take heed.
Come.

428
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,669
I beg you. Spirit.
l... I am mortal and liable to fall.

429
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,109
A touch of my hand
and you shall fly.

430
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,478
- What are we doin'?
- Nothin'.

431
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,080
- What?
- Well. Just hold on.
- What?

432
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,989
- W-Watch out. Rizzo.
- What? Ow! Oh!

433
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,352
Whee!
Hello. London!

434
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,352
- Goodbye. Lunch!
- Yeah!

435
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,111
- Spirit?
- Yes?

436
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,713
Nothing.

437
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,790
- Oh. Iook. Rizzo.
- I don't wanna look.

438
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,400
Spirit. What is that light?

439
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,631
It cannot be dawn.

440
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,830
It is the past.

441
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,399
Look! It's beautiful. Rizzo.

442
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,510
Mommy!

443
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,793
Hey. We're going down.

444
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,751
Hang on. Rizzo!

445
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,600
- Sorry. Madam.
- Ouch!

446
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,552
Pardon me. Sir.
Look out. Rizzo!

447
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,030
- Rizzo. This is Louise.
- Yeah. We've met.

448
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,752
And so they arrived
in Ebenezer Scrooge's childhood.

449
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,509
- That was the worst trip of my life!
- Well. It's over now.

450
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,471
Yeah. Safe at last.

451
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,919
No.

452
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,349
No! No!
Oh. No. Stop.

453
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,029
Nice kitty. Nice kitty.
Ow! Ouch! I'm from New Jersey!

454
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,949
It was the afternoon
of Christmas Eve...

455
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,072
and Scrooge was conscious
of a thousand odours...

456
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,469
each one connected
with a thousand thoughts...

457
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,120
and hopes and joys and cares...

458
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,232
long. Long forgotten.

459
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,632
It's my old school.
I was a boy here.

460
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,029
That... That's Henry!

461
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,429
And Edmund. My best friend.

462
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,948
Hello. Boys.
Hello?

463
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,679
These are but shadows
of your past. Ebenezer.

464
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,359
They can neither see nor hear you.

465
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,630
Come and let us go inside.

466
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,149
- Rizzo. Stop playing with the cat.
- Help me! Save me!

467
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,668
- Help me! Save me! Help me! Save me!
- Follow me.

468
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,631
Help me! Save me!

469
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,799
Ow.

470
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,591
And what a flood of memories
came back to him...

471
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,632
as Scrooge beheld his old classroom.

472
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,752
I know it all so well. Spirit.

473
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,519
The desks.

474
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,551
The smell of the chalk.

475
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,791
I chose my profession in this room.

476
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,751
And is he. Too. Familiar?

477
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,670
Scrooge beheld a small boy...

478
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,679
a boy he knew.
oh. Very well indeed.

479
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:40,191
Good heavens.
It's me.

480
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,708
Hurry. Ebenezer.
The last coach is leaving.

481
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,830
Come on.
He never goes home for Christmas.

482
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,110
Who cares about stupid old Christmas?

483
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,232
I was often alone.

484
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,710
More time for reading and study.

485
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,989
The Christmas holiday was a chance
to get some extra work done.

486
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,389
A time for solitude.

487
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,872
- Rats don't understand these things.
- You were never a lonely child?

488
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,509
I had 1.2 74 brothers and sisters.

489
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,950
Sheesh.
Rats don't understand these things.

490
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,589
Let us see another Christmas
in this place.

491
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,551
They were all very much the same.

492
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,839
- Nothing ever changed.
- You changed.

493
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,150
The years performed
their terrible dance...

494
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,318
and in a moment. Scrooge had seen
his entire childhood pass.

495
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,750
He saw his old schoolroom
age and decay.

496
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,149
What? What the...
Hey. Hey! Ow!

497
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,878
So. Master Scrooge.
graduation day. And yet...

498
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,270
That's my old headmaster.
This man taught me my greatest lesson.

499
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,630
Stand up. Build your life
as this school is built.

500
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,472
Push!

501
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,112
My ear! My ear! My ear!

502
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,270
Ah. Yes! Work hard. Work long
and be constructive.

503
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,471
Oh. Ebenezer.
life is a golden opportunity.

504
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,710
Today you go forth
into the real world.

505
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,108
You must keep your nose
to the grindstone.

506
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,192
Work hard. Lad. And one day
your life will be as solid...

507
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,872
as this very building!

508
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,920
- I've been meaning to fix that shelf.
- Yes. Headmaster.

509
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,988
Well. Young man. You have been
apprenticed to a fine company in London.

510
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,669
Today you become a man of business.

511
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,032
- I'm looking forward to it. Headmaster.
- You will love business.

512
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,270
It is the American way.

513
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,510
- Sam?
- Hmm?

514
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,273
Oh. It is the British way!

515
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,312
- Good.
- Yes. Headmaster.

516
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,390
Oh. Here is your coachman. Ebenezer.

517
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,712
Come. Scrooge.
There is much to see.

518
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,950
Remember. Don't tip the driver.

519
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,199
A moment later. Scrooge found himself
standing on a city street...

520
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,233
Iooking at a building
he had not seen in years.

521
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,431
Tell me. Ebenezer Scrooge.
do you know this place?

522
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,790
Know it?
My first job was here.

523
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,678
This is Fozziwig's
old rubber chicken factory.

524
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,312
Once again.
it was Christmas Eve.

525
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:56,150
Night was falling. And the lamplighters
were plying their trade.

526
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,589
H-Hey! Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey!
Light the lamp. Not the rat!

527
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,910
- Light the lamp. Not the rat!
What are you doing?
- Oops! My apologies.

528
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,520
Put me out! Put me out! Put me out!
Put me out! Put me out! Put me out!

529
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,790
- Rizzo!
- What?

530
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,832
- Th-Th-Thank you.
- You're welcome.

531
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,759
There he is.
old Fozziwig himself.

532
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,030
Look. My lads.
dusk has fallen.

533
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,510
The lamplighters are at work.
It's Christmas Eve for certain.

534
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,591
What an employer he was.

535
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,752
As hard and as ruthless
as a rose petal.

536
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,990
It's time for the party to begin!

537
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,753
It's the Fozziwig Christmas party.

538
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,360
Rizzo. Come on!

539
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,391
Rizzo. Just grab hold of the stick.

540
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,550
Merry Christmas!

541
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,189
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you. Thank you.

542
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,312
Excuse me. Everyone.
C-Can we have some quiet. Please?

543
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,232
Whoa!

544
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,428
I suppose I should
be grateful for that.

545
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,710
You're welcome.

546
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,349
Please. Can I have your attention
for a moment?

547
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,631
Look. It's the Marley brothers...

548
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,591
my old partners as they were as lads.

549
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,148
Can I have your attention. Please?

550
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,232
Quiet!

551
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,239
- Thank you.
- That's better.

552
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,511
Welcome to Fozziwig and Mom's
annual Christmas party.

553
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:32,071
At this time in the proceedings.
it is a tradition for me
to make a little speech.

554
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,709
And it's a tradition for us
to take a little nap.

555
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,631
Pay no attention to them.
My speech.

556
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,274
Here is my Christmas speech.

557
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,993
"Thank you all.
and Merry Christmas."

558
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,671
- That was the speech?
- It was dumb!

559
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,312
- It was obvious!
- It was pointless!

560
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,749
It was short.

561
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,030
- I loved it!
- I loved it!

562
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,749
I'm bored with speeches.
Let's dance. Son.

563
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,673
Hey. Here's Mrs Fozziwig
to start the party.

564
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,188
- Way to go. Ma!
- Hit it. Boys!

565
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,589
Hello!

566
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,518
Hey. Iook. There's a buffet over here.
I'm kinda hungry.

567
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,950
In this ferdy hurdy bursky

568
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,310
Fa la la la la
la la la la

569
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,350
Ah. Forget it.
Mother always taught me...

570
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,072
never eat singing food.

571
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,990
It's a pleasure having you
here at the party.

572
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,793
- Please. Enjoy yourself.
- Excuse me. Mr Fozziwig?

573
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,912
- Excuse me.
- Yes. I've been going over the accounts.

574
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,798
Do you know how much the firm
is spending for this party?

575
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:44,153
Master Scrooge. This is Christmas!
It's a time for generosity!

576
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,668
Stop working. Enjoy yourself.
Go meet some people.

577
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,951
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Go ahead. Go ahead. Oh. Hello.

578
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,071
You dancing fool!

579
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,959
Belle. You know. I love these
annual Christmas parties.

580
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,639
I love 'em so much.
I think we'll do it twice a year!

581
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,830
- Excuse me.
- Oh. Master Scrooge!

582
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,632
Excuse me.

583
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,478
Belle. I'd like to introduce you
to Ebenezer Scrooge...

584
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,909
the finest young
financial mind in the city.

585
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,471
Ebenezer. This is Belle.
a friend of the Fozziwig family.

586
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,671
I'm pleased to meet you.

587
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,911
Well. I'm glad you two finally met.

588
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,911
Do you remember this meeting?

589
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,200
Remember?

590
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,832
Yes.

591
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,911
I remember.

592
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,032
There was. Of course.
another Christmas Eve...

593
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,509
with this young woman
some years later.

594
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,869
Oh. Please...

595
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,990
do not show me that Christmas.

596
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,233
Another year
before our wedding. Ebenezer.

597
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,113
Well. It can't be helped. Belle.

598
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,233
How could we marry now? There's not
even enough for a decent home.

599
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,191
The investments
haven't grown as they should.

600
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,191
So you said last year.

601
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,272
Business continues to be poor.

602
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,432
You're a partner in your own firm now.

603
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,471
And barely clearing expenses.

604
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,189
- You said the partnership was the goal.
- This is for you.

605
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,599
I love you. Belle.

606
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,590
You did once.

607
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,872
Oh. Rizzo.

608
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,313
Spirit. Show me no more.

609
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,510
Why do you delight
in torturing me?

610
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,991
I told you. These were the shadows
of the things that have been.

611
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,709
That they are what they are.
do not blame me.

612
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,829
Leave me!

613
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,319
Scrooge was left alone and exhausted
in his bedchamber.

614
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,990
And thus he remained until the nearby
clock began to strike the hour.

615
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,190
- What was that?
- 2.00.

616
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,430
- Oh. Is it too early for breakfast?
- Yes.

617
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,670
Oh. Good.
Supper time.

618
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,439
Scrooge knew that the second
of the ghosts was due to appear.

619
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,790
Yet now. As the clock
finished striking...

620
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,913
Nothing.

621
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,038
Come in and know me better. Man.

622
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,958
Come in and know me better. Man.

623
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,389
- Did I already say that?
- You did. Yeah.

624
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,392
I am the Ghost
of Christmas Present.

625
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,479
This is the night before the dawn
before the day of Christmas!

626
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,308
Did I tell you that I am
the Ghost of Christmas Present?

627
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,911
- You did. Yeah.
- Come in and know me better. Man!

628
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,070
You're a little absentminded. Spirit.

629
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,392
No! I'm a large
absentminded spirit!

630
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,469
My mind is filled
with the here and now.

631
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,199
And the now is Christmas!

632
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,870
I don't believe I've ever met
anybody like you before. Sir.

633
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,112
Really? Over 1.800 of my brothers
have come before me.

634
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,191
1.800?

635
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,470
Imagine the grocery bills.

636
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,753
Have you ever noticed that everything
seems wonderful at Christmas?

637
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,108
In all honesty. Spirit. No.

638
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,270
Perhaps I've never understood
about Christmas.

639
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,479
Before this day is done.
you will understand!

640
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,520
Oh. No. Oh. No!

641
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,352
Ah. We shall go out into the world.

642
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,509
I suppose you enjoyed that.

643
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,391
Of course.

644
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:11,191
May I welcome you
to Christmas morning.

645
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,033
It's in the singing
of a street corner choir

646
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,753
It's going home
and getting warm by the fire

647
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,712
It's true
wherever you find love

648
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,990
It feels like Christmas

649
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,753
A cup of kindness
that we share with another

650
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,633
A sweet reunion
with a friend or a brother

651
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,592
In all the places you find love

652
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,234
It feels like Christmas

653
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,839
It is the season of the heart

654
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,678
A special time of caring

655
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,599
The ways of love made clear

656
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,872
And it is
the season of the spirit

657
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,428
The message, if we hear it

658
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,790
Is make it last all year

659
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,793
It's in the giving
of a gift to another

660
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,559
A pair of mittens
that were made by your mother

661
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,592
It's all the ways
that we show love

662
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,949
That feel like Christmas

663
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,679
A part of childhood
we'll always remember

664
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,439
It is the summer
of the soul in December

665
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,392
Yes, when you do
your best for love

666
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,512
It feels like Christmas

667
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:35,599
It is the season of the heart

668
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,438
A special time of caring

669
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,393
The ways of love made clear

670
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,149
It is the season of the spirit

671
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,192
The message, if we hear it

672
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,869
Is make it last all year

673
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,634
It's in the singing
of a street corner choir

674
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,433
It's going home
and getting warm by the fire

675
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,392
It's true
wherever you find love

676
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,908
It feels like Christmas

677
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:15,593
It's true
wherever you find love

678
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,790
It feels like

679
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,431
Christmas

680
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:27,833
It feels like Christmas

681
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,553
It feels like Christmas

682
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:41,359
It feels like Christmas

683
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,671
Spirit. I had no idea.

684
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,349
I wish to see friends. Kin.
Show me family.

685
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,351
It's... It's Fred.

686
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,188
My dear nephew Fred and his wife Clara
having Christmas with friends.

687
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,669
- Hey. Iook! Fruit!
- Well. There now!

688
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,631
We've had the plum pudding and sung
the carols.

689
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,631
- What now. My lovelies?
- A game. Fred.

690
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,790
Yeah. We must have
a game at Christmas.

691
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,190
- Do people play games at Christmas?
- I love games!

692
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,151
Say. Do you know
that fruit is wax?

693
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,232
Oh. Yeah.
I wondered about the texture.

694
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,748
- Let's play "Yes and No."
- A wonderful game!

695
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:21,310
- Oh. Yes!
- Ah! That's a great game! I'll be it.

696
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,039
Yes. Let Fred be it.
He always thinks of good things.

697
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,310
I do have a good one. Clara.
Guess!

698
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,198
- Is it vegetable?
- No.

699
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,673
- Mineral?
- No.

700
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,870
- Animal. Then?
- What else?
- What else. Indeed!

701
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,388
- Is it found on a farm?
- Never.

702
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,630
- In the city?
- Usually.

703
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,831
- Does it pull a hansom cab?
- Certainly not!

704
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,911
How about a dog?

705
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:43,949
- No.
- A cat?

706
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,110
- A cat?
- I said it first.

707
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,752
No.

708
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,832
Wait. Then.
Is this an unwanted creature?

709
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,751
- Often.
- A mouse.

710
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,949
- No.
- A rat.

711
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,031
- You called?
- A cockroach.

712
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,712
- No.
- A leech.

713
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,910
- Oh. Dear. It's too wonderful.
- Wait! Wait! I know!

714
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,993
An unwanted creature.
but not a rat. A leech or cockroach.

715
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,871
- Then what?
- Then what?
- What?

716
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,911
- It's Ebenezer Scrooge!
- Yes!

717
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,869
Wonderful!

718
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,229
- Yes!
- That's a good one!
- That's a killer!

719
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,312
Come.
There's much to see.

720
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,591
No more.
I wish to see no more.

721
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,591
Here.

722
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,989
Why have we come to
this odd corner of the town?

723
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,112
It's Christmas here. Too. You know.

724
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,469
That's Bob Cratchit's house.

725
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,909
Perhaps it was the spirit's
own generous nature...

726
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,871
and his sympathy
for all poor men...

727
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,993
that led them straight to the home
of Scrooge's faithful clerk.

728
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,428
Goose!
They're cookin' goose down there!

729
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,078
- Rizzo. Get out of the way!
- Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey!

730
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,112
Don't be sweeping the chimney now.
You're blockin' the smell!

731
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,188
This is Bob Cratchit's house?

732
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,992
- How do you know that?
- You just told me.

733
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,791
Well. I'm usually trustworthy.

734
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,039
- Who's that?
- Mrs Cratchit. Of course!

735
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:29,152
Peter. Do not stop turning that spit.

736
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,152
That is the whole secret
of a properly roasted goose.

737
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,872
It smells so good. Mother.

738
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,388
It does. Doesn't it?

739
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,629
Oh. That smells wonderful!

740
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,989
Oh. Good grief!

741
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,190
Hey. I'm stuck.
Get me outta here.

742
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,151
I knew you weren't
suited for literature.

743
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,750
At least I landed
on something soft.

744
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,992
And hot!
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

745
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,829
Mother. Mother. Mother! I thought
you said we couldn't eat the chestnuts...

746
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,912
until Father and Tiny Tim get home.

747
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,791
l-l-I wasn't eating them.

748
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,350
I was... I was merely checking them
to see if they were not burnt.

749
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,710
It's a chef's thing. Dear.
And do not shout. Betina.

750
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,911
- I'm Belinda!
- I'm Betina!

751
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,951
Of course you are. Betina.

752
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,390
- Belinda!
- Whatever.

753
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,072
- Hmmph!
- Hmmph!

754
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,989
'Tis the season
to bejolly and joyous

755
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,359
Fa la la

756
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,472
With a burst of pleasure
we feel it arrive

757
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,272
Fa la la

758
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,869
It's a season when
the saints can employ us

759
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,949
Fa la la

760
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,271
To spread the news about peace
and to keep love alive

761
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,352
- Come on. Son.
- Yeah.

762
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,112
Let's go see
if Christmas dinner is ready yet.

763
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,111
- Oh. Yeah.
- Yes.

764
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,191
Careful.

765
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,709
Merry Christmas. Everyone.

766
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,830
Daddy!

767
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,791
Merry Christmas. Girls.
Merry Christmas. Peter.

768
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,229
- Merry Christmas.
- Children. Children. Children!

769
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,880
Now... Now it's time to set the table.
Go ahead.

770
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,751
Wait for me!

771
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:24,033
- Merry Christmas. Emily.
- Merry Christmas. Cratchie.

772
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,638
- Emmie!
- Hmm?

773
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,393
I fell down the chimney and landed
on a flaming hot goose.

774
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,351
You have all the fun.

775
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,032
What?

776
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,759
Oh. Peter!
The Christmas dinner!

777
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,711
The goose!
The goose!

778
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,590
Oh. No. No. Now. Son. Son.
now you've gotten too excited.

779
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,992
You go sit in your chair a moment.
Okay. Rest. Rest a moment.

780
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:57,510
- How was he at church?
- As good as gold and better.

781
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,438
He told me that he hoped the people
saw him in church because...

782
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,631
it might be pleasant for them
to remember upon Christmas Day...

783
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,070
who made lame beggars walk
and blind men see.

784
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,718
A remarkable child!

785
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,233
And with that. The Cratchits
came to what was surely...

786
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,273
the happiest single moment
in all the livelong year.

787
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,233
- Such a meagre feast.
- But very much appreciated.

788
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,389
I pay Bob such a small amount.

789
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,391
- Mr Scrooge!
- Bob!

790
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,471
Bob Cratchit!

791
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,472
It only seems right that I should
lift a glass to my employer.

792
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,432
I give you Mr Scrooge.
the founder of the feast.

793
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,358
- The founder of the feast. Indeed!
- Hmmph!

794
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,109
If I had him here. I would give him
a piece of my mind to feast upon.

795
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,031
And I bet he would
choke on it. Hmm!

796
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,792
- Choke!
- Choke!
- My dear!

797
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,519
The... The children!
Christmas Day!

798
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:52,269
Well. I suppose that
on the blessed day of Christmas...

799
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:55,670
one must drink to the health
of. Uh. Mr Scrooge.

800
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,354
- Even though he is odious. Stingy...
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

801
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,789
- Wicked and unfeeling...
- Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!

802
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,512
and badly dressed...

803
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,309
- And...
- To the founder of the feast. Mr Scrooge!

804
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,191
To Mr Scrooge.

805
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:12,028
He'll be very merry and happy
this day. I have no doubt.

806
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,389
- No doubt.
- Cheers!

807
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,838
God bless us. Every one!

808
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,559
Life is full of sweet surprises

809
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,989
Every day's a gift

810
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,679
The sun comes up
and I can feel it

811
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,393
Lift my spirit

812
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,510
Fills me up with laughter

813
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,478
Fills me up with song

814
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,239
I look into the eyes of love

815
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,909
And know that I belong

816
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,110
Bless us all

817
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,913
Who gather here

818
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:54,239
The loving family I hold dear

819
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,748
No place on earth

820
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,559
Compares with home

821
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:05,232
And every path will bring me back
from where I roam

822
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,510
Bless us all

823
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,194
That as we live

824
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:15,633
We always comfort and forgive

825
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,274
We have so much

826
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,039
That we can share

827
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:26,029
With those in need
we see around us everywhere

828
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,993
Let us always love each other

829
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,789
Lead us to the light

830
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:40,958
Let us hear the voice of reason

831
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:45,271
Singing in the night

832
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:50,471
Let us run from anger

833
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,438
And catch us when we fall

834
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,191
Teach us in our dreams

835
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,431
And please, yes, please

836
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,278
Bless us one and all

837
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,870
Bless us all

838
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,480
With playful years

839
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:19,913
With noisy games and joyful tears

840
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,554
We reach for you

841
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,273
And we stand tall

842
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:30,713
And in our prayers and dreams
we ask you bless us all

843
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,479
We reach for you

844
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,229
And we stand tall

845
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,078
And in our prayers and dreams

846
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:45,752
We ask you bless us all

847
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,869
Let's all take our seats now.
Let's have dinner.

848
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:58,629
Spirit. Tell me if
Tiny Tim will live.

849
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,711
That is the future.

850
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,030
My realm is the present.

851
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:07,949
However. Ah. I see a vacant seat
by the chimney corner...

852
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,594
and a crutch
without an owner.

853
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,108
If these shadows
remain unaltered...

854
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,072
I believe the child will die.

855
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,998
What then? If he's going to die.
he had better do it...

856
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,679
and decrease
the surplus population.

857
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,992
Oh. Spirit.

858
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,674
As the Cratchit family
vanished into the darkness...

859
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,952
Scrooge kept his eyes
upon Tiny Tim until the last.

860
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,953
Come. My time grows short.

861
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,749
- Spirit. Do you grow old?
- I do.

862
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,471
Are spirits' lives so short?

863
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,632
My time upon this globe is very brief.

864
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:57,999
I believe it will end
upon the stroke of 12.00.

865
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,508
Uh! One.

866
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:05,071
Now? But. Spirit. I have
learned so much from you.

867
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,312
- Three.
- Nothing Scrooge could do or say
could stop the relentless march...
- Four.

868
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,033
- Of those terrible bells.
- Five.

869
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,469
Oh. Spirit. Do not leave me.

870
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,028
I think I must. In fact.

871
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,112
You have meant so much to me.
You have changed me.

872
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:25,870
And now I leave you with the Ghost
of Christmas Yet to Come.

873
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,911
You mean the future?

874
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:34,629
- Must I?
- Go forth and know him better. Man!

875
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,272
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

876
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,591
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

877
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,031
Am I in the presence...

878
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,190
of the Ghost of Christmas
Yet to Come?

879
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,109
Spirit. I fear you more...

880
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,794
than any spectre I have yet met.

881
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,310
Oh. This is too scary. I don't think
I want to see any more.

882
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,032
Oh. When you're right.
you're right.

883
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,389
You're on your own. Folks.
We'll meet you at the finale.

884
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,079
- Yeah. Oh!
- Ah!

885
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,913
I am prepared to follow
and to learn...

886
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,951
with a thankful heart.

887
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,392
Will you not speak to me?

888
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,312
Oh. Yes. Yes.
The night is waning fast.

889
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,912
Lead on. Spirit.

890
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,240
No. I don't know much about it
either way.

891
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,350
I only know he's dead.

892
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,710
- Yeah.
- When?
- Last night. I believe.

893
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,352
- Hmm. Wonder what he died of.
- Mm!

894
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,159
I thought he'd never go.

895
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,839
Well. I don't know or care
why he's gone.

896
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,950
I'd just like to know what
he's done with his money.

897
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,390
- That's right!
- Wouldn't we all?
- Well. He didn't give it to me.

898
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:50,069
- No. No.
- No!
- Well. It's likely to be a cheap funeral.

899
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,873
I don't know a single soul
who'd go to it.

900
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,070
- I wouldn't mind goin'.
- Hey?
- What?

901
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,714
If lunch is provided.

902
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,752
- I say!
- Speaking of lunch...

903
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:03,149
Oh. Good Lord.
Look at the time.

904
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,191
Yes. We must be off.

905
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,671
I know some of those gentlemen. Spirit.
Of what poor wretch do they speak?

906
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,948
So. Back from the house
of sadness. I see.

907
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,669
Huh! Sad that he didn't die years ago.
the old skinflint.

908
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,790
- Hear. Hear!
- Well. Let me see.

909
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,030
What do you got
for old Joe. Eh?

910
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:40,908
What do you got for me
to remember him by?

911
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,190
Joe. Get off!

912
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,592
Well. I got these collar buttons
from his dresser.

913
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,911
- Mother-of-pearl.
- No. No. No. No.

914
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,951
I got his bed curtains.

915
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,429
- Very fine damask.
- Oh.

916
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:59,638
Very cheap damask.
but worth a few coins.

917
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:03,719
- Now. I've got his blankets.
- Oh. His blankets?

918
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,752
Why. Mrs Dilber.
they're still warm.

919
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,320
I don't pay extra
for the warmth. You know.

920
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,272
You should.
It's the only warmth he ever had.

921
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,072
Only warmth he ever had!

922
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,952
The only warmth
he ever had.

923
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,391
I understand. Spirit.

924
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,671
The case of this unhappy man
might be my own.

925
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,029
My-My life tends that way now.

926
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,672
Merciful heavens.

927
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,430
Let me see some tenderness
connected with this world...

928
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,631
or I'll be haunted by that
terrible conversation forever.

929
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,711
It's Bob Cratchit's house.

930
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,030
Oh. Yes. Spirit.

931
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,833
A place of joy and laughter.

932
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,871
Thank you
for bringing me here.

933
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,272
It's so quiet.

934
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,591
Why is it so quiet. Spirit?

935
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,191
Oh. Mother. You're crying again.

936
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,193
Oh. Um. No. It's just the lamplight
that hurts my eyes.

937
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,912
Oh.

938
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,952
Not Tiny Tim!

939
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,070
Th-There. There now.

940
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:41,152
My eyes get weak
in the... in the dim light.

941
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:44,118
I would not want to show
weak eyes to your father...

942
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,230
when he gets home
for anything in the world.

943
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,914
He... He should be back now.

944
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:53,670
I think he's walked a little slower
these past two evenings.

945
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,192
- Hello. My dears.
- D-Daddy.
- Oh.

946
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,158
- Hello. Girls. Hello. Peter.
- Hello.

947
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,272
Children. Please...
please go set the table.

948
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,191
Thank you.

949
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,232
- How was the churchyard?
- Oh. It'll be lovely. Emily.

950
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:13,959
It would have done you good
to see how green the place is.

951
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,672
l... I picked a spot for Tim
where he can see...

952
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,079
It-It's a spot on the hill...

953
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,350
and you can see
the ducks on the river.

954
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:28,551
- Tiny Tim...
- Tiny Tim always loved...

955
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,591
watching the ducks
on the river.

956
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,310
Oh. Spirit. Must there
be a Christmas...

957
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,351
that brings this awful scene?

958
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,630
How can they endure it?

959
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,192
It's all right. Children.

960
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,268
Life is made up of meetings and partings.
That is the way of it.

961
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:56,591
I am sure we shall never forget
Tiny Tim...

962
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:59,353
or this first parting
that there was among us.

963
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,870
Must we return
to this place?

964
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,791
There's something else
that I must know...

965
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,871
is that not true?

966
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,072
Spirit. I know
what I must ask.

967
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,998
I fear to. But I must.

968
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,991
Who was the wretched man
whose death brought so much...

969
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,071
glee and happiness to others?

970
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,471
Answer me one more question.

971
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,154
Are these the shadows
of things that will be...

972
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,509
or are they the shadows
of things that may be only?

973
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,910
These events can be changed.

974
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,110
A life can be made right.

975
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,514
"Ebenezer Scrooge."

976
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:06,949
Oh. Please. Spirit. No.

977
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,639
Hear me.
I'm not the man I was.

978
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:14,073
Why would you show me this
if I was past all hope?

979
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,039
l... I will honour Christmas
and try to keep it all the year.

980
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:26,592
I will live my life in the past.
the present and the future.

981
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:30,150
I will not shut out the lessons
the spirits have taught me.

982
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:33,391
Tell me that I may sponge out
the writing on this stone.

983
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,678
Oh. Spirit. Please speak to me.

984
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,632
I'm home.

985
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,871
Yes. The bedposts were his own.

986
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,952
The bed was his own.
The room was his own.

987
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,151
- Hi. Guys! We're back.
- We promised we would be.
- Mm-hmm.

988
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,350
But the thing that made Scrooge
happiest of all...

989
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:17,592
was that his life lay before him
and it could be changed.

990
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:20,990
I will live my life in the past.
the present and the future.

991
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,429
Oh. Jacob and Robert Marley...

992
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,239
Oh. Heaven and the Christmas time
be praised for this day.

993
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:29,511
I say it on my knees. Jacob and Robert.
On my knees.

994
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:33,269
Oh. They're not torn down.
They're here.

995
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,920
And I'm here.
More is the miracle.

996
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,152
Oh! Oh.

997
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,960
I don't know what to do.
l-I'm as light as a feather.

998
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,151
I'm as happy as an angel.
I'm... I'm as merry as a schoolboy.

999
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,913
Um. Do you think it's safe
for us to be up here?

1000
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,270
- Scrooge is saved.
What can happen now?
- Yeah.

1001
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:59,628
- You there. Boy.
- What. Me?

1002
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,752
Uh. That is. What. Me. Sir?

1003
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,552
- What's today?
- Pardon?

1004
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,631
What's today. My fine fellow?

1005
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:09,274
Today? Well. Today
is Christmas Day.

1006
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,073
It's Christmas Day?
I haven't missed it.

1007
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:15,829
The spirits did it all in one night.
They can do anything they like.

1008
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,390
- Of course they can.
Of course they can.
- Uh. Of course they can.

1009
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:22,233
- Do you know the poultry shop
in the next street?
- Yes. Sir. I do.

1010
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:26,239
An intelligent lad.
A remarkable lad.

1011
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:29,078
Do you know whether the prize turkey
has been sold in the window?

1012
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,112
Oh. The one twice as big as me?
It's still there.

1013
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,628
Oh. It's a pleasure
talking with you. Lad.

1014
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,551
- Go and buy it.
- Be serious.

1015
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,632
I am being serious. Buy it for me.
and I'll give you a shilling.

1016
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,319
- Oh!
- No. I'll give you five shillings.
- What?

1017
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,998
- Wow!
- And so the boy was off like a shot.

1018
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,270
- So eager...
- Wah!

1019
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,709
Um. Sorry.

1020
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:56,069
I'll bring it to Bob Cratchit's house.
What a surprise it'll be.

1021
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,270
It's twice the size of Tiny Tim.

1022
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,312
And a few moments later.
dressed in his finest...

1023
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,709
Scrooge appeared
on the streets of the city...

1024
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,679
to wish "Merry Christmas"
to all the world.

1025
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,472
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1026
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:11,232
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1027
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,590
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

1028
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,511
Gee. Thanks.

1029
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:21,189
Everyone was out and about
this fine morning...

1030
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,192
and soon he encountered
two familiar faces.

1031
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,192
M-M-Mr Scrooge?

1032
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,748
Pardon me. Gentlemen. But about
the charity donation...

1033
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,592
- You asked me for yesterday.
- Oh. Yes?

1034
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,119
Put me down for...

1035
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:38,313
- That much?
- Not a penny less.

1036
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,193
A great many back payments
are included in it. I assure you.

1037
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:44,038
Oh. My goodness.
I don't know what to say.

1038
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,958
I just wish there was something
we could give you.

1039
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,391
A gift?

1040
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,032
A gift for me?

1041
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,591
Thank you.

1042
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,240
Thank you... 50 times.

1043
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:09,872
And a Merry Christmas.

1044
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,110
- Here's your turkey. Mr Scrooge.
- Follow me. Lad.

1045
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,670
With a thankful heart
With an endless joy

1046
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,149
With a growing family
Every girl and boy

1047
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,078
Will be nephew
and niece to me

1048
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,951
Nephew and niece to me

1049
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,753
Will bring love, hope
and peace to me

1050
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,870
Love, hope
and peace to me

1051
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:33,311
Yes, and every night will end
and every day will start

1052
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:37,313
With a grateful prayer
and a thankful heart

1053
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,550
With an open smile
and with open doors

1054
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,989
I will bid you welcome
What is mine is yours

1055
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,389
With a glass raised
to toast your health

1056
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,829
With a glass raised
to toast your health

1057
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,388
And a promise
to share the wealth

1058
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,471
A promise to share the wealth

1059
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,988
I will sail a friendly course

1060
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,071
File a friendly chart

1061
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:01,159
- On a sea of love and a thankful heart
- On a sea of love and a thankful heart

1062
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:04,590
Life is like a journey

1063
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,559
Who knows when it ends

1064
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,919
Yes, and if you need to know

1065
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,030
The measure of a man

1066
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:19,908
You simply count his friends

1067
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,629
Stop and look around you

1068
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:28,070
The glory that you see

1069
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,750
Is born again each day

1070
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,189
Don't let it slip away

1071
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,829
How precious life can be

1072
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,111
With a thankful heart
that is wide awake

1073
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,589
I do make this promise
Every breath I take

1074
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:30,313
Will be used now
to sing your praise

1075
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,590
Used now to sing your praise

1076
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,949
And to beg you
to share my days

1077
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,951
Beg you to share my days

1078
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,468
With a loving guarantee

1079
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,790
That even if we part

1080
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:45,549
- I will hold you close in a thankful heart
- I will hold you close in a thankful heart

1081
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,551
I will hold you close

1082
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,871
In a thankful heart

1083
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,511
In a thankful heart

1084
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,879
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh. Yes. Yes.

1085
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,990
Oh. Oh. Oh.
Oh. Yes.

1086
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,792
Bob Cratchit!

1087
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,909
- So here you are.
- Uh. M-M-Mr Scrooge. Uh...

1088
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,838
You. Sir. Were not at work this morning
as we had discussed.

1089
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,633
Oh. But-but. Mr Scrooge. Sir.
we did discuss it.

1090
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:29,750
It's Christmas Day.
You gave me the day off.

1091
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:33,150
I? I. Ebenezer Scrooge?

1092
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,191
- Would I do a thing like that?
- No.

1093
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,032
I mean yes.
But-But you did.

1094
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:38,911
Bob Cratchit.
I've had my fill of this.

1095
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,111
- And I have had my fill of you.
Mr Scrooge.
- Emily! Emily! Mr Scrooge.

1096
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:45,391
- And therefore. Bob Cratchit...
- And therefore. You can leave
this house at once!

1097
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,948
And therefore. I'm about
to raise your salary.

1098
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,790
- Oh! And I am about to raise you right
off the pavement and out... Pardon?
- Pardon?

1099
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,912
Yes. Bob. Raise your salary...

1100
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,798
and pay your mortgage
on this house.

1101
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,639
- Please. Sir. Come inside. Uh. Yes.
- Oh. Yes. Yes.

1102
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:06,353
Bob Cratchit. Would you
and your family...

1103
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:10,473
care to join us for a little turkey dinner
on this fine Christmas Day?

1104
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,351
Merry Christmas!

1105
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,591
- Ho-ho! Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas! Ho-ho-ho-ho!

1106
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:19,832
- Try a truffle?
- Oh. My goodness.
- I don't know...

1107
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,429
And Scrooge was
better than his word.

1108
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,159
He did it all
and infinitely more!

1109
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,350
And. Uh. Tiny Tim?

1110
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:33,672
- And Tiny Tim. Who did not die...
- Aw. Isn't that swell!

1111
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,070
To Tiny Tim. Scrooge
became a second father.

1112
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,749
He became as good a friend.
as good a master and as good a man...

1113
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,268
- As the good old city ever had!
- Hmm.

1114
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:46,432
And It was always said of him that he
knew how to keep Christmas well...

1115
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,789
if any man alive
possessed the knowledge.

1116
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:52,799
May that truly be said of us.
and all of us!

1117
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:55,308
And so.
as Tiny Tim observed...

1118
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,112
God bless us.

1119
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,668
God bless us. Every one!

1120
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:04,791
The love we found

1121
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:08,310
The love we found

1122
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,510
We carry with us

1123
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:15,680
So we're never
quite alone

1124
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:19,110
The love we found

1125
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:22,789
The love we found

1126
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,440
The sweetest dream

1127
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:29,632
That we have ever known

1128
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:33,713
- Hey! See ya later!
- Goodbye!
- The love we found

1129
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:37,309
The love we found

1130
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,749
- We carry with us
- Bye-bye!
- Goodbye!

1131
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:44,954
So we're never
quite alone

1132
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,309
- Nice story. Mr Dickens.
- Oh. Thanks.

1133
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,994
- Lf you like this.
you should read the book.
- Ho-ho-ho-ho!

1134
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,679
It's in the singing
of a street corner choir

1135
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:55,632
- It's going home and getting warm
by the fire
- Merry Christmas!

1136
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,478
It's true
wherever you find love

1137
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:01,193
- It feels like Christmas
- Yes. It does!

1138
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:03,470
The cup of kindness
that we share with another

1139
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,472
- A sweet reunion with a friend
or a brother
- Hello!

1140
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,279
In all the places
you find love

1141
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:12,471
It feels like Christmas

1142
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:16,513
It is the season of the heart

1143
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,472
A special time of caring

1144
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:23,109
The ways of love made clear

1145
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:27,472
And it is
the season of the spirit

1146
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:30,028
The message
if we hear it

1147
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:33,999
Is make it last all year

1148
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,190
Ho-ho-ho! Yes!

1149
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,470
- Make it last all year.
- So we give our gift to another

1150
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:44,432
- A pair of mittens that were
made by your mother
- Merry Christmas!

1151
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:47,313
- It's all the ways that we show love
- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

1152
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,749
- That feel like Christmas
- Yes.

1153
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,479
A part of childhood
we'll always remember

1154
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,193
- It is the summer of the soul
in December
- Bye-bye!

1155
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:58,118
- Yes, when you do your best for love
- Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas!

1156
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:01,232
- It feels like Christmas
- And remember...

1157
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:05,319
It is the season of the heart

1158
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,158
A special time of caring

1159
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:12,079
The ways of love made clear

1160
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:16,113
It is the season of the spirit

1161
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,833
The message
if we hear it

1162
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:22,839
Is make it last all year

1163
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:26,270
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

1164
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,588
Yes!

1165
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:30,279
It's in the singing
of a street corner choir

1166
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,993
It's going home and getting
warm by the fire

1167
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,918
It's true
wherever you find love

1168
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:38,428
It feels like Christmas

1169
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:45,312
It's true
wherever you find love

1170
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,550
It feels like

1171
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,068
Christmas

1172
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,151
It feels like Christmas

1173
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,873
It feels like Christmas

1174
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,639
It feels like Christmas

1175
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:03,118
- It feels like Christmas!
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
- It feels like Christmas

1176
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:13,149
It feels like Christmas

1177
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:16,909
There comes a moment
in your life

1178
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,993
Like a window
and you see

1179
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:24,430
Your future there before you

1180
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:28,229
And how perfect
life can be

1181
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,470
But adventure calls

1182
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:36,032
With unknown voices
calling you away

1183
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:39,829
Be careful
or you may regret

1184
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:44,510
The choice you make someday

1185
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:48,269
When love is gone

1186
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:52,069
When love is gone

1187
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:54,918
The sweetest dream

1188
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:59,272
That we have ever known

1189
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:03,319
When love is gone

1190
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:07,069
When love is gone

1191
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,111
I wish you well

1192
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:14,433
But I must leave you now alone

1193
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:18,268
It was almost love

1194
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:21,949
It was almost always

1195
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,912
It was like a fairy tale

1196
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,669
We'd live out
you and I

1197
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:32,673
And, yes, some dreams
come true

1198
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:37,111
Yes, some dreams
fall through

1199
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:40,789
And, yes, the time
has come for us

1200
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,952
To say goodbye

1201
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,629
Yes, some dreams
come true

1202
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:52,748
Yes, some dreams
fall through

1203
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,951
Yes, the time has come
for us

1204
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:03,111
To say goodbye
