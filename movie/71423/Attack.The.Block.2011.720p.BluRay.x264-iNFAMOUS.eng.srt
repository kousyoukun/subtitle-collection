1
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,296
Hi, Mum.

2
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:02,676
Sorry, I couldn't call sooner.
Haven't had the chance.

3
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:12,171
No, I'm just walking back to the flat
My shift ran over.

4
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,293
Loads of kids with firework burns.

5
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:23,002
How's Dad?

6
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:32,090
What about next weekend?

7
00:02:32,124 --> 00:02:34,541
I could take the train up, stay the night

8
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,047
I'll call you on Sunday.
We'll make a plan.

9
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,794
Gotta go now.

10
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,965
OK. Bye.

11
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,878
Go on, man.

12
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,961
Hey, cut across her.

13
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,260
Oh, fuck.

14
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,292
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
Give me the phone!

15
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,843
The money, the purse.
Give me the purse, give it to me.

16
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,587
Don't fuck about.

17
00:03:35,624 --> 00:03:37,627
Hey. Please.

18
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,337
Give me that ring.
It's not worth...

19
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:42,377
Shut up. Wanna get murked, innit?

20
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,878
Stupid...
Get off me!

21
00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:51,294
Oh!
Oi, what?

22
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:56,127
Boy, you're too brave.
Quick, fam, 'fore the feds come.

23
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,635
Fuck the feds, man.

24
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,839
Take it.

25
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,378
Look, man. Look.

26
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,630
Fuck!

27
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,634
Oi, she's duckin'.
Hey, fam, she's ghostin'.

28
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,922
Allow it.
Somebody's bombin' us, blood.

29
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,459
No, man, it's just a firework.
Some big firework.

30
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,626
Nice whip.
Could be bare valuables in there.

31
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:50,385
Raargh!

32
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,170
Shit. There's something...
Whoa!

33
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:05,050
What the fuck was that?

34
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,844
Some orang-utan type thing,
I'm not even lying, bruv.

35
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,836
Hey, it's breezin', man.
It looked like Dobby the house elf.

36
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:13,375
Moses got shanked by a Dobby.

37
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:17,207
I'm chasing that down. I'm killing that.

38
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,209
Watch.

39
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:21,583
Payback, fam.
I'm proper stampin' that.

40
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:24,586
It's gone in adventure.
Round two, bruv. Round two.

41
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,543
Playtime, bruv.

42
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,760
I got my tool.

43
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,552
No man stunting.
I'm gonna fuck this thing up!

44
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,301
Yo, you got beef now, Moses.

45
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,836
Yo, Pest, got them bangers?
Yeah.

46
00:05:44,874 --> 00:05:46,544
Jam, man.

47
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,885
It's mine.

48
00:06:06,124 --> 00:06:08,802
Hey, back me! Back me!

49
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:23,842
Ah, no, man, that is rank.
Hey, we broke it up.

50
00:06:23,874 --> 00:06:27,085
What is that, cuz?
That ain't no is. That's a was.

51
00:06:27,124 --> 00:06:29,671
I told you, some exotic creature,
like a monkey thing.

52
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,884
That fell out of the sky. You trying to
tell me it's raining monkeys?

53
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,965
That ain't no monkey.
Monkeys ain't bald.

54
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:37,630
No, that's some weird thing.
I don't know what that is.

55
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,048
I ain't even gonna say.
You know what that is?

56
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,128
I'll tell you what that is.
That's a alien, bruv. Believe it.

57
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,962
It must have come from outer space,
trying to take over Earth.

58
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:48,251
But it landed in the wrong place.

59
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,294
The wrong place!

60
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,260
Welcome to London, mo fucker.
Welcome to the ends, brother.

61
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:56,384
This is the block. And nobody fucks
with the block, do you get me?

62
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,047
The B-L-O-C-K.

63
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:02,128
Brap. Brap. Brap. Brap. Brap...

64
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,880
You all right, love?
Not really.

65
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,004
Do you live here?
Yeah.

66
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,423
Come along, I'll take you home.
Thank you.

67
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,425
Come on.

68
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,758
You poor thing.
Pale as a ghost, you were.

69
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,374
Must have given you such a nasty shock.

70
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,675
You sure you don't want a cup of tea?
No, thanks. Water's fine.

71
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,464
Bloody fireworks.

72
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,927
I think they should ban them.

73
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:34,300
Could be the third world war out there,
you wouldn't know the difference.

74
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,336
What did the police say?

75
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:42,211
Said it was one of the busiest nights
of the year. Bet they don't even turn up.

76
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,051
Only it's not like the kids
are scared of 'em no more.

77
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,591
Walking around with knives,
great big dogs, like they own the block.

78
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:53,630
Excuse my French, but they're
fucking monsters, ain't they?

79
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,089
Yeah. Fucking monsters.

80
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,423
..its ribs and that.
Have you found anything?

81
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,880
I beg you give me two pound
to go to Chicken World, fam.

82
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,427
That's disgusting.

83
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,461
Moses,
where are we gonna take that thing?

84
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,586
Take it to Ron's. He watches
that National Geographic shit.

85
00:09:12,624 --> 00:09:14,958
All man ever does is blaze,

86
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:17,381
water them big buds
and watch the nature channel.

87
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,675
He'll identify that thing for real.
Let me bell him up.

88
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:23,545
It was madness, fam.
The beast of Brixton.

89
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,467
We were crazy kicking that.

90
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,958
No, Mum. Playing football.

91
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:32,760
Yeah, I had pepperoni pizza.
You gave me the money.

92
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,587
Some kind of
non-found-out-about creature.

93
00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:37,461
Yeah, like Some Gears Of War thing.

94
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:41,380
Yes, I know. Back by ten.
I swear, Mum, back by ten.

95
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:45,422
Ah, she's a nurse.
They don't get paid nothing, fam.

96
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,587
Oi, Moses. Why you always picking
the poor people, man?

97
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,544
Hey, let's walk, bruv.
Whoo!

98
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,343
Woy.

99
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:14,177
Moses, what happened to your face?
Battled an alien that fell from the sky.

100
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,926
You're funny.
Eurgh, what is that?

101
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,628
I'm sorry, I can't even look at that.

102
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,546
Halloween was last week.
That ain't real. That's a creation.

103
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,420
Touch it.
Shove that thing in my face

104
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,591
and them fangs are going up in your tits.

105
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,669
Move it from me. Grow up.
Could be diseased, you get me?

106
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:30,759
I don't want no chlamydia.

107
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,125
So you're telling me
that fell out of the sky?

108
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,667
Yeah.
And did that to your face?

109
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,965
Yeah.
So, you killed lt?

110
00:10:39,624 --> 00:10:40,833
Yeah.

111
00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:43,842
Such a bad breed, Moses.

112
00:10:45,624 --> 00:10:47,627
Fuck! It's alive!

113
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:53,000
Tia is moving to you, Moses.
She's on your balls, cuz.

114
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,542
Hey, that's my cousin
you're chatting about.

115
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,965
Hey, man.
Hey, hey, hey, watch this jump.

116
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,676
Get down, man.

117
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:03,166
Trust, I can do it.
Humpty-Dumpty.

118
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,886
We ain't cleanin' your guts off the floor,
Biggz. Come on.

119
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,382
Oh, I swear I could do that.
Yeah, yeah, sure you can, man.

120
00:11:16,124 --> 00:11:18,671
Oi, Gavin, you pyro.
My name ain't Gavin.

121
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:20,586
It's Mayhem and he's Probs.

122
00:11:20,624 --> 00:11:23,420
Probs and Mayhem? Seriously?

123
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,041
Urgh, what is that?
That's none of your business.

124
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,630
That's sick, man.

125
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,550
Where you going?
Let us come with you.

126
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,463
Yeah, Moses, let us roll with you.
We're bad boys.

127
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,634
Go away. This is big man business.
You're too tiny.

128
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,297
Yeah, get in touch
when you get your first pube.

129
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,624
Go suck your mum.

130
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,882
Oooh!
Whoo!

131
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,541
~Whoop whoop,
that's the sound of da police

132
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,917
~Whoop whoop,
that's the sound of the beast

133
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,375
~Whoop whoop,
that's the sound of da police

134
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,798
~Whoop whoop,
that's the sound of the beast

135
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,760
~Whoop whoop,
that's the sound of da police

136
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,884
~Whoop whoop, that's the sound of...

137
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,760
Hey, Dad.

138
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,836
Yeah, just on my way to the cinema.

139
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,380
Yes, I promise,
it'll be parked outside in the morning.

140
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,419
OK, Dad. Gotta go. Bye-bye.

141
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,593
I pressed it already. Taking 'nough time.

142
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,418
I'll... I'll just... I'll get the next one.

143
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:56,416
Express elevator
to the penthouse suite.

144
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,256
Do you remember
what they were wearing?

145
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,467
One of them had one of those
woolly hats with those tassels.

146
00:13:04,374 --> 00:13:07,135
<i>The one that pushed me over,
the main one,</i>

147
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,418
<i>had a black baseball cap
with a red brim.</i>

148
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,592
<i>That's all l can remember.</i>

149
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:15,634
<i>Did you see their faces?
Have you seen them around?</i>

150
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,751
<i>No. They had hoods and scarves.</i>

151
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,592
You want me to call the police?

152
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:22,385
The best thing is to come with us
for a drive around the block,

153
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,051
see if we can spot them.

154
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,168
Then we can drop you
with a friend afterwards.

155
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,594
No, thanks.

156
00:13:27,624 --> 00:13:30,753
I'm not gonna be scared out my own home
by a bunch of bloody teenagers.

157
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,259
Yo, Ron!

158
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,965
Yo, Ron!

159
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,292
All right?

160
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,794
No idea. Not a bloody clue.

161
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:52,000
Maybe there was a party at the zoo
and a monkey fucked a fish.

162
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,586
I saw them with it on the way up.

163
00:13:55,624 --> 00:13:59,546
Thought they'd won it at the funfair.
Smells real though, don't it?

164
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,586
Smells like a shit did a shit.

165
00:14:07,874 --> 00:14:10,552
You wanna buy a bit of weed, then?
Yeah.

166
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,130
Yeah, come on.

167
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,215
Shut up, man.

168
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:16,588
Well done, lads.

169
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:19,385
You've discovered a species
hitherto unknown to science,

170
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:23,883
quite possibly non-terrestrial in origin,
and you kicked its fucking head in.

171
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,756
Take a seat. I'll be back in a minute.
Yeah.

172
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,884
We're getting rich off that, you know,
cos we discovered it.

173
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,340
eBay, fam.
Alert the media.

174
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,293
Exclusive rights to the highest bidder.

175
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,134
The Sun. Believes anything.

176
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:41,377
No, no, no, no, no. The Sun'll dress it up
like one of them Page Three girls.

177
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,086
You wanna call The Guardian, blood.

178
00:14:43,124 --> 00:14:46,466
People will believe it in a proper paper.
No, tabloids pay more money.

179
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,793
You can't call the paper.
FBI will confiscate it.

180
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:52,044
FBI? This is England, there ain't no FBI.

181
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,086
It's Section Six or something.

182
00:14:54,124 --> 00:14:57,300
We need an expert to verify that thing.
Look in the Yellow Pages.

183
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,793
Look for scientist people who know
about all them meteor things.

184
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,250
Yellow Pages?
Like, what, "A" for aliens?

185
00:15:04,374 --> 00:15:06,009
Cheers.
We need a lawyer,

186
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,546
a manager or something.

187
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,751
Bell Simon Cowell. Alien's Got Talent.

188
00:15:13,124 --> 00:15:14,545
Jokes, man, jokes.

189
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,628
Actually, I did this zoology module at uni.

190
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,380
Primatology, mammalogy, all that shizzle.

191
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:28,587
That thing in there don't belong
to no taxon I've ever studied.

192
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:31,302
You met Brewis, then?
Very reliable customer.

193
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,336
Gwanin'.

194
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,759
Hey, move, blood!

195
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,459
Hey, hey!

196
00:15:39,624 --> 00:15:42,255
Allow it, allow it, allow it...

197
00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:46,302
Yo, Ron.
You want a bourbon?

198
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:50,006
Let me keep that thing in the weed room.
Could be worth bare money.

199
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,126
That's the safest place in the block.

200
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:57,416
Look, I'd love to, but it's not my decision.
I only work here.

201
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,461
Why don't you come and ask the boss?

202
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,042
What, Hi-Hatz is here?
Yeah, he's in the weed room.

203
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,086
Come on.

204
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,418
~Get That Snitch

205
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,836
Hi-Hatz.

206
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,005
Hi-Hatz!

207
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,586
Hi-Hatz!

208
00:16:26,874 --> 00:16:29,126
Yo, Moses, hear my beats?

209
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,297
Yeah.
Yeah, that's my new trick.

210
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,922
~Get that snitch
Get the strap

211
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,007
~Don't give a fuck
~Blat, blat, blat...

212
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,844
That's serious.

213
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,801
Ah, check it out, he's got a puppet.

214
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,175
You made that in college or something?

215
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,255
You got mad skills for puppets.

216
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,376
Looks proper rotten and everything.

217
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,632
Found it over the park,
didn't you, Moses?

218
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,420
He wants to know if he can keep it here.

219
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,128
He reckons it's worth bare money.

220
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,671
True say?

221
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,711
Yo, bring it, bring it, bring it.

222
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,422
<i>~Get that snitch

00:17:28,624 --> 00:17:30,425
Yo. Do whatever you want.

229
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,176
I don't care about that bullshit.

230
00:17:35,874 --> 00:17:37,509
You shot my food from Ron still?

231
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,135
Sometimes.

232
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,459
There's better ways to make P's
in the ends, you know.

233
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:47,923
Man of your age should step his game up.
Move some white.

234
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:53,002
I'm gonna put you on bail.

235
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,467
Get me 300 back from this.

236
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,510
You're my boy now.

237
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:05,963
One thing, though.
This is my block, get me?

238
00:18:10,874 --> 00:18:12,923
<i>The female lands.</i>

239
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,631
<i>If this new territory is hospitable,
she releases a pheromone</i>

00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:20,423
<i>which can be detected by the male

241
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,295
Brewis.

242
00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:24,128
Oi, Brewis.

243
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,215
Oi, come on.

244
00:18:26,249 --> 00:18:27,967
You all right?

245
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:29,420
Yes, fam.

246
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:36,043
What you on about, man?
Oh, fam, boy.

247
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:39,834
I know, fam.

248
00:18:39,874 --> 00:18:42,801
Hey, what, bruv?
Hey, why are you smiling, bruv?

249
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,966
Hey, what's that?
Hey, I bet he got a job.

250
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,167
Eh, is it?
He got recruited, innit.

251
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,878
What's that in your pocket, bruv?

252
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,381
Hi-Hatz is gonna step you up.

253
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,166
What's that?
What's that in your pocket, man?

254
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,593
Yo, check it.

255
00:19:04,624 --> 00:19:06,958
What, bruv?
More.

256
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:09,002
More what?
Them tings.

257
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,510
It's just rockets, innit?

258
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,672
Nah. Rockets go up
before they come down.

259
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,960
Them things are pure comin' down.

260
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,961
They're the same.
Same as what?

261
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:22,002
As what hit that car before, fam.
Trust.

262
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,008
Nah. More of them nasty little gremlins.

263
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,672
It's raining Gollums.
Bare creatures.

264
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,420
Hey, that one landed in the park, fam, close.

265
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,717
Oh, lovely fireworks.
Nah, mate, it's a alien invasion.

266
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,173
Course it is.
Let's get down there, cuz.

267
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,088
Let's go fuck them up!
I'm killin' them straight

268
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:42,217
Ay, let's get tooled up, blood.
Come, come.

269
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:44,086
Ay, somebody call pest control?

270
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,625
Quite sweet really, aren't they?

271
00:20:00,124 --> 00:20:02,802
Hi.
Emergency situation! Move, move!

272
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,843
Don't shove us!
Some of us have got exams tomorrow!

273
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:19,052
Where have you been?
Got to get the puncture repair kit.

274
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:22,377
Why? You're not going out again.
Just to mend my tyre. Ten minutes.

275
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,047
Hey. Ten minutes, I mean it.
I promise.

276
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:33,921
What happened to your leg?

277
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,423
Nothing, Nan.
I pulled a muscle playing football.

278
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,796
Back in a bit, Nan.
Now, don't you go getting into trouble.

279
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,836
Course not, Nan.

280
00:21:01,374 --> 00:21:03,211
Dennis, where are you going?
Out!

281
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:05,465
Then take your dog.
No, man, I'm busy.

282
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:07,797
I'm not asking, I'm telling.

283
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:12,300
Pogo. Come, come, come.
Come, let's go savage some Gollums.

284
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,294
Whoa! Let's go!

285
00:21:44,624 --> 00:21:46,045
Go, go, go!

286
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,425
Hey, Moses, what's happening?
Wait for us.

287
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:53,131
Wait. It's not fair, man.
We wanna come too.

288
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,051
Hey, what, the Dobbies came again.

289
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,714
There might be something in it.
Set the grass on fire.

290
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,426
Messed up, man.
I told you, fam.

291
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:03,172
A meteor, for real.
Ay, loads came down, innit.

292
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,424
We gotta take them all out.
Gotta catch them all.

293
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,591
Calm down, Biggz, this ain't Pokémon.

294
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:14,592
Yo, shine the light.

295
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:27,050
Like a fossil, innit.
No, that's different.

296
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,671
That ain't even the same thing.

297
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,462
That looks triple the size, blood.

298
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:35,502
I'd like to see the brother who'd fight that.

299
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:39,589
Right now, I feel like going home,
locking my door and playing FIFA.

300
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,592
Hey, what was that?

301
00:22:43,624 --> 00:22:45,958
Pogo. Pogo, whoa. Stay.

302
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:47,125
Stay.

303
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:51,505
There.
Holy fuck.

304
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,550
Where, fam? Where?
On top of the tower.

305
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:56,297
Which tower?
Ain't you got your contacts in? Look.

306
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,212
Pogo! Pogo!

307
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:05,458
No, man!

308
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:11,254
What's it doing? Where's it gone, man?

309
00:23:14,374 --> 00:23:15,962
It's coming.

310
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,967
Ah, I can see its eyes.
Not sure them things is eyes.

311
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,883
Hey, let's bounce, bruv.
I'm gone, fam.

312
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,919
Everyone run!

313
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,461
Aliens! Run! Leave, leave, leave!

314
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:37,802
They say aliens?
That's what I heard, man.

315
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,836
Doughnuts.
They think we're scaredy-cats.

316
00:23:39,874 --> 00:23:41,711
Look, man.

317
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:42,963
Shit, man!

318
00:23:50,874 --> 00:23:52,877
Hey, come on, Biggz, man.

319
00:23:57,499 --> 00:23:59,300
Bully van!

320
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,797
Stay down! Come here!

321
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,261
Give me your hand! Give me your hand!

322
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:33,500
Man, fuck the five-o!
Stay down, stay down.

323
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,709
Hey, calm.

324
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:41,677
We got wraps.

325
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:44,753
Mike Delta 4-0-3,
need assistance, Ballard Street.

326
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:47,801
You are under arrest on suspicion of...
Four-inch flick blade.

327
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:49,254
..possession of Class A drugs.

328
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:53,297
You do not have to say anything...

329
00:24:53,374 --> 00:24:54,713
Victim's mobile phone.

330
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:57,753
Anything you do say may be given in evidence.
Do you understand?

331
00:24:57,791 --> 00:25:00,208
Ballard Street, over.

332
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,417
He said, do you understand?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

333
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:04,963
Hurry up and get me in that van.

334
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:11,967
Are you absolutely positive that's him?
Positive.

335
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:15,258
And the rest of them are up on that walkway.
You know that, don't you?

336
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:18,468
He's brucking him in the van, bruv.

337
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:21,712
Behind the cars, check it.

338
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:30,587
Hey, where is it?
The roof, fam, clock that roof.

339
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:47,708
Control, re Ballard Street.
We got a prisoner coming in. 557, over.

340
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:56,631
Also, please advise,
er...four other suspects still in the area.

341
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:00,211
Not so tough now, are we, fella?

342
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:11,253
Aaargh! Aaargh!

343
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:18,795
Oh, shit!

344
00:26:29,874 --> 00:26:33,583
Nah. Feds got savaged.
Shit, man. We gotta back Moses.

345
00:26:33,624 --> 00:26:36,125
Fuck that, bruv.
I ain't going nowhere near none of that.

346
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:40,172
Think. Think what scared the little one.
Bangers ain't gonna do nothin', fam.

347
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:41,843
I ain't talking about bangers.

348
00:26:41,874 --> 00:26:44,126
Let me out, man!

349
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:45,587
Oh!

350
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:49,250
Hold it steady.
I ain't the one with the shakes.

351
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:51,459
Hurry up, man.
Come on, you lot, man.

352
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:03,298
Open the door! Let me out!

353
00:27:14,249 --> 00:27:15,670
Yo, cover me, fam.

354
00:27:27,874 --> 00:27:30,588
This is for Pogo. Rest in peace, dog.

355
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:52,961
What?

356
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:03,927
Took your time, man.

357
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:11,666
Dumb feds left the keys!
Then let's jack it!

358
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,919
Throw it off, man! Throw it off!

359
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:27,922
Yo, Biggz,
meet us at the underground garages.

360
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,550
Ire Feelings

361
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:39,297
~Skanga, skanga, skanga, skanga...

362
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:51,087
Fuck.

363
00:28:52,624 --> 00:28:55,504
Oh, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

364
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:06,216
Ron, it's Brewis.

365
00:29:06,249 --> 00:29:10,504
Mate, someone's like petrol-bombed
my dad's car or... I don't know.

366
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,135
And there's po-po everywhere.

367
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:14,797
<i>I need to come back up.
All right, calm down.</i>

368
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:17,133
I've got the binoculars out.
Where are ya?

369
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:20,093
I'm by the road by the park.
Behind a bush.

370
00:29:20,124 --> 00:29:22,091
<i>What can you see?</i>

371
00:29:22,124 --> 00:29:26,923
Couple of fire engines parked up
by the off-licence, and I think...

372
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,630
<i>Hang on. Fuck me.
What?</i>

373
00:29:31,374 --> 00:29:34,052
Blockbusters has shut down.

374
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:37,507
<i>Right. No police, though?
No, you're all right.</i>

375
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:40,130
Come back up. Not a blue light in sight.

376
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:57,837
Whoa!

377
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:05,922
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

378
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:08,174
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

379
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:11,301
This is a bad dream.
Tell me I'm dreaming.

380
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:15,301
Let me out! Open the door!

381
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:17,378
Wait, blood, wait, blood.

382
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:20,794
That ain't even police at the wheel,
that's youths in there.

383
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:25,625
What we gonna do, bruv?
Give me the strap.

384
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:29,377
Let me out! Open the door!

385
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:31,419
Open the door!

386
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:35,255
Sorry about the driving.
I'll get lessons for Christmas.

387
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,052
What were those things?
We're thinking probably aliens.

388
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:41,045
You should leave.
Before the situation gets more nuts.

389
00:30:42,624 --> 00:30:43,963
Go on, then.

390
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:50,376
Ain't you gonna thank us
for saving your life?

391
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:52,457
My fucking hero.

392
00:31:09,249 --> 00:31:11,583
Yo, Hi-Hatz, it was a accident.
Nah, trust, bruv.

393
00:31:11,624 --> 00:31:13,591
There's bare creatures chasing us.

394
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:16,171
Big alien-gorilla-wolf motherfuckers.
I swear.

395
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:20,000
Some creature fell from outer space
and jumped Moses, so he bored it.

396
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:22,506
And now its brethren
have come down in force, blood.

397
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:25,255
Moses got shiffed by the feds
and the things attacked the van

398
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:27,424
and savaged the bluefoot,
so we jacked the van.

399
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:30,172
We're running for our lives now, cuz.
Believe!

400
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:36,878
Jack a bully van, crash it into my whip
and then chat shit about aliens to me?

401
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:41,792
This is making me nervous, blood.
That boy's still cuffed, you know.

402
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,629
Police are gonna be all over this.
You trying to snake me?

403
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:53,585
What, you wanna bring arms to me now?
You wanna murk me?

404
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:58,794
You wanna war with me?
Listen to me, cuz, I'm not even lying.

405
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,124
If we was making it up,

406
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:02,844
don't you think we'd make up
something better than aliens?

407
00:32:02,874 --> 00:32:04,628
Say that word one more time.

408
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,504
I told you, bruv.
On the roof, if you don't believe me.

409
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:11,088
What? What's on the roof?

410
00:32:11,124 --> 00:32:12,593
One of them...
Say it!

411
00:32:12,624 --> 00:32:15,753
One of them big
gorilla-wolf motherfuckers.

412
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:21,465
Yo, Hi-Hatz, there is something there, bruv.

413
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:31,969
Yo, go see what that is.

414
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:34,002
No way, bruv.
Move!

415
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,628
Shit.

416
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:03,760
Yo, Hi-Hatz, bruv.

417
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:05,710
There's no...
Oh, shit!

418
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,675
Oh, shit!

419
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:16,924
Got the key to your lockup?
Yeah.

420
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:24,673
Follow me, follow me!

421
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:27,048
Moses! Pussyhole!

422
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,251
I'm gonna get you killed, blood! Watch!

423
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:37,842
I told you, man. Alien invasion.

424
00:33:37,874 --> 00:33:40,291
London-wide. For real.
I knew it from the start.

425
00:33:40,374 --> 00:33:41,843
Them vans got tracker beacons.

426
00:33:41,874 --> 00:33:44,090
Police will be here any minute.
We're fucked.

427
00:33:44,124 --> 00:33:46,589
When the feds find the bodies
and the van, we are fucked.

428
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:50,416
No. If it's happening all over, the police
are gonna be too busy tonight.

429
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:53,041
National emergency,
army on the streets, helicopters,

430
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:54,801
all that 28 Days Later shit.

431
00:33:55,374 --> 00:33:57,590
We need to get off the streets.
Back in the block.

432
00:33:57,624 --> 00:33:59,212
Like none of this ever happened.

433
00:33:59,249 --> 00:34:01,050
Yes, boss. Back in the block!

434
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,086
How do we do that
with them things out there?

435
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,794
That's suicide, man.

436
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:11,009
You know what?
What?

437
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:13,506
I'm shitting myself, innit.
But at the same time...

438
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:15,297
What?

439
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,003
This is sick.

440
00:34:53,249 --> 00:34:54,919
Fuck!

441
00:34:56,499 --> 00:34:58,667
They're on us!

442
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:01,504
Split! Meet at the block!
Oi, pedal, pedal, pedal!

443
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:02,797
Jerome, pedal!

444
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:01,424
Stairs, blood!

445
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:03,425
Move, move, move, move!

446
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:05,259
Where's Biggz?
Where's Pest?

447
00:37:06,874 --> 00:37:09,291
Hurry up!

448
00:37:11,499 --> 00:37:13,217
Go on, run!

449
00:37:13,249 --> 00:37:14,884
Close the door, man!

450
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:18,343
Fuck!

451
00:37:18,374 --> 00:37:19,630
Grab it!

452
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:27,419
Aarghh!

453
00:37:55,624 --> 00:37:58,302
Hey, snitch!

454
00:38:00,499 --> 00:38:02,217
Move, man! Huh? Move!

455
00:38:02,249 --> 00:38:03,635
Fucking move!

456
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:08,875
Hey, come on, blood!
Get the bag off him!

457
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:15,176
Somebody bell Biggz. Where's Biggz?
I got one text left.

458
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:17,460
I got no credit.
Drop call everybody.

459
00:38:17,499 --> 00:38:21,338
Pray someone calls back.
This is too much to explain in one text.

460
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:35,002
Get out of my fucking flat!

461
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:38,668
Shut up, man.
Pss...

462
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:41,588
I said, get out!
Yo, snitch, calm yourself.

463
00:38:41,624 --> 00:38:43,176
This ain't about you no more.

464
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:46,798
Come anywhere near me and I swear
I will scream this fucking block down!

465
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:49,334
There's worse things out there
than us tonight.

466
00:38:49,374 --> 00:38:51,791
Hey, bruv. I saw her ID card thingy.

467
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:54,795
She's a nurse, innit.
Help me, then. I need this leg.

468
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,085
I need it to be able to run away
from them things.

469
00:38:57,124 --> 00:38:58,878
You think I'm gonna help you?

470
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:02,506
After you attacked me, and robbed me,
and then set those dogs on the police?

471
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:05,219
Yes to the first two, no to the last one.
Dogs?

472
00:39:05,249 --> 00:39:07,880
Dogs with glow-in-the-dark jaws?
Dogs with no eyes?

473
00:39:07,916 --> 00:39:10,463
Dogs the size of gorillas?
D'you think they're dogs?

474
00:39:10,499 --> 00:39:13,877
Go out there and try feedin' 'em
some Pedigree Chum. They're aliens.

475
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:17,340
Whatever the fuck they are,
they're not fucking aliens.

476
00:39:17,374 --> 00:39:20,716
You swear too much, man.
Yeah, you got a potty mouth, man.

477
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:23,089
Whatever they are,
they're inside the block.

478
00:39:23,124 --> 00:39:24,842
They're after everyone.

479
00:39:24,874 --> 00:39:28,050
Yeah, we're on the same side now.
You get me?

480
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:36,258
No feds.
You'd be better off calling the Ghostbusters.

481
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:39,467
This is the block. We take care of things
our own way. Get me?

482
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:41,797
You're joking?
Does it look like he's jokin'?

483
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:45,590
I was gonna call for help.
Your friend needs to go to hospital.

484
00:39:45,624 --> 00:39:48,634
So do you. If those wounds get infected,
they could kill you.

485
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:51,676
Nah, he likes his scars, innit.
Fuck!

486
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,426
He's bleedin' to death! Help him!

487
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:55,342
We ain't gonna do nothing.

488
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:57,711
Fix him.

489
00:40:00,249 --> 00:40:01,540
Jesus.

490
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:18,713
<i>It's one of me most extraodinary
spectacles in nature.</i>

491
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,710
What if those kids were right?

492
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:24,006
What if they're connected -
that freak show animal

493
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:25,427
and the hole in my dad's car?

494
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:29,048
What if there is some kind of invasion
and the police are out there?

495
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:32,006
I can't get busted again.

496
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:34,257
You've been busted?
Yeah.

497
00:40:35,374 --> 00:40:39,676
Left half an oz in my jeans, put them in
the washing machine by mistake and...

498
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:43,666
I shit you not, my mum's underwear
came out stinking of skunk.

499
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:48,342
My dad obviously caught a whiff
and cut off my allowance.

500
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:51,544
Next time, it'll be my testiklees.

501
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,881
Yeah, it's tough times for you, mate.

502
00:40:54,749 --> 00:40:58,043
The irony is, now I've gotta sell
twice the amount just to pay the rent.

503
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:00,878
I thought you said you lived at home?

504
00:41:02,249 --> 00:41:05,508
Yeah, well, I mean...
I mean "rent" in the proverbial sense.

505
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:08,800
Oh, yeah. Well, you gotta do
what you gotta do, you know.

506
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:12,839
A man's gotta put bread on the table -
proverbially speaking, of course.

507
00:41:12,874 --> 00:41:14,462
Fo-shizzle.

508
00:41:14,499 --> 00:41:17,130
Listen, even if it is an alien invasion,

509
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,293
they're four foot high, they're blind

510
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:22,213
and they got kicked to death
by a group of kids.

511
00:41:22,249 --> 00:41:25,129
We got nothing to worry about.
Yeah.

512
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:26,713
All right?
Yeah.

513
00:41:40,124 --> 00:41:42,209
Sorry I messed up your couch.

514
00:41:42,874 --> 00:41:45,588
Don't worry about it.
D'you want me to take 'em off?

515
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:47,885
That won't be necessary.

516
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:50,084
You sure? I got nice boxers on.

517
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:52,545
Genuine Calvin Klein. Fresh today.

518
00:41:54,374 --> 00:41:56,791
Tell me if this hurts.
Try me.

519
00:41:57,624 --> 00:41:58,833
Ow! Hurts.

520
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:02,635
How about this?
Hurts, hurts, hurts, hurts, hurts!

521
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:05,249
You've torn a few minor arteries.
You might have a fracture.

522
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:07,673
This needs treating
before you lose too much blood.

523
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:09,592
Do it, then.
I can't do it.

524
00:42:09,624 --> 00:42:12,089
I don't have the equipment or the skill.

525
00:42:12,124 --> 00:42:13,629
I've only just graduated.

526
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:16,000
And I missed the class
on alien bite wounds.

527
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:17,546
Stop hyping, man.

528
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:19,632
Pass me that cushion.

529
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:23,634
I said, pass me that cushion!

530
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,883
Oh! Don't take it out on me.

531
00:42:36,499 --> 00:42:38,715
I ain't seen you around here before,
you know.

532
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:42,002
You lived here long?
Couple of months.

533
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:44,209
Hmm. Nice place you got.

534
00:42:44,249 --> 00:42:47,093
Thanks. Thinking of moving.

535
00:42:47,124 --> 00:42:49,173
Shame. Why?

536
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:52,419
I don't like the area.
What do you mean, don't like the area?

537
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:53,927
What's wrong with the area?

538
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:58,051
Fam, stay.

539
00:43:22,874 --> 00:43:24,711
Get off me!

540
00:43:26,249 --> 00:43:28,050
What was that?
They found us.

541
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:31,425
How could they find us?
There's, like, 160 doors in this block.

542
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:34,669
Whatever gang war you're involved in,
leave me out of it, please.

543
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:38,674
Hey, this ain't got nothin'
to do with gangs.

544
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:42,002
Or drugs. Or rap music.
Or violence in video games.

545
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:45,217
This is the worst night of my life.
Feeling's mutual.

546
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:52,213
Moses, don't, man!

547
00:44:05,124 --> 00:44:06,676
Moses.

548
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:08,296
Ninja!

549
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:10,051
Tango neutralised.

550
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:25,049
See? Is that a dog?

551
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:28,338
No.
No, that is not a dog.

552
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,009
That's black.

553
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:32,546
Too black to see.

554
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:35,628
That's the blackest black ever, fam.

555
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:43,010
That's blacker than my cousin Femi.

556
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:46,376
Oi, where's that woman?

557
00:45:14,874 --> 00:45:17,801
Wherever you're going,
I'm coming with you.

558
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:20,795
After what you put me through tonight,
it's the least you can do.

559
00:45:20,833 --> 00:45:23,464
No way, man.
She's bare annoyin'.

560
00:45:23,499 --> 00:45:26,343
Make her leave.
Let that snitch get murked.

561
00:45:26,374 --> 00:45:28,507
Dennis, why you acting like such a prick?

562
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:30,590
I need the nurse.
Do you want me to die?

563
00:45:30,624 --> 00:45:33,586
We can't stand around here arguing.
We need to roll. Now!

564
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:36,045
My name's Sam.
Jerome.

565
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:37,837
I'm Pest.
No, man.

566
00:45:37,874 --> 00:45:38,916
Dennis.

567
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:41,213
You're Moses, right?

568
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:45,462
You're gonna need a weapon.

569
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:12,251
Move along, please. Move along.

570
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:22,587
Yo, bring it, bring it, bring it.

571
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:26,011
Bring it, bring it, bring it.
Yo, bring the thing, blood.

572
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:29,542
What's happening, man?
Something fucked up.

573
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:33,007
Hi-Hatz, bruv, there's bare feds in the area,
roadblocks and everything.

574
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:35,293
Maybe we should chill out
till things die down.

575
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:38,343
Are you telling me to chill out?
No. Wait till things cool down.

576
00:46:38,374 --> 00:46:40,839
You telling me to cool down?
Ah, forget it, bruv.

577
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:43,626
Get in the car.

578
00:46:45,999 --> 00:46:48,630
Get in the car now!

579
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:53,339
They mash up my whip
with a bully van they stole,

580
00:46:53,374 --> 00:46:55,708
start threatening me about aliens
or some shit,

581
00:46:55,791 --> 00:46:58,801
facing me down,
telling me I'm gonna get shifted.

582
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:01,215
Hey, watch where you're going,
you prick!

583
00:47:01,249 --> 00:47:05,800
Then, some like...some like big dog,
some big gorilla wolf motherfucker,

584
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:10,300
comes down from the roof, rolls Tonks,
tears his neck all the way out. Believe.

585
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:14,511
So was it a dog, then?
Don't give a fuck what it was.

586
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:16,508
Shot that ting. Died easy.

587
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:19,791
And we gotta learn them youngers
tonight, you get me?

588
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:21,670
That's my block!

589
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:23,545
~Don't give a fuck

590
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:24,673
~Blat, blat, blat

591
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:27,255
~Get that snitch
Get the strap

592
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:29,708
~Don't give a fuck
Blat, blat, blat...

593
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:58,463
You get four years for carrying
an offensive weapon, you know.

594
00:47:58,499 --> 00:48:01,628
I think this situation's a bit different.
Is it?

595
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:05,008
Walking around,
expecting to get jumped at any moment?

596
00:48:05,041 --> 00:48:07,090
Feels like just another day in the ends to me.

597
00:48:07,124 --> 00:48:09,838
Where's he taking us?
Tia's flat.

598
00:48:09,874 --> 00:48:13,631
How will we be any safer in her place?
Security gate.

599
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:17,719
She wouldn't be asking that question
if she'd seen them girls fight.

600
00:48:22,999 --> 00:48:24,717
Ay, it's Biggz. He's alive.

601
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:30,050
<i>Yo, Biggz, we thought you was dead.
I called you 50 times, blood.</i>

602
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:33,259
What's your phone doing on silent
at a time like this for, fam?

603
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:34,677
<i>Where you at?
In the bin.</i>

604
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:37,837
Same bin I was at that time
them boys from Aylesbury was after me.

605
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:42,176
One of them things is trying to headbang
me out. Rescue me, yeah?

606
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:45,917
Ain't that simple, bruv. Them things
are in the block, busting through doors.

607
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:49,092
You're the only one with credit.
Call everyone, spread the word.

608
00:48:49,124 --> 00:48:50,712
Tell them to stay inside. Get me?

609
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:52,876
<i>I'll bell you back when we get to Tia's.</i>

610
00:48:53,708 --> 00:48:55,213
Fuck this, man!

611
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:01,677
<i>Yo, Biggz.
Listen, listen.</i>

612
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:05,298
<i>I've got one pound credit and bare people
to call. I can only say this once.</i>

613
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,003
<i>We need backup. Alien attack.</i>

614
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:10,584
Slow down. I don't understand
a word you're saying. Speak slowly.

615
00:49:10,624 --> 00:49:12,840
<i>This ain't no time to be speaking slowly!</i>

616
00:49:12,874 --> 00:49:15,919
<i>Moses and Dennis are heading to Tia's.
Call everyone!</i>

617
00:49:15,999 --> 00:49:18,926
<i>Tell them to come back!
That thing we killed was for real!</i>

618
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:21,084
<i>Now there's bigger ones battering me...</i>

619
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,885
Phone me later
when you ain't playing Xbox.

620
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:34,590
Check it. Reginald and Gavin survived.

621
00:49:34,624 --> 00:49:38,048
Don't answer those names no more.
It's Probs and Mayhem.

622
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:39,801
Fam, we saw the aliens.

623
00:49:39,833 --> 00:49:41,882
They ran past us, straight.

624
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:43,670
We got tools.

625
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:48,718
Let us roll with you, man.
That's not real, is it?

626
00:49:48,791 --> 00:49:51,635
Jesus, he looks about six
I'm nine and a half.

627
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:55,209
That ain't a toy, Gavin. Give me that.
Hey, leave it!

628
00:49:57,874 --> 00:49:59,841
Hey. Hey, let go, fam. Oi, let go.

629
00:49:59,874 --> 00:50:02,291
Yo, Reginald, Gavin!

630
00:50:03,249 --> 00:50:06,259
Go home, lock your door.
Do your homework. Watch Naruto.

631
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:08,210
Just stay inside tonight, get me?

632
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,794
That's my cousin's!
I gotta give it back!

633
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:14,215
Stop bitching,
You got a Super Soaker still.

634
00:50:14,249 --> 00:50:16,796
You really think they'll die
if you shoot water at them?

635
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:19,629
Ain't water in it. Is it?

636
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:25,464
You ain't bringing all them in here. No.
They're involved in something.

637
00:50:25,499 --> 00:50:28,082
Someone's chasing 'em.
They got weapons.

638
00:50:28,124 --> 00:50:29,961
And, look, that one's bleedin'.

639
00:50:30,041 --> 00:50:32,008
And that woman, I don't even know her.

640
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:35,419
I'm not getting myself involved in
a situation I don't need to be in.

641
00:50:36,124 --> 00:50:38,008
It's my house, Dimples.

642
00:50:38,041 --> 00:50:39,213
Come.

643
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:42,709
Get off me, man.

644
00:50:50,666 --> 00:50:54,458
There's only one helicopter out there.
Copper chopper.

645
00:50:54,499 --> 00:50:57,841
Ain't even military.
And it's only around these ends.

646
00:50:57,874 --> 00:51:00,505
This ain't London-wide.
This is localised.

647
00:51:00,541 --> 00:51:04,001
Yeah, localised in your head.
Localised in your dreams.

648
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:06,044
Drapsed by the feds? Yes.

649
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:09,377
Big gorilla-alien-wolf monsters
killing everyone? Uh-uh.

650
00:51:09,416 --> 00:51:11,668
Maybe they only fell on these ends.
Please!

651
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:15,050
What kind of alien, out of all the places
in the whole wide world,

652
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:17,844
would invade some shitty council estate
in South London?

653
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:22,045
One that's looking for a fight.
They're coming for us. Ready or not.

654
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:25,838
~Ready or not, here I come

655
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,375
~You can't hide
Excuse me.

656
00:51:28,416 --> 00:51:29,885
~They're gonna find you

657
00:51:29,916 --> 00:51:31,753
Listen to me!

658
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:33,966
There's a dead one
in my living room.

659
00:51:34,041 --> 00:51:37,134
I live on the first floor.
Go and look if you don't believe me.

660
00:51:37,166 --> 00:51:40,128
You can walk right in.
There's no front door any more.

661
00:51:40,166 --> 00:51:43,259
Moses, when did you start going out
with your maths teacher?

662
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:47,964
How d'you know that woman?
We met earlier.

663
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:49,510
He mugged me.

664
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:52,670
Whey! For real?
That part I believe.

665
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:55,173
That true? You rob that woman?

666
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:58,917
Yeah. But afterwards she fixed my leg
and we saved her from the monster.

667
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:01,091
So...we're mates now and it's all sweet.

668
00:52:01,749 --> 00:52:04,047
We're heroes, innit?
Heroes?

669
00:52:04,749 --> 00:52:07,842
Five of you and a knife
against one woman? Fuck off!

670
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,426
Raah. Cold.

671
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:12,302
Nah, nah, nah, don't build it up, luv.
It weren't all that.

672
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:15,509
We never even touched you.
The blade was to get it over with quick.

673
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:17,544
We was as scared as you.
Blade?

674
00:52:18,416 --> 00:52:21,876
You're such a waste.
Why's it always trouble with you?

675
00:52:21,916 --> 00:52:25,294
Why's it always someone gettin' robbed
or beaten up or gettin' arrested?

676
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:28,177
We can't deal with this on our own.
We have to call the police.

677
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:32,003
You can trust me.
I'll tell them what really happened.

678
00:52:32,041 --> 00:52:33,676
Think the police will help them?

679
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:36,090
They might not arrest you,
but they'll arrest them.

680
00:52:36,124 --> 00:52:40,000
For the murder of two police officers,
vehicle theft, resisting arrest -

681
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:42,837
everything that happened
everywhere in the ends tonight.

682
00:52:42,874 --> 00:52:44,711
They arrest us for nothing already.

683
00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:48,632
You know what I reckon, yeah?

684
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:51,083
I reckon the feds sent them, anyway.

685
00:52:51,124 --> 00:52:54,051
Government probably bred
those creatures to kill black boys.

686
00:52:55,124 --> 00:52:58,502
First they sent drugs to the ends,
then they sent guns.

687
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:01,169
Now they sent monsters to get us.

688
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:03,211
They don't care, man.

689
00:53:03,249 --> 00:53:05,168
We ain't killin' each other fast enough,

690
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:07,175
so they decided
to speed up the process.

691
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:10,626
Believe.

692
00:53:12,624 --> 00:53:16,297
Pest, I told you not to do that!
Do it out the window, yeah?

693
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:18,134
It's pain relief. Ask the nurse.

694
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:24,215
Excuse me, but what is that?

695
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,049
Oh, my days!

696
00:53:37,624 --> 00:53:39,876
You can't take two, fam.
Watch me.

697
00:53:42,749 --> 00:53:45,250
Shit. It is a toy!

698
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:57,672
Help! Hey, Moses!

699
00:54:00,166 --> 00:54:01,256
Dennis!

700
00:54:18,499 --> 00:54:21,082
Moses.
It's coming for you, Moses!

701
00:54:27,624 --> 00:54:29,176
Oi, you fucker!

702
00:54:30,416 --> 00:54:32,465
Tia, what you doing?

703
00:54:34,166 --> 00:54:35,208
Back!

704
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:39,921
Bash it! Kill it! Kill it!

705
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,544
Don't stop!
Harder! Cut him!

706
00:55:02,291 --> 00:55:04,294
Kill him! Harder!

707
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:12,378
Oh, shit!

708
00:55:24,124 --> 00:55:27,418
Yo, youngers, wagwan?

709
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:28,927
Nothing much.
All right.

710
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,043
Nice weapons. Who you fightin'?

711
00:55:31,083 --> 00:55:33,216
Aliens.
Is it?

712
00:55:33,249 --> 00:55:35,547
Seen that yout Moses lately?
Who wants to know?

713
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:40,333
He called us for backup.
Help him fight the aliens off.

714
00:55:40,374 --> 00:55:41,713
Bang! Bang! Bang!

715
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:45,503
So, where's he at?

716
00:55:57,874 --> 00:56:00,421
You know that little one
you killed before?

717
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:02,046
That was a mistake.

718
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:04,844
They weren't going for us.
They were going for you.

719
00:56:04,874 --> 00:56:07,291
Actions have consequences, you know.

720
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:09,501
Everywhere you go, bad things happen.

721
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,548
Stay away from us, Moses.

722
00:56:30,041 --> 00:56:33,086
You should leave.
I don't want no one else to die.

723
00:56:33,124 --> 00:56:36,466
Fuck that, bruv. I got your back.
I ain't going nowhere.

724
00:56:36,499 --> 00:56:40,042
They took Dennis.
We gotta kill all them things, bruv.

725
00:56:43,874 --> 00:56:45,260
Come on!

726
00:56:48,749 --> 00:56:50,550
Come on!

727
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:58,878
Easy kill.

728
00:57:03,499 --> 00:57:05,502
Run, man! Come on!

729
00:57:05,541 --> 00:57:08,503
What are you waiting for?
Shit!

730
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:10,295
Open the door! Go!

731
00:57:22,291 --> 00:57:25,420
<i>Wagwan, it's young Den.
If it's girls, leave a message.</i>

732
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:27,212
<i>Mandem, I'm on the block, innit.</i>

733
00:57:27,249 --> 00:57:29,168
Dennis, fam, I made bare calls.

734
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:32,301
Everyone's come down to back us,
blood, but no one can get inside.

735
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:34,501
Feds have the block on lockdown.

736
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:37,337
<i>You've got one minute remaining.</i>

737
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:40,716
I ain't got much credit.
And I can't be in this bin much longer.

738
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:42,301
I need to make a break for it.

739
00:57:43,041 --> 00:57:45,090
I'll see you at the other side, yeah?

740
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:54,878
Aargh!

741
00:57:55,666 --> 00:57:57,550
Hey, what the fuck, man!

742
00:57:59,749 --> 00:58:02,047
Why won't someone flippin' rescue me?

743
00:59:02,624 --> 00:59:05,468
Better get the next one, blood.

744
00:59:35,874 --> 00:59:37,877
Go, man!

745
00:59:40,916 --> 00:59:43,333
Who was that?
That's Hi-Hatz.

746
00:59:43,374 --> 00:59:45,708
Man's a sausage.
Why is he shooting at us?

747
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,917
His best friend got ate
and he's a bit vexed.

748
00:59:49,874 --> 00:59:51,841
I know exactly how he feels.

749
00:59:51,874 --> 00:59:54,552
Would someone please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

750
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:58,251
What's chasing you? Why is
the other lift full of bits of dead people?

751
00:59:58,291 --> 00:59:59,843
What? We need to go down.

752
00:59:59,874 --> 01:00:03,666
I ain't going down. There's too many
things down there out to get me.

753
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:08,259
True say. Bare police, crazy gangsters
and fucked-up monsters down there.

754
01:00:08,291 --> 01:00:11,087
OK. Good. Let's not go down.
Where can we go?

755
01:00:11,124 --> 01:00:14,383
We're going to Ron's weed room.
What's Ron's weed room?

756
01:00:14,416 --> 01:00:17,260
It's a big room full of weed.
And it's Ron's. It's good.

757
01:00:17,291 --> 01:00:19,673
It's like Fort fucking Knox up there.
Plan.

758
01:00:19,708 --> 01:00:20,964
19.

759
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:26,129
Bravo Team, on me, on me. Hold positions.

760
01:00:28,874 --> 01:00:32,880
This is long, man. They've all gone.

761
01:00:36,041 --> 01:00:38,375
No, they ain't. Check it.

762
01:01:03,166 --> 01:01:05,713
Down the end.
Raah.

763
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,632
I am too high for this shit.

764
01:01:12,291 --> 01:01:13,712
Trust.

765
01:01:17,124 --> 01:01:19,885
I wanna shoot those things, man.
Same here, bruv.

766
01:01:19,916 --> 01:01:22,843
Times three.
Done now.

767
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:52,343
Bangers, man, bangers!
I'm Brewis, by the way.

768
01:01:52,374 --> 01:01:54,258
Sam.
Front pocket, man.

769
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:58,715
I'm meant to be at a party in Fulham.
Now I'm trapped in this bloody block.

770
01:01:58,749 --> 01:02:02,091
Yo, Pest. Get ready with that lighter.
Yeah, pass it, pass it.

771
01:02:02,124 --> 01:02:04,209
What about you?
I live here.

772
01:02:05,124 --> 01:02:06,629
Really?

773
01:02:06,666 --> 01:02:08,005
Wicked.

774
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:09,878
I'm set.

775
01:02:25,916 --> 01:02:28,214
Lights. Stay close.

776
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:31,339
Go. Go, go.

777
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:40,967
Hurry up, man. Keep moving.
Wait for me.

778
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:48,336
Fire in the hole.

779
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:01,341
Get the fuck off me, man.

780
01:03:03,041 --> 01:03:05,339
Jesus. There's one behind us. Run!

781
01:03:13,041 --> 01:03:15,968
Jerome, where are you, man?

782
01:03:22,541 --> 01:03:24,093
Jerome!

783
01:03:27,041 --> 01:03:29,837
Jerome! Where you at?

784
01:03:29,874 --> 01:03:31,544
Jerome!

785
01:03:31,624 --> 01:03:33,294
PEST:Jerome?

786
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:42,876
I can't see shit, man!
Come on, come on. Come on.

787
01:03:43,916 --> 01:03:45,919
Pest? Moses?

788
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:48,461
Pest! Moses!

789
01:03:49,499 --> 01:03:52,509
Aaarghh!
Jerome, where you at?

790
01:03:52,541 --> 01:03:55,551
Oi, lights, man, lights!
Trying to find 'em, man.

791
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,382
I'm going back. Stay by the lights.

792
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:03,874
Are you there, man?

793
01:04:04,666 --> 01:04:06,669
They're coming up the stairs, quick.

794
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:08,343
Jerome?

795
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:15,332
Help! Help!

796
01:04:20,416 --> 01:04:22,632
Aargh!
Follow me!

797
01:04:22,666 --> 01:04:25,344
They got Jerome. Moses!

798
01:04:25,374 --> 01:04:28,419
They took him!
They took Jerome!

799
01:04:30,874 --> 01:04:33,090
Man!
Oh!

800
01:04:35,374 --> 01:04:37,507
What the fuck was that for?

801
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:42,418
Moses, blood!
Come on, man, they'll kill you!

802
01:04:45,041 --> 01:04:46,629
Moses!

803
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:58,419
Yo, Ron! Ron!
Ron, man, let us in!

804
01:04:58,458 --> 01:04:59,879
Ron!
Open the door, man!

805
01:04:59,916 --> 01:05:02,333
Hey, let us in, man!
Hey, open the door!

806
01:05:02,374 --> 01:05:04,756
All right?
We need to hide in your weed room.

807
01:05:04,833 --> 01:05:07,085
It's the only safe place left in the block.

808
01:05:08,124 --> 01:05:10,127
I don't know about that.

809
01:05:10,874 --> 01:05:13,090
Ah, come on! Hurry up!
All right, all right.

810
01:05:13,124 --> 01:05:14,545
Come on.

811
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:18,923
Wagwan, Moses?

812
01:05:20,624 --> 01:05:21,915
Sorry.

813
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:32,051
You killed that thing.
Hi-Hatz, bruv...

814
01:05:32,083 --> 01:05:35,673
You brought it in the ends.
I don't want no trouble.

815
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:37,509
You brought fed in the ends.

816
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:39,674
Listen to me, bruv.

817
01:05:39,708 --> 01:05:44,045
You brought an alien invasion
to the ends.

818
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:46,167
Shit.

819
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:47,713
Behind you, bruv.

820
01:05:47,749 --> 01:05:49,668
Don't chat me.
I'm not even lyin'..

821
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:51,462
Shut up!

822
01:05:51,499 --> 01:05:53,169
I was gonna make you.

823
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:55,886
Now...I'm gonna dead you.

824
01:05:56,541 --> 01:05:58,709
This is my block. Get me?

825
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,135
Not really.

826
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,667
Wish I'd never chased after that thing.

827
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:50,424
Wish we never murked you.

828
01:06:52,249 --> 01:06:54,832
I wish I never took that white off Hi-Hatz.

829
01:06:55,499 --> 01:06:58,675
Wish I'd just gone home
and played FIFA like Biggz said.

830
01:06:59,874 --> 01:07:01,877
Anyone got skins?

831
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:05,169
No.

832
01:07:05,958 --> 01:07:09,134
Bare weed and no skins.

833
01:07:09,166 --> 01:07:11,251
This is my worst nightmare.

834
01:07:11,958 --> 01:07:15,382
Listen, yeah.
We never knew you lived in the block.

835
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:19,343
If... If we knew you,
we wouldn't have stepped you.

836
01:07:19,374 --> 01:07:23,332
It would have been OK to mug me
if I didn't live here? Is that how it works?

837
01:07:23,374 --> 01:07:25,044
Boy, you's tetchy.

838
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:27,299
He's tryin' to apologise to you, man.

839
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:32,841
You're quite fit, you know.

840
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:36,966
Have you got a boyfriend?
Yeah.

841
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:40,255
Are you sure about him?
Where is he?

842
01:07:40,291 --> 01:07:42,756
Cos he ain't exactly
looking after you tonight.

843
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:45,713
He's in Ghana.
You go out with an African man?

844
01:07:45,749 --> 01:07:49,209
No, he's helping children.
He volunteers for the Red Cross.

845
01:07:49,249 --> 01:07:51,216
Oh, is it?

846
01:07:51,874 --> 01:07:54,375
Why can't he help
the children of Britain?

847
01:07:54,416 --> 01:07:56,419
Not exotic enough, is it?

848
01:07:56,458 --> 01:07:58,461
Don't get no nice suntan.

849
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:14,882
Raah. Moses, your jacket's gone rave.

850
01:08:17,041 --> 01:08:18,510
It's glowing in the UV light.

851
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:24,918
Maybe it's some kind of pheromone.

852
01:08:25,624 --> 01:08:27,342
Maybe it's a what now?

853
01:08:27,374 --> 01:08:30,088
Er...it's an eco-hormone
that triggers a social response

854
01:08:30,124 --> 01:08:32,043
in members of the same species.

855
01:08:32,749 --> 01:08:35,925
Maybe that's a female
and the others are male,

856
01:08:35,958 --> 01:08:39,336
and that... that... that stuff
is what's attracting them here.

857
01:08:39,374 --> 01:08:41,341
They're smelling us.

858
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:45,042
They fell out of the sky, yeah?

859
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:50,511
Well, maybe they like drift through space
on... on solar winds, like spores,

860
01:08:50,541 --> 01:08:53,172
and...whatever planet they land on first,

861
01:08:53,208 --> 01:08:56,088
the female leaves a pheromone trail
for the males to follow it,

862
01:08:56,124 --> 01:08:58,340
find it, breed, et cetera.

863
01:08:59,499 --> 01:09:01,667
Like bees, like beetles, like moths.

864
01:09:01,708 --> 01:09:04,090
Some fucking funny-looking moth.

865
01:09:05,124 --> 01:09:06,214
Yeah.

866
01:09:06,249 --> 01:09:08,666
Well, whatever it is, you're covered in it

867
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:12,761
and it seems to be piquing the interest
of a rather hostile alien species.

868
01:09:12,791 --> 01:09:15,836
I'm just just saying,
maybe if you took those clothes off,

869
01:09:15,874 --> 01:09:17,675
they wouldn't know we were here.

870
01:09:17,708 --> 01:09:20,504
You fancy him or something?
Are you trying to get him naked?

871
01:09:20,541 --> 01:09:22,875
No, I'm trying to save your life.

872
01:09:24,374 --> 01:09:27,384
And in answer to your question earlier...

873
01:09:30,874 --> 01:09:33,042
Ah, thank fuck.

874
01:09:34,249 --> 01:09:37,958
Bruv, I swear I will never cuss you again.

875
01:09:43,749 --> 01:09:46,083
Yo, Brewis.

876
01:09:46,124 --> 01:09:49,051
Everyone who touched this thing
got murked, you know -

877
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:51,378
Dennis...

878
01:09:51,416 --> 01:09:52,837
Jerome...

879
01:09:52,874 --> 01:09:54,343
Tonks...

880
01:09:54,374 --> 01:09:56,459
them feds when they tried touch me,

881
01:09:57,208 --> 01:09:59,424
everyone who had that scent on them.

882
01:10:00,249 --> 01:10:02,631
So if they follow the smell on that, then...

883
01:10:04,249 --> 01:10:06,547
..maybe I can lead 'em.

884
01:10:06,624 --> 01:10:10,333
Lead them where?
Somewhere I can blow them up.

885
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:14,715
I killed that thing.
I brought them in the block.

886
01:10:16,499 --> 01:10:18,502
I've gotta finish what I started.

887
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:31,337
What if it jumps at us?
Then throw the banger.

888
01:10:31,374 --> 01:10:33,708
What if I miss?
Then we run.

889
01:10:33,749 --> 01:10:35,965
What if it kills us?

890
01:10:36,041 --> 01:10:41,718
No one is gonna ever call you Mayhem
if you keep on acting like such a pussy.

891
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:53,378
I'm tellin' the truth! I know I lied to you before,
but it's for real this time, I swear!

892
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:56,710
<i>..I'm calling your dad. You hear me?</i>

893
01:10:56,749 --> 01:10:58,337
Throw it, throw it, throw it!

894
01:10:59,291 --> 01:11:00,500
Now, now, do it!

895
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:03,219
<i>Are you even listening?
Mum, I gotta go.</i>

896
01:11:03,249 --> 01:11:05,086
Just do as I say and stay indoors.

897
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:09,252
I won't ever do anything bad again,
I promise.

898
01:11:09,291 --> 01:11:12,834
<i>I love you, Mum. I love you.
Five minutes!</i>

899
01:11:31,749 --> 01:11:35,339
Any time, blood. Any time.
We don't give a fuck, man.

900
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,211
Armed police. Stay where you are!

901
01:11:37,249 --> 01:11:38,718
Fuck.

902
01:11:45,041 --> 01:11:47,339
Wagwan, Biggz.
What are you doing?

903
01:11:47,374 --> 01:11:50,005
Armed police, fam.
Swear down?

904
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:52,423
Swear down.

905
01:11:52,458 --> 01:11:54,626
You burnt that thing good. Ratings.

906
01:11:54,666 --> 01:11:57,676
Easy peasy.
Lemon squeezy.

907
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:01,384
Probs and Mayhem, right?

908
01:12:02,499 --> 01:12:04,502
Yeah.

909
01:12:21,749 --> 01:12:23,254
You look clean.

910
01:12:24,458 --> 01:12:25,714
You look good.

911
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:29,126
I'm betting my life we're right about this.

912
01:12:30,041 --> 01:12:33,880
Believe me, I'd go out there myself
if I wasn't so profoundly stoned.

913
01:12:34,166 --> 01:12:36,169
Likewise.

914
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:46,834
One floor down. 191.
One floor down. 191.

915
01:12:46,874 --> 01:12:49,090
You bell me when you get there.
Yeah.

916
01:12:50,041 --> 01:12:52,375
Yo, Pest, give me that ring.

917
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:55,219
What ring, man?

918
01:12:56,499 --> 01:12:59,046
Oh, man, that's ours.

919
01:12:59,624 --> 01:13:01,922
It's worth bare P, man.
Give it!

920
01:13:04,416 --> 01:13:06,086
Raasclaat, man.

921
01:13:13,166 --> 01:13:14,635
Thanks.

922
01:13:17,708 --> 01:13:20,753
Even if you outrun them,
even if you make it,

923
01:13:20,791 --> 01:13:22,212
how are you gonna get out?

924
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:26,090
Don't worry about me, man.

925
01:13:27,458 --> 01:13:29,425
You don't have to do this, Moses.

926
01:13:30,916 --> 01:13:32,835
Yeah, I do.

927
01:13:58,708 --> 01:14:00,462
Oi. Hi.

928
01:14:00,499 --> 01:14:02,169
Is it safe?

929
01:14:04,749 --> 01:14:07,676
No. All right. Good luck.

930
01:15:08,249 --> 01:15:10,880
<i>Are you sure no one's here?
Yeah.</i>

931
01:15:18,208 --> 01:15:19,677
Who do you live with?

932
01:15:20,833 --> 01:15:22,254
Just my uncle.

933
01:15:26,624 --> 01:15:28,129
Where's he?

934
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:31,630
Comes and goes.

935
01:15:31,666 --> 01:15:33,503
Goes, mostly.

936
01:15:42,749 --> 01:15:44,337
You got a little brother?

937
01:15:44,374 --> 01:15:45,546
No.

938
01:15:46,749 --> 01:15:49,545
<i>How old are you?
15.</i>

939
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:53,129
You look older.

940
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:55,042
Thanks.

941
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:03,379
Shut the hatch.

942
01:16:03,416 --> 01:16:05,253
<i>Lock the window.</i>

943
01:16:05,291 --> 01:16:07,459
<i>Leave the front door on the latch.</i>

944
01:16:07,499 --> 01:16:10,082
<i>Turn all the gas all the way up.</i>

945
01:16:14,416 --> 01:16:17,509
<i>Get out the block as fast as you can.
You hear me?</i>

946
01:16:20,874 --> 01:16:22,295
Good luck, Moses.

947
01:16:23,041 --> 01:16:24,510
Later.

948
01:16:24,541 --> 01:16:26,626
Moses versus the monsters.

949
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:29,546
Kill 'em. Kill all them things.

950
01:16:30,541 --> 01:16:32,378
Allow it.

951
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:33,378
Is that Moses?
Moses!

952
01:18:33,416 --> 01:18:34,423
Moses.

953
01:19:29,166 --> 01:19:31,844
Oh, shit.
Is that more of the monsters?

954
01:19:31,874 --> 01:19:33,165
Sort of.

955
01:19:34,874 --> 01:19:37,042
Armed police! Put your weapons down!

956
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:38,967
Down on the ground!
Down on the ground!

957
01:19:45,833 --> 01:19:49,127
Armed police! Drop your weapon!
Hands on head!

958
01:19:53,874 --> 01:19:55,877
Drop your weapon now!

959
01:20:07,708 --> 01:20:09,675
Get off me!
This one?

960
01:20:09,708 --> 01:20:11,545
Aaargh, get off.

961
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,674
Get off me. Aaargh.

962
01:20:14,708 --> 01:20:16,462
Stop resisting. Stop resisting.

963
01:20:16,499 --> 01:20:20,717
I ain't resisting. You're pushin' me over.
I don't even live here.

964
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:23,545
I am registered disabled.
You're hurting me.

965
01:20:23,583 --> 01:20:25,881
What's your number?
What's your number, huh?

966
01:20:25,916 --> 01:20:29,294
I know my civil liberties.
I'm a member of fucking Amnesty.

967
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:30,542
Get off me!

968
01:20:40,249 --> 01:20:44,467
Our Moses saved the planet!
He saved the planet from alien invasion.

969
01:20:44,499 --> 01:20:46,584
He's a hero. He's a legend.

970
01:20:46,624 --> 01:20:49,669
Moses. Call me, yeah?
We'll get you help.

971
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:51,841
Call me.
Yo, Moses.

972
01:20:51,874 --> 01:20:53,877
Hey, Moses. Moses.

973
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:57,502
Why do you always arrest the wrong people?

974
01:20:57,541 --> 01:21:00,835
Moses is a hero, don't you get it?
He saved the block.

975
01:21:00,874 --> 01:21:02,544
Excuse me, sir.

976
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:05,420
This is Samantha Adams,
the woman that called in the mugging.

977
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:09,334
Miss Adams, I believe you were out
with two of my officers earlier tonight?

978
01:21:09,916 --> 01:21:12,878
You know they lost their lives?
Yeah. I was there.

979
01:21:12,916 --> 01:21:14,634
We were attacked.

980
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:16,834
Those boys there,
the ones you're arresting...

981
01:21:16,874 --> 01:21:18,841
Can you confirm it was them?

982
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,628
Don't let them intimidate you, miss.

983
01:21:23,458 --> 01:21:26,172
No. I know them. They're my neighbours.

984
01:21:26,874 --> 01:21:28,544
They protected me.

985
01:21:28,624 --> 01:21:31,041
Yo, Moses. Hey, Moses.

986
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:34,543
Moses! Moses! Moses!

987
01:21:34,624 --> 01:21:37,420
Moses! Moses! Moses!

988
01:21:41,249 --> 01:21:43,003
Get off!

989
01:21:43,041 --> 01:21:46,383
Moses! Moses! Moses!

990
01:21:49,374 --> 01:21:50,630
Brap! Brap!

991
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:53,083
Brap! Brap! Brap!

992
01:21:53,124 --> 01:21:55,376
Brap! Brap! Brap!

993
01:21:55,416 --> 01:21:57,419
Moses, bruv.

994
01:21:58,374 --> 01:22:00,377
Can you hear that?

995
01:22:01,624 --> 01:22:05,842
Moses! Moses! Moses! Moses!

996
01:22:06,499 --> 01:22:08,217
That's for you, man.

997
01:22:13,624 --> 01:22:15,010
Youths So Cold

998
01:22:15,041 --> 01:22:17,090

~And the youths them a-get so cold

1000
01:22:20,583 --> 01:22:23,000

~As generation comes and goes

1007
01:22:41,208 --> 01:22:44,301
~You gotta make preparation
while the youths them grow

1008
01:22:44,791 --> 01:22:46,758
~It's what you reap, it's what you sow

1009
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:48,840
~The youth, them are the light and the future

~So that's when you know

1011
01:22:51,041 --> 01:22:52,842
~If education is the key

1012
01:22:52,874 --> 01:22:56,464
~Then tell me why the big guns
they make it so expensive for we

1013
01:22:56,874 --> 01:22:59,042
~Give them the key
Oh, set them free

1014
01:22:59,083 --> 01:23:01,381
~Ah-eeeeee!
