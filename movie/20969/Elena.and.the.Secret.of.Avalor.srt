小公主苏菲亚第三季第27集
艾莲娜与阿芒洛王国的秘密

3
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:34,633
好了娜奥米，我们到了！
Well， Naomi, here we are.

4
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:37,236
整个城市里我最喜欢的地方！
My favorite view of the city.

5
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:39,171
确实很棒，艾莲娜！
You were right, Elena.

6
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:41,073
值得跑一趟，
It was worth the hike,

7
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:42,474
虽然路不好走……
even if there was no path.

8
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:44,243
嗯哼，我以前经常一个人来这里，
Well, there used to be one.

9
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:47,813
但我已经有41年没来过了。
But I haven't been up here in 41 years.

10
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:49,515
哦，对了！
Oh, right.

11
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,850
你被困在那个护身符里了。
You were stuck in that amulet.

12
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,920
是啊，那就是为什么我要来这里。
Yes. That's kind of why I wanted to come up here.

13
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:57,222
我得给你看样东西！
There's something I need to show you.

14
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:09,034
那是什么？
What is that?

15
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:11,837
这是史瑞奇的魔法棒，
This wand belonged to Shuriki,

16
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:13,272
就是她入侵了阿瓦洛，
the sorceress who invaded Avalor.

17
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:16,375
那谁把你从护身符里救出来的呢？
The one who put you in that amulet?

18
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:18,110
差不多
Sort of.

19
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:19,945
是时候告诉你这些事了，
It's time I told you the whole story--

20
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,448
关于我是怎样失去一切的，包括我的父母。
how I lost everything and everyone I loved,

21
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,850
以及我是如何夺回一切的……
and how I finally found my way back home.

22
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:28,720
事实是，如果不是有一位叫苏菲亚的小公主
The truth is, I would still be trapped in that amulet today

23
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:31,256
勇敢的帮助了我，我有可能仍然
if it wasn't for a brave young princess

24
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,192
被困在护身符里……
named Sofia.

25
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,706
妈妈，爸爸！
Mama, Papa!

26
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:53,512
<i>Vadisima!（咒语）</i>

27
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,490
<i>Vadisima!（咒语）</i>

28
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,393
苏菲亚，你怎么了？
You okay, Sof?

29
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,761
这真是奇怪？！
That was weird.

30
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:11,463
我好像做了一个梦，
It was like I just had a dream,

31
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,298
然后我又醒了。
but I was wide awake.

32
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,300
你是在做白日梦吧，我天天都在做。。
It's called daydreaming. I do it all the time.

33
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,669
好了孩子们，就像我说的，
Children, as I was saying,

34
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,939
祝你们暑假过得愉快。
I hope you all have a wonderful summer.

35
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,408
放学了！
Class is dismissed.

36
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,414
让你的管家给我的管家写信。
Have your steward write my steward.

37
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,450
哦，我已经迫不及待想要知道
Oh, I can't wait to find out

38
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:34,586
爸爸会带我们去哪里度假了。
where Daddy is taking us for our summer trip.

39
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,421
快跟上，苏菲亚。
Come along, Sofia.

40
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,090
好吧，我得先回家，
Yeah, we better get home.

41
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:40,492
最好再去一趟秘密图书馆。
And I better get to the secret library.

42
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,795
孩子们随时都会回来，美兰达，
The kids will be here any minute, Miranda.

43
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,764
我们得快点找个能带他们去度假的地方。
We have to figure out where we're taking them.

44
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,499
科林西亚怎么样？
What about Corinthia?

45
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,135
我想我们应该找个没有去过的地方，
I was hoping to go someplace we haven't been before.

46
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,371
顺便结交一个新的贸易伙伴。
The kingdom could use a new trading partner.

47
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,439
我们回来了！
We're home!

48
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,542
我们要去哪儿？爸爸？
So, where are we going, Daddy?

49
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,777
我们还没决定好呢，安柏。
We're still trying to figure that out, Amber.

50
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:10,022
我希望能变小一点。
I wish to be small.

51
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:44,256
<i>"失落的阿瓦洛公主"？</i>
<i>"The Lost Princess of Avalor"?</i>

52
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:46,325
就像这阿瓦洛的护身符？
Like the Amulet of Avalor?

53
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,267
这确实是阿瓦洛的护身符。
Exactly like the Amulet of Avalor.

54
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,268


55
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,170
你不用怕我，
Don't be so alarmed.

56
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:01,673
我知道我不是你见过的第一本会说话的书！
I know I am not the first talking book you've seen here.

57
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,942
通常情况下，它们只会讲故事，
Usually, they just tell the stories.

58
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,577
但不会和我聊天。
They don't talk to me.

59
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,947
好吧，这本书是出自一位伟大的巫师之手。
Well, this book was made by a powerful wizard.

60
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:09,915
谁？
Who?

61
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,850
我，阿拉卡扎。
Me. Alacazar.

62
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,418
阿瓦洛的皇家巫师！
The royal wizard of Avalor.

63
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,587
好吧，我以前是皇家巫师，
Well, I was a royal wizard,

64
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,457
那是在我变成把自己变成这本会说话的书之前。
before I turned myself into a talking book.

65
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,625
你为什么要这样做？
Why did you do that?

66
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:21,927
这说来话长，
It is a long story,

67
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,929
我会慢慢告诉你，
which I am about to tell you,

68
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,430
所以请你先坐下。
so get comfy.

69
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,267
哇哦！
Whoa!

70
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,269
在大海的另一端，
Across the great ocean,

71
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:33,538
有一个充满魔力的王国，叫做阿瓦洛，
in the enchanted kingdom of Avalor,

72
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,943
那里曾住着一位叫艾莲娜的年轻公主。
there once lived a young princess named Elena.

73
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:41,647
在她15岁生日的那天，她的妈妈露西娅女王，
On her 15th birthday, her mother, Queen Lucia,

74
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:44,449
送给她一条魔法护身符，
gave her a magical amulet,

75
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:48,487
这护身符是阿瓦洛王室的传家宝，
the Amulet of Avalor, a family heirloom,

76
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,822
一代又一代传下来的，
passed down from generation to generation,

77
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,824
女王希望这能保佑她平安。
that would protect her from harm.

78
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:56,662
但悲剧终将到来，史瑞奇女王，
But one fateful day, Queen Shuriki,

79
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:59,064
一个既邪恶又极度
an evil, power-hungry sorceress

80
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,733
渴望权力的女巫，入侵了阿瓦洛。
from the northern islands, invaded Avalor.

81
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:04,636
她攻击了国王和皇后，
She attacked the king and queen,

82
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,571
并占领了皇宫。
then set her sights upon the palace.

83
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:10,976
艾莲娜公主选择了勇敢的面对史瑞奇
Princess Elena bravely chose to face Shuriki on her own,

84
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,178
来挽救自己的家人。
so that her family would be spared.

85
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,914
我上课时候看到过这些幻像。
I saw this before in my daydream.

86
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,183
那是艾莲娜在召唤你，
That was Elena's way of calling you here,

87
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,752
所以我要告诉你整件事的来龙去脉。
so I could tell you the whole story.

88
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,689
那时，史瑞奇想要除掉艾莲娜，
Now, when Shuriki tried to strike her down,

89
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:28,160
而护身符将她拉了进去使她逃过一劫。
the amulet saved Elena by pulling her inside it.

90
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:34,166
这就是为什么她会被困在你的护身符里。
And that is how the princess wound up inside your amulet.

91
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:37,502
她被困在我的护身符里？
There's a princess inside my amulet?

92
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,604
她已经被困了41年了，
And she's been there for 41 years.

93
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,541
但重要的是，
But this is the most important part.

94
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:45,711
史瑞奇以为艾莲娜已经死了，
Shuriki thought she had gotten rid of Elena,

95
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:47,612
可她错了。
but she was wrong.

96
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:50,782
我很快就找到了唯一能将她
I soon discovered that the only way to get her

97
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,517
从护身符里救出来的办法，
out of the amulet

98
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,986
但这需要一位特别的公主
was to find a special princess

99
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,389
才能做到。
who could set her free.

100
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,324
我在全世界寻找了许多年，
I searched the globe for years

101
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,560
直到我老得走不动了，
until I grew too old to continue,

102
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,729
于是我用我仅存的魔法
and used the last of my magic

103
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:06,865
把自己变成了这本书，
to transform myself into this book,

104
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:10,402
希望有一天，她的故事能有一个幸福结局。
so that someday, her story could have a happy ending.

105
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:13,171
到最后，艾莲娜似乎
And at last, it seems Elena

106
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,641
找到了我们一直苦苦寻找的那位公主。
finally found the princess we have been searching for.

107
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,478
你是说我吗？
She chose me?

108
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,879
你反应真快，
You catch on quickly.

109
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,647
我喜欢！
I like that.

110
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,050
现在，想要救出艾莲娜，
Now, in order to find Elena,

111
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,219
你得去我的家乡阿瓦洛，
you must travel to my home in Avalor,

112
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,987
还要召唤我的灵兽。
and summon my chanul.

113
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,689
等等，我该怎么做？
Wait. I have to do what?

114
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,592
去我在阿瓦洛的家，召唤出灵兽。
Go to my home in Avalor and summon my chanul.

115
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,861
但要小心，史瑞奇仍然
But be careful, for Queen Shuriki

116
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,863
统治着阿瓦洛，
still rules Avalor,

117
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:40,599
她法力强大而且邪恶至极，
and is as powerful and evil as ever.

118
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,601
所以你要尽量避开她。
So you probably want to keep your distance.

119
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,840
我能看出你还不是很确定，
I can see you are unsure.

120
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:52,677
听着，在你之前艾莲娜测试过许多位公主，
Listen, Elena tested many princesses before you.

121
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,780
她甚至还赋予她们力量，
She granted them powers and curses,

122
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:58,617
但她最终选择了你，
but you are the only one she chose,

123
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:00,952
并且自从你第一次戴上护身符时
and she has been preparing you for this day

124
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,555
她就已经准备好要从里面出来。
since you first put on the amulet.

125
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,857
所以如果你准备好了就不要放弃，
So you can do this if you choose to.

126
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,860
她的命运就掌握在你的手中，苏菲亚。
Her story is in your hands now, Sofia.

127
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:11,797
这就要看你如何选择了。
It is up to you how it ends.

128
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,816
我不在乎你扔在了哪里，詹姆士。
I don't care where the dart landed, James.

129
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:33,084
我们决不会去北极！
We are not going to the North Pole.

130
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,220
我知道我们应该去哪里，
I know where we should go.

131
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:37,289
我们应该去阿瓦洛！
We should go to Avalor.

132
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,891
- 什么？ - 阿瓦洛？
- What? - Avalor?

133
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,827
那里也太远了吧！
That's so far away.

134
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,296
我们得去一个比较近的地方度假。
And we need to visit a kingdom we can trade with.

135
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,064
我了解那里的所有事情，
I just read all about it,

136
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,433
阿瓦洛绝对是最理想的度假地点。
and Avalor is the perfect place for all of us.

137
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:51,670
你说你想去个没去过的地方
? You say you wanna go somewhere new ?

138
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:54,639
我就给你找了个合适的地方
? Well, I have just the new kingdom for you ?

139
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,642
一个值得我的去探索的地方
? A special place that we all can explore ?

140
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:01,847
所以让我来介绍一下阿瓦洛
? So let me tell you about Avalor ?

141
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,282
那里是个外交贸易大国
? It's where everyone goes to trade ?

142
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:07,752
我们可以在大商场购物
? We can shop in their grand arcade ?

143
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:10,489
那里有许多旅游景点
? It has plenty of sights to see ?

144
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:13,792
比如神秘的古代废墟
? And ancient ruins of mystery ?

145
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:17,362
那里景色优美气候宜人
? And beautiful scenery ?

146
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,865
所以让我离开皇宫
? So let's get out of our royal home ?

147
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:22,868
去探索未知的世界
? And all set out for the great unknown ?

148
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,605
我们会画出新的航海图
? We'll chart a course of our very own ?

149
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:33,778
来突破我们现有的认知
? And take a leap into the great unknown ?

150
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:39,718
完美的认知
? The great unknown ?

151
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,786
阿瓦洛听起来不错！
Avalor sounds great.

152
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,522
那能会很冒险。
What an adventure it could be.

153
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,056
但这对国家来说是好事，
And good for the kingdom.

154
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:46,892
只要去买点东西就行。
Just as long as we get to go shopping.

155
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:49,194
我们可以带上皇家舰队。
We'll take the royal galleon.

156
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:55,066
当我从海边起航
? Across the ocean as I set sail ?

157
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:58,003
我希望我不会失望
? I'm hoping that I won't fail ?

158
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:01,006
找到那位我从未谋面的公主
? To find a princess I've never met ?

159
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:04,042
而我最后要做的就是
? And end my biggest story yet ?

160
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,812
让她从护身符中重获自由
? And free her from my amulet ?

161
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,549
所以让我们离开皇宫
? So let's get out of our royal home ?

162
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,852
去探索未知的世界
? And all set out for the great unknown ?

163
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:17,255
也许我能买个新王座
? Maybe pick up a brand-new throne ?

164
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,824
让我们继续前行
? Let's take a leap ?

165
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:27,232
去那片我们未知的国度
? Into the great unknown ?

166
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:33,939
完美的国度
? The great unknown ?

167
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,782
现在看似一路顺风
? As the trade winds begin to blow ?

168
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:48,353
但事实却不尽人意
? There's so much that I still don't know ?

169
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:52,357
靠一己之力拯救公主
? To free this princess all on my own ?

170
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:55,427
十分坚难
? Is such a leap ?

171
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:59,130
十分危险
? A journey deep ?

172
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:13,111
在那未知的国度
? Into the great unknown ?

173
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,258
有陆地！
Land ho!

174
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,194


175
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,401
我们到了！
We're here!

176
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,169
安柏，快醒醒。
Amber, wake up.

177
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,271
干嘛呀？我们到哪儿了？
What's going on? Where are we?

178
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,907
我们到阿瓦洛了。
We're in Avalor.

179
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,610
收起船帆！
Ease the mainsail!

180
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:48,413


181
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,850
立正！
Attention!

182
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,327
很壮观，不是吗？
Quite a sight, is it not?

183
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,996
阿瓦洛王国。
The kingdom of Avalor.

184
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,999
在这么大的城市里我要怎么找到
How am I going to find Alacazar's house

185
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,769
阿拉卡扎的家啊？！
in that huge city?

186
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,103
早上好，巴期克斯将军。
Good morning, Admiral Vazquez.

187
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,838
国王陛下。
Your Majesty.

188
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,841
你能代我们向史瑞奇女王问好吗？
Have you sent word of our arrival to Queen Shuriki?

189
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,277
- 一小时前我已经派人去了。 - 很好。
- We sent a launch an hour ago. - Excellent.

190
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,979
你为什么要那样做？
Why did you do that?

191
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,947
向国王或女王问好是皇室成员
It's the royal custom to greet the king or queen

192
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,050
来访新王国时的惯例，苏菲亚。
when visiting a new kingdom, Sofia.

193
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,518
我们要去见她吗？
We have to meet her?

194
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,353
当然，这不是很好吗？
Yes. Isn't it exciting?

195
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,139
史瑞奇女王！
Queen Shuriki!

196
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,975
哦！别再那样子悄悄靠近我，埃斯特班。
Oh! Don't sneak up on me like that, Esteban.

197
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,311
你没看到我在为接见客人
Can't you see I'm putting on my best face

198
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,547
做准备吗？
for our visitors?

199
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,216
哦，我要等你准备好了再找你吗？
Oh, should I come back when you are finished?

200
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,585
我已经准备好了。
I am finished.

201
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:03,354
是的是的，女王陛下，我的疏忽。
Of course you are, my queen. My mistake.

202
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:06,958
是时候迎接罗伦国王了。
It is time to greet King Roland of Enchancia.

203
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,363
任何事情都得做到最好，阿芒多。
Everything must look its absolute best, Armando.

204
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,998
是的，女王陛下。
Yes, Your Grace.

205
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,701
我花了许多年时间来改造这里，
I have spent years making this the cleanest, quietest,

206
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:19,070
使它成为世上最有秩序的国家。
most orderly kingdom in the world.

207
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,005
任何事情都做得非常到位，
Nothing is out of place,

208
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,273
每个人都在做他们该做的，
everyone does what they're told,

209
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,409
不会抗命。
no unruliness.

210
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:31,116
没有讨厌的叮叮当当的铃声或者音乐，
No irritating jingle-jangle of bells or music.

211
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:33,251
只有简单的和平与宁静。
Just simple peace and quiet.

212
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,919
也没人会偷看我洗澡，女王陛下。
No one will make a peep, Your Grace.

213
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,056
当然除了我那些臣民们的欢呼声。
Except the cheers of my subjects, of course.

214
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:41,359
看来那些人又要欢呼一次了，
And the cheering crowds will be cheering this time,

215
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,695
说得对吧，埃斯特班？
correct, Esteban?

216
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:48,566
我们派了皇家卫队来镇压秩序。
We sent the royal guards ahead to offer encouragement.

217
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,034
很好！
Perfect.

218
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,906


219
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,975
你们好！你们好！
Hello. Hello.

220
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:03,581
看来我们很受欢迎！
This is quite a welcome.

221
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,416
我想说...
I'll say.

222
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,752
你们好，你们好！
Hello. Hello!

223
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,454
他们很喜欢我。
They really like me.

224
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:17,162
但他们更喜欢她。
they like her even more.

225
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:19,063
我得和她保持距离，安柏。
I'd keep my distance, Amber.

226
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,233
是的，你们爱戴的女王来了。
Yes, your beloved queen has arrived.

227
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,235
再欢呼一下吧！
Cheer like you mean it.

228
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:26,638
欢迎来到阿瓦洛！
Welcome to Avalor.

229
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,174
我是史瑞奇女王。
I am Queen Shuriki.

230
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:32,010
我是埃斯特班大臣。
And I am Chancellor Esteban.

231
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:34,179
你们能来我的的王国度假
It is an honor that you have chosen to visit

232
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,347
是我们的荣幸！
our humble kingdom.

233
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:39,818
很荣幸你们能如此热情的接待我们，史瑞奇女王。
You honor us with such a warm reception, Queen Shuriki.

234
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,452
那是阿瓦洛的习俗，罗伦国王。
That is the Avaloran way, King Roland.

235
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,188


236
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,390
哦，多么美妙的音乐！
Oh, what pretty music.

237
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:52,597
现在让我们去皇宫。
Now let us adjourn to the palace.

238
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,232
埃斯特班，那个长笛。
Esteban, the flute.

239
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,174
嘿！
Hey!

240
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,178


241
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,347
上去吧，公主。
After you, princess.

242
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,509
这座宫殿是在数百年前建成的，
The palace was built centuries ago.

243
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,012
我还有点事情要处理，如果你们要找我，
It's a little busy, if you ask me.

244
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,915
这里是我的大殿。
And this is my throne room.

245
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,250
我大部分时间都在这里。
I spend most of my time here.

246
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,252
看起来怎么样？
So what do you think?

247
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,121
那王座可真漂亮。
That's quite a throne.

248
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:25,123
谢谢！
Thank you.

249
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,692
为了建造这个我派人花了十年时间来挖钻石，
Took them over a decade to dig up all the diamonds.

250
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:30,395
但这值得等待。
But it was worth the wait.

251
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,096
别碰那个！
Don't touch that!

252
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,198
詹姆士，你的礼貌哪儿去了？
James, where are your manners?

253
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,101
这是一个非常脆弱的织制画像。
It's a very delicate fabric.

254
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,103
快过来，孩子。
Come along, my boy.

255
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,240
你们航行了这么长的时间一定饿了吧，
You must all be famished after such a long journey,

256
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:45,376
所以我...我是说，女王特意让厨师准备了
so I... I mean, the queen, had the chefs prepare

257
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,979
一些地道的美食。
a small taste of the local cuisine.

258
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,549
哦，这一路上的景色可真美啊
Oh, it's such a lovely view

259
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,284
史瑞奇女王！
from up here, Queen Shuriki.

260
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,887
我已经迫不及待想去城市里看看
I can't wait to go back down to the city

261
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,755
那些漂亮的老房子
and look at all the beautiful old houses.

262
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,123
老房子？
Old houses?

263
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,093
那就是你最想看的东西吗？亲爱的？
That's the last thing you should be looking at, dear.

264
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,262
我们的商场和公园绝对才是
Our marketplace and park lands

265
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,230
不二的选择。
are second to none.

266
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,632
埃斯特班，取消我的工作计划，
Esteban, clear my schedule.

267
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,434
我下午要亲自陪我们的客人
I shall personally give our guests

268
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,336
去城市里逛逛！
a tour of the city this afternoon.

269
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:14,339
嘿嘿！午餐吃什么？史瑞奇？
Hey, hey, what's for lunch, Shuriki?

270
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:15,440
那些是什么？
What are those?

271
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,275
噢，那是飞豹，
Oh, those are jaquins.

272
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,177
传说中的魔法生物，
Magical creatures of legend.

273
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,979
阿瓦洛的象征！
Majestic symbols of Avalor.

274
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,181
它们曾经被画在国旗上，
They used to be symbols of our kingdom.

275
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,350
但现在却只会令人生厌。
Now they are just a nuisance.

276
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:26,751
为什么？
Why is that?

277
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,787
因为我们会唱歌！哈哈！
Because we sing. Ha ha!

278
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,423
从迷雾丛林到高地
? From the misty jungle highlands ?

279
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,292
我们的翅膀永不停
? We fan our wings and fly ?

280
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,427
我们会逗人们笑
? To delight all Avalorans ?

281
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,863
我们也会惹人哭
? With our mighty jaquin cry ?

282
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,265
它们在唱歌！
They're singing!

283
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,101
你能相信吗，苏菲亚？
Can you believe that, Sofia?

284
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:44,335
会说话的动物！
Talking animals!

285
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,837
有谁以前见过或者听说过这种事吗？
Who ever heard of such a thing?

286
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,973
好东西要分享，朋友！
Let's dig in, amigos!

287
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:51,776
噢呵呵！看起来很好吃！
Oh, ho, ho, that looks tasty.

288
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:54,178
嘿！小心点，斯凯勒！
Hey, save room for dessert, Skylar.

289
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,180
不管是谁叫你们在外面吃饭
My compliments to the chef

290
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,216
都代我向厨师致谢！
and whoever said you should eat outside,

291
00:16:58,218 --> 00:16:59,817
因为这想法太赞啦！
'cause that is a great idea!

292
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,352
绝对赞！
Brilliant.

293
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,022
噢。。咻咻！快走开，看你们干的好事！
Oh, shoo. Get out of here, you pests.

294
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,057
啊？可我们才刚来啊！
Aw, but we just got here.

295
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,292
你可以命令别人该做些什么，
You can tell the people what to do,

296
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:09,527
但你不能命令我们！
but you can't boss us around.

297
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,195
你能拿我们怎么样？你又抓不到我们！
Mess with a jaquin, you get the claws.

298
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,731
你们闹够了没有，我已经忍无可忍了！
That's it. Enough is enough.

299
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,734
让我们进去吃，好吗？
Let's finish our meal inside, shall we?

300
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,670
好！好！好！
Yes, yes.

301
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,572
我们都进去吧！
Let's all go inside.

302
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:31,482


303
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:36,921
嗯，从史瑞奇那里拿来的食物味道真不错。
Mmm. Food tastes better when we take it from Shuriki.

304
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,223
把爪子舔干净。
It's paw-licking good.

305
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,225
芒果的味道真不错！
This mango is sublime.

306
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,361
呃，打扰一下！
Um, excuse me.

307
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:45,930
嘿，你还在外面做什么？
Hey, what are you still doing out here?

308
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,866
我不确定，但我想求你们帮我一个忙。
I'm not exactly sure, but maybe you can help me.

309
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,269
我们决不会帮史瑞奇的朋友。
We do not help friends of Shuriki.

310
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,104
我不是她的朋友。
I'm not her friend.

311
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,672
我的家人只是来这里度假。
My family had to visit the palace.

312
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,908
我真的很急着要找到阿拉卡扎的家。
I really came here to find Alacazar's house.

313
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,543
阿拉卡扎是谁？
Who's Alacazar?

314
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:01,412
很久以前的那个皇家巫师，记得吗？
He was the old royal wizard. Remember?

315
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,848
哦，想起来了！
Oh, yeah.

316
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,516
他不是在史瑞奇入侵之后就失踪了吗？
Didn't he split after Shuriki took over?

317
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,251
这能怪他吗？
Who can blame him?

318
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,886
她可能已经把他杀了，
She probably would've zapped him

319
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,456
就像国王和皇后一样，还有艾莲娜公主！
like the king and queen, and Princess Elena.

320
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,559
- 那么年轻！ - 那么勇敢！ - 可怜的艾莲娜！
- So young. - So brave. - Poor Elena.

321
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:17,095
好吧，如果我告诉你们我有办法能
Well, what if I told you I know a way

322
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,030
救回艾莲娜公主呢？
to bring Princess Elena back?

323
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:21,132
你最好不是在跟我开玩笑，小女孩！
You better not be toying with me, little girl,

324
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:24,268
因为我现在情绪很激动受不了半点刺激！
because I am highly emotional and extremely gullible.

325
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,204
我是认真的！
I'm telling the truth.

326
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,939
所以如果你们知道阿拉卡扎的家在那里，
So if one of you knows where Alacazar's house is,

327
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,707
就请带我去吧。
maybe you could take me there.

328
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:33,778
哇哦，你以为我们是什么，飞马吗？
Whoa ho now, what do we look like, flying horses?

329
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,613
你看到这背上有马鞍了吗？
Do you see a saddle on this back?

330
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,281
淡定，你们两个。
Relax, you two.

331
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,450
- 你叫什么名字？ - 苏菲亚。
- What's your name? - Sofia.

332
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,320
好吧苏菲亚，如果你真的能救回艾莲娜，
Well, Sofia, if you can bring back Elena,

333
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,722
我会带你去阿拉卡扎的家的，
I'll take you to Alacazar's house,

334
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:46,457
只要有人告诉我他在哪里。。
as soon as someone tells me where it is.

335
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,493
他家就在月亮下的悬崖底下。
It's right below the moon cliff.

336
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,094
有一位老前辈带我去过。
One of the old timers showed me once.

337
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,729
上来吧，公主殿下。
Hop on, Your Highness.

338
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,503
谢谢！
Thanks.

339
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:01,506
这可能需要习惯一下。
This is gonna take some getting used to.

340
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,341
抓稳了！
Hold on!

341
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:16,754
你们的国家可真美！
Your kingdom is beautiful.

342
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,423
在史瑞奇统治这里之前比现在还要好！
It looked even better before Shuriki took over.

343
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,525
当然了！
Sure did.

344
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,426
还有声音也很美！
And sounded better, too.

345
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:23,761
你什么意思？
What do you mean?

346
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,797
- 她规定唱歌会犯法！ - 为什么？
- She outlawed music. - Why?

347
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,367
因为她想要所有人都忘掉从前的阿瓦洛！
Because she wanted everyone to forget the old Avalor.

348
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:32,003
这就是为什么我们一直坚持唱歌。
That's why we jaquins still sing.

349
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:36,974
提醒大家阿瓦洛的精神仍然存在。
To remind everyone that the spirit of Avalor lives on.

350
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:39,043
这也是为什么史瑞奇会那么抓狂！
And 'cause it really bugs Shuriki.

351
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:42,313
在过去的日子里
? Way back in the old days ?

352
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:46,384
没有史瑞奇的日子里
? Before the time of Shuriki ?

353
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:49,554
你肯定总是听到有人唱歌
? You could always hear music ?

354
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:53,224
在城市的街道上
? In the streets of the city ?

355
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:56,460
虽然它现在很安静
? Although now it is quiet ?

356
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,963
甚至听不到钟声
? And the bells are not ringing ?

357
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:01,465
但如果你仔细听
? If you listen real closely ?

358
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:05,236
你会听见我们的内心仍在歌唱
? You can hear our hearts singing ?

359
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:07,972
在全国各地
? All across the kingdom ?

360
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:10,241
人们依然坚强
? The people are still strong ?

361
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:12,843
因为阿瓦洛的精神
? Because the spirit of Avalor ?

362
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,813
仍然存在
? Continues to live on ?

363
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,315
没错，女士们先生们
? Yes, every man and woman ?

364
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:18,816
不管是谁，不论何地
? Everyone, everywhere ?

365
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:21,485
即使是不懂事的孩子
? Even children do their parts ?

366
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:23,754
都仍然保留着阿瓦洛的精神
? To uphold the spirit of Avalor ?

367
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,591
他们的心里都在唱着一首歌
? With a song inside their hearts ?

368
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,259
阿瓦洛，阿瓦洛
? Avalor, Avalor ?

369
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,995
他们都仍然保留着阿瓦洛的精神
? They uphold the spirit of Avalor ?

370
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:37,068
他们的心里都在唱着一首歌
? With a song inside their hearts ?

371
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,670
女王禁止他们歌唱
? The queen hushes their voices ?

372
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:42,506
但我们很乐意为他们歌唱
? But we gladly sing for them ?

373
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:45,076
- 那些卫兵不喜欢那些
- ? The guards, they do not like it ?
- 是的，他们不喜欢。
- No, they don't.

374
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,612
- 但我们可以无视他们
- ? But we simply ignore them ?
- 是的，我们可以。
- Yes, we do.

375
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:50,548
我们都希望有一天
? We all yearn for the day when ?

376
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,750
能有人能将那老太婆驱逐
? That old queen is sent packin' ?

377
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,786
你会听到更美妙的音乐
? And you'll hear better music ?

378
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:59,223
- 比我们唱得更好听的歌声
- ? Than the sound of us jaquins ?
- 那是一定的！
- That's for sure!

379
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,559
在全国各地
? All across the kingdom ?

380
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:04,862
人们依然坚强
? The people are still strong ?

381
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,431
因为阿瓦洛的精神
? Because the spirit of Avalor ?

382
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,567
仍然存在
? Continues to live on ?

383
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,902
没错，女士们先生们
? Yes, every man and woman ?

384
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:13,437
不管是谁，不论何地
? Everyone, everywhere ?

385
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,805
即使是不懂事的孩子
? Even children do their part ?

386
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:18,242
都仍然保留着阿瓦洛的精神
? To uphold the spirit of Avalor ?

387
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:21,112
他们的心里都在唱着一首歌
? With a song inside their hearts ?

388
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,747
阿瓦洛，阿瓦洛
? Avalor, Avalor ?

389
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,715
从树梢上的鹦鹉
? From the parrots in their treetops ?

390
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:27,918
到马车上的商人
? To the merchants in their carts ?

391
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,488
都能感受到阿瓦洛的精神
? We feel the spirit of Avalor ?

392
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,491
在我们内心深处
? Way down deep inside our hearts ?

393
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,626
不管是谁，不论何地
? Everyone, everywhere ?

394
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,795
我们仍然保留着阿瓦洛的精神
? We hold the spirit of Avalor ?

395
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,464
阿瓦洛，阿瓦洛
? Avalor, Avalor ?

396
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,467
我们的心里都在唱着一首歌
? With a song inside our hearts ?

397
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:48,205
阿瓦洛，阿瓦洛
? Avalor, Avalor ?

398
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,482
就是这里了！
This is it.

399
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,584
唷！
Whew!

400
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:02,586
就当是锻炼了！
That was a workout.

401
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,332
你好，你有什么事吗？
Hello. Can I help you?

402
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:17,702
嗨！呃，这里是阿拉卡扎的家吗？
Hi. Uh, was this Alacazar's house?

403
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:20,438
阿拉卡扎？很抱歉，
Alacazar? I'm sorry,

404
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,541
他很多年前就已经去世了。
but he has not lived here for many years.

405
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:26,177
我知道，但也许你可以帮到我。
I know, but maybe you can help me.

406
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,145
我要召唤灵兽。
I need to summon his chanul.

407
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:30,214
我不明白你在说什么，
I don't know what that is,

408
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:31,949
但我恐怕这里没人能帮到你。
but I'm afraid you won't find it here.

409
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,185
日安。
Good day now.

410
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:35,953
好吧，也许这样更好。
Well, that could've gone better.

411
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,655
你怎么知道灵兽的事的？
How do you know what a chanul is?

412
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:39,190
噢，好吧……
Oh, well...

413
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,058
你刚才是在和我妈妈说话。
That was my mom you were just talking to.

414
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,326
我是马泰奥。
I'm Mateo.

415
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:44,562
等等，你是阿拉卡扎的孙子？
Wait. You're Alacazar's grandson?

416
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:45,996
你认识我爷爷？
You know my grandfather?

417
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:47,798
呃，算是吧！
Uh, sort of.

418
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,533
我叫苏菲亚。
My name is Sofia.

419
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,302
我知道这听起来很荒唐，
I know this might sound strange,

420
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:53,571
但你爷爷让我来这里
but your grandfather sent me here

421
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:55,005
救出艾莲娜公主。
to free Princess Elena.

422
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,574
艾莲娜公主？！
Princess Elena?!

423
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:58,342
等等，你是说……
Wait. That means...

424
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,978
那是阿瓦洛的护身符！
that's the Amulet of Avalor.

425
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,646
是啊！你怎么知道的？
Yes. How did you know?

426
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:04,415
我妈妈跟我提起过很多次。
My mother told me the story so many times,

427
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,883
我记得很清楚，请跟我来。
I memorized it. Follow me.

428
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,252
- 我们去哪儿？ - 去我的密室。
- Where are we going? - To my workshop.

429
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,492
祝我好运！
Wish me luck.

430
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,198
这条路可真长。
It's a long way down.

431
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,434
我知道，但这是唯一一个
I know, but it's the only way

432
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:24,769
能保证这里不被发现的办法。
to keep everything secret.

433
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,837
自从史瑞奇统治了这里，
When Queen Shuriki took over,

434
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,673
她就禁止除她以外的任何人使用魔法。
she banned all magic except her own.

435
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:31,709
所以阿瓦洛没有巫师？
So there are no wizards in Avalor?

436
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:33,411
也不是没有。
Not anymore.

437
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,679
我奶奶把我爷爷的东西都藏在了这里，
My grandma hid all my grandpa's things down here,

438
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:38,215
但我母亲从来没有用过这些东西。
but my mother never wanted anything to do with it.

439
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:40,084
所以这些东西都被锁起来了，
So it sat here all locked up

440
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,619
直到被我找到。
until I found it.

441
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:44,221
我一直在努力自学魔法。
I've been trying to teach myself magic ever since.

442
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,257
好的，让我想想。。
Okay, now let me think.

443
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,858
我只需要拿几样东西。
I just need a few things.

444
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:52,463
好了，请在这里坐下，苏菲亚。
Okay, sit here, Sofia.

445
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:54,365
为什么？
Why?

446
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:56,700
我要召唤我爷爷的灵兽。
We're going to summon my grandpa's chanul.

447
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,771
到底什么是灵兽？
What is a chanul exactly?

448
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,740
一种有灵性的动物鬼魂。
A spirit animal.

449
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:05,242
它就像是一个智者，是这世上最神奇的东西，
It's like a guide to all the magical stuff in the world

450
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:07,278
我们看不见它，艾莲娜公主也一样。
that we can't see, like Princess Elena.

451
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,113
我爷爷曾经把救出
It was my grandpa's chanul who figured out

452
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,882
艾莲娜公主的办法告诉了他的灵兽！
she was in the amulet and told him how to get her out.

453
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:13,717
找到了！
Here we go.

454
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:17,788
我的法器又去哪儿了？
Now where's my tamborita?

455
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,264
好的，这是我第一次施这个咒语，
Okay, this is the first time I've tried this incantation,

456
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:30,668
所以我可能要试个八九次
so it may not work for the first eight or nine times.

457
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,803
也许十次，咳咳……
Maybe ten. Ahem.

458
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:36,240
才能召唤出我爷爷的灵兽……
Appear to us, animal spirit of Alacazar.

459
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:39,810
<i>Illuminara Alacazar wayohel!（咒语）</i>

460
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:44,248
没关系。
It's okay.

461
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,650
我还有一根鼓槌，
I have another drumstick.

462
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,519
我们再试一次。
Let's try that again.

463
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:52,356
<i>Illuminara Alacazar wayohel!（咒语）</i>

464
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,829
哈？
Huh?

465
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,865
这是怎么回事？
What's happening?

466
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:02,933
我来啦！
I am.

467
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:04,869
为你送上来自冥界的问候！
Greetings from the spirit world!

468
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:06,337
你今天过得好吗？
How ya doin' today?

469
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,439
法力强大的灵兽啊！
O mighty chanul,

470
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:10,774
您的莅临是我们的光荣！
you honor us with your presence.

471
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:12,309
嘿，我知道你很兴奋。
Hey, I know you're excited.

472
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:14,111
我能看出来。
I get it.

473
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,780
并不是每天都能看到灵兽的，对吧？
It's not every day you meet a spirit animal, right?

474
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:19,116
但你召唤了我，
But you called me, I'm here,

475
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,885
所以我们应该跳过惊讶的部分
so we can skip all the fanfare,

476
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:22,820
谈谈正事行吗？
and get on with it, okay?

477
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:24,889
好的，法力强大的灵兽。
Of course, mighty chanul.

478
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:27,525
哦，你可以叫我祖佐。
Oh, you can call me Zuzo.

479
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:30,394
好的，法力强大的祖佐。
Yes, of course, mighty Zuzo.

480
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:32,196
你不用那样子叫我！
You don't have to call me anything.

481
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:36,567
所以你就是那位能拯救艾莲娜的公主。
So, you're the princess that's gonna free Elena.

482
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,736
我想是吧。
I guess so.

483
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:40,371
那好吧。
All right then.

484
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,640
那你打算怎么做？
Now here's what you gotta do.

485
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:44,708
等等，我以为只要召唤出你就可以了。
Wait. I thought I just had to summon you.

486
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,411
啊哈，我可以告诉你怎样救她。
Uh-huh, so I can tell you how to get her out.

487
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,713
这才是灵兽要做的。
That's what spirit guides do.

488
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,549
他们会指导你。
They guide you.

489
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:54,718
首先，想要救出艾莲娜你得拿到
First, you're gonna need the wand

490
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,753
对她施法的魔法棒。
that put Elena in there.

491
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:57,755
史瑞奇的魔法棒？
Queen Shuriki's wand?

492
00:25:57,757 --> 00:25:59,723
但她总是随身带着。
But she keeps it in her pocket.

493
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,158
那就对了。
That's great.

494
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,993
那样你就知道怎么找到它了。
You'll know exactly where to find it.

495
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:05,195
一但你拿到魔法棒，
Now, once you've got the wand,

496
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:07,164
你只需要把护身符绑在魔法棒上，
you just wrap the amulet around it

497
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,199
然后把魔法棒插在龙鸟的头顶上就行。
and put 'em on the crown of Aziluna.

498
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:11,735
- 谁的皇冠？ - 龙鸟。
- The crown of who? - Aziluna.

499
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,605
传说它的魔力能破解一切诅咒。
He was a great healer who could undo any spell or curse.

500
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:16,740
它是一座古老的玛鲁维安雕像，
There's an ancient Maruvian statue of him

501
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,409
就在这里最高的山上。
way up in the mountains.

502
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:21,045
听上去就像是个有魔法的医院。
It's kinda like a hospital for magical mishaps.

503
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:23,714
但是我不知道它在哪里，或者怎么到那里去，
But I don't know where it is, or how to get there,

504
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:26,383
也不知道怎么拿到史瑞奇的魔法棒。
or how I'm going to steal Shuriki's wand.

505
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:28,752
好的，先来做个深呼吸吧，
Okay, let's all take a big breath.

506
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:32,756
吸，呼，好极了。
In. Out. Good.

507
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,859
现在我可以给你提一些灵兽的智慧，
Now I've got some spirit animal wisdom for you.

508
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:38,028
只有你能做到的事
Just because you're the one

509
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,364
并不代表你要一个人去做。
doesn't mean you're the only one.

510
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:43,968
虽然现在对你没有任何意义，但你很快就会知道了。
That's not supposed to make any sense right now. You'll get it later.

511
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,638
但首先，你得去拿魔法棒，公主。
But first, you gotta go get that wand, princess.

512
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,641
好了，很高兴能指导你们，
All right, it's been a pleasure being your spirit guide today.

513
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:52,710
自己小心，拜拜！
Safe travels. Bye.

514
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:57,481
那感觉怎么样？！
How great was that?!

515
00:26:57,483 --> 00:27:00,584
我第一次召唤了灵兽！
I summoned my first chanul!

516
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:01,885
对不起！哇哦！
Sorry. Whoa!

517
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:06,924
嘿，你跳得真好，你肯定很擅长跳舞，是吗？
Hey, nice move. I bet you're a good dancer, aren't you?

518
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:08,726
我想我有办法拿到魔法棒了，
That's how I'll get her wand.

519
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:10,628
我要陪她跳舞。
I'll dance with her.

520
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,062
没用的，
That won't work.

521
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:14,898
史瑞奇不允许有人跳舞或者唱歌。
Shuriki outlawed dancing when she banned music.

522
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,967
虽然我妈妈还教过我跳桑巴罗萨。
My mom still taught me the sambarosa, though.

523
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,338
- 我们得马上回皇宫。 - 我们？
- We have to go back to the palace. - We?

524
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:25,576
当农夫跟着她进入丛林，
And when the farmer followed her into the jungle,

525
00:27:25,578 --> 00:27:30,247
她突然变成一只凶猛的豹子！
she turned into a jaguar!

526
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,349
实际上，她是一个邪恶的女巫，
But really, she was a wicked witch

527
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:33,917
并且控制了整个丛林。
who had taken over the jungle.

528
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,020
农夫想要逃跑...
The farmer tried to escape...

529
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:39,456
我们的王国有一大片的农场
Our kingdom has a wide array of enchanted agriculture,

530
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,859
和牧场，更不用说
and creatures, not to mention

531
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:42,960
那些飞马了。
our flying horses.

532
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:44,862
取消和魔法王国的贸易来往吧，
Forget trading with Enchancia.

533
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:46,530
我们应该占领它。
We should invade it.

534
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:48,999
我们到了，公主殿下。
Here you are, princess.

535
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,834
你去哪儿了，苏菲亚？
You were out there a while, Sofia.

536
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,503
我在听那些飞豹唱歌。
The jaquins sang me a song.

537
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:55,839
是啊，它们除了唱歌还会做什么，
Yes, they can't seem to stop doing that.

538
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,442
这样吧，阿芒多在表演一个节目，
Well, Armando is putting on a show

539
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,944
如果你也想看的话就陪他们一起看吧。
for the other little darlings if you want to join them.

540
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:02,946
实际上，我听说过很多关于阿瓦洛舞蹈的事情，
Actually, I was hoping to learn

541
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:05,182
所以我很想学习一下
one of the Avaloran dances I've heard so much about.

542
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,017
桑巴罗萨。
The sambarosa.

543
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,487
噢，我恐怕不能教你了，因为我不会跳舞。
Oh, I'm afraid I don't know that dance.

544
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:12,790
但这是阿瓦洛最有名的舞蹈！
It's the most famous dance in Avalor.

545
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:15,793
我可以教她。
I can teach it to her.

546
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:17,861
不，你不会的，阿芒多。
No, you won't, Armando.

547
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,797
还要茶吗？女王陛下？
More tea, Your Grace?

548
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:23,801
为什么不？有规定跳舞会犯法吗？
Why not? Is there some kind of law against dancing?

549
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:26,970
苏菲亚，没人规定跳舞会犯法，
Sofia, no one would pass a law against dancing.

550
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:29,073
就像是用法律来禁止乐趣！
That's like passing a law against fun.

551
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:31,542
那好吧，在阿瓦洛，我们...
Well, in Avalor, we--

552
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,744
我们只在特殊场合跳舞，
We only dance on special occasions,

553
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:35,813
比如现在。
like royal visits.

554
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:37,915
所以我们很高兴能为你献上桑巴罗萨。
So we will be happy to show you the sambarosa.

555
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:39,316
对吧？女王陛下？
Right, Your Grace?

556
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:40,984
如果真有必要的话！
If we must.

557
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:42,886
我去拿吉他。
Let me fetch the guitar.

558
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,588
太好了！
Great.

559
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:50,027
跳桑巴罗萨的秘决就在于
This is how you dance the sambarosa.

560
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:53,030
把手这样舞动，脚要像这样跺。
You join hands and stomp your feet like this.

561
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:54,932
在你舞伴面前转圈。
Move back and forth, then twirl your partner.

562
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:57,101
哇哦！
Whoo!

563
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:59,236
来吧，都试一下！
Come on. Everyone try!

564
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:04,274


565
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:08,912


566
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,581


567
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,686
史瑞奇女王，你能陪我跳舞吗？
Queen Shuriki, will you dance with me?

568
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:17,755
噢，你可真可爱，
Oh, how sweet of you to offer,

569
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:20,758
但我更喜欢看着你跳。
but I'm having too much fun watching you.

570
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,893
但我相信你肯定跳得比别人都好。
But I'm sure you dance better than anyone.

571
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:23,961
可以吗？
Please?

572
00:29:23,963 --> 00:29:27,064
我怎么会拒绝这么可爱的小孩子呢？
How can I say no to such a dear child?

573
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:28,632


574
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:35,405
嗷！
Ow!

575
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:38,642
真对不起，女王陛下，是我太笨了。
So sorry, Your Grace. I'm so clumsy.

576
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:41,345
跳够了没有！
Enough dancing!

577
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:45,582


578
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:48,619
我是说，我们跳得很高兴，
I mean, so delightful.

579
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:51,755
但我们应该继续讨论我们刚才的话题，
We really must get back to our discussions,

580
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:53,323
国王陛下。
Your Majesties.

581
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,058
我们可以去玩捉迷藏吗？
Can we play hide-and-seek?

582
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,161
好的好的，你想怎样都行，亲爱的！
Yes, yes, yes. Whatever you want, dear.

583
00:29:57,163 --> 00:30:00,864
我们可以先处理这些事情，埃斯特班。
We can dispose of that now, Esteban.

584
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,836
苏菲亚，我不想玩捉迷藏。
Sofia, I don't wanna play hide-and-seek.

585
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:07,437
很好玩的，安柏。
It'll be fun, Amber.

586
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:10,607
你只要藏起来，然后你来找，阿芒多？
Is it okay if we hide and you seek, Mr. Armando?

587
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,910
噢，好的，那肯定很有意思。
Oh, of course. That would be delightful.

588
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:18,015
好了，一，二，三，四...
Okay. One, two, three, four...

589
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:20,083
快来！
Come on.

590
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:23,120
五，六，七，八...
Five, six, seven, eight...

591
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:24,988


592
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,024
你上哪儿去？苏菲亚？
What are you up to, Sofia?

593
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:28,525
我等一下再告诉你，
I'll explain later,

594
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:30,360
但我要你们藏得越隐蔽越好。
but I need you both to hide as long as you can.

595
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:31,829
这很重要！
It's important.

596
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:34,031
- 我们会的，苏菲亚。 - 你为什么不告诉我们原因？
- You got it, Sof. - Why won't you tell us?

597
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:36,733
这是为了你们好，相信我。
It's for your own good, trust me.

598
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:41,905
哼。。
Hmm.

599
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:53,050
我拿到了！
I got it!

600
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:54,618
快上来，苏菲亚！
Right on, Sofia!

601
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,186
我不知道你是怎么拿到的。
I don't know how you pulled that off.

602
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,722
史瑞奇决不会让任何人靠近她。
Shuriki never lets anyone get close to her.

603
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,324
看看她。
Look at her.

604
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:03,060
身怀绝技的可爱小女孩儿！
Girl looks sweet as sugar, but she's got some skills.

605
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:05,195
好了马泰奥，带我们去找龙鸟吧！
Okay, Mateo, show us the way to Aziluna.

606
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,464
我们要去拯救公主喽！
We've got a princess to free.

607
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:37,194
那是什么？
What's that?

608
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:39,096
一处古老的玛鲁维安遗址。
An old Maruvian temple.

609
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:40,731
雕像就在里面！
The statue is inside.

610
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:48,238
哇！伙伴们，这地方可真够大的。
Whoa, man, they really let the place go.

611
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,707
玛鲁人在几个世纪以前就消失了，
The Maruvians vanished centuries ago.

612
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,110
没人知道到底发生了什么，也没人知道他们去哪儿了！
No one knows what happened to them or where they went.

613
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:57,180
只留下了这些古建筑遗址
All that's left of the ancient civilization of Maru are ruins like this.

614
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:11,261
雕像在哪里？
Where's the statue?

615
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,130
好吧，传说是
Well, legend has it

616
00:32:13,132 --> 00:32:14,965
要游到水底才能找到
you need to swim across the enchanted waters

617
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,199
解除咒语的方法。
for the magic to work.

618
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:20,103
会没事的，苏菲亚，祝你好运！
You'll be fine, Sofia. Good luck.

619
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,672
那好吧！
Okay.

620
00:32:24,977 --> 00:32:26,843


621
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,284
如果我现在能变成美人鱼
Being a mermaid would really come in handy

622
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,186
会方便许多！
right about now.

623
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:40,490
哇哦！你看到那个了吗？
Whoa! Did you see that?

624
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,626
要是我也能那样随意变身就好了！
I wish I could shape shift that easily.

625
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,144
那一定就是了！
That must be it.

626
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,847
好的，我要把护身符绑在魔法棒上，
Right. I have to put the amulet and wand

627
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:06,750
然后插在龙鸟的头顶上。
on the crown of Aziluna.

628
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:16,360
哇哦？！
Whoa!

629
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,312
哇哦！！
Whoa!

630
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,384
我的护身符，
My amulet.

631
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,585
变成红色了！
It changed color.

632
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:21,291
艾莲娜公主？
Princess Elena?

633
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:35,338


634
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,340
我自由了！
I'm free!

635
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:39,943
我终于自由了！哇哦。。
I'm finally free! Whoa!

636
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,847
- 你还好吗？ - 我很好！
- Are you okay? - I'm good.

637
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:46,049
我很好，我猜要是你
I'm good. I guess that's what happens

638
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:48,919
也被困在护身符里41年的话，
when you're stuck inside an amulet for 41 years.

639
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,253
你肯定都忘记怎么走路了！
You forget how to walk.

640
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,788
我就知道你能做到！
I knew you were the one!

641
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,057
谢谢你！
Thank you.

642
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:56,293
不用...谢！
You're... welcome.

643
00:34:58,063 --> 00:34:59,629
艾莲娜公主！
Princess Elena!

644
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,431
噢，飞豹！
Oh, jaquins.

645
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,599
艾莲娜公主。
Princess Elena.

646
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,034
艾莲娜公主...啊...
Princess Elena!

647
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:05,168


648
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,204
我是马泰奥。
I'm Mateo.

649
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:08,572
阿拉卡扎的孙子。
Alacazar's grandson.

650
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:11,475
噢，你不用向我行礼，马泰奥！
Oh, you don't have to bow, Mateo.

651
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:14,044
还有叫我艾莲娜就好！
And you can just call me Elena.

652
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:15,745
好的，艾莲娜。
Okay, Elena.

653
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,414
我简直不敢相信你真的回来了！
I can't believe you're really back.

654
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:19,049
我也一样！
Neither can I.

655
00:35:19,051 --> 00:35:20,550
我被困在护身符里那么久，
I was in the amulet so long,

656
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:22,586
我以为我再也没有机会出来了，
I thought I might never get out.

657
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:23,753
但我真的出来了！
But here I am.

658
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:26,590
那感觉真奇怪
? It feels so weird ?

659
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:29,559
我的脚就踩在地上
? Having my feet on the ground ?

660
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:34,331
却不知道怎么走路
? It's been a while since I've been walking around ?

661
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:39,936
睁开我的眼睛，又能再次看见
? With my own eyes, I can once again see ?

662
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:42,572
我的梦想终已成真
? My dream has come true ?

663
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:50,780
我自由了
? I am free ?

664
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:54,451
但我现在还有件事情要做
? But now that I'm here, there's a mission at hand ?

665
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:57,487
把那巫婆赶出我们的王国
? To drive that witch out of our beautiful land ?

666
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:00,857
我要驱逐黑暗带回光明
? I'll banish the darkness and bring back the light ?

667
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:03,326
因为这一次
? 'Cause this time ?

668
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:07,330
我已准备战斗
? I'm ready to fight ?

669
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,534
这是我的时刻
? This is my time ?

670
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:14,638
是时候去面对我的老对手
? My time to face my old foe ?

671
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,841
我的时刻
? My time ?

672
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:20,443
夺回我们失去已久的东西
? Reclaim what was ours long ago ?

673
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:24,681
这是我的时刻
? This is my time ?

674
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:28,518
站起来，为了荣誉和自尊
? To stand up with honor and pride ?

675
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,354
我的时刻
? My time ?

676
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,057
我已经被抛弃得
? I've come too far ?

677
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:38,428
太远了
? To be denied ?

678
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:45,202
现在我要飞回我的皇宫
? Now off I must fly to the palace once more ?

679
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:48,538
赢回阿瓦洛人民的自由
? To win back the freedom of all Avalor ?

680
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,875
我一生都在等待这一天
? I've spent my whole life waiting just for this day ?

681
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:58,381
没有什么可以阻挡我
? And nothing will get in my way ?

682
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:02,319
这是我的时刻
? This is my time ?

683
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:06,022
我有一个绝不失败的计划
? I have a plan that can't fail ?

684
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:09,159
我的时刻
? My time ?

685
00:37:09,161 --> 00:37:12,495
在我成功之前我绝不罢休
? I won't stop till I prevail ?

686
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:15,899
我的时刻
? My time ?

687
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:19,436
为了家人和朋友的荣誉
? To honor my family and friends ?

688
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:22,606
我的时刻
? My time ?

689
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:29,412
这是我的时刻，又一次
? This is my time, once again ?

690
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:35,752
这是我的时刻
? This is my time ?

691
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:43,426
再一次
? Once again ?

692
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:52,702
好了，我会在城市等你们回来。
Okay, I'll see you back in the city.

693
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:53,903
你要去哪儿？
Where are you going?

694
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:56,806
去让史瑞奇尝尝自己的魔法。
To give Shuriki a taste of her own magic.

695
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:59,442
但史瑞奇法力强大！
But Queen Shuriki is really powerful.

696
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,910
不是她，是她的魔法棒
Not without her wand.

697
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:02,646
等一下，我要和你一起去。
Wait. I'll come with you.

698
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:04,447
- 我也去。 - 不！
- Me, too. - No.

699
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,150
不用了，你们已经为我冒了太多险，
No. You've already risked so much for me.

700
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:08,985
这件事我要一个人做！
This is something I have to do alone.

701
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:10,654
我们走！
Let's go.

702
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:16,126
我们得帮帮她，快跟上！
We've got to help her. Let's go.

703
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:19,462
说得对，快走，鲁娜，追上艾莲娜！
Right. Go, Luna. Catch that princess.

704
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,964
没问题！
Let's do it!

705
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:25,235
那些孩子都去哪儿了？
Where are those children?

706
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:27,737
快出来，快出来，不管你们在哪里！
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

707
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,639
都出来吧。
Any of you.

708
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,007
求你们了！
Please.

709
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:41,685
要我陪你一起去吗？
You want me to go with you?

710
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:43,586
谢谢，但我不会有事的！
Thanks, but I've got this.

711
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:51,995
贸易协议已经准备好，
The trade agreement is ready

712
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,763
只要签字就行，女王陛下！
for your signature,Your Grace.

713
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:59,703
签好了，现在拿去给...
Done. Now that that's taken care of...

714
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:01,137
史瑞奇！
Shuriki!

715
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:02,572
- 嗯？ - 嗯？
- Huh? - Huh?

716
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:07,110
艾莲娜公主！
Princess Elena!

717
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:09,679
是时候让你为你的所做所为付出代价了！
The time has come to pay for your crimes.

718
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,648
代价？什么代价？
Crimes? What crimes?

719
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,283
史瑞奇入侵了阿瓦洛，
Shuriki invaded Avalor,

720
00:39:13,285 --> 00:39:15,385
并且推翻了皇室的统治！
and overthrew the royal family.

721
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:16,453
我父亲的统治！
My family.

722
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:17,554
这是真的吗？
Is this true?

723
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:19,956
噢，艾莲娜，
Oh, Elena.

724
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,858
一些人有资格继承王位，
Some inherit their kingdoms.

725
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,395
但另一些人得靠强大的力强！
Others have to take theirs by force.

726
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:26,696
嘿！
Hey!

727
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,798
所以我要靠这个来夺回我的一切！
Then I'm here to take mine back.

728
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,569
但阿瓦洛没有你更加繁荣昌盛，
But Avalor has been so much better without you.

729
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:34,637
为什么一定要搅和这么好的事情呢？
Why ruin a good thing?

730
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:39,309
在找这个吗？
Looking for this?

731
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:41,010
怎么会在你那里？
How did you get that?

732
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:42,545
肯定是那个小公主，
It was that little princess.

733
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,880
戴项链的那个！
The one with the necklace.

734
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,316
等等，苏菲亚参与了这件事？
Wait. Sofia's involved in this?

735
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:49,486
没错，就是她把我从护身符里放出来的，
Yes. She freed me from her amulet,

736
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:51,588
所以我才有机会夺回阿瓦洛！
so that I could free Avalor from you.

737
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,256
噢，我居然被她耍了！
Oh, I don't know about that.

738
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:56,259
但你不是女巫根本控制不了这么强大的魔法棒。
It takes more than a wand to make you a sorceress.

739
00:39:56,261 --> 00:40:00,063
你的咒语在我的脑海里回荡了40多年，史瑞奇！
Your spell has echoed in my mind for 40 years, Shuriki.

740
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,865
我知道该怎么用！
I know it by heart.

741
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:03,733
<i>Vadisima!（咒语）</i>

742
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,935


743
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:09,205
看来你要更努力才行喽！
You'll have to do better than that.

744
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,774
<i>Vadisima!（咒语）</i>

745
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:17,680


746
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:22,252
这是什么？
What is this?

747
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:24,788
我以前从没见过这幅画。
I've never seen this painting before.

748
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,791
哦，这不是普通的画，艾莲娜。
Oh, that's no ordinary painting, Elena.

749
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:31,428
阿拉卡扎为了保护你妹妹和你祖父母
That's how Alacazar protected your little sister and grandparents--

750
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:36,199
将他们封印在这幅画里，连我都无法破解！
inside an enchanted painting even my magic cannot touch.

751
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:39,602
爷爷！奶奶！
Abuelo. Abuela.

752
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,371
伊莎贝尔！
Isabel.

753
00:40:41,373 --> 00:40:43,440
说到家人，
And speaking of family,

754
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:47,043
你还没向你表哥埃斯特班打招呼呢！
you haven't said hello to your cousin Esteban.

755
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:48,711


756
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:50,280
不！
No.

757
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,215
他不可能是埃斯特班！
This cannot be Esteban.

758
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:55,285
你被困在护身符里太久了，
You were stuck in that amulet a long time.

759
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:59,055
你或许还是16岁，但埃斯特班已经老了！
You may still be 16, but Esteban grew up.

760
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:00,757
等等，你在帮她做事？
Wait. You're with her?

761
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:03,460
我...我别无选择，艾莲娜！
I... I had no choice, Elena.

762
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:06,563
是这样吗？埃斯特班？
Is that so, Esteban?

763
00:41:06,565 --> 00:41:08,698
<i>Vadisima!（咒语）</i>

764
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:11,734
抓住她！
Seize her!

765
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:18,241


766
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:20,510
找到你们啦！
Found ya!

767
00:41:20,512 --> 00:41:21,678
哦！
Oh!

768
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:24,848
哈？发生什么了？
Uh, what's going on?

769
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,683
没什么，阿芒多。
Nothing, Armando.

770
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:28,852
我只是在让这一切变得有条理！
I'm just setting things back in order.

771
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:31,020
嘿，你太慢了，史瑞奇！
Hey, not so fast, Shuriki!

772
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:32,021


773
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:34,324
跳上来，艾莲娜！
Hop on, Elena.

774
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:36,426
不，等一下，不要走，斯凯勒。
No, wait. Don't leave, Skylar.

775
00:41:36,428 --> 00:41:39,462
<i>Vadisima!（咒语）</i>
卫兵，拦住他们！
Guards, stop them!

776
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,498
给我在黄昏之前抓住她！
I want her captured by nightfall.

777
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,932
还有那个小公主！
Her and that little princess.

778
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,701
这不关苏菲亚的事！
Leave Sofia out of this.

779
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:47,203
先把他们关起来。
And lock them up while you're at it.

780
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:48,938
把你的手拿开！
Get your hands off me!

781
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,440
你会后悔的！
You'll regret this.

782
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:51,674
我才不信你的鬼话！
I doubt it.

783
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,444
停下，停下！
Wait. Wait.

784
00:41:54,446 --> 00:41:56,212
斯凯勒，我们得回去！
Skylar, we have to go back.

785
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:58,214
为什么？好让她干掉你吗？
Why? So she can finish you off?

786
00:41:58,216 --> 00:41:59,849
你很勇敢，公主，
You are brave, princess,

787
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,785
但你的计划实在是太烂了！
but your battle strategy, not so good.

788
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:04,854
艾莲娜，这是怎么了？
Elena, what happened?

789
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,890
我尽力了，苏菲亚，
I tried my best, Sofia,

790
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:08,391
但我并不知道会导致这样的，
but I couldn't get the spell right,

791
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:09,959
史瑞奇抓住了你的家人！
and Shuriki has your family now.

792
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,694
她抓住了我的家人？
She has my family?

793
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,496
我真的很抱歉！
I'm so sorry.

794
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:15,832
她在那里，弓箭手，瞄准目标，
There she is. Archers, lock your arrows.

795
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:17,734
放箭！
Draw!

796
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:19,836
哇哦，他们在向我们射箭！
Whoa. They're shooting arrows!

797
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:21,971
快躲开，不要飞直线！
Evasive action. Dodge and weave.

798
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:23,540
好的！我们那样
Yeah, we could do that.

799
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:25,141
也许有机会逃出去。
Or we could just get on up outta here.

800
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:28,043
- 我们可以去我家里。 - 太好了，抓稳了！
- We can go to my place. - Great. Hang on.

801
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:46,462
噢，真希望他们没事！
Oh, I hope they're okay.

802
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:55,271
怎么会发生这种事？罗伦，苏菲亚到底去哪儿了？
This is not okay, Roland. Where is Sofia?

803
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:58,741
我会有办法出去的，美兰达，我们也会找到苏菲亚的！
I will get us out of here, Miranda, and we will find Sofia.

804
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:02,345
囚犯们已经被关起来了，埃斯特班大臣。
The prisoners are secured, Chancellor Esteban.

805
00:43:02,347 --> 00:43:04,614
那些囚犯可是皇室成员，
Those prisoners are royalty,

806
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:06,215
你就这样对待他们？
and you will treat them as such.

807
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:08,017
是的，埃斯特班大臣。
Yes, chancellor.

808
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:11,621
哎呀呀！真是一波未平一波又起呀！
Ay yi yi. Yet another mess to clean up.

809
00:43:11,623 --> 00:43:13,890
这么说艾莲娜公主还活着？
So Princess Elena lives.

810
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:16,025
很显然。
Apparently so.

811
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:17,694
她是王位的合法继承人。
She is the rightful heir to the throne.

812
00:43:17,696 --> 00:43:19,128
我们应该帮帮她！
We should be helping her.

813
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,197
你想要我们怎么做，嗯？
What do you suggest we do, hmm?

814
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,866
向女王发起挑战？可我们还是会输。
Fight the queen? Because we will lose.

815
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:25,868
但艾莲娜是的表妹啊，埃斯特班！
But Elena's your cousin, Esteban.

816
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,805
她的祖父母视我如己出，
And her grandparents raised me like a son.

817
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:31,207
我每天都在回想当时发生的一切，
And I think about what happened to them every day.

818
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:34,844
所以不用你提醒我该怎么做，阿芒多。
So I do not need you to remind me, Armando.

819
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:58,901
艾莲娜，那里发生了什么？
Elena, what happened back there?

820
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:04,474
直到今天我才知道
I never knew what happened

821
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:07,577
在我妹妹和祖父母身上发生了什么。
to my sister and my grandparents until today.

822
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:10,079
看到他们被困在那幅画里，
Seeing them trapped in that painting

823
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:12,682
让我想起我最后一次见到伊莎贝尔的时候。
reminded me of the last time I saw Isabel.

824
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:15,151
- 伊莎贝尔？ - 我妹妹。
- Isabel? - My little sister.

825
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:17,854
她整天都呆在花园里，
She'd been out in the garden all day,

826
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:19,822
给那些飞豹造喂料机。
building a new feeder for the jaquins.

827
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,858
还把自己弄得一身脏，
She was filthy,

828
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,993
爸爸妈妈要赶回家吃晚饭
and our parents were on their way home for dinner,

829
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,828
所以我叫她去换身衣服，
so I asked her to change.

830
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,930
她就换了干净的裙子回来了，
And she comes back wearing a clean dress,

831
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:32,135
但手上和脸上还是一团糟，
but her hands and face are still covered in dirt.

832
00:44:32,137 --> 00:44:35,004
我刚帮她擦干净
I had just finished cleaning her off

833
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:39,275
就听到了外面有马车的声音
when I heard our parents' carriage pull up outside.

834
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:41,678
然后，史瑞奇来了。
And then, Shuriki arrived.

835
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,546
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

836
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:46,649
当我看到她被封印在画里的时候，
When I saw her in that enchanted painting today,

837
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:48,885
发现她的脸上还有一团泥巴，
she still had a smudge on her cheek.

838
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:50,787
我猜肯定是我忽略了。
I guess I missed a spot.

839
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:53,222


840
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:56,659
我们有能救出他们的咒语。
We have the spell that can get them out.

841
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:58,027
- 我们有吗？ - 当然有！
- We do? - We do.

842
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,396
你爷爷在他离开之前告诉过我，
Your grandfather showed me where it was

843
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:03,366
但我从没学过魔法，
before he left, but I never learned magic,

844
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:05,168
所以我没法解除咒语。
so I cannot cast the spell.

845
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:07,070
但你可以，马泰奥。
You will have to do it, Mateo.

846
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:09,872
啊，你为什么认为我可以呢？
And, uh, why would I be able to do it?

847
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:12,375
马泰奥，你以前在地下室里
Mateo, you're down there in the basement

848
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:14,544
没日没夜的练习魔法，
practicing magic day and night.

849
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:15,912
你以为我不知道吗？
You think I don't know this?

850
00:45:15,914 --> 00:45:18,147
但是艾莲娜，我必需提醒你，
But Elena, I must warn you.

851
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:21,350
在打败史瑞奇之前最好不要救他们出来，
To bring them out with Shuriki still in power

852
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:23,352
那会让他们陷入危险之中。
will put them in great danger.

853
00:45:23,354 --> 00:45:25,988


854
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:29,025
有人来了，快藏起来，马上！
We have visitors. Quick, hide, over there.

855
00:45:29,027 --> 00:45:32,628
好的，来啦，来啦！
Okay. Coming, coming.

856
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:37,934
拉法，你听说了吗？
Rafa, did you hear?

857
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:40,536
他们说艾莲娜公主回来了。
They're saying that Princess Elena has returned.

858
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:43,539
哦，快，快进来！
Oh, hurry. Hurry. Come inside.

859
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:45,575
我们得小心点！
We have to be careful.

860
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:47,510
艾莲娜公主，没事的，
Princess Elena, it's okay.

861
00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:49,412
我们可以信任他们！
We can trust them.

862
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:54,183
这是真的！
It is true.

863
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:56,052
公主还活着！
The princess lives!

864
00:45:56,054 --> 00:45:57,120
我的公主。
My princess.

865
00:45:57,122 --> 00:45:59,088
你们不用向我行礼。
You don't have to bow.

866
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,590
哦，好吧！
Oh, okay.

867
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:02,125
我们随时听候您的差遣。
We are at your command.

868
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:04,794
跟史瑞奇抗争到底！
I will take on Shuriki myself.

869
00:46:04,796 --> 00:46:06,696
谢谢你，你们大家，
Thank you, all of you,

870
00:46:06,698 --> 00:46:09,065
但这是我的战斗，不是你们的。
but this is my fight, not yours.

871
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:11,801
我必须独自面对她。
I'm the one who must face her.

872
00:46:11,803 --> 00:46:15,805
只有你能做到的事并不代表你要一个人去做。
You may be the one, but you're not the only one.

873
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,641
祖佐告诉我的，我想我知道这是什么意思了！
Zuzo said that, and now I know what he meant.

874
00:46:18,643 --> 00:46:20,443
那好吧，那是什么意思？
Okay. What did he mean?

875
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:22,945
我们都可以帮到你，你不用独自面对史瑞奇。
We can all help. You don't need to face Shuriki alone.

876
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:25,248
你只要告诉我们该怎么做。
You just need to tell us what to do.

877
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,084
你知道吗？我从护身符里
You know, all this time

878
00:46:28,086 --> 00:46:30,787
出来的时候，我一直以为我是一个人，
I was stuck in the amulet, I thought I was alone,

879
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:33,156
但你说得对，苏菲亚，我不应该这样想，
but you're right, Sofia. It doesn't have to be that way.

880
00:46:33,158 --> 00:46:34,991
我还有你们。
I have all of you.

881
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:39,061
是啊，但我们要怎么对付史瑞奇和那些士兵呢？
Yeah, but what good are we against Shuriki and all her soldiers?

882
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:41,564
我还在想，
I'm still figuring that out,

883
00:46:41,566 --> 00:46:43,766
但我需要所有人的帮助！
but I'm going to need everyone's help.

884
00:46:43,768 --> 00:46:45,601
- 我们与你同在。 - 一直都是！
- We're with you. - All the way.

885
00:46:45,603 --> 00:46:46,969
不只是你们，
Not just you.

886
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,704
我是说所有人！
Everyone.

887
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:16,833
我们在哪儿？
Where are we?

888
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:19,135
这是通往皇宫的一条秘道。
A secret back entrance to the palace.

889
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:22,605
我以为我永远都不会走这条路。
Not that I ever snuck out when I wasn't supposed to.

890
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,317
我在会合的地方找你，斯凯勒。
I'll see you at the rendezvous point, Skylar.

891
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,953
你最好！
You better.

892
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:39,322
我们要怎么找到我的家人？
How will we find my family?

893
00:47:39,324 --> 00:47:41,724
史瑞奇只会把他们关在一个地方。
There's only one place Shuriki would've put them.

894
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:46,629
艾莲娜公主？！
Princess Elena?!

895
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:50,633
你好，你看上去是个好人，
Hey there. You look like a nice guy

896
00:47:50,635 --> 00:47:52,535
谁想做正确的事？
who just wants to do the right thing.

897
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:55,037
我吗？我是说，我想！
I do? I mean, I do.

898
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,706
无论什么事情，公主。
Whatever you need, princess.

899
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:58,074
我都会听候你的差遣！
I am at your service.

900
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,213
啊嗯，打扰一下，
Ahem. Excuse me,

901
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,716
史瑞奇女王想让你们两个去
but Queen Shuriki wants the both of you

902
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:08,351
给她报告情况。
to report to her right away.

903
00:48:08,353 --> 00:48:11,254
我去，你守在这里。
I'll go. You stay here.

904
00:48:11,256 --> 00:48:13,923
不行，她说让你们两个都去！
No, but she asked to see the both of you.

905
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:15,725
我们中必须有个人守着囚犯。
One of us has to watch the prisoners.

906
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:17,994
嗯，等一下，别关门！
Um, wait. Hold on.

907
00:48:19,764 --> 00:48:21,597
好痛！
That hurts.

908
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,267
噢，还有一个守卫留在那里。
Oh, one of the guards wouldn't leave.

909
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:26,402
苏菲亚，如果你能变小
Sofia, if you shrank down,

910
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,905
就可以偷偷绕过那个警卫。
you could sneak right past that guard.

911
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:30,606
但你已经不在我的护身符里了，
But you're not in my amulet anymore.

912
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:32,375
你觉得我还有那种能力吗？
Do you think I still have my powers?

913
00:48:32,377 --> 00:48:34,410
只有一种办法可以知道。
There's only one way to find out.

914
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,779
我希望我能变小。
I wish I was small.

915
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:40,082


916
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:43,286
阿芒多，我需要你去分散警卫的注意力。
Armando, I need you to distract the guard.

917
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:48,457
你好，打扰一下，你好！
Hello. Excuse me. Hello.

918
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:50,293
又怎么了？
What is it now?

919
00:48:50,295 --> 00:48:52,895
有一件非常非常重要的事情，
There's something very, very important

920
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:54,597
我必须告诉你，就在这里。
I must tell you. Over here.

921
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:00,002
我想要变回来。
I wish to be big again.

922
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,411
- 嗨！ - 苏菲亚！
- Hi. - Sofia!

923
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:09,645
嘘！我们得赶紧。
Sh. We have to hurry.

924
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:11,080
你要解释的事情够多了！
You have a lot of explaining to do.

925
00:49:11,082 --> 00:49:13,816
妈妈，我...会解释的，我保证！
Mom, I will... later. I promise.

926
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:16,819
但现在我们得想个办法对付警卫！
But right now, we have to find a way to get past that guard.

927
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:19,088
我来对付他。
I'll take care of him.

928
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,557
当农夫跟着她进入丛林，
And when the farmer followed her into the jungle,

929
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:24,961
她突然变成了一只凶猛的豹子！
she turned into a jaguar!

930
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:27,296
这就是你说的非常重要的事？
This is the important thing you had to tell me?

931
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,265
你得听我讲完！
You haven't heard the ending yet.

932
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:31,133
抓住他！
Grab him!

933
00:49:33,237 --> 00:49:34,837
抓住他了！
Got him!

934
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:36,339
干得好！
Well done.

935
00:49:41,245 --> 00:49:43,579
爸爸，这位是艾莲娜公主。
Dad, this is Princess Elena.

936
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:46,315
我很抱歉给你的家人带来危险，
I'm sorry for the danger I put your family in.

937
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,184
但我等一位公主把我从
But I've waited so many years

938
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:51,087
护身符里救出来已经等了太多年了，
for the one princess that could free me from the amulet,

939
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:52,989
那位公主就是苏菲亚。
and that was Sofia.

940
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:55,791
被带到你们城堡的第一天我就感觉到了。
I sensed it from the very first day she moved into your castle.

941
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:59,028
所以我在给苏菲亚挑礼物的时候，
So when I was picking out Sofia's welcome gift,

942
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:01,030
是你让护身符发光的对吗？
it was you who made the amulet glow?

943
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:03,265
没错，我需要一个足够年轻的小孩子
Yes. I needed someone young enough

944
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:06,268
来接近史瑞奇，以免她产生怀疑，
to get close to Shuriki without making her suspicious,

945
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:08,637
但她的勇敢和机智救了我。
but brave and clever enough to get me out.

946
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:10,373
所以请不要生她的气，
So you shouldn't be mad at her.

947
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,375
你应该为她感到自豪！
You should be proud.

948
00:50:12,377 --> 00:50:14,543
苏菲亚，你应该早点告诉我们的。
Sofia, you still should've told us what was going on.

949
00:50:14,545 --> 00:50:17,446
我知道，但我不想给你们添麻烦。
I know. I just wanted to keep you all out of trouble.

950
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:19,215
好吧，但我们知道得也太晚了吧！
Well, it's too late for that.

951
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:22,051
我想这次就原谅你吧！
I think a pardon may be in order just this once.

952
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:24,353
我有一个能保证你们安全的计划，
I have a plan to get you all to safety,

953
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,122
但我们得赶紧。
but we have to hurry.

954
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:28,557
我已经没有耐心了，埃斯特班。
I'm losing my patience, Esteban.

955
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,359
艾莲娜公主到底在哪里？
Where is Princess Elena?

956
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:33,229
史瑞奇，当我帮你入侵阿瓦洛的时候，
Queen Shuriki, when I helped you invade Avalor,

957
00:50:33,231 --> 00:50:36,665
你答应过我绝不会伤害我的家人。
you promised me that no one in my family would be hurt.

958
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:40,169
我也答应给你权力，看看你现在，
I also promised you power, and look at you now,

959
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:42,371
埃斯特班大臣。
Chancellor Esteban.

960
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:45,875
只是很高兴我遵守了其中一项承诺，
Just be happy I kept one of my promises,

961
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:48,744
否则你会像你阿姨和叔叔一样。
or you'll wind up like your aunt and uncle.

962
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:50,546
你要见我吗？女王陛下。
You wanted to see me, Your Grace.

963
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:54,417
在找到那两个公主之前我不想见任何人！
I don't want to see anyone until those princesses are found.

964
00:50:54,419 --> 00:50:56,419
你好哇，史瑞奇。
Hey there, Shuriki.

965
00:50:56,421 --> 00:50:58,354
好久不见。
Long time no see.

966
00:50:58,356 --> 00:51:02,391
在外面我还能忍你，但在我的宫殿里不可能！
I've put up with you buzzards outside, but not in my palace.

967
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,427
但这里很舒服，
But it's so comfy in here.

968
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:06,495
哦，这个栖息地可真不错！
Ooh, here's a nice little perch.

969
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:07,897
从我的王座上下来。
Get off my throne.

970
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:09,899
- <i>Vadisima!（咒语）</i>
- 没打中！
- Missed me!

971
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:11,600
抓住那头野兽！
Capture that beast.

972
00:51:11,602 --> 00:51:13,836
你听说女王说的了吗？快去！
You heard the queen. Move!

973
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:15,304
遵命！
Yes, sir.

974
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:23,079
好的，我来看下咒语。
Okay, let's see the spell.

975
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:26,615
哇哦！
Whoa.
<i>Tlah...cui...lolli...?</i>

976
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:28,551
哦，伙计，这简直就是绕口令！
Oh, boy, that's a tongue twister.

977
00:51:28,553 --> 00:51:29,718
马泰奥！
Mateo!

978
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,987
噢，是你们啊！
Oh, it's you.

979
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,424
哦，伊莎贝尔！
Oh, Isabel!

980
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,026
你得救他们出来，马泰奥。
You have to get them out, Mateo.

981
00:51:37,028 --> 00:51:38,594
现在。
Now.

982
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:39,895
好的。
Okay.

983
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:42,465
<i>Tlahcuilolli apartad.（咒语）</i>

984
00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:44,366
<i>Tlahcuilolli apareced.（咒语）</i>

985
00:51:44,368 --> 00:51:46,702
<i> Tlahcuilolli vivid!（咒语）</i>

986
00:51:55,146 --> 00:51:57,947
- 伊莎贝尔！ - 艾莲娜！
- Isabel! - Elena!

987
00:51:57,949 --> 00:52:00,282
我好想你。
I missed you so much.

988
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,151
让我...
Let me just...

989
00:52:02,153 --> 00:52:04,120
你安全了。
You're safe.

990
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:06,555
爷爷，奶奶！
Abuelo,abuela.

991
00:52:07,992 --> 00:52:10,926
宫殿看起来有点不一样啊！
The palace looks so different.

992
00:52:10,928 --> 00:52:13,796
- 史瑞奇呢？ - 她还在这里。
- What happened to Shuriki? - She's still here.

993
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:17,433
我就不应该让阿拉克扎把我们封在画里。
I never should've let Alacazar put us in that painting.

994
00:52:17,435 --> 00:52:18,901
呃，我们可以等一下再说这件事吗？
Uh, can we talk about this later?

995
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:20,736
我们得走了！
We have to go.

996
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,741
大家抓紧时间，骑上飞豹。
Everyone hurry. Get on a jaquin.

997
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:27,343
哇哦，公主。
Whoa, princess.

998
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:29,311
你应该告诉我一个准确数，
You should've given me a head count.

999
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:31,147
你们中有些人可能要加倍！
Some of you may have to double up.

1000
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:34,250
这些飞豹会带你的家人到你们的船上去，
These jaquins will take your family back to your ship,

1001
00:52:34,252 --> 00:52:35,751
然后我们再讨论其它事情。
and we're taking the others.

1002
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:39,788
人们从什么时候起开始骑飞豹的？
Since when do people ride jaquins?

1003
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:42,691
不要太习惯哦！
Don't get used to it.

1004
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:46,996
我不会在史瑞奇面前再次逃跑了，艾莲娜。
I'm not running away from Shuriki again, Elena.

1005
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:49,932
我们不会逃跑，奶奶，你会知道的。
We're not running away,abuela.You'll see.

1006
00:52:59,944 --> 00:53:02,011
我要留下来帮艾莲娜。
I'm going to stay and help Elena.

1007
00:53:02,013 --> 00:53:05,014
什么？要是我早知道，我才不会管那种鸟事！
What? If I knew that, I would've gotten on another bird thingy.

1008
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:06,315
我们得帮他们，罗伦！
We should help, too, Rollie.

1009
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:08,350
我正打算这么做，但要先把孩子们
I intend to, but the children

1010
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:09,885
带到船上去，那里才安全。
should return to the ship where it's safe.

1011
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:11,353
我们不会有事的，爸爸！
We'll be okay, Dad.

1012
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,189
我们不是孤军奋战，所有人都会帮我们！
We won't be alone. Everyone's coming.

1013
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:15,524
所有人是什么意思？
What do you mean, everyone?

1014
00:53:18,462 --> 00:53:21,363
大家快来，我们去城堡！
Come on. We're going to the castle.

1015
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:23,499
阿瓦洛万岁！
Viva Avalor!

1016
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:27,303


1017
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:36,045
嘿！史瑞奇！
Hey, Shuriki.

1018
00:53:36,047 --> 00:53:38,047
我在这里感觉好孤独。。
I'm getting a little lonely up here.

1019
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:40,583
你还来！
You again.
<i>Vadisima!（咒语）</i>

1020
00:53:40,585 --> 00:53:42,017
太慢了！
Too slow.

1021
00:53:42,019 --> 00:53:43,652
<i>Vadisima!（咒语）</i>

1022
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:45,421
又没打中！
Missed me again.

1023
00:53:45,423 --> 00:53:46,889
如果你想杀死我就得
You're gonna have to aim better than that

1024
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:48,390
再瞄准一点！
if you're gonna zap me.

1025
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:51,660
哦，好吧，你自找的！
Oh, I will, you pest.
<i>Vadisima!（咒语）</i>

1026
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:53,529
哦！哈哈！
Oh. Uh-huh.

1027
00:53:53,531 --> 00:53:55,064
射得好，史瑞奇！
Nice shot, Shuriki.

1028
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:57,199
知道吗？我其实是在分散你的注意力，
Well, it's been a blast distracting you,

1029
00:53:57,201 --> 00:53:59,201
- 但我要先走一步啦！ - 分散我的注意力？
- but I'm outta here. - Distracting me?

1030
00:53:59,203 --> 00:54:01,170
它到底什么意思，埃斯特班？
What is she talking about, Esteban?

1031
00:54:01,172 --> 00:54:03,005
什么？
What?

1032
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,907
那是什么声音？
What is that sound?

1033
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,377
他们来了，女王陛下！
They're coming, Your Majesty.

1034
00:54:08,379 --> 00:54:09,445
谁来了？
Who is coming?

1035
00:54:09,447 --> 00:54:10,679
所有人！
All of Avalor.

1036
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:14,250


1037
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:16,285
那是...歌声？
Is that... singing?

1038
00:54:16,287 --> 00:54:19,788


1039
00:54:25,863 --> 00:54:28,864
我们正向皇宫出发
? So we will march to the palace once more ?

1040
00:54:28,866 --> 00:54:32,268
给阿瓦洛带回自由
? To bring back the freedom of all Avalor ?

1041
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:35,537
我们一生都在等待这一天
? We've spent our whole lives waiting just for this day ?

1042
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:38,540
而且没有什么，不，是绝对没有什么
? And nothing, no, nothing ?

1043
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:42,378
能阻挡我们
? Will stand in our way ?

1044
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,914
这是我们的时刻
? This is our time ?

1045
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:49,285
我们一起，绝不失败
? Together as one, we won't fail ?

1046
00:54:49,287 --> 00:54:52,821
我们的时刻
? Our time ?

1047
00:54:52,823 --> 00:54:56,492
我们都知道这一次能成功
? This time we know we'll prevail ?

1048
00:54:56,494 --> 00:54:59,461
我们的时刻
? Our time ?

1049
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:02,598
为了家人和朋友的荣誉
? To honor our family and friends ?

1050
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,168
我们的时刻
? Our time ?

1051
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:12,574
这是我们的时刻
? This is our time ?

1052
00:55:12,576 --> 00:55:20,683
又一次
? Once again ?

1053
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:25,421
- 站住！ - 停止前进！
- Halt! - Stop right there.

1054
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:26,622
我来对付他们。
I'll take care of them.

1055
00:55:26,624 --> 00:55:28,257
打起精神，美兰达！
Brace yourself, Miranda.

1056
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:35,297
他们把大门锁了，
They locked the gate.

1057
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:36,799
我们把它攻破。
We'll have to break it down.

1058
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:39,201
或者我们飞到里面去把门打开。
Or we can fly around the other side and open it.

1059
00:55:39,203 --> 00:55:40,669
就这样！
That'll work, too.

1060
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,367
团结一致，
Stay together.

1061
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:13,635
齐心协力！
Stay strong!

1062
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:15,504
镇定，土兵！
Stand firm, men.

1063
00:56:15,506 --> 00:56:17,973
以女王的名义命令你们停下！
Stop in the name of the queen.

1064
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:19,375


1065
00:56:19,377 --> 00:56:20,642
阻止他们！
Stop them!

1066
00:56:20,644 --> 00:56:23,312
- 他们人数太多了。 - 撤退！快跑哇！
- There's just too many. - Retreat! Run!

1067
00:56:23,314 --> 00:56:24,847
我觉得我们应该马上逃走。
I think I'll just go over here now.

1068
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:27,383
懦夫！够了！
Cowards! Enough!

1069
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:28,751
<i>Obscuras!（咒语）</i>

1070
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,321


1071
00:56:34,992 --> 00:56:37,593
立刻滚出我的宫殿！
Leave my palace at once.

1072
00:56:37,595 --> 00:56:39,428
这不是你的宫殿，史瑞奇，
It's not your palace, Shuriki.

1073
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:42,564
这是我们的，你也不能阻止我们！
It's ours, and you can't stop all of us.

1074
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:44,666
不用那么麻烦，
I don't have to.

1075
00:56:44,668 --> 00:56:46,435
只要阻止你就行了！
I only need to stop you.

1076
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:49,405
埃斯特班！
Esteban!

1077
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,672
你干什么？
What are you doing?

1078
00:56:50,674 --> 00:56:52,741
艾莲娜，接住！
Elena, catch.

1079
00:56:56,514 --> 00:57:00,949
哈！你根本不会用魔法棒，小女孩！
Ha! You can't use the wand on me, girl.

1080
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:05,788
也许吧，但我想看看没了它你还有多大能耐，
Maybe so, but let's see how powerful you are without it.

1081
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:37,653
史瑞奇，你的统治结束了！
Shuriki, your reign is over.

1082
00:57:37,655 --> 00:57:39,655


1083
00:57:39,657 --> 00:57:41,990
不！
No.

1084
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:56,371
她死了，艾莲娜，我们赢了！
She's gone, Elena. We won.

1085
00:57:57,741 --> 00:58:00,275
虽然用了这么多年的时间。
After all these years.

1086
00:58:00,277 --> 00:58:03,445
向阿瓦洛王位的合法继承人致敬，
All hail the rightful heir of Avalor,

1087
00:58:03,447 --> 00:58:05,614
艾莲娜公主！
Princess Elena!

1088
00:58:05,616 --> 00:58:07,749


1089
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:09,785
等一下，现在我要接管这个王国吗？
Wait. I'm in charge of the kingdom now?

1090
00:58:09,787 --> 00:58:11,520
你是他们的领导者，
You are the eldest child.

1091
00:58:11,522 --> 00:58:13,856
王位就应当属于你！
The crown goes to you.

1092
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:14,990
真的吗？
It does?

1093
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:18,694
你会治理好这个国家的，艾莲娜。
You will be a great ruler, Elena.

1094
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:20,629
你爷爷和我都会
And you'll have your grandfather and I

1095
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:23,499
帮你，所以没什么可担心的。
to help you, so there's nothing to worry about.

1096
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:25,968
现在去给你的子民们打个招呼吧！
Now go and address your people.

1097
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:28,804
对了，向我的子民们打招呼！
Right. Address my people.

1098
00:58:28,806 --> 00:58:31,206
好的！
Okay.

1099
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:34,776
你好！嗨！
Hello. Hi.

1100
00:58:34,778 --> 00:58:37,112
你好吗？你好！
How are you? Hey there.

1101
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:40,349
谢谢你们所做的一切！
And thank you for everything.

1102
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:43,886
艾莲娜，我想我应该把这个还给你。
Elena, I guess this belongs to you.

1103
00:58:43,888 --> 00:58:46,388
苏菲亚，我希望你能留着它，
Sofia, I want you to have it,

1104
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:48,390
以感谢你为阿瓦洛所做的一切！
for all you've done for Avalor.

1105
00:58:48,392 --> 00:58:50,726
再说我觉得我这辈子在护身符里
Besides, I think I've seen enough of that amulet

1106
00:58:50,728 --> 00:58:52,794
已经看够了。
for a lifetime.

1107
00:58:52,796 --> 00:58:54,963
谢谢你，艾莲娜！
Thank you, Elena.

1108
00:59:03,474 --> 00:59:05,240
谢谢你，表哥！
Thank you, cousin.

1109
00:59:05,242 --> 00:59:07,509
有那么一会儿，我都有点认不出你了！
For a moment, I wasn't sure whose side you were on.

1110
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:10,212
我一直都站在我们这边，
I was always on our side,

1111
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:13,515
但我不能让史瑞奇破坏那幅画，
but I couldn't let Shuriki find a way to destroy that painting.

1112
00:59:13,517 --> 00:59:15,317
我的家人在里面。
Our family was in there.

1113
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:17,753
所以我帮她做事来保证
And so, I pretended to follow her

1114
00:59:17,755 --> 00:59:19,922
他们的安全。
to keep them safe.

1115
00:59:19,924 --> 00:59:22,758
我希望你能理解，艾莲娜。
I hope you understand, Elena.

1116
00:59:32,836 --> 00:59:35,337
- 艾莲娜！ - 伊莎！
- Elena! - Isa!

1117
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:11,073
你需要我的话我会随叫随到，公主，
Any time you need a ride, princess,

1118
01:00:11,075 --> 01:00:12,975
我就是你的坐骑！
I'm your jaquin.

1119
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:15,911
敲响阿瓦洛所有的钟吧！
Let every bell in Avalor ring.

1120
01:00:15,913 --> 01:00:17,779
我们自由啦！
We are free!

1121
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:20,048


1122
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:22,551
- 那感觉怎么样？ - 棒极了！
- How was that? - Great.

1123
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:32,794
于是全国各地
And all across the kingdom,

1124
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:34,930
所有的阿瓦洛人民都为此欢呼，
the people of Avalor cheered,

1125
01:00:34,932 --> 01:00:38,900
为了失去的公主回归而欢呼。
for their lost princess had finally come home.

1126
01:00:38,902 --> 01:00:42,804
于是艾莲娜公主开始了新的统治，
Thus began the reign of Princess Elena,

1127
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:45,974
阿瓦洛人民迎来了
and with it, a new age of joy and prosperity

1128
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:47,843
新时代的繁荣昌盛！
for all of Avalor.

1129
01:00:47,845 --> 01:00:49,011
真精彩！
Wonderful.

1130
01:00:49,013 --> 01:00:52,814
我得说这是一个非常幸福的结局。
I would call that a very happy ending.

1131
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:55,951
确实是，但我觉得她的故事不会就这样结束。
It is, but I don't think her story is over just yet.

1132
01:00:55,953 --> 01:00:57,986
当然不会，
Of course it isn't,

1133
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:01,023
但接下来的事情就是另一本书的故事了。
but what happens next is a tale for another book.

1134
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:12,868
感谢你所做的一切，苏菲亚。
Thank you for all you have done, Sofia.

1135
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:17,039
这是为你度假特意准备的！
And this is for the journey ahead.

1136
01:01:37,728 --> 01:01:39,061
所以我把这个带来了，
Which brings me to this.

1137
01:01:39,063 --> 01:01:40,862
我要想个办法
I need to figure out

1138
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:42,964
处理掉她的魔法棒。
what to do with the pieces of her wand.

1139
01:01:42,966 --> 01:01:45,634
好吧，你可以把它从悬崖上扔下去。
Well, you could just toss 'em off the cliff.

1140
01:01:45,636 --> 01:01:48,904
我想找个更安全的办法。
I was thinking of something a little more secure.

1141
01:01:48,906 --> 01:01:51,139
我知道你会的...
I know. You could...

1142
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:53,875
我是说，这太明显了。
No, that's too obvious.

1143
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:55,510
哼嗯...
Hmm.

1144
01:01:55,512 --> 01:01:57,646
我想到了，我们可以把它藏在金库里，
I know. We can hide them in the treasury,

1145
01:01:57,648 --> 01:02:00,882
不告诉任何人。
and not tell anyone where we put it.

1146
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:04,519
没错，这肯定是阿瓦洛最大的秘密。
Yes. It'll be the best-guarded secret in Avalor.

1147
01:02:04,521 --> 01:02:06,088
谢谢你，娜奥米！
Thanks, Naomi.

1148
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:09,691
我可是你朋友兼参议员啊！
What are friends and Grand Counselors for?

1149
01:02:09,693 --> 01:02:12,561
我们是不是该回去了？
So, should we head back down?

1150
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:14,329
你确定不用多休息一下吗？
Are you sure you don't need more rest?

1151
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:16,098
算起来你都已经57岁了！
You are 57, after all.

1152
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:18,066


1153
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:19,935
好吧，我奶奶说过，
Well, as my abuela says,

1154
01:02:19,937 --> 01:02:22,704
被困在护身符里的时间不算。
time spent in magical jewelry doesn't count.

1155
01:02:22,706 --> 01:02:23,939
那我们最好回去。
Then we better go.

1156
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:25,941
王国不会自己统治自己。
The kingdom's not gonna rule itself.

1157
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:28,110
没错！
Right.

1158
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
第一次唱歌的歌词可能翻译得不是很好

1159
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
将就着看吧！????

1160
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
不服？

1161
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
然而你还不是看完了！

1162
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
其实翻译的那4个人都是我????
