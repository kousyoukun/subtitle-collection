1
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:41,164
<i>Hi! Ouch!</i>

2
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:43,714
Hey, wait for me.

3
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:47,464
I can't hardly move
with all these creeper things.

4
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:52,412
Them other kids must have
got scattered in the dark.

5
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:55,831
We ought to go and find them.

6
00:05:15,977 --> 00:05:20,466
My auntie told me not to run
on account of my asthma.

7
00:05:20,344 --> 00:05:22,636
<i>- Asthma ?
- That's right.</i>

8
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:26,294
I was the only boy
in our school that had asthma.

9
00:05:30,055 --> 00:05:33,391
And I've been wearing specs
since I was three.

10
00:06:34,854 --> 00:06:38,262
<i>- Where's the plane ?
- The storm must have dragged it out.</i>

11
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:42,618
<i>There must have been
some kids still in it.</i>

12
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:46,602
<i>Are there any grown-ups ?</i>

13
00:06:46,565 --> 00:06:49,558
- I don't think so.
- What's your name ?

14
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:51,522
Ralph.

15
00:06:51,502 --> 00:06:53,520
I don't care what they call me,

16
00:06:53,505 --> 00:06:56,807
as long as they don't call me
what they did at school.

17
00:06:56,742 --> 00:06:58,760
What's that ?

18
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:03,800
- They used to call me ''Piggy.''
- Piggy!

19
00:07:03,717 --> 00:07:06,637
As long as you don't
tell the others.

20
00:07:10,123 --> 00:07:12,178
Daddy's a commander in the Navy.

21
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:17,590
One day when he gets leave,
he'll come and rescue us.

22
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:48,951
<i>- Aren't you coming in ?
- Ooh, it's hot.</i>

23
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,873
No. My auntie wouldn't let me--
account of my asthma.

24
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,361
<i>Sucks to your asthma.</i>

25
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:57,564
<i>You can't half swim well.</i>

26
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,809
<i>- Hey, look!
- It's a shell.</i>

27
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,649
<i>I've seen one like it before
on someone's back wall.</i>

28
00:08:24,562 --> 00:08:30,059
<i>A conch, he called it. He used
to blow it, and his mum would come.</i>

29
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:37,750
He blew from down here.

30
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:40,415
- You've done it!

31
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,218
Hey! Is anyone there ?

32
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:06,577
Hey! Hey!

33
00:09:11,777 --> 00:09:14,556
- I think we ought explore a bit.

34
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:17,471
- What's your name ?
- Percival Williams Madison...

35
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:23,331
the Vicarage, Hartcourt,
St. Anthony, telephone: Hartcourt 241 .

36
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:27,028
<i>- And what's your name ?
- George.</i>

37
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,824
- What's your name ?
- Sam and Eric.

38
00:09:31,795 --> 00:09:33,814
Sam and Eric.

39
00:09:33,798 --> 00:09:36,505
Sam and Eric.

40
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,302
Choir, halt!

41
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:45,053
Where's the man
with the trumpet ?

42
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:47,433
There's no man
with a trumpet. Only me.

43
00:10:47,406 --> 00:10:49,913
- Isn't there a man here ?
- No.

44
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,653
Then we'll have
to look after ourselves.

45
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:57,303
We're having a meeting.
Come and join us.

46
00:10:57,181 --> 00:10:59,781
- Is he all right ?

47
00:10:59,752 --> 00:11:02,042
Put him in the shade, quick!

48
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:15,941
<i>- Let him alone.
- But, Merridew.</i>

49
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:20,356
<i>He'll be all right.
Simon's always throwing a faint.</i>

50
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:23,269
<i>Now let's decide
what we're going to do.</i>

51
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:27,733
That's why Ralph made a meeting--
so as we can decide what to do.

52
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,317
We got most names.

53
00:11:30,284 --> 00:11:33,204
Those two-- they're twins.
Sam and Eric.

54
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:35,690
- I'm Sam.
- I'm Eric.

55
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,352
I'm Ralph.

56
00:11:38,588 --> 00:11:41,960
<i>- And you ?
- Douglas.</i>

57
00:11:41,893 --> 00:11:45,087
<i>- Yours ?
- Charles.</i>

58
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:47,808
And what are all your names ?

59
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:49,784
Henry.

60
00:11:50,936 --> 00:11:52,955
Maurice.

61
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:56,623
Robert.

62
00:11:59,076 --> 00:12:01,095
Wilbur.

63
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,099
Harold.

64
00:12:08,418 --> 00:12:10,437
Bill.

65
00:12:12,492 --> 00:12:14,511
Roger.

66
00:12:17,794 --> 00:12:19,813
<i>- Simon.
- I'm Jack.</i>

67
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,592
- And that boy there. He--
- You're talking too much.

68
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:27,279
- Shut up, Fatty!
- His name's not Fatty.

69
00:12:27,238 --> 00:12:29,778
- His real name's Piggy.
- Piggy!

70
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:49,966
We've got to decide
about being rescued.

71
00:12:49,928 --> 00:12:52,504
I think we ought to have
a chief to decide things.

72
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:55,350
<i>- Someone must take charge.
</i>

73
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:57,317
<i>- I ought to be chief.
- Him with the shell!</i>

74
00:12:57,301 --> 00:13:01,576
<i>- He got us together.
- I'm chief chorister and head boy.</i>

75
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:03,969
<i>- Let's have a vote.</i>

76
00:13:05,546 --> 00:13:07,659
<i>All right. We'll have a vote.</i>

77
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:11,436
<i>- Who wants Jack for chief then ?</i>

78
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:23,023
<i>- Who wants me ?
- Me!</i>

79
00:13:22,992 --> 00:13:25,355
- Me!
- Me!

80
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,349
<i>Me. Me.</i>

81
00:13:38,642 --> 00:13:40,660
<i>I'm chief, then.</i>

82
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:49,096
<i>Jack's in charge of the choir.
What do you want them to be ?</i>

83
00:13:50,353 --> 00:13:52,337
Hunters.

84
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:54,899
<i>Choir, take off your togs.</i>

85
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:03,931
Hey, what are you wearing
those funny clothes for ?

86
00:14:03,835 --> 00:14:06,198
It's our uniform.

87
00:14:15,177 --> 00:14:18,097
<i>Listen, everybody.
If this isn't an island,</i>

88
00:14:18,048 --> 00:14:20,067
we might get rescued
straightaway.

89
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,070
So we've got to decide
if it is.

90
00:14:22,056 --> 00:14:25,737
<i>Three of us will go
on an expedition to find out.</i>

91
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:30,005
I'll go and Jack.

92
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:32,743
<i>- And--
- Take me. Please.</i>

93
00:14:32,698 --> 00:14:34,882
You. You all right now ?

94
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:41,291
- I'll come.
- We don't want you. Three's enough.

95
00:14:41,272 --> 00:14:43,742
I was with him
when he found the conch.

96
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:47,115
I was with him
before anyone else was.

97
00:14:53,586 --> 00:14:58,762
- You can't come.
- You told them after what I said--

98
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:02,175
after I said I didn't want--

99
00:15:02,092 --> 00:15:04,112
What are you talking about ?

100
00:15:04,093 --> 00:15:06,633
About being called Piggy.

101
00:15:06,596 --> 00:15:11,288
I said I didn't care
as long as they didn't call me Piggy.

102
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,019
And I said not to tell.

103
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:17,096
And then you went
and said straight out--

104
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,641
- Better Piggy than Fatty.

105
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:22,425
And anyway, I'm sorry
if you feel like that.

106
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:26,417
Go back, Piggy, and take names.
That's your job. So long.

107
00:16:22,006 --> 00:16:24,024
<i>Hey, look!</i>

108
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:31,623
One, two, three.

109
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:33,355
Heave!

110
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,517
Heave!

111
00:19:01,497 --> 00:19:05,011
<i>We're on an uninhabited island.</i>

112
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:08,757
<i>We shall have
to look after ourselves.</i>

113
00:19:08,674 --> 00:19:12,605
<i>But it's a good island.
There's lots of fruit, water,</i>

114
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,952
<i>and I'm pretty sure there aren't
any dangerous animals.</i>

115
00:19:15,879 --> 00:19:18,907
<i>So things aren't so bad.</i>

116
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,869
<i>None of us are hurt.</i>

117
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:24,808
<i>There isn't any danger,</i>

118
00:19:24,755 --> 00:19:27,462
<i>and we can build shelters
and be comfortable.</i>

119
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,892
So if we're sensible--
if we do things properly--

120
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,787
if we don't lose our head--
we'll be all right.

121
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,593
- But where will we sleep ?
- We'll build shelters.

122
00:19:40,536 --> 00:19:43,635
We can have smashing fun.

123
00:19:43,574 --> 00:19:46,638
And another thing.
We can't have everybody talking at once.

124
00:19:46,578 --> 00:19:51,755
We shall have to put our hands up,
then I'll give him the conch.

125
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:54,572
<i>[Jack ]
I agree with Ralph.</i>

126
00:19:54,518 --> 00:19:56,537
We've got to have rules
and obey them.

127
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,228
After all, we're not savages.
We're English.

128
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:01,661
<i>-And the English are best at everything.</i>

129
00:20:01,626 --> 00:20:06,222
<i>So we'll have lots of rules,
and when anybody breaks them--</i>

130
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:13,436
- Piggy, Piggy, Piggy!
- Quiet!

131
00:20:13,404 --> 00:20:17,607
You're not letting Ralph
get to the most important thing.

132
00:20:18,507 --> 00:20:21,808
Who knows we're here ?

133
00:20:21,745 --> 00:20:25,189
Nobody knows we're here.

134
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:28,726
Perhaps they knew
where we were going to,

135
00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:31,015
perhaps not.

136
00:20:30,989 --> 00:20:35,157
But they don't know where we are now
'cause we never got there.

137
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:38,122
<i>We might stay here
till we die.</i>

138
00:20:59,783 --> 00:21:04,616
He wants to know what you're going to do
about the snake thing.

139
00:21:04,488 --> 00:21:07,861
Tell us about
the snake thing.

140
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:14,025
Now he says
it was a beastie.

141
00:21:13,964 --> 00:21:15,769
Beastie?

142
00:21:18,338 --> 00:21:23,134
<i>-A snake thing, ever so big. He saw it.
- When ?</i>

143
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:31,794
When he was hiding
in the jungle in the dark.

144
00:21:31,646 --> 00:21:35,363
<i>He says when the rain stopped,</i>

145
00:21:35,285 --> 00:21:39,666
it turned into one of them things
like ropes in the trees...

146
00:21:39,556 --> 00:21:41,990
and hung in the branches.

147
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,296
He says,
''Will it come back tonight ?''

148
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,892
<i>But there isn't a beastie.</i>

149
00:21:53,838 --> 00:21:56,439
I tell you,
there isn't a beast.

150
00:21:57,572 --> 00:21:59,721
Ralph's right, of course.

151
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:03,568
There isn't a snake thing, but
if there was, we'd hunt and kill it.

152
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,968
<i>There's another thing.
If a ship comes near,</i>

153
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,969
they may not notice us.

154
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:13,434
So we must make smoke on top
of the mountain. We must make a fire.

155
00:22:13,356 --> 00:22:15,054
Come on. Follow me.

156
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:18,883
- Yes!
- Let's go now!

157
00:22:20,932 --> 00:22:26,145
Just like kids--
like a crowd of kids.

158
00:22:30,907 --> 00:22:33,934
I bet it's gone teatime.

159
00:22:46,758 --> 00:22:48,776
<i>Anybody got any matches ?</i>

160
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,701
My, what a big heap
you've made!

161
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,925
Piggy's specs!
Come on!

162
00:23:09,912 --> 00:23:12,062
<i>Get out of the light!</i>

163
00:23:12,047 --> 00:23:14,861
<i>Roger, hey, Roger.
Come on over here.</i>

164
00:23:31,268 --> 00:23:33,287
My specs!

165
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:41,924
Ralph, I'll split up my choir--
my hunters, that is.

166
00:23:41,845 --> 00:23:44,100
And we'll be responsible
for keeping the fire going.

167
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:51,215
We'll make a big blaze now.
It'll last all night.

168
00:23:55,492 --> 00:23:57,332
<i>Come and give us a hand.</i>

169
00:24:51,516 --> 00:24:53,535
Attention!

170
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,348
Here comes one.

171
00:25:12,437 --> 00:25:14,657
This is a nice one.

172
00:25:25,881 --> 00:25:29,431
Just a minute.
Be careful.

173
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:34,780
Go!

174
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:37,454
No!

175
00:25:37,462 --> 00:25:39,481
It isn't gonna hit you!

176
00:25:40,363 --> 00:25:41,752
Ooh!

177
00:25:41,763 --> 00:25:44,757
Come on, come on!

178
00:27:33,244 --> 00:27:35,713
Kill! Kill!

179
00:27:39,248 --> 00:27:41,539
<i>No throwing sand!</i>

180
00:27:50,663 --> 00:27:53,655
<i>Ralph, come here! It's a plane!</i>

181
00:27:53,596 --> 00:27:55,222
A plane! A plane!

182
00:27:55,231 --> 00:27:59,719
<i>Can't you hear it ? Ralph, it's going!
Hurry up! Ralph!</i>

183
00:28:01,504 --> 00:28:05,957
I can't see no smoke.
Where is it ?

184
00:28:08,212 --> 00:28:10,575
Smoke.

185
00:28:10,548 --> 00:28:13,849
Piggy's glasses!
If the fire's out, we'll need them!

186
00:28:33,938 --> 00:28:38,069
Stop! Come back!
Come back!

187
00:28:37,974 --> 00:28:42,249
Come back! Come back!

188
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,739
They've let
the bloody fire out!

189
00:29:09,605 --> 00:29:13,987
<i>Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!</i>

190
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:15,895
<i>Hey, Ralph!</i>

191
00:29:17,981 --> 00:29:20,724
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!

192
00:29:20,684 --> 00:29:23,048
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!

193
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:26,321
<i>Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!</i>

194
00:29:26,255 --> 00:29:29,734
<i>Bash her in! Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!</i>

195
00:29:29,657 --> 00:29:32,365
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

196
00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:36,260
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in! Kill the pig!

197
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:38,708
Slit her throat!
Bash her in! Kill the pig!

198
00:29:38,668 --> 00:29:42,836
Slit her throat! Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!

199
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,759
<i>Bash her in!
Kill the pig!</i>

200
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,341
<i>Look. We killed a pig!
We stole up on it!</i>

201
00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:49,326
You let the fire out.

202
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:53,713
We can light it up again.

203
00:30:01,223 --> 00:30:03,241
You should have been
with us, Ralph.

204
00:30:03,225 --> 00:30:05,554
There was lots of blood!
You should have seen it.

205
00:30:05,527 --> 00:30:09,730
There was a plane.
There was a plane!

206
00:30:11,068 --> 00:30:14,856
They might have seen us.
We might have gone home!

207
00:30:26,418 --> 00:30:29,301
<i>You and your blood, Jack Merridew!</i>

208
00:30:29,251 --> 00:30:33,384
You and your hunting!
We might have gone home!

209
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,307
We needed meat.

210
00:30:38,994 --> 00:30:41,464
<i>You didn't
ought to have let the fire go out!</i>

211
00:30:45,602 --> 00:30:48,524
<i>- My specs!</i>

212
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:52,710
Here. Here they are.

213
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:15,079
Just you wait!

214
00:31:15,064 --> 00:31:18,506
That was a dirty trick.

215
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:21,534
All right, all right.
I'm sorry!

216
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,283
About the fire, I mean.

217
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:28,728
There. I apologize.

218
00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:32,898
Light the fire, then.

219
00:31:33,347 --> 00:31:35,923
Choir!

220
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:43,166
Piggy.

221
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,034
No, Ralph, don't! Please!

222
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,046
I'll bring them back.

223
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,129
<i>Will it swell up his legs ?</i>

224
00:32:04,111 --> 00:32:06,130
<i>- Give me a leg.</i>

225
00:32:07,286 --> 00:32:10,314
<i>- Give it to me.
- Give me a piece, please.</i>

226
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,035
Aren't I havin' none ?

227
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:03,189
You didn't hunt.

228
00:33:03,173 --> 00:33:07,305
No more did Ralph.
No more did Simon.

229
00:33:12,982 --> 00:33:15,488
Eat, damn you!

230
00:33:29,664 --> 00:33:34,010
- Kill the pig!
- Oink, oink, oink.

231
00:33:33,901 --> 00:33:37,416
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

232
00:33:37,342 --> 00:33:40,191
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

233
00:33:40,141 --> 00:33:43,099
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

234
00:33:43,045 --> 00:33:45,965
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

235
00:33:45,914 --> 00:33:48,586
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

236
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,570
<i>Kill the pig!
Slit her throat!</i>

237
00:33:50,552 --> 00:33:52,571
Quiet!

238
00:33:52,557 --> 00:33:56,594
Get down on the beach.
We're calling an assembly.

239
00:34:08,301 --> 00:34:11,746
<i>Things are beginning to break up.</i>

240
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,996
<i>I don't know why.</i>

241
00:34:15,946 --> 00:34:18,201
<i>It all began well.</i>

242
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:21,900
<i>Then people started forgetting
what really matters.</i>

243
00:34:25,053 --> 00:34:29,684
The most important thing for all
of us is getting rescued.

244
00:34:32,426 --> 00:34:36,035
<i>So now let's discuss who does what,
and when we have decided,</i>

245
00:34:38,434 --> 00:34:41,427
we can start again...

246
00:34:41,368 --> 00:34:44,491
and be careful about things
like the fire.

247
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:49,129
<i>All right, so the fire went out.</i>

248
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:51,480
<i>But we're hunters.
We got you meat.</i>

249
00:34:51,447 --> 00:34:53,774
<i>And if there is a beast,</i>

250
00:34:53,749 --> 00:34:56,706
it's my hunters who
will protect you from it.

251
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:12,253
<i>What's your name?</i>

252
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:16,439
<i>What's your name? What's your name?</i>

253
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:18,417
What's your name ?

254
00:35:21,477 --> 00:35:23,497
Quiet! Quiet!

255
00:35:25,649 --> 00:35:28,712
What's your name ?

256
00:35:28,648 --> 00:35:32,543
Percival Williams Madison,
the Vicarage,

257
00:35:32,455 --> 00:35:35,304
Hartcourt, St. Anthony.

258
00:35:35,256 --> 00:35:39,080
Telephone--

259
00:35:38,996 --> 00:35:42,546
Telephone--

260
00:35:42,465 --> 00:35:45,528
<i>- Tele--</i>

261
00:36:31,214 --> 00:36:33,233
<i>What did he say ?</i>

262
00:36:33,215 --> 00:36:36,517
<i>He says there's a beast.</i>

263
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:39,301
<i>It comes out of the sea.</i>

264
00:37:00,209 --> 00:37:05,601
My daddy said they haven't found
all the animals in the sea.

265
00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:08,370
My daddy says
there are animals--

266
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:10,392
What do you call them ?

267
00:37:10,387 --> 00:37:13,830
They make ink
and are hundreds of feet long...

268
00:37:13,754 --> 00:37:15,809
and eat whales whole.

269
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:19,270
<i>A squid can't come out of the water.</i>

270
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:37,452
Maybe he means
it's some sort of ghost.

271
00:37:37,412 --> 00:37:40,999
<i>Maybe that's
what the beast is, a ghost.</i>

272
00:37:47,624 --> 00:37:51,899
I don't believe
in no ghosts. Ever.

273
00:37:51,793 --> 00:37:55,379
<i>- Who cares what you believe, Fatty ?</i>

274
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,453
Maybe there is a beast.

275
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:05,259
<i>Hear him. He's got the conch.</i>

276
00:38:09,477 --> 00:38:12,076
What I mean is,

277
00:38:12,051 --> 00:38:15,352
maybe it's only us.

278
00:38:15,285 --> 00:38:17,304
<i>Nuts!</i>

279
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:27,890
We should have left all this
till daylight.

280
00:38:27,796 --> 00:38:29,815
We're tired.

281
00:38:31,665 --> 00:38:36,605
We'll have a vote--
on ghosts, I mean--

282
00:38:36,474 --> 00:38:39,145
and then go back
to the shelters.

283
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,550
Who thinks there
may be ghosts ?

284
00:39:03,365 --> 00:39:07,223
<i>- I see.
- I didn't vote for no ghosts.</i>

285
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:09,287
<i>Remember that, all of you.</i>

286
00:39:09,272 --> 00:39:11,326
<i>You shut up, you fat slug!</i>

287
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:13,361
I got the conch!

288
00:39:13,341 --> 00:39:15,561
<i>Oh, Jack, let him speak.
He's got the conch.</i>

289
00:39:15,546 --> 00:39:18,430
And you shut up. Who are you,
telling people what to do ?

290
00:39:18,378 --> 00:39:21,893
- You can't hunt. You can't sing.
- I'm chief. I was chosen.

291
00:39:21,813 --> 00:39:24,699
Why should choosing make any difference,
telling people what to do ?

292
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:28,513
- Piggy's got the conch.
- Favor Piggy as you always do.

293
00:39:28,424 --> 00:39:30,609
-Jack!
-Jack! Jack!

294
00:39:30,594 --> 00:39:33,479
- You're breaking the rules!
- Who cares ?

295
00:39:33,428 --> 00:39:35,862
Because the rules are
the only thing we've got.

296
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:38,194
Bullocks to the rules!
We're strong. We hunt.

297
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:40,457
If there's a beast,
we'll hunt it down!

298
00:39:49,344 --> 00:39:53,655
What's grown-ups going
to say ? Look at 'em!

299
00:39:54,949 --> 00:39:59,854
I think I ought to
give up being chief.

300
00:40:01,058 --> 00:40:05,654
You can't, Ralph. Not now.

301
00:40:05,526 --> 00:40:09,874
Blow the conch.
You've got to be tough.

302
00:40:09,766 --> 00:40:12,793
Make them do what you want.

303
00:40:16,605 --> 00:40:18,660
If I blow the conch,

304
00:40:18,642 --> 00:40:21,242
and they don't come back,

305
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,431
then we've had it.

306
00:40:36,991 --> 00:40:40,540
Are there ghosts, Piggy ?
Or beasts ?

307
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,930
Of course there aren't.

308
00:40:42,897 --> 00:40:46,507
- Why not ?
- Because things wouldn't make sense.

309
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:54,059
Houses and streets...
and TV.

310
00:40:53,873 --> 00:40:55,892
They wouldn't work.

311
00:40:57,578 --> 00:41:03,005
But suppose they wouldn't make
sense, not here on this island.

312
00:41:03,852 --> 00:41:08,020
Supposing things
are watching us...

313
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,939
and waiting.

314
00:41:11,527 --> 00:41:13,546
<i>Go on being chief, Ralph.</i>

315
00:41:13,529 --> 00:41:15,607
<i>Who's there ?</i>

316
00:41:15,597 --> 00:41:17,616
Me, Simon.

317
00:41:21,102 --> 00:41:23,881
<i>I wish my auntie were here.</i>

318
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:26,545
Oh, what's the use ?

319
00:41:27,676 --> 00:41:29,967
<i>Grown-ups know things.</i>

320
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:33,044
<i>They ain't afraid
of the dark.</i>

321
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,174
They'd meet and have tea
and discuss.

322
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:39,217
Then things would be
all right.

323
00:42:44,246 --> 00:42:45,220
<i>Sam.</i>

324
00:42:45,246 --> 00:42:47,266
<i>What's the matter?</i>

325
00:42:47,248 --> 00:42:49,266
Shh.

326
00:43:13,407 --> 00:43:17,267
<i>- It was furry.
- There was something moving...</i>

327
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:20,336
<i>behind his head-- wings.</i>

328
00:43:20,282 --> 00:43:22,882
<i>It sort of sat up.</i>

329
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:27,576
<i>It had eyes, teeth, claws.</i>

330
00:43:27,457 --> 00:43:32,468
<i>We ran as fast as we could,
bashed into things.</i>

331
00:43:32,325 --> 00:43:34,474
<i>The beast followed us.</i>

332
00:43:34,464 --> 00:43:36,790
<i>Then he caught me.</i>

333
00:43:37,598 --> 00:43:40,936
You're not pulling our legs,
are you ?

334
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,174
- We'll hunt it. Who'll come ?
- Me! Me!

335
00:43:46,109 --> 00:43:50,111
But those sticks, they're made of wood.
Don't be so silly.

336
00:43:50,012 --> 00:43:50,985
Frightened ?

337
00:43:51,013 --> 00:43:53,031
Of course I am.
Who wouldn't be ?

338
00:43:53,013 --> 00:43:54,189
Come on. Let's go.

339
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,471
<i>Who'll mind the little ones ?</i>

340
00:43:56,451 --> 00:44:00,095
- Piggy will.
- Right. Keep Piggy out of danger.

341
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,040
Haven't you got any sense ?

342
00:44:02,023 --> 00:44:05,086
How can Piggy help
with only one eye ?

343
00:44:07,361 --> 00:44:11,494
Jack, is there anywhere on this
island where we haven't been ?

344
00:44:11,397 --> 00:44:13,416
There's only--
Of course!

345
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:16,073
The tail end part,
where the rocks pile up.

346
00:45:04,385 --> 00:45:07,093
I'm chief.
I'll go in alone.

347
00:45:07,053 --> 00:45:10,117
The rest of you
wait here and hide.

348
00:45:15,528 --> 00:45:17,784
Do you think--

349
00:45:17,764 --> 00:45:21,029
I've been all over.
It must be here.

350
00:45:27,873 --> 00:45:32,042
I... don't believe
in the beast.

351
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,667
I suppose not.

352
00:46:44,585 --> 00:46:46,639
Couldn't let you do it
on your own.

353
00:47:11,978 --> 00:47:13,997
What a place for a fort!

354
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:24,809
The beast isn't here.

355
00:47:24,792 --> 00:47:28,960
-Let's get the others and go to the top.
-Boys!

356
00:47:36,135 --> 00:47:40,969
Now, this story is about
the place where I live,

357
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:43,416
called Camberley.

358
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:46,890
Now, Camberley is
quite an old place,

359
00:47:46,816 --> 00:47:50,640
but it hasn't been called
Camberley all the time.

360
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:54,753
It used to be called
Cambridgetown.

361
00:47:54,657 --> 00:47:58,515
And they used to get mixed up
with the letters...

362
00:47:58,426 --> 00:48:02,914
between Cambridge
or Cambridgetown.

363
00:48:02,794 --> 00:48:07,071
So letters that were to a person
in Cambridgetown...

364
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:11,136
used to go to a person
in Cambridge.

365
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,172
So they got a bit mixed up.
So they thought they'd change...

366
00:48:15,077 --> 00:48:17,928
the name at the post office,
because it was a post office...

367
00:48:17,878 --> 00:48:21,880
that had all the trouble
of sorting the letters.

368
00:48:21,783 --> 00:48:26,901
And they thought they'd leave
the ''cam'' from Cambridgetown,

369
00:48:26,754 --> 00:48:27,895
and they--

370
00:48:27,922 --> 00:48:29,477
''ber'' is a river,

371
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:32,339
and there are a lot of rivers
around there.

372
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:40,153
''Camber.'' And then ''ley,'' because often
the towns near there ended with ''ley.''

373
00:48:39,901 --> 00:48:42,157
Their names ended
with ''ley.''

374
00:48:42,136 --> 00:48:45,959
So they called it
Cam-ber-ley. Camberley.

375
00:48:45,873 --> 00:48:48,093
And that's the true story
of Camberley.

376
00:49:00,055 --> 00:49:02,170
I don't think we should leave
Piggy with the little ones.

377
00:49:02,158 --> 00:49:03,713
Not all night.

378
00:49:03,725 --> 00:49:07,834
We mustn't let anything
happen to Piggy, must we ?

379
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:13,370
I think someone should go back and tell
them we won't be back till after dark.

380
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:17,077
I'll go.
I don't mind.

381
00:49:17,036 --> 00:49:19,114
Honestly.

382
00:49:46,131 --> 00:49:49,160
We'll go to the beach.

383
00:49:49,105 --> 00:49:51,124
We can go to the top tomorrow.

384
00:49:51,107 --> 00:49:53,505
If you're frightened, of course.

385
00:49:53,475 --> 00:49:55,910
All right, then.
Who wants to go now ?

386
00:49:57,511 --> 00:49:59,458
You see ?

387
00:49:59,449 --> 00:50:02,369
I'm going to climb the mountain
to look for the beast now.

388
00:50:02,316 --> 00:50:04,821
- Coming ?
- I don't mind.

389
00:50:04,784 --> 00:50:06,935
If you don't mind, of course.

390
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,309
Not at all!

391
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,351
I think it's silly
only two of us go.

392
00:50:14,292 --> 00:50:18,983
If we meet anything
on the other side, two won't be enough.

393
00:50:24,405 --> 00:50:27,599
All right.
Come along, Roger.

394
00:50:43,892 --> 00:50:47,121
If you don't want to go on,
I'll go myself.

395
00:50:47,061 --> 00:50:50,707
Go on, then.
We'll wait here.

396
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,825
Shut up.

397
00:51:10,183 --> 00:51:12,546
I saw a thing on top.

398
00:51:12,522 --> 00:51:16,132
There was a noise too.
Kind of...

399
00:51:40,647 --> 00:51:43,711
<i>Keep close to the ground.</i>

400
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:53,492
<i>Over there, capping the rock.</i>

401
00:52:27,961 --> 00:52:30,430
First, you know now
we've seen the beast.

402
00:52:31,833 --> 00:52:35,419
<i>We crawled up.
We were only a few feet away.</i>

403
00:52:35,337 --> 00:52:37,807
The beast sat up
and looked at us.

404
00:52:37,771 --> 00:52:42,403
I don't think we could fight a thing
that size. Honestly, you know.

405
00:52:42,277 --> 00:52:46,384
We're talk.
We couldn't fight a tiger.

406
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,212
We'd hide.
Even Jack would hide.

407
00:52:50,117 --> 00:52:53,346
- What about my hunters ?
- Boys armed with sticks ?

408
00:52:53,286 --> 00:52:55,091
All right, then.

409
00:52:56,991 --> 00:53:00,709
He's not a hunter.
He'd never have got us meat.

410
00:53:00,627 --> 00:53:04,558
He's just giving orders,
expects people to obey for nothing.

411
00:53:04,462 --> 00:53:07,383
<i>He's like Piggy.
He says things like Piggy.</i>

412
00:53:07,334 --> 00:53:09,388
<i>He's not a proper chief.
He's a coward.</i>

413
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:12,469
On top, when Roger and me went on,
he stayed back.

414
00:53:12,405 --> 00:53:14,697
- I went too.
- After.

415
00:53:14,673 --> 00:53:18,223
I went on too, then I went away.
So did you.

416
00:53:18,145 --> 00:53:20,687
Call me a coward then.
All this talk.

417
00:53:20,648 --> 00:53:22,977
- All this talk, talk, talk.
- Right.

418
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:26,015
I'm not gonna be
part of Ralph's lot.

419
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:30,441
I'm going off by myself to the rocks
to hunt and have feasts and have fun.

420
00:53:30,323 --> 00:53:33,387
Anyone who wants
can come too.

421
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,314
Jack!

422
00:54:07,892 --> 00:54:11,051
<i>I said we could do
without a certain person.</i>

423
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:13,849
<i>Now I think
we've got to decide.</i>

424
00:54:13,801 --> 00:54:16,307
<i>We can do without Jack Merridew.</i>

425
00:54:16,269 --> 00:54:19,571
<i>There's others besides him
on this island.</i>

426
00:54:19,508 --> 00:54:22,144
<i>But now we've really
got a beast--</i>

427
00:54:22,109 --> 00:54:24,922
<i>though I can hardly
believe it--</i>

428
00:54:24,879 --> 00:54:28,181
<i>we'll need to stay close
to the platform.</i>

429
00:54:30,786 --> 00:54:33,778
I've been talking, Ralph.

430
00:54:33,718 --> 00:54:35,036
What ?

431
00:54:35,054 --> 00:54:37,727
We've got no fire
on the mountain,

432
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:41,026
but what's wrong
with a fire down here ?

433
00:54:40,962 --> 00:54:46,115
That's a good idea. We can build it
right here between the shelters.

434
00:54:45,966 --> 00:54:49,446
I think we ought
to climb the mountain.

435
00:54:49,368 --> 00:54:52,432
<i>What's the use ?</i>

436
00:54:57,611 --> 00:55:00,080
What else is there to do ?

437
00:55:56,136 --> 00:56:00,767
And put some dry leaves on.
Make sure they're dry.

438
00:56:03,043 --> 00:56:06,343
<i>If they're wet,
it won't burn properly.</i>

439
00:56:39,544 --> 00:56:41,563
Come on.

440
00:57:23,556 --> 00:57:25,575
Come on.

441
00:57:53,153 --> 00:57:55,171
Now!

442
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:44,096
Right up the ass.

443
00:59:01,891 --> 00:59:04,955
<i>Sharpen a stick at both ends.</i>

444
00:59:32,019 --> 00:59:34,834
<i>This head is for the beast.</i>

445
00:59:34,787 --> 00:59:37,114
<i>It's a gift.</i>

446
00:59:44,529 --> 00:59:49,161
Can't they see ?
Don't they understand ?

447
00:59:51,203 --> 00:59:55,027
Unless we keep the smoke burning,
we'll die.

448
00:59:58,346 --> 01:00:01,089
What's wrong, Piggy ?

449
01:00:02,514 --> 01:00:05,815
Why are things going
wrong like they are ?

450
01:00:07,417 --> 01:00:09,746
I don't know, Ralph.

451
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:05,534
Looks like we're going to have
a lot of rain, all right.

452
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:08,107
What about the fire ?

453
01:02:22,553 --> 01:02:25,023
<i>Hey, come back!</i>

454
01:02:27,825 --> 01:02:30,046
We wouldn't go back to you--

455
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:55,138
<i>Wee-wah-wo-wee.</i>

456
01:02:55,122 --> 01:02:59,230
<i>Wee-wah-wo-wee.
Wee-wah-wo-wee.</i>

457
01:03:49,808 --> 01:03:53,252
Take 'em some food.

458
01:04:00,486 --> 01:04:02,921
<i>Bananas!</i>

459
01:04:06,223 --> 01:04:08,302
<i>Wee-wah-woo-wo!</i>

460
01:04:08,293 --> 01:04:11,701
<i>Wee-wah-woo-wo!
Wee-wah-woo-wo!</i>

461
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:20,414
Who'll join my tribe ?

462
01:04:24,411 --> 01:04:27,189
Jack. I'll join your tribe,Jack.

463
01:04:31,082 --> 01:04:34,039
- Who'll join my tribe ?
- I will.

464
01:04:35,421 --> 01:04:40,147
I gave you food, and my hunters
will protect you from the beast.

465
01:04:42,027 --> 01:04:45,400
- Who'll join my tribe ?
- I will,Jack.

466
01:04:45,331 --> 01:04:50,057
I'm chief. And what about the fire ?
I've got the conch!

467
01:04:49,935 --> 01:04:53,522
You haven't got it with you.
You left it behind.

468
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:56,993
See ? Clever.

469
01:04:58,976 --> 01:05:01,375
Anyway, the conch doesn't count
on this end of the island.

470
01:05:01,346 --> 01:05:04,575
The conch counts here
and all over the island.

471
01:05:06,856 --> 01:05:09,075
<i>Who'll join my tribe ?</i>

472
01:05:09,057 --> 01:05:11,420
- Me, me!
- I will!

473
01:05:11,391 --> 01:05:14,063
- Let's join Jack's tribe!
- Yeah!

474
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:19,067
Come away.
There's going to be trouble.

475
01:07:06,071 --> 01:07:08,326
Kill the beast!

476
01:07:08,304 --> 01:07:11,333
<i>Kill the beast!
Kill the pig!</i>

477
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:15,030
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

478
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:18,107
Kill the beast!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

479
01:07:18,048 --> 01:07:21,385
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

480
01:07:21,319 --> 01:07:24,584
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

481
01:07:24,524 --> 01:07:28,727
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

482
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:43,784
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

483
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:46,868
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

484
01:07:46,811 --> 01:07:49,697
Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!

485
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:52,152
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

486
01:07:52,118 --> 01:07:54,694
Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!

487
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:57,124
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

488
01:07:57,087 --> 01:07:59,556
Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!

489
01:07:59,522 --> 01:08:01,992
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

490
01:08:01,962 --> 01:08:04,040
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat!

491
01:08:06,266 --> 01:08:08,865
<i>Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!</i>

492
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:11,411
<i>Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!</i>

493
01:08:11,368 --> 01:08:14,490
<i>Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!</i>

494
01:08:14,438 --> 01:08:19,271
Look! The beast!

495
01:08:53,478 --> 01:08:55,533
<i>Kill! Kill!</i>

496
01:08:55,515 --> 01:08:57,913
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

497
01:11:09,016 --> 01:11:12,531
Piggy, are you
the only one left ?

498
01:11:12,453 --> 01:11:15,028
<i>There are some little ones.</i>

499
01:11:14,986 --> 01:11:18,085
They don't count.
No big ones ?

500
01:11:19,225 --> 01:11:23,192
<i>Oh, Sam and Eric.
They're collecting wood.</i>

501
01:11:23,095 --> 01:11:26,848
<i>- Nobody else ?
- Not that I know of.</i>

502
01:11:42,846 --> 01:11:44,865
Piggy.

503
01:11:47,485 --> 01:11:49,706
- Piggy.
- Huh ?

504
01:11:49,686 --> 01:11:51,977
That was murder.

505
01:11:51,957 --> 01:11:56,719
You stop it! What good are you
doing talking like that ?

506
01:11:58,428 --> 01:12:02,561
It was dark!
There was that bloody dance!

507
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:06,365
There was thunder
and lightning and rain!

508
01:12:06,272 --> 01:12:08,635
We were scared!

509
01:12:08,605 --> 01:12:13,022
It wasn't...
what you said.

510
01:12:12,913 --> 01:12:15,348
Oh, Piggy!

511
01:12:16,313 --> 01:12:19,471
It was an accident.

512
01:12:25,624 --> 01:12:27,773
He was batty.

513
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,239
He asked for it.
It was an accident.

514
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,507
Oh, God,
I want to go home.

515
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:40,275
Ow!

516
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:43,682
<i>Ow! Ow!</i>

517
01:12:46,643 --> 01:12:48,757
<i>Take him away!</i>

518
01:13:03,428 --> 01:13:05,613
Tomorrow, I'll hunt again.

519
01:13:06,899 --> 01:13:09,748
Then we'll leave another head
for the beast.

520
01:13:17,577 --> 01:13:21,055
Some of you will stay
and defend the gate.

521
01:13:22,113 --> 01:13:25,105
The beast may try
and come in.

522
01:13:30,956 --> 01:13:33,141
Remember how he crawled ?

523
01:13:33,124 --> 01:13:36,354
<i>He came disguised.</i>

524
01:13:36,294 --> 01:13:39,358
<i>The beast may try and come,</i>

525
01:13:39,296 --> 01:13:42,525
<i>even though we gave him
the head of our kill to eat.</i>

526
01:13:42,467 --> 01:13:44,794
<i>So watch and be careful.</i>

527
01:13:48,241 --> 01:13:50,948
But didn't we--
Didn't we--

528
01:13:52,709 --> 01:13:55,867
<i>No. How could we kill it ?</i>

529
01:14:00,752 --> 01:14:04,860
He told us.
The beast was disguised.

530
01:14:06,559 --> 01:14:10,835
Tomorrow, when we get meat,
we'll have a feast.

531
01:14:12,931 --> 01:14:15,224
- Chief?
- Yes, Bill ?

532
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,264
<i>What'll we use
to light the fire ?</i>

533
01:14:18,202 --> 01:14:21,812
We'll get fire
from the others.

534
01:14:23,641 --> 01:14:25,720
We've got to get
out of this.

535
01:14:25,709 --> 01:14:27,728
What do you mean ?

536
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:30,562
Get rescued.

537
01:14:30,515 --> 01:14:33,056
I mean it.

538
01:14:33,017 --> 01:14:36,983
If we don't get out of here soon,
we'll be barmy.

539
01:14:36,887 --> 01:14:39,915
- Around the bend.
- Crackers.

540
01:14:48,301 --> 01:14:51,423
Have you written a letter
to your auntie lately ?

541
01:14:51,369 --> 01:14:53,697
I don't know
where she is now,

542
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:57,743
and I haven't got
an envelope or a stamp,

543
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:01,154
and there isn't
a pillar box or a postman.

544
01:15:03,148 --> 01:15:06,033
I haven't said
anything very funny.

545
01:15:10,155 --> 01:15:16,247
<i>Piggy-y-y-y!</i>

546
01:15:16,061 --> 01:15:18,245
<i>Piggy!</i>

547
01:15:20,131 --> 01:15:22,531
Don't make a sound.

548
01:15:22,499 --> 01:15:25,099
<i>We're going
to get you, Piggy.</i>

549
01:15:27,070 --> 01:15:29,397
<i>Piggy ?</i>

550
01:15:29,376 --> 01:15:32,476
<i>Where are you, Piggy ?</i>

551
01:15:32,412 --> 01:15:35,784
<i>- We've come to get you.</i>

552
01:15:46,022 --> 01:15:49,573
Ow! Ow! Ow!

553
01:16:03,907 --> 01:16:06,614
<i>Piggy, you've changed!</i>

554
01:16:06,576 --> 01:16:09,178
Piggy!

555
01:17:20,318 --> 01:17:23,832
I just take the conch
to say this.

556
01:17:23,756 --> 01:17:27,438
I can't see
without my glasses,

557
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:30,387
<i>and I got to get them back.</i>

558
01:17:30,327 --> 01:17:33,320
<i>What are we going to do ?</i>

559
01:17:54,919 --> 01:17:57,104
Hey! Who goes there ?

560
01:17:57,087 --> 01:18:01,089
Stop being silly!
You can see who I am!

561
01:18:16,574 --> 01:18:19,115
I'm calling an assembly!

562
01:18:19,076 --> 01:18:21,510
<i>Boo! Boo!</i>

563
01:18:29,855 --> 01:18:32,635
Don't leave me, Ralph!

564
01:18:35,325 --> 01:18:38,519
You sit down
and wait for me. Here.

565
01:18:44,901 --> 01:18:47,442
What do you want ?

566
01:18:47,405 --> 01:18:52,001
<i>Go away, Ralph!
You keep to your end.</i>

567
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:56,709
This is my end and my tribe.
You have to leave me alone.

568
01:18:56,580 --> 01:19:00,712
<i>You took Piggy's specs.
You've got to give them back.</i>

569
01:19:00,619 --> 01:19:03,683
Got to ? Who says ?

570
01:19:03,621 --> 01:19:06,814
I say!
That was a dirty trick.

571
01:19:06,757 --> 01:19:09,820
We would have given you fire
if you asked for it.

572
01:19:09,761 --> 01:19:12,789
But you didn't.
You came sneaking up like a thief.

573
01:19:12,728 --> 01:19:15,792
- Say that again!
- Thief! Thief!

574
01:19:15,733 --> 01:19:17,952
Who's a thief?

575
01:19:17,935 --> 01:19:19,954
You are!

576
01:19:21,107 --> 01:19:25,488
Ralph!
Remember what we came for.

577
01:19:25,377 --> 01:19:28,262
The fire. My specs.

578
01:19:28,211 --> 01:19:31,441
Don't you see ? There may be
a ship out there or a plane!

579
01:19:39,124 --> 01:19:41,832
- Grab 'em!
-Jack!

580
01:19:41,792 --> 01:19:44,226
<i>Tie 'em up!</i>

581
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:49,528
See ?
They do what I want.

582
01:19:49,469 --> 01:19:53,187
You're a beast and a swine
and a bloody, bloody thief!

583
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,781
<i>Boo! Boo!</i>

584
01:19:58,743 --> 01:20:01,556
<i>Go, Jack! Go!</i>

585
01:20:22,099 --> 01:20:24,700
<i>Let me speak!</i>

586
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:27,210
I've got the conch!

587
01:20:42,956 --> 01:20:45,556
Which is it better to be ?

588
01:20:45,524 --> 01:20:50,013
A pack of panting savages
like you are...

589
01:20:51,027 --> 01:20:53,391
or sensible like Ralph is ?

590
01:20:53,365 --> 01:20:56,738
- Which is better?

591
01:20:56,665 --> 01:21:01,118
<i>To have rules and agree,
or to hunt and kill?</i>
