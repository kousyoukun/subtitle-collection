如果三个点被采取
在三角形的两边
if three points are taken
in two sides of a triangle...

3
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,215
第三个边减少
或者所有的三个边减少...
and the third side produced
are in all three sides produced...

4
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,552
以便提供三个选择段被采取合理
so that the product of the three
alternate segments taken in order -

5
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,783
# Kyrie, kyrie #

6
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,952
# Eleison #

7
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:37,305
# Kyrie eleison #

8
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:44,771
# Eleison ##

9
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,824
嘿！嗷！
Hi! Ouch!

10
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,369
嘿！等一等！
Hey, wait for me.

11
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:50,122
这么些藤蔓我真没办法弄掉
I can't hardly move
with all these creeper things.

12
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,044
其他的小孩一定已经在黑暗中被冲散了
Them other kids must have
got scattered in the dark.

13
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,964
我们必须去找到他们
We ought to go and find them.

14
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:23,030
我姨妈叫我别跑，因为我有气喘病
My auntie told me not to run
on account of my asthma.

15
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,324
- 气喘病？
- 对呀
- Asthma?
- That's right.

16
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:28,911
在我们学校就我一个男孩得气喘病
I was the only boy
in our school that had asthma.

17
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,002
我还从三岁起就一直带着眼镜
And I've been wearing specs
since I was three.

18
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,773
- 飞机在哪里？
- 暴风雨把飞机拖到海里去了
- Where's the plane?
- The storm must have dragged it out to sea.

19
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,568
机舱里准保还有些小孩呢
There must have been some kids still in it.

20
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,572
到底还有没有大人呢？
Are there any grown-ups?

21
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,492
- 我认为没有
- 你叫什么名字？
- I don't think so.
- What's your name?

22
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,494
拉尔夫
Ralph.

23
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,496
我不在乎他们叫我啥名字
I don't care what they call me...

24
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,248
只要他们别用在学校时常叫我的那个绰号
as long as they don't call me
what they did at school.

25
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,833
那个什么绰号？
What's that?

26
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,714
- 他们常叫我“猪崽子”
- 猪崽子！
- They used to call me "Piggy."
- Piggy!

27
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:06,592
只要你不告诉别人
As long as you don't tell the others.

28
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,223
爸爸是个海军军官
Daddy's a commander in the navy.

29
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,561
他一休假就会来救咱们的
One day, when he gets leave,
he'll come and rescue us.

30
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,798
- 你不打算游泳吗？
- 噢, 好热
- Aren't you coming in?
- Ooh, it's hot.

31
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,636
不，我姨妈不让我这么干，因为我的气喘病
No. My auntie wouldn't let me -
account of my asthma.

32
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,429
去你的气喘病
Sucks to your asthma!

33
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,518
你游得不行啊
You can't half swim well.

34
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,791
- 嘿，看
- 一个贝壳
- Hey, look.
- It's a shell.

35
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:24,753
我以前在人家的后屋墙上见过像这样一个
I've seen one like it before
on someone's back wall.

36
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:29,967
那人叫它海螺。他常吹，一吹他妈妈就来了
A conch, he called it. He used to blow it,
and then his mum would come.

37
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,725
他从下面这儿使劲吹
He blew from down here.

38
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,394
你做到了
You've done it!

39
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,198
嘿！那里有人吗？
Hey! Is anyone there?

40
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,545
嘿！嘿！
Hey! Hey!

41
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,511
我认为我们应该去探一下险
I think we ought to go and explore a bit.

42
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,598
- 你叫什么名字？

60
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,806
合唱队, 停!
Choir, halt!

61
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,810
带喇叭的大人在哪儿？
Where's the man with the trumpet?

62
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,438
这儿没有带喇叭的大人，只有我
There's no man with a trumpet.
Only me.

63
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,940
- 一个大人也没有吗？
- 没有
- Isn't there a man here?
- No.

64
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,609
那么我们只好自己料理自己的事情了
Then we'll have to look after ourselves.

65
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,738
我们在开会，过来参加吧
We're having a meeting.
Come and join us.

66
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,907
他还行吗？
Is he all right?

67
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,036
把他抬到阴凉的地方，快！
Take him out of the sun.
Put him in the shade, quick!

68
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,883
- 好吧，让他一个人待着
- 但是，梅瑞狄
- All right. Let him alone.
- But, Merridew -

69
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,262
他很快就没事了，西蒙总是晕倒
He'll be all right.
Simon's always throwing a faint.

70
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,765
现在让我们决定我们该做点什么
Now let's decide
what we're going to do.

71
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:27,936
就为这，拉尔夫才召开这个会，
来决定我们该怎么办
That's why Ralph made a meeting -
so as we can decide what to do.

72
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,314
我们已经晓得了一些名字
We got most names.

73
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,692
那两个 - 他们是双胞胎，
萨姆和埃里克
Those two - they're twins.

88
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,576

- And that boy there. He -
- You're talking too much.

89
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,287
- 闭嘴，胖子
- 他可不叫胖子
- Shut up, Fatty!
- His name's not Fatty.

90
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,748
- 他真名叫猪崽子
- 猪崽子
- His real name's Piggy.
- Piggy!

91
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,560
咱们该想想怎么才能得救
We've got to decide
about being rescued.

92
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,521
我觉得该有个头儿来对某些事情下决定
I think we ought to have
a chief to decide things.

93
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,357
必须有人负责
Yeah, someone must take charge.

94
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,317
- 我要当头头
- 他有海螺！
- I ought to be chief.
- Him with the shell!

95
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:01,029
- 是他把我们集合到这里的
- 我是合唱团的头儿
- He got us together.
- I'm chief chorister and head boy.

96
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:05,576
大伙儿投票表决
Let's have a vote.

97
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,703
好的，我们投票
All right. We'll have a vote.

98
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,414
谁要杰克当头儿
Who wants Jack for chief then?

99
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,010
- 谁要我当

100
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,345
- 我！

101
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,389
我，我
Me. Me.

102
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,652
那我当选头头了
I'm chief then.

103
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:49,077
杰克负责合唱团，你们希望他们做什么？
Jack's in charge of the choir.
What do you want them to be?

104
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,372
猎手
Hunters.

105
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,626
合唱队，脱掉你们的外套
Choir, take off your togs.

106
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,842
嗨，你们为什么穿那些可笑的衣服？
Hey, what are you wearing
those funny clothes for?

107
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:08,096
这是我们的制服
It's our uniform.

108
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,440
每个人给我听着，
如果这里不是一个岛屿
Listen, everybody.
If this isn't an island...

109
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,776
咱们可能马上就会得救
we might get rescued straightaway.

110
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,945
所以咱们得决定这是不是一个岛
So we've got to decide if it is.

111
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,656
我们将挑选三个人去探险
Three of us will go
on an expedition to find out.

112
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,116
我去
I'll go...

113
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,910
还有杰克
and Jack.

114
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,704
- 还有
- 请带上我
- And -
- Take me. Please.

115
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,873
你，你还好吗？
You. You all right now?

116
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,963
- 我也要去
- 我们用不着你，三个尽够了
- I'll come.
- We don't want you. Three's enough.

117
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,757
他刚找到海螺那阵子我就跟他在一起
I was with him
when he found the conch.

118
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,094
我早就跟他在一块儿，比谁都早
I was with him
before anyone else was.

119
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:58,647
- 你不能来
- 你告诉了他们
- You can't come.
- You told them after what I said -

120
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,150
我说了以后还告诉他们
after I said I didn't want -

121
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,152
你到底在说什么呀？
What on earth are you talking about?

122
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,655
关于称呼我猪崽子的事
About being called Piggy.

123
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:11,243
我说过只要他们不叫我猪崽子，别的我不在乎
I said I didn't care
as long as they didn't call me Piggy.

124
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,996
我还说别告诉人
And I said not to tell.

125
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,082
后来你就一下子说了出去
And then you went
and said straight out -

126
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,668
叫你猪崽子总比胖子好
Better Piggy than Fatty.

127
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,421
不管怎样，要是你感到不高兴，我为此而抱歉
And anyway,
I'm sorry if you feel like that.

128
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:26,383
回去吧，猪崽子，去点名。
那是你的活儿，回头见
Go back, Piggy, and take names.
That's your job. So long.

129
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,067
嘿，看
Hey, look!

130
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,573
一，二，三
One, two, three.

131
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,408
推！
Heave!

132
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,079
推！
Heave!

133
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,476
我们在一个无人岛上
We're on an uninhabited island.

134
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,312
我们不得不自己照顾自己
We shall have to look after ourselves.

135
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,734
但这是一个很好的岛屿，
还有很多水果淡水
But it's a good island.
There's lots of fruit, water...

136
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,904
我敢肯定不会有任何危险动物
and I'm pretty sure there aren't
any dangerous animals.

137
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,989
事情并不那么坏
So things aren't so bad.

138
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,034
我们没有人受伤
None of us are hurt.

139
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,954
并无任何危险
There isn't any danger...

140
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,499
我们可以建很舒适的棚屋
and we can build shelters
and be comfortable.

141
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,879
如果我们很理智，
如果我们能合理地做事
So if we're sensible,
if we do things properly...

142
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:36,049
如果我们不迷失自我，
我们会过的很好的
if we don't lose our head,
we'll be all right.

143
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,595
- 不过我们在哪里睡觉？
- 我们会建棚屋
- But where will we sleep?
- We'll build shelters.

144
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,764
我们会玩得很开心的
We can have smashing fun.

145
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,601
还有件事，咱们不能许多人同时发言
And another thing.
We can't have everybody talking at once.

146
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,938
必须像在学校里那样来个“举手发言”
We shall have to put our hands up,
like we do at school.

147
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,607
然后我给他海螺
Then I'll give him the conch.

148
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:56,570
我同意拉尔夫，咱们要做些规定并遵守
I agree with Ralph.
We've got to have rules and obey them.

149
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:59,239
毕竟，我们不是野蛮人，我们是英格兰人
After all, we're not savages.
We're English.

150
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,741
英格兰人做任何事都是最好的
And the English are best at everything.

151
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:06,121
因此我们将会有更多的规矩，当有人打破它们——
So we'll have lots of rules,
and when anybody breaks them -

152
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,461
- 猪崽子！猪崽子！猪崽子！
- 安静
- Piggy, Piggy, Piggy!
- Quiet!

153
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:17,757
你们不让拉尔夫说最重要的话吗？
You're not letting Ralph
get to the most important thing.

154
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,428
谁知道我们在这里？
Who knows we're here?

155
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,140
没有人知道我们在这里
Nobody knows we're here.

156
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,685
或许他们知道我们将要去哪里
Perhaps they knew
where we were going to...

157
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,104
或许不知道
perhaps not.

158
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:35,233
但是他们不知道我们现在在这里，因为我们没有到那儿
But they don't know where we are now
'cause we never got there.

159
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,612
我们也许要待在这里直到我们死去
We might stay here till we die.

160
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:04,095
他想知道你打算怎么处理关于蛇的事
He wants to know what you're going to do
about the snake thing.

161
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,849
告诉我们关于蛇的事
Tell us about the snake thing.

162
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,064
现在他说这是只野兽
Now he says it was a beastie.

163
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,857
野兽？
Beastie?

164
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:23,114
- 一个像蛇的东西，相当大。他看见那东西了
- 什么时候？
- A snake thing, ever so big. He saw it.
- When?

165
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:30,288
当他躲在黑暗的丛林中时
When he was hiding
in the jungle in the dark.

166
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,377
他说是在雨停了时
He says when the rain stopped...

167
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:39,673
它变成一个绳子一样的东西，挂在树上
it turned into one of them things
like ropes in the trees...

168
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,008
就挂在树枝上
and hung in the branches.

169
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,345
他说：“夜里它会回来吗？”
He says,
"Will it come back tonight?"

170
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,937
但是，这儿没有野兽
But there isn't a beastie.

171
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,523
我告诉你们，这儿没有野兽
I tell you, there isn't a beast.

172
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,901
拉尔夫是对的，确实
Ralph's right, of course.

173
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:04,614
没有什么蛇一样的东西。
如果有，我们就抓住它，杀掉它
There isn't a snake thing,
but if there was, we'd hunt and kill it.

174
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,575
还有件事
There's another thing.

175
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,036
如果附近出船只，他们无法注意到我们
If a ship comes near the island,
they may not notice us.

176
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:13,456
所以我们必须在山顶弄出烟来，我们需要生火
So we must make smoke on top
of the mountain. We must make a fire.

177
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,166
来，跟着我
Come on! Follow me!

178
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,419
- 好
- 现在就走
- Yes!
- Let's go now!

179
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:26,136
真像小孩子————一群小孩子
Just like kids -
like a crowd of kids.

180
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,977
我打赌是吃茶点的时候了
I bet it's gone teatime.

181
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,867
谁有火柴？
Anybody got any matches?

182
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,792
哎呀，你们搞了这么个大堆！
My, what a big heap you've made!

183
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,003
猪崽子的眼镜，来！
Piggy's specs!
Come on!

184
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,057
站开，别挡光
Get out of the light!

185
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,934
罗杰，嘿，罗杰。过来这里
Roger. Hey, Roger.
Come on over here.

186
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,411
我的眼镜
My specs!

187
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,961
拉尔夫，我将把合唱队————我的猎手们分开
Ralph, I'll split up my choir -
my hunters, that is -

188
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,714
我们负责看管生火堆的事
and we'll be responsible
for keeping the fire going.

189
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:51,262
我们会弄个大火堆的，它会持续一整晚
We'll make a big blaze now.
It'll last all night.

190
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,019
过来帮帮忙
Come and give us a hand, will you?

191
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,658
立正！
Attention!

192
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,926
来一个
Here comes one.

193
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,804
这个很好
This is a nice one.

194
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,485
等一下，小心
Just a minute. Be careful.

195
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:34,908
冲！
Go!

196
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,577
不！
No!

197
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,455
- 你要打我吗？
- 不，这不会伤着你的
- You're gonna hit me, huh?
- No, this isn't gonna hit you!

198
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,873
噢！
Ooh!

199
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,792
加油，加油，加油！
Come on, come on! Come on!

200
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,820
杀！杀！杀！
Kill! Kill! Kill!

201
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,617
别扔沙子
No throwing sand!

202
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:53,713
拉尔夫，快来，一架飞机！
Ralph, come here! It's a plane!

203
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,840
飞机！飞机！
A plane! A plane!

204
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:59,719
你没听见吗？拉尔夫，它走了，赶快，拉尔夫！
Can't you hear it? Ralph, it's going!
Hurry up! Ralph!

205
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,975
我没看见烟，在哪里？
I can't see no smoke.
Where is it?

206
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,896
烟！
Smoke.

207
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,900
猪崽子的眼镜！要是火灭了，咱们用得上！
Piggy's glasses!
If the fire's out, we'll need them!

208
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:38,091
停下！回来！回来！
Stop! Come back!
Come back!

209
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:42,261
回来！回来！
Come back! Come back!

210
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,782
他们让火给灭了
They've let the bloody fire out!

211
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,499
杀野猪哟！割喉咙哟！狠狠揍哟！
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

212
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,960
杀野猪哟！割喉咙哟！狠狠揍哟！
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

213
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:15,503
嘿，拉尔夫！
Hey, Ralph!

214
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,088
割喉咙哟！狠狠揍哟！

215
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,173
杀野猪哟！割喉咙哟！
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!

216
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,843
杀野猪哟！割喉咙哟！狠狠揍哟！
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

217
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,512
杀野猪哟！割喉咙哟！狠狠揍哟！
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

218
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,181
杀野猪哟！割喉咙哟！狠狠揍哟！
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

219
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,976
杀野猪哟！割喉咙哟！狠狠揍哟！
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

220
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,437
杀野猪哟！割喉咙哟！狠狠揍哟！
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

221
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,356
杀野猪哟！割喉咙哟！狠狠揍哟！
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

224
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:44,574

Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in! Kill the pig!

225
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:47,410
瞧，我们宰了头猪，我们悄悄的扑上去，
组成一个包围圈
Look. We killed a pig!
We stole up on it. We got in a circle -

226
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,454
你们让火给灭了
You let the fire out.

227
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,249
我们可以再把它生起来
We can light it up again.

228
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,342
你应该跟我们在一起，拉尔夫
You should have been with us, Ralph.

229
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,636
流了好多血，你会看见的
There was lots of blood.
You should have seen it.

230
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:09,765
有过一架飞机，有飞机！
There was a plane.
There was a plane!

231
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:14,896
他们本可能发现咱么的，咱们说不定就可以回家了
They might have seen us.
We might have gone home!

232
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:30,328
你和你们的鲜血，杰克梅瑞狄！
You and your blood, Jack Merridew!

233
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:33,414
你和你该死的打猎，我们也许都已经回家了
You and your hunting!
We might have gone home!

234
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:35,416
咱们需要肉
We needed meat.

235
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,547
你们不该把火弄灭了
You didn't
ought to have let the fire go out!

236
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,596
我的眼镜
My specs!

237
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,225
这儿，在这儿呢
Here. Here they are.

238
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:15,206
你们等着瞧吧
Just you wait!

239
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,543
真是个卑鄙的把戏
That was a dirty trick.

240
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:21,587
好吧，好吧，对不起
All right, all right.
I'm sorry!

241
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,881
我意思是关于火
About the fire, I mean.

242
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,841
好吧
There.

243
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,719
我赔不是
I apologize.

244
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,015
点火
Light the fire then.

245
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,017
合唱团！
Choir!

246
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,152
- 猪崽子
- 不, 拉尔夫, 请不要这样！
- Piggy.
- No, Ralph, don't! Please!

247
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,196
我会还给你的
I'll bring them back.

248
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,672
- 腿会胀起来么？
- 给我一块好的
- Will it swell up his legs?
- Give me a nice piece!

249
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,841
给我一只腿
Give me a leg, will ya?

250
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,884
- 给我
- 请给我一块
- Give it to me.
- Give me a piece, please.

251
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,103
我难道没有么？
Aren't I havin' none?

252
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,272
你没打猎
You didn't hunt.

253
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:07,318
拉尔夫也没有，西蒙也没有
No more did Ralph.
No more did Simon.

254
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,618
吃吧，该死的
Eat, damn you!

255
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:33,052
- 杀野猪哟！
- 呼噜，呼噜，呼噜，呼噜，呼噜，呼噜
- Kill the pig!
- Oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink.

256
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:37,473
杀野猪哟！割喉咙哟！狠狠揍哟！
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

257
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,267
杀野猪哟！割喉咙哟！狠狠揍哟！
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

258
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,187
杀野猪哟！割喉咙哟！狠狠揍哟！
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

259
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,065
杀野猪哟！割喉咙哟！狠狠揍哟！
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

260
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,984
杀野猪哟！割喉咙哟！狠狠揍哟！
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

261
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,653
杀野猪哟！割喉咙哟！
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat!

262
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,321
安静！
Quiet!

263
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:56,158
到海滩去，我要开会
Get down on the beach.
I'm calling an assembly.

264
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,840
事情变糟了
Things are beginning to break up.

265
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,344
我不知道为什么
I don't know why.

266
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,305
开始时一切还好
It all began well.

267
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,976
不过现在人们开始忘了什么最重要
Then people started forgetting
what really matters.

268
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:28,607
我们最重要的事
The most important thing
for all of us...

269
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,735
是得救
is getting rescued.

270
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,824
现在我们需要讨论谁干什么，在我们决定好之时
So now let's discuss who does what,
and when we have decided...

271
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,661
我们就可以重新开始了
we can start again...

272
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,623
对于火堆的事儿可得注意
and be careful
about things like the fire.

273
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:49,170
好了，也就是火灭了罢了
All right, so the fire went out.

274
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:52,089
但我们是猎手，我们给你们肉吃
But we're hunters.
We got you meat.

275
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:53,883
并且如果有野兽
And if there is a beast...

276
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:56,802
我的猎手们会保护你们的
it's my hunters
who will protect you from it.

277
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,359
你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

278
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,528
你叫什么？你叫什么？
What's your name? What's your name?

279
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,530
你叫什么？你叫什么？
What's your name? What's your name?

280
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,533
你叫什么？你叫什么？你叫什么？
What's your name?
What's your name? What's your name?

281
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,660
你叫什么？你叫什么？你叫什么？
What's your name? What's your name?
What's your name?

282
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:24,622
安静！安静！
Quiet! Quiet!

283
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,793
你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

284
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,588
珀西佛尔·威密斯·麦迪逊
Percival Williams Madison,
the Vicarage...

285
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,382
哈考特·圣安东尼教区
Hartcourt, St. Anthony.

286
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:40,971
电话——
Telephone -

287
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,143
电——
Tele -

288
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,033
好了？
Ready?

289
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,608
他了说什么？
What did he say?

290
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,610
他说有只野兽
He says there's a beast.

291
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,904
它从海里来
It comes out of the sea.

292
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:04,597
爸爸说过，人们还没有发现海中的说有动物呢
My daddy said they haven't found
all the animals in the sea.

293
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:08,058
我爸爸说那东西——
My daddy says there are animals -

294
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:10,686
你们叫它们什么来着
What do you call them?

295
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,898
它们会造出墨水来，有几百码长
They make ink
and are hundreds of feet long...

296
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,941
能吃下整条鲸鱼
and eat whales whole.

297
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:19,403
乌贼不会从水中跑出来的
A squid can't come out of the water.

298
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,546
大概他指的是一种鬼魂
Maybe he means
it's some sort of ghost.

299
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:41,091
也许野兽就是————鬼魂
Maybe that's
what the beast is - a ghost.

300
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:51,977
我根本不相信有鬼，从来不信
I don't believe in no ghosts. Ever.

301
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:55,481
谁管你信不信————胖子
Who cares what you believe, Fatty?

302
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:02,488
也许真的有野兽
Maybe there is a beast.

303
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:05,366
听他的，他有海螺
Hear him. He's got the conch.

304
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,206
我的意思是
What I mean is...

305
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,459
也许那只是我们自己
maybe it's only us.

306
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,962
疯子！
Nuts!

307
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,971
我们应该把所有事情留到天亮
We should have left all this till daylight.

308
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,015
我们都累了
We're tired.

309
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:35,646
我们投票决定有没有鬼
We'll have a vote -
on ghosts, I mean -

310
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,274
然后回棚屋
and then go back
to the shelters.

311
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,654
谁认为也许有鬼魂？
Who thinks there may be ghosts?

312
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:07,261
- 我知道了
- 我投票赞成没有鬼
- I see.
- I didn't vote for no ghosts.

313
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,930
你们全都记住了
Remember that, all of you.

314
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:13,475
- 你住口，你这个胖懒虫
- 我有海螺
- You shut up, you fat slug!
- I got the conch!

315
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,686
杰克，让他说，他有海螺
Oh, Jack, let him speak.
He's got the conch.

316
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,106
你也闭嘴！不管怎样，你算什么东西？
干坐在那儿————对人发号施令
And you shut up. Who are you anyway,
just sitting there, telling people what to do?

317
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,067
- 你不会打猎，不会唱歌
- 我是头头，大家选我的
- You can't hunt. You can't sing.
- I'm chief. I was chosen.

318
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:24,945
选你又怎样？只会发号施令
Why should choosing make any difference,
telling people what to do?

319
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,824
- 猪崽子拿着海螺
- 对呀，你总是向着猪崽子
- Piggy's got the conch.
- That's right. Favor Piggy as you always do.

320
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,243
- 杰克！
- 杰克！杰克！
- Jack!
- "Jack!" "Jack!"

321
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,579
- 规则，你在破坏规则！
- 谁在乎？
- The rules. You're breaking the rules!
- Who cares?

322
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,956
因为规则是我们所有的唯一东西
Because the rules are
the only thing we've got.

323
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,459
让规则见鬼去吧！我们是强有力的，我们会打猎
Bollocks to the rules!
We're strong. We hunt.

324
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,378
要是有野兽，我们就把它打倒，揍了再揍
If there's a beast,
we'll hunt it down and beat and beat!

325
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:53,724
大人们会怎么说呢？瞧瞧他们那个模样
What's grown-ups going to say?
Look at 'em!

326
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:59,396
我感觉我应该放弃头头的位子了
I think I ought to give up being chief.

327
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:04,693
你不能这样，拉尔夫，现在不行
You can't, Ralph. Not now.

328
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,738
吹海螺
Blow the conch.

329
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:12,409
你还拿着海螺呢，让他们照你说的去做
You've got to be tough.
Make them do what you want.

330
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,791
如果我吹海螺…
If I blow the conch...

331
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,335
他们也不回来
and they don't come back...

332
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,587
那咱们就自作自受了
then we've had it.

333
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:40,604
有没有鬼呢，猪崽子？有没有野兽呢？
Are there ghosts, Piggy?
Or beasts?

334
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,689
当然没喽
Of course there aren't.

335
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:47,611
- 为什么没呢？
- 因为事情会讲不通
- Why not?
- Because things wouldn't make sense.

336
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,781
房子啦、马路啦
Houses and streets...

337
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,034
电视啦
and TV.

338
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,036
那些东西不会起作用
They wouldn't work.

339
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:03,001
假如它们讲不通？在这儿，在这个岛上
But suppose they wouldn't make sense,
not here on this island.

340
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,048
假如它们正在观察着咱们
Supposing things are watching us...

341
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,092
等着机会呢？
and waiting.

342
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,720
继续做头头，拉尔夫
Go on being chief, Ralph.

343
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:17,266
- 谁在那？
- 我，西蒙
- Who's there?
- Me, Simon.

344
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,022
我姨妈在这儿就好了
I wish my auntie were here.

345
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:26,650
那管什么用？
Oh, what's the use?

346
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,070
大人懂事
Grown-ups know things.

347
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,531
他们不怕黑暗
They ain't afraid of the dark.

348
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:36,243
他们聚会、喝茶、讨论
They'd meet and have tea and discuss.

349
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,745
然后一切都会好的
Then things would be all right.

350
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:47,397
- 萨姆
- 怎么了？
- Sam.
- What's the matter?

351
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,399
嘘！
Shh!

352
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:16,551
- 它毛茸茸的
- 头的后面
- It was furry.
- There was something moving...

353
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:19,763
有东西飘来飘去————翅膀
behind his head - wings.

354
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:22,849
它那么直挺挺地坐起来
It sort of sat up.

355
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,851
有眼睛
It had eyes...

356
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,062
牙齿，爪子
teeth, claws.

357
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:32,234
我们俩没命地奔跑
We ran as fast as we could,
bashed into things.

358
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,528
野兽跟着我们俩
The beast followed us.

359
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,405
差一点抓住我
Nearly caught me.

360
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:41,368
你们没开玩笑吧，有么？
You're not pulling our legs, are you?

361
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,248
- 我们去抓住它，谁要去？
- 我！我！
- We'll hunt it. Who'll come?
- Me! Me!

362
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:50,544
那些长矛是用木头做的，别傻了
But those sticks -
they're made of wood. Don't be so silly.

363
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,505
- 害怕了？
- 当然怕了，谁会不怕？
- Frightened?
- Of course I am. Who wouldn't be?

364
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,591
- 来吧，我们走
- 谁来照顾小家伙们？
- Come on. Let's go.
- Who'll mind the little ones?

365
00:43:56,676 --> 00:44:00,178
- 猪崽子来照管他们
- 好呀，让猪崽子别冒风险
- Piggy will look after them.
- That's right. Keep Piggy out of danger.

366
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,180
动动脑筋吧
Haven't you got any sense?

367
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,683
猪崽子一只眼能干得了什么？
How can Piggy help with only one eye?

368
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:11,565
杰克，在岛上你还有什么地方没去过？
Jack, is there anywhere
on this island where we haven't been?

369
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,567
只有————当然啰
There's only -
Of course!

370
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,278
岛的尾端，山岩都堆积起来的那个地方
The tail end part,
where the rocks pile up.

371
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:07,204
我是头儿，我一个人去
I'm chief. I'll go on alone.

372
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:10,207
其他人待在这儿藏着
The rest of you wait here and hide.

373
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,923
你是不是认为————
Do you think -

374
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:21,134
我到处都去过了，那东西准在这儿
I've been all over.
It must be here.

375
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:32,104
我不相信有什么野兽
I... don't believe in the beast.

376
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,816
我猜也没有
I suppose not.

377
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,803
不能让你独个儿干那
Couldn't let you do it on your own.

378
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:14,164
这地方很适合做堡垒
What a place for a fort!

379
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:24,925
野兽不在这儿
The beast isn't here.

380
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:27,636
我们去找其他人，然后去山顶
Let's get the others and go on to the top.

381
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:40,982
故事是关于我住的地方
Now, this story is about
the place where I live...

382
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:43,527
叫Camberley
called Camberley.

383
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:46,947
Camberley是一个很安静很老的地方
Now, Camberley is quite an old place...

384
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:50,700
不过它不是一直被称为Camberley的
but it hasn't been called Camberley
all the time.

385
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:54,871
它过去被称为Cambridgetown
It used to be called Cambridgetown.

386
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:58,583
人们总是把Cambridge和Cambridgetown
And they used to get mixed up
with the letters...

387
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:02,963
两者搞混
between Cambridge
or Cambridgetown.

388
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:07,133
所以寄往Cambridgetown的人的信件
So letters that were to a person
in Cambridgetown...

389
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:10,804
常被送往了Cambridge
used to go to a person in Cambridge.

390
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,473
人们有点混乱了
So they got a bit mixed up.

391
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:17,060
所以他们想要改掉邮局上的名字
So they thought they'd change
the name at the post office...

392
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:21,523
因为邮局需要排列信件
because it was the post office
that had all the trouble of sorting the letters.

393
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:26,903
他们认为需要把Cambridgetown中的cam留下
And they thought they'd leave
the "cam" from Cambridgetown...

394
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:28,071
然后他们——
and they -

395
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,656
“ber”指的是河
and "ber" is a river...

396
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,450
那儿周围有很多条河
and there are a lot of rivers round there.

397
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:40,041
“Camber”，然后加上了“ley”。
因为很多城镇名都以“ley”结尾
"Camber." And then "ley," because a lot
of the towns near there ended with "ley."

398
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,294
它们的名字以“ley”结尾
Their names ended with "ley."

399
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:46,006
所以他们叫它Cam-ber-ley，Camberley
So they called it Cam-ber-ley.
Camberley.

400
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,258
这是Camberley的真实故事
And that's the true story of Camberley.

401
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:03,857
咱们不能听凭小家伙单跟猪崽子在一起
I don't think we should leave Piggy
with the little uns. Not all night.

402
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,611
我们不能让猪崽子出什么乱子，是不是？
We mustn't let anything
happen to Piggy, must we?

403
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:12,866
得有人去告诉他们我们天黑以后才回去
I think someone should go back
and tell them we won't be back till after dark.

404
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,370
我去，我不在乎
I'll go. I don't mind.

405
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:18,788
老实说
Honestly.

406
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,360
我们去海滩
We'll go to the beach.

407
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,237
我们可以明天爬上山顶
We can go to the top tomorrow.

408
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,907
要是你吓坏了，那当然
If you're frightened, of course.

409
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,159
好吧，谁想要现在就爬山？
All right then. Who wants to go now?

410
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,579
你瞧？
You see?

411
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:03,291
我打算上山去找野兽，现在就去
I'm going to climb the mountain
to look for the beast - now.

412
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:05,210
- 你去吗？
- 我不在乎
- Coming?
- I don't mind.

413
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:07,128
要是你不在乎，那当然
If you don't mind, of course.

414
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:08,797
我根本不在乎
Not at all!

415
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:14,469
咱们真傻，为什么就两个人上呢？
I think it's silly only two of us go.

416
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:19,015
要是发现什么东西，两个人可不够
If we meet anything on the other side,
two won't be enough.

417
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,190
好吧，走，罗杰
All right.
Come along, Roger.

418
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:47,460
要是你不想再上去了，我就一个人上
If you don't want to go on,
I'll go myself.

419
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,255
那就去吧，我们在这儿等着
Go on then.
We'll wait here.

420
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:02,767
闭嘴
Shut up.

421
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,652
我看到山上有个东西
I saw a thing on top.

422
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:16,239
发出嘈杂声，一种“噗噗”的响声
There was a noise too.
Kind of "plop."

423
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,892
贴近地面
Keep close to the ground.

424
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:53,651
那边，被石头挡住了
Over there, gap in the rock.

425
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,688
首先, 你们知道现在我们看见了野兽
First, you know now
we've seen the beast.

426
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:35,777
我们爬过去了，我们在野兽几英尺以外
We crawled up.
We were only a few feet away.

427
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,987
那野兽坐了起来看着我们
The beast sat up and looked at us.

428
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:42,492
我不认为我们能打败它，老实说，你知道的
I don't think we could fight a thing
that size. Honestly, you know.

429
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:46,496
我们谈谈，我们不能去攻击老虎什么的
We're talk,
but we couldn't fight a tiger.

430
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,583
咱们会躲起来，连杰克都会躲起来
We'd hide.
Even Jack would hide.

431
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:54,003
- 我们的猎人怎么样？
- 那些拿木棒作武器的孩子们？
- What about my hunters?
- Boys armed with sticks?

432
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,380
好了，那么
All right then.

433
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:00,969
他不是一个猎人，
他从来没有为我们弄到肉
He's not a hunter.
He'd never have got us meat.

434
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:04,764
他只知发布命令，想要大家遵守
He's just giving orders,
expects people to obey for nothing.

435
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:07,642
他就像猪崽子，说话都像猪崽子
He's like Piggy.
He says things like Piggy.

436
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,686
他不是个真正的头头，他是个孬种
He's not a proper chief.
He's a coward.

437
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,730
在山顶上，罗杰和我朝前的时候，他赖在后面
On top, when Roger and me went on,
he stayed back.

438
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:14,983
- 我也上了！
- 那是后来
- I went too.
- After.

439
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:18,486
我也上去了，后来我跑了，你也跑了
I went on too, then I went away.
So did you.

440
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,947
还叫我胆小鬼，扯淡
Call me a coward then.
All this talk.

441
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,241
- 这一切扯淡，扯淡，扯淡！
- 那好吧
- All this talk, talk, talk.
- Right.

442
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:26,286
我不想跟拉尔夫同命运
I'm not gonna be part of Ralph's lot.

443
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:30,623
我要独自走开，去打猎吃肉，痛痛快快地玩
I'm going off by myself to the rocks
to hunt and have feasts and have fun.

444
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,668
还有谁要走？
Anyone who wants can come too.

445
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,213
杰克！
Jack!

446
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:11,331
我说我们少一个人也能干
I said we could do
without a certain person.

447
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:14,125
我认为现在我们要下决心
Now I think we've got to decide.

448
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,586
没有杰克梅瑞狄咱们也能干
We can do without Jack Merridew.

449
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,839
岛上除了他还有别人呢
There's others besides him
on this island.

450
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:22,425
但是现在我们真的发现了一只野兽
But now we've really got a beast -

451
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:25,178
虽然我很难相信
though I can hardly believe it -

452
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,431
咱们必须靠近平台待着
we'll need to stay close
to the platform.

453
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:34,020
我一直在跟你说话，拉尔夫
I've been talking, Ralph.

454
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,355
什么？
What?

455
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:38,024
咱们山上的火堆是没了
We've got no fire on the mountain...

456
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:41,277
可是在下面这儿搞一个火堆又有什么不好呢？
but what's wrong
with a fire down here?

457
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:46,282
好主意，我们可以在棚屋之间筑个火堆
That's a good idea. We can build it
right here between the shelters.

458
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:49,702
我认为咱们该爬上山去
I think we ought
to climb the mountain.

459
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,788
那又怎么办呢？
What's the use?

460
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,380
还有其他的什么要做的？
What else is there to do?

461
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,940
放上些干叶子，确保他们是干的
And put some dry leaves on.
Make sure they're dry.

462
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:03,359
那才会烧着
So it'll burn.

463
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:05,570
如果是潮湿的，就不会正常燃烧
If they're wet,
it won't burn properly.

464
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:41,939
快
Come on.

465
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,441
快
Come on.

466
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:55,555
上！
Now!

467
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,395
正中屁股
Right up the ass.

468
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:05,374
弄一根木棒，把两头削尖
Sharpen a stick at both ends.

469
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:35,112
这个猪头是献给野兽的
This head is for the beast.

470
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:36,697
猪头是供品
It's a gift.

471
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:49,377
难道他们就看不出？
难道他们就不明白？
Can't they see?
Don't they understand?

472
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:55,258
没有烟作信号，咱们就会死在这儿
Unless we keep the smoke burning,
we'll die.

473
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:00,763
怎么了，猪崽子？
What's wrong, Piggy?

474
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:06,102
为什么事情会出错？
Why are things going wrong like they are?

475
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:10,022
我不知道，拉尔夫
I don't know, Ralph.

476
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:12,149
# Kyrie, kyrie #

494
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:05,805
就要下倾盆大雨了
Looks like we're going to have
a lot of rain, all right.

495
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:08,391
火堆怎么样呢？
What about the fire?

496
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:26,409
嘿，回来，这是个卑鄙诡计
Hey, come back! That was a mean trick!

497
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:30,371
如果你要的话，我们会给你的
We would have given it to you if you asked.

498
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:52,703
给他们点吃的
Take 'em some food.

499
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,214
香蕉！
Bananas!

500
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,689
谁要加入我的部落？
Who'll join my tribe?

501
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:27,488
杰克，我要加入你的部落，杰克
Jack. I'll join your tribe, Jack.

502
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:34,828
- 谁要加入我的部落？
- 我加入
- Who'll join my tribe?
- I want to join.

503
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:40,584
我给你们吃的，我的猎手们会保护你们免遭野兽的伤害
I gave you food, and my hunters
will protect you from the beast.

504
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,631
- 谁要加入我的部落？
- 我加入，杰克
- Who'll join my tribe?
- I will, Jack.

505
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:50,261
我是头头，火堆怎么样？我有海螺
I'm chief. And what about the fire?
And I've got the conch!

506
01:04:50,345 --> 01:04:53,764
你没带着它，你把它丢在那儿没有带来
You haven't got it with you.
You left it behind.

507
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:57,309
明白些，放聪明点吧？
See? Clever.

508
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,147
海螺在岛的这一头不算数
Anyway, the conch doesn't count
on this end of the island.

509
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:05,317
海螺在这个岛的任何地方都算数
The conch counts here
and all over the island.

510
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:09,363
谁要加入我的部落？
Who'll join my tribe?

511
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:10,698
- 我，我！
- 我加入！
- Me, me!
- I will!

512
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:13,367
- 让我们加入杰克的部落！
- 耶！
- Let's join Jack's tribe!
- Yeah!

513
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:19,373
走吧，会惹出麻烦的
Come away.
There's going to be trouble.

514
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:09,233
杀野兽哟！
Kill... the... beast!

515
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:11,568
杀野兽哟！杀野猪哟！
Kill the beast!
Kill the pig!

516
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:14,279
割喉咙哟！狠狠揍哟！
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

517
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:18,367
杀野猪哟！割喉咙哟！狠狠揍哟！
Kill the beast!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

518
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:21,620
杀野猪哟！割喉咙哟！狠狠揍哟！
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

519
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:24,832
杀野猪哟！割喉咙哟！狠狠揍哟！
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

520
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:27,960
杀野猪哟！
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

521
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,713
- 杀野猪哟！
- 杀野猪哟！
- Kill the pig!
- Kill the pig!

522
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:44,643
杀野兽哟！割喉咙哟！干掉它哟！
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

523
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:47,146

Kill the beast! Slit his throat!

Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!

526
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:54,987
杀野兽哟！割喉咙哟！干掉它哟！
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

527
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,614
杀野兽哟！割喉咙哟！干掉它哟！
Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!

528
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,825
杀野兽哟！割喉咙哟！干掉它哟！
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

529
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:02,286
杀野兽哟！割喉咙哟！干掉它哟！
Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!

530
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:04,371
杀野兽哟！割喉咙哟！
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat!

531
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:09,168
杀野兽哟！割喉咙哟！干掉它哟！
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

532
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:11,670
杀野兽哟！割喉咙哟！干掉它哟！
Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!

533
01:08:11,755 --> 01:08:14,757
杀野兽哟！割喉咙哟！干掉它哟！
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

534
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:16,341
看！
Look!

535
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:19,970
野兽！
The beast!

536
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,839
杀！杀！
Kill! Kill!

537
01:08:55,924 --> 01:08:58,217
杀！杀！杀！
Kill! Kill! Kill!

538
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:10,938
# Kyrie #

539
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:13,232
# Kyrie #

540
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:46,723
# Kyrie eleison #

541
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:53,146
# Eleison ##

542
01:11:09,432 --> 01:11:12,768
猪崽子？剩下的就你一个？
Piggy, are you the only one left?

543
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,312
还有几个小家伙
There are some little uns.

544
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:18,357
他们不算数，没大家伙了？
They don't count.
No big uns?

545
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:23,445
噢，萨姆和埃里克，他们在拾柴火
Oh, Sam and Eric.
They're collecting wood.

546
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:27,115
- 没有别人了吗？
- 据我说知并没有
- Nobody else?
- Not that I know of.

547
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:44,758
猪崽子
Piggy.

548
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:50,013
- 猪崽子
- 嗯？
- Piggy.
- Huh?

549
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:52,140
那是谋杀呀
That was murder.

550
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:57,270
别说了！你老那样唠叨有什么好处？
You stop it!
What good are you doing talking like that?

551
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:02,776
那时天昏地暗，加上那该死的狂舞
It was dark!
There was that bloody dance!

552
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:06,113
又是闪电，又是霹雳，又是暴雨
There was thunder
and lightning and rain!

553
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:08,907
咱们全吓坏了
We were scared!

554
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:13,245
那可不是——像你说的那样
It wasn't... what you said.

555
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:15,205
哦，猪崽子！
Oh, Piggy!

556
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:18,709
这是意外
It was an accident.

557
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:28,093
他疯了
He was batty.

558
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,555
他自找的，这是一次意外
He asked for it.
It was an accident.

559
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,852
哦，上帝啊，我要回家
Oh, God, I want to go home.

560
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,031
把他带走
Take him away!

561
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,048
明天，我们又要去打猎了
Tomorrow, I'll hunt again.

562
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,052
我们需要另一个猪头献给怪兽
Then we'll leave another head
for the beast.

563
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:21,313
你们留下一些人看守这里
Some of you will stay
and defend the gate.

564
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:25,150
野兽也想要进来
The beast may try and come in.

565
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,408
记得它是怎么爬的吧
Remember how he crawled?

566
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:36,620
它化了装来的
He came disguised.

567
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:39,331
野兽会尝试着混进来
The beast may try and come...

568
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:42,793
即使咱们杀了猪，把猪头给它吃
even though we gave him
the head of our kill to eat.

569
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:45,087
所以得提防着，得当心点
So watch and be careful.

570
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:51,259
但是咱们能不能，能不能——？
But didn't we -
Didn't we -

571
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:56,348
不，咱们怎么能杀掉它呢？
No. How could we kill it?

572
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:05,440
他告诉我们，野兽是会伪装的
He told us.
The beast was disguised.

573
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:11,071
明天我们将去打猎，然后大吃一顿
Tomorrow, when we get meat,
we'll have a feast.

574
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:15,534
- 头领
- 嗯？比尔
- Chief?
- Yes, Bill?

575
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:17,619
咱们用什么来生火呢？
What'll we use to light the fire?

576
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:21,081
我们将从别人那儿去取火种来
We'll get fire from the others.

577
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:26,044
咱们一定得摆脱这个地方
We've got to get out of this.

578
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:28,046
这话怎么讲？
What do you mean?

579
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:29,840
要得救
Get rescued.

580
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:32,634
这就是我的意思
I mean it.

581
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:37,347
要不赶快回家，咱们都会发疯
If we don't get out of here soon,
we'll be barmy.

582
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:40,183
- 神经错乱
- 发狂
- Round the bend.
- Crackers.

583
01:14:48,693 --> 01:14:51,862
你最近给你姨妈写信了么？
Have you written a letter
to your auntie lately?

584
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:54,322
我不知道眼下她在哪儿
I don't know where she is now...

585
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:57,492
我没有信封，没有邮票
and I haven't got
an envelope or a stamp...

586
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:01,413
再说既没有邮箱，也没有邮递员
and there isn't
a pillar-box or a postman.

587
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,334
我可没说什么，有那么好笑
I haven't said anything very funny.

588
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:15,886
猪崽子！
Piggy-y-y-y!

589
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,555
猪崽子！
Piggy!

590
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:22,809
别吱声
Don't make a sound.

591
01:15:22,894 --> 01:15:25,395
我们来找你了，猪崽子
We're going to get you, Piggy.

592
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:29,191
猪崽子？
Piggy?

593
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:32,736
你在哪儿？猪崽子？
Where are you, Piggy?

594
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:36,031
我们来找你了
We've come to get you.

595
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:06,895
猪崽子，你变样了
Piggy, you've changed!

596
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:09,481
猪崽子
Piggy!

597
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:24,097
我拿着海螺
I just take the conch to say this.

598
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,684
我没有眼镜就看不见东西
I can't see without my glasses...

599
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:30,645
我必须得要回我的眼镜
and I got to get them back.

600
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:33,315
我们要去干什么？
What are we going to do?

601
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:57,505
是谁在那儿？
Hey! Who goes there?

602
01:17:57,590 --> 01:18:00,425
别装傻了，你认得出我是谁！
Stop being silly!
You can see who I am!

603
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:19,486
我要开大会
I'm calling an assembly!

604
01:18:30,373 --> 01:18:33,041
别离开我，拉尔夫！
Don't leave me, Ralph!

605
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:39,047
你坐下，在这儿等我回来
You sit down
and wait for me. Here.

606
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:47,889
你们要干什么？
What do you want?

607
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:52,268
你们滚开，拉尔夫。你们守着你们那一头
Go away, Ralph.
You keep to your end.

608
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:57,357
这儿是我的一头，我的一伙人，你们别来管我
This is my end and my tribe.
You have to leave me alone.

609
01:18:57,441 --> 01:19:01,027
你抢走了猪崽子的眼镜，你一定得还给他
You took Piggy's specs.
You've got to give them back.

610
01:19:01,529 --> 01:19:04,072
一定得？谁说的？
Got to? Who says?

611
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:07,659
我说的！那是一个肮脏把戏
I say! That was a dirty trick.

612
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:10,203
你要火种我们本来是会给你们的
We would have given you fire
if you asked for it.

613
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:12,872
可你不是来要，你像个贼似的偷偷地跑来
But you didn't.
You came sneaking up like a thief.

614
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:16,167
- 你再说一遍
- 贼！贼！
- Say that again.
- Thief! Thief!

615
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:17,919
谁是贼？
Who's a thief?

616
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:20,422
你是
You are!

617
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:25,844
拉尔夫，记得我们来的目的
Ralph!
Remember what we came for.

618
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:28,638
火种，我的眼镜
The fire. My specs.

619
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:31,850
你们不明白吗？或许有船或飞机经过
Don't you see? There may be
a ship out there or a plane!

620
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:42,235
- 抓住他们
- 杰克
- Grab 'em!
- Jack!

621
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:44,654
绑住他们
Tie 'em up!

622
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:50,410
看见吗？他们听我的吩咐
See? They do what I want.

623
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:53,538
你是野兽，是猪猡，是个地地道道的贼
You're a beast and a swine
and a bloody, bloody thief!

624
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:01,963
上，杰克，上
Go, Jack! Go!

625
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:25,069
让我说话
Let me speak!

626
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:27,572
我拿着海螺
I've got the conch!

627
01:20:43,506 --> 01:20:46,132
哪一个好一些？
Which is it better to be?

628
01:20:46,217 --> 01:20:50,345
是像你们那样做一帮涂脸的黑鬼好呢？
A pack of painted savages
like you are...

629
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:53,765
还是像拉尔夫那样做一个明白事理的人好呢？
or sensible like Ralph is?

630
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:57,060
哪一个好一些？
Which is better?

631
01:20:57,144 --> 01:21:01,397
是照规则、讲一致好呢？还是打猎和乱杀好呢？
To have rules and agree,
or to hunt and kill?

632
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:14,869
猪崽子
Piggy!

633
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:37,285
萨姆埃里克，萨姆埃里克
Sam and Eric!
Hey, Sam and Eric.

634
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:39,704
是我，拉尔夫
It's me, Ralph.

635
01:22:43,626 --> 01:22:46,002
逮住我后他们打算怎么办？
When they find me,
what are they going to do?

636
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:50,632
罗杰把一根木棒的两头都削尖了
Roger sharpened a stick at both ends.

637
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:53,009
他们明儿要追捕你
They're going to hurt you tomorrow.

638
01:22:55,763 --> 01:22:58,890
我们要像这样发信号
We've got to give signals like this -

639
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:02,143
当然，声音要响些
Only louder, of course.

640
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:04,854
你必须马上走，拉尔夫
You've got to go now, Ralph.

641
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:09,942
你们愿不愿意跟我一块儿走
Won't you come with me?

642
01:23:10,736 --> 01:23:13,321
咱们三个会更有希望的
The three of us
would have a better chance.

643
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,241
快，拉尔夫
Quick, Ralph!

644
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:20,203
我就在那儿的灌木丛里，
他们绝不会想到去查这么近的地方
I'll be in that thicket there.
They won't think to look so close.

645
01:23:20,287 --> 01:23:22,664
- 是谁？谁在那儿？
- 立正
- Who is it? Who's there?
- Attention!

646
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:25,958
- 埃里克，是罗杰
- 侦查兵报告
- Eric, it's Roger.
- Scouts' report.

647
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:28,961
来，拿着这个
Here. Take this.

648
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:33,299
立正
Attention!

649
01:23:35,386 --> 01:23:36,886
侦查兵报告
Scouts' report.

650
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,072
来这里
Come here.

651
01:23:57,157 --> 01:24:00,535
取猪崽子的眼镜，我要放一把火
Got Piggy's specs?
I'll start a fire.

652
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:05,748
他一定躲在什么地方
He must be in here somewhere.
