00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,938
We shall have to put our hands up,
like we do at school.
必須像在學校裏那樣來個「舉手發言」

131
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,607
Then I'll give him the conch.
然後我給他海螺

132
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:56,570
I agree with Ralph.
We've got to have rules and obey them.
我同意拉爾夫，咱們要做些規定並遵守

133
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:59,239
After all, we're not savages.
We're English.
畢竟，我們不是野蠻人，我們是英格蘭人

134
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,741
And the English are best at everything.
英格蘭人做任何事都是最好的

135
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:06,121
So we'll have lots of rules,
and when anybody breaks them -
因此我們將會有更多的規矩，當有人打破它們——

136
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,461
- Piggy, Piggy, Piggy!
- Quiet!
- 豬崽子！豬崽子！豬崽子！
- 安靜

137
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:17,757
You're not letting Ralph
get to the most important thing.
你們不讓拉爾夫說最重要的話嗎？

138
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,428
Who knows we're here?
誰知道我們在這裏？

139
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,140
Nobody knows we're here.
沒有人知道我們在這裏

140
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,685
Perhaps they knew
where we were going to...
或許他們知道我們將要去哪裏

141
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,104
perhaps not.
或許不知道

142
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:35,233
But they don't know where we are now
'cause we never got there.
但是他們不知道我們現在在這裏，因為我們沒有到那兒

143
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,612
We might stay here till we die.
我們也許要待在這裏直到我們死去

144
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:04,095
He wants to know what you're going to do
about the snake thing.
他想知道你打算怎麼處理關於蛇的事

145
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,849
Tell us about the snake thing.
告訴我們關於蛇的事

146
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,064
Now he says it was a beastie.
現在他說這是隻野獸

147
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,857
Beastie?
野獸？

148
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:23,114
- A snake thing, ever so big. He saw it.
- When?
- 一個像蛇的東西，相當大。他看見那東西了
- 什麼時候？

149
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:30,288
When he was hiding
in the jungle in the dark.
當他躲在黑暗的叢林中時

150
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,377
He says when the rain stopped...
他說是在雨停了時

151
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:39,673
it turned into one of them things
like ropes in the trees...
它變成一個繩子一樣的東西，掛在樹上

152
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,008
and hung in the branches.
就掛在樹枝上

153
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,345
He says,
"Will it come back tonight?"
他說：「夜裏它會回來嗎？」

154
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,937
But there isn't a beastie.
但是，這兒沒有野獸

155
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,523
I tell you, there isn't a beast.
我告訴你們，這兒沒有野獸

156
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,901
Ralph's right, of course.
拉爾夫是對的，確實

157
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:04,614
There isn't a snake thing,
but if there was, we'd hunt and kill it.
沒有什麼蛇一樣的東西。
如果有，我們就抓住它，殺掉它

158
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,575
There's another thing.
還有件事

159
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,036
If a ship comes near the island,
they may not notice us.
如果附近出船隻，他們無法注意到我們

160
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:13,456
So we must make smoke on top
of the mountain. We must make a fire.
所以我們必須在山頂弄出煙來，我們需要生火

161
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,166
Come on! Follow me!
來，跟著我

162
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,419
- Yes!
- Let's go now!

- 現在就走

163
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:26,136
Just like kids -
like a crowd of kids.
真像小孩子————一群小孩子

164
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,977
I bet it's gone teatime.

165
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,867
Anybody got any matches?

My, what a big heap you've made!

我們會弄個大火堆的，它會持續一整晚

Come and give us a hand, will you?
過來幫幫忙

175

大概他指的是一種鬼魂

Blow the conch.

Of course there aren't.

They wouldn't work.
那些東西不會起作用

323
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:03,001
But suppose they wouldn't make sense,
not here on this island.

Go on being chief, Ralph.
繼續做頭頭，拉爾夫

I wish my auntie were here.

They ain't afraid of the dark.

They'd meet and have tea and discuss.

333
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,745
Then things would be all right.

334
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:47,397
- Sam.
- What's the matter?

- 怎麼了？

335
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,399

345
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,248

- Me! Me!
- 我們去抓住它，誰要去？
- 我！我！

346
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:50,544

they're made of wood. Don't be so silly.
那些長矛是用木頭做的，別傻了

- 來吧，我們走
- 誰來照顧小傢伙們？

- 豬崽子來照管他們

350
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,180
Haven't you got any sense?

How can Piggy help with only one eye?

傑克，在島上你還有什麼地方沒去過？

There's only -
Of course!

Now, this story is about
the place where I live...
故事是關於我住的地方

367
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:43,527
called Camberley.
叫Camberley

368
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:46,947
Now, Camberley is quite an old place...
Camberley是一個很安靜很老的地方

369
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:50,700
but it hasn't been called Camberley
all the time.
不過它不是一直被稱為Camberley的

370
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:54,871
It used to be called Cambridgetown.
它過去被稱為Cambridgetown

371
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:58,583
And they used to get mixed up
with the letters...
人們總是把Cambridge和Cambridgetown

372
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:02,963
between Cambridge
or Cambridgetown.
兩者搞混

373
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:07,133
So letters that were to a person
in Cambridgetown...
所以寄往Cambridgetown的人的信件

374
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:10,804
used to go to a person in Cambridge.
常被送往了Cambridge

375
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,473
So they got a bit mixed up.
人們有點混亂了

376
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:17,060
So they thought they'd change
the name at the post office...
所以他們想要改掉郵局上的名字

377
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:21,523
because it was the post office
that had all the trouble of sorting the letters.
因為郵局需要排列信件

378
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:26,903
And they thought they'd leave
the "cam" from Cambridgetown...
他們認為需要把Cambridgetown中的cam留下

379
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:28,071
and they -

380
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,656
and "ber" is a river...
「ber」指的是河

381
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,450
and there are a lot of rivers round there.
那兒周圍有很多條河

382
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:40,041
"Camber." And then "ley," because a lot
of the towns near there ended with "ley."
「Camber」，然後加上了「ley」。
因為很多城鎮名都以「ley」結尾

383
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,294
Their names ended with "ley."
它們的名字以「ley」結尾

384
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:46,006
So they called it Cam-ber-ley.
Camberley.
所以他們叫它Cam-ber-ley，Camberley

385
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,258
And that's the true story of Camberley.
這是Camberley的真實故事

386
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:03,857
I don't think we should leave Piggy
with the little uns. Not all night.
咱們不能聽憑小傢伙單跟豬崽子在一起

387
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,611
We mustn't let anything
happen to Piggy, must we?
我們不能讓豬崽子出什麼亂子，是不是？

388
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:12,866
I think someone should go back
and tell them we won't be back till after dark.
得有人去告訴他們我們天黑以後才回去

389
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,370
I'll go. I don't mind.
我去，我不在乎

390
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:18,788
Honestly.
老實說

391
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,360
We'll go to the beach.
我們去海灘

392
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,237
We can go to the top tomorrow.
我們可以明天爬上山頂

393
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,907
If you're frightened, of course.
要是你嚇壞了，那當然

394
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,159
All right then. Who wants to go now?
好吧，誰想要現在就爬山？

395
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,579
You see?
你瞧？

396
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:03,291
I'm going to climb the mountain
to look for the beast - now.
我打算上山去找野獸，現在就去

397
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:05,210
- Coming?
- I don't mind.
- 你去嗎？
- 我不在乎

398
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:07,128
If you don't mind, of course.
要是你不在乎，那當然

399
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:08,797
Not at all!
我根本不在乎

400
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:14,469
I think it's silly only two of us go.
咱們真傻，為什麼就兩個人上呢？

401
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:19,015
If we meet anything on the other side,
two won't be enough.
要是發現什麼東西，兩個人可不夠

402
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,190
All right.
Come along, Roger.
好吧，走，羅傑

403
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:47,460
If you don't want to go on,
I'll go myself.
要是你不想再上去了，我就一個人上

404
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,255
Go on then.
We'll wait here.
那就去吧，我們在這兒等著

405
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:02,767
Shut up.
閉嘴

406
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,652
I saw a thing on top.
我看到山上有個東西

407
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:16,239
There was a noise too.
Kind of "plop."
發出嘈雜聲，一種「噗噗」的響聲

408
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,892
Keep close to the ground.
貼近地面

409
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:53,651
Over there, gap in the rock.
那邊，被石頭擋住了

410
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,688
First, you know now
we've seen the beast.
首先, 你們知道現在我們看見了野獸

411
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:35,777
We crawled up.
We were only a few feet away.
我們爬過去了，我們在野獸幾英尺以外

412
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,987
The beast sat up and looked at us.
那野獸坐了起來看著我們

413
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:42,492
I don't think we could fight a thing
that size. Honestly, you know.
我不認為我們能打敗它，老實說，你知道的

414
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:46,496
We're talk,
but we couldn't fight a tiger.
我們談談，我們不能去攻擊老虎什麼的

415
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,583
We'd hide.
Even Jack would hide.
咱們會躲起來，連傑克都會躲起來

416
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:54,003
- What about my hunters?
- Boys armed with sticks?
- 我們的獵人怎麼樣？
- 那些拿木棒作武器的孩子們？

417
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,380
All right then.
好了，那麼

418
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:00,969
He's not a hunter.
He'd never have got us meat.
他不是一個獵人，
他從來沒有為我們弄到肉

419
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:04,764
He's just giving orders,
expects people to obey for nothing.
他只知發佈命令，想要大家遵守

420
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:07,642
He's like Piggy.
He says things like Piggy.
他就像豬崽子，說話都像豬崽子

421
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,686
He's not a proper chief.
He's a coward.
他不是個真正的頭頭，他是個孬種

422
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,730
On top, when Roger and me went on,
he stayed back.
在山頂上，羅傑和我朝前的時候，他賴在後面

423
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:14,983
- I went too.
- After.
- 我也上了！
- 那是後來

424
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:18,486
I went on too, then I went away.
So did you.
我也上去了，後來我跑了，你也跑了

425
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,947
Call me a coward then.
All this talk.
還叫我膽小鬼，扯淡

426
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,241
- All this talk, talk, talk.
- Right.
- 這一切扯淡，扯淡，扯淡！
- 那好吧

427
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:26,286
I'm not gonna be part of Ralph's lot.
我不想跟拉爾夫同命運

428
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:30,623
I'm going off by myself to the rocks
to hunt and have feasts and have fun.
我要獨自走開，去打獵吃肉，痛痛快快地玩

429
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,668
Anyone who wants can come too.
還有誰要走？

430
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,213
Jack!
傑克！

431
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:11,331
I said we could do
without a certain person.
我說我們少一個人也能幹

432
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:14,125
Now I think we've got to decide.
我認為現在我們要下決心

433
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,586
We can do without Jack Merridew.
沒有傑克梅瑞狄咱們也能幹

434
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,839
There's others besides him
on this island.
島上除了他還有別人呢

435
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:22,425
But now we've really got a beast -
但是現在我們真的發現了一隻野獸

436
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:25,178
though I can hardly believe it -
雖然我很難相信

437
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,431
we'll need to stay close
to the platform.
咱們必須靠近平台待著

438
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:34,020
I've been talking, Ralph.
我一直在跟你說話，拉爾夫

439
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,355
What?
什麼？

440
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:38,024
We've got no fire on the mountain...
咱們山上的火堆是沒了

441
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:41,277
but what's wrong
with a fire down here?
可是在下面這兒搞一個火堆又有什麼不好呢？

442
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:46,282
That's a good idea. We can build it
right here between the shelters.
好主意，我們可以在棚屋之間築個火堆

443
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:49,702
I think we ought
to climb the mountain.
我認為咱們該爬上山去

444
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,788
What's the use?
那又怎麼辦呢？

445
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,380
What else is there to do?
還有其他的什麼要做的？

446
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,940
And put some dry leaves on.
Make sure they're dry.
放上些干葉子，確保他們是乾的

447
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:03,359
So it'll burn.
那才會燒著

448
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:05,570
If they're wet,
it won't burn properly.
如果是潮濕的，就不會正常燃燒

449
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:41,939
Come on.
快

450
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,441
Come on.
快

451
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:55,555
Now!
上！

452
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,395
Right up the ass.
正中屁股

453
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:05,374
Sharpen a stick at both ends.
弄一根木棒，把兩頭削尖

454
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:35,112
This head is for the beast.
這個豬頭是獻給野獸的

455
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:36,697
It's a gift.
豬頭是供品

456
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:49,377
Can't they see?
Don't they understand?
難道他們就看不出？
難道他們就不明白？

457
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:55,258
Unless we keep the smoke burning,
we'll die.
沒有煙作信號，咱們就會死在這兒

458
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:00,763
What's wrong, Piggy?
怎麼了，豬崽子？

459
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:06,102
Why are things going wrong like they are?
為什麼事情會出錯？

460
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:10,022
I don't know, Ralph.
我不知道，拉爾夫

461
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:05,805
Looks like we're going to have
a lot of rain, all right.
就要下傾盆大雨了

462
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:08,391
What about the fire?
火堆怎麼樣呢？

463
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:26,409
Hey, come back! That was a mean trick!
嘿，回來，這是個卑鄙詭計

464
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:30,371
We would have given it to you if you asked.
如果你要的話，我們會給你的

465
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,438
Wee-wah-wo-wee.

466
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:59,442
Wee-wah-wo-wee.
Wee-wah-wo-wee.

467
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:52,703
Take 'em some food.
給他們點吃的

468
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,214
Bananas!
香蕉！

469
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:08,385
Wee-wah-woo-wo!

470
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:11,972
Wee-wah-woo-wo!
Wee-wah-woo-wo!

471
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,689
Who'll join my tribe?
誰要加入我的部落？

472
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:27,488
Jack. I'll join your tribe, Jack.
傑克，我要加入你的部落，傑克

473
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:34,828
- Who'll join my tribe?
- I want to join.
- 誰要加入我的部落？
- 我加入

474
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:40,584
I gave you food, and my hunters
will protect you from the beast.
我給你們吃的，我的獵手們會保護你們免遭野獸的傷害

475
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,631
- Who'll join my tribe?
- I will, Jack.
- 誰要加入我的部落？
- 我加入，傑克

476
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:50,261
I'm chief. And what about the fire?
And I've got the conch!
我是頭頭，火堆怎麼樣？我有海螺

477
01:04:50,345 --> 01:04:53,764
You haven't got it with you.
You left it behind.
你沒帶著它，你把它丟在那兒沒有帶來

478
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:57,309
See? Clever.
明白些，放聰明點吧？

479
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,147
Anyway, the conch doesn't count
on this end of the island.
海螺在島的這一頭不算數

480
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:05,317
The conch counts here
and all over the island.
海螺在這個島的任何地方都算數

481
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:09,363
Who'll join my tribe?
誰要加入我的部落？

482
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:10,698
- Me, me!
- I will!
- 我，我！
- 我加入！

483
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:13,367
- Let's join Jack's tribe!
- Yeah!
- 讓我們加入傑克的部落！
- 耶！

484
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:19,373
Come away.
There's going to be trouble.
走吧，會惹出麻煩的

485
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:09,233
Kill... the... beast!

Piggy, are you the only one left?

510
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,312
There are some little uns.
還有幾個小傢伙

511
