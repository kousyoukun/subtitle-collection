1
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:42,458
Menelaus' theorem says...

2
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,712
if three points are taken
in two sides of a triangle...

3
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,215
and the third side produced
are in all three sides produced...

4
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,552
so that the product of the three
alternate segments taken in order -

5
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,824
Hi! Ouch!

6
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,369
Hey, wait for me.

7
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:50,122
I can't hardly move
with all these creeper things.

8
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,044
Them other kids must have
got scattered in the dark.

9
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,964
We ought to go and find them.

10
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:23,030
My auntie told me not to run
on account of my asthma.

11
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,324
- Asthma?
- That's right.

12
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:28,911
I was the only boy
in our school that had asthma.

13
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,002
And I've been wearing specs
since I was three.

14
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,773
- Where's the plane?
- The storm must have dragged it out to sea.

15
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,568
There must have been some kids still in it.

16
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,572
Are there any grown-ups?

17
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,492
- I don't think so.
- What's your name?

18
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,494
Ralph.

19
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,496
I don't care what they call me...

20
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,248
as long as they don't call me
what they did at school.

21
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,833
What's that?

22
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,714
- They used to call me "Piggy."
- Piggy!

23
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:06,592
As long as you don't tell the others.

24
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,223
Daddy's a commander in the navy.

25
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,561
One day, when he gets leave,
he'll come and rescue us.

26
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,798
- Aren't you coming in?
- Ooh, it's hot.

27
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,636
No. My auntie wouldn't let me -
account of my asthma.

28
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,429
Sucks to your asthma!

29
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,518
You can't half swim well.

30
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,791
- Hey, look.
- It's a shell.

31
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:24,753
I've seen one like it before
on someone's back wall.

32
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:29,967
A conch, he called it. He used to blow it,
and then his mum would come.

33
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,725
He blew from down here.

34
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,394
You've done it!

35
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,198
Hey! Is anyone there?

36
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,545
Hey! Hey!

37
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,511
I think we ought to go and explore a bit.

38
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,598
- What's your name?
- Percival Williams Madison...

39
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,643
the Vicarage, Hartcourt, St. Anthony.

40
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,229
Telephone: Hartcourt 241.

41
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,982
- And what's your name?
- George.

42
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,238
- What's your name?
- Sam and Eric.

43
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:36,492
Sam and Eric.

44
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,806
Choir, halt!

45
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,810
Where's the man with the trumpet?

46
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,438
There's no man with a trumpet.
Only me.

47
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,940
- Isn't there a man here?
- No.

48
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,609
Then we'll have to look after ourselves.

49
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,738
We're having a meeting.
Come and join us.

50
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,907
Is he all right?

51
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,036
Take him out of the sun.
Put him in the shade, quick!

52
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,883
- All right. Let him alone.
- But, Merridew -

53
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,262
He'll be all right.
Simon's always throwing a faint.

54
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,765
Now let's decide
what we're going to do.

55
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:27,936
That's why Ralph made a meeting -
so as we can decide what to do.

56
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,314
We got most names.

57
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,692
Those two - they're twins.
Sam and Eric.

58
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,652
- I'm Sam.
- I'm Eric.

59
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,363
I'm Ralph.

60
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,949
- And you?
- Douglas.

61
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,117
Robin.

62
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,078
- Yours?
- Charles.

63
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,623
And what are all your names?

64
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,832
Henry.

65
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,003
Maurice.

66
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,673
Robert.

67
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,136
Rupert.

68
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,641
Harold.

69
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,978
Bill.

70
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,066
Roger.

71
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,864
- Simon.
- I'm Jack.

72
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,576
- And that boy there. He -
- You're talking too much.

73
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,287
- Shut up, Fatty!
- His name's not Fatty.

74
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,748
- His real name's Piggy.
- Piggy!

75
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,560
We've got to decide
about being rescued.

76
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,521
I think we ought to have
a chief to decide things.

77
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,357
Yeah, someone must take charge.

78
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,317
- I ought to be chief.
- Him with the shell!

79
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:01,029
- He got us together.
- I'm chief chorister and head boy.

80
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:05,576
Let's have a vote.

81
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,703
All right. We'll have a vote.

82
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,414
Who wants Jack for chief then?

83
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,010
- Who wants me?
- Me!

84
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,345
- Me!
- Me!

85
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,389
Me. Me.

86
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,652
I'm chief then.

87
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:49,077
Jack's in charge of the choir.
What do you want them to be?

88
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,372
Hunters.

89
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,626
Choir, take off your togs.

90
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,842
Hey, what are you wearing
those funny clothes for?

91
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:08,096
It's our uniform.

92
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,440
Listen, everybody.
If this isn't an island...

93
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,776
we might get rescued straightaway.

94
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,945
So we've got to decide if it is.

95
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,656
Three of us will go
on an expedition to find out.

96
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,116
I'll go...

97
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,910
and Jack.

98
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,704
- And -
- Take me. Please.

99
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,873
You. You all right now?

100
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,963
- I'll come.
- We don't want you. Three's enough.

101
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,757
I was with him
when he found the conch.

102
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,094
I was with him
before anyone else was.

103
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:58,647
- You can't come.
- You told them after what I said -

104
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,150
after I said I didn't want -

105
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,152
What on earth are you talking about?

106
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,655
About being called Piggy.

107
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:11,243
I said I didn't care
as long as they didn't call me Piggy.

108
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,996
And I said not to tell.

109
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,082
And then you went
and said straight out -

110
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,668
Better Piggy than Fatty.

111
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,421
And anyway,
I'm sorry if you feel like that.

112
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:26,383
Go back, Piggy, and take names.
That's your job. So long.

113
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,067
Hey, look!

114
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,573
One, two, three.

115
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,408
Heave!

116
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,079
Heave!

117
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,476
We're on an uninhabited island.

118
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,312
We shall have to look after ourselves.

119
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,734
But it's a good island.
There's lots of fruit, water...

120
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,904
and I'm pretty sure there aren't
any dangerous animals.

121
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,989
So things aren't so bad.

122
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,034
None of us are hurt.

123
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,954
There isn't any danger...

124
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,499
and we can build shelters
and be comfortable.

125
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,879
So if we're sensible,
if we do things properly...

126
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:36,049
if we don't lose our head,
we'll be all right.

127
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,595
- But where will we sleep?
- We'll build shelters.

128
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,764
We can have smashing fun.

129
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,601
And another thing.
We can't have everybody talking at once.

130
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,938
We shall have to put our hands up,
like we do at school.

131
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,607
Then I'll give him the conch.

132
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:56,570
I agree with Ralph.
We've got to have rules and obey them.

133
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:59,239
After all, we're not savages.
We're English.

134
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,741
And the English are best at everything.

135
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:06,121
So we'll have lots of rules,
and when anybody breaks them -

136
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,461
- Piggy, Piggy, Piggy!
- Quiet!

137
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:17,757
You're not letting Ralph
get to the most important thing.

138
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,428
Who knows we're here?

139
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,140
Nobody knows we're here.

140
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,685
Perhaps they knew
where we were going to...

141
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,104
perhaps not.

142
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:35,233
But they don't know where we are now
'cause we never got there.

143
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,612
We might stay here till we die.

144
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:04,095
He wants to know what you're going to do
about the snake thing.

145
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,849
Tell us about the snake thing.

146
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,064
Now he says it was a beastie.

147
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,857
Beastie?

148
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:23,114
- A snake thing, ever so big. He saw it.
- When?

149
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:30,288
When he was hiding
in the jungle in the dark.

150
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,377
He says when the rain stopped...

151
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:39,673
it turned into one of them things
like ropes in the trees...

152
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,008
and hung in the branches.

153
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,345
He says,
"Will it come back tonight?"

154
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,937
But there isn't a beastie.

155
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,523
I tell you, there isn't a beast.

156
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,901
Ralph's right, of course.

157
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:04,614
There isn't a snake thing,
but if there was, we'd hunt and kill it.

158
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,575
There's another thing.

159
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,036
If a ship comes near the island,
they may not notice us.

160
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:13,456
So we must make smoke on top
of the mountain. We must make a fire.

161
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,166
Come on! Follow me!

162
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,419
- Yes!
- Let's go now!

163
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:26,136
Just like kids -
like a crowd of kids.

164
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,977
I bet it's gone teatime.

165
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,867
Anybody got any matches?

166
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,792
My, what a big heap you've made!

167
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,003
Piggy's specs!
Come on!

168
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,057
Get out of the light!

169
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,934
Roger. Hey, Roger.
Come on over here.

170
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,411
My specs!

171
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,961
Ralph, I'll split up my choir -
my hunters, that is -

172
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,714
and we'll be responsible
for keeping the fire going.

173
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:51,262
We'll make a big blaze now.
It'll last all night.

174
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,019
Come and give us a hand, will you?

175
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,658
Attention!

176
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,926
Here comes one.

177
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,804
This is a nice one.

178
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,485
Just a minute. Be careful.

179
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:34,908
Go!

180
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,577
No!

181
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,455
- You're gonna hit me, huh?
- No, this isn't gonna hit you!

182
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,873
Ooh!

183
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,792
Come on, come on! Come on!

184
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,820
Kill! Kill! Kill!

185
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,617
No throwing sand!

186
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:53,713
Ralph, come here! It's a plane!

187
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,840
A plane! A plane!

188
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:59,719
Can't you hear it? Ralph, it's going!
Hurry up! Ralph!

189
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,975
I can't see no smoke.
Where is it?

190
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,896
Smoke.

191
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,900
Piggy's glasses!
If the fire's out, we'll need them!

192
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:38,091
Stop! Come back!
Come back!

193
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:42,261
Come back! Come back!

194
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,782
They've let the bloody fire out!

195
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,499
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

196
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,960
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

197
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:15,503
Hey, Ralph!

198
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,088
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

199
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,173
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!

200
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,843
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

201
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,512
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

202
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,181
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

203
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,976
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

204
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,437
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

205
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,356
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

206
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,025
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

207
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,736
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

208
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:44,574
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in! Kill the pig!

209
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:47,410
Look. We killed a pig!
We stole up on it. We got in a circle -

210
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,454
You let the fire out.

211
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,249
We can light it up again.

212
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,342
You should have been with us, Ralph.

213
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,636
There was lots of blood.
You should have seen it.

214
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:09,765
There was a plane.
There was a plane!

215
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:14,896
They might have seen us.
We might have gone home!

216
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:30,328
You and your blood, Jack Merridew!

217
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:33,414
You and your hunting!
We might have gone home!

218
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:35,416
We needed meat.

219
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,547
You didn't
ought to have let the fire go out!

220
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,596
My specs!

221
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,225
Here. Here they are.

222
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:15,206
Just you wait!

223
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,543
That was a dirty trick.

224
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:21,587
All right, all right.
I'm sorry!

225
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,881
About the fire, I mean.

226
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,841
There.

227
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,719
I apologize.

228
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,015
Light the fire then.

229
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,017
Choir!

230
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,152
- Piggy.
- No, Ralph, don't! Please!

231
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,196
I'll bring them back.

232
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,672
- Will it swell up his legs?
- Give me a nice piece!

233
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,841
Give me a leg, will ya?

234
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,884
- Give it to me.
- Give me a piece, please.

235
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,103
Aren't I havin' none?

236
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,272
You didn't hunt.

237
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:07,318
No more did Ralph.
No more did Simon.

238
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,618
Eat, damn you!

239
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:33,052
- Kill the pig!
- Oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink.

240
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:37,473
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

241
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,267
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

242
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,187
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

243
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,065
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

244
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,984
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

245
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,653
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat!

246
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,321
Quiet!

247
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:56,158
Get down on the beach.
I'm calling an assembly.

248
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,840
Things are beginning to break up.

249
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,344
I don't know why.

250
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,305
It all began well.

251
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,976
Then people started forgetting
what really matters.

252
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:28,607
The most important thing
for all of us...

253
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,735
is getting rescued.

254
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,824
So now let's discuss who does what,
and when we have decided...

255
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,661
we can start again...

256
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,623
and be careful
about things like the fire.

257
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:49,170
All right, so the fire went out.

258
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:52,089
But we're hunters.
We got you meat.

259
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:53,883
And if there is a beast...

260
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:56,802
it's my hunters
who will protect you from it.

261
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,359
What's your name?

262
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,528
What's your name? What's your name?

263
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,530
What's your name? What's your name?

264
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,533
What's your name?
What's your name? What's your name?

265
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,660
What's your name? What's your name?
What's your name?

266
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:24,622
Quiet! Quiet!

267
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,793
What's your name?

268
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,588
Percival Williams Madison,
the Vicarage...

269
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,382
Hartcourt, St. Anthony.

270
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:40,971
Telephone -

271
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,143
Tele -

272
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,033
Ready?

273
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,608
What did he say?

274
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,610
He says there's a beast.

275
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,904
It comes out of the sea.

276
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:04,597
My daddy said they haven't found
all the animals in the sea.

277
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:08,058
My daddy says there are animals -

278
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:10,686
What do you call them?

279
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,898
They make ink
and are hundreds of feet long...

280
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,941
and eat whales whole.

281
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:19,403
A squid can't come out of the water.

282
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,546
Maybe he means
it's some sort of ghost.

283
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:41,091
Maybe that's
what the beast is - a ghost.

284
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:51,977
I don't believe in no ghosts. Ever.

285
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:55,481
Who cares what you believe, Fatty?

286
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:02,488
Maybe there is a beast.

287
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:05,366
Hear him. He's got the conch.

288
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,206
What I mean is...

289
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,459
maybe it's only us.

290
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,962
Nuts!

291
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,971
We should have left all this till daylight.

292
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,015
We're tired.

293
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:35,646
We'll have a vote -
on ghosts, I mean -

294
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,274
and then go back
to the shelters.

295
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,654
Who thinks there may be ghosts?

296
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:07,261
- I see.
- I didn't vote for no ghosts.

297
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,930
Remember that, all of you.

298
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:13,475
- You shut up, you fat slug!
- I got the conch!

299
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,686
Oh, Jack, let him speak.
He's got the conch.

300
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,106
And you shut up. Who are you anyway,
just sitting there, telling people what to do?

301
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,067
- You can't hunt. You can't sing.
- I'm chief. I was chosen.

302
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:24,945
Why should choosing make any difference,
telling people what to do?

303
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,824
- Piggy's got the conch.
- That's right. Favor Piggy as you always do.

304
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,243
- Jack!
- "Jack!" "Jack!"

305
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,579
- The rules. You're breaking the rules!
- Who cares?

306
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,956
Because the rules are
the only thing we've got.

307
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,459
Bollocks to the rules!
We're strong. We hunt.

308
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,378
If there's a beast,
we'll hunt it down and beat and beat!

309
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:53,724
What's grown-ups going to say?
Look at 'em!

310
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:59,396
I think I ought to give up being chief.

311
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:04,693
You can't, Ralph. Not now.

312
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,738
Blow the conch.

313
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:12,409
You've got to be tough.
Make them do what you want.

314
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,791
If I blow the conch...

315
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,335
and they don't come back...

316
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,587
then we've had it.

317
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:40,604
Are there ghosts, Piggy?
Or beasts?

318
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,689
Of course there aren't.

319
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:47,611
- Why not?
- Because things wouldn't make sense.

320
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,781
Houses and streets...

321
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,034
and TV.

322
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,036
They wouldn't work.

323
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:03,001
But suppose they wouldn't make sense,
not here on this island.

324
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,048
Supposing things are watching us...

325
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,092
and waiting.

326
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,720
Go on being chief, Ralph.

327
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:17,266
- Who's there?
- Me, Simon.

328
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,022
I wish my auntie were here.

329
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:26,650
Oh, what's the use?

330
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,070
Grown-ups know things.

331
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,531
They ain't afraid of the dark.

332
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:36,243
They'd meet and have tea and discuss.

333
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,745
Then things would be all right.

334
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:47,397
- Sam.
- What's the matter?

335
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,399
Shh!

336
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:16,551
- It was furry.
- There was something moving...

337
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:19,763
behind his head - wings.

338
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:22,849
It sort of sat up.

339
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,851
It had eyes...

340
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,062
teeth, claws.

341
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:32,234
We ran as fast as we could,
bashed into things.

342
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,528
The beast followed us.

343
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,405
Nearly caught me.

344
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:41,368
You're not pulling our legs, are you?

345
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,248
- We'll hunt it. Who'll come?
- Me! Me!

346
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:50,544
But those sticks -
they're made of wood. Don't be so silly.

347
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,505
- Frightened?
- Of course I am. Who wouldn't be?

348
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,591
- Come on. Let's go.
- Who'll mind the little ones?

349
00:43:56,676 --> 00:44:00,178
- Piggy will look after them.
- That's right. Keep Piggy out of danger.

350
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,180
Haven't you got any sense?

351
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,683
How can Piggy help with only one eye?

352
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:11,565
Jack, is there anywhere
on this island where we haven't been?

353
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,567
There's only -
Of course!

354
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,278
The tail end part,
where the rocks pile up.

355
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:07,204
I'm chief. I'll go on alone.

356
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:10,207
The rest of you wait here and hide.

357
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,923
Do you think -

358
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:21,134
I've been all over.
It must be here.

359
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:32,104
I... don't believe in the beast.

360
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,816
I suppose not.

361
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,803
Couldn't let you do it on your own.

362
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:14,164
What a place for a fort!

363
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:24,925
The beast isn't here.

364
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:27,636
Let's get the others and go on to the top.

365
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,054
Oi!

366
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:40,982
Now, this story is about
the place where I live...

367
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:43,527
called Camberley.

368
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:46,947
Now, Camberley is quite an old place...

369
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:50,700
but it hasn't been called Camberley
all the time.

370
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:54,871
It used to be called Cambridgetown.

371
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:58,583
And they used to get mixed up
with the letters...

372
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:02,963
between Cambridge
or Cambridgetown.

373
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:07,133
So letters that were to a person
in Cambridgetown...

374
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:10,804
used to go to a person in Cambridge.

375
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,473
So they got a bit mixed up.

376
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:17,060
So they thought they'd change
the name at the post office...

377
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:21,523
because it was the post office
that had all the trouble of sorting the letters.

378
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:26,903
And they thought they'd leave
the "cam" from Cambridgetown...

379
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:28,071
and they -

380
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,656
and "ber" is a river...

381
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,450
and there are a lot of rivers round there.

382
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:40,041
"Camber." And then "ley," because a lot
of the towns near there ended with "ley."

383
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,294
Their names ended with "ley."

384
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:46,006
So they called it Cam-ber-ley.
Camberley.

385
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,258
And that's the true story of Camberley.

386
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:03,857
I don't think we should leave Piggy
with the little uns. Not all night.

387
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,611
We mustn't let anything
happen to Piggy, must we?

388
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:12,866
I think someone should go back
and tell them we won't be back till after dark.

389
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,370
I'll go. I don't mind.

390
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:18,788
Honestly.

391
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,360
We'll go to the beach.

392
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,237
We can go to the top tomorrow.

393
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,907
If you're frightened, of course.

394
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,159
All right then. Who wants to go now?

395
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,579
You see?

396
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:03,291
I'm going to climb the mountain
to look for the beast - now.

397
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:05,210
- Coming?
- I don't mind.

398
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:07,128
If you don't mind, of course.

399
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:08,797
Not at all!

400
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:14,469
I think it's silly only two of us go.

401
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:19,015
If we meet anything on the other side,
two won't be enough.

402
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,190
All right.
Come along, Roger.

403
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:47,460
If you don't want to go on,
I'll go myself.

404
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,255
Go on then.
We'll wait here.

405
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:02,767
Shut up.

406
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,652
I saw a thing on top.

407
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:16,239
There was a noise too.
Kind of "plop."

408
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,892
Keep close to the ground.

409
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:53,651
Over there, gap in the rock.

410
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,688
First, you know now
we've seen the beast.

411
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:35,777
We crawled up.
We were only a few feet away.

412
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,987
The beast sat up and looked at us.

413
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:42,492
I don't think we could fight a thing
that size. Honestly, you know.

414
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:46,496
We're talk,
but we couldn't fight a tiger.

415
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,583
We'd hide.
Even Jack would hide.

416
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:54,003
- What about my hunters?
- Boys armed with sticks?

417
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,380
All right then.

418
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:00,969
He's not a hunter.
He'd never have got us meat.

419
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:04,764
He's just giving orders,
expects people to obey for nothing.

420
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:07,642
He's like Piggy.
He says things like Piggy.

421
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,686
He's not a proper chief.
He's a coward.

422
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,730
On top, when Roger and me went on,
he stayed back.

423
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:14,983
- I went too.
- After.

424
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:18,486
I went on too, then I went away.
So did you.

425
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,947
Call me a coward then.
All this talk.

426
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,241
- All this talk, talk, talk.
- Right.

427
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:26,286
I'm not gonna be part of Ralph's lot.

428
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:30,623
I'm going off by myself to the rocks
to hunt and have feasts and have fun.

429
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,668
Anyone who wants can come too.

430
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,213
Jack!

431
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:11,331
I said we could do
without a certain person.

432
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:14,125
Now I think we've got to decide.

433
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,586
We can do without Jack Merridew.

434
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,839
There's others besides him
on this island.

435
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:22,425
But now we've really got a beast -

436
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:25,178
though I can hardly believe it -

437
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,431
we'll need to stay close
to the platform.

438
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:34,020
I've been talking, Ralph.

439
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,355
What?

440
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:38,024
We've got no fire on the mountain...

441
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:41,277
but what's wrong
with a fire down here?

442
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:46,282
That's a good idea. We can build it
right here between the shelters.

443
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:49,702
I think we ought
to climb the mountain.

444
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,788
What's the use?

445
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,380
What else is there to do?

446
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,940
And put some dry leaves on.
Make sure they're dry.

447
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:03,359
So it'll burn.

448
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:05,570
If they're wet,
it won't burn properly.

449
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:41,939
Come on.

450
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,441
Come on.

451
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:55,555
Now!

452
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,395
Right up the ass.

453
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:05,374
Sharpen a stick at both ends.

454
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:35,112
This head is for the beast.

455
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:36,697
It's a gift.

456
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:49,377
Can't they see?
Don't they understand?

457
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:55,258
Unless we keep the smoke burning,
we'll die.

458
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:00,763
What's wrong, Piggy?

459
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:06,102
Why are things going wrong like they are?

460
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:10,022
I don't know, Ralph.

461
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:05,805
Looks like we're going to have
a lot of rain, all right.

462
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:08,391
What about the fire?

463
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:26,409
Hey, come back! That was a mean trick!

464
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:30,371
We would have given it to you if you asked.

465
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,438
Wee-wah-wo-wee.

466
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:59,442
Wee-wah-wo-wee.
Wee-wah-wo-wee.

467
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:52,703
Take 'em some food.

468
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,214
Bananas!

469
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:08,385
Wee-wah-woo-wo!

470
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:11,972
Wee-wah-woo-wo!
Wee-wah-woo-wo!

471
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,689
Who'll join my tribe?

472
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:27,488
Jack. I'll join your tribe, Jack.

473
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:34,828
- Who'll join my tribe?
- I want to join.

474
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:40,584
I gave you food, and my hunters
will protect you from the beast.

475
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,631
- Who'll join my tribe?
- I will, Jack.

476
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:50,261
I'm chief. And what about the fire?
And I've got the conch!

477
01:04:50,345 --> 01:04:53,764
You haven't got it with you.
You left it behind.

478
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:57,309
See? Clever.

479
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,147
Anyway, the conch doesn't count
on this end of the island.

480
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:05,317
The conch counts here
and all over the island.

481
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:09,363
Who'll join my tribe?

482
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:10,698
- Me, me!
- I will!

483
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:13,367
- Let's join Jack's tribe!
- Yeah!

484
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:19,373
Come away.
There's going to be trouble.

485
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:09,233
Kill... the... beast!

486
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:11,568
Kill the beast!
Kill the pig!

487
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:14,279
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

488
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:18,367
Kill the beast!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

489
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:21,620
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

490
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:24,832
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

491
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:27,960
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

492
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,713
- Kill the pig!
- Kill the pig!

493
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:44,643
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

494
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:47,146
Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!

495
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,982
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

496
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,651
Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!

497
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:54,987
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

498
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,614
Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!

499
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,825
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

500
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:02,286
Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!

501
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:04,371
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat!

502
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:09,168
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

503
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:11,670
Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!

504
01:08:11,755 --> 01:08:14,757
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

505
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:16,341
Look!

506
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:19,970
The beast!

507
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,839
Kill! Kill!

508
01:08:55,924 --> 01:08:58,217
Kill! Kill! Kill!

509
01:11:09,432 --> 01:11:12,768
Piggy, are you the only one left?

510
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,312
There are some little uns.

511
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:18,357
They don't count.
No big uns?

512
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:23,445
Oh, Sam and Eric.
They're collecting wood.

513
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:27,115
- Nobody else?
- Not that I know of.

514
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:44,758
Piggy.

515
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:50,013
- Piggy.
- Huh?

516
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:52,140
That was murder.

517
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:57,270
You stop it!
What good are you doing talking like that?

518
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:02,776
It was dark!
There was that bloody dance!

519
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:06,113
There was thunder
and lightning and rain!

520
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:08,907
We were scared!

521
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:13,245
It wasn't... what you said.

522
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:15,205
Oh, Piggy!

523
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:18,709
It was an accident.

524
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:28,093
He was batty.

525
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,555
He asked for it.
It was an accident.

526
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,852
Oh, God, I want to go home.

527
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:42,274
Ow!

528
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,861
Ow!

529
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,031
Take him away!

530
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,048
Tomorrow, I'll hunt again.

531
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,052
Then we'll leave another head
for the beast.

532
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:21,313
Some of you will stay
and defend the gate.

533
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:25,150
The beast may try and come in.

534
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,408
Remember how he crawled?

535
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:36,620
He came disguised.

536
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:39,331
The beast may try and come...

537
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:42,793
even though we gave him
the head of our kill to eat.

538
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:45,087
So watch and be careful.

539
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:51,259
But didn't we -
Didn't we -

540
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:56,348
No. How could we kill it?

541
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:05,440
He told us.
The beast was disguised.

542
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:11,071
Tomorrow, when we get meat,
we'll have a feast.

543
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:15,534
- Chief?
- Yes, Bill?

544
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:17,619
What'll we use to light the fire?

545
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:21,081
We'll get fire from the others.

546
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:26,044
We've got to get out of this.

547
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:28,046
What do you mean?

548
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:29,840
Get rescued.

549
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:32,634
I mean it.

550
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:37,347
If we don't get out of here soon,
we'll be barmy.

551
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:40,183
- Round the bend.
- Crackers.

552
01:14:48,693 --> 01:14:51,862
Have you written a letter
to your auntie lately?

553
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:54,322
I don't know where she is now...

554
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:57,492
and I haven't got
an envelope or a stamp...

555
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:01,413
and there isn't
a pillar-box or a postman.

556
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,334
I haven't said anything very funny.

557
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:15,886
Piggy-y-y-y!

558
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,555
Piggy!

559
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:22,809
Don't make a sound.

560
01:15:22,894 --> 01:15:25,395
We're going to get you, Piggy.

561
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:29,191
Piggy?

562
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:32,736
Where are you, Piggy?

563
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:36,031
We've come to get you.

564
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:50,378
Ow! Ow! Ow!

565
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:06,895
Piggy, you've changed!

566
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:09,481
Piggy!

567
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:24,097
I just take the conch to say this.

568
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,684
I can't see without my glasses...

569
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:30,645
and I got to get them back.

570
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:33,315
What are we going to do?

571
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:57,505
Hey! Who goes there?

572
01:17:57,590 --> 01:18:00,425
Stop being silly!
You can see who I am!

573
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:19,486
I'm calling an assembly!

574
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:21,905
- Boo! Boo!
- Ow.

575
01:18:30,373 --> 01:18:33,041
Don't leave me, Ralph!

576
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:39,047
You sit down
and wait for me. Here.

577
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:47,889
What do you want?

578
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:52,268
Go away, Ralph.
You keep to your end.

579
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:57,357
This is my end and my tribe.
You have to leave me alone.

580
01:18:57,441 --> 01:19:01,027
You took Piggy's specs.
You've got to give them back.

581
01:19:01,529 --> 01:19:04,072
Got to? Who says?

582
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:07,659
I say! That was a dirty trick.

583
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:10,203
We would have given you fire
if you asked for it.

584
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:12,872
But you didn't.
You came sneaking up like a thief.

585
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:16,167
- Say that again.
- Thief! Thief!

586
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:17,919
Who's a thief?

587
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:20,422
You are!

588
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:25,844
Ralph!
Remember what we came for.

589
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:28,638
The fire. My specs.

590
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:31,850
Don't you see? There may be
a ship out there or a plane!

591
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:42,235
- Grab 'em!
- Jack!

592
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:44,654
Tie 'em up!

593
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:50,410
See? They do what I want.

594
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:53,538
You're a beast and a swine
and a bloody, bloody thief!

595
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:59,210
Boo! Boo!

596
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:01,963
Go, Jack! Go!

597
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:25,069
Let me speak!

598
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:27,572
I've got the conch!

599
01:20:43,506 --> 01:20:46,132
Which is it better to be?

600
01:20:46,217 --> 01:20:50,345
A pack of painted savages
like you are...

601
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:53,765
or sensible like Ralph is?

602
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:57,060
Which is better?

603
01:20:57,144 --> 01:21:01,397
To have rules and agree,
or to hunt and kill?

604
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:14,869
Piggy!

605
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:37,285
Sam and Eric!
Hey, Sam and Eric.

606
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:39,704
It's me, Ralph.

607
01:22:43,626 --> 01:22:46,002
When they find me,
what are they going to do?

608
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:50,632
Roger sharpened a stick at both ends.

609
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:53,009
They're going to hurt you tomorrow.

610
01:22:55,763 --> 01:22:58,890
We've got to give signals like this -

611
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:02,143
Only louder, of course.

612
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:04,854
You've got to go now, Ralph.

613
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:09,942
Won't you come with me?

614
01:23:10,736 --> 01:23:13,321
The three of us
would have a better chance.

615
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,241
Quick, Ralph!

616
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:20,203
I'll be in that thicket there.
They won't think to look so close.

617
01:23:20,287 --> 01:23:22,664
- Who is it? Who's there?
- Attention!

618
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:25,958
- Eric, it's Roger.
- Scouts' report.

619
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:28,961
Here. Take this.

620
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:33,299
Attention!

621
01:23:35,386 --> 01:23:36,886
Scouts' report.

622
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,072
Come here.

623
01:23:57,157 --> 01:24:00,535
Got Piggy's specs?
I'll start a fire.

624
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:05,748
He must be in here somewhere.

625
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:09,877
You go round that way.
We'll smoke him out.

626
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:17,218
Shh. Something's moved.

627
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:20,346
Roger, come help.

628
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:25,059
Got the stick?

629
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:38,573
I told you.
He's dangerous.

630
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:45,431
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

631
01:25:45,516 --> 01:25:48,309
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

632
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:50,686
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat!

633
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:34,063
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

634
01:26:34,147 --> 01:26:37,275
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

635
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:40,611
