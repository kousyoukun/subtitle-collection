1
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:42,752
<i>If three points are taken
in two sides of a triangle,</i>

2
00:00:42,822 --> 00:00:46,485
<i>and the third side reduced,
or all three sides reduced...</i>

3
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,619
<i>so that the product of the three
alternate segments taken in order--</i>

4
00:04:38,524 --> 00:04:40,754
<i>Hi! Ouch!</i>

5
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:43,295
Hey, wait for me.

6
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:46,992
I can't hardly move
with all these creeper things.

7
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:51,962
Them other kids must have
got scattered in the dark.

8
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:55,371
We ought to go and find them.

9
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:19,961
My auntie told me not to run
on account of my asthma.

10
00:05:20,032 --> 00:05:22,227
<i>- Asthma ?
- That's right.</i>

11
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,828
I was the only boy
in our school that had asthma.

12
00:05:29,742 --> 00:05:32,939
And I've been wearing specs
since I was three.

13
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,805
<i>- Where's the plane ?
- The storm must have dragged it out.</i>

14
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:42,171
<i>There must have been
some kids still in it.</i>

15
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:46,183
<i>Are there any grown-ups ?</i>

16
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:49,119
- I don't think so.
- What's your name ?

17
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:51,122
Ralph.

18
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,124
I don't care what they call me,

19
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:56,355
as long as they don't call me
what they did at school.

20
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:58,363
What's that ?

21
00:06:59,732 --> 00:07:03,327
- They used to call me ''Piggy.''
- Piggy!

22
00:07:03,402 --> 00:07:06,200
As long as you don't
tell the others.

23
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:11,777
Daddy's a commander in the Navy.

24
00:07:14,213 --> 00:07:17,148
One day when he gets leave,
he'll come and rescue us.

25
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:48,372
<i>- Aren't you coming in ?
- Ooh, it's hot.</i>

26
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:50,472
No. My auntie wouldn't let me--
account of my asthma.

27
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,983
<i>Sucks to your asthma.</i>

28
00:07:54,186 --> 00:07:57,121
<i>You can't half swim well.</i>

29
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:20,411
<i>- Hey, look!
- It's a shell.</i>

30
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,176
<i>I've seen one like it before
on someone's back wall.</i>

31
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:29,517
<i>A conch, he called it. He used
to blow it, and his mum would come.</i>

32
00:08:34,694 --> 00:08:37,322
He blew from down here.

33
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:39,990
- You've done it!

34
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:51,776
Hey! Is anyone there ?

35
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:06,157
Hey! Hey!

36
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:14,126
- I think we ought explore a bit.

37
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,033
- What's your name ?
- Percival Williams Madison...

38
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:22,769
the Vicarage, Hartcourt,
St. Anthony, telephone: Hartcourt 241 .

39
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,610
<i>- And what's your name ?
- George.</i>

40
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:31,412
- What's your name ?
- Sam and Eric.

41
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:33,418
Sam and Eric.

42
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:36,080
Sam and Eric.

43
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:40,877
Choir, halt!

44
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:44,656
Where's the man
with the trumpet ?

45
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:47,022
There's no man
with a trumpet. Only me.

46
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:49,493
- Isn't there a man here ?
- No.

47
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:52,224
Then we'll have
to look after ourselves.

48
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:56,792
We're having a meeting.
Come and join us.

49
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:59,360
- Is he all right ?

50
00:10:59,438 --> 00:11:01,633
Put him in the shade, quick!

51
00:11:11,283 --> 00:11:15,447
<i>- Let him alone.
- But, Merridew.</i>

52
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:19,855
<i>He'll be all right.
Simon's always throwing a faint.</i>

53
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:22,826
<i>Now let's decide
what we're going to do.</i>

54
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:27,229
That's why Ralph made a meeting--
so as we can decide what to do.

55
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:29,893
We got most names.

56
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:32,767
Those two-- they're twins.
Sam and Eric.

57
00:11:32,838 --> 00:11:35,272
- I'm Sam.
- I'm Eric.

58
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:36,968
I'm Ralph.

59
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:41,508
<i>- And you ?
- Douglas.</i>

60
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,640
<i>- Yours ?
- Charles.</i>

61
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:47,379
And what are all your names ?

62
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:49,387
Henry.

63
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:52,557
Maurice.

64
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:56,227
Robert.

65
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:00,698
Wilbur.

66
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:05,703
Harold.

67
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:10,041
Bill.

68
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:14,112
Roger.

69
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,417
<i>- Simon.
- I'm Jack.</i>

70
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:24,154
- And that boy there. He--
- You're talking too much.

71
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:26,851
- Shut up, Fatty!
- His name's not Fatty.

72
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:29,360
- His real name's Piggy.
- Piggy!

73
00:12:47,112 --> 00:12:49,546
We've got to decide
about being rescued.

74
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:52,083
I think we ought to have
a chief to decide things.

75
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:54,915
<i>- Someone must take charge.
</i>

76
00:12:54,987 --> 00:12:56,921
<i>- I ought to be chief.
- Him with the shell!</i>

77
00:12:56,989 --> 00:13:01,085
<i>- He got us together.
- I'm chief chorister and head boy.</i>

78
00:13:02,194 --> 00:13:03,593
<i>- Let's have a vote.</i>

79
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:07,256
<i>All right. We'll have a vote.</i>

80
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,962
<i>- Who wants Jack for chief then ?</i>

81
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,611
<i>- Who wants me ?
- Me!</i>

82
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:24,945
- Me!
- Me!

83
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:26,951
<i>Me. Me.</i>

84
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,264
<i>I'm chief, then.</i>

85
00:13:45,137 --> 00:13:48,629
<i>Jack's in charge of the choir.
What do you want them to be ?</i>

86
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:51,942
Hunters.

87
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:54,479
<i>Choir, take off your togs.</i>

88
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:03,444
Hey, what are you wearing
those funny clothes for ?

89
00:14:03,522 --> 00:14:05,786
It's our uniform.

90
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:17,665
<i>Listen, everybody.
If this isn't an island,</i>

91
00:14:17,736 --> 00:14:19,670
we might get rescued
straightaway.

92
00:14:19,738 --> 00:14:21,672
So we've got to decide
if it is.

93
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,267
<i>Three of us will go
on an expedition to find out.</i>

94
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:29,508
I'll go and Jack.

95
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:32,311
<i>- And--
- Take me. Please.</i>

96
00:14:32,384 --> 00:14:34,477
You. You all right now ?

97
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:40,885
- I'll come.
- We don't want you. Three's enough.

98
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,326
I was with him
when he found the conch.

99
00:14:43,395 --> 00:14:46,660
I was with him
before anyone else was.

100
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:58,232
- You can't come.
- You told them after what I said--

101
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,711
after I said I didn't want--

102
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,714
What are you talking about ?

103
00:15:03,782 --> 00:15:06,216
About being called Piggy.

104
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:10,779
I said I didn't care
as long as they didn't call me Piggy.

105
00:15:10,856 --> 00:15:13,586
And I said not to tell.

106
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:16,651
And then you went
and said straight out--

107
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:19,220
- Better Piggy than Fatty.

108
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:21,994
And anyway, I'm sorry
if you feel like that.

109
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:25,935
Go back, Piggy, and take names.
That's your job. So long.

110
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:23,627
<i>Hey, look!</i>

111
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:31,158
One, two, three.

112
00:16:31,236 --> 00:16:32,965
Heave!

113
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,075
Heave!

114
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:04,553
<i>We're on an uninhabited island.</i>

115
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:08,286
<i>We shall have
to look after ourselves.</i>

116
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,126
<i>But it's a good island.
There's lots of fruit, water,</i>

117
00:19:12,197 --> 00:19:15,496
<i>and I'm pretty sure there aren't
any dangerous animals.</i>

118
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:18,468
<i>So things aren't so bad.</i>

119
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:20,471
<i>None of us are hurt.</i>

120
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,373
<i>There isn't any danger,</i>

121
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:27,037
<i>and we can build shelters
and be comfortable.</i>

122
00:19:29,314 --> 00:19:32,442
So if we're sensible--
if we do things properly--

123
00:19:32,517 --> 00:19:35,350
if we don't lose our head--
we'll be all right.

124
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:40,156
- But where will we sleep ?
- We'll build shelters.

125
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:43,194
We can have smashing fun.

126
00:19:43,262 --> 00:19:46,197
And another thing.
We can't have everybody talking at once.

127
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:51,225
We shall have to put our hands up,
then I'll give him the conch.

128
00:19:51,303 --> 00:19:54,136
<i>[Jack ]
I agree with Ralph.</i>

129
00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:56,140
We've got to have rules
and obey them.

130
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,802
After all, we're not savages.
We're English.

131
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:01,243
<i>-And the English are best at everything.</i>

132
00:20:01,313 --> 00:20:05,716
<i>So we'll have lots of rules,
and when anybody breaks them--</i>

133
00:20:10,522 --> 00:20:13,013
- Piggy, Piggy, Piggy!
- Quiet!

134
00:20:13,091 --> 00:20:17,118
You're not letting Ralph
get to the most important thing.

135
00:20:18,196 --> 00:20:21,359
Who knows we're here ?

136
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:24,732
Nobody knows we're here.

137
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:28,261
Perhaps they knew
where we were going to,

138
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,604
perhaps not.

139
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:34,669
But they don't know where we are now
'cause we never got there.

140
00:20:34,746 --> 00:20:37,681
<i>We might stay here
till we die.</i>

141
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:04,101
He wants to know what you're going to do
about the snake thing.

142
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:07,407
Tell us about
the snake thing.

143
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:13,577
Now he says
it was a beastie.

144
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:15,381
Beastie?

145
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:22,619
<i>-A snake thing, ever so big. He saw it.
- When ?</i>

146
00:21:26,198 --> 00:21:31,261
When he was hiding
in the jungle in the dark.

147
00:21:31,336 --> 00:21:34,897
<i>He says when the rain stopped,</i>

148
00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:39,171
it turned into one of them things
like ropes in the trees...

149
00:21:39,244 --> 00:21:41,576
and hung in the branches.

150
00:21:41,646 --> 00:21:44,843
He says,
''Will it come back tonight ?''

151
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:53,456
<i>But there isn't a beastie.</i>

152
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:56,016
I tell you,
there isn't a beast.

153
00:21:57,262 --> 00:21:59,321
Ralph's right, of course.

154
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:03,095
There isn't a snake thing, but
if there was, we'd hunt and kill it.

155
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,563
<i>There's another thing.
If a ship comes near,</i>

156
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:09,573
they may not notice us.

157
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:12,974
So we must make smoke on top
of the mountain. We must make a fire.

158
00:22:13,044 --> 00:22:14,671
Come on. Follow me.

159
00:22:14,746 --> 00:22:18,409
- Yes!
- Let's go now!

160
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:25,613
Just like kids--
like a crowd of kids.

161
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:33,496
I bet it's gone teatime.

162
00:22:46,445 --> 00:22:48,379
<i>Anybody got any matches ?</i>

163
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,286
My, what a big heap
you've made!

164
00:22:57,355 --> 00:22:59,516
Piggy's specs!
Come on!

165
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:11,660
<i>Get out of the light!</i>

166
00:23:11,736 --> 00:23:14,432
<i>Roger, hey, Roger.
Come on over here.</i>

167
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:32,890
My specs!

168
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:41,456
Ralph, I'll split up my choir--
my hunters, that is.

169
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:43,694
And we'll be responsible
for keeping the fire going.

170
00:23:46,938 --> 00:23:50,738
We'll make a big blaze now.
It'll last all night.

171
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,943
<i>Come and give us a hand.</i>

172
00:24:51,202 --> 00:24:53,136
Attention!

173
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:09,953
Here comes one.

174
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:14,250
This is a nice one.

175
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,971
Just a minute.
Be careful.

176
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:34,401
Go!

177
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,072
No!

178
00:25:37,148 --> 00:25:39,082
It isn't gonna hit you!

179
00:25:40,051 --> 00:25:41,382
Ooh!

180
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:44,320
Come on, come on!

181
00:27:32,931 --> 00:27:35,297
Kill! Kill!

182
00:27:38,937 --> 00:27:41,132
<i>No throwing sand!</i>

183
00:27:50,348 --> 00:27:53,215
<i>Ralph, come here! It's a plane!</i>

184
00:27:53,284 --> 00:27:54,842
A plane! A plane!

185
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:59,219
<i>Can't you hear it ? Ralph, it's going!
Hurry up! Ralph!</i>

186
00:28:01,192 --> 00:28:05,458
I can't see no smoke.
Where is it ?

187
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:10,163
Smoke.

188
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:13,398
Piggy's glasses!
If the fire's out, we'll need them!

189
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:37,584
Stop! Come back!
Come back!

190
00:28:37,662 --> 00:28:41,758
Come back! Come back!

191
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,283
They've let
the bloody fire out!

192
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:13,492
<i>Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!</i>

193
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:15,499
<i>Hey, Ralph!</i>

194
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:20,297

Kill the pig! Slit her throat!

195
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:22,635
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!

196
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:25,870
<i>Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!</i>

197
00:29:25,944 --> 00:29:29,277
<i>Bash her in! Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!</i>

198
00:29:29,347 --> 00:29:31,941
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

199
00:29:32,016 --> 00:29:35,782
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in! Kill the pig!

200
00:29:35,854 --> 00:29:38,288
Slit her throat!
Bash her in! Kill the pig!

201
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:42,349
Slit her throat! Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!

202
00:29:42,427 --> 00:29:44,361
<i>Bash her in!
Kill the pig!</i>

203
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:46,920
<i>Look. We killed a pig!
We stole up on it!</i>

204
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:48,932
You let the fire out.

205
00:29:50,768 --> 00:29:53,293
We can light it up again.

206
00:30:00,912 --> 00:30:02,846
You should have been
with us, Ralph.

207
00:30:02,914 --> 00:30:05,144
There was lots of blood!
You should have seen it.

208
00:30:05,216 --> 00:30:09,243
There was a plane.
There was a plane!

209
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:14,384
They might have seen us.
We might have gone home!

210
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:28,868
<i>You and your blood, Jack Merridew!</i>

211
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,899
You and your hunting!
We might have gone home!

212
00:30:32,977 --> 00:30:34,911
We needed meat.

213
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:41,049
<i>You didn't
ought to have let the fire go out!</i>

214
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,088
<i>- My specs!</i>

215
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,220
Here. Here they are.

216
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,684
Just you wait!

217
00:31:14,752 --> 00:31:18,051
That was a dirty trick.

218
00:31:18,122 --> 00:31:21,091
All right, all right.
I'm sorry!

219
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:23,855
About the fire, I mean.

220
00:31:23,928 --> 00:31:28,228
There. I apologize.

221
00:31:30,568 --> 00:31:32,502
Light the fire, then.

222
00:31:33,037 --> 00:31:35,505
Choir!

223
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:42,811
Piggy.

224
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,643
No, Ralph, don't! Please!

225
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:46,650
I'll bring them back.

226
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,733
<i>Will it swell up his legs ?</i>

227
00:32:03,801 --> 00:32:05,735
<i>- Give me a leg.</i>

228
00:32:06,971 --> 00:32:09,872
<i>- Give it to me.
- Give me a piece, please.</i>

229
00:32:58,289 --> 00:33:00,621
Aren't I havin' none ?

230
00:33:00,691 --> 00:33:02,784
You didn't hunt.

231
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,819
No more did Ralph.
No more did Simon.

232
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,070
Eat, damn you!

233
00:33:29,353 --> 00:33:33,517
- Kill the pig!
- Oink, oink, oink.

234
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:36,958
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

235
00:33:37,028 --> 00:33:39,758
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

236
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:42,664
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

237
00:33:42,733 --> 00:33:45,531
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

238
00:33:45,603 --> 00:33:48,163
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

239
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:50,173
<i>Kill the pig!
Slit her throat!</i>

240
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:52,175
Quiet!

241
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:56,111
Get down on the beach.
We're calling an assembly.

242
00:34:07,992 --> 00:34:11,291
<i>Things are beginning to break up.</i>

243
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:15,561
<i>I don't know why.</i>

244
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:17,794
<i>It all began well.</i>

245
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:21,430
<i>Then people started forgetting
what really matters.</i>

246
00:34:24,742 --> 00:34:29,179
The most important thing for all
of us is getting rescued.

247
00:34:32,116 --> 00:34:35,574
<i>So now let's discuss who does what,
and when we have decided,</i>

248
00:34:38,122 --> 00:34:40,989
we can start again...

249
00:34:41,058 --> 00:34:44,050
and be careful about things
like the fire.

250
00:34:45,229 --> 00:34:48,665
<i>All right, so the fire went out.</i>

251
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:51,065
<i>But we're hunters.
We got you meat.</i>

252
00:34:51,135 --> 00:34:53,365
<i>And if there is a beast,</i>

253
00:34:53,437 --> 00:34:56,270
it's my hunters who
will protect you from it.

254
00:35:09,887 --> 00:35:11,855
<i>What's your name?</i>

255
00:35:11,923 --> 00:35:15,950
<i>What's your name? What's your name?</i>

256
00:35:16,027 --> 00:35:18,018
What's your name ?

257
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:23,099
Quiet! Quiet!

258
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:28,271
What's your name ?

259
00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:32,070
Percival Williams Madison,
the Vicarage,

260
00:35:32,143 --> 00:35:34,873
Hartcourt, St. Anthony.

261
00:35:34,946 --> 00:35:38,609
Telephone--

262
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:42,084
Telephone--

263
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:45,088
<i>- Tele--</i>

264
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:32,835
<i>What did he say ?</i>

265
00:36:32,903 --> 00:36:36,066
<i>He says there's a beast.</i>

266
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,870
<i>It comes out of the sea.</i>

267
00:36:59,897 --> 00:37:05,062
My daddy said they haven't found
all the animals in the sea.

268
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:07,934
My daddy says
there are animals--

269
00:37:08,005 --> 00:37:09,996
What do you call them ?

270
00:37:10,074 --> 00:37:13,373
They make ink
and are hundreds of feet long...

271
00:37:13,444 --> 00:37:15,412
and eat whales whole.

272
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:18,812
<i>A squid can't come out of the water.</i>

273
00:37:34,398 --> 00:37:37,026
Maybe he means
it's some sort of ghost.

274
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:40,537
<i>Maybe that's
what the beast is, a ghost.</i>

275
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:51,407
I don't believe
in no ghosts. Ever.

276
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:54,918
<i>- Who cares what you believe, Fatty ?</i>

277
00:37:57,688 --> 00:38:01,954
Maybe there is a beast.

278
00:38:02,026 --> 00:38:04,824
<i>Hear him. He's got the conch.</i>

279
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:11,657
What I mean is,

280
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:14,899
maybe it's only us.

281
00:38:14,972 --> 00:38:16,906
<i>Nuts!</i>

282
00:38:23,647 --> 00:38:27,413
We should have left all this
till daylight.

283
00:38:27,485 --> 00:38:29,419
We're tired.

284
00:38:31,355 --> 00:38:36,088
We'll have a vote--
on ghosts, I mean--

285
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,720
and then go back
to the shelters.

286
00:38:40,698 --> 00:38:43,132
Who thinks there
may be ghosts ?

287
00:39:03,053 --> 00:39:06,750
<i>- I see.
- I didn't vote for no ghosts.</i>

288
00:39:06,824 --> 00:39:08,883
<i>Remember that, all of you.</i>

289
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:10,927
<i>You shut up, you fat slug!</i>

290
00:39:10,995 --> 00:39:12,963
I got the conch!

291
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,157
<i>Oh, Jack, let him speak.
He's got the conch.</i>

292
00:39:15,232 --> 00:39:17,996
And you shut up. Who are you,
telling people what to do ?

293
00:39:18,068 --> 00:39:21,435
- You can't hunt. You can't sing.
- I'm chief. I was chosen.

294
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:24,269
Why should choosing make any difference,
telling people what to do ?

295
00:39:24,341 --> 00:39:28,038
- Piggy's got the conch.
- Favor Piggy as you always do.

296
00:39:28,112 --> 00:39:30,205
-Jack!
-Jack! Jack!

297
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:33,045
- You're breaking the rules!
- Who cares ?

298
00:39:33,117 --> 00:39:35,449
Because the rules are
the only thing we've got.

299
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:37,783
Bullocks to the rules!
We're strong. We hunt.

300
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:40,050
If there's a beast,
we'll hunt it down!

301
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:53,163
What's grown-ups going
to say ? Look at 'em!

302
00:39:54,638 --> 00:39:59,337
I think I ought to
give up being chief.

303
00:40:00,744 --> 00:40:05,147
You can't, Ralph. Not now.

304
00:40:05,216 --> 00:40:09,380
Blow the conch.
You've got to be tough.

305
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:12,354
Make them do what you want.

306
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:18,261
If I blow the conch,

307
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:20,820
and they don't come back,

308
00:40:20,898 --> 00:40:23,025
then we've had it.

309
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,081
Are there ghosts, Piggy ?
Or beasts ?

310
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,516
Of course there aren't.

311
00:40:42,586 --> 00:40:46,044
- Why not ?
- Because things wouldn't make sense.

312
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:53,493
Houses and streets...
and TV.

313
00:40:53,564 --> 00:40:55,498
They wouldn't work.

314
00:40:57,268 --> 00:41:02,467
But suppose they wouldn't make
sense, not here on this island.

315
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:07,534
Supposing things
are watching us...

316
00:41:07,611 --> 00:41:09,545
and waiting.

317
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:13,149
<i>Go on being chief, Ralph.</i>

318
00:41:13,217 --> 00:41:15,208
<i>Who's there ?</i>

319
00:41:15,286 --> 00:41:17,220
Me, Simon.

320
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:23,453
<i>I wish my auntie were here.</i>

321
00:41:23,527 --> 00:41:26,121
Oh, what's the use ?

322
00:41:27,364 --> 00:41:29,559
<i>Grown-ups know things.</i>

323
00:41:29,633 --> 00:41:32,602
<i>They ain't afraid
of the dark.</i>

324
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,730
They'd meet and have tea
and discuss.

325
00:41:35,806 --> 00:41:38,775
Then things would be
all right.

326
00:42:43,934 --> 00:42:44,866
<i>Sam.</i>

327
00:42:44,935 --> 00:42:46,869
<i>What's the matter?</i>

328
00:42:46,937 --> 00:42:48,871
Shh.

329
00:43:13,096 --> 00:43:16,793
<i>- It was furry.
- There was something moving...</i>

330
00:43:16,867 --> 00:43:19,893
<i>behind his head-- wings.</i>

331
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,461
<i>It sort of sat up.</i>

332
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:27,067
<i>It had eyes, teeth, claws.</i>

333
00:43:27,144 --> 00:43:31,945
<i>We ran as fast as we could,
bashed into things.</i>

334
00:43:32,015 --> 00:43:34,074
<i>The beast followed us.</i>

335
00:43:34,151 --> 00:43:36,381
<i>Then he caught me.</i>

336
00:43:37,287 --> 00:43:40,484
You're not pulling our legs,
are you ?

337
00:43:42,492 --> 00:43:45,723
- We'll hunt it. Who'll come ?
- Me! Me!

338
00:43:45,796 --> 00:43:49,630
But those sticks, they're made of wood.
Don't be so silly.

339
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:50,631
Frightened ?

340
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,634
Of course I am.
Who wouldn't be ?

341
00:43:52,702 --> 00:43:53,828
Come on. Let's go.

342
00:43:53,904 --> 00:43:56,065
<i>Who'll mind the little ones ?</i>

343
00:43:56,139 --> 00:43:59,631
- Piggy will.
- Right. Keep Piggy out of danger.

344
00:43:59,709 --> 00:44:01,643
Haven't you got any sense ?

345
00:44:01,711 --> 00:44:04,646
How can Piggy help
with only one eye ?

346
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:11,009
Jack, is there anywhere on this
island where we haven't been ?

347
00:44:11,088 --> 00:44:13,022
There's only--
Of course!

348
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:15,650
The tail end part,
where the rocks pile up.

349
00:45:04,074 --> 00:45:06,668
I'm chief.
I'll go in alone.

350
00:45:06,743 --> 00:45:09,678
The rest of you
wait here and hide.

351
00:45:15,218 --> 00:45:17,379
Do you think--

352
00:45:17,454 --> 00:45:20,582
I've been all over.
It must be here.

353
00:45:27,564 --> 00:45:31,557
I... don't believe
in the beast.

354
00:45:33,336 --> 00:45:35,270
I suppose not.

355
00:46:44,274 --> 00:46:46,242
Couldn't let you do it
on your own.

356
00:47:11,668 --> 00:47:13,602
What a place for a fort!

357
00:47:22,479 --> 00:47:24,413
The beast isn't here.

358
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:28,474
-Let's get the others and go to the top.
-Boys!

359
00:47:35,825 --> 00:47:40,455
Now, this story is about
the place where I live,

360
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,998
called Camberley.

361
00:47:43,066 --> 00:47:46,433
Now, Camberley is
quite an old place,

362
00:47:46,503 --> 00:47:50,166
but it hasn't been called
Camberley all the time.

363
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,267
It used to be called
Cambridgetown.

364
00:47:54,344 --> 00:47:58,041
And they used to get mixed up
with the letters...

365
00:47:58,114 --> 00:48:02,414
between Cambridge
or Cambridgetown.

366
00:48:02,485 --> 00:48:06,581
So letters that were to a person
in Cambridgetown...

367
00:48:06,656 --> 00:48:10,649
used to go to a person
in Cambridge.

368
00:48:10,727 --> 00:48:14,686
So they got a bit mixed up.
So they thought they'd change...

369
00:48:14,764 --> 00:48:17,494
the name at the post office,
because it was a post office...

370
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:21,401
that had all the trouble
of sorting the letters.

371
00:48:21,471 --> 00:48:26,374
And they thought they'd leave
the ''cam'' from Cambridgetown,

372
00:48:26,443 --> 00:48:27,535
and they--

373
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,100
''ber'' is a river,

374
00:48:29,179 --> 00:48:31,909
and there are a lot of rivers
around there.

375
00:48:31,981 --> 00:48:39,513
''Camber.'' And then ''ley,'' because often
the towns near there ended with ''ley.''

376
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:41,750
Their names ended
with ''ley.''

377
00:48:41,825 --> 00:48:45,488
So they called it
Cam-ber-ley. Camberley.

378
00:48:45,562 --> 00:48:47,689
And that's the true story
of Camberley.

379
00:48:59,743 --> 00:49:01,768
I don't think we should leave
Piggy with the little ones.

380
00:49:01,845 --> 00:49:03,335
Not all night.

381
00:49:03,413 --> 00:49:07,349
We mustn't let anything
happen to Piggy, must we ?

382
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:12,821
I think someone should go back and tell
them we won't be back till after dark.

383
00:49:14,224 --> 00:49:16,658
I'll go.
I don't mind.

384
00:49:16,726 --> 00:49:18,717
Honestly.

385
00:49:45,822 --> 00:49:48,723
We'll go to the beach.

386
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:50,726
We can go to the top tomorrow.

387
00:49:50,794 --> 00:49:53,092
If you're frightened, of course.

388
00:49:53,163 --> 00:49:55,495
All right, then.
Who wants to go now ?

389
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,065
You see ?

390
00:49:59,135 --> 00:50:01,933
I'm going to climb the mountain
to look for the beast now.

391
00:50:02,005 --> 00:50:04,405
- Coming ?
- I don't mind.

392
00:50:04,474 --> 00:50:06,533
If you don't mind, of course.

393
00:50:06,609 --> 00:50:07,940
Not at all!

394
00:50:11,047 --> 00:50:13,914
I think it's silly
only two of us go.

395
00:50:13,983 --> 00:50:18,477
If we meet anything
on the other side, two won't be enough.

396
00:50:24,093 --> 00:50:27,153
All right.
Come along, Roger.

397
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,674
If you don't want to go on,
I'll go myself.

398
00:50:46,749 --> 00:50:50,241
Go on, then.
We'll wait here.

399
00:51:00,497 --> 00:51:02,431
Shut up.

400
00:51:09,873 --> 00:51:12,137
I saw a thing on top.

401
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:15,666
There was a noise too.
Kind of...

402
00:51:40,336 --> 00:51:43,271
<i>Keep close to the ground.</i>

403
00:51:49,879 --> 00:51:53,042
<i>Over there, capping the rock.</i>

404
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:30,016
First, you know now
we've seen the beast.

405
00:52:31,521 --> 00:52:34,957
<i>We crawled up.
We were only a few feet away.</i>

406
00:52:35,024 --> 00:52:37,390
The beast sat up
and looked at us.

407
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:41,897
I don't think we could fight a thing
that size. Honestly, you know.

408
00:52:41,965 --> 00:52:45,901
We're talk.
We couldn't fight a tiger.

409
00:52:45,969 --> 00:52:49,735
We'd hide.
Even Jack would hide.

410
00:52:49,806 --> 00:52:52,900
- What about my hunters ?
- Boys armed with sticks ?

411
00:52:52,976 --> 00:52:54,705
All right, then.

412
00:52:56,679 --> 00:53:00,240
He's not a hunter.
He'd never have got us meat.

413
00:53:00,316 --> 00:53:04,082
He's just giving orders,
expects people to obey for nothing.

414
00:53:04,153 --> 00:53:06,951
<i>He's like Piggy.
He says things like Piggy.</i>

415
00:53:07,023 --> 00:53:08,991
<i>He's not a proper chief.
He's a coward.</i>

416
00:53:09,058 --> 00:53:12,027
On top, when Roger and me went on,
he stayed back.

417
00:53:12,095 --> 00:53:14,290
- I went too.
- After.

418
00:53:14,364 --> 00:53:17,765
I went on too, then I went away.
So did you.

419
00:53:17,834 --> 00:53:20,268
Call me a coward then.
All this talk.

420
00:53:20,336 --> 00:53:22,566
- All this talk, talk, talk.
- Right.

421
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:25,574
I'm not gonna be
part of Ralph's lot.

422
00:53:25,642 --> 00:53:29,942
I'm going off by myself to the rocks
to hunt and have feasts and have fun.

423
00:53:30,013 --> 00:53:32,948
Anyone who wants
can come too.

424
00:53:34,984 --> 00:53:36,918
Jack!

425
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:10,609
<i>I said we could do
without a certain person.</i>

426
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:13,417
<i>Now I think
we've got to decide.</i>

427
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:15,889
<i>We can do without Jack Merridew.</i>

428
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:19,121
<i>There's others besides him
on this island.</i>

429
00:54:19,195 --> 00:54:21,720
<i>But now we've really
got a beast--</i>

430
00:54:21,798 --> 00:54:24,494
<i>though I can hardly
believe it--</i>

431
00:54:24,567 --> 00:54:27,730
<i>we'll need to stay close
to the platform.</i>

432
00:54:30,473 --> 00:54:33,340
I've been talking, Ralph.

433
00:54:33,409 --> 00:54:34,671
What ?

434
00:54:34,744 --> 00:54:37,304
We've got no fire
on the mountain,

435
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:40,577
but what's wrong
with a fire down here ?

436
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:45,587
That's a good idea. We can build it
right here between the shelters.

437
00:54:45,655 --> 00:54:48,988
I think we ought
to climb the mountain.

438
00:54:49,058 --> 00:54:51,993
<i>What's the use ?</i>

439
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,666
What else is there to do ?

440
00:55:55,825 --> 00:56:00,262
And put some dry leaves on.
Make sure they're dry.

441
00:56:02,732 --> 00:56:05,895
<i>If they're wet,
it won't burn properly.</i>

442
00:56:39,235 --> 00:56:41,169
Come on.

443
00:57:23,246 --> 00:57:25,180
Come on.

444
00:57:52,842 --> 00:57:54,776
Now!

445
00:58:41,457 --> 00:58:43,687
Right up the ass.

446
00:59:01,577 --> 00:59:04,512
<i>Sharpen a stick at both ends.</i>

447
00:59:31,707 --> 00:59:34,403
<i>This head is for the beast.</i>

448
00:59:34,477 --> 00:59:36,707
<i>It's a gift.</i>

449
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:48,657
Can't they see ?
Don't they understand ?

450
00:59:50,893 --> 00:59:54,556
Unless we keep the smoke burning,
we'll die.

451
00:59:58,034 --> 01:00:00,662
What's wrong, Piggy ?

452
01:00:02,204 --> 01:00:05,367
Why are things going
wrong like they are ?

453
01:00:07,109 --> 01:00:09,339
I don't know, Ralph.

454
01:02:02,158 --> 01:02:05,093
Looks like we're going to have
a lot of rain, all right.

455
01:02:05,161 --> 01:02:07,686
What about the fire ?

456
01:02:22,244 --> 01:02:24,610
<i>Hey, come back!</i>

457
01:02:27,516 --> 01:02:29,643
We wouldn't go back to you--

458
01:02:52,808 --> 01:02:54,742
<i>Wee-wah-wo-wee.</i>

459
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:58,746
<i>Wee-wah-wo-wee.
Wee-wah-wo-wee.</i>

460
01:03:49,498 --> 01:03:52,797
Take 'em some food.

461
01:04:00,175 --> 01:04:02,507
<i>Bananas!</i>

462
01:04:05,914 --> 01:04:07,905
<i>Wee-wah-woo-wo!</i>

463
01:04:07,983 --> 01:04:11,248
<i>Wee-wah-woo-wo!
Wee-wah-woo-wo!</i>

464
01:04:17,526 --> 01:04:19,994
Who'll join my tribe ?

465
01:04:24,099 --> 01:04:26,761
Jack. I'll join your tribe,Jack.

466
01:04:30,773 --> 01:04:33,606
- Who'll join my tribe ?
- I will.

467
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:39,638
I gave you food, and my hunters
will protect you from the beast.

468
01:04:41,717 --> 01:04:44,948
- Who'll join my tribe ?
- I will,Jack.

469
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:49,548
I'm chief. And what about the fire ?
I've got the conch!

470
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:53,061
You haven't got it with you.
You left it behind.

471
01:04:54,663 --> 01:04:56,597
See ? Clever.

472
01:04:58,667 --> 01:05:00,965
Anyway, the conch doesn't count
on this end of the island.

473
01:05:01,036 --> 01:05:04,130
The conch counts here
and all over the island.

474
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:08,669
<i>Who'll join my tribe ?</i>

475
01:05:08,744 --> 01:05:11,008
- Me, me!
- I will!

476
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,640
- Let's join Jack's tribe!
- Yeah!

477
01:05:16,118 --> 01:05:18,643
Come away.
There's going to be trouble.

478
01:07:05,761 --> 01:07:07,922
Kill the beast!

479
01:07:07,996 --> 01:07:10,897
<i>Kill the beast!
Kill the pig!</i>

480
01:07:10,966 --> 01:07:14,561
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

481
01:07:14,636 --> 01:07:17,662
Kill the beast!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

482
01:07:17,739 --> 01:07:20,936
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

483
01:07:21,009 --> 01:07:24,137
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

484
01:07:24,213 --> 01:07:28,240
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

485
01:07:39,995 --> 01:07:43,328
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

486
01:07:43,398 --> 01:07:46,424
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

487
01:07:46,502 --> 01:07:49,266
Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!

488
01:07:49,338 --> 01:07:51,738
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

489
01:07:51,807 --> 01:07:54,275
Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!

490
01:07:54,343 --> 01:07:56,709
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

491
01:07:56,778 --> 01:07:59,144
Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!

492
01:07:59,214 --> 01:08:01,580
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

493
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:03,641
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat!

494
01:08:05,954 --> 01:08:08,445
<i>Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!</i>

495
01:08:08,524 --> 01:08:10,992
<i>Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!</i>

496
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:14,051
<i>Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!</i>

497
01:08:14,129 --> 01:08:18,759
Look! The beast!

498
01:08:53,168 --> 01:08:55,136
<i>Kill! Kill!</i>

499
01:08:55,203 --> 01:08:57,501
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

500
01:11:08,704 --> 01:11:12,071
Piggy, are you
the only one left ?

501
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,608
<i>There are some little ones.</i>

502
01:11:14,676 --> 01:11:17,645
They don't count.
No big ones ?

503
01:11:18,914 --> 01:11:22,714
<i>Oh, Sam and Eric.
They're collecting wood.</i>

504
01:11:22,784 --> 01:11:26,379
<i>- Nobody else ?
- Not that I know of.</i>

505
01:11:42,537 --> 01:11:44,471
Piggy.

506
01:11:47,175 --> 01:11:49,302
- Piggy.
- Huh ?

507
01:11:49,377 --> 01:11:51,572
That was murder.

508
01:11:51,646 --> 01:11:56,208
You stop it! What good are you
doing talking like that ?

509
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:02,079
It was dark!
There was that bloody dance!

510
01:12:02,157 --> 01:12:05,888
There was thunder
and lightning and rain!

511
01:12:05,961 --> 01:12:08,225
We were scared!

512
01:12:08,296 --> 01:12:12,528
It wasn't...
what you said.

513
01:12:12,601 --> 01:12:14,933
Oh, Piggy!

514
01:12:16,004 --> 01:12:19,030
It was an accident.

515
01:12:25,313 --> 01:12:27,372
He was batty.

516
01:12:27,449 --> 01:12:30,782
He asked for it.
It was an accident.

517
01:12:33,488 --> 01:12:36,082
Oh, God,
I want to go home.

518
01:12:37,459 --> 01:12:39,859
Ow!

519
01:12:39,928 --> 01:12:43,227
<i>Ow! Ow!</i>

520
01:12:46,334 --> 01:12:48,359
<i>Take him away!</i>

521
01:13:03,118 --> 01:13:05,211
Tomorrow, I'll hunt again.

522
01:13:06,588 --> 01:13:09,318
Then we'll leave another head
for the beast.

523
01:13:17,265 --> 01:13:20,598
Some of you will stay
and defend the gate.

524
01:13:21,803 --> 01:13:24,670
The beast may try
and come in.

525
01:13:30,645 --> 01:13:32,738
Remember how he crawled ?

526
01:13:32,814 --> 01:13:35,908
<i>He came disguised.</i>

527
01:13:35,984 --> 01:13:38,919
<i>The beast may try and come,</i>

528
01:13:38,987 --> 01:13:42,081
<i>even though we gave him
the head of our kill to eat.</i>

529
01:13:42,157 --> 01:13:44,387
<i>So watch and be careful.</i>

530
01:13:47,929 --> 01:13:50,523
But didn't we--
Didn't we--

531
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,426
<i>No. How could we kill it ?</i>

532
01:14:00,442 --> 01:14:04,378
He told us.
The beast was disguised.

533
01:14:06,248 --> 01:14:10,344
Tomorrow, when we get meat,
we'll have a feast.

534
01:14:12,621 --> 01:14:14,816
- Chief?
- Yes, Bill ?

535
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:17,825
<i>What'll we use
to light the fire ?</i>

536
01:14:17,893 --> 01:14:21,351
We'll get fire
from the others.

537
01:14:23,331 --> 01:14:25,322
We've got to get
out of this.

538
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,334
What do you mean ?

539
01:14:27,402 --> 01:14:30,132
Get rescued.

540
01:14:30,205 --> 01:14:32,639
I mean it.

541
01:14:32,707 --> 01:14:36,507
If we don't get out of here soon,
we'll be barmy.

542
01:14:36,578 --> 01:14:39,479
- Around the bend.
- Crackers.

543
01:14:47,989 --> 01:14:50,981
Have you written a letter
to your auntie lately ?

544
01:14:51,059 --> 01:14:53,289
I don't know
where she is now,

545
01:14:53,361 --> 01:14:57,263
and I haven't got
an envelope or a stamp,

546
01:14:57,332 --> 01:15:00,699
and there isn't
a pillar box or a postman.

547
01:15:02,837 --> 01:15:05,601
I haven't said
anything very funny.

548
01:15:09,844 --> 01:15:15,680
<i>Piggy-y-y-y!</i>

549
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:17,843
<i>Piggy!</i>

550
01:15:19,821 --> 01:15:22,119
Don't make a sound.

551
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:24,681
<i>We're going
to get you, Piggy.</i>

552
01:15:26,761 --> 01:15:28,991
<i>Piggy ?</i>

553
01:15:29,064 --> 01:15:32,033
<i>Where are you, Piggy ?</i>

554
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,331
<i>- We've come to get you.</i>

555
01:15:45,714 --> 01:15:49,115
Ow! Ow! Ow!

556
01:16:03,598 --> 01:16:06,192
<i>Piggy, you've changed!</i>

557
01:16:06,267 --> 01:16:08,758
Piggy!

558
01:17:20,008 --> 01:17:23,375
I just take the conch
to say this.

559
01:17:23,445 --> 01:17:26,972
I can't see
without my glasses,

560
01:17:27,048 --> 01:17:29,949
<i>and I got to get them back.</i>

561
01:17:30,018 --> 01:17:32,885
<i>What are we going to do ?</i>

562
01:17:54,609 --> 01:17:56,702
Hey! Who goes there ?

563
01:17:56,778 --> 01:18:00,612
Stop being silly!
You can see who I am!

564
01:18:16,264 --> 01:18:18,698
I'm calling an assembly!

565
01:18:18,766 --> 01:18:21,098
<i>Boo! Boo!</i>

566
01:18:29,544 --> 01:18:32,206
Don't leave me, Ralph!

567
01:18:35,016 --> 01:18:38,076
You sit down
and wait for me. Here.

568
01:18:44,592 --> 01:18:47,026
What do you want ?

569
01:18:47,095 --> 01:18:51,498
<i>Go away, Ralph!
You keep to your end.</i>

570
01:18:51,566 --> 01:18:56,196
This is my end and my tribe.
You have to leave me alone.

571
01:18:56,271 --> 01:19:00,230
<i>You took Piggy's specs.
You've got to give them back.</i>

572
01:19:00,308 --> 01:19:03,243
Got to ? Who says ?

573
01:19:03,311 --> 01:19:06,371
I say!
That was a dirty trick.

574
01:19:06,447 --> 01:19:09,382
We would have given you fire
if you asked for it.

575
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:12,351
But you didn't.
You came sneaking up like a thief.

576
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:15,355
- Say that again!
- Thief! Thief!

577
01:19:15,423 --> 01:19:17,550
Who's a thief?

578
01:19:17,625 --> 01:19:19,559
You are!

579
01:19:20,795 --> 01:19:24,993
Ralph!
Remember what we came for.

580
01:19:25,066 --> 01:19:27,830
The fire. My specs.

581
01:19:27,902 --> 01:19:30,996
Don't you see ? There may be
a ship out there or a plane!

582
01:19:38,813 --> 01:19:41,407
- Grab 'em!
-Jack!

583
01:19:41,482 --> 01:19:43,814
<i>Tie 'em up!</i>

584
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:49,089
See ?
They do what I want.

585
01:19:49,157 --> 01:19:52,718
You're a beast and a swine
and a bloody, bloody thief!

586
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:58,364
<i>Boo! Boo!</i>

587
01:19:58,433 --> 01:20:01,129
<i>Go, Jack! Go!</i>

588
01:20:21,789 --> 01:20:24,280
<i>Let me speak!</i>

589
01:20:24,359 --> 01:20:26,793
I've got the conch!

590
01:20:42,644 --> 01:20:45,135
Which is it better to be ?

591
01:20:45,213 --> 01:20:49,513
A pack of panting savages
like you are...

592
01:20:50,718 --> 01:20:52,982
or sensible like Ralph is ?

593
01:20:53,054 --> 01:20:56,285
- Which is better?

594
01:20:56,357 --> 01:21:00,623
<i>To have rules and agree,
or to hunt and kill?</i>

595
01:21:11,973 --> 01:21:15,500
- Piggy!

596
01:22:33,321 --> 01:22:36,256
<i>Sam and Eric!
Hey, Sam and Eric.</i>

597
01:22:36,324 --> 01:22:38,849
<i>It's me, Ralph.</i>

598
01:22:42,830 --> 01:22:45,230
When they find me,
what are they going to do ?

599
01:22:46,868 --> 01:22:49,837
Roger sharpened a stick
at both ends.

600
01:22:49,904 --> 01:22:53,169
<i>They're going to hurt you tomorrow.</i>

601
01:22:54,909 --> 01:22:58,037
We've got to give signals
like this: woo-woo-woo!

602
01:22:58,112 --> 01:23:00,307
Only louder, of course.

603
01:23:00,381 --> 01:23:03,009
<i>You've got to go now, Ralph.</i>

604
01:23:07,088 --> 01:23:09,579
Won't you come with me ?

605
01:23:09,657 --> 01:23:13,354
Three of us would have
a better chance.

606
01:23:13,428 --> 01:23:15,362
Woo-woo-woo-woo!

607
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:16,863
Quick, Ralph!

608
01:23:16,931 --> 01:23:19,866
I'll be that thicket.
They won't think to look so close.

609
01:23:19,934 --> 01:23:22,334
<i>- Who's there ?
Attention!</i>

610
01:23:22,403 --> 01:23:25,133
Eric, it's Roger.

611
01:23:25,206 --> 01:23:28,107
Here. Take this.

612
01:23:30,044 --> 01:23:32,444
<i>Attention!</i>

613
01:23:33,614 --> 01:23:36,048
<i>Scouts'report.</i>

614
01:23:36,117 --> 01:23:39,052
<i>Woo-woo-woo-woo!</i>

615
01:23:53,701 --> 01:23:56,226
<i>Come here!</i>

616
01:23:56,304 --> 01:23:59,432
<i>Got Piggy's specs ?
I'll start a fire.</i>

617
01:24:02,376 --> 01:24:04,901
<i>He must be in here somewhere.</i>

618
01:24:04,979 --> 01:24:09,006
<i>You go around that way.
We'll smoke him out.</i>

619
01:24:13,654 --> 01:24:16,589
<i>Shhh. Something's moved.</i>

620
01:24:16,657 --> 01:24:19,490
<i>Roger, come help.</i>

621
01:24:22,263 --> 01:24:24,197
<i>Got the stick ?</i>

622
01:24:34,842 --> 01:24:37,072
<i>I told you.
He's dangerous.</i>

623
01:24:41,415 --> 01:24:44,714
<i>Woo-woo-woo-woo!

<i>Hi! Ouch!</i>

5
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:43,295
你好,等一下我.

6
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:46,992
我几乎不能移动这些爬行动物.

7
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:51,962
其他的小孩一定已经在黑暗中被冲散了.

8
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:55,371
我必须去找到他们.

9
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:19,961
我婶婶嘱咐我不能跑on account 因为我的哮喘.

10
00:05:20,032 --> 00:05:22,227
<i>- 哮喘 ?
- 那好吧.</i>

11
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,828
我是学校里唯一患有哮喘的男生.

12
00:05:29,742 --> 00:05:32,939
还有,我三岁就带上眼睛了.

13
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,805
<i>- 飞机在哪里 ?
- 一定被风暴刮走了.</i>

14
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:42,171
<i>一定还有一些孩子留在这里了.</i>

15
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:46,183
<i>有没有大人 ?</i>

16
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:49,119
- 我不这么想.
- 你叫什么名字 ?

17
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:51,122
拉尔夫.

18
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,124
我不在乎他们怎么称呼我,

19
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:56,355
只要不想他们在学校里那样称呼我就可以了.

20
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:58,363
他们怎么称呼你 ?

21
00:06:59,732 --> 00:07:03,327
- 他们一直称呼我是''猪仔.''
- 猪仔!

22
00:07:03,402 --> 00:07:06,200
只要你不告诉别人.

23
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:11,777
爸爸的一个海军司令.

24
00:07:14,213 --> 00:07:17,148
等当他得到许可,他就会来拯救我们.

25
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:48,372
<i>- 你不进来?-啊,它真热.</i>

26
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:50,472
不,我婶婶不让我这么干,因为我的哮喘.

27
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,983
<i>停止你的哮喘吧.</i>

28
00:07:54,186 --> 00:07:57,121
<i>你连一半的距离都游不好.</i>

29
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:20,411
<i>- 嗨,看,一个海螺.</i>

30
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,176
<i>我见过一个很像它的那个人有个在院墙上.</i>

31
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:29,517
<i>一个海螺,他喊道.他敲击它,他妈妈就过来了.</i>

32
00:08:34,694 --> 00:08:37,322
- 把它轰下来.

33
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:39,990
- 我来弄!

34
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:51,776
嗨,那是什么 ?

35
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:06,157
嗨! 嗨!

36
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:14,126
- 我想我们该开个会.

37
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,033
- 你叫什么名字 ?
- 威廉斯麦迪逊珀西瓦尔...

38
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:22,769
牧师,圣安东尼,电话:241哈科特 .

39
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,610
<i>- 你的名字呢 ?
- 乔治.</i>

40
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:31,412
- 你的名字?
- 萨姆和埃里克(他们是两兄弟).

41
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:33,418
萨姆和埃里克.

42
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:36,080
萨姆和埃里克.

43
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:40,877
Choir, halt!

44
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:44,656
有大人吗?
有小号(乐器)吗 ?

45
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:47,022
这里没有大人
没有小号,只有我们.

46
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:49,493
- 这里没有大人吗 ?
- 没有.

47
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:52,224
那么我们就要照顾自己.

48
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:56,792
我们在开会.过来参加吧.

49
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:59,360
- 他还行吗 ?

50
00:10:59,438 --> 00:11:01,633
把他抬到阴凉的地方,快!

51
00:11:11,283 --> 00:11:15,447
<i>- 让我一个人待着.
- 但是, Merridew.</i>

52
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:19,855
<i>他很快就没事了.
西门总是晕倒.</i>

53
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:22,826
<i>现在让我们决定我们该做点什么.</i>

54
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:27,229
这也就是为什么拉尔夫开会--
为了决定我们该怎么办.

55
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:29,893
我要所有人的名单.

56
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:32,767
那两个,你们两个双胞胎.
Sam 和 Eric.

57
00:11:32,838 --> 00:11:35,272
- 我是 Sam.
- 我是 Eric.

58
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:36,968
我是 拉尔夫.

59
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:41,508
<i>- 还有你 ?
- 道格拉斯.</i>

60
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,640
<i>- 你的 ?
- 查尔斯.</i>

61
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:47,379
那么你们的名字 ?

62
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:49,387
Henry.

63
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:52,557
Maurice.

64
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:56,227
Robert.

65
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:00,698
Wilbur.

66
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:05,703
Harold.

67
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:10,041
Bill.

68
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:14,112
Roger.

69
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,417
<i>- 西门.
- 我是 杰克.</i>

70
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:24,154
- 那边那个孩子. 他--
- 你说的太多了.

71
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:26,851
- 闭嘴, 胖子!
- 他的名字不是 胖子.

72
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:29,360
- 他真正的名字是 猪仔.
- 猪仔!

73
00:12:47,112 --> 00:12:49,546
我们一定要决定怎样获救.

74
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:52,083
我认为我们应该有个头头做决策.

75
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:54,915
<i>- 必须有人负责.
</i>

76
00:12:54,987 --> 00:12:56,921
<i>- 我要当头头.
- 他有海螺!</i>

77
00:12:56,989 --> 00:13:01,085
<i>- 是他把我们集合到这里的.
- 我是男童合唱团的头.</i>

78
00:13:02,194 --> 00:13:03,593
<i>- 让我们进行一次投票.</i>

79
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:07,256
<i>好的. 我们要进行一次.</i>

80
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,962
<i>- 谁希望杰克 当选?</i>

81
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,611
<i>- 谁选我 ?
- 我!</i>

82
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:24,945
- 我!
- 我!

83
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:26,951
<i>我 . 我 .</i>

84
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,264
<i>那么,我是头头.</i>

85
00:13:45,137 --> 00:13:48,629
<i>杰克负责合唱团.
你们希望他们做什么 ?</i>

86
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:51,942
猎人.

87
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:54,479
<i>合唱团,脱下你们的衣服.</i>

88
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:03,444
嗨, 你穿什么?
那些可笑的衣服吗 ?

89
00:14:03,522 --> 00:14:05,786
那是我们的制服.

90
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:17,665
<i>每个人给我听着.
如果这里不是一个岛屿,</i>

91
00:14:17,736 --> 00:14:19,670
也许我们可以立刻得救


92
00:14:19,738 --> 00:14:21,672
所以我们决定看看这里是不是一个岛屿.

93
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,267
<i>我们将挑选3个人去探险.</i>

94
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:29,508
我和杰克去.

95
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:32,311
<i>- 那么--
- 请带上我.</i>

96
00:14:32,384 --> 00:14:34,477
你. 你还好吗 ?

97
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:40,885
- 我会去的.
- 我们不需要你. 3个人足够了.

98
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,326
我一直和他在一起,从他发现海螺开始就在一起.

99
00:14:43,395 --> 00:14:46,660
我一直和他在一起,比任何人都早.

100
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:58,232
- 你不能去.
- 你告诉他们在我说了以后--

101
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,711
在我说了以后我不希望--

102
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,714
你在谈论些什么 ?

103
00:15:03,782 --> 00:15:06,216
在谈论猪仔.

104
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:10,779
我说过我不在乎,只要他们不叫我猪仔.

105
00:15:10,856 --> 00:15:13,586
不要告诉我.

106
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:16,651
然后你来了,然后你就直接说出来了--

107
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:19,220
- 好了 猪仔 比胖子好.

108
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:21,994
而无论如何,对不起,如果你喜欢.

109
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:25,935
回去, 猪仔, 去弄你的名单.
那是你的任务. 再见.

110
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:23,627
<i>嗨, 看!</i>

111
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:31,158
一个, 两个, 三个.

112
00:16:31,236 --> 00:16:32,965
举起来!

113
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,075
举起来!

114
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:04,553
<i>我们面对的是个无人岛.</i>

115
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:08,286
<i>我们要自己照顾自己.</i>

116
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,126
<i>但这是一个很好的岛屿.还有很多水果淡水,</i>

117
00:19:12,197 --> 00:19:15,496
<i>我敢肯定不会有任何危险动物.</i>

118
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:18,468
<i>事情并不那么坏.</i>

119
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:20,471
<i>我们也没有受伤.</i>

120
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,373
<i>并无任何危险,</i>

121
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:27,037
<i>我们可以建很舒适的庇护地.</i>

122
00:19:29,314 --> 00:19:32,442
如果我们明智--
如果我们能合理的做事--

123
00:19:32,517 --> 00:19:35,350
如果我们不迷失自我--
我们会过的很好的.

124
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:40,156
- 不过我们在哪里睡觉 ?
- 我们要建一个庇护地.

125
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:43,194
We can have smashing fun.

126
00:19:43,262 --> 00:19:46,197
还有另外一件事.
我不能让所有人同时说话.

127
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:51,225
我们要举手,
然后我把海螺给他,他才能说话.

128
00:19:51,303 --> 00:19:54,136
<i>[杰克 ]
我同意拉尔夫的.</i>

129
00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:56,140
我们要有我们的规矩并且服从它.

130
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,802
毕竟, 我们不是野蛮人.
我们是英格兰人.

131
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:01,243
<i>-英格兰人做任何事都是最好的.</i>

132
00:20:01,313 --> 00:20:05,716
<i>因此我们将会有更多的规矩,
任何人都不能打破它们--</i>

133
00:20:10,522 --> 00:20:13,013
- 猪仔, 猪仔, 猪仔!
- 安静!

134
00:20:13,091 --> 00:20:17,118
你们不让拉尔夫说最重要的话吗?.

135
00:20:18,196 --> 00:20:21,359
谁知道我们在这里?

136
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:24,732
没有人知道我们在这里.

137
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:28,261
或许他们知道我们将要去哪里,

138
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,604
或许不知道.

139
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:34,669
但是他们不知道我们现在在这里,我们也没有来过这.

140
00:20:34,746 --> 00:20:37,681
<i>我们也许要待在这里直到我们死去.</i>

141
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:04,101
他想知道你打算怎么处理关于蛇的事.

142
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:07,407
告诉我们关于蛇的事.

143
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:13,577
现在他说这只是个小动物而已.

144
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:15,381
小动物?

145
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:22,619
<i>-一个像蛇的东西, 相当大. 他看见那东西了.
- 什么时候 ?</i>

146
00:21:26,198 --> 00:21:31,261
当他躲在黑暗的丛林中时.

147
00:21:31,336 --> 00:21:34,897
<i>他说是在雨停了时,</i>

148
00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:39,171
它变成一个绳子一样的东西,挂在树上...

149
00:21:39,244 --> 00:21:41,576
就挂在树枝上.

150
00:21:41,646 --> 00:21:44,843
他说,
''夜里它回来了怎么办啊 ?''

151
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:53,456
<i>但是那不是一个什么小动物.</i>

152
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:56,016
我告诉你,
那不是一个野兽.

153
00:21:57,262 --> 00:21:59,321
拉尔夫是对的, 确实.

154
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:03,095
那不是一个类似蛇的东西, 不过如果是, 我们就应该猎杀它.

155
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,563
<i>还有另外一件事.
如果附近出现船,</i>

156
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:09,573
他们无法注意到我们.

157
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:12,974
所以我们必须在高地弄出烟来
在山上. 我们需要篝火.

158
00:22:13,044 --> 00:22:14,671
过来. 跟着我.

159
00:22:14,746 --> 00:22:18,409
- 好!
- 现在就走!

160
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:25,613
真像一群孩子--
像一群孩子

161
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:33,496
我敢说只要喝杯茶的时间.

162
00:22:46,445 --> 00:22:48,379
<i>所有人就都去游戏了 ?</i>

163
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,286
My, what a big heap一大堆
you've made你弄的!

164
00:22:57,355 --> 00:22:59,516
猪仔的眼镜!
过来!

165
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:11,660
<i>对准光线!</i>

166
00:23:11,736 --> 00:23:14,432
<i>Roger,嗨, Roger.
到这里来.</i>

167
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:32,890
我的眼镜!

168
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:41,456
拉尔夫, 我要分裂我的合唱团--
我的猎人们, 现在.

169
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:43,694
我们就要负责保持持续篝火.

170
00:23:46,938 --> 00:23:50,738
我们会弄出火灾的.
它会持续整个夜晚的.

171
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,943
<i>来给我一些人手.</i>

172
00:24:51,202 --> 00:24:53,136
注意!

173
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:09,953
现在过来一个.

174
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:14,250
这个一个好样的.

175
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,971
就一分钟.
小心.

176
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:34,401
走!

177
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,072
不!

178
00:25:37,148 --> 00:25:39,082
它不会伤害你!

179
00:25:40,051 --> 00:25:41,382
哦!

180
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:44,320
过来, 过来!

181
00:27:32,931 --> 00:27:35,297
杀! 杀!

182
00:27:38,937 --> 00:27:41,132
<i>不要扔沙子!</i>

183
00:27:50,348 --> 00:27:53,215
<i>拉尔夫, 到这里来! 一架飞机!</i>

184
00:27:53,284 --> 00:27:54,842
一架飞机! 一架飞机!

185
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:59,219
<i>你没听见吗 ? 拉尔夫, 它走了!
赶紧! 拉尔夫!</i>

186
00:28:01,192 --> 00:28:05,458
我看不见烟了.
烟在哪里 ?

187
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:10,163
烟.

188
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:13,398
猪仔的眼镜!
如果我们的篝火还在, 我们要克服他们!

189
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:37,584
停下! 回来!
回来!

190
00:28:37,662 --> 00:28:41,758
回来! 回来!

191
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,283
他们让这该死的篝火灭了!

192
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:13,492
<i>Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!(杀野猪,割喉咙,打倒它)</i>

193
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:15,499
<i>嗨, 拉尔夫!</i>

194
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:20,297

杀野猪,割喉咙!

195
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:22,635
打倒它!
杀野猪!割喉咙!

196
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:25,870
<i>打倒它!
杀野猪!割喉咙!</i>

197
00:29:25,944 --> 00:29:29,277
<i>打倒它! 杀野猪!
割喉咙! 打倒它!</i>

198
00:29:29,347 --> 00:29:31,941
杀野猪!
割喉咙! 打倒它!

199
00:29:32,016 --> 00:29:35,782
杀野猪! 割喉咙!
打倒它! 杀野猪!

200
00:29:35,854 --> 00:29:38,288
割喉咙!
打倒它! 杀野猪!

201
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:42,349
割喉咙! 打倒它!
杀野猪! 割喉咙!

202
00:29:42,427 --> 00:29:44,361
<i>打倒它!
杀野猪!</i>

203
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:46,920
<i>看. 我们猎杀了一头野猪!
我们偷偷包围了它!</i>

204
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:48,932
你让火灭了.

205
00:29:50,768 --> 00:29:53,293
我们无法再次点燃篝火.

206
00:30:00,912 --> 00:30:02,846
你应该和我们在一起, 拉尔夫.

207
00:30:02,914 --> 00:30:05,144
这里流着血!
你应该看看我们的野猪.

208
00:30:05,216 --> 00:30:09,243
那是一架飞机.
那是一架飞机!

209
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:14,384
他们本来可以看见我们.
他们会带我们回家!

210
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:28,868
<i>你和你的血, 杰克 Merridew!</i>

211
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,899
你和你的打猎!
我们本来已经回家了!

212
00:30:32,977 --> 00:30:34,911
我们想吃肉啊.

213
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:41,049
<i>你怎么能让看守篝火的也去打猎!</i>

214
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,088
<i>- 我的眼镜!</i>

215
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,220
这里.在这里.

216
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,684
你等一等!

217
00:31:14,752 --> 00:31:18,051
这是一个肮脏的把戏.

218
00:31:18,122 --> 00:31:21,091
好的, 好的.
对不起!

219
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:23,855
我的意思是篝火.

220
00:31:23,928 --> 00:31:28,228
现在,我正式道歉.

221
00:31:30,568 --> 00:31:32,502
点火,现在.

222
00:31:33,037 --> 00:31:35,505
合唱团!

223
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:42,811
猪仔.

224
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,643
不, 拉尔夫, 请不要这样!

225
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:46,650
我会还给你的.

226
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,733
<i>将它膨胀起来双腿 ?</i>

227
00:32:03,801 --> 00:32:05,735
<i>- 给我一个腿.</i>

228
00:32:06,971 --> 00:32:09,872
<i>- 把它给我.
- 请给我一片.</i>

229
00:32:58,289 --> 00:33:00,621
你不是不要吗 ?

230
00:33:00,691 --> 00:33:02,784
你没有去打猎.

231
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,819
没有拉尔夫的那份.
没有西门的那份.

232
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,070
吃吧,你们这些该死的!

233
00:33:29,353 --> 00:33:33,517
- 杀野猪!
- (猪)发呼噜声.

234
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:36,958
杀野猪! 割喉咙!
打倒它!

235
00:33:37,028 --> 00:33:39,758
杀野猪!
割喉咙!打倒它!

236
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:42,664
杀野猪! 割喉咙!
打倒它!

237
00:33:42,733 --> 00:33:45,531
杀野猪!
割喉咙!打倒它!


238
00:33:45,603 --> 00:33:48,163
杀野猪! 割喉咙!
打倒它!

239
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:50,173
<i>杀野猪!
割喉咙!</i>

240
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:52,175
安静!

241
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:56,111
在沙滩上坐下.
我们需要开会.

242
00:34:07,992 --> 00:34:11,291
<i>事情变糟了.</i>

243
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:15,561
<i>我不知道为什么.</i>

244
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:17,794
<i>开始时一切还好.</i>

245
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:21,430
<i>不过现在人们开始遗忘了.</i>

246
00:34:24,742 --> 00:34:29,179
最重要的事情是我们需要获救.

247
00:34:32,116 --> 00:34:35,574
<i>所以再来谈谁做什么,以及何时我们决定,</i>

248
00:34:38,122 --> 00:34:40,989
我们可以重新开始...

249
00:34:41,058 --> 00:34:44,050
需要小心的事,比如篝火.

250
00:34:45,229 --> 00:34:48,665
<i>好了, 让篝火走吧.</i>

251
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:51,065
<i>但是我们饿啊.
我们需要肉.</i>

252
00:34:51,135 --> 00:34:53,365
<i>如果是野兽,</i>

253
00:34:53,437 --> 00:34:56,270
这是我的猎人
愿它保护你.

254
00:35:09,887 --> 00:35:11,855
<i>你叫什么名字?</i>

255
00:35:11,923 --> 00:35:15,950
<i>你叫什么名字? 你叫什么名字?</i>

256
00:35:16,027 --> 00:35:18,018
你叫什么名字 ?

257
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:23,099
安静! 安静!

258
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:28,271
你叫什么名字 ?

259
00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:32,070
威廉斯麦迪逊珀西瓦尔,
牧师,

260
00:35:32,143 --> 00:35:34,873
Hartcourt, St. Anthony大街.

261
00:35:34,946 --> 00:35:38,609
电话--

262
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:42,084
电话--

263
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:45,088
<i>- 电话--</i>

264
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:32,835
<i>他在说什么 ?</i>

265
00:36:32,903 --> 00:36:36,066
<i>他说起过野兽的事.</i>

266
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,870
<i>它从海里来.</i>

267
00:36:59,897 --> 00:37:05,062
我爸爸说海洋动物还没有被全部发现.

268
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:07,934
我爸爸说那些动物--

269
00:37:08,005 --> 00:37:09,996
你称它为 ?

270
00:37:10,074 --> 00:37:13,373
他们制造墨水
有上百英尺长...

271
00:37:13,444 --> 00:37:15,412
可是吃掉整条鲸.

272
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:18,812
<i>章无法离开水.</i>

273
00:37:34,398 --> 00:37:37,026
也许这只是他在做白日梦.

274
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:40,537
<i>可能这就是怪兽,妖怪.</i>

275
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:51,407
我从来就不相信有妖怪.

276
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:54,918
<i>- 谁会在乎你是否相信, 胖子 ?</i>

277
00:37:57,688 --> 00:38:01,954
也许是怪兽.

278
00:38:02,026 --> 00:38:04,824
<i>听他说. 他有海螺.</i>

279
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:11,657
我的意思是,

280
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:14,899
也许那只是我们自己.

281
00:38:14,972 --> 00:38:16,906
<i>疯子!</i>

282
00:38:23,647 --> 00:38:27,413
我们必须离开这一切直到天亮.

283
00:38:27,485 --> 00:38:29,419
我们累了.

284
00:38:31,355 --> 00:38:36,088
我们要投票--
我的意思是关于妖怪--

285
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,720
投票后回庇护所.

286
00:38:40,698 --> 00:38:43,132
谁认为那是妖怪?

287
00:39:03,053 --> 00:39:06,750
<i>- 我看见了.
- 我不会给没有妖怪投票的.</i>

288
00:39:06,824 --> 00:39:08,883
<i>忘记它吧, 你们所有人.</i>

289
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:10,927
<i>你闭嘴, 你这个胖子!</i>

290
00:39:10,995 --> 00:39:12,963
我有海螺!

291
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,157
<i>哦, 杰克, 让他说.
他拿着海螺.</i>

292
00:39:15,232 --> 00:39:17,996
还是,该闭嘴的是你. 你是谁,
告诉人们该干什么的家伙吗 ?

293
00:39:18,068 --> 00:39:21,435
 你不会打猎. 不会唱歌.
 我才是头头. 我是合唱团的领唱.

294
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:24,269
为什么要选择什么差别,
告诉人们该干什么 ?

295
00:39:24,341 --> 00:39:28,038
- 猪仔拿着海螺.
- 你永远站在猪仔那一边.

296
00:39:28,112 --> 00:39:30,205
-杰克!
-杰克! 杰克!

297
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:33,045
- 你在打破规矩!
- 谁在乎 ?

298
00:39:33,117 --> 00:39:35,449
可是规则是我们唯一拥有的东西.

299
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:37,783
Bullocks to the rules!
我们是强大的,我们是猎人.

300
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:40,050
如果有野兽,
我们就杀了它!

301
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:53,163
大人会怎么说 ? 看看'em!

302
00:39:54,638 --> 00:39:59,337
我感觉我应该放弃头头的位子了.

303
00:40:00,744 --> 00:40:05,147
你不能这样, 拉尔夫. 现在不行.

304
00:40:05,216 --> 00:40:09,380
吹海螺.
你还拿着海螺呢.

305
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:12,354
让他们照你说的去做.

306
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:18,261
如果是我吹海螺,

307
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:20,820
他们不会回来,

308
00:40:20,898 --> 00:40:23,025
then we've had it.

309
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,081
你相信妖怪吗, 猪仔 ?
或者怪兽 ?

310
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,516
当然不相信了.

311
00:40:42,586 --> 00:40:46,044
 为什么不 ?
 因为这些事情没有发生.

312
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:53,493
房子和街道...
还有电视.

313
00:40:53,564 --> 00:40:55,498
他们不想工作.

314
00:40:57,268 --> 00:41:02,467
我猜想他们不会感觉到,这个岛上什么也没有.

315
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:07,534
我感觉有什么东西正在看着我们...

316
00:41:07,611 --> 00:41:09,545
在等着我们.

317
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:13,149
<i>继续当头头, 拉尔夫.</i>

318
00:41:13,217 --> 00:41:15,208
<i>谁在那里 ?</i>

319
00:41:15,286 --> 00:41:17,220
我, 西门.

320
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:23,453
<i>我希望我婶婶在这里.</i>

321
00:41:23,527 --> 00:41:26,121
哦,那有什么用 ?

322
00:41:27,364 --> 00:41:29,559
<i>大人知道的东西.</i>

323
00:41:29,633 --> 00:41:32,602
<i>他们并不害怕黑暗.</i>

324
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,730
他们需要肉和茶还有谈论.

325
00:41:35,806 --> 00:41:38,775
事情就解决了.

326
00:42:43,934 --> 00:42:44,866
<i>Sam.</i>

327
00:42:44,935 --> 00:42:46,869
<i>怎么了?</i>

328
00:42:46,937 --> 00:42:48,871
Shh.

329
00:43:13,096 --> 00:43:16,793
<i>它变模糊了.
 有什么东西在移动...</i>

330
00:43:16,867 --> 00:43:19,893
<i>在它的头后面有翅膀.</i>

331
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,461
<i>这样座了起来.</i>

332
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:27,067
<i>有眼睛牙齿爪子.</i>

333
00:43:27,144 --> 00:43:31,945
<i>我们要尽量跑,用石头砸.</i>

334
00:43:32,015 --> 00:43:34,074
<i>那个怪兽跟着我们.</i>

335
00:43:34,151 --> 00:43:36,381
<i>它会抓住我的.</i>

336
00:43:37,287 --> 00:43:40,484
你没有拉着我们的腿,不是吗 ?

337
00:43:42,492 --> 00:43:45,723
- 我们会捕获它的. 谁过来 ?
- 我! 我!

338
00:43:45,796 --> 00:43:49,630
但是那些木棒,用木头做的.
别那么 silly.

339
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:50,631
害怕了 ?


340
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,634
确实,我是.
谁不害怕 ?

341
00:43:52,702 --> 00:43:53,828
过来 走吧.

342
00:43:53,904 --> 00:43:56,065
谁来那些小孩子登名单 ?

343
00:43:56,139 --> 00:43:59,631
 猪仔会做的.
 好了. 别让猪仔冒险了.

344
00:43:59,709 --> 00:44:01,643
你没有任何意义 ?

345
00:44:01,711 --> 00:44:04,646
如何帮助只有一只眼的猪仔 ?

346
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:11,009
杰克, 这个岛上是不是还有我们没有到过的地方?

347
00:44:11,088 --> 00:44:13,022
那里是唯一没有去过的地方了--
确实!

348
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:15,650
尾端部份,
有石头摞在那里.

349
00:45:04,074 --> 00:45:06,668
我是头头.
我要一个人去.

350
00:45:06,743 --> 00:45:09,678
其余的藏在这里等你.

351
00:45:15,218 --> 00:45:17,379
你是不是认为--

352
00:45:17,454 --> 00:45:20,582
我一直都.
必须在这里.

353
00:45:27,564 --> 00:45:31,557
我不相信怪兽.

354
00:45:33,336 --> 00:45:35,270
我也不这么想.

355
00:46:44,274 --> 00:46:46,242
它不能让你自己.

356
00:47:11,668 --> 00:47:13,602
在任何地方都有要塞!

357
00:47:22,479 --> 00:47:24,413
怪兽不在这里.

358
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:28,474
-那就让其他人去山顶.
-孩子们!

359
00:47:35,825 --> 00:47:40,455
现在这个问题是有关我居住的地方,

360
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,998
叫Camberley来.

361
00:47:43,066 --> 00:47:46,433
现在, Camberley是很老的地方,

362
00:47:46,503 --> 00:47:50,166
不过他不是一直被称为Camberley的.

363
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,267
他只是过去被称为
Cambridgetown.

364
00:47:54,344 --> 00:47:58,041
他们用来混淆的字母...

365
00:47:58,114 --> 00:48:02,414
在Cambridge和Cambridgetown之间.

366
00:48:02,485 --> 00:48:06,581
So letters that were to a person
in Cambridgetown...

367
00:48:06,656 --> 00:48:10,649
used to go to a person
in Cambridge.

368
00:48:10,727 --> 00:48:14,686
故得有点混为一谈.所以他们自认变化...

369
00:48:14,764 --> 00:48:17,494
在邮局名称,因为它是邮政局...

370
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:21,401
所有的麻烦已经字母排序.

371
00:48:21,471 --> 00:48:26,374
我认为他们从Cambridgetown离开"cam",

372
00:48:26,443 --> 00:48:27,535
和他们--

373
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,100
''ber'' 是条河,

374
00:48:29,179 --> 00:48:31,909
而周围有许多河流上.

375
00:48:31,981 --> 00:48:39,513
''(道路等中央部分的)拱势.'' 以及 ''草地,'' 因为附近的城镇靠近"草地"的结束

376
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:41,750
他们的名字以''ley.''为结尾

377
00:48:41,825 --> 00:48:45,488
所以被称为
Cam-ber-ley. Camberley.

378
00:48:45,562 --> 00:48:47,689
这就是关于 Camberley的真相.

379
00:48:59,743 --> 00:49:01,768
我不认为我们应该与小朋友离开猪仔.

380
00:49:01,845 --> 00:49:03,335
没关系.

381
00:49:03,413 --> 00:49:07,349
我们不能让猪仔出任何事,不是吗?

382
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:12,821
我觉得应该有人回去告诉他们,我们不会回来直到天黑.

383
00:49:14,224 --> 00:49:16,658
我去.我不介意.

384
00:49:16,726 --> 00:49:18,717
诚实.

385
00:49:45,822 --> 00:49:48,723
我们应该去沙滩.

386
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:50,726
明天我们可以去山顶.

387
00:49:50,794 --> 00:49:53,092
如果你害怕,当然.

388
00:49:53,163 --> 00:49:55,495
好吧,那么.我们现在去?

389
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,065
你看 ?

390
00:49:59,135 --> 00:50:01,933
现在我爬上山去寻找野兽.

391
00:50:02,005 --> 00:50:04,405
- 过来?
- 我不介意.

392
00:50:04,474 --> 00:50:06,533
如果你不介意, 当然.

393
00:50:06,609 --> 00:50:07,940
没关系!

394
00:50:11,047 --> 00:50:13,914
我认为这里只有我们两个人在走.

395
00:50:13,983 --> 00:50:18,477
如果我们遇到另一边的什么东西,两个人是不够的.

396
00:50:24,093 --> 00:50:27,153
好的.
一个人过来, Roger.

397
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,674
如果你不想继续
我就自己去.

398
00:50:46,749 --> 00:50:50,241
那么,继续吧.
我们在这里等.

399
00:51:00,497 --> 00:51:02,431
闭嘴.

400
00:51:09,873 --> 00:51:12,137
我看见山顶有东西.

401
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:15,666
那里太吵了.
例如...

402
00:51:40,336 --> 00:51:43,271
<i>贴近地面.</i>

403
00:51:49,879 --> 00:51:53,042
<i>那边, 被石头挡住了.</i>

404
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:30,016
首先, 你知道现在我们看见了怪兽.

405
00:52:31,521 --> 00:52:34,957
<i>我们爬过去了.
我们在怪兽几英尺以外.</i>

406
00:52:35,024 --> 00:52:37,390
怪兽坐了起来,看了看我们.

407
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:41,897
我不认为我们能打败它.老实说,你知道.

408
00:52:41,965 --> 00:52:45,901
我们谈谈.我们不能去攻击老虎什么的.

409
00:52:45,969 --> 00:52:49,735
我们藏起来了,连杰克也藏起来了.

410
00:52:49,806 --> 00:52:52,900
- 我们的猎人怎么样了 ?
- 男孩们还手持着棍子呢 ?

411
00:52:52,976 --> 00:52:54,705
好了,那么.

412
00:52:56,679 --> 00:53:00,240
他不是一个猎人.
他从来没有为我们弄到肉.

413
00:53:00,316 --> 00:53:04,082
他只是给了我们一些其他的,
期待人们遵守什么.

414
00:53:04,153 --> 00:53:06,951
<i>他就像猪仔.
他说的话也和猪仔的差不多.</i>

415
00:53:07,023 --> 00:53:08,991
<i>他不是一个称职的头头.
他是个懦夫.</i>

416
00:53:09,058 --> 00:53:12,027
在山顶, 当Roger和我在爬山时,
他站在那里.

417
00:53:12,095 --> 00:53:14,290
- 我也去了.
- 后来.

418
00:53:14,364 --> 00:53:17,765
我也去了, 然后我离开了.
你也是这样.

419
00:53:17,834 --> 00:53:20,268
然后骂我是懦夫.
这一切的鬼话.

420
00:53:20,336 --> 00:53:22,566
- 这一切的鬼话.鬼话
- 好了.

421
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:25,574
我不属于拉尔夫的地盘.

422
00:53:25,642 --> 00:53:29,942
我要去唱歌,吃肉,打猎痛痛快快的玩.

423
00:53:30,013 --> 00:53:32,948
还有谁要走?.

424
00:53:34,984 --> 00:53:36,918
杰克!

425
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:10,609
<i>我只能说,我们没有一个坚定的人.</i>

426
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:13,417
<i>我认为现在我们要下决心.</i>

427
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:15,889
<i>我们可以没有杰克 Merridew也能活下去.</i>

428
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:19,121
<i>这个岛上除了他以外.</i>

429
00:54:19,195 --> 00:54:21,720
<i>但是现在我们真的变成了一个怪兽--</i>

430
00:54:21,798 --> 00:54:24,494
<i>虽然我很难相信--</i>

431
00:54:24,567 --> 00:54:27,730
<i>我们需要贴近宣言.</i>

432
00:54:30,473 --> 00:54:33,340
我讲话, 拉尔夫.

433
00:54:33,409 --> 00:54:34,671
什么 ?

434
00:54:34,744 --> 00:54:37,304
我们不需要在山顶上生火,

435
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:40,577
不过在山脚生火有什么不可以 ?

436
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:45,587
这是个好主意.这里我们可以把它与庇护所放在一起.

437
00:54:45,655 --> 00:54:48,988
我想我们应该爬上山.

438
00:54:49,058 --> 00:54:51,993
<i>那有什么用 ?</i>

439
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,666
还有其他的什么要做的 ?

440
00:55:55,825 --> 00:56:00,262
并提出了一些干叶子.让他们干.

441
00:56:02,732 --> 00:56:05,895
<i>如果是潮湿的,就不会烧好.</i>

442
00:56:39,235 --> 00:56:41,169
过来.

443
00:57:23,246 --> 00:57:25,180
过来.

444
00:57:52,842 --> 00:57:54,776
现在!

445
00:58:41,457 --> 00:58:43,687
抬起屁股.

446
00:59:01,577 --> 00:59:04,512
<i>磨尖棍子两端.</i>

447
00:59:31,707 --> 00:59:34,403
<i>这是个怪兽.</i>

448
00:59:34,477 --> 00:59:36,707
<i>它的礼物.</i>

449
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:48,657
他们看不见吗 ?
他们不明白吗 ?

450
00:59:50,893 --> 00:59:54,556
如果我们不保持篝火冒烟,
我们就会死.

451
00:59:58,034 --> 01:00:00,662
有什么问题 猪仔 ?

452
01:00:02,204 --> 01:00:05,367
为什么他们喜欢的东西总出错 ?

453
01:00:07,109 --> 01:00:09,339
我不知道, 拉尔夫.

454
01:02:02,158 --> 01:02:05,093
好像我们需要些雨水,是吗?.

455
01:02:05,161 --> 01:02:07,686
篝火怎么样了 ?

456
01:02:22,244 --> 01:02:24,610
<i>嗨,回来!</i>

457
01:02:27,516 --> 01:02:29,643
我们因你无法回家--

458
01:02:52,808 --> 01:02:54,742
<i>Wee-wah-wo-wee.</i>

459
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:58,746
<i>Wee-wah-wo-wee.
Wee-wah-wo-wee.</i>

460
01:03:49,498 --> 01:03:52,797
给'em一些吃的.

461
01:04:00,175 --> 01:04:02,507
<i>香蕉!</i>

462
01:04:05,914 --> 01:04:07,905
<i>Wee-wah-woo-wo!</i>

463
01:04:07,983 --> 01:04:11,248
<i>Wee-wah-woo-wo!
Wee-wah-woo-wo!</i>

464
01:04:17,526 --> 01:04:19,994
谁来加入我的部落 ?

465
01:04:24,099 --> 01:04:26,761
杰克. 我要加入你的部落,杰克.

466
01:04:30,773 --> 01:04:33,606
- 谁来加入我的部落 ?
- 我去.

467
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:39,638
我给你们吃的, 我的猎人保护你们不被怪兽袭击.

468
01:04:41,717 --> 01:04:44,948
- 谁来加入我的部落 ?
- 我加入,杰克.

469
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:49,548
我是头头. 谁负责篝火 ?
我拿着海螺!

470
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:53,061
你没有拿着海螺.
你把它放在后面.

471
01:04:54,663 --> 01:04:56,597
看 ? Clever.

472
01:04:58,667 --> 01:05:00,965
总之,海螺在这里不算数.

473
01:05:01,036 --> 01:05:04,130
海螺在这个岛的任何地方都算数.

474
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:08,669
<i>谁要加入我的部落 ?</i>

475
01:05:08,744 --> 01:05:11,008
- 我, 我!
- 我加入!

476
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,640
- 让我们加入杰克的部落!
- 万岁!

477
01:05:16,118 --> 01:05:18,643
Come away.
都去部落了.

478
01:07:05,761 --> 01:07:07,922
杀怪兽!

479
01:07:07,996 --> 01:07:10,897
<i>杀怪兽!
杀野猪!</i>

480
01:07:10,966 --> 01:07:14,561
割喉咙! 打倒它!

481
01:07:14,636 --> 01:07:17,662
杀怪兽!
割喉咙! 打倒它!

482
01:07:17,739 --> 01:07:20,936
杀野猪! 割喉咙! 
打倒它!

483
01:07:21,009 --> 01:07:24,137
杀野猪! 
割喉咙! 打倒它!

484
01:07:24,213 --> 01:07:28,240
杀野猪! 割喉咙! 
打倒它!

485
01:07:39,995 --> 01:07:43,328
杀野猪! 
割喉咙! 打倒它!

486
01:07:43,398 --> 01:07:46,424
杀野猪! 割喉咙! 
打倒它!

487
01:07:46,502 --> 01:07:49,266
杀怪兽!
割喉咙! 打倒它!

488
01:07:49,338 --> 01:07:51,738
杀怪兽!
割喉咙! 打倒它!

489
01:07:51,807 --> 01:07:54,275
杀怪兽!
割喉咙! 打倒它!

490
01:07:54,343 --> 01:07:56,709
杀怪兽!
割喉咙! 打倒它!

491
01:07:56,778 --> 01:07:59,144
杀怪兽!
割喉咙! 打倒它!

492
01:07:59,214 --> 01:08:01,580
杀怪兽!
割喉咙! 打倒它!

493
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:03,641
杀怪兽!
割喉咙! 

494
01:08:05,954 --> 01:08:08,445
<i>杀怪兽!
割喉咙! 打倒它!</i>

495
01:08:08,524 --> 01:08:10,992
<i>杀怪兽!
割喉咙! 打倒它!</i>

496
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:14,051
<i>杀怪兽!
割喉咙! 打倒它!</i>

497
01:08:14,129 --> 01:08:18,759
看! 怪兽!

498
01:08:53,168 --> 01:08:55,136
<i>杀!杀!</i>

499
01:08:55,203 --> 01:08:57,501
<i>杀!杀!杀!</i>

500
01:11:08,704 --> 01:11:12,071
猪仔, 只剩你一个人了 ?

501
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,608
<i>还有一些小孩子.</i>

502
01:11:14,676 --> 01:11:17,645
他们不算数,没有大孩子 ?

503
01:11:18,914 --> 01:11:22,714
<i>哦, Sam 和 Eric.
他们收集木材</i>

504
01:11:22,784 --> 01:11:26,379
<i>- 还有没有人 ?
-  我不知道 .</i>

505
01:11:42,537 --> 01:11:44,471
猪仔.

506
01:11:47,175 --> 01:11:49,302
- 猪仔.
- 唉 ?

507
01:11:49,377 --> 01:11:51,572
那是谋杀.

508
01:11:51,646 --> 01:11:56,208
你吃下去!你做什么都好说,就像 ?

509
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:02,079
那是黑暗,舞蹈,流血!

510
01:12:02,157 --> 01:12:05,888
有雷电雨!

511
01:12:05,961 --> 01:12:08,225
我们受到惊吓!

512
01:12:08,296 --> 01:12:12,528
它不是::你说什么.

513
01:12:12,601 --> 01:12:14,933
哦, 猪仔!

514
01:12:16,004 --> 01:12:19,030
这是一次意外.

515
01:12:25,313 --> 01:12:27,372
他疯了.

516
01:12:27,449 --> 01:12:30,782
他要求.这是一起意外事故.

517
01:12:33,488 --> 01:12:36,082
哦,上帝啊
我要回家.

518
01:12:37,459 --> 01:12:39,859
哦!

519
01:12:39,928 --> 01:12:43,227
<i>哦!哦!</i>

520
01:12:46,334 --> 01:12:48,359
<i>带他走!</i>

521
01:13:03,118 --> 01:13:05,211
明天, 我再去打猎.

522
01:13:06,588 --> 01:13:09,318
我们需要另一个猪头献给怪物.

523
01:13:17,265 --> 01:13:20,598
你留下一些人看守这里.

524
01:13:21,803 --> 01:13:24,670
怪兽会尝试着混进来.

525
01:13:30,645 --> 01:13:32,738
记得上爬行?

526
01:13:32,814 --> 01:13:35,908
<i>他可能会伪装成任何样子.</i>

527
01:13:35,984 --> 01:13:38,919
<i>怪兽会尝试着混进来,</i>

528
01:13:38,987 --> 01:13:42,081
<i>即使我们给它吃猪头,它还是要杀我们.</i>

529
01:13:42,157 --> 01:13:44,387
<i>所以在这里看守并保持清醒.</i>

530
01:13:47,929 --> 01:13:50,523
但是我们不--
我们不--

531
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,426
<i>不,我们如何杀了它 ?</i>

532
01:14:00,442 --> 01:14:04,378
他告诉我们.
怪兽是会伪装的.

533
01:14:06,248 --> 01:14:10,344
明天, 当我们去弄肉时,
我们要去丛林.

534
01:14:12,621 --> 01:14:14,816
- 头头?
- 是的, Bill ?

535
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:17,825
<i>我们用什么点火 ?</i>

536
01:14:17,893 --> 01:14:21,351
我们需要其他的东西点火.

537
01:14:23,331 --> 01:14:25,322
我们去找其他的东西.

538
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,334
你是说什么意思 ?

539
01:14:27,402 --> 01:14:30,132
获救.

540
01:14:30,205 --> 01:14:32,639
这就是我的意思.

541
01:14:32,707 --> 01:14:36,507
如果不尽快离开这儿,我们很快就会变成野人.

542
01:14:36,578 --> 01:14:39,479
- 围绕弯.
- Crackers.

543
01:14:47,989 --> 01:14:50,981
您为什么不给你婶婶写信 ?

544
01:14:51,059 --> 01:14:53,289
我不知道
她现在在哪里,

545
01:14:53,361 --> 01:14:57,263
我没有得到一个信封或邮票,

546
01:14:57,332 --> 01:15:00,699
而且没有一个邮筒或邮差.

547
01:15:02,837 --> 01:15:05,601
我没有说什么很好笑的东西啊.

548
01:15:09,844 --> 01:15:15,680
<i>猪仔-y-y-y!</i>

549
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:17,843
<i>猪仔!</i>

550
01:15:19,821 --> 01:15:22,119
不要出声.

551
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:24,681
<i>他们正在接近我们, 猪仔.</i>

552
01:15:26,761 --> 01:15:28,991
<i>猪仔 ?</i>

553
01:15:29,064 --> 01:15:32,033
<i>你在哪里, 猪仔 ?</i>

554
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,331
<i>- 我们是来取你性命.</i>

555
01:15:45,714 --> 01:15:49,115
哦! 哦! 哦!

556
01:16:03,598 --> 01:16:06,192
<i>猪仔, 你变了!</i>

557
01:16:06,267 --> 01:16:08,758
猪仔!

558
01:17:20,008 --> 01:17:23,375
我只是拿着海螺说话.

559
01:17:23,445 --> 01:17:26,972
我看不见了,眼镜没了,

560
01:17:27,048 --> 01:17:29,949
<i>我要去要回我的眼镜.</i>

561
01:17:30,018 --> 01:17:32,885
<i>我们要去干什么 ?</i>

562
01:17:54,609 --> 01:17:56,702
嗨! 谁在那里 ?

563
01:17:56,778 --> 01:18:00,612
停止无聊的行为!
你看我是谁!

564
01:18:16,264 --> 01:18:18,698
我要求开会!

565
01:18:18,766 --> 01:18:21,098
<i>Boo! Boo!</i>

566
01:18:29,544 --> 01:18:32,206
别离开我, 拉尔夫!

567
01:18:35,016 --> 01:18:38,076
你坐在这里等我. 这里.

568
01:18:44,592 --> 01:18:47,026
你要去哪里 ?

569
01:18:47,095 --> 01:18:51,498
<i>滚开, 拉尔夫!
回你的地盘去.</i>

570
01:18:51,566 --> 01:18:56,196
这是我的地盘和我的部落.
你管不着我.

571
01:18:56,271 --> 01:19:00,230
<i>你们偷了 猪仔的眼镜.
你必须还给他.</i>

572
01:19:00,308 --> 01:19:03,243
还 ? 谁说的?

573
01:19:03,311 --> 01:19:06,371
我说的!
那是一个肮脏把戏.

574
01:19:06,447 --> 01:19:09,382
你随时都可以从我这里取得火种.

575
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:12,351
但是你没有.
你像个贼一样的摸过来.

576
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:15,355
- 再说一遍!
- 贼! 贼!

577
01:19:15,423 --> 01:19:17,550
谁是贼?

578
01:19:17,625 --> 01:19:19,559
你是
579
01:19:20,795 --> 01:19:24,993
拉尔夫!
记得我们来的目的.

580
01:19:25,066 --> 01:19:27,830
火种. 我的眼镜.

581
01:19:27,902 --> 01:19:30,996
你们没看见吗 ? 可能有船或飞机在附近!

582
01:19:38,813 --> 01:19:41,407
- Grab 'em!
-杰克!

583
01:19:41,482 --> 01:19:43,814
<i>Tie 'em up!</i>

584
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:49,089
看 ?
我想他们做什么.

585
01:19:49,157 --> 01:19:52,718
你是一个怪兽、杀人犯、血腥小偷!

586
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:58,364
<i>Boo! Boo!</i>

587
01:19:58,433 --> 01:20:01,129
<i>Go, 杰克! Go!</i>

588
01:20:21,789 --> 01:20:24,280
<i>让我说!</i>

589
01:20:24,359 --> 01:20:26,793
我拿着海螺!

590
01:20:42,644 --> 01:20:45,135
怎样更好 ?

591
01:20:45,213 --> 01:20:49,513
像野人一样...

592
01:20:50,718 --> 01:20:52,982
o或者像拉尔夫一样理智 ?

593
01:20:53,054 --> 01:20:56,285
- 怎样更好?

594
01:20:56,357 --> 01:21:00,623
<i>有规则和认同,或者打猎,杀戮?</i>

595
01:21:11,973 --> 01:21:15,500
- 猪仔!

596
01:22:33,321 --> 01:22:36,256
<i>Sam 和 Eric!
嗨, Sam 和 Eric.</i>

597
01:22:36,324 --> 01:22:38,849
<i>是我拉尔夫.</i>

598
01:22:42,830 --> 01:22:45,230
当他们找到我,那怎么办 ?

599
01:22:46,868 --> 01:22:49,837
Roger把棍子的两头都削尖了.

600
01:22:49,904 --> 01:22:53,169
<i>他们明天就猎杀你.</i>

601
01:22:54,909 --> 01:22:58,037
我们就得给这样的信号: woo-woo-woo!

602
01:22:58,112 --> 01:23:00,307
只有响亮, 就这样.

603
01:23:00,381 --> 01:23:03,009
<i>你去吗, 拉尔夫.</i>

604
01:23:07,088 --> 01:23:09,579
你不会跟我来?

605
01:23:09,657 --> 01:23:13,354
我们3人有较大机会.

606
01:23:13,428 --> 01:23:15,362
Woo-woo-woo-woo!

607
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:16,863
快, 拉尔夫!

608
01:23:16,931 --> 01:23:19,866
我会去树丛.他们不会觉得我躲在这么近的地方.

609
01:23:19,934 --> 01:23:22,334
<i>- 谁在那里?
集中注意!</i>

610
01:23:22,403 --> 01:23:25,133
Eric, 我是 Roger.

611
01:23:25,206 --> 01:23:28,107
