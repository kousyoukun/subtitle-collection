1
00:01:39,054 --> 00:01:41,944
<i>I know the art
of evoking happy moments!</i>

2
00:01:42,094 --> 00:01:45,064
<i>Those scents, those unending kisses,</i>

3
00:01:45,094 --> 00:01:48,018
<i>will they be born again
from that unfathomable abyss,</i>

4
00:01:48,054 --> 00:01:50,136
<i>like a rejuvenated sun
rises in the heaven</i>

5
00:01:50,174 --> 00:01:52,017
<i>from the depths of the sea?</i>

6
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:55,934
<i>O scents, O unending kisses!</i>

7
00:01:56,974 --> 00:01:58,494
<i>The night was growing
dense like a wall</i>

8
00:01:58,974 --> 00:02:00,942
<i>and my eyes glimpsed yours
in the dark.</i>

9
00:02:00,974 --> 00:02:01,975
<i>And I drank your breath</i>

10
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:04,056
<i>O sweetness, O poison</i>-

11
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:07,056
<i>and your feet fell asleep
in my brotherly hands.</i>

12
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,142
<i>"The night was growing dense
like a wall."</i>

13
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:28,514
Is it over?

14
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:30,015
No, it's not.

15
00:02:30,054 --> 00:02:31,175
Come, Jacquot, it's the end.

16
00:02:32,054 --> 00:02:33,180
Sometimes it starts again.

17
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:36,181
No, it doesn't. Let's go.
Papa's waiting...

18
00:02:37,014 --> 00:02:37,981
It's not finished...

19
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:40,935
I'm staying.

20
00:05:05,094 --> 00:05:07,017
Show us yours, Jacquot.

21
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:09,981
What, now?

22
00:05:10,054 --> 00:05:11,135
Don't you worry...

23
00:05:11,934 --> 00:05:13,982
They do it later in the Army

24
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,062
to measure and compare,
so they know.

25
00:05:16,134 --> 00:05:17,101
Know what?

26
00:05:18,174 --> 00:05:19,983
Look out, someone's coming!

27
00:05:20,174 --> 00:05:23,098
Put it back.
It's nothing to write home about.

28
00:05:56,094 --> 00:05:57,983
You three again!

29
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:02,976
Hello boy, homework done?

30
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:05,022
That's right. Is it done?

31
00:06:05,094 --> 00:06:06,016
Not yet, Papa.

32
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:07,180
Do what your father says.

33
00:06:07,974 --> 00:06:09,135
Hurry up, Madame Marilou...

34
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:13,017
5 litres exactly.

35
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:14,135
You're tops.

36
00:06:18,054 --> 00:06:21,103
- Hurry! Only one side is curled...
- I'm coming!

37
00:06:21,134 --> 00:06:23,057
I'm on stage in an hour.

38
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:31,977
<i>Papa didn't want it,</i>

39
00:06:32,054 --> 00:06:33,055
<i>Mama neither.</i>

40
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:34,983
<i>Good little children</i>

41
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:36,180
<i>Obey their parents.</i>

42
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:47,945
- That's in Act 2.
- Yes. It's the donkey duet.

43
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:50,977
The curler is too hot.

44
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:55,016
Come down.
Stay away from that ladder.

45
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:56,938
Done your homework?

46
00:06:57,094 --> 00:06:59,142
I left my bag in the garage.

47
00:07:03,094 --> 00:07:04,983
- It's fixed?
- Yes.

48
00:07:08,974 --> 00:07:11,136
It clunks when it's cold,
but that's normal.

49
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:12,975
Thanks.

50
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:56,140
Hello, Demy Garage here...

51
00:07:56,974 --> 00:07:58,100
I want to order a new car.

52
00:07:58,174 --> 00:08:00,984
A black Citroén 7 CV.

53
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,062
The customer's in a hurry.

54
00:08:12,014 --> 00:08:12,981
Damn kids...

55
00:08:14,134 --> 00:08:16,102
Always blocking the stairs.

56
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:22,102
Jacquot! I hate being late.

57
00:08:22,174 --> 00:08:24,017
I wanted an orange.

58
00:09:00,134 --> 00:09:02,023
Goodnight, Papa.

59
00:09:03,974 --> 00:09:05,976
You should've come with us.

60
00:09:06,054 --> 00:09:07,214
I know "Les Saltimbanques"...

61
00:09:14,974 --> 00:09:17,056
You know, the one Mama curls...

62
00:09:17,094 --> 00:09:22,100
<i>It is love
that consoles the poor...</i>

63
00:09:22,174 --> 00:09:23,983
In bed, "the poor".

64
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:32,022
"Say YOU!" prayers.

65
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:38,978
Our Father who art in Heaven...

66
00:09:44,974 --> 00:09:46,100
They are good boys.

67
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:49,136
Hail Mary full of grace...

68
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,056
Coming to give us a kiss, Mama?

69
00:10:20,174 --> 00:10:23,144
A rich labourer,
knowing his death was imminent,

70
00:10:23,974 --> 00:10:25,942
called his children in...

71
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:29,056
and addressed them without witness.

72
00:10:29,134 --> 00:10:32,058
Be sure not to sell
what is ours, he said.

73
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:35,974
There is a treasure hidden within.

74
00:10:37,974 --> 00:10:40,102
<i>Jacques' childhood was his treasure</i>

75
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:43,064
<i>and</i> a <i>source of inspiration
for his films.</i>

76
00:10:43,174 --> 00:10:45,063
Now then...

77
00:10:45,094 --> 00:10:46,175
let me write.

78
00:10:49,054 --> 00:10:52,979
<i>He was writing about his memories
and he talked about them a tot.</i>

79
00:10:53,054 --> 00:10:54,180
<i>Anecdotes came back,</i>

80
00:10:54,974 --> 00:10:55,975
<i>forgotten names</i>

81
00:10:56,054 --> 00:10:58,056
<i>and suddenly remembered details.</i>

82
00:11:01,054 --> 00:11:03,102
<i>He spoke of the little kitchen,</i>

83
00:11:03,174 --> 00:11:05,063
<i>the focus of family life.</i>

84
00:11:08,054 --> 00:11:09,977
<i>And above all of his mother,</i>

85
00:11:10,014 --> 00:11:12,062
<i>who was the life and soul of it.</i>

86
00:11:19,134 --> 00:11:22,980
<i>Do you remember our last date?</i>

87
00:11:29,014 --> 00:11:31,176
<i>He liked remembering
Sunday outings,</i>

88
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:34,056
<i>when time passed slowly.</i>

89
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:37,058
<i>He had known what he called
"a happy childhood".</i>

90
00:11:59,014 --> 00:12:02,143
<i>Jacques recalled
the arrival of a country cousin</i>

91
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:07,101
<i>that a Brazilian industrialist
had turned into an upmarket tart.</i>

92
00:12:08,014 --> 00:12:09,095
Wait here.

93
00:12:10,014 --> 00:12:12,938
Hey, good-looking,
is this Raymond's garage?

94
00:12:13,054 --> 00:12:14,943
Raymond's my father.
What do you want?

95
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:16,095
You don't know me,

96
00:12:16,174 --> 00:12:18,017
but I'm your aunt from Rio.

97
00:12:19,174 --> 00:12:20,938
Papa!

98
00:12:21,014 --> 00:12:22,982
Someone to see you, Boss.

99
00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:24,056
That's him.

100
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:25,983
Oh, it's you.

101
00:12:26,054 --> 00:12:27,943
You look terrific.

102
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:31,937
Come and meet the wife.

103
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:37,985
It's that cousin I told you about,
who went off to Brazil.

104
00:12:39,974 --> 00:12:41,100
Don't touch, it's organza.

105
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:42,983
At last I know the whole family.

106
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:46,058
I'll take you all
to La Cigale tonight.

107
00:12:47,174 --> 00:12:49,017
Come here, you.

108
00:12:49,054 --> 00:12:50,977
You're invited too.

109
00:12:51,054 --> 00:12:52,977
Now I can kiss you...

110
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:58,022
Oops! It's my lipstick.

111
00:13:01,054 --> 00:13:02,135
Shall I sing you a song?

112
00:13:02,974 --> 00:13:04,055
For God's sake, don't get up.

113
00:13:04,134 --> 00:13:06,136
Go on, sing Papa.

114
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:10,136
You didn't miss our local wine?

115
00:13:10,974 --> 00:13:13,136
Yes, I often think of "Gros Plant".

116
00:13:13,174 --> 00:13:16,178
One day a producer said
I ought to be in the movies.

117
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:19,061
So I did tests.

118
00:13:19,094 --> 00:13:21,938
But "Gros Plan" means "Close-up"...

119
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,056
I thought he was
offering white wine!

120
00:13:26,094 --> 00:13:27,095
Let's drink to that!

121
00:13:29,014 --> 00:13:30,095
Cheers!

122
00:13:33,974 --> 00:13:35,021
Beautiful diamonds...

123
00:13:35,094 --> 00:13:37,062
Yes. So extravagant...

124
00:13:37,094 --> 00:13:38,175
I've been spoiled too.

125
00:13:39,014 --> 00:13:40,175
You really shouldn't have...

126
00:13:40,974 --> 00:13:42,135
Don't you criticise me...

127
00:13:43,174 --> 00:13:45,939
No, I'm pleased with my present.

128
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:49,103
I adore casinos,
particularly roulette...

129
00:13:49,134 --> 00:13:52,934
I had a run of good luck.
I just kept on winning.

130
00:13:53,174 --> 00:13:56,974
That means presents for everyone...
me too.

131
00:14:19,054 --> 00:14:20,101
You came on your own?

132
00:14:20,174 --> 00:14:23,018
I'm joining Bill Schuster in Munich.

133
00:14:23,054 --> 00:14:24,977
He's the right sort.

134
00:14:26,134 --> 00:14:29,104
First, I'd like to visit
Grandpa's grave.

135
00:14:29,174 --> 00:14:32,018
I wasn't here when he passed on.

136
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:43,063
<i>I will wait for you</i>

137
00:14:44,094 --> 00:14:48,065
<i>night and day</i>

138
00:14:52,974 --> 00:14:55,944
<i>until your return...</i>

139
00:15:21,014 --> 00:15:23,984
<i>I'm the one who laughs...</i>

140
00:15:24,054 --> 00:15:26,102
<i>Who wants to please...</i>

141
00:15:26,174 --> 00:15:27,175
<i>I'm Lola.</i>

142
00:16:16,014 --> 00:16:17,175
That's my name.

143
00:16:17,974 --> 00:16:20,978
We gave you your Grandpa's name,

144
00:16:21,054 --> 00:16:23,102
but for me you're my little Jacquot.

145
00:16:29,014 --> 00:16:31,176
<i>Seeing my name there
when I was so young</i>

146
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:35,103
<i>gave me a sense of the fragility
of our existence.</i>

147
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:53,102
Ah, how lucky I am!

148
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:57,143
I saw a little old lady
and grabbed her handbag.

149
00:16:57,174 --> 00:17:00,098
I'm as slippery as an eel.

150
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:03,181
- Guignol...!
- He's stolen a bag!

151
00:17:03,974 --> 00:17:05,021
I saw a policeman...

152
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:07,142
so I've hidden it.

153
00:17:07,174 --> 00:17:09,017
Here he comes!

154
00:17:09,134 --> 00:17:11,944
Good day, Guignol.

155
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:13,175
Good day, Gnafron.

156
00:17:13,974 --> 00:17:15,976
Good day, Brigadier.

157
00:17:16,054 --> 00:17:18,056
I say, you wouldn't have seen

158
00:17:18,094 --> 00:17:20,017
a suspicious individual?

159
00:17:20,094 --> 00:17:22,096
A bag snatcher!

160
00:17:22,134 --> 00:17:23,977
Did any of you children

161
00:17:24,054 --> 00:17:25,180
see him around here?

162
00:17:25,974 --> 00:17:27,180
He hid it under a bush!

163
00:17:31,974 --> 00:17:33,134
Are you doing that for Reine?

164
00:17:33,174 --> 00:17:35,176
It still smells of coffee in here.

165
00:17:40,054 --> 00:17:42,022
What are you, a tortoise?

166
00:17:42,054 --> 00:17:43,977
None of your business.

167
00:17:44,014 --> 00:17:45,140
Can I keep this box?

168
00:17:45,974 --> 00:17:47,021
Take it if you like.

169
00:17:47,094 --> 00:17:49,176
I want to make a puppet theatre.

170
00:17:55,134 --> 00:17:58,024
What I hear about Munich's
not good.

171
00:17:58,054 --> 00:18:00,136
I wonder about that cousin from Rio.

172
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:04,984
Off to see her Mr Schuster...
Probably a spy.

173
00:18:05,094 --> 00:18:07,017
Yet she seemed sweet and kind.

174
00:18:08,094 --> 00:18:12,179
How could anything go well?
Why go at all? And where?

175
00:18:13,014 --> 00:18:15,062
Madame de Saint-Clair is here.

176
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:22,059
I feel like tapering it at the neck.

177
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:26,055
Mr Cavalet is home.

178
00:18:26,174 --> 00:18:27,983
Will that do?

179
00:18:28,094 --> 00:18:29,141
Almost...

180
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:32,096
I'll just give it one last comb...

181
00:18:36,174 --> 00:18:38,097
You made a Negro policeman?

182
00:18:38,134 --> 00:18:39,101
No, I didn't.

183
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:40,977
Why's he black then?

184
00:18:41,014 --> 00:18:43,062
The potatoes go black.

185
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:48,935
I know...

186
00:18:49,134 --> 00:18:51,944
I'll make the heads
out of cardboard.

187
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:54,022
Come along, everyone!

188
00:18:54,094 --> 00:18:56,017
Hurry up, please!

189
00:18:56,174 --> 00:18:58,142
Next show in 15 minutes!

190
00:18:58,974 --> 00:19:00,021
Snow White is pretty.

191
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,016
I liked the witch.

192
00:19:03,094 --> 00:19:04,937
I knew you would.

193
00:19:07,054 --> 00:19:08,180
Grumpy's always grumpy.

194
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,061
He didn't stop sneezing.

195
00:19:10,134 --> 00:19:11,977
That was Sneezy, dopey!

196
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:14,057
You must see the film.

197
00:19:14,134 --> 00:19:16,102
It's terrific and scary.

198
00:19:16,134 --> 00:19:19,980
My father promised to take me
if I get good marks.

199
00:19:20,014 --> 00:19:21,982
I'm going again tomorrow.

200
00:19:22,014 --> 00:19:23,140
Me too. I'm going on Sunday.

201
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:26,056
Hello. I've seen it too.

202
00:19:26,094 --> 00:19:27,983
I like the witch best.

203
00:19:28,014 --> 00:19:30,016
He's got a crush on Snow White.

204
00:19:30,094 --> 00:19:31,016
Don't say that.

205
00:19:31,134 --> 00:19:33,136
You said the other day
she was for you.

206
00:19:33,174 --> 00:19:35,142
I didn't, but she's not bad.

207
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,144
She always sings
when she sweeps...

208
00:19:38,174 --> 00:19:40,063
when she washes up...

209
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:42,978
and when she bakes cakes.

210
00:19:51,134 --> 00:19:54,024
Mirror, mirror on the wall...

211
00:19:54,134 --> 00:19:58,184
<i>I met three lads from my hometown</i>

212
00:19:59,014 --> 00:20:00,982
<i>I was kissed by the youngest</i>

213
00:20:02,014 --> 00:20:03,982
<i>Who was also the handsomest</i>

214
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:05,943
<i>He took me to his room</i>

215
00:20:06,054 --> 00:20:08,056
<i>To talk of our hometown...</i>

216
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:20,939
<i>A whole bowl</i>

217
00:20:21,134 --> 00:20:23,102
<i>A whole bowl of milk</i>

218
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:25,057
<i>Nice and creamy</i>

219
00:20:26,054 --> 00:20:28,102
<i>Nice and creamy, please</i>

220
00:20:28,134 --> 00:20:31,934
<i>Some sifted sugar</i>

221
00:20:32,014 --> 00:20:34,062
<i>And then you mix</i>

222
00:20:34,974 --> 00:20:36,976
<i>You mix it well</i>

223
00:20:40,054 --> 00:20:42,056
Mama, they're outside!

224
00:20:49,174 --> 00:20:52,018
Come see, there are giant dwarfs.

225
00:20:53,174 --> 00:20:55,939
You've got them all, even Dopey.

226
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,101
A bit of chocolate?

227
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:58,983
Yes, please.

228
00:20:59,014 --> 00:21:01,016
You're lucky to have them all.

229
00:21:03,014 --> 00:21:04,095
Haven't you got Snow White?

230
00:21:04,174 --> 00:21:07,018
No, I don't care
two hoots about her.

231
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:09,142
She can't do the splits.

232
00:21:09,174 --> 00:21:10,983
I can.

233
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:13,055
You try.

234
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:17,056
Go on, clumsy, try again.

235
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:20,100
Push downwards...

236
00:21:20,134 --> 00:21:22,057
Stretch your legs...

237
00:21:22,174 --> 00:21:24,984
We could work up
an acrobatics act

238
00:21:25,054 --> 00:21:26,294
and tour the world in a circus.

239
00:21:27,014 --> 00:21:27,936
If you like.

240
00:21:27,974 --> 00:21:29,021
Keep trying-

241
00:21:30,014 --> 00:21:30,981
Push!

242
00:21:31,054 --> 00:21:34,024
Keep it rolling with your stick...

243
00:21:37,134 --> 00:21:39,057
The Three Musketeers!

244
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:50,057
<i>I've got my Pal...</i>

245
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:51,943
Pass me a spanner.

246
00:21:52,014 --> 00:21:54,142
<i>Let me treat you
to a lakeside lunch...</i>

247
00:21:54,174 --> 00:21:55,983
Can you manage?

248
00:21:57,974 --> 00:22:01,103
<i>Caroline, Caroline!</i>

249
00:22:01,174 --> 00:22:04,098
<i>Put your best shoes on...</i>

250
00:22:07,014 --> 00:22:09,016
It's war! Mobilisation!

251
00:22:10,054 --> 00:22:12,022
That's all what we needed!

252
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:14,023
God knows where I'll be sent.

253
00:22:16,054 --> 00:22:18,056
You with your bad leg,
you'll stay here.

254
00:22:22,014 --> 00:22:25,097
Take those sacks to the cellars
for a shelter.

255
00:22:25,174 --> 00:22:27,142
We need some in the attics too.

256
00:22:27,174 --> 00:22:29,142
If my two sons go off to war...

257
00:22:29,174 --> 00:22:31,142
They'll test gas masks
at school.

258
00:22:32,134 --> 00:22:34,023
Reine will look like a fly.

259
00:22:34,094 --> 00:22:35,061
Me. A fly?

260
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:37,978
You have a fly up your nose
and Jacquot too.

261
00:22:38,174 --> 00:22:40,984
You'd be a beautiful fly.

262
00:22:43,174 --> 00:22:46,064
I've given him a big moustache.

263
00:22:54,174 --> 00:22:56,984
Look, will that do you?

264
00:22:57,054 --> 00:22:58,055
Oh, yes.

265
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:00,977
It fits.

266
00:23:07,134 --> 00:23:09,102
She's the one with the hair.

267
00:23:12,094 --> 00:23:14,142
- You don't hit puppets.
- Just a bit.

268
00:23:15,054 --> 00:23:16,180
You think it's here?

269
00:23:18,054 --> 00:23:20,944
- Demy, Raymond Marcel?
- That's me.

270
00:23:21,094 --> 00:23:23,017
It's your posting.

271
00:23:23,134 --> 00:23:25,136
The arsenal isn't very far.

272
00:23:26,094 --> 00:23:28,017
I'll be home every night.

273
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:33,056
Better to make shells
than be hit by them.

274
00:23:35,134 --> 00:23:37,978
Do you think they're asleep? Check.

275
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:41,935
They're fine.

276
00:23:55,974 --> 00:23:59,057
- Makes a change from a beret.
- Good luck, neighbour.

277
00:24:01,934 --> 00:24:03,060
Your lunch bag...

278
00:24:28,094 --> 00:24:29,016
Grandma,

279
00:24:29,054 --> 00:24:31,056
can you make a cape
for my puppet?

280
00:24:31,134 --> 00:24:35,139
Not black like that,
but with this shiny cloth?

281
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:38,098
Of course, Jacquot,
but I must finish this.

282
00:24:38,174 --> 00:24:40,097
Look at these pearls...

283
00:24:41,174 --> 00:24:43,984
The woman's coming
for it tomorrow.

284
00:24:44,014 --> 00:24:45,937
Then you can do mine next.

285
00:24:50,174 --> 00:24:51,175
Sing me another song.

286
00:24:51,974 --> 00:24:53,055
I like your songs.

287
00:24:54,094 --> 00:24:58,975
<i>There was a king</i>

288
00:24:59,094 --> 00:25:02,177
<i>who remained faithful</i>

289
00:25:03,054 --> 00:25:07,139
<i>to his beloved</i>

290
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:10,181
<i>and left her a golden goblet...</i>

291
00:25:15,054 --> 00:25:17,136
- Do you know about witches?
- Not really.

292
00:25:17,174 --> 00:25:19,097
They fly on broomsticks.

293
00:25:19,174 --> 00:25:21,097
Do they wear Japanese Kimonos?

294
00:25:21,134 --> 00:25:23,102
You know all about costumes.

295
00:25:23,934 --> 00:25:25,095
There's Grandma...

296
00:25:25,174 --> 00:25:26,141
and Jacquot!

297
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:32,018
<i>Four for Cinderella.</i>

298
00:25:32,094 --> 00:25:34,096
Coming, my little ones,
my elephants...

299
00:25:54,974 --> 00:25:55,975
Coupons?

300
00:25:56,174 --> 00:25:57,983
150 francs. Fine.

301
00:26:16,014 --> 00:26:18,062
In Germany
they've requisitioned cars.

302
00:26:18,134 --> 00:26:21,058
My husband wrote to hide ours.
I can't decide.

303
00:26:21,094 --> 00:26:22,983
- Where is he?
- The Maginot Line.

304
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,982
Mine's busy making shells.

305
00:26:25,054 --> 00:26:27,056
But he does get home every night.

306
00:26:45,014 --> 00:26:45,981
What is it?

307
00:26:46,054 --> 00:26:47,977
My guests haven't come.

308
00:26:48,014 --> 00:26:48,936
Patience.

309
00:26:49,014 --> 00:26:49,981
Go look.

310
00:26:51,134 --> 00:26:53,057
Hang on, I've had an idea.

311
00:27:09,054 --> 00:27:11,102
Ready, children and elephants?

312
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:14,063
Off we go. Open the curtains.

313
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:16,023
And here is Cinderella.

314
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,023
I'm so unhappy...

315
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:21,018
My wicked sisters
have gone to the ball

316
00:27:21,054 --> 00:27:23,022
and I'm cleaning up the cinders.

317
00:27:23,094 --> 00:27:24,016
Poor girl.

318
00:27:24,054 --> 00:27:24,976
Here I am.

319
00:27:25,094 --> 00:27:26,983
I am the Fairy.

320
00:27:27,094 --> 00:27:28,983
The Lilac Fairy.

321
00:27:29,094 --> 00:27:31,938
Want to go to the ball?
Just watch.

322
00:27:36,094 --> 00:27:39,018
Don't forget to leave
at midnight.

323
00:27:39,054 --> 00:27:41,182
First, I'll change your dress.

324
00:27:41,974 --> 00:27:43,135
Here comes the stardust.

325
00:27:44,974 --> 00:27:46,976
That's not stars, it's sand.

326
00:27:47,054 --> 00:27:48,135
You're lice-ridden!

327
00:27:48,974 --> 00:27:50,180
Look at the state of you!

328
00:27:50,974 --> 00:27:52,180
Bend over the newspaper.

329
00:27:52,974 --> 00:27:55,978
You know those Marchis kids
are full of lice.

330
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,098
They clapped, Mama,
and René and I bowed.

331
00:28:00,134 --> 00:28:01,943
They're everywhere.

332
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,140
Let me see.

333
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,022
You can't. They're too small.

334
00:28:07,094 --> 00:28:09,062
I'll put some lotion on later.

335
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:24,104
- I've only got 1 left.
- I won these.

336
00:28:24,134 --> 00:28:25,977
- You stole them.
- Don't argue.

337
00:28:26,054 --> 00:28:27,977
Mind your own business, Demy.

338
00:28:28,014 --> 00:28:31,143
- Give them back.
- No, I won them. You're the cheat.

339
00:28:31,174 --> 00:28:34,974
Don't argue.
We'd better go, or we'll be late.

340
00:28:35,974 --> 00:28:36,941
See you later.

341
00:28:41,134 --> 00:28:43,978
Look, Demy, a new poster!

342
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:46,016
"Silence.
Enemy ears are listening."

343
00:28:47,014 --> 00:28:48,175
Are there enemies everywhere?

344
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:50,135
It's no joke...

345
00:28:50,934 --> 00:28:54,063
Grandma and Mama read a book
called Mr Spy and His Daughter.

346
00:28:54,974 --> 00:28:57,102
The spies were disguised as nuns.

347
00:28:58,094 --> 00:28:59,254
You had to check their shoes.

348
00:28:59,934 --> 00:29:00,981
Hurry up. You m!

349
00:29:05,054 --> 00:29:06,977
Don't dawdle, Demy!

350
00:29:07,174 --> 00:29:09,063
- This OK?
- Fine.

351
00:29:09,174 --> 00:29:10,096
Mask on.

352
00:29:11,974 --> 00:29:15,945
If there's a real alert,
I want no dawdling and no fuss.

353
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:20,943
Nuns!

354
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,937
Let's go check!

355
00:29:58,014 --> 00:29:59,140
Come with me to the toilet.

356
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:00,983
Can't you go on your own?

357
00:30:01,054 --> 00:30:02,135
I'm frightened.

358
00:30:13,134 --> 00:30:15,136
I'm going to explore the cave...

359
00:30:16,094 --> 00:30:18,176
There's a glow in the distance...

360
00:30:18,974 --> 00:30:20,100
Jacquot, come back!

361
00:30:22,134 --> 00:30:24,102
It's as dark as Hell in there.

362
00:30:24,134 --> 00:30:26,023
What's Hell?

363
00:30:59,054 --> 00:31:01,102
I want to go to the fair.

364
00:31:01,934 --> 00:31:03,140
It's for soldiers on leave.

365
00:31:03,974 --> 00:31:05,135
Let's go to the Guignol.

366
00:31:05,174 --> 00:31:07,142
We'll take a quick look first.

367
00:31:10,174 --> 00:31:12,142
Hitler's head for 5 francs!

368
00:31:17,934 --> 00:31:20,016
- Now we go to the Guignol!
- Now?

369
00:31:20,934 --> 00:31:21,981
You're good, Father dear,

370
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:23,983
but before I marry you,

371
00:31:24,054 --> 00:31:26,182
I want the skin of that old donkey.

372
00:31:26,974 --> 00:31:28,100
My banker donkey? Never!

373
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:30,982
I insist, Father dear.

374
00:31:31,054 --> 00:31:33,056
I can't possibly refuse you.

375
00:31:33,134 --> 00:31:35,023
I say there!

376
00:31:36,054 --> 00:31:37,943
Kill my donkey

377
00:31:38,014 --> 00:31:39,982
and bring me his skin.

378
00:31:40,054 --> 00:31:41,175
They won't really kill it...

379
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:46,101
How dreadful!

380
00:31:47,134 --> 00:31:48,977
It's disgusting.

381
00:31:49,054 --> 00:31:52,103
Tell me, my fairy godmother,
what shall I do?

382
00:31:54,094 --> 00:31:55,095
Disguise yourself...

383
00:31:56,174 --> 00:31:57,983
You have bizarre ideas.

384
00:31:58,174 --> 00:32:00,097
Come on, hurry.

385
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:08,136
- Put this skin on.
- Awful!

386
00:32:08,174 --> 00:32:10,939
Just do as I tell you.

387
00:32:13,054 --> 00:32:16,183
From now on, we'll call you:
Donkey Skin.

388
00:32:45,014 --> 00:32:47,096
Mama, there's no more school!

389
00:32:47,134 --> 00:32:48,943
Due to the war.

390
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:50,015
Watch out.

391
00:32:55,054 --> 00:32:56,943
Is the garage Open?

392
00:32:57,054 --> 00:33:00,103
Not really...
Maybe the mechanic can help.

393
00:33:02,054 --> 00:33:04,136
Can I have some water?

394
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:16,175
Been on the road long?

395
00:33:16,974 --> 00:33:18,100
We've driven from Bruges.

396
00:33:19,134 --> 00:33:20,977
Come in for a moment.

397
00:33:22,094 --> 00:33:23,983
We ran for it.

398
00:33:24,014 --> 00:33:28,064
People said they were raping women
and cutting off children's hands.

399
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:30,176
We left in a panic.

400
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:36,056
Too late, Madame Demy.
We're closing.

401
00:33:36,094 --> 00:33:37,983
For good?

402
00:33:38,054 --> 00:33:40,022
The Germans will soon be here.

403
00:33:40,054 --> 00:33:41,943
They ransack. They kill.

404
00:33:42,014 --> 00:33:43,061
We're leaving.

405
00:33:43,134 --> 00:33:44,977
All of you?

406
00:33:45,054 --> 00:33:47,022
We're going back to the farm.

407
00:33:48,094 --> 00:33:49,095
Are you off too?

408
00:33:49,174 --> 00:33:50,141
I don't know.

409
00:33:55,974 --> 00:33:57,135
Do you want to leave?

410
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:00,180
I don't know.

411
00:34:07,134 --> 00:34:10,024
The Germans are coming.
Are we going or not?

412
00:34:10,054 --> 00:34:11,180
Where to...?

413
00:34:12,174 --> 00:34:14,097
I can't leave Grandma.

414
00:34:35,214 --> 00:34:37,023
Can you help us?

415
00:34:37,094 --> 00:34:39,096
Lend us some civilian clothes.

416
00:34:39,134 --> 00:34:41,023
Sorry, we're leaving...

417
00:34:41,094 --> 00:34:42,095
Over here, boys!

418
00:34:47,174 --> 00:34:49,097
Get some overalls.

419
00:34:51,014 --> 00:34:53,062
We don't even know
if we're still at war.

420
00:35:02,174 --> 00:35:03,938
Catch.

421
00:35:07,054 --> 00:35:07,976
Here.

422
00:35:08,054 --> 00:35:09,135
Thanks, boy.

423
00:35:25,174 --> 00:35:27,097
- Isn't Reine here?
- No.

424
00:35:28,974 --> 00:35:30,942
She's staying with my sister.

425
00:35:31,094 --> 00:35:32,141
No news of your husband?

426
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:33,978
I'm still waiting.

427
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:37,018
I worry, but I go to work.

428
00:35:46,934 --> 00:35:48,015
I'll translate for you...

429
00:35:59,134 --> 00:36:01,057
German's a weird language.

430
00:36:01,094 --> 00:36:04,064
Hush! Look at the poster...

431
00:36:09,054 --> 00:36:11,022
You're taking them to the river'?

432
00:36:11,054 --> 00:36:13,944
Yes, I've got to pick up
some mattresses.

433
00:36:14,094 --> 00:36:15,983
They'll keep the girl company.

434
00:36:16,014 --> 00:36:17,937
Don't let them swim on their own!

435
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:19,095
Don't you worry.

436
00:36:20,014 --> 00:36:21,015
Off we go!

437
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:23,061
You get in here.

438
00:36:23,094 --> 00:36:24,983
René, you climb in the back.

439
00:36:28,174 --> 00:36:30,176
She's a refugee,
from friends of friends.

440
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:34,018
<i>She was a wonder
from Sainte-Geneviéve-des-Bois</i>

441
00:36:34,054 --> 00:36:36,056
<i>and very pretty indeed.</i>

442
00:36:36,174 --> 00:36:37,141
No, not like that.

443
00:36:37,214 --> 00:36:39,023
Like this.

444
00:36:44,974 --> 00:36:45,975
What's your name?

445
00:36:46,054 --> 00:36:49,024
Geneviéve from
Sainte-Geneviéve-des-Bois.

446
00:36:52,054 --> 00:36:54,056
You have to move your arms more.

447
00:37:19,094 --> 00:37:21,017
Shall we show her the stairs?

448
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:31,062
Then, there's a little staircase.

449
00:37:31,174 --> 00:37:32,141
Coming?

450
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,062
You keep watch.

451
00:37:54,094 --> 00:37:55,937
My turn.

452
00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:26,942
The witch's door is open.

453
00:38:26,974 --> 00:38:28,976
Maybe it was burglars.

454
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:31,015
Let's look inside.

455
00:38:33,054 --> 00:38:33,976
Can I see?

456
00:38:36,054 --> 00:38:37,101
Do you think she's dead?

457
00:38:53,054 --> 00:38:55,056
<i>It's him again.</i>

458
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:58,057
<i>The metallurgist.</i>

459
00:38:59,054 --> 00:39:00,180
<i>It's him.</i>

460
00:39:03,094 --> 00:39:06,064
<i>It's wonderful.</i>

461
00:39:07,174 --> 00:39:10,974
<i>Hush, don't say a word.</i>

462
00:39:29,054 --> 00:39:30,055
Don't worry.

463
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:32,102
It'll be fun.

464
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:34,095
We won't be able to play cars.

465
00:39:34,174 --> 00:39:35,983
Then play cars now.

466
00:39:36,054 --> 00:39:37,055
Off we go!

467
00:39:41,014 --> 00:39:43,016
We're going for a drive.

468
00:39:43,054 --> 00:39:44,977
Along the banks of the Loire.

469
00:39:45,014 --> 00:39:47,096
Careful. I can't swim.

470
00:39:57,134 --> 00:39:58,135
Put that down.

471
00:39:58,174 --> 00:40:00,097
You mustn't touch everything.

472
00:40:00,134 --> 00:40:02,057
They've got to have fun.

473
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:03,943
It's all new to them.

474
00:40:06,094 --> 00:40:08,017
What's this for?

475
00:40:08,054 --> 00:40:11,183
Pouring water on the grindstone
to sharpen the tools.

476
00:40:12,174 --> 00:40:14,063
If you're thirsty, drink.

477
00:40:14,094 --> 00:40:16,096
I've brought their things.

478
00:40:17,974 --> 00:40:20,944
Old George told me
to take kids from Nantes.

479
00:40:21,974 --> 00:40:24,022
He told me the clog-maker
is a good man.

480
00:40:24,094 --> 00:40:25,175
Looks like he was right.

481
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:28,141
They seem pale.

482
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:31,022
The fresh air will do them good.

483
00:40:43,934 --> 00:40:45,060
We don't see the war here.

484
00:40:45,134 --> 00:40:47,057
Except there's no tobacco.

485
00:40:47,974 --> 00:40:50,022
- I'll give you money.
- Later.

486
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:51,937
We'd better go.

487
00:40:52,214 --> 00:40:54,023
I've never left them.

488
00:40:54,054 --> 00:40:56,136
Don't fret. We'll look after them.

489
00:41:02,014 --> 00:41:04,176
Come on.
Let's go feed the rabbits.

490
00:41:04,974 --> 00:41:06,976
I want to feed the rabbits too.

491
00:41:15,934 --> 00:41:18,016
- Bye, children.
- Bye.

492
00:41:34,934 --> 00:41:37,062
You don't cut yourself
on that knife?

493
00:41:37,134 --> 00:41:40,104
I've been making clogs
for 30 years.

494
00:42:06,014 --> 00:42:07,937
Home we go, little fellow.

495
00:42:11,014 --> 00:42:12,015
<i>"My darlings,"</i>

496
00:42:12,054 --> 00:42:13,977
<i>"Here are some transfers"</i>

497
00:42:14,014 --> 00:42:16,984
"...and a badge
of the arms of Nantes,"

498
00:42:17,054 --> 00:42:19,102
"since you said you wanted a badge."

499
00:42:19,134 --> 00:42:21,023
"Say hello to Aunt Léa"

500
00:42:21,054 --> 00:42:22,055
"and the clog-maker."

501
00:42:22,214 --> 00:42:24,103
"Big kiss from Papa and Mama,"

502
00:42:24,134 --> 00:42:25,181
"Marilou."

503
00:42:35,934 --> 00:42:36,454
Not bad, huh?

504
00:42:37,134 --> 00:42:38,181
Your badge is great.

505
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:40,942
They don't have them in the country.

506
00:42:41,014 --> 00:42:41,981
Where'd you get it?

507
00:42:42,054 --> 00:42:43,175
Little Demy... You've grown!

508
00:42:43,974 --> 00:42:45,055
The country air has done you good.

509
00:42:45,174 --> 00:42:47,063
Here's the washing.

510
00:42:47,094 --> 00:42:49,142
Thank you.
Goodbye, Madame Le Dentec.

511
00:42:54,054 --> 00:42:56,056
It's nice to have you back.

512
00:42:58,174 --> 00:43:00,222
Jacquot,
take your beret off at table.

513
00:43:02,014 --> 00:43:05,063
I've made a real feast:
pasta with cheese and sausage,

514
00:43:05,134 --> 00:43:07,023
from the sausage lady.

515
00:43:07,094 --> 00:43:09,176
- Luce, who sings in church?
- Yes.

516
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:12,056
Glad to be home, boys?

517
00:43:12,934 --> 00:43:13,434
Yes, Papa.

518
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:17,183
I want to go to the cinema
and the circus.

519
00:43:17,974 --> 00:43:19,374
I'll take you, or your father will.

520
00:43:19,974 --> 00:43:21,135
All Papa likes is boules!

521
00:43:24,974 --> 00:43:26,976
It feels good. We're a family.

522
00:43:28,974 --> 00:43:31,944
Back to catechism class.
First Communion in May.

523
00:43:32,134 --> 00:43:33,101
Yes, Mama!

524
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,061
You're late...

525
00:43:38,134 --> 00:43:40,136
Catechism went on for ever.

526
00:43:40,974 --> 00:43:43,978
I know. So I hope you pass
your First Communion test.

527
00:43:44,134 --> 00:43:47,058
- Your sister passed first time.
- He knows.

528
00:43:47,134 --> 00:43:49,978
He knows his catechism.
At least, I hope so.

529
00:43:56,974 --> 00:43:59,102
Can you help us fix up a trapeze?

530
00:43:59,134 --> 00:44:02,024
I'd better ask your Papa,
or you ask Guy.

531
00:44:05,054 --> 00:44:06,180
This beam?

532
00:44:11,014 --> 00:44:13,096
"Lift up your souls,
yet remain modest",

533
00:44:13,174 --> 00:44:15,097
as our priest says.

534
00:44:19,134 --> 00:44:21,102
- Missed!
- Your turn!

535
00:44:26,094 --> 00:44:27,983
You will do it, Robert?

536
00:44:28,054 --> 00:44:29,135
Yes, later.

537
00:44:34,174 --> 00:44:36,176
Look at Reine's shutters.
Is she not back?

538
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:39,978
We don't see much of her.
She's taken on airs.

539
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:43,142
Feldkommandant Holt
was shot in the back.

540
00:44:43,974 --> 00:44:45,055
There's a curfew at 4 p.m.

541
00:44:46,134 --> 00:44:47,943
There'll be reprisals.

542
00:44:48,014 --> 00:44:49,937
It happened on Rue du Roi Albert.

543
00:44:50,014 --> 00:44:52,062
- On your way to catechism...
- Yes, that's it.

544
00:44:53,174 --> 00:44:57,020
<i>"Cowardly criminals
working for England and Moscow..."</i>

545
00:44:57,134 --> 00:45:00,980
"...shot the Nantes Feldkommandant
in the back..."

546
00:45:01,094 --> 00:45:02,175
"on 20 October."

547
00:45:02,974 --> 00:45:04,976
<i>"The murderers have not been caught."</i>

548
00:45:05,174 --> 00:45:07,017
<i>"To punish this crime"</i>

549
00:45:07,134 --> 00:45:10,183
<i>"I have ordered that
50 hostages be shot."</i>

550
00:45:11,054 --> 00:45:14,137
<i>"Due to the gravity of the crime,
50 more hostages..."</i>

551
00:45:14,974 --> 00:45:17,944
- 15 million for informers!
- More than Judas got.

552
00:45:18,014 --> 00:45:19,937
50 innocent people shot...?

553
00:45:20,014 --> 00:45:21,140
It's true. My father said so.

554
00:45:21,174 --> 00:45:22,141
The occupation:

555
00:45:23,094 --> 00:45:24,095
a quiet war.

556
00:45:24,134 --> 00:45:27,024
It's easy to lay down
the law with guns.

557
00:45:57,174 --> 00:45:59,017
We mustn't see German films.

558
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:01,063
I know. My father told me.

559
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:03,136
It looks terrific though.

560
00:46:03,934 --> 00:46:05,015
And it's in colour.

561
00:46:05,094 --> 00:46:06,141
What a pity.

562
00:46:16,054 --> 00:46:17,101
Prévert wrote it.

563
00:46:17,134 --> 00:46:19,023
A sad love story.

564
00:46:20,054 --> 00:46:21,021
Let's see it.

565
00:46:28,134 --> 00:46:30,136
<i>Three for Les Visifeurs du Soir.</i>

566
00:46:44,094 --> 00:46:46,017
Gluttony is a sin, my boy,

567
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:47,977
but it is your First Communion.

568
00:46:48,054 --> 00:46:50,022
Roast pork...

569
00:46:50,054 --> 00:46:51,977
You've saved our bacon!

570
00:46:52,054 --> 00:46:54,056
If you put it there
it will get cooked.

571
00:46:54,134 --> 00:46:58,025
No, I'm using petrol.
That'll fool them at the checkpoint.

572
00:46:59,054 --> 00:47:00,943
- Thanks.
- See you tomorrow.

573
00:47:01,014 --> 00:47:03,142
I'll come early to help your wife.

574
00:47:05,014 --> 00:47:06,982
<i>Radio Paris lies...</i>

575
00:47:08,054 --> 00:47:10,102
<i>Radio Paris is German!</i>

576
00:47:11,174 --> 00:47:13,984
We'll take the tape off the windows.

577
00:47:37,094 --> 00:47:39,984
We took the floor
and the sugar to the baker's.

578
00:47:40,134 --> 00:47:41,943
It's magnificent.

579
00:47:42,014 --> 00:47:43,982
It's like before the war.

580
00:47:44,054 --> 00:47:45,180
A real tiered cake.

581
00:47:46,054 --> 00:47:47,055
It's been so long.

582
00:47:47,094 --> 00:47:48,294
- I can't eat any more
- I can.

583
00:47:48,974 --> 00:47:51,022
Don't eat, Luce, sing.

584
00:47:52,054 --> 00:47:54,102
Sing us a song!

585
00:47:57,174 --> 00:48:01,179
<i>I laugh to see myself so lovely
in the mirror!</i>

586
00:48:08,054 --> 00:48:10,056
Let's sing another.

587
00:48:10,134 --> 00:48:11,977
<i>"Little Lison".</i>

588
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:15,936
It's going well.

589
00:48:15,974 --> 00:48:19,103
<i>She raises her bottom
like her mother</i>

590
00:48:19,174 --> 00:48:23,065
<i>And with her glass,
she says "Bottoms up!"</i>

591
00:48:29,174 --> 00:48:31,097
You're as handsome as a prince!

592
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:33,097
What present did you get?

593
00:48:33,974 --> 00:48:34,975
A gramophone.

594
00:48:35,094 --> 00:48:36,061
Got any records?

595
00:48:36,094 --> 00:48:37,016
Two.

596
00:48:37,134 --> 00:48:39,023
I can lend you some.

597
00:48:43,174 --> 00:48:45,142
Some water will do them good.

598
00:48:45,974 --> 00:48:47,180
No water!

599
00:48:48,054 --> 00:48:50,944
Water drinkers are nasty,
as was proved by the Flood.

600
00:49:05,134 --> 00:49:07,102
Listen to this, Guy.

601
00:49:07,974 --> 00:49:09,976
Music? Any time.

602
00:49:14,174 --> 00:49:16,984
<i>The clock goes tick-took</i>

603
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:19,102
<i>The birds go cheep-cheep</i>

604
00:49:19,134 --> 00:49:21,136
<i>The turkeys go gobble-gobble</i>

605
00:49:22,014 --> 00:49:24,096
<i>And the bell goes ding-dong...</i>

606
00:49:25,134 --> 00:49:27,057
<i>But when my heart goes boom</i>

607
00:49:27,974 --> 00:49:29,135
<i>Everything else goes boom</i>

608
00:49:29,974 --> 00:49:32,056
<i>As love wakes up.</i>

609
00:49:43,134 --> 00:49:45,023
I like ball bearings.

610
00:49:47,094 --> 00:49:48,141
It's terrific.

611
00:49:49,014 --> 00:49:51,142
You can see all the funnels.
You're lucky.

612
00:49:52,014 --> 00:49:53,982
You can look again if you like.

613
00:49:56,054 --> 00:49:58,102
<i>Is it true you can</i> see <i>Le Normand/e?</i>

614
00:49:58,174 --> 00:49:59,141
Yes.

615
00:50:07,014 --> 00:50:08,140
Let me see.

616
00:50:15,014 --> 00:50:16,140
- I'll swap you.
- For what?

617
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:19,100
Some ball bearings.

618
00:50:21,134 --> 00:50:22,181
Two sets.

619
00:50:23,134 --> 00:50:25,102
Yes. Bye.

620
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:39,182
What you showed
Le Gerrec was film?

621
00:50:39,934 --> 00:50:40,935
Yes, movie film.

622
00:50:41,014 --> 00:50:43,142
- Where'd you find it?
- What'll you give me?

623
00:50:44,134 --> 00:50:46,023
- Ball bearings.
- No.

624
00:50:46,054 --> 00:50:47,055
Two sets.

625
00:50:47,094 --> 00:50:49,142
I want the pencil-sharpener.

626
00:50:49,934 --> 00:50:52,938
Then give me the film
and tell me where you found it.

627
00:50:57,974 --> 00:50:59,976
- <i>It's Le Normand/e?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

628
00:51:14,934 --> 00:51:16,015
Watch out.

629
00:51:16,094 --> 00:51:18,984
Gypsies are dangerous.
You mustn't go near them.

630
00:51:19,014 --> 00:51:21,062
I don't care.
That's not why I came.

631
00:51:53,054 --> 00:51:55,182
Mine's got a plane.
I think it's a Messerschmitt.

632
00:51:55,974 --> 00:51:58,102
- I've got a tank.
- It's German newsreel.

633
00:51:58,134 --> 00:52:01,024
We shouldn't have...
It must be forbidden.

634
00:52:01,094 --> 00:52:03,176
Listen, we found it on a dump!

635
00:52:05,134 --> 00:52:08,024
- We ought to take it back...
- Don't be silly.

636
00:52:09,014 --> 00:52:10,061
<i>These spoils of war,</i>

637
00:52:10,974 --> 00:52:14,103
a <i>few feet of real film,
eagerly brought home by Jacquot,</i>

638
00:52:14,134 --> 00:52:16,136
<i>had no time to become a fetish</i>

639
00:52:16,974 --> 00:52:18,942
<i>and catalyze his passion.</i>

640
00:52:19,014 --> 00:52:21,016
<i>Marilou swept them away as rubbish</i>

641
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,136
<i>or as "compromising documents".</i>

642
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,102
<i>Jacquofhad lost Le Normandie
for nothing.</i>

643
00:52:33,134 --> 00:52:34,135
Hey, Aunt Nique!

644
00:52:34,974 --> 00:52:37,102
Your stocking seam
looks like a snake!

645
00:52:41,014 --> 00:52:43,984
Since I am asked to justify myself,

646
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:47,064
Monsieur Pitou
loves Mademoiselle Clairette

647
00:52:47,174 --> 00:52:49,939
and she loves him too.

648
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,057
<i>Yes, I tell you.</i>

649
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:04,098
<i>It's for her that Monsieur is here.</i>

650
00:53:38,934 --> 00:53:40,060
It's cold.

651
00:53:45,094 --> 00:53:48,143
Those Krauts are ugly.
Jean Marais is handsome.

652
00:53:48,974 --> 00:53:51,022
4:15. What are they waiting for'?

653
00:53:51,054 --> 00:53:52,135
They like making us wait.

654
00:53:52,174 --> 00:53:54,063
They take their time.

655
00:53:54,974 --> 00:53:58,057
Look: "Filming on a farm:
Jean Choux and his crew."

656
00:53:58,094 --> 00:54:00,984
- Ducks too.
- Some crew!

657
00:54:01,174 --> 00:54:04,018
Jean Gourget's new film, Malaria,

658
00:54:04,094 --> 00:54:06,142
will take place
entirely in the tropics.

659
00:54:09,054 --> 00:54:10,021
About time.

660
00:54:10,094 --> 00:54:14,065
"I want Malaria to have
<i>an</i> atmosphere of fear", he says.

661
00:54:14,094 --> 00:54:17,985
"Mireille Balin plays a colonial
wife suffering from malaria."

662
00:54:18,014 --> 00:54:21,939
"Sessue Hayakawa
plays a native boy, a guitar player."

663
00:54:22,014 --> 00:54:25,143
"Love erupts between
these two feverish beings."

664
00:54:29,014 --> 00:54:31,096
- Mireille Balin's beautiful!
- Beautiful?

665
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:33,057
I know what I'm talking about.

666
00:54:33,174 --> 00:54:35,017
That one doesn't look bad.

667
00:54:35,094 --> 00:54:38,143
A guy falling from a tree.
There's blood everywhere!

668
00:54:50,094 --> 00:54:52,096
He's sweet.
He blows up my tires.

669
00:54:53,014 --> 00:54:54,140
Don't forget the valve.

670
00:54:57,974 --> 00:54:59,135
You bike your mother around?

671
00:54:59,174 --> 00:55:03,020
No. She's a neighbour.
She's going for her coupons.

672
00:55:04,174 --> 00:55:06,142
Now you can go.

673
00:55:06,174 --> 00:55:08,939
I'm going out
to get some biscoffes.

674
00:55:10,014 --> 00:55:11,061
I'm scared.

675
00:55:11,094 --> 00:55:12,095
We've got a shelter.

676
00:55:12,174 --> 00:55:14,097
- I want to go.
- We'll all go.

677
00:55:27,094 --> 00:55:29,017
What a racket. It's Hell.

678
00:55:29,094 --> 00:55:30,175
I'm frightened.

679
00:55:30,974 --> 00:55:32,100
I feel sick.

680
00:55:33,094 --> 00:55:35,017
It'll soon be over.

681
00:55:35,054 --> 00:55:37,022
Look how calm Jacquot is.

682
00:55:37,094 --> 00:55:39,938
Remember the cave
where it was as dark as Hell?

683
00:55:44,094 --> 00:55:45,141
I'm frightened.

684
00:55:51,094 --> 00:55:52,983
On September 16th, 1943

685
00:55:53,054 --> 00:55:57,104
I discovered the full horror
of violence and destruction.

686
00:55:58,974 --> 00:56:00,976
There were dead all over town,

687
00:56:01,014 --> 00:56:04,097
people screaming, and dying
beneath the rubble.

688
00:56:05,974 --> 00:56:07,942
It was the Apocalypse.

689
00:56:07,974 --> 00:56:09,021
Ever since

690
00:56:09,134 --> 00:56:10,943
I've hated violence.

691
00:56:45,014 --> 00:56:46,061
My city kids...

692
00:56:48,094 --> 00:56:50,017
I knew we'd see you.

693
00:56:50,174 --> 00:56:52,176
We thought we'd just turn up.

694
00:56:52,974 --> 00:56:55,056
There's no electricity.
It's all broken down.

695
00:56:55,094 --> 00:56:56,141
A total disaster.

696
00:56:56,934 --> 00:56:57,574
It was dreadful.

697
00:56:57,974 --> 00:56:58,975
We heard it here.

698
00:56:59,054 --> 00:57:02,103
Come see the rabbits.
Remember the white one?

699
00:57:02,134 --> 00:57:03,101
Of course.

700
00:57:03,134 --> 00:57:07,059
It was all craters and smoke...
people looking for each other...

701
00:57:07,134 --> 00:57:08,977
I was in the street too.

702
00:57:09,014 --> 00:57:11,984
People were trapped.
I heard them shouting.

703
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:14,022
- On your own?
- I was looking for Papa.

704
00:57:14,054 --> 00:57:17,103
I was fixing a car
on the Avenue des Américains.

705
00:57:17,174 --> 00:57:19,063
I got under it just in time.

706
00:57:19,094 --> 00:57:21,062
The Americans?
You brought them.

707
00:57:21,134 --> 00:57:22,181
Don't be stupid.

708
00:57:22,974 --> 00:57:25,136
It's hard to figure out:
our allies bombing Nantes.

709
00:57:25,174 --> 00:57:27,939
Destroying Nantes, you mean.

710
00:57:28,014 --> 00:57:29,015
Filthy Germans!

711
00:57:29,054 --> 00:57:30,101
It's all their fault.

712
00:57:30,174 --> 00:57:31,175
We're no trouble?

713
00:57:31,974 --> 00:57:34,056
None at all. We'll all squeeze in.

714
00:57:34,134 --> 00:57:35,943
I won't be here long.

715
00:57:36,014 --> 00:57:38,938
I'll go back to the garage
as soon as we get

716
00:57:38,974 --> 00:57:40,135
the electricity back.

717
00:57:41,094 --> 00:57:43,062
He always has his gramophone.

718
00:57:45,014 --> 00:57:46,175
<i>Hello, hello, James.</i>

719
00:57:46,974 --> 00:57:48,021
<i>What's new?</i>

720
00:57:48,094 --> 00:57:50,938
<i>Since my fortnight away?</i>

721
00:57:51,014 --> 00:57:53,984
<i>I'm calling you to discover</i>

722
00:57:54,014 --> 00:57:56,096
<i>What I'll find on my return...</i>

723
00:57:57,094 --> 00:58:00,064
<i>AH is well, Madame la Marquise.</i>

724
00:58:00,134 --> 00:58:02,182
<i>All is very well.</i>

725
00:58:03,054 --> 00:58:05,978
<i>But we must tell you</i>

726
00:58:06,014 --> 00:58:09,018
<i>that there's been
a slight problem...</i>

727
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:31,055
Come on. Inside.

728
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,061
Come to bed, Jacquot.

729
00:58:39,134 --> 00:58:40,181
I'm sleepy.

730
00:58:40,974 --> 00:58:42,055
Go to sleep on your own.

731
00:58:42,134 --> 00:58:44,023
Under the covers, boy.

732
00:58:47,134 --> 00:58:49,136
Are your feet all right now?

733
00:58:49,934 --> 00:58:50,434
Yes.

734
00:58:52,054 --> 00:58:53,977
You'll get used to them.

735
00:59:01,174 --> 00:59:03,176
Finishing your clog today?

736
00:59:11,174 --> 00:59:13,142
No, not that chisel.

737
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:15,101
Here.

738
00:59:29,974 --> 00:59:33,103
I'm teaching you a trade,
but you'll never take it up.

739
00:59:33,134 --> 00:59:35,057
You'll have better to do.

740
00:59:35,134 --> 00:59:36,977
I'm going to make sets.

741
00:59:37,014 --> 00:59:38,015
Sets?

742
00:59:38,134 --> 00:59:40,136
Theatre and cinema sets,

743
00:59:41,014 --> 00:59:42,095
and puppet shows.

744
00:59:47,174 --> 00:59:49,097
Don't walk over the bridge
at Mauves!

745
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:58,016
Missed!

746
01:00:07,014 --> 01:00:08,061
<i>After you,</i>

747
01:00:08,974 --> 01:00:10,942
<i>I'll never</i>

748
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:13,136
<i>love again...</i>

749
01:00:14,934 --> 01:00:16,060
<i>After you,</i>

750
01:00:16,134 --> 01:00:18,944
<i>my heart will be broken</i>

751
01:00:19,014 --> 01:00:21,142
<i>for ever...</i>

752
01:00:51,134 --> 01:00:54,980
Enough reading. Home we go.
We'll swap over.

753
01:01:12,174 --> 01:01:15,144
The past participle agrees with

754
01:01:15,934 --> 01:01:17,936
gender and plural of the complement

755
01:01:18,014 --> 01:01:19,140
when it is placed before.

756
01:01:20,054 --> 01:01:21,135
For example:

757
01:01:21,974 --> 01:01:23,976
<i>la bille qu'il a prise est bleue.</i>

758
01:01:24,054 --> 01:01:26,022
<i>What did he</i> take? <i>La bille.</i>

759
01:01:27,094 --> 01:01:28,141
Listen to me, boys.

760
01:01:29,014 --> 01:01:30,982
Things are getting hot up there.

761
01:01:31,134 --> 01:01:33,182
Bille is feminine
and before the verb

762
01:01:33,974 --> 01:01:36,102
so the colour is feminine too.

763
01:01:38,174 --> 01:01:39,141
Don't be scared.

764
01:01:59,134 --> 01:02:03,139
Every time I hesitate
over a past participle agreeing,

765
01:02:03,174 --> 01:02:06,144
I recall the school classroom
at Mauves

766
01:02:07,934 --> 01:02:09,982
and that parachute

767
01:02:10,014 --> 01:02:12,016
floating down over the Loire.

768
01:02:23,934 --> 01:02:25,015
A late visitor.

769
01:02:25,094 --> 01:02:26,175
Come in.

770
01:02:27,054 --> 01:02:28,180
"Un Visiteur du Soir".

771
01:02:29,134 --> 01:02:31,102
Here's our neighbour.

772
01:02:34,094 --> 01:02:36,096
The Germans raided the café

773
01:02:36,174 --> 01:02:38,984
to get young men for forced labour.

774
01:02:39,014 --> 01:02:41,016
They took Gaston and Paul.

775
01:02:41,094 --> 01:02:43,984
The others
had made themselves scarce.

776
01:02:44,054 --> 01:02:45,101
Damned Germans!

777
01:02:45,174 --> 01:02:46,983
And Gilles too.

778
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:50,137
<i>Giiies and Dominique,
Dominique and Gilles...</i>

779
01:02:50,174 --> 01:02:52,142
No, they didn't take Dominique.

780
01:02:53,094 --> 01:02:55,096
<i>W's item Les Visiteurs du Soir.</i>

781
01:02:55,174 --> 01:02:57,176
Films... That's all he thinks about.

782
01:02:57,974 --> 01:02:59,055
You ought to go see

783
01:02:59,134 --> 01:03:01,978
the old Gallon sisters,
the teachers.

784
01:03:02,014 --> 01:03:05,018
They had a projector
and some Chaplin films.

785
01:03:05,094 --> 01:03:06,061
Some shorts.

786
01:03:06,094 --> 01:03:07,016
Good idea.

787
01:03:07,094 --> 01:03:09,017
The boy's bored stiff.

788
01:03:12,974 --> 01:03:14,135
You'll be careful?

789
01:03:16,014 --> 01:03:17,061
Regularly and gently.

790
01:03:17,094 --> 01:03:19,176
Not too gently, fairly gently.

791
01:03:20,054 --> 01:03:22,022
Here are the films.

792
01:03:26,174 --> 01:03:28,176
You'll bring it back, won't you?

793
01:03:37,174 --> 01:03:39,939
This country lettuce...

794
01:03:40,014 --> 01:03:41,015
It's delicious.

795
01:03:41,054 --> 01:03:43,056
We eat it every day.

796
01:03:44,054 --> 01:03:46,056
- Pleased to see your parents?
- Yes.

797
01:03:48,014 --> 01:03:49,175
Papa gave me a present.

798
01:03:50,054 --> 01:03:51,977
Presents always work.

799
01:04:00,174 --> 01:04:02,142
- What do we do?
- Keep still.

800
01:04:20,174 --> 01:04:21,938
Your bicycle!

801
01:04:22,014 --> 01:04:23,095
Be quiet.

802
01:04:25,974 --> 01:04:28,022
Come in, it's all ready.

803
01:04:28,174 --> 01:04:30,939
Look, Mama, the projector.

804
01:04:31,094 --> 01:04:33,142
Don't touch.
I'm the projectionist.

805
01:04:33,174 --> 01:04:35,142
Look at the screen, Papa.

806
01:04:36,054 --> 01:04:37,943
Sit down.

807
01:04:40,094 --> 01:04:41,141
I've seen it.

808
01:04:46,054 --> 01:04:47,021
It doesn't work.

809
01:04:47,094 --> 01:04:48,983
Be patient. It will.

810
01:04:54,134 --> 01:04:55,135
What is it?

811
01:04:56,054 --> 01:04:58,944
Soap? It's bubble soup!

812
01:05:07,014 --> 01:05:08,937
<i>Jacquot was as delighted</i>

813
01:05:09,014 --> 01:05:11,062
<i>as if he'd made the film himself.</i>

814
01:05:11,134 --> 01:05:13,978
<i>Happily showing films,
he ended his days</i>

815
01:05:14,014 --> 01:05:15,061
<i>at the clog-maker's.</i>

816
01:05:17,974 --> 01:05:19,976
<i>The Loire had become dangerous,</i>

817
01:05:20,054 --> 01:05:21,977
<i>with Americans on one bank,</i>

818
01:05:22,014 --> 01:05:24,016
<i>Germans
and the Resistance on the other.</i>

819
01:05:30,174 --> 01:05:32,017
<i>It was time to go home,</i>

820
01:05:32,174 --> 01:05:34,142
<i>back to the sand,
the long porch,</i>

821
01:05:34,974 --> 01:05:36,180
<i>and the garage courtyard.</i>

822
01:06:09,054 --> 01:06:11,136
<i>When we sing</i>

823
01:06:11,174 --> 01:06:14,018
<i>at cherry blossom time,</i>

824
01:06:14,094 --> 01:06:16,017
<i>the nightingale</i>

825
01:06:16,094 --> 01:06:18,062
<i>and the mockingbirds</i>

826
01:06:18,134 --> 01:06:21,138
<i>all have a wonderful time...</i>

827
01:06:48,134 --> 01:06:50,978
<i>But it doesn't last for ever,</i>

828
01:06:51,054 --> 01:06:52,977
<i>cherry blossom time,</i>

829
01:06:53,014 --> 01:06:56,063
<i>when some people go</i>

830
01:06:56,134 --> 01:07:00,105
<i>to gather earrings in a dream...</i>

831
01:08:03,174 --> 01:08:05,176
The Americans are here!

832
01:08:11,054 --> 01:08:12,101
White wine, Raymond!

833
01:08:39,174 --> 01:08:41,017
Coming?

834
01:08:58,094 --> 01:09:00,062
It's Chopin. I recognise it.

835
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:04,022
I like it here.

836
01:09:05,974 --> 01:09:08,022
Poor Chopin, all jazzed up.

837
01:09:13,974 --> 01:09:15,135
It sounds fine.

838
01:09:15,174 --> 01:09:17,142
But it's written for the piano.

839
01:09:20,054 --> 01:09:22,022
Thanks, I'll take it.

840
01:09:22,054 --> 01:09:23,055
O.K.

841
01:09:24,054 --> 01:09:25,254
I've been through this before,

842
01:09:26,054 --> 01:09:28,978
except the other was lent
and this is a gift.

843
01:09:29,014 --> 01:09:31,016
Don't thank me. It's worthless.

844
01:09:31,094 --> 01:09:33,096
Papa will buy an electric one.

845
01:09:33,134 --> 01:09:35,978
When you're fed up,
you can give it to me.

846
01:09:36,054 --> 01:09:37,101
I'm yourjunk cousin.

847
01:09:37,134 --> 01:09:39,057
Don't be silly!

848
01:09:40,094 --> 01:09:41,175
Bye, old man.

849
01:09:47,974 --> 01:09:50,022
Where am I going
to put all my things?

850
01:09:50,094 --> 01:09:52,176
You need room for a cinema.

851
01:09:52,974 --> 01:09:54,055
You're not fair.

852
01:09:59,134 --> 01:10:02,104
I need cardboard boxes,
glue and fairy lights.

853
01:10:06,014 --> 01:10:07,937
Will you give me money?

854
01:10:28,014 --> 01:10:29,095
This Chaplin is funny.

855
01:10:29,134 --> 01:10:33,025
It's for you. I've seen it
forwards and backwards.

856
01:10:36,054 --> 01:10:38,136
Look at the screen:
pillars just like at the Olympic.

857
01:10:38,974 --> 01:10:41,978
He did it all himself
except for the curtain.

858
01:10:42,014 --> 01:10:43,982
Come have some coffee.

859
01:10:44,014 --> 01:10:45,937
Let him put it away.

860
01:10:46,054 --> 01:10:48,022
I've only got one film.

861
01:10:48,054 --> 01:10:50,944
If only I could rub it out
and change it.

862
01:10:51,014 --> 01:10:52,015
Don't ask me.

863
01:10:52,094 --> 01:10:54,017
You ought to buy me more.

864
01:10:54,054 --> 01:10:55,021
It's not the time.

865
01:10:57,054 --> 01:10:58,101
Will you fix my hairdo?

866
01:10:58,974 --> 01:11:00,021
I don't do hair any more.

867
01:11:00,054 --> 01:11:02,944
What with the boys
and the garage...

868
01:11:03,014 --> 01:11:05,062
I even do the book-keeping, look.

869
01:11:08,054 --> 01:11:10,056
Let's see your hair...

870
01:12:08,014 --> 01:12:09,015
What are you up to?

871
01:12:09,094 --> 01:12:11,176
I've had an idea
how to make a new film.

872
01:12:11,974 --> 01:12:13,942
The saucepan will poison us.

873
01:12:14,014 --> 01:12:16,062
Promise Mama
you'll rinse it well.

874
01:12:24,134 --> 01:12:27,024
- I can't wait to see Part Two.
- Me neither.

875
01:12:27,054 --> 01:12:30,103
I like her saying,
"a glimmer like everyone;"

876
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:33,984
and talking about her mother,
who was a laundress.

877
01:12:34,014 --> 01:12:35,982
It's a fine love story.

878
01:12:38,014 --> 01:12:39,140
It's a masterpiece.

879
01:12:42,094 --> 01:12:44,096
You can't see.
You'll ruin your eyes.

880
01:13:08,054 --> 01:13:09,943
"The bridge at Mauves."

881
01:13:10,134 --> 01:13:12,136
You can see the crossbars.

882
01:13:12,174 --> 01:13:13,983
It was hard to draw.

883
01:13:14,054 --> 01:13:15,135
It's so tiny.

884
01:13:23,934 --> 01:13:26,938
Mama, it's serious.
It's a cartoon newsreel.

885
01:13:26,974 --> 01:13:27,975
It's very good.

886
01:13:28,054 --> 01:13:30,136
"The planes are flying away."

887
01:13:35,014 --> 01:13:36,015
Did you like it?

888
01:13:37,014 --> 01:13:38,140
It was very good.

889
01:13:40,974 --> 01:13:42,180
Look, bras!

890
01:13:43,054 --> 01:13:46,058
- Straight to the ladies' unden/vear!
- Just looking.

891
01:13:46,094 --> 01:13:47,095
Research.

892
01:13:47,134 --> 01:13:49,023
The clean minds of today's youth...

893
01:13:49,094 --> 01:13:51,984
You make your own way home,
Jacquot.

894
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:53,976
Come see.

895
01:13:54,054 --> 01:13:58,059
Women go into that shop
and then they disappear.

896
01:13:58,094 --> 01:13:59,061
Who told you?

897
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:00,181
Someone. I just heard.

898
01:14:02,014 --> 01:14:03,937
- Those two?
- Hard to tell.

899
01:14:04,014 --> 01:14:05,982
- It's a fairy tale.
- No, a drama.

900
01:14:06,014 --> 01:14:10,064
They're sold as slaves
to harems in Argentina.

901
01:14:14,134 --> 01:14:16,023
Look, sheet music.

902
01:14:33,054 --> 01:14:35,022
Aunt Nique has the same.

903
01:14:36,134 --> 01:14:38,057
- What's what?
- Old junk...

904
01:14:38,174 --> 01:14:41,178
- Let's go.
- No. This shop's amazing.

905
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:53,977
Something in particular?

906
01:14:54,054 --> 01:14:55,055
No.

907
01:14:55,174 --> 01:14:59,179
Yes... What's that camera
with the handle in the window?

908
01:14:59,974 --> 01:15:01,135
A movie camera.

909
01:15:01,174 --> 01:15:02,175
For real films?

910
01:15:02,974 --> 01:15:04,135
9.5 mm. For amateurs.

911
01:15:05,054 --> 01:15:06,055
Does it work?

912
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:07,181
If you put film in.

913
01:15:07,974 --> 01:15:10,022
I need it. I want to be an amateur.

914
01:15:10,054 --> 01:15:11,943
But I haven't any money.

915
01:15:12,014 --> 01:15:15,097
Have you nothing to swap?
Books or games?

916
01:15:19,934 --> 01:15:21,936
Why are you rushing about?

917
01:15:22,014 --> 01:15:25,097
- He's got ants in his pants!
- He'll get over it.

918
01:15:25,134 --> 01:15:27,057
All right, Mr Dubuisson?

919
01:15:27,134 --> 01:15:29,102
We fill the tank. We have a chat.

920
01:16:26,094 --> 01:16:28,176
I was looking for you...

921
01:16:29,054 --> 01:16:32,979
I didn't want you to go
knowing you were angry...

922
01:16:40,134 --> 01:16:41,977
<i>So I got the camera,</i>

923
01:16:42,054 --> 01:16:44,978
<i>but I had no idea how to use it.</i>

924
01:16:46,014 --> 01:16:49,063
<i>Luckily,
there was an instruction book.</i>

925
01:16:49,934 --> 01:16:53,063
<i>I was in a hurry to learn
all those barbaric terms</i>

926
01:16:53,134 --> 01:16:56,183
<i>like f-stop, orthochromatic film,</i>

927
01:16:56,974 --> 01:16:58,055
<i>panchromatic vision filter,</i>

928
01:16:58,094 --> 01:16:59,983
<i>film stock...</i>

929
01:17:00,014 --> 01:17:02,142
<i>As soon as I'd read it,
I decided I wanted</i>

930
01:17:02,174 --> 01:17:05,940
<i>to make the script
used as an example:</i>

931
01:17:06,014 --> 01:17:07,095
<i>"Solangds Adventure".</i>

932
01:17:07,174 --> 01:17:08,096
There you are.

933
01:17:08,134 --> 01:17:11,024
I've learned lots of words:
emulsion speed, f-stop,

934
01:17:11,094 --> 01:17:14,143
shutter, ortho, panchro,
depth of field.

935
01:17:14,174 --> 01:17:17,018
Good for you.
But it's all Chinese to me.

936
01:17:17,094 --> 01:17:20,018
What is it?
Is that what you learn at school?

937
01:17:20,934 --> 01:17:22,095
<i>"'" Solange's Adventure'. Actors:</i>

938
01:17:22,174 --> 01:17:24,176
<i>Solange (5),
her parents, a prowler."</i>

939
01:17:25,134 --> 01:17:26,056
Off we go.

940
01:17:26,134 --> 01:17:29,138
<i>"Despite being forbidden to,
Solange plays in the street."</i>

941
01:17:30,134 --> 01:17:33,058
<i>"A prowler promises her sweets
and kidnaps her."</i>

942
01:17:33,134 --> 01:17:35,944
Hey, I'm making a film.

943
01:17:36,014 --> 01:17:37,982
I need a big chap for the gypsy.

944
01:17:38,054 --> 01:17:39,977
Can you come Thursday
to the garage?

945
01:17:40,014 --> 01:17:41,175
On Quai des Tanneurs?

946
01:17:41,974 --> 01:17:42,975
I know. I'll come.

947
01:17:46,174 --> 01:17:48,063
- I'll be home late.
- Don't worry.

948
01:17:48,134 --> 01:17:49,943
It'll be open.

949
01:17:50,014 --> 01:17:52,176
"A gipsy makes her dance at fairs,"

950
01:17:52,974 --> 01:17:55,181
"but her mother recognises her
thanks to a locket."

951
01:17:55,974 --> 01:18:00,184
"This film for all the family
will have more appeal than a reel"

952
01:18:00,974 --> 01:18:04,023
"of some young star
pointlessly posing..."

953
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:07,024
- You learn this at school?
- Yvon asked me that.

954
01:18:07,094 --> 01:18:08,141
That's my fur.

955
01:18:08,174 --> 01:18:10,939
- Will you lend it to me?
- What for?

956
01:18:10,974 --> 01:18:13,136
For Yvon.
He's playing Solange's mother.

957
01:18:13,934 --> 01:18:16,016
René's little brother is Solange.

958
01:18:16,094 --> 01:18:18,176
- What's all this?
- Watch your cocoa!

959
01:18:22,014 --> 01:18:25,097
- I don't like being a girl.
- I wouldn't mind!

960
01:18:25,134 --> 01:18:27,136
We need a dress, make-up,

961
01:18:27,974 --> 01:18:28,941
and a hat.

962
01:18:29,014 --> 01:18:30,982
I'll go to Madame Bredin's.

963
01:18:34,014 --> 01:18:36,016
- I've got it ready.
- Thanks.

964
01:18:38,014 --> 01:18:40,016
It's an old dress of Reine's.

965
01:18:44,134 --> 01:18:46,102
This circus of yours
is causing havoc.

966
01:18:46,174 --> 01:18:47,141
Stop making faces.

967
01:18:50,094 --> 01:18:51,141
You look pretty, Yvon.

968
01:18:52,014 --> 01:18:53,015
Come out.

969
01:18:54,094 --> 01:18:55,983
Yvon, explain to Solange

970
01:18:56,014 --> 01:18:58,016
she mustn't go out alone.

971
01:18:58,054 --> 01:19:00,102
Now, walk slowly toward me.

972
01:19:07,054 --> 01:19:08,180
Good. That'll do.

973
01:19:09,094 --> 01:19:12,018
Here, Lorca,
I'll show you where to go.

974
01:19:12,054 --> 01:19:13,180
You hide here.

975
01:19:13,974 --> 01:19:14,941
René...

976
01:19:15,014 --> 01:19:16,982
We'll do a full-face shot of him.

977
01:19:18,094 --> 01:19:19,983
Solange, you play with your ball.

978
01:19:20,174 --> 01:19:21,096
Drop it...

979
01:19:21,934 --> 01:19:23,015
and turn right.

980
01:19:24,094 --> 01:19:26,096
You're the kidnapper! Look.

981
01:19:26,134 --> 01:19:29,980
"Soon after a
character offers her sweets,"

982
01:19:30,054 --> 01:19:32,022
"then wraps her in his cape."

983
01:19:32,054 --> 01:19:34,056
So you stride after her

984
01:19:35,014 --> 01:19:36,937
and offer her sweets.

985
01:19:37,974 --> 01:19:40,944
- Do you like sweets, pretty girl?
- Yes, sir.

986
01:19:41,014 --> 01:19:42,015
Then you'll get some!

987
01:19:42,094 --> 01:19:43,175
Go on. Fight back!

988
01:20:00,974 --> 01:20:03,102
"Six months later."
Want to be older?

989
01:20:03,134 --> 01:20:04,943
No, it's for my film.

990
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,182
Today, there's good news:

991
01:20:09,134 --> 01:20:11,057
Germany has surrendered.

992
01:20:42,134 --> 01:20:45,104
Belly-dancing means moving
your belly without moving your feet.

993
01:20:45,134 --> 01:20:47,978
You try. Move your head too.

994
01:20:48,054 --> 01:20:50,022
Now we'll do it with the others.

995
01:20:59,014 --> 01:21:00,937
I'll place you with your drum.

996
01:21:00,974 --> 01:21:02,055
You, dance.

997
01:21:02,094 --> 01:21:04,062
You, beat time on the drum.

998
01:21:04,134 --> 01:21:06,057
We'll shoot. Get on with it.

999
01:21:06,134 --> 01:21:08,023
Bang harder, Lorca.

1000
01:21:11,174 --> 01:21:13,097
Then, the mother arrives.

1001
01:21:15,094 --> 01:21:16,095
Now, listen!

1002
01:21:16,134 --> 01:21:18,023
We move back.

1003
01:21:18,054 --> 01:21:19,055
You come forward.

1004
01:21:19,134 --> 01:21:22,024
When you see her dancing,
you say, "Hey!"

1005
01:21:22,054 --> 01:21:24,056
Not now. Move back!

1006
01:21:24,974 --> 01:21:26,055
When we shoot.

1007
01:21:27,014 --> 01:21:28,937
Recognise your daughter.

1008
01:21:29,054 --> 01:21:31,022
But that's Solange's locket!

1009
01:21:32,174 --> 01:21:34,017
Mama!

1010
01:21:43,174 --> 01:21:44,938
What are you doing?

1011
01:21:45,014 --> 01:21:48,063
I'm wrapping up my first takes

1012
01:21:48,094 --> 01:21:51,940
to send them to the Pathé Lab
at Joinville-le-Pont.

1013
01:22:12,014 --> 01:22:12,981
Nothing for me?

1014
01:22:13,054 --> 01:22:16,103
<i>Not today, my boy.</i>

1015
01:22:28,014 --> 01:22:32,019
<i>In the Far West, when night falls</i>

1016
01:22:32,054 --> 01:22:35,024
<i>Cowboys gather round the fire</i>

1017
01:22:36,094 --> 01:22:40,099
<i>And sing an old song</i>

1018
01:22:40,174 --> 01:22:43,940
<i>About beautiful Texas...</i>

1019
01:22:45,974 --> 01:22:47,942
It's going to be a fine cardigan.

1020
01:22:48,014 --> 01:22:50,096
Knitting takes so long. Patience.

1021
01:22:50,134 --> 01:22:53,024
I'm the patient one.
I've been waiting two months.

1022
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:56,104
The labs reopen,
but I still wait and wait.

1023
01:22:56,934 --> 01:22:58,095
It's no joke. I'm fed up.

1024
01:22:59,094 --> 01:23:00,175
And you only knit for Papa!

1025
01:23:37,974 --> 01:23:40,978
<i>Then one fine day
the film arrived.</i>

1026
01:23:41,054 --> 01:23:42,943
<i>What excitement.</i>

1027
01:23:42,974 --> 01:23:46,057
<i>I loaded it on to my projector.
Not a thing.</i>

1028
01:23:46,134 --> 01:23:49,104
<i>It was absolutely,
totally transparent.</i>

1029
01:23:51,014 --> 01:23:53,062
<i>I had forgotten
to adjust the f-stop.</i>

1030
01:23:55,094 --> 01:23:58,143
<i>If was clear
I had to learn the technique.</i>

1031
01:23:58,974 --> 01:23:59,494
What's wrong?

1032
01:23:59,974 --> 01:24:01,942
I want to go to film school.

1033
01:24:04,974 --> 01:24:06,976
We'll ask your father.

1034
01:24:07,054 --> 01:24:08,135
I know what he'll say:

1035
01:24:08,974 --> 01:24:12,023
"Are you crazy?
Thinking about films at your age!"

1036
01:24:16,094 --> 01:24:18,938
Learn a trade in a technical school.

1037
01:24:19,014 --> 01:24:20,937
You'll be a mechanic.

1038
01:24:21,134 --> 01:24:23,136
I want to go to high school.

1039
01:24:24,094 --> 01:24:26,938
Whoopee, veal with prunes!

1040
01:24:30,054 --> 01:24:31,943
I want to graduate.

1041
01:24:32,014 --> 01:24:35,097
Tech gives you a trade.
High school, nothing.

1042
01:24:43,174 --> 01:24:45,142
Set your minds to it for once.

1043
01:24:46,094 --> 01:24:48,062
Go on. Turn it.

1044
01:25:01,014 --> 01:25:02,982
If he picks on me again,
I'm off.

1045
01:25:03,014 --> 01:25:04,140
- Where to?
- Who cares?

1046
01:25:04,974 --> 01:25:07,102
Africa,
to teach mechanics to the Negroes.

1047
01:25:07,134 --> 01:25:10,104
That's it.
You clear off to Timbuktu!

1048
01:25:13,014 --> 01:25:14,140
Me, I'd head for Paris.

1049
01:25:14,934 --> 01:25:17,062
I'll load crates
or be an extra at the Opera.

1050
01:25:17,134 --> 01:25:21,059
They'll take anyone.
One of my mother's clients told me.

1051
01:25:21,134 --> 01:25:24,980
You don't have to sing,
just hammer it out at the back.

1052
01:25:25,094 --> 01:25:27,984
I'll be all right at the Opera then!

1053
01:25:31,014 --> 01:25:34,063
<i>I won't spend my life teaching dance</i>

1054
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:38,059
<i>I'll go to Pan's, take a chance</i>

1055
01:25:38,134 --> 01:25:42,025
<i>Why teach pliés and entrechats</i>

1056
01:25:42,094 --> 01:25:45,064
<i>When I want to dance at the Opera?</i>

1057
01:25:45,174 --> 01:25:47,142
<i>We are a pair of twins</i>

1058
01:25:47,174 --> 01:25:49,142
<i>Born in the sign of Gemini...</i>

1059
01:26:03,134 --> 01:26:05,136
I absolutely must go to Paris.

1060
01:26:05,974 --> 01:26:07,180
I'm going too, but later.

1061
01:26:08,014 --> 01:26:09,982
Papa says I must finish tech.

1062
01:26:10,054 --> 01:26:11,135
Meanwhile, I make films.

1063
01:26:11,974 --> 01:26:12,474
With that?

1064
01:26:12,974 --> 01:26:13,941
As it happens,

1065
01:26:14,094 --> 01:26:18,019
I've had an idea for a film
and you'd be terrific in it.

1066
01:26:18,094 --> 01:26:21,143
Are you kidding?
You and your camera are too small.

1067
01:26:21,174 --> 01:26:23,097
I've got big projects.

1068
01:26:25,054 --> 01:26:26,943
Remember my aunt from Rio,

1069
01:26:27,054 --> 01:26:28,943
how flirtatious she was?

1070
01:26:29,014 --> 01:26:32,143
She batted her eyelashes.
She was fun.

1071
01:26:32,174 --> 01:26:35,178
- It's a great role.
- Wasn't she the casino gambler'?

1072
01:26:36,014 --> 01:26:36,981
Yes, that's her.

1073
01:26:37,054 --> 01:26:39,944
With a scene
where you'd win lots of money.

1074
01:26:40,014 --> 01:26:41,015
Don't you want to?

1075
01:26:42,134 --> 01:26:44,944
Back to your dreams,
young Jacquot.

1076
01:26:45,094 --> 01:26:47,017
I've got my own.

1077
01:26:58,014 --> 01:26:59,061
How's it going?

1078
01:26:59,174 --> 01:27:01,097
I give up on actresses.

1079
01:27:03,974 --> 01:27:06,022
It's better to make cartoons.

1080
01:27:06,094 --> 01:27:08,984
The stars are cardboard
in cardboard sets.

1081
01:27:09,054 --> 01:27:10,943
I see. You want some cardboard?

1082
01:27:10,974 --> 01:27:13,056
- Can I have some?
- Of course you can.

1083
01:27:14,174 --> 01:27:16,063
Thanks, Mr Sweets.

1084
01:27:16,974 --> 01:27:18,976
Am I Mr Sweets for ever'?

1085
01:27:21,134 --> 01:27:23,057
Can I come back for more?

1086
01:27:23,134 --> 01:27:25,057
Whenever you like, boy.

1087
01:27:28,094 --> 01:27:31,098
<i>The boy had a project
and he needed space.</i>

1088
01:27:33,094 --> 01:27:37,179
<i>The attic next to the tires
was ideal and he made it his own.</i>

1089
01:27:40,974 --> 01:27:42,976
<i>A new life of peace and quiet began,</i>

1090
01:27:43,094 --> 01:27:45,062
<i>far from the noise of the tech,</i>

1091
01:27:45,094 --> 01:27:47,938
<i>a triﬂe less from
that of the garage.</i>

1092
01:28:08,054 --> 01:28:09,101
What are you making?

1093
01:28:09,134 --> 01:28:11,057
- A ballerina.
- What's that?

1094
01:28:11,974 --> 01:28:13,100
A girl who dances.

1095
01:28:41,974 --> 01:28:44,022
Look at her with that blonde wig.

1096
01:28:44,054 --> 01:28:44,976
Who?

1097
01:28:45,014 --> 01:28:47,096
Viviane Romance.
She was in Carmen.

1098
01:28:47,174 --> 01:28:49,142
We saw that. It was good.

1099
01:28:49,974 --> 01:28:51,942
- Nice costumes...
- Yes.

1100
01:28:52,014 --> 01:28:54,016
It's a film by Marcel L'Herbier,

1101
01:28:54,054 --> 01:28:55,943
so you know it's good.

1102
01:28:59,134 --> 01:29:00,101
Show me.

1103
01:29:00,174 --> 01:29:02,063
Otherwise I don't get it.

1104
01:29:02,134 --> 01:29:04,136
Come on then, I'll explain.

1105
01:29:05,014 --> 01:29:06,061
Look.

1106
01:29:10,014 --> 01:29:11,175
You have a nice setup.

1107
01:29:12,174 --> 01:29:14,176
Don't touch. It's fragile.

1108
01:29:14,974 --> 01:29:17,944
Not by the camera...
It's exactly in place.

1109
01:29:18,054 --> 01:29:20,022
If I want the little dancer to move,

1110
01:29:21,014 --> 01:29:23,062
I move her leg and shoot a frame.

1111
01:29:28,054 --> 01:29:29,135
Got it?

1112
01:29:30,054 --> 01:29:31,977
It's continuous movement.

1113
01:29:32,014 --> 01:29:34,016
If you film an arm...

1114
01:29:35,134 --> 01:29:37,944
you get continuous movement.

1115
01:29:38,094 --> 01:29:41,985
Now you can climb down.
I need all my concentration.

1116
01:30:02,014 --> 01:30:04,016
It's no damn good!
It's blurred, out of focus.

1117
01:30:04,134 --> 01:30:05,977
No good at all.

1118
01:30:11,974 --> 01:30:12,975
I've got patience.

1119
01:30:13,054 --> 01:30:15,978
If I had a new camera
I'd begin again.

1120
01:30:22,094 --> 01:30:24,062
It's nice being here with you.

1121
01:30:24,134 --> 01:30:26,136
I've been twice and talked to him.

1122
01:30:26,174 --> 01:30:28,097
He says it's a bargain.

1123
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:31,063
It's that one.

1124
01:30:33,134 --> 01:30:35,057
It's more stable. Automatic

1125
01:30:35,134 --> 01:30:37,136
is better than cranking the handle.

1126
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:39,055
If you say so.

1127
01:30:39,134 --> 01:30:40,101
Shall we go in?

1128
01:30:40,974 --> 01:30:41,975
It's your present.

1129
01:30:42,014 --> 01:30:43,937
I'm glad I have you.

1130
01:30:44,094 --> 01:30:45,141
This camera,

1131
01:30:45,174 --> 01:30:48,018
an Ercsam Camex,

1132
01:30:48,934 --> 01:30:50,140
was the one I used.

1133
01:30:53,094 --> 01:30:55,096
It shot frame by frame.

1134
01:31:20,974 --> 01:31:21,975
Car headlamps

1135
01:31:22,054 --> 01:31:24,978
are not the right thing
for lighting sets.

1136
01:31:25,054 --> 01:31:26,977
We're a bit short.

1137
01:31:27,014 --> 01:31:28,140
People are paying late.

1138
01:31:28,934 --> 01:31:31,983
Your chum, Mr Debuisson
owes me <i>2</i> months.

1139
01:31:32,014 --> 01:31:33,140
He's talking to Mama.

1140
01:31:33,974 --> 01:31:35,976
Hello, Mr Debuisson!

1141
01:31:43,134 --> 01:31:44,101
How's the tech?

1142
01:31:44,174 --> 01:31:46,142
My marks are O.K.,
but it's so dull.

1143
01:31:46,174 --> 01:31:47,175
Not again...

1144
01:31:47,974 --> 01:31:51,057
For an artist, it's hard
not getting your own way.

1145
01:31:51,094 --> 01:31:54,064
- You should see the attic.
- You've never seen it!

1146
01:31:54,094 --> 01:31:56,017
I can't stand heights!

1147
01:31:56,054 --> 01:31:58,056
- Can I see?
- Of course.

1148
01:32:14,054 --> 01:32:16,136
The cartoon was terrific.

1149
01:32:16,174 --> 01:32:18,176
That's what I want to do.

1150
01:32:18,974 --> 01:32:20,021
I need equipment.

1151
01:32:20,094 --> 01:32:24,099
Christ on a bike!
Every Sunday the same thing:

1152
01:32:24,134 --> 01:32:27,138
"I don't want to be a mechanic.
I want to study film making."

1153
01:32:27,174 --> 01:32:30,974
We got him a camera.
Now he wants lights, a tripod...

1154
01:32:31,014 --> 01:32:32,140
God knows what else!

1155
01:32:32,974 --> 01:32:35,136
- Calm down, Raymond.
- I wish he would!

1156
01:32:47,174 --> 01:32:50,018
You're tough on Jacquot.
He works hard.

1157
01:32:50,094 --> 01:32:52,017
Let him have fun.

1158
01:32:53,174 --> 01:32:57,020
<i>A foreign girl arrived in Paris</i>

1159
01:32:57,094 --> 01:33:00,143
<i>Having crossed the globe</i>

1160
01:33:00,174 --> 01:33:04,020
<i>She settled in our fine country</i>

1161
01:33:04,094 --> 01:33:07,098
<i>But she had left
something behind in Chile</i>

1162
01:33:07,934 --> 01:33:11,097
<i>She had left something behind...</i>

1163
01:33:12,974 --> 01:33:16,057
And I forgot to buy
a Madeira cake.

1164
01:33:16,134 --> 01:33:18,182
I'm not a baby.
Cake won't work.

1165
01:33:18,974 --> 01:33:21,944
Sweet things never hurt grouches.

1166
01:33:22,014 --> 01:33:24,984
You've been sitting there
for an hour fuming with rage.

1167
01:33:25,014 --> 01:33:26,294
You know why?
Papa drives me mad.

1168
01:33:27,134 --> 01:33:31,981
Don't say that. It's a sin.
So is sulking.

1169
01:33:32,014 --> 01:33:33,982
Laugh, you clown.

1170
01:33:34,014 --> 01:33:36,096
Even if you're sad!

1171
01:33:36,974 --> 01:33:40,137
Ask your Papa to tell you what
happened when he came to Nantes

1172
01:33:40,174 --> 01:33:42,142
from the country...

1173
01:33:43,094 --> 01:33:44,175
His "room in town"

1174
01:33:44,974 --> 01:33:47,056
in a drunk's house,
a Colonel's widow.

1175
01:33:50,014 --> 01:33:52,016
<i>Thank you, Guilbaud.</i>

1176
01:33:52,054 --> 01:33:55,979
<i>Have a drink with me.</i>

1177
01:33:56,054 --> 01:34:00,059
<i>I'm sure it'll cheer you up.</i>

1178
01:34:00,134 --> 01:34:02,057
<i>You've drunk enough tonight.</i>

1179
01:34:02,134 --> 01:34:05,138
<i>No? Too bad for you.</i>

1180
01:34:05,934 --> 01:34:08,141
<i>You're already drunk as a skunk.</i>

1181
01:34:08,974 --> 01:34:11,978
<i>The way you speak amuses me.</i>

1182
01:34:12,014 --> 01:34:14,016
<i>As drunk as a skunk, indeed!</i>

1183
01:34:14,974 --> 01:34:19,024
<i>I'll just drink to your health.</i>

1184
01:34:23,134 --> 01:34:25,057
And now the show begins...

1185
01:34:26,014 --> 01:34:27,061
Turn it on, Yvon.

1186
01:34:30,094 --> 01:34:33,093
His father agreed
to cut the door in half.

1187
01:34:33,094 --> 01:34:34,095
Why?

1188
01:34:34,974 --> 01:34:35,614
Projector noise.

1189
01:34:35,974 --> 01:34:37,976
The smallest cinema in the world.

1190
01:34:38,014 --> 01:34:39,175
I'm flattered to be invited.

1191
01:34:39,974 --> 01:34:41,214
You're our son's main supplier.

1192
01:34:41,974 --> 01:34:43,976
My supplier and friend.

1193
01:34:44,014 --> 01:34:46,938
Turn the light off, Yvon.
Open the curtains.

1194
01:34:48,974 --> 01:34:49,941
Screen!

1195
01:34:50,134 --> 01:34:51,181
Music!

1196
01:35:25,054 --> 01:35:26,021
Lights, Yvon.

1197
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:29,982
Short, but very sweet!

1198
01:35:33,094 --> 01:35:34,983
Sailors are fun.

1199
01:35:37,934 --> 01:35:39,174
Mountain-climbing's great.

1200
01:35:39,974 --> 01:35:41,055
The mountain can wait.

1201
01:35:41,974 --> 01:35:44,022
<i>You must see Beauty and the Beast.</i>

1202
01:35:44,094 --> 01:35:45,095
- Think so?
- You bet.

1203
01:35:45,174 --> 01:35:47,984
If you do, I'll go again with you.

1204
01:35:49,094 --> 01:35:53,019
You accept me if I draw,
but you never let me in your attic.

1205
01:35:53,934 --> 01:35:55,015
That's normal.

1206
01:35:55,174 --> 01:35:57,142
Demy, come tell us what to see.

1207
01:35:57,934 --> 01:35:59,060
He always knows.

1208
01:36:01,974 --> 01:36:03,100
We must see...

1209
01:36:03,134 --> 01:36:06,104
Duvivier's <i>Unfel</i> Pére ef <i>Fils.</i>
It's good.

1210
01:36:07,054 --> 01:36:09,944
I've seen <i>Caprice</i>
with Daniéle Darrieux.

1211
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:11,982
We know what you think of her.

1212
01:36:12,014 --> 01:36:13,061
Let's see.

1213
01:36:16,014 --> 01:36:17,015
Edith Piaf.

1214
01:36:17,094 --> 01:36:18,095
I adore her.

1215
01:36:18,174 --> 01:36:20,097
She sings really well.

1216
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:22,176
I'm making a film in my attic.

1217
01:36:22,974 --> 01:36:26,183
A bag snatcher escaping
over the roofs of Paris.

1218
01:36:26,974 --> 01:36:30,057
It's called "Attaque Nocturne".
I'll be tied up for months.

1219
01:36:42,974 --> 01:36:44,100
<i>Four seasons had passed,</i>

1220
01:36:44,174 --> 01:36:46,017
<i>or a number, anyway...</i>

1221
01:36:46,054 --> 01:36:47,977
<i>Between fitting and welding,</i>

1222
01:36:48,054 --> 01:36:51,103
<i>Jacquofs French teacher
introduced him to classical music.</i>

1223
01:36:51,134 --> 01:36:53,978
<i>He bought a copy of this record,</i>

1224
01:36:54,054 --> 01:36:55,977
<i>but remained faithful to the Waltzes</i>

1225
01:36:56,134 --> 01:36:58,136
<i>which suited "Attaque Nocturne".</i>

1226
01:37:13,174 --> 01:37:15,017
<i>Jacquot had grown.</i>

1227
01:37:15,094 --> 01:37:16,983
<i>He had changed.</i>

1228
01:37:20,094 --> 01:37:22,938
<i>When he came down for meals,</i>

1229
01:37:23,014 --> 01:37:25,938
<i>he didn't say much,
which worried his mother.</i>

1230
01:37:30,014 --> 01:37:32,062
All right, Yvon, Jacquot's here.

1231
01:37:33,134 --> 01:37:37,105
<i>When his father
came up for a new tire,</i>

1232
01:37:37,974 --> 01:37:40,978
<i>he never looked at
the cardboard city his son lived in.</i>

1233
01:37:41,014 --> 01:37:43,096
<i>Yvon had become a sportsman.</i>

1234
01:37:44,054 --> 01:37:46,022
<i>Jacquot visited his grandmother</i>

1235
01:37:46,094 --> 01:37:48,142
<i>and went to the cinema a lot...</i>

1236
01:37:48,174 --> 01:37:50,984
<i>or walked towards the port.</i>

1237
01:37:51,014 --> 01:37:53,016
<i>He was pulling at his moorings.</i>

1238
01:37:53,094 --> 01:37:55,176
<i>Jacquot was becoming Jacques.</i>

1239
01:37:57,054 --> 01:37:59,102
<i>He still complained about the tech.</i>

1240
01:38:01,094 --> 01:38:03,984
I hated that technical school.

1241
01:38:04,934 --> 01:38:07,938
Thumping my sheet metal
felt like hitting my father,

1242
01:38:07,974 --> 01:38:09,942
or letting off steam.

1243
01:38:10,094 --> 01:38:13,985
I had to get out of there,
find a solution.

1244
01:38:15,014 --> 01:38:18,097
While I made a mortise and tenon,

1245
01:38:19,014 --> 01:38:21,984
I was thinking of Hollywood.

1246
01:38:33,014 --> 01:38:35,176
Where's this going?
Round the client's neck?

1247
01:38:35,974 --> 01:38:37,055
Start again.

1248
01:38:37,174 --> 01:38:40,064
Fitting a tire
without the inner tube!

1249
01:38:40,134 --> 01:38:41,977
Hang on, I'll give you a hand.

1250
01:38:42,054 --> 01:38:44,056
It's not a champagne omelette.

1251
01:38:44,094 --> 01:38:45,141
What were you thinking of?

1252
01:38:45,974 --> 01:38:47,055
Hollywood, of course!

1253
01:38:47,094 --> 01:38:48,983
Some mechanic...

1254
01:38:52,974 --> 01:38:54,942
Rita has a terrific figure.

1255
01:38:55,014 --> 01:38:56,015
She was a G.l. mascot.

1256
01:38:56,094 --> 01:38:57,175
They had her everywhere,

1257
01:38:57,974 --> 01:38:59,942
even on that awful Hiroshima bomb.

1258
01:39:00,134 --> 01:39:04,025
- You believe that?
- Yes, Rita was the bombshell.

1259
01:39:07,054 --> 01:39:08,135
We'll screen this film.

1260
01:39:08,934 --> 01:39:10,060
You'll see.

1261
01:39:10,934 --> 01:39:13,141
It's ages since I saw it,
it may be no good.

1262
01:39:13,974 --> 01:39:15,976
Let's take a look all the same.

1263
01:39:17,014 --> 01:39:19,062
- Can I switch it on?
- Wait...

1264
01:39:49,974 --> 01:39:52,136
This way, please.

1265
01:39:56,014 --> 01:39:58,062
I like the title:
"Le Port de I'Angoisse".

1266
01:39:58,094 --> 01:39:59,937
That's the French title.

1267
01:40:00,014 --> 01:40:04,019
Remember the scene where
Bogart picks his passengers up.

1268
01:40:04,094 --> 01:40:06,142
Yes, that's "day for night".

1269
01:40:06,174 --> 01:40:08,063
It was shot in daylight.

1270
01:40:08,134 --> 01:40:10,978
- And the moonlight?
- There isn't any.

1271
01:40:11,014 --> 01:40:14,063
It's the sun's reflection
through a red filter.

1272
01:40:14,134 --> 01:40:15,943
To shoot moonlight,

1273
01:40:15,974 --> 01:40:18,056
you need sunshine as backlighting

1274
01:40:18,134 --> 01:40:22,025
with, say, a reflection on water,
a shiny surface of some kind.

1275
01:40:22,094 --> 01:40:24,984
You need to have a precise angle

1276
01:40:25,054 --> 01:40:26,101
between the camera,

1277
01:40:26,134 --> 01:40:28,023
the backlit characters

1278
01:40:28,094 --> 01:40:29,175
and the sun.

1279
01:40:29,934 --> 01:40:30,935
How do you know?

1280
01:40:31,014 --> 01:40:31,981
I learnt it.

1281
01:40:52,974 --> 01:40:55,136
That dress is too tight.

1282
01:40:55,974 --> 01:40:57,055
At least they can see!

1283
01:40:57,134 --> 01:41:00,183
It's nothing to be proud of.
What do I say to people?

1284
01:41:00,934 --> 01:41:03,983
Who to? Friends, neighbours?
It's none of their business.

1285
01:41:04,054 --> 01:41:05,135
You never tell me anything.

1286
01:41:05,174 --> 01:41:07,939
Make it up.
Say I'm getting married.

1287
01:41:08,014 --> 01:41:11,018
- A good idea.
- Then I'll go find me a husband.

1288
01:41:21,054 --> 01:41:22,977
- What a business.
- As you can see.

1289
01:41:23,174 --> 01:41:24,983
What are you going to do?

1290
01:41:25,054 --> 01:41:28,024
Me, nothing,
but my mother wants me married.

1291
01:41:28,134 --> 01:41:29,101
Who With?

1292
01:41:29,174 --> 01:41:30,141
I don't know.

1293
01:41:30,974 --> 01:41:32,976
I don't know anyone who wants to

1294
01:41:33,054 --> 01:41:34,977
and you're far too young.

1295
01:41:39,174 --> 01:41:40,141
Coming out?

1296
01:41:41,974 --> 01:41:44,136
I hate carnivals.
I'm going back upstairs.

1297
01:41:45,094 --> 01:41:46,061
Are you going?

1298
01:41:46,094 --> 01:41:48,938
I'm going with my chums
to see Mr Obligi.

1299
01:41:48,974 --> 01:41:50,100
He films for the news.

1300
01:41:50,134 --> 01:41:53,058
- You say that, then go dancing.
- No, I don't.

1301
01:41:55,174 --> 01:41:58,018
Come back
for my baby's christening!

1302
01:41:58,094 --> 01:42:00,062
I'll just take a look...

1303
01:42:15,974 --> 01:42:17,055
What's your name?

1304
01:42:17,134 --> 01:42:18,943
Josiane

1305
01:42:32,054 --> 01:42:34,136
<i>How silly these people are!</i>

1306
01:42:34,174 --> 01:42:36,142
<i>I hate carnival time.</i>

1307
01:42:36,974 --> 01:42:39,102
<i>Don't be so bitter, darling.</i>

1308
01:42:41,014 --> 01:42:43,176
<i>Look how big you are.</i>

1309
01:42:43,974 --> 01:42:47,979
<i>You carry it in front.
It'll be a boy, or twins.</i>

1310
01:42:48,014 --> 01:42:50,062
<i>No, everything's fine.</i>

1311
01:42:55,974 --> 01:42:57,055
I'm sick of operetta.

1312
01:42:57,974 --> 01:43:01,137
You see it all from one place.
At the movies, your eye moves.

1313
01:43:01,174 --> 01:43:04,974
You can see faces and details.
It's better.

1314
01:43:18,094 --> 01:43:19,141
Papa!

1315
01:43:19,934 --> 01:43:20,935
Papa. Quick!

1316
01:43:21,014 --> 01:43:22,095
My drawing teacher...

1317
01:43:22,174 --> 01:43:23,175
Hang on.

1318
01:43:23,974 --> 01:43:25,100
I told you, remember?

1319
01:43:25,134 --> 01:43:26,181
The one who likes me.

1320
01:43:27,974 --> 01:43:29,942
Let me finish.

1321
01:43:30,014 --> 01:43:31,982
I asked him to drop by.

1322
01:43:33,054 --> 01:43:34,055
He's with Mama.

1323
01:43:34,094 --> 01:43:35,095
Come talk to him.

1324
01:43:36,134 --> 01:43:40,025
It's not very reasonable
to think about the cinema.

1325
01:43:40,054 --> 01:43:42,136
He tinkers in the attic.
I've seen bits.

1326
01:43:42,174 --> 01:43:43,141
He's gifted.

1327
01:43:43,174 --> 01:43:46,940
No doubt,
but the cinema is another world.

1328
01:43:46,974 --> 01:43:48,095
Many are called, few chosen.

1329
01:43:48,974 --> 01:43:51,944
I advise you to rid him
of his illusions.

1330
01:44:04,174 --> 01:44:06,939
- Has he gone?
- He was in a hurry.

1331
01:44:06,974 --> 01:44:07,975
Coffee, Raymond?

1332
01:44:08,094 --> 01:44:10,938
- Didn't he say anything?
- Not really.

1333
01:44:11,014 --> 01:44:13,142
Do you want coffee, or cocoa?

1334
01:44:13,174 --> 01:44:15,097
Why did he come then?

1335
01:44:15,134 --> 01:44:16,135
Come inside.

1336
01:44:47,974 --> 01:44:49,942
<i>There's no love, Héléne.</i>

1337
01:44:50,014 --> 01:44:52,016
<i>Only proof of love.</i>

1338
01:45:07,054 --> 01:45:09,102
<i>If life's mysteries</i>

1339
01:45:09,134 --> 01:45:11,057
<i>add up to nothing</i>

1340
01:45:11,174 --> 01:45:15,020
<i>Don't think, don't think
about it too much.</i>

1341
01:45:15,094 --> 01:45:19,144
<i>Why does the rain come from above?</i>

1342
01:45:20,014 --> 01:45:22,938
<i>Don't think, don't think
about it too much.</i>

1343
01:45:22,974 --> 01:45:27,059
<i>Why does the moon
have an influence</i>

1344
01:45:27,134 --> 01:45:32,015
<i>On the tides of the Seven Seas?</i>

1345
01:45:32,054 --> 01:45:36,139
<i>Why do peacocks go "Lee-co"
while cocks "Cockle-doo-doo"?</i>

1346
01:45:36,934 --> 01:45:39,983
<i>Don't think, don't think
about it too much.</i>

1347
01:45:42,974 --> 01:45:44,055
Everything O.K.?

1348
01:45:44,094 --> 01:45:47,018
- Yes, fine.
- What's this setup?

1349
01:45:47,974 --> 01:45:49,135
Roller-skating on the set?

1350
01:45:49,174 --> 01:45:52,064
To do voluptuous crane shots,

1351
01:45:52,134 --> 01:45:56,139
I had fixed the camera
on a roller skate.

1352
01:45:56,174 --> 01:45:58,939
I had a sort of sloping incline,

1353
01:45:59,014 --> 01:46:02,097
all marked out in millimetres
and centimetres.

1354
01:46:02,174 --> 01:46:04,984
I moved it down,

1355
01:46:05,014 --> 01:46:07,016
shot a frame,

1356
01:46:07,094 --> 01:46:08,983
moved it lower

1357
01:46:09,054 --> 01:46:10,101
and shot another.

1358
01:46:10,134 --> 01:46:12,102
Then I had to move my little man.

1359
01:46:12,174 --> 01:46:15,018
You make him come down the steps

1360
01:46:15,094 --> 01:46:18,018
and I'll move the camera down,
frame by frame.

1361
01:46:18,094 --> 01:46:20,938
We're trying it out speeded up.

1362
01:46:21,014 --> 01:46:23,096
I should finish up in close-up

1363
01:46:23,134 --> 01:46:25,136
on the thief
hiding down the manhole.

1364
01:46:27,054 --> 01:46:28,135
It ought to work,

1365
01:46:29,014 --> 01:46:30,061
except when it comes to it...

1366
01:46:30,134 --> 01:46:34,025
It required great patience,
but I had always had that.

1367
01:46:39,054 --> 01:46:40,180
Coming...

1368
01:46:45,054 --> 01:46:47,022
You're always the first.

1369
01:46:51,134 --> 01:46:54,104
- We don't see each other much.
- I don't have time.

1370
01:46:54,174 --> 01:46:56,984
You have to finish your film...

1371
01:46:57,054 --> 01:47:00,137
It's slowed up
since we've been going out.

1372
01:47:06,054 --> 01:47:08,136
You do look like
Frangoise Christophe.

1373
01:47:08,174 --> 01:47:09,983
I think you're very pretty.

1374
01:47:51,134 --> 01:47:52,181
It's good.

1375
01:48:17,134 --> 01:48:19,102
Last night was fun.

1376
01:48:19,174 --> 01:48:21,142
At last you're happy.

1377
01:48:21,174 --> 01:48:22,983
You're learning a trade.

1378
01:48:23,094 --> 01:48:25,017
You're doing well at tech.

1379
01:48:25,974 --> 01:48:27,976
You do your film. You're calm.

1380
01:48:28,054 --> 01:48:29,055
Everything's fine.

1381
01:48:29,974 --> 01:48:31,135
I'm calm but I'm not happy.

1382
01:48:31,974 --> 01:48:34,102
You understand nothing!
I've no choice.

1383
01:48:34,134 --> 01:48:36,023
Look how calm I am!

1384
01:48:44,974 --> 01:48:45,975
Manual workers

1385
01:48:46,054 --> 01:48:48,102
only receive a primary education,

1386
01:48:48,134 --> 01:48:51,104
but know all about their trade.

1387
01:48:52,054 --> 01:48:56,139
Manual workers are generally strong
with well-developed bodies.

1388
01:48:56,974 --> 01:49:00,183
Secondly, intellectual workers,
bureaucrats for example,

1389
01:49:00,934 --> 01:49:02,140
need exercise after work.

1390
01:49:02,974 --> 01:49:06,183
Intellectuals are not as strong
as manual workers.

1391
01:49:09,014 --> 01:49:10,175
To conclude,

1392
01:49:11,014 --> 01:49:14,018
the manual worker
and the intellectual worker

1393
01:49:14,094 --> 01:49:17,177
are totally different
from each other.

1394
01:49:18,014 --> 01:49:19,015
Write it down.

1395
01:49:19,054 --> 01:49:20,977
<i>MAN'S PRIDE IS WORK WELL DONE</i>

1396
01:49:22,014 --> 01:49:24,062
I feel as flat as my little men.

1397
01:49:25,014 --> 01:49:27,142
Now I've done my film,
I'm at a loose end.

1398
01:49:27,174 --> 01:49:30,178
I was happy making it,
sure of myself.

1399
01:49:30,974 --> 01:49:32,135
Now, there's only the tech,

1400
01:49:32,934 --> 01:49:34,936
the final exam in <i>2</i> or 3 months

1401
01:49:35,014 --> 01:49:36,140
and then...

1402
01:49:36,174 --> 01:49:39,098
I'm not even angry any more.
That's what's scary.

1403
01:49:40,174 --> 01:49:42,063
You're tired. It'll pass.

1404
01:49:42,134 --> 01:49:44,102
What I've seen of your film is ace.

1405
01:49:44,134 --> 01:49:47,104
That's what you say.
Only you come up here.

1406
01:49:47,974 --> 01:49:49,135
Your "Bag Snatcher" is good.

1407
01:49:49,974 --> 01:49:51,100
It's not "Bag Snatcher".

1408
01:49:51,174 --> 01:49:53,063
It's "Nocturnal Attack".

1409
01:49:55,014 --> 01:49:57,016
I said I had to make films

1410
01:49:57,054 --> 01:50:00,058
as I was sick
to death of the garage.

1411
01:50:00,134 --> 01:50:05,015
He kindly told me I should go see
Fernand Jean at the Apollo,

1412
01:50:06,054 --> 01:50:07,135
to find out what he thought.

1413
01:50:07,174 --> 01:50:08,938
Remain confident.

1414
01:50:09,094 --> 01:50:11,096
I'll talk to Fernand Jean.

1415
01:50:13,134 --> 01:50:15,136
So I went to the Apollo cinema

1416
01:50:15,174 --> 01:50:17,176
with my projector

1417
01:50:18,094 --> 01:50:19,175
and showed the film

1418
01:50:19,934 --> 01:50:21,982
from the Apollo's projection room

1419
01:50:22,014 --> 01:50:23,140
to the manager who said,

1420
01:50:23,974 --> 01:50:26,181
"it's good.
You ought to be making films."

1421
01:50:26,974 --> 01:50:29,978
I told him
my parents didn't agree...

1422
01:50:30,054 --> 01:50:32,978
Later, Christian-Jaque
came to Nantes

1423
01:50:33,014 --> 01:50:35,984
<i>to present his</i> film
<i>Dfiomme a': hommes.</i>

1424
01:50:36,054 --> 01:50:38,056
Where are you taking us?

1425
01:50:38,094 --> 01:50:41,064
To see Dfiomme a': hommes.
You'll like it.

1426
01:50:41,134 --> 01:50:42,135
What's it about?

1427
01:50:42,174 --> 01:50:44,984
The chap who founded the Red Cross

1428
01:50:45,014 --> 01:50:47,016
and Christian-Jaque will be there.

1429
01:50:47,094 --> 01:50:49,142
- We've seen several of his.
- He's made 40!

1430
01:50:49,174 --> 01:50:50,938
All right. Let's go.

1431
01:50:50,974 --> 01:50:52,100
I'm going on my bike.

1432
01:50:53,054 --> 01:50:54,135
At the intermission,

1433
01:50:54,934 --> 01:50:58,063
Christian-Jaque was kind enough
to look at my film.

1434
01:50:58,134 --> 01:51:00,978
He saw it and thought it wasn't bad.

1435
01:51:01,054 --> 01:51:02,977
"You ought to make films", he said.

1436
01:51:03,054 --> 01:51:05,022
And my father then said,

1437
01:51:05,094 --> 01:51:08,143
"Well, if you think the boy
can do any good,"

1438
01:51:08,174 --> 01:51:10,176
"then he'll go to Paris."

1439
01:51:10,974 --> 01:51:12,100
I left for Paris

1440
01:51:12,134 --> 01:51:14,102
the following October.

1441
01:51:45,094 --> 01:51:47,176
First, I studied film-making

1442
01:51:48,174 --> 01:51:51,974
and I was out of work,
then a filmmaker.

1443
01:51:52,014 --> 01:51:54,096
I met a woman filmmaker,

1444
01:51:54,174 --> 01:51:56,939
we made a few films,

1445
01:51:56,974 --> 01:51:59,022
then she gave me a fine son

1446
01:51:59,054 --> 01:52:00,943
and now I paint.

1447
01:52:27,094 --> 01:52:29,984
<i>Devils and wonders,</i>

1448
01:52:30,014 --> 01:52:32,096
<i>winds and tides,</i>

1449
01:52:32,174 --> 01:52:33,983
<i>far away</i>

1450
01:52:34,054 --> 01:52:37,024
<i>the sea has gone out.</i>

1451
01:52:38,014 --> 01:52:40,142
<i>And you, like a strand of seaweed</i>

1452
01:52:40,174 --> 01:52:43,974
<i>gently caressed by the wind,</i>

1453
01:52:44,014 --> 01:52:45,982
<i>you move as you dream</i>

1454
01:52:46,054 --> 01:52:48,102
<i>in the sands of the bed.</i>

1455
01:52:49,054 --> 01:52:51,182
<i>Devils and wonders,
winds and tides,</i>

1456
01:52:52,974 --> 01:52:56,103
<i>far away the sea has gone out.</i>

1457
01:52:57,054 --> 01:52:59,978
<i>But in your half-open eyes</i>

1458
01:53:00,054 --> 01:53:02,978
<i>two tiny waves are still there.</i>

1459
01:53:04,014 --> 01:53:07,018
<i>Devils and wonders,
winds and tides,</i>

1460
01:53:07,174 --> 01:53:09,939
<i>two tiny tears,</i>

1461
01:53:10,014 --> 01:53:12,062
<i>two tiny waves</i>

1462
01:53:12,094 --> 01:53:14,142
<i>to drown myself in.</i>
