2
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,780
I know the art
of evoking happy moments.

3
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,780
Scents, unending kisses...

4
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,780
Will they be born again
from that unfathomable abyss,

5
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,380
like a rejuvenated sun
rises in the heaven

6
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,060
from the depths of the sea?

7
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,600
O scents, O unending kisses!

8
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,620
The night was growing dense
like a wall.

9
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,700
My eyes met yours
in the darkness.

10
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,700
And I drank your breath.
O sweetness, O poison!

11
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,820
And your feet fell asleep
in my brotherly hands.

12
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,440
The night was growing dense
like a wall.

13
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,780
- Is it over?
- It's not!

14
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,700
- Come, Jacquot, it's the end.
- Sometimes it starts again.

15
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,740
No, it doesn't. Let's go.
Dad's waiting...

16
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,960
It's not finished...
I'm staying put.

17
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,680
DEMY'S CINEMA

18
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,760
Show us yours, Jacquot.

19
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,660
- What?
- Don't worry...

20
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,740
They do this in the army,

21
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,900
to measure and compare,
so they know.

22
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,940
Know what?

23
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,980
Someone's coming!

24
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,160
Put it back in,
it's nothing to brag about.

25
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,680
You three again!

26
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,820
Have you done your homework?

27
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,900
Yes, is it done?

28
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,740
- Not yet, Dad.
- Do what your father says.

29
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,360
Hurry up, Mrs. Marilou!

30
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,820
Five liters exactly.

31
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,280
Swell.

32
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,900
- Hurry! Only one side curled...
- I'm coming!

33
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,080
I'm on stage in an hour.

34
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,640
- That's in Act 2.
- Yes, it's the donkey duet.

35
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,680
The curler is too hot.

36
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,900
Come down.
Stay away from that ladder.

37
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,820
Done your homework?

38
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,880
I left my bag in the garage.

39
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,760
- It's OK now?
- Yes.

40
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,920
It clunks when it's cold,
which is normal.

41
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,880
Demy Garage here.

42
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,900
I wanna order a new car.

43
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,760
A black Citroën 7 CV.

44
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,840
The customer can't wait.

45
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,940
Damn kids!

46
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,880
Always in the stairs...

47
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,980
Jacquot! I hate being late.

48
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,760
I wanted an orange.

49
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,840
Good night, Dad.

50
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,860
You should've come too.

51
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,920
I know "Les Saltimbanques."

52
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,900
The woman Mom curls...

53
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,980
It is love
That consoles the poor...

54
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,760
In bed, "the poor."

55
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840
Say your prayers.

56
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,400
Our Father, who art in Heaven...

57
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,780
They're good boys.

58
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,320
Hail Mary, full of grace...

59
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,200
Coming to give us a kiss, Mom?

60
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,700
A rich laborer,
knowing death was imminent,

61
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,680
called his children in...

62
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,900
...and addressed them
without witness.

63
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,140
Be sure not to sell
what is ours, he said.

64
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,320
There is a treasure
hidden within.

65
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,900
Jacques's childhood
was his treasure

66
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,060
and a source of inspiration
for his films.

67
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,780
Now...

68
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,440
Let me write.

69
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,740
He loved to write about
his childhood memories.

70
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,700
Anecdotes flooded back,
forgotten names

71
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,760
and suddenly remembered details.

72
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,940
He spoke of the little kitchen,

73
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,840
the focus of family life.

74
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,780
And above all of his mother,

75
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,840
who was the life and soul of it.

76
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,640
Do you remember our last date?

77
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,620
He liked remembering
Sunday outings,

78
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,860
when time passed slowly.

79
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,880
He had experienced what
he called "a happy childhood."

80
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,940
Jacques recalled
the arrival of a country cousin

81
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,800
that a Brazilian industrialist
had turned into an upscale tart.

82
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,800
Wait here.

83
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,300
Hey, cutie,
is this Raymond's garage?

84
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,740
Raymond's my father.
What is it?

85
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,520
You don't know me,
but I'm your aunt from Rio.

86
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,860
Someone to see you, boss.

87
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,780
- There he is.
- It's you!

88
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,160
You look great.

89
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,840
Come and meet the wife.

90
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,360
The cousin I told you about
who headed to Brazil.

91
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,740
- Don't touch, it's organza.
- Now I know the whole family.

92
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,860
I'll take you all
to La Cigale tonight.

93
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,700
Come here, you.

94
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,700
You're invited too.

95
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,600
Now we can kiss.

96
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,160
Oops! It's my lipstick.

97
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,740
Shall I sing you a song?

98
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,360
- For God's sake, don't get up.
- Go on, Dad. Sing!

99
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,740
Didn't you miss our local wine?

100
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,980
Yes, I often think of
"Gros Plant."

101
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,560
One day a producer said
I ought to be in the movies.

102
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,860
So I did tests.

103
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,080
But "Gros Plan"
means "Close-up"!

104
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,860
I thought he was
offering white wine!

105
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,640
Let's drink to that!

106
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,840
Cheers!

107
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,860
- Amazing diamonds.
- You shouldn't have.

108
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,660
I've been spoiled too.
You really shouldn't have...

109
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,900
Now don't you criticize me!

110
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,740
No, I'm pleased with my gift.

111
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,860
I adore casinos,
particularly roulette...

112
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,940
I had a run of good luck.
I simply kept on winning.

113
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,720
That's when I buy presents
for everyone, including me.

114
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,940
You came on your own?

115
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,780
I'm joining Bill Schuster
in Munich.

116
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,680
He's an honest man.

117
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,940
First, I'd like to visit
Grandpa's grave.

118
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,280
I wasn't here
when he passed away.

119
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,300
That's my name.

120
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,460
We gave you your grandpa's name,

121
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
but for me,
you're my little Jacquot.

122
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,340
Seeing my name there
when I was so young

123
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,440
gave me a sense of the frailty
of our existence.

124
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,020
I'm so lucky!

125
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,540
I saw a little old lady
and grabbed her handbag.

126
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,220
No doubt about it,
I'm as slippery as an eel.

127
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,600
- Guignol!
- He's stolen a bag!

128
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,580
I saw a policeman,
so I've hidden it.

129
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,540
Here he comes!

130
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,380
Hello, Guignol.

131
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,340
Hello, Gnafron.

132
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,420
Hello, Brigadier.

133
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,460
Did you happen to see

134
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,460
a suspicious individual?

135
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,540
A purse snatcher!

136
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,300
Did any of you kids
see him around here?

137
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,320
He hid it under a bush!

138
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,900
All that for Reine?

139
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,080
It still smells of coffee
in here.

140
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,380
Are you a turtle?

141
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,380
None of your business.

142
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,420
- Can I keep the box?
- Take it if you like.

143
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,480
I want to make a puppet theater.

144
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,380
What I hear about Munich's
not good.

145
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,300
I wonder about that cousin
from Rio.

146
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,500
Off to see her Mr. Schuster...
Probably a spy.

147
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,480
She seemed sweet, though.

148
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:26,380
How could anything go well?
Why go at all? And where?

149
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,800
Madame de Saint-Clair is here.

150
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,440
I'd like to taper it
at the neck.

151
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,460
Mr. Cavalet is home.
Will that do?

152
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,060
Almost.

153
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,480
I'll just give it one last...

154
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,540
You made a Negro policeman?

155
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,340
- No, I didn't.
- Why's he black, then?

156
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,760
The potatoes go black.

157
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,260
I know...

158
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,300
I'll make the heads
out of cardboard.

159
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,140
Come along!

160
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,660
Hurry up, please!

161
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,360
- Next screening in 15 minutes!
- Snow White is pretty.

162
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,220
I liked the witch.

163
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,040
Of course you did.

164
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,660
- Grumpy's always grumpy.
- He didn't stop sneezing.

165
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,260
- That was Sneezy, dopey!
- You have to go see it.

166
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,300
It's great but scary.

167
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,100
My father promised to take me
if I get good grades.

168
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,140
- I'm going again tomorrow.
- Me too. I'm going on Sunday.

169
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,180
I've seen it too.

170
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,100
I like the witch best.

171
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,260
- He's into Snow White.
- Don't say that.

172
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,260
You said the was
the one for you.

173
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,300
I didn't, but she's OK.

174
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,260
She always sings
when she sweeps,

175
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,220
when she washes up,

176
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,040
and when she bakes cakes.

177
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,480
Mirror, mirror on the wall...

178
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,040
Mom they're outside!

179
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,000
Come see the giant dwarfs.

180
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,620
- You've got 'em all, even Dopey.
- Some chocolate?

181
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,480
Yes, please.
You're lucky to have 'em all.

182
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,600
Yes, please.
You're lucky to have 'em all.

183
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,780
No Snow White?

184
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,740
No, I couldn't care less
about her.

185
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,360
She can't do the splits,
but I can.

186
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,840
Now you try.

187
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
You're clumsy, try again.

188
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,020
Push down
and stretch your legs.

189
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,860
We could do an acrobatic act

190
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,820
and tour the world in a circus.

191
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,840
- If you like.
- Try again.

192
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,860
Push!

193
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,840
Keep it rolling with your stick.

194
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,880
The Three Musketeers!

195
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,640
Can you manage?

196
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
War! Mobilization!

197
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,220
All we needed!

198
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,520
God knows where I'll be sent.

199
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,760
You have a bad leg,
you'll stay here.

200
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,260
Take those sacks to the cellars
for a shelter.

201
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,260
We need some in the attics too.

202
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,380
If my two sons go off to war...

203
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,220
They'll test gas masks
at school.

204
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,180
Reine will look like a fly.

205
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,220
Me, a fly?

206
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,260
You have a fly up your nose,
Jacquot too.

207
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,360
But you'd be a beautiful fly.

208
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,120
I've given him a big mustache.

209
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,100
Look, will this do?

210
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,520
Yes.

211
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,080
It fits!

212
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,320
She's the one with the hair.

213
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,640
- You don't hit puppets.
- Just a bit.

214
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,760
Think it's here?

215
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,020
- Raymond Marcel Demy?
- That's me.

216
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,420
Your posting.

217
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,240
The arsenal isn't far.

218
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,080
I'll be home every night.

219
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,440
Better to make shells
than be hit by them.

220
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,040
Think they're asleep?
Check.

221
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,960
They're fine.

222
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,440
- Quite a change from a beret.
- Good luck, neighbor.

223
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,760
Your lunch bag.

224
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,220
Grandma, can you make a cape
for my puppet?

225
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,060
Not black like that,
but with this shiny cloth?

226
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,620
Of course, Jacquot,
but I must finish this.

227
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,260
Look at these pearls...

228
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,060
The woman's coming
for it tomorrow.

229
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,480
Then you can do mine next.

230
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,680
Sing me another song.
I like your songs.

231
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,300
- Do you know about witches?
- Not really.

232
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,300
They fly on broomsticks.

233
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,260
Do they wear Japanese kimonos?

234
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,020
You know all about costumes.

235
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,280
There's Grandma and Jacquot!

236
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,220
Four for Cinderella.

237
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,200
Coming, my little ones,
my elephants...

238
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,260
Coupons?

239
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,040
150 francs. Fine.

240
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,260
In Germany
they've requisitioned cars.

241
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,220
My husband wrote to hide ours.
I can't decide.

242
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,100
- Where is he?
- The Maginot Line.

243
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,140
Mine's busy making shells.

244
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,160
But he gets home every night.

245
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,140
- What's wrong?
- My guests haven't come.

246
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,560
- Be patient.
- Go look.

247
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,680
Wait, I have an idea.

248
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,200
Ready, children and elephants?

249
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,220
Here we go.
Open the curtains.

250
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,220
Here's Cinderella.

251
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,220
I'm so unhappy...

252
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,140
My wicked sisters
have gone to the ball

253
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,220
and I'm cleaning up.

254
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,220
- Poor girl.
- Here I am.

255
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,180
I am the Fairy.

256
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,220
The Lilac Fairy.

257
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,000
Want to go to the ball?
Just watch.

258
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,140
Don't forget to leave
at midnight.

259
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,280
First, I'll change your dress.

260
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,200
Here comes the stardust.

261
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,100
That's not stars, it's sand.

262
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,020
Lice!

263
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,020
Look at you!

264
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,280
Bend over the newspaper.

265
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,260
You know those Marchis kids
are full of lice.

266
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,260
They clapped, Mom,
and René and I bowed.

267
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,100
They're everywhere.

268
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,840
Let me see.

269
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,260
You can't, they're too small.

270
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,200
I'll put some lotion later.

271
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,260
- I've only got one left.
- I won these.

272
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,140
- You stole them.
- Don't argue.

273
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,140
Mind your own business, Demy.

274
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,300
- Give them back.
- I won them. You're the cheat.

275
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,080
We'd better go,
or we'll be late.

276
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,640
See you later.

277
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,740
Demy, a new poster!

278
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,060
"Silence.
Enemy ears are listening."

279
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,020
Are there enemies everywhere?

280
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,020
Of course!

281
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,460
Grandma and Mom read a book
called Mr. Spy and His Daughter.

282
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,340
The spies were disguised
as nuns.

283
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,020
You had to check their shoes.

284
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,120
Hurry up!

285
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,340
Don't dawdle, Demy!

286
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,560
- This OK?
- Fine. Mask on.

287
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:30,080
If there's a real alert,
I want no fuss.

288
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,080
Nuns!

289
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,000
Let's go check!

290
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,100
- Come with me to the toilet?
- Can't you go alone?

291
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,560
I'm scared.

292
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,240
I'm going to explore the cave...

293
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,280
There's a glow
in the distance...

294
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,840
Come back, Jacquot!

295
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,080
- It's as dark as hell in there.
- What's hell?

296
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,980
I wanna go to the fair!

297
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,240
It's for soldiers on leave.

298
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,240
- Let's go to the Guignol.
- We'll take a quick look first.

299
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,600
Hitler's head for 5 francs!

300
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,080
- Now to the Guignol!
- Now?

301
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,260
You're good, Father dear,

302
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,180
but before I marry you,

303
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,020
I want the skin
of that old donkey.

304
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,660
Never!

305
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,100
I insist, Father dear.

306
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,220
I can't possibly refuse you.

307
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,080
I say there!

308
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,060
Kill my donkey

309
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,060
and bring me his skin.

310
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,880
They won't really kill it...

311
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,180
How dreadful!

312
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,140
It's disgusting.

313
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,160
Fairy godmother,
what shall I do?

314
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,220
- Disguise yourself...
- You have strange ideas.

315
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
Come on, hurry.

316
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,620
- Put this skin on.
- How awful!

317
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,000
Just do as I tell you.

318
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,320
From now on,
we'll call you Donkey Skin.

319
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,440
Mom, there's no more school!

320
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,060
Due to the war.

321
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,040
Watch out.

322
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,100
Is the garage open?

323
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,240
Not really,
but maybe the mechanic can help.

324
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,320
Can I have some water?

325
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,220
- Been on the road long?
- We've driven from Bruges.

326
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,040
Come in for a moment.

327
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,140
We fled.

328
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,260
We heard they were raping women
and cutting off kids' hands.

329
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,320
We left in a panic.

330
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,180
Too late, Mrs. Demy.
We're closing.

331
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,180
For good?

332
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,100
The Germans will soon be here.
They ransack and kill.

333
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,100
- We're leaving.
- All of you?

334
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,080
We're going back to the farm.

335
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,680
- Are you off too?
- I don't know.

336
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,760
Do you want to leave?

337
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,960
I don't know.

338
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,180
The Germans are coming.
Are we going or not?

339
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,300
Where to?

340
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,960
I can't leave Grandma behind.

341
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,540
- Can you help us?
- Lend us some civilian clothes.

342
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,160
- Sorry, we're leaving.
- Over here, guys!

343
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,440
Get some overalls.

344
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,880
We don't even know
if we're still at war.

345
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,040
Catch.

346
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
- Here.
- Thanks, boy.

347
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,720
- Isn't Reine here?
- No.

348
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,180
She's staying with my sister.

349
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,300
- No news of your husband?
- I'm still waiting.

350
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,560
I worry, but I go to work.

351
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,180
German's a weird language.

352
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,200
Hush! Look at the poster...

353
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,260
You're taking them to the river?

354
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,220
Yes, I've got to pick up
some mattresses.

355
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,020
- They'll keep the girl company.
- No swimming on their own!

356
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,100
Don't you worry.

357
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,520
Let's go!

358
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,080
You get in here.
René, you climb in the back.

359
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,740
She's a refugee,
from friends of friends.

360
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,100
She was a wonder
from Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois

361
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,300
and very pretty indeed.

362
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,120
No, not like that.
Like this.

363
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,140
What's your name?

364
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,120
Geneviève from
Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois.

365
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,120
Move your arms more.

366
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,520
Shall we show her the stairs?

367
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,380
Then,
there's a little staircase.

368
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,600
Coming?

369
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,160
You keep watch.

370
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,040
My turn.

371
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,020
The witch's door is open.

372
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,080
Maybe it was burglars.

373
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,040
Let's look inside.

374
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,080
Can I see?

375
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,040
Think she's dead?

376
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:25,120
Hush, don't say a word.

377
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,240
Don't worry, it'll be fun.

378
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,180
- We won't be able to play cars.
- Then play cars now.

379
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,600
Off we go!

380
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,180
We're going for a drive.

381
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,100
Along the banks of the Loire.

382
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,200
Careful, I can't swim!

383
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,220
Put that down.
You mustn't touch everything.

384
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,000
They've got to have fun.
It's all new to them.

385
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,140
What's this for?

386
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,280
Pouring water on the grindstone
to sharpen the tools.

387
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,180
Thirsty? Then drink.

388
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
I've brought their things.

389
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:36,020
Old Georges told me
to take kids from Nantes.

390
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,180
He told me the clog-maker
is a good man.

391
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,040
Looks like he was right.

392
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,080
They seem pale.
The fresh air will do them good.

393
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,980
- We don't see the war here.
- Except there's no tobacco.

394
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,100
- I'll give you money.
- Later.

395
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,260
We'd better go.

396
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,280
- I've never left them.
- They're in good hands.

397
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,060
Come on.
Let's go feed the rabbits.

398
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,960
I want to feed the rabbits too.

399
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,080
- Bye, children.
- Bye!

400
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,220
You don't cut yourself
on that knife?

401
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,160
I've been making clogs
for 30 years.

402
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,000
Home we go, little fellow.

403
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,140
"My darlings,

404
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,100
"Here are some transfers

405
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,140
"...and a badge
of the arms of Nantes,

406
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,220
"since you said
you wanted a badge.

407
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,460
"Say hello to Aunt Léa
and the clog maker.

408
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,180
"Big kiss from Dad and Mom,

409
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,640
"Marilou."

410
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,180
Not bad, huh?

411
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,020
Great badge.

412
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,060
They don't have them
in the country.

413
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,020
- Where'd you get it?
- Little Demy, how you've grown!

414
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,420
The country air
has done you good.

415
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,340
The washing.

416
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,040
Thank you.
Goodbye, Mrs. Le Dentec.

417
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,120
It's nice to have you back.

418
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,360
Jacquot, take off your beret.

419
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,260
I've made a real feast:
pasta with cheese and sausage,

420
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,220
from the sausage lady.

421
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,140
- Luce, who sings in church?
- Indeed.

422
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,540
Glad to be home, boys?

423
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,260
Yes, Dad.

424
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,320
I wanna go to the cinema
and the circus.

425
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,740
I'll take you,
or your father will.

426
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,480
All Dad likes is boules!

427
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,480
It feels good to be a family.

428
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,380
Back to catechism class.
First Communion in May.

429
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,760
Yes, Mom.

430
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:55,020
- You're late.
- Catechism went on forever.

431
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,220
I know, so I hope you pass
your First Communion test.

432
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,220
- Your sister passed first time.
- He knows.

433
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,680
He knows his catechism.
At least, I hope so.

434
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,180
Can you help us fix up
a trapeze?

435
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,160
I'd better ask your dad,
or you ask Guy.

436
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,600
This beam?

437
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,300
"Lift up your souls,
yet remain modest,"

438
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,200
as our priest says.

439
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,680
- Missed!
- Your turn!

440
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,240
- You'll do it, Robert?
- Yes, later.

441
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,020
Look at Reine's shutters.
Isn't she back?

442
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,060
We don't see much of her.
She's taken on airs.

443
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,020
Field Commander Holt
was shot in the back.

444
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,020
There's a curfew at 4 PM.

445
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,780
There'll be reprisals.

446
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,060
It happened on
Rue du Roi Albert.

447
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,440
- On your way to catechism?
- Yes.

448
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,380
"Cowardly criminals working
for England and Moscow

449
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,360
"shot the Nantes field commander
in the back on October 20.

450
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,340
"The murderers
have yet to be caught.

451
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,300
"To punish this crime

452
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,220
"I have ordered that
50 hostages be shot."

453
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,280
"Due to the gravity of
the crime, 50 more hostages..."

454
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,140
- 15 million for informers!
- More than Judas got.

455
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,140
50 innocent people shot?

456
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,140
It's true.
My father said so.

457
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,300
The occupation: A quiet war.

458
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,160
It's easy to lay down
the law with guns.

459
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:15,300
- We shouldn't see German films.
- I know, my father told me.

460
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,100
But it looks terrific.

461
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,280
- And it's in color.
- What a pity.

462
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,580
Prévert wrote it.
It's a sad love story.

463
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,160
Let's see it.

464
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,160
Three for
"Les Visiteurs du Soir."

465
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,140
Gluttony is a sin, my boy,
but it's your First Communion.

466
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,140
Roast pork...

467
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,180
You've saved our bacon!

468
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,260
If you put it there
it'll get cooked.

469
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,120
No, I'm using gas, it'll
fool them at the checkpoint.

470
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,180
- Thanks.
- See you tomorrow.

471
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,600
I'll come early
to help your wife.

472
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,160
Radio Paris lies...

473
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,280
Radio Paris is German!

474
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,160
We'll take the tape off
the windows.

475
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,300
We took the flour
and the sugar to the baker's.

476
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,140
How wonderful!

477
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,180
It's like before the war.

478
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,220
- An actual tiered cake.
- It's been ages.

479
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,340
- I can't eat anymore.
- I can.

480
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,120
Don't eat, Luce, sing.

481
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,240
Sing us a song!

482
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,660
Let's sing another.

483
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,440
"Little Lison."

484
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,160
It's going well.

485
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,660
You're as handsome as a prince!
What'd you get as a present?

486
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,260
A gramophone.

487
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,300
- Got any records?
- Two.

488
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,320
I can lend you some.

489
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,320
Listen to this, Guy.

490
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,160
Music? Sure.

491
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,160
I like ball bearings.

492
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,140
It's great.

493
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,140
You can see all the chimneys.
You're lucky.

494
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,560
You can look again if you like.

495
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,580
Is it true you can see
Le Normandie?

496
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,360
Yes.

497
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,560
Let's see.

498
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,680
- Let's swap.
- For what?

499
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,480
Ball bearings.

500
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,680
Two sets.

501
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,600
Yes. See you.

502
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,940
What you showed
Le Gerrec was film?

503
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,100
Yes, movie film.

504
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,860
- Where'd you find it?
- What'll you give me?

505
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,140
- Ball bearings.
- No.

506
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,980
- Two sets.
- I want the pencil sharpener.

507
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,600
Then give me the film
and tell me where you found it.

508
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,120
- It's Le Normandie?
- Yes.

509
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,180
Watch out.

510
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,100
Gypsies are dangerous.
Don't ever go near them.

511
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,520
I don't care.
That's not why I came.

512
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,980
Mine's got a plane.
I think it's a Messerschmitt.

513
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,180
- I've got a tank.
- It's German newsreel.

514
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,220
We shouldn't have...
It must be forbidden.

515
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,640
It's OK, we found 'em in a dump!

516
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,600
- We oughta take 'em back...
- Don't be silly!

517
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,060
These spoils of war,

518
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,220
a few feet of real film,
eagerly brought home by Jacquot,

519
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,060
had no time to become a fetish

520
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,100
and catalyze his passion.

521
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:37,240
Marilou considered them to be
"compromising documents."

522
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,440
Jacquot had lost Le Normandie
for nothing.

523
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,060
Aunt Nique!

524
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,840
Your stocking seam
looks like a snake!

525
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,620
Since I am asked
to justify myself,

526
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,580
Monsieur Pitou
loves Mademoiselle Clairette

527
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,200
and she loves him too.

528
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,400
It's cold.

529
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,240
Those Krauts are ugly.
Jean Marais is handsome.

530
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:06,580
- 4:15. What's the holdup?
- They like making us wait.

531
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,060
They take their time.

532
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,180
Look: "Filming on a farm:
Jean Choux and his crew."

533
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,340
- Ducks too.
- Some crew!

534
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,260
Jean Gourget's new film,
"Malaria,"

535
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,640
will entirely be set
in the Tropics.

536
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,260
About time.

537
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:28,260
"I want 'Malaria' to have
an atmosphere of fear," he says.

538
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:32,100
"Mireille Balin plays a colonial
wife suffering from malaria.

539
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:36,100
"Sessue Hayakawa plays
a native boy, a guitar player.

540
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,240
"Love erupts between
these two feverish beings."

541
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,220
- Mireille Balin's beautiful!
- "Beautiful"?

542
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,260
I know what I'm talking about.

543
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,420
That one doesn't look bad.

544
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,680
A guy falling from a tree.
There's blood everywhere!

545
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,160
He's sweet.
He blows up my tires.

546
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,240
Don't forget the valve.

547
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,500
You ride your mom around?

548
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,160
She's a neighbor.
She's going for her coupons.

549
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,340
Now you can go.

550
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,040
I'm going out
to get some biscottes.

551
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,300
- I'm scared.
- We've got a shelter.

552
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,720
- I want to go.
- We'll all go.

553
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,180
What a racket.
It's hell!

554
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,060
I'm scared.

555
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,200
I feel sick.

556
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,140
It'll soon be over.

557
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,020
Look how calm Jacquot is.

558
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,000
Remember the cave?
It was as dark as hell.

559
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,920
I'm frightened.

560
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,100
On September 16, 1943,

561
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:11,200
I discovered the full horror
of violence and destruction.

562
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,140
There were dead all over town,

563
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,560
people screaming and dying
beneath the rubble.

564
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,100
It was the Apocalypse.

565
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:25,040
Ever since, I've hated violence.

566
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,480
My city kids...

567
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,260
I knew we'd see you.

568
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,680
We thought we'd just show up.

569
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,280
There's no electricity.
It's a total disaster.

570
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,180
- It was dreadful.
- We heard it too.

571
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,660
Come see the rabbits.
Remember the white one?

572
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:21,260
It was all craters and smoke,
people looking for each other...

573
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,140
I was in the street too.

574
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:26,180
People were trapped.
I heard them shouting.

575
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,580
- On your own?
- I was looking for Dad.

576
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,340
I was fixing a car
on Avenue des Américains.

577
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,220
I got under it just in time.

578
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,940
- Americans? You brought them.
- Don't be stupid.

579
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,460
Still,
our allies bombing Nantes...

580
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,100
Destroying Nantes, you mean.

581
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,300
Filthy Krauts!
It's all their fault.

582
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,260
- We're no trouble?
- No, we'll all squeeze in.

583
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,100
I won't be here long.

584
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:53,060
I'll go back to the garage
as soon as we get

585
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,180
the electricity back.

586
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,600
He always has his gramophone.

587
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,720
Come on in.

588
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,060
Come to bed, Jacquot.
I'm sleepy.

589
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,640
- Go to sleep on your own.
- Under the covers, boy.

590
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,980
Are your feet all right now?

591
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,440
Yes.

592
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,360
You'll get used to them.

593
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,760
Finishing your clog today?

594
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,320
No, not that chisel.

595
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,880
Here.

596
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,300
I'm teaching you a trade,
but you'll never take it up.

597
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:51,060
- You'll have better to do.
- I'm going to make sets.

598
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,260
Sets?

599
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,100
Theater and cinema sets,

600
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,600
and puppet shows.

601
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,800
Don't walk over the bridge
at Mauves!

602
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,400
Missed!

603
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:09,000
Enough reading for today.
Time to swap.

604
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,940
The past participle agrees with

605
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,460
the gender and plural
of the subject

606
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,600
when it is placed before.

607
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,060
Example:

608
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,500
"La bille qu'il a prise
est bleue."

609
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,440
What did he take?
"La bille."

610
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:45,580
- Listen to me.
- Things are heating up.

611
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,380
"Bille," feminine,
precedes the verb,

612
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,800
so the color is feminine too.

613
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,760
Don't be scared.

614
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:17,700
Every time I hesitate over
a past participle agreement,

615
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:21,660
I recall the school classroom
at Mauves

616
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,460
and that parachute

617
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,400
floating down over the Loire.

618
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:40,640
- A late visitor.
- Come in!

619
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,960
"Un Visiteur du Soir."

620
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,600
Here's our neighbor.

621
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,660
The Germans raided the café

622
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:53,420
to get young men
to do forced labor.

623
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,540
They took Gaston and Paul.

624
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,420
Luckily, the others
managed to get away.

625
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,500
- Damn Germans!
- And Gilles too.

626
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,620
Gilles and Dominique,
Dominique and Gilles...

627
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,720
They didn't take Dominique.

628
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:12,340
- From "Les Visiteurs du Soir."
- He only thinks about films.

629
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:16,460
You should go see the old
Gallon sisters, the teachers.

630
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,580
They had a projector and some Chaplin films.

631
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,480
- Shorts.
- Great idea. The boy's bored.

632
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,760
Be careful, OK?

633
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,500
- Regularly and gently.
- Fairly gently, actually.

634
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,920
Here are the films.

635
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:43,160
You'll bring it back, won't you?

636
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:55,460
This country lettuce
is delicious.

637
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:58,220
We eat it every day.

638
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,560
- Pleased to see your parents?
- Yes.

639
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,460
Dad gave me a present.

640
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,360
Presents always work.

641
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,880
- What do we do?
- Don't move.

642
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,560
- Your bike!
- Be quiet.

643
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:42,660
Come, it's ready.

644
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:45,540
Look, Mom, the projector.

645
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,660
No, I'm the projectionist.

646
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,800
Look at the screen, Dad.

647
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,360
Sit down.

648
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,840
I've seen it.

649
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,400
- It doesn't work.
- Be patient.

650
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:13,320
What are they eating?
Soap? Bubble soup!

651
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,540
Jacquot was as thrilled

652
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,660
as if he'd made
the film himself.

653
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:29,920
He happily ended his days at the
clog maker's by showing films.

654
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,180
The Loire had become dangerous.

655
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,180
Americans occupied one bank,

656
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,480
Germans and the Resistance
the other.

657
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,660
It was time to go home,

658
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:49,260
back to the sand,
the long porch,

659
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,120
and the garage courtyard.

660
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,720
The Americans are here!

661
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:28,360
White wine for everyone!

662
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:55,440
Coming?

663
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,560
It's Chopin.

664
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,520
I like it here.

665
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,280
A jazzed-up Chopin!

666
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:31,880
- It sounds good.
- But it's written for the piano.

667
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,500
Thanks, I'll take it.

668
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,800
OK.

669
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,500
I've been in this scene before.

670
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,460
But the other was lent
and this is a gift.

671
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,540
It's not worth much.

672
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,620
Dad'll buy an electric model.

673
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,500
When it's worth less,
give it to me.

674
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,520
- I'm your junk-collector cousin.
- Don't be silly!

675
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,880
See you.

676
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,540
Where am I going
to put my stuff?

677
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,380
You need room for a cinema.

678
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,160
You're going too far.

679
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:16,880
I need cardboard boxes,
glue and fairy lights.

680
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,320
Give me some money?

681
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:47,400
- Chaplin is funny.
- I've seen it countless times.

682
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,020
Pillars just like
at the Olympic.

683
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,380
He did it all himself
except for the curtain.

684
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,380
Come have some coffee.

685
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,420
Let him put it away.

686
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,460
I've only got one film.

687
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:05,380
If only I could rub it out
and change it.

688
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,380
- Don't ask me.
- You should buy me more.

689
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,800
Not now.

690
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:14,500
- Fix my hairdo?
- I don't do hair anymore.

691
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,420
What with the boys
and the garage...

692
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,520
I even do the bookkeeping.

693
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,520
Let's see your hair...

694
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:26,140
- What are you up to?
- I'll try to make a new film.

695
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:31,440
- The saucepan will poison us.
- Tell Mom you'll rinse it well.

696
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,460
- I can't wait for the sequel.
- Same here.

697
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:44,820
I like when she says,
"a glimmer like everyone."

698
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:48,140
She talks about her mother,
a laundress.

699
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:50,360
It's a fine love story.

700
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,880
It's a masterpiece.

701
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,680
You'll ruin your eyes.

702
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:24,100
"The Bridge at Mauves."

703
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:28,260
- You can see the crossbars.
- It was hard to draw.

704
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,680
It's so tiny.

705
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:41,180
Mom, it's serious.
It's a cartoon newsreel.

706
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,260
Fine.

707
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,360
"The planes are flying away."

708
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,180
Did you like it?

709
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,800
It was very good.

710
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,980
Bras!

711
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,300
- He's into ladies' underwear!
- Just looking.

712
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:03,260
- Research.
- Today's youth...

713
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:06,160
Make your own way home,
Jacquot.

714
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,220
Come see.

715
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:12,500
Women go into that shop
and then they disappear.

716
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,440
- Who told you that?
- Someone.

717
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,260
- Them?
- Who knows?

718
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,260
- It's a fairy tale.
- No, a drama.

719
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:24,320
They're sold as slaves
to harems in Argentina.

720
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,240
Sheet music.

721
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,680
Aunt Nique has the same one.

722
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,660
- What's what?
- Junk.

723
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:55,400
- Let's go!
- No, this is amazing.

724
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,220
Anything in particular?

725
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:09,380
No.

726
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:13,700
Actually, what's that camera
with the handle in the window?

727
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,400
- A movie camera.
- To make real films?

728
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:20,380
- 9.5 mm. For amateurs.
- Does it work?

729
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,180
If you put film in.

730
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:26,300
I'd love to be an amateur,
but I don't have any money.

731
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,720
We could swap.
Got any books or games?

732
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,260
Slow down!

733
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:39,380
- What's eating him?
- He'll get over it.

734
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,380
How are you, Mr. Dubuisson.

735
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,800
Time for a fill-up and a chat.

736
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,300
I was looking for you.
Time to say good-bye.

737
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:47,200
I didn't want you to go
knowing you were angry...

738
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,260
So I got the camera,

739
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:59,160
but I had no idea how to use it.

740
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:03,280
Luckily,
there was an instruction book.

741
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:07,380
I was in a hurry to learn
all those barbaric terms

742
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:11,180
like f-stop,
orthochromatic film,

743
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,300
panchromatic vision filter,
film stock...

744
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,500
As soon as I'd read it,
I decided I wanted

745
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:20,300
to make the script
used as an example:

746
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,460
- "Solange's Adventure."
- There you are.

747
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:25,700
I've learned lots of words:
Emulsion speed, f-stop,

748
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,500
shutter, ortho, panchro,
depth of field.

749
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:31,380
Good for you.
But it's all Chinese to me.

750
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:34,240
Is that what you learn
at school?

751
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,580
"'Solange's Adventure.'"

752
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:39,160
Solange, 5,
her parents, a prowler."

753
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:44,420
"Despite being forbidden to,
Solange plays in the street.

754
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:47,780
'A prowler promises her sweets
and kidnaps her."

755
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,380
Hey! I'm making a film.

756
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:54,140
I need a tall guy for the gypsy.
Come Thursday to the garage?

757
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,180
- Where?
- Quai des Tanneurs.

758
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,400
OK, I'll come.

759
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:04,260
- I'll be home late.
- Don't worry. It'll be open.

760
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:07,180
"A gipsy makes her dance
at fairs,

761
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:10,180
"but her mother recognizes her
thanks to a locket.

762
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:15,260
"This family film will have
more appeal than a reel

763
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:18,380
"of some young star
pointlessly posing..."

764
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,380
- You learn this at school?
- Yvon asked me that.

765
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:22,820
My fur!

766
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:25,260
- Lend it to me?
- What for?

767
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,180
For Yvon.
He's playing Solange's mother.

768
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,380
René's little brother
is Solange.

769
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,440
- What's all this?
- Watch it!

770
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:39,460
I don't like being a girl.

771
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:42,220
We need a dress, makeup,

772
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:43,260
and a hat.

773
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,200
I'll go to Madame Bredin's.

774
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,240
- It's ready.
- Thanks.

775
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:54,560
Reine used to wear it.

776
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:02,080
- This is a real circus.
- Stop making faces.

777
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,240
- You look pretty, Yvon.
- Come out.

778
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:12,260
Yvon, explain to Solange
she mustn't go out alone.

779
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,680
Now walk slowly towards me.

780
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,780
Good. That'll do.

781
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,380
Lorca, I'll show you
where to go.

782
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,260
You hide here.
René...

783
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,680
We'll do a full-face shot
of him.

784
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:36,100
Solange, you play with
your ball, you drop it,

785
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,720
and turn right.

786
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,460
You're the kidnapper!

787
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:44,300
"Soon after, a character
offers her sweets,

788
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,300
"then wraps her in his cape."

789
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,320
Stride after her

790
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,160
and offer her sweets.

791
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:55,260
- You like sweets, pretty girl?
- Yes, sir.

792
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,440
Then you'll get some!
Fight back!

793
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,340
"Six months later."
Want to be older?

794
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:19,340
No, it's for my film.

795
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,760
Good news in the paper:

796
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,360
Germany has surrendered.

797
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:59,900
Move your belly
without moving your feet.

798
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,220
Move your head too.

799
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,640
Now we'll do it with the others.

800
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:16,540
I'll place you with your drum.
You, dance.

801
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:20,980
You, beat time on the drum.
OK, I'm shooting.

802
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,640
Bang harder, Lorca.

803
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,720
Then the mother arrives.

804
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,260
Listen, we move back...

805
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:36,260
You come forward, and when
you see her dancing, say, "Hey!"

806
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:39,140
Not now!
Move back!

807
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,180
When we're shooting.

808
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,620
Recognize your daughter.

809
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:45,600
That's Solange's locket!

810
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,180
What are you doing?

811
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,260
Wrapping up my first takes

812
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:06,280
to send them to the Pathé Lab
in Joinville-le-Pont.

813
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:30,320
- Nothing for me?
- Not today, son.

814
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:02,180
It'll be a fine cardigan.

815
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,300
You need patience to knit.

816
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,820
I'm the patient one.
I've been waiting two months!

817
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:11,060
The labs reopen,
but I keep waiting.

818
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:15,080
I'm really fed up.
And you only knit for Dad!

819
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:55,540
Then one fine day,
the film arrived.

820
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,140
What excitement!

821
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:00,340
I loaded it.
Not a thing!

822
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:03,280
It was absolutely,
totally transparent.

823
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,920
I'd forgotten
to adjust the f-stop.

824
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:13,660
Clearly,
I had to learn the technique.

825
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:16,680
- What's wrong?
- I wanna go to film school.

826
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,820
We'll ask your father.

827
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,700
He'll say,

828
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:26,960
"Are you nuts? Thinking
about films at your age!"

829
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,860
"Are you nuts? Thinking
about films at your age!"

830
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,740
Learn a trade
in a technical school.

831
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,900
You'll be a mechanic.

832
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:38,160
I want to go to high school.

833
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,640
Great, veal with prunes!

834
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,140
I want to graduate.

835
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:50,360
Tech gives you a trade.
High school, nothing.

836
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,880
Concentrate.

837
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:02,760
Go on, turn it.

838
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,780
If he picks on me again,
I'm off.

839
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,740
- Where to?
- Who cares?

840
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,900
Africa, to teach mechanics
to the locals.

841
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,880
That's it,
clear off to Timbuktu!

842
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,660
I'd head for Paris.

843
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,900
I'd be an extra at the Opera.

844
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:35,900
They'll take anyone.
One of my mom's clients told me.

845
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:39,900
No need to sing,
just hammer it out at the back.

846
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,720
I'll be all right
at the Opera, then!

847
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:20,300
I absolutely must go to Paris.

848
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:22,780
I'm going too, but later on.

849
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:26,740
Dad says I must finish tech.
Meanwhile, I make films.

850
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:28,420
With that?

851
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:32,860
I have an idea for a film.
You'd be terrific in it.

852
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,700
But you and your camera
are small-time.

853
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:37,880
I've got big projects.

854
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:43,740
Remember my aunt from Rio,
the flirtatious one?

855
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,940
She batted her eyelashes.
She was fun.

856
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:50,340
- A great role.
- Wasn't she a casino gambler?

857
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:51,940
Yes.

858
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:55,560
We'll do a scene
where you win lots of money.

859
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,820
Go back to your dreams, Jacquot.

860
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,960
I've got my own.

861
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:16,320
- How's it coming along?
- I've given up on actresses.

862
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,900
It's better to make cartoons.

863
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:23,820
The stars are cardboard in cardboard sets.

864
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,780
You want some cardboard?

865
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:27,840
- Can I have some?
- Of course.

866
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,740
Thanks, Mr. Sweets.

867
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,080
Am I Mr. Sweets forever?

868
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,840
- Can I come back for more?
- Whenever you like, son.

869
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:45,880
The boy had a project
and he needed space.

870
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:51,960
The attic next to the tires was
ideal and he made it his own.

871
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:57,820
A new life
of peace and quiet started,

872
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,820
far from the noise of the tech,

873
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,640
a little less
from that of the garage.

874
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:23,940
What are you making?

875
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:25,840
- A ballerina.
- What's that?

876
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,360
A dancing girl.

877
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:58,540
She looks different
with her blond wig.

878
01:28:58,560 --> 01:28:59,740
Who?

879
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,940
Viviane Romance.
She was in Carmen.

880
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:04,700
We saw that.
It was good.

881
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:06,740
- Nice costumes...
- Yes.

882
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:10,640
Directed by Marcel L'Herbier,
so you know it's good.

883
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,940
Show me.
Or I won't get it.

884
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,960
Come on, then, I'll explain.

885
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,880
Look.

886
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,480
You're well set up.

887
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,740
Don't touch, it's fragile.

888
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,820
Not by the camera...
It's exactly in place.

889
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:35,780
If I want the little dancer
to move,

890
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,820
I move her leg
and shoot a frame.

891
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:42,020
I keep doing the same thing...

892
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:43,920
Got it?

893
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:46,780
It's continuous movement.

894
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,760
If you film an arm,

895
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,900
you get continuous movement.

896
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:56,280
You can climb down now.
I really need to focus.

897
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,860
It's blurry and out of focus.

898
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,960
This is not good.

899
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:27,780
I've got the patience.

900
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:30,400
With a new camera,
I'd start again.

901
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,900
I'm glad we're here.

902
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:42,800
I've talked to the merchant.
He says it's a bargain.

903
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,760
It's that one.

904
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:49,820
It's more stable.

905
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,660
Automatic beats
cranking the handle.

906
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:55,100
If you say so.
Shall we go in?

907
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,700
It's your present.

908
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,780
Thanks so much.

909
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,680
This camera, an Ercsam Camex,

910
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:04,840
was the one I used.

911
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,760
It shot frame by frame.

912
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:39,780
Car headlamps aren't ideal
for lighting sets.

913
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:43,620
We're a bit tight.
People are paying late.

914
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:46,700
Mr. Debuisson
owes me 2 months of work.

915
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:48,660
He's talking to Mom.

916
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:50,680
Hello, Mr. Debuisson!

917
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:58,900
How's the tech?

918
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,900
My marks are fine,
but it's boring.

919
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:02,660
Not again!

920
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:05,780
It's hard for an artist
not to get his own way.

921
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:08,780
- You should see the attic.
- You haven't!

922
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,740
I'm afraid of heights.

923
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:12,720
- Can I see?
- Of course.

924
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,940
The cartoon was terrific.

925
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:32,920
That's what I want to do.

926
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:34,820
I need equipment.

927
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:37,900
Every Sunday it's the same:

928
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,900
"I don't want to be a mechanic.
I want to study filmmaking."

929
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:45,700
We got him a camera.
Now he wants lights, a tripod...

930
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:47,700
It never ends!

931
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:49,880
- Calm down, Raymond.
- He should!

932
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,780
You're hard on Jacquot.
He works hard.

933
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,720
Let him have fun.

934
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:30,900
I forgot to buy a pound cake.

935
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:33,700
I'm not a baby.
Cake won't work.

936
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:36,740
Sweets never hurt
those who sulk.

937
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:39,740
You've been fuming for an hour.

938
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,900
'Cause Dad drives me crazy.

939
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:46,740
It's a sin.
So is sulking.

940
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:48,740
Laugh!

941
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:51,340
Even if you're sad!

942
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:54,900
Ask your dad what happened
when he came to Nantes

943
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:57,820
from the country...

944
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,700
His "studio"

945
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:02,080
in a drunk's house,
a Colonel's widow.

946
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,800
OK, here we go.

947
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:42,400
Turn it on, Yvon.

948
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:47,820
His father agreed
to cut the door in half.

949
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,920
- Why?
- Projector noise.

950
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:53,060
We have the world's
smallest cinema.

951
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:56,900
- I'm flattered to be invited.
- You're Jacquot's main supplier.

952
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:58,700
And my friend.

953
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:01,640
Let's open the curtains.

954
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,920
Screen! Music!

955
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:41,080
Lights!

956
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:44,880
Short but sweet!

957
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:49,720
Sailors are fun.

958
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:54,700
Mountain-climbing's great.

959
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:56,700
The mountain can wait.

960
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:59,140
Beauty and the Beast is a must.

961
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:02,680
- Really?
- Yes! I'd even see it again.

962
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:08,940
You let me help you, but you
never let me in your attic.

963
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,820
That's normal.

964
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:14,280
- What should we go see, Demy?
- He always knows.

965
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:18,500
Actually,

966
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:22,340
Duvivier's "Untel Père et Fils"
is good.

967
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:25,340
I've seen "Caprice,"
with Danielle Darrieux.

968
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:28,680
- We know what you think of her.
- Let's see.

969
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,460
Edith Piaf.
I adore her.

970
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:35,500
Quite the songbird.

971
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:38,260
- I'm making a film in my attic.
- What's it about?

972
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:42,260
A purse snatcher escaping
over the roofs of Paris.

973
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:45,680
"Attaque Nocturne."
It'll take months to complete.

974
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:01,340
Four seasons had passed.
Or a few, in any case.

975
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:04,420
Between fitting and welding,
Jacquot's French teacher

976
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:06,380
introduced him
to classical music.

977
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:09,300
He bought a copy of this record,

978
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:11,580
but remained faithful
to the waltzes

979
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,880
that suited "Attaque Nocturne."

980
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,380
Jacquot had grown.

981
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,280
He had changed.

982
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:38,300
When he came down for meals,

983
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:41,200
he didn't say much,
which worried his mother.

984
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:47,320
Yvon, Jacquot is here.

985
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:52,420
When his father
came up for a new tire,

986
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:56,260
he never looked at the cardboard
city his son inhabited.

987
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:58,680
Yvon was becoming an athlete.

988
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:01,340
Jacquot visited his grandmother

989
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,460
and went to the cinema a lot,

990
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:06,260
or walked towards the port.

991
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:10,440
He was pulling at his moorings.
Jacquot was becoming Jacques.

992
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,520
He still whined about the tech.

993
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:19,160
I hated that technical school.

994
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:23,260
Thumping my sheet metal
felt like hitting my father,

995
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:25,420
or letting off steam.

996
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:29,280
I had to get out of there,
find a solution.

997
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:33,400
While I made
a mortise and tenon,

998
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:37,680
it was Hollywood
that was on my mind.

999
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:51,020
Is this going
around the client's neck?

1000
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:52,460
Start again.

1001
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:55,620
Fitting a tire
without the inner tube!

1002
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:59,380
I'll give you a hand.
It ain't a champagne omelet.

1003
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:02,380
- What were you thinking of?
- Hollywood, of course!

1004
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,240
Some mechanic...

1005
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,060
Rita has a shapely figure.

1006
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:13,220
She was the GIs' mascot.
They had her everywhere.

1007
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,460
Even on the dreaded
Hiroshima bomb.

1008
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:19,240
- You believe that?
- Yes, she was a bombshell.

1009
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,780
Let's screen this film.

1010
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:25,400
You'll see.

1011
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:29,260
I saw it ages ago,
it may be no good.

1012
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,560
Still, let's take a look.

1013
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:34,360
- Can I switch it on?
- Wait...

1014
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:07,440
This way, please.

1015
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:13,340
I like the title:
"Le Port de l'angoisse."

1016
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:15,300
That's the French title.

1017
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:19,380
Remember the scene where
Bogart picks his passengers up?

1018
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:23,380
- Yes, that's "day for night."
- It was shot in daylight.

1019
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:26,300
- And the moonlight?
- There isn't any.

1020
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:29,380
It's the sun's reflection
through a red filter.

1021
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:31,220
To shoot moonlight,

1022
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:33,380
you need sunshine
as backlighting

1023
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:37,340
with a reflection on water,
a shiny surface of some kind.

1024
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:40,300
You need to have a precise angle

1025
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:44,740
between the camera, the backlit
characters and the sun.

1026
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:47,000
- How do you know?
- I learned it.

1027
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:10,360
That dress is too tight.

1028
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:12,380
At least they can see!

1029
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:16,220
It's nothing to be proud of.
What do I say to people?

1030
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:19,300
Friends and neighbors?
It's none of their business.

1031
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:23,300
- You never tell me anything.
- Say I'm getting married.

1032
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:26,280
- Good idea.
- Then I'll go find a husband.

1033
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:38,100
- Quite a fuss!
- That's right.

1034
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:40,300
What'll you do?

1035
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:43,420
Nothing, but my mother
wants me married.

1036
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:45,860
- Who with?
- I don't know.

1037
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:50,200
I don't know anyone who wants to
and you're much too young.

1038
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:58,500
- Coming to the carnival?
- I hate carnivals.

1039
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:01,300
I'm going back upstairs.
Are you going?

1040
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:04,220
I'm going with my chums
to see Mr Obligi.

1041
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:08,280
- He films for the news.
- Sure it's not to go dancing?

1042
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:13,300
Come back
for my baby's christening!

1043
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:15,640
I'll just take a quick look.

1044
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,340
What's your name?

1045
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:34,160
Josiane.

1046
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:13,140
I'm sick of operettas.

1047
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:16,460
You see it all from one place.
At the movies, your eyes move.

1048
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:20,040
You can see faces and details.
It's better.

1049
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:38,440
- Dad! My drawing teacher's here.
- Hang on.

1050
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:41,800
I told you, remember?
The one who likes me.

1051
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,220
Let me finish.

1052
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:47,200
I asked him to drop by.

1053
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:50,560
He's with Mom.
Come talk to him.

1054
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:55,300
It's not reasonable
to think about the cinema.

1055
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:58,420
He tinkers in the attic.
I know he's very gifted.

1056
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:03,280
But the cinema is another world.
Many are called, few are chosen.

1057
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:07,160
Help him get rid
of his illusions.

1058
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:22,220
- He left?
- He was in a hurry.

1059
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:23,380
Coffee?

1060
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:26,220
- Didn't he say anything?
- Not really.

1061
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:28,460
Coffee or cocoa, Jacquot?

1062
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:31,440
- Why did he come, then?
- Come inside.

1063
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:05,220
There's no love, Hélène.

1064
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:07,240
Only proof of love.

1065
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,340
Everything OK?

1066
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:02,240
- Yes, fine.
- What's this setup?

1067
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:04,700
Do you roller-skate?

1068
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:07,380
To do sweeping crane shots,

1069
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:11,420
I had fixed the camera
on a roller skate.

1070
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:14,220
I had a sort of sloping incline,

1071
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:17,500
all marked out in mm and cm.

1072
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:20,300
I moved it down,

1073
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:22,380
shot a frame,

1074
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:25,260
moved it lower,
and shot another.

1075
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:27,660
Then I had to move
my little man.

1076
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:30,380
You make him come down the steps

1077
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:33,380
and I'll move the camera down,
frame by frame.

1078
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:36,300
We're trying it out speeded up.

1079
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:38,420
I should finish up in close-up

1080
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:40,440
on the thief
hiding down the manhole.

1081
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:45,420
It should work,
except when it comes to it...

1082
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:49,120
It required great patience,
which I'd always had.

1083
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:55,480
Coming...

1084
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:02,280
You're always the first.

1085
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:09,420
- We don't see each other much.
- I don't have time.

1086
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:12,300
You have to finish your film...

1087
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:15,480
It's slowed up
since we've been dating.

1088
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:25,080
You remind me of the very pretty
Françoise Christophe.

1089
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:07,800
It's good.

1090
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:34,500
Last night was great.

1091
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:36,500
You're finally happy.

1092
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:40,320
You're learning a trade.
You're doing well at tech.

1093
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,340
You do your film.
You're calm.

1094
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:45,220
Everything's fine.

1095
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:47,220
I'm calm, but not happy.

1096
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:49,420
You don't understand anything!

1097
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,280
Look how calm I am!

1098
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:01,340
Manual workers

1099
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:03,420
only receive
a primary education,

1100
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:06,360
but know all about their trade.

1101
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:12,260
Manual workers are strong
with well-developed bodies.

1102
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:16,220
Second, intellectual workers,
bureaucrats for example,

1103
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:18,260
need exercise after work.

1104
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:22,360
Intellectuals are not as strong
as manual workers.

1105
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:26,340
To conclude,

1106
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:29,460
the manual worker
and the intellectual worker

1107
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:32,900
are totally different
from each other.

1108
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:34,140
Write it.

1109
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:36,120
MAN'S PRIDE
IS WORK WELL DONE

1110
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:39,360
I feel as flat as my little men.

1111
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:42,500
I've done my film,
now I'm lost.

1112
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:45,980
I was happy and sure of myself
making it.

1113
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:50,300
Now, there's only the tech,
the final exam in 2 or 3 months

1114
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:51,500
and then...

1115
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:54,400
I'm no longer even angry,
and that's scary.

1116
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:57,420
You're tired, it'll pass.

1117
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,500
Your film is splendid.

1118
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:02,580
Thanks,
but only you come up here.

1119
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:04,440
"Purse Snatcher" is good.

1120
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:08,640
It's not "Purse Snatcher,"
it's "Nocturnal Attack."

1121
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:15,420
I had to make films as I was
sick to death of the garage.

1122
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:20,280
He suggested I go see
Fernand Jean at the Apollo,

1123
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:22,700
to see what he thought.

1124
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:26,360
Remain confident.
I'll talk to Fernand Jean.

1125
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:30,420
So I went to the Apollo theater

1126
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:32,980
with my projector

1127
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,140
and showed the film

1128
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:37,220
from the Apollo's
projection room

1129
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:39,180
to the manager, who said,

1130
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:42,180
"It's good.
You ought to be making films."

1131
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:45,260
I told him my parents disagreed.

1132
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:48,260
Later, Christian-Jaque
came to Nantes

1133
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:51,260
to present his film
"D'homme à hommes."

1134
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:53,340
Where are you taking us?

1135
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:56,140
To see "D'homme à hommes."
You'll like it.

1136
01:50:56,160 --> 01:50:57,420
What's it about?

1137
01:50:57,440 --> 01:51:01,980
The founder of the Red Cross.
Christian-Jaque will be there.

1138
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,700
- We've seen several of his.
- He's made 40!

1139
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:06,140
OK, let's go.

1140
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:08,260
I'm going on my bike.

1141
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:10,140
At the intermission,

1142
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:13,340
Christian-Jaque was kind enough
to look at my film.

1143
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:15,420
He thought it wasn't bad.

1144
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:18,020
"You ought to make films,"
he said.

1145
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:20,340
Then my father said,

1146
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:23,460
"If you think the boy is good,

1147
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:26,260
"then he'll go to Paris."

1148
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:29,400
I left for Paris
the following October.

1149
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:03,420
First, I studied filmmaking,

1150
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:07,220
and I was out of work,
then a filmmaker.

1151
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:09,380
I met a woman filmmaker,

1152
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:12,140
we made a few films,

1153
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:14,260
then she gave me a fine son

1154
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:16,200
and now I paint.

1155
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:45,020
Devils and wonders,

1156
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:47,420
winds and tides,

1157
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:49,300
far away

1158
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:52,240
the sea has gone out.

1159
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:55,420
And you,
like a strand of seaweed

1160
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:59,220
gently caressed by the wind,

1161
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:01,260
you move as you dream

1162
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:03,320
in the sands of the bed.

1163
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:06,440
Devils and wonders,
winds and tides,

1164
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:11,320
far away the sea has gone out.

1165
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:15,340
But in your half-open eyes

1166
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:18,240
two tiny waves are still there.

1167
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:22,460
Devils and wonders,
winds and tides,

1168
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:25,260
two tiny tears,

1169
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:27,380
two tiny waves

1170
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:29,440
to drown myself in.

1171
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:57,400
