1
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,014
<i>I know the art
of evoking happy moments!</i>

2
00:01:57,171 --> 00:02:00,269
<i>Those scents, those unending kisses,</i>

3
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,350
<i>will they be born again
from that unfathomable abyss,</i>

4
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:05,559
<i>like a rejuvenated sun
rises in the heaven</i>

5
00:02:05,598 --> 00:02:07,521
<i>from the depths of the sea?</i>

6
00:02:07,643 --> 00:02:11,606
<i>O scents, O unending kisses!</i>

7
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:14,276
<i>The night was growing
dense like a wall</i>

8
00:02:14,777 --> 00:02:16,830
<i>and my eyes glimpsed yours
in the dark.</i>

9
00:02:16,863 --> 00:02:17,907
<i>And I drank your breath</i>

10
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,078
<i>O sweetness, O poison</i>-

11
00:02:21,035 --> 00:02:23,207
<i>and your feet fell asleep
in my brotherly hands.</i>

12
00:02:23,246 --> 00:02:25,383
<i>"The night was growing dense
like a wall."</i>

13
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:45,588
Is it over?

14
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:47,154
No, it's not.

15
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:48,363
Come, Jacquot, it's the end.

16
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,455
Sometimes it starts again.

17
00:02:51,283 --> 00:02:53,585
No, it doesn't. Let's go.
Papa's waiting...

18
00:02:54,454 --> 00:02:55,462
It's not finished...

19
00:02:57,499 --> 00:02:58,543
I'm staying.

20
00:05:28,905 --> 00:05:30,910
Show us yours, Jacquot.

21
00:05:33,077 --> 00:05:34,002
What, now?

22
00:05:34,078 --> 00:05:35,206
Don't you worry...

23
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,175
They do it later in the Army

24
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,345
to measure and compare,
so they know.

25
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,428
Know what?

26
00:05:42,547 --> 00:05:44,434
Look out, someone's coming!

27
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:47,683
Put it back.
It's nothing to write home about.

28
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:24,069
You three again!

29
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:29,277
Hello boy, homework done?

30
00:06:29,358 --> 00:06:31,411
That's right. Is it done?

31
00:06:31,486 --> 00:06:32,448
Not yet, Papa.

32
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:33,662
Do what your father says.

33
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,701
Hurry up, Madame Marilou...

34
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:39,750
5 litres exactly.

35
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:40,916
You're tops.

36
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:48,184
- Hurry! Only one side is curled...
- I'm coming!

37
00:06:48,216 --> 00:06:50,222
I'm on stage in an hour.

38
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,526
<i>Papa didn't want it,</i>

39
00:06:59,606 --> 00:07:00,650
<i>Mama neither.</i>

40
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:02,661
<i>Good little children</i>

41
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:03,909
<i>Obey their parents.</i>

42
00:07:12,122 --> 00:07:16,181
- That's in Act 2.
- Yes. It's the donkey duet.

43
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:19,343
The curler is too hot.

44
00:07:21,384 --> 00:07:23,556
Come down.
Stay away from that ladder.

45
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:25,561
Done your homework?

46
00:07:25,723 --> 00:07:27,859
I left my bag in the garage.

47
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:33,952
- It's fixed?
- Yes.

48
00:07:38,114 --> 00:07:40,369
It clunks when it's cold,
but that's normal.

49
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:42,288
Thanks.

50
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:27,310
Hello, Demy Garage here...

51
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,354
I want to order a new car.

52
00:08:29,431 --> 00:08:32,362
A black Citroén 7 CV.

53
00:08:33,436 --> 00:08:35,573
The customer's in a hurry.

54
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:44,875
Damn kids...

55
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:48,131
Always blocking the stairs.

56
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:54,389
Jacquot! I hate being late.

57
00:08:54,464 --> 00:08:56,386
I wanted an orange.

58
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:36,027
Goodnight, Papa.

59
00:09:38,062 --> 00:09:40,150
You should've come with us.

60
00:09:40,232 --> 00:09:41,442
I know "Les Saltimbanques"...

61
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:51,707
You know, the one Mama curls...

62
00:09:51,747 --> 00:09:56,968
<i>It is love
that consoles the poor...</i>

63
00:09:57,045 --> 00:09:58,932
In bed, "the poor".

64
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:07,317
"Say YOU!" prayers.

65
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:14,572
Our Father who art in Heaven...

66
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:22,001
They are good boys.

67
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:25,167
Hail Mary full of grace...

68
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:34,471
Coming to give us a kiss, Mama?

69
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:00,638
A rich labourer,
knowing his death was imminent,

70
00:11:01,504 --> 00:11:03,557
called his children in...

71
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:06,805
and addressed them without witness.

72
00:11:06,886 --> 00:11:09,936
Be sure not to sell
what is ours, he said.

73
00:11:10,057 --> 00:11:14,020
There is a treasure hidden within.

74
00:11:16,106 --> 00:11:18,326
<i>Jacques' childhood was his treasure</i>

75
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:21,415
<i>and</i> a <i>source of inspiration
for his films.</i>

76
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,500
Now then...

77
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:24,660
let me write.

78
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:31,757
<i>He was writing about his memories
and he talked about them a tot.</i>

79
00:11:31,835 --> 00:11:33,010
<i>Anecdotes came back,</i>

80
00:11:33,838 --> 00:11:34,882
<i>forgotten names</i>

81
00:11:34,964 --> 00:11:37,052
<i>and suddenly remembered details.</i>

82
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:42,315
<i>He spoke of the little kitchen,</i>

83
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:44,361
<i>the focus of family life.</i>

84
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:49,486
<i>And above all of his mother,</i>

85
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:51,661
<i>who was the life and soul of it.</i>

86
00:11:59,037 --> 00:12:03,049
<i>Do you remember our last date?</i>

87
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:11,597
<i>He liked remembering
Sunday outings,</i>

88
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,601
<i>when time passed slowly.</i>

89
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:17,732
<i>He had known what he called
"a happy childhood".</i>

90
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:43,897
<i>Jacques recalled
the arrival of a country cousin</i>

91
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:49,068
<i>that a Brazilian industrialist
had turned into an upmarket tart.</i>

92
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,148
Wait here.

93
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:55,156
Hey, good-looking,
is this Raymond's garage?

94
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:57,247
Raymond's my father.
What do you want?

95
00:12:57,321 --> 00:12:58,449
You don't know me,

96
00:12:58,531 --> 00:13:00,454
but I'm your aunt from Rio.

97
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,500
Papa!

98
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,632
Someone to see you, Boss.

99
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:06,752
That's him.

100
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:08,762
Oh, it's you.

101
00:13:08,836 --> 00:13:10,807
You look terrific.

102
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:14,973
Come and meet the wife.

103
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:21,281
It's that cousin I told you about,
who went off to Brazil.

104
00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:24,530
Don't touch, it's organza.

105
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,494
At last I know the whole family.

106
00:13:26,568 --> 00:13:29,701
I'll take you all
to La Cigale tonight.

107
00:13:30,865 --> 00:13:32,787
Come here, you.

108
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:34,832
You're invited too.

109
00:13:34,912 --> 00:13:36,918
Now I can kiss you...

110
00:13:40,044 --> 00:13:42,180
Oops! It's my lipstick.

111
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:46,470
Shall I sing you a song?

112
00:13:47,345 --> 00:13:48,472
For God's sake, don't get up.

113
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:50,643
Go on, sing Papa.

114
00:13:52,727 --> 00:13:54,815
You didn't miss our local wine?

115
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:57,944
Yes, I often think of "Gros Plant".

116
00:13:57,984 --> 00:14:01,117
One day a producer said
I ought to be in the movies.

117
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:04,124
So I did tests.

118
00:14:04,158 --> 00:14:07,125
But "Gros Plan" means "Close-up"...

119
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:11,420
I thought he was
offering white wine!

120
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,504
Let's drink to that!

121
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:15,633
Cheers!

122
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,771
Beautiful diamonds...

123
00:14:20,847 --> 00:14:22,899
Yes. So extravagant...

124
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:24,060
I've been spoiled too.

125
00:14:24,935 --> 00:14:26,146
You really shouldn't have...

126
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,191
Don't you criticise me...

127
00:14:29,274 --> 00:14:32,158
No, I'm pleased with my present.

128
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:35,458
I adore casinos,
particularly roulette...

129
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:39,454
I had a run of good luck.
I just kept on winning.

130
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:43,668
That means presents for everyone...
me too.

131
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:07,790
You came on your own?

132
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,833
I'm joining Bill Schuster in Munich.

133
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,876
He's the right sort.

134
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,180
First, I'd like to visit
Grandpa's grave.

135
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:20,220
I wasn't here when he passed on.

136
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:31,740
<i>I will wait for you</i>

137
00:15:32,815 --> 00:15:36,957
<i>night and day</i>

138
00:15:42,077 --> 00:15:45,175
<i>until your return...</i>

139
00:16:11,324 --> 00:16:14,422
<i>I'm the one who laughs...</i>

140
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:16,631
<i>Who wants to please...</i>

141
00:16:16,706 --> 00:16:17,750
<i>I'm Lola.</i>

142
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,901
That's my name.

143
00:17:10,734 --> 00:17:13,868
We gave you your Grandpa's name,

144
00:17:13,947 --> 00:17:16,083
but for me you're my little Jacquot.

145
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,504
<i>Seeing my name there
when I was so young</i>

146
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:28,600
<i>gave me a sense of the fragility
of our existence.</i>

147
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:47,374
Ah, how lucky I am!

148
00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:51,589
I saw a little old lady
and grabbed her handbag.

149
00:17:51,621 --> 00:17:54,671
I'm as slippery as an eel.

150
00:17:55,584 --> 00:17:57,886
- Guignol...!
- He's stolen a bag!

151
00:17:58,714 --> 00:17:59,806
I saw a policeman...

152
00:17:59,965 --> 00:18:02,018
so I've hidden it.

153
00:18:02,051 --> 00:18:03,974
Here he comes!

154
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:07,026
Good day, Guignol.

155
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:08,310
Good day, Gnafron.

156
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:11,232
Good day, Brigadier.

157
00:18:11,313 --> 00:18:13,401
I say, you wouldn't have seen

158
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:15,447
a suspicious individual?

159
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,615
A bag snatcher!

160
00:18:17,655 --> 00:18:19,577
Did any of you children

161
00:18:19,657 --> 00:18:20,832
see him around here?

162
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,918
He hid it under a bush!

163
00:18:27,918 --> 00:18:29,128
Are you doing that for Reine?

164
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,258
It still smells of coffee in here.

165
00:18:36,346 --> 00:18:38,399
What are you, a tortoise?

166
00:18:38,432 --> 00:18:40,438
None of your business.

167
00:18:40,476 --> 00:18:41,651
Can I keep this box?

168
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,613
Take it if you like.

169
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,860
I want to make a puppet theatre.

170
00:18:52,075 --> 00:18:55,089
What I hear about Munich's
not good.

171
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,292
I wonder about that cousin from Rio.

172
00:18:58,124 --> 00:19:02,348
Off to see her Mr Schuster...
Probably a spy.

173
00:19:02,463 --> 00:19:04,469
Yet she seemed sweet and kind.

174
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:09,853
How could anything go well?
Why go at all? And where?

175
00:19:10,724 --> 00:19:12,860
Madame de Saint-Clair is here.

176
00:19:16,064 --> 00:19:20,158
I feel like tapering it at the neck.

177
00:19:23,282 --> 00:19:24,326
Mr Cavalet is home.

178
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,337
Will that do?

179
00:19:26,453 --> 00:19:27,545
Almost...

180
00:19:28,372 --> 00:19:30,627
I'll just give it one last comb...

181
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,886
You made a Negro policeman?

182
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:37,933
No, I didn't.

183
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,890
Why's he black then?

184
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,065
The potatoes go black.

185
00:19:47,146 --> 00:19:48,190
I know...

186
00:19:48,398 --> 00:19:51,329
I'll make the heads
out of cardboard.

187
00:19:51,444 --> 00:19:53,496
Come along, everyone!

188
00:19:53,571 --> 00:19:55,577
Hurry up, please!

189
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:57,794
Next show in 15 minutes!

190
00:19:58,661 --> 00:19:59,753
Snow White is pretty.

191
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:02,877
I liked the witch.

192
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,881
I knew you would.

193
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:08,263
Grumpy's always grumpy.

194
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:10,225
He didn't stop sneezing.

195
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:12,224
That was Sneezy, dopey!

196
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:14,393
You must see the film.

197
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:16,526
It's terrific and scary.

198
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,571
My father promised to take me
if I get good marks.

199
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,659
I'm going again tomorrow.

200
00:20:22,693 --> 00:20:23,867
Me too. I'm going on Sunday.

201
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,908
Hello. I've seen it too.

202
00:20:26,948 --> 00:20:28,918
I like the witch best.

203
00:20:28,951 --> 00:20:31,039
He's got a crush on Snow White.

204
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,082
Don't say that.

205
00:20:32,205 --> 00:20:34,293
You said the other day
she was for you.

206
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,385
I didn't, but she's not bad.

207
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:39,517
She always sings
when she sweeps...

208
00:20:39,548 --> 00:20:41,518
when she washes up...

209
00:20:41,592 --> 00:20:44,559
and when she bakes cakes.

210
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:56,080
Mirror, mirror on the wall...

211
00:20:56,195 --> 00:21:00,419
<i>I met three lads from my hometown</i>

212
00:21:01,284 --> 00:21:03,337
<i>I was kissed by the youngest</i>

213
00:21:04,414 --> 00:21:06,466
<i>Who was also the handsomest</i>

214
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,512
<i>He took me to his room</i>

215
00:21:08,627 --> 00:21:10,715
<i>To talk of our hometown...</i>

216
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:24,153
<i>A whole bowl</i>

217
00:21:24,356 --> 00:21:26,409
<i>A whole bowl of milk</i>

218
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:28,448
<i>Nice and creamy</i>

219
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,624
<i>Nice and creamy, please</i>

220
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:35,621
<i>Some sifted sugar</i>

221
00:21:35,704 --> 00:21:37,840
<i>And then you mix</i>

222
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:40,880
<i>You mix it well</i>

223
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,178
Mama, they're outside!

224
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,569
Come see, there are giant dwarfs.

225
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,659
You've got them all, even Dopey.

226
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:01,871
A bit of chocolate?

227
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:03,834
Yes, please.

228
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,954
You're lucky to have them all.

229
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:09,165
Haven't you got Snow White?

230
00:22:09,248 --> 00:22:12,214
No, I don't care
two hoots about her.

231
00:22:12,294 --> 00:22:14,430
She can't do the splits.

232
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:16,350
I can.

233
00:22:17,383 --> 00:22:18,511
You try.

234
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:22,684
Go on, clumsy, try again.

235
00:22:24,685 --> 00:22:25,859
Push downwards...

236
00:22:25,895 --> 00:22:27,900
Stretch your legs...

237
00:22:28,022 --> 00:22:30,953
We could work up
an acrobatics act

238
00:22:31,026 --> 00:22:32,320
and tour the world in a circus.

239
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:34,032
If you like.

240
00:22:34,072 --> 00:22:35,164
Keep trying-

241
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,208
Push!

242
00:22:37,284 --> 00:22:40,382
Keep it rolling with your stick...

243
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:45,632
The Three Musketeers!

244
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:57,105
<i>I've got my Pal...</i>

245
00:22:57,185 --> 00:22:59,072
Pass me a spanner.

246
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:01,366
<i>Let me treat you
to a lakeside lunch...</i>

247
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:03,286
Can you manage?

248
00:23:05,363 --> 00:23:08,626
<i>Caroline, Caroline!</i>

249
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,750
<i>Put your best shoes on...</i>

250
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:16,880
It's war! Mobilisation!

251
00:23:17,962 --> 00:23:20,015
That's all what we needed!

252
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,102
God knows where I'll be sent.

253
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,309
You with your bad leg,
you'll stay here.

254
00:23:30,437 --> 00:23:33,653
Take those sacks to the cellars
for a shelter.

255
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:35,785
We need some in the attics too.

256
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:37,872
If my two sons go off to war...

257
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:39,958
They'll test gas masks
at school.

258
00:23:40,992 --> 00:23:42,963
Reine will look like a fly.

259
00:23:43,037 --> 00:23:44,045
Me. A fly?

260
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:47,088
You have a fly up your nose
and Jacquot too.

261
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:50,223
You'd be a beautiful fly.

262
00:23:52,507 --> 00:23:55,522
I've given him a big moustache.

263
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:06,911
Look, will that do you?

264
00:24:06,984 --> 00:24:08,028
Oh, yes.

265
00:24:09,154 --> 00:24:11,076
It fits.

266
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:19,551
She's the one with the hair.

267
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:24,808
- You don't hit puppets.
- Just a bit.

268
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:26,933
You think it's here?

269
00:24:28,888 --> 00:24:31,902
- Demy, Raymond Marcel?
- That's me.

270
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:34,064
It's your posting.

271
00:24:34,186 --> 00:24:36,275
The arsenal isn't very far.

272
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:39,280
I'll be home every night.

273
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:44,535
Better to make shells
than be hit by them.

274
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:49,669
Do you think they're asleep? Check.

275
00:24:52,752 --> 00:24:53,796
They're fine.

276
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:11,655
- Makes a change from a beret.
- Good luck, neighbour.

277
00:25:14,656 --> 00:25:15,830
Your lunch bag...

278
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:42,903
Grandma,

279
00:25:42,943 --> 00:25:45,031
can you make a cape
for my puppet?

280
00:25:45,112 --> 00:25:49,289
Not black like that,
but with this shiny cloth?

281
00:25:49,326 --> 00:25:52,376
Of course, Jacquot,
but I must finish this.

282
00:25:52,455 --> 00:25:54,461
Look at these pearls...

283
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:58,515
The woman's coming
for it tomorrow.

284
00:25:58,546 --> 00:26:00,552
Then you can do mine next.

285
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:06,015
Sing me another song.

286
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:07,976
I like your songs.

287
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:14,151
<i>There was a king</i>

288
00:26:14,275 --> 00:26:17,491
<i>who remained faithful</i>

289
00:26:18,405 --> 00:26:22,666
<i>to his beloved</i>

290
00:26:23,537 --> 00:26:25,839
<i>and left her a golden goblet...</i>

291
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,093
- Do you know about witches?
- Not really.

292
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,139
They fly on broomsticks.

293
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,225
Do they wear Japanese Kimonos?

294
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,316
You know all about costumes.

295
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:41,395
There's Grandma...

296
00:26:41,477 --> 00:26:42,486
and Jacquot!

297
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:48,616
<i>Four for Cinderella.</i>

298
00:26:48,695 --> 00:26:50,783
Coming, my little ones,
my elephants...

299
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,603
Coupons?

300
00:27:13,811 --> 00:27:15,698
150 francs. Fine.

301
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:36,641
In Germany
they've requisitioned cars.

302
00:27:36,716 --> 00:27:39,765
My husband wrote to hide ours.
I can't decide.

303
00:27:39,803 --> 00:27:41,773
- Where is he?
- The Maginot Line.

304
00:27:41,806 --> 00:27:43,858
Mine's busy making shells.

305
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:46,021
But he does get home every night.

306
00:28:04,752 --> 00:28:05,761
What is it?

307
00:28:05,837 --> 00:28:07,843
My guests haven't come.

308
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:08,843
Patience.

309
00:28:08,924 --> 00:28:09,933
Go look.

310
00:28:11,135 --> 00:28:13,141
Hang on, I've had an idea.

311
00:28:29,826 --> 00:28:31,963
Ready, children and elephants?

312
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:35,051
Off we go. Open the curtains.

313
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:37,095
And here is Cinderella.

314
00:28:37,211 --> 00:28:39,181
I'm so unhappy...

315
00:28:39,255 --> 00:28:42,305
My wicked sisters
have gone to the ball

316
00:28:42,343 --> 00:28:44,395
and I'm cleaning up the cinders.

317
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,432
Poor girl.

318
00:28:45,472 --> 00:28:46,433
Here I am.

319
00:28:46,557 --> 00:28:48,527
I am the Fairy.

320
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,613
The Lilac Fairy.

321
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,695
Want to go to the ball?
Just watch.

322
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,080
Don't forget to leave
at midnight.

323
00:29:01,117 --> 00:29:03,337
First, I'll change your dress.

324
00:29:04,163 --> 00:29:05,374
Here comes the stardust.

325
00:29:07,292 --> 00:29:09,380
That's not stars, it's sand.

326
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:10,589
You're lice-ridden!

327
00:29:11,464 --> 00:29:12,722
Look at the state of you!

328
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,808
Bend over the newspaper.

329
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:18,769
You know those Marchis kids
are full of lice.

330
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:22,023
They clapped, Mama,
and René and I bowed.

331
00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:24,991
They're everywhere.

332
00:29:25,065 --> 00:29:26,239
Let me see.

333
00:29:28,152 --> 00:29:30,288
You can't. They're too small.

334
00:29:30,364 --> 00:29:32,416
I'll put some lotion on later.

335
00:29:45,008 --> 00:29:48,105
- I've only got 1 left.
- I won these.

336
00:29:48,137 --> 00:29:50,059
- You stole them.
- Don't argue.

337
00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:52,145
Mind your own business, Demy.

338
00:29:52,184 --> 00:29:55,447
- Give them back.
- No, I won them. You're the cheat.

339
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,443
Don't argue.
We'd better go, or we'll be late.

340
00:30:00,486 --> 00:30:01,495
See you later.

341
00:30:05,868 --> 00:30:08,834
Look, Demy, a new poster!

342
00:30:08,872 --> 00:30:10,960
"Silence.
Enemy ears are listening."

343
00:30:12,001 --> 00:30:13,212
Are there enemies everywhere?

344
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,256
It's no joke...

345
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:19,353
Grandma and Mama read a book
called Mr Spy and His Daughter.

346
00:30:20,303 --> 00:30:22,523
The spies were disguised as nuns.

347
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:24,768
You had to check their shoes.

348
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:26,569
Hurry up. You m!

349
00:30:30,817 --> 00:30:32,823
Don't dawdle, Demy!

350
00:30:33,028 --> 00:30:34,999
- This OK?
- Fine.

351
00:30:35,114 --> 00:30:36,076
Mask on.

352
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:42,177
If there's a real alert,
I want no dawdling and no fuss.

353
00:30:45,503 --> 00:30:47,390
Nuns!

354
00:30:49,633 --> 00:30:51,556
Let's go check!

355
00:31:26,056 --> 00:31:27,230
Come with me to the toilet.

356
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:29,152
Can't you go on your own?

357
00:31:29,227 --> 00:31:30,354
I'm frightened.

358
00:31:41,826 --> 00:31:43,914
I'm going to explore the cave...

359
00:31:44,914 --> 00:31:47,085
There's a glow in the distance...

360
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:49,092
Jacquot, come back!

361
00:31:51,213 --> 00:31:53,266
It's as dark as Hell in there.

362
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:55,270
What's Hell?

363
00:32:29,722 --> 00:32:31,858
I want to go to the fair.

364
00:32:32,726 --> 00:32:33,984
It's for soldiers on leave.

365
00:32:34,854 --> 00:32:36,065
Let's go to the Guignol.

366
00:32:36,105 --> 00:32:38,158
We'll take a quick look first.

367
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,373
Hitler's head for 5 francs!

368
00:32:49,414 --> 00:32:51,586
- Now we go to the Guignol!
- Now?

369
00:32:52,543 --> 00:32:53,635
You're good, Father dear,

370
00:32:53,837 --> 00:32:55,723
but before I marry you,

371
00:32:55,797 --> 00:32:58,017
I want the skin of that old donkey.

372
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,018
My banker donkey? Never!

373
00:33:00,971 --> 00:33:03,024
I insist, Father dear.

374
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:05,187
I can't possibly refuse you.

375
00:33:05,268 --> 00:33:07,238
I say there!

376
00:33:08,314 --> 00:33:10,284
Kill my donkey

377
00:33:10,358 --> 00:33:12,411
and bring me his skin.

378
00:33:12,486 --> 00:33:13,655
They won't really kill it...

379
00:33:17,784 --> 00:33:18,793
How dreadful!

380
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,793
It's disgusting.

381
00:33:21,873 --> 00:33:25,053
Tell me, my fairy godmother,
what shall I do?

382
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,174
Disguise yourself...

383
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,186
You have bizarre ideas.

384
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:33,391
Come on, hurry.

385
00:33:39,688 --> 00:33:41,776
- Put this skin on.
- Awful!

386
00:33:41,816 --> 00:33:44,700
Just do as I tell you.

387
00:33:46,906 --> 00:33:50,169
From now on, we'll call you:
Donkey Skin.

388
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:22,412
Mama, there's no more school!

389
00:34:22,452 --> 00:34:24,339
Due to the war.

390
00:34:24,413 --> 00:34:25,457
Watch out.

391
00:34:30,713 --> 00:34:32,683
Is the garage Open?

392
00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:35,979
Not really...
Maybe the mechanic can help.

393
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:40,185
Can I have some water?

394
00:34:51,615 --> 00:34:52,742
Been on the road long?

395
00:34:53,576 --> 00:34:54,750
We've driven from Bruges.

396
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:57,751
Come in for a moment.

397
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:00,886
We ran for it.

398
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:05,143
People said they were raping women
and cutting off children's hands.

399
00:35:05,258 --> 00:35:07,346
We left in a panic.

400
00:35:11,391 --> 00:35:13,479
Too late, Madame Demy.
We're closing.

401
00:35:13,518 --> 00:35:15,489
For good?

402
00:35:15,563 --> 00:35:17,615
The Germans will soon be here.

403
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:19,619
They ransack. They kill.

404
00:35:19,693 --> 00:35:20,785
We're leaving.

405
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:22,784
All of you?

406
00:35:22,864 --> 00:35:24,917
We're going back to the farm.

407
00:35:26,035 --> 00:35:27,079
Are you off too?

408
00:35:27,161 --> 00:35:28,170
I don't know.

409
00:35:34,254 --> 00:35:35,465
Do you want to leave?

410
00:35:37,466 --> 00:35:38,641
I don't know.

411
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:48,908
The Germans are coming.
Are we going or not?

412
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:50,114
Where to...?

413
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:53,156
I can't leave Grandma.

414
00:36:15,182 --> 00:36:17,069
Can you help us?

415
00:36:17,143 --> 00:36:19,231
Lend us some civilian clothes.

416
00:36:19,271 --> 00:36:21,241
Sorry, we're leaving...

417
00:36:21,315 --> 00:36:22,359
Over here, boys!

418
00:36:27,656 --> 00:36:29,662
Get some overalls.

419
00:36:31,662 --> 00:36:33,798
We don't even know
if we're still at war.

420
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:45,142
Catch.

421
00:36:48,392 --> 00:36:49,353
Here.

422
00:36:49,435 --> 00:36:50,562
Thanks, boy.

423
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,297
- Isn't Reine here?
- No.

424
00:37:11,255 --> 00:37:13,308
She's staying with my sister.

425
00:37:13,466 --> 00:37:14,558
No news of your husband?

426
00:37:14,634 --> 00:37:16,474
I'm still waiting.

427
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:19,645
I worry, but I go to work.

428
00:37:29,988 --> 00:37:31,115
I'll translate for you...

429
00:37:42,712 --> 00:37:44,718
German's a weird language.

430
00:37:44,757 --> 00:37:47,855
Hush! Look at the poster...

431
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:55,112
You're taking them to the river'?

432
00:37:55,145 --> 00:37:58,160
Yes, I've got to pick up
some mattresses.

433
00:37:58,316 --> 00:38:00,286
They'll keep the girl company.

434
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,324
Don't let them swim on their own!

435
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,532
Don't you worry.

436
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:05,535
Off we go!

437
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:07,669
You get in here.

438
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:09,674
René, you climb in the back.

439
00:38:13,002 --> 00:38:15,090
She's a refugee,
from friends of friends.

440
00:38:15,964 --> 00:38:19,097
<i>She was a wonder
from Sainte-Geneviéve-des-Bois</i>

441
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:21,223
<i>and very pretty indeed.</i>

442
00:38:21,346 --> 00:38:22,355
No, not like that.

443
00:38:22,431 --> 00:38:24,318
Like this.

444
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:31,569
What's your name?

445
00:38:31,651 --> 00:38:34,749
Geneviéve from
Sainte-Geneviéve-des-Bois.

446
00:38:37,909 --> 00:38:39,997
You have to move your arms more.

447
00:39:06,113 --> 00:39:08,118
Shall we show her the stairs?

448
00:39:16,459 --> 00:39:18,596
Then, there's a little staircase.

449
00:39:18,712 --> 00:39:19,721
Coming?

450
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:33,198
You keep watch.

451
00:39:42,618 --> 00:39:44,541
My turn.

452
00:40:14,827 --> 00:40:16,880
The witch's door is open.

453
00:40:16,913 --> 00:40:19,001
Maybe it was burglars.

454
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,128
Let's look inside.

455
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:24,216
Can I see?

456
00:40:26,384 --> 00:40:27,476
Do you think she's dead?

457
00:40:44,115 --> 00:40:46,203
<i>It's him again.</i>

458
00:40:47,328 --> 00:40:49,333
<i>The metallurgist.</i>

459
00:40:50,373 --> 00:40:51,548
<i>It's him.</i>

460
00:40:54,587 --> 00:40:57,685
<i>It's wonderful.</i>

461
00:40:58,843 --> 00:41:02,806
<i>Hush, don't say a word.</i>

462
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,708
Don't worry.

463
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,843
It'll be fun.

464
00:41:25,794 --> 00:41:26,922
We won't be able to play cars.

465
00:41:27,004 --> 00:41:28,891
Then play cars now.

466
00:41:28,965 --> 00:41:30,009
Off we go!

467
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:36,227
We're going for a drive.

468
00:41:36,266 --> 00:41:38,272
Along the banks of the Loire.

469
00:41:38,311 --> 00:41:40,482
Careful. I can't swim.

470
00:41:50,952 --> 00:41:51,996
Put that down.

471
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:54,043
You mustn't touch everything.

472
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:56,087
They've got to have fun.

473
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:58,054
It's all new to them.

474
00:42:00,298 --> 00:42:02,303
What's this for?

475
00:42:02,342 --> 00:42:05,606
Pouring water on the grindstone
to sharpen the tools.

476
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:08,609
If you're thirsty, drink.

477
00:42:08,642 --> 00:42:10,730
I've brought their things.

478
00:42:12,689 --> 00:42:15,787
Old George told me
to take kids from Nantes.

479
00:42:16,861 --> 00:42:18,997
He told me the clog-maker
is a good man.

480
00:42:19,072 --> 00:42:20,200
Looks like he was right.

481
00:42:22,201 --> 00:42:23,293
They seem pale.

482
00:42:24,245 --> 00:42:26,298
The fresh air will do them good.

483
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:40,940
We don't see the war here.

484
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:43,023
Except there's no tobacco.

485
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:46,116
- I'll give you money.
- Later.

486
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:48,113
We'd better go.

487
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:50,289
I've never left them.

488
00:42:50,321 --> 00:42:52,493
Don't fret. We'll look after them.

489
00:42:58,624 --> 00:43:00,879
Come on.
Let's go feed the rabbits.

490
00:43:01,711 --> 00:43:03,799
I want to feed the rabbits too.

491
00:43:13,142 --> 00:43:15,314
- Bye, children.
- Bye.

492
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,179
You don't cut yourself
on that knife?

493
00:43:35,255 --> 00:43:38,352
I've been making clogs
for 30 years.

494
00:44:05,377 --> 00:44:07,383
Home we go, little fellow.

495
00:44:10,592 --> 00:44:11,636
<i>"My darlings,"</i>

496
00:44:11,677 --> 00:44:13,683
<i>"Here are some transfers"</i>

497
00:44:13,721 --> 00:44:16,819
"...and a badge
of the arms of Nantes,"

498
00:44:16,892 --> 00:44:19,028
"since you said you wanted a badge."

499
00:44:19,062 --> 00:44:21,032
"Say hello to Aunt Léa"

500
00:44:21,064 --> 00:44:22,108
"and the clog-maker."

501
00:44:22,274 --> 00:44:24,244
"Big kiss from Papa and Mama,"

502
00:44:24,277 --> 00:44:25,369
"Marilou."

503
00:44:36,584 --> 00:44:37,127
Not bad, huh?

504
00:44:37,836 --> 00:44:38,928
Your badge is great.

505
00:44:39,755 --> 00:44:41,808
They don't have them in the country.

506
00:44:41,883 --> 00:44:42,891
Where'd you get it?

507
00:44:42,968 --> 00:44:44,137
Little Demy... You've grown!

508
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,098
The country air has done you good.

509
00:44:46,222 --> 00:44:48,192
Here's the washing.

510
00:44:48,224 --> 00:44:50,361
Thank you.
Goodbye, Madame Le Dentec.

511
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,572
It's nice to have you back.

512
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:01,917
Jacquot,
take your beret off at table.

513
00:45:03,786 --> 00:45:06,967
I've made a real feast:
pasta with cheese and sausage,

514
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:09,011
from the sausage lady.

515
00:45:09,085 --> 00:45:11,257
- Luce, who sings in church?
- Yes.

516
00:45:12,172 --> 00:45:14,260
Glad to be home, boys?

517
00:45:15,176 --> 00:45:15,698
Yes, Papa.

518
00:45:16,428 --> 00:45:19,608
I want to go to the cinema
and the circus.

519
00:45:20,433 --> 00:45:21,893
I'll take you, or your father will.

520
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:23,730
All Papa likes is boules!

521
00:45:27,734 --> 00:45:29,822
It feels good. We're a family.

522
00:45:31,906 --> 00:45:35,004
Back to catechism class.
First Communion in May.

523
00:45:35,202 --> 00:45:36,211
Yes, Mama!

524
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:41,384
You're late...

525
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,549
Catechism went on for ever.

526
00:45:44,423 --> 00:45:47,556
I know. So I hope you pass
your First Communion test.

527
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:50,768
- Your sister passed first time.
- He knows.

528
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:53,814
He knows his catechism.
At least, I hope so.

529
00:46:01,111 --> 00:46:03,331
Can you help us fix up a trapeze?

530
00:46:03,364 --> 00:46:06,378
I'd better ask your Papa,
or you ask Guy.

531
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:10,713
This beam?

532
00:46:15,755 --> 00:46:17,927
"Lift up your souls,
yet remain modest",

533
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:20,014
as our priest says.

534
00:46:24,224 --> 00:46:26,277
- Missed!
- Your turn!

535
00:46:31,484 --> 00:46:33,454
You will do it, Robert?

536
00:46:33,528 --> 00:46:34,656
Yes, later.

537
00:46:39,911 --> 00:46:41,1000
Look at Reine's shutters.
Is she not back?

538
00:46:42,832 --> 00:46:45,965
We don't see much of her.
She's taken on airs.

539
00:46:47,046 --> 00:46:49,265
Feldkommandant Holt
was shot in the back.

540
00:46:50,133 --> 00:46:51,261
There's a curfew at 4 p.m.

541
00:46:52,386 --> 00:46:54,273
There'll be reprisals.

542
00:46:54,347 --> 00:46:56,353
It happened on Rue du Roi Albert.

543
00:46:56,433 --> 00:46:58,569
- On your way to catechism...
- Yes, that's it.

544
00:46:59,729 --> 00:47:03,740
<i>"Cowardly criminals
working for England and Moscow..."</i>

545
00:47:03,859 --> 00:47:07,871
"...shot the Nantes Feldkommandant
in the back..."

546
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,117
"on 20 October."

547
00:47:09,951 --> 00:47:12,039
<i>"The murderers have not been caught."</i>

548
00:47:12,245 --> 00:47:14,167
<i>"To punish this crime"</i>

549
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:17,470
<i>"I have ordered that
50 hostages be shot."</i>

550
00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:21,594
<i>"Due to the gravity of the crime,
50 more hostages..."</i>

551
00:47:22,467 --> 00:47:25,565
- 15 million for informers!
- More than Judas got.

552
00:47:25,638 --> 00:47:27,643
50 innocent people shot...?

553
00:47:27,724 --> 00:47:28,898
It's true. My father said so.

554
00:47:28,934 --> 00:47:29,942
The occupation:

555
00:47:30,936 --> 00:47:31,980
a quiet war.

556
00:47:32,021 --> 00:47:35,035
It's easy to lay down
the law with guns.

557
00:48:06,482 --> 00:48:08,405
We mustn't see German films.

558
00:48:08,568 --> 00:48:10,539
I know. My father told me.

559
00:48:10,613 --> 00:48:12,701
It looks terrific though.

560
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:14,661
And it's in colour.

561
00:48:14,743 --> 00:48:15,835
What a pity.

562
00:48:26,175 --> 00:48:27,267
Prévert wrote it.

563
00:48:27,301 --> 00:48:29,271
A sad love story.

564
00:48:30,347 --> 00:48:31,355
Let's see it.

565
00:48:38,774 --> 00:48:40,863
<i>Three for Les Visifeurs du Soir.</i>

566
00:48:55,421 --> 00:48:57,427
Gluttony is a sin, my boy,

567
00:48:57,465 --> 00:48:59,471
but it is your First Communion.

568
00:48:59,551 --> 00:49:01,604
Roast pork...

569
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:03,643
You've saved our bacon!

570
00:49:03,724 --> 00:49:05,812
If you put it there
it will get cooked.

571
00:49:05,893 --> 00:49:09,951
No, I'm using petrol.
That'll fool them at the checkpoint.

572
00:49:11,025 --> 00:49:12,995
- Thanks.
- See you tomorrow.

573
00:49:13,069 --> 00:49:15,289
I'll come early to help your wife.

574
00:49:17,241 --> 00:49:19,294
<i>Radio Paris lies...</i>

575
00:49:20,412 --> 00:49:22,548
<i>Radio Paris is German!</i>

576
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:26,597
We'll take the tape off the windows.

577
00:49:50,701 --> 00:49:53,716
We took the floor
and the sugar to the baker's.

578
00:49:53,872 --> 00:49:55,759
It's magnificent.

579
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:57,886
It's like before the war.

580
00:49:57,961 --> 00:49:59,135
A real tiered cake.

581
00:50:00,047 --> 00:50:01,091
It's been so long.

582
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:02,383
- I can't eat any more
- I can.

583
00:50:03,092 --> 00:50:05,229
Don't eat, Luce, sing.

584
00:50:06,305 --> 00:50:08,441
Sing us a song!

585
00:50:11,645 --> 00:50:15,823
<i>I laugh to see myself so lovely
in the mirror!</i>

586
00:50:22,993 --> 00:50:25,082
Let's sing another.

587
00:50:25,163 --> 00:50:27,085
<i>"Little Lison".</i>

588
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:31,214
It's going well.

589
00:50:31,254 --> 00:50:34,518
<i>She raises her bottom
like her mother</i>

590
00:50:34,592 --> 00:50:38,650
<i>And with her glass,
she says "Bottoms up!"</i>

591
00:50:45,022 --> 00:50:47,028
You're as handsome as a prince!

592
00:50:47,108 --> 00:50:49,114
What present did you get?

593
00:50:50,029 --> 00:50:51,073
A gramophone.

594
00:50:51,197 --> 00:50:52,205
Got any records?

595
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,201
Two.

596
00:50:53,325 --> 00:50:55,295
I can lend you some.

597
00:50:59,624 --> 00:51:01,677
Some water will do them good.

598
00:51:02,545 --> 00:51:03,803
No water!

599
00:51:04,714 --> 00:51:07,729
Water drinkers are nasty,
as was proved by the Flood.

600
00:51:22,529 --> 00:51:24,582
Listen to this, Guy.

601
00:51:25,491 --> 00:51:27,579
Music? Any time.

602
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:34,889
<i>The clock goes tick-took</i>

603
00:51:34,962 --> 00:51:37,098
<i>The birds go cheep-cheep</i>

604
00:51:37,132 --> 00:51:39,220
<i>The turkeys go gobble-gobble</i>

605
00:51:40,135 --> 00:51:42,307
<i>And the bell goes ding-dong...</i>

606
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:45,395
<i>But when my heart goes boom</i>

607
00:51:46,352 --> 00:51:47,563
<i>Everything else goes boom</i>

608
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,609
<i>As love wakes up.</i>

609
00:52:02,164 --> 00:52:04,134
I like ball bearings.

610
00:52:06,294 --> 00:52:07,386
It's terrific.

611
00:52:08,297 --> 00:52:10,517
You can see all the funnels.
You're lucky.

612
00:52:11,426 --> 00:52:13,479
You can look again if you like.

613
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,776
<i>Is it true you can</i> see <i>Le Normand/e?</i>

614
00:52:17,851 --> 00:52:18,860
Yes.

615
00:52:27,071 --> 00:52:28,246
Let me see.

616
00:52:35,416 --> 00:52:36,590
- I'll swap you.
- For what?

617
00:52:38,503 --> 00:52:39,677
Some ball bearings.

618
00:52:41,799 --> 00:52:42,891
Two sets.

619
00:52:43,885 --> 00:52:45,938
Yes. Bye.

620
00:52:58,487 --> 00:53:00,623
What you showed
Le Gerrec was film?

621
00:53:01,408 --> 00:53:02,452
Yes, movie film.

622
00:53:02,534 --> 00:53:04,754
- Where'd you find it?
- What'll you give me?

623
00:53:05,789 --> 00:53:07,759
- Ball bearings.
- No.

624
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:08,835
Two sets.

625
00:53:08,876 --> 00:53:11,012
I want the pencil-sharpener.

626
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:14,971
Then give me the film
and tell me where you found it.

627
00:53:20,224 --> 00:53:22,312
- <i>It's Le Normand/e?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

628
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:39,041
Watch out.

629
00:53:39,124 --> 00:53:42,138
Gypsies are dangerous.
You mustn't go near them.

630
00:53:42,169 --> 00:53:44,305
I don't care.
That's not why I came.

631
00:54:17,674 --> 00:54:19,893
Mine's got a plane.
I think it's a Messerschmitt.

632
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:22,939
- I've got a tank.
- It's German newsreel.

633
00:54:22,972 --> 00:54:25,987
We shouldn't have...
It must be forbidden.

634
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:28,231
Listen, we found it on a dump!

635
00:54:30,273 --> 00:54:33,288
- We ought to take it back...
- Don't be silly.

636
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,412
<i>These spoils of war,</i>

637
00:54:36,365 --> 00:54:39,628
a <i>few feet of real film,
eagerly brought home by Jacquot,</i>

638
00:54:39,661 --> 00:54:41,749
<i>had no time to become a fetish</i>

639
00:54:42,623 --> 00:54:44,676
<i>and catalyze his passion.</i>

640
00:54:44,751 --> 00:54:46,839
<i>Marilou swept them away as rubbish</i>

641
00:54:46,878 --> 00:54:49,050
<i>or as "compromising documents".</i>

642
00:54:49,924 --> 00:54:52,144
<i>Jacquofhad lost Le Normandie
for nothing.</i>

643
00:54:59,478 --> 00:55:00,522
Hey, Aunt Nique!

644
00:55:01,397 --> 00:55:03,617
Your stocking seam
looks like a snake!

645
00:55:07,697 --> 00:55:10,795
Since I am asked to justify myself,

646
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:14,007
Monsieur Pitou
loves Mademoiselle Clairette

647
00:55:14,122 --> 00:55:17,006
and she loves him too.

648
00:55:26,597 --> 00:55:28,602
<i>Yes, I tell you.</i>

649
00:55:28,641 --> 00:55:31,774
<i>It's for her that Monsieur is here.</i>

650
00:56:08,109 --> 00:56:09,284
It's cold.

651
00:56:14,534 --> 00:56:17,714
Those Krauts are ugly.
Jean Marais is handsome.

652
00:56:18,581 --> 00:56:20,717
4:15. What are they waiting for'?

653
00:56:20,751 --> 00:56:21,878
They like making us wait.

654
00:56:21,919 --> 00:56:23,889
They take their time.

655
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:28,055
Look: "Filming on a farm:
Jean Choux and his crew."

656
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:31,108
- Ducks too.
- Some crew!

657
00:56:31,306 --> 00:56:34,272
Jean Gourget's new film, Malaria,

658
00:56:34,352 --> 00:56:36,488
will take place
entirely in the tropics.

659
00:56:39,525 --> 00:56:40,534
About time.

660
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:44,752
"I want Malaria to have
<i>an</i> atmosphere of fear", he says.

661
00:56:44,782 --> 00:56:48,840
"Mireille Balin plays a colonial
wife suffering from malaria."

662
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:52,964
"Sessue Hayakawa
plays a native boy, a guitar player."

663
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:56,306
"Love erupts between
these two feverish beings."

664
00:57:00,344 --> 00:57:02,515
- Mireille Balin's beautiful!
- Beautiful?

665
00:57:02,555 --> 00:57:04,561
I know what I'm talking about.

666
00:57:04,683 --> 00:57:06,605
That one doesn't look bad.

667
00:57:06,685 --> 00:57:09,865
A guy falling from a tree.
There's blood everywhere!

668
00:57:22,331 --> 00:57:24,419
He's sweet.
He blows up my tires.

669
00:57:25,376 --> 00:57:26,551
Don't forget the valve.

670
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:31,761
You bike your mother around?

671
00:57:31,801 --> 00:57:35,813
No. She's a neighbour.
She's going for her coupons.

672
00:57:37,016 --> 00:57:39,069
Now you can go.

673
00:57:39,102 --> 00:57:41,986
I'm going out
to get some biscoffes.

674
00:57:43,108 --> 00:57:44,200
I'm scared.

675
00:57:44,234 --> 00:57:45,278
We've got a shelter.

676
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:47,366
- I want to go.
- We'll all go.

677
00:58:00,923 --> 00:58:02,928
What a racket. It's Hell.

678
00:58:03,009 --> 00:58:04,136
I'm frightened.

679
00:58:04,969 --> 00:58:06,144
I feel sick.

680
00:58:07,181 --> 00:58:09,186
It'll soon be over.

681
00:58:09,225 --> 00:58:11,278
Look how calm Jacquot is.

682
00:58:11,353 --> 00:58:14,319
Remember the cave
where it was as dark as Hell?

683
00:58:18,654 --> 00:58:19,746
I'm frightened.

684
00:58:25,955 --> 00:58:27,925
On September 16th, 1943

685
00:58:27,999 --> 00:58:32,224
I discovered the full horror
of violence and destruction.

686
00:58:34,174 --> 00:58:36,262
There were dead all over town,

687
00:58:36,302 --> 00:58:39,518
people screaming, and dying
beneath the rubble.

688
00:58:41,475 --> 00:58:43,528
It was the Apocalypse.

689
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:44,653
Ever since

690
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,658
I've hated violence.

691
00:59:22,195 --> 00:59:23,287
My city kids...

692
00:59:25,407 --> 00:59:27,413
I knew we'd see you.

693
00:59:27,577 --> 00:59:29,665
We thought we'd just turn up.

694
00:59:30,497 --> 00:59:32,669
There's no electricity.
It's all broken down.

695
00:59:32,709 --> 00:59:33,801
A total disaster.

696
00:59:34,628 --> 00:59:35,295
It was dreadful.

697
00:59:35,713 --> 00:59:36,757
We heard it here.

698
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:40,019
Come see the rabbits.
Remember the white one?

699
00:59:40,052 --> 00:59:41,060
Of course.

700
00:59:41,095 --> 00:59:45,188
It was all craters and smoke...
people looking for each other...

701
00:59:45,267 --> 00:59:47,189
I was in the street too.

702
00:59:47,228 --> 00:59:50,325
People were trapped.
I heard them shouting.

703
00:59:50,398 --> 00:59:52,451
- On your own?
- I was looking for Papa.

704
00:59:52,484 --> 00:59:55,665
I was fixing a car
on the Avenue des Américains.

705
00:59:55,739 --> 00:59:57,709
I got under it just in time.

706
00:59:57,741 --> 00:59:59,794
The Americans?
You brought them.

707
00:59:59,869 --> 01:00:00,961
Don't be stupid.

708
01:00:01,788 --> 01:00:04,043
It's hard to figure out:
our allies bombing Nantes.

709
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:06,967
Destroying Nantes, you mean.

710
01:00:07,045 --> 01:00:08,089
Filthy Germans!

711
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:09,222
It's all their fault.

712
01:00:09,298 --> 01:00:10,342
We're no trouble?

713
01:00:11,175 --> 01:00:13,347
None at all. We'll all squeeze in.

714
01:00:13,428 --> 01:00:15,315
I won't be here long.

715
01:00:15,389 --> 01:00:18,439
I'll go back to the garage
as soon as we get

716
01:00:18,477 --> 01:00:19,687
the electricity back.

717
01:00:20,688 --> 01:00:22,740
He always has his gramophone.

718
01:00:24,776 --> 01:00:25,987
<i>Hello, hello, James.</i>

719
01:00:26,821 --> 01:00:27,913
<i>What's new?</i>

720
01:00:27,989 --> 01:00:30,955
<i>Since my fortnight away?</i>

721
01:00:31,035 --> 01:00:34,132
<i>I'm calling you to discover</i>

722
01:00:34,164 --> 01:00:36,335
<i>What I'll find on my return...</i>

723
01:00:37,376 --> 01:00:40,474
<i>AH is well, Madame la Marquise.</i>

724
01:00:40,547 --> 01:00:42,683
<i>All is very well.</i>

725
01:00:43,593 --> 01:00:46,642
<i>But we must tell you</i>

726
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,813
<i>that there's been
a slight problem...</i>

727
01:01:11,671 --> 01:01:12,798
Come on. Inside.

728
01:01:20,057 --> 01:01:21,149
Come to bed, Jacquot.

729
01:01:21,225 --> 01:01:22,317
I'm sleepy.

730
01:01:23,144 --> 01:01:24,272
Go to sleep on your own.

731
01:01:24,354 --> 01:01:26,324
Under the covers, boy.

732
01:01:29,569 --> 01:01:31,657
Are your feet all right now?

733
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:33,011
Yes.

734
01:01:34,701 --> 01:01:36,706
You'll get used to them.

735
01:01:44,213 --> 01:01:46,301
Finishing your clog today?

736
01:01:54,643 --> 01:01:56,696
No, not that chisel.

737
01:01:57,731 --> 01:01:58,739
Here.

738
01:02:14,252 --> 01:02:17,516
I'm teaching you a trade,
but you'll never take it up.

739
01:02:17,548 --> 01:02:19,554
You'll have better to do.

740
01:02:19,634 --> 01:02:21,556
I'm going to make sets.

741
01:02:21,595 --> 01:02:22,639
Sets?

742
01:02:22,763 --> 01:02:24,851
Theatre and cinema sets,

743
01:02:25,767 --> 01:02:26,895
and puppet shows.

744
01:02:32,192 --> 01:02:34,198
Don't walk over the bridge
at Mauves!

745
01:02:42,539 --> 01:02:43,501
Missed!

746
01:02:52,886 --> 01:02:53,978
<i>After you,</i>

747
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:56,983
<i>I'll never</i>

748
01:02:57,016 --> 01:02:59,271
<i>love again...</i>

749
01:03:01,147 --> 01:03:02,321
<i>After you,</i>

750
01:03:02,398 --> 01:03:05,329
<i>my heart will be broken</i>

751
01:03:05,402 --> 01:03:07,622
<i>for ever...</i>

752
01:03:38,904 --> 01:03:42,915
Enough reading. Home we go.
We'll swap over.

753
01:04:00,849 --> 01:04:03,947
The past participle agrees with

754
01:04:04,771 --> 01:04:06,859
gender and plural of the complement

755
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:08,115
when it is placed before.

756
01:04:09,068 --> 01:04:10,196
For example:

757
01:04:11,071 --> 01:04:13,159
<i>la bille qu'il a prise est bleue.</i>

758
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,293
<i>What did he</i> take? <i>La bille.</i>

759
01:04:16,411 --> 01:04:17,503
Listen to me, boys.

760
01:04:18,414 --> 01:04:20,466
Things are getting hot up there.

761
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:22,761
Bille is feminine
and before the verb

762
01:04:23,587 --> 01:04:25,807
so the colour is feminine too.

763
01:04:27,968 --> 01:04:28,976
Don't be scared.

764
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:54,007
Every time I hesitate
over a past participle agreeing,

765
01:04:54,043 --> 01:04:57,141
I recall the school classroom
at Mauves

766
01:04:59,008 --> 01:05:01,144
and that parachute

767
01:05:01,178 --> 01:05:03,266
floating down over the Loire.

768
01:05:15,697 --> 01:05:16,824
A late visitor.

769
01:05:16,906 --> 01:05:18,034
Come in.

770
01:05:18,951 --> 01:05:20,125
"Un Visiteur du Soir".

771
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,173
Here's our neighbour.

772
01:05:26,294 --> 01:05:28,382
The Germans raided the café

773
01:05:28,463 --> 01:05:31,394
to get young men for forced labour.

774
01:05:31,425 --> 01:05:33,514
They took Gaston and Paul.

775
01:05:33,595 --> 01:05:36,609
The others
had made themselves scarce.

776
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:37,774
Damned Germans!

777
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,737
And Gilles too.

778
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:43,027
<i>Giiies and Dominique,
Dominique and Gilles...</i>

779
01:05:43,066 --> 01:05:45,118
No, they didn't take Dominique.

780
01:05:46,111 --> 01:05:48,199
<i>W's item Les Visiteurs du Soir.</i>

781
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:50,369
Films... That's all he thinks about.

782
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:52,329
You ought to go see

783
01:05:52,411 --> 01:05:55,377
the old Gallon sisters,
the teachers.

784
01:05:55,415 --> 01:05:58,548
They had a projector
and some Chaplin films.

785
01:05:58,627 --> 01:05:59,636
Some shorts.

786
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:00,632
Good idea.

787
01:06:00,713 --> 01:06:02,719
The boy's bored stiff.

788
01:06:06,846 --> 01:06:08,057
You'll be careful?

789
01:06:10,017 --> 01:06:11,109
Regularly and gently.

790
01:06:11,144 --> 01:06:13,315
Not too gently, fairly gently.

791
01:06:14,231 --> 01:06:16,284
Here are the films.

792
01:06:20,614 --> 01:06:22,703
You'll bring it back, won't you?

793
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:34,972
This country lettuce...

794
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:36,094
It's delicious.

795
01:06:36,135 --> 01:06:38,223
We eat it every day.

796
01:06:39,264 --> 01:06:41,352
- Pleased to see your parents?
- Yes.

797
01:06:43,394 --> 01:06:44,605
Papa gave me a present.

798
01:06:45,522 --> 01:06:47,528
Presents always work.

799
01:06:56,077 --> 01:06:58,130
- What do we do?
- Keep still.

800
01:07:16,938 --> 01:07:18,778
Your bicycle!

801
01:07:18,857 --> 01:07:19,984
Be quiet.

802
01:07:22,987 --> 01:07:25,123
Come in, it's all ready.

803
01:07:25,282 --> 01:07:28,166
Look, Mama, the projector.

804
01:07:28,327 --> 01:07:30,464
Don't touch.
I'm the projectionist.

805
01:07:30,497 --> 01:07:32,550
Look at the screen, Papa.

806
01:07:33,501 --> 01:07:35,471
Sit down.

807
01:07:37,715 --> 01:07:38,807
I've seen it.

808
01:07:43,931 --> 01:07:44,940
It doesn't work.

809
01:07:45,016 --> 01:07:46,986
Be patient. It will.

810
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:53,403
What is it?

811
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:57,376
Soap? It's bubble soup!

812
01:08:05,793 --> 01:08:07,799
<i>Jacquot was as delighted</i>

813
01:08:07,879 --> 01:08:10,015
<i>as if he'd made the film himself.</i>

814
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:13,057
<i>Happily showing films,
he ended his days</i>

815
01:08:13,094 --> 01:08:14,186
<i>at the clog-maker's.</i>

816
01:08:17,224 --> 01:08:19,313
<i>The Loire had become dangerous,</i>

817
01:08:19,394 --> 01:08:21,400
<i>with Americans on one bank,</i>

818
01:08:21,438 --> 01:08:23,526
<i>Germans
and the Resistance on the other.</i>

819
01:08:29,949 --> 01:08:31,872
<i>It was time to go home,</i>

820
01:08:32,035 --> 01:08:34,088
<i>back to the sand,
the long porch,</i>

821
01:08:34,956 --> 01:08:36,214
<i>and the garage courtyard.</i>

822
01:09:10,502 --> 01:09:12,674
<i>When we sing</i>

823
01:09:12,713 --> 01:09:15,680
<i>at cherry blossom time,</i>

824
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:17,765
<i>the nightingale</i>

825
01:09:17,845 --> 01:09:19,898
<i>and the mockingbirds</i>

826
01:09:19,973 --> 01:09:23,106
<i>all have a wonderful time...</i>

827
01:09:51,263 --> 01:09:54,230
<i>But it doesn't last for ever,</i>

828
01:09:54,309 --> 01:09:56,315
<i>cherry blossom time,</i>

829
01:09:56,353 --> 01:09:59,534
<i>when some people go</i>

830
01:09:59,608 --> 01:10:03,750
<i>to gather earrings in a dream...</i>

831
01:11:09,532 --> 01:11:11,620
The Americans are here!

832
01:11:17,751 --> 01:11:18,843
White wine, Raymond!

833
01:11:47,081 --> 01:11:49,003
Coming?

834
01:12:06,815 --> 01:12:08,868
It's Chopin. I recognise it.

835
01:12:10,945 --> 01:12:12,998
I like it here.

836
01:12:15,034 --> 01:12:17,170
Poor Chopin, all jazzed up.

837
01:12:23,378 --> 01:12:24,589
It sounds fine.

838
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:26,682
But it's written for the piano.

839
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,772
Thanks, I'll take it.

840
01:12:31,806 --> 01:12:32,850
O.K.

841
01:12:33,892 --> 01:12:35,143
I've been through this before,

842
01:12:35,978 --> 01:12:39,028
except the other was lent
and this is a gift.

843
01:12:39,065 --> 01:12:41,153
Don't thank me. It's worthless.

844
01:12:41,235 --> 01:12:43,323
Papa will buy an electric one.

845
01:12:43,362 --> 01:12:46,329
When you're fed up,
you can give it to me.

846
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:47,500
I'm yourjunk cousin.

847
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:49,540
Don't be silly!

848
01:12:50,622 --> 01:12:51,749
Bye, old man.

849
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:00,977
Where am I going
to put all my things?

850
01:13:01,052 --> 01:13:03,224
You need room for a cinema.

851
01:13:04,056 --> 01:13:05,183
You're not fair.

852
01:13:10,481 --> 01:13:13,579
I need cardboard boxes,
glue and fairy lights.

853
01:13:17,657 --> 01:13:19,663
Will you give me money?

854
01:13:40,604 --> 01:13:41,731
This Chaplin is funny.

855
01:13:41,772 --> 01:13:45,830
It's for you. I've seen it
forwards and backwards.

856
01:13:48,989 --> 01:13:51,161
Look at the screen:
pillars just like at the Olympic.

857
01:13:52,035 --> 01:13:55,168
He did it all himself
except for the curtain.

858
01:13:55,206 --> 01:13:57,259
Come have some coffee.

859
01:13:57,292 --> 01:13:59,298
Let him put it away.

860
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:01,472
I've only got one film.

861
01:14:01,506 --> 01:14:04,520
If only I could rub it out
and change it.

862
01:14:04,593 --> 01:14:05,637
Don't ask me.

863
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,725
You ought to buy me more.

864
01:14:07,764 --> 01:14:08,772
It's not the time.

865
01:14:10,893 --> 01:14:11,985
Will you fix my hairdo?

866
01:14:12,896 --> 01:14:13,988
I don't do hair any more.

867
01:14:14,022 --> 01:14:17,036
What with the boys
and the garage...

868
01:14:17,109 --> 01:14:19,245
I even do the book-keeping, look.

869
01:14:22,366 --> 01:14:24,454
Let's see your hair...

870
01:15:24,906 --> 01:15:25,950
What are you up to?

871
01:15:26,032 --> 01:15:28,204
I've had an idea
how to make a new film.

872
01:15:29,036 --> 01:15:31,089
The saucepan will poison us.

873
01:15:31,164 --> 01:15:33,300
Promise Mama
you'll rinse it well.

874
01:15:41,719 --> 01:15:44,734
- I can't wait to see Part Two.
- Me neither.

875
01:15:44,765 --> 01:15:47,945
I like her saying,
"a glimmer like everyone;"

876
01:15:48,895 --> 01:15:51,993
and talking about her mother,
who was a laundress.

877
01:15:52,025 --> 01:15:54,077
It's a fine love story.

878
01:15:56,197 --> 01:15:57,371
It's a masterpiece.

879
01:16:00,452 --> 01:16:02,540
You can't see.
You'll ruin your eyes.

880
01:16:27,529 --> 01:16:29,499
"The bridge at Mauves."

881
01:16:29,699 --> 01:16:31,787
You can see the crossbars.

882
01:16:31,826 --> 01:16:33,713
It was hard to draw.

883
01:16:33,787 --> 01:16:34,915
It's so tiny.

884
01:16:44,092 --> 01:16:47,226
Mama, it's serious.
It's a cartoon newsreel.

885
01:16:47,263 --> 01:16:48,307
It's very good.

886
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:50,561
"The planes are flying away."

887
01:16:55,649 --> 01:16:56,693
Did you like it?

888
01:16:57,735 --> 01:16:58,909
It was very good.

889
01:17:01,865 --> 01:17:03,123
Look, bras!

890
01:17:04,035 --> 01:17:07,168
- Straight to the ladies' unden/vear!
- Just looking.

891
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:08,250
Research.

892
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:10,261
The clean minds of today's youth...

893
01:17:10,335 --> 01:17:13,349
You make your own way home,
Jacquot.

894
01:17:14,465 --> 01:17:15,427
Come see.

895
01:17:15,508 --> 01:17:19,685
Women go into that shop
and then they disappear.

896
01:17:19,722 --> 01:17:20,731
Who told you?

897
01:17:20,807 --> 01:17:21,899
Someone. I just heard.

898
01:17:23,811 --> 01:17:25,816
- Those two?
- Hard to tell.

899
01:17:25,897 --> 01:17:27,949
- It's a fairy tale.
- No, a drama.

900
01:17:27,983 --> 01:17:32,207
They're sold as slaves
to harems in Argentina.

901
01:17:36,452 --> 01:17:38,422
Look, sheet music.

902
01:17:56,186 --> 01:17:58,239
Aunt Nique has the same.

903
01:17:59,399 --> 01:18:01,404
- What's what?
- Old junk...

904
01:18:01,526 --> 01:18:04,660
- Let's go.
- No. This shop's amazing.

905
01:18:16,004 --> 01:18:18,009
Something in particular?

906
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:19,134
No.

907
01:18:19,258 --> 01:18:23,435
Yes... What's that camera
with the handle in the window?

908
01:18:24,264 --> 01:18:25,475
A movie camera.

909
01:18:25,516 --> 01:18:26,560
For real films?

910
01:18:27,393 --> 01:18:28,604
9.5 mm. For amateurs.

911
01:18:29,563 --> 01:18:30,607
Does it work?

912
01:18:30,689 --> 01:18:31,781
If you put film in.

913
01:18:32,608 --> 01:18:34,745
I need it. I want to be an amateur.

914
01:18:34,778 --> 01:18:36,748
But I haven't any money.

915
01:18:36,822 --> 01:18:40,038
Have you nothing to swap?
Books or games?

916
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:47,171
Why are you rushing about?

917
01:18:47,253 --> 01:18:50,468
- He's got ants in his pants!
- He'll get over it.

918
01:18:50,507 --> 01:18:52,513
All right, Mr Dubuisson?

919
01:18:52,593 --> 01:18:54,645
We fill the tank. We have a chat.

920
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:56,261
I was looking for you...

921
01:19:57,177 --> 01:20:01,271
I didn't want you to go
knowing you were angry...

922
01:20:08,734 --> 01:20:10,656
<i>So I got the camera,</i>

923
01:20:10,736 --> 01:20:13,786
<i>but I had no idea how to use it.</i>

924
01:20:14,867 --> 01:20:18,047
<i>Luckily,
there was an instruction book.</i>

925
01:20:18,955 --> 01:20:22,219
<i>I was in a hurry to learn
all those barbaric terms</i>

926
01:20:22,293 --> 01:20:25,473
<i>like f-stop, orthochromatic film,</i>

927
01:20:26,298 --> 01:20:27,426
<i>panchromatic vision filter,</i>

928
01:20:27,466 --> 01:20:29,437
<i>film stock...</i>

929
01:20:29,469 --> 01:20:31,688
<i>As soon as I'd read it,
I decided I wanted</i>

930
01:20:31,722 --> 01:20:35,650
<i>to make the script
used as an example:</i>

931
01:20:35,727 --> 01:20:36,855
<i>"Solangds Adventure".</i>

932
01:20:36,937 --> 01:20:37,899
There you are.

933
01:20:37,938 --> 01:20:40,953
I've learned lots of words:
emulsion speed, f-stop,

934
01:20:41,026 --> 01:20:44,206
shutter, ortho, panchro,
depth of field.

935
01:20:44,238 --> 01:20:47,204
Good for you.
But it's all Chinese to me.

936
01:20:47,284 --> 01:20:50,334
What is it?
Is that what you learn at school?

937
01:20:51,289 --> 01:20:52,500
<i>"'" Solange's Adventure'. Actors:</i>

938
01:20:52,582 --> 01:20:54,670
<i>Solange (5),
her parents, a prowler."</i>

939
01:20:55,670 --> 01:20:56,631
Off we go.

940
01:20:56,713 --> 01:20:59,846
<i>"Despite being forbidden to,
Solange plays in the street."</i>

941
01:21:00,885 --> 01:21:03,935
<i>"A prowler promises her sweets
and kidnaps her."</i>

942
01:21:04,014 --> 01:21:06,945
Hey, I'm making a film.

943
01:21:07,018 --> 01:21:09,070
I need a big chap for the gypsy.

944
01:21:09,145 --> 01:21:11,151
Can you come Thursday
to the garage?

945
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:12,401
On Quai des Tanneurs?

946
01:21:13,234 --> 01:21:14,278
I know. I'll come.

947
01:21:17,615 --> 01:21:19,585
- I'll be home late.
- Don't worry.

948
01:21:19,659 --> 01:21:21,546
It'll be open.

949
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:23,875
"A gipsy makes her dance at fairs,"

950
01:21:24,707 --> 01:21:27,009
"but her mother recognises her
thanks to a locket."

951
01:21:27,836 --> 01:21:32,228
"This film for all the family
will have more appeal than a reel"

952
01:21:33,052 --> 01:21:36,232
"of some young star
pointlessly posing..."

953
01:21:36,264 --> 01:21:39,362
- You learn this at school?
- Yvon asked me that.

954
01:21:39,435 --> 01:21:40,527
That's my fur.

955
01:21:40,561 --> 01:21:43,445
- Will you lend it to me?
- What for?

956
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:45,737
For Yvon.
He's playing Solange's mother.

957
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:48,741
René's little brother is Solange.

958
01:21:48,822 --> 01:21:50,994
- What's all this?
- Watch your cocoa!

959
01:21:54,997 --> 01:21:58,212
- I don't like being a girl.
- I wouldn't mind!

960
01:21:58,251 --> 01:22:00,339
We need a dress, make-up,

961
01:22:01,213 --> 01:22:02,222
and a hat.

962
01:22:02,298 --> 01:22:04,351
I'll go to Madame Bredin's.

963
01:22:07,513 --> 01:22:09,601
- I've got it ready.
- Thanks.

964
01:22:11,685 --> 01:22:13,773
It's an old dress of Reine's.

965
01:22:18,069 --> 01:22:20,121
This circus of yours
is causing havoc.

966
01:22:20,196 --> 01:22:21,205
Stop making faces.

967
01:22:24,285 --> 01:22:25,377
You look pretty, Yvon.

968
01:22:26,288 --> 01:22:27,332
Come out.

969
01:22:28,457 --> 01:22:30,427
Yvon, explain to Solange

970
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:32,548
she mustn't go out alone.

971
01:22:32,587 --> 01:22:34,724
Now, walk slowly toward me.

972
01:22:41,975 --> 01:22:43,149
Good. That'll do.

973
01:22:44,102 --> 01:22:47,152
Here, Lorca,
I'll show you where to go.

974
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:48,364
You hide here.

975
01:22:49,192 --> 01:22:50,201
René...

976
01:22:50,277 --> 01:22:52,330
We'll do a full-face shot of him.

977
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:55,460
Solange, you play with your ball.

978
01:22:55,659 --> 01:22:56,621
Drop it...

979
01:22:57,495 --> 01:22:58,622
and turn right.

980
01:22:59,748 --> 01:23:01,836
You're the kidnapper! Look.

981
01:23:01,876 --> 01:23:05,887
"Soon after a
character offers her sweets,"

982
01:23:05,964 --> 01:23:08,017
"then wraps her in his cape."

983
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:10,138
So you stride after her

984
01:23:11,138 --> 01:23:13,143
and offer her sweets.

985
01:23:14,225 --> 01:23:17,323
- Do you like sweets, pretty girl?
- Yes, sir.

986
01:23:17,396 --> 01:23:18,440
Then you'll get some!

987
01:23:18,522 --> 01:23:19,650
Go on. Fight back!

988
01:23:38,214 --> 01:23:40,434
"Six months later."
Want to be older?

989
01:23:40,467 --> 01:23:42,354
No, it's for my film.

990
01:23:42,553 --> 01:23:44,690
Today, there's good news:

991
01:23:46,726 --> 01:23:48,731
Germany has surrendered.

992
01:24:21,145 --> 01:24:24,243
Belly-dancing means moving
your belly without moving your feet.

993
01:24:24,274 --> 01:24:27,241
You try. Move your head too.

994
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:29,373
Now we'll do it with the others.

995
01:24:38,752 --> 01:24:40,757
I'll place you with your drum.

996
01:24:40,796 --> 01:24:41,923
You, dance.

997
01:24:41,964 --> 01:24:44,017
You, beat time on the drum.

998
01:24:44,092 --> 01:24:46,098
We'll shoot. Get on with it.

999
01:24:46,178 --> 01:24:48,148
Bang harder, Lorca.

1000
01:24:51,435 --> 01:24:53,440
Then, the mother arrives.

1001
01:24:55,523 --> 01:24:56,567
Now, listen!

1002
01:24:56,608 --> 01:24:58,578
We move back.

1003
01:24:58,611 --> 01:24:59,655
You come forward.

1004
01:24:59,737 --> 01:25:02,752
When you see her dancing,
you say, "Hey!"

1005
01:25:02,783 --> 01:25:04,871
Not now. Move back!

1006
01:25:05,828 --> 01:25:06,956
When we shoot.

1007
01:25:07,956 --> 01:25:09,962
Recognise your daughter.

1008
01:25:10,084 --> 01:25:12,137
But that's Solange's locket!

1009
01:25:13,338 --> 01:25:15,261
Mama!

1010
01:25:24,811 --> 01:25:26,651
What are you doing?

1011
01:25:26,731 --> 01:25:29,911
I'm wrapping up my first takes

1012
01:25:29,943 --> 01:25:33,955
to send them to the Pathé Lab
at Joinville-le-Pont.

1013
01:25:54,892 --> 01:25:55,901
Nothing for me?

1014
01:25:55,977 --> 01:25:59,157
<i>Not today, my boy.</i>

1015
01:26:11,581 --> 01:26:15,758
<i>In the Far West, when night falls</i>

1016
01:26:15,794 --> 01:26:18,892
<i>Cowboys gather round the fire</i>

1017
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:24,186
<i>And sing an old song</i>

1018
01:26:24,264 --> 01:26:28,192
<i>About beautiful Texas...</i>

1019
01:26:30,313 --> 01:26:32,366
It's going to be a fine cardigan.

1020
01:26:32,441 --> 01:26:34,613
Knitting takes so long. Patience.

1021
01:26:34,652 --> 01:26:37,667
I'm the patient one.
I've been waiting two months.

1022
01:26:37,781 --> 01:26:40,879
The labs reopen,
but I still wait and wait.

1023
01:26:41,745 --> 01:26:42,956
It's no joke. I'm fed up.

1024
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:45,125
And you only knit for Papa!

1025
01:27:24,551 --> 01:27:27,684
<i>Then one fine day
the film arrived.</i>

1026
01:27:27,763 --> 01:27:29,733
<i>What excitement.</i>

1027
01:27:29,766 --> 01:27:32,981
<i>I loaded it on to my projector.
Not a thing.</i>

1028
01:27:33,062 --> 01:27:36,159
<i>It was absolutely,
totally transparent.</i>

1029
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:40,288
<i>I had forgotten
to adjust the f-stop.</i>

1030
01:27:42,407 --> 01:27:45,587
<i>If was clear
I had to learn the technique.</i>

1031
01:27:46,454 --> 01:27:46,996
What's wrong?

1032
01:27:47,497 --> 01:27:49,550
I want to go to film school.

1033
01:27:52,712 --> 01:27:54,800
We'll ask your father.

1034
01:27:54,882 --> 01:27:56,009
I know what he'll say:

1035
01:27:56,884 --> 01:28:00,065
"Are you crazy?
Thinking about films at your age!"

1036
01:28:04,311 --> 01:28:07,277
Learn a trade in a technical school.

1037
01:28:07,356 --> 01:28:09,362
You'll be a mechanic.

1038
01:28:09,568 --> 01:28:11,656
I want to go to high school.

1039
01:28:12,655 --> 01:28:15,621
Whoopee, veal with prunes!

1040
01:28:18,871 --> 01:28:20,842
I want to graduate.

1041
01:28:20,916 --> 01:28:24,131
Tech gives you a trade.
High school, nothing.

1042
01:28:32,556 --> 01:28:34,608
Set your minds to it for once.

1043
01:28:35,601 --> 01:28:37,654
Go on. Turn it.

1044
01:28:51,163 --> 01:28:53,216
If he picks on me again,
I'm off.

1045
01:28:53,249 --> 01:28:54,424
- Where to?
- Who cares?

1046
01:28:55,294 --> 01:28:57,513
Africa,
to teach mechanics to the Negroes.

1047
01:28:57,547 --> 01:29:00,644
That's it.
You clear off to Timbuktu!

1048
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:04,854
Me, I'd head for Paris.

1049
01:29:05,682 --> 01:29:07,902
I'll load crates
or be an extra at the Opera.

1050
01:29:07,977 --> 01:29:12,071
They'll take anyone.
One of my mother's clients told me.

1051
01:29:12,149 --> 01:29:16,160
You don't have to sing,
just hammer it out at the back.

1052
01:29:16,279 --> 01:29:19,294
I'll be all right at the Opera then!

1053
01:29:22,454 --> 01:29:25,634
<i>I won't spend my life teaching dance</i>

1054
01:29:25,708 --> 01:29:29,802
<i>I'll go to Pan's, take a chance</i>

1055
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:33,939
<i>Why teach pliés and entrechats</i>

1056
01:29:34,011 --> 01:29:37,109
<i>When I want to dance at the Opera?</i>

1057
01:29:37,223 --> 01:29:39,276
<i>We are a pair of twins</i>

1058
01:29:39,309 --> 01:29:41,362
<i>Born in the sign of Gemini...</i>

1059
01:29:55,956 --> 01:29:58,044
I absolutely must go to Paris.

1060
01:29:58,918 --> 01:30:00,176
I'm going too, but later.

1061
01:30:01,046 --> 01:30:03,099
Papa says I must finish tech.

1062
01:30:03,174 --> 01:30:04,301
Meanwhile, I make films.

1063
01:30:05,176 --> 01:30:05,698
With that?

1064
01:30:06,219 --> 01:30:07,228
As it happens,

1065
01:30:07,387 --> 01:30:11,481
I've had an idea for a film
and you'd be terrific in it.

1066
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:14,740
Are you kidding?
You and your camera are too small.

1067
01:30:14,772 --> 01:30:16,778
I've got big projects.

1068
01:30:18,819 --> 01:30:20,789
Remember my aunt from Rio,

1069
01:30:20,905 --> 01:30:22,875
how flirtatious she was?

1070
01:30:22,949 --> 01:30:26,213
She batted her eyelashes.
She was fun.

1071
01:30:26,245 --> 01:30:29,379
- It's a great role.
- Wasn't she the casino gambler'?

1072
01:30:30,251 --> 01:30:31,259
Yes, that's her.

1073
01:30:31,335 --> 01:30:34,350
With a scene
where you'd win lots of money.

1074
01:30:34,423 --> 01:30:35,467
Don't you want to?

1075
01:30:36,634 --> 01:30:39,565
Back to your dreams,
young Jacquot.

1076
01:30:39,721 --> 01:30:41,727
I've got my own.

1077
01:30:53,197 --> 01:30:54,289
How's it going?

1078
01:30:54,407 --> 01:30:56,413
I give up on actresses.

1079
01:30:59,414 --> 01:31:01,550
It's better to make cartoons.

1080
01:31:01,625 --> 01:31:04,639
The stars are cardboard
in cardboard sets.

1081
01:31:04,712 --> 01:31:06,682
I see. You want some cardboard?

1082
01:31:06,715 --> 01:31:08,886
- Can I have some?
- Of course you can.

1083
01:31:10,052 --> 01:31:12,023
Thanks, Mr Sweets.

1084
01:31:12,973 --> 01:31:15,061
Am I Mr Sweets for ever'?

1085
01:31:17,312 --> 01:31:19,318
Can I come back for more?

1086
01:31:19,398 --> 01:31:21,404
Whenever you like, boy.

1087
01:31:24,571 --> 01:31:27,704
<i>The boy had a project
and he needed space.</i>

1088
01:31:29,786 --> 01:31:34,047
<i>The attic next to the tires
was ideal and he made it his own.</i>

1089
01:31:38,005 --> 01:31:40,094
<i>A new life of peace and quiet began,</i>

1090
01:31:40,217 --> 01:31:42,269
<i>far from the noise of the tech,</i>

1091
01:31:42,303 --> 01:31:45,269
<i>a triﬂe less from
that of the garage.</i>

1092
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:07,343
What are you making?

1093
01:32:07,377 --> 01:32:09,383
- A ballerina.
- What's that?

1094
01:32:10,339 --> 01:32:11,514
A girl who dances.

1095
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:43,766
Look at her with that blonde wig.

1096
01:32:43,799 --> 01:32:44,761
Who?

1097
01:32:44,801 --> 01:32:46,972
Viviane Romance.
She was in Carmen.

1098
01:32:47,054 --> 01:32:49,106
We saw that. It was good.

1099
01:32:49,974 --> 01:32:52,027
- Nice costumes...
- Yes.

1100
01:32:52,102 --> 01:32:54,190
It's a film by Marcel L'Herbier,

1101
01:32:54,230 --> 01:32:56,200
so you know it's good.

1102
01:32:59,528 --> 01:33:00,537
Show me.

1103
01:33:00,613 --> 01:33:02,583
Otherwise I don't get it.

1104
01:33:02,657 --> 01:33:04,745
Come on then, I'll explain.

1105
01:33:05,661 --> 01:33:06,753
Look.

1106
01:33:10,876 --> 01:33:12,087
You have a nice setup.

1107
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:15,217
Don't touch. It's fragile.

1108
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:19,147
Not by the camera...
It's exactly in place.

1109
01:33:19,262 --> 01:33:21,315
If I want the little dancer to move,

1110
01:33:22,350 --> 01:33:24,486
I move her leg and shoot a frame.

1111
01:33:29,692 --> 01:33:30,820
Got it?

1112
01:33:31,778 --> 01:33:33,784
It's continuous movement.

1113
01:33:33,823 --> 01:33:35,911
If you film an arm...

1114
01:33:37,077 --> 01:33:40,008
you get continuous movement.

1115
01:33:40,164 --> 01:33:44,223
Now you can climb down.
I need all my concentration.

1116
01:34:05,113 --> 01:34:07,202
It's no damn good!
It's blurred, out of focus.

1117
01:34:07,325 --> 01:34:09,247
No good at all.

1118
01:34:15,502 --> 01:34:16,546
I've got patience.

1119
01:34:16,628 --> 01:34:19,678
If I had a new camera
I'd begin again.

1120
01:34:26,057 --> 01:34:28,110
It's nice being here with you.

1121
01:34:28,185 --> 01:34:30,273
I've been twice and talked to him.

1122
01:34:30,313 --> 01:34:32,319
He says it's a bargain.

1123
01:34:33,442 --> 01:34:35,412
It's that one.

1124
01:34:37,572 --> 01:34:39,578
It's more stable. Automatic

1125
01:34:39,658 --> 01:34:41,747
is better than cranking the handle.

1126
01:34:42,621 --> 01:34:43,748
If you say so.

1127
01:34:43,831 --> 01:34:44,839
Shall we go in?

1128
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:46,794
It's your present.

1129
01:34:46,834 --> 01:34:48,840
I'm glad I have you.

1130
01:34:49,004 --> 01:34:50,096
This camera,

1131
01:34:50,130 --> 01:34:53,097
an Ercsam Camex,

1132
01:34:54,052 --> 01:34:55,310
was the one I used.

1133
01:34:58,391 --> 01:35:00,479
It shot frame by frame.

1134
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:28,515
Car headlamps

1135
01:35:28,597 --> 01:35:31,647
are not the right thing
for lighting sets.

1136
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:33,732
We're a bit short.

1137
01:35:33,771 --> 01:35:34,945
People are paying late.

1138
01:35:35,773 --> 01:35:38,953
Your chum, Mr Debuisson
owes me <i>2</i> months.

1139
01:35:38,986 --> 01:35:40,160
He's talking to Mama.

1140
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:43,118
Hello, Mr Debuisson!

1141
01:35:50,584 --> 01:35:51,593
How's the tech?

1142
01:35:51,669 --> 01:35:53,721
My marks are O.K.,
but it's so dull.

1143
01:35:53,755 --> 01:35:54,799
Not again...

1144
01:35:55,632 --> 01:35:58,848
For an artist, it's hard
not getting your own way.

1145
01:35:58,887 --> 01:36:01,984
- You should see the attic.
- You've never seen it!

1146
01:36:02,016 --> 01:36:04,021
I can't stand heights!

1147
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:06,148
- Can I see?
- Of course.

1148
01:36:22,834 --> 01:36:25,006
The cartoon was terrific.

1149
01:36:25,046 --> 01:36:27,134
That's what I want to do.

1150
01:36:27,966 --> 01:36:29,058
I need equipment.

1151
01:36:29,134 --> 01:36:33,312
Christ on a bike!
Every Sunday the same thing:

1152
01:36:33,348 --> 01:36:36,481
"I don't want to be a mechanic.
I want to study film making."

1153
01:36:36,519 --> 01:36:40,482
We got him a camera.
Now he wants lights, a tripod...

1154
01:36:40,524 --> 01:36:41,698
God knows what else!

1155
01:36:42,568 --> 01:36:44,823
- Calm down, Raymond.
- I wish he would!

1156
01:36:57,379 --> 01:37:00,346
You're tough on Jacquot.
He works hard.

1157
01:37:00,425 --> 01:37:02,431
Let him have fun.

1158
01:37:03,637 --> 01:37:07,649
<i>A foreign girl arrived in Paris</i>

1159
01:37:07,726 --> 01:37:10,906
<i>Having crossed the globe</i>

1160
01:37:10,939 --> 01:37:14,950
<i>She settled in our fine country</i>

1161
01:37:15,027 --> 01:37:18,160
<i>But she had left
something behind in Chile</i>

1162
01:37:19,032 --> 01:37:22,332
<i>She had left something behind...</i>

1163
01:37:24,289 --> 01:37:27,505
And I forgot to buy
a Madeira cake.

1164
01:37:27,585 --> 01:37:29,721
I'm not a baby.
Cake won't work.

1165
01:37:30,547 --> 01:37:33,645
Sweet things never hurt grouches.

1166
01:37:33,718 --> 01:37:36,816
You've been sitting there
for an hour fuming with rage.

1167
01:37:36,847 --> 01:37:38,182
You know why?
Papa drives me mad.

1168
01:37:39,059 --> 01:37:44,114
Don't say that. It's a sin.
So is sulking.

1169
01:37:44,148 --> 01:37:46,201
Laugh, you clown.

1170
01:37:46,235 --> 01:37:48,406
Even if you're sad!

1171
01:37:49,322 --> 01:37:52,621
Ask your Papa to tell you what
happened when he came to Nantes

1172
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:54,712
from the country...

1173
01:37:55,705 --> 01:37:56,833
His "room in town"

1174
01:37:57,666 --> 01:37:59,838
in a drunk's house,
a Colonel's widow.

1175
01:38:02,923 --> 01:38:05,011
<i>Thank you, Guilbaud.</i>

1176
01:38:05,051 --> 01:38:09,145
<i>Have a drink with me.</i>

1177
01:38:09,223 --> 01:38:13,400
<i>I'm sure it'll cheer you up.</i>

1178
01:38:13,478 --> 01:38:15,484
<i>You've drunk enough tonight.</i>

1179
01:38:15,564 --> 01:38:18,698
<i>No? Too bad for you.</i>

1180
01:38:19,528 --> 01:38:21,830
<i>You're already drunk as a skunk.</i>

1181
01:38:22,699 --> 01:38:25,832
<i>The way you speak amuses me.</i>

1182
01:38:25,869 --> 01:38:27,958
<i>As drunk as a skunk, indeed!</i>

1183
01:38:28,957 --> 01:38:33,181
<i>I'll just drink to your health.</i>

1184
01:38:37,468 --> 01:38:39,474
And now the show begins...

1185
01:38:40,472 --> 01:38:41,564
Turn it on, Yvon.

1186
01:38:44,727 --> 01:38:47,855
His father agreed
to cut the door in half.

1187
01:38:47,856 --> 01:38:48,900
Why?

1188
01:38:49,817 --> 01:38:50,485
Projector noise.

1189
01:38:50,860 --> 01:38:52,948
The smallest cinema in the world.

1190
01:38:52,988 --> 01:38:54,199
I'm flattered to be invited.

1191
01:38:55,032 --> 01:38:56,326
You're our son's main supplier.

1192
01:38:57,118 --> 01:38:59,207
My supplier and friend.

1193
01:38:59,246 --> 01:39:02,296
Turn the light off, Yvon.
Open the curtains.

1194
01:39:04,420 --> 01:39:05,428
Screen!

1195
01:39:05,629 --> 01:39:06,722
Music!

1196
01:39:42,052 --> 01:39:43,060
Lights, Yvon.

1197
01:39:45,139 --> 01:39:47,192
Short, but very sweet!

1198
01:39:50,438 --> 01:39:52,408
Sailors are fun.

1199
01:39:55,486 --> 01:39:56,779
Mountain-climbing's great.

1200
01:39:57,614 --> 01:39:58,741
The mountain can wait.

1201
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:01,836
<i>You must see Beauty and the Beast.</i>

1202
01:40:01,911 --> 01:40:02,955
- Think so?
- You bet.

1203
01:40:03,038 --> 01:40:05,968
If you do, I'll go again with you.

1204
01:40:07,126 --> 01:40:11,220
You accept me if I draw,
but you never let me in your attic.

1205
01:40:12,174 --> 01:40:13,302
That's normal.

1206
01:40:13,468 --> 01:40:15,520
Demy, come tell us what to see.

1207
01:40:16,347 --> 01:40:17,521
He always knows.

1208
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:21,735
We must see...

1209
01:40:21,770 --> 01:40:24,868
Duvivier's <i>Unfel</i> Pére ef <i>Fils.</i>
It's good.

1210
01:40:25,859 --> 01:40:28,873
I've seen <i>Caprice</i>
with Daniéle Darrieux.

1211
01:40:28,946 --> 01:40:30,999
We know what you think of her.

1212
01:40:31,032 --> 01:40:32,124
Let's see.

1213
01:40:35,204 --> 01:40:36,248
Edith Piaf.

1214
01:40:36,331 --> 01:40:37,375
I adore her.

1215
01:40:37,457 --> 01:40:39,463
She sings really well.

1216
01:40:39,543 --> 01:40:41,631
I'm making a film in my attic.

1217
01:40:42,464 --> 01:40:45,811
A bag snatcher escaping
over the roofs of Paris.

1218
01:40:46,636 --> 01:40:49,852
It's called "Attaque Nocturne".
I'll be tied up for months.

1219
01:41:03,324 --> 01:41:04,499
<i>Four seasons had passed,</i>

1220
01:41:04,576 --> 01:41:06,498
<i>or a number, anyway...</i>

1221
01:41:06,537 --> 01:41:08,543
<i>Between fitting and welding,</i>

1222
01:41:08,623 --> 01:41:11,803
<i>Jacquofs French teacher
introduced him to classical music.</i>

1223
01:41:11,835 --> 01:41:14,802
<i>He bought a copy of this record,</i>

1224
01:41:14,881 --> 01:41:16,887
<i>but remained faithful to the Waltzes</i>

1225
01:41:17,050 --> 01:41:19,139
<i>which suited "Attaque Nocturne".</i>

1226
01:41:34,824 --> 01:41:36,746
<i>Jacquot had grown.</i>

1227
01:41:36,826 --> 01:41:38,796
<i>He had changed.</i>

1228
01:41:42,041 --> 01:41:45,008
<i>When he came down for meals,</i>

1229
01:41:45,087 --> 01:41:48,137
<i>he didn't say much,
which worried his mother.</i>

1230
01:41:52,388 --> 01:41:54,524
All right, Yvon, Jacquot's here.

1231
01:41:55,642 --> 01:41:59,784
<i>When his father
came up for a new tire,</i>

1232
01:42:00,691 --> 01:42:03,824
<i>he never looked at
the cardboard city his son lived in.</i>

1233
01:42:03,861 --> 01:42:06,033
<i>Yvon had become a sportsman.</i>

1234
01:42:07,032 --> 01:42:09,085
<i>Jacquot visited his grandmother</i>

1235
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:11,296
<i>and went to the cinema a lot...</i>

1236
01:42:11,329 --> 01:42:14,260
<i>or walked towards the port.</i>

1237
01:42:14,292 --> 01:42:16,380
<i>He was pulling at his moorings.</i>

1238
01:42:16,461 --> 01:42:18,633
<i>Jacquot was becoming Jacques.</i>

1239
01:42:20,592 --> 01:42:22,728
<i>He still complained about the tech.</i>

1240
01:42:24,805 --> 01:42:27,820
I hated that technical school.

1241
01:42:28,811 --> 01:42:31,944
Thumping my sheet metal
felt like hitting my father,

1242
01:42:31,981 --> 01:42:34,034
or letting off steam.

1243
01:42:34,193 --> 01:42:38,251
I had to get out of there,
find a solution.

1244
01:42:39,324 --> 01:42:42,540
While I made a mortise and tenon,

1245
01:42:43,496 --> 01:42:46,594
I was thinking of Hollywood.

1246
01:42:58,099 --> 01:43:00,354
Where's this going?
Round the client's neck?

1247
01:43:01,186 --> 01:43:02,313
Start again.

1248
01:43:02,438 --> 01:43:05,452
Fitting a tire
without the inner tube!

1249
01:43:05,525 --> 01:43:07,447
Hang on, I'll give you a hand.

1250
01:43:07,528 --> 01:43:09,616
It's not a champagne omelette.

1251
01:43:09,655 --> 01:43:10,747
What were you thinking of?

1252
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:12,744
Hollywood, of course!

1253
01:43:12,784 --> 01:43:14,755
Some mechanic...

1254
01:43:18,917 --> 01:43:20,970
Rita has a terrific figure.

1255
01:43:21,045 --> 01:43:22,089
She was a G.l. mascot.

1256
01:43:22,172 --> 01:43:23,299
They had her everywhere,

1257
01:43:24,133 --> 01:43:26,185
even on that awful Hiroshima bomb.

1258
01:43:26,385 --> 01:43:30,444
- You believe that?
- Yes, Rita was the bombshell.

1259
01:43:33,603 --> 01:43:34,731
We'll screen this film.

1260
01:43:35,564 --> 01:43:36,738
You'll see.

1261
01:43:37,650 --> 01:43:39,952
It's ages since I saw it,
it may be no good.

1262
01:43:40,821 --> 01:43:42,909
Let's take a look all the same.

1263
01:43:43,992 --> 01:43:46,128
- Can I switch it on?
- Wait...

1264
01:44:18,370 --> 01:44:20,625
This way, please.

1265
01:44:24,670 --> 01:44:26,806
I like the title:
"Le Port de I'Angoisse".

1266
01:44:26,839 --> 01:44:28,761
That's the French title.

1267
01:44:28,842 --> 01:44:33,019
Remember the scene where
Bogart picks his passengers up.

1268
01:44:33,097 --> 01:44:35,233
Yes, that's "day for night".

1269
01:44:35,267 --> 01:44:37,237
It was shot in daylight.

1270
01:44:37,311 --> 01:44:40,277
- And the moonlight?
- There isn't any.

1271
01:44:40,315 --> 01:44:43,495
It's the sun's reflection
through a red filter.

1272
01:44:43,569 --> 01:44:45,456
To shoot moonlight,

1273
01:44:45,488 --> 01:44:47,660
you need sunshine as backlighting

1274
01:44:47,741 --> 01:44:51,800
with, say, a reflection on water,
a shiny surface of some kind.

1275
01:44:51,872 --> 01:44:54,886
You need to have a precise angle

1276
01:44:54,959 --> 01:44:56,051
between the camera,

1277
01:44:56,085 --> 01:44:58,056
the backlit characters

1278
01:44:58,130 --> 01:44:59,257
and the sun.

1279
01:45:00,049 --> 01:45:01,093
How do you know?

1280
01:45:01,175 --> 01:45:02,184
I learnt it.

1281
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:26,335
That dress is too tight.

1282
01:45:27,209 --> 01:45:28,337
At least they can see!

1283
01:45:28,419 --> 01:45:31,599
It's nothing to be proud of.
What do I say to people?

1284
01:45:32,383 --> 01:45:35,563
Who to? Friends, neighbours?
It's none of their business.

1285
01:45:35,637 --> 01:45:36,764
You never tell me anything.

1286
01:45:36,805 --> 01:45:39,689
Make it up.
Say I'm getting married.

1287
01:45:39,767 --> 01:45:42,901
- A good idea.
- Then I'll go find me a husband.

1288
01:45:53,368 --> 01:45:55,374
- What a business.
- As you can see.

1289
01:45:55,580 --> 01:45:57,466
What are you going to do?

1290
01:45:57,540 --> 01:46:00,638
Me, nothing,
but my mother wants me married.

1291
01:46:00,753 --> 01:46:01,762
Who With?

1292
01:46:01,838 --> 01:46:02,846
I don't know.

1293
01:46:03,715 --> 01:46:05,803
I don't know anyone who wants to

1294
01:46:05,885 --> 01:46:07,890
and you're far too young.

1295
01:46:12,268 --> 01:46:13,277
Coming out?

1296
01:46:15,188 --> 01:46:17,443
I hate carnivals.
I'm going back upstairs.

1297
01:46:18,443 --> 01:46:19,451
Are you going?

1298
01:46:19,486 --> 01:46:22,452
I'm going with my chums
to see Mr Obligi.

1299
01:46:22,490 --> 01:46:23,664
He films for the news.

1300
01:46:23,699 --> 01:46:26,749
- You say that, then go dancing.
- No, I don't.

1301
01:46:28,956 --> 01:46:31,923
Come back
for my baby's christening!

1302
01:46:32,002 --> 01:46:34,055
I'll just take a look...

1303
01:46:50,651 --> 01:46:51,779
What's your name?

1304
01:46:51,861 --> 01:46:53,748
Josiane

1305
01:47:07,423 --> 01:47:09,595
<i>How silly these people are!</i>

1306
01:47:09,634 --> 01:47:11,687
<i>I hate carnival time.</i>

1307
01:47:12,555 --> 01:47:14,774
<i>Don't be so bitter, darling.</i>

1308
01:47:16,769 --> 01:47:19,024
<i>Look how big you are.</i>

1309
01:47:19,856 --> 01:47:24,033
<i>You carry it in front.
It'll be a boy, or twins.</i>

1310
01:47:24,070 --> 01:47:26,206
<i>No, everything's fine.</i>

1311
01:47:32,372 --> 01:47:33,500
I'm sick of operetta.

1312
01:47:34,458 --> 01:47:37,757
You see it all from one place.
At the movies, your eye moves.

1313
01:47:37,796 --> 01:47:41,759
You can see faces and details.
It's better.

1314
01:47:55,444 --> 01:47:56,536
Papa!

1315
01:47:57,363 --> 01:47:58,407
Papa. Quick!

1316
01:47:58,489 --> 01:47:59,617
My drawing teacher...

1317
01:47:59,699 --> 01:48:00,743
Hang on.

1318
01:48:01,577 --> 01:48:02,751
I told you, remember?

1319
01:48:02,787 --> 01:48:03,879
The one who likes me.

1320
01:48:05,749 --> 01:48:07,802
Let me finish.

1321
01:48:07,877 --> 01:48:09,929
I asked him to drop by.

1322
01:48:11,048 --> 01:48:12,092
He's with Mama.

1323
01:48:12,132 --> 01:48:13,176
Come talk to him.

1324
01:48:14,260 --> 01:48:18,318
It's not very reasonable
to think about the cinema.

1325
01:48:18,349 --> 01:48:20,520
He tinkers in the attic.
I've seen bits.

1326
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:21,568
He's gifted.

1327
01:48:21,603 --> 01:48:25,531
No doubt,
but the cinema is another world.

1328
01:48:25,566 --> 01:48:26,736
Many are called, few chosen.

1329
01:48:27,652 --> 01:48:30,750
I advise you to rid him
of his illusions.

1330
01:48:43,506 --> 01:48:46,390
- Has he gone?
- He was in a hurry.

1331
01:48:46,427 --> 01:48:47,471
Coffee, Raymond?

1332
01:48:47,595 --> 01:48:50,561
- Didn't he say anything?
- Not really.

1333
01:48:50,641 --> 01:48:52,860
Do you want coffee, or cocoa?

1334
01:48:52,894 --> 01:48:54,899
Why did he come then?

1335
01:48:54,938 --> 01:48:55,982
Come inside.

1336
01:49:29,191 --> 01:49:31,244
<i>There's no love, Héléne.</i>

1337
01:49:31,319 --> 01:49:33,407
<i>Only proof of love.</i>

1338
01:49:49,092 --> 01:49:51,228
<i>If life's mysteries</i>

1339
01:49:51,261 --> 01:49:53,267
<i>add up to nothing</i>

1340
01:49:53,389 --> 01:49:57,400
<i>Don't think, don't think
about it too much.</i>

1341
01:49:57,478 --> 01:50:01,702
<i>Why does the rain come from above?</i>

1342
01:50:02,609 --> 01:50:05,659
<i>Don't think, don't think
about it too much.</i>

1343
01:50:05,697 --> 01:50:09,957
<i>Why does the moon
have an influence</i>

1344
01:50:10,036 --> 01:50:15,127
<i>On the tides of the Seven Seas?</i>

1345
01:50:15,167 --> 01:50:19,428
<i>Why do peacocks go "Lee-co"
while cocks "Cockle-doo-doo"?</i>

1346
01:50:20,257 --> 01:50:23,437
<i>Don't think, don't think
about it too much.</i>

1347
01:50:26,557 --> 01:50:27,685
Everything O.K.?

1348
01:50:27,725 --> 01:50:30,775
- Yes, fine.
- What's this setup?

1349
01:50:31,772 --> 01:50:32,983
Roller-skating on the set?

1350
01:50:33,024 --> 01:50:36,038
To do voluptuous crane shots,

1351
01:50:36,111 --> 01:50:40,289
I had fixed the camera
on a roller skate.

1352
01:50:40,325 --> 01:50:43,209
I had a sort of sloping incline,

1353
01:50:43,287 --> 01:50:46,503
all marked out in millimetres
and centimetres.

1354
01:50:46,583 --> 01:50:49,514
I moved it down,

1355
01:50:49,545 --> 01:50:51,634
shot a frame,

1356
01:50:51,715 --> 01:50:53,685
moved it lower

1357
01:50:53,759 --> 01:50:54,851
and shot another.

1358
01:50:54,886 --> 01:50:56,938
Then I had to move my little man.

1359
01:50:57,013 --> 01:50:59,980
You make him come down the steps

1360
01:51:00,059 --> 01:51:03,109
and I'll move the camera down,
frame by frame.

1361
01:51:03,188 --> 01:51:06,155
We're trying it out speeded up.

1362
01:51:06,234 --> 01:51:08,405
I should finish up in close-up

1363
01:51:08,445 --> 01:51:10,533
on the thief
hiding down the manhole.

1364
01:51:12,534 --> 01:51:13,661
It ought to work,

1365
01:51:14,578 --> 01:51:15,670
except when it comes to it...

1366
01:51:15,746 --> 01:51:19,805
It required great patience,
but I had always had that.

1367
01:51:25,050 --> 01:51:26,224
Coming...

1368
01:51:31,308 --> 01:51:33,361
You're always the first.

1369
01:51:37,650 --> 01:51:40,747
- We don't see each other much.
- I don't have time.

1370
01:51:40,820 --> 01:51:43,751
You have to finish your film...

1371
01:51:43,824 --> 01:51:47,040
It's slowed up
since we've been going out.

1372
01:51:53,212 --> 01:51:55,383
You do look like
Frangoise Christophe.

1373
01:51:55,423 --> 01:51:57,310
I think you're very pretty.

1374
01:52:40,231 --> 01:52:41,323
It's good.

1375
01:53:07,350 --> 01:53:09,402
Last night was fun.

1376
01:53:09,477 --> 01:53:11,530
At last you're happy.

1377
01:53:11,564 --> 01:53:13,450
You're learning a trade.

1378
01:53:13,566 --> 01:53:15,572
You're doing well at tech.

1379
01:53:16,570 --> 01:53:18,658
You do your film. You're calm.

1380
01:53:18,740 --> 01:53:19,784
Everything's fine.

1381
01:53:20,742 --> 01:53:21,953
I'm calm but I'm not happy.

1382
01:53:22,828 --> 01:53:25,048
You understand nothing!
I've no choice.

1383
01:53:25,081 --> 01:53:27,051
Look how calm I am!

1384
01:53:36,387 --> 01:53:37,432
Manual workers

1385
01:53:37,514 --> 01:53:39,650
only receive a primary education,

1386
01:53:39,683 --> 01:53:42,781
but know all about their trade.

1387
01:53:43,772 --> 01:53:48,033
Manual workers are generally strong
with well-developed bodies.

1388
01:53:48,904 --> 01:53:52,251
Secondly, intellectual workers,
bureaucrats for example,

1389
01:53:53,034 --> 01:53:54,292
need exercise after work.

1390
01:53:55,162 --> 01:53:58,509
Intellectuals are not as strong
as manual workers.

1391
01:54:01,462 --> 01:54:02,673
To conclude,

1392
01:54:03,548 --> 01:54:06,681
the manual worker
and the intellectual worker

1393
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:09,976
are totally different
from each other.

1394
01:54:10,849 --> 01:54:11,893
Write it down.

1395
01:54:11,934 --> 01:54:13,939
<i>MAN'S PRIDE IS WORK WELL DONE</i>

1396
01:54:15,021 --> 01:54:17,157
I feel as flat as my little men.

1397
01:54:18,150 --> 01:54:20,370
Now I've done my film,
I'm at a loose end.

1398
01:54:20,403 --> 01:54:23,536
I was happy making it,
sure of myself.

1399
01:54:24,367 --> 01:54:25,578
Now, there's only the tech,

1400
01:54:26,411 --> 01:54:28,499
the final exam in <i>2</i> or 3 months

1401
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:29,755
and then...

1402
01:54:29,790 --> 01:54:32,840
I'm not even angry any more.
That's what's scary.

1403
01:54:33,962 --> 01:54:35,933
You're tired. It'll pass.

1404
01:54:36,007 --> 01:54:38,059
What I've seen of your film is ace.

1405
01:54:38,093 --> 01:54:41,191
That's what you say.
Only you come up here.

1406
01:54:42,098 --> 01:54:43,309
Your "Bag Snatcher" is good.

1407
01:54:44,184 --> 01:54:45,358
It's not "Bag Snatcher".

1408
01:54:45,436 --> 01:54:47,406
It's "Nocturnal Attack".

1409
01:54:49,441 --> 01:54:51,529
I said I had to make films

1410
01:54:51,569 --> 01:54:54,702
as I was sick
to death of the garage.

1411
01:54:54,781 --> 01:54:59,872
He kindly told me I should go see
Fernand Jean at the Apollo,

1412
01:55:00,956 --> 01:55:02,083
to find out what he thought.

1413
01:55:02,124 --> 01:55:03,964
Remain confident.

1414
01:55:04,127 --> 01:55:06,215
I'll talk to Fernand Jean.

1415
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:10,429
So I went to the Apollo cinema

1416
01:55:10,468 --> 01:55:12,556
with my projector

1417
01:55:13,514 --> 01:55:14,641
and showed the film

1418
01:55:15,433 --> 01:55:17,569
from the Apollo's projection room

1419
01:55:17,603 --> 01:55:18,777
to the manager who said,

1420
01:55:19,647 --> 01:55:21,949
"it's good.
You ought to be making films."

1421
01:55:22,776 --> 01:55:25,909
I told him
my parents didn't agree...

1422
01:55:25,988 --> 01:55:29,038
Later, Christian-Jaque
came to Nantes

1423
01:55:29,076 --> 01:55:32,174
<i>to present his</i> film
<i>Dfiomme a': hommes.</i>

1424
01:55:32,247 --> 01:55:34,335
Where are you taking us?

1425
01:55:34,374 --> 01:55:37,472
To see Dfiomme a': hommes.
You'll like it.

1426
01:55:37,545 --> 01:55:38,589
What's it about?

1427
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:41,561
The chap who founded the Red Cross

1428
01:55:41,592 --> 01:55:43,680
and Christian-Jaque will be there.

1429
01:55:43,762 --> 01:55:45,898
- We've seen several of his.
- He's made 40!

1430
01:55:45,931 --> 01:55:47,771
All right. Let's go.

1431
01:55:47,808 --> 01:55:48,983
I'm going on my bike.

1432
01:55:49,978 --> 01:55:51,105
At the intermission,

1433
01:55:51,939 --> 01:55:55,202
Christian-Jaque was kind enough
to look at my film.

1434
01:55:55,277 --> 01:55:58,243
He saw it and thought it wasn't bad.

1435
01:55:58,322 --> 01:56:00,328
"You ought to make films", he said.

1436
01:56:00,408 --> 01:56:02,461
And my father then said,

1437
01:56:02,536 --> 01:56:05,716
"Well, if you think the boy
can do any good,"

1438
01:56:05,748 --> 01:56:07,837
"then he'll go to Paris."

1439
01:56:08,669 --> 01:56:09,843
I left for Paris

1440
01:56:09,879 --> 01:56:11,932
the following October.

1441
01:56:44,257 --> 01:56:46,429
First, I studied film-making

1442
01:56:47,469 --> 01:56:51,433
and I was out of work,
then a filmmaker.

1443
01:56:51,475 --> 01:56:53,646
I met a woman filmmaker,

1444
01:56:53,728 --> 01:56:56,612
we made a few films,

1445
01:56:56,648 --> 01:56:58,784
then she gave me a fine son

1446
01:56:58,818 --> 01:57:00,788
and now I paint.

1447
01:57:28,064 --> 01:57:31,078
<i>Devils and wonders,</i>

1448
01:57:31,110 --> 01:57:33,281
<i>winds and tides,</i>

1449
01:57:33,362 --> 01:57:35,249
<i>far away</i>

1450
01:57:35,323 --> 01:57:38,421
<i>the sea has gone out.</i>

1451
01:57:39,454 --> 01:57:41,673
<i>And you, like a strand of seaweed</i>

1452
01:57:41,707 --> 01:57:45,670
<i>gently caressed by the wind,</i>

1453
01:57:45,712 --> 01:57:47,765
<i>you move as you dream</i>

1454
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:49,976
<i>in the sands of the bed.</i>

1455
01:57:50,969 --> 01:57:53,188
<i>Devils and wonders,
winds and tides,</i>

1456
01:57:55,057 --> 01:57:58,321
<i>far away the sea has gone out.</i>

1457
01:57:59,313 --> 01:58:02,363
<i>But in your half-open eyes</i>

1458
01:58:02,442 --> 01:58:05,492
<i>two tiny waves are still there.</i>

1459
01:58:06,572 --> 01:58:09,706
<i>Devils and wonders,
winds and tides,</i>

1460
01:58:09,868 --> 01:58:12,752
<i>two tiny tears,</i>

1461
01:58:12,831 --> 01:58:14,967
<i>two tiny waves</i>

1462
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,136
<i>to drown myself in.</i>
