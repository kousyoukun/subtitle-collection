1
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,043
- There she is. Hey.
- Hi, guys.

2
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,174
All right, baby girl. You go, baby girl.

3
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,218
You go, baby girl. You go, you go get it.

4
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,804
Yes!

5
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,843
You're my baby...

6
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,258
No, no, no, don't make it.

7
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:01,968
Damn it!

8
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,554
Yes!

9
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,147
- Nope. I absolute...
- I got this. I got this.

10
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,770
- I absolutely can't do it.
- Come on, Jess!

11
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,977
But remember, this is
a stupid frat boy ritual, so...

12
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,232
Yeah, but kick their ass!

13
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,529
- Yeah, fuck 'em up!
- Hey.

14
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,571
- We're together.
- No.

15
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,445
Cool, cool, cool.

16
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,319
Yes.

17
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,039
Yeah, go, Jess!

18
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:24,749
Dude!

19
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,577
Oh, God. Oh, God, Jess.

20
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,837
Only two cups left.

21
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,340
No, there's one cup.
You're just seeing double.

22
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,384
Oh, God! There's only one cups left.

23
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,302
- I can't do it. It's too much pressure.
- What?

24
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:38,800
- I can't do it, Jess.
- Look...

25
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,381
Look at me. Look at me.

26
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,558
You got us through the Wendy's drive-through

27
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,636
when my car had no windshield
and three tires.

28
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,096
You can do anything.

29
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,771
Yeah, but everybody's watching me,

30
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,815
and I'm sweating like crazy.

31
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,063
I look like a princess,
but I smell like a peasant.

32
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,441
Let's go, footjob girl!

33
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:58,195
Excuse me, she has a name! It's Alice.

34
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,995
And she's my best friend,
and she's good and kind.

35
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,287
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

36
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,578
Thank you,
but I did jerk off his roommate with my feet.

37
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,121
I know.

38
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,704
The key is, right foot
only for, like, a while.

39
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,711
- You know? Make him beg for...
- The left one. I know. Focus!

40
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:20,092
If we win this, we will be the only girls
to ever win the Halloween tournament.

41
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,384
We've got to do this.

42
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,600
For womankind.

43
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,063
Stop making me horny, and shoot!

44
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,205
We did it! We did it! We did it!

45
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,328
- I want up! I want up! I want up!
- You deserve it.

46
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,408
You've earned it.

47
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,957
Here we go. All right. All right, yes!

48
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,630
I'm the king of the world!

49
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:03,927
Again?

50
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,766
- Dude. Oh, God.
- Jess?

51
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:06,884
Are you all right?

52
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,812
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Dude. Come on. Come on.

53
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,936
- I'm fine, Mom.
- Oh, my God.

54
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,733
What happened?

55
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,230
Honestly, I don't even know
why we go to these stupid parties.

56
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,530
I just want to hang out with you guys.

57
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,902
- I know. I feel the same way.
- Yes!

58
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,655
Everyone else at this college
is sloppy and gross.

59
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,156
- Water.
- Wait, come here.

60
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,285
Not bad.

61
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,163
- Who's grosser?
- What is that?

62
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,330
- What is that?
- What's happening?

63
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,671
It's my vibrator,
it randomly turns on and off.

64
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,339
Oh, my God, you guys,
I'm gonna miss you so much next semester.

65
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,930
- I don't want to talk about it.
- It's sad.

66
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,223
- No, no, no, no.
- Dude,

67
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,392
Al Gore is guest-lecturing next semester.

68
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,344
Maybe you don't want to go to Australia.
I don't know.

69
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,522
- Yeah.
- On my 21st birthday, though,

70
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,224
my dad's getting us the chopper.

71
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,899
I said I don't want to talk about it.

72
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,397
So I don't know what's happening.

73
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,898
I don't even want to go. I just...

74
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,481
It was so hard to get into
the political science program.

75
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,033
And plus, my gym class
is bungee jumping, so...

76
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,405
Oh, my God, wear a good bra.

77
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,238
Well, look, we'll have
all of senior year together,

78
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,039
and then we'll have
the rest of our lives together, so it's fine.

79
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,913
- Yeah.
- You promise?

80
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:16,292
You guys, our kids are gonna play together.

81
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,247
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my gosh!

82
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,674
- We're so lucky!
- Get in here! Come here.

83
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,589
- Okay, that is a second vibrator.
- Yeah, I have a few.

84
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,889
Just... Just, yeah.

85
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,596
- No!
- Janine, no!

86
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,302
- No! No! No!
- Janine, get out!

87
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,887
- Come on.
- Janine!

88
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:33,971
Oh, my God! Stop!

89
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,647
- Bathroom is next-door!
- Cannot believe!

90
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,771
- Every damn weekend with this!
- Stop! She's already peeing.

91
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,022
Janine!

92
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,489
Hi. I'm Jessica Thayer,
and I'm running for state senate.

93
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,243
<i>Crime, underfunded schools, sewage.</i>

94
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,421
<i>These are real problems
that our community is facing.</i>

95
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:02,042
<i>Looking forward to your vote on November 3.</i>

96
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,967
<i>Thank you.</i>

97
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,426
- It's great.
- Well, 60% of the focus group

98
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,554
did say that it seemed
like you wouldn't put out.

99
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,227
What? Why are they being asked that?

100
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,805
Don't know, but 60% is, like, a lot.

101
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,894
- Yeah.
- We're still so close.

102
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,102
I don't understand,
Wesson literally tweeted out a dick pic.

103
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,152
He apologized.

104
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:25,027
Yes. He said, "I'm sorry, wrong dick pic,"

105
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,607
and then he tweeted out another one.

106
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,953
Look, if Wesson wins, he's literally
gonna cut every single program

107
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,530
that actually helps people.

108
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,115
We know that. Right?

109
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,709
But people want to vote
for someone they can relate to.

110
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,331
They feel safe with Wesson.

111
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,662
They want to have a beer with him.

112
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm not sure anyone
wants to have a beer with that.

113
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,181
Hey, Alice.

114
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:54,511
Hey. I am so excited for this trip.

115
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,891
I got my IUD taken out for Miami.

116
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,723
Is that a good idea?

117
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,729
<i>Yeah. It's your bachelorette weekend.</i>

118
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,685
Jess, Wesson tweeted out another dick pic,

119
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,611
and it's already got 10,000 retweets.

120
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,405
Alice, I got to call you back.

121
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,869
Tulum, give her back her Kindle!

122
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,451
Every fuckin' day.

123
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:23,043
- Hey.
- Hey.

124
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:26,342
I'm so sorry. I got stuck at the office.

125
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,964
It's okay.

126
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,890
- I got you chicken cashew nut, extra nut.
- No.

127
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,884
I ate an apple

128
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,221
and a bag of very, very
stale pretzels at the office.

129
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,227
It was so hard to get extra nut.

130
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,060
That woman is so mean.
She yells at me all the time.

131
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,894
She thought I hung up,
but I heard her call me a dipshit.

132
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,072
- How much did you tip?
- 20%.

133
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,151
- I know. I know, I know.
- Yeah. Like, I couldn't. I...

134
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,076
You're just such a good person.

135
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,912
It's Alice. I forgot to call her back.

136
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,662
- It's okay, get it.
- No. I can't, I can't, I can't.

137
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,960
Enough with my bachelorette itinerary.

138
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,582
Like, she's planned it to the half hour.

139
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,757
Yeah, I feel like this weekend
has come at the worst possible time.

140
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,084
I'm so stressed out.

141
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,885
You'll see your friends, you'll have fun.

142
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:10,961
It'll be restorative.

143
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,173
Like that time we took Xanax
and slept for 16 hours.

144
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,049
Oh, God, that was good.

145
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,846
You know, I love those girls,

146
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,145
but I really just don't want to
have a party weekend right now.

147
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,223
I want to have a weekend with you.

148
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,191
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

149
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,109
- You've been at the office, like, nonstop.
- I know.

150
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,027
Wait, wait, one... If we keep kissing,

151
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,486
I'm gonna want to have sex.

152
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:36,825
I'm okay with that.

153
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,281
- I'm down.
- Okay.

154
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,914
But I have, like, four things
I have to do before.

155
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,833
I just have to print out those itineraries
for the city council meeting.

156
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,789
And I have to email the <i>Herald.</i>

157
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:50,297
I have, like, a 25-minute-ish interview.

158
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,594
- Okay.
- I...

159
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,138
I tell you what,
I'm gonna let you do all that,

160
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,386
and I'm gonna go masturbate
in the shower and go to sleep.

161
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,138
- Really?
- Yeah.

162
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,558
- You're the best.
- Well...

163
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,061
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

164
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,020
- So, I texted you the address.
- Jess! Shots! Shots!

165
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,356
Shots, shots, shots, shots! Shots! Shots!

166
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,860
Shots, shots, shots!

167
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,077
Yay! Yes!

168
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,370
Oh, my God.

169
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,664
- What's on my head?
- This is it.

170
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,412
Your bachelorette weekend.

171
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,540
I have been waiting for this moment
since the first day of freshman year.

172
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,089
- Get in here.
- You have?

173
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,630
Oh, my God, there's gonna be
so many hot Miami babes.

174
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,586
We are gonna be swimmin' in dick, girl!

175
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,633
Hi, Alice.

176
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,347
- Peter. Hi.
- Hey.

177
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,050
And get out of here, she's mine now.

178
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,519
Don't get in too much trouble, okay?

179
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,973
- Yeah, I won't.
- Let's go, let's do it.

180
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,724
Drive safe.
Have fun at your bachelor party, okay?

181
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:47,899
Will do.

182
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,522
Hey, Alice, be careful swimming
in all that dick.

183
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,069
What are you? Okay, bye.

184
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,113
I'm so happy to see you.

185
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,908
This weekend's gonna be so much fun.

186
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,951
Can't wait to see my girls!

187
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,538
<i>When the pepper spray
hits your face, and it will,</i>

188
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,707
<i>keep your mouth closed tight.</i>

189
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,876
- <i>We are peaceful protestors.</i>
- Yes!

190
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,375
<i>Yet we fight, you know? Yet we are strong!</i>

191
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,956
- Yeah! Yeah!
- <i>This is war!</i>

192
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,841
<i>Okay, I got to head to a bachelorette.</i>

193
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,970
<i>But if anybody from the group disappears
from the protest,</i>

194
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,298
<i>you text my cell phone immediately.</i>

195
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,717
You have a cell phone?

196
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,303
- No.
- You're one of them!

197
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,813
I'll pick you up after school
on Monday, okay, sweetie?

198
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,392
Mommy, do you have to go to Miami?

199
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,106
Yes, I really do.

200
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,439
But I'm gonna miss you so much.

201
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,070
Technically, my time started 20 minutes ago,

202
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,994
so, going to note this
for the custody hearing.

203
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,031
I love you.

204
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,538
Bye.

205
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,051
Well, well, well.

206
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,228
Damn.

207
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,805
Damn.

208
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,139
How do you do it?

209
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,772
How do you look this
flawless getting off a plane?

210
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,269
It's honestly rude.

211
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,729
What, are you flirting with me?

212
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,857
I would not flirt with a happily
married woman who broke my heart.

213
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,785
Oh, my God, you broke up with me,
don't even start with that.

214
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,113
Excuse me,
now you are flirting with me, okay?

215
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,948
It's good to see you.

216
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,120
It's good to see you, too.

217
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,457
Girl, I have had a day.

218
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:34,086
First was full, I had to ride business.
It was disgusting.

219
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,260
- Gross.
- You're serious. Okay. Cool.

220
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:42,052
Oh, my God, did you hear
Alice is making us go to a foam party?

221
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,178
I know.

222
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,305
She has a scary amount of time on her hands.

223
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,933
Even though she's a full-time teacher,
I'm still like, "Get a job."

224
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,513
Do you have a job?

225
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,059
Activism is a full-time job, but...

226
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,147
Also no.

227
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,150
Look at them, the magic is still there.

228
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,356
- Hello!
- Hello!

229
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,071
- Hi!
- Hi! Yes! Yes!

230
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,163
- Oh, my God!
- It is all happening!

231
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,290
God, you smell so good.

232
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,208
I have, like, half a pound of weed in my bra.

233
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:14,501
- Hey, Alice, how's your mom?
- Well, Alzheimer's is tough, but she's good.

234
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,752
Good.

235
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,550
The Wallace 5th Floor Girls
are back together again!

236
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,384
God, when was the last time
we were all together?

237
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,964
I think it was two summers ago

238
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,765
when we came to visit you
in your tree, right?

239
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,977
No, no, no, 'cause Jess
couldn't make it, it was...

240
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,849
New Year's Eve, when Blair was in labor.

241
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,898
- Oh, my God. Crazy.
- God, that was three years ago, then.

242
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,816
Yeah. Well, we only have 55 hours,

243
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,646
so let's stop wasting our motherfucking time

244
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,772
and let's get the party started.

245
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,403
- Yes!
- Alice, you rock!

246
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,109
The party starts now.

247
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,122
Oh, my God. That was a bad idea.

248
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,121
- Yeah, we're in an airport.
- That was bad.

249
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,873
- That sounded like a gunshot.
- Yeah.

250
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:53,998
- Let's go.
- Yep.

251
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,296
- Sorry. Our bad.
- Sorry, everyone, bachelorette weekend.

252
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,967
I was never here! Never! Move!

253
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,853
- Nice Miami house, mami.
- Very nice.

254
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,980
We are supposed to pick up
the keys from the neighbors.

255
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,240
Did you bring a bathing suit?

256
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,533
- Hello?
- The beach is nice.

257
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:25,609
Hi.

258
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,444
Sorry, somebody left some keys for...

259
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,245
- Oh, my goodness.
- Sorry, we'll come back.

260
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,164
- So sorry.
- Hi, girls.

261
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,833
No, no, I'm sorry.

262
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,206
Let me put something on.

263
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,088
- Come on in.
- Very funny.

264
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,381
- Is it really?
- I love it.

265
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,958
- Hello.
- Hi.

266
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,918
- Thank you.
- Hi.

267
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,048
Okay.

268
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,261
What brings you to Miami?

269
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,677
Business? Pleasure?

270
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,467
The business of pleasure?

271
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,393
Bachelorette weekend.

272
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,015
Jess is getting married.

273
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,518
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

274
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,849
This marriage, will it be open?

275
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,109
You know, we haven't discussed it.

276
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,107
But, probably closed. Yeah.

277
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,984
Tightly, tightly closed.

278
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,782
Lea, does she not remind you

279
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,030
of our French girl from Turks and Caicos?

280
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,537
She does.

281
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,414
Thank you. Thanks.

282
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,038
Well, we're gonna try to keep it down.

283
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,041
Well, we'll try not to.

284
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,748
Yes!

285
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:21,878
- They're serious.
- Go. Go, go, downstairs.

286
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,426
She is delicious.

287
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,337
I want that.

288
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,559
Yes.

289
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,479
<i>Real World,</i> baby! Miami!

290
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,311
This house represents everything I hate.

291
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,983
I'm gonna go take a protest dump.

292
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,026
I call the room next to Jess!

293
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,862
I think that room has bunk beds,

294
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,064
so you're gonna have to share with Pippa.

295
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,527
Who that?

296
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,405
Pippa, my Australian friend
from semester abroad.

297
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,202
She's been CC'd on, like, every single email.

298
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,905
Right.

299
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,865
Well, if my snoring bothers her,
she can take the couch.

300
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,871
Or she can just start on the
couch and we'll go from there.

301
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,577
We'll figure it out.
She'll start on the couch.

302
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,087
- Blair.
- What?

303
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,338
Can you be careful with the red wine
on the white carpet, please?

304
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,544
My biggest and only donor

305
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,469
generously lent us this house
for the weekend.

306
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,257
- So, please be careful.
- Okay.

307
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,843
I'm telling you, she's got bigger problems
than a wine stain

308
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,428
if she wants to sell this place
for 3.4 in this market.

309
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,730
- How do you know that?
- Zillow.

310
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,899
- I Zillow everybody.
- Really?

311
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,102
Like, do you know how much my house is worth?

312
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,816
Okay, <i>atención.</i>

313
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,648
Bachelorette kit time.

314
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:28,945
Let me get your attention.

315
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,367
We got it all.

316
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,070
Bride-to-be bathrobe for our lovely Jess,

317
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:37,538
penis straws, penis sunglasses,
penis sprinkles, penis gum,

318
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,539
penis hats, penis pasta.

319
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,791
And yes, I did get a little
drunk and ate some of that dry.

320
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,374
- Don't judge.
- No judgment.

321
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,959
Also, I wrote you a card.
But don't read it now, read it later.

322
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,964
- Thanks, Alice.
- Yeah.

323
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,969
Shit. Frankie?

324
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,893
- Frankie?
- Frankie.

325
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,389
Oh, my God!

326
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,472
What?

327
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,397
- Oh, my God.
- Yes, mami.

328
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,146
Is that a sex swing?

329
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,398
Your donor is a freak, Jess.

330
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,195
Please. She rents this house out.

331
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,068
I'm sure somebody else
left it here accidentally.

332
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,741
And installed a load-bearing beam
to support it accidentally.

333
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,069
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, Jess.

334
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,744
I want to audition some dresses for tonight.

335
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,322
I brought 14. Come on!

336
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,252
Jess, if you are working,

337
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,205
- I'm gonna smack you in the face right now.
- I'm not. I'm not.

338
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,415
- One second.
- I'm gonna smack your face.

339
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,671
- Wait, wait, let me send it. Send, send, send.
- Put it down.

340
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,590
All right, come on, let's take a picture.

341
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,548
- Say, "Miami forever."
- Forever.

342
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,097
- You want us in the picture or not?
- Do you guys want us in the photo...

343
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,018
- We're here, too.
- Oh, my gosh, we both look killer in that.

344
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,095
Cool.

345
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,976
I'm so bummed I can't tag you
in this, on Facebook.

346
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,398
Why did you delete your account?

347
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,271
I had to. You were, you were tagging me

348
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,023
on things that could literally
ruin my career.

349
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,987
Yeah.

350
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,484
It's Pip! She's here!

351
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,612
- What? Who's that?
- Hi!

352
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:53,818
Pip!

353
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,033
Sorry.

354
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,159
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

355
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,499
Hello, hello, hello.

356
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,001
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

357
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,290
You're a goddess. You're literally a goddess.

358
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,591
- Guys...
- Hi.

359
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,543
This is Pippa.

360
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,969
- Hello.
- The famous...

361
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,887
Frankie, Blair, Alice.

362
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,218
Hey, what's up?

363
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,551
My God, you guys are meeting
for the first time, this is so exciting.

364
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,180
- I know.
- Nice to meet you.

365
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:23,981
This is so weird, you guys,
because it's sort of like

366
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,683
you're all Jess's best friends,
I'm Jess's best friend.

367
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:30,612
And so it's sort of like
we're all already best friends, you know?

368
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,031
Well, it's a little different for us,
sorry to interrupt,

369
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,985
but Jess and I were freshman year roommates,

370
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,865
so it's kind of like family.

371
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,828
- I know, I know.
- Okay, I'm going to grab a chair.

372
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,204
Feel free to gel.

373
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,081
Just gonna sit on my suitcase here.

374
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,204
I'm famished.

375
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,210
- Do you want my leftovers?
- Oh, shoot. We just finished.

376
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,882
No, I was gonna wrap that up
and take it to go.

377
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,425
I think we're done. Check, please!

378
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,722
It's okay. I'm just gonna take
some of this bread from the bread basket.

379
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,390
When you got bread and Vegemite,
you got yourself a meal.

380
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,968
What? Vegemite?

381
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:03,304
They should call you cuckoos
instead of Kiwis.

382
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,513
Am I right?

383
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:05,723
- Alice.
- Oh, my God.

384
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,227
That's funny on several levels,

385
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,436
because I'm actually Australian
and a Kiwi is a New Zealander.

386
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,488
There's nothing wrong with being a Kiwi,
we all love Kiwis,

387
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,692
but, it's sort of like calling
a Chinese person Japanese.

388
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,527
It's just sort of like, little bit racist

389
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,409
to not recognize the cultural
differences there, you know?

390
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:22,615
Oh, my gosh.

391
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,787
Eat me out. It's a fruit, Kiwi.

392
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,622
I'll take it.

393
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,252
Pippa, what do you do?

394
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,336
Well, singer-songwriter is the dream.

395
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,257
Party clown is the reality.

396
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,636
Check. Just, anyone, a check.

397
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,346
A chair.

398
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,048
A chair.

399
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,258
Right.

400
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,145
I'm so excited to see you. It's been so long.

401
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,893
- Tell me everything.
- I'm dying.

402
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,316
The flight was literally amazoir.

403
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,024
It's toast, toast time.

404
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,824
Raise your glasses, Jess.

405
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,152
Gosh, I can't believe you're getting married.

406
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,909
Feels like just yesterday you were showing me

407
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,787
how to hide that cat scratch on my face
with that cover-up.

408
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,117
I remember that.

409
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,918
And even though we don't
get to see you all the time

410
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:12,043
because you're so busy
with Peter and the campaign

411
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:15,217
and changing your Brita filters
or whatever it is you white people do,

412
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,005
I love you, and you're my best friend.

413
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,179
To me and Jess.

414
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,053
- Be-cheers.
- Cheers. Again.

415
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,354
I love you, Alice. Thank you.

416
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,644
Three toasts is the limit tonight, though.
You're cut off.

417
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:30,941
If you're gonna do another one, do it now,

418
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,108
'cause I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

419
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,277
- Do you want to come?
- Why would I come with you?

420
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,355
It's a heteronormative thing that girls do.

421
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,945
Okay, guys, no one responded to my emails

422
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,742
about which club we were gonna go to,

423
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,946
so I printed out the top 10
according to Yelp.

424
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,283
I have my personal favorite,
but I don't want to sway anyone, so...

425
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,208
- Is it the one that's circled in big red?
- Yeah.

426
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:53,918
I was kind of hoping that we
could make it an early night.

427
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,917
Yeah, right. What?

428
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,344
- That doesn't feel right.
- No, I'm just so exhausted.

429
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,637
I mean, I've been so overworked...

430
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,680
No, not gonna happen, baby girl, all right?

431
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:06,636
'Cause this is the biggest weekend
of our lives, all right?

432
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,183
Girls, girls.

433
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,935
Hi. I just got some coke from the busboy.

434
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,274
- You fucking what?
- What?

435
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,817
America. Already?

436
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,644
Sort of right on the nose.

437
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,479
Yes, okay, now we're talking.

438
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,734
Now, okay, I'm in. I'm in.

439
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,737
Okay, guys, I can't do any cocaine.

440
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,113
I'm running for office.

441
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,786
What? No one's gonna find out
you did a little coke...

442
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,159
- Stop.
- Did a little coke at your bachelorette.

443
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,333
I haven't really done drugs
myself since I sort of...

444
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,537
I smoked this bit of shoji root

445
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,965
on an excursion in the desert, and I died.

446
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,043
Anyway, I'm very jet-lagged,

447
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,594
so I will do cocaine, yes.

448
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,593
- So everyone's in? Yep?
- Dope, dope, dope.

449
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,595
You guys, hold on. I don't know.

450
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,974
Stop being a stupid fucking cunt
and do a little fucking cocaine!

451
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,474
Jesus, Frankie.

452
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,727
Sorry, I did a little bit of it.

453
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,643
Jess.

454
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,062
It would mean...

455
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,065
Yeah.

456
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,075
It would mean so much to me,

457
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,868
if we could do a little bit
of cocaine together.

458
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,711
So disgusting!

459
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,129
- Let me get a little more.
- Yep.

460
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,425
Before, I was very tired,
and now I'm sort of very awake.

461
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,510
That's the cocaine.

462
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,803
- I figured.
- Yeah.

463
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,131
I love this. I love Miami!

464
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,511
- Yeah, girl!
- Miami!

465
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,306
Okay, now put on these fucking sashes.

466
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,023
- Thank you!
- All right.

467
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,148
Oh, my God!

468
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,983
Yes, yes, yes!

469
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,319
- Oh, my God!
- No, no, no.

470
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,824
Man, it smells like barf over here.

471
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,622
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- God!

472
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,068
I'm getting us drinks.

473
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,985
You guys, you guys,

474
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,945
let's get Jess a stripper!

475
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,996
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

476
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,164
Right?

477
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:19,541
You guys, you guys, you guys,
male or female, though?

478
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,713
Male. I'm thinking male for her.

479
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,086
- Yeah.
- Okay, I got it.

480
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,461
Frankie, do you have a tampon?

481
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:28,921
- I need one.
- Yup.

482
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,676
- Thank you.
- Got one. Here we go.

483
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,725
What day of your flow are you on?

484
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:36,098
No, no. It's our code.

485
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,271
In college, we would
ask each other for tampons

486
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:41,312
if some guy was skeezing us out
and we wanted to be saved.

487
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,189
You just say "tampon," and they run.

488
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,770
Oh, my God, I love that.

489
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:48,198
I used to use tampons,
but now I use David cups.

490
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,776
- You mean DivaCups.
- No, no, David.

491
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,990
They were designed by my neighbor, David,

492
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,697
to collect blood for an art
installation he's doing.

493
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,953
Let's stop talking about periods now.

494
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,288
Cool.

495
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:03,167
<i>All right, everybody, we have a special
request from a Caucasian named</i>

496
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:04,589
<i>Alice!</i>

497
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,334
That's me. I'm Caucasian Alice.

498
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,215
<i>Bring all your girls up here. Grab 'em.</i>

499
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,796
Jess, come on. Come on.

500
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,133
Give her the drinks. Go on.
Girls, get up there.

501
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:17,811
We won the talent show freshman year
with this little routine.

502
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,480
Might want to stand back.
No, physically, get back!

503
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,190
Okay.

504
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,393
If you didn't go to college with us,
you're not in the routine.

505
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,567
Okay, get into places.

506
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,829
Yeah!

507
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,636
You're doing so good!

508
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:07,944
These are my new friends.

509
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,111
Jess, Jess, Jess!

510
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,364
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

511
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,617
Are you okay? You all right?

512
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,957
Did anybody see me fall?

513
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,705
- Everybody saw. Everybody saw.
- No. Well, yeah.

514
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,287
- Alice! You fell!
- Yeah.

515
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,623
It was be-gorgeous!

516
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,003
Jess, you were supposed to catch me.

517
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:32,131
You know, I forgot that one part.
I'm so sorry.

518
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,507
It's a pretty important part!

519
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,972
Would some more cocaine make you feel better?

520
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,175
Yes!

521
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:47,108
This Montepulciano is majestic
and rebellious.

522
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,353
Tell me, what are you tasting?

523
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,275
Pepper.

524
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:52,526
Pass. I need more time.

525
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,274
Forest floor.

526
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,359
Licorice.

527
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,617
- There's a nostalgia to it, you know?
- Yes.

528
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,073
You are all correct!

529
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,667
- Yes!
- I need more time.

530
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,501
It's Jess.

531
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,049
- Take it.
- Okay. Hello.

532
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:15,629
I'm drunk! I lost two credit cards already.

533
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,134
<i>Oh, no. Okay.</i>

534
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,887
- Well, it's getting pretty wild over here, too.
- <i>Really?</i>

535
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,014
I'm getting, like, a light beeswax.

536
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,595
I like that.

537
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:26,849
Jess, guy says that we can drive his Lambo.

538
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,150
- Babe, I got to go.
- <i>All right.</i>

539
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,272
Call me when you're home safe.

540
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,445
- I will. I love you.
- <i>Love you, too.</i>

541
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:33,689
Get off the phone.

542
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,195
Are we ready to get crazy?

543
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,276
- Yeah.
- Sure.

544
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:41,868
This Lambrusco is served...

545
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:43,994
Chilled!

546
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:50,876
Do you guys remember Michelle?

547
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,754
Michelle, she was obsessed with Nickelback.

548
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,429
Beauty, Jess!

549
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,223
- I know what this soiree needs.
- What?

550
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,471
Pizza!

551
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,889
Yeah!

552
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,391
- Pizza! Pizza!
- Yes, yes, yes.

553
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,269
- Yes!
- Nice! Sweet!

554
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,600
Okay, I love her.

555
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,059
- Right?
- Yes.

556
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,645
She is... Be-mazing?
I don't know how she would say it,

557
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:14,855
but she is incredible!

558
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,531
I am telling you, she is one of us.

559
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,701
- She is so free-spirited.
- Totally.

560
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,782
- I just... I love her.
- I don't know about that.

561
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,534
- I totally feel it.
- Do you guys feel like

562
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:26,332
she's here on a work visa,

563
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,206
or, like, a tourist visa or, like, illegally?

564
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,250
- Like, what's her deal?
- What, dude?

565
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,172
- She's here for a bachelorette party.
- That is crazy.

566
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,583
- Build a wall.
- I just, like, don't...

567
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,133
I don't want to do anything illegal tonight.

568
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,502
- What?
- You don't?

569
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,212
You just snorted a mound of cocaine.

570
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,390
- Simultaneously.
- That was, like, in the name of Jess.

571
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,012
That was, like, for Jess.

572
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,765
- Don't put that on me.
- Check you out.

573
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:46,970
You're literally cuckoo.

574
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,555
I'm just, like, voicing
what some people are thinking,

575
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,936
- you know what I mean?
- Do you have snags?

576
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,895
Okay, no snags.

577
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:58,106
This is a pizza shop, yeah?

578
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,736
God, it is so warm.

579
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,489
You guys have to get in.

580
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,031
I am coming.

581
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,738
I am gonna warn you now.

582
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:09,452
Did not have time to self-wax,
so it is like a jungle down there.

583
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:10,877
- Self-wax?
- Yeah.

584
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,455
Like, with those weird little,
like, paper strips?

585
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:14,915
Yikes, dude.

586
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,466
Even I'm like, "Yikes, dude."

587
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:20,967
Look, you guys, I don't understand.
Why all the hate?

588
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,889
Okay, I got it, I got it.

589
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,387
- Well, that was fast.
- But, seriously,

590
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,343
we're gonna talk about
this self-wax thing later.

591
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,553
Okay, come on.

592
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,768
- Hey...
- Oh, not bad.

593
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,695
Stripper's here!

594
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,148
- You guys!
- Yes!

595
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,232
I don't want a stripper!

596
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:42,821
Did you bring a CD or anything?

597
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,952
Like, <i>Now That's What I Call Music!</i>
or anything?

598
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,946
- No. No, I didn't.
- No? It's all right.

599
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,576
I got some pretty filthy music on my phone.

600
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,533
- I'll hook you up.
- Thanks.

601
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,206
- Hey.
- Hi.

602
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:56,085
Hey, I got to take a piss.

603
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,291
Oh, yeah, there's a bathroom down there.

604
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,088
All right.

605
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,178
It's, like, down there.

606
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,723
I bet he's going to fluff his junk!

607
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,971
Let's give him room, let's make a stage, yes.

608
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,677
You guys, I don't want a stripper.

609
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,387
I think he looks like he's on something.

610
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,939
He's definitely on something.
Like bath salts.

611
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,188
Oh, my God, he's gonna eat our faces.

612
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:19,271
- Oh, God, he would!
- This vintage remote is so confusing.

613
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,357
- I've never even had a striptease. I mean...
- Nope.

614
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,532
Well, there was that one time.

615
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,030
Yes!

616
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,577
Maybe somebody else should go.

617
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,871
- Stripper. Stripper, stripper.
- So, this is Jess,

618
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,449
the bride-to-be, your subject, okay?

619
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,081
And lucky for you, so lucky,

620
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,958
you get to do whatever you want.

621
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,038
Fuck her!

622
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,248
- Alice!
- Jesus.

623
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:39,753
- Too much.
- What? If it happens.

624
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,127
- Okay! Here we go.
- Do it.

625
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,883
First layer, off.

626
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,428
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah!

627
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,556
- Okay.
- Come on, Jess!

628
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,141
Here he comes. He's looking at me.

629
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,858
Happy Boxing Day.

630
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,522
Yes!

631
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,903
It's kind of turning me on,
but I really have to pee,

632
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,825
so it's, like, so confusing.

633
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,825
Mansploitation, bitch! Yes!

634
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,660
Let's get to the beans,
let's get to the beans.

635
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,866
Yeah, just do it.

636
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,747
Get it over with. Get it over with!

637
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,871
- So good!
- Love her.

638
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:19,752
Make her feel special.

639
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,379
- Yes!
- Get that!

640
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,585
He's warm.

641
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,212
All right. I like it.

642
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,546
Okay.

643
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,341
I know you want it, you little slut.

644
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,350
Oh, God! No!

645
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,219
Gross. You sit down.

646
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,853
So aggressive.

647
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,481
- I'm definitely gay.
- Okay, my turn!

648
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,021
- Shit!
- Holy shit.

649
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,736
- I'm good!
- Hey.

650
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,442
Are you okay?

651
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,452
Him? He's fine. You're okay, right, bud?

652
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:51,913
Oh, God.

653
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,491
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit! That's blood!

654
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,454
What the fuck? Oh, God.

655
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,582
- Oh, my God, he's not breathing!
- Shit!

656
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,208
Does anybody know CPR?

657
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,498
- Oh, my God.
- I'll look it up on YouTube!

658
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,128
- No, no, no.
- Oh, my God.

659
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:05,627
We got to do something!

660
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,338
Bugger! It's playing an advert
for toilet tissue.

661
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,513
Jess, do something!

662
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,635
- Shit.
- No, no, no.

663
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,016
Holy shit!

664
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,636
Oh, please, God,
please don't let this happen.

665
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,722
He's bleeding out. I can't stop the blood!

666
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,432
I have some Advil. I'll get it out of my bag.

667
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,142
What's Advil gonna do, Alice?

668
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,229
- It's extra-strength, bitch!
- Somebody call an ambulance!

669
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,573
- Four, five, six, seven, eight...
- He doesn't have a pulse.

670
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,736
Fuck.

671
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:33,909
He's dead.

672
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,913
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

673
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,548
Turn off the fucking music!

674
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,054
- Oh, shit.
- I'm so sorry.

675
00:30:58,732 --> 00:30:59,722
I didn't mean to.

676
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:03,525
I'm so sorry.

677
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,315
- No, no, no.
- God, the blood,

678
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,063
it's going everywhere.

679
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:08,773
Paper towels! Somebody get paper towels!

680
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,191
Why don't you do something, Blair!

681
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,617
I'm delegating!

682
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,699
- I killed a guy.
- It's okay.

683
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,414
Oh, God.

684
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,537
- Not the bathroom towels.
- Shit.

685
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:19,743
What are you talking about!

686
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,122
Who cares about towels right now?

687
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,045
Well, I don't know! I don't know what to do!

688
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,088
I killed a guy!

689
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,799
Oh, God!

690
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,713
- I killed a guy today.
- Okay, okay.

691
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,636
- Deep breaths, deep breaths.
- "What'd you do?"

692
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,509
- Deep breath.
- "I killed a guy."

693
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,177
"What have you been up to?"

694
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,724
"Death."

695
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:38,978
- Keep it in there.
- That's better. That's better.

696
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,480
Time to call the police. Yeah?

697
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,437
No, no, no, don't call the police.
We're all high.

698
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:46,110
Let's get rid of the drugs,
and then we'll call the police.

699
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,983
Yeah, we'll just,
we'll clean up a dead stripper, cool.

700
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,197
Well, technically, he's a prostitute.

701
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,947
- He's a prostitute?
- No.

702
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,244
I got him from Craigslist.

703
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,196
He is a stripper, but then also an escort.

704
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,825
You hired a gigolo?

705
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,043
Don't judge sex work, Blair!

706
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,911
- Oh, my God!
- Frankie!

707
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,748
You know I'm running for public office!
How could you do this to me?

708
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,583
It's worse for me. I have two strikes.

709
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:11,215
If I get a third,
I could go to jail for 25 to life.

710
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,216
I'm not even supposed to be
out of the state right now.

711
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,468
I had to pry my ankle monitor off
with a shoehorn to get here!

712
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,509
Oh, God.

713
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,386
It's the chair's fault.

714
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,096
Fuckin' shit chair!

715
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,183
Wait a minute. You guys, wait a minute!

716
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,109
It was an accident. Right?

717
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,479
So, like, we're not gonna
get in trouble for an accident.

718
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,071
We're in Florida, Alice.

719
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,650
A white dude is dead at
the hands of a bunch of women.

720
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,984
Yeah, white women.

721
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,536
I'm black, in case any of you have forgotten.

722
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,117
I think the only person
who's forgotten that is you.

723
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,411
How dare you.

724
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,204
I rest my case.

725
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,875
I knew this weekend was a terrible idea.

726
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,331
What? No.

727
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,543
This can still be the best
weekend of our fucking lives!

728
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,754
Let's just smile a little bit about it.
Right? Smile more.

729
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,090
Okay, we're gonna be fine.

730
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,891
- We're gonna call the cops, but Jess is right.
- Definitely.

731
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,718
We need to make this seem
as innocent as possible,

732
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,061
so let's get rid of all the drugs.

733
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,766
I'm on it.

734
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,766
Alice, not by doing them!

735
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:10,190
Okay, someone tell me what to do,
and I will do it.

736
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,365
What the...

737
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,698
Shit, shit, shit.

738
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,283
It's pizza.

739
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,959
You guys, what are we gonna do?

740
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:28,504
The house is made of glass. He can see in.

741
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,589
We got to move him, you guys.

742
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,791
Do it, do it, do it.

743
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,462
Go, go, go.

744
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,011
Wait, wait, wait, you guys.

745
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,060
You guys, you guys, you guys,
wait, wait, wait. One second.

746
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,637
Watch the couch.

747
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,896
- Shit.
- Somebody answer the door.

748
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,023
Does anyone have cash for a tip?

749
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,354
I have Australian dollars.

750
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,030
They're stronger than American dollars.

751
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,035
Castelucci Pizza.

752
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,703
- What's this?
- Leave.

753
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,785
- Oh, God.
- Oh, fuck.

754
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,036
I was natural.

755
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:10,997
Okay, open it.

756
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,753
Open it up.

757
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,633
Yes.

758
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,128
How can you eat right now?

759
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,886
Eating is the number one way
people deal with stress, okay?

760
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,638
Don't give me shit.

761
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,013
You guys want some?

762
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,888
- Yeah, I'd go for a slice. One second.
- I'll have a slice. Yeah.

763
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,233
Okay, I think now it's time for us
to call the cops, yeah?

764
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,561
Wait, wait, wait.
I think we should call a lawyer first,

765
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,647
so we know exactly what to say
during the interrogation.

766
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,606
- Okay.
- Wait, I'm sorry, what's going on?

767
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,990
We're gonna be interrogated?

768
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,820
We are 100% gonna be interrogated.

769
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,030
Somebody died in a sketchy way.

770
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:45,786
They're gonna separate us into little cells,

771
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,457
you know, with swinging lights.

772
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:50,127
The coppers are gonna try
to crack us, fucking pigs!

773
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,664
Okay, let's definitely call a lawyer, then.

774
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,999
Oh, my God. My Uncle Jack.

775
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,259
He was on the team
that defended Bernie Madoff.

776
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,337
- Thank God.
- Thank God.

777
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,636
Wait. We should use a burner phone
so there's no record.

778
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,428
- Good idea.
- That's actually a good point.

779
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,351
- Shit!
- What, Alice?

780
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:07,974
The foam party!

781
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,680
Should I sell our passes?

782
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,773
You're right. Let's play it by ear.

783
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,191
Smart, Jess.

784
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,774
Oh, shit! Peter!

785
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,526
- Okay.
- I forgot to call him when I got home.

786
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,077
- Do not answer that.
- I have to.

787
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:24,279
- No!
- Jess. Jess, stop.

788
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,408
Hello!

789
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,782
- Hey, babe.
- Hi. How's it going?

790
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,959
- Stop.
- <i>Are you home safe? You never called.</i>

791
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:31,161
- Hang up. Hang up.
- Yeah, I am.

792
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,335
Yeah, everything's great.

793
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,417
Did you do whippets again?
You sound really weird.

794
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,628
- What?
- <i>Is everything all right?</i>

795
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,588
- Hang up. Hang up. Hang up.
- Stop, stop, stop.

796
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,507
- Peter, something really bad happened.
- No.

797
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,429
- What?
- No, this guy came over.

798
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,051
He was a stripper, like, a prostitute.

799
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,178
- A prostitute?
- <i>And we were drunk,</i>

800
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:47,719
and coked up, and I don't know what to do.

801
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,019
About what? The wedding?

802
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,563
Jess, do you still want to get married?

803
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,148
- You can't, you can't...
- No!

804
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,979
Jess!

805
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,524
I can't believe you just did that.

806
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:01,449
We can't talk to anybody
until we consult with a lawyer.

807
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,695
She's right. You know what,

808
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,823
I'm collecting everyone's phones
until we know what the plan is.

809
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,529
- Agreed?
- Yes.

810
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:07,830
Agreed.

811
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,290
- Well, I have a game on it that relaxes me.
- Give it.

812
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:15,959
Thank you.

813
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,926
Okay, so we got to get this burner phone
from a convenience store.

814
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,219
- Smart.
- Yeah, good idea.

815
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,921
- Frankie and I can go.
- Great.

816
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,474
- Or, like, anybody else could go.
- Why?

817
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,018
- Do we argue?
- We bicker. Yeah, we bicker.

818
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,517
- It's true, but...
- No. I think that we debate,

819
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,394
which is a normal part of talking.

820
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,942
That's funny.
That's the same thing, debating and arguing.

821
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,360
- It's semantics.
- "Semantics."

822
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,438
I didn't realize I was talking
to a wordsmith.

823
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,114
- They used to be lovers, yeah?
- Three syllables.

824
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,112
I'm a wordsmith 'cause
I read the news regularly.

825
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,319
- Is it that obvious?
- Oh, my God. I'm too busy shopping, right?

826
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:49,372
I have a sort of a sense of these things.

827
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,746
Also, she's been fixated on her nips.

828
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,702
Just because I don't use
Tom's of Maine deodorant, which,

829
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:55,877
by the way, does not work...

830
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,205
I don't use Tom's deodorant...

831
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,631
- It's kind of nasty to watch, isn't it?
- ...into my body.

832
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,509
Yeah, so, I call. She picks up.

833
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,212
She sounds very strange.

834
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,512
I know something's wrong immediately.

835
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,089
And then, finally, she admits it.

836
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,799
She says something really bad
happened with a prostitute.

837
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:10,969
That does not mean she cheated.

838
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,937
But if she was going to cheat,
this is when she would do it.

839
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,812
- Oh, God.
- Miami, bachelorette party.

840
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,108
It's pretty classic.

841
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:21,980
It's not cheating if it's
with a prostitute. Technically.

842
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,155
- What?
- What? Yes, it is.

843
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,609
Look, guys, we have
to have realistic attitudes

844
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,239
about sexual exclusivity.

845
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,988
Whatever. It doesn't even matter, because...

846
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,789
I asked her if she still wanted
to get married.

847
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,913
She screamed "no" and then she hung up!

848
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,744
So, guess what, guys,

849
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,171
there's no wedding for you to go to,
so return your tuxes.

850
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,668
No!

851
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,500
- No. Hell, no.
- Fine, keep your tuxes,

852
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:43,835
but my wedding's off.

853
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:45,795
It's not a shock, right?

854
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:49,599
I mean, buddy, I love you,
you're one of my best friends,

855
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,222
but you're a six and she's a...

856
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,098
Twenty.

857
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,522
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- He can hear you.

858
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,565
I'm feeling... I'm feeling weak.

859
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,187
I'm feeling dizzy, I'm...

860
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,190
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Oh, my God.

861
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,650
I knew I shouldn't date out of my league,
I knew it.

862
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:07,074
When she first asked me out,
I thought it was a prank.

863
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,073
I could feel her pulling away,
but I thought it was work.

864
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,529
- I'm gonna be sick.
- No, no, no.

865
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,242
- Give him some Madeira.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

866
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,416
- Yeah.
- Peter, that's it. Just take a sip.

867
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,536
- I'll get you a soft cheese!
- Yes!

868
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,459
This is so stupid.

869
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:25,213
Yeah, but this way no one can
definitively ID our face.

870
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,257
Old people. Perfect.

871
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,052
Any brand is fine.

872
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,516
What's that on your face?

873
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:33,976
A detoxifying mud mask.

874
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:36,145
Look, we need a burner phone, okay?

875
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:40,145
- Here's some cash.
- Again, a burner phone,

876
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,898
and you can find that behind the counter.

877
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,736
- Okay. We heard you.
- Inside.

878
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:48,032
You baby boomers are so demanding.

879
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,403
I know.

880
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,736
- Jesus. Come on, Ma.
- I'm sick and tired of this shit.

881
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,198
I can't believe he's dead.

882
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,752
- And it's, like, all my fault.
- No, no.

883
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,705
It really is a tragedy, you know?

884
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:08,336
He could have been a scientist
that was gonna cure cancer or something.

885
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,922
- It's nice of you to say.
- Yeah.

886
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,601
Guys, is he looking, like, straight at me?

887
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,513
- Oh, my God, he's...
- Yeah. Yeah.

888
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,223
He's looking at me, right?

889
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,191
Hi, baby boy.

890
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,694
Mummy Hubbard's here.

891
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,863
She's gonna send you home.

892
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,196
Okay.

893
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,622
Sleep now.

894
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,909
Oh, no. Jesus, no. No, no, no.

895
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,660
- Okay, why don't we...
- I don't like it, I don't like it,

896
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:42,877
- I don't like it.
- Guys, I got it.

897
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:44,872
- I got it.
- I'm done.

898
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,673
- I'm done.
- There we go.

899
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,467
He looks good, right?

900
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,170
Totally.

901
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,973
- Oh, my God, Jess.
- What?

902
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,516
Look at this ring.

903
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,935
It's even bigger in real life
than it is on Skype.

904
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,642
Yeah, he did a good job.

905
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,356
You guys Skype?

906
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,316
- Yes.
- Do we?

907
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,821
Yes.

908
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:14,368
It's really nice to just sort of,
you know, see the person

909
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,491
when you're talking to them.

910
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,455
- I didn't know that.
- Yes.

911
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,873
You don't know Skype?

912
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,042
Skype is a free video calling app.

913
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,581
- You should...
- No, I know what Skype is.

914
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,879
Jess, you said you couldn't
remember your password.

915
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,167
Well, it is really hard to sign in.

916
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,424
- Oh, shit!
- Shit!

917
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,468
- Whose dog is that?
- Go away! Go away!

918
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,174
- Go! Go, go.
- Charlie? Here, boy!

919
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,514
- The owner is coming towards the house.
- Oh, God.

920
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,516
No, no, no. You're being too loud.

921
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,932
I can speak to animals,
we have a deep understanding,

922
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,061
- so I got this.
- Charlie?

923
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,684
- Just go!
- Okay, be careful, though.

924
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,019
- Okay.
- Here, boy!

925
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,320
Okay, Charlie. Come on.

926
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,022
Come on, come on.

927
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,237
Shit!

928
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,531
- Charlie!
- You stay. I'm bringing him to you.

929
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,659
This is impossible, anybody can see
into the house from the beach.

930
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,160
- This is crazy.
- I know.

931
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,207
If someone reports it
before we do, we're dead.

932
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,036
Well, we just... We have
to get the body out of sight, that's all.

933
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,792
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

934
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:08,963
- Okay.
- You all right?

935
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,086
- You all right?
- Good.

936
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,006
Oh, my God, Pip,
I can see all of his teeth marks.

937
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,632
That looks really bad.

938
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,463
No, no, no. This is...

939
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,968
That's not... I'm good.

940
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,766
Yeah, she's fine. Look at her in the eyes.

941
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,391
Okay? So let's just get
the body out of sight,

942
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,767
and then we'll put him back
before we call the cops. Yeah?

943
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,018
- Let's do it. Right?
- Yes.

944
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,941
- Let's go! Okay!
- Let's do it.

945
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:29,852
Hold the door. Hang on one sec.

946
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,653
- Got it.
- There's two steps here. Hold on.

947
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,731
- Yeah, we got it.
- There's two steps.

948
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:35,653
- Put him down.
- That was me.

949
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,234
Can somebody turn the lights on?

950
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,115
- I'll get it.
- There we go.

951
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,321
- That's better.
- Oh, God!

952
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,452
Shit! Alice, cover the body!

953
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,874
Why? Why? Why?

954
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,451
Pippa, what did you do?

955
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,332
This is a poltergeist situation.

956
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:49,834
I'm not doing anything.

957
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,460
- All right.
- There's got to be a fuse box.

958
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,552
- Oh, God. There is a taxi.
- Oh, no, no.

959
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,004
There is a taxi right here.

960
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:59,552
No! No, no, no.

961
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:01,224
No, thank you.

962
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:02,809
- Cover the body.
- Hide me. Hide me.

963
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:04,478
- Balls!
- Jesus Christ.

964
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,437
Find a quilt. Find a fucking quilt.

965
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,640
- What the...
- Jesus!

966
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,685
- No. My water broke! My water broke!
- What?

967
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:12,940
No, no, I just peed.

968
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,026
- I have no control over this.
- Pippa.

969
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,532
Close, you fuck.

970
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,236
- Here you go, sir. Thank you.
- Thought I peed. I didn't pee.

971
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,116
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Thank you.

972
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,869
- Safe home!
- What the fuck is going on in here?

973
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,951
We're starting a garage band.
Do you guys play bass?

974
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,911
We're hiding a body.
What do you think we're doing?

975
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,913
Stop saying "body" so many times.

976
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:32,373
- Alice, what the hell are you doing, man?
- Sorry.

977
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:33,833
- Come on.
- God!

978
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,713
Lift him up with your legs.
Lift with your legs.

979
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,257
I swear to God,
he's getting heavier every time.

980
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,463
Just hold one second.

981
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,889
- There's two stairs up here.
- No!

982
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,841
- I got it.
- Let's take a break. Let's take a break.

983
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:43,971
Break, break, break.

984
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,344
- No, no, no.
- Okay.

985
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,096
- Okay.
- I am out of shape.

986
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:49,477
- Really good.
- Quick question.

987
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,479
Why are we moving the dead stripper?

988
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,236
The whole house is made out of glass.

989
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:57,110
This is impossible.
You can see in everywhere.

990
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:59,859
Where could we put him
that he's not gonna be seen?

991
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,289
<i>So, what do you think, Uncle Jack?</i>

992
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,417
They could charge you
with involuntary manslaughter,

993
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:17,877
but it's not that easy to prove.

994
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:19,629
- Thank God.
- Well, that's not bad.

995
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,089
- That's okay.
- <i>Just don't touch the body or the scene,</i>

996
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:23,890
- <i>and you'll be fine.</i>
- What?

997
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,135
Okay, so actually, we have already moved him

998
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:27,436
to a sex swing, Your Honor.

999
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:28,808
What?

1000
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:32,767
I said, "Actually, we have already moved him
to a sex swing, Your Honor."

1001
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,976
<i>I heard you.</i>

1002
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,108
You knowingly tampered with the scene,

1003
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:39,440
<i>which means you're guilty
of accessory after the fact,</i>

1004
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:43,869
and they'll have a strong case
for involuntary manslaughter.

1005
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,612
Wait, what does that mean?

1006
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,663
<i>Up to 15 years in prison.</i>

1007
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,159
- What?
- Fifteen?

1008
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,961
- <i>Well, what can we do?</i>
- Are we on an open line here, girls?

1009
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,879
- It's a burner phone.
- <i>Good.</i>

1010
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,711
Like I told Rob Lowe,

1011
00:43:57,218 --> 00:44:00,882
if there's no body, there's no case.

1012
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,140
We can't just chop him up.

1013
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:09,804
You know what?
I'll just tell the cops it was just me.

1014
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,268
No, we all moved the body.

1015
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,308
It's a crime.

1016
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:17,645
Well, yeah, but if we just,
like, explain the situation...

1017
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,695
What are you talking about, "Explain"?

1018
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,445
Last year, a guy in Tampa,
he threatened to kill his wife,

1019
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:23,867
so she fired a warning shot,

1020
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:26,070
and she went to jail for 20 years.

1021
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:29,414
This country should be burned to the ground!

1022
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,043
Shit.

1023
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,584
I was so close. Peter.

1024
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,757
My career.

1025
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:40,421
It's all over, just like that.

1026
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,508
I'm gonna do real time.

1027
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:44,926
Maybe life.

1028
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,473
You guys are gonna get off with a few years.

1029
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,427
I can't do any years.
I'm in the middle of a custody battle.

1030
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,726
- What?
- What?

1031
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:51,849
What?

1032
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,149
Malcolm and I separated six months ago.

1033
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,352
You didn't tell me.

1034
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:01,067
Yeah, you've been a little preoccupied, Jess.

1035
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:03,694
Why didn't you tell me?

1036
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,151
I didn't need your judgment.

1037
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,696
Blair, I would never judge you
for something like that.

1038
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,412
Oh, my God, my students.

1039
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,289
They idolize me.

1040
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,543
They think I'm, like, the best fucking adult

1041
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:21,046
in the whole fucking world.

1042
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,546
They'll turn to crime.

1043
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,799
I can't go to jail.

1044
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,763
I couldn't even make it
through the first episode

1045
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,135
of <i>Orange Is the New Black.</i>

1046
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:29,967
None of us can.

1047
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,222
It's too soapy, right?

1048
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:35,063
No, I meant none of us can go to jail.

1049
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,477
Wait, you guys.

1050
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:39,769
Even if we don't get charged
with this tampering with evidence thing,

1051
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,398
we don't know who this man is.

1052
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,230
His family could come seek revenge.

1053
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:46,112
He could be part of a cartel
that's gonna cut off our toes

1054
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:47,238
and stick them up our bums.

1055
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:48,318
She's right.

1056
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,863
We'll have to look over our shoulders
for the rest of our lives.

1057
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,991
He did say that

1058
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,749
it would be hard to convict

1059
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,835
with no body.

1060
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:04,377
I mean, it was an accident.

1061
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:06,629
And he's not part
of an escort company, you know?

1062
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,509
So I don't think anybody knows he's here.

1063
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:16,688
We got to get rid of him.

1064
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:17,973
- We gotta, right?
- Yeah.

1065
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:19,183
- We do.
- We have to.

1066
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:21,439
- I mean, we don't want to.
- No, of course we don't want to.

1067
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,731
We didn't want to kill him.

1068
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:24,108
- We have no other option.
- But we have to.

1069
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,439
- Of course we have to.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1070
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:26,523
Must.

1071
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,701
<i>Hey, it's Blair. Don't leave a message.</i>

1072
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:33,614
Okay. That's it. None of them are picking up.

1073
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,165
That means something really bad happened.

1074
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:38,995
Dude, this is, like, the third girlfriend
that's cheated on you.

1075
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:41,459
What is that? What's going on, buddy?

1076
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:43,632
Does your dick bend weird when it gets hard?

1077
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:44,754
No.

1078
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,376
- All right.
- Doesn't matter.

1079
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:49,714
Let's get you on Tinder right now,
so you can start on a rebound.

1080
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,553
- No, I don't want to be on Tinder, okay?
- Come on.

1081
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,181
You've gotten over other girls,
you can get over her.

1082
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:59,185
Yeah, this isn't some girl, this is Jess.
I'm not gonna get over her, you know?

1083
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:00,482
And I don't want to get over her.

1084
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,392
Then, this time,
do something about it, Peter.

1085
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,281
You're right.

1086
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,992
You're right, I got to go to Miami,
and I got to win her back.

1087
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,491
- Yes, dude. Yes. Awesome.
- Okay, okay.

1088
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:17,450
The first flight out of Charleston
gets in at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

1089
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,659
- No.
- There is a train

1090
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:22,167
that gets there tomorrow afternoon
and there's room in the quiet car.

1091
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,422
Not quick enough. You got to sad astronaut.

1092
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,084
What?

1093
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,135
He has to sad astronaut.

1094
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:30,713
- Okay, what is that?
- That's nothing to me.

1095
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,672
- Sad astronaut?
- That news story?

1096
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:33,974
Okay.

1097
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,594
Lisa Marie Nowak was an astronaut.

1098
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,103
And she was in love
with another astronaut named Will.

1099
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:45,728
Now, Will cheated on Lisa
with some hottie Air Force captain.

1100
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,947
Lisa found out and was pissed.

1101
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:51,783
So, Lisa decided to deal with it.

1102
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,529
Once and for all.
And she got a bunch of adult diapers,

1103
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,205
so she wouldn't have to piss on the way,

1104
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,745
and she drove straight from
Houston to Orlando

1105
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,125
to, like, kidnap the Air Force...
It's... The story gets dark quick.

1106
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:08,417
Point is, she used that crazy
astrophysicist brain

1107
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,547
to find the quickest way to Florida.

1108
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:14,260
- You want to get Jess back, right?
- Yeah.

1109
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,763
Then you got to sad astronaut, bro.

1110
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:21,142
Let's get some diapers.

1111
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,864
Not this brand! These leak!

1112
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,565
- Jesus Christ.
- It's not that bad.

1113
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,571
I think it's the body on top.

1114
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,282
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Okay.

1115
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,782
Okay, wait, does anyone know
how to actually drive this thing, or...

1116
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:22,866
I could do it.

1117
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:28,210
I took one to school every day growing up,
so, I feel pretty confident.

1118
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,415
- Great.
- Perfect.

1119
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:31,667
- Hello!
- Shit.

1120
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,677
- Hello!
- Oh, my gosh. Shit!

1121
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,049
- The neighbors!
- Get him off. Get him off.

1122
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,472
Okay, oh, my God, oh, my God, what do we do?

1123
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,345
- No, no... Okay. All right.
- No, no!

1124
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,270
- So happy to see you.
- Okay.

1125
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,352
- Nope.
- Dang.

1126
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,816
We hoped you were skinny-dipping.

1127
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,519
- No.
- No.

1128
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:51,649
- Nope.
- Okay.

1129
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:54,732
- My, my.
- What do we have here?

1130
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:02,702
You know, I think they just wanted
to make love in international waters.

1131
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,245
- Yeah.
- Maybe they need our help.

1132
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:09,546
No. I think we should probably let them
do their thing, you know?

1133
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,209
So, let's just...

1134
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,717
This certainly gets me in the mood.

1135
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,672
Hey, Blair.

1136
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:18,505
- You need a tampon?
- Maybe.

1137
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:21,512
We just opened
a bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape,

1138
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:24,219
and we're listening to some
remastered Fleetwood Mac.

1139
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:26,934
- That's so nice.
- It is so good,

1140
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,357
you could hear the cocaine in Stevie's voice.

1141
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,729
- I bet.
- We'd love for you to join us.

1142
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,731
- That's so sweet.
- No pressure.

1143
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:35,063
Unless it's asked for.

1144
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,323
Okay.

1145
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,359
I am fully exhausted.

1146
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,570
- So tired, you know?
- Understood.

1147
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:43,326
We're fluent in body language.

1148
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,906
I bet you are.

1149
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,081
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1150
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,628
All right.

1151
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:54,837
- God.
- Oh, my God.

1152
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:56,668
- Pippa. They're gone. Pippa.
- They're moving out.

1153
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,344
- What is going on there?
- Pippa!

1154
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,637
- Pippa!
- What?

1155
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,339
Oh, my God.

1156
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,799
Yeah. Okay.

1157
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:06,561
- Sorry.
- Dude.

1158
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,351
- Let's dump him, yeah?
- Yeah, let's dump him.

1159
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,647
Let's do the dump.

1160
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,026
Okay, Spanish language CDs.

1161
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:21,526
If Jess hooked up with a Spanish speaker,
you're gonna want to reason with him.

1162
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:25,572
And I got this generic Russian Adderall.
My little brother ordered it online.

1163
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:26,873
It will help you focus.

1164
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:29,952
It's super strong, but it is expired, so...

1165
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,453
- Thank you so much.
- Hey.

1166
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:32,958
- I love you.
- I love you, too, dude.

1167
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,290
- Get her back.
- Thanks.

1168
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:39,545
You are peeing.

1169
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,129
I'm so scared.

1170
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,558
I feel like we should say something.

1171
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:46,969
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Good idea.

1172
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,229
We're really sorry.

1173
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:53,066
- You deserved better.
- Yeah.

1174
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:56,027
There's nothing we could do
to bring you back, but...

1175
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,822
We promise to spend the rest of our lives
trying to be better people.

1176
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,151
We owe that to you.

1177
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:06,575
God, we're so sorry.

1178
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,327
So sorry.

1179
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:09,870
So sorry, man.

1180
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:11,660
We suck.

1181
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,290
Okay, you can dump him now!

1182
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,292
Aye aye, Captain.

1183
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:26,099
This never happened. Right?

1184
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,809
- Nope.
- It happened.

1185
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,265
Right?

1186
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,764
- No, we're not gonna talk about it.
- Got it, got it.

1187
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,275
Okay, bye.

1188
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,687
That could have been more delicate.

1189
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:44,985
She's going really fast.

1190
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:46,737
I did it!

1191
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,573
- Oh, my God, what the fuck is she doing?
- What is she doing?

1192
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:52,705
Holy shit!

1193
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:55,621
- Oh, my God!
- Are you okay?

1194
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,255
I'm good. I'm really good.

1195
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,672
Are you sure,
'cause you landed right on your neck.

1196
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,880
Yeah, I just did a sort of straight shot,
landed on the neck,

1197
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,714
snap, and we're back up.

1198
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,258
- It was good.
- What happened?

1199
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:09,763
I thought you knew how to drive those things.

1200
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,563
Yeah, no, I definitely do, but
I think the gas and the brake are different

1201
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:15,140
in Australia, so I got confused.

1202
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,355
- How are you alive right now?
- I don't know.

1203
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:20,103
But I'll take it.

1204
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:24,900
Well, body dumped, girl's alive.

1205
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:27,911
- What's next?
- We should get the fuck out of here.

1206
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,578
- Great idea.
- Yeah, I like that.

1207
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:32,332
- Let's do that.
- You sure you're okay?

1208
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:37,745
Guys?

1209
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,039
She should probably get a CAT scan.

1210
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:41,250
Okay.

1211
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,092
She's fine.

1212
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,054
- Is there any more pizza left?
- I don't think so.

1213
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:51,134
No!

1214
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:52,719
Jesus, dude, we can order more.

1215
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,429
No, not that. That!

1216
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,564
- What?
- The sexy neighbors!

1217
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,516
They have footage of us dumping the body.

1218
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,564
We should just turn ourselves in, right?

1219
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,229
- We're fucked.
- No.

1220
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:05,323
We got rid of the body. We just have to
get rid of the footage, that's all.

1221
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:06,445
- Right?
- Yes.

1222
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:07,863
- Yep. Yep.
- Yeah, okay.

1223
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,660
- Yes.
- Well, how?

1224
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:16,493
No.

1225
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,290
Absolutely not.

1226
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,746
Thank you.

1227
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,005
Your house is so...

1228
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:32,843
- Funky.
- Thank you.

1229
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,306
You should see our panic room.

1230
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,230
May I?

1231
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,120
It's happening. God, you make me red-hot.

1232
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,634
You know what would be really, really sexy?

1233
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,219
Please tell me.

1234
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:10,005
If we got this on tape.

1235
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:14,100
You naughty girl.

1236
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:21,983
Actually, I noticed that you guys have
these cameras outside and it's always been

1237
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:26,230
a fantasy of mine to get caught
on a security camera, so...

1238
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,070
<i>Mesdemoiselles?</i>

1239
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:32,410
Okay. Okay.

1240
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:36,827
Thank you.

1241
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,002
Okay.

1242
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:56,142
- Okay. Yeah.
- Is it okay that we're watching this?

1243
00:55:56,562 --> 00:56:00,306
Yeah, we're watching for Blair.
You know, for her safety. We're monitoring.

1244
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,773
- Man, Blair looks great.
- Yeah, she looks great.

1245
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,483
You ready?

1246
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,858
- Yeah, think so.
- All right.

1247
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:11,942
Relax.

1248
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,655
I've got you.

1249
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:15,407
- Holy shit!
- My...

1250
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,909
- Interesting.
- She's showing off. To me.

1251
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,661
Yes! Yes!

1252
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:20,992
Give me those. Give me those.

1253
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,637
<i>Hey, it's Jess. Leave a message.</i>

1254
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:38,385
Jess, it's Peter.

1255
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,057
How are you?

1256
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,984
Just calling again. Okay. Oh, man.

1257
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,066
What a story this'll be.

1258
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:51,656
For the grandkids. If we get married.

1259
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,947
Do me a favor, call me back.
Let me know you're okay.

1260
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,998
I love you so much. Please call me. Bye.

1261
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:18,679
<i>Hey, it's Jess. Leave a message.</i>

1262
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:20,931
Jess!

1263
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:22,429
Yes!

1264
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:34,190
I would love a copy of the tape, you know,

1265
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:37,118
for, like, jerking off later, whatever.

1266
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,328
Me, too. What's the tape?

1267
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,873
The tape. The naughty tape we just made.

1268
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,496
You know, the DVD or the...

1269
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,577
You know, from the cameras.

1270
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,205
Those don't work.

1271
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:52,717
- Excuse me, what?
- Yeah, they don't work, like she said.

1272
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,881
But we know that's not what this was about.

1273
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:56,759
Right? This was fantasy fulfillment.

1274
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,720
- Creating a <i>mise en scène.</i>
- I'm sorry. Why...

1275
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:04,228
Why would someone have
security cameras that don't work?

1276
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,892
They didn't charge us
for the first three months.

1277
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,349
After that, we didn't want
to pay for the service.

1278
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,108
You know, they keep out the riffraff.

1279
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,811
You'll just have to jerk off
as the Italians do.

1280
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:13,980
To your memories.

1281
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:20,286
Wait, so, Blair, so there's no footage?

1282
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,488
No.

1283
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:24,953
Oh, my gosh. So we're in the clear!

1284
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,284
That's great.

1285
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:29,417
- Yeah.
- She was so intuitive.

1286
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,633
She was inside me.

1287
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,172
And then she was outside me.

1288
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,131
And then she was me.

1289
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,890
- So, we're good.
- Almost, except I probably have HPV now.

1290
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,429
Whatever. We all have HPV.

1291
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,981
I mean, I don't have HPV.

1292
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:54,104
Alice, they say if you had sex
after the year 1991, you have HPV.

1293
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,738
Then, I mean, I definitely have HPV then.

1294
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:59,029
I have, like, clumps and clumps of it.

1295
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:03,037
Cool. Let's clean up
and get the hell out of here.

1296
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:04,329
Okay.

1297
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,565
- Okay.
- Looks pretty good.

1298
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,017
- We did good.
- Got it.

1299
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:36,070
- Yes. Nice. High five, everyone.
- Lovely.

1300
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:46,205
<i>This child is not my son.</i>

1301
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:55,464
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1302
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:01,304
Shit. My pants.

1303
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:07,184
I don't have time for this.

1304
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,021
Good evening, Officer.

1305
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,647
How can I be of service to you?

1306
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,157
- Sir, you been drinking?
- Absolutely not.

1307
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,115
I did do a wine tasting earlier this evening,
Italian reds mostly,

1308
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:26,787
but you don't really drink it,
you mostly spit.

1309
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,159
You take sips and you spit into a bucket.

1310
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:30,663
What the... All right, sir, I'm gonna ask
you to get out of the vehicle.

1311
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:31,833
- No.
- Now!

1312
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,206
- Officer...
- Now!

1313
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:35,253
Hands. Move slow.

1314
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,591
Officer, I can explain.

1315
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,388
She's a 20!

1316
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:47,599
Okay, before we go,

1317
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,510
we got to do human friendtipede, yeah?

1318
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:50,640
- What?
- Alice.

1319
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,016
- No way.
- Yes.

1320
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,895
- It's tradition.
- Alice, quick "Q."

1321
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:57,234
What is a human friendtipede?

1322
01:00:57,445 --> 01:01:00,404
It's a photo we always take
that's like the movie <i>Human Centipede.</i>

1323
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:03,988
Where they're sewn together,
mouth to anus, but it's with friends,

1324
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:06,327
- so it's special.
- Come on now, Alice.

1325
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:08,286
- I don't know about that.
- I feel like not the appropriate...

1326
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:11,332
Guys, if I don't post a ton of pictures
from this weekend,

1327
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,912
it's gonna look suspicious.

1328
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,202
Like we killed someone.

1329
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:18,581
Okay. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I
think we should do the human friendtipede.

1330
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:21,922
- Yes!
- But we cannot photograph the crime scene.

1331
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:23,594
Okay. I get the middle.

1332
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,472
Why do you want the middle?

1333
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,141
Okay. Oh, my God, amazoir.

1334
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,431
Say "friendtipede."

1335
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:32,978
Friendtipede!

1336
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:35,640
Cute.

1337
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:37,524
Yes!

1338
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:39,318
- Let's see it.
- It's ridiculous.

1339
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:43,736
- Alice, stop. You look really pretty.
- No, look!

1340
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:49,570
- Oh, my God.
- No! Come on! No!

1341
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:52,323
- Shit! Damn it!
- Is that our guy?

1342
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,125
- Are you kidding me?
- Shit!

1343
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,786
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

1344
01:01:57,005 --> 01:01:59,088
God, I thought you weighed him down.

1345
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:02,380
I did. I put rocks in his pockets.
I guess his pants fell off.

1346
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,214
Men need to wear belts.

1347
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:06,804
Yeah. How dare they not sink
when we murder them.

1348
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:11,221
Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T, S, R, Q, P, O,

1349
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:15,055
N, M, L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A.

1350
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:25,899
Okay.

1351
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:33,281
Did you see that?

1352
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:38,957
- You only had to walk a straight line.
- I know. I just followed my body.

1353
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:40,963
- Are you a dancer or...
- No.

1354
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:43,006
I've never done anything
like that before in my life.

1355
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:44,834
I still got to give you a speeding ticket.

1356
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,794
Please. That's great.

1357
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:48,345
Slow down.

1358
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,506
- Thank you, Officer.
- I almost shot you.

1359
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:53,851
I know. That was nuts.
Also, don't shoot anybody.

1360
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:59,106
We can't get rid of his body
in broad daylight, you guys.

1361
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,184
We have to think of something. Come on.

1362
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:02,810
Ideas?

1363
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,900
- Kiwi! You up?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1364
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:09,109
- We need everyone's brain on this, so...
- Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

1365
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,865
So, here's what I'm gonna do.

1366
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,696
I'm gonna go to the beach

1367
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:15,956
and do a bit of mindful meditation.

1368
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,204
And when I come back,

1369
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:20,123
I'm gonna have a be-genius idea.

1370
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:22,755
Yeah? All right.

1371
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:24,753
We got it.

1372
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,922
We're never gonna get rid of his body.

1373
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,379
He's gonna follow us around
for the rest of our lives.

1374
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:32,306
- Oh, God.
- No.

1375
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,137
- Police!
- Shit.

1376
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:35,802
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1377
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,932
Do you think the neighbors called them?
Maybe they got suspicious.

1378
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:40,105
- Oh, my God.
- Police! Open up! Now!

1379
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:43,522
Women, this is my world. I will handle this.
I got you.

1380
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:45,527
Turn out the lights and hide.

1381
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:00,410
Good evening, Officer.

1382
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:02,870
Step aside, miss.

1383
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:04,705
What's this all about?

1384
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:06,124
Put your hands where I can see them.

1385
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:10,048
Officer, I am cooperating. You see? Hello.

1386
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:11,470
Get your hands against the wall.

1387
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:12,672
- I am not...
- Get your hands against the wall!

1388
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:14,803
I am taking a passive stance.

1389
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:16,680
My body is limp for you!

1390
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:18,428
Spread them.

1391
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:25,526
What are you doing? No.

1392
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,273
No! No!

1393
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:31,198
- Fuck!
- Jesus!

1394
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:35,156
- Frankie! Frankie!
- Oh, my God.

1395
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:37,697
Now we have a dead guy
and an unconscious cop?

1396
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,453
- What is wrong with you?
- Are you kidding me?

1397
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:42,330
He's obviously a rape cop.
This is what they do!

1398
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,667
When they have dirt on you, they sexually
assault you, knowing you won't report it.

1399
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:48,382
- Daniel Holtzclaw, Oklahoma City?
- Who?

1400
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,217
He sexually assaulted eight women.

1401
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,836
Like Matt Dillon in <i>Crash.</i>

1402
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,756
- Oh, my God, that was horrendous.
- What a nightmare.

1403
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,217
Information is power, guys.
I mean it. I mean it.

1404
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,597
Okay, chill out. You're from Brentwood,

1405
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:01,474
and your dad used to be
John Mayer's accountant.

1406
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:05,558
Okay. "You are not your father's daughters
but mothers unto your own."

1407
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:06,938
Wait, is that John Mayer?

1408
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,985
It's Malcolm X.

1409
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:11,233
- Pretty sure it's John Mayer.
- Fathers. Fathers.

1410
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:13,278
Okay, you guys, you guys,
we have to move this guy

1411
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:15,906
before the neighbors return
to eat Blair out again.

1412
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:17,995
I'd be fine with that.

1413
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:19,288
- All right.
- Fuck.

1414
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:21,286
All right, one, two, three.

1415
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:30,799
Frankie, how many strippers did you order?

1416
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:33,506
Just the one.

1417
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:36,255
Then who's this guy?

1418
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:39,220
- Let me see his dick real quick.
- Good call.

1419
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:41,807
- Wait, what?
- The stripper I ordered had a dick pic

1420
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,387
in his ad. No face.

1421
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:46,849
- But I can ID him by his member.
- Cool. Okay.

1422
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,064
I'm not sure.

1423
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:54,740
He had a boner in his ad.

1424
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:56,192
This one's soft.

1425
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:59,453
I can get it hard. Let's go, feet.

1426
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:02,034
- What? No. No, no, no, no.
- Stop. No, wait. Stop, please.

1427
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:10,168
Okay, yes. This is the stripper I ordered.

1428
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,215
This is Scotty with the Body.

1429
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:14,881
Then who did we kill?

1430
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:40,698
- Hello?
- <i>This is Banknorth.</i>

1431
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:43,280
<i>We have detected unusual activity
on your account.</i>

1432
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,032
<i>If you have attempted a purchase at</i>

1433
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:48,335
<i>Quickie Stop in Port St. Lucie,
please press one.</i>

1434
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:52,335
<i>Thank you for pressing two.</i>

1435
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:55,042
<i>Your card has been suspended
due to unusual activity.</i>

1436
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:56,422
No. No.

1437
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:01,424
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1438
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,102
- How's that?
- Yeah, that's good.

1439
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,443
If you're looking for our cell phones,
I locked them in this drawer

1440
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:18,775
and I'm not gonna open it, okay?

1441
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:22,696
Please let me at least text Peter. I feel
like he's totally freaking out right now.

1442
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:24,412
Not until everything is sorted out.

1443
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:25,740
We made a plan.

1444
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,033
Alice.

1445
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,618
- What's up, dude? What are you doing?
- What?

1446
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:32,630
I'm just making sure nothing's broken.

1447
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,248
I think he's fine.

1448
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:35,837
Yeah, he's really fine.

1449
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,418
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

1450
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:40,801
You need to masturbate more.
You're, like, severely horny.

1451
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,307
I know. I just don't like
to do it in front of my cockatiel.

1452
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:45,767
She's very smart.

1453
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:48,471
- Why don't you put her in a cage?
- She is in a cage.

1454
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:50,472
But I'm loud. I'm a screamer.

1455
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:52,479
- I remember.
- Yeah, I forgot about that.

1456
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:54,856
And it kind of sounds like her.

1457
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,737
So she thinks I'm talking to her.

1458
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,356
I'm like,
"No, I'm just fucking touching myself."

1459
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,691
Like, "Back off."

1460
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:03,615
Cool, so back to our life-changing emergency?

1461
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:06,948
Okay, the stripper's here, he's alive.

1462
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,492
- That's good. Right?
- Yeah.

1463
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,248
There is still a dead guy
in the closet, so...

1464
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,045
- Who is that guy?
- We could get rid

1465
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:16,089
of him if we just had a car, you know?

1466
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:18,418
Oh, my God. How did this guy get here?

1467
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,432
That'll work.

1468
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:27,763
- Thank God!
- Will it?

1469
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:31,104
All right, we're gonna drive
to the alligator bog, dump the body.

1470
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:32,981
We're gonna return the Smart car,

1471
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:36,026
wake up the G-string guy,
tell him he hit his head really hard.

1472
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,978
- Blair's gonna give him a ton of cash.
- Wait, what?

1473
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:40,109
- And then we're home free.
- I love it. Yeah.

1474
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:49,990
Alligator bog.

1475
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:53,327
<i>You will arrive at your destination
in 45 minutes.</i>

1476
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:56,672
Yeah.

1477
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,467
Can I do your...
Do you mind if I do your thing?

1478
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,178
Don't litter.

1479
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:31,331
All right.

1480
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,917
Hey, thanks a lot, man.

1481
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:36,162
- For you.
- Thank you so much.

1482
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,087
So, I got meth.

1483
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:40,420
You looking? 40 bucks.

1484
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:43,628
No, thank you so much. I just need gas money.

1485
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:47,260
Hey, listen, do you want
to suck my dick for 15 bucks?

1486
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:50,183
- No. Thank you.
- Okay.

1487
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,761
Good luck, man.

1488
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:53,186
Thanks, man.

1489
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:01,444
<i>You will arrive in 25 minutes.</i>

1490
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,113
This is so uncomfortable.

1491
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:05,320
I mean, does this thing go any faster?

1492
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:10,696
- Wait!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1493
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:20,835
So it does go faster?

1494
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:33,060
- Hi, sir. May I...
- Get the fuck away from my car.

1495
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:34,807
- Okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- God.

1496
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,976
Let me suck your dick real fast.

1497
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,231
What?

1498
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:41,109
- Please?
- No. What is with this place?

1499
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:43,069
Okay, listen...

1500
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:44,734
Do you have any meth?

1501
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:52,363
- I could sell you meth, yeah.
- Really?

1502
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:56,078
- 80 bucks.
- 80 dollars...

1503
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,038
There you go.

1504
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,259
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

1505
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,671
I want to buy some meth.

1506
01:11:10,892 --> 01:11:12,679
Only thing is, though,

1507
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:15,970
you got to do a little bump, though,
so I know that you're not a cop.

1508
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:18,271
No, man. Please. I'm not a cop.

1509
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:20,102
You want the meth or not?

1510
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:22,517
Okay.

1511
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:25,354
Here we go.

1512
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:28,907
- And one for Papa Bear.
- It burns. All right.

1513
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:30,362
40 bucks. Not a cop. Come on.

1514
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:34,705
- Yes. Great. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1515
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:37,537
So, still a no-go on the BJ, or...

1516
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:39,368
No, I'm good. Thanks.

1517
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:41,294
That's fine.

1518
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:43,831
Actually,

1519
01:11:44,509 --> 01:11:46,341
there's somebody I want to introduce you to.

1520
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:48,885
- Right on!
- Very nice to meet you.

1521
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,553
- Good to meet you, too.
- This is so perfect.

1522
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,007
- Yeah, go. Please, go.
- Okay. Okay.

1523
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:56,518
You got to do it, man. That's true love.

1524
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:15,074
Guys, I fell asleep.

1525
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,655
I fell asleep.

1526
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:20,125
I had this nightmare
where we had all killed a guy.

1527
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:22,419
- That is a reality.
- No, we killed somebody.

1528
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:24,713
What? No!

1529
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:28,801
Oh, my God! Jet lag is insane, you guys.

1530
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,468
It's no joke!

1531
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:32,213
No joke!

1532
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:33,881
Damn it!

1533
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:37,806
Did you happen to come up with
a be-genius idea out there?

1534
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:39,303
Yeah, I did, actually.

1535
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:43,562
In my dream, I remembered
that there was this guy in Australia

1536
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:45,517
who cooked his girlfriend and ate her.

1537
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:48,153
- Kiwi.
- I can't 'cause I am vegan.

1538
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:49,320
- But...
- Kiwi.

1539
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,069
God, I'm so tired.

1540
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:53,738
We should turn ourselves in. We're guilty.

1541
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:56,445
No, we are innocent, because
this was an accident, you guys.

1542
01:12:56,664 --> 01:12:57,700
Stop saying that.

1543
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:01,124
Maybe if you hadn't been lethally horny,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

1544
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:03,911
I was coked up because you bought us drugs.

1545
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:06,292
I didn't force you to do the drugs, Alice.

1546
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,089
And you know what,
nobody's talking about how it was

1547
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:10,007
Blair's idea to get a stripper
in the first place.

1548
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:12,006
Yeah, but you're never to blame, right?

1549
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:14,509
"Look at me, I'm Frankie.
I live in a storage unit.

1550
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,847
- "I'm saving the world."
- You know what?

1551
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:19,392
You act like everybody's so stupid
for not being a merciless asshole like you.

1552
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:21,765
- I'm the asshole?
- I mean, you're both kind of assholes.

1553
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:23,347
- Stay out of this.
- Seriously.

1554
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,607
Maybe you're the asshole, Alice.

1555
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:26,766
Oh, shit.

1556
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:28,352
Excuse me, bitch?

1557
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:31,316
I'm a fucking sweetheart.

1558
01:13:32,283 --> 01:13:35,776
Well, then why do you
insist on calling me Kiwi

1559
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:38,032
even though I told you
it was culturally insensitive?

1560
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:42,332
And why did you feel the need
to reach over and try to undo my seat belt

1561
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:43,954
in the taxicab on the way here?

1562
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,869
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah.

1563
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,871
That's an American bit.

1564
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:51,008
We do it as a joke. Okay?
We all do it. Right?

1565
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:52,421
Come on, say it.

1566
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:55,845
- Alice!
- Oh, my God, stop it, please.

1567
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:57,881
It's bad enough without you two going at it.

1568
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:00,308
And I thought your bridal shower
was a nightmare.

1569
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:02,511
What are you talking about?
She didn't have a bridal shower.

1570
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:04,479
No, she didn't.

1571
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:10,269
You had a bridal shower?

1572
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:13,738
Well, not really. I mean...

1573
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:17,197
It was, like, work friends.
It wasn't a big deal.

1574
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:18,406
But Blair went?

1575
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:20,240
It wasn't even open bar.

1576
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,159
What? It wasn't.

1577
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:24,700
How could you not invite me?

1578
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,164
Alice, please. Please, can we drop it?

1579
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:30,835
Please. I'm telling you, it was just...
It was for Peter's family.

1580
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:32,757
- It wasn't a big deal, man.
- Peter.

1581
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:35,048
He is so annoying.

1582
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:36,845
And I know why he doesn't like me.

1583
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:39,927
'Cause he's, like, so freaking jealous.

1584
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:42,259
Peter is not jealous of you.

1585
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:45,767
Well, then, why would you not invite
your best friend to your bridal shower?

1586
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:48,519
- Oh, my God, you really want to know why?
- Yes! I do!

1587
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:50,566
Because I knew that if I invited you,

1588
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,770
you wouldn't let me talk to anybody else.
That's why.

1589
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:55,231
Okay? You monopolize my time

1590
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:59,735
and then you make me feel guilty about not
spending time with you. How can I win?

1591
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:00,910
Are you kidding me?

1592
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,489
I do not monopolize your time, Jess!

1593
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:04,827
I just try to make the most of it,

1594
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:06,783
'cause you don't even make
an effort to see me anymore.

1595
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:09,002
- That's not true!
- It is true.

1596
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:10,624
It is.

1597
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:13,081
I'm sorry, but you are always at work,

1598
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,341
or you're making plans with Peter.

1599
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:20,256
Or you're Skyping with other people.
I can't do your stupid fucking accent.

1600
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:22,720
- No, you can't.
- Yes, yes.

1601
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:26,144
We're not in college anymore,
and things do change.

1602
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,517
The only thing that's changed is you.

1603
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,310
You've become obsessed

1604
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:34,445
with your perfect new life
and your campaign and you ditched me.

1605
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:38,236
I am sorry that I don't want to talk about

1606
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:40,282
the time that we got drunk

1607
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,736
at O'Flaherty's 10 years ago!

1608
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:44,279
Well, you know what?

1609
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:47,290
I guess I never should have planned
such a nice weekend for you.

1610
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:50,084
You know, you... God, you are so ungrateful.

1611
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:52,796
- Did you just say I was ungrateful?
- Yes!

1612
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:54,623
You're an ungrateful person.

1613
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:57,467
You didn't plan this weekend for me.

1614
01:15:57,553 --> 01:16:00,011
You planned this weekend for yourself,

1615
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:02,514
so that you could post a bunch of photos

1616
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,468
and not make your life seem so sad!

1617
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:12,686
I'm sorry, Jess.

1618
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,072
I'll leave you...

1619
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:20,982
I'll leave you alone from now on.

1620
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:23,364
Alice.

1621
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:26,700
Alice.

1622
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:32,874
Jess, that was really harsh.

1623
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:35,459
Oh, my God, I can't.
I can't with the guilt. Please.

1624
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:38,466
I can't with any of this anymore.

1625
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:40,502
Jess, come on, dude.

1626
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:45,512
No. All we have done all night
is make this situation worse, okay?

1627
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:48,093
We are turning ourselves in
and that's the end.

1628
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,846
Now, I'm going upstairs
to wipe this shit off my face,

1629
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,023
so I can at least look cute for my mug shot.

1630
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:58,611
And self-waxing is not weird.

1631
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:02,733
I don't appreciate
your body-hair-removal shaming.

1632
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:06,327
Shame on you! And you!

1633
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:09,577
You've been fine.

1634
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:21,042
Did you hear that? What is that?

1635
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:24,220
- What is that?
- Where is it?

1636
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:26,177
Where's it coming from?

1637
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:32,604
- Not these pillows.
- Fuck. No.

1638
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,475
Fuck, it's his phone.

1639
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,439
- Someone is looking for this guy.
- Oh, my God.

1640
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:39,861
- Turn it off.
- I'm trying!

1641
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:41,938
- What's going on?
- Stop! Oh, my God.

1642
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:45,859
Someone is trying to track the stripper's
phone and it looks like they're...

1643
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,412
Here.

1644
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:57,625
- Hello?
- Miami PD.

1645
01:17:58,215 --> 01:17:59,672
Have you seen this man?

1646
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:01,917
Shit.

1647
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:04,844
We tracked his phone to this house.

1648
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,171
We know he's in there.

1649
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:10,092
It's over.

1650
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:12,055
The jig is up.

1651
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:18,604
Hey.

1652
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,152
He's dead.

1653
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:53,350
You ladies are lucky.

1654
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:55,804
This man is very dangerous.

1655
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:58,273
This guy robbed a jewelry store
and killed a security guard.

1656
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:00,813
- Lot of people looking for him.
- Oh, my God. What?

1657
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:02,360
Yeah. He was on the run.

1658
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:03,937
Probably came here looking for cover.

1659
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:06,065
Sir, I'm sorry.

1660
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:09,321
Foreigner here. Just sort of want
to be clear on the local law.

1661
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:10,822
So, are we

1662
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:13,822
sort of, like, no longer in trouble?

1663
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:16,825
Sounds like self-defense to me, right?

1664
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:18,375
Yeah, no, DA's not gonna want to

1665
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:20,499
press any charges on something like this.
You're good.

1666
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:22,755
- Oh, my God.
- No, you're kidding.

1667
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:25,379
- Oh, my God!
- Are you shitting me?

1668
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:27,256
Oh, my God!

1669
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:29,884
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

1670
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:36,061
We're heroes! We're heroes.
We're American heroes.

1671
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:38,012
- Thank you, universe.
- Jesus!

1672
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:44,186
We killed a guy! And it was right!

1673
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:46,692
We were right to kill him!

1674
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,027
Fuck, yeah!

1675
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:53,487
Jess.

1676
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:55,864
Hey, Jess. We're not going to jail.

1677
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:59,872
I still might be, for unrelated things,
but you're not, you're safe.

1678
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,037
Jess?

1679
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:06,712
You should've seen us at the beginning.
We were like Squabble City.

1680
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:07,883
We didn't like each other.

1681
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,678
Now I can't get her away from me.
And I don't want to.

1682
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:12,676
Did he happen to mention the diamonds?

1683
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,468
No, I think I would have remembered that.
He didn't say much of anything.

1684
01:20:17,438 --> 01:20:21,523
Ladies, it's really important
that you try to remember any details.

1685
01:20:21,692 --> 01:20:23,274
He was cis male.

1686
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:28,279
Looked like he could, like,
wash his car as a hobby activity.

1687
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:31,817
- Okay.
- And he did have this, like, deep "V."

1688
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:36,246
Sort of like two large snakes
pointing down to a penis.

1689
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,031
This is a big house.

1690
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:39,915
Any place he might've been
able to stash something?

1691
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:44,454
Well, we did clean the entire house
and never came across his coat or phone,

1692
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:45,834
so it's definitely a possibility.

1693
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:47,085
Tampon!

1694
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:48,712
- What?
- Blair.

1695
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:51,545
- What?
- I need a tampon.

1696
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:53,804
I thought you use David cups.

1697
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:55,465
- Yeah.
- No, never.

1698
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:59,303
Fuck off. Only tampons, the best of tampons!

1699
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:01,353
You took them from us.

1700
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:04,103
- What?
- And locked them in there,

1701
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:06,851
- and you have the key.
- What are you talking about?

1702
01:21:06,945 --> 01:21:09,187
I didn't lock away our tampons.
I locked away our...

1703
01:21:12,242 --> 01:21:14,950
Are we on the same page, Blair?

1704
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:16,907
- Yes.
- Yo, yo.

1705
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:18,951
Lady, you want to get your
friend a tampon or whatever?

1706
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:23,326
Okay. One tampon coming up.

1707
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:26,124
Just be right back with that.

1708
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:28,169
Well, I'm not on my period.

1709
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,208
It's good to know. Thanks.

1710
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:35,547
Key.

1711
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:37,932
Shit. Shit.

1712
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:47,438
Quiet, be quiet, be quiet.
I just need to get my phone, okay?

1713
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:48,981
- What the fuck is that?
- What's that?

1714
01:21:49,071 --> 01:21:50,187
Nothing. It's... I don't know.

1715
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:53,277
- What the fuck was that?
- This guy, it's another thing.

1716
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:55,070
- There's more people here?
- The real stripper.

1717
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,901
- Yeah. That's the real stripper in there.
- The actual guy...

1718
01:21:58,038 --> 01:22:00,121
- I just need to get to my phone.
- Get back! Get back!

1719
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:03,500
- I will not be your drug mule!
- What? Stop. Stop. Stop.

1720
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:05,334
- You better get back. Yeah.
- Stop.

1721
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:09,206
<i>Breaking news and some
updated information for everybody.</i>

1722
01:22:09,299 --> 01:22:11,712
<i>These assailants are armed
and they're dangerous.</i>

1723
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:13,756
- No, it's nothing, that's...
- <i>So if you're inside your home,</i>

1724
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:15,758
<i>make sure your windows
and your doors are locked.</i>

1725
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:18,928
- Hey, blondie! Come here!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1726
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:23,553
- The tampon.
- Yeah, I know.

1727
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,354
That's what I was... I was using the code.

1728
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:27,606
- I just want to get my real estate license!
- Shut up.

1729
01:22:27,985 --> 01:22:29,226
Freeze!

1730
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:31,482
Shut the fuck up! Don't move!

1731
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:34,860
What the hell's going on here? Come on.
Let's go, move it. Let's go, tough guy.

1732
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:39,823
Everyone in America really does have a gun!

1733
01:22:40,497 --> 01:22:42,534
Let's go! Come on. You, too. Move it.

1734
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:45,621
- Oh, my God.
- Playtime's over.

1735
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:47,668
- We want those fucking diamonds now.
- Look.

1736
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,587
I know you're mad at the 1%.

1737
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:52,128
- I am, too.
- What? Shut up!

1738
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:54,675
- Tie them up now.
- Let's go!

1739
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:17,948
<i>Jess,</i>

1740
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:21,153
<i>when I was growing up,
I didn't really have many friends.</i>

1741
01:23:21,455 --> 01:23:24,289
<i>And when I left for college,
my mom was worried about me.</i>

1742
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:25,869
<i>And so was I.</i>

1743
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:28,372
<i>But then we met,
and the first night we went out,</i>

1744
01:23:28,462 --> 01:23:30,328
<i>you didn't introduce me
to people as your roommate,</i>

1745
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:32,209
<i>you introduced me as your friend.</i>

1746
01:23:32,299 --> 01:23:34,416
<i>And I knew everything was gonna be okay.</i>

1747
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:36,212
<i>When I went home that summer</i>

1748
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:38,462
<i>and I showed my mom
the photos of us hanging out,</i>

1749
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:40,421
<i>she was so happy.</i>

1750
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:44,558
<i>She doesn't always recognize me anymore,
but when I show her those old photos,</i>

1751
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:47,888
<i>she says to me,
"That's my daughter with all her friends."</i>

1752
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:50,181
<i>That's how she remembers me.</i>

1753
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:51,978
<i>Thanks to you.</i>

1754
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:54,777
<i>I can't wait to show her
all the photos from this weekend.</i>

1755
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,614
<i>You were there for me,
and I will always be here for you.</i>

1756
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:00,445
<i>Love, Alice.</i>

1757
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:04,655
<i>P.S. There are some wet wipes in here,
because I ordered an ice cream cake</i>

1758
01:24:04,748 --> 01:24:07,035
<i>and I know you have issues with dairy.</i>

1759
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:08,661
<i>Smiliest face.</i>

1760
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:18,172
- Come here. Let's go. Come here.
- They found me on Craigslist.

1761
01:24:18,262 --> 01:24:20,174
I'm not even with them!

1762
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:21,971
God damn it.

1763
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:24,383
Shit.

1764
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:26,471
Jay double-crossed us,

1765
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:28,599
and he took off with our score.

1766
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,430
So, tell me,

1767
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:33,103
- where'd he put it?
- I told you, we don't know.

1768
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:38,025
Sir, I could wire you $50,000 right now
if you just let us go, okay?

1769
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:39,734
50,000 what?

1770
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:42,241
There's over $2 million
worth of diamonds in this house,

1771
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:43,738
and I am going to find them.

1772
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:46,158
You shoot anyone who moves.

1773
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:48,664
- Oh, my God.
- Please.

1774
01:25:25,412 --> 01:25:26,619
Fuck!

1775
01:25:26,747 --> 01:25:28,409
Damn it! Fuck!

1776
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:32,663
Don't make a fucking sound
or I will kill you.

1777
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,006
What?

1778
01:25:43,347 --> 01:25:45,009
Handcuff yourself to the sink.

1779
01:25:45,349 --> 01:25:47,136
- Fuck you.
- Now.

1780
01:25:48,727 --> 01:25:50,093
Okay. Okay.

1781
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:06,071
What the fuck?

1782
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:18,421
No...

1783
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:28,385
You don't know anything?
Well, that smells like bullshit.

1784
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,216
Hurry up, man!

1785
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:32,427
Do I look stupid to you?

1786
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:36,355
You expect me to believe
that you killed Jay by accident?

1787
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:39,021
That's a bad accident.

1788
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:41,443
It's a big fucking accident.

1789
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:47,279
I am about to lose my fucking shit.

1790
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:50,533
Jay's dead, and you expect me to believe
that you guys don't know anything?

1791
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:53,077
New plan. You're gonna watch each other die,

1792
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:54,828
until one of you opens your fucking mouth!

1793
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,497
- And I'm gonna start with you.
- No!

1794
01:26:57,838 --> 01:26:59,704
- Oh, God.
- I love you, Frankie.

1795
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:01,709
I love you, too.

1796
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:08,796
Jess! Jess!

1797
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:10,969
Yes!

1798
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:16,888
- Not her beautiful face!
- Come on, Jess!

1799
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:23,944
- You perv!
- Come on.

1800
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:26,652
No, hey, hey, hey!

1801
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:28,695
You guys! The gun!

1802
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:32,286
Shimmy. Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.

1803
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:37,950
Okay. Okay.

1804
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:42,587
- Right there.
- Okay. Yeah.

1805
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:43,835
- One.
- Two.

1806
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:45,216
- Three!
- Okay.

1807
01:27:45,302 --> 01:27:46,838
Oh, God. Squat.

1808
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:49,216
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Do you have it?

1809
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:50,422
Yes.

1810
01:27:56,605 --> 01:27:57,812
Point me in his direction.

1811
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:05,194
I don't have a shot! Your leg is in the way!

1812
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:07,484
- No, no. Please.
- Up!

1813
01:28:07,574 --> 01:28:08,906
No, please.

1814
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:13,369
I shot a guy!

1815
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:16,080
- Yes!
- I killed another person.

1816
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,616
You fucking...

1817
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:20,497
Yes!

1818
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,297
Oh, my God, you guys!

1819
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:27,420
That was awesome.

1820
01:28:27,511 --> 01:28:29,252
- Alice, I'm so sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

1821
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:31,963
No. I said things that I didn't mean.

1822
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:34,599
I think it was just
the stress of killing somebody

1823
01:28:34,684 --> 01:28:36,516
and then trying to dispose of his body.

1824
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:38,139
- Wait, what?
- Totally.

1825
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:39,721
- That's a hard thing.
- Yeah, you're right.

1826
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:41,059
I have changed.

1827
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:43,190
I thought that I was
making people's lives better,

1828
01:28:43,276 --> 01:28:46,235
but I forgot about the people that
make my life better, and that's you guys.

1829
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:48,613
- And I love you, and I'm sorry.
- We love you, too.

1830
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:49,734
- We love you, too.
- We love you.

1831
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:51,987
- We love you, Jess!
- I'm sorry, too.

1832
01:28:52,244 --> 01:28:54,201
And you know what? I know that I'm a lot.

1833
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:57,030
And you were right,
I need to stop living in the past

1834
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:59,407
- and get a hobby, you know?
- Well, it could help, right?

1835
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:01,663
Next time we see each other,
we can make new memories

1836
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:03,915
instead of just talking about the old ones.

1837
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:05,917
These zip ties are really starting to hurt.

1838
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:07,589
And I'm sorry about Peter, okay?

1839
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:10,293
He does not suck.
You should totally marry him.

1840
01:29:10,387 --> 01:29:12,344
- Well, I will.
- Good. You should.

1841
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:15,173
I mean, I had a sex dream about him,
and I didn't even tell you.

1842
01:29:15,267 --> 01:29:16,474
No, you actually did tell me.

1843
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,517
- You told everybody.
- You started a group text.

1844
01:29:18,812 --> 01:29:20,223
It started with him brushing my hair...

1845
01:29:20,313 --> 01:29:21,599
You know what? I'm gonna untie you guys now.

1846
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:22,851
- Awesome.
- Yeah. Okay, great.

1847
01:29:22,983 --> 01:29:24,565
- Here, give me the gun.
- It was morning...

1848
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:26,108
Drop the gun!

1849
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:28,232
- Drop it.
- Damn it.

1850
01:29:30,574 --> 01:29:33,942
The keys were taped to the handcuffs,
you fucking idiot.

1851
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:36,864
You're all dead. All of you.

1852
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:38,742
- No. No, Jess.
- Yeah.

1853
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:41,161
Really? Come on. Whatever.

1854
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,621
What? What? What?

1855
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:48,623
What?

1856
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:54,841
- Oh, my God!
- Is that Peter?

1857
01:29:59,185 --> 01:30:00,676
Oh, my God. Is he...

1858
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,687
- Peter!
- You guys, what's happening back there?

1859
01:30:03,773 --> 01:30:04,763
I can't see.

1860
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:07,809
Peter? Peter.

1861
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:09,606
Peter.

1862
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:11,611
- Jess.
- Are you okay?

1863
01:30:12,574 --> 01:30:14,361
Do you not like my dick?

1864
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,196
What?

1865
01:30:16,328 --> 01:30:18,160
Does it bend weird
when it gets hard, or, like...

1866
01:30:18,455 --> 01:30:20,913
- I don't know, is it...
- What? No, I love it.

1867
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:22,740
So, you still want to get married?

1868
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:27,416
Yes. More than ever I want to get married.
I love you.

1869
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:29,873
I want that.

1870
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:32,333
Peter...

1871
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:35,587
Let's just get married.
Let's get married this weekend.

1872
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,262
Well, what about the campaign?
Didn't you want to wait

1873
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:38,556
till after the election, and...

1874
01:30:38,642 --> 01:30:41,385
I don't want to wait.
Everyone I love is right here.

1875
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:43,056
That's all that matters.

1876
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:46,306
- What about your parents?
- My parents aren't gonna care. They eloped.

1877
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:49,191
I mean, my mom did say
to lock that down as soon as possible.

1878
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:51,644
- She did?
- She loves you.

1879
01:30:52,405 --> 01:30:54,317
- I love you. Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

1880
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:55,985
Yes!

1881
01:30:56,618 --> 01:30:58,234
I have the perfect place.

1882
01:31:01,623 --> 01:31:05,458
Do you, Jessica,
take Peter to be your husband?

1883
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:07,243
I do.

1884
01:31:07,837 --> 01:31:11,797
And do you, Peter,
take Jessica to be your wife?

1885
01:31:12,258 --> 01:31:13,624
I definitely do.

1886
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:18,845
Now, by the power vested in me

1887
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:22,717
by GetOrdainedNow.net,

1888
01:31:23,103 --> 01:31:25,095
I pronounce you husband and wife.

1889
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:26,850
You may kiss the groom.

1890
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:35,150
So glad I didn't sell our passes
to the foam party.

1891
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:36,230
- Yeah!
- Right?

1892
01:31:48,086 --> 01:31:49,998
So, you guys are just not in trouble?

1893
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:52,546
No, we're, like, completely free.

1894
01:31:53,133 --> 01:31:56,547
We've committed what in Florida
is known as a "good murder."

1895
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:58,757
That's a direct quote from the Miami PD.

1896
01:31:58,847 --> 01:32:04,013
So, not only do we not have to go to jail,
but we got a sick coupon

1897
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:06,059
to Romano's Macaroni Grill.

1898
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:09,013
- Do you want to dance, Pippa?
- Yeah, okay.

1899
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:11,144
But call me Kiwi, okay?

1900
01:32:11,276 --> 01:32:12,767
All my best friends do.

1901
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:17,980
- Hey.
- Hi.

1902
01:32:18,074 --> 01:32:20,111
Can I get you a drink?

1903
01:32:21,745 --> 01:32:22,781
No.

1904
01:32:23,163 --> 01:32:25,450
'Cause I'm on a date with someone else, so...

1905
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:28,203
- Hey.
- Hot.

1906
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:30,122
You're a hot guy. Cool.

1907
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:35,171
Here you go.

1908
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:38,000
Oh, my God.

1909
01:32:39,012 --> 01:32:41,755
Has anyone ever told you
how beautiful your feet are?

1910
01:32:43,892 --> 01:32:45,633
No one's ever said that to me before.

1911
01:32:46,269 --> 01:32:48,431
You should've been told that a million times.

1912
01:32:49,856 --> 01:32:51,472
Do you want to...

1913
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:52,727
- Fuck?
- Fuck?

1914
01:32:54,152 --> 01:32:55,188
Hey.

1915
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:57,065
Keep it moving. We're a thing.

1916
01:32:58,531 --> 01:32:59,863
Love wins.

1917
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:01,986
What'd you just say?

1918
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:05,403
I don't know.
I mean, who knows if it will work out?

1919
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:08,080
And I don't know how you're gonna get to
New York. I guess hitchhike, but...

1920
01:33:08,374 --> 01:33:10,707
I already have my bags packed,
actually, so...

1921
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:13,794
Well, just 'cause I'm between places...

1922
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:15,963
Shut up.

1923
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:20,459
Yeah, yeah.

1924
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:22,503
Okay. Yeah.

1925
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:24,008
Babe. It's for you.

1926
01:33:25,183 --> 01:33:27,049
- Hello?
- Jess, it's me.

1927
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:30,227
That story about you and your friends
taking out those criminals is everywhere!

1928
01:33:30,313 --> 01:33:32,475
Okay? We're getting donations and volunteers.

1929
01:33:32,565 --> 01:33:35,524
- <i>What?</i>
- Jess, you're gonna win this thing.

1930
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,442
Are you serious? That's amazing.

1931
01:33:37,654 --> 01:33:39,441
Yeah, we're getting a ton of media requests.

1932
01:33:39,531 --> 01:33:41,523
Okay, <i>Good Morning America, Ellen.</i>

1933
01:33:41,825 --> 01:33:45,159
<i>Okay, you have to get back here right now.
I'm gonna get you out on the next flight.</i>

1934
01:33:45,245 --> 01:33:46,702
<i>Do you prefer window or aisle?</i>

1935
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:48,700
<i>I'm more of a middle seat guy myself, but...</i>

1936
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,827
You know what? I'm actually getting married.

1937
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:53,409
But I'll be there first thing Monday morning.

1938
01:33:53,503 --> 01:33:55,870
<i>You're getting married?
Jess, I'm in love with you.</i>

1939
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:58,380
- Take a picture of us?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1940
01:33:58,466 --> 01:33:59,582
Cool!

1941
01:34:00,718 --> 01:34:02,505
- I love you guys.
- We love you.

1942
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:04,257
Three.

1943
01:34:06,307 --> 01:34:07,639
Can I see?

1944
01:34:09,561 --> 01:34:11,302
- No.
- My arm looks too thick.

1945
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:14,555
- Another one?
- One more.

1946
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:15,856
Okay, okay, okay.

1947
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:21,774
- I love it.
- That, I love.

1948
01:34:21,948 --> 01:34:24,486
- Alice, you can tag me.
- Finally.

1949
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:08,253
<i>Congratulations to State Senator Jess Thayer!</i>

1950
01:36:09,347 --> 01:36:10,554
Thank you.

1951
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:12,674
<i>My number one boss bitch!</i>

1952
01:36:15,728 --> 01:36:19,221
<i>And now to celebrate her win,
we have a special request.</i>

1953
01:36:19,482 --> 01:36:20,518
Me?

1954
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:25,106
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

1955
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:27,571
<i>I actually have a surprise for all of you.</i>

1956
01:36:28,908 --> 01:36:30,615
<i>I've written a song</i>

1957
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:34,278
<i>that I hope can sort of encapsulate</i>

1958
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:37,577
<i>the bond of friendship that we all have.</i>

1959
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:40,288
<i>And so, I want to play it for you now.</i>

1960
01:36:41,921 --> 01:36:45,130
<i>Sometimes</i>

1961
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:48,084
<i>You kill a man</i>

1962
01:36:49,178 --> 01:36:53,172
<i>When he's taking off his clothes for you</i>

1963
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:57,347
<i>You kill a man</i>

1964
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:01,347
<i>You kill him with your friends</i>

1965
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:03,106
<i>And he dies</i>

1966
01:37:07,447 --> 01:37:08,563
Jesus, it's good.

1967
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:10,864
<i>Other times</i>

1968
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:14,826
<i>When you kill a man</i>

1969
01:37:15,163 --> 01:37:20,500
<i>You need to toss his body in the ocean</i>

1970
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:23,244
<i>And you don't care</i>

1971
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:28,966
<i>'Cause your friends are there by your side</i>

1972
01:37:30,553 --> 01:37:32,135
<i>They make it fun</i>

1973
01:37:33,639 --> 01:37:36,632
<i>I love you, girls</i>

1974
01:37:36,976 --> 01:37:38,057
I love you, Pippa!

1975
01:37:38,144 --> 01:37:40,136
<i>We killed a man</i>

1976
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:42,930
<i>We made a plan</i>

1977
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:45,812
<i>You are my friends</i>

1978
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:49,065
<i>And I'll never forget</i>

1979
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:52,280
<i>This bachelorette</i>

1980

<i>This bachelorette</i>

1981
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:00,952
That's the end.

1982
01:39:14,824 --> 01:39:16,941
Do you guys want to come up?

1983
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:18,950
No, no, no. Don't come up. Don't come up.

1984
01:39:19,036 --> 01:39:20,402
'Cause I got to do stuff.

1985
01:39:21,873 --> 01:39:24,616
So, I will see you at Nussbaum's at 10:00.

1986
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:26,241
No, no. 12:30.

1987
01:39:26,586 --> 01:39:28,293
- Okay.
- I don't want to get up.

1988
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:30,621
Okay, you guys, go. Go, go, go.

1989
01:39:30,882 --> 01:39:32,794
We want to make sure that you get in okay.

1990
01:39:32,884 --> 01:39:35,342
- You're obsessed with me.
- We love you.

1991
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:36,836
I love you.

1992
01:39:46,564 --> 01:39:47,805
Bullshit.

1993
01:39:53,321 --> 01:39:54,482
Yes!
