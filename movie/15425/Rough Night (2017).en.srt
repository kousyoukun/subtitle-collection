00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:49,478
The business of pleasure?

311
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:51,397
Oh, bachelorette weekend.

312
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,691
- Jess is getting married.
- Ah.

313
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:55,526
- Congratulations!
- JESS: Thank you.

314
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,861
This marriage, will it be open?

315
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,113
You know, we haven't discussed it.

316
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:01,115
But, probably closed. Yeah.

317
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,992
Tightly, tightly closed.

318
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,786
Lea, does she not remind you

319
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,038
of our French girl from Turks and Caicos?

320
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:10,541
- Oh.
- She does.

321
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,418
Thank you. Thanks.

322
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:16,046
Well, we're gonna try to keep it down.

323
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,007
- BLAIR: Mmm-hmm.
- Oh, well, we'll try not to.

324
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,550
- ALICE: Oh.
- (LAUGHTER)

325
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:20,759
Ah! Yes!

326
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:21,886
- They're serious.
- Go. Go, go, downstairs.

327
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,430
She is delicious.

328
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:26,891
- I want that.
- Mmm.

329

(WOMEN LAUGHING)

330
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,563
Ooh, yes.

331
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:35,483
Oh, <i>Real World,</i> baby! Miami!

332
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:38,319
Ew. This house represents everything I hate.

333
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:39,987
I'm gonna go take a protest dump.

334
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,031
I call the room next to Jess! Ah.

335
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:43,866
Oh, I think that room has bunk beds,

336
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,075
so you're gonna have to share with Pippa.

337
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:46,535
Uh, who that?

338
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,413
Pippa, my Australian friend
from semester abroad.

339
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:51,207
She's been CC'd on, like, every single email.

340
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,917
Oh, right.

341
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,877
Well, if my snoring bothers her,
she can take the couch.

342
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,879
Or she can just start on the couch
and we'll go from there.

343
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,589
We'll figure it out. She'll start on the couch.

344
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,091
- JESS: Blair.
- What?

345
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:04,345
Can you be careful with the red wine
on the white carpet, please?

346
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,555
My biggest and only donor

347
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,474
generously lent us this house
for the weekend.

348
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,268
- So, please be careful.
- Okay.

349
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:13,854
I'm telling you, she's got bigger problems
than a wine stain

350
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:16,440
if she wants to sell this place
for 3.4 in this market.

351
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:18,734
- How do you know that?
- Zillow.

352
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,903
- I Zillow everybody.
- Really?

353
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:23,113
Like, do you know
how much my house is worth?

354
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,824
- Mmm-hmm.
- ALICE: Okay, <i>atención.</i>

00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:28,953
Let me get your attention.

357
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,371
We got it all.

00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:33,082
Bride-to-be bathrobe for our lovely Jess,

359
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:37,545
penis straws, penis sunglasses,
penis sprinkles, penis gum,

360
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,547
penis hats, penis pasta.

361
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,799
And yes, I did get a little
drunk and ate some of that dry.

362
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,385
- Don't judge.
- No judgment.

363
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,971
Also, I wrote you a card.
But don't read it now, read it later.

364
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:48,931
- Thanks, Alice.
- Yeah.

Ooh, your donor is a freak, Jess.

373
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:07,199
Please. She rents this house out.

374
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:09,076
I'm sure somebody else
left it here accidentally.

375
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,745
And installed a load-bearing beam
to support it accidentally.

376
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,080
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, Jess.

377
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,748
I want to audition some dresses for tonight.

- I'm not. I'm not.

- I'm gonna smack your face.

for the first time, this is so exciting.

- Nice to meet you.

This is so weird, you guys,
because it's sort of like

you're all Jess's best friends,
I'm Jess's best friend.

00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:30,616
And so it's sort of like
we're all already best friends, you know?

417
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:33,035
Well, it's a little different for us,
sorry to interrupt,

418
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:35,996
but, uh, Jess and I were
freshman year roommates,

419
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,415
so it's kind of like family. Eh.

420
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,835
- I know, I know.
- Um, okay, I'm going to grab a chair.

Feel free to gel.

PIPPA: Just gonna sit on my suitcase here.

423
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:47,216
Ooh. I'm famished.

424
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:49,218
- Do you want my leftovers?
- Oh, shoot. We just finished.

425
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:50,886
No, I was gonna wrap that up
and take it to go.

426
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,429
I think we're done. Check, please!

427
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:56,725
It's okay. I'm just gonna take
some of this bread from the bread basket.

428
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:59,395
When you got bread and Vegemite,
you got yourself a meal.

429
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:00,979
What? Vegemite?

430
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,315
They should call you cuckoos
instead of Kiwis.

431
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,525
Am I right?

- Alice.
- Oh, my God.

433
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:07,236
That's funny on several levels,

434
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,447
because I'm actually Australian
and a Kiwi is a New Zealander.

435
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,492
There's nothing wrong with being a Kiwi,
we all love Kiwis,

436
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,704
but, um, it's sort of like calling
a Chinese person Japanese.

437
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:18,539
It's just sort of like, little bit racist

438
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,417
to not recognize the cultural
differences there, you know?

439

Oh, my gosh.

440
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,795
Eat me out. It's a fruit, Kiwi.

441
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,630
(LAUGHS) I'll take it.

00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,257
Pippa, what do you do?

443
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,343
Well, singer-songwriter is the dream.

444
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:33,262
Uh, party clown is the reality.

Gosh, I can't believe you're getting married.

457
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,916
Feels like just yesterday
you were showing me

458
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,794
how to hide that cat scratch on my face
with that cover-up.

459
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:07,129
I remember that.

460

And even though we don't
get to see you all the time

461
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:12,050
because you're so busy
with Peter and the campaign

462
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:15,220
and changing your Brita filters
or whatever it is you white people do,

- What?
- No, this guy came over.

930
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:44,060
He was a stripper, like, a prostitute.

931
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:45,186
- A prostitute?
<i>- And we were drunk,</i>

932
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:47,730
and coked up, and I don't know what to do.

933
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:48,981
About what? The wedding?

934
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:51,567
- (FRANTIC WHISPERING)
- Jess, do you still want to get married?

935
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:53,152
- You can't, you can't...
- JESS: No! (GASPS)

936
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,987
- Jess!
- (CLICK)

937
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,533
I can't believe you just did that.

938
00:35:58,616 --> 00:36:01,452
We can't talk to anybody
until we consult with a lawyer.

939
00:36:01,536 --> 00:36:02,703
She's right. You know what,

940
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:04,831
I'm collecting everyone's phones
until we know what the plan is.

941
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:06,541
- Agreed?
- Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

942
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:07,834
- Yes.
- Agreed.

943
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:08,918
- Mmm-hmm.
- Fine.

944
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:13,297
- Well, I have a game on it that relaxes me.
- Give it.

945
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:15,967
Thank you.

946
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:17,969
♪♪

947
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:20,930
Okay, so we got to get this burner phone
from a convenience store.

948
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,223
- Smart.
- Yeah, good idea.

949
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:23,516
Frankie and I can go.

950
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,684
- Great.
- ALICE: Um...

951
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:27,478
- Or, like, anybody else could go.
- BLAIR: Why?

952
00:36:27,562 --> 00:36:30,022
- Do we argue?
- We bicker. Yeah, we bicker.

953
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:32,525
- (CHUCKLES) It's true, but...
- No. I think that we debate,

954
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:34,402
which is a normal part of talking.

955
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:36,946
That's funny.
That's the same thing, debating and arguing.

956
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,364
- It's semantics.
- "Semantics."

957
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:40,449
Wow, I didn't realize
I was talking to a wordsmith.

958
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:42,118
- They used to be lovers, yeah?
- FRANKIE: Three syllables.

959
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:44,120
I'm a wordsmith 'cause
I read the news regularly.

960
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:45,371
- Is it that obvious?
- BLAIR: Oh, my God.

961
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:49,375
- I'm too busy shopping, right?
- I have a sort of a sense of these things.

962
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:52,753
- (OTHERS CONTINUE ARGUING)
- Also, she's been fixated on her nips.

963
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:54,714
Just because I don't use
Tom's of Maine deodorant, which,

964
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:55,882
by the way, does not work...

965
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:57,216
I don't use Tom's deodorant...

966
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,635
- It's kind of nasty to watch, isn't it?
- ...into my body.

967
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:02,513
PETER: Yeah, so, I call. She picks up.

968
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:04,223
- Uh-huh.
- She sounds very strange.

969
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:05,516
I know something's wrong immediately.

970
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,101
And then, finally, she admits it.

971
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:08,811
She says something really bad
happened with a prostitute.

972
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:10,980
- OTHERS: Ooh!
- That does not mean she cheated.

973
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:13,941
But if she was going to cheat,
this is when she would do it.

974
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,819
- Oh, God.
- Miami, bachelorette party.

975
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:18,738
- It's pretty classic.
- Mmm...

976
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:21,991
It's not cheating if it's
with a prostitute. Technically.

977
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:24,160
- TOBEY: What?
- What? Yes, it is.

978
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:26,621
Look, guys, we have
to have realistic attitudes

979
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:28,247
about sexual exclusivity.

980
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:31,000
Whatever. It doesn't even matter, because...

981
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,793
I asked her if she still wanted to get married.

982
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:34,921
She screamed "no" and then she hung up!

983
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:36,756
So, guess what, guys,

984
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,175
there's no wedding for you to go to,
so return your tuxes.

985
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:40,676
OTHERS: No!

986
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,511
- No. Hell, no.
- Fine, keep your tuxes,

987
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:43,846
but my wedding's off.

988
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:45,806
It's not a shock, right?

989
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:49,602
I mean, buddy, I love you,
you're one of my best friends,

990
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:52,229
but you're a six and she's a...

991
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:54,106
(TAKES BREATH) Twenty.

992
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,525
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- JOE: He can hear you.

993
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:58,569
Oh, I'm feeling... I'm feeling weak.

994
00:37:58,653 --> 00:38:00,196
- I'm feeling dizzy, I'm...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

995
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:02,198
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Oh, my God.

996
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:04,659
I knew I shouldn't date out of my league,
I knew it.

997
00:38:04,742 --> 00:38:07,078
When she first asked me out,
I thought it was a prank.

998
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:10,081
I could feel her pulling away,
but I thought it was work.

999
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:11,540
- (BELCHES) I'm gonna be sick.
- No, no, no.

1000
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:13,250
- Give him some Madeira.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1001
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:15,419
- Yeah.
- Peter, that's it. Just take a sip.

1002
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:17,463
- Chug-a-lug. Bup-bup-bup-bup.
- Oh, I'll get you a soft cheese!

1003
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:18,547
Yes!

1004
00:38:20,049 --> 00:38:21,467
FRANKIE: This is so stupid.

1005
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:25,221
Yeah, but this way no one can
definitively ID our face.

1006
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:27,264
FRANKIE: Old people. Perfect.

1007
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:31,060
Any brand is fine.

1008
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:32,520
What's that on your face?

1009
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:33,980
A detoxifying mud mask.

1010
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:36,148
Look, we need a burner phone, okay?

1011
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:40,152
- Here's some cash.
- Again, a burner phone,

1012
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:42,905
and you can find that behind the counter.

1013
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,740
- MAN: Okay. We heard you.
- Inside.

1014
00:38:44,824 --> 00:38:48,035
You baby boomers are so demanding.

1015
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,412
WOMAN: I know.

1016
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:51,747
- Jesus. Come on, Ma.
- I'm sick and tired of this shit.

1017
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,209
ALICE: I can't believe he's dead.

1018
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:59,755
- And it's, like, all my fault.
- No, no.

1019
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:02,717
It really is a tragedy, you know?

1020
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:08,347
He could have been a scientist
that was gonna cure cancer or something.

1021
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:11,934
- It's nice of you to say.
- Yeah.

1022
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:15,604
Guys, is he looking, like, straight at me?

1023
00:39:18,024 --> 00:39:19,525
- Oh, my God, he's...
- Yeah. Yeah.

1024
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:21,569
He's looking at me, right? (CRIES SOFTLY)

1025
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:22,862
PIPPA: Mmm-hmm.

1026
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:27,199
Hi, baby boy.

1027
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:29,702
Mummy Hubbard's here.

1028
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:31,871
She's gonna send you home.

1029
00:39:33,706 --> 00:39:35,207
Okay.

1030
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:36,625
Sleep now.

1031
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:39,920
- Oh, no. Jesus, no. No, no, no.
- (JESS GAGS)

1032
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:41,672
- Okay, why don't we...
- I don't like it, I don't like it,

1033
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:42,882
- I don't like it.
- Guys, I got it.

1034
00:39:43,257 --> 00:39:44,884
- I got it.
- JESS: I'm done.

1035
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:46,677
- I'm done.
- ALICE: There we go.

1036
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:48,471
He looks good, right?

1037
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:51,182
ALL: Totally.

1038
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,981
- PIPPA: Oh, my God, Jess. (LAUGHS)
- What?

1039
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:00,524
Look at this ring.

1040
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:02,943
It's even bigger in real life
than it is on Skype.

1041
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:04,653
- Yeah, he did a good job.
- Oh.

1042
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:06,363
You guys Skype?

1043
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:08,324
- Yes.
- Oh, do we?

1044
00:40:08,741 --> 00:40:09,825
Yes.

1045
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:14,371
It's really nice to just sort of,
you know, see the person

1046
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,499
when you're talking to them.

1047
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:18,459
- I didn't know that.
- Yes.

1048
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:19,877
You don't know Skype?

1049
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,046
Skype is a free video calling app.

1050
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:23,589
- You should...
- No, I know what Skype is.

1051
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:25,883
Jess, you said you couldn't
remember your password.

1052
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:29,178
Well, it is really hard to sign in.

1053
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:31,889
(BARKING)

1054
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:33,432
- Oh, shit!
- Shit!

1055
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:35,476
- Whose dog is that?
- Go away! Go away!

1056
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:37,186
- Go! Go, go.
- MAN: Charlie? Here, boy!

1057
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:39,522
- The owner is coming towards the house.
- Oh, God.

1058
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:41,524
No, no, no. You're being too loud.

1059
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:43,943
I can speak to animals,
we have a deep understanding,

1060
00:40:44,026 --> 00:40:45,069
- so I got this.
- MAN: Charlie?

1061
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:46,695
ALICE: Just go!
JESS: Okay, be careful, though.

1062
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:48,030
PIPPA: Okay.
MAN: Here, boy!

1063
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:50,324
Okay, Charlie. Come on.

1064
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:52,493
- Come on, come on.
- (VICIOUS GROWLING, LOUD CHOMP)

1065
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:54,203
PIPPA: Aah! Ow! Aah!
BOTH: Oh, shit!

1066
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:56,038
- Ow. Ow.
- (GROWLING)

1067
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:57,540
- MAN: Charlie!
- You stay. I'm bringing him to you.

1068
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:59,667
This is impossible, anybody can see
into the house from the beach.

1069
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,168
- This is crazy.
- I know.

1070
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:03,212
If someone reports it
before we do, we're dead.

1071
00:41:03,546 --> 00:41:06,048
Well, we just... We have
to get the body out of sight, that's all.

1072
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:07,800
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

1073
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:08,968
- Okay.
- ALICE: You all right?

1074
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:10,094
- You all right?
- Good.

1075
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:13,013
Oh, my God, Pip,
I can see all of his teeth marks.

1076
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:14,640
That looks really bad.

1077
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:16,475
No, no, no. This is...

1078
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:17,977
That's not... I'm good.

1079
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,770
Yeah, she's fine. Look at her in the eyes.

1080
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:22,398
Okay? So let's just get the body out of sight,

1081
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:24,775
and then we'll put him back
before we call the cops. Yeah?

1082
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:26,026
- Let's do it. Right?
- Yes.

1083
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,945
- Let's go! Okay!
- Let's do it.

1084
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:29,864
PIPPA: Hold the door. Hang on one sec.

1085
00:41:29,947 --> 00:41:31,657
ALICE: Got it.
JESS: There's two steps here. Hold on.

1086
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,033
- Yeah, we got it. Ow.
- ALICE: Oh, there's two steps.

1087
00:41:33,117 --> 00:41:34,118
(LOUD CRASH)

1088
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:35,661
PIPPA: Put him down.
ALICE: That was me.

1089
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,246
JESS: Can somebody turn the lights on?

1090
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,123
- PIPPA: I'll get it.
- Oh, there we go.

1091
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:40,332
- That's better.
- Oh, God!

1092
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:42,459
Shit! Alice, cover the body!

1093
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:43,878
Why? Why? Why?

1094
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:45,462
JESS: Pippa, what did you do?

1095
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:48,340
This is a poltergeist situation.

1096
00:41:48,424 --> 00:41:49,842
I'm not doing anything.

1097
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:51,468
- All right.
- There's got to be a fuse box.

1098
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,556
- Oh, God. There is a taxi.
- PIPPA: Oh, no, no.

1099
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:57,016
There is a taxi right here.

1100
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:59,560
No! No, no, no.

1101
00:42:00,144 --> 00:42:01,228
No, thank you.

1102
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:02,813
- Cover the body.
- Hide me. Hide me.

1103
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:04,481
- Balls!
- Jesus Christ.

1104
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:06,442
Find a quilt. Find a fucking quilt.

1105
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:08,652
- DRIVER: What the...
- Jesus!

1106
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:11,697
- Oh, no. My water broke! My water broke!
- What?

1107
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,948
No, no, I just peed.

1108
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,034
- PIPPA: I have no control over this.
- Pippa.

1109
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:17,536
Close, you fuck.

1110
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,247
- Here you go, sir. Thank you.
- Thought I peed. I didn't pee.

1111
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:22,124
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Thank you.

1112
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:24,877
- Safe home!
- What the fuck is going on in here?

1113
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,962
We're starting a garage band.
Do you guys play bass?

1114
00:42:27,046 --> 00:42:28,923
We're hiding a body.
What do you think we're doing?

1115
00:42:29,048 --> 00:42:30,925
BLAIR: Stop saying "body" so many times.

1116
00:42:31,008 --> 00:42:32,384
- Alice, what the hell are you doing, man?
- Sorry.

1117
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:33,844
- Come on.
- FRANKIE: God!

1118
00:42:33,928 --> 00:42:35,721
Lift him up with your legs.
Lift with your legs.

1119
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:38,265
JESS: I swear to God,
he's getting heavier every time.

1120
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:39,475
Just hold one second.

1121
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:40,893
- There's two stairs up here.
- No!

1122
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:42,853
- I got it.
- Let's take a break. Let's take a break.

1123
00:42:42,937 --> 00:42:43,979
Break, break, break.

1124
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:45,356
- ALICE: No, no, no.
- Okay.

1125
00:42:45,481 --> 00:42:47,107
- Okay.
- BLAIR: I am out of shape.

1126
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:49,485
- PIPPA: Really good.
- Quick question.

1127
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:51,487
Why are we moving the dead stripper?

1128
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:54,240
The whole house is made out of glass.

1129
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:57,117
This is impossible.
You can see in everywhere.

1130
00:42:57,618 --> 00:42:59,870
Where could we put him
that he's not gonna be seen?

1131
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:07,044
(SQUEAKING, CREAKING)

1132
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:13,592
BLAIR: (ON PHONE)
<i>So, what do you think, Uncle Jack?</i>

1133
00:43:13,676 --> 00:43:16,428
They could charge you
with involuntary manslaughter,

1134
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:17,888
but it's not that easy to prove.

1135
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:19,640
- Ah, thank God.
- Well, that's not bad.

1136
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:21,308
- That's okay.
- JACK: <i>Just don't touch the body</i>

1137
00:43:21,392 --> 00:43:23,936
<i>- or the scene, and you'll be fine.</i>
- What?

1138
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:26,146
Okay, so actually,
we have already moved him

1139
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,439
to a sex swing, Your Honor.

1140
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:28,816
What?

1141
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:32,778
I said, "Actually, we have already moved him
to a sex swing, Your Honor."

1142
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:33,988
<i>I heard you.</i>

1143
00:43:35,197 --> 00:43:37,116
You knowingly tampered with the scene,

1144
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:39,451
<i>which means you're guilty
of accessory after the fact,</i>

1145
00:43:39,535 --> 00:43:43,872
and they'll have a strong case
for involuntary manslaughter.

1146
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:45,624
Wait, what does that mean?

1147
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,668
<i>Up to 15 years in prison.</i>

1148
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:50,170
- What?
- Fifteen?

1149
00:43:50,254 --> 00:43:52,965
- ALICE: <i>Well, what can we do?</i>
- Are we on an open line here, girls?

1150
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:54,883
- It's a burner phone.
<i>- Good.</i>

1151
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,719
Like I told Rob Lowe,

1152
00:43:57,219 --> 00:44:00,889
if there's no body, there's no case.

1153
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,145
We can't just chop him up.

1154
00:44:06,812 --> 00:44:09,815
You know what?
I'll just tell the cops it was just me.

1155
00:44:10,232 --> 00:44:12,276
No, we all moved the body.

1156
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:14,320
It's a crime.

1157
00:44:14,403 --> 00:44:17,656
Well, yeah, but if we just,
like, explain the situation...

1158
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,700
FRANKIE: What are you talking about,
"Explain"?

1159
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:22,453
Last year, a guy in Tampa,
he threatened to kill his wife,

1160
00:44:22,536 --> 00:44:23,871
so she fired a warning shot,

1161
00:44:23,954 --> 00:44:26,081
and she went to jail for 20 years.

1162
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:29,418
This country
should be burned to the ground!

1163
00:44:31,587 --> 00:44:33,047
Shit.

1164
00:44:34,548 --> 00:44:36,592
I was so close. Peter.

1165
00:44:37,301 --> 00:44:38,761
My career.

1166
00:44:38,886 --> 00:44:40,429
It's all over, just like that.

1167
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:43,515
I'm gonna do real time.

1168
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:44,933
Maybe life.

1169
00:44:45,017 --> 00:44:46,477
You guys are gonna get off with a few years.

1170
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,438
I can't do any years.
I'm in the middle of a custody battle.

1171
00:44:49,772 --> 00:44:50,731
- What?
- What?

1172
00:44:50,814 --> 00:44:51,857
What?

1173
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:56,153
Malcolm and I separated six months ago.

1174
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:58,364
You didn't tell me.

1175
00:44:59,156 --> 00:45:01,075
Yeah, you've been a little preoccupied, Jess.

1176
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:03,702
Why didn't you tell me?

1177
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:06,163
I didn't need your judgment.

1178
00:45:06,455 --> 00:45:08,707
Blair, I would never judge you
for something like that.

1179
00:45:10,501 --> 00:45:13,420
Oh, my God, my students.

1180
00:45:13,504 --> 00:45:15,297
They idolize me.

1181
00:45:15,381 --> 00:45:18,550
They think I'm, like, the best fucking adult

1182
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:21,053
in the whole fucking world.

1183
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:22,554
They'll turn to crime.

1184
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:24,807
I can't go to jail.

1185
00:45:24,932 --> 00:45:26,767
I couldn't even make it
through the first episode

1186
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,143
of <i>Orange Is the New Black.</i>

1187
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:29,978
(CRYING) None of us can.

1188
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:32,231
(SNIFFLES) It's too soapy, right?

1189
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:35,234
No, I meant none of us can go to jail.
(SNIFFLES)

1190
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:36,485
PIPPA: Wait, you guys.

1191
00:45:36,777 --> 00:45:39,780
Even if we don't get charged
with this tampering with evidence thing,

1192
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:41,407
we don't know who this man is.

1193
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,242
His family could come seek revenge.

1194
00:45:43,325 --> 00:45:46,120
He could be part of a cartel
that's gonna cut off our toes

1195
00:45:46,203 --> 00:45:47,246
and stick them up our bums.

1196
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:48,330
BLAIR: She's right.

1197
00:45:48,497 --> 00:45:50,874
We'll have to look over our shoulders
for the rest of our lives.

1198
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:54,002
He did say that

1199
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:57,756
it would be hard to convict

1200
00:45:58,674 --> 00:46:00,843
with no body.

1201
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:04,388
I mean, it was an accident.

1202
00:46:04,638 --> 00:46:06,640
And he's not part
of an escort company, you know?

1203
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:08,517
So I don't think anybody knows he's here.

1204
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:10,894
Mmm-hmm.

1205
00:46:15,357 --> 00:46:16,692
We got to get rid of him.

1206
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:17,985
- We gotta, right?
- Yeah.

1207
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:19,194
- We do.
- We have to.

1208
00:46:19,278 --> 00:46:21,447
- I mean, we don't want to.
- No, of course we don't want to.

1209
00:46:21,572 --> 00:46:22,739
We didn't want to kill him.

1210
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:24,116
- We have no other option.
- But we have to.

1211
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:25,451
- Of course we have to.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1212
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:26,535
Must.

Don't leave a message.</i>

Okay. That's it. None of them are picking up.

1216
00:46:33,709 --> 00:46:35,169
That means something really bad happened.

1217
00:46:35,252 --> 00:46:39,006
Dude, this is, like, the third girlfriend
that's cheated on you.

1218

What is that? What's going on, buddy?

1219
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:43,635
Does your dick bend weird
when it gets hard?

No.

- JAKE: Doesn't matter.

1222

Let's get you on Tinder right now,
so you can start on a rebound.

1223
00:46:49,892 --> 00:46:52,561
- No, I don't want to be on Tinder, okay?
- PATRICK: Come on.

1224
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:55,189
You've gotten over other girls,
you can get over her.

Yeah, this isn't some girl, this is Jess.
I'm not gonna get over her, you know?

1226
00:46:59,276 --> 00:47:00,486
And I don't want to get over her.

1227
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:02,404
Then, this time, do something about it, Peter.

00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:08,285
You're right.

1230
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:10,996
You're right, I got to go to Miami,
and I got to win her back.

1231
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:13,499
- Yes, dude. Yes. Awesome.
- Okay, okay.

1232
00:47:13,582 --> 00:47:17,461
The first flight out of Charleston
gets in at 1Ø:Ø0 a.m. tomorrow morning.

1233
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:18,670
TOBEY: No.
JOE: Oh. There is a train

1234
00:47:18,754 --> 00:47:22,174
that gets there tomorrow afternoon
and there's room in the quiet car.

1235
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:24,426
Not quick enough. You got to sad astronaut.

1236
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:27,095
- What?
- Huh?

1237
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,139
He has to sad astronaut.

1238
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:30,724
- Okay, what is that?
- JAKE: That's nothing to me.

1239
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:32,684
- Sad astronaut?
- TOBEY: That news story?

1240
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:34,937
Okay. (EXHALES)

1241
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:37,606
Lisa Marie Nowak was an astronaut.

1242
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:42,110
And she was in love
with another astronaut named Will.

1243
00:47:42,736 --> 00:47:45,739
Now, Will cheated on Lisa
with some hottie Air Force captain.

1244
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:48,951
Lisa found out and was pissed.

1245
00:47:49,326 --> 00:47:51,787
So, Lisa decided to deal with it.

1246
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:55,541
Once and for all.
And she got a bunch of adult diapers,

1247
00:47:55,874 --> 00:47:57,209
so she wouldn't have to piss on the way,

1248
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:59,753
and she drove straight from
Houston to Orlando

1249
00:47:59,962 --> 00:48:04,132
to, like, kidnap the Air Force...
It's... The story gets dark quick.

1250
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:08,428
Point is, she used that crazy
astrophysicist brain

1251
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:10,556
to find the quickest way to Florida.

1252
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:14,268
- You... You want to get Jess back, right?
- Yeah.

1253
00:48:14,977 --> 00:48:17,771
Then you got to sad astronaut, bro.

1254
00:48:19,356 --> 00:48:21,149
