2
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:45,547
Woman, you know you're a woman

3
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,048
You got to be...

4
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:50,051
- There she is. Hey.
- Hi, guys.

5
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,182
All right, baby girl.
You go, baby girl.

6
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:54,222
You go, baby girl. You go, you go get it.

7
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:56,808
Yes!

8
00:00:57,308 --> 00:00:59,189
- You're my baby...
- Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba...

9
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:00,549
No, no, no, don't make it.

10
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:02,230
- Oh!
- Damn it!

11
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:04,566
Oh... Yes!

12
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:07,152
- Nope. I absolute...
- I got this. I got this.

13
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:08,782
- I absolutely can't do it.
- Come on, Jess!

14
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:10,989
But remember, this is
a stupid frat boy ritual, so...

15
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:12,243
Yeah, but kick their ass!

16
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:13,533
- Yeah, fuck 'em up!
- Hey.

17
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:14,579
- We're together.
- No.

18
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:16,453
Cool, cool, cool.

19
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:19,998
Yes.

20
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:23,042
Yeah, go, Jess!

21
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:25,545
Dude!

22
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:27,589
Oh, God. Oh, God, Jess.

23
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:29,841
Only two cups left.

24
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,343
No, there's one cup.
You're just seeing double.

25
00:01:32,677 --> 00:01:35,388
Oh, God! There's only one cups left.

26
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:37,310
- Oh, I can't do it. It's too much pressure.
- What?

27
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,808
- I can't do it, Jess.
- Look...

28
00:01:38,892 --> 00:01:40,643
- Look at me. Look at me.
- Mmm-hmm?

29
00:01:40,727 --> 00:01:42,562
You got us through
the Wendy's drive-through

30
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:44,647
when my car had no windshield
and three tires.

31
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:46,107
You can do anything.

32
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:47,779
Yeah, but everybody's watching me,

33
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:49,819
and I'm sweating like crazy.

34
00:01:49,903 --> 00:01:52,071
I look like a princess,
but I smell like a peasant.

35
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:54,449
Let's go, foot job girl!

36
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:58,203
Excuse me, she has a name! It's Alice.

37
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:01,998
And she's my best friend,
and she's good and kind.

38
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,291
Yeah!

39
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,586
Thank you, but I did jerk off
his roommate with my feet.

40
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:08,129
I... I know.

41
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:11,716
The key is, right foot
only for, like, a while.

42
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,719
- You know? Make him beg for...
- The left one. I know. Focus!

43
00:02:15,428 --> 00:02:20,099
If we win this, we will be the only girls
to ever win the Halloween tournament.

44
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:21,505
We've got to do this.

45
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:24,604
For womankind.

46
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:30,068
Stop making me horny, and shoot!

47
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:34,823
Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy...

48
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:46,212
We did it!
We did it! We did it!

49
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:48,336
- I want up! I want up! I want up!
- You deserve it.

50
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,420
You've earned it.

51
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:55,969
Here we go. All right. All right, yes!

52
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,638
I'm the king of the world!

53
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:00,932
Oh!

54
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,935
Oh. Again?

55
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,770
- Dude. Oh, God.
- Jess?

56
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:06,896
Are you all right?

57
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,816
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Dude. Come on. Come on.

58
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:12,944
- I'm fine, Mom.
- Oh, my God.

59
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,737
What happened?

60
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:18,244
Honestly, I don't even know
why we go to these stupid parties.

61
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:19,537
I just want to hang out with you guys.

62
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:20,914
- I know. I feel the same way.
- Yes!

63
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:23,663
Everyone else at this college
is sloppy and gross.

64
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:25,164
- Water.
- Wait, come here.

65
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,291
Oh.

66
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,293
- Ugh!
- Mmm. Not bad.

67
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:29,839
Who's grosser?

68
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,212
What is that?

69
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:32,550
- What is that?
- What's happening?

70
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,675
Oh, it's my vibrator,
it randomly turns on and off.

71
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:43,349
Oh, my God, you guys,
I'm gonna miss you so much next semester.

72
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:44,938
- I don't want to talk about it.
- It's sad.

73
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:46,231
- No, no, no, no.
- Dude,

74
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:48,396
Al Gore is guest-lecturing next semester.

75
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,360
Maybe you don't want to go to Australia.
I don't know.

76
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,525
- Yeah.
- On my 21st birthday, though,

77
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:54,235
my dad's getting us the chopper.

78
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,904
I said I don't want to talk about it.

79
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:57,405
So I don't know what's happening.

80
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:58,907
I don't even want to go. I just...

81
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,492
It was so hard to get into
the political science program.

82
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:04,037
And plus, my gym class
is bungee jumping, so...

83
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,413
Oh, my God, wear a good bra.

84
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:08,249
Well, look, we'll have
all of senior year together,

85
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,044
and then we'll have the rest of
our lives together, so it's fine.

86
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:12,921
- Yeah.
- You promise?

87
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:16,299
You guys, our kids are gonna play together.

88
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:18,259
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my gosh!

89
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:20,678
- We're so lucky!
- Get in here! Come here.

90
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:22,764
Oh. Mmm!

91
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:25,600
- Okay, that is a second vibrator.
- Yeah, I have a few.

92
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:26,893
Just... Just, yeah.

93
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:29,604
- No!
- Janine, no!

94
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,314
- No! No! No!
- Janine, get out!

95
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:32,899
- Come on.
- Janine!

96
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:33,983
Oh, my God! Stop!

97
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:35,655
- Bathroom is next-door!
- Cannot believe!

98
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:37,782
- Every damn weekend with this!
- Stop! She's already peeing.

99
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:39,030
Janine!

100
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:40,698
Whoo!

101
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,533
What! What!

102
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:51,709
Hi. I'm Jessica Thayer,
and I'm running for state senate.

103
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:55,254
Crime, underfunded schools, sewage.

104
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:58,424
These are real problems
that our community is facing.

105
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:02,053
Looking forward to your vote on November 3.

106
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:03,972
Thank you.

107
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:08,434
- It's great.
- Well, 60% of the focus group

108
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:10,561
did say that it seemed
like you wouldn't put out.

109
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:13,231
What? Why are they being asked that?

110
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,817
Don't know, but 60% is, like, a lot.

111
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,902
- Yeah.
- We're still so close.

112
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:21,114
I don't understand,
Wesson literally tweeted out a dick pic.

113
00:05:21,197 --> 00:05:22,160
He apologized.

114
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,034
Yes. He said, "I'm sorry, wrong dick pic,"

115
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:27,328
and then he tweeted out another one.

116
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,957
Look, if Wesson wins, he's literally
gonna cut every single program

117
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,542
that actually helps people.

118
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,127
We know that. Right?

119
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:36,713
But people want to vote
for someone they can relate to.

120
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:38,339
They feel safe with Wesson.

121
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:39,677
They want to have a beer with him.

122
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:44,012
I'm not sure anyone
wants to have a beer with that.

123
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:49,142
Oh.

124
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:51,189
Hey, Alice.

125
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:54,522
Hey. I am so excited for this trip.

126
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,899
I got my IUD taken out for Miami.

127
00:05:56,983 --> 00:05:58,735
Um, is that a good idea?

128
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:00,737
Uh, yeah. It's your bachelorette weekend.

129
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,697
Jess, Wesson tweeted out another dick pic,

130
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,615
and it's already got 10,000 retweets.

131
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,409
Alice, I... I got to call you back.

132
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:11,873
Tulum, give her back her Kindle!

133
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,459
Every fuckin' day.

134
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:23,051
- Hey.
- Mmm. Hey.

135
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:26,345
I'm so sorry. I got stuck at the office.

136
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:27,972
It's okay.

137
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:29,849
Mmm.

138
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:32,894
- I got you chicken cashew nut, extra nut.
- Oh, no.

139
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:34,896
I ate an apple

140
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,232
and a bag of very, very
stale pretzels at the office.

141
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:40,234
It was so hard to get extra nut.

142
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:43,071
That woman is so mean.
She yells at me all the time.

143
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:44,909
She thought I hung up,
but I heard her call me a dipshit.

144
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:48,076
- How much did you tip?
- 20%.

145
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:51,162
- I know. I know, I know.
- Yeah. Like, I couldn't. I...

146
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,365
You're just such a good person.

147
00:06:54,082 --> 00:06:55,917
Oh, it's Alice. I forgot to call her back.

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,669
- It's okay, get it.
- No. I can't, I can't, I can't.

149
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:00,963
- Enough with my bachelorette itinerary.
- Ah.

150
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:02,593
- Like, she's planned it to the half hour.
- Wow.

151
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:06,761
Yeah, I feel like this weekend
has come at the worst possible time.

152
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,096
I'm so stressed out.

153
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:09,889
You'll see your friends, you'll have fun.

154
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:10,973
It'll be restorative.

155
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:13,184
Like that time we took Xanax
and slept for 16 hours.

156
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,061
Oh, God, that was good.

157
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:16,854
You know, I love those girls,

158
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:19,152
but I really just don't want to
have a party weekend right now.

159
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:22,235
- Mmm-hmm.
- I want to have a weekend with you.

160
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,195
- I miss you.
- Mmm-hmm. I miss you, too.

161
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,117
- You've been at the office, like, nonstop.
- I know.

162
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:27,198
Mmm.

163
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:31,369
Mmm. Mmm.

164
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:34,038
Wait, wait, one... If we keep kissing,

165
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:35,498
I'm gonna want to have sex.

166
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,833
I'm okay with that.

167
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,292
- I'm down.
- Okay.

168
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:41,921
But I have, like, four things
I have to do before.

169
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:44,844
I just have to print out those itineraries
for the city council meeting.

170
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:46,801
And I have to email the Herald.

171
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:50,304
I have, like, a 25-minute-ish interview.

172
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:51,597
- Ooh. Okay.
- I...

173
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:54,142
I tell you what, I'm gonna
let you do all that,

174
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:56,506
and I'm gonna go masturbate
in the shower and go to sleep.

175
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,147
- Really?
- Yeah.

176
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:01,566
- You're the best.
- Well...

177
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:04,068
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

178
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:09,031
- So, I texted you the address.
- Jess! Shots! Shots!

179
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:11,367
Shots, shots, shots, shots! Shots! Shots!

180
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,870
Shots, shots, shots!

181
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:16,956
Yay! Yes!

182
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,374
Oh, my God.

183
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,668
- What's on my head?
- This is it.

184
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,420
Your bachelorette weekend.

185
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:25,548
I have been waiting for this moment
since the first day of freshman year.

186
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:28,092
- Get in here.
- You have?

187
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:31,637
Oh, my God, there's gonna be
so many hot Miami babes.

188
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:33,598
We are gonna be swimmin' in dick, girl!

189
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:35,641
Hi, Alice.

190
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,351
- Peter. Hi.
- Hey.

191
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:39,061
And get out of here, she's mine now.

192
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,523
Don't get in too much trouble, okay?

193
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:44,984
- Yeah, I won't.
- Let's go, let's do it.

194
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:46,739
Drive safe.
Have fun at your bachelor party, okay?

195
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:47,904
Will do.

196
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:49,534
Hey, Alice, be careful swimming
in all that dick.

197
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:51,073
What are you? Okay, bye.

198
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,117
I'm so happy to see you.

199
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:55,912
Oh, this weekend's gonna be so much fun.

200
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:57,955
Can't wait to see my girls!

201
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,542
When the pepper spray
hits your face, and it will,

202
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:03,711
keep your mouth closed tight.

203
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,880
- We are peaceful protestors.
- Yes!

204
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,382
Yet we fight, you know? Yet we are strong!

205
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:09,967
- Yeah! Yeah!
- This is war!

206
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:12,845
Okay, I got to head to a bachelorette.

207
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:15,973
But if anybody from the group disappears
from the protest,

208
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:18,309
you text my cell phone immediately.

209
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:20,728
You have a cell phone?

210
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:22,730
- Uh, no.
- You're one of them!

211
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:27,017
I'll pick you up after school
on Monday, okay, sweetie?

212
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,403
Mommy, do you have to go to Miami?

213
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,114
Yes, I really do.

214
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:34,450
But I'm gonna miss you so much.

215
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,078
Technically, my time
started 20 minutes ago,

216
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:39,997
so, going to note this
for the custody hearing.

217
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,835
Mmm. I love you. Mwah! Mwah!

218
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:46,545
Bye.

219
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,682
Come on, shake your body,
baby, do the conga

220
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,767
I know you can't control
yourself any longer...

221
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,063
Well, well, well.

222
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,232
Damn.

223
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:07,817
Damn.

224
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,151
How do you do it?

225
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:11,779
How do you look
this flawless getting off a plane?

226
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:13,281
It's honestly rude.

227
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:14,740
What, are you flirting with me?

228
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:17,868
I would not flirt with a happily
married woman who broke my heart.

229
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:20,788
Oh, my God, you broke up with me,
don't even start with that.

230
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:24,125
Excuse me,
now you are flirting with me, okay?

231
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,960
It's good to see you.

232
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:28,129
It's good to see you, too.

233
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,464
Girl, I have had a day.

234
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:34,093
First was full, I had to ride business.
It was disgusting.

235
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:38,264
- Gross.
- You're serious. Okay. Cool.

236
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:42,059
Oh, my God, did you hear
Alice is making us go to a foam party?

237
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:43,185
Ugh! I know.

238
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:45,313
She has a scary amount of time
on her hands.

239
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,944
Even though she's a full-time teacher,
I'm still like, "Get a job."

240
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:49,525
Do you have a job?

241
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:53,070
Activism is a full-time job, but...

242
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,156
- Also no.
- Mmm-hmm.

243
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,158
Look at them, the magic is still there.

244
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,367
- Hello!
- Hello!

245
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,037
- Hi!
- Hi! Yes! Yes!

246
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:06,167
- Oh, my God!
- It is all happening!

247
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,294
Mmm! God, you smell so good.

248
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,504
- I have, like, half a pound of weed in my bra.
- Ah.

249
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:14,508
- Hey, Alice, how's your mom?
- Well, Alzheimer's is tough, but she's good.

250
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:15,760
Good.

251
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,512
The Wallace 5th Floor Girls
are back together again!

252
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:22,395
God, when was the last time
we were all together?

253
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:23,976
I think it was two summers ago

254
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,815
when we came to visit you
in your tree, right?

255
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:27,980
No, no, no, 'cause Jess
couldn't make it, it was, uh,

256
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:29,857
New Year's Eve, when Blair was in labor.

257
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:32,902
- Oh, my God. Crazy.
- God, that was three years ago, then.

258
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:34,820
Yeah. Well, we only have 55 hours,

259
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:37,656
so let's stop wasting
our motherfucking time

260
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:39,784
and let's get the party started.

261
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:42,411
- Yes!
- Alice, you rock!

262
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:44,080
The party starts now.

263
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,126
Oh, my God. That was a bad idea.

264
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,128
- Yeah, we're in an airport.
- That was bad.

265
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:52,880
- That sounded like a gunshot.
- Yeah.

266
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,006
- Let's go.
- Yep.

267
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,091
Sorry. Our bad.

268
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:56,804
Sorry, everyone,
bachelorette weekend.

269
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:59,929
I was never here! Never! Move!

270
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,647
Come on, shake your body,
baby, do the conga

271
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,235
I know you can't control
yourself any longer

272
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:12,733
- Ooh.
- Wow.

273
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:15,861
- Nice Miami house, mami.
- Very nice.

274
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,905
- Oh, gracias.
- Um...

275
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:20,991
We are supposed to pick up
the keys from the neighbors.

276
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,247
Did you bring a bathing suit?

277
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:24,540
- Hello?
- The beach is nice.

278
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,621
Hi.

279
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,456
Sorry, somebody left some keys for...

280
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,253
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, sorry, we'll come back.

281
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,168
- So sorry.
- Oh, hi, girls.

282
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:32,837
No, no, I'm sorry.

283
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,214
Let me put something on.

284
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:36,507
Oh.

285
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,092
- Come on in.
- Very funny.

286
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:39,385
- Is it really?
- I love it.

287
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:40,970
- Hello.
- Hi.

288
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:42,930
- Thank you. Oh.
- Hi. Oh.

289
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,056
Okay.

290
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,266
What brings you to Miami?

291
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,685
Business? Pleasure?

292
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:49,478
The business of pleasure?

293
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:51,397
Oh, bachelorette weekend.

294
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,691
- Jess is getting married.
- Ah.

295
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:55,526
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

296
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,861
This marriage, will it be open?

297
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,116
You know, we haven't discussed it.

298
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:01,115
But, probably closed. Yeah.

299
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,992
Tightly, tightly closed.

300
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,786
Lea, does she not remind you

301
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,038
of our French girl from Turks and Caicos?

302
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:10,541
- Oh.
- She does.

303
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,418
Thank you. Thanks.

304
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:16,046
Well, we're gonna try to keep it down.

305
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,007
- Mmm-hmm.
- Oh, well, we'll try not to.

306
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,550
Oh.

307
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:20,759
Ah! Yes!

308
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,563
- They're serious.
- Go. Go, go, downstairs.

309
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,430
She is delicious.

310
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:26,891
- I want that.
- Mmm.

311
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,563
Ooh, yes.

312
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:35,483
Oh, Real World, baby! Miami!

313
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:38,319
Ew. This house represents
everything I hate.

314
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:39,987
I'm gonna go take a protest dump.

315
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,031
I call the room next to Jess! Ah.

316
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:43,866
Oh, I think that room has bunk beds,

317
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,413
so you're gonna have to share with Pippa.

318
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:46,535
Uh, who that?

319
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,413
Pippa, my Australian friend
from semester abroad.

320
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:51,210
She's been CC'd on, like,
every single email.

321
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,917
Oh, right.

322
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,880
Well, if my snoring bothers her,
she can take the couch.

323
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,882
Or she can just start on the couch
and we'll go from there.

324
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,842
We'll figure it out.
She'll start on the couch.

325
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,091
- Blair.
- What?

326
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:04,345
Can you be careful with the red wine
on the white carpet, please?

327
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,555
My biggest and only donor

328
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,474
generously lent us this house
for the weekend.

329
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,268
- So, please be careful.
- Okay.

330
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:13,854
I'm telling you, she's got bigger problems
than a wine stain

331
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:16,440
if she wants to sell this place
for 3.4 in this market.

332
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:18,734
- How do you know that?
- Zillow.

333
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,903
- I Zillow everybody.
- Really?

334
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:23,113
Like, do you know
how much my house is worth?

335
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,824
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay, atención.

336
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:27,660
Bachelorette kit time.

337
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:28,953
Let me get your attention.

338
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,371
We got it all.

339
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:33,082
Bride-to-be bathrobe for our lovely Jess,

340
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:37,545
penis straws, penis sunglasses,
penis sprinkles, penis gum,

341
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,547
penis hats, penis pasta.

342
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,950
And yes, I did get a little
drunk and ate some of that dry.

343
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,385
- Don't judge.
- No judgment.

344
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,198
Also, I wrote you a card.
But don't read it now, read it later.

345
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:48,931
- Thanks, Alice.
- Yeah.

346
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:52,977
Oh, shit. Frankie?

347
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:55,896
- Frankie?
- Frankie.

348
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,398
Oh, my God!

349
00:14:58,357 --> 00:14:59,483
- What?
- Oh!

350
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,402
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, yes, mami.

351
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,153
Is that a sex swing?

352
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,406
Ooh, your donor is a freak, Jess.

353
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:07,199
Please. She rents this house out.

354
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:09,079
I'm sure somebody else
left it here accidentally.

355
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,745
And installed a load-bearing beam
to support it accidentally.

356
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,080
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, Jess.

357
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,752
I want to audition some
dresses for tonight.

358
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:16,333
I brought 14. Come on!

359
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,421
Yeah, I wanna burn

360
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,461
Break, crash, explode

361
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:22,214
Every time you look at me,
you look at me...

362
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:23,260
Jess, if you are working,

363
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,221
- I'm gonna smack you in the face right now.
- I'm not. I'm not.

364
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:26,430
- One second.
- I'm gonna smack your face.

365
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,724
- Wait, wait, let me send it. Send, send, send.
- Put it down.

366
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,598
All right, come on, let's take a picture.

367
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:33,392
- Say, um, "Miami forever."
- Uh, forever.

368
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,107
- You want us in the picture or not?
- Do you guys want us in the photo...

369
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,023
- We're here, too.
- Oh, my gosh,

370
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:40,110
- we both look killer in that.
- Cool.

371
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,987
I'm so bummed I can't tag you
in this, on Facebook.

372
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,402
Why did you delete your account?

373
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,279
I had to. You were, you were tagging me

374
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,698
on things that could
literally ruin my career.

375
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:48,991
Yeah.

376
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,492
It's Pip! She's here!

377
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:52,620
- What? Who's that?
- Hi!

378
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:53,829
- Pip!
- Oh.

379
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,041
Sorry. Whoops.

380
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,364
- I'm sorry. Whoops.
- Hey.

381
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,503
Hello, hello, hello.

382
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,963
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

383
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:08,302
You're a goddess.
You're literally a goddess.

384
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:09,595
- Guys...
- Hi.

385
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,555
This is Pippa.

386
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,973
- Hello.
- The famous...

387
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:14,892
Frankie, Blair, Alice.

388
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:16,226
Hey, what's up?

389
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,566
My God, you guys are meeting
for the first time, this is so exciting.

390
00:16:18,646 --> 00:16:20,189
- I know.
- Nice to meet you.

391
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:23,984
This is so weird, you guys,
because it's sort of like

392
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:26,695
you're all Jess's best friends,
I'm Jess's best friend.

393
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:30,616
And so it's sort of like
we're all already best friends, you know?

394
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:33,035
Well, it's a little different for us,
sorry to interrupt,

395
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:35,996
but, uh, Jess and I were
freshman year roommates,

396
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,415
so it's kind of like family. Eh.

397
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,835
- I know, I know.
- Um, okay, I'm going to grab a chair.

398
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,212
Feel free to gel.

399
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,089
Just gonna sit on my suitcase here.

400
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:47,216
Ooh. I'm famished.

401
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:49,221
- Do you want my leftovers?
- Oh, shoot. We just finished.

402
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:50,889
No, I was gonna wrap that up
and take it to go.

403
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,429
I think we're done. Check, please!

404
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:56,725
It's okay. I'm just gonna take
some of this bread from the bread basket.

405
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:59,395
When you got bread and Vegemite,
you got yourself a meal.

406
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:00,979
What? Vegemite?

407
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,315
They should call you cuckoos
instead of Kiwis.

408
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,525
Am I right?

409
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:05,734
- Alice.
- Oh, my God.

410
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:07,236
That's funny on several levels,

411
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,447
because I'm actually Australian
and a Kiwi is a New Zealander.

412
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,492
There's nothing wrong with being a Kiwi,
we all love Kiwis,

413
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,704
but, um, it's sort of like calling
a Chinese person Japanese.

414
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:18,539
It's just sort of like, little bit racist

415
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,417
to not recognize the cultural
differences there, you know?

416
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,626
Oh, my gosh.

417
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,795
Eat me out. It's a fruit, Kiwi.

418
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,630
I'll take it.

419
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,257
Pippa, what do you do?

420
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,343
Well, singer-songwriter is the dream.

421
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:33,262
Uh, party clown is the reality.

422
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,640
- Hmm.
- Check. Just, anyone, a check.

423
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:38,350
A chair.

424
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:40,060
Oh, a chair.

425
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:42,396
Right.

426
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,149
I'm so excited to see you.
It's been so long.

427
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,900
- Tell me everything.
- I'm dying.

428
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:49,319
The flight was literally amazoir.

429
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,076
Ding, ding, ding, ding, da-dang, ding, ding.

430
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:54,032
Uh, it's toast, toast time.

431
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:55,409
Oh.

432
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,828
Raise your glasses, Jess.

433
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,164
Gosh, I can't believe
you're getting married.

434
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,916
Feels like just yesterday
you were showing me

435
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,794
how to hide that cat scratch on my face
with that cover-up.

436
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:07,129
I remember that.

437
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:08,926
And even though we don't
get to see you all the time

438
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:12,050
because you're so busy
with Peter and the campaign

439
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:15,220
and changing your Brita filters
or whatever it is you white people do,

440
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:19,016
I love you,
and you're my best friend.

441
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:24,188
Uh... To me and Jess.

442
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:26,064
- Be-cheers.
- Cheers. Again.

443
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:27,357
I love you, Alice. Thank you.

444
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,655
Three toasts is the limit tonight, though.
You're cut off.

445
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:30,948
If you're gonna do another one, do it now,

446
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,116
'cause I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

447
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:34,281
- Do you want to come?
- Why would I come with you?

448
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,366
It's a heteronormative thing that girls do.

449
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,956
Okay, guys,
no one responded to my emails

450
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:40,746
about which club we were gonna go to,

451
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,957
so I printed out the top
10 according to Yelp.

452
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,294
I have my personal favorite,
but I don't want to sway anyone, so...

453
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,337
- Is it the one that's circled in big red?
- Yeah.

454
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:53,926
I was kind of hoping that
we could make it an early night.

455
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:56,929
Yeah, right. What?

456
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,348
- That doesn't feel right.
- No, I'm just so exhausted.

457
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:00,644
I mean, I've been so overworked...

458
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:02,684
No, not gonna happen, baby girl, all right?

459
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:06,647
'Cause this is the biggest weekend
of our lives, all right?

460
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:09,191
Ooh, girls. Ooh, girls.

461
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,943
Hi. I just got some coke from the busboy.

462
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:12,277
- You fucking what?
- What?

463
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:13,821
America. Already?

464
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,656
Sort of right on the nose.

465
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,494
- Yes, okay, now we're talking.
- Ba-bam! Booyah!

466
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:18,742
Now, okay, I'm in. I'm in.

467
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:21,745
Okay, guys, I can't do any cocaine.

468
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:23,121
I'm running for office.

469
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,793
What? No one's gonna find out
you did a little coke...

470
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,167
- Stop.
- Did a little coke at your bachelorette.

471
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:30,337
I haven't really done drugs
myself since I sort of...

472
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,549
I smoked this bit of shoji root

473
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:36,969
on an excursion in the desert, and I died.

474
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,055
Anyway, I'm very jet-lagged,

475
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,598
so I will do cocaine, yes.

476
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:43,604
- So everyone's in? Yep?
- Dope, dope, dope.

477
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,602
You guys, hold on. I don't know.

478
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:48,981
Stop being a stupid fucking cunt
and do a little fucking cocaine!

479
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,664
Jesus, Frankie.

480
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,734
Sorry, I did a little bit of it.

481
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:55,654
Jess.

482
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:59,074
It would mean...

483
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,076
Yeah.

484
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:04,079
It would mean so much to me,

485
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:08,876
if we could do a little
bit of cocaine together.

486
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:14,715
So disgusting!

487
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,133
- Let me get a little more.
- Yep.

488
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:20,429
Before, I was very tired,
and now I'm sort of very awake.

489
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:22,514
That's the cocaine.

490
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:23,807
- I figured.
- Yeah.

491
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:26,143
I love this. I love Miami!

492
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,519
- Yeah, girl!
- Miami!

493
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:31,815
Whoo!

494
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,318
Okay, now put on these fucking sashes.

495
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:43,744
Trouble

496
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,413
I don't look for trouble,
but trouble looks for me

497
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:50,250
And it's been waiting
around corners since I was 17

498
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:54,713
They say, "Here comes a hurricane
Trouble is her middle name"

499
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,716
But I don't look for trouble,
yeah, trouble looks for me

500
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:58,804
Hey, hey

501
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:01,053
I just want to live a quiet life

502
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,846
I'll make an excellent wife

503
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,682
Man, I swear I really try

504
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,435
But some boys, they just can't eat it whole

505
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,270
Trouble is my name, you know

506
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:12,356
Trouble is my name, you know

507
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,027
- Thank you!
- All right.

508
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:22,366
Mmm.

509
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,160
Oh, my God!

510
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,995
Yes, yes, yes!

511
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,331
- Oh, my God!
- No, no, no.

512
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:30,832
Man, it smells like barf over here.

513
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,626
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- God!

514
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,047
Blurry

515
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,593
Blurry, blurry

516
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:46,390
Blurry

517
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,227
Blurry, blurry

518
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,354
Knock 'em back, one, two

519
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:53,897
But it's gettin' kinda blurry

520
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:55,315
Get blurry with it

521
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:56,733
Got my eyes on you

522
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:59,903
But you're gettin' kinda blurry,
no hurry with it

523
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:02,114
Rock your body, and it all makes sense

524
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,324
Got me up under your influence

525
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,076
I'm getting us drinks.

526
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,453
Knockout blurry, no worries

527
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:11,957
You guys, you guys,
let's get Jess a stripper!

528
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,001
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

529
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,168
Right?

530
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:19,548
You guys, you guys, you guys,
male or female, though?

531
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:21,717
Male. I'm thinking male for her.

532
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,094
- Yeah.
- Okay, I got it.

533
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,472
Frankie, do you have a tampon?

534
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:28,932
- I need one.
- Uh-huh, yup.

535
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:30,684
- Thank you.
- Got one. Here we go.

536
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:33,729
What day of your flow are you on?

537
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:36,106
Oh, no, no. It's our code.

538
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:38,275
In college, we would
ask each other for tampons

539
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,319
if some guy was skeezing us out
and we wanted to be saved.

540
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:43,196
You just say "tampon," and they run.

541
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,781
Oh, my God, I love that.

542
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:48,201
I used to use tampons,
but now I use David cups.

543
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:50,787
- You mean DivaCups.
- No, no, David.

544
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,998
They were designed by my neighbor, David,

545
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,709
to collect blood for an art
installation he's doing.

546
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,961
Let's stop talking about periods now.

547
00:22:58,128 --> 00:22:59,296
Cool.

548
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:03,175
All right, everybody, we have a special
request from a Caucasian named

549
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:04,843
Alice!

550
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:07,345
That's me. I'm Caucasian Alice.

551
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:09,222
Bring all your girls up here. Grab 'em.

552
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:10,807
Jess, come on. Come on.

553
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:14,144
Give her the drinks. Go on.
Girls, get up there.

554
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:17,814
We won the talent show freshman year
with this little routine.

555
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:20,484
Might want to stand back.
No, physically, get back!

556
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,194
Okay.

557
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:24,408
If you didn't go to college with us,
you're not in the routine.

558
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:25,572
Okay, get into places.

559
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:30,160
All you ladies pop your pussy like this

560
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,245
Shake your body, don't stop, don't miss

561
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:34,748
All you ladies pop your pussy like this

562
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:36,750
Shake your body, don't stop, don't miss

563
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:41,713
Just do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now

564
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:43,632
Lick it good, suck this pussy

565
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,258
- Just like you should
- Yeah!

566
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:49,012
My neck, my back,
lick my pussy and my crack

567
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:54,142
My neck, my back, lick
my pussy and my crack

568
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:57,854
My neck, my back,
lick my pussy and my crack

569
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,648
You're doing so good!

570
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,650
Lick it now, lick it good

571
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:04,486
- Lick this pussyjust like you should
- Come on

572
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:06,655
Right now, lick it good

573
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:07,948
These are my new friends.

574
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,867
My neck, my back, lick

575
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,119
Jess, Jess, Jess!

576
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:14,371
Oh!

577
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,373
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

578
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,625
Are you okay? You all right?

579
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:20,961
Did anybody see me fall?

580
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:22,716
- Everybody saw. Everybody saw.
- No. Well, yeah.

581
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:25,298
- Alice! You fell!
- Yeah.

582
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,634
It was be-gorgeous!

583
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:30,011
Jess, you were supposed to catch me.

584
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:32,139
You know, I forgot that one part.
I'm so sorry.

585
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:33,515
It's a pretty important part!

586
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:36,977
Would some more cocaine
make you feel better?

587
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,186
Yes!

588
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:40,981
I'm gonna party till the break of day

589
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:47,112
This Montepulciano is majestic
and rebellious.

590
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,364
Tell me, what are you tasting?

591
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:51,283
Pepper.

592
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:52,534
Pass. I need more time.

593
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:55,287
Forest floor.

594
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,371
Licorice.

595
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,624
- There's a nostalgia to it, you know?
- Mmm-hmm. Yes.

596
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,085
- You are all correct!
- Oh!

597
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:04,671
- Yes!
- I need more time.

598
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:08,008
Oh.

599
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:09,509
It's Jess.

600
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:12,053
- Take it.
- Okay. Hello.

601
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:15,640
I'm drunk! I lost two credit cards already.

602
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:17,142
Oh, no. Okay.

603
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:19,895
- Well, it's getting pretty wild over here, too.
- Really?

604
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:22,022
I'm getting, like, a light beeswax.

605
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:23,607
- Oh, I like that.
- Oh.

606
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:26,860
Jess, guy says that we can drive his Lambo.

607
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:29,154
- I, um, I... Babe, I got to go.
- All right.

608
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:30,283
Call me when you're home safe.

609
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:32,449
- I will. I love you.
- Love you, too.

610
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:33,700
Get off the phone.

611
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,203
Are we ready to get crazy?

612
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:38,288
- Yeah.
- Sure.

613
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:41,875
This Lambrusco is served...

614
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,002
Chilled!

615
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:50,887
Do you guys remember Michelle?

616
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:53,762
Oh, Michelle,
she was obsessed with Nickelback.

617
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:58,433
Ooh, beauty, Jess!

618
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:01,228
- I know what this soiree needs.
- What?

619
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,479
Pizza!

620
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:03,924
Yeah!

621
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:06,399
- Pizza! Pizza!
- Yes, yes, yes.

622
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:08,276
- Yes!
- Nice! Sweet!

623
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:09,611
Okay, I love her.

624
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:11,071
- Right?
- Yes.

625
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:13,657
She is... Be-mazing?
I don't know how she would say it,

626
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,866
but she is incredible!

627
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,535
I am telling you, she is one of us.

628
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,704
- She is so free-spirited.
- Totally.

629
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:21,793
- I just... I love her.
- I don't know about that.

630
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:23,545
- I totally feel it.
- Do you guys feel like

631
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,336
she's here on a work visa,

632
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:29,214
or, like, a tourist visa or,
like, illegally?

633
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,258
- Like, what's her deal?
- What, dude?

634
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,263
- She's here for a bachelorette party.
- That is crazy.

635
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:34,598
- Build a wall.
- I just, like, don't...

636
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,308
I don't want to do
anything illegal tonight.

637
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:37,514
- What?
- You don't?

638
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:39,224
You just snorted a mound of cocaine.

639
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:42,394
- Simultaneously.
- That was, like, in the name of Jess.

640
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:44,020
That was, like, for Jess.

641
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:45,775
- Don't put that on me.
- Oh, check you out.

642
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:46,982
You're literally cuckoo.

643
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,570
I'm just, like, voicing
what some people are thinking,

644
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,944
- you know what I mean?
- Do you have snags?

645
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:54,906
Okay, no snags.

646
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,118
Um, is... This is a pizza shop, yeah?

647
00:26:58,201 --> 00:26:59,744
God, it is so warm.

648
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:01,496
- You guys have to get in.
- Mmm,

649
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:03,039
I am coming.

650
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:04,749
I am gonna warn you now.

651
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:09,462
Uh, did not have time to self-wax,
so it is like a jungle down there.

652
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:10,880
- Self-wax?
- Yeah.

653
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,466
Like, with those weird little,
like, paper strips?

654
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,926
Yikes, dude.

655
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,470
Even I'm like, "Yikes, dude."

656
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:20,974
Look, you guys, I don't understand.
Why all the hate?

657
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,225
Ooh.

658
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:23,893
- Mmm.
- Okay, I got it, I got it.

659
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,398
- Well, that was fast.
- But, seriously,

660
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,359
we're gonna talk about
this self-wax thing later.

661
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:28,565
- Okay, come on.
- Ooh.

662
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:35,780
- Hey...
- Oh, not bad.

663
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:38,825
Stripper's here!

664
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,160
- You guys!
- Yes!

665
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:41,244
I don't want a stripper!

666
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:42,829
Did you bring a CD or anything?

667
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,956
Like, Now That's What I Call Music!
Or anything?

668
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,958
- No. No, I didn't.
- No? It's all right.

669
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,588
I got some pretty filthy music on my phone.

670
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:50,545
- I'll hook you up.
- Thanks.

671
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:53,214
- Hey.
- Hi.

672
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:56,092
Hey, um, I, uh, I got to take a piss.

673
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:58,303
Oh, yeah, there's a bathroom down there.

674
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:00,096
All right.

675
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:02,182
It's, like, down there.

676
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:03,933
Mmm.

677
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:05,727
I bet he's going to fluff his junk!

678
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,979
Let's give him room,
let's make a stage, yes.

679
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,689
You guys, I don't want a stripper.

680
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:11,399
I think he looks like he's on something.

681
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,943
He's definitely on something.
Like bath salts.

682
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:16,196
Oh, my God, he's gonna eat our faces.

683
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:19,282
- Oh, God, he would!
- Ugh, this vintage remote is so confusing.

684
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:22,369
I've never even had a striptease.
I mean...

685
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:23,540
- Nope.
- Well, there was that one time.

686
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,038
- I love myself
- ALICE: Yes!

687
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,581
Maybe somebody else should go.

688
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:28,875
- Stripper. Stripper, stripper.
- So, this is Jess,

689
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:31,461
the bride-to-be, your subject, okay?

690
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:34,089
And lucky for you, so lucky,

691
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:35,965
you get to do whatever you want.

692
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,050
Fuck her!

693
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:38,259
- Alice!
- Jesus.

694
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:39,719
- Too much.
- What? If it happens.

695
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:43,139
- Okay, whoo! Here we go.
- Do it.

696
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:48,728
First layer, off.

697
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:50,188
I touch myself

698
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:51,439
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah!

699
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:54,567
- Okay.
- Come on, Jess!

700
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:56,152
Here he comes. He's looking at me.

701
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:00,865
Ooh, happy Boxing Day.

702
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:02,534
Yes!

703
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:04,911
It's kind of turning me on,
but I really have to pee,

704
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:06,830
so it's, like, so confusing.

705
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:09,833
Mansploitation, bitch! Yes!

706
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,671
Let's get to the beans,
let's get to the beans.

707
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:12,877
Yeah, just do it.

708
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,754
Get it over with. Get it over with!

709
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:17,882
- So good!
- Love her.

710
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:19,759
Make her feel special.

711
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:22,387
- Yes!
- Get that!

712
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,180
Oh, he's warm.

713
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:26,224
Ooh, all right. I like it.

714
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:27,559
Okay.

715
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:29,541
I know you want it, you little slut.

716
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:31,354
Oh, God! No! Ew.

717
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:33,231
Gross. You sit down.

718
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:34,858
So aggressive.

719
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,485
- I'm definitely gay.
- Okay, my turn!

720
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:38,862
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

721
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:41,948
- Oh!
- Oh, shit!

722
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:43,032
Holy shit.

723
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:45,743
- I'm good!
- Hey.

724
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,454
Are you okay?

725
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:50,457
Oh, him? He's fine.
You're okay, right, bud?

726
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:51,916
Oh, God.

727
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,502
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit! That's blood!

728
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:56,463
What the fuck? Oh, God.

729
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:58,590
Oh, my God, he's not breathing!

730
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:00,216
- Shit!
- Does anybody know CPR?

731
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,510
- Oh, my God.
- I'll look it up on YouTube!

732
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:04,137
- No, no, no.
- Oh, my God.

733
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:05,638
We got to do something!

734
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:08,349
Bugger! It's playing an advert
for toilet tissue.

735
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:09,517
Jess, do something!

736
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:10,643
- Shit.
- No, no, no.

737
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,020
Holy shit!

738
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,647
Oh, please, God,
please don't let this happen.

739
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:16,733
He's bleeding out. I can't stop the blood!

740
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:19,444
I have some Advil.
I'll get it out of my bag.

741
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:21,154
What's Advil gonna do, Alice?

742
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:24,240
- It's extra-strength, bitch!
- Somebody call an ambulance!

743
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,766
- Four, five, six, seven, eight...
- He doesn't have a pulse.

744
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:31,748
Fuck.

745
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:33,917
He's dead.

746
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:37,921
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

747
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:40,089
I...

748
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:43,718
I don't want anybody else

749
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:44,928
When I think about you

750
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:47,555
Turn off the fucking music!

751
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:51,643
Oh, I don't want anybo...

752
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:58,066
- Oh, shit.
- I'm so sorry.

753
00:30:58,733 --> 00:30:59,734
I didn't mean to.

754
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:02,111
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

755
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:03,530
I'm so sorry.

756
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:05,323
- No, no, no.
- Oh, God, the blood,

757
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:07,075
it's going everywhere.

758
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:08,785
Paper towels! Somebody get paper towels!

759
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:10,206
Why don't you do something, Blair!

760
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:11,621
I'm delegating!

761
00:31:13,164 --> 00:31:14,707
- I killed a guy.
- It's okay.

762
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:16,417
Oh, God.

763
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:18,545
- Oh, not the bathroom towels.
- Oh, shit.

764
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:19,754
What are you talking about!

765
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:21,134
Who cares about towels right now?

766
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:23,049
Well, I don't know!
I don't know what to do!

767
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:25,093
I killed a guy!

768
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:26,803
Oh, God!

769
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:28,721
- I killed a guy today.
- Okay, okay.

770
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:30,643
- Deep breaths, deep breaths.
- "What'd you do?"

771
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,517
- Deep breath.
- "I killed a guy."

772
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:34,185
"What have you been up to?"

773
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:35,728
"Death."

774
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:39,397
- Keep it in there.
- That's better. That's better.

775
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:41,484
Time to call the police. Yeah?

776
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:43,448
No, no, no, don't call the police.
We're all high.

777
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:46,114
Let's get rid of the drugs,
and then we'll call the police.

778
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:48,286
Yeah, we'll just,
we'll clean up a dead stripper, cool.

779
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:50,201
Well, technically, he's a prostitute.

780
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:53,955
- He's a prostitute?
- No.

781
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:55,248
I got him from Craigslist.

782
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:57,208
He is a stripper, but then also an escort.

783
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,836
You hired a gigolo?

784
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:02,046
Don't judge sex work, Blair!

785
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:03,923
- Oh, my God!
- Frankie!

786
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:06,759
You know I'm running for public office!
How could you do this to me?

787
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:08,595
It's worse for me. I have two strikes.

788
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:11,222
If I get a third,
I could go to jail for 25 to life.

789
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,228
I'm not even supposed to be
out of the state right now.

790
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:15,748
I had to pry my ankle monitor off
with a shoehorn to get here!

791
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:17,520
Oh, God.

792
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:19,397
It's the chair's fault.

793
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:22,108
Fuckin' shit chair!

794
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:25,194
Wait a minute. You guys, wait a minute!

795
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:27,113
It was an accident. Right?

796
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:29,490
So, like, we're not gonna
get in trouble for an accident.

797
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,075
We're in Florida, Alice.

798
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:33,661
A white dude is dead at
the hands of a bunch of women.

799
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:34,996
Yeah, white women.

800
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:37,540
I'm black, in case any
of you have forgotten.

801
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:39,671
I think the only person
who's forgotten that is you.

802
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,419
How dare you.

803
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,212
I rest my case.

804
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:46,883
I knew this weekend was a terrible idea.

805
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:48,343
What? No.

806
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:51,554
This can still be the best
weekend of our fucking lives!

807
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:55,683
Let's just smile a little bit about it. Right?
Smile more.

808
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,101
Okay, we're gonna be fine.

809
00:32:57,185 --> 00:32:58,898
- We're gonna call the cops, but Jess is right.
- Definitely.

810
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,775
We need to make this seem
as innocent as possible,

811
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:02,215
so let's get rid of all the drugs.

812
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:03,775
I'm on it.

813
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:06,778
Alice, not by doing them!

814
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:10,198
Okay, someone tell me what to do,
and I will do it.

815
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:12,742
Uh?

816
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:14,429
What the...

817
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:17,705
- Oh. Oh.
- Shit, shit, shit.

818
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:23,294
It's pizza.

819
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:25,963
You guys, what are we gonna do?

820
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:28,508
The house is made of glass. He can see in.

821
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:30,593
We got to move him, you guys.

822
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:31,904
Do it, do it, do it.

823
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:36,474
Go, go, go.

824
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:40,019
Wait, wait, wait, you guys.

825
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:43,064
You guys, you guys, you guys,
wait, wait, wait. One second.

826
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:45,274
Watch the couch.

827
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:49,971
- Shit.
- Somebody answer the door.

828
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:52,031
Does anyone have cash for a tip?

829
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:53,366
I have Australian dollars.

830
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:55,034
They're stronger than American dollars.

831
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:00,039
Castelucci Pizza.

832
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,711
- What's this?
- Leave.

833
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:07,797
- Oh, God.
- Oh, fuck.

834
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:09,048
I was natural.

835
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:11,008
Okay, open it.

836
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:12,760
Open it up.

837
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:14,637
Oh, yes.

838
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:17,140
How can you eat right now?

839
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:20,893
Eating is the number one way
people deal with stress, okay?

840
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:22,645
Don't give me shit.

841
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:24,021
You guys want some?

842
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:27,492
- Oh, yeah, I'd go for a slice. One second.
- I'll have a slice. Yeah.

843
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,237
Okay, I think now it's time for us
to call the cops, yeah?

844
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,573
Wait, wait, wait.
I think we should call a lawyer first,

845
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:35,787
so we know exactly what to say
during the interrogation.

846
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:37,618
- Okay.
- Wait, I'm sorry, what's going on?

847
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,030
We're gonna be interrogated?

848
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,831
We are 100% gonna be interrogated.

849
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:44,041
Somebody died in a sketchy way.

850
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,797
They're gonna separate
us into little cells,

851
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:47,462
you know, with swinging lights.

852
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:50,131
The coppers are gonna try
to crack us, fucking pigs!

853
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:52,675
Okay, let's definitely call a lawyer, then.

854
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:55,011
Oh, my God. My Uncle Jack.

855
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:57,266
He was on the team
that defended Bernie Madoff.

856
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:59,348
- Ah, thank God.
- Thank God.

857
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:02,643
Wait. We should use a burner phone
so there's no record.

858
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:04,440
- Good idea.
- That's actually a good point.

859
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,355
- Shit!
- What, Alice?

860
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:07,982
The foam party!

861
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:09,692
Should I sell our passes?

862
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:12,028
Wow.

863
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:14,781
You're right. Let's play it by ear.

864
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:16,199
Smart, Jess.

865
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:19,702
Oh, shit! Peter!

866
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:21,541
- Okay.
- I forgot to call him when I got home.

867
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:23,080
- Do not answer that.
- I have to.

868
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:24,290
- No!
- Jess. Jess, stop.

869
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:25,416
Hello!

870
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,794
- Hey, babe.
- Hi. How's it going?

871
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:29,962
- Stop.
- Are you home safe? You never called.

872
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:31,175
- Hang up. Hang up.
- Yeah, I am.

873
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:32,340
Yeah, everything's great.

874
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:34,467
Did you do whippets again?
You sound really weird.

875
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:36,636
- What?
- Is everything all right?

876
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:38,641
- Hang up. Hang up. Hang up.
- Stop, stop, stop.

877
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:40,515
- Peter, something really bad happened.
- No.

878
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:42,433
- What?
- No, this guy came over.

879
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:44,060
He was a stripper, like, a prostitute.

880
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:45,273
- A prostitute?
- And we were drunk,

881
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:47,730
and coked up, and I don't know what to do.

882
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:48,981
About what? The wedding?

883
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:51,612
Jess, do you still want to get married?

884
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:53,452
- You can't, you can't...
- No!

885
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,987
Jess!

886
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,536
I can't believe you just did that.

887
00:35:58,616 --> 00:36:01,452
We can't talk to anybody
until we consult with a lawyer.

888
00:36:01,536 --> 00:36:02,703
She's right. You know what,

889
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:04,834
I'm collecting everyone's phones
until we know what the plan is.

890
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:06,541
- Agreed?
- Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

891
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:07,834
- Yes.
- Agreed.

892
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:08,918
- Mmm-hmm.
- Fine.

893
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:13,297
- Well, I have a game on it that relaxes me.
- Give it.

894
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:15,967
Thank you.

895
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:20,933
Okay, so we got to get this burner phone
from a convenience store.

896
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,223
- Smart.
- Yeah, good idea.

897
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:23,516
Frankie and I can go.

898
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,684
- Great.
- Um...

899
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:27,478
- Or, like, anybody else could go.
- Why?

900
00:36:27,562 --> 00:36:30,022
- Do we argue?
- We bicker. Yeah, we bicker.

901
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:32,528
- It's true, but...
- No. I think that we debate,

902
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:34,402
which is a normal part of talking.

903
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:36,946
That's funny. That's the same
thing, debating and arguing.

904
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,364
- It's semantics.
- "Semantics."

905
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:40,449
Wow, I didn't realize
I was talking to a wordsmith.

906
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:42,121
- They used to be lovers, yeah?
- Three syllables.

907
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:44,121
I'm a wordsmith 'cause
I read the news regularly.

908
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:45,374
- Is it that obvious?
- Oh, my God.

909
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:49,375
- I'm too busy shopping, right?
- I have a sort of a sense of these things.

910
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:52,753
Also, she's been fixated on her nips.

911
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:54,717
Just because I don't use
Tom's of Maine deodorant, which,

912
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:55,885
by the way, does not work...

913
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:57,216
I don't use Tom's deodorant...

914
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,635
- It's kind of nasty to watch, isn't it?
- Into my body.

915
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:02,513
Yeah, so, I call. She picks up.

916
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:04,227
- Uh-huh.
- She sounds very strange.

917
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:05,520
I know something's wrong immediately.

918
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,101
And then, finally, she admits it.

919
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:08,898
She says something really bad
happened with a prostitute.

920
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:10,980
- Ooh!
- That does not mean she cheated.

921
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:13,941
But if she was going to cheat,
this is when she would do it.

922
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,819
- Oh, God.
- Miami, bachelorette party.

923
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:18,738
- It's pretty classic.
- Mmm...

924
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:21,991
It's not cheating if it's
with a prostitute. Technically.

925
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:24,160
- What?
- What? Yes, it is.

926
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:26,621
Look, guys, we have
to have realistic attitudes

927
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:28,247
about sexual exclusivity.

928
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:31,000
Whatever. It doesn't
even matter, because...

929
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,797
I asked her if she still
wanted to get married.

930
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:34,921
She screamed "no" and then she hung up!

931
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:36,756
So, guess what, guys,

932
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,175
there's no wedding for you to go to,
so return your tuxes.

933
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:40,676
No!

934
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,511
- No. Hell, no.
- Fine, keep your tuxes,

935
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:43,846
but my wedding's off.

936
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:45,806
It's not a shock, right?

937
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:49,602
I mean, buddy, I love you,
you're one of my best friends,

938
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:52,229
but you're a six and she's a...

939
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:54,106
Twenty.

940
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,525
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- He can hear you.

941
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:58,569
Oh, I'm feeling... I'm feeling weak.

942
00:37:58,653 --> 00:38:00,199
- I'm feeling dizzy, I'm...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

943
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:02,198
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Oh, my God.

944
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:04,659
I knew I shouldn't date out of my league,
I knew it.

945
00:38:04,742 --> 00:38:07,078
When she first asked me out,
I thought it was a prank.

946
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:10,081
I could feel her pulling away,
but I thought it was work.

947
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:11,752
- I'm gonna be sick.
- No, no, no.

948
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:13,254
- Give him some Madeira.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

949
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:15,419
- Yeah.
- Peter, that's it. Just take a sip.

950
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:17,466
- Chug-a-lug. Bup-bup-bup-bup.
- Oh, I'll get you a soft cheese!

951
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:18,547
Yes!

952
00:38:20,049 --> 00:38:21,467
This is so stupid.

953
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:25,221
Yeah, but this way no one can
definitively ID our face.

954
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:27,264
Old people. Perfect.

955
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:31,060
Any brand is fine.

956
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:32,520
What's that on your face?

957
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:33,980
A detoxifying mud mask.

958
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:36,148
Look, we need a burner phone, okay?

959
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:40,152
- Here's some cash.
- Again, a burner phone,

960
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:42,905
and you can find that behind the counter.

961
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,740
- Okay. We heard you.
- Inside.

962
00:38:44,824 --> 00:38:48,035
You baby boomers are so demanding.

963
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,412
I know.

964
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:51,747
- Jesus. Come on, Ma.
- I'm sick and tired of this shit.

965
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,278
I can't believe he's dead.

966
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:59,755
- And it's, like, all my fault.
- No, no.

967
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:02,717
It really is a tragedy, you know?

968
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:08,347
He could have been a scientist
that was gonna cure cancer or something.

969
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:11,934
- It's nice of you to say.
- Yeah.

970
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:15,604
Guys, is he looking, like, straight at me?

971
00:39:18,024 --> 00:39:19,525
- Oh, my God, he's...
- Yeah. Yeah.

972
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:21,569
He's looking at me, right?

973
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:22,862
Mmm-hmm.

974
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:27,199
Hi, baby boy.

975
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:29,702
Mummy Hubbard's here.

976
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:31,871
She's gonna send you home.

977
00:39:33,706 --> 00:39:35,207
Okay.

978
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:36,625
Sleep now.

979
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:39,920
Oh, no. Jesus, no. No, no, no.

980
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:41,717
- Okay, why don't we...
- I don't like it, I don't like it,

981
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:43,177
- I don't like it.
- Guys, I got it.

982
00:39:43,257 --> 00:39:44,884
- I got it.
- I'm done.

983
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:46,677
- I'm done.
- There we go.

984
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:48,471
He looks good, right?

985
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:51,182
Totally.

986
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,981
- Oh, my God, Jess.
- What?

987
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:00,524
Look at this ring.

988
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:02,943
It's even bigger in real life
than it is on Skype.

989
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:04,653
- Yeah, he did a good job.
- Oh.

990
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:06,363
You guys Skype?

991
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:08,324
- Yes.
- Oh, do we?

992
00:40:08,741 --> 00:40:09,825
Yes.

993
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:14,371
It's really nice to just sort of,
you know, see the person

994
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,499
when you're talking to them.

995
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:18,459
- I didn't know that.
- Yes.

996
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:19,877
You don't know Skype?

997
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,046
Skype is a free video calling app.

998
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:23,592
- You should...
- No, I know what Skype is.

999
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:25,883
Jess, you said you couldn't
remember your password.

1000
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:29,178
Well, it is really hard to sign in.

1001
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:33,432
- Oh, shit!
- Shit!

1002
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:35,476
- Whose dog is that?
- Go away! Go away!

1003
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:37,244
- Go! Go, go.
- Charlie? Here, boy!

1004
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:39,522
- The owner is coming towards the house.
- Oh, God.

1005
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:41,524
No, no, no. You're being too loud.

1006
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:43,946
I can speak to animals,
we have a deep understanding,

1007
00:40:44,026 --> 00:40:45,114
- so I got this.
- Charlie?

1008
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:46,699
- Just go!
- Okay, be careful, though.

1009
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:48,030
- Okay.
- Here, boy!

1010
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:50,324
Okay, Charlie. Come on.

1011
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:52,493
Come on, come on.

1012
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:54,203
- Aah! Ow! Aah!
- Oh, shit!

1013
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:56,038
Ow. Ow.

1014
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:57,543
- Charlie!
- You stay. I'm bringing him to you.

1015
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:59,670
This is impossible, anybody can see
into the house from the beach.

1016
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,168
- This is crazy.
- I know.

1017
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:03,212
If someone reports it
before we do, we're dead.

1018
00:41:03,546 --> 00:41:06,052
Well, we just... We have
to get the body out of sight, that's all.

1019
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:07,800
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

1020
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:08,971
- Okay.
- You all right?

1021
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:10,094
- You all right?
- Good.

1022
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:13,013
Oh, my God, Pip,
I can see all of his teeth marks.

1023
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:14,640
That looks really bad.

1024
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:16,475
No, no, no. This is...

1025
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:17,977
That's not... I'm good.

1026
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,770
Yeah, she's fine. Look at her in the eyes.

1027
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:22,398
Okay? So let's just get
the body out of sight,

1028
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:24,775
and then we'll put him back
before we call the cops. Yeah?

1029
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:26,026
- Let's do it. Right?
- Yes.

1030
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,945
- Let's go! Okay!
- Let's do it.

1031
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:29,867
Hold the door. Hang on one sec.

1032
00:41:29,947 --> 00:41:31,660
- Got it.
- There's two steps here. Hold on.

1033
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,580
- Yeah, we got it. Ow.
- Oh, there's two steps.

1034
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:35,664
- Put him down.
- That was me.

1035
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,249
Can somebody turn the lights on?

1036
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,123
- I'll get it.
- Oh, there we go.

1037
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:40,332
- That's better.
- Oh, God!

1038
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:42,459
Shit! Alice, cover the body!

1039
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:43,878
Why? Why? Why?

1040
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:45,462
Pippa, what did you do?

1041
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:48,340
This is a poltergeist situation.

1042
00:41:48,424 --> 00:41:49,842
I'm not doing anything.

1043
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:51,645
- All right.
- There's got to be a fuse box.

1044
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,556
- Oh, God. There is a taxi.
- Oh, no, no.

1045
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:57,016
There is a taxi right here.

1046
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:59,560
No! No, no, no.

1047
00:42:00,144 --> 00:42:01,228
No, thank you.

1048
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:02,918
- Cover the body.
- Hide me. Hide me.

1049
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:04,481
- Balls!
- Jesus Christ.

1050
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:06,442
Find a quilt. Find a fucking quilt.

1051
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:08,652
- What the...
- Jesus!

1052
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:11,697
- Oh, no. My water broke! My water broke!
- What?

1053
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,948
No, no, I just peed.

1054
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,040
- I have no control over this.
- Pippa.

1055
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:17,536
Close, you fuck.

1056
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,251
- Here you go, sir. Thank you.
- Thought I peed. I didn't pee.

1057
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:22,128
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Thank you.

1058
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:24,877
- Safe home!
- What the fuck is going on in here?

1059
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,966
We're starting a garage band.
Do you guys play bass?

1060
00:42:27,046 --> 00:42:28,968
We're hiding a body.
What do you think we're doing?

1061
00:42:29,048 --> 00:42:30,925
Stop saying "body" so many times.

1062
00:42:31,008 --> 00:42:32,388
- Alice, what the hell are you doing, man?
- Sorry.

1063
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:33,844
- Come on.
- God!

1064
00:42:33,928 --> 00:42:35,808
Lift him up with your legs.
Lift with your legs.

1065
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:38,269
I swear to God,
he's getting heavier every time.

1066
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:39,475
Just hold one second.

1067
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:40,896
- There's two stairs up here.
- No!

1068
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:42,857
- I got it.
- Let's take a break. Let's take a break.

1069
00:42:42,937 --> 00:42:43,979
Break, break, break.

1070
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:45,356
- No, no, no.
- Okay.

1071
00:42:45,481 --> 00:42:47,107
- Okay.
- I am out of shape.

1072
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:49,485
- Really good.
- Quick question.

1073
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:51,509
Why are we moving the dead stripper?

1074
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:54,240
The whole house is made out of glass.

1075
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:57,117
This is impossible.
You can see in everywhere.

1076
00:42:57,618 --> 00:42:59,870
Where could we put him
that he's not gonna be seen?

1077
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:13,596
So, what do you think, Uncle Jack?

1078
00:43:13,676 --> 00:43:16,428
They could charge you
with involuntary manslaughter,

1079
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:17,888
but it's not that easy to prove.

1080
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:19,640
- Ah, thank God.
- Well, that's not bad.

1081
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:21,312
- That's okay.
- Just don't touch the body

1082
00:43:21,392 --> 00:43:23,936
- or the scene, and you'll be fine.
- What?

1083
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:26,146
Okay, so actually,
we have already moved him

1084
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,439
to a sex swing, Your Honor.

1085
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:28,816
What?

1086
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:32,778
I said, "Actually, we have already
moved him to a sex swing, Your Honor."

1087
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:33,988
I heard you.

1088
00:43:35,197 --> 00:43:37,116
You knowingly tampered with the scene,

1089
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:39,451
which means you're guilty
of accessory after the fact,

1090
00:43:39,535 --> 00:43:43,872
and they'll have a strong case
for involuntary manslaughter.

1091
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:45,624
Wait, what does that mean?

1092
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,668
Up to 15 years in prison.

1093
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:50,170
- What?
- Fifteen?

1094
00:43:50,254 --> 00:43:52,965
- Well, what can we do?
- Are we on an open line here, girls?

1095
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:54,883
- It's a burner phone.
- Good.

1096
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,719
Like I told Rob Lowe,

1097
00:43:57,219 --> 00:44:00,889
if there's no body, there's no case.

1098
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,145
We can't just chop him up.

1099
00:44:06,812 --> 00:44:09,815
You know what?
I'll just tell the cops it was just me.

1100
00:44:10,232 --> 00:44:12,276
No, we all moved the body.

1101
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:14,320
It's a crime.

1102
00:44:14,403 --> 00:44:17,656
Well, yeah, but if we just,
like, explain the situation...

1103
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,700
What are you talking about,
"Explain"?

1104
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:22,453
Last year, a guy in Tampa,
he threatened to kill his wife,

1105
00:44:22,536 --> 00:44:23,871
so she fired a warning shot,

1106
00:44:23,954 --> 00:44:26,081
and she went to jail for 20 years.

1107
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:29,418
This country
should be burned to the ground!

1108
00:44:31,587 --> 00:44:33,047
Shit.

1109
00:44:34,548 --> 00:44:36,592
I was so close. Peter.

1110
00:44:37,301 --> 00:44:38,761
My career.

1111
00:44:38,886 --> 00:44:40,429
It's all over, just like that.

1112
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:43,515
I'm gonna do real time.

1113
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:44,933
Maybe life.

1114
00:44:45,017 --> 00:44:46,480
You guys are gonna get
off with a few years.

1115
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,438
I can't do any years.
I'm in the middle of a custody battle.

1116
00:44:49,772 --> 00:44:50,734
- What?
- What?

1117
00:44:50,814 --> 00:44:51,857
What?

1118
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:56,153
Malcolm and I separated six months ago.

1119
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:58,364
You didn't tell me.

1120
00:44:59,156 --> 00:45:01,075
Yeah, you've been a
little preoccupied, Jess.

1121
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:03,702
Why didn't you tell me?

1122
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:06,163
I didn't need your judgment.

1123
00:45:06,455 --> 00:45:08,707
Blair, I would never judge you
for something like that.

1124
00:45:10,501 --> 00:45:13,420
Oh, my God, my students.

1125
00:45:13,504 --> 00:45:15,297
They idolize me.

1126
00:45:15,381 --> 00:45:18,550
They think I'm, like,
the best fucking adult

1127
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:21,053
in the whole fucking world.

1128
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:22,554
They'll turn to crime.

1129
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:24,807
I can't go to jail.

1130
00:45:24,932 --> 00:45:26,770
I couldn't even make it
through the first episode

1131
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,143
of Orange Is the New Black.

1132
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:29,978
None of us can.

1133
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:32,231
It's too soapy, right?

1134
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:35,234
No, I meant none of us can go to jail.

1135
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:36,485
Wait, you guys.

1136
00:45:36,777 --> 00:45:39,780
Even if we don't get charged
with this tampering with evidence thing,

1137
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:41,407
we don't know who this man is.

1138
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,242
His family could come seek revenge.

1139
00:45:43,325 --> 00:45:46,120
He could be part of a cartel
that's gonna cut off our toes

1140
00:45:46,203 --> 00:45:47,249
and stick them up our bums.

1141
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:48,330
She's right.

1142
00:45:48,497 --> 00:45:51,017
We'll have to look over our shoulders
for the rest of our lives.

1143
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:54,002
He did say that

1144
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:57,756
it would be hard to convict

1145
00:45:58,674 --> 00:46:00,843
with no body.

1146
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:04,388
I mean, it was an accident.

1147
00:46:04,638 --> 00:46:06,640
And he's not part
of an escort company, you know?

1148
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:08,517
So I don't think anybody knows he's here.

1149
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:10,894
Mmm-hmm.

1150
00:46:15,357 --> 00:46:16,692
We got to get rid of him.

1151
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:17,985
- We gotta, right?
- Yeah.

1152
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:19,194
- We do.
- We have to.

1153
00:46:19,278 --> 00:46:21,492
- I mean, we don't want to.
- No, of course we don't want to.

1154
00:46:21,572 --> 00:46:22,739
We didn't want to kill him.

1155
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:24,119
- We have no other option.
- But we have to.

1156
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:25,454
- Of course we have to.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1157
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:26,535
Must.

1158
00:46:28,745 --> 00:46:30,865
Hey, it's Blair.
Don't leave a message.

1159
00:46:30,998 --> 00:46:33,625
Okay. That's it.
None of them are picking up.

1160
00:46:33,709 --> 00:46:35,172
That means something really bad happened.

1161
00:46:35,252 --> 00:46:39,006
Dude, this is, like, the third girlfriend
that's cheated on you.

1162
00:46:39,423 --> 00:46:41,467
What is that? What's going on, buddy?

1163
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:43,635
Does your dick bend weird
when it gets hard?

1164
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:44,761
No.

1165
00:46:44,887 --> 00:46:46,388
- All right.
- Doesn't matter.

1166
00:46:46,722 --> 00:46:49,725
Let's get you on Tinder right now,
so you can start on a rebound.

1167
00:46:49,892 --> 00:46:52,561
- No, I don't want to be on Tinder, okay?
- Come on.

1168
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:55,189
You've gotten over other girls,
you can get over her.

1169
00:46:55,272 --> 00:46:59,193
Yeah, this isn't some girl, this is Jess.
I'm not gonna get over her, you know?

1170
00:46:59,276 --> 00:47:00,572
And I don't want to get over her.

1171
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:02,452
Then, this time,
do something about it, Peter.

1172
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:08,285
You're right.

1173
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:10,999
You're right, I got to go to Miami,
and I got to win her back.

1174
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:13,499
- Yes, dude. Yes. Awesome.
- Okay, okay.

1175
00:47:13,582 --> 00:47:17,461
The first flight out of Charleston
gets in at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

1176
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:18,674
- No.
- Oh. There is a train

1177
00:47:18,754 --> 00:47:22,174
that gets there tomorrow afternoon
and there's room in the quiet car.

1178
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:24,426
Not quick enough. You got to sad astronaut.

1179
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:27,095
- What?
- Huh?

1180
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,139
He has to sad astronaut.

1181
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:30,727
- Okay, what is that?
- That's nothing to me.

1182
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:32,684
- Sad astronaut?
- That news story?

1183
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:34,937
Okay.

1184
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:37,606
Lisa Marie Nowak was an astronaut.

1185
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:42,110
And she was in love
with another astronaut named Will.

1186
00:47:42,736 --> 00:47:45,739
Now, Will cheated on Lisa
with some hottie Air Force captain.

1187
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:48,951
Lisa found out and was pissed.

1188
00:47:49,326 --> 00:47:51,787
So, Lisa decided to deal with it.

1189
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:55,541
Once and for all.
And she got a bunch of adult diapers,

1190
00:47:55,874 --> 00:47:57,474
so she wouldn't have to piss on the way,

1191
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:59,753
and she drove straight from
Houston to Orlando

1192
00:47:59,962 --> 00:48:04,132
to, like, kidnap the Air Force...
It's... The story gets dark quick.

1193
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:08,428
Point is, she used that crazy
astrophysicist brain

1194
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:10,556
to find the quickest way to Florida.

1195
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:14,268
- You... You want to get Jess back, right?
- Yeah.

1196
00:48:14,977 --> 00:48:17,771
Then you got to sad astronaut, bro.

1197
00:48:19,356 --> 00:48:21,149
Let's get some diapers.

1198
00:48:21,233 --> 00:48:22,651
La-da-da-da-dah

1199
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:24,736
It's the motherfuckin' D-O-double-G

1200
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,321
Snoop Dogg!

1201
00:48:26,405 --> 00:48:28,699
La-da-da-da-dah, you know I'm mobbin'

1202
00:48:28,824 --> 00:48:30,409
With the D-R-E

1203
00:48:30,492 --> 00:48:32,452
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know who's back

1204
00:48:32,536 --> 00:48:34,663
Up in this motherfucker?

1205
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:36,540
What, what, what, what...

1206
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:38,875
Not this brand! These leak!

1207
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:50,470
La-da-da-da-dah

1208
00:48:50,554 --> 00:48:52,514
It's the motherfuckin' D-R-E

1209
00:48:52,598 --> 00:48:54,102
- Dr. Dre, motherfucker
- What, what, what, what

1210
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:55,434
La-da-da-da-dah

1211
00:48:55,517 --> 00:48:57,936
You know I'm mobbin' with the D-O-double-G

1212
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,314
Straight off the fuckin' streets of C-P-T

1213
00:49:00,397 --> 00:49:02,190
King of the beats, you ride to 'em

1214
00:49:02,274 --> 00:49:03,567
- In your Fleet
- Fleetwood

1215
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,777
Or Coupe de Ville rollin' on dubs

1216
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:08,113
How you feel? Whoopty-whoop, nigga, what?

1217
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:09,531
It's the next episode

1218
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:13,577
- Jesus Christ.
- It's not that bad.

1219
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:16,330
I think it's the body on top.

1220
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:18,290
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Okay.

1221
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:21,793
Okay, wait, does anyone know
how to actually drive this thing, or...

1222
00:49:21,877 --> 00:49:22,878
I could do it.

1223
00:49:23,045 --> 00:49:28,216
I, uh, I took one to school every day
growing up, so, I feel pretty confident.

1224
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,426
- Great.
- Perfect.

1225
00:49:30,552 --> 00:49:31,678
- Hello!
- Oh, shit.

1226
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,681
- Hello!
- Oh, my gosh. Shit!

1227
00:49:34,765 --> 00:49:36,061
- The neighbors!
- Get him off. Get him off.

1228
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:37,479
Okay, oh, my God, oh, my God,
what do we do?

1229
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:39,353
- No, no... Okay. All right.
- No, no!

1230
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:44,274
- So happy to see you.
- Okay, uh...

1231
00:49:44,441 --> 00:49:46,360
- Nope.
- Dang.

1232
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:48,820
We hoped you were skinny-dipping.

1233
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:50,530
- No.
- No.

1234
00:49:50,614 --> 00:49:51,657
- Nope.
- Okay.

1235
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:54,743
- My, my.
- What do we have here?

1236
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:56,662
Oh.

1237
00:49:56,745 --> 00:49:58,330
- Oh.
- Oh, wow.

1238
00:49:58,413 --> 00:50:02,709
Um, you know, I think they just wanted
to make love in international waters.

1239
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:05,253
- Ah, yeah.
- Maybe they need our help.

1240
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:09,549
Uh, no. I think we should probably let them
do their thing, you know?

1241
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,218
So, let's just...

1242
00:50:11,635 --> 00:50:13,720
Well, this certainly gets me in the mood.

1243
00:50:14,388 --> 00:50:15,806
- Hey, Blair.
- Oh. Uh-huh?

1244
00:50:15,889 --> 00:50:19,142
- You need a tampon?
- Um, maybe.

1245
00:50:19,226 --> 00:50:21,520
We just opened
a bottle of Chateauneuf Du Pape,

1246
00:50:21,603 --> 00:50:24,231
and we're listening to some
remastered Fleetwood Mac.

1247
00:50:24,356 --> 00:50:26,942
- Oh, that's so nice.
- Oh! It is so good,

1248
00:50:27,025 --> 00:50:29,361
you could hear the cocaine
in Stevie's voice.

1249
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:30,741
- I bet.
- We'd love for you to join us.

1250
00:50:30,821 --> 00:50:32,739
- Oh, that's so sweet.
- Um, no pressure.

1251
00:50:32,823 --> 00:50:35,075
Unless it's asked for.

1252
00:50:35,325 --> 00:50:37,327
Okay.

1253
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:39,371
I am fully exhausted.

1254
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:41,581
- So tired, you know?
- Oh, understood.

1255
00:50:41,665 --> 00:50:43,333
We're fluent in body language.

1256
00:50:43,417 --> 00:50:44,918
Oh, I bet you are.

1257
00:50:47,671 --> 00:50:49,089
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1258
00:50:49,297 --> 00:50:51,133
All right.

1259
00:50:53,802 --> 00:50:54,845
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.

1260
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:56,683
- Pippa. They're gone. Pippa.
- They're moving out.

1261
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:58,348
- What is going on there?
- Pippa!

1262
00:50:58,432 --> 00:50:59,641
- Pippa!
- What?

1263
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:01,351
Oh, my God. Wow.

1264
00:51:01,435 --> 00:51:02,811
Yeah. Okay.

1265
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,565
- Sorry.
- Wow, dude.

1266
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:08,362
- Let's dump him, yeah?
- Yeah, let's dump him.

1267
00:51:08,442 --> 00:51:09,651
Let's do the dump.

1268
00:51:15,574 --> 00:51:18,034
- Oof.
- Okay, Spanish language CDs.

1269
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,790
Uh, if Jess hooked up
with a Spanish speaker,

1270
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:21,830
- you're gonna want to reason with him.
- Gracias.

1271
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:24,085
Oh, um, and I got this
generic Russian Adderall.

1272
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:25,587
My little brother ordered it online.

1273
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:26,877
It will help you focus.

1274
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,963
It's super strong, but it is expired, so...

1275
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:31,465
- Thank you so much.
- Hey.

1276
00:51:31,548 --> 00:51:32,969
- I love you.
- I love you, too, dude.

1277
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:35,302
- Get her back.
- Thanks.

1278
00:51:36,011 --> 00:51:38,096
Mmm...

1279
00:51:38,305 --> 00:51:39,556
You are peeing.

1280
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:41,141
I'm so scared.

1281
00:51:42,851 --> 00:51:45,562
I feel like we should say something.

1282
00:51:45,854 --> 00:51:47,334
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Good idea.

1283
00:51:48,523 --> 00:51:50,233
We're really sorry.

1284
00:51:50,734 --> 00:51:51,902
You deserved better.

1285
00:51:51,985 --> 00:51:53,240
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

1286
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,031
There's nothing we could do
to bring you back, but...

1287
00:51:56,364 --> 00:51:59,826
We promise to spend the rest of our lives
trying to be better people.

1288
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:04,206
- We owe that to you.
- Mmm-hmm.

1289
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:06,583
God, we're so sorry.

1290
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:08,335
So sorry.

1291
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:09,878
So sorry, man.

1292
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,671
We suck.

1293
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:17,302
Okay, you can dump him now!

1294
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:19,304
Aye aye, Captain.

1295
00:52:24,017 --> 00:52:26,102
This never happened. Right?

1296
00:52:26,853 --> 00:52:28,814
- Nope.
- It... It happened.

1297
00:52:29,105 --> 00:52:30,273
Right?

1298
00:52:30,899 --> 00:52:33,180
- No, we're not gonna talk about it.
- Oh, got it, got it.

1299
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,613
Okay, bye.

1300
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:37,864
- Oh.
- Whoa.

1301
00:52:37,948 --> 00:52:40,158
That could have been more delicate, huh?

1302
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:44,996
She's going really fast.

1303
00:52:45,622 --> 00:52:46,748
I did it!

1304
00:52:46,832 --> 00:52:49,584
- Oh, my God, what the fuck is she doing?
- What is she doing?

1305
00:52:50,502 --> 00:52:52,712
Holy shit!

1306
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,632
- Oh, my God!
- Are you okay?

1307
00:52:56,424 --> 00:52:58,260
I'm good. I'm really good.

1308
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,680
Are you sure,
'cause you landed right on your neck.

1309
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:04,891
Yeah, I just did a sort of straight shot,
landed on the neck...

1310
00:53:04,975 --> 00:53:06,726
snap, and we're back up.

1311
00:53:07,143 --> 00:53:08,273
- It was good.
- What happened?

1312
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:09,775
I thought you knew
how to drive those things.

1313
00:53:09,855 --> 00:53:13,567
Yeah, no, I definitely do, but, um,
I think the gas and the brake are different

1314
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:15,363
in Australia, so I got confused.

1315
00:53:15,443 --> 00:53:18,363
- How are you alive right now?
- I don't know.

1316
00:53:18,488 --> 00:53:20,115
But I'll take it.

1317
00:53:22,534 --> 00:53:24,911
Well, body dumped, girl's alive.

1318
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:27,914
- What's next?
- We should get the fuck out of here.

1319
00:53:27,998 --> 00:53:29,583
- Great idea.
- Yeah, I like that.

1320
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:32,335
- Let's do that.
- You sure you're okay?

1321
00:53:36,756 --> 00:53:37,757
Guys?

1322
00:53:38,174 --> 00:53:40,051
She should probably get a CAT scan.

1323
00:53:40,135 --> 00:53:41,261
Okay.

1324
00:53:43,013 --> 00:53:44,097
She's fine.

1325
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:50,061
- Is there any more pizza left?
- I don't think so.

1326
00:53:50,145 --> 00:53:51,146
No!

1327
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:52,731
Jesus, dude, we can order more.

1328
00:53:52,814 --> 00:53:54,441
No, not that. That!

1329
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:56,568
- What?
- The sexy neighbors!

1330
00:53:56,651 --> 00:53:58,651
- Oh...
- They have footage of us dumping the body.

1331
00:53:58,904 --> 00:54:00,572
We should just turn ourselves in, right?

1332
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:02,240
- We're fucked.
- No.

1333
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:05,330
We got rid of the body. We just have to
get rid of the footage, that's all.

1334
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:06,453
- Right?
- Yes.

1335
00:54:06,703 --> 00:54:07,871
- Yep. Yep.
- Yeah, okay.

1336
00:54:07,954 --> 00:54:09,664
- Yes.
- Well, how?

1337
00:54:10,123 --> 00:54:12,667
Um...

1338
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:16,504
No.

1339
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:18,298
Absolutely not.

1340
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:19,758
Thank you. Oh.

1341
00:54:19,841 --> 00:54:21,843
Make love to me

1342
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:26,514
Mmm.

1343
00:54:27,265 --> 00:54:29,017
Your house is so, um...

1344
00:54:30,727 --> 00:54:32,854
- Funky.
- Thank you.

1345
00:54:33,146 --> 00:54:34,346
You should see our panic room.

1346
00:54:39,653 --> 00:54:40,737
Mmm.

1347
00:54:41,071 --> 00:54:42,238
May I?

1348
00:54:42,906 --> 00:54:44,366
Uh-huh. Mmm-hmm.

1349
00:54:49,287 --> 00:54:52,123
It's happening. God, you make me red-hot.

1350
00:55:03,468 --> 00:55:06,638
You know what would be
really, really sexy?

1351
00:55:07,013 --> 00:55:08,223
Please tell me.

1352
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:10,016
If we got this on tape.

1353
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:14,104
Oh, you naughty girl.

1354
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:15,730
- Mmm-hmm.
- Ooh.

1355
00:55:15,897 --> 00:55:17,315
Oh!

1356
00:55:17,399 --> 00:55:21,987
Actually, I noticed that you guys have
these cameras outside and it's always been

1357
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:26,241
a fantasy of mine to get caught
on a security camera, so...

1358
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:30,078
Mesdemoiselles?

1359
00:55:30,954 --> 00:55:32,414
Oh, okay. Okay.

1360
00:55:35,667 --> 00:55:36,835
Thank you.

1361
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:44,050
It's all I can do to see this through

1362
00:55:45,552 --> 00:55:47,804
See it through

1363
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:49,014
Okay.

1364
00:55:49,097 --> 00:55:51,975
It's all that I want

1365
00:55:52,934 --> 00:55:56,146
- Oh, okay. Yeah.
- Is it okay that we're watching this?

1366
00:55:56,563 --> 00:56:00,316
Yeah, we're watching for Blair.
You know, for her safety. We're monitoring.

1367
00:56:00,442 --> 00:56:02,777
- Man, Blair looks great.
- Yeah, she looks great.

1368
00:56:03,153 --> 00:56:05,363
- You ready?
- Uh...

1369
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:07,866
- Yeah, think so.
- All right.

1370
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:11,953
- Oh!
- Relax.

1371
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:13,663
- Oh!
- I've got you.

1372
00:56:13,997 --> 00:56:15,415
- Holy shit!
- Oh, my...

1373
00:56:15,623 --> 00:56:17,917
- Interesting.
- She's showing off. To me.

1374
00:56:18,251 --> 00:56:19,669
- Yes! Yes!
- Whoa.

1375
00:56:19,753 --> 00:56:21,004
Give me those. Give me those.

1376
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:24,966
Oh...

1377
00:56:25,133 --> 00:56:28,470
Sadness, look at us now

1378
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:33,308
The best of me, sadness

1379
00:56:34,851 --> 00:56:36,691
Hey,
it's Jess. Leave a message.

1380
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,396
Jess, it's Peter.

1381
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:41,816
How are you? Um...

1382
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:46,988
Just calling again. Okay.
Oh, man.

1383
00:56:47,405 --> 00:56:49,074
What a story this'll be, huh?

1384
00:56:49,574 --> 00:56:51,659
For the grand kids. If we get married.

1385
00:56:51,868 --> 00:56:54,954
Um, do me a favor, call me back.
Let me know you're okay.

1386
00:56:55,163 --> 00:56:57,582
Got burned but I learned
it was all for the better

1387
00:56:57,916 --> 00:57:00,001
I love you so much. Please call me. Bye.

1388
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:03,797
Back together, never thought
I could take all the wrongs

1389
00:57:03,922 --> 00:57:07,008
And turn them to right

1390
00:57:08,259 --> 00:57:11,763
Tonight

1391
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:14,974
Sadness, look at us now

1392
00:57:17,018 --> 00:57:18,773
Hey,
it's Jess. Leave a message.

1393
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:20,939
Jess!

1394
00:57:21,314 --> 00:57:22,440
Yes!

1395
00:57:28,238 --> 00:57:30,240
- Ho!
- Oh.

1396
00:57:30,323 --> 00:57:34,202
Um, I would love
a copy of the tape, you know,

1397
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:37,122
for, like, jerking off later, whatever.

1398
00:57:37,622 --> 00:57:39,332
Me, too. What's the tape?

1399
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:42,877
The tape. The, uh...
The naughty tape we just made.

1400
00:57:42,961 --> 00:57:44,504
You know, the DVD or the...

1401
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:46,589
You know, from the cameras.

1402
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:49,217
Oh. Those don't work.

1403
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:52,720
- Excuse me, what?
- Yeah, they don't work, like she said.

1404
00:57:52,846 --> 00:57:54,889
But we know that's not what this was about.

1405
00:57:54,973 --> 00:57:56,766
Right? This was fantasy fulfillment.

1406
00:57:57,308 --> 00:57:59,727
- Creating a mise en scène.
- I'm sorry. Why, um...

1407
00:58:01,271 --> 00:58:04,232
Why would someone have
security cameras that don't work?

1408
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:05,904
They didn't charge us
for the first three months.

1409
00:58:05,984 --> 00:58:07,572
After that, we didn't want
to pay for the service.

1410
00:58:07,652 --> 00:58:09,332
You know, they keep out the riffraff.

1411
00:58:09,445 --> 00:58:11,823
You'll just have to jerk
off as the Italians do.

1412
00:58:12,365 --> 00:58:13,992
- To your memories.
- Mmm.

1413
00:58:16,578 --> 00:58:20,290
Wait, so, Blair, so there's no footage?

1414
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:22,500
No.

1415
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:24,961
- Ah!
- Oh, my gosh. So we're in the clear!

1416
00:58:25,044 --> 00:58:26,921
That is... That's great.

1417
00:58:27,005 --> 00:58:29,424
- Yeah.
- She was so intuitive.

1418
00:58:31,426 --> 00:58:33,636
She was inside me.

1419
00:58:34,637 --> 00:58:36,181
And then she was outside me.

1420
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:40,143
And then she was me.

1421
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:44,898
- So, we're good.
- Almost, except I probably have HPV now.

1422
00:58:45,315 --> 00:58:46,441
Whatever. We all have HPV.

1423
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:48,985
Oh, uh, I mean, I don't have HPV.

1424
00:58:49,485 --> 00:58:54,115
Alice, they say if you had sex
after the year 1991, you have HPV.

1425
00:58:54,782 --> 00:58:56,743
Then, I mean, I definitely have HPV then.

1426
00:58:56,993 --> 00:58:59,037
I have, like, clumps and clumps of it.

1427
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:03,041
Cool. Uh, let's clean up
and get the hell out of here.

1428
00:59:03,249 --> 00:59:04,609
- Okay.
- Whatcha, whatcha gon' do?

1429
00:59:05,084 --> 00:59:06,586
I call it housework

1430
00:59:06,669 --> 00:59:08,630
'Cause it's light work

1431
00:59:08,713 --> 00:59:10,260
- Whatcha, whatcha gon' do?
- I'm-a throw shapes

1432
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,258
Feeling the bass till my feet hurt

1433
00:59:12,675 --> 00:59:15,970
I call it housework, 'cause it's light work

1434
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,059
- Whatcha, whatcha gon' do?
- But I'm-a throw shade

1435
00:59:18,139 --> 00:59:19,933
If I don't get paid for this housework

1436
00:59:20,433 --> 00:59:21,976
Would you come along

1437
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,770
Oh, with my friends

1438
00:59:23,853 --> 00:59:25,855
And to leave, I'm working

1439
00:59:26,314 --> 00:59:28,441
- Every weekend
- Housework

1440
00:59:28,691 --> 00:59:29,692
Wow.

1441
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:31,569
- Okay.
- Looks pretty good.

1442
00:59:31,653 --> 00:59:33,029
- We did good.
- Got it.

1443
00:59:33,112 --> 00:59:36,074
- Yes. Nice. High five, everyone.
- Lovely.

1444
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:38,618
Whatcha gon' do, gon' do?

1445
00:59:44,123 --> 00:59:46,209
This child is not my son.

1446
00:59:53,383 --> 00:59:55,468
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1447
00:59:59,222 --> 01:00:01,307
Shit. My pants.

1448
01:00:05,228 --> 01:00:07,188
I don't have time for this.

1449
01:00:16,781 --> 01:00:18,032
Good evening, Officer.

1450
01:00:18,157 --> 01:00:19,659
How can I be of service to you?

1451
01:00:20,201 --> 01:00:22,161
- Sir, you been drinking?
- Absolutely not.

1452
01:00:22,453 --> 01:00:25,123
I did do a wine tasting earlier this evening,
Italian reds mostly,

1453
01:00:25,206 --> 01:00:26,794
but you don't really drink it,
you mostly spit.

1454
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:28,171
You take sips and you spit into a bucket.

1455
01:00:28,251 --> 01:00:30,673
What the... All right, sir, I'm gonna ask
you to get out of the vehicle.

1456
01:00:30,753 --> 01:00:31,838
- No.
- Now!

1457
01:00:31,921 --> 01:00:33,214
- Officer...
- Now!

1458
01:00:33,423 --> 01:00:35,258
Hands. Move slow.

1459
01:00:42,307 --> 01:00:43,599
Officer, I can explain.

1460
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:45,393
She's a 20!

1461
01:00:46,519 --> 01:00:47,603
Okay, before we go,

1462
01:00:48,021 --> 01:00:49,525
we got to do human friendtipede, yeah?

1463
01:00:49,605 --> 01:00:50,648
- What?
- Alice.

1464
01:00:50,732 --> 01:00:52,025
- No way.
- Yes.

1465
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:54,902
- It's tradition.
- Alice, quick "Q."

1466
01:00:55,528 --> 01:00:57,238
What is a human friendtipede?

1467
01:00:57,447 --> 01:01:00,408
It's a photo we always take
that's like the movie Human Centipede.

1468
01:01:00,575 --> 01:01:03,995
Where they're sewn together,
mouth to anus, but it's with friends,

1469
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,331
- so it's special.
- Come on now, Alice.

1470
01:01:06,456 --> 01:01:08,419
- I don't know about that.
- I feel like not the appropriate...

1471
01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:11,336
Guys, if I don't post a ton of pictures
from this weekend,

1472
01:01:11,502 --> 01:01:12,920
it's gonna look suspicious.

1473
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,213
Like we killed someone.

1474
01:01:14,797 --> 01:01:17,008
Okay.
I can't believe I'm saying this,

1475
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:18,680
but I think we should
do the human friendtipede.

1476
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,929
- Yes!
- But we cannot photograph the crime scene.

1477
01:01:22,013 --> 01:01:23,598
Okay. I get the middle.

1478
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:26,476
Why do you want the middle?

1479
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:29,145
Okay. Oh, my God, amazoir.

1480
01:01:29,771 --> 01:01:31,439
Say "friendtipede."

1481
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:32,982
Friendtipede!

1482
01:01:33,483 --> 01:01:35,651
Cute.

1483
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:37,528
Yes!

1484
01:01:37,612 --> 01:01:39,322
- Let's see it.
- It's ridiculous.

1485
01:01:40,573 --> 01:01:43,743
- Alice, stop. You look really pretty.
- No, look!

1486
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,582
- Oh, my God.
- No! Come on! No!

1487
01:01:50,083 --> 01:01:52,335
- Oh, shit! Damn it!
- Is that our guy?

1488
01:01:53,544 --> 01:01:55,129
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh, shit!

1489
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:56,798
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

1490
01:01:57,006 --> 01:01:59,092
God,
I thought you weighed him down.

1491
01:01:59,217 --> 01:02:02,387
I did. I put rocks in his pockets.
I guess his pants fell off.

1492
01:02:02,553 --> 01:02:04,222
Men need to wear belts.

1493
01:02:04,347 --> 01:02:06,808
Yeah. How dare they not sink
when we murder them.

1494
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:11,229
Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T, S, R, Q, P, O,

1495
01:02:11,312 --> 01:02:15,066
N, M, L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A.

1496
01:02:24,784 --> 01:02:25,910
Okay.

1497
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:33,292
Did you see that?

1498
01:02:34,544 --> 01:02:38,965
- You only had to walk a straight line.
- I know. I just followed my body.

1499
01:02:39,382 --> 01:02:40,967
- Are you a dancer or...
- No.

1500
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:43,130
I've never done anything
like that before in my life.

1501
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:45,099
I still got to give you a speeding ticket.

1502
01:02:45,179 --> 01:02:46,806
Please. That's great.

1503
01:02:47,265 --> 01:02:48,349
Slow down.

1504
01:02:48,641 --> 01:02:50,518
- Thank you, Officer.
- I almost shot you.

1505
01:02:50,643 --> 01:02:53,855
I know. That was nuts.
Also, don't shoot anybody.

1506
01:02:56,899 --> 01:02:59,113
We can't get rid of his body
in broad daylight, you guys.

1507
01:02:59,193 --> 01:03:01,195
We have to think of something. Come on.

1508
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,780
Ideas?

1509
01:03:02,864 --> 01:03:04,449
Kiwi! You up?

1510
01:03:04,532 --> 01:03:05,908
Yeah. Yeah.

1511
01:03:05,992 --> 01:03:09,120
- We need everyone's brain on this, so...
- Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

1512
01:03:09,454 --> 01:03:11,873
So, um, here's what I'm gonna do.

1513
01:03:12,206 --> 01:03:13,708
I'm gonna go to the beach

1514
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,960
and do a bit of mindful meditation.

1515
01:03:16,169 --> 01:03:18,212
And, um, when I come back,

1516
01:03:18,337 --> 01:03:20,131
I'm gonna have a be-genius idea.

1517
01:03:20,673 --> 01:03:22,758
Yeah? All right.

1518
01:03:23,301 --> 01:03:24,760
We got it.

1519
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:27,930
We're never gonna
get rid of his body.

1520
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:30,634
He's gonna follow us around
for the rest of our lives.

1521
01:03:30,725 --> 01:03:32,310
- Oh, God.
- Oh, no.

1522
01:03:32,477 --> 01:03:33,481
Police!

1523
01:03:33,561 --> 01:03:35,813
- Shit.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1524
01:03:35,897 --> 01:03:38,319
Do you think the neighbors called them?
Maybe they got suspicious.

1525
01:03:38,399 --> 01:03:40,109
- Oh, my God.
- Police! Open up! Now!

1526
01:03:40,359 --> 01:03:43,529
Women, this is my world.
I will handle this. I got you.

1527
01:03:44,197 --> 01:03:45,531
Turn out the lights and hide.

1528
01:03:57,919 --> 01:04:01,297
Oh, good evening, Officer.

1529
01:04:01,631 --> 01:04:02,882
Step aside, miss.

1530
01:04:03,216 --> 01:04:04,717
What's this all about?

1531
01:04:05,009 --> 01:04:06,305
Put your hands where I can see them.

1532
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:10,056
Officer, I am cooperating.
You see? Hello.

1533
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:11,474
Get your hands against the wall.

1534
01:04:11,557 --> 01:04:12,687
- I am not...
- Get your hands against the wall!

1535
01:04:12,767 --> 01:04:14,810
I am taking a passive stance.

1536
01:04:14,894 --> 01:04:16,687
My body is limp for you!

1537
01:04:17,063 --> 01:04:18,439
Spread them.

1538
01:04:23,444 --> 01:04:25,530
What are you doing? No.

1539
01:04:25,988 --> 01:04:27,281
No! No!

1540
01:04:29,367 --> 01:04:31,202
- Fuck!
- Jesus!

1541
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:35,164
- Frankie! Frankie!
- Oh, my God.

1542
01:04:35,456 --> 01:04:37,708
Now we have a dead guy
and an unconscious cop?

1543
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:39,464
- What is wrong with you?
- Are you kidding me?

1544
01:04:39,544 --> 01:04:42,338
He's obviously a rape cop.
This is what they do!

1545
01:04:42,547 --> 01:04:44,302
When they have dirt on you,
they sexually assault you,

1546
01:04:44,382 --> 01:04:45,675
knowing you won't report it.

1547
01:04:45,925 --> 01:04:48,386
- Daniel Holtzclaw, Oklahoma City?
- Who?

1548
01:04:48,636 --> 01:04:50,221
He sexually assaulted eight women.

1549
01:04:50,972 --> 01:04:52,848
Like Matt Dillon in Crash.

1550
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,768
- Oh, my God, that was horrendous.
- What a nightmare.

1551
01:04:55,851 --> 01:04:58,229
Information is power, guys.
I mean it. I mean it.

1552
01:04:58,312 --> 01:04:59,609
Okay, chill out. You're from Brentwood,

1553
01:04:59,689 --> 01:05:01,569
and your dad used to be
John Mayer's accountant.

1554
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:05,570
Okay. "You are not your father's daughters
but mothers unto your own."

1555
01:05:05,653 --> 01:05:06,946
Wait, is that John Mayer?

1556
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,990
It's Malcolm X.

1557
01:05:09,699 --> 01:05:11,412
- Pretty sure it's John Mayer.
- Fathers, fathers

1558
01:05:11,492 --> 01:05:13,289
Okay, you guys, you guys,
we have to move this guy

1559
01:05:13,369 --> 01:05:15,913
before the neighbors return
to eat Blair out again.

1560
01:05:16,163 --> 01:05:17,999
I'd be fine with that.

1561
01:05:18,082 --> 01:05:19,292
- All right.
- Fuck.

1562
01:05:19,375 --> 01:05:21,294
All right, one, two, three.

1563
01:05:25,298 --> 01:05:26,299
Uh...

1564
01:05:27,341 --> 01:05:30,803
Frankie, how many strippers did you order?

1565
01:05:32,221 --> 01:05:33,514
Just the one.

1566
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:36,267
Then who's this guy?

1567
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:39,315
- Let me see his dick real quick.
- Good call.

1568
01:05:39,395 --> 01:05:41,814
- Wait, what?
- The stripper I ordered had a dick pic

1569
01:05:41,897 --> 01:05:43,399
in his ad. No face.

1570
01:05:43,482 --> 01:05:46,861
- But I can ID him by his member.
- Cool. Okay.

1571
01:05:51,699 --> 01:05:53,075
I'm not sure.

1572
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:54,744
He had a boner in his ad.

1573
01:05:54,827 --> 01:05:56,203
This one's soft.

1574
01:05:56,621 --> 01:05:59,457
I can get it hard. Let's go, feet.

1575
01:05:59,749 --> 01:06:02,069
- What? No. No, no, no, no.
- Stop. No, wait. Stop, please.

1576
01:06:08,007 --> 01:06:10,176
Okay, yes. This is the stripper I ordered.

1577
01:06:10,635 --> 01:06:12,219
This is Scotty with the Body.

1578
01:06:13,596 --> 01:06:14,889
Then who did we kill?

1579
01:06:38,788 --> 01:06:40,706
- Hello?
- This is Banknorth.

1580
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:43,292
We have detected unusual activity
on your account.

1581
01:06:43,542 --> 01:06:45,044
If you have attempted a purchase at

1582
01:06:45,127 --> 01:06:48,339
Quickie Stop in Port St. Lucie,
please press one.

1583
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:52,343
Thank you for pressing two.

1584
01:06:52,677 --> 01:06:55,054
Your card has been suspended
due to unusual activity.

1585
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:56,430
No. No.

1586
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:01,435
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1587
01:07:11,737 --> 01:07:13,457
- How's that?
- Yeah, that's good.

1588
01:07:15,282 --> 01:07:17,455
If you're looking for our cell phones,
I locked them in this drawer

1589
01:07:17,535 --> 01:07:18,815
and I'm not gonna open it, okay?

1590
01:07:19,078 --> 01:07:22,707
Please let me at least text Peter. I feel
like he's totally freaking out right now.

1591
01:07:22,832 --> 01:07:24,420
Not until
everything is sorted out.

1592
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,751
We made a plan.

1593
01:07:26,544 --> 01:07:28,045
Um, Alice.

1594
01:07:28,129 --> 01:07:29,929
- What's up, dude? What are you doing?
- What?

1595
01:07:30,548 --> 01:07:32,633
Oh, I'm just making sure nothing's broken.

1596
01:07:33,008 --> 01:07:34,260
I think he's fine.

1597
01:07:34,552 --> 01:07:35,845
Yeah, he's really fine.

1598
01:07:36,178 --> 01:07:37,430
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

1599
01:07:37,513 --> 01:07:40,808
You need to masturbate more.
You're, like, severely horny.

1600
01:07:41,016 --> 01:07:44,311
I know. I just don't like
to do it in front of my cockatiel.

1601
01:07:44,437 --> 01:07:45,771
She's very smart.

1602
01:07:46,105 --> 01:07:48,482
- Why don't you put her in a cage?
- She is in a cage.

1603
01:07:48,858 --> 01:07:50,484
But I'm loud. I'm a screamer.

1604
01:07:50,818 --> 01:07:52,490
- I remember.
- Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

1605
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:54,864
And it kind of sounds like her.

1606
01:07:55,281 --> 01:07:56,741
So she thinks I'm talking to her.

1607
01:07:57,491 --> 01:07:59,372
I'm like,
"No, I'm just fucking touching myself."

1608
01:07:59,452 --> 01:08:01,412
- Like, "Back off."
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

1609
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:03,622
Cool, so back to our
life-changing emergency?

1610
01:08:03,789 --> 01:08:06,959
Okay, the stripper's here, he's alive.

1611
01:08:07,251 --> 01:08:09,503
- That's good. Right?
- Yeah.

1612
01:08:10,087 --> 01:08:12,256
Um, there is still a dead guy
in the closet, so...

1613
01:08:12,339 --> 01:08:14,053
- Who is that guy?
- We could get rid

1614
01:08:14,133 --> 01:08:16,093
of him if we just had a car, you know?

1615
01:08:16,427 --> 01:08:18,429
Oh, my God. How did this guy get here?

1616
01:08:22,016 --> 01:08:23,517
Oh, yeah.

1617
01:08:23,851 --> 01:08:25,436
That'll work.

1618
01:08:26,228 --> 01:08:27,772
- Thank God!
- Will it?

1619
01:08:28,397 --> 01:08:31,108
All right, we're gonna drive
to the alligator bog, dump the body.

1620
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:32,985
We're gonna return the Smart car,

1621
01:08:33,068 --> 01:08:36,030
wake up the G-string guy,
tell him he hit his head really hard.

1622
01:08:36,113 --> 01:08:37,993
- Blair's gonna give him a ton of cash.
- Wait, what?

1623
01:08:38,073 --> 01:08:40,117
- And then we're home free.
- I love it. Yeah.

1624
01:08:48,501 --> 01:08:50,002
Alligator bog.

1625
01:08:50,085 --> 01:08:53,339
You will arrive
at your destination in 45 minutes.

1626
01:08:53,923 --> 01:08:55,382
I'm a hustler, baby

1627
01:08:55,466 --> 01:08:56,675
Yeah.

1628
01:08:56,842 --> 01:08:59,094
That's what my daddy's made me

1629
01:08:59,512 --> 01:09:01,472
Can I do your...
Do you mind if I do your thing?

1630
01:09:04,683 --> 01:09:06,060
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

1631
01:09:06,143 --> 01:09:07,186
Don't litter.

1632
01:09:08,646 --> 01:09:10,773
Yeah, I'm a hustler, baby

1633
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:14,568
That's what my daddy's made me

1634
01:09:29,875 --> 01:09:31,335
All right.

1635
01:09:31,585 --> 01:09:33,921
Hey, thanks a lot, man.

1636
01:09:34,672 --> 01:09:36,173
- For you.
- Thank you so much.

1637
01:09:36,257 --> 01:09:38,092
So, I got meth.

1638
01:09:38,634 --> 01:09:40,427
You looking? 40 bucks.

1639
01:09:40,636 --> 01:09:43,639
No, thank you so much.
I just need gas money.

1640
01:09:44,473 --> 01:09:47,268
Hey, listen, do you want
to suck my dick for 15 bucks?

1641
01:09:48,352 --> 01:09:50,187
- No. Thank you.
- Okay.

1642
01:09:50,521 --> 01:09:51,772
Good luck, man.

1643
01:09:51,981 --> 01:09:53,190
Thanks, man.

1644
01:09:59,488 --> 01:10:01,448
You will arrive in 25 minutes.

1645
01:10:01,532 --> 01:10:03,172
This is so uncomfortable.

1646
01:10:03,409 --> 01:10:05,327
I mean, does this thing go any faster?

1647
01:10:08,455 --> 01:10:10,708
- Wait!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1648
01:10:19,174 --> 01:10:20,843
So it does go faster?

1649
01:10:21,343 --> 01:10:22,344
Mmm-hmm.

1650
01:10:30,978 --> 01:10:33,192
- Hi, sir. May I...
- Whoa! Get the fuck away from my car.

1651
01:10:33,272 --> 01:10:34,815
- Okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- God.

1652
01:10:35,441 --> 01:10:36,984
Let me suck your dick real fast.

1653
01:10:37,151 --> 01:10:38,235
What?

1654
01:10:38,777 --> 01:10:41,113
- Please?
- No. What is with this place?

1655
01:10:41,614 --> 01:10:43,073
Okay, listen...

1656
01:10:43,574 --> 01:10:44,742
Do you have any meth?

1657
01:10:46,327 --> 01:10:47,661
I'm a hustler, baby

1658
01:10:49,872 --> 01:10:52,374
- I could sell you meth, yeah. Um...
- Really?

1659
01:10:53,792 --> 01:10:56,086
- 80 bucks.
- 80, uh, dollars...

1660
01:10:56,629 --> 01:10:58,047
There you go.

1661
01:11:03,177 --> 01:11:04,849
Do-do-do-do

1662
01:11:04,929 --> 01:11:06,263
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

1663
01:11:07,139 --> 01:11:09,683
- Um, I want to buy some meth.
- Oh!

1664
01:11:10,893 --> 01:11:12,686
Only thing is, though,

1665
01:11:12,978 --> 01:11:15,981
you got to do a little bump, though,
so I know that you're not a cop.

1666
01:11:16,065 --> 01:11:18,275
No, man. Please. I'm not a cop.

1667
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:20,110
You want the meth or not?

1668
01:11:21,528 --> 01:11:22,529
Okay.

1669
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:26,367
Yay! Here we go.

1670
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:28,911
- And one for Papa Bear.
- It burns. All right.

1671
01:11:29,078 --> 01:11:30,371
Forty bucks. Not a cop. Come on.

1672
01:11:32,498 --> 01:11:34,708
- Yes. Great. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1673
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:37,544
So, uh, still a no-go on the BJ, or...

1674
01:11:38,003 --> 01:11:39,380
No, I'm good. Thanks.

1675
01:11:39,713 --> 01:11:41,298
That's fine.

1676
01:11:42,466 --> 01:11:43,842
Actually,

1677
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:46,345
there's somebody I want
to introduce you to.

1678
01:11:47,054 --> 01:11:48,889
- Right on!
- Very nice to meet you.

1679
01:11:48,973 --> 01:11:50,561
- Good to meet you, too.
- This is so perfect.

1680
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:53,018
- Yeah, go. Please, go.
- Okay. Okay.

1681
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:56,522
You got to do it, man. That's true love.

1682
01:12:13,539 --> 01:12:15,082
Guys, I fell asleep.

1683
01:12:15,165 --> 01:12:16,667
I fell asleep.

1684
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:20,129
I had this nightmare
where we had all killed a guy.

1685
01:12:21,088 --> 01:12:22,426
- That is a reality.
- No, we killed somebody.

1686
01:12:22,506 --> 01:12:24,717
What? No!

1687
01:12:24,967 --> 01:12:28,804
Oh, my God! Jet lag is insane, you guys.

1688
01:12:29,013 --> 01:12:30,472
It's no joke!

1689
01:12:30,973 --> 01:12:32,224
No joke!

1690
01:12:32,641 --> 01:12:33,892
Damn it!

1691
01:12:34,643 --> 01:12:37,813
Did you happen to come up with
a be-genius idea out there?

1692
01:12:38,063 --> 01:12:39,314
Yeah, I did, actually.

1693
01:12:39,398 --> 01:12:43,569
In my dream, I remembered
that there was this guy in Australia

1694
01:12:43,652 --> 01:12:45,529
who cooked his girlfriend and ate her.

1695
01:12:45,696 --> 01:12:48,157
- Kiwi.
- I can't 'cause I am vegan.

1696
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:49,324
- But...
- Kiwi.

1697
01:12:49,408 --> 01:12:51,076
Oh, God, I'm so tired.

1698
01:12:51,952 --> 01:12:53,746
We should turn ourselves in. We're guilty.

1699
01:12:53,829 --> 01:12:56,457
No, we are innocent, because
this was an accident, you guys.

1700
01:12:56,665 --> 01:12:57,708
Stop saying that.

1701
01:12:57,791 --> 01:13:01,128
Maybe if you hadn't been lethally horny,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

1702
01:13:01,295 --> 01:13:03,922
I was coked up
because you bought us drugs.

1703
01:13:04,131 --> 01:13:06,300
I didn't force you to do the drugs, Alice.

1704
01:13:06,383 --> 01:13:08,097
And you know what,
nobody's talking about how it was

1705
01:13:08,177 --> 01:13:10,015
Blair's idea to get a stripper
in the first place.

1706
01:13:10,095 --> 01:13:12,014
Yeah, but you're never to blame, right?

1707
01:13:12,097 --> 01:13:14,516
"Look at me, I'm Frankie.
I live in a storage unit.

1708
01:13:14,641 --> 01:13:15,854
- "I'm saving the world."
- You know what?

1709
01:13:15,934 --> 01:13:19,396
You act like everybody's so stupid
for not being a merciless asshole like you.

1710
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,774
- I'm the asshole?
- I mean, you're both kind of assholes.

1711
01:13:21,857 --> 01:13:23,358
- Stay out of this.
- Seriously.

1712
01:13:23,901 --> 01:13:25,611
Maybe you're the asshole, Alice.

1713
01:13:25,778 --> 01:13:26,779
Oh, shit.

1714
01:13:27,112 --> 01:13:28,363
Excuse me, bitch?

1715
01:13:29,782 --> 01:13:31,325
I'm a fucking sweetheart.

1716
01:13:32,284 --> 01:13:35,788
Well, then why do you
insist on calling me Kiwi

1717
01:13:35,871 --> 01:13:38,040
even though I told you
it was culturally insensitive?

1718
01:13:38,373 --> 01:13:42,336
And why did you feel the need
to reach over and try to undo my seat belt

1719
01:13:42,419 --> 01:13:43,962
in the taxicab on the way here?

1720
01:13:44,254 --> 01:13:45,881
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah.

1721
01:13:46,131 --> 01:13:47,883
That's an American bit.

1722
01:13:48,175 --> 01:13:51,011
We do it as a joke. Okay?
We all do it. Right?

1723
01:13:51,386 --> 01:13:52,433
Come on, say it.

1724
01:13:52,513 --> 01:13:55,849
- Alice!
- Oh, my God, stop it, please.

1725
01:13:56,016 --> 01:13:57,893
It's bad enough without
you two going at it.

1726
01:13:57,976 --> 01:14:00,312
And I thought your bridal shower
was a nightmare.

1727
01:14:00,646 --> 01:14:03,006
What are you talking about?
She didn't have a bridal shower.

1728
01:14:03,148 --> 01:14:04,483
No, she didn't.

1729
01:14:08,779 --> 01:14:10,280
You had a bridal shower?

1730
01:14:11,031 --> 01:14:13,742
Well, not really. I mean...

1731
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:17,204
It was, like, work friends.
It wasn't a big deal.

1732
01:14:17,371 --> 01:14:18,413
But Blair went?

1733
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:20,249
It wasn't even open bar.

1734
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:22,167
What? It wasn't.

1735
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:24,711
How could you not invite me?

1736
01:14:25,129 --> 01:14:27,172
Alice, please. Please, can we drop it?

1737
01:14:27,798 --> 01:14:30,843
Please. I'm telling you, it was just...
It was for Peter's family.

1738
01:14:30,926 --> 01:14:32,761
- It wasn't a big deal, man.
- Oh, Peter.

1739
01:14:33,387 --> 01:14:35,055
He is so annoying.

1740
01:14:35,514 --> 01:14:36,874
And I know why he doesn't like me.

1741
01:14:38,016 --> 01:14:39,935
'Cause he's, like, so freaking jealous.

1742
01:14:41,019 --> 01:14:42,271
Peter is not jealous of you.

1743
01:14:42,354 --> 01:14:45,774
Well, then, why would you not invite
your best friend to your bridal shower?

1744
01:14:45,858 --> 01:14:48,527
- Oh, my God, you really want to know why?
- Yes! I do!

1745
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:50,571
Because I knew that if I invited you,

1746
01:14:50,654 --> 01:14:52,781
you wouldn't let me talk to anybody else.
That's why.

1747
01:14:53,115 --> 01:14:55,242
Okay? You monopolize my time

1748
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:56,994
and then you make me feel guilty

1749
01:14:57,119 --> 01:14:59,746
about not spending time with you.
How can I win?

1750
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:00,914
Are you kidding me?

1751
01:15:01,248 --> 01:15:03,500
I do not monopolize your time, Jess!

1752
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:04,838
I just try to make the most of it,

1753
01:15:04,918 --> 01:15:06,840
'cause you don't even make
an effort to see me anymore.

1754
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,006
- That's not true!
- It is true.

1755
01:15:09,464 --> 01:15:10,632
It is.

1756
01:15:11,216 --> 01:15:13,093
I'm sorry, but you are always at work,

1757
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:15,345
or you're making plans with Peter.

1758
01:15:16,013 --> 01:15:18,390
Or you're
Skyping with other people.

1759
01:15:18,473 --> 01:15:20,267
I can't do your stupid fucking accent.

1760
01:15:20,684 --> 01:15:22,728
- No, you can't.
- Yes, yes.

1761
01:15:22,811 --> 01:15:26,148
We're not in college anymore,
and things do change.

1762
01:15:26,356 --> 01:15:28,525
The only thing that's changed is you.

1763
01:15:28,775 --> 01:15:30,319
You've become obsessed

1764
01:15:30,736 --> 01:15:34,448
with your perfect new life
and your campaign and you ditched me.

1765
01:15:34,573 --> 01:15:38,243
Oh, I am sorry that I
don't want to talk about

1766
01:15:38,327 --> 01:15:40,287
the time that we got drunk

1767
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:42,748
at O'Flaherty's 10 years ago!

1768
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:44,291
Well, you know what?

1769
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:47,294
I guess I never should have planned
such a nice weekend for you.

1770
01:15:47,377 --> 01:15:50,088
You know, you... God,
you are so ungrateful.

1771
01:15:50,714 --> 01:15:52,799
- Did you just say I was ungrateful?
- Yes!

1772
01:15:52,883 --> 01:15:54,635
You're an ungrateful person.

1773
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:57,471
You didn't plan this weekend for me.

1774
01:15:57,554 --> 01:16:00,015
You planned this weekend for yourself,

1775
01:16:00,182 --> 01:16:02,517
so that you could post a bunch of photos

1776
01:16:02,601 --> 01:16:05,479
and not make your life seem so sad!

1777
01:16:11,276 --> 01:16:12,694
I'm sorry, Jess.

1778
01:16:15,322 --> 01:16:16,323
Uh...

1779
01:16:17,741 --> 01:16:19,076
I'll leave you...

1780
01:16:19,243 --> 01:16:20,994
I'll leave you alone from now on.

1781
01:16:22,204 --> 01:16:23,372
Alice.

1782
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:26,708
Alice.

1783
01:16:31,213 --> 01:16:32,881
Jess, that was really harsh.

1784
01:16:33,173 --> 01:16:35,467
Oh, my God, I can't.
I can't with the guilt. Please.

1785
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:38,470
I can't with any of this anymore.

1786
01:16:39,263 --> 01:16:40,514
Jess, come on, dude.

1787
01:16:40,722 --> 01:16:45,519
No. All we have done all night
is make this situation worse, okay?

1788
01:16:45,602 --> 01:16:48,480
We are turning ourselves in
and that's the end.

1789
01:16:48,605 --> 01:16:50,857
Now, I'm going upstairs
to wipe this shit off my face,

1790
01:16:50,941 --> 01:16:53,026
so I can at least look
cute for my mug shot.

1791
01:16:55,404 --> 01:16:58,615
And self-waxing is not weird.

1792
01:16:59,366 --> 01:17:02,744
I don't appreciate
your body-hair-removal shaming.

1793
01:17:04,496 --> 01:17:06,331
Shame on you! And you!

1794
01:17:08,542 --> 01:17:09,584
You've been fine.

1795
01:17:19,303 --> 01:17:21,054
Did you hear that? What is that?

1796
01:17:22,389 --> 01:17:24,224
- What is that?
- Where is it?

1797
01:17:25,142 --> 01:17:26,184
Where's it coming from?

1798
01:17:30,147 --> 01:17:32,607
- Not these pillows.
- Aw, fuck. No.

1799
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,520
Fuck, it's his phone.

1800
01:17:36,653 --> 01:17:38,450
- Someone is looking for this guy.
- Oh, my God.

1801
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:39,865
- Turn it off.
- I'm trying!

1802
01:17:40,324 --> 01:17:42,084
- What's going on?
- Stop! Oh, my God.

1803
01:17:42,367 --> 01:17:45,367
Someone is trying to track the stripper's
phone and it looks like they're...

1804
01:17:48,081 --> 01:17:49,416
Here.

1805
01:17:55,714 --> 01:17:57,632
- Hello?
- Miami PD.

1806
01:17:58,216 --> 01:17:59,676
Have you seen this man?

1807
01:18:00,802 --> 01:18:01,928
Oh, shit.

1808
01:18:03,513 --> 01:18:04,851
We tracked his phone to this house.

1809
01:18:04,931 --> 01:18:06,183
We know he's in there.

1810
01:18:08,977 --> 01:18:10,103
It's over.

1811
01:18:10,771 --> 01:18:12,064
The jig is up.

1812
01:18:17,319 --> 01:18:18,612
Hey.

1813
01:18:19,821 --> 01:18:21,156
He's dead.

1814
01:18:29,164 --> 01:18:30,665
And I don't want ya

1815
01:18:30,749 --> 01:18:32,269
And I don't need ya

1816
01:18:36,755 --> 01:18:39,966
Hey, you, what do ya see?

1817
01:18:40,217 --> 01:18:41,760
Something beautiful

1818
01:18:41,843 --> 01:18:43,762
Or something free?

1819
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:53,355
You ladies are lucky.

1820
01:18:54,439 --> 01:18:55,816
This man is very dangerous.

1821
01:18:56,066 --> 01:18:58,426
This guy robbed a jewelry store
and killed a security guard.

1822
01:18:58,652 --> 01:19:00,824
- Lot of people looking for him.
- Oh, my God. What?

1823
01:19:00,904 --> 01:19:02,364
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. He was on the run.

1824
01:19:02,697 --> 01:19:03,994
Probably came here looking for cover.

1825
01:19:04,074 --> 01:19:06,076
Sir, I'm... I'm sorry.

1826
01:19:06,284 --> 01:19:09,329
Um, foreigner here. Just sort of
want to be clear on the local law.

1827
01:19:09,413 --> 01:19:10,831
So, are we

1828
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:13,834
sort of, like, no longer in trouble?

1829
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:16,837
Sounds like self-defense to me, right?

1830
01:19:17,295 --> 01:19:18,383
Oh, yeah,
no, DA's not gonna want to

1831
01:19:18,463 --> 01:19:20,583
press any charges on something like this.
You're good.

1832
01:19:21,299 --> 01:19:22,759
- Oh, my God.
- No, you're kidding.

1833
01:19:22,843 --> 01:19:25,387
- Oh, my God!
- Are you shitting me?

1834
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:27,264
Oh, my God!

1835
01:19:27,973 --> 01:19:29,891
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

1836
01:19:31,476 --> 01:19:36,064
We're heroes! We're heroes.
We're American heroes.

1837
01:19:36,148 --> 01:19:38,024
- Thank you, universe.
- Jesus!

1838
01:19:41,445 --> 01:19:44,197
We killed a guy! And it was right!

1839
01:19:44,656 --> 01:19:46,700
We were right to kill him!

1840
01:19:46,867 --> 01:19:49,035
Fuck, yeah!

1841
01:19:52,372 --> 01:19:53,498
Jess.

1842
01:19:53,748 --> 01:19:55,876
Hey, Jess. We're not going to jail.

1843
01:19:56,209 --> 01:19:59,880
I still might be, for unrelated things,
but you're not, you're safe.

1844
01:20:00,797 --> 01:20:02,048
Jess?

1845
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,720
You should've seen us at the beginning.
We were like Squabble City.

1846
01:20:06,803 --> 01:20:07,888
We didn't like each other.

1847
01:20:07,971 --> 01:20:10,682
Now I can't get her away from me.
And I don't want to.

1848
01:20:10,765 --> 01:20:12,684
Did he happen to mention the diamonds?

1849
01:20:12,976 --> 01:20:14,978
Um, no, I think I would have
remembered that.

1850
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:16,480
He didn't say much of anything.

1851
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:21,526
Ladies, it's... It's really important
that you try to remember any details.

1852
01:20:21,693 --> 01:20:23,278
He was cis male.

1853
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:28,450
Looked like he could, like,
wash his car as a hobby activity.

1854
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,494
- Okay.
- Oh, and he did have

1855
01:20:30,577 --> 01:20:31,828
this, like, deep "V."

1856
01:20:31,995 --> 01:20:36,166
Sort of like two large snakes
pointing down to a penis.

1857
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:38,043
This is a big house.

1858
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:40,132
Any place he might've been
able to stash something?

1859
01:20:40,212 --> 01:20:44,466
Well, we did clean the entire house
and never came across his coat or phone,

1860
01:20:44,549 --> 01:20:45,846
so it's definitely a possibility.

1861
01:20:45,926 --> 01:20:47,093
Tampon!

1862
01:20:47,302 --> 01:20:48,720
- What?
- Blair.

1863
01:20:48,929 --> 01:20:51,556
- What?
- I need a tampon.

1864
01:20:51,973 --> 01:20:53,808
I thought you use David cups.

1865
01:20:53,975 --> 01:20:55,477
- Yeah.
- No, never.

1866
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:59,314
Fuck off. Only tampons,
the best of tampons!

1867
01:20:59,523 --> 01:21:01,358
You took them from us.

1868
01:21:01,691 --> 01:21:04,110
- What?
- And locked them in there,

1869
01:21:04,236 --> 01:21:06,863
- and you have the key.
- What are you talking about?

1870
01:21:06,947 --> 01:21:09,199
I didn't lock away our tampons.
I locked away our...

1871
01:21:09,824 --> 01:21:11,743
Uh...

1872
01:21:12,244 --> 01:21:14,955
Are we on the same page, Blair?

1873
01:21:15,497 --> 01:21:16,915
- Yes.
- Yo, yo.

1874
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,200
Lady, you want to get your
friend a tampon or whatever?

1875
01:21:19,834 --> 01:21:23,338
Okay. One tampon coming up.

1876
01:21:23,421 --> 01:21:24,506
Okay...

1877
01:21:24,589 --> 01:21:26,189
Just be right back with that.

1878
01:21:26,383 --> 01:21:28,176
Well, I'm not on my period.

1879
01:21:28,718 --> 01:21:30,220
It's good to know. Thanks.

1880
01:21:34,057 --> 01:21:35,559
Key.

1881
01:21:36,351 --> 01:21:39,020
Shit. Shit.

1882
01:21:40,438 --> 01:21:41,648
Shh...

1883
01:21:45,026 --> 01:21:46,194
Quiet, be quiet, be quiet.

1884
01:21:46,278 --> 01:21:47,741
I just need to get my phone, okay?

1885
01:21:47,821 --> 01:21:48,992
- What the fuck is that?
- What's that?

1886
01:21:49,072 --> 01:21:50,272
Nothing. It's... I don't know.

1887
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:53,285
- What the fuck was that?
- This guy, it's another thing.

1888
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:55,081
- There's more people here?
- The real stripper.

1889
01:21:55,161 --> 01:21:57,601
- Yeah. That's the real stripper in there.
- The actual guy...

1890
01:21:58,039 --> 01:22:00,199
- I just need to get to my phone.
- Get back! Get back!

1891
01:22:00,542 --> 01:22:03,503
- I will not be your drug mule!
- What? Shh! Stop. Stop. Stop.

1892
01:22:03,753 --> 01:22:05,353
- You better get back. Yeah.
- Stop. Shh!

1893
01:22:06,339 --> 01:22:09,217
Breaking news and
some updated information for everybody.

1894
01:22:09,301 --> 01:22:11,553
These assailants are armed
and they're dangerous.

1895
01:22:11,636 --> 01:22:12,641
No, it's nothing, that's...

1896
01:22:12,721 --> 01:22:13,767
So if you're inside your home,

1897
01:22:13,847 --> 01:22:15,767
make sure your windows
and your doors are locked.

1898
01:22:16,266 --> 01:22:18,935
- Hey, Blondie! Come here!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1899
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:20,687
Shh.

1900
01:22:21,521 --> 01:22:23,565
- Oh, the tampon.
- Yeah, I know.

1901
01:22:23,648 --> 01:22:25,358
That's what I was... I was using the code.

1902
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:27,810
- I just want to get my real estate license!
- Shut up.

1903
01:22:27,986 --> 01:22:29,237
Freeze!

1904
01:22:29,571 --> 01:22:31,489
Shut the fuck up! Don't move!

1905
01:22:31,948 --> 01:22:35,068
What the hell's going on here? Come on.
Let's go, move it. Let's go, tough guy.

1906
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:39,831
Everyone in America really does have a gun!

1907
01:22:40,498 --> 01:22:42,542
Let's go! Come on.
You, too. Move it.

1908
01:22:43,835 --> 01:22:45,629
- Oh, my God.
- Playtime's over.

1909
01:22:45,712 --> 01:22:47,832
- We want those fucking diamonds now.
- Look.

1910
01:22:48,381 --> 01:22:49,591
I know you're mad at the 1%.

1911
01:22:49,716 --> 01:22:52,135
- I am, too.
- What? Shut up!

1912
01:22:52,218 --> 01:22:54,054
- Tie them up now.
- Let's go!

1913
01:23:16,868 --> 01:23:17,952
Jess,

1914
01:23:18,036 --> 01:23:21,164
when I was growing up,
I didn't really have many friends.

1915
01:23:21,456 --> 01:23:24,292
And when I left for college,
my mom was worried about me.

1916
01:23:24,459 --> 01:23:25,877
And so was I.

1917
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,380
But then we met,
and the first night we went out,

1918
01:23:28,463 --> 01:23:30,343
you didn't introduce me
to people as your roommate,

1919
01:23:30,423 --> 01:23:32,217
you introduced me as your friend.

1920
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:34,427
And I knew everything was gonna be okay.

1921
01:23:34,803 --> 01:23:36,221
When I went home that summer

1922
01:23:36,346 --> 01:23:38,473
and I showed my mom
the photos of us hanging out,

1923
01:23:38,807 --> 01:23:40,433
she was so happy.

1924
01:23:40,975 --> 01:23:44,562
She doesn't always recognize me anymore,
but when I show her those old photos,

1925
01:23:44,646 --> 01:23:47,899
she says to me,
"That's my daughter with all her friends."

1926
01:23:48,566 --> 01:23:50,193
That's how she remembers me.

1927
01:23:50,694 --> 01:23:51,986
Thanks to you.

1928
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:54,781
I can't wait to show her
all the photos from this weekend.

1929
01:23:55,281 --> 01:23:58,618
You were there for me,
and I will always be here for you.

1930
01:23:59,035 --> 01:24:00,453
Love, Alice.

1931
01:24:00,662 --> 01:24:04,666
P. S. There are some wet wipes in here,
because I ordered an ice cream cake

1932
01:24:04,749 --> 01:24:07,043
and I know you have issues with dairy.

1933
01:24:07,127 --> 01:24:08,670
Smiliest face.

1934
01:24:15,009 --> 01:24:18,179
- Come here. Let's go. Come here.
- They found me on Craigslist.

1935
01:24:18,263 --> 01:24:20,181
I'm not even with them!

1936
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:21,975
God damn it.

1937
01:24:23,268 --> 01:24:24,394
Oh, shit.

1938
01:24:25,186 --> 01:24:26,479
Jay double-crossed us,

1939
01:24:26,938 --> 01:24:28,606
and he took off with our score.

1940
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:30,442
So, tell me,

1941
01:24:30,817 --> 01:24:33,111
- where'd he put it?
- I told you, we don't know.

1942
01:24:33,361 --> 01:24:37,282
Sir, I could wire you $50,000 right now
if you just let us go, okay?

1943
01:24:37,365 --> 01:24:39,743
Whoa, whoa, whoa. 50, 000 what?

1944
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:42,248
There's over $2 million
worth of diamonds in this house,

1945
01:24:42,328 --> 01:24:43,747
and I am going to find them.

1946
01:24:44,998 --> 01:24:46,916
You shoot anyone who moves.

1947
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:48,668
- Oh, my God.
- Please.

1948
01:25:25,413 --> 01:25:26,623
Fuck!

1949
01:25:26,748 --> 01:25:28,416
Damn it! Fuck!

1950
01:25:30,627 --> 01:25:32,670
Don't make a fucking sound
or I will kill you.

1951
01:25:41,971 --> 01:25:43,014
What?

1952
01:25:43,348 --> 01:25:45,016
Handcuff yourself to the sink.

1953
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:47,143
- Fuck you.
- Now.

1954
01:25:48,728 --> 01:25:50,104
Okay. Okay.

1955
01:26:04,786 --> 01:26:06,079
What the fuck?

1956
01:26:17,215 --> 01:26:19,384
No...

1957
01:26:25,974 --> 01:26:28,646
You don't know anything, huh?
Well, that smells like bullshit.

1958
01:26:28,726 --> 01:26:30,228
Hurry up, man!

1959
01:26:30,937 --> 01:26:32,438
Do I look stupid to you?

1960
01:26:32,897 --> 01:26:36,359
You expect me to believe
that you killed Jay by accident?

1961
01:26:37,235 --> 01:26:39,028
That's a bad accident.

1962
01:26:39,612 --> 01:26:41,406
It's a big fucking accident.

1963
01:26:45,368 --> 01:26:47,287
I am about to lose my fucking shit.

1964
01:26:47,370 --> 01:26:48,708
Jay's dead, and you expect me
to believe

1965
01:26:48,788 --> 01:26:50,540
that you guys don't know anything? Hmm?

1966
01:26:50,665 --> 01:26:53,084
New plan.
You're gonna watch each other die,

1967
01:26:53,167 --> 01:26:54,847
until one of you opens your fucking mouth!

1968
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:57,505
- And I'm gonna start with you.
- No!

1969
01:26:57,839 --> 01:26:59,716
- Oh, God.
- I love you, Frankie.

1970
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:01,718
I love you, too.

1971
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:08,808
Jess! Jess!

1972
01:27:08,975 --> 01:27:10,977
Yes!

1973
01:27:15,648 --> 01:27:17,288
- Not her beautiful face!
- Come on, Jess!

1974
01:27:21,487 --> 01:27:22,530
Whoa.

1975
01:27:22,614 --> 01:27:23,948
- You perv!
- Come on.

1976
01:27:24,949 --> 01:27:25,912
No, hey, hey, hey!

1977
01:27:25,992 --> 01:27:27,112
Ow! Ow!

1978
01:27:27,285 --> 01:27:28,703
You guys! The gun!

1979
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:32,290
Shimmy. Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.

1980
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:37,921
Okay. Okay.

1981
01:27:41,507 --> 01:27:42,595
- Right there.
- Okay. Yeah.

1982
01:27:42,675 --> 01:27:43,843
- One.
- Two.

1983
01:27:44,010 --> 01:27:45,219
- Three!
- Okay.

1984
01:27:45,303 --> 01:27:46,846
Oh, God. Squat.

1985
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:49,227
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Do you have it?

1986
01:27:49,307 --> 01:27:51,351
Yes.

1987
01:27:56,606 --> 01:27:57,815
Point me in his direction.

1988
01:28:02,862 --> 01:28:05,198
I don't have a shot!
Your leg is in the way!

1989
01:28:05,698 --> 01:28:07,492
- No, no. Please.
- Up!

1990
01:28:07,575 --> 01:28:08,910
No, please.

1991
01:28:12,163 --> 01:28:13,373
I shot a guy!

1992
01:28:13,748 --> 01:28:16,084
- Yes!
- I killed another person.

1993
01:28:16,751 --> 01:28:18,628
You fucking...

1994
01:28:19,462 --> 01:28:20,505
Yes!

1995
01:28:23,341 --> 01:28:25,301
Oh, my God, you guys!

1996
01:28:26,386 --> 01:28:27,428
That was awesome.

1997
01:28:27,512 --> 01:28:29,263
- Alice, I'm so sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

1998
01:28:29,347 --> 01:28:31,975
No. I said things that I didn't mean.

1999
01:28:32,517 --> 01:28:34,602
I think it was just
the stress of killing somebody

2000
01:28:34,686 --> 01:28:36,521
and then trying to dispose of his body.

2001
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:38,151
- Wait, what?
- Totally.

2002
01:28:38,231 --> 01:28:39,944
- That's a hard thing.
- Yeah, you're right.

2003
01:28:40,024 --> 01:28:41,067
I have changed.

2004
01:28:41,234 --> 01:28:43,194
I thought that I was
making people's lives better,

2005
01:28:43,277 --> 01:28:46,277
but I forgot about the people that
make my life better, and that's you guys.

2006
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:48,620
- And I love you, and I'm sorry.
- We love you, too.

2007
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:49,746
- We love you, too.
- We love you.

2008
01:28:49,826 --> 01:28:51,995
- We love you, Jess!
- I'm sorry, too.

2009
01:28:52,245 --> 01:28:54,205
And you know what? I know that I'm a lot.

2010
01:28:54,288 --> 01:28:57,041
And you were right,
I need to stop living in the past

2011
01:28:57,166 --> 01:28:59,422
- and get a hobby, you know?
- Well, it could help, right?

2012
01:28:59,502 --> 01:29:01,671
Next time we see each other,
we can make new memories

2013
01:29:01,754 --> 01:29:03,923
instead of just talking about the old ones.

2014
01:29:04,007 --> 01:29:05,925
Um, these zip ties are
really starting to hurt.

2015
01:29:06,009 --> 01:29:07,593
And I'm sorry about Peter, okay?

2016
01:29:07,677 --> 01:29:10,304
He does not suck.
You should totally marry him.

2017
01:29:10,388 --> 01:29:12,348
- Well, I will.
- Good. You should.

2018
01:29:12,557 --> 01:29:15,184
I mean, I had a sex dream about him,
and I didn't even tell you.

2019
01:29:15,268 --> 01:29:16,477
No, you actually did tell me.

2020
01:29:16,561 --> 01:29:18,521
- You told everybody.
- You started a group text.

2021
01:29:18,813 --> 01:29:20,234
It started with him brushing my hair...

2022
01:29:20,314 --> 01:29:21,736
You know what?
I'm gonna untie you guys now.

2023
01:29:21,816 --> 01:29:22,904
- Awesome.
- Yeah. Okay, great.

2024
01:29:22,984 --> 01:29:24,572
- Here, give me the gun.
- It was morning...

2025
01:29:24,652 --> 01:29:26,112
Drop the gun!

2026
01:29:26,571 --> 01:29:28,239
- Drop it.
- Damn it.

2027
01:29:30,575 --> 01:29:33,953
The keys were taped to the handcuffs,
you fucking idiot.

2028
01:29:35,455 --> 01:29:36,873
You're all dead. All of you.

2029
01:29:36,956 --> 01:29:38,750
- No. No, Jess.
- Yeah.

2030
01:29:39,125 --> 01:29:41,794
Oh, really? Come on. Whatever.

2031
01:29:44,881 --> 01:29:46,632
What? What? What?

2032
01:29:47,508 --> 01:29:48,634
What?

2033
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:54,849
- Oh, my God!
- Is that Peter?

2034
01:29:59,187 --> 01:30:00,688
Oh, my God. Is he...

2035
01:30:01,981 --> 01:30:03,695
- Peter!
- You guys, what's happening back there?

2036
01:30:03,775 --> 01:30:04,776
I can't see.

2037
01:30:06,319 --> 01:30:08,362
- Peter? Peter.
- Hmm?

2038
01:30:08,446 --> 01:30:09,614
Peter.

2039
01:30:09,781 --> 01:30:11,616
- Jess.
- Are you okay?

2040
01:30:12,575 --> 01:30:14,368
Do you not like my dick?

2041
01:30:15,161 --> 01:30:16,204
What?

2042
01:30:16,329 --> 01:30:18,249
Does it bend weird
when it gets hard, or, like...

2043
01:30:18,456 --> 01:30:20,917
- I don't know, is it...
- What? No, I love it.

2044
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:22,752
So, you still want to get married?

2045
01:30:23,252 --> 01:30:27,423
Yes. More than ever
I want to get married. I love you.

2046
01:30:28,758 --> 01:30:29,884
I want that.

2047
01:30:31,094 --> 01:30:32,345
Peter...

2048
01:30:32,845 --> 01:30:35,598
Let's just get married.
Let's get married this weekend.

2049
01:30:35,681 --> 01:30:37,270
Well, what about the campaign?
Didn't you want to wait

2050
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:38,563
till after the election, and...

2051
01:30:38,643 --> 01:30:41,395
I don't want to wait.
Everyone I love is right here.

2052
01:30:41,771 --> 01:30:43,064
- That's all that matters.
- Oh.

2053
01:30:43,189 --> 01:30:44,273
What about your parents?

2054
01:30:44,357 --> 01:30:46,317
Oh, my parents aren't gonna care.
They eloped.

2055
01:30:46,859 --> 01:30:49,259
I mean, my mom did say
to lock that down as soon as possible.

2056
01:30:49,904 --> 01:30:51,656
- She did?
- She loves you.

2057
01:30:52,406 --> 01:30:54,325
- I love you. Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

2058
01:30:54,826 --> 01:30:56,536
Yes!

2059
01:30:56,619 --> 01:30:58,246
Oh, I have the perfect place.

2060
01:31:01,624 --> 01:31:05,461
Do you, Jessica,
take Peter to be your husband?

2061
01:31:06,129 --> 01:31:07,255
I do.

2062
01:31:07,839 --> 01:31:11,801
And do you, Peter,
take Jessica to be your wife?

2063
01:31:12,260 --> 01:31:13,636
I definitely do.

2064
01:31:16,889 --> 01:31:18,850
Now, by the power vested in me

2065
01:31:19,725 --> 01:31:22,728
by GetOrdainedNow.net,

2066
01:31:23,104 --> 01:31:25,106
I pronounce you husband and wife.

2067
01:31:25,189 --> 01:31:26,858
You may kiss the groom.

2068
01:31:32,488 --> 01:31:35,158
So glad I didn't sell our passes
to the foam party.

2069
01:31:35,241 --> 01:31:36,242
- Yeah!
- Right?

2070
01:31:48,087 --> 01:31:50,006
So, you guys are just not in trouble?

2071
01:31:50,464 --> 01:31:52,550
No, we're, like, completely free.

2072
01:31:53,134 --> 01:31:56,554
We've committed what in Florida
is known as a "good murder."

2073
01:31:56,846 --> 01:31:58,764
That's a direct quote from the Miami PD.

2074
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:04,020
So, not only do we not have to go to jail,
but we got a sick coupon

2075
01:32:04,353 --> 01:32:06,063
to Romano's Macaroni Grill.

2076
01:32:06,522 --> 01:32:09,025
- Do you want to dance, Pippa?
- Yeah, okay.

2077
01:32:09,233 --> 01:32:11,152
But call me Kiwi, okay?

2078
01:32:11,277 --> 01:32:12,778
All my best friends do.

2079
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:17,992
- Hey.
- Hi.

2080
01:32:18,075 --> 01:32:20,870
- Can I get you a drink?
- Oh. Um...

2081
01:32:21,746 --> 01:32:22,788
No.

2082
01:32:23,164 --> 01:32:25,458
'Cause I'm on a date
with someone else, so...

2083
01:32:26,542 --> 01:32:28,211
- Hey.
- Hot.

2084
01:32:28,461 --> 01:32:30,129
You're a hot guy. Cool.

2085
01:32:34,091 --> 01:32:35,176
- Here you go.
- Oh.

2086
01:32:36,636 --> 01:32:38,012
Oh, my God.

2087
01:32:39,013 --> 01:32:41,766
Has anyone ever told you
how beautiful your feet are?

2088
01:32:43,893 --> 01:32:45,645
No one's ever said that to me before.

2089
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:48,439
You should've been told
that a million times.

2090
01:32:49,857 --> 01:32:51,484
Do you want to...

2091
01:32:51,567 --> 01:32:52,735
- Fuck?
- Fuck?

2092
01:32:53,361 --> 01:32:55,196
Hey.

2093
01:32:55,905 --> 01:32:57,105
Keep it moving. We're a thing.

2094
01:32:58,532 --> 01:32:59,867
Love wins.

2095
01:33:00,826 --> 01:33:01,994
What'd you just say?

2096
01:33:02,787 --> 01:33:05,414
I don't know.
I mean, who knows if it will work out?

2097
01:33:05,498 --> 01:33:08,296
And I don't know how you're gonna get to
New York. I guess hitchhike, but...

2098
01:33:08,376 --> 01:33:10,711
I already have my bags
packed, actually, so...

2099
01:33:10,836 --> 01:33:13,798
Well, just 'cause I'm between places...

2100
01:33:14,507 --> 01:33:15,967
Shut up.

2101
01:33:18,844 --> 01:33:20,471
Yeah, yeah.

2102
01:33:21,013 --> 01:33:22,515
Okay. Yeah.

2103
01:33:22,598 --> 01:33:24,016
Babe. It's for you.

2104
01:33:25,184 --> 01:33:27,061
- Hello?
- Jess, it's me.

2105
01:33:27,144 --> 01:33:30,234
That story about you and your friends
taking out those criminals is everywhere!

2106
01:33:30,314 --> 01:33:32,483
Okay?
We're getting donations and volunteers.

2107
01:33:32,566 --> 01:33:35,528
- What?
- Jess, you're gonna win this thing.

2108
01:33:35,611 --> 01:33:37,446
Are you serious? That's amazing.

2109
01:33:37,655 --> 01:33:39,448
Yeah, we're getting a
ton of media requests.

2110
01:33:39,532 --> 01:33:41,534
Okay, Good Morning America, Ellen.

2111
01:33:41,826 --> 01:33:45,162
Okay, you have to get back here right now.
I'm gonna get you out on the next flight.

2112
01:33:45,246 --> 01:33:46,706
Do you prefer window or aisle?

2113
01:33:46,789 --> 01:33:48,708
I'm more of a middle
seat guy myself, but...

2114
01:33:48,791 --> 01:33:50,835
You know what?
I'm actually getting married.

2115
01:33:50,918 --> 01:33:53,421
But, um, I'll be there
first thing Monday morning.

2116
01:33:53,504 --> 01:33:55,881
You're getting married?
Jess, I'm in love with you.

2117
01:33:57,049 --> 01:33:58,387
- Take a picture of us?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2118
01:33:58,467 --> 01:33:59,593
Cool!

2119
01:34:00,761 --> 01:34:02,555
- I love you guys.
- We love you.

2120
01:34:03,222 --> 01:34:04,265
Three.

2121
01:34:06,309 --> 01:34:07,643
Can I see?

2122
01:34:08,144 --> 01:34:09,478
Um...

2123
01:34:09,562 --> 01:34:11,230
- No.
- My arm looks too thick.

2124
01:34:13,316 --> 01:34:14,570
- Another one?
- One more.

2125
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:15,860
Okay, okay, okay.

2126
01:34:20,489 --> 01:34:21,869
- Ooh. I love it.
- That, I love.

2127
01:34:21,949 --> 01:34:24,493
- Alice, you can tag me.
- Finally.

2128
01:34:28,205 --> 01:34:30,082
We are what

2129
01:34:30,166 --> 01:34:32,293
These days we only follow

2130
01:34:32,376 --> 01:34:34,837
These days we're feeling hollow

2131
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,715
Get paid, the only motto

2132
01:34:38,341 --> 01:34:40,134
We are what

2133
01:34:40,217 --> 01:34:42,636
They say it all gets better

2134
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:45,181
They say it won't last forever

2135
01:34:45,264 --> 01:34:47,892
Then someone pulls the trigger

2136
01:34:48,893 --> 01:34:51,145
We are what

2137
01:34:52,229 --> 01:34:54,982
The fame, the fame

2138
01:34:55,066 --> 01:34:57,193
I want to hear my name

2139
01:34:57,276 --> 01:34:59,278
But I don't care

2140
01:34:59,779 --> 01:35:02,198
What for

2141
01:35:02,782 --> 01:35:05,326
I'll change the world

2142
01:35:05,409 --> 01:35:07,870
Save all those trees and birds

2143
01:35:07,953 --> 01:35:10,122
But first I'll grab a Starbucks

2144
01:35:10,206 --> 01:35:11,999
Then I'll get to work

2145
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:13,834
All on

2146
01:35:13,918 --> 01:35:15,544
Thank God it's the weekend

2147
01:35:15,628 --> 01:35:16,670
My squad

2148
01:35:16,754 --> 01:35:17,797
Got time, we can waste it

2149
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:18,923
Don't know

2150
01:35:19,006 --> 01:35:22,468
Should we drive to the sunset or the fire?

2151
01:35:22,551 --> 01:35:23,594
It's like

2152
01:35:23,677 --> 01:35:24,970
We live in the bubble

2153
01:35:25,054 --> 01:35:27,390
Pretending it's 'cause we are young

2154
01:35:27,473 --> 01:35:29,392
We are what

2155
01:35:29,475 --> 01:35:31,644
These days we only follow

2156
01:35:31,727 --> 01:35:34,230
These days we're feeling hollow

2157
01:35:34,313 --> 01:35:36,649
Get paid, the only motto

2158
01:35:37,566 --> 01:35:39,485
We are what

2159
01:35:39,568 --> 01:35:41,862
They say it all gets better

2160
01:35:41,946 --> 01:35:44,532
They say it won't last forever

2161
01:35:44,615 --> 01:35:46,992
Then someone pulls the trigger

2162
01:35:48,285 --> 01:35:51,997
We've got hearts in the right places

2163
01:35:52,081 --> 01:35:55,918
But we're still a danger to ourselves

2164
01:35:56,001 --> 01:35:58,337
Maybe it's 'cause we are young

2165
01:35:58,421 --> 01:36:00,464
We are what

2166
01:36:04,301 --> 01:36:08,264
Congratulations to
State Senator Jess Thayer!

2167
01:36:09,515 --> 01:36:10,558
Thank you.

2168
01:36:10,683 --> 01:36:13,018
My number one boss bitch! Whoo!

2169
01:36:15,729 --> 01:36:19,150
And now to celebrate her win,
we have a special request.

2170
01:36:19,483 --> 01:36:20,526
Me?

2171
01:36:23,696 --> 01:36:25,114
Thank you so much.

2172
01:36:25,489 --> 01:36:28,367
I actually have a surprise
for all of you. Um...

2173
01:36:28,909 --> 01:36:30,619
I've written a song

2174
01:36:30,786 --> 01:36:34,290
that I hope can sort of encapsulate,

2175
01:36:34,582 --> 01:36:37,585
um, the bond of friendship
that we all have.

2176
01:36:38,002 --> 01:36:40,296
And so, I want to play it for you now.

2177
01:36:41,922 --> 01:36:45,134
Sometimes

2178
01:36:46,093 --> 01:36:48,095
You kill a man

2179
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:53,184
When he's taking off his clothes for you

2180
01:36:54,935 --> 01:36:57,354
You kill a man

2181
01:36:58,481 --> 01:37:01,358
You kill him with your friends

2182
01:37:01,525 --> 01:37:03,110
And he dies

2183
01:37:04,528 --> 01:37:06,906
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

2184
01:37:07,448 --> 01:37:08,574
Jesus, it's good.

2185
01:37:08,657 --> 01:37:10,868
Other times

2186
01:37:12,244 --> 01:37:14,830
When you kill a man

2187
01:37:15,164 --> 01:37:20,503
You need to toss his body in the ocean

2188
01:37:21,003 --> 01:37:23,255
And you don't care

2189
01:37:24,507 --> 01:37:28,969
'Cause your friends are there by your side

2190
01:37:30,554 --> 01:37:32,139
They make it fun

2191
01:37:33,641 --> 01:37:36,644
I love you, girls

2192
01:37:36,977 --> 01:37:38,062
I love you, Pippa!

2193
01:37:38,145 --> 01:37:40,147
We killed a man

2194
01:37:40,314 --> 01:37:42,942
We made a plan

2195
01:37:43,025 --> 01:37:45,819
You are my friends

2196
01:37:46,529 --> 01:37:49,073
And I'll never forget

2197
01:37:49,698 --> 01:37:52,284
This bachelorette

2198
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:56,247
This bachelorette

2199
01:37:59,792 --> 01:38:00,960
That's the end.

2200
01:39:14,825 --> 01:39:16,952
- Do you guys want to come up?
- Um...

2201
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:18,954
No, no, no. Don't come up. Don't come up.

2202
01:39:19,038 --> 01:39:21,707
- 'Cause I got to do stuff.
- What?

2203
01:39:21,874 --> 01:39:24,627
So, I will see you at Nussbaum's at 10:00.

2204
01:39:24,752 --> 01:39:26,253
No, no. 12:30.

2205
01:39:26,587 --> 01:39:28,297
- Okay.
- I don't want to get up.

2206
01:39:29,131 --> 01:39:30,633
Okay, you guys, go. Go, go, go.

2207
01:39:30,883 --> 01:39:32,801
We want to make sure that you get in okay.

2208
01:39:32,885 --> 01:39:35,346
- You're obsessed with me.
- We love you.

2209
01:39:35,471 --> 01:39:36,847
I love you.

2210
01:39:46,565 --> 01:39:47,816
Bullshit.

2211
01:39:53,322 --> 01:39:54,490
Yes!

2212
01:39:55,574 --> 01:39:57,242
Whoo! Ah...
