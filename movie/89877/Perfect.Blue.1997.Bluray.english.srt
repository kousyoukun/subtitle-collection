1
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,140
Powertron!

2
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,640
Special Attack!

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,550
Curses! I'll get you next time, Powertron!

4
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,390
Hold it, Kingburg!

5
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,620
Dammit! Did he get away?

6
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,530
However, we Powertrons will
uphold the peace of the network!

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,690
Yeah!

8
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,210
That was nothing like the stuff on TV.

9
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,210
That was so cheap!

10
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,650
Man, that's like way too expensive.

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,120
Like I said, it's from
that show in Hiroshima.

12
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,560
The one I couldn't go to?

13
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,930
When Rei went fumbling her song
'coz those guys started trouble...

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,260
And this is the MiniDisc from
when Mima sang in Rei's place.

15
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,430
It's a precious sample
of Mima-rin's singing voice!

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,230
Oh, yeah... Is that rumor true?

17
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,700
Oh, that?

18
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,490
Three left, only three left...

19
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,500
Last issue of CHAMMINGBIRD...
only three left.

20
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,410
400 yen... 400 yen...

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,820
Yeah, I read about that too.

22
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,720
I heard she's announcing it today
coz it's the last concert here.

23
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,560
At a nothing show like this?
That's pretty cold of Mima-rin!

24
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,650
There's been lots of solo
activity going on lately...

25
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,700
And only Mima-rin's like
worthy of being an actress?

26
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,600
Look, they're back.

27
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,200
The guys that caused trouble last week.

28
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,570
I just hope they don't make
a mess today, of all days.

29
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,940
I'm getting nervous!

30
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,810
Come on, sit still!

31
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,370
Hey, what's up with this!?
This is all frayed!

32
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,510
Don't look at me!

33
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,150
Get me some masking tape!

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,380
Hello? Yes.

35
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,050
Remember your entrance
in the second song, Mima!

36
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,790
Don't pressure me!

37
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,020
I need a drink!

38
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,890
- You can have drinks after the event.
- I'm sorry. I'll call you back.

39
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,550
You're on!

40
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,500
And it looks like they're set.

41
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,840
Without further adieu,
please welcome to our stage... CHAM!!

42
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:06,479
Got a question about your love?

43
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,309
Send a cry for help and wait a bit.

44
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,220
Love makes your heart race.

45
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,609
If it means you're loved in the end...

46
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,530
...be much more aggressive...

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,199
...because you will get a chance.

48
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:34,200
The angel of love smiles at you.

49
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,300
Mima! Mima! Mima!

50
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,880
Mima should be acting, not singing!

51
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,120
I can't do this after all!

52
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,920
Mika...

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,760
They want her in a drama series.

54
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,700
There are no better deals than this!

55
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,530
She can act AND sing!
That should be all right!

56
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,870
Her schedule with the other two
is already starting to mismatch!

57
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,710
She didn't go through those
hard lessons to become an actress!

58
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,300
The TV producer praised Mima's acting!

59
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,780
But what about MIMA'S feelings!?

60
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,940
...and wait a bit.

61
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,790
Love makes your heart race.

62
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,990
If it means you're loved in the end...

63
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,259
...be much more aggressive...

64
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,790
...because you will get a chance.

65
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:12,730
The angel of love smiles at you.

66
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,450
Thank you very much.

67
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,580
It was a fun concert,
but we only have one song left...

68
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,990
We just got here!

69
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,000
Umm... Before our last song,
we have news to tell you...

70
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,370
Um, I, Kirigoe Mima,
had a fun time as a member of CHAM...

71
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,910
Out of the way!

72
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,910
What did we do!? HUH!?

73
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,420
Quit showin' off! You're only a part-timer!

74
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,650
Outta my face, ya asshole!

75
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,090
YOU get out of here!

76
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,220
What the hell!? Who are
you telling to leave, you fucker!?

77
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,130
It wasn't me!

78
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,000
What are you doing!? Get the hell
over here, whoever threw that!

79
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,970
Go home! Go home!

80
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,460
- Go home! Go home! Go home! Go home!
- Dammit!

81
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,840
Them again!

82
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,140
We're canceling the show!

83
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,460
But today is!

84
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,380
Shut up! Goddammit!

85
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:32,470
Go home! Go home! Go home! Go home!

86
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,950
Stop it!

87
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,360
Today...

88
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,490
Just today... I wanted to have
a good time with all of you!

89
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,740
What attitude from some no-namer!

90
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,700
You little!?

91
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,780
What do you want, you freak?

92
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,210
Let's go!

93
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:21,940
A-Actually... as of today, I...

94
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,779
As of today,
Mima-chan will graduate from CHAM!

95
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,310
What!? Why?

96
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,850
Thank you all.

97
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,750
I'm really happy that I spent the last
2 1/2 years with you all as part of CHAM!

98
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:46,750
I hope you'll support me
as I do my best as a rookie actress.

99
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,400
So this will be my last song.
Please listen.

100
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,070
Well, it totally makes sense
from the agency's point of view.

101
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,480
Pop idols just don't
make money... right?

102
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,280
Metamorphosis, huh?

103
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,650
I still remember well...

104
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,890
...that warmth you'd given me.

105
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:27,430
It was in the gentle rays of sunlight.

106
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,670
I had believed that...

107
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,840
...the days past when...

108
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:43,910
...we were in love, were everything.

109
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,279
Now, embraced by the memories...

110
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,450
...I have become a coward.

111
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:56,690
I am choosing to live a life that...

112
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,540
...I can't feel any...

113
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,870
Mima-rin! Don't leave us! Don't quit!

114
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,040
Mima-rin! Mima-rin!

115
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,080
Thank you.

116
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,550
I'm always looking at Mima's Room!

117
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,700
Geez! This cheese already went bad!

118
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,260
I'm sorry...
I forgot to feed you yesterday.

119
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,380
The earthquake that
happened in Mie prefecture...

120
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,410
...flattened towns
throughout the region.

121
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,420
The government reports 200 dead,
but the total number of victims are...

122
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:30,450
...yet to be determined since many
more are missing amid the rubble.

123
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,590
Authorities have called in
troops for rescue operations...

124
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,760
...however, because the area
is already getting dark...

125
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,800
Thanks for all the work over the years.

126
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,300
Bye bye, Mima the pop idol.

127
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,940
"Sing for us forever"...

128
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,780
I really can't do that.

129
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:11,190
"I always like looking into Mima's Room.
I've put up a link to Mima's Room."

130
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,840
What is this?

131
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,710
Hello?

132
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,710
Mima! You're home!

133
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,360
Mom!

134
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,620
Yeah, I'm fine! How are you?

135
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,790
Really?

136
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,890
Yeah. Today was the last one.
No more singing for me.

137
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,870
I remember when you kept saying
you wanted to be a singer.

138
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,000
This is my big chance!
I told you that already!

139
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,470
Lately, we've all been looking
forward to each new single!

140
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,040
Your uncle over in Yamaguchi
buys 20 copies every time!

141
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,380
You just don't understand
this industry, Mom.

142
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,010
Wasn't singing what you were best at?

143
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,850
The pop idol image is suffocating me!

144
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,650
Besides, nowadays pop idols are...

145
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,790
Wait, I've got a call
on the other line...

146
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,330
Yes, Kirigoe here...

147
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,370
Hello?

148
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,700
Hello?

149
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:28,830
Mom? Just a wrong number.

150
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,880
Yeah, I know.

151
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,250
Oh, wait! The bath!

152
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,580
Call me back in five minutes.

153
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,890
Oh, Mother!

154
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,400
A fax? Who's it from?

155
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Traitor. TRAITOR. Traitor.
TRAITOR. Traitor...

156
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,960
Who are you?

157
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,850
"Who are you?"

158
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,290
"Who are you?"

159
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,910
Do you know what
that note means, Rumi-chan?

160
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,450
It's an Internet home page.

161
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,490
Oh, that thing that's
been popular lately!

162
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,260
...and what is it?

163
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,490
How can I describe it?

164
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,000
It's kind of like computer networks.

165
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,160
And?

166
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,330
Considering that this person
"put up a link to Mima's Room"...

167
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,610
...this "Mima's Room" thing
is the title of a web site.

168
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,940
You don't get it, do you?

169
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,380
Nope. Not one bit.

170
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,110
All right!

171
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,440
Sorry to keep you waiting.

172
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,350
We're ready for the take!

173
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,590
Don't make me laugh!

174
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,100
You're laughing on your own!

175
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,460
5 seconds!

176
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,930
4, 3, 2...

177
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,000
The younger sister of Rika,
the murder victim, is here.

178
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,270
Would you like to see her?

179
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,050
Yamashiro-kun.

180
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:48,680
Do you know why the culprit peels
off the skin of his victims?

181
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:53,210
I assume he gets sexual stimulation
from such activities...

182
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,539
He wants to become one.

183
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,540
Become... what?

184
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,460
A woman... or...

185
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,570
CUT!

186
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,860
Ochiai Eri-san is a great
actress after all!

187
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,390
She's a completely different
person when the camera is rolling!

188
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,740
That's good!

189
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,580
NEXT! Scene 32!

190
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,770
Rika's sister, you're on!

191
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,540
Here!

192
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,810
Hold this!

193
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,510
Nervous?

194
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,570
A bit.

195
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,180
Not much to get nervous about
when you have only one line...

196
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,960
How's our star actress?

197
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,930
Tadokoro-san. She's just going on now.

198
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,500
"Who are you?"

199
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,170
"Who are you?"

200
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,140
"Who..."

201
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,910
That's what I mean!

202
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,270
Good morning!

203
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,710
Morning!

204
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,060
Good morning.

205
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,410
Hello, everyone.

206
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,950
Good morning.

207
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,750
Shibuya-sensei! You're here too?

208
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,159
Hi, Eri-san. How's it going?

209
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,950
Sir, your lines are too hard!
I don't want to do it anymore!

210
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,190
Don't say that!

211
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,820
But the story is really good!!
I love stuff like this!

212
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,330
You're good at egging people on!

213
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,240
Eri-san. There were this many fan
letters sent to the station!

214
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,240
Thank you, Tejima-san.

215
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,040
Kuro-chan...

216
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,060
Oh, this one's not for you.

217
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,680
Well, keep up the good work.

218
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,550
So, Sensei, tell me!

219
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,590
Who's the criminal?

220
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,350
Sorry, can't tell you.
That'd spoil the fun.

221
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,130
So what ARE you going to
do about the criminal?

222
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,130
You're gonna have to make
your mind up soon.

223
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,300
Good morning, Tejima-san! Shibuya-sensei!

224
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,740
Oh, hello there...

225
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:29,070
Mima-chan's getting good reviews.
Even among station staff.

226
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,760
If that's the case, don't you
think she's got too few lines?

227
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,680
So he says, Shibuya-chan.

228
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,720
Hey, don't look at me!

229
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:43,770
Sensei! Please! Make use of Mima
just a little bit more!

230
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,590
But see... She's a pop idol, right?

231
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,030
They're really hard to use...

232
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,500
That's no problem!
She's done with being a pop idol!

233
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,760
Really?

234
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,330
We want to give her
a drastic image change, too.

235
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,530
We're ready for the take!

236
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,620
Oh, this is for Mima.

237
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,650
"Who are you?"

238
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,980
"Who are you?"

239
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,680
5 seconds!

240
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,810
4, 3, 2...

241
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,720
Tadokoro-san!?

242
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,730
Tadokoro-san!

243
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,460
Tadokoro-san!!

244
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,780
I'm all right...

245
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,610
What the hell is this!?

246
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,050
I think that letter just exploded!?

247
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,010
Call an ambulance! An ambulance!

248
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,790
Yes!

249
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:47,850
...is a warning.
The next one will be REAL.

250
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,350
We're all set now.

251
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,780
Rumi-chan, you're really amazing!

252
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,650
I'll sign you up for
online services now.

253
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,720
Okay.

254
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,190
What do you think, Rumi-chan?

255
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,420
About what?

256
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,520
About that thing the other day.

257
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,970
Oh, that...

258
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,400
Credit card number...

259
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,200
Shouldn't we have called the police?

260
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,040
Tadokoro-san said not to.
We can't do anything about it.

261
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,870
But it was a crime!

262
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,060
And it might have been me!

263
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,920
It's okay. It was just a prank.

264
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,390
Fortunately, Tadokoro-san
wasn't badly hurt.

265
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,790
So you shouldn't worry, Mima.

266
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,060
Anyway, Mima, I'll explain
all of this so listen carefully.

267
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,329
Okay!

268
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:08,090
This is a browser for
the World Wide Web.

269
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,360
You launch it by double-clicking here.

270
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,330
Wha? Double-clip?

271
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,170
What are you going to do with a clip?

272
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,610
But...

273
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,740
See, next to "location"
you enter the URL.

274
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,650
It's not hard, is it?

275
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,580
Come on, Rumi-chan!

276
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,420
Can't you explain it to me in Japanese?

277
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,980
Boy! Why did you buy a computer when
you don't know anything about it?

278
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,890
Because they said it was easy!

279
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,900
Oh, all right. I'll explain it
from the beginning once more...

280
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,990
Okay!

281
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:49,000
H... T... T... P...

282
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,990
Ooh, something came up!

283
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,470
Hey, I'm doing pretty well!

284
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,170
...And now...

285
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,940
There it is!

286
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,110
Welcome to Mima's Room

287
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,370
Welcome to Mima's Room

288
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:10,310
Mima's Diary

289
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,480
What's this?

290
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,920
"It was just terrible!"

291
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,550
"I screwed up the choreography,
AND forgot my lyrics."

292
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,030
"I feel so sorry to all my fans!"

293
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:21,230
"This morning, when I got off
the train left foot first..."

294
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,490
"...was when all
the bad stuff started."

295
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,120
"I always make it a point
that my right foot..."

296
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,360
"...goes first into the
train and into the bath."

297
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,630
Someone sure knows me! What's this?

298
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,039
"Today was my 21 st birthday."

299
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:41,049
"Yukiko, Rei, and the staff at the agency
held a party for me. It was terrific!"

300
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:44,980
"Coming home, I went grocery
shopping at the usual store."

301
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,049
"I got mineral water and milk."

302
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,780
"The milk just has
to be Cow Brand milk."

303
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,450
"I have to allow myself
at least this much luxury."

304
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,560
"And food for my
precious fish, of course..."

305
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,570
"May 12th. I was impressed with Ochiai
Eri-san's performance in Double Bind."

306
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,670
"She's another person
when the camera is rolling..."

307
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,970
What is all this?

308
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,130
How do they know this much?

309
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,730
Who are you?

310
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,440
Who are you?

311
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,310
Who are you?

312
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,870
Who are you?

313
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,850
Who are you?

314
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,470
Who are you?

315
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,730
Who are you?

316
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,320
I'm Dr. Toko Asamiya,
specializing in psychiatry.

317
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,270
I was your late sister's psychiatrist.

318
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,460
There are some things I'd like to ask you.

319
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,530
Detective Yamashiro! Another one!

320
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,700
What!?

321
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,260
This is the fifth victim...

322
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,720
Just three shots.

323
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,740
Is this work really
worth leaving CHAM for?

324
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,640
Rumi-chan. Do you know how hard
it is to get a character...

325
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,610
...that reappears in a drama series?
Even a role like this?

326
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,740
Yes, I do. But...

327
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:33,199
This is where Mima proves if she can
be seen as a real actress or not.

328
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,990
But we should sell Mima as a pop idol!

329
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:41,710
Really. Times are different from when
Hidaka Rumi was a working pop idol.

330
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,400
I know that.

331
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,560
Nowadays, there are no places for
pop idols to appeal to the masses.

332
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,070
This is the branch point that
will decide if Mima lasts or not.

333
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,220
Well, excuse me for not surviving.

334
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,240
Please, Rumi-chan!

335
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:58,980
There's nothing better than having Mima
be able to change into an actress!

336
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:01,990
She came to Tokyo to sing...

337
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,020
Think!

338
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,030
On record sales we
make practically nothing!

339
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,760
But I do wish that they'd
use her a little bit more...

340
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,500
Sorry we're not that profitable!

341
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,990
Good morning!

342
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,130
How's the new CHAM going?

343
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:32,570
Double Bind

344
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,630
It's the pits!

345
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,320
Double Bind... yeah, I saw it too.

346
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,239
It was so boring!

347
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,590
Why do all psycho-thrillers made
in Japan turn out that way?

348
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,940
Mima-rin's not in it!

349
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,750
Oh yeah. How many scenes was
she in last week? Four?

350
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,240
Three.

351
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,680
Somebody save Mima-rin! PLEASE!

352
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:11,860
A HOME PAGE ON THE INTERNET:
You can make one too!

353
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,880
This morning, when I got off the train
left foot first...

354
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,510
Hey, It's Mima-rin!

355
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,310
Good morning!

356
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,869
Good morning, Mima-rin!

357
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,180
Break a leg with that drama series!

358
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,230
Hey, wait, Mima-rin...

359
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:25,960
Do they get all unfriendly when
they become actresses?

360
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,029
Hit-And-Run at Shinkaido.

361
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:40,530
Tadashi Doi (18) in critical condition.

362
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,860
Good morning!

363
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,120
Good morning, Mima.

364
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,090
Cheers!

365
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,430
Cheers!

366
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,960
What's going on?

367
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,080
CHAM's new single...

368
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:11,630
Oh, wow! They got 83rd?

369
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,540
We never even made the charts before.

370
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:15,580
One, two...

371
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,010
Congratulations!

372
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,650
We did it!

373
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,710
Now we've got to work
together really hard!

374
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,620
But will there be anyone
in the audience?

375
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,220
Sure there will be, Mima!

376
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:36,500
Your next script. It has a few more lines.

377
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,900
Yeah.

378
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,430
You've both done great!

379
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:43,940
CHAM is totally okay being a duo!

380
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,620
Hey, you. Are you currently
in any talent agency?

381
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,850
I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.

382
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,600
Hey!

383
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,360
Wouldn't you be interested
in being a model?

384
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,670
Model?

385
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,860
Cut!

386
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,080
OK! We're going to move
for the next scene!

387
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,920
Who's that girl?

388
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,510
I don't know.

389
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,530
Hey, hey, hey!

390
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,760
I saw next week's script,
Shibuya-chan. You're wonderful!

391
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:44,030
I didn't think it would come to this!

392
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,540
To tell the truth,
I have an even more drastic idea.

393
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,970
Fantastic!

394
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,670
But...

395
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,900
I wonder if it would be
all right for Mima...

396
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,400
...or rather, her agency.

397
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,580
Mima's character, Takakura Yoko, changes...

398
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,620
...personalities completely when she's
raped by the customers at a strip show.

399
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,790
You're crazy! A rape scene!?

400
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,630
She's the key figure in the second half
of the series! It's an important role!

401
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,420
But Mima's a pop idol!

402
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,830
Don't worry, Mima.

403
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,929
We'll ask the producer
and get it changed.

404
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,000
Hey, hey. Wait a minute!

405
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,510
The scripts are already behind schedule
as is, and the art staff is getting antsy!

406
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,040
How will it look if we
make it worse by arguing?

407
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,050
I even told Shibuya-sensei that she was
changing out from a pop idol!

408
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,990
It's our job to protect
the celebrities in our agency!

409
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,460
There's no way Mima
can do such a thing!

410
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,190
It's all right, Rumi-chan.

411
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,390
I'll do it.

412
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,699
Because I decided
that I WILL become an actress.

413
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,330
Mima!

414
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,670
I see. You're really wonderful, Mima!

415
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:56,670
This kind of thing is commonplace for
actresses! Jodie whatshername did it too!

416
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,210
Mima, please think it out.

417
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,210
Do you realize what will
happen as a result of this?

418
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,870
It's not as if I'm
really getting raped!

419
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,320
Although... I'm sure my parents
will flip when they see me like that.

420
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,990
Anyway, I'll do it.
I'll give it my best shot.

421
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,990
Mima...

422
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,830
I absolutely REFUSE to do it!

423
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,060
Well, Mr. Director? How does the set look?

424
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,360
I'd prefer to shoot in a real club...

425
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,060
...but considering what we're filming,
nobody will let us shoot at their place.

426
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,830
Sheesh!

427
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,840
Please, I'm counting on you.

428
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:09,680
Hey, hey, hey, come on, Yada-kun!

429
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,870
What are you going to do with just
the DATE of the next meeting!?

430
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:16,480
That doesn't make for
much of a meeting!

431
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,880
OK here!

432
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,390
We're ready to shoot!

433
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,390
Scene 48, "The manager gets
dragged down", take 1!

434
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,370
Ten seconds...

435
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,640
5, 4, 3, 2...

436
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,730
Mmmm! Looks good!

437
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:09,710
Ex-pop idols sure make a nice scene!

438
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,770
No! Stop! Let me go!

439
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,740
Cut it off! Get off the stage!

440
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:15,910
Shut the fuck up!

441
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,450
Get out of here! I'll call the police!

442
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,810
You think I give a shit about cops?

443
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,769
Stop!

444
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:20,910
Hands off!

445
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,720
Stop it!

446
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,780
Let me go! Stop it!

447
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,990
Help! Help me! No!

448
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,440
Please! NO!

449
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:47,010
Cut!

450
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,970
Hey, over there, hold your places!

451
00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:00,520
OK! Now move the cameras!

452
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,360
I'm so sorry...

453
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,990
Oh, no, it's all right.

454
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,560
OK, next up, the rape scene!

455
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,600
Everyone, get ready!

456
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,530
Take 1! Rolling!

457
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,830
No! Stop! No! No! Stop!

458
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,890
Please! Stop!

459
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,050
Cut!

460
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,020
No, no, no! FASTER!

461
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:38,090
Sorry!

462
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,059
Once again, from the top!

463
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,560
No break yet! Take 2!

464
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,780
Please! Stop!

465
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,180
No! Please! NO!

466
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,580
Stop it! No!

467
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,880
Please!

468
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:59,670
Mima-rin!!

469
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,390
I'm so tired!

470
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,169
Hey, where's Rumi-chan?

471
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:34,200
Hmm? Oh, she had a meeting
to go to for me...

472
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,840
Hey, Mima...

473
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,080
You know...

474
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,520
Nothing. You tried so hard...

475
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,560
As a reward for your efforts,
I'll treat you to a delicious meal.

476
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,650
Lucky me!

477
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,470
I'm home, fishies!

478
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,170
I wonder if you're hungry yet?

479
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,460
Of course I didn't want to do it!

480
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,390
But I couldn't trouble all the
people who brought me this far!!

481
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:15,440
See, didn't I tell you?

482
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,950
Is that the job that you wanted?

483
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,780
That was the PITS!

484
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,700
I don't want to do that drama anymore!

485
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:42,830
The producer is a total pervert,
and my role is really screwed up!

486
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:47,440
Singing in front of my fans
has GOT to be the best for me after all!

487
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,520
Oh... that scene?

488
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:04,250
Of course I would be lying if I said
I didn't have any hesitations...

489
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:09,230
...but I looked at it as a hurdle
I had to jump over as an actress.

490
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,210
I heard the ratings went up.

491
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,200
As always, the public
at large are all idiots.

492
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,340
Yes. I'd like to be
recognized as an actress.

493
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,000
Not as "the ex-pop idol"?

494
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,170
You got it!

495
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:25,680
I was fine coz Rei was
always the one I liked.

496
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,720
I'm sure all the Mima-rin fans
are crying right about now.

497
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:35,060
But CHAM did teach me a lot. It was
a great experience in its own way.

498
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,250
Yeah, totally!

499
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:41,990
They're probably whining,
"That's not Mima-rin!"

500
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:55,260
Welcome to Mima's Room

501
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:59,210
What was YOUR day like?

502
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,080
"Today, I was still
a little depressed..."

503
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:05,220
"...but receiving e-mail from all
of you made me feel a little better."

504
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,190
E-mail?

505
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,590
"June 24: Help me, everyone..."

506
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,000
"Everyone is forcing me to do it!
It's all the screenwriter's fault!"

507
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,470
Help! Help! Help! Help!

508
00:39:18,471 --> 00:39:21,731
This... This isn't true!
I'm not writing any of this!

509
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:25,740
Of course! The REAL Mima is writing this!

510
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:31,680
I know that deep down in your heart
you want to be a pop idol again.

511
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:32,720
No!

512
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,720
I'm no longer...

513
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,810
No longer what?

514
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:40,260
Oh, yeah, you're no longer a pop idol.

515
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,350
You're a filthy woman now.

516
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:46,929
Nobody likes idols with
tarnished reputations!

517
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,929
That's not true! That's not true!

518
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:51,730
Mima-rin!

519
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,270
You can't step back into
that spotlight now...

520
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,940
But that's all right. I'M here.

521
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:11,080
From now on, I'll be in the light,
and you'll be in the shadows.

522
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,489
What are you saying!?

523
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,580
Who in the world are you!?

524
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,960
Nobody likes you anymore.

525
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:21,289
You're tarnished! FILTHY!

526
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,299
Stop! Stop it!

527
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,230
I am not tarnished!

528
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,870
Wait!

529
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,050
WAIT!

530
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:16,580
Love makes your heart race.

531
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:19,820
If it means you're loved in the end...

532
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:23,020
...be much more aggressive...

533
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:26,390
...because you will get a chance.

534
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:32,060
The angel of love smiles at you.

535
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,630
Is anyone there?

536
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:47,089
Can you see the angel's white wings?

537
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:51,420
Or her eyes gazing at you...

538
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:55,520
...her sweet voice, her gentle hands?

539
00:41:55,590 --> 00:42:00,099
She is here just for you.

540
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,300
She is protecting you...

541
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:08,400
...from somewhere nearby.

542
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:13,109
Got a question about...

543
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:16,770
Love makes your heart race.

544
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:20,010
If it means you're loved in the end...

545
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,120
...be much more aggressive...

546
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,160
It happened about 1 o'clock this morning.

547
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:06,020
Hey, I called you last
night and you weren't in...

548
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:10,060
"Oh shit! How did you know?" Yeah, right.

549
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,160
Did you see "Mima's Room"?

550
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,830
Yeah, but is that really her?

551
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:16,530
No clue.

552
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:19,370
According to that page,
Mima-rin's gonna be on stage today.

553
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,910
No way!

554
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:26,190
Police say Shibuya was stabbed
umpteen times with a sharp object...

555
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,089
Popular Script Writer SLAUGHTERED!!
The victim: Shibuya Takao (34)

556
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:33,610
It sure is a shocking incident,
but us worrying about it won't help.

557
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,220
We have to put our
minds on something else.

558
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:38,200
But there was that letter bomb too...

559
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:42,700
You think Shibuya-sensei's murder
is connected with that?

560
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:46,440
I didn't say that...

561
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:50,960
You watch too many TV tabloid shows.
Don't worry about it.

562
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,140
You won't become a star
looking like that! Smile!

563
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,910
Serves...

564
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:03,780
...you...

565
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,230
...right!?

566
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:19,410
What's wrong? Mima! MIMA!

567
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:26,500
But will Mima be all right?

568
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,010
Why?

569
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,450
That photographer specializes
in getting people to strip!

570
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,000
So what?

571
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,450
She's got that part down pat!

572
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,280
I'm sure she's totally showing it
off in front of the photographer!

573
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,820
Like, TOTALLY!

574
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,380
Isn't it time you were on? Hurry up.

575
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,690
Yes'm.

576
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:54,060
Oooh... I like that expression.

577
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,610
Try running your fingers
through your hair.

578
00:44:55,611 --> 00:44:58,070
Oh, I like this.

579
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,660
It's great!

580
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:06,940
Perfume isn't for me.
And when I caught the scent...

581
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,510
Yeah, just like that.
Part your lips a little...

582
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:12,670
Great. Now let's
take the top off too...

583
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,890
I'd rather wear jeans...

584
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:25,889
...than tight business suits.

585
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:32,060
This year, I'll not exert
myself and dress casually.

586
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:41,380
I wanted to be a woman that suited you...

587
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:45,320
...but I knew we would
drift apart even if...

588
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:51,660
...I kept standing on my tippy-toes.

589
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:58,730
I thought you decided to
go through with this!

590
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,760
Everyone is waiting for you!

591
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,410
Come on, Mima!

592
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,680
See? Didn't I tell you?

593
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,150
You were better off as a pop idol.

594
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,580
Hey Mima, are you listening?

595
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:16,750
Stop all this nonsense! Who are you!?

596
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:19,920
Me? I'm a pop idol.

597
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:22,050
Everyone's waiting for me.

598
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:25,960
So I'm going to sing with Rei
and Yukiko again.

599
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:27,500
No, I'm not!

600
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:30,090
I'm an actress!

601
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:31,500
Don't be silly!

602
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,669
No one really wants that!

603
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,460
Wait!

604
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,100
What everyone wants is...

605
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:40,920
...from comics than difficult books and...

606
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:45,760
...I want to stay the way I am forever.

607
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,050
Walking past, making a breeze...

608
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:53,610
...burning the scenery into my memories.

609
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:56,720
I am fine even if I'm alone.

610
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:04,990
I have finally found
a luxurious loneliness.

611
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,370
Thank you, everyone!

612
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,645
June 27th: Thank you for
coming to the event today!

613
00:47:22,646 --> 00:47:25,150
It really is the best feeling
to sing in front of all of you!

614
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,280
BASTARDS!!

615
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:44,830
Kirigoe Mima Leaving
the Throne of a Pop Idol!!

616
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:55,820
Huh?

617
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:58,010
Hey!

618
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,720
What are you doing?

619
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,650
To ME-MANIA-san:
Thank you for your e-mail every day.

620
00:48:29,651 --> 00:48:31,330
...You believe me, right?

621
00:48:31,331 --> 00:48:34,331
That's not me. She's an impostor!

622
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,730
Of course. Mima-rin
would never do such a thing.

623
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:39,390
I will protect you, the real Mima-rin.

624
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:44,100
I trust you, ME-MANIA-san.

625
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:46,530
I won't change one bit.

626
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,469
I'll always be with you.

627
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:51,910
But that impostor keeps
getting in my way.

628
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,670
What should I do?

629
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:59,530
I'll get rid of her.

630
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:03,280
Thank you, Me-mania-san!

631
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:09,430
You're the only one I can depend on.

632
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,630
I don't know anything
about myself anymore!

633
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,010
Well...

634
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,010
How do you think you
know that person you were...

635
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,070
...a second ago is the
same person you are now?

636
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:34,240
A continuous stream of memories.

637
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:37,750
Given only that, we all create
illusions within ourselves...

638
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:41,280
...saying that we each have
only one fixed persona.

639
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,950
Sensei, I'm scared...

640
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:47,690
...that my other self will do
something that I don't know about...

641
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:53,130
It's all right. There is no way
illusions can come to life.

642
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,250
CUT!

643
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,610
Mima-chan, what's wrong?

644
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,249
I'm sorry!

645
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:07,280
Oh, man! This rain sucks!

646
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:08,750
I think I'm going to catch a cold!

647
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:11,120
I'm sorry!

648
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,140
Wrap it up! Wrap it up!!

649
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:33,130
It's pouring really badly outside,
but your heart is always, like, sunny!

650
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:34,730
Well, I think we're ready today!

651
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,370
Welcome to Rei...

652
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:36,280
...and Yukiko's...

653
00:50:36,281 --> 00:50:39,180
..."Idol Chamland"!

654
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,780
Tadokoro-san?

655
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:45,580
I'm sure they're on the air now.

656
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,720
I thought you'd like to see
them coz it's been a while.

657
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:56,790
We have a show this Sunday.
It's at Ibaragi Sim City at 2pm.

658
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,530
- People from all over, come see us!
- How have you been?

659
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:02,000
- We'll be waiting for you!
- Just thought I'd drop by.

660
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:06,170
Chamland will be back next week
at the same time. Until then...

661
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,540
Two, three...

662
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:09,149
Bye bye!

663
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:12,150
Good show, guys.

664
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,150
Hey, it's Mima.

665
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:18,160
Mima!

666
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:48,980
Wait!

667
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:51,980
Who are you!?

668
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:03,730
I told you! I'm the REAL Mima.

669
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:39,130
In other news...

670
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,600
Today, the Economic Planning Agency
announced a "New Citizen's Life Index"...

671
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:46,200
...that indicates the overall
Japanese standard of living and...

672
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:51,180
It feels like I haven't
seen you in a long time.

673
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,310
Well, I've been busy too.

674
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:56,110
So, are you getting used to acting?

675
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:57,550
Yeah.

676
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:00,720
It's hard, but I chose to do it.

677
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:04,090
You've matured quite a bit, Mima!

678
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,730
But it's good that people seem
to like the new Mima.

679
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:10,730
Yeah...

680
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:14,490
That doesn't look like
a face that's agreeing.

681
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:18,740
You know... Mima...
Has someone been harassing you?

682
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,240
I've been visiting that home page.

683
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:27,040
It's a bit much, even if it's a complaint
about how you changed your image...

684
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:29,840
It's better if you didn't look at it.

685
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,350
Yeah...

686
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,860
But maybe she is more
like me than myself.

687
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,590
Mima?

688
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:38,750
My other self that I buried
deep within my heart.

689
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:39,850
What if...

690
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:43,460
What if that other personality
suddenly started acting on its own?

691
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:47,590
It's all right. There is no
way illusions can come to life.

692
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:48,190
Rumi-chan?

693
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:49,140
CUT!

694
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:52,330
Mima-chan! What are you saying?

695
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,310
I feel like I'm gonna have
nightmares about this line!

696
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,580
I'm sorry!

697
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:10,560
What's wrong?

698
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:12,960
Uh, nothing...

699
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:20,360
Once more, from the top...

700
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:23,970
All right, Take 2!

701
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,170
In other news...

702
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:32,650
Today, the Economic Planning Agency
announced a "New Citizen's Life Index"...

703
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,270
...that indicates the overall
Japanese standard of living and...

704
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,160
It's been a while, Rumi-chan.

705
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:44,740
What? I was here yesterday, too!

706
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:49,750
Yesterday? Was that real?

707
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:53,830
You're weird, Mima.

708
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,670
Mima! What's wrong with you!?

709
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:59,370
You're bleeding!

710
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:05,380
This blood is real, isn't it?

711
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:07,300
Mima!

712
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:13,570
Today I went shopping in Harajuku.
I'm a sucker for sale items.

713
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,530
I guess... I went to Harajuku today...

714
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:32,640
You mean...

715
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:36,080
...the murderer is an
illusion she created?

716
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:37,170
Yes.

717
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:40,280
She fears an imaginary
security guard...

718
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:45,180
...and then doubles that figure with
the serial murderer of top models.

719
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:48,140
But illusions don't kill.

720
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:53,180
But... what if that illusion
found someone to possess?

721
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,930
Possess??

722
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,300
Then... all those men
who got murdered?

723
00:55:57,370 --> 00:56:01,060
Were those who were no
longer of any use to her.

724
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,830
Find her quickly, Yamashiro-kun.

725
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:08,660
Before another victim falls prey.

726
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:14,420
How much?

727
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:21,580
You sure are a weird pizza man.

728
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:59,890
Stop! Please stop!

729
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:15,770
Yeah, that looks good... Come on,
be more daring! More passionate!

730
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:30,360
All right! Take three!

731
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:48,880
Hello?

732
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:49,380
Mima-san?

733
00:57:49,381 --> 00:57:52,010
Are you all right over there?

734
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,350
You haven't heard yet...
about Murano-san?

735
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:58,350
Can't be!

736
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:02,479
Police say that Murano
died of multiple stab wounds...

737
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,520
Mr. Murano!? Really!?

738
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:07,900
We're going crazy here!

739
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:11,699
Anyway, stay put until I get there.
All right!?

740
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:15,190
The weapon used in the latest murder
is said to closely resemble...

741
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:18,900
...the one used in last week's
killing of a popular screenwriter.

742
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:22,669
Police are considering a personal
grudge as the motive...

743
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:26,840
...and are looking into connections
between the two cases.

744
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,550
Kirigoe-san! Please, can we get your
opinion about the murder of Murano-san?

745
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:03,280
Do you know anything?

746
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:07,289
Isn't there a connection with the
killing of Shibuya-san the screenwriter?

747
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:10,160
Kirigoe-san! There are rumors
of a love triangle...

748
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:13,260
...between you, Shibuya-san,
and Murano-san and we...

749
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:20,700
You think she's jinxed?

750
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:22,809
What happens twice happens thrice.

751
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:24,840
Let's take bets on who's next.

752
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:26,380
Cut it out!

753
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,310
Don't mind them.

754
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:32,070
Am I alive?

755
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:38,780
Maybe that truck hit me...
and this is all a dream...

756
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:41,190
Everyone ready?

757
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:43,620
OK. Mima-chan!

758
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,570
Breathe harder than during rehearsal.

759
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,830
You've just killed someone.

760
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,630
Yes.

761
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:10,580
And... action!

762
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,860
Are you awake?

763
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:25,860
You are?

764
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:28,430
Can you tell me your name?

765
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,300
Me? I'm Kirigoe Mima.

766
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,280
Okay. And what do you do?

767
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:38,440
I'm a pop idol... no, an actress.

768
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,240
That must be hard work.

769
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,910
It's hard, but it's what I chose to do.

770
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:50,260
She thinks she's a new young
actress named Kirigoe Mima.

771
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:57,830
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

772
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,800
In other words,
"multiple personality syndrome."

773
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:05,810
All those crimes took place
when she was some other persona.

774
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:09,140
So where's the persona
of the original Yoko?

775
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:11,770
Takakura Yoko, the original persona...

776
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:16,150
...is nothing more than a character
in a drama for her.

777
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:21,410
Being a "normal" girl...
how she was raped in a strip club...

778
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:23,980
Everything happened as part
of her drama series.

779
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:27,620
By doing so, she salvaged her heart.

780
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:33,800
That's right. I'm an actress.

781
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:36,610
Cut!

782
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,970
Can you tell me your name?

783
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,380
Me? I'm Takakura Rika.

784
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:48,810
The original persona,
Takakura Yoko, no longer exists.

785
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:54,980
By killing, and later becoming, her sister
the top-model, she salvaged her heart.

786
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:01,330
That's right. I'm a model.

787
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,560
All right! That's the take!

788
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,040
We did it, Mima-chan!

789
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:19,600
Mima... Good work!

790
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,510
I can tell you tried so hard!

791
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:22,859
Rumi-chan...

792
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:27,480
As of this moment,
Double Bind is in the can!

793
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,920
Everyone, great job!

794
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:50,950
You were fantastic, Mima-chan!
What do you think, Director?

795
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:53,240
She really was excellent.

796
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,940
Thanks a lot.

797
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,580
See you at the wrap-up party.

798
01:02:56,650 --> 01:02:59,780
We'll be talking to you.

799
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,620
Then... shall we go as well?

800
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:04,090
Mima, go get changed.

801
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:20,270
Touko-san...

802
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:24,580
Hey now! I'm not Touko anymore!
Did you forget?

803
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:29,050
"There is no way illusions
can come to life."

804
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,550
You should stop dreaming soon.

805
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:44,660
Eri-san?

806
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,300
What's taking Mima so long?

807
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:54,540
I'm going back to the office.
Take Mima home, will ya?

808
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:58,210
Tadokoro-san. You were saying
something about Mima's next job?

809
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:01,170
Oh, it's great!

810
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:02,880
A starring role in a video movie.

811
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:07,320
There are a few sketchy scenes...
but what can you do?

812
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:13,490
Somebody help me!

813
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:18,830
Like anyone can hear YOUR voice right now!

814
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:22,190
Who are you!?

815
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:23,600
Why are you doing this!?

816
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:26,440
I'm protecting my dear Mima-rin!

817
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:28,840
But-But I'm Mima!

818
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,739
No, no, no, no, NO!

819
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:35,550
You didn't know I was Me-mania!

820
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:37,390
You're just PRETENDING to be Mima-rin!

821
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:40,150
STOP!

822
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:42,590
NO! STOP!

823
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:50,720
Did you fool that screenwriter and that
photographer with this little mouth?

824
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,360
You tarnished Mima-rin's name!

825
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:57,530
Can it be... that you...

826
01:04:57,610 --> 01:05:01,270
The real Mima-rin e-mails me every day!

827
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:03,280
And she says that you
keep getting in her way!

828
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:05,210
You killed them!?

829
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,410
And you'll die soon, too!

830
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,760
Bad girl!

831
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:26,170
You have to follow the script!

832
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:31,140
And now... TAKE 2!

833
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,230
All right! Looks good!!

834
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:15,270
You're the best, Mima-san!

835
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,200
Mima!

836
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:37,430
What's wrong? You're in shambles!

837
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,330
I was looking all over for you!

838
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,200
Rumi-chan...

839
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:43,760
What in the world happened?

840
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,850
This can't be!!

841
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:00,750
Are you sure you weren't dreaming?

842
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:13,860
Are you all right?

843
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:16,250
I'm taking you back... to Mima's room.

844
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:40,390
Rumi-chan, are you here?

845
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:41,790
What?

846
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:43,060
Oh, nothing...

847
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:48,440
Oh, that's right,
I have to call Tadokoro-san.

848
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,900
No... This isn't my room...

849
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:56,500
Of course not! This is Mima's room!

850
01:09:57,870 --> 01:09:59,240
You're!

851
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:02,610
Look! It's the new costume!

852
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,740
I'm wearing it at tomorrow's show!

853
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:09,220
Isn't it great? It's perfect on me!

854
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:13,620
Rumi-chan? Why?

855
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:17,390
Rumi-chan?

856
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:20,050
Rumi-chan...

857
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:22,430
Oh! Rumi-chan went home.

858
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,640
She said she's been busy lately
and was deprived of sleep.

859
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:27,430
Don't say weird stuff like that!

860
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,030
This is a joke, isn't it, Rumi-chan!?

861
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:32,400
Love makes your heart race.

862
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:36,410
If it means you're loved in the end...

863
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,450
What do you think? Perfect, huh?

864
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:41,150
A pop idol HAS to sing, after all!

865
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:42,850
But...

866
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:45,050
You just had to keep getting in my way.

867
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,390
Rumi-chan was totally furious, too.

868
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:50,250
Please... stop all of this!

869
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:54,560
But a pop idol is always
protected by her fans!

870
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:57,830
They listen to any favor I, Mima, ask them!

871
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:01,500
Although Me-mania-san
failed a wee bit...

872
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:05,340
Me-mania? How do you know him!?

873
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:10,850
But, oh, well..."you reap what
you sow," especially about YOU.

874
01:12:52,850 --> 01:12:55,610
Help! Somebody help me!

875
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,460
Please! Rumi-chan, it's you, isn't it!?

876
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:11,970
PLEASE WAKE UP!

877
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:14,980
YOU'RE the one who needs to wake up!

878
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:24,310
Help, help, somebody!

879
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:27,750
Help! SOMEBODY HELP ME!

880
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:35,250
SOMEBODY! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!

881
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:41,960
HELP! SOMEBODY HELP ME!

882
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,520
Let's end all of this.

883
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,860
We don't need two Mimas!

884
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:17,590
I AM MIMA!

885
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:21,760
That's funny! Mima is a pop idol!

886
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,200
You're just a dirty old impostor!

887
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:28,140
LIKE I CARE! I AM WHO I AM!!

888
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:38,489
Oh, shit!

889
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:40,710
Get the police! No, call an ambulance!

890
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:43,050
I know!

891
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:45,070
Thank you for the flowers
you always bring.

892
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:46,940
I'll put them in my room.

893
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:49,410
They're pretty. Very pretty...

894
01:16:56,990 --> 01:17:01,330
I didn't know you were visiting.
You must be very busy lately.

895
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,520
Oh, no.

896
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:06,560
Once in a while, she returns
to her Rumi-san persona, but...

897
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,580
I know I'll never see HER ever again.

898
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:15,540
But, thanks to her, I am who I am today.

899
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:28,690
You're lying! There's no way Kirigoe Mima
would be HERE of all places!

900
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,730
I guess she was just a look-alike.

901
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:42,340
No, I'm real!
