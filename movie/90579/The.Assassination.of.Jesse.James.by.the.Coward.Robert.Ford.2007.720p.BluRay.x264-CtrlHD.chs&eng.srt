2
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,717
他正值壮年…
{\fscx70\fscy70}He was growing into middle age...{\r}

3
00:01:13,889 --> 00:01:17,416
…住在森林大道的一座平房里
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and was living then in a bungalow
on Woodland Avenue.{\r}

4
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:21,523
他坐在摇椅里…
{\fscx70\fscy70}He installed himself in a rocking chair...{\r}

5
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:23,756
…在暮色里抽着雪茄…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and smoked a cigar down
in the evenings...{\r}

6
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:26,833
…他的妻子在围裙上擦着粉红的双手…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...as his wife wiped her pink hands
on an apron...{\r}

7
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:30,199
…和他们的两个孩子说着什么
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and reported happily
on their two children.{\r}

8
00:01:36,144 --> 00:01:37,702
孩子们熟悉父亲的双腿…
{\fscx70\fscy70}His children knew his legs...{\r}

9
00:01:38,013 --> 00:01:41,210
…还有他的胡子扎在自己脸上的感觉
{\fscx70\fscy70}...the sting of his mustache
against their cheeks.{\r}

10
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:47,215
但他们不知道父亲如何谋生
也不知道为什么经常要搬家
{\fscx70\fscy70}They didn't know how their father made
his living or why they so often moved.{\r}

11
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,857
他们甚至不知道父亲的名字
{\fscx70\fscy70}They didn't even know
their father's name.{\r}

12
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:57,029
在市政府的名录上
他叫做托马斯・霍华德
{\fscx70\fscy70}He was listed in the city directory
as Thomas Howard.{\r}

13
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,631
走在街上没人认得他…
{\fscx70\fscy70}And he went everywhere unrecognized...{\r}

14
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:02,861
…他时常与堪萨斯城的店主和商人
一起吃午饭…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and lunched with Kansas City
shopkeepers and merchants...{\r}

15
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:06,397
…自称是牧人或者投资商人…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...calling himself a cattleman
or a commodities investor...{\r}

16
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:10,870
…一个平易近人，有钱而又悠闲的人
{\fscx70\fscy70}...someone rich and leisured
who had the common touch.{\r}

17
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:17,418
他的胸口有两处未能痊愈的弹痕…
{\fscx70\fscy70}He had two incompletely healed
bullet holes in his chest...{\r}

18
00:02:17,586 --> 00:02:19,144
…大腿上也有一处
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and another in his thigh.{\r}

19
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:21,846
他左手中指少了两节…
{\fscx70\fscy70}He was missing the nub
of his left middle finger...{\r}

20
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:25,255
…对此他很是小心，唯恐被人看见
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and was cautious,
lest that mutilation be seen.{\r}

21
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:30,760
他还有一种称为“粒状眼睑”的症状…
{\fscx70\fscy70}He also had a condition that was
referred to as "granulated eyelids"...{\r}

22
00:02:30,932 --> 00:02:33,924
…这使得他比常人更频繁的眨眼…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and it caused him
to blink more than usual...{\r}

23
00:02:34,703 --> 00:02:38,833
…好像在他看来
周围的人们让他有点难以接受
{\fscx70\fscy70}...as if he found creation
slightly more than he could accept.{\r}

24
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:43,036
他在的时候，房间似乎更加炎热
{\fscx70\fscy70}Rooms seemed hotter
when he was in them.{\r}

25
00:02:43,512 --> 00:02:45,241
雨似乎下得更频繁
{\fscx70\fscy70}Rains fell straighter.{\r}

26
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:47,178
时间似乎过得更慢
{\fscx70\fscy70}Clocks slowed.{\r}

27
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:50,113
声音被放得更大
{\fscx70\fscy70}Sounds were amplified.{\r}

28
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:54,017
他认为自己是一个
在一场永无终结的内战中…
{\fscx70\fscy70}He considered himself
a Southern loyalist and guerrilla...{\r}

29
00:02:54,189 --> 00:02:57,158
…忠于南方的游击队员
{\fscx70\fscy70}...in a Civil War that never ended.{\r}

30
00:02:57,325 --> 00:03:02,695
对于他做过的抢劫案，以及被控诉的17起谋杀案
他毫不悔过
{\fscx70\fscy70}He regretted neither his robberies,
nor the 17 murders that he laid claim to.{\r}

31
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:13,435
在密苏里州的堪萨斯城
他又迎来了一个新的夏天
{\fscx70\fscy70}He had seen another summer under
in Kansas City, Missouri...{\r}

32
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:17,908
…1881年9月5日…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and on September 5th
in the year 1881...{\r}

33
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:21,709
…他34岁
{\fscx70\fscy70}...he was 34 years old.{\r}

34
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:32,425
你只要…你只要把东西滑进这里
就这里，到你袖子里…
{\fscx70\fscy70}You just... You just slide them things
right in there, right in your sleeve...{\r}

35
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:35,620
…然后等准备好了，就甩出来
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and then, when you get ready,
you just shake it out.{\r}

36
00:03:35,797 --> 00:03:38,129
像那样，看，甩出来
{\fscx70\fscy70}Like that, right there. You shake it out.{\r}

37
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,200
[蓝切地，密苏里州，1881年9月7日]

38
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:45,666
玛丽・托德・林肯，暴君的妻子
在月圆时发疯了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Mary Todd Lincoln, tyrant's wife, fall
into hysterics when the moon was full.{\r}

39
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:48,401
总统的手下会用干草绳把她捆起来…
{\fscx70\fscy70}President's men would tie her up
with hay-baling wire...{\r}

40
00:03:48,577 --> 00:03:50,772
…以免她丈夫的耳朵被她咬掉
{\fscx70\fscy70}...keep her from ripping
her husband's ears off.{\r}

41
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:55,440
你从没听别人说过
杰弗逊・戴维斯的老婆的闲话吧？
（美国内战中南方联邦的总统）
{\fscx70\fscy70}You never heard word one about the wife of
the Confederacy's Jefferson Davis, did you?{\r}

42
00:03:55,617 --> 00:03:56,914
- 没有
- 对，没有
{\fscx70\fscy70}- I didn't.
- No, you didn't.{\r}

43
00:03:57,686 --> 00:04:00,018
她可是她丈夫的贤内助
{\fscx70\fscy70}He did his duty by her.{\r}

44
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:04,915
- 噢，天，忘了你是小孩子了
- 不，我听懂了，我听懂了
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Oh, my God, I'm speaking to children.
- No, I get it, I get it, I get it.{\r}

45
00:04:05,093 --> 00:04:09,291
联邦总统明白妻子的需要
他用高超的技巧和礼节…
{\fscx70\fscy70}The president of the Confederacy discerned
his wife's needs and satisfied them...{\r}

46
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,092
…满足了她
{\fscx70\fscy70}...with the utmost skill
and the utmost courtesy.{\r}

47
00:04:15,904 --> 00:04:19,362
- 查理，你喷得我满鞋子都是
- 对不起，对不起，杰西
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Charley, you spit all over my boot.
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry, Jesse.{\r}

48
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:22,499
- 这里，弄干净
- 我来擦…我会擦干净的
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Here, get it off.
- I'll wipe it... I'll wipe it off.{\r}

49
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:27,040
但亚伯拉罕・林肯也许让他老婆
去疯狂购物了
{\fscx70\fscy70}But Abraham Lincoln probably sent his wife
on a shopping expedition.{\r}

50
00:04:27,215 --> 00:04:30,981
- 一场三幕的戏
- 花的是从我们这偷去的钱
{\fscx70\fscy70}- A three-act play.
- With money stole from us.{\r}

51
00:04:32,053 --> 00:04:33,987
开饭！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Chow!{\r}

52
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,817
我看林肯家双方都有病
{\fscx70\fscy70}I think insanity run on both sides
of that Lincoln family.{\r}

53
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:41,895
你说的没错
{\fscx70\fscy70}You're right about that.{\r}

54
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:44,657
那河…你跳进去
{\fscx70\fscy70}The river... You jump in the river.{\r}

55
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:50,195
- 开饭！
- 别害羞，迪克
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Chow!
- Don't be shy now, Dick.{\r}

56
00:04:50,472 --> 00:04:52,804
- 再来一块肉
- 你骗人多了以后…
{\fscx70\fscy70}- One more piece of meat.
- When you diddle a lot...{\r}

57
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:55,465
给他留了一块很好的培根肥肉
{\fscx70\fscy70}There's a good piece of bacon fat
in there for him.{\r}

58
00:05:30,845 --> 00:05:32,437
打扰了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Excuse me.{\r}

59
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:36,576
我随便散步，没想到打扰你了
{\fscx70\fscy70}I see I've traipsed right on in
and interrupted you.{\r}

60
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,615
那么你是谁？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Who are you, then?{\r}

61
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:43,121
鲍勃・福特
{\fscx70\fscy70}Bob Ford.{\r}

62
00:05:44,526 --> 00:05:45,754
查理的弟弟？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Charley's brother?{\r}

63
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:48,628
对
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah.{\r}

64
00:06:02,777 --> 00:06:05,974
我刚才说谎了，我不是偶尔路过
{\fscx70\fscy70}I was lying when I said
I just happened down here.{\r}

65
00:06:06,147 --> 00:06:10,413
我在找你
我一开始没说实话，是不是很让人讨厌
{\fscx70\fscy70}I've been looking for you. I feel lousy
I didn't say so at the outset.{\r}

66
00:06:12,988 --> 00:06:14,580
因为我给人的第一印象常常很不好…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Folks take me for a nincompoop...{\r}

67
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:18,487
…别人都当我是傻子
但我觉得自己…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...on account of the shabby first impression
I make, whereas I think of myself...{\r}

68
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,094
…只比詹姆斯兄弟差一点
{\fscx70\fscy70}...as being just a rung down
from the James brothers.{\r}

69
00:06:21,997 --> 00:06:24,932
我希望如果我避开那些啄木鸟来见你…
{\fscx70\fscy70}I was hoping if I ran into you
aside from those peckerwoods...{\r}

70
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,161
…我就能向你展示我的特别之处
{\fscx70\fscy70}...I could show you how special I am.{\r}

71
00:06:40,615 --> 00:06:44,608
我坚信我注定要干一番大事业的，詹姆斯先生
{\fscx70\fscy70}I honestly believe I'm destined
for great things, Mr. James.{\r}

72
00:06:44,786 --> 00:06:49,120
我的特别之处一开始并不引人注目
{\fscx70\fscy70}I got qualities that don't come shining
through right at the outset.{\r}

73
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:54,956
给我一个机会，我能把活干好
我向你保证
{\fscx70\fscy70}You give me a chance, I'll get
the job done. I guarantee you that.{\r}

74
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:02,465
嗨，迪克，听说你骗了个印第安女人？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hey, Dick, is it true you diddled a squaw?{\r}

75
00:07:04,706 --> 00:07:08,938
快点，告诉我
我一直想睡一个红皮肤女人
（红皮肤：对印第安人的侮辱称呼）
{\fscx70\fscy70}Come on, you can tell me. I've always
wanted to lay down with a redskin.{\r}

76
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:10,944
这个，查理…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, Charley...{\r}

77
00:07:12,414 --> 00:07:15,850
…你会有这样一种感觉…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...there's a feeling that comes over you...{\r}

78
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:19,680
…这个女人的手割下了一个教士的头皮
而你进入了她的身体…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...getting inside a woman whose hands
has scalped a congregation.{\r}

79
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:22,687
她们的阴道里有雷鸣般的声音…
{\fscx70\fscy70}There's this thunderous sound
that comes from their cooch...{\r}

80
00:07:22,857 --> 00:07:26,122
…因为她们站着生孩子…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...on account of the fact that
they birth a child standing upright...{\r}

81
00:07:26,294 --> 00:07:29,286
- …像野兽那样
- 什么样的声音？
{\fscx70\fscy70}...like a wild animal.
- What's it sound like?{\r}

82
00:07:29,464 --> 00:07:33,730
雷鸣般的阴道是啥样就是啥样，查理
我不知道
{\fscx70\fscy70}Whatever a thunderous cooch sounds like
there, Charley. I don't know.{\r}

83
00:07:34,336 --> 00:07:35,735
不对
{\fscx70\fscy70}No.{\r}

84
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:38,304
她们的阴道很吵，是因为…
{\fscx70\fscy70}They got a noisy quim
on account of the fact that...{\r}

85
00:07:38,473 --> 00:07:43,376
…她们在平原上穿行的时候用它来装杂货
{\fscx70\fscy70}...they use their cunnis as a saddlebag
to carry sundries across the plains.{\r}

86
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:47,442
少来了，到底什么感觉？爽吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Come on, what'd it really feel like?
Did it feel good?{\r}

87
00:07:47,615 --> 00:07:50,015
快点坦白，快
{\fscx70\fscy70}Come on, fess up, now.{\r}

88
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:52,085
我喜欢你，查理
{\fscx70\fscy70}I like you, Charley.{\r}

89
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:55,683
我也喜欢你，查理
{\fscx70\fscy70}I like you too, Charley.{\r}

90
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:57,148
这个…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well...{\r}

91
00:07:59,194 --> 00:08:01,185
你并不特别，福特先生
{\fscx70\fscy70}You're not so special, Mr. Ford.{\r}

92
00:08:02,197 --> 00:08:06,065
你就像其他那些新手一样
自我吹嘘，想得到一显身手的机会
{\fscx70\fscy70}You're just like any other tyro
who's prinked himself up for an escapade.{\r}

93
00:08:06,234 --> 00:08:10,068
希望成为那些江湖小说里面的神枪手
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hoping to be a gunslinger
like them nickel books are about.{\r}

94
00:08:11,072 --> 00:08:13,939
你可以歇歇了…
{\fscx70\fscy70}You may as well quench your mind of it...{\r}

95
00:08:15,176 --> 00:08:18,202
…因为你不是那块料，孩子
{\fscx70\fscy70}...because you don't have
the ingredients, son.{\r}

96
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:35,760
很遗憾，我的话影响了你的判断…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, I'm sorry to hear
you feel that way...{\r}

97
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,127
…让你这么看我
{\fscx70\fscy70}...as I put such stock
in your opinions.{\r}

98
00:08:44,305 --> 00:08:48,401
作为一个枪手
我只有一把古董级的左轮手枪…
{\fscx70\fscy70}As for me being a gunslinger, I've just got
this one granddaddy Paterson Colt...{\r}

99
00:08:48,576 --> 00:08:51,044
…还借了一条皮带来固定它
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and a borrowed belt to stick it in.{\r}

100
00:08:51,212 --> 00:08:54,545
但我也的确有雄心壮志
{\fscx70\fscy70}But I also got an appetite
for greater things.{\r}

101
00:08:57,786 --> 00:09:01,813
我希望借着加入你们的机会
能让自己离目标更近一步
{\fscx70\fscy70}I hoped by joining up with you, it'd put me
that much closer to getting them.{\r}

102
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:07,387
哎，让我怎么说好呢？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, what am I supposed to say to that?{\r}

103
00:09:09,764 --> 00:09:11,459
今晚我当你的拍档
{\fscx70\fscy70}Let me be your sidekick tonight.{\r}

104
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:12,759
拍档？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Sidekick?{\r}

105
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:15,061
这样你能看到我的不足和闪光点
{\fscx70\fscy70}So you can examine my grit
and intelligence.{\r}

106
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:16,931
我不知道你这人到底怎样…
{\fscx70\fscy70}I don't know what it is about you...{\r}

107
00:09:17,105 --> 00:09:20,165
…但你说的越多，就越让我感到不安
{\fscx70\fscy70}...but the more you talk,
the more you give me the willies.{\r}

108
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:24,237
我想我今晚不想看到你，好吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Now, I don't believe I want you anywhere
within earshot this evening, okay?{\r}

109
00:09:24,412 --> 00:09:25,902
明白吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You understand?{\r}

110
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:33,451
- 我很遗憾…
- 你怎么还不走？快点
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Well, I'm sorry...
- Why don't you just get now? Scat.{\r}

111
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:40,719
好吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}All right.{\r}

112
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:47,026
我曾经和一个女孩在一起，她不是印第安人
{\fscx70\fscy70}I was with a girl once, wasn't a squaw.{\r}

113
00:09:47,202 --> 00:09:49,067
但她很漂亮
{\fscx70\fscy70}But she was pretty.{\r}

114
00:09:49,437 --> 00:09:53,806
她金黄的头发就像…
{\fscx70\fscy70}She had yellow hair like a...{\r}

115
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,375
噢，就是像什么东西
{\fscx70\fscy70}Oh, like something.{\r}

116
00:09:57,645 --> 00:10:00,512
像一缕灿烂的阳光？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Like hair bobbed from a ray of sunlight?{\r}

117
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:03,617
对，对，就像那样
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah. Yeah, like that.{\r}

118
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:06,981
哥们，你…你说话真好听
{\fscx70\fscy70}Boy, you... You talk good.{\r}

119
00:10:07,155 --> 00:10:09,817
华丽的词藻能表达感情
{\fscx70\fscy70}You can hide things in vocabulary.{\r}

120
00:10:11,793 --> 00:10:16,355
也许你能帮我给她写个纸条，寄过去？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Maybe you and me could write her a note,
send it by post?{\r}

121
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:18,226
跟你说吧，艾德，你要做的…
{\fscx70\fscy70}See, all you gotta do, Ed...{\r}

122
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,698
…就是琢磨她的心思，然后一举搞定
{\fscx70\fscy70}...is predict her needs
and beat her to the punch.{\r}

123
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:27,637
嗯，这个女孩，她的工作真的很特别
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, this girl, she has a real specific job.{\r}

124
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:30,734
- 特别？
- 我们只在一起过一次
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Specific?
- We was only together once.{\r}

125
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:32,174
她…
{\fscx70\fscy70}She...{\r}

126
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:37,409
她怕闪电，她从马车下面…
{\fscx70\fscy70}She was afraid of lightning,
and she came up under the wagon and...{\r}

127
00:10:37,585 --> 00:10:40,520
…向上抱住了我
{\fscx70\fscy70}...just cuddled right up to me.{\r}

128
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:42,656
她也给了我很优惠的价格
{\fscx70\fscy70}She give me a kind price too.{\r}

129
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:48,719
嗯，的确很特别
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, I'll be. That is specific.{\r}

130
00:10:51,432 --> 00:10:53,730
嗯，当然，她也跟别人在一起过…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah, sure,
she'd been with other people...{\r}

131
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:55,961
…但她对我说的那些话…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...but the kind of things she said to me...{\r}

132
00:10:56,137 --> 00:10:59,265
…显然是真情流露
{\fscx70\fscy70}...people just don't say
unless they really mean it.{\r}

133
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,506
我的爱人说她只会嫁给我
{\fscx70\fscy70}My love said she would marry only me{\r}

134
00:11:03,378 --> 00:11:06,404
即使朱庇特也不能让她动心
（朱庇特：罗马最高神）
{\fscx70\fscy70}And Jove himself could not make her care.{\r}

135
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:09,175
对于女人说给爱人的话，我想你也同意
{\fscx70\fscy70}For what women say to lovers, you'll agree{\r}

136
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,446
就像写在流水里，写在空气里
{\fscx70\fscy70}One writes on running water or on air.{\r}

137
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:18,518
老天，真不错，那我们就这么写给她
{\fscx70\fscy70}My God, that's good.
Let's write her that.{\r}

138
00:11:19,527 --> 00:11:21,154
不行
{\fscx70\fscy70}No.{\r}

139
00:11:21,462 --> 00:11:23,862
跟妓女说这些诗情画意的话没用
{\fscx70\fscy70}Poetry don't work on whores.{\r}

140
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:29,026
你好吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}How do you do?{\r}

141
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:33,532
现在祝你生日快乐是不是太迟了？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Am I too late
to wish you a happy birthday?{\r}

142
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,372
你怎么知道我的生日？
{\fscx70\fscy70}How'd you know?{\r}

143
00:11:37,946 --> 00:11:40,210
你要是知道我对你的了解程度，会很惊讶
{\fscx70\fscy70}You'd be surprised
at what I got stored away.{\r}

144
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:42,975
我是詹姆斯小伙方面的权威
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm an authority on the James boys.{\r}

145
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:44,618
是吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Is you?{\r}

146
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:50,849
嗯…我刚刚和你哥哥弗兰克
友好的交谈了一会儿
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well... Well, your brother Frank and I,
we just had a real nice visit.{\r}

147
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:55,189
就是随便聊聊，在那边
{\fscx70\fscy70}Just chit-chatting about this and that,
right over there.{\r}

148
00:11:55,597 --> 00:11:58,498
大概聊了一百个话题…
{\fscx70\fscy70}And must've been a hundred subjects
entertained...{\r}

149
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,032
老天，你知道这炖汤应该配什么吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Good Lord, you know
what this stew needs?{\r}

150
00:12:05,707 --> 00:12:07,334
饺子？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Dumplings?{\r}

151
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:09,271
面条
{\fscx70\fscy70}Noodles.{\r}

152
00:12:09,644 --> 00:12:13,011
来一碗炖汤面，你一晚上都会回味
{\fscx70\fscy70}You eat yourself some noodle stew
and your clock'll tick all night.{\r}

153
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:17,049
你见过费耶德市的那个女人吗？
她用鼻孔吸面条吃
{\fscx70\fscy70}You ever see that woman up in Fayette?
Suck noodles up her nose.{\r}

154
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,615
- 在费耶德？
- 我想我没见过
{\fscx70\fscy70}- In Fayette?
- I don't believe I have.{\r}

155
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:23,120
你没听说过她，嗯？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You never heard of her, huh?{\r}

156
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:26,621
那里有你想象不到的好事
{\fscx70\fscy70}You got canals up there
you never dreamed of.{\r}

157
00:12:30,798 --> 00:12:32,493
有些话我不喜欢反复说…
{\fscx70\fscy70}I don't like to harp on a subject...{\r}

158
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:35,261
我不关心谁跟我一起做事，从不关心
{\fscx70\fscy70}I don't care who comes with me.
Never have.{\r}

159
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:38,030
所以大家都觉得我很合群
{\fscx70\fscy70}That's why they call me gregarious.{\r}

160
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:42,672
我听说你和这个戴礼帽的小伙子
谈得很不错
{\fscx70\fscy70}I hear you and young Stovepipe here
had a real nice visit.{\r}

161
00:12:43,144 --> 00:12:47,171
你们还有一大片木头要砍呢，小子
{\fscx70\fscy70}Your boys have got about a acre
of lumber to haul, dingus.{\r}

162
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:49,846
你最好赶紧赶他们干活去
{\fscx70\fscy70}You better goose them down yonder.{\r}

163
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:04,293
1867年至1881年间
詹姆斯一伙犯下了超过25起…
{\fscx70\fscy70}The James Gang committed over 25 bank,
train and stagecoach robberies...{\r}

164
00:13:04,465 --> 00:13:07,901
…在银行、火车和公共马车上的抢劫案
{\fscx70\fscy70}...from 1867 to 1881.{\r}

165
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:10,862
但除了弗兰克・詹姆斯和杰西・詹姆斯…
{\fscx70\fscy70}But except for Frank and Jesse James...{\r}

166
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,169
…其余所有初期成员
现在不是已死就是已经入狱
{\fscx70\fscy70}...all the original members
were now either dead or in prison.{\r}

167
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:20,174
我的眼睛、灵魂和我的身体
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Mine eye
All my soul and all my every part{\r}

168
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:23,847
这种罪恶，没有补救方法
{\fscx70\fscy70}And for this sin, there is no remedy{\r}

169
00:13:24,585 --> 00:13:27,349
它已经深入我的心底
{\fscx70\fscy70}It is so grounded inward in my heart.{\r}

170
00:13:27,522 --> 00:13:29,820
所以在蓝切地的最后一次抢劫行动中…
{\fscx70\fscy70}So for their last robbery at Blue Cut...{\r}

171
00:13:29,991 --> 00:13:33,586
…兄弟俩从附近的山林里招募了一些…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...the brothers recruited a gang
of petty thieves and country rubes...{\r}

172
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:36,423
…小贼和乡下人
{\fscx70\fscy70}...culled from the local hillsides.{\r}

173
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,470
准点到达，动手！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Right on schedule, Buck!{\r}

174
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:59,204
灭了那些灯笼！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Snuff those lanterns!{\r}

175
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,180
看看那群傻子，他们肯定会互相绊倒
然后开枪把对方打成女人
{\fscx70\fscy70}Look at those fools. They're gonna trip
and shoot each other into females.{\r}

176
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:06,479
我打赌，他们要是这么做
我可以给他们找几百个女人
{\fscx70\fscy70}I bet you I could find them husbands
if they do.{\r}

177
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:53,083
散开！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Fan out!{\r}

178
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:58,531
别开枪！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hold your fire!{\r}

179
00:17:01,502 --> 00:17:02,730
- 注意他！
- 下去
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Watch him!
- Going down.{\r}

180
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,475
别开枪，你们这些白痴！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hold your fire, you idiots!{\r}

181
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:21,713
别开枪！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hold your fire!{\r}

182
00:17:31,832 --> 00:17:33,561
让我进去
{\fscx70\fscy70}Let me in.{\r}

183
00:17:34,268 --> 00:17:36,133
动手！小伙子们！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Buck! Boys!{\r}

184
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:38,363
动手，这边！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Buck, this way!{\r}

185
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,674
你觉得这锁撑得住吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Do you think that lock will hold?{\r}

186
00:17:43,244 --> 00:17:44,905
不觉得
{\fscx70\fscy70}No, I don't.{\r}

187
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,338
快走，快走
{\fscx70\fscy70}Let's go, let's go.{\r}

188
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,961
你们别装聪明，也别逞强
{\fscx70\fscy70}Let's not get clever, nor courageous,
any of you.{\r}

189
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:18,540
你好啊，小伙子！
这些都是给我的？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hey there, boys!
These are all for me?{\r}

190
00:18:21,382 --> 00:18:23,816
看起来像是圣诞节的早晨
{\fscx70\fscy70}Looks like Christmas morning in here.{\r}

191
00:18:25,653 --> 00:18:27,245
你好，朋友
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hey, friend.{\r}

192
00:18:28,756 --> 00:18:30,747
我四处偷窥一下你不介意吧？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You mind if I have a peek around?{\r}

193
00:18:31,158 --> 00:18:33,388
垃圾，不行
{\fscx70\fscy70}This shit. Nope.{\r}

194
00:18:35,196 --> 00:18:36,493
不行
{\fscx70\fscy70}Nope.{\r}

195
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:39,496
你这里有什么好东西吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You got anything good here?{\r}

196
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:41,801
也许有
{\fscx70\fscy70}It could be.{\r}

197
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:58,518
保险箱打开！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Open that safe.{\r}

198
00:19:03,858 --> 00:19:05,416
快点！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Do it!{\r}

199
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:12,023
- 你没必要砸他头啊
- 不，有必要，要不他们不服
{\fscx70\fscy70}- You didn't have to bop him.
- Yeah, he did. They needed convincing.{\r}

200
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:14,633
他们有他们的规矩，我有我的办法…
{\fscx70\fscy70}They got their company rules,
I got my mean streak...{\r}

201
00:19:14,802 --> 00:19:17,293
…这就是我们干活的方式
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and that's how
we get things done around here.{\r}

202
00:19:18,406 --> 00:19:22,103
- 过来看着他
- 快点，过去
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Get on over here and attend to this thing.
- Come on, go.{\r}

203
00:19:26,247 --> 00:19:29,114
别开枪，一群白痴！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hold your fire, you idiots!{\r}

204
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,381
再往里翻翻
{\fscx70\fscy70}Dig deeper.{\r}

205
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:36,283
快点！给我钱
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Come on!
- Give me your money.{\r}

206
00:19:36,457 --> 00:19:39,392
- 还有你，站起来
- 让我看看你的手
{\fscx70\fscy70}- And you, stand up.
- Let's see your hands.{\r}

207
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,289
你有什么？
{\fscx70\fscy70}What have you got?{\r}

208
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:44,794
说英语
{\fscx70\fscy70}Speak English.{\r}

209
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,501
钱，钱，你听得懂吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Money. Money. You understand that?{\r}

210
00:19:51,072 --> 00:19:52,539
给我钱！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Give me your money!{\r}

211
00:20:01,982 --> 00:20:03,916
有一些收据
{\fscx70\fscy70}There's some receipts.{\r}

212
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:07,519
有一些五块的钞票
{\fscx70\fscy70}I got fives.{\r}

213
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:11,524
杰西，杰西
{\fscx70\fscy70}Jesse. Jesse.{\r}

214
00:20:14,995 --> 00:20:16,826
看起来没啥东西
{\fscx70\fscy70}Don't look good.{\r}

215
00:20:22,136 --> 00:20:25,435
这里没有十万美金，迪克
{\fscx70\fscy70}There ain't no 100,000 dollars
in here, Dick.{\r}

216
00:20:34,315 --> 00:20:35,873
跪下
{\fscx70\fscy70}Get down on your knees.{\r}

217
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:38,608
为什么？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Why?{\r}

218
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:40,344
噢，你得开始祈祷了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, you ought to pray.{\r}

219
00:20:41,689 --> 00:20:42,713
因为我要杀了你
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm gonna kill you.{\r}

220
00:20:49,396 --> 00:20:51,159
跪下！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Get at!{\r}

221
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:55,799
那你得强迫我了
{\fscx70\fscy70}You're gonna have to make me.{\r}

222
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,700
好吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}All right.{\r}

223
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:30,397
别杀他！不要，别杀他
{\fscx70\fscy70}Don't shoot him! No, don't shoot him.{\r}

224
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:45,313
轮不到你指挥我，艾德
{\fscx70\fscy70}Don't tell me what I can
and cannot do, Ed.{\r}

225
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,124
集合！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Round them up!{\r}

226
00:22:14,215 --> 00:22:18,015
芝加哥报业在蓝切地的火车抢劫案上大做文章…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Chicago newspaper publishers made
a great deal of the Blue Cut train robbery...{\r}

227
00:22:18,185 --> 00:22:20,176
…声称除了密苏里之外，没有一个州…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...alleging that in no state
but Missouri...{\r}

228
00:22:20,354 --> 00:22:23,846
…会纵容詹姆斯兄弟达12年之久
{\fscx70\fscy70}...would the James brothers be tolerated
for 12 years.{\r}

229
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:25,857
嗨
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hey.{\r}

230
00:22:27,294 --> 00:22:29,626
你嘴巴紧吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Can you keep a secret?{\r}

231
00:22:30,764 --> 00:22:33,392
那要看你告诉我什么了
{\fscx70\fscy70}It depends on what you're concealing.{\r}

232
00:22:34,735 --> 00:22:36,896
你害怕黑暗吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You afraid of the dark?{\r}

233
00:22:37,771 --> 00:22:39,295
不
{\fscx70\fscy70}No.{\r}

234
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,867
你迷信吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You superstitious?{\r}

235
00:22:44,211 --> 00:22:49,274
我放了…我放了一颗橡子在窗户上
来躲避闪电
{\fscx70\fscy70}I put... I put an acorn in the window
to keep the lightning out.{\r}

236
00:23:37,765 --> 00:23:42,429
孩子，你走路跟猫一样没声音
{\fscx70\fscy70}Kid, you must've crept up on cat's paws.{\r}

237
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,806
我打赌，这是你第一次，也是最后一次
被人突袭的机会
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'll wager that's the first and last time
you'll ever be caught off-guard.{\r}

238
00:23:50,077 --> 00:23:51,101
你几岁了？
{\fscx70\fscy70}How old are you?{\r}

239
00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:53,979
二十
{\fscx70\fscy70}Twenty.{\r}

240
00:23:56,684 --> 00:24:00,347
不过，我想，要到一月份…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Except, well, I guess I won't
really be 20 till...{\r}

241
00:24:00,854 --> 00:24:03,015
我才20岁，所以…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Till January, so...{\r}

242
00:24:03,857 --> 00:24:05,722
我19岁
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm 19.{\r}

243
00:24:08,128 --> 00:24:11,291
嗯，不过你是不是觉得自己
比实际年龄要老？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah, you feel older than that, though,
don't you?{\r}

244
00:24:16,003 --> 00:24:17,868
是的，会觉得
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah, I do.{\r}

245
00:24:30,851 --> 00:24:35,151
嗨，弗兰克，你…你看
警方会不会已经出动了？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hey, Frank, you...
You think the sheriff's out already?{\r}

246
00:24:36,757 --> 00:24:39,920
- 相当有可能
- 是啊
{\fscx70\fscy70}- More than likely.
- Yeah.{\r}

247
00:24:42,863 --> 00:24:44,660
今晚很顺利
{\fscx70\fscy70}I had a real fine time tonight.{\r}

248
00:24:44,832 --> 00:24:48,063
- 是吗？
- 嗯，是的
{\fscx70\fscy70}- You think so?
- Yup. Yeah.{\r}

249
00:24:48,235 --> 00:24:51,398
嗨，我不只是在吹嘘我和我弟弟
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hey, I wasn't just flapping my lips
about my kid brother and me.{\r}

250
00:24:51,772 --> 00:24:56,334
我想说的是，如果你和杰西
能看清我们的胆识和勇气…
{\fscx70\fscy70}What I figured was if you and Jesse could
gauge our courage and our daring...{\r}

251
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,774
…你就该把我们收做固定搭档
{\fscx70\fscy70}...you might just make us
your regular sidekicks.{\r}

252
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:01,176
你们的勇气和胆识
{\fscx70\fscy70}Your courage and your daring.{\r}

253
00:25:02,449 --> 00:25:07,512
关于搭档我听得够多了
你这口气跟你那该死的弟弟一样
{\fscx70\fscy70}I about heard all I want to about sidekicks.
You sound like your damn brother.{\r}

254
00:25:07,688 --> 00:25:12,182
哦，跟你直说吧
是我弟弟让我来跟你说这些的，他…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah. Well, I'll be square with you,
it's Bob who put me up to it. He's...{\r}

255
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,059
他有本事加入詹姆斯兄弟的队伍
但我却完全做不好
{\fscx70\fscy70}He's got plans for the James boys
I can't even get the hang of.{\r}

256
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,027
- 这活太复杂了
- 是吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}- They're that complicated.
- Yeah?{\r}

257
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:21,761
嗯，你们可以打消这个念头了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, you can just
get shed of that idea.{\r}

258
00:25:21,935 --> 00:25:24,460
因为今晚之后，我们就要金盆洗手了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Because after tonight,
there'll be no more shenanigans.{\r}

259
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:27,972
你可以在日记上记下来
{\fscx70\fscy70}You can jot that down in your little diary.{\r}

260
00:25:28,142 --> 00:25:32,909
1881年9月7日，詹姆斯一伙
在蓝切地抢劫了最后一辆火车…
{\fscx70\fscy70}September 7th, 1881, the James Gang
robbed one last train at Blue Cut...{\r}

261
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,571
…从此弃恶从善
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and gave up their nightriding for good.{\r}

262
00:25:42,222 --> 00:25:43,712
等等
{\fscx70\fscy70}Wait.{\r}

263
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:47,850
那么，你以后准备靠什么吃饭？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, how are you gonna
make your living?{\r}

264
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,200
也许我会去卖鞋
{\fscx70\fscy70}Maybe I'll sell shoes.{\r}

265
00:26:05,012 --> 00:26:07,105
真不敢想象，早上起来…
{\fscx70\fscy70}I can't believe I woke up this morning...{\r}

266
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:10,580
…我还在想父亲是否会借我大衣穿…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...wondering if my daddy
would loan me his overcoat...{\r}

267
00:26:10,751 --> 00:26:12,616
…而现在才过午夜…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and here it is just past midnight...{\r}

268
00:26:12,786 --> 00:26:16,347
…我已经抢了一列火车，坐在摇椅上…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...l've already robbed a railroad train
and I'm sitting in a rocking chair...{\r}

269
00:26:16,523 --> 00:26:18,753
…和独一无二的杰西・詹姆斯聊天了
{\fscx70\fscy70}...chatting with none other
than Jesse James.{\r}

270
00:26:19,493 --> 00:26:22,121
是啊，世界真奇妙
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah, it's a wonderful world.{\r}

271
00:26:30,537 --> 00:26:32,368
这是什么？
{\fscx70\fscy70}What's this?{\r}

272
00:26:32,573 --> 00:26:34,268
哦，对了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Oh, yeah.{\r}

273
00:26:35,442 --> 00:26:39,503
今天早上我真的很激动
我在想是否能认出你或者弗兰克…
{\fscx70\fscy70}I was real agitated this morning, so I was
wondering if I would know you or Frank...{\r}

274
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,811
…分清楚你俩谁是谁
所以我带了这块描述你们的剪报
{\fscx70\fscy70}...tell you all apart, and so I had
this clipping that described you both.{\r}

275
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:47,048
想听听吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Want me to read it?{\r}

276
00:26:47,654 --> 00:26:48,814
念吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}Go on.{\r}

277
00:26:48,989 --> 00:26:53,085
嗯…我找一下，等等
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well... I gotta find it. Hold on.{\r}

278
00:26:53,994 --> 00:26:56,224
在这里，找到了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Here. Here.{\r}

279
00:26:56,396 --> 00:27:00,526
“杰西・詹姆斯，家里最小的孩子
一张脸像小姑娘一样，光滑又无辜
{\fscx70\fscy70}"Jesse James, the youngest, has a face
as smooth and innocent as a schoolgirl.{\r}

280
00:27:00,701 --> 00:27:05,070
蓝色的眼睛清澈而又明锐
而且总是十分警觉
{\fscx70\fscy70}The blue eyes, very clear and penetrating,
are never at rest.{\r}

281
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:08,731
他外表高大，举止得体，善于忍耐…
{\fscx70\fscy70}His form is tall and graceful
and capable of great endurance...{\r}

282
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:10,342
…和进取
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and great effort.{\r}

283
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:14,504
杰西快乐而鲁莽，随遇而安
{\fscx70\fscy70}Jesse is lighthearted, reckless,
and devil-may-care.{\r}

284
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:18,916
- 他嘴上总是挂着一丝微笑…”
- 够了，够了，够了
{\fscx70\fscy70}- There's always a smile on his lips..."
- All right, all right, all right.{\r}

285
00:27:19,086 --> 00:27:22,886
嗯，然后是…弗兰克，弗兰克，弗兰克
然后没了，然后…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, yeah, then it just... Frank, Frank,
Frank. That's nothing. And then...{\r}

286
00:27:35,335 --> 00:27:37,200
你知道我床边放着什么吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You know what I got
right next to my bed?{\r}

287
00:27:37,838 --> 00:27:42,901
是《火车劫匪》，或者是R・W・史蒂文斯写的
《詹姆斯家小伙子的故事》
{\fscx70\fscy70}Is The Train Robbers, or, A Story
of the James Boys by R.W. Stevens.{\r}

288
00:27:43,076 --> 00:27:46,011
我是说，多少个夜里
在空无一人的图书馆…
{\fscx70\fscy70}I mean, many's the night I stayed up...{\r}

289
00:27:46,446 --> 00:27:48,607
…我两眼通红，张着嘴巴…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...with my eyes open
and my mouth open...{\r}

290
00:27:48,782 --> 00:27:51,945
…读着你们的故事
{\fscx70\fscy70}...just reading about your escapades
in the Wide Awake Library.{\r}

291
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:55,782
那些都是扯蛋，你应该知道
{\fscx70\fscy70}They're all lies, you know.{\r}

292
00:27:59,192 --> 00:28:01,160
是，当然是
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah, of course they are.{\r}

293
00:28:04,431 --> 00:28:07,628
如果觉得难受就没必要一直抽烟
{\fscx70\fscy70}You don't have to keep smoking that
if it's making you bungey.{\r}

294
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:37,724
亚历山大・富兰克林・詹姆斯
听说杰西・詹姆斯被暗杀的时候…
…应该人在巴尔的摩市
{\fscx70\fscy70}Alexander Franklin James
would be in Baltimore...{\r}
...when he would read of
the assassination of Jesse James.

295
00:28:51,178 --> 00:28:55,774
因为他觉得弟弟性情古怪，喜怒无常
所以离开了他
{\fscx70\fscy70}He had spurned his younger brother
for being peculiar and temperamental.{\r}

296
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:00,415
但如果感觉到自己再也不会见到杰西…
{\fscx70\fscy70}But once he perceived
that he would never see Jesse again...{\r}

297
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:05,651
…弗兰克应该会感到
着急，丧气，不知所措
{\fscx70\fscy70}...Frank would be wrought-up,
perplexed, despondent.{\r}

298
00:29:44,364 --> 00:29:47,629
我哥哥已经不和我谈那档子事了
{\fscx70\fscy70}My brother and me are hardly
on speaking terms these days.{\r}

299
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:51,300
嗯，我也没打算说
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, I wasn't gonna mention it.{\r}

300
00:30:01,848 --> 00:30:03,281
你怕了吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Are you scared?{\r}

301
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:06,211
没有，只是有点惊讶
{\fscx70\fscy70}No, I'm just surprised a little.{\r}

302
00:30:06,386 --> 00:30:08,946
它的肉不是我喜欢的那种多汁的
{\fscx70\fscy70}They ain't as succulent as I like,
the devil to clean...{\r}

303
00:30:09,122 --> 00:30:12,182
…但如果剥了皮，用大蒜和油来烤…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...but if a man skins them
and fries them in garlic and oil...{\r}

304
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:15,226
…老天，那是相当好吃
{\fscx70\fscy70}...mercy, them's good eating.{\r}

305
00:30:15,395 --> 00:30:18,728
这个，我还没饿到那个地步
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, I never been that hungry.{\r}

306
00:30:21,468 --> 00:30:23,561
我给它们取了名字
{\fscx70\fscy70}I give them names.{\r}

307
00:30:25,005 --> 00:30:26,404
比如说？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Such as?{\r}

308
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:31,600
比如敌人
{\fscx70\fscy70}Such as enemies.{\r}

309
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:35,343
我给它们取了敌人的名字
{\fscx70\fscy70}I give them names of enemies.{\r}

310
00:30:48,095 --> 00:30:51,155
告诉伍德和查理准备好行李
{\fscx70\fscy70}Go tell Wood and Charley
to get their gatherings together.{\r}

311
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:54,157
好的
{\fscx70\fscy70}All right.{\r}

312
00:30:55,569 --> 00:30:57,127
我也是吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Me too?{\r}

313
00:30:59,272 --> 00:31:01,240
你可以留下
{\fscx70\fscy70}You can stay.{\r}

314
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:05,235
好吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}All right.{\r}

315
00:31:11,852 --> 00:31:13,149
嗨
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hey.{\r}

316
00:31:15,388 --> 00:31:18,084
- 你想要什么，啄木鸟？
- 没什么
{\fscx70\fscy70}- What do you want, peckerwood?
- Nothing.{\r}

317
00:31:18,258 --> 00:31:20,886
只是杰西让我叫你俩收拾好东西…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Except to say Jesse wants
you two to gather your parts...{\r}

318
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:23,586
…然后上马离开镇子
{\fscx70\fscy70}...get on your horses
and get out of town.{\r}

319
00:31:23,897 --> 00:31:25,888
而我留下来
{\fscx70\fscy70}And me to stick around.{\r}

320
00:31:28,235 --> 00:31:31,329
喔，我可是他的表弟…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, whoa, I'm his cousin...{\r}

321
00:31:31,505 --> 00:31:33,234
…我告诉你
{\fscx70\fscy70}...l'll have you know.{\r}

322
00:31:33,406 --> 00:31:35,567
我妈妈是他爸爸的妹妹
{\fscx70\fscy70}My mama's his daddy's sister.{\r}

323
00:31:35,942 --> 00:31:38,172
他们就是这么告诉你的，伍德？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Is that how they described it to you,
Wood?{\r}

324
00:31:39,846 --> 00:31:41,973
你说话最好注意点，小样
{\fscx70\fscy70}You better watch your tongue,
young sapling.{\r}

325
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:45,516
凭什么就该是我出去而不是你，小兔崽子？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Why is it me who's gotta rattle his hocks
out of town and not you, Bunny?{\r}

326
00:31:45,685 --> 00:31:47,414
别激动，要我说…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Put your horns away.
If I know Jess...{\r}

327
00:31:47,587 --> 00:31:50,818
…一定是有一些又脏又累的活…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...there's some real nasty
sad-suzie work's gotta be done...{\r}

328
00:31:51,224 --> 00:31:54,091
…等着鲍勃这个呆子去干
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and Bob's the ninny that has to do it.{\r}

329
00:31:54,261 --> 00:31:56,525
哦，是啊，肯定是这样，查理
{\fscx70\fscy70}Oh, yeah, I'm sure that's it, Charley.{\r}

330
00:31:58,265 --> 00:32:02,964
你12个小时前才认识他
他甚至连你的名字都不知道
{\fscx70\fscy70}You only met him 12 hours ago.
He doesn't even know your name.{\r}

331
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:07,462
伍德！告诉你爸
我十月份会在肯塔基州
{\fscx70\fscy70}Wood! You tell your daddy
I'll be in Kentucky in October.{\r}

332
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:11,241
我们可以一起去打鸟
{\fscx70\fscy70}We can hunt some birds together.{\r}

333
00:32:11,778 --> 00:32:13,211
好吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}All right.{\r}

334
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,472
那为什么是鲍勃留下来了？
{\fscx70\fscy70}So how come it's Bob who gets to stay?{\r}

335
00:32:20,053 --> 00:32:23,045
鲍勃要把我的马具搬到
这条街前面的一座房子里去
{\fscx70\fscy70}Bob's gonna move my gear to a house
down the street.{\r}

336
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,114
看到没？
{\fscx70\fscy70}See?{\r}

337
00:32:25,892 --> 00:32:28,417
- 我无所谓
- 嗯，好吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}- I don't mind.
- Yeah, well.{\r}

338
00:32:28,595 --> 00:32:30,688
听起来像是冒险行动
{\fscx70\fscy70}Sounds like an adventure.{\r}

339
00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:38,399
他们在夜间搬到了杜鲁斯特大道1017号…
{\fscx70\fscy70}They moved to 1017 Troost Avenue
at night...{\r}

340
00:32:38,572 --> 00:32:43,009
…这样他们的邻居就不能看清他们
或是他们带来的东西
{\fscx70\fscy70}...so that the neighborhood couldn't get
a good look at them or their belongings.{\r}

341
00:32:44,711 --> 00:32:47,407
之后鲍勃以为杰西会让他睡八个小时…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Then Bob thought Jesse
would give him eight hours' sleep...{\r}

342
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:49,947
…然后一大早让他走
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and a daydreaming goodbye.{\r}

343
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,979
但在托马斯・霍华德的房子里
住了两天之后…
{\fscx70\fscy70}But with a second day
in the Thomas Howard house...{\r}

344
00:32:56,156 --> 00:32:58,147
…鲍勃觉得也许他永远都不会离开了…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...Bob thought he might never go...{\r}

345
00:32:59,025 --> 00:33:02,825
…也许他会成为小男孩的好脾气表哥…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...but might be brought in
as a good-natured cousin to the boy...{\r}

346
00:33:04,264 --> 00:33:07,028
…还有芝的好帮手
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and a gentleman helper to Zee.{\r}

347
00:33:10,036 --> 00:33:11,799
杰西到哪里他都跟着
{\fscx70\fscy70}He went everywhere with Jesse.{\r}

348
00:33:11,972 --> 00:33:14,236
他们去了托皮卡交易所酒吧…
{\fscx70\fscy70}They made trips
to the Topeka Exchange Saloon...{\r}

349
00:33:14,407 --> 00:33:18,207
…在那里杰西会花上60分钟
细品一杯啤酒…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...where Jesse could spend nearly
60 minutes sipping one glass of beer...{\r}

350
00:33:18,378 --> 00:33:21,609
…并仍然抱怨感到醉意
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and still complain about feeling tipsy.{\r}

351
00:33:22,282 --> 00:33:25,274
交谈时，鲍勃几乎不发表自己的看法
{\fscx70\fscy70}Bob would rarely vouchsafe his opinions
as they talked.{\r}

352
00:33:25,452 --> 00:33:28,979
如果被问到，他通常会不安和微笑
{\fscx70\fscy70}If spoken to, he would fidget and grin.{\r}

353
00:33:29,723 --> 00:33:33,784
如果杰西在和别人商谈
鲍勃会在一旁仔细观察他们的对话…
{\fscx70\fscy70}If Jesse palavered with another person,
Bob secretaried their dialogue...{\r}

354
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,726
…注意他声调的变化，每个手势
以及面部肌肉的抽搐…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...getting each inflection,
reading every gesture and tic...{\r}

355
00:33:37,898 --> 00:33:41,095
…好像是在为一个逃犯撰写传记…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...as if he wanted to compose
a biography of the outlaw...{\r}

356
00:33:41,268 --> 00:33:44,203
…又好像只在为模仿他做准备
{\fscx70\fscy70}...or as if he were preparing
an impersonation.{\r}

357
00:34:00,053 --> 00:34:01,987
走开
{\fscx70\fscy70}Go away.{\r}

358
00:34:04,824 --> 00:34:08,555
过去没人能悄悄靠近杰西・詹姆斯
{\fscx70\fscy70}Used to be couldn't no one sneak up
on Jesse James.{\r}

359
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:12,262
你觉得现在呢？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Now you think otherwise?{\r}

360
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:16,530
我也从没见过你不带枪
{\fscx70\fscy70}I ain't never seen you without your guns,
neither.{\r}

361
00:34:29,783 --> 00:34:32,115
我想不通
{\fscx70\fscy70}I can't figure it out.{\r}

362
00:34:33,019 --> 00:34:35,180
你是想变得像我…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Do you wanna be like me...{\r}

363
00:34:35,622 --> 00:34:37,112
…还是想取代我？
{\fscx70\fscy70}...or do you wanna be me?{\r}

364
00:34:43,029 --> 00:34:45,293
我只是开玩笑，没别的意思
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm just making fun, is all.{\r}

365
00:34:47,934 --> 00:34:51,199
第二天鲍勃就被热忱的送走了…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Bob was sent away cordially
the next day...{\r}

366
00:34:51,371 --> 00:34:52,861
…杰西向他告了别…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...with a goodbye from Jesse...{\r}

367
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,975
…但芝却没有礼节性的同他告别
{\fscx70\fscy70}...but nothing from Zee
beyond what good manners demanded.{\r}

368
00:35:00,547 --> 00:35:03,380
从堪萨斯市到他姐姐的农场有40里地
{\fscx70\fscy70}It was 40 miles to his sister's farm
from Kansas City.{\r}

369
00:35:04,684 --> 00:35:08,984
他到那儿时已经接近傍晚了
{\fscx70\fscy70}And it was well into the afternoon
by the time he arrived there.{\r}

370
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:14,017
玛莎・博尔顿太太在1897年成为寡妇之后…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Mrs. Martha Bolton rented
the Harbison farm in 1879...{\r}

371
00:35:14,194 --> 00:35:16,754
…就出租了她的哈比森农场
{\fscx70\fscy70}...just after becoming a widow.{\r}

372
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,960
靠着出租房间和提供饮食，她收入颇丰
{\fscx70\fscy70}And she made a good income
by giving rooms and meals...{\r}

373
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:25,298
…住户包括他的弟弟查理，威尔伯和鲍勃
还有詹姆斯一伙…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...to her brothers Charley, Wilbur and Bob,
and to members of the James Gang...{\r}

374
00:35:25,472 --> 00:35:27,963
…他们在需要躲避风头的时候就会来这里
{\fscx70\fscy70}...who would appear
whenever they needed seclusion.{\r}

375
00:35:28,141 --> 00:35:29,836
迪克！你会把她弄出毛病的！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Dick! You're gonna make her sick!{\r}

376
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,979
你要是不小心她会吐的！
{\fscx70\fscy70}She's gonna upchuck
if you don't watch out!{\r}

377
00:35:33,546 --> 00:35:36,743
伍德・海特追求玛莎被拒绝…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Wood Hite had been spurned by Martha
in his affections...{\r}

378
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:39,612
…而他转而追求她女儿的企图…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and his attempt to switch his pursuit
to her daughter...{\r}

379
00:35:39,786 --> 00:35:41,686
…也因迪克・利都而遭到挫败
{\fscx70\fscy70}...was being thwarted by Dick Liddil.{\r}

380
00:35:41,855 --> 00:35:45,154
等等，你得向我保证你没那么难缠
{\fscx70\fscy70}Wait a second, you assured me
that you were not ticklish.{\r}

381
00:35:45,325 --> 00:35:46,349
你好！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Howdy!{\r}

382
00:35:46,526 --> 00:35:48,357
这是怎么回事？怎么回事…？
{\fscx70\fscy70}What's going on, now?
What's going on...?{\r}

383
00:35:48,528 --> 00:35:51,361
- 你好！
- 你是在撒谎吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Howdy!
- Were you fibbing about that?{\r}

384
00:35:51,531 --> 00:35:53,328
- 不是
- 完全不是
{\fscx70\fscy70}- No.
- Not at all.{\r}

385
00:35:54,868 --> 00:35:56,563
你不该偷看的，迪克
{\fscx70\fscy70}You're not supposed to peek, Dick.{\r}

386
00:35:56,736 --> 00:35:59,170
是啊，不过你这么漂亮
我真的无法把持
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, you're just so pretty
I can't help myself.{\r}

387
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:01,830
- 这事你得警告他
- 你们好
{\fscx70\fscy70}- You need to be warning him about that.
- Howdy.{\r}

388
00:36:02,008 --> 00:36:05,944
应该关心的是地里的庄稼
也应该关心关心工作…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Worry about the field instead,
might be able to worry about the work...{\r}

389
00:36:06,112 --> 00:36:07,977
你们好！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Howdy!{\r}

390
00:36:08,748 --> 00:36:11,717
- 终于到家了
- 我很高兴，鲍勃
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Finally home.
- I'm so glad, Bob.{\r}

391
00:36:11,885 --> 00:36:14,547
我也住那个房间，鲍勃
别把我的东西弄乱了
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm in that room too, Bob.
Don't mess with my things.{\r}

392
00:36:14,721 --> 00:36:16,746
好的，爷爷
{\fscx70\fscy70}All right, Grandpa.{\r}

393
00:36:22,562 --> 00:36:28,159
“7月9日
勤奋，机智，强烈的责任感…
{\fscx70\fscy70}"July 9th. Diligence, tact,
and a keen sense of responsibility...{\r}

394
00:36:28,334 --> 00:36:32,737
…细致入微，这些都是你的强项
你很敬业”
{\fscx70\fscy70}...capacity for detail are your dominant
traits. Your sense of duty's strong."{\r}

395
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,677
你在这多久了？
{\fscx70\fscy70}How long you been there?{\r}

396
00:37:18,852 --> 00:37:21,753
刚来，错过了很多好看的东西吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Just now arrived. Did I miss much?{\r}

397
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:26,926
如果你从没见过一个肮脏的男人洗澡
那么是的
{\fscx70\fscy70}Not unless you never seen a man
wash his dirty carcass before.{\r}

398
00:37:27,193 --> 00:37:30,594
小伙子，你个子不大，嘴巴倒挺能说
{\fscx70\fscy70}Boy, you got a big old pecker
for being such a little squirrel.{\r}

399
00:37:30,763 --> 00:37:32,754
你来这里看什么，迪克？
{\fscx70\fscy70}That what you come here to see, Dick?{\r}

400
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:36,134
没什么
{\fscx70\fscy70}No.{\r}

401
00:37:37,103 --> 00:37:40,504
你哥哥说杰西在堪萨斯城多留了你几天
{\fscx70\fscy70}Your brother said that Jesse
kept you in Kansas City some extra days.{\r}

402
00:37:40,673 --> 00:37:41,731
为什么？
{\fscx70\fscy70}What was the reason?{\r}

403
00:37:43,943 --> 00:37:47,845
这个，我恐怕不方便细说
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, I'm not at liberty to say exactly.{\r}

404
00:37:48,248 --> 00:37:53,777
那我这么问你吧
杰西有提到我和康明斯在一起谋事吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Let me ask you this. Did Jesse mention
that me and Cummins were in cahoots?{\r}

405
00:37:54,954 --> 00:37:56,114
有这回事？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Is that so?{\r}

406
00:37:56,289 --> 00:38:00,225
哦，亲爱的，我说漏嘴了，是吧？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Oh, dear. I went on and said too much,
have I?{\r}

407
00:38:00,593 --> 00:38:02,652
那么，还有谁跟你们一伙的？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, who else is partners with you two?{\r}

408
00:38:05,031 --> 00:38:09,525
听着，要是被他知道，他会割断我们的喉咙
你不像我这么了解他
{\fscx70\fscy70}See, he'll cut our throats if he finds out.
You don't know him like I do.{\r}

409
00:38:09,702 --> 00:38:13,695
谁要是跟着杰西干那些见不得人的事
然后又背着他密谋别的勾当…
{\fscx70\fscy70}You do Jesse dirt,
you connive behind his back...{\r}

410
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:16,671
…孩子，会被他带着镰刀追杀的
{\fscx70\fscy70}...boy, he'll come after you
with a cleaver.{\r}

411
00:38:19,379 --> 00:38:21,870
那你们俩在密谋什么呢？
{\fscx70\fscy70}So, what are you two cahoots
cooking up?{\r}

412
00:38:24,884 --> 00:38:26,511
不知道我该说不该说
{\fscx70\fscy70}Don't know that I should say.{\r}

413
00:38:27,687 --> 00:38:29,780
我可不会花言巧语
骗你说出你那肮脏的小秘密
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm not gonna wheedle
the dang news from you.{\r}

414
00:38:29,956 --> 00:38:31,719
不如我们让它成为一个谜…
{\fscx70\fscy70}How about we'll leave it a mystery...{\r}

415
00:38:31,991 --> 00:38:36,189
…这样我们都不会为这次谈话后悔？
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and then we won't neither one of us
regret our little chat?{\r}

416
00:38:41,901 --> 00:38:44,665
能把那把转轮枪给我看看吗，鲍勃？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Can you hand me that six-gun there, Bob?{\r}

417
00:38:53,746 --> 00:38:57,876
如果你胆敢跟杰西提起我的事…
{\fscx70\fscy70}If you so much as mention my name
to Jesse...{\r}

418
00:38:58,051 --> 00:39:00,383
…孩子，我会知道的
{\fscx70\fscy70}...boy, I'll find out about it.{\r}

419
00:39:00,553 --> 00:39:03,545
你最好相信我
{\fscx70\fscy70}You had better believe that.{\r}

420
00:39:03,723 --> 00:39:05,748
然后我会找到你
{\fscx70\fscy70}And I'll look you up.{\r}

421
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:10,828
敲开你的门，暴跳如雷
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'll knock on your door,
and I will be as mad as a hornet.{\r}

422
00:39:11,564 --> 00:39:13,725
我会毫不留情
{\fscx70\fscy70}I will be hot.{\r}

423
00:39:15,635 --> 00:39:18,399
注意点手上的家伙，迪克
{\fscx70\fscy70}You be careful with that iron, Dick.{\r}

424
00:39:26,713 --> 00:39:30,308
你知道我在这些问题上的立场
事情就这么简单
{\fscx70\fscy70}You know where I stand on these matters
and that's all there is to it.{\r}

425
00:39:30,483 --> 00:39:34,078
我们从此以后还是亲密无间
{\fscx70\fscy70}Me and you can be as friendly as pigs
from now on.{\r}

426
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:03,037
我是兔崽子・福特，把手举起来！
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm Bunny Ford, stick your hands
up in the air!{\r}

427
00:40:03,216 --> 00:40:04,911
先生
{\fscx70\fscy70}Mister.{\r}

428
00:40:10,189 --> 00:40:12,419
噢，你们胆子还不小啊
{\fscx70\fscy70}Oh, you have some nerve.{\r}

429
00:40:13,726 --> 00:40:19,130
我们刚在看
詹姆斯小伙子们和墨西哥人的故事
{\fscx70\fscy70}We were just reading about the James boys
among the Mexicans.{\r}

430
00:40:20,867 --> 00:40:23,529
这是谁？这不是杰西
{\fscx70\fscy70}What's this? This ain't Jesse.{\r}

431
00:40:23,703 --> 00:40:26,831
- 你怎么知道
- 他不可能没有胡子
{\fscx70\fscy70}- You don't know that.
- He would've never wore no mustache.{\r}

432
00:40:27,006 --> 00:40:29,372
他也不可能摸过大炮
{\fscx70\fscy70}Never was anywheres near a cannon.{\r}

433
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:31,976
让我看看这张
{\fscx70\fscy70}Let me see that picture.{\r}

434
00:40:32,145 --> 00:40:34,875
孩子，我真不知道我在看什么
{\fscx70\fscy70}Boy, I can't even calculate
what I'm looking at.{\r}

435
00:40:35,114 --> 00:40:37,241
- 给我
- 他从小时候起…
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Give me that.
- Ever since he was a child...{\r}

436
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:40,614
…就开始收集
任何和詹姆斯兄弟有关的东西
{\fscx70\fscy70}...Bob's collected whatsoever he could find
about the James brothers.{\r}

437
00:40:40,787 --> 00:40:42,982
是啊，在房间里都搞了一个小博物馆
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah, got himself a little museum
in his room.{\r}

438
00:40:43,156 --> 00:40:46,751
下次你再来偷看，最好随身带把枪防身！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Next time you come snooping around,
you better strap on a shooting iron!{\r}

439
00:40:47,293 --> 00:40:49,784
喔，看我多害怕
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, you can see how scared I am.{\r}

440
00:40:49,962 --> 00:40:53,830
你也是，伍德・海特
再惹我，就一枪崩了你！
{\fscx70\fscy70}You too, Wood Hite. Cross me again,
I'll put a bullet through your head!{\r}

441
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:56,028
孩子，你…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Boy, you...{\r}

442
00:40:56,703 --> 00:40:59,365
小子，你最好想想我表哥是谁…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Son, you better recollect
who my cousin is...{\r}

443
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:03,600
…你也许忘了
杰西就像珍惜圣经一样疼我
{\fscx70\fscy70}...because you've seemed to misremembered
that Jesse loves me like the Good Book.{\r}

444
00:41:03,776 --> 00:41:07,405
现在，你可以装成一个
杂货店里的危险人物…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Now, you may play it like you're
a dangerous person in the grocery store...{\r}

445
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,980
…但别忘了，如果你伤害了我的感情…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...but don't misremember
who you be accounting to...{\r}

446
00:41:10,149 --> 00:41:12,583
…你将面对的是谁
- 我才不管！
{\fscx70\fscy70}...if I so much get my feelings hurt.
- I don't care!{\r}

447
00:41:12,752 --> 00:41:14,310
是不是要我喊，“嘿哟”
{\fscx70\fscy70}Do I have to yell "suwee"?{\r}

448
00:41:14,487 --> 00:41:16,455
我们为何不先和好一阵子呢？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Why don't we make up,
be pleasant for once?{\r}

449
00:41:16,622 --> 00:41:19,455
快快乐乐的度过这个晚上，不好么？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Why don't we pass the evening
like pleasant human beings?{\r}

450
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:21,889
衣服不错，牛仔
{\fscx70\fscy70}I like your nickel suit, cowboy.{\r}

451
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,483
看到什么了吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You see something?{\r}

452
00:41:50,723 --> 00:41:52,520
一只鸟而已
{\fscx70\fscy70}Just a bird.{\r}

453
00:41:56,295 --> 00:41:58,195
十月到来了…
{\fscx70\fscy70}The month of October came...{\r}

454
00:41:58,364 --> 00:42:01,800
…杰西开始发现
私家侦探装扮成售货员…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and Jesse began seeing
Pinkerton operatives in every floor walker...{\r}

455
00:42:01,968 --> 00:42:06,371
…扫路工和普通人在一家店里打探消息
{\fscx70\fscy70}...street sweeper, and common man
poking about in a store.{\r}

456
00:42:08,641 --> 00:42:11,166
11号的早晨，他叫醒妻子…
{\fscx70\fscy70}On the morning of the 11 th,
he would wake his wife...{\r}

457
00:42:11,344 --> 00:42:15,542
…就像圣经里，圣家逃往埃及一样
{\fscx70\fscy70}...with the Scripture pertaining to
the Holy Family's flight into Egypt.{\r}

458
00:42:19,285 --> 00:42:24,188
一夜间，托马斯・霍华德一家
就从堪萨斯市消失了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Overnight, the Thomas Howard clan
vanished from Kansas City.{\r}

459
00:42:34,667 --> 00:42:37,329
之后不久，蓝切地劫车案中的四个人…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Shortly thereafter,
four of the Blue Cut train robbers...{\r}

460
00:42:37,503 --> 00:42:40,336
…在格兰代尔附近的一间木屋里被捕
{\fscx70\fscy70}...were arrested in shacks near Glendale.{\r}

461
00:42:45,378 --> 00:42:49,075
杰西是如何预先知道的，至今还是个迷
{\fscx70\fscy70}How Jesse could have known
remains a mystery.{\r}

462
00:43:01,127 --> 00:43:04,119
他们居无定所
{\fscx70\fscy70}Theirs was a wandering existence.{\r}

463
00:43:04,297 --> 00:43:05,992
选择了犯罪这条路…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Men who choose to be outlaws...{\r}

464
00:43:06,165 --> 00:43:10,101
…就不能在一个地方呆上太久
{\fscx70\fscy70}...cannot afford to remain in one place
for very long.{\r}

465
00:43:19,145 --> 00:43:23,411
- 喔，天哪，也许我要改变主意了
- 快走，快走
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Well, goodness. Maybe I'll change my mind.
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.{\r}

466
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:25,813
- 玛莎
- 忘了吧，哥们
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Martha.
- Buck up, man.{\r}

467
00:43:25,985 --> 00:43:29,546
伍德和迪克
在跨越整个肯塔基州的途中都在斗嘴
{\fscx70\fscy70}Wood and Dick would bicker
across the entire state of Kentucky...{\r}

468
00:43:29,722 --> 00:43:34,682
…一直到了罗斯威尔
伍德的父亲，也就是詹姆斯兄弟的叔叔…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...until they made Russellville, home
of Major George Hite, Wood's father...{\r}

469
00:43:34,861 --> 00:43:37,989
…乔治・海特上校的家
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and uncle to Frank and Jesse James.{\r}

470
00:43:46,072 --> 00:43:48,233
你离她远点
{\fscx70\fscy70}You stay away from this one.{\r}

471
00:43:49,008 --> 00:43:51,033
他是我爸的妻子
{\fscx70\fscy70}She's my daddy's wife.{\r}

472
00:43:51,978 --> 00:43:53,309
明白了吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You got it?{\r}

473
00:44:17,236 --> 00:44:18,863
这菜是您做的吗，太太？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Did you cook this, ma'am?{\r}

474
00:44:22,174 --> 00:44:24,438
我有个黑人女仆
{\fscx70\fscy70}I've got a nigger woman.{\r}

475
00:44:26,546 --> 00:44:27,570
他说什么？
{\fscx70\fscy70}How's that?{\r}

476
00:44:32,018 --> 00:44:35,385
迪克问菜是不是我做的
{\fscx70\fscy70}Dick asked if I cooked this.{\r}

477
00:44:35,621 --> 00:44:37,111
是你做的吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Did you?{\r}

478
00:44:39,692 --> 00:44:40,716
不是
{\fscx70\fscy70}No.{\r}

479
00:44:49,936 --> 00:44:52,370
她嫁给他的时候知道他是这样的
{\fscx70\fscy70}She knew what he was like
when she married him.{\r}

480
00:45:18,898 --> 00:45:23,130
看来我们都是夜猫子，你和我
{\fscx70\fscy70}I guess we're the night owls, you and I.{\r}

481
00:45:24,537 --> 00:45:26,368
我很高兴
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm glad.{\r}

482
00:45:28,674 --> 00:45:30,107
怎么说？
{\fscx70\fscy70}How come?{\r}

483
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:33,704
你看起来挺有意思
{\fscx70\fscy70}You're interesting to look at.{\r}

484
00:45:34,614 --> 00:45:38,106
你的性格让人感到很舒服
{\fscx70\fscy70}You have a real pleasant disposition.{\r}

485
00:45:39,752 --> 00:45:43,688
我也说不清楚，似乎你让我感到全身温暖
{\fscx70\fscy70}And I don't know, you sort of
make me feel warm all over.{\r}

486
00:45:45,691 --> 00:45:50,355
知道吗，别人都叫我…多情浪子
{\fscx70\fscy70}You know, I'm what they call a...
An inamorato.{\r}

487
00:45:54,233 --> 00:45:58,932
嗯，我就知道你该有个外号
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, I knew
there had to be a name for it.{\r}

488
00:46:02,775 --> 00:46:04,936
如果伍德所说的片面之辞不假…
{\fscx70\fscy70}You and the Hites
don't get along too well...{\r}

489
00:46:05,111 --> 00:46:08,376
…你和海特一家相处的不大好啊
{\fscx70\fscy70}...if I'm to trust Wood and his version
of the situation.{\r}

490
00:46:09,548 --> 00:46:13,075
事实是，我们都恨透了对方
{\fscx70\fscy70}We hate each other like poison,
if you wanna know the truth.{\r}

491
00:46:13,753 --> 00:46:17,450
如果我身上着火了
海特家族大部分人都会袖手旁观
{\fscx70\fscy70}Most of the Hites wouldn't spit on me
if I was on fire.{\r}

492
00:46:19,692 --> 00:46:22,490
人们说，如果一个女人身上着了火…
{\fscx70\fscy70}They say that when a woman's on fire...{\r}

493
00:46:22,662 --> 00:46:27,099
…你应该抱着她在地上打滚
并用身体罩住她
{\fscx70\fscy70}...you're supposed to roll her around on
the ground and cover her with your body.{\r}

494
00:46:28,434 --> 00:46:31,164
哼，你欺负人
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, you are a naughty tease.{\r}

495
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:40,042
不该睡觉了吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Isn't it about bedtime?{\r}

496
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,247
好的，我只是想亲吻一下这双娇小的手
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, I'll just kiss those dainty nubbins.{\r}

497
00:46:58,197 --> 00:46:59,596
晚安
{\fscx70\fscy70}Good night.{\r}

498
00:47:14,046 --> 00:47:15,138
你有完没完？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Would you stop?{\r}

499
00:47:20,419 --> 00:47:24,446
孩子，我想我咖啡喝多了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Boy, I believe I drank too much coffee.{\r}

500
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,493
受不了了，我要去趟厕所
{\fscx70\fscy70}I gotta go visit the privy
something terrible.{\r}

501
00:48:00,793 --> 00:48:03,091
太难为情了
{\fscx70\fscy70}This is embarrassing.{\r}

502
00:48:03,763 --> 00:48:07,824
你继续你的吧，我不介意
{\fscx70\fscy70}Now, you go ahead and do your duty.
I don't mind.{\r}

503
00:48:09,001 --> 00:48:13,062
和一个陌生男人一起在厕所里
我可感到有些惊讶
{\fscx70\fscy70}I've sort of got stage fright with
a strange man in the commode with me.{\r}

504
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:14,763
为什么会陌生呢
{\fscx70\fscy70}I ain't strange.{\r}

505
00:48:15,074 --> 00:48:17,975
我和其他男人的构造没什么区别
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm built just like the rest of them.{\r}

506
00:48:20,713 --> 00:48:23,807
你看起来美极了
{\fscx70\fscy70}You look awful pretty.{\r}

507
00:48:25,217 --> 00:48:26,980
是吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Do I?{\r}

508
00:48:27,353 --> 00:48:32,017
我这辈子还从没见过这么美的大腿
{\fscx70\fscy70}I haven't never in my life seen
such well-shaped limbs.{\r}

509
00:48:39,598 --> 00:48:41,725
伍德还醒着么？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Is Wood awake?{\r}

510
00:48:43,969 --> 00:48:45,231
这里只有我
{\fscx70\fscy70}It's just me.{\r}

511
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,014
希望你还能当我是个淑女
{\fscx70\fscy70}And I bet you thought I was a lady.{\r}

512
00:49:43,829 --> 00:49:46,161
嗯，看上去你不大会收拾啊，对吧？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, you ain't much of a housekeeper,
are you?{\r}

513
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:51,196
你不是偶尔路过
{\fscx70\fscy70}You didn't just happen by.{\r}

514
00:49:53,606 --> 00:49:55,301
为什么呢？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Why not?{\r}

515
00:50:22,568 --> 00:50:25,469
过来休息一下吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}Go on and take a load off your feet.{\r}

516
00:50:50,496 --> 00:50:52,555
你该讨个老婆了
{\fscx70\fscy70}You ought to get yourself a wife.{\r}

517
00:50:52,932 --> 00:50:54,297
是啊
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah.{\r}

518
00:50:54,533 --> 00:50:56,364
我想是的
{\fscx70\fscy70}I suppose.{\r}

519
00:50:59,738 --> 00:51:02,969
我想问问玛莎，查理的姐姐
{\fscx70\fscy70}I was gonna ask Martha. Charley's sister.{\r}

520
00:51:03,142 --> 00:51:06,509
我想问问她有没有这个意思
{\fscx70\fscy70}I was gonna ask her
if she could imagine it.{\r}

521
00:51:07,746 --> 00:51:10,613
但估计伍德有他自己的打算
{\fscx70\fscy70}But I guess Wood has plans of his own.{\r}

522
00:51:11,216 --> 00:51:13,844
而且迪克・利都还总是在中间插一腿
{\fscx70\fscy70}And there's always Dick Liddil
getting in the way.{\r}

523
00:51:14,954 --> 00:51:16,922
但我还是会考虑一下
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'll give it some thought, though.{\r}

524
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:19,658
庄稼收成怎样？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Your crops come in?{\r}

525
00:51:20,859 --> 00:51:25,956
没啥收获，只有一个小园子和一个牧场
{\fscx70\fscy70}No, I don't got much.
Just a garden patch and a pasture.{\r}

526
00:51:28,233 --> 00:51:30,599
播种时我正好生病了
{\fscx70\fscy70}I was sick at planting time.{\r}

527
00:51:31,603 --> 00:51:33,002
所以…
{\fscx70\fscy70}So...{\r}

528
00:51:35,207 --> 00:51:37,539
艾德，你怎么了？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Ed, how you feeling now?{\r}

529
00:51:40,379 --> 00:51:41,437
为什么这么问？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Why?{\r}

530
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:45,544
你举止有点古怪
{\fscx70\fscy70}You're acting queer.{\r}

531
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:57,722
是么，因为你我最近关系不是很好
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, you and me ain't been
just real good friends lately.{\r}

532
00:51:58,697 --> 00:52:01,791
这不是你的错，你心里明白
{\fscx70\fscy70}That's not your fault,
you understand that.{\r}

533
00:52:04,136 --> 00:52:05,763
但你也听到传言了
{\fscx70\fscy70}You hear talk, though.{\r}

534
00:52:07,806 --> 00:52:09,296
传言？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Talk?{\r}

535
00:52:13,112 --> 00:52:15,342
别人谈论你
{\fscx70\fscy70}People tell you things.{\r}

536
00:52:22,888 --> 00:52:24,981
你说来听听？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Why don't you give me an example?{\r}

537
00:52:29,294 --> 00:52:31,421
吉姆・康明斯来过这里
{\fscx70\fscy70}Jim Cummins come by here.{\r}

538
00:52:33,065 --> 00:52:34,396
吉姆・康明斯
{\fscx70\fscy70}Jim Cummins.{\r}

539
00:52:35,601 --> 00:52:37,899
噢，吉姆说
{\fscx70\fscy70}Oh, and Jim says:{\r}

540
00:52:40,439 --> 00:52:44,136
“你认识那些因为蓝切地案被捕的家伙？”
{\fscx70\fscy70}"You know them boys
that got caught in the Blue Cut deal?"{\r}

541
00:52:47,212 --> 00:52:50,841
这个，吉姆说他听到谣言…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, Jim says he got word...{\r}

542
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:57,580
…说你准备杀了他们
{\fscx70\fscy70}...that you're planning to kill them.{\r}

543
00:52:59,425 --> 00:53:01,689
我为什么要那么做？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Why would I do that?{\r}

544
00:53:03,629 --> 00:53:05,756
也许只是谣言而已
{\fscx70\fscy70}That's just talk probably.{\r}

545
00:53:09,768 --> 00:53:13,602
吉姆・康明斯，他还说了别的什么？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Jim Cummins. He say anything else?{\r}

546
00:53:13,972 --> 00:53:17,840
没了，基本上，就这些
{\fscx70\fscy70}Nope. No, that was it, basically.{\r}

547
00:53:28,253 --> 00:53:30,653
但我还是不明白你为什么害怕
{\fscx70\fscy70}That still don't explain why you're scared.{\r}

548
00:53:34,293 --> 00:53:37,160
这个，因为你知道
我的处境也和他们一样
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, I'm in the same situation, you see.{\r}

549
00:53:37,896 --> 00:53:39,921
我看到你骑马过来的时候很害怕
{\fscx70\fscy70}I was terrified I saw you ride up.{\r}

550
00:53:40,566 --> 00:53:43,558
- 我只是路过，艾德
- 但也许你听到传言了
{\fscx70\fscy70}- I just happened by, Ed.
- Suppose you heard gossip, though.{\r}

551
00:53:43,735 --> 00:53:46,670
也许你听说吉姆・康明斯来过
也许你会想…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Suppose you heard Jim Cummins
come by, you might have thought...{\r}

552
00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:51,799
…我们准备抓住你去领赏钱
没这回事
{\fscx70\fscy70}...that we were planning to capture you
or get that reward, and that ain't true.{\r}

553
00:53:51,977 --> 00:53:54,275
但你有可能会怀疑
{\fscx70\fscy70}But you might have suspected it.{\r}

554
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:15,225
最近没听说什么闲言碎语
{\fscx70\fscy70}Haven't heard a lick of gossip lately.{\r}

555
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,837
我藏着六百块钱呢，我不需要政府的赏金
{\fscx70\fscy70}I got 600 dollars stashed away.
I don't need no governor's reward.{\r}

556
00:54:22,741 --> 00:54:24,675
嗯，这也是原则问题
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, it's the principle too.{\r}

557
00:54:29,681 --> 00:54:31,171
那么…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well...{\r}

558
00:54:31,483 --> 00:54:34,975
- 很高兴路过这里
- 噢，我也是
{\fscx70\fscy70}- I'm glad I stopped by.
- Oh, me too.{\r}

559
00:54:59,778 --> 00:55:02,838
我们一起出去骑马如何？
{\fscx70\fscy70}What do you say
if we were to go for a ride?{\r}

560
00:55:07,786 --> 00:55:10,653
我们可以去镇上，我请你吃晚饭
{\fscx70\fscy70}We can go into town. I'll buy you dinner.{\r}

561
00:55:12,257 --> 00:55:14,555
然后我走我的
{\fscx70\fscy70}Then I'll be on my way.{\r}

562
00:55:23,535 --> 00:55:25,264
好的
{\fscx70\fscy70}Okay.{\r}

563
00:56:25,697 --> 00:56:27,426
有空出去骑马吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You ready to go for a ride?{\r}

564
00:56:43,215 --> 00:56:45,581
我们这是要去你那里吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}We going to your place?{\r}

565
00:56:50,422 --> 00:56:52,549
你最近有看到艾德・米勒吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You seen Ed Miller lately?{\r}

566
00:56:53,925 --> 00:56:56,052
没人看到
{\fscx70\fscy70}Nobody has.{\r}

567
00:56:59,865 --> 00:57:02,459
一定是去加州了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Must have gone off to California.{\r}

568
00:57:06,505 --> 00:57:08,837
我想知道我们这是要去哪儿
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'd still like to know where we're going.{\r}

569
00:57:14,012 --> 00:57:17,914
如果我们要去见吉姆・康明斯
你还打算去吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}If you were going to see Jim Cummins,
wouldn't you follow this road?{\r}

570
00:57:23,355 --> 00:57:25,186
我想会的
{\fscx70\fscy70}I guess so.{\r}

571
00:58:08,133 --> 00:58:09,600
你好
{\fscx70\fscy70}Howdy.{\r}

572
00:58:20,479 --> 00:58:22,606
噢，你是我爸爸的朋友吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Oh, are you friends of my pa's?{\r}

573
00:58:27,686 --> 00:58:29,517
我们是吉姆・康明斯的朋友
{\fscx70\fscy70}We're friends of Jim Cummins.{\r}

574
00:58:33,658 --> 00:58:36,559
这样，很不巧，他八月以后就不在了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, it so happens
he's been gone since August.{\r}

575
00:58:36,728 --> 00:58:38,787
他也没说去哪儿了
{\fscx70\fscy70}And never said where he gone to.{\r}

576
00:58:43,702 --> 00:58:46,933
- 我叫马特・柯林斯
- 艾伯特・福特
{\fscx70\fscy70}- I'm Matt Collins.
- Albert Ford.{\r}

577
00:58:47,105 --> 00:58:49,073
很高兴认识你
{\fscx70\fscy70}Very happy to meet you.{\r}

578
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:58,272
- 迪克・杜尔宾
- 很高兴认识你
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Dick Turpin.
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.{\r}

579
00:59:10,996 --> 00:59:12,987
我不知道他在哪里！放开我！
{\fscx70\fscy70}I don't know where he is!
Leave me alone!{\r}

580
00:59:13,165 --> 00:59:14,928
闭嘴！闭嘴！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Shut your mouth!
You shut your mouth!{\r}

581
00:59:16,902 --> 00:59:19,769
- 你给我闭嘴
- 我不知道他在哪儿！
{\fscx70\fscy70}- You shut your mouth.
- I don't know where he is!{\r}

582
00:59:20,472 --> 00:59:22,497
- 我不知道！
- 给我进来
{\fscx70\fscy70}- I don't know!
- Get in there.{\r}

583
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:24,399
闭嘴
{\fscx70\fscy70}Shut up.{\r}

584
00:59:24,576 --> 00:59:27,067
- 我不知道他在哪儿！
- 闭嘴
{\fscx70\fscy70}- I don't know where he is!
- Shut up.{\r}

585
00:59:28,146 --> 00:59:29,613
- 我不知道！
- 闭嘴
{\fscx70\fscy70}- I don't know!
- Shut up.{\r}

586
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:30,839
- 老天
- 闭嘴
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Jesus.
- Shut up.{\r}

587
00:59:31,016 --> 00:59:33,109
杰西，他只是个孩子
{\fscx70\fscy70}Jesse, he's just a kid.{\r}

588
00:59:33,518 --> 00:59:37,181
他知道他的吉姆叔叔在哪里
这会让他很快变老
{\fscx70\fscy70}He knows where his uncle Jim is and
that's gonna make him old soon enough.{\r}

589
00:59:37,355 --> 00:59:39,653
- 也许他真的不知道
- 他知道！
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Maybe he doesn't know.
- He knows!{\r}

590
00:59:39,825 --> 00:59:41,486
有时候就是要多问几次
{\fscx70\fscy70}You need to ask and ask sometimes.{\r}

591
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:45,289
有时候小孩子一开始并不记得
但过一阵子就会想起来
{\fscx70\fscy70}Sometimes a child don't remember so much
at first. But it'll come back to him.{\r}

592
00:59:47,332 --> 00:59:49,857
老天，快能撕下来了，宝贝
{\fscx70\fscy70}My goodness, she's about to rip off,
sweetie.{\r}

593
00:59:50,035 --> 00:59:52,026
再用点力就能撕出口来了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Just a little more here to get her started.{\r}

594
00:59:52,204 --> 00:59:54,968
然后我就能像撕一页书那样把它扯下来了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Then I think I can rip her off
like a page from a book.{\r}

595
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,233
老天，他都说不了话
{\fscx70\fscy70}Jesus, he can't even talk.{\r}

596
01:00:00,078 --> 01:00:01,636
吉姆在哪里？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Where's Jim?{\r}

597
01:00:01,813 --> 01:00:03,280
吉姆在哪里？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Where's Jim?{\r}

598
01:00:03,448 --> 01:00:05,416
吉姆在哪里？吉姆在哪里？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Where's Jim? Where's Jim?{\r}

599
01:00:05,584 --> 01:00:08,951
吉姆在哪里？吉姆在哪里？吉姆在哪里？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Where's Jim? Where's Jim? Where's Jim?{\r}

600
01:00:09,287 --> 01:00:11,551
- 吉姆在哪里？
- 放手！
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Where's Jim?
- Quit it!{\r}

601
01:00:12,057 --> 01:00:14,457
你个畜生！我不知道他在哪里！
{\fscx70\fscy70}You bastard! I don't know where he is!{\r}

602
01:00:14,626 --> 01:00:17,493
你就是不相信我！
你连说话的机会都不给我！
{\fscx70\fscy70}You won't believe me!
You never even gave me a chance!{\r}

603
01:00:17,662 --> 01:00:19,653
你把我…你把我嘴巴堵上了！
{\fscx70\fscy70}You kept my... You kept my mouth shut!{\r}

604
01:00:21,032 --> 01:00:24,433
我从来不知道
吉姆在哪里或什么时候能回来！别烦我了
{\fscx70\fscy70}I never know where Jim is or
when he comes! So leave me alone.{\r}

605
01:00:24,603 --> 01:00:27,037
放开我，你个狗娘养的！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Get off me, you son of a bitch!{\r}

606
01:01:20,091 --> 01:01:22,025
我受够了
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm worn out.{\r}

607
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,127
我不能，不能…
{\fscx70\fscy70}I can't. No, see...{\r}

608
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:30,726
反正我早已心乱如麻
{\fscx70\fscy70}My mind's all tangled anyway.{\r}

609
01:01:31,269 --> 01:01:34,727
这种小勾当都会让我感到恶心
{\fscx70\fscy70}Little deals like this
just make me feel dirty.{\r}

610
01:01:55,794 --> 01:01:57,819
你没事吧，杰西？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Are you all right, Jesse?{\r}

611
01:02:26,391 --> 01:02:28,222
杰西病倒了…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Jesse was sick...{\r}

612
01:02:28,393 --> 01:02:32,853
…感冒，疼痛，肺淤血
{\fscx70\fscy70}...with rheums, and aches
and lung congestions.{\r}

613
01:02:33,732 --> 01:02:37,031
失眠使他眼窝严重发黑
{\fscx70\fscy70}Insomnia stained
his eye sockets like soot.{\r}

614
01:02:37,869 --> 01:02:40,861
他从鸡那缠绕的肠道中…
{\fscx70\fscy70}He read auguries in
the snarled intestines of chickens...{\r}

615
01:02:42,073 --> 01:02:45,634
…或者是猫毛在风中飘散的方向中
占卜未来
{\fscx70\fscy70}...or the blow of cat hair
released to the wind.{\r}

616
01:02:46,444 --> 01:02:51,404
得到的都是凶兆，这让他感觉身陷囹圄
{\fscx70\fscy70}And the omens promised bad luck,
which moated and dungeoned him.{\r}

617
01:03:33,124 --> 01:03:35,684
为什么这些活都是你干？
{\fscx70\fscy70}How come it's you
that's gotta do all the chores?{\r}

618
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:40,092
查理和鲍勃多给了些钱给玛莎
所以他们就不用做
{\fscx70\fscy70}Charley and Bob pay extry to Martha
so that they don't have to.{\r}

619
01:03:41,399 --> 01:03:43,458
但还是不公平
{\fscx70\fscy70}It still don't seem fair.{\r}

620
01:03:50,241 --> 01:03:51,765
玛莎
{\fscx70\fscy70}Martha.{\r}

621
01:03:53,511 --> 01:03:56,105
噢，看看谁来了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, look what the cat dragged in.{\r}

622
01:04:00,919 --> 01:04:02,181
你从肯塔基来的？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You come from Kentucky?{\r}

623
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:09,424
你怎么两耳不闻窗外事，玛莎？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Why do you have your head in a hole,
Martha?{\r}

624
01:04:12,464 --> 01:04:16,195
伍德和迪克几个月前有过枪战
{\fscx70\fscy70}Wood and Dick had a shooting scrape
a few months ago.{\r}

625
01:04:17,769 --> 01:04:19,031
去看着水壶，爱达
{\fscx70\fscy70}Cover the kettle, Ida.{\r}

626
01:04:24,309 --> 01:04:26,607
你和迪克为什么那样？
{\fscx70\fscy70}And what did you and Dick
get in a scrape about?{\r}

627
01:04:30,482 --> 01:04:34,475
我爸爸的老婆在煎猪排的时候…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, he tampered
with my daddy's wife...{\r}

628
01:04:34,652 --> 01:04:38,019
…他却来和她调情…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...while a pork chop
burned on the skillet...{\r}

629
01:04:38,189 --> 01:04:39,713
…所以我向他开枪
{\fscx70\fscy70}...so I shot at him.{\r}

630
01:04:44,796 --> 01:04:49,199
爱达！
撇油脂的时候不要把大拇指伸进去！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Ida! Do not stick your thumb
in the cream when you skim it.{\r}

631
01:04:50,368 --> 01:04:55,567
他的狡诈和沾花惹草的作风…
{\fscx70\fscy70}His chicanery and his philandering ways...{\r}

632
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:57,708
…是我们之间怨恨的导火索
{\fscx70\fscy70}...has instigated such malice.{\r}

633
01:04:57,876 --> 01:05:01,812
他就像草丛中的黄蛇一样不可靠，玛莎
{\fscx70\fscy70}He's a yellow snake in the grass
and he can't be trusted, Martha.{\r}

634
01:05:04,716 --> 01:05:08,083
但这事迪克的说法和你完全不同
{\fscx70\fscy70}Dick told me a complete other version
of that affray.{\r}

635
01:05:09,554 --> 01:05:12,216
伍德・海特在楼下
{\fscx70\fscy70}Wood Hite's downstairs.{\r}

636
01:05:12,924 --> 01:05:14,619
你说他来这儿了？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You mean he's here?{\r}

637
01:05:17,395 --> 01:05:20,091
对，他昨晚很晚来的
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah, he come in late last night.{\r}

638
01:05:23,802 --> 01:05:24,826
嗨，冷静点！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hey, simmer down!{\r}

639
01:05:25,003 --> 01:05:29,565
别上去惹事了，孩子们！早饭马上就好了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Don't get into a fracas up there, you boys!
I've got breakfast almost ready.{\r}

640
01:07:40,471 --> 01:07:42,666
他还在吸气
{\fscx70\fscy70}He's still sucking air.{\r}

641
01:07:43,841 --> 01:07:46,036
但我想他应该挂了
{\fscx70\fscy70}But I think he's a goner.{\r}

642
01:07:56,187 --> 01:07:59,486
也许你们该上来祝他黄泉路上走好
{\fscx70\fscy70}Maybe y'all better come wish him well
on his journey.{\r}

643
01:08:26,284 --> 01:08:27,751
伍德？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Wood?{\r}

644
01:08:30,188 --> 01:08:32,452
你是个好伙计，伍德
{\fscx70\fscy70}You were a good fellow, Wood.{\r}

645
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:36,182
哦，希望你没受太多苦，伍德
{\fscx70\fscy70}Oh, I sure hope you're not
in frightful pain, Wood.{\r}

646
01:08:36,761 --> 01:08:40,492
我想给你点水喝，但我怕你会噎着
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'd get you something to drink,
but I'm afraid you'd just choke on it.{\r}

647
01:08:41,866 --> 01:08:44,027
小爱达会想你的
{\fscx70\fscy70}Little Ida's gonna miss you.{\r}

648
01:08:44,202 --> 01:08:46,329
家里其他人也会的
{\fscx70\fscy70}So is the rest of the family.{\r}

649
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:53,169
嗯，这事算解决了
不过不能把他带到里士满去
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, one thing's settled.
Can't take him into Richmond.{\r}

650
01:08:54,245 --> 01:08:55,303
为什么？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Why not?{\r}

651
01:08:56,781 --> 01:08:59,341
这个，一来，警察会把鲍勃抓进去
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, one, sheriff'll put Bob in jail.{\r}

652
01:08:59,517 --> 01:09:03,385
二来，要是杰西发现
他的表弟被杀死在我们这里…
{\fscx70\fscy70}And two, Jesse'll find out his cousin
Wood's been shot in our house...{\r}

653
01:09:03,554 --> 01:09:06,955
…那我们就都完了
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and then that'll be the end
of each and every one of us.{\r}

654
01:09:16,868 --> 01:09:20,531
“冷酷而又残暴得插了进来…
{\fscx70\fscy70}"And in one merciless, violent thrust
broke in...{\r}

655
01:09:20,972 --> 01:09:23,805
…伴随着香水和啤酒…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and carried all before him,
and scented and brewed...{\r}

656
01:09:23,975 --> 01:09:26,500
…还有我处子之血的味道…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...reeking with blood of my virginity...{\r}

657
01:09:26,677 --> 01:09:31,205
…在我的身体内膨胀到了极致”
{\fscx70\fscy70}...up to its utmost length in my body."{\r}

658
01:09:32,817 --> 01:09:35,684
他并没有消失，让你失望了
{\fscx70\fscy70}He ain't disappeared,
if that's what you were hoping.{\r}

659
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:42,126
你在读哪一章？
{\fscx70\fscy70}What chapter you on?{\r}

660
01:09:42,627 --> 01:09:47,655
她在直布罗陀遇到了一些阿尔及利亚海盗
{\fscx70\fscy70}She's met some Algerian corsair
down at Gibraltar.{\r}

661
01:09:47,832 --> 01:09:50,130
这让她很兴奋
{\fscx70\fscy70}Got herself all agitated.{\r}

662
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:53,903
腿怎样了？
{\fscx70\fscy70}How's that leg?{\r}

663
01:09:54,705 --> 01:09:58,869
痛得要死，鲍勃，谢谢你的关心
{\fscx70\fscy70}Full of torment, Bob. Thanks for asking.{\r}

664
01:10:44,755 --> 01:10:47,417
虚心的人有福了…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Blessed are the poor in spirit...{\r}

665
01:10:47,592 --> 01:10:49,856
…因为天国是他们的
{\fscx70\fscy70}...for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.{\r}

666
01:10:51,295 --> 01:10:56,858
哀恸的人有福了，因为他们必得安慰
{\fscx70\fscy70}Blessed are them that mourn,
for they shall be comforted.{\r}

667
01:10:59,003 --> 01:11:00,937
…的人有福了…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Blessed are the...{\r}

668
01:11:04,475 --> 01:11:05,999
温柔
{\fscx70\fscy70}Meek.{\r}

669
01:11:08,279 --> 01:11:10,110
温柔的人有福了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Blessed are the meek.{\r}

670
01:11:46,083 --> 01:11:48,142
- 是他吗？
- 是的
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Is it him?
- Yeah.{\r}

671
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:51,345
他来这儿干嘛？
你觉得他知道伍德的事情吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Why is he here? Does he know
about Wood, do you think?{\r}

672
01:11:51,522 --> 01:11:53,922
我不清楚，我只知道他不是很想念他
{\fscx70\fscy70}I don't know. All I know is
he don't miss very much.{\r}

673
01:11:54,091 --> 01:11:58,050
- 如果他问到你，我该怎么回答？
- 告诉他我和马蒂在堪萨斯城
{\fscx70\fscy70}- What should I say about you if he asks?
- Tell him I'm in K.C. With Mattie.{\r}

674
01:12:00,765 --> 01:12:04,565
他在猎杀野牛
能见到你们他真的很高兴
{\fscx70\fscy70}He was buffalo hunting.
He was thrilled to meet yours truly.{\r}

675
01:12:04,735 --> 01:12:08,671
是啊，在欧洲，有两个美国人
人们肯定认得…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah, over there in Europe there's only
two Americans they know for certain...{\r}

676
01:12:08,839 --> 01:12:11,774
…马克・吐温和杰西・詹姆斯…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...Mark Twain and Jesse James.{\r}

677
01:12:13,144 --> 01:12:16,375
- 怎么，是这个孩子
- 一切还好吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Why, it's the kid.
- How's everything?{\r}

678
01:12:18,816 --> 01:12:21,410
- 我从不摘下枪
- 是吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}- I never take off my gun belts.
- Yeah?{\r}

679
01:12:21,586 --> 01:12:23,144
好主意
{\fscx70\fscy70}Good thinking.{\r}

680
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:31,524
噢，查理，你脚受伤了？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, Charley, did you hurt your leg?{\r}

681
01:12:34,065 --> 01:12:36,090
是啊，我滑…我从屋顶滑下去了…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah, I slipped...
I slipped off the roof...{\r}

682
01:12:36,267 --> 01:12:39,862
…像个傻子一样摔在了雪地上
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and I smacked down into a snow bank
like a ton of stupidness.{\r}

683
01:12:40,037 --> 01:12:42,699
前一秒我还在惊叫，“噢，天哪”
{\fscx70\fscy70}One second I'm screaming,
"Whoa, Nelly!"{\r}

684
01:12:42,873 --> 01:12:45,535
后一秒我已经被埋在齐脖深的雪地里了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Next second, poof,
I'm neck-deep in snow.{\r}

685
01:12:48,446 --> 01:12:52,280
那么，是什么让你在大冬天爬上屋顶的？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, whatever possessed you
to climb a roof in December?{\r}

686
01:12:58,289 --> 01:13:01,747
有一个…风筝
我说啥来着？有一只猫
{\fscx70\fscy70}There was a k... A kite. What am I saying?
There was a cat.{\r}

687
01:13:01,926 --> 01:13:04,326
一只猫，在屋顶上，我去追它
{\fscx70\fscy70}A cat. It was on the roof
and I went after him.{\r}

688
01:13:04,527 --> 01:13:09,055
是只公猫，在嗷嗷叫，我就摔了
{\fscx70\fscy70}It was a tomcat yowling
and what all, and I slipped.{\r}

689
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:24,104
我以为你畸形腿了呢
{\fscx70\fscy70}I thought maybe your club foot
was gaining on you.{\r}

690
01:13:33,156 --> 01:13:34,783
是啊
{\fscx70\fscy70}Oh, yeah.{\r}

691
01:13:35,558 --> 01:13:39,790
迪克去堪萨斯见他老婆去了
他之前在这呆过一阵子
{\fscx70\fscy70}Dick went to Kansas City to be
with his wife. He was here for a bit.{\r}

692
01:13:59,415 --> 01:14:02,316
对了杰西，给你讲个可爱的故事吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hey, here's a cute story, Jess.{\r}

693
01:14:02,485 --> 01:14:05,852
鲍勃11还是12岁的时候
{\fscx70\fscy70}Bobby was what, 11 or 12...{\r}

694
01:14:06,022 --> 01:14:09,185
非常非常仰慕你
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and you were by far
his most admired personage.{\r}

695
01:14:09,692 --> 01:14:10,852
不停地讲你
{\fscx70\fscy70}He couldn't get enough.{\r}

696
01:14:11,027 --> 01:14:15,225
“杰西这样”、“杰西那样”
一天到晚说不倦
{\fscx70\fscy70}It was "Jesse this" and "Jesse that"
and "Jesse this" from sunrise to sunset.{\r}

697
01:14:15,398 --> 01:14:16,524
真有趣
{\fscx70\fscy70}Fascinating.{\r}

698
01:14:16,699 --> 01:14:18,428
还有更逗的呢
{\fscx70\fscy70}No, there's more. This is cute.{\r}

699
01:14:18,601 --> 01:14:23,368
有次我们在吃饭，鲍勃问
“你们知道杰西穿几号鞋吗？”
{\fscx70\fscy70}We're at supper and Bob asks,
"You know what size boot Jesse wears?"{\r}

700
01:14:23,539 --> 01:14:27,270
- 查理，杰西不想听这个
- 鲍勃别插嘴，让我说嘛
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Charley, Jesse doesn't wanna hear this.
- Shush, now, Bob, let me tell it.{\r}

701
01:14:27,443 --> 01:14:30,469
鲍勃说，“你知道杰西穿几号鞋吗？”
{\fscx70\fscy70}Bob says... He says, "You know
what size boot Jesse wears?"{\r}

702
01:14:30,646 --> 01:14:33,809
他说，“6寸半”，还说，“这够大吗？”
{\fscx70\fscy70}He says, "Six and a half." He says,
"Ain't that a big enough boot...{\r}

703
01:14:33,983 --> 01:14:35,780
“他五尺八寸高呢”
{\fscx70\fscy70}...for a man 5'8"tall?"{\r}

704
01:14:35,952 --> 01:14:39,786
我就想逗逗他，他是我小弟弟嘛
{\fscx70\fscy70}I decided to josh him a little, you know,
he being my kid brother and everything.{\r}

705
01:14:39,956 --> 01:14:43,050
我就说，“因为他没有脚指头啊"
{\fscx70\fscy70}So I said, "He doesn't have toes is why."{\r}

706
01:14:43,226 --> 01:14:44,750
这故事太傻了啊
{\fscx70\fscy70}That's a really stupid story.{\r}

707
01:14:44,927 --> 01:14:49,523
“他有一次脚泡在水沟里，
趾头被鲶鱼啃没了”
{\fscx70\fscy70}"He was dangling his feet off a culvert
and a catfish nibbled his toes off."{\r}

708
01:14:49,699 --> 01:14:52,429
鲍勃想破了头，就是想不明白
{\fscx70\fscy70}Bob taxed himself trying to picture it.{\r}

709
01:14:59,308 --> 01:15:01,970
如果你觉得这故事好笑的话，
倒是个好笑话
{\fscx70\fscy70}That'd be a good joke if it was funny.{\r}

710
01:15:02,812 --> 01:15:05,337
很逗吧，杰西？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Isn't that a cute story, Jess?{\r}

711
01:15:15,224 --> 01:15:18,091
多给我讲讲吧，鲍勃
{\fscx70\fscy70}Give me some more conversations, Bob.{\r}

712
01:15:23,166 --> 01:15:28,331
我想到了一个更牛的，是关于你…
{\fscx70\fscy70}I got one. This one's about as crackerjack...
It's the one about your...{\r}

713
01:15:28,504 --> 01:15:30,404
让鲍勃讲吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}Let Bob tell it.{\r}

714
01:15:31,774 --> 01:15:33,571
好吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}All right.{\r}

715
01:15:40,116 --> 01:15:42,107
我都不知道你说什么
{\fscx70\fscy70}I don't even know
what you're talking about.{\r}

716
01:15:42,285 --> 01:15:46,278
你不是说你和杰西有很多共同点嘛
{\fscx70\fscy70}About how you and Jesse
have so much in common.{\r}

717
01:15:49,325 --> 01:15:50,986
来讲讲吧，鲍勃
{\fscx70\fscy70}Go on, Bob.{\r}

718
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:53,128
对啊，快，鲍勃
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah, come on, Bob.{\r}

719
01:15:53,863 --> 01:15:56,127
给我们讲个故事
{\fscx70\fscy70}Tell us a story.{\r}

720
01:15:58,067 --> 01:16:02,663
- 不要
- 快啦，让杰西高兴一下
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Nope. No.
- Come on, entertain Jesse. He's here.{\r}

721
01:16:09,612 --> 01:16:11,136
说嘛
{\fscx70\fscy70}Come on.{\r}

722
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:21,922
说了你不要生气，我觉得
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, if you'll pardon my saying so,
I guess...{\r}

723
01:16:22,091 --> 01:16:26,152
我们俩有很多重叠的地方，挺有趣的
{\fscx70\fscy70}...it is interesting the many ways
you and I overlap and whatnot.{\r}

724
01:16:27,463 --> 01:16:30,227
从我们的爸爸说起吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}I mean, you begin with our daddies.{\r}

725
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:33,368
你爸爸是个浸信会牧师
{\fscx70\fscy70}Your daddy was a pastor
at the New Hope Baptist Church...{\r}

726
01:16:33,536 --> 01:16:38,269
而我爸爸是艾克塞尔西奥泉市的牧师
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and my daddy was a pastor
at the church in Excelsior Springs.{\r}

727
01:16:39,709 --> 01:16:44,043
你是家里三个兄弟中最小的
我家五兄弟，我最小
{\fscx70\fscy70}You're the youngest of three James boys,
and I'm the youngest of five Ford boys.{\r}

728
01:16:45,848 --> 01:16:48,510
查理和我中间还有一个哥哥，韦伯
{\fscx70\fscy70}Between Charley and me,
there's another brother, Wilbur...{\r}

729
01:16:48,684 --> 01:16:50,709
他的名字是六个字母的
{\fscx70\fscy70}...with six letters in his name.{\r}

730
01:16:51,053 --> 01:16:56,650
你和弗兰克中间有个哥哥叫罗伯特
名字也是六个字母的
{\fscx70\fscy70}And between Frank and you, is another
brother Robert, also with six letters.{\r}

731
01:16:56,859 --> 01:17:00,590
恰好我的洗礼教名也是罗伯特
{\fscx70\fscy70}And my Christian name
is Robert, of course.{\r}

732
01:17:01,931 --> 01:17:04,092
你眼睛是蓝的，我也是
{\fscx70\fscy70}You have blue eyes, I have blue eyes.{\r}

733
01:17:04,267 --> 01:17:08,260
你五尺八寸高，我也是
{\fscx70\fscy70}You're 5'8"tall, I'm 5'8" tall.{\r}

734
01:17:13,009 --> 01:17:18,379
我12岁的时候列出来一长串的相似点
比你睡衣还长呢
{\fscx70\fscy70}Me, I must have had a list as long as
your nightshirt when I was 12, but...{\r}

735
01:17:18,548 --> 01:17:21,984
但是长大后这种好奇心了就没了
{\fscx70\fscy70}...I seem to have lost some curiosities
over the years.{\r}

736
01:17:40,271 --> 01:17:42,466
他还真厉害
{\fscx70\fscy70}Ain't he something?{\r}

737
01:17:55,052 --> 01:17:59,250
我有没有给你们讲过
有个叫乔治・谢坡德的家伙
{\fscx70\fscy70}Did I ever tell you the story about
that scalawag, George Shepherd?{\r}

738
01:17:59,557 --> 01:18:01,457
他是考崔尔（内战时南方联盟游击队指挥官）
底下的一个官兵
{\fscx70\fscy70}Shepherd's one of
Quantrill's lieutenants.{\r}

739
01:18:01,625 --> 01:18:04,321
我想起他是因为
他的故事和鲍勃有点像
{\fscx70\fscy70}He give me a story much like Bob's
what bring him to mind.{\r}

740
01:18:04,795 --> 01:18:07,320
他给我讲
我们俩有多少多少相似点
{\fscx70\fscy70}Going on about how much
we had in common, and so on...{\r}

741
01:18:07,498 --> 01:18:10,023
就想加入我们
{\fscx70\fscy70}...so he could get in the gang.{\r}

742
01:18:10,201 --> 01:18:13,329
没想到他对我心怀怨恨
{\fscx70\fscy70}How could I have known
he had a grudge against me?{\r}

743
01:18:13,504 --> 01:18:17,998
没想到他为了赢得我欢心，谎话连篇
{\fscx70\fscy70}How could I have known
he was lying to get on my good side?{\r}

744
01:18:18,175 --> 01:18:23,169
我说，"乔治，加入我们吧，很高兴你入伙”
{\fscx70\fscy70}I said, "George, come on aboard.
Glad to have you."{\r}

745
01:18:23,347 --> 01:18:28,148
乔治以为自己很聪明，但其实不然
{\fscx70\fscy70}George thought he was smart,
except he wasn't.{\r}

746
01:18:29,086 --> 01:18:32,214
有天早上，乔治进来营地
{\fscx70\fscy70}One morning, George rides into camp...{\r}

747
01:18:32,389 --> 01:18:34,584
就有二十来支枪指着他
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and about 20 guns open up on him.{\r}

748
01:18:38,395 --> 01:18:42,855
乔治只有一只眼，
要阴杰西，得有两只眼
{\fscx70\fscy70}See, old George, he only had one eye. You
gotta have two eyes, you wanna get Jesse.{\r}

749
01:18:47,705 --> 01:18:50,833
你不应该把我和乔治・谢坡德相提并论
{\fscx70\fscy70}You ought not think of me
like you do George Shepherd.{\r}

750
01:18:52,176 --> 01:18:54,406
你让我想起了他
{\fscx70\fscy70}You brought him to mind.{\r}

751
01:18:55,346 --> 01:18:57,644
这不是什么抬举我的话
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, it's not very flattering.{\r}

752
01:19:03,621 --> 01:19:06,419
饭做得真好吃，玛莎
{\fscx70\fscy70}Sure is good eating, Martha.{\r}

753
01:19:07,291 --> 01:19:09,521
你喜欢就好
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, I'm so glad you enjoyed it.{\r}

754
01:19:09,693 --> 01:19:11,854
乔治为什么会对你心怀怨恨？
{\fscx70\fscy70}How come George
had a grudge against you?{\r}

755
01:19:16,767 --> 01:19:20,863
我问你呢，乔治为什么会对你心怀怨恨？
{\fscx70\fscy70}I said, how come George
had a grudge against you?{\r}

756
01:19:26,577 --> 01:19:31,310
乔治有个侄子
他想让我在内战时，保护他侄子
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, you see, George had a nephew
he wanted me to protect during the war.{\r}

757
01:19:31,482 --> 01:19:33,712
那人身上有5000美元
{\fscx70\fscy70}This nephew had 5000 dollars on him.{\r}

758
01:19:33,884 --> 01:19:38,480
结果他被杀了，钱也被抢光
{\fscx70\fscy70}It just so happens he winds up killed
and someone swipes that money.{\r}

759
01:19:38,656 --> 01:19:42,524
乔治蹲监狱的时候，有人偷偷告诉他
{\fscx70\fscy70}And when George is in prison,
someone whispers to him:{\r}

760
01:19:42,693 --> 01:19:46,424
“是杰西・詹姆斯杀了那孩子的"
{\fscx70\fscy70}"It was Jesse James
slit the boy's throat."{\r}

761
01:19:51,168 --> 01:19:53,636
只是些流言蜚语，是吧？
{\fscx70\fscy70}It was just mean gossip, was it?{\r}

762
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:58,738
鲍勃是这方面的专家，
我们请教他吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}Bob's the expert. Let's put it to him.{\r}

763
01:20:03,814 --> 01:20:06,214
哦，天啊，我惹恼他了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Oh, dear, I made him cranky.{\r}

764
01:20:06,383 --> 01:20:10,183
我没有生气，只是以前我经历过这种事
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm not cranky. I just been
through this before is all.{\r}

765
01:20:10,354 --> 01:20:13,517
周围的人都嘲笑我，没完没了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Most people get around on making fun
of me. They don't ever let up.{\r}

766
01:20:13,691 --> 01:20:15,750
某人真够怕羞的
{\fscx70\fscy70}Someone's getting awful fresh over there.{\r}

767
01:20:15,926 --> 01:20:18,622
女人，闭嘴行吗
{\fscx70\fscy70}Woman, shut your face for once.{\r}

768
01:20:25,636 --> 01:20:27,968
我不想你溜回房间生闷气
{\fscx70\fscy70}Don't want you to skip off
to your room and pout...{\r}

769
01:20:28,138 --> 01:20:30,663
你还不知道我为什么过来这边
{\fscx70\fscy70}...without knowing why I come by
for this visit.{\r}

770
01:20:31,475 --> 01:20:33,705
为什么？想给我们道歉
{\fscx70\fscy70}Why? So you could
tell us how sorry you are...{\r}

771
01:20:33,877 --> 01:20:36,437
因为你揍了我们的堂弟艾伯特一顿？
{\fscx70\fscy70}...you had to slap our cousin Albert around?{\r}

772
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:51,891
我过来
{\fscx70\fscy70}I come by...{\r}

773
01:20:52,062 --> 01:20:55,463
是想问你们两兄弟
{\fscx70\fscy70}...to ask if one of you two Fords...{\r}

774
01:20:55,666 --> 01:20:59,033
想不想和我一起上路
{\fscx70\fscy70}...would care to ride with me
in a journey or two.{\r}

775
01:20:59,436 --> 01:21:02,803
我看我们都觉得应该选查理吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}I guess we both agree
it ought to be Charley.{\r}

776
01:21:02,973 --> 01:21:05,771
你太急躁了点
{\fscx70\fscy70}You've been acting sort of testy.{\r}

777
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:38,970
你最近有没有见过伍德・海特？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Have you seen Wood Hite lately?{\r}

778
01:21:39,476 --> 01:21:43,003
没有
{\fscx70\fscy70}No. Not at all.{\r}

779
01:21:50,988 --> 01:21:53,650
这炖菜里肯定加了松鼠肉
{\fscx70\fscy70}I swear that stew
had some squirrel meat in it.{\r}

780
01:21:53,824 --> 01:21:56,520
- 还在和他吵？
- 对
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Still arguing with you, is it?
- Yeah.{\r}

781
01:21:57,294 --> 01:21:59,228
- 你是查尔斯・福特？
- 是的，太太
{\fscx70\fscy70}- You're Charles Ford?
- Yes, ma'am.{\r}

782
01:21:59,396 --> 01:22:01,455
我们以前见过
{\fscx70\fscy70}You've seen me once or twice before.{\r}

783
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,734
我有封乔治・海特寄来的信
{\fscx70\fscy70}I got a letter from George Hite.{\r}

784
01:22:05,369 --> 01:22:08,270
他找不到他儿子了
{\fscx70\fscy70}He hasn't seen hide nor hair of him.{\r}

785
01:22:09,773 --> 01:22:11,968
你说你没见过伍德？
{\fscx70\fscy70}And you say you haven't seen Wood?{\r}

786
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:15,873
我想不出来他能去哪
{\fscx70\fscy70}No, l... I can't imagine where he could be.{\r}

787
01:22:43,274 --> 01:22:44,298
是吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah?{\r}

788
01:22:45,476 --> 01:22:47,637
睡够了没？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You finished with your sleeping?{\r}

789
01:22:49,146 --> 01:22:51,671
如果没什么事的话，我想多睡几个小时
{\fscx70\fscy70}I could use a couple more hours
if it's no trouble.{\r}

790
01:23:03,327 --> 01:23:04,885
好吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah.{\r}

791
01:23:08,532 --> 01:23:12,969
我内心一直很挣扎，不知道该不该告诉你
{\fscx70\fscy70}I been holding a discussion with myself
over if I ought to tell you this or no.{\r}

792
01:23:13,137 --> 01:23:15,799
但最后我善良的一面赢了
{\fscx70\fscy70}My good side won out and...{\r}

793
01:23:17,008 --> 01:23:19,909
我想把事情说清楚
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, I wanna make a clean breast
of things.{\r}

794
01:23:21,012 --> 01:23:25,176
可是我现在脑子还不太清楚
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah, my mind's a little cobwebby
is the only drawback.{\r}

795
01:23:25,349 --> 01:23:30,150
我还想再…再睡一会
{\fscx70\fscy70}I could use a little...
A little more sleep.{\r}

796
01:23:32,690 --> 01:23:34,715
你知道我去了肯德基州吧？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You know I went to Kentucky?{\r}

797
01:23:35,693 --> 01:23:37,126
知道
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah.{\r}

798
01:23:37,828 --> 01:23:40,262
我回来途经萨林县
{\fscx70\fscy70}I come back through Saline County and...{\r}

799
01:23:41,665 --> 01:23:43,530
我想
{\fscx70\fscy70}...I think to myself:{\r}

800
01:23:44,068 --> 01:23:48,835
“不如去看看艾德・米勒吧？”
{\fscx70\fscy70}"Why not stop by and see Ed Miller?"{\r}

801
01:23:51,008 --> 01:23:52,737
我就去看了
{\fscx70\fscy70}So I do.{\r}

802
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:59,913
不过结果我不太满意
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, things are not to my satisfaction.{\r}

803
01:24:02,053 --> 01:24:04,817
艾德为了某些事，惶惶终日的
{\fscx70\fscy70}Ed's got himself all worked up
over something.{\r}

804
01:24:06,357 --> 01:24:09,622
我看得出来，他在扯谎
{\fscx70\fscy70}I can see that he's lying like a rug.{\r}

805
01:24:12,963 --> 01:24:16,057
我就对自己说，“适可而止吧”
{\fscx70\fscy70}So I say to myself, "Enough's enough."{\r}

806
01:24:16,567 --> 01:24:19,365
我对艾德说，“艾德”
{\fscx70\fscy70}And I say to Ed, "Come on, Ed.{\r}

807
01:24:20,304 --> 01:24:22,636
“咱们出去走走吧”
{\fscx70\fscy70}Let's go for a ride."{\r}

808
01:24:24,442 --> 01:24:27,343
你明白我说什么吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You understand what I'm saying?{\r}

809
01:24:28,579 --> 01:24:31,548
出去走走就是
{\fscx70\fscy70}Going for a ride is like...{\r}

810
01:24:32,616 --> 01:24:35,744
出去走走就是给他苦头吃的意思？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Going for a ride
is like giving him what-for?{\r}

811
01:24:37,721 --> 01:24:39,450
正是
{\fscx70\fscy70}Exactly.{\r}

812
01:24:43,928 --> 01:24:45,395
那么…
{\fscx70\fscy70}So...{\r}

813
01:24:48,099 --> 01:24:49,964
艾德和杰西…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...Ed and Jesse...{\r}

814
01:24:52,369 --> 01:24:54,633
…在路上吵起来了
{\fscx70\fscy70}...they argue on the road.{\r}

815
01:24:59,076 --> 01:25:01,408
你有没有数过星星？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Did you ever count the stars?{\r}

816
01:25:04,882 --> 01:25:08,818
我每次数的都不一样，它们不停在变
{\fscx70\fscy70}I can't ever get the same number.
They keep changing on me.{\r}

817
01:25:10,688 --> 01:25:13,714
我连星星到底是什么都不清楚
{\fscx70\fscy70}I don't even know what a star is exactly.{\r}

818
01:25:16,427 --> 01:25:18,622
你的身体知道
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, your body knows.{\r}

819
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:21,998
只是你的心忘记了
{\fscx70\fscy70}It's your mind that forgot.{\r}

820
01:25:31,775 --> 01:25:34,835
你先走，我会追上你的
{\fscx70\fscy70}You go on ahead, partner.
I'll catch up with you.{\r}

821
01:26:15,052 --> 01:26:16,883
没事
{\fscx70\fscy70}It's okay.{\r}

822
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:43,168
没事的，亲爱的，没事
{\fscx70\fscy70}It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.{\r}

823
01:26:46,183 --> 01:26:48,651
吵到紧要关头上
{\fscx70\fscy70}And when push came to shove...{\r}

824
01:26:55,526 --> 01:26:57,926
杰西一枪把艾德给毙了
{\fscx70\fscy70}...Jesse shot and killed him.{\r}

825
01:27:01,265 --> 01:27:03,130
杰西杀了他
{\fscx70\fscy70}Jesse did.{\r}

826
01:27:05,603 --> 01:27:07,332
你猜对了
{\fscx70\fscy70}You got it.{\r}

827
01:27:09,373 --> 01:27:10,738
你…
{\fscx70\fscy70}You...{\r}

828
01:27:27,324 --> 01:27:29,292
你看
{\fscx70\fscy70}So, you see, your...{\r}

829
01:27:29,493 --> 01:27:31,961
你堂弟，我没拿他怎么样
{\fscx70\fscy70}Your cousin, he got off easy.{\r}

830
01:27:32,129 --> 01:27:33,721
只是跟他玩玩而已
{\fscx70\fscy70}I was just playing with Albert.{\r}

831
01:27:35,232 --> 01:27:38,895
是啊，我有时候也弄得他直嚷嚷
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah, I made him squeal
once or twice myself.{\r}

832
01:27:39,203 --> 01:27:42,263
只是没你那么彻底而已
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm just not as thorough as you are.{\r}

833
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:56,576
作为交换，你有故事要告诉我吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You got a tale to swap with me now?{\r}

834
01:28:05,362 --> 01:28:07,762
我不明白你意思
{\fscx70\fscy70}I don't get your meaning.{\r}

835
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:15,135
我觉得，如果你也有什么事情要坦白的话
{\fscx70\fscy70}Seems to me, if you have something
to confess in exchange...{\r}

836
01:28:15,306 --> 01:28:17,467
那你最好
{\fscx70\fscy70}...it'd only be right...{\r}

837
01:28:18,375 --> 01:28:21,708
现在就马上告诉我
{\fscx70\fscy70}...that you'd spit it out now.{\r}

838
01:28:33,524 --> 01:28:35,651
我想不出有什么事情
{\fscx70\fscy70}I can't think of a single thing.{\r}

839
01:28:38,562 --> 01:28:41,326
比如，伍德・海特？
{\fscx70\fscy70}About Wood Hite, for example.{\r}

840
01:28:41,498 --> 01:28:46,333
我不会…我不都跟你说了
我不知道他去哪了
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm not gonna... I been saying over and
over I can't figure out where he's gone.{\r}

841
01:28:46,503 --> 01:28:49,563
我不能睁眼说瞎话啊
{\fscx70\fscy70}Now, I'm not gonna change my story
just to have something to spit.{\r}

842
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:52,436
- 那为什么你弟弟那么不安？
- 哪个弟弟？
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Why was your brother so agitated?
- Which?{\r}

843
01:28:53,410 --> 01:28:54,502
鲍勃
{\fscx70\fscy70}Bob.{\r}

844
01:28:55,879 --> 01:28:58,871
他一向都那样
{\fscx70\fscy70}That's just his way. He's antsy.{\r}

845
01:28:59,650 --> 01:29:01,083
知道吧？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You know?{\r}

846
01:29:17,267 --> 01:29:19,861
你继续睡觉吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}You go on back to sleep now.{\r}

847
01:29:21,505 --> 01:29:24,633
你现在倒让我不安了
{\fscx70\fscy70}You got me agitated now, you see?{\r}

848
01:29:31,048 --> 01:29:35,246
是啊，杰西在的时候，谁都安定不得
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah, just ain't no peace
when old Jesse's around.{\r}

849
01:29:35,786 --> 01:29:38,778
我老婆真可怜
{\fscx70\fscy70}You ought to pity my poor wife.{\r}

850
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:43,619
艾德・米勒是我的好朋友
{\fscx70\fscy70}Ed Miller was a good friend of mine.{\r}

851
01:29:43,794 --> 01:29:47,230
有一次打扑克的时候
他把我介绍给你的
{\fscx70\fscy70}He introduced me to you
at that one poker game.{\r}

852
01:29:47,965 --> 01:29:51,992
你真那么想听实话的话
我就跟你说，我有点生你的气
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm a little angry with you, if you
wanna know the God's honest truth.{\r}

853
01:29:54,471 --> 01:29:56,962
你也该可怜一下我
{\fscx70\fscy70}You ought to pity me too.{\r}

854
01:30:42,519 --> 01:30:46,455
为了证明和詹姆斯匪帮有联系
鲍勃告诉警方
{\fscx70\fscy70}As proof of his confederacy with
the James Gang, Bob told the authorities...{\r}

855
01:30:46,623 --> 01:30:50,115
迪克・利都正在一家租来的农舍
{\fscx70\fscy70}...that Dick Liddil was sleeping over
at the rented farmhouse...{\r}

856
01:30:50,294 --> 01:30:53,127
他的腿受伤了，在疗伤
{\fscx70\fscy70}...while his ruined leg mended.{\r}

857
01:30:58,135 --> 01:31:01,969
还画了一幅哈比森庄园的地图
{\fscx70\fscy70}And then, created a map
of the Harbison property...{\r}

858
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:08,373
只是没画上
他们埋藏伍德・海特尸体的那条小溪
{\fscx70\fscy70}...leaving out the creek where
Wood Hite's remains now moldered.{\r}

859
01:31:09,146 --> 01:31:11,341
你们被包围了！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Right, you boys are cornered!{\r}

860
01:31:11,515 --> 01:31:16,043
乖乖地出来，就不会受伤！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Come on out peaceably
and nobody'll get shot up!{\r}

861
01:31:21,191 --> 01:31:22,215
别开枪
{\fscx70\fscy70}Don't shoot!{\r}

862
01:31:26,830 --> 01:31:28,821
快出来
{\fscx70\fscy70}Come on out and show yourself!{\r}

863
01:31:43,881 --> 01:31:45,405
哈罗
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hello.{\r}

864
01:31:45,749 --> 01:31:47,376
逮到他了
{\fscx70\fscy70}We got him.{\r}

865
01:31:47,784 --> 01:31:49,809
克尔特手枪给我
{\fscx70\fscy70}Give me that Colt, son.{\r}

866
01:31:54,758 --> 01:31:57,318
- 好了
- 安德鲁・詹姆斯・利都
{\fscx70\fscy70}- All right.
- Andrew James Liddil...{\r}

867
01:31:57,494 --> 01:32:00,486
我有你的逮捕令
{\fscx70\fscy70}...I have a warrant here
for your arrest...{\r}

868
01:32:00,664 --> 01:32:05,033
那个周日，2月19日
暴风雪席卷了密苏里州
{\fscx70\fscy70}Snowstorms would move over Missouri
that Sunday, February 19th...{\r}

869
01:32:05,202 --> 01:32:08,194
使得商铺超过两天无法营业
{\fscx70\fscy70}...shutting down commerce
for more than two days.{\r}

870
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:12,570
- 走，走
- 文件在吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Go, go, go.
- Are the papers here?{\r}

871
01:32:12,743 --> 01:32:16,372
- 他想知道，文件在不在
- 我才不在乎他要什么
{\fscx70\fscy70}- He wanted to know if the papers are here.
- I don't care what he wants.{\r}

872
01:32:16,547 --> 01:32:18,412
但这并没有阻止罗伯特・福特
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yet this wouldn't prevent Robert Ford...{\r}

873
01:32:18,582 --> 01:32:20,982
去参加克里廷顿州长
{\fscx70\fscy70}...from presenting himself
to Governor Crittenden...{\r}

874
01:32:21,151 --> 01:32:24,245
周三为克莱格步枪队举行的庆功晚会
并和州长会面
{\fscx70\fscy70}...at the Craig Rifles Ball on Wednesday.{\r}

875
01:32:24,421 --> 01:32:27,982
趁着这个难得的机会
{\fscx70\fscy70}I deem it a great privilege
on this glorious occasion...{\r}

876
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:30,149
我想公开表扬
{\fscx70\fscy70}...to recognize publicly...{\r}

877
01:32:30,327 --> 01:32:32,989
亨利・克莱格队长那机智迅速的行动
{\fscx70\fscy70}...the intelligent and effective assistance...{\r}

878
01:32:33,163 --> 01:32:37,964
协助我和密苏里州
{\fscx70\fscy70}...that Captain Henry Craig has rendered
the state of Missouri and myself...{\r}

879
01:32:38,135 --> 01:32:41,593
在杰克森县
{\fscx70\fscy70}...in our joint quest
to rid Jackson County...{\r}

880
01:32:42,005 --> 01:32:43,973
消灭詹姆斯匪帮
{\fscx70\fscy70}...of the James band.{\r}

881
01:32:44,141 --> 01:32:46,769
克莱格队长的任务
{\fscx70\fscy70}The task that Captain Craig
has assumed...{\r}

882
01:32:46,944 --> 01:32:51,074
是需要无所畏惧，高度警惕
{\fscx70\fscy70}...will require fearless courage,
extraordinary vigilance...{\r}

883
01:32:51,248 --> 01:32:54,183
方法适当，才能完成的
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and an unerring selection
of instrumentalities.{\r}

884
01:32:55,352 --> 01:33:00,016
我妻子暗示我，话说到这里就够了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, I've gotten the signal from my wife
that enough is enough.{\r}

885
01:33:00,190 --> 01:33:02,556
但是，最后我还想
{\fscx70\fscy70}However, before I sit...{\r}

886
01:33:02,726 --> 01:33:05,854
希望大家和我一起
{\fscx70\fscy70}...I would like to ask you
to join me in a toast...{\r}

887
01:33:06,296 --> 01:33:09,993
向这位密苏里州的儿子
{\fscx70\fscy70}...to a great son
of the state of Missouri...{\r}

888
01:33:10,167 --> 01:33:14,001
- 我的朋友，亨利・克莱格祝酒
- 恭喜，恭喜
{\fscx70\fscy70}...my friend, Henry Craig.
- Here, here.{\r}

889
01:33:26,683 --> 01:33:28,310
是啊
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yes.{\r}

890
01:33:29,286 --> 01:33:31,117
告诉我的律师吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}Just let my attorney know.{\r}

891
01:33:38,762 --> 01:33:42,027
那是谁？是谁？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Who is that? Who is it?{\r}

892
01:33:42,366 --> 01:33:43,924
走开
{\fscx70\fscy70}Get out of the way now.{\r}

893
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:58,006
你惹的麻烦太多了
{\fscx70\fscy70}You know, you're more goddamn trouble
than you're worth, Bob.{\r}

894
01:33:58,181 --> 01:33:59,876
我只是想打个招呼而已
{\fscx70\fscy70}I was just gonna say hello.{\r}

895
01:34:00,050 --> 01:34:03,281
不行啊，鲍勃，所以把你带下来了
{\fscx70\fscy70}No, you weren't gonna do that, Bob.
That's not why you're down here.{\r}

896
01:34:03,453 --> 01:34:08,720
你以为你自己是
在晚会上华丽亮相的美女吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You think it's your goddamn coming-out.
You think you're the belle of the ball.{\r}

897
01:34:08,892 --> 01:34:13,124
上楼去，别暴露身份了，小混蛋
{\fscx70\fscy70}Now you get upstairs and try to keep your
identity secret, you silly little bastard.{\r}

898
01:34:13,296 --> 01:34:16,163
到合适的时候，州长会见你的
带他上楼
{\fscx70\fscy70}The governor'll see you in good time.
Take him up, boys.{\r}

899
01:34:21,672 --> 01:34:23,799
之后，鲍勃会被不停地盘问
{\fscx70\fscy70}Bob would later be cross-examined
repeatedly...{\r}

900
01:34:23,974 --> 01:34:28,172
解释他和警方做的交易
{\fscx70\fscy70}...about the exact nature of the deal
he had made with the authorities.{\r}

901
01:34:28,345 --> 01:34:31,280
但他的回答总是自相矛盾
{\fscx70\fscy70}And he was never consistent
in his recollections.{\r}

902
01:34:35,452 --> 01:34:39,684
我妻子在隔壁房间睡着呢
尽量轻声说话
{\fscx70\fscy70}My wife's asleep in the other room,
so let's speak as quietly as we can.{\r}

903
01:34:40,357 --> 01:34:42,587
你是迪克・利秃吧？
{\fscx70\fscy70}So you're Dick Little.{\r}

904
01:34:44,461 --> 01:34:45,985
利都
{\fscx70\fscy70}Liddil.{\r}

905
01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:48,664
什么？
{\fscx70\fscy70}I beg your pardon?{\r}

906
01:34:48,965 --> 01:34:50,557
是d的音
{\fscx70\fscy70}I spell it with two D's.{\r}

907
01:34:50,734 --> 01:34:53,100
他向我们全盘道出了
{\fscx70\fscy70}He's given us a full confession, governor.{\r}

908
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:55,363
报纸还没知道
{\fscx70\fscy70}Newspapers haven't caught onto it yet.{\r}

909
01:34:55,539 --> 01:34:59,066
您向他保证，会给他特赦
{\fscx70\fscy70}And you've guaranteed him
a conditional pardon...{\r}

910
01:34:59,242 --> 01:35:03,110
赦免他犯的所有抢劫罪
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and amnesty for all the robberies
he's committed.{\r}

911
01:35:04,748 --> 01:35:05,976
你是罗伯特・福特？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You Robert Ford?{\r}

912
01:35:09,486 --> 01:35:10,783
多大了？
{\fscx70\fscy70}How old are you?{\r}

913
01:35:12,856 --> 01:35:14,289
二十
{\fscx70\fscy70}Twenty.{\r}

914
01:35:14,591 --> 01:35:17,116
你也向汀布莱克警长投降了？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You surrender to Sheriff Timberlake
as well?{\r}

915
01:35:17,294 --> 01:35:21,196
不是，他的哥哥查理・福特
才是詹姆斯匪帮的匪徒
{\fscx70\fscy70}No, no, governor. That's his brother,
Charley Ford, he's in the James Gang.{\r}

916
01:35:21,364 --> 01:35:24,094
和小鲍勃没关系
{\fscx70\fscy70}But little Bob here,
we got nothing on Bob.{\r}

917
01:35:24,267 --> 01:35:26,827
他只是充当一个
{\fscx70\fscy70}He's just acting in capacity as a...{\r}

918
01:35:29,039 --> 01:35:31,200
秘密警探而已
{\fscx70\fscy70}...private detective.{\r}

919
01:35:32,375 --> 01:35:34,400
杰西・詹姆斯上个月给我打了个电报
{\fscx70\fscy70}Jesse James sent me a telegram
last month...{\r}

920
01:35:34,578 --> 01:35:37,741
说就算要拆了一整辆火车
他都要逮着我杀了我
{\fscx70\fscy70}...saying he'd kill me
if he had to wreck a train to do it.{\r}

921
01:35:37,914 --> 01:35:40,542
他说要是我落到他手上
他会把我的心割下来
{\fscx70\fscy70}He said once I got in his hands,
he'd cut my heart out...{\r}

922
01:35:40,717 --> 01:35:43,208
像熏肉那样撕了来吃
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and eat it in strips like it was bacon.{\r}

923
01:35:43,386 --> 01:35:45,320
我会先拆掉他的火车
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'll wreck his train first.{\r}

924
01:35:52,896 --> 01:35:57,060
抱歉，州长大人，我在想别的事情
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm sorry, Your Excellency.
I was thinking about something else.{\r}

925
01:35:57,234 --> 01:35:59,566
杰西・詹姆斯只是一个匪徒
{\fscx70\fscy70}Jesse James is nothing more
than a public outlaw...{\r}

926
01:35:59,736 --> 01:36:02,534
打家劫舍，臭名远扬
{\fscx70\fscy70}...who made his reputation
by stealing whatever he wanted...{\r}

927
01:36:02,706 --> 01:36:04,936
谁挡他的道就杀谁
{\fscx70\fscy70}...killing whoever got in his way.{\r}

928
01:36:05,108 --> 01:36:08,703
有的傻瓜说他是在报复
共和党人和联邦政府人
{\fscx70\fscy70}You'll hear some fools say he's getting back
at Republicans and Union men...{\r}

929
01:36:08,879 --> 01:36:11,643
因为内战时他的家人遭了不少罪
{\fscx70\fscy70}...for the wrongs his family suffered
during the war.{\r}

930
01:36:11,815 --> 01:36:16,548
但他甚少根据政治立场挑选受害人
{\fscx70\fscy70}But his victims have scarcely been selected
with reference to their political views.{\r}

931
01:36:17,053 --> 01:36:19,749
我跟你们说，他的罪孽很快会遭到报应
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm saying his sins will soon find him out.{\r}

932
01:36:19,923 --> 01:36:22,585
他造的孽也快到头了
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm saying his cup of iniquity is full.{\r}

933
01:36:22,759 --> 01:36:25,455
杰西・詹姆斯是个极端案件
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm saying Jesse James
is a desperate case...{\r}

934
01:36:25,762 --> 01:36:28,663
也需要极端的制裁
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and may require a desperate remedy.{\r}

935
01:36:32,002 --> 01:36:35,096
那您就找对人了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Y'all got the right man for the job.{\r}

936
01:36:51,454 --> 01:36:53,718
快走呀
{\fscx70\fscy70}Come on. Come on, now.{\r}

937
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:55,918
快走
{\fscx70\fscy70}Come on, now.{\r}

938
01:37:40,303 --> 01:37:42,863
你有没有想过自杀？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Have you ever considered suicide?{\r}

939
01:37:44,908 --> 01:37:50,244
没有吧，总是有想做的事
{\fscx70\fscy70}I can't say that I have. There's always
something else I wanted to do.{\r}

940
01:37:51,314 --> 01:37:57,184
有时候事情有转机了
有时候我会换一个角度看问题
{\fscx70\fscy70}Or my predicaments changed,
or I saw my hardships from a different slant.{\r}

941
01:37:57,354 --> 01:38:01,757
以后会发生什么事谁也不知道
自杀太不值得了
{\fscx70\fscy70}You know all what can happen.
It never seemed respectable.{\r}

942
01:38:08,531 --> 01:38:11,364
告诉你吧，有一件事是肯定的
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'll tell you one thing that's for certain.{\r}

943
01:38:11,534 --> 01:38:15,493
你窥见过死后世界之后
就不介意死掉了
{\fscx70\fscy70}You won't mind dying
once you've peeked over the other side.{\r}

944
01:38:19,276 --> 01:38:22,302
你不会再想回到你的身体里
{\fscx70\fscy70}You'll no more wanna go back
to your body than...{\r}

945
01:38:22,479 --> 01:38:24,947
就好像你不会想把自己的呕吐物
给吃回去一样
{\fscx70\fscy70}...you'd wanna spoon up your own puke.{\r}

946
01:38:31,454 --> 01:38:34,252
嘿，我们计划抢银行的话
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hey, since we're looking to rob banks...{\r}

947
01:38:34,424 --> 01:38:39,020
不如再加一个人
{\fscx70\fscy70}...I was wondering if we could
add another fella to the gang...{\r}

948
01:38:39,195 --> 01:38:42,824
下次干活的时候好保着命呀
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and sort of see if we couldn't
come out of our next job alive.{\r}

949
01:38:45,302 --> 01:38:50,296
鲍勃想知道，他下次能不能和我们
一起去打劫银行或者…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Bob wanted to know could he ride with us
next time we took on a savings bank or...{\r}

950
01:38:56,613 --> 01:38:59,081
打劫银行或者…
{\fscx70\fscy70}A savings bank or a...{\r}

951
01:39:00,817 --> 01:39:02,546
火车
{\fscx70\fscy70}A railroad.{\r}

952
01:39:09,926 --> 01:39:13,225
鲍勃看起来虽然挺小的
{\fscx70\fscy70}Bob isn't much more than a boy
to most appearances.{\r}

953
01:39:13,396 --> 01:39:16,160
但他资质还是挺好的
{\fscx70\fscy70}But there's about two tons
of sand in him.{\r}

954
01:39:16,333 --> 01:39:19,564
必要时候，他会使枪
{\fscx70\fscy70}And he'll stand with a shooter
when that's what's called for.{\r}

955
01:39:19,736 --> 01:39:24,002
他挺机灵的，心思挺细的
{\fscx70\fscy70}And he's smart too.
He's about as intricate as they come.{\r}

956
01:39:26,109 --> 01:39:28,839
我见过这孩子，你忘了？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You forget I already met the kid.{\r}

957
01:39:30,146 --> 01:39:32,876
他很仰慕你
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hell, he surely thinks highly of you.{\r}

958
01:39:33,416 --> 01:39:36,180
所有美国人都仰慕我
{\fscx70\fscy70}All of America thinks highly of me.{\r}

959
01:39:36,886 --> 01:39:40,117
但是，要找第三个人作帮手
{\fscx70\fscy70}Still, not like you got two million names
to snatch out of a sock...{\r}

960
01:39:40,290 --> 01:39:42,451
也不是说随手拈来的吧？
{\fscx70\fscy70}...whenever you need a third man.{\r}

961
01:39:45,962 --> 01:39:48,988
你在努力说服我
{\fscx70\fscy70}I can see you trying to
wear me down on this.{\r}

962
01:39:49,165 --> 01:39:51,360
我就是这个意思
{\fscx70\fscy70}That's my main intention.{\r}

963
01:40:00,443 --> 01:40:03,105
他们密谋
在内布拉斯加，科罗拉多和密苏里州
{\fscx70\fscy70}Robberies would be conceived
but never carried out...{\r}

964
01:40:03,279 --> 01:40:06,840
进行抢劫，但都没有开始行动
{\fscx70\fscy70}...in Nebraska, Colorado and Missouri.{\r}

965
01:40:07,484 --> 01:40:08,576
这时
{\fscx70\fscy70}During this time...{\r}

966
01:40:08,752 --> 01:40:12,779
亨利・克雷格指示罗伯特・福特
回到伊莱亚在里士满的杂货店
{\fscx70\fscy70}...Henry Craig enjoined Robert Ford to return
to Elias' Grocery Store in Richmond...{\r}

967
01:40:12,956 --> 01:40:16,016
并在那里等候
詹姆斯・汀伯莱克警长的指示
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and await instructions
from Sheriff James Timberlake.{\r}

968
01:40:16,459 --> 01:40:18,723
好，三罐…
{\fscx70\fscy70}All right, three cans...{\r}

969
01:40:18,895 --> 01:40:22,626
桃子，两罐
{\fscx70\fscy70}...peaches. Two cans...{\r}

970
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:26,425
两罐豌豆
{\fscx70\fscy70}Two cans sifted peas.{\r}

971
01:40:26,736 --> 01:40:28,363
一瓶
{\fscx70\fscy70}One bottle...{\r}

972
01:40:31,174 --> 01:40:34,371
玛丽牌精华露，半…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...Mary's Morning Tonic, and a half...{\r}

973
01:40:37,447 --> 01:40:40,007
半袋面粉
{\fscx70\fscy70}Half a sack of flour.{\r}

974
01:40:41,184 --> 01:40:43,243
马上回来
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'll be right with you.{\r}

975
01:40:59,235 --> 01:41:01,567
我没见过他的任何踪迹
{\fscx70\fscy70}I haven't seen any sign of him.{\r}

976
01:41:03,039 --> 01:41:05,405
你知道他住在哪里吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, do you know where he's living?{\r}

977
01:41:06,509 --> 01:41:07,874
不知道
{\fscx70\fscy70}No.{\r}

978
01:41:09,045 --> 01:41:10,478
不知道？
{\fscx70\fscy70}No?{\r}

979
01:41:13,216 --> 01:41:15,980
我不知道他是怎么做到…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, I can't guess how he does it...{\r}

980
01:41:16,152 --> 01:41:20,452
总是对一切了如指掌的
{\fscx70\fscy70}...but he is always knowledgeable
about what's going on.{\r}

981
01:41:20,623 --> 01:41:24,923
他会知道我在这里见你
你该做好这个心理准备
{\fscx70\fscy70}He's gonna know I've been here with you.
You ought to take that for granted.{\r}

982
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:31,389
一有机会他就会把你杀掉
{\fscx70\fscy70}And he will kill you if he gets the chance.{\r}

983
01:41:34,637 --> 01:41:37,197
你愿意冒这个险吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Are you willing to risk that?{\r}

984
01:41:41,811 --> 01:41:43,540
愿意
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yes, I am.{\r}

985
01:41:46,616 --> 01:41:48,345
我这辈子都那么不起眼
{\fscx70\fscy70}I've been a nobody all my life.{\r}

986
01:41:49,285 --> 01:41:51,116
永远当我是个小孩
{\fscx70\fscy70}I was the baby.{\r}

987
01:41:51,387 --> 01:41:54,823
答应我的事情也没实现过
{\fscx70\fscy70}I was the one they made promises to
that they never kept.{\r}

988
01:41:56,025 --> 01:42:00,724
我记忆中
杰西・詹姆斯永远那么高大显赫
{\fscx70\fscy70}And ever since I can remember it,
Jesse James has been as big as a tree.{\r}

989
01:42:04,167 --> 01:42:06,431
我准备好了，吉姆
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm prepared for this, Jim...{\r}

990
01:42:07,337 --> 01:42:09,498
我会完成任务的
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and I'm gonna accomplish it.{\r}

991
01:42:09,739 --> 01:42:11,832
我知道这是我唯一的机会
{\fscx70\fscy70}I know I won't get
but this one opportunity...{\r}

992
01:42:12,008 --> 01:42:14,909
我保证不会把这事毁了的
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and you can bet your life
I'm not gonna spoil it.{\r}

993
01:42:26,923 --> 01:42:27,981
那么…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well...{\r}

994
01:42:29,192 --> 01:42:31,183
等待合适的时机
{\fscx70\fscy70}...wait for your chance.{\r}

995
01:42:31,694 --> 01:42:35,095
别和他独处，还有千万…
{\fscx70\fscy70}Don't let yourself be found alone with him,
and do not...{\r}

996
01:42:35,965 --> 01:42:38,365
不要让他到你身后
{\fscx70\fscy70}...let him get behind you.{\r}

997
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,690
你被选中了
{\fscx70\fscy70}You been chosen.{\r}

998
01:43:12,669 --> 01:43:14,261
什么意思？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, what do you mean?{\r}

999
01:43:15,538 --> 01:43:18,029
你哥哥说你想加入我们
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, your brother said that
you might wanna join us.{\r}

1000
01:43:18,208 --> 01:43:21,541
不过，你对这杂货店的感情
也许比嘴上说的更深
{\fscx70\fscy70}But maybe you like this grocery store
more than you said you did.{\r}

1001
01:43:24,847 --> 01:43:26,906
- 想我了？
- 对啊
{\fscx70\fscy70}- So you missed me?
- Oh, yeah.{\r}

1002
01:43:27,584 --> 01:43:30,246
每晚想你想到哭
{\fscx70\fscy70}I been crying myself to sleep every night.{\r}

1003
01:43:39,796 --> 01:43:41,787
别让他看到我们俩
{\fscx70\fscy70}Don't let him see us so much as wink.{\r}

1004
01:43:41,965 --> 01:43:45,799
他现在多疑得跟个野狼似的，谁也不信
{\fscx70\fscy70}He's suspicious as a damn coyote,
and he don't trust you one iota.{\r}

1005
01:43:46,502 --> 01:43:48,299
- 那我想…
- 嘿
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Well, I guess that makes...
- Hey.{\r}

1006
01:43:48,471 --> 01:43:52,931
他已经干掉艾德・米勒了
还说得轻描淡写的
{\fscx70\fscy70}He already put away Ed Miller. He said so
like it was something piddly he'd done.{\r}

1007
01:44:33,916 --> 01:44:38,148
如果我们俩能单独待多过一分钟
我很想再跟你谈谈
{\fscx70\fscy70}If we're ever alone for more than a minute,
I'd like a chance to talk to you further.{\r}

1008
01:45:17,894 --> 01:45:20,124
他们给我十天时间
{\fscx70\fscy70}They gave me ten days.{\r}

1009
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,524
干吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}For what?{\r}

1010
01:45:27,503 --> 01:45:29,368
逮捕他
{\fscx70\fscy70}For arresting him.{\r}

1011
01:45:35,445 --> 01:45:37,106
你和我?
{\fscx70\fscy70}You and me, huh?{\r}

1012
01:45:40,750 --> 01:45:44,015
不是他动手就是我们动手
这事躲不过的
{\fscx70\fscy70}It's gonna happen one way or another,
Charley. It's gonna happen.{\r}

1013
01:45:44,187 --> 01:45:46,781
干嘛不趁这个机会捞点钱
{\fscx70\fscy70}So it might as well be us
who get rich on it.{\r}

1014
01:45:46,956 --> 01:45:50,255
- 鲍勃，他是我们的朋友
- 他杀了艾德・米勒
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Bob, he's our friend.
- He murdered Ed Miller.{\r}

1015
01:45:50,893 --> 01:45:53,987
一有机会，他就会去杀利都和康明斯
{\fscx70\fscy70}And he's gonna murder Liddil and Cummins
if the chance ever comes.{\r}

1016
01:45:55,431 --> 01:46:00,061
照我看来，杰西正一个个地
把帮里的兄弟做掉
{\fscx70\fscy70}It seems to me Jesse's riding from
man to man, saying goodbye to the gang.{\r}

1017
01:46:01,571 --> 01:46:03,937
你的友情会害死你的
{\fscx70\fscy70}So your friendship could put you
under the pansies.{\r}

1018
01:46:06,008 --> 01:46:10,468
我会认真考虑的，鲍勃
我现在只能到这一步了
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'll grind it fine in my mind, Bob. I can't
go any further than that right now.{\r}

1019
01:46:14,050 --> 01:46:15,483
你会想通的
{\fscx70\fscy70}You'll come around.{\r}

1020
01:46:16,619 --> 01:46:19,087
你认为这都是编造的，是吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You think it's all made up, don't you?{\r}

1021
01:46:19,255 --> 01:46:22,588
他的故事只是报纸编的
{\fscx70\fscy70}You think it's all yarns
and newspaper stories.{\r}

1022
01:46:30,466 --> 01:46:32,798
他也不过是个人
{\fscx70\fscy70}He's just a human being.{\r}

1023
01:46:41,043 --> 01:46:44,171
从今以后，你们俩不许离开我行动
{\fscx70\fscy70}From now on, you two
won't go anywhere without me.{\r}

1024
01:46:44,947 --> 01:46:49,509
从今以后，你们的行动要得到我批准！
要向我请示！
{\fscx70\fscy70}From now on, you'll ask for my permission!
From now on, you'll ask to be excused!{\r}

1025
01:47:45,441 --> 01:47:49,741
查理，把马带到马棚里
鲍勃，进屋去吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}Charley, take them horses
around the barn. Bob, you go on inside.{\r}

1026
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:51,911
- 你好，玛丽
- 嗨
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Hello, Mary.
- Hi.{\r}

1027
01:47:52,081 --> 01:47:55,244
看我在堆肥里找到的萝卜(欧洲萝卜）
{\fscx70\fscy70}Look at this rotten parsnip
I found in the compost heap.{\r}

1028
01:48:05,461 --> 01:48:07,361
你没提过鲍勃会来
{\fscx70\fscy70}You never mentioned Bob would be here.{\r}

1029
01:48:11,634 --> 01:48:14,626
可能他想留作惊喜呢
{\fscx70\fscy70}Maybe he was saving it
as a pleasant surprise.{\r}

1030
01:48:19,242 --> 01:48:21,904
现在来了两位堂兄弟做伴了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Got two cousins for company now.{\r}

1031
01:48:31,621 --> 01:48:33,919
这么着…
{\fscx70\fscy70}How it's gonna be is...{\r}

1032
01:48:34,290 --> 01:48:38,488
我们下周一下午离开，到普拉特市
{\fscx70\fscy70}...we'll leave next Monday afternoon
and ride down to Platte City.{\r}

1033
01:48:41,364 --> 01:48:43,298
离堪萨斯市多远？
{\fscx70\fscy70}How far is that from Kansas City?{\r}

1034
01:48:45,001 --> 01:48:47,834
往南三十英里
{\fscx70\fscy70}Platte City's 30 miles south.{\r}

1035
01:48:49,472 --> 01:48:54,068
你，我和查理晚上在森林里睡一夜
{\fscx70\fscy70}You and me and Charley'll
sleep in the woods overnight...{\r}

1036
01:48:54,577 --> 01:48:58,980
我们会在关门之前一段时间
进攻富国银行
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and we'll strike the Wells Bank
sometime before the court recesses.{\r}

1037
01:49:03,786 --> 01:49:06,721
具体是几点？
{\fscx70\fscy70}What time will that be exactly?{\r}

1038
01:49:12,361 --> 01:49:14,886
这你没必要知道
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, you don't need to know that.{\r}

1039
01:49:29,912 --> 01:49:32,881
我和你哥哥一起的时候很惬意
{\fscx70\fscy70}You know, I'm real comfortable
with your brother.{\r}

1040
01:49:33,115 --> 01:49:35,640
虽然他长得难看，身上也臭
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hell, he's ugly as sin,
he smells like a skunk...{\r}

1041
01:49:36,452 --> 01:49:39,888
还无知得要命
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and he's so ignorant
he couldn't drive nails in the snow...{\r}

1042
01:49:40,056 --> 01:49:42,547
但他很好相处
{\fscx70\fscy70}...but he's sort of easy to be around.{\r}

1043
01:49:43,059 --> 01:49:45,857
你就不一样了，鲍勃
{\fscx70\fscy70}I can't say the same for you, Bob.{\r}

1044
01:49:49,265 --> 01:49:51,631
你这么说让我很难过
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, I'm sorry to hear you say that.{\r}

1045
01:49:53,502 --> 01:49:57,529
你知道那种情况吧
你和你爱人在月色之下
{\fscx70\fscy70}You know how it is when you're
with your girlfriend and the moon's out...{\r}

1046
01:49:57,707 --> 01:50:01,768
虽然她从没开口说
但你知道她等着你亲她
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and you know she wants to be kissed,
even though she never said so?{\r}

1047
01:50:05,181 --> 01:50:06,614
恩
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah.{\r}

1048
01:50:09,352 --> 01:50:12,719
你的种种迹象，让我很难过
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, you're giving me signs
that grieve my soul...{\r}

1049
01:50:13,589 --> 01:50:15,716
让我觉得…
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and make me wonder...{\r}

1050
01:50:16,125 --> 01:50:18,491
可能你对我的看法已经变了
{\fscx70\fscy70}...maybe your mind's
been changed about me.{\r}

1051
01:50:18,828 --> 01:50:22,286
你要我怎么办？向天发誓？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, what do you want me to do?
Swear my good faith on the Bible?{\r}

1052
01:50:39,782 --> 01:50:41,716
你俩在吵架？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You two having a spat?{\r}

1053
01:50:46,989 --> 01:50:49,480
我正准备发火呢
{\fscx70\fscy70}I was getting ready to be angry.{\r}

1054
01:50:54,964 --> 01:50:57,296
坐过来点，孩子
{\fscx70\fscy70}Sit over here closer, kid.{\r}

1055
01:50:59,535 --> 01:51:00,797
过来过来
{\fscx70\fscy70}Come on.{\r}

1056
01:51:11,947 --> 01:51:14,279
查理，到时你看着马
{\fscx70\fscy70}Charley, you'll stay with the animals.{\r}

1057
01:51:14,950 --> 01:51:16,850
我和这孩子
{\fscx70\fscy70}Me and the kid...{\r}

1058
01:51:17,019 --> 01:51:20,978
会在中午之前走进那银行
{\fscx70\fscy70}...will walk into that bank
just before noon.{\r}

1059
01:51:22,858 --> 01:51:25,486
鲍勃会让那出纳员
{\fscx70\fscy70}Bob will move that cashier...{\r}

1060
01:51:26,028 --> 01:51:29,259
没法拿到柜台底下藏着的枪
{\fscx70\fscy70}...away from the shotgun
that's under the counter...{\r}

1061
01:51:29,432 --> 01:51:32,299
然后我就溜到那出纳员后头
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and I'll creep up behind that cashier...{\r}

1062
01:51:32,468 --> 01:51:34,800
这样把他的头朝后扳
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and I'll cock his head back like so.{\r}

1063
01:51:35,071 --> 01:51:36,095
我会说
{\fscx70\fscy70}And I'll say:{\r}

1064
01:51:36,272 --> 01:51:39,002
“象你这样的废柴怎么还活着
{\fscx70\fscy70}"How come an off-scouring
like you is still sucking air...{\r}

1065
01:51:39,175 --> 01:51:41,439
而我那么多手下就已经送命了呢？”
{\fscx70\fscy70}...when so many of mine
are in coffins?" I'll say:{\r}

1066
01:51:41,610 --> 01:51:44,943
“你怎么还能活到20岁？”
{\fscx70\fscy70}"How did you get to reach 20
without leaking out all over your clothes?"{\r}

1067
01:51:45,414 --> 01:51:49,282
如果我不喜欢他的态度
我会狠狠地割掉那小子的喉咙
{\fscx70\fscy70}And if I don't like his attitude,
I will slit that phildoodle so deep...{\r}

1068
01:51:49,585 --> 01:51:52,611
让他像条脱水的鱼一样乱跳
{\fscx70\fscy70}...he will flop on the floor like a fish.{\r}

1069
01:51:56,292 --> 01:51:58,658
天啊，发生什么了？
{\fscx70\fscy70}My God, what just happened?{\r}

1070
01:52:07,903 --> 01:52:11,270
鲍勃，我能听到你的小脑袋发动了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Boy, I could hear your gears grinding...{\r}

1071
01:52:11,574 --> 01:52:14,941
听到你在问自己
“天啊，下次他会干出什么事？”
{\fscx70\fscy70}...hear your little motor wondering,
"My gosh, what's next?{\r}

1072
01:52:15,111 --> 01:52:16,476
“我会怎么样？”
{\fscx70\fscy70}What's happening to me?"{\r}

1073
01:52:18,347 --> 01:52:20,212
看你这样子，鲍勃
{\fscx70\fscy70}You were precious to behold, Bob.{\r}

1074
01:52:20,382 --> 01:52:23,010
脸白得跟墙一样
{\fscx70\fscy70}You were white as spit in a cotton field.{\r}

1075
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:26,020
你吓到他了
{\fscx70\fscy70}You got him. You got him.{\r}

1076
01:52:27,656 --> 01:52:31,717
你想知道这是什么感觉吗？不舒服
我真的不推荐你这么做
{\fscx70\fscy70}You wanna know how that feels?
Unpleasant. I honestly can't recommend it.{\r}

1077
01:52:37,233 --> 01:52:39,701
查理看来也被吓倒了
{\fscx70\fscy70}The old Charley looked stricken!{\r}

1078
01:52:40,369 --> 01:52:42,200
是啊，是啊
{\fscx70\fscy70}I was. I was.{\r}

1079
01:52:42,371 --> 01:52:47,365
“太恐怖了”，查理想道
“把我一天的心情都毁了”
{\fscx70\fscy70}"This is plumb unexpected," old Charley
was thinking. "That done ruined my day."{\r}

1080
01:52:55,151 --> 01:52:56,584
天呀
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hell. Hell.{\r}

1081
01:53:27,550 --> 01:53:31,418
那晚，杰西和鲍勃睡在孩子们的房间
{\fscx70\fscy70}Jesse slept with Bob
in the children's room that night.{\r}

1082
01:53:32,721 --> 01:53:35,315
鲍勃一直醒着
{\fscx70\fscy70}And Bob remained awake.{\r}

1083
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:41,527
他能看到床头柜上有一把枪
{\fscx70\fscy70}He could see that there was a gun
on the nightstand.{\r}

1084
01:53:42,398 --> 01:53:46,391
他能想象自己手里握着冰冷的枪
{\fscx70\fscy70}He could imagine its cold nickel
inside his grip...{\r}

1085
01:53:47,303 --> 01:53:50,795
举起这两磅的重量，瞄准
{\fscx70\fscy70}...its two-pound weight
reached out and aimed.{\r}

1086
01:54:21,937 --> 01:54:24,030
我要上厕所
{\fscx70\fscy70}I need to go to the privy.{\r}

1087
01:54:25,241 --> 01:54:28,642
你以为你要上，但其实你不用上
{\fscx70\fscy70}You think you do, but you don't.{\r}

1088
01:54:51,867 --> 01:54:54,028
等祷告之后再吃
{\fscx70\fscy70}You wait for grace, now.{\r}

1089
01:54:54,970 --> 01:54:58,303
- 谢谢，妈妈
- 谢谢，芝，看来很好吃哦
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Thank you, Mama.
- Thank you, Zee. God, that looks good.{\r}

1090
01:54:58,474 --> 01:55:00,101
- 谢谢，芝
- 不客气
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Thank you, Zee.
- You're welcome.{\r}

1091
01:55:00,276 --> 01:55:03,370
这适合吃还是凑合？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, is this fit to eat or will it just do?{\r}

1092
01:55:06,282 --> 01:55:08,375
她做饭可是臭名远播
{\fscx70\fscy70}Woman's cooking's
always been a scandal.{\r}

1093
01:55:08,550 --> 01:55:10,916
她做的肉，切起来整张桌子都得晃
{\fscx70\fscy70}Cut her meat and the whole table moves.{\r}

1094
01:55:11,854 --> 01:55:13,913
想吃饼干吗？想要吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You want a biscuit?
You gonna have a biscuit?{\r}

1095
01:55:14,089 --> 01:55:17,889
给你黄油，来
{\fscx70\fscy70}Here's some butter.
Come on. Come on.{\r}

1096
01:55:19,828 --> 01:55:21,125
哦，妈的
{\fscx70\fscy70}Oh, shoot.{\r}

1097
01:55:21,297 --> 01:55:25,097
杰西变得越来越平易近人
{\fscx70\fscy70}And so it went,
Jesse was increasingly cavalier...{\r}

1098
01:55:25,267 --> 01:55:28,998
和蔼，情绪化，沉郁
{\fscx70\fscy70}...merry, moody, fey...{\r}

1099
01:55:29,171 --> 01:55:31,264
不可预测
{\fscx70\fscy70}...unpredictable.{\r}

1100
01:55:32,808 --> 01:55:35,936
他把抑郁和狂乱隐藏起来
{\fscx70\fscy70}He camouflaged his depressions
and derangements...{\r}

1101
01:55:36,111 --> 01:55:40,104
用高度的诚恳和风度来掩饰
{\fscx70\fscy70}...with masquerades
of extreme cordiality, courtesy...{\r}

1102
01:55:40,282 --> 01:55:43,046
假装对人好心好意
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and goodwill towards others.{\r}

1103
01:55:44,119 --> 01:55:48,385
但即使他开玩笑的时候
或者给他儿子呵痒的时候
{\fscx70\fscy70}But even as he jested,
or tickled his boy in the ribs...{\r}

1104
01:55:48,557 --> 01:55:52,186
杰西都会用忧郁的眼神看着鲍勃
{\fscx70\fscy70}...Jesse would look over at Bob
with melancholy eyes...{\r}

1105
01:55:52,361 --> 01:55:56,320
两人仿佛在进行亲密深邃的交流
{\fscx70\fscy70}...as if the two were meshed
in an intimate communication.{\r}

1106
01:55:59,134 --> 01:56:01,762
鲍勃坚信杰西看穿了他
{\fscx70\fscy70}Bob was certain that the man
had unriddled him...{\r}

1107
01:56:01,937 --> 01:56:04,599
看穿了他为什么跟来
{\fscx70\fscy70}...had seen through his reasons
for coming along...{\r}

1108
01:56:04,773 --> 01:56:08,766
坚信杰西能预测鲍勃任何的行动和企图
{\fscx70\fscy70}...that Jesse could forecast each of
Bob's possible moves and inclinations...{\r}

1109
01:56:08,944 --> 01:56:10,775
杰西只是在扮无辜
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and was only acting the innocent...{\r}

1110
01:56:10,946 --> 01:56:15,883
好让鲍勃放松警惕
{\fscx70\fscy70}...in order to lull Bob
into stupid tranquility and miscalculation.{\r}

1111
01:56:37,573 --> 01:56:39,768
你盯着我看多久了？
{\fscx70\fscy70}How long you been studying me?{\r}

1112
01:56:41,677 --> 01:56:44,407
你会让很多人伤心的
{\fscx70\fscy70}You're gonna break a lot of hearts.{\r}

1113
01:56:52,321 --> 01:56:53,515
什么意思？
{\fscx70\fscy70}How do you mean?{\r}

1114
01:57:02,765 --> 01:57:04,494
是份礼物
{\fscx70\fscy70}It's a present.{\r}

1115
01:57:09,171 --> 01:57:10,729
很沉
{\fscx70\fscy70}It's heavy.{\r}

1116
01:57:11,306 --> 01:57:13,433
打开看看？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, you gonna look inside?{\r}

1117
01:57:15,010 --> 01:57:16,807
今天是愚人节
{\fscx70\fscy70}It's April Fools' Day, you know.{\r}

1118
01:57:17,379 --> 01:57:19,210
这可不是个玩笑
{\fscx70\fscy70}It ain't no joke.{\r}

1119
01:57:26,722 --> 01:57:28,280
太华丽了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Oh, such extravagance.{\r}

1120
01:57:29,825 --> 01:57:32,521
闪亮亮的，是吧？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Don't that nickel just shine, though?{\r}

1121
01:57:32,728 --> 01:57:34,286
我做梦都没想过
{\fscx70\fscy70}It's more than I could hope for.{\r}

1122
01:57:34,463 --> 01:57:37,261
你那老破枪，说不定下次开枪的时候
{\fscx70\fscy70}I figured that granddaddy Colt
may blow into fragments...{\r}

1123
01:57:37,433 --> 01:57:40,197
就得崩成一块一块的了
{\fscx70\fscy70}...next time you try
to squeeze the trigger.{\r}

1124
01:57:40,436 --> 01:57:42,836
你也许说的对
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, you might have something there.{\r}

1125
01:57:43,338 --> 01:57:45,966
汤姆，饭好了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Tom, supper's ready.{\r}

1126
01:57:47,142 --> 01:57:49,167
马上来，亲爱的
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'll be right there, sweetheart.{\r}

1127
01:57:49,344 --> 01:57:51,642
我太兴奋了，都吃不下饭了
{\fscx70\fscy70}I might be too excited to eat.{\r}

1128
01:57:54,917 --> 01:57:57,408
你知道约翰・纽曼・爱德华兹
曾经怎么写我吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You know what John Newman Edwards
once wrote about me?{\r}

1129
01:57:58,454 --> 01:58:01,287
他说，给我一万个人
我只能找出两个能信任的人
{\fscx70\fscy70}He said I didn't trust
two men in 10,000...{\r}

1130
01:58:01,457 --> 01:58:04,119
就算和这俩人一起，我还是很警惕
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and even them I was cautious around.{\r}

1131
01:58:04,927 --> 01:58:06,918
政府长年追捕，让我疲惫不堪
{\fscx70\fscy70}Government's sort of run me ragged.{\r}

1132
01:58:08,897 --> 01:58:11,889
我绕着圈子说话呢
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm going the long way around the barn
to say that...{\r}

1133
01:58:12,067 --> 01:58:15,696
我是被追急了，最近有时故意刁难人
{\fscx70\fscy70}...I been feeling cornered
and just plain ornery as of late...{\r}

1134
01:58:16,438 --> 01:58:21,102
如果你能接受这把枪，接受我的歉意
我会很高兴的
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and I'd be pleased if you'd accept
that gun as my way of apologizing.{\r}

1135
01:58:23,479 --> 01:58:26,277
如果我是你，我大概会更加刁难人
{\fscx70\fscy70}Heaven knows I'd be ornerier
if I were in your position.{\r}

1136
01:58:26,448 --> 01:58:29,542
不，不，我的行为是不对的
{\fscx70\fscy70}No. No, I haven't been acting correctly.{\r}

1137
01:58:31,353 --> 01:58:34,880
我有时候都认不出自己了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Seems I hardly recognize myself
when I'm greased.{\r}

1138
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:40,451
我有时候灵魂出窍
{\fscx70\fscy70}I go on journeys out of my body...{\r}

1139
01:58:40,629 --> 01:58:44,725
看到自己这染血的手和凶恶的脸
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and look at my red hands
and my mean face...{\r}

1140
01:58:45,501 --> 01:58:49,232
看着这个做了那么多错事的人
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and I wonder about that man
that's gone so wrong.{\r}

1141
01:58:53,008 --> 01:58:56,034
我对自己来说，都已经成了一个麻烦
{\fscx70\fscy70}I've been becoming a problem to myself.{\r}

1142
01:59:08,690 --> 01:59:10,055
唉
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well...{\r}

1143
01:59:16,698 --> 01:59:21,328
- 该吃饭了，我去洗手
- 恩，去吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}- I better wash my hands if supper's on.
- Yeah, go ahead.{\r}

1144
01:59:34,683 --> 01:59:37,618
他死前一天是主进圣城节
{\fscx70\fscy70}The day before he died was Palm Sunday.{\r}

1145
01:59:38,654 --> 01:59:41,953
汤玛斯・霍华德先生和他的夫人，
还有他们的两个孩子
{\fscx70\fscy70}And Mr. And Mrs. Thomas Howard,
their two children...{\r}

1146
01:59:42,124 --> 01:59:44,183
还有他们的表亲查尔斯・约翰森
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and their cousin Charles Johnson...{\r}

1147
01:59:44,359 --> 01:59:49,524
到第二长老会教堂参加10点的礼拜
{\fscx70\fscy70}...strolled to the Second Presbyterian
Church to attend the 10:00 service.{\r}

1148
01:59:51,934 --> 01:59:54,232
鲍勃留在了屋里
{\fscx70\fscy70}Bob remained at the cottage...{\r}

1149
01:59:54,403 --> 01:59:57,804
偷偷地从一个房间，走到另一个房间
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and slyly migrated from room to room.{\r}

1150
02:00:00,409 --> 02:00:02,240
他走进主人房
{\fscx70\fscy70}He walked into the master bedroom...{\r}

1151
02:00:02,411 --> 02:00:06,177
把里面的衣服翻了一遍
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and inventoried the clothes
on the hangers and hooks.{\r}

1152
02:00:12,487 --> 02:00:15,820
拿起化妆台上的一杯水，喝了一口
{\fscx70\fscy70}He sipped from the water glass
on the vanity.{\r}

1153
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:22,426
闻了闻杰西枕套上的滑石粉和丁香花
{\fscx70\fscy70}He smelled the talcum and lilacs
on Jesse's pillowcase.{\r}

1154
02:00:30,339 --> 02:00:32,534
他的手指滑过自己的肋骨
{\fscx70\fscy70}His fingers skittered over his ribs...{\r}

1155
02:00:32,708 --> 02:00:36,576
想象上面像杰西那样，有两次中枪的伤疤
{\fscx70\fscy70}...to construe the scars
where Jesse was twice shot.{\r}

1156
02:00:40,382 --> 02:00:44,978
他把中指弄成上两个关节没了那样
{\fscx70\fscy70}He manufactured a middle finger
that was missing the top two knuckles.{\r}

1157
02:00:52,427 --> 02:00:55,362
想象自己34岁
{\fscx70\fscy70}He imagined himself at 34.{\r}

1158
02:00:57,366 --> 02:01:00,358
想象自己躺在了棺材里
{\fscx70\fscy70}He imagined himself in a coffin.{\r}

1159
02:01:02,437 --> 02:01:04,166
他想到各种各样
{\fscx70\fscy70}He considered possibilities...{\r}

1160
02:01:04,339 --> 02:01:07,638
即将成真的好事情
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and everything wonderful
that could come true.{\r}

1161
02:01:35,437 --> 02:01:37,371
他不会杀我们的
{\fscx70\fscy70}He's not gonna kill us.{\r}

1162
02:01:42,611 --> 02:01:44,772
他会的
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah, he is.{\r}

1163
02:01:47,082 --> 02:01:49,573
我会一直醒着，他就没法下手了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, I'll stay awake so he can't.{\r}

1164
02:02:02,931 --> 02:02:05,365
你在瞎想
{\fscx70\fscy70}You're imagining things.{\r}

1165
02:02:17,612 --> 02:02:19,580
不会去什么普拉特市
{\fscx70\fscy70}Ain't gonna be no Platte City.{\r}

1166
02:02:21,316 --> 02:02:23,944
杰西只是在耍我们
{\fscx70\fscy70}That's Jesse fooling with us.{\r}

1167
02:02:40,369 --> 02:02:42,599
睡吧，查理
{\fscx70\fscy70}Go to sleep, Charley.{\r}

1168
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:57,200
[1882年4月3日]

1169
02:03:16,204 --> 02:03:17,796
早
{\fscx70\fscy70}Morning.{\r}

1170
02:03:21,610 --> 02:03:23,134
查理
{\fscx70\fscy70}Charley.{\r}

1171
02:03:52,974 --> 02:03:55,408
鲍勃，你要吃多少？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Bob, how much did you want to eat?{\r}

1172
02:03:59,915 --> 02:04:02,349
我感觉有点怪怪的
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm feeling sort of peculiar.{\r}

1173
02:04:21,570 --> 02:04:24,038
为什么那么感兴趣地看着我们？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Why is it you're looking so interested?{\r}

1174
02:04:25,507 --> 02:04:28,408
你以为这样出去晃很聪明？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You think it's intelligent
to go out like that...{\r}

1175
02:04:28,577 --> 02:04:30,408
让大家都看见你的枪？
{\fscx70\fscy70}...so all creation can see your guns?{\r}

1176
02:04:48,163 --> 02:04:49,596
嗨
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hi.{\r}

1177
02:04:59,908 --> 02:05:02,809
来，看你妈妈在干吗
{\fscx70\fscy70}Come on, let's go see
what your mama's doing.{\r}

1178
02:05:03,945 --> 02:05:06,072
提米，开门
{\fscx70\fscy70}Timmy, get that door, would you?{\r}

1179
02:05:10,218 --> 02:05:13,381
- 你弄丢了一只鞋是吗，亲爱的
- 是啊
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Well, you lost your shoe, sweetheart.
- Yeah, I did.{\r}

1180
02:05:13,555 --> 02:05:17,685
那可麻烦了，商店也不单只卖呀
{\fscx70\fscy70}That's gonna be a problem.
They don't sell those one at a time.{\r}

1181
02:05:19,194 --> 02:05:21,253
我们丢了一只鞋，妈妈
{\fscx70\fscy70}We lost a shoe, Mama.{\r}

1182
02:05:22,864 --> 02:05:25,424
帮爸爸穿上，好吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Will you put that up for Daddy,
would you?{\r}

1183
02:05:28,503 --> 02:05:31,267
- 你在干吗，丢了一只鞋？
- 恩
{\fscx70\fscy70}- What you doing, you lose a shoe?
- Yeah.{\r}

1184
02:05:34,782 --> 02:05:38,488
[迪克・利都被逮捕，并已认罪]

1185
02:05:47,989 --> 02:05:51,390
只会往上，作为补充
{\fscx70\fscy70}It's only meant to go on top,
to complement.{\r}

1186
02:05:51,660 --> 02:05:53,491
我知道，有时候，我
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah, I know. Sometimes, l...{\r}

1187
02:06:18,086 --> 02:06:20,987
鲍勃，菜要凉了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Bob, everything's getting cold!{\r}

1188
02:06:21,690 --> 02:06:25,091
- 玛丽在哪里？
- 在外面，亲爱的
{\fscx70\fscy70}- Where's Mary?
- She's outside, darling.{\r}

1189
02:06:26,094 --> 02:06:27,891
玛丽？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Mary?{\r}

1190
02:06:31,666 --> 02:06:34,191
你说他那小脑瓜里都在想什么？
{\fscx70\fscy70}What do you think goes on
in that noggin of his?{\r}

1191
02:06:37,205 --> 02:06:38,900
没什么
{\fscx70\fscy70}Nothing.{\r}

1192
02:06:39,474 --> 02:06:42,272
我说的是他，不是你
{\fscx70\fscy70}I was talking about his mind, not yours.{\r}

1193
02:06:43,211 --> 02:06:44,940
哦，是啊
{\fscx70\fscy70}Oh, yeah.{\r}

1194
02:06:45,380 --> 02:06:47,075
哈，我明白
{\fscx70\fscy70}Oh, I get it.{\r}

1195
02:07:42,504 --> 02:07:44,472
啊哈
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, hello now.{\r}

1196
02:07:44,873 --> 02:07:47,899
“迪克・利都被逮捕，并已认罪”
{\fscx70\fscy70}"The arrest and confession
of Dick Liddil."{\r}

1197
02:07:53,148 --> 02:07:55,309
不是吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}You don't say so.{\r}

1198
02:08:09,631 --> 02:08:11,724
真怪了
{\fscx70\fscy70}That's very strange.{\r}

1199
02:08:12,167 --> 02:08:15,068
上面说迪克三星期前就投降了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Says here Dick surrendered
three weeks ago.{\r}

1200
02:08:15,236 --> 02:08:17,830
那时候你应该在那附近吧
{\fscx70\fscy70}You must have been
right in the neighborhood.{\r}

1201
02:08:18,506 --> 02:08:21,134
很明显，他们是秘密行动
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, apparently, they kept it a secret.{\r}

1202
02:08:32,353 --> 02:08:35,413
如果我短期内去堪萨斯市，会找人问问
{\fscx70\fscy70}If I get to Kansas City soon,
I'll ask somebody about it.{\r}

1203
02:09:16,097 --> 02:09:17,792
你俩准备好了吗
{\fscx70\fscy70}You two ready?{\r}

1204
02:09:21,503 --> 02:09:24,165
马上就好
{\fscx70\fscy70}I will be, by noon.{\r}

1205
02:09:57,071 --> 02:09:59,733
她要上船，航行出海
{\fscx70\fscy70}There is a ship
She sails the sea{\r}

1206
02:09:59,908 --> 02:10:02,672
她装了很多很多东西
{\fscx70\fscy70}She's loaded deep
As deep can be{\r}

1207
02:10:02,844 --> 02:10:05,074
但不及我对她的爱多
{\fscx70\fscy70}But not as deep
As the love I'm in{\r}

1208
02:10:05,647 --> 02:10:09,276
我不知道我是浮是沉
{\fscx70\fscy70}I know not if I sink or swim{\r}

1209
02:10:10,318 --> 02:10:12,013
海水广阔
{\fscx70\fscy70}The water is wide{\r}

1210
02:10:13,154 --> 02:10:19,718
我游不过，也没法翱翔而过
{\fscx70\fscy70}I can't cross o'er
And neither have I wings to fly{\r}

1211
02:10:20,161 --> 02:10:23,961
给我一只能载两个人的小船
{\fscx70\fscy70}Give me a boat
That can carry two{\r}

1212
02:10:24,132 --> 02:10:26,999
一起划船，我和我的爱人
{\fscx70\fscy70}Both shall row
My love and I{\r}

1213
02:10:27,168 --> 02:10:30,626
柔情款款
{\fscx70\fscy70}For love is gentle
And love is kind{\r}

1214
02:10:30,805 --> 02:10:33,797
如初开花蕾，芬芳扑鼻
{\fscx70\fscy70}Sweetest flower
When first it's new{\r}

1215
02:10:33,975 --> 02:10:37,570
但热情一旦冷却
{\fscx70\fscy70}But love grows old
And waxes cold{\r}

1216
02:10:37,745 --> 02:10:40,976
就像晨露一样枯萎
{\fscx70\fscy70}And fades away
Like the morning dew{\r}

1217
02:10:41,149 --> 02:10:44,175
她要上船，航行出海
{\fscx70\fscy70}There is a ship
She sails the sea{\r}

1218
02:10:44,352 --> 02:10:47,116
我该把枪拿下来
{\fscx70\fscy70}I guess I'll take my guns off...{\r}

1219
02:10:47,455 --> 02:10:49,446
别让邻居看到
{\fscx70\fscy70}...for fear the neighbors might spy them.{\r}

1220
02:11:22,757 --> 02:11:25,191
这画怎么那么多灰？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Don't that picture look dusty?{\r}

1221
02:13:07,295 --> 02:13:10,287
你…你做了什么？
{\fscx70\fscy70}What have...? What have you done?{\r}

1222

02:13:19,907 --> 02:13:20,931
杰西？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Jesse?{\r}

1224
02:13:22,076 --> 02:13:24,203
杰西？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Jesse? Jesse?{\r}

1225
02:13:24,946 --> 02:13:26,811
杰西！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Jesse!{\r}

1226
02:13:27,815 --> 02:13:29,908
不!
{\fscx70\fscy70}No!{\r}

1227
02:13:34,088 --> 02:13:36,420
别，杰西
{\fscx70\fscy70}No. Jess...{\r}

1228
02:13:37,025 --> 02:13:41,428
回来，回来
{\fscx70\fscy70}Come back. Oh, come back.{\r}

1229
02:13:43,564 --> 02:13:47,728
杰西，不要！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Oh, Jesse! No!{\r}

1230
02:13:48,236 --> 02:13:52,138
鲍勃，是你干的吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Oh, Bob. Have you done this?!{\r}

1231
02:13:52,340 --> 02:13:54,706
我向上帝发誓，我没有
{\fscx70\fscy70}I swear to God I didn't.{\r}

1232
02:13:55,710 --> 02:13:57,143
是场意外，芝
{\fscx70\fscy70}It was an accident, Zee.{\r}

1233
02:13:59,347 --> 02:14:02,714
枪走火了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Come on. Pistol went off accidentally.{\r}

1234
02:14:48,062 --> 02:14:49,256
[州长：我杀了杰西・詹姆斯]
写上我的名字
{\fscx70\fscy70}Put my name.{\r}

1235
02:14:49,430 --> 02:14:51,898
[州长：我杀了杰西・詹姆斯。罗伯特・福特]
你做什么了？我杀了他
{\fscx70\fscy70}Why, what'd you do? I shot him.{\r}

1236
02:14:59,107 --> 02:15:01,132
你大概会想留着它
{\fscx70\fscy70}You might wanna keep that.{\r}

1237
02:15:39,080 --> 02:15:41,173
谢谢
{\fscx70\fscy70}Thank you all very much.{\r}

1238
02:15:49,323 --> 02:15:51,814
照片以每张２美元的价钱卖出
{\fscx70\fscy70}The resulting prints
sold for 2 dollars apiece...{\r}

1239
02:15:51,993 --> 02:15:56,589
好些杂志拿来做了封面
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and were the models for the lithographed
covers on a number of magazines.{\r}

1240
02:16:02,136 --> 02:16:07,335
成千的陌生人像着了魔一样
来到这房子来朝圣
{\fscx70\fscy70}Soon a thousand strangers were making
spellbound pilgrimages to the cottage...{\r}

1241
02:16:07,708 --> 02:16:12,236
到森丹法邓的冷藏室去瞻仰
{\fscx70\fscy70}...or were venerating the iced remains
in Seidenfaden's cooling room.{\r}

1242
02:16:13,147 --> 02:16:17,641
有个人，曾经出价３万美元，想买下
刺杀加菲尔德・詹姆士总统那杀手的尸体
{\fscx70\fscy70}The man who offered 30,000 dollars for
the body of President Garfield's assassin...{\r}

1243
02:16:17,818 --> 02:16:21,720
他给该市警长克雷格打了个电报，出价５万
{\fscx70\fscy70}...sent a telegram to City Marshal
Enos Craig offering 50,000...{\r}

1244
02:16:21,889 --> 02:16:24,187
想买下杰西・詹姆斯的遗体
{\fscx70\fscy70}...for the body
of Jesse Woodson James...{\r}

1245
02:16:24,358 --> 02:16:27,122
准备全国展览
{\fscx70\fscy70}...so that he could go around the country
with it...{\r}

1246
02:16:29,530 --> 02:16:34,490
或者至少卖给P・T・巴纳姆，在其表演里展出
（美国著名游艺节目演出的经理人）
{\fscx70\fscy70}...or at least sell it to P.T. Barnum
for his Greatest Show on Earth.{\r}

1247
02:16:38,573 --> 02:16:41,667
另外一张照片，拍的是这位美国著名大盗
{\fscx70\fscy70}Another photograph was taken
of the renowned American bandit...{\r}

1248
02:16:41,842 --> 02:16:44,436
躺在冰床上
{\fscx70\fscy70}...nestled in his bed of ice.{\r}

1249
02:16:44,612 --> 02:16:48,878
这张照片在小店和药房等地方都大卖
{\fscx70\fscy70}And it was this shot that was most
available in sundries and apothecaries...{\r}

1250
02:16:49,050 --> 02:16:52,713
大家透过立体透镜来看这照片
就像看狮身人面像
{\fscx70\fscy70}...to be viewed in a stereoscope
alongside the sphinx...{\r}

1251
02:16:52,887 --> 02:16:56,880
泰姬陵和罗马的地下墓室
这些名胜古迹的照片一样
{\fscx70\fscy70}...the Taj Mahal,
and the catacombs of Rome.{\r}

1252
02:17:22,083 --> 02:17:24,051
看啊
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hello, here!{\r}

1253
02:17:24,252 --> 02:17:26,846
“迪克・利都被逮捕，并已认罪”
{\fscx70\fscy70}"The arrest and confession
of Dick Liddil."{\r}

1254
02:17:27,021 --> 02:17:32,152
年轻人，你跟我说过
不知道迪克投降了是吧？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Young man, I thought you told me
you didn't know Dick had surrendered.{\r}

1255
02:17:32,326 --> 02:17:36,194
真的吗？我不知道
{\fscx70\fscy70}You mean he did? I didn't know.{\r}

1256
02:17:37,098 --> 02:17:38,998
但我知道我骗不了他
{\fscx70\fscy70}But I knew I had not fooled him.{\r}

1257
02:17:39,166 --> 02:17:43,000
他和我一样心知肚明，那一刻我准备
把他绳之于法
{\fscx70\fscy70}And he knew, as well as I, in that moment
that I intended to bring him to justice.{\r}

1258
02:17:43,938 --> 02:17:47,499
但他不会当着他老婆孩子的面杀我
{\fscx70\fscy70}But he would not kill me
in the presence of his wife and children.{\r}

1259
02:17:47,675 --> 02:17:50,906
所以他笑了，好让我放松警惕
{\fscx70\fscy70}And so he was smiling
to throw me off-guard.{\r}

1260
02:17:54,148 --> 02:17:56,810
哦，对阿，鲍勃
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, it's all right, anyway, Bob.{\r}

1261
02:17:58,686 --> 02:18:01,587
大家都认为，鲍勃相当具有戏剧天赋
{\fscx70\fscy70}It was widely felt that
Bob possessed some acting talent...{\r}

1262
02:18:01,756 --> 02:18:04,020
而查理则一点天分都没有
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and Charley, not a jot.{\r}

1263
02:18:04,191 --> 02:18:07,126
这画怎么那么多灰呀
{\fscx70\fscy70}That picture's awful dusty.{\r}

1264
02:18:07,928 --> 02:18:11,056
大家希望查理不要那么垂头丧气，喃喃自语
{\fscx70\fscy70}Charley was only expected
not to slouch or mutter...{\r}

1265
02:18:11,232 --> 02:18:15,896
不要把这种心情传给观众
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and to transport his sicknesses
to the alley before letting them go.{\r}

1266
02:18:45,299 --> 02:18:47,164
就这样
{\fscx70\fscy70}And that's...{\r}

1267
02:18:47,735 --> 02:18:50,397
我杀了杰西・詹姆斯
{\fscx70\fscy70}...how I killed Jesse James.{\r}

1268
02:18:53,874 --> 02:18:57,401
到了1883年3月，认得鲍勃・福特的人
{\fscx70\fscy70}By October of 1883, Bob Ford
could be identified correctly...{\r}

1269
02:18:57,578 --> 02:19:01,844
已经比认得美国总统的人多了
{\fscx70\fscy70}...by more citizens than could
the president of the United States.{\r}

1270
02:19:02,516 --> 02:19:07,249
年仅20岁，他已经非常出名，可以媲美
杰西犯了14年偷窃罪所累积出来的名气
{\fscx70\fscy70}He was as renowned at 20 as Jesse was
after 14 years of grand larceny.{\r}

1271
02:19:07,421 --> 02:19:09,616
你不会勾引到我的
{\fscx70\fscy70}You won't get your hooks into me.{\r}

1272
02:19:10,157 --> 02:19:14,890
对了，这就对了，坐到你男朋友边上，吉贝尔
{\fscx70\fscy70}That's right. That's right.
Sit next to your boyfriend. Jezebel.{\r}

1273
02:19:15,062 --> 02:19:17,155
查理变得越发的迷信
{\fscx70\fscy70}Charley was increasingly superstitious...{\r}

1274
02:19:17,331 --> 02:19:20,027
越发相信占卜者的建议
{\fscx70\fscy70}...increasingly subject
to the advice of soothsayers...{\r}

1275
02:19:20,201 --> 02:19:24,228
占卜者声称能用烟斗和糊药治愈他的悲伤
{\fscx70\fscy70}...who promised to cure his miseries
with pipe smoke and poultices.{\r}

1276
02:19:24,405 --> 02:19:27,670
你见吉普赛人见得太多了，查理
{\fscx70\fscy70}You been spending too much time
with Gypsies, Charley.{\r}

1277
02:19:33,381 --> 02:19:34,746
靠
{\fscx70\fscy70}Shit.{\r}

1278
02:19:39,086 --> 02:19:41,646
这照片怎么那么多灰
{\fscx70\fscy70}The picture's awful dusty.{\r}

1279
02:19:42,089 --> 02:19:45,923
查理对杰西的演绎方式发生了变化
{\fscx70\fscy70}Something began to change
in Charley's stage portrayal of Jesse.{\r}

1280
02:19:46,093 --> 02:19:48,618
他的步态显得更娴熟
{\fscx70\fscy70}His gait seemed more practiced.{\r}

1281
02:19:48,796 --> 02:19:52,095
声音越发和那人相似，让人毛骨悚然
{\fscx70\fscy70}His voice was spookily similar
to the man's.{\r}

1282
02:19:52,266 --> 02:19:54,666
他新加入了一些对话
{\fscx70\fscy70}His newly suggested dialogue
was analogous...{\r}

1283
02:19:54,835 --> 02:19:57,861
仿佛出自杰西的创造
{\fscx70\fscy70}...to a script Jesse might have originated.{\r}

1284
02:20:00,674 --> 02:20:03,108
他开始用蔑视的眼神注视他的弟弟
{\fscx70\fscy70}He began to look at his younger brother
with spite...{\r}

1285
02:20:03,277 --> 02:20:05,905
仿佛他疑心，在以后的演出里
{\fscx70\fscy70}...as if he suspected that
in some future performance...{\r}

1286
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:10,608
他将面对罗伯特・福特的真枪实弹
{\fscx70\fscy70}...he might present himself
to a live cartridge in Robert Ford's gun.{\r}

1287
02:20:11,952 --> 02:20:13,783
杀人犯！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Murderer!{\r}

1288
02:20:14,121 --> 02:20:15,850
杂种！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Cur!{\r}

1289
02:20:16,490 --> 02:20:18,253
懦夫！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Coward!{\r}

1290
02:20:21,796 --> 02:20:26,324
你想看我有多大的胆子是吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You wanna investigate my courage?
Do you?{\r}

1291
02:20:26,734 --> 02:20:30,500
来啊！来啊！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Find out! Find out!{\r}

1292
02:20:35,142 --> 02:20:37,007
没人来
{\fscx70\fscy70}Nobody.{\r}

1293
02:20:51,592 --> 02:20:53,389
懦夫！
{\fscx70\fscy70}Coward!{\r}

1294
02:21:18,586 --> 02:21:24,149
据他自己估计
鲍勃谋杀了杰西・詹姆斯800多次
{\fscx70\fscy70}By his own approximation, Bob
assassinated Jesse James over 800 times.{\r}

1295
02:21:24,325 --> 02:21:28,091
他猜，历史上没有任何人
曾这样频繁，或如此公开地
{\fscx70\fscy70}He suspected no one in history
had ever so often or so publicly...{\r}

1296
02:21:28,262 --> 02:21:31,459
重演一次背叛的行为
{\fscx70\fscy70}...recapitulated an act of betrayal.{\r}

1297
02:21:36,670 --> 02:21:39,434
鲍勃经常挑战对于懦夫的定义
{\fscx70\fscy70}Bob always challenged
the allegations of cowardice...{\r}

1298
02:21:39,607 --> 02:21:42,542
但查理似乎认同这些定义
{\fscx70\fscy70}...but Charley seemed
to agree with them.{\r}

1299
02:21:42,810 --> 02:21:46,576
他提起芝・詹姆斯太太的时候
把她说得像圣母一样
{\fscx70\fscy70}He spoke of Mrs. Zee James
as certain priests might the Madonna...{\r}

1300
02:21:46,747 --> 02:21:49,841
还给她写了许多发自肺腑的长信
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and composed long soul-describing letters
to her...{\r}

1301
02:21:50,017 --> 02:21:52,212
请求她的原谅
{\fscx70\fscy70}...begging her forgiveness...{\r}

1302
02:21:53,521 --> 02:21:56,115
但这些信从未寄出过
{\fscx70\fscy70}...none of which he mailed.{\r}

1303
02:22:23,984 --> 02:22:29,581
大家觉得，暗杀了杰西・詹姆斯的人
下场就该和查理・福特一样
{\fscx70\fscy70}Charley Ford became all that his countrymen
wanted an assassin of Jesse James to be.{\r}

1304
02:22:33,861 --> 02:22:39,731
杰西・詹姆斯杀了很多人
{\fscx70\fscy70}Jesse James was a man
Who killed many men{\r}

1305
02:22:40,935 --> 02:22:45,372
他抢了格伦代尔火车
{\fscx70\fscy70}He robbed the Glendale train{\r}

1306
02:22:45,606 --> 02:22:51,442
他劫富济贫
{\fscx70\fscy70}And he stole from the rich
And he gave to the poor{\r}

1307
02:22:51,679 --> 02:22:56,616
他身手敏捷，头脑机灵
{\fscx70\fscy70}He had a hand
And a heart and a brain{\r}

1308
02:22:57,418 --> 02:23:02,913
杰西有个妻子，她会为他哀悼
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, Jesse had a wife
To mourn for his life{\r}

1309
02:23:03,090 --> 02:23:08,187
还有三个勇敢的儿女
{\fscx70\fscy70}Three children
They were brave{\r}

1310
02:23:08,362 --> 02:23:13,959
但那个肮脏的懦夫，射杀了霍华德先生
{\fscx70\fscy70}But that dirty little coward
Who shot Mr. Howard{\r}

1311
02:23:14,201 --> 02:23:19,264
让杰西・詹姆斯进了棺材
{\fscx70\fscy70}Has laid Jesse James in his grave{\r}

1312
02:23:20,341 --> 02:23:25,335
罗伯特・福特，这肮脏的小懦夫
{\fscx70\fscy70}It was Robert Ford
That dirty little coward{\r}

1313
02:23:26,080 --> 02:23:30,483
我想知道他的感受
{\fscx70\fscy70}I wonder how does he feel{\r}

1314
02:23:30,651 --> 02:23:36,385
他吃杰西的饭，睡杰西的床
{\fscx70\fscy70}For he ate at Jesse's bread
And he slept in Jesse's bed{\r}

1315
02:23:36,557 --> 02:23:41,585
却让可怜的杰西进了棺材
{\fscx70\fscy70}And he laid poor Jesse in his grave{\r}

1316
02:23:42,062 --> 02:23:47,591
杰西有个妻子，她会为他哀悼
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, Jesse had a wife
To mourn for his life{\r}

1317
02:23:47,768 --> 02:23:52,671
还有三个勇敢的儿女
{\fscx70\fscy70}Three children
They were brave{\r}

1318
02:23:52,840 --> 02:23:58,472
但那个肮脏的懦夫，射杀了霍华德先生
{\fscx70\fscy70}But that dirty little coward
Who shot Mr. Howard{\r}

1319
02:23:58,646 --> 02:24:02,810
让可怜的杰西进了棺材
{\fscx70\fscy70}Has laid poor Jesse in his grave{\r}

1320
02:24:14,361 --> 02:24:16,386
我就是罗伯特・福特
{\fscx70\fscy70}I'm Robert Ford.{\r}

1321
02:24:27,107 --> 02:24:30,838
是两个孩子，不是三个
{\fscx70\fscy70}It was two children, not three.{\r}

1322
02:24:42,222 --> 02:24:43,553
嘿
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hey.{\r}

1323
02:24:44,458 --> 02:24:47,018
回家去，好吗
{\fscx70\fscy70}You get yourself home, son, okay?{\r}

1324
02:24:47,728 --> 02:24:51,755
出去，滚出我的地方
{\fscx70\fscy70}Come on. Get out of here.
Get out of my place.{\r}

1325
02:25:23,530 --> 02:25:25,725
他生气极了的时候
{\fscx70\fscy70}He thought, at his angriest...{\r}

1326
02:25:25,899 --> 02:25:29,665
会想去见杰西杀害的人的家属
{\fscx70\fscy70}...about visiting the kin
of Jesse's slaughtered victims:{\r}

1327
02:25:31,638 --> 02:25:34,903
普拉茨堡的威廉太太
{\fscx70\fscy70}Mrs. William Westfall in Plattsburg...{\r}

1328
02:25:37,411 --> 02:25:40,505
克莱县的崴墨一家
{\fscx70\fscy70}...the Wymore family in Clay County...{\r}

1329
02:25:45,652 --> 02:25:49,952
甚至是马萨诸塞州北田的
约瑟夫・黑伍德的遗孀
{\fscx70\fscy70}...perhaps even Mrs. Joseph Heywood
in Northfield, Minnesota.{\r}

1330
02:25:53,026 --> 02:25:56,018
他想到这些人的家里
告诉他们他叫罗伯特・詹姆斯
{\fscx70\fscy70}He would go to their homes
and give his name as Robert Ford...{\r}

1331
02:25:56,196 --> 02:25:59,165
告诉他们他杀了杰西・詹姆斯
{\fscx70\fscy70}...the man who killed Jesse James.{\r}

1332
02:26:00,601 --> 02:26:03,661
他想象他们会对他充满感激之情
{\fscx70\fscy70}He imagined they would
be grateful to him.{\r}

1333
02:26:54,621 --> 02:26:59,615
他只对多莱西・伊凡思坦白道出了真相
{\fscx70\fscy70}It was only with Dorothy Evans
that Bob spoke revealingly or plainly...{\r}

1334
02:26:59,793 --> 02:27:04,230
告诉她一些他以前都不知道自己知道的事情
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and it was with her that he spoke of
things he didn't know he knew.{\r}

1335
02:27:25,886 --> 02:27:29,947
他告诉她，他对射杀和后事都没有真实的记忆
{\fscx70\fscy70}He told her that he had no real memory
of the shooting and its aftermath.{\r}

1336
02:27:30,123 --> 02:27:33,991
他只记得，举起了那把杰西给他的枪
{\fscx70\fscy70}He could remember lifting the gun
that Jesse had given him...{\r}

1337
02:27:34,728 --> 02:27:38,755
然后就到耶稣受难日了，他看到了葬礼安排
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and then it was Good Friday and he was
reading about the funeral proceedings...{\r}

1338
02:27:38,932 --> 02:27:41,457
仿佛事情已经过去了很久
{\fscx70\fscy70}...as if they'd happened a long time ago.{\r}

1339
02:27:43,036 --> 02:27:45,163
你为什么杀了他？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Why did you kill him?{\r}

1340
02:27:49,476 --> 02:27:51,501
他要杀我
{\fscx70\fscy70}Well, he was gonna kill me.{\r}

1341
02:27:56,717 --> 02:27:59,948
那唯一的原因就是你害怕了？
{\fscx70\fscy70}So you were scared
and that's the only reason?{\r}

1342
02:28:02,689 --> 02:28:04,088
对
{\fscx70\fscy70}Yeah.{\r}

1343
02:28:04,558 --> 02:28:06,617
还有赏金
{\fscx70\fscy70}And the reward money.{\r}

1344
02:28:12,432 --> 02:28:15,230
你想我换个话题吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}Do you want me to change the subject?{\r}

1345
02:28:23,443 --> 02:28:25,775
你知道我曾经期待什么吗？
{\fscx70\fscy70}You know what I expected?{\r}

1346
02:28:26,813 --> 02:28:28,804
掌声
{\fscx70\fscy70}Applause.{\r}

1347
02:28:31,385 --> 02:28:35,549
我那时候才20岁，我不知道别人会怎么看
{\fscx70\fscy70}I was only 20 years old then.
I couldn't see how it would look to people.{\r}

1348
02:28:39,660 --> 02:28:42,322
事情竟变成这样，我很吃惊
{\fscx70\fscy70}I was surprised by what happened.{\r}

1349
02:28:43,397 --> 02:28:45,365
他们没有鼓掌
{\fscx70\fscy70}They didn't applaud.{\r}

1350
02:28:48,802 --> 02:28:50,667
他为自己的吹嘘
{\fscx70\fscy70}He was ashamed of his boasting...{\r}

1351
02:28:50,837 --> 02:28:53,704
自己假装的勇敢无畏而感到羞耻
{\fscx70\fscy70}...his pretensions of courage
and ruthlessness.{\r}

1352
02:28:54,007 --> 02:28:57,773
他为自己的冷血无情
{\fscx70\fscy70}He was sorry about his cold-bloodedness,
his dispassion...{\r}

1353
02:28:59,413 --> 02:29:03,816
为自己无法表达自己真实的感情而充满愧疚
{\fscx70\fscy70}...his inability to express
what he now believed was the case:{\r}

1354
02:29:06,386 --> 02:29:09,412
他很后悔杀了杰西
{\fscx70\fscy70}That he truly regretted killing Jesse...{\r}

1355
02:29:10,190 --> 02:29:13,182
他非常想念他
{\fscx70\fscy70}...that he missed the man
as much as anybody...{\r}

1356
02:29:13,727 --> 02:29:16,855
他希望，他不是非要杀了杰西来保命
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and wished his murder
hadn't been necessary.{\r}

1357
02:29:36,316 --> 02:29:38,409
即使当他在自己的酒吧里穿行
{\fscx70\fscy70}Even as he circulated his saloon...{\r}

1358
02:29:38,585 --> 02:29:42,351
他也知道他走过之后，这些人的笑容就会消失
{\fscx70\fscy70}...he knew that the smiles disappeared
when he passed by.{\r}

1359
02:29:43,457 --> 02:29:45,288
他收到很多很多恶意信件
{\fscx70\fscy70}He received so many menacing letters...{\r}

1360
02:29:45,459 --> 02:29:48,895
到最后他读的时候除了好奇，就没有别的反应了
{\fscx70\fscy70}...that he could read them
without any reaction except curiosity.{\r}

1361
02:29:52,699 --> 02:29:57,500
他整天呆在屋里，翻着扑克牌
{\fscx70\fscy70}He kept to his apartment all day,
flipping over playing cards...{\r}

1362
02:29:59,006 --> 02:30:03,500
在每张K和J牌里注视自己的命运
{\fscx70\fscy70}...looking at his destiny
in every king and jack.{\r}

1363
02:30:07,714 --> 02:30:12,014
8号下午1点，爱德华・奥凯利来了
{\fscx70\fscy70}Edward O'Kelly came up from Bachelor
at 1 p.m. On the 8th.{\r}

1364
02:30:13,487 --> 02:30:17,423
他没有什么大计，没有策略
{\fscx70\fscy70}He had no grand scheme, no strategy...{\r}

1365
02:30:17,591 --> 02:30:19,991
没有和警方订任何协议
{\fscx70\fscy70}...no agreement with higher authorities...{\r}

1366
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:22,924
心里只是暗暗期待着荣誉
{\fscx70\fscy70}...nothing beyond
a vague longing for glory...{\r}

1367
02:30:23,997 --> 02:30:28,263
和向罗伯特・福特报复的心情
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and a generalized wish
for revenge against Robert Ford.{\r}

1368
02:30:36,043 --> 02:30:39,308
- 昨晚怎样？
- 不坏
{\fscx70\fscy70}- How'd it go last night?
- Not so bad.{\r}

1369
02:30:42,549 --> 02:30:43,948
另一支
{\fscx70\fscy70}The other one.{\r}

1370
02:30:46,453 --> 02:30:49,217
爱德华・奥凯利将因二级谋杀
{\fscx70\fscy70}Edward O'Kelly would be ordered
to serve a life sentence...{\r}

1371
02:30:49,389 --> 02:30:52,290
在科罗拉多惩戒所被判终身监禁
{\fscx70\fscy70}...in the Colorado Penitentiary
for second-degree murder.{\r}

1372
02:30:52,459 --> 02:30:55,223
最终，超过7000人签名
{\fscx70\fscy70}Over 7000 signatures
would eventually be gathered...{\r}

1373
02:30:55,395 --> 02:30:57,659
请求释放奥凯利
{\fscx70\fscy70}...on a petition asking for
O'Kelly's release...{\r}

1374
02:30:57,831 --> 02:31:02,825
1902年，州长詹姆斯・B・奥曼将其释放
{\fscx70\fscy70}...and in 1902, Governor James B. Orman
would pardon the man.{\r}

1375
02:31:03,437 --> 02:31:07,840
你不应该戴那个领带夹的，蛋白石不吉祥
{\fscx70\fscy70}You shouldn't be wearing that stickpin
again there, Bob. Opals are unlucky.{\r}

1376
02:31:09,276 --> 02:31:13,474
我运气本身也不好
蛋白石可能还能给我转运呢
{\fscx70\fscy70}My luck's not very good as it is. I don't
think an opal's gonna change that much.{\r}

1377
02:31:14,414 --> 02:31:15,847
我听到了
{\fscx70\fscy70}I hear you.{\r}

1378
02:31:29,429 --> 02:31:31,294
没有人会给鲍勃念颂词
{\fscx70\fscy70}There would be no eulogies for Bob...{\r}

1379
02:31:32,999 --> 02:31:37,095
杂货店也不会卖他遗体的照片
{\fscx70\fscy70}...no photographs of his body
would be sold in sundries stores...{\r}

1380
02:31:37,804 --> 02:31:42,173
没有人会在雨天涌到街上去看他的葬礼行列
{\fscx70\fscy70}...no people would crowd the streets
in the rain to see his funeral cortege...{\r}

1381
02:31:43,910 --> 02:31:46,879
没人会给他写传记
{\fscx70\fscy70}...no biographies would be written
about him...{\r}

1382
02:31:47,047 --> 02:31:49,607
没有人会给孩子起他的名字
{\fscx70\fscy70}...no children named after him.{\r}

1383
02:31:51,184 --> 02:31:55,917
没有人会付25美分去看他长大的那个屋子
{\fscx70\fscy70}No one would ever pay 25 cents
to stand in the rooms he grew up in.{\r}

1384
02:32:00,460 --> 02:32:02,189
你好啊，鲍勃
{\fscx70\fscy70}Hello, Bob.{\r}

1385
02:32:03,630 --> 02:32:07,828
枪声响起，艾拉・梅会尖叫
{\fscx70\fscy70}The shotgun would ignite,
and Ella Mae would scream...{\r}

1386
02:32:08,635 --> 02:32:12,298
但罗伯特・福特只会躺在地板上
盯着天花板
{\fscx70\fscy70}...but Robert Ford would only lay
on the floor and look at the ceiling...{\r}

1387
02:32:12,472 --> 02:32:14,963
他的眼睛逐渐失去光彩
{\fscx70\fscy70}...the light going out of his eyes...{\r}

1388
02:32:15,142 --> 02:32:17,872
他没想到该说什么话
{\fscx70\fscy70}...before he could find the right words.{\r}

1389
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:33,200
片名：神枪手之死

1390
02:32:34,200 --> 02:39:39,200
