1
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,717
He was growing into middle age...

2
00:01:13,889 --> 00:01:17,416
...and was living then in a bungalow
on Woodland Avenue.

3
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:21,523
He installed himself in a rocking chair...

4
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:23,756
...and smoked a cigar down
in the evenings...

5
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:26,833
...as his wife wiped her pink hands
on an apron...

6
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:30,199
...and reported happily
on their two children.

7
00:01:36,144 --> 00:01:37,702
His children knew his legs...

8
00:01:38,013 --> 00:01:41,210
...the sting of his mustache
against their cheeks.

9
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:47,215
They didn't know how their father made
his living or why they so often moved.

10
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,857
They didn't even know
their father's name.

11
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:57,029
He was listed in the city directory
as Thomas Howard.

12
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,631
And he went everywhere unrecognized...

13
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:02,861
...and lunched with Kansas City
shopkeepers and merchants...

14
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:06,397
...calling himself a cattleman
or a commodities investor...

15
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:10,870
...someone rich and leisured
who had the common touch.

16
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:17,418
He had two incompletely healed
bullet holes in his chest...

17
00:02:17,586 --> 00:02:19,144
...and another in his thigh.

18
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:21,846
He was missing the nub
of his left middle finger...

19
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:25,255
...and was cautious,
lest that mutilation be seen.

20
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:30,760
He also had a condition that was
referred to as "granulated eyelids"...

21
00:02:30,932 --> 00:02:33,924
...and it caused him
to blink more than usual...

22
00:02:34,703 --> 00:02:38,833
...as if he found creation
slightly more than he could accept.

23
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:43,036
Rooms seemed hotter
when he was in them.

24
00:02:43,512 --> 00:02:45,241
Rains fell straighter.

25
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:47,178
Clocks slowed.

26
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:50,113
Sounds were amplified.

27
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:54,017
He considered himself
a Southern loyalist and guerrilla...

28
00:02:54,189 --> 00:02:57,158
...in a Civil War that never ended.

29
00:02:57,325 --> 00:03:02,695
He regretted neither his robberies,
nor the 17 murders that he laid claim to.

30
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:13,435
He had seen another summer under
in Kansas City, Missouri...

31
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:17,908
...and on September 5th
in the year 1881...

32
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:21,709
...he was 34 years old.

33
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:32,425
You just... You just slide them things
right in there, right in your sleeve...

34
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:35,620
...and then, when you get ready,
you just shake it out.

35
00:03:35,797 --> 00:03:38,129
Like that, right there. You shake it out.

36
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:45,666
Mary Todd Lincoln, tyrant's wife, fall
into hysterics when the moon was full.

37
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:48,401
President's men would tie her up
with hay-baling wire...

38
00:03:48,577 --> 00:03:50,772
...keep her from ripping
her husband's ears off.

39
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:55,440
You never heard word one about the wife of
the Confederacy's Jefferson Davis, did you?

40
00:03:55,617 --> 00:03:56,914
- I didn't.
- No, you didn't.

41
00:03:57,686 --> 00:04:00,018
He did his duty by her.

42
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:04,915
- Oh, my God, I'm speaking to children.
- No, I get it, I get it, I get it.

43
00:04:05,093 --> 00:04:09,291
The president of the Confederacy discerned
his wife's needs and satisfied them...

44
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,092
...with the utmost skill
and the utmost courtesy.

45
00:04:15,904 --> 00:04:19,362
- Charley, you spit all over my boot.
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry, Jesse.

46
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:22,499
- Here, get it off.
- I'll wipe it... I'll wipe it off.

47
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:27,040
But Abraham Lincoln probably sent his wife
on a shopping expedition.

48
00:04:27,215 --> 00:04:30,981
- A three-act play.
- With money stole from us.

49
00:04:32,053 --> 00:04:33,987
Chow!

50
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,817
I think insanity run on both sides
of that Lincoln family.

51
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:41,895
You're right about that.

52
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:44,657
The river... You jump in the river.

53
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:50,195
- Chow!
- Don't be shy now, Dick.

54
00:04:50,472 --> 00:04:52,804
- One more piece of meat.
- When you diddle a lot...

55
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:55,465
There's a good piece of bacon fat
in there for him.

56
00:05:30,845 --> 00:05:32,437
Excuse me.

57
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:36,576
I see I've traipsed right on in
and interrupted you.

58
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,615
Who are you, then?

59
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:43,121
Bob Ford.

60
00:05:44,526 --> 00:05:45,754
Charley's brother?

61
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:48,628
Yeah.

62
00:06:02,777 --> 00:06:05,974
I was lying when I said
I just happened down here.

63
00:06:06,147 --> 00:06:10,413
I've been looking for you. I feel lousy
I didn't say so at the outset.

64
00:06:12,988 --> 00:06:14,580
Folks take me for a nincompoop...

65
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:18,487
...on account of the shabby first impression
I make, whereas I think of myself...

66
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,094
...as being just a rung down
from the James brothers.

67
00:06:21,997 --> 00:06:24,932
I was hoping if I ran into you
aside from those peckerwoods...

68
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,161
...I could show you how special I am.

69
00:06:40,615 --> 00:06:44,608
I honestly believe I'm destined
for great things, Mr. James.

70
00:06:44,786 --> 00:06:49,120
I got qualities that don't come shining
through right at the outset.

71
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:54,956
You give me a chance, I'll get
the job done. I guarantee you that.

72
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:02,465
Hey, Dick, is it true you diddled a squaw?

73
00:07:04,706 --> 00:07:08,938
Come on, you can tell me. I've always
wanted to lay down with a redskin.

74
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:10,944
Well, Charley...

75
00:07:12,414 --> 00:07:15,850
...there's a feeling that comes over you...

76
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:19,680
...getting inside a woman whose hands
has scalped a congregation.

77
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:22,687
There's this thunderous sound
that comes from their cooch...

78
00:07:22,857 --> 00:07:26,122
...on account of the fact that
they birth a child standing upright...

79
00:07:26,294 --> 00:07:29,286
...like a wild animal.
- What's it sound like?

80
00:07:29,464 --> 00:07:33,730
Whatever a thunderous cooch sounds like
there, Charley. I don't know.

81
00:07:34,336 --> 00:07:35,735
No.

82
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:38,304
They got a noisy quim
on account of the fact that...

83
00:07:38,473 --> 00:07:43,376
...they use their cunnis as a saddlebag
to carry sundries across the plains.

84
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:47,442
Come on, what'd it really feel like?
Did it feel good?

85
00:07:47,615 --> 00:07:50,015
Come on, fess up, now.

86
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:52,085
I like you, Charley.

87
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:55,683
I like you too, Charley.

88
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:57,148
Well...

89
00:07:59,194 --> 00:08:01,185
You're not so special, Mr. Ford.

90
00:08:02,197 --> 00:08:06,065
You're just like any other tyro
who's prinked himself up for an escapade.

91
00:08:06,234 --> 00:08:10,068
Hoping to be a gunslinger
like them nickel books are about.

92
00:08:11,072 --> 00:08:13,939
You may as well quench your mind of it...

93
00:08:15,176 --> 00:08:18,202
...because you don't have
the ingredients, son.

94
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:35,760
Well, I'm sorry to hear
you feel that way...

95
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,127
...as I put such stock
in your opinions.

96
00:08:44,305 --> 00:08:48,401
As for me being a gunslinger, I've just got
this one granddaddy Paterson Colt...

97
00:08:48,576 --> 00:08:51,044
...and a borrowed belt to stick it in.

98
00:08:51,212 --> 00:08:54,545
But I also got an appetite
for greater things.

99
00:08:57,786 --> 00:09:01,813
I hoped by joining up with you, it'd put me
that much closer to getting them.

100
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:07,387
Well, what am I supposed to say to that?

101
00:09:09,764 --> 00:09:11,459
Let me be your sidekick tonight.

102
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:12,759
Sidekick?

103
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:15,061
So you can examine my grit
and intelligence.

104
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:16,931
I don't know what it is about you...

105
00:09:17,105 --> 00:09:20,165
...but the more you talk,
the more you give me the willies.

106
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:24,237
Now, I don't believe I want you anywhere
within earshot this evening, okay?

107
00:09:24,412 --> 00:09:25,902
You understand?

108
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:33,451
- Well, I'm sorry...
- Why don't you just get now? Scat.

109
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:40,719
All right.

110
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:47,026
I was with a girl once, wasn't a squaw.

111
00:09:47,202 --> 00:09:49,067
But she was pretty.

112
00:09:49,437 --> 00:09:53,806
She had yellow hair like a...

113
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,375
Oh, like something.

114
00:09:57,645 --> 00:10:00,512
Like hair bobbed from a ray of sunlight?

115
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:03,617
Yeah. Yeah, like that.

116
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:06,981
Boy, you... You talk good.

117
00:10:07,155 --> 00:10:09,817
You can hide things in vocabulary.

118
00:10:11,793 --> 00:10:16,355
Maybe you and me could write her a note,
send it by post?

119
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:18,226
See, all you gotta do, Ed...

120
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,698
...is predict her needs
and beat her to the punch.

121
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:27,637
Well, this girl, she has a real specific job.

122
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:30,734
- Specific?
- We was only together once.

123
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:32,174
She...

124
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:37,409
She was afraid of lightning,
and she came up under the wagon and...

125
00:10:37,585 --> 00:10:40,520
...just cuddled right up to me.

126
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:42,656
She give me a kind price too.

127
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:48,719
Well, I'll be. That is specific.

128
00:10:51,432 --> 00:10:53,730
Yeah, sure,
she'd been with other people...

129
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:55,961
...but the kind of things she said to me...

130
00:10:56,137 --> 00:10:59,265
...people just don't say
unless they really mean it.

131
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,506
My love said she would marry only me

132
00:11:03,378 --> 00:11:06,404
And Jove himself could not make her care.

133
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:09,175
For what women say to lovers, you'll agree

134
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,446
One writes on running water or on air.

135
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:18,518
My God, that's good.
Let's write her that.

136
00:11:19,527 --> 00:11:21,154
No.

137
00:11:21,462 --> 00:11:23,862
Poetry don't work on whores.

138
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:29,026
How do you do?

139
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:33,532
Am I too late
to wish you a happy birthday?

140
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,372
How'd you know?

141
00:11:37,946 --> 00:11:40,210
You'd be surprised
at what I got stored away.

142
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:42,975
I'm an authority on the James boys.

143
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:44,618
Is you?

144
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:50,849
Well... Well, your brother Frank and I,
we just had a real nice visit.

145
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:55,189
Just chit-chatting about this and that,
right over there.

146
00:11:55,597 --> 00:11:58,498
And must've been a hundred subjects
entertained...

147
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,032
Good Lord, you know
what this stew needs?

148
00:12:05,707 --> 00:12:07,334
Dumplings?

149
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:09,271
Noodles.

150
00:12:09,644 --> 00:12:13,011
You eat yourself some noodle stew
and your clock'll tick all night.

151
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:17,049
You ever see that woman up in Fayette?
Suck noodles up her nose.

152
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,615
- In Fayette?
- I don't believe I have.

153
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:23,120
You never heard of her, huh?

154
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:26,621
You got canals up there
you never dreamed of.

155
00:12:30,798 --> 00:12:32,493
I don't like to harp on a subject...

156
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:35,261
I don't care who comes with me.
Never have.

157
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:38,030
That's why they call me gregarious.

158
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:42,672
I hear you and young Stovepipe here
had a real nice visit.

159
00:12:43,144 --> 00:12:47,171
Your boys have got about a acre
of lumber to haul, dingus.

160
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:49,846
You better goose them down yonder.

161
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:04,293
The James Gang committed over 25 bank,
train and stagecoach robberies...

162
00:13:04,465 --> 00:13:07,901
...from 1867 to 1881.

163
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:10,862
But except for Frank and Jesse James...

164
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,169
...all the original members
were now either dead or in prison.

165
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:20,174
- Mine eye
All my soul and all my every part

166
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:23,847
And for this sin, there is no remedy

167
00:13:24,585 --> 00:13:27,349
It is so grounded inward in my heart.

168
00:13:27,522 --> 00:13:29,820
So for their last robbery at Blue Cut...

169
00:13:29,991 --> 00:13:33,586
...the brothers recruited a gang
of petty thieves and country rubes...

170
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:36,423
...culled from the local hillsides.

171
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,470
Right on schedule, Buck!

172
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:59,204
Snuff those lanterns!

173
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,180
Look at those fools. They're gonna trip
and shoot each other into females.

174
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:06,479
I bet you I could find them husbands
if they do.

175
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:53,083
Fan out!

176
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:58,531
Hold your fire!

177
00:17:01,502 --> 00:17:02,730
- Watch him!
- Going down.

178
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,475
Hold your fire, you idiots!

179
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:21,713
Hold your fire!

180
00:17:31,832 --> 00:17:33,561
Let me in.

181
00:17:34,268 --> 00:17:36,133
Buck! Boys!

182
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:38,363
Buck, this way!

183
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,674
Do you think that lock will hold?

184
00:17:43,244 --> 00:17:44,905
No, I don't.

185
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,338
Let's go, let's go.

186
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,961
Let's not get clever, nor courageous,
any of you.

187
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:18,540
Hey there, boys!
These are all for me?

188
00:18:21,382 --> 00:18:23,816
Looks like Christmas morning in here.

189
00:18:25,653 --> 00:18:27,245
Hey, friend.

190
00:18:28,756 --> 00:18:30,747
You mind if I have a peek around?

191
00:18:31,158 --> 00:18:33,388
This shit. Nope.

192
00:18:35,196 --> 00:18:36,493
Nope.

193
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:39,496
You got anything good here?

194
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:41,801
It could be.

195
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:58,518
Open that safe.

196
00:19:03,858 --> 00:19:05,416
Do it!

197
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:12,023
- You didn't have to bop him.
- Yeah, he did. They needed convincing.

198
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:14,633
They got their company rules,
I got my mean streak...

199
00:19:14,802 --> 00:19:17,293
...and that's how
we get things done around here.

200
00:19:18,406 --> 00:19:22,103
- Get on over here and attend to this thing.
- Come on, go.

201
00:19:26,247 --> 00:19:29,114
Hold your fire, you idiots!

202
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,381
Dig deeper.

203
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:36,283
- Come on!
- Give me your money.

204
00:19:36,457 --> 00:19:39,392
- And you, stand up.
- Let's see your hands.

205
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,289
What have you got?

206
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:44,794
Speak English.

207
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,501
Money. Money. You understand that?

208
00:19:51,072 --> 00:19:52,539
Give me your money!

209
00:20:01,982 --> 00:20:03,916
There's some receipts.

210
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:07,519
I got fives.

211
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:11,524
Jesse. Jesse.

212
00:20:14,995 --> 00:20:16,826
Don't look good.

213
00:20:22,136 --> 00:20:25,435
There ain't no 100,000 dollars
in here, Dick.

214
00:20:34,315 --> 00:20:35,873
Get down on your knees.

215
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:38,608
Why?

216
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:40,344
Well, you ought to pray.

217
00:20:41,689 --> 00:20:42,713
I'm gonna kill you.

218
00:20:49,396 --> 00:20:51,159
Get at!

219
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:55,799
You're gonna have to make me.

220
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,700
All right.

221
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:30,397
Don't shoot him! No, don't shoot him.

222
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:45,313
Don't tell me what I can
and cannot do, Ed.

223
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,124
Round them up!

224
00:22:14,215 --> 00:22:18,015
Chicago newspaper publishers made
a great deal of the Blue Cut train robbery...

225
00:22:18,185 --> 00:22:20,176
...alleging that in no state
but Missouri...

226
00:22:20,354 --> 00:22:23,846
...would the James brothers be tolerated
for 12 years.

227
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:25,857
Hey.

228
00:22:27,294 --> 00:22:29,626
Can you keep a secret?

229
00:22:30,764 --> 00:22:33,392
It depends on what you're concealing.

230
00:22:34,735 --> 00:22:36,896
You afraid of the dark?

231
00:22:37,771 --> 00:22:39,295
No.

232
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,867
You superstitious?

233
00:22:44,211 --> 00:22:49,274
I put... I put an acorn in the window
to keep the lightning out.

234
00:23:37,765 --> 00:23:42,429
Kid, you must've crept up on cat's paws.

235
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,806
I'll wager that's the first and last time
you'll ever be caught off-guard.

236
00:23:50,077 --> 00:23:51,101
How old are you?

237
00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:53,979
Twenty.

238
00:23:56,684 --> 00:24:00,347
Except, well, I guess I won't
really be 20 till...

239
00:24:00,854 --> 00:24:03,015
Till January, so...

240
00:24:03,857 --> 00:24:05,722
I'm 19.

241
00:24:08,128 --> 00:24:11,291
Yeah, you feel older than that, though,
don't you?

242
00:24:16,003 --> 00:24:17,868
Yeah, I do.

243
00:24:30,851 --> 00:24:35,151
Hey, Frank, you...
You think the sheriff's out already?

244
00:24:36,757 --> 00:24:39,920
- More than likely.
- Yeah.

245
00:24:42,863 --> 00:24:44,660
I had a real fine time tonight.

246
00:24:44,832 --> 00:24:48,063
- You think so?
- Yup. Yeah.

247
00:24:48,235 --> 00:24:51,398
Hey, I wasn't just flapping my lips
about my kid brother and me.

248
00:24:51,772 --> 00:24:56,334
What I figured was if you and Jesse could
gauge our courage and our daring...

249
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,774
...you might just make us
your regular sidekicks.

250
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:01,176
Your courage and your daring.

251
00:25:02,449 --> 00:25:07,512
I about heard all I want to about sidekicks.
You sound like your damn brother.

252
00:25:07,688 --> 00:25:12,182
Yeah. Well, I'll be square with you,
it's Bob who put me up to it. He's...

253
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,059
He's got plans for the James boys
I can't even get the hang of.

254
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,027
- They're that complicated.
- Yeah?

255
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:21,761
Well, you can just
get shed of that idea.

256
00:25:21,935 --> 00:25:24,460
Because after tonight,
there'll be no more shenanigans.

257
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:27,972
You can jot that down in your little diary.

258
00:25:28,142 --> 00:25:32,909
September 7th, 1881, the James Gang
robbed one last train at Blue Cut...

259
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,571
...and gave up their nightriding for good.

260
00:25:42,222 --> 00:25:43,712
Wait.

261
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:47,850
Well, how are you gonna
make your living?

262
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,200
Maybe I'll sell shoes.

263
00:26:05,012 --> 00:26:07,105
I can't believe I woke up this morning...

264
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:10,580
...wondering if my daddy
would loan me his overcoat...

265
00:26:10,751 --> 00:26:12,616
...and here it is just past midnight...

266
00:26:12,786 --> 00:26:16,347
...l've already robbed a railroad train
and I'm sitting in a rocking chair...

267
00:26:16,523 --> 00:26:18,753
...chatting with none other
than Jesse James.

268
00:26:19,493 --> 00:26:22,121
Yeah, it's a wonderful world.

269
00:26:30,537 --> 00:26:32,368
What's this?

270
00:26:32,573 --> 00:26:34,268
Oh, yeah.

271
00:26:35,442 --> 00:26:39,503
I was real agitated this morning, so I was
wondering if I would know you or Frank...

272
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,811
...tell you all apart, and so I had
this clipping that described you both.

273
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:47,048
Want me to read it?

274
00:26:47,654 --> 00:26:48,814
Go on.

275
00:26:48,989 --> 00:26:53,085
Well... I gotta find it. Hold on.

276
00:26:53,994 --> 00:26:56,224
Here. Here.

277
00:26:56,396 --> 00:27:00,526
"Jesse James, the youngest, has a face
as smooth and innocent as a schoolgirl.

278
00:27:00,701 --> 00:27:05,070
The blue eyes, very clear and penetrating,
are never at rest.

279
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:08,731
His form is tall and graceful
and capable of great endurance...

280
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:10,342
...and great effort.

281
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:14,504
Jesse is lighthearted, reckless,
and devil-may-care.

282
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:18,916
- There's always a smile on his lips..."
- All right, all right, all right.

283
00:27:19,086 --> 00:27:22,886
Well, yeah, then it just... Frank, Frank,
Frank. That's nothing. And then...

284
00:27:35,335 --> 00:27:37,200
You know what I got
right next to my bed?

285
00:27:37,838 --> 00:27:42,901
Is The Train Robbers, or, A Story
of the James Boys by R.W. Stevens.

286
00:27:43,076 --> 00:27:46,011
I mean, many's the night I stayed up...

287
00:27:46,446 --> 00:27:48,607
...with my eyes open
and my mouth open...

288
00:27:48,782 --> 00:27:51,945
...just reading about your escapades
in the Wide Awake Library.

289
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:55,782
They're all lies, you know.

290
00:27:59,192 --> 00:28:01,160
Yeah, of course they are.

291
00:28:04,431 --> 00:28:07,628
You don't have to keep smoking that
if it's making you bungey.

292
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:33,892
Alexander Franklin James
would be in Baltimore...

293
00:28:34,061 --> 00:28:37,724
...when he would read of
the assassination of Jesse James.

294
00:28:51,178 --> 00:28:55,774
He had spurned his younger brother
for being peculiar and temperamental.

295
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:00,415
But once he perceived
that he would never see Jesse again...

296
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:05,651
...Frank would be wrought-up,
perplexed, despondent.

297
00:29:44,364 --> 00:29:47,629
My brother and me are hardly
on speaking terms these days.

298
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:51,300
Well, I wasn't gonna mention it.

299
00:30:01,848 --> 00:30:03,281
Are you scared?

300
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:06,211
No, I'm just surprised a little.

301
00:30:06,386 --> 00:30:08,946
They ain't as succulent as I like,
the devil to clean...

302
00:30:09,122 --> 00:30:12,182
...but if a man skins them
and fries them in garlic and oil...

303
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:15,226
...mercy, them's good eating.

304
00:30:15,395 --> 00:30:18,728
Well, I never been that hungry.

305
00:30:21,468 --> 00:30:23,561
I give them names.

306
00:30:25,005 --> 00:30:26,404
Such as?

307
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:31,600
Such as enemies.

308
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:35,343
I give them names of enemies.

309
00:30:48,095 --> 00:30:51,155
Go tell Wood and Charley
to get their gatherings together.

310
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:54,157
All right.

311
00:30:55,569 --> 00:30:57,127
Me too?

312
00:30:59,272 --> 00:31:01,240
You can stay.

313
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:05,235
All right.

314
00:31:11,852 --> 00:31:13,149
Hey.

315
00:31:15,388 --> 00:31:18,084
- What do you want, peckerwood?
- Nothing.

316
00:31:18,258 --> 00:31:20,886
Except to say Jesse wants
you two to gather your parts...

317
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:23,586
...get on your horses
and get out of town.

318
00:31:23,897 --> 00:31:25,888
And me to stick around.

319
00:31:28,235 --> 00:31:31,329
Well, whoa, I'm his cousin...

320
00:31:31,505 --> 00:31:33,234
...l'll have you know.

321
00:31:33,406 --> 00:31:35,567
My mama's his daddy's sister.

322
00:31:35,942 --> 00:31:38,172
Is that how they described it to you,
Wood?

323
00:31:39,846 --> 00:31:41,973
You better watch your tongue,
young sapling.

324
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:45,516
Why is it me who's gotta rattle his hocks
out of town and not you, Bunny?

325
00:31:45,685 --> 00:31:47,414
Put your horns away.
If I know Jess...

326
00:31:47,587 --> 00:31:50,818
...there's some real nasty
sad-suzie work's gotta be done...

327
00:31:51,224 --> 00:31:54,091
...and Bob's the ninny that has to do it.

328
00:31:54,261 --> 00:31:56,525
Oh, yeah, I'm sure that's it, Charley.

329
00:31:58,265 --> 00:32:02,964
You only met him 12 hours ago.
He doesn't even know your name.

330
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:07,462
Wood! You tell your daddy
I'll be in Kentucky in October.

331
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:11,241
We can hunt some birds together.

332
00:32:11,778 --> 00:32:13,211
All right.

333
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,472
So how come it's Bob who gets to stay?

334
00:32:20,053 --> 00:32:23,045
Bob's gonna move my gear to a house
down the street.

335
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,114
See?

336
00:32:25,892 --> 00:32:28,417
- I don't mind.
- Yeah, well.

337
00:32:28,595 --> 00:32:30,688
Sounds like an adventure.

338
00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:38,399
They moved to 1017 Troost Avenue
at night...

339
00:32:38,572 --> 00:32:43,009
...so that the neighborhood couldn't get
a good look at them or their belongings.

340
00:32:44,711 --> 00:32:47,407
Then Bob thought Jesse
would give him eight hours' sleep...

341
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:49,947
...and a daydreaming goodbye.

342
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,979
But with a second day
in the Thomas Howard house...

343
00:32:56,156 --> 00:32:58,147
...Bob thought he might never go...

344
00:32:59,025 --> 00:33:02,825
...but might be brought in
as a good-natured cousin to the boy...

345
00:33:04,264 --> 00:33:07,028
...and a gentleman helper to Zee.

346
00:33:10,036 --> 00:33:11,799
He went everywhere with Jesse.

347
00:33:11,972 --> 00:33:14,236
They made trips
to the Topeka Exchange Saloon...

348
00:33:14,407 --> 00:33:18,207
...where Jesse could spend nearly
60 minutes sipping one glass of beer...

349
00:33:18,378 --> 00:33:21,609
...and still complain about feeling tipsy.

350
00:33:22,282 --> 00:33:25,274
Bob would rarely vouchsafe his opinions
as they talked.

351
00:33:25,452 --> 00:33:28,979
If spoken to, he would fidget and grin.

352
00:33:29,723 --> 00:33:33,784
If Jesse palavered with another person,
Bob secretaried their dialogue...

353
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,726
...getting each inflection,
reading every gesture and tic...

354
00:33:37,898 --> 00:33:41,095
...as if he wanted to compose
a biography of the outlaw...

355
00:33:41,268 --> 00:33:44,203
...or as if he were preparing
an impersonation.

356
00:34:00,053 --> 00:34:01,987
Go away.

357
00:34:04,824 --> 00:34:08,555
Used to be couldn't no one sneak up
on Jesse James.

358
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:12,262
Now you think otherwise?

359
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:16,530
I ain't never seen you without your guns,
neither.

360
00:34:29,783 --> 00:34:32,115
I can't figure it out.

361
00:34:33,019 --> 00:34:35,180
Do you wanna be like me...

362
00:34:35,622 --> 00:34:37,112
...or do you wanna be me?

363
00:34:43,029 --> 00:34:45,293
I'm just making fun, is all.

364
00:34:47,934 --> 00:34:51,199
Bob was sent away cordially
the next day...

365
00:34:51,371 --> 00:34:52,861
...with a goodbye from Jesse...

366
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,975
...but nothing from Zee
beyond what good manners demanded.

367
00:35:00,547 --> 00:35:03,380
It was 40 miles to his sister's farm
from Kansas City.

368
00:35:04,684 --> 00:35:08,984
And it was well into the afternoon
by the time he arrived there.

369
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:14,017
Mrs. Martha Bolton rented
the Harbison farm in 1879...

370
00:35:14,194 --> 00:35:16,754
...just after becoming a widow.

371
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,960
And she made a good income
by giving rooms and meals...

372
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:25,298
...to her brothers Charley, Wilbur and Bob,
and to members of the James Gang...

373
00:35:25,472 --> 00:35:27,963
...who would appear
whenever they needed seclusion.

374
00:35:28,141 --> 00:35:29,836
Dick! You're gonna make her sick!

375
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,979
She's gonna upchuck
if you don't watch out!

376
00:35:33,546 --> 00:35:36,743
Wood Hite had been spurned by Martha
in his affections...

377
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:39,612
...and his attempt to switch his pursuit
to her daughter...

378
00:35:39,786 --> 00:35:41,686
...was being thwarted by Dick Liddil.

379
00:35:41,855 --> 00:35:45,154
Wait a second, you assured me
that you were not ticklish.

380
00:35:45,325 --> 00:35:46,349
Howdy!

381
00:35:46,526 --> 00:35:48,357
What's going on, now?
What's going on...?

382
00:35:48,528 --> 00:35:51,361
- Howdy!
- Were you fibbing about that?

383
00:35:51,531 --> 00:35:53,328
- No.
- Not at all.

384
00:35:54,868 --> 00:35:56,563
You're not supposed to peek, Dick.

385
00:35:56,736 --> 00:35:59,170
Well, you're just so pretty
I can't help myself.

386
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:01,830
- You need to be warning him about that.
- Howdy.

387
00:36:02,008 --> 00:36:05,944
Worry about the field instead,
might be able to worry about the work...

388
00:36:06,112 --> 00:36:07,977
Howdy!

389
00:36:08,748 --> 00:36:11,717
- Finally home.
- I'm so glad, Bob.

390
00:36:11,885 --> 00:36:14,547
I'm in that room too, Bob.
Don't mess with my things.

391
00:36:14,721 --> 00:36:16,746
All right, Grandpa.

392
00:36:22,562 --> 00:36:28,159
"July 9th. Diligence, tact,
and a keen sense of responsibility...

393
00:36:28,334 --> 00:36:32,737
...capacity for detail are your dominant
traits. Your sense of duty's strong."

394
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,677
How long you been there?

395
00:37:18,852 --> 00:37:21,753
Just now arrived. Did I miss much?

396
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:26,926
Not unless you never seen a man
wash his dirty carcass before.

397
00:37:27,193 --> 00:37:30,594
Boy, you got a big old pecker
for being such a little squirrel.

398
00:37:30,763 --> 00:37:32,754
That what you come here to see, Dick?

399
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:36,134
No.

400
00:37:37,103 --> 00:37:40,504
Your brother said that Jesse
kept you in Kansas City some extra days.

401
00:37:40,673 --> 00:37:41,731
What was the reason?

402
00:37:43,943 --> 00:37:47,845
Well, I'm not at liberty to say exactly.

403
00:37:48,248 --> 00:37:53,777
Let me ask you this. Did Jesse mention
that me and Cummins were in cahoots?

404
00:37:54,954 --> 00:37:56,114
Is that so?

405
00:37:56,289 --> 00:38:00,225
Oh, dear. I went on and said too much,
have I?

406
00:38:00,593 --> 00:38:02,652
Well, who else is partners with you two?

407
00:38:05,031 --> 00:38:09,525
See, he'll cut our throats if he finds out.
You don't know him like I do.

408
00:38:09,702 --> 00:38:13,695
You do Jesse dirt,
you connive behind his back...

409
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:16,671
...boy, he'll come after you
with a cleaver.

410
00:38:19,379 --> 00:38:21,870
So, what are you two cahoots
cooking up?

411
00:38:24,884 --> 00:38:26,511
Don't know that I should say.

412
00:38:27,687 --> 00:38:29,780
I'm not gonna wheedle
the dang news from you.

413
00:38:29,956 --> 00:38:31,719
How about we'll leave it a mystery...

414
00:38:31,991 --> 00:38:36,189
...and then we won't neither one of us
regret our little chat?

415
00:38:41,901 --> 00:38:44,665
Can you hand me that six-gun there, Bob?

416
00:38:53,746 --> 00:38:57,876
If you so much as mention my name
to Jesse...

417
00:38:58,051 --> 00:39:00,383
...boy, I'll find out about it.

418
00:39:00,553 --> 00:39:03,545
You had better believe that.

419
00:39:03,723 --> 00:39:05,748
And I'll look you up.

420
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:10,828
I'll knock on your door,
and I will be as mad as a hornet.

421
00:39:11,564 --> 00:39:13,725
I will be hot.

422
00:39:15,635 --> 00:39:18,399
You be careful with that iron, Dick.

423
00:39:26,713 --> 00:39:30,308
You know where I stand on these matters
and that's all there is to it.

424
00:39:30,483 --> 00:39:34,078
Me and you can be as friendly as pigs
from now on.

425
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:03,037
I'm Bunny Ford, stick your hands
up in the air!

426
00:40:03,216 --> 00:40:04,911
Mister.

427
00:40:10,189 --> 00:40:12,419
Oh, you have some nerve.

428
00:40:13,726 --> 00:40:19,130
We were just reading about the James boys
among the Mexicans.

429
00:40:20,867 --> 00:40:23,529
What's this? This ain't Jesse.

430
00:40:23,703 --> 00:40:26,831
- You don't know that.
- He would've never wore no mustache.

431
00:40:27,006 --> 00:40:29,372
Never was anywheres near a cannon.

432
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:31,976
Let me see that picture.

433
00:40:32,145 --> 00:40:34,875
Boy, I can't even calculate
what I'm looking at.

434
00:40:35,114 --> 00:40:37,241
- Give me that.
- Ever since he was a child...

435
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:40,614
...Bob's collected whatsoever he could find
about the James brothers.

436
00:40:40,787 --> 00:40:42,982
Yeah, got himself a little museum
in his room.

437
00:40:43,156 --> 00:40:46,751
Next time you come snooping around,
you better strap on a shooting iron!

438
00:40:47,293 --> 00:40:49,784
Well, you can see how scared I am.

439
00:40:49,962 --> 00:40:53,830
You too, Wood Hite. Cross me again,
I'll put a bullet through your head!

440
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:56,028
Boy, you...

441
00:40:56,703 --> 00:40:59,365
Son, you better recollect
who my cousin is...

442
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:03,600
...because you've seemed to misremembered
that Jesse loves me like the Good Book.

443
00:41:03,776 --> 00:41:07,405
Now, you may play it like you're
a dangerous person in the grocery store...

444
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,980
...but don't misremember
who you be accounting to...

445
00:41:10,149 --> 00:41:12,583
...if I so much get my feelings hurt.
- I don't care!

446
00:41:12,752 --> 00:41:14,310
Do I have to yell "suwee"?

447
00:41:14,487 --> 00:41:16,455
Why don't we make up,
be pleasant for once?

448
00:41:16,622 --> 00:41:19,455
Why don't we pass the evening
like pleasant human beings?

449
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:21,889
I like your nickel suit, cowboy.

450
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,483
You see something?

451
00:41:50,723 --> 00:41:52,520
Just a bird.

452
00:41:56,295 --> 00:41:58,195
The month of October came...

453
00:41:58,364 --> 00:42:01,800
...and Jesse began seeing
Pinkerton operatives in every floor walker...

454
00:42:01,968 --> 00:42:06,371
...street sweeper, and common man
poking about in a store.

455
00:42:08,641 --> 00:42:11,166
On the morning of the 11 th,
he would wake his wife...

456
00:42:11,344 --> 00:42:15,542
...with the Scripture pertaining to
the Holy Family's flight into Egypt.

457
00:42:19,285 --> 00:42:24,188
Overnight, the Thomas Howard clan
vanished from Kansas City.

458
00:42:34,667 --> 00:42:37,329
Shortly thereafter,
four of the Blue Cut train robbers...

459
00:42:37,503 --> 00:42:40,336
...were arrested in shacks near Glendale.

460
00:42:45,378 --> 00:42:49,075
How Jesse could have known
remains a mystery.

461
00:43:01,127 --> 00:43:04,119
Theirs was a wandering existence.

462
00:43:04,297 --> 00:43:05,992
Men who choose to be outlaws...

463
00:43:06,165 --> 00:43:10,101
...cannot afford to remain in one place
for very long.

464
00:43:19,145 --> 00:43:23,411
- Well, goodness. Maybe I'll change my mind.
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

465
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:25,813
- Martha.
- Buck up, man.

466
00:43:25,985 --> 00:43:29,546
Wood and Dick would bicker
across the entire state of Kentucky...

467
00:43:29,722 --> 00:43:34,682
...until they made Russellville, home
of Major George Hite, Wood's father...

468
00:43:34,861 --> 00:43:37,989
...and uncle to Frank and Jesse James.

469
00:43:46,072 --> 00:43:48,233
You stay away from this one.

470
00:43:49,008 --> 00:43:51,033
She's my daddy's wife.

471
00:43:51,978 --> 00:43:53,309
You got it?

472
00:44:17,236 --> 00:44:18,863
Did you cook this, ma'am?

473
00:44:22,174 --> 00:44:24,438
I've got a nigger woman.

474
00:44:26,546 --> 00:44:27,570
How's that?

475
00:44:32,018 --> 00:44:35,385
Dick asked if I cooked this.

476
00:44:35,621 --> 00:44:37,111
Did you?

477
00:44:39,692 --> 00:44:40,716
No.

478
00:44:49,936 --> 00:44:52,370
She knew what he was like
when she married him.

479
00:45:18,898 --> 00:45:23,130
I guess we're the night owls, you and I.

480
00:45:24,537 --> 00:45:26,368
I'm glad.

481
00:45:28,674 --> 00:45:30,107
How come?

482
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:33,704
You're interesting to look at.

483
00:45:34,614 --> 00:45:38,106
You have a real pleasant disposition.

484
00:45:39,752 --> 00:45:43,688
And I don't know, you sort of
make me feel warm all over.

485
00:45:45,691 --> 00:45:50,355
You know, I'm what they call a...
An inamorato.

486
00:45:54,233 --> 00:45:58,932
Well, I knew
there had to be a name for it.

487
00:46:02,775 --> 00:46:04,936
You and the Hites
don't get along too well...

488
00:46:05,111 --> 00:46:08,376
...if I'm to trust Wood and his version
of the situation.

489
00:46:09,548 --> 00:46:13,075
We hate each other like poison,
if you wanna know the truth.

490
00:46:13,753 --> 00:46:17,450
Most of the Hites wouldn't spit on me
if I was on fire.

491
00:46:19,692 --> 00:46:22,490
They say that when a woman's on fire...

492
00:46:22,662 --> 00:46:27,099
...you're supposed to roll her around on
the ground and cover her with your body.

493
00:46:28,434 --> 00:46:31,164
Well, you are a naughty tease.

494
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:40,042
Isn't it about bedtime?

495
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,247
Well, I'll just kiss those dainty nubbins.

496
00:46:58,197 --> 00:46:59,596
Good night.

497
00:47:14,046 --> 00:47:15,138
Would you stop?

498
00:47:20,419 --> 00:47:24,446
Boy, I believe I drank too much coffee.

499
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,493
I gotta go visit the privy
something terrible.

500
00:48:00,793 --> 00:48:03,091
This is embarrassing.

501
00:48:03,763 --> 00:48:07,824
Now, you go ahead and do your duty.
I don't mind.

502
00:48:09,001 --> 00:48:13,062
I've sort of got stage fright with
a strange man in the commode with me.

503
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:14,763
I ain't strange.

504
00:48:15,074 --> 00:48:17,975
I'm built just like the rest of them.

505
00:48:20,713 --> 00:48:23,807
You look awful pretty.

506
00:48:25,217 --> 00:48:26,980
Do I?

507
00:48:27,353 --> 00:48:32,017
I haven't never in my life seen
such well-shaped limbs.

508
00:48:39,598 --> 00:48:41,725
Is Wood awake?

509
00:48:43,969 --> 00:48:45,231
It's just me.

510
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,014
And I bet you thought I was a lady.

511
00:49:43,829 --> 00:49:46,161
Well, you ain't much of a housekeeper,
are you?

512
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:51,196
You didn't just happen by.

513
00:49:53,606 --> 00:49:55,301
Why not?

514
00:50:22,568 --> 00:50:25,469
Go on and take a load off your feet.

515
00:50:50,496 --> 00:50:52,555
You ought to get yourself a wife.

516
00:50:52,932 --> 00:50:54,297
Yeah.

517
00:50:54,533 --> 00:50:56,364
I suppose.

518
00:50:59,738 --> 00:51:02,969
I was gonna ask Martha. Charley's sister.

519
00:51:03,142 --> 00:51:06,509
I was gonna ask her
if she could imagine it.

520
00:51:07,746 --> 00:51:10,613
But I guess Wood has plans of his own.

521
00:51:11,216 --> 00:51:13,844
And there's always Dick Liddil
getting in the way.

522
00:51:14,954 --> 00:51:16,922
I'll give it some thought, though.

523
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:19,658
Your crops come in?

524
00:51:20,859 --> 00:51:25,956
No, I don't got much.
Just a garden patch and a pasture.

525
00:51:28,233 --> 00:51:30,599
I was sick at planting time.

526
00:51:31,603 --> 00:51:33,002
So...

527
00:51:35,207 --> 00:51:37,539
Ed, how you feeling now?

528
00:51:40,379 --> 00:51:41,437
Why?

529
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:45,544
You're acting queer.

530
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:57,722
Well, you and me ain't been
just real good friends lately.

531
00:51:58,697 --> 00:52:01,791
That's not your fault,
you understand that.

532
00:52:04,136 --> 00:52:05,763
You hear talk, though.

533
00:52:07,806 --> 00:52:09,296
Talk?

534
00:52:13,112 --> 00:52:15,342
People tell you things.

535
00:52:22,888 --> 00:52:24,981
Why don't you give me an example?

536
00:52:29,294 --> 00:52:31,421
Jim Cummins come by here.

537
00:52:33,065 --> 00:52:34,396
Jim Cummins.

538
00:52:35,601 --> 00:52:37,899
Oh, and Jim says:

539
00:52:40,439 --> 00:52:44,136
"You know them boys
that got caught in the Blue Cut deal?"

540
00:52:47,212 --> 00:52:50,841
Well, Jim says he got word...

541
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:57,580
...that you're planning to kill them.

542
00:52:59,425 --> 00:53:01,689
Why would I do that?

543
00:53:03,629 --> 00:53:05,756
That's just talk probably.

544
00:53:09,768 --> 00:53:13,602
Jim Cummins. He say anything else?

545
00:53:13,972 --> 00:53:17,840
Nope. No, that was it, basically.

546
00:53:28,253 --> 00:53:30,653
That still don't explain why you're scared.

547
00:53:34,293 --> 00:53:37,160
Well, I'm in the same situation, you see.

548
00:53:37,896 --> 00:53:39,921
I was terrified I saw you ride up.

549
00:53:40,566 --> 00:53:43,558
- I just happened by, Ed.
- Suppose you heard gossip, though.

550
00:53:43,735 --> 00:53:46,670
Suppose you heard Jim Cummins
come by, you might have thought...

551
00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:51,799
...that we were planning to capture you
or get that reward, and that ain't true.

552
00:53:51,977 --> 00:53:54,275
But you might have suspected it.

553
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:15,225
Haven't heard a lick of gossip lately.

554
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,837
I got 600 dollars stashed away.
I don't need no governor's reward.

555
00:54:22,741 --> 00:54:24,675
Well, it's the principle too.

556
00:54:29,681 --> 00:54:31,171
Well...

557
00:54:31,483 --> 00:54:34,975
- I'm glad I stopped by.
- Oh, me too.

558
00:54:59,778 --> 00:55:02,838
What do you say
if we were to go for a ride?

559
00:55:07,786 --> 00:55:10,653
We can go into town. I'll buy you dinner.

560
00:55:12,257 --> 00:55:14,555
Then I'll be on my way.

561
00:55:23,535 --> 00:55:25,264
Okay.

562
00:56:25,697 --> 00:56:27,426
You ready to go for a ride?

563
00:56:43,215 --> 00:56:45,581
We going to your place?

564
00:56:50,422 --> 00:56:52,549
You seen Ed Miller lately?

565
00:56:53,925 --> 00:56:56,052
Nobody has.

566
00:56:59,865 --> 00:57:02,459
Must have gone off to California.

567
00:57:06,505 --> 00:57:08,837
I'd still like to know where we're going.

568
00:57:14,012 --> 00:57:17,914
If you were going to see Jim Cummins,
wouldn't you follow this road?

569
00:57:23,355 --> 00:57:25,186
I guess so.

570
00:58:08,133 --> 00:58:09,600
Howdy.

571
00:58:20,479 --> 00:58:22,606
Oh, are you friends of my pa's?

572
00:58:27,686 --> 00:58:29,517
We're friends of Jim Cummins.

573
00:58:33,658 --> 00:58:36,559
Well, it so happens
he's been gone since August.

574
00:58:36,728 --> 00:58:38,787
And never said where he gone to.

575
00:58:43,702 --> 00:58:46,933
- I'm Matt Collins.
- Albert Ford.

576
00:58:47,105 --> 00:58:49,073
Very happy to meet you.

577
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:58,272
- Dick Turpin.
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.

578
00:59:10,996 --> 00:59:12,987
I don't know where he is!
Leave me alone!

579
00:59:13,165 --> 00:59:14,928
Shut your mouth!
You shut your mouth!

580
00:59:16,902 --> 00:59:19,769
- You shut your mouth.
- I don't know where he is!

581
00:59:20,472 --> 00:59:22,497
- I don't know!
- Get in there.

582
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:24,399
Shut up.

583
00:59:24,576 --> 00:59:27,067
- I don't know where he is!
- Shut up.

584
00:59:28,146 --> 00:59:29,613
- I don't know!
- Shut up.

585
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:30,839
- Jesus.
- Shut up.

586
00:59:31,016 --> 00:59:33,109
Jesse, he's just a kid.

587
00:59:33,518 --> 00:59:37,181
He knows where his uncle Jim is and
that's gonna make him old soon enough.

588
00:59:37,355 --> 00:59:39,653
- Maybe he doesn't know.
- He knows!

589
00:59:39,825 --> 00:59:41,486
You need to ask and ask sometimes.

590
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:45,289
Sometimes a child don't remember so much
at first. But it'll come back to him.

591
00:59:47,332 --> 00:59:49,857
My goodness, she's about to rip off,
sweetie.

592
00:59:50,035 --> 00:59:52,026
Just a little more here to get her started.

593
00:59:52,204 --> 00:59:54,968
Then I think I can rip her off
like a page from a book.

594
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,233
Jesus, he can't even talk.

595
01:00:00,078 --> 01:00:01,636
Where's Jim?

596
01:00:01,813 --> 01:00:03,280
Where's Jim?

597
01:00:03,448 --> 01:00:05,416
Where's Jim? Where's Jim?

598
01:00:05,584 --> 01:00:08,951
Where's Jim? Where's Jim? Where's Jim?

599
01:00:09,287 --> 01:00:11,551
- Where's Jim?
- Quit it!

600
01:00:12,057 --> 01:00:14,457
You bastard! I don't know where he is!

601
01:00:14,626 --> 01:00:17,493
You won't believe me!
You never even gave me a chance!

602
01:00:17,662 --> 01:00:19,653
You kept my... You kept my mouth shut!

603
01:00:21,032 --> 01:00:24,433
I never know where Jim is or
when he comes! So leave me alone.

604
01:00:24,603 --> 01:00:27,037
Get off me, you son of a bitch!

605
01:01:20,091 --> 01:01:22,025
I'm worn out.

606
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,127
I can't. No, see...

607
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:30,726
My mind's all tangled anyway.

608
01:01:31,269 --> 01:01:34,727
Little deals like this
just make me feel dirty.

609
01:01:55,794 --> 01:01:57,819
Are you all right, Jesse?

610
01:02:26,391 --> 01:02:28,222
Jesse was sick...

611
01:02:28,393 --> 01:02:32,853
...with rheums, and aches
and lung congestions.

612
01:02:33,732 --> 01:02:37,031
Insomnia stained
his eye sockets like soot.

613
01:02:37,869 --> 01:02:40,861
He read auguries in
the snarled intestines of chickens...

614
01:02:42,073 --> 01:02:45,634
...or the blow of cat hair
released to the wind.

615
01:02:46,444 --> 01:02:51,404
And the omens promised bad luck,
which moated and dungeoned him.

616
01:03:33,124 --> 01:03:35,684
How come it's you
that's gotta do all the chores?

617
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:40,092
Charley and Bob pay extry to Martha
so that they don't have to.

618
01:03:41,399 --> 01:03:43,458
It still don't seem fair.

619
01:03:50,241 --> 01:03:51,765
Martha.

620
01:03:53,511 --> 01:03:56,105
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

621
01:04:00,919 --> 01:04:02,181
You come from Kentucky?

622
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:09,424
Why do you have your head in a hole,
Martha?

623
01:04:12,464 --> 01:04:16,195
Wood and Dick had a shooting scrape
a few months ago.

624
01:04:17,769 --> 01:04:19,031
Cover the kettle, Ida.

625
01:04:24,309 --> 01:04:26,607
And what did you and Dick
get in a scrape about?

626
01:04:30,482 --> 01:04:34,475
Well, he tampered
with my daddy's wife...

627
01:04:34,652 --> 01:04:38,019
...while a pork chop
burned on the skillet...

628
01:04:38,189 --> 01:04:39,713
...so I shot at him.

629
01:04:44,796 --> 01:04:49,199
Ida! Do not stick your thumb
in the cream when you skim it.

630
01:04:50,368 --> 01:04:55,567
His chicanery and his philandering ways...

631
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:57,708
...has instigated such malice.

632
01:04:57,876 --> 01:05:01,812
He's a yellow snake in the grass
and he can't be trusted, Martha.

633
01:05:04,716 --> 01:05:08,083
Dick told me a complete other version
of that affray.

634
01:05:09,554 --> 01:05:12,216
Wood Hite's downstairs.

635
01:05:12,924 --> 01:05:14,619
You mean he's here?

636
01:05:17,395 --> 01:05:20,091
Yeah, he come in late last night.

637
01:05:23,802 --> 01:05:24,826
Hey, simmer down!

638
01:05:25,003 --> 01:05:29,565
Don't get into a fracas up there, you boys!
I've got breakfast almost ready.

639
01:07:40,471 --> 01:07:42,666
He's still sucking air.

640
01:07:43,841 --> 01:07:46,036
But I think he's a goner.

641
01:07:56,187 --> 01:07:59,486
Maybe y'all better come wish him well
on his journey.

642
01:08:26,284 --> 01:08:27,751
Wood?

643
01:08:30,188 --> 01:08:32,452
You were a good fellow, Wood.

644
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:36,182
Oh, I sure hope you're not
in frightful pain, Wood.

645
01:08:36,761 --> 01:08:40,492
I'd get you something to drink,
but I'm afraid you'd just choke on it.

646
01:08:41,866 --> 01:08:44,027
Little Ida's gonna miss you.

647
01:08:44,202 --> 01:08:46,329
So is the rest of the family.

648
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:53,169
Well, one thing's settled.
Can't take him into Richmond.

649
01:08:54,245 --> 01:08:55,303
Why not?

650
01:08:56,781 --> 01:08:59,341
Well, one, sheriff'll put Bob in jail.

651
01:08:59,517 --> 01:09:03,385
And two, Jesse'll find out his cousin
Wood's been shot in our house...

652
01:09:03,554 --> 01:09:06,955
...and then that'll be the end
of each and every one of us.

653
01:09:16,868 --> 01:09:20,531
"And in one merciless, violent thrust
broke in...

654
01:09:20,972 --> 01:09:23,805
...and carried all before him,
and scented and brewed...

655
01:09:23,975 --> 01:09:26,500
...reeking with blood of my virginity...

656
01:09:26,677 --> 01:09:31,205
...up to its utmost length in my body."

657
01:09:32,817 --> 01:09:35,684
He ain't disappeared,
if that's what you were hoping.

658
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:42,126
What chapter you on?

659
01:09:42,627 --> 01:09:47,655
She's met some Algerian corsair
down at Gibraltar.

660
01:09:47,832 --> 01:09:50,130
Got herself all agitated.

661
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:53,903
How's that leg?

662
01:09:54,705 --> 01:09:58,869
Full of torment, Bob. Thanks for asking.

663
01:10:44,755 --> 01:10:47,417
Blessed are the poor in spirit...

664
01:10:47,592 --> 01:10:49,856
...for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

665
01:10:51,295 --> 01:10:56,858
Blessed are them that mourn,
for they shall be comforted.

666
01:10:59,003 --> 01:11:00,937
Blessed are the...

667
01:11:04,475 --> 01:11:05,999
Meek.

668
01:11:08,279 --> 01:11:10,110
Blessed are the meek.

669
01:11:46,083 --> 01:11:48,142
- Is it him?
- Yeah.

670
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:51,345
Why is he here? Does he know
about Wood, do you think?

671
01:11:51,522 --> 01:11:53,922
I don't know. All I know is
he don't miss very much.

672
01:11:54,091 --> 01:11:58,050
- What should I say about you if he asks?
- Tell him I'm in K.C. With Mattie.

673
01:12:00,765 --> 01:12:04,565
He was buffalo hunting.
He was thrilled to meet yours truly.

674
01:12:04,735 --> 01:12:08,671
Yeah, over there in Europe there's only
two Americans they know for certain...

675
01:12:08,839 --> 01:12:11,774
...Mark Twain and Jesse James.

676
01:12:13,144 --> 01:12:16,375
- Why, it's the kid.
- How's everything?

677
01:12:18,816 --> 01:12:21,410
- I never take off my gun belts.
- Yeah?

678
01:12:21,586 --> 01:12:23,144
Good thinking.

679
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:31,524
Well, Charley, did you hurt your leg?

680
01:12:34,065 --> 01:12:36,090
Yeah, I slipped...
I slipped off the roof...

681
01:12:36,267 --> 01:12:39,862
...and I smacked down into a snow bank
like a ton of stupidness.

682
01:12:40,037 --> 01:12:42,699
One second I'm screaming,
"Whoa, Nelly!"

683
01:12:42,873 --> 01:12:45,535
Next second, poof,
I'm neck-deep in snow.

684
01:12:48,446 --> 01:12:52,280
Well, whatever possessed you
to climb a roof in December?

685
01:12:58,289 --> 01:13:01,747
There was a k... A kite. What am I saying?
There was a cat.

686
01:13:01,926 --> 01:13:04,326
A cat. It was on the roof
and I went after him.

687
01:13:04,527 --> 01:13:09,055
It was a tomcat yowling
and what all, and I slipped.

688
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:24,104
I thought maybe your club foot
was gaining on you.

689
01:13:33,156 --> 01:13:34,783
Oh, yeah.

690
01:13:35,558 --> 01:13:39,790
Dick went to Kansas City to be
with his wife. He was here for a bit.

691
01:13:59,415 --> 01:14:02,316
Hey, here's a cute story, Jess.

692
01:14:02,485 --> 01:14:05,852
Bobby was what, 11 or 12...

693
01:14:06,022 --> 01:14:09,185
...and you were by far
his most admired personage.

694
01:14:09,692 --> 01:14:10,852
He couldn't get enough.

695
01:14:11,027 --> 01:14:15,225
It was "Jesse this" and "Jesse that"
and "Jesse this" from sunrise to sunset.

696
01:14:15,398 --> 01:14:16,524
Fascinating.

697
01:14:16,699 --> 01:14:18,428
No, there's more. This is cute.

698
01:14:18,601 --> 01:14:23,368
We're at supper and Bob asks,
"You know what size boot Jesse wears?"

699
01:14:23,539 --> 01:14:27,270
- Charley, Jesse doesn't wanna hear this.
- Shush, now, Bob, let me tell it.

700
01:14:27,443 --> 01:14:30,469
Bob says... He says, "You know
what size boot Jesse wears?"

701
01:14:30,646 --> 01:14:33,809
He says, "Six and a half." He says,
"Ain't that a big enough boot...

702
01:14:33,983 --> 01:14:35,780
...for a man 5'8"tall?"

703
01:14:35,952 --> 01:14:39,786
I decided to josh him a little, you know,
he being my kid brother and everything.

704
01:14:39,956 --> 01:14:43,050
So I said, "He doesn't have toes is why."

705
01:14:43,226 --> 01:14:44,750
That's a really stupid story.

706
01:14:44,927 --> 01:14:49,523
"He was dangling his feet off a culvert
and a catfish nibbled his toes off."

707
01:14:49,699 --> 01:14:52,429
Bob taxed himself trying to picture it.

708
01:14:59,308 --> 01:15:01,970
That'd be a good joke if it was funny.

709
01:15:02,812 --> 01:15:05,337
Isn't that a cute story, Jess?

710
01:15:15,224 --> 01:15:18,091
Give me some more conversations, Bob.

711
01:15:23,166 --> 01:15:28,331
I got one. This one's about as crackerjack...
It's the one about your...

712
01:15:28,504 --> 01:15:30,404
Let Bob tell it.

713
01:15:31,774 --> 01:15:33,571
All right.

714
01:15:40,116 --> 01:15:42,107
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

715
01:15:42,285 --> 01:15:46,278
About how you and Jesse
have so much in common.

716
01:15:49,325 --> 01:15:50,986
Go on, Bob.

717
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:53,128
Yeah, come on, Bob.

718
01:15:53,863 --> 01:15:56,127
Tell us a story.

719
01:15:58,067 --> 01:16:02,663
- Nope. No.
- Come on, entertain Jesse. He's here.

720
01:16:09,612 --> 01:16:11,136
Come on.

721
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:21,922
Well, if you'll pardon my saying so,
I guess...

722
01:16:22,091 --> 01:16:26,152
...it is interesting the many ways
you and I overlap and whatnot.

723
01:16:27,463 --> 01:16:30,227
I mean, you begin with our daddies.

724
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:33,368
Your daddy was a pastor
at the New Hope Baptist Church...

725
01:16:33,536 --> 01:16:38,269
...and my daddy was a pastor
at the church in Excelsior Springs.

726
01:16:39,709 --> 01:16:44,043
You're the youngest of three James boys,
and I'm the youngest of five Ford boys.

727
01:16:45,848 --> 01:16:48,510
Between Charley and me,
there's another brother, Wilbur...

728
01:16:48,684 --> 01:16:50,709
...with six letters in his name.

729
01:16:51,053 --> 01:16:56,650
And between Frank and you, is another
brother Robert, also with six letters.

730
01:16:56,859 --> 01:17:00,590
And my Christian name
is Robert, of course.

731
01:17:01,931 --> 01:17:04,092
You have blue eyes, I have blue eyes.

732
01:17:04,267 --> 01:17:08,260
You're 5'8"tall, I'm 5'8" tall.

733
01:17:13,009 --> 01:17:18,379
Me, I must have had a list as long as
your nightshirt when I was 12, but...

734
01:17:18,548 --> 01:17:21,984
...I seem to have lost some curiosities
over the years.

735
01:17:40,271 --> 01:17:42,466
Ain't he something?

736
01:17:55,052 --> 01:17:59,250
Did I ever tell you the story about
that scalawag, George Shepherd?

737
01:17:59,557 --> 01:18:01,457
Shepherd's one of
Quantrill's lieutenants.

738
01:18:01,625 --> 01:18:04,321
He give me a story much like Bob's
what bring him to mind.

739
01:18:04,795 --> 01:18:07,320
Going on about how much
we had in common, and so on...

740
01:18:07,498 --> 01:18:10,023
...so he could get in the gang.

741
01:18:10,201 --> 01:18:13,329
How could I have known
he had a grudge against me?

742
01:18:13,504 --> 01:18:17,998
How could I have known
he was lying to get on my good side?

743
01:18:18,175 --> 01:18:23,169
I said, "George, come on aboard.
Glad to have you."

744
01:18:23,347 --> 01:18:28,148
George thought he was smart,
except he wasn't.

745
01:18:29,086 --> 01:18:32,214
One morning, George rides into camp...

746
01:18:32,389 --> 01:18:34,584
...and about 20 guns open up on him.

747
01:18:38,395 --> 01:18:42,855
See, old George, he only had one eye. You
gotta have two eyes, you wanna get Jesse.

748
01:18:47,705 --> 01:18:50,833
You ought not think of me
like you do George Shepherd.

749
01:18:52,176 --> 01:18:54,406
You brought him to mind.

750
01:18:55,346 --> 01:18:57,644
Well, it's not very flattering.

751
01:19:03,621 --> 01:19:06,419
Sure is good eating, Martha.

752
01:19:07,291 --> 01:19:09,521
Well, I'm so glad you enjoyed it.

753
01:19:09,693 --> 01:19:11,854
How come George
had a grudge against you?

754
01:19:16,767 --> 01:19:20,863
I said, how come George
had a grudge against you?

755
01:19:26,577 --> 01:19:31,310
Well, you see, George had a nephew
he wanted me to protect during the war.

756
01:19:31,482 --> 01:19:33,712
This nephew had 5000 dollars on him.

757
01:19:33,884 --> 01:19:38,480
It just so happens he winds up killed
and someone swipes that money.

758
01:19:38,656 --> 01:19:42,524
And when George is in prison,
someone whispers to him:

759
01:19:42,693 --> 01:19:46,424
"It was Jesse James
slit the boy's throat."

760
01:19:51,168 --> 01:19:53,636
It was just mean gossip, was it?

761
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:58,738
Bob's the expert. Let's put it to him.

762
01:20:03,814 --> 01:20:06,214
Oh, dear, I made him cranky.

763
01:20:06,383 --> 01:20:10,183
I'm not cranky. I just been
through this before is all.

764
01:20:10,354 --> 01:20:13,517
Most people get around on making fun
of me. They don't ever let up.

765
01:20:13,691 --> 01:20:15,750
Someone's getting awful fresh over there.

766
01:20:15,926 --> 01:20:18,622
Woman, shut your face for once.

767
01:20:25,636 --> 01:20:27,968
Don't want you to skip off
to your room and pout...

768
01:20:28,138 --> 01:20:30,663
...without knowing why I come by
for this visit.

769
01:20:31,475 --> 01:20:33,705
Why? So you could
tell us how sorry you are...

770
01:20:33,877 --> 01:20:36,437
...you had to slap our cousin Albert around?

771
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:51,891
I come by...

772
01:20:52,062 --> 01:20:55,463
...to ask if one of you two Fords...

773
01:20:55,666 --> 01:20:59,033
...would care to ride with me
in a journey or two.

774
01:20:59,436 --> 01:21:02,803
I guess we both agree
it ought to be Charley.

775
01:21:02,973 --> 01:21:05,771
You've been acting sort of testy.

776
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:38,970
Have you seen Wood Hite lately?

777
01:21:39,476 --> 01:21:43,003
No. Not at all.

778
01:21:50,988 --> 01:21:53,650
I swear that stew
had some squirrel meat in it.

779
01:21:53,824 --> 01:21:56,520
- Still arguing with you, is it?
- Yeah.

780
01:21:57,294 --> 01:21:59,228
- You're Charles Ford?
- Yes, ma'am.

781
01:21:59,396 --> 01:22:01,455
You've seen me once or twice before.

782
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,734
I got a letter from George Hite.

783
01:22:05,369 --> 01:22:08,270
He hasn't seen hide nor hair of him.

784
01:22:09,773 --> 01:22:11,968
And you say you haven't seen Wood?

785
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:15,873
No, l... I can't imagine where he could be.

786
01:22:43,274 --> 01:22:44,298
Yeah?

787
01:22:45,476 --> 01:22:47,637
You finished with your sleeping?

788
01:22:49,146 --> 01:22:51,671
I could use a couple more hours
if it's no trouble.

789
01:23:03,327 --> 01:23:04,885
Yeah.

790
01:23:08,532 --> 01:23:12,969
I been holding a discussion with myself
over if I ought to tell you this or no.

791
01:23:13,137 --> 01:23:15,799
My good side won out and...

792
01:23:17,008 --> 01:23:19,909
Well, I wanna make a clean breast
of things.

793
01:23:21,012 --> 01:23:25,176
Yeah, my mind's a little cobwebby
is the only drawback.

794
01:23:25,349 --> 01:23:30,150
I could use a little...
A little more sleep.

795
01:23:32,690 --> 01:23:34,715
You know I went to Kentucky?

796
01:23:35,693 --> 01:23:37,126
Yeah.

797
01:23:37,828 --> 01:23:40,262
I come back through Saline County and...

798
01:23:41,665 --> 01:23:43,530
...I think to myself:

799
01:23:44,068 --> 01:23:48,835
"Why not stop by and see Ed Miller?"

800
01:23:51,008 --> 01:23:52,737
So I do.

801
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:59,913
Well, things are not to my satisfaction.

802
01:24:02,053 --> 01:24:04,817
Ed's got himself all worked up
over something.

803
01:24:06,357 --> 01:24:09,622
I can see that he's lying like a rug.

804
01:24:12,963 --> 01:24:16,057
So I say to myself, "Enough's enough."

805
01:24:16,567 --> 01:24:19,365
And I say to Ed, "Come on, Ed.

806
01:24:20,304 --> 01:24:22,636
Let's go for a ride."

807
01:24:24,442 --> 01:24:27,343
You understand what I'm saying?

808
01:24:28,579 --> 01:24:31,548
Going for a ride is like...

809
01:24:32,616 --> 01:24:35,744
Going for a ride
is like giving him what-for?

810
01:24:37,721 --> 01:24:39,450
Exactly.

811
01:24:43,928 --> 01:24:45,395
So...

812
01:24:48,099 --> 01:24:49,964
...Ed and Jesse...

813
01:24:52,369 --> 01:24:54,633
...they argue on the road.

814
01:24:59,076 --> 01:25:01,408
Did you ever count the stars?

815
01:25:04,882 --> 01:25:08,818
I can't ever get the same number.
They keep changing on me.

816
01:25:10,688 --> 01:25:13,714
I don't even know what a star is exactly.

817
01:25:16,427 --> 01:25:18,622
Well, your body knows.

818
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:21,998
It's your mind that forgot.

819
01:25:31,775 --> 01:25:34,835
You go on ahead, partner.
I'll catch up with you.

820
01:26:15,052 --> 01:26:16,883
It's okay.

821
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:43,168
It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.

822
01:26:46,183 --> 01:26:48,651
And when push came to shove...

823
01:26:55,526 --> 01:26:57,926
...Jesse shot and killed him.

824
01:27:01,265 --> 01:27:03,130
Jesse did.

825
01:27:05,603 --> 01:27:07,332
You got it.

826
01:27:09,373 --> 01:27:10,738
You...

827
01:27:27,324 --> 01:27:29,292
So, you see, your...

828
01:27:29,493 --> 01:27:31,961
Your cousin, he got off easy.

829
01:27:32,129 --> 01:27:33,721
I was just playing with Albert.

830
01:27:35,232 --> 01:27:38,895
Yeah, I made him squeal
once or twice myself.

831
01:27:39,203 --> 01:27:42,263
I'm just not as thorough as you are.

832
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:56,576
You got a tale to swap with me now?

833
01:28:05,362 --> 01:28:07,762
I don't get your meaning.

834
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:15,135
Seems to me, if you have something
to confess in exchange...

835
01:28:15,306 --> 01:28:17,467
...it'd only be right...

836
01:28:18,375 --> 01:28:21,708
...that you'd spit it out now.

837
01:28:33,524 --> 01:28:35,651
I can't think of a single thing.

838
01:28:38,562 --> 01:28:41,326
About Wood Hite, for example.

839
01:28:41,498 --> 01:28:46,333
I'm not gonna... I been saying over and
over I can't figure out where he's gone.

840
01:28:46,503 --> 01:28:49,563
Now, I'm not gonna change my story
just to have something to spit.

841
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:52,436
- Why was your brother so agitated?
- Which?

842
01:28:53,410 --> 01:28:54,502
Bob.

843
01:28:55,879 --> 01:28:58,871
That's just his way. He's antsy.

844
01:28:59,650 --> 01:29:01,083
You know?

845
01:29:17,267 --> 01:29:19,861
You go on back to sleep now.

846
01:29:21,505 --> 01:29:24,633
You got me agitated now, you see?

847
01:29:31,048 --> 01:29:35,246
Yeah, just ain't no peace
when old Jesse's around.

848
01:29:35,786 --> 01:29:38,778
You ought to pity my poor wife.

849
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:43,619
Ed Miller was a good friend of mine.

850
01:29:43,794 --> 01:29:47,230
He introduced me to you
at that one poker game.

851
01:29:47,965 --> 01:29:51,992
I'm a little angry with you, if you
wanna know the God's honest truth.

852
01:29:54,471 --> 01:29:56,962
You ought to pity me too.

853
01:30:42,519 --> 01:30:46,455
As proof of his confederacy with
the James Gang, Bob told the authorities...

854
01:30:46,623 --> 01:30:50,115
...that Dick Liddil was sleeping over
at the rented farmhouse...

855
01:30:50,294 --> 01:30:53,127
...while his ruined leg mended.

856
01:30:58,135 --> 01:31:01,969
And then, created a map
of the Harbison property...

857
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:08,373
...leaving out the creek where
Wood Hite's remains now moldered.

858
01:31:09,146 --> 01:31:11,341
Right, you boys are cornered!

859
01:31:11,515 --> 01:31:16,043
Come on out peaceably
and nobody'll get shot up!

860
01:31:21,191 --> 01:31:22,215
Don't shoot!

861
01:31:26,830 --> 01:31:28,821
Come on out and show yourself!

862
01:31:43,881 --> 01:31:45,405
Hello.

863
01:31:45,749 --> 01:31:47,376
We got him.

864
01:31:47,784 --> 01:31:49,809
Give me that Colt, son.

865
01:31:54,758 --> 01:31:57,318
- All right.
- Andrew James Liddil...

866
01:31:57,494 --> 01:32:00,486
...I have a warrant here
for your arrest...

867
01:32:00,664 --> 01:32:05,033
Snowstorms would move over Missouri
that Sunday, February 19th...

868
01:32:05,202 --> 01:32:08,194
...shutting down commerce
for more than two days.

869
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:12,570
- Go, go, go.
- Are the papers here?

870
01:32:12,743 --> 01:32:16,372
- He wanted to know if the papers are here.
- I don't care what he wants.

871
01:32:16,547 --> 01:32:18,412
Yet this wouldn't prevent Robert Ford...

872
01:32:18,582 --> 01:32:20,982
...from presenting himself
to Governor Crittenden...

873
01:32:21,151 --> 01:32:24,245
...at the Craig Rifles Ball on Wednesday.

874
01:32:24,421 --> 01:32:27,982
I deem it a great privilege
on this glorious occasion...

875
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:30,149
...to recognize publicly...

876
01:32:30,327 --> 01:32:32,989
...the intelligent and effective assistance...

877
01:32:33,163 --> 01:32:37,964
...that Captain Henry Craig has rendered
the state of Missouri and myself...

878
01:32:38,135 --> 01:32:41,593
...in our joint quest
to rid Jackson County...

879
01:32:42,005 --> 01:32:43,973
...of the James band.

880
01:32:44,141 --> 01:32:46,769
The task that Captain Craig
has assumed...

881
01:32:46,944 --> 01:32:51,074
...will require fearless courage,
extraordinary vigilance...

882
01:32:51,248 --> 01:32:54,183
...and an unerring selection
of instrumentalities.

883
01:32:55,352 --> 01:33:00,016
Well, I've gotten the signal from my wife
that enough is enough.

884
01:33:00,190 --> 01:33:02,556
However, before I sit...

885
01:33:02,726 --> 01:33:05,854
...I would like to ask you
to join me in a toast...

886
01:33:06,296 --> 01:33:09,993
...to a great son
of the state of Missouri...

887
01:33:10,167 --> 01:33:14,001
...my friend, Henry Craig.
- Here, here.

888
01:33:26,683 --> 01:33:28,310
Yes.

889
01:33:29,286 --> 01:33:31,117
Just let my attorney know.

890
01:33:38,762 --> 01:33:42,027
Who is that? Who is it?

891
01:33:42,366 --> 01:33:43,924
Get out of the way now.

892
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:58,006
You know, you're more goddamn trouble
than you're worth, Bob.

893
01:33:58,181 --> 01:33:59,876
I was just gonna say hello.

894
01:34:00,050 --> 01:34:03,281
No, you weren't gonna do that, Bob.
That's not why you're down here.

895
01:34:03,453 --> 01:34:08,720
You think it's your goddamn coming-out.
You think you're the belle of the ball.

896
01:34:08,892 --> 01:34:13,124
Now you get upstairs and try to keep your
identity secret, you silly little bastard.

897
01:34:13,296 --> 01:34:16,163
The governor'll see you in good time.
Take him up, boys.

898
01:34:21,672 --> 01:34:23,799
Bob would later be cross-examined
repeatedly...

899
01:34:23,974 --> 01:34:28,172
...about the exact nature of the deal
he had made with the authorities.

900
01:34:28,345 --> 01:34:31,280
And he was never consistent
in his recollections.

901
01:34:35,452 --> 01:34:39,684
My wife's asleep in the other room,
so let's speak as quietly as we can.

902
01:34:40,357 --> 01:34:42,587
So you're Dick Little.

903
01:34:44,461 --> 01:34:45,985
Liddil.

904
01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:48,664
I beg your pardon?

905
01:34:48,965 --> 01:34:50,557
I spell it with two D's.

906
01:34:50,734 --> 01:34:53,100
He's given us a full confession, governor.

907
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:55,363
Newspapers haven't caught onto it yet.

908
01:34:55,539 --> 01:34:59,066
And you've guaranteed him
a conditional pardon...

909
01:34:59,242 --> 01:35:03,110
...and amnesty for all the robberies
he's committed.

910
01:35:04,748 --> 01:35:05,976
You Robert Ford?

911
01:35:09,486 --> 01:35:10,783
How old are you?

912
01:35:12,856 --> 01:35:14,289
Twenty.

913
01:35:14,591 --> 01:35:17,116
You surrender to Sheriff Timberlake
as well?

914
01:35:17,294 --> 01:35:21,196
No, no, governor. That's his brother,
Charley Ford, he's in the James Gang.

915
01:35:21,364 --> 01:35:24,094
But little Bob here,
we got nothing on Bob.

916
01:35:24,267 --> 01:35:26,827
He's just acting in capacity as a...

917
01:35:29,039 --> 01:35:31,200
...private detective.

918
01:35:32,375 --> 01:35:34,400
Jesse James sent me a telegram
last month...

919
01:35:34,578 --> 01:35:37,741
...saying he'd kill me
if he had to wreck a train to do it.

920
01:35:37,914 --> 01:35:40,542
He said once I got in his hands,
he'd cut my heart out...

921
01:35:40,717 --> 01:35:43,208
...and eat it in strips like it was bacon.

922
01:35:43,386 --> 01:35:45,320
I'll wreck his train first.

923
01:35:52,896 --> 01:35:57,060
I'm sorry, Your Excellency.
I was thinking about something else.

924
01:35:57,234 --> 01:35:59,566
Jesse James is nothing more
than a public outlaw...

925
01:35:59,736 --> 01:36:02,534
...who made his reputation
by stealing whatever he wanted...

926
01:36:02,706 --> 01:36:04,936
...killing whoever got in his way.

927
01:36:05,108 --> 01:36:08,703
You'll hear some fools say he's getting back
at Republicans and Union men...

928
01:36:08,879 --> 01:36:11,643
...for the wrongs his family suffered
during the war.

929
01:36:11,815 --> 01:36:16,548
But his victims have scarcely been selected
with reference to their political views.

930
01:36:17,053 --> 01:36:19,749
I'm saying his sins will soon find him out.

931
01:36:19,923 --> 01:36:22,585
I'm saying his cup of iniquity is full.

932
01:36:22,759 --> 01:36:25,455
I'm saying Jesse James
is a desperate case...

933
01:36:25,762 --> 01:36:28,663
...and may require a desperate remedy.

934
01:36:32,002 --> 01:36:35,096
Y'all got the right man for the job.

935
01:36:51,454 --> 01:36:53,718
Come on. Come on, now.

936
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:55,918
Come on, now.

937
01:37:40,303 --> 01:37:42,863
Have you ever considered suicide?

938
01:37:44,908 --> 01:37:50,244
I can't say that I have. There's always
something else I wanted to do.

939
01:37:51,314 --> 01:37:57,184
Or my predicaments changed,
or I saw my hardships from a different slant.

940
01:37:57,354 --> 01:38:01,757
You know all what can happen.
It never seemed respectable.

941
01:38:08,531 --> 01:38:11,364
I'll tell you one thing that's for certain.

942
01:38:11,534 --> 01:38:15,493
You won't mind dying
once you've peeked over the other side.

943
01:38:19,276 --> 01:38:22,302
You'll no more wanna go back
to your body than...

944
01:38:22,479 --> 01:38:24,947
...you'd wanna spoon up your own puke.

945
01:38:31,454 --> 01:38:34,252
Hey, since we're looking to rob banks...

946
01:38:34,424 --> 01:38:39,020
...I was wondering if we could
add another fella to the gang...

947
01:38:39,195 --> 01:38:42,824
...and sort of see if we couldn't
come out of our next job alive.

948
01:38:45,302 --> 01:38:50,296
Bob wanted to know could he ride with us
next time we took on a savings bank or...

949
01:38:56,613 --> 01:38:59,081
A savings bank or a...

950
01:39:00,817 --> 01:39:02,546
A railroad.

951
01:39:09,926 --> 01:39:13,225
Bob isn't much more than a boy
to most appearances.

952
01:39:13,396 --> 01:39:16,160
But there's about two tons
of sand in him.

953
01:39:16,333 --> 01:39:19,564
And he'll stand with a shooter
when that's what's called for.

954
01:39:19,736 --> 01:39:24,002
And he's smart too.
He's about as intricate as they come.

955
01:39:26,109 --> 01:39:28,839
You forget I already met the kid.

956
01:39:30,146 --> 01:39:32,876
Hell, he surely thinks highly of you.

957
01:39:33,416 --> 01:39:36,180
All of America thinks highly of me.

958
01:39:36,886 --> 01:39:40,117
Still, not like you got two million names
to snatch out of a sock...

959
01:39:40,290 --> 01:39:42,451
...whenever you need a third man.

960
01:39:45,962 --> 01:39:48,988
I can see you trying to
wear me down on this.

961
01:39:49,165 --> 01:39:51,360
That's my main intention.

962
01:40:00,443 --> 01:40:03,105
Robberies would be conceived
but never carried out...

963
01:40:03,279 --> 01:40:06,840
...in Nebraska, Colorado and Missouri.

964
01:40:07,484 --> 01:40:08,576
During this time...

965
01:40:08,752 --> 01:40:12,779
...Henry Craig enjoined Robert Ford to return
to Elias' Grocery Store in Richmond...

966
01:40:12,956 --> 01:40:16,016
...and await instructions
from Sheriff James Timberlake.

967
01:40:16,459 --> 01:40:18,723
All right, three cans...

968
01:40:18,895 --> 01:40:22,626
...peaches. Two cans...

969
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:26,425
Two cans sifted peas.

970
01:40:26,736 --> 01:40:28,363
One bottle...

971
01:40:31,174 --> 01:40:34,371
...Mary's Morning Tonic, and a half...

972
01:40:37,447 --> 01:40:40,007
Half a sack of flour.

973
01:40:41,184 --> 01:40:43,243
I'll be right with you.

974
01:40:59,235 --> 01:41:01,567
I haven't seen any sign of him.

975
01:41:03,039 --> 01:41:05,405
Well, do you know where he's living?

976
01:41:06,509 --> 01:41:07,874
No.

977
01:41:09,045 --> 01:41:10,478
No?

978
01:41:13,216 --> 01:41:15,980
Well, I can't guess how he does it...

979
01:41:16,152 --> 01:41:20,452
...but he is always knowledgeable
about what's going on.

980
01:41:20,623 --> 01:41:24,923
He's gonna know I've been here with you.
You ought to take that for granted.

981
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:31,389
And he will kill you if he gets the chance.

982
01:41:34,637 --> 01:41:37,197
Are you willing to risk that?

983
01:41:41,811 --> 01:41:43,540
Yes, I am.

984
01:41:46,616 --> 01:41:48,345
I've been a nobody all my life.

985
01:41:49,285 --> 01:41:51,116
I was the baby.

986
01:41:51,387 --> 01:41:54,823
I was the one they made promises to
that they never kept.

987
01:41:56,025 --> 01:42:00,724
And ever since I can remember it,
Jesse James has been as big as a tree.

988
01:42:04,167 --> 01:42:06,431
I'm prepared for this, Jim...

989
01:42:07,337 --> 01:42:09,498
...and I'm gonna accomplish it.

990
01:42:09,739 --> 01:42:11,832
I know I won't get
but this one opportunity...

991
01:42:12,008 --> 01:42:14,909
...and you can bet your life
I'm not gonna spoil it.

992
01:42:26,923 --> 01:42:27,981
Well...

993
01:42:29,192 --> 01:42:31,183
...wait for your chance.

994
01:42:31,694 --> 01:42:35,095
Don't let yourself be found alone with him,
and do not...

995
01:42:35,965 --> 01:42:38,365
...let him get behind you.

996
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,690
You been chosen.

997
01:43:12,669 --> 01:43:14,261
Well, what do you mean?

998
01:43:15,538 --> 01:43:18,029
Well, your brother said that
you might wanna join us.

999
01:43:18,208 --> 01:43:21,541
But maybe you like this grocery store
more than you said you did.

1000
01:43:24,847 --> 01:43:26,906
- So you missed me?
- Oh, yeah.

1001
01:43:27,584 --> 01:43:30,246
I been crying myself to sleep every night.

1002
01:43:39,796 --> 01:43:41,787
Don't let him see us so much as wink.

1003
01:43:41,965 --> 01:43:45,799
He's suspicious as a damn coyote,
and he don't trust you one iota.

1004
01:43:46,502 --> 01:43:48,299
- Well, I guess that makes...
- Hey.

1005
01:43:48,471 --> 01:43:52,931
He already put away Ed Miller. He said so
like it was something piddly he'd done.

1006
01:44:33,916 --> 01:44:38,148
If we're ever alone for more than a minute,
I'd like a chance to talk to you further.

1007
01:45:17,894 --> 01:45:20,124
They gave me ten days.

1008
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,524
For what?

1009
01:45:27,503 --> 01:45:29,368
For arresting him.

1010
01:45:35,445 --> 01:45:37,106
You and me, huh?

1011
01:45:40,750 --> 01:45:44,015
It's gonna happen one way or another,
Charley. It's gonna happen.

1012
01:45:44,187 --> 01:45:46,781
So it might as well be us
who get rich on it.

1013
01:45:46,956 --> 01:45:50,255
- Bob, he's our friend.
- He murdered Ed Miller.

1014
01:45:50,893 --> 01:45:53,987
And he's gonna murder Liddil and Cummins
if the chance ever comes.

1015
01:45:55,431 --> 01:46:00,061
It seems to me Jesse's riding from
man to man, saying goodbye to the gang.

1016
01:46:01,571 --> 01:46:03,937
So your friendship could put you
under the pansies.

1017
01:46:06,008 --> 01:46:10,468
I'll grind it fine in my mind, Bob. I can't
go any further than that right now.

1018
01:46:14,050 --> 01:46:15,483
You'll come around.

1019
01:46:16,619 --> 01:46:19,087
You think it's all made up, don't you?

1020
01:46:19,255 --> 01:46:22,588
You think it's all yarns
and newspaper stories.

1021
01:46:30,466 --> 01:46:32,798
He's just a human being.

1022
01:46:41,043 --> 01:46:44,171
From now on, you two
won't go anywhere without me.

1023
01:46:44,947 --> 01:46:49,509
From now on, you'll ask for my permission!
From now on, you'll ask to be excused!

1024
01:47:45,441 --> 01:47:49,741
Charley, take them horses
around the barn. Bob, you go on inside.

1025
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:51,911
- Hello, Mary.
- Hi.

1026
01:47:52,081 --> 01:47:55,244
Look at this rotten parsnip
I found in the compost heap.

1027
01:48:05,461 --> 01:48:07,361
You never mentioned Bob would be here.

1028
01:48:11,634 --> 01:48:14,626
Maybe he was saving it
as a pleasant surprise.

1029
01:48:19,242 --> 01:48:21,904
Got two cousins for company now.

1030
01:48:31,621 --> 01:48:33,919
How it's gonna be is...

1031
01:48:34,290 --> 01:48:38,488
...we'll leave next Monday afternoon
and ride down to Platte City.

1032
01:48:41,364 --> 01:48:43,298
How far is that from Kansas City?

1033
01:48:45,001 --> 01:48:47,834
Platte City's 30 miles south.

1034
01:48:49,472 --> 01:48:54,068
You and me and Charley'll
sleep in the woods overnight...

1035
01:48:54,577 --> 01:48:58,980
...and we'll strike the Wells Bank
sometime before the court recesses.

1036
01:49:03,786 --> 01:49:06,721
What time will that be exactly?

1037
01:49:12,361 --> 01:49:14,886
Well, you don't need to know that.

1038
01:49:29,912 --> 01:49:32,881
You know, I'm real comfortable
with your brother.

1039
01:49:33,115 --> 01:49:35,640
Hell, he's ugly as sin,
he smells like a skunk...

1040
01:49:36,452 --> 01:49:39,888
...and he's so ignorant
he couldn't drive nails in the snow...

1041
01:49:40,056 --> 01:49:42,547
...but he's sort of easy to be around.

1042
01:49:43,059 --> 01:49:45,857
I can't say the same for you, Bob.

1043
01:49:49,265 --> 01:49:51,631
Well, I'm sorry to hear you say that.

1044
01:49:53,502 --> 01:49:57,529
You know how it is when you're
with your girlfriend and the moon's out...

1045
01:49:57,707 --> 01:50:01,768
...and you know she wants to be kissed,
even though she never said so?

1046
01:50:05,181 --> 01:50:06,614
Yeah.

1047
01:50:09,352 --> 01:50:12,719
Well, you're giving me signs
that grieve my soul...

1048
01:50:13,589 --> 01:50:15,716
...and make me wonder...

1049
01:50:16,125 --> 01:50:18,491
...maybe your mind's
been changed about me.

1050
01:50:18,828 --> 01:50:22,286
Well, what do you want me to do?
Swear my good faith on the Bible?

1051
01:50:39,782 --> 01:50:41,716
You two having a spat?

1052
01:50:46,989 --> 01:50:49,480
I was getting ready to be angry.

1053
01:50:54,964 --> 01:50:57,296
Sit over here closer, kid.

1054
01:50:59,535 --> 01:51:00,797
Come on.

1055
01:51:11,947 --> 01:51:14,279
Charley, you'll stay with the animals.

1056
01:51:14,950 --> 01:51:16,850
Me and the kid...

1057
01:51:17,019 --> 01:51:20,978
...will walk into that bank
just before noon.

1058
01:51:22,858 --> 01:51:25,486
Bob will move that cashier...

1059
01:51:26,028 --> 01:51:29,259
...away from the shotgun
that's under the counter...

1060
01:51:29,432 --> 01:51:32,299
...and I'll creep up behind that cashier...

1061
01:51:32,468 --> 01:51:34,800
...and I'll cock his head back like so.

1062
01:51:35,071 --> 01:51:36,095
And I'll say:

1063
01:51:36,272 --> 01:51:39,002
"How come an off-scouring
like you is still sucking air...

1064
01:51:39,175 --> 01:51:41,439
...when so many of mine
are in coffins?" I'll say:

1065
01:51:41,610 --> 01:51:44,943
"How did you get to reach 20
without leaking out all over your clothes?"

1066
01:51:45,414 --> 01:51:49,282
And if I don't like his attitude,
I will slit that phildoodle so deep...

1067
01:51:49,585 --> 01:51:52,611
...he will flop on the floor like a fish.

1068
01:51:56,292 --> 01:51:58,658
My God, what just happened?

1069
01:52:07,903 --> 01:52:11,270
Boy, I could hear your gears grinding...

1070
01:52:11,574 --> 01:52:14,941
...hear your little motor wondering,
"My gosh, what's next?

1071
01:52:15,111 --> 01:52:16,476
What's happening to me?"

1072
01:52:18,347 --> 01:52:20,212
You were precious to behold, Bob.

1073
01:52:20,382 --> 01:52:23,010
You were white as spit in a cotton field.

1074
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:26,020
You got him. You got him.

1075
01:52:27,656 --> 01:52:31,717
You wanna know how that feels?
Unpleasant. I honestly can't recommend it.

1076
01:52:37,233 --> 01:52:39,701
The old Charley looked stricken!

1077
01:52:40,369 --> 01:52:42,200
I was. I was.

1078
01:52:42,371 --> 01:52:47,365
"This is plumb unexpected," old Charley
was thinking. "That done ruined my day."

1079
01:52:55,151 --> 01:52:56,584
Hell. Hell.

1080
01:53:27,550 --> 01:53:31,418
Jesse slept with Bob
in the children's room that night.

1081
01:53:32,721 --> 01:53:35,315
And Bob remained awake.

1082
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:41,527
He could see that there was a gun
on the nightstand.

1083
01:53:42,398 --> 01:53:46,391
He could imagine its cold nickel
inside his grip...

1084
01:53:47,303 --> 01:53:50,795
...its two-pound weight
reached out and aimed.

1085
01:54:21,937 --> 01:54:24,030
I need to go to the privy.

1086
01:54:25,241 --> 01:54:28,642
You think you do, but you don't.

1087
01:54:51,867 --> 01:54:54,028
You wait for grace, now.

1088
01:54:54,970 --> 01:54:58,303
- Thank you, Mama.
- Thank you, Zee. God, that looks good.

1089
01:54:58,474 --> 01:55:00,101
- Thank you, Zee.
- You're welcome.

1090
01:55:00,276 --> 01:55:03,370
Well, is this fit to eat or will it just do?

1091
01:55:06,282 --> 01:55:08,375
Woman's cooking's
always been a scandal.

1092
01:55:08,550 --> 01:55:10,916
Cut her meat and the whole table moves.

1093
01:55:11,854 --> 01:55:13,913
You want a biscuit?
You gonna have a biscuit?

1094
01:55:14,089 --> 01:55:17,889
Here's some butter.
Come on. Come on.

1095
01:55:19,828 --> 01:55:21,125
Oh, shoot.

1096
01:55:21,297 --> 01:55:25,097
And so it went,
Jesse was increasingly cavalier...

1097
01:55:25,267 --> 01:55:28,998
...merry, moody, fey...

1098
01:55:29,171 --> 01:55:31,264
...unpredictable.

1099
01:55:32,808 --> 01:55:35,936
He camouflaged his depressions
and derangements...

1100
01:55:36,111 --> 01:55:40,104
...with masquerades
of extreme cordiality, courtesy...

1101
01:55:40,282 --> 01:55:43,046
...and goodwill towards others.

1102
01:55:44,119 --> 01:55:48,385
But even as he jested,
or tickled his boy in the ribs...

1103
01:55:48,557 --> 01:55:52,186
...Jesse would look over at Bob
with melancholy eyes...

1104
01:55:52,361 --> 01:55:56,320
...as if the two were meshed
in an intimate communication.

1105
01:55:59,134 --> 01:56:01,762
Bob was certain that the man
had unriddled him...

1106
01:56:01,937 --> 01:56:04,599
...had seen through his reasons
for coming along...

1107
01:56:04,773 --> 01:56:08,766
...that Jesse could forecast each of
Bob's possible moves and inclinations...

1108
01:56:08,944 --> 01:56:10,775
...and was only acting the innocent...

1109
01:56:10,946 --> 01:56:15,883
...in order to lull Bob
into stupid tranquility and miscalculation.

1110
01:56:37,573 --> 01:56:39,768
How long you been studying me?

1111
01:56:41,677 --> 01:56:44,407
You're gonna break a lot of hearts.

1112
01:56:52,321 --> 01:56:53,515
How do you mean?

1113
01:57:02,765 --> 01:57:04,494
It's a present.

1114
01:57:09,171 --> 01:57:10,729
It's heavy.

1115
01:57:11,306 --> 01:57:13,433
Well, you gonna look inside?

1116
01:57:15,010 --> 01:57:16,807
It's April Fools' Day, you know.

1117
01:57:17,379 --> 01:57:19,210
It ain't no joke.

1118
01:57:26,722 --> 01:57:28,280
Oh, such extravagance.

1119
01:57:29,825 --> 01:57:32,521
Don't that nickel just shine, though?

1120
01:57:32,728 --> 01:57:34,286
It's more than I could hope for.

1121
01:57:34,463 --> 01:57:37,261
I figured that granddaddy Colt
may blow into fragments...

1122
01:57:37,433 --> 01:57:40,197
...next time you try
to squeeze the trigger.

1123
01:57:40,436 --> 01:57:42,836
Well, you might have something there.

1124
01:57:43,338 --> 01:57:45,966
Tom, supper's ready.

1125
01:57:47,142 --> 01:57:49,167
I'll be right there, sweetheart.

1126
01:57:49,344 --> 01:57:51,642
I might be too excited to eat.

1127
01:57:54,917 --> 01:57:57,408
You know what John Newman Edwards
once wrote about me?

1128
01:57:58,454 --> 01:58:01,287
He said I didn't trust
two men in 10,000...

1129
01:58:01,457 --> 01:58:04,119
...and even them I was cautious around.

1130
01:58:04,927 --> 01:58:06,918
Government's sort of run me ragged.

1131
01:58:08,897 --> 01:58:11,889
I'm going the long way around the barn
to say that...

1132
01:58:12,067 --> 01:58:15,696
...I been feeling cornered
and just plain ornery as of late...

1133
01:58:16,438 --> 01:58:21,102
...and I'd be pleased if you'd accept
that gun as my way of apologizing.

1134
01:58:23,479 --> 01:58:26,277
Heaven knows I'd be ornerier
if I were in your position.

1135
01:58:26,448 --> 01:58:29,542
No. No, I haven't been acting correctly.

1136
01:58:31,353 --> 01:58:34,880
Seems I hardly recognize myself
when I'm greased.

1137
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:40,451
I go on journeys out of my body...

1138
01:58:40,629 --> 01:58:44,725
...and look at my red hands
and my mean face...

1139
01:58:45,501 --> 01:58:49,232
...and I wonder about that man
that's gone so wrong.

1140
01:58:53,008 --> 01:58:56,034
I've been becoming a problem to myself.

1141
01:59:08,690 --> 01:59:10,055
Well...

1142
01:59:16,698 --> 01:59:21,328
- I better wash my hands if supper's on.
- Yeah, go ahead.

1143
01:59:34,683 --> 01:59:37,618
The day before he died was Palm Sunday.

1144
01:59:38,654 --> 01:59:41,953
And Mr. And Mrs. Thomas Howard,
their two children...

1145
01:59:42,124 --> 01:59:44,183
...and their cousin Charles Johnson...

1146
01:59:44,359 --> 01:59:49,524
...strolled to the Second Presbyterian
Church to attend the 10:00 service.

1147
01:59:51,934 --> 01:59:54,232
Bob remained at the cottage...

1148
01:59:54,403 --> 01:59:57,804
...and slyly migrated from room to room.

1149
02:00:00,409 --> 02:00:02,240
He walked into the master bedroom...

1150
02:00:02,411 --> 02:00:06,177
...and inventoried the clothes
on the hangers and hooks.

1151
02:00:12,487 --> 02:00:15,820
He sipped from the water glass
on the vanity.

1152
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:22,426
He smelled the talcum and lilacs
on Jesse's pillowcase.

1153
02:00:30,339 --> 02:00:32,534
His fingers skittered over his ribs...

1154
02:00:32,708 --> 02:00:36,576
...to construe the scars
where Jesse was twice shot.

1155
02:00:40,382 --> 02:00:44,978
He manufactured a middle finger
that was missing the top two knuckles.

1156
02:00:52,427 --> 02:00:55,362
He imagined himself at 34.

1157
02:00:57,366 --> 02:01:00,358
He imagined himself in a coffin.

1158
02:01:02,437 --> 02:01:04,166
He considered possibilities...

1159
02:01:04,339 --> 02:01:07,638
...and everything wonderful
that could come true.

1160
02:01:35,437 --> 02:01:37,371
He's not gonna kill us.

1161
02:01:42,611 --> 02:01:44,772
Yeah, he is.

1162
02:01:47,082 --> 02:01:49,573
Well, I'll stay awake so he can't.

1163
02:02:02,931 --> 02:02:05,365
You're imagining things.

1164
02:02:17,612 --> 02:02:19,580
Ain't gonna be no Platte City.

1165
02:02:21,316 --> 02:02:23,944
That's Jesse fooling with us.

1166
02:02:40,369 --> 02:02:42,599
Go to sleep, Charley.

1167
02:03:16,204 --> 02:03:17,796
Morning.

1168
02:03:21,610 --> 02:03:23,134
Charley.

1169
02:03:52,974 --> 02:03:55,408
Bob, how much did you want to eat?

1170
02:03:59,915 --> 02:04:02,349
I'm feeling sort of peculiar.

1171
02:04:21,570 --> 02:04:24,038
Why is it you're looking so interested?

1172
02:04:25,507 --> 02:04:28,408
You think it's intelligent
to go out like that...

1173
02:04:28,577 --> 02:04:30,408
...so all creation can see your guns?

1174
02:04:48,163 --> 02:04:49,596
Hi.

1175
02:04:59,908 --> 02:05:02,809
Come on, let's go see
what your mama's doing.

1176
02:05:03,945 --> 02:05:06,072
Timmy, get that door, would you?

1177
02:05:10,218 --> 02:05:13,381
- Well, you lost your shoe, sweetheart.
- Yeah, I did.

1178
02:05:13,555 --> 02:05:17,685
That's gonna be a problem.
They don't sell those one at a time.

1179
02:05:19,194 --> 02:05:21,253
We lost a shoe, Mama.

1180
02:05:22,864 --> 02:05:25,424
Will you put that up for Daddy,
would you?

1181
02:05:28,503 --> 02:05:31,267
- What you doing, you lose a shoe?
- Yeah.

1182
02:05:47,989 --> 02:05:51,390
It's only meant to go on top,
to complement.

1183
02:05:51,660 --> 02:05:53,491
Yeah, I know. Sometimes, l...

1184
02:06:18,086 --> 02:06:20,987
Bob, everything's getting cold!

1185
02:06:21,690 --> 02:06:25,091
- Where's Mary?
- She's outside, darling.

1186
02:06:26,094 --> 02:06:27,891
Mary?

1187
02:06:31,666 --> 02:06:34,191
What do you think goes on
in that noggin of his?

1188
02:06:37,205 --> 02:06:38,900
Nothing.

1189
02:06:39,474 --> 02:06:42,272
I was talking about his mind, not yours.

1190
02:06:43,211 --> 02:06:44,940
Oh, yeah.

1191
02:06:45,380 --> 02:06:47,075
Oh, I get it.

1192
02:07:42,504 --> 02:07:44,472
Well, hello now.

1193
02:07:44,873 --> 02:07:47,899
"The arrest and confession
of Dick Liddil."

1194
02:07:53,148 --> 02:07:55,309
You don't say so.

1195
02:08:09,631 --> 02:08:11,724
That's very strange.

1196
02:08:12,167 --> 02:08:15,068
Says here Dick surrendered
three weeks ago.

1197
02:08:15,236 --> 02:08:17,830
You must have been
right in the neighborhood.

1198
02:08:18,506 --> 02:08:21,134
Well, apparently, they kept it a secret.

1199
02:08:32,353 --> 02:08:35,413
If I get to Kansas City soon,
I'll ask somebody about it.

1200
02:09:16,097 --> 02:09:17,792
You two ready?

1201
02:09:21,503 --> 02:09:24,165
I will be, by noon.

1202
02:09:57,071 --> 02:09:59,733
There is a ship
She sails the sea

1203
02:09:59,908 --> 02:10:02,672
She's loaded deep
As deep can be

1204
02:10:02,844 --> 02:10:05,074
But not as deep
As the love I'm in

1205
02:10:05,647 --> 02:10:09,276
I know not if I sink or swim

1206
02:10:10,318 --> 02:10:12,013
The water is wide

1207
02:10:13,154 --> 02:10:19,718
I can't cross o'er
And neither have I wings to fly

1208
02:10:20,161 --> 02:10:23,961
Give me a boat
That can carry two

1209
02:10:24,132 --> 02:10:26,999
Both shall row
My love and I

1210
02:10:27,168 --> 02:10:30,626
For love is gentle
And love is kind

1211
02:10:30,805 --> 02:10:33,797
Sweetest flower
When first it's new

1212
02:10:33,975 --> 02:10:37,570
But love grows old
And waxes cold

1213
02:10:37,745 --> 02:10:40,976
And fades away
Like the morning dew

1214
02:10:41,149 --> 02:10:44,175
There is a ship
She sails the sea

1215
02:10:44,352 --> 02:10:47,116
I guess I'll take my guns off...

1216
02:10:47,455 --> 02:10:49,446
...for fear the neighbors might spy them.

1217
02:11:22,757 --> 02:11:25,191
Don't that picture look dusty?

1218
02:13:07,295 --> 02:13:10,287
What have...? What have you done?

1219
02:13:12,734 --> 02:13:14,361
Jesse.

1220
02:13:19,907 --> 02:13:20,931
Jesse?

1221
02:13:22,076 --> 02:13:24,203
Jesse? Jesse?

1222
02:13:24,946 --> 02:13:26,811
Jesse!

1223
02:13:27,815 --> 02:13:29,908
No!

1224
02:13:34,088 --> 02:13:36,420
No. Jess...

1225
02:13:37,025 --> 02:13:41,428
Come back. Oh, come back.

1226
02:13:43,564 --> 02:13:47,728
Oh, Jesse! No!

1227
02:13:48,236 --> 02:13:52,138
Oh, Bob. Have you done this?!

1228
02:13:52,340 --> 02:13:54,706
I swear to God I didn't.

1229
02:13:55,710 --> 02:13:57,143
It was an accident, Zee.

1230
02:13:59,347 --> 02:14:02,714
Come on. Pistol went off accidentally.

1231
02:14:48,062 --> 02:14:49,256
Put my name.

1232
02:14:49,430 --> 02:14:51,898
Why, what'd you do? I shot him.

1233
02:14:59,107 --> 02:15:01,132
You might wanna keep that.

1234
02:15:39,080 --> 02:15:41,173
Thank you all very much.

1235
02:15:49,323 --> 02:15:51,814
The resulting prints
sold for 2 dollars apiece...

1236
02:15:51,993 --> 02:15:56,589
...and were the models for the lithographed
covers on a number of magazines.

1237
02:16:02,136 --> 02:16:07,335
Soon a thousand strangers were making
spellbound pilgrimages to the cottage...

1238
02:16:07,708 --> 02:16:12,236
...or were venerating the iced remains
in Seidenfaden's cooling room.

1239
02:16:13,147 --> 02:16:17,641
The man who offered 30,000 dollars for
the body of President Garfield's assassin...

1240
02:16:17,818 --> 02:16:21,720
...sent a telegram to City Marshal
Enos Craig offering 50,000...

1241
02:16:21,889 --> 02:16:24,187
...for the body
of Jesse Woodson James...

1242
02:16:24,358 --> 02:16:27,122
...so that he could go around the country
with it...

1243
02:16:29,530 --> 02:16:34,490
...or at least sell it to P.T. Barnum
for his Greatest Show on Earth.

1244
02:16:38,573 --> 02:16:41,667
Another photograph was taken
of the renowned American bandit...

1245
02:16:41,842 --> 02:16:44,436
...nestled in his bed of ice.

1246
02:16:44,612 --> 02:16:48,878
And it was this shot that was most
available in sundries and apothecaries...

1247
02:16:49,050 --> 02:16:52,713
...to be viewed in a stereoscope
alongside the sphinx...

1248
02:16:52,887 --> 02:16:56,880
...the Taj Mahal,
and the catacombs of Rome.

1249
02:17:22,083 --> 02:17:24,051
Hello, here!

1250
02:17:24,252 --> 02:17:26,846
"The arrest and confession
of Dick Liddil."

1251
02:17:27,021 --> 02:17:32,152
Young man, I thought you told me
you didn't know Dick had surrendered.

1252
02:17:32,326 --> 02:17:36,194
You mean he did? I didn't know.

1253
02:17:37,098 --> 02:17:38,998
But I knew I had not fooled him.

1254
02:17:39,166 --> 02:17:43,000
And he knew, as well as I, in that moment
that I intended to bring him to justice.

1255
02:17:43,938 --> 02:17:47,499
But he would not kill me
in the presence of his wife and children.

1256
02:17:47,675 --> 02:17:50,906
And so he was smiling
to throw me off-guard.

1257
02:17:54,148 --> 02:17:56,810
Well, it's all right, anyway, Bob.

1258
02:17:58,686 --> 02:18:01,587
It was widely felt that
Bob possessed some acting talent...

1259
02:18:01,756 --> 02:18:04,020
...and Charley, not a jot.

1260
02:18:04,191 --> 02:18:07,126
That picture's awful dusty.

1261
02:18:07,928 --> 02:18:11,056
Charley was only expected
not to slouch or mutter...

1262
02:18:11,232 --> 02:18:15,896
...and to transport his sicknesses
to the alley before letting them go.

1263
02:18:45,299 --> 02:18:47,164
And that's...

1264
02:18:47,735 --> 02:18:50,397
...how I killed Jesse James.

1265
02:18:53,874 --> 02:18:57,401
By October of 1883, Bob Ford
could be identified correctly...

1266
02:18:57,578 --> 02:19:01,844
...by more citizens than could
the president of the United States.

1267
02:19:02,516 --> 02:19:07,249
He was as renowned at 20 as Jesse was
after 14 years of grand larceny.

1268
02:19:07,421 --> 02:19:09,616
You won't get your hooks into me.

1269
02:19:10,157 --> 02:19:14,890
That's right. That's right.
Sit next to your boyfriend. Jezebel.

1270
02:19:15,062 --> 02:19:17,155
Charley was increasingly superstitious...

1271
02:19:17,331 --> 02:19:20,027
...increasingly subject
to the advice of soothsayers...

1272
02:19:20,201 --> 02:19:24,228
...who promised to cure his miseries
with pipe smoke and poultices.

1273
02:19:24,405 --> 02:19:27,670
You been spending too much time
with Gypsies, Charley.

1274
02:19:33,381 --> 02:19:34,746
Shit.

1275
02:19:39,086 --> 02:19:41,646
The picture's awful dusty.

1276
02:19:42,089 --> 02:19:45,923
Something began to change
in Charley's stage portrayal of Jesse.

1277
02:19:46,093 --> 02:19:48,618
His gait seemed more practiced.

1278
02:19:48,796 --> 02:19:52,095
His voice was spookily similar
to the man's.

1279
02:19:52,266 --> 02:19:54,666
His newly suggested dialogue
was analogous...

1280
02:19:54,835 --> 02:19:57,861
...to a script Jesse might have originated.

1281
02:20:00,674 --> 02:20:03,108
He began to look at his younger brother
with spite...

1282
02:20:03,277 --> 02:20:05,905
...as if he suspected that
in some future performance...

1283
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:10,608
...he might present himself
to a live cartridge in Robert Ford's gun.

1284
02:20:11,952 --> 02:20:13,783
Murderer!

1285
02:20:14,121 --> 02:20:15,850
Cur!

1286
02:20:16,490 --> 02:20:18,253
Coward!

1287
02:20:21,796 --> 02:20:26,324
You wanna investigate my courage?
Do you?

1288
02:20:26,734 --> 02:20:30,500
Find out! Find out!

1289
02:20:35,142 --> 02:20:37,007
Nobody.

1290
02:20:51,592 --> 02:20:53,389
Coward!

1291
02:21:18,586 --> 02:21:24,149
By his own approximation, Bob
assassinated Jesse James over 800 times.

1292
02:21:24,325 --> 02:21:28,091
He suspected no one in history
had ever so often or so publicly...

1293
02:21:28,262 --> 02:21:31,459
...recapitulated an act of betrayal.

1294
02:21:36,670 --> 02:21:39,434
Bob always challenged
the allegations of cowardice...

1295
02:21:39,607 --> 02:21:42,542
...but Charley seemed
to agree with them.

1296
02:21:42,810 --> 02:21:46,576
He spoke of Mrs. Zee James
as certain priests might the Madonna...

1297
02:21:46,747 --> 02:21:49,841
...and composed long soul-describing letters
to her...

1298
02:21:50,017 --> 02:21:52,212
...begging her forgiveness...

1299
02:21:53,521 --> 02:21:56,115
...none of which he mailed.

1300
02:22:23,984 --> 02:22:29,581
Charley Ford became all that his countrymen
wanted an assassin of Jesse James to be.

1301
02:22:33,861 --> 02:22:39,731
Jesse James was a man
Who killed many men

1302
02:22:40,935 --> 02:22:45,372
He robbed the Glendale train

1303
02:22:45,606 --> 02:22:51,442
And he stole from the rich
And he gave to the poor

1304
02:22:51,679 --> 02:22:56,616
He had a hand
And a heart and a brain

1305
02:22:57,418 --> 02:23:02,913
Well, Jesse had a wife
To mourn for his life

1306
02:23:03,090 --> 02:23:08,187
Three children
They were brave

1307
02:23:08,362 --> 02:23:13,959
But that dirty little coward
Who shot Mr. Howard

1308
02:23:14,201 --> 02:23:19,264
Has laid Jesse James in his grave

1309
02:23:20,341 --> 02:23:25,335
It was Robert Ford
That dirty little coward

1310
02:23:26,080 --> 02:23:30,483
I wonder how does he feel

1311
02:23:30,651 --> 02:23:36,385
For he ate at Jesse's bread
And he slept in Jesse's bed

1312
02:23:36,557 --> 02:23:41,585
And he laid poor Jesse in his grave

1313
02:23:42,062 --> 02:23:47,591
Well, Jesse had a wife
To mourn for his life

1314
02:23:47,768 --> 02:23:52,671
Three children
They were brave

1315
02:23:52,840 --> 02:23:58,472
But that dirty little coward
Who shot Mr. Howard

1316
02:23:58,646 --> 02:24:02,810
Has laid poor Jesse in his grave

1317
02:24:14,361 --> 02:24:16,386
I'm Robert Ford.

1318
02:24:27,107 --> 02:24:30,838
It was two children, not three.

1319
02:24:42,222 --> 02:24:43,553
Hey.

1320
02:24:44,458 --> 02:24:47,018
You get yourself home, son, okay?

1321
02:24:47,728 --> 02:24:51,755
Come on. Get out of here.
Get out of my place.

1322
02:25:23,530 --> 02:25:25,725
He thought, at his angriest...

1323
02:25:25,899 --> 02:25:29,665
...about visiting the kin
of Jesse's slaughtered victims:

1324
02:25:31,638 --> 02:25:34,903
Mrs. William Westfall in Plattsburg...

1325
02:25:37,411 --> 02:25:40,505
...the Wymore family in Clay County...

1326
02:25:45,652 --> 02:25:49,952
...perhaps even Mrs. Joseph Heywood
in Northfield, Minnesota.

1327
02:25:53,026 --> 02:25:56,018
He would go to their homes
and give his name as Robert Ford...

1328
02:25:56,196 --> 02:25:59,165
...the man who killed Jesse James.

1329
02:26:00,601 --> 02:26:03,661
He imagined they would
be grateful to him.

1330
02:26:54,621 --> 02:26:59,615
It was only with Dorothy Evans
that Bob spoke revealingly or plainly...

1331
02:26:59,793 --> 02:27:04,230
...and it was with her that he spoke of
things he didn't know he knew.

1332
02:27:25,886 --> 02:27:29,947
He told her that he had no real memory
of the shooting and its aftermath.

1333
02:27:30,123 --> 02:27:33,991
He could remember lifting the gun
that Jesse had given him...

1334
02:27:34,728 --> 02:27:38,755
...and then it was Good Friday and he was
reading about the funeral proceedings...

1335
02:27:38,932 --> 02:27:41,457
...as if they'd happened a long time ago.

1336
02:27:43,036 --> 02:27:45,163
Why did you kill him?

1337
02:27:49,476 --> 02:27:51,501
Well, he was gonna kill me.

1338
02:27:56,717 --> 02:27:59,948
So you were scared
and that's the only reason?

1339
02:28:02,689 --> 02:28:04,088
Yeah.

1340
02:28:04,558 --> 02:28:06,617
And the reward money.

1341
02:28:12,432 --> 02:28:15,230
Do you want me to change the subject?

1342
02:28:23,443 --> 02:28:25,775
You know what I expected?

1343
02:28:26,813 --> 02:28:28,804
Applause.

1344
02:28:31,385 --> 02:28:35,549
I was only 20 years old then.
I couldn't see how it would look to people.

1345
02:28:39,660 --> 02:28:42,322
I was surprised by what happened.

1346
02:28:43,397 --> 02:28:45,365
They didn't applaud.

1347
02:28:48,802 --> 02:28:50,667
He was ashamed of his boasting...

1348
02:28:50,837 --> 02:28:53,704
...his pretensions of courage
and ruthlessness.

1349
02:28:54,007 --> 02:28:57,773
He was sorry about his cold-bloodedness,
his dispassion...

1350
02:28:59,413 --> 02:29:03,816
...his inability to express
what he now believed was the case:

1351
02:29:06,386 --> 02:29:09,412
That he truly regretted killing Jesse...

1352
02:29:10,190 --> 02:29:13,182
...that he missed the man
as much as anybody...

1353
02:29:13,727 --> 02:29:16,855
...and wished his murder
hadn't been necessary.

1354
02:29:36,316 --> 02:29:38,409
Even as he circulated his saloon...

1355
02:29:38,585 --> 02:29:42,351
...he knew that the smiles disappeared
when he passed by.

1356
02:29:43,457 --> 02:29:45,288
He received so many menacing letters...

1357
02:29:45,459 --> 02:29:48,895
...that he could read them
without any reaction except curiosity.

1358
02:29:52,699 --> 02:29:57,500
He kept to his apartment all day,
flipping over playing cards...

1359
02:29:59,006 --> 02:30:03,500
...looking at his destiny
in every king and jack.

1360
02:30:07,714 --> 02:30:12,014
Edward O'Kelly came up from Bachelor
at 1 p.m. On the 8th.

1361
02:30:13,487 --> 02:30:17,423
He had no grand scheme, no strategy...

1362
02:30:17,591 --> 02:30:19,991
...no agreement with higher authorities...

1363
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:22,924
...nothing beyond
a vague longing for glory...

1364
02:30:23,997 --> 02:30:28,263
...and a generalized wish
for revenge against Robert Ford.

1365
02:30:36,043 --> 02:30:39,308
- How'd it go last night?
- Not so bad.

1366
02:30:42,549 --> 02:30:43,948
The other one.

1367
02:30:46,453 --> 02:30:49,217
Edward O'Kelly would be ordered
to serve a life sentence...

1368
02:30:49,389 --> 02:30:52,290
...in the Colorado Penitentiary
for second-degree murder.

1369
02:30:52,459 --> 02:30:55,223
Over 7000 signatures
would eventually be gathered...

1370
02:30:55,395 --> 02:30:57,659
...on a petition asking for
O'Kelly's release...

1371
02:30:57,831 --> 02:31:02,825
...and in 1902, Governor James B. Orman
would pardon the man.

1372
02:31:03,437 --> 02:31:07,840
You shouldn't be wearing that stickpin
again there, Bob. Opals are unlucky.

1373
02:31:09,276 --> 02:31:13,474
My luck's not very good as it is. I don't
think an opal's gonna change that much.

1374
02:31:14,414 --> 02:31:15,847
I hear you.

1375
02:31:29,429 --> 02:31:31,294
There would be no eulogies for Bob...

1376
02:31:32,999 --> 02:31:37,095
...no photographs of his body
would be sold in sundries stores...

1377
02:31:37,804 --> 02:31:42,173
...no people would crowd the streets
in the rain to see his funeral cortege...

1378
02:31:43,910 --> 02:31:46,879
...no biographies would be written
about him...

1379
02:31:47,047 --> 02:31:49,607
...no children named after him.

1380
02:31:51,184 --> 02:31:55,917
No one would ever pay 25 cents
to stand in the rooms he grew up in.

1381
02:32:00,460 --> 02:32:02,189
Hello, Bob.

1382
02:32:03,630 --> 02:32:07,828
The shotgun would ignite,
and Ella Mae would scream...

1383
02:32:08,635 --> 02:32:12,298
...but Robert Ford would only lay
on the floor and look at the ceiling...

1384
02:32:12,472 --> 02:32:14,963
...the light going out of his eyes...

1385
02:32:15,142 --> 02:32:17,872
