1
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,517
<i>He was growing into middle age...</i>

2
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,216
<i>...and was living then in a bungalow
on Woodland Avenue.</i>

3
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:20,323
<i>He installed himself in a rocking chair...</i>

4
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,556
<i>...and smoked a cigar down
in the evenings...</i>

5
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:25,633
<i>...as his wife wiped her pink hands
on an apron...</i>

6
00:01:25,802 --> 00:01:28,999
<i>...and reported happily
on their two children.</i>

7
00:01:34,944 --> 00:01:36,502
<i>His children knew his legs...</i>

8
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:40,010
<i>...the sting of his mustache
against their cheeks.</i>

9
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:46,015
<i>They didn't know how their father made
his living or why they so often moved.</i>

10
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,657
<i>They didn't even know
their father's name.</i>

11
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:55,829
<i>He was listed in the city directory
as Thomas Howard.</i>

12
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:58,431
<i>And he went everywhere unrecognized...</i>

13
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:01,661
<i>...and lunched with Kansas City
shopkeepers and merchants...</i>

14
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,197
<i>...calling himself a cattleman
or a commodities investor...</i>

15
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:09,670
<i>...someone rich and leisured
who had the common touch.</i>

16
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:16,218
<i>He had two incompletely healed
bullet holes in his chest...</i>

17
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,944
<i>...and another in his thigh.</i>

18
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:20,646
<i>He was missing the nub
of his left middle finger...</i>

19
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:24,055
<i>...and was cautious,
lest that mutilation be seen.</i>

20
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,560
<i>He also had a condition that was
referred to as "granulated eyelids"...</i>

21
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,724
<i>...and it caused him
to blink more than usual...</i>

22
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:37,633
<i>...as if he found creation
slightly more than he could accept.</i>

23
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,836
<i>Rooms seemed hotter
when he was in them.</i>

24
00:02:42,312 --> 00:02:44,041
<i>Rains fell straighter.</i>

25
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:45,978
<i>Clocks slowed.</i>

26
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:48,913
<i>Sounds were amplified.</i>

27
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:52,817
<i>He considered himself
a Southern loyalist and guerrilla...</i>

28
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:55,958
<i>...in a Civil War that never ended.</i>

29
00:02:56,125 --> 00:03:01,495
<i>He regretted neither his robberies,
nor the 17 murders that he laid claim to.</i>

30
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:12,235
<i>He had seen another summer under
in Kansas City, Missouri...</i>

31
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:16,708
<i>...and on September 5th
in the year 1881...</i>

32
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:20,509
<i>...he was 34 years old.</i>

33
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:31,225
You just... You just slide them things
right in there, right in your sleeve...

34
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:34,420
...and then, when you get ready,
you just shake it out.

35
00:03:34,597 --> 00:03:36,929
Like that, right there. You shake it out.

36
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:44,466
Mary Todd Lincoln, tyrant's wife, fall
into hysterics when the moon was full.

37
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,201
President's men would tie her up
with hay-baling wire...

38
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:49,572
...keep her from ripping
her husband's ears off.

39
00:03:49,746 --> 00:03:54,240
You never heard word one about the wife of
the Confederacy's Jefferson Davis, did you?

40
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:55,714
- I didn't.
- No, you didn't.

41
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,818
He did his duty by her.

42
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:03,715
- Oh, my God, I'm speaking to children.
- No, I get it, I get it, I get it.

43
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:08,091
The president of the Confederacy discerned
his wife's needs and satisfied them...

44
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:12,892
...with the utmost skill
and the utmost courtesy.

45
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:18,162
- Charley, you spit all over my boot.
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry, Jesse.

46
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:21,299
- Here, get it off.
- I'll wipe it... I'll wipe it off.

47
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:25,840
But Abraham Lincoln probably sent his wife
on a shopping expedition.

48
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,781
- A three-act play.
- With money stole from us.

49
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,787
Chow!

50
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:38,617
I think insanity run on both sides
of that Lincoln family.

51
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:40,695
You're right about that.

52
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,457
The river... You jump in the river.

53
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:48,995
- Chow!
- Don't be shy now, Dick.

54
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:51,604
- One more piece of meat.
- When you diddle a lot...

55
00:04:51,774 --> 00:04:54,265
There's a good piece of bacon fat
in there for him.

56
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:31,237
Excuse me.

57
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:35,376
I see I've traipsed right on in
and interrupted you.

58
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,415
Who are you, then?

59
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:41,921
Bob Ford.

60
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:44,554
Charley's brother?

61
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:47,428
Yeah.

62
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:04,774
I was lying when I said
I just happened down here.

63
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:09,213
I've been looking for you. I feel lousy
I didn't say so at the outset.

64
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,380
Folks take me for a nincompoop...

65
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:17,287
...on account of the shabby first impression
I make, whereas I think of myself...

66
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,894
...as being just a rung down
from the James brothers.

67
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,732
I was hoping if I ran into you
aside from those peckerwoods...

68
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,961
...I could show you how special I am.

69
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:43,408
I honestly believe I'm destined
for great things, Mr. James.

70
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:47,920
I got qualities that don't come shining
through right at the outset.

71
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:53,756
You give me a chance, I'll get
the job done. I guarantee you that.

72
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,265
Hey, Dick, is it true you diddled a squaw?

73
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:07,738
Come on, you can tell me. I've always
wanted to lay down with a redskin.

74
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:09,744
Well, Charley...

75
00:07:11,214 --> 00:07:14,650
...there's a feeling that comes over you...

76
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:18,480
...getting inside a woman whose hands
has scalped a congregation.

77
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:21,487
There's this thunderous sound
that comes from their cooch...

78
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:24,922
...on account of the fact that
they birth a child standing upright...

79
00:07:25,094 --> 00:07:28,086
...like a wild animal.
- What's it sound like?

80
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:32,530
Whatever a thunderous cooch sounds like
there, Charley. I don't know.

81
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:34,535
No.

82
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,104
They got a noisy quim
on account of the fact that...

83
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:42,176
...they use their cunnis as a saddlebag
to carry sundries across the plains.

84
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,242
Come on, what'd it really feel like?
Did it feel good?

85
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:48,815
Come on, fess up, now.

86
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:50,885
I like you, Charley.

87
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:54,483
I like you too, Charley.

88
00:07:54,924 --> 00:07:55,948
Well...

89
00:07:57,994 --> 00:07:59,985
You're not so special, Mr. Ford.

90
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:04,865
You're just like any other tyro
who's prinked himself up for an escapade.

91
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:08,868
Hoping to be a gunslinger
like them nickel books are about.

92
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:12,739
You may as well quench your mind of it...

93
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:17,002
...because you don't have
the ingredients, son.

94
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:34,560
Well, I'm sorry to hear
you feel that way...

95
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,927
...as I put such stock
in your opinions.

96
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:47,201
As for me being a gunslinger, I've just got
this one granddaddy Paterson Colt...

97
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:49,844
...and a borrowed belt to stick it in.

98
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:53,345
But I also got an appetite
for greater things.

99
00:08:56,586 --> 00:09:00,613
I hoped by joining up with you, it'd put me
that much closer to getting them.

100
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:06,187
Well, what am I supposed to say to that?

101
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:10,259
Let me be your sidekick tonight.

102
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:11,559
Sidekick?

103
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:13,861
So you can examine my grit
and intelligence.

104
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:15,731
I don't know what it is about you...

105
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:18,965
...but the more you talk,
the more you give me the willies.

106
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:23,037
Now, I don't believe I want you anywhere
within earshot this evening, okay?

107
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:24,702
You understand?

108
00:09:28,884 --> 00:09:32,251
- Well, I'm sorry...
- Why don't you just get now? Scat.

109
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:39,519
All right.

110
00:09:42,265 --> 00:09:45,826
I was with a girl once, wasn't a squaw.

111
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,867
But she was pretty.

112
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:52,606
She had yellow hair like a...

113
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,175
Oh, like something.

114
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:59,312
Like hair bobbed from a ray of sunlight?

115
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:02,417
Yeah. Yeah, like that.

116
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:05,781
Boy, you... You talk good.

117
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:08,617
You can hide things in vocabulary.

118
00:10:10,593 --> 00:10:15,155
Maybe you and me could write her a note,
send it by post?

119
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:17,026
See, all you gotta do, Ed...

120
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,498
...is predict her needs
and beat her to the punch.

121
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:26,437
Well, this girl, she has a real specific job.

122
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,534
- Specific?
- We was only together once.

123
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,974
She...

124
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:36,209
She was afraid of lightning,
and she came up under the wagon and...

125
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:39,320
...just cuddled right up to me.

126
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:41,456
She give me a kind price too.

127
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:47,519
Well, I'll be. That is specific.

128
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,530
Yeah, sure,
she'd been with other people...

129
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:54,761
...but the kind of things she said to me...

130
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:58,065
...people just don't say
unless they really mean it.

131
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:01,306
<i>My love said she would marry only me</i>

132
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:05,204
<i>And Jove himself could not make her care.</i>

133
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:07,975
<i>For what women say to lovers, you'll agree</i>

134
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,246
<i>One writes on running water or on air.</i>

135
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:17,318
My God, that's good.
Let's write her that.

136
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:19,954
No.

137
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,662
Poetry don't work on whores.

138
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,826
How do you do?

139
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:32,332
Am I too late
to wish you a happy birthday?

140
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,172
How'd you know?

141
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:39,010
You'd be surprised
at what I got stored away.

142
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:41,775
I'm an authority on the James boys.

143
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,418
Is you?

144
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:49,649
Well... Well, your brother Frank and I,
we just had a real nice visit.

145
00:11:49,825 --> 00:11:53,989
Just chit-chatting about this and that,
right over there.

146
00:11:54,397 --> 00:11:57,298
And must've been a hundred subjects
entertained...

147
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,832
Good Lord, you know
what this stew needs?

148
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:06,134
Dumplings?

149
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,071
Noodles.

150
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:11,811
You eat yourself some noodle stew
and your clock'll tick all night.

151
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,849
You ever see that woman up in Fayette?
Suck noodles up her nose.

152
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,415
- In Fayette?
- I don't believe I have.

153
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:21,920
You never heard of her, huh?

154
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:25,421
You got canals up there
you never dreamed of.

155
00:12:29,598 --> 00:12:31,293
I don't like to harp on a subject...

156
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:34,061
I don't care who comes with me.
Never have.

157
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:36,830
That's why they call me gregarious.

158
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:41,472
I hear you and young Stovepipe here
had a real nice visit.

159
00:12:41,944 --> 00:12:45,971
Your boys have got about a acre
of lumber to haul, dingus.

160
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,646
You better goose them down yonder.

161
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:03,093
<i>The James Gang committed over 25 bank,
train and stagecoach robberies...</i>

162
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:06,701
<i>...from 1867 to 1881.</i>

163
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:09,662
<i>But except for Frank and Jesse James...</i>

164
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,969
<i>...all the original members
were now either dead or in prison.</i>

165
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:18,974
<i>- mine eye
All my soul and all my every part</i>

166
00:13:19,849 --> 00:13:22,647
<i>And for this sin, there is no remedy</i>

167
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,149
<i>It is so grounded inward in my heart.</i>

168
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:28,620
<i>So for their last robbery at Blue Cut...</i>

169
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:32,386
<i>...the brothers recruited a gang
of petty thieves and country rubes...</i>

170
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,223
<i>...culled from the local hillsides.</i>

171
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,270
Right on schedule, Buck!

172
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:58,004
Snuff those lanterns!

173
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,980
Look at those fools. They're gonna trip
and shoot each other into females.

174
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,279
I bet you I could find them husbands
if they do.

175
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:51,883
Fan out!

176
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:57,331
Hold your fire!

177
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:01,530
- Watch him!
- Going down.

178
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,275
Hold your fire, you idiots!

179
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,513
Hold your fire!

180
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,361
Let me in.

181
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:34,933
Buck! Boys!

182
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:37,163
Buck, this way!

183
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,474
Do you think that lock will hold?

184
00:17:42,044 --> 00:17:43,705
No, I don't.

185
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,138
Let's go, let's go.

186
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,761
Let's not get clever, nor courageous,
any of you.

187
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,340
Hey there, boys!
These are all for me?

188
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,616
Looks like Christmas morning in here.

189
00:18:24,453 --> 00:18:26,045
Hey, friend.

190
00:18:27,556 --> 00:18:29,547
You mind if I have a peek around?

191
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,188
This shit. Nope.

192
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:35,293
Nope.

193
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:38,296
You got anything good here?

194
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:40,601
It could be.

195
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,318
Open that safe.

196
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:04,216
Do it!

197
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,823
- You didn't have to bop him.
- Yeah, he did. They needed convincing.

198
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:13,433
They got their company rules,
I got my mean streak...

199
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:16,093
...and that's how
we get things done around here.

200
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:20,903
- Get on over here and attend to this thing.
- Come on, go.

201
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:27,914
Hold your fire, you idiots!

202
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,181
Dig deeper.

203
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,083
- Come on!
- Give me your money.

204
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,192
- And you, stand up.
- Let's see your hands.

205
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,089
What have you got?

206
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,594
Speak English.

207
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,301
Money. Money. You understand that?

208
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:51,339
Give me your money!

209
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,716
There's some receipts.

210
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:06,319
I got fives.

211
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:10,324
Jesse. Jesse.

212
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,626
Don't look good.

213
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:24,235
There ain't no 100,000 dollars
in here, Dick.

214
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:34,673
Get down on your knees.

215
00:20:35,884 --> 00:20:37,408
Why?

216
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:39,144
Well, you ought to pray.

217
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,513
I'm gonna kill you.

218
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:49,959
Get at!

219
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:54,599
You're gonna have to make me.

220
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,500
All right.

221
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:29,197
Don't shoot him! No, don't shoot him.

222
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:44,113
Don't tell me what I can
and cannot do, Ed.

223
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,924
Round them up!

224
00:22:13,015 --> 00:22:16,815
<i>Chicago newspaper publishers made
a great deal of the Blue Cut train robbery...</i>

225
00:22:16,985 --> 00:22:18,976
<i>...alleging that in no state
but Missouri...</i>

226
00:22:19,154 --> 00:22:22,646
<i>...would the James brothers be tolerated
for 12 years.</i>

227
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,657
Hey.

228
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,426
Can you keep a secret?

229
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:32,192
It depends on what you're concealing.

230
00:22:33,535 --> 00:22:35,696
You afraid of the dark?

231
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:38,095
No.

232
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,667
You superstitious?

233
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:48,074
I put... I put an acorn in the window
to keep the lightning out.

234
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:41,229
Kid, you must've crept up on cat's paws.

235
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,606
I'll wager that's the first and last time
you'll ever be caught off-guard.

236
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:49,901
How old are you?

237
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,779
Twenty.

238
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:59,147
Except, well, I guess I won't
really be 20 till...

239
00:23:59,654 --> 00:24:01,815
Till January, so...

240
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:04,522
I'm 19.

241
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:10,091
Yeah, you feel older than that, though,
don't you?

242
00:24:14,803 --> 00:24:16,668
Yeah, I do.

243
00:24:29,651 --> 00:24:33,951
Hey, Frank, you...
You think the sheriff's out already?

244
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,720
- More than likely.
- Yeah.

245
00:24:41,663 --> 00:24:43,460
I had a real fine time tonight.

246
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:46,863
- You think so?
- Yup. Yeah.

247
00:24:47,035 --> 00:24:50,198
Hey, I wasn't just flapping my lips
about my kid brother and me.

248
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:55,134
What I figured was if you and Jesse could
gauge our courage and our daring...

249
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,574
...you might just make us
your regular sidekicks.

250
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,976
Your courage and your daring.

251
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:06,312
I about heard all I want to about sidekicks.
You sound like your damn brother.

252
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:10,982
Yeah. Well, I'll be square with you,
it's Bob who put me up to it. He's...

253
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,859
He's got plans for the James boys
I can't even get the hang of.

254
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,827
- They're that complicated.
- Yeah?

255
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:20,561
Well, you can just
get shed of that idea.

256
00:25:20,735 --> 00:25:23,260
Because after tonight,
there'll be no more shenanigans.

257
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,772
You can jot that down in your little diary.

258
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:31,709
September 7th, 1881, the James Gang
robbed one last train at Blue Cut...

259
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,371
...and gave up their nightriding for good.

260
00:25:41,022 --> 00:25:42,512
Wait.

261
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,650
Well, how are you gonna
make your living?

262
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,000
Maybe I'll sell shoes.

263
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,905
I can't believe I woke up this morning...

264
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:09,380
...wondering if my daddy
would loan me his overcoat...

265
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:11,416
...and here it is just past midnight...

266
00:26:11,586 --> 00:26:15,147
...I've already robbed a railroad train
and I'm sitting in a rocking chair...

267
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,553
...chatting with none other
than Jesse James.

268
00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:20,921
Yeah, it's a wonderful world.

269
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,168
What's this?

270
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:33,068
Oh, yeah.

271
00:26:34,242 --> 00:26:38,303
I was real agitated this morning, so I was
wondering if I would know you or Frank...

272
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,611
...tell you all apart, and so I had
this clipping that described you both.

273
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,848
Want me to read it?

274
00:26:46,454 --> 00:26:47,614
Go on.

275
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:51,885
Well... I gotta find it. Hold on.

276
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:55,024
Here. Here.

277
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:59,326
"Jesse James, the youngest, has a face
as smooth and innocent as a schoolgirl.

278
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:03,870
The blue eyes, very clear and penetrating,
are never at rest.

279
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,531
His form is tall and graceful
and capable of great endurance...

280
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,142
...and great effort.

281
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:13,304
Jesse is lighthearted, reckless,
and devil-may-care.

282
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:17,716
- There's always a smile on his lips..."
- All right, all right, all right.

283
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,686
Well, yeah, then it just... Frank, Frank,
Frank. That's nothing. And then...

284
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:36,000
You know what I got
right next to my bed?

285
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:41,701
<i>Is The Train Robbers, or, A Story
of the James Boys by R.W. Stevens.</i>

286
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:44,811
I mean, many's the night I stayed up...

287
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,407
...with my eyes open
and my mouth open...

288
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,745
...just reading about your escapades
in the Wide Awake Library.

289
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:54,582
They're all lies, you know.

290
00:27:57,992 --> 00:27:59,960
Yeah, of course they are.

291
00:28:03,231 --> 00:28:06,428
You don't have to keep smoking that
if it's making you bungey.

292
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:32,692
<i>Alexander Franklin James
would be in Baltimore...</i>

293
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:36,524
<i>...when he would read of
the assassination of Jesse James.</i>

294
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:54,574
<i>He had spurned his younger brother
for being peculiar and temperamental.</i>

295
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,215
<i>But once he perceived
that he would never see Jesse again...</i>

296
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:04,451
<i>...Frank would be wrought-up,
perplexed, despondent.</i>

297
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:46,429
My brother and me are hardly
on speaking terms these days.

298
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:50,100
Well, I wasn't gonna mention it.

299
00:30:00,648 --> 00:30:02,081
Are you scared?

300
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,011
No, I'm just surprised a little.

301
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:07,746
They ain't as succulent as I like,
the devil to clean...

302
00:30:07,922 --> 00:30:10,982
...but if a man skins them
and fries them in garlic and oil...

303
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:14,026
...mercy, them's good eating.

304
00:30:14,195 --> 00:30:17,528
Well, I never been that hungry.

305
00:30:20,268 --> 00:30:22,361
I give them names.

306
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:25,204
Such as?

307
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,400
Such as enemies.

308
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:34,143
I give them names of enemies.

309
00:30:46,895 --> 00:30:49,955
Go tell Wood and Charley
to get their gatherings together.

310
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:52,957
All right.

311
00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:55,927
Me too?

312
00:30:58,072 --> 00:31:00,040
You can stay.

313
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:04,035
All right.

314
00:31:10,652 --> 00:31:11,949
Hey.

315
00:31:14,188 --> 00:31:16,884
- What do you want, peckerwood?
- Nothing.

316
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:19,686
Except to say Jesse wants
you two to gather your parts...

317
00:31:19,861 --> 00:31:22,386
...get on your horses
and get out of town.

318
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:24,688
And me to stick around.

319
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:30,129
Well, whoa, I'm his cousin...

320
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,034
...I'll have you know.

321
00:31:32,206 --> 00:31:34,367
My mama's his daddy's sister.

322
00:31:34,742 --> 00:31:36,972
Is that how they described it to you,
Wood?

323
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,773
You better watch your tongue,
young sapling.

324
00:31:40,949 --> 00:31:44,316
Why is it me who's gotta rattle his hocks
out of town and not you, Bunny?

325
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,214
Put your horns away.
If I know Jess...

326
00:31:46,387 --> 00:31:49,618
...there's some real nasty
sad-suzie work's gotta be done...

327
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:52,891
...and Bob's the ninny that has to do it.

328
00:31:53,061 --> 00:31:55,325
Oh, yeah, I'm sure that's it, Charley.

329
00:31:57,065 --> 00:32:01,764
You only met him 12 hours ago.
He doesn't even know your name.

330
00:32:02,804 --> 00:32:06,262
Wood! You tell your daddy
I'll be in Kentucky in October.

331
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,041
We can hunt some birds together.

332
00:32:10,578 --> 00:32:12,011
All right.

333
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,272
So how come it's Bob who gets to stay?

334
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,845
Bob's gonna move my gear to a house
down the street.

335
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:23,914
See?

336
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:27,217
- I don't mind.
- Yeah, well.

337
00:32:27,395 --> 00:32:29,488
Sounds like an adventure.

338
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:37,199
<i>They moved to 1017 Troost Avenue
at night...</i>

339
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:41,809
<i>...so that the neighborhood couldn't get
a good look at them or their belongings.</i>

340
00:32:43,511 --> 00:32:46,207
<i>Then Bob thought Jesse
would give him eight hours' sleep...</i>

341
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,747
<i>...and a daydreaming goodbye.</i>

342
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,779
<i>But with a second day
in the Thomas Howard house...</i>

343
00:32:54,956 --> 00:32:56,947
<i>...Bob thought he might never go...</i>

344
00:32:57,825 --> 00:33:01,625
<i>...but might be brought in
as a good-natured cousin to the boy...</i>

345
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,828
<i>...and a gentleman helper to Zee.</i>

346
00:33:08,836 --> 00:33:10,599
<i>He went everywhere with Jesse.</i>

347
00:33:10,772 --> 00:33:13,036
<i>They made trips
to the Topeka Exchange Saloon...</i>

348
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:17,007
<i>...where Jesse could spend nearly
60 minutes sipping one glass of beer...</i>

349
00:33:17,178 --> 00:33:20,409
<i>...and still complain about feeling tipsy.</i>

350
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,074
<i>Bob would rarely vouchsafe his opinions
as they talked.</i>

351
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,779
<i>If spoken to, he would fidget and grin.</i>

352
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:32,584
<i>If Jesse palavered with another person,
Bob secretaried their dialogue...</i>

353
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,526
<i>...getting each inflection,
reading every gesture and tic...</i>

354
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:39,895
<i>...as if he wanted to compose
a biography of the outlaw...</i>

355
00:33:40,068 --> 00:33:43,003
<i>...or as if he were preparing
an impersonation.</i>

356
00:33:58,853 --> 00:34:00,787
Go away.

357
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:07,355
Used to be couldn't no one sneak up
on Jesse James.

358
00:34:08,696 --> 00:34:11,062
Now you think otherwise?

359
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,330
I ain't never seen you without your guns,
neither.

360
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:30,915
I can't figure it out.

361
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,980
Do you wanna be like me...

362
00:34:34,422 --> 00:34:35,912
...or do you wanna be me?

363
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,093
I'm just making fun, is all.

364
00:34:46,734 --> 00:34:49,999
<i>Bob was sent away cordially
the next day...</i>

365
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,661
<i>...with a goodbye from Jesse...</i>

366
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,775
<i>...but nothing from Zee
beyond what good manners demanded.</i>

367
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,180
<i>It was 40 miles to his sister's farm
from Kansas City.</i>

368
00:35:03,484 --> 00:35:07,784
<i>And it was well into the afternoon
by the time he arrived there.</i>

369
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:12,817
<i>Mrs. Martha Bolton rented
the Harbison farm in 1879...</i>

370
00:35:12,994 --> 00:35:15,554
<i>...just after becoming a widow.</i>

371
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,760
<i>And she made a good income
by giving rooms and meals...</i>

372
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:24,098
<i>...to her brothers Charley, Wilbur and Bob,
and to members of the James Gang...</i>

373
00:35:24,272 --> 00:35:26,763
<i>...who would appear
whenever they needed seclusion.</i>

374
00:35:26,941 --> 00:35:28,636
Dick! You're gonna make her sick!

375
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,779
She's gonna upchuck
if you don't watch out!

376
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:35,543
<i>Wood Hite had been spurned by Martha
in his affections...</i>

377
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,412
<i>...and his attempt to switch his pursuit
to her daughter...</i>

378
00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:40,486
<i>...was being thwarted by Dick Liddil.</i>

379
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:43,954
Wait a second, you assured me
that you were not ticklish.

380
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,149
Howdy!

381
00:35:45,326 --> 00:35:47,157
What's going on, now?
What's going on...?

382
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:50,161
- Howdy!
- Were you fibbing about that?

383
00:35:50,331 --> 00:35:52,128
- No.
- Not at all.

384
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:55,363
You're not supposed to peek, Dick.

385
00:35:55,536 --> 00:35:57,970
Well, you're just so pretty
I can't help myself.

386
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:00,630
- You need to be warning him about that.
- Howdy.

387
00:36:00,808 --> 00:36:04,744
Worry about the field instead,
might be able to worry about the work...

388
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,777
Howdy!

389
00:36:07,548 --> 00:36:10,517
- Finally home.
- I'm so glad, Bob.

390
00:36:10,685 --> 00:36:13,347
I'm in that room too, Bob.
Don't mess with my things.

391
00:36:13,521 --> 00:36:15,546
All right, Grandpa.

392
00:36:21,362 --> 00:36:26,959
"July 9th. Diligence, tact,
and a keen sense of responsibility...

393
00:36:27,134 --> 00:36:31,537
...capacity for detail are your dominant
traits. Your sense of duty's strong."

394
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,477
How long you been there?

395
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,553
Just now arrived. Did I miss much?

396
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,726
Not unless you never seen a man
wash his dirty carcass before.

397
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:29,394
Boy, you got a big old pecker
for being such a little squirrel.

398
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:31,554
That what you come here to see, Dick?

399
00:37:33,467 --> 00:37:34,934
No.

400
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:39,304
Your brother said that Jesse
kept you in Kansas City some extra days.

401
00:37:39,473 --> 00:37:40,531
What was the reason?

402
00:37:42,743 --> 00:37:46,645
Well, I'm not at liberty to say exactly.

403
00:37:47,048 --> 00:37:52,577
Let me ask you this. Did Jesse mention
that me and Cummins were in cahoots?

404
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:54,914
Is that so?

405
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:59,025
Oh, dear. I went on and said too much,
have I?

406
00:37:59,393 --> 00:38:01,452
Well, who else is partners with you two?

407
00:38:03,831 --> 00:38:08,325
See, he'll cut our throats if he finds out.
You don't know him like I do.

408
00:38:08,502 --> 00:38:12,495
You do Jesse dirt,
you connive behind his back...

409
00:38:12,673 --> 00:38:15,471
...boy, he'll come after you
with a cleaver.

410
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:20,670
So, what are you two cahoots
cooking up?

411
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:25,311
Don't know that I should say.

412
00:38:26,487 --> 00:38:28,580
I'm not gonna wheedle
the dang news from you.

413
00:38:28,756 --> 00:38:30,519
How about we'll leave it a mystery...

414
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:34,989
...and then we won't neither one of us
regret our little chat?

415
00:38:40,701 --> 00:38:43,465
Can you hand me that six-gun there, Bob?

416
00:38:52,546 --> 00:38:56,676
If you so much as mention my name
to Jesse...

417
00:38:56,851 --> 00:38:59,183
...boy, I'll find out about it.

418
00:38:59,353 --> 00:39:02,345
You had better believe that.

419
00:39:02,523 --> 00:39:04,548
And I'll look you up.

420
00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:09,628
I'll knock on your door,
and I will be as mad as a hornet.

421
00:39:10,364 --> 00:39:12,525
I will be hot.

422
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:17,199
You be careful with that iron, Dick.

423
00:39:25,513 --> 00:39:29,108
You know where I stand on these matters
and that's all there is to it.

424
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,878
Me and you can be as friendly as pigs
from now on.

425
00:39:58,379 --> 00:40:01,837
I'm Bunny Ford, stick your hands
up in the air!

426
00:40:02,016 --> 00:40:03,711
Mister.

427
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,219
Oh, you have some nerve.

428
00:40:12,526 --> 00:40:17,930
We were just reading about the James boys
among the Mexicans.

429
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,329
What's this? This ain't Jesse.

430
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,631
- You don't know that.
- He would've never wore no mustache.

431
00:40:25,806 --> 00:40:28,172
Never was anywheres near a cannon.

432
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,776
Let me see that picture.

433
00:40:30,945 --> 00:40:33,675
Boy, I can't even calculate
what I'm looking at.

434
00:40:33,914 --> 00:40:36,041
- Give me that.
- Ever since he was a child...

435
00:40:36,217 --> 00:40:39,414
...Bob's collected whatsoever he could find
about the James brothers.

436
00:40:39,587 --> 00:40:41,782
Yeah, got himself a little museum
in his room.

437
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:45,551
Next time you come snooping around,
you better strap on a shooting iron!

438
00:40:46,093 --> 00:40:48,584
Well, you can see how scared I am.

439
00:40:48,762 --> 00:40:52,630
You too, Wood Hite. Cross me again,
I'll put a bullet through your head!

440
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:54,828
Boy, you...

441
00:40:55,503 --> 00:40:58,165
Son, you better recollect
who my cousin is...

442
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:02,400
...because you've seemed to misremembered
that Jesse loves me like the Good Book.

443
00:41:02,576 --> 00:41:06,205
Now, you may play it like you're
a dangerous person in the grocery store...

444
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,780
...but don't misremember
who you be accounting to...

445
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:11,383
...if I so much get my feelings hurt.
- I don't care!

446
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,110
Do I have to yell "suwee"?

447
00:41:13,287 --> 00:41:15,255
Why don't we make up,
be pleasant for once?

448
00:41:15,422 --> 00:41:18,255
Why don't we pass the evening
like pleasant human beings?

449
00:41:18,425 --> 00:41:20,689
I like your nickel suit, cowboy.

450
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,283
You see something?

451
00:41:49,523 --> 00:41:51,320
Just a bird.

452
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,995
<i>The month of October came...</i>

453
00:41:57,164 --> 00:42:00,600
<i>...and Jesse began seeing
Pinkerton operatives in every floor walker...</i>

454
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:05,171
<i>...street sweeper, and common man
poking about in a store.</i>

455
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,966
<i>On the morning of the 11 th,
he would wake his wife...</i>

456
00:42:10,144 --> 00:42:14,342
<i>...with the Scripture pertaining to
the Holy Family's flight into Egypt.</i>

457
00:42:18,085 --> 00:42:22,988
<i>Overnight, the Thomas Howard clan
vanished from Kansas City.</i>

458
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:36,129
<i>Shortly thereafter,
four of the Blue Cut train robbers...</i>

459
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:39,136
<i>...were arrested in shacks near Glendale.</i>

460
00:42:44,178 --> 00:42:47,875
<i>How Jesse could have known
remains a mystery.</i>

461
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:02,919
<i>Theirs was a wandering existence.</i>

462
00:43:03,097 --> 00:43:04,792
<i>Men who choose to be outlaws...</i>

463
00:43:04,965 --> 00:43:08,901
<i>...cannot afford to remain in one place
for very long.</i>

464
00:43:17,945 --> 00:43:22,211
- Well, goodness. Maybe I'll change my mind.
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

465
00:43:22,383 --> 00:43:24,613
- Martha.
- Buck up, man.

466
00:43:24,785 --> 00:43:28,346
<i>Wood and Dick would bicker
across the entire state of Kentucky...</i>

467
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:33,482
<i>...until they made Russellville, home
of Major George Hite, Wood's father...</i>

468
00:43:33,661 --> 00:43:36,789
<i>...and uncle to Frank and Jesse James.</i>

469
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,033
You stay away from this one.

470
00:43:47,808 --> 00:43:49,833
She's my daddy's wife.

471
00:43:50,778 --> 00:43:52,109
You got it?

472
00:44:16,036 --> 00:44:17,663
Did you cook this, ma'am?

473
00:44:20,974 --> 00:44:23,238
I've got a nigger woman.

474
00:44:25,346 --> 00:44:26,370
How's that?

475
00:44:30,818 --> 00:44:34,185
Dick asked if I cooked this.

476
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:35,911
Did you?

477
00:44:38,492 --> 00:44:39,516
No.

478
00:44:48,736 --> 00:44:51,170
She knew what he was like
when she married him.

479
00:45:17,698 --> 00:45:21,930
I guess we're the night owls, you and I.

480
00:45:23,337 --> 00:45:25,168
I'm glad.

481
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:28,907
How come?

482
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:32,504
You're interesting to look at.

483
00:45:33,414 --> 00:45:36,906
You have a real pleasant disposition.

484
00:45:38,552 --> 00:45:42,488
And I don't know, you sort of
make me feel warm all over.

485
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:49,155
You know, I'm what they call a...
An inamorato.

486
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:57,732
Well, I knew
there had to be a name for it.

487
00:46:01,575 --> 00:46:03,736
You and the Hites
don't get along too well...

488
00:46:03,911 --> 00:46:07,176
...if I'm to trust Wood and his version
of the situation.

489
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:11,875
We hate each other like poison,
if you wanna know the truth.

490
00:46:12,553 --> 00:46:16,250
Most of the Hites wouldn't spit on me
if I was on fire.

491
00:46:18,492 --> 00:46:21,290
They say that when a woman's on fire...

492
00:46:21,462 --> 00:46:25,899
...you're supposed to roll her around on
the ground and cover her with your body.

493
00:46:27,234 --> 00:46:29,964
Well, you are a naughty tease.

494
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,842
Isn't it about bedtime?

495
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,047
Well, I'll just kiss those dainty nubbins.

496
00:46:56,997 --> 00:46:58,396
Good night.

497
00:47:12,846 --> 00:47:13,938
Would you stop?

498
00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:23,246
Boy, I believe I drank too much coffee.

499
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,293
I gotta go visit the privy
something terrible.

500
00:47:59,593 --> 00:48:01,891
This is embarrassing.

501
00:48:02,563 --> 00:48:06,624
Now, you go ahead and do your duty.
I don't mind.

502
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:11,862
I've sort of got stage fright with
a strange man in the commode with me.

503
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:13,563
I ain't strange.

504
00:48:13,874 --> 00:48:16,775
I'm built just like the rest of them.

505
00:48:19,513 --> 00:48:22,607
You look awful pretty.

506
00:48:24,017 --> 00:48:25,780
Do I?

507
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:30,817
I haven't never in my life seen
such well-shaped limbs.

508
00:48:38,398 --> 00:48:40,525
Is Wood awake?

509
00:48:42,769 --> 00:48:44,031
It's just me.

510
00:48:52,879 --> 00:48:55,814
And I bet you thought I was a lady.

511
00:49:42,629 --> 00:49:44,961
Well, you ain't much of a housekeeper,
are you?

512
00:49:48,301 --> 00:49:49,996
You didn't just happen by.

513
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,101
Why not?

514
00:50:21,368 --> 00:50:24,269
Go on and take a load off your feet.

515
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,355
You ought to get yourself a wife.

516
00:50:51,732 --> 00:50:53,097
Yeah.

517
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:55,164
I suppose.

518
00:50:58,538 --> 00:51:01,769
I was gonna ask Martha. Charley's sister.

519
00:51:01,942 --> 00:51:05,309
I was gonna ask her
if she could imagine it.

520
00:51:06,546 --> 00:51:09,413
But I guess Wood has plans of his own.

521
00:51:10,016 --> 00:51:12,644
And there's always Dick Liddil
getting in the way.

522
00:51:13,754 --> 00:51:15,722
I'll give it some thought, though.

523
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,458
Your crops come in?

524
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:24,756
No, I don't got much.
Just a garden patch and a pasture.

525
00:51:27,033 --> 00:51:29,399
I was sick at planting time.

526
00:51:30,403 --> 00:51:31,802
So...

527
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,339
Ed, how you feeling now?

528
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,237
Why?

529
00:51:42,149 --> 00:51:44,344
You're acting queer.

530
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:56,522
Well, you and me ain't been
just real good friends lately.

531
00:51:57,497 --> 00:52:00,591
That's not your fault,
you understand that.

532
00:52:02,936 --> 00:52:04,563
You hear talk, though.

533
00:52:06,606 --> 00:52:08,096
Talk?

534
00:52:11,912 --> 00:52:14,142
People tell you things.

535
00:52:21,688 --> 00:52:23,781
Why don't you give me an example?

536
00:52:28,094 --> 00:52:30,221
Jim Cummins come by here.

537
00:52:31,865 --> 00:52:33,196
Jim Cummins.

538
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,699
Oh, and Jim says:

539
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,936
"You know them boys
that got caught in the Blue Cut deal?"

540
00:52:46,012 --> 00:52:49,641
Well, Jim says he got word...

541
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:56,380
...that you're planning to kill them.

542
00:52:58,225 --> 00:53:00,489
Why would I do that?

543
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,556
That's just talk probably.

544
00:53:08,568 --> 00:53:12,402
Jim Cummins. He say anything else?

545
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:16,640
Nope. No, that was it, basically.

546
00:53:27,053 --> 00:53:29,453
That still don't explain why you're scared.

547
00:53:33,093 --> 00:53:35,960
Well, I'm in the same situation, you see.

548
00:53:36,696 --> 00:53:38,721
I was terrified I saw you ride up.

549
00:53:39,366 --> 00:53:42,358
- I just happened by, Ed.
- Suppose you heard gossip, though.

550
00:53:42,535 --> 00:53:45,470
Suppose you heard Jim Cummins
come by, you might have thought...

551
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:50,599
...that we were planning to capture you
or get that reward, and that ain't true.

552
00:53:50,777 --> 00:53:53,075
But you might have suspected it.

553
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:14,025
Haven't heard a lick of gossip lately.

554
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:18,637
I got 600 dollars stashed away.
I don't need no governor's reward.

555
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:23,475
Well, it's the principle too.

556
00:54:28,481 --> 00:54:29,971
Well...

557
00:54:30,283 --> 00:54:33,775
- I'm glad I stopped by.
- Oh, me too.

558
00:54:58,578 --> 00:55:01,638
What do you say
if we were to go for a ride?

559
00:55:06,586 --> 00:55:09,453
We can go into town. I'll buy you dinner.

560
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,355
Then I'll be on my way.

561
00:55:22,335 --> 00:55:24,064
Okay.

562
00:56:24,497 --> 00:56:26,226
You ready to go for a ride?

563
00:56:42,015 --> 00:56:44,381
We going to your place?

564
00:56:49,222 --> 00:56:51,349
You seen Ed Miller lately?

565
00:56:52,725 --> 00:56:54,852
Nobody has.

566
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,259
Must have gone off to California.

567
00:57:05,305 --> 00:57:07,637
I'd still like to know where we're going.

568
00:57:12,812 --> 00:57:16,714
If you were going to see Jim Cummins,
wouldn't you follow this road?

569
00:57:22,155 --> 00:57:23,986
I guess so.

570
00:58:06,933 --> 00:58:08,400
Howdy.

571
00:58:19,279 --> 00:58:21,406
Oh, are you friends of my pa's?

572
00:58:26,486 --> 00:58:28,317
We're friends of Jim Cummins.

573
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:35,359
Well, it so happens
he's been gone since August.

574
00:58:35,528 --> 00:58:37,587
And never said where he gone to.

575
00:58:42,502 --> 00:58:45,733
- I'm Matt Collins.
- Albert Ford.

576
00:58:45,905 --> 00:58:47,873
Very happy to meet you.

577
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:57,072
- Dick Turpin.
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.

578
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,787
I don't know where he is!
Leave me alone!

579
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,728
Shut your mouth!
You shut your mouth!

580
00:59:15,702 --> 00:59:18,569
- You shut your mouth.
- I don't know where he is!

581
00:59:19,272 --> 00:59:21,297
- I don't know!
- Get in there.

582
00:59:22,175 --> 00:59:23,199
Shut up.

583
00:59:23,376 --> 00:59:25,867
- I don't know where he is!
- Shut up.

584
00:59:26,946 --> 00:59:28,413
- I don't know!
- Shut up.

585
00:59:28,581 --> 00:59:29,639
- Jesus.
- Shut up.

586
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,909
Jesse, he's just a kid.

587
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:35,981
He knows where his uncle Jim is and
that's gonna make him old soon enough.

588
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:38,453
- Maybe he doesn't know.
- He knows!

589
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:40,286
You need to ask and ask sometimes.

590
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:44,089
Sometimes a child don't remember so much
at first. But it'll come back to him.

591
00:59:46,132 --> 00:59:48,657
My goodness, she's about to rip off,
sweetie.

592
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,826
Just a little more here to get her started.

593
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,768
Then I think I can rip her off
like a page from a book.

594
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:56,033
Jesus, he can't even talk.

595
00:59:58,878 --> 01:00:00,436
Where's Jim?

596
01:00:00,613 --> 01:00:02,080
Where's Jim?

597
01:00:02,248 --> 01:00:04,216
Where's Jim? Where's Jim?

598
01:00:04,384 --> 01:00:07,751
Where's Jim? Where's Jim? Where's Jim?

599
01:00:08,087 --> 01:00:10,351
- Where's Jim?
- Quit it!

600
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,257
You bastard! I don't know where he is!

601
01:00:13,426 --> 01:00:16,293
You won't believe me!
You never even gave me a chance!

602
01:00:16,462 --> 01:00:18,453
You kept my... You kept my mouth shut!

603
01:00:19,832 --> 01:00:23,233
I never know where Jim is or
when he comes! So leave me alone.

604
01:00:23,403 --> 01:00:25,837
Get off me, you son of a bitch!

605
01:01:18,891 --> 01:01:20,825
I'm worn out.

606
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:23,927
I can't. No, see...

607
01:01:26,966 --> 01:01:29,526
My mind's all tangled anyway.

608
01:01:30,069 --> 01:01:33,527
Little deals like this
just make me feel dirty.

609
01:01:54,594 --> 01:01:56,619
Are you all right, Jesse?

610
01:02:25,191 --> 01:02:27,022
<i>Jesse was sick...</i>

611
01:02:27,193 --> 01:02:31,653
<i>...with rheums, and aches
and lung congestions.</i>

612
01:02:32,532 --> 01:02:35,831
<i>Insomnia stained
his eye sockets like soot.</i>

613
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:39,661
<i>He read auguries in
the snarled intestines of chickens...</i>

614
01:02:40,873 --> 01:02:44,434
<i>...or the blow of cat hair
released to the wind.</i>

615
01:02:45,244 --> 01:02:50,204
<i>And the omens promised bad luck,
which moated and dungeoned him.</i>

616
01:03:31,924 --> 01:03:34,484
How come it's you
that's gotta do all the chores?

617
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:38,892
Charley and Bob pay extry to Martha
so that they don't have to.

618
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:42,258
It still don't seem fair.

619
01:03:49,041 --> 01:03:50,565
Martha.

620
01:03:52,311 --> 01:03:54,905
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

621
01:03:59,719 --> 01:04:00,981
You come from Kentucky?

622
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:08,224
Why do you have your head in a hole,
Martha?

623
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:14,995
Wood and Dick had a shooting scrape
a few months ago.

624
01:04:16,569 --> 01:04:17,831
Cover the kettle, Ida.

625
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:25,407
And what did you and Dick
get in a scrape about?

626
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:33,275
Well, he tampered
with my daddy's wife...

627
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:36,819
...while a pork chop
burned on the skillet...

628
01:04:36,989 --> 01:04:38,513
...so I shot at him.

629
01:04:43,596 --> 01:04:47,999
Ida! Do not stick your thumb
in the cream when you skim it.

630
01:04:49,168 --> 01:04:54,367
His chicanery and his philandering ways...

631
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:56,508
...has instigated such malice.

632
01:04:56,676 --> 01:05:00,612
He's a yellow snake in the grass
and he can't be trusted, Martha.

633
01:05:03,516 --> 01:05:06,883
Dick told me a complete other version
of that affray.

634
01:05:08,354 --> 01:05:11,016
Wood Hite's downstairs.

635
01:05:11,724 --> 01:05:13,419
You mean he's here?

636
01:05:16,195 --> 01:05:18,891
Yeah, he come in late last night.

637
01:05:22,602 --> 01:05:23,626
Hey, simmer down!

638
01:05:23,803 --> 01:05:28,365
Don't get into a fracas up there, you boys!
I've got breakfast almost ready.

639
01:07:39,271 --> 01:07:41,466
He's still sucking air.

640
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:44,836
But I think he's a goner.

641
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:58,286
Maybe y'all better come wish him well
on his journey.

642
01:08:25,084 --> 01:08:26,551
Wood?

643
01:08:28,988 --> 01:08:31,252
You were a good fellow, Wood.

644
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:34,982
Oh, I sure hope you're not
in frightful pain, Wood.

645
01:08:35,561 --> 01:08:39,292
I'd get you something to drink,
but I'm afraid you'd just choke on it.

646
01:08:40,666 --> 01:08:42,827
Little Ida's gonna miss you.

647
01:08:43,002 --> 01:08:45,129
So is the rest of the family.

648
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:51,969
Well, one thing's settled.
Can't take him into Richmond.

649
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:54,103
Why not?

650
01:08:55,581 --> 01:08:58,141
Well, one, sheriff'll put Bob in jail.

651
01:08:58,317 --> 01:09:02,185
And two, Jesse'll find out his cousin
Wood's been shot in our house...

652
01:09:02,354 --> 01:09:05,755
...and then that'll be the end
of each and every one of us.

653
01:09:15,668 --> 01:09:19,331
"And in one merciless, violent thrust
broke in...

654
01:09:19,772 --> 01:09:22,605
...and carried all before him,
and scented and brewed...

655
01:09:22,775 --> 01:09:25,300
...reeking with blood of my virginity...

656
01:09:25,477 --> 01:09:30,005
...up to its utmost length in my body."

657
01:09:31,617 --> 01:09:34,484
He ain't disappeared,
if that's what you were hoping.

658
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:40,926
What chapter you on?

659
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:46,455
She's met some Algerian corsair
down at Gibraltar.

660
01:09:46,632 --> 01:09:48,930
Got herself all agitated.

661
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,703
How's that leg?

662
01:09:53,505 --> 01:09:57,669
Full of torment, Bob. Thanks for asking.

663
01:10:43,555 --> 01:10:46,217
<i>Blessed are the poor in spirit...</i>

664
01:10:46,392 --> 01:10:48,656
<i>...for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</i>

665
01:10:50,095 --> 01:10:55,658
Blessed are them that mourn,
for they shall be comforted.

666
01:10:57,803 --> 01:10:59,737
Blessed are the...

667
01:11:03,275 --> 01:11:04,799
Meek.

668
01:11:07,079 --> 01:11:08,910
Blessed are the meek.

669
01:11:44,883 --> 01:11:46,942
- Is it him?
- Yeah.

670
01:11:47,119 --> 01:11:50,145
Why is he here? Does he know
about Wood, do you think?

671
01:11:50,322 --> 01:11:52,722
I don't know. All I know is
he don't miss very much.

672
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:56,850
- What should I say about you if he asks?
- Tell him I'm in K.C. with Mattie.

673
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:03,365
He was buffalo hunting.
He was thrilled to meet yours truly.

674
01:12:03,535 --> 01:12:07,471
Yeah, over there in Europe there's only
two Americans they know for certain...

675
01:12:07,639 --> 01:12:10,574
...Mark Twain and Jesse James.

676
01:12:11,944 --> 01:12:15,175
- Why, it's the kid.
- How's everything?

677
01:12:17,616 --> 01:12:20,210
- I never take off my gun belts.
- Yeah?

678
01:12:20,386 --> 01:12:21,944
Good thinking.

679
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:30,324
Well, Charley, did you hurt your leg?

680
01:12:32,865 --> 01:12:34,890
Yeah, I slipped...
I slipped off the roof...

681
01:12:35,067 --> 01:12:38,662
...and I smacked down into a snow bank
like a ton of stupidness.

682
01:12:38,837 --> 01:12:41,499
One second I'm screaming,
"Whoa, Nelly!"

683
01:12:41,673 --> 01:12:44,335
Next second, poof,
I'm neck-deep in snow.

684
01:12:47,246 --> 01:12:51,080
Well, whatever possessed you
to climb a roof in December?

685
01:12:57,089 --> 01:13:00,547
There was a k... A kite. What am I saying?
There was a cat.

686
01:13:00,726 --> 01:13:03,126
A cat. It was on the roof
and I went after him.

687
01:13:03,453 --> 01:13:07,981
It was a tomcat yowling
and what all, and I slipped.

688
01:13:19,936 --> 01:13:23,030
I thought maybe your club foot
was gaining on you.

689
01:13:32,082 --> 01:13:33,709
Oh, yeah.

690
01:13:34,484 --> 01:13:38,716
Dick went to Kansas City to be
with his wife. He was here for a bit.

691
01:13:58,341 --> 01:14:01,242
Hey, here's a cute story, Jess.

692
01:14:01,411 --> 01:14:04,778
Bobby was what, 11 or 12...

693
01:14:04,948 --> 01:14:08,111
...and you were by far
his most admired personage.

694
01:14:08,618 --> 01:14:09,778
He couldn't get enough.

695
01:14:09,953 --> 01:14:14,151
It was "Jesse this" and "Jesse that"
and "Jesse this" from sunrise to sunset.

696
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:15,450
Fascinating.

697
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:17,354
No, there's more. This is cute.

698
01:14:17,527 --> 01:14:22,294
We're at supper and Bob asks,
"You know what size boot Jesse wears?"

699
01:14:22,465 --> 01:14:26,196
- Charley, Jesse doesn't wanna hear this.
- Shush, now, Bob, let me tell it.

700
01:14:26,369 --> 01:14:29,395
Bob says... He says, "You know
what size boot Jesse wears?"

701
01:14:29,572 --> 01:14:32,735
He says, "Six and a half." He says,
"Ain't that a big enough boot...

702
01:14:32,909 --> 01:14:34,706
...for a man 5'8"tall?"

703
01:14:34,878 --> 01:14:38,712
I decided to josh him a little, you know,
he being my kid brother and everything.

704
01:14:38,882 --> 01:14:41,976
So I said, "He doesn't have toes is why."

705
01:14:42,152 --> 01:14:43,676
That's a really stupid story.

706
01:14:43,853 --> 01:14:48,449
"He was dangling his feet off a culvert
and a catfish nibbled his toes off."

707
01:14:48,625 --> 01:14:51,355
Bob taxed himself trying to picture it.

708
01:14:58,234 --> 01:15:00,896
That'd be a good joke if it was funny.

709
01:15:01,738 --> 01:15:04,263
Isn't that a cute story, Jess?

710
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:17,017
Give me some more conversations, Bob.

711
01:15:22,092 --> 01:15:27,257
I got one. This one's about as crackerjack...
It's the one about your...

712
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:29,330
Let Bob tell it.

713
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,497
All right.

714
01:15:39,042 --> 01:15:41,033
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

715
01:15:41,211 --> 01:15:45,204
About how you and Jesse
have so much in common.

716
01:15:48,251 --> 01:15:49,912
Go on, Bob.

717
01:15:50,086 --> 01:15:52,054
Yeah, come on, Bob.

718
01:15:52,789 --> 01:15:55,053
Tell us a story.

719
01:15:56,993 --> 01:16:01,589
- Nope. No.
- Come on, entertain Jesse. He's here.

720
01:16:08,538 --> 01:16:10,062
Come on.

721
01:16:16,946 --> 01:16:20,848
Well, if you'll pardon my saying so,
I guess...

722
01:16:21,017 --> 01:16:25,078
...it is interesting the many ways
you and I overlap and whatnot.

723
01:16:26,389 --> 01:16:29,153
I mean, you begin with our daddies.

724
01:16:29,325 --> 01:16:32,294
Your daddy was a pastor
at the New Hope Baptist Church...

725
01:16:32,462 --> 01:16:37,195
...and my daddy was a pastor
at the church in Excelsior Springs.

726
01:16:38,635 --> 01:16:42,969
You're the youngest of three James boys,
and I'm the youngest of five Ford boys.

727
01:16:44,774 --> 01:16:47,436
Between Charley and me,
there's another brother, Wilbur...

728
01:16:47,610 --> 01:16:49,635
...with six letters in his name.

729
01:16:49,979 --> 01:16:55,576
And between Frank and you, is another
brother Robert, also with six letters.

730
01:16:55,785 --> 01:16:59,516
And my Christian name
is Robert, of course.

731
01:17:00,857 --> 01:17:03,018
You have blue eyes, I have blue eyes.

732
01:17:03,193 --> 01:17:07,186
You're 5'8"tall, I'm 5'8" tall.

733
01:17:11,935 --> 01:17:17,305
Me, I must have had a list as long as
your nightshirt when I was 12, but...

734
01:17:17,474 --> 01:17:20,910
...I seem to have lost some curiosities
over the years.

735
01:17:39,197 --> 01:17:41,392
Ain't he something?

736
01:17:53,978 --> 01:17:58,176
Did I ever tell you the story about
that scalawag, George Shepherd?

737
01:17:58,483 --> 01:18:00,383
Shepherd's one of
Quantrill's lieutenants.

738
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:03,247
He give me a story much like Bob's
what bring him to mind.

739
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:06,246
Going on about how much
we had in common, and so on...

740
01:18:06,424 --> 01:18:08,949
...so he could get in the gang.

741
01:18:09,127 --> 01:18:12,255
How could I have known
he had a grudge against me?

742
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:16,924
How could I have known
he was lying to get on my good side?

743
01:18:17,101 --> 01:18:22,095
I said, "George, come on aboard.
Glad to have you."

744
01:18:22,273 --> 01:18:27,074
George thought he was smart,
except he wasn't.

745
01:18:28,012 --> 01:18:31,140
One morning, George rides into camp...

746
01:18:31,315 --> 01:18:33,510
...and about 20 guns open up on him.

747
01:18:37,321 --> 01:18:41,781
See, old George, he only had one eye. You
gotta have two eyes, you wanna get Jesse.

748
01:18:46,631 --> 01:18:49,759
You ought not think of me
like you do George Shepherd.

749
01:18:51,102 --> 01:18:53,332
You brought him to mind.

750
01:18:54,272 --> 01:18:56,570
Well, it's not very flattering.

751
01:19:02,547 --> 01:19:05,345
Sure is good eating, Martha.

752
01:19:06,217 --> 01:19:08,447
Well, I'm so glad you enjoyed it.

753
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:10,780
How come George
had a grudge against you?

754
01:19:15,693 --> 01:19:19,789
I said, how come George
had a grudge against you?

755
01:19:25,503 --> 01:19:30,236
Well, you see, George had a nephew
he wanted me to protect during the war.

756
01:19:30,408 --> 01:19:32,638
This nephew had 5000 dollars on him.

757
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:37,406
It just so happens he winds up killed
and someone swipes that money.

758
01:19:37,582 --> 01:19:41,450
And when George is in prison,
someone whispers to him:

759
01:19:41,619 --> 01:19:45,350
"It was Jesse James
slit the boy's throat."

760
01:19:50,094 --> 01:19:52,562
It was just mean gossip, was it?

761
01:19:54,365 --> 01:19:57,664
Bob's the expert. Let's put it to him.

762
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:05,140
Oh, dear, I made him cranky.

763
01:20:05,309 --> 01:20:09,109
I'm not cranky. I just been
through this before is all.

764
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,443
Most people get around on making fun
of me. They don't ever let up.

765
01:20:12,617 --> 01:20:14,676
Someone's getting awful fresh over there.

766
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:17,548
Woman, shut your face for once.

767
01:20:24,562 --> 01:20:26,894
Don't want you to skip off
to your room and pout...

768
01:20:27,064 --> 01:20:29,589
...without knowing why I come by
for this visit.

769
01:20:30,401 --> 01:20:32,631
Why? So you could
tell us how sorry you are...

770
01:20:32,803 --> 01:20:35,363
...you had to slap our cousin Albert around?

771
01:20:48,986 --> 01:20:50,817
I come by...

772
01:20:50,988 --> 01:20:54,389
...to ask if one of you two Fords...

773
01:20:54,592 --> 01:20:57,959
...would care to ride with me
in a journey or two.

774
01:20:58,362 --> 01:21:01,729
I guess we both agree
it ought to be Charley.

775
01:21:01,899 --> 01:21:04,697
You've been acting sort of testy.

776
01:21:35,666 --> 01:21:37,896
Have you seen Wood Hite lately?

777
01:21:38,402 --> 01:21:41,929
No. Not at all.

778
01:21:49,914 --> 01:21:52,576
I swear that stew
had some squirrel meat in it.

779
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:55,446
- Still arguing with you, is it?
- Yeah.

780
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:58,154
- You're Charles Ford?
- Yes, ma'am.

781
01:21:58,322 --> 01:22:00,381
You've seen me once or twice before.

782
01:22:01,726 --> 01:22:03,660
I got a letter from George Hite.

783
01:22:04,295 --> 01:22:07,196
He hasn't seen hide nor hair of him.

784
01:22:08,699 --> 01:22:10,894
And you say you haven't seen Wood?

785
01:22:11,636 --> 01:22:14,799
No, I... I can't imagine where he could be.

786
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,224
Yeah?

787
01:22:44,402 --> 01:22:46,563
You finished with your sleeping?

788
01:22:48,072 --> 01:22:50,597
I could use a couple more hours
if it's no trouble.

789
01:23:02,253 --> 01:23:03,811
Yeah.

790
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:11,895
I been holding a discussion with myself
over if I ought to tell you this or no.

791
01:23:12,063 --> 01:23:14,725
My good side won out and...

792
01:23:15,934 --> 01:23:18,835
Well, I wanna make a clean breast
of things.

793
01:23:19,938 --> 01:23:24,102
Yeah, my mind's a little cobwebby
is the only drawback.

794
01:23:24,275 --> 01:23:29,076
I could use a little...
A little more sleep.

795
01:23:31,616 --> 01:23:33,641
You know I went to Kentucky?

796
01:23:34,619 --> 01:23:36,052
Yeah.

797
01:23:36,754 --> 01:23:39,188
I come back through Saline County and...

798
01:23:40,591 --> 01:23:42,456
...I think to myself:

799
01:23:42,994 --> 01:23:47,761
"Why not stop by and see Ed Miller?"

800
01:23:49,934 --> 01:23:51,663
So I do.

801
01:23:55,506 --> 01:23:58,839
Well, things are not to my satisfaction.

802
01:24:00,979 --> 01:24:03,743
Ed's got himself all worked up
over something.

803
01:24:05,283 --> 01:24:08,548
I can see that he's lying like a rug.

804
01:24:11,889 --> 01:24:14,983
So I say to myself, "Enough's enough."

805
01:24:15,493 --> 01:24:18,291
And I say to Ed, "Come on, Ed.

806
01:24:19,230 --> 01:24:21,562
Let's go for a ride."

807
01:24:23,368 --> 01:24:26,269
You understand what I'm saying?

808
01:24:27,505 --> 01:24:30,474
Going for a ride is like...

809
01:24:31,542 --> 01:24:34,670
Going for a ride
is like giving him what-for?

810
01:24:36,647 --> 01:24:38,376
Exactly.

811
01:24:42,854 --> 01:24:44,321
So...

812
01:24:47,025 --> 01:24:48,890
...Ed and Jesse...

813
01:24:51,295 --> 01:24:53,559
...they argue on the road.

814
01:24:58,002 --> 01:25:00,334
Did you ever count the stars?

815
01:25:03,808 --> 01:25:07,744
I can't ever get the same number.
They keep changing on me.

816
01:25:09,614 --> 01:25:12,640
I don't even know what a star is exactly.

817
01:25:15,353 --> 01:25:17,548
Well, your body knows.

818
01:25:18,456 --> 01:25:20,924
It's your mind that forgot.

819
01:25:30,701 --> 01:25:33,761
You go on ahead, partner.
I'll catch up with you.

820
01:26:13,978 --> 01:26:15,809
It's okay.

821
01:26:38,636 --> 01:26:42,094
It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.

822
01:26:45,109 --> 01:26:47,577
And when push came to shove...

823
01:26:54,452 --> 01:26:56,852
...Jesse shot and killed him.

824
01:27:00,191 --> 01:27:02,056
Jesse did.

825
01:27:04,529 --> 01:27:06,258
You got it.

826
01:27:08,299 --> 01:27:09,664
You...

827
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:28,218
So, you see, your...

828
01:27:28,419 --> 01:27:30,887
Your cousin, he got off easy.

829
01:27:31,055 --> 01:27:32,647
I was just playing with Albert.

830
01:27:34,158 --> 01:27:37,821
Yeah, I made him squeal
once or twice myself.

831
01:27:38,129 --> 01:27:41,189
I'm just not as thorough as you are.

832
01:27:52,476 --> 01:27:55,502
You got a tale to swap with me now?

833
01:28:04,288 --> 01:28:06,688
I don't get your meaning.

834
01:28:08,759 --> 01:28:14,061
Seems to me, if you have something
to confess in exchange...

835
01:28:14,232 --> 01:28:16,393
...it'd only be right...

836
01:28:17,301 --> 01:28:20,634
...that you'd spit it out now.

837
01:28:32,450 --> 01:28:34,577
I can't think of a single thing.

838
01:28:37,488 --> 01:28:40,252
About Wood Hite, for example.

839
01:28:40,424 --> 01:28:45,259
I'm not gonna... I been saying over and
over I can't figure out where he's gone.

840
01:28:45,429 --> 01:28:48,489
Now, I'm not gonna change my story
just to have something to spit.

841
01:28:48,666 --> 01:28:51,362
- Why was your brother so agitated?
- Which?

842
01:28:52,336 --> 01:28:53,428
Bob.

843
01:28:54,805 --> 01:28:57,797
That's just his way. He's antsy.

844
01:28:58,576 --> 01:29:00,009
You know?

845
01:29:16,193 --> 01:29:18,787
You go on back to sleep now.

846
01:29:20,431 --> 01:29:23,559
You got me agitated now, you see?

847
01:29:29,974 --> 01:29:34,172
Yeah, just ain't no peace
when old Jesse's around.

848
01:29:34,712 --> 01:29:37,704
You ought to pity my poor wife.

849
01:29:40,384 --> 01:29:42,545
Ed Miller was a good friend of mine.

850
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:46,156
He introduced me to you
at that one poker game.

851
01:29:46,891 --> 01:29:50,918
I'm a little angry with you, if you
wanna know the God's honest truth.

852
01:29:53,397 --> 01:29:55,888
You ought to pity me too.

853
01:30:41,445 --> 01:30:45,381
<i>As proof of his confederacy with
the James Gang, Bob told the authorities...</i>

854
01:30:45,549 --> 01:30:49,041
<i>...that Dick Liddil was sleeping over
at the rented farmhouse...</i>

855
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:52,053
<i>...while his ruined leg mended.</i>

856
01:30:57,061 --> 01:31:00,895
<i>And then, created a map
of the Harbison property...</i>

857
01:31:02,066 --> 01:31:07,299
<i>...leaving out the creek where
Wood Hite's remains now moldered.</i>

858
01:31:08,072 --> 01:31:10,267
Right, you boys are cornered!

859
01:31:10,441 --> 01:31:14,969
Come on out peaceably
and nobody'll get shot up!

860
01:31:20,117 --> 01:31:21,141
Don't shoot!

861
01:31:25,756 --> 01:31:27,747
Come on out and show yourself!

862
01:31:42,807 --> 01:31:44,331
Hello.

863
01:31:44,675 --> 01:31:46,302
We got him.

864
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:48,735
Give me that Colt, son.

865
01:31:53,684 --> 01:31:56,244
- All right.
- Andrew James Liddil...

866
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:59,412
...I have a warrant here
for your arrest...

867
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:03,959
<i>Snowstorms would move over Missouri
that Sunday, February 19th...</i>

868
01:32:04,128 --> 01:32:07,120
<i>...shutting down commerce
for more than two days.</i>

869
01:32:08,766 --> 01:32:11,496
- Go, go, go.
- Are the papers here?

870
01:32:11,669 --> 01:32:15,298
- He wanted to know if the papers are here.
- I don't care what he wants.

871
01:32:15,473 --> 01:32:17,338
<i>Yet this wouldn't prevent Robert Ford...</i>

872
01:32:17,508 --> 01:32:19,908
<i>...from presenting himself
to Governor Crittenden...</i>

873
01:32:20,077 --> 01:32:23,171
<i>...at the Craig Rifles Ball on Wednesday.</i>

874
01:32:23,347 --> 01:32:26,908
I deem it a great privilege
on this glorious occasion...

875
01:32:27,084 --> 01:32:29,075
...to recognize publicly...

876
01:32:29,253 --> 01:32:31,915
...the intelligent and effective assistance...

877
01:32:32,089 --> 01:32:36,890
...that Captain Henry Craig has rendered
the state of Missouri and myself...

878
01:32:37,061 --> 01:32:40,519
...in our joint quest
to rid Jackson County...

879
01:32:40,931 --> 01:32:42,899
...of the James band.

880
01:32:43,067 --> 01:32:45,695
The task that Captain Craig
has assumed...

881
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:50,000
...will require fearless courage,
extraordinary vigilance...

882
01:32:50,174 --> 01:32:53,109
...and an unerring selection
of instrumentalities.

883
01:32:54,278 --> 01:32:58,942
Well, I've gotten the signal from my wife
that enough is enough.

884
01:32:59,116 --> 01:33:01,482
However, before I sit...

885
01:33:01,652 --> 01:33:04,780
...I would like to ask you
to join me in a toast...

886
01:33:05,222 --> 01:33:08,919
...to a great son
of the state of Missouri...

887
01:33:09,093 --> 01:33:12,927
...my friend, Henry Craig.
- Here, here.

888
01:33:25,609 --> 01:33:27,236
Yes.

889
01:33:28,212 --> 01:33:30,043
Just let my attorney know.

890
01:33:37,688 --> 01:33:40,953
Who is that? Who is it?

891
01:33:41,292 --> 01:33:42,850
Get out of the way now.

892
01:33:52,836 --> 01:33:56,932
You know, you're more goddamn trouble
than you're worth, Bob.

893
01:33:57,107 --> 01:33:58,802
I was just gonna say hello.

894
01:33:58,976 --> 01:34:02,207
No, you weren't gonna do that, Bob.
That's not why you're down here.

895
01:34:02,379 --> 01:34:07,646
You think it's your goddamn coming-out.
You think you're the belle of the ball.

896
01:34:07,818 --> 01:34:12,050
Now you get upstairs and try to keep your
identity secret, you silly little bastard.

897
01:34:12,222 --> 01:34:15,089
The governor'll see you in good time.
Take him up, boys.

898
01:34:20,598 --> 01:34:22,725
<i>Bob would later be cross-examined
repeatedly...</i>

899
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:27,098
<i>...about the exact nature of the deal
he had made with the authorities.</i>

900
01:34:27,271 --> 01:34:30,206
<i>And he was never consistent
in his recollections.</i>

901
01:34:34,378 --> 01:34:38,610
My wife's asleep in the other room,
so let's speak as quietly as we can.

902
01:34:39,283 --> 01:34:41,513
So you're Dick Little.

903
01:34:43,387 --> 01:34:44,911
Liddil.

904
01:34:45,656 --> 01:34:47,590
I beg your pardon?

905
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:49,483
I spell it with two D's.

906
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:52,026
He's given us a full confession, governor.

907
01:34:52,196 --> 01:34:54,289
Newspapers haven't caught onto it yet.

908
01:34:54,465 --> 01:34:57,992
And you've guaranteed him
a conditional pardon...

909
01:34:58,168 --> 01:35:02,036
...and amnesty for all the robberies
he's committed.

910
01:35:03,674 --> 01:35:04,902
You Robert Ford?

911
01:35:08,412 --> 01:35:09,709
How old are you?

912
01:35:11,782 --> 01:35:13,215
Twenty.

913
01:35:13,517 --> 01:35:16,042
You surrender to Sheriff Timberlake
as well?

914
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:20,122
No, no, governor. That's his brother,
Charley Ford, he's in the James Gang.

915
01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:23,020
But little Bob here,
we got nothing on Bob.

916
01:35:23,193 --> 01:35:25,753
He's just acting in capacity as a...

917
01:35:27,965 --> 01:35:30,126
...private detective.

918
01:35:31,301 --> 01:35:33,326
Jesse James sent me a telegram
last month...

919
01:35:33,504 --> 01:35:36,667
...saying he'd kill me
if he had to wreck a train to do it.

920
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:39,468
He said once I got in his hands,
he'd cut my heart out...

921
01:35:39,643 --> 01:35:42,134
...and eat it in strips like it was bacon.

922
01:35:42,312 --> 01:35:44,246
I'll wreck his train first.

923
01:35:51,822 --> 01:35:55,986
I'm sorry, Your Excellency.
I was thinking about something else.

924
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:58,492
Jesse James is nothing more
than a public outlaw...

925
01:35:58,662 --> 01:36:01,460
...who made his reputation
by stealing whatever he wanted...

926
01:36:01,632 --> 01:36:03,862
...killing whoever got in his way.

927
01:36:04,034 --> 01:36:07,629
You'll hear some fools say he's getting back
at Republicans and Union men...

928
01:36:07,805 --> 01:36:10,569
...for the wrongs his family suffered
during the war.

929
01:36:10,741 --> 01:36:15,474
But his victims have scarcely been selected
with reference to their political views.

930
01:36:15,979 --> 01:36:18,675
I'm saying his sins will soon find him out.

931
01:36:18,849 --> 01:36:21,511
I'm saying his cup of iniquity is full.

932
01:36:21,685 --> 01:36:24,381
I'm saying Jesse James
is a desperate case...

933
01:36:24,688 --> 01:36:27,589
...and may require a desperate remedy.

934
01:36:30,928 --> 01:36:34,022
Y'all got the right man for the job.

935
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:52,644
Come on. Come on, now.

936
01:36:53,217 --> 01:36:54,844
Come on, now.

937
01:37:39,229 --> 01:37:41,789
Have you ever considered suicide?

938
01:37:43,834 --> 01:37:49,170
I can't say that I have. There's always
something else I wanted to do.

939
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:56,110
Or my predicaments changed,
or I saw my hardships from a different slant.

940
01:37:56,280 --> 01:38:00,683
You know all what can happen.
It never seemed respectable.

941
01:38:07,457 --> 01:38:10,290
I'll tell you one thing that's for certain.

942
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:14,419
You won't mind dying
once you've peeked over the other side.

943
01:38:18,202 --> 01:38:21,228
You'll no more wanna go back
to your body than...

944
01:38:21,405 --> 01:38:23,873
...you'd wanna spoon up your own puke.

945
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:33,178
Hey, since we're looking to rob banks...

946
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:37,946
...I was wondering if we could
add another fella to the gang...

947
01:38:38,121 --> 01:38:41,750
...and sort of see if we couldn't
come out of our next job alive.

948
01:38:44,228 --> 01:38:49,222
Bob wanted to know could he ride with us
next time we took on a savings bank or...

949
01:38:55,539 --> 01:38:58,007
A savings bank or a...

950
01:38:59,743 --> 01:39:01,472
A railroad.

951
01:39:08,852 --> 01:39:12,151
Bob isn't much more than a boy
to most appearances.

952
01:39:12,322 --> 01:39:15,086
But there's about two tons
of sand in him.

953
01:39:15,259 --> 01:39:18,490
And he'll stand with a shooter
when that's what's called for.

954
01:39:18,662 --> 01:39:22,928
And he's smart too.
He's about as intricate as they come.

955
01:39:25,035 --> 01:39:27,765
You forget I already met the kid.

956
01:39:29,072 --> 01:39:31,802
Hell, he surely thinks highly of you.

957
01:39:32,342 --> 01:39:35,106
All of America thinks highly of me.

958
01:39:35,812 --> 01:39:39,043
Still, not like you got two million names
to snatch out of a sock...

959
01:39:39,216 --> 01:39:41,377
...whenever you need a third man.

960
01:39:44,888 --> 01:39:47,914
I can see you trying to
wear me down on this.

961
01:39:48,091 --> 01:39:50,286
That's my main intention.

962
01:39:59,369 --> 01:40:02,031
<i>Robberies would be conceived
but never carried out...</i>

963
01:40:02,205 --> 01:40:05,766
<i>...in Nebraska, Colorado and Missouri.</i>

964
01:40:06,410 --> 01:40:07,502
<i>During this time...</i>

965
01:40:07,678 --> 01:40:11,705
<i>...Henry Craig enjoined Robert Ford to return
to Elias' Grocery Store in Richmond...</i>

966
01:40:11,882 --> 01:40:14,942
<i>...and await instructions
from Sheriff James Timberlake.</i>

967
01:40:15,385 --> 01:40:17,649
All right, three cans...

968
01:40:17,821 --> 01:40:21,552
...peaches. Two cans...

969
01:40:22,826 --> 01:40:25,351
Two cans sifted peas.

970
01:40:25,662 --> 01:40:27,289
One bottle...

971
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:33,297
...Mary's Morning Tonic, and a half...

972
01:40:36,373 --> 01:40:38,933
Half a sack of flour.

973
01:40:40,110 --> 01:40:42,169
I'll be right with you.

974
01:40:58,161 --> 01:41:00,493
I haven't seen any sign of him.

975
01:41:01,965 --> 01:41:04,331
Well, do you know where he's living?

976
01:41:05,435 --> 01:41:06,800
No.

977
01:41:07,971 --> 01:41:09,404
No?

978
01:41:12,142 --> 01:41:14,906
Well, I can't guess how he does it...

979
01:41:15,078 --> 01:41:19,378
...but he is always knowledgeable
about what's going on.

980
01:41:19,549 --> 01:41:23,849
He's gonna know I've been here with you.
You ought to take that for granted.

981
01:41:26,356 --> 01:41:30,315
And he will kill you if he gets the chance.

982
01:41:33,563 --> 01:41:36,123
Are you willing to risk that?

983
01:41:40,737 --> 01:41:42,466
Yes, I am.

984
01:41:45,542 --> 01:41:47,271
I've been a nobody all my life.

985
01:41:48,211 --> 01:41:50,042
I was the baby.

986
01:41:50,313 --> 01:41:53,749
I was the one they made promises to
that they never kept.

987
01:41:54,951 --> 01:41:59,650
And ever since I can remember it,
Jesse James has been as big as a tree.

988
01:42:03,093 --> 01:42:05,357
I'm prepared for this, Jim...

989
01:42:06,263 --> 01:42:08,424
...and I'm gonna accomplish it.

990
01:42:08,665 --> 01:42:10,758
I know I won't get
but this one opportunity...

991
01:42:10,934 --> 01:42:13,835
...and you can bet your life
I'm not gonna spoil it.

992
01:42:25,849 --> 01:42:26,907
Well...

993
01:42:28,118 --> 01:42:30,109
...wait for your chance.

994
01:42:30,620 --> 01:42:34,021
Don't let yourself be found alone with him,
and do not...

995
01:42:34,891 --> 01:42:37,291
...let him get behind you.

996
01:43:05,422 --> 01:43:06,616
You been chosen.

997
01:43:11,595 --> 01:43:13,187
Well, what do you mean?

998
01:43:14,464 --> 01:43:16,955
Well, your brother said that
you might wanna join us.

999
01:43:17,134 --> 01:43:20,467
But maybe you like this grocery store
more than you said you did.

1000
01:43:23,773 --> 01:43:25,832
- So you missed me?
- Oh, yeah.

1001
01:43:26,510 --> 01:43:29,172
I been crying myself to sleep every night.

1002
01:43:38,722 --> 01:43:40,713
Don't let him see us so much as wink.

1003
01:43:40,891 --> 01:43:44,725
He's suspicious as a damn coyote,
and he don't trust you one iota.

1004
01:43:45,428 --> 01:43:47,225
- Well, I guess that makes...
- Hey.

1005
01:43:47,397 --> 01:43:51,857
He already put away Ed Miller. He said so
like it was something piddly he'd done.

1006
01:44:32,842 --> 01:44:37,074
If we're ever alone for more than a minute,
I'd like a chance to talk to you further.

1007
01:45:16,820 --> 01:45:19,050
They gave me ten days.

1008
01:45:22,926 --> 01:45:24,450
For what?

1009
01:45:26,429 --> 01:45:28,294
For arresting him.

1010
01:45:34,371 --> 01:45:36,032
You and me, huh?

1011
01:45:39,676 --> 01:45:42,941
It's gonna happen one way or another,
Charley. It's gonna happen.

1012
01:45:43,113 --> 01:45:45,707
So it might as well be us
who get rich on it.

1013
01:45:45,882 --> 01:45:49,181
- Bob, he's our friend.
- He murdered Ed Miller.

1014
01:45:49,819 --> 01:45:52,913
And he's gonna murder Liddil and Cummins
if the chance ever comes.

1015
01:45:54,357 --> 01:45:58,987
It seems to me Jesse's riding from
man to man, saying goodbye to the gang.

1016
01:46:00,497 --> 01:46:02,863
So your friendship could put you
under the pansies.

1017
01:46:04,934 --> 01:46:09,394
I'll grind it fine in my mind, Bob. I can't
go any further than that right now.

1018
01:46:12,976 --> 01:46:14,409
You'll come around.

1019
01:46:15,545 --> 01:46:18,013
You think it's all made up, don't you?

1020
01:46:18,181 --> 01:46:21,514
You think it's all yarns
and newspaper stories.

1021
01:46:29,392 --> 01:46:31,724
He's just a human being.

1022
01:46:39,969 --> 01:46:43,097
From now on, you two
won't go anywhere without me.

1023
01:46:43,873 --> 01:46:48,435
From now on, you'll ask for my permission!
From now on, you'll ask to be excused!

1024
01:47:44,367 --> 01:47:48,667
Charley, take them horses
around the barn. Bob, you go on inside.

1025
01:47:49,506 --> 01:47:50,837
- Hello, Mary.
- Hi.

1026
01:47:51,007 --> 01:47:54,170
Look at this rotten parsnip
I found in the compost heap.

1027
01:48:04,387 --> 01:48:06,287
You never mentioned Bob would be here.

1028
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:13,552
Maybe he was saving it
as a pleasant surprise.

1029
01:48:18,168 --> 01:48:20,830
Got two cousins for company now.

1030
01:48:30,547 --> 01:48:32,845
How it's gonna be is...

1031
01:48:33,216 --> 01:48:37,414
...we'll leave next Monday afternoon
and ride down to Platte City.

1032
01:48:40,290 --> 01:48:42,224
How far is that from Kansas City?

1033
01:48:43,927 --> 01:48:46,760
Platte City's 30 miles south.

1034
01:48:48,398 --> 01:48:52,994
You and me and Charley'll
sleep in the woods overnight...

1035
01:48:53,503 --> 01:48:57,906
...and we'll strike the Wells Bank
sometime before the court recesses.

1036
01:49:02,712 --> 01:49:05,647
What time will that be exactly?

1037
01:49:11,287 --> 01:49:13,812
Well, you don't need to know that.

1038
01:49:28,838 --> 01:49:31,807
You know, I'm real comfortable
with your brother.

1039
01:49:32,041 --> 01:49:34,566
Hell, he's ugly as sin,
he smells like a skunk...

1040
01:49:35,378 --> 01:49:38,814
...and he's so ignorant
he couldn't drive nails in the snow...

1041
01:49:38,982 --> 01:49:41,473
...but he's sort of easy to be around.

1042
01:49:41,985 --> 01:49:44,783
I can't say the same for you, Bob.

1043
01:49:48,191 --> 01:49:50,557
Well, I'm sorry to hear you say that.

1044
01:49:52,428 --> 01:49:56,455
You know how it is when you're
with your girlfriend and the moon's out...

1045
01:49:56,633 --> 01:50:00,694
...and you know she wants to be kissed,
even though she never said so?

1046
01:50:04,107 --> 01:50:05,540
Yeah.

1047
01:50:08,278 --> 01:50:11,645
Well, you're giving me signs
that grieve my soul...

1048
01:50:12,515 --> 01:50:14,642
...and make me wonder...

1049
01:50:15,051 --> 01:50:17,417
...maybe your mind's
been changed about me.

1050
01:50:17,754 --> 01:50:21,212
Well, what do you want me to do?
Swear my good faith on the Bible?

1051
01:50:38,708 --> 01:50:40,642
You two having a spat?

1052
01:50:45,915 --> 01:50:48,406
I was getting ready to be angry.

1053
01:50:53,890 --> 01:50:56,222
Sit over here closer, kid.

1054
01:50:58,461 --> 01:50:59,723
Come on.

1055
01:51:10,873 --> 01:51:13,205
Charley, you'll stay with the animals.

1056
01:51:13,876 --> 01:51:15,776
Me and the kid...

1057
01:51:15,945 --> 01:51:19,904
...will walk into that bank
just before noon.

1058
01:51:21,784 --> 01:51:24,412
Bob will move that cashier...

1059
01:51:24,954 --> 01:51:28,185
...away from the shotgun
that's under the counter...

1060
01:51:28,358 --> 01:51:31,225
...and I'll creep up behind that cashier...

1061
01:51:31,394 --> 01:51:33,726
...and I'll cock his head back like so.

1062
01:51:33,997 --> 01:51:35,021
And I'll say:

1063
01:51:35,198 --> 01:51:37,928
"How come an off-scouring
like you is still sucking air...

1064
01:51:38,101 --> 01:51:40,365
...when so many of mine
are in coffins?" I'll say:

1065
01:51:40,536 --> 01:51:43,869
"How did you get to reach 20
without leaking out all over your clothes?"

1066
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:48,208
And if I don't like his attitude,
I will slit that phildoodle so deep...

1067
01:51:48,511 --> 01:51:51,537
...he will flop on the floor like a fish.

1068
01:51:55,218 --> 01:51:57,584
My God, what just happened?

1069
01:52:06,829 --> 01:52:10,196
Boy, I could hear your gears grinding...

1070
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:13,867
...hear your little motor wondering,
"My gosh, what's next?

1071
01:52:14,037 --> 01:52:15,402
What's happening to me?"

1072
01:52:17,273 --> 01:52:19,138
You were precious to behold, Bob.

1073
01:52:19,308 --> 01:52:21,936
You were white as spit in a cotton field.

1074
01:52:22,478 --> 01:52:24,946
You got him. You got him.

1075
01:52:26,582 --> 01:52:30,643
You wanna know how that feels?
Unpleasant. I honestly can't recommend it.

1076
01:52:36,159 --> 01:52:38,627
The old Charley looked stricken!

1077
01:52:39,295 --> 01:52:41,126
I was. I was.

1078
01:52:41,297 --> 01:52:46,291
"This is plumb unexpected," old Charley
was thinking."That done ruined my day."

1079
01:52:54,077 --> 01:52:55,510
Hell. Hell.

1080
01:53:26,476 --> 01:53:30,344
<i>Jesse slept with Bob
in the children's room that night.</i>

1081
01:53:31,647 --> 01:53:34,241
<i>And Bob remained awake.</i>

1082
01:53:37,086 --> 01:53:40,453
<i>He could see that there was a gun
on the nightstand.</i>

1083
01:53:41,324 --> 01:53:45,317
<i>He could imagine its cold nickel
inside his grip...</i>

1084
01:53:46,229 --> 01:53:49,721
<i>...its two-pound weight
reached out and aimed.</i>

1085
01:54:20,863 --> 01:54:22,956
I need to go to the privy.

1086
01:54:24,167 --> 01:54:27,568
You think you do, but you don't.

1087
01:54:50,793 --> 01:54:52,954
You wait for grace, now.

1088
01:54:53,896 --> 01:54:57,229
- Thank you, Mama.
- Thank you, Zee. God, that looks good.

1089
01:54:57,400 --> 01:54:59,027
- Thank you, Zee.
- You're welcome.

1090
01:54:59,202 --> 01:55:02,296
Well, is this fit to eat or will it just do?

1091
01:55:05,208 --> 01:55:07,301
Woman's cooking's
always been a scandal.

1092
01:55:07,476 --> 01:55:09,842
Cut her meat and the whole table moves.

1093
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:12,839
You want a biscuit?
You gonna have a biscuit?

1094
01:55:13,015 --> 01:55:16,815
Here's some butter.
Come on. Come on.

1095
01:55:18,754 --> 01:55:20,051
Oh, shoot.

1096
01:55:20,223 --> 01:55:24,023
<i>And so it went,
Jesse was increasingly cavalier...</i>

1097
01:55:24,193 --> 01:55:27,924
<i>...merry, moody, fey...</i>

1098
01:55:28,097 --> 01:55:30,190
<i>...unpredictable.</i>

1099
01:55:31,734 --> 01:55:34,862
<i>He camouflaged his depressions
and derangements...</i>

1100
01:55:35,037 --> 01:55:39,030
<i>...with masquerades
of extreme cordiality, courtesy...</i>

1101
01:55:39,208 --> 01:55:41,972
<i>...and goodwill towards others.</i>

1102
01:55:43,045 --> 01:55:47,311
<i>But even as he jested,
or tickled his boy in the ribs...</i>

1103
01:55:47,483 --> 01:55:51,112
<i>...Jesse would look over at Bob
with melancholy eyes...</i>

1104
01:55:51,287 --> 01:55:55,246
<i>...as if the two were meshed
in an intimate communication.</i>

1105
01:55:58,060 --> 01:56:00,688
<i>Bob was certain that the man
had unriddled him...</i>

1106
01:56:00,863 --> 01:56:03,525
<i>...had seen through his reasons
for coming along...</i>

1107
01:56:03,699 --> 01:56:07,692
<i>...that Jesse could forecast each of
Bob's possible moves and inclinations...</i>

1108
01:56:07,870 --> 01:56:09,701
<i>...and was only acting the innocent...</i>

1109
01:56:09,872 --> 01:56:14,809
<i>...in order to lull Bob
into stupid tranquility and miscalculation.</i>

1110
01:56:36,499 --> 01:56:38,694
How long you been studying me?

1111
01:56:40,603 --> 01:56:43,333
You're gonna break a lot of hearts.

1112
01:56:51,247 --> 01:56:52,441
How do you mean?

1113
01:57:01,691 --> 01:57:03,420
It's a present.

1114
01:57:08,097 --> 01:57:09,655
It's heavy.

1115
01:57:10,232 --> 01:57:12,359
Well, you gonna look inside?

1116
01:57:13,936 --> 01:57:15,733
It's April Fools' Day, you know.

1117
01:57:16,305 --> 01:57:18,136
It ain't no joke.

1118
01:57:25,648 --> 01:57:27,206
Oh, such extravagance.

1119
01:57:28,751 --> 01:57:31,447
Don't that nickel just shine, though?

1120
01:57:31,654 --> 01:57:33,212
It's more than I could hope for.

1121
01:57:33,389 --> 01:57:36,187
I figured that granddaddy Colt
may blow into fragments...

1122
01:57:36,359 --> 01:57:39,123
...next time you try
to squeeze the trigger.

1123
01:57:39,362 --> 01:57:41,762
Well, you might have something there.

1124
01:57:42,264 --> 01:57:44,892
Tom, supper's ready.

1125
01:57:46,068 --> 01:57:48,093
I'll be right there, sweetheart.

1126
01:57:48,270 --> 01:57:50,568
I might be too excited to eat.

1127
01:57:53,843 --> 01:57:56,334
You know what John Newman Edwards
once wrote about me?

1128
01:57:57,380 --> 01:58:00,213
He said I didn't trust
two men in 10,000...

1129
01:58:00,383 --> 01:58:03,045
...and even them I was cautious around.

1130
01:58:03,853 --> 01:58:05,844
Government's sort of run me ragged.

1131
01:58:07,823 --> 01:58:10,815
I'm going the long way around the barn
to say that...

1132
01:58:10,993 --> 01:58:14,622
...I been feeling cornered
and just plain ornery as of late...

1133
01:58:15,364 --> 01:58:20,028
...and I'd be pleased if you'd accept
that gun as my way of apologizing.

1134
01:58:22,405 --> 01:58:25,203
Heaven knows I'd be ornerier
if I were in your position.

1135
01:58:25,374 --> 01:58:28,468
No. No, I haven't been acting correctly.

1136
01:58:30,279 --> 01:58:33,806
Seems I hardly recognize myself
when I'm greased.

1137
01:58:36,886 --> 01:58:39,377
I go on journeys out of my body...

1138
01:58:39,555 --> 01:58:43,651
...and look at my red hands
and my mean face...

1139
01:58:44,427 --> 01:58:48,158
...and I wonder about that man
that's gone so wrong.

1140
01:58:51,934 --> 01:58:54,960
I've been becoming a problem to myself.

1141
01:59:07,616 --> 01:59:08,981
Well...

1142
01:59:15,624 --> 01:59:20,254
- I better wash my hands if supper's on.
- Yeah, go ahead.

1143
01:59:33,609 --> 01:59:36,544
<i>The day before he died was Palm Sunday.</i>

1144
01:59:37,580 --> 01:59:40,879
<i>And Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Howard,
their two children...</i>

1145
01:59:41,050 --> 01:59:43,109
<i>...and their cousin Charles Johnson...</i>

1146
01:59:43,285 --> 01:59:48,450
<i>...strolled to the Second Presbyterian
Church to attend the 10:00 service.</i>

1147
01:59:50,860 --> 01:59:53,158
<i>Bob remained at the cottage...</i>

1148
01:59:53,329 --> 01:59:56,730
<i>...and slyly migrated from room to room.</i>

1149
01:59:59,335 --> 02:00:01,166
<i>He walked into the master bedroom...</i>

1150
02:00:01,337 --> 02:00:05,103
<i>...and inventoried the clothes
on the hangers and hooks.</i>

1151
02:00:11,413 --> 02:00:14,746
<i>He sipped from the water glass
on the vanity.</i>

1152
02:00:17,086 --> 02:00:21,352
<i>He smelled the talcum and lilacs
on Jesse's pillowcase.</i>

1153
02:00:29,265 --> 02:00:31,460
<i>His fingers skittered over his ribs...</i>

1154
02:00:31,634 --> 02:00:35,502
<i>...to construe the scars
where Jesse was twice shot.</i>

1155
02:00:39,308 --> 02:00:43,904
<i>He manufactured a middle finger
that was missing the top two knuckles.</i>

1156
02:00:51,353 --> 02:00:54,288
<i>He imagined himself at 34.</i>

1157
02:00:56,292 --> 02:00:59,284
<i>He imagined himself in a coffin.</i>

1158
02:01:01,363 --> 02:01:03,092
<i>He considered possibilities...</i>

1159
02:01:03,265 --> 02:01:06,564
<i>...and everything wonderful
that could come true.</i>

1160
02:01:34,363 --> 02:01:36,297
He's not gonna kill us.

1161
02:01:41,537 --> 02:01:43,698
Yeah, he is.

1162
02:01:46,008 --> 02:01:48,499
Well, I'll stay awake so he can't.

1163
02:02:01,857 --> 02:02:04,291
You're imagining things.

1164
02:02:16,538 --> 02:02:18,506
Ain't gonna be no Platte City.

1165
02:02:20,242 --> 02:02:22,870
That's Jesse fooling with us.

1166
02:02:39,295 --> 02:02:41,525
Go to sleep, Charley.

1167
02:03:15,130 --> 02:03:16,722
Morning.

1168
02:03:20,536 --> 02:03:22,060
Charley.

1169
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:54,334
Bob, how much did you want to eat?

1170
02:03:58,841 --> 02:04:01,275
I'm feeling sort of peculiar.

1171
02:04:20,496 --> 02:04:22,964
Why is it you're looking so interested?

1172
02:04:24,433 --> 02:04:27,334
You think it's intelligent
to go out like that...

1173
02:04:27,503 --> 02:04:29,334
...so all creation can see your guns?

1174
02:04:47,089 --> 02:04:48,522
Hi.

1175
02:04:58,834 --> 02:05:01,735
Come on, let's go see
what your mama's doing.

1176
02:05:02,871 --> 02:05:04,998
Timmy, get that door, would you?

1177
02:05:09,144 --> 02:05:12,307
- Well, you lost your shoe, sweetheart.
- Yeah, I did.

1178
02:05:12,481 --> 02:05:16,611
That's gonna be a problem.
They don't sell those one at a time.

1179
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:20,179
We lost a shoe, Mama.

1180
02:05:21,790 --> 02:05:24,350
Will you put that up for Daddy,
would you?

1181
02:05:27,429 --> 02:05:30,193
- What you doing, you lose a shoe?
- Yeah.

1182
02:05:46,915 --> 02:05:50,316
It's only meant to go on top,
to complement.

1183
02:05:50,586 --> 02:05:52,417
Yeah, I know. Sometimes, I...

1184
02:06:17,012 --> 02:06:19,913
Bob, everything's getting cold!

1185
02:06:20,616 --> 02:06:24,017
- Where's Mary?
- She's outside, darling.

1186
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:26,817
Mary?

1187
02:06:30,592 --> 02:06:33,117
What do you think goes on
in that noggin of his?

1188
02:06:36,131 --> 02:06:37,826
Nothing.

1189
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:41,198
I was talking about his mind, not yours.

1190
02:06:42,137 --> 02:06:43,866
Oh, yeah.

1191
02:06:44,306 --> 02:06:46,001
Oh, I get it.

1192
02:07:41,430 --> 02:07:43,398
Well, hello now.

1193
02:07:43,799 --> 02:07:46,825
"The arrest and confession
of Dick Liddil."

1194
02:07:52,074 --> 02:07:54,235
You don't say so.

1195
02:08:08,557 --> 02:08:10,650
That's very strange.

1196
02:08:11,093 --> 02:08:13,994
Says here Dick surrendered
three weeks ago.

1197
02:08:14,162 --> 02:08:16,756
You must have been
right in the neighborhood.

1198
02:08:17,432 --> 02:08:20,060
Well, apparently, they kept it a secret.

1199
02:08:31,279 --> 02:08:34,339
If I get to Kansas City soon,
I'll ask somebody about it.

1200
02:09:15,023 --> 02:09:16,718
You two ready?

1201
02:09:20,429 --> 02:09:23,091
I will be, by noon.

1202
02:09:55,997 --> 02:09:58,659
<i>There is a ship
She sails the sea</i>

1203
02:09:58,834 --> 02:10:01,598
<i>She's loaded deep
As deep can be</i>

1204
02:10:01,770 --> 02:10:04,000
<i>But not as deep
As the love I'm in</i>

1205
02:10:04,573 --> 02:10:08,202
<i>I know not if I sink or swim</i>

1206
02:10:09,244 --> 02:10:10,939
<i>The water is wide</i>

1207
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:18,644
<i>I can't cross o'er
And neither have I wings to fly</i>

1208
02:10:19,087 --> 02:10:22,887
<i>Give me a boat
That can carry two</i>

1209
02:10:23,058 --> 02:10:25,925
<i>Both shall row
My love and I</i>

1210
02:10:26,094 --> 02:10:29,552
<i>For love is gentle
And love is kind</i>

1211
02:10:29,731 --> 02:10:32,723
<i>Sweetest flower
When first it's new</i>

1212
02:10:32,901 --> 02:10:36,496
<i>But love grows old
And waxes cold</i>

1213
02:10:36,671 --> 02:10:39,902
<i>And fades away
Like the morning dew</i>

1214
02:10:40,075 --> 02:10:43,101
<i>There is a ship
She sails the sea</i>

1215
02:10:43,278 --> 02:10:46,042
I guess I'll take my guns off...

1216
02:10:46,381 --> 02:10:48,372
...for fear the neighbors might spy them.

1217
02:11:21,683 --> 02:11:24,117
Don't that picture look dusty?

1218
02:13:06,221 --> 02:13:09,213
What have...? What have you done?

1219
02:13:11,660 --> 02:13:13,287
Jesse.

1220
02:13:18,833 --> 02:13:19,857
Jesse?

1221
02:13:21,002 --> 02:13:23,129
Jesse? Jesse?

1222
02:13:23,872 --> 02:13:25,737
Jesse!

1223
02:13:26,741 --> 02:13:28,834
No!

1224
02:13:33,014 --> 02:13:35,346
No. Jess...

1225
02:13:35,951 --> 02:13:40,354
Come back. Oh, come back.

1226
02:13:42,490 --> 02:13:46,654
Oh, Jesse! No!

1227
02:13:47,162 --> 02:13:51,064
Oh, Bob. Have you done this?!

1228
02:13:51,266 --> 02:13:53,632
I swear to God I didn't.

1229
02:13:54,636 --> 02:13:56,069
It was an accident, Zee.

1230
02:13:58,273 --> 02:14:01,640
Come on. Pistol went off accidentally.

1231
02:14:46,988 --> 02:14:48,182
Put my name.

1232
02:14:48,356 --> 02:14:50,824
Why, what'd you do? I shot him.

1233
02:14:58,033 --> 02:15:00,058
You might wanna keep that.

1234
02:15:38,006 --> 02:15:40,099
Thank you all very much.

1235
02:15:48,249 --> 02:15:50,740
<i>The resulting prints
sold for 2 dollars apiece...</i>

1236
02:15:50,919 --> 02:15:55,515
<i>...and were the models for the lithographed
covers on a number of magazines.</i>

1237
02:16:01,062 --> 02:16:06,261
<i>Soon a thousand strangers were making
spellbound pilgrimages to the cottage...</i>

1238
02:16:06,634 --> 02:16:11,162
<i>...or were venerating the iced remains
in Seidenfaden's cooling room.</i>

1239
02:16:12,073 --> 02:16:16,567
<i>The man who offered 30,000 dollars for
the body of President Garfield's assassin...</i>

1240
02:16:16,744 --> 02:16:20,646
<i>...sent a telegram to City Marshal
Enos Craig offering 50,000...</i>

1241
02:16:20,815 --> 02:16:23,113
<i>...for the body
of Jesse Woodson James...</i>

1242
02:16:23,284 --> 02:16:26,048
<i>...so that he could go around the country
with it...</i>

1243
02:16:28,456 --> 02:16:33,416
<i>...or at least sell it to P.T. Barnum
for his Greatest Show on Earth.</i>

1244
02:16:37,499 --> 02:16:40,593
<i>Another photograph was taken
of the renowned American bandit...</i>

1245
02:16:40,768 --> 02:16:43,362
<i>...nestled in his bed of ice.</i>

1246
02:16:43,538 --> 02:16:47,804
<i>And it was this shot that was most
available in sundries and apothecaries...</i>

1247
02:16:47,976 --> 02:16:51,639
<i>...to be viewed in a stereoscope
alongside the sphinx...</i>

1248
02:16:51,813 --> 02:16:55,806
<i>...the Taj Mahal,
and the catacombs of Rome.</i>

1249
02:17:21,009 --> 02:17:22,977
Hello, here!

1250
02:17:23,178 --> 02:17:25,772
"The arrest and confession
of Dick Liddil."

1251
02:17:25,947 --> 02:17:31,078
Young man, I thought you told me
you didn't know Dick had surrendered.

1252
02:17:31,252 --> 02:17:35,120
You mean he did? I didn't know.

1253
02:17:36,024 --> 02:17:37,924
But I knew I had not fooled him.

1254
02:17:38,092 --> 02:17:41,926
And he knew, as well as I, in that moment
that I intended to bring him to justice.

1255
02:17:42,864 --> 02:17:46,425
But he would not kill me
in the presence of his wife and children.

1256
02:17:46,601 --> 02:17:49,832
And so he was smiling
to throw me off-guard.

1257
02:17:53,074 --> 02:17:55,736
Well, it's all right, anyway, Bob.

1258
02:17:57,612 --> 02:18:00,513
<i>It was widely felt that
Bob possessed some acting talent...</i>

1259
02:18:00,682 --> 02:18:02,946
<i>...and Charley, not a jot.</i>

1260
02:18:03,117 --> 02:18:06,052
That picture's awful dusty.

1261
02:18:06,854 --> 02:18:09,982
<i>Charley was only expected
not to slouch or mutter...</i>

1262
02:18:10,158 --> 02:18:14,822
<i>...and to transport his sicknesses
to the alley before letting them go.</i>

1263
02:18:44,225 --> 02:18:46,090
And that's...

1264
02:18:46,661 --> 02:18:49,323
...how I killed Jesse James.

1265
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:56,327
<i>By October of 1883, Bob Ford
could be identified correctly...</i>

1266
02:18:56,504 --> 02:19:00,770
<i>...by more citizens than could
the president of the United States.</i>

1267
02:19:01,442 --> 02:19:06,175
<i>He was as renowned at 20 as Jesse was
after 14 years of grand larceny.</i>

1268
02:19:06,347 --> 02:19:08,542
You won't get your hooks into me.

1269
02:19:09,083 --> 02:19:13,816
That's right. That's right.
Sit next to your boyfriend. Jezebel.

1270
02:19:13,988 --> 02:19:16,081
<i>Charley was increasingly superstitious...</i>

1271
02:19:16,257 --> 02:19:18,953
<i>...increasingly subject
to the advice of soothsayers...</i>

1272
02:19:19,127 --> 02:19:23,154
<i>...who promised to cure his miseries
with pipe smoke and poultices.</i>

1273
02:19:23,331 --> 02:19:26,596
You been spending too much time
with Gypsies, Charley.

1274
02:19:32,307 --> 02:19:33,672
Shit.

1275
02:19:38,012 --> 02:19:40,572
The picture's awful dusty.

1276
02:19:41,015 --> 02:19:44,849
<i>Something began to change
in Charley's stage portrayal of Jesse.</i>

1277
02:19:45,019 --> 02:19:47,544
<i>His gait seemed more practiced.</i>

1278
02:19:47,722 --> 02:19:51,021
<i>His voice was spookily similar
to the man's.</i>

1279
02:19:51,192 --> 02:19:53,592
<i>His newly suggested dialogue
was analogous...</i>

1280
02:19:53,761 --> 02:19:56,787
<i>...to a script Jesse might have originated.</i>

1281
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:02,034
<i>He began to look at his younger brother
with spite...</i>

1282
02:20:02,203 --> 02:20:04,831
<i>...as if he suspected that
in some future performance...</i>

1283
02:20:05,006 --> 02:20:09,534
<i>...he might present himself
to a live cartridge in Robert Ford's gun.</i>

1284
02:20:10,878 --> 02:20:12,709
Murderer!

1285
02:20:13,047 --> 02:20:14,776
Cur!

1286
02:20:15,416 --> 02:20:17,179
Coward!

1287
02:20:20,722 --> 02:20:25,250
You wanna investigate my courage?
Do you?

1288
02:20:25,660 --> 02:20:29,426
Find out! Find out!

1289
02:20:34,068 --> 02:20:35,933
Nobody.

1290
02:20:50,518 --> 02:20:52,315
Coward!

1291
02:21:17,512 --> 02:21:23,075
<i>By his own approximation, Bob
assassinated Jesse James over 800 times.</i>

1292
02:21:23,251 --> 02:21:27,017
<i>He suspected no one in history
had ever so often or so publicly...</i>

1293
02:21:27,188 --> 02:21:30,385
<i>...recapitulated an act of betrayal.</i>

1294
02:21:35,596 --> 02:21:38,360
<i>Bob always challenged
the allegations of cowardice...</i>

1295
02:21:38,533 --> 02:21:41,468
<i>...but Charley seemed
to agree with them.</i>

1296
02:21:41,736 --> 02:21:45,502
<i>He spoke of Mrs. Zee James
as certain priests might the Madonna...</i>

1297
02:21:45,673 --> 02:21:48,767
<i>...and composed long soul-describing letters
to her...</i>

1298
02:21:48,943 --> 02:21:51,138
<i>...begging her forgiveness...</i>

1299
02:21:52,447 --> 02:21:55,041
<i>...none of which he mailed.</i>

1300
02:22:22,910 --> 02:22:28,507
<i>Charley Ford became all that his countrymen
wanted an assassin of Jesse James to be.</i>

1301
02:22:32,787 --> 02:22:38,657
<i>Jesse James was a man
Who killed many men</i>

1302
02:22:39,861 --> 02:22:44,298
<i>He robbed the Glendale train</i>

1303
02:22:44,532 --> 02:22:50,368
<i>And he stole from the rich
And he gave to the poor</i>

1304
02:22:50,605 --> 02:22:55,542
<i>He had a hand
And a heart and a brain</i>

1305
02:22:56,344 --> 02:23:01,839
<i>Well, Jesse had a wife
To mourn for his life</i>

1306
02:23:02,016 --> 02:23:07,113
<i>Three children
They were brave</i>

1307
02:23:07,288 --> 02:23:12,885
<i>But that dirty little coward
Who shot Mr. Howard</i>

1308
02:23:13,127 --> 02:23:18,190
<i>Has laid Jesse James in his grave</i>

1309
02:23:19,267 --> 02:23:24,261
<i>It was Robert Ford
That dirty little coward</i>

1310
02:23:25,006 --> 02:23:29,409
<i>I wonder how does he feel</i>

1311
02:23:29,577 --> 02:23:35,311
<i>For he ate at Jesse's bread
And he slept in Jesse's bed</i>

1312
02:23:35,483 --> 02:23:40,511
<i>And he laid poor Jesse in his grave</i>

1313
02:23:40,988 --> 02:23:46,517
<i>Well, Jesse had a wife
To mourn for his life</i>

1314
02:23:46,694 --> 02:23:51,597
<i>Three children
They were brave</i>

1315
02:23:51,766 --> 02:23:57,398
<i>But that dirty little coward
Who shot Mr. Howard</i>

1316
02:23:57,572 --> 02:24:01,736
<i>Has laid poor Jesse in his grave</i>

1317
02:24:13,287 --> 02:24:15,312
I'm Robert Ford.

1318
02:24:26,033 --> 02:24:29,764
It was two children, not three.

1319
02:24:41,148 --> 02:24:42,479
Hey.

1320
02:24:43,384 --> 02:24:45,944
You get yourself home, son, okay?

1321
02:24:46,654 --> 02:24:50,681
Come on. Get out of here.
Get out of my place.

1322
02:25:22,456 --> 02:25:24,651
<i>He thought, at his angriest...</i>

1323
02:25:24,825 --> 02:25:28,591
<i>...about visiting the kin
of Jesse's slaughtered victims:</i>

1324
02:25:30,564 --> 02:25:33,829
<i>Mrs. William Westfall in Plattsburg...</i>

1325
02:25:36,337 --> 02:25:39,431
<i>...the Wymore family in Clay County...</i>

1326
02:25:44,578 --> 02:25:48,878
<i>...perhaps even Mrs. Joseph Heywood
in Northfield, Minnesota.</i>

1327
02:25:51,952 --> 02:25:54,944
<i>He would go to their homes
and give his name as Robert Ford...</i>

1328
02:25:55,122 --> 02:25:58,091
<i>...the man who killed Jesse James.</i>

1329
02:25:59,527 --> 02:26:02,587
<i>He imagined they would
be grateful to him.</i>

1330
02:26:53,547 --> 02:26:58,541
<i>It was only with Dorothy Evans
that Bob spoke revealingly or plainly...</i>

1331
02:26:58,719 --> 02:27:03,156
<i>...and it was with her that he spoke of
things he didn't know he knew.</i>

1332
02:27:24,812 --> 02:27:28,873
<i>He told her that he had no real memory
of the shooting and its aftermath.</i>

1333
02:27:29,049 --> 02:27:32,917
<i>He could remember lifting the gun
that Jesse had given him...</i>

1334
02:27:33,654 --> 02:27:37,681
<i>...and then it was Good Friday and he was
reading about the funeral proceedings...</i>

1335
02:27:37,858 --> 02:27:40,383
<i>...as if they'd happened a long time ago.</i>

1336
02:27:41,962 --> 02:27:44,089
Why did you kill him?

1337
02:27:48,402 --> 02:27:50,427
Well, he was gonna kill me.

1338
02:27:55,643 --> 02:27:58,874
So you were scared
and that's the only reason?

1339
02:28:01,615 --> 02:28:03,014
Yeah.

1340
02:28:03,484 --> 02:28:05,543
And the reward money.

1341
02:28:11,358 --> 02:28:14,156
Do you want me to change the subject?

1342
02:28:22,369 --> 02:28:24,701
You know what I expected?

1343
02:28:25,739 --> 02:28:27,730
Applause.

1344
02:28:30,311 --> 02:28:34,475
I was only 20 years old then.
I couldn't see how it would look to people.

1345
02:28:38,586 --> 02:28:41,248
I was surprised by what happened.

1346
02:28:42,323 --> 02:28:44,291
They didn't applaud.

1347
02:28:47,728 --> 02:28:49,593
<i>He was ashamed of his boasting...</i>

1348
02:28:49,763 --> 02:28:52,630
<i>...his pretensions of courage
and ruthlessness.</i>

1349
02:28:52,933 --> 02:28:56,699
<i>He was sorry about his cold-bloodedness,
his dispassion...</i>

1350
02:28:58,339 --> 02:29:02,742
<i>...his inability to express
what he now believed was the case:</i>

1351
02:29:05,312 --> 02:29:08,338
<i>That he truly regretted killing Jesse...</i>

1352
02:29:09,116 --> 02:29:12,108
<i>...that he missed the man
as much as anybody...</i>

1353
02:29:12,653 --> 02:29:15,781
<i>...and wished his murder
hadn't been necessary.</i>

1354
02:29:35,242 --> 02:29:37,335
<i>Even as he circulated his saloon...</i>

1355
02:29:37,511 --> 02:29:41,277
<i>...he knew that the smiles disappeared
when he passed by.</i>

1356
02:29:42,383 --> 02:29:44,214
<i>He received so many menacing letters...</i>

1357
02:29:44,385 --> 02:29:47,821
<i>...that he could read them
without any reaction except curiosity.</i>

1358
02:29:51,625 --> 02:29:56,426
<i>He kept to his apartment all day,
flipping over playing cards...</i>

1359
02:29:57,932 --> 02:30:02,426
<i>...looking at his destiny
in every king and jack.</i>

1360
02:30:06,640 --> 02:30:10,940
<i>Edward O'Kelly came up from Bachelor
at 1 p.m. on the 8th.</i>

1361
02:30:12,413 --> 02:30:16,349
<i>He had no grand scheme, no strategy...</i>

1362
02:30:16,517 --> 02:30:18,917
<i>...no agreement with higher authorities...</i>

1363
02:30:19,086 --> 02:30:21,850
<i>...nothing beyond
a vague longing for glory...</i>

1364
02:30:22,923 --> 02:30:27,189
<i>...and a generalized wish
for revenge against Robert Ford.</i>

1365
02:30:34,969 --> 02:30:38,234
- How'd it go last night?
- Not so bad.

1366
02:30:41,475 --> 02:30:42,874
The other one.

1367
02:30:45,379 --> 02:30:48,143
<i>Edward O'Kelly would be ordered
to serve a life sentence...</i>

1368
02:30:48,315 --> 02:30:51,216
<i>...in the Colorado Penitentiary
for second-degree murder.</i>

1369
02:30:51,385 --> 02:30:54,149
<i>Over 7000 signatures
would eventually be gathered...</i>

1370
02:30:54,321 --> 02:30:56,585
<i>...on a petition asking for
O'Kelly's release...</i>

1371
02:30:56,757 --> 02:31:01,751
<i>...and in 1902, Governor James B. Orman
would pardon the man.</i>

1372
02:31:02,363 --> 02:31:06,766
You shouldn't be wearing that stickpin
again there, Bob. Opals are unlucky.

1373
02:31:08,202 --> 02:31:12,400
My luck's not very good as it is. I don't
think an opal's gonna change that much.

1374
02:31:13,340 --> 02:31:14,773
I hear you.

1375
02:31:28,355 --> 02:31:30,220
<i>There would be no eulogies for Bob...</i>

1376
02:31:31,925 --> 02:31:36,021
<i>...no photographs of his body
would be sold in sundries stores...</i>

1377
02:31:36,730 --> 02:31:41,099
<i>...no people would crowd the streets
in the rain to see his funeral cortege...</i>

1378
02:31:42,836 --> 02:31:45,805
<i>...no biographies would be written
about him...</i>

1379
02:31:45,973 --> 02:31:48,533
<i>...no children named after him.</i>

1380
02:31:50,110 --> 02:31:54,843
<i>No one would ever pay 25 cents
to stand in the rooms he grew up in.</i>

1381
02:31:59,386 --> 02:32:01,115
Hello, Bob.

1382
02:32:02,556 --> 02:32:06,754
<i>The shotgun would ignite,
and Ella Mae would scream...</i>

1383
02:32:07,561 --> 02:32:11,224
<i>...but Robert Ford would only lay
on the floor and look at the ceiling...</i>

1384
02:32:11,398 --> 02:32:13,889
<i>...the light going out of his eyes...</i>

1385
02:32:14,068 --> 02:32:16,798
<i>...before he could find the right words.</i>
