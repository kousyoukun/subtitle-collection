00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,760
MAN 1 [ON TV]: Spring training camp and
he's definitely got the inside track.

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,520
Word is that they're having
some problems with injuries.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,240
MAN 2:
Really? Are they looking into...

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,760
...free-agent signings last second,
anything like that?

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,240
MAN 1: Possibly, and they've got
a strong farm club too.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,280
They've got some triple-A ballplayers
they might bring up.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,080
Peter would certainly be able
to tell us more about that.

8

9

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,360
They've got a strong ball club, as usual.
That's in the American.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,120
And in the National,
I'm still liking Chicago...

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,760
...with a little bit of a twist here
for Los Angeles.

13

New York-Chicago World Series...

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,560

15

16

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,360
The world of medicine
has seen its share of miracle cures...

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,160
...from the polio vaccine
to heart transplants...

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,440
...but all past achievements may pale in
comparison to the work of Dr. Alice Krippin.

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,440
Thank you for joining us this morning.

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,440
- Not at all.
- So, Dr. Krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.

24
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,320
Well, the premise is quite simple.

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,840
Take something designed by nature
and reprogram it...

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,320
...to make it work for the body
rather than against it.

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,120
- We're talking about a virus?
- Yes.

28
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,080
In this case, the measles virus...

29
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,440
...which has been engineered at a genetic
level to be helpful rather than harmful.

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,920
Um, I'm not... I find the best way
to describe it is...

31
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,560
...if you can imagine your body
as a highway...

32
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,600
...and you picture the virus as a very fast
car being driven by a very bad man...

33
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,800
...imagine the damage that
that car could cause.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,280
But then if you replace that man
with a cop...

35
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,800
...the picture changes. And that's
essentially what we've done.

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,240
Now, how many people
have you treated so far?

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,040
Well, we've had 10,009 clinical trials
in humans so far.

38
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,960
- And how many are cancer-free?
- Ten thousand and nine.

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,280
So you have actually cured cancer?

40
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,120
Yes, yes. Yes, we have.

41
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,880

42
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,120

Good morning, Matt.
It's looking great, I'll tell you.

Not only was this the biggest
snowstorm in New York City history...

47
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,120
...it had to be one of the prettiest.
Imagine waking up on Sunday...

48
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,600

in New York City.

planes, trains and automobiles.

54

There was a report, a Turkish Airlines
flight skidded off the runway at JFK.

beautiful for the next day, at least.

00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,760
Let's go.

167
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,120
Wait.

168
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,920
ROBERT [ON RECORDING]:
My name is Robert Neville.

169
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,760
I am a survivor living in New York City.

170
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,520
I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.

171
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,120
I will be at the South Street Seaport
every day at midday...

172
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,320
...when the sun is highest in the sky.

173
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,320
If you are out there...

174
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,160
If anyone is out there...

175
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,600
I can provide food.

176
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,480
I can provide shelter.

177
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,440
I can provide security.

178
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,040
If there's anybody out there...

179
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,000
...anybody...

180
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,320
Please.

181
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,240
You are not alone.

182
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,600
Fore!

183
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,160
Yeah.

184
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,680
Keep your eye on this one for me.

185
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,200
Ooh.

186
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,800
I'm getting good.

187
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,840
Ss-ss.

188
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,240
Sam! No, no, no!

189
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,760
No! No! Sam!

190
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,640
No! No!

191
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,200
Sam? Sam? Sam?

192
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,920
Sam? Sam?

193
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,320
Sam? Sam?

194
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Hello, Sam?

195
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,320
Sam?

196
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,280
Sam?

197
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,080
Come on. Sam.

198
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,560
I gotta go, Sam.

199
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,880
I gotta go. I gotta go.

200
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,440
Sam?

201
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,000
Sam? Sam?

202
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,680
Sam? Sam?

203
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,760
Sam. Sam.

204
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,560
Sam. Sam, come on, we gotta go.
Sam.

205
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,120
What are you doing?

206
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,480
Sam, we gotta go!

207
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,200
Sam, go! Go!

208
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,720
Sam, get out! Get out!

209
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,560
You gotta pay attention, okay?
You gotta pay attention.

210
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,360
Listen, uh...

211
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,440
...I want you to stay here
on this one, okay?

212
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,600
Because you can still get infected.

213
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,200
And I can't.

214
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,160
So, look, if I'm not back by dark...

215
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,280
...just go.

216
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,800
Okay. Subject is female.
Likely 18 to 20 years of age.

217
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,320
Dilaudid push only sedates effectively
at six times human dose.

218
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,360
Core temperature, 106 Fahrenheit.
Pulse, 200 bpm.

219
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,640
Respiration elevated.

220
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,680
PA 02, 300 percent of normal.

221
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,520
Pupils fully dilated.

222
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,000
Nonreactive to light.

223
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,840
Extreme reaction to UV exposure.

224
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:23,720
Symptoms and tissue samples
confirm subject is infected with KV.

225
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,680
Vaccine test.

226
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,160
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6.

227
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,480
Commencing human trials.

228
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,400
Respiration slowing.

229
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,600
Pulse, 190. Core temperature...

230
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,280
...105...

231
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,960
...104 and decreasing.

232
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,040
We may have something here.

233
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,680
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6
ineffective on humans.

234
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:30,000
Test results linked to this entry
saved on six redundant drives.

235
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
Still no cure.

236
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,560
ROBERT:
Day 1001.

237
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,880
We came in close contact
with a hive today.

238
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,800
Blood tests confirm that
I remain immune to both the airborne...

239
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,720
...and contact strains.

240
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,760
Canines remain immune
to airborne strain only.

241
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,080
You can't go running
into the dark, dummy.

242
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,920
Vaccine trials continue.

243
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:20,120
I'm still unable to transfer my immunity
to infected hosts.

244
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,560
The Krippin Virus is...

245
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,720
...elegant.

246
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,920
Just fishing in the dark, son.

247
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,800
Mm. A behavioral note, um:

248
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,280
An infected male
exposed himself to sunlight today.

249
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,280
Now, it's possible
decreased brain function...

250
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,520
...or the growing scarcity of food
is causing them to...

251
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,640
...ignore their basic survival instincts.

252
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,000
Social de-evolution appears complete.

253
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,480
Typical human behavior
is now entirely absent.

254
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,840
Why are we stopping?

255
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,320
The street's closed, folks. We hoof it.

256
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,760
- We got less than 10 minutes.
- Baby, give me the dog.

257
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,400
- Come on, baby. Let's go. Let's go.
MARLEY: Daddy!

258
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,880
It's all right. It's all right. Come on.

259
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,720
MIKE: Keep the colonel and his family
between us and don't let anyone stop you.

260
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,280
MARLEY:
Mommy, they have guns!

261
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,440
It's okay. They're in the Army like Daddy.

262
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,720

MAN 2: Clear. Good, go on.

278
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,680
I'm not infected.

279
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,280
Please! Please!

280
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,200

Get your hands off.

284
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,120

- Scan her again. Stand down!

289
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,080
Stand down, soldier! Stand down!

290
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,840
I am Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville.
I am ordering you to scan her again.

291
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,720
Scan her again!

292
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,320
All right, scan her again.

293
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,120
- It's clear.
- It's clear. Move through.

294
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,640
Who's next? Come on.

295
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,720

MAN 4:
Stay away from the shoreline.

00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,880
How long?

300
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,320
Five minutes. We'll make it.

301
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,640
This is Ranger 621, we're on site.

302
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,400
Military quarantine is about to begin.

303
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:46,480

You got my word on it.

Give me a kiss.

I love you. I love you.

00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,680
Dear Lord, please watch over Robert...

307
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,200
...and keep him strong
through the struggles ahead.

308
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:16,400
Lord, please just bring him home safely.
Amen.

309
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,400
Daddy's gonna make the monsters
go away, baby, okay?

310
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,880
Sam, you protect Daddy.

311
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,000
- No, baby, I can't. Daddy can't take a dog.
MAN 7: Sir, we gotta go!

312
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,120
Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.

313
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,000
[MOUTHS]
It's a butterfly.

314

How'd you sleep?

317
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,640
Dr. Neville will be taking a closer look
at the ongoing mutations...

318
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,720
...of Dr. Alice Krippin's once-hailed
miracle cure for cancer.

319
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,000
So far, almost 5000 patients
treated with her retrofitted virus...

320
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,000
...have begun exhibiting symptoms
resembling the early onset of rabies.

321
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,000
Twenty-five patients have already died.

322
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,360
Dr. Neville has ordered local hospitals
to stockpile antiviral drugs...

323
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,480
...and to begin
preliminary quarantine protocols.

324
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,200
It's my birthday.

325
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,720
We are fully confident Dr. Neville
can see us through these...

I'm not gonna let this happen.

513
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,400
I can still fix this.

- Sorry.

515
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,360
I called down twice.

516
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,200
Oh. Oh, thank you.

517
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,480
It's heavily sedated.
Don't worry, it's safe.

518
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:14,400
I've never seen one so still.

They're always biting.

520
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:24,040
You think that can cure her?

521
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,160
Um... No, this will
almost certainly kill it...

522
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,560
...but it's possible by drastically reducing
the body temperature...

523
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,720
...I can increase the compound's
effectiveness.

01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,080
Yes.

Where can Ethan sleep?

529
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,960
He's heavy.

530
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,280
Can you get that?

531
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,360
She's beautiful.

532
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,760
What's her name?

533
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,360
Marley.

534
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:20,200
- Her name was Marley.
- It's a beautiful name.

535
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:26,120
Yeah. We named her after Bob Marley.

536
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:29,640

- Uh, the singer.

01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,680
Uh, his father.

539
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,240
His father.

540
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:43,440
Nope.

- Mm-mm.

547
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,600
Wow.

548
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:34,360
He had this idea,
it was kind of a virologist's idea.

549
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:39,160
He believed that you could cure
racism and hate. Literally cure it...

550
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:45,480
...by injecting music and love
into people's lives.

551
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:50,160
One day, he was scheduled
to perform at a peace rally.

552
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:54,320
Gunmen came to his house
and shot him down.

Somebody asked him why.

556
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,240
He said, "The people...

To the colony.

562
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,560
There's no colony, Anna.

563
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,360
Everything just fell apart.

564
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:11,240
- There was no evacuation plan...
- You're wrong. There is a colony.

I know, okay?

566
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:16,520
How do you know, Anna?

567
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,080
I just know.

568
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:30,520
How? I said, how do you know?
How could you know?

569
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,560
God told me.

570
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,040
He has a plan.

But something told me
to turn on the radio.

01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,080
Something told me to come here.

576
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:56,040
My voice on the radio
told you to come here, Anna.

577
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,240
You were trying to kill yourself
last night?

01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:02,720
I got here just in time to save your life.
That's a coincidence?

01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:06,560
- Just stop it. Stop it. Stop.
- He must have sent me here for a reason.

Neville, the world is quieter now.

582
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,960
You just have to listen.

01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,320
If we listen...

584
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,960
...we can hear God's plan.

- Yeah.

586
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:22,920
All right. Let me tell you
about your God's plan.

587
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:26,000
There were 6 billion people on Earth
when the infection hit.

588
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:30,760
KV had a 90 percent kill rate.
That's 5.4 billion...

589
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:33,400
...people dead.

590
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,400
Crashed and bled out, dead.

591
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,440
Less than 1 percent immunity.

592
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:42,400
That left 12 million healthy people
like you, me and Ethan.

593
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:46,720
The other 588 million...

594
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,880
...turned into your Darkseekers.

595
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,760
And then they got hungry.

596
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:55,320
And they killed and fed on everybody.

597
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,600

01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:04,280

brought us home last night?

Come on. Come on.

ANNA: Yeah.

burned through our civilization...

...pushing humankind
