to heart transplants...

Thank you for joining us this morning.

-Not at all.
-So, Dr. Krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.

24
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,600
Well, the premise is quite simple.

25
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,100
Take something designed by nature
and reprogram it...

26
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,600
...to make it work for the body
rather than against it.

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,400
-We're talking about a virus?
-Yes.

28
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,400
ln this case, the measles virus...

29
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,700
...which has been engineered at a genetic
level to be helpful rather than harmful.

30
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,200
Um, l'm not-- l find the best way
to describe it is...

31
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,800
...if you can imagine your body
as a highway...

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,900
...and you picture the virus as a very fast
car being driven by a very bad man...

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,100
...imagine the damage that
that car could cause.

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,500
But then if you replace that man
with a cop...

35
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,000
...the picture changes. And that's
essentially what we've done.

36
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,500
Now, how many people
have you treated so far?

37
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,300
