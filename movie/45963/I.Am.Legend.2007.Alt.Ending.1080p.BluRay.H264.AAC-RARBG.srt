00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>--Spring training camp and
he's definitely got the inside track.</i>

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,354
<i>Word is that they're having
some problems with injuries.</i>

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,079
<i>Really? Are they looking into...</i>

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,590
<i>...free-agent signings last second,
anything like that?</i>

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,115
<i>Possibly, and they've got</i>
a <i>strong farm club too.</i>

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,113
<i>They've got some triple-a ballplayers
they might bring up.</i>

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,954
<i>Peter would certainly be able
to tell us more about that.</i>

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,440
<i>Who do you like?</i>

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,955
<i>So far,
i like what I'm seeing in New York.</i>

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,192
<i>They've got a strong ball club, as usual.
That's in the American.</i>

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,954
<i>And in the national,
I'm still liking Chicago...</i>

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,555
<i>...with a little bit of a twist here
for Los Angeles.</i>

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,639
<i>Okay, so we're looking at
New York-Chicago world series...</i>

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,360
- ...<i>possible Los Angeles.
- Could be</i> a <i>dark horse.</i>

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,471
<i>Hold him to it
at the end of the season.</i>

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,756
<i>That's gonna do it for us
from the sports desk.</i>

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,799
<i>- Back to the studio. Thanks, Dave.
<i>- Thanks for nothing, Eddie.</i>

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,591
<i>Thank you, guys. That's not all we're
following. Here's Karen at the health desk.</i>

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,193
The world of medicine
has seen its share of miracle cures...

20
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,954
...from the polio vaccine
to heart transplants...

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,280
...but all past achievements may pale in
comparison to the work of Dr. Alice krippin.

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,272
Thank you for joining us this morning.

23
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,276
- Not at all.
- So, Dr. krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,159
Well, the premise is quite simple.

25
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,676
Take something designed by nature
and reprogram it...

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,151
...to make it work for the body
rather than against it.

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,958
- We're talking about a virus?
- Yes.

28
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,918
In this case, the measles virus...

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,280
...which has been engineered at a genetic
level to be helpful rather than harmful.

30
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,717
Um, I'm not-- I find the best way
to describe it is...

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,394
...if you can imagine your body
as a highway...

32
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,430
...and you picture the virus as a very fast
car being driven by a very bad man...

33
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,638
...imagine the damage that
that car could cause.

34
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,111
But then if you replace that man
with a cop...

35
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,591
...the picture changes. And that's
essentially what we've done.

36
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,076
Now, how many people
have you treated so far?

37
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,870
Well, we've had 10,009 clinical trials
in humans so far.

38
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,795
- And how many are cancer-free?
- Ten thousand and nine.

39
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,078
So you have actually cured cancer?

40
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,915
Yes, yes. Yes, we have.

41
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,717
What you see? What you see?

42
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,959
Damn.

43
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,115
Let's go, Sam.

44
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,553
Come on.

45
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,880
<i>Good morning, Matt.
Lt's looking great, I'll tell you.</i>

46
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,396
<i>Not only was this the biggest
snowstorm in New York City history...</i>

47
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,956
<i>...it had to be one of the prettiest.
Imagine waking up on Sunday...</i>

48
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,431
<i>...to 26.9 inches of snow
in New York City.</i>

49
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,876
Here you go. Just the way you like it.

50
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,111
Disgusting.

51
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,554
Excuse me, excuse me.

52
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,632
All right. Come on, relax.

53
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,117
<i>However, it did strand
planes, trains and automobiles.</i>

54
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,513
<i>There was a report, a turkish airlines
flight skidded off the runway at jfk.</i>

55
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,479
<i>No one was injured,
but for the most part, Matt...</i>

56
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,631
There you go.

57
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,196
<i>I'm gonna show you, attempting
the Bob hager rule of thumb here.</i>

58
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,876
<i>And I'm gonna plug my ruler in.</i>

59
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,955
<i>In New York, in 30 rock,
we have 16 inches of snow, Matt.</i>

60
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,519
<i>Back to you, Matt and Katie.</i>

61
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,072
<i>Gosh. All right, it looks great. It'll be
beautiful for the next day, at least.</i>

62
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,117
<i>- And then it turns brown.
- If that.</i>

63
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,833
<i>Anyway, Ann, thanks so much.</i>

64
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,516
Mm-mm. No, no, no. Eat your vegetables.

65
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,752
Don't just push them around, eat them.
I'm not playing.

66
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,389
<i>Woman". Good morning. This morning,
all up the east coast...</i>

67
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,440
Okay. You gonna eat your vegetables.
We will sit down here all night.

68
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,513
<i>The biggest challenge
is getting back to work.</i>

69
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,955
What are you whining about?
Why didn't you just eat your vegetables?

70
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,910
Hey. All right, here's the deal.
Look. Look.

71
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,869
You're gonna eat twice as many vegetables
tomorrow night. All right?

72
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,032
Deal? Deal?

73
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,393
Come on.

74
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,391
Don't <i>worry</i> about a <i>thing</i>

75
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,593
<i>'cause every little thing
gonna be all right</i>

76
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,996
I know that feels good.

77
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,673
<i>Smiled with the rising sun
three little birds</i>

78
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,076
ah, Sam.

79
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,073
<i>Singin' sweet songs
of melody--</i>

80
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,113
I'm all right.

81
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,237
I'm all right, it's all right.

82
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,351
What's happening? I tried to reach you
on your cell. I get a recording.

83
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,278
- Cell service is down.
- Where are we going?

84
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,034
- Can't get used to the new regs.
- Going to aunt Sara's.

85
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,909
- Ma! No! Why?
- Baby, just strap yourself in. Go.

86
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,072
- We're at 30 minutes, colonel.
- Copy.

87
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,991
- Thirty minutes to what?
- They're sealing off the island.

88
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,116
- Seal off the island? This island?
- But I don't wanna go to aunt Sara's.

89
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,112
- Did you bring all the money?
- Yeah.

90
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,600
- How much?
- Six hundred.

91
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,080
Why did you say, "you're going"?

92
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,560
- That's not enough.
- Robert.

93
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,677
You said, "you're going,"
not, "we're going."

94
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,760
When you get across, I need you to get
to the atm. Get as much cash as you can.

95
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,719
Take Sara's car, go upstate.
I'll meet you at the farm.

96
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,951
Bring enough food for two weeks.

97
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,680
Jesus, Robert, did it jump?

98
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,558
Is it airborne?

99
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,678
But we only go to aunt Sara's
in the summer.

100
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,638
- It may be.
- Oh, my god.

101
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,555
-It's Christmas. What about my presents?
- He's announcing it.

102
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,075
<i>Make no mistake, Americans, this virus--</i>

103
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,191
you left my Christmas presents
in the closet.

104
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,350
Hush now, mar.

105
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,275
<i>--Threatens the survival of not only our
nation, but of every other nation--</i>

- Marley, enough!

107
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,437
<i>And so it is with great sadness,
but even greater resolve...</i>

108
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,433

110

<i>God be with us.</i>

111
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,191
<i>This has been a special--</i>

112
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,910
the window is still open. We find
something in a week or two weeks...

113
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,596
...we can reverse the spread.

114
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,956
I can still fix this.

115
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,919
Please. You can do the same work
outside the city.

116
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,919
This is ground zero. This is my site.
We talked about this.

117
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,713
What are you doing?

118
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,116
What am I doing?

119
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,472
I'm not gonna let this happen.

120
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,478
Let? This isn't up to you.
You can't control--

121
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,553
ah! Daddy, it's a monster!

122
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,116
How'd you sleep?

123
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,393
Look out. Come on,
you know better than that.

124
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,029
Uh-uh.

00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,799

Animal trials. Streaming video.

128
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,479
Ga series results appear typical.

129
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,953
Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10...

130

Compound 6 appears to be showing
decreased aggression response.

Partial pigmentation return.

Good morning, Marge.
Good morning, Fred.

What are you guys doing here so early?

That's a nice sweatshirt there, Fred.
Don't set it down anywhere.

Okay, tomorrow.
I'm gonna say hello tomorrow.

Good job. You did so good.

<i>I am a survivor living in New York City.</i>

168
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,312
<i>I am broadcasting on all am frequencies.</i>

169
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,911
<i>I will be at the south street seaport
every day at midday...</i>

170
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,152
<i>...when the sun is highest in the sky.</i>

171
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,110
<i>If you are out there...</i>

172
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,956
<i>If anyone is out there...</i>

173
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,390
<i>I can provide food.</i>

174
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,315
<i>I can provide shelter.</i>

175
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,275
<i>I can provide security.</i>

176
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,914
<i>If there's anybody out there...</i>

177
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,832
<i>Anybody</i>

178
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,153
<i>please.</i>

179
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,071
You are not alone.

180
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,399
Fore!

181
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,957
Yeah.

182
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,474
Keep your eye on this one for me.

183
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,030
Ooh.

184
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,636
I'm getting good.

185
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,633
Ss-ss.

186
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,037
Sam! No, no, no!

187
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,589
No! No! Sam!

188
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,519
No! No!

189
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,000
Sam? Sam? Sam?

190
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,760
Sam? Sam?

191
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,155
Sam? Sam?

192
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,437
Hello, Sam?

193
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,159
Sam?

194
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,113
Sam?

195
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,910
Come on. Sam.

196
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,396
I gotta go, Sam.

197
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,712
I gotta go. I gotta go.

198
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,278
Sam?

199
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,789
Sam? Sam?

200
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,509
Sam? Sam?

201
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,593
Sam. Sam.

202
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,390
Sam. Sam, come on, we gotta go.
Sam.

203
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,912
What are you doing?

204
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,272
Sam, we gotta go!

205
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,029
Sam, go! Go!

206
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,555
Sam, get out! Get out!

207
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,359
You gotta pay attention, okay?
You gotta pay attention.

208
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,193
Listen, uh...

209
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,272
...l want you to stay here
on this one, okay?

210
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,394
Because you can still get infected.

211
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,032
And I can't.

212
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,998
So, look, if I'm not back by dark...

213
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,118
...just go.

214
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,679
Okay. Subject is female.
Likely 18 to 20 years of age.

215
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,152
Dilaudid push only sedates effectively
at six times human dose.

216
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,154
Core temperature, 106 fahrenheit.
Pulse, 200 bpm.

217
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,515
Respiration elevated.

218
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:52,514
Pa O2, 300 percent of normal.

219
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,355
Pupils fully dilated.

220
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,830
Nonreactive to light.

221
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,195
Extreme reaction to uv exposure.

222
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:42,032
Symptoms and tissue samples
confirm subject is infected with kv.

223
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,074
Vaccine test.

224
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,518
Ga series, serum 391, compound 6.

225
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,799
Commencing human trials.

226
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,754
Respiration slowing.

227
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,910
Pulse, 190. Core temperature...

228
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,637
...105...

229
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,314
...104 and decreasing.

230
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,393
We may have something here.

231
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:24,996
Ga series, serum 391, compound 6
ineffective on humans.

232
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,356
Test results linked to this entry
saved on six redundant drives.

233
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,511
Still no cure.

234
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,920
Day 1001.

235
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,198
<i>We came in close contact
with a hive today.</i>

236
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,115
<i>Blood tests confirm that
i remain immune to both the airborne...</i>

237
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,035
...and contact strains.

238
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,070
Canines remain immune
to airborne strain only.

239
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,431
You can't go running
into the dark, dummy.

240
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,234
Vaccine trials continue.

241
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,473
I'm still unable to transfer my immunity
to infected hosts.

242
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,917
The krippin virus is...

243
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,071
...elegant.

244
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,238
Just fishing in the dark, son.

245
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,114
Mm. A behavioral note, um:

246
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,637
An infected male
exposed himself to sunlight today.

247
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,591
Now, it's possible
decreased brain function...

248
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,880
...or the growing scarcity of food
is causing them to...

249
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,994
...ignore their basic survival instincts.

250
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,350
Social de-evolution appears complete.

251
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,795
Typical human behavior
is now entirely absent.

252
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,159
Why are we stopping?

253
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,677
The street's closed, folks. We hoof it.

254
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,117
- We got less than 10 minutes.
- Baby, give me the dog.

255
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,717
- Come on, baby. Let's go. Let's go.
- Daddy!

256
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,235
It's all right. It's all right. Come on.

257
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,071
Keep the colonel and his family
between us and don't let anyone stop you.

258
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,639
Mommy, they have guns!

259
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,837
It's okay. They're in the army like daddy.

260
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,071
<i>Unless</i> you have clearance...

261
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,631
<i>...you cannot pass the checkpoint.
Please return to your homes.</i>

262
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,196
Make a hole, make a hole!
Coming through!

263
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,831

You're clear. Move ahead.

You're clear.

268
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,350
All right, that's it, move up.

269
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,878
All right, step up.

270
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,630
You're clear. Next. Let's go.

271
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,314
No good.

272
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,518
<i>Military quarantine is about to begin.</i>

273
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,593
Come on, step back.

274
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,593
<i>- Military</i> quarantine <i>is</i> about to begin.
- Look, look, look.

275
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,717
- I'm not infected.
- Clear. Good, go on.

276
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,035
I'm not infected.

277
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,594
Please! Please!

278
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,509
- Please take my baby. Take my baby, please.
- You're gonna have to move back.

279
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,079
- No good.
- Follow me, ma'am.

280
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,596
What? No! Robert! Robert!

281
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,910
Get your hands off my wife.
Get your hands off.

282
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,469
- Mommy!
- Stand down.

283
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,675
Lieutenant--

284
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,514
- mommy!
- Scan her again. Get your hands off of her!

285
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,114
Get your hands off of my wife.

286
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,630
- Stand down!
- Scan her again. Stand down!

287
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,440
Stand down, soldier! Stand down!

288
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,195
I am lieutenant colonel Robert Neville.
I am ordering you to scan her again.

289
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,078
Scan her again!

290
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,637
All right, scan her again.

291
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,439
-It's clear.
-Lt's clear. Move through.

292
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,989
Who's next? Come on.

293
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,073
Take my baby with you!
Please! Please!

294
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,471
- Mommy!
- Please take my baby. Please!

295
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,635
Daddy, why can't the little girl come too?

296
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,390
<i>Stay away from the shoreline.</i>

297
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,233
How long?

298
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,631
Five minutes. We'll make it.

299
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,952
This is ranger 621, we're on site.

300
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,712
<i>Military quarantine is about to begin.</i>

301
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,835
I won't take my eyes off them, colonel.
You got my word on it.

302
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,313
Give me a kiss.

303
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,474
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

304
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,033
Dear lord, please watch over Robert...

305
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,510
...and keep him strong
through the struggles ahead.

306
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,719
Lord, please just bring him home safely.
Amen.

307
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,749
Daddy's gonna make the monsters
go away, baby, okay?

308
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,196
Sam, you protect daddy.

309
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,354
- No, baby, I can't. Daddy can't take a dog.
- Sir, we gotta go!

310
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,471
Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.

311
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,390
<i>It's</i> a <i>butterfly.</i>

312
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,917
All right, come on, let's go!

313
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,673
How'd you sleep?

314
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,958
<i>Dr. Neville will be taking a closer look
at the ongoing mutations...</i>

315
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,075
...of <i>Dr. Alice krippin's once-hailed
miracle cure for cancer.</i>

316
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,359
<i>So far, almost 5000 patients
treated with her retrofitted virus...</i>

317
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,354
<i>...have begun exhibiting symptoms
resembling the early onset of rabies.</i>

318
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,319
<i>Twenty-five patients have already died.</i>

319
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,713
<i>Dr. Neville has ordered local hospitals
to stockpile antiviral drugs...</i>

320
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,793
<i>...and to begin
preliminary quarantine protocols.</i>

321
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,553
It's my birthday.

322
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,076
<i>We are fully confident Dr. Neville
can see us through these--</i>

323
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,958

324
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,315
My name <i>is</i> Robert Neville.

<i>If you are out there,

You are not alone.

335
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,593
Listen, uh...

336
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,151
...if you're planning a party or something,
just tell me now.

337
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,193
Okay? Because you know
i don't like surprises.

338
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,990
And I swear I'll act surprised. Okay?

339
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,712
Hey! Hey!

340
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,952
What the hell
are you doing out here, Fred?!

341
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,672
What the--? What the hell are you--?
No!

342
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,555
No! No!

343
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,080
No.

344
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,073
What the hell
are you doing out here, Fred?!

345
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,756
How did you get out here?!

346
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,072
Fred, if you're real,
you better tell me right now!

347
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,671
If you're real,
you better tell me right now!

348
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,790
Damn it, Fred!

349
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,311
Damn it!

350
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,236
I'm all right. I'm all right, I'm all right.

351
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,919
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.

352
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,920
Baby. I'm okay.

353
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,992
I'm okay. I'm okay.

354
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,358
Let's go.

355
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,518
Eh, eh! Come on. Sam, come on.

356
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,069
Let's go! Sam!

357
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,072
No! No! Let's go!

358
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,993
We gotta go home, Sam. Let's go!

359
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,239
Sam!

360
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,477
No!

361
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,589
Sam? Sam?

362
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,714
It's okay.

363
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,998
You're all right. Okay. It's okay.

364
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,629
You're all right. You're all right.

365
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,793
Samantha? Samantha, look at me, girl.

366
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:06,158
Hey. You're okay.
You're okay. Samantha.

367
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,472
We just gotta get you home.
Gotta get you-- gotta take you home.

368
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,240
Let me take you home.
All right, come here.

369
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,869
Come here. Come here. Come here.

370
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,359
Come on. Come here. Come here.

371
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,950
<i>L</i> got you. I got you.

372
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,712
It's okay.

373
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,352
You're okay.

374
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,152
Don't <i>worry</i>

375
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,476
<i>about a thing</i>

376
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:25,674
<i>'cause every little thing
ls gonna be all right</i>

377
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:34,792
<i>don't worry
about a thing</i>

378
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,035
<i>rise up this morning</i>

379
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,274
<i>smiled with the rising sun</i>

380
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,591
<i>three little birds</i>

381
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,275
I promised my friend...

382
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:07,074
...that I would say hello to you today.

383
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,478
Hello.

384
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,913
Hello.

385
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,199
Please say hello to me.

386
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,833
Please say hello to me.

387
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,913
Die!

388
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,270
Die!

389
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,038
Die!

390
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,356
Come on! Stay with me!

391
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,480
Where do you live?

392
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,197
Hey.

393
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,193
Hey!

394
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,510
Stay with me.

395
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,676
Where do you live?

396
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,200
Where do you live?

397
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,194
Uh...

398
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:35,558
11 Washington square.

399
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,799
They don't know where I live.

400
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:43,190
Don't-- don't let them track us.

401
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,160
You gotta stay out till dawn.

402
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:50,990
No!

403
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,511
Donkey?

404
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:56,595
<i>What are you doing?</i>

405
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:00,116
<i>I would think of all people you would
recognize a wall when you see one.</i>

406
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:05,036
<i>Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go
around my swamp, not through it.</i>

407
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,158
<i>Donkey". It is. Around your half, see?
That's your half, this is my half.</i>

408
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:11,915
<i>- Shrek". Oh, your half? Hm.
- Yes, my half.</i>

409
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:15,710
<i>I helped rescue the Princess. I did
half the work. I get half the Booty.</i>

410
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:19,236
<i>Now hand me that big old rock,
the one that looks like your head.</i>

411
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,550
<i>Shrek". Back off!
Donkey". No, you back off.</i>

412
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,791
<i>Shrek". This is my swamp!
Donkey". Our swamp.</i>

413
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,439
<i>- Smelly ogre.
Shrek". Fine!</i>

414
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,838
<i>Donkey". Come back,
I'm not through with you!</i>

415
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,513
<i>Well, I'm through with you.</i>

416
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,798
<i>Donkey". You know, with you
it's always "me, me, me."</i>

417
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:42,034
<i>Well, guess what, now it's my turn.
So you just shut up and pay attention!</i>

418
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:46,353
<i>You are mean to me! You insult me and
you don't appreciate anything that I do.</i>

419
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,955
<i>You're always pushing me around
or pushing me away.</i>

420
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:53,478
<i>Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad,
how come you came back?</i>

421
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:56,837
<i>Donkey". Because that's what friends do!
They forgive each other!</i>

422
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,873
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

423
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,350
<i>You're right, donkey. I forgive you...</i>

424
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,039
<i>...for stabbing me in the back!</i>

425
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,876
<i>Donkey". You're so wrapped up in layers,
you're afraid of your own feelings.</i>

426
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,189
- Go away.
- See?

427
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,550
<i>Doing it again,
just like you did to Fiona...</i>

428
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,870
<i>...and all she did was like you,
maybe love you.</i>

429
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:20,557
<i>Shrek". Love me? She said I was ugly,
a hideous creature.</i>

430
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,358
<i>I heard the two of you talking.</i>

431
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:27,356
<i>Donkey". She wasn't talking about you,
she was talking about somebody else.</i>

432
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,869
I'm afraid the eggs are powdered.

433
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:41,077
Obviously you know that.

434
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,115
They're yours.

435
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:48,275
But I did find bacon, which is about
the most fantastic thing in history.

436
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,235
And some antibiotics in the bathroom.

437
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,795
I put by your plate,
because your leg is okay...

438
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:59,193
...but it won't be for very long
if you don't start a course soon.

439
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,278
Who are you?

440
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,320
I'm Anna and that's Ethan.

441
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,516
Don't let it get cold.

442
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,199
It's okay. Go on.

443
01:07:56,360 --> 01:08:00,479
We came from Maryland.
We heard your message on the radio.

444
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,232
We were at the pier at noon.
We waited all day.

445
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,669
We're going to Vermont.

446
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,994
To the survivors' colony.

447
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,159
What?

448
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:18,750
In bethel. It's a safe zone.

449
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,389
There's no survivors' colony,
there's no safe zones.

450
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,437
Nothing happened
the way it was supposed to.

451
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,671
Nothing worked
the way it was supposed to.

452
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:30,437
In the mountains. There's a whole colony
of people there who didn't get sick.

453
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,160
The virus couldn't survive the cold.
There's a colony--

454
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,516
shut up! Shut up!

455
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,159
Everybody's dead.

456
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,431
Everybody is dead.

457
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,512
L just need--
i need a minute. Okay?

458
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,639
Just...

459
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,439
I just-- I was saving that bacon.

460
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,320
I was saving it.

461
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,595
I'm just-- I'm gonna go upstairs.
All right? Just--

462
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,797
I'm gonna go.

463
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:31,594
Ethan, put the knife down.

464
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,474
<i>- You there! Ogre.
- Aye.</i>

465
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,830
<i>Man".
By the order of lord farquaad...</i>

466
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,435
<i>...l am authorized
to place you both under arrest...</i>

467
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:21,391
<i>...and transport you
to a designated resettlement facility.</i>

468
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,918
<i>Oh, really? You and what army?</i>

469
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,873
Can I say something to you?

470
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,032
You was really, really something
back there. Incredible.

471
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,397
Are you talking to...

472
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,555
...me?

473
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,231
Yes, I was talking to you.
You was really great back there.

474
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:54,677
Those guards, they thought they was
all that. You showed up, and barn!

475
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,070
Tripping over themselves
like babes in the woods.

476
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,277
That really made me
feel good to see that.

477
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,676
That's great. Really.
Man, it's good to be free.

478
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:05,954
Now, why don't you go celebrate
your freedom with your own friends?

479
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,633
Hm?

480
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,234
But, uh...

481
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:10,993
...l don't have any friends.

482
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,669
And I'm not going out there by myself.

483
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,480
Wait a minute. I got a great idea.
I'll stick with you!

484
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,392
<i>Donkey".
You a mean, green fighting machine.</i>

485
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,678
<i>Together we'll scare the spit
out of anybody that crosses us.</i>

486
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,194
I like <i>Shrek.</i>

487
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,795
<i>Donkey". That was really scary.
If you don't mind me saying...</i>

488
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,713
<i>...if that don't work, your breath
will get the job done...</i>

489
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:35,794
<i>...because you definitely need some
tic tacs, because your breath stinks!</i>

490
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:40,433
<i>Man, you almost burned the hair
out of my nose. Just like the time...</i>

491
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,554
You're not so good with people anymore,
are you?

492
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,520
Thank you for my leg.

493
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,758
Okay.

494
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,399
Where have you been?

495
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:06,195
I was on a red cross evacuation ship
out of Sao Paulo.

496
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:09,432
Those boats
weren't meant to be permanent.

497
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,193
No, they weren't.

498
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,352
When the Navy fell apart,
we started docking to take on supplies.

499
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:18,275
Someone picked it up on shore.
Five of us were immune.

500
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,113
You said five?

501
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,155
The darkseekers got them.

502
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,154
You are the Robert Neville, aren't you?

503
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,394
It's too late today.

504
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,678
If we leave tomorrow at dawn, we can
make it to Vermont in a straight shot.

505
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,309
- So if you had--
- I'm not leaving.

506
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,510
This is ground zero.

507
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,110
This is my site.

508
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,269
I'm not gonna let this happen.

509
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,750
I can still fix this.

510
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,517
What happened to your leg?

511
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,119
That's my snare.
These are my materials.

512
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:16,312
The infected didn't do this. They can't.

513
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:20,151
- How do you know?
- They have no higher brain function.

514
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:25,599
They don't plan or hate.
They don't love. They can't.

515
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,833
Could they be evolving?

516
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,077
Ethan.

517
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,791
Hey, Ethan.

518
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,349
It's cold.

519
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,155
We gotta go.

520
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:09,876
- I've been cooking the compounds.
- What?

521
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,429
Robert
lce.Lneedice.

522
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:25,596
- Whoa. You scared me.
- Sorry.

523
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,080
I called down twice.

524
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,914
Oh. Oh, thank you.

525
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:38,230
It's heavily sedated.
Don't worry, it's safe.

526
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,119
I've never seen one so still.

527
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:44,394
They're always biting.

528
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,710
You think that can cure her?

529
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,878
Um... no, this will
almost certainly kill it...

530
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:57,237
...but it's possible by drastically reducing
the body temperature...

531
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,392
...l can increase the compound's
effectiveness.

532
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,996
Did all of them die?

533
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,793
Yes.

534
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,871
My god.

535
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:25,429
God didn't do this, Anna, we did.

536
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,115
Where can Ethan sleep?

537
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,677
He's heavy.

538
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,952
Can you get that?

539
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,076
She's beautiful.

540
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,471
What's her name?

541
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,037
Marley.

542
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:46,876
- Her name was Marley.
-Lt's a beautiful name.

543
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,839
Yeah. We named her after Bob Marley.

544
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:56,351
- Who?
- Uh, the singer.

545
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,112
Damian?

546
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,397
Uh, his father.

547
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,950
His father.

548
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,155
Nope.

549
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,436
<i>I shot the sheriff</i>

550
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:18,712
<i>but I didn't shoot the deputy</i>

552
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:31,235
- Oh, that is unacceptable.
- What?

553
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,389
Best album ever made.

554
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,798
- You don't recognize that?
- Mm-mm.

555
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,309
Wow.

556
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:01,072
He had this idea,
it was kind of a virologist's idea.

557
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:05,877
He believed that you could cure
racism and hate. Literally cure it...

558
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:12,195
...by injecting music and love
into people's lives.

559
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:16,920
One day, he was scheduled
to perform at a peace rally.

560
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:21,039
Gunmen came to his house
and shot him down.

561
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,200
Two days later...

562
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:28,435
...he walked out on that stage and sang.

563
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,669
Somebody asked him why.

564
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,949
He said, "the people...

565
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:42,149
...who are trying to make this world worse
are not taking a day off.

566
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,351
How can I?"

567
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:51,273
Light up the darkness.

568
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,510
Come with us, Neville.

569
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,117
To the colony.

570
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,275
There's no colony, Anna.

571
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,119
Everything just fell apart.

572
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:37,989
- There was no evacuation plan--
- you're wrong. There is a colony.

573
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,557
I know, okay?

574
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,235
How do you know, Anna?

575
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:50,830
I just know.

576
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:57,199
How? I said, how do you know?
How could you know?

577
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,240
God told me.

578
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,751
He has a plan.

579
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:07,080
- God told you?
- Yes.

580
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,999
- The god?
- Yes.

581
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,995
- I know how this sounds.
- It sounds crazy.

582
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:17,989
But something told me
to turn on the radio.

583
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,753
Something told me to come here.

584
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:22,713
My voice on the radio
told you to come here, Anna.

585
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,957
You were trying to kill yourself
last night?

586
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,110
Anna.

587
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:29,432
I got here just in time to save your life.
That's a coincidence?

588
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:33,230
- Just stop it. Stop it. Stop.
- He must have sent me here for a reason.

589
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,438
Neville, the world is quieter now.

590
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,711
You just have to listen.

591
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:42,030
If we listen...

592
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,677
...we can hear god's plan.

593
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,917
- God's plan?
- Yeah.

594
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,640
All right. Let me tell you
about your god's plan.

595
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,713
There were 6 billion people on earth
when the infection hit.

596
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:57,477
Kv had a 90 percent kill rate.
That's 5.4 billion...

597
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:00,109
...people dead.

598
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:03,113
Crashed and bled out, dead.

599
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,157
Less than 1 percent immunity.

600
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:09,109
That left 12 million healthy people
like you, me and Ethan.

601
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:13,433
The other 588 million...

602
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,637
...turned into your darkseekers.

603
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:17,438
And then they got hungry.

604
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:22,032
And they killed and fed on everybody.

605
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,271
Everybody!

606
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,949
Every single person
that you or I has ever known...

607
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,077
...is dead!

608
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,317
Dead!

609
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:41,393
There is no god. There is no god.

610
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,512
What is that?

611
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:55,191
Was it still dark when you
brought us home last night?

612
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:58,478
You were bleeding.
There was light on the horizon.

613
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,793
Turn the light off. Turn it off.

614
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,519
They followed us home.

615
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:13,353
Ethan.

616
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,193
Shit.

617
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,513
Anna.

618
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,878
Anna.

619
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:25,233
Anna!

620
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,791
Anna!

621
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,799
Anna!

622
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,878
Anna?

623
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,598
Anna.

624
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,636
Come on. Come on.

625
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:40,637
- Are you okay? You all right?
- Yeah.

626
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,353
Are you all right?

627
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,116
- You okay?
- Oh, my god. You're bleeding.

628
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,394
Go to the lab. Downstairs, go!

629
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:04,473
Get to the lab! To the lab!

630
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:14,790
Get behind the plexi.

631
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:17,313
Oh, my god. Come on.

632
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,672
Come on, it's okay. It's okay.

633
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,232
Oh, my god.

634
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,711
It's working.

635
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,434
Neville...

636
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,518
...it's working.

637
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,632
No! Stop! Stop!

638
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,236
Look, look, look, I can save you.

639
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:12,870
I can sa-- I can help you.
You are sick and I can help you.

640
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,957
I can-- I can fix this!

641
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:19,679
I can save everybody!

642
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:23,037
I can fix everything! It's working.
It's working!

643
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:27,719
Stop! Stop!

644
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:37,316
Let me save you! Let me save you!

645
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:38,470
No, no!

646
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:50,600
No, no!

What are you doing?

650
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,319
Open the door, please.

651
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:38,789
What are you doing?

652
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:42,478
I'm listening.

653
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,111
Shh, shh, shh...

654
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:10,114
Don't look.

655
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,718
I need to get a syringe.

656
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:19,669
I'm sorry.

657
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:25,037
