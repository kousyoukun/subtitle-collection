I think we just missed her
         at Little Diva.

732
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:32,735
Something tells me
 she ain't got a lot of friends.

733
00:44:39,411 --> 00:44:42,145
Okay, so she's held up
       at a record studio

734
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:44,213
wasting police time and money
    in the middle of nowhere.

What's the fight over?

736
00:44:46,084 --> 00:44:49,419
Last seen yelling on the phone
    at her daddy's business.

737
00:44:51,322 --> 00:44:53,056
-It's money.
       -You're kidding me.

738
00:44:53,058 --> 00:44:55,091
-A ransom?
         -Look at that.

739
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,431
Fucking awesome.

740
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:15,044
I'm sorry to say
    I think it's time to make

741
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:17,080
that anonymous call.

742
00:45:17,082 --> 00:45:18,848
Russian's probably got
      enough coke in there

743
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:22,185
to put him away.
      We're not doing that.

744
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:23,853
Let's see where she goes.

I'm saying
  that you produced four boxes

   that nobody wants for free.

    Oh, yeah. Okay. [scoffs]

759
00:47:12,564 --> 00:47:14,831
Oh, yeah, I bet you just wanted
     half of my dad's money.

760
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:16,332
Why are you even
      getting a cut anyway?

761
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,501
I mean,
   all you did was fucking...

  find it there, so don't try--

     who the fuck they were!

768
00:47:34,052 --> 00:47:35,318
Maybe they were just
       trying to book me!
