Luckily, I'm a quick learner.
I'll give you my tips.

One, when in missionary

flat on his chest

and brace, brace,
brace with your arms.

Two, in doggy

1146
01:03:13,617 --> 01:03:16,447
you can essentially keep
crawling away from the penis.

Every time he tries to get
a bit more inside

1148
01:03:18,346 --> 01:03:20,348
you just gallop a little faster.
