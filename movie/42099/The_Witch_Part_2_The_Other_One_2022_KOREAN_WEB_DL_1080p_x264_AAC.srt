1
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,240
My child.

2
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,030
Come to me.

3
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,830
Come to Mommy.

4
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,960
Hurry.

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Come to me.

6
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,090
Come to me, my child.

7
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,060
Let's all sing together.

8
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,150
Don't hate your friends.

9
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,690
Just once in my life.

10
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,990
Let's go on a long voyage.

11
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,660
Love each other, my friend.

12
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,450
Be happy, my friend.

13
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,250
Is the tape jammed?

14
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,750
Do you want me to untie it for you want me to untie you?

15
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,920
No, I'm fine.

16
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,250
I'll do it in a minute.

17
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,170
Let's just use the MP3.

18
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,840
Who listens to Walkman now?

19
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,680
It's all going to be broken by you.

20
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,640
Try this.

21
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,050
It's delicious.

22
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,430
Delicious, isn't it?

23
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,640
Delicious.

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,430
Delicious, isn't it?

25
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,100
That one.

26
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,520
What did you do last night?

27
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,770
Why have you been sleeping?

28
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,280
Hey.

29
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,200
You sleep with Jae-hyun last night.

30
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,950
Isn't that right?

31
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,360
What are you talking about?

32
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,120
Am I right?

33
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,780
Hello?...

34
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,500
Look me in the eye.

35
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,080
I'm sure you did.

36
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
Stop it.

37
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,460
All right, I won't say it.

38
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,760
Having fun?

39
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,550
All night- Oh, my God.

40
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,680
I really won't.

41
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,180
I really won't.

42
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,880
Don't worry about it. Don't....

43
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,300
That guy's been like that ever since the beginning.

44
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,140
That pervert.

45
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,920
Where are we?

46
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,340
My neck.

47
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,560
Are you on the wrong track? - Where are we?

48
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,070
Where are we?

49
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,160
I don't think it's here.

50
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,660
Nothing.

51
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,120
Chief, is this the right place?

52
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,570
The sightseeing bus fell under the bridge.

53
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:56,830
Bodies found in damaged buses.

54
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:04,790
The windows are broken. There's luggage and wreckage everywhere.

55
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,010
The condition of the damaged vehicle shows what happened in the event of an accident.

56
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,100
A bus that fell from a twenty-one meter cliff,

57
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,060
has been damaged,

58
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:25,770
carrying 36 people on board.

59
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,820
The bus was going downhill

60
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,160
when it hit a guardrail and fell into a stream.

61
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,040
It's because the slope is too steep.

62
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,580
You woke up too early.

63
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,540
Don't be afraid.

64
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,340
Nothing's gonna happen.

65
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,220
My child.

66
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,010
I have a baby in my belly.

67
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,770
I know.

68
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,770
It's a girl.

69
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,350
This kid will have a brother.

70
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,230
They'll be twins.

71
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:14,150
The twins will have countless brothers and sisters.

72
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,500
We'll make it.

73
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,840
What do you mean?

74
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,930
Girl, it looks like you really don't know who you are.

75
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,270
Or are you pretending?

76
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,400
It doesn't matter.

77
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,360
You probably don't know.

78
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,360
We're with you.

79
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,920
The place where my aunt lives is good.

80
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,740
That's nice.

81
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,550
What's that?

82
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,090
Where did that come from?

83
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,740
That's what happens when you come to the old woman's house.

84
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
General manager,

85
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,670
The view here is amazing.

86
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,470
How did you find this place?

87
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,640
I should've stopped by more often to say hello.

88
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,980
I shouldn't have missed you so long.

89
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,310
You must be busy taking over so many new jobs.

90
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,310
It doesn't matter.

91
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,360
I can't believe I've drawn so many pictures.

92
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,950
You drew all of this yourself, didn't you?

93
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,740
Don't you want to hold a solo show?

94
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,120
It's a shame to leave the ashes like this.

95
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,370
I heard there was an accident in the lab.

96
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,300
Yeah, early this morning.

97
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,170
You're being too direct.

98
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,140
It's not like there's a problem with headquarters.

99
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,100
Yes, we do.

100
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,310
We got a little problem at the lab headquarters.

101
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,270
No, it's not.

102
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,400
It's not a small problem.

103
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,280
It's the headquarters that's been breached.

104
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,120
Talking to you, who is already retired, about these problems

105
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,580
is a little inappropriate.

106
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,620
But you were in charge.

107
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,460
There are some things that you still need to know.

108
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,710
Who could have done this?

109
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:40,710
It's not related to the previous generation's problem, is it?

110
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,590
Why do you ask?

111
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,550
Chief, your bad taste is still the same as always.

112
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,140
You're right.

113
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:59,070
After this group of rubbish destroyed the laboratory, it was scattered all over the place.

114
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,910
Chief, aren't you curious about that?

115
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,620
Who let those dolls out?

116
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,790
What's their purpose?

117
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,800
Only a small number of people in the foundation know about the existence of the laboratory.

118
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,510
There are only two organizations I can think of right now.

119
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,930
The Superhumanist organization,

120
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,140
and the Alliance.

121
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,600
So it's not on our side.

122
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,480
It's on your side, the chief executive.

123
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,310
Right?

124
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:51,450
We should investigate to find out right away.

125
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,120
No, we won't.

126
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,250
We don't have time to investigate our current situation.

127
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,880
It's been breached.

128
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,630
But from our point of view,

129
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,970
it's an internal breakthrough, not an external one.

130
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,470
What do you mean?

131
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,220
Yes.

132
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,400
The child was lost.

133
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,570
Not abandoned but lost?

134
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:30,200
Yes, the child was lost.

135
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,330
He walked out on his own.

136
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,130
It's over.

137
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,190
What's the matter with you?

138
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,230
Where are you going?

139
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,360
Want a ride?

140
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,700
You son of a bitch, why don't you answer the question?

141
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,950
What are you doing? Get in the car!

142
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,970
What are you doing?

143
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,060
What are you doing?

144
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,850
She's got nothing to do with it. Why take her?

145
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,520
Are you a humanitarian?

146
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,650
Isn't this the time for you to worry about others?

147
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,150
We might have to bury you

148
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,110
How can we leave witnesses?

149
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,580
We do things very rigorously.

150
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,040
How could she be so virtuous?

151
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:09,000
Is the blood on her body real?

152
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,460
Hyung, it looks like it's real blood.

153
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,130
What the hell does she do?

154
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,760
Let her go.

155
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,470
She didn't see anything.

156
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,810
You're so noisy.

157
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,430
She saw this car.

158
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,390
I think she even saw the license plate.

159
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,310
Cut the crap.

160
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,230
If it were you, could you see it?

161
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,650
That's not necessarily true.

162
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,940
41 River 0115

163
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,990
Did you really see that?

164
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,870
How did you see that?

165
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,500
What else did you see?

166
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,460
010－7562－3905

167
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,000
702, 309 Pillar Rock Building

168
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,510
It's okay, hyung. This is a set car.

169
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,520
Who the hell are you?

170
170
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,190
Do you live here?

171
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,280
Boss is asking you a question, son of a bitch!

172
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,110
What the hell are you doing?

173
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,030
Let her go.

174
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,910
Stinky woman, shut up!

175
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,750
Gun.

176
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,580
You bastards!

177
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,540
Don't bully innocent children.

178
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:39,510
Stinky woman, shut up and be quiet!

179
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,550
What the hell are you doing?

180
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,890
What's wrong with you?

181
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,220
Be honest with me, little brat.

182
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,470
Let go.

183
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,770
What the hell does this girl do?

184
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:54,690
Let go.

185
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,070
It's not the crazy guy who lives here.

186
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,070
Hyung, I think he's really crazy.

187
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,570
Right?

188
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,580
She's wearing a mental hospital suit, isn't she?

189
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,330
Let go of me!

190
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,480
Don't.

191
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,900
Stop it!

192
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,910
Don't do this.

193
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,540
You don't have to do it.

194
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,560
Hello, this is 119. May I help you?

195
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,820
Please speak.

196
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,440
Hello?

197
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,870
What's the matter?

198
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,870
Please speak.

199
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,580
Hello?

200
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,660
Hello.

201
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,590
Please don't hang up.

202
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,470
Come with me.

203
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,080
Yes, sir.

204
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,580
A little further down the street.

205
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,250
An ambulance just passed in front of me.

206
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,050
It's not that way. It's the second way.

207
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:13,260
Yeah, that's it.

208
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,510
Wait a minute. I'm coming out.

209
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,600
Uncle!

210
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,110
Uncle!

211
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,740
Kyung-hee, who the hell did this?

212
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,500
Yongdu, is that the bastard Yongdu?

213
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,670
Uncle, we have to go. Come on, come on.

214
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,500
Let's go.

215
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,630
But who is she?

216
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,000
That one.

217
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,720
Looks like she's seriously injured.

218
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,680
Huh? Nose bleed?

219
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,050
That one.

220
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,140
Hey!

221
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,020
Hey!

222
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,810
I'm serious.

223
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,560
Uncle, come on.

224
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,310
What the hell is going on?

225
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:04,900
Are you all right?

226
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,190
Get in the car.

227
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:07,860
All right, good.

228
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,470
It's true.

229
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:39,970
Kyung-hee.

230
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:40,550
Yes, sir.

231
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:47,060
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

232
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,480
I'm fine.

233
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,820
But that son of a bitch, Yongdu,

234
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,650
is now openly harming people.

235
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,860
That bastard should have a grudge.

236
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,490
How long has your father been dead?

237
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:04,080
So far, we haven't taken the land.

238
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,000
The bidding for the resort is already set.

239
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,250
In that case,

240
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,170
the subordinates are also the shareholders.

241
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,630
I'm ashamed of myself in front of them.

242
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,880
How's the kid?

243
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,850
What she said,

244
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,440
was something that feels particularly strange

245
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:35,780
but not so strange.

246
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,820
What?

247
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,160
No, no, it should be fine.

248
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:46,040
No matter how amateur I was,

249
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,210
I used to be a man flying all over the street.

250
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:53,920
When I was a kid, I saved your dad many times with this hand.

251
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:01,550
But don't you have to call the police?

252
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,930
Her wounds are unusual.

253
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,440
It always feels like a girl with a story.

254
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:21,610
That's why I'm even more afraid of calling the police.

255
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,070
Well, that's true.

256
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:26,990
It's not good for us to associate with the police.

257
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,660
And it's hard to explain the situation.

258
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:38,300
I'll take care of her until she gets better.

259
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,510
Yeah, just do it.

260
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,930
Captain, are you all right?

261
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,090
Why are you shooting again?

262
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,220
Scared the hell out of me, motherfucker!

263
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,480
I can hear you if you keep your voice down.

264
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,520
How many fucking times have do I have to tell you?

265
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,270
I can hear you fine with these receivers. You don't need to yell!

266
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,110
I'm just finishing up with a smoke.

267
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,280
Send in the clean-up girl.

268
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:15,450
Fuck! Come on, Chief.

269
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,700
Are you gonna do this every time?

270
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,040
If you keep insisting on going alone, you're gonna die.

271
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,420
Do you have a death wish or something?

272
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,710
You should have waited for me.

273
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,090
You plan on keeping us without backup?

274
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,760
Then you should have hauled ass.

275
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,930
I need to wrap up before the church members show up.

276
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:31,890
What?

277
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,890
Chief, you're the one who's setting the meeting time.

278
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,520
Yeah, yeah. Shut up and just go.

279
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,020
Not this son of a bitch. Why is he so noisy?

280
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,770
What's that?

281
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,230
Why are you talking shit about me?

282
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:43,900
Why are using Korean?

283
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,320
What's wrong with a Korean speaking Korean?

284
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,990
It's nothing. You're just fucking loud.

285
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,490
You still have that notebook around.

286
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,740
What happened to the iPad I gave you?

287
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,160
I'm old-fashioned.

288
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,460
I don't need the latest gadget.

289
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,750
Then give back the iPad. You don't even use it!

290
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,960
And that was the latest model.

291
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,300
This motherfucker is really-

292
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,510
Don't be an Indian giver.

293
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,260
And I use it, I do.

294
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,930
For what? I've never seen you use it once.

295
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,680
To watch Netflix before I sleep.

296
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,440
Fucking Netflix? I've been paying a big money for that.Fucking waste.

297
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,770
Whatever. It's been put to good use.

298
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,190
Shut up and just go.

299
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,320
This fucking bastard..

300
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,490
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

301
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,370
Kaesaeki? That's a curse word right?

302
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,330
Kaesaeki? That's a curse word right?

303
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,330
That's the F word, right?

304
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,000
Yeah, that's a swear word.

305
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,750
F word again!

306
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:42,710
F word! F word!

307
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,870
Guns stepped on the accelerator again.

308
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,380
You're swearing as usual.

309
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:09,600
Hey, I told you not to drink in your mouth.

310
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,930
What are the glasses for?

311
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:15,310
I think I use it when I drink.

312
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,520
Hey, boy, boy.

313
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:21,990
What's wrong with you?

314
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,780
Is that Yongdu?

315
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,040
No, it's not.

316
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:37,920
He's my brother's brother.

317
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,500
It's okay. It's okay.

318
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,460
Don't do that.

319
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,510
Let go of me, boy.

320
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,760
You son of a bitch.

321
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:48,930
Looks good.

322
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,220
But who is she?

323
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:57,810
She's the sister I know.

324
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,650
He'll be staying with us soon.

325
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,280
How long have you been in Korea?

326
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,990
Do you have a sister already?

327
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,700
I didn't know you were a cow.

328
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,240
It's like a cow.

329
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:22,170
Have you eaten yet, boy?

330
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,340
I'll fix you dinner too.

331
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:30,470
Bad boy.

332
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,650
Let's get dinner ready.

333
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,750
What's the matter? You don't have an appetite?

334
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,590
It's not that I don't have an appetite, it's not delicious.

335
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:09,130
He's a real kid.

336
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,010
Then don't eat it.

337
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,350
If you say it's not delicious, you still put the food in your mouth.

338
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,020
Is it because of the taste?

339
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,020
Just eat hard to survive.

340
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,690
I'm really this kid.

341
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,980
It hurts.

342
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,940
Of course it hurts you to beat your kid.

343
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:28,990
Your kid has been to my sister recently.

344
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:29,820
Talk back, kid.

345
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,700
Or else I'll step on your nose and face.

346
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,490
I said it hurts. Don't do this.

347
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,660
Don't do this.

348
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,450
Don't do this.

349
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,660
Can't you say anything that tastes bad?

350
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,620
Just heat up the instant rice.

351
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,290
I bought soup at the supermarket.

352
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:44,250
You need to be cleaned up today.

353
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,920
You impolite son of a bitch.

354
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,420
Don't talk back, kid.

355
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,470
Don't do that. What are you doing?

356
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,130
Let go of the kid.

357
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:50,970
I said don't do this.

358
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:51,510
Let go of the kid.

359
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:52,510
I said don't do this.

360
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,230
Now you are.

361
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,150
Did you just push me?

362
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,440
I asked if you attacked your sister.

363
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,320
I'm so sick of it.

364
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,150
What?

365
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,280
I hate this house. When did you run out?

366
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,450
Dad didn't come back until he died.

367
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,410
What are you talking about?

368
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,620
You know you're funny?

369
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,950
You're the one who said you hated running away.

370
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,120
He said he didn't want to see Dad, so he ran away.

371
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,870
My father's land.

372
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,210
When did you ever care so much about Dad?

373
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,340
Since when is this your home?

374
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:17,760
This is my room when I was a kid.

375
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,810
You can stay first.

376
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:43,500
This one.

377
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,540
I think so.

378
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:48,630
Put it on.

379
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,880
Put on your comfortable clothes and go to bed.

380
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,430
Then rest.

381
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:01,220
Tell me if you need anything.

382
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:08,940
That one.

383
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:14,110
I forgot to thank you.

384
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:16,650
Thank you.

385
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,200
Thanks to you, I survived.

386
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,130
Get some rest.

387
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:41,140
Get some rest.

388
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:15,710
The official name of the experiment is lab data point.

389
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:19,760
It's written as ADP for convenience.

390
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:22,470
It's going to take more than 40 years.

391
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,720
Children of the benchmark for this project.

392
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:44,280
That's what my sister and the superhumanists wanted.

393
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:45,830
A complete version of the model.

394
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:52,170
They've been looking for it for a long time.

395
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,460
Separating the ontogenetic genes

396
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:57,510
and attempting to reproduce it.

397
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,930
One of them is this kid.

398
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:16,070
Koo Ja-yoon is still missing?

399
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:17,530
All I know is that after leaving here, 

400
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,030
she showed up at the last lab last month.

401
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:26,740
The chief let go of the children he had found.

402
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:29,200
Actually, I was a little surprised.

403
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:37,500
She's better than I expected.

404
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,630
But Ja-yoon was also traumatized here.

405
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:46,180
So it's supposed to be inoperable for a while.

406
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:50,560
And she has weaknesses.

407
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:54,100
Her brain depends on drugs.

408
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,150
She can't do much to us all by herself.

409
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:59,480
But this kid's different, isn't she?

410
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,240
I don't know what kind of monster it will be.

411
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:11,080
It's always overflowing in this world.

412
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,710
It must be removed.

413
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,630
If the company knows about this,

414
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,300
both the chief and I are fucked.

415
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:29,600
It's supposed to break up our heads.

416
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,220
It's used as a base for experiments.

417
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:36,310
I see what you mean.

418
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:40,570
Think of it as paying off my debt from 10 years ago.

419
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,650
Then I'll go.

420
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:50,950
Just in case, they planted chips in the lab kids.

421
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,540
It keeps track of the state of the brain.

422
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:53,540
There's still room.

423
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:56,960
It'll help you find her.

424
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,670
But this one doesn't seem to work.

425
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,380
How do I use it?

426
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,510
Do you know how to use this?

427
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:09,760
What?

428
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:11,430
It's almost broken.

429
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:13,770
Stop licking.

430
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,020
It's dirty.

431
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,440
Captain, can we do this?

432
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:27,110
I mean...

433
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,160
He's not doing well. He's doing informal activities.

434
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:35,450
And that thing seems to be the company's main asset.

435
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:36,750
What's the matter?

436
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:37,370
Nothing.

437
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:38,710
Then go home.

438
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:41,750
Don't you worry?

439
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:44,090
Did you hear what Chief just said?

440
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,380
And the kids in the lab,

441
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:49,010
I had contact with them 10 years ago.

442
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,220
They're cruel monsters.

443
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:53,470
No, that's not it.

444
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:55,430
Stop talking nonsense.

445
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:58,390
Get them. They're starting to get in the way.

446
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,190
It's them, isn't it?

447
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,440
He's been with us since we came to Korea.

448
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:05,320
So what?

449
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:06,240
Hurry up and grab it.

450
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,320
Wait a minute.

451
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:43,440
What is it?

452
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:23,480
Looks like a local agent.

453
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,820
First of all, let's calm down.

454
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:35,990
Don't make a scene.

455
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:37,700
I didn't know you were working here.

456
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:40,000
Let's talk first.

457
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,670
Nice to meet you.

458
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:48,000
What are you talking about?

459
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,810
That's a little harsh.

460
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:00,930
Do you have to?

461
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,750
Stop it.

462
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:22,850
Tell your boss to come and see me.

463
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,390
There's a bus card. It's right in front of the bus stop.

464
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,100
Let's go back.

465
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,870
If you have something to say, just say it.

466
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:48,540
But did our captain know their boss?

467
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:51,630
Very familiar.

468
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:55,170
Is that the boss before the captain?

469
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:57,840
Yes,

470
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,470
ten years ago.

471
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,220
It was a long time ago.

472
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:05,600
Good thing.

473
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,350
Yes, fortunately.

474
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:12,310
But why all of a sudden?

475
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:13,320
Uhm..

476
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:14,570
That's right.

477
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:15,360
Why not?

478
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,360
Don't you like men?

479
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,150
Yes.

480
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,580
That's why I...

481
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:25,240
What, you son of a bitch?

482
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,490
Son of a bitch?

483
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,040
You're calling me names again.

484
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,500
Too much swearing in Korean.

485
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:32,960
Don't talk to me in honorifics.

486
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:33,750
Me?

487
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:34,670
Yes, you.

488
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:36,130
No, absolutely not.

489
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:39,010
I think it's because you're upset.

490
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:47,140
So where are we going now?

491
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,230
Wait for this signal.

492
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:52,520
Keep it open until you get a signal.

493
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:56,480
Wow, it's really primitive.

494
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:58,820
You know how big this island is, don't you?

495
00:58:58,940 --> 00:58:59,530
Don't you know?

496
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:00,530
Listen carefully.

497
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:03,740
It covers an area of 1,833.2 square kilometers.

498
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,700
It's like finding a needle in the ocean, you know?

499
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:09,660
Are you listening to me now?

500
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:53,460
My child.

501
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:56,290
Come to Mommy.

502
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,510
Come on.

503
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,260
Come to Mommy.

504
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,490
It smells like cow dung.

505
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:57,540
We need to level this place as soon as possible.

506
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:05,250
Is that Kyung-hee?

507
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,720
Long time no see.

508
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:10,340
I'm Yongdu.

509
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,890
Remember me?

510
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:17,890
Stay right there.

511
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,480
Hey, there.

512
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:26,610
Your father used to use it for hunting.

513
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,490
You should keep it at the police station.

514
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,950
You can't just leave it at home.

515
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,320
It's illegal.

516
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,580
By the way, you're from America.

517
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:38,250
America

518
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:42,920
It's a place full of guns anyway, isn't it?

519
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:47,460
But where's everybody else?

520
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,550
You're the only one who's holding that thing up.

521
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:51,970
What are you talking about?

522
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:54,050
What kind of weapon do you carry?

523
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,970
Four of my men are now semi-maimed.

524
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:58,720
Life is at stake.

525
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:04,860
My men are clamoring to call the police.

526
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,980
My uncle stopped me for a long time.

527
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,280
Hey, Kyung-hee, are we strangers?

528
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:14,320
Family business has to be handled by a family.

529
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,830
Don't involve outsiders.

530
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,370
That's not gonna work, you know?

531
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:22,080
By the way,

532
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:26,540
didn't wonderful father

533
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,210
teach you that?

534
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:31,260
I'm asking you.

535
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:39,220
All right. All right.

536
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,580
Well, that's all.

537
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:03,460
Well, let's talk a little bit today.

538
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:04,580
Say what?

539
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:05,830
I have nothing to say to you.

540
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:08,630
Hey, you've got that.

541
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,340
Shut up.

542
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:14,510
But have you ever shot anyone?

543
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:23,180
Let's go.

544
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:26,230
Don't come near me.

545
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:28,520
I told you not to come.

546
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,440
You hear me?

548
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,610
Bring it here.

549
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:37,240
Let me go, motherfucker.

550
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,820
- Be honest. - Let me go.

551
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:40,160
Let me go, motherfucker.

552
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:41,620
I ask you to let me go!

553
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:42,290
You scared me.

554
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:44,210
You dogs!

555
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:45,960
We're the best soldiers in the world.

556
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,460
Who's this kid?

557
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,710
Who are you, smelly kid?
558
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:51,130
Get out of here, motherfucker.

559
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:54,380
Don't hit my brother.

560
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:56,050
You fucking dog!

561
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:57,300
Hello? Hello?

562
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,140
Are you some kind of baseball player?

563
01:04:58,140 --> 01:04:59,430
- Don't hit him. - Hey.

564
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:02,600
Don't touch my brother.

565
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:09,610
Hyung, there's no one in there.

566
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:12,070
What, really nobody?

567
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:16,240
Hey!

568
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:22,030
I don't think Kyung-hee takes my uncle seriously.

569
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,370
You're gonna use this gun

570
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:26,040
to get rid of all these bastards?

571
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:29,710
What kind of crap do you keep talking about?

572
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:32,630
All right.

573
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,630
After all, Chul-ho and I are loyal.

574
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:39,300
Let's pretend nothing happened between our children.

575
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:41,430
It's a thing of the past anyway. What can we do?

576
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:44,350
So just sign the contract

577
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:45,600
and put your fingerprints.

578
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:50,150
What the hell are you doing here?

579
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,650
Do you want cows or sheep?

580
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:55,230
Besides, did I ask you to give it to me for nothing?

581
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,360
I'll give you a little more than the market price.

582
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:00,700
Just take the money and go to Seoul.

583
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:04,740
Why don't we go shopping and have a date?

584
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,960
Then I'll have a nice life with my brother.

585
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:11,040
Now my parents are gone.

586
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,880
You'll have to take good care of your brother from now on, won't you?

587
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,000
The house of Zhao,

588
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:16,920
I won't give it to you.

589
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:18,670
How many times do I have to say that?

590
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,430
Hello?

591
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:23,760
I've told you so much.

592
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,600
Why don't you give me a sincere answer?

593
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:28,430
Why are you so bold?

594
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:30,100
Your father is dead.

595
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,440
But what's going on now?

596
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,560
Are you denying reality?

597
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,230
I know.

598
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:36,440
My dad's dead.

599
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:39,700
Didn't you kill him?

600
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,370
You killed my father you bastard.

601
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:51,290
I've been patient with you for a while, but you don't hold back.

602
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,540
Close her mouth.

603
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:55,630
Looks like she's gonna have to be beaten.

604
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:57,340
That's fine,

605
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:00,010
as long as her fingerprints are intact.

606
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:04,010
Stop fighting, you bastards!

607
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:05,640
Let go of me!

608
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,060
Hey!

609
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:10,600
Daegil.

610
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:13,810
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

611
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:14,730
Daegil.

612
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:15,480
Stand up, you son of a bitch.

613
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,360
Come here. Come here. Come here.

614
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,780
Stand up, you son of a bitch.

615
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,360
Come here.

616
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:22,530
You son of a bitch.

617
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:27,740
That son of a bitch is getting on my nerves.

618
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,250
Do you have to be beaten to get your act together?

619
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,500
Say it. - Don't move, you son of a bitch.

620
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,380
My boss is talking to you.

621
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:36,670
Where are you looking?

622
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,760
I'm scared to death.

623
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:45,090
Who is she?

624
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:47,680
It's dangerous over there.

625
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:48,850
Get down.

626
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:51,430
Come down here and be careful not to get hurt.

627
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:52,560
Hey, get down here.

628
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,810
How did she get up there?

629
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:56,810
Why do kids these days have so much guts?

630
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:01,030
Hey, hey, hey. - Crazty woman.

631
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:03,990
Dangerous. Be careful not to fall.

632
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:05,570
What's she doing?

633
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:07,950
What are you waiting for?

634
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:09,580
Hey, hey, get down here.

635
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:25,090
What is it?

636
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:26,970
The circus?

637
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,150
What the fuck?

638
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:12,510
Did you just see that?

639
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:13,930
What's that...

640
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:19,060
Are you here to visit?

641
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:21,190
Do something about it, you bastards.

642
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:30,660
Don't come near me.

643
01:09:32,490 --> 01:09:33,490
Don't come near me.

644
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:34,950
Don't come near me.

645
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:37,660
Don't come near me.

646
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:54,060
Get out of here.

647
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:55,270
Don't come near me.

648
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:02,560
Go away! Go away!

649
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,700
Get out of here.

650
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:14,700
Go away! Go away!

651
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:21,630
Forget it.

652
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,040
Forget it. It's about time.

653
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:28,720
I'm all right.

654
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:30,970
So stop fighting.

655
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,230
Let's go.

656
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:40,390
Don't come again.

657
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:42,060
Got it?

658
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:47,900
I'm telling you to wake up.

659
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,280
Take your men down to the hospital.

660
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:53,700
Wake up, you son of a bitch.

661
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,960
Okay, I'll get my act together.

662
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:01,620
Let's get out of course.

663
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:03,630
Go on, go on, go on.

664
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:44,170
Does it hurt? Are you okay?

665
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:47,090
Hey,

666
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:50,460
who is she?

667
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:54,550
What did I just see?

668
01:11:57,470 --> 01:11:59,600
Just calm down.

669
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:04,060
Actually, I don't know.

670
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:06,310
Look at her.

671
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,190
What?

672
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,980
Is she really an alien?

673
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:13,740
It's not a cover.

674
01:12:15,950 --> 01:12:19,080
That was a scene from the movie.

675
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:20,990
How did you know her?

676
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,750
It's amazing.

677
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:24,460
That's amazing.

678
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,330
How long will she stay at our house?

679
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:28,540
May I speak to her?

680
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:29,880
Should I take a video and send it to YouTube?

681
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,420
I'm sure you made a profit.

682
01:12:33,170 --> 01:12:33,920
What are you doing? What are you doing?

683
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:34,800
It's not you.

684
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:37,090
Are you okay?

685
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,180
Are you sure you're okay?

686
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:40,510
Ouch.

687
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:43,350
What's this?

688
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:45,980
Take it off. What are you doing?

689
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:47,480
Answer me, brat.

690
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,690
Sister, don't do this.

691
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:54,190
Can you introduce her to me again?

692
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,070
You really have to get along with people like that.

693
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,700
That's amazing.

694
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:45,810
Who is this?

695
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:47,560
Isn't that Sergeant Cho?

696
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:49,020
Long time no see.

697
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:52,900
That's a good one.

698
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:56,730
I thought they were thrown away somewhere.

699
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:00,650
Looks like he's got a little conscience.

700
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:04,370
Is it because of faith?

701
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:06,240
Well, I have faith, too.

702
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,700
And you can't throw it away anywhere.

703
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:09,950
It can pollute the environment.

704
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,500
We should love the Earth.

705
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,170
You look as good as ever.

706
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:18,840
You're still handsome.

707
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:23,510
As you know, these things are born.

708
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:27,010
And you're still handsome.

709
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:29,970
His eyes are as sharp as ever.

710
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:32,980
Let's not talk about the past.

711
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,060
What?

712
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:36,730
Yeah, all right.

713
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:38,020
Well, let's forget it.

714
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:41,530
All right, then tell me something else.

715
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:47,700
Why did you come back so suddenly?

716
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:51,200
I didn't think you'd ever come back.

717
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:53,500
You know what you're asking.

718
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,210
Of course I know Chief called you back.

719
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:56,840
But why did you come back?

720
01:15:58,670 --> 01:15:59,340
What?

721
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:01,630
Is it because of that thing?

722
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:04,550
Chief is in charge of that thing.

723
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:05,720
Now that we've relegated to the second line,

724
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:06,590
just stay honest.

725
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:07,890
Why are you doing this?

726
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:09,640
What's wrong with you?

727
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:13,600
Is that thing?

728
01:16:15,690 --> 01:16:16,860
Are you doubting me?

729
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,740
Can't say a word.

730
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:26,740
How dare this damned bitch suspect me?

731
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,450
Hey, Koo Ja Yoon, that bitch!

732
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:33,500
The last person I'm looking for is Chief.

733
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,620
It evaporated silently after that.

734
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,040
You think that's it?

735
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:41,380
Koo Ja-yoon looted Hoffen Glass and Bangkok Labs,

736
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:42,880
before coming to Jeju Island.

737
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:45,130
And then she robbed the Shanghai lab, you know that?

738
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:46,630
It's a high-level experiment.

739
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,550
The drugs are all gone.

740
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:50,220
Plus, the lab's headquarters was stolen.

741
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:52,930
How dare you suspect me?

742
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,690
Hey, just get out of here.

743
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:01,730
If there's anything to do with that thing,

744
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:02,860
It won't do you any good.

745
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:05,610
I don't care about that company's group.

746
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:07,490
How do I fight behind your back?

747
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,030
I'll take care of it. Don't get in my way.

748
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,160
If I keep being followed, and it gets in my way,

749
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,750
I'm not gonna sit back and watch.

750
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:20,250
Oh, my God, you're such a man

751
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:22,630
speaking in a murderous tone.

752
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:26,840
Come on, let's not see each other again.

753
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:29,390
Let's go our separate ways now.

754
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:30,930
Hello, Hyun Joong.

755
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,010
Hey stinky girl!

756
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,350
We haven't seen each other in 10 years.

757
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:39,770
Are you sure you want to leave?

758
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:46,860
What else do you want?

759
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,030
You want to talk about 10 years ago?

760
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:51,950
Don't go. Take your time.

761
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:54,240
Be careful when they turn the car around.

762
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:59,670
This woman

763
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:04,630
has a really bad temper.

764
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:40,670
Are we almost there?

765
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,540
Around there, right?

766
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:49,050
Well, it's almost there.

767
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:55,300
The island isn't as small as I thought.

768
01:18:56,390 --> 01:18:59,270
Oh, it's so boring.

769
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,810
Hey, look at this, too.

770
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:07,020
It's funny in Korea. It's funny.

771
01:19:07,650 --> 01:19:09,650
Watch it. Watch it.

772
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:12,360
How do you always watch that?

773
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:16,240
What's the matter, bitch? Don't kill yourself, will you?

774
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:21,080
Watch your mouth, or I'll rip your fucking mouth off.

775
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,430
I'm just kidding.

776
01:19:35,890 --> 01:19:37,560
I won't argue with her again.

777
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:42,020
Let's do it.

778
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:54,740
Let's see who wins.

779
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:58,620
What's the matter?

780
01:19:58,950 --> 01:20:01,160
We fought one when we were kids.

781
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:05,540
Was that when you were a kid?

782
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:08,500
What do you say?

783
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:11,210
Have a fight.

784
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:21,180
Well, that's him.

785
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:28,230
How on earth did he survive?

786
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:31,320
He's got a bullet in his head.

787
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:34,110
How on earth have you lived to this day?

788
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:39,740
Logically speaking, at this level, you should be completely dead.

789
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:41,870
Is that right?

790
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:47,080
You think I made a mistake?

791
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:49,000
No, no, absolutely not!

792
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,300
How can something happen to noona's ability?

793
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:53,840
That's not what I meant.

794
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,720
I mean...

795
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:16,740
One small piece of fresh meat.

796
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:21,620
For the sake of your cuteness, I'll spare you. 

797
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:28,580
You're right.

798
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:32,000
It should be cut off completely.

799
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:41,970
Wait.

800
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,060
Come on, let's eat.

801
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:48,640
That's a good kid.

802
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,860
Is it good?

803
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:55,280
It's on the floor.

804
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:57,280
What about this, Abby?

805
01:21:57,860 --> 01:21:58,860
Come on.

806
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:01,530
What is it?

807
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:03,830
No, it's not.

808
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,710
No, what are you doing?

809
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:44,450
Hello, quack

810
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:50,290
stinky old man.

811
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,460
Are you still seeing a doctor?

812
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:55,380
You are cruelty to animals.

813
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:56,960
And...

814
01:22:58,010 --> 01:22:59,420
Didn't I say that if you'd see the underground deal,

815
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:01,380
I'll take your hand off?

816
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,680
No, you didn't.

817
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:06,560
These days, 

818
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:08,770
I really only treat cats and dogs.

819
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:11,560
And it's just a prescription.

820
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:15,440
I can't do the surgery anymore.

821
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:16,570
Really?

822
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:22,030
Then your hands won't work anymore.

823
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:29,700
Yongdu.

824
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:32,540
No, Mr. Hyun Joong.

825
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,420
Why are you doing this to me all of a sudden?

826
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,670
I won't tell.

827
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:41,090
I'm really not gonna tell you the story.

828
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:44,340
Be quiet. It's so noisy.

829
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:46,260
Shut up.

830
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,560
You should have something to say to me.

831
01:23:49,890 --> 01:23:51,850
Say what?

832
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,270
Kyung-hee's little girl.

833
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:58,070
The story about the girl.

834
01:24:00,190 --> 01:24:03,780
You must have something to say to me alone.

835
01:24:05,570 --> 01:24:06,200
Right?

836
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:30,760
She's the one wanted.

837
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:32,680
Looks like it.

838
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:34,350
Who's the continuing owner?

839
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:35,310
Did you get in touch?

840
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:37,480
Yes, hyung. I got the message.

841
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,990
Wow, that's funny.

842
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:47,160
It's exciting.

843
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:03,300
That's it.

844
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:05,010
This is Youtube where

845
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:09,640
they'll upload videos of them eating.

846
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:10,800
Keep uploading.

847
01:25:10,890 --> 01:25:12,810
If someone clicks in to watch,

848
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:13,890
and has a decent number of views,

849
01:25:13,890 --> 01:25:15,270
then we'll get the ads.

850
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,940
If you get an ad,

851
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:18,900
the money will come.

852
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,810
If you have a lot of fans,

853
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:24,860
I earn hundreds of thousands of won a month.

854
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:29,660
Hey, you there?

855
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:30,870
You're listening.

856
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:35,910
Anyway, they're just making money from eating.

857
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:39,000
You just have to turn it upside down once.

858
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,130
Then we'll be rich.

859
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:43,550
What's this?

860
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:47,470
Which one? This one?

861
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:48,300
Mixed noodles

862
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:49,470
Is it good?

863
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:53,640
It's delicious.

864
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:55,810
Shall we go eat this?

865
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,690
Yeah, let's go eat.

866
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,650
No, are you listening to me seriously?

867
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:04,820
What's this?

868
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:05,650
Which one?

869
01:26:05,650 --> 01:26:07,240
Oh, hot dog.

870
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:08,530
Next to it is pizza.

871
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:09,360
Is it good?

872
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:16,040
Hey, are you listening to me?

873
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,450
Are we going to eat this too?

874
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:19,210
I'll get you a hot dog later.

875
01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:20,790
I'll give you some pizza later.

876
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,040
I asked if you were listening to me.

877
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,090
What's this?

878
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:27,460
Are you an eater?

879
01:26:27,470 --> 01:26:29,090
Why are you so greedy?

880
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:32,050
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

881
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:33,260
Forget it. Stop it.

882
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:34,100
Stop it.

883
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:06,420
Let's try abalone porridge.

884
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:08,920
It's on sale today.

885
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:17,390
This is a little hot.

886
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:20,600
Take your time.

887
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:00,140
Careful not to burn your hands and easy.

888
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:01,020
Hey, hey, hey.

889
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:11,030
She's finished.

890
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,440
It's all gone.

891
01:28:21,870 --> 01:28:22,410
Hello?

892
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:29,250
Hey, Hey, hey.

893
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,170
Hey, wait a minute.

894
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:39,970
Hello?

895
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,570
I'm sorry. I'll do it as soon as I can.

896
01:28:53,610 --> 01:28:55,740
What a shame, don't eat it.

897
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:57,610
Do you have aliens in your stomach?

898
01:28:58,870 --> 01:29:00,990
They say I can eat whatever I want.

899
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:02,410
You can eat, but you have to eat in moderation.

900
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:04,370
Is that how your planet is run?

901
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:06,960
Where's my sister?

902
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:12,170
GAMOR.

903
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:23,970
Hello. My sister's at Uncle's animal hospital.

904
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:26,480
Uncle's a little hurt.

905
01:29:26,770 --> 01:29:28,520
I'm sorry I left in such a hurry.

906
01:29:29,810 --> 01:29:31,650
Why don't you guys have dinner first?

907
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:32,900
I'll be there as soon as I can.

908
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:49,330
Would you like some water?

909
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:09,890
It's no use now, though.

910
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:15,230
But that's enough to stick.

911
01:30:18,650 --> 01:30:19,740
Kyunghee,

912
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,490
That kid,

913
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:29,750
Just let it go. I can't be with the kid.

914
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:33,290
While Yongdu hasn't caused any trouble,

915
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:34,590
let the kid go.

916
01:30:35,090 --> 01:30:38,130
We're gonna have to hand over the land and the house, okay?

917
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:43,350
Come on, let's go.

918
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:45,600
Daegil should be waiting for you.

919
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:19,380
What?

920
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:20,300
Hi, there.

921
01:31:23,390 --> 01:31:24,680
Who are you?

922
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:27,140
Don't be so scared.

923
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:29,270
Talk to us.

924
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:32,190
I'm going for real.

925
01:31:32,190 --> 01:31:34,190
Where have I heard all that talk?

926
01:31:34,650 --> 01:31:37,520
You can fly and throw it out with your bare hands.

927
01:31:38,150 --> 01:31:39,360
I'm going for real.

928
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,360
It's a girl.

929
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,360
What?

930
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:44,910
I don't know, man.

931
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:47,450
About 17, 18.

932
01:31:48,330 --> 01:31:50,790
I'll go. You know what her age is for.

933
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:52,620
Are you going on a blind date with her?

934
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:55,790
Didn't I tell you?

935
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:58,960
There's only one girl.

936
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:03,930
No need for that.

937
01:32:03,930 --> 01:32:07,470
I went and bought a couple of guns. 

938
01:32:13,890 --> 01:32:14,520
Hello?

939
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:18,400
Hello?

940
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:22,990
Hello?

941
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:25,150
What's with the phone?

942
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:28,870
Hello?

943
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,960
I'm going. That's a new phone.

944
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:40,550
Close the door.

945
01:33:07,490 --> 01:33:11,080
But who are you?

946
01:33:11,290 --> 01:33:13,080
Who is it?

947
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:14,700
You guys contacted us.

948
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:21,710
Ah, the girl is the one who..

949
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:24,840
Although it's a bit messy, you'd better sit down first.

950
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:57,210
Come on, let's talk.

951
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:01,420
Where is the girl now?

952
01:34:05,630 --> 01:34:09,840
You're gonna kill me if I tell you're gonna kill me, right?

953
01:34:09,930 --> 01:34:10,760
No, I won't.

954
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:12,010
Isn't that right?

955
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:16,350
If you don't tell me, I'll kill you.

956
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:25,020
But if you tell me quickly, I won't torture you. 

957
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:27,780
I was going to let you look at the organs in your body slowly and in detail,

958
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:35,870
just like he did,

959
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:37,250
and then I'll kill you.

960
01:34:37,870 --> 01:34:40,250
You haven't seen your own heart, have you?

961
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,500
Right?

962
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:45,290
No, I haven't.

963
01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:49,420
I'm not a cardiologist.

964
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:52,470
You don't have to look at that.

965
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:56,600
I can't even look at that's what I'm supposed to see.

966
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:02,350
But that one.

967
01:35:02,650 --> 01:35:06,610
I'm sure I'll be of some use.

968
01:35:06,730 --> 01:35:08,610
I'm sure there will be.

969
01:35:10,110 --> 01:35:12,410
It's a shame to just kill him.

970
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:14,410
I'm not a freeloader either.

971
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:18,540
After we talk,

972
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:23,080
we should be able to figure out our interests.

973
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:24,380
Isn't that right?

974
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:27,840
You tell me.

975
01:35:29,130 --> 01:35:32,930
I'll give you a present if I'm satisfied.

976
01:35:37,930 --> 01:35:38,970
Here, here, here.

977
01:35:38,970 --> 01:35:39,930
This one, this one, this one.

978
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:41,680
See? See? See?

979
01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:44,850
She's Koo Ja-yoon, a country girl.

980
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:47,230
It's not a song.

981
01:35:47,770 --> 01:35:49,940
I don't think you're gonna make it on YouTube.

982
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:52,650
Why don't we go on this show?

983
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:57,780
If you go, you'll be able to explode like Koo Ja-yoon.

984
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:00,910
Hey, you can't eat rice.

985
01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:02,910
You eat a lot, don't you?

986
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:05,210
But I've never sung a song.

987
01:36:05,330 --> 01:36:07,750
Hey, you really...

988
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:11,630
Just go to the karaoke and practice for a few days.

989
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,130
Compared to this,

990
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:17,470
other than picking people's joints and throwing the car out,

991
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:18,800
What else would you do?

992
01:36:18,930 --> 01:36:21,930
Just like her, be gentle.

993
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:24,690
Do something.

994
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:27,190
Let me get you some pizza.

995
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:29,820
It's not the same size as before.

996
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:31,190
Big?

997
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:33,860
Can I have fried chicken with the side dishes?

998
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:35,400
And I'll give you some pasta.

999
01:36:35,410 --> 01:36:36,990
Spaghetti?

1000
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,840
Are you a special?

1001
01:36:58,260 --> 01:37:01,430
It's not that funny.

1002
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:03,390
If you laugh like that..

1003
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:08,900
What's this? It's kind of pretty.

1004
01:37:12,570 --> 01:37:14,280
No, no, no, no, no, no. Hey.

1005
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,280
Stop laughing.

1006
01:37:16,450 --> 01:37:17,860
What are you doing?

1007
01:37:19,570 --> 01:37:21,580
It's not like that anyway.

1008
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:25,450
That's going to be like this, isn't it?

1009
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:50,690
Are you kidding me?

1010
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:51,770
Right?

1011
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:53,770
Hey, don't do it.

1012
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:55,780
Let me take a good look.

1013
01:37:55,780 --> 01:37:57,450
Try it. Try it again.

1014
01:37:57,450 --> 01:37:59,610
Do it right. Let me see.

1015
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:01,120
Try it.

1016
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:10,040
What?

1017
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:14,460
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.

1018
01:38:17,170 --> 01:38:18,840
You're amazing.

1019
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:21,970
How did you do that?

1020
01:38:22,970 --> 01:38:24,180
Hey, hey, wait a minute.

1021
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:25,680
You can't unplug that antenna.

1022
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:27,220
The antenna cannot be pulled out.

1023
01:38:27,310 --> 01:38:28,390
You need to watch TV.

1024
01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:30,390
Put it down. Put it down. 

1025
01:38:34,270 --> 01:38:35,270
I'll go.

1026
01:38:35,530 --> 01:38:36,530
That's crazy.

1027
01:38:36,530 --> 01:38:38,320
That's amazing.

1028
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,370
Did you destroy that star just now?

1029
01:38:43,950 --> 01:38:46,200
Is it possible to be this crazy?

1030
01:38:46,330 --> 01:38:49,460
Oh, that's not it.

1031
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,420
But where did you learn to say that?

1032
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:56,800
You have a gift.

1033
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:19,650
What? What? What?

1034
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:31,210
This is really the kid.

1035
01:39:31,210 --> 01:39:33,210
What did you see?

1036
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:52,230
She's a monster. I don't know when she'll mutate.

1037
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:55,730
If you don't want your brother dead,

1038
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:58,820
just listen to me.

1039
01:40:11,790 --> 01:40:12,910
Let's set the time of the clock.

1040
01:40:13,330 --> 01:40:15,370
The fireworks are about 30 minutes away.

1041
01:40:16,630 --> 01:40:18,090
If you don't handle it in the meantime,

1042
01:40:18,210 --> 01:40:20,090
The noise will attract the attention of the police or civilians.

1043
01:40:20,090 --> 01:40:21,590
It's gonna get bigger.

1044
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:22,760
Let's go.

1045
01:40:24,130 --> 01:40:24,880
But, Captain,

1046
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,140
If only her brother were to be taken out,

1047
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:28,510
Does the girl feel strange?

1048
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:30,970
What if she finds out she's running away?

1049
01:40:31,310 --> 01:40:33,560
Just pray she doesn't find out for a few minutes.

1050
01:40:36,810 --> 01:40:38,110
Why don't you go?

1051
01:40:38,690 --> 01:40:39,860
I need to cover the captain.

1052
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:41,440
Bullshit.

1053
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:42,690
Who's covering who?

1054
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:43,990
You don't have to go.

1055
01:40:44,990 --> 01:40:45,530
Captain.

1056
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:47,360
Captain.

1057
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:49,160
Captain, wait for me to go.

1058
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:07,180
Put glutinous rice balls on top of the rice and stutter.

1059
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:13,390
What's that?

1060
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:15,680
Really?

1061
01:41:16,230 --> 01:41:17,600
That's funny.

1062
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:38,500
Did she find out, Captain?

1063
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:43,460
I told you not to talk into my ear

1064
01:41:44,010 --> 01:41:45,550
and to curse.

1065
01:41:46,550 --> 01:41:47,630
Curse.

1066
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,840
I'm going for real.

1067
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:52,850
I really want to kill you.

1068
01:41:54,020 --> 01:41:55,560
That's right. Fireworks.

1069
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:56,980
There's a fireworks festival today.

1070
01:41:57,140 --> 01:41:58,100
What time is it?

1071
01:41:58,230 --> 01:41:59,650
It's time.

1072
01:41:59,650 --> 01:42:01,980
Let's go, let's go, let's go. Let's go.

1073
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:06,570
Fireworks?

1074
01:42:06,570 --> 01:42:08,110
It's so pretty.

1075
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:09,860
Don't you know that your planet doesn't have it?

1076
01:42:10,110 --> 01:42:13,410
Let's go over there. It's so beautiful.

1077
01:42:13,490 --> 01:42:14,330
Aren't you going?

1078
01:42:14,330 --> 01:42:15,790
Daegil.

1079
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:18,080
What's the matter?

1080
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:23,000
Let go of her hand.

1081
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:24,800
It'll be out soon. Get ready.

1082
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:27,760
When you see them coming out, keep your distance from the guns.

1083
01:42:28,590 --> 01:42:29,930
It's the captain.

1084
01:42:34,430 --> 01:42:36,640
Sister, what's wrong with you?

1085
01:42:37,310 --> 01:42:38,640
Run away.

1086
01:42:38,850 --> 01:42:40,640
What are you talking about? All of a sudden.

1087
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:42,650
I'm sorry.

1088
01:42:44,690 --> 01:42:46,360
Run away!

1089
01:42:50,610 --> 01:42:52,160
I'll go.

1090
01:42:56,950 --> 01:42:58,830
What do those guys do?

1091
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:26,770
Captain, look behind you.

1092
01:43:27,150 --> 01:43:29,150
They're from Shanghai Research Lab, right?

1093
01:43:38,330 --> 01:43:39,540
Who are you?

1094
01:43:39,620 --> 01:43:41,870
Didn't I tell you not to come here again?

1095
01:43:41,870 --> 01:43:43,540
Yeah, yeah.

1096
01:43:44,290 --> 01:43:46,840
Kyung-hee took out that pole again.

1097
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,550
But we do, too.

1098
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:49,960
Can you see what's going on inside?

1099
01:43:50,130 --> 01:43:51,380
She's on her way to the roof.

1100
01:43:51,670 --> 01:43:53,010
But the boy was with her.

1101
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:55,010
I'll go.

1102
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:56,510
Keep one's distance.

1103
01:43:58,220 --> 01:43:59,180
Come on.

1104
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:01,680
Hey, can you see there? There.

1105
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:03,440
That's the main road.

1106
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:05,440
Can you get there in one go?

1107
01:44:05,650 --> 01:44:06,810
Go, go, go.

1108
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:09,070
I'm going to my sister's. You go.

1109
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:13,070
Hey, there.

1110
01:44:14,070 --> 01:44:15,030
You'll be back, won't you?

1111
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:17,280
Come back when things get better.

1112
01:44:17,410 --> 01:44:18,410
We're going to karaoke.

1113
01:44:18,410 --> 01:44:19,660
I'll order you pizza every day.

1114
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:21,660
We must meet again.

1115
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:28,670
Where's the girl?

1116
01:44:30,090 --> 01:44:31,960
Who? What girl?

1117
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:33,970
Bullshit, impolite woman.

1118
01:44:33,970 --> 01:44:34,670
What?

1119
01:44:35,380 --> 01:44:37,260
All right, go to hell.

1120
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:42,520
Sister! Sister! My sister!

1121
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:09,080
Sister! Sister! My sister!

1122
01:45:09,710 --> 01:45:14,300
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1123
01:45:14,420 --> 01:45:16,420
Sister! Sister! Sister!

1124
01:45:20,010 --> 01:45:20,930
Did you find anything?

1125
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:22,560
No, Captain. Nothing.

1126
01:45:22,810 --> 01:45:24,350
I wonder if it's been blown up by two missiles.

1127
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:26,640
There's no such thing as that?

1128
01:45:26,850 --> 01:45:27,890
No, I didn't.

1129
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:28,690
But...

1130
01:45:28,690 --> 01:45:29,310
But what?

1131
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:30,270
There's something else here.

1132
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:09,120
Sister! Sister! Sister!

1133
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:12,370
I've had enough of your family.

1134
01:47:12,710 --> 01:47:17,670
There's a lot of kids like that, and they're gonna have to fuck with me.

1135
01:47:18,380 --> 01:47:21,300
I'm going to fight you, you fucking bastard.

1136
01:47:21,590 --> 01:47:25,640
I'm gonna kill you myself, goddamn it.

1137
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:29,930
Why am I so sorry?

1138
01:47:30,850 --> 01:47:32,730
Did I kill your father?

1139
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:36,060
Hey, do you know why your father died?

1140
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:38,860
He tried to kill me, but he died.

1141
01:47:38,860 --> 01:47:39,900
You know what?

1142
01:47:40,990 --> 01:47:44,950
I've been loyal for 15 years.

1143
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:50,120
Did you know I won all this land with my body?

1144
01:47:50,370 --> 01:47:51,500
You don't know, do you?

1145
01:47:54,710 --> 01:47:57,590
What are you doing talking to this kid about?

1146
01:47:58,050 --> 01:48:01,170
All right, you go with your sister.

1147
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:05,050
What a pain in the ass!

1148
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:07,680
Before I get angry, you guys go.

1149
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:09,680
It's not your turn to come to such an occasion.

1150
01:48:11,270 --> 01:48:12,270
What?

1151
01:48:12,770 --> 01:48:13,770
Do as you please?

1152
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:17,020
How can you decide for yourself?

1153
01:48:17,650 --> 01:48:20,020
Why are you ruining my fun?

1154
01:48:55,190 --> 01:48:57,100
I'll go, Captain. Did you see that?

1155
01:48:57,190 --> 01:48:58,560
She's not in the same position as the others before.

1156
01:48:58,560 --> 01:48:59,400
Shoot me, you son of a bitch!

1157
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:01,400
I'll go.

1158
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:27,240
I'm dying.

1159
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:47,170
Hello?

1160
01:50:48,470 --> 01:50:49,840
Run away!

1161
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:51,010
Come on, let's go!

1162
01:50:51,010 --> 01:50:53,590
Where the hell are you going?

1163
01:50:54,050 --> 01:50:57,350
Don't make me upset. Go to hell.

1164
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:04,020
Captain, again.

1165
01:51:06,530 --> 01:51:08,400
It's new.

1166
01:51:08,940 --> 01:51:10,190
- I'll go. - Oh, my God.

1167
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,530
That's how you keep telling me to cover for me.

1168
01:51:12,870 --> 01:51:14,120
Move aside.

1169
01:51:14,870 --> 01:51:16,910
It's brand new.

1170
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:25,000
Hello?

1171
01:53:34,630 --> 01:53:37,880
Wow, it's you.

1172
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:42,010
That's weird.

1173
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:46,600
I'm sure I've smashed your head.

1174
01:53:47,850 --> 01:53:49,650
How did you survive?

1175
01:53:56,240 --> 01:54:01,280
I'll take your neck off this time.

1176
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:30,140
Captain.

1177
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:31,310
How are the kids?

1178
01:54:37,150 --> 01:54:37,900
Captain, what are you doing?

1179
01:54:38,990 --> 01:54:39,860
He's an ordinary man.

1180
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:56,310
You're lucky.

1181
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:57,770
I'm scared.

1182
01:55:57,940 --> 01:55:59,480
I saw it.

1183
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:02,190
Didn't you pee?

1184
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:12,500
I'll go to the monsters.

1185
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:18,540
It's quite unexpected.

1186
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,800
Is it different from what it used to be.

1187
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:24,050
That's a bad breed, too.

1188
01:56:58,790 --> 01:57:00,500
There's another one.

1189
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:27,030
You son of a bitch.

1190
01:57:30,030 --> 01:57:31,120
It does hurt.

1191
01:57:31,790 --> 01:57:34,910
But what use does this have for us?

1192
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:23,170
What is it?

1193
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:28,840
She's ignoring us.

1194
01:58:54,370 --> 01:58:55,870
You're alive.

1195
01:58:56,700 --> 01:58:57,910
But...

1196
01:58:57,910 --> 01:58:59,750
Back then and now.

1197
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:03,630
She doesn't look very good.

1198
01:59:05,130 --> 01:59:06,750
Who the hell is she?

1199
01:59:07,630 --> 01:59:08,960
What's the big deal?

1200
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:36,530
You monster.

1201
02:03:41,950 --> 02:03:42,490
You.

1202
02:03:43,030 --> 02:03:44,280
Finally.

1203
02:03:58,750 --> 02:04:00,210
Long time no see.

1204
02:04:01,630 --> 02:04:03,170
Don't mess with me.

1205
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:19,860
But do you know each other?

1206
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:23,440
I understand.

1207
02:04:24,450 --> 02:04:25,450
How did we met?

1208
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:31,950
She was born to live alone in the laboratory headquarters.

1209
02:04:33,830 --> 02:04:35,000
She's my sister.

1210
02:04:36,210 --> 02:04:38,380
I told you to release my sister.

1211
02:04:38,710 --> 02:04:40,210
Who told you to kill her?

1212
02:04:40,340 --> 02:04:41,210
Jo-hyun.

1213
02:05:00,110 --> 02:05:02,690
Ah them?

1214
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:06,700
I sent them to you.

1215
02:05:06,820 --> 02:05:08,410
He's from Shanghai, China.

1216
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:15,870
I was a little hurt.

1217
02:05:15,870 --> 02:05:18,830
If you mess with me, I can't handle it.

1218
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,670
That's why I asked me a favor.

1219
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:28,340
But I wasn't sure if it was you at first.

1220
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:31,260
You've been bullied by them.

1221
02:05:34,930 --> 02:05:37,350
My sister can't be like that.

1222
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:41,900
So I don't think you're planning on leaving.

1223
02:05:45,570 --> 02:05:47,030
But here.

1224
02:05:48,610 --> 02:05:50,240
I feel you.

1225
02:05:52,950 --> 02:05:56,540
It's a bit awkward all of a sudden, isn't it?

1226
02:05:57,670 --> 02:06:01,040
Yeah, we're only together when Mom's in the womb.

1227
02:06:01,170 --> 02:06:03,500
I was born apart.

1228
02:06:05,380 --> 02:06:08,380
Did you just let me out?

1229
02:06:09,680 --> 02:06:10,800
Yes, sir.

1230
02:06:11,140 --> 02:06:12,100
Why not?

1231
02:06:12,680 --> 02:06:14,100
Because I need you.

1232
02:06:16,930 --> 02:06:19,020
You need me, too.

1233
02:06:19,980 --> 02:06:21,730
So why?

1234
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:26,820
If you want to see Mom,

1235
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:31,320
I've heard of it.

1236
02:06:32,490 --> 02:06:35,160
You and Mom's mind are connected.

1237
02:06:35,950 --> 02:06:37,750
Mom's been looking for you, hasn't she?

1238
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:40,620
She won't look for me.

1239
02:06:52,050 --> 02:06:53,850
Let's go with my sister.

1240
02:07:06,070 --> 02:07:09,940
You're treating your sister too coldly after a long time.

1241
02:07:27,630 --> 02:07:31,670
Are you in pain?

1242
02:07:32,470 --> 02:07:35,050
You know what it's like?

1243
02:07:35,390 --> 02:07:37,050
I want to save them.

1244
02:07:39,430 --> 02:07:41,100
You can do it.

1245
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:44,810
But there's no way to save both.

1246
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:47,650
You choose.

1247
02:07:48,440 --> 02:07:52,860
It's just that no one can be an ordinary human being.

1248
02:07:53,660 --> 02:07:55,160
Are you all right?

1249
02:08:21,600 --> 02:08:25,390
Wouldn't it be better to die as a human being?

1250
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:07,730
Go to your mother's with your sister.

1251
02:10:16,720 --> 02:10:20,300
The children met in the end.

1252
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:25,640
They'll be looking for their mothers soon.

1253
02:10:31,060 --> 02:10:35,900
How do you draw it like this?

1254
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:45,950
Then let's get ready.

1255
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:15,020
Don't be silly! There's colored eggs at the end.

1256
02:14:28,260 --> 02:14:31,260
I almost suffocated.

1257
02:14:33,970 --> 02:14:35,180
They're gone.

1258
02:14:35,350 --> 02:14:36,640
Let's go.

1259
02:14:38,890 --> 02:14:39,520
Captain.

1260
02:14:41,190 --> 02:14:42,650
Captain, they're gone.

1261
02:14:45,070 --> 02:14:46,530
Captain, they're gone.

1262
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:50,240
Captain.

1263
02:14:52,530 --> 02:14:54,240
Captain! Captain!

1264
02:14:57,290 --> 02:14:59,330
Captain! Captain!

1265
02:15:00,040 --> 02:15:01,000
Captain, wake up.

1266
02:15:01,170 --> 02:15:02,670
Captain, can you hear me?

1267
02:15:03,250 --> 02:15:04,080
Captain.

1268
02:15:04,710 --> 02:15:07,170
What if you just die?

1269
02:15:07,420 --> 02:15:08,090
I'll go.

1270
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:19,060
I heard your voice. Those monsters still have to hear your voice.

1271
02:15:26,610 --> 02:15:27,820
The children were taken away.

1272
02:15:30,030 --> 02:15:31,490
What are you doing?

1273
02:15:31,700 --> 02:15:33,160
Help me up.

1274
02:15:39,750 --> 02:15:40,660
Let's go.

1275
02:15:40,750 --> 02:15:42,120
We have to go after them.

1276
02:15:43,710 --> 02:15:44,960
Give me your cell phone.

1277
02:16:13,070 --> 02:16:14,990
You memorized my cell phone number.

1278
02:16:15,990 --> 02:16:18,030
What's the matter?

1279
02:16:18,370 --> 02:16:20,040
I thought you said you'd never see me again.

1280
02:16:20,330 --> 02:16:22,540
Since when have you been there?

1281
02:16:23,120 --> 02:16:25,330
You don't care when I got here. Just get to the point.

1282
02:16:26,170 --> 02:16:27,330
Yes.

1283
02:16:27,880 --> 02:16:30,000
I never wanted to see you again.

1284
02:16:30,420 --> 02:16:34,550
But the situation does not permit us to be backed up.

1285
02:16:34,930 --> 02:16:37,970
Why should I help you? You doubt me.

1286
02:16:38,100 --> 02:16:40,640
That's mean.

1287
02:16:41,270 --> 02:16:43,810
Are you still trying to figure that out? You're not a baby.

1288
02:16:44,020 --> 02:16:45,810
Well, that's a good idea.

1289
02:16:46,060 --> 02:16:47,480
So what do you want me to do?

1290
02:16:47,730 --> 02:16:49,480
- I'll go. - Oh, my God.

1291
02:16:49,900 --> 02:16:52,190
Are you going to keep talking like this?

1292
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:54,990
Hurry up and catch them!

1293
02:16:56,280 --> 02:16:58,870
My phone's a new.

1294
02:17:04,620 --> 02:17:06,120
Don't worry.

1295
02:17:06,920 --> 02:17:10,090
I know where they're going.
