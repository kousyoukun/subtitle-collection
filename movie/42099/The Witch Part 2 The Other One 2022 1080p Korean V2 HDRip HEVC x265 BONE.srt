1
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:28,400


2
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:43,400
PLAY. MAXWIN. WITHDRAW. REPEAT.

3
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,640
My son.

4
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,430
Come here.

5
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,230
Come on mom.

6
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,360
Here.

7
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Come here.

8
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,490
Son, come here.

9
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,460
Everyone, let's sing.

10
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,650
Is the cassette stuck?

11
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,150
Want me to help fix it?

12
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,320
No need.

13
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,650
I'll do it later.

14
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,570
Let's use MP3.

15
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,240
Who's listening to
<i>walkman</i> right now?

16
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,080
You're so messed up.

17
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,040
Try.

18
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,450
Very tasty.

19
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,830
Yummy, right?

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,040
Delicious!

21
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,830
Delicious!

22
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,500
Oh yes...

23
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,920
What did you do last night?

24
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,170
Why are you sleeping?

25
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,680
Hey ...

26
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,600
You slept with Jo-hyeon last night, right?

27
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,350
Right?

28
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,760
What are you talking about?

29
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,520
I was right?

30
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,180
Not.

31
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,900
Look into my eyes.

32
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,480
Must have done that.

33
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,480
Don't say that.

34
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,860
I know. I'll stop.

35
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,160
Happy?

36
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,950
Overnight ...
- Shit.

37
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,080
I really won't talk about it.

38
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,580
Really, I'm not going to talk about it again.

39
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,280
Not care.

40
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,700
The man was like that from the start.

41
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,540
What a pervert.

42
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,320
Where is this?

43
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,740
Ouch, my neck.

44
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,960
Is this the wrong way?
- Where is this?

45
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,470
Where is this?

46
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,560
This doesn't seem to be the place.

47
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,060
There isn't anything.

48
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,520
Director, is this really the place?

49
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,970
A tour bus fell on the bridge.

50
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:10,230
One by one the bodies were found in
the damaged bus.

51
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:18,190
Broken windows and
scattered belongings.

52
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,410
The condition of the damaged vehicle shows
what happened at the time of the accident.

53
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,500
The bus fell off a twenty-one meter cliff.

54
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,460
It's broken, and can't be repaired.

55
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:39,170
The bus was carrying 36 members of the association.

56
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,220
As the bus drove down the hill,

57
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,560
the bus hit the road divider and
fell into the river,

58
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,440
because the slope is too steep.

59
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,980
Get up too early.

60
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,940
No need to be afraid.

61
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,740
Nothing will happen.

62
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:05,620
My son.

63
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,410
There is a child in my stomach.

64
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,170
I know.

65
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,170
That's a girl.

66
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,750
The child will have a brother.

67
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,630
They will be twins.

68
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,550
Twins with many siblings.

69
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,900
We will make them.

70
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,240
What do your words mean?

71
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,330
Girl, it seems you really don't know
who you are.

72
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,670
Or just pretend?

73
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,800
No problem.

74
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,760
Maybe you don't believe it.

75
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,760
We are on your side.

76

86
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,320
Auntie lives in a nice place.

87
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,140
It's very beautiful here.

88
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,950
What else is it?

89
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,490
Where did you get it from?

90
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,140
Right. That's what happens when you
come to the old lady's house.

91
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,900
Chief.

92
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,070
The view here is very nice.

93
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,870
How did you find a place like that?

94
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,040
I should come and say hello more often.

95
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,380
I shouldn't have
ignored you for so long.

96
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,710
You must be very busy with
your new job.

97
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,710
No problem.

98
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,760
Didn't expect you to draw so much.

99
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,350
You drew all this, didn't you, Chief?

100
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,140
Why not hold a single exhibition?

101
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,520
It's a shame to leave
it dusty like this.

102
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,770
Listen, there was an accident in the lab.

103
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,700
Yes, this morning.

104
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,570
You're too revealing, aren't you?

105
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,540
That's not a problem in Ark Main, is it?

106
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,500
That's right.

107
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,710
There was a small problem in Ark Main.

108
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,670
Not.

109
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,800
Not a small problem.

110
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,680
That's Ark Main's offense.

111
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,520
Telling retirees about this disorder,

112
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,980
this is a little inappropriate.

113
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,020
But you're in charge.

114
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,860
There are some things you still need to know.

115
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,110
Who can do it?

116
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:54,110
It couldn't be attributed to the problematic clay doll
from the previous generation, right?

117
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,990
Why are you asking this question?

118
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,950
As usual, your mouth is spicy, chief!

119
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,540
You are right.

120
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:12,470
This pile of trash separated the lab
after they destroyed it.

121
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:18,310
Chief, aren't you curious about that?

122
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,020
Who put those dolls out there?

123
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,190
And what is their purpose in doing that?

124
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:33,200
Only a small part of the consortium is aware of the existence of the lab.

125
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,910
There are only two organizations
I can suspect now.

126
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,330
Transhumanist organization

127
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,540
and alliances.

128
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,000
So, not from us.

129
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,880
Rather, from your side, Chief.

130
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:50,710
So true.

131
00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:04,850
We will soon find out which side it is on.

132
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,520
Not.

133
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,650
In the current situation, we don't have time to investigate slowly.

134
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:17,280
Although it has been violated,

135
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,030
but from our point of view,

136
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,370
It breaks through from the inside, not from the outside.

137
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,870
You mean...

138
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,620
Of.

139
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,800
Girl is missing.

140
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,970
Not abandoned, but lost?

141
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,600
That's right, lost.

142
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,730
It came out on its own.

143
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,530
It is over!

144
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,590
What's going on here?

145
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,630
Where are you going?

146
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,760
Want a ride?

147
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,100
Less than that, why don't you answer an adult's question?

148
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,350
What are you waiting for? Get in the car!

149
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,370
Damn, what are you doing?

150
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,460
What are you doing?

151
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,250
He has nothing to do with this. Why did you bring him?

152
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,920
Are you a humanitarian?

153
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,050
This is not the time for you to worry about other people.

154
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:08,550
We might have to bury you.

155
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,510
How can I leave a witness?

156
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,980
We are very strict about work.

157
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,440
Why is he like this?

158
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,400
That blood on his body, real blood?

159
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,860
Boss, looks like real blood.

160
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,530
What is she doing?

161
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,160
Stop playing. Let him go.

162
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,870
He saw nothing.

163
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,210
You're noisy.

164
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,830
He sees the car.

165
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,790
Perhaps, he even saw the license plate.

166
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,710
Don't be ridiculous.

167
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,630
If it's you, can you see it?

168
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,050
That's not necessarily true.

169
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,340
41 Sungai 0115.

170
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:54,390
Did you really see it?

171
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,270
How could that be?

172
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,900
What else did you see?

173
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,860
010-7562-3905.

174
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,400
No. 702, Building 309, Stone Pillar Building.

175
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,910
Boss, it's okay. It's a set with the car.

176
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,920
Who are you?

177
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,590
You live here?

178
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,680
You were asked by the Boss.

179
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,510
What are you doing?

180
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,430
Stop playing and let him come back.

181
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,310
Shut up, bitch!

182
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,980
You jerks.

183
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,940
Do not disturb innocent children.

184
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:52,910
Shut up, bitch!

185
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,950
What are you doing?

186
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,290
What's with that?

187
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,620
Watch your attitude, brat!

188
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,870
Let go!

189
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,170
What is this girl doing?

190
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,090
Let go!

191
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,470
You're not the lunatic living here, are you?

192
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,470
Boss, it looks like he's a lunatic.

193
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,970
Ya, benar.

194
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,980
He's wearing a mental hospital outfit.

195
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,730
Let go of me!

196
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,880
Don't.

197
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,300
Stop.

198
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,310
Do not do it.

199
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,940
No need to continue.

200
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,960
Hello, this is 119, how can I help you?

201
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,220
Please talk.

202
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
Halo?

203
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,270
What can I do for you?

204
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,270
Please talk.

205
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,980
Halo?

206
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,060
Halo.

207
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,990
We'll send someone there.
Please don't close.

208
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,870
Follow me.

209
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,480
Uncle.

210
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,980
From there, it's just a short walk.

211
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,650
I just passed an ambulance.

212
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,450
Not that way. The second way.

213
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:26,660
Ya, benar.

214
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,910
Wait, I'm going out.

215
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,000
Uncle.

216
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,510
Uncle.

217
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,140
Oh my gosh, Kyung Hee. Who did this?

218
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,900
Yong-doo, that bastard again?

219
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:56,070
Uncle, we have to leave immediately.
Come on.

220
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:56,900
Ayo.

221
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,030
But who is he?

222
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,400
It...

223
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,120
It seems he was badly injured.

224
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,080
He had a nosebleed.

225
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,450
It...

226
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,540
Son ...

227
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,420
Son ...

228
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,210
Good grief.

229
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,960
Uncle. Hurry up.

230
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,710
What is this?

231
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,300
You are okay?

232
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,590
Take him to the car.

233
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,260
Well.

237
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,370
Kyung Hee.

238
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:53,950
Of?

239
00:33:55,540 --> 00:34:00,460
How do you feel?
You are okay?

240
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,880
I am fine.

241
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,220
But that bastard Yong-doo....

242
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,050
Now it's all dangerous.

243
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,260
That bastard must be holding a grudge.

244
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,890
How long has your father been dead?

245
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,480
I haven't even got the land yet.

246
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,400
Resort offers are in sight.

247
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,650
Like that.

248
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,570
Also for those shareholders.

249
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,030
I even look bad in front of them.

250
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,280
How's the kid?

251
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:36,250
He... Well...

252
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:43,840
It's kind of weird.

253
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:49,180
Not so strange.

254
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,220
What?

255
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:55,560
It is nothing. He should be fine.

256
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,440
This uncle is an amateur,
after all...

257
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,610
I used to be a person who lived on the streets.

258
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:07,320
When I was little, I saved
your father's life with these hands over and over again.

259
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:14,950
But shouldn't you call the police?

260
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,330
Some of the wounds are also unusual.

261
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:24,840
It always feels like
a girl with a story.

262
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:35,010
So, I was more afraid to call the police.

263
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,470
Right.

264
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:40,390
There's no point in dealing with the police.

265
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:44,060
And it's hard to explain the situation.

266
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,700
I will take care of him until he recovers.

267
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,910
Yes, let's do that.

268
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,330
Captain, are you all right?

269
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,490
Why are there more shots?

270
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,620
Damn. You scared me.

271
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,880
I can hear you even if
you only lower your voice.

272
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,920
How many times have I told you, damn it?

273
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:34,670
Now the ear speaker performance is good.

274
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,510
I'm smoking.

275
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,680
Have the cleaning staff come in and clean up.

276
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:28,850
Geez, Captain.

277
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,100
Do you have to go on like this?

278
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,440
You're really going to die if you go alone like this.

279
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,820
You want to die?

280
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,110
Why not wait for me?

281
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,490
Should you always go alone
without help?

282
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,160
Then you wouldn't have come sooner.

283
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,330
Shouldn't it be handled before the common people come?

284
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,290
What?

285
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,290
Captain, didn't you
give the time to gather?

286
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,920
Yes. Just shut up and drive.

287
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,420
What's with this jerk? Why
is the sound so loud?

288
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,170
What?

289
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,630
What did you say to me?

290
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,300
You cursed me, right?
Why suddenly use Korean?

291
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,720
What's wrong with Korean people speaking
Korean?

292
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,390
It's nothing. It's just that you're noisy.

293
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,890
Why are you still using the manual?

294
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,140
Where's the tablet I bought you?

295
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,560
Don't worry. I like the manual way.

296
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,860
I don't like using tenolology like that.

297
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,150
So, just return it, if you don't
use it.

298
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,360
That's the latest model.

299
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,700
This guy really is a jerk.

300
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,910
Don't ask for what you gave back.

301
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,660
I use it. Really.

302
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,330
What is it used for?
I never saw you use it?

303
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,080
To browse Netflix before going to bed.

304
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:35,840
For Netflix? Using expensive stuff for that?

305
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:39,170
It doesn't matter what.
The important thing is to use it.

306
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,590
Shut up and walk, asshole.

307
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,720
Damn, really asshole.

308
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,890
You did it on purpose, right?

309
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:50,770
Keiko's dog.

310
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:51,730
That's a swear word, right?

311
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:52,730
That's an insult, right?

312
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,400
Yes, that's a swear word.

313
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,150
Again cursing at me.

314
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,110
Again and again.

315
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,270
Faster.

316
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,780
You swore a little.

317
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:23,000
Hey, I told you not
to drink straight from the bottle, didn't I?

318
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,330
What's the glass for?

319
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,710
It was for my sister while drinking.

320
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,920
This child.

321
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,390
Why do you look like that?

322
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,180
Is the boy Yong-doo's errand?

323
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,440
It doesn't matter.

324
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:51,320
She's my sister.

325
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,900
That's okay.

326
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:54,860
Do not do it.

327
00:44:58,740 --> 00:44:59,910
Let go of me.

328
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,160
Damn!

329
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:02,330
Looks fine.

330
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,620
But who is he?

331
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:11,210
This is my adopted sister.

332
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:14,050
Will be living in our house in the near future.

333
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:16,680
How long have you been in Korea?

334
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,390
You have a foster sister so soon?

335
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,100
I didn't think you were a social cow.

336
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,640
It's like a social cow.

337
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,570
Hey, have you eaten?

338
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,740
Want me to prepare dinner too?

339
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,870
Rude child.

340
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,050
Let's prepare dinner.

341
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:16,150
What is wrong? No appetite?

342
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,990
It's not appetizing, it's not appetizing.

343
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:22,530
This child.

344
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,410
So do not eat it.

345
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:27,750
Say it's not good and
I'll stuff it all in your mouth.

346
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,420
Is it because of his appetite?

347
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,420
Live only for hard to eat.

348
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,090
Really this kid.

349
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,380
It hurts.

350
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,340
Of course it hurts to hit you, son.

351
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,390
Don't be rude to your sister.

352
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:43,220
Fight back.

353
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:44,890
Sick. Do not do this.

354
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,060
Do not do this.

355
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:46,850
What?

356
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,060
What's wrong with saying it's not good?

357
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:51,020
Let's just cook fast food.

358
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,690
Soup is also available in supermarkets.

359
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:57,650
You need to be given a lesson today.

360
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,320
You brat.

361
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,820
Don't argue.

362
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,870
Do not do it. What are you doing?

363
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:03,530
Let go.

364
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:04,370
I said don't do this.

365
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:04,910
Let go!

366
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:05,910
Do not do this.

367
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,630
Now...

368
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,550
You just pushed me?

369
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,840
I ask,
you just pushed your sister?

370
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,720
Really annoying.

371
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,550
What?

372
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,680
Time says you hate home
and run away,

373
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,850
I came back after my father died.

374
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:26,810
What do you say every day, brother?

375
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:29,020
You know you're funny?

376
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,350
You said you hated your family and
ran away.

377
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,520
You said you didn't want to see your father.

378
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,270
Father's land.

379
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,610
When did you ever care so much about dad?

380
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,740
Since when is this your home?

381
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:31,160
This is my room when I was little.

382
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,210
You can stay here first.

383
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:56,900
This one...

384
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,940
should match.

385
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:02,030
Try.

386
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,280
Put on comfortable clothes
and go to bed.

387
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:10,830
Have a good rest.

388
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:14,620
Just tell me if you need anything.

389
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:22,340
It...

390
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:27,510
I forgot to thank you.

391
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:30,050
Thank you

392
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:32,600
Thanks to you I'm still alive.

393
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:50,530
Take it easy.

394
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:54,540
Have a good rest.

395
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:29,110
The experiment's official name was
Ark 1 Datum Point.

396
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:33,160
Written records for convenience ADP

397
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,870
it will progress more than 40 years.

398
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,120
Project benchmarks for children.

399
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,680
My brother and the transhumanists were
looking forward to it.

400
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:59,230
Full version model.

401
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:05,570
In the past, they had managed to recover the body
they had been looking for.

402
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:09,860
Separating the body crystals that grow in the body.

403
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:10,910
Try to imitate.

404
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,330
One of them is this child.

405
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:29,470
What is the name of Goo Ja-yoon whose whereabouts are still unknown?

406
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:30,930
All I know is, after leaving here...

407
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:35,430
He appeared in the last lab last month.

408
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:40,140
The chief administrator released the child he found.

409
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:42,600
Actually I was a little surprised.

410
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:50,900
He's better than I expected.

411
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,030
But Ja-yoon is also very traumatized by this.

412
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:59,580
So he had to leave the action for
a while.

413
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:03,960
And he has a weakness.

414
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,500
His brain needs drug dependence.

415
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,550
He alone cannot do much for us.

416
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,880
But this kid is different, right?

417
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,640
I wonder what kind of monster he will be.

418
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:24,480
This type is always abundant in this world.

419
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:28,110
Must be removed.

420
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:38,030
If people know about this,

421
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,700
whether it's the chief executive or me,
it's over.

422
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,000
It will probably break our heads

423
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,620
for use as experimental substrates.

424
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,710
I see what you mean.

425
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:53,970
Let's just say, I paid off my debt
10 years ago with this.

426
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,050
Then, I'm out of here.

427
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:04,350
Just in case there are chips planted
in the children's lab.

428
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,940
It will record the state of the brain

429
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:06,940
and its location.

430
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:10,360
That will help you find it.

431
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,070
But this one seems to be broken.

432
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,780
How does it work?

433
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,910
You know how to use this?

434
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,160
What?

435
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:24,830
It's almost broken.

436
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,170
Stop licking it.

437
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:28,420
Disgusting.

438
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,840
Captain, can we do this?

439
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:40,510
I mean

440
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,560
it is not a formal activity when
it is not performing well.

441
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:48,850
And that seems to be the main asset of the company.

442
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:50,150
What happened?

443
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:50,770
Not.

444
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:52,110
So, go home.

445
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:55,150
Why are you so bothered?
Aren't you worried?

446
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:57,490
Did you hear what the Chairman just said?

447
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:00,780
And the kids in that lab.

448
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,410
I got hit by it 10 years ago.
- Yes I know.

449
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,620
They are vicious monsters.

450
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:06,870
Even more than that

451
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,830
Shut up.

452
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,790
Clean them up. They started to get in the way.

453
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,590
Very? That's them, right?

454
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,840
They have been following us
since we came to Korea.

455
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:18,720
So?

456
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:19,640
Get it done now.

457
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,720
Wait for a while.

458
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:56,840
What happened?

459
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,880
Seen a local agent?

460
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,220
First of all, let's be calm.

461
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:49,390
Don't make trouble.

462
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,100
I didn't know you were an employee here.

463
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,400
Let's talk first.

464
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,070
Look at me. Hello.
Pleased to meet you.

465
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:01,400
What do you think?

466
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,210
It's just an introduction.

467
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,330
Should you do that?

468
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,150
Enough already.

469
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:36,250
Have your boss come to see me.

470
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,790
Got a ticket, right? There's a bus stop right there.

471
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:40,500
Come back.

472
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,270
If you want to say something, just say it.

473
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:01,940
Captain, do you know their boss?

474
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,030
Very familiar.

475
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:08,570
Can you explain to me?

476
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,240
Of.

477
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,870
That was ten years ago.

478
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,620
So, it's been a long time.

479
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,000
That's really ****

480
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,750
Yes, absolutely *....

481
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:25,710
Why did you say that?

482
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:26,720
What?

483
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:27,970
Who knows.

484
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:28,760
So what?

485
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:30,760
Can you get that out of your mind?

486
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,550
Of.

487
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,980
So, what do my words mean?

488
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:38,640
Women's breasts?

489
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:39,890
What?

490
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:42,440
Swear words again.

491
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,900
Gosh, that's a lot of Korean swear words.

492
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,360
You're trying to disrespect me?

493
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:47,150
Me?

494
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:48,070
Of.

495
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:49,530
Not. Not like that.

496
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:52,410
Maybe it's because you're in a
bad mood, Captain.

497
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:00,540
So, where should we go now?

498
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,630
Wait until it gets a signal.

499
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:05,920
Keep it on until you get a signal.

500
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:09,880
Very primitive.

501
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:12,220
You know how big this island is, right?

502
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:12,930
You did not know?

503
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:13,930
Listen carefully.

504
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:17,140
The area here alone is 1833.2 sq km.

505
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:20,100
It's like looking for a needle in
a haystack.

506
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:23,060
You hear me?

507
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:06,860
My son.

508
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:09,690
Come to mom.

509
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:13,910
Ayo!

510
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,660
Come to mom.

Smells like cow dung.

514
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,940
This place needs to be leveled soon.

515
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,650
What is Kyung-hee?

516
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,120
Long time no see.

517
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:23,740
I'm Uncle Yong-doo.

518
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,290
Remember me, right?

519
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:31,290
Stay there.

520
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,880
Hey, that's...

521
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,010
That's the gun your father used for
hunting, right?

522
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,890
You should have kept it at the police station.

523
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:45,350
You can't just keep it at home.

524
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:46,720
It's illegal.

525
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,980
By the way, you're from the US.

526
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:51,650
America.

527
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:56,320
Anyway, this place is full of weapons, right?

528
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:00,860
But, where is everyone?

529
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,950
Why are you the only one holding that thing?

530
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:05,370
What are you talking about?

531
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:07,450
Are you kidding me?

532
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,370
Four of my men are now half paralyzed.

533
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,120
His life is in danger.

534
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:18,260
My people shouted at the police.

535
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:20,380
This is Uncle. I'm hard to stop.

536
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,680
Hey, Kyung-hee are we outsiders?

537
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:27,720
Family problems should be resolved between families.

538
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,230
There should be no outsiders involved.

539
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,770
That's not a problem, is it?

540
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:35,480
By the way...

541
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:39,940
your dad is amazing.

542
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,610
Didn't I teach you that?

543
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:52,620
Okay.

544
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,980
Well. Now we're out of the way.

545
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:16,860
So say something sincere this time.

546
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:17,980
What to say?

547
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:19,230
There's nothing to
tell you.

548
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:22,030
Now, you have that model.

549
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,740
Shut up.

550
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:27,910
Have you ever shot someone?

551
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:36,580
Advanced.

552
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:39,630
Do not come close.

553
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:41,920
I said don't come any closer.

554
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:42,840
You hear that?

555
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:47,510
Gosh, I'm scared.

556
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,010
Yesterday it.

557
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:50,640
Let me go, you asshole!

558
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,220
Let go of me.

559
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:53,560
Let me go, you asshole!

560
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:55,020
I said let go.

561
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:55,690
Scare me?

562
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:57,610
Feeling great, kid?

563
01:04:58,150 --> 01:04:59,360
You dog!

564
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,860
Who else is this snotty kid?

565
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:03,110
Who are you?

566
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:04,530
Get out of here, you bastard!

567
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:07,780
Don't hurt my sister.

568
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:09,450
Little bastard.

569
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:11,540
Are you good at baseball?

570
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:12,830
Don't hurt him.

571
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:16,000
Don't touch my sister.

572
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:23,010
Boss, there's nobody inside.

573
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:25,470
Really? No one?

574
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:35,430
Looks like Kyung-Hee doesn't take me very seriously
as Uncle.

575
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,770
With this one weapon

576
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:39,440
to get rid of us all?

577
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,110
What nonsense do you keep saying?

578
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,030
Really?

579
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,030
After all, Cheol-ho and I are very loyal.

580
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:54,830
Anyway, that's just the past.
What to do?

581
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,750
So be a good boy and sign the
contract,

582
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,000
or put your fingerprint on it.

583
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:03,550
Not. What exactly do you want to do here?

584
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,050
Do you want to raise cows or sheep?

585
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:08,630
Besides, did I ever ask
you anything?

586
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,760
I'll give you a little more
than the market price.

587
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,100
You can take this money
then go to Seoul.

588
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:18,140
Let's transact and establish relationships.

589
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:21,360
And then stay with
your brother.

590
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:24,440
Now, the two parents are gone.

591
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,280
Now you have to take care of your sister, right?

592
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,400
Zhao Family.

593
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:30,320
I won't give it to you
even if I die.

594
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:32,070
How many times have I told you?

595
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,830
Unlucky.

596
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:37,160
I've told you many times.

597
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:40,000
How can you give
a sincere answer?

598
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:41,830
Why are you so brave?

599
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:43,500
Your father is dead.

600
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:44,840
Look what's happening now.

601
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:45,960
You deny reality?

602
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:47,630
I know.

603
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:49,840
My dad has passed away.

604
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:53,100
You killed him.

605
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,770
You killed my father, dog!

606
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:04,690
I've been patient, but you're still rude to me.

607
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,940
Shut up for me.

608
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,030
It seemed he wanted to be taught a little lesson.

609
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:10,740
He will tell the truth.

610
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:13,410
Make sure the fingerprints remain intact.

611
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,410
Stop beating him, dog!

612
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:19,040
Let go of me.

613
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:21,460
You dog!

614
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,000
Poor child.

615
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:27,210
Not. Not.

616
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,130
Dae-Gil.

617
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:28,880
Stand up.

618
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:29,760
Here.

619
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,180
Stand up, asshole!

620
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:33,760
Here.

621
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:35,930
Rude child.

622
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:41,140
This kid is really annoying.

623
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,650
You want your family beaten for
your energy?

624
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:45,900
Don't move, you asshole.

625
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:47,780
My boss is talking to you.

626
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,070
What do you see?

627
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,160
Gosh, I was really surprised.

628
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:58,490
Who's he?

629
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:01,080
Hey, kid, that's dangerous.

630
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:02,250
Get down.

631
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:04,830
Get down. Be careful you get hurt later.

632
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:05,960
Damn.

633
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,210
How did he get there?

634
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:10,210
Why are the children of today so brave?

635
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:14,430
Hey, crazy girl.

636
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:17,390
That's dangerous. Beware of falling.

637
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:18,970
What is she doing?

638
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:21,350
You guys stop him.
Why just stand there?

639
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:22,980
Hey, come down.

640
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:38,490
What?

641
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:40,370
Acrobatic show?

642
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,550
What is it?

643
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:25,910
Did you see that just now?

644
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:27,330
What's that...

645
01:09:30,130 --> 01:09:32,460
Are you here to visit?

646
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,590
Get him out of here, you idiot!

647
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:44,060
Do not come close.

648
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:46,890
Do not come close.

649
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:48,350
Do not come close.

650
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:51,060
Do not come close.

651
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:07,460
Avoid.

652
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:08,670
Do not come close.

653
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:15,960
Avoid.

654
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,100
Avoid.

655
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:28,100
Avoid.

656
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:35,030
Already.

657
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,440
It's enough.

658
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:42,120
I'm fine.

659
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,370
It's enough.

660
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,630
Get out of here.

661
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:53,790
Do not ever come back.

662
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:55,460
Understand?

663
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:01,300
I will make you go.

664
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,680
Hurry up and treat your hand at the hospital.

665
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:07,100
Hurry up, you bastard!

666
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:13,360
Fine, I'll go.

667
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:15,020
Let's take it off.

668
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,030
Unplug.

669
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:57,570
Sick?
Are you okay?

670
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:00,490
Brother.

671
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:03,860
What is he?

672
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:07,950
What did I just see?

673
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:13,000
Calm yourself for a moment.

674
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:17,460
Actually, I'm not so sure.

675
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:19,710
Look at him.

676
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:20,590
What?

677
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:24,380
Could he be an alien?

678
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:27,140
It's really amazing.

679
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:32,480
What is a scene from a movie?

680
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:34,390
How do you know him, sis?

681
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,150
Extraordinary.

682
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:37,860
It was absolutely amazing.

683
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:39,730
How long will he stay in our house?

684
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:41,940
Can I talk to her?

685
01:12:42,030 --> 01:12:43,280
Putting on YouTube?

686
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,820
Definitely make a lot of money.

687
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:47,320
What is it? What is it?

688
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:48,200
You ...

689
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:50,490
it doesn't matter?

690
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,580
You're all right, aren't you, brat?

691
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:53,910
It hurts.

692
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:56,750
How much is this?

693
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:59,380
That's enough. What's that?

694
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:00,880
Reply me.

695
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,090
Brother, don't do this.

696
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:07,590
Can you introduce me to him again?

697
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,470
Really need to hang out with people
like that. She is amazing.

698
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,470
She is amazing.

699
01:14:56,870 --> 01:14:59,210
See who's coming?

700
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:00,960
Isn't this our Sergeant Zhao?

701
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:02,420
Long time no see.

702
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:06,300
That's okay.

703
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:10,130
Looks like he was thrown somewhere.

704
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:14,050
Seems to have a bit of a conscience.

705
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:17,770
Is it because of faith?

706
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:19,640
Yes, because I also have faith.

707
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,100
And you can't just throw it away.

708
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,350
It will pollute the environment.

709
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,900
We must love the earth.

710
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,570
You look as good as ever.

711
01:15:30,570 --> 01:15:32,240
Still as handsome as ever.

712
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:36,910
You know, you were born with this
kind of thing.

713
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:40,410
You're still beautiful too.

714
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,370
Still have the same sharp eyes.

715
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:46,380
Don't talk about the past.

716
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:47,460
What?

717
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:50,130
That's okay.

718
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:51,420
No need to be leveraged.

719
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,930
Okay, talk about something else then.

720
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:01,100
Why did you suddenly come back?

721
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,600
I thought you wouldn't come back again.

722
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:06,900
You know what you're doing.
Why ask?

723
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,610
Of course I know that it was Chairman Baek
who asked you to come back.

724
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:10,240
But why?

725
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:12,740
What?

726
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:15,030
Is it because of that?

727
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:17,950
That Chairman Baek is getting bigger

728
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:19,120
because it's retired to the second line.

729
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:19,990
Then just stay.

730
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,290
Why are you doing this?

731
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:23,040
Is there a weakness in your heart?

732
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:27,000
Could it be Daiting?

733
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:30,260
Suspect me?

734
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:37,140
Unlucky. Even silent.

735
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:40,140
How dare this damn female ghost doubt me.

736
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,850
That Goo Ja-yoon!

737
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,900
The last person I'm looking for is Doctor Baek, right?

738
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,020
After that, he yawned silently.

739
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,440
You think that's all?

740
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,780
Goo Ja-yoon destroys Hoffen Glass and Bangkok Lab

741
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:56,280
before coming to Jeju Island.

742
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:58,530
And ended up looting the Shanghai lab, you know that, right?

743
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,030
Continued experiment there.

744
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,950
The dolls, they all disappeared.

745
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,620
Plus this time Ark Main was stolen.

746
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:06,330
How dare you doubt me?

747
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,090
Hey, you gotta get out of there.

748
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:15,130
If you're involved with that Daiting,

749
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,260
It's not good for you.

750
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:19,010
I don't care about that group of companies.

751
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:20,890
Or how the fight behind the scenes.

752
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,430
I'll take care of it myself. Move aside.

753
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,560
If you keep telling people to
follow and get in my way,

754
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,150
I will not stay silent.

755
01:17:31,650 --> 01:17:33,650
Geez. You are.

756
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:36,030
You speak passionately.

757
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:40,240
Come on. We don't see each other again.

758
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,790
Let's really part now.

759
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,330
Hi, Ja Yoon.

760
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:45,410
Stupid girl.

761
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,750
We meet after 10 years.

762
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:53,170
Do you really want to go like this?

763
01:17:57,470 --> 01:18:00,260
If not, what do you want?

764
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,430
You want to talk about what happened 10 years ago?

765
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:05,350
Hey, don't.

766
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:07,640
Careful. Let them turn the vehicle.

767
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:13,070
This girl is really annoying.

768
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:18,030
Disgusting girl.

769
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,070
Are we almost there?

770
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:56,940
Near there, right?

771
01:18:58,030 --> 01:19:02,450
Well, it's close. It's a little closer.

772
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:08,700
This island is not as small as I thought.

773
01:19:09,790 --> 01:19:12,670
Boring.

774
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,210
Hey, look at this.

775
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:20,420
Korean Show can be funny, quite interesting.

776
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:23,050
Check it out. See more.

777
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,760
Why do you only know watching it?

778
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:29,640
What is wrong with it? You don't want to die, do you?

779
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:34,480
Shut your mouth or I'll rip it off!

780
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,830
I'm just kidding.

781
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:50,960
I won't argue with him again.

782
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:55,420
Let's fight.

783
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:08,140
We'll see who wins.

784
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,020
What happened?

785
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:14,560
I really fought when I was a kid.

786
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:18,940
Was it only as a child?

787
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:21,900
How?

788
01:20:23,450 --> 01:20:24,610
Play the game.

789
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:34,580
There he is.

790
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:41,630
How can he live?

791
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:44,720
Obviously his brain was killed by a bullet.

792
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:47,510
How did you manage to survive until now?

793
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:53,140
I think it's reasonable to say that you
really died at that stage.

794
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:55,270
Really?

795
01:20:56,940 --> 01:21:00,480
You think I missed it?

796
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:02,400
Not. Not at all.

797
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,700
How could something like that
happen to Big Brother's abilities?

798
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:07,240
I do not mean it.

799
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,120
I just mean....

800
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:30,140
A little fresh meat.

801
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:35,020
Let's reward you for your
cuteness.

802
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,980
That's right.

803
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:45,400
It must be cut completely.

804
01:21:54,370 --> 01:21:55,370
Be patient.

805
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,460
Let's eat. Let's eat.

806
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:02,040
That's good.

807
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,260
Nice?

808
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:08,680
It fell.

809
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:10,680
How about this, Embi?

810
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:12,260
Ayo.

811
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:14,930
What is this?

812
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:17,230
Good grief.

813
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:25,110
What do you want?

814
01:22:56,730 --> 01:22:57,850
Hey, doctor!

815
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:03,690
Old Bastard.

816
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,860
Are you still taking patients?

817
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:08,780
That's cruelty to your animals.

818
01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:10,360
And ...

819
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:12,820
did I mention that
if you dare look at illegal trade,

820
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:14,780
tell anyone I will let you go?

821
01:23:14,780 --> 01:23:17,080
Not. Not like that.

822
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,960
Lately, really

823
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:22,170
only for cats and dogs.

824
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:24,960
It's just prescribing medicine.

825
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:28,840
I can't do surgery anymore.

826
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:29,970
Is that true?

827
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,430
In that case, your hands are of no use.

828
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:43,100
Yong-doo.

829
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:45,940
Not. I mean. Boss Zhao.

830
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,820
Why are you suddenly doing this to me?

831
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:51,070
I won't say anything.

832
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:54,490
Really won't.

833
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:57,740
Shut up. It was noisy.

834
01:23:58,500 --> 01:23:59,660
Shut up.

835
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,960
You must have something to say for me.

836
01:24:03,290 --> 01:24:05,250
What did you say?

837
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,670
The little girl that Kyung Hee brought.

838
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:11,470
Tell me about the girl.

839
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:17,180
You must have something to
tell me.

840
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:19,600
Able to?

841
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:44,160
I think he's the one he's looking for.

842
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:46,080
It seems so.

843
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:47,750
Owner of sustainable key gold.

844
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:48,710
Have you contacted them?

845
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:50,880
Yes, sir, I got a message.

846
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,390
Attract.

847
01:24:58,850 --> 01:25:00,560
Really interesting.

848
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:16,700
Look at this.

849
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:18,410
He's a youtuber.

850
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:23,040
They uploaded a video of eating.

851
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,200
Keep uploading.

852
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:26,210
If someone clicks to watch,

853
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:27,290
and gathered some spectators,

854
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:28,670
then you can receive ads.

855
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,340
If you receive an ad,

856
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:32,300
it can make money.

857
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:34,210
If you have a lot of followers,

858
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:38,260
you can earn millions won per month.

859
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:43,060
You hear me?

860
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:44,270
You heard, right?

861
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:49,310
They make a lot of money
just by eating.

862
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:52,400
You only need to beat him once.

863
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,530
Then, we will definitely be rich.

864
01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:56,950
What's this?

865
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,870
Which one? This one?

866
01:26:00,870 --> 01:26:01,700
Mixed noodles?

867
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:02,870
Nice?

868
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,040
Nice. Pretty good.

869
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,210
Can we eat this?

870
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:13,090
Let's go.

871
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:17,050
Did you hear me?

872
01:26:17,050 --> 01:26:18,220
What's this?

873
01:26:18,430 --> 01:26:19,050
Which one?

874
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:20,640
Itu hot-dog.

875
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:21,930
Next to it, it's pizza.

876
01:26:21,930 --> 01:26:22,760
Nice?

877
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:29,440
Hey, you hear me?

878
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,850
Can we eat this too?

879
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:32,610
You'll be ordered a hot dog later.

880
01:26:32,610 --> 01:26:34,190
You'll be ordered pizza too.

881
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,440
I asked,
did you hear me?

882
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:37,490
What if this one?

883
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:40,860
Are you a food lover?

884
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:42,490
Why are you so greedy?

885
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:45,450
That's enough. Just forget it.

886
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:46,660
Forget it.

887
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:47,500
Forget it.

888
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:19,820
Let's try the abalone porridge.

889
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:22,320
On sale today!

890
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,790
This one is a little hot.

891
01:27:32,170 --> 01:27:34,000
Please eat slowly.

892
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:13,540
Watch your hands get hot.
Eat slowly.

893
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:14,420
Oh God.

894
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:24,430
He's finished eating.

895
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:25,840
All sold out.

896
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:35,810
Hey.

897
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:42,650
Unlucky.

898
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:44,570
Hey, wait.

899
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:53,370
Hello, Uncle.

900
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:03,970
Sorry. It won't be long.

901
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:09,140
Shame on you. Don't eat that.

902
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:11,010
Are there aliens in your stomach?

903
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:14,390
They say I can eat whatever I want.

904
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:15,810
It's okay to eat. But to taste.

905
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:17,770
Is this how it eats on your planet?

906
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,360
Where's my sister?

907
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:37,370
Yes, my sister is at Uncle Dr's veterinary hospital. Ka.

908
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:39,880
Uncle is slightly hurt.

909
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:41,920
Sorry, I went in a hurry.

910
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:45,050
You guys have dinner first.

911
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:46,300
I'll be there soon.

912
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:02,730
Want to drink?

913
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:23,290
Even though it's not very useful now,

914
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:28,630
but still stuck. And that's enough.

915
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:33,140
Kyung Hee,

916
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:35,890
I said the kid...

917
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:43,150
Leave him. Don't be with that child.

918
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:46,690
Before Yong-doo makes trouble.

919
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:47,990
Tell the boy to go.

920
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:51,530
And just give up the land and the house.

921
01:30:55,490 --> 01:30:56,750
Now, go home.

922
01:30:56,870 --> 01:30:59,000
Dae Gil must be waiting for you.

926
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:33,700
Hey.

927
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:38,080
Who are you?

928
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,540
Don't be too scared.

929
01:31:41,290 --> 01:31:42,670
Let's talk to us.

930
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:45,590
Good grief.

931
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:47,590
I've told you so many times, you don't believe me?

932
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:50,920
He can literally fly and throw
cars with his bare hands.

933
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:52,760
I dare you to swear.

934
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,760
She's a girl.

935
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:56,760
What?

936
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:58,310
Who knows.

937
01:31:58,350 --> 01:32:00,850
Maybe 17 or 18 years.

938
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:04,190
Why find out his age?

939
01:32:04,190 --> 01:32:06,020
You want to go on a blind date with him?

940
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:09,190
Didn't I tell you?

941
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:12,360
Just a girl. One.

942
01:32:16,580 --> 01:32:17,330
Okay.

943
01:32:17,330 --> 01:32:20,870
I'll go and buy some guns.

944
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:27,920
Halo.

945
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:31,800
Halo.

946
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:36,390
Halo.

947
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:38,550
What happened?

948
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:42,270
Halo?

949
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,360
Man, that's a new phone.

950
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:53,950
Close the door.

But... Who are you guys?

962
01:33:24,690 --> 01:33:26,480
Still asking who?

963
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:28,100
Your people contacted us.

964
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:35,110
The girl from the group apparently.

965
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:38,240
Even though it's a bit messy,
you should sit down first.

966
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:10,610
Let's talk.

967
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:14,820
Where is the girl now?

968
01:34:19,030 --> 01:34:23,240
If I tell you,
you will kill me, right?

969
01:34:23,330 --> 01:34:24,160
Not.

970
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:25,410
Not?

971
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,750
If you don't tell me,
he will kill you.

972
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:38,420
However, if you tell me soon,
I will stop torturing you and killing you.

973
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:41,180
I will do as
I did to him.

974
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:49,270
Makes you slowly see the organs
in your body in detail.

975
01:34:49,310 --> 01:34:50,650
And then kills you.

976
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:53,650
You've never seen your heart, have you?

977
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:55,900
Never?

978
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:58,690
Yes. Never.

979
01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:02,820
I'm not a cardiac surgeon.

980
01:35:02,830 --> 01:35:05,870
No need to look at that.

981
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:10,000
I can't see it.

982
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:15,750
But...

983
01:35:16,050 --> 01:35:20,010
I think I'll be of use.

984
01:35:20,130 --> 01:35:22,010
I think I can use it.

985
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:25,810
Too bad it killed me right away.

986
01:35:25,810 --> 01:35:27,810
I'm not a troublesome person either.

987
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:31,940
After chatting,

988
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:36,480
we have to figure out what we're betting on.

989
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:37,780
Not like that?

990
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:41,240
Tell me.

991
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:46,330
I will give you a reward, if
you satisfy me.

992
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:52,370
This.

993
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:53,330
This one.

994
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:55,080
Look?

995
01:35:55,590 --> 01:35:58,250
She's a girl from Goo Ja-yoon's village.

996
01:35:58,260 --> 01:36:00,630
In fact, it was the image that made him famous.
Not the song.

997
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:03,340
I don't think you're playing YouTube.

998
01:36:03,470 --> 01:36:06,050
Why don't we dive into this too?

999
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:11,180
If you try, you can become
as popular as Goo Ja Yoon.

1000
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:14,310
Hey, you can't eat if you don't work.

1001
01:36:14,610 --> 01:36:16,310
Moreover, you eat a lot, right?

1002
01:36:16,730 --> 01:36:18,610
But I never sing.

1003
01:36:18,730 --> 01:36:21,150
Good grief.

1004
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:25,030
Try to go to the practice hall and
train hard for a few days.

1005
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,530
From just...

1006
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:30,870
breaking people's joints and
throwing cars,

1007
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:32,200
do you know to do anything else?

1008
01:36:32,330 --> 01:36:35,330
Like him. Softer.

1009
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:38,090
Do something.

1010
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:40,590
I'll give you pizza.

1011
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:43,220
It will be bigger than before.

1012
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:44,590
Big?

1013
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:47,260
Can I order fried chicken as a side dish?

1014
01:36:47,890 --> 01:36:48,800
Spaghetti too.

1015
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:50,390
Spaghetti?

1016
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:07,240
What is your specialty?

1017
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:14,830
Not. Don't smile.

1018
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:16,790
If you smile like that...

1019
01:37:18,670 --> 01:37:22,300
Good grief. Very sweet.

1020
01:37:25,970 --> 01:37:27,680
No, no.

1021
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:29,680
Don't smile.

1022
01:37:29,850 --> 01:37:31,260
What are you doing?

1023
01:37:32,970 --> 01:37:34,980
Do not do it.

1024
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:38,850
It's like this, right?

1025
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:04,090
Are you kidding?

1026
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:05,170
Right?

1027
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:07,170
Hey don't do that.

1028
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:09,180
Let me take a good look.

1029
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:10,850
Try. Try again.

1030
01:38:10,850 --> 01:38:13,010
Try one more time.
I want to see.

1031
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:14,520
Try.

1032
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:23,440
What?

1033
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:27,860
That's really cool.

1034
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:32,240
You're amazing.

1035
01:38:32,530 --> 01:38:35,370
How did you do it?

1036
01:38:36,370 --> 01:38:37,580
Wait a minute.

1037
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:39,080
Don't unplug the antenna.

1038
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:40,620
Do not unplug the antenna.

1039
01:38:40,710 --> 01:38:41,790
I still want to watch TV!

1040
01:38:42,590 --> 01:38:43,790
Take it down. Yes. Take it down.

1041
01:38:47,670 --> 01:38:48,670
Keren.

1042
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:49,930
This is crazy.

1043
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:51,720
It was incredible.

1044
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:56,770
You're the one who just dropped the
star too?

1045
01:38:57,350 --> 01:38:59,600
Could it be that crazy?

1046
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:02,860
Not apparently.

1047
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:07,820
But, where did you learn that?

1048
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:10,200
You're very talented.

1049
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:44,610
It really is that kid.

1050
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:46,610
What have you seen?

1051
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:05,630
He's a monster. I don't know when he will mutate.

1052
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:09,130
If you don't want your sister to die,

1053
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:12,220
just listen to what i have to say.

1054
01:40:25,190 --> 01:40:26,310
Time for everyone to watch.

1055
01:40:26,730 --> 01:40:28,770
Fireworks 30 minutes away.

1056
01:40:30,030 --> 01:40:31,490
If not handled properly during this time

1057
01:40:31,610 --> 01:40:33,490
The noise will attract the attention of
the police or the public.

1058
01:40:33,490 --> 01:40:34,990
Which will complicate things.

1059
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:36,160
Ayo.

1060
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:38,280
But, Captain.

1061
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:40,540
If only his sister was taken out,

1062
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:41,910
will the girl find it strange?

1063
01:40:42,830 --> 01:40:44,370
What if he took her on a run?

1064
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:46,960
I can only pray that he doesn't
notice even for a few minutes.

1065
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:51,510
Why don't you go?

1066
01:40:52,090 --> 01:40:53,260
I want to protect you, Captain.

1067
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:54,840
Nonsense.

1068
01:40:54,930 --> 01:40:56,090
Who protects whom?

1069
01:40:56,340 --> 01:40:57,390
No need. Go.

1070
01:40:58,390 --> 01:40:58,930
Captain.

1071
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:00,760
Captain.

1072
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:02,560
Captain, let me be with you.

1073
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:20,580
Put the sticky rice balls on the rice and eat in one big bite.

1074
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:26,790
What's that?

1075
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:29,080
Good grief.

1076
01:41:29,630 --> 01:41:31,000
Very funny.

1077
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:51,900
Can he find it, captain?

1078
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:56,860
Didn't I tell you not to speak
in my ear?

1079
01:41:57,410 --> 01:41:58,950
Swearing again.

1080
01:41:59,950 --> 01:42:01,030
The policy of the slanderer.

1081
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:04,240
Unlucky.

1082
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:06,250
I really want to kill you.

1083
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:08,960
Speaking of fireworks,

1084
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:10,380
there is a fireworks festival today.

1085
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:11,500
What's the time now?

1086
01:42:11,630 --> 01:42:13,050
It is such a coincidence.

1087
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:15,380
Let's go out.

1088
01:42:19,010 --> 01:42:19,970
Firework?

1089
01:42:19,970 --> 01:42:21,510
It was very beautiful.

1090
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:23,260
You don't know that? Your planet
has no fireworks?

1091
01:42:23,510 --> 01:42:26,810
Let's go have a look.

1092
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:27,730
Brother, want to come?

1093
01:42:27,730 --> 01:42:29,190
Dae-Gil.

1094
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:31,480
What is it?

1095
01:42:31,940 --> 01:42:36,400
Release his hand.

1096
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:38,200
It came out right away. Get ready.

1097
01:42:38,490 --> 01:42:41,160
When you see them out,
find a safe distance and shoot.

1098
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:43,330
Ready, captain.

1099
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:50,040
Brother, what's wrong with you?

1100
01:42:50,710 --> 01:42:52,040
Run away.

1101
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:54,040
What are you saying this?

1102
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:56,050
Forgive me.

1103
01:42:58,090 --> 01:42:59,760
Run fast.

1104
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:05,560
He will go.

1105
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:12,230
What are those people doing?

1106
01:43:39,010 --> 01:43:40,170
Captain, look back there.

1107
01:43:40,550 --> 01:43:42,550
They're from the Shanghai Research Lab, right?

1108
01:43:51,730 --> 01:43:52,940
Who are you guys?

1109
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:55,270
I told you not to come here.
Why are you guys here again?

1110
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:56,940
Ya benar.

1111
01:43:57,690 --> 01:44:00,240
Kyung-hee we take the long stick again.

1112
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:01,950
But we also have.

1113
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:03,360
Can you see what
's in there?

1114
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:04,780
He goes to the roof.

1115
01:44:05,070 --> 01:44:06,410
But the boy was also with him.

1116
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:08,410
Unlucky.

1117
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:09,910
Keep your distance.

1118
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:12,580
Ayo.

1119
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:15,080
You saw that, right?
Its over there.

1120
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:16,840
That's the highway.

1121
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:18,840
You can be there in an instant, right?

1122
01:44:19,050 --> 01:44:20,210
Go!

1123
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:22,470
I will see my sister.
You go now.

1124
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:26,470
Oh yes.

1125
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:28,430
You're coming back, right?

1126
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,680
Come back when everything is fine.

1127
01:44:30,810 --> 01:44:31,810
We're going to the karaoke building.

1128
01:44:31,810 --> 01:44:33,060
I will order pizza for you every day.

1129
01:44:33,190 --> 01:44:35,060
We have to meet again.

1130
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:42,070
Where is the girl?

1131
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:45,360
Who? what girl?

1132
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:47,370
Rude woman.

1133
01:44:47,370 --> 01:44:48,070
What?

1134
01:44:48,780 --> 01:44:50,660
Okay. Die you.

1135
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:55,920
Brother.

1136
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:22,480
Brother.

1137
01:45:23,110 --> 01:45:27,700
Older brother. Not.

1138
01:45:27,820 --> 01:45:29,820
Brother.

1139
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:34,330
Did you find something?

1140
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:35,960
Nothing, Captain.

1141
01:45:36,210 --> 01:45:37,750
Could it be destroyed by two missiles?

1142
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:40,040
Nothing too?

1143
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:41,290
Not.

1144
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:42,090
But...

1145
01:45:42,090 --> 01:45:42,710
But what?

1146
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:43,670
There's something else.

1147
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,520
Brother.

1148
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:25,770
I'm so sick of your family.

1149
01:47:26,110 --> 01:47:31,070
I'm sick and tired of having kids like that.

1150
01:47:31,780 --> 01:47:34,700
I'll kill you, Yong-Doo, you bastard.

1151
01:47:34,990 --> 01:47:39,040
I'll kill you with my own hands, damn it.

1152
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:43,330
Why apologize to you?

1153
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:46,130
Because I killed your father?

1154
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:49,460
Do you know why your father died?

1155
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:52,260
He wanted to kill me, but
he died.

1156
01:47:52,260 --> 01:47:53,300
Do you know.

1157
01:47:54,390 --> 01:47:58,350
I have been faithful
for 15 years.

1158
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:03,520
Did you know that I
got all this land with my body?

1159
01:48:03,770 --> 01:48:04,900
You don't know that?

1160
01:48:08,110 --> 01:48:10,990
What am I talking about with
a runny kid?

1161
01:48:11,450 --> 01:48:14,570
Come on. Follow your brother too.

1162
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:18,450
Hey, crazy ground bastard!

1163
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:21,080
Go before I get angry.

1164
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:23,080
It's not your turn for this kind of event.

1165
01:48:24,670 --> 01:48:25,670
What?

1166
01:48:26,170 --> 01:48:27,170
as you like?

1167
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:30,420
How can you decide for yourself?

1168
01:48:31,050 --> 01:48:33,420
Why are you ruining my fun?

1169
01:49:08,590 --> 01:49:10,500
Gosh, Captain, did you see that?

1170
01:49:10,590 --> 01:49:11,960
He is not in the person of his equal.

1171
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:12,800
Hurry up and shoot, idiot.

1172
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,800
Unlucky.

1173
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:40,640
Die you.

1174
01:50:59,660 --> 01:51:00,570
Two.

1175
01:51:01,870 --> 01:51:03,240
Run!

1176
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:04,410
Run fast!

1177
01:51:04,410 --> 01:51:06,990
Where are you running, you bastard?

1178
01:51:07,450 --> 01:51:10,750
Don't piss me off. Die you.

1179
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:17,420
Captain, again?

1180
01:51:19,930 --> 01:51:21,800
Man, this is a new model.

1181
01:51:22,340 --> 01:51:23,590
Damn.

1182
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:25,930
That's how you always protect me.

1183
01:51:26,270 --> 01:51:27,520
Do not touch.

1184
01:51:28,270 --> 01:51:30,310
This is a new product.

1185
01:51:37,650 --> 01:51:38,400
Hey.

1186
01:53:48,030 --> 01:53:51,280
You seem!

1187
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:55,410
Very weird.

1188
01:53:56,830 --> 01:54:00,000
Obviously I smashed your head.

1189
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:03,050
How did you survive?

1190
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:14,680
I will behead you this time.

1191
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:43,540
Captain.

1192
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:44,710
What about the kid?

1193
01:54:50,550 --> 01:54:51,300
Captain, what are you going to do?

1194
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:53,260
Captain, he's a commoner.

1195
01:56:08,840 --> 01:56:09,710
How lucky.

1196
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:11,170
I'm scared.

1197
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:12,880
I see it.

1198
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:15,590
You didn't pee yourself, did you?

1199
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:25,900
Damn, those monsters!

1200
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:31,940
Surprisingly enough.

1201
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:34,200
Not the same as before?

1202
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:37,450
It's also a bad variety.

1203
01:57:12,190 --> 01:57:13,900
How about that one?

1204
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:40,430
Of.

1205
01:57:43,430 --> 01:57:44,520
That hurts.

1206
01:57:45,190 --> 01:57:48,310
But what good is this for us?

1207
01:58:35,150 --> 01:58:36,570
What's the situation?

1208
01:58:38,740 --> 01:58:42,240
He didn't even talk to us!

1209
01:59:07,770 --> 01:59:09,270
Really alive?

1210
01:59:10,100 --> 01:59:11,310
But...

1211
01:59:11,310 --> 01:59:13,150
Both then and now,

1212
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:17,030
He doesn't look that great.

1213
01:59:18,530 --> 01:59:20,150
He is actually ...

1214
01:59:21,030 --> 01:59:22,360
no nothing.

02:03:55,350 --> 02:03:55,890
You.

1219
02:03:56,430 --> 02:03:57,680
Finally.

1220
02:04:12,150 --> 02:04:13,610
Long time no see.

1221
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:16,570
Don't play with me.

1222
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:33,260
Do you guys know each other?

1223
02:04:34,840 --> 02:04:36,840
Very.

1224
02:04:37,850 --> 02:04:38,850
How could that be?

1225
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:45,350
He was born left alone in Ark Main.

1226
02:04:47,230 --> 02:04:48,400
She's my sister.

1227
02:04:49,610 --> 02:04:51,780
I ask you to let go of my sister.

1228
02:04:52,110 --> 02:04:53,610
Who told you to kill him?

1229
02:04:53,740 --> 02:04:54,610
Jo-hyeon.

1230
02:05:13,510 --> 02:05:16,090
They?

1231
02:05:17,720 --> 02:05:20,100
I asked them to look for you.

1232
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:21,810
People from Shanghai, China.

1233
02:05:26,900 --> 02:05:29,270
I was a little hurt that time.

1234
02:05:29,270 --> 02:05:32,230
I can't handle it if you mess up.

1235
02:05:33,400 --> 02:05:35,070
So I rely on them.

1236
02:05:36,860 --> 02:05:41,740
But, at first I wasn't sure it was you.

1237
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:44,660
You are bothered by them.

1238
02:05:48,330 --> 02:05:50,750
My sister is not like that.

1239
02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:55,300
So, I don't think you were planning on leaving.

1240
02:05:58,970 --> 02:06:00,430
But here.

1241
02:06:02,010 --> 02:06:03,640
Your feelings.

1242
02:06:06,350 --> 02:06:09,940
Suddenly feels a little rusty, right?

1243
02:06:11,070 --> 02:06:14,440
Yes, we are only together when we
are in mother's tummy.

1244
02:06:14,570 --> 02:06:16,900
Separated at birth.

1245
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:21,780
Did you just free me?

1246
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:24,200
Of.

1247
02:06:24,540 --> 02:06:25,500
Why?

1248
02:06:26,080 --> 02:06:27,500
Because I need you.

1249
02:06:30,330 --> 02:06:32,420
You need me too.

1250
02:06:33,380 --> 02:06:35,130
Then why?

1251
02:06:38,300 --> 02:06:40,220
Want to know what mom said

1252
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:44,720
What did I hear...

1253
02:06:45,890 --> 02:06:48,560
You are connected to your mother's consciousness.

1254
02:06:49,350 --> 02:06:51,150
Mother has been looking for you.

1255
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:54,020
He's not looking for me.

1256
02:07:05,450 --> 02:07:07,250
Come with your sister.

1257
02:07:19,470 --> 02:07:23,340
You're too cold to treat
your brother you haven't seen in a long time?

1258
02:07:41,030 --> 02:07:45,070
Are you hurt?

1259
02:07:45,870 --> 02:07:48,450
Do you know what that feels like?

1260
02:07:48,790 --> 02:07:50,450
I want to save them.

1261
02:07:52,830 --> 02:07:54,500
It could have been done.

1262
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:58,210
But you can't save both of them.

1263
02:07:59,460 --> 02:08:01,050
Make your choice.

1264
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:06,260
Whoever it was,
no one could be an ordinary human.

1265
02:08:07,060 --> 02:08:08,560
It doesn't matter?

1266
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:38,790
Isn't it better to die as a human being?

1267
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:21,130
Let's go to mother's place, my sister!

1268
02:10:30,120 --> 02:10:33,700
The children finally met.

1269
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:39,040
Soon they will come to their mother.

1270
02:10:44,460 --> 02:10:49,300
What's the picture like?

1271
02:10:53,720 --> 02:10:59,350
Then, let's prepare too.

1272
02:11:14,350 --> 02:12:09,350
I'm tiring too

1273
02:11:21,370 --> 02:11:28,420
Don't move.
There is still a surprise at the end of the film!

02:14:41,660 --> 02:14:44,660
Almost suffocated.

1277
02:14:47,370 --> 02:14:48,580
They are gone.

1278
02:14:48,750 --> 02:14:50,040
They go.

1279
02:14:52,290 --> 02:14:52,920
Captain.

1280
02:14:54,590 --> 02:14:56,050
Captain, they're gone.

1281
02:14:58,470 --> 02:14:59,930
Captain, they're gone.

1282
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:03,640
Captain.

1283
02:15:05,930 --> 02:15:07,640
Captain.

1284
02:15:10,690 --> 02:15:12,730
Captain.

1285
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:14,400
Captain, wake up!

1286
02:15:14,570 --> 02:15:16,070
Captain, can you hear me?

1287
02:15:16,650 --> 02:15:17,480
Captain!

1288
02:15:18,110 --> 02:15:20,570
What if you die like that?

1289
02:15:20,820 --> 02:15:21,490
Damn.

1290
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:32,460
Hearing your voice, the monsters are
still coming to us.

1291
02:15:40,010 --> 02:15:41,220
The children were taken away.

1292
02:15:43,430 --> 02:15:44,890
What are you waiting for?

1293
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:46,560
Help me get up.

1294
02:15:53,150 --> 02:15:54,060
Let's go.

1295
02:15:54,150 --> 02:15:55,520
We have to catch them fast.

1296
02:15:57,110 --> 02:15:58,360
Give me your phone.

1297
02:16:26,470 --> 02:16:28,390
You remember my cell phone number.

1298
02:16:29,390 --> 02:16:31,430
What is it?

1299
02:16:31,770 --> 02:16:33,440
Didn't you say you
'd never see each other again?

1300
02:16:33,730 --> 02:16:35,940
Since when were you there?

1301
02:16:36,520 --> 02:16:38,730
What is the importance of that? Straight to the point.

1302
02:16:39,570 --> 02:16:40,730
Of.

1303
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:43,400
Never want to meet again.

1304
02:16:43,820 --> 02:16:47,950
But the situation does not allow.
Please help us.

1305
02:16:48,330 --> 02:16:51,370
Why help you?
Don't you suspect me?

1306
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:54,040
Damn you cheap!

1307
02:16:54,670 --> 02:16:57,210
Do you still have to calculate this?

1308
02:16:57,420 --> 02:16:59,210
Then you have to understand too.

1309
02:16:59,460 --> 02:17:00,880
So what do you want me to do?

1310
02:17:01,130 --> 02:17:02,880
Damn it!

1311
02:17:03,300 --> 02:17:05,590
Are you going to keep chatting like this?

1312
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:08,390
Why don't you catch those guys, idiot?

1313
02:17:09,680 --> 02:17:12,270
Geez, my new phone.

1314
02:17:18,020 --> 02:17:19,520
Don't worry.

1315
02:17:20,320 --> 02:17:23,490
I know where they went.
