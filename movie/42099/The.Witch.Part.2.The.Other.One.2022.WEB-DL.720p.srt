1
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,240
child

2
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,030
come to me

3
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,830
come to mom

4
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,960
hurry up

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
come to me

6
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,090
baby come to me

7
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,060
everyone sing

8
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,150
Love each other, friends, don't hate friends

9
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,690
only one life

10
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,990
Let's go on a voyage

11
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,660
love it friend

12
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,450
be happy, my friend

13
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,250
Is the tape stuck?

14
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,750
Do you want me to unravel it for you?

15
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,920
no need

16
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,250
I'll do it in a while

17
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,170
Or use MP3

18
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,840
Who still listens to the Walkman now?

19
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,680
It's all going to be broken by you.

20
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,640
try this

21
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,050
delicious

22
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,430
delicious

23
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,640
good to eat

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,430
delicious

25
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,100
that

26
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,520
what did you do last night

27
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,770
why are you sleeping

28
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,280
Hey

29
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,200
Did you sleep with Jae Hyun last night?

30
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,950
is not it

31
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,360
what to say

32
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,120
I was right

33
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,780
say no

34
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,500
look in my eyes

35
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,080
definitely did

36
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
do not talk

37
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,460
I know I won't say it

38
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,760
happy

39
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,550
all night - really

40
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,680
I really don't talk

41
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,180
really don't say

42
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,880
don't care don't

43
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,300
That guy has been like that since the beginning

44
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,140
that pervert

45
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,920
where is this

46
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,340
my neck

47
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,560
Have you gone the wrong way - where is this?

48
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,070
where is this

49
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,160
It doesn't feel like it's here

50
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,660
Nothing at all

51
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,120
Is the director here?

52
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,570
The sightseeing bus fell under the bridge

53
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:56,830
Bodies found one after another in damaged bus

54
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:04,790
The windows have been shattered and there are luggage and vehicle wreckage everywhere

55
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,010
The condition of the damaged vehicle can be seen at the time of the accident

56
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,100
A bus that fell from a twenty-one-meter-high cliff

57
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,060
It's been damaged beyond recognition

58
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:25,770
Thirty-six employees of the group building of the company were in the car

59
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,820
When the bus goes downhill

60
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,160
Hit the guardrail and fell into the river

61
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,040
This is because the slope of the slope is too steep

62
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,580
woke up too early

63
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,540
do not be afraid

64
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,340
nothing will happen

65
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,220
my my child

66
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,010
I have a baby in my belly

67
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,770
I know

68
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,770
is a girl

69
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,350
This kid will have a brother

70
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,230
will be twins

71
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:14,150
The twins will also have numerous siblings

72
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,500
we will make it

73
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,840
what do you mean

74
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,930
Girl it looks like you really don't know who you are

75
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,270
Or are you pretending it?

76
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,400
It's ok

77
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,360
you may not know

78
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,360
we are with you

79
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,920
Auntie lives in a good place

80
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,740
really not bad

81
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,550
what is that

82
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,090
Where did that come from?

83
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,740
It's like this when you come to the old lady's house

84
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
general manager

85
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,670
The view here is really great

86
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,470
How did you find this place

87
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,640
I should have come over more often to say hello

88
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,980
I shouldn't have seen you for so long

89
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,310
You must be busy with so many new jobs

90
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,310
It's ok

91
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,360
I drew so many pictures

92
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,950
This is all drawn by you, the chief executive, right?

93
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,740
Why don't you have a solo exhibition?

94
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,120
It's a pity to leave ashes like that.

95
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,370
I heard there was an accident in the lab

96
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,300
Yes this morning

97
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,170
You speak too candidly

98
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,140
Could it be something wrong with the headquarters?

99
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,100
Yes

100
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,310
Something went wrong at the lab headquarters

101
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,270
no

102
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,400
not a small problem

103
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,280
It was the headquarters that was breached

104
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,120
Talking about these headaches to you who are taking a back seat

105
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,580
It's really inappropriate

106
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,620
but you used to be in charge

107
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,460
Some things still need to be known

108
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,710
who will do it

109
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:40,710
It won't be related to the problems of the previous generation, right?

110
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,590
how do you know

111
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,550
Chief, your bad taste is still the same as always.

112
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,140
you are right

113
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:59,070
After this group of garbage destroyed the laboratory, it was scattered all over the place.

114
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,910
Chief, aren't you curious about that?

115
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,620
who put those dolls out

116
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,790
what's their purpose

117
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,800
Only a few people inside the consortium know about the existence of the laboratory

118
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,510
There are only two organizations I can think of right now

119
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,930
transhumanist organization

120
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,140
And the alliance

121
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,600
so not on our side

122
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,480
It's on your side, the chief executive.

123
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,310
right

124
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:51,450
Anyone who investigates will find out right away.

125
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,120
no

126
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,250
We don't have time to take a slow look at our current situation

127
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,880
Although broken

128
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,630
But from our standpoint

129
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,970
It is broken from the inside, not from the outside

130
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,470
what do you mean

131
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,220
Yes

132
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,400
that child is lost

133
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,570
Not abandoned but lost?

134
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:30,200
yes lost

135
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,330
went out by himself

136
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,130
it's over

137
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,190
what's the matter with you

138
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,230
where are you going

139
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,360
Want to give you a ride

140
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,700
Why don't you answer when you ask questions?

141
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,950
What are you doing, get in the car

142
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,970
what are you doing

143
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,060
what are you gonna do

144
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,850
She has nothing to do with this, why bring her

145
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,520
are you a humanitarian

146
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,650
Now is not the time to worry about others

147
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,150
We might bury you

148
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,110
how to leave witnesses

149
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,580
We are very strict

150
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,040
How can she be so virtuous

151
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:09,000
Is the blood on her real?

152
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,460
Brother seems to be blood

153
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,130
what is she doing

154
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,760
Stop playing and let her go

155
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,470
she sees nothing

156
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,810
you are so noisy

157
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,430
she saw the car

158
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,390
I must have seen the license plate number.

159
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,310
stop bullshitting

160
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,230
Can you see it instead?

161
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,650
Not always

162
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,940
41 River 0115

163
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,990
did you really see it

164
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,870
how did you see

165
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,500
what else did you see

166
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,460
010－7562－3905

167
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,000
No. 702, Building 309, Zhushi Building

168
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,510
It doesn't matter, big brother, this is a set car

169
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,520
who are you

170
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,190
live here

171
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,280
The stinky boy asks you something

172
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,110
what are you doing

173
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,030
Stop playing and let her go

174
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,910
Shut up, stinky lady

175
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,750
Visit MovieHAB.com

176
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,580
you bastards

177
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,540
Don't bully innocent children

178
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:39,510
Smelly lady shut up and give me some peace

179
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,550
what the hell are you doing

180
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,890
how is this virtuous

181
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,220
Be honest with me, little brat

182
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,470
open

183
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,770
what the hell is this girl doing

184
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:54,690
open

185
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,070
Not the lunatic who lives here

186
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,070
Dude seems really crazy

187
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,570
right

188
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,580
Is she wearing a mental hospital outfit?

189
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,330
let me go

190
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,480
don't want

191
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,900
stop

192
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,910
do not do that

193
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,540
no more

194
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,560
Hello, this is 119, what help do you need?

195
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,820
please speak

196
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,440
Hey

197
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,870
Is there a problem

198
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,870
please speak

199
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,580
Hey

200
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,660
Hello

201
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,590
We'll send someone over, please don't hang up

202
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,470
follow me

203
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,080
uh uncle

204
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,580
Just a short walk from there

205
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,250
An ambulance passed in front of me just now

206
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,050
It's not that way, it's the second way

207
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:13,260
Hmm, that seems to be the one

208
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,510
wait a minute i'm out

209
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,600
uncle

210
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,110
uncle

211
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,740
It's not Kyung Hee, who did this?

212
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,500
Is Long Dou that bastard again?

213
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,670
Uncle, we have to hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

214
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,500
walk

215
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,630
But who is she

216
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,000
that

217
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,720
Seems to be seriously injured

218
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,680
nosebleed

219
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,050
that that

220
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,140
child

221
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,020
child

222
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,810
i really am

223
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,560
uncle fast

224
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,310
what is this

225
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:04,900
are you okay

226
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,190
Get in the car now

227
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:07,860
well

228
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,470
Really are

229
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:39,970
Kyunghee

230
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:40,550
Um

231
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:47,060
how are you feeling

232
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,480
I'm fine

233
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,820
But Long Dou is a bastard

234
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,650
Now blatantly killing people

235
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,860
That bastard should have a grudge

236
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,490
How long has your dad been dead?

237
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:04,080
Haven't taken that land yet

238
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,000
Resort bid is already in sight

239
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,250
words like that

240
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,170
Competitors are also to those shareholders

241
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,630
No face in front of them

242
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,880
how is that kid

243
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,850
That's what she said

244
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,440
It's that kind of weird

245
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:35,780
It doesn't feel so strange

246
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,820
what

247
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,160
Shouldn't it be fine?

248
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:46,040
No matter how amateur this uncle is

249
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,210
I used to be the one who flew all over the street.

250
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:53,920
I used this hand to save your dad many times when I was a kid

251
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:01,550
But don't you need to call the police?

252
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,930
Her wounds are also unusual

253
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,440
I always feel like a girl with a story

254
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:21,610
So I'm more afraid of calling the police

255
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,070
That's true

256
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:26,990
It doesn't do us any good to have dealings with the police.

257
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,660
And it's hard to explain

258
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:38,300
During this time, I will take care of her until her injury improves.

259
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,510
Well just do that

260
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,930
Captain, are you all right?

261
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,090
Why are there gunshots again?

262
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,220
Gan scare me this bastard

263
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,480
I can hear you speak softly

264
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,520
How many times have you said that you dog Keiko

265
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,270
How good are the headphones now?

266
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,110
I'm smoking now

267
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,280
Call the cleaners in and clean up

268
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:15,450
not captain

269
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,700
do you do this every time

270
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,040
Acting alone like this will really kill you

271
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,420
do you want to die

272
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,710
why didn't you wait for me

273
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,090
Do you have to act alone without backup every time?

274
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,760
Then you can't hurry up, kid

275
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,930
Shouldn't it be dealt with before the regular believers come?

276
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:31,890
what

277
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,890
Isn't that the gathering time you gave, Captain?

278
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,520
Shut up and drive your car

279
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,020
No, this bastard is so noisy

280
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,770
what to say

281
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,230
Are you scolding me now

282
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:43,900
Are you scolding me, why are you suddenly using Korean?

283
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,320
What's wrong with Koreans speaking Korean?

284
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,990
didn't say anything just said you were noisy

285
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,490
Why are you still holding that manual?

286
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,740
Where's the tablet I bought for you?

287
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,160
Never mind I like the analog age

288
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,460
I don't like front-end stuff

289
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,750
Then give that back to me if you don't need it

290
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,960
That's the latest

291
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,300
this bastard really is

292
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,510
You are so childish, you gave it to me, and I want to go back

293
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,260
And I am using

294
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,930
Where is it used I haven't seen you use it

295
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,680
What happened to Netflix when lying down before going to bed?

296
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,440
Use such an expensive thing to brush Netflix

297
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,770
Is it okay to use it for his purpose?

298
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,190
Shut up and go, asshole

299
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,320
I can't believe this dog is really

300
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,490
did you do it on purpose

301
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,370
dog Keiko

302
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,330
Is that dirty talk?

303
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,330
swear words

304
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,000
yes it's dirty words

305
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,750
scold me again

306
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:42,710
Yet again

307
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,870
Gan slams on the accelerator again

308
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,380
You're such a dirty talker

309
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:09,600
Hey I told you don't drink it to your mouth

310
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,930
what to do with the cup

311
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:15,310
It should be used when my sister is drinking.

312
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,520
kid

313
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:21,990
why do you look like this

314
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,780
Is it that boy Long Dou?

315
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,040
it doesn't matter

316
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:37,920
He is my brother brother brother

317
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,500
no problem, no problem

318
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,460
don't do that

319
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,510
let go of my boy

320
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,760
you boy

321
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:48,930
It looks fine

322
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,220
But who is she

323
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:57,810
It's my sister, the sister I know

324
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,650
Will be staying at our house soon

325
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,280
How long have you been in Korea

326
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,990
Have you met a sister so soon?

327
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,700
I didn't realize that you were a social cow.

328
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,240
It's just a social cow

329
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:22,170
Did the boy eat?

330
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,340
prepare dinner for you too

331
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:30,470
rude boy

332
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,650
Going to prepare dinner

333
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,750
what's wrong?

334
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,590
It's not that I don't have an appetite, it's not delicious

335
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:09,130
This kid is really

336
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,010
Then don't eat it, boy

337
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,350
Even if it doesn't taste good, you still put the food in your mouth.

338
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,020
Is it because of the taste?

339
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,020
just eat hard to survive

340
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,690
I'm really this kid

341
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,980
pain

342
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,940
Of course it hurts you to beat your boy

343
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:28,990
You kid has been to your sister recently

344
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:29,820
talk back boy

345
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,700
step on the nose

346
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,490
I said it hurts don't do this

347
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,660
do not do that

348
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,450
why not

349
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,660
Can't you say bad food?

350
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,620
Just warm up the quick meal

351
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,290
Soup is also bought in the supermarket

352
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:44,250
you need to be cleaned up today

353
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,920
you rude boy

354
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,420
don't talk back boy

355
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,470
don't do this what are you doing

356
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,130
let go boy

357
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:50,970
I said don't do it

358
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:51,510
let go boy

359
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:52,510
I said don't do it

360
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,230
you are now

361
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,150
did you just push me

362
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,440
I asked if you had pounced on your sister

363
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,320
really annoying

364
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,150
what

365
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,280
When did you say you hate this house and run out?

366
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,450
came back after my father died

367
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,410
What do you say every day, sister

368
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,620
you know how funny you are

369
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,950
Obviously you said you hated running away from this house

370
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,120
I said I didn't want to see my father and left.

371
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,870
our dad's place

372
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,210
When did you care so much about dad?

373
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,340
When did this start to be your home?

374
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:17,760
This is the room where I lived as a child

375
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,810
you live

376
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:43,500
Visit MovieHAB.com to support us

377
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,540
should be about the same

378
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:48,630
you wear it

379
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,880
Put on comfortable clothes and sleep

380
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,430
then rest

381
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:01,220
Let me know if you need it

382
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:08,940
that

383
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:14,110
i forgot to thank you

384
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:16,650
Thank you

385
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,200
I survived thanks to you

386
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,130
have a rest

387
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:41,140
rest

388
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:15,710
Subject's official name is Laboratory Data Point

389
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:19,760
On the record, it is written as ADP for convenience

390
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:22,470
is going to be an advancement for more than 40 years

391
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,720
Benchmarks for this project for kids

392
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:44,280
That's what my sister and the transhumanists wanted

393
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:45,830
full model

394
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:52,170
Those who successfully recovered the body they were looking for a long time ago

395
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,460
Separate the crystals that grow in the body

396
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:57,510
try to copy

397
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,930
One of them is this kid

398
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:16,070
What is Goo Ja Yoon's whereabouts still unknown?

399
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:17,530
I only know that after leaving here

400
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,030
Appeared in the last lab last month

401
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:26,740
The manager let go of the child he found

402
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:29,200
It actually surprised me a bit

403
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:37,500
She is stronger than I expected

404
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,630
But Zi Yun was also traumatized here.

405
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:46,180
So it should be impossible to act for a while

406
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:50,560
And she has weaknesses

407
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:54,100
Her brain needs to be drug dependent

408
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,150
She alone can't do us much power

409
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:59,480
But this kid is different, right?

410
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,240
I don't know what kind of monster

411
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:11,080
This is always overflowing in this world

412
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,710
must be removed

413
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,630
If this agency knew

414
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,300
Either the manager or I will be screwed

415
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:29,600
Probably will break our brains apart

416
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,220
used as experimental base

417
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:36,310
understand what you mean

418
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:40,570
Just use this to pay off my 10-year-old debt.

419
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,650
I'm leaving

420
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:50,950
Just in case there are chips implanted in lab kids

421
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,540
brain state

422
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:53,540
There is also a location

423
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:56,960
will help you find her

424
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,670
But this one seems broken

425
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,380
how to use

426
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,510
would you use this

427
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:09,760
what

428
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:11,430
That's almost broken

429
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:13,770
stop licking

430
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,020
dirty

431
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,440
Captain but can we do this

432
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:27,110
I mean

433
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,160
The performance is not good, and he still engages in non-formal activities

434
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:35,450
And that thing seems to be the main asset of the company

435
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:36,750
what's wrong

436
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:37,370
No

437
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:38,710
then you go home

438
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:41,750
Oh, why are you so disgusted? Don't you worry?

439
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:44,090
Did you hear what Mr. Bai just said?

440
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,380
And the kids in the lab

441
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:49,010
I contacted 10 years ago I know

442
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,220
they are cruel monsters

443
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:53,470
not even that

444
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:55,430
Do not talk nonsense

445
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:58,390
Grab them, they're getting in the way

446
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,190
right they are

447
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,440
Follow us since we came to Korea

448
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:05,320
so what

449
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:06,240
catch it now

450
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,320
Wait a moment

451
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:43,440
what's the situation

452
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:23,480
Seems to be a local dignitary

453
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,820
First everyone calm down

454
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:35,990
don't make trouble

455
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:37,700
I didn't know you were employees here

456
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:40,000
Let's talk first

457
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,670
look at me hello nice to meet you

458
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:48,000
what to say

459
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,810
Oops, this greeting is a bit harsh.

460
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:00,930
does it have to be like this

461
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,750
Enough is enough

462
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:22,850
I told your boss to let him come see me

463
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,390
There is a bus card, there is a bus stop in front of it

464
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,100
Let's go back

465
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,870
If you want to say something, just say it

466
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:48,540
But does our captain know their boss?

467
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:51,630
very cooked

468
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:55,170
Is that the boss before the captain?

469
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:57,840
Yes

470
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,470
As of ten years ago

471
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,220
it was a long time ago

472
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:05,600
fortunately

473
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,350
yes luckily

474
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:12,310
But why do you say that all of a sudden

475
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:13,320
Um

476
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:14,570
That's right

477
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:15,360
why

478
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,360
don't you like men

479
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,150
Yes

480
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,580
So I

481
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:25,240
what you bastard

482
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,490
bastard

483
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,040
you scold me again

484
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,500
Too much swearing in Korean

485
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:32,960
Gan, don't always sneak around and don't use honorifics with me

486
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:33,750
me

487
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:34,670
yes it's you

488
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:36,130
no absolutely no

489
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:39,010
It should be the reason why you are in a bad mood, Captain.

490
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:47,140
so where are we going now

491
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,230
Wait for this signal

492
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:52,520
open until signal

493
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:56,480
wow really original

494
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:58,820
Do you know how big this island is?

495
00:58:58,940 --> 00:58:59,530
Do not you know

496
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:00,530
heard clearly

497
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:03,740
The area alone is 1833.2 square kilometers

498
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,700
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack, you know?

499
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:09,660
Are you listening to me now?

500
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:53,460
child

501
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:56,290
come to mom

502
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,510
hurry up

503
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,260
come to mom

504
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,490
The smell of cow dung

505
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:57,540
Gotta get this down asap

506
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:05,250
Oh, is that Kyunghee?

507
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,720
long time no see

508
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:10,340
I'm Uncle Long Dou

509
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,890
remember me

510
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:17,890
stand there and don't move

511
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,480
hello that

512
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:26,610
Is it the gun your dad used to hunt with?

513
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,490
you should keep it at the police station

514
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,950
Can't just leave it at home

515
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,320
that's illegal

516
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,580
By the way, you are from America.

517
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:38,250
America

518
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:42,920
Anyway, that's where guns are rife, isn't it?

519
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:47,460
But where did everyone else go?

520
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,550
Why are you the only one holding that thing up your throat?

521
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:51,970
What are you talking about?

522
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:54,050
what to wear

523
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,970
My four men are now semi-crippled

524
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:58,720
life is in danger

525
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:04,860
My subordinates are clamoring to call the police

526
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,980
It's uncle, I managed to stop it

527
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,280
Hey, are Kyunghee and us outsiders?

528
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:14,320
Family matters have to be settled between the family

529
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,830
Can't involve outsiders

530
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,370
That can't be done, you know?

531
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:22,080
say

532
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:26,540
your amazing dad

533
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,210
Didn't I teach you this?

534
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:31,260
I'm asking you

535
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:39,220
Alright alright

536
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,580
Okay now that we've said that

537
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:03,460
So let's talk a little bit of a heartfelt thing today.

538
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:04,580
say what

539
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:05,830
I have nothing to say to you

540
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:08,630
hey, you have that style

541
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,340
To shut up

542
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:14,510
But have you ever shot someone?

543
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:23,180
let's go

544
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:26,230
do not come

545
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:28,520
I tell you not to come

546
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,440
Did you hear me

547
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,110
gan scare me

548
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,610
Tian - bring it here

549
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:37,240
let go of me asshole

550
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,820
- be honest - let me go

551
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:40,160
let go of me asshole

552
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:41,620
I ask you to let me go

553
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:42,290
scares me

554
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:44,210
Gan you gang of dogs Keizi

555
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:45,960
Gangou Keiko

556
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,460
who is this kid

557
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,710
Who are you, stinky boy - Daji

558
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:51,130
get off the bastard

559
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:54,380
don't hit my brother

560
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:56,050
Dog Keiko

561
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:57,300
hello

562
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,140
what kind of baseball player are you

563
01:04:58,140 --> 01:04:59,430
don't hit him

564
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:02,600
don't touch my brother

565
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:09,610
no one in there brother

566
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:12,070
what really nobody

567
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:16,240
Ouch

568
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:22,030
It seems that we, Kyunghee, really didn't take my uncle seriously.

569
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,370
You just rely on this gun

570
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:26,040
Did you get all those bastards out?

571
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:29,710
What the hell have you been talking about?

572
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:32,630
okay

573
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,630
After all, I am very loyal to Brother Zhehao.

574
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:39,300
It's like nothing happened between our kids

575
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:41,430
It's all in the past anyway, what can I do?

576
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:44,350
So just obediently sign the contract.

577
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:45,600
or by handprint

578
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:50,150
Not what the hell are you trying to do here

579
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,650
Whether to raise cattle or sheep

580
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:55,230
Besides, did I let you give it to me for nothing?

581
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,360
I will give you a little more than the market price

582
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:00,700
Just take this money and go to Seoul

583
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:04,740
How about going for a walk and talking about love?

584
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,960
Then have a good life with the younger brothers

585
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:11,040
Parents are gone now

586
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,880
You have to take good care of your brother from now on, don't you?

587
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,000
Zhao family

588
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:16,920
I won't give it to you even if I die

589
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:18,670
How many times do you want me to say

590
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,430
Hey

591
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:23,760
I told you so much

592
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,600
Why don't you give a sincere answer?

593
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:28,430
why are you so bold

594
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:30,100
your dad is dead

595
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,440
But what's going on now

596
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,560
are you denying reality

597
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,230
I know

598
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:36,440
my dad is dead

599
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:39,700
didn't you kill it?

600
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,370
You killed my dad dog Keiko

601
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:51,290
I endure you for a while, but I keep my mouth shut

602
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,540
seal her mouth to me

603
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:55,630
Looks like she's going to be beaten

604
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:57,340
Gan tell the truth

605
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:00,010
As long as her fingerprints are intact

606
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:04,010
Don't hit you puppies

607
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:05,640
Gan let me go

608
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,060
Dog Keiko

609
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:10,600
good luck

610
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:13,810
no no no

611
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:14,730
- Good luck - Gan

612
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:15,480

613
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,360

brat

617
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:27,740
This stinky boy is really on fire

618
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,250
Do you have to be beaten to cheer up?

619
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,500
Say it - don't move brat

620
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,380
what are you talking about, sir

621
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:36,670
where are you looking

622
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,760
Gan scared me to death

623
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:45,090
who is she

624
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:47,680

625
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:48,850

01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:51,430
come down be careful

627
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:52,560
feed down

628
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,810
how did she get up

629
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:56,810
Why are kids so daring lately?

630
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:01,030
hey hey - crazy woman

631
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:03,990
Dangerous fall

632
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:05,570
what is she doing

633
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:07,950
Why are you holding her back for a while?

634
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:09,580
hey hey come down

635
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:25,090
what's the situation

636
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:26,970
acrobatics?

637
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,150
what are you doing

638
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:12,510

639
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:13,930
what is that...

640
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:19,060
Gan, are you here to visit?

641
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:21,190
Think of a way now, scumbags

642
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:30,660
don't come

643
01:09:32,490 --> 01:09:33,490
do not come

644
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:34,950
don't come

645
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:37,660

Forget it

653
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:28,720
I'm all right

654
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:30,970
so stop fighting

655
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,230

656
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:40,390
don't come again

657
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:42,060
Do you understand

658
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:47,900
I cheer you up

659
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,280
Take your men to the hospital now

660
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:53,700

661
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,960

01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:01,620

663
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:03,630
Get out, get out

664
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:44,170
Does it hurt or not, are you alright?

665
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:47,090
sister

666
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:50,460
who is she

667
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:54,550
what did i just see

668
01:11:57,470 --> 01:11:59,600
calm down

669
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:04,060
Actually, she doesn't know.

670
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:06,310
look at her

671
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,190
what

672
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,980
Is she really an alien?

673
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:13,740
really not covered

674
01:12:15,950 --> 01:12:19,080
Wasn't that just a scene from a movie?

675
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:20,990
how did you know her

676
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,750
Gan is great

677
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:24,460
It's amazing

678
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,330
how long will she stay in our house

679
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:28,540
can i talk to her

680
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:29,880
Do you want to shoot a video and send it to youtube?

681
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,420
sure to make money

682
01:12:33,170 --> 01:12:33,920
what are you doing

683
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:34,800
not you

684
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:37,090
No. . . are you alright

685
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,180
Are you sure you're all right, brat

686
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:40,510
pain

687
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:43,350
this is how many

688
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:45,980
what are you doing

689
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:47,480
answer me brat

690
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,690
Sister, don't do this

691
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:54,190
Can you introduce her to me again?

692
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,070
You really have to get along with that kind of person.

693
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,700
Gan is awesome

694
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:45,810
oh who is this

695
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:47,560
Isn't this our Sergeant Zhao?

696
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:49,020
haven't seen you for a long time

697
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:52,900
This is pretty decent

698
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:56,730
I thought it was thrown somewhere

699
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:00,650
Seems to have some conscience

700
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:04,370
Is it because of faith?

701
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:06,240
Well, because I also have faith

702
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,700
And you can't just throw it away

703
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:09,950
It will pollute the environment

704
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,500
we should love the earth

705
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,170
Your face is still as good as ever

706
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:18,840
Still so handsome

707
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:23,510
You also know that this kind of thing is innate

708
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:27,010
you are still handsome

709
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:29,970
Still looking so sharp

710
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:32,980
Forget about the past years

711
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,060
what

712
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:36,730
okay

713
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:38,020
then don't mention it

714
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:41,530
Okay, say something else

715
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:47,700
why did you come back suddenly

716
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:51,200
I thought you would never come back

717
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:53,500
You know what to ask

718
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,210
Of course I know it was Mr. Bai who called you back.

719
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:56,840
But why did you come back

720
01:15:58,670 --> 01:15:59,340
how

721
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:01,630
Is it because of that thing

722
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:04,550
Director Bai, that big Ting

723
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:05,720
Since it has been relegated to the second line

724
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:06,590
Then just wait

725
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:07,890
Why are you doing this?

726
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:09,640
Could it be that something is wrong?

727
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:13,600
Is that Da Ting

728
01:16:15,690 --> 01:16:16,860
Are you doubting me?

729
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,740
Gan really speechless

730
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:26,740
How dare this goddamn hag doubt me

731
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,450
Feed that stinky girl

732
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:33,500
The last person to find is Director Bai, right?

733
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,620
After that, it silently evaporated

734
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,040
do you think that's all

735
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:41,380
Goo Ja-yoon ransacked Hoffen Glass and Bangkok laboratory

736
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:42,880
Before coming to Jeju Island

737
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:45,130
In the end, they also ransacked the Shanghai laboratory, you should know that

738
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:46,630
Advanced Experiments there

739
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,550
The dolls are all gone

740
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:50,220
Plus this time the lab headquarters was stolen

741
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:52,930
How dare you doubt that I am for real

742
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,690
Hey, just get out of the way

743
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:01,730
If you have anything to do with that Dating

744
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:02,860
no good for you

745
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:05,610
I don't care about the group of that company

746
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:07,490
how to fight behind the scenes

747
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,030
I'll figure it out, don't get in my way

748
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,160
If I keep looking for people to follow me, if it gets in my way

749
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,750
Then I won't sit back and watch

750
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:20,250
Oh, you are really

751
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:22,630
Saying it savagely

752
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:26,840
let's go let's not meet again

753
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:29,390
Now they really go their separate ways

754
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:30,930
hello zhao xian

755
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,010
hey stinky girl

756
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,350
It's been ten years since we met

757
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:39,770
Are you really going to leave like this?

758
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:46,860
Otherwise, what do you want to do?

759
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,030
Is it possible to talk about what happened ten years ago?

760
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:51,950
don't go slow

761
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:54,240
Be careful on the road and let them turn the car around

762
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:59,670
This shit is really

763
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:04,630
soy Mujer

764
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:40,670
Is it almost there?

765
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,540
Is it near there?

766
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:49,050
Well, it's almost a little bit soon

767
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:55,300
This island is not as small as I thought

768
01:18:56,390 --> 01:18:59,270
ah so boring

769
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,810
hey look at this too

770
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:07,020
Korean shows are funny and interesting

771
01:19:07,650 --> 01:19:09,650
you look at it more

772
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:12,360
How do you know to watch that all day long?

773
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:16,240
What's the matter, the stinky lady is going to die, isn't she?

774
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:21,080
Take good care of your mouth, be careful I tear up your stinky mouth

775
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,430
hey kidding

776
01:19:35,890 --> 01:19:37,560
I won't argue with her anymore

777
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:42,020
come on

778
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:54,740
Come and see who wins

779
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:58,620
Oops what's the matter?

780
01:19:58,950 --> 01:20:01,160
I played a game when I was a kid

781
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:05,540
Was that childhood?

782
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:08,500
what do you say?

783
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:11,210
fight

784
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:21,180
that... that he

785
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:28,230
how did he live

786
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:31,320
The brain was obviously hit by a bullet.

787
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:34,110
How did you survive until now?

788
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:39,740
Logically speaking, this level should be completely dead.

789
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:41,870
Yup?

790
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:47,080
Do you think I made a mistake?

791
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:49,000
No no absolutely no!

792
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,300
How can something go wrong, eldest sister?

793
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:53,840
I did not mean that

794
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,720
I mean

795
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:16,740
A small fresh meat

796
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:21,620
For the sake of your cuteness, I'll spare you

797
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:28,580
That's right

798
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:32,000
It should be completely cut off.

799
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:41,970
wait

800
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,060
Come and eat, let's eat

801
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:48,640
oh so cute

802
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,860
Is it tasty

803
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:55,280
fell to the ground

804
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:57,280
What about Embi?

805
01:21:57,860 --> 01:21:58,860
Come

806
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:01,530
what's the situation

807
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:03,830
no

808
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,710
not what are you doing

809
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:44,450
hello quack

810
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:50,290
stinky old man

811
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,460
are you still seeing a doctor

812
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:55,380
You are cruelty to animals

813
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:56,960
and also

814
01:22:58,010 --> 01:22:59,420
Did I say that if you dare to see the underground trade

815
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:01,380
Say it and drop your hand

816
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,680
did not say did not say

817
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:06,560
Really lately

818
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:08,770
Only treat cats and dogs

819
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:11,560
And it's just medicine

820
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:15,440
I can't have surgery now

821
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:16,570
yes?

822
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:22,030
Then your hands will be useless

823
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:29,700
dragon fight

824
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:32,540
Not Boss Zhao

825
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,420
Why do you suddenly do this to me

826
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,670
I won't speak out

827
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:41,090
really won't tell

828
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:44,340
be quiet

829
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:46,260
To shut up

830
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,560
you should have something to say to me

831
01:23:49,890 --> 01:23:51,850
say what

832
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,270
The little one that Kyung Hee brought

833
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:58,070
The story about that girl

834
01:24:00,190 --> 01:24:03,780
You must have something to say to me alone

835
01:24:05,570 --> 01:24:06,200
Right

836
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:30,760
Probably the one who is wanted.

837
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:32,680
looks like yes

838
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:34,350
Who is the continuous gold lord

839
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:35,310
have you contacted

840
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:37,480
Yes, brother got the message

841
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,990
wow interesting

842
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:47,160
It's so exciting

843
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:03,300
that's what you see

844
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:05,010
This is the tubing

845
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:09,640
they upload videos of eating

846
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:10,800
keep uploading

847
01:25:10,890 --> 01:25:12,810
If someone clicks in to watch

848
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:13,890
and has a considerable number of views

849
01:25:13,890 --> 01:25:15,270
then you can get an ad

850
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,940
If you get an advertisement

851
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:18,900
money will come

852
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,810
If there are many fans

853
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:24,860
I can earn hundreds of thousands of won every month

854
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:29,660
hey are you listening

855
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:30,870
are you listening

856
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:35,910
Anyway, they make money just by eating.

857
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:39,000
You only need to completely subvert once

858
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,130
Then we're sure to make a fortune

859
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:43,550
what is this

860
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:47,470
Which is this?

861
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:48,300
noodles

862
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:49,470
Is it tasty

863
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:53,640
delicious

864
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:55,810
shall we eat this

865
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,690
ok let's eat

866
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,650
Aren't you listening carefully to me?

867
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:04,820
what is this

868
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:05,650
which

869
01:26:05,650 --> 01:26:07,240
ah hot dog

870
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:08,530
Next to the pizza

871
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:09,360
Is it tasty

872
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:16,040
hey are you listening to me

873
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,450

874
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:19,210
I'll buy you a hot dog

875
01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:20,790
I'll give you some pizza later

876
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,040
I asked if you were listening to me

877
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,090
what is this

878
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:27,460
are you a foodie

879
01:26:27,470 --> 01:26:29,090
why so greedy

880
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:32,050
Don't fix it, don't fix it

881
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:33,260
Forget it, don't fix it

882
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:34,100
stop it

883
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:06,420
Let's try abalone porridge

884
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:08,920
discount today

885
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:17,390
This is a bit hot

886
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:20,600
Please enjoy

887
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:00,140
Be careful, eat slowly

888
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:01,020
hello that. . .

889
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:11,030
she's finished

890
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,440
gone

891
01:28:21,870 --> 01:28:22,410
Hey

892
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:29,250
hey hey hey

893
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,170
hey wait

894
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:39,970
hello uncle

895
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,570
sorry i will do it asap

896
01:28:53,610 --> 01:28:55,740
What a shame, don't eat it

897
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:57,610
Do you have aliens in your belly?

898
01:28:58,870 --> 01:29:00,990
They say I can eat whatever I want

899
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:02,410
You can eat it, but you have to eat it in moderation.

900
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:04,370
Is your planet run like this?

901
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:06,960
oh, where's my sister

902
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:12,170
GAMOR Tian

903
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:23,970
Feeding my sister at Dr. Kar's Uncle's Animal Hospital

904
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:26,480
Uncle got hurt

905
01:29:26,770 --> 01:29:28,520
sorry i was in a hurry

906
01:29:29,810 --> 01:29:31,650
Let's have dinner first

907
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:32,900
I'll be there asap

908
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:49,330
do you want water

909
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:09,890
Although it's useless now

910
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:15,230
But it's enough to stick

911
01:30:18,650 --> 01:30:19,740
Kyunghee

912
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,490
I said that kid

913
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:29,750
Just let it go, not with that kid

914
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:33,290
While Long Dou hasn't caused any trouble

915
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:34,590
let the kid out

916
01:30:35,090 --> 01:30:38,130
You have to hand over that land and house, okay?

917
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:43,350
go back

918
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:45,600
Daji should be waiting for you

919
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:19,380
what

920
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:20,300
Hi

921
01:31:23,390 --> 01:31:24,680
who are you

922
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:27,140
don't be so scared

923
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:29,270
chat with us

924
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:32,190
I'm going really

925
01:31:32,190 --> 01:31:34,190
Where did I say so much?

926
01:31:34,650 --> 01:31:37,520
He can really fly and throw the car out with his bare hands

927
01:31:38,150 --> 01:31:39,360
I'm going really

928
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,360
is a girl

929
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,360
what

930
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:44,910
I don't know, you guy

931
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:47,450
about seventeen eighteen

932
01:31:48,330 --> 01:31:50,790
I'm going to do you know her age

933
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:52,620
Are you going to have a blind date with her?

934
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:55,790
didn't I say

935
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:58,960
Just that one girl

936
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:03,930
okay

937
01:32:03,930 --> 01:32:07,470
I went and bought a few guns

938
01:32:13,890 --> 01:32:14,520
Hey

939
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:18,400
Visit MovieHAB.com to support us

940
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:22,990
Hey

941
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:25,150
what's up with this call

942
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:28,870
Hey

943
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,960
I went to that is a new phone

944
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:40,550
close the door

945
01:33:07,490 --> 01:33:11,080
But who are you

946
01:33:11,290 --> 01:33:13,080
Who is it?

947
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:14,700
It's you who contacted us

948
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:21,710
Ah, that girl in the group is the one

949
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:24,840
Although it's a bit messy here, you should sit first

950
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:57,210
let's chat

951
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:01,420
where is that girl now

952
01:34:05,630 --> 01:34:09,840
If I said you would kill me, wouldn't you?

953
01:34:09,930 --> 01:34:10,760
Do not

954
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:12,010
isn't it?

955
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:16,350
If you don't say it, it will kill you

956
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:25,020
But hurry up, I won't torture you, just kill you

957
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:27,780
I was going to be like him

958
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:35,870
Allows you to observe the organs in your body slowly and in detail

959
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:37,250
kill you again

960
01:34:37,870 --> 01:34:40,250
Haven't you seen your own heart?

961
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,500
right

962
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:45,290
hmm, haven't seen it

963
01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:49,420
I'm not a heart surgeon

964
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:52,470
no need to look at those

965
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:56,600
I couldn't see those

966
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:02,350
But that

967
01:35:02,650 --> 01:35:06,610
I should be able to make some use of it

968
01:35:06,730 --> 01:35:08,610
there should be

969
01:35:10,110 --> 01:35:12,410
It would be a shame to kill

970
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:14,410
I don't eat rice

971
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:18,540
after chatting

972
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:23,080
should be able to figure out our stakes

973
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:24,380
isn't it?

974
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:27,840
tell me

975
01:35:29,130 --> 01:35:32,930
I'll give you a gift

976
01:35:37,930 --> 01:35:38,970
here here here

977
01:35:38,970 --> 01:35:39,930
this this this this

978
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:41,680
Did you see it? Did you see it?

979
01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:44,850
She is the country girl Goo Ja-yoon

980
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:47,230
In fact, it's not the song that made it popular with this image

981
01:35:47,770 --> 01:35:49,940
In my opinion, you are not playing on YouTube

982
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:52,650
Why don't we have this show too?

983
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:57,780
As long as you go, you should be able to explode like that Gu Ziyun

984
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:00,910
Hey, you can't eat rice

985
01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:02,910
You eat a lot, don't you?

986
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:05,210
But I never sang

987
01:36:05,330 --> 01:36:07,750
hey you really

988
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:11,630
Just go to the karaoke hall and practice hard for a few days.

989
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,130
than this

990
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:17,470
Except for picking people's joints and throwing the car out

991
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:18,800
what else would you do

992
01:36:18,930 --> 01:36:21,930
as gentle as her

993
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:24,690
do something

994
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:27,190
I'll get you some pizza

995
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:29,820
It's a different size from the previous one

996
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:31,190
large?

997
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:33,860
Can I order fried chicken as a side dish?

998
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:35,400
I'll give you some pasta

999
01:36:35,410 --> 01:36:36,990
pasta

1000
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,840
are you special?

1001
01:36:58,260 --> 01:37:01,430
not so funny

1002
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:03,390
laugh so much

1003
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:08,900
what is this

1004
01:37:12,570 --> 01:37:14,280
no no feed

1005
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,280
stop laughing

1006
01:37:16,450 --> 01:37:17,860
what to do

1007
01:37:19,570 --> 01:37:21,580
Not that kind

1008
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:25,450
Does that want to be like this?

1009
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:50,690
are you kidding me

1010
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:51,770
right

1011
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:53,770
hey don't do that

1012
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:55,780
let me have a good look

1013
01:37:55,780 --> 01:37:57,450
try you try again

1014
01:37:57,450 --> 01:37:59,610
Do it well, let me see, let me see

1015
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:01,120

1016
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:10,040

01:38:17,170 --> 01:38:18,840

1019
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:21,970
how did you do it

1020
01:38:22,970 --> 01:38:24,180
hey wait a minute

1021
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:25,680
Can't unplug that antenna

1022
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:27,220
Can't pull out the antenna

1023
01:38:27,310 --> 01:38:28,390
want to watch tv

1024
01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:30,390
put it down, put it down

1025
01:38:34,270 --> 01:38:35,270
I go

1026
01:38:35,530 --> 01:38:36,530

1027
01:38:36,530 --> 01:38:38,320
very impressive

1028
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,370
Did you destroy that star just now?

1029
01:38:43,950 --> 01:38:46,200
crazy is it possible?

1030
01:38:46,330 --> 01:38:49,460
Ah that's not

1031
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,420
But where did you learn that

1032
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:56,800
you are very talented

1033
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:19,650
what what what

1034
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:31,210
It's really that kid

1035
01:39:31,210 --> 01:39:33,210
what are you looking at

1036
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:52,230
She's a monster who doesn't know when to mutate

1037
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:55,730
If you don't want your brother to die

1038
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:58,820
Just listen to what I say

1039
01:40:11,790 --> 01:40:12,910
Time for everyone to watch

1040
01:40:13,330 --> 01:40:15,370
Fireworks are about 30 minutes

1041
01:40:16,630 --> 01:40:18,090
If it is not handled well during this period

1042
01:40:18,210 --> 01:40:20,090
The movement will attract the attention of the police or ordinary people

1043
01:40:20,090 --> 01:40:21,590
things will get bigger

1044
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:22,760
Walk

1045
01:40:24,130 --> 01:40:24,880
But the captain

1046
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,140
If only take her brother out

1047
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:28,510
will that girl feel weird

1048
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:30,970
What if she catches her running away?

1049
01:40:31,310 --> 01:40:33,560
I can only pray that she doesn't find out even for a few minutes

1050
01:40:36,810 --> 01:40:38,110
why don't you go

1051
01:40:38,690 --> 01:40:39,860
i want to cover the captain

1052
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:41,440
bullshit

1053
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:42,690
Who is covering whom?

1054
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:43,990
there's no need for you to go

1055
01:40:44,990 --> 01:40:45,530
team leader

1056
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:47,360
team leader

1057
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:49,160
Captain, wait for me to go with you

1058
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:07,180
Put sticky rice balls on top of rice and gulp

1059
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:13,390
What is that

1060
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:15,680
really

1061
01:41:16,230 --> 01:41:17,600
so funny

1062
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:38,500
Did she find the captain?

1063
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:43,460
Didn't I say don't talk into my ear?

1064
01:41:44,010 --> 01:41:45,550
curse again

1065
01:41:46,550 --> 01:41:47,630
curse

1066
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,840
I'm going really

1067
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:52,850
I really want to kill you

1068
01:41:54,020 --> 01:41:55,560
yes fireworks fireworks

1069
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:56,980
fireworks festival today

1070
01:41:57,140 --> 01:41:58,100
what time is it now

1071
01:41:58,230 --> 01:41:59,650
it's time

1072
01:41:59,650 --> 01:42:01,980
Let's go, let's go take up the land

1073
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:06,570
fireworks?

1074
01:42:06,570 --> 01:42:08,110
so pretty

1075
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:09,860
Don't you know that your planet doesn't have one?

1076
01:42:10,110 --> 01:42:13,410
Go check it out first, it's really nice

1077
01:42:13,490 --> 01:42:14,330
Sister, are you not going?

1078
01:42:14,330 --> 01:42:15,790
good luck

1079
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:18,080
What's wrong

1080
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:23,000
let go of her hand

1081
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:24,800
coming out soon ready

1082
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:27,760
When you see them coming out, find a good distance and shoot

1083
01:42:28,590 --> 01:42:29,930
is the captain

1084
01:42:34,430 --> 01:42:36,640
what's wrong with you sister

1085
01:42:37,310 --> 01:42:38,640
run away

1086
01:42:38,850 --> 01:42:40,640
What did you say so suddenly

1087
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:42,650
sorry

1088
01:42:44,690 --> 01:42:46,360
run away

1089
01:42:50,610 --> 01:42:52,160
I go

1090
01:42:56,950 --> 01:42:58,830
what are those guys doing

1091
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:26,770
Captain look behind

1092
01:43:27,150 --> 01:43:29,150
They're from the Shanghai research lab, right?

1093
01:43:38,330 --> 01:43:39,540
who are you

1094
01:43:39,620 --> 01:43:41,870
Didn't I tell you not to come here again? Why are you here again?

1095
01:43:41,870 --> 01:43:43,540
Oh, yes

1096
01:43:44,290 --> 01:43:46,840
We Kyunghee took out that long pole again.

1097
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,550
But we also have

1098
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:49,960
Can you see what's inside

1099
01:43:50,130 --> 01:43:51,380
she's going to the roof

1100
01:43:51,670 --> 01:43:53,010
But the boy was with her too

1101
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:55,010
I go

1102
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:56,510
keep distance

1103
01:43:58,220 --> 01:43:59,180

1104
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:01,680
hey can you see there

1105
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:03,440
There is the main road

1106
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:05,440
Can you run there in one go?

1107
01:44:05,650 --> 01:44:06,810
go go go

1108
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:09,070

Come back when things get better

1112
01:44:17,410 --> 01:44:18,410
We're going to the karaoke hall

1113
01:44:18,410 --> 01:44:19,660
I'll give you pizza every day

1114
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:21,660

1115
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:28,670

1125
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:22,560
nothing without captain

1126
01:45:22,810 --> 01:45:24,350
Will it be blown up by two missiles?

1127
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:26,640
isn't there either?

1128
01:45:26,850 --> 01:45:27,890

1129
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:28,690

I'm going I'm so fed up with your family

1134
01:47:12,710 --> 01:47:17,670
If there are so many, there will be that kind of child who insists on getting along with me

1135
01:47:18,380 --> 01:47:21,300
I'll go to the dragon fight you goddamn bastard

1136
01:47:21,590 --> 01:47:25,640

1140
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:38,860
He was going to kill me but he died

1141
01:47:38,860 --> 01:47:39,900

1142

I go I have been loyal for 15 years

1143
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:50,120
Did you know that I won these lands with my body?

1144
01:47:50,370 --> 01:47:51,500
You do not know

1145
01:47:54,710 --> 01:47:57,590
What am I talking about to a little boy?

1146
01:47:58,050 --> 01:48:01,170
Okay, let's go with your sister too

01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:09,680
It's not your turn on this occasion

as you like

1152
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:17,020
How can you decide for yourself

1153
01:48:17,650 --> 01:48:20,020
Why are you ruining my interest?

1154
01:48:55,190 --> 01:48:57,100
I went to the captain, did you see it?

1155
01:48:57,190 --> 01:48:58,560
She's not in the rank with those before her

1156
01:48:58,560 --> 01:48:59,400
hurry up and shoot you guy

1157
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:01,400

1163
01:50:54,050 --> 01:50:57,350
don't make me upset

1164
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:04,020
Captain again

1165
01:51:06,530 --> 01:51:08,400
this is new

1166
01:51:08,940 --> 01:51:10,190
I'm going really

1167
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,530
That's how you keep telling me to cover me

1168
01:51:12,870 --> 01:51:14,120
go

1169
01:51:14,870 --> 01:51:16,910
This is new

1170
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:25,000
Hey

1171
01:53:34,630 --> 01:53:37,880
wow it's you

1172
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:42,010
it's wired

1173
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:46,600
I must have smashed your head into pieces

1174
01:53:47,850 --> 01:53:49,650
how did you survive

1175
01:53:56,240 --> 01:54:01,280
I'll take your neck off this time

1176
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:30,140
team leader

1177
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:31,310
how are the kids

1178
01:54:37,150 --> 01:54:37,900
what are you gonna do

1179
01:54:38,990 --> 01:54:39,860
he is normal

1180
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:56,310
good luck

1181
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:57,770
Scared me

1182
01:55:57,940 --> 01:55:59,480
I saw

1183
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:02,190
Aren't you scared to pee?

1184
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:12,500
I go to those monsters

1185
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:18,540
quite unexpected

1186
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,800
Is it different from before?

1187
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:24,050
That's also a bad breed

1188
01:56:58,790 --> 01:57:00,500
one more

1189
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:27,030
you guy

1190
01:57:30,030 --> 01:57:31,120
it really hurts

1191
01:57:31,790 --> 01:57:34,910
but what use are these to us

1192
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:23,170
what's the situation

1193
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:28,840
She ignores us

1194
01:58:54,370 --> 01:58:55,870
really alive

1195
01:58:56,700 --> 01:58:57,910
but

1196
01:58:57,910 --> 01:58:59,750
Whether it was then or now

1197
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:03,630
She doesn't look that great anyway

1198
01:59:05,130 --> 01:59:06,750
is she

1199
01:59:07,630 --> 01:59:08,960
where is amazing

1200
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:36,530
you monster

1201
02:03:41,950 --> 02:03:42,490
you

1202
02:03:43,030 --> 02:03:44,280
finally come

1203
02:03:58,750 --> 02:04:00,210
haven't seen you for a long time

1204
02:04:01,630 --> 02:04:03,170
don't bother

1205
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:19,860
But did you already know each other?

1206
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:23,440
I understand

1207
02:04:24,450 --> 02:04:25,450
how did you meet

1208
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:31,950
She was born living alone at the lab headquarters

1209
02:04:33,830 --> 02:04:35,000
she is my sister

1210
02:04:36,210 --> 02:04:38,380
I asked you to release my sister

1211
02:04:38,710 --> 02:04:40,210
who told you to kill her

1212
02:04:40,340 --> 02:04:41,210
Zi Yun

1213
02:05:00,110 --> 02:05:02,690
ah they?

1214
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:06,700
I asked them to find you

1215
02:05:06,820 --> 02:05:08,410
from Shanghai, China

1216
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:15,870
I was hurt a little

1217
02:05:15,870 --> 02:05:18,830
I can't handle it if you mess up

1218
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,670
So I'll ask them

1219
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:28,340
But I wasn't sure at first that it was you

1220
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:31,260
you have been bullied by them

1221
02:05:34,930 --> 02:05:37,350
My sister can't be like that

1222
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:41,900
So I don't think you're going to go

1223
02:05:45,570 --> 02:05:47,030
but here

1224
02:05:48,610 --> 02:05:50,240
feel you

1225
02:05:52,950 --> 02:05:56,540
Feeling a little rusty all of a sudden

1226
02:05:57,670 --> 02:06:01,040
It's also when we're only together when we're in mother's womb

1227
02:06:01,170 --> 02:06:03,500
separated at birth

1228
02:06:05,380 --> 02:06:08,380
Did you just let me out?

1229
02:06:09,680 --> 02:06:10,800
Um

1230
02:06:11,140 --> 02:06:12,100
why

1231
02:06:12,680 --> 02:06:14,100
because i need you

1232
02:06:16,930 --> 02:06:19,020
you need me too

1233
02:06:19,980 --> 02:06:21,730
so why

1234
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:26,820
want to see mom

1235
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:31,320
who i heard said

1236
02:06:32,490 --> 02:06:35,160
Your consciousness and mother are connected

1237
02:06:35,950 --> 02:06:37,750
Mom has been looking for you

1238
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:40,620
she doesn't find me

1239
02:06:52,050 --> 02:06:53,850
go with sister

1240
02:07:06,070 --> 02:07:09,940
You are too indifferent to your sister you haven't seen for a long time, right?

1241
02:07:27,630 --> 02:07:31,670
do you hurt

1242
02:07:32,470 --> 02:07:35,050
do you know what that feels like

1243
02:07:35,390 --> 02:07:37,050
i want to save them

1244
02:07:39,430 --> 02:07:41,100
can also do

1245
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:44,810
But you can't save both

1246
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:47,650
you choose

1247
02:07:48,440 --> 02:07:52,860
It's just that no one can be an ordinary human being

1248
02:07:53,660 --> 02:07:55,160
Is it okay

1249
02:08:21,600 --> 02:08:25,390
Wouldn't it be better to die as a human?

1250
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:07,730
Let's go to mom's place with my sister

1251
02:10:16,720 --> 02:10:20,300
Those kids meet after all

1252
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:25,640
Coming soon to find their mother

1253
02:10:31,060 --> 02:10:35,900
how to draw like

1254
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:45,950
Then let's get ready

1255
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:15,020
Don't go away! Easter eggs at the end

1256
02:14:28,260 --> 02:14:31,260
almost suffocated

1257
02:14:33,970 --> 02:14:35,180
they are gone

1258
02:14:35,350 --> 02:14:36,640
gone away

1259
02:14:38,890 --> 02:14:39,520
team leader

1260
02:14:41,190 --> 02:14:42,650
Captain, they're gone

1261
02:14:45,070 --> 02:14:46,530
Captain, they're gone

1262
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:50,240
team leader

1263
02:14:52,530 --> 02:14:54,240
captain captain

1264
02:14:57,290 --> 02:14:59,330
captain captain

1265
02:15:00,040 --> 02:15:01,000
Captain wake up

1266
02:15:01,170 --> 02:15:02,670
can captain hear me

1267
02:15:03,250 --> 02:15:04,080
team leader

1268
02:15:04,710 --> 02:15:07,170
What if you die like this?

1269
02:15:07,420 --> 02:15:08,090
I go

1270
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:19,060
Hear your voice, those monsters have to come to us

1271
02:15:26,610 --> 02:15:27,820
The children were also taken away

1272
02:15:30,030 --> 02:15:31,490
what to do

1273
02:15:31,700 --> 02:15:33,160
lift me up

1274
02:15:39,750 --> 02:15:40,660
let's go

1275
02:15:40,750 --> 02:15:42,120
hurry up chasing them

1276
02:15:43,710 --> 02:15:44,960
give me your phone

1277
02:16:13,070 --> 02:16:14,990
You have memorized my cell phone number

1278
02:16:15,990 --> 02:16:18,030
what's wrong

1279
02:16:18,370 --> 02:16:20,040
Don't you mean we'll never see you again?

1280
02:16:20,330 --> 02:16:22,540
when did you start there

1281
02:16:23,120 --> 02:16:25,330
You don't care when I'm here, get to the point

1282
02:16:26,170 --> 02:16:27,330
Yes

1283
02:16:27,880 --> 02:16:30,000
I never wanted to see you again

1284
02:16:30,420 --> 02:16:34,550
But the situation does not allow please support us

1285
02:16:34,930 --> 02:16:37,970
Why should I help you don't you doubt me?

1286
02:16:38,100 --> 02:16:40,640
really stingy

1287
02:16:41,270 --> 02:16:43,810
Are you still calculating these things?

1288
02:16:44,020 --> 02:16:45,810
That should also be understood.

1289
02:16:46,060 --> 02:16:47,480
So what do you want me to do?

1290
02:16:47,730 --> 02:16:49,480
I'm going really

1291
02:16:49,900 --> 02:16:52,190
Are you going to keep chatting like this?

1292
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:54,990
Don't hurry up and catch those people.

1293
02:16:56,280 --> 02:16:58,870
My phone is new

1294
02:17:04,620 --> 02:17:06,120
don’t worry

1295
02:17:06,920 --> 02:17:10,090
I know where they're going
