00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:16,340
Chem Club president Taylor McHessey can answer all of your questions about that,

164
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:18,507
(rings)

165
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:22,280
Ah, the cell phone menace has returned to our crucible of learning,

166
00:10:22,353 --> 00:10:24,753
- Is it your phone? - Sharpay and Ryan, cell phones,

167
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:27,723
- I will see you in detention, - Ahh!

168
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:30,784
We have zero tolerance for cell phones in class,

169
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:33,922
so we will get to know each other in detention, Cell phone,

170
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:40,233
And welcome to East High, Miss Montez, Mr, Bolton, I see your phone is involved,

171
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:44,968
- So we will see you in detention as well, - That's not a possibility, Miss Darbus,

172
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:48,569
Your Honor, see, 'cause we have basketball practice, and Troy...

173
00:10:48,646 --> 00:10:52,082
Ah, that will be 15 minutes for you too, Mr, Danforth, Count 'em,

174
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,675
Could be tough for Chad, He can't count that high,

175
00:10:54,752 --> 00:10:57,152
- Taylor McHessey, 15 minutes, - (Taylor gasps)

176
00:10:57,221 --> 00:11:00,748
Shall the carnage continue? Holidays are over, people,

177
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:05,762
Way over! Now, any more comments, questions?

178
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:10,795
- Jason, - How were your holidays, Miss Darbus?

179
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:12,096
What?

180
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,161
(bell rings)

181
00:11:20,044 --> 00:11:23,673
- Sorry, man, See you in detention, - See you later, It's all good,

182
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:25,579
Uhh, she's crazy,

183
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:28,248
Hey!

184
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:29,752
- I don't... - Believe it,

185
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:32,051
- Well, me... - Either, But how?

186
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:35,456
My mom's company transferred her here to Albuquerque,

187
00:11:35,526 --> 00:11:38,791
I can't believe you live here, I looked for you at the lodge on New Year's Day,

188
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:41,593
- We had to leave first thing, - Why are you whispering?

189
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:45,693
What? Oh, uh... my friends know about the snowboarding,

190
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,967
I haven't quite told them about the singing thing,

191
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,302
- What's up? - Hey,

192
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:53,275
- Too much for them to handle? - No, it was cool,

193
00:11:53,344 --> 00:11:57,280
But, you know, my friends, it's, uh... It's not what I do,

194
00:11:57,348 --> 00:12:01,375
That was, like, a different person,

195
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:07,783
So, uh... anyway, welcome to East High,

196
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:11,488
Now that you've met Miss Darbus, I bet you just can't wait to sign up for that,

197
00:12:11,562 --> 00:12:15,692
I won't be signing up for anything for a while, I just wanna get to know the school,

198
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:18,462
But if you sign up, I'd consider coming to the show,

199
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:22,597
- Yeah, yeah, That's completely impossible, - What's impossible, Troy?

200
00:12:22,673 --> 00:12:25,870
I wouldn't think "impossible" is even in your vocabulary,

201
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:29,674
Oh, so nice of you to show our new classmate around,

202
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:41,322
Oh, were you going to sign up too? My brother and I

203
00:12:41,392 --> 00:12:45,123
have starred in all the school's productions and we really welcome newcomers,

204
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:49,257
There are a lot of supporting roles, I'm sure we could find something for you,

205
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,461
No, no, no, I was just looking at all the bulletin boards,

206
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:54,869
Lots going on at this school, Wow,

207
00:12:57,275 --> 00:13:00,210
Nice penmanship,

208
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:06,039
So, Troy, I missed you during vacation, What'd you do?

209
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:10,918
You know, um... played basketball, snowboarding, more basketball,

210
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:13,252
- When's the big game? - Two weeks,

211
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:18,324
You are so dedicated, Just like me,

212
00:13:18,396 --> 00:13:21,160
I hope you come watch me in the musical, Promise?

213
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:26,765
- Toodles! - Toodles,

214
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:39,608
Dude, you know that school musical thing? You get extra credit just for auditioning?

215
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:42,278
- Who cares? - It's always good to get extra credit...

216
00:13:42,353 --> 00:13:43,911
... for college...

217
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:47,446
Think LeBron James or Shaquille O'Neal auditioned for their school musical?

218
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:49,425
- Maybe, - Troy,

219
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:55,523
The music in those shows isn't hip-hop, or rock, or anything essential to culture,

220
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,095
It's, like, show music, It's all costumes and makeup...

221
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:05,336
- Oh, dude, it's frightening, - I know, I thought it'd be a good laugh,

222
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:08,845
- Sharpay's kinda cute, too, - So is a mountain lion,

223
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:11,040
But you don't pet it,

224
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,247
All right, Wildcats! Pair up!

225
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:20,017
Let's go! Come on!

226
00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:24,092
(balls bouncing rhythmically)

227
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:36,301
& Coach said to fake right and break left

228
00:14:36,374 --> 00:14:38,239
& Watch out for the pick and keep an eye on defense

229
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:40,300
& Gotta run the give and go and take the ball to the hole

230
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:42,903
& And don't be afraid to shoot the outside "J"

231
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,939
& Just keep your head in the game Just keep your head in the game

232
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:49,987
& And don't be afraid to shoot the outside "J"

233
00:14:50,054 --> 00:14:53,353
& Just keep your head in the game You gotta get your head in the game

234
00:14:53,424 --> 00:14:55,289
& We gotta get our, get our, get our, get our head in the game

235
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,452
& You gotta get your, get your head in the game

236
00:14:57,528 --> 00:14:59,519
& We gotta get our, get our, get our, get our head in the game

237
00:14:59,597 --> 00:15:01,656
& Come on, get your, get your head in the game

238
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:03,825
& We gotta get our, get our, get our, get our head in the game

239
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:05,926
& You gotta get your, get your head in the game

240
00:15:06,003 --> 00:15:08,164
& We gotta get our, get our, get our, get our head in the game

241
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:10,332
- & Whoo! - (whistle blows)

242
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:12,706
& Let's make sure that we get the rebound

243
00:15:12,777 --> 00:15:14,904
& 'Cause when we get it then the crowd'll go wild

244
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:16,708
& A second chance, gotta grab it and go

245
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:21,411
& Maybe this time we'll hit the right notes

246
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:25,387
& Wait a minute, not the time and place wait a minute, get my head in the game

247
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:27,321
& Wait a minute get my head in the game

248
00:15:27,391 --> 00:15:31,384
& Wait a minute, wait a minute I gotta get my, get my head in the game

249
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:33,623
& You gotta get your, get your, get your, get your head in the game

250
00:15:33,698 --> 00:15:35,723
& I gotta get my, get my head in the game

251
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,734
& You gotta get your, get your, get your, get your head in the game

252
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:39,861
& Come on, get my, get my head in the game

253
00:15:39,937 --> 00:15:42,132
& You gotta get your, get your, get your, get your head in the game

254
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:44,174
& I gotta get my, get my head in the game

255
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:47,039
& You gotta get your, get your, get your, get your head in the game, whoo

256
00:15:47,111 --> 00:15:51,047
& Why am I feeling so wrong?

257
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:54,380
& My head's in the game but my heart's in the song

258
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:57,353
& She makes this feel so right

259
00:15:57,421 --> 00:15:59,321
Should I go for it?

260
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,951
I better shake this, Yikes!

261
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:24,511
& I gotta get my, get my head in the game

262
00:16:24,582 --> 00:16:26,516
& You gotta get your, get your, get your, get your head in the game

263
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:28,518
& I gotta get my, get my head in the game

264
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:30,747
& You gotta get your, get your, get your, get your head in the game

265
00:16:30,821 --> 00:16:33,016
& Come on, get my, get my head in the game

266
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,285
& You gotta get your, get your, get your, get your head in the game

267
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:37,190
& I gotta get my, get my head in the game

268
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:39,286
& You gotta get your, get your, get your, get your head in the game

269
00:16:39,363 --> 00:16:41,593
& Whoo!

270
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:44,566
(players whooping and yelling)

271
00:16:44,635 --> 00:16:46,159
- (boy) What team? - (all) Wildcats!

272
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:47,363
- What team? - Wildcats!

273
00:16:47,438 --> 00:16:48,803
- What team? - Wildcats!

274
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:51,273
- Wildcats! - Get your head in the game!

275
00:16:51,342 --> 00:16:53,333
(cheering)

276
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:07,483
So, it seemed like you knew Troy Bolton,

277
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:09,685
Not really, He was just showing me around,

278
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,424
(laughs) Well, Troy usually doesn't interact with new students,

279
00:17:14,498 --> 00:17:18,332
- Uh, why not? - It's pretty much basketball 24/7 with him,

280
00:17:18,402 --> 00:17:21,963
- That should be 16 over pi... - Yes, Miss Montez?

281
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,768
I'm sorry, I was just... Uh...

282
00:17:24,642 --> 00:17:27,577
Shouldn't the second equation read 16 over pi?

283
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:33,049
16 over pi? That's quite impossible,

284
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:37,185
I stand corrected,

285
00:17:40,324 --> 00:17:42,952
Oh... and welcome aboard,

286
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:04,103
- Catch you later, guys, - OK,

287
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,041
Troy Bolton was looking at our audition list,

288
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,609
Again?

289
00:18:11,722 --> 00:18:15,715
He was hanging around with that new girl and they were both looking at the list,

290
00:18:15,793 --> 00:18:19,695
There's something freaky about her, Where did she say she's from?

291
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:22,361
(scoffs)

292
00:18:37,882 --> 00:18:40,373
Wow! An Einsteinette,

293
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:43,147
So why do you think she's interested in our musical?

294
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,987
I'm not sure that she is, And we needn't concern ourselves with amateurs,

295
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:51,027
But... there is no harm in making certain

296
00:18:51,095 --> 00:18:54,531
that Gabriella's welcome to school activities that are...

297
00:18:54,598 --> 00:18:56,964
... well, appropriate for her,

298
00:18:57,268 --> 00:18:59,429
After all...

299
00:18:59,503 --> 00:19:01,528
... she loves pi,

300
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:11,106
Gold! More gold!

301
00:19:15,886 --> 00:19:18,354
Paint, paint! Let's go!

302
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,860
- The answer is yes! - Huh?

303
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:28,160
Our scholastic decathlon team has its first competition next week,

304
00:19:28,232 --> 00:19:30,029
and there is certainly a spot for you,

305
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,967
- Where did those come from? - Didn't you put them in my locker?

306
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:36,973
- Of course not, - Well, we'd love to have you on our team,

307
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,441
We meet almost every day after school,

308
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,000
Please?

309
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:44,912
I need to catch up on the curriculum here before I think about joining any clubs,

310
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:49,316
Well, what a perfect way to get caught up, Meeting with the smartest kids in school,

311
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:53,982
- What a generous offer, Taylor, - So many new faces in detention today,

312
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:55,685
I hope you don't make a habit of it,

313
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,195
but the drama club can always use an extra hand,

314
00:19:59,263 --> 00:20:05,998
And while we are working, let us probe the mounting evils of cell phones,

315
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,435
(whistle blows)

316
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:12,703
Come on, guys, huddle up! We got two weeks to the big game,

317
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:14,971
Where's Troy and Chad?

318
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:20,416
Don't make me ask again,

319
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:23,647
- Where's Troy and Chad?! - (all) Detention,

320
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:26,212
(sighs)

321
00:20:27,992 --> 00:20:29,584
(whistle blows)

322
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:35,257
Perhaps the most heinous example of cell-phone abuse is ringing in the theater,

323
00:20:35,332 --> 00:20:39,325
What temerity! The theater is a temple of art,

324
00:20:39,403 --> 00:20:45,569
- A precious cornucopia of creative energy, - Where's my team, Darbus?

325
00:20:45,642 --> 00:20:47,610
What the heck are those two doing in a tree?

326
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:50,670
It's called crime and punishment, Bolton,

327
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:55,276
Besides, proximity to the arts is cleansing for the soul,

328
00:20:55,352 --> 00:20:57,343
Can we have a talk, please?

329
00:20:57,421 --> 00:20:59,651
And you two, in the gym, now!

330
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:11,467
If they have to paint sets for detention, they could do it tonight, not during practice,

331
00:21:11,535 --> 00:21:15,562
If these were theater performers, would you seek special treatment?

332
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:19,131
Darbus, we are days away from our biggest game of the year,

333
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:23,703
And we, Bolton, are in the midst of our auditions for our winter musicale as well!

334
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:28,047
This school is about more than just young men in baggy shorts

335
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:30,382
flinging balls for touchdowns!

336
00:21:30,454 --> 00:21:32,979
Baskets! They shoot baskets,

337
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:36,618
Stop! Guys, listen, you've been having this argument

338
00:21:36,693 --> 00:21:38,820
since the day you both started teaching here,

339
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:41,194
We are one school, one student body,

340
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:44,234
one faculty! Can we not agree on that?

341
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,334
So, Coach, how's the team lookin'?

342
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:51,602
- Troy got 'em whipped into shape? - Oh!

343
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,437
(whistle blows)

344
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:58,907
West High Knights have knocked us out of the playoffs three years running,

345
00:21:58,982 --> 00:22:03,214
and now we are one game away from taking that championship back from 'em!

346
00:22:03,921 --> 00:22:06,822
It's time to make our stand,

347
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,222
The team is you,

348
00:22:09,293 --> 00:22:13,787
You are the team, And this team does not exist

349
00:22:13,864 --> 00:22:19,803
unless each and every one of you is fully focused on our goal, Am I clear?

350
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,531
- Hey, what team?! - Wildcats!

351
00:22:21,605 --> 00:22:22,970
- What team? - Wildcats!

352
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,371
- What team? - Wildcats!

353
00:22:24,441 --> 00:22:26,432
- Wildcats! - Get your head in the game!

354
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:29,306
We've never made it past the first round

355
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:32,212
of the scholastic decathlon, You could be our answered prayer,

356
00:22:32,282 --> 00:22:34,216
I'm focusing on my studies this semester,

357
00:22:34,284 --> 00:22:37,378
and help my mom get the new house organized, Maybe next year,

358
00:22:37,454 --> 00:22:41,982
- What do you know about Troy Bolton? - Troy? Hmm,

359
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:44,653
I'm not an expert on that particular sub-species,

360
00:22:44,728 --> 00:22:46,753
however, unless you speak cheerleader,

361
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:51,927
as in, "Oh, my gosh! Isn't Troy Bolton just the hottie super-bum?"

362
00:22:52,002 --> 00:22:55,597
Oh, he's so beautiful,

363
00:22:55,672 --> 00:22:59,665
- Ha-ha, See what I mean? - I don't know how to speak cheerleader,

364
00:22:59,743 --> 00:23:03,008
We exist in an alternate universe to Troy the basketball boy,

365
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,479
Have you tried to get to know him?

366
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:07,381
Watch how it works tomorrow when you have lunch with us,

367
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:10,978
Unless you'd rather sit with the cheerleaders and discuss firm nail beds,

368
00:23:11,054 --> 00:23:13,284
My nail beds are history,

369
00:23:13,357 --> 00:23:16,053
Sister!

370
00:23:19,596 --> 00:23:22,360
- Still don't understand this detention thing, - It was my fault,

371
00:23:22,432 --> 00:23:24,195
- Sorry, Dad, - Cross court,

372
00:23:24,268 --> 00:23:29,433
Darbus will take any opportunity to bust my chops, That includes yours too,

373
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:30,996
Hey, Dad?

374
00:23:31,074 --> 00:23:35,773
Did you ever want to try something new, but were afraid of what your friends think?

375
00:23:35,846 --> 00:23:37,677
Like, going left? You're doing fine,

376
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:40,744
Well... no,

377
00:23:40,817 --> 00:23:43,251
I mean, what if you wanna try something really new

378
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,313
and it's a total disaster and all your friends laugh at you,

379
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:51,418
Maybe they're not your friends, That was my whole point about team today,

380
00:23:51,495 --> 00:23:53,861
You gotta look out for each other, You're the leader,

381
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:56,399
There's gonna be college scouts at our game next week,

382
00:23:56,466 --> 00:23:58,832
Know what a scholarship is worth these days?

383
00:23:58,902 --> 00:24:01,632
- A lot, - Yeah, Focus, Troy, come on,

384
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:06,302
Whoo,

385
00:24:16,887 --> 00:24:19,378
Just something for you,

386
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:25,526
(bell ringing)

387
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:30,590
I expect we all learned our homeroom manners yesterday, people, correct?

388
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:34,068
If not, we have some dressing rooms that need painting,

389
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:37,368
Now, a few announcements,

390
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:42,344
This morning during free period will be your chance for the musicale auditions,

391
00:24:42,412 --> 00:24:44,880
both single and pairs,

392
00:24:44,948 --> 00:24:50,011
I will be in the theater until noon for those of you bold enough to extend

393
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:53,079
the wingspan of your creative spirit,

394
00:24:53,156 --> 00:24:55,522
When's she due back on the mother ship?

395
00:24:55,592 --> 00:24:57,890
Discussing the importance of Shakespeare...

396
00:24:59,763 --> 00:25:01,094
- What's up, man? - What's up?

397
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:04,258
The team's hitting the gym during free period, What should we run?

398
00:25:04,334 --> 00:25:07,735
I can't make it, I gotta catch up on some homework,

399
00:25:07,804 --> 00:25:11,672
What? Hello, it's only the second day back, I'm not even behind on homework yet,

400
00:25:11,742 --> 00:25:14,540
And I've been behind on homework since preschool,

401
00:25:14,611 --> 00:25:17,671
That's hilarious, I'll catch you later,

402
00:25:19,483 --> 00:25:21,849
Homework? There's no way,

403
00:25:26,356 --> 00:25:28,324
- How's it going? - (Troy) Just hanging out?

404
00:25:28,392 --> 00:25:31,418
- Good to see you, - What's he doing?

405
00:25:33,063 --> 00:25:35,054
How's it going, man?

406
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,631
Short-cut,

407
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,576
I'm late for class,

408
00:26:38,895 --> 00:26:40,886
(boy) That's good, just leave it here,

409
00:26:46,636 --> 00:26:48,763
(overlapping chatter)

410
00:27:04,054 --> 00:27:08,582
This is where the true expression of the artist is realized,

411
00:27:08,658 --> 00:27:11,650
Where inner truth is revealed through the actor's journey...

412
00:27:11,728 --> 00:27:13,059
(bell ringing)

413
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:15,928
- Was that a cell phone? - Is it mine?

414
00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:18,593
- No, ma'am, That was the warning bell, - Ah!

415
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:22,195
Those wishing to audition must understand that time is of the essence,

416
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:26,504
We have many roles to cast and final callbacks will be next week,

417
00:27:26,576 --> 00:27:30,103
First, you will sing a few bars and I will give you a sense of whether or not

418
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:36,176
the theater is your calling, Better to hear it from me now than from your friends later,

419
00:27:36,253 --> 00:27:38,983
Our composer, Kelsi Nielson, will accompany you

420
00:27:39,055 --> 00:27:42,786
and be available for rehearsals prior to callbacks,

421
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:43,883
Shall we?

422
00:27:44,928 --> 00:27:49,092
(off-key) & It's hard to believe that I couldn't see

423
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:52,533
& That you were always right beside me

424
00:27:52,602 --> 00:27:56,094
& This feeling like no other

425
00:27:56,173 --> 00:27:59,870
& I want you to know

426
00:28:00,544 --> 00:28:05,777
Uh-huh, Yes, thank you, Next!

427
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:08,010
(badly off-key) & It's hard to believe

428
00:28:08,952 --> 00:28:13,321
& That I couldn't sneeze... see

429
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:17,326
& That you were always right there next to beside me

430
00:28:17,394 --> 00:28:20,420
Alan, I admire your pluck,

431
00:28:20,497 --> 00:28:22,931
- As to your singing... - &... like no other

432
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:27,629
That's a wonderful tie you're wearing, Next!

433
00:28:27,704 --> 00:28:32,607
(off-key) & It's hard to believe that I couldn't see

434
00:28:32,676 --> 00:28:36,134
& That you were always there beside me

435
00:28:36,213 --> 00:28:40,149
& This feeling's like no other

436
00:28:40,217 --> 00:28:42,412
& I want you to know

437
00:28:42,486 --> 00:28:45,614
Uh... stop,

438
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:50,649
(high-pitched) &... so lonely before I finally found

439
00:28:50,727 --> 00:28:53,525
& What I've been looking...

440
00:28:53,597 --> 00:28:55,792
&... for

441
00:28:55,866 --> 00:28:58,460
(holding note)

442
00:29:00,504 --> 00:29:02,165
Ah... Cindra,

443
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:08,667
What courage to pursue a note that has not been accessed in the natural world,

444
00:29:08,745 --> 00:29:11,737
Bravo! Brava!

445
00:29:11,815 --> 00:29:16,184
Perhaps the spring musicale,

446
00:29:29,432 --> 00:29:32,731
(crashing)

447
00:29:35,505 --> 00:29:39,999
- & It's hard to believe that I could not see - & Can't see

448
00:29:40,076 --> 00:29:42,840
- & That you were right beside me - & Beside me

449
00:29:42,913 --> 00:29:45,711
- & Thought I was alone - & Alone

450
00:29:45,782 --> 00:29:48,751
- & With no one to hold - & To hold

451
00:29:48,818 --> 00:29:52,345
- & But you were right beside me - & Beside me

452
00:29:54,658 --> 00:29:57,650
(Darbus) Well, that was just...

453
00:29:57,727 --> 00:30:02,664
... very disturbing, Go see a counselor, Uhh,

454
00:30:02,732 --> 00:30:03,790
Next!

455
00:30:05,135 --> 00:30:07,160
Hey!

456
00:30:07,237 --> 00:30:09,569
So you decided to sign up for something?

457
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:13,541
- Uh... No, You? - No,

458
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:18,377
Um... why are you hiding behind a mop?

459
00:30:18,448 --> 00:30:20,882
Your friends don't know you're here, right?

460
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:23,784
Right,

461
00:30:23,853 --> 00:30:27,880
(& plays intro)

462
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:29,755
Thank you, Next,

463
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:35,825
Miss Darbus is a little... harsh,

464
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:41,098
- The Wildcat superstar's afraid? - No! I'm not afraid, I...

465
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:46,074
- I'm just... scared, - Me too... usually,

466
00:30:46,142 --> 00:30:52,103
And for the lead roles of Minnie and Arnold we only have one couple signed up,

467
00:30:52,182 --> 00:30:56,141
Sharpay and Ryan, I think it might be useful for you

468
00:30:56,219 --> 00:31:01,418
to give us a sense of why we gather in this hallowed hall,

469
00:31:08,131 --> 00:31:09,291
What key?

470
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:12,631
Oh, we had our rehearsal pianist do an arrangement,

471
00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:14,431
Oh,

472
00:31:19,075 --> 00:31:22,135
(whinnies like a horse)

473
00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:23,839
Go!

474
00:31:32,288 --> 00:31:35,815
& It's hard to believe that I couldn't see

475
00:31:35,892 --> 00:31:38,918
(both) & You were always there beside me

476
00:31:38,995 --> 00:31:42,624
& Thought I was alone with no one to hold

477
00:31:42,699 --> 00:31:45,497
& But you were always right beside me

478
00:31:45,568 --> 00:31:52,235
- & This feeling's like no other - & I want you to know

479
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:56,608
& I've never had someone that knows me like you do

480
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,944
& The way you do

481
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:03,452
& I've never had someone as good for me as you

482
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,886
& No one like you

483
00:32:05,955 --> 00:32:10,915
& So lonely before I finally found

484
00:32:10,994 --> 00:32:14,555
& What I've been looking for

485
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:24,433
& So good to be seen, so good to be heard

486
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:26,873
& Don't have to say a word

487
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:31,175
& For so long I was lost, so good to be found

488
00:32:31,247 --> 00:32:35,206
& I'm lovin' having you around

489
00:32:35,285 --> 00:32:38,880
& This feeling's like no other

490
00:32:38,955 --> 00:32:42,015
& I want you to know

491
00:32:42,092 --> 00:32:46,426
& I've never had someone that knows me like you do

492
00:32:46,496 --> 00:32:48,691
& The way you do

493
00:32:48,765 --> 00:32:53,395
& I've never had someone as good for me as you

494
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,233
& No one like you

495
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:00,339
& So lonely before I finally found

496
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:03,436
& What I've been looking for

497
00:33:03,513 --> 00:33:04,605
& Do-do-do

498
00:33:04,681 --> 00:33:07,616
& Do do-do-do do-do

499
00:33:07,684 --> 00:33:09,743
& Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

500
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:11,116
& Do-do-do-do

501
00:33:11,187 --> 00:33:14,020
& Do do-do-do do-do

502
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:17,116
& Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

503
00:33:23,032 --> 00:33:24,897
I told you not to do the jazz squares,

504
00:33:24,968 --> 00:33:28,062
It's a crowd favorite, Everybody loves a good jazz square,

505
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:32,467
(applause)

506
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:33,600
Well...

507
00:33:33,676 --> 00:33:36,873
Are there any last-minute sign-ups?

508
00:33:36,946 --> 00:33:41,645
Don't be discouraged, The theater club needs more than singers, It needs fans too,

509
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:43,777
Buy tickets!

510
00:33:43,853 --> 00:33:45,548
Oh, actually,

511
00:33:45,622 --> 00:33:49,558
if you do the part with that particular song, I imagined it much slow...

512
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:52,652
lfwe do the part?

513
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:59,658
Kelsi, my sawed-off Sondheim, I've been in 17 school productions,

514
00:33:59,736 --> 00:34:02,102
How many of your compositions have been selected?

515
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:06,006
- This would be the first, - Which tells us what?

516
00:34:06,075 --> 00:34:10,239
- That I need to write you more solos? - No, It tells us that you do not offer

517
00:34:10,313 --> 00:34:13,578
direction, suggestion or commentary, And you should be thankful

518
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,517
that me and Ryan can lift your music out of its obscurity,

519
00:34:16,586 --> 00:34:18,816
- Are we clear? - Yes, ma'am, I mean, Sharpay,

520
00:34:21,357 --> 00:34:23,791
Nice talking to you,

521
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,919
Any last-minute sign-ups?

522
00:34:27,163 --> 00:34:31,395
- We should go, - No? Good, Done,

523
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:37,897
I'd like to audition, Miss Darbus,

524
00:34:37,974 --> 00:34:41,410
Timeliness means something in the world of theater, young lady,

525
00:34:41,477 --> 00:34:46,813
The individual auditions are long over and there are simply no other pairs,

526
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:48,544
I'll sing with her,

527
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:57,791
Troy Bolton? Where is your sports posse or whatever it's called?

528
00:34:57,861 --> 00:35:00,352
- Team, - Ah,

529
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:03,888
But I'm here alone, Actually, I'm here to sing with her,

530
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:09,303
Yes, well, we take these shows very seriously here at East High,

531
00:35:09,372 --> 00:35:12,364
I called for the pairs audition, and you didn't respond,

532
00:35:12,442 --> 00:35:14,706
Free period is now over,

533
00:35:14,777 --> 00:35:20,773
- She has an amazing voice, - Perhaps the next musicale,

534
00:35:34,664 --> 00:35:37,155
So, you're a composer?

535
00:35:37,233 --> 00:35:40,498
You wrote the song Ryan and Sharpay just sang?

536
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,902
And the entire show?

537
00:35:42,972 --> 00:35:44,496
Well, that's really cool,

538
00:35:44,574 --> 00:35:48,374
I can't wait to hear the rest of the show,

539
00:35:49,646 --> 00:35:52,547
So, why are you so afraid of Ryan and Sharpay?

540
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:54,742
- I mean, it is your show, - It is?

541
00:35:54,817 --> 00:35:58,514
Isn't the composer of a show kind of like the playmaker in basketball?

542
00:35:58,588 --> 00:36:00,146
Playmaker?

543
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:02,418
The one who makes everyone else look good,

544
00:36:02,492 --> 00:36:05,859
Without you there is no show, You're the playmaker here, Kelsi,

545
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:07,897
I am?

546
00:36:07,964 --> 00:36:11,024
Do you wanna hear how the duet's supposed to sound?

547
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:31,785
& It's hard to believe that I couldn't see

548
00:36:31,854 --> 00:36:35,483
& You were always there beside me

549
00:36:35,558 --> 00:36:40,894
& Thought I was alone with no one to hold

550
00:36:40,964 --> 00:36:44,092
& But you were always right beside me

551
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:48,604
& This feeling's like no other

552
00:36:48,671 --> 00:36:52,004
& I want you to know

553
00:36:52,075 --> 00:36:57,980
& That I've never had someone that knows me like you do

554
00:36:58,047 --> 00:37:00,607
& The way you do

555
00:37:00,683 --> 00:37:06,622
& And I've never had someone as good for me as you

556
00:37:06,689 --> 00:37:10,056
& No one like you

557
00:37:10,126 --> 00:37:15,723
& So lonely before I finally found

558
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:20,497
& What I've been looking for

559
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:26,472
& Ooh-ooh-ooh

560
00:37:32,782 --> 00:37:35,478
Wow, That's nice,

561
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:37,849
Bolton, Montez - you have a callback,

562
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,447
Kelsi, give them the duet from the second act,

563
00:37:41,524 --> 00:37:43,617
- Work on it with them, - All right,

564
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:47,629
If you guys wanna rehearse, I'm usually here during free period and after school,

565
00:37:47,697 --> 00:37:51,861
and even sometimes during biology class, You can come and rehearse anytime,

566
00:37:51,934 --> 00:37:55,665
Or come to my house for breakfast, I have a piano, we can rehearse there,

567
00:37:55,738 --> 00:37:58,935
After school, before school - whatever works, After basketball class...

568
00:37:59,976 --> 00:38:00,965
What?

569
00:38:01,044 --> 00:38:05,071
(Sharpay) Callback?! Aah!

570
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:10,341
"Callback for roles Arnold and Minnie next Thursday, 3:30pm,

571
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,381
Ryan and Sharpay Evans, Gabriella Montez and Troy Bolton,"

572
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:18,427
Is this some kind of joke? They didn't even audition!

573
00:38:18,494 --> 00:38:20,325
- Maybe we're being punked? - What?

574
00:38:20,396 --> 00:38:23,854
Maybe we're being filmed right now, Maybe we'll get to meet Ashton!

575
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:26,060
Oh, shut up, Ryan!

576
00:38:26,135 --> 00:38:29,104
What's wrong?

577
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,708
(Chad) What?

578
00:38:36,245 --> 00:38:37,803
Uhh!

579
00:38:42,485 --> 00:38:45,682
How dare she sign up! I picked out the colors for my dressing room,

580
00:38:45,755 --> 00:38:48,781
She hasn't even asked our permission to join the drama club,

581
00:38:49,992 --> 00:38:52,984
- Someone's gotta tell her the rules, - Exactly,

582
00:38:54,197 --> 00:38:57,189
- And what are the rules? - Ohh!

583
00:39:11,481 --> 00:39:17,078
& You can bet there's nothin' but net when I am in a zone and on a roll

584
00:39:17,153 --> 00:39:19,849
& But I got a confession, my own secret obsession

585
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:23,221
& And it's making me lose control

586
00:39:23,292 --> 00:39:27,058
& Everybody gather 'round

587
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,428
If Troy can tell his secret, then I can tell mine,

588
00:39:29,499 --> 00:39:31,558
- I bake, - What?

589
00:39:31,634 --> 00:39:34,933
I love to bake! Strudels, scones, even apple pandowdy,

590
00:39:35,004 --> 00:39:36,995
& Not another sound

591
00:39:37,073 --> 00:39:40,133
Someday I hope to make the perfect creme brulee,

592
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:44,168
& No, no, no, no! No, no, no

593
00:39:44,247 --> 00:39:46,807
& Stick to the stuff you know

594
00:39:46,883 --> 00:39:50,114
& If you wanna be cool follow one simple rule

595
00:39:50,186 --> 00:39:53,280
& Don't mess with the flow no, no

596
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:56,484
& Stick to the status quo

597
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:01,758
& Look at me and what do you see? Intelligence beyond compare

598
00:40:01,831 --> 00:40:04,959
& But inside I am stirring, something strange is occurring

599
00:40:05,034 --> 00:40:07,696
& It's a secret I need to share

600
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:11,729
& Open up, dig way down deep

601
00:40:11,807 --> 00:40:17,268
Hip-hop is my passion, I love to pop and lock and jam and break!

602
00:40:17,346 --> 00:40:18,540
Is that even legal?

603
00:40:18,614 --> 00:40:20,479
& Not another peep!

604
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,314
It's just dancing, I think it's cooler than homework,

605
00:40:23,386 --> 00:40:27,789
& No, no, no, no! No, no, no

606
00:40:27,857 --> 00:40:30,655
& Stick to the stuff you know

607
00:40:30,726 --> 00:40:33,490
& It is better by far to keep things as they are

608
00:40:33,563 --> 00:40:36,555
& Don't mess with the flow, no, no

609
00:40:36,632 --> 00:40:40,068
& Stick to the status quo

610
00:40:40,136 --> 00:40:45,039
& Listen well, I'm ready to tell about a need that I cannot deny

611
00:40:45,107 --> 00:40:48,372
& Dude, there's no explanation for this awesome sensation

612
00:40:48,444 --> 00:40:51,709
& But I'm ready to let it fly

613
00:40:51,781 --> 00:40:54,716
& Speak your mind and you'll be heard

614
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,150
If Troy wants to be a singer, then I'm coming clean,

615
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,656
- I play the cello! - Awesome! What is it?

616
00:41:01,123 --> 00:41:04,149
- A saw! - No, dude, it's like, a giant violin!

617
00:41:04,227 --> 00:41:05,990
& Not another word

618
00:41:06,062 --> 00:41:08,895
- Do you have to wear a costume? - Coat and tie,

619
00:41:08,965 --> 00:41:12,765
& No, no, no, no! No, no, no

620
00:41:12,835 --> 00:41:15,497
& Stick to the stuff you know

621
00:41:15,571 --> 00:41:18,506
& If you wanna be cool, follow one simple rule

622
00:41:18,574 --> 00:41:21,873
& Don't mess with the flow, no, no

623
00:41:21,944 --> 00:41:24,936
& Stick to the status quo

624
00:41:25,014 --> 00:41:27,107
& No, no, no

625
00:41:27,183 --> 00:41:30,619
& Stick to the stuff you know

626
00:41:30,686 --> 00:41:33,246
& It is better by far to keep things as they are

627
00:41:33,322 --> 00:41:36,621
& Don't mess with the flow, no, no

628
00:41:36,692 --> 00:41:39,456
& Stick to the status quo

629
00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:06,553
& This is not what I want

630
00:42:06,622 --> 00:42:09,591
& This is not what I planned

631
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:12,526
& And I just gotta say

632
00:42:12,595 --> 00:42:15,826
& I do not understand

633
00:42:15,898 --> 00:42:19,061
& Something is really

634
00:42:19,135 --> 00:42:24,437
- & Something's not right - & Really wrong

635
00:42:24,507 --> 00:42:30,776
& And we've gotta get things back where they belong

636
00:42:30,846 --> 00:42:32,108
- & We can do it - & Gotta play

637
00:42:32,181 --> 00:42:34,513
- & Stick with what you know - & We can do it

638
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:36,710
- & Hip-hop hooray - & She has got to go

639
00:42:36,786 --> 00:42:38,219
- & We can do it - & Creme Brulee

640
00:42:38,287 --> 00:42:40,050
& Keep your voice down low

641
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:41,521
- & Not another peep - & No

642
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,182
- & Not another word - & No

643
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:44,453
- & Not another sound - & No

644
00:42:44,527 --> 00:42:48,327
& Everybody quiet!

645
00:42:49,198 --> 00:42:50,961
Why is everybody staring at you?

646
00:42:51,033 --> 00:42:53,627
- Not me, you, - Because of the callbacks?

647
00:42:53,703 --> 00:42:55,933
I can't have people staring at me, I can't,

648
00:42:56,005 --> 00:42:58,132
& No! No, no, no

649
00:42:58,207 --> 00:43:01,608
& Stick to the stuff you know

650
00:43:01,677 --> 00:43:04,237
& If you want to be cool, follow one simple rule

651
00:43:04,313 --> 00:43:07,805
& Don't mess with the flow, no, no

652
00:43:07,883 --> 00:43:10,818
& Stick to the status quo

653
00:43:10,886 --> 00:43:13,684
& No, no, no

654
00:43:13,756 --> 00:43:16,281
& Stick to the stuff you know

655
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:19,294
& It is better by far to keep things as they are

656
00:43:19,362 --> 00:43:22,388
& Don't mess with the flow, no, no

657
00:43:22,465 --> 00:43:25,696
& Stick to the status stick to the status

658
00:43:25,768 --> 00:43:28,236
& Stick to the status quo

659
00:43:28,971 --> 00:43:31,565
(all gasping)

660
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,108
(Sharpay) Aah!

661
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,901
I am so sorry,

662
00:43:38,914 --> 00:43:40,609
You do not want to get into that, man,

663
00:43:40,683 --> 00:43:42,344
- Too much drama, - Yeah,

664
00:43:42,418 --> 00:43:44,886
What is going on here?

665
00:43:44,954 --> 00:43:48,253
Look at this! That Gabriella girl just dumped her lunch on me!

666
00:43:48,324 --> 00:43:51,760
On purpose! It's all part of their plan to ruin our musical,

667
00:43:51,827 --> 00:43:55,319
And Troy and his basketball robots are obviously behind it,

668
00:43:55,398 --> 00:43:57,161
Why do you think he auditioned?

669
00:43:57,233 --> 00:44:01,192
After all the hard work you've put into this show,

670
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:03,636
It just doesn't seem right,

671
00:44:07,076 --> 00:44:10,807
- What's up? - What's up? Oh, let's see...

672
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,179
You missed free-period workout to audition for a heinous musical,

673
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:16,718
And now suddenly people are confessing,

674
00:44:17,353 --> 00:44:21,255
Yeah, and Zeke, Zeke is baking... creme brulee,

675
00:44:21,323 --> 00:44:22,312
What's that?

676
00:44:22,391 --> 00:44:24,757
Oh, a creamy custard with a caramelized surface,

677
00:44:24,827 --> 00:44:28,593
- It's really satisfying, - Shut up, Zeke!

678
00:44:28,664 --> 00:44:32,100
Look... do you see what's happening here, man?

679
00:44:32,168 --> 00:44:35,228
Our team is coming apart because of your singing thing,

680
00:44:35,304 --> 00:44:38,933
Even the drama geeks and the brainiacs suddenly think that they can...

681
00:44:39,008 --> 00:44:40,066
... talk to us,

682
00:44:40,142 --> 00:44:42,872
- Look, the skater dudes are mingling, - Yo!

683
00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:45,675
Suddenly people think that they can do other stuff,

684
00:44:45,748 --> 00:44:48,114
Stuff that's not their stuff,

685
00:44:48,184 --> 00:44:54,419
You're thinking about show tunes, when we've got a playoff game next week,

686
00:45:02,298 --> 00:45:03,287
Whoa!

687
00:45:03,365 --> 00:45:04,832
Whoa!

688
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,562
- Ooh! - (boy) Head's up!

689
00:45:19,515 --> 00:45:23,815
- All right, Cards on the table right now, - Huh?

690
00:45:23,886 --> 00:45:27,822
You're tweaked because I put your stars in detention and now you're getting even,

691
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,585
What are you talking about, Darbus?

692
00:45:29,658 --> 00:45:32,286
Your all-star son turned up at my audition,

693
00:45:32,361 --> 00:45:35,125
Now, I give every student an even chance,

694
00:45:35,197 --> 00:45:38,428
which is a long and honorable tradition in the theater,

695
00:45:38,501 --> 00:45:41,163
Something that you wouldn't understand,

696
00:45:41,237 --> 00:45:46,766
But, if he is planning some sort of practical joke in my chapel of the arts...

697
00:45:46,842 --> 00:45:50,334
- Troy doesn't even sing, - Oh, well, you're wrong about that,

698
00:45:50,412 --> 00:45:56,282
But I will not allow my Twinkle Town musicale to be made into farce,

699
00:45:56,352 --> 00:46:00,482
- Twinkle Town? - See? I knew it!

700
00:46:00,556 --> 00:46:04,117
- Hey... - I knew it!

701
00:46:04,193 --> 00:46:07,321
Sounds like a winner, Good luck on Broadway!

702
00:46:09,765 --> 00:46:12,859
Is Sharpay really, really mad at me? I said I was sorry,

703
00:46:12,935 --> 00:46:16,496
Look, no one has beaten out Sharpay for a musical since kindergarten,

704
00:46:16,572 --> 00:46:18,563
I wasn't trying to beat anyone out,

705
00:46:18,641 --> 00:46:20,973
We didn't even audition, we were just singing,

706
00:46:21,043 --> 00:46:23,238
You won't convince Sharpay of that,

707
00:46:23,312 --> 00:46:27,578
If that girl could play both Romeo and Juliet, her own brother would be aced out,

708
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:32,053
I told you it just happened, but I liked it,

709
00:46:32,121 --> 00:46:34,021
A lot,

710
00:46:34,089 --> 00:46:37,081
Did you ever feel like there's a whole other person inside you

711
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:40,754
just looking for a way to come out?

712
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:44,321
Not really, No,

713
00:46:45,401 --> 00:46:46,766
(bell ringing)

714
00:46:46,835 --> 00:46:48,268
Let's go,

715
00:46:50,573 --> 00:46:53,974
Hey, Sharpay, I thought since Troy Bolton's gonna be in your show...

716
00:46:54,043 --> 00:46:56,443
Troy Bolton is not in my show,

717
00:46:56,512 --> 00:47:00,573
OK, um... well, I thought maybe you could watch me play ball sometime,

718
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:06,551
- I'd rather stick pins in my eyes, - Wouldn't that be awfully uncomfortable?

719
00:47:06,622 --> 00:47:08,385
Evaporate, tall person!

720
00:47:10,392 --> 00:47:12,451
I bake!

721
00:47:12,528 --> 00:47:15,361
If that helps,

722
00:47:38,387 --> 00:47:44,553
- Wow! It's like a jungle up here, - Yeah, just like that cafeteria,

723
00:47:44,627 --> 00:47:47,425
Well, I just humiliated myself into the next century,

724
00:47:47,496 --> 00:47:50,590
- No! Come on, - So this is your private hideout?

725
00:47:50,666 --> 00:47:55,228
Yeah, Thanks to the science club, Which means my buddies don't know it exists,

726
00:47:55,304 --> 00:47:58,273
You pretty much have the school wired, don't you, Troy?

727
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,776
Seems to me like everyone on campus wants to be your friend,

728
00:48:01,844 --> 00:48:04,142
Unless we lose,

729
00:48:04,213 --> 00:48:06,579
Well, I'm sure it's tricky being the coach's son,

730
00:48:06,649 --> 00:48:10,449
Makes me practice a little harder, I guess,

731
00:48:11,353 --> 00:48:13,617
I don't know what he'll say about the singing,

732
00:48:13,689 --> 00:48:17,785
- You worried? - My parents friends are always saying,

733
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:24,959
"Your son's the basketball guy, You must be so proud,"

734
00:48:27,202 --> 00:48:30,968
Sometimes I don't wanna be the "basketball guy."

735
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,474
I just wanna be a guy, You know?

736
00:48:34,343 --> 00:48:37,904
I saw the way you treated Kelsi at the audition yesterday,

737
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,710
Do your friends know that guy?

738
00:48:40,783 --> 00:48:43,752
To them, I'm the playmaker dude,

739
00:48:43,819 --> 00:48:45,719
They don't know enough about you, Troy,

740
00:48:45,788 --> 00:48:49,451
At my other schools I was the freaky math girl,

741
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:54,326
It's cool coming here and being... anyone I wanna be,

742
00:48:54,396 --> 00:48:57,957
When I was singing with you I just felt like... a girl,

743
00:48:58,033 --> 00:49:00,365
You even look like one, too,

744
00:49:04,807 --> 00:49:09,176
Remember in kindergarten how you'd meet a kid and know nothing about them,

745
00:49:09,244 --> 00:49:11,838
then ten seconds later you play like you're best friends

746
00:49:11,914 --> 00:49:14,815
because you didn't have to be anything but yourself,

747
00:49:14,883 --> 00:49:17,351
- Yeah, - Singing with you felt like that,

748
00:49:19,088 --> 00:49:24,321
Well, uh... I never thought about singing, That's for sure,

749
00:49:24,393 --> 00:49:26,452
Till you,

750
00:49:26,528 --> 00:49:30,259
So you really wanna do the callbacks?

751
00:49:30,332 --> 00:49:33,529
Hey, just call me freaky callback boy,

752
00:49:35,637 --> 00:49:37,764
You're a cool guy, Troy,

753
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,037
But not for the reasons your friends think,

754
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:44,546
And thanks for showing me your top-secret hiding place,

755
00:49:44,613 --> 00:49:47,013
Like kindergarten,

756
00:49:48,016 --> 00:49:49,313
(bell ringing)

757
00:49:49,384 --> 00:49:51,011
(both sigh)

758
00:50:07,569 --> 00:50:13,667
& We're soarin', we're flyin'...

759
00:50:13,742 --> 00:50:15,767
(Troy singing)

760
00:50:24,186 --> 00:50:25,619
& Breaking...

761
00:50:34,496 --> 00:50:38,626
& Creating space between us...

762
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:17,430
& There's not a star in heaven that we...

763
00:51:17,506 --> 00:51:19,906
& Flyin'

764
00:51:19,975 --> 00:51:24,207
& There's not a star in heaven that we...

765
00:51:24,279 --> 00:51:25,268
(whistle blows)

766
00:51:25,347 --> 00:51:29,477
Let's go, guys! Make it sharp! To the chest, come on! Pop it!

767
00:51:29,551 --> 00:51:32,145
Come on, guys, Step with it! Let's go!

768
00:51:32,221 --> 00:51:34,621
Come on, move it! Let's go!

769
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:37,989
Come on, guys, focus! Focus! Get your head in the game!

770
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,527
Move it!

771
00:51:40,462 --> 00:51:44,296
- You seen Troy? - No... Coach,

772
00:51:44,366 --> 00:51:46,129
(blows whistle) Again, let's go!

773
00:52:08,757 --> 00:52:09,746
(whistle blows)

774
00:52:09,825 --> 00:52:14,262
That's it, guys, Let's hit the showers, Good hustle, Let's see that in the game,

775
00:52:18,233 --> 00:52:22,169
I, uh,, think I'm gonna stay a while, Work on some free throws,

776
00:52:22,237 --> 00:52:26,936
Since you missed practice, I think your team deserves a little effort from you today,

777
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:40,146
Wow, So this is your real stage,

778
00:52:40,222 --> 00:52:42,588
Yeah, I guess you could call it that,

779
00:52:42,658 --> 00:52:44,888
Or just a smelly gym,

780
00:52:47,963 --> 00:52:49,362
Whoa!

781
00:52:49,431 --> 00:52:51,661
Don't tell me you're good at hoops, too,

782
00:52:51,733 --> 00:52:54,861
You know, I once scored 41 points at a league championship game,

783
00:52:54,937 --> 00:52:57,064
- No way, - Mm-hm, And the same day,

784
00:52:57,139 --> 00:52:59,573
I invented the space shuttle and microwave popcorn,

785
00:52:59,641 --> 00:53:02,906
Oh! Microwave popcorn, Ha-ha, Funny,

786
00:53:06,515 --> 00:53:11,384
- I've been rehearsing with Kelsi, - Me, too, And, by the way,

787
00:53:11,453 --> 00:53:15,219
I missed practice, So if I get kicked off the team it'll be on your conscience,

788
00:53:15,924 --> 00:53:19,155
- Hey, I wasn't the one who told you... - Gabriella, chill,

789
00:53:20,963 --> 00:53:23,864
Hey, that's traveling, No, that's really bad traveling,

790
00:53:23,932 --> 00:53:25,126
(laughing)

791
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,694
Miss! I'm sorry, this is a closed practice,

792
00:53:29,771 --> 00:53:32,672
- Dad, practice is over, - Not till the last player leaves,

793
00:53:32,741 --> 00:53:35,039
- Team rule, - Oh, I'm sorry, sir,

794
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:39,444
- Dad, this is Gabriella Montez, - Ah, your detention buddy,

795
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:44,145
I'll see you later, Troy,

796
00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:46,380
Nice meeting you, Coach Bolton,

797
00:53:47,889 --> 00:53:49,584
You as well, Miss Montez,

798
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,592
Dad, detention was my fault, not hers,

799
00:53:54,663 --> 00:53:58,463
You haven't missed practice in three years, That girl shows up...

800
00:53:58,533 --> 00:54:02,333
That girl is named Gabriella, She's very nice,

801
00:54:02,404 --> 00:54:05,635
Helping you miss practice doesn't make her very nice, Not in my book,

802
00:54:05,707 --> 00:54:07,732
- Or your team's, - Dad, she's not a problem,

803
00:54:07,809 --> 00:54:12,303
- She's just a girl, - But you're not just a guy, Troy,

804
00:54:12,381 --> 00:54:14,781
You're the team leader,

805
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:18,513
What you do effects not only this team, but the entire school,

806
00:54:18,587 --> 00:54:23,957
And without you completely focused, we're not gonna win next week,

807
00:54:24,026 --> 00:54:27,462
The championship games - they don't come along all the time,

808
00:54:27,529 --> 00:54:32,466
- They're something special, - Yeah, a lot of things are special, Dad,

809
00:54:32,534 --> 00:54:36,971
But you're a playmaker... not a singer, right?

810
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:41,066
Did you ever think maybe I could be both?

811
00:54:50,919 --> 00:54:54,150
- What? - Let's go,

812
00:54:55,757 --> 00:54:59,386
What spell has this elevated-IQ temptress girl cast

813
00:54:59,461 --> 00:55:01,656
that suddenly makes you wanna be in musical?

814
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:03,664
Look, I just did it, Who cares?

815
00:55:03,732 --> 00:55:07,327
Who cares? How about your most loyal best friend?

816
00:55:07,402 --> 00:55:11,236
- Quiet in here, Mr, Danforth, - It's him, Miss Falsaff, not me,

817
00:55:11,306 --> 00:55:16,972
Look, you're a hoops dude, not a musical singer person,

818
00:55:17,045 --> 00:55:19,275
Have you seen Michael Crawford on a cereal box?

819
00:55:19,347 --> 00:55:23,010
- Who's Michael Crawford? - Exactly my point,

820
00:55:23,085 --> 00:55:25,747
He was the Phantom of the Opera on Broadway,

821
00:55:25,821 --> 00:55:29,416
Now my mom, she's seen that musical 27 times,

822
00:55:29,491 --> 00:55:32,153
and put Michael Crawford's picture in our refrigerator,

823
00:55:32,227 --> 00:55:34,821
Yeah, not on it, in it,

824
00:55:34,896 --> 00:55:39,196
So my point is, if you play basketball, you're gonna end up on the cereal box,

825
00:55:39,267 --> 00:55:42,236
If you're in musicals, you'll end up in my mom's refrigerator,

826
00:55:42,304 --> 00:55:43,999
Why in her refrigerator?

827
00:55:44,072 --> 00:55:49,237
One of her crazy diet ideas, I won't attempt to understand the female mind,

828
00:55:49,311 --> 00:55:51,575
It's foreign territory,

829
00:55:55,117 --> 00:56:00,214
How can you expect the rest of us to be focused on a game if you're off somewhere

830
00:56:00,288 --> 00:56:02,085
in leotards singing "Twinkle Town"?

831
00:56:02,157 --> 00:56:04,182
No one said anything about leotards,

832
00:56:04,259 --> 00:56:06,489
Not yet, my friend, but just you wait,

833
00:56:06,561 --> 00:56:09,257
Look, we need you, Captain, Big time,

834
00:56:09,331 --> 00:56:13,324
- Mr, Danforth, - I tried to tell him, Miss Falsaff,

835
00:56:13,401 --> 00:56:15,869
Really tried,

836
00:56:19,808 --> 00:56:22,003
Something isn't right,

837
00:56:24,779 --> 00:56:29,375
- Hey, look, We need to talk, - Go,

838
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:35,056
They must be trying to figure out a way to make sure Troy and Gabriella beat us out,

839
00:56:35,123 --> 00:56:38,456
The jocks rule most of the school, but if they get Troy into a musical,

840
00:56:38,527 --> 00:56:41,519
then they've conquered the entire student body,

841
00:56:41,596 --> 00:56:45,828
And if those science girls get Gabriella hooked up with Troy Bolton,

842
00:56:45,901 --> 00:56:49,701
the scholastic club goes from drool to cool,

843
00:56:49,771 --> 00:56:53,138
Ryan, we need to save our show from people who don't know the difference

844
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:56,939
between a Tony Award and Tony Hawk,

845
00:56:58,813 --> 00:57:00,303
Do you think that'll work?

846
00:57:00,382 --> 00:57:03,943
It's the only way to save Troy and Gabriella from themselves,

847
00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:05,043
- So we on? - Yeah,

848
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,920
- Good, So we start tomorrow then, - OK, the first thing,

849
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:12,357
- Nice, Let's go, - Cool,

850
00:57:22,237 --> 00:57:24,296
(bell ringing)

851
00:57:24,372 --> 00:57:27,466
So, my watch is 7:45 Mountain Standard time, We synched?

852
00:57:27,542 --> 00:57:30,534
- Whatever, - Then we're on go mode for lunch, 12:05,

853
00:57:30,612 --> 00:57:35,140
Yes, Chad, we're a go, But we're not Charlie's Angels, OK?

854
00:57:35,217 --> 00:57:37,276
I can dream, can't I?

855
00:57:40,188 --> 00:57:42,053
(bell ringing)

856
00:57:54,536 --> 00:57:58,700
"Spider" Bill Netrine, class of '72,

857
00:57:58,773 --> 00:58:01,037
He was the MVP in the league championship game,

858
00:58:01,109 --> 00:58:06,775
Sam Nedler, class of '02, Also known as "Sammy Slamma Jamma."

859
00:58:06,848 --> 00:58:10,579
Captain, MVP of the league championship team,

860
00:58:10,652 --> 00:58:13,712
The "Thunder Clap," Hap Hadden, '95,

861
00:58:13,788 --> 00:58:16,518
Led the Wildcats to back-to-back city championships,

862
00:58:16,591 --> 00:58:19,651
- A legend, - Yes, Legends, one and all,

863
00:58:19,728 --> 00:58:24,188
But do you think that any of these Wildcat legends became legends

864
00:58:24,266 --> 00:58:28,760
by getting involved in musical auditions days before the league championships?

865
00:58:28,837 --> 00:58:30,998
- Get your head in the game! - No,

866
00:58:31,072 --> 00:58:32,869
These Wildcat legends became legends

867
00:58:32,941 --> 00:58:35,273
because they never took their eye off the prize,

868
00:58:35,343 --> 00:58:37,243
Get your head in the game!

869
00:58:37,312 --> 00:58:41,112
Who was the first sophomore ever to make starting varsity?

870
00:58:41,182 --> 00:58:44,015
- Troy! - Who voted him team captain this year?

871
00:58:44,085 --> 00:58:47,418
- Us! - And who is gonna get their butts kicked

872
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:50,720
in Friday's championship game if Troy's worried about an audition?

873
00:58:50,792 --> 00:58:52,987
- We are, - Guys, come on,

874
00:58:53,061 --> 00:58:55,029
There's 12 people on this team, not just me,

875
00:58:55,096 --> 00:58:57,792
Just 12? Oh, no,

876
00:58:57,866 --> 00:59:03,805
I think you're forgetting about one very important 13th member of our squad,

877
00:59:06,641 --> 00:59:09,201
- My dad, - Yes, Troy,

878
00:59:09,277 --> 00:59:13,338
Wildcat basketball champion, class of 1981,

879
00:59:13,415 --> 00:59:18,546
Champion, father, and now coach,

880
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:21,783
It's a winning tradition like no other,

881
00:59:21,856 --> 00:59:26,259
From lowly Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon, to early warriors, medieval knights,

882
00:59:26,328 --> 00:59:29,627
All leading up to...

883
00:59:29,698 --> 00:59:31,666
... lunkhead basketball man,

884
00:59:31,733 --> 00:59:35,829
Yes, our culture worshiped the aggressor throughout the ages

885
00:59:35,904 --> 00:59:38,873
and we end up with spoiled, overpaid bonehead athletes

886
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:43,934
who contribute little to civilization other than slam dunks and touchdowns,

887
00:59:44,012 --> 00:59:49,177
That is the inevitable world of Troy Bolton,

888
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:52,083
But the path of the mind, the path we're on,

889
00:59:52,153 --> 00:59:54,951
ours is the path that has brought us these people:

890
00:59:56,157 --> 01:00:00,321
Eleanor Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo, Sandra Day O'Connor,

891
01:00:00,395 --> 01:00:03,558
Madame Curie, Jane Goodall, Oprah Winfrey

892
01:00:03,631 --> 01:00:06,600
and so many others who the world reveres,

893
01:00:06,668 --> 01:00:11,628
Uh, but, what is...? I've got Kelsi waiting for me to rehearse,

894
01:00:11,706 --> 01:00:13,765
Gabriella!

895
01:00:13,842 --> 01:00:17,073
Troy Bolton represents one side of evolution,

896
01:00:17,145 --> 01:00:20,808
And our side, the side of education and accomplishment

897
01:00:20,882 --> 01:00:24,045
is the future of civilization!

898
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:26,986
This is the side where you belong,

899
01:00:28,022 --> 01:00:33,392
Guys, if you don't know that I'll put a 110% of my guts into that game,

900
01:00:33,461 --> 01:00:34,723
then you don't know me,

901
01:00:34,796 --> 01:00:37,697
- But we just thought... - I'll tell you what I thought,

902
01:00:37,766 --> 01:00:42,066
I thought that you're my friends, Win together, lose together, teammates,

903
01:00:42,137 --> 01:00:47,040
- But suddenly the girl... and the singing, - Man, I'm for the team!

904
01:00:47,108 --> 01:00:50,305
I've always been for the team, She's just someone I met,

905
01:00:50,378 --> 01:00:54,280
All right the singing thing is nothing. A way to keep my nerves down.

906
01:00:54,349 --> 01:00:58,285
It means nothing to me. You're my guys and this is our team.

907
01:00:58,353 --> 01:01:00,321
Gabriella is not important.

908
01:01:00,388 --> 01:01:05,519
I'll forget about her, forget the audition and we'll get that championship.

909
01:01:05,593 --> 01:01:06,924
Everyone happy now?

910
01:01:06,995 --> 01:01:10,021
Behold lunkhead basketball man,

911
01:01:13,234 --> 01:01:18,763
So, Gabriella, we'd love to have you for the scholastic decathlon,

912
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,206
Did you wanna grab some lunch?

913
01:01:22,544 --> 01:01:25,012
Well, we'll be there if you wanna come,

914
01:01:27,015 --> 01:01:28,846
- Wildcats! - Get your head in the game!

915
01:01:28,917 --> 01:01:29,906
Whoo!

916
01:01:31,019 --> 01:01:34,682
- Let's go! - (girl) Go, Wildcats!

917
01:01:34,756 --> 01:01:36,724
& Everybody sing out

918
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:40,659
& Wildcats everywhere wave your hands up in the air

919
01:01:40,728 --> 01:01:44,858
& That's the way we do it let's get to it, time to show the world

920
01:01:44,933 --> 01:01:48,926
& Wildcats, sing along, they really got it going on

921
01:01:49,003 --> 01:01:52,962
& Wildcats in the house everybody sing out

922
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:57,000
& Wildcats everywhere, wave your hands up in the air...

923
01:01:57,078 --> 01:01:59,808
(team) Troy, Troy, Troy...

924
01:01:59,881 --> 01:02:04,181
& It's funny when you find yourself

925
01:02:04,252 --> 01:02:07,881
& Looking from the outside

926
01:02:08,189 --> 01:02:15,686
& I'm standing here but all I want is to be over there

927
01:02:15,763 --> 01:02:20,462
& Why did I let myself believe

928
01:02:20,535 --> 01:02:23,766
& Miracles could happen?

929
01:02:23,938 --> 01:02:31,936
& 'Cause now I have to pretend that I don't really care

930
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:36,016
& I thought you were my fairy tale

931
01:02:36,084 --> 01:02:40,145
& A dream when I'm not sleeping

932
01:02:40,221 --> 01:02:47,855
& A wish upon a star that's coming true

933
01:02:47,929 --> 01:02:52,025
& But everybody else could tell

934
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:55,934
& That I confused my feelings with the truth

935
01:02:58,273 --> 01:03:02,733
& When there was me and you

936
01:03:04,345 --> 01:03:12,081
& I swore I knew the melody that I heard you singing

937
01:03:12,153 --> 01:03:20,117
& And when you smiled you made me feel like I could sing along

938
01:03:20,194 --> 01:03:24,858
& But then you went and changed the words

939
01:03:24,933 --> 01:03:28,027
& Now my heart is empty

940
01:03:28,102 --> 01:03:35,133
& I'm only left with used-to-bes and once upon a song

941
01:03:35,777 --> 01:03:40,146
& Now I know your not a fairy tale

942
01:03:40,214 --> 01:03:44,116
& And dreams were meant for sleeping

943
01:03:44,185 --> 01:03:51,887
& And wishes on a star just don't come true

944
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:56,363
& 'Cause now even I can tell

945
01:03:56,431 --> 01:04:02,529
& That I confused my feelings with the truth

946
01:04:02,604 --> 01:04:06,335
& 'Cause I liked the view

947
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:10,434
& When there was me and you

948
01:04:10,511 --> 01:04:15,312
& I can't believe that I could be so blind

949
01:04:15,383 --> 01:04:19,376
& It's like you were floating while I was falling

950
01:04:19,454 --> 01:04:26,758
& And I didn't mind

951
01:04:30,331 --> 01:04:38,204
& Because I liked the view, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh

952
01:04:38,272 --> 01:04:42,072
& I thought you felt it too

953
01:04:42,143 --> 01:04:47,410
& When there was me and you

954
01:04:51,185 --> 01:04:53,585
(students chattering)

955
01:04:59,761 --> 01:05:02,491
Hey, how you doin'?

956
01:05:03,164 --> 01:05:04,927
I wanna talk to you about something,

957
01:05:04,999 --> 01:05:08,662
And here it is: I know what it's like to carry a load with your friends,

958
01:05:08,736 --> 01:05:13,173
I get it, You've got your boys, Troy, It's OK, So we're good,

959
01:05:13,241 --> 01:05:15,971
Good about what? I wanna talk about the final callbacks,

960
01:05:16,044 --> 01:05:18,911
I don't wanna do the callbacks either,

961
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:22,916
Who are we trying to kid? You've got your team and I've got mine,

962
01:05:22,984 --> 01:05:26,420
I'll do the scholastic decathlon and you'll win the championships,

963
01:05:26,487 --> 01:05:29,388
It's where we belong,

964
01:05:29,457 --> 01:05:31,823
- Go, Wildcats, - But I...

965
01:05:31,893 --> 01:05:33,918
Me neither,

966
01:05:33,995 --> 01:05:36,361
(horn blows)

967
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:38,262
Gabriella?

968
01:05:38,332 --> 01:05:40,095
(horn)

969
01:05:40,168 --> 01:05:42,534
Go Wildcats!

970
01:05:44,372 --> 01:05:47,000
Hey, Captain!

971
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:55,141
- What's with Troy? - Don't worry about it,

972
01:05:57,385 --> 01:05:59,853
(grunting)

973
01:06:14,368 --> 01:06:16,029
(frustrated grunt)

974
01:06:48,369 --> 01:06:49,768
Oh, hey!

975
01:07:01,649 --> 01:07:03,844
- Troy! Hey, - Hey, Troy!

976
01:07:26,207 --> 01:07:28,198
Hey, um...

977
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:31,440
We just had another team meeting,

978
01:07:31,512 --> 01:07:33,412
Oh... wonderful,

979
01:07:33,481 --> 01:07:37,474
We had a team meeting about how we haven't been acting like a team,

980
01:07:37,552 --> 01:07:39,782
I mean us, not you,

981
01:07:39,854 --> 01:07:43,119
- About the singing thing... - I don't even wanna talk about it,

982
01:07:43,191 --> 01:07:45,682
We just want you to know that we're gonna be there,

983
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,887
- Cheering for you, - Huh?

984
01:07:47,962 --> 01:07:49,520
If singing is what you wanna do,

985
01:07:49,597 --> 01:07:51,588
we should boost you up, not tear you down,

986
01:07:51,666 --> 01:07:54,260
Yeah, Win or lose, we're teammates,

987
01:07:54,335 --> 01:07:58,772
That's what we're about, Even if you turn out to be the worst singer in the world,

988
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,741
Which we don't know, because we haven't heard you sing,

989
01:08:01,809 --> 01:08:04,334
You're not gonna hear me sing, guys,

990
01:08:04,412 --> 01:08:07,973
Because Gabriella won't even talk to me...

991
01:08:08,049 --> 01:08:10,449
... and I don't know why,

992
01:08:13,254 --> 01:08:15,950
We do,

993
01:08:16,023 --> 01:08:17,957
I baked these fresh today,

994
01:08:18,025 --> 01:08:21,756
You'll probably want to try one before we tell you the rest,

995
01:08:21,829 --> 01:08:24,297
Gabriella, we were jerks,

996
01:08:24,365 --> 01:08:27,630
No, we were worse than jerks because we were mean jerks,

997
01:08:27,702 --> 01:08:30,034
We thought Troy and the whole singing thing was

998
01:08:30,104 --> 01:08:32,800
killing our chances of having you on the scholastic decathlon team,

999
01:08:32,874 --> 01:08:35,672
I heard what he had to say, I'm on your team now, Done,

1000
01:08:35,743 --> 01:08:38,541
No, not done,

1001
01:08:38,613 --> 01:08:40,843
We knew that Chad could get Troy to say things

1002
01:08:40,915 --> 01:08:44,009
to make you want to forget about the callbacks,

1003
01:08:44,085 --> 01:08:46,679
We planned it, and we're embarrassed and sorry,

1004
01:08:46,754 --> 01:08:51,054
No one forced Troy to say anything, And you know what? It's OK,

1005
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:54,117
We should prepare for the decathlon, it's time to move on,

1006
01:08:54,195 --> 01:08:56,823
No, it's not OK,

1007
01:08:56,898 --> 01:09:03,303
The decathlon is whatever, but how you feel about us, and even more, Troy -

1008
01:09:03,371 --> 01:09:06,135
- that's what really matters,

1009
01:09:13,547 --> 01:09:14,536
(whispers) We tried,

1010
01:09:21,622 --> 01:09:23,613
(dog barking)

1011
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:36,536
Hi, uh... Just came to say I'm sorry,

1012
01:09:37,104 --> 01:09:43,270
- Hi, Miss Montez, I'm Troy Bolton, - Oh, Troy!

1013
01:09:44,078 --> 01:09:45,170
(mouths) No,

1014
01:09:45,246 --> 01:09:51,845
Um... Gabriella is kind of busy with homework, so now's not a good time,

1015
01:09:51,919 --> 01:09:58,256
I made a mistake, Miss Montez, and I would really like to let Gabriella know that,

1016
01:09:58,326 --> 01:10:05,232
- Could you tell her I came by to see her? - I will... Troy,

1017
01:10:05,299 --> 01:10:07,130
- Good night, - Good night, Thank you,

1018
01:10:23,918 --> 01:10:26,045
(phone beeping)

1019
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:29,385
(phone ringing in receiver)

1020
01:10:29,457 --> 01:10:32,290
(phone ringing)

1021
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:41,493
- Hello? - What you heard, none of that is true,

1022
01:10:41,569 --> 01:10:45,027
I was sick of my friends riding me, so I said things to shut them up,

1023
01:10:45,106 --> 01:10:46,266
I didn't mean any of it,

1024
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:49,138
You sounded pretty convincing to me.

1025
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:53,977
The guy you met on vacation is more me than the guy who said those stupid things,

1026
01:10:54,048 --> 01:10:56,516
The whole singing thing is making the school whack,

1027
01:10:56,584 --> 01:11:00,384
You said so yourself, Everyone's treating you differently because of it,

1028
01:11:00,454 --> 01:11:03,218
Maybe because I don't wanna only be the basketball guy.

1029
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:07,727
They can't handle it. That's not my problem, it's theirs.

1030
01:11:07,795 --> 01:11:10,628
- How about your dad? - And it's not about my dad.

1031
01:11:10,698 --> 01:11:14,566
This is about how I feel, and I'm not letting the team down.

1032
01:11:14,635 --> 01:11:16,865
They let me down.

1033
01:11:16,937 --> 01:11:20,839
So I'm gonna sing. What about you?

1034
01:11:20,908 --> 01:11:25,641
- I don't know, Troy, - Well, you need to say yes.

1035
01:11:25,713 --> 01:11:28,477
Because I brought you something.

1036
01:11:28,549 --> 01:11:31,177
What do you mean?

1037
01:11:31,252 --> 01:11:33,243
Turn around.

1038
01:11:43,731 --> 01:11:49,761
& This could be the start of something new

1039
01:11:49,837 --> 01:11:55,298
& It feels so right to be here with you

1040
01:11:55,376 --> 01:11:57,310
& Oh

1041
01:11:57,378 --> 01:12:01,712
& And now lookin' in your eyes

1042
01:12:01,782 --> 01:12:06,310
& I feel in my heart

1043
01:12:06,387 --> 01:12:10,118
& The start of something...

1044
01:12:10,191 --> 01:12:12,022
... new

1045
01:12:15,296 --> 01:12:18,993
It's a pairs audition,

1046
01:12:34,415 --> 01:12:38,215
(whistle blows, players yelling)

1047
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:50,290
Whoo,

1048
01:12:51,532 --> 01:12:53,261
Yeah!

1049
01:12:53,334 --> 01:12:56,633
Zn4, and by doing that, you end up with two...

1050
01:12:56,704 --> 01:12:58,968
... and two, Got it?

1051
01:13:01,108 --> 01:13:03,076
Yes!

1052
01:13:06,447 --> 01:13:08,108
What's happening?

1053
01:13:17,992 --> 01:13:20,483
Come here, Go ahead and put five grams of this in,

1054
01:13:20,561 --> 01:13:23,223
and that causes it to change from an acidic state,

1055
01:13:23,297 --> 01:13:25,925
Causing the color to change from pink to blue,

1056
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,264
Just like those pH strips,

1057
01:13:28,335 --> 01:13:31,236
Oh, gotta go, See you guys later!

1058
01:13:44,318 --> 01:13:46,081
Whoa!

1059
01:13:46,754 --> 01:13:48,779
You're late!

1060
01:13:48,856 --> 01:13:52,952
(both) &... strength to believe

1061
01:13:53,027 --> 01:13:55,359
& We're soarin'

1062
01:13:55,429 --> 01:13:57,624
& Flyin'

1063
01:13:57,698 --> 01:14:02,362
& There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach

1064
01:14:02,436 --> 01:14:03,903
& Bop bop bop...

1065
01:14:03,971 --> 01:14:05,700
(Troy) & If we're tryin'

1066
01:14:05,773 --> 01:14:07,832
(both) & Yeah, we're breakin' free

1067
01:14:07,908 --> 01:14:09,102
(gasps)

1068
01:14:09,176 --> 01:14:12,043
Wow, They sound good,

1069
01:14:12,112 --> 01:14:13,739
(scoffs)

1070
01:14:16,183 --> 01:14:19,550
& Like a wave the ocean just...

1071
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:21,918
We have to do something,

1072
01:14:21,989 --> 01:14:24,014
OK, our callbacks on Thursday

1073
01:14:24,091 --> 01:14:28,687
and the basketball game and scholastic decathlon are on Friday,

1074
01:14:28,762 --> 01:14:31,697
Too bad all these events weren't happening on the same day...

1075
01:14:31,765 --> 01:14:34,233
... at the same time,

1076
01:14:35,202 --> 01:14:40,139
That wouldn't work out because then Troy and Gabriella wouldn't be able to make...

1077
01:14:42,676 --> 01:14:44,871
I'm proud to call you my sister,

1078
01:14:44,945 --> 01:14:48,039
I know,

1079
01:14:48,115 --> 01:14:51,573
(Darbus) I don't want to hear any more about Troy and that Montez girl,

1080
01:14:51,652 --> 01:14:57,488
So, if you're telling me as co-presidents of the drama club that changing the callbacks

1081
01:14:57,558 --> 01:15:03,724
would be what's best for our theater program, I might actually agree with you,

1082
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:11,269
Is that a yes?

1083
01:15:13,574 --> 01:15:15,235
& Bop bop bop, up to the top

1084
01:15:15,309 --> 01:15:17,243
& And wipe away your inhibitions

1085
01:15:17,311 --> 01:15:20,940
& Stomp, stomp, stomp do the romp and strut your stuff

1086
01:15:21,015 --> 01:15:23,415
& Bop bop bop, straight to the top...

1087
01:15:33,727 --> 01:15:37,026
(Chad) No problem at all, It was crazy, man,

1088
01:15:39,033 --> 01:15:40,591
Callbacks the same time as the game?

1089
01:15:40,668 --> 01:15:43,466
- And the scholastic decathlon, - Why would they do that?

1090
01:15:43,537 --> 01:15:47,439
- I smell a rat named Darbus, - I think two rats, neither named Darbus,

1091
01:15:47,508 --> 01:15:50,602
Do you know something about this, small person?

1092
01:15:50,678 --> 01:15:52,805
Miss Darbus thinks she's protecting the show,

1093
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,145
but Ryan and Sharpay are only concerned with protecting themselves,

1094
01:15:56,216 --> 01:15:58,309
Do you know what I'll do to those two show dogs?

1095
01:15:58,385 --> 01:16:00,683
Nothing, We're not gonna do anything to them,

1096
01:16:00,754 --> 01:16:02,619
Except to sing, maybe,

1097
01:16:02,690 --> 01:16:05,386
Now this is only gonna happen if we all work together,

1098
01:16:05,459 --> 01:16:09,054
- Now who's in? - You know I'm in,

1099
01:16:24,778 --> 01:16:26,769
(classroom chatter)

1100
01:16:28,248 --> 01:16:30,580
- A pi pie, - (gasps)

1101
01:16:30,651 --> 01:16:32,278
- Oh, my goodness! - Oh, my gosh!

1102
01:16:32,353 --> 01:16:35,880
What? Thank you!

1103
01:16:35,956 --> 01:16:39,790
- Oh, we have something for you too, - Yeah, come here, look,

1104
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:41,259
(both) Ta-da!

1105
01:16:41,328 --> 01:16:44,695
Oh... it's an equation,

1106
01:16:47,067 --> 01:16:49,194
Oh!

1107
01:16:49,269 --> 01:16:50,600
That's awful!

1108
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:04,980
Stay right there, Watch,

1109
01:17:05,052 --> 01:17:06,815
From our team, to yours,

1110
01:17:06,887 --> 01:17:11,950
G - O - D - R - A - M - A- C- L - U - B

1111
01:17:12,025 --> 01:17:13,014
Exclamation point,

1112
01:17:13,093 --> 01:17:18,793
Well, seems we Wildcats are in for an interesting afternoon,

1113
01:17:18,866 --> 01:17:19,764
Go,

1114
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:25,669
G-O-D... dra,, Go dra... Go dray...

1115
01:17:25,739 --> 01:17:27,502
- Ugh! - Drame?

1116
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:31,071
(bell ringing, students yelling)

1117
01:17:38,252 --> 01:17:41,278
(rhythmic clapping)

1118
01:17:52,733 --> 01:17:55,566
How you feeling?

1119
01:17:55,636 --> 01:17:58,571
- Nervous, - Yeah, me too,

1120
01:17:58,639 --> 01:18:03,633
- Wish I could suit up and play with you, - Hey, you had your turn,

1121
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:07,670
You know what I want from you today?

1122
01:18:07,748 --> 01:18:10,911
- The championship, - Well, that'll come or it won't,

1123
01:18:10,984 --> 01:18:14,010
What I want is for you to have fun,

1124
01:18:14,087 --> 01:18:19,047
I know all about the pressure, Probably too much of it has come from me,

1125
01:18:19,126 --> 01:18:24,462
What I really want is to see my son having the time of his life

1126
01:18:24,531 --> 01:18:28,592
playing the game we both love,

1127
01:18:28,669 --> 01:18:35,700
You give me that, and I will sleep with a smile on my face no matter what the score,

1128
01:18:38,278 --> 01:18:40,838
Thanks, Coach... uh...

1129
01:18:41,348 --> 01:18:43,043
... Dad,

1130
01:18:47,387 --> 01:18:49,753
(cheering, drummers drumming)

1131
01:18:57,364 --> 01:19:00,094
(announcer) Welcome to the tenth annual Scholastic Decathlon.

1132
01:19:00,167 --> 01:19:03,136
The East High Wildcats versus the West High Knights.

1133
01:19:07,207 --> 01:19:09,937
Hello! Right here, right here,

1134
01:19:18,051 --> 01:19:19,382
(vocal gibberish)

1135
01:19:19,453 --> 01:19:21,751
- Mah, mah, mah! - Mah, mah, mah!

1136
01:19:21,822 --> 01:19:23,847
- Eeh! Eeh! - Ow! Ow!

1137
01:19:23,924 --> 01:19:25,050
Stop!

1138
01:19:28,762 --> 01:19:30,753
- I trust you, - Energy,

1139
01:19:36,169 --> 01:19:38,160
- (all) Whoo! - Come on, let's do it,

1140

1141
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:47,979
Let's go! Go!

1142
01:19:49,249 --> 01:19:53,117
...for this championship game between East High and West High!

1143
01:20:02,362 --> 01:20:06,890
Casting the leads of a show is both a challenge and a responsibility,

1144
01:20:06,967 --> 01:20:09,231
A joy and a burden,

1145
01:20:09,303 --> 01:20:13,740
I commend you and all other young artists to hold out

1146
01:20:13,807 --> 01:20:19,507
for the moon, the sun and the stars,

1147
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:22,344
Shall we soar together?

1148
01:20:24,751 --> 01:20:26,719
Sharpay and Ryan!

1149
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:32,617
Mucho gusto!

1150
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:36,395
Ay, que fabulosa!

1151
01:20:37,064 --> 01:20:38,861
(trills tongue) Ay! Ay! Ay!

1152
01:20:38,932 --> 01:20:42,993
- Arriba! - Quien es bailar?

1153
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:44,765
& Me la me

1154
01:20:44,838 --> 01:20:48,604
& I believe in dreamin', shootin' for the stars

1155
01:20:48,675 --> 01:20:52,736
& Baby to be number one you've got to raise the bar

1156
01:20:52,813 --> 01:20:57,113
& Kickin' and a scratchin', grindin' out my best

1157
01:20:57,184 --> 01:21:00,585
& Anything it takes to climb the ladder of success

1158
01:21:00,654 --> 01:21:05,751
(both) & Work our tails off every day

1159
01:21:05,826 --> 01:21:09,922
& Gotta bump the competition blow them all away

1160
01:21:09,997 --> 01:21:12,795
- & Caliente! - & Suave!

1161
01:21:12,866 --> 01:21:14,265
& Yeah we're gonna

1162
01:21:14,334 --> 01:21:15,892
& Bop, bop, bop bop to the top

1163
01:21:15,969 --> 01:21:18,096
& Slip and slide and ride that rhythm

1164
01:21:18,171 --> 01:21:20,298
& Jump and hop hop till we drop

1165
01:21:20,374 --> 01:21:22,535
& And start again

1166
01:21:22,609 --> 01:21:24,338
& Zip zap zop pop like a mop

1167
01:21:24,411 --> 01:21:26,311
& Scoot around the corner

1168
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:30,009
& Move it to the groove till the music stops

1169
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:32,916
& Do the bop bop, bop to the top

1170
01:21:32,986 --> 01:21:37,116
& Don't ever stop bop to the top

1171
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:39,090
& Gimme, gimme, shimmy, shimmy

1172
01:21:39,159 --> 01:21:41,184
Wildcats!

1173
01:21:42,262 --> 01:21:46,028
(announcer)... the coveted championship trophy!

1174
01:21:47,801 --> 01:21:49,769
(cheerleaders cheering in background)

1175
01:21:49,836 --> 01:21:50,825
(blows whistle)

1176
01:21:51,905 --> 01:21:55,363
East High wins the opening tip, pushing the ball up the court.

1177
01:22:02,049 --> 01:22:03,346
(ding)

1178
01:22:13,593 --> 01:22:15,925
(man) East High,

1179
01:22:15,996 --> 01:22:18,294
We did it!

1180
01:22:19,099 --> 01:22:20,191
Great job!

1181
01:22:20,267 --> 01:22:24,465
& Shake some booty and turn around

1182
01:22:24,538 --> 01:22:26,506
& Flash a smile in their direction

1183
01:22:26,573 --> 01:22:27,665
& Show some muscle

1184
01:22:27,741 --> 01:22:29,732
& Do the Hustle

1185
01:22:36,316 --> 01:22:40,548
All right, Wildcats, time for an orderly exit from the gym,

1186
01:22:46,993 --> 01:22:48,585
(buzzing)

1187
01:22:59,005 --> 01:23:03,669
And West High pushes the ball around the perimeter on the offensive end.

1188
01:23:03,744 --> 01:23:06,406
Nice ball movement by West High.

1189
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,505
Driving the lane...

1190
01:23:08,582 --> 01:23:11,073
shot is up and...

1191
01:23:11,151 --> 01:23:13,085
(buzzer sounds)

1192
01:23:13,153 --> 01:23:15,917
We seem to be experiencing some technical difficulties,

1193
01:23:15,989 --> 01:23:18,321
(whistle)

1194
01:23:18,391 --> 01:23:20,416
We've got a timeout on the court here.

1195
01:23:20,494 --> 01:23:22,792
We have a problem, Stop the game, Stop the game,

1196
01:23:22,863 --> 01:23:25,058
Referee has signaled timeout.

1197
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,400
Everyone please remain calm.

1198
01:23:41,815 --> 01:23:43,009
Go, go, go, go,

1199
01:23:46,953 --> 01:23:51,515
We'll get this figured out real soon, In the meantime, per safety regulations,

1200
01:23:51,591 --> 01:23:55,425
we need to all make an orderly exit from the gym, please,

1201
01:23:55,495 --> 01:23:57,360
Thank you,

1202

1204
01:24:03,103 --> 01:24:04,730
& Stump, stump, stump do the romp

1205
01:24:04,805 --> 01:24:06,932

1206
01:24:07,007 --> 01:24:08,941
& Bop, bop, bop straight to the top

1207
01:24:09,009 --> 01:24:10,806
& Going for the glory

1208
01:24:10,877 --> 01:24:16,509
& We'll keep stepping up and we just won't stop, stop

1209
01:24:16,583 --> 01:24:19,416
& Till we reach the top

1210
01:24:19,486 --> 01:24:21,818
& Bop to the top

1211
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:24,356
(applause)

1212
01:24:33,867 --> 01:24:36,631
Oh, hi! Call me,

1213
01:24:38,138 --> 01:24:43,508
Do you see why we love the theater, people? Well done!

1214
01:24:43,577 --> 01:24:48,674
Ah, Troy Bolton, Gabriella Montez,

1215
01:24:48,748 --> 01:24:50,477
Troy? Gabriella?

1216
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:53,417
- They'll be here, - The theater, as I have often pointed out,

1217
01:24:53,486 --> 01:24:57,217
waits for no one, I'm sorry,

1218
01:24:58,124 --> 01:24:59,921
Well, we are done here,

1219
01:24:59,993 --> 01:25:03,622
Congratulations to all, The cast list will be posted,

1220
01:25:03,697 --> 01:25:06,029
Wait! Miss Darbus, wait!

1221
01:25:06,099 --> 01:25:09,557
- We're ready, we can sing, - I called your names, twice,

1222
01:25:09,636 --> 01:25:13,629
- Miss Darbus, please! Please! - Rules are rules!

1223
01:25:13,707 --> 01:25:17,234
(students murmur)

1224
01:25:18,111 --> 01:25:21,080
We'll be happy to do it again for our fellow students,

1225
01:25:21,147 --> 01:25:24,913
I don't know what's going on here, but in any event,

1226
01:25:24,985 --> 01:25:27,613
it's far too late and we have not got a pianist,

1227
01:25:27,687 --> 01:25:30,417
- Well, that's show biz, - We'll sing without a piano,

1228
01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:33,323
Oh, no, you won't, Pianist here, Miss Darbus,

1229
01:25:33,393 --> 01:25:37,022
- You really don't wanna do that, - Oh, yes, I really do,

1230
01:25:37,097 --> 01:25:38,894
Ready on stage,

01:25:39,399 --> 01:25:43,665
Now that's show biz,

1232
01:25:54,681 --> 01:25:57,013
(Kelsi plays intro)

1233
01:26:10,964 --> 01:26:13,933
I can't do it, Troy, not with all these people staring at me,

1234
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,730
Hey, hey, look at me, right at me,

1235
01:26:16,803 --> 01:26:21,763
Right at me, Like the first time we sang together, Remember?

1236
01:26:22,642 --> 01:26:24,303
Like kindergarten,

1237
01:26:36,122 --> 01:26:40,786
& We're soarin', flyin'

1238
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:46,821
& There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach

1239
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:51,269
& If we're trying so we're breaking free

1240
01:26:54,441 --> 01:26:59,276
& You know the world can see us

1241
01:26:59,346 --> 01:27:03,214
& In a way that's different than who we are

1242
01:27:03,283 --> 01:27:09,483
& Creating space between us till we're separate hearts

1243
01:27:12,025 --> 01:27:19,796
& But your faith it gives me strength strength to believe

1244
01:27:19,866 --> 01:27:22,892
- & We're breakin' free - & We're soarin'

1245
01:27:22,969 --> 01:27:25,403
& Flyin'

1246
01:27:25,472 --> 01:27:31,035
& There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach

1247
01:27:31,111 --> 01:27:33,238
& If we're tryin'

1248
01:27:33,313 --> 01:27:35,508
& Yeah, we're breakin' free

1249
01:27:35,582 --> 01:27:38,949
- & Oh, we're breakin' free - & Oh

1250
01:27:39,019 --> 01:27:43,581
& Can you feel it building

1251
01:27:43,656 --> 01:27:47,854
& Like a wave the ocean just can't control

1252
01:27:47,927 --> 01:27:52,990
& Connected by a feeling Ooh, in our very soul

1253
01:27:53,066 --> 01:27:56,058
