1
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,364
MOVER: We're here! Time to muscle up.

2
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,016
Hello?

3
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,282
Who's there?

4
00:04:56,897 --> 00:05:00,128
You scared me to death, you mangy thing.

5
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:05,460
I'm just looking for an old well. Know it?

6
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,769
Not talking, huh?

7
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,278
Magic dowser, magic dowser,

8
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:18,110
Show me the well!

9
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,289
Get away from me!

10
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,166
Ooh.

11
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:45,611
Let me guess. You're from Texas or Utah, someplace dried-out and barren, right?

12
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,773
I heard about water witching before, but it doesn't make sense.

13
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,512
- I mean, it's just an ordinary branch. - It's a dowsing rod.

14
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:53,644
Ow!

15
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:58,556
And I don't like being stalked, not by psycho nerds or their cats!

16
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:02,392
He's not really my cat. He's kind of feral. You know, wild.

17
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:04,590
Of course, I do feed him every night,

18
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:08,658
and sometimes he'll come to my window and bring me little dead things.

19
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:11,034
Look, I'm from Pontiac.

20
00:06:11,272 --> 00:06:12,398
Huh?

21
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:17,740
Michigan. And if I'm a water witch, then where's the secret well?

22
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,580
You stomp too hard and you'll fall in it.

23
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:21,706
Oh!

24
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:25,741
See?

25
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:30,354
It's supposed to be so deep, if you fell to the bottom and looked up,

26
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:33,916
you'd see a sky full of stars in the middle of the day.

27
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:35,353
Ha!

28
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:38,426
Surprised she let you move in.

29
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:42,833
My gramma, she owns the Pink Palace. Won't rent to people with kids.

30
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,737
What do you mean?

31
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:49,265
(STAMMERING) I'm not supposed to talk about it. I'm Wybie. Wybie Lovat.

32
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,104
- Wybie? - Short for Wyborne.

33
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,812
Not my idea, of course. What'd you get saddled with?

34
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:58,977
I wasn't saddled with anything. It's Coraline.

35
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:02,514
- Caroline what? - Coraline. Coraline Jones.

36
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,821
(SCOFFS) It's not real scientific, but I heard an ordinary name like Caroline

37
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:09,294
can lead people to have ordinary expectations about a person.

38
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,091
LOVAT: Wyborne!

39
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,794
I think I heard someone calling you, Wyborne.

40
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:20,329
- What? I didn't hear anything. - I definitely heard someone,

41
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,741
Why-Were-You-Born.

42
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:26,043
- LOVAT: Wyborne! - Grandma!

43
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:33,344
Well, great to meet a Michigan water witch,

44
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:36,788
but I'd wear gloves next time.

45
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:40,690
- Why? - 'Cause that dowsing rod of yours,

46
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,160
it's poison oak.

47
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:16,525
I almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom.

48
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:17,859
Uh-huh.

49
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:19,832
I would've died.

50
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:22,235
That's nice.

51
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,360
Hmm.

52
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:27,537
So, can I go out? I think it's perfect weather for gardening.

53
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:30,839
No, Coraline. Rain makes mud. Mud makes a mess.

54
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:34,681
But, Mom, I want stuff growing when my friends come to visit.

55
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,682
Isn't that why we moved here?

56
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,618
Something like that. But then we had the accident.

57
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:44,255
- It wasn't my fault you hit that truck. - I never said it was.

58
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,916
I can't believe it.

59
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:49,156
You and Dad get paid to write about plants, and you hate dirt.

60
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:52,027
Coraline, I don't have time for you right now,

61
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:55,694
and you still have unpacking to do. Lots of unpacking.

62
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,294
(SARCASTICALLY) That sounds exciting!

63
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,597
Oh. Some kid left this on the front porch.

64
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:07,308
WYBIE. ; Hey, Jonesy. Look what I found in Gramma's trunk.

65
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,508
Look familiar? Wybie.

66
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,580
CORALINE: Huh.

67
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:17,487
A little me? That's weird.

68
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,282
What's his name, anyway?

69
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,294
Wybie. And I'm way too old for dolls.

70
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,565
Hey, Dad. How's the writing going?

71
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:34,665
Dad!

72
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:39,744
Hello, Coraline and Coraline doll.

73
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:44,283
Do you know where the garden tools are?

74
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:47,184
It's... It's pouring out there, isn't it?

75
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:51,749
- It's just raining. - What'd the boss say?

76
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:55,317
"Don't even think about going out, Coraline Jones!"

77
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,493
Then you won't need the tools.

78
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:12,836
You know, this house is 150 years old.

79
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:16,046
- So? - So explore it.

80
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,916
Go out and count all the doors and windows and write that down on...

81
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:23,479
List everything that's blue. Just let me work.

82
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,260
Ew!

83
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,288
No. No, no, no. No.

84
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:19,997
One boring blue boy in a painfully boring painting.

85
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:25,411
Four incredibly boring windows

86
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:29,212
and no more doors.

87
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:35,287
All right, little me. Where are you hiding?

88
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:45,358
Huh?

89
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:52,599
Hey, Mom. Where does this door go?

90
00:12:52,673 --> 00:12:55,369
I'm really, really busy.

91
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,841
CORALINE: I think it's locked.

92
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,405
Please!

93
00:13:09,423 --> 00:13:13,018
Will you stop pestering me if I do this for you?

94
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,120
Fine.

95
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,643
Bricks? I don't get it.

96
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:39,909
They must've closed this off when they divided up the house.

97
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,978
You're kidding. And why is the door so small?

98
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:45,923
We made a deal! Zip it!

99
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:49,253
You didn't lock it.

100
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,905
Oh, my twitchy-witchy girl

101
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:04,171
I think you are so nice I give you bowls of porridge

102
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:05,370
And I give you bowls of ice cream

103
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,847
Why don't you ever cook, Mom?

104
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:10,678
Coraline, we've been through this before.

105
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:14,312
Your dad cooks, I clean, and you stay out of the way.

106
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:18,790
I swear I'll go food shopping soon as we finish the catalog.

107
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,054
Try some of the chard. You need a vegetable.

108
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,426
It looks more like slime to me.

109
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:28,025
Well, it's slime or bedtime, fusspot. Now what's it gonna be?

110
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,902
Think they're trying to poison me?

111
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,416
Don't forget about me, guys. Okay?

112
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,336
Good night, little me.

113
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,262
Whoa!

114
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:30,545
Huh?

115
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,501
Mmm. Something smells good.

116
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:57,641
Mom? What are you doing here in the middle of the night?

117
00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:00,311
You're just in time for supper, dear.

118
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,948
You're not my mother. My mother doesn't have...

119
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,464
Buttons? Do you like them?

120
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,727
I'm your other mother, silly.

121
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:18,100
Now go tell your other father that supper's ready.

122
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,706
Well, go on. He's in his study.

123
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,810
CORALINE: Hello?

124
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:34,120
Hello, Coraline.

125
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,322
Wanna hear my new song?

126
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:40,987
- My father can't play piano. - No need to.

127
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,525
This piano plays me.

128
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:53,071
Making up a song about Coraline

129
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:57,075
She's a peach, she's a doll She's a pal of mine

130
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:59,976
She's as cute as a button in the eyes of everyone

131
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:04,210
Who ever laid their eyes on Coraline

132
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:08,518
When she comes around exploring Mom and I will never, ever make it boring

133
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:12,615
Our eyes will be on Coraline

134
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:17,891
I'm sorry, but she said to tell you the food's ready.

135
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:18,953
Mmm.

136
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:21,000
Who's starving? Raise your hand.

137
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,056
Whoa!

138
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:40,419
We give our thanks and ask to bless our mother's golden chicken breast.

139
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:52,660
Mmm!

140
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:55,929
- CORALINE: This chicken is good. - Hungry, aren't you?

141
00:18:57,137 --> 00:19:00,834
- Do you have any gravy? - Well, here comes the gravy train.

142
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,670
Choo, choo!

143
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:11,307
Huh.

144
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:14,820
Another roll? Sweet peas? Corn on the cob?

145
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,350
I'm real thirsty.

146
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:21,587
Of course. Any requests?

147
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:23,487
Mango milkshake?

148
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:41,343
- Home? - We've been waiting for you, Coraline.

149
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:43,212
- For me? - OTHER FATHER: Yep.

150
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,843
Wasn't the same here without you, kiddo.

151
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,648
I didn't know I had another mother.

152
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,553
Of course you do. Everyone does.

153
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:52,424
- Really? - OTHER MOTHER: Uh-huh.

154
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:56,326
And soon as you're through eating, I thought we'd play a game.

155
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,360
You mean like hide-and-seek?

156
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:05,268
Perfect. Hide-and-seek in the rain.

157
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:08,498
What rain?

158
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,174
- What about the mud? - We love mud here.

159
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:16,306
Mud facials, mud baths, mud pies.

160
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:20,414
- It's great for poison oak. - How'd you know I...

161
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:26,318
I... I'd love to play, but I better get home to my other mother.

162
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,360
But I'm your other mother.

163
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:32,831
I mean my other, other mother. Mom number one?

164
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,032
I think I should get to bed.

165
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:39,503
Of course, sweetheart. It's all made up.

166
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,870
- But... - Come along, sleepyhead.

167
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:54,385
- Wow. - DRAGONFLY: Hello, Coraline.

168
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:57,184
DRAGONFLIES: Hello, hello, hello, hello.

169
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,885
- What's shaking, baby? - Hello.

170
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,232
GIRL. ; Hey. How's it going, Loper?

171
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:11,236
Where's your swampers and chook?

172
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:14,102
Cripes almighty! How are my best trolls?

173
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:17,200
I can't wait till summer. You're both coming, right?

174
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:20,371
- We're already here, Coraline. - Gone to Oregon.

175
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,814
CORALINE: Oh.

176
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:26,916
The mud.

177
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,191
- See you soon. - See you soon.

178
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,757
It's gone. My poison oak! It's gone!

179
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,226
Huh.

180
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,037
It was incredibly real, Mom.

181
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:24,076
Only you weren't really you. You were my other mother.

182
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:25,940
Buttons for eyes, huh?

183
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,072
Coraline, you only dreamed you ate all that chicken.

184
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:30,740
Take your multivitamin at least.

185
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:32,079
You were in the dream, too, Dad.

186
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:35,746
You had wild-looking pajamas and orange monkey slippers.

187
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:39,650
Orange? My monkey slippers are blue.

188
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:43,162
Psst! Can you get me some of that magic mud you were talking about?

189
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:46,255
Because I have a terrible case of writer's rash on my...

190
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:52,837
If the real Charlie Jones wants his pages edited,

191
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,100
he better wrap them up ASAP.

192
00:22:57,443 --> 00:23:00,003
Coraline, why don't you go visit downstairs?

193
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,708
I bet those actresses would love to hear your dream.

194
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:07,549
Miss Spink and Forcible? But you said they're dingbats.

195
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:09,051
Mmm-hmm.

196
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,794
Bobinsky. Bobinsky. Bobinsky.

197
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:50,993
Hello?

198
00:23:52,065 --> 00:23:55,296
I think our mail got mixed up.

199
00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:57,268
Should I leave it outside, or...

200
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:09,178
CORALINE: Hmm.

201
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,679
Secret!

202
00:24:14,187 --> 00:24:17,179
Famous jumping mouse circus not ready,

203
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:20,650
little girl.

204
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:22,659
Circus?

205
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:23,887
Oh, uh...

206
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,431
I brought this for you.

207
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:34,431
Huh?

208
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:36,634
New cheese samples.

209
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:45,818
Very clever using this mix-up to sneak my home and peek at mooshkas?

210
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:48,144
- Mooshkas? - The mice!

211
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:50,314
Oh!

212
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,723
Sorry. I'm Coraline Jones.

213
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:56,652
And I am the Amazing Bobinsky.

214
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:01,591
But you call me Mr. B

215
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,659
because amazing I already know that I am.

216
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:12,876
Ha!

217
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:18,679
You see, Caroline, the problem is... My new songs go oompah, oompah,

218
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:22,448
but the jumping mice play only toodle-toot, like that.

219
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:26,117
Is nice but not so much amazing.

220
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:30,856
So now, I switch to stronger cheese and soon, watch out!

221
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:36,958
Here, have beet. Make you strong.

222
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:41,767
Do svidaniya, Caroline.

223
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:45,173
Coraline.

224
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,242
Oompah, oompah. Toodle-toot. Toodle-toot.

225
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,015
Hey, Caroline!

226
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:58,618
Wait!

227
00:25:58,691 --> 00:25:59,817
No!

228
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,358
The mice asked me to give you message.

229
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:09,492
The jumping mice?

230
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:13,938
They are saying do not go through little door.

231
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:17,199
Do you know such a thing?

232
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:22,873
The one behind the wallpaper? But it's all bricked up.

233
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,142
Bah. So sorry. Is nothing.

234
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:29,388
Sometimes the mice are little mixed-up.

235
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:34,517
They even get your name wrong, you know?

236
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:37,688
They call you Coraline instead of Caroline.

237
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:41,756
Not Caroline at all. Maybe I work them too hard.

238
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:23,474
Cease your infernal yapping.

239
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,670
How nice to see you, Caroline.

240
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:29,476
Would you like to come in? We're playing cards.

241
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:31,676
Still Coraline, Miss Spink.

242
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:34,083
Miriam! Put the kettle on!

243
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:48,162
April, I think you're being followed.

244
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:51,897
It's the new neighbor, Miriam. Caroline.

245
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,697
She'll be having the oolong tea.

246
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:58,471
No! Oh, no, no. I'm sure she'd prefer jasmine.

247
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:00,512
No, oolong.

248
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,242
Ah. Jasmine it is, then.

249
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:08,916
Come on, boys.

250
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:18,622
Are those dogs real?

251
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:22,123
Our sweet departed angels.

252
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:26,501
Couldn't bear to part with them, so we had them stuffed.

253
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:29,166
Now, there's Hamish the third...

254
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:31,376
Go on. Have one.

255
00:28:31,444 --> 00:28:36,245
It's hand-pulled taffy from Brighton. Best in the world.

256
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:39,409
SPINK: The third, the ninth, yes. The fourth, I'm right.

257
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:42,784
And Jock Jr., Jock Sr., Jock the third, the fourth,

258
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:46,218
and that's Jock's second cousin thrice removed.

259
00:28:46,993 --> 00:28:49,154
I'll read them if you like.

260
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:53,492
- Read what? - Your tea leaves, dear.

261
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:58,299
They'll tell me your future. Drink up then. Go on.

262
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:03,365
No, not all of it. Not all of it. That's right. Now hand it over.

263
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:08,111
Oh!

264
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:10,315
Oh, Caroline.

265
00:29:10,383 --> 00:29:13,409
Caroline, Caroline, Caroline.

266
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:16,046
You are in terrible danger.

267
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:20,353
Oh, give me that cup, April. Your eyes are going.

268
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:23,657
My eyes? You're blind as a bat.

269
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:27,062
Well, not to worry, child.

270
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:33,396
It's good news. There's a tall, handsome beast in your future.

271
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:35,906
- A what? - Miriam, really.

272
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:40,537
You're holding it wrong. See? Danger.

273
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:41,910
CORALINE: What do you see?

274
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:44,973
SPINK: I see a very peculiar hand.

275
00:29:45,051 --> 00:29:47,144
FORCIBLE: I see a giraffe.

276
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:50,655
Giraffes don't just fall from the sky, Miriam.

277
00:29:50,723 --> 00:29:51,781
Oh, Lord.

278
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:55,323
Well, what should I do?

279
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:57,862
Never wear green in your dressing room.

280
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,490
Acquire a very tall stepladder.

281
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:02,864
And be very, very careful.

282
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,603
Now, was there something you came to tell us?

283
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:12,940
No. I guess not. Thanks for the tea, though.

284
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:15,207
FORCIBLE: Toodle-oo. SPINK: Cheery-bye.

285
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,181
FORCIBLE: Do you have any nice queens for Mummy?

286
00:30:22,455 --> 00:30:23,649
Danger?

287
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:44,336
Great! The village stalker.

288
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,468
Ow!

289
00:30:46,112 --> 00:30:49,707
I wasn't stalking you. We're hunting banana slugs.

290
00:30:49,782 --> 00:30:51,511
What do you mean "we?"

291
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:58,117
Ha! Your cat's not wild. He's a wuss puss.

292
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,091
What? He hates to get his feet wet. Jeez.

293
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,491
Wuss puss.

294
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:10,561
So, that doll. Did you make it look like me?

295
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:13,161
Oh, no. I found it that way.

296
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:17,302
It's older than Grandma. Old as this house, probably.

297
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:21,107
Come on. Blue hair, my swampers and raincoat?

298
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,411
Dang! Check out Slugzilla.

299
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:28,317
You're just like them.

300
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:29,846
Huh?

301
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:33,085
I meant my parents. They don't listen to me either.

302
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:34,786
Uh-huh. You mind?

303
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:42,595
Hmm.

304
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:43,726
Ew!

305
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:54,312
You know, I've never been inside the Pink Palace.

306
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,007
You're kidding.

307
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:59,847
Grandma'd kill me. Thinks it's dangerous or something.

308
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,210
Dangerous?

309
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:05,621
- Well, she had a twin sister. - So?

310
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:09,590
When they were kids, Grandma's sister disappeared.

311
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:11,687
She says she was stolen.

312
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:13,563
CORALINE: Stolen?

313
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,696
Well, what do you think?

314
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:20,435
I don't know. Maybe she just ran away.

315
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,564
LOVAT: Wyborne!

316
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:26,209
- Look, I gotta go. - Wait a minute.

317
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:44,279
- Welcome back, darling. - Hi.

318
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,917
So thoughtful of you to send this nice cheddar, Coraline.

319
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:51,588
Cheddar? Oh! The mice bait.

320
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:56,768
Would you go fetch your father? I bet he's hungry as a pumpkin by now.

321
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,200
You mean my other father.

322
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:02,172
Your better father, dear. He's out in the garden.

323
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:04,266
But my parents don't have time to garden.

324
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:07,770
Mmm!

325
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:09,336
Go on.

326
00:34:39,712 --> 00:34:40,736
Oh!

327
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:02,298
Hey.

328
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:05,264
I love your garden!

329
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:08,262
Our garden, Coraline.

330
00:35:12,745 --> 00:35:14,406
Stop tickling me!

331
00:35:16,382 --> 00:35:18,179
Daughter in distress.

332
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:34,295
Tickle no more, you dragon snappers.

333
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:41,298
Well, she says it's time for dinner, breakfast, food.

334
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,833
Hop on, kiddo. I wanna show you something.

335
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,179
CORALINE: I can't believe you did this.

336
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:59,121
OTHER FATHER: Mother said you'd like it.

337
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:02,388
Boy, she knows you like the back of her hand.

338
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:07,664
Mmm. So good.

339
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:10,293
I love dinner-breakfast-food.

340
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:12,564
Coraline, Mr. Bobinsky has invited you

341
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:15,300
to come see the jumping mice perform after dinner.

342
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:19,572
Really? That know-it-all Wybie said it was all in Mr. B's head.

343
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:20,839
I knew he was wrong.

344
00:36:20,913 --> 00:36:23,609
Well, everything's right in this world, kiddo.

345
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:28,745
Your father and I will clean up while you and your friend head upstairs.

346
00:36:28,821 --> 00:36:30,186
My friend?

347
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:37,124
Great. Another Wybie. Hello, Why-Were-You-Born.

348
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:40,560
Hello!

349
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:45,836
I thought you'd like him more if he spoke a little less. So I fixed him.

350
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:49,899
- So he can't talk at all? - Nope.

351
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:51,368
Hmm.

352
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:52,774
I like it.

353
00:36:52,845 --> 00:36:55,473
Now, run along, you two, and have fun.

354
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:02,986
You're awful cheerful considering you can't say anything.

355
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:08,286
It didn't hurt, did it, when she...

356
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:22,569
CORALINE: Whoa!

357
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,538
Cool!

358
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,654
CORALINE: Look at you!

359
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,637
OTHER BOBINSKY: Lady and gentleman, for to tickle your eyes and ears

360
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:56,737
and making hearts to thump,

361
00:37:56,808 --> 00:38:00,539
I, Sergei Alexander Bobinsky,

362
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,945
am introducing my astoundishing,

363
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,681
stupendulous and amazing

364
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:12,447
jumping mouse circus!

365
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:17,289
My name!

366
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,850
It's wonderful, Wybie.

367
00:38:58,003 --> 00:38:59,061
Wow!

368
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:21,620
Yahoo! That was great!

369
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,119
Very, very thank you, lady and gentleman.

370
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:46,345
We loved it, Mr. B. It was so... So...

371
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:47,783
Ah...

372
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:49,013
Amazing!

373
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:54,491
You are very welcome anytime you like. You and also your good friend there.

374
00:39:55,027 --> 00:39:57,257
Do svidaniya, Coraline.

375
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:44,105
CORALINE: There were garden squash like balloon animals and snapdragons.

376
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:47,543
Oh, and upstairs, I saw a real mouse circus.

377
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,103
Not pretend like the crazy man's in our house.

378
00:40:50,182 --> 00:40:51,809
You sure you won't come?

379
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:54,750
Don't fret, Charlie. They'll love the new catalog.

380
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,811
At least they'll love my chapters.

381
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:59,948
I did not call him crazy, Coraline. He's drunk.

382
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:03,795
Well, I guess I'll see you around, you dizzy dreamer.

383
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:06,660
Dad! I'm not five anymore.

384
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:36,015
My kingdom for a horse!

385
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:50,035
Put them back.

386
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:55,808
But, Mom, the whole school's gonna wear boring gray clothes. No one will have these.

387
00:41:56,448 --> 00:41:58,006
Put them back.

388
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,952
My other mother would get them.

389
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,648
Maybe she should buy all your clothes.

390
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,255
CORALINE: So what do you think is in the other apartment?

391
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:15,095
I don't know. Not a family of Jones imposters.

392
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:17,965
- Then why'd you lock the door? - Oh!

393
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:22,370
I found some rat crap, and I thought you'd feel safer.

394
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:27,401
They're jumping mice, Mom, and the dreams aren't dangerous.

395
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:30,539
They're the most fun I've had since we've moved here.

396
00:42:30,615 --> 00:42:34,847
- Your school might be fun. - With those stupid uniforms? Right.

397
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:37,951
Had to give it a try.

398
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:55,199
How do you feel about a mustard, ketchup, salsa wrap for lunch?

399
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:57,002
Are you kidding me?

400
00:42:57,476 --> 00:43:02,243
Had to go food shopping, anyway. Dad's planning something special.

401
00:43:02,314 --> 00:43:04,179
Grossgusting.

402
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:07,082
You wanna come along? You can pick out something you like.

403
00:43:07,152 --> 00:43:09,120
Oh. Like the gloves.

404
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:15,191
Look, Coraline, if things go well today, I promise I'll make it up.

405
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,853
That's what you always say.

406
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:22,656
Won't be long.

407
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:25,570
But I might be.

408
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:07,806
I knew it was real.

409
00:44:31,403 --> 00:44:32,927
O THER MO THER. ; Dearest Coraline,

410
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:37,134
Miss Spink and Miss Forcible have invited you downstairs after lunch.

411
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:40,974
I hope you like the new outfit I made you. Love, Mother.

412
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,350
Wybie's got a cat like you at home.

413
00:44:57,529 --> 00:45:00,794
Not the quiet Wybie. The one that talks too much.

414
00:45:01,633 --> 00:45:03,828
You must be the other cat.

415
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:07,895
No, I'm not the other anything. I'm me.

416
00:45:08,506 --> 00:45:11,304
Um... I can see you don't have button eyes,

417
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:14,937
but if you're the same cat, how can you talk?

418
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:17,514
I just can.

419
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,983
Cats don't talk at home.

420
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,416
- No? - Nope.

421
00:45:21,486 --> 00:45:25,252
Well, you're clearly the expert on these things.

422
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:28,884
After all, I'm just a big fat wuss puss.

423
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:34,126
Come back. Please? I'm sorry I called you that. I really am.

424
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:35,496
How'd you get here?

425
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:38,229
I've been coming here for a while.

426
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:43,137
It's a game we play.

427
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:47,602
She hates cats and tries to keep me out,

428
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:51,479
but she can't, of course. I come and go as I please.

429
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:53,517
The other mother hates cats?

430
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:56,679
Not like any mother I've ever known.

431
00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:59,087
What do you mean? She's amazing.

432
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:05,023
You probably think this world is a dream come true, but you're wrong.

433
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,394
The other Wybie told me so.

434
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:09,626
That's nonsense. He can't talk.

435
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:11,794
Perhaps not to you.

436
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:16,239
We cats, however, have far superior senses than humans,

437
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:18,673
and can see and smell and...

438
00:46:19,344 --> 00:46:20,402
Shh!

439
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:24,938
I hear something. Right over...

440
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,355
Hey, Wybie.

441
00:47:21,573 --> 00:47:23,598
She's practically naked!

442
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:27,634
I'm known as the siren of all seven seas

443
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:31,443
The breaker of hearts by the bay

444
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:35,509
So if you go swimming With bowlegged women

445
00:47:35,587 --> 00:47:39,751
I might steal your weak heart away

446
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:53,801
Oh, my God.

447
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:57,899
A big-bottomed sea witch May bob through the waves

448
00:47:57,976 --> 00:48:01,537
And hope to lead sailors astray

449
00:48:01,613 --> 00:48:07,176
But a true ocean goddess Must fill out her bodice

450
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:12,417
To present an alluring display

451
00:48:17,629 --> 00:48:22,157
Oh! Beware of old oysters too large in the chest

452
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:25,999
Let's banish them from the buffet

453
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,061
I'm far more nutritious

454
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:30,300
You smell like the fishes

455
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:32,502
Did I hear a banshee?

456
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:34,909
You're sea green with envy

457
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:37,140
This mermaid enchantress

458
00:48:37,215 --> 00:48:40,707
No, I, Birth of Venus

459
00:48:40,785 --> 00:48:43,618
- Will send sailors swooning... - Will send sailors swooning all day

460
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:14,809
I can't look.

461
00:49:14,886 --> 00:49:18,447
Ready to break a leg, Miriam?

462
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:21,822
Our lives for the theater, April.

463
00:49:41,546 --> 00:49:47,178
OTHER FORCIBLE: " What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason!"

464
00:49:47,252 --> 00:49:49,379
OTHER SPINK: "How infinite in faculty."

465
00:49:49,454 --> 00:49:53,857
"In form, in moving how express and admirable!"

466
00:49:53,925 --> 00:49:56,655
OTHER FORCIBLE: "In action like an angel."

467
00:49:57,829 --> 00:50:01,595
OTHER SPINK: " In apprehension how like a god!"

468
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:06,664
OTHER FORCIBLE: "The beauty of the world!"

469
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:11,839
OTHER SPINK: "The paragon of animals!"

470
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:17,071
Yeah!

471
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:53,008
Hey, there.

472
00:50:53,084 --> 00:50:54,813
Was it wonderful, dear?

473
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:58,083
Oh, yeah. They swooped down and pulled me right out of my seat,

474
00:50:58,156 --> 00:51:00,522
Spink and Forcible, only they weren't old ladies.

475
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:05,221
That was just a disguise. But then, I was flying through the air, and it was...

476
00:51:05,296 --> 00:51:06,820
It was magic.

477
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:09,093
You do like it here, don't you, Coraline?

478
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:10,600
Uh-huh.

479
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:12,329
Good night, Wybie.

480
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,740
You could stay here forever if you want to.

481
00:51:26,217 --> 00:51:27,809
- Really? - Sure.

482
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:31,616
We'll sing and play games, and Mother will cook your favorite meals.

483
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:34,249
There's one tiny little thing we need to do.

484
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:37,055
- What's that? - (CHUCKLING) Well, it's a surprise.

485
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:43,594
For you, our little doll.

486
00:51:49,474 --> 00:51:51,305
Black is traditional.

487
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:57,877
But if you'd prefer pink or vermillion or chartreuse...

488
00:51:59,517 --> 00:52:01,451
Though you might make me jealous.

489
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:04,647
No way! You're not sewing buttons in my eyes!

490
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:07,850
But we need a "yes" if you want to stay here.

491
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:09,722
So sharp you won't feel a...

492
00:52:12,063 --> 00:52:15,726
There, now. It's your decision, darling.

493
00:52:16,868 --> 00:52:19,063
We only want what's best for you.

494
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:21,503
I'm going to bed. Right now!

495
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:23,665
- Bed? - Before dinner?

496
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:26,301
I'm really, really tired. Yeah.

497
00:52:27,512 --> 00:52:30,538
I just need to sleep on things.

498
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:33,641
Well, of course you do, darling. I'll be happy to tuck you in.

499
00:52:33,718 --> 00:52:36,482
Oh, no, thanks. You've done so much already.

500
00:52:36,554 --> 00:52:39,580
You're welcome. And I...

501
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:43,950
We aren't worried at all, darling.

502
00:52:44,028 --> 00:52:47,293
Soon you'll see things our way.

503
00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:08,014
DRAGONFLIES: What's wrong, Coraline? Don't you wanna play?

504
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:11,653
Yeah! I wanna hug your face!

505
00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:13,921
GIRAFFE DOLL: Get a grip, soldier!

506
00:53:13,991 --> 00:53:15,219
GIRL. ; Hey! BO Y. ; Hey!

507
00:53:15,293 --> 00:53:17,454
Where's your buttons, Loper?

508
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,587
You want to stay, don't you?

509
00:53:19,664 --> 00:53:24,397
Going home tonight, robots, and I won't be back.

510
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:33,138
Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

511
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:34,200
(ECHOING) Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

512
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:35,711
O THER MO THER. ; ...a tiny little thing we need to do.

513
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,111
CORALINE. ; Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

514
00:53:37,181 --> 00:53:38,944
O THER FATHER. ; So sharp you won't feel a thing.

515
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:40,574
CORALINE. ; Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

516
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:42,744
O THER MO THER. ; Soon you'll see things our way.

517
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:52,893
Mom! Dad!

518
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:57,762
Oh, God. I'm still here?

519
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:15,850
Hey, you!

520
00:54:16,687 --> 00:54:19,485
Where's the other mother? I wanna go home.

521
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:23,618
All will be swell, soon as Mother's refreshed.

522
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:25,924
Her strength is our strength.

523
00:54:30,468 --> 00:54:32,902
Mustn't talk when Mother's not here.

524
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:36,098
If you won't even talk to me, I'm gonna find the other Wybie.

525
00:54:36,174 --> 00:54:38,074
- He'll help me. - No point.

526
00:54:38,142 --> 00:54:42,579
He pulled a long face, and Mother didn't like it.

527
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:10,167
And what do you think you're doing?

528
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:14,668
Well, I'm getting out of here. That's what I'm doing.

529
00:55:16,347 --> 00:55:17,473
Huh?

530
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:20,915
Something's wrong. Shouldn't the old well be here?

531
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:22,976
Nothing out here.

532
00:55:23,054 --> 00:55:25,488
It's the empty part of this world.

533
00:55:25,556 --> 00:55:28,889
She only made what she knew would impress you.

534
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,861
But why? Why does she want me?

535
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:35,299
She wants something to love, I think.

536
00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:37,834
Something that isn't her.

537
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:42,532
Or maybe she'd just love something to eat.

538
00:55:42,873 --> 00:55:46,832
Eat? That's ridiculous. Mothers don't eat daughters.

539
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:49,939
I don't know. How do you taste?

540
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:58,410
CORALINE: Huh?

541
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:04,193
But how can you walk away from something and still come back to it?

542
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:08,188
Walk around the world.

543
00:56:08,266 --> 00:56:09,494
Small world.

544
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:12,029
Hang on.

545
00:56:16,641 --> 00:56:19,132
Stop! He's one of the circus mice!

546
00:56:28,486 --> 00:56:31,353
I don't like rats at the best of times,

547
00:56:31,422 --> 00:56:34,357
but this one was sounding an alarm.

548
00:56:37,295 --> 00:56:38,660
Good kitty.

549
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:20,626
They say even the proudest spirit can be broken with love.

550
00:57:25,476 --> 00:57:29,378
Of course, chocolate never hurts. Like one?

551
00:57:30,715 --> 00:57:34,173
They're cocoa beetles from Zanzibar.

552
00:57:37,722 --> 00:57:42,523
I want to be with my real mom and dad.

553
00:57:42,927 --> 00:57:45,191
I want you to let me go.

554
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:49,331
Is that any way to talk to your mother?

555
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,960
You aren't my mother.

556
00:57:52,036 --> 00:57:56,200
Apologize at once, Coraline!

557
00:57:57,174 --> 00:57:58,198
No!

558
00:57:59,543 --> 00:58:02,307
I'll give you to the count of three.

559
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:05,476
One.

560
00:58:06,751 --> 00:58:08,218
Two.

561
00:58:10,721 --> 00:58:11,710
Three!

562
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:16,620
What are you doing? Ow! That hurts!

563
00:58:20,064 --> 00:58:23,864
You may come out when you've learned to be a loving daughter.

564
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,413
Who's there?

565
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:43,112
TALL GIRL GHOST: Hush! And shush. For the beldam might be listening.

566
00:58:44,622 --> 00:58:47,682
You... You mean the other mother?

567
00:58:59,103 --> 00:59:00,502
Who are you?

568
00:59:01,806 --> 00:59:04,604
Don't remember our names,

569
00:59:04,675 --> 00:59:07,803
but I 'member my true mommy.

570
00:59:09,346 --> 00:59:11,337
Why are you all here?

571
00:59:11,415 --> 00:59:12,939
GHOST CHILDREN: The beldam.

572
00:59:14,018 --> 00:59:18,853
She spied on our lives through the little doll's eyes.

573
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:22,483
BOY GHOST: And saw that we weren't happy.

574
00:59:23,127 --> 00:59:26,255
TALL GIRL GHOST: So she lured us away with treasures.

575
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:29,299
- And treats. - SWEET GIRL GHOST: And games to play.

576
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:31,630
BOY GHOST: Gave all that we asked.

577
00:59:31,702 --> 00:59:34,136
SWEET GIRL GHOST: Yet we still wanted more.

578
00:59:34,872 --> 00:59:38,035
TALL GIRL GHOST: So we let her sew the buttons.

579
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:43,877
BOY GHOST: She said that she loved us.

580
00:59:44,281 --> 00:59:46,476
TALL GIRL GHOST: But she locked us here.

581
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:49,883
GHOST CHILDREN: And ate up our lives.

582
00:59:52,957 --> 00:59:56,950
Well, she can't keep me in the dark forever.

583
00:59:57,795 --> 01:00:00,195
Not if she wants to win my life.

584
01:00:01,665 --> 01:00:04,498
Beating her is my only chance.

585
01:00:05,336 --> 01:00:08,328
Perhaps, if you do win your escape,

586
01:00:08,405 --> 01:00:10,464
you could find our eyes.

587
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:12,838
Has she taken those, too?

588
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:15,640
Yes, miss. And hidden them.

589
01:00:15,713 --> 01:00:19,240
BOY GHOST: Find our eyes, mistress, and our souls will be freed.

590
01:00:21,352 --> 01:00:22,546
I...

591
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,982
I'll try.

592
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:32,922
Wybie?

593
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:38,066
Did she do this to you?

594
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:46,275
- I hope that feels... - Shh!

595
01:00:53,284 --> 01:00:55,616
OTHER MOTHER: Coraline? Is that you?

596
01:00:55,686 --> 01:00:56,948
Let's go!

597
01:01:00,491 --> 01:01:01,753
OTHER MOTHER: Coraline!

598
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:05,959
Come on! She'll hurt you again.

599
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:15,236
OTHER MOTHER: Coraline! How dare you disobey your mother!

600
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:20,374
OTHER MOTHER: Coraline!

601
01:01:35,259 --> 01:01:37,454
I'm home!

602
01:01:40,564 --> 01:01:42,031
Anybody here?

603
01:01:44,435 --> 01:01:46,403
Hello? Hello, hello!

604
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:48,728
Real Dad?

605
01:01:50,074 --> 01:01:51,405
Real Mom?

606
01:01:52,109 --> 01:01:54,134
Oh, Mom's groceries!

607
01:01:58,315 --> 01:01:59,714
That's disgusting.

608
01:02:02,486 --> 01:02:05,319
I missed you guys so much, you'll never...

609
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:09,617
- Oh. The Wybie that talks. - Huh?

610
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:15,632
Yeah, so, you know that old doll I gave you?

611
01:02:15,933 --> 01:02:17,059
Um...

612
01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:20,501
My grandma's real mad. Says it was her sister's.

613
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:24,132
- The one that disappeared. - You stole that doll, didn't you?

614
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:26,938
Well, it looked just like you, and I figured...

615
01:02:27,011 --> 01:02:31,141
It used to look like this pioneer girl, then Huck Finn Jr.,

616
01:02:27,011 --> 01:02:31,141
It used to look like this pioneer girl, then Huck Finn Jr.,

617
01:02:31,215 --> 01:02:35,618
then it was this Little Rascals chick with all these ribbons and braids and...

618
01:02:35,686 --> 01:02:40,055
Grandma's missing sister. I think I just met her. Come on.

619
01:02:41,492 --> 01:02:43,619
(STAMMERING) Listen, I'm really not supposed to...

620
01:02:43,694 --> 01:02:44,752
Whoa!

621
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:50,857
She's in there.

622
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:55,469
Can you... Can you unlock it?

623
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:58,406
Not in a million years. But it wouldn't matter.

624
01:02:58,475 --> 01:03:02,138
She can't escape without her eyes. None of the ghosts can.

625
01:03:03,847 --> 01:03:07,339
Yeah. So I really need to get that doll.

626
01:03:07,685 --> 01:03:10,085
Great! I'd love to get rid of it.

627
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:14,284
Where are you hiding, you little monster?

628
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:17,521
- You and Grandma been talking? - The doll's her spy.

629
01:03:17,594 --> 01:03:20,995
It's how she watches you, finds out what's wrong with your life.

630
01:03:21,065 --> 01:03:25,001
- The doll is my grandma's spy? - No. The other mother.

631
01:03:25,069 --> 01:03:27,697
She's got this whole world where everything's better.

632
01:03:27,771 --> 01:03:32,799
The food, the garden, the neighbors. But it's all a trap.

633
01:03:34,611 --> 01:03:37,910
Yeah, I think I heard someone calling me, Jonesy.

634
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:40,882
Don't believe me? You can ask the cat.

635
01:03:40,951 --> 01:03:45,650
The cat? I'll just tell Grandma that you couldn't find the doll. Ow!

636
01:03:45,723 --> 01:03:47,623
You're not listening to me!

637
01:03:47,691 --> 01:03:50,524
That's 'Cause you're crazy!

638
01:03:56,133 --> 01:03:58,465
- CORALINE: You creep! - Crazy!

639
01:03:58,535 --> 01:04:02,403
Crazy? You're the jerk wad that gave me the doll!

640
01:04:03,807 --> 01:04:05,172
Mom! Dad!

641
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:15,407
Pick it up, Dad. Pick it up.

642
01:04:17,721 --> 01:04:18,779
Dad! Where...

643
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:20,881
DAD ON ANSWERING MACHINE. ; Hi! I'm digging in my garden right now,

644
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:23,927
but leave a message and I'll get right back to you.

645
01:04:23,994 --> 01:04:25,859
Where have you gone?

646
01:04:33,704 --> 01:04:36,867
Uh... Don't you only make wings for the dead ones?

647
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:38,908
Just looking ahead, dear.

648
01:04:38,976 --> 01:04:41,536
Angus hasn't been feeling very well of late.

649
01:04:41,612 --> 01:04:43,773
FORCIBLE: April? Aren't you getting ready?

650
01:04:43,847 --> 01:04:46,008
We've lost our ride, Miriam.

651
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:49,575
Caroline says her parents have vanished quite completely.

652
01:04:49,653 --> 01:04:53,316
What? We've waited months for those tickets.

653
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,358
I suppose we could walk.

654
01:04:55,425 --> 01:05:00,226
With your gammy legs? It's nearly two miles to the theater.

655
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:06,664
Oh, yes. Your missing parents.

656
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:10,031
We know just what you need.

657
01:05:10,107 --> 01:05:12,598
Miriam, get... That's right.

658
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:17,509
How is 100-year-old candy gonna help?

659
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:33,326
There you go, sweetie.

660
01:05:34,898 --> 01:05:37,458
- What's it for? - Well, it might help.

661
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:39,832
They're good for bad things sometimes.

662
01:05:39,903 --> 01:05:42,929
(CHUCKLING) No. They're good for lost things.

663
01:05:43,006 --> 01:05:45,167
SPINK: It's bad things, Miriam.

664
01:05:45,242 --> 01:05:47,676
- FORCIBLE: Lost things, April. - Bad.

665
01:05:47,744 --> 01:05:49,541
- FORCIBLE: Lost. - (WHISPERS) Bad things.

666
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:52,939
- Lost. - Bad.

667
01:05:53,016 --> 01:05:54,142
FORCIBLE: Lost!

668
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:23,404
Good night, Mom.

669
01:06:24,348 --> 01:06:25,940
Good night, Dad.

670
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,477
CORALINE: Hello. How did you get in?

671
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:02,485
Do you know where Mom and Dad are?

672
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:17,359
Mom? Dad!

673
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:24,200
Help us

674
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:39,385
How did this happen?

675
01:07:50,801 --> 01:07:52,428
She's taken them.

676
01:08:31,742 --> 01:08:35,075
They're not coming back, are they? Mom and Dad.

677
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:37,840
Not on their own.

678
01:08:39,883 --> 01:08:41,680
Only one thing to do.

679
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:17,116
You know, you're walking right into her trap.

680
01:09:17,888 --> 01:09:19,685
I have to go back.

681
01:09:20,857 --> 01:09:22,688
They are my parents.

682
01:09:24,461 --> 01:09:29,524
Challenge her, then. She may not play fair, but she won't refuse.

683
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:32,124
She's got a thing for games.

684
01:09:32,803 --> 01:09:34,031
Hmm.

685
01:09:34,538 --> 01:09:35,869
Okay.

686
01:09:39,876 --> 01:09:41,935
- OTHER MOTHER: Coraline? - Mom?

687
01:09:42,446 --> 01:09:45,210
Coraline! You came back for us.

688
01:09:45,282 --> 01:09:46,442
Mom!

689
01:09:49,586 --> 01:09:52,919
Darling, why would you run away from me?

690
01:09:58,795 --> 01:10:00,262
Where are my parents?

691
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:04,357
Gosh, I have no idea where your old parents are.

692
01:10:04,434 --> 01:10:07,426
Perhaps they've grown bored of you and run away to France.

693
01:10:07,504 --> 01:10:09,904
They weren't bored of me. You stole them!

694
01:10:09,973 --> 01:10:12,908
Now, don't be difficult, Coraline.

695
01:10:12,976 --> 01:10:15,001
Have a seat, won't you?

696
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:38,634
- Why don't you have your own key? - (GARBLED) Only one key.

697
01:10:38,702 --> 01:10:39,862
Shh!

698
01:10:39,936 --> 01:10:43,497
The garden squash need tending, don't you think, pumpkin?

699
01:10:43,807 --> 01:10:47,971
(GARBLED) Squish-squash, pumpkin sauce.

700
01:10:51,515 --> 01:10:52,743
Mom?

701
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:54,810
Dad?

702
01:10:56,486 --> 01:10:57,544
Where'd she hide you?

703
01:10:58,889 --> 01:11:00,413
OTHER MOTHER: Breakfast time!

704
01:11:06,463 --> 01:11:08,397
CORALINE. ; Be strong, Coraline.

705
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:25,775
Why don't we play a game?

706
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:30,108
- I know you like them. - Everybody likes games.

707
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:34,081
OTHER MOTHER: What kind of game would it be?

708
01:11:34,157 --> 01:11:37,490
An exploring game. A finding things game.

709
01:11:38,395 --> 01:11:41,421
And what is it you'd be finding, Coraline?

710
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:43,490
My real parents.

711
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:45,364
Too easy.

712
01:11:45,435 --> 01:11:48,097
And the eyes of the ghost children.

713
01:11:51,074 --> 01:11:53,406
What if you don't find them?

714
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:57,435
If I lose, I'll stay here with you forever and let you love me.

715
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:02,550
And I'll let you sew buttons into my eyes.

716
01:12:04,154 --> 01:12:07,715
And if you somehow win this game?

717
01:12:07,791 --> 01:12:10,385
Then you let me go. You let everyone go.

718
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:12,052
My real father and mother,

719
01:12:12,128 --> 01:12:14,858
the dead children, everyone you've trapped here.

720
01:12:16,433 --> 01:12:17,695
Deal.

721
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,628
Not till you give me a clue.

722
01:12:21,271 --> 01:12:23,034
Oh, right.

723
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,708
In each of three wonders I've made just for you,

724
01:12:27,777 --> 01:12:31,213
a ghost's eye is lost in plain sight.

725
01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:34,678
And for my parents?

726
01:12:38,488 --> 01:12:40,319
Fine. Don't tell me.

727
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:45,126
It's a deal.

728
01:12:53,303 --> 01:12:56,397
What does she mean, "wonders?"

729
01:13:35,211 --> 01:13:36,439
No!

730
01:13:56,866 --> 01:13:58,629
(GASPS) Stop!

731
01:14:15,919 --> 01:14:17,682
Why steal this?

732
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:21,950
Wow!

733
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:31,558
That must be it!

734
01:14:35,872 --> 01:14:37,703
(GARBLED) Sorry.

735
01:14:39,075 --> 01:14:43,739
So sorry. Mother making me.

736
01:14:44,614 --> 01:14:48,414
Don't wanna hurt you!

737
01:14:56,326 --> 01:14:58,385
Take it!

738
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:14,268
Bless you, miss. You found me!

739
01:15:14,544 --> 01:15:17,012
But there's two eyes still lost.

740
01:15:18,448 --> 01:15:21,349
Don't worry. I'm getting the hang of it.

741
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:48,027
The pearl.

742
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,032
- Thief! - Thief!

743
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:54,099
- Give it back! - Give it back!

744
01:16:54,177 --> 01:16:55,303
- Thief! - Thief!

745
01:16:55,378 --> 01:16:56,606
OTHER SPINK: Give it back!

746
01:16:56,679 --> 01:16:59,307
- Thief! - Thief!

747
01:16:59,382 --> 01:17:00,747
- Give it back! - Thief!

748
01:17:00,817 --> 01:17:02,375
- Thief! - Give it back!

749
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:03,510
- Give it back! - Thief!

750
01:17:03,586 --> 01:17:05,417
- Give it back! - Give it back!

751
01:17:05,488 --> 01:17:06,648
Thief!

752
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,417
- Thief! - Thief!

753
01:17:09,492 --> 01:17:11,960
Stop! Stop! Thief! Thief!

754
01:17:12,028 --> 01:17:13,586
OTHER FORCIBLE: Thief! Stop!

755
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:24,766
Hurry on, girl. Her web is unwinding.

756
01:17:41,224 --> 01:17:42,885
Oh, Wybie.

757
01:17:43,726 --> 01:17:47,628
Evil witch! I'm not scared!

758
01:18:04,547 --> 01:18:08,244
Hello, galoobooshka.

759
01:18:08,318 --> 01:18:09,876
I'm Coraline.

760
01:18:11,087 --> 01:18:15,080
Is this what you're looking for?

761
01:18:18,294 --> 01:18:21,821
You think winning game is good thing?

762
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:29,600
You'll just go home and be bored and neglected,

763
01:18:29,672 --> 01:18:35,372
same as always. Stay here with us.

764
01:18:35,845 --> 01:18:40,509
We will listen to you and laugh with you.

765
01:18:49,158 --> 01:18:54,790
If you stay here, you can have whatever you want.

766
01:18:56,132 --> 01:18:57,724
Always!

767
01:18:58,568 --> 01:19:00,536
You don't get it, do you?

768
01:19:00,603 --> 01:19:03,163
I don't understand.

769
01:19:03,806 --> 01:19:05,774
Of course you don't understand.

770
01:19:05,842 --> 01:19:08,367
You're just a copy she made of the real Mr. B.

771
01:19:08,444 --> 01:19:12,938
(DISTORTED) Not even that anymore.

772
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:28,756
No!

773
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,332
No!

774
01:19:44,614 --> 01:19:46,479
No!

775
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:12,998
Oh, God. I've lost the game. I've lost everything.

776
01:20:23,419 --> 01:20:27,753
I think I mentioned that I don't like rats at the best of times.

777
01:20:29,559 --> 01:20:32,551
I think you might have said something like that.

778
01:20:32,628 --> 01:20:35,529
It looked like you needed this one, however.

779
01:20:36,933 --> 01:20:38,264
Thank you.

780
01:20:43,706 --> 01:20:47,301
I'm heading inside. I still have to find my parents.

781
01:21:12,835 --> 01:21:14,666
Come on, quickly!

782
01:21:57,947 --> 01:22:00,916
So you're back.

783
01:22:01,884 --> 01:22:04,318
And you brought vermin with you.

784
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:07,681
No. I...

785
01:22:09,225 --> 01:22:10,988
I brought a friend.

786
01:22:11,661 --> 01:22:14,926
You know I love you.

787
01:22:19,368 --> 01:22:22,929
You have a very funny way of showing it.

788
01:22:24,574 --> 01:22:28,977
So where are they? The ghost eyes?

789
01:22:34,417 --> 01:22:39,320
Hold on. We aren't finished yet. Are we?

790
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:41,720
No, I suppose not.

791
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:47,752
After all, you still need to find your old parents, don't you?

792
01:22:49,065 --> 01:22:52,626
Too bad you won't have this.

793
01:23:03,412 --> 01:23:07,610
Be clever, miss. Even if you win, she'll never let you go!

794
01:23:16,092 --> 01:23:18,856
I already know where you've hidden them.

795
01:23:20,596 --> 01:23:23,224
Well, produce them.

796
01:23:25,067 --> 01:23:27,228
They're behind that door.

797
01:23:27,303 --> 01:23:30,170
Oh, they are, are they?

798
01:23:41,217 --> 01:23:42,411
(WHISPERS) There.

799
01:23:45,254 --> 01:23:47,017
Mom. Dad.

800
01:23:52,061 --> 01:23:56,521
Go on. Open it. They'll be there, all right.

801
01:23:58,334 --> 01:24:03,397
You're wrong, Coraline. They aren't there.

802
01:24:05,508 --> 01:24:10,605
Now you're going to stay here forever.

803
01:24:11,447 --> 01:24:14,644
No, I'm not!

804
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:28,689
OTHER MOTHER: No!

805
01:24:31,734 --> 01:24:34,259
You horrible cheating girl!

806
01:24:52,755 --> 01:24:56,691
No! Where are you?

807
01:24:56,759 --> 01:24:58,920
You selfish brat!

808
01:25:16,345 --> 01:25:19,143
You dare disobey your mother?

809
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:26,781
Please shut it!

810
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:46,066
OTHER MOTHER: Don't leave me! Don't leave me!

811
01:25:46,142 --> 01:25:48,940
I'll die without you!

812
01:26:20,109 --> 01:26:21,542
MOM: Coraline, we're home.

813
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:23,840
Mom! Dad! I missed you so much!

814
01:26:25,014 --> 01:26:29,144
Missed us? Oh, no. You broke my favorite snow globe.

815
01:26:29,218 --> 01:26:32,051
I didn't break it. It must've broke when you escaped.

816
01:26:32,121 --> 01:26:33,247
And cut your knee.

817
01:26:33,322 --> 01:26:35,950
Coraline, I asked you to count all the windows,

818
01:26:36,025 --> 01:26:37,686
not put your knee through them.

819
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:40,228
- But... - Well, get yourself cleaned up.

820
01:26:40,296 --> 01:26:44,255
- We're going out tonight. - (EXCLAIMS) We got a lot to celebrate.

821
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:47,393
You're talking about your garden catalog?

822
01:26:47,937 --> 01:26:50,371
Of course. What else?

823
01:26:50,439 --> 01:26:53,033
CORALINE: But look at the snow on your...

824
01:26:53,109 --> 01:26:55,509
What's gotten into you, Coraline?

825
01:27:10,926 --> 01:27:13,588
- So, gonna order the tulips? - What's that?

826
01:27:13,662 --> 01:27:15,254
For the garden party?

827
01:27:15,331 --> 01:27:17,856
I have no idea what you're talking about.

828
01:27:17,933 --> 01:27:21,801
Dad! So, Ma, invitations?

829
01:27:21,871 --> 01:27:24,806
- Don't forget the invitations. - Even Bobinsky?

830
01:27:24,874 --> 01:27:29,368
Mr. B.'s not drunk, Mom. He's just eccentric.

831
01:27:31,213 --> 01:27:33,044
Good night, Coraline.

832
01:27:52,535 --> 01:27:53,866
Oh.

833
01:27:54,403 --> 01:27:55,836
Hello again.

834
01:27:56,705 --> 01:27:58,195
You still mad?

835
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:03,243
I'm really sorry I threw you at her, the other mother.

836
01:28:04,446 --> 01:28:06,676
It was all I could think of.

837
01:28:20,696 --> 01:28:23,324
I think it's time, don't you?

838
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,895
To set them free?

839
01:28:48,791 --> 01:28:51,817
It's a fine, fine thing you did for us, miss.

840
01:28:52,461 --> 01:28:55,362
Well, I'm glad it's finally over.

841
01:28:56,932 --> 01:29:00,368
It is over and done with for us.

842
01:29:00,869 --> 01:29:02,359
What about me?

843
01:29:02,438 --> 01:29:04,565
You're in terrible danger, girl!

844
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:07,234
But how? I locked the door!

845
01:29:07,309 --> 01:29:11,973
It's the key, miss. There's only one, and the beldam will find it.

846
01:29:13,082 --> 01:29:15,243
'Tain't all bad, miss.

847
01:29:15,918 --> 01:29:20,548
Thou art alive. Thou art still living.

848
01:29:31,533 --> 01:29:35,162
I gotta hide this somewhere, somewhere she can never...

849
01:29:42,978 --> 01:29:44,468
Out of my way!

850
01:29:59,795 --> 01:30:03,231
CORALINE: (SINGING) Oh, my twitchy-witchy girl

851
01:30:03,299 --> 01:30:05,233
I think you are so nice

852
01:30:05,301 --> 01:30:10,568
I give you bowls of porridge and I give you bowls of ice cream

853
01:30:12,207 --> 01:30:14,767
I give you lots of kisses

854
01:30:16,345 --> 01:30:18,472
And I give you lots of hugs

855
01:30:19,448 --> 01:30:21,678
But I never give you sandwiches

856
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:26,681
With grease and worms and mung...beans

857
01:31:58,147 --> 01:32:03,414
I'm really sorry I didn't believe you about all this evil stuff, Coraline.

858
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:07,045
Why did you change your mind?

859
01:32:07,122 --> 01:32:11,024
Well, Grandma showed me this picture after I called you crazy.

860
01:32:12,327 --> 01:32:15,558
It's her and her sister, before she disappeared.

861
01:32:15,631 --> 01:32:17,496
The Sweet Ghost Girl.

862
01:32:17,566 --> 01:32:21,502
LOVAT: Wyborne! Come home!

863
01:32:22,371 --> 01:32:25,272
Oh, man. What am I gonna tell her?

864
01:32:26,108 --> 01:32:30,169
Just bring her by the house tomorrow. We can tell her together.

865
01:32:30,879 --> 01:32:33,279
We... We can?

866
01:32:33,348 --> 01:32:36,317
You know, I'm glad you decided to stalk me.

867
01:32:38,821 --> 01:32:39,913
It wasn't my idea.

868
01:33:06,281 --> 01:33:09,182
CORALINE: Thanks for helping me, Miss Spink, Miss Forcible.

869
01:33:09,251 --> 01:33:12,687
Oh, look, April. Pink ladies!

870
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:16,212
Actually, it's just lemonade. How's Angus doing?

871
01:33:16,291 --> 01:33:21,319
Oh, much better, dear, but he can't duck his wings forever.

872
01:33:21,396 --> 01:33:22,420
DAD: Here comes a burp.

873
01:33:23,565 --> 01:33:24,589
MOM: Charlie!

874
01:33:24,666 --> 01:33:28,397
Excusez-moi, but that pizza, that was delicious.

875
01:33:29,404 --> 01:33:31,634
- CORALINE: Cold drinks? - Oh, yeah. Great.

876
01:33:31,707 --> 01:33:35,234
You were right, Coraline. I really hate dirt!

877
01:33:35,911 --> 01:33:38,709
But the tulips look nice.

878
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:40,509
CORALINE: Thanks, Mom.

879
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:47,152
That is possible.

880
01:33:49,858 --> 01:33:51,917
CORALINE: How are the mooshkas, Mr. B?

881
01:33:51,994 --> 01:33:55,327
They tell me that you are savior, Caroline.

882
01:33:55,397 --> 01:33:57,024
And soon as they are ready,

883
01:33:57,099 --> 01:34:00,500
they wish to give special thanks you performance.

884
01:34:00,569 --> 01:34:04,630
LOVAT: Wyborne, I know where I'm going.

885
01:34:04,706 --> 01:34:06,503
I grew up here.

886
01:34:06,575 --> 01:34:08,338
CORALINE: Welcome, Miss Lovat!

887
01:34:09,244 --> 01:34:11,235
Oh. Hello.

888
01:34:12,915 --> 01:34:16,510
I'm Coraline Jones. I've got so much to tell you.

889
01:34:16,585 --> 01:34:18,314
MOM: Here. DAD: Thanks.

890
01:34:18,987 --> 01:34:21,046
SPINK: Do you want to pop a little gin in it, dear?

891
01:34:21,123 --> 01:34:22,454
FORCIBLE: Of course.

892
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:35,300
pink palace apartments
