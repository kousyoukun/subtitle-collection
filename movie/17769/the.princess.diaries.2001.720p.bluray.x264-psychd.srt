00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,990
我不是什么公主
l'm no princess.

289
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,460
我还在等着正常的生长发育
I'm still waiting for normal body parts to arrive.

290
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,190
我拒绝搬家去统治一个国家...
I refuse to move to and rule a country...

291
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,930
而且...你想听另一个原因吗?
and...Do you want another reason?

292
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,630
我不想做公主!
I don't want to be a princess!

293
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,170
哦 Amelia...Amelia!
Oh, Amelia...Amelia!

294
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,830
Amelia 回来!
Amelia, come back here!

295
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,980
嗯 进展得多顺利啊 是吧?
Well, that went well, didn't it?

296
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,490
-也许她需要更多时间  -你愿意帮忙吗?
-Perhaps she needs more time.  -Will you help me?

297
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,550
Thermopolis小姐?
Miss Thermopolis?

298
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,560
我是你的安全总管...
I'm the head of your security...

299
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,290
你想让我去做司机和保姆
and you want me to be a chauffeur and baby-sitter.

300
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,630
现在看来 这个孩子需要保护
For the time being. The chiId needs protection.

301
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,830
十五年来...
For 15 years...

302
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,500
你就不能抽空...
you couldn't find a spare minute...

303
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,770
告诉我我爸是皇室成员?
to tell me that my father is a royal?

304
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,280
我原以为我这么做是对的
I thought I was doing the right thing.

305
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,010
对谁来说是对的 妈?
The right thing for who, Mom?

306
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,510
对我们都是对的
For all of us.

307
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,240
我是说 如果我们秘密地离了婚...
l mean, if we secretly divorced...

308
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,550
他就会再找一个妻子...
he would be able to find a woman...

309
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,250
能留在Genovia他的身边并给他生个子嗣...
who would stay by his side in Genovia and produce heirs...

310
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,190
我就可以自由地和你一起生活
and I would be free to live my life with you.

311
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,920
我是说 拜托! 我们在大学相识!
I mean, please! We met in college!

312
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,120
我还很年轻! 我想画画
I was young! I wanted to paint.

313
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,260
你能想象我在别人身后亦步亦趋地走...
Can you see me walking one step behind someone...

314
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,630
这样了此一生?
for the rest of my Iife?

315
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,290
遵从着繁文缛节...
With rules and regulations...

316
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,960
不停地挥手 鞠躬 刮擦?
and the waving and the bowing and the scraping?

317
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,470
我很害怕!
I was scared!

318
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,560
和一个...
Living with a mother...

319
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,200
欺骗了我15年的母亲生活在一起也让我很害怕
who lied to me for 15 years scares me.

320
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,710
你去哪儿?
Where are you going?

321
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,640
整理我的寝宫
To straighten up the royal bedchamber.

322
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,420
离婚之后 我们一起讨论过
After the divorce, we all discussed it.

323
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,180
你父亲和你奶奶...
Your father and your grandmother...

324
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,780
都同意和你保持距离...
both agreed to keep that distance...

325
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,120
这样你就能拥有一个正常的童年...
so you would have a chance of a normal childhood...

326
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,680
情感上不受干扰
free of emotional complications.

327
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,220
我们本想等你18岁的时候告诉你...
We were going to tell you when you were 18 years oId...

328
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,390
但是你父亲一死 事情就变了 Mia
but when your father died, things changed, Mia.

329
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,560
我们想保护你
We wanted to protect you.

330
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,900
好吧 你知道吗?
Ok.You know what?

331
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,810
我没觉得受到了保护
I don't feel protected.

332
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,940
你活了15年...
You try living for 15 years...

333
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,170
认为自己是某个人...
thinking that you're one person...

334
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,410
然后不到5分钟功夫你发现...
and then in five minutes you find out...

335
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,410
你是个公主

336
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,310
就是以防...
Just in case...

337
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,980
我还不够像个怪胎...
I'm not enough of a freak already...

338
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,320
还要给我戴上个皇冠!
let's add a tiara!

339
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,120
那好 把汤喝了
Well, drink your soup.

340
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,650
我不饿
I'm not really hungry.

341
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,160
好吧
Fine.

342
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,790
晚安 亲爱的
Good night, sweetheart.

343
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,830
肥Louie...

345
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,960
你不知道父母是谁
you don't know who your parents are.

346
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,540
我从没坐过豪华轿车...
I've never ridden in a limo...

347
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,380
他苦涩地承认...
he admitted bitterly to himseIf...

348
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,410
当他凭窗眺望...
as he crossed to the open window...

349
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,890
遥看海湾 薄雾迫近...
and looked out at the bay, the fog looming...

350
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,790
就像可怜的人生呈现在他面前
like his pathetic life before him.

351
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,590
难以置信我获得了艾美奖
I can't beIieve I won an Emmy.

352
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,530
我有自己最喜欢的Phillipe的照片
I have this favorite photo of Phillipe.

353
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,160
我们的大学时光很愉快

354
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,930
他充满了生活情趣...

355
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,900
总是兴高采烈的

356
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,230
我记得
I remember.

357
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:34,260
Helen 如果Amelia拒绝继承王位...
Helen, if Amelia refuses to accept the throne...

358
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,040
Genovia将不复存在 就像我们所知道的
then Genovia will cease to exist as we know it.

359
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,210
所以汝国的未来...
So the future of your country...

360
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,440
就掌握在我15岁女儿的手里?

361
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,950
在这儿

362
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,130
Phillipe准备好了做国王

却发生了可怕的意外
Then the terrible accident.

364
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,470
即使我们之间处的不好...
Even though it didn't work out between us...

365
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,340
我还是非常爱你的儿子

366
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,350
谢谢

367
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,210
嗯 就像往常一样...
Well, as always...

368
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,150
我还是得这个样子

369
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,190
我等不到她18岁了
I can't wait until she's 1 8.

370
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,590
哦 这是个噩梦
Oh, this is a nightmare.

371

Mia 我们三个得谈谈

373
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,260
哦 好吧 还有什么...
Oh, Ok. Is there something else...

374
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,330
关于我和我的生活的事也许是我想知道的?
about me and my life just maybe I might want to know about?

375
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,400
你们是不是想带我去个脱口秀节目...
Are you two waiting to take me on a talk show...

376
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,910
告诉我我有一个孪生姐妹是公爵夫人?

377
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,880
你有个表亲是伯爵夫人

叫做Bartholomew

实际上 我们叫他Pookie

昨天我们进行地并不顺利
Yesterday did not go well.

381
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,220
请你听你奶奶说好吗?

382
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,420
Amelia 几个星期之后...
Amelia, in a matter of weeks...

383
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,260
我们有个年度舞会

384
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:08,000
我本来...我希望借此机会能把你介绍给...
I was...I am hoping that I may present you...

385
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,090
媒体和公众

386
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,140
然而 你迫切需要一些指导
However, you desperately need some instruction.

387
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,940
我代表整个Genovian国会...

388
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,570
和皇室家族

389
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,600
我代表这个家
And I speak for this family.

390
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,910
对不起...
Excuse me...

391
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,470
我没有你们这样的家庭...
I don't have a family with either one of you...

392
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,150
因为你15年来无视我的存在...
because you ignored me for 15 years...

393
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,590
你骗我
and you lied to me.

394
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,280
家人不做这样的事 对吧?
Families don't do stuff like that, Ok?

395
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,620
她去哪儿?
Where is she going?

396
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,130
塔楼
The tower.

397
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,760
Mia 你不能逃避一切!
Mia, you can't run from everything!

398
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,460
她有个塔楼?

399
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,970
拜托? 从上面下来
Please? Just come down from there.

400
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,770
大多数孩子想要一辆车...
Most kids hope for a car...

401
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,170
来庆祝16岁生日 而不是个国家!
for their 16th birthday, not a country!

402
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,380
请别客气
Just make yourself comfortable.

403
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,210
这样解决不了问题!
This is getting us nowhere!

404
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,680
和我谈谈
Talk to me.

405
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,250
我现在不能和你谈
I can't talk to you right now.

406
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,310
我跟法律顾问的约谈要迟到了
I'm late for a meeting with my guidance counselor.

407
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,260
我跟西班牙和葡萄牙的会议也要迟到了
I'm late for a meeting with Spain and Portugal.

408
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,120
我有个想法
l have a thought.

409
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,130
Mia 保证在你的舞会之前...
Mia promises to attend princess lessons...

410
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,690
会参加公主训练课程
until your ball.

411
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,330
嗯 那不是我的舞会
Well, it's not my ball.

412
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,840
那是Genovia一年一度的国庆舞会
It's Genovia's annual Independence Day ball.

413
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,360
对不起
I'm sorry.

414
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,840
Mia 保证既不接受也不拒绝...
Mia promises neither to accept nor reject...

415
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,510
你的皇室邀请 直到这个盛大舞会开始...
your offer to be royal untiI this grand ball...

416
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,670
到时候她再做决定
and then she makes her decision.

417
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,810
现在 你们都能接受吧?
Now, can you both live with that?

418
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,190
看起来我别无选择
It seems I have no option.

419
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,930
我也是
If I have to.

420
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,430
但是我希望舞会之前不透露出去一个字
But I want not one word of this until that evening.

421
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,470
够明白了?
Is that understood?

422
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,340
媒体会穷追不舍的
The press would have a field day.

423
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:56,810
那么 不要让西班牙和葡萄牙等着了
Well. Let's not keep Spain and Portugal waiting.

424
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,900
今天我就要16岁了...
I'll be 16 this year...

425
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,470
我妈卖掉了两幅画给我买了辆1966年产的野马跑车
and my mom traded two paintings for a 1966 Mustang.

426
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,010
你知道野马是什么吧?

对公主来说那种车不合适

但是你不会想见他

Joseph 我们能把那些旗子放下来吗? 拜托?
Joseph, can we eighty-six the flags? Please?

452

Charlotte, take notes, will you?

567
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,130
Amelia 慢慢地转个身...
Amelia, circle slowly...

568
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:04,300
好让我看看要做些什么
so I can evaluate the work to be done.

569
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,770
Amelia!
Amelia!

570
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,540
你恶劣的姿势影响到你的听力了吗?
Does your bad posture affect your hearing?

571
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,480
-转过来  -哦 对不起
-Turn.  -Oh, sorry.

572
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,070
不 不 不 慢慢地转
No, no, no. Slowly, turn.

573
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,050
慢一点 谢谢
Slowly. Thank you.

574
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,180
嗯 姿态 很明显 发型
Well, carriage, obviously. Hairstyle.

575
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,980
气色...
Complexion...

576
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,820
停!
Stop!

577
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,850
眼睛...很可爱...
Eyes...lovely...

578
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:30,430
但是却被野人一样的眉毛遮盖住了
but hidden beneath bushman eyebrows.

579
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,970
脖子还行
The neck is seemly.

580
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,470
耳朵...
Ears...

581
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,130
像她的父亲
like her father.

582
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,830
真的吗? 像吗?
Really? They are?

583
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:44,210
哦 天哪! 谁的指甲是这个样子?
Oh, my! Who has nails like these?

584
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,580
大家都这样
Everybody.

585
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,580
明天我要见到干净的手指
Tomorrow I would like to see clean fingers.

586
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,380
你要穿上长袜
And you will wear stockings.

587
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,110
不要穿紧身裤或短袜
Not tights, not socks.

588
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,950
我也再不想见到这双鞋了
And I never want to see those shoes again.

589
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,180
走在人群中...
When walking in a crowd...

590
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,390
你会随时处在大家的审视中
one is under scrutiny all the time.

591
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,460
所以我们不能像这样弯腰驼背
So we don't shlump, like this.

592
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,330
我们肩膀放松...
We drop the shoulders...

593
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,270
我们高人一等...
we think tall...

594
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,000
我们微微前倾 把体重...
we tuck under and transfer the weight...

595
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,980
从一只脚转移到...
from one foot to...

596
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:23,140
不对 公主从不在公众场合叠着腿
No. Princesses never cross their legs in public.

597
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,210
为什么不把一个脚跟放在另一个后面...
Why don't you just tuck one ankle behind the other...

598
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,090
然后把双手优雅地放在膝盖上
and place the hands gracefully on the knees.

599
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,830
Charlotte 该到喝茶的时间了
Charlotte, I think it's time for tea.

600
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,390
告诉我 我妈是如何...
Tell me, how does my mother...

601
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,090
或者 说真的 任何人在那种情况下...
or, really, any person, for that matter...

602
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,660
参加一个家长会...
go into a parent-teacher conference...

603
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,200
最后却和老师约会?
and come out with a date?

604
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,870
Mia O'Connell先生还没结婚...
Mia, Mr. O'Connell is not married...

605
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,240
没和任何人同居...
he's not living with anyone...

606
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,110
而且他没有穿耳洞 没有纹身 没有植发
plus he's not pierced, tattooed, or hair-plugged.

607
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:59,180
你知道这种人在市场街南部是多么难找吗?
Do you realize how rare that is south of Market Street?

608
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,380
你知道会发生什么...
Did it ever occur to you...

609
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,390
如果你和我的老师约会...
that if you dated one of my teachers...

610
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,720
就会让其他同学...
it would give the other kids...

611
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,690
有机会嘲笑我一辈子?
license to mock me for the rest of my life?

612
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,930
没有 你是对的 我没想到 对不起
No, you're right. I didn't, and I'm sorry.

613
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,670
只是那个Patrick...
It's just that Patrick...

614
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,230
O'Connell先生...实在是个好人
Mr. O'Connell...is such a nice man.

615
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,860
他是个真正的绅士...
He's a real gentleman...

616
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:24,010
而且我很长很长时间都没遇到过这样的人了
and I haven't met one of those in a long, long time.

617
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,950
好吧 这...无所谓
Ok. It's...it's fine.

618
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,110
我做什么都不对 是吗?
I just can't do anything right anymore, can I?

619
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,150
加油! 进球!
Come on! Go for it!

620
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,160
-加油 躲过她!  -单刀直入!

621
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,380
哇 哇 哇!
Aah, aah, aah!

622
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,980

623
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,500
哪怕挡住一个 Mia!
Just block one, Mia!

624
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,220
我做不来 我是个女生
I can't do this. I'm a girl.

625
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,430

What am I, a duck?

626
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,430
不是! 我是说...你是运动型的

631
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,640
Josh! 过来
Josh! Get in here.

632
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,740

嗯 我刚才看见你练了...
So, I was watching you earlier...

634
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,680
你非常紧张
and you're way tense.

635
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,150
你明白我在说什么吧?
You know what I'm saying?

636

夏日的轻吻...
Soft kisses on a summer's day...

637

你应该像球一样思考 把自己变成球
You gotta think like the ball. Be the ball.

638
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,360
你应该挡住它 明白我的意思吧?
You gotta stop it, know what I mean?

639

-嘿 Joe?  -嗯?
-Hey, Joe?  -Mm-hmm?

642
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,970
我想把后座变成一个更衣室...
I'm turning the back seat into a dressing room...

643
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,440
这样我就能衣着得体地去见我奶奶
so I can change into a proper outfit for madame.

644
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,710

they asked if I wanted them wrapped...

649
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,880
还是直接穿
or if I wanted to wear them.

650
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,950

665
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:32,030
用Hermeez围巾拘禁客人的传统?
to imprison your dinner guests with Hermeez scarves?

666
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,800
那是Hermés牌(法国服装品牌 其围巾尤为著名)的
lt's Hermés.

667
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,540
围巾只是个训练工具
The scarf is merely a training tool.

668
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,040
最后你会学会没有它...
Eventually you will learn to sit...

669
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,810
也能恰当地就座和用餐

672
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,820
现在 Genovia和西班牙贸易往来很多...
Now, Genovia does a lot of trade with Spain...

673
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,090
所以我们要为此做好准备

我们有Genovian的舞蹈
We have a Genovian alternative.

683
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,810
好了 今天的舞蹈是很安静的...
Now, the dances here are very sedate...

684
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,510
以臀部为准 卡好位
right from the hips. In place.

685
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,810
头请别乱动
No bobbing of the head, please.

686
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,680
你不是车上的摇头狗

挺直了
Straight up.

688

Now, this dance is...

690
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,890
介于华尔兹和探戈之间的 看到了?
between a waltz and a tango, you see?

691
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:30,160
是华尔戈吗?
It's a wango?

692
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,690
不是
No.

693
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,260
好吧 来 转出去...
All right, here we go. Spin out...

694
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,300

再来一次 再转一次
Try again. One more spin.

698
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,440
快一点 现在转出去
Very quickly, now pull away.

699
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,640
就这样 很好
That's it. Good.

700
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,670
姿态不错 转回来
Good attitude. Spin in.

701
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,710
-好  -我做到了?
-Good.  -I did it?

702
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,620
奶奶 我没伤到人!
Grandma, I spun without hurting anyone!

703
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,420

就因为那些学生...

对国家和人民的爱

这是他做过的最困难的选择

01:15:53,077 --> 01:15:54,203
真的?
Really?

1545
01:15:54,245 --> 01:15:55,576
他们走了 对
They're gone. Yeah.

1546
01:15:55,613 --> 01:15:56,944
哦 太好了
Oh, good.

1547
01:16:00,218 --> 01:16:01,378
所以 我们去找一个...
So, what do you say we go find...

1548
01:16:01,419 --> 01:16:03,979
更浪漫的地方怎么样?
a more romantic spot?

1549
01:16:04,022 --> 01:16:05,319
好
OK.

1550
01:16:05,356 --> 01:16:07,620
安静! 安静!
Quiet! Quiet!

1551
01:16:17,602 --> 01:16:18,660
不! 别走!
No! Stay!

1552
01:16:19,904 --> 01:16:21,303
吻她!
Give her a smooch!

1553
01:16:21,339 --> 01:16:24,069
快点! 给她一个猛烈的潮湿的吻!
Come on! Give her a big, sloppy wet one!

1554
01:16:24,108 --> 01:16:25,234
保持住!
Hold it!

1555
01:16:26,744 --> 01:16:28,575
再打他一下!
Hit him again!

1556
01:16:28,613 --> 01:16:32,105
走开! 不 不 不! 走开 所有人!
Go away! No, no, no! Go away, all of you!

1557
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:34,209
公主离开了这所建筑
The princess has left the building.

1558
01:16:34,252 --> 01:16:35,344
我们手上的是谁?
Who have we got?

1559
01:16:35,386 --> 01:16:36,580
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

1560
01:16:36,621 --> 01:16:38,350
你上哪所学校?
Where do you go to school?

1561
01:16:38,389 --> 01:16:40,357
Josh Bryant
Josh Bryant.

1562
01:16:40,391 --> 01:16:42,689
我读Grove高中
I go to Grove High School.

1563
01:16:42,727 --> 01:16:44,524
我们现在是什么 Mia的朋友吗?
What are we, friends with Mia now?

1564
01:16:44,562 --> 01:16:46,587
对 我们恨Josh
Yes. We hate Josh.

1565
01:16:46,631 --> 01:16:49,065
对不起 很难记住我们不和谁好
Sorry. It's hard to keep up with who we're not talking to.

1566
01:16:49,133 --> 01:16:50,828
她来了!
Here she comes!

1567
01:16:50,902 --> 01:16:52,164
Mia!
Mia!

1568
01:16:52,236 --> 01:16:53,703
真的很抱歉 我不方便说话
I'm really sorry. I can't talk.

1569
01:16:53,738 --> 01:16:55,205
我得去拿我的衣服
I have to go get my clothes.

1570
01:16:55,273 --> 01:16:56,570
这样 在这儿 我们给你拿来了
Well, here. We've got your clothes.

1571
01:16:56,608 --> 01:16:57,734
你会暖和很多的
You'll be a lot warmer.

1572
01:16:57,775 --> 01:16:58,867
你们想帮我?
You guys want to help me?

1573
01:16:58,910 --> 01:17:01,504
对 Josh是个大白痴
Yeah. Josh is such an idiot.

1574
01:17:01,546 --> 01:17:03,070
我们保证没人打扰你
We'll make sure no one bothers you.

1575
01:17:03,114 --> 01:17:05,878
谢谢 呃...
Thank you. Um...

1576
01:17:05,917 --> 01:17:07,782
你们真是太好了
That's really nice of you.

1577
01:17:07,819 --> 01:17:08,945
你们真好
This is so great of you.

1578
01:17:08,987 --> 01:17:10,284
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

1579
01:17:14,359 --> 01:17:15,883
一切顺利
Everything's fine.

1580
01:17:15,927 --> 01:17:17,053
有人来吗?
Is anybody coming?

1581
01:17:17,095 --> 01:17:18,756
-没有!  -没有!
-No!  -No!

1582
01:17:18,796 --> 01:17:20,024
伙计 我真的很感激
Guys, I really appreciate this.

1583
01:17:20,064 --> 01:17:21,361
谢谢
Thank you.

1584
01:17:21,399 --> 01:17:23,697
她把泳衣脱掉了
She's got her bathing suit off.

1585
01:17:25,269 --> 01:17:27,066
好了 就是现在!
OK, now!

1586
01:17:27,105 --> 01:17:28,197
公主 嗨!
Princess, hi!

1587
01:17:29,641 --> 01:17:32,041
那是Mia公主的叫声
That was the scream of Princess Mia.

1588
01:17:32,076 --> 01:17:34,237
走开 你们 求你们了!
Go away, all of you, please!

1589
01:17:34,278 --> 01:17:36,473
没事 过来 Mia
OK. Come here, Mia.

1590
01:17:36,514 --> 01:17:40,109
你们这些食人鱼! 后退!
Piranhas, all of you! Back off!

1591
01:17:42,654 --> 01:17:45,919
我妈妈总是告诉我不能哭...
My mom always told me I couIdn't cry...

1592
01:17:45,957 --> 01:17:47,083
让我坚强...
and told me to be a big girl...

1593
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:50,117
但是你受到了伤害 所以哭吧
but you've been hurt, so you just cry.

1594
01:17:51,829 --> 01:17:55,265
太糟糕了
It was really bad.

1595
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:59,793
我的脚根本没有翘起来
My foot didn't even pop.

1596
01:17:59,871 --> 01:18:01,202
昨天晚上...
It was just last night...

1597
01:18:01,239 --> 01:18:03,173
旧金山的小公主...
that San Francisco's own little princess...

1598
01:18:03,207 --> 01:18:04,572
在海边参加聚会...
partied at the beach...

1599
01:18:04,609 --> 01:18:06,600
但是从一开始无伤大雅的娱乐...
but what started out as innocent fun...

1600
01:18:06,644 --> 01:18:10,341
据说很快变成了纵情狂欢
soon turned into allegedly too much fun.

1601
01:18:10,381 --> 01:18:13,475
以上是记者Suki Sanchez的报道
This is Suki Sanchez for KPFW.

1602
01:18:14,919 --> 01:18:16,648
请说点什么吧
Please say something.

1603
01:18:16,688 --> 01:18:18,588
嗯 没什么好说的
Well, there's not much to say.

1604
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:21,387
一张照片胜过千言万语...
A picture's worth a thousand words...

1605
01:18:21,426 --> 01:18:25,021
你被拍了两张
and you have two pictures.

1606
01:18:25,063 --> 01:18:27,861
我让家族蒙羞了 是吗?
I embarrassed the family, didn't I?

1607
01:18:27,899 --> 01:18:32,131
坦率地说 的确是
Not to put too fine a point on it, yes, you did.

1608
01:18:32,203 --> 01:18:34,467
我认为你决定...
I think you're making a wise decision...

1609
01:18:34,505 --> 01:18:36,530
放弃头衔是明智的
to abstain from the job.

1610
01:18:36,607 --> 01:18:40,839
我想我不用去参加舞会了
I suppose I won't come to the ball.

1611
01:18:40,878 --> 01:18:42,675
你当然应该去
Of course you should come.

1612
01:18:42,714 --> 01:18:43,840
你仍然是家族的一员
You're still family.

1613
01:18:43,881 --> 01:18:45,508
就因为你不想做我们的公主...
Just because you don't want to be our princess...

1614
01:18:45,550 --> 01:18:48,110
并不意味着我们就把你放逐了
doesn't mean we're sending you into exile.

1615
01:18:48,152 --> 01:18:49,551
你母亲准备要来
Your mother's planning to come.

1616
01:18:49,587 --> 01:18:51,487
邀请了你所有的客人
All your guests are invited.

1617
01:18:51,522 --> 01:18:53,649
除了沙滩上的那些
Except for your beach friends.

1618
01:18:53,691 --> 01:18:56,216
现在 失陪一下...
Now, if you'll excuse me...

1619
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:58,854
我要见一下媒体 控制一下灾情
I'm meeting with the press to do some damage control.

1620
01:19:07,772 --> 01:19:10,036
现在你可以进来了
You can come in now.

1621
01:19:14,178 --> 01:19:16,271
我想说...
If I may say so...

1622
01:19:16,314 --> 01:19:18,214
这样并不好
that did not go very well.

1623
01:19:18,249 --> 01:19:21,309
这是一个公主应该有的行为吗?
Is this the way a princess should act?

1624
01:19:21,352 --> 01:19:24,014
据我所知是那个男孩利用了她
My information tells me that boy was using her.

1625
01:19:24,055 --> 01:19:26,148
那个吻只是个工具...
The kiss was merely a device...

1626
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:28,954
这样他就出15分钟的风头
so that he could get his 15 minutes of fame.

1627
01:19:28,993 --> 01:19:30,483
她的朋友也没有帮忙
And her friends didn't help, either.

1628
01:19:30,528 --> 01:19:33,554
什么Anna Falana Banana Bandana Montana...
Anna, Falana, Banana, Bandana, Montana...

1629
01:19:33,598 --> 01:19:35,964
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1630
01:19:36,033 --> 01:19:37,864
为什么她没有足够的常识...
Why didn't she have enough common sense...

1631
01:19:37,935 --> 01:19:39,129
去处理好这些?
to deal with this?

1632
01:19:39,203 --> 01:19:40,670
她只有15岁...
She's only 15...

1633
01:19:40,738 --> 01:19:43,707
但是今天 她表现地比她的实际年龄要成熟
but today, she acted beyond her years.

1634
01:19:43,741 --> 01:19:46,301
她表现出了极大的尊重...
She showed great respect...

1635
01:19:46,344 --> 01:19:47,971
温和地接受你的批评
and gracefully accepted your criticism.

1636
01:19:48,012 --> 01:19:51,072
你是说作为一个女王 我对她太苛刻了
You're saying that as a queen, I was too harsh on her.

1637
01:19:51,115 --> 01:19:53,743
我批评的是一个...
I was critical of the person...

1638
01:19:53,785 --> 01:19:56,948
有可能成为我们国家下一个统治者的人
who could become the next ruler of my country.

1639
01:19:56,988 --> 01:19:58,546
不 我是说 作为一个奶奶...
No. I'm saying, as a grandmother...

1640
01:19:58,589 --> 01:20:02,184
你也许对你的孙女太苛刻了
you might have been too harsh on your granddaughter.

1641
01:20:06,164 --> 01:20:08,359
你认为她能行吗?
Do you think she can do it?

1642
01:20:08,432 --> 01:20:11,401
哦 我丝毫不怀疑 夫人
Oh, l have no doubts, ma'am.

1643
01:20:11,469 --> 01:20:13,767
我也这样想
I thought so, too.

1644
01:20:17,175 --> 01:20:19,803
什么让你改变
What makes you different

1645
01:20:19,844 --> 01:20:22,438
让你更美丽
Makes you beautiful

1646
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,380
你内心的光芒
What's there inside you

1647
01:20:24,415 --> 01:20:27,816
照进我的胸膛
Shines through to me

1648
01:20:27,852 --> 01:20:30,252
在你的眼中我看见
In your eyes I see

1649
01:20:30,288 --> 01:20:34,054
我需要的全部的爱
All the love I'll ever need

1650
01:20:34,091 --> 01:20:35,922
嘿 是Mia Thermopolips
Hey, it's Mia Thermopolips.

1651
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:39,726
能给我签名照吗? Josh就给了
Can you autograph your picture? Josh did.

1652
01:20:39,764 --> 01:20:41,959
嘿 Princess生气了
Hey, there's Princess Pucker-up.

1653
01:20:43,367 --> 01:20:46,928
什么让你改变更加美丽
What makes you different makes you beautiful

1654
01:20:47,004 --> 01:20:49,472
你内心的光芒
What's there inside you

1655
01:20:49,507 --> 01:20:52,203
照进我的胸膛
Shines through to me

1656
01:20:52,243 --> 01:20:54,677
在你眼中我看见
In your eyes I see

1657
01:20:54,712 --> 01:20:57,112
我需要的全部的爱
All the love I'll ever need

1658
01:20:57,148 --> 01:20:58,615
Lilly?
Lilly?

1659
01:20:58,649 --> 01:21:02,745
嘿 我能和你谈一下吗?
Hey, can I talk to you for a minute, please?

1660
01:21:02,787 --> 01:21:05,620
Lilly 我能和你谈一下吗?
Lilly, can l just talk to you for a minute?

1661
01:21:05,656 --> 01:21:08,921
-好不好?  -当然 谈吧
-ls that cool?  -Sure. Let's talk.

1662
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,121
但是谈什么 嗯?
But about what, hmm?

1663
01:21:11,162 --> 01:21:12,789
关于你怎么伤了我弟弟的心...
How you broke my brother's heart...

1664
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:14,923
或是怎么在我的电视节目上...
or how you stuck me with Jeremiah...

1665
01:21:14,966 --> 01:21:16,331
把我和Jeremiah晾在那儿...
during my cable show doing...

1666
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,664
"选一张牌 选一张牌" 嗯 嗯 嗯!
"Pick a card, pick a card". Mwah mwah mwah!

1667
01:21:18,736 --> 01:21:19,896
对不起 好吗?
I'm sorry, OK?

1668
01:21:19,971 --> 01:21:21,165
我忘了打电话告诉你...
I forgot to call you and tell you...

1669
01:21:21,239 --> 01:21:22,263
我不能来了
that I couldn't make it.

1670
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:24,604
所以我陷入快乐Houdini(一位美国魔术大师的名字 指魔术)
So I was stuck with the Happy Houdini...

1671
01:21:24,642 --> 01:21:26,974
你却和航海怪出游
while you make out with the Yachting Yahoo.

1672
01:21:27,011 --> 01:21:28,842
很对仗
Those are really good alliterations.

1673
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,075
不! 我不想谈什么对仗!
No! I don't want to talk about alliterations!

1674
01:21:31,115 --> 01:21:33,845
Lilly 我来是告诉你我很抱歉!
Lilly, I came up here to tell you that I'm sorry!

1675
01:21:33,885 --> 01:21:36,115
我很抱歉没去你的电视节目...
I'm sorry I missed your cable show...

1676
01:21:36,153 --> 01:21:39,452
我真的很抱歉
and I'm just really sorry.

1677
01:21:39,490 --> 01:21:43,187
我不能相信在我为你付出之后...
I can't believe that you hung me up...

1678
01:21:43,227 --> 01:21:44,956
你却把我晾在那儿
after all l did for you.

1679
01:21:44,996 --> 01:21:47,226
我替你保守皇家秘密
I kept your royal secret.

1680
01:21:47,265 --> 01:21:48,857
你知道在电视节目里保守秘密...
And do you know how hard it is...

1681
01:21:48,933 --> 01:21:50,764
有多难吗?
to have a cable show and keep a secret?

1682
01:21:50,835 --> 01:21:52,359
你没为我保守什么秘密...
You didn't keep it a secret from me...

1683
01:21:52,436 --> 01:21:54,666
你认为要我做公主太糟糕了

好吧 恭喜你 如愿了

但是我希望你做

什么?
What?

1690
01:22:08,119 --> 01:22:09,643
我不是有意的
I didn't mean it.

1691
01:22:09,687 --> 01:22:12,247
只是有点嫉妒...
The green monster of jealousy came out...

1692
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:14,485
因为你很受欢迎...
because you were Miss Popular...

1693
01:22:14,525 --> 01:22:16,493
我就以为要失去自己最好的朋友了...

1694
01:22:16,527 --> 01:22:20,429
所以我很生气很失落很受伤还...

但事实是...
But the truth is...

1698

你成为公主简直是个奇迹

1699
01:22:30,808 --> 01:22:32,435
哇! 不!

Wanting to rock the worId, but having zip power like me...

1706
01:22:46,958 --> 01:22:48,619

但是你...哇!

1709
01:22:52,964 --> 01:22:56,161
什么这么"哇"?
What is so "Wow"?

1710
01:22:57,835 --> 01:23:00,702
哇就是有能力施加影响...

有多少青少年有这种能力?

1713
01:23:04,241 --> 01:23:06,038
你还想要什么样的奇迹?

1714

嗯...

01:23:07,545 --> 01:23:11,379
我们只是想找个不一样的奇迹
we'll just have to find a different miracle.

1716
01:23:11,415 --> 01:23:14,680
不是更多 而是不一样的奇迹
Not more, just different.

Listen, Jere. My friends and I were wondering.

The sweater you're wearing...was it designed for you...

1831
01:28:18,956 --> 01:28:20,890
还是缝纫机爆了?

1832
01:28:20,924 --> 01:28:22,687
太阳镜 姑娘们
Sunglasses, girls.

1833

Jeremiah的头发太夺目了
It's Jeremiah hair glare.

1834
01:28:25,229 --> 01:28:27,754
是你用魔术把头发变成这样的吧?

1835
01:28:27,798 --> 01:28:29,390

1839

1840
01:28:37,775 --> 01:28:39,572
当然了!
Of course it does!

1841

没错 但是你知道吗?
Yeah, I am, but you know what?

1843
01:28:50,087 --> 01:28:51,179
有一天我也许不再是了...
Someday I might grow out of that...

1844
01:28:51,221 --> 01:28:54,054
但你永远都会是个笨蛋
but you will never stop being a jerk.

1845
01:28:54,091 --> 01:28:56,616

1850
01:29:05,369 --> 01:29:08,270
哦 没有 亲爱的 对不起
Oh, no, honey, I'm sorry.

1851

我在开一个重要会议

1854
01:29:27,458 --> 01:29:30,325
这是你父亲给你的...

在他的遗物中找到的

我的生日要两周才到

1858
01:29:37,868 --> 01:29:39,062
我知道...
I know...

1859
01:29:39,136 --> 01:29:41,263
但是我希望你在我们离开之前收到它
but I wanted you to have it before we leave.

1860
01:29:41,338 --> 01:29:44,307
后天我回Genovia

1861

1863
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:53,043
如果你把我给你的链子打开...

1864
01:29:53,083 --> 01:29:54,607

谢谢你把它带来

我也是来道歉的...

1867
01:30:01,058 --> 01:30:03,788
因为沙滩上的事故我态度不好
for the way I spoke to you about the beach incident.

1868
01:30:03,827 --> 01:30:05,158
我太严厉了
It was judgemental of me.

1869
01:30:05,195 --> 01:30:08,289
我没有弄清真相
I didn't pause to verify the facts.

1870
01:30:08,332 --> 01:30:09,993
没关系 奶奶
That's all right, Grandma.

1871
01:30:10,067 --> 01:30:13,298
我最近想了很多...
I've been thinking about it a great deal...

1872
01:30:13,370 --> 01:30:14,462
事实是...
and the truth is...

1873
01:30:14,538 --> 01:30:17,837
我认为你会是个好公主
I think you'd make a very fine princess.

1874
01:30:17,875 --> 01:30:19,536
你知道 人们以为...
You know, people think...

1875
01:30:19,576 --> 01:30:21,635
公主应该戴着皇冠...
princesses are supposed to wear tiaras...

1876
01:30:21,678 --> 01:30:23,737
嫁给王子 总是那么漂亮...

1877
01:30:23,781 --> 01:30:26,045
永远幸福地生活...
and live happily ever after...

1878
01:30:26,083 --> 01:30:28,347
但是远不止这些
but it's so much more than that.

1879
01:30:28,385 --> 01:30:30,785
这是个实际的工作
It's a real job.

1880
01:30:34,792 --> 01:30:39,456
你是个了不起的人 奶奶...
You are an extraordinary person, Grandma...

1881
01:30:39,496 --> 01:30:42,192
但是我认为我不应该做这些
but I don't think I'm meant to do this.

1882
01:30:42,266 --> 01:30:45,895
我很害怕...
I would be so afraid...

1883
01:30:45,969 --> 01:30:49,735
害怕会让Genovia的人民失望...
that I would disappoint the people of Genovia...

1884
01:30:49,773 --> 01:30:51,502
而且我不能...
and I couldn't bear...

1885
01:30:51,542 --> 01:30:54,841
再让你失望了
to disappoint you again.

1886
01:30:57,948 --> 01:31:00,041
那么 就像我说过的...
Well, as I said...

1887
01:31:00,083 --> 01:31:02,643
我对你有信心

1888
01:31:07,524 --> 01:31:09,515
-我是个作家  -啊!
-I'm a writer.  -Ah!

1889

我写肥皂...肥皂剧

1890
01:31:13,363 --> 01:31:15,024
你看过"穿房而过"吗?

1891
01:31:15,065 --> 01:31:16,965
没有 没有
No. No, no.

1892
01:31:17,034 --> 01:31:18,763
很火爆的
It's a big hit.

1893
01:31:18,836 --> 01:31:20,736
有一次我写了一个很像你的人物
I wrote a character just like you once.

1894
01:31:20,771 --> 01:31:21,829
他是个间谍
He was a spy.

1895
01:31:21,905 --> 01:31:23,463
我不是间谍
I'm not a spy.

1896
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:26,134
剧中人也是这么说的
That's what the character said.

1897
01:31:27,544 --> 01:31:28,636
这样 我们今晚见

我想让你帮个忙

1899
01:31:37,955 --> 01:31:40,924
我想让你在舞会上对媒体正式宣布...

1900
01:31:40,958 --> 01:31:45,054
放弃你的头衔 知道吗?

-发表演讲?  -嗯
-Make a speech?  -Mm-hmm.

1902
01:31:47,798 --> 01:31:50,665
你不认为也许...
Do you think that maybe...

1903
01:31:50,734 --> 01:31:52,634
考虑到我和媒体不快的历史...
considering my history with the press...

1904
01:31:52,669 --> 01:31:53,863
你来说会好些吗?

1905

Amelia 你不会因为几只虫子撞上了挡风玻璃...
Amelia, you wouldn't stop driving your Mustang...

1906
01:31:57,774 --> 01:32:00,834
就不再开你的野马了吧?
just because a couple of insects hit the windshield?

1907
01:32:00,878 --> 01:32:02,971
另外 还要看看你进步了多少...
Besides, look how far you've come...

1908
01:32:03,013 --> 01:32:04,708
我会在那儿陪你

1909
01:32:04,748 --> 01:32:06,716
我会让Joseph七点来接你

2098
01:42:19,529 --> 01:42:23,295
我父亲帮助了我
My father helped me.

2099
01:42:23,333 --> 01:42:25,631
今晚早些时候 我还想...
Earlier this evening, I had every intention...

2100
01:42:25,702 --> 01:42:30,298
放弃我的王位...
of giving up my claim to the throne...

2101
01:42:30,373 --> 01:42:37,074
我妈妈帮助了我 告诉我没关系...
and my mother helped me by telling me that it was OK...

2102
01:42:37,113 --> 01:42:42,483
而且一如既往地支持我
and by supporting me like she has for my entire life.

2103
01:42:42,519 --> 01:42:44,714
但是...
But...

2104
01:42:44,754 --> 01:42:47,188
之后我在想...
then I wondered how I'd feel...

2105
01:42:47,223 --> 01:42:50,420
放弃Genovia公主的头衔之后会是什么感觉
after abdicating my role as Princess of Genovia.

2106
01:42:50,460 --> 01:42:53,793
我会感到解脱还是难过?
Would I feel relieved or would l feel sad?

2107
01:42:53,830 --> 01:42:56,663
然后我意识到...
And then I realized...

2108
01:42:56,699 --> 01:43:01,432
一天之中我愚蠢地用了多少次"我"啊
how many stupid times a day I use the word "I".

2109
01:43:01,504 --> 01:43:04,268
实际上 也许我做的所有事都是...
In fact, probabIy all I ever do...

2110
01:43:04,307 --> 01:43:05,672
只想到我自己
is think about myself.

2111
01:43:05,708 --> 01:43:06,970
这太差劲了...
And how lame is that...

2112
01:43:07,010 --> 01:43:09,001
当这个星球上还有另外70亿人...
when there are 7 billion other people on the planet...

2113
01:43:10,547 --> 01:43:13,778
哦 对不起 我说得太快了
Ooh. Sorry. I'm going too fast.

2114
01:43:13,816 --> 01:43:16,876
但是然后我想...
But then I thought...

2115
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:20,014
如果我能考虑一下另外70亿人...
if I cared about the other 7 billion out there...

2116
01:43:20,056 --> 01:43:22,422
而不是我自己...
instead of just me...

2117
01:43:22,458 --> 01:43:25,359
我的生活也许会更有意义
that's probably a much better use of my time.

2118
01:43:25,395 --> 01:43:31,459
看 如果我是Genovia的公主...
See, if I were Princess of Genovia...

2119
01:43:31,534 --> 01:43:33,001
那么我的想法...
then my thoughts...

2120
01:43:33,036 --> 01:43:36,802
和比我聪明的人的想法...
and the thoughts of people smarter than me...

2121
01:43:36,839 --> 01:43:40,832
就能更好被接纳 也许...
would be much better heard and just maybe...

2122
01:43:40,877 --> 01:43:44,404
那些想法就有可能付诸现实
those thoughts could be turned into actions.

2123
01:43:46,182 --> 01:43:49,276
所以今天早上我起床的时候...
So this morning when I woke up...

2124
01:43:49,319 --> 01:43:52,288
我还是Mia Thermopolis
I was Mia Thermopolis.

2125
01:43:52,322 --> 01:43:54,882
但是现在...
But now...

2126
01:43:57,193 --> 01:44:01,527
我选择永远做...
I choose to be forevermore...

2127
01:44:01,564 --> 01:44:05,523
Amelia Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi...
Amelia Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi...

2128
01:44:05,602 --> 01:44:09,038
Genovia的公主
Princess of Genovia.

2129
01:44:20,416 --> 01:44:24,876
我希望你们还没订文具用品
I hope you didn't order your stationery yet.

2130
01:44:24,921 --> 01:44:27,515
这是我的第一顶王冠
This was my very first tiara.

2131
01:44:27,557 --> 01:44:28,785
我更喜欢这顶
I was rather fond of it.

2132
01:44:28,825 --> 01:44:31,259
我喜欢你也会喜欢
I'm hoping you will be, too.

2133
01:44:32,328 --> 01:44:35,764
哦 奶奶 你都准备好了
Oh. Grandma, but you had it already.

2134
01:44:35,798 --> 01:44:36,924
你怎么知道我会来?
How did you know I'd even be here?

2135
01:44:36,966 --> 01:44:40,231
因为我在你身上发现了和我认识的某个人...
Because I recognize the same spirit in you...

2136
01:44:40,303 --> 01:44:41,930
一样的精神
as someone else I know.

2137
01:44:42,005 --> 01:44:43,563
谁?
Who?

2138
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:45,801
我
Me.

2139
01:44:47,644 --> 01:44:48,736
啊 你到了
Ah, you made it.

2140
01:44:48,778 --> 01:44:51,042
当然了 你个大个子
You bet your life, you big, tall string bean.

2141
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:53,878
拿着 Paolo来救场了
Here. Paolo here to save the day.

2142
01:44:53,916 --> 01:44:57,181
Genovia
Genovia

2143
01:44:57,220 --> 01:45:01,623
那是我的家
The land I call my home

2144
01:45:01,658 --> 01:45:07,426
Genovia Genovia
Genovia, Genovia

2145
01:45:07,463 --> 01:45:14,960
你的旗帜永远飘扬
Forever will your banner wave

2146
01:45:15,038 --> 01:45:17,598
女王陛下Clarisse...
Her Majesty, Queen Clarisse...

2147
01:45:17,674 --> 01:45:22,839
和她尊贵的Amelia Genovia的公主
and Her Royal Highness, Amelia, Princess of Genovia.

2148
01:45:27,750 --> 01:45:30,150
我觉得我们现在最好把你弄干
I think perhaps we'd better get you dried off now.

2149
01:45:30,186 --> 01:45:32,245
谢谢
Thank you.

2150
01:45:36,526 --> 01:45:39,654
Mia不再上演"失踪记"
No longer does Mia stand for"Missing In Action".

2151
01:45:39,696 --> 01:45:41,596
Genovia有了新公主
Genovia has a new princess.

2152
01:47:15,324 --> 01:47:16,655
他们和我的想法一样...
They had the same idea I had...

2153
01:47:16,692 --> 01:47:18,091
但是现在花园 "被占用了"
but now the garden is "occupado".

2154
01:47:30,306 --> 01:47:31,830
为什么选我?
Why me?

2155
01:47:33,976 --> 01:47:36,968
因为我透明的时候你还能看见我
Because you saw me when I was invisible.

2156
01:47:38,714 --> 01:47:40,944
就因为我是皇族...
And just because I'm royal...

2157
01:47:40,983 --> 01:47:42,109
并不意味着我有任何不同
doesn't mean I'm any different.

2158
01:47:42,151 --> 01:47:43,584
拜托 我还是原来的我
Come on, I'm really the same person.

2159
01:47:43,619 --> 01:47:45,280
对 我会住在Genovia...
Yes, I will have to live in Genovia...

2160
01:47:45,321 --> 01:47:47,983
但是我还是会去上学...
but I'll still go to school and...

2161
01:48:30,933 --> 01:48:35,267
你告诉我信心还在
You showed me faith is not gone

2162
01:48:35,304 --> 01:48:39,764
我不需要恃风飞翔
I don't need wind to help me fly

2163
01:48:39,842 --> 01:48:43,972
奇迹偶尔会出现
Miracles happen once in a while

2164
01:48:44,013 --> 01:48:48,211
只要你相信
When you believe

2165
01:48:48,251 --> 01:48:52,517
你告诉我梦会成真
You showed me dreams come to life

2166
01:48:52,555 --> 01:48:56,457
尝试一下没有错
That taking a chance on us was right

2167
01:48:56,492 --> 01:49:00,326
很快一切就会降临
All things will come with a little time

2168
01:49:00,363 --> 01:49:03,423
只要你相信
When you believe

2169
01:49:03,466 --> 01:49:04,933

2172
01:49:10,072 --> 01:49:11,801
我要在旅行皇室职责之前...

2173
01:49:11,841 --> 01:49:13,365
会见国会和群众

and will continue painting...without the balloons.

2176

Lilly和Michael会在我们的...你能相信吗...宫殿里...
Lilly and Michael are spending their summer vacation...

2177
01:49:23,252 --> 01:49:26,278
度过暑假
at our...can you believe it...palace.

2178
01:49:26,322 --> 01:49:28,552
他们甚至把我的野马也带来了...
They're even having my Mustang brought over...

2179
01:49:28,591 --> 01:49:31,651
两周后我就能合法驾驶了

2180
01:49:31,694 --> 01:49:33,958
奶奶很高兴回家
Grandma's so glad to be going home.

2181

Joseph呢? 他还是一如既往地在侧护卫
And Joseph? Well, he's watching nearby as usual.

2182
01:49:37,533 --> 01:49:39,330
每个人都对加冕礼有点紧张...
Everybody's got pre-coronation jitters...

2183
01:49:39,402 --> 01:49:40,801

2184

每个人 就是 除了肥Louie

2185

他对皇室生活非常适应

2186
01:49:46,809 --> 01:49:48,970
我猜他一直都是这样
I guess he was one all along.

2187
01:49:50,479 --> 01:49:53,471
公主 看窗外...
Princess, look out the window...

2188
01:49:53,516 --> 01:49:56,713
欢迎来到Genovia
and welcome to Genovia.
