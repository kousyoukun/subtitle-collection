1
00:00:37,677 --> 00:00:40,095
Five thousand years ago,

2
00:00:40,221 --> 00:00:43,265
a fierce warrior
known as the Scorpion King...

3
00:00:43,349 --> 00:00:45,308
led a great army
on a campaign...

4
00:00:45,434 --> 00:00:47,310
to conquer the known world.

5
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:13,467
after a vicious campaign
which lasted seven long years,

6
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:16,178
the Scorpion King and his army
were defeated...

7
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:20,056
and driven deep
into the sacred desert
of Ahm Shere.

8
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:47,080
One by one,
they slowly perished
under the scorching sun...

9
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:53,169
until only the great warrior
himself was left alive.

10
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:02,260
Near death,

11
00:03:02,386 --> 00:03:06,305
the Scorpion King made a pact
with the dark god Anubis...

12
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:09,099
that if Anubis
would spare his life...

13
00:03:09,225 --> 00:03:11,852
and let him conquer
his enemies,

14
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:14,521
he would give him his soul.

15
00:03:22,028 --> 00:03:25,697
Anubis accepted his offer
and spared his life.

16
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:57,392
Anubis gave the Scorpion King
command of his army,

17
00:03:57,517 --> 00:04:00,018
and like an evil flood,

18
00:04:00,102 --> 00:04:03,437
they washed away all
that lay before them.

19
00:04:14,365 --> 00:04:18,076
When his task was done, Anubis
forced the Scorpion King...

20
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,204
to serve him for all time.

21
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:31,587
His army was returned
to the sands
from whence they came,

22
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:39,219
where they wait, silently,

23
00:04:39,303 --> 00:04:41,596
to be awakened once again.

24
00:04:41,597 --> 00:04:42,139
to be awakened once again.

25
00:06:18,097 --> 00:06:20,265
Alex?

26
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:23,184
What were you thinking,
a mummy had come back to life?

27
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,937
I'll tell you a story
some time.

28
00:06:26,062 --> 00:06:28,105
What are you doing down here?
I told you to wait for us
up in the temple.

29
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:29,982
But, Dad, I saw-
No "buts." It's dangerous
down here, Alex.

30
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:32,818
But I saw your tattoo.
You saw what?

31
00:06:32,902 --> 00:06:36,529
On a wall by the entrance.
There's a cartouche
just like it.

32
00:06:36,655 --> 00:06:40,699
With the pyramid and the eye
and the two kings
and everything.

33
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:43,327
Really?
Yeah.

34
00:06:43,411 --> 00:06:46,121
Okay, well, I'll be up
to take a look at that
in a minute.

35
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:48,957
In the meantime, I want you
to wait for us up there.
But-But-

36
00:06:49,082 --> 00:06:52,126
No, pick up your stuff,
and I'll see you up
in the temple. Go.

37
00:06:53,795 --> 00:06:57,506
Go on.
And-And what
shall I do?

38
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,050
I don't know.
Surprise me.

39
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:02,218
Build a better mousetrap.
Okay.

40
00:07:02,344 --> 00:07:04,804
While your mother goes
and desecrates another tomb.

41
00:07:19,817 --> 00:07:21,484
Go away.

42
00:07:21,652 --> 00:07:24,570
Those are poisonous,
you know.

43
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:26,406
Only if they bite you.

44
00:07:26,532 --> 00:07:29,075
What was all that about?
Oh, nothing.

45
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:32,036
Alex wanted
to show me something.

46
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,038
I swear,

47
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:37,040
the kid gets more and more
like you every day.

48
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,417
What, you mean
more attractive, sweet...

49
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,419
and devilishly charming?

50
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,587
No, he's driving me crazy.

51
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,589
Now, where were we?

52
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,591
Hammer and chisel.

53
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:55,597
All right, all right!
Let's do it your way.

54
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:58,017
Thank you.

55
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:18,450
Ever since I had that dream,

56
00:08:18,535 --> 00:08:21,287
this place is all
I can think about.

57
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:24,748
Ever since you had that dream,
I haven't had a decent night
of sleep.

58
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,752
I feel like
I've been here before.

59
00:08:28,836 --> 00:08:31,963
I know I've been here before.
Evy, nobody's
been here before.

60
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:35,424
Not in at least 3,000 years.
Except for these guys.

61
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:43,806
Then how do I seem to know
exactly where I'm going?

62
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,321
Let's go.

63
00:09:33,892 --> 00:09:37,102
Knock, knock.
Anybody home?

64
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:43,691
You two check out that stuff,
see if it's there.

65
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:46,194
-I'll sort out the O'Connells.

66
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:21,610
You know,
if you move that fast enough,
you can almost write your name.

67
00:11:21,694 --> 00:11:24,112
I just had a vision.

68
00:11:24,196 --> 00:11:26,280
It was-
It was like my dream,

69
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:28,283
but it was real.

70
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,285
It was like I was actually
here in ancient times.

71
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:33,329
Well, if you
actually were here,

72
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:36,290
could you show me
how to open this thing?

73
00:11:36,415 --> 00:11:38,291
Hold this.

74
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:54,931
All right,
now you're starting
to scare me.

75
00:11:55,056 --> 00:11:56,974
Now I'm starting
to scare myself.

76
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,978
What is this?
Look at the state
of this rubbish.

77
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:04,731
Those Egyptians
never had a clue.
It's all chintz and stuff.

78
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,775
Look at that.

79
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:10,485
Cheap pottery, this.
Ancient rubbish.

80
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,614
Aaah!

81
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:15,657
Jacques,
something's hit me head!

82
00:12:15,783 --> 00:12:18,660
Shut up, Spivey.
This place is cursed.

83
00:12:21,997 --> 00:12:24,582
We do not want
to wake the gods.

84
00:12:40,763 --> 00:12:43,181
Ohh! Aaah!
Aah! Aah! Aah!

85
00:12:46,226 --> 00:12:48,686
That's the emblem
of the Scorpion King.

86
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,188
He's supposed to be
pure myth.

87
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:54,190
No-No trace of him
has ever been found before.

88
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:57,193
No artifacts,
no archival evidence.

89
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:00,112
Maybe they didn't want
anybody to find him.
Let's open this.

90
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,865
Evy, I don't have
a real good feeling
about this.

91
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:06,577
It's only a chest.
No harm ever came
from opening a chest.

92
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,537
Right, and no harm ever came
from reading a book.

93
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,039
Remember
how that went?
We can't stop now.

94
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:15,167
Just remember,
I was the voice
of reason here.
For once.

95
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:19,379
Rubbish. Rubbish.
Dreck. Chintz.

96
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:22,506
Only half of this-

97
00:13:24,426 --> 00:13:26,886
God, that hurt!

98
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:49,238
Hon?
Let's do it your way.

99
00:14:07,797 --> 00:14:10,090
The bracelet of Anubis.

100
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:20,390
I'll take care of this.

101
00:14:26,522 --> 00:14:28,231
Oh, my God.

102
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:31,066
It's a bit late
for that!

103
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:34,444
Put it in your rucksack.
I got a better idea.
Let's leave it here.

104
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:38,114
I think it's a bit late
for that!
What's it say?

105
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,243
"He who disturbs this bracelet
shall drink from the Nile."

106
00:14:42,327 --> 00:14:44,036
That doesn't sound too bad.

107
00:15:02,386 --> 00:15:06,680
Jacques's gonna make a nice
fillet out of you, my son.

108
00:15:08,432 --> 00:15:11,309
-Oh, please. Please.
-Spivey! Jacques!

109
00:15:11,436 --> 00:15:14,438
-Let's get the hell outta here!
-Come on!

110
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,737
-Come on!

111
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:08,109
Whoa.

112
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:18,118
This is bad, Evy!

113
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,369
We've had bad before!
This is worse!

114
00:16:59,112 --> 00:17:03,406
Mom, Dad,
I can explain everything.

115
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:33,600
The Book of the Dead
gives life.

116
00:17:33,725 --> 00:17:36,268
And the Book
of the Living...

117
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:41,273
takes life away.

118
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:44,276
I thought
that was my job.

119
00:17:46,486 --> 00:17:48,445
We're getting close.

120
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,806
Did you acquire it?

121
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,120
We're getting very close.

122
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:49,677
We've found him.

123
00:19:51,804 --> 00:19:54,806
We've found him!
We've found him!

124
00:20:11,696 --> 00:20:14,072
Step a side here.
Out of the way!

125
00:20:19,078 --> 00:20:20,954
Imhotep.

126
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:23,289
It's him.
It's Imhotep.

127
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:30,545
Now we must raise those
that serve him.

128
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,588
Get out of my way.

129
00:20:32,672 --> 00:20:35,590
Get out of my way,
or I'm gonna shoot you
in the face.

130
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:37,718
He means it.
He shot someone
before.

131
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:42,222
-Give it to me.
-The, uh, opportunity
passed us by.

132
00:20:43,307 --> 00:20:45,016
We need that bracelet.

133
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:47,934
And we need it
before it opens.

134
00:20:51,356 --> 00:20:52,773
Enough.

135
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:57,443
My dear Hafez,

136
00:20:57,569 --> 00:20:59,487
I told you
I should have handled it.

137
00:20:59,488 --> 00:21:00,447
I told you
I should have handled it.

138
00:21:00,572 --> 00:21:05,409
I did not want
your past history
to cloud the issue.

139
00:21:05,493 --> 00:21:07,744
We know where it is.
We'll take care of it.

140
00:21:07,828 --> 00:21:10,246
No,
we'll take care of it.

141
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:13,249
I have a different chore
for you now.

142
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:17,211
-Where is the bracelet?
-It's on its way
to merry old London.

143
00:21:18,504 --> 00:21:21,381
Then London
is where we must go.

144
00:21:38,813 --> 00:21:41,857
I think the bracelet
is some sort of guide...

145
00:21:41,983 --> 00:21:44,359
to the lost oasis
of Ahm Shere.

146
00:21:44,485 --> 00:21:46,861
Evy, I know
what you're thinking,

147
00:21:46,987 --> 00:21:48,863
and the answer is no.

148
00:21:48,989 --> 00:21:50,865
We just got home.

149
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,867
That's the beauty of it.
We're already packed.

150
00:21:53,993 --> 00:21:57,162
Why don't you just give me
one good reason.

151
00:21:57,246 --> 00:21:59,289
It's just an oasis,

152
00:22:00,832 --> 00:22:02,666
darling.

153
00:22:03,752 --> 00:22:05,753
A beautiful,

154
00:22:05,837 --> 00:22:08,380
exciting,

155
00:22:08,506 --> 00:22:10,382
romantic...

156
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,468
oasis.

157
00:22:13,552 --> 00:22:15,470
Mmm.

158
00:22:15,554 --> 00:22:18,973
The kind with
the white, sandy beach
and the palm trees...

159
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:22,183
and the cool,
clear, blue water and-

160
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:26,312
We could have
some of those big drinks
with the little umbrellas.

161
00:22:26,438 --> 00:22:28,481
Sounds good.
Sounds too good.

162
00:22:28,607 --> 00:22:30,525
What's the catch?

163
00:22:30,608 --> 00:22:32,526
Supposedly
it's the resting place
of Anubis's army.

164
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,528
See?
I knew there's a catch.
There's always a catch.

165
00:22:35,613 --> 00:22:39,532
And let me guess.
It was commanded by
that Scorpion King guy?

166
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,534
Yes, but he only awakens
once every 5,000 years.
Right.

167
00:22:42,618 --> 00:22:46,579
And if someone doesn't kill him,
he's gonna wipe out the world.
How did you know?

168
00:22:46,622 --> 00:22:49,040
I didn't. But that's
always the story.

169
00:22:49,124 --> 00:22:53,544
The last known expedition
to actually reach Ahm Shere
was sent by Ramses the Fourth...

170
00:22:53,628 --> 00:22:55,546
over
3,000 years ago.

171
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,173
He sent over a thousand men.
And none of them
was ever seen again.

172
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:00,717
How did you know?
I didn't.
But that's always the story.

173
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:02,719
Did I mention there was
a pyramid of gold?
Twice.

174
00:23:02,844 --> 00:23:05,971
Alexander the Great
sent troops in search of it.
Hooray for him.

175
00:23:06,056 --> 00:23:09,100
So did Caesar.
Yeah, look what happened
to his career.

176
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:12,143
And Napoleon.
But we're smarter than him.
And taller too.

177
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:16,355
-Exactly. That's why
we're gonna find it.
-Because we're taller?

178
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,358
Mmm.
That's why I love you.

179
00:23:19,443 --> 00:23:20,610
Nice try.

180
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:43,213
Mom!

181
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,214
What do I do
with this chest?

182
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,382
This sucker
weighs a goddang ton.

183
00:23:47,466 --> 00:23:49,384
Alex,
watch your language!

184
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,262
Rather weighty, this.

185
00:23:55,432 --> 00:23:58,726
-Huh?

186
00:24:01,354 --> 00:24:05,106
Evy, that first weird dream
of yours was exactly
six weeks ago, right?

187
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,734
I think so, yes.
But what's that got to do
with anything?

188
00:24:08,818 --> 00:24:11,945
It just happens to coincide
with Egyptian New Year.

189
00:24:13,656 --> 00:24:16,032
Oh. That's right.
What a coincidence.

190
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:21,787
Maybe.
All I'm saying is,
let's be cautious.

191
00:24:26,584 --> 00:24:28,502
Oh!

192
00:24:30,713 --> 00:24:34,048
If anything happened to you,
I would never forgive myself.

193
00:24:39,386 --> 00:24:41,304
Aah!

194
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:57,276
You and Alex
are the only thing
that matter to me.

195
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:59,779
Well,

196
00:24:59,863 --> 00:25:03,407
the Bembridge scholars
have been begging me...

197
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,868
to run
the British Museum.

198
00:25:14,042 --> 00:25:16,001
Wh-Whoa.

199
00:25:16,127 --> 00:25:18,503
Oh.

200
00:25:22,465 --> 00:25:25,717
Aw, cripes, how do you
get this thing off?

201
00:25:25,844 --> 00:25:28,721
Have I kissed you today?

202
00:25:36,311 --> 00:25:39,188
I hate it
when you do that.

203
00:25:39,314 --> 00:25:42,399
Why?
Makes me feel
like agreeing to anything.

204
00:25:42,525 --> 00:25:45,193
Anything?
Mm-hmm.

205
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,949
Those knickers
are not mine.

206
00:25:53,075 --> 00:25:55,535
Jonathan.

207
00:25:55,662 --> 00:25:58,038
Hey, Alex,
behave yourself
for five minutes.

208
00:25:58,122 --> 00:26:00,040
You betcha.

209
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:10,840
Happy to be home?

210
00:26:10,966 --> 00:26:12,467
Couldn't be happier.

211
00:26:12,592 --> 00:26:15,135
It's the year
of the scorpion.

212
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,138
Neat!
Thought you might
like that.

213
00:26:17,222 --> 00:26:20,140
So then I killed the mummy
and all his minions...

214
00:26:20,224 --> 00:26:22,142
and stole his scepter.

215
00:26:22,226 --> 00:26:25,144
Oh, you're so brave.
And rich.
Did I mention rich?

216
00:26:25,228 --> 00:26:27,896
What do you think
I'm doing here?

217
00:26:30,275 --> 00:26:32,193
Sorry. We must be
in the wrong house.

218
00:26:32,276 --> 00:26:34,611
You said
this was your house.
No, I didn't.

219
00:26:34,737 --> 00:26:37,155
-Call me!

220
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:39,699
-You're not Sheila's
husband, are you?
-No.

221
00:26:39,783 --> 00:26:43,410
Look, if you work for Johnny,
I was gonna pay him back
on Tuesday.

222
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:45,412
I don't know any Johnny.

223
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:48,081
We are looking
for the bracelet of Anubis.

224
00:26:48,249 --> 00:26:51,001
Oh, good for you.
Good thing to have,
the old bracelet of Anubis.

225
00:26:51,085 --> 00:26:55,546
Where is it?
Ah, you're looking here
for the bracelet. I see.

226
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,881
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

227
00:26:58,007 --> 00:27:00,884
Mr. O'Connell,
you try my patience.

228
00:27:00,968 --> 00:27:03,761
Mr. O'Connell?
No, hold on a minute.
You've got the wrong ma-

229
00:27:03,845 --> 00:27:06,430
Aaah! That bracelet.
Now I remember.

230
00:27:06,556 --> 00:27:09,766
-I lost it in a card game.
-For your sake, I hope not.

231
00:27:13,187 --> 00:27:15,522
-It can't be.

232
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:18,899
Hello.

233
00:27:21,444 --> 00:27:23,445
Hello.

234
00:27:23,571 --> 00:27:25,280
Where's your wife?

235
00:27:25,406 --> 00:27:27,699
My wife?
Oh, you mean Evy.

236
00:27:27,824 --> 00:27:30,534
I think she went off
to Baden-Baden
or Tibet or something.

237
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:32,537
The girl's
a free spirit.

238
00:27:32,621 --> 00:27:34,372
Did I mention
I was single now?

239
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,295
Egyptian asps
are quite poisonous.

240
00:27:44,548 --> 00:27:46,883
It's downstairs.
There's a safe.

241
00:27:47,008 --> 00:27:50,302
The combinationis, uh,
uh, 3-20-58-

242
00:27:50,385 --> 00:27:53,095
uh, 3-9-3-something.

243
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,766
It's in a safe downstairs.
I told you. I told you!

244
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,810
-And your point is?
-My point is, I told you
so you wouldn't kill me.

245
00:27:59,894 --> 00:28:02,062
When did we make
that arrangement?

246
00:28:10,028 --> 00:28:13,197
-Uh, hello.

247
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,491
Jonathan, I thought I said
no more wild parties.

248
00:28:15,616 --> 00:28:17,784
Well, when you're popular-

249
00:28:17,868 --> 00:28:21,037
Alex, I'm serious.
If you've lost that key,
you're grounded.

250
00:28:21,162 --> 00:28:24,206
I haven't lost it.
I just can't find it.
There's a difference.

251
00:28:24,332 --> 00:28:27,209
Well, you'd better
start finding it then.

252
00:28:27,335 --> 00:28:29,628
I will, Mom.
There's nothing
to worry about.

253
00:28:29,712 --> 00:28:32,464
Good evening.

254
00:28:34,758 --> 00:28:37,635
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

255
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:40,095
I'm looking for the chest,
of course.

256
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:44,682
Give it to me now.

257
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,687
Get out of my house.

258
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:52,188
Whoa, Mom.
Maybe not the best idea.

259
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,815
Alex, get back there.

260
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,612
Definitely not
the best idea.

261
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,031
I think it's time
to yell for Dad now.

262
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:05,033
-Now I will kill you
and take it anyway.
- I think not.

263
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:10,079
Ardeth, what are you
doing here?

264
00:29:10,164 --> 00:29:12,374
Perhaps explanations
are best kept for later.

265
00:29:12,457 --> 00:29:13,999
Ardeth Bay.

266
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:16,168
Lock-Nah.

267
00:29:16,253 --> 00:29:20,547
Knowing my brother-in-law,
he probably deserves whatever
you're about to do to him,

268
00:29:20,673 --> 00:29:24,175
but this is my house,
I have certain rules
about snakes and dismemberment.

269
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:29,555
-Shoot him!

270
00:29:29,681 --> 00:29:31,974
Aaah!

271
00:29:34,226 --> 00:29:35,727
Aaah!

272
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:01,373
Whoa, Mom!
When did you learn
to do that?

273
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:03,876
I have no idea.

274
00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:10,089
That I learned
from your father.

275
00:30:12,134 --> 00:30:14,344
-I'll take that.
-Whoa!

276
00:30:23,686 --> 00:30:26,563
Not bad for a Medjai.

277
00:30:33,403 --> 00:30:35,279
Let go!

278
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,622
-What's in the chest?
-The bracelet of Anubis!

279
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:05,221
They must not get the bracelet!
Get it and get out of here!

280
00:31:11,644 --> 00:31:13,478
Mom, look out!

281
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:15,480
-Evelyn!

282
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:21,902
Mom!

283
00:31:27,783 --> 00:31:30,118
Jonathan!

284
00:31:30,202 --> 00:31:31,953
Jonathan!

285
00:31:34,372 --> 00:31:36,832
What'd you do
this time?

286
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:39,084
I haven't done anything
to anybody!

287
00:31:41,211 --> 00:31:43,170
Lately.
Come on!

288
00:32:04,106 --> 00:32:06,107
Rick!

289
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:07,859
Evelyn!
Look out, Rick!

290
00:32:18,702 --> 00:32:20,578
Dad! Dad!

291
00:32:20,704 --> 00:32:22,497
Are you all right?

292
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,664
Yeah.
Yeah? Okay.

293
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:28,376
O'Connell.

294
00:32:28,503 --> 00:32:31,880
What are you doing here?
No, scratch that. I don't care.

295
00:32:32,005 --> 00:32:34,089
Who are those guys?
Where are they
taking my wife?

296
00:32:34,215 --> 00:32:37,092
My friend, I'm not sure,

297
00:32:37,218 --> 00:32:41,179
but wherever this man is,
your wife will surely be.

298
00:32:42,556 --> 00:32:44,432
Hey, I know him.

299
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:47,435
He's the curator.
He works at
the British Museum.

300
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:52,063
Are you sure?
Believe him. He spends more
time there than at home.

301
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:56,443
You're here,
the bad guys are here,
Evy's been kidnapped.

302
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:00,029
Let me guess.
Yes, they once again removed
the creature from his grave.

303
00:33:00,155 --> 00:33:03,490
I don't mean to point fingers,
but isn't it your job to
make sure that doesn't happen?

304
00:33:03,574 --> 00:33:06,993
That woman who was with him,
she knows things that no living
person could possibly know.

305
00:33:07,077 --> 00:33:09,495
She knew exactly where
the creature was buried.

306
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:12,707
We were hoping she would
lead us to the bracelet.
She obviously did.

307
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:14,751
And now they have it.

308
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:17,252
I wouldn't
get too nervous
just yet.

309
00:33:19,296 --> 00:33:22,798
Is that gold?
When I stuck it on,
I saw the pyramids at Giza.

310
00:33:22,966 --> 00:33:25,551
Then, whoosh!
Straight across the desert
to Karnak.

311
00:33:25,677 --> 00:33:28,595
By putting this on, you have
started a chain reaction that
could bring the next apocalypse.

312
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:30,763
-You, lighten up.

313
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,767
You, big trouble.
You, get in the car.

314
00:33:39,689 --> 00:33:41,607
I am sorry
if I alarmed your son,

315
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:44,609
but you must understand,
now that the bracelet
is on his wrist,

316
00:33:44,694 --> 00:33:47,237
we have only seven days
before the Scorpion King
awakens.

317
00:33:47,362 --> 00:33:50,948
We? What we?
If he is not killed, he will
raise the army of Anubis.

318
00:33:51,074 --> 00:33:54,618
-I take it
that's not a good thing.
-Oh, he'll wipe out the world.

319
00:33:54,744 --> 00:33:56,954
Ah, the old
"wipe out the world" ploy.

320
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:03,126
Whom ever can kill
the Scorpion King...

321
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:05,128
can send his army
back to the Underworld...

322
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:07,922
or use it to destroy mankind
and rule the Earth.

323
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:12,174
That's why they dug up Imhotep.
He's the only guy tough enough
to take out the Scorpion King.

324
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,426
That is their plan.

325
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:29,691
Alex, I've got
a big job for you.
Stay here and protect the car.

326
00:34:29,858 --> 00:34:32,026
I can do that.
Protect the car?

327
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:35,111
Just because I'm a kid
doesn't mean I'm stupid.

328
00:34:35,238 --> 00:34:37,364
-I know.
-Dad!

329
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:41,325
-Ehh.
-If you see anyone come out
screaming, it's just me.

330
00:34:41,451 --> 00:34:45,329
-Maybe you should stay here
and watch him.
-Yes, now you're talking.

331
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:52,376
-You want the shotgun?
-No, I prefer the Thompson.

332
00:34:58,383 --> 00:35:01,010
If I were to say to you,

333
00:35:01,135 --> 00:35:05,346
I'm a stranger
traveling from the east,
seeking that which is lost-

334
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,223
Then I would reply
that I am a stranger
traveling from the west.

335
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,893
It is I whom you seek.
How-
Then it is true.

336
00:35:11,018 --> 00:35:13,061
You have the sacred mark.

337
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:16,564
What, that?
No, that got slapped on me
in an orphanage in Cairo.

338
00:35:16,732 --> 00:35:19,150
That mark means
you're a protector of man,

339
00:35:19,276 --> 00:35:21,694
a warrior for God,
a Medjai.

340
00:35:21,778 --> 00:35:24,154
Sorry.
You've got the wrong guy.

341
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:11,195
Mr. Hafez.

342
00:36:15,866 --> 00:36:17,742
They found him.

343
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,784
Imhotep.

344
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,026
Do not be frightened.

345
00:38:32,151 --> 00:38:34,027
I am not afraid.

346
00:39:02,595 --> 00:39:06,681
You know,
a couple of years ago...

347
00:39:06,765 --> 00:39:09,850
this would've seemed
really strange to me.

348
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,565
Lord Imhotep
will be much pleased.

349
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:29,033
Where is it?

350
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,368
Where
is the bracelet?

351
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,788
I think I know.

352
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:38,875
At the very top
of the gold pyramid,
there was a huge diamond.

353
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,877
Huge?
How huge?

354
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:45,881
It was so big,
it would reflect the sun
and wink at distant travelers,

355
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,926
beckoning them
to their deaths.

356
00:40:09,027 --> 00:40:11,278
Get-No! Get off!

357
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:16,492
Oh, my God.

358
00:40:17,868 --> 00:40:21,620
You wait! I'll put you
in your grave again!

359
00:40:21,746 --> 00:40:24,831
Our thinking was,
not if we put you
in your grave first.

360
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:27,835
Burn her!

361
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,420
You bast-

362
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:35,006
Rick!

363
00:40:42,014 --> 00:40:45,975
Open it! Open it!
I'm trying, I'm trying!

364
00:40:48,645 --> 00:40:50,563
Meela!

365
00:41:05,909 --> 00:41:09,703
-Hurry up!
-Come on, come on, come on!

366
00:41:09,747 --> 00:41:12,791
Aah!
You broke it, you broke it,
you broke it!

367
00:41:12,874 --> 00:41:15,834
Be quiet, Alex!
If there's gonna be hysterics,
they'll come from me!

368
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:01,541
Go, go, go, go!

369
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:20,182
Oh, no.
Not these guys again.

370
00:42:28,857 --> 00:42:31,734
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

371
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,737
You're asking me?
I'm only eight years old!

372
00:42:42,536 --> 00:42:45,788
Honey, what you doin'?
These guys don't use doors.

373
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,917
Where the hell's Jonathan?

374
00:42:55,714 --> 00:42:58,090
Alex!
What's the matter
with my car?

375
00:42:58,132 --> 00:43:00,925
I was forced to find
an alternative means
of transportation.

376
00:43:01,051 --> 00:43:03,052
-A double-decker bus?
-It was his idea!

377
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,387
Was not!
Was too!

378
00:43:04,471 --> 00:43:06,639
Just go!
It was too!
Was not!

379
00:43:06,723 --> 00:43:08,599
Oh, jeez.

380
00:43:22,153 --> 00:43:24,738
No, no!
Not my car!

381
00:43:28,951 --> 00:43:31,286
Oh, I hate mummies.

382
00:43:31,328 --> 00:43:34,747
Glad to see me now?
Just like old times,
huh?

383
00:43:53,388 --> 00:43:55,598
Right.

384
00:44:31,505 --> 00:44:33,673
Aah!

385
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,024
Ohh! Ohh!

386
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:16,586
-Aah!
-Turn! Turn! Turn!
Turn! Turn!

387
00:45:19,546 --> 00:45:21,255
Aaah!

388
00:45:22,341 --> 00:45:24,217
Yaah!

389
00:45:34,185 --> 00:45:37,520
-No! Get out of the way!

390
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,963
Look out!

391
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,476
Ugh!

392
00:46:26,563 --> 00:46:28,064
Uh-oh.

393
00:46:35,697 --> 00:46:37,239
Whoa!

394
00:47:09,642 --> 00:47:11,518
Great driving, Uncle Jon.

395
00:47:11,644 --> 00:47:13,353
Yeah.

396
00:47:17,942 --> 00:47:20,443
You all right?

397
00:47:20,569 --> 00:47:24,447
This was... my first bus ride.

398
00:47:26,532 --> 00:47:28,450
Huh?

399
00:47:31,078 --> 00:47:32,996
What would I do
without you?

400
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:36,790
Are all librarians
this much trouble?
Oh, jeez, get a room.

401
00:47:50,094 --> 00:47:52,053
-Let me go!
-Alex!

402
00:47:52,179 --> 00:47:53,638
Silence!
Stop!

403
00:47:53,722 --> 00:47:56,807
-Go!
-Stop!

404
00:48:28,335 --> 00:48:30,753
Alex.

405
00:49:40,899 --> 00:49:43,776
Please, do not fear
for your son, my friends.

406
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:46,778
They cannot hurt him,
for he wears
the bracelet of Anubis.

407
00:49:47,947 --> 00:49:49,781
Alex is wearing
the bracelet?

408
00:49:49,906 --> 00:49:53,075
When he put it on, he said
he saw the pyramids at Giza,
the temple at Karnak.

409
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:56,328
And when they reach Karnak,
the bracelet will show him
the next step of the journey.

410
00:49:56,496 --> 00:49:59,331
Well, if we don't get
to Karnak before them,

411
00:49:59,457 --> 00:50:02,334
we won't have any idea
where to look for him next.

412
00:50:02,459 --> 00:50:06,295
Seems to me like we need
a magic carpet.

413
00:50:24,937 --> 00:50:27,814
When Lord Imhotep last
encountered the O'Connells,

414
00:50:27,982 --> 00:50:30,817
they sent his immortal soul
to the Underworld.

415
00:50:30,942 --> 00:50:32,860
As powerful
as he will become,

416
00:50:32,944 --> 00:50:34,820
he is still vulnerable.

417
00:50:34,945 --> 00:50:38,614
Only with the army of Anubis
will he be invincible.

418
00:50:38,699 --> 00:50:41,617
He will need your help.

419
00:50:43,703 --> 00:50:47,455
Keep this with you always.

420
00:50:47,539 --> 00:50:49,457
Hey!

421
00:50:49,542 --> 00:50:52,502
The Book of the Dead!

422
00:50:52,586 --> 00:50:54,504
What a bright little child.

423
00:50:55,713 --> 00:50:58,048
Your mother must be
missing you terribly.

424
00:50:58,174 --> 00:51:01,051
If you wish
to see her again,
you'd better behave.

425
00:51:01,177 --> 00:51:03,512
Lady, I don't behave
for my parents.

426
00:51:03,595 --> 00:51:06,805
What makes you think
I'm going to do it for you?
Silence!

427
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:11,310
Because your parents
wouldn't slip poisonous snakes
into your bed...

428
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:13,646
while you were sleeping.

429
00:51:13,729 --> 00:51:16,564
Lord Imhotep
wishes to meet the boy.

430
00:51:16,648 --> 00:51:19,525
Now we shall see
how brave you are.

431
00:51:19,651 --> 00:51:21,861
Hey!

432
00:51:21,987 --> 00:51:24,697
Watch the suit!
Hey!

433
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:26,574
Ow! Me fingers!

434
00:51:27,783 --> 00:51:29,742
Nice.

435
00:51:31,995 --> 00:51:34,163
Very nice.

436
00:51:34,247 --> 00:51:36,248
Did you acquire
what we asked?

437
00:51:36,374 --> 00:51:38,750
Oh, we acquired it,
all right.

438
00:51:38,876 --> 00:51:40,752
You know what?

439
00:51:40,877 --> 00:51:44,629
We had to kill two of
those guards at the mausoleum...
to acquire it.

440
00:51:44,715 --> 00:51:47,342
This chest is cursed.

441
00:51:48,426 --> 00:51:50,344
It says there is one,

442
00:51:50,427 --> 00:51:52,345
the undead,

443
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:55,098
who will kill all those
who open this chest.

444
00:51:55,224 --> 00:51:58,768
Yes, yes, and the creature
will suck them dry,
then become whole again.

445
00:51:58,893 --> 00:52:00,769
We've all heard
this story before.

446
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:04,481
Yeah, but I heard
the yanks who found it
nine years ago all died.

447
00:52:04,565 --> 00:52:06,483
Horrible deaths,
they were.

448
00:52:06,609 --> 00:52:09,110
-So, with that in mind-
-We want ten.

449
00:52:09,236 --> 00:52:11,237
-Quiet!

450
00:52:14,074 --> 00:52:15,950
The agreement was for five.

451
00:52:16,117 --> 00:52:18,952
Yeah, well, we want ten,
or we'll take it elsewhere.

452
00:52:19,078 --> 00:52:21,079
If you-
Ten will be just fine.

453
00:52:21,246 --> 00:52:23,080
Follow me, gentlemen.

454
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:26,251
Get in.

455
00:52:48,812 --> 00:52:50,771
it is you
who are the chosen one,

456
00:52:50,897 --> 00:52:54,775
you who will take me
to Ahm Shere.

457
00:52:54,858 --> 00:52:58,986
What if I don't?
What if I get
a little... Lost?

458
00:53:01,156 --> 00:53:03,824
You have strength,
little one.

459
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:06,285
You are
your father's son.

460
00:53:06,411 --> 00:53:08,912
But I know something
you don't.

461
00:53:09,038 --> 00:53:13,166
This bracelet is a gift
and a curse.

462
00:53:14,709 --> 00:53:17,127
The sands of time...

463
00:53:17,212 --> 00:53:19,839
have already begun
to pour against you.

464
00:53:23,425 --> 00:53:26,010
Yeah, yeah.
I already heard this part.

465
00:53:26,177 --> 00:53:28,178
From the minute
I put the bracelet on,

466
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:30,806
seven days do I have
before the Scorpion King
wakes up.

467
00:53:30,932 --> 00:53:33,433
Did you also hear
that if you do not
enter the pyramid...

468
00:53:33,517 --> 00:53:36,435
before the sun strikes it
on that very morning...

469
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:39,437
that the bracelet will
suck the life out of you?

470
00:53:39,523 --> 00:53:41,441
That part I missed.

471
00:53:41,566 --> 00:53:44,610
Hey, wait a minute.
That means I've only got
five days left.

472
00:53:44,735 --> 00:53:48,988
Then I believe it will be best
if we do not get lost.
Don't you?

473
00:53:49,073 --> 00:53:52,867
My dad is going
to kick your ass.

474
00:53:53,034 --> 00:53:54,868
Mmm.

475
00:53:58,664 --> 00:54:01,791
-I do not think so.

476
00:54:06,337 --> 00:54:08,213
In here, gentlemen,

477
00:54:08,339 --> 00:54:10,715
you shall receive
your just rewards.

478
00:54:10,842 --> 00:54:12,718
No tricks now, woman.

479
00:54:12,843 --> 00:54:15,720
We're not givin' up this chest
till we're satisfied.

480
00:54:15,846 --> 00:54:19,223
Oh, don't worry.
There is much satisfaction
to be had.

481
00:54:26,105 --> 00:54:29,482
-What's going on?

482
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:37,822
This place... is cursed.

483
00:54:37,948 --> 00:54:41,867
-What is it
with you and curses?
-He ain't happy without a curse.

484
00:54:41,952 --> 00:54:45,496
This is cursed.
That is cursed.
Give it a rest, will ya!

485
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:51,208
Christ!

486
00:54:58,883 --> 00:55:02,344
He wants you to open the chest!
Open the chest!

487
00:55:03,471 --> 00:55:06,014
-No!

488
00:55:25,615 --> 00:55:27,533
Where'd he go?

489
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:29,534
Where'd he go?

490
00:55:48,593 --> 00:55:50,469
Spivey!

491
00:56:18,202 --> 00:56:21,746
This is the magic carpet?
He'll be fine.
He's a professional.

492
00:56:24,457 --> 00:56:26,667
-Izzy!
-Aah!

493
00:56:29,504 --> 00:56:31,505
Hey!

494
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:34,507
He definitely
remembers you.
He's a little shy.

495
00:56:34,633 --> 00:56:36,509
Jonathan, get our bags.

496
00:56:36,634 --> 00:56:38,510
Oh, my hands are full.
Now.

497
00:56:38,637 --> 00:56:41,472
Right. I'll get the bags.
I'll deal with
the flight details.

498
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:46,434
Honey, you're not
a subtle man.
We don't have time for subtle.

499
00:56:49,521 --> 00:56:51,230
Izzy, come here.
Oh, no, no.

500
00:56:52,857 --> 00:56:55,358
Doesn't look happy
to see you.
Never turned me down yet.

501
00:56:55,484 --> 00:56:57,485
Whatever it is,
whatever you need,
I don't care.

502
00:56:57,611 --> 00:57:00,488
Forget it, O'Connell.
Every time I hook up with you,
I get shot!

503
00:57:00,614 --> 00:57:04,075
Last time,
I got shot in the ass.
I'm in mourning for my ass.

504
00:57:04,158 --> 00:57:07,327
Remember that bank job
in Marrakesh?
Bank job?

505
00:57:07,453 --> 00:57:10,455
It's not like it sounds.
Uh, it's exactly
how it sounds.

506
00:57:10,539 --> 00:57:13,207
I'm flying high,
hiding in the sun.

507
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:16,293
The white boy here
flags me down, so I fly in
low for the pickup.

508
00:57:16,377 --> 00:57:18,545
The next thing you know,
I get shot!

509
00:57:18,671 --> 00:57:20,714
I'm lying in
the middle of the road
with my spleen hanging out,

510
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,216
and I see him waltzing up
with some belly dancer girl.

511
00:57:23,342 --> 00:57:27,178
Belly dancer girl?
Izzy, I think
you and I should talk.

512
00:57:27,303 --> 00:57:29,304
As long as I don't get shot.
Quit your whining.

513
00:57:29,388 --> 00:57:31,514
You're gonna get paid
this time.

514
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:36,186
O'Connell, have you looked
around here any? Huh?

515
00:57:36,311 --> 00:57:39,730
What do I need money for?
What the hell
am I gonna spend it on?

516
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:42,399
I'm gonna keep this short.
My little boy is out there.

517
00:57:42,526 --> 00:57:44,777
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to get him back.

518
00:57:52,576 --> 00:57:54,494
O'Connell, if you give me
that gold stick there,

519
00:57:54,577 --> 00:57:56,787
you can shave my head,
wax my legs
and use me for a surfboard.

520
00:57:58,039 --> 00:58:00,540
Didn't we do that
in Tripoli?

521
00:58:00,666 --> 00:58:03,751
Say, by the way,
when did you... lose your eye?

522
00:58:03,877 --> 00:58:06,337
Oh. I didn't.

523
00:58:06,421 --> 00:58:08,339
I just thought it made me
look more dashing.

524
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:12,175
Come on.
Get to work.

525
00:58:13,426 --> 00:58:15,344
You're not exactly
catching me at my best.

526
00:58:15,429 --> 00:58:18,222
Oh, I'm sure I am.

527
00:58:24,854 --> 00:58:27,814
I knew it.
I'm gonna get shot.

528
00:58:29,899 --> 00:58:33,443
These are the commanders
of the 12 tribes
of the Medjai. Horus!

529
00:58:39,741 --> 00:58:43,118
-Ah. Pet bird.
-My best
and most clever friend.

530
00:58:43,244 --> 00:58:46,121
He will let the commanders
know of our progress
so that they may follow.

531
00:59:04,262 --> 00:59:06,555
If the Army of Anubis arises,

532
00:59:07,975 --> 00:59:11,019
they will do all they can
to stop it.

533
00:59:11,102 --> 00:59:13,061
Rick, are you sure
Izzy's reliable?

534
00:59:13,104 --> 00:59:15,397
Yeah, yeah,
he's reliable-ish.

535
00:59:20,735 --> 00:59:23,445
-Isn't she beautiful?
-It's a balloon.

536
00:59:23,571 --> 00:59:26,740
-Oh! It's a dirigible.
-Where's your airplane?

537
00:59:26,824 --> 00:59:29,325
-Airplanes are
a thing of the past.
-Izzy, you were right.

538
00:59:29,452 --> 00:59:31,787
-I was?
-Yeah. You're gonna get shot.

539
00:59:31,912 --> 00:59:35,623
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
She's faster than she looks.

540
00:59:35,748 --> 00:59:38,375
And she's quiet.
Real quiet.

541
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,545
Perfect for sneaking up
on people, which is
a very good thing.

542
00:59:41,629 --> 00:59:43,547
Unless, of course,
we go with your approach-

543
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:47,091
barging in face-first,
guns blazing, and gettin'
your friends shot in the ass!

544
00:59:49,469 --> 00:59:53,972
Why can't you people ever
keep your feet on the ground?

545
01:00:39,512 --> 01:00:43,390
O'Connell does not want
to believe, but he flies
like Horus towards his destiny.

546
01:00:43,516 --> 01:00:47,352
Yes, yes, very interesting.
Tell me some more
about this gold pyramid.

547
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:50,104
Well, it is written
that since the time
of the Scorpion King,

548
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:53,440
no man who has laid eyes
upon it has ever returned
to tell the tale.

549
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:55,901
Where is all
this stuff written?
Hello.

550
01:00:58,195 --> 01:01:00,446
Got it.

551
01:01:01,656 --> 01:01:03,866
Mmm-hmm-hmm.

552
01:01:03,992 --> 01:01:06,535
Pretty nice, eh?

553
01:01:06,661 --> 01:01:08,912
This is all I have left
in the world.

554
01:01:09,038 --> 01:01:11,206
The rest of my fortune
was lost...

555
01:01:11,289 --> 01:01:13,582
to some rather unscrupulous
characters, actually.

556
01:01:13,709 --> 01:01:17,837
But if the curator reacted
to it the way you say,
it must be very important.

557
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,879
If I were you,
I would keep it close.

558
01:01:20,005 --> 01:01:23,466
My friend, the gods couldn't
take this away from me.
Hey!

559
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:26,427
-That's mine!
-No, it's not!

560
01:01:26,553 --> 01:01:28,804
Keep your hands off fit.

561
01:01:37,479 --> 01:01:39,522
Hey.

562
01:01:39,564 --> 01:01:42,149
I want him back, Rick.

563
01:01:42,233 --> 01:01:44,151
I want him in my arms.

564
01:01:44,235 --> 01:01:46,153
I know.

565
01:01:47,905 --> 01:01:49,781
We taught him well.

566
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:53,700
He's smarter than you...

567
01:01:53,785 --> 01:01:55,703
and he's tougher than me.

568
01:01:55,786 --> 01:01:57,704
I love him so much.
I just can't-

569
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:00,165
I know. We both do,
and Alex knows that.

570
01:02:02,376 --> 01:02:04,252
I'll get him back, Evy.
I promise.

571
01:02:04,419 --> 01:02:06,253
I know you will.

572
01:02:32,902 --> 01:02:35,779
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?
No. No.

573
01:02:35,863 --> 01:02:38,907
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?
No. No.

574
01:02:38,991 --> 01:02:41,034
No. No.
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

575
01:02:41,118 --> 01:02:43,745
No. No.
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

576
01:02:43,828 --> 01:02:46,038
No! No! No!
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

577
01:02:46,163 --> 01:02:49,207
-Whoa! That was amazing!

578
01:02:49,292 --> 01:02:52,919
Perfect aim.
What are you talking about?

579
01:02:53,045 --> 01:02:54,963
I missed.

580
01:03:03,512 --> 01:03:05,471
I have to go
to the bathroom.

581
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:16,273
Ugh.

582
01:03:35,707 --> 01:03:37,666
Make it quick.

583
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:39,709
Ugh.

584
01:03:45,173 --> 01:03:47,216
Hurry up.

585
01:03:50,177 --> 01:03:52,387
-Hey, reading material.
-Now!

586
01:03:56,767 --> 01:03:59,519
I can't go
when someone's watching.

587
01:04:02,229 --> 01:04:04,147
I don't trust you.
You'll look.

588
01:04:14,032 --> 01:04:15,908
Darn!

589
01:04:19,328 --> 01:04:23,914
Oh, my God!
Doesn't anyone around here
know how to flush a toilet?

590
01:05:23,592 --> 01:05:25,510
Karnak.

591
01:05:37,937 --> 01:05:39,813
Huh?

592
01:05:57,288 --> 01:05:59,164
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

593
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:09,506
If a man does not
embrace his past,
he has no future.

594
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:13,300
Look, even if...

595
01:06:13,385 --> 01:06:15,303
I was some sort
of sacred Medjai,

596
01:06:15,387 --> 01:06:17,430
what good
does that do me now?

597
01:06:17,514 --> 01:06:19,598
It is the missing piece
of your heart.

598
01:06:19,765 --> 01:06:23,351
If you embrace it,
if you accept it,
you can do anything.

599
01:06:23,478 --> 01:06:26,188
Sounds great.
Listen.

600
01:06:26,355 --> 01:06:30,024
-What can we expect from
our old friend Imhotep?
-His powers are returning.

601
01:06:30,149 --> 01:06:32,525
By the time
he reaches Ahm Shere,

602
01:06:32,694 --> 01:06:35,571
even the Scorpion King
won't be able to stop him.

603
01:10:55,505 --> 01:10:58,840
Anck-su-namun!

604
01:11:10,101 --> 01:11:12,102
Imhotep!

605
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,282
Evy!

606
01:11:51,179 --> 01:11:53,097
Imhotep!

607
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:27,585
Imhotep.
Anck-su-namun.

608
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:38,385
Evy, I know you haven't exactly
been your self lately with
all these dreams and visions-

609
01:12:38,511 --> 01:12:41,346
No, no, they're memories
from my previous life.

610
01:12:41,472 --> 01:12:44,349
Honestly,
I'm not losing my mind.
It all makes perfect sense now.

611
01:12:44,433 --> 01:12:47,477
And that's the reason why
we found the bracelet?
Exactly.

612
01:12:47,602 --> 01:12:49,937
I was its protector.
Now do you believe, my friend?

613
01:12:50,021 --> 01:12:52,397
Clearly, you were destined
to protect this woman.

614
01:12:52,523 --> 01:12:55,650
Right.
She's a reincarnated princess,
and I'm a warrior for God.

615
01:12:55,776 --> 01:12:59,779
And your son leads the way
to Ahm Shere.
Three sides of the pyramid.

616
01:12:59,863 --> 01:13:04,408
This was all preordained
thousands of years ago.
And how does the story end?

617
01:13:04,534 --> 01:13:07,161
Only the journey's written,
not the destination.

618
01:13:07,286 --> 01:13:10,496
-Convenient.
-How else do you explain
Evy's visions?

619
01:13:10,581 --> 01:13:13,041
That it is your son
who wears the bracelet?

620
01:13:13,124 --> 01:13:16,751
-How do you explain your mark?
-Coincidence.

621
01:13:16,878 --> 01:13:21,631
My friend,
there is a fine line
between coincidence and fate.

622
01:13:40,232 --> 01:13:42,567
Don't even think about it!

623
01:13:46,571 --> 01:13:49,198
Hold on there, partner.

624
01:13:52,075 --> 01:13:54,368
When the time comes,

625
01:13:54,452 --> 01:13:58,163
I shall truly enjoy
killing you.

626
01:13:58,247 --> 01:14:01,791
But until that time,

627
01:14:01,917 --> 01:14:04,794
you better be
a little nicer to me.

628
01:14:04,919 --> 01:14:06,878
Now, where's my water?

629
01:14:09,257 --> 01:14:12,050
No ice?

630
01:14:17,473 --> 01:14:19,391
Make sure
he doesn't move!

631
01:14:49,792 --> 01:14:52,043
They've gone.
We've lost them.

632
01:15:07,766 --> 01:15:09,642
Rick!

633
01:15:18,066 --> 01:15:20,859
Alex left us his tie,

634
01:15:20,986 --> 01:15:24,905
and he made us
a little sand castle.

635
01:15:24,989 --> 01:15:27,324
It's the Temple Island
of Philae.

636
01:15:27,408 --> 01:15:29,326
They've gone to Philae.
That-a-boy, Alex.

637
01:15:29,451 --> 01:15:31,327
Come on!

638
01:15:42,003 --> 01:15:44,755
The great temple
of Abu Simbel.

639
01:17:11,874 --> 01:17:14,375
That's the Blue Nile
down there.

640
01:17:14,459 --> 01:17:16,377
We must be
out of Egypt by now.

641
01:17:16,461 --> 01:17:19,880
In ancient times,
all this still belonged
to the upper kingdom.

642
01:17:19,964 --> 01:17:22,174
The oasis must be
around here somewhere.

643
01:17:22,258 --> 01:17:25,051
Don't worry, Evy,
we'll find him.
He's a smart kid.

644
01:17:25,135 --> 01:17:27,053
He'll leave us a sign.

645
01:17:32,308 --> 01:17:34,226
Surprised to see me?
Aah!

646
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:37,270
Leaving bread crumbs, huh?
Huh?

647
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:32,901
We're in trouble!

648
01:18:32,986 --> 01:18:35,070
Whoa!

649
01:18:45,914 --> 01:18:48,124
Horus, fly!

650
01:18:50,709 --> 01:18:54,378
Izzy, come hard right!
Starboard! Starboard!

651
01:19:37,542 --> 01:19:40,252
Was there a little something
you forgot to mention? Hmm?

652
01:19:44,005 --> 01:19:46,173
Uh, people?

653
01:20:04,398 --> 01:20:07,275
Ahm Shere.

654
01:20:17,451 --> 01:20:20,036
-Right.

655
01:20:25,583 --> 01:20:27,542
-He's back!

656
01:20:29,754 --> 01:20:31,964
Hang on!

657
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:47,226
Well, that's not good.

658
01:20:49,355 --> 01:20:51,273
Hang on!

659
01:20:57,653 --> 01:21:00,071
Mom?

660
01:21:00,156 --> 01:21:02,074
Dad?

661
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:13,000
We're gonna go get my son.

662
01:21:13,125 --> 01:21:15,960
Then we're gonna wanna
get out of here fast,
so make this work, Izzy.

663
01:21:16,044 --> 01:21:17,962
No, no, you don't understand,
goddamn it.

664
01:21:18,045 --> 01:21:20,421
This thing was filled with gas.
Not hot air-gas.

665
01:21:20,506 --> 01:21:22,424
I need gas to get
this thing off the ground.

666
01:21:22,508 --> 01:21:24,426
Where am I gonna get gas
from around here? Huh?

667
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:26,636
Bananas? Mangos?
Tarzan's ass?

668
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,971
Well, maybe I could finagle it
to take hot air.

669
01:21:29,055 --> 01:21:32,265
But do you know how many
cubic meters I'd need?
It's too big!

670
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:37,187
If anybody can fill
this thing up with hot air,
Izzy, it's you.

671
01:21:43,693 --> 01:21:48,363
Come to Daddy.

672
01:21:48,489 --> 01:21:50,365
Horus!

673
01:21:58,372 --> 01:22:00,957
So, Rick,
what's the plan?

674
01:22:01,041 --> 01:22:03,542
Let's find some higher ground.

675
01:22:21,726 --> 01:22:23,602
Horus!

676
01:22:29,024 --> 01:22:30,900
I must go.
Where?

677
01:22:31,026 --> 01:22:33,319
I must let the commanders know
where we are.
You can't go.

678
01:22:33,402 --> 01:22:36,362
If the Army of Anubis arises-
I need you to help me
find my son.

679
01:22:42,577 --> 01:22:45,078
Then first,
I shall help you.
Thank you.

680
01:23:23,905 --> 01:23:26,240
Look.
Roman legionnaires.

681
01:23:28,326 --> 01:23:33,705
And here.
Turn-of-the-century French.
Napoleon's troops.

682
01:23:33,788 --> 01:23:36,915
What in the name
of Anubis did this?

683
01:23:56,516 --> 01:23:59,518
You hear that?
What?

684
01:23:59,644 --> 01:24:01,687
Nothing.

685
01:24:01,813 --> 01:24:04,106
Absolutely nothing.

686
01:24:04,190 --> 01:24:07,442
My word!

687
01:24:10,654 --> 01:24:12,989
I say, chaps, look at this.

688
01:24:13,115 --> 01:24:16,826
Shrunken heads.
I'd love to know
how they do that.

689
01:24:18,994 --> 01:24:21,037
Just curious.

690
01:24:26,209 --> 01:24:28,669
You any good
with that?

691
01:24:28,794 --> 01:24:32,129
Three times Fox and Hound's
grand champion,
I'll have you know.

692
01:24:32,215 --> 01:24:35,967
You any good with that?
You'll know soon enough.

693
01:24:36,051 --> 01:24:40,179
Because the only way
to kill an Anubis warrior
is by taking off its head.

694
01:24:40,304 --> 01:24:42,180
I'll remember that.

695
01:24:47,686 --> 01:24:50,104
Evy, try to remember to, uh-

696
01:24:52,148 --> 01:24:54,775
Just keep it tight
in the shoulder and, uh,

697
01:24:56,652 --> 01:25:00,446
Lead the target a little bit,
and then, uh-

698
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:02,948
And squeeze the trigger.
Don't pull it.

699
01:25:04,993 --> 01:25:06,869
I won't miss.

700
01:25:46,029 --> 01:25:48,572
-Pyramid.
-The pyramid.

701
01:25:48,698 --> 01:25:51,158
Cripes, I'm in trouble now.

702
01:25:51,241 --> 01:25:53,075
Now may I kill him?

703
01:26:06,295 --> 01:26:08,213
Retrieve that bracelet.
With pleasure.

704
01:26:35,071 --> 01:26:38,031
Something is coming.

705
01:26:57,590 --> 01:27:00,675
Jonathan?
Yes?

706
01:27:00,802 --> 01:27:03,762
That's my husband
and my son down there.

707
01:27:03,846 --> 01:27:06,264
Make me proud.

708
01:27:06,348 --> 01:27:08,266
Today's that day, Evy.

709
01:27:15,064 --> 01:27:17,274
Where's the boy?

710
01:28:36,343 --> 01:28:38,678
The Black Book!

711
01:28:43,307 --> 01:28:44,849
Let's go!

712
01:29:14,501 --> 01:29:17,044
There you are!

713
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:20,423
The time has come,
my little friend.

714
01:29:20,548 --> 01:29:22,674
Let go!

715
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:43,066
-Dad!
-Alex!

716
01:29:43,193 --> 01:29:45,528
Alex-

717
01:29:51,825 --> 01:29:53,784
Dad!

718
01:30:03,043 --> 01:30:05,920
Time to remove that
bracelet, my good son.

719
01:30:06,004 --> 01:30:08,589
-Dad!

720
01:30:16,596 --> 01:30:19,056
-Dad, behind you!
-Whoa!

721
01:31:41,754 --> 01:31:44,339
Let's go.
Thank God for that.

722
01:31:51,762 --> 01:31:55,389
The two of you must
sacrifice yourselves for me.

723
01:31:56,726 --> 01:31:59,561
You shall be rewarded
in heaven!

724
01:32:14,115 --> 01:32:16,658
Mom!
Alex!

725
01:32:16,784 --> 01:32:19,702
Hey, nice shootin', Tex.
What were those creepy
little pygmy things?

726
01:32:19,787 --> 01:32:21,705
Just the local natives.
Are you sure?

727
01:32:21,789 --> 01:32:23,582
I'm sure.
It was nothin'.

728
01:32:23,707 --> 01:32:25,750
Come on, Mom!
Come on! Come on, Dad!

729
01:32:25,875 --> 01:32:29,044
We have to get to the pyramid.
I have to get
the bracelet off now!

730
01:32:29,129 --> 01:32:31,088
Oh, leave it on, Alex.
Looks good on you.

731
01:32:31,214 --> 01:32:33,924
No, you guys!
You don't understand!
He told me...

732
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:38,093
the bracelet will kill me if
I don't get inside the pyramid
before the sun hits it!

733
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:41,179
-Today!
-Oh, my God.

734
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:46,852
Time to go!

735
01:32:46,935 --> 01:32:48,853
I thought you said
it was nothing!

736
01:33:00,948 --> 01:33:03,366
Where's Jonathan?

737
01:33:13,417 --> 01:33:15,251
Look!
There's a burial ground!

738
01:33:15,377 --> 01:33:18,712
We're safe! We're safe!
See those sacred stones?
They'll never cross those.

739
01:33:18,796 --> 01:33:21,923
You are sure?
Yes, of course I'm sure!

740
01:33:36,895 --> 01:33:39,480
Sorry.
My mistake.

741
01:33:47,488 --> 01:33:50,156
Wait for me!
Hurry up, Jonathan!

742
01:33:51,574 --> 01:33:54,075
Wait for me!
What's that for?

743
01:33:54,203 --> 01:33:56,663
Ah, nothin'.
Just a little something
in case of an emergency.

744
01:34:14,512 --> 01:34:16,513
Rick.

745
01:34:19,349 --> 01:34:21,267
Let's go, Alex!

746
01:34:29,858 --> 01:34:33,277
Run!
Come on, Alex, faster!
Come on!

747
01:34:33,361 --> 01:34:37,530
Come on!
Dad! The bracelet!

748
01:34:37,657 --> 01:34:39,950
Run! Come on!

749
01:35:02,553 --> 01:35:05,638
You know, it's not...

750
01:35:05,764 --> 01:35:08,891
easy being a... dad.

751
01:35:09,017 --> 01:35:12,019
Yeah, but you do it
really good.

752
01:35:12,145 --> 01:35:14,021
Thanks.

753
01:35:32,913 --> 01:35:35,915
They made it.
Thank God.

754
01:35:35,999 --> 01:35:39,043
Oh, yes.
Great.

755
01:35:39,169 --> 01:35:41,045
Fabulous.

756
01:35:44,506 --> 01:35:46,090
No!

757
01:35:57,225 --> 01:35:59,059
Evy!

758
01:35:59,144 --> 01:36:01,687
Evy!

759
01:36:06,650 --> 01:36:10,027
Jonathan!
Jonathan!
Mom!

760
01:36:10,111 --> 01:36:12,612
-You're going to be all right.
Isn't she, Dad?
-She'll be fine.

761
01:36:12,739 --> 01:36:14,782
She's going to be all right.
Just get him-
Take him. Take-

762
01:36:14,908 --> 01:36:18,035
Mommy's fine.
It's okay.

763
01:36:18,119 --> 01:36:20,245
Where-Evy-
Your mother's
gonna be fine, okay?

764
01:36:20,329 --> 01:36:22,455
Oh, my God!

765
01:36:22,581 --> 01:36:25,249
You're real strong.
You're gonna make it.
You're gonna make it.

766
01:36:25,375 --> 01:36:27,710
You're fine.

767
01:36:27,794 --> 01:36:31,755
What do I do?
What do I do, Evy?

768
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:35,758
What do I do?
Take care of Alex.

769
01:36:37,010 --> 01:36:40,762
No.
Sweetheart, no.

770
01:36:43,433 --> 01:36:45,893
I love you.

771
01:36:46,018 --> 01:36:49,479
No, don't-No.
No!

772
01:36:49,604 --> 01:36:51,897
Evy? Evy?

773
01:36:53,567 --> 01:36:57,570
No. No.
Evy!

774
01:37:02,115 --> 01:37:03,991
Come back, Evy.

775
01:37:05,577 --> 01:37:08,704
Evy, come back.

776
01:37:08,829 --> 01:37:10,705
Come back.

777
01:38:35,696 --> 01:38:37,572
Stay here.

778
01:39:28,367 --> 01:39:30,243
Whoa!

779
01:40:11,863 --> 01:40:14,490
Try to think of it
like this, Alex.

780
01:40:14,616 --> 01:40:16,992
She's gone to a better place.

781
01:40:17,118 --> 01:40:19,077
You know, like it says
in the good book.

782
01:40:19,161 --> 01:40:21,621
The book.
That's it.
What?

783
01:40:21,747 --> 01:40:24,374
That's it.
Come on, Uncle Jon!
That's what?

784
01:40:24,499 --> 01:40:26,500
Come on! Come on!
That's it! The book!
What?

785
01:40:35,843 --> 01:40:39,971
You're too late, O'Connell.
I have released
the Army of Anubis.

786
01:40:40,096 --> 01:40:45,475
Lord Imhotep shall soon
kill the Scorpion King
and take command.

787
01:40:45,601 --> 01:40:47,477
Not after
I get through with him.

788
01:40:47,603 --> 01:40:49,521
Aah!

789
01:41:16,711 --> 01:41:19,004
Niy!

790
01:41:26,136 --> 01:41:28,637
Niy!
Niy!

791
01:41:28,722 --> 01:41:30,806
You realize, of course,

792
01:41:30,932 --> 01:41:34,226
that this can only be done
by someone who can actually
read ancient Egyptian.

793
01:41:34,352 --> 01:41:37,479
I don't know about you,
but I'm a tad rusty.

794
01:41:37,562 --> 01:41:39,480
Now where?

795
01:41:39,565 --> 01:41:43,401
We go right.
How do you know?

796
01:41:43,526 --> 01:41:45,485
"Kasheesh Osirian Nye. "

797
01:41:45,570 --> 01:41:48,989
Basically,
"This way to the Scorpion King."

798
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:52,576
Mum taught me.

799
01:41:55,578 --> 01:41:58,246
This just might work.

800
01:42:28,482 --> 01:42:30,692
It's time someone taught you
a lesson, wench.
Come on.

801
01:42:40,117 --> 01:42:42,076
This is for my sister.

802
01:44:30,505 --> 01:44:33,340
Is that all you've got?

803
01:45:23,926 --> 01:45:26,386
Hurry up, Alex!

804
01:45:26,512 --> 01:45:31,557
"Hootashnaraba
oos Veesloo.

805
01:45:31,682 --> 01:45:34,684
Ahm kum Ra.
Ahm kum Dei. "

806
01:46:17,389 --> 01:46:20,850
"EfdayShokran-
EfdayShokran-"

807
01:46:20,934 --> 01:46:23,769
Uncle Jon, I don't know
what this last symbol is!

808
01:46:23,894 --> 01:46:27,271
-What's it look like?
-It's a bird! A stork!

809
01:46:29,775 --> 01:46:32,777
I know that one!
I know that one!

810
01:46:32,902 --> 01:46:36,780
-Then what is it?

811
01:46:36,906 --> 01:46:39,574
Ahmenophus!

812
01:46:39,658 --> 01:46:42,910
That's it!
"EfdayShokranAhmenophus!"

813
01:47:23,613 --> 01:47:26,490
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

814
01:47:26,615 --> 01:47:29,784
-Oh, my God. Evy!
-Take Alex.

815
01:47:29,869 --> 01:47:32,662
Go and help Rick.
No "buts," Alex.
But Mom-

816
01:47:32,746 --> 01:47:35,539
-Come on, Alex.
- But-But-

817
01:47:37,333 --> 01:47:39,209
I'll be just fine.

818
01:47:39,335 --> 01:47:41,211
We did it, Uncle Jon!
We did it!

819
01:47:41,337 --> 01:47:43,296
Right, partner.
Now, let's go help your dad.

820
01:49:18,963 --> 01:49:20,964
Nefertiri.

821
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:23,883
Anck-su-namun.

822
01:49:45,903 --> 01:49:47,904
That's a little something new!

823
01:50:16,138 --> 01:50:19,807
My lord!

824
01:50:19,892 --> 01:50:21,810
Save me!
Save me!

825
01:51:47,384 --> 01:51:49,385
Okay, now I'm a believer.

826
01:51:49,511 --> 01:51:52,096
Rick!

827
01:51:53,639 --> 01:51:56,557
-Jonathan!
It's a spear!
-Dad!

828
01:51:56,642 --> 01:51:59,352
The gold stick thing-
It's a-It's a spear!

829
01:51:59,436 --> 01:52:02,438
Really?
Doesn't look like a spear!

830
01:52:02,563 --> 01:52:05,190
No! That's because
it opens up into one!

831
01:52:05,275 --> 01:52:07,860
Yes? And?
Jonathan!

832
01:52:07,985 --> 01:52:10,737
It opens up into spear!

833
01:52:57,237 --> 01:53:00,739
-Rick!
-Evy?

834
01:53:07,578 --> 01:53:10,455
Twist it! Pull!
I tried it!
Push!

835
01:53:13,208 --> 01:53:15,584
Jonathan, quick!

836
01:53:29,348 --> 01:53:32,016
Jonathan, throw it!
Kill the Scorpion King!

837
01:53:32,142 --> 01:53:34,101
Send his army
back to the Underworld!

838
01:53:34,227 --> 01:53:37,104
Step aside, Alex.
I'm a professional.

839
01:53:56,954 --> 01:53:58,830
Rick!

840
01:54:06,254 --> 01:54:09,798
-No!

841
01:54:27,773 --> 01:54:29,399
No!

842
01:54:33,654 --> 01:54:35,530
Niy!

843
01:54:40,742 --> 01:54:44,703
Go to hell,
and take your friends with you!

844
01:56:01,063 --> 01:56:02,939
Dad!

845
01:56:20,455 --> 01:56:23,457
Evy, no!
Get out of here!

846
01:56:23,582 --> 01:56:26,083
Just get out of here!

847
01:56:26,209 --> 01:56:28,252
No!

848
01:56:31,923 --> 01:56:34,091
Mom!

849
01:56:46,101 --> 01:56:48,477
Hang on, Rick!

850
01:56:57,903 --> 01:57:00,321
Anck-su-namun!

851
01:57:04,368 --> 01:57:07,453
-No!
-Anck-su-namun!

852
01:57:11,708 --> 01:57:13,626
Anck-su-namun.

853
01:57:57,330 --> 01:57:59,206
Whoa!

854
01:58:03,376 --> 01:58:05,252
Let's go up!

855
01:58:24,103 --> 01:58:28,064
This whole damn place
is gonna get sucked up!
Let's move up! Go!

856
01:58:41,493 --> 01:58:44,036
Go, Alex!
Come on! Come on!

857
01:58:54,004 --> 01:58:56,964
Rick, we're trapped!

858
01:59:03,095 --> 01:59:05,305
Hey!

859
01:59:08,017 --> 01:59:10,644
-Izzy!
-Come on!
Get your butts moving!

860
01:59:10,769 --> 01:59:13,145
Hurry up! Hurry up!
I haven't got all day!

861
01:59:17,066 --> 01:59:18,942
Go! You're next!

862
01:59:25,573 --> 01:59:28,575
-Jonathan! Hold on!

863
01:59:28,701 --> 01:59:31,786
-Pull him up! Pull him up!
-Pull up! Pull me up!

864
01:59:33,705 --> 01:59:37,624
Wait! Wait!
Let me down! Let me down!

865
01:59:37,708 --> 01:59:41,127
-It's not worth your life,
you idiot!
-Yes, it is! Yes, it is!

866
01:59:43,714 --> 01:59:45,632
Right.

867
01:59:51,138 --> 01:59:55,516
Pull me up!
Pull me up!

868
02:00:10,153 --> 02:00:13,322
-Whoo! Whoo!
-Okay.

869
02:00:13,407 --> 02:00:15,950
Yeah!
O'Connell.

870
02:00:16,034 --> 02:00:18,494
You almost got me killed!
At least
you didn't get shot.

871
02:00:19,620 --> 02:00:22,038
Izzy!
Thank you!

872
02:00:22,165 --> 02:00:25,292
Thank you!
Mmm! Mmm!

873
02:00:25,375 --> 02:00:27,710
Yes!

874
02:00:27,836 --> 02:00:30,212
O'Connell,
who the hell you been
messin' with this time?

875
02:00:30,338 --> 02:00:32,297
Huh?
Oh, you know, the usual.

876
02:00:32,422 --> 02:00:35,507
Mummies, pygmies,

877
02:00:35,634 --> 02:00:38,636
big bugs.

878
02:01:06,453 --> 02:01:09,080
I thought I almost
lost you there.

879
02:01:09,205 --> 02:01:11,081
For a moment there,
you did.

880
02:01:12,624 --> 02:01:15,000
Would you like to know
what heaven looks like?

881
02:01:16,545 --> 02:01:18,421
Later.

882
02:01:21,882 --> 02:01:23,925
Oh, please!

883
02:01:24,051 --> 02:01:26,261
That's half mine,
you know.
What?

884
02:01:26,387 --> 02:01:28,930
That's half mine.
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

885
02:01:29,056 --> 02:01:31,808
What?
You took my gold stick!
I know you took my gold stick!

886
02:01:31,891 --> 02:01:36,185
I swear on the head
of my wife, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

887
02:01:36,271 --> 02:01:38,230
You haven't-
You ain't got a wife!

888
02:01:38,356 --> 02:01:40,732
I don't have
your gold stick either!

889
02:04:21,955 --> 02:04:23,873
Forever.

890
02:04:31,672 --> 02:04:35,216
Forever may not
belong enough

891
02:04:35,342 --> 02:04:37,426
For my love

892
02:04:40,472 --> 02:04:43,724
I have a will
but I'm lost inside

893
02:04:43,849 --> 02:04:46,434
Your time

894
02:04:49,396 --> 02:04:52,982
If you could
would you come with me

895
02:04:53,066 --> 02:04:55,943
To the other side

896
02:04:58,237 --> 02:05:02,490
Forever may not
belong enough

897
02:05:02,574 --> 02:05:06,827
Forever may not
belong enough

898
02:05:06,911 --> 02:05:10,372
Forever may not
belong enough

899
02:05:10,498 --> 02:05:14,584
For this life

900
02:05:14,710 --> 02:05:16,878
Forever

901
02:05:19,297 --> 02:05:21,215
Forever

902
02:05:23,718 --> 02:05:26,053
Forever

903
02:05:28,221 --> 02:05:30,389
Forever

904
02:05:32,642 --> 02:05:34,810
Forever

905
02:05:37,104 --> 02:05:39,355
Forever

906
02:05:42,651 --> 02:05:45,820
Forever may not
belong enough

907
02:05:45,945 --> 02:05:48,238
For you to know

908
02:05:51,492 --> 02:05:55,078
Just how far I traveled
Just how far

909
02:05:55,203 --> 02:05:58,413
I will go

910
02:06:00,457 --> 02:06:03,584
Open your heart
and everything

911
02:06:03,669 --> 02:06:06,462
Will be allright

912
02:06:09,215 --> 02:06:12,467
Open your heart, baby
Leave with me

913
02:06:12,594 --> 02:06:16,930
Don't be afraid

914
02:06:17,014 --> 02:06:19,307
Forever

915
02:06:21,517 --> 02:06:23,810
Forever

916
02:06:25,980 --> 02:06:28,231
Forever

917
02:06:30,442 --> 02:06:32,693
Forever

918
02:06:44,997 --> 02:06:47,999
Forever may not
belong enough

919
02:06:48,124 --> 02:06:50,500
For our love

920
02:06:52,794 --> 02:06:55,462
Forever

921
02:06:57,174 --> 02:06:59,842
Forever

922
02:07:01,552 --> 02:07:04,512
Forever

923
02:07:06,057 --> 02:07:11,602
Forever

924
02:07:11,686 --> 02:07:15,814
Forever may not
belong enough

925
02:07:15,899 --> 02:07:20,193
Forever may not
belong enough

926
02:07:20,319 --> 02:07:23,279
Forever may not
belong enough

927
02:07:23,363 --> 02:07:26,698
It might belong enough
