00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,242
您应该事先想到这一点。
You should have thought of that beforehand.

2
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,702
一旦出门，这将是一个不好的记忆。
Once you're out it'll just be a bad memory.

女士们，你晚了。

12
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,704
永无止境的繁文tape节和文书工作。
Never-ending red tape and paperwork.

13
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,669
我不在乎！
I don't care!

14
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,003
这不是我的错。
It wasn't my fault.

15
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,089
我不得不等待文书工作。
I had to wait for the paperwork.

16
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,935
在这里，一切都是顺序的。
Here, it's all in order.

17
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,798
我们不应该带走一个女孩吗？
Aren't we supposed to take away a girl?

18
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,279
是的。
Yes.

19
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,068
带她过来。
Bring her over.

20
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:48,081
今天早上我们在她的牢房里找到了她。她死了。
We found her in her cell this morning. She was dead.

21
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:52,666
这很愚蠢。她知道她将在几天内被释放。
It's stupid. She knew she was going to be freed in a few days.

22
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,171
她总是害怕自由。
She always was scared of freedom.

23
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:55,876
自杀？
A suicide?

24
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,167
她的文书工作就在她旁边的棺材旁边。
Her paperwork's right next to her in the coffin.

25

由管理者签名并批准。

00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:07,184
我再说一遍，下次您会准时在这里。

27
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,687
让新来者挺身而出。
Make the newcomers come forward for their instructions.

28
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,689
你的名字？
Your name?

29
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:17,357
-Nathalie Mendoza。 - 在这里您说“夫人”。
- Nathalie mendoza. - Here you say "madame."

30
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,365
你的电话号码？

这次你在这里多长时间？
How long are you here for this time?

00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,975
一年，夫人。

00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,066
这取决于您的行为。
That depends on your behavior.

37
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:01,822
否则，我将使您的假期持续更长的时间。
Otherwise I'll make your vacation last longer.

38
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,198
保持一件事。
Get one thing straight.

39
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,494
从现在开始，
Starting right now,

40
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,404
你没有个性。
you have no personality.

41
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,243
你什么都不是。
You are nothing.

42
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,158
你只不过是数字。
You are nothing but numbers.

43
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,160
忘记你存在。
Forget that you exist.

44
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,885
- 你好。 - 重新到达...
- Hello. - Anew arrival...

45
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,848
新来者在这个地狱中的分心是一个很好的分散注意力。
A newcomer's a nice distraction in this hellhole.

46
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,021
杰西卡！
Jessica!

47
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,643
后退？这次你在里什么？
Back? What are you in for this time?

48
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:22,947
什么问题。
What a question.

49
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,862
同样旧。我不背叛原因。
Same old. I don't betray the cause.

50
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,523
helga！
Helga!

51
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,533
她生病了。
She's sick.

52
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,535
WHO？纳塔莉？
Who? Nathalie?

53
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:31,831
是的。 98号
Yes. Number 98

54
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,664
她很好。不要全力以赴。
she's fine. don't get all worked up.

55
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,121
当然，她不感到热。
Of course she's not feeling hot.

56
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,206
她需要修复。
She needs a fix.

57
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,500
警察把她钉在船上。
The cops nailed her on a boat.

58
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,009
她没有票，但没有足够的海洛因来满足成瘾者。
She was riding with no ticket but with enough heroin to satisfy an army of addicts.

59
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,919
有人不能帮她吗？
Can't anyone help her?

60
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:51,511
她正在接受特殊的家庭治疗。
She's getting the special house treatment.

61
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,596
她要去冷火鸡。
She's going cold Turkey.

62
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,391
现在还可以。
For now it's ok.

63
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,603
完成后，她将失去所有的头发。
Once they're done, she'll lose all her hair.

64
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,393
来吧，躺下孩子。
Come on, lie down kid.

65
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,403
放松。你必须睡觉。
Relax. You've got to sleep.

66
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,485
您无论如何都不能做任何事情。
You can't do anything anyhow.

67
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,132
哦，别哭。
Oh, don't cry.

68
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,973
说，我曾经告诉过你为什么我在这里吗？
Say, did I ever tell you why I'm in here?

69
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,683
不，为什么？
No. Why?

70
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,769
这不是秘密。
It's no secret.

71
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,732
卖淫。我操了一个我不应该有的家伙。
Prostitution. I fucked a fella I shouldn't have.

72
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,817
你呢？
How about you?

73
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:54,987
我敢打赌，你想着一些非常疯狂的东西。
I bet you're in for something pretty wild.

74
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,829
来吧，不要哭。
Come on, don't cry.

75
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,333
我要进入那个羽毛床。
I'm gonna get in that featherbed.

76
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,277
州长，我希望你很开心。
Governor, I hope you were entertained.

77
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:35,034
哦，那个白色的天使。
Oh, that white angel.

78
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,787
他很兴奋。
He was ravishing.

79
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,950
我知道你会喜欢他。
I knew you would like him.

80
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,083
还有新的被拘留者？
And the new detainees?

81
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,205
他们中间有一个小小的金发...
There's a little blond among them...

82
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,000
编号99。
Number 99.

83
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,089
年轻的，

00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,590
令人兴奋，身体很好。
exciting, with a nice body.

85
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,305
我认为您可能宁愿喜欢她。
I think you might rather like her.

86
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,227
我稍后再见。
I'll see about her later.

87
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,229
我今天有很多工作。
I have a lot of work today.

88
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,892
谢谢您这么快的州长。

89
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,356

91
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,738
很快，您将能够证明自己的奉献精神。
And very soon you will be able to prove your devotion.

92
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:21,786
您非常了解我喜欢对待我的奉献者。
You know very well how I like to treat my devotees.

93
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,037
你说99？
You said 99?

94
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,797
是的。
Yes.

95
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,792
好吧
Alright

96
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:36,342
但是要谨慎。
but proceed with caution.

97
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:40,391
有人告诉我，死去的女孩的背部深深地疤痕。
The dead girl, I'm told, has deep scars all over her back.

98
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,766
我坚持所有被拘留者都接受纪律和劳动。
I insist all detainees submit to discipline and labor.

99
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,814
但是我们有一个新司法部长
But we have a new justice minister

100
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,601
而且他注定要热心。
and he is bound to be zealous.

101
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,613
您一定不能忘记这是今年第二次死亡。
You mustn't forget this is the second death this year.

102
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,694
是的，是的，我知道。所以呢？
Yes, yes, I know. So what?

103
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,700
我们必须避免麻烦。
We must avoid trouble.

104
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,282
总督，麻烦就是我整天的全天。
Trouble is all I have all day long, governor.

105
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,288
我习惯了麻烦。
I'm used to trouble.

106
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,415
编号99 ...
Number 99...

107
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,461
我必须先看囚犯。
I must first see to prisoners.

108
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,422
危险，残酷的男人。
Dangerous, brutal men.

109
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,300
我们什么时候再次见面？

00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,638
也许明天。
Tomorrow perhaps.

111
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,882
我会记得看...

112
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,301
编号99。

00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,306

这将带来极大的荣幸。
It will be with great pleasure.

115
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,292
什么？这是什么？
What? What is it?

116
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:47,924
你想要什么？
What do you want?

117
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,586
没有什么。
Nothing.

118
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,675
你有一场噩梦。
You had a nightmare.

119
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,943
- 谁哭了？ - 纳塔莉（Nathalie）。
- Who was it that cried out? - Nathalie.

120
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,944
她病得很重。
She is seriously ill.

121
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,280
哦...来吧！睡觉。
Oh... come on! Go to sleep.

122
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,074
这不是让她生病的毒品。
It's not the drugs making her sick.

123
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,664
你知道什么？你是医生吗？
What do you know? Are you a doctor?

124
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,670
不，我只有一种感觉。
No, I just have a feeling.

125
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,548
您认为我们应该做什么？
What do you think we should do?

126
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,878
我们应该打电话给警卫。让她叫医生。
We should call a guard. Make her call a doctor.

127
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,406
警卫！
Guard!

128
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,575
警卫！
Guard!

129
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,283
你会闭嘴吗？
Will you shut up?

130
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,332
编号99。
Number 99.

131
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,209
99！

132
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,291
是的，夫人。
Yes, madame.

133
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,129
对不服从的惩罚，

00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,587
您会学到的，在洞中8天。

135
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,505
纳塔莉很狡猾。
Nathalie is delirious.

136
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,968
她要死了。
She's going to die.

137
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,725
以及拒绝服从董事的惩罚
And the punishment for refusing to obey the director

138
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,178
在孔中为15天。

139
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,268
我希望你已经理解了！
I hope you have understood!

140
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,559
你好，医生。
Hello, doctor.

141
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,975
那很快。
That was quick.

142
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,272
她已经死了。
She was already dead.

143
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,521
几乎总是如此。
That's how it almost always is.

144
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,066
这个女人成为导演多久了？
How long has this woman been the director?

145
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,068
哦，一定已经十年了。
Oh, it must be 10 years already.

146
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,150
她曾经是一名警卫。
She used to be a guard.

147
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,776
没有人离开那个地方。
No one ever leaves that place.

148
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,537
我们会看到的。
We'll see about that.

149
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,149
快点！
Faster!

150
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,782
否则您将在洞中获得几天的时间。快点！
Or you'll get days in the hole. Faster!

151
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:34,874
您的句子多长时间？
How long is your sentence?

152
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,960
十五个月。要长。
Fifteen months. It's going to be long.

153
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,374
你呢？
How about you?

00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,418
相同的。这是我的第一句话。

我去过这里呆了十天。

156
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,093
你能接受吗？
Can you take it?

157
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,893
这不是我介意的工作。
It's not the work I mind.

158
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,975
嘿，公主，想念你在走路的那些街道吗？
Hey, Princess, miss those streets you were walking?

159
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,104
关闭陷阱，否则可能会生锈。
Shut your trap or it might rust.

160
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,945
那是没有办法为妓女说话。
That's no way to talk for a hooker.

161
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,684
停止它。你疯了！
Stop it. You're crazy!

162
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,065
停止！
Stop!

163
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,276
你们两个，跟我来。
You two, come with me.

164
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,492
其余的人，继续工作。
The rest of you, keep working.

165
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,088
他们会发生什么？
What's gonna happen to them?

166
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,170
他们会对他们做什么？
What'll they do to them?

167
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,635
这将是一个聚会。
It'll be a party.

168
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,232
晚上好。
Good evening.

169

像往常一样准时。

170

我今天不是你的第一个访客？
I am not your first visitor today?

171
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,691
不。
No.

172
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,780
医生已经到今天早上了。
The doctor has been by this morning.

173
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,865
其中一个是...
One of the girls is...

00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,951
死的。我知道。
Dead. I know.

175
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,622
我怎么知道这不是一个行为？
How could I have known it wasn't an act?

176
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,833
哦，那不是责备。
Oh, that was not a reproach.

177
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,669
我不是新司法部长。
I am not the new justice minister.

178
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,636
今晚很热。
It's hot tonight.

医生说，将向部长发送报告。
The doctor said a report would be sent to the minister.

180

好吧，我们在那里。
Well, there we are.

181
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,522
正是我一直担心的。
Just what I have been fearing.

182
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,685
但是部长的工作应仅限于寻找负责犯罪的人。
But the minister's job should be limited to finding those responsible for crimes.

183
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,943
这些是可以解决的问题。
These are matters that can be solved.

184
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,484
我会给你你的酒。
I'll get you your glass of wine.

185
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,407
让我们谈谈更多令人愉快的事情。
Let's talk about more pleasant matters.

186
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,417
数字997如何？
How is number 997?

187
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,673
你知道，亲爱的，你种了种子。
You know, you planted that seed, my dear.

188
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,967
她与另一个女孩打架。
She got in a fight with another girl.

189
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,632
我不得不相应地惩罚她。

190
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:30,932
谁是另一个女孩？

00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,807
numbr 76你知道那个。

00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,890
她是一年来这里的人。
She's the one that's been here for a year.

194
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,601
啊，是的。佐伊。

195
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,606
她受伤了。

她被锁在医务室。

197
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,607
和她亲爱的朋友99。

198
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:49,607
他们会呆在那里，直到他们化妆。
They'll stay there until they've made up.

199
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,785
好吧，他们必须受到州长的惩罚。
Well, they must be punished governor.

200
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,334
惩罚的选择，我会留给你。
The choice of punishment, I will leave to you.

201
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,834
真的吗？
Really?

202
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,589
我真的认为您错过了您的电话，Thelma。
I really think you missed your calling, Thelma.

203
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,256
我可以看到你是一个经营妓院的夫人。
I can see you as a madame running a brothel.

204
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,674
不，州长。
No, governor.

205
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:18,469
你很清楚我在这里找到了我的真实职业
You know very well that I have found my true vocation here

206
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:22,640
而且我奉献自己，身体和灵魂。
and that I am devoting myself to it, body and soul.

207
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,647
的确。
Indeed.

208
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,888
你要停止呼唤吗？
Are you going to stop bawling?

209
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,181
足够的！你听到了吗？
Enough! Do you hear?

210
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,314
这是毫无意义的。
It's pointless.

211
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,326
别哭了。
Stop crying.

212
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,621
是因为你和那个妓女
It's because of you and that whore

213
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:30,462
我的腿都被刮了。
that my leg is all scraped up.

214
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,302
我不是在哭。
And I'm not crying.

00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,840
你听到了吗？我从未哭过。
Do you hear? I have never cried.

216
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,764
快点。这里。
Come on. Here.

217
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:46,898

223
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,658
有时很难区分爱与仇恨。

他们可以很好地同居。

一段时间以来，有关该主题的更多信息。

你可怜的东西。那是最糟糕的。

哦，你知道，

242
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,719
我没什么意思。

313
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,948
是的，很高兴。
Yes, gladly.

314
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,170
所以你是Leonie Carole？
So you are leonie Carole?

315
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,085
是的。
Yes.

316
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:12,722
我叫桑托斯。我是州长，因此您的上司。
My name is Santos. I am the governor, hence your superior.

317
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,679
部长确实告诉了我。
The minister did inform me of it.

318
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:18,641
他想收到每日报告。
He would like to receive a daily report.

319
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,940
自然。
Naturally.

320
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,227
但是您必须给我发送一份副本。
But you must send me a copy of it.

321
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,313
坐下。
Sit down.

322
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:29,280
您应该知道，我对您被发送到这里并不感到惊讶。
You should know, I'm not surprised that you've been sent here.

323
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:31,362
我懂了。
I see.

324
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,822
这里发生了可怕的事情。
Terrible things have happened here.

325
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:36,864
导演迪亚兹夫人有点过失。
Madame Diaz, the director, has been a little too negligent.

326
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:40,658
我一直告诉她：“你努力工作，但你太多了。”
I keep telling her, "you work hard but there's too much that gets by you."

327
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,664
是的。
Yes.

328
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,081
她应该辞职。
She should resign.

329
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,379
我要求她待更长的时间
I have asked her to stay on a little longer

330
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,465
我懂了。
I see.

331
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:55,514
你是一个战术思想家。
You're something of a tactical thinker.

332
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,893
我会容纳你。我确定我们会相处的。
I'll accommodate you. I'm sure we'll get along.

333
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,974
我敢肯定。
Of that, I am certain.

334
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,644
您应该解决。
You should get settled.

335
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,105
让我了解这里发生的一切。
Keep me abreast of everything that goes on here.

336
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,111
我希望一切都会顺利进行，州长。
I hope everything will go well, governor.

337
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,718
一个建议，小姐Carole，
One piece of advice, mademoiselle Carole,

338
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,028
您必须尊重秩序和纪律的严格性。
you must respect the strictness of order and discipline.

339
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:16,161
如果通过弱点，您对这些女孩的丝毫丝毫
If, through weakness, you concede the slightest thing to these girls

340
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,242
您将不再拥有任何权威。
you will no longer have any authority.

341
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,157
请记住，Carole小姐。
Remember that, mademoiselle Carole.

342
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:23,952
再见，州长。
Goodbye, governor.

343
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,253
我相信我们很快会再次见面。
I am sure we will see each other again soon.

344
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,582
我也是。
So am I.

345
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,276
我不吓到你，对吗？
I don't scare you, do I?

346
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:54,903
不，别管我。
No. Leave me alone.

347
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,034
我为你感到。
I feel for you.

348
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:00,201
他们真的把你操了。
They really fucked you up.

349
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,665
就像你在乎。
Like you care.

350
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,998
你知道，有一段时间，我也有像你这样的愿望。
You know, there was a time, I too had aspirations like you.

351
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,003
我是舞者。
I was a dancer.

352
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,381
我发誓，一个奇妙的生活，
A marvelous life, I swear,

353
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,338
以及有史以来最好的工作。
and the best job ever.

354
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,428
每个人都认识我。
Everyone knew me.

355
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,226
我拥有了。
I had it all.

356
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,811
这些人都在追我。
The men were all after me.

357
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,226
它可能持续了，但是老板嫉妒我。
It could have lasted, but the boss was jealous of me.

358
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,373
摘下！
Take it off!

359
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,666
为什么？它打扰你吗？
Why? Does it bother you?

360
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,540
一天晚上，我遇到了一个男人。
One night, I met a man.

361
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:09,875
我为他疯狂。
I was crazy about him.

362
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:13,004
我不知道她在看我们。
I didn't know she was watching us.

363
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,111
晚上好，佐伊。
Good evening, Zoe.

364
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,996
卡拉。
Carla.

365
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,346
妓女！
Whore!

366
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:11,813
那真是可怕的佐伊。
That's terrible Zoe.

367
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:02,075
她怎么把你赶出了洞？
How come she got you out of the hole?

368
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:03,541
我不知道。
I don't know.

369
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,870
她不像其他人。她与众不同。
She's not like the others. She's different.

370
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:08,957
提防。
Watch out.

371
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,042
她可能比bit子更糟。
She might be worse than the bitch.

372
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:14,550
当心。她出去了。
Be careful. She's out for something.

373
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:18,633
我今天早上见到她，她似乎还可以。
I saw her this morning and she seemed ok.

374
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,979
您应该问她她是怎么来这里的。
You should have asked her how she ended up here.

375
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,678
通常只是旧的巫婆。
It's usually just old hags here.

376
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,845
你为什么不问她？
Why don't you ask her?

377
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:31,275
99号。跟我来。
Number 99. Come with me.

378
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,357
好吧，好吧。
Well, well.

379
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:48,409
离开我们。
Leave us.

380
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,879
坐下，玛丽。
Sit down, Marie.

381
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:05,639
你为什么受到惩罚？你做了什么？
Why were you punished? What had you done?

382
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:07,724
因为我呼吁帮助。
Because I called out for help.

383
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,433
为什么？
Why?

384
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:12,316
其中一个女孩病了。她需要一名医生。
One of the girls was sick. She needed a doctor.

385
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,522
医生来了吗？
Did a doctor come?

386
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:16,945
我不知道。
I don't know.

387
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,822
女孩在哪里？
Where is the girl?

388
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,410
她死了。
She's dead.

389
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:30,622
你来这里多久了？
How long have you been here?

390
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,538
七天。
Seven days.

391
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:38,050
自从您到达以来，您一直在洞中？
And you've been in the hole ever since you arrived?

392
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:02,696
你为什么在这里？你做了什么？
Why are you here? What have you done?

393
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:04,326
告诉我。
Tell me.

394
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,912
我研究了您的文件。
I have studied your file.

395
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,573
我学到了很多。
I haven't learned very much.

396
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:14,829
我想了解您在这里的最终结果。
I'd like to understand how you ended up here.

397
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,248
现在来。冷静下来。
Come now. Calm down.

398
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,877
那么，发生了什么事？
So, what happened?

399
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,339
告诉我。
Tell me.

400
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,765
尝试。
Try.

401
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:37,060
那天晚上，我在等公共汽车。
That night I was waiting for the bus.

402
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,813
一个骑摩托车的男人为我提供了骑车。
A man on a motorbike offered me a ride.

403
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,072
我和他一起去。
I went with him.

404
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,614
天黑了
It was dark

405
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:49,447
而且我不知道该地区。
and I didn't know the area.

406
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,910
他带我去了很多。
He took me to a dirt lot.

407
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,210
总共有四个人...
There were four men in all...

408
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,418
可怕的野蛮人。
Horrible brutes.

409
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:00,958
他们攻击了我。
They attacked me.

410
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,372
如何，怎么样。
Come, come.

411
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:48,292
其中一个有刀。
One of them had a knife.

412
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:50,677
我试图从他那里拿走它。
I tried to take it from him.

413
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,805
突然我意识到，我被鲜血覆盖。
Suddenly I realized,I was covered in blood.

414
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:54,715
你杀了他。
You killed him.

415
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,258
不！不！
No! No!

416
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:58,803
法院仍然认为您有罪。
Still the court found you guilty.

417
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:00,746
没有人相信我。我说实话。
No one believes me. I'm telling the truth.

418
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:04,483
我认为发生的是您正在转动技巧
What I think happened is that you were turning tricks

419
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:08,236
当其中一名男子拒绝向您付钱时，您要问的钱
and when one of the men refused to pay you the money you were asking

420
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,898
你战斗，愤怒地杀了他。
you fought and in a rage you killed him.

421
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:14,944
不，为什么没有人相信我？
No, why won't anyone believe me?

422
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:22,038
好的。
All right.

423
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,373
现在我相信你。
Now I do believe you.

424
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,506
但是记住这一点。
But remember this.

425
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:36,139
所有受到谴责，自称是无辜的人。
All those who are condemned, claim to be innocent.

426
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:39,177
很少有人说实话。
Very few are telling the truth.

427
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:42,562
我会要求您的文件发送给我。
I will ask for your file to be sent to me.

428
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:47,314
不过，逆转的机会很小。
Though, the chances of a reversal are very slim.

429
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:49,820
现在回到您的牢房。
Go back to your cell now.

430
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:52,739
谢谢你，夫人。
Thank you, madame.

431
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:59,618
这个Leonie Carole并不像您首先想到的那样愚蠢。
This leonie Carole is not as stupid as you had first thought.

432
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,953
我从没想过她很愚蠢。
I never thought her stupid.

433
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:05,707
我认为她很聪明
I think she's very clever

434
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:09,715
而且她在这里不是要解雇微不足道的监狱董事，而是你。
and that she's here not to fire an insignificant prison director, but rather, you.

435
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,797
我？那太荒谬了。
Me? That's absurd.

436
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:15,838
部长对我完全有信心。
The minister has complete confidence in me.

437
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,756
你确定吗？
Are you sure of that?

438
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,051
是的，我有声誉。
Yes, I have a reputation.

439
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:21,935
真的吗？
Really?

440
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:25,389
我们需要防止她可能造成的伤害。
We need to prevent the harm she might do.

441
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:28,399
想想她将发送的报告。
Think of the reports she will send.

442
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,571
你说得对。我们必须采取行动。
You're right. We must act.

443
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,779
为时已晚。
Before it's too late.

444
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:40,913
在她向他发送报告之前，他将收到我们的报告。
Before she's sent him her report, he will receive our report on her.

445
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:43,745
好主意。我们必须在此问题上积极主动。
Good idea. We must be proactive in this matter.

446
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:45,534
绝对地。
Absolutely.

447
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:50,714
但是我们能发现什么反对她？
But what can we find against her?

448
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:53,129
我注意到了
I have noticed

449
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:57,671
她试图获得某些被拘留者的信任。
that she tries hard to gain the trust of certain detainees.

450
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:59,385
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

451
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:02,643
她可能对其中一个女孩感兴趣
Might she be interested in one of these girls

452
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:05,187
而不是你，州长？
instead of you, governor?

453
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,642
什么？
What?

454
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,149
多么好主意。
What a great idea.

455
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:16,864
让我们不要浪费时间。
Let's not waste any time.

456
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,823
给我姓名，详细信息，事实，我想要所有的细节。
Give me names, details, facts, I want all the saucy details.

457
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:22,704
哦，我会给你。
Oh, I will give them to you.

458
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:28,539
简而言之，州长，
In a nutshell, governor,

459
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,421
她爱上了99号。
she's in love with number 99.

460
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,135
快点！
Faster!

461
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,387
快来！
Come on now!

462
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,096
看！
Look!

463
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:02,911
- 胡安·迭戈！ - 你知道那个家伙吗？
- Juan Diego! - You know that guy?

464
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,079
是的。
Yes.

465
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,744
我必须和他说话。
I have to talk to him.

466
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:12,379
等等，我有一个主意。
Wait, I have an idea.

467
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:13,674
打败它。
Beat it.

468
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,628
去！快的。
Go! Quick.

469
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:25,429
赦免我，但我需要和你说话。
Pardon me, but I need to talk to you.

470
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:27,313
最后！
Finally!

471
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:27,134
我试图告诉你。
I tried to get word to you.

472
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,675
我想告诉你我还好。
I wanted to tell you I was ok.

473
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,886
- 这是什么？ - 什么都没有...只是划痕。
- What's this? - Nothing... just a scratch.

474
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,771
听，
Listen,

475
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:38,016
在岛的另一端
at the other end of the island

476
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,811
有一个渔民村。
there's a village of fishermen.

477
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:42,604
他们有船。
They have boats.

478
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:44,819
十天后，在新月，
In ten days, at the new moon,

479
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:48,861
一个朋友和我要逃脱。
a friend and I are going to escape.

480
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:51,325
但是胡安，我在哪里可以找到你？
But Juan, where will I find you?

481
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:59,622
距离村庄有两个港口。
Two kilometers from the village there's a port.

482
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:02,041
我们将在黎明时在那里等您。
We'll wait for you there, at daybreak.

483
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:04,335
哦，罗莎莉。
Oh, Rosalie.

484
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:08,839
当心。
Be careful.

485
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:39,961
土壤
Zoel

486
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,709
什么玛丽？你想要什么？
what Marie? What do you want?

487
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:49,508
你为什么不睡觉，梦见你的新女朋友？
Why don't you go to sleep and dream of your new girlfriend?

488
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,566
她永远不会让你离开这里。
She'll never get you out of here.

489
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:04,936
您可以确定。
You can be sure of that.

490
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,640
她会和你一起睡几次
She'll sleep with you several times

491
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,524
然后让你在这里腐烂。
and then leave you to rot here.

492
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,592
给你的信。
A letter for you.

493
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,224
谢谢。
Thank you.

494
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:41,685
被拘留者想紧急与您交谈。
A detainee wants to speak to you urgently.

495
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:43,316
哪一个？
Which one?

496
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,476
编号99。
Number 99.

497
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,733
我饿了。
I'm hungry.

498
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:51,108
我也是。
Me too.

499
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:57,330
您为什么不要求Mercy姐妹在这里做一些有关食物的事情？
Why don't you ask sister mercy to do something about the food here?

500
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:00,162
我只见过她两次。
I've only seen her twice.

501
01:04:01,129 --> 01:04:04,371
她会同意您的要求。你是她的宠物。
She'll agree to whatever you ask. You're her pet.

502
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,836
哦，闭嘴。
Oh, shut up.

503
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,753
您介意您的嘴并远离此。
You mind your mouth and stay out of this.

504
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:15,549
我知道你不挖女孩。
I know you don't dig girls.

505
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,809
妓女！你的垃圾！
Whore! You piece of trash!

506
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,564
荡妇！
Slut!

507
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:30,104
我会告诉你！
I'll show youl!

508
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:51,376
这是怎么回事？
What's going on here?

509
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,421
足够的！你听到我的声音吗？
Enough! Do you hear me?

510
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,134
停止！
Stop!

511
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:59,475
你知道你应得的吗？
You know what you deserve?

512
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:01,933
发生了什么？
What happened?

513
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:06,020
他们战斗。
They fought.

514
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,736
数字97和数字76。
Number 97 and number 76.

515
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:16,071
我可以看到。
I can see that.

516
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:22,123
面包和水只持续两天。
Bread and water only for two days.

517
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:26,169
他们每个人都会在洞中进行7天。
They'll each do seven days in the hole.

518
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,705
不，不是洞。
No. Not the hole.

519
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:32,250
这种惩罚已被消除。
That punishment has been eliminated.

520
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:48,559
你好。
Hello.

521
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,186
玛丽，你为什么要见我？
Why did you ask to see me, Marie?

522
01:05:57,245 --> 01:05:58,826
这是什么？
What is it?

523
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:02,660
我想知道您是否发现了有关我的案子的新事物。
I wanted to know if you had found out anything new about my case.

524
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:05,166
是的。
Yes.

525
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:08,243
对不起，我无能为力。我收到答案。
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do. I received an answer.

526
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:12,458
您的情况很清楚。没有机会进行审查。
Your case is clear. There's no chance for a review.

527
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,418
给我看信。
Show me the letter.

528
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:18,175
我摧毁了它。
I destroyed it.

529
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,347
我不相信你。
I don't believe you.

530
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:24,219
你是什​​么意思？
What do you mean?

531
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:27,430
你们都知道他们都在说什么吗？
Do you know what they all say?

532
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:29,816
您无所事事地帮助我离开这里。
You'll do nothing to help me get out of here.

533
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,732
玛丽，为什么我无能为力？
Marie, why would I do nothing to help?

534
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:36,819
显然，首先我必须和你一起睡觉。
Apparently first I'd have to sleep with you.

535
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:46,199
就像其他人一样，你是个bit子。
You're a bitch, just like the others.

536
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:48,585
你真令人恶心。
You're disgusting.

537
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:10,268
所以，小。
So, chiquita.

538
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:12,604
我什么时候可以离开这里？
When can I get out of here?

539
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:16,779
也许很快。我看到它来了。
Maybe soon. I see it coming.

540
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,782
你是什​​么意思？
What do you mean?

541
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:31,165
我们的好天使已经下达了命令。
Our good angel has given orders.

542
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:33,705
不再有夜间手表。
No more night watches.

543
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:38,923
我有一个好主意，
I have a great idea,

544
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:44,262
但是我们需要三个。
but we would need to have three.

545
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,220
我们需要罗莎莉，
We'd need Rosalie,

546
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:52,186
我...
me...

547
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:10,705
你呢。
And you.

548
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:19,759
这并不容易。距丛林30公里。
It won't be easy. It's 30 kilometers into the jungle.

549
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,669
如果我们不这样做，
And if we don't make it,

550
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:30,102
我们将被皇家搞砸。
We'll be royally screwed.

551
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:32,389
我不在乎。
I don't care.

552
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:44,200
所以你进去了吗？
So you're in?

553
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,116
我在里面。
I'm in.

554
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:53,462
这里。
Here.

555
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:55,036
拿钥匙。
Take the keys.

556
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:08,717
我必须告知您一个新规则有效。
I must inform you a new rule is in effect.

557
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,102
如果晚上被拘留者生病，
If during the night a detainee is sick,

558
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:12,978
你必须敲钟。
you must ring the bell.

559
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:15,234
但是，如果您没有充分理由打扰警卫，
But if you disturb the guards without good reason,

560
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:17,483
你会受到惩罚。
you'll be punished.

561
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:43,084
我感觉不好！
I don't feel good!

562
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,716
我很恶心。
I am so sick.

563
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:09,121
怎么了？
What's the matter?

564
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,903
我病了。
I'm sick.

565
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:20,705
一举一动，我会割你的喉咙！
One move and I'll slit your throat!

566
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:14,368
我不会做到。
I won't make it.

567
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,951
罗莎莉，请。尝试挂在那里。
Rosalie, please. Try to hang in there.

568
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:23,961
我们现在不能停止。我们不能呆在这里！
We can't stop now. We can't stay here!

569
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,633
勇敢。
Be brave.

570
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:42,305
艰难的部分结束了。
The hard part's over.

571
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,099
你听到了吗？
Do you hear that?

572
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:55,526
警报器。
The sirens.

573
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,036
他们意识到我们走了。
They've realized we're gone.

574
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:58,867
来吧，快点！
Come on, hurry!

575
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:05,328
那些bit子。我认为他们警告了男士的监狱！
Those bitches. I think they alerted the men's penitentiary!

576
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:07,338
快来吧，迅速！
Come on, quickly!

577
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:47,699
嘿！多么的水果蛋糕。
Hey! What a fruitcake.

578
01:15:48,002 --> 01:15:49,788
直接从丛林中。
Straight from the jungle.

579
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:51,622
水果蛋糕？
Fruitcake?

580
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:54,838
看起来我们使用同一裁缝。
Looks like we use the same tailor.

581
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:56,965
看！
Look!

582
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:10,930
你什么时候逃脱的？
When did you escape?

583
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:13,436
今晨。
This morning.

584
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,481
胡安迭戈在哪里？
Where is Juan Diego?

585
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,574
快点。来这里。
Come on. Come here.

586
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:30,787
你是罗莎莉吗？
Are you Rosalie?

587
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:32,170
是的，我是罗莎莉。
Yes, I'm Rosalie.

588
01:16:32,463 --> 01:16:34,624
胡安·迭戈在哪里？我打算见他。
Where's Juan Diego? I'd planned to meet him.

589
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:40,386
他给了我这个。
He gave me this.

590
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:42,344
是你的。
It's yours.

591
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:46,716
是的。这是怎么回事？
Yes, it is. What's going on?

592
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:51,183
当他们看到我们逃脱时，警卫射击了胡安·迭戈。
The guards shot Juan Diego when they saw us escape.

593
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,696
哦，胡安！
Oh, Juan!

594
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:14,164
现在他们在你的路上。
Now they're on your trail.

595
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,666
逃脱时，我们将要上班。
We were going to work when we escaped.

596
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,376
那是胡安...
That's when Juan...

597
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:21,042
稍后我会感谢您的所作所为。
I'll thank you later for what you've done.

598
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,631
告诉我，你知道丛林吗？
Tell me, do you know the jungle?

599
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:25,804
不。
No.

600
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,091
但是大海应该直接向前。
But the sea should be straight ahead.

601
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:30,851
我们会更好地坚持在一起。
We'd do better to stick together.

602
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:34,389
如果我们没有迅速地进行地面，我们就会完成。
If we don't make ground quickly we're done for.

603
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,646
我们该怎么办，我们应该...
What should we do, we should...

604
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:22,686
我们应该沿着河流下来。
We should follow the river down.

605
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,190
它一定会通向大海。
It's bound to lead to the sea.

606
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:25,565
大海在哪里？
Where's the sea?

607
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:28,575
让我们前往山上。我们会找到它。
Let's head toward the mountains. We'll find it.

608
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:30,327
那不会导致我们进入印章
That won't lead us to the seal

609
01:18:30,623 --> 01:18:31,988
你还有另一个建议吗？
do you have another suggestion?

610
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:34,202
我们会按他说的那样做。
We'll do as he says.

611
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:36,659
我们走吧。迅速地！
Let's go. Quickly!

612
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:02,355
他们深入丛林。
They're going deep into the jungle.

613
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:05,192
他们不会在山上找到我们。
They won't find us in the mountains.

614
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:07,405
不，我不会做到！
No, I'm not gonna make it!

615
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:08,406
是的，你会的！
Yes, you will!

616
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:10,192
快点。
Come on.

617
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:30,884
不，罗莎莉，请停下来。
No, Rosalie, please stop.

618
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:34,432
勇敢。
Be brave.

619
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:41,561
你和胡安就像兄弟，对吗？
You and Juan were like brothers, right?

620
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,566
你可以这么说。

您不认为他们受到了足够的惩罚吗？

I know what I have to do. Sanctions are in place against the escapees.

明天我们将检查所有被拘留者。
