The cemetery, Dad.

92
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,792
- And played the piano.
- Piano.

93

And crosswords.

00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:12,375
Even when she was older?

96
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,917
Is that important?

97
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:17,667
Sure, she did the
crossword puzzle every day.

98
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,250
OK. Fine.

99

If it was part of her life, why not?

102
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:25,440

Did she like nature, or animals?

124
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,125
in World War II.

00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,040
Like that?

195
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
Like that?

196
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,250
I didn't know
you were bringing her.

197
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:22,560
Do you like it?

198
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:23,625
Do you like it?

199
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:28,042
Take it off!

200
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:28,318
Off.

201
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,319
Off.

202
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,417
Come up to me.

203
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:33,542
No.

204
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,080
You come down.

205
00:17:34,081 --> 00:17:35,167
You come down.

206
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,792
- Are you playing the domina again?
- Alright.

207
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,750
You have to...

208
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:45,600
You have to dominate me a bit,
I need it today.

209
00:17:45,601 --> 00:17:48,750
You have to dominate me a bit,
I need it today.

210
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,250
God, beautiful!

211
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:51,360
Good, first let's have a drink.

212
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,167
Good, first let's have a drink.

213
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,000
Vodka doesn't smell on your breath.

214
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,208
- No?
- An old singer's trick.

215
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,042
Be right back.

216
00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:14,400
Your mom's sleeping, right?

217
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:16,417
Your mom's sleeping, right?

218
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:17,917
Yeah, probably.

219
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,159
I mean, I'm open-minded.

220
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,750
I mean, I'm open-minded.

221
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:23,000
But it still feels weird.

222
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,792
She's almost deaf.

223
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,167
Dunno how reassuring that is.

224
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:36,250
When did you arrive?

225
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:39,917
Baby?

226
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Well...

227
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,199
Doesn't matter.

228
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,292
Doesn't matter.

229
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:44,875
You're here now.

230
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,875
Bella Rimini...

231
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:48,875
in winter.

232
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,417
Spread'em!

233
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:54,167
You horny slut.

234
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,333
Sorry.

235
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:00,480
God, I missed that!

236
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:02,125
God, I missed that!

237
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,917
Your juicy cunt!

238
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,239
Does it taste strange?

239
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,375
Does it taste strange?

240
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,417
- It tastes wonderful.
- Really?

241
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:09,917
It tastes like you.

242
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't like perfumed snatch.

243
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:14,125
I don't like perfumed snatch.

244
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:12,292
What's this?

245
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:13,750
Who are you?

246
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,360
Who are you?

247
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,375
Who are you?

248
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,875
What a cutie pie!

249
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,119
You're such a little sweetheart!

250
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,125
You're such a little sweetheart!

251
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:23,500
Yes, you're adorable!

252
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,500
A little sweetheart.

253
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:26,879
Yes, yes, yes.

254
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,250
Yes, yes, yes.

255
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,875
Let's go see.

256
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,250
Let's go see Mommy.

257
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:32,640
Mommy shouldn't leave you alone.
That just won't do.

258
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:35,292
Mommy shouldn't leave you alone.
That just won't do.

259
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,375
Baby problema.

260
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:38,400
Hello!

261
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,000
Hello!

262
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,333
Baby problem.

263
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,125
You no have a grandma?

264
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,917
- What can I say?
- No?

265
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:45,292
What?

266
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:47,000
You no understand.

267
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,500
Let me work.

268
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,439
<i>From the bushes water drips</i>

269
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:01,875
<i>From the bushes water drips</i>

270
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:04,625
<i>Negro mamas smack their lips</i>

271
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,199
<i>And those hairy Negro butts</i>

272
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,280
<i>And those hairy Negro butts</i>

273
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,958
<i>In a funeral march do strut</i>

274
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:12,960
<i>I need you</i>

275
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
<i>I need you</i>

276
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,667
<i>I need you so</i>

277
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:18,720
<i>I need</i>

278
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
<i>I need</i>

279
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,000
<i>you</i>

280
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,667
Wait inside. Don't wander off.

281
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,799
Take your luggage.

282
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,458
Take your luggage.

283
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,750
That's it.

284
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,250
Do you have yours?

285
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:21,417
Hello!

286
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:24,375
Hey Richie!

287
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,292
Nice to see you!

288
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,625
Cats and dogs!
It's hydrotherapy.

289
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:33,600
What a pleasure!

290
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:34,625
What a pleasure!

291
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,625
Everything OK?

292
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
See you soon.

293
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,359
- Hi Richie.
- Hi there.

294
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,125
- Hi Richie.
- Hi there.

295
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,625
Good to see you!

296
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,375
- Rotten weather.
- Vile.

297
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,119
But our hearts are warm.
See you.

298
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,400
But our hearts are warm.
See you.

299
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:53,792
Perfect.

300
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,125
Maybe...

301
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:56,640
A bit, a bit down, OK?

302
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,500
A bit, a bit down, OK?

303
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:02,398
Perfect.

304
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:03,292
Perfect.

305
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:05,542
Not much time, huh?

306
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,159
The ladies await.

307
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,160
The ladies await.

308
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:11,042
So...

309
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,458
CD 1.

310
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:13,920
CD 2.

311
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:15,167
CD 2.

312
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:19,679
<i>Since the sun no longer
shines for us, chérie</i>

313
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,351
<i>Since the sun no longer
shines for us, chérie</i>

314
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:25,000
<i>And our love has endured a thousand tears</i>

315
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,542
My jacket.

316
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:46,292
Perfect.

317
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:57,292
No, no. That's fine.

318
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:11,375
Buona sera!

319
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:15,000
I'm truly delighted, ladies and gentlemen,

320
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,279
that I can be here this evening.

321
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:17,375
That I can be here this evening.

322
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:21,083
I'm thrilled so many of you have come.

323
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,039
Did you have a good trip?

324
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,042
Did you have a good trip?

325
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:25,250
Have you gone swimming already?

326
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,000
The weather's shi...

327
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,500
charming!

328
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:28,800
But at least you can cuddle up together.

329
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:32,000
But at least you can cuddle up together.

330
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:34,559
Did you know that 60% of couples

331
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,840
Did you know that 60% of couples

332
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,167
have miraculous sex?

333
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,319
They do, really.

334
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:40,542
They do, really.

335
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:44,042
Monday, it'd be a miracle.
Tuesday, a miracle...

336
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:46,000
You heard that one before.

337
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:48,250
I see it on your face, madame.

338
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,250
Anyway...

339
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:51,250
So it doesn't apply to us...

340
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:51,840
And when I look at you, I'm sure it won't!

341
00:24:51,841 --> 00:24:54,917
And when I look at you, I'm sure it won't!

342
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:57,599
Let's hold on to love.
To amore.

343
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,643
Let's hold on to love.
To amore.

344
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:00,792
For which Italy is so famous.

345
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Especially

346
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:03,360
for you!

347
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:03,750
For you!

348
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:04,875
Here goes!

349
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:07,000
Insieme con te, Mario, please!

350
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:31,375
<i>When I look at you, I see exactly</i>

351
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:36,292
<i>What I found in you</i>

352
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:40,500
<i>You mean everything to me</i>

353
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:42,667
<i>And how wonderful it is</i>

354
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:43,680
<i>That we two are lovers</i>

355
00:25:43,681 --> 00:25:47,375
<i>That we two are lovers</i>

356
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,439
<i>Have I ever told you</i>

357
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
<i>Have I ever told you</i>

358
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,199
<i>That I've never loved anyone like this?</i>

359
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,760
<i>That I've never loved anyone like this?</i>

360
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:59,042
<i>Yes, I sense that you feel it</i>

361
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:00,959
<i>Exactly as I do</i>

362
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
<i>Exactly as I do</i>

363
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,958
<i>That we belong together, you and I</i>

364
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:06,720
<i>Together with you</i>

365
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:09,000
<i>Together with you</i>

366
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:12,479
<i>I want to go to the end of the world</i>

367
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,167
<i>I want to go to the end of the world</i>

368
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:18,239
<i>Together with you</i>

369
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,240
<i>Together with you</i>

370
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:23,000
<i>I dream dreams of gold</i>

371
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:27,542
<i>Together with you</i>

372
00:26:29,042 --> 00:26:29,760
<i>I want to be, till the end of time</i>

373
00:26:29,761 --> 00:26:33,167
<i>I want to be, till the end of time</i>

374
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,519
<i>Together with you</i>

375
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,625
<i>Together with you</i>

376
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:41,279
<i>I want to be with you alone</i>

377
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,750
<i>I want to be with you alone</i>

378
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:44,042
Jealousy will get you nowhere.

379
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:00,625
You inspire me.

380
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:04,319
<i>When I feel you by me,
everything grows warm</i>

381
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,018
<i>When I feel you by me,
everything grows warm</i>

382
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:10,000
<i>Then we are infinitely close</i>

383
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:13,500
<i>When our eyes meet</i>

384
00:27:13,917 --> 00:27:15,792
<i>There's only you and me</i>

385
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,417
<i>And we sink into the arms of the night</i>

386
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:55,875
Here I am!

387
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:01,919
That's an animal.

388
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,920
That's an animal.

389
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,750
Is it a real animal?

390
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,375
It's sealskin.

391
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:07,680
Are you a real animal too?

392
00:28:07,681 --> 00:28:09,083
Are you a real animal too?

393
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:17,167
Horny bitch.

394
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:18,625
Fuck me!

Wait a sec. Wait.

397

It's alright.

398
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
It's alright.

399
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,875
- Should I stay down?
- Hold it.

400
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,720
- Down low?
- Hold it.

401
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:31,750
- Down low?
- Hold it.

402
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,250
Shit.

403
00:28:33,292 --> 00:28:34,875
Or I'll come too fast.

404
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,479
- Yeah.
- You're so hot!

405
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,500
- Yeah.

406
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:38,750
Wait. Don't come.

407
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:40,125
I'm about to come.

408
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,500
Stay down.

409
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,500
Here.

410
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:47,667
I was just at the ATM.

411
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:49,875
Here's one.

412
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:52,500
You're a sweetheart. Thank you!

413
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:58,750
It's all I've got.
I'll have to go back.

414
00:28:58,875 --> 00:28:59,520
Did I rob you clean?

415
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,520
Did I rob you clean?

416
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,542
You gave me something in return.

417
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:10,875
You tiger!

418
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,542
See you again.

419
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,750
Do you know how sexy you are?

420
00:29:15,792 --> 00:29:16,792
Really?

421
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000

Put it down.

449
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:15,359
Just leave all that here.

It's not a problem. But
if there's no work...

Do you want the 200?

Careful, you'll fall off!

549
00:39:27,361 --> 00:39:28,417
Careful, you'll fall off!

550
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:29,875
Careful!

551
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,958

00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:57,167
Dolce vita!

567
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:13,250
Don't say anything.
I just want you to...

568
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:17,125
to say yes so that I can say no.

569
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:05,279
Mi amore, I love hearing your beautiful
voice on the answering machine,

570
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,643
Mi amore, I love hearing your beautiful
voice on the answering machine,

571
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:09,750
but I prefer speaking to you in person.

572
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:11,040
Yeah.

573
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,667
Yeah.

574
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:13,875
Please call me back, OK?

575
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:16,799
It's your Richie, grazie.

576
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,250
It's your Richie, grazie.

577
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:21,500
Stupid cow.

578
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,500
Ciao, dottore.

579
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:43,199
Can I have a grappa,

580
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,250
Can I have a grappa,

581
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,250
a chiara bianca and an espresso?

582
00:42:47,792 --> 00:42:48,917
Thanks.

583
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,917
- Got that?
- Absolutely.

584
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:11,750
Look at me.

585
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:13,375
Yeah?

586
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:14,917
With pleasure.

587
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:16,708
Do you recognize me?

588
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:17,760
No, I saw you once.

589
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,125
No, I saw you once.

590
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:21,167
Love at first sight.

591
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:22,875
But...

592
00:43:22,917 --> 00:43:23,520
Good to know.
I'm your child.

593
00:43:23,521 --> 00:43:24,917
Good to know.
I'm your child.

594
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:26,208
Sure...

595
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:29,279
All beautiful women are
Richie Bravo's children. It's a fact.

596
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,559
All beautiful women are
Richie Bravo's children. It's a fact.

597
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:33,125
- Like a drink?
- You haven't changed.

598
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:35,040
- You don't...
- I'm Tessa.

599
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,080
- You don't...
- I'm Tessa.

600
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,250
- Sorry?
- Hello, I'm your daughter.

601
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:40,800
Nice to meet you, Richie Bravo.

602
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:42,875
Nice to meet you, Richie Bravo.

603
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,125
Slow down. Slow down.

604
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,375
Yup, 18 years.

605
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:51,042
What?

606
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:52,320
Wait...

607
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,320
Wait...

608
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:55,000
I just had a flash.

609
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,080
You're Tessa?

610
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:58,500
You're Tessa?

611
00:43:58,625 --> 00:43:59,792
Yeah, I'm Tessa.

612
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:09,167
- I'm in shock.
- Yeah, and I'm speechless.

613
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:13,333
Sorry. It's been so long
since I've seen you.

614
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:16,667
Are you...

615
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,375
What are you doing here?
Did you just...

616
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,750
I came to see you.

617
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:22,625
And I found you.

618
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:26,292
Sorry, let me look at you.

619
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,250
You look like your mom.

620
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,750
You should know.

621
00:44:31,917 --> 00:44:32,640
Please don't.

622
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,640
Please don't.

623
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:38,125
Where do I begin?

624
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:42,500
I only want what

625
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:44,160
I'm entitled to.

626
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:44,875
I'm entitled to.

627
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,667
What you didn't pay for 18 years

628
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:49,919
and robbed my mother of,
and me too.

629
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,250
And robbed my mother of,
and me too.

630
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:52,708
- You mean money?
- Yeah, money.

631
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:16,319
You fucker!

632
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,320
You fucker!

633
00:46:18,917 --> 00:46:19,917
I'm Richie!

634
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,000
I'm Richie Bravo!

635
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,792
Hello.

636
00:48:10,917 --> 00:48:11,520
The prodigal daughter.

637
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:12,667
The prodigal daughter.

638
00:48:13,042 --> 00:48:14,500
Been to the ATM?

639
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,279
I've been to the ATM many times.

640
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:17,833
I've been to the ATM many times.

641
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,500
I have a problem,
I need more time.

642
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,000
How much more?

643
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:23,040
More time?

644
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:23,333
More time?

645
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:25,625
I can't say exactly.

646
00:48:25,792 --> 00:48:28,792
I may have to pay in installments.

647
00:48:28,917 --> 00:48:32,375
Paying in installments is
out of the question. Please.

648
00:48:32,667 --> 00:48:34,559
This is the only favor
I've ever asked you. Please.

649
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,476
This is the only favor
I've ever asked you. Please.

650
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,667
I'd do every favor in the world for you.

651
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:40,320
The problem is,

652
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,320
The problem is,

653
00:48:41,792 --> 00:48:45,167
I need to put this together.
I need a little time.

654
00:48:45,292 --> 00:48:46,080
- I can pay you...
- How many years will it take?

655
00:48:46,081 --> 00:48:48,375
- I can pay you...
- How many years will it take?

656
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,839
I can't arrange it overnight.
You all imagine that, I dunno...

657
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,375
I can't arrange it overnight.
You all imagine that, I dunno...

658
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,250
"Us all?" Who's us?

659
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:57,542
You kids.
You think it can happen overnight.

660
00:48:58,542 --> 00:49:00,833
Mom's waiting for it.
I'm waiting.

661
00:49:01,542 --> 00:49:03,359
We agreed that I'd get it.

662
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:03,542
We agreed that I'd get it.

663
00:49:03,667 --> 00:49:06,750
You'll get it.
Now come have a drink with me.

664
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:09,119
- Let's have a real conversation.
- I don't want a drink!

665
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,976
- Let's have a real conversation.
- I don't want a drink!

666
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,375
I want all those years back.

667
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,879
I want what I could never have.
Understand?

668
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,000
I want what I could never have.
Understand?

669
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:20,375
- Fine.
- A car. A car for my birthday.

670
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:20,640
An apartment.

671
00:49:20,641 --> 00:49:21,875
An apartment.

672
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:24,667
- My driver's license.
- I hear you.

673
00:49:24,792 --> 00:49:26,125
Private lessons.

674
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:26,400
I hear you.

675
00:49:26,401 --> 00:49:27,542
I hear you.

676
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:29,542
But I can't.

677
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:32,159
I can't make it rain down
like manna from heaven.

678
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,476
I can't make it rain down
like manna from heaven.

679
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,500
I need...

680
00:49:35,292 --> 00:49:37,417
a few days. Maybe a few weeks.

681
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:37,920
- Give me some time.
- No problem.

682
00:49:37,921 --> 00:49:40,125
- Give me some time.
- No problem.

683
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:42,750
But you'll cover my stay here, agreed?

684
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:45,625
Later, yeah.

685
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,417
I have to organize things.

686
00:49:47,542 --> 00:49:49,292
What do you do all day?

687
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:52,125
Besides boozing it up in there?

688
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:55,199
I work. There's a difference
between having a beer...

689
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:55,917
I work. There's a difference
between having a beer...

690
00:49:56,042 --> 00:49:59,125
- One beer? One?
- and coming up with 30,000!

691
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,959
You have one beer?

692
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,000
You have one beer?

693
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:04,750
Yeah.
Why, do you think I'm a drunk?

694
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:06,125
I know you are.

695
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:06,720
Interesting. How do you know that?

696
00:50:06,721 --> 00:50:08,875
Interesting. How do you know that?

697
00:50:09,542 --> 00:50:11,292
I've been watching you.

698
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:12,480
- Nothing's changed, like always.
- Sure.

699
00:50:12,481 --> 00:50:14,750
- Nothing's changed, like always.
- Sure.

700
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:17,292
"I'll stop smoking, stop drinking."

701
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:18,240
I'm sorry, but what I do
in my private life...

702
00:50:18,241 --> 00:50:20,625
I'm sorry, but what I do
in my private life...

703
00:50:21,417 --> 00:50:24,000
Your private life?
Aren't I part of your life?

704
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:25,667
- Tessa!
- Aren't I?

705
00:50:25,792 --> 00:50:28,125
Tessa, of course you are.

706
00:50:28,292 --> 00:50:29,759
But you weren't in my life for...

707
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,542
But you weren't in my life for...

708
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:32,875
- 12 years...
- Is that my fault?

709
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,125
Of course not, Tessa.

710
00:50:35,792 --> 00:50:39,833
But it's not all my fault either.
I'd like a chance to explain.

711
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:41,279
You can't blame someone
without knowing what else was going on.

712
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,667
You can't blame someone
without knowing what else was going on.

713
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,039
- I'm so tired of your excuses.
- Listen.

714
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,101
- I'm so tired of your excuses.
- Listen.

715
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:49,917
- No.
- Just listen.

716
00:50:50,042 --> 00:50:52,583
Already when I was a kid...

717
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:52,800
You'd take me for a walk,
everything was tralala...

718
00:50:52,801 --> 00:50:56,167
You'd take me for a walk,
everything was tralala...

719
00:50:56,292 --> 00:50:58,375
It was funny. Everything was fun.

720
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:58,560
Blaming me doesn't help.

721
00:50:58,561 --> 00:51:00,958
Blaming me doesn't help.

722
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:02,917
If I somehow get it earlier,

723
00:51:03,042 --> 00:51:04,319
I'll call you earlier.

724
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:04,708
I'll call you earlier.

725
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:07,125
- And in return I want...
- What?

726
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:09,125
For us to talk, reasonably.

727
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,080
Agreed.

728
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:10,417
Agreed.

729
00:51:10,917 --> 00:51:12,375
- Deal?
- Agreed.

730
00:51:13,125 --> 00:51:14,750
The day I get it.

731
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:18,000
Don't bother.

732
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:19,250
Don't, thanks.

733
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:20,375
Don't bother.

734
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,125
Who is that?

735
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:26,250
My boyfriend.

736
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:38,000
I'd like to remind you,
ladies and gentlemen...

737
00:51:38,292 --> 00:51:38,880
that we sometimes quarrel,
we can be bad-tempered.

738
00:51:38,881 --> 00:51:41,625
That we sometimes quarrel,
we can be bad-tempered.

739
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,042
We may even lose ourselves.

740
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:44,640
Out of sight, out of mind.

741
00:51:44,641 --> 00:51:46,292
Out of sight, out of mind.

742
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:48,417
And we suffer from it.

743
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:50,400
And with my next song,

744
00:51:50,401 --> 00:51:52,250
And with my next song,

745
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:55,042
I'd like to plant a little hope

746
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:56,160
in your hearts.

747
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,160
In your hearts.

748
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,250
For this

749
00:51:58,625 --> 00:52:01,000
isn't really The End of the Night.

750
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,500
<i>Already at dawn</i>

751
00:52:19,042 --> 00:52:19,200
<i>The siren blares in my head</i>

752
00:52:19,201 --> 00:52:21,917
<i>The siren blares in my head</i>

753
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,959
<i>A glass of wine or two</i>

754
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:25,960
<i>A glass of wine or two</i>

755
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:30,292
<i>Drowns the longing for her</i>

756
00:52:31,917 --> 00:52:34,625
<i>Later in the night</i>

757
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:36,480
<i>The stranger was there</i>

758
00:52:36,481 --> 00:52:39,208
<i>The stranger was there</i>

759
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:42,239
<i>Next to her at the bar</i>

760
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,240
<i>Next to her at the bar</i>

761
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:46,375
<i>And it hurt so bad</i>

762
00:52:49,042 --> 00:52:52,000
<i>That was the beginning of the night</i>

763
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:53,760
<i>It was the end of my life</i>

764
00:52:53,761 --> 00:52:56,000
<i>It was the end of my life</i>

765
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,519
<i>How could I live without her?</i>

766
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,750
<i>How could I live without her?</i>

767
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:37,375
Hey!

768
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,292
You broke into your own home?

769
00:54:40,417 --> 00:54:41,750
Looks like it!

770
00:54:42,167 --> 00:54:43,199
I thought you'd be out. Sorry.

771
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,417
I thought you'd be out. Sorry.

772
00:54:44,542 --> 00:54:47,917
Walter plays golf,
but I'm here most of the time.

773
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:48,960
I'm so happy to be here.
And all by myself, too!

774
00:54:48,961 --> 00:54:51,833
I'm so happy to be here.
And all by myself, too!

775
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:53,042
Madame.

776
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:54,720
Especially...

777
00:54:54,721 --> 00:54:55,917
Especially...

778
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:57,625
for you.

779
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:00,479
- Grazie.
- Like a waiter.

780
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,480
- Grazie.
- Like a waiter.

781
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:06,042
What a lovely surprise!

782
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,917
Villa Bravo!

783
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,500
Romantica.

784
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:11,999
My favorite time's when I'm alone
and I can prowl around.

785
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,625
My favorite time's when I'm alone
and I can prowl around.

786
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:15,792
I just...

787
00:55:15,917 --> 00:55:17,759
Here, you sing,
and I'll come in on the chorus.

788
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,268
Here, you sing,
and I'll come in on the chorus.

789
00:55:19,292 --> 00:55:20,375
Good!
OK?

790
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,500
So, I'm ready. Here goes!

791
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,520
Super. Go ahead.
1, 2, 3...

792
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:25,375
Super. Go ahead.
1, 2, 3...

793
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,500
<i>Emilia</i>

794
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,279
<i>my heart is lost</i>

795
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,375
<i>my heart is lost</i>

796
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:32,292
<i>Emilia</i>

797
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:35,039
<i>can't you hear me?</i>

798
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,040
<i>Can't you hear me?</i>

799
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:39,250
<i>Since I saw you</i>

800
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:40,800
<i>The bells keep ringing</i>

801
00:55:40,801 --> 00:55:42,875
<i>The bells keep ringing</i>

802
00:55:43,625 --> 00:55:45,042
<i>Emilia</i>

803
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:46,560
<i>Whatever have you done?</i>

804
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:48,292
<i>Whatever have you done?</i>

805
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,792
Wait, I'll just...

806
00:55:55,625 --> 00:55:56,625
You, too!

807
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58,079
<i>Emilia, you've stolen my heart</i>

808
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,750
<i>Emilia, you've stolen my heart</i>

809
00:56:08,542 --> 00:56:09,599
<i>Emilia, my heart</i>

810
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,000
<i>Emilia, my heart</i>

811
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,958
<i>is lost</i>

812
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,708
Come!

813
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:42,750
Yeah.

814
00:56:45,292 --> 00:56:46,625
I'll give you...

815
00:56:48,167 --> 00:56:49,250
300 euros.

816
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:49,920
300? No way.

817
00:56:49,921 --> 00:56:51,500
300? No way.

818
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,679
I'm sorry, but I can't pay more.

819
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:55,750
I'm sorry, but I can't pay more.

820
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:57,750
- If you want 300...
- 800.

821
00:56:57,917 --> 00:56:59,375
- No.
- 800 is...

822
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,440
- minimum.
- I don't deal in this stuff.

823
00:57:01,441 --> 00:57:03,125
- Minimum.
- I don't deal in this stuff.

824
00:57:03,875 --> 00:57:05,250
If you want, here's

825
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:06,375
200...

826
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:09,625
300 euros.

827
00:57:09,917 --> 00:57:10,917
400.

828
00:57:12,292 --> 00:57:12,960
If you want, there's 300 euros.

829
00:57:12,961 --> 00:57:14,750
If you want, there's 300 euros.

830
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:17,750
Or keep your stuff.

831
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:18,720
I'm not really interested.

832
00:57:18,721 --> 00:57:19,875
I'm not really interested.

833
00:57:20,167 --> 00:57:21,375
Here's 300.

834
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:23,875
To help you out.

835
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:04,542
Could you please get Tessa?

836
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:04,800
Do you finally have it?
Took a while.

837
00:58:04,801 --> 00:58:07,125
Do you finally have it?
Took a while.

838
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,250
Finally?

839
00:58:08,292 --> 00:58:10,559
We have to talk.
It's not so simple.

840
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,042
We have to talk.
It's not so simple.

841
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:15,250
It's turning out to be harder
than I expected.

842
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:16,320
- Let's go warm up.
- Still no money?

843
00:58:16,321 --> 00:58:17,875
- Let's go warm up.
- Still no money?

844
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,667
Sure, but come talk.

845
00:58:19,792 --> 00:58:22,079
I don't want to go anywhere.
It's cold. We can talk there a second.

846
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,226
I don't want to go anywhere.
It's cold. We can talk there a second.

847
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,375
It's cold here.

848
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,125
Is back there a problem?

849
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:27,840
- Fine.
- Is that OK?

850
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,840
- Fine.
- Is that OK?

851
00:58:28,875 --> 00:58:31,500
- You have to ask him?
- I want to ask him.

852
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:33,600
You live here?

853
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,125
You live here?

854
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,375
Looks like it.

855
00:58:36,083 --> 00:58:37,917
Since Daddy hasn't paid.

856
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,667
Tell me, do you love the guy?

857
00:58:47,792 --> 00:58:49,750
It's none of your business.

858
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:50,880
You keep saying that, but...

859
00:58:50,881 --> 00:58:52,125
You keep saying that, but...

860
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:54,000
There's nothing to discuss.

861
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:56,125
You want me to give you cash

862
00:58:56,292 --> 00:58:56,640
and help you out of your jam,
and I will, but...

863
00:58:56,641 --> 00:58:59,500
and help you out of your jam,
and I will, but...

864
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:02,399
"Get me out of a jam?"
It's money I'm entitled to.

865
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:02,750
"Get me out of a jam?"
It's money I'm entitled to.

866
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:05,167
Then you have to help me, y'know?

867
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:08,125
Why should I help you?
Did you once help me?

868
00:59:08,667 --> 00:59:11,583
It's money that you owe us, Mom and me.

869
00:59:11,708 --> 00:59:13,919
There are things that can happen,

870
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:14,125
There are things that can happen,

871
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:17,417
if you're in Syria, say, or in...

872
00:59:17,542 --> 00:59:19,679
I dunno, Iraq or Iran or, I dunno...

873
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,125
I dunno, Iraq or Iran or, I dunno...

874
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,000
Sure.

875
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:22,375
As the 16th

876
00:59:23,208 --> 00:59:24,625
wife in the harem.

877
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:25,440
You vanish and no one
hears from you again.

878
00:59:25,441 --> 00:59:27,875
You vanish and no one
hears from you again.

879
00:59:28,292 --> 00:59:30,625
I'm not saying he's like that.

880
00:59:31,042 --> 00:59:31,200
I'm not a racist.
I care about everyone.

881
00:59:31,201 --> 00:59:34,167
I'm not a racist.
I care about everyone.

882
00:59:34,292 --> 00:59:35,875
Did you care about me?

883
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:36,960
About where I was?
What I was doing?

884
00:59:36,961 --> 00:59:38,375
About where I was?
What I was doing?

885
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,042
You don't give a shit if I go to Syria.

886
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,719
- No way!
- Not till now.

887
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:42,750
- No way!
- Not till now.

888
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,250
And I apologized.
I keep apologizing.

889
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:47,792
Fuck your apologies.

890
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:48,480
I've heard them since I was this big.

891
00:59:48,481 --> 00:59:50,542
I've heard them since I was this big.

892
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:53,500
- This is no...
- All I ever heard was Sorry.

893
00:59:53,625 --> 00:59:54,240
This is no way for us to talk.

894
00:59:54,241 --> 00:59:55,833
This is no way for us to talk.

895
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:57,333
I don't want to talk.

896
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:59,042
Want me to kneel down?

897
00:59:59,167 --> 01:00:00,000
For starters.

898
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
For starters.

899
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:04,875
Show me what you can do, old man!

900
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,167
If it helps you.

901
01:00:08,292 --> 01:00:09,625
And if it helps me.

902
01:00:10,542 --> 01:00:11,520
So together
we can build something new.

903
01:00:11,521 --> 01:00:13,292
So together
we can build something new.

904
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:16,875
I don't want to build.
I want you to be sorry.

905
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:17,280
- For what you did to me.
- I am.

906
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:19,167
- For what you did to me.
- I am.

907
01:00:19,292 --> 01:00:20,292
I've...

908
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,500
- I'm so sorry.
- Understand?

909
01:00:23,417 --> 01:00:25,125
- Deeply sorry.
- I want...

910
01:00:25,417 --> 01:00:26,417
a future.

911
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,799
First we'd have to
get to know each other.

912
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,167
First we'd have to
get to know each other.

913
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,042
- Exactly.
- Fuck singing!

914
01:00:31,167 --> 01:00:34,125
- I don't want to be Riccarda Bravo.
- You won't.

915
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:34,560
I don't want your life.

916
01:00:34,561 --> 01:00:35,875
I don't want your life.

917
01:00:36,042 --> 01:00:37,500
You have your own.

918
01:00:37,792 --> 01:00:39,750
I want you to show remorse.

919
01:00:40,667 --> 01:00:42,750
Your daughter is asking you.

920
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,042
Richie Bravo is on his knees.

921
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:37,919
You're the best audience I ever had.

922
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:38,417
You're the best audience I ever had.

923
01:01:38,542 --> 01:01:40,208
I say that every time.

924
01:01:40,333 --> 01:01:41,333
So...

925
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:42,375
Good.

926
01:01:43,542 --> 01:01:43,680
Ladies and gentlemen,

927
01:01:43,681 --> 01:01:45,083
Ladies and gentlemen,

928
01:01:45,542 --> 01:01:46,792
Dear friends...

929
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:48,250
the next song...

930
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:49,375
Girlfriends!

931
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,875
Something upbeat.

932
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:53,250
Shall we do Piacere?

933
01:01:53,667 --> 01:01:54,667
For you.

934
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:03,292
This is Amore mio.

935
01:02:03,542 --> 01:02:04,667
Doesn't matter.

936
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:12,479
<i>If you worry it's all too late</i>

937
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,680
<i>If you worry it's all too late</i>

938
01:02:14,125 --> 01:02:17,750
<i>If you think you're alone with your fate</i>

939
01:02:19,042 --> 01:02:22,750
<i>If your heart holds you in its grip</i>

940
01:02:23,417 --> 01:02:24,000
<i>I'll be at your side</i>

941
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:26,125
<i>I'll be at your side</i>

942
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:29,760
<i>If you think every dream's been dreamt</i>

943
01:02:29,761 --> 01:02:32,625
<i>If you think every dream's been dreamt</i>

944
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,519
<i>And that every path leads nowhere</i>

945
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,500
<i>And that every path leads nowhere</i>

946
01:02:38,792 --> 01:02:41,279
<i>If you can barely feel</i>
your heart beat anymore

947
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,080
<i>If you can barely feel</i>
your heart beat anymore

948
01:02:43,417 --> 01:02:45,667
<i>I'll be at your side</i>

949
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:51,375
<i>Amore mio</i>

950
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:52,800
<i>Amore mio, amore amor</i>

951
01:02:52,801 --> 01:02:56,042
<i>Amore mio, amore amor</i>

952
01:02:58,042 --> 01:02:58,560
<i>Amore mio</i>

953
01:02:58,561 --> 01:03:01,000
<i>Amore mio</i>

954
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:04,319
<i>Amore mio, amor</i>

955
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,667
<i>Amore mio, amor</i>

956
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,375
- Your cunt!
- Anna!

957
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:21,600
- Your beautiful cunt!
- Anna!

958
01:03:21,601 --> 01:03:23,417
- Your beautiful cunt!
- Anna!

959
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:25,000
Your sacred hole!

960
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:27,360
Wait.

961
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:27,417
Wait.

962
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,500
What? What is it?

963
01:03:29,625 --> 01:03:30,625
Wait.

964
01:03:38,417 --> 01:03:38,880
Hot water bottle.

965
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:39,880
Hot water bottle.

966
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:47,500
There.

967
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:56,160
I checked my cell.

968
01:03:56,161 --> 01:03:57,625
I checked my cell.

969
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:01,920
Sorry.

970
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:02,920
Sorry.

971
01:04:04,417 --> 01:04:05,500
All done.

972
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,679
- Richie...
- It's all good.

973
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:08,125
- Richie...
- It's all good.

974
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:10,125
C'mere, come...

975
01:04:10,792 --> 01:04:12,625
Let's keep going.

976
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:13,440
C'mere.

977
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,440
C'mere.

978
01:04:20,083 --> 01:04:21,417
That's so good.

979
01:04:23,875 --> 01:04:24,959
That's it, you dirty slut!

980
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,625
That's it, you dirty slut!

981
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:27,292
Suck it, you dirty slut.

982
01:04:32,292 --> 01:04:33,583
Come. C'mere.

983
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:34,917
Put it in.

984
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:37,875
You dirty slut.

985
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,042
Yeah, dominate me.

986
01:04:41,167 --> 01:04:42,239
Come on, dominate me.

987
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:42,917
Come on, dominate me.

988
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:44,500
Come on!

989
01:04:45,292 --> 01:04:46,292
Hurt me.

990
01:04:50,667 --> 01:04:52,125
Stop, stop, stop.

991
01:04:52,792 --> 01:04:53,760
I'm really sorry.

992
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:54,760
I'm really sorry.

993
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:57,250
I give up.

994
01:05:03,875 --> 01:05:04,875
C'mere.

995
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:08,750
I can't do this.

996
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:09,917
I'm done!

997
01:05:10,042 --> 01:05:11,040
It's a weird situation. I'm sorry.

998
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:12,667
It's a weird situation. I'm sorry.

999
01:05:12,792 --> 01:05:14,000
Yeah, I know.

1000
01:05:15,125 --> 01:05:16,125
Richie...

1001
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:18,333
- Richie?
- What?

1002
01:05:18,875 --> 01:05:19,875
Get up.

1003
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,125
What's wrong?

1004
01:05:24,542 --> 01:05:26,375
I can't do this today.

1005
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:28,250
I'm sorry.

1006
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:34,079
It's OK. You don't have to...

1007
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,240
It's OK. You don't have to...

1008
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:42,875
I must be under the weather.

1009
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:45,599
No idea. But it has nothing to do with you.

1010
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,583
No idea. But it has nothing to do with you.

1011
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:53,500
It's never the woman's fault.

1012
01:05:54,375 --> 01:05:55,375
Stop.

1013
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:06,875
You're beautiful.

1014
01:06:07,167 --> 01:06:08,167
Please go.

1015
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:24,750
Mom?

1016
01:07:34,042 --> 01:07:35,040
Want some?

1017
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,040
Want some?

1018
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:14,792
Can you come out?

1019
01:09:22,042 --> 01:09:23,042
Yeah?

1020
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:24,480
As a sign of good will,

1021
01:09:24,481 --> 01:09:25,625
As a sign of good will,

1022
01:09:26,417 --> 01:09:28,250
I'll hear you out.

1023
01:09:29,167 --> 01:09:30,239
You'll hear me out?
Now, suddenly?

1024
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,393
You'll hear me out?
Now, suddenly?

1025
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:32,750
Think it's funny?

1026
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:36,000
No, it's not funny.
It's really sweet of you.

1027
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:39,375
I'm just, I dunno, upset.

1028
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,759
That nice fellow's standing there,
staring like he wants to kill me.

1029
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,018
That nice fellow's standing there,
staring like he wants to kill me.

1030
01:09:44,042 --> 01:09:45,792
What do you want to say?

1031
01:09:46,042 --> 01:09:47,519
Tessa, there's so much I want to tell you.
I can't just...

1032
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,167
Tessa, there's so much I want to tell you.
I can't just...

1033
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:52,125
Sweetheart... Sweetie.

1034
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:53,280
I can't tell you in just...

1035
01:09:53,281 --> 01:09:55,000
I can't tell you in just...

1036
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:57,250
Tessa, Tessa...

1037
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,040
I can't explain it all
in five minutes here on the beach.

1038
01:09:59,041 --> 01:10:02,667
I can't explain it all
in five minutes here on the beach.

1039
01:10:02,792 --> 01:10:04,458
I can't, it's impossible.

1040
01:10:05,708 --> 01:10:08,542
I know that I owe you a lot.

1041
01:10:10,333 --> 01:10:10,560
Y'know?

1042
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,167
Y'know?

1043
01:10:11,417 --> 01:10:12,417
But...

1044
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:13,792
But I...

1045
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:16,320
I can't do this on an ice-cold beach.
I have...

1046
01:10:16,321 --> 01:10:19,125
I can't do this on an ice-cold beach.
I have...

1047
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:22,079
There's so much I have to explain.

1048
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:22,417
There's so much I have to explain.

1049
01:10:22,917 --> 01:10:23,917
I...

1050
01:10:28,167 --> 01:10:29,417
I...

1051
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,250
- What...
- I thought of you often.

1052
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:33,599
What's there to explain?

1053
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,600
What's there to explain?

1054
01:10:36,417 --> 01:10:37,417
There's...

1055
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:39,359
- lot's to explain.
- You weren't there.

1056
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,726
- Lot's to explain.
- You weren't there.

1057
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:42,000
Wasn't what?

1058
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:44,667
You weren't there. You aren't now.

1059
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:47,417
I had to come looking for you.

1060
01:10:52,417 --> 01:10:56,500
This can't be settled in five minutes,
Tessa.

1061
01:10:57,125 --> 01:10:58,125
It's...

1062
01:11:00,625 --> 01:11:02,399
It's more than half your life.

1063
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,600
It's more than half your life.

1064
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:05,750
More than half your life.

1065
01:11:08,125 --> 01:11:08,160
My entire life.
But that's OK.

1066
01:11:08,161 --> 01:11:10,500
My entire life.
But that's OK.

1067
01:11:12,417 --> 01:11:13,919
I loved your mom.

1068
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:14,000
I loved your mom.

1069
01:11:14,292 --> 01:11:18,000
Sure! I'm happy you loved Mom,
at least.

1070
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:19,679
Tessa, I...

1071
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:20,680
Tessa, I...

1072
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:22,917
I was there when you were born.

1073
01:11:23,417 --> 01:11:24,792
I know. Wasted.

1074
01:11:27,542 --> 01:11:29,292
It's not easy for a man.

1075
01:11:29,417 --> 01:11:30,417
Right!

1076
01:11:30,667 --> 01:11:31,200
Your kid's born and you're wasted.

1077
01:11:31,201 --> 01:11:32,917
Your kid's born and you're wasted.

1078
01:11:33,042 --> 01:11:36,625
My blood pressure was
higher than your mom's.

1079
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
But she couldn't drink.

1080
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,917
You've grown so beautiful.

1081
01:11:47,917 --> 01:11:48,480
Don't know what to say.

1082
01:11:48,481 --> 01:11:49,500
Don't know what to say.

1083
01:11:49,625 --> 01:11:51,250
You look like her.

1084
01:11:54,208 --> 01:11:54,240
Answer me. I just want an answer.

1085
01:11:54,241 --> 01:11:56,583
Answer me. I just want an answer.

1086
01:11:57,125 --> 01:11:58,500
What can we do?

1087
01:11:59,708 --> 01:12:00,000
Why...

1088
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,542
Why...

1089
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:04,833
At least show me that
you're somehow helping

1090
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:05,760
to support me in my life, you know?

1091
01:12:05,761 --> 01:12:07,792
To support me in my life, you know?

1092
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:09,750
- OK.
- Please.

1093
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,519
I will. I promise you that.

1094
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,000
I will. I promise you that.

1095
01:12:12,542 --> 01:12:14,667
- I promise, Tessa.
- It's...

1096
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:17,279
Tessa, I... Look,

1097
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:17,667
Tessa, I... Look,

1098
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:22,125
I know I can't make things right
with money.

1099
01:12:22,792 --> 01:12:23,040
But at least I can show you that I...

1100
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:26,667
But at least I can show you that I...

1101
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,799

It can't be Rumpelstiltskin.

1217

Is Rumpelstiltskin your name?

Perfect!

Gimme a break!

1242

God, what now?

1243
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:07,200
Right behind me.

1244
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,000
Right behind me.

1245
01:21:08,125 --> 01:21:09,125
Slowly.

1246
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:12,125
He's abducting us in the basement.

1247
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:12,960
You guessed it, in the basement!

1248
01:21:12,961 --> 01:21:15,125
You guessed it, in the basement!

1249
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:16,792
You'll lock us up.

1250
01:21:16,917 --> 01:21:18,458
Fun in the basement!

1251
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:18,720
I'm completely wasted.

1252
01:21:18,721 --> 01:21:20,417
I'm completely wasted.

1253
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:21,792
I won't make it up.

1254
01:21:21,917 --> 01:21:23,042
Sure you will.

1255
01:21:23,167 --> 01:21:24,479
- I'll push. You'll see.
- Yes, push!

1256
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,920
- I'll push. You'll see.
- Yes, push!

1257
01:21:26,042 --> 01:21:29,375
The hope of a stiff drink works magic.

1258
01:21:29,875 --> 01:21:30,240
So, ladies...

1259
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,240
So, ladies...

1260
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:34,708
What is your pleasure?

1261
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,875
Champagne!

1262
01:21:38,417 --> 01:21:40,042
That's all there is?

1263
01:21:41,375 --> 01:21:41,760
If I know my Emilia...

1264
01:21:41,761 --> 01:21:43,292
If I know my Emilia...

1265
01:21:43,542 --> 01:21:45,417
There's no whiskey.

1266
01:21:45,542 --> 01:21:47,519
Bubby, to toast the end of the world!

1267
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,601
Bubby, to toast the end of the world!

1268
01:21:48,625 --> 01:21:52,292
We could make a bellini, there's juice.

1269
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:53,280
Look at this.

1270
01:21:53,281 --> 01:21:54,375
Look at this.

1271
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,167
Look what I have.

1272
01:21:56,292 --> 01:21:58,958
No, no. The man must do it.

1273
01:21:59,625 --> 01:22:02,000
We could stop here for a sip.

1274
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:04,799
Take a rest. A champagne stop.

1275
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:05,000
Take a rest. A champagne stop.

1276
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:07,625
No champagne stop for us.

1277
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:09,750
No, we'll keep going.

1278
01:22:09,875 --> 01:22:10,560
- That's for old farts.
- A sip on every step!

1279
01:22:10,561 --> 01:22:12,917
- That's for old farts.
- A sip on every step!

1280
01:22:13,042 --> 01:22:15,750
- Another floor?
- A sip on every step!

1281
01:22:15,875 --> 01:22:16,320
I'll still be here in the morning.

1282
01:22:16,321 --> 01:22:18,042
I'll still be here in the morning.

1283
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:21,750
Come on! Stop that.

1284
01:22:21,875 --> 01:22:22,080
You're as fit as a young doe.

1285
01:22:22,081 --> 01:22:24,125
You're as fit as a young doe.

1286
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:27,839
- This is like Mount Everest.
- It's these damn shoes.

1287
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:27,958
- This is like Mount Everest.
- It's these damn shoes.

1288
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:29,375
Finally!

1289
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:30,750
Are we there?

1290
01:22:31,417 --> 01:22:33,599
- This is the suite, is it?
- Could be.

1291
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,726
- This is the suite, is it?
- Could be.

1292
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:37,792
A hair dryer!
We can dry our hair and warm up!

1293
01:22:37,917 --> 01:22:39,359
Turn on the other one,
the lighting's nicer.

1294
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,167
Turn on the other one,
the lighting's nicer.

1295
01:22:41,292 --> 01:22:43,000
Now it's cozy.

1296
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:45,119
Wait, I have to turn this off.

1297
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,417
Wait, I have to turn this off.

1298
01:22:45,542 --> 01:22:46,750
Very nice.

1299
01:22:47,042 --> 01:22:48,750
A slumber party!

1300
01:22:49,292 --> 01:22:50,879
Not the ceiling light. Turn it off!

1301
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,542
Not the ceiling light. Turn it off!

1302
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,167
Isn't this nice?

1303
01:22:54,292 --> 01:22:55,542
Just us three.

1304
01:22:55,667 --> 01:22:56,640
And the dream of love.

1305
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,167
And the dream of love.

1306
01:22:57,292 --> 01:23:00,250
Spread out your fur coat
like you always...

1307
01:23:02,583 --> 01:23:04,125
Sure, of course.

1308
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:06,000
I'll leave you two.

1309
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:08,159
No, no, no, Emilia!

1310
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:08,250
No, no, no, Emilia!

1311
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:11,417
I want to share a secret with you.

1312
01:23:12,167 --> 01:23:13,919
Each of us tells a secret.

1313
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:14,125
Each of us tells a secret.

1314
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,417
You tell one, you tell one,

1315
01:23:16,542 --> 01:23:17,875
I tell you one.

1316
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:19,000
OK.

1317
01:23:19,125 --> 01:23:19,680
You first!

1318
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,042
You first!

1319
01:23:20,167 --> 01:23:21,875
- You go first.
- Me?

1320
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,792
You go first, Richie.

1321
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,292
Alright.

1322
01:23:26,125 --> 01:23:27,333
Don't fall asleep!

1323
01:23:27,875 --> 01:23:30,625
Is this a shrink's couch we're on?

1324
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:31,200
- No, it's...
- Come on, start already.

1325
01:23:31,201 --> 01:23:34,042
- No, it's...
- Come on, start already.

1326
01:23:34,167 --> 01:23:35,750
It's just for fun.

1327
01:23:35,875 --> 01:23:36,959
Here goes. Listen up.

1328
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:37,500
Here goes. Listen up.

1329
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:41,000
I had my first orgasm with my mother.

1330
01:23:41,667 --> 01:23:42,719
Moron! Be serious!

1331
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,917
Moron! Be serious!

1332
01:23:44,042 --> 01:23:46,750
It wasn't that weird.
It just happened.

1333
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:48,479
Just like that?

1334
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:48,542
Just like that?

1335
01:23:48,875 --> 01:23:49,875
My father...

1336
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,125
was away for a while,
and my little brother was in hospital.

1337
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:56,125
I don't want to hear this.

1338
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:59,875
No, you have to listen.

1339
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
It's not some horror story, it's the truth.

1340
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:05,759
To make a long story short...

1341
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:05,875
To make a long story short...

1342
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,792
I was allowed to sleep in my mom's bed.

1343
01:24:10,042 --> 01:24:11,519
And you came? With your mom?

1344
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,125
And you came? With your mom?

1345
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:15,292
Hold your horses, let me tell the story!

1346
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,167
So...

1347
01:24:17,292 --> 01:24:18,917
Listen, pay attention.

1348
01:24:19,042 --> 01:24:20,500
I... I...

1349
01:24:21,833 --> 01:24:23,039
I'm lying in bed with her.
And my mom was...

1350
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,760
I'm lying in bed with her.
And my mom was...

1351
01:24:24,917 --> 01:24:28,333
She was an incredibly sexy woman.
With these...

1352
01:24:28,458 --> 01:24:28,800
big boobs and curves and...

1353
01:24:28,801 --> 01:24:30,875
big boobs and curves and...

1354
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,625
She was an icon!

1355
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:34,375
I start to touch her.

1356
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,292
I caress her here, on her breast

1357
01:24:38,417 --> 01:24:40,319
and think, Man, is that nice!

1358
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:40,375
And think, Man, is that nice!

1359
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,500
Don't hit!

1360
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,875
- Good, slap him! Slap him!
- It was lovely.

1361
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:46,080
Then I move a bit lower down.

1362
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:48,500
Then I move a bit lower down.

1363
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:51,000
I caress her...

1364
01:24:51,542 --> 01:24:51,840
I caress her here, on her thigh.

1365
01:24:51,841 --> 01:24:55,917
I caress her here, on her thigh.

1366
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:57,599
And then all of a sudden I feel something,

1367
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,667
And then all of a sudden I feel something,

1368
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:03,359
I panicked.
Something came out of me, that...

1369
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,976
I panicked.
Something came out of me, that...

1370
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
What?

1371
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:08,542
How old were you?

1372
01:25:08,667 --> 01:25:09,120
It started to shoot out and didn't stop.

1373
01:25:09,121 --> 01:25:12,250
It started to shoot out and didn't stop.

1374
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:14,879
I had no idea. I thought I was dying.

1375
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,125
I had no idea. I thought I was dying.

1376
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:17,667
Was it real or were you dreaming?

1377
01:25:17,792 --> 01:25:18,667
No, real!

1378
01:25:18,792 --> 01:25:20,639
- What did she do?
- She didn't realize.

1379
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:21,500
- What did she do?
- She didn't realize.

1380
01:25:21,625 --> 01:25:25,250
- She was asleep!
- Right, she was asleep.

1381
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:26,399
- I don't have a story like that.
- No?

1382
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,292
- I don't have a story like that.
- No?

1383
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:32,159
I mean, I have sexual stories,
but not like that.

1384
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,042
I mean, I have sexual stories,
but not like that.

1385
01:25:33,167 --> 01:25:34,292
But...

1386
01:25:36,208 --> 01:25:37,250
Like what?

1387
01:25:38,042 --> 01:25:39,750
Now I want to know!

1388
01:25:40,208 --> 01:25:43,679
I was really young.
5, even younger.

1389
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,976
I was really young.
5, even younger.

1390
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,500
- Almost a baby. 'Cause...
- Tell us.

1391
01:25:47,625 --> 01:25:49,439
We always took our baths
at the bakery behind our house.

1392
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,226
We always took our baths
at the bakery behind our house.

1393
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:55,199
I loved it, it was warm.
We didn't have a bathtub at home.

1394
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:55,292
I loved it, it was warm.
We didn't have a bathtub at home.

1395
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:58,792
Their bathroom was next to the bakery oven.

1396
01:25:58,917 --> 01:26:00,750
Mom left me there alone.

1397
01:26:01,125 --> 01:26:03,000
A man came in...

1398
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:06,719
one of the baker's helpers,
I found out later.

1399
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:07,000
One of the baker's helpers,
I found out later.

1400
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:09,625
And, I dunno, he took me...

1401
01:26:11,125 --> 01:26:12,479
He picked me up, sat me on something,
and rubbed me against him.

1402
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,917
He picked me up, sat me on something,
and rubbed me against him.

1403
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:18,239
Later I realized it must've been his...

1404
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:19,800
Later I realized it must've been his...

1405
01:26:20,583 --> 01:26:23,999
his willy. It was pointing up
and he rubbed himself against me.

1406
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,518
His willy. It was pointing up
and he rubbed himself against me.

1407
01:26:25,542 --> 01:26:29,125
Then Mom came in
and he quickly sat me on a towel.

1408
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:29,760
And somehow...

1409
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:30,375
And somehow...

1410
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:31,500
Imagine...

1411
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:33,125
I saw his cock!

1412
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:35,519
It must've felt nice. I didn't mind.

1413
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:35,750
It must've felt nice. I didn't mind.

1414
01:26:35,875 --> 01:26:37,000
Really?

1415
01:26:37,167 --> 01:26:39,792
I think I probably giggled, like...

1416
01:26:39,917 --> 01:26:41,279
like it was a game.
I mean, I was still little.

1417
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,018
Like it was a game.
I mean, I was still little.

1418
01:26:43,042 --> 01:26:44,875
Now for the next game.

1419
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,039
We played the truth game. Now we'll play...

1420
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:47,750
We played the truth game. Now we'll play...

1421
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,625
We'll play...

1422
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:52,799
We'll play Find Richie!

1423
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:53,125
We'll play Find Richie!

1424
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:54,667
OK, let's play.

1425
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:55,917
Find Richie!

1426
01:26:56,042 --> 01:26:57,500
What are you doing?

1427
01:26:57,625 --> 01:26:58,560
Leave my tits alone!

1428
01:26:58,561 --> 01:26:59,917
Leave my tits alone!

1429
01:27:00,042 --> 01:27:02,042
Annie, that's also...

1430
01:27:02,167 --> 01:27:04,292
I'll tell you a lesbian story.

1431
01:27:04,417 --> 01:27:06,750
Annie, this game's fun too.

1432
01:27:06,875 --> 01:27:09,125
It's a fantastic game.

1433
01:27:09,667 --> 01:27:10,080
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...

1434
01:27:10,081 --> 01:27:12,000
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...

1435
01:27:12,125 --> 01:27:13,542
9, 10, 13...

1436
01:27:13,667 --> 01:27:15,839
Stop! 20, 21, 22, 23, 24...

1437
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:16,920
Stop! 20, 21, 22, 23, 24...

1438
01:27:22,667 --> 01:27:24,000
It's dark.

1439
01:27:24,125 --> 01:27:25,375
Richie Bitchy?

1440
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,359
Mine has a flashlight too.

1441
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:27,625
Mine has a flashlight too.

1442
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:31,750
Richie Bitchy, come out!
Or your eyes we'll scratch out!

1443
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:33,120
Emilia, he won't be in the next room.
That'd be stupid.

1444
01:27:33,121 --> 01:27:36,625
Emilia, he won't be in the next room.
That'd be stupid.

1445
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:38,879
I dunno, he's pretty drunk.

1446
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,125
I dunno, he's pretty drunk.

1447
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Where now?

1448
01:27:44,042 --> 01:27:44,640
I'm going... Hold on,
I'll comb each floor.

1449
01:27:44,641 --> 01:27:48,125
I'm going... Hold on,
I'll comb each floor.

1450
01:27:48,458 --> 01:27:50,399
- Not me.
- It's this way.

1451
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:50,583
- Not me.
- It's this way.

1452
01:27:50,792 --> 01:27:52,000
I'll look here.

1453
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:01,542
Please help us find you.

1454
01:28:05,875 --> 01:28:06,875
Not there.

1455
01:28:08,167 --> 01:28:09,542
Richie!

1456
01:28:09,875 --> 01:28:12,667
Maybe you're not far away.

1457
01:28:13,792 --> 01:28:16,250
What's this, a single room?

1458
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:18,125
Let's look.

1459
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:19,200
Richie, are you in the drawer?

1460
01:28:19,201 --> 01:28:20,401
Richie, are you in the drawer?

1461
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,625
Richie, I'm coming.

1462
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:24,833
I'll find you!

1463
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:30,720
Richie?

1464
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,720
Richie?

1465
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:35,375
He wasn't there. I looked everywhere.
He's gone.

1466
01:28:37,125 --> 01:28:39,875
He can't have just dumped us here.

1467
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:42,239
- What?
- He can't have just dumped us here.

1468
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,960
- What?
- He can't have just dumped us here.

1469
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:46,333
I don't think so.

1470
01:28:53,792 --> 01:28:55,750
It's cold.

1471
01:28:56,125 --> 01:28:57,125
Richie!

1472
01:29:00,375 --> 01:29:01,875
I'm so cold.

1473
01:29:10,625 --> 01:29:11,040
C'mon.

1474
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,040
C'mon.

1475
01:29:12,625 --> 01:29:13,625
Annie!

1476
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:16,799
I can't find him.

1477
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,800
I can't find him.

1478
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:42,417
- Do you really want to?
- Yeah.

1479
01:29:42,625 --> 01:29:44,375
- Do you want to?
- Yeah.

1480
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:45,599
Say it again.

1481
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:45,625
Say it again.

1482
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:46,750
Yeah!

1483
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:47,875
Shh!

1484
01:29:54,875 --> 01:29:56,500
Here we are.

1485
01:29:57,250 --> 01:29:58,375
My god!

1486
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:07,625
There's something I'd like.

1487
01:30:08,542 --> 01:30:08,638
Yeah?

1488
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:09,639
Yeah?

1489
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,292
Whatever you want.

1490
01:30:12,625 --> 01:30:13,625
I'd like...

1491
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,667
I'd like...

1492
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,250
You know I sometimes...

1493
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:20,159
I sometimes...

1494
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:20,292
I sometimes...

1495
01:30:21,167 --> 01:30:22,625
feel so lonely.

1496
01:30:24,125 --> 01:30:25,919
And I've always found you

1497
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,000
And I've always found you

1498
01:30:26,625 --> 01:30:28,500
incredibly hot.

1499
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:30,500
I'd like...

1500
01:30:31,375 --> 01:30:31,680
I'd...

1501
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:32,680
I'd...

1502
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,125
like...

1503
01:30:41,042 --> 01:30:42,375
I want this...

1504
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:43,200
to never end.

1505
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,200
To never end.

1506
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,625
That's what I'd like.

1507
01:30:50,667 --> 01:30:52,708
You have incredible breasts.

1508
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:54,720
That really turns me on.

1509
01:30:54,721 --> 01:30:56,750
That really turns me on.

1510
01:30:57,375 --> 01:30:59,542
That's what I need.

1511
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:00,480
I want something else too.

1512
01:31:00,481 --> 01:31:02,125
I want something else too.

1513
01:31:02,667 --> 01:31:03,875
I'd like...

1514
01:31:06,792 --> 01:31:09,042
I'd like you to show me some love.

1515
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:11,667
Will you show Richie Bravo some love?

1516
01:31:11,875 --> 01:31:12,000
Come here.

1517
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Come here.

1518
01:31:13,875 --> 01:31:14,875
Listen.

1519
01:31:15,333 --> 01:31:16,333
Listen.

1520
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:19,958
Will you show Richie

1521
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,208
some love?

1522
01:31:22,875 --> 01:31:23,520
Yes.

1523
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,520
Yes.

1524
01:31:28,042 --> 01:31:29,279
How long have you known me?

1525
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,360
How long have you known me?

1526
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:32,125
How long have you been

1527
01:31:32,667 --> 01:31:33,667
my fan?

1528
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,250
A long time.

1529
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:38,542
A long time?

1530
01:31:39,375 --> 01:31:40,625
Now he's yours.

1531
01:31:43,875 --> 01:31:45,125
He's yours.

1532
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:46,560
Richie Bravo.

1533
01:31:46,561 --> 01:31:47,750
Richie Bravo.

1534
01:31:48,792 --> 01:31:50,125
Show him...

1535
01:31:50,458 --> 01:31:51,750
Show him some love.

1536
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,042
Show him some love.

1537
01:31:58,375 --> 01:32:00,750
I'm kneeling down before you.

1538
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,167
I'm kneeling before you.

1539
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:03,840
Kneeling is good.

1540
01:32:03,841 --> 01:32:05,125
Kneeling is good.

1541
01:32:08,458 --> 01:32:09,599
Show that you love him.

1542
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,125
Show that you love him.

1543
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,083
That you really love him.

1544
01:32:12,208 --> 01:32:14,125
I want you to look at me.

1545
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:15,250
Look at me.

1546
01:32:15,292 --> 01:32:15,360
- Please, come.
- Look at me.

1547
01:32:15,361 --> 01:32:17,250
- Please, come.
- Look at me.

1548
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,250
Say it. Say it.

1549
01:32:19,625 --> 01:32:21,119
Say, Fuck me, Richie!

1550
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:21,250
Say, Fuck me, Richie!

1551
01:32:21,375 --> 01:32:22,750
Fuck me, Richie!

1552
01:32:23,042 --> 01:32:24,042
Say it.

1553
01:32:24,292 --> 01:32:26,879
Say it. Fuck me, Richie.

1554
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:27,000
Say it. Fuck me, Richie.

1555
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:28,333
Fuck me, Richie!

1556
01:32:28,458 --> 01:32:30,000
Want me to fuck you?

1557
01:32:30,125 --> 01:32:31,417
Want me to fuck you?

1558
01:32:31,542 --> 01:32:32,639
Yes, fuck me.

1559
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,640
Yes, fuck me.

1560
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:35,625
Fuck me, Richie. Fuck me.

1561
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:37,375
Show me your hole.

1562
01:32:37,667 --> 01:32:38,400
Oh god.

1563
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:38,667
Oh god.

1564
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:40,250
Oh god!

1565
01:32:41,417 --> 01:32:43,375
Say it, say it.

1566
01:32:43,667 --> 01:32:44,160
You gotta say it.

1567
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,160
You gotta say it.

1568
01:32:45,375 --> 01:32:47,875
It turns me on, when you say it.

1569
01:32:48,542 --> 01:32:49,667
It excites me.

1570
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:52,167
Say, Fuck me, you dirty pig!

1571
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:53,792
What?

1572
01:32:53,917 --> 01:32:55,679
- You dirty pig!
- No, you're not a pig.

1573
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,726
- You dirty pig!
- No, you're not a pig.

1574
01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:57,583
What?

1575
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:59,333
You're not a dirty pig.

1576
01:33:05,875 --> 01:33:07,125
You know what?

1577
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:09,792
Yeah?

1578
01:33:10,250 --> 01:33:12,417
I really do like you, Emilia.

1579
01:33:12,542 --> 01:33:12,960
Sorry, what?

1580
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:13,667
Sorry, what?

1581
01:33:13,792 --> 01:33:15,625
I really do like you.

1582
01:33:19,625 --> 01:33:21,625
I hope you don't forget that.

1583
01:33:22,667 --> 01:33:23,792
I hope you...

1584
01:33:24,875 --> 01:33:27,417
I hope you don't forget
that I like you.

1585
01:33:29,125 --> 01:33:30,239
Please don't ever forget.

1586
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,240
Please don't ever forget.

1587
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:33,500
- No.
- You're a good woman.

1588
01:33:34,292 --> 01:33:35,999
- A dirty pig.
- With a big heart.

1589
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,320
- A dirty pig.
- With a big heart.

1590
01:33:38,375 --> 01:33:40,375
I really like you, you know.

1591
01:33:43,458 --> 01:33:44,750
Do you think...

1592
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:47,519
Do you think that Richie...

1593
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:48,600
Do you think that Richie...

1594
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,625
is worthy of being loved?

1595
01:34:16,375 --> 01:34:17,542
<i>When a dream</i>

1596
01:34:18,208 --> 01:34:20,542
<i>Any dream, doesn't come true</i>

1597
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,079
<i>When love</i>

1598
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:22,250
<i>When love</i>

1599
01:34:22,542 --> 01:34:24,292
<i>comes to an end</i>

1600
01:34:24,417 --> 01:34:25,958
<i>When even hope</i>

1601
01:34:26,375 --> 01:34:27,839
<i>no longer exists</i>

1602
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,000
<i>no longer exists</i>

1603
01:34:28,375 --> 01:34:30,417
<i>Only loneliness</i>

1604
01:34:37,125 --> 01:34:38,500
<i>And when a leaf</i>

1605
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:39,360
<i>Any leaf, falls from a tree</i>

1606
01:34:39,361 --> 01:34:40,792
<i>Any leaf, falls from a tree</i>

1607
01:34:40,917 --> 01:34:44,625
<i>Because the autumn wind has so decreed</i>

1608
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:45,120
<i>And when even fate</i>

1609
01:34:45,121 --> 01:34:46,667
<i>And when even fate</i>

1610
01:34:47,042 --> 01:34:48,958
<i>Takes something from us</i>

1611
01:34:49,167 --> 01:34:50,879
<i>Trust in time</i>

1612
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,000
<i>Trust in time</i>

1613
01:34:54,625 --> 01:34:56,639
<i>For the sun always rises again</i>

1614
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:59,000
<i>For the sun always rises again</i>

1615
01:35:02,875 --> 01:35:07,250
<i>And every new day brings its light</i>

1616
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:13,919
<i>For the sun always rises again</i>

1617
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,125
<i>For the sun always rises again</i>

1618
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:19,680
<i>Because darkness doesn't last forever</i>

1619
01:35:19,681 --> 01:35:24,000
<i>Because darkness doesn't last forever</i>

1620
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:25,440
<i>No, it doesn't last forever</i>

1621
01:35:25,441 --> 01:35:29,625
<i>No, it doesn't last forever</i>

1622
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,500
<i>If I hear a song</i>

1623
01:35:35,625 --> 01:35:36,959
<i>Any song we listened to</i>

1624
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,960
<i>Any song we listened to</i>

1625
01:35:38,292 --> 01:35:40,375
<i>I still feel how beautiful it was</i>

1626
01:35:40,542 --> 01:35:42,167
<i>We were happy</i>

1627
01:35:42,458 --> 01:35:42,720
<i>We were together</i>

1628
01:35:42,721 --> 01:35:43,875
<i>We were together</i>

1629
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:47,292
<i>You were here with me</i>

1630
01:36:40,375 --> 01:36:42,375
- Look familiar?
- Incredible!

1631
01:36:42,708 --> 01:36:45,625
What is this?
Some scumbag scheme of yours?

1632
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:46,080
Unbelievable. Looks like it.

1633
01:36:46,081 --> 01:36:47,667
Unbelievable. Looks like it.

1634
01:36:47,792 --> 01:36:50,583
Perhaps you weren't loving enough, dottore.

1635
01:36:51,667 --> 01:36:51,840
- Want more?
- Leave us alone.

1636
01:36:51,841 --> 01:36:53,875
- Want more?
- Leave us alone.

1637
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,292
- Look how horny she is.
- Sure.

1638
01:36:56,542 --> 01:36:57,542
Look.

1639
01:36:58,167 --> 01:37:00,417
I don't want to see it.
Turn it off.

1640
01:37:00,542 --> 01:37:01,917
What do you want?

1641
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:03,359
Let's make it fast.
You disgust me.

1642
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:04,750
Let's make it fast.
You disgust me.

1643
01:37:04,875 --> 01:37:06,125
You should watch.

1644
01:37:06,375 --> 01:37:07,958
I've seen enough.

1645
01:37:08,333 --> 01:37:09,120
What do you want?

1646
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:10,120
What do you want?

1647
01:37:31,125 --> 01:37:32,125
Darling.

1648
01:37:32,167 --> 01:37:33,625
That's OK.

1649
01:37:38,042 --> 01:37:39,042
Can we...?

1650
01:37:39,833 --> 01:37:40,833
Sure.

1651
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:47,875
What is it?

1652
01:37:48,125 --> 01:37:49,208
Take a peek.

1653
01:37:51,125 --> 01:37:52,292
With a heart!

1654
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:54,500
Count it.

1655
01:38:01,667 --> 01:38:04,625
Thank you.
You've made me happy.

1656
01:38:06,167 --> 01:38:06,720
- Nothing's nicer than making you happy.
- About time.

1657
01:38:06,721 --> 01:38:09,625
- Nothing's nicer than making you happy.
- About time.

1658
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:11,625
- There'll be more.
- Good.

1659
01:38:11,917 --> 01:38:12,480
- Careful with it.
- Thanks.

1660
01:38:12,481 --> 01:38:13,917
- Careful with it.
- Thanks.

1661
01:38:39,375 --> 01:38:41,279

1662

01:38:51,667 --> 01:38:52,799

1667
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,125
<i>For it is done</i>

1668
01:39:02,625 --> 01:39:04,319
<i>Thank you, chérie</i>

1669
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,875
<i>Thank you, chérie</i>

1670
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:21,599
Ekkehart!

1671
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:21,667
Ekkehart!

1672
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:24,958
Don't you know where your room is?

1673
01:39:26,333 --> 01:39:27,333
Hello?

1674
01:39:27,917 --> 01:39:29,792
We'll go this way.

1675
01:39:30,583 --> 01:39:32,500
That's it, straight ahead.

1676
01:39:40,125 --> 01:39:42,125
Here's the ladybug.

1677
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:46,750
Look.

1678
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,375
A wild boar.

1679
01:40:42,375 --> 01:40:43,792
To each his due.

1680
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,417
To each his due.

1681
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,319
<i>It was already dark</i>

1682
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:29,167
<i>It was already dark</i>

1683
01:41:29,292 --> 01:41:32,625

That's Richie!

<i>The glowing window of a tavern</i>

1686
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:41,040
<i>The glowing window of a tavern</i>

1689
01:41:45,601 --> 01:41:48,000
<i>I had time and I was cold</i>

1690
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:50,375
<i>So I went inside</i>

1691
01:41:51,292 --> 01:41:51,360
<i>So I just went in</i>

1692
01:41:51,361 --> 01:41:52,500
<i>So I just went in</i>

1693
01:41:54,667 --> 01:41:57,119
<i>At every table</i>
sat men with brown eyes

1694
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,476
<i>At every table</i>

<i>When they saw me</i>

1699
01:42:14,542 --> 01:42:18,167
<i>A man stood and beckoned me over</i>

1700
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:25,919
<i>Greek wine</i>

1701
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:26,920
<i>Greek wine</i>

1702
01:42:27,042 --> 01:42:30,250
<i>Blood of the earth...</i>

1703

<i>Pour yourself a glass</i>

1704
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,680
<i>Pour yourself a glass</i>

1705
01:42:33,417 --> 01:42:36,250
<i>And if I grow sad</i>

1706
01:42:36,375 --> 01:42:37,439
<i>It is only because</i>

1707
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:38,792
<i>It is only because</i>

1708
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,199
<i>I dream of home</i>

1709
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,200
<i>I dream of home</i>

1710
01:42:44,792 --> 01:42:47,583
<i>Forgive me</i>

1711
01:42:55,375 --> 01:42:56,375
Let's see.

1712
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Hey.

1713
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Hey, hello!

1714
01:43:06,167 --> 01:43:06,240
We're here.

1715
01:43:06,241 --> 01:43:07,250
We're here.

1716
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:08,750
Can we come in?

1717
01:43:10,375 --> 01:43:11,375
Yeah.

1718
01:43:11,458 --> 01:43:12,000
Here you are.

1719
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:12,625
Here you are.

1720
01:43:12,792 --> 01:43:13,958
Here we are.

1721
01:43:14,625 --> 01:43:15,625
Thank you.

1722
01:43:20,125 --> 01:43:22,375
Starting today, no more smoking.

1723
01:43:24,167 --> 01:43:25,250
Is that so?

1724
01:43:25,625 --> 01:43:26,625
Grandpa.

1725
01:43:27,375 --> 01:43:29,279
Can you empty the ashtrays?

1726
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,360
Can you empty the ashtrays?

1727
01:43:31,042 --> 01:43:32,042
Please?

1728
01:43:36,125 --> 01:43:37,125
Thank you.

1729
01:43:43,625 --> 01:43:45,292
Other wishes or ideas?

1730
01:43:45,417 --> 01:43:46,559
Yeah, we'll sleep here.

1731
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:47,560
Yeah, we'll sleep here.

1732
01:43:48,375 --> 01:43:49,375
Really?

1733
01:44:15,458 --> 01:44:16,458
Everything OK?

1734
01:44:22,125 --> 01:44:23,875
You're not serious?

1735
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,500
I said all of us.

1736
01:44:25,625 --> 01:44:26,879
No, I'm sorry, but...

1737
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:27,250
No, I'm sorry, but...

1738
01:44:27,792 --> 01:44:29,750
It's out of the question.

1739
01:44:30,250 --> 01:44:31,750
They can't move in.

1740
01:44:31,875 --> 01:44:32,640
This is my house!

1741
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:33,125
This is my house!

1742
01:44:33,292 --> 01:44:34,167
Yeah.

1743
01:44:34,292 --> 01:44:35,792
Child! Hello?

1744
01:44:35,917 --> 01:44:37,000
I'm your child.

1745
01:44:37,375 --> 01:44:38,375
Come.

1746
01:44:40,417 --> 01:44:42,250
Tessa, we have to talk.

1747
01:44:42,417 --> 01:44:43,500
We'll see.

1748
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:46,000
- We have to.
- We'll see.

1749
01:44:46,125 --> 01:44:47,000
This is...

1750
01:44:47,125 --> 01:44:48,792
It's outrageous, Tessa.

1751
01:44:49,042 --> 01:44:49,920
It's outrageous.

1752
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,920
It's outrageous.

1753
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:33,600
Nice and comfy here, huh?

1754
01:46:33,601 --> 01:46:34,917
Nice and comfy here, huh?

1755
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:36,750
Good?

1756
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:38,625
Villa Bravo.

1757
01:46:40,542 --> 01:46:42,250
Maybe you...

1758
01:46:42,875 --> 01:46:43,875
I dunno...

1759
01:46:44,333 --> 01:46:45,120
clean here?

1760
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,120
Clean here?

1761
01:46:46,625 --> 01:46:48,125
Sweep.

1762
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:49,625
Broom, y'know?

1763
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:50,792
We do.

1764
01:46:50,917 --> 01:46:52,500
'Cause, well...

1765
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:55,125
Make Allah happy!

1766
01:46:57,542 --> 01:46:59,625
He told me.

1767
01:47:01,042 --> 01:47:02,042
See you.

1768
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Tada!

1769
01:47:37,917 --> 01:47:39,000
Very funny.

1770
01:47:39,292 --> 01:47:41,250
I came to see how you are.

1771
01:47:41,625 --> 01:47:42,719
- Great.
- Yeah?

1772
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:43,720
- Great.
- Yeah?

1773
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:44,750
Good.

1774
01:47:46,667 --> 01:47:47,667
See you.
