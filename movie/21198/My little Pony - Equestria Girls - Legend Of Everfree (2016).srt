1
00:00:07,445 --> 00:00:09,489
No. It can't be.

2
00:00:10,907 --> 00:00:12,075
It isn't true.

3
00:00:13,284 --> 00:00:14,994
Um, Twilight?

4
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:18,581
Twilight! The bus for Camp Everfree

5
00:00:18,748 --> 00:00:20,291
leaves in ten minutes!

6
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,126
Oh no no no no no!

7
00:00:22,293 --> 00:00:24,087
I can't believe I overslept!

8
00:00:25,338 --> 00:00:27,340
Me neither. That's not like you.

9
00:00:28,925 --> 00:00:29,926
I know!

10
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:32,053
Don't you have
a super-annoying alarm clock that goes

11
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:39,894
It's gonna be fine.
We'll help you pack.

12
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:46,359
We're gonna be out in the woods.

13
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:48,111
When's she gonna need that?

14
00:00:48,278 --> 00:00:49,821
If we were going to the moon,

15
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:51,823
I'd insist she'd pack an evening gown.

16
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:53,825
One never knows, darling.

17
00:00:54,993 --> 00:00:56,077
Lemme just get changed.

18
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:05,670
Midnight Sparkle?!

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,171
How is this possible?

20
00:01:07,338 --> 00:01:09,883
Sunset Shimmer helped me
defeat you at the Friendship Games!

21
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:13,052
You and your friends
can never truly defeat me!

22
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,023
Midnight Sparkle's a part of you!

23
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:28,276
I'll always be there

24
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:31,154
waiting in the darkest
shadows of your mind!

25
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:33,907
I'll be back, Twilight!

26
00:01:34,073 --> 00:01:37,827
And this time,
I won't stop 'til I have all the magic!

27
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:39,746
No!
Stop!

28
00:01:39,913 --> 00:01:41,039
Twilight, wake up!

29
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:43,124
We can't stop, silly!

30
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,168
We're not there yet!

31
00:01:46,377 --> 00:01:47,879
Hey, are you okay?

32
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:49,923
Heh. I'm fine.

33
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:53,259
We are gonna have so much fun!

34
00:01:53,384 --> 00:01:55,637
We're gonna roast marshmallows
and eat marshmallows

35
00:01:55,803 --> 00:01:58,139
and sleep on marshmallow pillows!

36
00:01:58,556 --> 00:02:00,433
Yeah, probably not gonna do that.

37
00:02:00,683 --> 00:02:02,435
Maybe you're not!

38
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,771
Attention, students,

39
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:05,980
we're almost there.

40
00:02:06,147 --> 00:02:08,650
But before we arrive,
we just wanted to say

41
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:11,319
how proud we are of you
for raising enough money

42
00:02:11,486 --> 00:02:13,321
to go on this class field trip.

43
00:02:13,488 --> 00:02:14,572
When we were your age,

44
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:16,950
we made some of
our favorite memories in these woods,

45
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,785
and we're sure you will, too.

46
00:02:19,202 --> 00:02:22,455
Now who's excited for Camp Everfree?!

47
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:48,314
<i>♫ Will you be lost by time
or be part of history? ♫</i>

48
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:52,277
<i>♫ Will your story be told
or remain a mystery? ♫</i>

49
00:02:52,443 --> 00:02:55,989
<i>♫ Will they sing your song,
telling all that you have done? ♫</i>

50
00:02:56,155 --> 00:03:00,201
<i>♫ Time to make your choice,
only you can be the one. ♫</i>

51
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,001
<i>♫ As you join

52
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:17,302
<i>♫ As you join
in the Legend of Everfree! ♫</i>

53
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:22,056
<i>♫ Will you do something great
with the time that you have here? ♫</i>

54
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:25,852
<i>♫ Will you make your mark,
will you conquer what you fear? ♫</i>

55
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:29,856
<i>♫ And when you go back home,
everybody there will see ♫</i>

56

00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:54,464

60
00:03:55,381 --> 00:03:58,468
<i>♫ Will you be a falling star? ♫</i>

61
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,305
<i>♫ Here to learn what nature teaches ♫</i>

62
00:04:02,972 --> 00:04:06,267
<i>♫ Here to learn more who you are ♫</i>

63
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:09,562
<i>♫ Will you be lost by time

64
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:13,733

65
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,445

66
00:04:17,612 --> 00:04:22,617

67

68
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:39,342
<i>♫ As you join

69
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,766
Isn't Camp Everfree just beautiful?

70
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:49,519
Oh, I can't wait until
we have our first nature walk.

71
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,938
I definitely wanna go on one of those.

72
00:04:52,397 --> 00:04:54,732
You wanna smell
the adorable woodland creatures, too?

73
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:55,900
Yeah!

74
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:57,235
Specifically squirrels!

75
00:04:57,527 --> 00:04:59,821
More specifically, so I can chase 'em!

76
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:03,533
I'm just lookin' forward to roughin' it.

77
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:06,202
I'm gonna make my own shelter,
forage for food...

78
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:09,706
Uh, you know they provide us
with food in tents, right?

79
00:05:09,873 --> 00:05:11,958
Yep! Still gonna forage though.

80
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,544
I'm just after some R&R.

81
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:17,505
The past year has all been
a bit too much for my taste.

82
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:19,591
I'll say! We fought three evil sirens

83
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:21,634
who tried to hypnotize
everybody with their singing,

84
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,678
one ridiculously competitive rival school,

85
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,930
and two demon friends!

86
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:28,474
Uh, heh heh, no offense.

87
00:05:28,683 --> 00:05:29,809
None taken.

88
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:31,269
You'll get used to it.

89
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:35,857
Yep. Canterlot High
has become a regular magic magnet.

90
00:05:36,107 --> 00:05:37,775
Gonna be nice gettin' away to a place where

91
00:05:37,942 --> 00:05:39,777
we don't have
to worry 'bout that kinda stuff.

92
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:42,030
- Here ya go, Twilight.
- Thanks

93
00:05:42,197 --> 00:05:43,907
It's Flash, right?

94
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:46,492
Yup, that's me!
And you're you.

95
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:48,494
And we don't know each other very well.

96
00:05:49,412 --> 00:05:50,246
Cool story, bro.

97
00:05:50,663 --> 00:05:52,290
Right. I guess I'll...

98
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:53,666
see you around.

99
00:05:55,668 --> 00:05:56,836
You know how there's that girl

100
00:05:57,003 --> 00:05:58,296
who looks just like you when she's here

101
00:05:58,463 --> 00:06:01,049
but lives in another dimension
and she's a pony princess?

102
00:06:01,216 --> 00:06:02,217
Uh-huh.

103
00:06:02,383 --> 00:06:04,135
Flash kinda had a... thing for her.

104
00:06:04,677 --> 00:06:05,678
Oh.

105
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:08,556
Hey, everyone!

106
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:10,934
If you could start
heading to the courtyard,

107
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,268
that'd be rad!

108
00:06:12,602 --> 00:06:15,688
It's time to start
the best week of camp ever!

109
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:20,318
Hi, everyone!

110
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,778
Welcome to Camp Everfree!

111
00:06:21,945 --> 00:06:24,364
I'm Gloriosa Daisy, your camp director!

112
00:06:24,614 --> 00:06:27,116
Think of me as
your friendly camp and nature guide.

113
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:29,536
And this is my brother, Timber Spruce!

114
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:31,454
Think of me as that awesome guy...

115
00:06:31,663 --> 00:06:33,540
who should always
be invited to fun things.

116
00:06:34,165 --> 00:06:35,166
We aim to please,

117
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,335
so before we hand out
our tent assignments,

118
00:06:37,502 --> 00:06:39,087
we'd like to hear from all of you.

119
00:06:39,462 --> 00:06:41,839
You're free to do whatever you like here!

120
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:44,300
Uh, except hike near the rock quarry.

121
00:06:44,842 --> 00:06:46,010
That's off limits.

122
00:06:46,177 --> 00:06:49,305
Yes, but otherwise,
your options are wide open.

123
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:51,349
So what activities will make this

124
00:06:51,558 --> 00:06:53,434
the very best week of your lives ever?

125
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:55,395
- Ooh! Rock climbing!
- Done!

126
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:57,313
- Archery!
- Of course!

127
00:06:57,564 --> 00:06:59,440
- Tetherball!
- Naturally!

128
00:06:59,774 --> 00:07:01,359
Rainbow, I know you're excited,

129
00:07:01,526 --> 00:07:04,320
but maybe give somebody else
a chance to make a suggestion.

130
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:05,864
Arts and crafts!

131
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:08,992
My mom...
needs new pot holders.

132
00:07:09,534 --> 00:07:10,827
I'll supply the looms!

133
00:07:10,994 --> 00:07:12,245
Cookie decorating!

134
00:07:13,162 --> 00:07:15,415
I do make a mean sugar cookie.

135
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:17,917
Early morning nature walks?

136
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:20,420
With walking sticks for everyone!

137
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:23,423
Me! Oh, uh, a fashion show!

138
00:07:23,673 --> 00:07:25,842
Where I design
the most fabulous camp looks

139
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:27,677
inspired by today's hottest trends

140
00:07:27,844 --> 00:07:30,597
and have them modeled by my classmates

141
00:07:30,763 --> 00:07:32,599
in a gorgeous outdoor setting!

142
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:34,559
A camp tradition!

143
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:37,270
We have literally never done that.

144
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:40,440
I'll be taking requests
the rest of the time you're here,

145
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:42,817
so if there's anything you'd like to do,

146
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:45,069
anything you need, just ask.

147
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:46,821
But what about the camp gift?

148
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:49,824
That was my favorite
Camp Everfree tradition.

149
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,368
The camp gift! Of course!

150
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:54,537
- Really?
- Yes, really.

151
00:07:54,787 --> 00:07:55,788
Well, I just thought...

152
00:07:55,955 --> 00:07:57,040
Then you thought wrong!

153
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:59,042
Anyone else picking up on a little tension

154
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:00,793
between Gloriosa and her brother?

155
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:02,212
Ehhh...

156
00:08:02,378 --> 00:08:03,379
Little.

157
00:08:03,546 --> 00:08:05,465
Every year, campers work together

158
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,133
to create something useful.

159
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,054
A gift for future campers.
Working toward this common goal

160
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:13,723
is key to forming the strong bonds

161
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,643
that will last well
beyond your time here at camp!

162
00:08:16,809 --> 00:08:19,103
Which is why it's so important.

163
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:21,814
This gazebo was a gift
from last year's group.

164
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:24,484
Oh, oh, oh,
and the totem pole and the sundial

165
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:26,027
were also made by campers!

166
00:08:26,277 --> 00:08:28,780
The sundial was our year's gift!

167
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:32,575
Even though "some people"
thought it was a little impractical,

168
00:08:32,742 --> 00:08:35,328
since the sundial can't be used at night.

169
00:08:36,412 --> 00:08:39,165
You all seem like
a-a really amazing group.

170
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,959
So I'm certain you'll come up

171
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,670
with something inspiring to leave behind.

172
00:08:45,255 --> 00:08:47,006
Speaking of leaving things behind,

173
00:08:47,173 --> 00:08:49,425
now's the time when
we give out tent assignments.

174
00:08:49,592 --> 00:08:51,594
So you can leave your heavy bags behind.

175
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:56,724
Uh, girls will be getting
their assignments from Timber.

176
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:58,309
Guys, you're with me.

177
00:08:59,686 --> 00:09:00,687
Oh, boy!

178
00:09:03,314 --> 00:09:05,608
Yay! I'm in the Emerald Tent!

179
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:07,026
Ooh, me, too!

180
00:09:08,111 --> 00:09:09,112
Aquamarine.

181
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,363
Me, too!

182
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,489
- Woohoo!
- Oh, yeah!

183
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:12,949
I got Amethyst.

184
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:16,911
- Sapphire.
- Me, too!

185
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:18,663
I mean, I'm assuming I am.

186
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,915
Technically, sapphires aren't just blue.

187
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:23,668
They can be pink, purple, yellow...

188
00:09:24,002 --> 00:09:25,169
Yeah, but they're mostly blue.

189
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,839
That's why they're named
after the Latin word, sapphirus.

190
00:09:30,174 --> 00:09:31,259
That means, "blue".

191
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:32,427
I know.

192
00:09:32,677 --> 00:09:34,262
But did you know that sapphires

193
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:35,889
are just rubies without chromium?

194
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:37,056
No.

195
00:09:38,683 --> 00:09:41,436
But did you know that
Sapphire Tent is the best one?

196
00:09:41,603 --> 00:09:43,021
No. Why's that?

197
00:09:43,646 --> 00:09:44,647
Because you're in it.

198
00:09:45,982 --> 00:09:48,735
Oh, I bet you say that to all the campers.

199
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,861
Not true.

200
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:51,821
You're in the Ruby Tent? Ha!

201
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,489
That's the worst one!

202
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,325
Ah, man!

203
00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:58,953
I'm just jokin', buddy.
The Ruby Tent is great.

204
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:01,206
It's like a sapphire, but with chromium.

205
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:06,794
But the Ruby and Coral Tents
do look an awful lot

206
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:08,004
alike to the undiscerning eye.

207
00:10:08,338 --> 00:10:09,756
I better show you where it is.

208
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:12,050
See ya around.

209
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:17,055
What?

210
00:10:17,472 --> 00:10:18,556
Heh. Nothin'.

211
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:22,185
Ooh! That was adorable!

212
00:10:23,478 --> 00:10:25,730
Okay, everyone, go get settled in.

213
00:10:25,897 --> 00:10:27,899
We'll be meeting
at the docks in fifteen minutes

214
00:10:28,107 --> 00:10:30,318
to go over some camp safety rules!

215
00:10:30,485 --> 00:10:32,445
Lemme know if you need anything!

216
00:10:34,822 --> 00:10:36,241
I need somethin'.

217
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:40,203
Filthy Rich! So nice to see you.

218
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,788
What are you doing here?!

219
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:43,540
Camp is just getting started!

220
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:47,210
Just takin' in the scenery, Gloriosa Daisy.

221
00:10:47,544 --> 00:10:49,128
It's so... hmm...

222
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:51,589
relaxin'.

223
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:54,884
Well, you can look around
when camp is over!

224
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:56,135
Now, if you don't mind...

225
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:02,100
Fine.

226
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:08,898
Filthy Rich is, uh, an alumni of the camp.

227
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,110
He likes to check on his
old stomping grounds every now and again.

228
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:14,112
But enough about him.

229
00:11:14,362 --> 00:11:16,114
Find your tents and put away your things.

230
00:11:16,364 --> 00:11:18,950
We've got the best week
of camp ever to begin!

231
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:27,458
I'm all for learning safety rules,

232
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:29,919
but I do hope
I can get started on my designs

233
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:32,589
for the camp fashion show
sooner rather than later.

234
00:11:32,964 --> 00:11:35,633
Huh. I still can't believe
you talked Gloriosa

235
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,968
into havin' a fashion show.

236
00:11:37,135 --> 00:11:39,178
We're in the middle
of the woods for cryin' out loud!

237
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:40,722
We're s'posed to be roughin' it!

238
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:43,266
It's clear from Gloriosa's own wardrobe

239
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:45,768
that she appreciates
a well put together look.

240
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,103
Even if we are in the...

241
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,438
middle of the woods.

242
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:49,606
Fair enough.

243
00:11:49,772 --> 00:11:51,107
Just as long as you don't put me

244
00:11:51,274 --> 00:11:53,026
in one of your fancy pants outfits.

245
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:56,196
Yer gonna, aren't ya?

246
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:57,780
No. Yes!

247
00:11:57,947 --> 00:12:00,200
Don't worry.
It'll absolutely speak

248
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:01,534
to your personal sense of fashion...

249
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:06,331
That was weird back there, right?

250
00:12:06,497 --> 00:12:08,249
With that guy, Filthy Rich?

251
00:12:09,918 --> 00:12:11,336
Oh. Uh, I guess so.

252
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,839
I just have this feeling
that Gloriosa's hiding something.

253
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,592
Her brother is pretty cute, though, huh?

254
00:12:19,469 --> 00:12:20,511
He's okay.

255
00:12:20,762 --> 00:12:23,681
Ooooh, now look
who's trying to hide something!

256
00:12:23,848 --> 00:12:24,849
No, I'm not!

257
00:12:26,017 --> 00:12:27,393
Hey, you okay?

258
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,812
You seemed a little
freaked out on the bus earlier.

259
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:31,689
Probably had
another one of her nightmares.

260
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:33,816
I'm fine.

261
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:36,069
I mean, what do I have to complain about?

262
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:37,320
Ever since I transferred here,

263
00:12:37,487 --> 00:12:40,406
everyone from CHS
has been really nice and accepting,

264
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:43,618
especially considering
what happened at the Friendship Games.

265
00:12:43,993 --> 00:12:45,620
That wasn't your fault.

266
00:12:45,787 --> 00:12:47,622
Principal Cinch is
the one who encouraged you

267
00:12:47,789 --> 00:12:50,458
to try and use all that magic
to win the games for Crystal Prep.

268
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:53,127
You weren't ready
to have that kind of power.

269
00:12:53,461 --> 00:12:54,546
But it's over now.

270
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:57,048
And if there's any group
that's gonna forgive you

271
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,716
for something that happened in the past,

272
00:12:58,883 --> 00:13:00,760
trust me, it's this one.

273
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:02,220
You guys comin' or what?

274
00:13:02,387 --> 00:13:03,388
Be right there!

275
00:13:04,138 --> 00:13:05,974
I just wanna put on some sunscreen.

276
00:13:06,808 --> 00:13:08,434
Coulda sworn I packed it.

277
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:10,436
Found it!

278
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:20,572
Did you?

279
00:13:20,822 --> 00:13:22,240
How is this possible?

280
00:13:22,574 --> 00:13:24,325
I can't bellieve this. It's…

281
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:25,910
- Amazing!
- Terrible!

282
00:13:27,912 --> 00:13:29,956
Are you kidding?
This is great!

283
00:13:30,164 --> 00:13:31,749
I mean, we've all ponyed up before,

284
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,877
gotten the whole ears
and wings and tail thing,

285
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:35,420
shot magical rainbow lasers,

286
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:37,922
but nothing like this
has ever happened!

287
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:39,591
How did you do it?

288
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,800
I don't know!

289
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:42,260
Maybe I didn't?

290
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,511
Maybe it's her?!

291
00:13:44,095 --> 00:13:45,096
Her who?

292
00:13:45,263 --> 00:13:46,556
Nothing. Nevermind.

293
00:13:46,723 --> 00:13:48,516
Can we just not talk about it?

294
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:50,393
And could you please not bring

295
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,645
this whole levitating
thing up to the others?

296
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:53,730
Why not?

297
00:13:53,897 --> 00:13:55,899
You heard Applejack.
This is supposed to be

298
00:13:56,065 --> 00:13:58,151
the place where everyone
can get away from magic.

299
00:13:58,484 --> 00:13:59,485
I don't want them to know

300
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:01,279
I brought some crazy
new kind with me.

301
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:04,449
If you really don't want me to,
I won't say anything.

302
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,118
I really don't.

303
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:10,455
Okay, but this isn't
necessarily a bad thing!

304
00:14:19,297 --> 00:14:21,507
I think you just gotta
have to pick it up.

305
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,307
…show up like that!

306
00:14:29,474 --> 00:14:30,600
What did you say?

307
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:33,102
I… didn't say anything.

308
00:14:33,603 --> 00:14:35,438
Just here to make everyone

309
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:36,689
was headed over to the docks!

310
00:14:37,273 --> 00:14:38,858
- Did you need something?
- Nope.

311
00:14:39,275 --> 00:14:41,486
Because if there is anything
I can do to make

312
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:44,614
this week the best week ever,
you just let me know.

313
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:45,865
I've got this!

314
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,951
Thanks, I'm good.

315
00:14:51,037 --> 00:14:52,705
People that chipper make me nervous.

316
00:14:53,498 --> 00:14:55,542
This is gonna be so much fun!

317
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,502
I guess not all people.

318
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,713
Oh, it's beautiful, isn't it?

319
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,508
It looks like a diamond
shining in the sun!

320
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:05,343
It is lovely out here.

321
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,554
The fresh air, the cool breeze,

322
00:15:08,513 --> 00:15:10,723
the birds that land on your finger.

323
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,559
I think that only happens to you.

324
00:15:13,184 --> 00:15:14,727
Lake activities are available

325
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:16,229
every day until sunset,

326
00:15:16,396 --> 00:15:18,481
so if you want to canoe, sail,

327
00:15:18,648 --> 00:15:21,234
windsurf or swim,
just let me know.

328
00:15:25,154 --> 00:15:27,407
Aren't they just the cutest?

329
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:30,743
Whoa!

330
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:32,495
I know I'm charming,

331
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:34,539
but you don't have to fall for me.

332
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:44,340
Guess I can't get too jealous, right?

333
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:46,759
After all, she isn't my Twilight.

334
00:15:47,343 --> 00:15:48,845
Not that the other Twilight was mine!

335
00:15:49,596 --> 00:15:52,098
But, we were… you know.

336
00:15:52,515 --> 00:15:53,766
Yeah. I get it.

337
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:56,603
But if your Twilight is
a princess in Equestria,

338
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:58,062
hate to bring it to you, but

339
00:15:58,229 --> 00:15:59,939
that's where she's gonna
spend most of her time.

340
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,901
So you're saying I just
need to get over it?

341
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:04,277
Kinda, yeah.

342
00:16:04,444 --> 00:16:06,905
Ouch! You're not pulling any punches.

343
00:16:07,113 --> 00:16:09,115
Not really my style. Sorry.

344
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:11,284
This is a safety hazard.

345
00:16:11,784 --> 00:16:13,286
I suggest we close down the dock

346
00:16:13,411 --> 00:16:14,579
for the remainder of the camp.

347
00:16:16,915 --> 00:16:18,625
Oh, I'm sure it won't have to be

348
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,751
for the remainder of the camp.

349
00:16:20,084 --> 00:16:22,128
Just needs to be patched up a bit.

350
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:23,588
I've got this!

351
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,133
Huh. Or maybe we do!

352
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,385
If you ask me,
this whole dock needs to go.

353
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:32,931
Building a new one
could be our camp gift.

354
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:34,474
Sure, it would benefit us,

355
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:37,310
but a nice new dock would
benefit future campers, too.

356
00:16:37,644 --> 00:16:39,604
I don't know. It's an awful lot of work.

357
00:16:40,063 --> 00:16:42,815
I wouldn't want you guys to miss
out doing other fun camp stuff,

358
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:44,067
because you're so busy building

359
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,985
a dock for future campers.

360
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,989
I hear what you're saying, Timber,

361
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:52,283
but we're Canterlot Wondercolts!

362
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,327
We've got a reputation to uphold!

363
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:56,579
And there's no way we're
gonna leave this place

364
00:16:56,746 --> 00:16:59,499
without contributing the most
awesome camp gift ever!

365
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,835
I'm with AJ, building a
new dock is definitely it!

366
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:04,170
What do you guys think?

367
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:08,841
Looks like it's settled, then.

368
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:10,969
Looks like it.

369
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:13,263
That's some tension alright.

370
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:19,769
We can reinforce foundation.

371
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:20,979
Make it nice and sturdy.

372
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:24,023
And we can add a woodcarved
sign this is Camp Everfree.

373
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,358
And little boxes with food

374
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:27,527
so you can feed the
ducks and fishes.

375
00:17:27,694 --> 00:17:30,238
Oh, we'll add lanterns
so you can see at night!

376
00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:37,579
Oh, it's stunning!
And will make an absolutely

377
00:17:37,745 --> 00:17:40,039
perfect runway for my
camp fashion show!

378
00:17:40,456 --> 00:17:42,542
Or importantly,
it will be a great place

379
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:44,794
for docking canoes
and feeding the wildlife.

380
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:47,213
Oh, you say tomato,
I say perfect place

381
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,133
to showcase glamorous boho-chic stylings.

382
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:51,593
What do you guys think?

383
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:54,554
It's going to be a lot of work,
but we can do it!

384
00:17:54,888 --> 00:17:57,599
Yes! Adult supervision!

385
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:03,980
Huh, nice hammer.
Where did you get it?

386
00:18:04,647 --> 00:18:07,442
Em, duh! The toolbox?

387
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:10,236
Hah, that's cool. I made mine.

388
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,571
Guh.

389
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:18,578
Making lanterns out of
solar-powered garden lights!

390
00:18:18,745 --> 00:18:20,580
Pretty crafty there, Timber!

391
00:18:20,747 --> 00:18:23,917
You think that's crafty?
You should see my macaroni art.

392
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,586
I'm like the Picasso of noodles.

393
00:18:28,755 --> 00:18:29,964
Aright, now!

394
00:18:30,131 --> 00:18:31,299
You've made a lot of progress.

395
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:32,926
But it's going to be getting dark soon.

396
00:18:33,134 --> 00:18:34,302
We can pick this up tomorrow

397
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:36,304
between our other camp activities.

398
00:18:36,471 --> 00:18:37,764
Everyone, get cleaned out,

399
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:39,599
and we'll gather by the fire pit at eight

400
00:18:39,766 --> 00:18:42,560
to share s'mores and scary stories!

401
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:44,103
S'MORES!!!

402
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:48,858
And that's when she looked down

403
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:51,277
and realize she was wearing

404
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:54,113
purple socks with the burgundy dress!

405
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:01,579
Purple and burgundy, darlings!

406
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:03,581
The same color family!

407
00:19:09,837 --> 00:19:12,090
That was a terrifying story.

408
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:15,218
Yeah, I'm terrified
she'll try to tell it again.

409
00:19:16,219 --> 00:19:18,805
Anyone else have a spooky story?

410
00:19:20,014 --> 00:19:21,015
I have one.

411
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:22,684
But I'm warning you,

412
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,686
you might as well hug
your friend now.

413
00:19:25,478 --> 00:19:27,647
That's how scary it is!

414
00:19:28,314 --> 00:19:29,315
Oh, dear.

415
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:36,239
It's time I told you about
the legend of Gaia Everfree.

416
00:19:41,202 --> 00:19:42,787
<i>Many years ago</i>

417
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:46,583
<i>my great grandparents came to this forest.</i>

418
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:49,502
<i>Seeing its beauty, they decided</i>

419
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:51,671
<i>that it would be the perfect
place for a camp.</i>

420
00:19:53,673 --> 00:19:55,675
<i>But once they started building,</i>

421
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:58,845
<i>strange things started to happen.</i>

422
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:05,143
<i>One pitch-black night,
when the wind was howling,</i>

423
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,854
<i>a tree branch crashed through
the roof of their cabin.</i>

424
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:09,856
<i>They screamed and ran outside,</i>

425
00:20:09,981 --> 00:20:12,859
<i>only to see the giant creature
rising from the earth.</i>

426
00:20:13,151 --> 00:20:15,528
<i>She got wild hair,
like the roots of a tree.</i>

427
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:17,780
<i>Her mouth had jagged rock teeth</i>

428
00:20:17,947 --> 00:20:20,200
<i>and her eyes were pools of black tar.</i>

429
00:20:20,825 --> 00:20:22,911
<i>But her aura shimmered like diamonds.</i>

430
00:20:23,244 --> 00:20:24,454
<i>Anywhere she went,</i>

431
00:20:24,621 --> 00:20:26,956
<i>she left a trail of gemdust in her wake.</i>

432
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:29,375
<i>Trembling, my great grandparents</i>

433
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,377
<i>asked who she was and she wanted.</i>

434
00:20:31,878 --> 00:20:33,880
<i>In a deep and hollow voice</i>

435
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:36,883
<i>she told them
that her name was Gaia Everfree,</i>

436
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,886
<i>an ancient spirit
who held domain over the forest,</i>

437
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:43,181
<i>and that my great grandparents
were trespassing on her land.</i>

438
00:20:43,806 --> 00:20:45,934
<i>They begged her
to let them stay and build their camp</i>

439
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,436
<i>to share this wonderful place with others.</i>

440
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:51,022
<i>Gaia Everfree finally agreed,</i>

441
00:20:51,314 --> 00:20:53,024
<i>but warned them that
they would not be able</i>

442
00:20:53,191 --> 00:20:54,400
<i>to keep it forever.</i>

443
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:56,569
<i>Some day she will return</i>

444
00:20:56,736 --> 00:20:59,405
<i>and reclaim the forest as her own.</i>

445
00:21:00,114 --> 00:21:02,450
So if you see a trail of gemdust,

446
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,536
you'll know that it is…

447
00:21:05,203 --> 00:21:07,121
Gaia Everfree!

448
00:21:09,749 --> 00:21:10,917
Hey, guys!

449
00:21:11,084 --> 00:21:12,752
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you!

450
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:15,171
Then why did you come
out of the bushes?

451
00:21:15,547 --> 00:21:17,131
I… took the scenic route,

452
00:21:17,298 --> 00:21:19,801
because the forest is
beautiful at night.

453
00:21:21,344 --> 00:21:23,179
But no one else should
without a guide, okay?

454
00:21:24,222 --> 00:21:26,558
Alright, everybody,
time to head to you tents.

455
00:21:27,642 --> 00:21:29,060
Oh, hey, Gloriosa.

456
00:21:29,227 --> 00:21:30,728
Do you have extra toothbrushes?

457
00:21:30,895 --> 00:21:31,896
I forgot mine.

458
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,942
Sure do! I'll get one for you.

459
00:21:36,776 --> 00:21:38,027
I'm scared of the dark!

460
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:40,071
Do you have flashlights?

461
00:21:41,322 --> 00:21:44,033
Of course! I got this!

462
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:47,161
Fluttershy?

463
00:21:48,121 --> 00:21:51,457
Sorry, Spike.
I guess that story got to me.

464
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,668
Why? It can't be real.

465
00:21:54,127 --> 00:21:55,128
I don't know.

466
00:21:55,587 --> 00:21:57,213
Gaia Everfree could be some creature

467
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,965
that got booted from Equestria

468
00:21:59,132 --> 00:22:00,508
and ended up in this world.

469
00:22:00,675 --> 00:22:02,594
That's what happened with the sirens.

470
00:22:02,844 --> 00:22:05,096
Eh. Sounded more like
something that Timber

471
00:22:05,263 --> 00:22:06,723
was making up just to scare us.

472
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:09,434
At least I hope it was.

473
00:22:09,601 --> 00:22:11,519
Last thing I want is to have camp ruined

474
00:22:11,686 --> 00:22:13,813
by some power-crazed magical creature.

475
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,148
Oh, hear-hear.

476
00:22:15,315 --> 00:22:17,650
We had to deal with more
than our fair share of those.

477
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:20,403
At the Fall Formal, a musical showcase,

478
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,738
the Friendship Ga–

479
00:22:22,488 --> 00:22:23,573
Well, I mean, you know,

480
00:22:23,698 --> 00:22:25,909
everything turned out alright, of course.

481
00:22:27,994 --> 00:22:30,663
I'm kinda tired. I'm in a turn in.

482
00:22:32,165 --> 00:22:33,166
Maybe lay off bringing up

483
00:22:33,374 --> 00:22:34,834
what happened at the Friendship Games?

484
00:22:35,001 --> 00:22:37,128
I think she's still
pretty sensitive about it.

485
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:41,424
Our lips are sealed.

486
00:22:50,016 --> 00:22:51,017
Here I am!

487
00:22:54,062 --> 00:22:55,063
Over here.

488
00:22:59,776 --> 00:23:01,027
I'm always here!

489
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:02,195
No!

490
00:23:02,362 --> 00:23:03,905
Who's there?
What happened?

491
00:23:04,405 --> 00:23:05,406
Nothing.

492
00:23:05,573 --> 00:23:06,699
Sorry, Sunset.

493
00:23:09,452 --> 00:23:12,997
Uh, Twilight, I think something happened.

494
00:23:17,585 --> 00:23:19,671
Is it time to get up already?

495
00:23:21,714 --> 00:23:24,175
Twilight, we really have
to talk about this.

496
00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:26,219
No, we don't!

497
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:42,026
Hey, I know you don't want to,

498
00:23:42,193 --> 00:23:45,405
but I really think we need to figure out
what's going on with your magic.

499
00:23:45,446 --> 00:23:46,906
If you could learn to control it–

500
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:48,074
That's just it!

501
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:50,034
I'll never be able to control it!

502
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:55,915
What happened?

503
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,292
I didn't mean to!

504
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,211
We didn't see anything,
so we don't know what happened.

505
00:24:04,382 --> 00:24:05,383
Are you okay?

506
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,094
Yeah. It was so weird.

507
00:24:08,219 --> 00:24:11,264
We were stuck in a middle
of the lake with no wind,

508
00:24:11,389 --> 00:24:12,765
then all of a sudden

509
00:24:12,932 --> 00:24:13,933
BAM!

510
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,767
The wind picked up

511
00:24:14,934 --> 00:24:17,353
and we were pushed
right into the dock.

512
00:24:18,938 --> 00:24:20,940
You don't think it was the spirit,
do you?!

513
00:24:21,608 --> 00:24:23,610
No, it was me.

514
00:24:24,903 --> 00:24:28,072
Spirit, show yourself!

515
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:32,285
The Great and Powerful
Trixie commands it!

516
00:24:32,452 --> 00:24:33,620
What's that?!

517
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:41,419
Oh, man!
All our hard work!

518
00:24:41,794 --> 00:24:42,795
Ruined!

519
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:44,839
At least the fishes
are really well.

520
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:46,925
Let's salvage what we can
out of the water.

521
00:24:47,091 --> 00:24:48,676
Maybe we can still fix this?

522
00:24:48,843 --> 00:24:50,094
We have to try!

523
00:24:50,261 --> 00:24:52,347
Camp Everfree needs our runway!

524
00:24:52,513 --> 00:24:53,514
Dock.

525
00:24:53,723 --> 00:24:55,683
Dock, yes, that's what I meant.

526
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:06,986
<i>♫ It used to be so simple ♫</i>

527
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,156
<i>♫ It was a world I understood ♫</i>

528
00:25:12,033 --> 00:25:14,619
<i>♫ I didn't know what I didn't know ♫</i>

529
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:17,413
<i>♫ And life seemed pretty good ♫</i>

530
00:25:19,374 --> 00:25:24,295
<i>♫ But now the darkness rises ♫</i>

531
00:25:24,712 --> 00:25:30,385
<i>♫ From somewhere deep inside of me ♫</i>

532
00:25:32,637 --> 00:25:37,392
<i>♫ Her power all but takes me ♫</i>

533
00:25:37,934 --> 00:25:43,481
<i>♫ Can I keep
this midnight from getting free? ♫</i>

534
00:25:44,148 --> 00:25:46,985
<i>♫ If I can stay with the light ♫</i>

535
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:50,154
<i>♫ I know I'll be free ♫</i>

536
00:25:50,405 --> 00:25:53,074
<i>♫ And I can start to be whole ♫</i>

537
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:56,661
<i>♫ I can start to be me ♫</i>

538
00:25:57,161 --> 00:25:59,289
<i>♫ But instead I am struggling ♫</i>

539
00:25:59,455 --> 00:26:02,458
<i>♫ With all that I see ♫</i>

540
00:26:03,293 --> 00:26:06,045
<i>♫ And these friends ♫</i>

541
00:26:06,671 --> 00:26:12,468
<i>♫ Mustn't see the midnight in me ♫</i>

542
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,557
<i>♫ The midnight in me-ee ♫</i>

543
00:26:18,349 --> 00:26:22,312
<i>♫ They mustn't see the midnight in ♫</i>

544
00:26:24,105 --> 00:26:31,154
<i>♫ Meeeee ♫</i>

545
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,335
So many squirrels.

546
00:26:45,501 --> 00:26:46,502
Spike?

547
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,255
Oh, aw man!

548
00:26:49,547 --> 00:26:51,299
I was having the best dream.

549
00:26:51,716 --> 00:26:54,886
Wait, that dream could be a reality!

550
00:26:55,136 --> 00:26:56,721
Before you run off to chase squirrels,

551
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,098
do you have any idea
where Twilight could be?

552
00:26:59,265 --> 00:27:00,683
I really need to talk to her.

553
00:27:01,017 --> 00:27:02,018
What happened?

554
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:04,604
Did you do that lifting things
off the ground again?

555
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:07,232
That's just it,
I don't know if it was her,

556
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:09,901
but if it was,
we need to deal with it head on.

557
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,694
I can track her down.

558
00:27:13,863 --> 00:27:15,949
Keep it together.
Deep breaths.

559
00:27:16,282 --> 00:27:17,784
You are not a monster.

560
00:27:18,952 --> 00:27:19,953
Oh, hi.

561
00:27:20,578 --> 00:27:22,080
What are you doing here?

562
00:27:22,247 --> 00:27:24,916
Uh, looking for you.

563
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:29,462
Oh, I just went on a nature walking,
got a little lost.

564
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:30,630
Let me show you the way.

565
00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:33,049
I'm kind of an expert
on these woods.

566
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:34,467
I've lived here my whole life.

567
00:27:34,926 --> 00:27:36,261
That must have been nice.

568
00:27:36,469 --> 00:27:37,470
Growing up at a camp.

569
00:27:37,804 --> 00:27:40,014
Yeah, though it has its downsides.

570
00:27:40,306 --> 00:27:42,600
When I was younger
I wish we would sell this place

571
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:44,769
so we can live
in a town like normal people.

572
00:27:45,228 --> 00:27:46,229
Really?

573
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:47,939
I was ten.

574
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:50,149
I really wanted to hang out in the mall.

575
00:27:52,485 --> 00:27:53,945
I've never told that to anyone.

576
00:27:54,821 --> 00:27:55,989
You must be special.

577
00:27:57,323 --> 00:27:59,951
And not just because you
have tree branch in your hair.

578
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,620
Uh. How long has that been in there?

579
00:28:02,912 --> 00:28:05,081
Not long. Just the whole
time we were talking.

580
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,333
Then why didn't you say something?

581
00:28:08,585 --> 00:28:10,336
I guess we can help Twilight deal

582
00:28:10,461 --> 00:28:12,088
with the magic stuff a little later.

583
00:28:14,674 --> 00:28:17,844
Rope climbing is all
perseverance and trust.

584
00:28:18,303 --> 00:28:21,639
Rarity, you can trust that
Applejack will spot you.

585
00:28:21,848 --> 00:28:24,350
Yeah, so you can totally
go faster than you're going.

586
00:28:24,642 --> 00:28:25,685
Rainbow Dash!

587
00:28:25,852 --> 00:28:28,646
Sorry. I've been waiting to do
this since we got here.

588
00:28:28,813 --> 00:28:31,316
Well, you have to wait
a little longer, darling.

589
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:35,445
Oh, good! Twilight!

590
00:28:35,612 --> 00:28:37,530
If you spot me, I can finally go.

591
00:28:37,697 --> 00:28:38,865
I'll go get another harness.

592
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:40,283
I'm not sure–

593
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,785
I'll better make sure
my sister doesn't need anything.

594
00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:44,370
See you later.

595
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:49,667
Twilight, there you are!

596
00:28:49,876 --> 00:28:51,002
I was looking for you!

597
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,881
Was than an earthquake?

598
00:28:55,215 --> 00:28:56,883
We aren't near any fault lines.

599
00:28:56,925 --> 00:28:57,926
Hey!

600
00:28:58,384 --> 00:29:01,638
Who left this cristaly dusty stuff here?!

601
00:29:04,224 --> 00:29:06,559
I-I believe I'd like to come down now!

602
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,481
Sorry, it's a little bit stuck.

603
00:29:18,404 --> 00:29:20,532
Applejack! What are you doing?!

604
00:29:20,865 --> 00:29:22,742
Is everything okay over there?

605
00:29:22,992 --> 00:29:24,827
Uh, I don't know what happened.

606
00:29:24,994 --> 00:29:26,579
I didn't even pull the rope that hard.

607
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,832
It's like she was light as
a feather all of sudden.

608
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:31,501
I was scared half to death!

609
00:29:31,668 --> 00:29:32,835
It wasn't my fault!

610
00:29:33,336 --> 00:29:35,838
- Let me get your harness out.
- No, thank you!

611
00:29:41,052 --> 00:29:42,887
What in the world just happened?!

612
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:44,180
Oh, dear!

613
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:46,766
I am so sorry! I think.

614
00:29:47,225 --> 00:29:49,435
Did I just do… whatever that was?

615
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:52,188
I don't think it was your fault.

616
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,399
I need to get Applejack towel.

617
00:29:55,275 --> 00:29:56,276
Me too.

618
00:29:58,736 --> 00:30:00,655
You're not the only one
with a new kind of magic!

619
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,781
This is great!

620
00:30:01,948 --> 00:30:02,949
No, it's not!

621
00:30:03,116 --> 00:30:05,493
Rarity and Applejack
could have really hurt each other!

622
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:07,287
Why is this happening?

623
00:30:07,412 --> 00:30:08,788
- I don't–
- Hi, girls!

624
00:30:08,955 --> 00:30:10,081
Anything I can do for you?

625
00:30:10,582 --> 00:30:11,958
Uh, Applejack just fallen to the lake!

626
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:13,293
Oh, no!

627
00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:15,962
She's gonna need
warm towels, dry clothes,

628
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:17,589
oh, and a hot cocoa!

629
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:19,424
I've got this!

630
00:30:23,136 --> 00:30:24,137
- Fluttershy?
- Fluttershy?

631
00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:27,557
What happened?!

632
00:30:28,641 --> 00:30:31,936
You know, we were just
decorating cookies and–

633
00:30:32,103 --> 00:30:34,063
And I was all
"You need more sprinkles!

634
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,691
And you need more sprinkles!"

635
00:30:37,066 --> 00:30:38,818
So, standard Pinkie Pie stuff.

636
00:30:39,152 --> 00:30:41,321
I was just tossing
sprinkles to Fluttershy,

637
00:30:41,487 --> 00:30:44,657
when all of a sudden they
glowed pink and exploded!

638
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,164
Just like that, only earlier!

639
00:30:51,331 --> 00:30:53,875
Oookaay, why don't you lay off

640
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,335
touching stuff for a while?

641
00:30:55,668 --> 00:30:58,504
Oh, dear. We really
should clean all of this up.

642
00:31:03,176 --> 00:31:04,677
Can someone help me out?

643
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,850
Thank you, mister bird.

644
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:13,686
Why, of course I can get
you little something to–

645
00:31:14,854 --> 00:31:16,439
Did you just…

646
00:31:16,606 --> 00:31:17,607
talk?

647
00:31:18,775 --> 00:31:20,443
But I don't speak chirp.

648
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:24,280
I don't know if you're
the only bird I can understand.

649
00:31:25,448 --> 00:31:27,784
Oh, no!
Please don't call for your friends.

650
00:31:31,496 --> 00:31:33,331
It's nice to meet all of you, too.

651
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,708
Were you just talking to the birds?

652
00:31:36,209 --> 00:31:38,503
Um, yes?

653
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,549
Did you tell them what happened?

654
00:31:42,715 --> 00:31:43,800
So crazy!

655
00:31:43,967 --> 00:31:46,636
I hoisted up Rarity up the wall
climbing wall like it was nothing!

656
00:31:46,803 --> 00:31:49,138
Like I had way more strenght
than I usually do.

657
00:31:49,305 --> 00:31:52,850
And I made diamondy thing
appear out of nowhere,

658
00:31:53,017 --> 00:31:54,686
which normally I'd be excited about.

659
00:31:54,852 --> 00:31:56,062
I mean, the facets were just perfect.

660
00:31:56,229 --> 00:31:57,230
- And the–
- Rarity!

661
00:31:57,397 --> 00:31:58,398
Oh, sorry.

662
00:31:58,565 --> 00:32:01,568
It knocked Applejack over
and then it disappeared!

663
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,072
Speaking of disappearing,
has anybody seen Rainbow Dash?

664
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:09,409
Ow!

665
00:32:09,701 --> 00:32:11,578
Whoa! How did you do that?

666
00:32:11,744 --> 00:32:12,745
I don't know.

667
00:32:12,871 --> 00:32:14,372
I've started running to get the harness,

668
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:17,542
and the next thing I knew
I was practically back in town!

669
00:32:17,709 --> 00:32:20,086
But if you had some
sort of superspeed,

670
00:32:20,211 --> 00:32:21,921
why you were gone for so long?

671
00:32:22,088 --> 00:32:23,756
Because I lost it
when I got far away.

672
00:32:23,965 --> 00:32:25,925
And then it came back
when got close to camp.

673
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,930
Being at camp is giving us
all new magical abilities!

674
00:32:31,264 --> 00:32:33,099
Not all of us has gotten new abilities.

675
00:32:33,266 --> 00:32:35,018
I haven't, but Twilight–

676
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,270
hasn't, either.

677
00:32:38,062 --> 00:32:40,565
So much for my theory that leaving CHS

678
00:32:40,732 --> 00:32:42,775
would mean leaving any
new magic business behind.

679
00:32:43,276 --> 00:32:45,612
Something at the camp
must be making this happen.

680
00:32:45,904 --> 00:32:48,740
Um, Gaia Everfree?

681
00:32:52,202 --> 00:32:54,120
Applejack! I was looking for you!

682
00:32:54,287 --> 00:32:56,581
Here, I brought you
some towels and dry clothes.

683
00:32:57,749 --> 00:32:59,751
Uh, what happened in here.

684
00:32:59,918 --> 00:33:01,461
We're kinda trying to figure that out.

685
00:33:02,295 --> 00:33:04,547
Well, don't worry about it.
I got this!

686
00:33:04,714 --> 00:33:05,715
Gloriosa!

687
00:33:06,216 --> 00:33:08,259
I kicked my beanbag into the lake!

688
00:33:10,136 --> 00:33:11,262
I'll get you another one!

689
00:33:11,804 --> 00:33:13,431
And I'm all out of arrows!

690
00:33:13,806 --> 00:33:16,476
Say no more!
New arrows coming right up!

691
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:17,810
There you are!

692
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,104
Filthy Rich is back.

693
00:33:20,271 --> 00:33:21,272
Do you want me to handle it?

694
00:33:21,439 --> 00:33:22,815
Absolutely not!

695
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:24,275
I got this!

696
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:26,986
Fluttershy, enough with the screaming!

697
00:33:27,987 --> 00:33:29,155
I didn't scream.

698
00:33:29,656 --> 00:33:30,657
For once.

699
00:33:30,907 --> 00:33:31,908
Nobody did.

700
00:33:32,158 --> 00:33:33,159
Huh?

701
00:33:33,326 --> 00:33:34,494
Attention, campers!

702
00:33:34,661 --> 00:33:37,914
Anyone who's interested in making
floating paper lanterns,

703
00:33:38,164 --> 00:33:40,291
please meet us by the picnic tables.

704
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:42,126
I don't know about the rest of y'all,

705
00:33:42,293 --> 00:33:44,671
but I've been looking forward
to coming here for a month.

706
00:33:45,004 --> 00:33:48,007
Maybe we'll forget
about this new magic for a bit

707
00:33:48,174 --> 00:33:51,135
and just try to focus
on enjoying our time at camp?

708
00:33:51,302 --> 00:33:53,137
I was also excited about designs

709
00:33:53,304 --> 00:33:55,139
I've come up for the camp fashion show.

710
00:33:55,306 --> 00:33:58,101
And I've barely gotten to
whoop anybody in tetherball.

711
00:33:58,685 --> 00:34:00,436
I think we should try to figure it out.

712
00:34:00,812 --> 00:34:02,480
But if letting it go for now

713
00:34:02,689 --> 00:34:03,982
is what the rest of you want…

714
00:34:15,201 --> 00:34:18,705
Um, Pinkie Pie,
what are you doing?

715
00:34:18,705 --> 00:34:20,373
Putting marshmallows in my lantern.

716
00:34:20,373 --> 00:34:21,332
Then when we light them,

717
00:34:21,332 --> 00:34:24,127
mine will be beautiful and delicious!

718
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:28,548
Hey, Twilight,
why aren't you with everyone else?

719
00:34:28,548 --> 00:34:30,216
Sunset said something at camp

720
00:34:30,216 --> 00:34:32,719
is causing the other girls
to get new magic.

721
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,721
I think it's Midnight Sparkle.

722
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:37,223
She's still part of me.
I can feel it.

723
00:34:37,223 --> 00:34:40,018
And I think her magic
is infecting my friends.

724
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:41,519
What are we gonna do?

725
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:43,563
I don't know what I can do.

726
00:34:43,563 --> 00:34:45,231
Okay, everyone!

727
00:34:45,231 --> 00:34:48,985
It's time to watch your lanterns fly!

728
00:34:54,407 --> 00:34:58,703
Hey, cool lantern! Mine's my face.

729
00:35:06,377 --> 00:35:08,213
Uh, you okay?

730
00:35:08,213 --> 00:35:09,088
Mhm.

731
00:35:09,088 --> 00:35:10,965
You don't seem like yourself tonight.

732
00:35:19,015 --> 00:35:22,393
Ready? And… Go!

733
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:31,694
Aw! Oh well!
Now I get to eat it!

734
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:35,949
Yep, Beautiful and delicious.

735
00:35:50,463 --> 00:35:51,506
Twilight?

736
00:35:55,677 --> 00:36:00,265
Twilight!
Oh, where is she going?

737
00:36:06,104 --> 00:36:07,355
Twilight?

738
00:36:09,357 --> 00:36:11,150
What are you doing out here?

739
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:14,404
We're…
we're meeting a cab to take us home.

740
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:16,990
She thought you'd talk her out of it.

741
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:20,743
Because I would.
Twilight, you can't leave.

742
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:24,914
You don't think it was the spirit,
do you?!

743
00:36:25,206 --> 00:36:27,584
No, it was me.

744
00:36:27,584 --> 00:36:29,502
I think it's Midnight Sparkle.

745
00:36:29,502 --> 00:36:30,837
She's still part of me.

746
00:36:30,837 --> 00:36:32,171
I can feel it.

747
00:36:32,171 --> 00:36:35,133
And I think her magic
is infecting my friends.

748
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:40,513
Twilight, there's no Midnight Sparkle,

749
00:36:40,513 --> 00:36:41,973
there's only you.

750
00:36:41,973 --> 00:36:43,975
How did you know what
I was thinking?

751
00:36:43,975 --> 00:36:46,686
When I touched your hand,
I can see things.

752
00:36:46,686 --> 00:36:49,022
I can understand why
you were leaving.

753
00:36:49,647 --> 00:36:51,482
My new magic!

754
00:36:51,482 --> 00:36:52,859
This is my new magic!

755
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:54,319
This is incredible!

756
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:57,197
No, it's not. I'm infecting you now!

757
00:36:57,197 --> 00:37:00,491
Twilight, you have to stop
looking at this as a bad thing.

758
00:37:00,491 --> 00:37:01,784
Easy for you to say.

759
00:37:01,784 --> 00:37:04,162
Magic turned you into something beautiful.

760
00:37:04,162 --> 00:37:05,955
The last time I tried to use it,

761
00:37:05,997 --> 00:37:07,373
it turned me into a monster.

762
00:37:07,707 --> 00:37:10,293
I'm just so afrai it's gonna happen again.

763
00:37:10,293 --> 00:37:13,796
Yes, last time into something amazing,

764
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:16,799
but I've let magic turn
me into a monster, too.

765
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:20,303
So if anyone understands
what you're going through, it's me.

766
00:37:20,511 --> 00:37:22,347
I can help you, Twilight.

767
00:37:22,347 --> 00:37:24,849
And the rest of our friends
can be there for you, too.

768
00:37:24,974 --> 00:37:26,893
But not if you run away.

769
00:37:28,186 --> 00:37:29,562
I'll stay.

770
00:37:29,562 --> 00:37:31,397
I still don't think this is a good idea

771
00:37:31,397 --> 00:37:33,733
for me to be near the rest
of our friends right now.

772
00:37:33,733 --> 00:37:36,194
Not until we know why
this is happening.

773
00:37:36,194 --> 00:37:37,654
Understood.

774
00:37:38,738 --> 00:37:40,073
What was that?!

775
00:37:42,867 --> 00:37:45,495
Oh, wait. Twilight?

776
00:37:45,912 --> 00:37:48,957
Timber?
I'm so glad it's just you!

777
00:37:48,957 --> 00:37:50,708
What are you doing out here?

778
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:52,627
With an axe.

779
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:55,713
I was chopping down firewood.

780
00:37:55,713 --> 00:37:57,423
In the middle of a night?

781
00:37:57,423 --> 00:37:59,884
We needed more for
tomorrow's campire.

782
00:37:59,884 --> 00:38:02,262
And if I didn't take
care of it tonight,

783
00:38:02,262 --> 00:38:05,598
it would be one more thing
Gloriosa would add to her list.

784
00:38:05,807 --> 00:38:08,101
I've got this!

785
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,936
What about you two?

786
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:12,897
Why are you hanging out
in the woods in the middle of a night.

787
00:38:13,273 --> 00:38:15,316
Oh, I was sleepwalking.

788
00:38:15,316 --> 00:38:17,777
Twilight found me and was
bringing me back to camp.

789
00:38:17,777 --> 00:38:18,611
Mhm.

790
00:38:18,611 --> 00:38:21,155
Come on, I'll walk you guys back.

791
00:38:21,155 --> 00:38:27,537
I'll protect you from Gaia Everfree!
Everfree!

792
00:38:27,537 --> 00:38:30,498
Everfree!

793
00:38:30,498 --> 00:38:33,626
Come on, that's obviously
just a spooky story

794
00:38:33,626 --> 00:38:35,587
you made up to tell around the campfire.

795
00:38:35,587 --> 00:38:38,798
Oh, no. It's legit.
How else would you explain

796
00:38:38,798 --> 00:38:40,174
what happened at the docks?

797
00:38:40,174 --> 00:38:42,594
And that weird thing when
the earth shook?

798
00:38:42,594 --> 00:38:46,097
Uh, come on,
I know a shortcut back to the tents.

799
00:38:52,312 --> 00:38:57,317
Legit, huh? I think we just
found our Gaia Everfree.

800
00:38:57,317 --> 00:38:59,277
But why would he work so hard

801
00:38:59,277 --> 00:39:00,695
to make us think she was real?

802
00:39:00,695 --> 00:39:04,115
You heard what he said about wishing
his sister would sell out the camp.

803
00:39:04,282 --> 00:39:06,075
If nobody wants to come here,

804
00:39:06,075 --> 00:39:09,037
because it's home to some
angry ancient nature spirit,

805
00:39:09,037 --> 00:39:11,206
it sure would help his cause.

806
00:39:11,206 --> 00:39:12,707
We should tell Twilight.

807
00:39:12,707 --> 00:39:16,669
Not yet. She's obviously
going on through a lot right now.

808
00:39:16,669 --> 00:39:19,088
We should probably be one
hundred percent sure

809
00:39:19,088 --> 00:39:20,798
before we tell her the guy she likes

810
00:39:20,798 --> 00:39:23,885
is a jerk who's trying to run
everybody out of camp.

811
00:39:35,855 --> 00:39:41,319
Phew! Uh, you gonna give
us a hand here, Rarity?

812
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:42,695
Oh, I'd love to,

813
00:39:42,695 --> 00:39:44,948
but I really need to get the
stiching on this poncho done

814
00:39:44,948 --> 00:39:47,033
before it's going to make it
into the camp fashion show.

815
00:39:47,033 --> 00:39:48,868
Not to haste you two with moving.

816
00:39:48,868 --> 00:39:51,287
I don't know that the runway
will ever be finished.

817
00:39:51,287 --> 00:39:53,706
The dock is our gift to the camp

818
00:39:53,873 --> 00:39:55,416
and it's gonna get finished.

819
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:57,335
That is if Rainbow Dash

820
00:39:57,335 --> 00:39:59,295
would hurry up and
bring me more wood.

821
00:39:59,879 --> 00:40:01,589
Oh, I can't go any faster!

822
00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:03,675
I don't want to end up
in the woods again.

823
00:40:03,675 --> 00:40:05,176
Don't be silly.

824
00:40:05,552 --> 00:40:06,719
Really?

825
00:40:10,723 --> 00:40:12,475
I know I said we should try to forget

826
00:40:12,475 --> 00:40:15,728
all about this new magic business,
but I can't.

827
00:40:16,229 --> 00:40:18,731
What if I hammer the
board into splinters?

828
00:40:20,942 --> 00:40:23,278
Aw, shoot! I'm out of nails.

829
00:40:23,278 --> 00:40:25,363
Oh, here you go!

830
00:40:25,363 --> 00:40:27,615
Pinkie, no!

831
00:40:33,496 --> 00:40:36,374
What?
Oh, did you think that nails

832
00:40:36,374 --> 00:40:38,626
would explode like the sprinkles?
Wow!

833
00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:40,420
Glad that didn't happen, huh?

834
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:43,590
Sorry, girls.
I didn't mean to.

835
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,384
And I don't know how
to control this.

836
00:40:46,384 --> 00:40:47,343
It's okay.

837
00:40:47,343 --> 00:40:49,262
Oh, none of us do.

838
00:40:49,262 --> 00:40:51,890
Which is why we shouldn't
pretend this isn't happening.

839
00:40:52,265 --> 00:40:53,933
Do you have it now, too?

840
00:40:53,933 --> 00:40:55,226
It started last night.

841
00:40:55,226 --> 00:40:56,603
When I touch people,

842
00:40:56,603 --> 00:40:58,146
it's like I can feel
what they're feeling

843
00:40:58,146 --> 00:40:59,272
and see their memories.

844
00:40:59,272 --> 00:41:02,859
Oooh, fancy!
Try me, try me!

845
00:41:04,986 --> 00:41:08,573
Lalalala. Ooh, taffy!

846
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:13,453
That explains so much.

847
00:41:13,453 --> 00:41:14,120
Yep.

848
00:41:14,913 --> 00:41:17,707
Girls, we can't just brush
these powers aside,

849
00:41:17,707 --> 00:41:20,501
because it doesn't seem
like the ideal time to get them.

850
00:41:21,085 --> 00:41:23,046
What if it turns out that

851
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:25,798
they could actually
make things better?

852
00:41:26,216 --> 00:41:28,259
<i>♫ So you have magic ♫</i>

853
00:41:28,259 --> 00:41:30,678

<i>♫ And it's not that great ♫</i>

883
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:02,228
<i>♫ But when it found you ♫</i>

884
00:43:02,228 --> 00:43:04,522
<i>♫ You know it was fate ♫</i>

885
00:43:04,522 --> 00:43:07,233
<i>♫ So, if you listen close ♫</i>

886
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:09,736
<i>♫ You might make a new friend ♫</i>

887
00:43:09,736 --> 00:43:13,865
<i>♫ And together we can make it! ♫</i>

888
00:43:13,865 --> 00:43:18,369
<i>♫ I say embrace the magic ♫</i>

889
00:43:18,703 --> 00:43:22,582
<i>♫ No more holding back, just let it out ♫</i>

890
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:28,129
<i>♫ If you can take the magic ♫</i>

891
00:43:28,129 --> 00:43:32,592
<i>♫ And learn a little more what it can do ♫</i>

892
00:43:32,592 --> 00:43:37,347
<i>♫ Once the magic is part of you ♫</i>

893
00:43:37,347 --> 00:43:41,893
<i>♫ Once the magic is part of yoooou ♫</i>

894
00:43:42,185 --> 00:43:47,357
<i>♫ Once the magic is part of yoooou ♫</i>

895
00:43:47,357 --> 00:43:50,276
<i>♫ Once the magic is part of you ♫</i>

896
00:43:53,112 --> 00:43:55,782
Okay, that was pretty awesome!

897
00:43:55,782 --> 00:43:58,159
And look what you
managed to acomplish!

898
00:44:01,704 --> 00:44:04,123
Please, please, please, can
we do a run-through

899
00:44:04,123 --> 00:44:06,376
for the fashion show
on it right this minute?

900
00:44:06,376 --> 00:44:09,337
Thought you weren't finished with
the stiching on your poncho.

901
00:44:10,296 --> 00:44:12,632
I am now.

902
00:44:12,632 --> 00:44:13,633
Get started without me.

903
00:44:13,633 --> 00:44:14,884
I've got to find Twilight.

904
00:44:14,884 --> 00:44:16,469
Seeing what we've been able to do here

905
00:44:16,594 --> 00:44:18,596
make her embrace
the new magic, too!

906
00:44:18,596 --> 00:44:20,890
Uh, not that she has any.

907
00:44:22,642 --> 00:44:26,604
I just wish you didn't tell
them that ridiculous story!

908
00:44:26,604 --> 00:44:28,982
Ah, this is all too much for you!

909
00:44:28,982 --> 00:44:30,775
You have to let it go!

910
00:44:30,775 --> 00:44:34,320
I knew it! He wants her to
get rid of the camp!

911
00:44:39,284 --> 00:44:40,076
Uh!

912
00:44:40,076 --> 00:44:42,996
Sunset Shimmer?
What were you doing behind that door?

913
00:44:42,996 --> 00:44:46,749
What? Um, nothing. I,
um, lost an earring.

914
00:44:46,749 --> 00:44:48,459
Uh, there it is!

915
00:44:49,502 --> 00:44:52,130
Hey, listen.
I'm glad I ran into you.

916
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:53,882
I really wanted to thank you.

917
00:44:53,882 --> 00:44:55,216
For what?

918
00:44:55,633 --> 00:44:56,926
Huh, for the tough love.

919
00:44:57,176 --> 00:44:59,178
Telling me I should get over Twilight.

920
00:44:59,178 --> 00:45:00,430
I needed to hear that.

921
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:02,473
Sure, no problem.

922
00:45:02,473 --> 00:45:04,350
Is something wrong?

923
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:06,352
What?
No. Why?

924
00:45:06,352 --> 00:45:09,022
Come on, Sunset.
We used to date.

925
00:45:09,022 --> 00:45:10,815
I know when something's
bothering you.

926
00:45:11,691 --> 00:45:14,110
Okay, here's the deal.

927
00:45:14,527 --> 00:45:15,778
My friend really likes someone,

928
00:45:15,778 --> 00:45:18,198
but I don't think that someone
isn't who she thinks they are.

929
00:45:18,198 --> 00:45:20,241
I don't wanna upset my friend
by telling what I think,

930
00:45:20,533 --> 00:45:21,993
because I also want to protect her,

931
00:45:21,993 --> 00:45:24,204
because if what I think is
happening is really happening,

932
00:45:24,204 --> 00:45:26,039
then she deserves to know.

933
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:27,248
You know?

934
00:45:27,248 --> 00:45:31,377
Nnno.
But what I do know is that your friend

935
00:45:31,377 --> 00:45:33,630
is lucky to have someone
like you to look out for her.

936
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:34,756
Really?

937
00:45:34,756 --> 00:45:38,551
Yeah. You know,
you've changed a lot since we went out.

938
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:41,179
You're so much… nicer.

939
00:45:41,179 --> 00:45:43,723
Thanks. I'm glad you noticed.

940
00:45:43,723 --> 00:45:46,559
Uh, look, maybe you and me…

941
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:49,437
We could start over as… friends.

942
00:45:49,437 --> 00:45:51,189
Uh, uh, sounds great.

943
00:45:51,189 --> 00:45:52,565
I gotta go!

944
00:45:52,565 --> 00:45:53,733
Cool, yeah!

945
00:45:53,733 --> 00:45:55,485
I want to start over later, too!

946
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:57,946
Hah.

947
00:46:19,092 --> 00:46:20,301
Ah, shoot!

948
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:23,846
He's definitely up to something!

949
00:46:29,185 --> 00:46:32,063
It's Sunset.
She says to meet her by the rock quarry.

950
00:46:32,063 --> 00:46:34,649
I though we weren't supposed
to hike out that far.

951
00:46:34,649 --> 00:46:36,109
She says it's important!

952
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,449
What is that?

953
00:46:45,118 --> 00:46:46,327
Shh!

954
00:46:51,165 --> 00:46:52,876
What's going on down there?

955
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:55,253
I think it's Gaia Everfree.

956
00:46:55,253 --> 00:46:58,798
Or rather someone who wants
us to think she's back.

957
00:46:58,798 --> 00:46:59,799
C'mon!

958
00:47:09,434 --> 00:47:11,686
This place is beautiful.

959
00:47:11,686 --> 00:47:14,939
There's Equestrian magic here.

960
00:47:14,939 --> 00:47:15,815
I can…

961
00:47:16,065 --> 00:47:17,609
I can feel it.

962
00:47:17,609 --> 00:47:20,486
Wait. I thought that
Timber was just faking

963
00:47:20,486 --> 00:47:22,405
there was magical nature creature.

964
00:47:22,405 --> 00:47:23,907
Are you saying it's real?

965
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:26,868
Timber?
What does he have to do with any of this?

966
00:47:26,868 --> 00:47:27,619
Nothing.

967
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:32,123
It's all me.

968
00:47:33,416 --> 00:47:36,669
Gloriosa?
But… Timber.

969
00:47:36,669 --> 00:47:38,713
I was sure he was the
one trying

970
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,424
to make it seem like Gaia Everfree was back.

971
00:47:41,424 --> 00:47:44,177
It was you who was trying
to scare everyone away?

972
00:47:44,177 --> 00:47:48,556
I would never try scare anyone
away from Camp Everfree.

973
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:54,479
My, my.
You fell behind on your payments, Gloriosa.

974
00:47:54,479 --> 00:47:56,856
I own the land now.

975
00:47:56,856 --> 00:48:00,068
Please, my great grandparents
founded this place.

976
00:48:00,068 --> 00:48:02,529
It's been in our family
for generations!

977
00:48:02,529 --> 00:48:04,364
You have to let the camp stay!

978
00:48:04,364 --> 00:48:07,033
Instead of turning it into a spa resort

979
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,327
that will line my pockets with more money

980
00:48:09,494 --> 00:48:11,329
than this camp ever could?

981
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:14,374
I don't think so.

982
00:48:14,374 --> 00:48:19,379
Please! I-I-I-I just need
a little more time!

983
00:48:19,379 --> 00:48:23,466
Fine. I'll give you 'til the
end of the month.

984
00:48:23,466 --> 00:48:24,425
Hmph.

985
00:48:28,304 --> 00:48:29,931
What will I do?

986
00:48:34,477 --> 00:48:35,478
Huh?

987
00:49:04,299 --> 00:49:06,467
You don't know what those things are!

988
00:49:06,467 --> 00:49:10,889
But I know what they can do!
I've been practicing!

989
00:49:10,889 --> 00:49:13,308
I can control their power now!

990
00:49:13,308 --> 00:49:15,977
You don't know that for sure!

991
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:21,900
This is our camp and it's
being taken away!

992
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,527
If this has to be our last week here,

993
00:49:24,527 --> 00:49:25,904
I'm going to use whatever

994
00:49:25,904 --> 00:49:27,864
it takes to make it count!

995
00:49:48,968 --> 00:49:51,346
You were using magic
all over the place!

996
00:49:51,346 --> 00:49:53,765
I had to tell them something
to cover for you!

997
00:49:53,765 --> 00:49:55,433
What did you want me to do?

998
00:49:55,433 --> 00:49:59,979
I just wish you didn't tell
them that ridiculous story!

999
00:49:59,979 --> 00:50:02,774
Ah, this is all too much for you!

1000
00:50:02,774 --> 00:50:04,359
You have to let it go!

1001
00:50:06,945 --> 00:50:09,906
Timber wasn't talking about
letting go of the camp.

1002
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:13,660
He was talking about you letting
go of the magical geodes!

1003
00:50:14,452 --> 00:50:15,954
All those things you were doing

1004
00:50:15,954 --> 00:50:18,206
to make this week
the best week ever,

1005
00:50:18,206 --> 00:50:20,833
every time you used
magic to do them,

1006
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:23,795
you caused another problem
somewhere else!

1007
00:50:24,879 --> 00:50:28,132
Timber was…
covering for you!

1008
00:50:28,132 --> 00:50:29,008
How do you know what

1009
00:50:29,008 --> 00:50:30,635
I was doing with the geodes?

1010
00:50:30,635 --> 00:50:32,804
How do you know about the magic?

1011
00:50:32,804 --> 00:50:35,765
I can see things. Feel things.

1012
00:50:35,765 --> 00:50:39,269
Because I have magic, too.
And so does she.

1013
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:41,104
And so do our friends.

1014
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:43,690
Gloriosa, Timber wasn't wrong.

1015
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:46,025
Maybe you should stop using magic?

1016
00:50:46,025 --> 00:50:48,778
Too much of it can be dangerous
if you can't control it!

1017
00:50:48,778 --> 00:50:50,697
Oh, I got this!

1018
00:50:50,697 --> 00:50:53,908
And I'm going to use it
to save my camp.

1019
00:50:53,908 --> 00:50:56,494
I just need more power!

1020
00:50:56,494 --> 00:50:57,954
No!

1021
00:51:15,889 --> 00:51:19,058
Sorry, girls.
I know what I need to do.

1022
00:51:19,058 --> 00:51:21,227
But I feel like we're not
on the same page.

1023
00:51:21,227 --> 00:51:22,937
So…

1024
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:26,024
Gloriosa!

1025
00:51:31,446 --> 00:51:33,740
No!

1026
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:46,377
Where are Twilight and Sunset?

1027
00:51:46,377 --> 00:51:48,755
Oh, they're missing
our dress rehearsal.

1028
00:51:49,088 --> 00:51:50,256
Uh-uh.

1029
00:51:50,882 --> 00:51:52,967
I suppose we can get
started without them.

1030
00:51:52,967 --> 00:51:54,928
Whenever you're ready!

1031
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:04,437
Hmm, told you you'd like it.

1032
00:52:04,437 --> 00:52:06,773
It's alright… I guess.

1033
00:52:07,273 --> 00:52:09,359
I get to keep it after camp,
though, right?

1034
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:28,086
She looks… different.

1035
00:52:28,086 --> 00:52:31,339
Yeah. She looks… taller.

1036
00:52:35,969 --> 00:52:38,054
This is only a preview.

1037
00:52:38,346 --> 00:52:41,933
I've got another entire line I'll
debut at the real thing.

1038
00:52:43,017 --> 00:52:47,313
Why did you stop the–
Oh my goodness!

1039
00:52:47,772 --> 00:52:50,275
Attention, campers!

1040
00:52:50,275 --> 00:52:52,527
It's Gaia Everfree!

1041
00:52:52,527 --> 00:52:53,570
She's real!

1042
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,989
Aah! We're doomed!

1043
00:52:55,989 --> 00:52:59,993
Gloriosa?!
What are you doing?!

1044
00:52:59,993 --> 00:53:01,744
That's Gloriosa?

1045
00:53:01,744 --> 00:53:04,914
Am I going crazy or her feet
are not touching the ground?

1046
00:53:04,914 --> 00:53:07,208
Freaky-deaky!

1047
00:53:07,208 --> 00:53:09,836
I have an announcement to make!

1048
00:53:09,836 --> 00:53:11,546
Filthy Rich wants this

1049
00:53:11,546 --> 00:53:14,632
to be the last session
of Camp Everfree.

1050
00:53:14,632 --> 00:53:18,595
But don't worry, I got this!

1051
00:53:27,896 --> 00:53:30,773
Oh, come on!
We literally

1052
00:53:30,773 --> 00:53:32,650
just finished building that!

1053
00:53:33,067 --> 00:53:36,529
<i>♫ I have waited for the day ♫</i>

1054
00:53:36,529 --> 00:53:39,824
<i>♫ To send this greedy wolf away ♫</i>

1055
00:53:39,824 --> 00:53:43,036
<i>♫ Now the magic is my salvation ♫</i>

1056
00:53:43,036 --> 00:53:46,372

<i>♫ We will stand for Everfree! ♫</i>

1078
00:55:33,479 --> 00:55:35,940
Oh, why do these kind of things

1079
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,609
always happen to us?

1080
00:55:38,484 --> 00:55:40,236
What are we going to do?

1081
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:43,990
What we always do! Save the day!

1082
00:55:47,869 --> 00:55:50,038
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

1083
00:55:50,038 --> 00:55:51,539
This is gonna be so much fun!

1084
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:52,999
Oh, I only wish we had time

1085
00:55:52,999 --> 00:55:54,959
to make superhero capes!

1086
00:55:54,959 --> 00:55:56,628
Oh, me too!

1087
00:55:56,628 --> 00:55:58,838
Duh, enough about our wardrobe!

1088
00:55:58,838 --> 00:56:00,256
We've got to stop Gloriosa

1089
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:02,175
from trapping everybody in here!

1090
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:24,864
Um, hi. Do you think you can give us a hand– Um, or paw?

1091
00:56:24,864 --> 00:56:27,408
We could really use a way out.

1092
00:57:32,056 --> 00:57:35,476
This isn't working! Her magic is too strong!

1093
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:40,899
Nice work, Spike!

1094
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:47,906
Twilight, you have to use your magic!

1095
00:57:47,906 --> 00:57:50,283
I don't think I can lift something that big.

1096
00:57:50,283 --> 00:57:52,243
It's our only chance of getting out

1097
00:57:52,243 --> 00:57:54,078
of here and helping our friends!

1098
00:58:18,436 --> 00:58:20,980
Why are you fighting me?

1099
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:23,066
I'm doing this to save our camp!

1100
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,235
I'm doing this for you!

1101
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:28,905
Gloriosa, let's just think about this

1102
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:30,240
for a moment, shall we?

1103
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,661
I mean, I think Camp Everfree is absolutely delightful,

1104
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:35,870
but I just don't know if

1105
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:39,499
I'm quite ready to give up my weekly trips to the spa.

1106
00:58:39,499 --> 00:58:45,004
To the spa. TO THE SPA?!

1107
00:58:50,176 --> 00:58:53,096
Gloriosa, this isn't the way!

1108
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:58,017
I appreciate your concern, Timber, BUT I GOT THIS!

1109
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,815
No, you don't!

1110
00:59:10,196 --> 00:59:13,199
Twilight, do you think you can use your magic?

1111
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:15,368
I don't wanna use too much.

1112
00:59:15,368 --> 00:59:17,328
Midnight Sparkle could take over.

1113
00:59:17,412 --> 00:59:20,874
Twilight, our friends are in there!

1114
00:59:23,918 --> 00:59:25,086
Okay.

1115
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:34,220
Please, Gloriosa. What you're doing is crazy.

1116
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,014
You have to listen to me!

1117
00:59:36,014 --> 00:59:37,682
That isn't Gloriosa.

1118
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:43,021
Twilight!

1119
00:59:43,021 --> 00:59:43,646
Sunset!

1120
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:45,106
You're okay!

1121
00:59:45,106 --> 00:59:46,399
That isn't your sister.

1122
00:59:46,399 --> 00:59:49,235
It's someone who's been consumed by Equestrian magic.

1123
00:59:51,112 --> 00:59:54,073
Whoever you are, you have to let my sister go!

1124
00:59:54,115 --> 00:59:57,577
Please, Gloriosa, come back!
I need you!

1125
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:02,207
Gloriosa!

1126
01:00:13,927 --> 01:00:15,094
Rarity!

1127
01:00:19,432 --> 01:00:22,185
I can't keep this up forever!

1128
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:23,770
It's up to you.

1129
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:26,773
You can use your magic to pull the brambles apart!

1130
01:00:26,773 --> 01:00:28,900
No. There's too many of them.

1131
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,568
It would take too much magic.

1132
01:00:30,568 --> 01:00:31,694
I can't!

1133
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:33,071
It's the only way!

1134
01:00:33,071 --> 01:00:35,782
You have to embrace the magic inside you!

1135
01:00:35,782 --> 01:00:37,742
What if she takes over?

1136
01:00:37,742 --> 01:00:39,536
What if instead of saving everyone,

1137
01:00:39,536 --> 01:00:41,079
I'll turn into Midnight Sparkle

1138
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:42,288
and only make things worse?

1139
01:00:42,288 --> 01:00:45,583
That won't happen! We won't let it.

1140
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:59,055
Come on, Twilight! You have to be stronger than she is!

1141
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:08,815
You will never control me!

1142
01:01:08,815 --> 01:01:11,776
I will always be a part of you!

1143
01:01:15,321 --> 01:01:17,365
Nooo!

1144
01:01:17,615 --> 01:01:19,826
Twilight, listen to me!

1145
01:01:19,826 --> 01:01:21,786
You are in charge!

1146
01:01:21,786 --> 01:01:24,163
You are a light, darling!

1147
01:01:24,163 --> 01:01:26,207
A force for good!

1148
01:01:26,207 --> 01:01:29,335
Yeah! You can kick the darkness's butt!

1149
01:01:29,335 --> 01:01:31,754
We're here for you, Twilight!

1150
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:34,132
And we'll be here no matter what!

1151
01:01:34,132 --> 01:01:36,634
We believe in you!

1152
01:01:38,469 --> 01:01:42,557
You are not Midnight Sparkle!

1153
01:01:43,141 --> 01:01:48,104
No! I am Twilight Sparkle!

1154
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:50,190
And the magic I carry inside me

1155
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:53,985
is the magic of friendship!

1156
01:02:00,033 --> 01:02:03,161
No! Stop!

1157
01:02:50,416 --> 01:02:52,126
Gloriosa?

1158
01:02:54,254 --> 01:02:57,006
What… What happened?

1159
01:02:57,006 --> 01:03:00,677
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

1160
01:03:10,478 --> 01:03:14,065
You did it! Oh, nice bling.

1161
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,734
What… What are these?

1162
01:03:16,734 --> 01:03:18,069
I'm not sure.

1163
01:03:18,069 --> 01:03:21,114
But clearly we have some kind of connection to them.

1164
01:03:21,114 --> 01:03:25,618
I almost don't care what they are. They are gorgeous!

1165
01:03:25,618 --> 01:03:27,996
And will totally go with the other collection

1166
01:03:27,996 --> 01:03:30,290
I was working on for the camp fashion show!

1167
01:03:32,667 --> 01:03:36,045
That's probably canceled, isn't it?

1168
01:03:39,507 --> 01:03:43,219
I am so sorry. I only wanted this

1169
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:46,139
to be the best week Camp Everfree has ever had.

1170
01:03:46,139 --> 01:03:49,100
Then instead I've made it the worst.

1171
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,727
Maybe it's for the best that

1172
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:52,687
I'm losing the camp to Filthy Rich.

1173
01:03:52,687 --> 01:03:54,981
No, it's not.

1174
01:03:54,981 --> 01:03:58,067
This camp has meant so much to so many people,

1175
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:00,236
my sister and me included.

1176
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:03,698
Why do you think we wanted our students to come here?

1177
01:04:03,698 --> 01:04:06,576
We can't let Filthy Rich take this place away!

1178
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:08,828
If camp meant so much to you two,

1179
01:04:08,828 --> 01:04:10,663
maybe it meant as much to the other

1180
01:04:10,663 --> 01:04:12,790
campers who came here in years past?

1181
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:16,085
And maybe we can get them to help save it!

1182
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:18,129
Oh, like a fundraiser?

1183
01:04:18,129 --> 01:04:19,839
Or a ball?!

1184
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:21,466
Our band can play!

1185
01:04:21,466 --> 01:04:24,719
I can help writing a new song just for the occasion!

1186
01:04:28,556 --> 01:04:32,143
Those are all good ideas, but where would we hold it?

1187
01:04:32,143 --> 01:04:34,354
We can hold it in the crystal cave!

1188
01:04:34,354 --> 01:04:38,525
A crystal ball! I'm on it!

1189
01:04:38,775 --> 01:04:41,819
I admire everyone's enthusiasm, really,

1190
01:04:41,819 --> 01:04:44,531
I do, but I-I just don't know how we're going

1191
01:04:44,531 --> 01:04:47,116
to plan a ball by tomorrow and invite everyone.

1192
01:04:47,116 --> 01:04:49,118
We got this!

1193
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:00,713
<i>♫ I used to think that stories were just that ♫</i>

1194
01:05:00,964 --> 01:05:04,384

Thank you all so much for coming.

1228
01:07:21,813 --> 01:07:25,316
And for helping us raise enough money to…

1229
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:29,070
save Camp Everfree!

1230
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:35,326
Thank you for everything.

1231
01:07:35,326 --> 01:07:38,746
Oh, if I just asked for help in the first place.

1232
01:07:38,872 --> 01:07:41,916
Heh, don't sweat it, it's kinda what we do.

1233
01:07:49,841 --> 01:07:52,218
Not to brag or anything,

1234
01:07:52,218 --> 01:07:53,928
but it's pretty cool how I saved

1235
01:07:53,928 --> 01:07:56,806
all those campers from those Rubus fruticosus.

1236
01:07:56,931 --> 01:07:58,683
Blackberry brambles.

1237
01:07:58,683 --> 01:08:00,393
I'm familiar with the genus,

1238
01:08:00,393 --> 01:08:03,354
it's just a little weird you say you saved the campers.

1239
01:08:03,354 --> 01:08:04,939
I thought I saved them.

1240
01:08:04,939 --> 01:08:08,234
Yeah. But I saved you from falling on the docks,

1241
01:08:08,234 --> 01:08:09,986
so that you can save the campers.

1242
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:12,530
So technically, it was all me.

1243
01:08:14,741 --> 01:08:16,701
I'm really glad I met you.

1244
01:08:17,911 --> 01:08:18,786
Uh-oh.

1245
01:08:19,037 --> 01:08:19,913
What?

1246
01:08:19,913 --> 01:08:22,415
That sounds like a goodbye.

1247
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:26,419
And here I was hoping we'd still be able to hang out.

1248
01:08:26,669 --> 01:08:29,797
Maybe get dinner and catch a movie?

1249
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:34,552
Yeah. I'd really like that.

1250
01:08:35,094 --> 01:08:38,348
Oh, good! I was hoping that's what this meant.

1251
01:08:45,897 --> 01:08:50,610
Oh, uh,  sorry. I need to borrow Timber.

1252
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:53,071
There are some donors I really want him to meet.

1253
01:08:53,071 --> 01:08:55,573
They were good friends with mom and dad.

1254
01:08:57,116 --> 01:08:59,827
Save me a dance, okay?

1255
01:09:00,245 --> 01:09:01,579
Uh-hah.

1256
01:09:01,955 --> 01:09:03,998
Adorable.

1257
01:09:03,998 --> 01:09:06,084
He does seem like a pretty cool guy.

1258
01:09:06,084 --> 01:09:07,961
You know what else is cool?

1259
01:09:07,961 --> 01:09:09,546
Our awesome new superpowers!

1260
01:09:10,463 --> 01:09:12,340
I handed out, like, four hundred fliers,

1261
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:14,217
set up the stage,

1262
01:09:14,509 --> 01:09:16,678
and still had time to pick up pizza!

1263
01:09:16,678 --> 01:09:18,763
I love my superspeed!

1264
01:09:18,763 --> 01:09:20,974
About that. I think the crystals

1265
01:09:20,974 --> 01:09:22,934
are the source of the superpowers.

1266
01:09:22,934 --> 01:09:25,687
You're not gonna ask us to give them up, are you?

1267
01:09:25,687 --> 01:09:29,190
No. In fact, I think maybe we were

1268
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:30,775
meant to have them all along?

1269
01:09:30,775 --> 01:09:32,110
Me too.

1270
01:09:43,329 --> 01:09:46,666
There is one thing I'm still wondering about, though.

1271
01:09:46,666 --> 01:09:47,584
What's that?

1272
01:09:47,584 --> 01:09:51,504
Where did the magic that hit this cave come from?

1309
01:12:41,299 --> 01:12:43,134
Third time is a charm.

1310
01:12:43,301 --> 01:12:44,552
Or is it fifth?

1311
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:45,803
I've lost track.

1312
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:48,473
All that matters is that
the runway is finished.

1313
01:12:48,848 --> 01:12:50,725
I think you mean "the dock"?

1314
01:12:50,892 --> 01:12:53,061
Oh, tomahto, tomato.

1315
01:12:53,394 --> 01:12:55,480
Let's celebrate!
