1
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:02,981
- Well, I'm delighted
to have in the studio with me today

2
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:05,776
award-winning photojournalist Kevin Carter.

3
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:09,279
We've read a lot
about the so called Bang Bang Club.

4
00:01:09,447 --> 00:01:12,282
Is there in fact such a club?

5
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,285
- Um, I mean, this, it's just a label.

6
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:17,245
I mean, almost a joke really.

7
00:01:17,413 --> 00:01:20,874
Somebody called us that, and...
We go out together...

8
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:22,584
on assignments

9
00:01:22,752 --> 00:01:23,794
and so we're always together.

10
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:25,671
You know, safety in numbers.
That's the idea.

11
00:01:25,838 --> 00:01:28,173
- And are you competitive
amongst yourselves?

12
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:30,509
I mean, do you compete?
- Oh yeah.

13
00:01:30,677 --> 00:01:32,594
Everybody, at the end of the day,

14
00:01:32,762 --> 00:01:34,596
wants to come back
with the best shot.

15
00:01:34,764 --> 00:01:39,434
- So Kevin, what do you think
makes a photograph great?

16
00:01:39,602 --> 00:01:41,311
- Hmm...

17
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:47,609
- Kevin?

18
00:02:14,637 --> 00:02:18,306
(radio): Soweto residents say that
in the early hours of this morning,

19
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:21,560
members of the Inkatha Freedom Party
attacked sections of Soweto,

20
00:02:21,728 --> 00:02:24,730
known to be sympathetic to the ANC.

21
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:27,065
Armed with hangers and spears
and wearing their signature red headbands,

22
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:30,986
the Inkatha warriors marched
into a number of residential areas--

23
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,457
(people shouting)

24
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:49,546
(screeching tires)

25
00:02:55,595 --> 00:02:56,678
- Go!

26
00:03:01,851 --> 00:03:28,251
(people shouting)

27
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:42,390
(camera shutter clicking)

28
00:03:50,316 --> 00:03:52,108
- Hey, bru!
Get out of my fuckin' frame.

29
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:53,652
- Sorry!

30
00:03:58,282 --> 00:04:00,242
- Who are you?
- Greg Marinovich.

31
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:02,452
- Kevin. Kevin Carter.

32
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,788
- Pleasure.
(camera shutters clicking)

33
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:11,545
- Who are you working for?
- I'm freelance.

34
00:04:11,712 --> 00:04:12,712
- No shit.

35
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:14,965
Hey, are we finished here?
- Yeah.

36
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:17,175
- Looks like it.

37
00:04:21,097 --> 00:04:23,431
- Ignore him.
Chief photographer at The Star.

38
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:25,058
- Yeah, I know.

39
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:27,727
- Now he's all pissed off
'cause he missed the action.

40
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:29,771
- Kevin, you ready?
- Coming!

41
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:37,320
Forget the long lens, bru.
Stuff only looks good up close.

42
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:39,364
Good luck.

43
00:04:39,532 --> 00:04:41,157
- Thanks, bru.

44
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,249
(singing in the background)

45
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:04,848
Hey, gents.

46
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:10,186
Why'd they kill him?

47
00:05:11,314 --> 00:05:13,189
- They don't need a reason.

48
00:05:13,357 --> 00:05:14,983
We are ANC and they are Inkatha.

49
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:16,651
Zulus.

50
00:05:19,322 --> 00:05:20,655
- Thanks.

51
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:24,326
- Where are you going?

52
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:26,995
- I'm going to go talk to them,
in the hostel.

53
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:29,831
- That's a shortcut to heaven.

54
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:33,168
- Ah well. I want to see for myself.

55
00:05:33,336 --> 00:05:34,878
(boy speaking in local dialect)

56
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:37,714
What's that mean?

57
00:05:37,882 --> 00:05:40,342
- I'll tell them what happened to you.

58
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:01,863
(dog barking)

59
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,023
- Hello.

60
00:06:57,837 --> 00:06:59,295
(speaking in local dialect)

61
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:13,518
(people shouting)

62
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:18,732
(fast-paced music, drum beats)

63
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:42,505
Hello.

64
00:07:42,673 --> 00:07:44,299
- What do you want here, man?

65
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:45,383
- I'm press.

66
00:07:45,551 --> 00:07:47,635
I'm press.
(speaking in local dialect)

67
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:50,388
Please, please...
- Ay, ay, ay, ay...

68
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:53,600
- I'm a photographer.
I just... I just want to talk.

69
00:07:57,813 --> 00:07:58,897
(speaks indistinctly)

70
00:07:59,065 --> 00:08:00,315
Why are you here?

71
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:04,152
- I'm a photographer.
I'm just looking for some pictures.

72
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:08,073
(local dialect)

73
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,742
(laughter)
(men conversing with each other)

74
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:16,498
- Sit down.

75
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,501
- Thanks.
- Yeah...

76
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:20,627
- Hey, what's this?

77
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:23,546
(men conversing in local dialect)

78
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:33,056
(whistling)
(man raising his voice)

79
00:08:37,186 --> 00:08:39,521
(laughter)

80
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:41,856
- Drink, drink, drink.

81
00:08:46,195 --> 00:08:47,987
(laughter)

82
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:51,950
(local dialect)

83
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:52,784
(laughter)

84
00:08:52,952 --> 00:08:55,537
- What are you going to do
with our picture?

85
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,541
- I want to tell
Inkatha's side of the story.

86
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,877
(local dialect)

87
00:09:09,718 --> 00:09:11,678
- Why you don't do
like all the other journalists do?

88
00:09:11,846 --> 00:09:15,056
They're going to the township
and they speak to the clevers,

89
00:09:15,224 --> 00:09:16,808
the ANC comrades. Why?
- No, no, no.

90
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:18,768
I want to hear your side of the story.

91
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:20,979
Can I ask what happened today?

92
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:23,731
(local dialect)

93
00:09:29,238 --> 00:09:32,740
- You must listen
and I want you to understand.

94
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:35,243
You see?

95
00:09:35,411 --> 00:09:39,080
We, we come here for one reason.

96
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:40,748
One reason only.

97
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,083
To work.

98
00:09:42,251 --> 00:09:46,087
And these comrades, the Mandela boys,

99
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:49,340
they are telling us
not to go to work.

100
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:52,552
They say we must join the stay-away.

101
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,264
Now what if we get expelled
from our jobs?

102
00:09:57,391 --> 00:10:00,435
Are they going to give us money
to take care of our children?

103
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:04,105
Are they going to give us money
to take care of our families back home?

104
00:10:04,273 --> 00:10:08,276
(men shouting,
agreeing with each other in local dialect)

105
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:15,283
- My brother was stopped by this comrade.

106
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:19,120
He was from the shop,
carrying the plastic bag full of food.

107
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:21,664
They told him that
there was a boycott,

108
00:10:21,832 --> 00:10:25,126
so he should not go and buy food.

109
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:26,878
After that, you know what they did?

110
00:10:27,713 --> 00:10:30,632
They made him drink cooking oil
and paraffin

111
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,177
and also they pushed
washing powder in his mouth.

112
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:36,054
(local dialect)

113
00:10:36,222 --> 00:10:37,722
(shouting angrily)

114
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:41,309
(chanting)

115
00:10:42,645 --> 00:10:45,313
(local dialect)

116
00:10:47,441 --> 00:10:50,818
- What kind of a place is this

117
00:10:50,986 --> 00:10:54,614
where children,
they tell their elders what to do?

118
00:10:54,782 --> 00:10:58,826
I mean, what kind of a place is this
where children do not obey their parents?

119
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:01,704
Today we taught them a very good lesson.

120
00:11:01,872 --> 00:11:04,332
(men shouting in local dialect)

121
00:11:07,002 --> 00:11:09,254
(cheering and shouting)

122
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:15,009
(rhythmic music)

123
00:11:18,055 --> 00:11:20,014
(camera shutter clicking)

124
00:11:40,035 --> 00:11:42,203
(laughter)

125
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:00,805
(camera shutter clicking)

126
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:12,233
- Ay, ay, ay, ay...
(local dialect)

127
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:15,236
- No?
(local dialect)

128
00:12:15,404 --> 00:12:17,238
Okay, okay.

129
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:20,408
(cheering and shouting)

130
00:12:21,076 --> 00:12:23,578
(whistling)

131
00:12:29,251 --> 00:12:30,752
(people shouting)

132
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,596
What's going on?

133
00:12:41,764 --> 00:12:43,765
- He's the enemy.
He's been shooting at everybody.

134
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:46,726
- I don't hear any shots.
(local dialect)

135
00:12:46,894 --> 00:12:49,062
(shouting)

136
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,819
(camera shutter clicking)

137
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:55,586
(local dialect)

138
00:13:56,463 --> 00:13:58,005
- Not a problem. Not a problem.

139
00:13:58,173 --> 00:13:59,799
(local dialect)

140
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:04,637
(singing, whistling)

141
00:14:40,466 --> 00:14:42,800
- He's not Zulu.

142
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:46,179
He's a Xhosa like Mandela.
He deserves to die.

143
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:51,476
Goodbye, my friend.

144
00:14:56,565 --> 00:14:59,358
(local dialect)

145
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:01,986
- Shoot us.

146
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:10,745
(camera shutter clicking)

147
00:15:10,913 --> 00:15:12,455
(local dialect)

148
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,288
- I'm looking for the photo editor.
- Just in there.

149
00:15:59,628 --> 00:16:01,254
(knocking)
- Excuse me?

150
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:04,840
I'm looking for the photo editor.

151
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:07,093
- I'm Robin Comley.

152
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:08,719
I'm the picture editor.

153
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:11,514
- Hey. My new china.
How's it?

154
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:13,933
- How's it, bru?
- What do you want, man?

155
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:16,602
- I've got some pictures
from inside the hostel.

156
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,272
- In the hostel?
You don't mean inside?

157
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:21,357
- Yeah, inside.
- Are you serious?

158
00:16:21,525 --> 00:16:22,733
- Fuck.

159
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:25,695
You must be out of your mind.

160
00:16:25,862 --> 00:16:27,154
- Let's see them.

161
00:16:27,322 --> 00:16:29,198
Ken, show him the dark room.

162
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:30,992
- Let's go.

163
00:16:33,328 --> 00:16:34,412
- Went in!

164
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,873
- They're fantastic, Ron.

165
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,042
- Absolutely.

166
00:16:41,336 --> 00:16:42,920
Oh, fuck me. I can't use them.

167
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:46,924
Our readers might find it a bit much
over their Rice Krispies tomorrow morning.

168
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,552
- Ron, are you ever gonna grow some?

169
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,556
- We can use this one and this one
as a Sunday feature.

170
00:16:53,724 --> 00:16:56,225
We don't get images like this every day.

171
00:16:56,393 --> 00:16:57,810
- Yeah. All right. Maybe.

172
00:16:57,978 --> 00:16:59,729
Just show me a layout.

173
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:03,024
- The framing's weak.

174
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:04,609
Half of them are soft.

175
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:07,028
Kev.

176
00:17:10,032 --> 00:17:11,574
Greg, do you have a portfolio?

177
00:17:11,742 --> 00:17:13,117
- Sure.

178
00:17:13,285 --> 00:17:15,161
- So which way did you get in, bru?

179
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:17,455
- I could see where they were going
and I just followed them.

180
00:17:17,623 --> 00:17:19,540
- So did anyone stop you?

181
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,709
Were they cool with you?
- I thought they were going to kill me, yeah,

182
00:17:21,877 --> 00:17:23,586
but I could shoot for the most part.
- Fuck!

183
00:17:23,754 --> 00:17:25,671
-It's not bad.
- Fucking Speen is back, man.

184
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,382
- I was shooting some old time rituals.

185
00:17:30,385 --> 00:17:31,594
It's a circumcision ceremony there.

186
00:17:31,762 --> 00:17:34,138
- You shoot colour too, huh?

187
00:17:34,306 --> 00:17:37,099
- Yeah, but this isn't the F64 club, bru.

188
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:40,895
- Yeah, what he means is our shit
doesn't sit still. Not like this.

189
00:17:42,522 --> 00:17:43,606
I like this stuff.

190
00:17:43,774 --> 00:17:45,191
It’s not bad.

191
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:47,735
Okay, I'm out of here.

192
00:17:49,237 --> 00:17:51,572
I think it's going to be better
if we go in earlier.

193
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,866
Everybody else can sleep late
and file shit.

194
00:17:56,078 --> 00:17:57,203
I'll see you there, bru.

195
00:17:58,747 --> 00:18:01,123
Cheers, Rob.
- Cheers.

196
00:18:04,753 --> 00:18:07,004
- Joao. Joao Silva.

197
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,173
- Pleasure.

198
00:18:09,341 --> 00:18:10,341
- Well...

199
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:15,971
I told you to get in close, didn't I?
- You did, yeah.

200
00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:18,933
- Well done, bru. Well done.

201
00:18:19,101 --> 00:18:22,269
The, ah... the bill...
I don't have my wallet...

202
00:18:22,437 --> 00:18:24,271
- I got it, Kev, I got it.
- Thank you.

203
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:29,151
- Did I just get a job?

204
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:31,320
- No. Only Ken and Kevin are full-time.

205
00:18:31,488 --> 00:18:35,282
But I'll give you the same deal as Joao.
On days that you work for us,

206
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,618
I'll pay you a day rate.

207
00:18:37,786 --> 00:18:40,621
You get paid the same if we use
all of your pics or none of them.

208
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:42,331
But you can sell
what we don't to AP or Reuters.

209
00:18:42,499 --> 00:18:45,251
That's where you make your real money.

210
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:48,879
Here. It’s for today's pics.

211
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:52,800
Shit.

212
00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:57,304
- Why did you go out there today?

213
00:18:57,472 --> 00:18:59,724
- Because it scared me.

214
00:18:59,891 --> 00:19:03,310
- Because it scared you?

215
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:05,479
Do you always do things
just because they scare you?

216
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:08,023
- Not always, but sometimes.

217
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:12,903
Can I buy you dinner?

218
00:19:14,823 --> 00:19:16,157
- Can you afford to buy me dinner?

219
00:19:16,324 --> 00:19:17,908
- Oh, I can now.

220
00:19:20,162 --> 00:19:23,581
- This time I'll buy you dinner.
Use that to buy yourself a better camera.

221
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,835
We'll have to make it quick.
I have to be back at work in 40 minutes.

222
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:35,676
(camera shutter clicking)

223
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:02,119
- Why don't you just get a new strap, bru?
- Because it's leather.

224
00:20:05,582 --> 00:20:07,875
I'm ready. I'm ready.

225
00:20:09,544 --> 00:20:11,253
- The new guy.

226
00:20:11,421 --> 00:20:13,631
- How's it?
- New gear?

227
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,217
- Yeah.
- Oh.

228
00:20:16,384 --> 00:20:18,219
Ready for some fun?

229
00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:20,304
One second.

230
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,725
It protects...

231
00:20:24,893 --> 00:20:29,522
the advance mechanism on the bottom.

232
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:32,566
I just saved you money on resale, bru.

233
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:34,235
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

234
00:20:41,576 --> 00:20:42,701
- How's it, Greg?

235
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:43,828
- How's it?

236
00:20:43,995 --> 00:20:45,162
- Nice camera, man.
- Thanks, bru.

237
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,664
- So what's the weather report?

238
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:48,457
- They say there's
about 2,000 Inkatha warriors

239
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,750
two clicks from here.

240
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:51,252
They're heavily armed.
They're on their way to the comrades.

241
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:52,461
Let's go.

242
00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:54,463
- Yeah.
- Let's go!

243
00:21:03,265 --> 00:21:04,765
- Hey, Joao, is that a fucking scanner?

244
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:06,141
- Yeah.

245
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:08,018
- You're a criminal degenerate,
you know that?

246
00:21:08,186 --> 00:21:09,728
(chuckling)
If the cops catch us with that,

247
00:21:09,896 --> 00:21:11,772
they'll put us in fucking jail, man.
- Well if they stop us,

248
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,192
it belongs to the new guy.
- Thanks.

249
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,819
-It's down there.

250
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:18,445
Right there.

251
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:20,573
- Ah, what have we got here?

252
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:32,126
(people shouting, banging on the van)

253
00:21:32,294 --> 00:21:33,294
- This is fun.

254
00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:35,504
- Just smile and be cool.

255
00:21:37,215 --> 00:21:39,216
Press on foot. Press.

256
00:21:39,384 --> 00:21:41,302
It’s press, eh?

257
00:21:42,637 --> 00:21:43,721
Press on foot.

258
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:45,306
Press.

259
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:50,269
Press, eh? Press.
- They're using muti.

260
00:21:50,437 --> 00:21:52,104
(singing)

261
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:53,856
- They think it makes them invulnerable.

262
00:21:56,568 --> 00:21:59,153
- That's where they are, on the right.

263
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:01,447
- Ah, shit. Here they come.
- All right.

264
00:22:01,615 --> 00:22:03,616
- Just park on the right there.
- Yeah.

265
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,619
(sighing)

266
00:22:06,786 --> 00:22:08,495
- Okay. Here we go.

267
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,919
(people shouting)

268
00:22:46,368 --> 00:22:47,534
- You ready?

269
00:22:47,702 --> 00:22:48,953
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

270
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,412
- Yeah.

271
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,374
(people singing, cheering)

272
00:22:57,921 --> 00:22:59,338
(whistling)

273
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:10,557
Watch him.

274
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:12,393
It’s all about reading the moment.

275
00:23:15,105 --> 00:23:16,897
Watch him, man. He's the best.

276
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:19,733
He always works from the outside in.

277
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:21,485
(camera shutter clicking)

278
00:23:28,535 --> 00:23:30,160
And when it peaks...

279
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:35,833
You're there.

280
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:39,962
It’s a thing of beauty, my friend.

281
00:23:41,047 --> 00:23:43,424
Then, you shoot a black frame.

282
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:47,261
That just simply tells the desk
that's your best shot.

283
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:52,474
Let's go find one ourselves. Huh?

284
00:23:55,395 --> 00:23:57,938
(crowd screaming)

285
00:24:11,244 --> 00:24:13,412
(gunfire, screaming)

286
00:24:18,877 --> 00:24:20,627
- That's an army-issue R1 .

287
00:24:21,546 --> 00:24:23,630
- Where the fuck are they getting the guns?

288
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:26,175
- What the fuck do you care, man?
It doesn't matter.

289
00:24:26,342 --> 00:24:27,509
Just take the picture.

290
00:24:27,677 --> 00:24:29,053
(camera shutter clicking)

291
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,472
(singing, screaming, gunfire)

292
00:24:32,891 --> 00:24:35,142
(camera shutters clicking)

293
00:24:37,729 --> 00:24:38,937
(gunfire)

294
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:47,529
- I guess the muti isn't working so well
this morning.

295
00:24:47,697 --> 00:24:49,990
- They still think it's working fine,
just not for them.

296
00:24:50,158 --> 00:24:52,076
(gunfire, singing, screaming)

297
00:24:53,078 --> 00:24:54,912
(metallic noise)

298
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:25,192
(trucks approaching)

299
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,921
(machine-gun fire)

300
00:25:47,257 --> 00:25:50,968
(people shouting)

301
00:26:19,622 --> 00:26:21,081
(camera shutter clicking)

302
00:26:22,584 --> 00:26:24,459
- Go.

303
00:26:29,924 --> 00:26:32,593
(camera shutter clicking)

304
00:26:36,055 --> 00:26:37,639
(gunfire)

305
00:27:00,371 --> 00:27:02,122
- Can't you at least pretend
to be scared?

306
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,291
(gunfire)
(chuckling)

307
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:32,319
(rock music)

308
00:27:59,347 --> 00:28:00,555
- Cool.

309
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:03,517
I heard about this new disco

310
00:28:04,686 --> 00:28:07,688
So I really wanted to dance

311
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:10,148
I just want to go in
and see my friend Romeo in there

312
00:28:10,316 --> 00:28:11,733
Hiya

313
00:28:11,901 --> 00:28:13,277
But when I phoned up my honey

314
00:28:14,362 --> 00:28:16,029
She kept talking to me
about other men

315
00:28:16,197 --> 00:28:18,907
- Come, let's grab a drink.
Let's get a drink.

316
00:28:19,075 --> 00:28:21,618
It made me sore
I couldn't believe my ears

317
00:28:21,786 --> 00:28:24,579
So I felt real mad. . .

318
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:28,375
- Joao!

319
00:28:30,712 --> 00:28:32,754
Hi, I'm Viv. You must be Greg.

320
00:28:32,922 --> 00:28:34,214
- Yeah, hi.

321
00:28:34,382 --> 00:28:37,718
- So you decided to join up
with these crazies, eh?

322
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:40,637
(laughter)
- Ken!

323
00:28:40,805 --> 00:28:41,847
- I want you meet someone.

324
00:28:43,808 --> 00:28:45,183
- So is this the young man?

325
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:47,728
- Greg, this is Alf Khumalo.

326
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:49,730
-It's really nice to meet you, sir.
It’s an honor.

327
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:51,606
I know your photographs well.

328
00:28:51,774 --> 00:28:53,400
- How are you feeling
with our big chief?

329
00:28:53,568 --> 00:28:56,194
- You're not gonna tell him
what a racist bastard I am, are you?

330
00:28:56,362 --> 00:28:59,740
- Well, you still young, Ken,
you'll get over it, you know.

331
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:01,992
- So Ken, another whitey photographer
making money

332
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,286
off the spilled blood of Africans, eh?

333
00:29:04,662 --> 00:29:06,913
- Ah, Sonny. Cool it.

334
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:08,999
(local dialect)

335
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,169
Let him be.

336
00:29:12,337 --> 00:29:13,712
- Fuck it. I'm too thirsty
to have this argument.

337
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,216
Promised this oke a drink.
Alf, Sonny, Thoko.

338
00:29:18,384 --> 00:29:18,925
- Cheers.

339
00:29:19,093 --> 00:29:21,345
- See you guys later.
- Welcome, Greg.

340
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:22,679
- Thanks, sir.

341
00:29:24,432 --> 00:29:25,766
- Two beers, please.

342
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:28,435
- Whew, what was that about?

343
00:29:29,771 --> 00:29:31,313
- Ah, it's much harder
if you're a black photographer.

344
00:29:31,481 --> 00:29:32,773
- Here you go.
- There you go, bru.

345
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,940
- Thanks.

346
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:37,486
- If you're an Inkatha supporter,
the ANC comrades want to kill you.

347
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:40,113
If you're ANC,
the Inkatha Zulus want to kill you.

348
00:29:40,281 --> 00:29:41,573
So really, there's always somebody

349
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:43,825
who wants to kill you.
Doesn't matter whose side you're on.

350
00:29:43,993 --> 00:29:46,203
And you...

351
00:29:46,371 --> 00:29:47,913
You're lucky 'cause you're white.

352
00:29:48,081 --> 00:29:49,956
As you've shown,

353
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:52,709
you can go anywhere.

354
00:29:53,503 --> 00:29:55,504
School's out, china. Let's drink.

355
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:57,631
Cheers, man.
- Cheers!

356
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,051
- You're Ken Oosterbroek, aren't you?

357
00:30:01,219 --> 00:30:02,135
Yeah.

358
00:30:02,303 --> 00:30:03,887
- Hi.
- Hi.

359
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:09,309
(clears throat)

360
00:30:09,477 --> 00:30:12,145
- This is Greg. Greg, Sam.

361
00:30:12,313 --> 00:30:13,355
- Pleasure.

362
00:30:13,523 --> 00:30:15,273
(humming)

363
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,822
Where will you be
when the saviour comes

364
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:26,493
Will you be on your knees
or behind a gun

365
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:31,331
Will you be happy to see him

366
00:30:31,499 --> 00:30:33,834
Or will you want to run

367
00:30:35,628 --> 00:30:39,256
Will you be afraid
of what the people say

368
00:30:39,424 --> 00:30:44,094
When you look
at what the people have done

369
00:30:45,638 --> 00:30:48,223
And if you chance

370
00:30:48,391 --> 00:30:52,060
To meet him

371
00:30:52,228 --> 00:30:55,939
Will you know he's the one

372
00:30:58,192 --> 00:31:02,529
That you have been seeking

373
00:31:04,282 --> 00:31:07,492
Is it love
Whoa whoa whoa

374
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,537
Whoa whoa
That you want

375
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:16,042
Will you feel his spirit in the air

376
00:31:17,545 --> 00:31:20,380
Will it take you...

377
00:31:20,548 --> 00:31:22,549
Na na na na na na...

378
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:33,226
-It's Kevin's.

379
00:31:34,437 --> 00:31:36,188
-It's great.
- Yeah.

380
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:38,773
Come and see this.

381
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:43,653
I'm calling it Our Hidden War.

382
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:47,574
These are the shots I'm gonna use.

383
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:51,161
Three of them are yours.

384
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:56,249
- Shit.

385
00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:02,005
You should use this one too.

386
00:32:02,173 --> 00:32:04,090
- Hands off.

387
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:06,092
- And, ah... that one.

388
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,844
- Stop. Stop it.

389
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:12,265
- They'll never let you run this.
- They have to.

390
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:14,559
These pictures are gonna show up
on front pages all over the world.

391
00:32:14,727 --> 00:32:17,646
We'll look like idiots
if we don't use them ourselves.

392
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:20,440
We don't know
what the government will do.

393
00:32:20,608 --> 00:32:21,566
(sighing)

394
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:23,527
We have no idea
what we can get away with.

395
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:28,615
- Oh, so you want to see
what you can get away with?

396
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,286
- You're a fucking troublemaker,
you know that?

397
00:32:34,956 --> 00:32:37,123
- Is it?
- Yeah.

398
00:32:38,626 --> 00:32:40,126
I don't date photographers.

399
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:43,213
- Yeah?

400
00:32:43,381 --> 00:32:44,673
- You keep terrible hours,

401
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,969
you drink too much and you're crazy.

402
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:52,347
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

403
00:32:52,515 --> 00:32:54,641
And then there's some bad stuff too.

404
00:32:55,685 --> 00:32:56,851
(sighing)

405
00:33:08,406 --> 00:33:09,948
(paper flapping)

406
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:18,498
(rock music)

407
00:33:28,384 --> 00:33:33,346
- Not too much to report
but anger and pain

408
00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:35,515
and thinking,
"Where's the way out?"

409
00:33:36,684 --> 00:33:38,685
How do we get out of this mess?

410
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:45,108
Bloody little daylight in the daylight,
if you catch my drift.

411
00:33:45,276 --> 00:33:48,528
But tonight, my brus,

412
00:33:48,696 --> 00:33:51,031
tonight the moon is high.

413
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:54,534
You can see the new century
coming towards us

414
00:33:54,702 --> 00:34:00,040
and it sounds like this.

415
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:03,293
(rock music)

416
00:34:17,892 --> 00:34:20,477
Can't get the stink off

417
00:34:20,645 --> 00:34:22,979
He's been hanging round for days

418
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:27,984
Comes like a comet

419
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:31,071
Suckered you but not your friends

420
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:32,989
- You don't tell anyone about this.

421
00:34:34,742 --> 00:34:37,494
One day he'll get to you
and teach you...

422
00:34:37,662 --> 00:34:41,081
- She knows what she's doing.
Anyway, it's about time.

423
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:44,918
- You know, I always thought
it was gonna be me.

424
00:34:45,086 --> 00:34:47,921
- Kev, it was never gonna be you, man.

425
00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:50,090
- But Robin and the new guy?

426
00:34:51,759 --> 00:34:53,009
- Yeah, the new guy.

427
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:54,928
(laughing)

428
00:34:55,096 --> 00:34:56,513
- How's it?
- How's it?

429
00:34:56,681 --> 00:34:57,806
- Yeah. How's it?!

430
00:34:57,973 --> 00:34:59,391
- Out with it!
- Come on!

431
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:01,601
- What? What?
- Sex with Robin.

432
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:03,436
Okay, we make you join our little club
and then...

433
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:06,856
- You're in the club now.
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

434
00:35:07,024 --> 00:35:08,358
(rhythmic music)

435
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:11,319
Bang bang

436
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:13,071
(camera shutter clicking)

437
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:15,198
Bang bang...

438
00:35:33,092 --> 00:35:33,967
(weeping)

439
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:40,724
(rhythmic music continues)

440
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:12,672
You're mad.

441
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,466
There's cops in there.

442
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:19,929
- Go on,

443
00:36:20,097 --> 00:36:22,348
they're too shit scared to come out.

444
00:36:23,184 --> 00:36:25,185
Believe me.

445
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:46,164
(man in vehicle):It's marijuana!

446
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:08,228
- Did you catch my show last night?

447
00:37:08,938 --> 00:37:13,566
Every... fucking cut, every one.

448
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,738
Stones, every cut.

449
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:20,240
- Kevin, do you ever sleep?

450
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:23,409
Can you believe it?
Can you fucking believe it?

451
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:25,745
- Kev, shut up.
(woman wailing)

452
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:50,436
- Shadows.

453
00:37:50,604 --> 00:38:16,546
(camera shutter clicking)

454
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:27,599
Fuck!
- What's wrong?

455
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:32,812
- I thought he was still alive.

456
00:38:33,689 --> 00:38:37,191
- He's dead.
It’s just a body spasm.

457
00:38:38,903 --> 00:38:39,903
(camera shutter clicking)

458
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,322
Kev, if you've got the shot,
move on, man.

459
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:51,414
(clears throat)

460
00:38:58,088 --> 00:38:58,796
(shutter clicking)

461
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,641
(train approaching)

462
00:40:02,695 --> 00:40:03,653
- Ugh!

463
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:11,786
- Who is he?
- He's Inkatha.

464
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:13,871
- Are you sure?
- He's Zulu.

465
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:15,790
- Yeah he's Zulu,
but how do you know he's Inkatha?

466
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:17,667
- We know him. We are sure.

467
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:20,420
(kicking)
- Ugh! Ugh!

468
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:24,382
(camera shutter clicking)

469
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:28,094
(stabbing)

470
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:33,599
- Stop it! Stop!

471
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:35,226
- Stop taking pictures.

472
00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:37,186
- Yeah, I'll stop taking pictures
when you stop killing him.

473
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:38,688
- You saw what they did to us.

474
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:40,898
- What if he's not guilty?
- Doesn't matter.

475
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:50,199
It will be a warning
for the next ones.

476
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:54,078
(mob yelling)

477
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,751
(thud)

478
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:01,044
(camera shutter clicking)
(man groaning)

479
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,266
- Greg, behind you!

480
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:18,936
Greg!

481
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,230
Get out of there!

482
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:28,780
(camera shutter clicking)

483
00:41:54,807 --> 00:41:57,767
- Oh fuck. Oh fuck.

484
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:05,858
He's burning. He's burning.

485
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:12,198
So I ran after him.
The sun was right behind him.

486
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,620
Didn't have time to check my meter,
so I press the button.

487
00:42:17,788 --> 00:42:20,206
I just kept thinking F 5.6, F 5.6.

488
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:24,043
I started to frame for my next shot.

489
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:27,213
Just then, this guy runs up
with a fucking panga...

490
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:30,842
and brings it down on his head.

491
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:36,806
- You're shaking.

492
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:40,977
- But at least I've got the pictures.

493
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:46,315
- Greg you know we're not going to be able
to use the pictures.

494
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:50,027
They're too graphic.
- Then what the fuck am I doing out there?

495
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:52,738
It wasn't my call.
- Yeah, I know, but fuck!

496
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:54,323
(applause)

497
00:42:54,491 --> 00:42:55,491
- Ah, there he is!

498
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:56,742
There's the little fucker.

499
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,953
- It was fucking mal
out there today, huh?

500
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:01,122
- Okay.

501
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:02,874
Tell him.

502
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:05,001
- I sent your pictures to AP,
they sent it to London.

503
00:43:05,169 --> 00:43:07,170
They wanted every fucking shot
you took today.

504
00:43:07,337 --> 00:43:09,255
Do you know what that means?
- What?

505
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:11,299
- Your shots all over the world.

506
00:43:11,466 --> 00:43:12,884
(laughter)
- You're joking.

507
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:13,968
-It's payday, buddy.

508
00:43:14,136 --> 00:43:16,095
- A joke...
- Money! Money, baby!

509
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:18,639
- Yes! Woo!
- Yes! Greg!

510
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:20,933
You did it!

511
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:23,269
(rhythmic music)
Bang bang...

512
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:50,421
- Robin Comly.

513
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:55,927
Robin Comly, is she here?

514
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:00,056
- Yes.

515
00:44:00,224 --> 00:44:03,351
I'm Robin.
- I'm looking for Greg Marinovich.

516
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:06,520
- What do you want him for?

517
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:09,440
- He has taken a photograph of a crime.
I want him and the rolls of film.

518
00:44:09,608 --> 00:44:11,943
- Greg is freelance.
He comes and goes.

519
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:14,904
And we didn't use
this particular picture,

520
00:44:15,072 --> 00:44:16,489
so I don't think we can help you.

521
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:18,282
- A crime was committed.

522
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,533
A man brutally murdered.

523
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:22,536
We intend to obtain his photographs
and identify the perpetrators.

524
00:44:22,704 --> 00:44:24,413
I have here a 205 subpoena

525
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:27,625
which compels Mr. Marinovich
to testify or face arrest.

526
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:32,004
By law, you must sign
to acknowledge receipt.

527
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:39,345
Make sure he gets it.

528
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:48,896
- Shit.
- We've got no choice.

529
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:51,983
We have to notify the police
that we've seen you.

530
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:53,901
- Are you okay?

531
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:56,195
- I don't know, bru.
- What you gonna do?

532
00:44:56,363 --> 00:44:58,155
- I'm not fucking testifying.

533
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:00,700
I mean, I don't like what they did,
but I'm not fucking helping the cops.

534
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:01,993
- Just give them the photographs.

535
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,078
- Fuck that.
- What do you want to be a hero for?

536
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:10,334
- There's only one reason
why he shouldn't.

537
00:45:10,502 --> 00:45:13,879
If he gives them the photographs
and if he testifies,

538
00:45:14,047 --> 00:45:17,049
the next day, in every township,
on every street, we're all targets.

539
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:20,428
We'll have taken sides.

540
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:25,891
(sighing)

541
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:28,102
- I think you should make yourself scarce
for a while.

542
00:45:56,882 --> 00:46:21,322
(camera shutter clicking)

543
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:47,765
Hi.

544
00:46:47,933 --> 00:46:51,310
- Came off the telex 10 minutes ago.
It’s a Pulitzer.

545
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:52,478
- You're joking?

546
00:46:52,646 --> 00:46:56,065
- No, I'm not.
- They can't arrest him now.

547
00:46:56,233 --> 00:46:58,567
Too much publicity.
- Well, do you know where he is?

548
00:46:58,735 --> 00:46:59,652
- Yeah.

549
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,570
- So what are you waiting for?
Give him a call.

550
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:08,160
(all): Yeah!

551
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:14,375
- Another one for Greg! Pulitzer boy!
(all): Yeah!

552
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:16,961
Woo!

553
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:23,008
- Yes!
- Go, Kev! Kev, Kev, Kev, Kev!

554
00:47:25,178 --> 00:47:27,179
(tinkling)
- Thank you...

555
00:47:27,347 --> 00:47:29,849
Listen, can I, can I,
can I say a couple of words?

556
00:47:31,268 --> 00:47:32,726
Hello?

557
00:47:32,894 --> 00:47:35,688
I just - I just want to say
a couple of words.

558
00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:37,356
I'm Ronald Graham,

559
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:40,734
and for those of you who don't know,
I'm the editor of The Star.

560
00:47:40,902 --> 00:47:42,987
And I just want to add my...
(applause)

561
00:47:43,155 --> 00:47:47,658
I’d just like to add my voice
to the congratulations for Greg.

562
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:50,453
You know, winning a Pulitzer
is no small thing.

563
00:47:51,621 --> 00:47:54,373
You know we are very,
very proud of Greg.

564
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:55,749
Even though we weren't

565
00:47:55,917 --> 00:47:57,376
the people who published the photos
in the first place.

566
00:47:57,544 --> 00:47:59,086
(crowd booing)
- Big mistake!

567
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:01,464
- Oops! It's our mistake.

568
00:48:01,631 --> 00:48:03,674
- Your mistake.

569
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:06,093
- But I think we're forgiven
because Greg is here tonight.

570
00:48:06,261 --> 00:48:07,845
Actually, you know, Greg,
when you, ah...

571
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:09,638
When you went off to New York
to collect your prize,

572
00:48:09,806 --> 00:48:12,016
a lot of us thought you weren't
gonna come back again,

573
00:48:12,184 --> 00:48:13,893
but here you are.

574
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,687
- I had to come back, Ronnie.
There's no bang bang over there.

575
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:18,564
(cheering)

576
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:21,442
- Congratulations!
It’s well deserved!

577
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:22,818
- Woo!

578
00:48:27,657 --> 00:48:29,408
- So, congratulations, Greg.
That was awesome.

579
00:48:29,576 --> 00:48:31,702
- Oh, thank you.
I appreciate that.

580
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,787
- Ah, fuck, Greg.
Screw your award.

581
00:48:33,955 --> 00:48:36,332
Your fucking photograph,
it's everywhere.

582
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,292
The government is using it to show

583
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,504
how we animals cannot govern ourselves.
How the fuck do you like that?

584
00:48:41,671 --> 00:48:43,714
- Sonny, leave it.
- Even the ANC says

585
00:48:43,882 --> 00:48:47,134
it's a white man's photo
taken for white man's purposes.

586
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:50,179
- Sonny, it's not his fault.
- Is that what you think?

587
00:48:51,515 --> 00:48:55,392
- Let him enjoy his moment, man.
- Sonny, is that what you think?

588
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:58,771
- Forgive him, Greg.

589
00:49:08,657 --> 00:49:11,116
(toilet flushing)

590
00:49:21,294 --> 00:49:22,628
- You okay?

591
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:25,256
- No. No.

592
00:49:27,217 --> 00:49:30,135
Greg, I, I keep having this dream

593
00:49:30,303 --> 00:49:32,596
and in it, I'm dying.

594
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,307
- I think you've had
one pint too many, bru.

595
00:49:35,475 --> 00:49:37,643
- No, it's... I'm getting...

596
00:49:38,895 --> 00:49:40,104
I'm getting crucified

597
00:49:40,272 --> 00:49:42,690
and there's this big fucking lens

598
00:49:42,857 --> 00:49:44,900
that just keeps zooming in on me.

599
00:49:45,068 --> 00:49:46,652
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

600
00:49:47,654 --> 00:49:48,737
-It's just a dream, Kev.

601
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:53,158
- I wake up screaming my head off.

602
00:49:53,326 --> 00:49:54,535
- Kev...

603
00:49:54,703 --> 00:49:56,287
What am I supposed to say?

604
00:49:56,454 --> 00:49:58,330
- I don't know.

605
00:50:02,168 --> 00:50:03,836
- Maybe you need to see a doctor.

606
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:07,256
- Yeah, yeah.

607
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:09,800
- You're just reading into everything, huh?
- Yeah, that's what I do.

608
00:50:10,885 --> 00:50:12,678
- Let's get out of here.

609
00:50:12,846 --> 00:50:14,430
- Sure. Now?
- Yeah.

610
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:18,392
- All right. We're going.
- Cheers.

611
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,227
- Cheers.

612
00:50:20,937 --> 00:50:22,855
- You know,
he didn't know what it was.

613
00:50:23,023 --> 00:50:25,357
I heard they had to tell him
what a Pulitzer was.

614
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:28,110
It’s dumb luck.

615
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:31,113
Ask me, Ken. I'll tell you.
Pure dumb luck.

616
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:35,034
(laughing)
- Yeah, Jimmy.

617
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:38,287
You just have the sheer bloody luck

618
00:50:38,455 --> 00:50:40,372
to find yourself ten feet away
from a burning man.

619
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:44,710
Luckily, you're just two feet away
from an oke with a knife,

620
00:50:44,878 --> 00:50:46,712
taking swipes
at the back of your neck.

621
00:50:48,381 --> 00:50:51,383
I mean, you'd be sure to keep
your eye nailed to your viewfinder, right?

622
00:50:51,551 --> 00:50:54,303
You check your F-stop,
used for a wall of flame.

623
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:55,721
Right?

624
00:50:58,058 --> 00:50:59,725
So when you're that lucky,

625
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,394
come see me.

626
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:08,359
And we can talk about whether
Greg Marinovich deserves a Pulitzer.

627
00:51:09,736 --> 00:51:10,861
- I'm just saying, Ken.

628
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:21,664
(She speaks indistinctly.)

629
00:51:21,831 --> 00:51:23,749
- It was a great night.

630
00:51:24,876 --> 00:51:28,379
I was really surprised
by Ronald's speech.

631
00:51:28,546 --> 00:51:30,756
I really didn't expect him
to do that.

632
00:51:32,425 --> 00:51:34,218
Ah, okay.

633
00:51:47,607 --> 00:51:49,108
Okay.

634
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,360
Greg.

635
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:55,531
Slow down. Slow down.

636
00:51:57,075 --> 00:51:58,492
Greg.

637
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,494
Greg, stop. Greg.

638
00:52:00,662 --> 00:52:02,204
Greg. Stop.

639
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:05,332
Greg, stop it. Stop it!
What's wrong with you?

640
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,459
- Nothing.
(panting)

641
00:52:07,627 --> 00:52:10,713
- Doesn't seem like nothing.

642
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:15,926
- I'm sorry.

643
00:52:17,971 --> 00:52:20,139
It’s all fucked up.

644
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:23,142
I win this prize

645
00:52:23,309 --> 00:52:27,104
and then the ANC publicly accuses me
of being a state spy.

646
00:52:27,272 --> 00:52:30,065
I fucking hate them all.

647
00:52:30,233 --> 00:52:31,608
All of them.

648
00:52:31,776 --> 00:52:34,695
The... Inkatha, the comrades,
this place.

649
00:52:34,863 --> 00:52:36,905
I fucking hate it all!
- Greg.

650
00:52:37,073 --> 00:52:39,324
Greg.

651
00:52:39,492 --> 00:52:42,828
It’s okay.

652
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:48,000
Okay.

653
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:50,085
(soft music)

654
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,798
- Hey.

655
00:52:54,966 --> 00:52:56,175
I'm Kevin.

656
00:52:56,342 --> 00:52:58,552
- I know who you are.

657
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,471
- You do? Shit.

658
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:03,515
My own mother
doesn't even know who I am.

659
00:53:03,683 --> 00:53:05,184
(chuckling)

660
00:53:05,351 --> 00:53:07,352
- Um...

661
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,812
You're one of those photographers

662
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,564
who takes the pictures?

663
00:53:10,732 --> 00:53:12,357
- Yeah, I am.

664
00:53:12,525 --> 00:53:14,234
- I really like your pictures.

665
00:53:14,402 --> 00:53:16,528
- Thank you.

666
00:53:16,696 --> 00:53:18,947
Are you a... are you a journalist?

667
00:53:20,617 --> 00:53:22,075
No, I'm-I'm a teacher.

668
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:24,912
- A teacher?

669
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:30,709
Listen, um, my chinas and me,

670
00:53:30,877 --> 00:53:32,961
we're having a braai on Sunday.

671
00:53:33,129 --> 00:53:35,047
- Okay.

672
00:53:35,215 --> 00:53:36,882
- Would you come?

673
00:53:38,343 --> 00:53:40,177
I mean, your friends

674
00:53:40,345 --> 00:53:43,388
are-are more than welcome
to-to join... It'll...

675
00:53:43,556 --> 00:53:45,766
- I’d love that.
- Yes?

676
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:49,353
- Yes.
- Okay.

677
00:53:56,361 --> 00:53:57,903
- Here.

678
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,656
Let's try this again.

679
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:01,949
(chuckling)

680
00:54:04,744 --> 00:54:06,036
Cheers.

681
00:54:06,204 --> 00:54:08,247
- Cheers.
(glasses tinkling)

682
00:54:16,923 --> 00:54:19,925
- Greg, it's a great picture.

683
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:24,429
- Yeah.

684
00:54:25,932 --> 00:54:27,850
It is.

685
00:54:29,936 --> 00:54:31,436
(sighing)

686
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:34,606
You know, sometimes I think
about doing something else.

687
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:39,111
- I'm not sure I believe you.

688
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:41,530
- I'm not sure I'm telling the truth.

689
00:54:41,698 --> 00:54:43,448
(laughing)

690
00:54:47,787 --> 00:54:49,955
(soft music)

691
00:54:53,793 --> 00:54:56,879
Sometimes I feel so happy

692
00:54:59,632 --> 00:55:02,301
Sometimes I feel so sad

693
00:55:05,096 --> 00:55:07,973
Sometimes I feel so happy

694
00:55:09,726 --> 00:55:12,603
But mostly you just make me mad

695
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,063
- Oh!

696
00:55:15,231 --> 00:55:16,857
(laughter)
Baby you just

697
00:55:17,025 --> 00:55:19,026
Make me mad
- Your man here...

698
00:55:20,862 --> 00:55:23,155
(indistinct mumbling)

699
00:55:23,323 --> 00:55:25,324
Linger on

700
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:31,538
Your pale blue eyes

701
00:55:31,706 --> 00:55:32,915
- No!
- No?

702
00:55:35,001 --> 00:55:37,002
Linger on

703
00:55:39,672 --> 00:55:42,341
Your pale blue eyes

704
00:55:48,514 --> 00:55:49,848
- Ah!

705
00:55:56,898 --> 00:55:59,316
- Fucking butchery this morning.

706
00:55:59,484 --> 00:56:01,610
- I really like this one.

707
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:03,487
- She's not going to last
more than a week anyway.

708
00:56:05,365 --> 00:56:07,282
- Hey, Joao, fuck you.

709
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:10,077
- What the fuck?

710
00:56:10,244 --> 00:56:12,746
Ken, come check this.

711
00:56:12,914 --> 00:56:14,456
- We've just done a layout over here.

712
00:56:14,624 --> 00:56:16,959
It’s a story about you guys.
You're going to love it, it's great.

713
00:56:17,126 --> 00:56:18,585
- There's no way you're printing this.

714
00:56:18,753 --> 00:56:20,128
- What, bru?

715
00:56:20,296 --> 00:56:21,630
- We're not fucking paparazzi.

716
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,175
- Come on, you kind of are.

717
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,386
- Fuck you, man.
It’s like saying we're fucking hyenas.

718
00:56:27,553 --> 00:56:29,096
- No, no, look,
it's a really positive story

719
00:56:29,263 --> 00:56:30,722
about you guys, okay?

720
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:34,017
- Take it out, you fucking wanker,
or I'll take you out.

721
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:36,979
- He's right, bru.

722
00:56:37,146 --> 00:56:39,022
Take it out.
- All right, all right, Joao.

723
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:41,733
What about club?

724
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:44,069
The Bang Bang Club?

725
00:56:44,237 --> 00:56:47,114
- That's so fucking lame.

726
00:56:47,281 --> 00:56:49,658
- No, club's fine.

727
00:56:51,035 --> 00:56:54,329
Leave it in.
Sam, can you please get the plates?

728
00:56:54,497 --> 00:56:56,415
- I'm going to.

729
00:56:57,917 --> 00:57:00,752
Long have we awaited...

730
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,422
- Bye, all. Thanks, Sam.
- Cheers.

731
00:57:06,509 --> 00:57:08,593
Ciao, Viv.

732
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:11,596
- Cheers.

733
00:57:11,764 --> 00:57:13,682
- Excuse me, sir? Hello.

734
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:17,227
I'm Abdul Shareef.
I'm a photographer as well and...

735
00:57:17,395 --> 00:57:20,022
I'm just trying to find out
how do I join this Bang Bang Club.

736
00:57:20,189 --> 00:57:22,357
- Just tell him it's fucking full.

737
00:57:23,443 --> 00:57:25,610
- There's no club, man.

738
00:57:30,283 --> 00:57:32,451
You know the Macho Chicken
just off Old Potch Road?

739
00:57:32,618 --> 00:57:34,202
- Yes sir, I can find it.

740
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:36,580
- Well if you turn up there one morning,
who knows.

741
00:57:36,748 --> 00:57:37,998
- Thank you.

742
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:40,584
Thank you.

743
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:42,085
- You were very nice to that guy.

744
00:57:42,253 --> 00:57:44,379
- Not long ago I was that guy.

745
00:57:47,592 --> 00:57:49,217
(dog barking)

746
00:57:52,346 --> 00:57:53,930
Morning, my chinas.

747
00:57:54,098 --> 00:57:55,849
How's it, bru?
- Morning.

748
00:57:56,017 --> 00:57:58,810
- Hey what's with all the journos?
- Greg. Morning.

749
00:57:58,978 --> 00:58:00,687
- Thanks.
- Ah, them?

750
00:58:00,855 --> 00:58:02,773
Yeah, they've been here every morning
the past week.

751
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:04,107
Waiting.

752
00:58:04,275 --> 00:58:07,986
- Yeah, I've been getting phone calls
about this fucking Bang Bang Club shit.

753
00:58:08,154 --> 00:58:11,615
Some Frenchman called me from Paris.
Wants to know how he can become a member.

754
00:58:11,783 --> 00:58:13,200
- What?
- No shit.

755
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:14,826
- Yeah.
- Hey, bru.

756
00:58:14,994 --> 00:58:17,412
- Hey!
- Who's this?

757
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:19,831
-It's Abdul.
I told him he could ride along.

758
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:23,543
- Greg's been picking up stompies.

759
00:58:23,711 --> 00:58:26,213
Come on.
- Kevin.

760
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:29,341
- Abdul. Nice to meet you.
- Let's go, Kev.

761
00:58:29,509 --> 00:58:32,677
(cars starting)

762
00:58:32,845 --> 00:58:35,013
- What the fuck?

763
00:58:35,181 --> 00:58:37,390
They're following us in.

764
00:58:37,558 --> 00:58:38,934
Come on man, fuck this shit.

765
00:58:41,395 --> 00:58:43,814
- Ah... What's he doin'?

766
00:58:45,024 --> 00:58:46,399
- Hey, assholes!

767
00:58:46,567 --> 00:58:48,068
You make me fucking sick!

768
00:58:48,236 --> 00:58:49,820
Find your own fucking bang bang!

769
00:58:49,987 --> 00:58:51,738
(laughing)
- Sure...

770
00:58:53,116 --> 00:58:54,699
- Hey.

771
00:58:54,867 --> 00:58:57,160
Who else did you tell about this place?
- Nobody.

772
00:58:57,328 --> 00:59:00,038
- Don't fuck with me, man.
- Seriously, nobody.

773
00:59:00,206 --> 00:59:02,707
- How many people did you tell?
-It's not his fault.

774
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:05,210
It’s not his fault, Joao.
They followed us in.

775
00:59:08,047 --> 00:59:10,048
- Ah, okay, man.

776
00:59:31,779 --> 00:59:33,905
(police radio chatter)

777
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:37,033
- Greg. Look down there.

778
00:59:44,584 --> 00:59:45,584
(tires screeching)

779
00:59:45,751 --> 00:59:46,960
(camera shutter clicking)

780
00:59:47,128 --> 00:59:49,671
(police radio chatter)

781
01:00:06,772 --> 01:00:08,356
(local dialect)

782
01:00:08,524 --> 01:00:10,233
- Get down! Get down!
The Zulus are over there, get down!

783
01:00:10,401 --> 01:00:11,902
- What's happening?
- There's no shooting.

784
01:00:12,069 --> 01:00:14,571
- They got a sniper with a silencer.
Get down.

785
01:00:14,739 --> 01:00:16,489
- Get down!

786
01:00:16,657 --> 01:00:18,283
(gunshot)
Ah!

787
01:00:18,451 --> 01:00:19,826
- He's been hit!

788
01:00:19,994 --> 01:00:21,453
- Shit!

789
01:00:22,788 --> 01:00:24,664
- Here! Here, here, here, here!

790
01:00:24,832 --> 01:00:25,874
(gunshot)
- Oh fuck!

791
01:00:26,042 --> 01:00:27,167
Is he dead?
- How the fuck do I know?

792
01:00:27,335 --> 01:00:29,461
- He's breathing. I think he's breathing.

793
01:00:29,629 --> 01:00:31,838
Fuck! I told him he could come.

794
01:00:32,006 --> 01:00:34,633
- He wanted to come, man.
He wanted in.

795
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,885
- Now you see what we go through every day.
- Get him in the car.

796
01:00:37,053 --> 01:00:38,178
- Come on.
(all): One, two, three, go.

797
01:00:38,346 --> 01:00:39,346
- Go, go, go.

798
01:00:39,513 --> 01:00:40,931
(gunfire)

799
01:00:41,098 --> 01:00:42,307
- In the car.
(all): Go, go, go.

800
01:00:42,475 --> 01:00:44,100
- I got the door.

801
01:00:44,268 --> 01:00:45,352
- Watch, watch, watch your head.

802
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:46,770
- Let's go!

803
01:00:48,314 --> 01:00:50,482
(gunfire)

804
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:51,816
(van starting)

805
01:00:51,984 --> 01:00:53,568
Go!
(tires screeching)

806
01:00:54,654 --> 01:00:56,821
(gunfire)

807
01:01:00,284 --> 01:01:01,326
Faster, Joao!

808
01:01:03,579 --> 01:01:04,996
Come on bru, come on!

809
01:01:07,833 --> 01:01:09,834
Stay with us. Come on.

810
01:01:20,888 --> 01:01:23,848
(mournful music)

811
01:02:38,424 --> 01:02:39,716
(camera shutter clicking)

812
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,174
(police siren wailing)

813
01:04:10,766 --> 01:04:13,184
(phone ringing)
(sighing)

814
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:14,686
- Yeah...

815
01:04:14,854 --> 01:04:16,563
Kevin? Yeah, I know...

816
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:19,816
He's what?... Ah, shit.
Okay, I'm on my way.

817
01:04:22,528 --> 01:04:24,529
- Ah, he works for us.
(local dialect)

818
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:29,367
Is that it?
(local dialect)

819
01:04:29,535 --> 01:04:31,369
- We paid your bail.

820
01:04:31,537 --> 01:04:33,705
You okay?

821
01:04:33,873 --> 01:04:35,457
- Kev, what the fuck happened, man?

822
01:04:35,624 --> 01:04:37,000
(sighing)

823
01:04:37,168 --> 01:04:40,044
- I ripped my shirt, man.
Fuck.

824
01:04:40,212 --> 01:04:42,046
- All right, let's go.

825
01:04:42,214 --> 01:04:44,883
- I'll tell you,
but you know how I was supposed

826
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:48,052
to cover that thing with, um,
with Mandela at the hotel?

827
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:49,554
You know?
I was supposed to be there.

828
01:04:49,722 --> 01:04:52,056
But then... but then something
went wrong with my bakkie

829
01:04:52,224 --> 01:04:53,892
and then there's a fucking tree, man,

830
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:55,852
and I fucking went right into it.

831
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:58,771
And then, the fucking cops came
and they found my stash, man.

832
01:04:58,939 --> 01:05:02,525
Ken, I need a favour.

833
01:05:02,693 --> 01:05:04,152
- What?

834
01:05:06,572 --> 01:05:08,990
- I just need one frame of Mandela.

835
01:05:09,158 --> 01:05:11,409
That's it. You know,
you said you were going to cover it.

836
01:05:11,577 --> 01:05:14,162
You said you were going to cover it
for The Star.

837
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:16,581
Right? That's all I need.
I need something to bring in.

838
01:05:16,749 --> 01:05:19,083
- No. No way. Not again, man.

839
01:05:19,251 --> 01:05:20,877
My frames belong to the paper.

840
01:05:21,045 --> 01:05:22,712
- I wasn't there.
- You weren't there?

841
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,422
- No.

842
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:27,091
- I just need one frame.
Something to bring in.

843
01:05:28,427 --> 01:05:30,094
- Fuck you, Kev. No.

844
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:32,347
- Just give him a frame.

845
01:05:34,767 --> 01:05:38,937
- Okay. But you must get your shit together,
you understand me?

846
01:05:39,772 --> 01:05:41,439
- I promise.

847
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,782
- Calm down. Kevin... Kevin!

848
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:52,992
Please.

849
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,119
It wasn't my decision.

850
01:05:56,455 --> 01:05:58,122
Kevin.

851
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:01,042
(sighing)
- You bitch.

852
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:04,629
She fired me and Ken watched it.

853
01:06:04,797 --> 01:06:06,631
You fucker. You watched it.

854
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,634
- Kevin...

855
01:06:14,306 --> 01:06:16,349
It was the drugs.

856
01:06:16,517 --> 01:06:19,310
- Listen, my chinas.

857
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,315
All-all I need is enough money
to cover airfare and hotel.

858
01:06:25,484 --> 01:06:26,818
I have to go to the Sudan with Joao.

859
01:06:37,663 --> 01:06:38,788
- You're not gonna smoke that.

860
01:06:38,956 --> 01:06:40,790
It’s full of cat hair.

861
01:06:40,958 --> 01:06:43,376
- I'm going to get myself sorted.

862
01:06:43,544 --> 01:06:46,087
I need to get my shit together.
Get...

863
01:06:46,255 --> 01:06:48,464
I'm gonna stop.
I'm gonna get sorted.

864
01:06:48,632 --> 01:06:50,466
Did I tell you Allie threw me out?

865
01:06:50,634 --> 01:06:52,719
- Mm-hmm. Aye, you told us.

866
01:06:52,886 --> 01:06:55,513
- And then Joao's only leaving tomorrow,
so there's still time.

867
01:06:58,017 --> 01:06:59,017
- Joao?

868
01:07:00,686 --> 01:07:02,103
- Sure. Why not?

869
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:04,022
(cat meowing)

870
01:07:05,274 --> 01:07:07,358
- That's all I've got.

871
01:07:09,111 --> 01:07:12,363
- Here, Kev. I'll give you more
at the airport.

872
01:07:17,286 --> 01:07:19,287
- Thanks.

873
01:07:26,045 --> 01:07:27,045
- So they've gone?

874
01:07:27,212 --> 01:07:29,005
- This morning, yeah.

875
01:07:29,173 --> 01:07:31,049
- And you gave him money?

876
01:07:31,216 --> 01:07:34,344
- He was really chuffed about it
when we put him on the plane, yeah.

877
01:07:35,846 --> 01:07:38,723
- Maybe it'll do him some good.
(phone ringing)

878
01:07:40,059 --> 01:07:41,100
- Hello...

879
01:07:41,268 --> 01:07:43,394
Yeah, it's Greg...

880
01:07:43,562 --> 01:07:45,897
Yeah...

881
01:07:46,065 --> 01:07:48,566
That's what you saw?...

882
01:07:48,734 --> 01:07:50,818
Okay...

883
01:07:50,986 --> 01:07:52,236
Yeah, great...

884
01:07:52,404 --> 01:07:54,072
Thanks...

885
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,907
Thanks.

886
01:08:02,289 --> 01:08:05,792
- What are you doing?
- An Inkatha attack in Boipatong.

887
01:08:05,959 --> 01:08:07,919
There's armed men
all over the township.

888
01:08:08,087 --> 01:08:10,463
My stringer says some are white
and wearing balaclavas.

889
01:08:10,631 --> 01:08:14,884
Maybe this time I can actually catch
the police doing something.

890
01:08:17,304 --> 01:08:19,013
- No, you can't go in there
on your own.

891
01:08:19,181 --> 01:08:21,474
- You know Ken's in Bop,
covering a boxing match.

892
01:08:21,642 --> 01:08:23,559
It’s important I'm there
and I'm going.

893
01:08:24,561 --> 01:08:25,812
- Jesus, Greg.

894
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:27,814
This is bullshit.

895
01:08:27,981 --> 01:08:29,774
No one goes into Boipatong at night.

896
01:08:32,778 --> 01:08:35,238
(under her breath):
You're behaving just like Kevin.

897
01:08:35,406 --> 01:08:37,740
A fucking junkie.

898
01:08:37,908 --> 01:08:39,117
Fuck.

899
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,746
I'm coming with you.
- Robin...

900
01:08:43,914 --> 01:08:45,748
- If it's safe enough for you...

901
01:09:00,639 --> 01:09:03,141
- Would you light that, Robs?
- Yeah, sure.

902
01:09:50,063 --> 01:09:52,190
(knocking on door)

903
01:10:06,205 --> 01:10:08,331
(local dialect)

904
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:22,762
- Can we have a seat?

905
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:34,398
- Hello, sir.

906
01:10:36,151 --> 01:10:38,110
Thank you for letting us
into your home.

907
01:10:39,738 --> 01:10:41,572
I'm so sorry for your loss.

908
01:10:42,908 --> 01:10:46,244
But it's important that I find out
what happened here.

909
01:10:50,749 --> 01:10:53,584
- They came in buses driven by white men.

910
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,587
And I heard the white men.

911
01:10:58,131 --> 01:11:00,591
They gave them orders:

912
01:11:00,759 --> 01:11:03,594
"Don't talk, just shoot."

913
01:11:07,266 --> 01:11:10,768
I was here at my mother's house

914
01:11:10,936 --> 01:11:12,937
and my son was with me.

915
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:17,608
And I left him with my mother

916
01:11:17,776 --> 01:11:19,944
to go home for my wife.

917
01:11:23,782 --> 01:11:27,952
I began to run
and they ran after me.

918
01:11:29,288 --> 01:11:31,122
And I heard the white men again,

919
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:33,291
"Catch him! Catch him!"

920
01:11:34,626 --> 01:11:36,919
But I ran faster

921
01:11:37,087 --> 01:11:39,630
and hid behind some bushes.

922
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:47,221
And all around me...

923
01:11:47,389 --> 01:11:49,807
I heard them kill people.

924
01:11:50,976 --> 01:11:54,312
Pow! Pow! Pow!

925
01:11:56,315 --> 01:11:59,984
As you would kill insects,
stomping on them with your feet.

926
01:12:06,325 --> 01:12:07,742
When they were gone, I...

927
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,996
I ran to my house...

928
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:16,334
... found my wife.

929
01:12:19,338 --> 01:12:21,923
She was lying out there...

930
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:24,175
in the dirt

931
01:12:24,343 --> 01:12:27,511
and her intestines were hanging out.

932
01:12:30,849 --> 01:12:34,352
She said to me, "Where is Isaac?

933
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,021
Where's our son?"

934
01:12:39,858 --> 01:12:42,693
I said, "He's safe.
He's with my mother."

935
01:12:45,697 --> 01:12:47,698
She said, "Bring him to me."

936
01:12:52,704 --> 01:12:54,372
So I left her.

937
01:12:56,375 --> 01:13:00,044
I came back here to fetch my son.

938
01:13:03,048 --> 01:13:06,717
When I found my son...

939
01:13:06,885 --> 01:13:08,886
he was dead.

940
01:13:14,059 --> 01:13:15,893
They had no mercy.

941
01:13:17,938 --> 01:13:20,064
(crying)

942
01:13:32,911 --> 01:13:34,370
(sighing)

943
01:13:37,582 --> 01:13:39,709
- May I see your son?

944
01:13:41,545 --> 01:13:43,629
- He's in the bedroom.

945
01:14:15,287 --> 01:14:16,787
- Robs!

946
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:20,791
- Sorry.

947
01:14:25,255 --> 01:14:27,423
-It's too dark.

948
01:14:29,968 --> 01:14:31,177
Come on.

949
01:14:45,525 --> 01:14:47,276
It’s in my frame.

950
01:14:52,282 --> 01:14:54,200
(sobbing)
(camera shutter clicking)

951
01:14:54,367 --> 01:14:57,078
You're moving too much. Please.
(sobbing)

952
01:14:58,330 --> 01:15:00,498
(camera shutter clicking)

953
01:15:01,917 --> 01:15:03,876
Can you lean a bit in?

954
01:15:04,044 --> 01:15:06,921
- Just do it. Just do it.
- I'm nearly done.

955
01:15:11,468 --> 01:15:14,553
(camera shutter clicking)
- I can't! I can't! I can't!

956
01:15:14,721 --> 01:15:16,847
(sobbing)

957
01:15:24,523 --> 01:15:26,816
(music)

958
01:15:35,367 --> 01:15:37,785
(chanting)

959
01:16:07,524 --> 01:16:09,984
Maybe you have to be like that
to do what you do.

960
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:13,779
- Be like what?

961
01:16:16,241 --> 01:16:19,201
- I think you have to forget
that those are real people.

962
01:16:20,245 --> 01:16:23,747
- There was nothing I could do
for those people, any of them,

963
01:16:23,915 --> 01:16:25,416
except take a photograph.

964
01:16:25,584 --> 01:16:28,169
Nothing.

965
01:16:31,256 --> 01:16:33,007
What do you want from me, Robin?

966
01:16:35,552 --> 01:16:36,844
- Nothing.

967
01:16:37,012 --> 01:16:40,181
- Okay. Fine. Then why don't you just
leave me the fuck alone?

968
01:16:40,348 --> 01:16:41,265
- Right.

969
01:16:44,936 --> 01:16:47,271
(children talking nearby)

970
01:17:49,834 --> 01:18:38,590
(camera shutter clicking)

971
01:19:05,327 --> 01:19:07,453
- Sorry to hear about you and Robin.

972
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:10,080
- Can't say I blame her.

973
01:19:11,916 --> 01:19:14,251
How was it?
- The whole trip sucked.

974
01:19:14,419 --> 01:19:18,505
Never got near the fucking rebels.
Nothing but flies and skinny people.

975
01:19:18,673 --> 01:19:20,591
(chuckling)

976
01:19:20,759 --> 01:19:22,593
- Well, we might be
back in business here.

977
01:19:22,761 --> 01:19:24,595
After the massacre that night,

978
01:19:24,763 --> 01:19:26,263
I don't know if
this election's gonna happen.

979
01:19:26,431 --> 01:19:29,933
- No shit!
- Well, that's exciting for you guys.

980
01:19:33,021 --> 01:19:35,814
- New York Times called.
They're running a Sudan story.

981
01:19:35,982 --> 01:19:38,025
Have you got anything from your trip?

982
01:19:38,193 --> 01:19:41,445
- I got kak. Nothing.

983
01:19:42,781 --> 01:19:45,783
There might be something
on Kev's roll.

984
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:48,285
He's been raving about a pic
he took just before we left.

985
01:19:48,453 --> 01:19:50,579
- Yeah?

986
01:19:50,747 --> 01:19:52,623
Anything?

987
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:55,292
-It's all shit.

988
01:20:04,636 --> 01:20:05,719
Check this.

989
01:20:15,897 --> 01:20:17,481
- Jesus.

990
01:20:19,734 --> 01:20:21,902
Shit.

991
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:25,989
(mews report): The spectre of starvation
is haunting Africa once again.

992
01:20:26,157 --> 01:20:29,993
In southern Sudan, people caught
in a relentless cycle of civil war...

993
01:20:30,161 --> 01:20:33,831
(woman): The ongoing civil war in the Sudan
was given a spotlight today

994
01:20:33,998 --> 01:20:37,668
when a photograph taken
by South-African photographer Kevin Carter

995
01:20:37,836 --> 01:20:41,422
was published on the front page
of the New York Times.

996
01:20:41,589 --> 01:20:44,633
The picture, which shows a vulture
stalking a little girl,

997
01:20:44,801 --> 01:20:47,511
has caught the attention of the world...
(knocking)

998
01:20:50,181 --> 01:20:52,099
- All right.

999
01:20:53,518 --> 01:20:54,768
- Kev.
- Yeah, hold on...

1000
01:20:54,936 --> 01:20:57,563
- Wake up. Kevin!

1001
01:20:57,730 --> 01:20:59,440
Wake up, buddy. Wake up.

1002
01:20:59,607 --> 01:21:01,525
- Okay, Nancy, here he is.

1003
01:21:01,693 --> 01:21:02,818
- Yo.
- Hey.

1004
01:21:02,986 --> 01:21:04,111
- Kev.

1005
01:21:04,279 --> 01:21:06,822
It’s Nancy Buirski, from the New York Times.

1006
01:21:06,990 --> 01:21:09,700
- Good. Nancy, it's Kevin.

1007
01:21:09,868 --> 01:21:11,493
I need an assignment.

1008
01:21:11,661 --> 01:21:13,495
I need some money.

1009
01:21:13,663 --> 01:21:16,373
- Kevin, your photograph
of the child in Sudan

1010
01:21:16,541 --> 01:21:17,708
just won the Pulitzer Prize.

1011
01:21:17,876 --> 01:21:19,918
- They're going...
they're going to throw me out.

1012
01:21:20,086 --> 01:21:22,629
- Kevin, did you hear what I said?

1013
01:21:22,797 --> 01:21:24,882
You just won the Pulitzer Prize.

1014
01:21:26,801 --> 01:21:27,801
- What?

1015
01:21:27,969 --> 01:21:30,721
- You just won the Pulitzer Prize.

1016
01:21:35,518 --> 01:21:37,644
Can you hear me?
- Fuck.

1017
01:21:37,812 --> 01:21:39,563
Guys.
- Ke. . . Kevin?

1018
01:21:39,731 --> 01:21:42,399
- Nancy. Tell them...

1019
01:21:42,567 --> 01:21:45,402
Tell them what you just told me.

1020
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:47,863
I won a Pulitzer.

1021
01:21:48,031 --> 01:21:49,740
- Kevin?

1022
01:21:49,908 --> 01:21:51,950
- I knew that when...

1023
01:21:52,118 --> 01:21:55,078
when I was taking it,

1024
01:21:55,246 --> 01:21:57,331
there was something special, yeah.

1025
01:21:57,499 --> 01:21:58,916
- Do you have a name for the picture?

1026
01:21:59,083 --> 01:22:01,001
- I don't name my pictures,

1027
01:22:01,169 --> 01:22:03,545
but my friends, they, uh, they named it

1028
01:22:03,713 --> 01:22:05,380
The Budgie Picture.

1029
01:22:05,548 --> 01:22:07,090
(laughter)

1030
01:22:07,258 --> 01:22:08,550
- Kevin, many of our readers

1031
01:22:08,718 --> 01:22:10,469
have asked about the fate of the young girl.

1032
01:22:10,637 --> 01:22:12,429
- The fate?

1033
01:22:12,597 --> 01:22:13,639
- What happened to the little girl, Kevin?

1034
01:22:13,806 --> 01:22:16,767
- I... I don't know exactly...

1035
01:22:16,935 --> 01:22:18,268
She...
- Did you chase the vulture away, Kevin?

1036
01:22:18,436 --> 01:22:20,771
- Yeah, the vulture, yeah...

1037
01:22:20,939 --> 01:22:25,567
After... After I got the, uh, picture...
- But did you physically help her?

1038
01:22:27,111 --> 01:22:28,946
- The girl?
- Yeah.

1039
01:22:30,198 --> 01:22:32,950
- Not physically.
- Kevin, you didn't pick her up?

1040
01:22:33,117 --> 01:22:34,660
- That's not his job.

1041
01:22:34,827 --> 01:22:37,371
- Since when are journalists exempt
from helping people?

1042
01:22:37,539 --> 01:22:40,207
- I'm not saying I'm exempt
from helping people.

1043
01:22:40,375 --> 01:22:44,127
I think my picture did more than that.
- Why not just make sure she was safe?

1044
01:22:44,295 --> 01:22:45,671
- Kevin, no one is saying
you shouldn't have taken the photo.

1045
01:22:45,838 --> 01:22:47,214
- Did you just leave her in the desert
to die, Kevin?

1046
01:22:47,382 --> 01:22:48,715
- And you see no problem
with the choice you made?

1047
01:22:48,883 --> 01:22:51,260
- I don't see a problem with the choice.

1048
01:22:51,427 --> 01:22:55,305
I went there as a photographer.
I took a great photograph.

1049
01:22:55,473 --> 01:22:56,807
- Do you really think you did
the right thing?

1050
01:22:56,975 --> 01:22:59,643
- You could've done something further.
- What about saving this little girl?

1051
01:22:59,811 --> 01:23:02,813
- You don't know what happened?
- But why not just pick up the child?

1052
01:23:02,981 --> 01:23:04,398
- We need to go.

1053
01:23:04,566 --> 01:23:06,108
(intense music)

1054
01:23:14,993 --> 01:23:16,827
- Why didn't you just tell them the truth?

1055
01:23:16,995 --> 01:23:19,037
- I told them the truth.

1056
01:23:19,205 --> 01:23:21,206
- No, you change the story every time.

1057
01:23:21,374 --> 01:23:23,584
- Leave it alone.

1058
01:23:26,254 --> 01:23:28,255
-It's an amazing fucking picture.

1059
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:36,763
Okay.

1060
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,643
- Greg.

1061
01:23:43,855 --> 01:23:45,272
They're right, you know.

1062
01:23:46,065 --> 01:23:46,982
- Who?

1063
01:23:47,150 --> 01:23:49,151
- All of them.

1064
01:23:49,319 --> 01:23:52,362
All of the people that say that it's our job

1065
01:23:52,530 --> 01:23:55,699
to sit there and watch people die.

1066
01:23:57,035 --> 01:23:58,744
They're right.

1067
01:24:02,373 --> 01:24:03,415
- That's not me.

1068
01:24:03,583 --> 01:24:04,916
- Yes, it is.

1069
01:24:05,084 --> 01:24:08,211
-It's in your head, Kev, not mine.

1070
01:24:08,379 --> 01:24:10,047
- I'm not alone.

1071
01:24:15,595 --> 01:24:18,138
(news report): The South African government
and the African National Congress

1072
01:24:18,306 --> 01:24:21,725
have agreed to set a date for South Africa's
first non-racial election.

1073
01:24:23,186 --> 01:24:25,687
Today's announcement did little, however,
to stop the violence

1074
01:24:25,855 --> 01:24:28,982
which continues to threaten
South Africa's townships.

1075
01:24:29,150 --> 01:24:31,443
In an attempt to control the violence,

1076
01:24:31,611 --> 01:24:34,738
the two parties also unveiled
a new peacekeeping force.

1077
01:24:36,407 --> 01:24:38,825
The newly formed
National Peacekeeping Force,

1078
01:24:38,993 --> 01:24:41,244
deployed for the first time
in the townships,

1079
01:24:41,412 --> 01:24:44,373
clearly unable to cope
with the high level of violence.

1080
01:24:45,958 --> 01:24:47,959
They spent most of the day
hiding under their vehicles.

1081
01:24:48,127 --> 01:24:52,047
One man was shot in the leg
by his own comrades.

1082
01:24:54,759 --> 01:24:55,926
- So how was New York, Jim?

1083
01:24:56,094 --> 01:24:58,261
- Yeah, it was good, man. Yeah.
- When did you get in?

1084
01:24:58,429 --> 01:24:59,513
- Yesterday.

1085
01:24:59,681 --> 01:25:03,100
So, what do you guys do
when this is all over?

1086
01:25:03,267 --> 01:25:06,937
- Well, if this war actually ends,
we're really screwed.

1087
01:25:08,106 --> 01:25:11,108
- I can't go back to shooting circumcisions.
- What, not enough blood?

1088
01:25:11,275 --> 01:25:12,984
(laughter)

1089
01:25:13,152 --> 01:25:15,445
No, I'm done with newspapers.

1090
01:25:15,613 --> 01:25:17,197
It’s magazine features for me now.

1091
01:25:17,365 --> 01:25:18,407
- I'm getting an appetizer.

1092
01:25:18,574 --> 01:25:19,700
You guys want a round?

1093
01:25:19,867 --> 01:25:20,617
- Mm.
- Sure.

1094
01:25:20,785 --> 01:25:22,244
Thanks Jim.

1095
01:25:22,412 --> 01:25:23,954
- Times sends him all over the world.

1096
01:25:24,122 --> 01:25:27,249
Northern Ireland, Bosnia. All the shitholes.

1097
01:25:27,417 --> 01:25:28,834
That's what I want to do.

1098
01:25:29,001 --> 01:25:30,460
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1099
01:25:30,628 --> 01:25:32,963
-It's a tough gig, eh?

1100
01:25:33,131 --> 01:25:34,297
Here you go, Joao.

1101
01:25:34,465 --> 01:25:36,299
- Okay.
- Thanks.

1102
01:25:36,467 --> 01:25:39,010
- So I was thinking of going
to this big ANC rally tomorrow.

1103
01:25:39,178 --> 01:25:40,053
How about you guys?

1104
01:25:40,221 --> 01:25:42,806
- Yeah. Their cause has been cooking
for the last couple of days.

1105
01:25:42,974 --> 01:25:45,934
- Okay, well let's do it.
Can I tag along?

1106
01:25:46,102 --> 01:25:48,520
- Of course.
- Jimmy, you don't have to ask.

1107
01:25:48,688 --> 01:25:49,980
- Okay.
- Cheers.

1108
01:25:50,148 --> 01:25:52,149
- Thanks, guys.
- Yeah. Cheers.

1109
01:26:00,324 --> 01:26:01,950
- So Kevin.

1110
01:26:02,118 --> 01:26:05,078
What do you think makes a photograph great?

1111
01:26:05,246 --> 01:26:07,706
- Um...

1112
01:26:07,874 --> 01:26:09,374
- Kevin?

1113
01:26:09,542 --> 01:26:12,669
(clears throat)
- I uh...

1114
01:26:12,837 --> 01:26:15,172
I don't know, really.

1115
01:26:15,339 --> 01:26:17,883
You take the picture
and you see what you have later.

1116
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:22,679
But, uh... But maybe
what makes a great picture

1117
01:26:22,847 --> 01:26:25,682
is one that asks a question, you know?

1118
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:28,810
It’s not just a spectacle,
it's more than that.

1119
01:26:28,978 --> 01:26:30,604
And I think...

1120
01:26:30,772 --> 01:26:34,441
I think mine was like that and Greg's too.

1121
01:26:35,526 --> 01:26:38,278
You go out and you see bad things,

1122
01:26:38,446 --> 01:26:40,572
evil things

1123
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:43,325
and you want to do something about it,
so what you do

1124
01:26:43,493 --> 01:26:45,535
is you take the picture
that shows it.

1125
01:26:45,995 --> 01:26:48,872
- Jeez. Jeez, man.
- Fuck.

1126
01:26:50,208 --> 01:26:52,918
(Kevin): But not everybody is gonna like
what they see.

1127
01:26:53,085 --> 01:26:56,004
You have to understand that they might want
to shoot the messenger.

1128
01:26:57,882 --> 01:27:00,383
- Now I'm sure you're aware
of all the controversy that surrounds

1129
01:27:00,551 --> 01:27:03,053
the photograph of the vulture and the child

1130
01:27:03,221 --> 01:27:07,682
and a lot of people are asking
a lot of questions.

1131
01:27:07,850 --> 01:27:11,561
This may be difficult for you to answer,
but do you know what happened to that child?

1132
01:27:14,816 --> 01:27:15,899
Kevin?

1133
01:27:17,318 --> 01:27:20,278
- What are they running from?
- I don't know.

1134
01:27:20,446 --> 01:27:22,989
(people shouting)

1135
01:27:24,450 --> 01:27:26,409
(gunfire)

1136
01:27:26,577 --> 01:27:28,453
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Fuck!

1137
01:27:28,621 --> 01:27:31,122
- Fuck!
(tires screeching)

1138
01:27:31,290 --> 01:27:32,415
- Shit!
- Fuck!

1139
01:27:36,587 --> 01:27:38,588
- Greg, pass me the phone.

1140
01:27:40,591 --> 01:27:42,175
(gunfire)

1141
01:27:44,262 --> 01:27:45,428
(dialing)

1142
01:27:45,596 --> 01:27:47,514
- Robin, it's Ken...

1143
01:27:48,641 --> 01:27:49,683
Yeah, we're in Thokoza.

1144
01:27:50,518 --> 01:27:53,603
There's lots of guns here.
It’s gonna get fucking hectic down here.

1145
01:27:53,771 --> 01:27:55,272
A bunch of peacekeepers
that don't know what the fuck they're doing.

1146
01:27:55,439 --> 01:27:57,274
Listen, we're going in.

1147
01:27:57,441 --> 01:27:59,192
Make sure they use the fucking pictures.

1148
01:28:00,945 --> 01:28:02,529
- Let's go. Let's go.

1149
01:28:02,697 --> 01:28:05,115
- What the fuck's going on?
- Who cares, it's bang bang.

1150
01:28:18,838 --> 01:28:20,630
(gunfire)

1151
01:28:20,798 --> 01:28:23,216
(screaming, shouting)
(camera shutter clicking)

1152
01:28:29,765 --> 01:28:32,058
(indistinct screaming)

1153
01:28:40,234 --> 01:28:42,736
(camera shutters clicking)

1154
01:28:47,575 --> 01:28:49,326
(gunfire)

1155
01:28:50,661 --> 01:28:53,663
- Fuck, this oke's been shot
across the road there.

1156
01:28:53,831 --> 01:28:55,248
(camera shutters clicking)

1157
01:28:56,417 --> 01:28:59,169
(local dialect)

1158
01:28:59,795 --> 01:29:00,879
(gunfire)

1159
01:29:02,548 --> 01:29:04,674
(camera shutters clicking)

1160
01:29:11,265 --> 01:29:12,766
(gunfire)

1161
01:29:13,517 --> 01:29:15,185
- Shit! Look out, Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken!

1162
01:29:15,353 --> 01:29:17,979
(gunfire)

1163
01:29:18,147 --> 01:29:20,815
(camera shutter clicking)
(gunfire)

1164
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:26,196
- Get the fucking shot.

1165
01:29:26,364 --> 01:29:27,989
- Come on. Take it like a man. You're a puss.

1166
01:29:28,157 --> 01:29:30,033
Fucking pussy.

1167
01:29:30,201 --> 01:29:32,410
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you, man.

1168
01:29:32,578 --> 01:29:34,663
You get the shot.
- Puss.

1169
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:36,122
- Move, move. I'll get it.

1170
01:29:36,290 --> 01:29:37,958
(gunfire)

1171
01:29:41,212 --> 01:29:42,420
(camera shutter clicking)

1172
01:29:42,588 --> 01:29:45,006
Sheesh! Woo!

1173
01:29:45,174 --> 01:29:47,509
- Yeah. Told you.
(gunfire)

1174
01:29:47,677 --> 01:29:49,678
(chuckling)

1175
01:29:52,181 --> 01:29:55,475
(speaking in local dialect)
(whistling)

1176
01:29:55,643 --> 01:29:57,811
(gunfire stopping)

1177
01:30:04,694 --> 01:30:06,277
(camera shutters clicking)

1178
01:30:09,365 --> 01:30:11,074
- What's going on?
- Welcome boys.

1179
01:30:28,843 --> 01:30:29,843
- Who's thirsty?

1180
01:30:30,011 --> 01:30:30,927
- What?
- What?

1181
01:30:31,095 --> 01:30:32,846
- Who wants a Coke?
- What?

1182
01:30:33,014 --> 01:30:34,014
- No, man.

1183
01:30:34,181 --> 01:30:35,640
- No, I'm going to go
to that spot over there.

1184
01:30:35,808 --> 01:30:38,018
- Okay, well if you're gonna go, go.

1185
01:30:38,185 --> 01:30:39,310
- Ready?
- Don't get shot, dude.

1186
01:30:39,478 --> 01:30:40,437
- Oh!
(camera shutters clicking)

1187
01:30:40,604 --> 01:30:42,731
(shouting)
- Idiot.

1188
01:30:43,858 --> 01:30:46,109
- Woo!
- Yeah!

1189
01:30:47,695 --> 01:30:49,112
- Hello!

1190
01:30:51,115 --> 01:30:54,200
Hello, anybody here?! Hello?
(knocking)

1191
01:30:54,368 --> 01:30:56,244
Ah... Two Cokes, my bru.

1192
01:30:56,412 --> 01:30:57,787
- Two...

1193
01:30:57,955 --> 01:30:59,247
Two rand.

1194
01:30:59,415 --> 01:31:00,415
(people shouting)

1195
01:31:05,212 --> 01:31:06,546
- Shit.

1196
01:31:07,923 --> 01:31:09,174
Greg!

1197
01:31:09,341 --> 01:31:10,717
Run!

1198
01:31:12,136 --> 01:31:13,803
(gunfire)

1199
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:19,934
- Ah! Fuck!
- Run!

1200
01:31:21,228 --> 01:31:22,562
(laughter)

1201
01:31:23,147 --> 01:31:24,355
Thanks.

1202
01:31:24,523 --> 01:31:26,066
(laughter, gunfire)

1203
01:31:32,948 --> 01:31:34,532
- We're gonna take out
this nest of snipers, okay?

1204
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:36,743
We're going to move down along this wall.

1205
01:31:38,037 --> 01:31:40,121
As soon as you get around the corner,
you start firing.

1206
01:31:40,289 --> 01:31:41,372
All right?

1207
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:44,000
- I say when they go,
we go with the same wave.

1208
01:31:44,168 --> 01:31:45,168
You got it, Joao?
- Yeah, yeah.

1209
01:31:45,336 --> 01:31:47,545
- Are we gonna fucking do this thing?
(soldiers): Yes.

1210
01:31:47,713 --> 01:31:49,881
- Okay. You guys can come in after us.

1211
01:31:50,049 --> 01:31:52,425
Okay, we're gonna get covering fire
from the Mamba. Bring in the Mamba!

1212
01:31:52,593 --> 01:31:55,136
-It's starting to heat up.
- Alright, get ready! Move down!

1213
01:31:56,847 --> 01:31:58,848
(camera shutters clicking)
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1214
01:31:59,016 --> 01:32:00,934
Get in there, you fucking bastard!

1215
01:32:02,061 --> 01:32:03,728
Go, you piece of shit! Get in there!

1216
01:32:03,896 --> 01:32:05,688
Go! Go! Go!

1217
01:32:05,856 --> 01:32:08,733
Go! Bloody legged! Get off your ass!

1218
01:32:08,901 --> 01:32:10,527
(gunfire)

1219
01:32:11,403 --> 01:32:12,987
- Ugh!

1220
01:32:18,244 --> 01:32:19,369
I'm hit! I'm hit!

1221
01:32:19,537 --> 01:32:21,788
- Hold your fire.
(groaning)

1222
01:32:21,956 --> 01:32:23,957
Hold your fire!
- Cease fire!

1223
01:32:26,127 --> 01:32:28,378
- Get your hands off those weapons!

1224
01:32:28,546 --> 01:32:29,754
- Fuck!

1225
01:32:29,922 --> 01:32:31,339
Shit!

1226
01:32:31,507 --> 01:32:32,924
- We've got another man down.

1227
01:32:33,092 --> 01:32:34,717
- Jesus! Ken's hit! Ken's been hit!
- Hold your fucking fire!

1228
01:32:34,885 --> 01:32:37,303
- Keep still. Keep still.
- Ken's been hit.

1229
01:32:41,225 --> 01:32:43,101
- I'm okay. Help Ken.

1230
01:32:43,269 --> 01:32:46,020
(camera shutter clicking)

1231
01:32:46,188 --> 01:32:47,313
(ominous music)

1232
01:33:04,206 --> 01:33:06,249
(indistinct scream)

1233
01:33:07,585 --> 01:33:09,919
(gunfire)

1234
01:33:30,149 --> 01:33:32,275
(tires screeching)

1235
01:33:43,954 --> 01:33:46,998
- Where? Where?
- In there.

1236
01:33:47,166 --> 01:33:48,166
- Ken!

1237
01:33:48,334 --> 01:33:50,043
Ken!

1238
01:34:21,367 --> 01:34:23,826
- Joao....
- Sam...

1239
01:34:23,994 --> 01:34:24,994
- Is he?

1240
01:34:25,162 --> 01:34:26,955
- Sam...

1241
01:34:27,122 --> 01:34:28,623
Sam...

1242
01:34:40,010 --> 01:34:41,094
Ken's dead.

1243
01:34:50,646 --> 01:34:52,855
(chuckling)
- Hi, Robs.

1244
01:34:53,023 --> 01:34:55,275
- Hello.

1245
01:34:56,694 --> 01:34:57,944
- Where's Ken?

1246
01:35:02,032 --> 01:35:03,116
Is he all right?

1247
01:35:04,702 --> 01:35:05,868
- No.

1248
01:35:10,332 --> 01:35:13,209
(crying)

1249
01:35:15,629 --> 01:35:16,462
(speaks indistinctly)

1250
01:35:16,630 --> 01:35:19,215
(birds chirping)

1251
01:35:22,803 --> 01:35:23,886
(no sound)

1252
01:35:25,723 --> 01:35:27,473
(whispering): I'll be back.

1253
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,414
Hey.

1254
01:35:51,582 --> 01:35:53,416
- Hi.

1255
01:35:57,421 --> 01:35:59,422
I just want them to all leave.

1256
01:36:02,092 --> 01:36:03,426
- Yeah, I know.

1257
01:36:20,903 --> 01:36:23,154
(news report): The explosion of violence
in this township

1258
01:36:23,322 --> 01:36:25,281
is an ominous sign for South Africa

1259
01:36:25,449 --> 01:36:27,283
at the beginning of a week

1260
01:36:27,451 --> 01:36:29,702
of planned protests
and demonstrations by Inkatha.

1261
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:31,704
- I would like to express

1262
01:36:31,872 --> 01:36:35,625
my deepest sympathy

1263
01:36:35,793 --> 01:36:39,962
to the family of Ken Oosterbroek.

1264
01:36:40,130 --> 01:36:42,965
- To Ken Oosterbroek!
(all): Yeah!

1265
01:36:43,133 --> 01:36:45,385
(TV news report continues
in the background)

1266
01:36:58,816 --> 01:36:59,982
- Sorry.
- You fucker.

1267
01:37:00,150 --> 01:37:01,984
- Sorry, man.
- You spilled my fucking drink.

1268
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:04,153
- I said I was sorry, man.

1269
01:37:04,321 --> 01:37:05,405
- Fucking asshole.

1270
01:37:05,572 --> 01:37:07,657
- Watch your mouth, motherfucker.
- Think you can take me on?

1271
01:37:19,837 --> 01:37:24,173
I didn't tell you, but I got an offer
from AP a few days ago.

1272
01:37:26,510 --> 01:37:28,386
They want to send me to Afghanistan.

1273
01:37:28,554 --> 01:37:30,513
I'll be leaving next month.

1274
01:37:34,017 --> 01:37:36,519
It’s what I've always wanted.

1275
01:37:39,523 --> 01:37:40,690
Viv?

1276
01:37:40,858 --> 01:37:42,525
- Mm-hmm?

1277
01:37:43,861 --> 01:37:45,361
- Will you marry me?

1278
01:37:47,865 --> 01:37:49,532
- Yup.

1279
01:37:57,291 --> 01:38:00,209
- Still non-stop jol, is it?
(chuckling)

1280
01:38:02,212 --> 01:38:03,629
How you doing?

1281
01:38:04,965 --> 01:38:08,968
- Better. Really better, yeah.

1282
01:38:14,224 --> 01:38:16,642
I've been thinking about us.

1283
01:38:18,645 --> 01:38:21,606
I think I lost the plot for a while.

1284
01:38:21,773 --> 01:38:23,566
I'm sorry.

1285
01:38:26,570 --> 01:38:30,239
- I think it's an occupational hazard.

1286
01:38:37,581 --> 01:38:39,207
(crowd cheering)

1287
01:38:39,374 --> 01:38:41,918
(news report): And minutes
into Wednesday April the 27 1994,

1288
01:38:42,085 --> 01:38:44,253
the flag of freedom and equality
for all races

1289
01:38:44,421 --> 01:38:46,547
flew over South Africa.

1290
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:54,096
The enthusiasm for voting
among blacks of all ages and conditions

1291
01:38:54,264 --> 01:38:56,766
caught the mainly white organizers
unprepared.

1292
01:38:56,934 --> 01:38:59,602
Millions more ballot papers
had to be produced

1293
01:38:59,770 --> 01:39:02,605
and in six regions,
a fourth day allowed for voting.

1294
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:05,441
Inkatha's late entry into the election

1295
01:39:05,609 --> 01:39:08,277
meant its candidates had to be added
to ballot papers.

1296
01:39:09,613 --> 01:39:10,947
Despite the problems,

1297
01:39:11,114 --> 01:39:14,242
the historic poll is expected
to be declared free and fair.

1298
01:39:52,322 --> 01:39:56,158
- My name is Kevin Carter.

1299
01:39:56,326 --> 01:39:59,495
Without phone, money for rent,

1300
01:39:59,663 --> 01:40:02,456
Money for debts, money...

1301
01:40:04,001 --> 01:40:07,503
I'm haunted by the vivid memories
of killings and corpses

1302
01:40:07,671 --> 01:40:09,630
and anger and pain...

1303
01:40:09,798 --> 01:40:13,009
Of killer executioners. . .

1304
01:40:14,344 --> 01:40:18,347
Of trigger-happy madmen, often police.

1305
01:40:21,685 --> 01:40:26,772
I have gone to join Ken, if I'm that lucky.

1306
01:43:19,446 --> 01:43:21,864
Long have we awaited

1307
01:43:23,867 --> 01:43:26,869
But many times have we seen

1308
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:36,712
In the eyes of the neighbours

1309
01:43:39,216 --> 01:43:41,550
A feeling that leads
Not a guess

1310
01:43:41,718 --> 01:43:43,385
Who's been doing what, who
and went for less

1311
01:43:43,553 --> 01:43:46,055
And who's been left out there
with dust on his dead feet

1312
01:43:46,223 --> 01:43:49,892
Shot down in the city

1313
01:43:54,731 --> 01:43:57,233
Look right at the sunset

1314
01:43:59,569 --> 01:44:02,238
Look left and pour the tea

1315
01:44:04,241 --> 01:44:06,909
Look on in amazement

1316
01:44:08,245 --> 01:44:12,706
Look fast and mass crazy here

1317
01:44:14,918 --> 01:44:17,086
Nowhere else in the world can you see

1318
01:44:17,254 --> 01:44:19,255
so many monsters creep out so efficiently

1319
01:44:19,422 --> 01:44:20,923
and leave you wondering what happened
to all the sacred things

1320
01:44:21,091 --> 01:44:24,927
that got shot down in the city

1321
01:45:04,968 --> 01:45:07,428
New money new money

1322
01:45:09,806 --> 01:45:11,974
And old ways get away

1323
01:45:14,644 --> 01:45:17,229
But here in my cradle

1324
01:45:18,982 --> 01:45:23,986
I lie incapable

1325
01:45:25,655 --> 01:45:27,656
I'm a white boy who looked at his life
gathered his hands

1326
01:45:27,824 --> 01:45:30,159
and saw it was all due
to the sweat of some other man

1327
01:45:30,327 --> 01:45:35,581
That one who got shot
down in the city

1328
01:45:38,001 --> 01:45:40,836
Shot down

1329
01:45:43,006 --> 01:45:46,133
One day we'll fight

1330
01:45:48,011 --> 01:45:53,015
That misty mild day

1331
01:45:54,184 --> 01:46:00,022
And we can live our lives

1332
01:46:01,691 --> 01:46:03,734
In peace

1333
01:46:07,697 --> 01:46:11,033
But don't forget
your brothers and your sisters

1334
01:46:12,702 --> 01:46:16,997
Who got shot down in the street

1335
01:46:17,874 --> 01:46:21,543
Shot down in the street

1336
01:46:36,226 --> 01:46:38,560
Deep in the past

1337
01:46:38,728 --> 01:46:41,730
We can trigger to the barrel blast

1338
01:46:44,401 --> 01:46:47,236
On the avenue

1339
01:46:47,404 --> 01:46:50,447
Where I would crash into you

1340
01:46:52,409 --> 01:46:56,704
What's done is done and life is a gun

1341
01:46:56,871 --> 01:46:59,581
Life is a gun on the run

1342
01:47:01,084 --> 01:47:04,586
Oh my dear isn't life a gun

1343
01:47:04,754 --> 01:47:07,923
A story shotgun that came undone

1344
01:47:08,091 --> 01:47:09,967
It came undone

1345
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:19,935
The well worn path

1346
01:47:20,103 --> 01:47:23,439
Was never something I would walk

1347
01:47:25,233 --> 01:47:28,527
So lay it down

1348
01:47:28,695 --> 01:47:31,655
Lay these guns in the ground

1349
01:47:33,783 --> 01:47:37,953
What's done is done and life is a gun

1350
01:47:38,121 --> 01:47:40,789
Life is a gun on the run

1351
01:47:42,333 --> 01:47:45,961
Oh my dear isn't life a gun

1352
01:47:46,129 --> 01:47:49,465
A story shotgun that came undone

1353
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:51,633
We came undone

1354
01:47:51,801 --> 01:47:54,094
Blu-ray subtitling: CNST, Montreal

1355
01:47:58,767 --> 01:48:00,559
We came undone
