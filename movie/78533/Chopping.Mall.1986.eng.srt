1
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:41,352
Stop right there!

2
00:00:41,419 --> 00:00:44,688
Stop right there and surrender your weapon.

3
00:00:44,756 --> 00:00:47,357
Now you'll see--

4
00:01:17,205 --> 00:01:19,823
[groans]

5
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:39,559
[people chattering]

6
00:01:48,903 --> 00:01:52,972
Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the film portion of our presentation.

7
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,341
I'm sure you all have questions.

8
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,711
So let me introduce you to the head of development

9
00:01:57,778 --> 00:01:59,997
For secure-tronics unlimited--

10
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,949
Dr. Stan Simon.

11
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,837
Thank you very much.

12
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:12,108
Before I open the floor, I'd like you all to meet your brand-new security team--

13
00:02:12,176 --> 00:02:15,278
The protector 101 series robots.

14
00:02:15,346 --> 00:02:17,314
One week from tonight at closing,

15
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:20,217
The protectors will begin their patrol of the mall.

16
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:23,686
Paul, they look like the three stooges.

17
00:02:23,788 --> 00:02:27,741
Each assigned to one of the three upper shopping levels.

18
00:02:27,809 --> 00:02:31,544
I don't know, Mary, the one in the middle has an unpleasantly ethnic quality.

19
00:02:31,612 --> 00:02:33,747
Now, are there any questions?

20
00:02:33,815 --> 00:02:36,049
Yes, Dr. Carrington.

21
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:40,203
So what do your machines there do besides kill criminals?

22
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:42,972
First of all, the protectors do not kill.

23
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,459
I wonder if they kill cockroaches.

24
00:02:45,526 --> 00:02:47,594
They could probably be programmed to.

25
00:02:47,662 --> 00:02:50,463
And merely detain intruders until the computer,

26
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:53,750
Located on the roof, can patch into the mall phone system

27
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:55,401
And send the alarm to the police.

28
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:58,171
I don't know. That guy looked awfully dead to me.

29
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,741
Just neutralized. Protectors can achieve this function

30
00:03:00,808 --> 00:03:02,676
In a number of ways.

31
00:03:02,744 --> 00:03:05,879
At close range, sleep darts fired from here and here

32
00:03:05,914 --> 00:03:08,565
Can knock a man out in less than 30 seconds.

33
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:11,418
However, the likelihood of an intruder gaining entry

34
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:13,753
Is greatly minimized by the steel security doors

35
00:03:13,821 --> 00:03:17,357
Which are time-locked from midnight 'til dawn.

36
00:03:17,425 --> 00:03:19,443
Um, they seem so violent.

37
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:22,812
If they're called protectors, what do they protect?

38
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,882
Plenty. For starters, as seen in the film,

39
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,052
The protectors do their work in the mall proper, not in the stores themselves.

40
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:32,172
Maybe we could use one at the restaurant--

41
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,607
Get rid of people we don't like.

42
00:03:34,675 --> 00:03:36,860
For instance, lasers positioned here

43
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:39,162
Can cut through any sort of debris.

44
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,699
Well, that's all very well and good, but what about those who work late?

45
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:47,437
How can your... Things there distinguish between the good guys and the bad guys?

46
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:49,756
That's very simple.

47
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:53,026
Watch. This is Simon.

48
00:03:54,012 --> 00:03:55,979
Bring number one on-line.

49
00:03:58,182 --> 00:03:59,149
[whirrs]

50
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:01,084
- Whoa!
- Wow!

51
00:04:04,222 --> 00:04:06,923
[murmuring]

52
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:13,179
May I see your identification badge, please?

53
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:16,850
It's scanning.

54
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,620
They remind me of your mother. It's the laser eyes.

55
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:22,489
[robot] Thank you. Have a nice day.

56
00:04:22,556 --> 00:04:24,825
Same to you. There. You see?

57
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:27,093
The system is absolutely foolproof.

58
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:30,146
Now, everyone connected with the mall has been issued an I.D. Badge

59
00:04:30,214 --> 00:04:32,348
So that when the mechanism goes on-line,

60
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:36,786
The protectors will make Park Plaza the safest mall in the state.

61
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:38,388
Trust me.

62
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:41,341
Absolutely nothing can go wrong.

63
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,651
Ow! Are you all right?

64
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:06,452
- Coffee?
- Come on, sweetheart!

65
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,722
Give it to me! What do you got? Andiamo!

66
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,426
Can I get two uncle luigi bellybusters, a double anchovy pizza

67
00:07:13,494 --> 00:07:14,778
And an order of garlic logs?

68
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:18,715
Gross. What mojave brain ordered that? Guy over there.

69
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,967
Oh, god. I should've known.

70
00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:23,636
That orca beaches here every night. Always trying to snag some skin.

71
00:07:23,704 --> 00:07:27,207
Play it safe, Alison. Serve at arm's length, if you get my drift.

72
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:29,042
Thanks for the advice.

73
00:07:29,109 --> 00:07:30,961
Yeah.
[screams]

74
00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:33,063
Shit!

75
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:36,599
Oh, honey, you breakin' my heart.

76
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:39,101
[speaking italian]

77
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:41,438
Look, Alison, in about an hour and a half...

78
00:07:41,505 --> 00:07:44,374
We bail this barbecue and it's good times to the max.

79
00:07:44,442 --> 00:07:46,943
You've got to show. Suzie, you've got a one-track mind.

80
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,945
I already told you, I don't know anybody.

81
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:52,015
- Yeah, but you will after tonight.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

82
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:55,134
Would I set you up with a slime dog or something?

83
00:07:55,202 --> 00:07:57,170
No way, "babe."

84
00:07:57,238 --> 00:07:59,205
[together] it is babe, isn't it?

85
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:02,325
Come on, come on! Take it while it's hot.

86
00:08:02,392 --> 00:08:05,144
- Girls, come on!
- Yeah, all right, all right.

87
00:08:05,212 --> 00:08:06,362
Waitress, more butter.

88
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,898
[loud thunderclap]

89
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:44,750
[alarm blaring]

90
00:08:55,912 --> 00:08:58,181
[alarm stops]

91
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:40,623
[groans]

92
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,217
[man over p.a.] Attention, shoppers.

93
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:53,953
In the next half hour, everything in our drapery department

94
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:57,457
Will be marked down 30 percent.

95
00:09:57,524 --> 00:09:59,825
Your attention, please. Your attention, please.

96
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:05,331
We have a lost child in lingerie answering to the name of Steve.

97
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:08,351
If my uncle finds out I let you do this, I'm dead.

98
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:11,087
Don't tell me, Freddie. Are you going chicken-shit on us again?

99
00:10:11,155 --> 00:10:12,856
We already agreed.

100
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:15,909
He trusts me to take care of the store while he's gone.

101
00:10:15,976 --> 00:10:19,913
He ain't gonna know diddly unless you tell him.

102
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,697
You ain't gonna tell him, are ya?

103
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:23,516
Don't force me to pull rank.

104
00:10:23,684 --> 00:10:25,367
Oh, I'm shaking.

105
00:10:25,435 --> 00:10:28,738
You know, Brennan, you're becoming a real candidate for prickhood.

106
00:10:28,806 --> 00:10:31,574
What? Look, guys,

107
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:34,343
This party is gonna happen, but we need a little teamwork.

108
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:38,781
Besides, if the place looks like shit on Monday, it's all our asses.

109
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,383
You got the beer?

110
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:42,185
Correct.

111
00:10:42,252 --> 00:10:44,621
Come on. dude!

112
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,125
The fridge is packed. Good. Rick and Linda are bringing the food.

113
00:10:49,192 --> 00:10:51,677
Clean sheets are definitely waiting.

114
00:10:51,745 --> 00:10:55,481
And, uh, Suzie--
[chuckles]

115
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:58,902
[chuckles] Suzie has a surprise for you.

116
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,971
[gibbering]

117
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:02,672
I don't know, guys.

118
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,490
Come on, Ferdy.

119
00:11:04,642 --> 00:11:07,927
Forget about your uncle awhile. This is gonna work, okay?

120
00:11:07,995 --> 00:11:11,113
Ferdy, you can't back out on us now.

121
00:11:12,382 --> 00:11:15,384
- Okay, okay, let's party.
- All right.

122
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:17,187
First I gotta find Mrs. Flanagan's fuchsia

123
00:11:17,321 --> 00:11:19,872
You find Mrs. Flanagan's fuchsia.

124
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,992
- You, you hold down the fort.
- I will.

125
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:26,312
- I'm gonna go find Leslie.
- [chuckles] I'm sure you will.

126
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:30,700
Quack, quack.

127
00:11:30,768 --> 00:11:32,935
- Greg, I--
- Ferdy,

128
00:11:33,003 --> 00:11:35,655
Don't worry.

129
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:37,173
I can't find the fuchsia.

130
00:11:37,391 --> 00:11:39,509
Ah, fuck the fuchsia. It's Friday.

131
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:41,628
Tell the old bag to wait.

132
00:11:43,163 --> 00:11:45,314
[loud thunderclap]

133
00:11:47,384 --> 00:11:49,451
Okay. Give it a try.

134
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,721
[engine grinding]

135
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:53,756
Strike three, Walden.

136
00:11:53,824 --> 00:11:55,542
You're out.

137
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:57,343
My turn.

138
00:11:57,411 --> 00:11:59,512
It's okay. I got it, I got it.

139
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,849
You know the rules, buster. Into the cab.

140
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:07,720
Okay, butch. You know I can't resist it when you get tough.

141
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:14,777
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just crank it when I tell ya.

142
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:24,887
- Well? We're waiting.
- Just a sec, huh?

143
00:12:25,956 --> 00:12:27,824
All right. Hit it.

144
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:31,961
[engine starts]

145
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:34,564
Always the first time.

146
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:47,660
I don't want to hear it, not another word.

147
00:12:47,727 --> 00:12:49,679
Me? No way.

148
00:12:49,746 --> 00:12:53,816
I covered this whole deal when I said, "for better or worse," remember?

149
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:55,317
Of course I remember.

150
00:12:55,385 --> 00:12:59,155
Who could forget that 40-weight stain right there on your chest?

151
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,009
Should've been "for better or weird."

152
00:13:05,212 --> 00:13:07,813
And speaking about weird, what about this furniture store--

153
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:10,816
Come on, Walden. Indulge me.

154
00:13:10,884 --> 00:13:14,653
We haven't had any fun since we sunk all our wedding money into the business.

155
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:17,123
Besides, Suzie's counting on us.

156
00:13:17,191 --> 00:13:20,459
- Honey, I don't care about--
- Okay. Okay, okay.

157
00:13:20,527 --> 00:13:22,712
I guess I won't be needing this.

158
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:25,047
Or, um,

159
00:13:25,082 --> 00:13:26,766
Will I?

160
00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:30,803
[tires squealing]

161
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,908
[man over p.a.] attention, shoppers. Attention, shoppers.

162
00:13:35,976 --> 00:13:38,844
Park Plaza will be closed in 20 minutes.

Attention, please. Mr. Brad trevoy to the information kiosk.

00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,259
[gasps] You horny bastard.

167
00:13:53,327 --> 00:13:55,428
[chuckling] Can't you wait?

168
00:13:55,496 --> 00:13:58,331
No. No, I can't.
[chuckles]
[giggles]

169
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,736
What can't you wait for, Michael?

170
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,824
Mr. Todd.

171
00:14:07,891 --> 00:14:10,493
Uh, well, I--

172
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,062
Uh, I was just telling Leslie here that, uh,

173
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,365
Uh,

174
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:18,684
- Well, that, uh--
- Daddy.

175
00:14:18,686 --> 00:14:23,072
He was just telling me how he couldn't wait to take me to Suzie's house tonight

176
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,809
For her, um, birthday party.

177
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,747
I see.

178
00:14:34,518 --> 00:14:36,552
Well, I'm running late.

179
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:38,253
You lock up?

180
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:40,723
Sure, I'll take care of everything.

181
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,242
Yes.

182
00:14:43,244 --> 00:14:44,994
I'm sure you will.

183
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,354
Okay, daddy.

- He said, "go out and have a good time.

186
00:15:05,532 --> 00:15:07,166
All right! That is bitchin'.

187
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:10,686
I wish I had it that easy. My parents still think I'm a kid.

188
00:15:10,754 --> 00:15:13,305
Why do I have the feeling I'm gonna regret this in the morning?

189
00:15:13,373 --> 00:15:16,542
Look, Alison, you've had yourself a very rough first week.

190
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,811
You owe yourself a little blowout.

191
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:21,246
Come on. It'll be fun.

192
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:25,034
Okay, just so long as I don't have to look at any more pizza.

193
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:28,203
You won't. I promise. Oh, great! This is gonna be wonderful.

194
00:15:28,271 --> 00:15:29,972
You won't regret this.

195
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,541
I bet.

196
00:15:31,608 --> 00:15:33,242
[man over p.a.] Attention, shoppers.

- I am so nervous.
- Hairspray, my lovely.

199
00:15:38,431 --> 00:15:40,033
I really hate blind dates.

200
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,802
- Oh, yeah! Audacious! Lipstick.
- Suzie--

201
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,304
Oh, no. This is a terrible color. Give me another color.

202
00:15:45,372 --> 00:15:48,041
- What if he's not my type?
- Oh, yeah, that's it--luscious lust.

203
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:50,509
Are you listening? What are we gonna do all night?

204
00:15:50,577 --> 00:15:53,012
Will you stop worrying? Like I said, he's got--

205
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,014
[together] a great personality! That's right!

206
00:15:55,082 --> 00:15:58,183
He does. You're going to love him. Trust me on this.

207
00:15:58,251 --> 00:16:01,119
- Hey, babe.
- It is "babe," isn't it?

208
00:16:01,187 --> 00:16:03,121
[laughing]

209
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:05,190
- Let me see. Okay.
- What? What, what?

210
00:16:05,258 --> 00:16:07,593
- You look good. Yeah.
- Are you sure?

211
00:16:07,661 --> 00:16:09,695
- Really?
- Yeah!

[loud thunderclap]

213
00:16:16,002 --> 00:16:19,438
Marty, I'm sorry I'm late, but it was all-you-can-eat night down at the pit,

214
00:16:19,506 --> 00:16:22,842
And I couldn't resist the opportunity to pig out.

215
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:25,678
Marty?

216
00:16:25,746 --> 00:16:27,680
Yo, Marty!

Hi, you guys.

218
00:16:35,956 --> 00:16:39,225
The least he could do was clean up.

219
00:16:49,703 --> 00:16:52,238
Waste not, want not. You know what I mean?

220
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:59,679
No, I, uh--I guess you wouldn't.

What do you mean, "who is this"? You called me.

Come on, you guys. Give me a break, I've got a lot of bookkeeping to catch up on already, get away.

250
00:20:00,477 --> 00:20:04,246
Yeah, tonight you are going to shake that ultra-wally image of yours once and for all.

But I like my image. I don't wanna shake it. Look, you guys have fun. I just...

Why, uh, no, officer.

- Well, if that's the way you feel.
- Wait a minute.

00:22:54,968 --> 00:22:56,568
What?

276

I like pepperoni.

? [humming]

- Michael.
- What now?

281
00:23:37,527 --> 00:23:40,462
You know I don't allow that.

282
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:43,832
You allowed it last week, didn't you?

283
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,934
- Huh?
- What are you do-- Michael.

284
00:23:46,002 --> 00:23:49,037
I seem to recall it from last week.
[giggling]

[gasps] Oh!

286
00:24:05,472 --> 00:24:09,141
[laughs] I don't know why I watch these things. I scare so easily.

287
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:13,045
I'm sorry. I should've told you about that. I've seen this a few times.

288
00:24:13,112 --> 00:24:16,515
Can I get you some more wine?

289
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:20,603
Ferdy, are you trying to get me drunk?

290
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,974
No, no. I just figured maybe you might be thirsty.

291
00:24:26,442 --> 00:24:29,678
Part of the reason why Greg fixed me up here tonight

292
00:24:29,746 --> 00:24:33,048
Was so I wouldn't squeal to my uncle.

293
00:24:33,116 --> 00:24:35,383
I never thought that, uh--

294

What?
[sighs]

295
00:24:39,755 --> 00:24:42,724
I never thought it would be so, uh,

296
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:44,893
You know, nice.

297
00:24:46,212 --> 00:24:48,863
It's been nice for me too, Ferdy.

298
00:24:48,931 --> 00:24:52,134
[Leslie] Oh, god! Oh, god!

00:24:59,408 --> 00:25:01,576
Yeah.

302
00:25:01,645 --> 00:25:05,247
It's getting kind of late. I was going to seal up in about an hour.

303
00:25:05,314 --> 00:25:07,449
What do you say I take you home?

304
00:25:08,852 --> 00:25:11,320
That's real sweet, Ferdy,

305
00:25:11,387 --> 00:25:14,122
But if it's all right with you,

306
00:25:15,508 --> 00:25:18,093
We can stay a little while longer.

307
00:25:20,897 --> 00:25:22,464
Nice shot.

Go ahead and laugh, but if I ever find the bastards that did this,

315
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:15,867
- They're dead meat.
- Right, Walter. Right.

316
00:26:15,935 --> 00:26:19,304
Say, you better hustle. You don't wanna get locked up in here again, do you?

Rub it in all you like. I'll be out of here in 10 minutes. You'll see.

00:27:08,254 --> 00:27:10,789
May I see your identification badge, please?

324
00:27:10,857 --> 00:27:12,641
Identification badge?

325
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:15,043
Do not make any sudden moves.

326
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:17,379
Sudden move? I'll give you a sudden move upside the head.

327
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,502
What the hell is that? What is this, you worthless pile of junk, huh?

328
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:28,540
Hey, look, I'm like you, you know?

329
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:31,343
I work here. See? Huh? See that?

330
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:36,181
Ah, shit. I knew you bastards were gonna be trouble when they first brought you here.

331
00:27:36,249 --> 00:27:39,334
[yelling]

332
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:49,177
Thank you. Have a nice day.

333
00:27:56,853 --> 00:27:59,120
[Michael] Hey, smoking's bad for your health.

334
00:27:59,188 --> 00:28:02,424
I have to have a cigarette, and I have to have one now.

335
00:28:02,492 --> 00:28:04,593
Are you for real?

336
00:28:04,661 --> 00:28:07,329
Can't you think of anything you'd rather have besides a smoke?

337
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:09,898
- No.
- Okay. Okay.

338
00:28:09,966 --> 00:28:14,536
Uh, I think Singleton left a pack of Camels under the register.

339
00:28:14,604 --> 00:28:17,006
Camels? No way.

340
00:28:17,073 --> 00:28:20,408
You know I only smoke Virgin Lights.

341
00:28:20,476 --> 00:28:23,646
What do you expect me to do? Go out in the mall and buy a pack?

342
00:28:23,713 --> 00:28:26,815
There's a machine right down by the phones.

343
00:28:34,257 --> 00:28:36,759
You always get your way, don't you?

344
00:28:36,826 --> 00:28:39,828
When I'm happy, everybody's happy.

345
00:28:39,896 --> 00:28:43,848
That's for sure. Hand me my badge, will you?

346
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:46,985
What's the magic word?

347
00:28:48,621 --> 00:28:51,123
Hand me my badge, please.

348
00:28:54,343 --> 00:28:57,046
Thank you.

349
00:28:57,113 --> 00:28:59,864
- Oh, Mike?
- What, what, what, what?

350
00:29:02,202 --> 00:29:03,802
Hurry back.

351
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:08,156
Count on it.

352
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,992
Mmm!

353
00:29:21,571 --> 00:29:23,505
[zipping]

354
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:40,872
[coins jingling]

355
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:47,111
A buck and a quarter?

356
00:30:02,495 --> 00:30:04,463
[door closes]

357
00:30:18,177 --> 00:30:20,111
Leslie.

358
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:26,768
[phone ringing]

359
00:30:26,836 --> 00:30:28,670
Yeah?

360
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,426
No, Jamal, there haven't been any messages for you.

361
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,397
[exhaling]

362
00:30:45,638 --> 00:30:49,207
May I see your identification badge, please?

363
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:51,476
Geez, you little bastards are quiet.

364
00:30:55,298 --> 00:30:59,334
Here.
[indistinct chatter]

365
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,991
Hey.

366
00:31:09,662 --> 00:31:11,863
[door rattling]

367
00:31:17,036 --> 00:31:19,371
No.

[muttering]

369
00:31:38,074 --> 00:31:39,508
Mike?

370
00:31:39,575 --> 00:31:42,844
Mike?

371
00:31:42,912 --> 00:31:44,612
Brennan, you ass.

372
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,250
I'm not in the mood for games.

373
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:51,269
[angry muttering on tv]

374
00:31:51,337 --> 00:31:53,304
What is it with those two anyway?

375
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:56,641
Personally, I can't figure it out. All they do is have sex and fight.

376
00:31:56,709 --> 00:31:58,743
- Like most couples.
- Yeah.

377
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:02,514
Look, we've got about 15 minutes before the whole place locks up.

378
00:32:02,582 --> 00:32:04,516
- Ferdy.
- Yeah?

379
00:32:08,187 --> 00:32:09,821
Thanks.

380
00:32:21,968 --> 00:32:23,151
Mike?

381
00:32:24,887 --> 00:32:26,588
Mike?

382
00:32:26,656 --> 00:32:27,923
Mike?

383
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,175
Damn you!

384
00:32:39,202 --> 00:32:42,871
Brennan, 'you don't come out now, don't bother.

385
00:32:44,507 --> 00:32:46,074
All right, wake up.

386
00:32:46,142 --> 00:32:48,143
Wake up!

387
00:32:48,211 --> 00:32:49,961
I said wake up!

388
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:51,830
That's it! I don't need this crap!

389

Thank you. Have a nice day.

401
00:33:47,453 --> 00:33:51,590
Protector 1, arming. Engage intruder.

402
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,794
Oh, my god, there's another one!

403
00:33:55,862 --> 00:33:58,864
Protector 2, arming. Assist protector 1.

404
00:33:58,931 --> 00:34:00,632
The storeroom, quick, let's go.

405
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,218
Let's go!

00:34:17,767 --> 00:34:20,434

00:35:10,353 --> 00:35:12,654
- Here's a box.
- Good. All right.

413
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:18,060
[Greg] This isn't gonna hold them very long.

414
00:35:18,127 --> 00:35:21,729
- You got any better ideas?
- What about the fire exit?

415
00:35:21,797 --> 00:35:23,932
[Greg] All that's gonna do is put us back in the middle of those machines.

416
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:26,417
Beats being trapped in here. Who knows what they're planning right now?

417
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:31,706
Linda's right. We've gotta get out somewhere we can run and get some weapons.

418
00:35:34,626 --> 00:35:36,895
[mechanical doors slamming shut]

419
00:35:45,421 --> 00:35:47,238
What was that?

420
00:35:47,306 --> 00:35:50,325
That's the sound of us being locked in here all night.

421
00:35:50,393 --> 00:35:52,811
The security doors don't open 'til 6:00.

422
00:35:52,878 --> 00:35:55,580
Oh, no! We're never gonna get out of here!

423
00:35:55,648 --> 00:35:59,184
- Yes, we are.
- The phone's dead.

424
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:01,952
The computer must have taken control.
[whimpering]

425
00:36:03,355 --> 00:36:04,722
Hey, what about that?

426
00:36:05,774 --> 00:36:07,609
The air duct.

427
00:36:07,676 --> 00:36:09,778
Wait, we take it down to the parking levels, we're outta here.

428
00:36:09,846 --> 00:36:11,145
Let's go for it!

00:36:11,697 --> 00:36:13,264
[whimpering]

00:36:13,332 --> 00:36:14,900

- Go, Suzie. Go.

434
00:36:32,552 --> 00:36:35,102
- I'm right behind you.
- As usual.

435
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,789
Prepare for termination.

436
00:36:37,856 --> 00:36:39,791
Proceeding to alternate access.

437
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:41,626
Come on, Alison, you're next.

438
00:36:45,798 --> 00:36:48,099
Come on, keep going. Keep going!

[yelling and screaming]

440
00:37:09,956 --> 00:37:13,191
I thought this was an air conditioning duct.

441
00:37:13,259 --> 00:37:16,761
- Except the heat's been turned on.
- In the middle of summer?

442
00:37:16,763 --> 00:37:20,582
They know we're in here. They're trying to french-fry us.

443
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,483
Come on, Suze.

444
00:37:22,552 --> 00:37:25,921
You know who gives you twice as much heat at the restaurant.

Wrap whatever you can around your hands.

[whimpering]

450
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:44,305
I can't stand this anymore.

451
00:37:44,373 --> 00:37:46,407
I gotta get outta here.

452
00:37:47,743 --> 00:37:49,677
I gotta get outta here!
[sobbing]

453
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:52,313
Come on, Suze.

454
00:37:52,381 --> 00:37:54,215
Hang in there.

455
00:37:54,283 --> 00:37:56,517
[sobbing continues]

456
00:38:02,808 --> 00:38:04,809
- What now?
- Find some way outta here.

457
00:38:04,877 --> 00:38:07,545
- We're gonna have to defend ourselves.
- This place got a sporting goods store?

458
00:38:07,613 --> 00:38:10,081
[together] Peckinpah's. Let's go. Come on.

459
00:38:10,149 --> 00:38:12,383
- How are we gonna get in?
- Don't worry. I got the keys.

460
00:38:16,105 --> 00:38:17,489
Shit.

461
00:38:22,327 --> 00:38:25,096
- Ferdy, propane tanks. Grab the biggest.
- All right.

462
00:38:25,164 --> 00:38:27,932
Let's see.

463
00:38:31,537 --> 00:38:34,272
- What about shells?
- Twelve gauge.

464
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:37,908
- Here.
- Great. Thanks.

465
00:38:37,976 --> 00:38:40,812
And some 223's.

466
00:38:49,471 --> 00:38:52,273
Let's go send those fuckers a rambo-gram.

467
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,489
You sure you know how to shoot that?

468
00:39:07,556 --> 00:39:10,592
Yeah. I saw dirty harry 24 times.

469
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:14,762
- All set?
- Yeah.

470
00:39:18,501 --> 00:39:20,168
Good.

471
00:39:22,438 --> 00:39:25,973
- One of them ought to have heard that.
- Dead man could've heard that.

472
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:31,362
Hey, fellas, we got company.

473
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:34,699
That didn't take very long.

474
00:39:34,766 --> 00:39:37,318
Steady. Go for it.

475
00:40:02,644 --> 00:40:04,728
Ferdy, now!

476
00:40:15,957 --> 00:40:18,342
[whimpering] I gotta find Greg.

477
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,778
He needs me.

478
00:40:20,846 --> 00:40:23,881
- Let me outta here!
- Suzie, please.

479
00:40:23,949 --> 00:40:27,985
The guys told us to go down to the parking levels.

480
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,551
[whirring]

481
00:40:54,996 --> 00:40:58,116
Come on, kiddo. Greg wouldn't want you to give up now.

482
00:40:58,184 --> 00:41:00,151
Oh, go to hell, Linda!

483
00:41:00,219 --> 00:41:03,671
You do what you want, but I'm getting out of here.

484
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:06,875
Suzie, stop it! Please.

485
00:41:06,942 --> 00:41:10,177
Greg needs me. I know he does.

486

00:41:22,474 --> 00:41:24,375
Jesus.

488
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:27,778
- What's that?
- Robot blood.

489
00:41:29,515 --> 00:41:32,183
- Not too shabby, huh?
-  Yeah, we're not finished yet.

490
00:41:32,251 --> 00:41:34,752
We still got two more of these suckers around here someplace.

491
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,588
We gotta get more tanks.

492
00:41:36,655 --> 00:41:38,590
- What are you thinking?
- I got an idea.

493
00:41:40,226 --> 00:41:44,128
- Really, this is not a good idea.
- Bullshit!

494
00:41:44,196 --> 00:41:47,365
Greg could be hurt. They all could.

495
00:41:47,433 --> 00:41:49,967
I'm gonna find them.

496
00:41:50,035 --> 00:41:51,819
I've got to.

497
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:54,054
What do you think?

498
00:41:54,122 --> 00:41:55,990
Well,

499
00:41:56,057 --> 00:42:00,695
If we gotta go, let's not go empty-handed.

500
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:06,133
[loud whirring]

501
00:42:42,755 --> 00:42:45,356
Shit. I didn't think they'd work.

502
00:42:45,424 --> 00:42:47,091
Never hurts to try.

503
00:42:47,293 --> 00:42:51,078
- No, I guess not.
- Give me a hand. Let's pry this baby open.

504
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:54,982
- Come on.
- You know, I gotta worry.

505
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,534
Report from the front: Ferdy's gotta worry.

506
00:42:57,603 --> 00:43:00,254
Yeah. What if these things can read our minds?

507
00:43:00,321 --> 00:43:03,407
They're gonna be awful mad when they get to me.

508
00:43:03,475 --> 00:43:05,693
- All right.
- Come on. Let's go.

509
00:43:05,761 --> 00:43:07,862
Give me the gun.

510
00:43:10,499 --> 00:43:13,801
Take the cap off and stuff the cloth in.

511
00:43:13,803 --> 00:43:16,420
- That's it?
- That's it. Light it and throw it.

512
00:43:16,622 --> 00:43:18,990
You sound like you've done this before.

513
00:43:19,057 --> 00:43:21,859
Regular or unleaded, it gets the job done.

[whirring]

515
00:43:57,729 --> 00:44:00,564
Protector 1 back on-line.

516
00:44:04,536 --> 00:44:06,721
Hey, guys, how's it goin'?

517
00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:09,356
Almost done, Ferdy.

518
00:44:09,424 --> 00:44:12,293
- You think Mike got out all right?
- For his sake, I hope so.

519
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:16,230
- Right now, I'm more concerned about the girls.
- Yeah ,you and me both.

520
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:22,052
Hey, I almost forgot. How much do I owe you for the beer?

521
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,456
Forget it, man. If we get out of here, you owe me a six-pack.

522
00:44:25,523 --> 00:44:28,459
Just make sure that those cords are good and tight.

523
00:44:28,526 --> 00:44:30,627
Are you sure this is gonna work?

524
00:44:30,695 --> 00:44:33,064
With those things, I'm not sure of anything.

525
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:35,182
Ferdy, how's the panel coming?

526
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,268
The doors work. I bypassed the circuit.

527
00:44:37,336 --> 00:44:40,204
But forget about going up or down. It's controlled by the computer.

528
00:44:40,272 --> 00:44:43,907
- Do you hear anything unusual?
- Only my heart beat.

No!

- Come on!

We've gotta help her!

00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,090
Thank you, and have a nice day.

You fucking bastard.

547
00:46:36,905 --> 00:46:38,923
Get 'em to safety!

548
00:46:41,827 --> 00:46:43,761
It's no use!

549
00:47:16,878 --> 00:47:18,913
Go! Take it!

550
00:48:02,907 --> 00:48:05,443
Now! Rick!

551
00:48:38,243 --> 00:48:40,177
Nice shot.

552
00:48:40,245 --> 00:48:42,346
Dad's a marine.

553
00:49:13,095 --> 00:49:15,379
According to my calculations--

554
00:49:15,397 --> 00:49:19,583
Provided we survive the night, of course--

555
00:49:19,651 --> 00:49:23,153
We're gonna be in hock to this place for the next 85 years.

556
00:49:26,724 --> 00:49:29,793
How many tune-ups is that?

557
00:49:29,861 --> 00:49:32,530
Just a sec.

558
00:49:33,898 --> 00:49:38,118
2,900,431.

559
00:49:40,121 --> 00:49:42,456
Maybe we should raise our rates.

- Hey, dead-eye.
- Yo.

Thanks.

00:49:59,825 --> 00:50:02,026
Tell me one thing, though, huh?

564
00:50:03,428 --> 00:50:07,581
Why did you leave the air shaft?

565
00:50:07,733 --> 00:50:10,618
I mean, you were safe there.

566
00:50:14,372 --> 00:50:15,839
You were safe.

567
00:50:15,907 --> 00:50:19,260
Suzie thought you were in trouble. She just wanted to help.

568
00:50:19,328 --> 00:50:21,712
I'm telling you you should've kept her there.

569
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,097
She told you what happened. Why don't you just leave her alone?

570
00:50:24,165 --> 00:50:26,900
Shut up.

571
00:50:26,968 --> 00:50:29,920
You just shut the fuck up!

Hey. Do you guys mind keeping it down?

573
00:50:34,325 --> 00:50:37,011
There's another one of those things out there,

574
00:50:37,078 --> 00:50:39,430
And you're gonna bring it right to us.

575
00:50:39,497 --> 00:50:41,065
There's another one?

576
00:50:41,133 --> 00:50:43,351
Why haven't we seen it? Why?

577
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:46,437
I'll tell you why.

578
00:50:46,504 --> 00:50:49,123
'cause the fucker's out there waiting for us.

579
00:50:49,274 --> 00:50:51,942
He's waiting to pick us off one by one!

580
00:50:52,009 --> 00:50:54,528
But I got news for you.

581
00:50:54,595 --> 00:50:56,663
He ain't getting me.

582
00:50:56,731 --> 00:50:59,583
Greg, you're not thinking, man.

583
00:50:59,651 --> 00:51:02,519
We got destroyed by staying together.

584
00:51:02,587 --> 00:51:05,555
And a lot of good that did Suzie, right?

585
00:51:11,112 --> 00:51:14,865
Wait. I got an idea.

586
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:20,070
The master computer is somewhere on the third level.

587
00:51:20,188 --> 00:51:23,957
We shut it down, it shuts the robots down.

588
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:32,199
Well?
[panting]

589
00:51:32,267 --> 00:51:34,167
It's worth a try.

00:51:41,209 --> 00:51:44,011

- Wait! Slow down!

594
00:51:55,306 --> 00:51:57,808
Man, he's losin' it! We're lucky he doesn't get us all killed.

595
00:51:57,876 --> 00:52:00,778
Greg, stop! Greg, wait!

596
00:52:02,647 --> 00:52:05,399
Greg, please! Stop!

- Alison, are you all right?
- I think so.

00:53:37,091 --> 00:53:39,026
- Where to?
-  Escalator, third level.

613
00:53:39,093 --> 00:53:41,762
What about the doors? We can't lock them. They'll get through.

614
00:53:41,829 --> 00:53:44,398
Maybe so.

- We've gotta get outta here.

00:57:08,703 --> 00:57:12,839
Not so fast. One of them could've doubled back. We could get picked off out there.

Look, if those things want some target practice,

642

Let's go find that computer.

00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:20,617
- Where the hell is it?
- Probably up one of these service corridors.

655
00:59:20,684 --> 00:59:24,121
There's a million doors. We'll never find it.

656
00:59:24,188 --> 00:59:27,523
Okay, you try over there, and I'll try over here.

657
00:59:27,591 --> 00:59:29,860
- I don't want to split up.
- What can happen?

658
00:59:29,927 --> 00:59:31,862
- You want a list?
- We're wasting time.

659
00:59:31,929 --> 00:59:35,365
- Look, if you see anything or hear anything--
- You'll hear me.

660
00:59:35,432 --> 00:59:37,200
Okay.

01:02:43,787 --> 01:02:45,888
Alison, move! Get out!

674
01:02:48,742 --> 01:02:52,045
Laser malfunction. Laser malfunction. Engage intruder.

675

Engage intruder! Laser malfunction! Laser malfunction!

676
