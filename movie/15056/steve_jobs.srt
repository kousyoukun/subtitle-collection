00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:28,677
有了這樣的電影<I> 2001 </i>你
突出我們進入了21世紀。
And with that movie <i>2001,</i> you're
projecting us into the 21st century.

7
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:30,679
- 我帶了我的兒子喬納森
- 你好。
- I brought along my son Jonathan...
- Hi.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,417
誰在2001年會
相同的年齡就像我現在一樣。
Who in the year 2001 will
be the same age as I am now.

9
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:39,521
也許他會得到更好的調整，以本
什麼樣的世界，你試圖描繪的。
Maybe he will be better adjusted to this
kind of world that you're trying to portray.

10
00:00:39,522 --> 00:00:41,490
最大的區別，當他長大......
The big difference, when he grows up...

11
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:43,660
事實上，如果我們想
等到2001年...
In fact, if we wanted to
wait till the year 2001...

12
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:46,762
他將在自己的房子
He will have in his own house

13
00:00:46,763 --> 00:00:49,966
沒有一台電腦一樣大
此，但至少一個控制台
not a computer as big as
this, but at least a console

14
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,670
通過他可以跟
他友好的本地計算機
through which he can talk to
his friendly local computer

15
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:55,972
並得到所有的信息
他需要為自己的日常生活，
and get all the information
he needs for his everyday life,

16
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:59,508
喜歡他的銀行對賬單，
他的劇院的保留，
like his bank statements,
his theater reservations,

17
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:04,948
所有你需要在使用過程中的信息
生活在一個複雜的現代社會。
all the information you need in the course
of living in a complex modern society.

18
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:09,052
這將是在一個緊湊的
形成自己的房子。
This will be in a compact
form in his own house.

19
00:01:09,053 --> 00:01:12,421
他將有一個電視屏幕，
像這些這裏，和一個鍵盤。
He'll have a television screen,
like these here, and a keyboard.

20
00:01:12,422 --> 00:01:14,790
他會跟電腦
和從它得到的信息。
And he'll talk to the computer
and get information from it.

21
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:17,560
他將採取盡可能多的
授予我們採取了電話。
And he'll take it as much for
granted as we take the telephone.

22
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:20,829
我不知道，不過，什麼樣的
生活會是想在社會方面？
I wonder, though, what sort of a
life would it be like in social terms?

23
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,566
我的意思是，如果我們的整個生活
是圍繞計算機，
I mean, if our whole life
is built around the computer,

24
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:25,668
我們成為了計算機依賴的社會現象？
do we become a computer-dependent society?

25
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,704
在某些方面，但他們
也將豐富我們的社會
In some ways, but they
will also enrich our society

26
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:32,508
因為這將有可能使
我們的生活，真的，任何地方，我們喜歡。
because it will make it possible for
us to live, really, anywhere we like.

27
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:37,346
任何商人和行政
能夠生活在地球上幾乎任何地方
Any businessman and executive
could live almost anywhere on Earth

28
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,948
仍然做他的生意
通過這樣的設備。
and still do his business
through a device like this.

29
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:43,552
這是一個美妙的事情。 它的意思是
我們不會被卡在城市。
And this is a wonderful thing. It means
we won't have to be stuck in cities.

30
00:01:43,553 --> 00:01:47,357
我們將能夠活出在
國家或地方，我們請。
We'll be able to live out in the
country or wherever we please.

31
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:53,930
<I>屏幕說，這是一個
未實現的陷阱。</i>
<i>Screen says it's an
unimplemented trap.</i>

32
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:56,533
<I>但是，錯誤代碼是
錯誤。 這是一個系統錯誤。</i>
<i>But the error code is
wrong. It's a system error.</i>

33
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,734
<I>  - 那麼，有什麼結果？
- 這不是要去打招呼</i>
<i>- So what's the upshot?
- It's not gonna say hello.</i>

34
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:00,170
<I>這絕對是要去打招呼。</i>
<i>It absolutely is gonna say hello.</i>

35
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:02,638
<I>  - 這是誰的錯。 這是一個系統錯誤。
- 你建的聲音演示</i>。
<i>- It's nobody's fault. It's a system error.
- You built the voice demo.</i>

36
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:04,674
- 語音演示是片狀的。
- 讓你的聲音了。
- The voice demo is flaky.
- Keep your voices down.

37
00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:06,742
我一直在告訴你，
為......這件事是過度開發。
I've been telling you that
for... This thing is overbuilt.

38
00:02:06,743 --> 00:02:09,011
它的工作昨晚。 它
在此之前，工作了一夜。
It worked last night. It
worked the night before that.

39
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:10,347
它的工作在三個小時以前。
It worked three hours ago.

40
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,483
- 這不是現在的工作，所以只跳過的聲音演示。
- 你他媽的。
- It's not working now, so just skip over the voice demo.
- Fuck you.

41
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:14,818
- 其他一切工作正常。
- 噓。
- Everything else is working.
- Shh.

42
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,519
跳過的聲音演示。
Skip over the voice demo.

43
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,021
我們需要它來打個招呼。
We need it to say hello.

44
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:21,623
- 你不聽我的。 它不會打招呼。
- 只需修復它。
- You're not hearing me. It's not going to say hello.
- Just fix it.

45
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:22,925
- 修好它？
- 是啊。
- Fix it?
- Yeah.

46
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:26,763
- 在40分鐘內？
- 修好它。
- In 40 minutes?
- Fix it.

47
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:28,630
- 我不能。
- 誰是人誰可以？
- I can't.
- Who's the person who can?

48
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:31,335
我是誰的人就可以了，我不能。
I'm the person who can, and I can't.

49
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,636
- 多麼糟糕，你在說什麼？
- 這是非常糟糕的。
- How bad are you saying?
- It's pretty bad.

50
00:02:34,637 --> 00:02:38,441
- 我不知道這意味著什麼。
- 這意味著演示更可能會崩潰。
- I don't know what that means.
- It means the demo is more than likely gonna crash.

51
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:39,842
你必須保持你的聲音了。
You have to keep your voices down.

52
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:41,878
喬爾Pforzheimer是
坐在出在房子裏。
Joel Pforzheimer is
sitting out in the house.

53
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,447
我不在乎......誰是喬爾Pforzheimer？
I don't care if... Who's Joel Pforzheimer?

54
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:45,914
<I> GQ。</i>
<i>GQ.</i>

55
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,617
他被遮蔽你
一個星期。 你注意到了嗎？
He's been shadowing you
for a week. Did you notice?

56
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:50,486
只是看起來像一切都很好。
Just look like everything's fine.

57
00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:52,889
他坐了在家裏。
He's sitting out in the house.

58
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,425
嘿。
Hey.

59
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:58,128
什麼是你們在說什麼？
What are you guys saying?

60
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:01,698
有些種類的競爭狀態，但我們
一直無法追蹤下來呢。
Some kind of race condition, but we
haven't been able to track it down yet.

61
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,165
是合成器採樣速度不夠快？
Is the synthesizer sampling fast enough?

62
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,901
沒有，使該利率已關閉
它總是死機。
No, so the rates are off
and it keeps crashing.

63
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:08,872
它的20個秒兩小時
發射。 為什麼不只是削減呢？
It's 20 seconds out of a two-hour
launch. Why not just cut it?

64
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:10,507
- 我們不能剪。
- 是啊，你只是削減它。
- We can't cut it.
- Yeah, you just cut it.

65
00:03:10,508 --> 00:03:14,510
前兩天，我們跑了超級碗廣告的
可能已經獲得了奧斯卡最佳短片。
Two days ago, we ran a Super Bowl ad that
could've won the Oscar for Best Short Film.

66
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:17,880
還有更多的人誰可以告訴你
廣告不是可以告訴你誰贏得了比賽。
There are more people who can tell you about
the ad than can tell you who won the game.

67
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:20,749
我明白了，但廣告說：
在Mac是要去拯救世界。
I understand, but the ad said
the Mac was gonna save the world.

68
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,885
它並沒有說這是會打個招呼。
It didn't say it was gonna say hello.

69
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:24,687
我們在五個開放的房子。
We open the house in five.

70
00:03:24,688 --> 00:03:27,157
不要打開房子。
Don't open the house.

71
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:28,724
我們正在做一項快速突破。
We're taking a quick break.

72
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:30,259
- 這個問題的部分原因是...
- 什麼？
- Part of the problem is...
- What?

73
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,431
我們可以重新編譯，但如果它是一個硬體
的問題，我們不能進入了。
We can recompile, but if it's a hardware
problem, we can't get into the back.

74
00:03:34,432 --> 00:03:35,998
為什麼不呢？
Why not?

75
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:38,835
- 你要告訴她還是要我？
- 不要跟我做起，人。
- Do you wanna tell her or should I?
- Don't start with me, man.

76
00:03:38,836 --> 00:03:41,204
- 為什麼他不能進入機器？
- 你需要特殊的工具。
- Why can't he get into the machine?
- You need special tools.

77
00:03:41,205 --> 00:03:43,806
什麼樣的特殊的工具？
就拿螺絲刀。
What kind of special tools?
Just take a screwdriver.

78
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,842
他不想讓用戶能夠打開它。
He didn't want users to be able to open it.

79
00:03:45,843 --> 00:03:48,812
你需要特殊的工具。
You need special tools.

80
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:50,347
這是真的嗎？
Is this for real?

81
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:53,483
有一百個工程師走
這周圍。 他們沒有一個有工具？
There are a hundred engineers walking
around here. None of them have the tools?

82
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,985
憑心而論，沒有太多的
他們發出的工具。
In fairness, not many of
them were issued the tools.

83
00:03:55,986 --> 00:04:00,156
- 那你呢？
- 我離開他們的辦公室。 這是上午3:00，當我...
- What about you?
- I left them at the office. It was 3:00 AM when I...

84
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,758
哦，耶穌基督。
Oh, Jesus Christ.

85
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,826
- 切「你好。」
- 沒有。
- Cut "Hello."
- No.

86
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,028
- 什麼是一個推出的第一條規則？
- 這是不是會崩潰。
- What's the first rule of a launch?
- It's not gonna crash.

87
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:07,597
它只是做了。
It just did.

88
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:08,664
安迪！
Andy!

89
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,532
哪一個？
Which one?

90
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:12,701
其他安迪。 你是對的
那裏。 我為什麼要呼喚？
The other Andy. You're right
there. Why would I be calling out?

91
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:14,069
- 他需要和你談談。
- 是啊。
- He needs to talk to you.
- Yeah.

92
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,240
出口標誌必須關閉或
我們不會得到一個完整的停電。
The exit signs need to be off or
we're not gonna get a full blackout.

93
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:20,009
- 我們已經談過，樓宇管理及消防元帥。
- 和？
- We've spoken to the building manager and the fire marshal.
- And?

94
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,077
有沒有辦法，他們會
讓我們把出口標誌了。
There's no way they're gonna
let us turn the exit signs off.

95
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:24,247
我會付一切的罰款。
I'll pay whatever the fine is.

96
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:26,615
罰款是他們會來
並告訴大家離開。
The fine is they're gonna come
in and tell everyone to leave.

97
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:28,884
你解釋火元帥
那我們在這裏改變世界？
You explained to the fire marshal
that we're in here changing the world?

98
00:04:28,885 --> 00:04:32,855
我做到了，但是除非我們也可以改變
火的性質，他並不在乎。
I did, but unless we can also change
the properties of fire, he doesn't care.

99
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,492
- 史蒂夫...
- 發生火災導致踩踏無人盯防的出口，
- Steve...
- If a fire causes a stampede to the unmarked exits,

100
00:04:35,493 --> 00:04:37,894
它會一直很值得
這對於那些誰生存。
it'll have been well worth
it for those who survive.

101
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:40,497
對於那些誰不這樣做，少
所以，但還是相當不錯的。
For those who don't, less
so, but still pretty good.

102
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:43,199
- 你看，我...
- 我需要它走到黑。 真正的黑色。
- Look, I...
- I need it to go black. Real black.

103
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,134
擺脫出口標誌和
不要讓我知道你是如何做到的。
Get rid of the exit signs and
don't let me know how you did it.

104
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:48,539
修復的聲音演示。
Fix the voice demo.

105
00:04:51,976 --> 00:04:54,511
您需要特殊的工具來打開Mac？
You need special tools to open the Mac?

106
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:56,278
你知道這是一個封閉的系統。
You knew it was a closed system.

107
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,915
我不知道從字面上。 耶穌。
I didn't know literally. Jesus.

108
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,117
如果你繼續這樣疏遠
人們沒有理由，
And if you keep alienating
people for no reason,

109
00:05:01,118 --> 00:05:03,752
還有的會是誰
左為它打個招呼。
there's gonna be no one
left for it to say hello to.

110
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:05,120
這不是沒有理由。
It's not for no reason.

111
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:08,658
我們打​​擊這一點，IBM將擁有
未來50年如蝙蝠俠反派。
We blow this and IBM will own the
next 50 years like a Batman villain.

112
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:11,995
記住電話公司？ 那是什麼
貝爾被稱為「電話公司」。
Remember the phone company? That's what
Bell was called, "the phone company."

113
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:14,062
IBM將電腦公司。
IBM will be the computer company.

114
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,766
十年後，他們會
是信息的公司，
Ten years later they'll
be the information company,

115
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:19,168
而這是非常不好的人類。
and that's very bad for the human race.

116
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:21,971
因此，我們沒有時間來
禮貌還是現實，
So we don't have time to
be polite or realistic,

117
00:05:21,972 --> 00:05:24,540
「因為如果我們到了，這
公司的下一個產品的推出
'cause if we are, this
company's next product launch

118
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,108
將在26人面前舉行
will be held in front of 26 people

119
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:28,944
並從縱梁
阿拉米達縣購物指南。
and a stringer from the
Alameda County Shopper's Guide.

120
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:31,047
我們還沒有發佈的語音軟體。
We haven't advertised the voice software.

121
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:34,951
我們可以將其拉出演示
沒有人會感到失望。
We could pull it out of the demo
and no one would be disappointed.

122
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:37,052
你想嘗試是合理的，
Do you want to try being reasonable,

123
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:41,291
只是，你知道，看看是什麼感覺？
just, you know, see what it feels like?

124
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:47,096
好。 拉的聲音演示。
Okay. Pull the voice demo.

125
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,031
謝謝。
Thank you.

126
00:05:48,032 --> 00:05:50,165
然後取消發射。
And then cancel the launch.

127
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,668
我明白。 你剛才騙我一點點。
I see. You just tricked me a little.

128
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:55,305
你能告訴我這是多麼重要，
但如果電腦不打招呼，
You can tell me how unimportant it is,
but if the computer doesn't say hello,

129
00:05:55,306 --> 00:05:59,041
那麼也不會約翰斯卡利，
誰我答應你同意和我在一起。
then neither will John Sculley,
who I promise you agrees with me.

130
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:02,711
斯卡利不是要取消
推出「因為他是不是瘋了。
Sculley's not gonna cancel the
launch 'cause he's not insane.

131
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:04,947
他也不是一個黑客，和
當涉及到Macintosh，
He's also not a hack, and
when it comes to the Macintosh,

132
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,649
他會做什麼，我問他做什麼。
he's gonna do what I ask him to do.

133
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,185
- 什麼是在這個盒子？
- 沒有什麼需要擔心的。
- What's in this box?
- Nothing you need to worry about.

134
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:10,720
甚至不要打開它。
Don't even open it.

135
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:12,754
什麼他媽的？
What the fuck?

136
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:15,692
為什麼會出現的紙箱......這是誰幹的？
Why is there a carton of... Who did this?

137
00:06:15,693 --> 00:06:17,427
- 有人認為...
- 誰？
- Somebody thought...
- Who?

138
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:21,697
無所謂。 認為這將是一個很好的
主意，有那<I>時間</i>的封面複印件
Doesn't matter. Thought it would be a good
idea to have copies of that <i>Time</i> cover

139
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:23,233
可在每個人的座位。
available at everyone's seat.

140
00:06:23,234 --> 00:06:26,302
它消滅在萌芽狀態，所有的
副本正在採取走出大樓。
It was nipped in the bud and all the
copies are being taken out of the building.

141
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,937
所以，問題就解決了​​。
So problem solved.

142
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:30,872
- 這不是一個Macintosh計算機。
- 我明白。
- This isn't a Macintosh.
- I understand.

143
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:32,975
有人以為它會
是個不錯的主意，比如，
Somebody thought it would
be a good idea to, like,

144
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:37,747
熱情交出的副本
<I>時間</i>替換封面上的一個不-A-的Macintosh
enthusiastically hand over copies of
<i>Time</i> with a not-a-Macintosh on the cover

145
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:39,382
在推出的Macintosh電腦的？
at the launch of the Macintosh?

146
00:06:39,383 --> 00:06:41,283
什麼是他們遞過
出在惠普？
What are they handing
out at Hewlett-Packard?

147
00:06:41,284 --> 00:06:43,286
蘋果與我的臉對他們的鬥？
A bushel of apples with my face on them?

148
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:46,889
我敢肯定的想法是，
因為計算機是年度人物
I'm sure the thinking was that
since the computer is Man of the Year

149
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,358
那這是很好的為我們的業務，
that that's good for our business,

150
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:50,759
但就像我說的，我有
他們從建築物中刪除。
but like I said, I'm having
them removed from the building.

151
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,129
我想請你與他們無關
就是把他們所有2600份，
What I'd like you to do with them
is to take them, all 2,600 copies,

152
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,932
和堆棧他們的Kottke的辦公桌
and stack them on Kottke's desk

153
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:58,033
並告訴他史蒂夫說，
「祝你新年快樂。」
and tell him Steve says,
"Happy New Year to you."

154
00:06:58,034 --> 00:06:58,935
好。
Okay.

155
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:01,204
我給了<I>時間</i>雜誌的完全訪問權限。
I gave <i>Time</i> magazine full access.

156
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:03,906
整個校園：Bandley，蘋果II，麗莎。
The whole campus: Bandley, Apple II, Lisa.

157
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:08,411
我給了他斯卡利，馬庫拉。 一世
給了他沃茲。 我給他的每一個人。
I gave him Sculley, Markkula. I
gave him Woz. I gave him everybody.

158
00:07:08,412 --> 00:07:11,781
我應該叫誰想到人
它會是交出這些出一個好主意嗎？
What should I call the person who thought
it'd be a good idea to hand these out?

159
00:07:11,782 --> 00:07:14,016
我不會告訴你是誰。
I'm not telling you who it was.

160
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,386
有人做過沒有惡意。
它得到照顧。
It was done without malice.
It's been taken care of.

161
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:19,254
你有一個半小時，我們
有事情要談。
You have a half hour and we
have things to talk about.

162
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:20,923
像什麼？
Like what?

163
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:24,793
就像在頭90天百萬。
Like a million in the first 90 days.

164
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:26,194
- 喬安娜...
-  20,000個月後。
- Joanna...
- 20,000 a month after that.

165
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,562
- 看。 這些都是預測。
- 我求...
- Look. Those are the forecasts.
- I'm begging...

166
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:33,403
這是我的領域。 我求你
管理期望在那裏。
This is my field. I'm begging you
to manage expectations out there.

167
00:07:33,404 --> 00:07:37,939
- 我煽動的期望。
- 我們不會在頭90天賣出一百萬。
- I'm fanning expectations.
- We're not gonna sell a million in the first 90 days.

168
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,744
每個人，每個人，每個人，
Everyone, everyone, everyone,

169
00:07:41,745 --> 00:07:44,312
<I>每個人</i>正在等待蘋果。
<i>everyone</i> is waiting for the Mac.

170
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:46,115
有可能。
Maybe.

171
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:49,018
但是，會發生什麼，當他們
找出了2,495，
But what happens when they
find out that for 2,495,

172
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:52,120
還有，你可以用它做什麼？
there's nothing you can do with it?

173
00:07:52,121 --> 00:07:54,423
我們為$ 1,500個有競爭力的，
We were competitive at $1,500,

174
00:07:54,424 --> 00:07:58,360
但一旦你更換了
摩托羅拉6809與68000 ...
but once you replaced the
Motorola 6809 with the 68000...

175
00:07:58,361 --> 00:08:02,098
這正是支持菜單，窗口，
指向和點擊，高分辨率的圖形...
Which is what supports menus, windows,
point and click, high-res graphics...

176
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,334
呀，因為每個人都需要
矩形帶圓角。
Yeah, 'cause everyone needs
rectangles with rounded corners.

177
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:09,907
土地教練在跑道上的
確切的同時，頭等艙。
Coach lands on the runway at the
exact same time as first class.

178
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,778
我沒有第一
他媽的知道這意味著什麼，
I don't have the first
fucking idea what that means,

179
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:17,747
但是這是怎麼得$ 2,500
but this is how it got to $2,500,

180
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:21,084
這是對價格點
PC機，它可以做更多的事情！
which is the price point on
the PC, which can do a lot more!

181
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:24,353
誰的會想要一台PC？
什麼白癡是要去想...
Who's gonna want a PC?
What idiot is gonna want...

182
00:08:24,354 --> 00:08:27,889
如果我想告訴你有一個點
在你的襯衫，我點到現場。
If I wanna tell you there's a spot
on your shirt, I point to the spot.

183
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,827
我不說有一個點14
從衣領厘米下來
I don't say there's a spot 14
centimeters down from the collar

184
00:08:31,828 --> 00:08:33,796
三厘米到的
右邊的第二個按鈕
and three centimeters to the
right of the second button

185
00:08:33,797 --> 00:08:36,932
當我試圖記住什麼
該命令對蘇打水。
while I try to remember what
the command is for club soda.

186
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,934
這不是一個人如何的心靈的作品。
That's not how a person's mind works.

187
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:43,740
如果目標是便於使用，也許
你應該已經給它一些內存。
If the goal was ease of use, maybe
you should've given it some memory.

188
00:08:43,741 --> 00:08:46,374
你可以抱怨內存
或者你可以抱怨的價格，
You can complain about memory
or you can complain about price,

189
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,445
但你不能同時做到這兩點。
but you can't do both at the same time.

190
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,413
內存是要花錢的。
Memory is what costs money.

191
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:53,883
我很高興你告訴我
您對Mac的現在的心情
I'm glad you're telling me
your feelings about the Mac now

192
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:55,518
因為我們有一個半小時離開。
because we have a half hour left.

193
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,153
我們可以重新設計它。
We can redesign it.

194
00:08:57,154 --> 00:08:59,889
我只是要求你管理的期望。
I'm just asking you to manage expectations.

195
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,857
看看他們的臉
當他們看到它是什麼。
Look at their faces
when they see what it is.

196
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:05,193
他們不知道自己在做什麼
看著或者他們為什麼喜歡它，
They won't know what they're
looking at or why they like it,

197
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:07,230
但他們會知道他們想要的。
but they'll know they want it.

198
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:09,999
不是瞬間。 當人們
聽到<I>春之祭，</i>
Not instantly. When people
heard <i>Rite of Spring,</i>

199
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,235
他們撕毀椅子走出影院。
they tore the chairs out of the theater.

200
00:09:12,236 --> 00:09:13,436
他們沒有購買記錄。
They didn't buy the record.

201
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:16,371
<I>春之祭</i>的情況
是最革命性
<i>Rite of Spring</i> happens
to be the most revolutionary

202
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:18,039
和挑釁性的交響樂
上個世紀。
and provocative symphony
of the last century.

203
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,375
芭蕾舞。 這是一個芭蕾舞。
Ballet. It was a ballet.

204
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:24,246
但斯特拉文斯基並沒有說他
要去一個月銷售20000台。
But Igor Stravinsky didn't say he
was gonna sell 20,000 units a month.

205
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:26,883
我不知道為什麼我們
談論斯特拉文斯基
I don't know why we're
talking about Stravinsky

206
00:09:26,884 --> 00:09:31,086
當我關心的是丹科特肯
雞姦我在<I>時間</i>雜誌。
when what I care about is Dan Kottke
sodomizing me in <i>Time</i> magazine.

207
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:35,390
看。 明顯...
Look. Obviously...

208
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:37,360
讓我這樣說你。
Let me say this to you.

209
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:40,462
顯然，丹尼爾沒有想到
他在做什麼錯。
Obviously, Daniel didn't think
he was doing anything wrong.

210
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:44,033
- 通過交談，<I>時間</i>的呢？
- 是啊。
- By talking to <i>Time</i> about it?
- Yeah.

211
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:46,067
我不知道這意味著什麼。
I don't know what that means.

212
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:48,804
你說，當你告訴我的故事...
You said, when you told me the story...

213
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:50,907
你說你到丹說，
You said you said to Dan,

214
00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:53,842
「難道<I>時間</i>的雜誌問你
如果我有一個名為麗莎的女兒嗎？「
"Did <i>Time</i> magazine ask you
if I had a daughter named Lisa?"

215
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,378
而丹說，「是啊。」
And Dan said, "Yeah."

216
00:09:56,847 --> 00:10:00,316
我的意思是，他回答
你只需和誠實
My point was that he answered
you simply and honestly

217
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:02,451
因為他不認為
他做任何事。
because he didn't think
he'd done anything wrong.

218
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:07,222
除非，喬安娜......除了我
沒有一個叫麗莎的女兒。
Except, Joanna... Except I
don't have a daughter named Lisa.

219
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:11,159
而這個故事現在大概我是如何
拒絕親子鑒定，並採取了驗血。
And this story is now about how I'm
denying paternity and took a blood test.

220
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,496
這就是為什麼有一個圖片...
我不知道他媽的這是什麼。
And that's why there's a picture of...
I don't know what the fuck that is.

221
00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:16,999
這就是為什麼有一個
在封面上的PC機圖片
That's why there's a
picture of a PC on the cover

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,570
代替我和Mac的圖片。
instead of a picture of me and the Mac.

223
00:10:20,571 --> 00:10:22,938
我不知道該怎麼告訴你。
I don't know what to tell you.

224
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:26,609
我應該是<I>時間</i>
雜誌的年度人物。
I was supposed to be <i>Time</i>
magazine's Man of the Year.

225
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,279
然後丹Kottke的誕生。
And then Dan Kottke was born.

226
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:36,085
- 井...
- 什麼？
- Well...
- What?

227
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:40,188
- 她在等待著你。
- 誰？
- She's waiting for you.
- Who?

228
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:42,158
-  Chrisann。
- 布倫南？
- Chrisann.
- Brennan?

229
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,625
他們在大廳裏。
They're out in the hall.

230
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:47,129
他們已經坐在後面
因為7:00今天早上的禮堂。
They've been sitting in the back of
the auditorium since 7:00 this morning.

231
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,566
我並沒有把會話
與Chrisann現在。
I'm not having a session
with Chrisann right now.

232
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:54,269
我們發出335新聞
憑據推出。
We issued 335 press
credentials for the launch.

233
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,273
史蒂夫，你激怒Chrisann，
Steve, you piss off Chrisann,

234
00:10:57,274 --> 00:11:00,543
她傻傻的站在了
遊說，並給335的採訪，
she's gonna stand in the
lobby and give 335 interviews,

235
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:05,783
而你，夥計，會嚮往
太平日子丹的Kottke的。
and you, pal, will be longing for
the halcyon days of Dan Kottke.

236
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,219
讓我結束這。
Let me get this over with.

237
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,520
但是，不要離開。 你會留在這兒。
But don't leave. You're gonna stay here.

238
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:13,956
什麼？ 不，我不是。
What? No. I'm not.

239
00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:17,426
號有較少的一個機會
現場，如果你留在這兒。 她會很酷。
No. There's less of a chance of a
scene if you stay here. She'll be cool.

240
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:22,298
我覺得這一切難以忍受
個人及-和...
I find all this excruciatingly
personal and-and...

241
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:24,933
我 - 我......我不能呆在這。
I-I'm... I'm not staying.

242
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,434
第來吧。
No. Come on.

243
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,639
我並不想成為一個
房間單獨與Chrisann。
I don't wanna be in a
room alone with Chrisann.

244
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:34,945
這是我和你。
This is me and you.

245
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,917
精細。
Fine.

246
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,093
嘿。
Hey.

247
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,931
史蒂夫。
Steve.

248
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:56,298
這是一個驚喜。
This is a surprise.

249
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,600
在你為什麼不來呢？
Why don't you come on in?

250
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:00,837
謝謝。
Thank you.

251
00:12:03,073 --> 00:12:05,474
- 你來了嗎？
- 是的，我不會離開她在走廊上。
- You coming too?
- Yes, I'm not gonna leave her in the hallway.

252
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,943
好。 這是一個安全走廊，但無論如何。
Okay. It's a safe hallway, but anyway.

253
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:10,712
你還記得喬安娜·霍夫曼？ 她
市場部主管為Mac。
You remember Joanna Hoffman? She's
the head of marketing for the Mac.

254
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:13,182
很高興見到你。
Good to see you.

255
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,650
很高興見到你。 你好，麗莎。
Nice to see you. Hello, Lisa.

256
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,653
我們以前見過的，你告訴
我你喜歡我說話的方式，
We've met before, and you told
me you like the way I talk,

257
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:22,357
那是我最喜歡的
事情任何人的以往任何時候都對我說。
and that was my favorite
thing anyone's ever said to me.

258
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:24,360
- 你是來自波蘭。
- 對，我是。
- You're from Poland.
- Yes, I am.

259
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:27,129
- 你知道那是什麼？
- 地球的頂部。
- Do you know where that is?
- The top of the Earth.

260
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,097
我想，你在想北極。
I think you're thinking of the North Pole.

261
00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:30,999
好了，我們有點
時間緊迫，所以...
Well, we're a little
pressed for time, so...

262
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,402
- 我會離開你們一個人。
- 為什麼你想離開的時候，你剛才說的...
- I'll leave you guys alone.
- Why do you wanna leave when you just said...

263
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:35,839
我要去檢查與赫茨菲爾德。
I'm gonna check in with Hertzfeld.

264
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:45,548
我們正在試圖獲得一個
電腦打個招呼，
We're trying to get a
computer to say hello,

265
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:48,116
但現在它是非常害羞。
but right now it's being very shy.

266
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:50,052
你會不會幫助我嗎？ 可以嗎？
Would you come help me? Is that okay?

267
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:51,653
當然。
Sure.

268
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:54,123
謝謝。
Thank you.

269
00:12:54,124 --> 00:12:56,057
我爸我的名字命名的計算機。
My dad named a computer after me.

270
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:59,495
我不是你的......
I'm not your...

271
00:12:59,496 --> 00:13:02,731
其實，你知道是什麼
巧合的是，麗莎？
Actually, do you know what
a coincidence is, Lisa?

272
00:13:02,732 --> 00:13:05,169
沒有。
No.

273
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,404
就像如果你遇到了什麼人。
Like if you met someone.

274
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:11,706
你犯了一個新朋友
她的名字叫麗莎了。
You made a new friend
and her name was Lisa too.

275
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,576
這將是一個巧合。
That would be a coincidence.

276
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:16,578
「麗莎」的全稱是「本地
集成系統架構「。
"Lisa" stands for "Local
Integrated Systems Architecture."

277
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:19,215
L-I-S-A。
L-I-S-A.

278
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:22,785
這是一個巧合。
It's a coincidence.

279
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:26,654
- 你大概做了什麼？
- 是啊。
- You about done?
- Yeah.

280
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,489
好。
Okay.

281
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:32,930
來。 讓我們的電腦打招呼。
Come. Let's make that computer say hi.

282
00:13:34,197 --> 00:13:36,097
來吧，麗莎。
Go ahead, Lisa.

283
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:39,268
所以這是周圍的其他方法。
So it was the other way around.

284
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:41,537
我被評為計算機後？
I was named after the computer?

285
00:13:41,538 --> 00:13:44,807
沒有被命名後，
任何人。 這是一個巧合。
Nothing was named after
anybody. It's a coincidence.

286
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:47,144
加油。
Come on.

287
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:53,383
你到底是怎麼回事？
What's the matter with you?

288
00:13:53,384 --> 00:13:55,583
你到底是怎麼回事？ 為什麼
你要告訴她這事嗎？
What's the matter with you? Why
are you telling her these things?

289
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,552
為什麼你還告訴
她我是她的父親嗎？
Why are you still telling
her I'm her father?

290
00:13:57,553 --> 00:13:59,455
- 法官告訴她，你是她的父親。
- 不，他沒有。
- A judge told her you're her father.
- No, he didn't.

291
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:01,322
當你到底下車
告訴<I>時間</i>雜誌
Where the hell do you get off
telling <i>Time</i> magazine

292
00:14:01,323 --> 00:14:03,325
我已經睡了28％
的男子在美國？
I've slept with 28 percent
of the men in America?

293
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:05,293
- 這不是...
- 你在哪裏下車？
- That's not...
- Where do you get off?

294
00:14:05,294 --> 00:14:08,130
這不是遠程我說。
That's not remotely what I said.

295
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:13,168
就是這裏。
It's right here.

296
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:15,137
首先，我可以告訴你
一些關於<I>時間</i>的雜誌？
First of all, can I tell you
something about <i>Time</i> magazine?

297
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:17,840
我相信這是一個培訓
設施支付的刺客。
I believe it's a training
facility for paid assassins.

298
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:21,342
- 「喬布斯堅持」...我引用...
- 我沒有發明的數學。
- "Jobs insists"... I am quoting...
- I didn't invent math.

299
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:24,480
的「28％的
男性人口美國
"twenty-eight percent of the
male population of the United States

300
00:14:24,481 --> 00:14:26,615
可能是爸爸。「
could be the father."

301
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:30,619
我不是說你睡
隨著美國男性28％。
I wasn't saying you've slept
with 28% of American men.

302
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,522
我使用的算法
基於該血液檢查
I was using an algorithm
based on the blood test

303
00:14:33,523 --> 00:14:37,659
它說，有94.1％
的機會，我的父親。
which said there was a 94.1%
chance that I'm the father.

304
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,863
你試圖公開
把我描述成一個蕩婦和妓女。
You're trying to publicly
paint me as a slut and a whore.

305
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:43,365
相信我，我不是要
公開做你任何東西。
Believe me, I'm not trying to
publicly do anything with you.

306
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:45,067
兩百萬人閱讀
<I>時間。</i>我怎麼...
Two million people read
<i>Time.</i> How am I supposed...

307
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:48,703
這將是更多，如果他們把我的封面上，
但丹科特肯決定以腎虛衝我...
It would be more if they put me on the cover,
but Dan Kottke decided to kidney-punch me...

308
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:51,874
- 我昨天申請了福利。
- 對不起？
- I applied for welfare yesterday.
- I'm sorry?

309
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,878
- 您好！
- 我說我昨天申請福利。
- Hello!
- I said I applied for welfare yesterday.

310
00:14:56,178 --> 00:15:00,615
在<I>時間</i>的文章稱您
蘋果股票是價值$ 441億美元，
The <i>Time</i> article said your
Apple stock was worth $441 million,

311
00:15:00,616 --> 00:15:02,750
我想問你
你怎麼感覺有關。
and I wanted to ask you
how you felt about that.

312
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,587
好吧，我覺得蘋果股票
已被嚴重低估。
Well, I feel like Apple stock
has been dramatically undervalued.

313
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:07,523
這將是一個很好的時間去研究。
This would be a good time to get in.

314
00:15:07,524 --> 00:15:10,259
你的女兒和她的母親......
Your daughter and her mother...

315
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,461
-  Chrisann ...
- 是的福利。
- Chrisann...
- are on welfare.

316
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:15,197
我們住在門洛帕克一個小屋。
We're living in a hovel in Menlo Park.

317
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:16,698
我們不能支付取暖費。
We can't pay the heating bills.

318
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:19,235
她睡在一個大衣。
She sleeps in a parka.

319
00:15:19,236 --> 00:15:21,537
- 您的女兒......
- 她不是我的女兒！
- Your daughter...
- She's not my daughter!

320
00:15:21,538 --> 00:15:24,572
因為，據報道
按<I>時間</i>的雜誌，
Because, as reported
by <i>Time</i> magazine,

321
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:27,543
- 我已經睡了的人在美國，28％？
- 沒有。
- I've slept with 28% of the men in America?
- No.

322
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:31,148
所有這些，恰恰就是個
麗莎的前幾個月就誕生了。
All of them, exactly nine
months before Lisa was born.

323
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:38,287
我有安迪在這裏。
I've got Andy here.

324
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,331
打擾一下。
Excuse me.

325
00:15:56,405 --> 00:15:57,572
在那裏？
We're there?

326
00:15:57,573 --> 00:15:59,575
- 嘿，克裏斯。
- 嘿，安迪。
- Hey, Chris.
- Hey, Andy.

327
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:01,342
- 你最近怎樣'？
- 可怕。
- How are you doin'?
- Terrible.

328
00:16:01,343 --> 00:16:02,677
你們趕上了嗎？
You guys caught up now?

329
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:05,313
請原諒我說一下我的
朋友，誰認為你是一個傢伙。
Excuse me for saying hello to my
friend, who thinks you're a dick.

330
00:16:05,314 --> 00:16:06,715
- 我不認為你是一個...
- 在那裏？
- I don't think you're a...
- We're there?

331
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,751
- 號它有一在六個機會的工作。
- 他媽的。
- No. It's got a one-in-six chance of working.
- Goddamn it.

332
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:14,590
那麼，我們是不是一個維修人員在Daytona。
這不能被固定在秒。
Well, we're not a pit crew at Daytona.
This can't be fixed in seconds.

333
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,458
你沒有秒。
你有三個星期。
You didn't have seconds.
You had three weeks.

334
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:20,528
被創造宇宙
在那段時間的三分之一。
The universe was created
in a third of that time.

335
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:22,798
好了，有一天你會擁有
告訴我們你是怎麼做的。
Well, someday you'll have
to tell us how you did it.

336
00:16:26,303 --> 00:16:28,736
下面是我該怎麼辦。
Here's what I'm gonna do.

337
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:32,874
我要宣佈的名字
大家誰設計了發射演示。
I'm gonna announce the names of
everyone who designed the launch demo.

338
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,677
我要介紹給大家
並要求他們站起來。
I'm gonna introduce everyone
and ask them to stand up.

339
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:37,980
該袋是由蘇珊·卡蕾設計。
The bag was designed by Susan Kare.

340
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:41,884
在Macintosh字體多數民眾贊成在整個滾動
屏幕由史蒂夫·卡普斯設計。
The Macintosh font that's scrolling across
the screen was designed by Steve Capps.

341
00:16:41,885 --> 00:16:45,221
星夜和
空中文字是布魯斯·霍恩。
The starry night and
skywriting was Bruce Horn.

342
00:16:45,222 --> 00:16:50,859
MacPaint格式，MacWrite，愛麗絲，
下到計算器。
MacPaint, MacWrite, Alice,
down to the calculator.

343
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,762
然後我會說，
語音演示，沒有工作
And then I'm gonna say the
voice demo that didn't work

344
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,667
由安迪·赫茲菲爾德設計的。
was designed by Andy Hertzfeld.

345
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,238
史蒂夫...
Steve...

346
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:07,508
五在六個是你生存的機會
第一輪俄羅斯輪盤賭的，
Five-in-six is your chance of surviving
the first round of Russian roulette,

347
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:09,378
你已經逆轉的可能性。
and you've reversed those odds.

348
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:11,580
所以，除非你想被蒙羞
在你的朋友面前，
So unless you wanna be disgraced
in front of your friends,

349
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:14,783
家人，同事，
股東和媒體，
family, colleagues,
stockholders and the press,

350

Does anyone know what size shirt
he wears? What size shirt I wear?

their favorite teacher with them 24 hours.

I don't want to insult Woz. I
just think it's backward-looking

459

472
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:12,167
有一個小女孩誰
相信你是她的父親。
There's a small girl who
believes you're her father.

473
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:16,671
就這樣。 這是所有的數學存在。
That's all. That's all the math there is.

474
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:20,207
她認為它。 什麼是
你打算怎麼辦呢？
She believes it. What are
you gonna do about that?

475
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,977
上帝派他唯一的兒子在一自殺任務，
God sent his only son on a suicide mission,

476
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:26,682
但我們喜歡他呢
因為他做了樹木。
but we like him anyway
because he made trees.

477
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,918
我們要賣出一百萬
單元中的第一個90天。
We're gonna sell a million
units in the first 90 days.

478
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:32,987
20000一個月後。
20,000 a month after that.

479
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:35,792
因此，也許你可以給
我休息一下，霍夫曼女士？
So maybe you could give
me a break, Ms. Hoffman?

480
00:25:27,376 --> 00:25:29,377
- 沃茲。
- 嘿。
- Woz.
- Hey.

481
00:25:29,378 --> 00:25:32,013
有沒有在該自動售貨機
機器不會殺你。
There's nothing in that vending
machine that won't kill you.

482
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:34,248
- 只是瀏覽。
- 讓我們出去走走。
- Just browsing.
- Let's take a walk.

483
00:25:34,249 --> 00:25:36,350
- 我能告訴你一些事嗎？
- 是啊。
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah.

484
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:39,754
在毛伊島，蘋果會後
二隊感到不滿和憤怒和向下。
After the meeting in Maui, the Apple
II team was upset and angry and down.

485
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:42,157
- 你知道為什麼嗎？
- 由於蘋果II中沒有提到甚至一度？
- Do you know why?
- Because the Apple II wasn't mentioned even once?

486
00:25:42,158 --> 00:25:44,793
蘋果II並沒有提及電動汽車...
The Apple II wasn't mentioned ev...

487
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:46,427
對，就是那樣。 你擁有了它。 是。
Yes, that's it. You have it. Yes.

488
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:49,531
- 這不是一個疏忽。
- 他們知道這一點。 他們知道事實並非如此。
- That wasn't an oversight.
- They know that. They know it wasn't.

489
00:25:49,532 --> 00:25:51,766
我不想做一個
大不了出這...
I don't wanna make a
big deal out of this...

490
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:53,334
這完全是你的能力範圍內。
That's entirely within your power.

491
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:56,103
- 蘋果II是...
- 蘋果II是什麼，朋友。
- The Apple II is...
- The Apple II is what was, my friend.

492
00:25:56,104 --> 00:25:59,808
蘋果II是支付帳單
在這裏，擁有七年。
The Apple II is what pays the bills
around here and has for seven years.

493
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:01,075
如果你為難這些人，
And if you embarrass these people,

494
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:04,044
你會看到一個大腦
漏在這家公司，我的兄弟。
you are going to see a brain
drain at this company, my brother.

495
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:06,814
馬庫拉帶你離開麗莎，不
他們，而不是我，所以不怪？
Markkula took you off the Lisa, not
them and not me, so don't blame...

496
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:11,319
馬庫拉了，因為我從他的麗莎
強烈的宗教反對使它好。
Markkula took me off the Lisa because of his
strong religious objection to making it good.

497
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,188
現在我給你的一切
你想在Apple II。
Now I gave you everything
you wanted on the Apple II.

498
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:15,924
你不要問了很多？
You don't ask for a lot?

499
00:26:15,925 --> 00:26:18,392
有沒有一個單一的戰鬥，你失去了。
There wasn't a single fight you lost.

500
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:20,962
你承認的插槽中
原因是蘋果II的成功？
Do you concede the slots are the
reason for the success of the Apple II?

501
00:26:20,963 --> 00:26:23,098
- 我們不能仍然是談論插槽。
- 我有一個點。
- We can't still be talking about the slots.
- I have a point.

502
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:26,066
它已經七年。 你還是
正在做。 你在談論的插槽。
It's been seven years. You're still
doing it. You're talking about the slots.

503
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:29,004
有些事你錯了。
這種說法開始在車庫裏。
There's something wrong with you.
This argument started in the garage.

504
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:33,809
你在說什麼？ 為什麼
你會只想要兩​​個插槽？
What are you talking about? Why
would you only want two slots?

505
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,811
打印機和調製解調器。
A printer and a modem.

506
00:26:35,812 --> 00:26:37,344
8個插槽，你...
With eight slots, you...

507
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:40,415
這是一個巨大的交易，我們
能夠增加8插槽。
This is a huge deal that we
were able to add eight slots.

508
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:43,318
我很欣賞的工程，
但它不是我們在做什麼。
I appreciate the engineering,
but it's not what we're doing.

509
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:45,020
- 感謝上帝我贏了這樣的說法？
- 沃茲。
- And thank God I won that argument...
- Woz.

510
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:47,822
由於開放系統是什麼
人們喜歡的機器，
Because the open system is what
people love about the machine,

511
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:49,323
它就是為什麼它出售，仍然銷售。
and it's why it sold and still sells.

512
00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:51,993
一個開放的系統。 我們
不是做一個開放的系統。
An open system. We're
not doing an open system.

513
00:26:51,994 --> 00:26:55,964
當然我們。 這就是人們想要什麼，
和蘋果II的突破...
Of course we are. That's what people want,
and the breakthrough on the Apple II...

514
00:26:55,965 --> 00:26:58,833
人們不知道他們
想直到你展示給他們。
People don't know what they
want until you show it to them.

515
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:03,504
嚴重的用戶想要自定義。 他們
想修改。 他們想托住它。
Serious users want to customize. They
wanna modify. They wanna jack it up.

516
00:27:03,505 --> 00:27:07,042
他們希望硬體工程師一樣
我以擴展其性能，好嗎？
They want hardware engineers like
me to expand its capabilities, okay?

517
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:08,976
鍵盤音樂，更好的音板，
Keyboards for music, better sound board,

518
00:27:08,977 --> 00:27:10,879
更好的顯示板，
改進的內存卡。
better display boards,
improved memory cards.

519
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,215
而這就是為什麼有
3000人在這裏現在。
And it's why there are
3,000 people here right now.

520
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:17,252
槽是什麼讓蘋果II
跑，只是一個例子，VisiCalc的，
The slots are what allowed the Apple II
to run, for just one example, VisiCalc,

521
00:27:17,253 --> 00:27:21,356
從我的猜測一手賣
20萬和30萬的機器。
which from my guess single-handedly sold
between 200,000 and 300,000 machines.

522
00:27:21,357 --> 00:27:24,325
- 他們想插槽。
- 他們沒有得到一票。
- They want slots.
- They don't get a vote.

523
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:27,862
當迪倫寫的「擋風遮雨，」他
沒有要求人們作出貢獻的歌詞。
When Dylan wrote "Shelter from the Storm," he
didn't ask people to contribute to the lyrics.

524
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:29,864
戲劇不停止這樣的
劇作家可以問觀眾
Plays don't stop so the
playwright can ask the audience

525
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:31,233
他們會是什麼景象希望看到下一個。
what scene they'd like to see next.

526
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:32,200
- 畫家...
- 愛好者...
- Painters...
- Hobbyists...

527
00:27:32,201 --> 00:27:35,870
我們瀕臨
一個構造...愛好者？
We're on the verge of
a tectonic... Hobbyists?

528
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:37,806
打印機和調製解調器。 兩個插槽。
A printer and a modem. Two slots.

529
00:27:39,108 --> 00:27:41,008
蘋果II球隊有我的感情，
The Apple II team has my affection,

530
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:44,478
但我不愛了七年之久
產品在蘋果推出。
but I'm not loving up a seven-year-old
product at the Mac launch.

531
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:47,882
- 電腦是不是畫。
- 你他媽的。
- Computers aren't paintings.
- Fuck you.

532
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:51,285
我會說，每次「你他媽的」你
說，直到你死亡或者停止。
I'm gonna say "fuck you" every time you
say that until you either die or stop.

533
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:52,987
- 史蒂夫...
- 嘗試一下。
- Steve...
- Try it.

534
00:27:52,988 --> 00:27:54,121
- 史蒂夫。
- 說出來。
- Steve.
- Say it.

535
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:56,925
- 電腦是不是畫。
- 你他媽的。
- Computers aren't paintings.
- Fuck you.

536
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,995
是的，他們是些什麼人
我要的是一個封閉的系統。
Yes, they are, and what
I want is a closed system.

537
00:27:59,996 --> 00:28:04,100
端至端的控制。 全然
有什麼不兼容。
End-to-end control. Completely
incompatible with anything.

538
00:28:08,137 --> 00:28:10,572
計算機是不應該
有人類的缺陷。
Computers aren't supposed
to have human flaws.

539
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:14,009
我不打算建立這個與你。
I'm not going to build this one with yours.

540
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,553
史蒂夫！
Steve!

541
00:28:26,554 --> 00:28:27,589
嘿。
Hey.

542
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:31,225
今天是關於Macintosh電腦。
和Mac是我的。
Today is about the Macintosh.
And the Mac is mine.

543
00:28:31,226 --> 00:28:32,994
- 我給你的。
- 謝謝。
- I give you that.
- Thank you.

544
00:28:32,995 --> 00:28:35,397
我給你說。 剛剛公開
承認蘋果II團隊
I give you that. Just publicly
acknowledge the Apple II team

545
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:36,831
「因為這是正確的事情。
'cause it's the right thing to do.

546
00:28:36,832 --> 00:28:40,467
我們就會知道很快，如果你是
達芬奇或只是想你，
We'll know soon enough if you are
Leonardo da Vinci or just think you are,

547
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,236
但在此期間，這將是巨大的...
but in the meantime, it would be great...

548
00:28:42,237 --> 00:28:45,139
在此期間，蘋果II完成。
In the meantime, the Apple II is done.

549
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,207
七年。 這是一個偉大的運行。
Seven years. It was a great run.

550
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:49,746
你應該出門
房子和你坐下。
You should go out in the
house and take your seat.

551
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,448
Mac的是傑夫·拉斯金的。
The Mac is Jef Raskin's.

552
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:56,051
說出來對我來說。
Say it for me.

553
00:28:56,052 --> 00:28:57,518
- 電腦是不是...
- 你他媽的。
- Computers aren't...
- Fuck you.

554
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,486
好吧。
All right.

555
00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:06,062
五，六...
Five, six...

556
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:09,097
- 在那裏？
- 我需要更多的時間。
- We're there?
- I need more time.

557
00:29:09,098 --> 00:29:11,131
- 你不能擁有它。
- 20分鐘。
- You can't have it.
- 20 minutes.

558
00:29:11,132 --> 00:29:13,435
- 這是8:58。
- 我們可以起步較晚。
- It's 8:58.
- We can start late.

559
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:16,236
聽我說。 我們是一家電腦
公司。 我們不能起步較晚。
Hear me. We're a computer
company. We can't start late.

560
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:18,305
- 然後，我有另一種想法。
- 什麼？
- Then I have another idea.
- What?

561
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:21,008
它的欺騙性和邊緣是不道德的。
It's deceptive and borderline unethical.

562
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,078
- 我在聽。
- 它會運行在512。
- I'm listening.
- It'll run on the 512.

563
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:25,045
- 你測試它？
- 是啊。
- You tested it?
- Yeah.

564
00:29:25,046 --> 00:29:29,383
- 等待。 你要去演示128計算機上的512？
- 沒有人會知道。
- Wait. You're gonna demo a 128 computer on a 512?
- Nobody's gonna know.

565
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:32,087
你認為這是
<I>邊界</i>不道德？
And you think that's
<i>borderline</i> unethical?

566
00:29:32,088 --> 00:29:34,989
名字我其他的選擇，請。
Name my other choices, please.

567
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:38,693
請。 你得告訴我，為什麼它
所以重要的是它打招呼。
Please. You have to tell me why it's
so important for it to say hello.

568
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:42,764
好萊塢。 他們做
計算機可怕的事情。
Hollywood. They made
computers scary things.

569
00:29:42,765 --> 00:29:46,400
看到這讓我想起了一個友好的你
臉，磁盤插槽是一個愚蠢的笑容？
See how this reminds you of a friendly
face, that the disk slot is a goofy grin?

570
00:29:46,401 --> 00:29:51,072
它的溫暖，它的俏皮
它需要打個招呼。
It's warm and it's playful
and it needs to say hello.

571
00:29:51,073 --> 00:29:53,408
它需要打個招呼，因為它可以。
It needs to say hello because it can.

572
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,517
我們沒有實施欺詐。
We're not committing fraud.

573
00:30:03,518 --> 00:30:06,620
512是要去船在不到一年。
The 512 is gonna ship in under a year.

574
00:30:06,621 --> 00:30:09,792
你會免除我你
東歐的不滿？
Will you absolve me of your
Eastern European disapproval?

575
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:15,629
在計算機<I> 2001年</i>的打了個招呼所有的時間
它仍然嚇死我了。
The computer in <i>2001</i> said hello all the time
and it still scared the shit out of me.

576
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,967
赦免我。
Absolve me.

577
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,602
就為了這個。
Just for this.

578
00:30:21,603 --> 00:30:24,104
而就在現在。
And just for now.

579
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:30,078
女士們，先生們，請歡迎
創始董事會成員邁克·馬庫拉。
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
founding board member Mike Markkula.

580
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,654
好吧。 好。
All right. Okay.

581
00:30:39,655 --> 00:30:42,256
去使宇宙，史蒂芬凹痕。
Go make a dent in the universe, Steven.

582
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,559
看到你在一兩個小時。
See you in a couple hours.

583
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,262
而且我要帶我們走過
本次會議的正式部分，
And I'm going to take us through
the formal part of the meeting,

584
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:48,696
法律的一部分，如果你願意。
the legal part, if you will.

585
00:30:48,697 --> 00:30:52,332
感謝仁慈的上帝。 騎兵真實體現出來。
Thank merciful God. The cavalry's shown up.

586
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:55,469
我聽說你已經比平時這更糟糕
早上。 我不認為這是可能的。
I hear you've been worse than usual this
morning. I didn't think that was possible.

587
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:59,206
所以我一直派遣
作為「史蒂夫語。」
So I've been dispatched

這是我的想像或已
你開始穿衣服喜歡我？
Is it my imagination or have
you started to dress like me?

591
00:31:11,821 --> 00:31:14,722
這是一個壞主意，有馬庫拉
與季報打開。
It was a bad idea to have Markkula
open with quarterly reports.

592
00:31:14,723 --> 00:31:16,858
相反，我們應該有剛
對觀眾落雨。
Instead we should have just
dropped water on the audience.

593

- Oh, just relax.
- Why?

596
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:27,802
我不知道。 沒人
曾經問我這個問題。
I don't know. No one's
ever asked me that question.

597

你去那裏。
There you go.

598

你是唯一一個誰看
世界以同樣的方式我這樣做。
You're the only one who sees
the world the same way I do.

599
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,217
沒有人看到的世界，你做同樣的方式。
No one sees the world the same way you do.

600
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:44,319
我就像凱撒大帝，約翰。
I'm like Julius Caesar, John.

601
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,888
- 我被敵人包圍。

只是因為你看到它他們。
Only because you see to it they are.

604
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,227
我認為這是一個良好的電路板，
I think it's a good board,

605
00:31:53,228 --> 00:31:56,397
但如果你要我推他們出去
一個接一個，我們可以談論這一點。
but if you want me to push them out
one by one, we can talk about that.

606
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:58,299
我希望你把他們均是在一次...
I want you to push them out all at once...

607
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,834
通過一個窗口，如果它是最近的出口。
through a window, if it's the nearest exit.

608
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,138
他們臉上的表情
當我們發現他們的地方。
The look on their faces
when we showed them the spot.

609
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:05,873
我看不到他們的臉，「因為他們
在表上敲打他們的頭。
I couldn't see their faces, 'cause they
were banging their heads on the table.

610
00:32:05,874 --> 00:32:09,811

We got 45 seconds. I want to
use it to ask you a question.

Why do people who are adopted feel like
they were rejected instead of selected?

我不明白的人誰放棄。
I don't understand people who give it up.

668

是什麼促使赫茨菲爾德作出這樣的選擇？
What inspired Hertzfeld to make that bet?

00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:37,677
<I>工作是打回用
新的公司和新的計算機。</i>
<i>Jobs is hitting back with a
new company and a new computer.</i>

701
00:36:37,678 --> 00:36:39,781
<I>蘋果有新的競爭者。</i>
<i>Apple has a new competitor.</i>

702
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:42,482
<I>史蒂夫·喬布斯的黑色立方體為
針對教育市場。</i>
<i>Steve Jobs's black cube is
aimed at the education market.</i>

703
00:36:42,483 --> 00:36:44,951
<I>很少有人有能力
讓世界等待，</i>
<i>Few people have the ability
to make the world wait,</i>

704
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:49,425
<I>但這正是喬布斯
與他的新公司在做，下一步</i>
<i>but that is just what Jobs is
doing with his new company, NeXT.</i>

705
00:36:57,698 --> 00:36:59,600
<I>焦點似乎有點尖銳。</i>
<i>Focus seems kind of sharp.</i>

706
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:01,134
<I>在幻燈片上？</i>
<i>On the slide?</i>

707
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,904
地上。 銷點。
The floor. The pin spot.

708
00:37:02,905 --> 00:37:04,938
我認為，我們希望有一個大家關注的焦點。
I think we want a sharp focus.

709
00:37:04,939 --> 00:37:08,442
不要往心裏去。 只是
馬戲團的審美不是一個球迷。
Don't take it personally. Just
not a fan of the circus aesthetic.

710
00:37:08,443 --> 00:37:12,446
好吧，讓我們在這裏舉行。 我們要
要上去和調整的工具。
All right, let's hold here. We're gonna
have to go up and refocus the instruments.

711
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:14,882
只一個。 30是好的。
Just one. The 30 is fine.

712
00:37:14,883 --> 00:37:18,118
雖然我們控股，有
好心人在貴賓室。
While we're holding, there are
well-wishers in the VIP room.

713
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,821
而沃茲就在這裏。
And Woz is here.

714
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:22,656
史蒂夫·沃茲尼亞克。 是。 非常感謝。
Steve Wozniak. Yes. Thank you very much.

715
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,192
<i>和安迪·赫茲菲爾德。</i>
<i>And Andy Hertzfeld.</i>

716
00:37:24,193 --> 00:37:26,594
安迪·赫茲菲爾德。 謝謝。
Andy Hertzfeld. Thank you.

717
00:37:26,595 --> 00:37:29,496
<I>約翰斯卡利也在這裏。</i>
<i>John Sculley is here too.</i>

718
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,466
這是很好的，他在這裏。
It's nice that he's here.

719
00:37:31,467 --> 00:37:33,801
真？ 我不認為
這是非常不錯的。
Really? I don't think
it's very nice at all.

720
00:37:33,802 --> 00:37:36,136
你必須看到他們。 他們
想瞻仰。
You have to see them. They
wanna pay their respects.

721
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:38,772
如果他們尊重，我們最好
一切還是在蘋果公司現在。
If they were respectful, we'd
all still be at Apple right now.

722
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:40,475
看...
Look...

723
00:37:40,476 --> 00:37:42,576
如果他們真的希望我好，
他們會堅持自己。
If they really wished me well,
they'd keep to themselves.

724
00:37:42,577 --> 00:37:45,112
- 我能告訴你一些事嗎？
- 我不認為他們確實希望我好。
- Can I tell you something?
- I don't think they do wish me well.

725
00:37:45,113 --> 00:37:47,581
<I>但我全部用權
那。 我在蘋果公司。</i>
<i>But I'm all right with
that. I'm over Apple.</i>

726
00:37:47,582 --> 00:37:49,817
我在Mac和沃茲和斯卡利，
I got over the Mac and Woz and Sculley,

727
00:37:49,818 --> 00:37:51,752
你得到了相同的方法
你高中時的戀人。
the same way you get over
your high school sweetheart.

728
00:37:51,753 --> 00:37:53,554
建一個新的。
Build a new one.

729
00:37:53,555 --> 00:37:55,755
- 我能告訴你一些事嗎？
- 是。
- Can I tell you something?
- Yes.

730
00:37:55,756 --> 00:37:57,558
你說你不會與他們競爭，
You said you wouldn't compete with them,

731
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:00,862
但你設計了一個計算機
專門針對教育市場，
but you designed a computer
specifically for the education market,

732
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:02,929
他們假定的自己。
which they putatively own.

733
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:06,833
所以，我認為這很酷，他們在這裏。
So, I think it's cool they're here.

734
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:09,036
他們起訴我。
They're suing me.

735
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,605
仍然。
Still.

736
00:38:10,606 --> 00:38:12,707
這是很好的，他們來了。
It was nice they came.

737
00:38:14,242 --> 00:38:16,176
他們不是坦蕩。
They're not being magnanimous.

738
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:18,179
他們希望它看起來
像一個友好的離婚。
They want it to look
like an amicable divorce.

739
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,047
歷史不會記得喬
迪馬吉奧好心傾倒瑪麗蓮。
History doesn't remember Joe
DiMaggio kindly for dumping Marilyn.

740
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,283
史蒂夫？
Steve?

741
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:25,920
你怎麼了？
What's your problem?

742
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:29,123
我不知道，但我敢肯定
這可以追溯到給你。
I don't know, but I'm sure
it can be traced back to you.

743
00:38:29,124 --> 00:38:32,792
你知道，我是一個誰
必須解釋你的人。
You know, I'm the one who
has to explain you to people.

744
00:38:32,793 --> 00:38:35,830
$ 100,000保蘭德的企業標誌
$100,000 to Paul Rand for a corporate logo

745
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:38,632
當我們甚至不知道
正是我們公司生產的。
when we didn't even know
what our company made.

746
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:42,069
A $ 65萬的模具多維數據集，
A $650,000 mold for the cube,

747
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,172
因為上帝禁止
角度是90.1，而不是90。
because God forbid the
angles be 90.1 instead of 90.

748
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:48,208
我不准的角度
是90.1，而不是90。
I forbid the angles to
be 90.1 instead of 90.

749
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:50,777
這盒可能是上
顯示在古根海姆。
That box could be on
display at the Guggenheim.

750
00:38:50,778 --> 00:38:53,013
不要給他們的理由說給新聞界
Don't give them reason to say to the press

751
00:38:53,014 --> 00:38:54,949
你有你的肩膀上的芯片。
you have a chip on your shoulder.

752
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,717
你會為我做？
Will you do that for me?

753
00:38:56,718 --> 00:38:58,319
我沒有在我的肩膀上的芯片。
I don't have a chip on my shoulder.

754
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,953
好吧好吧。
Okay, okay.

755
00:38:59,954 --> 00:39:03,658
但不給他們一個理由說你做。
But don't give them a reason to say you do.

756
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:05,159
我不。
I don't.

757
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,228
- 這是正確的態度。
- 這不是一種態度。
- That's the right attitude.
- That's not an attitude.

758
00:39:07,229 --> 00:39:09,696
他們會打電話給我回
一分鐘看光。
They're gonna call me back in
a minute to look at the light.

759
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:11,866
- 獲取一個出路。
- 精細！
- Get one out of the way.
- Fine!

760
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:15,335
- 是啊？
- 是啊。
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

761
00:39:15,336 --> 00:39:17,737
- 還有一件事。
- 當然。
- One more thing.
- Sure.

762
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:20,040
沒有問題的新聞後。
No questions from the press after.

763
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:22,275
沒有為什麼？
No... Why?

764
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,346
直到我有更好的
答案，沒有新聞無濟於事。
Until I have better
answers, no press avail.

765
00:39:25,347 --> 00:39:29,450
有人問我在哪裏，你只要
看見我，我馬上就回來。
Somebody asks where I am, you just
saw me, and I'll be right back.

766
00:39:31,218 --> 00:39:32,688
好。
Okay.

767
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,857
誰你想先？
Who do you want first?

768
00:39:36,858 --> 00:39:40,028
給我史蒂夫·沃茲尼亞克的臉。
Bring me the face of Steve Wozniak.

769
00:39:48,336 --> 00:39:51,739
不掛斷。
Hang on.

770
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,174
- 我還以為你去上學。
- 不掛斷。
- I thought you went to school.
- Hang on.

771
00:39:54,175 --> 00:39:56,911
你們應該去上學
一小時前。 我還以為你離開。
You were supposed to go to school
an hour ago. I thought you left.

772
00:39:56,912 --> 00:39:59,279
我沒有叫醒我的媽媽
在今天凌晨。
I didn't wake up my mom
on time this morning.

773
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,081
之前也它發生了。
It's happened before too.

774
00:40:01,082 --> 00:40:05,152
我醒來報警，然後
我穿好衣服，吃早餐，
I wake up with the alarm and then
I get dressed and eat breakfast,

775
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,821
但有時我忘了看
這是什麼時候在那之後。
but sometimes I forget to see
what time it is after that.

776
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,690
- 為什麼沒有你媽媽剛剛成立了自己的鬧鐘？
- 這是我的家務事之一。
- Why doesn't your mom just set her own alarm clock?
- It's one of my chores.

777
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:13,893
我不明白，有
做，為什麼你還是...
I don't understand what that has
to do with why you're still...

778
00:40:13,894 --> 00:40:15,196
哪裏是你的母親呢？
Where's your mother?

779
00:40:15,197 --> 00:40:17,297
<I>她去找到一個公用電話。</i>
<i>She went to find a pay phone.</i>

780
00:40:17,298 --> 00:40:19,199
一個小時前，她說...
An hour ago, she said...

781
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,034
你沒有舉手。
You don't have to raise your hand.

782
00:40:21,035 --> 00:40:23,804
- 你說，這是關閉的一點點。
- 它是。
- You said it was off by a little.
- It is.

783
00:40:23,805 --> 00:40:25,806
- 我只是衡量它。
- 喬安娜...
- I just measured it.
- Joanna...

784
00:40:25,807 --> 00:40:27,775
四面整整一英尺。
Exactly a foot on all four sides.

785
00:40:27,776 --> 00:40:29,310
有六個側面。
There are six sides.

786
00:40:29,311 --> 00:40:31,411
但你不應該
在這裏現在。
But you're not supposed
to be here right now.

787
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:34,681
我們知道，如果四個邊
是彼此相等，
We know if four of the sides
are equal to each other,

788
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,085
其他兩個必須相等。
the other two must be equal as well.

789
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,388
在上，下，左，右
The top, bottom, right and left

790
00:40:40,389 --> 00:40:42,757
大約一毫米短
比的正面和背面。
are about a millimeter shorter
than the front and back.

791
00:40:42,758 --> 00:40:44,257
他們不是。 我衡量他們。
They're not. I measured them.

792
00:40:44,258 --> 00:40:46,793
麗莎，我是那種在設計方面的專家。
Lisa, I'm kind of an expert in design.

793
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:49,897
這是一個20美分的統治者。 您認為
有一個機會，它可能會關閉？
And that's a 20-cent ruler. You think
there's a chance it could be off?

794
00:40:49,898 --> 00:40:53,433
如果我有另外的尺子，我會衡量
這把尺子，但我真的懷疑它的關閉。
If I had another ruler, I would measure
this ruler, but I really doubt it's off.

795
00:40:53,434 --> 00:40:57,337
- 當你的媽媽回來，你必須去上學。
- 因為它是一個統治者！
- When your mother comes back, you have to go to school.
- Because it's a ruler!

796
00:40:57,338 --> 00:40:58,973
為什麼關閉？
Why is it off?

797
00:40:58,974 --> 00:41:00,308
- 你聽到我剛才說的嗎？
- 是。
- Did you hear what I just said?
- Yes.

798
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:02,877
因為有時它似乎像
你剛才一直說你想要什麼
Because sometimes it seems like
you just keep saying what you want

799
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:04,880
不聽。
without listening.

800
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:13,154
我在聽。
I'm listening.

801
00:41:13,155 --> 00:41:16,492
- 是否有您所需要的？
- 沒有。
- Is there something you need?
- No.

802
00:41:19,461 --> 00:41:21,094
為什麼不是一個完美的立方體？
Why isn't it a perfect cube?

803
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:23,731
- 你以前問過我。
- 我忘了是什麼了。
- You've asked me before.
- I forget what it is.

804
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:26,567
這是一個光學異常。
It's an optical anomaly.

805
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:29,837
對人眼來說，一個完美的
立方體看起來並不像一個魔方，
To the human eye, a perfect
cube doesn't look like a cube,

806
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:32,373
所以我們把它大約一毫米
比在兩側腳短。
so we made it roughly a millimeter
shorter than a foot on two sides.

807
00:41:32,374 --> 00:41:33,940
什麼是異常？
What's an anomaly?

808
00:41:33,941 --> 00:41:35,810
你問我之前太。
You've asked me that before too.

809
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:38,412
我不知道為什麼你繼續這樣做。
I don't know why you keep doing that.

810
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:43,150
這是一個例外。 某物
不適合的模式。
It's an exception. Something
that doesn't fit a pattern.

811
00:41:44,285 --> 00:41:46,353
你必須去上學。 進來！
You have to go to school. Come in!

812
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:50,324
我覺得你們兩個已經滿足。
I think you two have met.

813
00:41:50,325 --> 00:41:51,958
你好，老朋友。
Hello, old friend.

814
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:55,029
- 你看起來很好。
- 你也是。 你也是。
- You look well.
- So do you. So do you.

815
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:58,998
他們告訴我喬治
準備好你看看焦點。
And they're telling me George is
ready for you to look at the focus.

816
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:00,500
就拿跟我走。
Take a walk with me.

817
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:02,103
- 這是麗莎？
- 是啊。
- Is this Lisa?
- Yeah.

818
00:42:02,104 --> 00:42:04,004
- 這不可能是麗莎。
- 它是。
- This can't be Lisa.
- It is.

819
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:06,005
- 麗莎的這個大。
- 他們得到更高。 加油。
- Lisa's this big.
- They get taller. Come on.

820
00:42:06,006 --> 00:42:07,908
- 你記得我嗎？
- 她不。
- Do you remember me?
- She doesn't.

821
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:09,877
我是你爸爸的朋友史蒂夫·沃茲尼亞克。
I'm your dad's friend Steve Wozniak.

822
00:42:09,878 --> 00:42:14,047
對不起。 我不記得你。
I apologize. I don't remember you.

823
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:15,415
你很有禮貌。
You're very polite.

824
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:17,118
- 沃茲？
- 是啊。
- Woz?
- Yeah.

825
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,953
Chrisann是在現收現付
電話。 你會找到她？
Chrisann's at a pay
phone. Would you find her?

826
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:20,020
是啊。
Yeah.

827
00:42:20,021 --> 00:42:21,788
<I>好熱鬧。</i>
<i>Good turnout.</i>

828
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,223
- 偉大的投票率。
- 是啊。
- Great turnout.
- Yeah.

829
00:42:23,224 --> 00:42:26,159
- 「瘋狂太棒了。」
- 瘋狂大。
- "Insanely great."
- Insanely great.

830
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,462
這是我們第一次
沒玩過的同一支球隊。
This is the first time we
haven't played for the same team.

831
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:31,031
這就像你正在釋放
你的第一張個人專輯。
It's like you're releasing
your first solo album.

832
00:42:31,032 --> 00:42:33,967
我，呃...我很欣賞你
邀請我到發射。
I, uh... I appreciate your
inviting me to the launch.

833
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,469
我只是想徹底清除。
I just want to wipe the slate clean.

834
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,105
這正是我想要的。
這就是為什麼我來到後台。
That's exactly what I want.
That's why I came backstage.

835
00:42:38,106 --> 00:42:40,841
我想讓你知道，嗯，
我會在那裏和你在一起。
I want you to know, um,
I'll be out there with you.

836
00:42:40,842 --> 00:42:43,210
任何機會，我可以讓你
代替我去了那裏？
Any chance I can get you to
go out there instead of me?

837
00:42:43,211 --> 00:42:45,011
我愛你，史蒂夫。
I love you, Steve.

838
00:42:45,012 --> 00:42:46,446
我也愛你，沃茲。
I love you too, Woz.

839
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:49,415
你知道，說了一些事情。
You know, some things were said.

840
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:51,384
他們是。 他們在公眾中說。
They were. They were said in public.

841
00:42:51,385 --> 00:42:54,455
他們出版。 被
你被迫做呢？
They were published. Were
you pressured to do it?

842
00:42:54,456 --> 00:42:56,322
當時我是什麼？
Was I what?

843
00:42:56,323 --> 00:43:02,062
一探究竟。 這是樂團
坑舊金山歌劇院。
Check it out. It's the orchestra
pit for the San Francisco Opera.

844
00:43:02,063 --> 00:43:04,330
當時我被迫做呢？
Was I pressured to do it?

845
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:07,433
我曾經遇到小澤征爾在坦格烏德。
I once met Seiji Ozawa at Tanglewood.

846
00:43:07,434 --> 00:43:09,870
雷鳴般的指揮。
A thunderous conductor.

847
00:43:09,871 --> 00:43:11,971
不敬虔的藝術性和細微之處。
Ungodly artfulness and nuance.

848
00:43:11,972 --> 00:43:16,543
我問他到底什麼一個
導體做一個節拍器不能。
And I asked him what exactly a
conductor does that a metronome can't.

849
00:43:16,544 --> 00:43:19,313
- 令人驚訝的，他......
- 他沒有打活狗屎嗎？
- Surprisingly, he...
- He didn't beat the living shit out of you?

850
00:43:19,314 --> 00:43:23,917
那就對了。 不，他說，「
音樂家們演奏著樂器。「
That's right. No, he said, "The
musicians play their instruments."

851
00:43:23,918 --> 00:43:25,819
我玩樂團。「
I play the orchestra."

852
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,056
這感覺就像一些聽起來
不錯，但並不意味著什麼。
That feels like something that sounds
good, but doesn't mean anything.

853
00:43:29,057 --> 00:43:33,194
馬庫拉，斯卡利......難道他們問
你去渣我關在報刊上？
Markkula, Sculley... Did they ask
you to slag me off in the press?

854
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:35,228
我有理由生氣。
I had reason to be angry.

855
00:43:35,229 --> 00:43:36,964
- 難道不是嗎？
- 絕對不。
- Did they?
- Absolutely not.

856
00:43:36,965 --> 00:43:38,399
但是，他們問你談談。
But they asked you to talk.

857
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,201
蘋果被圍困。
你剛剛離開了公司。
Apple was under siege.
You'd just left the company.

858
00:43:40,202 --> 00:43:41,935
必須有人交談的記者。
Someone had to talk to the press.

859
00:43:41,936 --> 00:43:45,371
我就在這裏，沃茲。 公司留給我。
I'm right here, Woz. The company left me.

860
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:48,042
我懇求你。 我懇求你。
I begged you. I begged you.

861
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,243
蘋果II占
為收入的70％。
The Apple II accounted
for 70% of the revenue.

862
00:43:50,244 --> 00:43:52,846
你認為什麼是要發生的事？
What did you think was gonna happen?

863
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:56,217
你根本不夠關心
蘋果II或麗莎。
You didn't care enough about
the Apple II or the Lisa.

864
00:43:56,218 --> 00:43:57,851
讓我們真正清楚。
Let's be really clear.

865
00:43:57,852 --> 00:44:00,755
我不關心的所有關於
蘋果II或麗莎。
I didn't care at all about
the Apple II or the Lisa.

866
00:44:02,122 --> 00:44:04,357
我不是被迫這樣做。
I wasn't pressured to do it.

867
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:10,897
我向新聞界說的是一個誠實的，
如果磨礪，是我認為反映。
What I said to the press was an honest,
if tempered, reflection of what I believed.

868
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,933
- 沃茲。
- 是啊？
- Woz.
- Yeah?

869
00:44:12,934 --> 00:44:15,335
什麼他媽的是你的手腕？
What the fuck is on your wrist?

870
00:44:15,336 --> 00:44:18,505
- 你想知道嗎？
- 我簡直等不及了。
- You wanna know?
- I literally can't wait.

871
00:44:18,506 --> 00:44:20,607
每個人的會是
10年來穿這些。
Everyone's gonna be
wearing these in 10 years.

872
00:44:20,608 --> 00:44:23,009
這是一個尿血的手錶，用做數碼管。
It's a Nixie watch, made using Nixie tubes.

873
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:25,379
這實際上是
40歲的技術。
This is actually
40-year-old technology.

874
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,315
冷陰極管。 他們是
工作在140伏。
Cold cathode tubes. They're
operating at 140 volts.

875
00:44:28,316 --> 00:44:30,317
我傾斜我的手腕45
度，它就在那裏。
I tilt my wrist 45
degrees, it's right there.

876
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:32,085
時，分，秒。
Hours, minutes and seconds.

877
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,520
我們的思想工作的方式。 看那個。
The way our minds work. Look at that.

878
00:44:34,521 --> 00:44:37,123
幫我一個忙。 將手錶
未來就像你在飛機上
Do me a favor. Set the watch
ahead like you're on a plane

879
00:44:37,124 --> 00:44:38,592
而只是改變時區。
and just changed time zones.

880
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,360
不是一個問題。
Not a problem.

881
00:44:40,361 --> 00:44:44,899
擰開了。 只要按下按鈕。
Unscrew that. Just hit the button.

882
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:49,435
打擾一下。 空姐？ 該男子下一個
對我來說似乎是引爆了​​炸彈。
Excuse me. Flight attendant? The man next
to me would appear to be detonating a bomb.

883
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,404
你覺得這看起來像一個炸彈。
You think this looks like a bomb.

884
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:54,342
即使是現在，我不是100％肯定它不是。
Even right now, I'm not 100% sure it isn't.

885
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:58,814
- 我想，也許一旦人們習慣了它...
- 沒有。
- I think maybe once people get used to it...
- No.

886
00:45:03,584 --> 00:45:06,654
我生氣了。
I was angry.

887
00:45:06,655 --> 00:45:09,489
你剛才說有關Apple II的事情，
和你的方式進行治療團隊...
You were saying things about the Apple II,
and the way you were treating the team...

888
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:13,192
沃茲。 你得到的免費券生活。
Woz. You get a free pass for life.

889
00:45:13,193 --> 00:45:16,630
我得回去舞台。 我們有
兩分鐘排練時間離開了。
I got to get back onstage. We got
two minutes of rehearsal time left.

890
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:20,601
你瞭解居高臨下
剛才是？ 也許你不知道。
Do you understand how condescending
that just was? Maybe you don't.

891
00:45:20,602 --> 00:45:23,203
我不希望看到你得到拖累
關閉塑料手銬飛機。
I don't want to see you get dragged
off an airplane in plastic handcuffs.

892
00:45:23,204 --> 00:45:26,473
我得到一個免費通行證，從您的生活嗎？
I get a free pass for life from you?

893
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:29,542
你給了通...
Y-Y-您給我吧？
You give out the pass...
Y-Y-You give them to me?

894
00:45:29,543 --> 00:45:31,344
你要去有中風，小傢伙。
You're gonna have a stroke, little buddy.

895
00:45:31,345 --> 00:45:34,849
你做了什麼？ 你做了什麼？
What did you do? What did you do?

896
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:38,252
為什麼麗莎沒有聽說過我？
Why has Lisa not heard of me?

897
00:45:38,253 --> 00:45:41,721
媽的，男人，多少
四年級學生聽說過嗎？
Shit, man, how many
fourth-graders have heard of you?

898
00:45:41,722 --> 00:45:46,092
你可以不寫代碼。 你不是
一個工程師。 你不是一個設計師。
You can't write code. You're not
an engineer. You're not a designer.

899
00:45:46,093 --> 00:45:48,328
你不能把錘子釘子。
You can't put a hammer to a nail.

900
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,964
我建了電路板。
I built the circuit board.

901
00:45:49,965 --> 00:45:52,433
圖形界面
從Xerox PARC的被偷了。
The graphical interface
was stolen from Xerox PARC.

902
00:45:52,434 --> 00:45:56,170
傑夫·拉斯金是在Mac團隊的領導者
你扔在他面前脫下自己的項目。
Jef Raskin was the leader of the Mac team
before you threw him off his own project.

903
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:59,373
一切......有人
其他設計中。
Everything... Someone
else designed the box.

904
00:45:59,374 --> 00:46:01,308
那麼怎麼來的10次在一天，
So how come 10 times in a day,

905
00:46:01,309 --> 00:46:05,112
我讀「史蒂夫·喬布斯是個天才」？
I read "Steve Jobs is a genius"?

906
00:46:05,113 --> 00:46:06,980
你是做什麼？
What do you do?

907
00:46:06,981 --> 00:46:08,649
我玩樂團。
I play the orchestra.

908
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:10,683
而你是一個優秀的音樂家。
你坐在那裏。
And you're a good musician.
You sit right there.

909
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,719
你最好在你行的。
You're the best in your row.

910
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,054
我來這裏是為了清除空氣中。
I came here to clear the air.

911
00:46:15,055 --> 00:46:17,491
- 你知道我為什麼來這裏？
- 你剛才不是回答這個問題？
- Do you know why I came here?
- Didn't you just answer that?

912
00:46:17,492 --> 00:46:20,326
我來到這裏是因為
你會被殺。
I came here because
you're gonna get killed.

913
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:23,330
您的計算機會失敗。
Your computer's gonna fail.

914
00:46:23,331 --> 00:46:25,766
你有一個大學，
大學顧問委員會
You had a college and
university advisory board

915
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:28,735
告訴你他們需要一個功能強大
工作站2000到3000。
telling you they need a powerful
workstation for 2,000 to 3,000.

916
00:46:28,736 --> 00:46:31,005
你在6500價位的下一步。
You've priced NeXT at 6,500.

917
00:46:31,006 --> 00:46:33,540
並且不包括
可選的$ 3000名硬盤，
And that doesn't include the
optional $3,000 hard drive,

918
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:36,243
人們會發現是不可選的。
which people will discover isn't optional.

919
00:46:36,244 --> 00:46:39,279
因為光盤
是太弱，無法做任何事情。
Because the optical disk
is too weak to do anything.

920
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,417
而$ 2,500激光打印機
共計為$ 12,000元。
And the $2,500 laser printer
brings the total to $12,000.

921
00:46:43,418 --> 00:46:45,518
而且在整個世界，
你是唯一的人
And in the entire world,
you are the only person

922
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:48,321
誰在乎它的
住在一個完美的立方體。
who cares that it's
housed in a perfect cube.

923
00:46:48,322 --> 00:46:50,524
你會被殺死。
You're gonna get killed.

924
00:46:50,525 --> 00:46:53,159
我來到這裏站在
你旁邊，而出現這種情況
And I came here to stand
next to you while that happens

925
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,161
因為這就是朋友們。
because that's what friends do.

926
00:46:55,162 --> 00:47:00,034
這就是男人。 我不需要你的密碼。
That's what men do. I don't need your pass.

927
00:47:00,035 --> 00:47:02,469
我們回去，所以不說話
對我來說，我是其他人。
We go back, so don't talk
to me like I'm other people.

928
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:04,705
我就是知道只有一個
I'm the only one that knows

929
00:47:04,706 --> 00:47:07,708
這傢伙在這裏是一個你發明的。
that this guy here is someone you invented.

930
00:47:07,709 --> 00:47:12,478
我站在你，因為那
完美的立方體，什麼也不做
I'm standing by you because that
perfect cube that does nothing

931
00:47:12,479 --> 00:47:15,181
即將成為最大的單一故障
is about to be the single biggest failure

932
00:47:15,182 --> 00:47:17,952
在個人計算機的歷史。
in the history of personal computing.

933
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:22,690
告訴我什麼我不知道。
Tell me something else I don't know.

934
00:47:28,195 --> 00:47:29,797
- 回到舞台上？
- 我們沒時間了。
- Back onstage?
- We're out of time.

935
00:47:29,798 --> 00:47:33,500
他們得拖
舞台，然後打開房子。
They've got to mop the
stage and open the house.

936
00:47:33,501 --> 00:47:37,203
如果它崩潰，崩潰，對不對？
If it crashes, it crashes, right?

937
00:47:37,204 --> 00:47:38,739
你會是個笑話。
You'll make a joke.

938
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,339
我會成為一個笑話。
I'll make a joke.

939
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,775
如果它崩潰，崩潰。
If it crashes, it crashes.

940
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:46,446
這是一個很好的口號。 「下一個。
如果它崩潰，崩潰「。
It's a good slogan. "NeXT.
If it crashes, it crashes."

941
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,614
我不只是在談論演示，史蒂夫。
I'm not just talking about the demo, Steve.

942
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:51,085
如果坦克，我們不吞下氰化物。
If it tanks, we don't swallow cyanide.

943
00:47:51,086 --> 00:47:53,853
- 我們回到繪圖板。
- 沒有更多的繪圖板。
- We go back to the drawing board.
- No more drawing boards.

944
00:47:53,854 --> 00:47:56,422
發明了埃茲爾兩次，你
沒有得到任何更多的繪圖板。
Invent the Edsel twice, you
don't get any more drawing boards.

945
00:47:56,423 --> 00:47:57,857
告訴我的計劃是什麼。
Tell me what the plan is.

946
00:47:57,858 --> 00:48:00,259
你要告訴我
計劃，因為我不知道。
You have to tell me the
plan, because I don't know.

947
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:04,098
你走動像
你有「不能輸」的卡。
You're walking around like
you've got "Can't Lose" cards.

948
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:08,134
該計劃將揭示自己
當你準備好你看到它。
The plan will reveal itself to
you when you're ready to see it.

949
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,603
請問我要降酸？
Will I have to drop acid?

950
00:48:10,604 --> 00:48:12,172
不能傷害。
Couldn't hurt.

951
00:48:12,173 --> 00:48:13,540
是否有計劃？
Is there a plan?

952
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:15,375
難道我讓你失望？
Have I ever let you down?

953
00:48:15,376 --> 00:48:17,243
每一個該死的時間。
Every single goddamn time.

954
00:48:17,244 --> 00:48:19,212
- 然後我所致。
- 在那兒？
- Then I'm due.
- Is there?

955
00:48:19,213 --> 00:48:21,214
喬安娜，有一個計劃。
Joanna, there's a plan.

956
00:48:21,215 --> 00:48:24,784
我只是不想讓你在
在那裏你說謊的人的位置。
I just don't wanna put you in a
position where you're lying to people.

957
00:48:26,688 --> 00:48:30,190
開始遲到15分鐘，以便Avie將能
重新編譯，給我們一個戰鬥的機會。
Start 15 minutes late so Avie can
recompile and give us a fighting chance.

958
00:48:30,191 --> 00:48:32,493
耶穌基督。 多少次
我們要怎麼有這樣的騙子？
Jesus Christ. How many times
are we gonna have this con...

959
00:48:32,494 --> 00:48:34,393
- 我們沒有起步較晚，永遠！
- 精細！
- We're not starting late, ever!
- Fine!

960
00:48:34,394 --> 00:48:37,498
- 我們不是永遠起步較晚。
- 晚了。
- We're not ever starting late.
- Late.

961
00:48:37,499 --> 00:48:41,069
但是，在你來
倒在起步晚？
But where do you come
down on starting late?

962
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:53,614
麗莎一直在做這件事情，她
問我的東西，我已經告訴她了。
Lisa's been doing this thing where she
asks me about stuff I've already told her.

963
00:48:53,615 --> 00:48:56,283
她問我問題，我知道
她已經知道答案。
She asks me questions, and I know
she already knows the answers.

964
00:48:56,284 --> 00:48:57,717
那是什麼呢？
What's that about?

965
00:48:57,718 --> 00:49:01,855
孩子們做到這一點時，他們嚇壞了1
他們的父母是心情不好。
Kids do that when they're scared one
of their parents is in a bad mood.

966
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:05,424
他們試圖讓你說話
對自己喜歡的東西。
They try to get you talking
about something you like.

967
00:49:05,425 --> 00:49:10,696
這是很常見的，並且可以通過被處理
跟她的事，她喜歡。
It's very common and can be treated by
talking to her about things she likes.

968
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:15,234
你有什麼經驗
或培訓在這個領域？
Do you have any experience
or training in this field?

969
00:49:15,235 --> 00:49:16,435
沒有。
No.

970
00:49:16,436 --> 00:49:19,073
告訴他們打開房子。
Tell them to open the house.

971
00:49:25,613 --> 00:49:29,084
- 是麗莎在哪裏？
- 她的身邊。
- Where's Lisa?
- She's around.

972
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:33,853
- 這意味著什麼？
- 她周圍的建築物運行。
- What does that mean?
- She's running around the building.

973
00:49:33,854 --> 00:49:36,455
一個小時前，你說你
被帶她上學。
An hour ago, you said you
were taking her to school.

974
00:49:36,456 --> 00:49:39,726
她求我讓她留下來。 那裏
是誰的父親會這麼愛...
She begged me to let her stay. There
are fathers who would so love...

975
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:44,263
這是錯誤的，好嗎？ 這在道德上是
錯了，這是錯誤的腸胃。
It is wrong, okay? It is morally
wrong, it's parentally wrong.

976
00:49:44,264 --> 00:49:47,500
這是錯誤的，你用麗莎
從我財路的方式。
It is wrong for you to use Lisa
as a way of getting money from me.

977
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:50,469
她知道，如果她不已經，
這是她的主要用途。
She will know, if she doesn't already,
that that is your primary use for her.

978
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:52,638
她會恨你
你的餘生。
She will hate you for
the rest of your life.

979
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,442
她會看，如果她已經不，那
她的母親是一個女人誰站起來的人。
She will see, if she doesn't already, that
her mother is a woman who stands up to men.

980
00:49:56,443 --> 00:49:58,277
活過他們。
By living off of them.

981
00:49:58,278 --> 00:50:01,214
由於沒有讓自己變得
監禁，他們降級。
By not letting myself be
imprisoned and degraded by them.

982
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:06,652
囚禁？ 我不能擺脫你。
Imprisoned? I can't get rid of you.

983
00:50:06,653 --> 00:50:09,422
我需要一個醫生，我需要一個牙醫。
I need a doctor and I need a dentist.

984
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:12,525
我從大學輟學後，
學期，不過，沒關係，讓我們一起來看看。
I dropped out of college after a
semester, but, okay, let's have a look.

985
00:50:12,526 --> 00:50:14,860
你會支持你
女兒和她的母親。
You will support your
daughter and her mother.

986
00:50:14,861 --> 00:50:17,397
你有沒有僱人
$ 1,500到保佑你的房子？
Did you pay someone
$1,500 to bless your house?

987
00:50:17,398 --> 00:50:19,799
- 你聽到我說的嗎？
- 你是否？
- Did you hear what I said?
- Did you?

988
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,768
我不記得有多少了，史蒂夫。
I don't remember how much it was, Steve.

989
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:24,471
- 這是$ 1500元。
- 那麼，他們不這樣做免費的。
- It was $1,500.
- Well, they don't do it for free.

990
00:50:24,472 --> 00:50:26,005
他們不知道。 他們收取$ 1500元。
They don't. They charge $1,500.

991
00:50:26,006 --> 00:50:28,942
我如何度過......他媽的。 您
知道了，我甚至會...
How I spend... Fuck. You
know, I'm not even gonna...

992
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:32,645
是你約說，「我怎麼花
我的錢是你管得著嗎「的？
Were you about to say, "How I spend
my money is none of your business"?

993
00:50:32,646 --> 00:50:35,915
我有一個鼻竇感染，
我要去看牙醫了。
I have a sinus infection and
I need to see a dentist too.

994
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:38,618
所以，你可以看到你的祝福
預算本來可以更好地用。
So you can see how your blessing
budget could have been better spent.

995
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:41,689
喜歡上一個完美的立方體？
Like on a perfect cube?

996
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:45,259
- 看看我，Chrisann。
- 什麼？
- Look at me, Chrisann.
- What?

997
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,326
- 你知道我是誰了吧？
- 是。
- You know who I am, right?
- Yes.

998
00:50:47,327 --> 00:50:49,696
- 你知道我認識的人。
- 你在說什麼？
- And you know I know people.
- What are you talking about?

999
00:50:49,697 --> 00:50:53,533
看著我。 你知道的
我認識的人，他們知道的人。
Look at me. And you know the
people I know, they know people.

1000
00:50:53,534 --> 00:50:54,935
這是什麼？
What is this?

1001
00:50:54,936 --> 00:50:58,571
如果我以後再，你已經聽到
泛起了一碗麥片在麗莎的頭...
If I ever hear again that you've
thrown a cereal bowl at Lisa's head...

1002
00:50:58,572 --> 00:51:00,774
- 什麼？
- 我的專用線的要響，
- What?
- My private line's gonna ring,

1003
00:51:00,775 --> 00:51:03,743
而在另一端的聲音
是會說，「我們所有的設置。」
and a voice on the other end
is gonna say, "We're all set."

1004
00:51:03,744 --> 00:51:06,013
- 這就是我要學習，你就死定了。
- 你CRA ...
- That's how I'll learn that you're dead.
- Are you cra...

1005
00:51:06,014 --> 00:51:08,281
我扔在地上的碗。
I threw the bowl on the floor.

1006
00:51:08,282 --> 00:51:09,815
我沒有在她的頭上扔。
I didn't throw it at her head.

1007
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,618
她甚至沒有在房間裏。
She wasn't even in the room.

1008
00:51:11,619 --> 00:51:14,554
她無處...我扔
碗在地板上。
She was nowhere... I threw
the bowl on the floor.

1009
00:51:14,555 --> 00:51:17,658
她是一個小女孩。 你嚇著她。
She's a little girl. You're scaring her.

1010
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:20,359
我是一個成年男子。 你嚇到我了。
I'm a grown man. You're scaring me.

1011
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,562
清除垃圾是件苦差事。
Taking out the garbage is a chore.

1012
00:51:22,563 --> 00:51:24,630
收拾桌子是件苦差事。
Clearing the table is a chore.

1013
00:51:24,631 --> 00:51:27,301
喚醒你早上起來
只是他媽的讓人毛骨悚然。
Waking you up in the morning
is just fucking creepy.

1014
00:51:27,302 --> 00:51:30,304
- 請告訴我更多關於為人父母。
- 我們都在這裏完成。
- Please teach me more about being a parent.
- We're all done here.

1015
00:51:30,305 --> 00:51:33,607
這意味著很多來自何處
人誰也不會承認自己就是其中之一。
It means so much coming from
someone who won't admit he is one.

1016
00:51:33,608 --> 00:51:35,609
- 停止尖叫麗莎。
- 我給她的責任。
- Stop screaming at Lisa.
- I give her responsibilities.

1017
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:37,743
- 得到它了。
- 有一天，她會感謝我的。
- Got it.
- One day she's gonna thank me for it.

1018
00:51:37,744 --> 00:51:39,712
- 也許在你睡覺的。
- 滾開！
- Probably in your sleep.
- Fuck off!

1019
00:51:39,713 --> 00:51:40,681
好。
Okay.

1020
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:43,482
我從來沒有...我從來不扔
什麼在她的頭上。
I never... I never threw
anything at her head.

1021
00:51:43,483 --> 00:51:45,886
史蒂夫。
Steve.

1022
00:51:45,887 --> 00:51:48,721
我永遠不會。
I never would.

1023
00:51:48,722 --> 00:51:53,227
事情不是變得如此，因為你這麼說。
Things don't become so because you say so.

1024
00:51:54,461 --> 00:51:58,065
未來將有更多的錢在你的
帳戶由業務結束。
There'll be more money in your
account by the end of business.

1025
00:52:06,474 --> 00:52:09,144
- 是你是漂亮的？
- 哦耶。
- Were you being nice?
- Oh, yeah.

1026
00:52:14,849 --> 00:52:18,484
- 安迪的旁邊。
- 赫茨菲爾德或坎寧安？
- Andy's next.
- Hertzfeld or Cunningham?

1027
00:52:18,485 --> 00:52:23,190
赫茨菲爾德。 他玩Avie將
Tevanian在計算機後台上。
Hertzfeld. He's playing with Avie
Tevanian on the computer backstage.

1028
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:29,264
女士們先生們，
房子現在是開放的。
Ladies and gentlemen,
the house is now open.

1029
00:52:43,778 --> 00:52:48,013
- 玩在數千人面前。
- 史蒂夫！
- Playing in front of thousands of people.
- Steve!

1030
00:52:48,014 --> 00:52:50,917
他後來能做到這一點，喬爾？
我們走在8分鐘。
Can he do it later, Joel?
We go in eight minutes.

1031
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:53,552
- 我可以得到一個快速的反應，記者今天上午？
- 怎麼了？
- Can I get a quick reaction to the press this morning?
- What about it?

1032
00:52:53,553 --> 00:52:56,056
- 它的大小，體積。
- 我會告訴你的背景？
- The size of it, the volume.
- I'll tell you on background...

1033
00:52:56,057 --> 00:52:58,458
- 我希望從史蒂夫報價。
- 我會告訴你的背景
- I was hoping for a quote from Steve.
- I'll tell you on background

1034
00:52:58,459 --> 00:53:01,060
我從未見過任何東西
喜歡它的高科技產業。
that I've never seen anything
like it in the tech industry.

1035
00:53:01,061 --> 00:53:04,063
我叫<I>​​華爾街日報</i>
拿出一個整版廣告的今天，
I called the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
to take out a full-page ad for today,

1036
00:53:04,064 --> 00:53:06,400
而你知道他們的銷售員說的嗎？
and do you know what their sales guy said?

1037
00:53:06,401 --> 00:53:10,804
「何必呢？它會像通知
梅西明天是聖誕節。「
"Why bother? It'd be like notifying
Macy's that tomorrow is Christmas."

1038
00:53:10,805 --> 00:53:12,873
- 你看到了斯圖爾特·艾爾索普通訊？
- 我做到了。
- You saw the Stewart Alsop newsletter?
- I did.

1039
00:53:12,874 --> 00:53:15,107
對不起，喬安娜，我需要
讓史蒂夫的紀錄。
I'm sorry, Joanna, I need
to get Steve on the record.

1040
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:19,612
該標題是「親愛的NeXT公司，
我什麼時候能拿到我的機器？「
The headline was "Dear NeXT,
when can I get my machine?"

1041
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:23,683
- 當是嗎？
- 我們將宣佈出貨日期在未來8到10周。
- When can he?
- We'll announce the ship date in the next eight to 10 weeks.

1042
00:53:23,684 --> 00:53:25,085
艾爾索普不是談論的發貨日期。
Alsop's not talking about the ship date.

1043
00:53:25,086 --> 00:53:27,754
他想知道他什麼時候
可以得到一個一起玩。
He wants to know when he
can get one to play with.

1044
00:53:27,755 --> 00:53:29,855
我們有很多尊重斯圖爾特·艾爾索普，
We have a lot of respect for Stewart Alsop,

1045
00:53:29,856 --> 00:53:33,692
我們希望得到一台機器到他的手
這樣他就可以告訴他的訂戶了。
and we want to get a machine into his hands
so he can tell his subscribers about it.

1046
00:53:33,693 --> 00:53:36,429
- 而當將有多大呢？
- 很快。
- And when will that be?
- Very soon.

1047
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:39,098
幾天？ 一周？
Couple of days? A week?

1048
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:41,801
關閉記錄。
Off the record.

1049
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:44,170
- 關閉記錄？
- 完全。
- Off the record?
- Completely.

1050
00:53:44,171 --> 00:53:47,507
- 我們認為...
- 他會得到它時，它的完成。
- We think...
- He'll get it when it's finished.

1051
00:53:47,508 --> 00:53:49,109
這還不算完？
It's not finished?

1052
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,411
它幾乎已經完成。
It's almost finished.

1053
00:53:50,412 --> 00:53:53,513
- 我一直在看你排練演示了三個星期。
- 是啊。
- I've been watching you rehearse the demo for three weeks.
- Yeah.

1054
00:53:53,514 --> 00:53:54,947
- 還剩下什麼？
- 一個小東西。
- What's left?
- A little thing.

1055
00:53:54,948 --> 00:53:56,415
- 什麼？
- 我認為這是不夠的。
- What?
- I think that's enough.

1056
00:53:56,416 --> 00:53:59,786
我們關閉記錄，和喬爾總是
一直善於理解細微之處。
We're off the record, and Joel's always
been good at understanding nuance.

1057
00:53:59,787 --> 00:54:02,022
什麼是留下來完成？
What's left to finish?

1058
00:54:02,023 --> 00:54:06,260
我想，在通俗地說，你會
不得不說，我們沒有一個操作系統。
I guess, in layman's terms, you'd
have to say we don't have an OS.

1059
00:54:08,896 --> 00:54:11,499
- 一個操作系統？
- 是啊。
- An operating system?
- Yeah.

1060
00:54:12,733 --> 00:54:16,536
- 什麼意思？
- 嗯，操作系統是運行在計算機上。
- What do you mean?
- Well, the OS is what runs the computer.

1061
00:54:16,537 --> 00:54:18,471
事實上，它的排序是計算機。
In fact, it sort of is the computer.

1062
00:54:18,472 --> 00:54:20,774
它是如何一直運行？ 怎麼樣
它會運行今天早上？
How has it been running? How's
it gonna run this morning?

1063
00:54:20,775 --> 00:54:23,143
你是什​​麼意思，你沒有一個操作系統？
What do you mean, you don't have an OS?

1064
00:54:23,144 --> 00:54:26,679
是這樣的。 阿瓦德斯·特凡尼安
是我們的首席軟體設計師，
It's like this. Avie Tevanian
is our chief software designer,

1065
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,947
他寫了一個演示程序。
and he wrote a demo program.

1066
00:54:27,948 --> 00:54:31,484
這就像我們建立了一個偉大的汽車，
但我們還沒有建立發動機。
It's like we built a great car,
but we haven't built the engine.

1067
00:54:31,485 --> 00:54:34,154
所以我們把高爾夫球車電池
在那裏，使他走了一會兒。
So we put a golf cart battery
in there to make it go for a bit.

1068
00:54:34,155 --> 00:54:37,022
所有這些計算機知道該怎麼辦
現在的問題是證明自己。
All this computer knows how to do
right now is demonstrate itself.

1069
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:39,525
你告訴我的唯一
你已經建立了一個黑色的魔方？
You're telling me the only thing
you've built is a black cube?

1070
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,495
是。 是啊。
Yes. Yeah.

1071
00:54:41,496 --> 00:54:43,663
但是，是不是最酷
你見過黑色的魔方？
But isn't it the coolest
black cube you've ever seen?

1072
00:54:43,664 --> 00:54:45,165
這是...我們關閉記錄。
Is this... We're off the record.

1073
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:47,734
這是一個策略或
問題？ 如果這是一個問題......
Is this a strategy or a
problem? If it's a problem...

1074
00:54:47,735 --> 00:54:51,737
不共享專有
知識與那個人。
Do not share proprietary
knowledge with that man.

1075
00:54:51,738 --> 00:54:53,906
這不是一個問題。
It's not a problem.

1076
00:54:53,907 --> 00:54:55,674
我想不明白也無妨。
I wouldn't understand it anyway.

1077
00:54:55,675 --> 00:54:58,612
我不明白，要麼，
我的名字是對的專利。
I don't understand it either,
and my name's on the patents.

1078
00:54:58,613 --> 00:55:01,882
- 它有電子郵件。
- 嗯，電子郵件的不只是技術專家了。
- It's got e-mail.
- Well, e-mail's not just for tech specialists anymore.

1079
00:55:01,883 --> 00:55:03,583
那麼，它是，但它不會。
Well, it is, but it won't be.

1080
00:55:03,584 --> 00:55:08,522
我認為電子郵件發送的下一台電腦上
只能由下一台電腦可以接收？
And I assume an e-mail sent on a NeXT computer
can only be received by a NeXT computer?

1081
00:55:08,523 --> 00:55:10,524
關閉，
端至端。
Closed,
end-to-end.

1082
00:55:10,525 --> 00:55:11,991
新的垃圾桶是錯誤的。
The new trash can is wrong.

1083
00:55:11,992 --> 00:55:14,293
我想告訴你我很欣賞
你把它付諸表決的時間，
I wanna tell you I appreciate
all the hours you put into it,

1084
00:55:14,294 --> 00:55:17,531
但我不能，因為它是多麼可怕的不是。
but I can't because of how terrible it is.

1085
00:55:17,532 --> 00:55:18,964
返回到另一個。
Go back to the other one.

1086
00:55:18,965 --> 00:55:21,567
為什麼我們仍然給
三個選項上的時鐘？
Why are we still giving
three options on the clock?

1087
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:24,871
- 如何多的選擇，你想給？
- 二。 購買或沒有。
- How many options do you want to give?
- Two. Buy it or don't.

1088
00:55:24,872 --> 00:55:26,540
我能跟你說句話嗎？
Can I talk to you for a second?

1089
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:27,674
ABSO-fruitly。
Abso-fruitly.

1090
00:55:27,675 --> 00:55:29,808
呃，你看，男人。 Avie將是被重新編譯，
Uh, look, man. Avie's been recompiling,

1091
00:55:29,809 --> 00:55:32,112
但他說，有可能是
一些小問題今天上午。
but he says there may be
some glitches this morning.

1092
00:55:32,113 --> 00:55:34,114
如果所有有一些小問題，
If all there are are some glitches,

1093
00:55:34,115 --> 00:55:36,815
這將是不可思議的幅度的勝利。
it'll be a triumph of miraculous magnitude.

1094
00:55:36,816 --> 00:55:38,884
你為什麼要翻譯的Avie將？
Why are you translating for Avie?

1095
00:55:38,885 --> 00:55:42,922
I-我不想讓他找出硬盤
這樣的故障在演示你的位置，
I-I didn't want him to find out the hard
way your position on glitches in a demo,

1096
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:44,958
但它聽起來像是你已經成熟了。
but it sounds like you've mellowed.

1097
00:55:44,959 --> 00:55:47,960
我一直在成長，安迪。 我已經
在學習愛自己。
I've been growing, Andy. I've
been learning to love myself.

1098
00:55:47,961 --> 00:55:50,230
嗯。 我也不會永遠
夢見這是一個問題。
Hmm. I wouldn't have ever
dreamed that was a problem.

1099
00:55:50,231 --> 00:55:51,830
神奇的燒傷。
Fantastic burn.

1100
00:55:51,831 --> 00:55:53,667
你需要去你的座位。
You need to go to your seat.

1101
00:55:53,668 --> 00:55:56,268
如何麗莎，進入
一所學校有天賦的孩子？
How about Lisa, getting into
a school for gifted kids?

1102
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,904
是啊，她進行了測試，
事實證明，她可以飛。
Yeah, she was tested and
it turns out she can fly.

1103
00:55:58,905 --> 00:56:01,040
- 嚴重的是，這是一個大問題。
- 我知道這是一個大問題。
- Seriously, it's a big deal.
- I know it's a big deal.

1104
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:03,576
這就是為什麼我建了學校的建築物。
That's why I built the school a building.

1105
00:56:03,577 --> 00:56:06,880
- 嗯，我敢肯定，這不是為什麼她得到了。
- 真？
- Well, I'm sure that's not why she got in.
- Really?

1106
00:56:06,881 --> 00:56:10,485
嗯，我可以告訴你的東西
有趣的<I>的Macworld？</i>
Uh, can I show you something
funny from <i>Macworld?</i>

1107
00:56:13,753 --> 00:56:17,790
- 我想不出什麼我必須做的事情。
- 這會讓你感覺良好。
- I can't think of anything I have to do right now.
- It'll make you feel good.

1108
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,793
- 喬安娜！ 看這個！
- 哦，安迪，他只得到了幾分鐘的時間。
- Joanna! Look at this!
- Oh, Andy, he's only got a couple of minutes.

1109
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,362
它蓋川崎寫
<I> Macworld大會。</i>的你會喜歡這一點。
It's Guy Kawasaki writing in
<i>Macworld.</i> You're gonna like this.

1110
00:56:23,363 --> 00:56:25,364
好了，可大家都享受在後呢？
Well, can we all enjoy it later?

1111
00:56:25,365 --> 00:56:30,235
他寫了一個模仿新聞稿
蘋果收購了NeXT為您的操作系統。
He wrote a parody press release
about Apple buying NeXT for your OS.

1112
00:56:30,236 --> 00:56:34,139
他想像不久的將來，其中蘋果
需要你的操作系統和已買了NeXT，
He imagines a near future where Apple
needs your OS and has to buy NeXT,

1113
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,842
並且，你回來擔任CEO。
and-and you come back as CEO.

1114
00:56:36,843 --> 00:56:38,310
他說，蓋茨，
He has Gates saying,

1115
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:43,284
「有現在將是更多的創新
從喬布斯認為微軟可以複製「。
"There would now be more innovations
from Jobs that Microsoft could copy."

1116
00:56:45,019 --> 00:56:48,989
- 您可以稍後閱讀。
- 謝謝。
- You can read it later.
- Thanks.

1117
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:51,625
她會一直沒有得到在
您捐贈的建築。
She would've gotten in without
you donating a building.

1118
00:56:51,626 --> 00:56:55,329
儘管如此，它的東西
在採訪中談到。
Still, it's something to
talk about in the interview.

1119
00:56:57,764 --> 00:57:00,266
好吧。 祝你好運。
All right. Good luck.

1120
00:57:00,267 --> 00:57:02,403
謝謝。
Thanks.

1121
00:57:04,005 --> 00:57:06,038
把那給我。 我會扔出來給你。
Give that to me. I'll throw it out for you.

1122
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:09,708
我要掛到它。
I'm gonna hang on to it.

1123
00:57:09,709 --> 00:57:11,277
什麼？
What?

1124
00:57:11,278 --> 00:57:13,813
什麼？
What?

1125
00:57:13,814 --> 00:57:15,848
你準備好斯卡利？
You ready for Sculley?

1126
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,784
打擾一下！
Excuse me!

1127
00:57:17,785 --> 00:57:19,685
麗莎！
Lisa!

1128
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:21,588
你不能喊！
You can't shout!

1129
00:57:28,796 --> 00:57:30,698
麗莎？
Lisa?

1130
00:57:39,907 --> 00:57:42,477
你得走了。
You have to go.

1131
00:57:43,711 --> 00:57:47,381
它的危險在這裏。 這是
為什麼我讓其他人去做。
It's dangerous up here. That's
why I make other people do it.

1132
00:57:49,115 --> 00:57:51,451
你是誰的，我和你媽媽在隱瞞什麼？
Who are you hiding from, me or your mom?

1133
00:57:51,452 --> 00:57:55,121
我沒有隱瞞。
I'm not hiding.

1134
00:57:55,122 --> 00:57:57,592
我們走吧。
Let's go.

1135
00:58:04,764 --> 00:58:07,299
你是怎麼聽？
What were you listening to?

1136
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,870
我聽兩個
同一首歌的版本。
I'm listening to two
versions of the same song.

1137
00:58:10,871 --> 00:58:14,339
然後，當我得到的兩端，我
快退，再次聽取他們的意見。
Then when I get to the ends, I
rewind to listen to them again.

1138
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:17,844
這是同一首歌，但
版本不同。
It's the same song, but
the versions are different.

1139
00:58:17,845 --> 00:58:20,380
- 有什麼歌？
- 好。
- What's the song?
- Okay.

1140
00:58:20,381 --> 00:58:23,415
所以這是一個非常古老的歌曲，
這就是所謂的「雙方，現在。」
So it's a really old song, and
it's called "Both Sides, Now."

1141
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:27,821
- 「雙方，現在」？
- 是啊。
- "Both Sides, Now"?
- Yeah.

1142
00:58:27,822 --> 00:58:29,888
這是什麼？
What's it about?

1143
00:58:29,889 --> 00:58:34,293
這是關於......有三種
詩：雲，愛情和生活。
It's about... There are three
verses: Clouds, love and life.

1144
00:58:34,294 --> 00:58:38,998
而人的歌聲唱
他們曾經認為的？
And the person singing is singing
that they used to think of...

1145
00:58:38,999 --> 00:58:40,866
他們曾經認為有關...
That they used to think about...

1146
00:58:40,867 --> 00:58:43,168
- 雲，愛情和生活？
- 對。
- Clouds, love and life?
- Right.

1147
00:58:43,169 --> 00:58:47,040
一種方式，是啊，但現在他們看起來
在他們的另一種方式，並且它們...
One way, yeah, but now they look
at them another way, and they...

1148
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:52,911
他們已經得出的結論，他們
真不知道雲，愛情或人生。
They've come to the conclusion that they
really don't know clouds, love or life at all.

1149
00:58:52,912 --> 00:58:55,415
這些都是原話。
Those are the exact words.

1150
00:58:55,416 --> 00:58:56,683
是啊，Joni Mitchell的。
Yeah, Joni Mitchell.

1151
00:58:56,684 --> 00:59:00,955
「因為它不是一個真的老了
歌，除非我是一個真正的老傢伙。
'Cause it's not a really old
song, unless I'm a really old guy.

1152
00:59:02,088 --> 00:59:04,324
你必須去上學了。
You have to go to school now.

1153
00:59:04,325 --> 00:59:07,527
你要我告訴你
這兩個版本之間的差異？
Do you want me to tell you the
differences between the two versions?

1154
00:59:07,528 --> 00:59:08,862
現在。
Right now.

1155
00:59:08,863 --> 00:59:12,431
第一個版本是什麼樣的
你會打電話少女的事情。
The first version is the kind of
thing that you would call girlish.

1156
00:59:12,432 --> 00:59:14,933
我不是那個意思，我想知道
區別現在。
I didn't mean I want to know
the difference right now.

1157
00:59:14,934 --> 00:59:17,402
我的意思是，你必須去上學，現在。
I meant you have to go to school right now.

1158
00:59:17,403 --> 00:59:19,105
我可以留下來觀看。
I can stay and watch.

1159
00:59:19,106 --> 00:59:21,373
你是逃學。 你犯了罪。
You are truant. You're committing a crime.

1160
00:59:21,374 --> 00:59:23,976
我不會錯過任何重要的東西。
I'm not gonna miss anything important.

1161
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,880
- 你怎麼知道的？
- 我讀。
- How do you know?
- I read ahead.

1162
00:59:26,881 --> 00:59:30,083
朝聖者使​​它的新世界。
The Pilgrims make it to the New World.

1163
00:59:30,084 --> 00:59:31,984
然後獨立宣言。
Then the Declaration of Independence.

1164
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,020
是啊，你跳過了幾個世紀。
Yeah, you skipped a couple centuries.

1165
00:59:34,021 --> 00:59:36,922
史蒂夫？ Chrisann的在那裏。
Steve? Chrisann's out there.

1166
00:59:43,798 --> 00:59:45,330
我們走吧。
Let's go.

1167
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,266
我可以讓我的情況下留？
Can I make my case for staying?

1168
00:59:47,267 --> 00:59:49,236
都能跟得上。
Nope.

1169
01:00:07,822 --> 01:00:10,889
- 她是我的。
- 加油。 你爸爸不希望我們留。
- She was with me.
- Come on. Your dad doesn't want us to stay.

1170
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:13,960
這不是真的。 這不是...
That's not true. That's not...

1171
01:00:13,961 --> 01:00:16,328
你必須要在學校裏就是一切。
You have to be in school is all.

1172
01:00:16,329 --> 01:00:19,998
我犯了罪，現在，
我不想惹上麻煩。
I'm committing a crime right now,
and I don't wanna get in trouble.

1173
01:00:19,999 --> 01:00:22,569
你不是麻煩了。 我是開玩笑的。
You're not in trouble. I was kidding.

1174
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:24,103
好。
Okay.

1175
01:00:24,104 --> 01:00:26,605
嘿。 什麼是第二個版本？
Hey. What was the second version?

1176
01:00:26,606 --> 01:00:29,843
你說的第一個版本是
少女。 什麼是第二個版本？
You said the first version was
girlish. What was the second version?

1177
01:00:31,278 --> 01:00:33,045
我真的不能想到的詞。
I can't really think of the word.

1178
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,848
好。 好了，日子過好學校。
Okay. Well, have a good day at school.

1179
01:00:34,849 --> 01:00:37,217
- 遺憾。
- 什麼？
- Regretful.
- What?

1180
01:00:37,218 --> 01:00:40,118
就像希望你可以去
背部和做的事情不同。
Like wishing you could go
back and do things different.

1181
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:42,388
你太年輕了，追悔莫及。
You're too young to be regretful.

1182
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:44,891
不是我。
Not me.

1183
01:00:44,892 --> 01:00:47,627
此人演唱的歌曲。
The person singing the song.

1184
01:00:47,628 --> 01:00:51,499
得到它了。 遺憾。 那
有意義的，因為...
Got it. Regretful. That
makes sense because...

1185
01:00:54,034 --> 01:00:56,537
我想和你一起生活。
I wanna live with you.

1186
01:01:09,048 --> 01:01:11,150
六分鐘。
Six minutes.

1187
01:01:11,151 --> 01:01:13,754
- 你想看到斯卡利？
- 沒有。
- You want to see Sculley?
- No.

1188
01:01:22,528 --> 01:01:25,931
你知道那些時候，我
告訴你，你需要的安全性？
You know all those times I
told you you needed security?

1189
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,535
這裏的原因。
Here's why.

1190
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:36,442
我不知道是怎麼回事我已經
變老，你有沒有。
I don't know how it is I've
gotten older and you haven't.

1191
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:39,478
一些交易與魔鬼
我從來沒有提供。
Some deal with the devil
I was never offered.

1192
01:01:39,479 --> 01:01:42,047
所以，你知道我一直
思為過去四年？
So you know what I've been
thinking for the last four years?

1193
01:01:42,048 --> 01:01:45,685
事實證明，約翰，我從來沒有
已知的是自己所想。
As it turns out, John, I've never
known what you were thinking.

1194
01:01:45,686 --> 01:01:48,453
沒有新生嬰兒有控制權。
No newborn baby has control.

1195
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:50,389
你知道我在說什麼？
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1196
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:52,592
在84年之前，蘋果推出。 你說...
In '84, before the Mac launch. You said...

1197
01:01:52,593 --> 01:01:56,161
- 是啊。
- 你說，正在通過意味著你沒有控制權。
- Yeah.
- You said that being adopted meant you didn't have control.

1198
01:01:56,162 --> 01:01:57,496
我們開始在一分鐘內，所以...
We're starting in a minute, so...

1199
01:01:57,497 --> 01:01:59,998
為什麼人們覺得我開除你？
Why do people think I fired you?

1200
01:01:59,999 --> 01:02:02,102
它的罰款，約翰。 這一切都在我們身後。
It's fine, John. It's all behind us.

1201
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:08,107
是嗎？ 嗯？
Is it? Hmm?

1202
01:02:08,108 --> 01:02:10,745
不要打懵。 你不能把它關閉。
Don't play stupid. You can't pull it off.

1203
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:15,949
你來這裏問我為什麼
讓人覺得你開除我嗎？
You came here to ask me why
people think you fired me?

1204
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:17,985
為什麼人們覺得我開除你？
Why do people think I fired you?

1205
01:02:19,218 --> 01:02:21,856
只是確認我的東西，好嗎？
Just confirm something for me, okay?

1206
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:25,024
你喜歡這個廣告，對吧？
You liked the ad, right?

1207
01:02:25,025 --> 01:02:26,692
商業...「1984年」 你喜歡它。
The commercial... "1984." You liked it.

1208
01:02:26,693 --> 01:02:30,029
- 你什麼時候拿到的傢俱？
- 這不是一個簡單的過程。
- When are you gonna get furniture?
- It's not an easy process.

1209
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:32,130
它是。 你買一個沙發上，把它從那裏。
It is. You buy a couch, take it from there.

1210
01:02:32,131 --> 01:02:35,634
我想，如果你來真的很奇怪
這裏談談室內裝潢。
I'd be really surprised if you came
here to talk about interior decorating.

1211
01:02:35,635 --> 01:02:37,069
我喜歡的廣告非常多。
I liked the ad very much.

1212
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:38,170
- 你做？
- 你知道我做到了。
- You did?
- You know I did.

1213
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,440
你是一個說謊的兒子
婊子。 你試圖殺死它。
You're a lying son of a
bitch. You tried to kill it.

1214
01:02:40,441 --> 01:02:43,342
- 現在是時候認真考慮在Mac上。
- 這是過去的時間。
- It's time to take a hard look at the Mac.
- It's past time.

1215
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:47,513
它的價格過高。 我們
需要將其拖放〜1995。
It's overpriced. We
need to drop it to 1,995.

1216
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:49,449
我們需要雙倍的營銷預算，
We need to double the marketing budget,

1217
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:51,284
把更多的機構內部硬盤驅動器
put more bodies on an internal hard drive

1218
01:02:51,285 --> 01:02:52,652
並投資於文件服務器。
and invest in FileServer.

1219
01:02:52,653 --> 01:02:55,321
- 到底在哪弄來我想殺的想法...
- 李克勞。
- Where the hell did you get the idea I tried to kill...
- Lee Clow.

1220
01:02:55,322 --> 01:02:57,089
- 他在說謊？
- 他是...錯了。
- Lee's wrong.
- He's lying?

1221
01:02:57,090 --> 01:02:59,257
- 會在哪裏的錢從何而來？
這將來自最後
- He's... mistaken.
- Where would the money come from?

1222
01:02:59,258 --> 01:03:01,460
擺脫蘋果II的。
蘋果II是
It would come from finally
getting rid of the Apple II.

1223
01:03:01,461 --> 01:03:03,362
唯一賺錢。
- 您同意審計委員會。
The Apple II is the
only thing making money.

1224
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:06,466
- 我明白了董事會的關注，但我...
董事會的關注，
- You agreed with the board.
- I understood the board's concerns, but I...

1225
01:03:06,467 --> 01:03:08,534
我們沒有表現出產品？
- 別的不說，但我的問題是......
The board's concerns that
we didn't show the product?

1226
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:10,536
- 什麼其他的事情？
我這麼問是因為我很好奇。
- Among other things, but my question was...
- What other things?

1227
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:13,672
你說：「等等。」
除其他事項外，它是
I'm asking because I'm curious.
You said "among other things."

1228
01:03:13,673 --> 01:03:16,442
在一個反烏托邦星系設置。
它發生在一個星球
Among other things, it was
set in a dystopian galaxy.

1229
01:03:16,443 --> 01:03:18,411
我們不住。
天很黑，我們的品牌是相反的。
It took place on a planet
where we don't live.

1230
01:03:18,412 --> 01:03:20,446
<i>和</i>的我們沒有顯示產品。
It was dark and the opposite of our brand.

1231
01:03:20,447 --> 01:03:22,681
讓人津津樂道的廣告，但大部分
<i>And</i> we didn't show the product.

1232
01:03:22,682 --> 01:03:26,451
他們不知道我們在賣。
Mac電腦需要賣1995。
People talked about the ad but most of
them didn't know what we were selling.

1233
01:03:26,452 --> 01:03:28,487
有沒有市場調研告訴我們
The Mac needs to sell for 1,995.

1234
01:03:28,488 --> 01:03:32,525
在Mac失敗，因為它的價格過高。
它告訴我們，人們不喜歡它
There is no market research telling us
the Mac is failing because it's overpriced.

1235
01:03:32,526 --> 01:03:36,429
因為他們認為它不會做任何事情。
它的關閉，
It's telling us that people don't like it
because they think it doesn't do anything.

1236
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:38,764
端至端。
我們不知道這是不是
It's closed,
end-to-end.

1237
01:03:38,765 --> 01:03:41,433
人們希望，但事實並非如此。
他們希望插槽，他們希望
We didn't know it wasn't what
people wanted, but it isn't.

1238
01:03:41,434 --> 01:03:43,502
選擇，他們想要的選項。
在路上，我們買的音響...
They want slots, they want
choices, they want options.

1239
01:03:43,503 --> 01:03:45,804
混搭組件。
約翰，聽我說。 誰
The way we buy stereos...
mix and match components.

1240
01:03:45,805 --> 01:03:48,473
說顧客永遠是對的
是的，我答應你，一個客戶。
John, listen to me. Whoever
said the customer is always right

1241
01:03:48,474 --> 01:03:50,243
- 它有它的光頭黨。
was, I promise you, a customer.

1242
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:52,444
- 她被解放出來。
- 解放的光頭黨。
- It had skinheads in it.
- She was liberating them.

1243
01:03:52,445 --> 01:03:55,580
- 廣告沒有任何與他媽的光頭黨。
我們把他們當作他媽的演員。
- Liberating the skinheads.
- The ad didn't have anything to do with fucking skinheads.

1244
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,350
甚至沒有人知道他們是光頭。
We used them as fucking extras.

1245
01:03:57,351 --> 01:03:58,717
我只是說，審計委員會關注...
Nobody even knows they were skinheads.

1246
01:03:58,718 --> 01:04:01,187
你發明了生活方式的廣告。
I'm just saying the board had concerns...

1247
01:04:01,188 --> 01:04:03,089
而我們的品牌是我的品牌。
You invented lifestyle advertising.

1248
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,824
我的工作是使
And our brand was my brand.

1249
01:04:04,825 --> 01:04:07,627
推薦給董事會。
我們發現了很多的快樂
My job is to make a
recommendation to the board.

1250
01:04:07,628 --> 01:04:08,995
人們喝百事可樂。
我們沒有說世界就要
We showed a lot of happy
people drinking Pepsi.

1251
01:04:08,996 --> 01:04:12,498
最終，如果你買了胡椒博士。
建議我們放棄價格
We didn't say the world was going
to end if you bought a Dr. Pepper.

1252
01:04:12,499 --> 01:04:15,268
和雙倍的營銷預算。
- 我不能。
Recommend that we drop the price
and double the marketing budget.

1253
01:04:15,269 --> 01:04:17,770
-  <i>和</i>我們展示的產品。
我們發現它被打開，我們發現
- I can't.
- <i>And</i> we showed the product.

1254
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:21,473
它傾倒，被消耗。
你要去做什麼，
We showed it being opened, we showed
it being poured, being consumed.

1255
01:04:21,474 --> 01:04:23,643
建議我們殺的Mac嗎？
我已經有了，史蒂夫。
What are you gonna do,
recommend that we kill the Mac?

1256
01:04:23,644 --> 01:04:26,046
什麼？ 什麼時候？
I already have, Steve.

1257
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:30,149
你認為這個秘密對您的成功
What? When?

1258
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:31,717
沒有假設人都知道
You think the secret to your success

1259
01:04:31,718 --> 01:04:34,087
做什麼用一罐汽水？
我沒有殺廣告，史蒂夫！ 我是
was not assuming people knew
what to do with a can of soda?

1260
01:04:34,088 --> 01:04:37,489
唯一的原因，它使人們對空氣。
剛剛。 一小時前。
I didn't kill the ad, Steve! I'm the
only reason it made it on the air.

1261
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:39,659
我是從馬庫拉的房子來了。
Just now. An hour ago.

1262
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:41,359
他說什麼？
I'm coming from Markkula's house.

1263
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:44,362
- 他說什麼？
What did he say?

1264
01:04:44,363 --> 01:04:46,466
- 發明新的東西。
我給你一個團隊。 您可以在毛伊島坐。
- What did he say?
- Invent something new.

1265
01:04:46,467 --> 01:04:48,301
該度假村設有沙發。
I'll give you a team. You can sit in Maui.

1266
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:49,603
等一下。 你是說你
The resorts come with couches.

1267
01:04:49,604 --> 01:04:54,806
建議終止在Mac
或者您建議採取
Wait a minute. Are you saying you
recommended terminating the Mac

1268
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:56,775
我從Mac的球隊嗎？
我們買了三個景點中
or you recommended taking
me off the Mac team?

1269
01:04:56,776 --> 01:04:59,812
超級碗。 二30年代和60。
經過我們篩選吧，
We bought three spots in the
Super Bowl. Two 30's and a 60.

1270
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:01,681
董事會希望這筆錢回來
他們問我賣掉了點。
After we screened it, the
board wanted that money back

1271
01:05:01,682 --> 01:05:03,616
Chiat / Day公司賣斷了
and they asked me to sell off the spots.

1272
01:05:03,617 --> 01:05:06,118
二三十的，但不是60，
我讓人們知道到李克勞
Chiat/Day sold off the
two 30's but not the 60,

1273
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:07,552
如果他沒有嘗試很
and I let it be known to Lee Clow

1274
01:05:07,553 --> 01:05:09,788
不好賣的最後一個景點，
我也不會不高興。
that if he didn't try very
hard to sell the last spot,

1275
01:05:09,789 --> 01:05:11,424
如果我們放棄價格
I wouldn't be unhappy.

1276
01:05:11,425 --> 01:05:13,493
和雙預算...
價格下跌或兩倍的預算。
If we drop the price
and double the budget...

1277
01:05:13,494 --> 01:05:15,228
做到這一點的唯一方法是
Drop the price or double the budget.

1278
01:05:15,229 --> 01:05:17,763
拿錢出來的蘋果II的。
蘋果II應該為難
The only way to do that is to
take money out of the Apple II.

1279
01:05:17,764 --> 01:05:20,533
您。 這尷尬了我。
它不為難股東。
The Apple II should embarrass
you. It embarrasses me.

1280
01:05:20,534 --> 01:05:22,400
我不給一個關於股東狗屎。
It doesn't embarrass the shareholders.

1281
01:05:22,401 --> 01:05:23,768
這就是為什麼我雇你，所以我不知道
I don't give a shit about the shareholders.

1282
01:05:23,769 --> 01:05:26,371
有聽到股東。
股東是我的問題，
That's why I hired you, so I don't
have to hear about shareholders.

1283
01:05:26,372 --> 01:05:29,808
董事會代表股東。
這就是它是如何工作的。
The shareholders are my problem, and
the board represents the shareholders.

1284
01:05:29,809 --> 01:05:31,676
你確定這不是李克勞誰
That's how it works.

1285
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:34,279
拖著腳賣60？
在我的方向，史蒂夫。
You sure it wasn't Lee Clow who
dragged his feet selling the 60?

1286
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,716
你認為他會那樣做
At my direction, Steve.

1287
01:05:36,717 --> 01:05:39,585
對自己，把它做為自己？
是啊。 我想他會已經做了
You think he would have done that
on his own, taken it on himself?

1288
01:05:39,586 --> 01:05:42,288
什麼了，從你保存它。
- 我是唯一保護它。
Yeah. I think he would've done
what it took to save it from you.

1289
01:05:42,289 --> 01:05:44,824
- 你不想要的廣告
因為你試圖殺死
- I was the only thing protecting it.
- You didn't want the ad

1290
01:05:44,825 --> 01:05:47,859
蘋果前兩個月就推出。
你他媽的妄想。
because you were trying to kill the
Mac two months before it launched.

1291
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,063
- 我可以提東西給你？
You are fucking delusional.

1292
01:05:52,832 --> 01:05:54,699
- 當然。
我沒有世俗的想法，為什麼你在這裏。
- Can I mention something to you?
- Sure.

1293
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,271
為什麼以及如何離開蘋果公司的故事，
I have no earthly idea why you're here.

1294
01:05:58,838 --> 01:06:02,174
這是迅速成為
The story of why and how you left Apple,

1295
01:06:02,175 --> 01:06:04,911
神話，是不正確的。
- 我要借此向董事會自己。
which is quickly becoming
mythologized, isn't true.

1296
01:06:04,912 --> 01:06:07,413
- 不要那樣做。
- 我<I>（上午）</i>這樣做。
- I'm gonna take this to the board myself.
- Don't do that.

1297
01:06:07,414 --> 01:06:09,181
- 你不能。
為什麼？
- I <i>am</i> doing that.
- You can't.

1298
01:06:09,182 --> 01:06:11,817
他們認為你不再
Why?

1299
01:06:11,818 --> 01:06:15,122
要這家公司。
我得到的仇恨郵件，死亡威脅。
They believe you're no longer
necessary to this company.

1300
01:06:19,425 --> 01:06:24,563
我得到的死亡威脅。
I get hate mail, death threats.

1301
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:28,201
我的孩子越來越嘲弄。
I get death threats.

1302
01:06:28,202 --> 01:06:32,072
為什麼人們覺得我開除你？
喬安娜的要叫我的名字在第二。
My kids are getting taunted.
Why do people think I fired you?

1303
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:35,942
- 史蒂夫？
Joanna's gonna call my name in a second.

1304
01:06:35,943 --> 01:06:37,810
- 這是未經排練。
是的，我會在那裏，在短短一秒鐘。
- Steve?
- That was unrehearsed.

1305
01:06:37,811 --> 01:06:39,511
我在法庭上給你新的一天。
Yeah, I'll be there in just a second.

1306
01:06:39,512 --> 01:06:41,746
- 你給我？
I gave you your day in court.

1307
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:43,348
- 我給董事會一個明確的選擇。
我說，「你想投資於蘋果
- You gave me?
- I gave the board a clear choice.

1308
01:06:43,349 --> 01:06:46,953
II或Mac嗎？「他們選擇了蘋果II。
誰曾想相同的人
I said, "Do you want to invest in the Apple
II or the Mac?" They chose the Apple II.

1309
01:06:46,954 --> 01:06:49,288
轉儲超級碗現場。
然後我坐上飛機到中國。
The same people who wanted
to dump the Super Bowl spot.

1310
01:06:49,289 --> 01:06:51,358
斯卡利先生。 有一個
And then I got on a plane to China.

1311
01:06:52,892 --> 01:06:55,427
要求你的一號線。
或者，我差點坐上飛機，
Mr. Sculley. There's a
call for you on Line One.

1312
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:58,697
因為我在休息室的電話。
- 誰創造了這一呼籲？
Or I almost got on a plane,
because I got a call in the lounge.

1313
01:06:58,698 --> 01:07:00,433
- 無所謂。
<I>這與我有關的。 誰打了電話？</i>
- Who made that call?
- Doesn't matter.

1314
01:07:00,434 --> 01:07:01,967
約翰斯卡利。
<i>It matters to me. Who made the call?</i>

1315
01:07:01,968 --> 01:07:03,168
<I>約翰？ 如果你上飛機，</i>
John Sculley.

1316
01:07:03,169 --> 01:07:05,004
<I>你已經失去了你
<i>John? If you get on that plane,</i>

1317
01:07:05,005 --> 01:07:07,906
工作由它的土地，時間</i>
<I>史蒂夫是被調用
<i>you'll have lost your
job by the time it lands.</i>

1318
01:07:07,907 --> 01:07:11,509
板。 他想你了。</i>
<I>我的行李上飛機。 我的
<i>Steve's been calling the
board. He wants you out.</i>

1319
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:14,513
媽的還在北京的某個地方。</i>
我拍了車回庫比提諾
<i>I left my bags on the plane. My
shit's still somewhere in Beijing.</i>

1320
01:07:14,514 --> 01:07:17,549
該他媽的半夜。
我知道這是什麼時候。 我需要的法定人數
I took a car back to Cupertino in
the middle of the fucking night.

1321
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:22,355
這裏在一個小時內，我想史蒂夫在這裏了。
<I>你把我關在Mac，
I know what time it is. I need a quorum
here in one hour and I want Steve here too.

1322
01:07:22,356 --> 01:07:24,857
它是壞的生意。</i>
- 仲裁電話是一宗兇殺案。
<i>You took me off the Mac,
and it was bad business.</i>

1323
01:07:24,858 --> 01:07:27,726
- 在那裏！ 在那裏。
這就是一部分是廢話，我的朋友。
- The quorum call was a homicide.
- Right there! Right there.

1324
01:07:27,727 --> 01:07:29,462
這是一起自殺事件。
That's the part that's bullshit, my friend.

1325
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:30,929
因為你知道你的
It was a suicide.

1326
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:33,665
卡和我向您展示我的。
我給你我的，反正你做到了。
Because you knew your
cards and I showed you mine.

1327
01:07:33,666 --> 01:07:36,534
你以為我是什麼怎麼辦？
I showed you mine, and you did it anyway.

1328
01:07:36,535 --> 01:07:37,937
我好失敗，但我不會沒收。
What did you think I was gonna do?

1329
01:07:37,938 --> 01:07:40,605
我不是沒事失敗。
I'm okay losing, but I'm not gonna forfeit.

1330
01:07:40,606 --> 01:07:43,308
<I>我們正在失去市場份額，
I'm not okay losing.

1331
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,745
和Mac是賠錢的。</i>
我們唯一的希望就是蘋果II，這是停滯不前
<i>We're losing market share,
and the Mac is losing money.</i>

1332
01:07:45,746 --> 01:07:50,949
因為它即將成為過時的DOS。
用戶已經在操縱他們的機器
Our only hope is the Apple II, which is stagnating
because of its soon-to-be-obsolete DOS.

1333
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:54,386
到具有CP / M操作系統上運行
一個已經建成的英特爾運行。
Users are already rigging their machines
to run with a CP/M operating system

1334
01:07:54,387 --> 01:07:55,755
我不能把它更簡單莫過於此。
that's been built to run on Intel.

1335
01:07:55,756 --> 01:07:57,857
我們需要把我們的資源
I can't put it more simply than this.

1336
01:07:57,858 --> 01:08:00,859
到更新的Apple II。
<I>通過從Mac獲取資源。</i>
We need to put our resources
into updating the Apple II.

1337
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:03,562
<I>它的失敗。 這是一個事實。</i>
<i>By taking resources from the Mac.</i>

1338
01:08:03,563 --> 01:08:04,964
- 它的價格過高。
<i>It's failing. That's a fact.</i>

1339
01:08:04,965 --> 01:08:06,998
- 有沒有證據表明它是......
我的證據！
- It's overpriced.
- There's no evidence that it's...

1340
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:08,900
我是世界領先的專家
I'm the evidence!

1341
01:08:08,901 --> 01:08:12,772
在Mac，約翰。 什麼是你的簡歷嗎？
你發出矛盾的指示，
I'm the world's leading expert on
the Mac, John. What's your resume?

1342
01:08:12,773 --> 01:08:14,706
你是違抗命令，
You're issuing contradictory instructions,

1343
01:08:14,707 --> 01:08:16,709
你讓人苦不堪言。
我們的頂尖工程師
you're insubordinate,
you make people miserable.

1344
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:19,844
逃亡到Sun，戴爾，惠普。
<I>美股不知道
Our top engineers are
fleeing to Sun, Dell, HP.

1345
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:21,981
誰在駕駛公車。</i>
我們的價值損失了數億。
<i>Wall Street doesn't know
who's driving the bus.</i>

1346
01:08:21,982 --> 01:08:24,049
而我蘋果的CEO，
We've lost hundreds of millions in value.

1347
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:27,686
史蒂夫。 這是我的簡歷。
但在此之前，你賣
And I'm the CEO of Apple,
Steve. That's my resume.

1348
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:30,522
碳酸糖水，對不對？
我坐在一個他媽的車庫
But before that, you sold
carbonated sugar water, right?

1349
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:34,427
沃茲尼亞克發明了未來。
因為藝術家鉛，
I sat in a fucking garage with
Wozniak and invented the future.

1350
01:08:34,428 --> 01:08:37,862
黑客要求舉手。
好吧。
Because artists lead and
hacks ask for a show of hands.

1351
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:38,864
好了，這傢伙的失控。
All right.

1352
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:40,865
我完全願意出手
Well, this guy's out of control.

1353
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:43,602
在我的辭職今晚，
但如果你要我
I'm perfectly willing to hand
in my resignation tonight,

1354
01:08:43,603 --> 01:08:45,538
留下來，你不能有史蒂夫。
but if you want me to
stay, you can't have Steve.

1355
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:47,740
安頓他。
Settle him out.

1356
01:08:47,741 --> 01:08:50,843
他可以保持股票的份額
所以他得到我們的通訊。
He can keep a share of stock
so he gets our newsletter.

1357
01:08:50,844 --> 01:08:53,478
<I>，他將不得不切斷他
連接至蘋果。</i>
<i>He'll have to sever his
connection to Apple.</i>

1358
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:57,384
我死了嚴重的。 我想要的
呼籲投票的秘書。
I'm dead serious. I want the
secretary to call for a vote.

1359
01:08:58,985 --> 01:09:02,088
我他媽的敢。
I fucking dare you.

1360
01:09:02,089 --> 01:09:07,759
你已經做了一個出色的工作
這些年來培育的新聞。
You have done an outstanding job over
the years of cultivating the press.

1361
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,294
而由，我的意思是操縱他們。
And by that, I mean manipulating them.

1362
01:09:09,295 --> 01:09:12,932
因為其中沒有，沒有其
編輯，沒有自己編輯的出版商
Because none of them, none of their
editors, none of their editors' publishers

1363
01:09:12,933 --> 01:09:15,066
這一天知道你強迫它，
to this day know that you forced it,

1364
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:17,035
<I>你迫使板。</i>
<i>that you forced the board.</i>

1365
01:09:17,036 --> 01:09:19,371
<I>即使我告訴你
正是他們想要做的，</i>
<i>Even after I told you
exactly what they'd do,</i>

1366
01:09:19,372 --> 01:09:21,473
而這正是他們做到了。
which is exactly what they did.

1367
01:09:21,474 --> 01:09:23,875
一致通過。
Unanimously.

1368
01:09:23,876 --> 01:09:26,579
我沒有任何麻煩
記住的是，約翰，
I don't have any trouble
remembering that, John,

1369
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:30,048
因為它是在
我生命中最糟糕的夜晚。
because of it being the
worst night of my life.

1370
01:09:30,049 --> 01:09:33,151
我不得不票，因為
我相信我是對的。
And I forced the vote because
I believed I was right.

1371
01:09:33,152 --> 01:09:36,289
我仍然相信我是對的。 而我是對的。
I still believe I'm right. And I'm right.

1372
01:09:37,758 --> 01:09:39,525
現在，我流血的夜晚。
Now I bled that night.

1373
01:09:39,526 --> 01:09:41,694
<i>和我不流血。</i>
<i>And I don't bleed.</i>

1374
01:09:41,695 --> 01:09:43,396
<I>但是時間的完成了的事情，</i>
<i>But time's done its thing,</i>

1375
01:09:43,397 --> 01:09:45,998
<i>和我真的沒有
在一段時間想過這個問題。</i>
<i>and I really haven't
thought about it in a while.</i>

1376
01:09:45,999 --> 01:09:50,669
現在，我絕對
理解你為什麼不高興。
Now, I absolutely
understand why you're upset.

1377
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:52,737
<i>和我想的人
知道事情的真相了。</i>
<i>And I want people to
know the truth too.</i>

1378
01:09:52,738 --> 01:09:54,839
它的時間。
It's time.

1379
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,741
得到它了。
Got it.

1380
01:09:56,742 --> 01:09:58,843
你會結束我的，是嗎？
You're gonna end me, aren't you?

1381
01:09:58,844 --> 01:10:01,112
你是荒謬的。
You're being ridiculous.

1382
01:10:01,113 --> 01:10:04,482
我會坐在中心球場
看著你自己做。
I'm gonna sit center court
and watch you do it yourself.

1383
01:10:04,483 --> 01:10:08,119
然後，我會為了一個漂亮的餐
一個1955年瑪歌，並簽署一些簽名。
Then I'm gonna order a nice meal with
a '55 Margaux and sign some autographs.

1384
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,856
- 耶穌基督。
- 你想咨詢，百事一代？
- Jesus Christ.
- You want some advice, Pepsi Generation?

1385
01:10:10,857 --> 01:10:13,592
不要發送沃茲了一巴掌
我周圍的記者。
Don't send Woz out to slap
me around in the press.

1386
01:10:13,593 --> 01:10:16,195
任何人......你，馬庫拉，亞瑟岩石。
Anybody else... you, Markkula, Arthur Rock.

1387
01:10:16,196 --> 01:10:17,896
任何人，但雨人。
Anyone but Rain Man.

1388
01:10:17,897 --> 01:10:20,432
不要操縱他那樣。
Don't manipulate him like that.

1389
01:10:20,433 --> 01:10:24,102
無論你可能會想，我
總是要去保護他。
Whatever you may think, I'm
always gonna protect him.

1390
01:10:24,103 --> 01:10:26,205
來吧，史蒂夫。
Come on, Steve.

1391
01:10:27,573 --> 01:10:30,176
這就是男人。
That's what men do.

1392
01:10:30,177 --> 01:10:32,512
我們不能起步較晚。
We can't start late.

1393
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:47,494
我不認為有什麼辦法
檢測在我的肩膀上的芯片。
I don't think there was any way
to detect a chip on my shoulder.

1394
01:10:48,795 --> 01:10:50,295
你知道嗎，回到Bandley，
Did you know, back at Bandley,

1395
01:10:50,296 --> 01:10:54,600
在Mac團隊每年都發表了獲獎
到誰能夠站起來，你的人？
the Mac team gave an award every year
to the person who could stand up to you?

1396
01:10:54,601 --> 01:10:55,734
沒有。
No.

1397
01:10:55,735 --> 01:11:00,573
- 我贏了。 三年成一排。
- 涼。
- I won. Three years in a row.
- Cool.

1398
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:05,811
本。
This.

1399
01:11:05,812 --> 01:11:09,882
這......這傢伙川崎
在<I> Macworld大會。</i>
This... This Guy Kawasaki
in <i>Macworld.</i>

1400
01:11:09,883 --> 01:11:12,651
他意外地得到了它的權利，不是嗎？
He accidentally got it right, didn't he?

1401
01:11:12,652 --> 01:11:14,219
你已經拖
你的腳在下一代操作系統
You've been dragging
your feet on the NeXT OS

1402
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:17,623
直到你可以計算出
什麼蘋果會需要。
till you can figure out
what Apple's gonna need.

1403
01:11:19,159 --> 01:11:22,828
即使這是真的，這不
聲音的惡魔給我。
Even if that were true, it doesn't
sound that diabolical to me.

1404
01:11:22,829 --> 01:11:24,530
嘿。 我們已經準備好為您服務。
Hey. We're ready for you.

1405
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,543
我是你最親密的紅顏知己，
你......你最好的朋友。
I'm your closest confidante,
your... your best friend.

1406
01:11:37,544 --> 01:11:40,713
你的事......你叫什麼呢？
Your thing... What do you call it?

1407
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:42,882
你工作的妻子。 整個時間。
Your work wife. The whole time.

1408
01:11:42,883 --> 01:11:44,883
近三年。
The last three years.

1409
01:11:48,921 --> 01:11:54,660
你什麼時候改變主意，並開始
建設史蒂夫·喬布斯復仇機？
When did you change your mind and start
building the Steve Jobs Revenge Machine?

1410
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:59,697
房子的一半。
House to half.

1411
01:11:59,698 --> 01:12:02,302
你還記得天空實驗室？
You remember Skylab?

1412
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:09,941
這是一個無人的衛星國家航空航天局發射了
七十年代初期，在數據採集任務。
It was an unmanned satellite NASA sent up in
the early '70s on a data gathering mission.

1413
01:12:09,942 --> 01:12:12,611
問題是，當他們把它起來，
The thing is, when they sent it up,

1414
01:12:12,612 --> 01:12:15,146
他們還不知道怎麼樣
他們會拿回來。
they didn't know yet how
they were gonna get it back.

1415
01:12:15,147 --> 01:12:17,182
但他們覺得他們是非常接近
But they felt like they were close enough

1416
01:12:17,183 --> 01:12:20,619
<I>，在八年是要去
是在那裏，他們會看著辦吧。</i>
<i>that in the eight years it was gonna
be up there, they'd figure it out.</i>

1417
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:22,087
他們在路上了。
They're on their way now.

1418
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:24,822
他們沒有這樣做。
They didn't.

1419
01:12:24,823 --> 01:12:26,892
所以經過八年來，轟然倒塌
So after eight years, it came crashing down

1420
01:12:26,893 --> 01:12:29,561
在千里大片
整個印度洋。
in a thousand-mile swath
across the Indian Ocean.

1421
01:12:29,562 --> 01:12:31,996
<I>小到左邊，
稍微向右，</i>的
<i>A little to the left,
a little to the right,</i>

1422
01:12:31,997 --> 01:12:33,966
<I>有人本來可以傷害。</i>
<i>somebody could have gotten hurt.</i>

1423
01:12:33,967 --> 01:12:38,102
我真的想建立
一個計算機學院。
I really wanted to build
a computer for colleges.

1424
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:40,705
該技術只是沒趕上
最多，因為我需要它的速度。
The technology just didn't catch
up as fast as I needed it to.

1425
01:12:40,706 --> 01:12:42,975
<I>你知道我們出的錢。</i>
<i>You know we're out of money.</i>

1426
01:12:42,976 --> 01:12:45,276
<I>女士們，先生們，程序
將啟動瞬間。</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the program
will be starting momentarily.</i>

1427
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:48,580
<I>但隨後蘋果停止創新，
我看到一些更好的東西。</i>
<i>But then Apple stopped innovating,
and I saw something better.</i>

1428
01:12:48,581 --> 01:12:53,718
喬安娜，我知道學校是不是要購買
一個$ 13,000個字典，良好的揚聲器。
Joanna, I know schools aren't gonna buy
a $13,000 dictionary with good speakers.

1429
01:12:53,719 --> 01:12:55,755
你知道，我知道。
You know I know that.

1430
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:59,258
但蘋果會。
But Apple will.

1431
01:12:59,259 --> 01:13:02,828
「原因阿瓦德斯·特凡尼安是要去
建立他們正是他們所需要的操作系統。
'Cause Avie Tevanian is gonna
build them exactly the OS they need.

1432
01:13:02,829 --> 01:13:05,731
<I>他們會要我買了。</i>
<i>They're gonna have to buy me too.</i>

1433
01:13:05,732 --> 01:13:11,671
對於半十億美元的股票
及端至端器上的每一個產品。
For half a billion dollars in stock
and end-to-end control on every product.

1434
01:13:42,402 --> 01:13:46,372
女士們，先生們，請歡迎...
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome...

1435
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:53,277
<I>一年多後，這是第一次
推出業內人士介紹，</i>
<i>More than a year after it was first
unveiled to industry insiders,</i>

1436
01:13:53,278 --> 01:13:56,014
<I>下一台計算機是
終於可以在商店。</i>
<i>the NeXT Computer is
finally available in stores.</i>

1437
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:59,752
<i>和它似乎是兩個
在連續的史蒂夫·喬布斯罷工。</i>
<i>And it appears to be two
strikes in a row for Steve Jobs.</i>

1438
01:13:59,753 --> 01:14:01,186
<I>學生和教育工作者</i>
<i>Students and educators</i>

1439
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:04,289
<I>發現很難
證明了該機的性價比很高。</i>
<i>are finding it difficult to
justify the machine's high cost.</i>

1440
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:06,191
<I>這麼多的黑色立方體。</i>
<i>So much for the black cube.</i>

1441
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:11,129
<I>下一步剛剛出售了其工廠佳能
奠定了一半的員工。</i>
<i>NeXT just sold its factory to Canon
and laid off half its employees.</i>

1442
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:14,165
在計算機的世界裏，
它的殺人或被殺。
In the world of computers,
it's kill or be killed.

1443
01:14:14,166 --> 01:14:16,301
蘋果電腦已經陷入了困境。
Apple Computer has fallen on hard times.

1444
01:14:16,302 --> 01:14:19,103
這是裁員約2500人。
It is laying off about 2,500 people.

1445
01:14:19,104 --> 01:14:21,306
<I>蘋果正在繼續
失去市場份額，<​​/ I>
<i>Apple is continuing
to lose market share,</i>

1446
01:14:21,307 --> 01:14:24,142

管道除了牛頓，</i>

pipeline except the Newton,</i>

1447

<i>a pet project of CEO John Sculley.</i>

1448

<I>如果你真的想成為
手機，你想要一個牛頓PDA。</i>
<i>If you really want to be
mobile, you want a Newton PDA.</i>

1449
01:14:29,948 --> 01:14:31,417
<I>但話又說回來，也許你不知道。</i>
<i>But then again, maybe you don't.</i>

<I>原來手寫
為電腦文本。</i>
<i>It turns handwriting
into computer text.</i>

1451
01:14:34,754 --> 01:14:38,692
嘿，多爾夫，採取了備忘錄上
牛頓。 「打了馬丁。」
Hey, Dolph, take a memo on
your Newton. "Beat up Martin."

1452
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:42,261
呸!
Bah!

<i>In 1980, Apple had
30% of the market.</i>

<I>今天，蘋果只有3.2％。</i>
<i>Today, Apple has only 3.2 percent.</i>

1455

已經被Apple開除的。</i>
<i>That's it. John Sculley
has been fired from Apple.</i>

你知道呢？
What about this Internet thing?
Do you know anything about that?

1457
01:14:55,709 --> 01:14:58,444
這是大的新事物。
It is the big new thing.

1458

seconds then come back on again. In theory.

- We think that's legal?
- No, we're very certain it's not.

1496
01:17:17,116 --> 01:17:19,484

- 對不起。
- 從那裏把它撿起來，請。
- I'm sorry.
- Pick it up from there, please.

我們只有幾個
分鐘，所以讓我們只是做了360。
We only have a couple of
minutes, so let's just do the 360.

1501
01:17:30,996 --> 01:17:34,399
我們會帶出一個無線
相機我們從松下偷走。
We're gonna bring out a wireless
camera we stole from Panasonic.

1502

我會告訴你這是什麼樣子。
I'll show you what this looks like.

1503
01:17:37,536 --> 01:17:40,438
整個事情是半透明的。
你可以看進去。
The whole thing is translucent.
You can see into it.

1504
01:17:40,439 --> 01:17:42,975
是如何形成的一種妥協，沃茲？
How's that for a compromise, Woz?

1505
01:17:42,976 --> 01:17:46,544
- 你仍然無法進入，但你可以看到到它。
- 很公平。
- You still can't get into it, but you can see into it.
- Fair enough.

1506
01:17:46,545 --> 01:17:50,315

他們都是偉大的。
They're all great.

"that Silicon Valley's original dream
company is no longer somnambulant."

1522
01:18:35,394 --> 01:18:36,861
這是一個詞。 它的意思是「夢遊」。
It's a word. It means "sleepwalking."

1523
01:18:36,862 --> 01:18:40,499
史蒂夫？ 對不起。 我們要清楚
房子如果我們的時間會啟動。

為什麼沒有我們曾經睡在一起？
Why haven't we ever slept together?

1533
01:19:19,237 --> 01:19:21,106
我們不是在戀愛。 看。

1534
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:26,011
- 斯卡利。

我是認真的。
I meant it.

J.D.塞林格的目擊是
比約翰·斯卡利更常見。
Sightings of J.D. Salinger are
more common than John Sculley.

這是很好的了。
I wasn't being sarcastic.
It was nice of him.

- 沒有。
- Do you talk to him?
- No.

1542
01:19:50,135 --> 01:19:52,169

You haven't talked to him since '88?

1543

我會告訴你，如果我做到了。
I'd have told you if I did.

1544
01:19:54,706 --> 01:19:56,141
無所謂。
Doesn't matter.

1545
01:19:56,142 --> 01:19:57,476
我不希望人們
以為他們可以穿越我
I don't want people
thinking they can cross me

1546
01:19:57,477 --> 01:20:01,178
然後，繁榮15年
後來，我冷靜吧。
and then, boom, 15 years
later, I'm cool with it.

1547

我是開玩笑的。
I was kidding.

1548
01:20:04,183 --> 01:20:06,719
有什麼問題你今天早上？
What's wrong with you this morning?

1549

讓我們下車舞台。
Let's get off the stage.

現在是在色調的領導地位。「
"The only thing Apple's providing
now is leadership in colors."

1551

不用擔心這個。
Don't worry about it.

1552
01:20:16,461 --> 01:20:18,562
- 什麼是比爾·蓋茨都對我？
- 我不知道。
- What does Bill Gates have against me?
- I don't know.

1553
01:20:18,563 --> 01:20:21,466
你既出你的
頭腦。 聽我說。
You're both out of your
minds. Listen to me.

1554
01:20:21,467 --> 01:20:23,535
他放棄更好的了
學校比我退了。
He dropped out of a better
school than I dropped out of.

1555
01:20:23,536 --> 01:20:25,404
但是，他是一個工具包。 我會告訴你為什麼。
But he's a tool bag. I'll tell you why.

1556
01:20:25,405 --> 01:20:28,139
讓一切都與麗莎的權利。
Make everything all right with Lisa.

1557

你知道，喬安娜？ 邊界。

You've come to my apartment
at 1:00 AM and cleaned it.

1559

所以告訴我在哪裏的邊界。
So tell me where the boundary is.

1560
01:20:35,714 --> 01:20:37,649
那裏。 比方說，它的存在。
There. Let's say it's there.

1561
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:40,685
如果我給你一些真正的預測，
If I give you some real projections,

1562
01:20:40,686 --> 01:20:44,489
你能保證不
從舞台上重複呢？
will you promise not to
repeat them from the stage?

1563
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:47,526
你是什​​麼意思，「真正的預測」？
What do you mean, "real projections"?

1564
01:20:47,527 --> 01:20:51,495

- 保守的預測。
- What have you been giving me?
- Conservative projections.

1565
01:20:51,496 --> 01:20:53,130
市場一直在騙我？
Marketing's been lying to me?

1566
01:20:53,131 --> 01:20:56,802
我們一直在管理預期
所以，你不不。
We've been managing expectations
so that you don't not.

什麼是真正的預測？
What are the real projections?

我們要賣出一百萬
單元中的第一個90天。
We're gonna sell a million
units in the first 90 days.

20,000 a month after that.

1570
01:21:05,210 --> 01:21:06,611

你看？ 你等待足夠長的時間，並...
You see? You wait long enough and...

什麼是銷售收入，32％
What's more, 32% of the sales

打算去的人買
一個計算機首次。

a computer for the first time.

和12％的將要使用的人
一些Windows機器中。
And 12% are going to people using
some kind of Windows machine.

1575
01:21:19,491 --> 01:21:22,227
這就是比爾·蓋茨對付你。
That's what Bill Gates has against you.

1576
01:21:23,696 --> 01:21:27,066
而這將是銷售最快的
計算機的歷史。
And it'll be the fastest-selling
computer in history.

1577
01:21:28,433 --> 01:21:30,468
你帶公司
從生活配套回來
You brought the company
back from life support

和切割的產品線的70％。
and cutting 70% of the product line.

1580
01:21:35,775 --> 01:21:39,178
因此，史蒂芬，它結束了。
So, Steven, it's over.

1581
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:43,280
你會取勝。
You're gonna win.

1582
01:21:43,281 --> 01:21:47,384
- 這將是犯罪不享受這一刻。
- 我很享受它。
- It would be criminal not to enjoy this moment.

讓事情沒事了與麗莎。
Make things all right with Lisa.

1584
01:21:49,421 --> 01:21:51,655
- 你懂的...
- 加油。
- You know...
- Come on.

1585
01:21:51,656 --> 01:21:55,326
我不喜歡有少
隱私比其他人。
I don't like having less
privacy than other people have.

1586
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:58,896
- 是否被一名億萬富翁採取​​一些刺斷了嗎？
- 沒有。
- Does being a multi-billionaire take some of the sting off that?
- No.

1587
01:21:58,897 --> 01:22:02,133
- 所有麗莎沒有...
- 所有麗莎所做的就是給她的祝福。
- All Lisa did...
- All Lisa did was give her blessing.

1588

-  Chrisann賣掉了房子，...
- 和Lisa可以做什麼呢？
- Chrisann sold the house and...
- And Lisa could have done what?

1589
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:08,272
她應該如何阻止她
母親賣自己的房子？
How was she supposed to stop her
mother from selling her own house?

1590
01:22:08,273 --> 01:22:09,673
我買了他們兩個。
That I bought for the two of them.

1591
01:22:09,674 --> 01:22:11,008
她應該如何阻止她？
How was she supposed to stop her?

1592
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:14,612
清濁反對將有
一直在朝著正確的方向邁出的一步。
Voicing an objection would have
been a step in the right direction.

1593
01:22:14,613 --> 01:22:17,315
你不覺得你
有一個奇怪的過激反應
You don't think you're
having a bizarre overreaction

1594
01:22:17,316 --> 01:22:20,819
一個19歲的女孩讓
她的媽媽列出她自己的房子？
to a 19-year-old girl allowing
her mother to list her own house?

1595
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:22,053
她可能已經嘗試過。
She could've tried.

1596
01:22:22,054 --> 01:22:25,757
當時她應該阻止她
媽媽，那個特定的母親......
Was she supposed to stop her
mother, that particular mother...

1597
01:22:25,758 --> 01:22:28,826
她給Chrisann福娃賣
房子，她這樣做是為了刁難我。
She gave Chrisann her blessing to sell
the house and she did it to spite me.

1598
01:22:28,827 --> 01:22:32,864
我不在乎，如果她把一個
管炸彈在熱水器。
I don't care if she put a
pipe bomb in the water heater.

1599
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:35,667
你要修復它，現在。
You're going to fix it, now.

1600
01:22:35,668 --> 01:22:38,736
她一直怪怪的
個月。 她轉向了我。
She's been acting weird for
months. She's turned on me.

1601
01:22:38,737 --> 01:22:40,804
- 修好它。
- 什麼？
- Fix it.
- What the...

1602
01:22:40,805 --> 01:22:42,440
修復它，史蒂夫。
Fix it, Steve.

1603
01:22:42,441 --> 01:22:43,941
- 別緊張。
- 修復它，或者我不幹了。
- Take it easy.
- Fix it or I quit.

1604
01:22:43,942 --> 01:22:46,178
那個怎麼樣？ 我退出，
你不會再見到我了。
How about that? I quit,
and you never see me again.

1605
01:22:46,179 --> 01:22:48,114
那個怎麼樣？
How about that?

1606
01:22:49,581 --> 01:22:52,551
告訴我，今天早上有什麼地方弄錯了。
Tell me what's wrong with you this morning.

1607
01:22:52,552 --> 01:22:55,920
什麼是錯跟了我1​​9年。
What's been wrong with me for 19 years.

1608
01:22:57,889 --> 01:23:01,860
我是一個見證，我
告訴你，我已經串通一氣。
I've been a witness, and I
tell you, I've been complicit.

1609
01:23:03,362 --> 01:23:07,365
我愛你，史蒂夫。 你知道多少。
I love you, Steve. You know how much.

1610
01:23:07,366 --> 01:23:12,369
我愛你不在乎多少錢
人作出。 你在乎<I>什麼</i>他們做。
I love that you don't care how much money a
person makes. You care <i>what</i> they make.

1611
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:16,208
但是，你做什麼是不應該
成為你最好的部分。
But what you make isn't supposed
to be the best part of you.

1612
01:23:16,209 --> 01:23:18,810
當你是一個父親，
When you're a father,

1613
01:23:18,811 --> 01:23:21,413
那是什麼的應該
是您最好的部分。
that's what's supposed to
be the best part of you.

1614
01:23:21,414 --> 01:23:26,251
而且這引起了我二十年
痛苦，史蒂夫，這是給你的
And it's caused me two decades of
agony, Steve, that it is for you

1615
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,821
最不好。
the worst.

1616
01:23:30,822 --> 01:23:36,329
這是一個小東西。
這是一個非常小的事情。
It's a little thing.
It's a very small thing.

1617
01:23:37,495 --> 01:23:39,830
修好它。
Fix it.

1618
01:23:39,831 --> 01:23:45,236
現在修復它，或者你可以
與我聯繫，我的新工作...
Fix it now, or you can
contact me at my new job...

1619
01:23:45,237 --> 01:23:48,206
工作在任何地方我想要的。
working anywhere I want.

1620
01:23:49,709 --> 01:23:51,977
我不碰巧認為這是
一個小交易。 她知道...
I don't happen to think it is
a little deal. She knew that...

1621
01:23:51,978 --> 01:23:54,378
- 沒有。
- 我買的房子，兩個...
- No.
- I bought the house for the two of...

1622
01:23:54,379 --> 01:23:55,746
- 沒有。
- 你是什麼意思，「不」？
- No.
- What do you mean, "no"?

1623
01:23:55,747 --> 01:24:00,884
我的意思是沒有。 房子有什麼
做你為什麼生氣麗莎。
I mean no. The house has nothing
to do with why you're angry at Lisa.

1624
01:24:00,885 --> 01:24:03,887
我向你保證，房子什麼都有
做我為什麼生氣麗莎。
I assure you, the house has everything
to do with why I'm angry at Lisa.

1625
01:24:03,888 --> 01:24:08,560
你有沒有聽說過這句話
「現實扭曲場」？
Have you ever heard the phrase
"reality distortion field"?

1626
01:24:08,561 --> 01:24:12,731
- 是。
- 正如在「史蒂夫的現實扭曲場」？
- Yes.
- As in "Steve's reality distortion field"?

1627
01:24:12,732 --> 01:24:15,633
我聽說過它。 我讀過它。
它被傳唱給我的瓊貝茲。
I've heard it. I've read it.
It's been sung to me by Joan Baez.

1628
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:17,401
你叫什麼現實扭曲場，
What you call a reality distortion field,

1629
01:24:17,402 --> 01:24:19,704
我敢肯定你
一個誰創造了一句，
and I'm pretty sure you're
the one who coined the phrase,

1630
01:24:19,705 --> 01:24:21,740
- 是我們在這裏的原因。
- 我知道。
- is the reason we're here.
- I know that.

1631
01:24:21,741 --> 01:24:24,042
如果我換我的銀行賬戶一塊錢
If I traded in my bank account for a dollar

1632
01:24:24,043 --> 01:24:26,878
每次有人告訴我一些
是不可能的，我會出人頭地。
every time somebody told me something
was impossible, I'd come out ahead.

1633
01:24:26,879 --> 01:24:28,913
- 我知道這一點。
- 什麼問題？
- I know that too.
- What's the problem?

1634
01:24:28,914 --> 01:24:31,915
- 我的問題？ 這肯定不是房子。
- 喬，我...
- My problem? It sure isn't the house.
- Jo, I...

1635
01:24:31,916 --> 01:24:36,387
這是你告訴她你
沒有打算支付哈佛。
It's that you told her you
weren't going to pay for Harvard.

1636
01:24:36,388 --> 01:24:38,423
那個孩子。
That child.

1637
01:24:38,424 --> 01:24:40,825
那認真的，unironic孩子。
That earnest, unironic kid.

1638
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:42,826
她告訴你，我是不支付她的學費？
She told you I wasn't paying her tuition?

1639
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:45,496
我應該打你
很久以前沉重的東西。
I should have hit you with
something heavy a long time ago.

1640
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:48,033
麗莎告訴你我不支付她的學費？
Lisa told you I wasn't paying her tuition?

1641
01:24:48,034 --> 01:24:52,303
- 安迪告訴我。
- 哪一個？
- Andy told me that.
- Which one?

1642
01:24:52,304 --> 01:24:54,371
赫茨菲爾德。
Hertzfeld.

1643
01:24:54,372 --> 01:24:55,874
怎麼會赫茨菲爾德知道嗎？
How would Hertzfeld know?

1644
01:24:55,875 --> 01:24:59,910
他寫了哈佛做了檢查
25,000覆蓋學期。
He wrote Harvard a check for
25,000 to cover the semester.

1645
01:24:59,911 --> 01:25:02,847
你他媽的......他付了學費？
Are you fucking... He paid her tuition?

1646
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:05,717
難道這不正是你剛才問見他嗎？
Isn't that why you just asked to see him?

1647
01:25:05,718 --> 01:25:07,319
不，我要求看他的東西...
No, I asked to see him about something...

1648
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:10,722
你告訴她你是不是
要付學費？
Did you tell her you weren't
going to pay for college?

1649
01:25:10,723 --> 01:25:12,723
- 是的，因為...
- 你怎麼能這樣做呢？
- Yes, because...
- How could you do that?

1650
01:25:12,724 --> 01:25:15,959
因為她的母親，誰
也是她的房東...
Because her mother, who
is also her landlord...

1651
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,928
赫茨菲爾德？ 我咆哮。
Hertzfeld? I was ranting.

1652
01:25:17,929 --> 01:25:20,498
我只是，你知道...我是
說。 你認為我會...
I was just, you know... I was
talking. You think I would...

1653
01:25:20,499 --> 01:25:24,602
我生氣了，因為麗莎
試圖讓我反感，喬安娜。
I was pissed off because Lisa
was trying to piss me off, Joanna.

1654
01:25:24,603 --> 01:25:26,003
這是她的意圖。 我不知道...
That was her intent. I don't know...

1655
01:25:26,004 --> 01:25:28,572
你明明嚇得屁滾尿流了。
You obviously scared the hell out of her.

1656
01:25:28,573 --> 01:25:32,144
赫茨菲爾德寫了一張支票
哈佛，支付...
Hertzfeld wrote a check
to Harvard, pay for...

1657
01:25:33,345 --> 01:25:34,978
- 她在這兒了嗎？
- 我敢肯定，她是。
- Is she here yet?
- I'm sure she is.

1658
01:25:34,979 --> 01:25:37,348
你能有一個人把她帶回來？
Can you have someone bring her back?

1659
01:25:37,349 --> 01:25:39,084
是。
Yes.

1660
01:25:40,486 --> 01:25:42,421
謝謝。
Thank you.

1661
01:25:45,825 --> 01:25:47,559
你懂的，
You know,

1662
01:25:48,994 --> 01:25:50,695
奶奶總是對我說...
my grandmother always used to say to me...

1663
01:25:50,696 --> 01:25:53,131
我不給狗屎，楊朵。
I don't give a shit, Yentl.

1664
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:56,767
- 我會有人得到麗莎。
- 謝謝。
- I'll have someone get Lisa.
- Thank you.

1665
01:25:56,768 --> 01:25:59,036
如果你看到赫茨菲爾德...
And if you see Hertzfeld...

1666
01:25:59,037 --> 01:26:00,972
這是安迪。
It's Andy.

1667
01:26:00,973 --> 01:26:04,109
說曹操曹操的首席工程師。
Speak of the devil's chief engineer.

1668
01:26:04,110 --> 01:26:05,377
走。
Go.

1669
01:26:05,378 --> 01:26:07,412
進來。
Come on in.

1670
01:26:09,415 --> 01:26:11,383
你今天看上去很棒。
You look great today.

1671
01:26:11,384 --> 01:26:12,851
- 謝謝。
- 難道不是嗎？
- Thank you.
- Doesn't she?

1672
01:26:12,852 --> 01:26:16,488
她看起來棒極了。 總是這樣。 出去。
She looks fantastic. Always does. Get out.

1673
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:20,991
- 嗯，我想我知道為什麼我在這裏。
- 你做？
- Well, I think I know why I'm here.
- Do you?

1674
01:26:20,992 --> 01:26:21,726
史蒂夫...
Steve...

1675
01:26:21,727 --> 01:26:24,596
- 你送支票了嗎？
- 是。
- Did you send the check yet?
- Yes.

1676
01:26:24,597 --> 01:26:27,831
因此，哈佛得到了學費支票
從安迪·赫茲菲爾德支付麗莎？
So Harvard got a tuition check
from Andy Hertzfeld to pay for Lisa?

1677
01:26:27,832 --> 01:26:29,868
我不認為他們的外觀，小心翼翼。
I don't think they look that carefully.

1678
01:26:29,869 --> 01:26:32,771
我不認為他們會通知
檢查不是來自你。
I don't think they'd notice
the check didn't come from you.

1679
01:26:32,772 --> 01:26:35,673
關閉之一。 這是
幾乎令人尷尬的我。
Close one. This was
almost embarrassing for me.

1680
01:26:35,674 --> 01:26:37,609
我瞭解...
I understand how...

1681
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:39,177
我今天電匯你錢。
I'll wire you the money today.

1682
01:26:39,178 --> 01:26:42,746
我 - 我理解你的感受。
我道歉。 我願意。
I-I understand how you feel.
And I do apologize. I do.

1683
01:26:42,747 --> 01:26:45,016
但讓我告訴你我的想法。
But let me tell you my thinking.

1684
01:26:45,017 --> 01:26:47,685
我甚至不能想像一個適當的
比喻來形容你做了什麼。
I can't even think of an appropriate
analogy to describe what you did.

1685
01:26:47,686 --> 01:26:50,187
我知道你們會
修理東西。 你總是這樣。
I knew you guys would
fix things. You always do.

1686
01:26:50,188 --> 01:26:53,991
但在此期間，如果該錢不是
在那裏，她會想念學校的學期。
But in the meantime, if the money wasn't
there, she'd miss a semester of school.

1687
01:26:53,992 --> 01:26:57,728
- 是啊。
- 她不得不告訴她的朋友，為什麼。
- Yeah.
- And she'd have to tell her friends why.

1688
01:26:57,729 --> 01:27:00,197
而她需要的東西。 她需要的襪子。
And she needed things. She needed socks.

1689
01:27:00,198 --> 01:27:04,436
- 什麼？
- 這是冷在劍橋。 她需要溫暖的襪子。
- What?
- It's cold in Cambridge. She needed warm socks.

1690
01:27:04,437 --> 01:27:09,206
- 你給她的襪子？
- 好吧，我給她錢的襪子。
- You gave her socks?
- Well, I gave her money for socks.

1691
01:27:09,207 --> 01:27:12,509
你沒有得到臨時代理
自己作為她的中期。
You don't get to deputize
yourself as her interim.

1692
01:27:12,510 --> 01:27:14,945
你沒有得到重寫我的
決策。 你明白嗎？
You don't get to override my
decisions. Do you understand?

1693
01:27:14,946 --> 01:27:17,115
你沒有得到行動
就像你是她的父親。
You don't get to act
like you're her father.

1694
01:27:17,116 --> 01:27:19,683
必須有人來。
Somebody had to.

1695
01:27:19,684 --> 01:27:21,785
你剛才對我說什麼他媽的？
What the fuck did you just say to me?

1696
01:27:21,786 --> 01:27:25,656
我認識她，因為她6。
I've known her since she was six.

1697
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:27,859
我也考慮...
I also consider...

1698
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:33,130
Chrisann是我的朋友，外面什麼
你和我......我們的關係之外。
Chrisann's my friend, outside of what
you and I... outside of our relationship.

1699
01:27:33,131 --> 01:27:35,900
- 所以，你就像一個家庭顧問。
- 我是一個家庭的朋友。
- So you're like a family adviser.
- I'm a family friend.

1700
01:27:35,901 --> 01:27:38,602
那麼你可能知道，
Lisa的已經看到了治療。
Then you probably know that
Lisa's been seeing a therapist.

1701
01:27:38,603 --> 01:27:40,170
- 是啊。
- 很多年了。
- Yeah.
- For many years.

1702
01:27:40,171 --> 01:27:42,474
- 是啊。
- 如果沒有我的知識。
- Yeah.
- Without my knowledge.

1703
01:27:43,909 --> 01:27:45,776
這真的不是我的生意。
That really wasn't my business.

1704
01:27:45,777 --> 01:27:49,079
我被你迷住了
覺得是不是你的業務。
I'm fascinated by what you
think is and isn't your business.

1705
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:53,218
麗莎已經持續到
治療師和她喜歡它
Lisa's been going to a
therapist and she likes it

1706
01:27:53,219 --> 01:27:56,855
並會為你的愛和
Chrisann她一起去。
and would love for you and
Chrisann to go with her.

1707
01:27:56,856 --> 01:28:01,493
你知道的原因是因為你
在一個推薦的治療師。
And the reason you know that is because you're
the one that recommended the therapist.

1708
01:28:01,494 --> 01:28:03,561
嗯，我知道一個人。
Well, I know a guy.

1709
01:28:03,562 --> 01:28:07,466
不，我的意思是你是一個誰
建議她去看心理醫生。
No, I mean you're the one who
recommended that she see a therapist.

1710
01:28:08,634 --> 01:28:13,036
你知道嗎？ 這是前一段時間，
我不記得怎麼整...
You know what? It was a while ago,
and I don't remember how the whole...

1711
01:28:13,037 --> 01:28:16,106
你告訴Chrisann說
麗莎應該去看心理醫生。
You told Chrisann that
Lisa should see a therapist.

1712
01:28:16,107 --> 01:28:19,244
史蒂夫，你誣蔑。
這是一個完美的標準...
Steve, you're stigmatizing.
It's a perfectly norm...

1713
01:28:19,245 --> 01:28:21,612
不是...
It's not...

1714
01:28:21,613 --> 01:28:23,681
我的一點是，它如何能傷害？
My thing was, how can it hurt?

1715
01:28:23,682 --> 01:28:25,651
讓我們來看看。
Let's find out.

1716
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:28,151
Chrisann是我的朋友。
Chrisann is my friend.

1717
01:28:28,152 --> 01:28:31,522
- 什麼是你給的原因是什麼？
- 你意思是...
- What was the reason you gave?
- You mean...

1718
01:28:31,523 --> 01:28:35,660
什麼是你給Chrisann的原因
為什麼麗莎應該看到一個治療師？
What was the reason you gave Chrisann
why Lisa should see a therapist?

1719
01:28:35,661 --> 01:28:37,794
我不記得了。 我們
聊天，我說...
I don't remember. We
were talking and I said...

1720
01:28:37,795 --> 01:28:41,166
這幾乎是我剛才說的，
這當然不能傷害。
It's pretty much what I just said,
that it certainly couldn't hurt.

1721
01:28:42,634 --> 01:28:46,171
你不說，麗莎
需要一個強大的男性榜樣？
You didn't say that Lisa
needed a strong male role model?

1722
01:28:53,112 --> 01:28:54,680
我做到了。
I did.

1723
01:29:01,253 --> 01:29:06,659
我認為這是一個奇跡，她不劫財
銀行與共生解放軍。
I think it's a miracle she's not robbing
banks with the Symbionese Liberation Army.

1724
01:29:09,295 --> 01:29:14,331
我們沒有理由在
世界為什麼她應該是不錯的。
There's no reason in the
world why she should be nice.

1725
01:29:14,332 --> 01:29:16,535
但她。
But she is.

1726
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:23,641
所以我幫，因為必須有人來。
So I helped, because somebody had to.

1727
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:32,218
我將電匯錢給你，今天下午。
I'll wire the money to you this afternoon.

1728
01:29:43,963 --> 01:29:47,130
你在很久以前威脅我。
You threatened me a long time ago.

1729
01:29:47,131 --> 01:29:48,800
抱歉？
Sorry?

1730
01:29:50,835 --> 01:29:53,937
很久很久以前......你威脅我一次。
A long time ago... You threatened me once.

1731
01:29:53,938 --> 01:29:56,007
人們被吸引到人的天賦。
People are attracted to people with talent.

1732
01:29:56,008 --> 01:29:58,209
人們沒有它發現的威脅。
People without it find that threatening.

1733
01:29:58,210 --> 01:30:00,277
也許你應該去看心理醫生。
Maybe you should see a therapist.

1734
01:30:00,278 --> 01:30:02,879
當然不能傷害。
Certainly couldn't hurt.

1735
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,216
我的意思是你從字面上威脅我。
I meant you literally threatened me.

1736
01:30:05,217 --> 01:30:07,752
在弗林特，前右在Mac推出。
At Flint, right before the Mac launch.

1737
01:30:07,753 --> 01:30:10,053
我重新編譯。 我以前是
嘗試調試的聲音演示。
I was recompiling. I was
trying to debug the voice demo.

1738
01:30:10,054 --> 01:30:14,392
你說，如果我不能找到一個解決方案，
你叫我在觀眾面前。
You said if I couldn't find a solution,
you'd call me out in front of the audience.

1739
01:30:14,393 --> 01:30:16,861
- 難道它說「你好」？
- 它做了。
- Did it say "hello"?
- It did.

1740
01:30:16,862 --> 01:30:20,263
沒有必要感謝我。
No need to thank me.

1741
01:30:20,264 --> 01:30:24,067
你為什麼希望人們喜歡你？
Why do you want people to dislike you?

1742
01:30:24,068 --> 01:30:27,237
我不希望人們不喜歡我。
I don't want people to dislike me.

1743
01:30:27,238 --> 01:30:30,342
我無所謂是否他們不喜歡我。
I'm indifferent to whether they dislike me.

1744
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:34,847
既然沒關係，我一直有。
Since it doesn't matter, I always have.

1745
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:38,084
真？
Really?

1746
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:43,656
我一直很喜歡你
很多。 這太糟糕了。
I've always liked you
a lot. That's too bad.

1747
01:30:45,823 --> 01:30:48,693
- 敲'時間死了。
- 謝謝。
- Knock 'em dead.
- Thank you.

1748
01:31:10,381 --> 01:31:15,152
什麼是顯著的，什麼是
很難捉摸，但真正的，
What is remarkable, what's
hard to fathom but true,

1749
01:31:15,153 --> 01:31:21,494
是，對於給定的時鐘速率，PowerPC的
芯片快兩倍，奔騰II芯片。
is that for a given clock rate, a PowerPC
chip is twice as fast as a Pentium II chip.

1750
01:31:34,372 --> 01:31:36,541
換一種說法，
In other words,

1751
01:31:37,742 --> 01:31:40,277
一個266兆赫G3芯片
a 266 megahertz G3 chip

1752
01:31:40,278 --> 01:31:45,817
是快兩倍作為
266兆赫奔騰II。
is twice as fast as a
266 megahertz Pentium II.

1753
01:31:48,853 --> 01:31:53,124
或... 266 G3
Or... a 266 G3

1754
01:31:53,125 --> 01:31:57,227
等於大約500兆赫。
is equal to about 500 megahertz.

1755
01:31:57,228 --> 01:32:00,330
<I>你知道什麼是
巧合的是，麗莎？</i>
<i>Do you know what a
coincidence is, Lisa?</i>

1756
01:32:00,331 --> 01:32:02,999
看看<I>字節</i>
雜誌的字節標誌，
Take a look at <i>Byte</i>
magazine's Byte Marks,

1757
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,670
金本位制任何...
the gold standard for any...

1758
01:32:10,209 --> 01:32:13,646
進來。
Come in.

1759
01:32:16,482 --> 01:32:19,182
我派人進大堂。
I sent someone into the lobby.

1760
01:32:19,183 --> 01:32:21,017
- 他們發現了她，她...
- 她在哪？
- They found her, and she...
- Where is she?

1761
01:32:21,018 --> 01:32:23,887
她說她寧願不回來。
She said she'd rather not come back.

1762
01:32:23,888 --> 01:32:26,257
- 為什麼？
- 這是它。
- Why?
- That was it.

1763
01:32:26,258 --> 01:32:29,259
- 我會在那裏我自己。
- 你不能。 你不能。
- I'm going out there myself.
- You can't. You can't.

1764
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:31,027
這將是一個場景出來的
<I>堅硬天的夜。</i>
It'll be a scene out of
<i>Hard Day's Night.</i>

1765
01:32:33,898 --> 01:32:36,267
- 打擾一下。
- 嘿，喬爾。
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Joel.

1766
01:32:36,268 --> 01:32:38,102
安迪說，這是好回來。
Andy said it was okay to come back.

1767
01:32:38,103 --> 01:32:40,739
- 哪一個？
安迪 - 坎寧安。
- Which one?
- Andy Cunningham.

1768
01:32:41,839 --> 01:32:44,808
我不能這樣做下去。 我需要
其中一人改變他們的名字。
I can't do this forever. I need
one of them to change their name.

1769
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:46,910
你叫安迪·坎寧安「安德烈。」
You call Andy Cunningham "Andrea."

1770
01:32:46,911 --> 01:32:48,311
不要緊，我給他們打電話。
It doesn't matter what I call them.

1771
01:32:48,312 --> 01:32:50,047
我知道是誰我說
對我說話的時候。
I know who I'm talking
about when I'm talking.

1772
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:51,915
我需要其他人來
稱他們為不同的名稱。
I need everyone else to
call them different names.

1773
01:32:51,916 --> 01:32:53,952
給我一秒鐘。
Give me one second.

1774
01:32:58,223 --> 01:33:00,792
你可以去讓她給我，好嗎？
Can you go get her for me, please?

1775
01:33:00,793 --> 01:33:02,459
我剛才談到安迪。
I just talked to Andy.

1776
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:04,227
赫茨菲爾德。
Hertzfeld.

1777
01:33:04,228 --> 01:33:07,464
我只是想洗刷本
我的大腦Drano的。
I'm just trying to scrub this
out of my brain with Drano.

1778
01:33:07,465 --> 01:33:09,866
但我想告訴麗莎。
But I do want to talk to Lisa.

1779
01:33:09,867 --> 01:33:12,402
好。 只是...
Okay. Just...

1780
01:33:12,403 --> 01:33:14,706
- 保持冷靜。
- 好。
- Stay cool.
- Okay.

1781
01:33:17,009 --> 01:33:18,744
謝謝。
Thank you.

1782
01:33:26,285 --> 01:33:28,019
嘿，史蒂夫。
Hey, Steve.

1783
01:33:40,464 --> 01:33:43,834
- 你感覺怎麼樣？
- 我感覺很好，喬爾。 你呢？
- How are you feeling?
- I'm feeling good, Joel. How about you?

1784
01:33:43,835 --> 01:33:46,503
我不認為我能在你的
商業。 它變化太快。
I don't think I could be in your
business. It changes too quickly.

1785
01:33:46,504 --> 01:33:49,841
好吧，我會死守，'你的事業即將
開始改變很快了。
Well, I'd hang on, 'cause yours is about
to start changing pretty quickly too.

1786
01:33:49,842 --> 01:33:53,009
這是在14第三次
多年來我寫你。
This is the third time in 14
years I'm writing about you.

1787
01:33:53,010 --> 01:33:56,414
你怎麼這麼遠覺得呢？
What do you think so far?

1788
01:33:56,415 --> 01:34:00,183
打擾一下。 Avie將的期待
為你。 他有一個新的鯊魚。
Excuse me. Avie's looking
for you. He has a new shark.

1789
01:34:00,184 --> 01:34:02,655
- 你要來後台一秒鐘？
- 當然。
- You wanna come backstage for a second?
- Sure.

1790
01:34:05,957 --> 01:34:09,160
- 這是誰呢？
- 阿蘭·圖靈。
- Who's this one?
- Alan Turing.

1791
01:34:09,161 --> 01:34:12,896
憑一己之力贏得了第二次世界大戰，
安可，發明了計算機。
Single-handedly won World War II and,
for an encore, invented the computer.

1792
01:34:12,897 --> 01:34:15,098
- 他會不會是運動的一部分，雖然。
- 為什麼不呢？
- He won't be part of the campaign though.
- Why not?

1793
01:34:15,099 --> 01:34:17,535
因為你剛剛問我他是誰。
'Cause you just had to ask me who he was.

1794
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:20,838
我能看到新的鯊魚？
Can I see new shark?

1795
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:25,543
我喜歡它比老的人好得多。
I like it better than the old shark.

1796
01:34:25,544 --> 01:34:27,178
- 鯊魚。
- 鯊魚。
- Sharks.
- Sharks.

1797
01:34:27,179 --> 01:34:29,079
- 有多少鯊魚你辦理什麼手續？
- 一對夫婦。
- How many sharks did you go through?
- A couple.

1798
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:32,883
- 這是第39屆。
- 我們記錄在案。
- This is the 39th.
- We're on the record.

1799
01:34:32,884 --> 01:34:35,553
- 三十九鯊魚。
- 好。
- Thirty-nine sharks.
- Okay.

1800
01:34:35,554 --> 01:34:37,621
- 你知道什麼是特別的這條鯊魚？
- 什麼？
- You know what's special about this shark?
- What?

1801
01:34:37,622 --> 01:34:42,293
不，我要問的，因為它看起來
酷似等38個鯊魚給我。
No, I'm really asking, because it looks
exactly like the other 38 sharks to me.

1802
01:34:42,294 --> 01:34:44,294
讓我看看它與
果然不出所料，從輪廓。
Let me see it with the
cue, from the profile.

1803
01:34:44,295 --> 01:34:46,163
這是提示92-B。
This is cue 92-B.

1804
01:34:46,164 --> 01:34:50,368
這是一個配置文件在這裏，這
是什麼樣子的了。
This is a profile here, and this
is what it looks like from the back.

1805
01:34:50,369 --> 01:34:55,172
還有一件事。 它吃
奔騰筆記本電腦作為一種小吃。
And one more thing. It eats
Pentium notebooks as a light snack.

1806
01:34:55,173 --> 01:34:58,241
這是鯊魚。
This is the shark.

1807
01:34:58,242 --> 01:35:00,511
我很喜歡。
I really like it.

1808
01:35:00,512 --> 01:35:02,312
沒有人得到它在第一時間，
Nobody gets it right the first time,

1809
01:35:02,313 --> 01:35:04,915
但我已被證明
這條鯊魚15，20年前的魚。
but I should have been shown
this shark 15, 20 fish ago.

1810
01:35:04,916 --> 01:35:06,616
- 你可能是。
- 鎖入。
- You probably were.
- Lock it in.

1811
01:35:06,617 --> 01:35:08,451
10分鐘。
Ten minutes.

1812
01:35:08,452 --> 01:35:12,956
他通過採取咬自殺身亡
一個毒蘋果......阿蘭·圖靈。
He killed himself by taking a bite
of a poison apple... Alan Turing.

1813
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:14,091
是啊。
Yeah.

1814
01:35:14,092 --> 01:35:16,694
應該有這個人的雕像。
There should be statues of that man.

1815
01:35:16,695 --> 01:35:19,062
他的名字應該在
學生的嘴唇。
His name should be on the
lips of schoolchildren.

1816
01:35:19,063 --> 01:35:22,633
七彩虹戰旗蘋果咬一口
取出來......那是哪裏來的？
The rainbow flag apple with a bite
taken out... That's where it came from?

1817
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:25,503
不，我們把它撿起掉名單
友好的冠冕堂皇的話。
No, we picked it off a list
of friendly-sounding words.

1818
01:35:25,504 --> 01:35:28,472
但不會是巨大的，如果是
曾背後的故事嗎？
But wouldn't it be great if that
had been the story behind it?

1819
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:32,075
史蒂夫。 挺喜歡過去的鯊魚。
Steve. Kinda liked the last shark.

1820
01:35:32,076 --> 01:35:34,011
你他媽的。
Fuck you.

1821
01:35:34,012 --> 01:35:35,612
我想請你幫個忙。
I wanted to ask you a favor.

1822
01:35:35,613 --> 01:35:36,813
我的朋友，很久以前，
My friend, a long time ago,

1823
01:35:36,814 --> 01:35:39,583
你之前問我一個忙
產品推出，我說沒有。
you asked me a favor before a
product launch, and I said no.

1824
01:35:39,584 --> 01:35:42,018
- 你想讓我承認...
- 不掛斷。
- You wanted me to acknowledge...
- Hang on.

1825
01:35:42,019 --> 01:35:46,289
如果你正要說你錯了，
我要準備這個記者。
If you're about to say you were wrong,
I want to prepare this journalist.

1826
01:35:46,290 --> 01:35:50,628
我是100％正確的，而你
是大錯特錯。
I was 100% right, and you
were spectacularly wrong.

1827
01:35:50,629 --> 01:35:53,129
但是，我還欠你一個人情，所以命名。
But I still owe you a favor, so name it.

1828
01:35:53,130 --> 01:35:54,697
史蒂夫...
Steve...

1829
01:35:54,698 --> 01:35:59,369
- 它不能承認的Apple II團隊。
- 確認蘋果II團隊。
- It can't be acknowledging the Apple II team.
- Acknowledge the Apple II team.

1830
01:35:59,370 --> 01:36:01,172
- 如何在私人？
- 沒有。
- How about in private?
- No.

1831
01:36:01,173 --> 01:36:02,606
- 這是一個惡作劇？
- 沒有。
- Is this a prank?
- No.

1832
01:36:02,607 --> 01:36:04,741
我試圖記住
一個300兆赫G3芯片...
I'm trying to remember that
a 300 megahertz G3 chip...

1833
01:36:04,742 --> 01:36:07,012
就在頂級球員。
Just the top guys.

1834
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:11,082
史蒂夫。
Steve.

1835
01:36:14,119 --> 01:36:15,686
- 請原諒我，好嗎？
- 是的。
- Excuse me, okay?
- Yep.

1836
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:18,188
一秒。
One second.

1837
01:36:20,692 --> 01:36:25,096
- 她說，她寧願不要。
- 什麼意思？
- She said she'd rather not.
- What do you mean?

1838
01:36:25,097 --> 01:36:28,432
她坐在她的朋友，
她說她寧願不回來。
She's sitting with her friends, and
she said she'd rather not come back.

1839
01:36:28,433 --> 01:36:30,433
好。 告訴她......把她放在一邊。
Okay. Tell her... Take her aside.

1840
01:36:30,434 --> 01:36:32,436
我不想為難
她在她的朋友面前。
I don't want to embarrass
her in front of her friends.

1841
01:36:32,437 --> 01:36:34,672
不過，告訴她，我只是害怕
狗屎了安迪，
But tell her I just scared
the shit out of Andy,

1842
01:36:34,673 --> 01:36:37,209
而這一次，沒有人是
她支付他媽的...
and this time, nobody's
paying her fucking...

1843
01:36:38,477 --> 01:36:40,544
好吧。 別這麼說。
All right. Don't say that.

1844
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:43,146
但是，做你的事，其中
你的聲音聽起來古老而智慧
But do your thing where
you sound old and wise

1845
01:36:43,147 --> 01:36:46,417
由於廣泛的，悲慘
你生活的歐洲油畫。
because of the broad, tragic
European canvas of your life.

1846
01:36:46,418 --> 01:36:49,285
你知道我不是出生在一個
19世紀shtetl，對不對？
You know I wasn't born in a
19th-century shtetl, right?

1847
01:36:49,286 --> 01:36:51,454
請告訴她，這是非常重要的。
Please tell her it's important.

1848
01:36:51,455 --> 01:36:54,025
- 一切都好？
- 是啊。
- Everything all right?

- 有些人在這裏，人...
- 我知道。
- There are people around here, man...

1850
01:36:55,626 --> 01:36:59,562
- 包括新聞中的一員。
- 我看見了他。
- Including a member of the press.
- I see him.

1851
01:36:59,563 --> 01:37:00,664
沃茲。
Woz.

1852
01:37:00,665 --> 01:37:03,936
就在頂級球員，那些
誰是被解雇。
Just the top guys, the ones
who are getting laid off.

1853
01:37:05,137 --> 01:37:07,405
聽，好嗎？
Listen, okay?

1854
01:37:07,406 --> 01:37:12,343
去年，蘋果公司失去了十億美元。
Last year, Apple lost one billion dollars.

1855
01:37:12,344 --> 01:37:14,311
我甚至不知道這是可能的。
I don't even know how that's possible.

1856
01:37:14,312 --> 01:37:16,780
你均小於90
被破產天。
You were less than 90
days from being insolvent.

1857
01:37:16,781 --> 01:37:19,583
我有三個不同的會計師
試圖解釋給我聽。
I had three different accountants
try to explain it to me.

1858
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:22,585
整個地方已被精簡。
The whole place has to be streamlined.

1859
01:37:22,586 --> 01:37:25,188
- 先從兩個會計師。
- 我開始與...
- Start with two of the accountants.
- I started with the...

1860
01:37:25,189 --> 01:37:28,225
- 喬爾，你能來台下？ 我們要去後台。
- 別管他那裏。
- Joel, could you come offstage? We're gonna go backstage.
- Leave him right there.

1861
01:37:28,226 --> 01:37:32,596
我開始通過Apple II團隊
因為我們不這樣了。
I started with the Apple II team
because we don't make that anymore.

1862
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:36,333
- 只要承認的頂級球員。
- 有一個含羞草和放鬆。
- Just acknowledge the top guys.
- Have a mimosa and relax.

1863
01:37:36,334 --> 01:37:38,835
你不會放我鴿子，現在，史蒂夫。
You will not blow me off right now, Steve.

1864
01:37:38,836 --> 01:37:41,605
- 頂級球員應得的...
- 有沒有頂級球員。
- The top guys deserve...
- There are no top guys.

1865
01:37:41,606 --> 01:37:44,208
好吧？ 在Apple II
團隊，沒有頂級球員。
All right? On the Apple II
team, there are no top guys.

1866
01:37:44,209 --> 01:37:47,645
他們是「B」的玩家，而「B」
隊員勸阻了「A」的球員。
They're "B" players, and "B"
players discourage the "A" players.

1867
01:37:47,646 --> 01:37:49,612
我想「A」的玩家在蘋果公司，而不是戴爾。
I want "A" players at Apple and not Dell.

1868
01:37:49,613 --> 01:37:52,348
他們不是「B」的玩家，和
我是一個好法官說。
They're not "B" players, and
I'm a better judge of that.

1869
01:37:52,349 --> 01:37:54,819
從破產不到90天，
Less than 90 days from insolvency,

1870
01:37:54,820 --> 01:37:58,588
部分原因是有人認為
牛頓是不是一箱垃圾。
in part because somebody thought
the Newton wasn't a box of garbage.

1871
01:37:58,589 --> 01:38:00,223
- 喬爾，你能來台下，好嗎？
- 離開他。
- Joel, could you come offstage, please?
- Leave him.

1872
01:38:00,224 --> 01:38:01,659
我說的...
I'm talking about...

1873
01:38:01,660 --> 01:38:04,261
你們的設計和出貨
垃圾的小盒子，而我走了。
You guys designed and shipped a
little box of garbage while I was gone.

1874
01:38:04,262 --> 01:38:05,728
我說的是蘋果II，
I'm talking about the Apple II,

1875
01:38:05,729 --> 01:38:08,531
這不僅是一個關鍵
這家公司的歷史的一部分，
which is not just a crucial
part of this company's history,

1876
01:38:08,532 --> 01:38:11,102
它是一個關鍵的部分
個人電腦的歷史。
it is a crucial part of the
history of personal computing.

1877
01:38:11,103 --> 01:38:12,770
一時間。
For a time.

1878
01:38:12,771 --> 01:38:15,371
至少你可以做的，如果你
要縮小這些人...
The least you can do, if you're
going to downsize these people...

1879
01:38:15,372 --> 01:38:18,174
他們會住在最大的房子
對任何人的失業線。
They're gonna live in the biggest houses
of anyone on the unemployment line.

1880
01:38:18,175 --> 01:38:22,480
是承認他們。 確認
他們這期間推出蘋果II。
Is to acknowledge them. Acknowledge
them and the Apple II during this launch.

1881
01:38:22,481 --> 01:38:24,048
這是一個新的動物。
This is a new animal.

1882
01:38:24,049 --> 01:38:28,185
這整個地方是由蘋果內置
二。 <I>您</i>是由蘋果二世建造。
This whole place was built by the Apple
II. <i>You</i> were built by the Apple II.

1883
01:38:28,186 --> 01:38:31,254
作為事實上，我被摧毀
由蘋果II和其開放系統
As a matter of fact, I was destroyed
by the Apple II and its open system

1884
01:38:31,255 --> 01:38:33,124
使黑客和愛好者
so that hackers and hobbyists

1885
01:38:33,125 --> 01:38:36,593
能建造火腿收音機什麼的。
could build ham radios or something.

1886
01:38:36,594 --> 01:38:38,395
然後它幾乎摧毀蘋果
And then it nearly destroyed Apple

1887
01:38:38,396 --> 01:38:40,431
當你花了所有的錢，就可以了
when you spent all your money on it

1888
01:38:40,432 --> 01:38:43,700
並制定了宏偉的
總沒有新的產品。
and developed a grand
total of no new products.

1889
01:38:43,701 --> 01:38:45,669
- 牛頓。
- 垃圾的小盒子。
- The Newton.
- The little box of garbage.

1890
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:49,775
你們想出了牛頓。
你希望人們知道嗎？
You guys came up with the Newton.
You want people to know that?

1891
01:38:51,675 --> 01:38:55,146
這是一個產品的推出，不是一個午餐會。
This is a product launch, not a luncheon.

1892
01:38:55,147 --> 01:38:57,248
我想過去的事情
做的是連接iMac電腦...
The last thing I want to
do is connect the iMac to...

1893
01:38:57,249 --> 01:39:00,217
為唯一中標產品
該公司已經做過。
To the only successful product
that this company has ever made.

1894
01:39:00,218 --> 01:39:03,654
我很抱歉，說白了，但
出現這種情況是事實。
I'm sorry to be blunt, but
that happens to be the truth.

1895
01:39:03,655 --> 01:39:07,624
麗莎是一個失敗。
在Macintosh上是失敗的。
The Lisa was a failure.
The Macintosh was a failure.

1896
01:39:07,625 --> 01:39:09,692
我不喜歡這樣說話，
I don't like talking like this,

1897
01:39:09,693 --> 01:39:14,431
但我厭倦了
林戈當我知道我是約翰。
but I am tired of being
Ringo when I know I was John.

1898
01:39:14,432 --> 01:39:15,833
每個人都喜歡林檎。
Everybody loves Ringo.

1899
01:39:15,834 --> 01:39:18,903
而我已經厭倦了被光顧你。
And I'm tired of being patronized by you.

1900
01:39:20,705 --> 01:39:23,339
你認為約翰成為約翰
贏得了抽獎活動，沃茲？
You think John became John
by winning a raffle, Woz?

1901
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:24,708
你覺得他欺騙了別人
You think he tricked somebody

1902
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:27,311
或打喬治·哈里森的頭？
or hit George Harrison over the head?

1903
01:39:27,312 --> 01:39:29,245
他是約翰，因為他是約翰。
He was John because he was John.

1904
01:39:29,246 --> 01:39:33,584
他是約翰，因為他寫道：「門票
乘坐。「我寫了蘋果II。
He was John 'cause he wrote "Ticket
to Ride." And I wrote the Apple II.

1905
01:39:33,585 --> 01:39:37,122
- 每個人？ 我想清楚了觀眾席。
- 沒有人移動。
- Everybody? I want to clear the auditorium.
- Nobody moves.

1906
01:39:39,456 --> 01:39:41,292
你做了一個漂亮的板，
You made a beautiful board,

1907
01:39:41,293 --> 01:39:43,427
其中，順便說一句，你是
願意給予了免費，
which, by the way, you were
willing to give out for free,

1908
01:39:43,428 --> 01:39:45,495
所以，不要告訴我你是怎麼建的蘋果。
so don't tell me how you built Apple.

1909
01:39:45,496 --> 01:39:47,897
如果不是因為我，你會是
最簡單的「A」在宅基高中。
If it weren't for me, you'd be the
easiest "A" at Homestead High School.

1910
01:39:47,898 --> 01:39:52,203
這些人生活和死亡您
讚美，所以這裏是你的機會。
These people live and die by your
praise, so here's your chance.

1911
01:39:52,204 --> 01:39:57,241
承認了好事發生
你是不是在房間裏。
Acknowledge that something good happened
that you weren't in the room for.

1912
01:40:00,378 --> 01:40:02,612
- 沒有。
- 史蒂夫。
- No.
- Steve.

1913
01:40:02,613 --> 01:40:07,184
做到這一點。 這是正確的。 其...
Do it. It's right. It's...

1914
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:10,353
這是正確的。
It's right.

1915
01:40:10,354 --> 01:40:12,489
對不起，不行。
Sorry, but no.

1916
01:40:12,490 --> 01:40:15,892
然後讓我換一種方式。
Then let me put it another way.

1917
01:40:15,893 --> 01:40:18,795
我不認為有一個男人
誰在做更多的推動
I don't think there's a man
who's done more to advance

1918
01:40:18,796 --> 01:40:22,333
自帶民主化
與個人電腦比我有，
the democratization that comes
with personal computing than I have,

1919
01:40:22,334 --> 01:40:23,901
但你從來沒有給我任何的尊重。
but you've never had any respect for me.

1920
01:40:23,902 --> 01:40:26,004
現在，這是為什麼？
Now why is that?

1921
01:40:27,272 --> 01:40:28,638
我想至少要考慮的可能性
I'd at least consider the possibility

1922
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:30,673
這是因為你
從來沒有什麼我。
that it's because you've
never had any for me.

1923
01:40:32,978 --> 01:40:34,712
這到底是怎麼回事？
What the hell is going on here?

1924
01:40:34,713 --> 01:40:38,183
什麼也沒有。 感謝您的時間。
Nothing. Thank you for your time.

1925
01:40:41,686 --> 01:40:44,788
搞定了。 她回來了。
It's done. She's coming back.

1926
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:47,358
您可以從將來到一個半英吋
這家公司倒閉。
You came a half-inch from putting
this company out of business.

1927
01:40:48,927 --> 01:40:51,162
現在誰我看到了嗎？
Now who do I see about that?

1928
01:40:52,296 --> 01:40:54,498
我讓你保持你的工作。
I'm letting you keep your job.

1929
01:40:54,499 --> 01:40:56,902
你得到了一通。
You get a pass.

1930
01:40:59,403 --> 01:41:00,803
你知道，當人們常常問我
You know, when people used to ask me

1931
01:41:00,804 --> 01:41:03,374
什麼不同
我和史蒂夫·喬布斯之間，
what the difference was
between me and Steve Jobs,

1932
01:41:03,375 --> 01:41:06,477
我會說史蒂夫是大畫面的傢伙
I would say Steve was the big-picture guy

1933
01:41:06,478 --> 01:41:08,411
我喜歡上了一個堅實的工作台。
and I liked a solid workbench.

1934
01:41:08,412 --> 01:41:10,414
當人們問我什麼
所不同的是現在，
When people ask me what
the difference is now,

1935
01:41:10,415 --> 01:41:12,850
我說：「史蒂夫是一個混蛋。」
I say "Steve's an asshole."

1936
01:41:12,851 --> 01:41:15,652
你的產品有更好的
比你，兄弟。
Your products are better
than you are, brother.

1937
01:41:15,653 --> 01:41:18,621
這就是這個想法，兄弟。
That's the idea, brother.

1938
01:41:18,622 --> 01:41:22,459
而且知道，這就是區別。
And knowing that, that's the difference.

1939
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:25,462
這不是二進制。
It's not binary.

1940
01:41:25,463 --> 01:41:29,034
你可以體面的，
優同時。
You can be decent and
gifted at the same time.

1941
01:41:50,722 --> 01:41:52,856
他不是故意的。
He didn't mean it.

1942
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:54,960
是的，他做到了。
Yeah, he did.

1943
01:41:57,429 --> 01:41:59,397
他是一個喜怒無常的傢伙。
He's a temperamental guy.

1944
01:42:00,598 --> 01:42:02,300
不，他不是。
No, he's not.

1945
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:09,505
這到五分鐘，每發射前，
It's like five minutes before every launch,

1946
01:42:09,506 --> 01:42:13,677
每個人都去酒吧，喝醉
並告訴我，他們的真實想法。
everyone goes to a bar, gets drunk
and tells me what they really think.

1947
01:42:13,678 --> 01:42:16,414
她來到你的更衣室。
She's coming to your dressing room.

1948
01:42:27,025 --> 01:42:29,426
我告訴你做的事
所有的權利與莉薩。
I told you to make things
all right with Lisa.

1949
01:42:29,427 --> 01:42:32,730
我並沒有說你必須解決
每血海深仇你。
I didn't say you had to settle
every blood feud you have.

1950
01:42:32,731 --> 01:42:36,767
上次血仇沒有解決，
我失去了<I>封面時間。</i>
Last time blood feuds weren't settled,
I lost the cover of <i>Time.</i>

1951
01:42:36,768 --> 01:42:40,471
雖然我用我的生命，我仍然不知道
什麼是地獄丹科特肯是生我的氣的。
Though for the life of me, I still don't know
what the hell Dan Kottke was mad at me about.

1952
01:42:40,472 --> 01:42:43,139
- 科特肯沒有失去你的<I>封面時間</i>
- 當然，他做​​到了。
- Kottke didn't lose you the cover of <i>Time.</i>
- Of course he did.

1953
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:45,776
你願意讓我來證明
你的能力是錯誤​​的
Would you like me to demonstrate
your capacity to be wrong

1954
01:42:45,777 --> 01:42:47,378
當你確定你是對的？
when you're certain you're right?

1955
01:42:47,379 --> 01:42:49,847
丹科特肯告訴<I>時間</i>
雜誌，我被拒絕...
Dan Kottke told <i>Time</i>
magazine that I was denying...

1956
01:42:49,848 --> 01:42:51,615
你還記得的封面？
Do you remember the cover?

1957
01:42:51,616 --> 01:42:53,150
- 系統<i>時間</i>
- 是。
- Of <i>Time?</i>
- Yes.

1958
01:42:53,151 --> 01:42:54,918
- 是。
- 它以前如何？
- Yes.
- What was it?

1959
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:56,986
- 你在說什麼？
- 什麼是在封面上？
- What are you talking about?
- What was on the cover?

1960
01:42:56,987 --> 01:42:58,588
- 一台電腦。
- 沒有。
- A computer.
- No.

1961
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:00,990
這是一台電腦的雕塑。
It was a sculpture of a computer.

1962
01:43:00,991 --> 01:43:03,561
這是一個雕塑。
It was a sculpture.

1963
01:43:04,696 --> 01:43:07,865
<I>時間</i>將不得不有
提前委託它個月。
<i>Time</i> would have had to have
commissioned it months in advance.

1964
01:43:07,866 --> 01:43:10,066
你從來沒有在
對話為年度人物。
You were never in the
conversation for Man of the Year.

1965
01:43:10,067 --> 01:43:11,768
沒有人失去了你什麼。
Nobody lost you anything.

1966
01:43:11,769 --> 01:43:13,637
<I>圖片我和Mac。的</i>
<i>Picture of me and the Mac.</i>

1967
01:43:13,638 --> 01:43:16,673
那麼還有什麼是你確定？
So what else are you sure about?

1968
01:43:16,674 --> 01:43:19,575
我不知道我怎麼可能已經錯過了。
I don't know how I could've missed that.

1969
01:43:19,576 --> 01:43:21,611
- 現實扭曲。
- 不，嚴肅。
- Reality distortion.
- No, seriously.

1970
01:43:21,612 --> 01:43:22,812
認真。
Seriously.

1971
01:43:22,813 --> 01:43:25,615
不要試圖贏得麗莎的參數。
Don't try to win an argument with Lisa.

1972
01:43:25,616 --> 01:43:28,752
只要說你錯了。
Just say you were wrong.

1973
01:43:28,753 --> 01:43:30,856
來吧，親愛的。
Come on in, honey.

1974
01:43:31,889 --> 01:43:34,424
- 這不是「蜜」。
- 約翰。
- It's not "honey."
- John.

1975
01:43:34,425 --> 01:43:36,627
進去。進去，走出了大廳。
Get in. Get in. Get out of the hall.

1976
01:43:36,628 --> 01:43:38,061
我被帶到一個側門。
I was taken in a side entrance.

1977
01:43:38,062 --> 01:43:39,963
我會去出同
方法。 沒有人會看到我。
I'll go out the same
way. No one will see me.

1978
01:43:39,964 --> 01:43:42,566
- 你怎麼樣，喬安娜？
- 我很好，約翰。
- How are you, Joanna?
- I'm good, John.

1979
01:43:42,567 --> 01:43:45,102
我只是驚訝地看到你。
I'm just surprised to see you.

1980
01:43:45,103 --> 01:43:47,704
每個人都在這裏真的很感謝
報價你給<I>福布斯。</i>
Everyone here really appreciates
the quote you gave to <i>Forbes.</i>

1981
01:43:47,705 --> 01:43:50,507
- 你沒有做到這一點。
- 我的榮幸。
- You didn't have to do that.
- My pleasure.

1982
01:43:50,508 --> 01:43:53,544
如果你願意，我可以滑您在
回一次家的燈光熄滅。
If you want, I can slip you in the
back once the house lights go out.

1983
01:43:53,545 --> 01:43:56,548
- 我只是這裏說的「好運氣」。
-  <I>好</i>
- I'm just here to say "good luck."
- <i>Okay.</i>

1984
01:43:57,915 --> 01:43:59,917
你只需要一兩分鐘。
You just have a couple of minutes.

1985
01:43:59,918 --> 01:44:02,254
- 你會嘗試找到...
- 是啊。
- Would you try to find...
- Yeah.

1986
01:44:06,457 --> 01:44:08,559
你是個好人，約翰。
You're a good man, John.

1987
01:44:20,905 --> 01:44:24,040
所以，我給你的禮物。
So I brought you a present.

1988
01:44:24,041 --> 01:44:25,709
一個牛頓。
A Newton.

1989
01:44:25,710 --> 01:44:31,514
不要把它開箱即用，你就可以
把它賣掉，這是比我能說的。
Don't take it out of the box, you'll be able
to sell it, which is more than I can say.

1990
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:33,484
一切都在那裏？
Everything all right there?

1991
01:44:33,485 --> 01:44:35,752
呃，不...
Uh, no...

1992
01:44:35,753 --> 01:44:38,754
只是一些喬安娜指給我看。
Just something Joanna pointed out to me.

1993
01:44:38,755 --> 01:44:42,025
我錯過了什麼那麼明顯有關...
I missed something so obvious about...

1994
01:44:42,026 --> 01:44:43,628
無所謂。
Doesn't matter.

1995
01:44:45,629 --> 01:44:49,098
你看，華爾街會坐下來
等著看你怎麼做的CEO，
Look, Wall Street's gonna sit back
and wait to see how you do as CEO,

1996
01:44:49,099 --> 01:44:51,968
所以不要讓任何波動
打擾你的頭12個月。
so don't let any fluctuation
bother you for the first 12 months.

1997
01:44:51,969 --> 01:44:54,472
當日交易者，因為我的回應。
Day traders are gonna respond.

1998
01:44:55,506 --> 01:44:57,409
我不需要上學你。
I don't need to school you.

1999
01:44:58,643 --> 01:45:00,843
這是你告訴我，我的方式
不應該殺了牛頓？
This your way of telling me I
shouldn't have killed the Newton?

2000
01:45:00,844 --> 01:45:05,281
最有效的動物
在這個星球上的禿鷹。
The most efficient animal
on the planet is the condor.

2001
01:45:05,282 --> 01:45:08,084
最沒有效率的動物
在這個星球上的人類。
The most inefficient animals
on the planet are humans.

2002
01:45:08,085 --> 01:45:10,853
好了，你不應該
殺害它雖然。
Well, you shouldn't
have killed it for spite.

2003
01:45:10,854 --> 01:45:14,290
這是不好的企業。 不要那樣做。
That's bad business. Don't do that.

2004
01:45:14,291 --> 01:45:19,663
但與自行車人
成為最有效的動物。
But a human with a bicycle
becomes the most efficient animal.

2005
01:45:19,664 --> 01:45:21,798
而正確的計算機...
And the right computer...

2006
01:45:21,799 --> 01:45:24,601
一個友好，易於計算機
這不是礙眼
a friendly, easy computer
that isn't an eyesore

2007
01:45:24,602 --> 01:45:29,071
而坐在你的辦公桌
張量燈的美女...
but rather sits on your desk with
the beauty of a Tensor lamp...

2008
01:45:29,072 --> 01:45:34,076
正確的計算機會
是一個自行車的想法。
The right computer will
be a bicycle for the mind.

2009
01:45:34,077 --> 01:45:36,679
你喜歡它嗎？
Do you like it?

2010
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:39,081
我回饋。
I was giving back.

2011
01:45:39,082 --> 01:45:43,219
而如果代替它
在右手之中，
And what if instead of it
being in the right hands,

2012
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:45,289
它是在每個人的手中？
it was in everyone's hands?

2013
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:47,392
每個人在世界上。
Everyone in the world.

2014
01:45:48,893 --> 01:45:51,962
我們會談論最多的構造
在轉移，因為現狀...
We'd be talking about the most tectonic
shift in the status quo since...

2015
01:45:51,963 --> 01:45:53,364
曾經。
Ever.

2016
01:45:53,365 --> 01:45:56,566
我不知道為什麼你一直都是
感興趣的我收養的歷史，
I don't know why you've always been
interested in my adoption history,

2017
01:45:56,567 --> 01:46:00,603
但你說這是不是像有人
看著我，給我回。
but you said it's not like someone
looked at me and gave me back.

2018
01:46:00,604 --> 01:46:02,039
但是，這是發生了什麼事。
But that is what happened.

2019
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:04,576
你告訴我你
有合適的電腦。
And you're telling me you
have the right computer.

2020
01:46:05,677 --> 01:46:07,977
這就是所謂的Macintosh。
It's called Macintosh.

2021
01:46:07,978 --> 01:46:10,713
律師夫婦收養了我第一次，
A lawyer couple adopted me first,

2022
01:46:10,714 --> 01:46:13,216
那麼一個月後給我回。
then gave me back after a month.

2023
01:46:13,217 --> 01:46:15,387
他們改變了主意。
They changed their mind.

2024
01:46:16,987 --> 01:46:19,690
然後，我的父母收養了我。
Then my parents adopted me.

2025
01:46:19,691 --> 01:46:22,258
我的親生母親
規定，凡帶我
My biological mother had
stipulated that whoever took me

2026
01:46:22,259 --> 01:46:25,795
必須是大專以上學歷，
富裕和天主教。
had to be college-educated,
wealthy and Catholic.

2027
01:46:25,796 --> 01:46:28,331
保羅和克拉拉喬布斯是
這些事，
Paul and Clara Jobs were
none of those things,

2028
01:46:28,332 --> 01:46:32,768
所以我的親生母親也不會
簽署的收養文件。
so my biological mother wouldn't
sign the adoption papers.

2029
01:46:32,769 --> 01:46:34,070
發生了什麼？
What happened?

2030
01:46:34,071 --> 01:46:37,607
有一個法律戰
這持續了一段時間。
There was a legal battle
that went on for a while.

2031
01:46:37,608 --> 01:46:40,877
我的母親說，她拒絕了
愛我的第一年。
My mother said she refused
to love me for the first year.

2032
01:46:40,878 --> 01:46:42,812
要知道，在情況下，他們只好給我回。
You know, in case they had to give me back.

2033
01:46:42,813 --> 01:46:45,816
你無法拒絕愛一個人，史蒂夫。
You can't refuse to love someone, Steve.

2034
01:46:45,817 --> 01:46:48,685
是啊，原來你可以。
Yeah, it turns out you can.

2035
01:46:48,686 --> 01:46:52,822
什麼是地獄可以了一個月之久的做
這是如此糟糕，他的父母給他回來嗎？
What the hell can a one-month-old do
that's so bad his parents give him back?

2036
01:46:52,823 --> 01:46:55,758
什麼也沒有。 什麼也沒有
一個個月大的可以做...
Nothing. There's nothing
a one-month-old can do...

2037
01:46:55,759 --> 01:46:59,029
你有沒有想過嘗試
找到你的親生父親？
Have you ever thought about trying
to find your biological father?

2038
01:46:59,030 --> 01:47:00,731
我見過我的親生父親。
I've met my biological father.

2039
01:47:00,732 --> 01:47:02,600
對於這個問題，所以有你。
For that matter, so have you.

2040
01:47:05,236 --> 01:47:07,070
這就是所謂的Macintosh。
It's called Macintosh.

2041
01:47:07,071 --> 01:47:09,740
- 史蒂夫·喬布斯先生。
- 詹達利。
- Mr. Steve Jobs.
- Jandali.

2042
01:47:09,741 --> 01:47:11,208
打個招呼約翰·斯卡利。
Say hello to John Sculley.

2043
01:47:11,209 --> 01:47:14,777
詹達利擁有的地方，
和約翰是百事可樂公司的首席執行官，
Jandali owns the place,
and John's the CEO of Pepsi,

2044
01:47:14,778 --> 01:47:18,382
<I>，但我試圖讓他搬到
庫比蒂諾，把宇宙中的一個凹痕。</i>
<i>but I'm trying to get him to move to
Cupertino, put a dent in the universe.</i>

2045
01:47:18,383 --> 01:47:20,182
你吃的素食主義者呢？
You eat vegan as well?

2046
01:47:20,183 --> 01:47:21,785
你在跟我開玩笑。
You're kidding me.

2047
01:47:21,786 --> 01:47:23,387
不，我會吃任何東西。
No, I'll eat anything.

2048
01:47:23,388 --> 01:47:27,356
你為什麼不與地中海開始
生菜沙拉，馬齒莧，薄荷...
Why don't you start off with the Mediterranean
lettuce salad with purslane, mint...

2049
01:47:27,357 --> 01:47:31,261
我的妹妹找到了他。
My sister found him.

2050
01:47:31,262 --> 01:47:33,664
- 他知道嗎？
- 不，事實上，他吹噓莫娜
- Does he know?
- No. In fact, he bragged to Mona

2051
01:47:33,665 --> 01:47:35,999
史蒂夫·喬布斯進來
餐廳所有的時間。
that Steve Jobs comes in
the restaurant all the time.

2052
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,935
- 你不想...
- 沒有。
- You don't want to...
- No.

2053
01:47:38,936 --> 01:47:41,840
<I>你不覺得你
應該跟他談談？</i>
<i>Don't you think you
should talk to him?</i>

2054
01:47:43,206 --> 01:47:46,209
他很可能找個理由來告我。
He'd probably find a reason to sue me.

2055
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:48,712
哦，史蒂夫...
Oh, Steve...

2056
01:47:48,713 --> 01:47:51,815
約翰，如果你在這裏對你的遺產，
John, if you're here about your legacy,

2057
01:47:51,816 --> 01:47:53,450
你需要形成背後沃茲尼亞克一條線。
you need to form a line behind Wozniak.

2058
01:47:53,451 --> 01:47:55,718
沃茲尼亞克的會沒事的。
Wozniak's gonna be fine.

2059
01:47:55,719 --> 01:47:58,922
我是誰開史蒂夫·喬布斯的人。
I'm the guy who fired Steve Jobs.

2060
01:47:58,923 --> 01:48:02,058
豐富，受過大學教育和天主教。
Rich, college-educated and Catholic.

2061
01:48:02,059 --> 01:48:06,330
史蒂夫？ 它的時間。
Steve? It's time.

2062
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:12,570
我得走。
I've gotta go.

2063
01:48:14,772 --> 01:48:18,376
難道我這樣做呢？ 搞砸了？
Did I do this? Screw it up?

2064
01:48:21,245 --> 01:48:23,381
讓我們現在讓他走了。
Let's let it go now.

2065
01:48:24,848 --> 01:48:26,750
必須的時間。
Has to be time.

2066
01:48:31,222 --> 01:48:33,758
快來成為我們的CEO。
Come be our CEO.

2067
01:48:34,991 --> 01:48:36,894
是啊。 好。
Yeah. Okay.

2068
01:48:45,335 --> 01:48:48,871
這是手寫筆，約翰。
It was the stylus, John.

2069
01:48:48,872 --> 01:48:52,942
- 什麼？
- 我殺了，因為手寫筆的牛頓。
- What?
- I killed the Newton because of the stylus.

2070
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:56,781
如果你拿著手寫筆，不能使用
其他五個連接到你的手腕了。
If you're holding a stylus, you can't use the
other five that are attached to your wrist.

2071
01:49:00,284 --> 01:49:02,487
我們可以一起做的事情。
Things we could have done together.

2072
01:49:07,825 --> 01:49:10,394
上帝，我們可能已經做過的事情。
God, the things we could've done.

2073
01:49:26,777 --> 01:49:28,244
我在為你付學費。
I'm paying your tuition.

2074
01:49:28,245 --> 01:49:30,446
你瘋了嗎？ 當然
我在為你付學費。
Are you crazy? Of course
I'm paying your tuition.

2075
01:49:30,447 --> 01:49:33,984
我一定是誤解你的時候
你說你不支付我的學費。
I must have misunderstood you when
you said you weren't paying my tuition.

2076
01:49:33,985 --> 01:49:36,453
你和你媽媽賣
房子是一個充滿敵意的事情。
You and your mom selling the
house was a hostile thing to do.

2077
01:49:36,454 --> 01:49:38,254
她需要錢。
She needed the money.

2078
01:49:38,255 --> 01:49:40,056
她總是需要錢。
She always needs the money.

2079
01:49:40,057 --> 01:49:44,127
她需要看醫生。 她
具有鼻竇感染。
She needs a doctor. She
has a sinus infection.

2080
01:49:44,128 --> 01:49:47,998
她有同樣的竇
感染自1988年以來。
She's had the same sinus
infection since 1988.

2081
01:49:47,999 --> 01:49:51,200
我要照顧我的母親。
我很抱歉，如果這激怒你。
I'm gonna take care of my mother.
I'm sorry if that angers you.

2082
01:49:51,201 --> 01:49:53,069
它激怒了我，因為你是一個孩子
It does anger me, because you're a kid

2083
01:49:53,070 --> 01:49:55,405
這不是你的工作，
照顧你的母親。
and it's not your job to
take care of your mother.

2084
01:49:55,406 --> 01:49:57,440
那是你是怎麼死的？
Is that how yours died?

2085
01:49:57,441 --> 01:50:01,477
夥計們，一步之遙，請，
給他們一些空間。
Guys, step away, please,
and give them some room.

2086
01:50:01,478 --> 01:50:04,481
當你的媽媽是90，不能養活自己，
When your mom is 90 and can't feed herself,

2087
01:50:04,482 --> 01:50:05,816
你可以照顧她。
you can take care of her.

2088
01:50:05,817 --> 01:50:11,320
但現在，她是45，完美
健康，不能養活自己。
But right now, she's 45, perfectly
healthy and can't feed herself.

2089
01:50:11,321 --> 01:50:14,524
你應該在努力工作，
學校是19，僅此而已。
You're supposed to work hard at
school and be 19, and that's it.

2090
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:17,494
- 我相信你的母親。
- 保持這種好的表現。
- I'll take care of your mother.
- Keep up the good work.

2091
01:50:17,495 --> 01:50:20,096
- 什麼是地獄，你想從我這裏？
- 我被送到了。
- What the hell do you want from me?
- I was sent for.

2092
01:50:20,097 --> 01:50:22,833
我給她買了房子$ 40萬元。
I bought her a house for $400,000.

2093
01:50:22,834 --> 01:50:24,567
值得一兩倍多的今天。
It's worth twice that much today.

2094
01:50:24,568 --> 01:50:27,036
她賣了兩件法寶
岩石和一碗湯。
She sold it for two magic
rocks and a bowl of soup.

2095
01:50:27,037 --> 01:50:28,471
這是她的家。
It was her house.

2096
01:50:28,472 --> 01:50:30,272
她用這筆錢
通過歐洲旅行。
She used that money to
travel through Europe.

2097
01:50:30,273 --> 01:50:32,107
錢，你讓她討要。
Money which you make her beg for.

2098
01:50:32,108 --> 01:50:34,244
- 史蒂夫...
- 甚至不著手行動。
- Steve...
- Don't even start with that.

2099
01:50:34,245 --> 01:50:36,279
要安迪和要求的錢？
Going to Andy and asking for the money?

2100
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:38,114
這是如此現成的圖表
過線？
That was so off-the-charts
over the line...

2101
01:50:38,115 --> 01:50:41,383
我沒有這樣做。 安迪來找我。
I did not do that. Andy came to me.

2102
01:50:41,384 --> 01:50:44,420
每個人都對這個評論？
Everybody have an opinion on this?

2103
01:50:44,421 --> 01:50:47,958
我很抱歉，夥計們。 在30秒內，
你要遲到了。
I'm sorry, guys. In 30 seconds,
you're going to be late.

2104
01:50:47,959 --> 01:50:51,861
她花的古董和再有錢
銷售他們的東西，她付出的一小部分，
She spends the money on antiques and then
sells them for a fraction of what she paid,

2105
01:50:51,862 --> 01:50:54,063
她做它用金錢
我給她給你。
and she does it with money
I gave to her for you.

2106
01:50:54,064 --> 01:50:55,464
史蒂夫...
Steve...

2107
01:50:55,465 --> 01:50:57,366
你來找我歇斯底里，當你13歲，
You came to me hysterical when you were 13,

2108
01:50:57,367 --> 01:50:59,268
- 問你是否能和我一起住？
- 我不是歇斯底里。
- asking if you could live with me...
- I was not hysterical.

2109
01:50:59,269 --> 01:51:01,003
因為你的媽媽
每天尖叫您。
Because your mom was
screaming at you every day.

2110
01:51:01,004 --> 01:51:03,138
十三是我第二次問你。
Thirteen was the second time I asked you.

2111
01:51:03,139 --> 01:51:04,874
她的生活壓力
作為一種精神治療師。
The stress of her life
as a spiritual healer.

2112
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:09,012
我不相信，我說你是一個
壞人。 但是，如果我這樣做，我很抱歉。
I don't believe I said you're a
bad guy. But if I did, I'm sorry.

2113
01:51:12,148 --> 01:51:14,618
嘿。 事情發生在你身上，在學校，
Hey. Something happened to you at school,

2114
01:51:14,619 --> 01:51:20,022
一些第一學期的核心類
所有新生都必須參加...
some first semester core class that
all freshmen are required to take...

2115
01:51:20,023 --> 01:51:22,892
- 我讀<I>時間</i>
- 什麼？
- I read <i>Time.</i>
- What?

2116
01:51:22,893 --> 01:51:26,495
我在學校上網。
我讀的舊副本<I>時，</i>
I have Internet access at school.
I read an old copy of <i>Time,</i>

2117
01:51:26,496 --> 01:51:30,299
我問我媽一些
關於我家庭的歷史問題。
and I asked my mom some
questions about my family history.

2118
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:32,067
這是...
That was...

2119
01:51:32,068 --> 01:51:34,169
<I>時間</i>寫了
錯位的一塊雜誌。
<i>Time</i> wrote a
mangled piece of journal.

2120
01:51:34,170 --> 01:51:35,571
你從來沒有要讀的。
You were never supposed to read that.

2121
01:51:35,572 --> 01:51:38,074
我有兩個不同的哈佛​​統計
I had two different Harvard statisticians

2122
01:51:38,075 --> 01:51:40,677
嘗試反向工程，
你想出方程
try to reverse-engineer the
equation that you came up with

2123
01:51:40,678 --> 01:51:44,446
證明美國的那28％
男人可能是我的父親。
to prove that 28% of American
men could be my father.

2124
01:51:44,447 --> 01:51:45,848
親愛的，我...
Honey, I...

2125
01:51:45,849 --> 01:51:49,652
你知道，我的母親可能是一個
陷入困境的女人，但什麼是你的借口？
You know, my mother might be a
troubled woman, but what's your excuse?

2126
01:51:49,653 --> 01:51:53,255
這就是為什麼我沒有留下深刻印象
與你的故事，爸爸。
That's why I'm not impressed
with your story, Dad.

2127
01:51:53,256 --> 01:51:55,325
這是你知道什麼
我所經歷的，
It's that you knew what
I was going through,

2128
01:51:55,326 --> 01:51:57,294
而你沒有做任何事情，
and you didn't do anything about it,

2129
01:51:57,295 --> 01:52:01,032
這使得你一個
不合理的懦夫。
and that makes you an
unconscionable coward.

2130
01:52:02,599 --> 01:52:04,935
而不是沒有，但
「想」是一個動詞，沒事，
And not for nothing, but
"think" is a verb, all right,

2131
01:52:04,936 --> 01:52:06,335
讓「不同」的副詞。
making "different" an adverb.

2132
01:52:06,336 --> 01:52:08,304
你問的人有不同的想法。
You're asking people to think differently.

2133
01:52:08,305 --> 01:52:10,106
你可以談談包豪斯運動
And you can talk about the Bauhaus movement

2134
01:52:10,107 --> 01:52:12,107
和布朗和「簡單
是精緻「
and Braun and "Simplicity
is sophistication"

2135
01:52:12,108 --> 01:52:15,445
與三宅一生制服
鮑勃·迪倫的歌詞你想要的，
and Issey Miyake uniforms and
Bob Dylan lyrics all you want,

2136
01:52:15,446 --> 01:52:20,151
但那個東西看起來像
朱迪傑特森的易烘烤爐。
but that thing looks like
Judy Jetson's Easy-Bake oven.

2137
01:52:39,370 --> 01:52:40,536
嘿。
Hey.

2138
01:52:40,537 --> 01:52:43,138
你要去起步較晚。
You're gonna start late.

2139
01:52:43,139 --> 01:52:45,342
- 你知道麗莎主張？
- 什麼？
- You know what Lisa stood for?
- What?

2140
01:52:45,343 --> 01:52:47,544
計算機。 該麗莎。
你知道這是什麼主張？
The computer. The Lisa.
You know what it stood for?

2141
01:52:47,545 --> 01:52:50,679
對不起，我說，對
iMac電腦。 這不是我的真實想法。
I'm sorry I said that about the
iMac. It's not what I really think.

2142
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:54,683
在我背後，在辦公室，
你知道這是什麼主張？
Behind my back, at the office,
you know what it stood for?

2143
01:52:54,684 --> 01:52:58,253
本地集成系統
建築。 我五歲。
Local Integrated System
Architecture. I was five.

2144
01:52:58,254 --> 01:53:00,957
- 你為什麼不能只是躺在？
- 我做到了。
- Why couldn't you just lie?
- I did.

2145
01:53:01,992 --> 01:53:04,227
當然，這是後命名。
Of course it was named after you.

2146
01:53:04,228 --> 01:53:09,132
本地集成系統架構
甚至不意味著任何東西。
Local Integrated System Architecture
doesn't even mean anything.

2147
01:53:09,133 --> 01:53:12,068
為什麼你說這是不是所有的那些年？
Why'd you say it wasn't all those years?

2148
01:53:14,071 --> 01:53:15,973
我真的不知道。
I honestly don't know.

2149
01:53:18,275 --> 01:53:20,745
為什麼你說你不是我的父親？
Why'd you say you weren't my father?

2150
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,150
我不好做。
I'm poorly made.

2151
01:53:33,656 --> 01:53:37,194
- 這是9點以後。 你要遲到了。
- 我不在乎。
- It's after 9:00. You're gonna be late.
- I don't care.

2152
01:53:42,366 --> 01:53:44,467
- 你寫的<I>深紅</i>
- 什麼？
- You're writing for the <i>Crimson.</i>
- What?

2153
01:53:44,468 --> 01:53:46,535
的蘋果章
哈佛校友會
The Apple chapter of the
Harvard Alumni Association

2154
01:53:46,536 --> 01:53:48,370
告訴我你寫
對於<I>深紅。</i>
tells me you're writing
for the <i>Crimson.</i>

2155
01:53:48,371 --> 01:53:52,042
哦。 是的，一點點。 雜文。
Oh. Yeah, a little bit. Essays.

2156
01:53:52,043 --> 01:53:54,811
- 我想讀之一。
- 當然。
- I'd like to read one.
- Sure.

2157
01:53:54,812 --> 01:53:57,280
不，我的意思了。 我想
讀你的文章之一了。
No, I mean now. I'd like to
read one of your essays now.

2158
01:53:57,281 --> 01:53:59,717
加油。 你必須去在舞台上。
Come on. You've got to go on stage.

2159
01:54:01,317 --> 01:54:04,320
在iMac將無法啟動，直到
你給我你的論文之一。
The iMac will not be launched until
you give me one of your essays,

2160
01:54:04,321 --> 01:54:07,992
所以世界正等著你。
so the world is waiting for you.

2161
01:54:14,598 --> 01:54:17,633
我真的很抱歉，夥計們。
I'm really sorry, guys.

2162
01:54:17,634 --> 01:54:19,202
祝你好運。
Good luck.

2163
01:54:32,148 --> 01:54:33,716
我要去把音樂在你的口袋裏。
I'm gonna put music in your pocket.

2164
01:54:33,717 --> 01:54:35,820
什麼？
What?

2165
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:41,790
百首歌曲。 一千首歌曲。 500首歌曲。
Hundred songs. A thousand songs. 500 songs.

2166
01:54:41,791 --> 01:54:46,161
介於500和
幾千首歌曲就在你的口袋裏，
Somewhere between 500 and a
thousand songs right in your pocket,

2167
01:54:46,162 --> 01:54:49,499
因為我不能忍受看著
那令人費解的Walkman了。
'cause I can't stand looking at
that inexplicable Walkman anymore.

2168
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:51,767
你帶著一個
磚播放盒式磁帶上。
You're carrying around a
brick playing cassette tape.

2169
01:54:51,768 --> 01:54:53,636
我們不是野蠻人。
We're not savages.

2170
01:54:53,637 --> 01:54:56,806
所以我要把一千
歌曲在你的口袋裏。
So I'm gonna put a thousand
songs in your pocket.

2171
01:54:56,807 --> 01:54:59,441
- 你能做到嗎？
- 嗯 - 嗯。
- You can do that?
- Mm-hmm.
