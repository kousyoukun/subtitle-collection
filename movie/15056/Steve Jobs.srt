Enjoy The Movie.

2
00:00:25,575 --> 00:00:29,677
MAN #1: And with that movie <i>2001,</i>
you're projecting us into the 21st century.

3
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:31,679
- I brought along my son Jonathan...
- MAN #2: Hi.

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,417
Who in the year 2001 will
be the same age as I am now.

5
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:40,521
Maybe he will be better adjusted to this
kind of world that you're trying to portray.

6
00:00:40,522 --> 00:00:42,490
MAN #2: The big difference,
when he grows up...

7
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:44,660
In fact, if we wanted to
wait till the year 2001...

8
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:47,762
He will have in his own house

9
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:50,966
not a computer as big as
this, but at least a console

10
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,670
through which he can talk to
his friendly local computer

11
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:56,972
and get all the information
he needs for his everyday life,

12
00:00:56,973 --> 00:01:00,508
like his bank statements,
his theater reservations,

13
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:05,948
all the information you need in the course
of living in a complex modern society.

14
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:10,052
This will be in a compact
form in his own house.

15
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:13,421
He'll have a television screen,
like these here, and a keyboard.

16
00:01:13,422 --> 00:01:15,790
And he'll talk to the computer
and get information from it.

17
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:18,560
And he'll take it as much for
granted as we take the telephone.

18
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:21,829
MAN #1: I wonder, though, what sort of
a life would it be like in social terms?

19
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,566
I mean, if our whole life
is built around the computer,

20
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:26,668
do we become a computer-dependent society?

21
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,704
In some ways, but they
will also enrich our society

22
00:01:29,705 --> 00:01:33,508
because it will make it possible for
us to live, really, anywhere we like.

23
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,346
Any businessman and executive
could live almost anywhere on Earth

24
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:40,948
and still do his business
through a device like this.

25
00:01:40,949 --> 00:01:44,552
And this is a wonderful thing. It means
we won't have to be stuck in cities.

26
00:01:44,553 --> 00:01:48,357
We'll be able to live out in the
country or wherever we please.

27
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:54,930
MAN #3: <i>Screen says it's
an unimplemented trap.</i>

28
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:57,533
<i>But the error code is
wrong. It's a system error.</i>

29
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,734
- WOMAN: <i>So what's the upshot?</i>
- MAN #3: <i>It's not gonna say hello.</i>

30
00:01:59,735 --> 00:02:01,170
MAN #4: <i>It absolutely
is gonna say hello.</i>

31
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:03,638
<i>- It's nobody's fault. It's a system error.
- You built the voice demo.</i>

32
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:05,674
- The voice demo is flaky.
- Keep your voices down.

33
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:07,742
I've been telling you that
for... This thing is overbuilt.

34
00:02:07,743 --> 00:02:10,011
It worked last night. It
worked the night before that.

35
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:11,347
It worked three hours ago.

36
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:14,483
- It's not working now, so just skip over the voice demo.
- Fuck you.

37
00:02:14,484 --> 00:02:15,818
- Everything else is working.
- Shh.

38
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:17,519
Skip over the voice demo.

39
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,021
We need it to say hello.

40
00:02:19,022 --> 00:02:22,623
- You're not hearing me. It's not going to say hello.
- Just fix it.

41
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:23,925
- Fix it?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:26,628
(scoffing)

43
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:27,763
- In 40 minutes?
- Fix it.

44
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:29,630
- I can't.
- Who's the person who can?

45
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:32,335
I'm the person who can, and I can't.

46
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:35,636
- How bad are you saying?
- It's pretty bad.

47
00:02:35,637 --> 00:02:39,441
- I don't know what that means.
- It means the demo is more than likely gonna crash.

48
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:40,842
You have to keep your voices down.

49
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:42,878
Joel Pforzheimer is
sitting out in the house.

50
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,447
I don't care if... Who's Joel Pforzheimer?

51
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:46,914
<i>GQ.</i>

52
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:49,617
He's been shadowing you
for a week. Did you notice?

53
00:02:49,618 --> 00:02:51,486
Just look like everything's fine.

54
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:53,889
He's sitting out in the house.

55
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,425
Hey.

56
00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:59,128
What are you guys saying?

57
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:02,698
Some kind of race condition, but we
haven't been able to track it down yet.

58
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:04,165
Is the synthesizer sampling fast enough?

59
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,901
No, so the rates are off
and it keeps crashing.

60
00:03:06,902 --> 00:03:09,872
WOMAN: It's 20 seconds out of a
two-hour launch. Why not just cut it?

61
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:11,507
- We can't cut it.
- Yeah, you just cut it.

62
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:15,510
Two days ago, we ran a Super Bowl ad that
could've won the Oscar for Best Short Film.

63
00:03:15,511 --> 00:03:18,880
There are more people who can tell you about
the ad than can tell you who won the game.

64
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:21,749
I understand, but the ad said
the Mac was gonna save the world.

65
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,885
It didn't say it was gonna say hello.

66
00:03:23,886 --> 00:03:25,687
WOMAN #2: We open the house in five.

67
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:28,157
Don't open the house.

68
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:29,724
We're taking a quick break.

69
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:31,259
- Part of the problem is...
- What?

70
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,431
We can recompile, but if it's a hardware
problem, we can't get into the back.

71
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:36,998
Why not?

72
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,835
- Do you wanna tell her or should I?
- Don't start with me, man.

73
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:42,204
- Why can't he get into the machine?
- You need special tools.

74
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:44,806
What kind of special tools?
Just take a screwdriver.

75
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,842
He didn't want users to be able to open it.

76
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:49,812
You need special tools.

77
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,347
(whispers) Is this for real?

78
00:03:51,348 --> 00:03:54,483
There are a hundred engineers walking
around here. None of them have the tools?

79
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,985
In fairness, not many of
them were issued the tools.

80
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:01,156
- What about you?
- I left them at the office. It was 3:00 AM when I...

81
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,758
Oh, Jesus Christ.

82
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,826
- Cut "Hello."
- No.

83
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,028
- What's the first rule of a launch?
- It's not gonna crash.

84
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:08,597
It just did.

85
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:09,664
Andy!

86
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:11,532
Which one?

87
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:13,701
The other Andy. You're right
there. Why would I be calling out?

88
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:15,069
- He needs to talk to you.
- Yeah.

89
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,240
The exit signs need to be off or
we're not gonna get a full blackout.

90
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:21,009
- We've spoken to the building manager and the fire marshal.
- And?

91
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,077
There's no way they're gonna
let us turn the exit signs off.

92
00:04:23,078 --> 00:04:25,247
- (snaps fingers)
- I'll pay whatever the fine is.

93
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:27,615
The fine is they're gonna come
in and tell everyone to leave.

94
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:29,884
You explained to the fire marshal
that we're in here changing the world?

95
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:33,855
I did, but unless we can also change
the properties of fire, he doesn't care.

96
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,492
- Steve...
- If a fire causes a stampede to the unmarked exits,

97
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:38,894
it'll have been well worth
it for those who survive.

98
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:41,497
For those who don't, less
so, but still pretty good.

99
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:44,199
- Look, I...
- I need it to go black. Real black.

100
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,134
Get rid of the exit signs and
don't let me know how you did it.

101
00:04:47,135 --> 00:04:49,539
Fix the voice demo.

102
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:55,511
You need special tools to open the Mac?

103
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:57,278
You knew it was a closed system.

104
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,915
I didn't know literally. Jesus.

105
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,117
And if you keep alienating
people for no reason,

106
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:04,752
there's gonna be no one
left for it to say hello to.

107
00:05:04,753 --> 00:05:06,120
It's not for no reason.

108
00:05:06,121 --> 00:05:09,658
We blow this and IBM will own the
next 50 years like a Batman villain.

109
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:12,995
Remember the phone company? That's what
Bell was called, "the phone company."

110
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:15,062
IBM will be the computer company.

111
00:05:15,063 --> 00:05:17,766
Ten years later they'll
be the information company,

112
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:20,168
and that's very bad for the human race.

113
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:22,971
So we don't have time to
be polite or realistic,

114
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:25,540
'cause if we are, this
company's next product launch

115
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,108
will be held in front of 26 people

116
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:29,944
and a stringer from the
Alameda County Shopper's Guide.

117
00:05:29,945 --> 00:05:32,047
We haven't advertised the voice software.

118
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:35,951
We could pull it out of the demo
and no one would be disappointed.

119
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:38,052
Do you want to try being reasonable,

120
00:05:38,053 --> 00:05:42,291
just, you know, see what it feels like?

121
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:48,096
Okay. Pull the voice demo.

122
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,031
Thank you.

123
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:51,165
And then cancel the launch.

124
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,668
I see. You just tricked me a little.

125
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:56,305
You can tell me how unimportant it is,
but if the computer doesn't say hello,

126
00:05:56,306 --> 00:06:00,041
then neither will John Sculley,
who I promise you agrees with me.

127
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:03,711
Sculley's not gonna cancel the
launch 'cause he's not insane.

128
00:06:03,712 --> 00:06:05,947
He's also not a hack, and
when it comes to the Macintosh,

129
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,649
he's gonna do what I ask him to do.

130
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,185
- What's in this box?
- Nothing you need to worry about.

131
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:11,720
Don't even open it.

132
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:13,754
What the fuck?

133
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:16,692
Why is there a carton of... Who did this?

134
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:18,427
- Somebody thought...
- Who?

135
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:22,697
Doesn't matter. Thought it would be a good
idea to have copies of that <i>Time</i> cover

136
00:06:22,698 --> 00:06:24,233
available at everyone's seat.

137
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:27,302
It was nipped in the bud and all the
copies are being taken out of the building.

138
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,937
So problem solved.

139
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:31,872
- This isn't a Macintosh.
- I understand.

140
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:33,975
Somebody thought it would
be a good idea to, like,

141
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:38,747
enthusiastically hand over copies of
<i>Time</i> with a not-a-Macintosh on the cover

142
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:40,382
at the launch of the Macintosh?

143
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,283
What are they handing
out at Hewlett-Packard?

144
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:44,286
A bushel of apples with my face on them?

145
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:47,889
I'm sure the thinking was that
since the computer is Man of the Year

146
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,358
that that's good for our business,

147
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:51,759
but like I said, I'm having
them removed from the building.

148
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,129
What I'd like you to do with them
is to take them, all 2,600 copies,

149
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,932
and stack them on Kottke's desk

150
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:59,033
and tell him Steve says,
"Happy New Year to you."

151
00:06:59,034 --> 00:06:59,935
Okay.

152
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:02,204
I gave <i>Time</i> magazine full access.

153
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:04,906
The whole campus: Bandley, Apple II, Lisa.

154
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:09,411
I gave him Sculley, Markkula. I
gave him Woz. I gave him everybody.

155
00:07:09,412 --> 00:07:12,781
What should I call the person who thought
it'd be a good idea to hand these out?

156
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:15,016
I'm not telling you who it was.

157
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,386
It was done without malice.
It's been taken care of.

158
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:20,254
You have a half hour and we
have things to talk about.

159
00:07:20,255 --> 00:07:21,923
Like what?

160
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:25,793
(sighs) Like a million
in the first 90 days.

161
00:07:25,794 --> 00:07:27,194
- Joanna...
- 20,000 a month after that.

162
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:28,562
- Look. Those are the forecasts.
- I'm begging...

163
00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:34,403
This is my field. I'm begging you
to manage expectations out there.

164
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:38,939
- I'm fanning expectations.
- We're not gonna sell a million in the first 90 days.

165
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,744
Everyone, everyone, everyone,

166
00:07:42,745 --> 00:07:45,312
<i>everyone</i> is waiting for the Mac.

167
00:07:45,313 --> 00:07:47,115
Maybe.

168
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:50,018
But what happens when they
find out that for 2,495,

169
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:53,120
there's nothing you can do with it?

170
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:55,423
We were competitive at $1,500,

171
00:07:55,424 --> 00:07:59,360
but once you replaced the
Motorola 6809 with the 68000...

172
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:03,098
Which is what supports menus, windows,
point and click, high-res graphics...

173
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:06,334
Yeah, 'cause everyone needs
rectangles with rounded corners.

174
00:08:06,335 --> 00:08:10,907
Coach lands on the runway at the
exact same time as first class.

175
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:16,778
I don't have the first
fucking idea what that means,

176
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:18,747
but this is how it got to $2,500,

177
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,084
which is the price point on
the PC, which can do a lot more!

178
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,353
Who's gonna want a PC?
What idiot is gonna want...

179
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:28,889
If I wanna tell you there's a spot
on your shirt, I point to the spot.

180
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,827
I don't say there's a spot 14
centimeters down from the collar

181
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:34,796
and three centimeters to the
right of the second button

182
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:37,932
while I try to remember what
the command is for club soda.

183
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,934
That's not how a person's mind works.

184
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:44,740
If the goal was ease of use, maybe
you should've given it some memory.

185
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:47,374
You can complain about memory
or you can complain about price,

186
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,445
but you can't do both at the same time.

187
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,413
Memory is what costs money.

188
00:08:52,414 --> 00:08:54,883
I'm glad you're telling me
your feelings about the Mac now

189
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:56,518
because we have a half hour left.

190
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,153
We can redesign it.

191
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:00,889
I'm just asking you to manage expectations.

192
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,857
Look at their faces
when they see what it is.

193
00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:06,193
They won't know what they're
looking at or why they like it,

194
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:08,230
but they'll know they want it.

195
00:09:08,231 --> 00:09:10,999
Not instantly. When people
heard <i>Rite of Spring,</i>

196
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,235
they tore the chairs out of the theater.

197
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:14,436
They didn't buy the record.

198
00:09:14,437 --> 00:09:17,371
<i>Rite of Spring</i> happens
to be the most revolutionary

199
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:19,039
and provocative symphony
of the last century.

200
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,375
Ballet. It was a ballet.

201
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:25,246
But Igor Stravinsky didn't say he
was gonna sell 20,000 units a month.

202
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,883
I don't know why we're
talking about Stravinsky

203
00:09:27,884 --> 00:09:32,086
when what I care about is Dan Kottke
sodomizing me in <i>Time</i> magazine.

204
00:09:32,087 --> 00:09:36,390
(sighs) Look. Obviously...

205
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:38,360
Let me say this to you.

206
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:41,462
Obviously, Daniel didn't think
he was doing anything wrong.

207
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:45,033
- By talking to <i>Time</i> about it?
- Yeah.

208
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:47,067
I don't know what that means.

209
00:09:47,068 --> 00:09:49,804
You said, when you told me the story...

210
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:51,907
You said you said to Dan,

211
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:54,842
"Did <i>Time</i> magazine ask you
if I had a daughter named Lisa?"

212
00:09:54,843 --> 00:09:56,378
And Dan said, "Yeah."

213
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,316
My point was that he answered
you simply and honestly

214
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:03,451
because he didn't think
he'd done anything wrong.

215
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:08,222
Except, Joanna... Except I
don't have a daughter named Lisa.

216
00:10:08,223 --> 00:10:12,159
And this story is now about how I'm
denying paternity and took a blood test.

217
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,496
And that's why there's a picture of...
I don't know what the fuck that is.

218
00:10:15,497 --> 00:10:17,999
That's why there's a
picture of a PC on the cover

219
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,570
instead of a picture of me and the Mac.

220
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:23,938
I don't know what to tell you.

221
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:27,609
I was supposed to be <i>Time</i>
magazine's Man of the Year.

222
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,279
And then Dan Kottke was born.

223
00:10:35,116 --> 00:10:37,085
- Well...
- What?

224
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:41,188
- She's waiting for you.
- Who?

225
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:43,158
- Chrisann.
- Brennan?

226
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,625
They're out in the hall.

227
00:10:44,626 --> 00:10:48,129
They've been sitting in the back of
the auditorium since 7:00 this morning.

228
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,566
I'm not having a session
with Chrisann right now.

229
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:55,269
We issued 335 press
credentials for the launch.

230
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,273
Steve, you piss off Chrisann,

231
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:01,543
she's gonna stand in the
lobby and give 335 interviews,

232
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:06,783
and you, pal, will be longing for
the halcyon days of Dan Kottke.

233
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,219
(sighs) Let me get this over with.

234
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,520
But don't leave. You're gonna stay here.

235
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:14,956
What? No. I'm not.

236
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:18,426
No. There's less of a chance of a
scene if you stay here. She'll be cool.

237
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:23,298
(exhales) I find all this
excruciatingly personal and-and...

238
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:25,933
I-I'm... I'm not staying.

239
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:27,434
No. Come on.

240
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:30,639
I don't wanna be in a
room alone with Chrisann.

241
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:35,945
This is me and you.

242
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,917
Fine.

243
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,093
Hey.

244
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,931
Steve.

245
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:57,298
This is a surprise.

246
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,600
Why don't you come on in?

247
00:11:59,601 --> 00:12:01,837
Thank you.

248
00:12:04,073 --> 00:12:06,474
- You coming too?
- Yes, I'm not gonna leave her in the hallway.

249
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,943
Okay. It's a safe hallway, but anyway.

250
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:11,712
You remember Joanna Hoffman? She's
the head of marketing for the Mac.

251
00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:14,182
Good to see you.

252
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:16,650
Nice to see you. Hello, Lisa.

253
00:12:16,651 --> 00:12:19,653
We've met before, and you told
me you like the way I talk,

254
00:12:19,654 --> 00:12:23,357
and that was my favorite
thing anyone's ever said to me.

255
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:25,360
- You're from Poland.
- Yes, I am.

256
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:28,129
- Do you know where that is?
- The top of the Earth.

257
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,097
I think you're thinking of the North Pole.

258
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:31,999
Well, we're a little
pressed for time, so...

259
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,402
- I'll leave you guys alone.
- Why do you wanna leave when you just said...

260
00:12:34,403 --> 00:12:36,839
I'm gonna check in with Hertzfeld.

261
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:46,548
We're trying to get a
computer to say hello,

262
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:49,116
but right now it's being very shy.

263
00:12:49,117 --> 00:12:51,052
Would you come help me? Is that okay?

264
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:52,653
Sure.

265
00:12:52,654 --> 00:12:55,123
STEVE: Thank you.

266
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:57,057
My dad named a computer after me.

267
00:12:57,058 --> 00:13:00,495
I'm not your...

268
00:13:00,496 --> 00:13:03,731
Actually, do you know what
a coincidence is, Lisa?

269
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:06,169
No.

270
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,404
Like if you met someone.

271
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:12,706
You made a new friend
and her name was Lisa too.

272
00:13:12,707 --> 00:13:14,576
That would be a coincidence.

273
00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:17,578
"Lisa" stands for "Local
Integrated Systems Architecture."

274
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,215
L-I-S-A.

275
00:13:21,683 --> 00:13:23,785
It's a coincidence.

276
00:13:25,487 --> 00:13:27,654
- You about done?
- Yeah.

277
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:28,489
Okay.

278
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:33,930
Come. Let's make that computer say hi.

279
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:37,097
Go ahead, Lisa.

280
00:13:37,098 --> 00:13:40,268
So it was the other way around.

281
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:42,537
I was named after the computer?

282
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:45,807
Nothing was named after
anybody. It's a coincidence.

283
00:13:45,808 --> 00:13:48,144
Come on.

284
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:54,383
What's the matter with you?

285
00:13:54,384 --> 00:13:56,583
What's the matter with you? Why
are you telling her these things?

286
00:13:56,584 --> 00:13:58,552
Why are you still telling
her I'm her father?

287
00:13:58,553 --> 00:14:00,455
- A judge told her you're her father.
- No, he didn't.

288
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:02,322
Where the hell do you get off
telling <i>Time</i> magazine

289
00:14:02,323 --> 00:14:04,325
I've slept with 28 percent
of the men in America?

290
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:06,293
- That's not...
- Where do you get off?

291
00:14:06,294 --> 00:14:09,130
That's not remotely what I said.

292
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:14,168
It's right here. (exhales)

293
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:16,137
First of all, can I tell you
something about <i>Time</i> magazine?

294
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:18,840
I believe it's a training
facility for paid assassins.

295
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:22,342
- "Jobs insists"... I am quoting...
- I didn't invent math.

296
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:25,480
CHRISANN: "...twenty-eight percent of
the male population of the United States

297
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:27,615
could be the father."

298
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,619
I wasn't saying you've slept
with 28% of American men.

299
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,522
I was using an algorithm
based on the blood test

300
00:14:34,523 --> 00:14:38,659
which said there was a 94.1%
chance that I'm the father.

301
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,863
You're trying to publicly
paint me as a slut and a whore.

302
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:44,365
Believe me, I'm not trying to
publicly do anything with you.

303
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:46,067
Two million people read
<i>Time.</i> How am I supposed...

304
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:49,703
It would be more if they put me on the cover,
but Dan Kottke decided to kidney-punch me...

305
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:52,874
- I applied for welfare yesterday.
- STEVE: I'm sorry?

306
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,878
- Hello!
- I said I applied for welfare yesterday.

307
00:14:57,178 --> 00:15:01,615
The <i>Time</i> article said your
Apple stock was worth $441 million,

308
00:15:01,616 --> 00:15:03,750
and I wanted to ask you
how you felt about that.

309
00:15:03,751 --> 00:15:06,587
Well, I feel like Apple stock
has been dramatically undervalued.

310
00:15:06,588 --> 00:15:08,523
This would be a good time to get in.

311
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:11,259
Your daughter and her mother...

312
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,461
- Chrisann...
- are on welfare.

313
00:15:13,462 --> 00:15:16,197
We're living in a hovel in Menlo Park.

314
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:17,698
We can't pay the heating bills.

315
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:20,235
She sleeps in a parka.

316
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:22,537
- Your daughter...
- She's not my daughter!

317
00:15:22,538 --> 00:15:25,572
Because, as reported
by <i>Time</i> magazine,

318
00:15:25,573 --> 00:15:28,543
- I've slept with 28% of the men in America?
- No.

319
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:32,148
All of them, exactly nine
months before Lisa was born.

320
00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:37,418
- (knocks)
- (door opens)

321
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:39,287
I've got Andy here.

322
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:41,289
(door closes)

323
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,331
Excuse me.

324
00:15:57,405 --> 00:15:58,572
We're there?

325
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:00,575
- Hey, Chris.
- CHRISANN: Hey, Andy.

326
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:02,342
- How are you doin'?
- Terrible.

327
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:03,677
STEVE: You guys caught up now?

328
00:16:03,678 --> 00:16:06,313
Excuse me for saying hello to my
friend, who thinks you're a dick.

329
00:16:06,314 --> 00:16:07,715
- I don't think you're a...
- We're there?

330
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,751
- No. It's got a one-in-six chance of working.
- Goddamn it.

331
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:15,590
Well, we're not a pit crew at Daytona.
This can't be fixed in seconds.

332
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:18,458
You didn't have seconds.
You had three weeks.

333
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:21,528
The universe was created
in a third of that time.

334
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:23,798
Well, someday you'll have
to tell us how you did it.

335
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:26,235
(chuckles)

336
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:29,736
Here's what I'm gonna do.

337
00:16:29,737 --> 00:16:33,874
I'm gonna announce the names of
everyone who designed the launch demo.

338
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,677
I'm gonna introduce everyone
and ask them to stand up.

339
00:16:36,678 --> 00:16:38,980
The bag was designed by Susan Kare.

340
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:42,884
The Macintosh font that's scrolling across
the screen was designed by Steve Capps.

341
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:46,221
The starry night and
skywriting was Bruce Horn.

342
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:51,859
MacPaint, MacWrite, Alice,
down to the calculator.

343
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,762
And then I'm gonna say the
voice demo that didn't work

344
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,667
was designed by Andy Hertzfeld.

345
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:03,771
(chuckles)

346
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,238
Steve...

347
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:08,508
Five-in-six is your chance of surviving
the first round of Russian roulette,

348
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:10,378
and you've reversed those odds.

349
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:12,580
So unless you wanna be disgraced
in front of your friends,

350
00:17:12,581 --> 00:17:15,783
family, colleagues,
stockholders and the press,

351
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,552
I wouldn't stand here arguing.

352
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:20,921
I'd go try and get some
more bullets out of the gun.

353
00:17:20,922 --> 00:17:23,258
Do it, Andy!

354
00:17:27,729 --> 00:17:29,397
Stop. You.

355
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:31,299
- What size shirt do you wear?
- Me?

356
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,801
Does anyone know what size shirt
he wears? What size shirt I wear?

357
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,036
JOANNA: Does anyone know where
the closest psychiatrist is?

358
00:17:36,037 --> 00:17:38,906
The disk fits in your pocket.

359
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:41,542
I need a shirt with a breast
pocket. I can take it out onstage.

360
00:17:41,543 --> 00:17:43,043
- A shirt?
- The disk!

361
00:17:43,044 --> 00:17:46,046
I need a white shirt in my
size with a breast pocket.

362
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:49,350
Yes. Which one of the no
stores that are open at 8:45

363
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:52,853
do you want me to have someone run
to and return from in 15 minutes?

364
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:56,724
Go out in the lobby, find someone
my size who's wearing a white shirt.

365
00:17:56,725 --> 00:17:59,026
Tell them I'll trade
them for a free computer,

366
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:00,794
and they get to keep my shirt.

367
00:18:00,795 --> 00:18:03,063
Does it have to be a
white shirt? Is blue okay?

368
00:18:03,064 --> 00:18:07,802
No. The Mac is beige, I'm beige, the
disk is blue, the shirt has to be white.

369
00:18:07,803 --> 00:18:09,237
Andy?

370
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:28,989
(exhales)

371
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,024
(clicks tongue)

372
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:33,828
STEVE (imitating computer):
Hello, I'm Macintosh.

373
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:37,732
Bring me the head of Andy Hertzfeld.

374
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:39,966
I tried to get it to
say hello, but it's shy.

375
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:42,035
Yeah.

376
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:43,603
So that's it?

377
00:18:43,604 --> 00:18:46,207
STEVE: That's it.

378
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:49,110
I don't get it.

379
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:50,745
I know.

380
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:52,612
What are people going to do with it?

381
00:18:52,613 --> 00:18:54,349
Lisa, how old are you now?

382
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,484
- You know how old she is.
- How old are you, Lisa?

383
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:58,254
Five.

384
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,524
Come sit here for a minute.

385
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:07,527
Do you know what this is?

386
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:10,630
- It's a computer.
- It's a computer.

387
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:13,134
Can I borrow your hand for a second?

388
00:19:14,402 --> 00:19:17,139
Point that arrow and click.

389
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,676
You don't have to, but if you
want, you can play with it.

390
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:24,911
Nothing you can do will break it,
so just do whatever you want with it.

391
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:26,112
What are you doing?

392
00:19:26,113 --> 00:19:29,883
I'm paying you exactly what
the court ordered me to pay you.

393
00:19:29,884 --> 00:19:32,786
$385 a month.

394
00:19:32,787 --> 00:19:34,755
I'm not the one who decided on that amount.

395
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,657
And I'm asking you how you feel.

396
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:38,158
If you feel all right.

397
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:41,661
- If it feels all right to you that your daughter...
- She's not my...

398
00:19:41,662 --> 00:19:44,399
That your daughter and
her mother are on welfare

399
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,402
while you're worth $441
million for making that.

400
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:51,539
I'm proud to say Apple donates
computers to underfunded schools,

401
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,041
- and we'll be doing more of the same with the Mac...
- What?

402
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:57,844
Apple donates millions of dollars'
worth of computers to schools.

403
00:19:57,845 --> 00:19:59,880
What does that have to do with...

404
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:04,752
Imagine an underprivileged kid that has
their favorite teacher with them 24 hours.

405
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:06,687
We're minutes away from
being able to do that.

406
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:09,424
In your head, was that
an answer to my question?

407
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:10,957
Tell me the question again.

408
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:11,958
(scoffs)

409
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:14,128
I wasn't the one who sued
you for child support.

410
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,697
- No, let...
- San Mateo County sued you.

411
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:19,699
No, let me explain what happened,
'cause I have plenty of time right now.

412
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,436
- (knocks)
- (door opens)

413
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:23,070
Excuse me. You have a visitor.

414
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:25,639
Just wanted to say good
luck. Hey, Chrisann.

415
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,444
- Hello, Woz.
- Hang on.

416
00:20:29,578 --> 00:20:31,978
(clears throat, groans)

417
00:20:31,979 --> 00:20:34,482
- Just wanted to say good luck.
- Thanks. You too.

418
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,882
- It's a big morning.
- Yeah.

419
00:20:35,883 --> 00:20:37,784
You should see this crowd out there.

420
00:20:37,785 --> 00:20:40,421
This crowd, it's like, um...

421
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:44,524
I can't really wait for you to
come up with a metaphor, man.

422
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:47,462
- Yeah. So, listen, I want to ask you a favor.
- Yeah?

423
00:20:47,463 --> 00:20:50,231
- Can you acknowledge the Apple II team in your remarks?
- I cannot.

424
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:51,799
Just an acknowledgement.

425
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,768
Have them stand up.

426
00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:56,870
- We're launching the Mac.
- It'd be a morale booster.

427
00:20:56,871 --> 00:20:59,040
Just a mention so they could
get a round of applause.

428
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,242
- Just a mention.
- Can we stick a pin in this for a minute?

429
00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:02,776
- Sure.
- Thank you.

430
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:05,012
Just talking about an
acknowledgement for the team.

431
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,180
I've got Chrisann in there.
I'll see you in a second.

432
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:09,649
Yep.

433
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,024
That.

434
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,391
What?

435
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:21,928
You asked me what people are gonna
do with it. They're gonna do that.

436
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:23,898
(knocks)

437
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:25,966
One of the engineers.

438
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:27,937
Thank you.

439
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,146
Do you like it?

440
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:41,181
I'm sorry?

441
00:21:41,182 --> 00:21:43,950
It's an abstract.

442
00:21:43,951 --> 00:21:48,289
(chuckles) You used MacPaint.

443
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:54,529
Push that key and the "S" at the same time.

444
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,197
- (disk whirring)
- (mouse clicks)

445
00:21:57,198 --> 00:21:59,000
Now type your name.

446
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:01,303
(typing)

447
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,580
Do you know which box says "Save"?

448
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:16,217
Right. Go ahead and click on it.

449
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,626
I'll put some money in your account

450
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:28,763
and buy you a new house,
someplace near a decent school.

451
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,732
Thank you.

452
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:34,735
Woz wants a minute.

453
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:37,204
And Sculley's asking for you.

454
00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:40,107
We're done?

455
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,042
(scoffs)

456
00:22:41,043 --> 00:22:44,277
Could you teach me more things?

457
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:46,613
On the computer?

458
00:22:46,614 --> 00:22:48,583
Lisa, wait for me in the hall, please.

459
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:54,187
You can put your coat on in the hall.

460
00:22:54,188 --> 00:22:55,623
Bye, Lisa.

461
00:22:56,691 --> 00:22:59,327
- Bye.
- CHRISANN: Lisa, in the hall. Now.

462
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,762
I wanna know, when you say you're
gonna put money in my account,

463
00:23:01,763 --> 00:23:03,164
how much we're talking about.

464
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:05,768
It's a school day. She
needs to be in school.

465
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,239
I'm gonna give you whatever you need.

466
00:23:23,284 --> 00:23:25,387
(door closes)

467
00:23:26,888 --> 00:23:31,024
Woz wants me to acknowledge
the Apple II team.

468
00:23:31,025 --> 00:23:33,260
You must be able to see
that she looks like you.

469
00:23:33,261 --> 00:23:35,830
I don't want to insult Woz. I
just think it's backward-looking

470
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,665
at exactly the wrong moment.

471
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,700
- I know you heard what I said.
- I heard what you said, Joanna.

472
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:43,904
It's just we're about to do this thing.

473
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:49,043
At 9:41, the planet's gonna shift
on its axis nigh and forever.

474
00:23:49,044 --> 00:23:51,779
Two most significant
events of the 20th century:

475
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,649
the Allies win the war and this.

476
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,016
This.

477
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,319
So maybe right now isn't the
very best time to scold me

478
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,222
for not being a better father
to a kid who's not my kid.

479
00:24:01,223 --> 00:24:04,324
- The test said I...
- I don't care what the test said.

480
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:05,592
I don't care about 94.1%

481
00:24:05,593 --> 00:24:08,329
or the insane algorithm you used
to get to 28% of American men.

482
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,430
Buying her a new house.
I'm giving her money.

483
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:13,167
There's a small girl who
believes you're her father.

484
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:17,671
That's all. That's all the math there is.

485
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:21,207
She believes it. What are
you gonna do about that?

486
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,977
God sent his only son on a suicide mission,

487
00:24:23,978 --> 00:24:27,682
but we like him anyway
because he made trees.

488
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,918
We're gonna sell a million
units in the first 90 days.

489
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,987
- (sighs)
- 20,000 a month after that.

490
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:36,792
So maybe you could give
me a break, Ms. Hoffman?

491
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,799
(pushes button twice)

492
00:24:47,468 --> 00:24:49,871
(elevator bell dings)

493
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,519
(breathes deeply)

494
00:25:11,793 --> 00:25:14,696
(no audible dialogue)

495
00:25:26,408 --> 00:25:28,375
(elevator bell dings)

496
00:25:28,376 --> 00:25:30,377
- Woz.
- Hey.

497
00:25:30,378 --> 00:25:33,013
There's nothing in that vending
machine that won't kill you.

498
00:25:33,014 --> 00:25:35,248
- Just browsing.
- Let's take a walk.

499
00:25:35,249 --> 00:25:37,350
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah.

500
00:25:37,351 --> 00:25:40,754
After the meeting in Maui, the Apple
II team was upset and angry and down.

501
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:43,157
- Do you know why?
- Because the Apple II wasn't mentioned even once?

502
00:25:43,158 --> 00:25:45,793
The Apple II wasn't mentioned ev...

503
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,427
Yes, that's it. You have it. Yes.

504
00:25:47,428 --> 00:25:50,531
- That wasn't an oversight.
- They know that. They know it wasn't.

505
00:25:50,532 --> 00:25:52,766
I don't wanna make a
big deal out of this...

506
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:54,334
That's entirely within your power.

507
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:57,103
- The Apple II is...
- The Apple II is what was, my friend.

508
00:25:57,104 --> 00:26:00,808
The Apple II is what pays the bills
around here and has for seven years.

509
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,075
And if you embarrass these people,

510
00:26:02,076 --> 00:26:05,044
you are going to see a brain
drain at this company, my brother.

511
00:26:05,045 --> 00:26:07,814
Markkula took you off the Lisa, not
them and not me, so don't blame...

512
00:26:07,815 --> 00:26:12,319
Markkula took me off the Lisa because of his
strong religious objection to making it good.

513
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,188
Now I gave you everything
you wanted on the Apple II.

514
00:26:15,189 --> 00:26:16,924
You don't ask for a lot?

515
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:19,392
There wasn't a single fight you lost.

516
00:26:19,393 --> 00:26:21,962
Do you concede the slots are the
reason for the success of the Apple II?

517
00:26:21,963 --> 00:26:24,098
- We can't still be talking about the slots.
- I have a point.

518
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:27,066
It's been seven years. You're still
doing it. You're talking about the slots.

519
00:26:27,067 --> 00:26:30,004
There's something wrong with you.
This argument started in the garage.

520
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:34,809
What are you talking about? Why
would you only want two slots?

521
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,811
A printer and a modem.

522
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:38,344
With eight slots, you...

523
00:26:38,345 --> 00:26:41,415
This is a huge deal that we
were able to add eight slots.

524
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:44,318
I appreciate the engineering,
but it's not what we're doing.

525
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:46,020
- And thank God I won that argument...
- Woz.

526
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,822
Because the open system is what
people love about the machine,

527
00:26:48,823 --> 00:26:50,323
and it's why it sold and still sells.

528
00:26:50,324 --> 00:26:52,993
An open system. We're
not doing an open system.

529
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:56,964
Of course we are. That's what people want,
and the breakthrough on the Apple II...

530
00:26:56,965 --> 00:26:59,833
People don't know what they
want until you show it to them.

531
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:04,504
Serious users want to customize. They
wanna modify. They wanna jack it up.

532
00:27:04,505 --> 00:27:08,042
They want hardware engineers like
me to expand its capabilities, okay?

533
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,976
Keyboards for music, better sound board,

534
00:27:09,977 --> 00:27:11,879
better display boards,
improved memory cards.

535
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,215
And it's why there are
3,000 people here right now.

536
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:18,252
The slots are what allowed the Apple II
to run, for just one example, VisiCalc,

537
00:27:18,253 --> 00:27:22,356
which from my guess single-handedly sold
between 200,000 and 300,000 machines.

538
00:27:22,357 --> 00:27:25,325
- They want slots.
- They don't get a vote.

539
00:27:25,326 --> 00:27:28,862
When Dylan wrote "Shelter from the Storm," he
didn't ask people to contribute to the lyrics.

540
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:30,864
Plays don't stop so the
playwright can ask the audience

541
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:32,233
what scene they'd like to see next.

542
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,200
- Painters...
- Hobbyists...

543
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:36,870
We're on the verge of
a tectonic... Hobbyists?

544
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:38,806
A printer and a modem. Two slots.

545
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:42,008
The Apple II team has my affection,

546
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:45,478
but I'm not loving up a seven-year-old
product at the Mac launch.

547
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:48,882
- Computers aren't paintings.
- Fuck you.

548
00:27:48,883 --> 00:27:52,285
I'm gonna say "fuck you" every time you
say that until you either die or stop.

549
00:27:52,286 --> 00:27:53,987
- Steve...
- Try it.

550
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:55,121
- Steve.
- Say it.

551
00:27:55,122 --> 00:27:57,925
- Computers aren't paintings.
- Fuck you.

552
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,995
Yes, they are, and what
I want is a closed system.

553
00:28:00,996 --> 00:28:05,100
End-to-end control. Completely
incompatible with anything.

554
00:28:09,137 --> 00:28:11,572
Computers aren't supposed
to have human flaws.

555
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:15,009
I'm not going to build this one with yours.

556
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,553
(both) Steve!

557
00:28:27,554 --> 00:28:28,589
Hey.

558
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:32,225
Today is about the Macintosh.
And the Mac is mine.

559
00:28:32,226 --> 00:28:33,994
- I give you that.
- Thank you.

560
00:28:33,995 --> 00:28:36,397
I give you that. Just publicly
acknowledge the Apple II team

561
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:37,831
'cause it's the right thing to do.

562
00:28:37,832 --> 00:28:41,467
We'll know soon enough if you are
Leonardo da Vinci or just think you are,

563
00:28:41,468 --> 00:28:43,236
but in the meantime, it would be great...

564
00:28:43,237 --> 00:28:46,139
In the meantime, the Apple II is done.

565
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,207
Seven years. It was a great run.

566
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:50,746
You should go out in the
house and take your seat.

567
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,448
The Mac is Jef Raskin's.

568
00:28:55,449 --> 00:28:57,051
Say it for me.

569
00:28:57,052 --> 00:28:58,518
- Computers aren't...
- Fuck you.

570
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,486
All right.

571
00:29:00,487 --> 00:29:02,757
(chattering)

572
00:29:05,126 --> 00:29:07,062
Five, six...

573
00:29:08,362 --> 00:29:10,097
- We're there?
- I need more time.

574
00:29:10,098 --> 00:29:12,131
- You can't have it.
- 20 minutes.

575
00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:14,435
- It's 8:58.
- We can start late.

576
00:29:14,436 --> 00:29:17,236
Hear me. We're a computer
company. We can't start late.

577
00:29:17,237 --> 00:29:19,305
- Then I have another idea.
- What?

578
00:29:19,306 --> 00:29:22,008
It's deceptive and borderline unethical.

579
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:24,078
- I'm listening.
- It'll run on the 512.

580
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:26,045
- You tested it?
- Yeah.

581
00:29:26,046 --> 00:29:30,383
- Wait. You're gonna demo a 128 computer on a 512?
- Nobody's gonna know.

582
00:29:30,384 --> 00:29:33,087
And you think that's
<i>borderline</i> unethical?

583
00:29:33,088 --> 00:29:35,989
Name my other choices, please.

584
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,693
Please. You have to tell me why it's
so important for it to say hello.

585
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:43,764
Hollywood. They made
computers scary things.

586
00:29:43,765 --> 00:29:47,400
See how this reminds you of a friendly
face, that the disk slot is a goofy grin?

587
00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:52,072
It's warm and it's playful
and it needs to say hello.

588
00:29:52,073 --> 00:29:54,408
It needs to say hello because it can.

589
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:56,977
(applause grows louder)

590
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,549
(scattered screaming)

591
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,517
We're not committing fraud.

592
00:30:04,518 --> 00:30:07,620
The 512 is gonna ship in under a year.

593
00:30:07,621 --> 00:30:10,792
Will you absolve me of your
Eastern European disapproval?

594
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:16,629
The computer in <i>2001</i> said hello all the time
and it still scared the shit out of me.

595
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,967
Absolve me.

596
00:30:20,067 --> 00:30:22,602
Just for this.

597
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:25,104
And just for now.

598
00:30:25,105 --> 00:30:31,078
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
founding board member Mike Markkula.

599
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:40,654
All right. Okay.

600
00:30:40,655 --> 00:30:43,256
Go make a dent in the universe, Steven.

601
00:30:43,257 --> 00:30:45,559
See you in a couple hours.

602
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,262
And I'm going to take us through
the formal part of the meeting,

603
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,696
the legal part, if you will.

604
00:30:49,697 --> 00:30:53,332
STEVE: Thank merciful God.
The cavalry's shown up.

605
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:56,469
MAN: I hear you've been worse than usual this
morning. I didn't think that was possible.

606
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:00,206
So I've been dispatched
as the "Steve Whisperer."

607
00:31:00,207 --> 00:31:02,609
This is a '55 Margaux.

608
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,245
- It's 9:00 in the morning.
- This is a '55 Margaux.

609
00:31:06,246 --> 00:31:08,614
(chuckles)

610
00:31:08,615 --> 00:31:12,820
Is it my imagination or have
you started to dress like me?

611
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:15,722
It was a bad idea to have Markkula
open with quarterly reports.

612
00:31:15,723 --> 00:31:17,858
Instead we should have just
dropped water on the audience.

613
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:21,495
You know, just big 10,000-gallon tanks
of cold water, dropped from the ceiling.

614
00:31:21,496 --> 00:31:23,362
Save Mike some money on index cards.

615
00:31:23,363 --> 00:31:25,832
- Oh, just relax.
- Why?

616
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,802
I don't know. No one's
ever asked me that question.

617
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,206
- (chuckles)
- There you go.

618
00:31:36,643 --> 00:31:39,379
You're the only one who sees
the world the same way I do.

619
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,217
No one sees the world the same way you do.

620
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,319
I'm like Julius Caesar, John.

621
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,888
- I'm surrounded by enemies.
- No, you're not.

622
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:51,190
- The board...
- Oh, the board. The board's behind you.

623
00:31:51,191 --> 00:31:52,825
Only because you see to it they are.

624
00:31:52,826 --> 00:31:54,227
I think it's a good board,

625
00:31:54,228 --> 00:31:57,397
but if you want me to push them out
one by one, we can talk about that.

626
00:31:57,398 --> 00:31:59,299
I want you to push them out all at once...

627
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,834
through a window, if it's the nearest exit.

628
00:32:01,835 --> 00:32:04,138
The look on their faces
when we showed them the spot.

629
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:06,873
I couldn't see their faces, 'cause they
were banging their heads on the table.

630
00:32:06,874 --> 00:32:10,811
Yeah, yeah. Yesterday, the
day after it airs <i>once,</i>

631
00:32:10,812 --> 00:32:13,514
the publisher of <i>Adweek</i> calls
it the best commercial of all time.

632
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:17,148
Of all time! And it is.

633
00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:19,785
And if anyone does one better, it's gonna be
Chiat/Day, who the board wanted to replace,

634
00:32:19,786 --> 00:32:22,555
and it's gonna be Lee Clow, who the
board thought was out of his mind.

635
00:32:22,556 --> 00:32:25,359
MAN #1 (on PA): <i>Ladies
and gentlemen, "1984."</i>

636
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,727
MAN #2 (on monitor): <i>The
first glorious anniversary</i>

637
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:30,330
<i>of the information
purification directives.</i>

638
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:34,600
<i>We have created for the
first time in all history</i>

639
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:37,638
<i>a garden of pure ideology</i>

640
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:40,239
<i>where each worker may bloom,</i>

641
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,710
<i>secure from the pests purveying
contradictory thoughts.</i>

642
00:32:44,711 --> 00:32:50,883
<i>Our unification of thoughts is more powerful
a weapon than any fleet or army on earth.</i>

643
00:32:50,884 --> 00:32:52,485
<i>We are one people...</i>

644
00:32:52,486 --> 00:32:54,220
Did we use skinheads as extras?

645
00:32:54,221 --> 00:32:56,689
- A couple of people have told me that.
- Yeah.

646
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,859
We paid skinheads? I've
got skinheads on my payroll?

647
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,527
- They had a look you wanted.
- The skinheads?

648
00:33:01,528 --> 00:33:04,731
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's keep that to ourselves.

649
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:05,799
<i>(grunts)</i>

650
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,169
MAN #2: <i>We shall prevail.</i>

651
00:33:12,273 --> 00:33:16,944
MALE ANNOUNCER: <i>On January 24th, Apple
Computer will introduce Macintosh.</i>

652
00:33:16,945 --> 00:33:19,379
- JOHN: Who else knows?
- STEVE: Who else knows what?

653
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,482
- That we paid terrorists to be in our TV commercial.
- John...

654
00:33:22,483 --> 00:33:25,319
They were wrong about the ad, but
they're a good board. Good people.

655
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,853
Their only problem... Their
problem is that they're people.

656
00:33:27,854 --> 00:33:32,225
People. The very nature of people
is something to be overcome.

657
00:33:32,226 --> 00:33:37,231
When I was running Pepsi, we had a lot
of success focusing on 18-to-55-year-olds

658
00:33:37,232 --> 00:33:39,632
- who weren't members of violent hate groups.
- I get it.

659
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:41,368
You're not surrounded by enemies.

660
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:43,536
We're almost there.

661
00:33:43,537 --> 00:33:46,372
I'm back and forth on the Dylan.

662
00:33:46,373 --> 00:33:47,707
I might quote a different verse.

663
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:48,941
JOHN: What are the choices?

664
00:33:48,942 --> 00:33:51,511
"For the loser now will be later to win,"

665
00:33:51,512 --> 00:33:53,714
- which is what we have.
- Mm-hmm. Or?

666
00:33:53,715 --> 00:33:56,550
"Come mothers and fathers
throughout the land

667
00:33:56,551 --> 00:33:58,485
and don't criticize what
you can't understand.

668
00:33:58,486 --> 00:33:59,986
Your sons and your daughters"...

669
00:33:59,987 --> 00:34:01,588
"Are beyond your command."

670
00:34:01,589 --> 00:34:03,389
I just lost a hundred
bucks to Andy Hertzfeld.

671
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:06,260
He said you'd change it to that verse.

672
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:10,165
We got 45 seconds. I want to
use it to ask you a question.

673
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:15,902
Why do people who are adopted feel like
they were rejected instead of selected?

674
00:34:15,903 --> 00:34:17,069
That came out of nowhere.

675
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,538
"Your sons and your daughters
are beyond your command.

676
00:34:19,539 --> 00:34:21,641
Your old road is rapidly aging."

677
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,344
So go fuck yourself, because
my name is Steve Jobs,

678
00:34:24,345 --> 00:34:26,347
and the times, they are a-changin'.

679
00:34:27,447 --> 00:34:29,016
I don't feel rejected.

680
00:34:29,017 --> 00:34:31,018
- You're sure?
- Very sure.

681
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:33,687
'Cause it's not like the baby is
born and the parents look and say,

682
00:34:33,688 --> 00:34:36,556
"Nah, we're not interested in this one."

683
00:34:36,557 --> 00:34:38,459
On the other hand, someone did choose you.

684
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,132
It's having no control.

685
00:34:46,968 --> 00:34:48,969
You find out you were out of the loop

686
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:52,407
when the most crucial events
in your life were set in motion.

687
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,412
As long as you have control.

688
00:34:58,713 --> 00:35:01,216
I don't understand people who give it up.

689
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:06,018
What inspired Hertzfeld to make that bet?

690
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:10,324
He was warning me that being your
father figure could be dangerous.

691
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:13,726
Keep your 100 bucks. I'm
sticking with the first verse.

692
00:35:13,727 --> 00:35:14,560
Good.

693
00:35:14,561 --> 00:35:16,996
- What the hell does he mean?
- Nothing.

694
00:35:16,997 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm proud of you.

695
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:23,402
Thank you, boss.

696
00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:27,341
MARKKULA: It's my pleasure to introduce
my friend and the CEO of Apple,

697
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:29,076
- John Sculley.
- (applause)

698
00:35:29,077 --> 00:35:30,743
STEVE: John?

699
00:35:30,744 --> 00:35:32,112
Yeah?

700
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:35,150
Lisa made a painting on the Mac.

701
00:35:38,753 --> 00:35:42,054
MALE REPORTER #1: <i>The Macintosh,
Apple's near mythological home computer,</i>

702
00:35:42,055 --> 00:35:45,659
<i>has gotten off to a rocky start in
its battle with industry titan IBM.</i>

703
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,895
FEMALE REPORTER #1: <i>With sales originally
projected to be a million in the first quarter,</i>

704
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,130
<i>Apple has sold only 35,000
of the user-friendly machines</i>

705
00:35:51,131 --> 00:35:53,567
<i>in the months since it's
been available to customers.</i>

706
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,000
MALE REPORTER #2: <i>The
insistence by Steve Jobs</i>

707
00:35:55,001 --> 00:35:56,735
<i>that it have what's
called end-to-end control,</i>

708
00:35:56,736 --> 00:36:01,375
<i>which is a way of saying that it's not compatible
with most outside hardware or software,</i>

709
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:04,578
<i>is the Shakespearean flaw in a
machine that</i> had <i>potential.</i>

710
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,480
MALE REPORTER #3: <i>Apple Computers
closed two of its factories today</i>

711
00:36:07,481 --> 00:36:08,915
<i>in the wake of disappointing sales.</i>

712

FEMALE REPORTER #2: <i>Do you know how
many Macs were sold last month? 500.</i>

713
00:36:12,153 --> 00:36:15,054
MALE REPORTER #4: <i>In a move that
surprised some but not all on Wall Street,</i>

714
00:36:15,055 --> 00:36:17,656
<i>the board of directors of
Apple Computers voted today</i>

715
00:36:17,657 --> 00:36:20,060
<i>to fire its cofounder Steve Jobs.</i>

716
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:22,094
MALE REPORTER #5: <i>Did he
jump or was he pushed?</i>

717
00:36:22,095 --> 00:36:25,931
<i>His ex-boss, Apple CEO John
Sculley, refused to comment.</i>

718
00:36:25,932 --> 00:36:27,933
MALE REPORTER #6: <i>However,
in an exclusive interview,</i>

719
00:36:27,934 --> 00:36:32,038
<i>Steve Wozniak has slammed the
integrity of his old friend Steve Jobs.</i>

720
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:35,141
<i>He calls Jobs an
insulting and hurtful guy.</i>

721
00:36:35,142 --> 00:36:38,677
FEMALE REPORTER #3: <i>Jobs is hitting back
with a new company and a new computer.</i>

722
00:36:38,678 --> 00:36:40,781
<i>Apple has a new competitor.</i>

MAN: <i>On the slide?</i>

729
00:37:02,135 --> 00:37:03,904
The floor. The pin spot.

730
00:37:03,905 --> 00:37:05,938
I think we want a sharp focus.

731
00:37:05,939 --> 00:37:09,442
Don't take it personally. Just
not a fan of the circus aesthetic.

732
00:37:09,443 --> 00:37:13,446
All right, let's hold here. We're gonna
have to go up and refocus the instruments.

733
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:15,882
Just one. The 30 is fine.

734
00:37:15,883 --> 00:37:19,118
While we're holding, there are
well-wishers in the VIP room.

735
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,821
And Woz is here.

736
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:23,656
Steve Wozniak. Yes.
(chuckles) Thank you very much.

737
00:37:23,657 --> 00:37:25,192
JOANNA: <i>And Andy Hertzfeld.</i>

738
00:37:25,193 --> 00:37:27,594
Andy Hertzfeld. Thank you.

739
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:30,496
JOANNA: <i>John Sculley is here too.</i>

740
00:37:30,497 --> 00:37:32,466
It's nice that he's here.

741
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:34,801
STEVE: Really? I don't
think it's very nice at all.

742
00:37:34,802 --> 00:37:37,136
JOANNA: You have to see them.
They wanna pay their respects.

743
00:37:37,137 --> 00:37:39,772
If they were respectful, we'd
all still be at Apple right now.

744
00:37:39,773 --> 00:37:41,475
(scoffs) Look...

745
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:43,576
If they really wished me well,
they'd keep to themselves.

746
00:37:43,577 --> 00:37:46,112
- Can I tell you something?
- I don't think they do wish me well.

747
00:37:46,113 --> 00:37:48,581
<i>But I'm all right with
that. I'm over Apple.</i>

748
00:37:48,582 --> 00:37:50,817
I got over the Mac and Woz and Sculley,

749
00:37:50,818 --> 00:37:52,752
the same way you get over
your high school sweetheart.

750
00:37:52,753 --> 00:37:54,554
Build a new one.

751
00:37:54,555 --> 00:37:56,755
- Can I tell you something?
- Yes.

752
00:37:56,756 --> 00:37:58,558
You said you wouldn't compete with them,

753
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:01,862
but you designed a computer
specifically for the education market,

754
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,929
which they putatively own.

755
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:07,833
So, I think it's cool they're here.

756
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:10,036
- They're suing me.
- (elevator bell dings)

757
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,605
Still.

758
00:38:11,606 --> 00:38:13,707
It was nice they came.

759
00:38:15,242 --> 00:38:17,176
They're not being magnanimous.

760
00:38:17,177 --> 00:38:19,179
They want it to look
like an amicable divorce.

761
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,047
History doesn't remember Joe
DiMaggio kindly for dumping Marilyn.

762
00:38:22,048 --> 00:38:23,283
MAN: Steve?

763
00:38:23,284 --> 00:38:25,118
(groans)

764
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,920
What's your problem?

765
00:38:26,921 --> 00:38:30,123
I don't know, but I'm sure
it can be traced back to you.

766
00:38:30,124 --> 00:38:33,792
You know, I'm the one who
has to explain you to people.

767
00:38:33,793 --> 00:38:36,830
$100,000 to Paul Rand for a corporate logo

768
00:38:36,831 --> 00:38:39,632
when we didn't even know
what our company made.

769
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:43,069
A $650,000 mold for the cube,

770
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,172
because God forbid the
angles be 90.1 instead of 90.

771
00:38:46,173 --> 00:38:49,208
I forbid the angles to
be 90.1 instead of 90.

772
00:38:49,209 --> 00:38:51,777
That box could be on
display at the Guggenheim.

773
00:38:51,778 --> 00:38:54,013
Don't give them reason to say to the press

774
00:38:54,014 --> 00:38:55,949
you have a chip on your shoulder.

775
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,717
Will you do that for me?

776
00:38:57,718 --> 00:38:59,319
I don't have a chip on my shoulder.

777
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,953
(chuckling) Okay, okay.

778
00:39:00,954 --> 00:39:04,658
But don't give them a reason to say you do.

779
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:06,159
I don't.

780
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,228
- That's the right attitude.
- That's not an attitude.

781
00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:10,696
They're gonna call me back in
a minute to look at the light.

782
00:39:10,697 --> 00:39:12,866
- Get one out of the way.
- Fine!

783
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:16,335
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

784
00:39:16,336 --> 00:39:18,737
- One more thing.
- Sure.

785
00:39:18,738 --> 00:39:21,040
No questions from the press after.

786
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:23,275
No... Why?

787
00:39:23,276 --> 00:39:26,346
Until I have better
answers, no press avail.

788
00:39:26,347 --> 00:39:30,450
Somebody asks where I am, you just
saw me, and I'll be right back.

789
00:39:32,218 --> 00:39:33,688
Okay.

790
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,857
Who do you want first?

791
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:41,028
Bring me the face of Steve Wozniak.

792
00:39:49,336 --> 00:39:52,739
- (exhales)
- Hang on.

793
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,174
- I thought you went to school.
- Hang on.

794
00:39:55,175 --> 00:39:57,911
You were supposed to go to school
an hour ago. I thought you left.

795
00:39:57,912 --> 00:40:00,279
I didn't wake up my mom
on time this morning.

796
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,081
It's happened before too.

797
00:40:02,082 --> 00:40:06,152
I wake up with the alarm and then
I get dressed and eat breakfast,

798
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,821
but sometimes I forget to see
what time it is after that.

799
00:40:08,822 --> 00:40:11,690
- Why doesn't your mom just set her own alarm clock?
- It's one of my chores.

800
00:40:11,691 --> 00:40:14,893
I don't understand what that has
to do with why you're still...

801
00:40:14,894 --> 00:40:16,196
Where's your mother?

802
00:40:16,197 --> 00:40:18,297
LISA: <i>She went to find a pay phone.</i>

803
00:40:18,298 --> 00:40:20,199
An hour ago, she said...

804
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,034
You don't have to raise your hand.

805
00:40:22,035 --> 00:40:24,804
- You said it was off by a little.
- It is.

806
00:40:24,805 --> 00:40:26,806
- I just measured it.
- Joanna...

807
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:28,775
Exactly a foot on all four sides.

808
00:40:28,776 --> 00:40:30,310
There are six sides.

809
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:32,411
But you're not supposed
to be here right now.

810
00:40:32,412 --> 00:40:35,681
We know if four of the sides
are equal to each other,

811
00:40:35,682 --> 00:40:38,085
the other two must be equal as well.

812
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,388
The top, bottom, right and left

813
00:40:41,389 --> 00:40:43,757
are about a millimeter shorter
than the front and back.

814
00:40:43,758 --> 00:40:45,257
They're not. I measured them.

815
00:40:45,258 --> 00:40:47,793
Lisa, I'm kind of an expert in design.

816
00:40:47,794 --> 00:40:50,897
And that's a 20-cent ruler. You think
there's a chance it could be off?

817
00:40:50,898 --> 00:40:54,433
If I had another ruler, I would measure
this ruler, but I really doubt it's off.

818
00:40:54,434 --> 00:40:58,337
- When your mother comes back, you have to go to school.
- Because it's a ruler!

819
00:40:58,338 --> 00:40:59,973
Why is it off?

820
00:40:59,974 --> 00:41:01,308
- Did you hear what I just said?
- Yes.

821
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:03,877
Because sometimes it seems like
you just keep saying what you want

822
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,880
without listening.

823
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:14,154
I'm listening.

824
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:17,492
- Is there something you need?
- No.

825
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:22,094
Why isn't it a perfect cube?

826
00:41:22,095 --> 00:41:24,731
- You've asked me before.
- I forget what it is.

827
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:27,567
It's an optical anomaly.

828
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,837
To the human eye, a perfect
cube doesn't look like a cube,

829
00:41:30,838 --> 00:41:33,373
so we made it roughly a millimeter
shorter than a foot on two sides.

830
00:41:33,374 --> 00:41:34,940
What's an anomaly?

831
00:41:34,941 --> 00:41:36,810
You've asked me that before too.

832
00:41:36,811 --> 00:41:39,412
I don't know why you keep doing that.

833
00:41:42,015 --> 00:41:44,150
It's an exception. Something
that doesn't fit a pattern.

834
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:45,284
(knocks)

835
00:41:45,285 --> 00:41:47,353
You have to go to school. Come in!

836
00:41:47,354 --> 00:41:49,121
(door opens)

837
00:41:49,122 --> 00:41:51,324
(chuckles) I think you two have met.

838
00:41:51,325 --> 00:41:52,958
Hello, old friend.

839
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:56,029
- You look well.
- So do you. So do you.

840
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:59,998
And they're telling me George is
ready for you to look at the focus.

841
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:01,500
Take a walk with me.

842
00:42:01,501 --> 00:42:03,103
- Is this Lisa?
- Yeah.

843
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,004
- This can't be Lisa.
- It is.

844
00:42:05,005 --> 00:42:07,005
- Lisa's this big.
- They get taller. Come on.

845
00:42:07,006 --> 00:42:08,908
- Do you remember me?
- She doesn't.

846
00:42:08,909 --> 00:42:10,877
I'm your dad's friend Steve Wozniak.

847
00:42:10,878 --> 00:42:15,047
I apologize. I don't remember you.

848
00:42:15,048 --> 00:42:16,415
You're very polite. (chuckles)

849
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:18,118
- Woz?
- Yeah.

850
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,953
STEVE: Chrisann's at a pay
phone. Would you find her?

851
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,020
JOANNA: Yeah.

852
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:22,788
- (door opens)
- STEVE: <i>Good turnout.</i>

853
00:42:22,789 --> 00:42:24,223
- WOZNIAK: Great turnout.
- Yeah.

854
00:42:24,224 --> 00:42:27,159
- "Insanely great." (chuckles)
- Insanely great.

855
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,462
This is the first time we
haven't played for the same team.

856
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:32,031
It's like you're releasing
your first solo album.

857
00:42:32,032 --> 00:42:34,967
I, uh... I appreciate your
inviting me to the launch.

858
00:42:34,968 --> 00:42:36,469
I just want to wipe the slate clean.

859
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,105
That's exactly what I want.
That's why I came backstage.

860
00:42:39,106 --> 00:42:41,841
I want you to know, um,
I'll be out there with you.

861
00:42:41,842 --> 00:42:44,210
Any chance I can get you to
go out there instead of me?

862
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:46,011
(chuckles) I love you, Steve.

863
00:42:46,012 --> 00:42:47,446
I love you too, Woz.

864
00:42:47,447 --> 00:42:50,415
WOZNIAK: You know, some things were said.

865
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:52,384
STEVE: They were. They were said in public.

866
00:42:52,385 --> 00:42:55,455
They were published. Were
you pressured to do it?

867
00:42:55,456 --> 00:42:57,322
WOZNIAK: Was I what?

868
00:42:57,323 --> 00:43:03,062
Check it out. It's the orchestra
pit for the San Francisco Opera.

869
00:43:03,063 --> 00:43:05,330
Was I pressured to do it?

870
00:43:05,331 --> 00:43:08,433
I once met Seiji Ozawa at Tanglewood.

871
00:43:08,434 --> 00:43:10,870
A thunderous conductor.

872
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:12,971
Ungodly artfulness and nuance.

873
00:43:12,972 --> 00:43:17,543
And I asked him what exactly a
conductor does that a metronome can't.

874
00:43:17,544 --> 00:43:20,313
- Surprisingly, he...
- He didn't beat the living shit out of you? (chuckles)

875
00:43:20,314 --> 00:43:24,917
That's right. No, he said, "The
musicians play their instruments.

876
00:43:24,918 --> 00:43:26,819
I play the orchestra."

877
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,056
That feels like something that sounds
good, but doesn't mean anything.

878
00:43:30,057 --> 00:43:34,194
Markkula, Sculley... Did they ask
you to slag me off in the press?

879
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,228
I had reason to be angry.

880
00:43:36,229 --> 00:43:37,964
- Did they?
- Absolutely not.

881
00:43:37,965 --> 00:43:39,399
But they asked you to talk.

882
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,201
Apple was under siege.
You'd just left the company.

883
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:42,935
Someone had to talk to the press.

884
00:43:42,936 --> 00:43:46,371
I'm right here, Woz. The company left me.

885
00:43:46,372 --> 00:43:49,042
I begged you. I begged you.

886
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,243
The Apple II accounted
for 70% of the revenue.

887
00:43:51,244 --> 00:43:53,846
What did you think was gonna happen?

888
00:43:53,847 --> 00:43:57,217
You didn't care enough about
the Apple II or the Lisa.

889
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:58,851
Let's be really clear.

890
00:43:58,852 --> 00:44:01,755
I didn't care at all about
the Apple II or the Lisa.

891
00:44:03,122 --> 00:44:05,357
I wasn't pressured to do it.

892
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:11,897
What I said to the press was an honest,
if tempered, reflection of what I believed.

893
00:44:11,898 --> 00:44:13,933
- Woz.
- Yeah?

894
00:44:13,934 --> 00:44:16,335
What the fuck is on your wrist?

895
00:44:16,336 --> 00:44:19,505
- You wanna know?
- I literally can't wait.

896
00:44:19,506 --> 00:44:21,607
Everyone's gonna be
wearing these in 10 years.

897
00:44:21,608 --> 00:44:24,009
It's a Nixie watch, made using Nixie tubes.

898
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:26,379
This is actually
40-year-old technology.

899
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,315
Cold cathode tubes. They're
operating at 140 volts.

900
00:44:29,316 --> 00:44:31,317
I tilt my wrist 45
degrees, it's right there.

901
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:33,085
Hours, minutes and seconds.

902
00:44:33,086 --> 00:44:35,520
The way our minds work. Look at that.

903
00:44:35,521 --> 00:44:38,123
Do me a favor. Set the watch
ahead like you're on a plane

904
00:44:38,124 --> 00:44:39,592
and just changed time zones.

905
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,360
Not a problem.

906
00:44:41,361 --> 00:44:45,899
Unscrew that. Just hit the button.

907
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:50,435
Excuse me. Flight attendant? The man next
to me would appear to be detonating a bomb.

908
00:44:50,436 --> 00:44:52,404
You think this looks like a bomb.

909
00:44:52,405 --> 00:44:55,342
Even right now, I'm not 100% sure it isn't.

910
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:59,814
- I think maybe once people get used to it...
- No.

911
00:45:04,584 --> 00:45:07,654
I was angry.

912
00:45:07,655 --> 00:45:10,489
You were saying things about the Apple II,
and the way you were treating the team...

913
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:14,192
Woz. You get a free pass for life.

914
00:45:14,193 --> 00:45:17,630
I got to get back onstage. We got
two minutes of rehearsal time left.

915
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:21,601
Do you understand how condescending
that just was? Maybe you don't.

916
00:45:21,602 --> 00:45:24,203
I don't want to see you get dragged
off an airplane in plastic handcuffs.

917
00:45:24,204 --> 00:45:27,473
I get a free pass for life from you?

918
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:30,542
You give out the pass...
Y-Y-You give them to me?

919
00:45:30,543 --> 00:45:32,344
You're gonna have a stroke, little buddy.

920
00:45:32,345 --> 00:45:35,849
What did you do? What did you do?

921
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:39,252
Why has Lisa not heard of me?

922
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:42,721
Shit, man, how many
fourth-graders have heard of you?

923
00:45:42,722 --> 00:45:47,092
You can't write code. You're not
an engineer. You're not a designer.

924
00:45:47,093 --> 00:45:49,328
You can't put a hammer to a nail.

925
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,964
I built the circuit board.

926
00:45:50,965 --> 00:45:53,433
The graphical interface
was stolen from Xerox PARC.

927
00:45:53,434 --> 00:45:57,170
Jef Raskin was the leader of the Mac team
before you threw him off his own project.

928
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,373
Everything... Someone
else designed the box.

929
00:46:00,374 --> 00:46:02,308
So how come 10 times in a day,

930
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:06,112
I read "Steve Jobs is a genius"?

931
00:46:06,113 --> 00:46:07,980
What do you do?

932
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:09,649
I play the orchestra.

933
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,683
And you're a good musician.
You sit right there.

934
00:46:11,684 --> 00:46:13,719
You're the best in your row.

935
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,054
I came here to clear the air.

936
00:46:16,055 --> 00:46:18,491
- Do you know why I came here?
- Didn't you just answer that?

937
00:46:18,492 --> 00:46:21,326
I came here because
you're gonna get killed.

938
00:46:21,327 --> 00:46:24,330
Your computer's gonna fail.

939
00:46:24,331 --> 00:46:26,766
You had a college and
university advisory board

940
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:29,735
telling you they need a powerful
workstation for 2,000 to 3,000.

941
00:46:29,736 --> 00:46:32,005
You've priced NeXT at 6,500.

942
00:46:32,006 --> 00:46:34,540
And that doesn't include the
optional $3,000 hard drive,

943
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:37,243
which people will discover isn't optional.

944
00:46:37,244 --> 00:46:40,279
Because the optical disk
is too weak to do anything.

945
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,417
And the $2,500 laser printer
brings the total to $12,000.

946
00:46:44,418 --> 00:46:46,518
And in the entire world,
you are the only person

947
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:49,321
who cares that it's
housed in a perfect cube.

948
00:46:49,322 --> 00:46:51,524
You're gonna get killed.

949
00:46:51,525 --> 00:46:54,159
And I came here to stand
next to you while that happens

950
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,161
because that's what friends do.

951
00:46:56,162 --> 00:47:01,034
That's what men do. I don't need your pass.

952
00:47:01,035 --> 00:47:03,469
We go back, so don't talk
to me like I'm other people.

953
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:05,705
I'm the only one that knows

954
00:47:05,706 --> 00:47:08,708
that this guy here is someone you invented.

955
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:13,478
I'm standing by you because that
perfect cube that does nothing

956
00:47:13,479 --> 00:47:16,181
is about to be the single biggest failure

957
00:47:16,182 --> 00:47:18,952
in the history of personal computing.

958
00:47:20,586 --> 00:47:23,690
Tell me something else I don't know.

959
00:47:29,195 --> 00:47:30,797
- Back onstage?
- We're out of time.

960
00:47:30,798 --> 00:47:34,500
They've got to mop the
stage and open the house.

961
00:47:34,501 --> 00:47:38,203
If it crashes, it crashes, right?

962
00:47:38,204 --> 00:47:39,739
You'll make a joke.

963
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,339
I'll make a joke.

964
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,775
If it crashes, it crashes.

965
00:47:43,776 --> 00:47:47,446
It's a good slogan. "NeXT.
If it crashes, it crashes."

966
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,614
I'm not just talking about the demo, Steve.

967
00:47:49,615 --> 00:47:52,085
If it tanks, we don't swallow cyanide.

968
00:47:52,086 --> 00:47:54,853
- We go back to the drawing board.
- No more drawing boards.

969
00:47:54,854 --> 00:47:57,422
Invent the Edsel twice, you
don't get any more drawing boards.

970
00:47:57,423 --> 00:47:58,857
Tell me what the plan is.

971
00:47:58,858 --> 00:48:01,259
You have to tell me the
plan, because I don't know.

972
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:05,098
You're walking around like
you've got "Can't Lose" cards.

973
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:09,134
The plan will reveal itself to
you when you're ready to see it.

974
00:48:09,135 --> 00:48:11,603
Will I have to drop acid?

975
00:48:11,604 --> 00:48:13,172
Couldn't hurt.

976
00:48:13,173 --> 00:48:14,540
Is there a plan?

977
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:16,375
Have I ever let you down?

978
00:48:16,376 --> 00:48:18,243
Every single goddamn time.

979
00:48:18,244 --> 00:48:20,212
- Then I'm due.
- Is there?

980
00:48:20,213 --> 00:48:22,214
Joanna, there's a plan.

981
00:48:22,215 --> 00:48:25,784
I just don't wanna put you in a
position where you're lying to people.

982
00:48:25,785 --> 00:48:27,687
(sighs)

983
00:48:27,688 --> 00:48:31,190
Start 15 minutes late so Avie can
recompile and give us a fighting chance.

984
00:48:31,191 --> 00:48:33,493
Jesus Christ. How many times
are we gonna have this con...

985
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:35,393
- We're not starting late, ever!
- Fine!

986
00:48:35,394 --> 00:48:38,498
- We're not ever starting late.
- Late.

987
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:42,069
But where do you come
down on starting late?

988
00:48:44,204 --> 00:48:46,206
(snaps fingers)

989
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:54,614
Lisa's been doing this thing where she
asks me about stuff I've already told her.

990
00:48:54,615 --> 00:48:57,283
She asks me questions, and I know
she already knows the answers.

991
00:48:57,284 --> 00:48:58,717
What's that about?

992
00:48:58,718 --> 00:49:02,855
Kids do that when they're scared one
of their parents is in a bad mood.

993
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:06,424
They try to get you talking
about something you like.

994
00:49:06,425 --> 00:49:11,696
It's very common and can be treated by
talking to her about things she likes.

995
00:49:11,697 --> 00:49:16,234
Do you have any experience
or training in this field?

996
00:49:16,235 --> 00:49:17,435
No.

997
00:49:17,436 --> 00:49:20,073
Tell them to open the house.

998
00:49:26,613 --> 00:49:30,084
- Where's Lisa?
- She's around.

999
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:34,853
- What does that mean?
- She's running around the building.

1000
00:49:34,854 --> 00:49:37,455
An hour ago, you said you
were taking her to school.

1001
00:49:37,456 --> 00:49:40,726
She begged me to let her stay. There
are fathers who would so love...

1002
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:45,263
It is wrong, okay? It is morally
wrong, it's parentally wrong.

1003
00:49:45,264 --> 00:49:48,500
It is wrong for you to use Lisa
as a way of getting money from me.

1004
00:49:48,501 --> 00:49:51,469
She will know, if she doesn't already,
that that is your primary use for her.

1005
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:53,638
- (water splashes)
- She will hate you for the rest of your life.

1006
00:49:53,639 --> 00:49:57,442
She will see, if she doesn't already, that
her mother is a woman who stands up to men.

1007
00:49:57,443 --> 00:49:59,277
By living off of them.

1008
00:49:59,278 --> 00:50:02,214
By not letting myself be
imprisoned and degraded by them.

1009
00:50:02,215 --> 00:50:04,417
(toilet flushes)

1010
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,652
Imprisoned? I can't get rid of you.

1011
00:50:07,653 --> 00:50:10,422
I need a doctor and I need a dentist.

1012
00:50:10,423 --> 00:50:13,525
I dropped out of college after a
semester, but, okay, let's have a look.

1013
00:50:13,526 --> 00:50:15,860
You will support your
daughter and her mother.

1014
00:50:15,861 --> 00:50:18,397
Did you pay someone
$1,500 to bless your house?

1015
00:50:18,398 --> 00:50:20,799
- Did you hear what I said?
- Did you?

1016
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,768
I don't remember how much it was, Steve.

1017
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,471
- It was $1,500.
- Well, they don't do it for free.

1018
00:50:25,472 --> 00:50:27,005
They don't. They charge $1,500.

1019
00:50:27,006 --> 00:50:29,942
How I spend... Fuck. You
know, I'm not even gonna...

1020
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:33,645
Were you about to say, "How I spend
my money is none of your business"?

1021
00:50:33,646 --> 00:50:36,915
I have a sinus infection and
I need to see a dentist too.

1022
00:50:36,916 --> 00:50:39,618
So you can see how your blessing
budget could have been better spent.

1023
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:42,689
Like on a perfect cube?

1024
00:50:43,789 --> 00:50:46,259
- Look at me, Chrisann.
- What?

1025
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,326
- You know who I am, right?
- Yes.

1026
00:50:48,327 --> 00:50:50,696
- And you know I know people.
- What are you talking about?

1027
00:50:50,697 --> 00:50:54,533
Look at me. And you know the
people I know, they know people.

1028
00:50:54,534 --> 00:50:55,935
What is this?

1029
00:50:55,936 --> 00:50:59,571
If I ever hear again that you've
thrown a cereal bowl at Lisa's head...

1030
00:50:59,572 --> 00:51:01,774
- What?
- my private line's gonna ring,

1031
00:51:01,775 --> 00:51:04,743
and a voice on the other end
is gonna say, "We're all set."

1032
00:51:04,744 --> 00:51:07,013
- That's how I'll learn that you're dead.
- Are you cra...

1033
00:51:07,014 --> 00:51:09,281
I threw the bowl on the floor.

1034
00:51:09,282 --> 00:51:10,815
I didn't throw it at her head.

1035
00:51:10,816 --> 00:51:12,618
She wasn't even in the room.

1036
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:15,554
She was nowhere... I threw
the bowl on the floor.

1037
00:51:15,555 --> 00:51:18,658
She's a little girl. You're scaring her.

1038
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:21,359
I'm a grown man. You're scaring me.

1039
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,562
Taking out the garbage is a chore.

1040
00:51:23,563 --> 00:51:25,630
Clearing the table is a chore.

1041
00:51:25,631 --> 00:51:28,301
Waking you up in the morning
is just fucking creepy.

1042
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:31,304
- Please teach me more about being a parent.
- We're all done here.

1043
00:51:31,305 --> 00:51:34,607
It means so much coming from
someone who won't admit he is one.

1044
00:51:34,608 --> 00:51:36,609
- Stop screaming at Lisa.
- I give her responsibilities.

1045
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:38,743
- Got it.
- One day she's gonna thank me for it.

1046
00:51:38,744 --> 00:51:40,712
- Probably in your sleep.
- Fuck off!

1047
00:51:40,713 --> 00:51:41,681
Okay.

1048
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:44,482
I never... I never threw
anything at her head.

1049
00:51:44,483 --> 00:51:46,886
Steve.

1050
00:51:46,887 --> 00:51:49,721
I never would.

1051
00:51:49,722 --> 00:51:54,227
Things don't become so because you say so.

1052
00:51:55,461 --> 00:51:59,065
There'll be more money in your
account by the end of business.

1053
00:52:01,001 --> 00:52:03,236
(weeping)

1054
00:52:07,474 --> 00:52:10,144
- Were you being nice?
- Oh, yeah.

1055
00:52:14,046 --> 00:52:15,848
(weeping continues)

1056
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:19,484
- Andy's next.
- Hertzfeld or Cunningham?

1057
00:52:19,485 --> 00:52:24,190
Hertzfeld. He's playing with Avie
Tevanian on the computer backstage.

1058
00:52:25,959 --> 00:52:30,264
WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
the house is now open.

1059
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:40,039
(chattering)

1060
00:52:44,778 --> 00:52:49,013
- ...playing in front of thousands of people.
- Steve!

1061
00:52:49,014 --> 00:52:51,917
Can he do it later, Joel?
We go in eight minutes.

1062
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:54,552
- Can I get a quick reaction to the press this morning?
- What about it?

1063
00:52:54,553 --> 00:52:57,056
- The size of it, the volume.
- I'll tell you on background...

1064
00:52:57,057 --> 00:52:59,458
- I was hoping for a quote from Steve.
- I'll tell you on background

1065
00:52:59,459 --> 00:53:02,060
that I've never seen anything
like it in the tech industry.

1066
00:53:02,061 --> 00:53:05,063
I called the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
to take out a full-page ad for today,

1067
00:53:05,064 --> 00:53:07,400
and do you know what their sales guy said?

1068
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:11,804
"Why bother? It'd be like notifying
Macy's that tomorrow is Christmas."

1069
00:53:11,805 --> 00:53:13,873
- You saw the Stewart Alsop newsletter?
- I did.

1070
00:53:13,874 --> 00:53:16,107
I'm sorry, Joanna, I need
to get Steve on the record.

1071
00:53:16,108 --> 00:53:20,612
The headline was "Dear NeXT,
when can I get my machine?"

1072
00:53:20,613 --> 00:53:24,683
- When can he?
- We'll announce the ship date in the next eight to 10 weeks.

1073
00:53:24,684 --> 00:53:26,085
Alsop's not talking about the ship date.

1074
00:53:26,086 --> 00:53:28,754
He wants to know when he
can get one to play with.

1075
00:53:28,755 --> 00:53:30,855
We have a lot of respect for Stewart Alsop,

1076
00:53:30,856 --> 00:53:34,692
and we want to get a machine into his hands
so he can tell his subscribers about it.

1077
00:53:34,693 --> 00:53:37,429
- And when will that be?
- Very soon.

1078
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:40,098
Couple of days? A week?

1079
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:42,801
Off the record.

1080
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:45,170
- Off the record?
- Completely.

1081
00:53:45,171 --> 00:53:48,507
- We think...
- He'll get it when it's finished.

1082
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:50,109
It's not finished?

1083
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:51,411
It's almost finished.

1084
00:53:51,412 --> 00:53:54,513
- I've been watching you rehearse the demo for three weeks.
- Yeah.

1085
00:53:54,514 --> 00:53:55,947
- What's left?
- A little thing.

1086
00:53:55,948 --> 00:53:57,415
- What?
- I think that's enough.

1087
00:53:57,416 --> 00:54:00,786
We're off the record, and Joel's always
been good at understanding nuance.

1088
00:54:00,787 --> 00:54:03,022
What's left to finish?

1089
00:54:03,023 --> 00:54:07,260
I guess, in layman's terms, you'd
have to say we don't have an OS.

1090
00:54:09,896 --> 00:54:12,499
- An operating system?
- Yeah.

1091
00:54:13,733 --> 00:54:17,536
- JOEL: What do you mean?
- Well, the OS is what runs the computer.

1092
00:54:17,537 --> 00:54:19,471
In fact, it sort of is the computer.

1093
00:54:19,472 --> 00:54:21,774
How has it been running? How's
it gonna run this morning?

1094
00:54:21,775 --> 00:54:24,143
What do you mean, you don't have an OS?

1095
00:54:24,144 --> 00:54:27,679
STEVE: It's like this. Avie Tevanian
is our chief software designer,

1096
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,947
and he wrote a demo program.

1097
00:54:28,948 --> 00:54:32,484
It's like we built a great car,
but we haven't built the engine.

1098
00:54:32,485 --> 00:54:35,154
So we put a golf cart battery
in there to make it go for a bit.

1099
00:54:35,155 --> 00:54:38,022
All this computer knows how to do
right now is demonstrate itself.

1100
00:54:38,023 --> 00:54:40,525
You're telling me the only thing
you've built is a black cube?

1101
00:54:40,526 --> 00:54:42,495
Yes. Yeah.

1102
00:54:42,496 --> 00:54:44,663
But isn't it the coolest
black cube you've ever seen?

1103
00:54:44,664 --> 00:54:46,165
Is this... We're off the record.

1104
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:48,734
Is this a strategy or a
problem? If it's a problem...

1105
00:54:48,735 --> 00:54:52,737
Do not share proprietary
knowledge with that man.

1106
00:54:52,738 --> 00:54:54,906
It's not a problem.

1107
00:54:54,907 --> 00:54:56,674
I wouldn't understand it anyway.

1108
00:54:56,675 --> 00:54:59,612
I don't understand it either,
and my name's on the patents.

1109
00:54:59,613 --> 00:55:02,882
- It's got e-mail.
- Well, e-mail's not just for tech specialists anymore.

1110
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,583
Well, it is, but it won't be.

1111
00:55:04,584 --> 00:55:09,522
And I assume an e-mail sent on a NeXT computer
can only be received by a NeXT computer?

1112
00:55:09,523 --> 00:55:11,524
Closed,
end-to-end.

1113
00:55:11,525 --> 00:55:12,991
The new trash can is wrong.

1114
00:55:12,992 --> 00:55:15,293
I wanna tell you I appreciate
all the hours you put into it,

1115
00:55:15,294 --> 00:55:18,531
but I can't because of how terrible it is.

1116
00:55:18,532 --> 00:55:19,964
Go back to the other one.

1117
00:55:19,965 --> 00:55:22,567
Why are we still giving
three options on the clock?

1118
00:55:22,568 --> 00:55:25,871
- How many options do you want to give?
- Two. Buy it or don't.

1119
00:55:25,872 --> 00:55:27,540
Can I talk to you for a second?

1120
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:28,674
Abso-fruitly.

1121
00:55:28,675 --> 00:55:30,808
Uh, look, man. Avie's been recompiling,

1122
00:55:30,809 --> 00:55:33,112
but he says there may be
some glitches this morning.

1123
00:55:33,113 --> 00:55:35,114
If all there are are some glitches,

1124
00:55:35,115 --> 00:55:37,815
it'll be a triumph of miraculous magnitude.

1125
00:55:37,816 --> 00:55:39,884
Why are you translating for Avie?

1126
00:55:39,885 --> 00:55:43,922
I-I didn't want him to find out the hard
way your position on glitches in a demo,

1127
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,958
but it sounds like you've mellowed.

1128
00:55:45,959 --> 00:55:48,960
I've been growing, Andy. I've
been learning to love myself.

1129
00:55:48,961 --> 00:55:51,230
Hmm. I wouldn't have ever
dreamed that was a problem.

1130
00:55:51,231 --> 00:55:52,830
(chuckles) Fantastic burn.

1131
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,667
You need to go to your seat.

1132
00:55:54,668 --> 00:55:57,268
How about Lisa, getting into
a school for gifted kids?

1133
00:55:57,269 --> 00:55:59,904
Yeah, she was tested and
it turns out she can fly.

1134
00:55:59,905 --> 00:56:02,040
- Seriously, it's a big deal.
- I know it's a big deal.

1135
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:04,576
That's why I built the school a building.

1136
00:56:04,577 --> 00:56:07,880
- Well, I'm sure that's not why she got in.
- Really?

1137
00:56:07,881 --> 00:56:11,485
Uh, can I show you something
funny from <i>Macworld?</i>

1138
00:56:14,753 --> 00:56:18,790
- I can't think of anything I have to do right now.
- It'll make you feel good.

1139
00:56:18,791 --> 00:56:21,793
- Joanna! Look at this!
- Oh, Andy, he's only got a couple of minutes.

1140
00:56:21,794 --> 00:56:24,362
It's Guy Kawasaki writing in
<i>Macworld.</i> You're gonna like this.

1141
00:56:24,363 --> 00:56:26,364
Well, can we all enjoy it later?

1142
00:56:26,365 --> 00:56:31,235
He wrote a parody press release
about Apple buying NeXT for your OS.

1143
00:56:31,236 --> 00:56:35,139
He imagines a near future where Apple
needs your OS and has to buy NeXT,

1144
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:37,842
and-and you come back as CEO.

1145
00:56:37,843 --> 00:56:39,310
He has Gates saying,

1146
00:56:39,311 --> 00:56:44,284
"There would now be more innovations
from Jobs that Microsoft could copy."

1147
00:56:46,019 --> 00:56:49,989
- You can read it later.
- Thanks.

1148
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,625
She would've gotten in without
you donating a building.

1149
00:56:52,626 --> 00:56:56,329
Still, it's something to
talk about in the interview.

1150
00:56:58,764 --> 00:57:01,266
(exhales) All right. Good luck.

1151
00:57:01,267 --> 00:57:03,403
Thanks.

1152
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,038
Give that to me. I'll throw it out for you.

1153
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:10,708
I'm gonna hang on to it.

1154
00:57:10,709 --> 00:57:12,277
What?

1155
00:57:12,278 --> 00:57:14,813
What?

1156
00:57:14,814 --> 00:57:16,848
You ready for Sculley?

1157
00:57:16,849 --> 00:57:18,784
Excuse me!

1158
00:57:18,785 --> 00:57:20,685
Lisa!

1159
00:57:20,686 --> 00:57:22,588
You can't shout!

1160
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,662
(elevator bell dings)

1161
00:57:29,796 --> 00:57:31,698
Lisa?

1162
00:57:40,907 --> 00:57:43,477
You have to go.

1163
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:48,381
It's dangerous up here. That's
why I make other people do it.

1164
00:57:50,115 --> 00:57:52,451
Who are you hiding from, me or your mom?

1165
00:57:52,452 --> 00:57:56,121
I'm not hiding.

1166
00:57:56,122 --> 00:57:58,592
Let's go.

1167
00:58:05,764 --> 00:58:08,299
What were you listening to?

1168
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,870
I'm listening to two
versions of the same song.

1169
00:58:11,871 --> 00:58:15,339
Then when I get to the ends, I
rewind to listen to them again.

1170
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:18,844
It's the same song, but
the versions are different.

1171
00:58:18,845 --> 00:58:21,380
- What's the song?
- Okay.

1172
00:58:21,381 --> 00:58:24,415
So it's a really old song, and
it's called "Both Sides, Now."

1173
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:28,821
- "Both Sides, Now"?
- Yeah.

1174
00:58:28,822 --> 00:58:30,888
What's it about?

1175
00:58:30,889 --> 00:58:35,293
It's about... There are three
verses: Clouds, love and life.

1176
00:58:35,294 --> 00:58:39,998
And the person singing is singing
that they used to think of...

1177
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,866
That they used to think about...

1178
00:58:41,867 --> 00:58:44,168
- Clouds, love and life?
- Right.

1179
00:58:44,169 --> 00:58:48,040
One way, yeah, but now they look
at them another way, and they...

1180
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:53,911
They've come to the conclusion that they
really don't know clouds, love or life at all.

1181
00:58:53,912 --> 00:58:56,415
Those are the exact words.

1182
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:57,683
Yeah, Joni Mitchell.

1183
00:58:57,684 --> 00:59:01,955
'Cause it's not a really old
song, unless I'm a really old guy.

1184
00:59:03,088 --> 00:59:05,324
You have to go to school now.

1185
00:59:05,325 --> 00:59:08,527
Do you want me to tell you the
differences between the two versions?

1186
00:59:08,528 --> 00:59:09,862
Right now.

1187
00:59:09,863 --> 00:59:13,431
The first version is the kind of
thing that you would call girlish.

1188
00:59:13,432 --> 00:59:15,933
I didn't mean I want to know
the difference right now.

1189
00:59:15,934 --> 00:59:18,402
I meant you have to go to school right now.

1190
00:59:18,403 --> 00:59:20,105
I can stay and watch.

1191
00:59:20,106 --> 00:59:22,373
You are truant. You're committing a crime.

1192
00:59:22,374 --> 00:59:24,976
I'm not gonna miss anything important.

1193
00:59:24,977 --> 00:59:27,880
- How do you know?
- I read ahead.

1194
00:59:27,881 --> 00:59:31,083
The Pilgrims make it to the New World.

1195
00:59:31,084 --> 00:59:32,984
Then the Declaration of Independence.

1196
00:59:32,985 --> 00:59:35,020
Yeah, you skipped a couple centuries.

1197
00:59:35,021 --> 00:59:37,922
Steve? Chrisann's out there.

1198
00:59:37,923 --> 00:59:41,794
(audience clapping and
stomping rhythmically)

1199
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:46,330
STEVE: Let's go.

1200
00:59:46,331 --> 00:59:48,266
Can I make my case for staying?

1201
00:59:48,267 --> 00:59:50,236
Nope.

1202
00:59:51,271 --> 00:59:54,474
(clapping, stomping grow faster)

1203
01:00:08,822 --> 01:00:11,889
- She was with me.
- Come on. Your dad doesn't want us to stay.

1204
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:14,960
That's not true. That's not...

1205
01:00:14,961 --> 01:00:17,328
You have to be in school is all.

1206
01:00:17,329 --> 01:00:20,998
I'm committing a crime right now,
and I don't wanna get in trouble.

1207
01:00:20,999 --> 01:00:23,569
You're not in trouble. I was kidding.

1208
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:25,103
Okay.

1209
01:00:25,104 --> 01:00:27,605
Hey. What was the second version?

1210
01:00:27,606 --> 01:00:30,843
You said the first version was
girlish. What was the second version?

1211
01:00:32,278 --> 01:00:34,045
I can't really think of the word.

1212
01:00:34,046 --> 01:00:35,848
Okay. Well, have a good day at school.

1213
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:38,217
- Regretful.
- What?

1214
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:41,118
Like wishing you could go
back and do things different.

1215
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,388
You're too young to be regretful.

1216
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:45,891
Not me.

1217
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,627
The person singing the song.

1218
01:00:48,628 --> 01:00:52,499
Got it. Regretful. That
makes sense because...

1219
01:00:55,034 --> 01:00:57,537
(whispers) I wanna live with you.

1220
01:01:10,048 --> 01:01:12,150
Six minutes.

1221
01:01:12,151 --> 01:01:14,754
- You want to see Sculley?
- No.

1222
01:01:23,528 --> 01:01:26,931
You know all those times I
told you you needed security?

1223
01:01:26,932 --> 01:01:29,535
Here's why.

1224
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:37,442
I don't know how it is I've
gotten older and you haven't.

1225
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:40,478
Some deal with the devil
I was never offered.

1226
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:43,047
So you know what I've been
thinking for the last four years?

1227
01:01:43,048 --> 01:01:46,685
(scoffs) As it turns out, John, I've
never known what you were thinking.

1228
01:01:46,686 --> 01:01:49,453
No newborn baby has control.

1229
01:01:49,454 --> 01:01:51,389
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1230
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:53,592
In '84, before the Mac launch. You said...

1231
01:01:53,593 --> 01:01:57,161
- Yeah.
- You said that being adopted meant you didn't have control.

1232
01:01:57,162 --> 01:01:58,496
We're starting in a minute, so...

1233
01:01:58,497 --> 01:02:00,998
Why do people think I fired you?

1234
01:02:00,999 --> 01:02:03,102
It's fine, John. It's all behind us.

1235
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,107
Is it? Hmm?

1236
01:02:09,108 --> 01:02:11,745
Don't play stupid. You can't pull it off.

1237
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:16,949
You came here to ask me why
people think you fired me?

1238
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:18,985
Why do people think I fired you?

1239
01:02:20,218 --> 01:02:22,856
Just confirm something for me, okay?

1240
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,024
- You liked the ad, right?
- (chuckles)

1241
01:02:26,025 --> 01:02:27,692
The commercial... "1984." You liked it.

1242
01:02:27,693 --> 01:02:31,029
- JOHN: When are you gonna get furniture?
- It's not an easy process.

1243
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:33,130
JOHN: It is. You buy a
couch, take it from there.

1244
01:02:33,131 --> 01:02:36,634
I'd be really surprised if you came
here to talk about interior decorating.

1245
01:02:36,635 --> 01:02:38,069
I liked the ad very much.

1246
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:39,170
- You did?
- You know I did.

1247
01:02:39,171 --> 01:02:41,440
You're a lying son of a
bitch. You tried to kill it.

1248
01:02:41,441 --> 01:02:44,342
- It's time to take a hard look at the Mac.
- It's past time.

1249
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:48,513
It's overpriced. We
need to drop it to 1,995.

1250
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:50,449
We need to double the marketing budget,

1251
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:52,284
put more bodies on an internal hard drive

1252
01:02:52,285 --> 01:02:53,652
and invest in FileServer.

1253
01:02:53,653 --> 01:02:56,321
- Where the hell did you get the idea I tried to kill...
- Lee Clow.

1254
01:02:56,322 --> 01:02:58,089
- Lee's wrong.
- He's lying?

1255
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:00,257
- He's... mistaken.
- JOHN: Where would the money come from?

1256
01:03:00,258 --> 01:03:02,460
It would come from finally
getting rid of the Apple II.

1257
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:04,362
The Apple II is the
only thing making money.

1258
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:07,466
- You agreed with the board.
- I understood the board's concerns, but I...

1259
01:03:07,467 --> 01:03:09,534
The board's concerns that
we didn't show the product?

1260
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,536
- Among other things, but my question was...
- What other things?

1261
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:14,672
I'm asking because I'm curious.
You said "among other things."

1262
01:03:14,673 --> 01:03:17,442
Among other things, it was
set in a dystopian galaxy.

1263
01:03:17,443 --> 01:03:19,411
It took place on a planet
where we don't live.

1264
01:03:19,412 --> 01:03:21,446
It was dark and the opposite of our brand.

1265
01:03:21,447 --> 01:03:23,681
<i>And</i> we didn't show the product.

1266
01:03:23,682 --> 01:03:27,451
People talked about the ad but most of
them didn't know what we were selling.

1267
01:03:27,452 --> 01:03:29,487
The Mac needs to sell for 1,995.

1268
01:03:29,488 --> 01:03:33,525
There is no market research telling us
the Mac is failing because it's overpriced.

1269
01:03:33,526 --> 01:03:37,429
It's telling us that people don't like it
because they think it doesn't do anything.

1270
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:39,764
It's closed,
end-to-end.

1271
01:03:39,765 --> 01:03:42,433
We didn't know it wasn't what
people wanted, but it isn't.

1272
01:03:42,434 --> 01:03:44,502
They want slots, they want
choices, they want options.

1273
01:03:44,503 --> 01:03:46,804
The way we buy stereos...
mix and match components.

1274
01:03:46,805 --> 01:03:49,473
John, listen to me. Whoever
said the customer is always right

1275
01:03:49,474 --> 01:03:51,243
was, I promise you, a customer.

1276
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,444
- It had skinheads in it.
- She was liberating them.

1277
01:03:53,445 --> 01:03:56,580
- Liberating the skinheads.
- The ad didn't have anything to do with fucking skinheads.

1278
01:03:56,581 --> 01:03:58,350
We used them as fucking extras.

1279
01:03:58,351 --> 01:03:59,717
Nobody even knows they were skinheads.

1280
01:03:59,718 --> 01:04:02,187
I'm just saying the board had concerns...

1281
01:04:02,188 --> 01:04:04,089
You invented lifestyle advertising.

1282
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,824
And our brand was my brand.

1283
01:04:05,825 --> 01:04:08,627
My job is to make a
recommendation to the board.

1284
01:04:08,628 --> 01:04:09,995
We showed a lot of happy
people drinking Pepsi.

1285
01:04:09,996 --> 01:04:13,498
We didn't say the world was going
to end if you bought a Dr. Pepper.

1286
01:04:13,499 --> 01:04:16,268
Recommend that we drop the price
and double the marketing budget.

1287
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,770
- I can't.
- <i>And</i> we showed the product.

1288
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:22,473
We showed it being opened, we showed
it being poured, being consumed.

1289
01:04:22,474 --> 01:04:24,643
What are you gonna do,
recommend that we kill the Mac?

1290
01:04:24,644 --> 01:04:27,046
I already have, Steve.

1291
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:31,149
What? When?

1292
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:32,717
You think the secret to your success

1293
01:04:32,718 --> 01:04:35,087
was not assuming people knew
what to do with a can of soda?

1294
01:04:35,088 --> 01:04:38,489
I didn't kill the ad, Steve! I'm the
only reason it made it on the air.

1295
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:40,659
Just now. An hour ago.

1296
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:42,359
I'm coming from Markkula's house.

1297
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,362
- What did he say?
- (chuckles)

1298
01:04:45,363 --> 01:04:47,466
- What did he say?
- Invent something new.

1299
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:49,301
I'll give you a team. You can sit in Maui.

1300
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,603
The resorts come with couches.

1301
01:04:50,604 --> 01:04:55,806
Wait a minute. Are you saying you
recommended terminating the Mac

1302
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,775
or you recommended taking
me off the Mac team?

1303
01:04:57,776 --> 01:05:00,812
We bought three spots in the
Super Bowl. Two 30's and a 60.

1304
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:02,681
After we screened it, the
board wanted that money back

1305
01:05:02,682 --> 01:05:04,616
and they asked me to sell off the spots.

1306
01:05:04,617 --> 01:05:07,118
Chiat/Day sold off the
two 30's but not the 60,

1307
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:08,552
and I let it be known to Lee Clow

1308
01:05:08,553 --> 01:05:10,788
that if he didn't try very
hard to sell the last spot,

1309
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:12,424
I wouldn't be unhappy.

1310
01:05:12,425 --> 01:05:14,493
If we drop the price
and double the budget...

1311
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,228
Drop the price or double
the budget. (stammers)

1312
01:05:16,229 --> 01:05:18,763
The only way to do that is to
take money out of the Apple II.

1313
01:05:18,764 --> 01:05:21,533
The Apple II should embarrass
you. It embarrasses me.

1314
01:05:21,534 --> 01:05:23,400
It doesn't embarrass the shareholders.

1315
01:05:23,401 --> 01:05:24,768
I don't give a shit about the shareholders.

1316
01:05:24,769 --> 01:05:27,371
That's why I hired you, so I don't
have to hear about shareholders.

1317
01:05:27,372 --> 01:05:30,808
The shareholders are my problem, and
the board represents the shareholders.

1318
01:05:30,809 --> 01:05:32,676
That's how it works.

1319
01:05:32,677 --> 01:05:35,279
You sure it wasn't Lee Clow who
dragged his feet selling the 60?

1320
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,716
At my direction, Steve.

1321
01:05:37,717 --> 01:05:40,585
You think he would have done that
on his own, taken it on himself?

1322
01:05:40,586 --> 01:05:43,288
Yeah. I think he would've done
what it took to save it from you.

1323
01:05:43,289 --> 01:05:45,824
- I was the only thing protecting it.
- You didn't want the ad

1324
01:05:45,825 --> 01:05:48,859
because you were trying to kill the
Mac two months before it launched.

1325
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:51,063
You are fucking delusional.

1326
01:05:52,731 --> 01:05:53,831
(sighs)

1327
01:05:53,832 --> 01:05:55,699
- Can I mention something to you?
- Sure.

1328
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,271
I have no earthly idea why you're here.

1329
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:03,174
The story of why and how you left Apple,

1330
01:06:03,175 --> 01:06:05,911
which is quickly becoming
mythologized, isn't true.

1331
01:06:05,912 --> 01:06:08,413
- I'm gonna take this to the board myself.
- Don't do that.

1332
01:06:08,414 --> 01:06:10,181
- I <i>am</i> doing that.
- You can't.

1333
01:06:10,182 --> 01:06:12,817
Why?

1334
01:06:12,818 --> 01:06:16,122
They believe you're no longer
necessary to this company.

1335
01:06:20,425 --> 01:06:25,563
I get hate mail, death threats.

1336
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:29,201
I get death threats.

1337
01:06:29,202 --> 01:06:33,072
My kids are getting taunted.
Why do people think I fired you?

1338
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:36,942
Joanna's gonna call my name in a second.

1339
01:06:36,943 --> 01:06:38,810
- JOANNA: Steve?
- That was unrehearsed.

1340
01:06:38,811 --> 01:06:40,511
Yeah, I'll be there in just a second.

1341
01:06:40,512 --> 01:06:42,746
I gave you your day in court.

1342
01:06:42,747 --> 01:06:44,348
- You gave me?
- I gave the board a clear choice.

1343
01:06:44,349 --> 01:06:47,953
I said, "Do you want to invest in the Apple
II or the Mac?" They chose the Apple II.

1344
01:06:47,954 --> 01:06:50,288
The same people who wanted
to dump the Super Bowl spot.

1345
01:06:50,289 --> 01:06:52,358
And then I got on a plane to China.

1346
01:06:53,892 --> 01:06:56,427
Mr. Sculley. There's a
call for you on Line One.

1347
01:06:56,428 --> 01:06:59,697
Or I almost got on a plane,
because I got a call in the lounge.

1348
01:06:59,698 --> 01:07:01,433
- Who made that call?
- Doesn't matter.

1349
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,967
STEVE: <i>It matters to
me. Who made the call?</i>

1350
01:07:02,968 --> 01:07:04,168
John Sculley.

1351
01:07:04,169 --> 01:07:06,004
MAN (on phone): <i>John? If
you get on that plane,</i>

1352
01:07:06,005 --> 01:07:08,906
<i>you'll have lost your
job by the time it lands.</i>

1353
01:07:08,907 --> 01:07:12,509
<i>Steve's been calling the
board. He wants you out.</i>

1354
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:15,513
JOHN: <i>I left my bags on the plane.
My shit's still somewhere in Beijing.</i>

1355
01:07:15,514 --> 01:07:18,549
I took a car back to Cupertino in
the middle of the fucking night.

1356
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:23,355
I know what time it is. I need a quorum
here in one hour and I want Steve here too.

1357
01:07:23,356 --> 01:07:25,857
STEVE: <i>You took me off the
Mac, and it was bad business.</i>

1358
01:07:25,858 --> 01:07:28,726
- The quorum call was a homicide.
- Right there! Right there.

1359
01:07:28,727 --> 01:07:30,462
That's the part that's bullshit, my friend.

1360
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:31,929
It was a suicide.

1361
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:34,665
Because you knew your
cards and I showed you mine.

1362
01:07:34,666 --> 01:07:37,534
I showed you mine, and you did it anyway.

1363
01:07:37,535 --> 01:07:38,937
What did you think I was gonna do?

1364
01:07:38,938 --> 01:07:41,605
I'm okay losing, but I'm not gonna forfeit.

1365
01:07:41,606 --> 01:07:44,308
I'm not okay losing.

1366
01:07:44,309 --> 01:07:46,745
JOHN: <i>We're losing market share,
and the Mac is losing money.</i>

1367
01:07:46,746 --> 01:07:51,949
Our only hope is the Apple II, which is stagnating
because of its soon-to-be-obsolete DOS.

1368
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:55,386
Users are already rigging their machines
to run with a CP/M operating system

1369
01:07:55,387 --> 01:07:56,755
that's been built to run on Intel.

1370
01:07:56,756 --> 01:07:58,857
I can't put it more simply than this.

1371
01:07:58,858 --> 01:08:01,859
We need to put our resources
into updating the Apple II.

1372
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:04,562
STEVE: <i>By taking
resources from the Mac.</i>

1373
01:08:04,563 --> 01:08:05,964
JOHN: <i>It's failing. That's a fact.</i>

1374
01:08:05,965 --> 01:08:07,998
- It's overpriced.
- There's no evidence that it's...

1375
01:08:07,999 --> 01:08:09,900
I'm the evidence!

1376
01:08:09,901 --> 01:08:13,772
I'm the world's leading expert on
the Mac, John. What's your résumé?

1377
01:08:13,773 --> 01:08:15,706
You're issuing contradictory instructions,

1378
01:08:15,707 --> 01:08:17,709
you're insubordinate,
you make people miserable.

1379
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:20,844
Our top engineers are
fleeing to Sun, Dell, HP.

1380
01:08:20,845 --> 01:08:22,981
<i>Wall Street doesn't know
who's driving the bus.</i>

1381
01:08:22,982 --> 01:08:25,049
We've lost hundreds of millions in value.

1382
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:28,686
And I'm the CEO of Apple,
Steve. That's my résumé.

1383
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:31,522
But before that, you sold
carbonated sugar water, right?

1384
01:08:31,523 --> 01:08:35,427
I sat in a fucking garage with
Wozniak and invented the future.

1385
01:08:35,428 --> 01:08:38,862
Because artists lead and
hacks ask for a show of hands.

1386
01:08:38,863 --> 01:08:39,864
All right.

1387
01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:41,865
Well, this guy's out of control.

1388
01:08:41,866 --> 01:08:44,602
I'm perfectly willing to hand
in my resignation tonight,

1389
01:08:44,603 --> 01:08:46,538
but if you want me to
stay, you can't have Steve.

1390
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,740
Settle him out.

1391
01:08:48,741 --> 01:08:51,843
He can keep a share of stock
so he gets our newsletter.

1392
01:08:51,844 --> 01:08:54,478
<i>He'll have to sever his
connection to Apple.</i>

1393
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:58,384
I'm dead serious. I want the
secretary to call for a vote.

1394
01:08:59,985 --> 01:09:03,088
I fucking dare you.

1395
01:09:03,089 --> 01:09:08,759
You have done an outstanding job over
the years of cultivating the press.

1396
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,294
And by that, I mean manipulating them.

1397
01:09:10,295 --> 01:09:13,932
Because none of them, none of their
editors, none of their editors' publishers

1398
01:09:13,933 --> 01:09:16,066
to this day know that you forced it,

1399
01:09:16,067 --> 01:09:18,035
<i>that you forced the board.</i>

1400
01:09:18,036 --> 01:09:20,371
<i>Even after I told you
exactly what they'd do,</i>

1401
01:09:20,372 --> 01:09:22,473
which is exactly what they did.

1402
01:09:22,474 --> 01:09:24,875
Unanimously.

1403
01:09:24,876 --> 01:09:27,579
I don't have any trouble
remembering that, John,

1404
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:31,048
because of it being the
worst night of my life.

1405
01:09:31,049 --> 01:09:34,151
And I forced the vote because
I believed I was right.

1406
01:09:34,152 --> 01:09:37,289
- I still believe I'm right. And I'm right.
- (mutters)

1407
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:40,525
Now I bled that night.

1408
01:09:40,526 --> 01:09:42,694
<i>And I don't bleed.</i>

1409
01:09:42,695 --> 01:09:44,396
<i>But time's done its thing,</i>

1410
01:09:44,397 --> 01:09:46,998
<i>and I really haven't
thought about it in a while.</i>

1411
01:09:46,999 --> 01:09:51,669
Now, I absolutely
understand why you're upset.

1412
01:09:51,670 --> 01:09:53,737
<i>And I want people to
know the truth too.</i>

1413
01:09:53,738 --> 01:09:55,839
JOANNA: It's time.

1414
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,741
Got it.

1415
01:09:57,742 --> 01:09:59,843
You're gonna end me, aren't you?

1416
01:09:59,844 --> 01:10:02,112
STEVE: You're being ridiculous.

1417
01:10:02,113 --> 01:10:05,482
I'm gonna sit center court
and watch you do it yourself.

1418
01:10:05,483 --> 01:10:09,119
Then I'm gonna order a nice meal with
a '55 Margaux and sign some autographs.

1419
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,856
- Jesus Christ.
- You want some advice, Pepsi Generation?

1420
01:10:11,857 --> 01:10:14,592
Don't send Woz out to slap
me around in the press.

1421
01:10:14,593 --> 01:10:17,195
Anybody else... you, Markkula, Arthur Rock.

1422
01:10:17,196 --> 01:10:18,896
Anyone but Rain Man.

1423
01:10:18,897 --> 01:10:21,432
Don't manipulate him like that.

1424
01:10:21,433 --> 01:10:25,102
Whatever you may think, I'm
always gonna protect him.

1425
01:10:25,103 --> 01:10:27,205
Come on, Steve.

1426
01:10:28,573 --> 01:10:31,176
That's what men do.

1427
01:10:31,177 --> 01:10:33,512
- We can't start late.
- (mutters)

1428
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:48,494
I don't think there was any way
to detect a chip on my shoulder.

1429
01:10:49,795 --> 01:10:51,295
Did you know, back at Bandley,

1430
01:10:51,296 --> 01:10:55,600
the Mac team gave an award every year
to the person who could stand up to you?

1431
01:10:55,601 --> 01:10:56,734
No.

1432
01:10:56,735 --> 01:11:01,573
- I won. Three years in a row.
- Cool.

1433
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:06,811
This.

1434
01:11:06,812 --> 01:11:10,882
This... This Guy Kawasaki
in <i>Macworld.</i>

1435
01:11:10,883 --> 01:11:13,651
He accidentally got it right, didn't he?

1436
01:11:13,652 --> 01:11:15,219
You've been dragging
your feet on the NeXT OS

1437
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:18,623
till you can figure out
what Apple's gonna need.

1438
01:11:18,624 --> 01:11:20,158
(clicks tongue)

1439
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:23,828
Even if that were true, it doesn't
sound that diabolical to me.

1440
01:11:23,829 --> 01:11:25,530
WOMAN: Hey. We're ready for you.

1441
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:28,167
(rumbling)

1442
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,543
I'm your closest confidante,
your... your best friend.

1443
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:41,713
Your thing... What do you call it?

1444
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,882
Your work wife. The whole time.

1445
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:45,883
The last three years.

1446
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:47,887
(rumbling continues)

1447
01:11:49,921 --> 01:11:55,660
When did you change your mind and start
building the Steve Jobs Revenge Machine?

1448
01:11:55,661 --> 01:11:58,629
(sighs)

1449
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:00,697
- House to half.
- (rumbling fades)

1450
01:12:00,698 --> 01:12:03,302
You remember Skylab?

1451
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:10,941
It was an unmanned satellite NASA sent up in
the early '70s on a data gathering mission.

1452
01:12:10,942 --> 01:12:13,611
The thing is, when they sent it up,

1453
01:12:13,612 --> 01:12:16,146
they didn't know yet how
they were gonna get it back.

1454
01:12:16,147 --> 01:12:18,182
But they felt like they were close enough

1455
01:12:18,183 --> 01:12:21,619
<i>that in the eight years it was gonna
be up there, they'd figure it out.</i>

1456
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:23,087
WOMAN: They're on their way now.

1457
01:12:23,088 --> 01:12:25,822
They didn't.

1458
01:12:25,823 --> 01:12:27,892
So after eight years, it came crashing down

1459
01:12:27,893 --> 01:12:30,561
in a thousand-mile swath
across the Indian Ocean.

1460
01:12:30,562 --> 01:12:32,996
- (audience cheering)
- <i>A little to the left, a little to the right,</i>

1461
01:12:32,997 --> 01:12:34,966
<i>somebody could have gotten hurt.</i>

1462
01:12:34,967 --> 01:12:39,102
I really wanted to build
a computer for colleges.

1463
01:12:39,103 --> 01:12:41,705
The technology just didn't catch
up as fast as I needed it to.

1464
01:12:41,706 --> 01:12:43,975
<i>You know we're out of money.</i>

1465
01:12:43,976 --> 01:12:46,276
MAN (on PA): <i>Ladies and gentlemen, the
program will be starting momentarily.</i>

1466
01:12:46,277 --> 01:12:49,580
STEVE: <i>But then Apple stopped
innovating, and I saw something better.</i>

1467
01:12:49,581 --> 01:12:54,718
Joanna, I know schools aren't gonna buy
a $13,000 dictionary with good speakers.

1468
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:56,755
You know I know that.

1469
01:12:58,590 --> 01:13:00,258
But Apple will.

1470
01:13:00,259 --> 01:13:03,828
'Cause Avie Tevanian is gonna
build them exactly the OS they need.

1471
01:13:03,829 --> 01:13:06,731
<i>They're gonna have to buy me too.</i>

1472
01:13:06,732 --> 01:13:12,671
For half a billion dollars in stock
and end-to-end control on every product.

1473
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:16,642
(scoffs)

1474
01:13:19,178 --> 01:13:22,648
(applause continues)

1475
01:13:30,356 --> 01:13:32,457
(no audible dialogue)

1476
01:13:43,402 --> 01:13:47,372
WOMAN: Ladies and
gentlemen, please welcome...

1477
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:54,277
FEMALE REPORTER: <i>More than a year after it
was first unveiled to industry insiders,</i>

1478

<i>the NeXT Computer is
finally available in stores.</i>

1479

two strikes in a row for Steve Jobs.</i>

1480
01:14:00,753 --> 01:14:02,186
MALE REPORTER #2:
<i>Students and educators</i>

1481

justify the machine's high cost.</i>

1482
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:07,191
FEMALE REPORTER #2: <i>So
much for the black cube.</i>

1483
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:12,129
<i>NeXT just sold its factory to Canon
and laid off half its employees.</i>

1484
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:15,165
In the world of computers,
it's kill or be killed.

1485
01:14:15,166 --> 01:14:17,301
Apple Computer has fallen on hard times.

1486
01:14:17,302 --> 01:14:20,103
It is laying off about 2,500 people.

1487
01:14:20,104 --> 01:14:22,306
FEMALE REPORTER #3: <i>Apple is

<i>with no new innovations in the

01:14:30,948 --> 01:14:32,417
<i>But then again, maybe you don't.</i>

1492
01:14:32,418 --> 01:14:35,753
MALE REPORTER #4: <i>It turns
handwriting into computer text.</i>

1493
01:14:35,754 --> 01:14:39,692
Hey, Dolph, take a memo on
your Newton. "Beat up Martin."

1494
01:14:41,393 --> 01:14:43,261
- Bah!
- (yelps)

1495
01:14:43,262 --> 01:14:46,030
FEMALE REPORTER #4: <i>In 1980,
Apple had 30% of the market.</i>

1496
01:14:46,031 --> 01:14:48,766
<i>Today, Apple has only 3.2 percent.</i>

1497
01:14:48,767 --> 01:14:52,604
MALE REPORTER #5: <i>That's it. John
Sculley has been fired from Apple.</i>

1498
01:14:53,938 --> 01:14:56,708
DAVID LETTERMAN: What about this Internet
thing? Do you know anything about that?

1499
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:59,444
It is the big new thing.

1500
01:14:59,445 --> 01:15:02,079
Rumors are flying around
Apple Computer once again

1501
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,714
over who will take over the helm.

1502
01:15:03,715 --> 01:15:06,383
In the news at this hour, a
remarkable high-tech reunion.

1503
01:15:06,384 --> 01:15:09,020
FEMALE REPORTER #5: <i>Well, it's
happening. In a billion-dollar shakeup,</i>

1504
01:15:09,021 --> 01:15:12,123
<i>Apple is purchasing NeXT Computer's
operating system, which may mean...</i>

1505
01:15:12,124 --> 01:15:14,726
- MALE REPORTER #6: <i>Is the prodigal son returning?</i>
- FEMALE REPORTER #6: <i>Bet on it.</i>

1506
01:15:14,727 --> 01:15:16,861
Guess what. Mac is back.

1507
01:15:16,862 --> 01:15:18,428
- Apple cofounder Steven Jobs...
- Steve Jobs...

1508
01:15:18,429 --> 01:15:20,330
- Steve Jobs...
- Steve Jobs...
- Steve Jobs...

1509
01:15:20,331 --> 01:15:22,901
FEMALE REPORTER #7: <i>Steve
Jobs is returning to Apple.</i>

1510
01:15:24,469 --> 01:15:27,472
STEVE: <i>If you want to beam your digital
photographs from your digital camera,</i>

1511
01:15:27,473 --> 01:15:29,173
<i>it's built into every product.</i>

1512
01:15:29,174 --> 01:15:31,275
<i>We're going to the
new generation of I/O.</i>

1513
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:34,178
Twelve megabyte USB. Two ports.

1514
01:15:34,179 --> 01:15:36,748
We're leaving the old Apple I/O behind.

1515
01:15:36,749 --> 01:15:39,383
Stereo surround sound
built into every product,

1516
01:15:39,384 --> 01:15:43,353
a great keyboard and the
coolest mouse you've ever seen.

1517
01:15:43,354 --> 01:15:47,424
- This time, we used actual mice.
- (laughter)

1518
01:15:47,425 --> 01:15:50,895
We're opening the house
in 10 minutes. Steven?

1519
01:15:50,896 --> 01:15:52,530
Do you want to stop horsing around?

1520
01:15:52,531 --> 01:15:57,000
Bless my eyes. That's Steve
Wozniak sitting out there.

1521
01:15:57,001 --> 01:16:00,003
(applause, cheering)

1522
01:16:00,004 --> 01:16:03,441
Give yourselves a treat and ask Woz
if he happens to have the correct time.

1523
01:16:03,442 --> 01:16:07,410
- (laughter)
- I have the correct time, and we're running out of it.

1524
01:16:07,411 --> 01:16:11,348
- "A great keyboard"...
- A great keyboard and the coolest mouse you've ever seen.

1525
01:16:11,349 --> 01:16:14,785
- This is what those things look like today.
- (all groaning)

1526
01:16:14,786 --> 01:16:19,456
Now, I'd like to show you what
they're gonna look like tomorrow.

1527
01:16:19,457 --> 01:16:22,360
This is the iMac.

1528
01:16:22,361 --> 01:16:24,962
(applause, cheering)

1529
01:16:24,963 --> 01:16:27,700
<i>♪♪ (instrumental on speakers)</i>

1530
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:44,782
(applause, cheering continue)

1531
01:16:51,823 --> 01:16:53,324
- <i>♪♪ (ends)</i>
- That was cool.

1532
01:16:53,325 --> 01:16:55,426
Why did I like that
better than I usually do?

1533
01:16:55,427 --> 01:16:57,494
- JOANNA: I don't know.
- Something was different.

1534
01:16:57,495 --> 01:16:59,196
ANDREA: Hey, stupid.

1535
01:16:59,197 --> 01:17:01,432
I think she's talking to one of you guys.

1536
01:17:01,433 --> 01:17:04,235
- Did you notice a difference?
- That's what I'm...

1537
01:17:04,236 --> 01:17:06,937
The exit signs were off.

1538
01:17:06,938 --> 01:17:09,472
- Full blackout.
- You did it.

1539
01:17:09,473 --> 01:17:11,843
We wired all the exit lights to our board.

1540
01:17:11,844 --> 01:17:14,378
They go out with the cue for seven
seconds then come back on again. In theory.

1541
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:18,115
- We think that's legal?
- No, we're very certain it's not.

1542
01:17:18,116 --> 01:17:20,484
- You want to see some quotes?
- Let's hold off on those.

1543
01:17:20,485 --> 01:17:22,253
- No, he'll like 'em.
- (mouths word)

1544
01:17:22,254 --> 01:17:25,758
- I'll show 'em to you later.
- I'll take 'em now.

1545
01:17:27,159 --> 01:17:29,227
- I'm sorry.
- Pick it up from there, please.

1546
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:31,995
We only have a couple of
minutes, so let's just do the 360.

1547
01:17:31,996 --> 01:17:35,399
STEVE: We're gonna bring out a
wireless camera we stole from Panasonic.

1548
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,535
- (laughter)
- I'll show you what this looks like.

1549
01:17:38,536 --> 01:17:41,438
The whole thing is translucent.
You can see into it.

1550
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:43,975
- (people muttering)
- How's that for a compromise, Woz?

1551
01:17:43,976 --> 01:17:47,544
- You still can't get into it, but you can see into it.
- Fair enough.

1552
01:17:47,545 --> 01:17:51,315
We put stereo speakers in
front, infrared right up here,

1553
01:17:51,316 --> 01:17:53,284
CD-ROM drive in the middle.

1554
01:17:53,285 --> 01:17:56,020
- (audience) Nice.
- Dual stereo headphone jacks.

1555
01:17:56,021 --> 01:17:59,257
All the connectors are inside
one beautiful little door here.

1556
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:02,593
- (oohing and aahing)
- Ethernet. USB.

1557
01:18:02,594 --> 01:18:05,096
Even though this is a
full-blooded Macintosh,

1558
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:06,931
we're targeting it for the number one use

1559
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:09,432
the consumers tell us they
want a computer for, which is...

1560
01:18:09,433 --> 01:18:11,602
Let's hold it, please. Hold it.

1561
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:14,571
- The answer was "the Internet."
- (laughter)

1562
01:18:14,572 --> 01:18:16,674
- Joanna?
- Yeah.

1563
01:18:17,808 --> 01:18:21,145
Stand in front of me. I want to look at these
quotes, but I don't want Joel to know.

1564
01:18:21,146 --> 01:18:23,349
They're all great.

1565
01:18:25,049 --> 01:18:28,151
"It is not only the coolest-looking
computer introduced in years

1566
01:18:28,152 --> 01:18:29,587
but a chest-thumping statement

1567
01:18:29,588 --> 01:18:34,727
that Silicon Valley's original dream
company is no longer somnambulant."

1568
01:18:36,394 --> 01:18:37,861
It's a word. It means "sleepwalking."

1569
01:18:37,862 --> 01:18:41,499
Steve? I'm sorry. We have to clear
the house if we're gonna start on time.

1570
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,467
- We're gonna start on time.
- We're absolutely starting on time.

1571
01:18:43,468 --> 01:18:45,002
Here. Take this.

1572
01:18:45,003 --> 01:18:49,173
Everybody, that's it. They've got to
mop the stage, reset and open the house.

1573
01:18:49,174 --> 01:18:50,708
I love you guys.

1574
01:18:50,709 --> 01:18:54,580
(applause, cheering)

1575
01:18:58,951 --> 01:19:00,651
Andy, come on back a minute.

1576
01:19:00,652 --> 01:19:02,955
- Which one?
- Hertzfeld.

1577
01:19:09,428 --> 01:19:13,431
<i>Forbes</i> calls it an
"industry-altering success."

1578
01:19:13,432 --> 01:19:15,634
Look here.

1579
01:19:18,036 --> 01:19:20,236
Why haven't we ever slept together?

1580
01:19:20,237 --> 01:19:22,106
We're not in love. Look.

1581
01:19:24,175 --> 01:19:27,011
- Sculley.
- Look what he said.

1582
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:32,383
"He has implemented the same simple strategy
that made Apple so successful 15 years ago...

1583
01:19:32,384 --> 01:19:35,621
make hit products and promote
them with terrific marketing."

1584
01:19:36,722 --> 01:19:39,190
- It was nice of him.
- It was.

1585
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:40,691
I meant it.

1586
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:44,261
Sightings of J.D. Salinger are
more common than John Sculley.

1587
01:19:44,262 --> 01:19:47,933
I wasn't being sarcastic.
It was nice of him.

1588
01:19:49,067 --> 01:19:51,134
- Do you talk to him?
- No.

1589
01:19:51,135 --> 01:19:53,169
You haven't talked to him since '88?

1590
01:19:53,170 --> 01:19:55,705
I'd have told you if I did.

1591
01:19:55,706 --> 01:19:57,141
Doesn't matter.

1592
01:19:57,142 --> 01:19:58,476
I don't want people
thinking they can cross me

1593
01:19:58,477 --> 01:20:02,178
- (snaps fingers)
- and then, boom, 15 years later, I'm cool with it.

1594
01:20:02,179 --> 01:20:05,182
I was kidding.

1595
01:20:05,183 --> 01:20:07,719
What's wrong with you this morning?

1596
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:11,089
Let's get off the stage.

1597
01:20:12,656 --> 01:20:15,759
"The only thing Apple's providing
now is leadership in colors."

1598
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,460
Don't worry about it.

1599
01:20:17,461 --> 01:20:19,562
- What does Bill Gates have against me?
- I don't know.

1600
01:20:19,563 --> 01:20:22,466
You're both out of your
minds. Listen to me.

1601
01:20:22,467 --> 01:20:24,535
He dropped out of a better
school than I dropped out of.

1602
01:20:24,536 --> 01:20:26,404
But he's a tool bag. I'll tell you why.

1603
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:29,139
Make everything all right with Lisa.

1604
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:32,343
You know, Joanna? Boundaries.

1605
01:20:32,344 --> 01:20:35,311
You've come to my apartment
at 1:00 AM and cleaned it.

1606
01:20:35,312 --> 01:20:36,713
So tell me where the boundary is.

1607
01:20:36,714 --> 01:20:38,649
- There. Let's say it's there.
- (sighs)

1608
01:20:38,650 --> 01:20:41,685
If I give you some real projections,

1609
01:20:41,686 --> 01:20:45,489
will you promise not to
repeat them from the stage?

1610
01:20:45,490 --> 01:20:48,526
What do you mean, "real projections"?

1611
01:20:48,527 --> 01:20:52,495
- What have you been giving me?
- Conservative projections.

1612
01:20:52,496 --> 01:20:54,130
Marketing's been lying to me?

1613
01:20:54,131 --> 01:20:57,802
We've been managing expectations
so that you don't not.

1614
01:20:57,803 --> 01:21:00,138
What are the real projections?

1615
01:21:01,406 --> 01:21:04,275
We're gonna sell a million
units in the first 90 days.

1616
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:06,209
- (strikes table)
- 20,000 a month after that.

1617
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:07,611
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

1618
01:21:07,612 --> 01:21:09,346
You see? You wait long enough and...

1619
01:21:09,347 --> 01:21:11,749
What's more, 32% of the sales

1620
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:15,785
are going to go to people buying
a computer for the first time.

1621
01:21:15,786 --> 01:21:20,490
And 12% are going to people using
some kind of Windows machine.

1622
01:21:20,491 --> 01:21:23,227
That's what Bill Gates has against you.

1623
01:21:24,696 --> 01:21:28,066
And it'll be the fastest-selling
computer in history.

1624
01:21:29,433 --> 01:21:31,468
You brought the company
back from life support

1625
01:21:31,469 --> 01:21:34,538
after going through the misery
of laying off 3,000 people

1626
01:21:34,539 --> 01:21:36,774
and cutting 70% of the product line.

1627
01:21:36,775 --> 01:21:40,178
So, Steven, it's over.

1628
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:44,280
You're gonna win.

1629
01:21:44,281 --> 01:21:48,384
- It would be criminal not to enjoy this moment.
- I'm enjoying it.

1630
01:21:48,385 --> 01:21:50,420
Make things all right with Lisa.

1631
01:21:50,421 --> 01:21:52,655
- You know...
- Come on.

1632
01:21:52,656 --> 01:21:56,326
I don't like having less
privacy than other people have.

1633
01:21:56,327 --> 01:21:59,896
- Does being a multi-billionaire take some of the sting off that?
- No.

1634
01:21:59,897 --> 01:22:03,133
- All Lisa did...
- All Lisa did was give her blessing.

1635
01:22:03,134 --> 01:22:06,669
- Chrisann sold the house and...
- And Lisa could have done what?

1636
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:09,272
How was she supposed to stop her
mother from selling her own house?

1637
01:22:09,273 --> 01:22:10,673
That I bought for the two of them.

1638
01:22:10,674 --> 01:22:12,008
How was she supposed to stop her?

1639
01:22:12,009 --> 01:22:15,612
Voicing an objection would have
been a step in the right direction.

1640
01:22:15,613 --> 01:22:18,315
You don't think you're
having a bizarre overreaction

1641
01:22:18,316 --> 01:22:21,819
to a 19-year-old girl allowing
her mother to list her own house?

1642
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:23,053
She could've tried.

1643
01:22:23,054 --> 01:22:26,757
Was she supposed to stop her
mother, that particular mother...

1644
01:22:26,758 --> 01:22:29,826
She gave Chrisann her blessing to sell
the house and she did it to spite me.

1645
01:22:29,827 --> 01:22:33,864
I don't care if she put a
pipe bomb in the water heater.

1646
01:22:33,865 --> 01:22:36,667
You're going to fix it, now.

1647
01:22:36,668 --> 01:22:39,736
She's been acting weird for
months. She's turned on me.

1648
01:22:39,737 --> 01:22:41,804
- Fix it.
- What the...

1649
01:22:41,805 --> 01:22:43,440
Fix it, Steve.

1650
01:22:43,441 --> 01:22:44,941
- Take it easy.
- Fix it or I quit.

1651
01:22:44,942 --> 01:22:47,178
How about that? I quit,
and you never see me again.

1652
01:22:47,179 --> 01:22:49,114
How about that?

1653
01:22:50,581 --> 01:22:53,551
Tell me what's wrong with you this morning.

1654
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:56,920
What's been wrong with me for 19 years.

1655
01:22:56,921 --> 01:22:58,888
(weeping)

1656
01:22:58,889 --> 01:23:02,860
I've been a witness, and I
tell you, I've been complicit.

1657
01:23:04,362 --> 01:23:08,365
I love you, Steve. You know how much.

1658
01:23:08,366 --> 01:23:13,369
I love that you don't care how much money a
person makes. You care <i>what</i> they make.

1659
01:23:13,370 --> 01:23:17,208
But what you make isn't supposed
to be the best part of you.

1660
01:23:17,209 --> 01:23:19,810
When you're a father,

1661
01:23:19,811 --> 01:23:22,413
that's what's supposed to
be the best part of you.

1662
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:27,251
And it's caused me two decades of
agony, Steve, that it is for you

1663
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,821
the worst.

1664
01:23:31,822 --> 01:23:37,329
(sighs) It's a little thing.
It's a very small thing.

1665
01:23:38,495 --> 01:23:40,830
(sniffles) Fix it.

1666
01:23:40,831 --> 01:23:46,236
Fix it now, or you can
contact me at my new job...

1667
01:23:46,237 --> 01:23:49,206
working anywhere I want.

1668
01:23:50,709 --> 01:23:52,977
I don't happen to think it is
a little deal. She knew that...

1669
01:23:52,978 --> 01:23:55,378
- No.
- I bought the house for the two of...

1670
01:23:55,379 --> 01:23:56,746
- No.
- What do you mean, "no"?

1671
01:23:56,747 --> 01:24:01,884
I mean no. The house has nothing
to do with why you're angry at Lisa.

1672
01:24:01,885 --> 01:24:04,887
I assure you, the house has everything
to do with why I'm angry at Lisa.

1673
01:24:04,888 --> 01:24:09,560
Have you ever heard the phrase
"reality distortion field"?

1674
01:24:09,561 --> 01:24:13,731
- Yes.
- As in "Steve's reality distortion field"?

1675
01:24:13,732 --> 01:24:16,633
I've heard it. I've read it.
It's been sung to me by Joan Baez.

1676
01:24:16,634 --> 01:24:18,401
What you call a reality distortion field,

1677
01:24:18,402 --> 01:24:20,704
and I'm pretty sure you're
the one who coined the phrase,

1678
01:24:20,705 --> 01:24:22,740
- is the reason we're here.
- I know that.

1679
01:24:22,741 --> 01:24:25,042
If I traded in my bank account for a dollar

1680
01:24:25,043 --> 01:24:27,878
every time somebody told me something
was impossible, I'd come out ahead.

1681
01:24:27,879 --> 01:24:29,913
- I know that too.
- What's the problem?

1682
01:24:29,914 --> 01:24:32,915
- My problem? It sure isn't the house.
- Jo, I...

1683
01:24:32,916 --> 01:24:37,387
It's that you told her you
weren't going to pay for Harvard.

1684
01:24:37,388 --> 01:24:39,423
That child.

1685
01:24:39,424 --> 01:24:41,825
That earnest, unironic kid.

1686
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:43,826
She told you I wasn't paying her tuition?

1687
01:24:43,827 --> 01:24:46,496
I should have hit you with
something heavy a long time ago.

1688
01:24:46,497 --> 01:24:49,033
Lisa told you I wasn't paying her tuition?

1689
01:24:49,034 --> 01:24:53,303
- Andy told me that.
- Which one?

1690
01:24:53,304 --> 01:24:55,371
Hertzfeld.

1691
01:24:55,372 --> 01:24:56,874
How would Hertzfeld know?

1692
01:24:56,875 --> 01:25:00,910
He wrote Harvard a check for
25,000 to cover the semester.

1693
01:25:00,911 --> 01:25:03,847
Are you fucking... He paid her tuition?

1694
01:25:03,848 --> 01:25:06,717
Isn't that why you just asked to see him?

1695
01:25:06,718 --> 01:25:08,319
No, I asked to see him about something...

1696
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:11,722
Did you tell her you weren't
going to pay for college?

1697
01:25:11,723 --> 01:25:13,723
- Yes, because...
- How could you do that?

1698
01:25:13,724 --> 01:25:16,959
Because her mother, who
is also her landlord...

1699
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,928
Hertzfeld? I was ranting.

1700
01:25:18,929 --> 01:25:21,498
I was just, you know... I was
talking. You think I would...

1701
01:25:21,499 --> 01:25:25,602
I was pissed off because Lisa
was trying to piss me off, Joanna.

1702
01:25:25,603 --> 01:25:27,003
That was her intent. I don't know...

1703
01:25:27,004 --> 01:25:29,572
You obviously scared the hell out of her.

1704
01:25:29,573 --> 01:25:33,144
Hertzfeld wrote a check
to Harvard, pay for...

1705
01:25:34,345 --> 01:25:35,978
- Is she here yet?
- I'm sure she is.

1706
01:25:35,979 --> 01:25:38,348
Can you have someone bring her back?

1707
01:25:38,349 --> 01:25:40,084
Yes.

1708
01:25:40,085 --> 01:25:41,485
(exhales)

1709
01:25:41,486 --> 01:25:43,421
Thank you.

1710
01:25:46,825 --> 01:25:48,559
You know,

1711
01:25:49,994 --> 01:25:51,695
my grandmother always used to say to me...

1712
01:25:51,696 --> 01:25:54,131
I don't give a shit, Yentl.

1713
01:25:55,733 --> 01:25:57,767
- I'll have someone get Lisa.
- Thank you.

1714
01:25:57,768 --> 01:26:00,036
- And if you see Hertzfeld...
- (knocking)

1715
01:26:00,037 --> 01:26:01,972
HERTZFELD: It's Andy.

1716
01:26:01,973 --> 01:26:05,109
Speak of the devil's chief engineer.

1717
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:06,377
Go.

1718
01:26:06,378 --> 01:26:08,412
Come on in.

1719
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:12,383
You look great today.

1720
01:26:12,384 --> 01:26:13,851
- Thank you.
- Doesn't she?

1721
01:26:13,852 --> 01:26:17,488
She looks fantastic. Always does. Get out.

1722
01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:21,991
- Well, I think I know why I'm here.
- Do you?

1723
01:26:21,992 --> 01:26:22,726
Steve...

1724
01:26:22,727 --> 01:26:25,596
- Did you send the check yet?
- Yes.

1725
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:28,831
So Harvard got a tuition check
from Andy Hertzfeld to pay for Lisa?

1726
01:26:28,832 --> 01:26:30,868
I don't think they look that carefully.

1727
01:26:30,869 --> 01:26:33,771
I don't think they'd notice
the check didn't come from you.

1728
01:26:33,772 --> 01:26:36,673
Close one. This was
almost embarrassing for me.

1729
01:26:36,674 --> 01:26:38,609
(sighs) I understand how...

1730
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:40,177
I'll wire you the money today.

1731
01:26:40,178 --> 01:26:43,746
I-I understand how you feel.
And I do apologize. I do.

1732
01:26:43,747 --> 01:26:46,016
But let me tell you my thinking.

1733
01:26:46,017 --> 01:26:48,685
I can't even think of an appropriate
analogy to describe what you did.

1734
01:26:48,686 --> 01:26:51,187
I knew you guys would
fix things. You always do.

1735
01:26:51,188 --> 01:26:54,991
But in the meantime, if the money wasn't
there, she'd miss a semester of school.

1736
01:26:54,992 --> 01:26:58,728
- Yeah.
- And she'd have to tell her friends why.

1737
01:26:58,729 --> 01:27:01,197
And she needed things. She needed socks.

1738
01:27:01,198 --> 01:27:05,436
- What?
- It's cold in Cambridge. She needed warm socks.

1739
01:27:05,437 --> 01:27:10,206
- You gave her socks?
- Well, I gave her money for socks.

1740
01:27:10,207 --> 01:27:13,509
You don't get to deputize
yourself as her interim.

1741
01:27:13,510 --> 01:27:15,945
You don't get to override my
decisions. Do you understand?

1742
01:27:15,946 --> 01:27:18,115
You don't get to act
like you're her father.

1743
01:27:18,116 --> 01:27:20,683
Somebody had to.

1744
01:27:20,684 --> 01:27:22,785
What the fuck did you just say to me?

1745
01:27:22,786 --> 01:27:26,656
I've known her since she was six.

1746
01:27:26,657 --> 01:27:28,859
I also consider...

1747
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:34,130
Chrisann's my friend, outside of what
you and I... outside of our relationship.

1748
01:27:34,131 --> 01:27:36,900
- So you're like a family adviser.
- I'm a family friend.

1749
01:27:36,901 --> 01:27:39,602
Then you probably know that
Lisa's been seeing a therapist.

1750
01:27:39,603 --> 01:27:41,170
- Yeah.
- For many years.

1751
01:27:41,171 --> 01:27:43,474
- Yeah.
- Without my knowledge.

1752
01:27:44,909 --> 01:27:46,776
That really wasn't my business.

1753
01:27:46,777 --> 01:27:50,079
(chuckles) I'm fascinated by what
you think is and isn't your business.

1754
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:54,218
Lisa's been going to a
therapist and she likes it

1755
01:27:54,219 --> 01:27:57,855
and would love for you and
Chrisann to go with her.

1756
01:27:57,856 --> 01:28:02,493
And the reason you know that is because
you're the one that recommended the therapist.

1757
01:28:02,494 --> 01:28:04,561
Well, I know a guy.

1758
01:28:04,562 --> 01:28:08,466
No, I mean you're the one who
recommended that she see a therapist.

1759
01:28:09,634 --> 01:28:14,036
You know what? It was a while ago,
and I don't remember how the whole...

1760
01:28:14,037 --> 01:28:17,106
You told Chrisann that
Lisa should see a therapist.

1761
01:28:17,107 --> 01:28:20,244
Steve, you're stigmatizing.
It's a perfectly norm...

1762
01:28:20,245 --> 01:28:22,612
(sighs) It's not...

1763
01:28:22,613 --> 01:28:24,681
My thing was, how can it hurt?

1764
01:28:24,682 --> 01:28:26,651
Let's find out.

1765
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:29,151
Chrisann is my friend.

1766
01:28:29,152 --> 01:28:32,522
- What was the reason you gave?
- You mean...

1767
01:28:32,523 --> 01:28:36,660
What was the reason you gave Chrisann
why Lisa should see a therapist?

1768
01:28:36,661 --> 01:28:38,794
I don't remember. We
were talking and I said...

1769
01:28:38,795 --> 01:28:42,166
It's pretty much what I just said,
that it certainly couldn't hurt.

1770
01:28:43,634 --> 01:28:47,171
You didn't say that Lisa
needed a strong male role model?

1771
01:28:54,112 --> 01:28:55,680
I did.

1772
01:29:02,253 --> 01:29:07,659
I think it's a miracle she's not robbing
banks with the Symbionese Liberation Army.

1773
01:29:10,295 --> 01:29:15,331
There's no reason in the
world why she should be nice.

1774
01:29:15,332 --> 01:29:17,535
But she is.

1775
01:29:19,937 --> 01:29:24,641
So I helped, because somebody had to.

1776
01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:33,218
I'll wire the money to you this afternoon.

1777
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:48,130
You threatened me a long time ago.

1778
01:29:48,131 --> 01:29:49,800
Sorry?

1779
01:29:51,835 --> 01:29:54,937
A long time ago... You threatened me once.

1780
01:29:54,938 --> 01:29:57,007
People are attracted to people with talent.

1781
01:29:57,008 --> 01:29:59,209
People without it find that threatening.

1782
01:29:59,210 --> 01:30:01,277
- (snaps fingers)
- Maybe you should see a therapist.

1783
01:30:01,278 --> 01:30:03,879
Certainly couldn't hurt.

1784
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,216
I meant you literally threatened me.

1785
01:30:06,217 --> 01:30:08,752
At Flint, right before the Mac launch.

1786
01:30:08,753 --> 01:30:11,053
I was recompiling. I was
trying to debug the voice demo.

1787
01:30:11,054 --> 01:30:15,392
You said if I couldn't find a solution,
you'd call me out in front of the audience.

1788
01:30:15,393 --> 01:30:17,861
- Did it say "hello"?
- It did.

1789
01:30:17,862 --> 01:30:21,263
No need to thank me.

1790
01:30:21,264 --> 01:30:25,067
Why do you want people to dislike you?

1791
01:30:25,068 --> 01:30:28,237
I don't want people to dislike me.

1792
01:30:28,238 --> 01:30:31,342
I'm indifferent to whether they dislike me.

1793
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:35,847
Since it doesn't matter, I always have.

1794
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:39,084
Really?

1795
01:30:40,351 --> 01:30:44,656
I've always liked you
a lot. That's too bad.

1796
01:30:46,823 --> 01:30:49,693
- Knock 'em dead.
- Thank you.

1797
01:31:11,381 --> 01:31:16,152
What is remarkable, what's
hard to fathom but true,

1798
01:31:16,153 --> 01:31:22,494
is that for a given clock rate, a PowerPC
chip is twice as fast as a Pentium II chip.

1799
01:31:31,268 --> 01:31:33,504
(glasses clatter)

1800
01:31:35,372 --> 01:31:37,541
In other words,

1801
01:31:38,742 --> 01:31:41,277
a 266 megahertz G3 chip

1802
01:31:41,278 --> 01:31:46,817
is twice as fast as a
266 megahertz Pentium II.

1803
01:31:49,853 --> 01:31:54,124
Or... a 266 G3

1804
01:31:54,125 --> 01:31:58,227
is equal to about 500 megahertz.

1805
01:31:58,228 --> 01:32:01,330
STEVE'S VOICE: <i>Do you know
what a coincidence is, Lisa?</i>

1806
01:32:01,331 --> 01:32:03,999
Take a look at <i>Byte</i>
magazine's Byte Marks,

1807
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,670
- the gold standard for any...
- (knocking)

1808
01:32:11,209 --> 01:32:14,646
- Come in.
- (door opens)

1809
01:32:17,482 --> 01:32:20,182
I sent someone into the lobby.

1810
01:32:20,183 --> 01:32:22,017
- They found her, and she...
- Where is she?

1811
01:32:22,018 --> 01:32:24,887
She said she'd rather not come back.

1812
01:32:24,888 --> 01:32:27,257
- Why?
- That was it.

1813
01:32:27,258 --> 01:32:30,259
- I'm going out there myself.
- You can't. You can't.

1814
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:32,027
It'll be a scene out of
<i>Hard Day's Night.</i>

1815
01:32:32,028 --> 01:32:34,897
- (knocking)
- (door opens)

1816
01:32:34,898 --> 01:32:37,267
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Joel.

1817
01:32:37,268 --> 01:32:39,102
Andy said it was okay to come back.

1818
01:32:39,103 --> 01:32:41,739
- Which one?
- Andy Cunningham.

1819
01:32:42,839 --> 01:32:45,808
I can't do this forever. I need
one of them to change their name.

1820
01:32:45,809 --> 01:32:47,910
You call Andy Cunningham "Andrea."

1821
01:32:47,911 --> 01:32:49,311
It doesn't matter what I call them.

1822
01:32:49,312 --> 01:32:51,047
I know who I'm talking
about when I'm talking.

1823
01:32:51,048 --> 01:32:52,915
I need everyone else to
call them different names.

1824
01:32:52,916 --> 01:32:54,952
Give me one second.

1825
01:32:59,223 --> 01:33:01,792
Can you go get her for me, please?

1826
01:33:01,793 --> 01:33:03,459
I just talked to Andy.

1827
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:05,227
Hertzfeld.

1828
01:33:05,228 --> 01:33:08,464
I'm just trying to scrub this
out of my brain with Drano.

1829
01:33:08,465 --> 01:33:10,866
But I do want to talk to Lisa.

1830
01:33:10,867 --> 01:33:13,402
Okay. Just...

1831
01:33:13,403 --> 01:33:15,706
- Stay cool.
- Okay.

1832
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:19,744
Thank you.

1833
01:33:27,285 --> 01:33:29,019
Hey, Steve.

1834
01:33:41,464 --> 01:33:44,834
- How are you feeling?
- I'm feeling good, Joel. How about you?

1835
01:33:44,835 --> 01:33:47,503
I don't think I could be in your
business. It changes too quickly.

1836
01:33:47,504 --> 01:33:50,841
Well, I'd hang on, 'cause yours is about
to start changing pretty quickly too.

1837
01:33:50,842 --> 01:33:54,009
This is the third time in 14
years I'm writing about you.

1838
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:57,414
- What do you think so far?
- (knocking)

1839
01:33:57,415 --> 01:34:01,183
Excuse me. Avie's looking
for you. He has a new shark.

1840
01:34:01,184 --> 01:34:03,655
- You wanna come backstage for a second?
- JOEL: Sure.

1841
01:34:06,957 --> 01:34:10,160
- Who's this one?
- Alan Turing.

1842
01:34:10,161 --> 01:34:13,896
Single-handedly won World War II and,
for an encore, invented the computer.

1843
01:34:13,897 --> 01:34:16,098
- He won't be part of the campaign though.
- Why not?

1844
01:34:16,099 --> 01:34:18,535
'Cause you just had to ask me who he was.

1845
01:34:19,870 --> 01:34:21,838
Can I see new shark?

1846
01:34:24,375 --> 01:34:26,543
I like it better than the old shark.

1847
01:34:26,544 --> 01:34:28,178
- Sharks.
- Sharks.

1848
01:34:28,179 --> 01:34:30,079
- How many sharks did you go through?
- A couple.

1849
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:33,883
- This is the 39th.
- We're on the record.

1850
01:34:33,884 --> 01:34:36,553
- Thirty-nine sharks.
- Okay.

1851
01:34:36,554 --> 01:34:38,621
- You know what's special about this shark?
- What?

1852
01:34:38,622 --> 01:34:43,293
No, I'm really asking, because it looks
exactly like the other 38 sharks to me.

1853
01:34:43,294 --> 01:34:45,294
STEVE: Let me see it with
the cue, from the profile.

1854
01:34:45,295 --> 01:34:47,163
WOMAN: This is cue 92-B.

1855
01:34:47,164 --> 01:34:51,368
This is a profile here, and this
is what it looks like from the back.

1856
01:34:51,369 --> 01:34:56,172
And one more thing. It eats
Pentium notebooks as a light snack.

1857
01:34:56,173 --> 01:34:59,241
This is the shark.

1858
01:34:59,242 --> 01:35:01,511
I really like it.

1859
01:35:01,512 --> 01:35:03,312
Nobody gets it right the first time,

1860
01:35:03,313 --> 01:35:05,915
but I should have been shown
this shark 15, 20 fish ago.

1861
01:35:05,916 --> 01:35:07,616
- You probably were.
- Lock it in.

1862
01:35:07,617 --> 01:35:09,451
Ten minutes.

1863
01:35:09,452 --> 01:35:13,956
He killed himself by taking a bite
of a poison apple... Alan Turing.

1864
01:35:13,957 --> 01:35:15,091
Yeah.

1865
01:35:15,092 --> 01:35:17,694
There should be statues of that man.

1866
01:35:17,695 --> 01:35:20,062
His name should be on the
lips of schoolchildren.

1867
01:35:20,063 --> 01:35:23,633
The rainbow flag apple with a bite
taken out... That's where it came from?

1868
01:35:23,634 --> 01:35:26,503
No, we picked it off a list
of friendly-sounding words.

1869
01:35:26,504 --> 01:35:29,472
But wouldn't it be great if that
had been the story behind it?

1870
01:35:29,473 --> 01:35:33,075
Steve. Kinda liked the last shark.

1871
01:35:33,076 --> 01:35:35,011
- AVIE: Fuck you.
- (chuckles)

1872
01:35:35,012 --> 01:35:36,612
I wanted to ask you a favor.

1873
01:35:36,613 --> 01:35:37,813
My friend, a long time ago,

1874
01:35:37,814 --> 01:35:40,583
you asked me a favor before a
product launch, and I said no.

1875
01:35:40,584 --> 01:35:43,018
- You wanted me to acknowledge...
- Hang on.

1876
01:35:43,019 --> 01:35:47,289
If you're about to say you were wrong,
I want to prepare this journalist.

1877
01:35:47,290 --> 01:35:51,628
I was 100% right, and you
were spectacularly wrong.

1878
01:35:51,629 --> 01:35:54,129
But I still owe you a favor, so name it.

1879
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:55,697
(sighs) Steve...

1880
01:35:55,698 --> 01:36:00,369
- It can't be acknowledging the Apple II team.
- Acknowledge the Apple II team.

1881
01:36:00,370 --> 01:36:02,172
- How about in private?
- No.

1882
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:03,606
- Is this a prank?
- No.

1883
01:36:03,607 --> 01:36:05,741
I'm trying to remember that
a 300 megahertz G3 chip...

1884
01:36:05,742 --> 01:36:08,012
Just the top guys.

1885
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:12,082
Steve.

1886
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:16,686
- Excuse me, okay?
- Yep.

1887
01:36:16,687 --> 01:36:19,188
One second.

1888
01:36:19,189 --> 01:36:21,691
(clears throat)

1889
01:36:21,692 --> 01:36:26,096
- She said she'd rather not.
- What do you mean?

1890
01:36:26,097 --> 01:36:29,432
She's sitting with her friends, and
she said she'd rather not come back.

1891
01:36:29,433 --> 01:36:31,433
Okay. Tell her... Take her aside.

1892
01:36:31,434 --> 01:36:33,436
I don't want to embarrass
her in front of her friends.

1893
01:36:33,437 --> 01:36:35,672
But tell her I just scared
the shit out of Andy,

1894
01:36:35,673 --> 01:36:38,209
and this time, nobody's
paying her fucking...

1895
01:36:39,477 --> 01:36:41,544
All right. Don't say that.

1896
01:36:41,545 --> 01:36:44,146
But do your thing where
you sound old and wise

1897
01:36:44,147 --> 01:36:47,417
because of the broad, tragic
European canvas of your life.

1898
01:36:47,418 --> 01:36:50,285
You know I wasn't born in a
19th-century shtetl, right?

1899
01:36:50,286 --> 01:36:52,454
Please tell her it's important.

1900
01:36:52,455 --> 01:36:55,025
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

1901
01:36:55,026 --> 01:36:56,625
- There are people around here, man...
- I know.

1902
01:36:56,626 --> 01:37:00,562
- Including a member of the press.
- I see him.

1903
01:37:00,563 --> 01:37:01,664
Woz.

1904
01:37:01,665 --> 01:37:04,936
Just the top guys, the ones
who are getting laid off.

1905
01:37:06,137 --> 01:37:08,405
(clears throat) Listen, okay?

1906
01:37:08,406 --> 01:37:13,343
Last year, Apple lost one billion dollars.

1907
01:37:13,344 --> 01:37:15,311
I don't even know how that's possible.

1908
01:37:15,312 --> 01:37:17,780
You were less than 90
days from being insolvent.

1909
01:37:17,781 --> 01:37:20,583
I had three different accountants
try to explain it to me.

1910
01:37:20,584 --> 01:37:23,585
The whole place has to be streamlined.

1911
01:37:23,586 --> 01:37:26,188
- Start with two of the accountants.
- I started with the...

1912
01:37:26,189 --> 01:37:29,225
- Joel, could you come offstage? We're gonna go backstage.
- Leave him right there.

1913
01:37:29,226 --> 01:37:33,596
I started with the Apple II team
because we don't make that anymore.

1914
01:37:33,597 --> 01:37:37,333
- Just acknowledge the top guys.
- Have a mimosa and relax.

1915
01:37:37,334 --> 01:37:39,835
You will not blow me off right now, Steve.

1916
01:37:39,836 --> 01:37:42,605
- The top guys deserve...
- There are no top guys.

1917
01:37:42,606 --> 01:37:45,208
All right? On the Apple II
team, there are no top guys.

1918
01:37:45,209 --> 01:37:48,645
They're "B" players, and "B"
players discourage the "A" players.

1919
01:37:48,646 --> 01:37:50,612
I want "A" players at Apple and not Dell.

1920
01:37:50,613 --> 01:37:53,348
They're not "B" players, and
I'm a better judge of that.

1921
01:37:53,349 --> 01:37:55,819
Less than 90 days from insolvency,

1922
01:37:55,820 --> 01:37:59,588
in part because somebody thought
the Newton wasn't a box of garbage.

1923
01:37:59,589 --> 01:38:01,223
- Joel, could you come offstage, please?
- Leave him.

1924
01:38:01,224 --> 01:38:02,659
I'm talking about...

1925
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:05,261
You guys designed and shipped a
little box of garbage while I was gone.

1926
01:38:05,262 --> 01:38:06,728
I'm talking about the Apple II,

1927
01:38:06,729 --> 01:38:09,531
which is not just a crucial
part of this company's history,

1928
01:38:09,532 --> 01:38:12,102
it is a crucial part of the
history of personal computing.

1929
01:38:12,103 --> 01:38:13,770
For a time.

1930
01:38:13,771 --> 01:38:16,371
The least you can do, if you're
going to downsize these people...

1931
01:38:16,372 --> 01:38:19,174
They're gonna live in the biggest houses
of anyone on the unemployment line.

1932
01:38:19,175 --> 01:38:23,480
Is to acknowledge them. Acknowledge
them and the Apple II during this launch.

1933
01:38:23,481 --> 01:38:25,048
This is a new animal.

1934
01:38:25,049 --> 01:38:29,185
This whole place was built by the Apple
II. <i>You</i> were built by the Apple II.

1935
01:38:29,186 --> 01:38:32,254
As a matter of fact, I was destroyed
by the Apple II and its open system

1936
01:38:32,255 --> 01:38:34,124
so that hackers and hobbyists

1937
01:38:34,125 --> 01:38:37,593
could build ham radios or something.

1938
01:38:37,594 --> 01:38:39,395
And then it nearly destroyed Apple

1939
01:38:39,396 --> 01:38:41,431
when you spent all your money on it

1940
01:38:41,432 --> 01:38:44,700
and developed a grand
total of no new products.

1941
01:38:44,701 --> 01:38:46,669
- The Newton.
- The little box of garbage.

1942
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:50,775
You guys came up with the Newton.
You want people to know that?

1943
01:38:52,675 --> 01:38:56,146
This is a product launch, not a luncheon.

1944
01:38:56,147 --> 01:38:58,248
The last thing I want to
do is connect the iMac to...

1945
01:38:58,249 --> 01:39:01,217
WOZNIAK: To the only successful
product that this company has ever made.

1946
01:39:01,218 --> 01:39:04,654
I'm sorry to be blunt, but
that happens to be the truth.

1947
01:39:04,655 --> 01:39:08,624
The Lisa was a failure.
The Macintosh was a failure.

1948
01:39:08,625 --> 01:39:10,692
I don't like talking like this,

1949
01:39:10,693 --> 01:39:15,431
but I am tired of being
Ringo when I know I was John.

1950
01:39:15,432 --> 01:39:16,833
Everybody loves Ringo.

1951
01:39:16,834 --> 01:39:19,903
And I'm tired of being patronized by you.

1952
01:39:21,705 --> 01:39:24,339
You think John became John
by winning a raffle, Woz?

1953
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:25,708
You think he tricked somebody

1954
01:39:25,709 --> 01:39:28,311
or hit George Harrison over the head?

1955
01:39:28,312 --> 01:39:30,245
He was John because he was John.

1956
01:39:30,246 --> 01:39:34,584
He was John 'cause he wrote "Ticket
to Ride." And I wrote the Apple II.

1957
01:39:34,585 --> 01:39:38,122
- Everybody? I want to clear the auditorium.
- Nobody moves.

1958
01:39:40,456 --> 01:39:42,292
You made a beautiful board,

1959
01:39:42,293 --> 01:39:44,427
which, by the way, you were
willing to give out for free,

1960
01:39:44,428 --> 01:39:46,495
so don't tell me how you built Apple.

1961
01:39:46,496 --> 01:39:48,897
If it weren't for me, you'd be the
easiest "A" at Homestead High School.

1962
01:39:48,898 --> 01:39:53,203
These people live and die by your
praise, so here's your chance.

1963
01:39:53,204 --> 01:39:58,241
Acknowledge that something good happened
that you weren't in the room for.

1964
01:40:01,378 --> 01:40:03,612
- No.
- Steve.

1965
01:40:03,613 --> 01:40:08,184
Do it. It's right. It's...

1966
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:11,353
It's right.

1967
01:40:11,354 --> 01:40:13,489
Sorry, but no.

1968
01:40:13,490 --> 01:40:16,892
Then let me put it another way.

1969
01:40:16,893 --> 01:40:19,795
I don't think there's a man
who's done more to advance

1970
01:40:19,796 --> 01:40:23,333
the democratization that comes
with personal computing than I have,

1971
01:40:23,334 --> 01:40:24,901
but you've never had any respect for me.

1972
01:40:24,902 --> 01:40:27,004
Now why is that?

1973
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:29,638
I'd at least consider the possibility

1974
01:40:29,639 --> 01:40:31,673
that it's because you've
never had any for me.

1975
01:40:31,674 --> 01:40:33,977
(door opens)

1976
01:40:33,978 --> 01:40:35,712
What the hell is going on here?

1977
01:40:35,713 --> 01:40:39,183
Nothing. Thank you for your time.

1978
01:40:42,686 --> 01:40:45,788
It's done. She's coming back.

1979
01:40:45,789 --> 01:40:48,358
You came a half-inch from putting
this company out of business.

1980
01:40:49,927 --> 01:40:52,162
Now who do I see about that?

1981
01:40:53,296 --> 01:40:55,498
I'm letting you keep your job.

1982
01:40:55,499 --> 01:40:57,902
You get a pass.

1983
01:41:00,403 --> 01:41:01,803
You know, when people used to ask me

1984
01:41:01,804 --> 01:41:04,374
what the difference was
between me and Steve Jobs,

1985
01:41:04,375 --> 01:41:07,477
I would say Steve was the big-picture guy

1986
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:09,411
and I liked a solid workbench.

1987
01:41:09,412 --> 01:41:11,414
When people ask me what
the difference is now,

1988
01:41:11,415 --> 01:41:13,850
I say "Steve's an asshole."

1989
01:41:13,851 --> 01:41:16,652
Your products are better
than you are, brother.

1990
01:41:16,653 --> 01:41:19,621
That's the idea, brother.

1991
01:41:19,622 --> 01:41:23,459
And knowing that, that's the difference.

1992
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:26,462
It's not binary.

1993
01:41:26,463 --> 01:41:30,034
You can be decent and
gifted at the same time.

1994
01:41:51,722 --> 01:41:53,856
JOANNA: He didn't mean it.

1995
01:41:53,857 --> 01:41:55,960
Yeah, he did.

1996
01:41:58,429 --> 01:42:00,397
He's a temperamental guy.

1997
01:42:01,598 --> 01:42:03,300
No, he's not.

1998
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:10,505
(scoffs) It's like five
minutes before every launch,

1999
01:42:10,506 --> 01:42:14,677
everyone goes to a bar, gets drunk
and tells me what they really think.

2000
01:42:14,678 --> 01:42:17,414
- (sighs)
- She's coming to your dressing room.

2001
01:42:28,025 --> 01:42:30,426
JOANNA: I told you to make
things all right with Lisa.

2002
01:42:30,427 --> 01:42:33,730
I didn't say you had to settle
every blood feud you have.

2003
01:42:33,731 --> 01:42:37,767
STEVE: Last time blood feuds weren't
settled, I lost the cover of <i>Time.</i>

2004
01:42:37,768 --> 01:42:41,471
Though for the life of me, I still don't know
what the hell Dan Kottke was mad at me about.

2005
01:42:41,472 --> 01:42:44,139
- Kottke didn't lose you the cover of <i>Time.</i>
- Of course he did.

2006
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:46,776
Would you like me to demonstrate
your capacity to be wrong

2007
01:42:46,777 --> 01:42:48,378
when you're certain you're right?

2008
01:42:48,379 --> 01:42:50,847
Dan Kottke told <i>Time</i>
magazine that I was denying...

2009
01:42:50,848 --> 01:42:52,615
Do you remember the cover?

2010
01:42:52,616 --> 01:42:54,150
- Of <i>Time?</i>
- Yes.

2011
01:42:54,151 --> 01:42:55,918
- Yes.
- What was it?

2012
01:42:55,919 --> 01:42:57,986
- What are you talking about?
- What was on the cover?

2013
01:42:57,987 --> 01:42:59,588
- A computer.
- No.

2014
01:42:59,589 --> 01:43:01,990
It was a sculpture of a computer.

2015
01:43:01,991 --> 01:43:04,561
It was a sculpture.

2016
01:43:05,696 --> 01:43:08,865
<i>Time</i> would have had to have
commissioned it months in advance.

2017
01:43:08,866 --> 01:43:11,066
You were never in the
conversation for Man of the Year.

2018
01:43:11,067 --> 01:43:12,768
Nobody lost you anything.

2019
01:43:12,769 --> 01:43:14,637
STEVE'S VOICE: <i>...picture
of me and the Mac.</i>

2020
01:43:14,638 --> 01:43:17,673
So what else are you sure about?

2021
01:43:17,674 --> 01:43:20,575
I don't know how I could've missed that.

2022
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:22,611
- Reality distortion.
- No, seriously.

2023
01:43:22,612 --> 01:43:23,812
Seriously.

2024
01:43:23,813 --> 01:43:26,615
Don't try to win an argument with Lisa.

2025
01:43:26,616 --> 01:43:29,752
- Just say you were wrong.
- (knocking)

2026
01:43:29,753 --> 01:43:31,856
Come on in, honey.

2027
01:43:32,889 --> 01:43:35,424
- It's not "honey."
- John.

2028
01:43:35,425 --> 01:43:37,627
Get in. Get in. Get out of the hall.

2029
01:43:37,628 --> 01:43:39,061
I was taken in a side entrance.

2030
01:43:39,062 --> 01:43:40,963
I'll go out the same
way. No one will see me.

2031
01:43:40,964 --> 01:43:43,566
- How are you, Joanna?
- I'm good, John.

2032
01:43:43,567 --> 01:43:46,102
I'm just surprised to see you.

2033
01:43:46,103 --> 01:43:48,704
Everyone here really appreciates
the quote you gave to <i>Forbes.</i>

2034
01:43:48,705 --> 01:43:51,507
- You didn't have to do that.
- My pleasure.

2035
01:43:51,508 --> 01:43:54,544
JOANNA: If you want, I can slip you in
the back once the house lights go out.

2036
01:43:54,545 --> 01:43:57,548
- JOHN: I'm just here to say "good luck."
- <i>Okay.</i>

2037
01:43:58,915 --> 01:44:00,917
You just have a couple of minutes.

2038
01:44:00,918 --> 01:44:03,254
- Would you try to find...
- Yeah.

2039
01:44:07,457 --> 01:44:09,559
You're a good man, John.

2040
01:44:11,128 --> 01:44:13,530
(door opens)

2041
01:44:15,566 --> 01:44:17,501
(door closes)

2042
01:44:21,905 --> 01:44:25,040
So I brought you a present.

2043
01:44:25,041 --> 01:44:26,709
STEVE: A Newton.

2044
01:44:26,710 --> 01:44:32,514
Don't take it out of the box, you'll be able
to sell it, which is more than I can say.

2045
01:44:32,515 --> 01:44:34,484
Everything all right there?

2046
01:44:34,485 --> 01:44:36,752
Uh, no... (clears throat)

2047
01:44:36,753 --> 01:44:39,754
Just something Joanna pointed out to me.

2048
01:44:39,755 --> 01:44:43,025
I missed something so obvious about...

2049
01:44:43,026 --> 01:44:44,628
Doesn't matter.

2050
01:44:46,629 --> 01:44:50,098
Look, Wall Street's gonna sit back
and wait to see how you do as CEO,

2051
01:44:50,099 --> 01:44:52,968
so don't let any fluctuation
bother you for the first 12 months.

2052
01:44:52,969 --> 01:44:55,472
Day traders are gonna respond.

2053
01:44:56,506 --> 01:44:58,409
I don't need to school you.

2054
01:44:59,643 --> 01:45:01,843
This your way of telling me I
shouldn't have killed the Newton?

2055
01:45:01,844 --> 01:45:06,281
The most efficient animal
on the planet is the condor.

2056
01:45:06,282 --> 01:45:09,084
The most inefficient animals
on the planet are humans.

2057
01:45:09,085 --> 01:45:11,853
(chuckles) Well, you shouldn't
have killed it for spite.

2058
01:45:11,854 --> 01:45:15,290
That's bad business. Don't do that.

2059
01:45:15,291 --> 01:45:20,663
But a human with a bicycle
becomes the most efficient animal.

2060
01:45:20,664 --> 01:45:22,798
And the right computer...

2061
01:45:22,799 --> 01:45:25,601
a friendly, easy computer
that isn't an eyesore

2062
01:45:25,602 --> 01:45:30,071
but rather sits on your desk with
the beauty of a Tensor lamp...

2063
01:45:30,072 --> 01:45:35,076
The right computer will
be a bicycle for the mind.

2064
01:45:35,077 --> 01:45:37,679
Do you like it?

2065
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:40,081
I was giving back.

2066
01:45:40,082 --> 01:45:44,219
And what if instead of it
being in the right hands,

2067
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:46,289
it was in everyone's hands?

2068
01:45:46,290 --> 01:45:48,392
Everyone in the world.

2069
01:45:49,893 --> 01:45:52,962
JOHN: We'd be talking about the most
tectonic shift in the status quo since...

2070
01:45:52,963 --> 01:45:54,364
Ever.

2071
01:45:54,365 --> 01:45:57,566
I don't know why you've always been
interested in my adoption history,

2072
01:45:57,567 --> 01:46:01,603
but you said it's not like someone
looked at me and gave me back.

2073
01:46:01,604 --> 01:46:03,039
But that is what happened.

2074
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:05,576
And you're telling me you
have the right computer.

2075
01:46:06,677 --> 01:46:08,977
It's called Macintosh.

2076
01:46:08,978 --> 01:46:11,713
A lawyer couple adopted me first,

2077
01:46:11,714 --> 01:46:14,216
then gave me back after a month.

2078
01:46:14,217 --> 01:46:16,387
They changed their mind.

2079
01:46:17,987 --> 01:46:20,690
Then my parents adopted me.

2080
01:46:20,691 --> 01:46:23,258
My biological mother had
stipulated that whoever took me

2081
01:46:23,259 --> 01:46:26,795
had to be college-educated,
wealthy and Catholic.

2082
01:46:26,796 --> 01:46:29,331
Paul and Clara Jobs were
none of those things,

2083
01:46:29,332 --> 01:46:33,768
so my biological mother wouldn't
sign the adoption papers.

2084
01:46:33,769 --> 01:46:35,070
What happened?

2085
01:46:35,071 --> 01:46:38,607
There was a legal battle
that went on for a while.

2086
01:46:38,608 --> 01:46:41,877
My mother said she refused
to love me for the first year.

2087
01:46:41,878 --> 01:46:43,812
You know, in case they had to give me back.

2088
01:46:43,813 --> 01:46:46,816
You can't refuse to love someone, Steve.

2089
01:46:46,817 --> 01:46:49,685
Yeah, it turns out you can.

2090
01:46:49,686 --> 01:46:53,822
What the hell can a one-month-old do
that's so bad his parents give him back?

2091
01:46:53,823 --> 01:46:56,758
Nothing. There's nothing
a one-month-old can do...

2092
01:46:56,759 --> 01:47:00,029
Have you ever thought about trying
to find your biological father?

2093
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:01,731
I've met my biological father.

2094
01:47:01,732 --> 01:47:03,600
For that matter, so have you.

2095
01:47:06,236 --> 01:47:08,070
It's called Macintosh.

2096
01:47:08,071 --> 01:47:10,740
- Mr. Steve Jobs.
- Jandali.

2097
01:47:10,741 --> 01:47:12,208
Say hello to John Sculley.

2098
01:47:12,209 --> 01:47:15,777
Jandali owns the place,
and John's the CEO of Pepsi,

2099
01:47:15,778 --> 01:47:19,382
<i>but I'm trying to get him to move to
Cupertino, put a dent in the universe.</i>

2100
01:47:19,383 --> 01:47:21,182
You eat vegan as well?

2101
01:47:21,183 --> 01:47:22,785
You're kidding me.

2102
01:47:22,786 --> 01:47:24,387
No, I'll eat anything.

2103
01:47:24,388 --> 01:47:28,356
Why don't you start off with the Mediterranean
lettuce salad with purslane, mint...

2104
01:47:28,357 --> 01:47:32,261
My sister found him.

2105
01:47:32,262 --> 01:47:34,664
- Does he know?
- No. In fact, he bragged to Mona

2106
01:47:34,665 --> 01:47:36,999
that Steve Jobs comes in
the restaurant all the time.

2107
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,935
- You don't want to...
- No.

2108
01:47:39,936 --> 01:47:42,840
JOHN: <i>Don't you think
you should talk to him?</i>

2109
01:47:44,206 --> 01:47:47,209
He'd probably find a reason to sue me.

2110
01:47:47,210 --> 01:47:49,712
Oh, Steve...

2111
01:47:49,713 --> 01:47:52,815
John, if you're here about your legacy,

2112
01:47:52,816 --> 01:47:54,450
you need to form a line behind Wozniak.

2113
01:47:54,451 --> 01:47:56,718
(sighs) Wozniak's gonna be fine.

2114
01:47:56,719 --> 01:47:59,922
I'm the guy who fired Steve Jobs.

2115
01:47:59,923 --> 01:48:03,058
Rich, college-educated and Catholic.

2116
01:48:03,059 --> 01:48:07,330
- (knocks)
- Steve? It's time.

2117
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:13,570
(smacks lips) I've gotta go.

2118
01:48:15,772 --> 01:48:19,376
Did I do this? Screw it up?

2119
01:48:22,245 --> 01:48:24,381
Let's let it go now.

2120
01:48:25,848 --> 01:48:27,750
Has to be time.

2121
01:48:32,222 --> 01:48:34,758
Come be our CEO.

2122
01:48:35,991 --> 01:48:37,894
Yeah. Okay.

2123
01:48:38,929 --> 01:48:42,366
(both laughing)

2124
01:48:46,335 --> 01:48:49,871
- (snaps fingers)
- It was the stylus, John.

2125
01:48:49,872 --> 01:48:53,942
- What?
- I killed the Newton because of the stylus.

2126
01:48:53,943 --> 01:48:57,781
If you're holding a stylus, you can't use the
other five that are attached to your wrist.

2127
01:49:01,284 --> 01:49:03,487
Things we could have done together.

2128
01:49:08,825 --> 01:49:11,394
God, the things we could've done.

2129
01:49:27,777 --> 01:49:29,244
I'm paying your tuition.

2130
01:49:29,245 --> 01:49:31,446
Are you crazy? Of course
I'm paying your tuition.

2131
01:49:31,447 --> 01:49:34,984
I must have misunderstood you when
you said you weren't paying my tuition.

2132
01:49:34,985 --> 01:49:37,453
You and your mom selling the
house was a hostile thing to do.

2133
01:49:37,454 --> 01:49:39,254
She needed the money.

2134
01:49:39,255 --> 01:49:41,056
She always needs the money.

2135
01:49:41,057 --> 01:49:45,127
She needs a doctor. She
has a sinus infection.

2136
01:49:45,128 --> 01:49:48,998
She's had the same sinus
infection since 1988.

2137
01:49:48,999 --> 01:49:52,200
I'm gonna take care of my mother.
I'm sorry if that angers you.

2138
01:49:52,201 --> 01:49:54,069
It does anger me, because you're a kid

2139
01:49:54,070 --> 01:49:56,405
and it's not your job to
take care of your mother.

2140
01:49:56,406 --> 01:49:58,440
Is that how yours died?

2141
01:49:58,441 --> 01:50:02,477
Guys, step away, please,
and give them some room.

2142
01:50:02,478 --> 01:50:05,481
When your mom is 90 and can't feed herself,

2143
01:50:05,482 --> 01:50:06,816
you can take care of her.

2144
01:50:06,817 --> 01:50:12,320
But right now, she's 45, perfectly
healthy and can't feed herself.

2145
01:50:12,321 --> 01:50:15,524
You're supposed to work hard at
school and be 19, and that's it.

2146
01:50:15,525 --> 01:50:18,494
- I'll take care of your mother.
- Keep up the good work.

2147
01:50:18,495 --> 01:50:21,096
- What the hell do you want from me?
- I was sent for.

2148
01:50:21,097 --> 01:50:23,833
I bought her a house for $400,000.

2149
01:50:23,834 --> 01:50:25,567
It's worth twice that much today.

2150
01:50:25,568 --> 01:50:28,036
She sold it for two magic
rocks and a bowl of soup.

2151
01:50:28,037 --> 01:50:29,471
It was her house.

2152
01:50:29,472 --> 01:50:31,272
She used that money to
travel through Europe.

2153
01:50:31,273 --> 01:50:33,107
Money which you make her beg for.

2154
01:50:33,108 --> 01:50:35,244
- Steve...
- Don't even start with that.

2155
01:50:35,245 --> 01:50:37,279
Going to Andy and asking for the money?

2156
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:39,114
That was so off-the-charts
over the line...

2157
01:50:39,115 --> 01:50:42,383
I did not do that. Andy came to me.

2158
01:50:42,384 --> 01:50:45,420
Everybody have an opinion on this?

2159
01:50:45,421 --> 01:50:48,958
I'm sorry, guys. In 30 seconds,
you're going to be late.

2160
01:50:48,959 --> 01:50:52,861
She spends the money on antiques and then
sells them for a fraction of what she paid,

2161
01:50:52,862 --> 01:50:55,063
and she does it with money
I gave to her for you.

2162
01:50:55,064 --> 01:50:56,464
Steve...

2163
01:50:56,465 --> 01:50:58,366
You came to me hysterical when you were 13,

2164
01:50:58,367 --> 01:51:00,268
- asking if you could live with me...
- I was not hysterical.

2165
01:51:00,269 --> 01:51:02,003
Because your mom was
screaming at you every day.

2166
01:51:02,004 --> 01:51:04,138
Thirteen was the second time I asked you.

2167
01:51:04,139 --> 01:51:05,874
The stress of her life
as a spiritual healer.

2168
01:51:05,875 --> 01:51:10,012
I don't believe I said you're a
bad guy. But if I did, I'm sorry.

2169
01:51:13,148 --> 01:51:15,618
Hey. Something happened to you at school,

2170
01:51:15,619 --> 01:51:21,022
some first semester core class that
all freshmen are required to take...

2171
01:51:21,023 --> 01:51:23,892
- I read <i>Time.</i>
- What?

2172
01:51:23,893 --> 01:51:27,495
I have Internet access at school.
I read an old copy of <i>Time,</i>

2173
01:51:27,496 --> 01:51:31,299
and I asked my mom some
questions about my family history.

2174
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:33,067
That was...

2175
01:51:33,068 --> 01:51:35,169
<i>Time</i> wrote a
mangled piece of journal.

2176
01:51:35,170 --> 01:51:36,571
You were never supposed to read that.

2177
01:51:36,572 --> 01:51:39,074
I had two different Harvard statisticians

2178
01:51:39,075 --> 01:51:41,677
try to reverse-engineer the
equation that you came up with

2179
01:51:41,678 --> 01:51:45,446
to prove that 28% of American
men could be my father.

2180
01:51:45,447 --> 01:51:46,848
Honey, I...

2181
01:51:46,849 --> 01:51:50,652
You know, my mother might be a
troubled woman, but what's your excuse?

2182
01:51:50,653 --> 01:51:54,255
That's why I'm not impressed
with your story, Dad.

2183
01:51:54,256 --> 01:51:56,325
It's that you knew what
I was going through,

2184
01:51:56,326 --> 01:51:58,294
and you didn't do anything about it,

2185
01:51:58,295 --> 01:52:02,032
and that makes you an
unconscionable coward.

2186
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:05,935
And not for nothing, but
"think" is a verb, all right,

2187
01:52:05,936 --> 01:52:07,335
making "different" an adverb.

2188
01:52:07,336 --> 01:52:09,304
You're asking people to think differently.

2189
01:52:09,305 --> 01:52:11,106
And you can talk about the Bauhaus movement

2190
01:52:11,107 --> 01:52:13,107
and Braun and "Simplicity
is sophistication"

2191
01:52:13,108 --> 01:52:16,445
and Issey Miyake uniforms and
Bob Dylan lyrics all you want,

2192
01:52:16,446 --> 01:52:21,151
but that thing looks like
Judy Jetson's Easy-Bake oven.

2193
01:52:26,055 --> 01:52:28,524
(exhales)

2194
01:52:28,525 --> 01:52:31,928
(applause)

2195
01:52:40,370 --> 01:52:41,536
Hey.

2196
01:52:41,537 --> 01:52:44,138
(stammers) You're gonna start late.

2197
01:52:44,139 --> 01:52:46,342
- You know what Lisa stood for?
- What?

2198
01:52:46,343 --> 01:52:48,544
The computer. The Lisa.
You know what it stood for?

2199
01:52:48,545 --> 01:52:51,679
I'm sorry I said that about the
iMac. It's not what I really think.

2200
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:55,683
Behind my back, at the office,
you know what it stood for?

2201
01:52:55,684 --> 01:52:59,253
Local Integrated System
Architecture. I was five.

2202
01:52:59,254 --> 01:53:01,957
- Why couldn't you just lie?
- I did.

2203
01:53:02,992 --> 01:53:05,227
Of course it was named after you.

2204
01:53:05,228 --> 01:53:10,132
Local Integrated System Architecture
doesn't even mean anything.

2205
01:53:10,133 --> 01:53:13,068
Why'd you say it wasn't all those years?

2206
01:53:15,071 --> 01:53:16,973
I honestly don't know.

2207
01:53:19,275 --> 01:53:21,745
Why'd you say you weren't my father?

2208
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:27,150
I'm poorly made.

2209
01:53:34,656 --> 01:53:38,194
- It's after 9:00. You're gonna be late.
- I don't care.

2210
01:53:43,366 --> 01:53:45,467
- You're writing for the <i>Crimson.</i>
- What?

2211
01:53:45,468 --> 01:53:47,535
The Apple chapter of the
Harvard Alumni Association

2212
01:53:47,536 --> 01:53:49,370
tells me you're writing
for the <i>Crimson.</i>

2213
01:53:49,371 --> 01:53:53,042
Oh. Yeah, a little bit. Essays.

2214
01:53:53,043 --> 01:53:55,811
- I'd like to read one.
- Sure.

2215
01:53:55,812 --> 01:53:58,280
No, I mean now. I'd like to
read one of your essays now.

2216
01:53:58,281 --> 01:54:00,717
Come on. You've got to go on stage.

2217
01:54:02,317 --> 01:54:05,320
The iMac will not be launched until
you give me one of your essays,

2218
01:54:05,321 --> 01:54:08,992
so the world is waiting for you.

2219
01:54:15,598 --> 01:54:18,633
JOANNA: I'm really sorry, guys.

2220
01:54:18,634 --> 01:54:20,202
Good luck.

2221
01:54:33,148 --> 01:54:34,716
I'm gonna put music in your pocket.

2222
01:54:34,717 --> 01:54:36,820
What?

2223
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:42,790
Hundred songs. A thousand songs. 500 songs.

2224
01:54:42,791 --> 01:54:47,161
Somewhere between 500 and a
thousand songs right in your pocket,

2225
01:54:47,162 --> 01:54:50,499
'cause I can't stand looking at
that inexplicable Walkman anymore.

2226
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:52,767
You're carrying around a
brick playing cassette tape.

2227
01:54:52,768 --> 01:54:54,636
We're not savages.

2228
01:54:54,637 --> 01:54:57,806
So I'm gonna put a thousand
songs in your pocket.

2229
01:54:57,807 --> 01:55:00,441
- You can do that?
- Mm-hmm.

2230
01:55:00,442 --> 01:55:03,544
(man) <i>♪ We'd get
soaked right through ♪</i>

2231
01:55:03,545 --> 01:55:09,418
<i>♪ We used to tell them
