2
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,251
Claire.

3
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,850
I miss you.

4
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,255
Dr. Weir report te the Lewis & Clark
in Docking Bay 4.

5
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,400
- Ion drive set.
- Thank you.

6
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:06,073
Heading: Vector One, nine degrees.

7
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,081
We are prepped for lockdown.

8
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,295
I can't believe it, this is ridiculous.

9
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,300
I haven't got more than my hand
in the last six weeks, and now this shit.

10
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,511
I mean,
why can't we go to Mars, Captain?

11
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:32,015
- I mean, Mars has got women.
- Smith's right.

12
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,767
Neptune, there's nothing out there.

13
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,103
Yeah, and if the shit goes down,
we'll be on our own.

14
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,896
You know the rules, people.

15
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,025
Someone drops the ball, we get the call.
Now, let's go.

16
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,236
- Have you got our course plotted in?
- Yes, sir.

17
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,364
- Locked and cocked and ready to rock.
- Mr. Justin?

18
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,075
Everything's green on my screen,
Skipper.

19
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,326
Start your countdown now.

20
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,496
Ion drive will engage
in T minus 10 minutes.

21
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,289
Thank you, Lieutenant.

22
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,541
Let's go.

23
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,460
- Smith, you follow me.
- Yes, ma'am.

24
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,588
- Justin, get those tanks prepped.
- Yes, sir.

25
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,219
- Mr. Cooper.
- Skipper.

26
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,639
- Ion drive in 10 minutes.
- It's time to play spam-in-the-can.

27
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,308
- Skipper.
- Peters.

28
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,186
Captain Miller,
I just wanted to say this is something...

29
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,397
Clock is ticking, Doctor.

30
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,484
You waiting for a personal invitation,
there, Mr. Smith?

31
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,236
- No, sir.
- Captain, I don't want to take up...

32
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,114
Doctor, if you'll just follow
the rest of the crew to the grav tanks,

33
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,449
we're almost underway.

34
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,451
That bunk better be squared away,
Mr. Cooper,

35
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,244
or you'll find yourself walking
to Neptune.

36
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,620
What's the hold-up, Peters?

37
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,623
Just loading
the last of the CO2 scrubbers, sir.

38
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,667
You stand right here.

39
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,754
Thanks, D.J.

40
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,506
- Hats off in the tank.
- Sir.

41
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,259
- First time in a grav couch?
- Yeah.

42
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,473
I think your captain
has some kind of a problem with me.

43
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,766
Oh, well. Don't worry about him.

44
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,269
He just loves having complete strangers
on his ship.

45
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,229
- D.J.
- Yeah.

46
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,816
No.

47
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,818
Is this necessary?

48
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,822
When the ion drive fires,
you'll be taking about 30 G's.

49
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:15,160
Without a tank,
the force would liquety your skeleton.

50
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,080
I've seen the effect on mice.

51
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,294
Claustrophobic?

52
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,046
Very.

53
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,155
Biiiy.

54
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,951
I'm so aione.

55
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,122
Hello?

56
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,966
Is anyone there?

57
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,852
Oh, God.

58
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,012
Biiiy?

59
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,223
I'm so coid.

60
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,443
Claire.

61
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,031
I'm waiting.

62
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,296
You're all right. Breathe. D.J.!

63
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,341
- Okay, Dr. Weir, let's get you up.
- Okay, I'm fine.

64
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,676
- Come on, take it easy.
- I'm fine.

65
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,428
Okay. There you go.

66
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:24,683
Now move nice and slow.
You've been in stasis for 56 days.

67
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,477
You're gonna experience
a little disorientation, you understand?

68
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:31,314
- I'm all right now, thank you.
- Okay, take that. Don't rush it.

69
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,274
All yours.

70
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,780
You okay, Doc?

71
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,450
- Want some coffee?
- What?

72
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,995
Would you like some coffee?

73
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,499
No. Thank you.

74
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,502
All right, suit yourself.

75
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,045
What about you, Starck?

76
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,965
Would you like
something hot and black inside you?

77
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,509
- Is that an offer?
- It is not.

78
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,762
- Then how about some coffee?
- Starck?

79
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,056
- Yes, sir.
- Why aren't you on the bridge?

80
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,391
Do you mind if I get dressed first?

81
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,227
As a matter of fact, Lieutenant,
I do mind if you get dressed first.

82
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,730
Let's go, people. We have a job to do.

83
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:15,734
Okay, Denny, here we go.
Happy birthday.

84
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,027
Piay horsey, Mommy. Piay horsey.

85
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,488
Hey, no more ball in the house.

86
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,491
You're the one who can't catch.

87
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:27,495
- Yo, apologize.
- Sorry about that, Mama Bear.

88
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,080
- All right.
- All right, then.

89
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,040
- Peters.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,918
I did try to find a replacement for you,

91
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,755
but with such short notice,
it was impossible.

92
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,214
I am sorry.

93
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,260
I talked to my ex.
He's going to take Denny for Christmas.

94
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,472
I'll get him for the summer, so

95
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,223
everything's all right.

96
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,850
Smitty.

97
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,060
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,

98
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,937
in approximately
2 hours and 23 minutes,

99
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,065
we'll be arriving in the orbit of Neptune.
Thank you very much.

100
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,359
- I thank you.
- That's good.

101
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,279
All boards are green.
Everything's five by five.

102
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,907
- U.S.A.C. Been notified of our position?
- Yes, sir.

103
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,742
- All right, people, listen up.
- D.J.

104
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,911
As you all know,
we have an addition to our crew.

105
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,330
Dr. Weir, you care to join us?

106
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:14,501
Introductions all around.
This is my XO, Lieutenant Starck.

107
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,252
Mr. Justin, Engineering.

108
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,004
The funky spaceman over here
is Mr. Cooper.

109
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,298
What exactly is it you do
on board this ship, Coop?

110
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,051
Listen up, Doc,
I'm your best friend, okay?

111
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,512
I am the lifesaver and the heartbreaker.

112
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,430
He's a rescue technician.

113
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:31,601
This is Peters, medical technician.
And my pilot, Mr. Smith.

114
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,230
The gloomy Gus
in the corner over there, that's...

115
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,649
D.J. Trauma.

116
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,402
All right, all right.

117
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,614
Now we all know each other.
Skipper, I got a question.

118
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,658
What the fuck
are we doing way out here?

119
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:50,245
Perhaps the good doctor
will be kind enough to tell us.

120
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,955
Thank you.

121
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,833
First of all,
I want to say how much I appreciate

122
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,210
- this opportunity to join you on what I...
- It's for sure

123
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:00,672
that you appreciate being here, Doctor,
but you must understand that we don't.

124
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,549
We were taken off
a well-deserved leave

125
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,175
and sent into Neptune space.

126
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,762
We are now three billion klicks
from the nearest outpost.

127
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,683
The last time U.S.A.C. Attempted
a rescue this far past the outer reach,

128
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,019
well, we lost both ships.
So, if you please...

129
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,021
Right. Well...

130
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:21,818
Everything I'm about to tell you
is considered Code Black by the NSA.

131
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,112
U.S.A.C. Intercepted
a radio transmission

132
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,948
from a decaying orbit around Neptune.

133
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:31,619
The source of this transmission
has been identified

134
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,621
as the Event Horizon.

135
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,042
Yeah, well, that's bullshit, for starters.

136
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,296
- Skipper, you took me off leave...
- Thank you so much.

137
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,172
Smitty, sit down.

138
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,010
Cooper, as you were.

139
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,387
Let the man speak.

140
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,389
What was made public
aboutthe Event Horizon,

141
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,892
that she was a deep space
research vessel,

142
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:58,062
that her reactor went critical,
and that the ship blew up,

143
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,731
none of that is true.

144
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:03,234
The Event Horizon was the culmination
of a secret government project

145
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,821
to create a spacecraft
capable of faster-than-light flight.

146
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,991
I don't... Excuse me.
See, you can't actually do that.

147
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,828
The law of relativity
prohibits faster-than-light travel.

148
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:18,082
Relativity, yes.
We can't break the law of relativity.

149
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,501
We can go around it.

150
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,587
The ship doesn't really go faster
than light.

151
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,673
What it does is
it creates a dimensional gateway

152
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,842
that allows it to jump instantaneously

153
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,345
from one point of the universe
to another light years away.

154
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,679
How?

155
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,892
- Well, it's difficult to... It's all math.
- Try us, Doctor.

156
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,896
Right, well, using layman's terms,

157
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,607
we use a rotating magnetic field

158
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:46,945
to focus a narrow beam of gravitons.
These in turn fold space-time,

159
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,113
consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics,

160
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,950
until the space-time curvature
becomes infinitely large

161
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,535
and you produce a singularity.
Now, the singularity...

162
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,371
Layman's terms.

163
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,415
Fuck layman's terms.
Do you speak English?

164
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,547
Lmagine, for a minute,
that this piece of paper...

165
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,051
Excuse me.
That's Vanessa, and that's mine.

166
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,929
Attractive piece of paper
represents space-time

167
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:17,266
and you want to get from
point "A" here

168
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,185
to "B" there.

169
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,355
Now, what's the shortest distance
between two points?

170
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,898
A straight line.

171
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,733
Wrong.

172
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,778
The shortest distance
between two points is zero.

173
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,989
And that's what the gateway does.

174
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,492
It folds space.

175
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:39,330
So that point "A" and point "B" co-exist
in the same space and time.

176
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:44,377
When the spacecraft passes
through the gateway,

177
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,504
space returns to normal.

178
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,257
It's called a gravity drive.

179
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,803
- How do you know all this?
- I built it.

180
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,431
Well, I can see why they sent you.

181
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,225
So if the ship didn't blow up,
then what happened?

182
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:03,354
Well, the mission was going perfectly,
like a textbook.

183
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,940
They reached safe distance
using conventional thrusters.

184
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,900
All systems looked good.

185
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,944
They had the go-ahead to use
the gravity drive

186
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,697
to open the gateway
to Proxima Centauri

187
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,159
and then, they just disappeared.

188
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:20,079
Vanished without a trace, until now.

189
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,166
Where's she been
for the last seven years, Doctor?

190
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,294
That's what we're here to find out.

191
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,630
Now, we've been unable
to verity life contact,

192
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:34,343
but TDRS did receive
this single transmission.

193
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,565
- What the fucking hell is that?
- Listen to this.

194
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:51,152
Houston passed the same recording
through several filters,

195
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:55,364
managed to isolate what appears to be
a human voice.

196
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,792
I'm not even sure
if it qualifies as language.

197
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,919
- Latin.
- What?

198
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,172
I mean, I think it sounds like Latin.

199
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,008
- Can you translate it?
- Play it again.

200
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,681
Right there. You hear that?

201
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,939
Sounds like, "Liberate me,"
something or other.

202
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,065
I can't make out the rest.

203
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,900
"Liberate me?"

204
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,694
Save me.

205
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,907
All right. Stations, people.

206
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:55,716
Crossing the Horizon.
Optimum approach angle is 14 degrees.

207
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,303
- Come around to 334.
- Heading 334, sir.

208
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,140
Make your approach vector negative,
14 degrees.

209
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,391
1-4 degrees.

210
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,439
We have lock on Event Horizon's
navigation beacon.

211
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,692
She's in the upper ionosphere

212
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,945
and it looks like we're in
for some very heavy chop, sir.

213
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,618
- Bring us in nice and tight, Mr. Smith.
- Sir.

214
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:26,539
- Mr. Justin, how's my ship?
- Smooth sailing, sir.

215
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,749
Matching speed on my mark.

216
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:33,212
Three, two, one. Mark.

217
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,261
- Range?
- 10,000 meters and closing, sir.

218
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,429
- Starck.
- Yes, sir.

219
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,431
Get on the horn.
See if anybody is listening.

220
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,516
This is the US Aerospace
command vessel

221
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,604
Lewis & Ciark hailing Event Horizon.
Event Horizon, do you read?

222
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,980
Dr. Weir.

223
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,610
- I think you'll want to see this.
- Where is she?

224
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,653
Dead ahead. 5,000 meters!

225
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,865
- Starck? Anybody home?
- Event Horizon, do you read?

226
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,992
3,000 meters and closing!

227
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,748
I can't see a thing.

228
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,500
1,500 meters, sir.
We're getting too close.

229
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,712
- Where is it?
- The scope is lit. It's right in front of us.

230
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,381
- 1,000 meters.
- Proximity warning!

231
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:21,135
900, 800, 700.

232
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,763
- We're right on top of her, sir!
- We're gonna hit.

233
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,641
- Starck!
- It's right there! God!

234
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,645
Reverse thrusters. Full!

235
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,409
There she is.

236
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,014
Jesus.

237
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,226
Very impressive ship, Doctor.

238
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,355
- Thank you.
- Mr. Smith, are you up for a flyby?

239
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,774
Yes, sir. Yes, I'd love to.

240
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,041
That's the main airlock,
we can dock in there.

241
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,960
All right, Smith.

242
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:39,547
Use the arm and lock us
onto that small antenna cluster.

243
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,766
We should go very carefully here.
That's not a load-bearing structure.

244
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,603
Is now, Doctor.

245
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,693
- Everything five by five?
- Locked in to the Event Horizon.

246
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,903
Thank you, Smitty.
Light them if you got them.

247
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,239
Thank you very much, sir.

248
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,577
- Starck, give me a read.
- The reactor's still hot.

249
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,871
We've got several
small radiation sources,

250
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,998
but no leaks.
Probably it's nothing serious.

251
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,583
- Do they have pressure?
- Affirmative.

252
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:20,421
The hull's intact, but there's no gravity,
and the thermal units are off-line.

253
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,214
I'm showing deep cold.

254
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,592
The crew couldn't survive
unless they were in stasis.

255
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,969
- Find them, Starck.
- Yeah, I'm already on it, Captain.

256
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,721
Bio-scan on the line.

257
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,351
There's something wrong with the scan.

258
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,562
- Is it radiation interference?
- There's not enough to throw it off.

259
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:40,524
I'm picking up trace life forms,
but I can't get a lock on their location.

260
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,486
These readings are all over the ship.
It doesn't make any sense.

261
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,989
Okay, we do it the hard way.
Deck by deck, room by room.

262
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,699
Starck, deploy the umbilicus.

263
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,659
Smitty, fire up the boards
in the war room.

264
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,495
Sir.

265
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,705
Mr. Justin,
I believe you're up for a walk?

266
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,165
Yes, sir.

267
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,213
Doctor, I'm gonna need you here
on the bridge.

268
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,631
Captain,

269
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,217
I didn't come out all this way
just to sit on your bridge.

270
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,552
- I need to be on that ship.
- Once we've secured the ship,

271
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,554
- we'll bring you on board.
- No, I'm sorry, that's unacceptable.

272
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,182
- I need to be on that ship.
- Once we've secured the ship.

273
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,433
That's the way it is.

274
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,310
I need you to guide us
from the com station.

275
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,438
This is where I need you.
Help us do our job.

276
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,788
Honey, honey, you forgot your briefoase.

277
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,592
Stand clear.

278
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:54,140
- Anything gets funky, Cooper...
- I'll be on it.

279
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,936
Yo, Baby Bear, keep your nose clean.

280
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,028
D.J., showtime.

281
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,450
Video feed is clear.

282
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:16,120
- Are you with us, Dr. Weir?
- Yes, I'm with you.

283
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,622
We are crossing the umbilicus,

284
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,625
making our approach
to the Event Horizon.

285
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,338
You're at the outer airlock door.

286
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,508
Magnetic boots on.

287
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,057
We've got pressure.

288
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,704
Place is a deep freeze.

289
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,417
We got ice crystals everywhere.

290
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,004
That's the central corridor
that you're in now.

291
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,673
It connects the personnel areas
at the front of the ship

292
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,342
to Engineering at the rear.

293
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,263
- Mr. Justin, you take Engineering.
- Yes, sir.

294
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,350
Peters and I'll take the forward decks.

295
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,278
Doctor, what are these?

296
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,699
Yeah, I've got another one over here.
They are all over the place.

297
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,867
In an emergency,

298
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,454
they destroy the central corridor
and split the ship in half

299
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,625
and then the crew can use
the foredecks as a lifeboat.

300
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,884
I'm in Medical. No casualties.

301
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,140
Place looks like it's never been used.

302
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,892
You stiii haven't seen any crew?

303
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,770
If we saw any crew, Doctor,
you'd know it by now.

304
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,148
Scanning for life readings.

305
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,487
This place is a tomb.

306
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,117
Fuck me!

307
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,995
Miiier. Miiier, are you okay?

308
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,747
Looks like Skipper got a case
of the willies.

309
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,916
Cooper, get back to your post.

310
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,419
Miiier, your heart rate
just went through the roof.

311
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,004
I'm fine.

312
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:40,097
I think I've reached the door
to the first containment, Dr. Weir.

313
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,433
The Engineering decks
are on the other side.

314
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,643
Okay, let's take a look.

315
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,122
What the hell is this place, Dr. Weir?

316
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,291
It aiiows you to enter
the second containment

317
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,044
without compromising
the magnetic fieids.

318
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,214
Looks like a meat grinder to me.

319
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,054
I'm on the bridge.

320
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,064
Got some blood here.

321
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:48,040
There must have been a coolant leak.
Man, this shit is everywhere.

322
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:53,796
Coolant level's on reserve,
but well within the safety line.

323
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,143
Miss Peters,
could you turn back and left?

324
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,731
- What is it?
- Ship's log.

325
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,961
It's stuck.

326
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,757
It's pretty jammed in there.

327
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,435
What the hell happened to his eyes?

328
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,355
- Explosive decompression.
- Decompression doesn't do that.

329
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:58,986
Looks iike it was caused by...
i don't know, an animai or something.

330
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:02,614
Look at the damage to the soff tissue,
massive abrasions.

331
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,867
Corpse-sicle.

332
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,538
I'm scanning for life forms.

333
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:18,213
Man, I'm getting some
really strange readings in here.

334
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,020
Let me see if I can get some power up.

335
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,866
That's the core, the gravity drive.

336
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,041
The heart of the ship.

337
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:13,227
Justin. Justin, you're breaking up.

338
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,739
Justin, come in.

339
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,502
- What is it?
- I don't know.

340
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,504
The life scan just went off the scale.

341
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,976
Something's wrong, Starck.
Pull him out. Pull him out.

342
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,358
Shit!

343
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,864
He's in trouble.

344
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,116
- Go, Coop.
- I'm gone.

345
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,157
Boarding party, sound off.

346
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,243
This is Miller. Can anybody hear me?

347
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,711
- What the fuck was that?
- Pressure emergency!

348
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:06,089
We've lost the starboard baffle.
The hull's been breached!

349
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,801
I'll contain it here for as long as I can!
Get out!

350
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,929
We're losing atmosphere.

351
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,308
There are pressure suits in the airlock.
Go!

352
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,143
Here I come. Here I come.

353
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,358
Hold on, Baby Bear.

354
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,735
I'm almost there, almost there.

355
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,408
I got you. I got...

356
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,119
Watch out. Watch...

357
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,248
I got you. What the fuck is this?

358
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,125
Hold on.

359
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,881
Captain Miller.
Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.

360
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,969
- Smitty, where you been all my life?
- We have a major situation here, sir.

361
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,472
We've lost the starboard baffle,
and the hull's been breached.

362
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,266
The safety circuits, they have failed.

363
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,185
- Do we have time for a weld?
- No, sir.

364
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:04,356
We've got 218 liters of gas left, sir,
and then we've got nothing.

365
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,984
The oxygen tanks, they failed,
they're broken.

366
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,320
- Sir, we are fucking dead!
- What about the Event Horizon?

367
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,072
What?

368
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,992
- She's got air and power.
- It's our only chance.

369
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,202
There's no way
I'm getting on that bastard.

370
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,996
We don't even know
what happened on that ship.

371
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,914
It beats dying, Mr. Smith.

372
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,085
I want all personnel on board
the Event Horizon, pronto.

373
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,171
- We'll meet at the air tanks.
- I'm ahead of you, sir.

374
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,133
Bringing all thermal units online.

375
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,136
Hold tight. Prep for G's.

376
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,513
Gravity in five seconds.

377
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,823
Wake up, open your eyes. All right?
Just hang in there.

378
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,348
Dr. Weir.

379
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,185
Well,

380
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,146
I brought most primary systems online,

381
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,106
- for now.
- Thank you.

382
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,985
- Starck, what's our status?
- The antenna array is completely fried.

383
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,280
We've got no radio,
no laser, no high gain.

384
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,199
No one's coming to help us.

385
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,285
- This air tastes bad.
- Yeah, carbon dioxide, I know.

386
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,662
It's building up
with every breath we take.

387
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,290
And the CO2 filters
on the Event Horizon are shot.

388
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,917
So, we take the scrubbers
from the Clark.

389
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:50,003
- That gives us what?
- Enough breathable air for 20 hours,

390
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,255
but after that,
we'd better be on our way home.

391
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:12,275
I'm on the port side of the hull,
approaching the dorsal heat sink.

392
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,697
Holy shit.

393
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,248
Captain Miller. Captain Miller,
do you copy? Over.

394
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,708
I copy, Mr. Smith. How's my ship?

395
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,670
Sir, we've got a 7-meter fracture
on the outer hull.

396
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:35,048
We shouid be abie to repair her,
but it'ii take an awfui iot of time, sir.

397
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,717
Negative. 20 hours, we run out of air.

398
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,136
Understood, sir.

399
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,598
What happened here, Doctor?

400
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,487
Okay, how is he?

401
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:02,117
His vital signs seem stable,
but he's unresponsive to stimuli.

402
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,035
I don't know.

403
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,584
He might wake up in 15 minutes.

404
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,421
He might not wake up at all.

405
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,257
Look, Skipper,
I know this shit sounds weird,

406
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:21,803
but, I mean, there was like nothing,
and then Justin appeared,

407
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:26,516
and it was liquid,
and the whole core just turned solid.

408
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,268
It's just not physically possible.

409
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:31,271
Doctor, please. Please,
don't start in with that physics shit.

410
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,356
I'm telling you, I saw it.

411
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,942
Mr. Cooper,
it would mean the gateway was open.

412
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,821
- That's it. The gateway was open.
- The gateway couldn't be open

413
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,324
because the gravity drive
wasn't activated.

414
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,201
Look, I'm telling you what I saw, Doc!
So...

415
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:48,622
- It can't just start up by itself.
- Mr. Cooper, you are out of line.

416
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,918
Doctor, Mr. Justin may die.
Now, I have to assume

417
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:56,379
that whatever happened to him
could happen to all of us.

418
00:36:56,464 --> 00:37:01,176
Mr. Cooper says he saw something.
I believe he saw something.

419
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,304
I need an explanation.

420
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:12,020
In my view, Mr. Cooper's delusional,
if you don't mind my saying so.

421
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:15,440
But maybe he saw an optical effect

422
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,359
caused by gravitational distortion.

423
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,527
"An optical effect"?
That's fucking poetic.

424
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,488
- Where the fuck...
- Cooper!

425
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,698
I'm sorry. All right.

426
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,954
Gravitational distortion.
What could create that, Doctor?

427
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:33,458
Lf, somehow, a burst of gravity waves
escaped from the core,

428
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:38,463
it could distort space-time.
It could make Justin seem to disappear.

429
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:42,008
It could also
have damaged the Lewis & Clark.

430
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:47,639
- However, I think this is entirely unlikely.
- What's in the core, Doctor?

431
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:49,891
It's complicated.

432
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,727
How much time do you need?
We have,

433
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,313
17 hours and 48 minutes.

434
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,358
What's in the core?

435
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,821
This is the gateway.

436
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,782
Now, these three magnetic rings,
when they align,

437
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,118
it creates an artificial black hole

438
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,912
which allows the ship to travel
to any point in space.

439
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,791
A black hole, the most destructive force
in the universe.

440
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,752
- And you've created one?
- Absolutely, yes.

441
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:22,924
Because we can use that
immense power to bend space-time.

442
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,594
Look, it would take the Lewis & Clark
1,000 years

443
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,930
to reach our nearest star.

444
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,474
Butthe Event Horizon
could be there in a day.

445
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,728
- Lf it worked.
- You can come down. It's perfectly safe.

446
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:43,403
So, if Mr. Justin was sucked
through your gateway,

447
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,989
he could've gone wherever
the Event Horizon's been.

448
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,533
Theoretically, yes.
But as I told you before,

449
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:52,495
- the gateway can't just open by itself.
- I see.

450
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,289
Lieutenant, I want this room sealed off.

451
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,249
Second containment from here on in
is off-limits.

452
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,960
- Yes, sir.
- Captain, there's no danger.

453
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,087
The gateway's
contained behind three magnetic fields.

454
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,757
- It's perfectly safe.
- Safe?

455
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,216
Doctor, my ship is in pieces

456
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:08,011
and one of my crewmen
may not make it home alive.

457
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,597
No one else goes near this thing.

458
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,452
Come on.

459
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,457
There's got to be something on this log.

460
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,210
You can do this.

461
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,340
D.J.?

462
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:09,030
- D.J., where are you?
- I'm up on Deck 4.

463
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,043
Mommy.

464
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,141
Peters!

465
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,733
What is it? You all right?

466
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,002
What's up? You was out there so long,

467
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,837
I thought you were
trying to break my record.

468
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:51,174
Listen, I'd rather spend the next
12 hours outside

469
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,635
than another five seconds
in this shit can.

470
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,095
It's the final entry in the ship's log.

471
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:59,432
I want to say how proud i am
of my crew.

472
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,684
I'd iike to name my station heads:

473
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,853
Chris Chambers, Janice Reuben,

474
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,023
Ben Fender, Dick Smith.

475
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,652
We've reached safe distance...

476
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,445
This is John Kilpack, ship's captain.

477
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,949
...and we're preparing to engage
the gravity drive,

478
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,952
and open the gateway
to Proxima Centauri.

479
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,040
Haii and fareweii.

480
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,717
- What is that?
- I'll run it through a few filters,

481
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,928
see if I can clean it up.

482
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,476
- It's a power drain.
- It's the core.

483
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,729
Stay here. Look after Justin.

484
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,648
I don't want anybody else
near that thing.

485
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,941
Wait for me, Doctor.

486
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:55,405
- What's causing the drain?
- Magnetic fields are holding.

487
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:58,741
Maybe a short in the fail-safe circuit.
I'll check it.

488
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,410
Can you give us a hand?

489
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,640
Justin.

490
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,684
Justin, can you hear me?

491
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,812
- He's coming.
- Who's coming?

492
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,649
The dark.

493
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,877
Yeah, that's the one.

494
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:34,921
Biiiy.

495
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,641
Miller!

496
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,435
Captain Miller!

497
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,771
I've got some problems here.

498
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,444
Be with me,

499
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:00,738
forever.

500
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,498
Dr. Weir?

501
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:40,236
Carbon dioxide can produce
hallucinations, impair judgment.

502
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,405
God damn it, D.J.,
it was not a hallucination.

503
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:43,865
All right.

504
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:46,325
Doctor, you were in the duct.

505
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,953
You must have heard something.

506
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,832
- You must have seen something.
- I did.

507
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,585
About an hour ago, I saw my son

508
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:58,212
lying on the examination table

509
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,967
- and in his legs were...
- Miss Peters...

510
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,886
...crawling...
...if you don't mind my saying so,

511
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,220
it sounds a little like shock.

512
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,139
- Could it be that you're traumatized...
- No. No.

513
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:10,892
...by seeing the body on the...
- Excuse me. No!

514
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,104
I've seen bodies before.
This was different.

515
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,106
She's right. Now, this was real.

516
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,859
I felt... I felt heat.

517
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:22,862
This is not something
that's in our heads.

518
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:27,992
Smitty, have you seen anything unusual
at all?

519
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,078
No, I haven't seen anything,
and I don't need to see anything, sir,

520
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,331
but I can tell you

521
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,374
this ship is fucked.

522
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:38,127
Thank you for that scientific analysis,
Mr. Smith.

523
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,296
Well, you don't expect
to figure it out, do you?

524
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,339
All right, Doc.

525
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:42,632
When you break
all the laws of physics,

526
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,133
you seriously think
there won't be a price?

527
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:47,470
You already killed the last fucking crew.
And now you want to kill us as well!

528
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:50,014
- It's just a fucking ship, all right?
- D.J.!

529
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:53,184
It's just a ship, do you understand?
It's just a big hunk of metal.

530
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:56,062
- There's nothing odd going on.
- D.J.?

531
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,193
- Fine.
- D.J.?

532
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:08,032
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm just...

533
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:10,076
I'm sorry.

534
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,786
- Damn it!
- Smitty.

535
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,996
- It's all right. That's it.
- Fucking...

536
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,583
That's enough! I want you calm,
I want you cool! Now!

537
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:22,171
- All right.
- You're going back upstairs.

538
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,382
You're going outside on the Clark
with Cooper,

539
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:26,884
and you're going to repair the ship.
No mistakes.

540
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,762
Mistakes, nobody goes home.
Understood?

541
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,473
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

542
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,892
- Sir.
- Get moving.

543
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,693
- Miller.
- What is it, Starck?

544
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:46,487
I ran the bio-scan
with the DNA-RNA filters.

545
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:47,822
The results were bio readings...

546
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,532
Of an indeterminate origin. Yes, I know.

547
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,368
Don't you have anything useful
to tell me, Lieutenant?

548
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:55,246
- I've got a theory.
- Let's hear it.

549
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:58,833
I think that there's a connection between
the readings and the hallucinations,

550
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:01,252
like they're all part
of a defensive reaction,

551
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,587
some sort of immune system.

552
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,255
I don't have time to listen to this.

553
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,798
- You have to listen to me.
- To what?

554
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:09,385
I'm saying that this ship is reacting to us
and the reactions are getting stronger.

555
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,345
It's as if the ship
brought back something with it,

556
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,014
a life force of some kind.

557
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,725
What are you telling me?
That this ship is alive?

558
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,519
You wanted an answer,
and it's the only one I've got.

559
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:22,106
No, what I want, Lieutenant,
is to survive the next 10 hours.

560
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,235
Justin?

561
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:15,701
Justin!

562
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,130
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

563
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,506
- What's that?
- What is it?

564
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,008
- You heard it.
- What did you hear?

565
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,509
- What is it?
- Peters, listen to me.

566
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,885
It's D.J., all right?

567
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,971
I didn't hear anything.
Neither of us heard anything.

568
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,347
- So just calm down, all right?
- Okay.

569
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,433
- Get your breath back.
- Okay.

570
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,643
- Now, tell me.
- I was...

571
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,817
Make it stop! Make it stop!

572
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,778
Open the door.

573
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,740
Stop moving!

574
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:41,495
- No!
- Weir, stop. Stop him!

575
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,456
What're you doing?

576
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:50,629
In our current environment, Dr. Weir,
self-control is an asset.

577
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,304
What is it?

578
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,015
The forward airlock.

579
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,101
Miller, Smith, Cooper,
anyone in the airlock?

580
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,978
That's a negative, Starck.

581
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:07,855
Justin.

582
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,318
- Justin.
- Don't!

583
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,986
Justin, no!

584
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:16,947
Justin, no! Justin, open the door.

585
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,867
Miller, come in.

586
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,828
Miiier, come in. We have an emergency.

587
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,789
What's going on in there, Starck?

588
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:27,416
- Justin's in the airlock.
- Say again.

589
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,377
Justin is in the airlock
and he is not wearing a suit.

590
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,838
- Shit. I'm on it.
- As you were, sailor.

591
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:35,466
- Skipper, you need me on this.
- I need you right where you are.

592
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,384
He's engaged the override.

593
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,512
- Can you shut it down?
- I'll try.

594
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,263
Coming to him, Starck.

595
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,225
Justin! Open this door, now!

596
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,313
Starck, give me status.

597
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:51,315
You better hurry.
He's engaged the override

598
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:53,609
- and we can't open the inner door.
- I'll get the kit.

599
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:56,487
Justin, open the door!

600
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:04,036
Justin, open the door.

601
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:06,455
- Did you hear it?
- Keep him talking.

602
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,959
Yes. Yes, I heard it.
Do you know what it is?

603
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:12,044
It shows you things,

604
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:15,381
- horrible things.
- What does?

605
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:19,718
The dark inside me
from the other place.

606
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,972
- I won't go back there. I won't.
- No, Baby Bear.

607
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,807
- Come on, open the door.
- What's happening?

608
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:27,143
- I don't think she can talk him down.
- She'd better.

609
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,436
If he opens the airlock,
he's going to turn inside out.

610
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,981
- No. You stay with me.
- Almost got it.

611
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,441
- I've almost got it.
- You stay with me, Justin.

612
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,152
Come on, now. Open that door!

613
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:39,655
If you could see the things I've seen,
you wouldn't try to stop me.

614
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,949
No, that's not you talking.
That's not you talking.

615
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,076
That's it. That's it, right there.

616
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,829
Open the door. Go for that button.
Come on.

617
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,080
Okay.

618
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,083
No!

619
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,922
Captain, Justin just activated the door.
It's on a 30-second delay.

620
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,091
Justin!

621
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:06,432
Stand by for decompression
in 25 seconds.

622
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,351
Where am I?

623
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,604
- Hey.
- Starck, get it fucking open!

624
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,938
- Hey, open the door.
- I can't.

625
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,524
The inner door won't open
when the outside door's been triggered.

626
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,693
- It'd decompress the entire ship.
- Oh, my God.

627
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,613
Mama Bear, open the door.

628
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,406
Come on, please.

629
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,367
- Captain!
- Patch me through to him.

630
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,203
Captain Miller, tell them
to open the door.

631
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,121
They can't do that, Justin.

632
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:32,041
- I don't want to die in here.
- You're not gonna die.

633
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:36,337
I want you to listen to me very carefully,
and I'm gonna get you out of there.

634
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,925
Oh, my God.

635
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,801
It's starting.

636
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,721
- My eyes.
- Don't think about them. Shut them.

637
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,973
Just shut them as tight as you can.

638
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,183
Five seconds.

639
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:52,561
Tuck yourself into a crouch position.
Make yourself into a ball now.

640
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:55,731
I can't breathe. Ch, God.

641
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:58,234
Oh, God, it hurts.

642
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,571
I want you to huff and puff
and blow all the air out of your lungs.

643
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,658
Do you hear me?
All the air out of your lungs, Justin.

644
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,994
Do it, now!

645
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,675
Okay, Baby Bear.

646
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:28,514
Got him. I got him. Stand by, people.

647
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:29,932
Standby.

648
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:35,437
- We've got pressure.
- We're coming, Justin. We're coming.

649
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,651
I'm going to need five units here.
Hold his head still.

650
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,653
Okay.

651
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,032
Give me some more glycerin, now.

652
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,701
One thing at a time,
iet's keep him breathing.

653
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:49,910
Christ, he's bieeding out.

654
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:52,871
- Pressure's stiii dropping.
- Start the drip, 15 cc.

655
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:04,800
I've stopped the bleeding,
stabilized him best I can.

656
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:09,138
He won't be pretty, but he should live

657
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:12,057
- if we make it back.
- We'll make it.

658
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,894
Starck, what's our time like?

659
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,897
CO2 levels will become toxic
in four hours.

660
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:20,899
All right.

661
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,736
Peters, we've got to find out
what happened to the other crew

662
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,488
before the same thing happens to us.

663
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:30,826
I can work on the log on the bridge,
but I won't go back to Medical.

664
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:33,579
- Fine.
- Yes, sir.

665
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,208
Justin said something about,

666
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,337
"the dark inside me."

667
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,256
What's that mean?

668
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,342
Doctor?

669
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,929
I don't think it means anything.

670
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,895
Don't you walk away from me, mister.

671
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,357
I'd like some answers, Doctor.

672
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:04,026
I'd like to know why one of my men
tried to commit suicide

673
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:08,280
by throwing himself out of an airlock.
I'd like to know what caused that noise.

674
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,990
Look, thermal changes in the hull

675
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:13,369
could've caused the metal
to expand and contract rapidly,

676
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:14,995
causing reverberations.
This is possible.

677
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:19,124
Bullshit! You built this fucking ship.
You've given me nothing but bullshit.

678
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,460
What do you want me to say?

679
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:25,547
You said the ship's drive
creates a gateway.

680
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,299
- Yeah.
- To what?

681
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,511
- I don't know.
- Where did it go?

682
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:33,555
- Where did you send it?
- I don't know.

683
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,058
Where has it been
for the last seven years?

684
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,226
Look, I don't know.

685
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,395
"I don't know,"
is not good enough, Doctor.

686
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,355
You're supposed to be
the fucking expert.

687
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,565
I need answers. That's your job.

688
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:47,486
- Now, the other place, where is that?
- I don't know! I don't know!

689
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,405
Look,

690
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:52,199
there's a lot of things
happening around here

691
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:55,744
that I don't fully understand. I need time.

692
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,330
I see.

693
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:02,167
Well, that's exactly
what we don't have, Doctor.

694
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,674
Captain!

695
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:24,606
Don't ieave me!

696
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,321
Piease!

697
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:38,495
For God's sakes, heip me!

698
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,299
It's in your head.

699
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,887
It's just in your head.

700
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,200
God help us.

701
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,333
I'm telling you, it was his voice I heard.

702
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:28,253
He was calling to me.
A young bosun named Eddie Corrick.

703
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:32,674
We served on the Goliath together.

704
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:38,180
When the O2 tanks ruptured,
four of us made it to the lifeboat.

705
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:42,684
But Corrick was still on board
the Goliath when the fire broke out.

706
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,604
You ever seen fire in zero gravity?

707
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,107
It's beautiful.

708
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:53,028
It's like liquid.

709
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:56,448
It slides all over everything.

710
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,368
Comes up in waves.

711
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,413
And they just kept hitting him,

712
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,457
wave after wave.

713
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,295
He was screaming for me to save him.

714
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,965
What did you do?

715
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:15,801
I did the only thing I could.

716
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:21,223
I closed the lifeboat hatch,
and I left him behind.

717
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,813
I swore I'd never lose another man.

718
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:31,275
I've known you a long time.

719
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:36,154
- You never told me that.
- That's just it, D.J., I never told anybody.

720
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,825
But this ship knew about it.

721
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:44,246
It knows my fears. It knows my secrets.

722
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,292
Gets inside your head,
and it shows you.

723
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,170
I wasn't going to tell you this.

724
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:57,175
I've been listening to the distress signal.

725
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:58,844
And I...

726
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,932
I think I made a mistake
in the translation.

727
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:13,942
Go on.

728
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:17,529
I thought it said "liberate me."

729
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:19,615
Save me.

730
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,659
But it's not "me."

731
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,204
It's "iiberate tutume."

732
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,832
Save yourself.

733
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,460
And it gets worse.

734
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:36,381
There.

735
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:39,051
I think,

736
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:42,971
that says "ex inferis."

737
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,141
"Save yourself,

738
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:49,895
"from hell."

739
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:54,900
Look, if what Dr. Weir tells us is true,

740
01:00:56,402 --> 01:01:00,238
this ship has been beyond
the boundaries of our universe

741
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:02,574
of known scientific reality.

742
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,244
Who knows where it's been,

743
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:08,413
what it's seen,

744
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,918
and what it's brought back with it.

745
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:14,628
From hell.

746
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:22,094
You don't believe in that kind of stuff,
do you?

747
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:28,308
Whoever sent that message,
he sure believes in hell.

748
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:30,852
Captain Miiier.

749
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,067
Whatever it is, Coop, it better be good.

750
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,235
Yes, sir.

751
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:41,071
Ready to repressurize the Clark
and get the heii out of here.

752
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:42,572
On my way.

753
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:49,454
Come on, baby, don't let me down.

754
01:01:57,255 --> 01:02:00,215
Hello, baby. Papa's home.

755
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,384
She's holding.

756
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:04,845
Oh, shit.

757
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:07,848
Skipper, we're still venting
trace gasses.

758
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:10,016
Give me about 20 minutes
to plug the hole.

759
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:14,855
Cooper, you are the iifesaver.
20 minutes and we're underway.

760
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,735
Shit.

761
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:26,783
- Got any coffee?
- Yeah, but it's cold.

762
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,118
Great.

763
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:39,671
Starck.

764
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:46,261
Miller?

765
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:08,533
We're leaving.

766
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:13,455
No, we can't leave.

767
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:16,541
Our orders are specific.

768
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,503
Rescue the crew,
salvage what's left of the ship.

769
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:22,547
The crew is dead, Doctor.
Your ship killed them.

770
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:25,842
- We came here to do a job.
- We're aborting, Doctor!

771
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:29,805
Starck, download the files
from the Event Horizon's computers.

772
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:32,098
D.J., I want you to get Justin prepped

773
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,475
and ready to move him back
to the Clark.

774
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:36,019
There's stuff I wanna get from medical.
We'd better move him in the tank.

775
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:37,771
No problem. Do it.

776
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:40,899
- Peters.
- Yes, sir.

777
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,109
I want you to get the CO2 scrubbers
back into the Clark.

778
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:45,320
- Take Smitty with you.
- Right.

779
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:49,825
Captain.

780
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:55,288
- Don't do this.
- It's done.

781
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,959
What about my ship?
You can't just leave her.

782
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:00,710
I have no intention of leaving her,
Doctor.

783
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,796
I will take the Lewis & Clark
to a safe distance,

784
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,423
and then I will launch tac missiles
atthe Event Horizon,

785
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:09,094
until I'm satisfied she's vaporized.
Fuck this ship.

786
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:20,230
Captain Miller,
the bio-scan just went off the scale.

787
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:21,690
It looks like the core

788
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:24,192
is draining power
from the rest of the ship.

789
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:27,153
Get the files. Vacate.
I want off this ship.

790
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:30,699
You can't leave. She won't let you.

791
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:33,410
You just get your gear and get back
on the Lewis & Clark Doctor,

792
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:35,579
or you'll find yourself walking home.

793
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,539
I am home.

794
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,457
Let's go!

795
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:41,209
Ready?

796
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:43,753
Shot.

797
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,172
Come on.

798
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:48,800
- Ready?
- Shot.

799
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,682
- Shot.
- Okay.

800
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:58,393
Peters, can we go?
This place is really freaking me out.

801
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:00,103
Yeah, you wanna breathe
on the way home.

802
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:02,397
- No, I don't! Let's go!
- Shit!

803
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,316
- 25.
- Come on!

804
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,401
- We need 25.
- Peters!

805
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:08,612
Come on! Got it!

806
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,341
Oh, no. Peters.

807
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:43,058
Oh, God.

808
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:50,023
Biiiy.

809
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:01,409
Claire?

810
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:09,959
Claire.

811
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,296
It's me. I'm home.

812
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,342
I'm home.

813
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:24,265
I know I wasn't there
when you needed me,

814
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:27,185
and I'm sorry I...

815
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:31,064
I let my work come between us.

816
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,278
God, Claire, no.

817
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:41,783
I'm begging you, please. Please, don't.

818
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:43,868
Not again, please.

819
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:53,586
I've been so...

820
01:08:55,422 --> 01:08:57,423
Billy.

821
01:08:58,092 --> 01:08:59,759
It's all right.

822
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:06,307
- I've been so alone.
- You'll never be alone again.

823
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:11,479
You're with me now. You're with me

824
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:16,359
and I have such wonderful,
wonderful things

825
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:18,987
to show you.

826
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,883
Damn, I'm good.

827
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:45,930
Coop.
Coop, how long are you going to take?

828
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:47,640
'Cause i've got to get
the heii out of here.

829
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:50,393
Look, you can kiss my ass, Smith,
'cause I'm done.

830
01:09:50,477 --> 01:09:52,729
Just give me a second
to collect my tools

831
01:09:52,813 --> 01:09:54,147
and we can get out of Dodge.

832
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:56,399
- Two minutes tops.
- Roger that.

833
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:03,531
Weir.

834
01:10:04,074 --> 01:10:05,408
Dr. Weir.

835
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:11,581
Weir!

836
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:15,752
Dr. Weir,
get your ass back on board now!

837
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:17,462
Weir!

838
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:19,631
Shit.

839
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:22,467
Captain Miller,
Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.

840
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:25,261
Captain Miiier.
Captain Miiier, do you copy? Over.

841
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:26,471
Go ahead, Smitty.

842
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:29,515
I've just seen Weir
messing around on the Clark sir.

843
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:34,229
Stand by, Smitty,
I wanna check something out.

844
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:42,237
- Smith, get out of there.
- Come again, sir?

845
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:44,239
One of the expiosives is missing
from the corridor.

846
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:46,741
- Weir might have put it on the Clark.
- No. No way.

847
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:49,452
No, sir, no way.
I've just put it back together, sir.

848
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:51,871
Get off the Clark now, Smith!

849
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:03,049
Where the fucking hell are you?

850
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:27,198
Got you.

851
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,242
Hang on, Smitty. I'm coming!

852
01:11:43,215 --> 01:11:44,257
No!

853
01:11:51,557 --> 01:12:36,476
Shit!

854
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:38,186
Where the fuck am I going?

855
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:41,272
Why does this shit got to happen to me?
Fuck.

856
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:45,568
All right, think, Coop. Think. Think.

857
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:49,739
All right, I got to get back to the ship.
I got to get back to the ship, all right.

858
01:12:49,823 --> 01:12:53,368
I gotta blow my air tank.
I'll blow my air tank.

859
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:56,204
All right. Fuck.

860
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:59,457
This better work. This shit better work.
All right.

861
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:03,669
Here I go. All right.
One, two, three. Come on.

862
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:07,298
Come on. Yes!

863
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:11,219
Here I come, motherfuckers!

864
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:19,185
D.J.

865
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,522
- What was that?
- Clark's gone.

866
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:26,359
- Smitty and Cooper are dead.
- What? What the...

867
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:29,487
it was Weir.
You spot him, you take him out.

868
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:31,239
Understood.

869
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:34,826
- Be carefui, D.J.
- Don't worry about Weir.

870
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:37,703
I'll take care of him.

871
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:48,881
D.J.?

872
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:04,772
D.J.? D.J., answer me!

873
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:54,739
Okay, Dr. Weir.

874
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:01,579
You don't wanna leave your ship?

875
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,081
You never will.

876
01:16:03,141 --> 01:16:04,183
Starck.

877
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,040
It's okay.

878
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:34,338
I'm gonna get you out of here.

879
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:38,551
Okay.

880
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:44,223
Easy.

881
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,782
Oh, my God.

882
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:05,536
What happened to your eyes?

883
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:09,457
Where we're going,
we won't need eyes to see.

884
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:11,459
What are you talking about?

885
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:15,463
I created the Event Horizon
to reach the stars.

886
01:17:16,256 --> 01:17:19,550
But she's gone
much, much further than that.

887
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:23,387
She tore a hole in our universe,

888
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:27,058
a gateway to another dimension.

889
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:30,102
A dimension of pure chaos,

890
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:33,397
pure evil.

891
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:37,360
When she crossed over,
she was just a ship.

892
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:39,570
But when she came back,

893
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:43,074
she was alive.

894
01:17:44,284 --> 01:17:46,118
Look at her, Miller.

895
01:17:47,412 --> 01:17:50,456
Isn't she beautiful?

896
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:54,919
Your beautiful ship
killed its crew, Doctor.

897
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:57,254
Well,

898
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:01,133
now she has another crew.

899
01:18:02,969 --> 01:18:05,304
Now she has us.

900
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:15,022
What do you think you're doing, Doctor?

901
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:18,275
You wanted to know where the ship
has been,

902
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:20,986
so now you'll find out.

903
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:39,213
- Lf you miss me, you blow out the hull.
- What makes you think I'll miss?

904
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:42,508
That's right, I'm back!

905
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:45,386
I'm... Shit, I can't stop. Hey!

906
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:47,471
Hey! Fuck.

907
01:18:49,349 --> 01:18:52,351
What? Who the fuck? Oh, shit!

908
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:30,407
Miller! Miller!

909
01:20:43,129 --> 01:20:44,922
Give me your hand!

910
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:56,267
- Come on!
- I can't!

911
01:20:58,103 --> 01:20:59,937
I'm not leaving you.

912
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:21,625
Forward airlock.

913
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,591
It can't be Weir.

914
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:31,802
I'm not taking any chances.

915
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:34,305
You watch your back.

916
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,276
- Yo! Don't hit me.
- Cooper!

917
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:50,154
Take it off! Take it off!

918
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:53,240
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
- You're okay.

919
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:56,994
- You're okay. It's over.
- No, it's not.

920
01:21:57,621 --> 01:22:00,372
Weir's activated the gravity drive.
We got to shut it down.

921
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:02,458
- How? The bridge is gone.
- What about Engineering?

922
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:03,792
You think you can shut it down
from there?

923
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:06,378
I don't know the process.
Dr. Weir was the expert.

924
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:08,422
I don't want to go
where the other crew went, okay?

925
01:22:08,506 --> 01:22:09,798
- I'd rather be dead.
- Okay.

926
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:12,259
- Okay, we blow the fucker up.
- We blow it up?

927
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:15,512
Do like Weir said. Blow the corridor,

928
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:20,267
separate us from the rest of ship.
Use the foredecks as a lifeboat.

929
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,937
With any luck, TDRS will pick up
our emergency beacon.

930
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:25,314
We prep the gravity couches,
put ourselves in stasis,

931
01:22:25,398 --> 01:22:27,149
and stand by
for a search and rescue team.

932
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:29,610
Meantime, I'm gonna go
manually arm these explosives.

933
01:22:29,694 --> 01:22:31,904
- Skipper, will this shit work?
- It worked for Dr. Weir.

934
01:22:31,988 --> 01:22:34,281
You go activate the emergency beacon.
You get back here double-quick.

935
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:36,158
- Yes, sir.
- I'll come with you.

936
01:22:36,242 --> 01:22:38,327
You stay here.
You prep the gravity couches.

937
01:22:38,411 --> 01:22:39,495
Miller.

938
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:44,041
Close this door behind me, Lieutenant.

939
01:22:53,843 --> 01:22:57,888
Gateway opening in T minus
five minutes.

940
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:06,689
Emergency beacon activated.

941
01:23:08,566 --> 01:23:10,401
Yes.

942
01:23:10,568 --> 01:23:11,902
Blood?

943
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:21,078
Oh, fuck me.

944
01:23:21,746 --> 01:23:23,247
Fuck me.

945
01:23:24,207 --> 01:23:49,898
Starck!

946
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:55,654
Run!

947
01:23:58,324 --> 01:24:02,745
Gateway opening in T minus
three minutes.

948
01:24:06,624 --> 01:24:09,793
Detonator reiease is authorized.

949
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:13,464
The main corridor is now armed.

950
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:15,758
We're armed. She's ready to blow.

951
01:24:16,092 --> 01:24:19,094
I repeat, we are armed.
She's ready to blow.

952
01:24:19,512 --> 01:24:21,930
Miller. Miller, can you hear me?

953
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:24,099
We have to get out of here now.

954
01:24:26,644 --> 01:24:28,353
You let me burn.

955
01:24:45,997 --> 01:24:50,667
Gateway opening in T minus
two minutes.

956
01:25:06,976 --> 01:25:08,018
Miller.

957
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:29,665
You left me behind.

958
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:35,087
No, you're not Edmund Corrick.
I watched him die.

959
01:25:39,509 --> 01:25:41,009
Weir?

960
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:47,474
The ship brought me back.
I told you she won't let me leave.

961
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:49,768
She won't let anyone leave.

962
01:25:49,894 --> 01:25:52,688
Did you really think
you could destroy this ship?

963
01:25:53,022 --> 01:25:56,066
She's defied space and time.

964
01:25:56,609 --> 01:26:00,112
She's been to a place
you couldn't possibly imagine.

965
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:01,947
And now,

966
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:06,660
- it is time to go back.
- I know, to hell.

967
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:10,122
You know nothing. Hell is only a word.

968
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:14,918
The reality is much, much worse.

969
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:20,591
Now let me show you.

970
01:26:21,968 --> 01:26:23,260
Help me!

971
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:28,432
No!

972
01:26:30,476 --> 01:26:32,186
No.

973
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:34,021
- You see?
- No.

974
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:37,816
They're not dead. They're not dead.

975
01:26:37,942 --> 01:26:39,318
Not yet.

976
01:26:41,112 --> 01:26:43,071
You won't

977
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:46,241
take my crew.

978
01:27:06,012 --> 01:27:09,848
They're not your crew anymore.
They belong to the ship.

979
01:27:09,974 --> 01:27:11,433
Gateway opening.

980
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:27,824
Take me.

981
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,535
You take me. You leave them alone.

982
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:34,164
No. There is no escape.

983
01:27:36,292 --> 01:27:38,126
The gateway is open,

984
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:41,171
and you are all coming with me.

985
01:27:45,843 --> 01:27:57,187
Do you see?

986
01:27:59,857 --> 01:28:01,191
Yes,

987
01:28:02,568 --> 01:28:04,361
I see.

988
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:09,408
No!

989
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:31,239
Miller.

990
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:41,625
This is Rescue One. We have contact.

991
01:29:43,252 --> 01:29:46,630
Approaching the wreckage
of the Event Horizon.

992
01:29:46,714 --> 01:29:48,298
Prepare to board.

993
01:29:57,892 --> 01:30:00,268
I'm entering the grav couch bay.

994
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:04,940
It doesn't appear to have been damaged
in the explosion.

995
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:08,652
There appear to be three survivors:

996
01:30:09,112 --> 01:30:12,406
Cooper, Justin, Lieutenant Starck.

997
01:30:13,157 --> 01:30:16,076
Justin seems to have suffered
massive injuries

998
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,911
but he's still alive.

999
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:22,332
The grav couches still have power.

1000
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:27,170
I'm opening the first tank now.

1001
01:30:37,306 --> 01:30:39,433
It's all right. It's okay.

1002
01:30:39,517 --> 01:30:41,435
- You're safe now.
- Justin, Cooper.

1003
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:43,854
They're fine. They're with us.

1004
01:30:45,356 --> 01:30:47,023
They're with us.

1005
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:52,946
- Starck. Starck.
- Stay calm. It's all right.

1006
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:54,948
- Calm down, it's me.
- Breathe deeply.

1007
01:30:55,032 --> 01:30:56,241
- Starck.
- Breathe deeply.

1008
01:30:56,325 --> 01:30:58,452
- It's the rescue team.
- I need a sedative here, now!

1009
01:30:58,536 --> 01:31:01,455
- I got you, Starck. I got you.
- It's okay.

1010
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:03,290
I need a sedative here, now!

1011
01:31:03,374 --> 01:31:05,375
Starck, it's the rescue team. We're safe.

1012
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:08,211
- Okay, okay, I need it now!
- We're safe.
