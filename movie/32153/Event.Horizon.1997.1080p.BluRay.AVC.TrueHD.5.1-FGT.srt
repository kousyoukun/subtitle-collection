00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:12,290
但其飞越海王星后  消失于无形

6
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,140
成为有史以来最严重的太空灾难

7
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,810
2047年  现在 ...

8
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,250

We are prepped for lockdown.

16
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,290
离谱到极
I can't believe it, this is ridiculous.

17
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:07,300
苦等了半个月  却碰到这差事
I haven't got more than my hand in the last six weeks, and now this shit.

18
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,510
为什么不去火星? 彼德丝
I mean, why can't we go to Mars, Captain?

19
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:14,010
- 火星有女人嘛 - 说得对
- I mean, Mars has got women. - Smith's right.

20
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,760
海王星什么都没有
Neptune, there's nothing out there.

21
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,100
我们会孤立无援
Yeah, and if the shit goes down, we'll be on our own.

22
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,890
各位都知道规矩
You know the rules, people.

23
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,020
哪里出事 我们去哪里 好了 出发吧
Someone drops the ball, we get the call. Now, let's go.

24
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,230
- 航线怎样?  - 制定妥当
- Have you got our course plotted in? - Yes, sir.

Everything's green on my screen, Skipper.

27
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,320

35
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,300
- 船长 - 彼德丝
- Skipper. - Peters.

36
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,180
米勒船长  我想 ...
Captain Miller, I just wanted to say this is something...

37
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,390
博士  我们要赶时间
Clock is ticking, Doctor.

38
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,480
史密夫  要三催四请吗?
You waiting for a personal invitation, there, Mr. Smith?

39
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,230
- 不是的  - 船长 我不想 ...
- No, sir. - Captain, I don't want to take up...

40
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,110
请跟大家去引力缸
Doctor, if you'll just follow the rest of the crew to the grav tanks,

41
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,440
快出发了
we're almost underway.

42
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,450
修妥那个箱子
That bunk better be squared away, Mr. Cooper,

43
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,240
否则要走路去海王星
or you'll find yourself walking to Neptune.

44
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,620
还要干什么? 彼德丝
What's the hold-up, Peters?

45
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,620
还有些二氧化碳清除器未搬上船  船长
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers, sir.

46
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,660
请你站在这里
You stand right here.

47
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,750
谢谢你  DJ
Thanks, D.J.

48
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,500
- 先脱帽 - 先生
- Hats off in the tank. - Sir.

49
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,250
- 初次躺引力缸? - 嗯
- First time in a grav couch? - Yeah.

50
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,470
船长不喜欢我?
I think your captain has some kind of a problem with me.

51
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,760
哦 别管他
Oh, well. Don't worry about him.

52
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,490
他不习惯有陌生乘客
He just loves having complete strangers on his ship.

53
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,350
DJ呢
DJ

54
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,220

不
No.

56
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,810
必须要注射吗?
Is this necessary?

57
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,820
离子推进器一发动 引力有30个G那么大
When the ion drive fires, you'll be taking about 30 G's.

58
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,160
没有保护 你的骨头就会被压成水
Without a tank, the force would liquety your skeleton.

59
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,080
我见过老鼠受引力作用的后果
I've seen the effect on mice.

60
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,290
畏惧局促?
Claustrophobic?

61
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,040
十分畏惧
Very.

62
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,740

Biiiy.

64
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,950

I'm so aione.

65
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,120

66
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,960
有人在这里吗?
Is anyone there?

67
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,850
天
Oh, God.

68
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,010
比利
Biiiy?

69
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,220
我很冷
I'm so coid.

70
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,440
克莱尔
Claire.

71
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,030
我在等着
I'm waiting.

72
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,290

75

好了 来

76
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,680
慢慢来  你冬眠了56日
Now move nice and slow. You've been in stasis for 56 days.

77
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,470
精神会有些恍惚  明白吗?
You're gonna experience a little disorientation, you understand?

78
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,270
- 我没事  谢谢 - 拿着 不用急
- I'm all right now, thank you. - Okay, take that. Don't rush it.all yours.

00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,450
- 要咖啡吗?  - 什么?
- Want some coffee? - What?

81
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,990
你要咖啡吗?
Would you like some coffee?

82
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,490
不要了  谢谢
No. Thank you.

83
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,500
好吧 随便你
All right, suit yourself.

84
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,040
你呢? 舒泰克
What about you, Starck?

85
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,960
要不要吮吸些又热又黑的东西?
Would you like something hot and black inside you?

86
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
- 有兴趣吗?  - 没有
- Is that an offer? - It is not.

87
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,760
- 那么 要咖啡吗? - 舒泰克

88
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,050
- 船长 - 怎么不到指挥室?
- Yes, sir. - Why aren't you on the bridge?

89
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,390
介意我先穿衣服吗?
Do you mind if I get dressed first?

90
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,220
老实说 介意 我先穿衣服
As a matter of fact, Lieutenant, I do mind if you get dressed first.

91
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,730
大家快点 有正事办
Let's go, people. We have a job to do.

92
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,730
丹尼  他会走  生日快乐
Okay, Denny, here we go. Happy birthday.

93
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:00,020
妈咪  骑牛牛

94
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,480
室内不准玩球
Hey, no more ball in the house.

95
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,490
你是唯一能追不上
You're the one who can't catch.

96
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,490
抱歉 对不起 妈妈

我试过找别人代替你
I did try to find a replacement for you,

100
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,750
但匆忙间找不到
but with such short notice, it was impossible.

101
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,210
很对不起
I am sorry.

102
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:24,260
我跟前夫商量好 丹尼跟他过圣诞

所以没关系
everything's all right.

105
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,850

118
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,290
你自我介绍吧
What exactly is it you do on board this ship, Coop?

119
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,050
听着 我是你最好的朋友
Listen up, Doc, I'm your best friend, okay?

120
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,510
专门救人身 伤人心
I am the lifesaver and the heartbreaker.

121
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,430
他是救援技师

好的 好的
All right, all right.

126
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,610
介绍完毕  我有个问题
Now we all know each other. Skipper, I got a question.

127
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,650
为什么老远跑到这里来?
What the fuck are we doing way out here?

128
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,240
也许博士愿意赐教
Perhaps the good doctor will be kind enough to tell us.

129
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,950
谢谢
Thank you.

130

你当然欣慰

132
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,670
但要知道我们并不欣慰
that you appreciate being here, Doctor, but you must understand that we don't.

133
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,540
取消假期
We were taken off a well-deserved leave

134
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,170
来到这海王星

The last time U.S.A.C. Attempted a rescue this far past the outer reach,

137
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,020
都同归于尽
well, we lost both ships. So, if you please...Right. Well...

138
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,810
以下我们说的话  是极度机密
Everything I'm about to tell you is considered Code Black by the NSA.

139
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,110
总署接到一个电讯
U.S.A.C. Intercepted a radio transmission

140
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,940
发自海王星的上空
from a decaying orbit around Neptune.

141
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,610
经查证  电讯来自 ...
The source of this transmission has been identified

142
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,620
新领域号
as the Event Horizon.

143
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,040
呵 吹牛
Yeah, well, that's bullshit, for starters.

144
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,290
取消假期 为了这个 非常感谢
Skipper, you took me off leave...Thank you so much.

145
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,170
阿什  坐下
Smitty, sit down.

146
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,010
谷巴  你也是
Cooper, as you were.

147
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,380
听他说下去
Let the man speak.

148
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,380
我们曾经对外公布 新领域号
What was made public aboutthe Event Horizon,

149
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,890
在探索外太空时
that she was a deep space research vessel,

150
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:40,060
因为反应炉负荷过度所以炸毁
that her reactor went critical, and that the ship blew up,

151
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,730
其实并非如此
none of that is true.

152
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:45,230
新领域号是政府秘制的太空船
The Event Horizon was the culmination of a secret government project

153
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,820
目的是要飞得超过光速
to create a spacecraft capable of faster-than-light flight.

154
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,990
恕我插嘴 那不可能 根据相对论
I don't... Excuse me. See, you can't actually do that.

155
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,820
没有东西快过光速
The law of relativity prohibits faster-than-light travel.

156
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:00,080
对  我们不可以违背相对论
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity.

157
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,500
但可以避重就轻
We can go around it.

158
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,580
那艘船不能快过光速
The ship doesn't really go faster than light.

159
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,670
但能够打开一条时空通道
What it does is it creates a dimensional gateway

160
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,840
能够刹那间  在宇宙中
that allows it to jump instantaneously

161
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,340
从一处到好多光年之外的另一处
from one point of the universe to another light years away.

162
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,670
怎样去?
How?

163
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:17,890
- 要用复杂的数学才能解释 - 不妨一试
- Well, it's difficult to... It's all math. - Try us, Doctor.

164
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,890
简单来说
Right, well, using layman's terms,

165
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,600
我们采用挡磁场
we use a rotating magnetic field

166
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,940
将一小束引力子集中起来
to focus a narrow beam of gravitons. These in turn fold space-time,

167
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,110
然后  按照维尔氏张力学把时空折叠
consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics,

168
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,950
直到时空曲率变成无限大
until the space-time curvature becomes infinitely large

169
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,530
从而产生一个奇点
and you produce a singularity. Now, the singularity...

170
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,370
说通俗点
Layman's terms.

171
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,410
他妈的  说通俗点 你能不能使用人懂的语言?
Fuck layman's terms. Do you speak English?

172
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,540
假设这张纸...
Lmagine, for a minute,that this piece of paper...

173
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:52,050
那是云尼莎的海报  是我的
Excuse me. That's Vanessa, and that's mine.

174
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,920
这幅美女代表时空
Attractive piece of paper represents space-time

175
00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:01,180
你要从这一点A到那一点B去
and you want to get from point "A" here to "B" there.

176
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,350
两点之间最短的距离是什么?
Now, what's the shortest distance between two points?

177
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,890
连一条线段
A straight line.

178
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,730
错
Wrong.

179
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,770
两点之间最短的距离为零
The shortest distance between two points is zero.

180
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,980
时空通道的作用就是
And that's what the gateway does.

181
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,490
将空间折叠
It folds space.

182
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:21,330
使A点和B点同时同地出现
So that point "A" and point "B" co-exist in the same space and time.

183
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,370
新领域号穿过通道后
When the spacecraft passes through the gateway,

184
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,500
空间回复正常
space returns to normal.

185
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,250
这过程叫引力推进
It's called a gravity drive.

186
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,800
- 你怎么知道得这样清楚? - 船是我制造的
- How do you know all this? - I built it.

187
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,430
难怪派你来
Well, I can see why they sent you.

188
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,220
船既然没有炸毁  发生了什么事?
So if the ship didn't blow up, then what happened?

189
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,350
起初  航程顺利
Well, the mission was going perfectly, like a textbook.

190
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,940
分毫不差 用一般推进器驾驶到
They reached safe distance using conventional thrusters.

191
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,900
安全距离外
All systems looked good.

192
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,940
然后获准发动引力推进器
They had the go-ahead to use the gravity drive

193
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,690
打开到近纪时间区的通道
to open the gateway to Proxima Centauri

194
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,150
跟着  船就消失了
and then, they just disappeared.

195
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,070
无踪无影  直到现在
Vanished without a trace, until now.

196
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,160
七年来  船到过哪里?
Where's she been for the last seven years, Doctor?

197
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,290
我们来 正为了寻找答案
That's what we're here to find out.

198
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,630
我们不知道有没有活人
Now, we've been unable to verity life contact,

199
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,340
但罗斯福站却接到这电讯
but TDRS did receive this single transmission.

200
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,560
- 究竟是什么鬼? - 听着
- What the fucking hell is that? - Listen to this.

201
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,150
休斯敦总部把电讯过虑了好几次
Houston passed the same recording through several filters,

202
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,360
得到一把似乎是人的声音
managed to isolate what appears to be a human voice.

203
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,790
不知道是不是语言
I'm not even sure if it qualifies as language.

204
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,910
- 拉丁 - 什么?
- Latin. - What?

205
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,170
我是说 似乎像拉丁语
I mean, I think it sounds like Latin.

206
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,000
- 你能够翻译吗? - 再播一次
- Can you translate it? - Play it again.

207
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,680
就在这里 听到吗?
Right there. You hear that?

208
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,930
似乎是"释吾"
Sounds like, "Liberate me," something or other.

209
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,060
其他的我不明白
I can't make out the rest.

210
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,900
"释吾"?
"Liberate me?"

211
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,690
救我
Save me.

212
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,900
大家回到岗位去
All right. Stations, people.

213
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,710
驶向水平线  最佳角度14度
Crossing the Horizon. Optimum approach angle is 14 degrees.

214
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,300
- 方向3-3-4 - 方向3-3-4
- Come around to 334. - Heading 334, sir.

215
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,140
航线矢向调到负1-4度
Make your approach vector negative, 14 degrees.

216
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,390
1-4度
1-4 degrees.

217
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,430
已经瞄准了新领域号的导航台
We have lock on Event Horizon's navigation beacon.

218
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,690
那船在电离层顶部
She's in the upper ionosphere

219
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,940
我们似乎 遇到强烈气流
and it looks like we're in for some very heavy chop, sir.

220
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,610
向前慢驶 史密斯
Bring us in nice and tight, Mr. Smith.Sir.

221
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,530
- 船的情况怎么样?  - 支撑得住
- Mr. Justin, how's my ship? - Smooth sailing, sir.

222
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,740
准备调整速度
Matching speed on my mark.

223
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,210
三  二  一  开动
Three, two, one. Mark.

224
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,260
- 距离?  - 一万米  逐渐接近
- Range? - 10,000 meters and closing, sir.

225
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,420
- 舒泰克  试试通话 - 好的  船长
- Starck. - Yes, sir.

226
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,430
得到按喇叭 看是否有人听
Get on the horn. See if anybody is listening.

227
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,510
这是太空总署的侠侣号
This is the US Aerospace command vessel

228
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,600
新领域号  你们听到吗?
Lewis & Ciark hailing Event Horizon. Event Horizon, do you read?

229
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,980
韦博士
Dr. Weir.

230
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,610
- 过来看看 - 那船在哪里?
- I think you'll want to see this. - Where is she?

231
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,650
新领域号  正面五千米
Dead ahead. 5,000 meters!

232
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,860
- 舒泰克 有没有回应?  - 新领域号 你们听到吗?
- Starck? Anybody home? - Event Horizon, do you read?

233
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,990
三千米  接近中
3,000 meters and closing!

234
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,740
什么也见不到
I can't see a thing.

235
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,500
一千五百米  太接近了
1,500 meters, sir. We're getting too close.

236
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,710
- 在哪里? - 警戒讯号已经亮起  在前面
- Where is it? - The scope is lit. It's right in front of us.

237
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,380
- 一千米 太接近  - 小心
- 1,000 meters. - Proximity warning!

238
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,130
九百 八百 七百
900, 800, 700.

239
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,760
- 我们在它上面 - 会撞船
- We're right on top of her, sir! - We're gonna hit.

240
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,640
- 舒泰克 - 就在那里 老天
- Starck! - It's right there! God!

241
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,640
倒推  全力
Reverse thrusters. Full!

242
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,400
就在那里
There she is.

243
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,010
老天
Jesus.

244
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,220
好壮观的船 韦博士
Very impressive ship, Doctor.

245
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:56,350
- 过奖 - 史密夫  准备同步飞行
- Thank you. - Mr. Smith, are you up for a flyby?

246
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,770
乐意之极
Yes, sir. Yes, I'd love to.

247
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,040
那主要气门锁上了 我们可以停泊
That's the main airlock, we can dock in there.

248
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,960
好的 史密夫
All right, Smith.

249
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,540
用机械臂将我们接上那板架去
Use the arm and lock us onto that small antenna cluster.

250
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:32,760
小心  那处不是用来负重的
We should go very carefully here. That's not a load-bearing structure.

251
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,600
现在是了
Is now, Doctor.

252
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,690
- 一切顺利?  - 接上了新领域号
- Everything five by five? - Locked in to the Event Horizon.

253
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,900
谢谢 如果有香烟  你可以抽
Thank you, Smitty. Light them if you got them.

254
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,230
谢谢船长
Thank you very much, sir.

255
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,570
- 舒泰克 有没有发现? - 反应炉仍然热
- Starck, give me a read. - The reactor's still hot.

256
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,870
有小量辐射泄露
We've got several small radiation sources,

257
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,990
但可能并不严重
but no leaks. Probably it's nothing serious.

258
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,580
- 船内有没有气压?  - 有
- Do they have pressure? - Affirmative.

259
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:02,420
船身完好 但里面没有引力 暖气系统停顿
The hull's intact, but there's no gravity, and the thermal units are off-line.

260
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,210
船内极度寒冷
I'm showing deep cold.

261
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,590
船员除非冬眠了 否则不能生存
The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.

262
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,960
- 探测船员 - 已经开始
- Find them, Starck. - Yeah, I'm already on it, Captain.

263
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,720
生物探测器开启
Bio-scan on the line.

264
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,350
探测不到
There's something wrong with the scan.

265
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,560
- 辐射的干扰? - 不会  辐射不够多
- Is it radiation interference? - There's not enough to throw it off.

266
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,520
有些生命迹象 但浮游不定
I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on their location.

267
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,480
似乎遍布全船  怪事
These readings are all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.

268
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:28,980
那么  我们逐层搜  逐房搜
Okay, we do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room.

269
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,690
舒泰克 放出连接带
Starck, deploy the umbilicus.

270
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,650
阿什 开动戒备系统
Smitty, fire up the boards in the war room.

271
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,490
好的
Sir.

272
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,700
泽斯汀  准备太空漫步
Mr. Justin, I believe you're up for a walk?

273
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,160
好的 船长
Yes, sir.

274
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,210
博士 你坐镇指挥室
Doctor, I'm gonna need you here on the bridge.

275
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,630
船长
Captain,

276
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,210
我一场来到 不是替你指挥
I didn't come out all this way just to sit on your bridge.

277
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,550
- 我必须上那船去 - 我们先确定情况
- I need to be on that ship. - Once we've secured the ship,

278
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,550
- 才接你过去 - 不 对不起 不能接受
- we'll bring you on board. - No, I'm sorry, that's unacceptable.

279
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,180
- 我必须上那船去 - 我们先确定情况
- I need to be on that ship. - Once we've secured the ship.

280
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,430
事情就是这样的
That's the way it is.

281
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,310
我们要你从这里教我们怎样走
I need you to guide us from the com station.

282
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,430
帮我们完成任务
This is where I need you. Help us do our job.

283
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,780
你忘记带工具箱
Honey, honey, you forgot your briefoase.

284
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,590
站开
Stand clear.

285
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,140
- 那些需要修理 - 我会修理
- Anything gets funky, Cooper... - I'll be on it.

286
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,930
熊宝宝 保重身体
Yo, Baby Bear, keep your nose clean.

287
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,020
DJ  开工了
D.J., showtime.

288
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,450
视像清晰
Video feed is clear.

289
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:58,120
- 听到吗? 韦博士 - 听到
- Are you with us, Dr. Weir? - Yes, I'm with you.

290
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,620
我们沿着连接带
We are crossing the umbilicus,

291
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,620
接近新领域号
making our approach to the Event Horizon.

292
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,330
你们在气锁门外
You're at the outer airlock door.

293
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,500
开动磁靴
Magnetic boots on.

294
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,050
有气压
We've got pressure.

295
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,700
船内冰冻
Place is a deep freeze.

296
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,410
到处是冰的结晶
We got ice crystals everywhere.

297
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,000
你们现在在走廊上
That's the central corridor that you're in now.

298
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,340
主廊连接船头的工作间和船尾的机房
It connects the personnel areas at the front of the ship to Engineering at the rear.

299
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,260
- 泽斯汀先生 你检查机房 - 好的 船长
- Mr. Justin, you take Engineering. - Yes, sir.

300
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,350
彼德丝和我检查船头
Peters and I'll take the forward decks.

301
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,270
博士 这些是什么?
Doctor, what are these?

302
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:17,690
这里也有 到处都有
Yeah, I've got another one over here. They are all over the place.

303
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,860
紧急情况用来炸毁走廊
In an emergency,

304
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,450
把船一分为二
they destroy the central corridor and split the ship in half

305
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,620
船员用船头作为逃生船
and then the crew can use the foredecks as a lifeboat.

306
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,880
我在医疗室 没有伤亡
I'm in Medical. No casualties.

307
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,140
医疗室似乎从来没有用过
Place looks like it's never been used.

308
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,890
仍然没有看见船员踪迹?
You stiii haven't seen any crew?

309
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,770
如果见到 早已告诉你
If we saw any crew, Doctor, you'd know it by now.

310
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,140
探测生命迹象
Scanning for life readings.

311
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,480
阴森得像坟墓
This place is a tomb.

312
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,110
他奶奶的
Fuck me!

313
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,990
米勒 你没事吧?
Miiier. Miiier, are you okay?

314
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,740
船长神经过敏
Looks like Skipper got a case of the willies.

315
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,910
谷巴 回去你的工作岗位
Cooper, get back to your post.

316
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,410
米勒 你心跳得很厉害
Miiier, your heart rate just went through the roof.

317
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,000
我没事
I'm fine.

318
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,090
韦博士  我到达第一个船舱
I think I've reached the door to the first containment, Dr. Weir.

319
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,430
机房就在另一边
The Engineering decks are on the other side.

320
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,640
好的 我们进去看看
Okay, let's take a look.

321
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:47,120
这究竟是什么地方?
What the hell is this place, Dr. Weir?

322
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,040
是用来防止干扰磁场的
It aiiows you to enter the second containment without compromising the magnetic fieids.

323
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,210
活像个碎肉机
Looks like a meat grinder to me.

324
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,050
我在指挥室内
I'm on the bridge.

325
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,060
这里有血迹
Got some blood here.

326
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,040
冷却剂漏了出来 到处都是
There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere.

327
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,790
漏了许多 但仍然安全
Coolant level's on reserve, but well within the safety line.

328
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,140
彼德丝 请你转过去 后左
Miss Peters, could you turn back and left?

329
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,730
- 什么东西? - 航行日志
- What is it? - Ship's log.

330
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,960
卡着了
It's stuck.

331
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,750
卡得相当紧
It's pretty jammed in there.

332
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,430
为什么他没有眼睛?
What the hell happened to his eyes?

333
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:35,350
- 因为急剧降压 - 降压不会造成那情形
- Explosive decompression. - Decompression doesn't do that.

334
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,980
似乎受了动物之类的袭击
Looks like it was caused by... i don't know, an animai or something.

335
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:44,610
软组织有大量擦伤痕迹
Look at the damage to the soff tissue, massive abrasions.

336
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,860
僵尸
Corpse-sicle.

337
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,530
我在探测生命迹象
I'm scanning for life forms.

338
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,210
测到很奇怪的读数
Man, I'm getting some really strange readings in here.

339
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,020
我试试加强照明
Let me see if I can get some power up.

340
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,860
那是引力推进器
That's the core, the gravity drive.

341
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,040
是船的核心
The heart of the ship.

342
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,220
泽斯汀 我们看不到你
Justin. Justin, you're breaking up.

343
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,730
泽斯汀 答话
Justin, come in.

344
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,500
- 什么事?  - 不知道
- What is it? - I don't know.

345
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,500
生命探测读数急升
The life scan just went off the scale.

346
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,970
情况不妙 叫他立刻撤退
Something's wrong, Starck. Pull him out. Pull him out.

347
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,350
噢 该死
Shit!

348
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,860
他有麻烦
He's in trouble.

349
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,110
- 去吧 谷巴 - 我们去
- Go, Coop. - I'm gone.

350
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,150
搜索队 声音中断
Boarding party, sound off.

351
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:35,240
我是米勒 有人听见吗?
This is Miller. Can anybody hear me?

352
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,710
- 什么回事? - 紧急失压
- What the fuck was that? - Pressure emergency!

353
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,080
右舷保护护板毁掉 船身破裂
We've lost the starboard baffle. The hull's been breached!

354
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,800
我尽量塞着  你们走
I'll contain it here for as long as I can! Get out!

355
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,920
气压下降
We're losing atmosphere.

356
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,300
气锁有气压衣 去
There are pressure suits in the airlock. Go!

357
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,140
泽斯汀 我来了
Here I come. Here I come.

358
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,350
熊宝宝
Hold on, Baby Bear.

359
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,730
我快到了 快到了
I'm almost there, almost there.

360
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,400
抓到你了
I got you. I got...

361
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,110
当心 当心...
Watch out. Watch...

362
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:22,240
抓到你了 怎么回事?
I got you. What the fuck is this?

363
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,120
稳住
Hold on.

364
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:29,880
米勒船长 听到吗?
Captain Miller. Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.

365
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:33,960
- 史密夫  你终于开金口 - 情况严重
- Smitty, where you been all my life? - We have a major situation here, sir.

366
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,470
右舷隔板毁坏  船身破裂
We've lost the starboard baffle, and the hull's been breached.

367
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,260
安全路线失灵
The safety circuits, they have failed.

368
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,180
- 赶得及接好吗?  - 赶不及
- Do we have time for a weld? - No, sir.

369
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,350
空气只剩下218公升
We've got 218 liters of gas left, sir, and then we've got nothing.

370
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,980
氧气缸破裂  报废
The oxygen tanks, they failed, they're broken.

371
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,320
- 我们死定了 - 新领域号呢?
- Sir, we are fucking dead! - What about the Event Horizon?

372
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,070
什么?
What?

373
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,990
- 有空气 动力 - 我们唯一机会
- She's got air and power. - It's our only chance.

374
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,200
那艘船邪门得很
There's no way I'm getting on that bastard.

375
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,990
我不想去
We don't even know what happened on that ship.

376
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,910
总好过坐以待毙
It beats dying, Mr. Smith.

377
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:07,080
所有船员登上新领域号  立即
I want all personnel on board the Event Horizon, pronto.

378
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,170
- 在气缸集合 - 我先去开启暖气
- We'll meet at the air tanks. - I'm ahead of you, sir.

379
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,130
小心  引力将恢复
Bringing all thermal units online.

380
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:18,510
引力5秒后恢复
Hold tight. Prep for G's.Gravity in five seconds.

381
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,820
泽斯汀 我要你 睁开眼睛 振作
Wake up, open your eyes. All right? Just hang in there.

382
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,340
韦博士
Dr. Weir.

383
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,180
怎么样?
Well,

384
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,140
我已经开动大部分基本系统
I brought most primary systems online,

385
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,100
- 暂时已经开动 - 谢谢
- for now. - Thank you.

386
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:13,980
- 我们的情况怎样? - 天线全部中断
- Starck, what's our status? - The antenna array is completely fried.

387
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,280
跟外界的通讯完全切断
We've got no radio, no laser, no high gain.

388
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,190
不会有救兵到
No one's coming to help us.

389
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,280
- 空气很难闻 - 我知道
- This air tastes bad. - Yeah, carbon dioxide, I know.

390
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,660
二氧化碳会随着我们的呼吸而增加
It's building up with every breath we take.

391
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,290
新领域号的二氧化碳清除器坏了
And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.

392
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,910
把侠侣号的带去
So, we take the scrubbers from the Clark.

393
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
那么  空气可以支持20小时
That gives us what? Enough breathable air for 20 hours,

394
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,250
之后  我们最好赶回家
but after that, we'd better be on our way home.

395
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,270
我在左舷  接近吸热器
I'm on the port side of the hull, approaching the dorsal heat sink.

396
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,690
该死
Holy shit.

397
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,240
米勒船长 米勒船长  听到吗?
Captain Miller. Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.

398
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,700
听到  我们的船怎么样?
I copy, Mr. Smith. How's my ship?

399
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,670
船外壳有一条7米裂缝
Sir, we've got a 7-meter fracture on the outer hull.

400
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:17,040
可以修理  但是需要时间
We shouid be abie to repair her, but it'ii take an awfui iot of time, sir.

401
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,710
尽快  空气只够20小时
Negative. 20 hours, we run out of air.

402
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,130
明白
Understood, sir.

403
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,590
这里出了什么事? 韦博士
What happened here, Doctor?

404
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,480
他怎样了?
Okay, how is he?

405
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:44,110
似乎活着  但是不省人事
His vital signs seem stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli.

406
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,030
很难说
I don't know.

407
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,580
可能15分钟之后醒来
He might wake up in 15 minutes.

408
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,420
可能永远不醒
He might not wake up at all.

409
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,250
我知道不合常理
Look, Skipper, I know this shit sounds weird,

410
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:03,800
但泽斯汀突然出现
but, I mean, there was like nothing, and then Justin appeared,

411
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,510
核心一时是液体  一时变成固体
and it was liquid, and the whole core just turned solid.

412
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,260
物理上不可能
It's just not physically possible.

413
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:13,270
韦博士  物理你个屁
Doctor, please. Please, don't start in with that physics shit.

414
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,350
我亲眼看见
I'm telling you, I saw it.

415
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,940
除非通道打开了
Mr. Cooper, it would mean the gateway was open.

416
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,820
- 对 通道的确打开了 - 引力推进器没有发动
- That's it. The gateway was open. - The gateway couldn't be open

417
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,320
怎打开?
because the gravity drive wasn't activated.

418
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,200
我只是照实直说
Look, I'm telling you what I saw, Doc! So...

419
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,620
- 推进器不能自己发动 - 你说话过火了 谷巴
- It can't just start up by itself. - Mr. Cooper, you are out of line.

420
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,910
泽斯汀先生可能死去
Doctor, Mr. Justin may die. Now, I have to assume

421
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,370
他所遇到的  我们也会遇到
that whatever happened to him could happen to all of us.

422
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,170
谷巴先生自称见过某些东西 我相信他见过
Mr. Cooper says he saw something. I believe he saw something.

423
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,300
我需要个解释
I need an explanation.

424
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:54,020
恕我老实说句  我认为谷巴先生眼花
In my view, Mr. Cooper's delusional, if you don't mind my saying so.

425
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,440
也许他见到的是引力歪曲
But maybe he saw an optical effect

426
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,350
所产生的视觉效应
caused by gravitational distortion.

427
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,520
视觉效应? 他妈的风凉话
"An optical effect"? That's fucking poetic.

428
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,480
- 风凉话... - 谷巴!
- Where the fuck... - Cooper!

429
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,690
行  我住口
I'm sorry. All right.

430
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,950
引力歪曲  怎样发生?
Gravitational distortion. What could create that, Doctor?

431
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:15,450
如果核心漏出一阵的引力浪
If, somehow, a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core,

432
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:20,460
这引力浪会造成时空歪曲 令泽斯汀似乎消失
it could distort space-time. It could make Justin seem to disappear.

433
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:24,000
也会损坏侠侣号
It could also have damaged the Lewis & Clark.

434
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:29,630
- 但我认为完全没有可能 - 核心内有什么?
- However, I think this is entirely unlikely. - What's in the core, Doctor?

435
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,890
相当复杂
It's complicated.

436
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:34,720
多久可以解释清楚? 我们有 ...
How much time do you need? We have,

437
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:37,310
17小时48分
17 hours and 48 minutes.

438
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,350
核心内有什么?
What's in the core?

439
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,820
这就是通道
This is the gateway.

440
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,780
那三个磁环排列好
Now, these three magnetic rings, when they align,

441
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,110
会形成一个人造黑洞
it creates an artificial black hole

442
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,910
船就可以驶去太空任何地点
which allows the ship to travel to any point in space.

443
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:56,790
黑洞  宇宙最大的杀伤力
A black hole, the most destructive force in the universe.

444
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,750
- 而你制造出来 - 确实 是的
- And you've created one? - Absolutely, yes.

445
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:04,920
我们运用那巨大的力量去扭曲时空
Because we can use that immense power to bend space-time.

446
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,590
瞧  侠侣号要一千年
Look, it would take the Lewis & Clark 1,000 years

447
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,930
才能驶到的星球
to reach our nearest star.

448
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:13,470
新领域号朝发夕至
Butthe Event Horizon could be there in a day.

449
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,720
- 行得通的话 - 下来吧 很安全
- If it worked. - You can come down. It's perfectly safe.

450
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,400
那么  泽斯汀如果被吸入通道
So, if Mr. Justin was sucked through your gateway,

451
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,980
会去了新领域号去过的地方
he could've gone wherever the Event Horizon's been.

452
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,530
在理论上是的  但正如我说的
Theoretically, yes. But as I told you before,

453
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:34,490
- 通道不可能自动打开 - 我明白
- the gateway can't just open by itself. - I see.

454
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,280
大副 封锁这间房
Lieutenant, I want this room sealed off.

455
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,240
不准任何人进出
Second containment from here on in is off-limits.

456
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:40,960
- 是 船长 - 船长  不用怕
- Yes, sir. - Captain, there's no danger.

457
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,080
那通道 有三个磁场包藏着
The gateway's contained behind three magnetic fields.

458
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,750
- 安全得很 - 安全?
- It's perfectly safe. - Safe?

459
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,210
我的船受创
Doctor, my ship is in pieces

460
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,010
一名船员垂危 韦博士
and one of my crewmen may not make it home alive.

461
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,590
谁也不准接近这东西
No one else goes near this thing.

462
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,450
来吧
Come on.

463
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:19,450
日志上必定有些线索
There's got to be something on this log.

464
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,210
可以的
You can do this.

465
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,340
DJ呢?
D.J.?

466
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,030
- DJ  你在哪里? - 在第四层
- D.J., where are you? - I'm up on Deck 4.

467
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,040
妈咪
Mommy.

468
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,140
彼德丝!
Peters!

469
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,730
什么事? 觉得怎样?
What is it? You all right?

470
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,000
你出去那么久
What's up? You was out there so long,

471
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,830
差点破我记录
I thought you were trying to break my record.

472
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,170
听着  我宁可在外面呆上12个小时
Listen, I'd rather spend the next 12 hours outside

473
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,630
也不愿在这鬼船上呆5秒钟
than another five seconds in this shit can.

474
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,090
航行日志的最后记录
It's the final entry in the ship's log.

475
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:41,430
我很以我的船员为荣
I want to say how proud i am of my crew.

476
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,680
容我一提各船员的名字
I'd iike to name my station heads:

477
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,850
基斯张波斯 珍妮丝吕宾
Chris Chambers, Janice Reuben,

478
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,020
班范达  迪克史密夫
Ben Fender, Dick Smith.

479
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,650
我们已经抵达安全的距离
We've reached safe distance...

480
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,440
他是船长  乔伯
This is John Kilpack, ship's captain.

481
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:57,940
正在准备发动引力推进器
...and we're preparing to engage the gravity drive,

482
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,950
打开通往近纪时空区的通道
and open the gateway to Proxima Centauri.

483
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,040
等待我们的佳音 后会有期
Haii and fareweii.

484
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:18,920
- 什么事?  - 我会试试弄清晰点儿
- What is that? - I'll run it through a few filters,see if I can clean it up.

485
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:25,470
- 动力泄露 - 核心
- It's a power drain. - It's the core.

486
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,720
别走开  陪着泽斯汀
Stay here. Look after Justin.

487
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,640
不得接近核心  博士
I don't want anybody else near that thing.

488
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:31,940
等我
Wait for me, Doctor.

489
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:37,400
- 为什么泄露动力? - 磁场正常
- What's causing the drain? - Magnetic fields are holding.

490
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,740
可能线路烧了 我去检查一下
Maybe a short in the fail-safe circuit. I'll check it.

491
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,410
帮帮手 行吗?
Can you give us a hand?

492
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,640
泽斯汀
Justin.

493
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,680
泽斯汀 你听见吗?
Justin, can you hear me?

494
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,810
- 他来了 - 谁来了?
- He's coming. - Who's coming?

495
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,640
黑暗 啊
The dark.

496
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,870
毛病在这里
Yeah, that's the one.

497
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:57,250
比利
Billy.

498
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,440
比利
Billy.

499
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,740
比利
Billy.

500
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,640
米勒!
Miller!

501
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,430
米勒船长
Captain Miller!

502
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,770
我有麻烦
I've got some problems here.

503
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,440
陪我
Be with me,

504
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,730
永远陪我
forever.

505
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,490
韦博士
Dr. Weir?

506
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:22,230
二氧化碳可以令人产生幻觉
Carbon dioxide can produce hallucinations, impair judgment.

507
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,400
胡说  DJ  那不是幻觉
God damn it, D.J., it was not a hallucination.

508
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,860
好了
All right.

509
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:28,320
博士 你在管道里
Doctor, you were in the duct.

510
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:30,950
必定听到什么
You must have heard something.

511
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,830
- 必定见到什么 - 我见到 ...
- You must have seen something. - I did.

512
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,580
1小时前 我见到我的儿子
About an hour ago, I saw my son

513
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,210
躺在手术桌上
lying on the examination table

514
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,960
- 他的腿 ... - 彼得丝...
- and in his legs were... - Miss Peters...

515
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:46,880
如果你不介意的话 我想说有点像休克
...crawling... ...if you don't mind my saying so,it sounds a little like shock.

516
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,130
- 你可能受惊过度 - 不 不
- Could it be that you're traumatized... - No. No.

517
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,890
- 会不会因为看见死尸?  - 对不起 不会
- ...by seeing the body on the... - Excuse me. No!

518
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:57,100
死尸我见过 那是另一回事
I've seen bodies before. This was different.

519
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,100
她说得对  这是真的
She's right. Now, this was real.

520
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,850
我明明感到热力
I felt... I felt heat.

521
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,860
不是幻觉
This is not something that's in our heads.

522
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,990
阿什 你有没有见到怪事?
Smitty, have you seen anything unusual at all?

523
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:13,070
没有  但不需要见到
No, I haven't seen anything, and I don't need to see anything, sir,

524
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,330
我可以肯定
but I can tell you

525
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:17,370
这艘船邪门得很
this ship is fucked.

526
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,120
谢谢你的科学分析
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mr. Smith.

527
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,290
嗯 别指望了 好吗?
Well, you don't expect to figure it out, do you?

528
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,330
好 博士
All right, Doc.

529
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:24,630
打破一切常理 不需要专家
When you break all the laws of physics,

530
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:26,130
谁也知道要付出代价
you seriously think there won't be a price?

531
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:29,470
你害死一批  又想害死我们这一批
You already killed the last fucking crew.And now you want to kill us as well!

532
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:32,010
- 它只是一艘该死的船 - DJ
- It's just a fucking ship, all right? - D.J.!

533
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:35,180
你走火入魔了 这艘船只是一堆金属
It's just a ship, do you understand? It's just a big hunk of metal.

534
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:38,060
- 没有别的东西 - DJ
- There's nothing odd going on. - D.J.?

535
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,190
- 没事 - DJ
- Fine. - D.J.?

536
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:50,030
- 你没事吧?  - 没事 我只是...
- You all right? - Yeah, I'm just...

537
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,070
对不起
I'm sorry.

538
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,780
- 见鬼 - 史密夫
- Damn it! - Smitty.

539
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:55,990
- 没事了 - 操...
- It's all right. That's it. - Fucking...

540
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,580
这趟他妈的死定 你给我冷静下来 立刻
That's enough! I want you calm, I want you cool! Now!

541
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,170
回楼上去
- All right. - You're going back upstairs.

542
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,380
你和谷巴出去  ?
You're going outside on the Clark with Cooper,

543
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,880
把船修妥 不准出错
and you're going to repair the ship. No mistakes.

544
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,760
出错 没人能回去了 明白吗?
Mistakes, nobody goes home. Understood?

545
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,470
- 明白了 船长 - 那好
- Yes, sir. - All right.

546
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,890
- 船长 - 那就去吧
- Sir. - Get moving.

547
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,690
- 米勒 - 什么事?
- Miller. - What is it, Starck?

548
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:28,480
我分析了生命探测的读数
I ran the bio-scan with the DNA-RNA filters.

549
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:29,820
证明有生命
The results were bio readings...

550
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,530
但游离不定 这我知道
Of an indeterminate origin. Yes, I know.

551
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:34,360
你有没有中用的话可以说?
Don't you have anything useful to tell me, Lieutenant?

552
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:37,240
- 我有个理论 - 说来听听
- I've got a theory. - Let's hear it.

553
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:40,830
我认为这些数据和幻觉有关
I think that there's a connection between the readings and the hallucinations,

554
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:44,580
都是一种防御本能的反应
like they're all part of a defensive reaction,some sort of immune system.

555
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:46,250
我没空听这些话
I don't have time to listen to this.

556
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,790
- 你必须得听 - 为什么?
- You have to listen to me. - To what?

557
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,380
船对我们有反应而且越来越强
I'm saying that this ship is reacting to us and the reactions are getting stronger.

558
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:55,010
船似乎具有某种生命力
It's as if the ship brought back something with it,a life force of some kind.

559
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:57,720
你是指 这艘船是活的?
What are you telling me? That this ship is alive?

560
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,510
你要答案  我只有这个
You wanted an answer, and it's the only one I've got.

561
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,100
不 我要多活10个小时
No, what I want, Lieutenant, is to survive the next 10 hours.

562
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,230
泽斯汀
Justin?

563
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:57,700
泽斯汀
Justin!

564
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,130
你听到吗? 你听到吗?
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

565
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:52,500
- 什么? - 你听到什么?
- What's that? - What is it?

566
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,000
- 你听到了 - 你听到什么?
- You heard it. - What did you hear?

567
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:55,500
- 那是什么?  - 彼德丝  听着
- What is it? - Peters, listen to me.

568
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:56,880
我是DJ
It's D.J., all right?

569
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:58,970
我们什么都没有听到
I didn't hear anything. Neither of us heard anything.

570
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:00,340
- 冷静点 好吗 - 好的
- So just calm down, all right? - Okay.

571
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,430
- 调整一下呼吸 - 好的
- Get your breath back. - Okay.

572
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:04,640
- 现在 告诉我吧 - 我是...
- Now, tell me. - I was...

573
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,810
停下来! 停下来!
Make it stop! Make it stop!

574
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:14,770
开门
Open the door.

575
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:17,740
别这样!
Stop moving!

576
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:23,490
- 不! - 韦博士 别走
- No! - Weir, stop. Stop him!

577
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,450
你想怎样?
What're you doing?

578
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:32,620
韦博士 在目前情形下 自制很重要
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.

579
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,300
什么回事?
What is it?

580
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,010
前舱气锁
The forward airlock.

581
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,100
米勒 史密夫 谷巴 谁在气锁里?
Miller, Smith, Cooper, anyone in the airlock?

582
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,970
没有人
That's a negative, Starck.

583
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,850
泽斯汀
Justin.

584
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,310
- 泽斯汀 - 不要
- Justin. - Don't!

585
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,980
泽斯汀 不要
Justin, no!

586
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:58,940
泽斯汀 不要! 泽斯汀 打开门
Justin, no! Justin, open the door.

587
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:01,860
米勒 来这里
Miller, come in.

588
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:04,820
米勒 情况危急
Miiier, come in. We have an emergency.

589
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:06,780
什么事? 舒泰克
What's going on in there, Starck?

590
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:09,410
- 泽斯汀在气锁里 - 再说一遍
- Justin's in the airlock. - Say again.

591
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,370
泽斯汀在气锁里 没有穿气压衣
Justin is in the airlock and he is not wearing a suit.

592
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,830
- 该死 我过去 - 你继续
- Shit. I'm on it. - As you were, sailor.

593
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,460
- 别走开 我需要你帮忙 - 我必须去 你继续修理
- Skipper, you need me on this. - I need you right where you are.

594
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:19,380
他弄坏了内门开关
He's engaged the override.

595
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,510
- 你可以修复吗? - 我试试看
- Can you shut it down? - I'll try.

596
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:23,260
我去救他 舒泰克
Coming to him, Starck.

597
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:26,220
泽斯汀 立刻开门!
Justin! Open this door, now!

598
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:31,310
舒泰克 报告情况
Starck, give me status.

599
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:33,310
你快点
You better hurry. He's engaged the override

600
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,600
- 我们打不开内门 - 我要装备
- and we can't open the inner door. - I'll get the kit.

601
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:38,480
泽斯汀 开门
Justin, open the door!

602
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:46,030
泽斯汀 开门
Justin, open the door.

603
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,450
- 你听到吗?  - 继续跟他谈话
- Did you hear it? - Keep him talking.

604
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:51,950
听到 你知道那是什么吗?
Yes. Yes, I heard it. Do you know what it is?

605
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,040
它给东西你看
It shows you things,

606
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:57,380
- 恐怖的东西 - 它是什么?
- horrible things. - What does?

607
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:01,710
是从别处闯进我心里面的黑暗
The dark inside me from the other place.

608
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,970
- 我不要回去 - 不 熊宝宝
- I won't go back there. I won't. - No, Baby Bear.

609
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:06,800
- 来吧 打开门 - 怎么了?
- Come on, open the door. - What's happening?

610
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,140
- 我还没修复好 - 它很不错
- I don't think she can talk him down. - She'd better.

611
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,430
没法说服他开门 不然他死定
If he opens the airlock, he's going to turn inside out.

612
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,980
- 继续说服他 - 已经快了
- No. You stay with me. - Almost got it.

613
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:16,440
- 我快弄好了 - 泽斯汀和我们留在这里
- I've almost got it. - You stay with me, Justin.

614
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,150
快啊 快开门
Come on, now. Open that door!

615
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:21,650
你见到我所见的就不会阻止我
If you could see the things I've seen, you wouldn't try to stop me.

616
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:23,940
你现在只是神志不清
No, that's not you talking. That's not you talking.

617
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:26,070
对了 对了 就是那个
That's it. That's it, right there.

618
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,820
开门 按那个键 快
Open the door. Go for that button. Come on.

619
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:30,080
好的(外门  内门)
Okay.

620
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,080
不(外门开动)
No!

621
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,920
泽斯汀按了键 外门30秒之后开启
Captain, Justin just activated the door. It's on a 30-second delay.

622
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,090
泽斯汀!
Justin!

623
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,430
准备25秒后减压
Stand by for decompression in 25 seconds.

624
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:51,350
我在哪里?
Where am I?

625
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:53,600
- 嘿 - 舒泰克 开门
- Hey. - Starck, get it fucking open!

626
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,930
- 嘿 开门 - 不能
- Hey, open the door. - I can't.

627
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,520
外门一开 内门不能开
The inner door won't open when the outside door's been triggered.

628
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,690
- 否则整艘船会失压 - 天哪
- It'd decompress the entire ship. - Oh, my God.

629
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:02,610
熊妈妈 开门
Mama Bear, open the door.

630
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:04,400
快开门  求求你
Come on, please.

631
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:07,360
- 船长 - 让我跟他通话
- Captain! - Patch me through to him.

632
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,200
船长 叫他们开门
Captain Miller, tell them to open the door.

633
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,120
不可以 泽斯汀
They can't do that, Justin.

634
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,040
- 我不想死在这里 - 你不会死的
- I don't want to die in here. - You're not gonna die.

635
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:18,330
小心听着 我会救你
I want you to listen to me very carefully, and I'm gonna get you out of there.

636
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:22,920
老天
Oh, my God.

637
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:24,800
已经开始降压了
It's starting.

638
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,720
- 我的眼睛 - 别理会 闭上
- My eyes. - Don't think about them. Shut them.

639
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,970
尽量紧闭
Just shut them as tight as you can.

640
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:31,180
5秒
Five seconds.

641
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,560
蹲下来  把身体卷成一团
Tuck yourself into a crouch position. Make yourself into a ball now.

642
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,730
我不能呼吸 老天
I can't breathe. Ch, God.

643
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,230
老天 好辛苦
Oh, God, it hurts.

644
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:44,570
将肺里的气 尽量喷出来
I want you to huff and puff and blow all the air out of your lungs.

645
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:47,650
听到吗? 喷尽肺里的气 泽斯汀
Do you hear me? All the air out of your lungs, Justin.

646
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,990
立刻喷
Do it, now!

647
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,670
行了 熊宝宝
Okay, Baby Bear.

648
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:10,510
我抓到他了 大家准备
Got him. I got him. Stand by, people.

649
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:11,930
准备
Standby.

650
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:17,430
- 有气压了 - 泽斯汀 我们来了
- We've got pressure. - We're coming, Justin. We're coming.

651
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:22,650
腰部5处破裂 抱稳他的头
I'm going to need five units here. Hold his head still.

652
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,650
好的
Okay.

653
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:29,030
甘油 立刻拿来
Give me some more glycerin, now.

654
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:31,910
膈膜破裂 血压仍然下降
One thing at a time, iet's keep him breathing.Christ, he's bieeding out.

655
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:34,870
开始静脉滴注 15cc
Pressure's stiii dropping.Start the drip, 15 cc.

656
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:46,800
已经止住了血 情况总算稳定
I've stopped the bleeding, stabilized him best I can.

657
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:51,130
遍体鳞伤 但捡回条命
He won't be pretty, but he should live

658
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:54,050
- 假若可以回去... - 我们会回去
- if we make it back. - We'll make it.

659
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,890
舒泰克 我们还剩下多少时间?
Starck, what's our time like?

660
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:00,890
空气只可以维持4个小时
CO2 levels will become toxic in four hours.

661
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,890
好
All right.

662
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:05,730
彼德丝 查查上一班船员出了什么事
Peters, we've got to find out what happened to the other crew

663
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:08,480
以免重蹈覆辙
before the same thing happens to us.

664
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:12,820
我可以在指挥室研究航行日志 但不会回医疗室去
I can work on the log on the bridge, but I won't go back to Medical.

665
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:15,570
- 可以 - 我去查
- Fine. - Yes, sir.

666
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:20,200
泽斯汀提过
Justin said something about,

667
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:23,330
"我心里面的黑暗"
"the dark inside me."

668
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,250
什么意思?
What's that mean?

669
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:28,340
博士?
Doctor?

670
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:32,920
我认为没有什么意思
I don't think it means anything.

671
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,890
博士 不要走开就算
Don't you walk away from me, mister.

672
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,350
我要答案 博士
I'd like some answers, Doctor.

673
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,020
我有个船员想走出船外
I'd like to know why one of my men tried to commit suicide

674
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:50,280
企图自杀 我想知道那声音从何而来
by throwing himself out of an airlock. I'd like to know what caused that noise.

675
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,990
船身遇到温度变化
Look, thermal changes in the hull

676
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:56,990
冷缩热胀  产生震动
could've caused the metal to expand and contract rapidly,causing reverberations.This is possible.

677
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:01,120
废话! 你最清楚这艘船  却废话连篇
Bullshit! You built this fucking ship. You've given me nothing but bullshit.

678
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:03,460
你要我说什么?
What do you want me to say?

679
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:07,540
你说这船打开了一条通道
You said the ship's drive creates a gateway

680
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,290
- 是的 - 通去哪里的通道?
- Yeah. - To what?

681
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,510
- 我不知道 - 它去过哪里?
- I don't know. - Where did it go?

682
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:15,550
- 这艘船去过哪里?  - 我不知道
- Where did you send it? - I don't know.

683
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,050
七年来 船去过哪里?
Where has it been for the last seven years?

684
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:19,220
我不知道
Look, I don't know.

685
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:21,390
"我不知道"不是一个好的回答
"I don't know," is not good enough, Doctor.

686
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:23,350
你身为专家
You're supposed to be the fucking expert.

687
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:25,560
有责任提供答案
I need answers. That's your job.

688
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:29,480
- 所谓别处 即是哪处?  - 我不知道 我不知道
- Now, the other place, where is that? - I don't know! I don't know!

689
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,400
你看
Look,

690
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:34,190
这艘船有很多经历
there's a lot of things happening around here

691
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:37,740
我都不清楚 我需要时间去了解
that I don't fully understand. I need time.

692
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,330
我明白了
I see.

693
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:44,160
时间 我们刚好没有
Well, that's exactly what we don't have, Doctor.

694
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,670
船长!
Captain!

695
00:56:56,930 --> 00:57:06,600
别把我留在这里
Don't ieave me!

696
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,320
求求你
Piease!

697
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:20,490
看在上帝的份上 救救我!
For God's sakes, help me!

698
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:32,290
我的幻觉
It's in your head.

699
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,880
只是幻觉
It's just in your head.

700
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,200
上帝开恩
God help us.

701
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:06,330
我真真切切的听见
I'm telling you, it was his voice I heard.

702
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:10,250
有人明明在呼唤我 一个叫做高利的年轻船员
He was calling to me. A young bosun named Eddie Corrick.

703
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,670
他跟我一同在巨人号服役
We served on the Goliath together.

704
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:20,180
遇上氧气缸爆裂  船内起火
When the O2 tanks ruptured, four of us made it to the lifeboat.

705
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:24,680
我和其他3人 逃上救生船 但高利赶不及
But Corrick was still on board the Goliath when the fire broke out.

706
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:27,600
见到无重状态的火焰吗?
You ever seen fire in zero gravity?

707
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,100
好灿烂
It's beautiful.

708
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:35,020
火焰水银泻地
It's like liquid.

709
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:38,440
四处流出
It slides all over everything.

710
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:41,360
像波涛那样
Comes up in waves.

711
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:45,410
一浪接一浪
And they just kept hitting him,

712
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:47,450
不断向高利烧去
wave after wave.

713
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:52,290
高利向我呼救
He was screaming for me to save him.

714
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:54,960
你怎样做?
What did you do?

715
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:57,800
做唯一可以做的事情
I did the only thing I could.

716
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,220
我关上救生船的门 留下了他
I closed the lifeboat hatch, and I left him behind.

717
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:09,810
从此 我发誓不再放弃任何人
I swore I'd never lose another man.

718
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,270
我认识你很久
I've known you a long time.

719
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:18,150
- 你从来没有提到过 - 这才奇怪 我从来没有向别人提起过
- You never told me that. - That's just it, D.J., I never told anybody.

720
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:21,820
这艘船却知道
But this ship knew about it.

721
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:26,240
看透我的恐惧 我的秘密
It knows my fears. It knows my secrets.

722
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:30,290
进入我的脑海 向我展示
Gets inside your head, and it shows you.

723
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:34,170
我本来不打算告诉你
I wasn't going to tell you this.

724
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:39,170
反复听那求救讯号之后
I've been listening to the distress signal.

725
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:40,840
我...
And I...

726
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:45,930
我发觉原来我翻译错了
I think I made a mistake in the translation.

727
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:55,940
怎样
Go on.

728
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:59,520
我以为讯号是"释吾"
I thought it said "liberate me."

729
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,610
救我
Save me.

730
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:04,650
但不是"我"
But it's not "me."

731
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:08,200
是"释汝"
It's "iiberate tutume."

732
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:10,830
救你自己
Save yourself.

733
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,460
而且越说越不妙
And it gets worse.

734
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:18,380
这段
There.

735
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:21,050
我认为
I think,

736
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,970
应该是"脱冥"
that says "ex inferis."

737
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:28,140
救你自己
"Save yourself,

738
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,890
脱离地狱
"from hell."

739
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,900
瞧 如果韦博士没有说错
Look, if what Dr. Weir tells us is true,

740
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,230
这艘船一度走出我们的宇宙
this ship has been beyond the boundaries of our universe

741
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,570
一度离开科学的境界
of known scientific reality.

742
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:48,240
天晓得它去到哪里
Who knows where it's been,

743
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,410
见过什么
what it's seen,

744
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:54,910
带回来了什么
and what it's brought back with it.

745
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:56,620
到过地狱
From hell.

746
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:04,090
你不相信有地狱吧?
You don't believe in that kind of stuff, do you?

747
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:10,300
发讯号的人必定相信
Whoever sent that message, he sure believes in hell.

748
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:12,850
米勒船长
Captain Miller.

749
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:19,060
谷巴 我希望是好消息
Whatever it is, Coop, it better be good.

750
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:20,230
是的
Yes, sir.

751
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:23,070
-侠侣号可以再加压
Ready to repressurize the Clark and get the heii out of here.

752
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:24,570
启航 我去了
On my way.

753
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,450
小乖乖  别教我失望
Come on, baby, don't let me down.

754
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:42,210
小乖乖  爹爹回来了
Hello, baby. Papa's home.

755
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,380
希望接口支撑得住
She's holding.

756
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:46,840
糟糕
Oh, shit.

757
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,840
船长 船身仍有点漏气
Skipper, we're still venting trace gasses.

758
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:52,010
20分钟之内我可以填补好
Give me about 20 minutes to plug the hole.

759
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:56,850
谷巴先生 你是救星 20分钟后 我们启程
Cooper, you are the iifesaver. 20 minutes and we're underway.

760
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,730
倒霉
Shit.

761
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:08,780
- 有没有咖啡? - 有 是冷的
- Got any coffee? - Yeah, but it's cold.

762
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:10,110
好极
Great.

763
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:21,670
舒泰克
Starck.

764
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:28,260
米勒?
Miller?

765
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:41,040
释汝  脱冥

766
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,530
我们走
We're leaving.

767
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:55,450
不能走
No, we can't leave.

768
01:02:56,830 --> 01:02:58,540
总署有命令
Our orders are specific.

769
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,500
命令是: 拯救船员 打捞机件
Rescue the crew, salvage what's left of the ship.

770
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:04,540
船员都给你的船杀个精光 韦博士
The crew is dead, Doctor. Your ship killed them.

771
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:07,840
- 我们有任务要执行 - 现在放弃任务 博士
- We came here to do a job. - We're aborting, Doctor!

772
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:11,800
舒泰克 下载新领域号的电脑档案
Starck, download the files from the Event Horizon's computers.

773
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:15,470
DJ 准备将泽斯汀搬上侠侣号
D.J., I want you to get Justin prepped and ready to move him back to the Clark.

774
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:18,010
医疗室有些东西我要去拿
There's stuff I wanna get from medical. We'd better move him in the tank.

775
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,770
没问题 去拿吧
No problem. Do it.

776
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:22,890
- 彼德丝 - 长官
- Peters. - Yes, sir.

777
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,100
将二氧化碳清除器搬回侠侣号
I want you to get the CO2 scrubbers back into the Clark.

778
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:27,320
- 和史密夫一起 - 嗯
- Take Smitty with you. - Right.

779
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,820
船长
Captain.

780
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:37,280
- 不要这样 - 已经决定了
- Don't do this. - It's done.

781
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:40,950
我的船呢?  怎可以不理?
What about my ship? You can't just leave her.

782
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,710
我不会不理
I have no intention of leaving her, Doctor.

783
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:44,790
我会将侠侣号驶远一点
I will take the Lewis & Clark to a safe distance,

784
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,420
然后发飞弹 向新领域号猛轰
and then I will launch tac missiles atthe Event Horizon,

785
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:51,090
把它轰个稀巴烂  永不超生
until I'm satisfied she's vaporized. Fuck this ship.

786
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:02,230
船长 生命探测器读数在狂升
Captain Miller, the bio-scan just went off the scale.

787
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:06,190
核心似乎从船的其它部分吸收着动力
It looks like the core is draining power from the rest of the ship.

788
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:09,150
下载档案 撤离本船
Get the files. Vacate. I want off this ship.

789
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:12,690
你不可能撤离 它不准你走
You can't leave. She won't let you.

790
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:15,410
登上侠侣号 否则你就要
You just get your gear and get back on the Lewis & Clark Doctor,

791
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:17,570
走路回家 韦博士
or you'll find yourself walking home.

792
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:19,530
我已经回家了
I am home.

793
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,450
我们走吧
Let's go!

794
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,200
准备
Ready?

795
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,750
没用了
Shot.

796
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,170
快点
Come on.

797
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:30,800
- 准备 - 没用了
- Ready? - Shot.

798
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:37,680
- 没用了 - 好吧
- Shot. - Okay.

799
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:40,390
走吧 这地方令人心寒
Peters, can we go? This place is really freaking me out.

800
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:42,100
即使回家也要呼吸啊
Yeah, you wanna breathe on the way home.

801
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:44,390
- 够了 我们走 - 该死

804
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,610
好了 现在走人
Come on! Got it!

805
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:17,340
噢 不 彼德丝
Oh, no. Peters.

806
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:25,050
天啊!
Oh, God.

807
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,020
比利
Billy.

808
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:43,400
克莱尔
Claire?

809
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:51,950
克莱尔
Claire.

810
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:55,290
是我 我回来了
It's me. I'm home.

811
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,340
我回来了
I'm home.

812
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:06,260
你需要我的时候我不在
I know I wasn't there when you needed me,

813
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:09,180
对不起 ...
and I'm sorry I...

814
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:13,060
因为工作 忽略了你
I let my work come between us.

815
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:19,270
克莱尔 不要
God, Claire, no.

816
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:23,780
求求你 不要
I'm begging you, please. Please, don't.

817
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:25,860
不要再一次  求求你
Not again, please.

818
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:35,580
我一直都 ...
I've been so...

819
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:39,420
比利
Billy.

820
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:41,750
没关系
It's all right.

821
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:48,300
- 我多么寂寞 - 你不再寂寞了
- I've been so alone. - You'll never be alone again.

822
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:53,470
从此陪着我 跟着我
You're with me now. You're with me

823
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:58,350
我有很多美妙的东西
and I have such wonderful, wonderful things

824
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,980
给你看
to show you.

825
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,880
我是个高手
Damn, I'm good.

826
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:27,930
谷巴 还有多久才修妥?
Coop. Coop, how long are you going to take?

827
01:09:28,090 --> 01:09:29,640
我好想起程
'Cause i've got to get the hell out of here.

828
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:32,390
不由你不佩服 修妥了
Look, you can kiss my ass, Smith, 'cause I'm done.

829
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:34,720
收拾好工具
Just give me a second to collect my tools

830
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:36,140
我们就此走佬
and we can get out of Dodge.

831
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:38,390
- 顶多两分钟 - 知道
- Two minutes tops. - Roger that.

832
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:45,530
韦博士
Weir.

833
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:47,400
韦博士
Dr. Weir.

834
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:53,580
韦博士
Weir!

835
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:57,750
韦博士 立刻回来
Dr. Weir, get your ass back on board now!

836
01:09:57,830 --> 01:09:59,460
韦博士
Weir!

837
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:01,630
考
Shit.

838
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:04,460
米勒船长 米勒船长 听到吗?
Captain Miller, Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.

839
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,260
米勒船长 米勒船长 听到吗?
Captain Miiier. Captain Miiier, do you copy? Over.

840
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:08,470
说吧  史密夫
Go ahead, Smitty.

841
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:11,510
韦博士在侠侣号内做了手脚
I've just seen Weir messing around on the Clark sir.

842
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:16,220
等一等  我先检查一下
Stand by, Smitty, I wanna check something out.

843
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:24,230
- 史密夫 快走开 - 发生了什么事? 船长
- Smith, get out of there. - Come again, sir?

844
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,230
炸弹失踪
One of the expiosives is missing from the corridor.

845
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,740
- 韦想炸毁侠侣号 - 这怎么行?
- Weir might have put it on the Clark. - No. No way.

846
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:31,450
不行 好不容易才修妥
No, sir, no way. I've just put it back together, sir.

847
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:33,870
立刻离开侠侣号 史密夫
Get off the Clark now, Smith!

848
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,040
操他娘的
Where the fucking hell are you?

849
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:09,190
找到了
Got you.

850
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,240
阿什 等一等 我来了
Hang on, Smitty. I'm coming!

851
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:26,250
不
No!

852
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:35,970
妈的
Shit!

853
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:20,180
他奶奶的
Where the fuck am I going?

854
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:23,270
怎么这么倒霉?
Why does this shit got to happen to me? Fuck.

855
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:27,560
谷巴 开动脑筋
All right, think, Coop. Think. Think.

856
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:31,730
老子怎么回到船上去
All right, I got to get back to the ship. I got to get back to the ship, all right.

857
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:35,360
把气放了 把气放了
I gotta blow my air tank. I'll blow my air tank.

858
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,200
他妈的
All right. Fuck.

859
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:41,450
把你的气筒放气  这个方法最好行得通
This better work. This shit better work. All right.

860
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:45,660
我会回去的  一 二 三 去啊! 行了
Here I go. All right. One, two, three. Come on.

861
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:49,290

Come on. Yes!

862
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:53,210
我来也  狗杂种
Here I come, motherfuckers!

863
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:01,180
DJ呢
D.J.

864
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:04,520
- 发生什么事了? - 侠侣号毁了
- What was that? - Clark's gone.

865
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:08,350
- 阿什 谷巴殉职 - 什么....
- Smitty and Cooper are dead. - What? What the...

866
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,480
是韦干的 碰到他 格杀勿论
it was Weir. You spot him, you take him out.

867
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,230
明白
Understood.

868
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:16,820
- 小心  DJ - 放心好了
- Be carefui, D.J. - Don't worry about Weir.

869
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:19,700
我会对付韦
I'll take care of him.

870
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:30,880
DJ在吗?
D.J.?

871
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:46,770
DJ 回答
D.J.? D.J., answer me!

872
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:28,440
(船身修补)

873
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:36,730
好 韦博士
Okay, Dr. Weir.

874
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:43,570
你舍不得离开你的船?
You don't wanna leave your ship?

875
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:46,080
你永远也不用离开
You never will.

876
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:46,180
舒泰克
Starck.

877
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:10,040
不要怕
It's okay.

878
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:16,330
我扶你走
I'm gonna get you out of here.

879
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:20,550
好的
Okay.

880
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,220
放松
Easy.

881
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:43,780
老天
Oh, my God.

882
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:47,530
你的眼睛咋了?
What happened to your eyes?

883
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:51,450
我们要去的地方  用不着眼睛
Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.

884
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,450
你到底在说什么?
What are you talking about?

885
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:57,460
我制造新领域号 去探索星球
I created the Event Horizon to reach the stars.

886
01:16:58,250 --> 01:17:01,550
但新领域号去得更远 更远
But she's gone much, much further than that.

887
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:05,380
在我们的宇宙冲开了一个缺口
She tore a hole in our universe,

888
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:09,050
一条通道 通往另一个世界
a gateway to another dimension.

889
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:12,100
一个彻底的乱世
A dimension of pure chaos,

890
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:15,390
一个彻底的凶域
pure evil.

891
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:19,360
新领域号出发时  只是一艘船
When she crossed over, she was just a ship.

892
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,570
但回来时
But when she came back,

893
01:17:22,570 --> 01:17:25,070
是活生生的
she was alive.

894
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,110
看它吧! 米勒
Look at her, Miller.

895
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:32,450
多么壮丽
Isn't she beautiful?

896
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:36,910
你这壮丽的船 杀光它的船员 博士
Your beautiful ship killed its crew, Doctor.

897
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:39,250
喔
Well,

898
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:43,130
杀光一批 有另一批
now she has another crew.

899
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,300
现在有我们
Now she has us.

900
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:57,020
你在干什么? 博士
What do you think you're doing, Doctor?

901
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:00,270
你想知道船去过什么地方?
You wanted to know where the ship has been,

902
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:02,980
现在你就知道
so now you'll find out.

903
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:21,210
- 你射不中我 就会射穿船身 - 你凭什么以为我射不中?
- If you miss me, you blow out the hull. - What makes you think I'll miss?

904
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,500
我回来了 犀利
That's right, I'm back!

905
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:27,380
我...该死 我不能.. 嘿
I'm... Shit, I can't stop. Hey!

906
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:29,470
嘿 操
Hey! Fuck.

907
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:34,350
搞什么鬼? 该死
What? Who the fuck? Oh, shit!

908
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,400
米勒 米勒
Miller! Miller!

909
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,920
伸手过来
Give me your hand!

910
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:38,260
- 快点 - 我不能够
- Come on! - I can't!

911
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:41,930
我不会撇下你
I'm not leaving you.

912
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:03,620
前舱气锁
Forward airlock.

913
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:10,590
不可能是韦
It can't be Weir.

914
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:13,800
绝对不能大意
I'm not taking any chances.

915
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:16,300
也许是他回来了
You watch your back.

916
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:29,270
- 不 不要打我 - 谷巴
- Yo! Don't hit me. - Cooper!

917
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:32,150
帮我脱掉  帮我脱掉
Take it off! Take it off!

918
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,240
- 烤死我了 - 好了 好了
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe. - You're okay.

919
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:38,990
- 你没事了 麻烦总算过去 - 还没有
- You're okay. It's over. - No, it's not.

920
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:42,370
引力推进器开动了 必须关闭
Weir's activated the gravity drive. We got to shut it down.

921
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:44,450
- 怎样关闭? 控制室已经被锁 - 机房呢?
- How? The bridge is gone. - What about Engineering?

922
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:45,790
你可以去机房关闭吗?
You think you can shut it down from there?

923
01:21:45,870 --> 01:21:48,370
我不懂程序 只有韦博士是专家  但 ...
I don't know the process. Dr. Weir was the expert.

924
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:50,420
我宁死也不愿意去那个世界
I don't want to go where the other crew went, okay?I'd rather be dead.

925
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:51,790
好
Okay.

926
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:54,250
- 我们就炸掉这杂种 - 炸掉?
- Okay, we blow the fucker up. - We blow it up?

927
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:57,510
韦说过 ...把主廊炸掉
Do like Weir said. Blow the corridor,

928
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:02,260
船头船尾一分为二 我们坐船头逃生
separate us from the rest of ship. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat.

929
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:04,930
开动求救讯号
With any luck, TDRS will pick up our emergency beacon.

930
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:07,310
然后躺在引力缸
We prep the gravity couches, put ourselves in stasis,

931
01:22:07,390 --> 01:22:09,140
等候救援
and stand by for a search and rescue team.

932
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:11,610
我立刻去启动爆炸装置
Meantime, I'm gonna go manually arm these explosives.

933
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:13,900
- 行得通吗?  - 韦说过行得通的
- Skipper, will this shit work? - It worked for Dr. Weir.

934
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:16,280
你开动求救讯号之后  立刻回来
You go activate the emergency beacon. You get back here double-quick.

935
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,150
- 遵命 - 我跟你去
- Yes, sir. - I'll come with you.

936
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,320
你留在这里  准备引力缸
You stay here. You prep the gravity couches.

937
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:21,490
米勒
Miller.

938
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:26,040
我出去之后 你关上门
Close this door behind me, Lieutenant.
