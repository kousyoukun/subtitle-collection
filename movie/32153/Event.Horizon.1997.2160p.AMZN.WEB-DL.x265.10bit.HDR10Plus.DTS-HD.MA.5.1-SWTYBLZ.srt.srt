00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,540
取消假期
We were taken off a well-deserved leave

U.S.A.C. Intercepted a radio transmission

10
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,940
l自海王星的上空
from a decaying orbit around Neptune.

11
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,610
查C  碜 ...
The source of this transmission has been identified

12
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,620
新I域
as the Event Horizon.

13
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,040
呵 吹牛
Yeah

14
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,290

他f下去
Let the man speak.

18
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,380
我曾ν夤布 新I域
What was made public aboutthe Event Horizon

19
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,890
在探索外太空r
that she was a deep space research vessel

20
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:58,060
因榉t荷^度所以炸
that her reactor went critical

21
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,730
其并非如此
none of that is true.

22
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,230
新I域是政府秘制的太空船
The Event Horizon was the culmination of a secret government project

23
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,820
目的是要w得超^光速
to create a spacecraft capable of faster-than-light flight.

24
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,990
恕我插嘴 那不可能 根相φ
I don't... Excuse me. See

25
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,820
]有|西快^光速
The law of relativity prohibits faster-than-light travel.

26
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,080
  我不可以`背相φ
Relativity

27
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,500
但可以避重就p
We can go around it.

28
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,580
那艘船不能快^光速
The ship doesn't really go faster than light.

29
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,670
但能虼蜷_一lr空通道
What it does is it creates a dimensional gateway

30
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,840
能x那g  在宇宙中
that allows it to jump instantaneously

31
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,340
囊惶到好多光年之外的另一
from one point of the universe to another light years away.

32
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,670
怎尤?
How?

33
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,890
- 要用碗s的W才能解 - 不妨一
- Well

34
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,890
碚f
Right

35
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,600
我采用醮
we use a rotating magnetic field

36
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,940
⒁恍∈引力子集中起
to focus a narrow beam of gravitons. These in turn fold space-time

37
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,110
然后  按照S氏力W把r空折B
consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics

38
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,950
直到r空曲率成o限大
until the space-time curvature becomes infinitely large

39
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,530
亩a生一奇c
and you produce a singularity. Now

40
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,370
f通俗c
Layman's terms.

41
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,410
他的  f通俗c 你能不能使用人懂的Z言?
Fuck layman's terms. Do you speak English?

42
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,540
假O@...

那是云尼莎的海  是我的
Excuse me. That's Vanessa

44
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,920
@幅美女代表r空
Attractive piece of paper represents space-time

45
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:19,180
你要倪@一cA到那一cB去
and you want to get from point "A" here to "B" there.

46
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,350
牲c之g最短的距x是什么?
Now

47
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,890
B一l段
A straight line.

48
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,730
e
Wrong.

49
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,770
牲c之g最短的距x榱
The shortest distance between two points is zero.

50
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,980
r空通道的作用就是
And that's what the gateway does.

51
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,940
除非通道打_了
Mr. Cooper

52
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,820
-  通道的_打_了 - 引力推M器]有l
- That's it. The gateway was open. - The gateway couldn't be open

53
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,320
怎打_?
because the gravity drive wasn't activated.

54
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,200
我只是照直f
Look

55
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,620
- 推M器不能自己l - 你f^火了 谷巴
- It can't just start up by itself. - Mr. Cooper

58
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,170

Mr. Cooper says he saw something. I believe he saw something.

59
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,300
我需要解
I need an explanation.

60
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:12,020
恕我老f句  我J楣劝拖壬眼花
In my view

61
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,440
也S他到的是引力歪曲
But maybe he saw an optical effect

62
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,350
所a生的X效
caused by gravitational distortion.

63
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,520
X效? 他的L鲈
"An optical effect"? That's fucking poetic.

64
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,480
- L鲈... - 谷巴!
- Where the fuck... - Cooper!

65
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,690
行  我住口
I'm sorry. All right.

66
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,950
引力歪曲  怎影l生?
Gravitational distortion. What could create that

67
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:33,450
如果核心漏出一的引力浪
If

68
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:38,460
@引力浪造成r空歪曲 令伤雇∷坪跸失
it could distort space-time. It could make Justin seem to disappear.

69
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:42,000
也pbH
It could also have damaged the Lewis & Clark.

70
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:47,630
- 但我J橥耆]有可能 - 核心扔惺裁?
- However

71
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,890
相碗s
It's complicated.

72
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,720
多久可以解清楚? 我有 ...
How much time do you need? We have

73
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,310
17小r48分
17 hours and 48 minutes.

74
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,350
核心扔惺裁?
What's in the core?

75
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,820
@就是通道
This is the gateway.

76
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,780
那三磁h排列好
Now

77
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,110
形成一人造黑洞
it creates an artificial black hole

78
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,910
船就可以去太空任何地c
which allows the ship to travel to any point in space.

79
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:14,790
黑洞  宇宙最大的力
A black hole

80
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,750
- 而你制造出 - _ 是的
- And you've created one? - Absolutely

81
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:22,920
我\用那巨大的力量去扭曲r空
Because we can use that immense power to bend space-time.

82
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,590
瞧  bH要一千年
Look

新I域朝l夕至
Butthe Event Horizon could be there in a day.

85
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:34,720
- 行得通的 - 下戆 很安全
- If it worked. - You can come down. It's perfectly safe.

86
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,400
那么  伤雇∪绻被吸入通道
So

he could've gone wherever the Event Horizon's been.

88
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,530
在理上是的  但正如我f的
Theoretically

89
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:52,490
- 通道不可能自哟蜷_ - 我明白

You're going outside on the Clark with Cooper

534

把船修妥 不食鲥e

I think that there's a connection between the readings and the hallucinations

545
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:02,580
都是一N防御本能的反

船ξ有反而且越碓
I'm saying that this ship is reacting to us and the reactions are getting stronger.

549
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:13,010
船似乎具有某N生命力
It's as if the ship brought back something with it

550
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,720
你是指 @艘船是活的?
