Doctor, if you'll just follow

Mr Cooper,

or you'll find yourself walking
to Neptune.

- Hats off in the tank.
- Sir.

00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,426
- First time in a grav couch?
- Yeah.

00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,719
Uh-huh.

47
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,639
I think your captain
has some kind of a problem with me.

48
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,933
Oh, well. Don't worry about him.

49
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,436
He just loves having complete strangers
on his ship.

50

- D.J.
- Yeah.

No.

Is this necessary?

53

This is my XO, Lieutenant Starck.

113
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,419
Mr Justin, Engineering.

114
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,171
The funky spaceman over here
is Mr Cooper.

115
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,465
What exactly is it you do
on board this ship, Coop?

116
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,218
Listen up, Doc,
I'm your best friend, okay?

117
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,678
I am the lifesaver and the heartbreaker.

118
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,597
He's a rescue technician.

119
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:31,768
This is Peters, medical technician.
And my pilot, Mr Smith.

120
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,396

123
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,569
All right, all right.

124
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,781
Now we all know each other.
Skipper, I got a question.

125
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,825
What the fuck
are we doing way out here?

126
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,411
Perhaps the good doctor
will be kind enough to tell us.

127
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,121
Thank you.

128
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,999
First of all,
I want to say how much I appreciate

129
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,377
- this opportunity to join you on what I...
- It's for sure

130
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,839
that you appreciate being here, Doctor,
but you must understand that we don't.

131
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,715
We were taken off
a well-deserved leave

132
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,342
and sent into Neptune space.

133
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,929
We are now three billion klicks
from the nearest outpost.

134
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,850
The last time U.S.A.C. attempted
a rescue this far past the outer reach,

135
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,186
well, we lost both ships.
So, if you please...

136
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,188
Right. Well...

137
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,985
Everything I'm about to tell you
is considered Code Black by the NSA.

138
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,279
U.S.A.C. intercepted
a radio transmission

139
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,115
from a decaying orbit around Neptune.

140
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:31,786
The source of this transmission
has been identified

141
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,788
<i>as the Event Horizon.</i>

142
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,209
Yeah, well, that's bullshit, for starters.

143
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,462
- Skipper, you took me off leave...
- Thank you so much.

144
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,339
Smitty, sit down.

145
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,176
Cooper, as you were.

146
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,554
Let the man speak.

147
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,556
What was made public
about the Event Horizon,

148
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,058
that she was a deep space
research vessel,

149
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:58,229
that her reactor went critical,
and that the ship blew up,

150
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,898
none of that is true.

151
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,401
The Event Horizon was the culmination
of a secret government project

152
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,988
to create a spacecraft
capable of faster-than-light flight.

153
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,158
I don't... Excuse me.
See, you can't actually do that.

154
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,995
The law of relativity
prohibits faster-than-light travel.

155
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:18,249
Relativity, yes.
We can't break the law of relativity.

156
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,668
We can go around it.

157
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,754
The ship doesn't really go faster
than light.

158
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,840
What it does is
it creates a dimensional gateway

159
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,009
that allows it to jump instantaneously

160
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,511
from one point of the universe
to another light years away.

161
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,846
How?

162
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:36,059
- Well, it's difficult to... It's all math.
- Try us, Doctor.

163
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,063
Right, well, using layman's terms,

164
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,774
we use a rotating magnetic field

165
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:47,111
to focus a narrow beam of gravitons.
These in turn fold space-time,

166
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,280
consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics,

167
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,116
until the space-time curvature
becomes infinitely large

168
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,702
and you produce a singularity.
Now, the singularity...

169
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,537
Layman's terms.

170
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,582
Fuck layman's terms.
Do you speak English?

171
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,714
Imagine, for a minute,
that this piece of paper...

172
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,218
Excuse me.
That's Vanessa, and that's mine.

173
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,096
Attractive piece of paper
represents space-time

174
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:17,433
and you want to get from
point "A" here

175
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,352
to "B" there.

176
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,522
Now, what's the shortest distance
between two points?

177
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,065
A straight line.

178
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,900
Wrong.

179
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,945
The shortest distance
between two points is zero.

180
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,155
And that's what the gateway does.

181
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,659
It folds space.

182
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:39,497
So that point "A" and point "B" co-exist
in the same space and time.

183
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:44,544
When the spacecraft passes
through the gateway,

184
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,671
space returns to normal.

185
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,424
It's called a gravity drive.

186
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,970
- How do you know all this?
- I built it.

187
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,597
Well, I can see why they sent you.

188
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,392
So if the ship didn't blow up,
then what happened?

189
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:03,521
Well, the mission was going perfectly,
like a textbook.

190
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,107
They reached safe distance
using conventional thrusters.

191
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,067
All systems looked good.

192
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,111
They had the go-ahead to use
the gravity drive

193
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,864
to open the gateway
to Proxima Centauri

194
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,325
and then, they just disappeared.

195
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,246
Vanished without a trace, until now.

196
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,332
Where's she been
for the last seven years, Doctor?

197
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,461
That's what we're here to find out.

198
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,797
Now, we've been unable
to verify life contact,

199
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,510
but TDRS did receive
this single transmission.

- What the fucking hell is that?
- Listen to this.

203
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:51,319
Houston passed the same recording
through several filters,

204
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:55,531
managed to isolate what appears to be
a human voice.

205
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,493
<i>(INCOMPREHENSIBLE</i>
<i>STATICKY VOICE)</i>

206
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,958
I'm not even sure
if it qualifies as language.

207
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,086
- Latin.
- What?

208
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,339
I mean, I think it sounds like Latin.

209
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,175
- Can you translate it?
- Play it again.

210
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,848
Right there. You hear that?

211
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:28,106
Sounds like, "Liberate me,"
something or other.

212
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,232
I can't make out the rest.

<i>"Liberate me?"</i>

<i>(BUZZER SOUNDING)</i>

216
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,074
All right. Stations, people.

217
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,883
Crossing the Horizon.
Optimum approach angle is 14 degrees.

218
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,470
- Come around to 334.
- Heading 334, sir.

219
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,306
Make your approach vector negative,
14 degrees.

220
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,558
1 -4 degrees.

221
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,606
We have lock on Event Horizon's
navigation beacon.

222
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,859
She's in the upper ionosphere

223
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:16,112
and it looks like we're in
for some very heavy chop, sir.

224
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,785
- Bring us in nice and tight, Mr Smith.
- Sir.

225
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,706
- Mr Justin, how's my ship?
- Smooth sailing, sir.

226
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,916
Matching speed on my mark.

227
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:33,379
Three, two, one. Mark.

228
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,428
- Range?
- 10,000 metres and closing, sir.

229
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,596
- Starck.
- Yes, sir.

230
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,598
Get on the horn.
See if anybody is listening.

231
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,683
This is the US Aerospace
command vessel

232
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:49,770
Lewis & Clark hailing Event Horizon.
Event Horizon, do you read?

233
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,147
Dr Weir.

234
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,776
- I think you'll want to see this.
- Where is she?

235
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,820
Dead ahead. 5,000 metres!

236
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,032
- Starck? Anybody home?
- Event Horizon, do you read?

237
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,159
3,000 metres and closing!

238
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,915
I can't see a thing.

239
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,667
1,500 metres, sir.
We're getting too close.

240
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,879
- Where is it?
- The scope is lit. It's right in front of us.

241
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,548
- 1,000 metres.
- Proximity warning!

242
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:21,302
900, 800, 700.

243
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,930
- We're right on top of her, sir!
- We're gonna hit.

244
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,807
- Starck!
- It's right there! God!

245
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,811
Reverse thrusters. Full!

246
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,576
There she is.

247
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,181
Jesus.

248
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,393
Very impressive ship, Doctor.

249
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,522
- Thank you.
- Mr Smith, are you up for a flyby?

250
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,941
Yes, sir. Yes, I'd love to.

251
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,208
That's the main airlock,
we can dock in there.

252
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,127
All right, Smith.

253
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,714
Use the arm and lock us
onto that small antenna cluster.

254
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,933
We should go very carefully here.
That's not a load-bearing structure.

255
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,770
Is now, Doctor.

256
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,860
- Everything five by five?
- Locked in to the Event Horizon.

257
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,070
Thank you, Smitty.
Light them if you got them.

258
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,406
Thank you very much, sir.

259
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,744
- Starck, give me a read.
- The reactor's still hot.

260
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,038
We've got several
small radiation sources,

261
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,165
but no leaks.
Probably it's nothing serious.

262
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,750
- Do they have pressure?
- Affirmative.

263
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:20,588
The hull's intact, but there's no gravity,
and the thermal units are off-line.

264
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,381
I'm showing deep cold.

265
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,759
The crew couldn't survive
unless they were in stasis.

266
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,136
- Find them, Starck.
- Yeah, I'm already on it, Captain.

267
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,888
Bio-scan on the line.

268
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,517
There's something wrong with the scan.

269
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,729
- Is it radiation interference?
- There's not enough to throw it off.

270
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:40,691
I'm picking up trace life forms,
but I can't get a lock on their location.

271
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,652
These readings are all over the ship.
It doesn't make any sense.

272
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:47,156
Okay, we do it the hard way.
Deck by deck, room by room.

273
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,866
Starck, deploy the umbilicus.

274
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,826
Smitty, fire up the boards
in the war room.

275
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,661
Sir.

276
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,872
Mr Justin,
I believe you're up for a walk?

277
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,332
Yes, sir.

278
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,380
Doctor, I'm gonna need you here
on the bridge.

279
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,798
Captain,

280
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,384
I didn't come out all this way
just to sit on your bridge.

281
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,719
- I need to be on that ship.
- Once we've secured the ship,

282
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,721
- we'll bring you on board.
- No, I'm sorry, that's unacceptable.

283
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,349
- I need to be on that ship.
- Once we've secured the ship.

284
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,600
That's the way it is.

285
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,477
I need you to guide us
from the com station.

286
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,605
This is where I need you.
Help us do our job.

287
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,955
(EXCLAIMS) Honey, honey,
you forgot your briefcase.

288
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,759
Stand clear.

289
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:54,306
- Anything gets funky, Cooper...
- I'll be on it.

290
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:59,103
Yo, Baby Bear, keep your nose clean.

291
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,195
D.J., showtime.

292
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,616
Video feed is clear.

293
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:16,287
- Are you with us, Dr Weir?
- Yes, I'm with you.

294
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,789
We are crossing the umbilicus,

295
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,792
making our approach
<i>to the Event Horizon.</i>

296
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,505
You're at the outer airlock door.

297
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,675
Magnetic boots on.

298
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,224
We've got pressure.

299
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,871
Place is a deep freeze.

300
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,584
We got ice crystals everywhere.

301
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,171
That's the central corridor
that you're in now.

302
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,840
It connects the personnel areas
at the front of the ship

303
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,509
to Engineering at the rear.

304
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,430
- Mr Justin, you take Engineering.
- Yes, sir.

305
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:19,517
Peters and I'll take the forward decks.

306
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,445
Doctor, what are these?

307
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:35,866
Yeah, I've got another one over here.
They are all over the place.

308
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,034
In an emergency,

309
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:40,621
they destroy the central corridor
and split the ship in half

310
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,792
and then the crew can use
the foredecks as a lifeboat.

311
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:54,051
CAPTAIN: I'm in Medical. No casualties.

312
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,307
Place looks like it's never been used.

<i>WEIR: You still haven't seen any crew?</i>

314
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,937
If we saw any crew, Doctor,
you'd know it by now.

315
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,315
Scanning for life readings.

316
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,654
This place is a tomb.

317
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,284
Fuck me!

318
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,161
<i>STARCK: Miller. Miller, are you okay?</i>

319
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,914
Looks like Skipper got a case
of the willies.

320
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,083
Cooper, get back to your post.

321
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,586
<i>STARCK: Miller, your heart rate</i>

322
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,170
I'm fine.

323
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:40,264
JUSTIN: I think I've reached the door
to the first containment, Dr Weir.

324
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,600
<i>WEIR: The Engineering decks</i>

325
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,810
Okay, let's take a look.

326
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:05,289
What the hell is this place, Dr Weir?

327
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,458
<i>WEIR: It allows you to enter</i>

<i>the magnetic fields.</i>

329
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,381
Looks like a meat grinder to me.

330
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,220
PETERS: I'm on the bridge.

331
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,230
Got some blood here.

332
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:48,207
There must have been a coolant leak.
Man, this shit is everywhere.

333
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:53,962
Coolant level's on reserve,
but well within the safety line.

334
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,310
Miss Peters,
could you turn back and left?

335
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,898
- What is it?
- Ship's log.

336
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,128
It's stuck.

337
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,924
It's pretty jammed in there.

338
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,304
(SCREAMING IN ALARM)

339
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,601
What the hell happened to his eyes?

340
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:53,522
- Explosive decompression.
- Decompression doesn't do that.

341
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:59,153
<i>D.J.: Looks like it was caused by...</i>
<i>I don't know, an animal or something.</i>

<i>Look at the damage to the soft tissue,</i>
<i>massive abrasions.</i>

343
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,033
Corpse-sicle.

344
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,705
JUSTIN: I'm scanning for life forms.

345
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:18,380
Man, I'm getting some
really strange readings in here.

346
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:33,187
Let me see if I can get some power up.

347
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,033
That's the core, the gravity drive.

348
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,208
The heart of the ship.

349
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,393
Justin. Justin, you're breaking up.

350

(SCREAMING)

351
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,906
Justin, come in.

352
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,669
- What is it?
- I don't know.

353
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,671
The life scan just went off the scale.

354
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,142
Something's wrong, Starck.
Pull him out. Pull him out.

355
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,525
Shit!

356
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,030
He's in trouble.

357
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,283
- Go, Coop.
- I'm gone.

(MILLER SCREAMING)

359
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,324
Boarding party, sound off.

360

This is Miller. Can anybody hear me?

361
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,878
- What the fuck was that?
- Pressure emergency!

362
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,256
We've lost the starboard baffle.
The hull's been breached!

363
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,968
I'll contain it here for as long as I can!
Get out!

364
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,095
We're losing atmosphere.

365
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:16,475
There are pressure suits in the airlock.
Go!

366
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,310
Here I come. Here I come.

367
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,524
Hold on, Baby Bear.

368
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,902
I'm almost there, almost there.

369
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,575
I got you. I got...

370
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,286
Watch out. Watch...

371
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,415
I got you. What the fuck is this?

372
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,292
Hold on.

373
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:48,048
Captain Miller.
Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.

374
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:52,135
- Smitty, where you been all my life?
<i>- We have a major situation here, sir.</i>

375
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,639
We've lost the starboard baffle,
and the hull's been breached.

376
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,433
The safety circuits, they have failed.

377
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,352
- Do we have time for a weld?
<i>- No, sir.</i>

378
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:04,523
We've got 218 litres of gas left, sir,
and then we've got nothing.

379
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,150
The oxygen tanks, they failed,
they're broken.

380
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,487
- Sir, we are fucking dead!
- What about the Event Horizon?

381
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,239
What?

382
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,158
- She's got air and power.
- It's our only chance.

383
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,369
There's no way
I'm getting on that bastard.

384
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,162
We don't even know
what happened on that ship.

385
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,081
It beats dying, Mr Smith.

386
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:25,252
I want all personnel on board
the Event Horizon, pronto.

387
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,338
- We'll meet at the air tanks.
- I'm ahead of you, sir.

388
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,299
Bringing all thermal units online.

389
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,302
Hold tight. Prep for G's.

390
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,680
Gravity in five seconds.

391
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,990
Wake up, open your eyes. All right?
Just hang in there.

392
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,515
Dr Weir.

393
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,351
Well,

394
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:26,313
I brought most primary systems online,

395
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,273
- for now.
- Thank you.

396
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:32,152
- Starck, what's our status?
- The antenna array is completely fried.

397
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:35,447
We've got no radio,
no laser, no high gain.

398
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,365
No one's coming to help us.

399
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,452
- This air tastes bad.
- Yeah, carbon dioxide, I know.

400
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,829
It's building up
with every breath we take.

401
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,457
And the CO2 filters
on the Event Horizon are shot.

402
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,084
So, we take the scrubbers
from the Clark.

403
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,170
- That gives us what?
- Enough breathable air for 20 hours,

404
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,422
but after that,
we'd better be on our way home.

405
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:12,442
SMITH: I'm on the port side of the hull,
approaching the dorsal heat sink.

406
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,864
Holy shit.

407
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,414
Captain Miller. Captain Miller,
do you copy? Over.

408
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,875
I copy, Mr Smith. How's my ship?

409
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,837
Sir, we've got a 7-metre fracture
on the outer hull.

410
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:35,215
<i>We should be able to repair her,</i>
<i>but it'll take an awful lot of time, sir.</i>

411
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,884
Negative. 20 hours, we run out of air.

412
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,302
Understood, sir.

413
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,765
What happened here, Doctor?

414
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,654
Okay, how is he?

415
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,284
His vital signs seem stable,
but he's unresponsive to stimuli.

416
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,202
I don't know.

417
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,750
He might wake up in 15 minutes.

418
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,588
He might not wake up at all.

419
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,424
Look, Skipper,
I know this shit sounds weird,

420
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:21,970
but, I mean, there was like nothing,
and then Justin appeared,

421
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:26,683
and it was liquid,
and the whole core just turned solid.

422
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,435
It's just not physically possible.

423
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,438
Doctor, please. Please,
don't start in with that physics shit.

424
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,523
I'm telling you, I saw it.

425
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,109
Mr Cooper,
it would mean the gateway was open.

426
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,988
- That's it. The gateway was open.
- The gateway couldn't be open

427
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,490
because the gravity drive
wasn't activated.

428
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,367
Look, I'm telling you what I saw, Doc!
So...

429
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:48,788
- It can't just start up by itself.
- Mr Cooper, you are out of line.

430
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:53,084
Doctor, Mr Justin may die.
Now, I have to assume

431
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:56,546
that whatever happened to him
could happen to all of us.

432
00:36:56,631 --> 00:37:01,343
Mr Cooper says he saw something.
I believe he saw something.

433
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,471
I need an explanation.

434
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:12,187
In my view, Mr Cooper's delusional,
if you don't mind my saying so.

435
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:15,607
But maybe he saw an optical effect

436
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,525
caused by gravitational distortion.

437
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,694
"An optical effect"?
That's fucking poetic.

438
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,655
- Where the fuck...
- Cooper!

439
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,865
I'm sorry. All right.

440
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:29,120
Gravitational distortion.
What could create that, Doctor?

441
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:33,625
If, somehow, a burst of gravity waves
escaped from the core,

442
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:38,630
it could distort space-time.
It could make Justin seem to disappear.

443
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:42,175
It could also
have damaged the Lewis & Clark.

444
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:47,806
- However, I think this is entirely unlikely.
- What's in the core, Doctor?

445
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,058
It's complicated.

446
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,894
How much time do you need?
We have,

447
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,480
17 hours and 48 minutes.

448
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,525
What's in the core?

449
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,988
This is the gateway.

450
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,949
Now, these three magnetic rings,
when they align,

451
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,285
it creates an artificial black hole

452
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,079
which allows the ship to travel
to any point in space.

453
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:14,958
A black hole, the most destructive force
in the universe.

454
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,919
- And you've created one?
- Absolutely, yes.

455
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:23,091
Because we can use that
immense power to bend space-time.

456
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:26,761
Look, it would take the Lewis & Clark
1,000 years

457
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,097
to reach our nearest star.

458
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,641
But the Event Horizon
could be there in a day.

459
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,894
- If it worked.
- You can come down. It's perfectly safe.

460
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,570
So, if Mr Justin was sucked
through your gateway,

461
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,156
he could've gone wherever
the Event Horizon's been.

462
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,700
Theoretically, yes.
But as I told you before,

463
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:52,662
- the gateway can't just open by itself.
- I see.

464
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,456
Lieutenant, I want this room sealed off.

465
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,416
Second containment from here on in
is off-limits.

466
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,127
- Yes, sir.
- Captain, there's no danger.

467
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,254
The gateway's
contained behind three magnetic fields.

468
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,923
- It's perfectly safe.
- Safe?

469
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,383
Doctor, my ship is in pieces

470
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,178
and one of my crewmen
may not make it home alive.

471
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,764
No one else goes near this thing.

472
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,619
Come on.

473
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,624
There's got to be something on this log.

474
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,377
You can do this.

00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,900
What is it? You all right?

483
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,169
What's up? You was out there so long,

484
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,004
I thought you were
trying to break my record.

485
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:51,341
Listen, I'd rather spend the next
12 hours outside

486
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,801
than another five seconds
in this shit can.

It's the final entry in the ship's log.

This is John Kilpack, ship's captain.

494
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:16,115
<i>...and we're preparing to engage</i>

499
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,884
- What is that?
- I'll run it through a few filters,

500
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,095
see if I can clean it up.

501
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,643
- It's a power drain.
- It's the core.

502
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,896
Stay here. Look after Justin.

503
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,815
I don't want anybody else
near that thing.

504
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,108
Wait for me, Doctor.

505
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:55,572
- What's causing the drain?
- Magnetic fields are holding.

506
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,908
Maybe a short in the fail-safe circuit.
I'll check it.

507
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,577
Can you give us a hand?

508
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:22,807
Justin.

509
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,851
Justin, can you hear me?

510
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,979
- He's coming.
- Who's coming?

511
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,816
The dark.

519
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,938
I've got some problems here.

520

Be with me,

Dr Weir?

523

Carbon dioxide can produce
hallucinations, impair judgement.

524
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,572
God damn it, D.J.,
it was not a hallucination.

525
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,031
All right.

526
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,492
Doctor, you were in the duct.

527
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,120
You must have heard something.

528
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,999
- You must have seen something.
- I did.

529
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,752
About an hour ago, I saw my son

530
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,379
lying on the examination table

531
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,134
- and in his legs were...
- Miss Peters...

532
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:05,052
- ...crawling...
- ...if you don't mind my saying so,

533
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,387
it sounds a little like shock.

534
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,306
- Could it be that you're traumatised...
- No. No.

535
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,058
- ...by seeing the body on the...
- Excuse me. No!

536
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,271
I've seen bodies before.
This was different.

537
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,273
She's right. Now, this was real.

538
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:20,026
I felt... I felt heat.

539
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:23,029
This is not something
that's in our heads.

540
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:28,159
Smitty, have you seen anything unusual
at all?

541
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:31,245
No, I haven't seen anything,
and I don't need to see anything, sir,

542
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,498
but I can tell you

543
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,541
this ship is fucked.

544
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:38,294
Thank you for that scientific analysis,
Mr Smith.

545
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,463
Well, you don't expect
to figure it out, do you?

546
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:41,506
All right, Doc.

547
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:42,799
When you break
all the laws of physics,

548
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,300
you seriously think
there won't be a price?

549
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:47,637
You already killed the last fucking crew.
And now you want to kill us as well!

550
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,181
- It's just a fucking ship, all right?
- D.J.!

551
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:53,351
It's just a ship, do you understand?
It's just a big hunk of metal.

552
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:56,229
- There's nothing odd going on.
- D.J.?

553
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,360
- Fine.
- D.J.?

554
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,199
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm just...

555
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,243
I'm sorry.

556
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,953
- Damn it!
- Smitty.

557
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,163
- It's all right. That's it.
- Fucking...

558
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:17,750
That's enough! I want you calm,
I want you cool! Now!

559
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:22,338
- All right.
- You're going back upstairs.

560
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,549
You're going outside on the Clark
with Cooper,

561
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,051
and you're going to repair the ship.
No mistakes.

562
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,929
Mistakes, nobody goes home.
Understood?

563
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,640
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

564
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:35,059
- Sir.
- Get moving.

565
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,860
- Miller.
- What is it, Starck?

566
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,654
I ran the bio-scan
with the DNA-RNA filters.

567
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,989
The results were bio readings...

568
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,699
Of an indeterminate origin. Yes, I know.

569
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,535
Don't you have anything useful
to tell me, Lieutenant?

570
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,413
- I've got a theory.
- Let's hear it.

571
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:59,000
I think that there's a connection between
the readings and the hallucinations,

572
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,419
like they're all part
of a defensive reaction,

573
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:02,753
some sort of immune system.

574
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,422
I don't have time to listen to this.

575
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:05,965
- You have to listen to me.
- To what?

576
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:09,552
I'm saying that this ship is reacting to us
and the reactions are getting stronger.

577
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,512
It's as if the ship
brought back something with it,

578
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,180
a life force of some kind.

579
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,892
What are you telling me?
That this ship is alive?

580
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,686
You wanted an answer,
and it's the only one I've got.

581
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:22,273
No, what I want, Lieutenant,
is to survive the next 10 hours.

582
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,402
Justin?

It's D.J., all right?

591
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,138
I didn't hear anything.
Neither of us heard anything.

592
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,514
- So just calm down, all right?
- Okay.

593
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,599

00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,480
Starck, give me status.

623
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:51,482
You better hurry.
He's engaged the override

624
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,776
- and we can't open the inner door.
- I'll get the kit.

625
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,654
Justin, open the door!

626
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:04,203
Justin, open the door.

627
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,622
- Did you hear it?
- Keep him talking.

628
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:10,126
Yes. Yes, I heard it.
Do you know what it is?

629
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,211
It shows you things,

630
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:15,548
- horrible things.
- What does?

631
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:19,885
The dark inside me
from the other place.

632
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,139
- I won't go back there. I won't.
- No, Baby Bear.

633
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,974
- Come on, open the door.
- What's happening?

634
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:27,309
- I don't think she can talk him down.
- She'd better.

635
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,603
If he opens the airlock,
he's going to turn inside out.

636
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:32,148
- No. You stay with me.
- Almost got it.

637
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,608
- I've almost got it.
- You stay with me, Justin.

638
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,318
Come on, now. Open that door!

639
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,822
If you could see the things I've seen,
you wouldn't try to stop me.

640
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:42,116
No, that's not you talking.
That's not you talking.

641
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,243
That's it. That's it, right there.

642
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,996
Open the door. Go for that button.
Come on.

643
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,247
Okay.

644

No!

645

Captain, Justin just activated the door.
It's on a 30-second delay.

649
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,770
- Hey.
- Starck, get it fucking open!

650
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,105
- Hey, open the door.
- I can't.

651
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,691
The inner door won't open
when the outside door's been triggered.

652
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:17,860
- It'd decompress the entire ship.

They can't do that, Justin.

664
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:49,350
Five seconds.

All the air out of your lungs, Justin.

I'm going to need five units here.
Hold his head still.

677
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:42,820
Okay.

678
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:47,199

I've stopped the bleeding,
stabilised him best I can.

683

He won't be pretty, but he should live

- if we make it back.
- We'll make it.

685
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,061
Starck, what's our time like?

686
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,064
CO2 levels will become toxic
in four hours.

687
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,066
All right.

688
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,902
Peters, we've got to find out
what happened to the other crew

689
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,655
before the same thing happens to us.

690
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:30,993
I can work on the log on the bridge,
but I won't go back to Medical.

691
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:33,746
- Fine.
- Yes, sir.

692
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,375
Justin said something about,

693
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,503
"the dark inside me."

694
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,423
What's that mean?

695
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:46,508
Doctor?

696
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,096
I don't think it means anything.

697
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,062
Don't you walk away from me, mister.

698
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,523
I'd like some answers, Doctor.

699
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:04,193
I'd like to know why one of my men
tried to commit suicide

700
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:08,447
by throwing himself out of an airlock.
I'd like to know what caused that noise.

701
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,157
Look, thermal changes in the hull

702
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:13,535
could've caused the metal
to expand and contract rapidly,

703
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,162
causing reverberations.
This is possible.

704
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:19,291
Bullshit! You built this fucking ship.
You've given me nothing but bullshit.

705
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:21,627
What do you want me to say?

706
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:25,714
You said the ship's drive
creates a gateway.

707
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,466
- Yeah.
- To what?

708
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,677
- I don't know.
- Where did it go?

709
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:33,722
- Where did you send it?
- I don't know.

710
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,225
Where has it been
for the last seven years?

711
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,393
Look, I don't know.

712
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,561
"I don't know,"
is not good enough, Doctor.

713
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,522
You're supposed to be
the fucking expert.

714
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,732
I need answers. That's your job.

715
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:47,653
- Now, the other place, where is that?
- I don't know! I don't know!

716
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:49,571
Look,

717
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:52,366
there's a lot of things
happening around here

718
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:55,911
that I don't fully understand. I need time.

719
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:58,497
I see.

720
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:02,334
Well, that's exactly

I'm telling you, it was his voice I heard.

731
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:28,420
He was calling to me.
A young bosun named Eddie Corrick.

732
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:32,841
We served on the Goliath together.

733
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:38,347
When the O2 tanks ruptured,
four of us made it to the lifeboat.

734
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:42,851
But Corrick was still on board
the Goliath when the fire broke out.

735
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,771
You ever seen fire in zero gravity?

736
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,274
It's beautiful.

737
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,195
It's like liquid.

738
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,615
It slides all over everything.

739
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,535
Comes up in waves.

740
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,580
And they just kept hitting him,

741
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,624
wave after wave.

742
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,462
He was screaming for me to save him.

743
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,131
What did you do?

744
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,968
I did the only thing I could.

745
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:21,390
I closed the lifeboat hatch,
and I left him behind.

746
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:27,980
I swore I'd never lose another man.

- That's just it, D.J., I never told anybody.

00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,992
But this ship knew about it.

01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:39,737

940
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:43,240
she was alive.

Weir's activated the gravity drive.
We got to shut it down.

- How? The bridge is gone.
- What about Engineering?

You think you can shut it down
from there?

I don't know the process.
Dr Weir was the expert.

975
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:08,589
I don't want to go
where the other crew went, okay?

976

- Okay, we blow the fucker up.
- We blow it up?

978
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:15,679
Do like Weir said. Blow the corridor,

979
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:20,434
separate us from the rest of ship.
Use the foredecks as a lifeboat.

With any luck, TDRS will pick up
our emergency beacon.
