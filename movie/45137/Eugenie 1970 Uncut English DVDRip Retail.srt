1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,074
EUGENIE

2
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,595
Lewd women.

3
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,829
Let the voluptuous heroine
of this story be your model.

4
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,599
After her example, be heedless
of all that contradicts pleasures'

5
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,391
divine laws, by which all
her life she was enchained.

6
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:50,480
As for all you 'young' maidens,
thus achieve the ultimate in pleasure.

7
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,474
Observe this ceremony of sadism,

8
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,792
which illustrates that truth.


9
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,430
Let us turn again to
the words of De Sade himself:

10
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:12,278
"Voluptuaries of all ages, of either sex,
it is to you only I offer this work.

11
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,876
Nourish yourselves
therefore upon its principals.

12
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,916
They favour your passions,

13
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,639
and these passions are nought
by the means nature employs

14
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,837
to bring man to the end
she prescribes for him.

15
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,871
Harken only to these delicious promptings,

16
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,037
for no voice, save that of the passions,

17
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,512
can bring you complete happiness,

18
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:52,028
and so a smattering of roses
along the thorny paths of life."


19
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,276
Hello. Eugenie!

20
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,708
No, of course not.

21
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,873
I was just taking my bath.

22
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,109
Oh Don't worry, I'll prepare everything,
I promise you.

23
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,556
Oh no, I'm sure he'll agree to that.

24
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,159
Yes, Yes, this weekend.

25
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,793
I understand.

26
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,395
Right.

27
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,875
Au revoir.

28
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,031
Eugenie! Haven't you finished yet?

29
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,719
Who were you talking to?
- Nobody.

30
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,389
Oh don't be silly!

31
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,993
It must have been somebody!
I heard you talking!

32
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,908
It was just a friend.

33
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,519
A boy?
- No.

34
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,519
Then who?

35
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,279
Can't you leave me alone?
Questions, questions all the time!

36
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,839
I can't meet anybody,
go anywhere, do anything,

37
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,558
without you wanting to know everything!

38
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,314
I'm old enough to do
what I want to, when I please!

39
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,077
Oh! Eugenie, come back!

40
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,155
What's the matter?

41
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,799
It's Eugenie! She's so easily
upset I can't understand her.

42
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,198
She probably feels the same about you.

43
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,155
Where are you going?

44
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,268
A business appointment.
- But the office is closed.

45
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,031
I'm not going to the office.

46
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,274
What can I do for you?

47
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,438
This the right road for Madeira?

48
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:39,317
Straight ahead.
It's about three miles I think.

49
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,195
Thank you.


50
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,878
Do you think there's going to be any rain?

51
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,475
Not here.

52
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,876
I telephoned yesterday to Madame Ren?.

53
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,155
I'm expected.

54
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,835
Come on in.

55
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,352
Sorry, but we have to watch it.

56
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,679
Now I recognise you.

57
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,636
Madame Ren? told me
to expect you and a lady.

58
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,749
Follow me, she's in the oriental suite.
- All right.

59
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,315
Good morning.


60
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,718
If you want anything, ring the bell.

61
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:03,675
All right. All right.

62
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,839
Do you come here often?

63
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,117
I used to, years ago.


64
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,595
I've never been to a place like this before.

65
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,439
I prefer to go to a quiet place,

66
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,919
we've both too many friends.

67
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,792
You needn't look so nervous.

68
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,549
We're alone.

69
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,037
I find it hard to realise.

70
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,190
I've watched you for so long from a distance,

71
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,558
never daring to believe that...

72
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,472
I was available?

73
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,200
Didn't you know that every woman has a price?

74
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,475
You?

75
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,635
Are you shocked?

76
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,675
But you're rich.

77
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,317
I said nothing about money.

78
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,914
I don't understand.

79
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,038
You have other possessions.

80
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,075
What do you mean?

81
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,875
Eugenie.

82
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,915
What about her?

83
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,632
Oh, nothing.

84
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,396
We met some time ago at a party.

85
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,592
We've become quite friendly.

86
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,274
I want to invite her
to spend a weekend on my island.

87
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,637
Her mother would never allow it.

88
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,154
Need she know?

89
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,275
Or, is the price too high?

90
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,389
But why?

91
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,239
What do you want with her?

92
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,232
Perhaps you should ask
what do we want with each other?

93
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,759
I spoke to her this morning

94
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,637
and she pleaded with me to convince you.

95
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,629
Have I succeeded?

96
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,753
Is anything the matter?

97
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,509
But she's...

98
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,310
She's so young, so innocent.

99
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,509
I know, that's what makes her so attractive.

100
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,834
You won't shock her?

101
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,675
No, I promise I won't.

102
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,113
I... I would never forgive
myself if she came to any harm.

103
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,400
We made a bargain.

104
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:20,472
Yes, and I'll keep it.

105
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,068
You won't hurt her?

106
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,679
Of course I won't.

107
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,519
Is that the island?

108
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,789
Yeah, that's it.

109
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,194
Oh, it's beautiful.

110
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,074
Where are the servants?


111
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,994
There's only Therese.

112
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,915
I don't think I know her.

113
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,758
Is she one of your new discoveries?

114
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,350
Yes. I met her in Arta Faugasta last summer.

115
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,078
Are you sure she can be trusted?

116
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,998
She's been deaf and dumb since birth.

117
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,757
She only knows how to serve me.

118
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,594
She'll be useful in many ways.

119
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,871
You didn't answer my question.

120
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,712
Was that entirely wise?

121
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,078
Do you love me for my wisdom?

122
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,033
And the rest of the servants?

123
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,435
Augustin took them
to the mainland this morning.

124
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,758
He's bringing Eugenie back with him.

125
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,393
Eugenie, wonderful.

126
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,999
How did you manage it?

127
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,029
Willpower.

128
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,909
You wanted it, so I willed it.

129
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,472
Isn't that how it's always been with us?

130
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,955
My dear...

131
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,199
What about the others?

132
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,680
They'll be here. Later.

133
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,879
How well you've planned it.

134
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,273
I had you to inspire me.

135
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,196
Eugenie!
- Marianne!

136
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,273
Eugenie, how nice it is to see you!

137
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,029
Good morning.

138
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,279
Of course, you haven't met.

139
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,598
My elder brother, Mirvel.

140
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,440
If Eugenie hasn't met me,
I can at least claim to have met her...

141
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,678
I'm afraid I... don't remember.

142
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,439
At the D'Masquino's party.

143
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,834
And again two weeks ago,
the French embassy.

144
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,675
I was that man who
couldn't take his eyes off you.

145
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,633
Augustin, put the suitcases in my room.

146
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,989
Oh... don't be embarrassed my dear.

147
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,354
I didn't know you had a brother.

148
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,549
A step-brother.

149
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,280
Seriously, he's been admiring
you from afar all Summer.

150
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,833
He insisted that I invite him.

151
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,759
I told her that otherwise I'd kill myself.

152
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,512
So taking pity on his youth...

153
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,838
And innocence...

154
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:30,989
I told him he could come.

155
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:52,835
Marianne!

156
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,595
Marianne!

157
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,795
What are you reading?

158
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,034
Nothing in particular.

159
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,394
Ah, the Marquise de Sade.

160
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,835
Fascinating.

161
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,157
It seems my sister is quite a collector.

162
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,595
Have you read it?

163
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,396
No, if I'd been found with it in
the convent, I'd have been expelled.

164
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,955
No modern home is complete
without the works of the Marquise...

165
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,956
I don't think my mother
would agree with that!

166
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,555
So much truth.

167
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,068
And so misunderstood.

168
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,433
"For the young and inexperienced
there's no better passport to life:

169
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,791
'tis but folly on our parents when they
foretell the disasters of a Libertine Career.

170
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,833
There are thorns everywhere.

171
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,151
But along the path of vice,
roses bloom above them.

172
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,239
Profit then from the fairest
period of your life.

173
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,756
These golden years of pleasure
are only too few and too brief.

174
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,715
For we are so fortunate
as to have enjoyed them.

175
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,877
Delicious memories console
and amuse us in our old age.

176
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,395
'tis us, my dear.

177
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,838
You will remain in human memory."

178
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,559
Well said, brother.

179
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,030
I don't normally give
my best performances in public.

180
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,595
Oh, that's not what I've heard.

181
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,714
Oh, but Eugenie,
what are you doing reading a book?

182
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,559
In lovely weather like this,
we should all be outside.

183
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,073
How about a swim before we eat?

184
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,875
I've got a better idea...
- Yes?

185
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,035
Oh!

186
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,555
Get out!

187
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,799
Who is she?
Why have I never seen her before?

188
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,949
She never leaves the island.

189
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,235
Poor girl.

190
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,635
She's happy enough.

191
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,679
As she can't speak or hear,
other people disturb her.

192
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,159
She prefers solitude.

193
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,588
Oh, I'd better unpack.

194
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,752
Oh, why bother?

195
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,511
I have enough clothes for the both of us.

196
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,355
Oh!

197
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,830
Oh, wonderful!
- Just look!

198
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,874
And they're all yours?

199
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,268
You can take whatever you like.

200
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,798
Half of them I'll never wear again.

201
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,833
Oh. What a lovely dress!

202
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,474
Can I have this one?

203
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,638
You can have whatever you like.

204
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,875
Oh...

205
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,797
Come, let's have a bath now, hmm?

206
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,995
OK!

207
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,115
You know, you're so good to me,
I can hardly believe I'm here.

208
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,639
My mother thinks I'm spending the
weekend with some school friends.

209
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,118
My father was supposed
to drive me to the station.

210
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,599
Instead, he brought me to the harbour,

211
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,274
where the boat was waiting,
just as you promised.

212
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,233
Come, let me help you.

213
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,513
Don't be shy.
You've nothing to be ashamed of!

214
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,475
You know, one day
a man will do what I'm doing.

215
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,471
His hands will replace mine.

216
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,435
Come on!

217
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,833
Let's get some sun.

218
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,880
Lie down,
let me put some of this on you.

219
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:11,279
Oh, I can do it myself.

220
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,595
Not so well...

221
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,391
And afterwards,
you can take care of me.

222
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,553
Are you glad to be here?

223
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,349
Do you need to ask?

224
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,917
Do you remember what I promised you?

225
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:55,117
Yes, you promised me
information and advice.

226
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,318
Good. There's so much for you to learn.

227
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,238
Are you sure you're ready to begin?

228
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:37,878
Yes. If you're the teacher, of course I am.

229
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:46,355
Alright. Well. Let's start.

230
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,912
I give you a toast!
- A toast!

231
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,595
To Eugenie, the most adorable
of all nature's adorable creatures.

232
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,559
Eugenie, you're not drinking!

233
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,796
To myself?
- And why not?

234
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,839
A degree of selfishness
is a very important part

235
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,439
of the armoury of
a woman of experience.

236
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,119
OK, I'll obey my teacher!

237
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,439
Good girl!
- Bravao!

238
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,113
Hmm. I'm not used
to that much wine you know.

239
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,959
A good wine helps
to strengthen one's resolution.

240
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,632
But good resolutions I hope.

241
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,280
Wine has got nothing to do with virtue.

242
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,476
But a great deal to do with pleasure!

243
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,589
Sister, you've wined
and dined us to perfection.

244
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,878
But I still feel...
something's missing - Music!

245
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,559
Romantic for preference.

246
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,838
MI've got the very thing...
prepared and waiting.

247
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,833
Augustin!

248
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,753
Were you watching us perhaps?

249
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,949
On no, Sir!

250
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,512
I don't believe you, but never mind.

251
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,519
If you play as well as you lie,

252
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,678
we'll all be quite content.

253
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:11,954
Oh, ignore my brother!

254
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,673
He's drunk too much, as have we all.

255
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,878
So play for us, and lull us into gentle oblivion.

256
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:45,518
<i>Voice in the night</i>

257
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:54,079
<i>In the hollow heart of darkness</i>

258
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:01,317
<i>A voice I hear lamenting</i>

259
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,039
<i>Through love</i>

260
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,476
<i>Is dead</i>

261
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,756
<i>Voice in the night</i>

262
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:26,109
<i>Like the echo of my sadness</i>

263
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:33,317
<i>When all the world is silent</i>

264
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,679
<i>Through love</i>

265
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,478
<i>Is dead</i>

266
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:51,040
<i>Deep inside the heart of a man</i>

267
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,475
<i>Love is a promise</i>

268
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:09,433
<i>Made through forgotten</i>

269
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:17,750
<i>So gently spoken</i>

270
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:24,317
<i>So cruelly broken</i>

271
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,039
The wine was drugged.

272
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,389
What of it?

273
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,672
You brought her here as a plaything.

274
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,559
Yes indeed...

275
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,159
As I also brought you.
- You!

276
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,277
Please, no temper! I'm not complaining.

277
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,796
You've performed your duties
with admirable efficiency,

278
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,434
and perfect tact.

279
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,472
Ah, shut up.

280
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,515
What did you say?

281
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,518
I wanted to say... forgive me.

282
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,992
I would remind you Augustin
that when I saw you first,

283
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,597
you were grateful
to have enough to eat,

284
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,279
you had nothing but
the ragged clothes you wore.

285
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,269
No future, and no hope.

286
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,399
But now...

287
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,550
I'm your gardener, and boatman.

288
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,191
Precisely. A man of position
and responsibility.

289
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,515
Come here.

290
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,756
Show me that you haven't forgotten.

291
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,114
Tomorrow they'll arrive.

292
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,679
I heard the bell.

293
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,952
Good. Then we'll wait for the boat.

294
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,797
It should arrive with the tide.

295
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,119
They'll demand a new sacrifice.

296
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,152
I don't know what to do.
It's horrible.

297
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,875
I love her.

298
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,235
Mirvel,

299
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,959
do you remember the vows you took

300
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,518
when you entered the order,

301
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,391
and signed with your own blood?

302
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,712
I remember them sister.

303
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,119
I know my duties.

304
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,274
Believe me, she won't escape.

305
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,512
She will be mine
before the sacrifice starts.

306
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,788
I must have her.

307
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,032
I fell asleep...
and had such a strange dream.

308
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,639
Or was it a dream?

309
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,669
Oh, you drank too much at lunch.

310
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,672
We thought we'd let you sleep it off.

311
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,994
Where is everybody?

312
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,918
Resting, like yourself.

313
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,110
It was terrible. So cruel.

314
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,193
But wonderful too.

315
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,799
Was it only a dream?

316
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,991
How can I tell? It was your dream.

317
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,355
Yes, it was.

318
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,309
A dream I've had so many times before.

319
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,872
But this time it was real.

320
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,870
In this bed, and with...

321
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:18,279
Eugenie! Sister! Where are you?

322
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,235
Where are you hiding?

323
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,834
Don't let him come in.

324
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,158
Erm, go away!
We're changing for supper!

325
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,956
Shh!
- Well, don't be long!

326
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,079
Ooh!

327
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,035
No!

328
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,549
Where's Augustin?

329
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,951
Oh, I sent him down to the boathouse.

330
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,072
He's probably singing to himself.

331
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,359
And how beautifully he sings.

332
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,234
Oh, occasionally
I prefer the record player.

333
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,555
Click click!

334
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,916
Less troublesome...
and much more obedient.

335
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,911
I should've thought
that hardly possible.

336
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,797
Your knowledge of my
requirements dear brother is extensive,

337
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,191
but not necessarily complete.

338
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,957
My dear ladies, do you mind if I smoke?

339
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,314
Oh, please do.

340
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,518
I don't think smoking is a vice.

341
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,632
My father does it all the time.

342
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,319
One's parents habits
are a dangerous guide

343
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,280
to the difference between vice and virtue.

344
00:50:11,281 --> 00:50:15,558
Oh, is that another quotation from
the works of the Marquise de Sade?

345
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,314
No, I made it up myself.

346
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,673
At least, I think I did.

347
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:27,955
What's that?

348
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,757
It's just a night bird I expect.

349
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,239
It's getting cold.

350
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:48,108
Oh, can't you think of
something amusing for us to do?

351
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,032
Let's play games.

352
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,032
Lovely! What shall we play?

353
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,755
You're the hostess.

354
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:59,353
Well I suggest... charades.

355
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,231
But we're only three people.

356
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,839
It's possible...
let's go into the other room.

357
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,353
Oh no no no,
we'd better stay here.

358
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,919
Remember Eugenie,
you have nothing to fear.

359
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,388
Why should I be afraid?

360
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,519
Oh well,

361
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,313
remember the dream
you had this afternoon?

362
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,512
Maybe you'll dream again tonight.

363
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,835
I hope not.

364
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,035
Ah...

365
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,755
Or do I?

366
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,958
It's very difficult.

367
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,952
What do you think about dreams?

368
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,917
Dreams are only an extension
of our own desires or fears.

369
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,195
Oh...

370
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,669
Smoke?
- Should I?

371
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,878
Oh, now really, dear!

372
00:52:14,879 --> 00:52:16,836
Don't be ridiculous,
of course you should.

373
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,313
This cigarette tastes funny.

374
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,798
They're Turkish... Oriental.

375
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,315
They're sweet, but rather nice.

376
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,393
You haven't told us what,
or how we play it.

377
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,908
In a moment.

378
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:58,031
Imagine yourself... free of all restraint.

379
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,356
Floating on a cloud...

380
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,430
Observing below you all the foolish
earthbound men and women.

381
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,915
We are your friends, Eugenie.

382
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,476
Disciples, like your host,
of the divine Marquise.

383
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,478
He whose lessons
we have learned so well,

384
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,200
and to whom in homage,

385
00:54:25,201 --> 00:54:28,158
we wear the very costumes of his time.

386
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,192
We are coming to celebrate
your initiation, Eugenie,

387
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,917
into the practises to which
the Marquise gave his name.

388
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,400
We shall be watching you, Eugenie.

389
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:49,396
Observing, and admiring
your aptitude to learn.

390
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:15,072
Cruelty, far from being a vice,

391
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:19,154
is the first sentiment
nature injects in us all.

392
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,398
Cruelty is natural.

393
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,279
Cruelty is simply the energy in man

394
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:29,829
which civilisation has
not yet altogether corrupted.

395
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,871
Female cruelty is, if anything,
more active than the male.

396
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:38,357
Announce a cruel
spectacle a burninga battle,

397
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,753
you will see droves of women come running.

398
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,439
But these occasions
are not numerous enough

399
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,159
to feed their fury.

400
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,671
They contain themselves and they suffer,

401
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,391
as you Eugenie, must suffer, too.

402
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,749
Good morning, Eugenie.

403
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,028
Good morning, Augustin.

404
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,478
Good morning, Madame.

405
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,600
Will this wind drop so we
can go out on the boat?

406
01:03:38,601 --> 01:03:40,431
Perhaps.
- I hope so.

407
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,315
Ahhhhh!

408
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,994
What's the matter Eugenie?

409
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,275
Have you had another dream?

410
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,434
Oh. No! This time it wasn't a dream!

411
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,674
They beat me and...

412
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,070
They beat you?

413
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,353
Then where are the marks?

414
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,875
I don't understand.

415
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,115
There... come along.

416
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:40,277
But what about the man in the
red coat and all his terrible friends?

417
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,956
Eugenie, I think you must
have had another dream.

418
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,158
And all those people you speak of...

419
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,070
are as unreal as the marks

420
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,318
you thought where on your body.

421
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:08,835
You see?

422
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,236
Then what happened?
- Nothing!

423
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,231
You fell asleep and we carried you to bed.

424
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,999
It was then I fear
that your nightmare began.

425
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,114
Thank Heavens that
it really was a nightmare.

426
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,357
I feel so happy now.

427
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,559
Then this is no time for tears!

428
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,788
The whole day lies ahead of us,

429
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,873
so let's enjoy ourselves together.

430
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,879
Wait!

431
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,478
I'll race you up to the house!
- OK!

432
01:06:53,479 --> 01:06:54,515
I'll give you a start OK?

433
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,796
One... Two... Three!
- See you!

434
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,153
That music again.

435
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:23,955
What about it?

436
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,634
I heard it in my dreams, yesterday.

437
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:33,715
Come along.

438
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,835
Dream on, Eugenie.

439
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,671
Dream of all that has happened to you.

440
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:09,152
Taste again the pain and the pleasure,

441
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,718
for soon it will be time for you to wake.

442
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:31,635
Marianne!

443
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:40,715
Marianne!!

444
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,075
Is anybody there?

445
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,158
You!
- Eugenie!

446
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,633
You... you murdered her!

447
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,910
Shall we say she
fulfilled her purpose.

448
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:25,874
Dear Therese,
she delighted in her own suffering.

449
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,200
So when the time came for her to die,

450
01:12:28,201 --> 01:12:29,599
she was quite content.

451
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,599
I don't understand!

452
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,069
Don't you?

453
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,679
Poor Eugenie.

454
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,714
And after I planned it especially for you.

455
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,193
For me?
- Of course my dear.

456
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,478
I told you the truth when first we met.

457
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,918
I've been watching you for weeks.

458
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,069
Hoping...

459
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:01,311
Hoping that some day we would share
the same stimulating experience...

460
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,994
You've never been out of
my sight since you've been here.

461
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,275
No!

462
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,235
Yes!

463
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,150
But... might your sister...

464
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,594
Madame Saint Ange
is not only my step-sister...

465
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:25,798
But for the past two years
has been my mistress as well.

466
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,795
I don't believe you!

467
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:30,789
Then ask her yourself.

468
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,029
But not yet!

469
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,993
Relax Eugenie.

470
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,195
No!

471
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:54,553
Let go of me!

472
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,075
Marianne!

473
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:31,675
Marianne!

474
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,035
Did you love him?

475
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:41,395
Once.

476
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,911
But now I am glad that he's dead.

477
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:49,511
And I am glad that you killed him.

478
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,354
But why me?

479
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,751
Because since he first saw you,

480
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,036
it was you he wanted and not me.

481
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,391
But why did you ask me here?

482
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:11,309
Because of him. And my own plans.

483
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:16,149
Please! Please, I must go
home! I must go home tonight.

484
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:22,192
Poor Eugenie.
I'm afraid that will not be possible.

485
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,039
Why not? Why not?

486
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,510
I have invited company.
Especially for you.

487
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:39,350
Eugenie! We meet again.

488
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:57,391
Everything that has gone before

489
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,435
has been a preparation for this moment.

490
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:04,909
Last night we played a...
a charade.

491
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,791
The whips that beat
you were made of wool.

492
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,760
The blood was water,
specially stained.

493
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,428
The pain that you
suffered was in your mind,

494
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,872
together with the pleasure.

495
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,033
But now, reality awaits you.

496
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:27,477
At last, she hates you...

497
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,751
but most of all she hates
the man who dared to love you.

498
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:33,795
Whom you killed.

499
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,354
Please let me go.

500
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:41,993
This is the way she planned it.

501
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,236
Step by step.
- Yes!

502
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,279
Save for one thing.

503
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,908
All this, which you so
carefully prepared for her,

504
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,636
is waiting now for you.

505
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,039
No! No! Dolmance!

506
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,716
You can't! No!

507
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:23,880
She planned all this for you, Eugenie.

508
01:17:23,881 --> 01:17:25,438
Why do you pity her?

509
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,559
The play is over.

510
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:06,668
For the author is dead.

511
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:10,554
Or should we say... the adaptor,

512
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:15,394
for the author himself
died 150 years ago.

513
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,280
I approved her plans, and then unknown to her,

514
01:20:23,281 --> 01:20:27,592
I provided a final act,
that was more to the author's taste.

515
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,915
And mine.

516
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,956
First, her lover lying dead,

517
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:36,837
and then her own end, and finally,

518
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:42,916
your own education,
corruption and destruction.

519
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:51,669
You will remain here,
with the body of the man who loved you,

520
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:54,236
and the body of the
woman who hated you.

521
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,276
In the morning, your mother
will learn where to find you.

522
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,511
She will come here with the police.

523
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:07,110
The law is hard, and for a murderess,

524
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,995
however young, however rich,

525
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:12,833
there is no mercy.

526
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:18,598
The last word is from the author:

527
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,710
"I never dine so heartily,
I never sleep so soundly,

528
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,753
as when during the day,

529
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,958
I have sufficiently befouled myself

530
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,514
with what some fools call... crime".

531
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:48,275
Augustin.

532
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:29,636
Hello. Eugenie!

533
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,428
No, of course not.

534
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:35,153
I was just taking my bath.

535
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,078
Don't worry 
I'll prepare everything

536
01:25:42,567 --> 01:25:43,999
I promise you.

537
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,556
Oh no, I'm sure he'll agree to that.

538
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:56,159
Yes, Yes, this weekend Over.
