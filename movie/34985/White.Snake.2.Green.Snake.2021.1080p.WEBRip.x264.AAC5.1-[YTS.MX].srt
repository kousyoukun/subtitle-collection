00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:10,708
<i>Sister!</i>

4
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,208
Sister!

5
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,791
Xian, I'm coming for you.

6
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,958
JINSHAN TEMPLE, ZHENJIANG

7
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:38,000
Today, insects awaken, and spring begins.

8
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,208
We two snake sisters

9
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:42,416
will overturn Jinshan Temple.

10
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,208
<i>Vajra-samādhi</i>, the power of stillness.

11
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:37,500
All living things are contained in me.

12
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,125
Go!

13
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,333
Take her!

14
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:12,625
Sister!

15
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,333
<i>Aum mani padme hūm.</i>

16
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:38,958
Xian!

17
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,250
Xian!

18
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,416
Master!

19
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,166
You're so powerful. Leave her be.

20
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,500
{\an8}Please let her go.

21
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,875
Sister!

22
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,958
-Verta.
-Sister.

23
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,583
I caused all this.

24
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't blame him.

25
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,125
That useless man. He's not your Xuan.

26
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,500
Verta, the monk
won't make things hard for you.

27
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,791
This child.

28
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,625
Give him to his father.

29
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,625
No!

30
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:20,916
Verta.

31
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,875
Keep going!

32
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:23,916
Sister.

33
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,666
Sister.

34
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,541
Sister!

35
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,208
To Hangzhou's Leifeng Pagoda,
for eternity.

36
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,375
Be a lesson to others.

37
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,791
Sins.

38
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,625
Fahai, you're a joke.

39
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,541
Lust, murder…

40
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,291
You broke every taboo.

41
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,416
What gives you the right to persecute us?

42
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,875
I practice my faith,
but I still have my demons.

43
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,000
I regret that.

44
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,708
I have no right.

45
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,583
But Dharma is greater than me
and is eternal.

46
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,375
I took her in obedience to it.

47
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,625
Excuses!

48
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,208
Dharma this, Dharma that.

49
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,500
We live in peace

50
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,375
and bother no one.

51
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,666
And yet you have to destroy us.

52
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,500
You're only stronger than us.

53
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,666
That's all!

54
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,250
I'm not going to take you.

55
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,708
Go away.

56
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,500
You useless man.

57
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,333
You never managed to help Blanca.

58
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,166
In every incarnation,

59
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,125
you just hurt her.

60
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,500
Becoming a monk
doesn't free you of your bonds.

61
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,291
I'm not leaving.

62
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,958
I'll kill you, you stinking monk!

63
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,416
Entangled fates and empty lives.

64
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,250
The pursuit of illusion

65
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,208
bars entry to Nirvana.

66
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:34,541
Go to the place of self-annihilation.

67
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,708
<i>Sister…</i>

68
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,500
GREAT TREASURES SUTRA:
EVIL OPENS FOUR PATHS.

69
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:05,791
HELL, HUNGRY GHOST, BEAST,
AND ASURAVILLE.

70
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:11,708
ASURAVILLE, THE PATH TRAVELED
BY THE OBSESSED AND THE QUARRELSOME.

71
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,750
What is this place?

72
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,916
Am I in Leifeng Pagoda too?

73
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,666
Sister!

74
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,583
Sister!

75
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,833
Blanca!

76
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,541
Fahai, you bald donkey.

77
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,291
What is this place?

78
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,541
<i>Show yourself!</i>

79
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:14,916
Where are my powers?

80
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,666
Who are you?

81
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,916
Your name?

82
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:50,875
Run!

83
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,500
I'm out of ammunition.

84
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,416
What?

85
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,083
Get in.

86
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:05,750
Thank you.

87
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,916
You're new here, aren't you?

88
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,125
I'm Sun. Sister Sun.

89
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,583
Come on.

90
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,000
Sun--

91
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:38,708
Sun…

92
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,625
What is this place?

93
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,375
Asuraville, devil town.

94
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,833
Asuraville?

95
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,000
Hurry, go inside.

96
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,416
That blasted Bull-Horse gang can't be far.

97
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,500
Who was the guy that saved us?

98
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,958
Him?

99
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,000
He thinks he's a hero,

100
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,208
but he's not so strong.

101
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,625
Also, he doesn't take sides.

102
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,500
In this world,
the weak don't have a choice.

103
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:31,458
Come on.

104
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,416
This is Octopus's territory. Our refuge.

105
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,916
You saw how dangerous it is out there.

106
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,708
In here, it's a bit safer.

107
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,708
But not totally.

108
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,333
What dynasty are you from?

109
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,250
Dynasty?

110
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,666
The Great Song.

111
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,000
What's your dynasty?

112
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,333
1,000 years after yours.

113
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,125
You wouldn't get it.

114
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,958
Here, there's folk from every era.

115
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:22,583
Humans, demons,
and those Bullheads and Horsefaces.

116
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,750
I came two months ago.

117
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,666
I was rock climbing

118
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,666
and 2 m from the peak,

119
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,833
I slipped and fell.

120
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,750
When I opened my eyes, here I was.

121
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,125
Here, I learned that

122
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,791
the spirit world is real.

123
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,916
However, these demons aren't so scary.

124
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,583
They're extremely strong,
but they can't shape-shift.

125
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,625
And no magic powers like in the legends.

126
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,875
Asuraville…

127
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,916
What is it, really?

128
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,083
It's not heaven, hell,
nor the human realm.

129
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,541
In Asuraville, it's dog-eat-dog.

130
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,708
Neither humans nor spirits want to die.

131
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:26,958
You have to be strong.

132
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,875
You know it, babe.

133
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:36,416
I keep telling you, just be mine.

134
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,458
You won't need to risk your life

135
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,000
just to survive.

136
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,750
-Another little sweetie--
-Get lost.

137
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,125
Why so serious?

138
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,375
Why waste your youth…

139
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,041
Let's go.

140
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:12,916
In here, hurry.

141
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,000
Want some soda?

142
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,750
Let me show you some books.

143
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,375
They'll tell you

144
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,250
what has happened in the last 1,000 years.

145
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,041
Is it strange skipping all that time?

146
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,875
I did it before.

147
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,166
500 years that time.

148
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,208
Really?

149
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,000
This book isn't bad. Have a read.

150
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,291
Besides books, there's this.

151
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,000
There's lots of stuff stored inside.

152
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,166
Check out what you missed out on.

153
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,750
Maybe it's not so much.

154
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,208
Here, you try.

155
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:08,833
Strong stance.

156
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,333
Firm grip.

157
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,291
Try again.

158
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,041
Yes.

159
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,458
The city is alive.

160
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,541
Alive?

161
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,375
There's a lot more weirdness.

162
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,666
You haven't seen anything yet.

163
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,916
Whatever this is, I need to escape it.

164
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,541
I have to find my sister.

165
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,208
To leave,

166
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,958
you have to survive first.

167
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:14,000
Damn it. Bullheads and Horsefaces.
Their whole gang is here.

168
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,791
Run! They're occupying the building!

169
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,541
-Why?
-I don't know.

170
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,416
But they'll kill everyone for sure.

171
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:24,750
Hurry!

172
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,916
No exit that way. To the roof!

173
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,416
Mr. Bull.

174
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,333
Master Simon.

175
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,125
Since I came to this city,

176
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:19,291
every minute is life-and-death,

177
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,125
that we've survived till now

178
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:25,708
is no small feat.

179
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,041
No small feat.

180
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:33,333
You really want to fight all the time?

181
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,125
They're already on the roof.

182
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:50,708
Two tigers can't share one mountain.

183
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,291
-Victory!
-Victory!

184
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:59,041
When two tigers fight, one gets hurt.

185
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:02,208
That one isn't necessarily me.

186
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,583
It's time we worked that out.

187
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:08,625
No time like the present.

188
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:10,916
You've got a point.

189
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:35,958
Follow me.

190
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,166
Sister Sun…

191
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,333
Go!

192
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:26,583
Hurry!

193
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:38,250
Run!

194
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:56,458
Get in. Hurry!

195
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:44,208
These demons are getting out of control.

196
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:48,291
In the beginning,
they would appear once a month.

197
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:51,291
Now, it's every few days!

198
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:52,500
So true, Third Lieutenant.

199
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:58,458
Asuraville's cycles
of storm, fire, flood, and poison gas,

200
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:01,291
the four kalpas,
bring on the evil spirits.

201
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:03,708
The kalpas go faster and faster

202
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:06,041
and it's harder and harder to survive.

203
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:09,833
So we have to unite and power up,

204
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,291
conserve our strength,

205
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,416
not open our doors to just anyone.

206
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,375
That's right.

207
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:18,708
Humans and demons don't belong here.

208
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:20,750
This is Raksha territory.

209
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:43,750
I'm neither a Raksha

210
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:46,333
nor a monster.

211
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,250
Simon kept us Rakshas
from being wiped out.

212
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,750
We swore to make him our leader.

213
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:01,458
Third Lieutenant and Fourth Lieutenant,
we welcome humans and demons

214
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:04,833
because they're useful.

215
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:06,958
And her? What use is she?

216
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:13,750
Cursed little demon!

217
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,958
Little Raksha, how vain you are.

218
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,958
I'm not afraid of this stinking mud.

219
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:00,375
I'm not afraid of you.

220
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,416
And I'm not afraid of the Bull-Horses.

221
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,416
You boastful little demon!

222
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,500
Since you made me your leader,

223
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:20,125
in these times,
I've done everything I could

224
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:21,916
to live up to your expectations.

225
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:23,916
However,

226
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,333
regardless of the natural chaos

227
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:28,500
or the reappearance of the evil spirits,

228
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:35,125
supplies are our top priority.

229
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,500
True.

230
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,250
Second Lieutenant.

231
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,916
We have food,

232
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,541
but fuel is low.

233
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:44,875
At sunrise, the evil spirits will retreat,

234
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:47,000
and I'll go to All-Good Market.

235
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:48,708
All-Good Market?

236
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:50,333
And she

237
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:51,833
is going with me.

238
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:54,958
Okay.

239
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,916
If she can bring back supplies,

240
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:02,166
the Rakshas will have a place for her.

241
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,708
As soon as you're ready, we're off.

242
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:33,833
I'll wait outside.

243
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:53,125
These collapsing buildings
are pretty scary.

244
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:56,250
But they expel stuff like cars and food

245
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:59,333
just like tides dump fish on the beach.

246
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:11,291
What kind of people end up here?

247
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,833
People who aren't ready.

248
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,541
Those who resist leaving this life

249
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:17,958
for another reincarnation.

250
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:21,875
True.

251
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:23,541
I'm resisting.

252
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,500
My sister and I were so close.

253
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:28,875
Then she fell in love with a weakling.

254
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,750
If she had to fall in love,

255
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:33,708
why not pick a man
strong enough to protect her?

256
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,208
Not many men are stronger than you.

257
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:48,083
The Bull-Horses. What's their story?

258
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:49,833
Them?

259
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:51,250
They're a monster clan.

260
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:54,083
In Asuraville, besides humans and demons,

261
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:56,708
there are monsters
like Bull-Horses and Rakshas.

262
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:58,458
And those evil spirits?

263
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,166
They once were humans,
demons, or monsters.

264
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,458
No one knows where they came from.

265
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:08,041
But if they bite you, you turn into one.

266
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:29,541
You're a lousy driver.

267
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:38,750
Let's go.

268
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:45,083
Everyone in Asuraville agreed,

269
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:48,333
the area from here on
belongs to All-Good Market.

270
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,041
It's neutral ground, can't be invaded.

271
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:55,125
This Asuraville…

272
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:57,958
The boss of All-Good Market.

273
00:35:58,041 --> 00:35:59,583
She knows it best.

274
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:20,291
Give it to me.

275
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:30,041
Stop him!

276
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:34,958
How dare you!

277
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:37,500
It's you.

278
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:40,291
You know him?

279
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,541
When I first got here, he saved me.

280
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:02,458
Gosh.

281
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:04,291
We have visitors.

282
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:14,250
You wanted to know Asuraville's origins?

283
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:17,375
Asuraville, what's it all about?

284
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:18,625
Why am I here?

285
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:22,416
Here you go.

286
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,916
It seems you know two of my old customers.

287
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,250
I'll tell you. Why not?

288
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,833
The most agonizing thing in the world

289
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:36,875
is unfulfilled desire.

290
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:43,541
Worldly frustration
gave rise to Asuraville.

291
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:46,416
You can't reincarnate.

292
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,000
Traveling through time, you end up here

293
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:53,208
thanks to the strength of your obsession.

294
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,375
Obsession?

295
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,125
It's what you can't get or give up.

296
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:01,000
It torments you
with all kinds of resentment.

297
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:02,916
That is obsession.

298
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:05,541
That unsatisfied desire

299
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,791
concentrates itself on an object

300
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:10,333
that you arrive here with.

301
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:17,958
It's the symbol of your obsession.

302
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:22,000
True, this gourd's love potions
torment me.

303
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:27,125
So how can I get out of here?

304
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,125
Come with me.

305
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:49,458
Since all suffering

306
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:51,916
comes from an attachment,

307
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,750
to stop suffering,

308
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:56,833
let go of what you desire.

309
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:59,666
This pool of water

310
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,250
is called Release.

311
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:06,333
Dive in and you'll escape.

312
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:07,458
It's as easy as that?

313
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:09,458
Of course.

314
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:14,333
The Pool of Release is amazing.

315
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:18,250
Enter and all things will disappear,

316
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,208
with that little obsession included.

317
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:25,125
But before jumping,

318
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:27,041
everyone hesitates.

319
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:29,750
See?

320
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,458
Why is that?

321
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:35,000
Because they see in the water

322
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:38,833
the very thing that torments them.

323
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,458
I'm not ready.

324
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:47,416
Give me more time. I'll pass that exam!

325
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:49,333
I'll pass it for sure.

326
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:52,416
I'll pass it for sure.

327
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:56,166
<i>So much sorrow</i>

328
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:59,500
<i>Who can I tell?</i>

329
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:05,708
<i>A misplaced love and there I fell</i>

330
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:11,125
<i>How to put aside</i>

331
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:15,166
<i>Such beautiful infatuation?</i>

332
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,583
<i>In rain and wind</i>

333
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:24,666
<i>I dwell</i>

334
00:42:11,708 --> 00:42:13,250
Fantastic!

335
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:15,416
The Peach Blossom Fairy has freed herself!

336
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,583
A piece of her soul

337
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:19,625
was attached to that jade.

338
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,958
Now, it's over.

339
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:30,041
Both attachment and soul are gone.

340
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:33,583
She has been cleansed of it all.

341
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:37,833
And so, she has left Asuraville.

342
00:42:58,291 --> 00:43:00,333
Why isn't my obsession clear to me?

343
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,583
It's because your memory is flawed.

344
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:25,041
Verta.

345
00:43:27,791 --> 00:43:28,875
Blanca.

346
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:37,750
Whatever he looks like

347
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:40,333
or whether he remembers me or not,

348
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:42,083
I have to find him.

349
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:44,541
It's because

350
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,500
I remember.

351
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,541
Why must you remember?

352
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:50,625
Why?

353
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:52,458
Why?

354
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:53,833
Why?

355
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,583
Do you want to take the leap?

356
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:05,375
You'll leave Asuraville if you do.

357
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,500
You'll forget the person in the pool.

358
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,750
Your memory gone. You'll be released.

359
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:23,750
It's hard to jump.

360
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:26,125
I knew you wouldn't.

361
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:27,916
If you're in Asuraville,

362
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,416
it's because you can't let go.

363
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:34,291
Goodbye.

364
00:44:34,916 --> 00:44:36,208
I guess this is goodbye.

365
00:44:58,416 --> 00:44:59,416
Another kalpa.

366
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,375
And it's not even 24 hours!

367
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:09,291
Run! It's coming our way!

368
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:25,625
Let's go!

369
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:36,208
These kalpas, what are they?

370
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:38,250
Cycles of calamity.

371
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:41,166
It's the respiration of Asuraville.

372
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,333
Between breaths,

373
00:45:43,416 --> 00:45:48,333
it tries to eliminate
those that won't leave.

374
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:56,041
Hurry, to the Pool of Release!

375
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:21,958
-Hurry! Get in!
-Verta, hurry!

376
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,416
Hurry!

377
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,833
My brush!

378
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:33,458
No!

379
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:49,625
If you don't cut off their heads,

380
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:51,166
you can't kill them.

381
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:06,708
Our supplies were burned.

382
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:11,125
We have to walk back.

383
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:17,750
Are you okay?

384
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:18,958
Yes.

385
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,125
Simon, why don't we take him with us?

386
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:27,375
Why did the guy you saved

387
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:28,791
turn around and hurt you?

388
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:30,541
This is Asuraville.

389
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:32,333
Do you think you're a bodhisattva?

390
00:49:32,416 --> 00:49:34,333
Do you have
a bodhisattva's special powers?

391
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,166
You're just a bad imitation.

392
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:39,166
His heart is good, but he's weak.

393
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,958
He hurts others, including himself.

394
00:49:41,041 --> 00:49:42,500
I've seen people like this.

395
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:45,958
But he still saved me.

396
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:47,750
Let's take him back to Raksha territory.

397
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:51,125
I can't take in someone without a face.

398
00:49:57,833 --> 00:49:59,958
A man with such a face,
walking in Asuraville,

399
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:02,333
is a perfect fit.

400
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:05,375
Okay.

401
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:07,166
I'll take him.

402
00:50:22,416 --> 00:50:23,291
Where are the Rakshas?

403
00:50:24,916 --> 00:50:25,916
Something is wrong.

404
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:27,833
We'll enter through the secret passage.

405
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,833
Go! Get out of here!

406
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:26,375
I'll take you all on!

407
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:34,416
Let's go.

408
00:51:56,791 --> 00:51:57,666
Third Lieutenant!

409
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:47,625
Today, all you Rakshas will die.

410
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,541
Where's Simon?

411
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:56,625
You missed him.

412
00:52:57,166 --> 00:53:00,583
He'll be back for revenge.

413
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:13,291
Victory!

414
00:53:13,375 --> 00:53:19,458
-Victory!
-Victory!

415
00:53:20,083 --> 00:53:22,291
We defeated the Rakshas today

416
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,916
thanks to your efforts.

417
00:53:28,791 --> 00:53:31,250
Out with the old, in with the new.

418
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,916
Heaven's law.

419
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:45,416
The city of Asuraville,

420
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:48,250
the form of a moment.

421
00:53:48,333 --> 00:53:50,416
-Life is brief.
-Life is brief.

422
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,666
-Kalpas run their course.
-Kalpas run their course.

423
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:03,750
Rise.

424
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:06,291
You are now Defenders.

425
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:11,500
Let everyone see the new faces
you have chosen.

426
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:15,791
-Victory!
-Victory!

427
00:54:27,416 --> 00:54:29,083
I'll rise again.

428
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,041
Just wait and see.

429
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,583
A flood kalpa! Run!

430
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:28,208
Hurry, there's a door over there.

431
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:44,291
He's a burden!

432
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,416
Verta, let's flee this place.

433
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,250
Hand in hand, we'll rise again.

434
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:50,333
One day,

435
00:55:50,416 --> 00:55:52,416
we'll escape Asuraville.

436
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:02,333
Don't worry about me.

437
00:56:02,416 --> 00:56:04,125
Go.

438
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,916
Simon.

439
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:29,875
Simon?

440
00:56:31,041 --> 00:56:32,208
Simon!

441
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:34,041
Verta.

442
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,458
If this is how it is,

443
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:39,250
you've become a burden too.

444
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:45,125
Simon!

445
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:12,250
Strong or weak, men are all the same.

446
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:14,541
When it comes to the crunch,

447
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:16,208
they run.

448
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,291
Why did I end up in Asuraville?

449
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:23,458
I've struggled at death's door.

450
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:26,541
But what's the point in resisting?

451
00:57:28,791 --> 00:57:30,333
It's only to know

452
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:32,541
what the world is like.

453
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:35,250
Blanca.

454
00:57:36,541 --> 00:57:37,750
Blanca.

455
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:42,125
Verta.

456
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:47,208
Maybe to get bitten by these creatures

457
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:49,208
and lose all consciousness

458
00:57:49,291 --> 00:57:50,916
would be a kind of release.

459
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,291
Verta!

460
00:57:58,458 --> 00:57:59,791
Verta!

461
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:09,541
Verta!

462
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:11,625
Look at me!

463
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:20,375
Verta.

464
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,583
Keep going!

465
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,458
Blanca!

466
00:58:26,958 --> 00:58:27,833
You're Blanca!

467
00:58:28,416 --> 00:58:29,583
Careful!

468
01:00:17,125 --> 01:00:18,291
Blanca.

469
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:21,083
It's another twilight.

470
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,291
How many have we seen together?

471
01:00:45,416 --> 01:00:46,250
You don't recall

472
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:47,791
being trapped under the pagoda?

473
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:49,041
How did you escape?

474
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:50,291
Who are you?

475
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:52,416
Why are you in a man's body?

476
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:54,708
Of my past,

477
01:00:55,416 --> 01:00:56,375
I have no memory.

478
01:00:57,541 --> 01:01:00,041
All I recall is crossing a road.

479
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:02,333
The light changed.

480
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:03,666
There was a truck.

481
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:09,416
I flew into the air.

482
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,583
Time seemed to stop.

483
01:01:17,166 --> 01:01:18,541
What happened?

484
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:20,666
{\an8}Why was I still in the air?

485
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,666
{\an8}It couldn't be.

486
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,000
{\an8}Someone was waiting for me.

487
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:28,375
{\an8}Time stopped.

488
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:34,083
I know the feeling.

489
01:01:36,166 --> 01:01:37,916
Then my face hit the ground.

490
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,458
When I came to,

491
01:01:39,541 --> 01:01:41,500
I was lying on concrete.

492
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:45,250
There was fire all around, everywhere.

493
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:49,083
And I arrived here.

494
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:05,083
This bone flute in my hands,

495
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:07,125
I still don't know

496
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:09,875
why this represents my obsession.

497
01:02:10,916 --> 01:02:12,083
All I know

498
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:14,375
is I have to leave here.

499
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:17,000
I need to find that person

500
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,125
whose faint image

501
01:02:20,125 --> 01:02:21,666
I saw in the pool.

502
01:02:55,916 --> 01:02:57,125
Asuraville.

503
01:02:58,041 --> 01:03:00,000
It's like the outside world.

504
01:03:00,083 --> 01:03:02,833
Only the strong survive.

505
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:08,625
My sister loved a man whose heart

506
01:03:08,708 --> 01:03:10,041
was greater than his ability.

507
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,333
So I thought,

508
01:03:12,416 --> 01:03:15,083
if I ever fall in love,

509
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,625
it will be with someone strong,

510
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:22,791
who would protect me in times of trouble.

511
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:26,541
I came to Asuraville and met Simon.

512
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:30,083
But he's just another selfish man.

513
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:33,083
In the face of danger,

514
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:34,791
he lies and sells you out.

515
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:36,083
It's the same old story.

516
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,583
So maybe my sister was right.

517
01:03:47,666 --> 01:03:50,416
In the end, strength is irrelevant.

518
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,041
Maybe,

519
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:55,000
if his heart is true, that's enough.

520
01:03:59,375 --> 01:04:01,041
You don't remember me.

521
01:04:01,125 --> 01:04:02,791
So when I got here,

522
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:04,083
why did you save me?

523
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:07,750
I can't explain it.

524
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:10,541
I just knew I had to do it.

525
01:04:11,166 --> 01:04:13,083
No matter how dangerous it was.

526
01:04:13,166 --> 01:04:15,500
Really, it was like that.

527
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,750
When I saw you,

528
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:19,125
you felt so familiar.

529
01:04:23,375 --> 01:04:24,833
Early on, you forgot,

530
01:04:25,625 --> 01:04:27,166
but then seemed to remember.

531
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,541
I understand.

532
01:04:32,416 --> 01:04:33,458
Blanca.

533
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:36,833
In any case, you're here in Asuraville.

534
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:39,458
And we're together again.

535
01:04:40,125 --> 01:04:41,500
It's great.

536
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:12,500
The boss of All-Good Market.

537
01:06:12,583 --> 01:06:15,375
Does she have other ways of leaving?

538
01:06:16,875 --> 01:06:17,833
In all Asuraville,

539
01:06:17,916 --> 01:06:20,958
only she came on her own accord.

540
01:06:21,708 --> 01:06:23,541
She knows the way out for sure.

541
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:25,916
Will she help us?

542
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:29,208
I heard she came to Asuraville

543
01:06:29,291 --> 01:06:31,500
because the people and demons here

544
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:33,416
all have something she wants.

545
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:37,333
She's a merchant.

546
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:42,125
It's true, I'm a merchant.

547
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:45,125
You want to leave Asuraville,

548
01:06:45,208 --> 01:06:47,791
but can you give me what I want?

549
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:51,208
What do you want? Name it.

550
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,333
Come.

551
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:03,666
In the human world,
I run a small business.

552
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:05,125
It's a workshop.

553
01:07:05,708 --> 01:07:09,791
That little workshop has smelters

554
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:12,041
that need lots of fuel every day.

555
01:07:12,666 --> 01:07:16,500
That fuel comes from your obsessions.

556
01:07:17,125 --> 01:07:20,166
The stronger they are,
the fiercer their obsessions,

557
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:21,958
the harder they burn.

558
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:27,958
What I want from both of you

559
01:07:29,291 --> 01:07:31,333
are your obsessions.

560
01:07:35,416 --> 01:07:37,250
Just before you both got here,

561
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:41,208
a disillusioned soul,
at the end of his rope,

562
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:42,791
came to do business with me.

563
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:46,583
He also wants to leave Asuraville.

564
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:50,208
Verta!

565
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:51,875
Simon!

566
01:07:52,583 --> 01:07:57,500
Do you have a grudge against Simon?

567
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:00,375
No.

568
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:05,125
Simon,

569
01:08:05,208 --> 01:08:08,583
have you thought it through?

570
01:08:11,041 --> 01:08:11,958
Do it!

571
01:08:21,416 --> 01:08:25,250
There's another way to leave.

572
01:08:25,958 --> 01:08:27,375
Wish Bridge.

573
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:30,333
Although it's hard,

574
01:08:30,416 --> 01:08:32,500
there are advantages.

575
01:08:32,583 --> 01:08:34,833
You can escape intact from Asuraville

576
01:08:34,916 --> 01:08:37,083
with your body and memories.

577
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:40,041
Simon's choice

578
01:08:40,625 --> 01:08:42,625
was of course that one.

579
01:08:51,666 --> 01:08:55,875
His obsession was fierce

580
01:08:58,041 --> 01:09:00,416
and thus an excellent fuel.

581
01:09:21,416 --> 01:09:24,458
If I take this obsession,

582
01:09:24,541 --> 01:09:28,458
the drive to compete will fade.

583
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:30,750
You'll be weak.

584
01:09:31,416 --> 01:09:33,125
Would you be willing?

585
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:37,833
Strong or weak, what does it matter?

586
01:09:37,916 --> 01:09:39,666
So long as we can leave Asuraville

587
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:41,833
and be together for a while,

588
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:43,333
I'll do anything.

589
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:46,458
And you?

590
01:09:50,541 --> 01:09:51,541
Of course I'm willing.

591
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:54,541
Good, it's a deal.

592
01:09:59,416 --> 01:10:00,375
Look.

593
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:04,625
Asuraville is shaped like a snake.

594
01:10:04,708 --> 01:10:08,708
Its head and tail almost meet.

595
01:10:08,791 --> 01:10:10,250
The intriguing thing is

596
01:10:10,333 --> 01:10:12,166
that the tail

597
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:15,958
is where the evil spirits nest.

598
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:17,875
Even more amazing.

599
01:10:17,958 --> 01:10:20,833
The snake's tail, at times,

600
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:24,875
grows a little bridge at its tip.

601
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:27,875
That's the Wish Bridge.

602
01:10:27,958 --> 01:10:30,125
If you jump from there

603
01:10:30,208 --> 01:10:31,875
into the snake's mouth,

604
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:34,958
you will leave Asuraville.

605
01:10:57,458 --> 01:11:01,500
You have to take care with the jump.

606
01:11:01,583 --> 01:11:03,791
You've got only one moment to do it in.

607
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:05,333
When is that?

608
01:11:06,708 --> 01:11:08,250
Little Demon,

609
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:10,125
I'm a businesswoman.

610
01:11:10,208 --> 01:11:12,041
When the deal is done,

611
01:11:12,125 --> 01:11:13,958
I'll tell you.

612
01:11:18,458 --> 01:11:20,208
Since we've met before,

613
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:22,333
even if the deal can't be done,

614
01:11:22,416 --> 01:11:25,875
I'll let you in on a secret anyway.

615
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:31,291
About the timing of the bridge…

616
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,125
Bullheads!

617
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:39,916
They only just destroyed the Rakshas

618
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,875
and they're already smashing up my market?

619
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:02,166
Raise the iron chains!

620
01:13:04,833 --> 01:13:05,750
Cut it!

621
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,208
Attack that boat!

622
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:35,708
Take it.

623
01:14:09,041 --> 01:14:10,291
Get up there!

624
01:14:11,875 --> 01:14:14,583
Boss, the fire wrecked our defenses.

625
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:16,541
Retreat to the Pool of Release?

626
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:17,708
Let's go.

627
01:14:38,833 --> 01:14:41,541
Master Simon, your old friend is here.

628
01:14:42,375 --> 01:14:43,375
Him?

629
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:45,791
What does he want with this place?

630
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:48,583
He wants all of Asuraville.

631
01:14:53,708 --> 01:14:54,666
That was fast.

632
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:11,375
Master Simon, I'm sorry.

633
01:15:11,458 --> 01:15:13,000
We're trapped.

634
01:15:23,125 --> 01:15:25,791
Boss, this Wish Bridge…

635
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:27,666
I'm afraid I won't make it.

636
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:31,500
But I still need to thank you.

637
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,416
It's amazing, but shedding my obsession

638
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:36,000
gave me instant joy.

639
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:40,125
It's just business. No need to thank me.

640
01:15:47,958 --> 01:15:49,208
Verta,

641
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:50,750
I'm sorry about before.

642
01:15:52,791 --> 01:15:54,083
Goodbye for now.

643
01:16:49,166 --> 01:16:50,250
Simon.

644
01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:53,458
Today, we'll finish this.

645
01:16:54,916 --> 01:16:56,375
Finish?

646
01:16:58,666 --> 01:17:02,083
How do you know this is the end?

647
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:14,500
Simon!

648
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:22,416
Careful!

649
01:17:30,291 --> 01:17:31,416
Blanca!

650
01:17:32,666 --> 01:17:33,666
Blanca?

651
01:17:52,291 --> 01:17:56,625
Today, I've united all of Asuraville.

652
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,375
Boss,

653
01:18:02,166 --> 01:18:04,875
why won't a talent like you join me?

654
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:09,291
To join you,

655
01:18:09,375 --> 01:18:13,000
does one have to lock on
a human skin mask?

656
01:18:15,625 --> 01:18:17,625
Boss.

657
01:18:17,708 --> 01:18:21,541
Do you know how I found you so quickly?

658
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:27,875
Everyone here knows

659
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:30,791
that if you put on this mask,

660
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:33,000
you can change your appearance

661
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:36,583
into anything you want.

662
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:38,541
But few know

663
01:18:39,041 --> 01:18:43,583
that the mask has another small use.

664
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:50,208
It gives off a faint smell.

665
01:18:50,833 --> 01:18:53,250
Wherever he goes,

666
01:18:53,333 --> 01:18:56,375
I can track him down.

667
01:18:57,291 --> 01:19:01,625
The market's layout was clear as day.

668
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
You did very well this time.

669
01:19:06,083 --> 01:19:08,708
It was worth giving you this mask

670
01:19:08,791 --> 01:19:10,250
and saving your life.

671
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:12,750
Blanca?

672
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:17,625
Only after unhooking his mask,

673
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:19,541
did I realize this famous knight-errant

674
01:19:19,625 --> 01:19:21,625
was our master's spy.

675
01:19:21,708 --> 01:19:24,625
Our master is a great strategist.

676
01:19:25,583 --> 01:19:26,916
You're not Blanca?

677
01:19:28,083 --> 01:19:29,458
Who are you, really?

678
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:49,375
You liar.

679
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:52,750
How could I believe you were Blanca?

680
01:19:54,041 --> 01:19:56,166
Put on this human skin mask

681
01:19:56,250 --> 01:20:01,291
and rise as a Defender.

682
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:03,708
The city of Asuraville,

683
01:20:03,791 --> 01:20:05,875
the form of a moment.

684
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:11,208
Life is brief.

685
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:19,500
Kalpas run their course.

686
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:28,333
-Victory!
-Victory!

687
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:31,833
-Victory!
-Victory!

688
01:20:55,166 --> 01:20:56,208
He changed back to his human face?

689
01:20:56,291 --> 01:20:58,583
Doesn't he want to become a Defender?

690
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:05,666
I just realized

691
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:07,458
to give face but get rejected,

692
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:10,208
that's so embarrassing.

693
01:21:13,208 --> 01:21:15,125
Let me tell you something.

694
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:18,000
When a kalpa begins,

695
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:23,375
throw yourself in.

696
01:21:51,916 --> 01:21:55,125
You can have this Pool of Release!

697
01:22:23,333 --> 01:22:24,208
Verta!

698
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,125
Leader! Help me!

699
01:23:02,291 --> 01:23:03,458
Verta!

700
01:23:03,541 --> 01:23:04,541
Verta!

701
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:20,916
Verta!

702
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:44,333
Who are you really?

703
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:48,750
Who are you?

704
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,291
When I first got to Asuraville,

705
01:25:01,875 --> 01:25:04,250
I had no memory and a ruined face.

706
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:07,333
The Bullhead leader saved me.

707
01:25:09,291 --> 01:25:10,958
He gave me

708
01:25:11,041 --> 01:25:12,750
my life.

709
01:25:14,333 --> 01:25:15,958
But the day I saw you,

710
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:18,291
I don't know why, I…

711
01:25:19,875 --> 01:25:21,583
Then in the Pool of Release,

712
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:23,250
I saw that face.

713
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,375
You called her Blanca.

714
01:25:26,666 --> 01:25:28,208
While in the tunnel,

715
01:25:28,291 --> 01:25:29,166
I thought

716
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:32,083
if I changed to look like Blanca,

717
01:25:32,166 --> 01:25:33,583
maybe you would listen to me--

718
01:25:33,666 --> 01:25:34,791
But you're not her!

719
01:25:40,583 --> 01:25:41,958
No, I'm not.

720
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,416
Nor am I strong enough

721
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:47,666
to protect you in Asuraville.

722
01:26:01,083 --> 01:26:02,375
Strength doesn't matter.

723
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:04,833
The strong can lie,

724
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:07,875
as can the weak.

725
01:26:14,541 --> 01:26:16,000
But you know,

726
01:26:16,833 --> 01:26:18,041
I understand

727
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,625
I made a mistake.

728
01:26:22,416 --> 01:26:24,500
Why do I always rely on others?

729
01:26:25,041 --> 01:26:26,666
Weak or strong,

730
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:29,250
they'll all hurt you.

731
01:26:29,333 --> 01:26:33,041
It's better for me to strengthen myself.

732
01:26:34,625 --> 01:26:35,958
Don't apologize.

733
01:26:36,541 --> 01:26:38,083
It's my mistake.

734
01:26:38,875 --> 01:26:40,500
I should've known

735
01:26:40,583 --> 01:26:43,375
that I can only rely on myself.

736
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,416
I won't free myself from obsession.

737
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:50,291
Nor will I rely on anyone else again.

738
01:26:50,833 --> 01:26:52,125
If I'm strong enough,

739
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:53,916
I'll kill Fahai myself,

740
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,083
overturn that pagoda,

741
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:57,791
and release myself from Asuraville!

742
01:27:05,666 --> 01:27:07,291
At the pool,

743
01:27:07,375 --> 01:27:09,458
why did you change back to Blanca?

744
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:11,708
I…

745
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:18,375
Let's go.

746
01:27:18,458 --> 01:27:21,500
At the pool, that fox told me

747
01:27:21,583 --> 01:27:23,416
the secret of Wish Bridge.

748
01:27:55,416 --> 01:27:57,125
What makes the bridge grow

749
01:27:57,208 --> 01:27:59,833
is Asuraville's black wind tunnel.

750
01:27:59,916 --> 01:28:02,625
The tunnel is a place of karmic testing.

751
01:28:03,166 --> 01:28:05,083
If you can survive its many torments,

752
01:28:05,166 --> 01:28:06,458
you will achieve release.

753
01:28:06,541 --> 01:28:10,125
A path will extend
from the serpent's tail.

754
01:28:10,916 --> 01:28:12,416
That's the Wish Bridge.

755
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:21,958
We're here. This is it.

756
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:36,875
Hurry!

757
01:28:42,625 --> 01:28:43,708
Get in!

758
01:28:51,958 --> 01:28:54,416
That fox really sticks her neck out.

759
01:28:58,875 --> 01:28:59,833
Whatever.

760
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:02,416
I'll do it for her and send you in.

761
01:29:05,958 --> 01:29:08,291
Little Demon,
you know why you're in Asuraville?

762
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:13,666
Karma, twists of fate,
it's hard to say for sure.

763
01:29:14,541 --> 01:29:17,625
There's a reason
for your fear and loathing.

764
01:29:17,708 --> 01:29:19,750
And it's in that tunnel.

765
01:29:19,833 --> 01:29:22,916
It's a trial by fire.

766
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,958
A lapse of will and you will burn to ash.

767
01:29:28,833 --> 01:29:30,666
Sure you want to go?

768
01:29:32,125 --> 01:29:33,750
Fear and loathing?

769
01:29:34,375 --> 01:29:35,958
I want to see for myself.

770
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:44,166
Right. Look after yourself.

771
01:29:50,666 --> 01:29:52,083
Thank you.

772
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:24,041
I'm going in.

773
01:30:29,458 --> 01:30:32,000
Verta!

774
01:30:35,583 --> 01:30:36,875
What's in there?

775
01:30:38,708 --> 01:30:39,875
Fahai.

776
01:30:42,666 --> 01:30:44,250
How long was I in there?

777
01:30:45,041 --> 01:30:46,916
Only a moment. Then you came flying out.

778
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:52,041
It's an empty landscape

779
01:30:53,166 --> 01:30:54,875
and I was there for two hours.

780
01:30:54,958 --> 01:30:56,000
What?

781
01:31:01,416 --> 01:31:02,333
I'm going in.

782
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:40,416
You're back, Little Demon.

783
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:42,750
Stinking monk.

784
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:45,208
I've wiped out so much evil,

785
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:47,916
but some always get away.

786
01:31:48,916 --> 01:31:50,041
Little Demon,

787
01:31:50,625 --> 01:31:52,791
you should release yourself
from obsession.

788
01:31:53,375 --> 01:31:54,375
No way.

789
01:32:07,791 --> 01:32:09,666
He's connected to you.

790
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:12,958
Living things
shouldn't be trapped by desire

791
01:32:13,041 --> 01:32:15,708
but should release themselves
through reincarnation.

792
01:32:15,791 --> 01:32:18,375
This city shouldn't exist.

793
01:32:19,125 --> 01:32:20,916
I gave him a golden aura as a talisman

794
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,083
to help him conquer Asuraville.

795
01:32:23,166 --> 01:32:26,791
<i>So he could kill those who wouldn't go,</i>

796
01:32:27,416 --> 01:32:29,166
or force them to leave

797
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:31,250
and be reincarnated.

798
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:33,333
What reward did you give him

799
01:32:33,416 --> 01:32:34,833
to make him a slave to your will?

800
01:32:35,583 --> 01:32:39,208
When Asuraville is empty,
it will collapse and disappear.

801
01:32:39,291 --> 01:32:41,916
I'll stop him from falling into Hell

802
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,708
and keep him whole

803
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,291
so he can go back to his world.

804
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:48,666
Little Demon.

805
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:50,916
You should release yourself too.

806
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:55,500
Everything I do is to help people
into the next life.

807
01:32:55,583 --> 01:32:58,916
I don't need release or your help.

808
01:33:20,916 --> 01:33:22,000
Verta.

809
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:56,375
Don't come here!

810
01:33:57,125 --> 01:33:58,041
I'm okay.

811
01:34:36,875 --> 01:34:40,375
Little Demon, years have passed.

812
01:34:40,458 --> 01:34:42,750
When will you stop?

813
01:34:43,333 --> 01:34:45,333
When I've defeated you

814
01:34:45,416 --> 01:34:47,333
and toppled the tower!

815
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Verta!

816
01:35:20,666 --> 01:35:21,750
Verta!

817
01:35:57,875 --> 01:35:59,208
Your flute.

818
01:36:16,125 --> 01:36:17,166
Too tight?

819
01:36:18,166 --> 01:36:19,208
It's fine.

820
01:36:42,458 --> 01:36:44,625
It has been 20 years, Little Demon.

821
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:48,875
You've never stopped harassing me.

822
01:36:48,958 --> 01:36:51,166
Not until you're overthrown,

823
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:53,416
and the pagoda is toppled.

824
01:38:23,333 --> 01:38:27,250
Dharma is all-embracing,
but things do end.

825
01:38:27,333 --> 01:38:31,208
Not all that is sought is granted.

826
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:33,583
That applies to me too.

827
01:38:34,375 --> 01:38:37,208
I am powerless.

828
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:42,708
Good will prevail.

829
01:39:48,375 --> 01:39:49,333
Verta.

830
01:39:51,625 --> 01:39:53,916
We can leave Asuraville.

831
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,083
"When a kalpa begins, throw yourself in."

832
01:40:41,041 --> 01:40:44,041
Twenty years inside is one day outside.

833
01:40:44,125 --> 01:40:45,458
You're free of your karma.

834
01:40:45,541 --> 01:40:47,666
Asuraville won't keep you any longer.

835
01:40:48,625 --> 01:40:50,416
Go, Little Demon.

836
01:40:57,583 --> 01:40:59,333
My golden aura!

837
01:41:07,916 --> 01:41:11,625
You tricked me, Monk!

838
01:41:12,416 --> 01:41:14,416
You tricked me!

839
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:26,000
Wish Bridge!

840
01:41:27,333 --> 01:41:28,625
The fox said

841
01:41:29,208 --> 01:41:31,291
that when a kalpa begins,

842
01:41:31,375 --> 01:41:33,291
throw yourself in.

843
01:41:51,333 --> 01:41:52,666
What should I call you?

844
01:41:53,708 --> 01:41:55,041
I really don't remember my name.

845
01:41:55,958 --> 01:41:57,625
Call me what you like.

846
01:41:58,208 --> 01:41:59,541
It's only a name.

847
01:42:00,708 --> 01:42:03,500
Sure, it's only a name.

848
01:42:04,916 --> 01:42:06,208
From here,

849
01:42:06,291 --> 01:42:08,083
I'm going to find my sister.

850
01:42:08,875 --> 01:42:10,125
You can go and look

851
01:42:10,208 --> 01:42:12,583
for the person you saw in the pool.

852
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:12,416
Let's go!

853
01:44:26,166 --> 01:44:27,083
Hurry!

854
01:44:56,875 --> 01:44:58,583
A kalpa is rising! A gas kalpa!

855
01:46:24,333 --> 01:46:25,708
Help me!

856
01:46:25,791 --> 01:46:27,125
Hurry, help me!

857
01:47:30,625 --> 01:47:31,625
Verta!

858
01:47:31,708 --> 01:47:32,625
Jump!

859
01:47:46,291 --> 01:47:47,250
Hurry!

860
01:47:54,208 --> 01:47:56,083
The bridge is collapsing. Hurry!

861
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:02,875
I still haven't turned.

862
01:48:02,958 --> 01:48:04,958
Hang on.

863
01:48:05,583 --> 01:48:06,833
I want to leave.

864
01:48:06,916 --> 01:48:09,875
I can't change. I can't.

865
01:48:10,458 --> 01:48:12,583
I have to be able to get out.

866
01:48:15,708 --> 01:48:16,625
Quick!

867
01:48:19,541 --> 01:48:22,666
I can go back.

868
01:48:23,875 --> 01:48:25,291
Jump in…

869
01:48:25,375 --> 01:48:27,333
I'll be saved

870
01:48:27,416 --> 01:48:30,166
and go back home.

871
01:48:35,333 --> 01:48:36,500
Hurry!

872
01:49:58,458 --> 01:49:59,625
You!

873
01:50:23,583 --> 01:50:24,791
Why?

874
01:50:26,250 --> 01:50:28,500
Why did you let him bite you?

875
01:52:01,208 --> 01:52:02,041
No!

876
01:52:09,083 --> 01:52:10,125
No!

877
01:52:10,208 --> 01:52:11,416
{\an8}No!

878
01:52:19,666 --> 01:52:20,541
No!

879
01:52:21,958 --> 01:52:23,166
No!

880
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:25,916
No!

881
01:52:28,333 --> 01:52:29,625
Don't.

882
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:45,833
Verta.

883
01:52:47,375 --> 01:52:49,666
I can't leave Asuraville.

884
01:52:50,791 --> 01:52:52,083
{\an8}Tell me why!

885
01:52:52,583 --> 01:52:54,083
{\an8}Why?

886
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:11,833
It was the day the insects awakened,

887
01:53:12,583 --> 01:53:14,500
and petals filled the air

888
01:53:15,166 --> 01:53:16,583
like now.

889
01:53:19,375 --> 01:53:21,250
I see

890
01:53:22,583 --> 01:53:24,833
the face in the water clearly now.

891
01:53:27,583 --> 01:53:28,875
Blanca!

892
01:53:29,833 --> 01:53:31,625
Blanca!

893
01:54:35,625 --> 01:54:42,583
HANGZHOU

894
01:54:44,083 --> 01:54:46,083
<i>I left Asuraville</i>

895
01:54:46,958 --> 01:54:49,250
<i>and returned to the world of desire.</i>

896
01:54:51,666 --> 01:54:53,333
<i>That person in Asuraville…</i>

897
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,625
<i>But no one knows</i>

898
01:55:00,708 --> 01:55:02,958
<i>where Asuraville is in the world.</i>

899
01:55:04,708 --> 01:55:05,916
<i>And there's my sister too.</i>

900
01:55:07,666 --> 01:55:09,333
<i>Leifeng Pagoda has collapsed.</i>

901
01:55:10,125 --> 01:55:11,458
<i>And her?</i>

902
01:55:42,958 --> 01:55:45,208
Grandpa, that tower, is it Leifeng Pagoda?

903
01:55:46,041 --> 01:55:46,958
Yes.

904
01:55:49,416 --> 01:55:50,625
It didn't fall?

905
01:55:51,333 --> 01:55:54,041
It's still standing?

906
01:55:56,083 --> 01:55:59,375
No. It was rebuilt recently.

907
01:56:00,083 --> 01:56:01,416
Were you away?

908
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:03,250
Everyone knows that.

909
01:56:03,333 --> 01:56:05,583
The old pagoda collapsed long ago.

910
01:56:06,166 --> 01:56:07,083
Collapsed?

911
01:56:07,166 --> 01:56:11,333
Yes, if it had really trapped White Snake,

912
01:56:11,416 --> 01:56:13,708
she would have been free years ago.

913
01:56:13,791 --> 01:56:17,958
Maybe she cleansed her karma
and has been reincarnated.

914
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:21,916
She could be anywhere.

915
01:56:30,833 --> 01:56:33,458
You should go see the exhibition there.

916
01:56:33,541 --> 01:56:37,625
After the pagoda fell, they found things,

917
01:56:37,708 --> 01:56:40,208
treasures they've put on display.

918
01:56:50,541 --> 01:56:52,500
Come, look at this here.

919
01:56:53,208 --> 01:56:57,458
Now, here is a mystery of the tower.

920
01:56:58,458 --> 01:57:01,625
-It's a hairpin.
-Correct, it's a hairpin.

921
01:57:01,708 --> 01:57:04,583
Notice it's an ancient hairpin,

922
01:57:04,666 --> 01:57:07,458
but this hairpin

923
01:57:07,541 --> 01:57:09,458
is made of bone.

924
01:57:15,583 --> 01:57:18,541
But why was it under the tower

925
01:57:18,625 --> 01:57:19,958
and why was it broken?

926
01:57:20,041 --> 01:57:21,958
Where's the missing piece?

927
01:58:20,750 --> 01:58:22,333
<i>Sister!</i>

928
01:58:28,541 --> 01:58:29,458
<i>You don't recall</i>

929
01:58:29,541 --> 01:58:30,750
<i>being trapped under the pagoda?</i>

930
01:58:30,833 --> 01:58:31,708
<i>How did you escape?</i>

931
01:58:31,791 --> 01:58:32,833
<i>Of my past,</i>

932
01:58:32,916 --> 01:58:34,125
<i>I have no memory.</i>

933
01:58:35,083 --> 01:58:36,333
<i>When I first got to Asuraville</i>

934
01:58:36,416 --> 01:58:38,333
<i>I had no memory and a ruined face.</i>

935
01:58:38,416 --> 01:58:39,416
<i>There was fire all around.</i>

936
01:58:41,375 --> 01:58:42,375
<i>You don't remember me.</i>

937
01:58:42,458 --> 01:58:44,041
<i>-Why did you save me?
-I'm not sure either.</i>

938
01:58:44,125 --> 01:58:45,916
<i>I just knew I had to do it.</i>

939
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,375
<i>When I saw you, you felt so familiar.</i>

940
01:58:47,458 --> 01:58:48,625
And this bone flute in my hands.

941
01:58:48,708 --> 01:58:50,333
<i>I still don't know</i>

942
01:58:50,875 --> 01:58:52,958
<i>why this represents my obsession.</i>

943
01:58:57,500 --> 01:58:58,625
Blanca.

944
01:59:00,625 --> 01:59:02,625
That person in Asuraville

945
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:05,375
was you, right?

946
01:59:07,333 --> 01:59:09,375
You escaped

947
01:59:09,458 --> 01:59:11,500
and also went to Asuraville.

948
01:59:13,041 --> 01:59:14,333
<i>Today, insects awaken.</i>

949
01:59:14,416 --> 01:59:16,000
<i>We two snake sisters</i>

950
01:59:16,083 --> 01:59:17,000
<i>will overturn Jinshan Temple.</i>

951
01:59:17,083 --> 01:59:19,000
Sister!

952
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:21,041
Verta.

953
01:59:21,125 --> 01:59:22,041
Keep going!

954
01:59:22,125 --> 01:59:23,916
Blanca!

955
01:59:24,708 --> 01:59:26,416
<i>Why isn't my obsession clear to me?</i>

956
01:59:30,416 --> 01:59:31,916
<i>I need to find that person</i>

957
01:59:32,458 --> 01:59:33,458
<i>whose faint image</i>

958
01:59:34,291 --> 01:59:35,916
I saw in the pool.

959
01:59:37,708 --> 01:59:38,875
{\an8}Tell me why!

960
01:59:39,458 --> 01:59:40,791
{\an8}Why?

961
01:59:42,333 --> 01:59:46,125
<i>It was the day the insects awakened,</i>

962
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,958
<i>and petals filled the air</i>

963
01:59:49,541 --> 01:59:50,875
<i>like now.</i>

964
01:59:54,291 --> 01:59:55,625
I see

965
01:59:57,208 --> 01:59:59,583
the face in the water clearly now.

966
02:00:01,125 --> 02:00:03,500
It was the day the insects awakened,

967
02:00:03,583 --> 02:00:05,333
and petals filled the air.

968
02:00:07,708 --> 02:00:08,833
Blanca.

969
02:00:09,833 --> 02:00:12,250
All along, the person you were looking for

970
02:00:13,083 --> 02:00:14,583
was me.

971
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:32,666
<i>What do you want? Name it.</i>

972
02:00:32,750 --> 02:00:35,500
<i>You forgot your past life
and much of this one too,</i>

973
02:00:35,583 --> 02:00:37,416
<i>but you seem to remember something.</i>

974
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,458
<i>I understand.</i>

975
02:00:39,541 --> 02:00:41,541
<i>I have to leave this place.</i>

976
02:00:41,625 --> 02:00:43,625
<i>There's someone waiting for me.</i>

977
02:00:44,541 --> 02:00:45,958
What should I call you?

978
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,416
I really don't remember my name.

979
02:00:49,291 --> 02:00:50,416
Call me what you like.

980
02:00:51,541 --> 02:00:52,875
It's only a name.

981
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,083
<i>From here,</i>

982
02:00:55,166 --> 02:00:56,458
<i>I'm going to find my sister.</i>

983
02:00:57,083 --> 02:00:58,375
<i>You can go and look</i>

984
02:00:58,458 --> 02:01:00,541
<i>for the person you saw in the pool.</i>

985
02:02:30,791 --> 02:02:32,166
Verta?

986
02:02:44,291 --> 02:02:45,416
<i>Blanca.</i>

987
02:04:12,791 --> 02:04:19,791
STAY TUNED FOR POST-CREDIT SCENE

989

Where's the thing?

990
02:08:12,125 --> 02:08:14,333
My enemy is in sight.

991
02:08:15,625 --> 02:08:18,625
Revenge is mine!
