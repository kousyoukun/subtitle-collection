1
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,540
Your credit based on several factors.

2
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,090
After listening to your story ...

3
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,720
- ... Sorry, your credit is denied. - Rejected?

4
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,520
- You're fooling us! - There must be a mistake.

5
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,410
I have a document that shows my payments smoothly.

6
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,900
I understand, Mr. Vega, but as I said, there are other factors.

7
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,760
You've been on the verge of a credit line is drawn.

8
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,690
Look, Mr. Guillermo Gomez.

9
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,880
My friend Bernie had heart surgery twice for six months.

10
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,620
We have ...

11
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,080
We have 10 recipes for drinking ...

12
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,200
... Every two weeks.

13
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,700
Do not anyone move!

14
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,740
Listen! I want all of them lie down on the floor!

15
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,020
Do not try to do desperate!

16
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,770
And you, old man!

17
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
Be careful, Frank.

18
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,080
- Why do you act recklessly? - I'm sorry, Bernie, was not accidental.

19
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,140
Hey, what are you doing?

20
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,960
Because I have to spend $ 199 to make up for this boring recipe.

21
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,190
It was only $ 190, right? Just so you know ...

22
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,530
... The drug is purchased from money pensiunanku!

23
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,860
You just talk to me now that the drug is purchased from pensiunanmu, huh?

24
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,240
No no. Only to turn when someone comes to stir.

25
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,680
- You ungrateful, jerk? - You're a jerk!

26
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,700
You've made a mistake, asshole.

27
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,730
Everybody down!

28
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,080
This is great!

29
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,490
Only by using a chair and a baseball bat ...

30
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,090
Two parents ...

31
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,060
... Managed to thwart the robbery.

32
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,780
Is Bank provides loans as a token of gratitude?

33
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,480
No. But they gave us something else.

34
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,600
Certificates of appreciation.

35
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,930
See, this is cool!

36
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,760
Look at us, pal. Greater than Vin Diesel.

37
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,600
Nonsense!

38
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,050
- Who is it? - Rosario.

39
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,490
- What is he now in Arizona? - Florida.

40
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,880
The, the ... dia ..

41
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,160
- ... He is fine. - I'm sorry, friend.

42
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,280
No, no. Everything is fine.

43
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,640
I'm happy for him.

44
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,830
Rosario had a good job.

45
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,020
Julie get into a good school. I'm happy for them.

46
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,000
- Hello? - You want to avoid me? All Right.

47
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,570
Cursed if you're not the most difficult to find.

48
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,840
Carmen, my love, what happened?

49
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,350
Nothing special, except the fact that I'm getting married!

50
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,480
What?

51
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,320
By Jeffrey. We met six weeks ago.

52
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,100
Approaches such as molasses and pie.

53
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,730
I've never been tied like that, Frank.

54
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,110
This is good news! I can not wait to meet you!

55
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,060
- There is free time this weekend! - Oh yeah?

56
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,280
Yes I Do! I want you to be present in the wedding!

57
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,250
Gather your belongings. Come!

58
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,940
Carmen, very good!

59
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,310
We wanted to come, but ...

60
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,350
I and Bernie now has financial problems.

61
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,370
Shut up, Franklin.

62
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,590
Your basis miser, always a lot of reasons.

63
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,470
Not that forget the goodness of your father, but ...

64
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,870
There are no buts, Vega. Already booked your flight schedule.

65
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,860
Already paid for your vacation.

66
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,550
So, prepare your bags and come here.

67
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,940
Before I came and dragged yourself.

68
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,920
Pal ...

69
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,200
... This garbage does not fit with my stomach.

70
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,590
Why did not want to eat fish on the plane? Throw it!

71
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,750
I'm going to the toilet.

72
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,530
Son of a bitch.

73
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,360
Hello, Miss.

74
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,060
What do you have for dessert?

75
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,280
Still getting used to, I do not have time for a relationship.

76
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,310
But I had time for one night.

77
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,740
- Do you agree with such an experience? - One night ...

78
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,690
... Two nights ... As it should be.

79
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,830
Excuse me, sir.

80
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,210
You should go back to your seat.

81
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,680
This is my new place.

82
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,220
Can I see your ticket?

83
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,660
Come on, let alone me.

84
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,950
It's my pleasure.

85
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,980
Son of a bitch.

86
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,280
The passengers and gentlemen, we will land in Baton Rouge.

87
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,390
The time is now 15:00 and the temperature is 18 degrees.

88
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,010
I forget the smell of the south side.

89
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,040
- Yes I Do! - What is it us?

90
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,000
I do not think there are other names such as Vega in Louisiana.

91
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,510
Gentlemen, my name is Khan. Can I carry your bag?

92
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,900
- I can take it alone. - I insisted.

93
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,450
Hell, you can take my bag.

94
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,670
Please, gentlemen.

95
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,570
We have to get used to.

96
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,670
Oh, come on!

97
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,810
oh crap!

98
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,720
- Give me the bag! - Fuck you!

99
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,790
Did you like it, asshole?

100
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,000
I'll take care of this.

101
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,540
You're quite large in Ventruz.

102
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,790
Okay, okay.

103
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,840
Son of a bitch!

104
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,620
I will kill you!

105
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,460
Nose ... you broke my nose!

106
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,250
- It's your bag, baby. - Thank you.

107
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,150
Have a nice day.

108
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,350
- Her parents live here? - Yes sir.

109
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,140
Finally able to start a party!

110
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,580
- You look great! - Now I have a chance, man.

111
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,480
I no longer singles!

112
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,220
Come on, you'll meet my parents.

113
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,700
Unfortunately, if I know you have a lot of money, I could ask him six months ago.

114
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,080
Mom, dad, I introduced Frank and Bernie.

115
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,130
Welcome, gentlemen. It's nice to meet you.

116
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,100
- Thank you for the welcome. - You're so good-natured.

117
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,300
- The pleasure is ours. - Carmen, say that they are so good.

118
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,910
Calm down, Miss.

119
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,530
Hey, you guys.

120
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,150
Oh God, what's going on!

121
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,160
Kyle and his friends.

122
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:40,630
Earl, you see? / That's just a scratch. It's okay, he will be fine.

123
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,850
They are friends brother from California. Bernie and Frank.

124
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,550
- Hello? - Do you?

125
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,770
Yes, he's my brother from another mother.

126
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,860
My mother was pregnant with tubes. I think sperm confused.

127
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,650
For me it is the same.

128
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,200
Anyway we love Ronnie!

129
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,330
Welcome and I'll show you to your room.

130
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,460
Gosh, Earl!

131
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,900
- This house seems well organized! - Not so need a big cost.

132
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,340
- How so? - This family of hereditary property.

133
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:18,050
Heritage house my great-grandfather, because of his service in the war.

134
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,580
As part of the fund negro farmers.

135
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,920
Really nobody knew this house was built.

136
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,650
Mineral resources, including oil,

137
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,810
- ... Make us a millionaire. - Damn!

138
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,800
- Karma which "sucks!" - It is true.

139
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,940
I hope you do not mind sleeping in one room.

140
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,980
We will have a lot of guests and the house is definitely full.

141
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,850
- I do not know you're retired. - Oh, yes ...

142
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,120
I spent some time. Many years ago.

143
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,250
Do not even know who I am.

144
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,040
It seems that everything is here, but if you need anything else ...

145
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,200
- ... Do not hesitate to ask. - I would be sent "chick"?

146
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,910
- After midnight. - Why so late?

147
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,010
Buddy, I want to thank you.

148
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:20,010
For taking care of my girls, when in LA.

149
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,380
- He was very meaningful to me. - Carmen is very special.

150
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,850
Oh no!

151
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,300
Afternoon workout in one hour, you have to get dressed!

152
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,340
I keep a couple of coats in the closet for you.

153
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,920
I think according to your size.

154
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,160
Let's get there!

155
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,610
- The whole country is here! - You can see it.

156
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,040
Gentlemen, I offer some of the best drinks in Louisiana?

157
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,940
Of course!

158
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,390
Wow, I have never seen a plant drinks.

159
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,620
This is not a plant, lord, this Mid Sprigs.

160
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,520
Really refreshing!

161
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,780
Hope you enjoy!

162
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,940
- Mid Sprigs...
- Kita tos!

163
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,970
As seen in the magazine!

164
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,500
You're the old farts are awesome!

165
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,350
Here it is! I can not leave it for a while without someone seduce.

166
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,030
Oh dear, meet Frank and Bernie.

167
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,090
Jeffreyku Recommend this!

168
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,080
Gentlemen, an honor to meet you. You Frank, right?

169
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,440
- Nice to meet you. - And you, definitely "Green Machine".

170
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,590
Yes, nice to meet you. I said congratulations!

171
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,290
- Thank you sir. - You found an amazing woman!

172
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,780
I know that. I am blessed!

173
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,960
I certainly good in a past life, it was worth it.

174
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,860
Is not that funny?

175
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,950
Jeffrey!

176
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,100
It seems that someone called me.

177
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,000
Excuse me, gentlemen.

178
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,440
Dear?

179
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,240
A great guy!

180
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,290
I never felt like it! Make me happy!

181
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,240
What happened to him?

182
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:38,960
- Sorry, I ask it. - He had an accident in Afghanistan.

183
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,460
- It happened when he save his friend. - I am sorry.

184
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,360
It is okay.

185
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,640
Will I lead the life of a three-meter.

186
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:08,330
Thanks to everyone for coming. Now I want to make a speech a little.

187
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,180
It's hard for a father to see his daughter grow up ...

188
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,460
... And then give it to a stranger.

189
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,570
Wait!

190
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,770
This is my first wedding speech text.

191
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,330
Here it is! It is hard for a father ...

192
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,090
... To see his daughter grow up ...

193
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,070
... And give it to strangers.

194
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,030
Took it, and then give them back.

195
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:43,840
But it was quieter when her husband-a man like Jeffrey.

196
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,440
Your mother and I hope you get the best!

197
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,380
- Now we are toast! - Yes I Do.

198
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,260
Unfortunately, I wish you all the best in the world forever!

199
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,030
Always keep happiness, love ...

200
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,950
... And you know the next.

201
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,770
- Leave him! - Shut up!

202
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,670
Bernie!

203
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,680
God, Bernie, help me!

204
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,670
Frank?

205
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,860
Frank!

206
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,000
Damn!

207
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,410
How can you sleep at a time like this?

208
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,010
Where is Carmen?

209
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,000
I'll tell you.

210
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,440
Carmen was kidnapped!

211
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,640
I do not know, I was sleeping ...

212
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,550
... And then some people came and took him.

213
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,040
I only remember up there. Damn, what you do not look for it?

214
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,430
Relax, this is part of the procedure.

215
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,050
You do not understand! They kidnapped my fiance!

216
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,800
Shit. We do not hear anything, while Frank screaming.

217
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,870
- When we arrived, they were gone. - I'm worried about my son!

218
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,580
Can you give evidence?

219
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,220
I do not see much in the dark.

220
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,330
They have a ski mask ...

221
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,110
- They are quite a lot. - How many are they?

222
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,980
- Eight ... ten. Probably more. - How do you not know?

223
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,530
Perhaps because the prison is full.

224
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:44,850
- They attacked me and nobody helped me! - Now you blame me?

225
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,750
Gentlemen!

226
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,010
It would help us to restore it.

227
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:54,080
You must find her. The town is small.

228
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:59,670
239 139 people, exactly, Mr. Vega.

229
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:06,140
- Maybe a little more. - Sir, I think my job ends here.

230
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,040
We form a team.

231
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,110
Post a surveillance camera.

232
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:20,500
I do not want to just wait for news wayangku mere child.

233
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,890
I do not care how much money you took out.

234
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,210
You have to restore my son now.

235
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,550
- Now the time is not right. - Someone called about Carmen.

236
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,050
- Did he call? - Yes I Do.

237
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,640
Give me the phone.

238
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:46,470
Without offering, Mr. Morgan. Five million for your daughter.

239
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:51,660
You've got 32 hours, waiting for the phone again to meet at the location of the meeting.

240
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,880
If you do not follow my instructions. Your daughter is going to die.

241
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,250
I do not know, maybe. Black money is not good publicity.

242
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,970
Whoever did it, it's all been planned.

243
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,510
What do you feel have enemies? Or could they know you?

244
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:18,730
Of course, someone constantly makes investing or selling a house.

245
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,100
I do not believe this is happening.

246
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,700
He's my little girl! Must be married on Sunday!

247
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,130
You can help us.

248
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,800
The town is small, there is rarely a crime like this.

249
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,170
And I know that you have experience in LA.

250
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,350
- Not really. - You can help us find him.

251
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:56,890
- Ny. Morgan, the police have been doing. - They will not do anything!

252
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,030
Their heads are so immersed in the judge that they could not see anything.

253
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,720
We need your help.

254
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,180
I hope you can bring Carmen home!

255
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:11,710
Hey! Look what I found at the gate.

256
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:18,240
Buford? Anggota The Rouge Club?

257
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,000
Ronald found at the northern gate.

258
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:29,720
We may never know. I never liked the club.

259
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:34,310
We'll check it out. Might be found instructions. Thank you, gentlemen.

260
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,390
You know who did it, right?

261
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,260
I'll tell you something.

262
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,220
This is not Los Angeles.

263
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,120
This Baton Rouge.

264
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:51,520
We do not work like the way you there.

265
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,210
If you think going to intervene in this case, ..

266
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,580
... Even a little, ..

267
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,500
... I'll lock you up and will not let go.

268
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,680
Enjoy the rest of your day course.

269
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,380
Let us catch this bastard.

270
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:14,220
片源:涵 聽譯:媛 組幕字點零

271
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,460
Let me be clear, now ...

272
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,090
- ... Without running. - What Are?

273
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,160
Nobody would beat each other.

274
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,790
But I'm not going with the people.

275
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,380
You're so whiny!

276
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,740
We are no longer in LA.

277
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,600
26 hours 32 minutes

278
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,660
Damn chair "bite" my ass!

279
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,870
Destroyed piece by piece.

280
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:19,160
The good news is that my cock is still here.

281
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,600
Hello, Miss!

282
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,970
Come On.

283
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:56,890
The last time I saw a bunch of white people amongst blacks.

284
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,720
Bernie, you'd better get out of the routine.

285
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:06,080
- Meet new people. - But not the kind of people like this.

286
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,810
But on the other hand, my mother told me, I do not really closed.

287
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,250
Hello, master and mistress!

288
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,050
We would like to ask.

289
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,630
Giliranmu, Frank.

290
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,340
I'm looking for Mr. Buford. What any of you who know him?

291
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,240
I know!

292
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,720
Hey, how you doing, buddy?

293
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:45,730
- We see you're very friendly. - Yes, you look very friendly.

294
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,640
Stay on the floor.

295
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,710
Die, motherfucker!

296
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:16,430
Now, I ask again!

297
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,430
Where Buford?

298
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,010
I see you do not want it.

299
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:36,740
Mr. Buford! Nice to meet you.

300
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,560
Why do not you have a VIP card?

301
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,340
- Where is Carmen? - Fuck!

302
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,130
Okay, then.

303
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,890
Ah ... ah ... sit back.

304
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,370
I do not know! I swear!

305
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,630
I had access inside.

306
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,560
Landry's Loft!

307
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,160
- Where was Landry's Loft? - In the city.

308
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:12,680
7th Street. The place is easy to find.

309
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,640
Thank you for your cooperation.

310
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,550
Ronnie? How are you, friend?

311
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,800
- I'm going to be late. - I understand.

312
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,080
Busy people. Many activities.

313
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,800
I could see.

314
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,540
I ask for your help as a friend. My car was in the garage.

315
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,000
So, can I borrow your car this week. How Do?

316
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,900
My car?

317
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,110
This week ...

318
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:11,810
... Our brothers will come and I have to pick them up.

319
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:17,480
Oh yes, I understand.

320
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:23,200
Listen, you lend your car or I destroy.

321
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,170
You just select.

322
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,880
Hey ... what are you supposed to be somewhere else?

323
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,980
- Yes, we got lost. - Go.

324
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,180
If you do not want to let me go, I do not want anything from you.

325
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,040
So, you want to hold the host?

326
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,520
We take your shoes, let your feet cold.

327
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,420
Listen to me now, weirdo.

328
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:42,670
If you can get away ... do you think you made a mistake.

329
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,260
Okay, then.

330
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,410
Please take your food.

331
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:11,330
Old fart damn catch Buford.

332
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:19,130
- Can you come out for a while? - Yes I Do.

333
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,890
How can you not able to stalk the old fart?

334
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:38,630
- I do not know what happened. - I told them not to screw up.

335
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,480
20 hours 16 minutes

336
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,290
Why I'm always one to get good seats?

337
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,140
The same reasoning to sit next to a beautiful woman.

338
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,570
What are you talking about? Not all women are beautiful.

339
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:27,180
Hello, Miss. We want to meet Landry.

340
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,900
- Does he live here? - He does not live here anymore.

341
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,800
So, off you go.

342
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,400
Can you tell us, where can I find it?

343
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,600
- Get rid of your feet from the door. - Come on, lady ...

344
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,660
You do not have to ...

345
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,880
- I thought he would not attack. - Hold On!

346
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,270
Needless to violence, we just want to talk.

347
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,080
We are men who can not hit a woman.

348
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:08,800
- Now tell us, where Landry! - Fuck!

349
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,520
Let go of me!

350
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,620
Not until you tell me where Landry!

351
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:24,310
- Where is he? - Working in Bakets.

352
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,880
Place for barbecue outside the city.

353
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,770
Usually there in the morning. Now you get out of here!

354
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:34,960
Give up so quickly? I thought we could talk.

355
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,010
Besides you kicked me in the ribs.

356
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,050
Nose bleed?

357
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:08,640
How are you, friend? I'm glad to find you.

358
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,720
Look, Kyle ...

359
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,830
I need 20 bucks.

360
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,910
- I do not have. - I thought you had.

361
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,330
No, really. I do not have.

362
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:31,330
Give! Before I hit you.

363
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,710
Yes alright.

364
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,870
Why do not you get a job?

365
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:46,410
- Who are you? - Friends of Ronald.

366
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,800
I think you need to look for work.

367
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,930
You complain to the grandparents, to protect you?

368
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,850
Should not you have someone to take care of you?

369
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,540
I suggest you get out now, before ...

370
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,440
- Kyle! - What Are?

371
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,270
They are the one.

372
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:09,550
- What Are? - The bank robbery.

373
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:15,330
- Damn! Wow, we are fans of yours! - Kyle?

374
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,340
- Dad! - What is going on here?

375
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,050
No, just chat with Ronnie and "Bad Asses".

376
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,900
- You know them, right? - Yes, I have ever met.

377
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,630
Ladies.

378
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:28,930
Your mother wants us to get home before six o'clock. We have to go.

379
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,240
Bye, Bro.

380
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,200
Bye.

381
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:48,900
I appreciate what you do, but do not make a mess.

382
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:53,000
I want to avoid violence and threats.

383
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,710
Handle wisely.

384
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,820
There are other ways as a defense.

385
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:02,620
- Wisdom what do you think? - Yeah right.

386
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,920
I do not mean to offend you. But I'm not a fan of your tactics.

387
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,050
- There is a better way to solve the problem. - Explain to us.

388
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:17,100
How did you used to be in the military, and now become flabby?

389
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,090
Once you see what I see ...

390
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,410
... I do not want a violent manner.

391
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,160
- Jeffrey! - How are you?

392
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,010
Hello, boys.

393
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:34,450
- I can not believe this is happening. - We'll take care of it, Jeff.

394
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:37,980
I can not stop thinking about what causes it.

395
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,480
Calm down, son. Why do not you sleep?

396
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,220
What do you think I could sleep?

397
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,170
What is that?

398
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:17,610
I am sorry. I through the plant, when parking.

399
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:21,280
For some reason, maybe you do not like.

400
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,280
Only silence on the case.

401
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:30,180
I can not say anything of the things that I know.

402
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:33,780
It seems that the police did not handle the case, right?

403
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,520
Every effort has been deployed to arrest the perpetrators.

404
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:42,080
- Nonsense! - Sorry?

405
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:46,580
Boss mocked as a matter of justice.

406
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,670
Listen, Mr. Vega. I fully support your actions.

407
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:54,590
I suggest not to be confused ...

408
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:57,590
... Let us do our job, okay.

409
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:13,660
Julia asked for a pillow fight with Uncle Frank. I hope you're here.

410
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,840
- Can we talk? - Of course.

411
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,120
Sit down.

412
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:25,040
I want to thank you for your help.

413
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,420
It is okay.

414
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,320
Just give them understanding.

415
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,040
I want you to take it.

416
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,890
It belonged to my father.

417
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,870
Always taken during the war.

418
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,440
Pure titanium. As a talisman lifesavers.

419
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,460
You can see the bullet holes.

420
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,570
- Very nice, but I can not accept it. - Please.

421
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,960
I want to give it to you.

422
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,900
Thank you.

423
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,950
If you can ...

424
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:13,210
- ... May I ask you something? - Of course.

425
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:19,070
Do you always ... be a hero?

426
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,950
I Have No Idea.

427
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:26,830
I wondered what I had something that I had ...

428
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:33,140
- ... Or not. - Just do it.

429
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,590
Be yourself.

430
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,380
And make the right decision.

431
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:44,650
What could be stopped ngobrolnya ...

432
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:47,220
... And sleep?

433
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,000
4 hours 41 minutes

434
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:10,440
- How many times have you rubbing your nose? - I do not count them.

435
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,460
Habits of the parents of the South.

436
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,060
All Right.

437
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:39,440
I promise, if I'm out of here, I'm going to Jenny Craig (fitness).

438
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,630
Password?

439
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,750
"Long beard"!

440
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,870
"Moonlight"!

441
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,910
It takes more pepper. Add it.

442
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:24,250
- All Right. - What do we have here?

443
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,150
Not bad. You can put more peppers. / Thank you.

444
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,360
You mix any here, moron?

445
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,050
Who are you calling stupid, stupid?

446
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:45,710
- Who are you? - Where is Carmen?

447
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,240
You did not answer my question. Where is Carmen?

448
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,250
I'm going to marry her cousin ...

449
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,150
Damn!

450
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:09,790
Halo, 1988!

451
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:19,130
All Right. Who will die first?

452
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:59,250
You like to go to hell!

453
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:07,970
Where is Carmen?

454
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:09,870
- Fuck! - All Right!

455
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:12,050
No, no!

456
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,200
I'll tell you! Stop It!

457
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:20,420
In an old building.

458
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,780
I grab my wallet and car.

459
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,430
You'll never forgive you, asshole?

460
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:51,120
- But the door ...? - Get out of here.

461
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:05,230
Bring me Harrison.

462
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,210
Enter your goal.

463
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:21,960
I hope the big bearded man has a will.

464
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:27,580
I do not know how to get back. / What?

465
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,260
I wrote the wrong address and do not know how to remove it.

466
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,320
Try clicking the "delete".

467
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,800
- Where is the button? - In the "keyboard".

468
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:44,670
I do not need anymore help.

469
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:01,260
Thank God, we do not know where we are.

470
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,160
Raise your hand slowly!

471
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:07,730
- Wait, what? - Shut up and lift up your hands!

472
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:23,620
See you! Glad to see you guys.

473
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:30,880
I'll tell you ... this is not the safest place.

474
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,880
Fuck this kid sucks!

475
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,950
Just try it!

476
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,410
What happened?

477
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:01,660
Come on, they do not want to help us.

478
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,910
Good morning, Mr. Vega.

479
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,010
- Where are you taking us? - It was a surprise.

480
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,440
But I'll tell you, that ... the landscape is very special.

481
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:22,650
I'll tell you ...

482
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,080
I told you not to interfere, but you do not want to listen.

483
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,850
This time you will suffer the consequences.

484
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:35,050
Listen, we will give you a last chance.

485
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:41,310
Do not make me kill you, if it has been completed.

486
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,480
There will be no smoke without fire, bro? Bait is placed ...

487
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:51,790
- ... And you get caught. - You can not run away.

488
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:56,740
I'm the chief of police. I upholder of justice!

489
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:05,910
We will go a long way, gentlemen.

490
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:12,720
You will find peace in the cemetery.

491
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,520
I hope you enjoy "Bon Voyage".

492
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,780
Fuck you!

493
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,280
24 seconds

494
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:50,460
- Hello?
- Wait for us at the dock at 6.

495
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:53,110
Wife who brought the money. Alone.

496
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:57,370
If we look at other people there ... your daughter will die.

497
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:00,180
Wait a minute! Hello?

498
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,580
Excuse me, I'm looking for Sheriff Broussard.

499
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,480
- He'll be back in 20 minutes. - I'll wait.

500
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,990
You want to play canasta? (Playing cards)

501
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,680
The three of us.

502
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:57,030
- I do not know how we get out of here. - Seize their parachutes.

503
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,760
Oh, shit!

504
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:09,670
- Bernie, are you okay? - It feels very sick.

505
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:11,820
He needs help, bro!

506
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,140
He had a liver transplant surgery and body rejected it.

507
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,220
If you do not act, he would swallow his tongue!

508
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,090
Oh, shit!

509
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:24,360
Come on, I need your help!

510
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:02,770
Good evening, friends.

511
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:11,370
Great.

512
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:16,580
- How do I fly? - I have watched "Top Gun" hundreds of times!

513
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,210
We need to understand how to land.

514
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:28,740
Let's see if there are manual in a drawer.

515
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:32,350
Glove compartment? This is not your dad's car?

516
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,960
I tried this.

517
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:43,790
Hey ... hey! Gosh Vega! Do not operate any hasty!

518
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,110
You're a good boy!

519
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,180
We're going to land this plane!

520
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:59,200
I think you have to raise a little.

521
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:01,580
I'm not sure at this point.

522
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,190
- It will not work, bro. - I'm going to try a variety of ways!

523
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:10,760
Frank, try another, may be successful!

524
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,210
- Damn! - Damn!

525
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:08,770
Damn!

526
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:24,040
You never learn in school driving! We can not do anything!

527
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:13,320
Thank you for traveling to Mexico Airlines.

528
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:51,710
There is no signal!

529
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:55,630
- What would you do? - I will ask for help!

530
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:59,330
We are in the middle of nowhere! At least 70 km from the settlement!

531
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:03,610
- So, you just stay here! - You can not, bro ...

532
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:06,370
What about what people say about crocodiles and werewolves?

533
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:08,270
Okay, wait.

534
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:14,320
Bernie, I do not have time for this nonsense. Do you want to come or stay.

535
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,550
You can not do both!

536
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:21,110
What is that?

537
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,590
What is this?

538
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:20,380
No matter whether you're in LA or here, all rushing somewhere.

539
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,840
What do we do now?

540
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,200
Through the roadside.

541
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:04,440
I saw so many security! How do we get there?

542
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:08,380
Why are you always whining? Will I worked!

543
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:17,970
- What are you doing? - I lost my contact lenses.

544
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:25,610
I found it!

545
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,780
Oh, God ...

546
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:33,230
Let's go.

547
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:35,830
Do not move, asshole!

548
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,010
I know you. You're the old fart, right!

549
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:47,990
- Yes I Do. - We are the one.

550
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:50,780
You all are amazing!

551
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:53,520
- Thank you, friends! - I appreciate it.

552
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:57,220
You have many fans.

553
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:59,850
Unfortunately, I have to kill you.

554
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,650
- Please? - What Are?

555
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:03,550
Obliterate you.

556
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,560
- Now, you will die. - Listen ...

557
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:09,040
You do not need to kill two parents.

558
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:12,240
I'm sorry, friend. It's my job.

559
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,450
Go to sleep, asshole.

560
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:25,390
- What happened with wisdom, Earl? - To hell with wisdom.

561
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:29,230
Let us liberate my daughter!

562
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,840
Do you have any ideas?

563
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:55,230
Here you are.

564
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:49,150
How do we know where he is?

565
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:55,060
I think we found it.

566
01:03:56,310 --> 01:04:00,520
- Any suggestions? - None.

567
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:07,230
Let's go.

568
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:11,800
Damn, Earl!

569
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:24,670
- Okay, it's time, folks! - You know, he punyak many events.

570
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:28,750
- Dad, what are you doing here? - Are you okay?

571
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,410
We should get going.

572
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:33,310
We have to go.

573
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:38,510
Come catch this bastard.

574
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:14,080
Would you like a bitch?

575
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:20,230
Very impressive! Drop your weapons.

576
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:24,090
Drop your weapons!

577
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:32,110
- What are you doing, Jeffrey? - I know this must be confusing.

578
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,590
Its true that ...

579
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:37,630
... The plan goes well before you two come.

580
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:41,450
Jeffrey, if you want to cheat us, should have said from the beginning, ..

581
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:44,580
... Before my father signed the check.

582
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:47,390
I always liked humor.

583
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:51,410
Take his gun.

584
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:55,850
No one will hurt her unless there is someone who wants to be a hero.

585
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,050
Go to another room.

586
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:02,870
The Current!

587
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:09,160
You also go.

588
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:12,460
Who are you?

589
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:20,050
You do not intend to marry her, right?

590
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:25,480
She was a remarkable woman, if the situation is different ... who knows ...

591
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:31,420
But this is a business opportunity that will be shared with my cousin.

592
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:35,550
Cousin? Police Chief Broussard?

593
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,640
And.

594
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:39,980
You're right, Mr. Vega.

595
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:45,250
Leave my daughter with us. I gave the ransom.

596
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:47,700
I wish I could trust you.

597
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:53,520
Unfortunately I do not believe you. We have big plans for Carmen.

598
01:07:54,790 --> 01:07:56,590
Son of a bitch!

599
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:59,660
Calm down, Earl.

600
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,100
Later they also arrested.

601
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,970
I doubt Mr. Vega.

602
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:10,390
It's late for everything.

603
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,700
Farewell good.

604
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:19,420
Lucas!

605
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:22,640
Let's go.

606
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:29,730
Oh, damn!

607
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:35,270
I think I'm going to eat barbecue tonight ...

608
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,060
- ... Sprinkled with mayonaise ... - Oh, this bond is very strong!

609
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:43,730
Come On! We still have something in this regard.

610
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:45,810
My hands are tied!

611
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:49,620
We got stuck. Can not get out of here.

612
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:56,600
"Let us go then Louisiana!"

613
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:01,120
"Little getaway to relax!"

614
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:05,660
- You blame me, right? - Of course your fault!

615
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,630
Can not you just once in charge?

616
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:13,860
If it were not for you, we would not be here! / Enough!

617
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:17,040
Can not you at least die in peace?

618
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:27,650
Sorry, pal.

619
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,680
It's a nice ride.

620
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:36,560
- Yes it is. - Yes I Do!

621
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:56,800
- Do you need a ride? - Of course!

622
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,320
Let's go!

623
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,640
I feel embarrassed! You're my white child!

624
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:36,790
Save our lives!

625
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:38,390
How did you know we were here?

626
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:41,290
I Have No Idea! I hid in the trunk.

627
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:47,120
Remains exactly 22 minutes to arrive, before your mother made the exchange.

628
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:50,470
22 minutes? From this place at least 45 minutes!

629
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:52,640
Hit the gas, kid!

630
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:59,940
They have a team!

631
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:04,100
- We need help! - Ronald, borrow your phone!

632
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:39,040
- Jeffrey? - Hello, madam.

633
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,950
I know you would not expect.

634
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:46,880
Give the money and I will hand over Carmen.

635
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:53,720
You ... you! Hell, dirty pig!

636
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:59,270
- Give me the money! - Fuck you.

637
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:09,510
I admire your courage, but it is not needed here.

638
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:14,450
I will not give you anything, until you submit Carmen.

639
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,690
As you wish.

640
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:38,730
Now, I'm going to kick your ass.

641
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:47,470
Come on dear.

642
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:50,930
It's you!

643
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:53,280
Well done, dear!

644
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:59,470
The little boy saved! Finally, I could see!

645
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:05,110
Louisiana police finally arrived!

646
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:15,060
Raise your hands!

647
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:25,260
Oh gosh! Jeffrey!

648
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:29,990
How could this happen?

649
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,880
Son of a bitch!

650
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,660
I think it is mine.

651
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,760
Mr. Vega!

652
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:49,700
You almost managed to mess it all up!

653
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:54,470
Now, you all must die.

654
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,740
I start with you.

655
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:02,810
Asshole fucking.

656
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:05,350
Do not move!

657
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:08,150
Drop the gun, Broussard!

658
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:11,150
What are you doing here?

659
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,760
Has ended, drop the gun!

660
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:17,790
You're dealing with a ...

661
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:24,740
... Which is much larger. If I were you ...

662
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:27,200
... I'm going home.

663
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,110
Take away the children.

664
01:15:30,210 --> 01:15:32,140
Drop the gun, Broussard!

665
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,980
Raise your hands! The Current!

666
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:39,330
Do not act as a brave boy!

667
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:42,970
We recommend that you retreat!

668
01:15:43,730 --> 01:15:45,540
Because I'm going to shoot him.

669
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:49,820
Back Off!

670
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,780
Stay back!

671
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:05,110
You shot me!

672
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:33,770
- Frank, are you okay? - Yes I Do.

673
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:37,750
Damn, bag it to save your life, Frank!

674
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:41,530
This clock!

675
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:45,780
An hour to save your life.

676
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:51,180
Hey, "Green Machine" do you have anything in your pocket?

677
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:57,340
Remains lie, motherfucker!

678
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:15,090
Yah..kami now want to say goodbye.

679
01:17:15,870 --> 01:17:20,110
Come on, are you sure you will not stay a day longer? / I feel bad!

680
01:17:20,770 --> 01:17:24,690
We would like to, but Bernie had to go to the doctor tomorrow morning.

681
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,570
Okay, then. Give me a hug!

682
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:34,000
You do not know how I'm very grateful. Many thanks!

683
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:35,700
- It's okay. - Yes I Do.

684
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,950
Who needs a man when you two?

685
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:42,920
You are always welcome here!

686
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:52,580
There are five minutes before you go. Can I talk to you?

687
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:58,550
Thank you from the bottom of heart.

688
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:01,170
My son has returned.

689
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,260
Words not enough just to thank you.

690
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:10,350
But you gave me something else. For the first time in 30 years ...

691
01:18:10,450 --> 01:18:13,990
... 30 years! I feel alive again!

692
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:17,090
So, I found myself true.

693
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:22,990
I want to go back to dispense justice in places completely disappeared.

694
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:25,680
And I want to do with you.

695
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,880
Accept ... as the "Three old fart" ...

696
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:31,510
... Who kick ass.

697
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:35,060
Sounds great, Earl, but ...

698
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:41,990
- ... Bernie has other responsibilities. - Frank, I know about the library.

699
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:45,540
Bernie has a liquor store. Do not make you stop.

700
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:48,400
I want to make as easy as possible.

701
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:51,590
I will pay for the entire operation.

702
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,440
And you will be paid.

703
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:59,150
You do not have to worry about finances, especially to buy drugs.

704
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:01,050
Are you serious?

705
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:04,440
Serious liver transplantation.

706
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:07,350
What do you think, my friend?

707
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:12,850
What is ready to "cleanse" the country?

708
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:21,510
Coming soon ...

709
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:25,860
...Bad Asses di Bangkok.

710
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,770
Hey, Bernie! You can be more than you are looking for!

711
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:38,380
I tell you, I loved it.

712
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:41,920
And me too!

713
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:50,370
Sorry, sir. You should go back to your seat.

714
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,540
信用額度取決於幾個因素

715
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,090
在聽了你的故事之後...

716
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,720
-...對不起 你的申請失敗 -被拒絕？

717
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,520
-你在耍我們  -肯定是哪裏搞錯了

718
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,410
我有文件能證明我沒有延遲任何付款

719
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,900
我理解的 維加先生 但就如我所說的 決定因素不只一個

720
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,760
您的信用額度是處於最低值得

721
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,690
聽著 吉列莫·戈麥斯先生

722
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,880
我朋友伯尼六個月內進行了兩次心臟手術

723
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,620
我們還...

724
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,080
我們每兩星期...

725
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,200
要喝10種類型的酒...

726
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,700
所有人 不准動！

727
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,740
聽著 所有人給我趴到地上

728
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,020
別想著做些愚蠢的事

729
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,770
而你 老頭

730
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
小心點 弗蘭克

731
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,080
-你為什麼這麼不知死活？ -對不起 伯尼 這不是偶然

732
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,140
嘿 你在幹嘛

733
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,960
因為我不得不花199刀來維持這無聊的食譜

734
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,190
只有190刀吧？你知道的...

735
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,530
這些藥是從

736
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,860
你剛才說這些藥是從

737
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,240
不不 別哪壺不開提哪壺

738
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,680
-你不知感恩 混蛋 -你這個混蛋

739
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,700
你犯了大錯了 混蛋

740
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,730
所有人 趴下

741
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,080
真好

742
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,490
只用了一把椅子和球棒...

743
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,090
兩對父母...

744
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,060
想要阻止這場搶劫

745
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,780
銀行是否為了表示謝意才給你們提供貸款？

746
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,480
不是 他們給了我們其他的東西

747
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,600
一份榮譽證書

748
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,930
看 多酷 啊

749
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,760
看看我們 爸爸 這比馮·迪索還贊

750
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,600
放屁

751
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,050
-這是誰 -羅薩裏奧

752
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,490
-他在亞利桑那州幹嘛 -他是在佛羅里達

753
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,880
這..這...

754
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,160
-...他挺好的 -抱歉 兄弟

755
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,280
不 不 一切都挺好的

756
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,640
我為他而高興

757
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,830
羅薩裏奧找到一份好工作了

758
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,020
朱麗進了一所好學校 我為他們高興

759
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,000
-哈羅？ -你想避開我麼 好吧

760
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,570
如果我找到你 我一定會詛咒的

761
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,840
卡門 親愛的 你怎麼了

762
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,350
除了我即將結婚 也沒什麼特別的

763
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,480
什麼？

764
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,320
新郎是傑弗瑞 我們認識了六個星期

765
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,100
但是就像是蜜糖和派般分不開

766
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,730
我從未感受到如此緊密的聯繫 弗蘭克

767
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,110
這是個好消息 我等不及要見你們了

768
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,060
-我們這個星期有空 -真的麼

769
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,280
是的 我們希望你能出席婚禮

770
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,250
收拾你的行李 來吧

771
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,940
卡門 這很好

772
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,310
我們也想去 但...

773
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,350
我和伯尼經濟出了點狀況

774
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,370
閉嘴 弗蘭克

775
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,590
你這吝嗇鬼 總是有很多借口

776
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,470
不要忘了你老爸的好 但是...

777
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,870
沒有但是 維加 我們已經幫你買好機票

778
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,860
這一趟由我們出錢

779
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,550
所以 趕緊收拾你的行李 來吧

780
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,940
在我飛過去 把你抗過來之前

781
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,920
爸爸...

782
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,200
這東西很難吃

783
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,590
在飛機上不想吃魚麼 扔了它

784
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,750
我去趟廁所

785
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,530
混蛋

786
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,360
嘿 小姐

787
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,060
您想吃什麼甜點

788
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,280
我還沒緩過來 也沒時間交朋友

789
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,310
可是我一整晚都有時間耶

790
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,740
-你想試試看麼 -一晚

791
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,690
按理說...兩晚

792
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,830
不好意思 先生

793
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,210
請回您的座位去

794
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,680
這是我的新座位

795
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,220
我能看下您的票麼

796
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,660
好了 讓我一人靜靜

797
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,950
當然

798
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,980
混蛋

799
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,280
各位乘客 我們即將降落巴吞魯日

800
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,390
現在的時間是下午三點 室外溫度是18度

801
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,010
我已經忘了南部的氣味了

802
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,040
-我也是 -我們是誰？

803
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,000
除了路易桑那州的維加 我想不出還能叫什麼名字

804
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,510
先生 我是可汗 我能幫您拿包麼

805
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,900
-我能自己拿 -請讓我為您拿包

806
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,450
見鬼了 那你就拿吧

807
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,670
是的 先生

808
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,570
我們要學著適應

809
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,670
噢 走吧

810
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,810

好 好

816
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,840
混蛋

817
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,620
我會殺了你的

818
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,460
鼻子...你打斷我的鼻子

819
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,250
-這是你的袋子 寶貝 -謝謝

820
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,150
祝你愉快

821
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,350
-她的父母住在這？ -是的

822
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,140
終於能開趴了

823
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,580
-你看起來很好 -我現在有一個機會 兄弟

824
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,480
我不再是一個人了

825
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,220
來 見見我的父母

826
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,700
不幸的是 如果我知道你這麼有錢 我肯定早就跟他求婚了

827
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,080
媽 爸 這是弗蘭克和伯尼

828
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,130
歡迎 先生們 很高興見到你們

829
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,100
-謝謝您的邀請 -你真是太好心了

830
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,300
-這是我們的榮幸 -卡門也說他們很好人

831
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,910
冷靜點 小姐

832
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,530
嘿 夥計

833
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,150
哦我的天 發生什麼了

834
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,160
卡爾和他的朋友們

835
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:40,630
厄爾 看到了麼 這只是抓傷而已 沒事 很快會好的

836
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,850
他們是從加利福尼亞過來的兩兄弟伯尼和弗蘭克

837
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,550
-哈羅 -你是？

838
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,770
是的 他是我同父異母的兄弟

839
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,860
我媽媽去做了試管受孕 我覺得慘的是精子

840
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,650
對我來說都是一樣的

841
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,200
不管怎麼說 我們愛羅尼

842
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,330
歡迎 我帶你們去房間

843
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,460
天哪 厄爾

844
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,900
-這間屋子看來管理得當 -不用花很多錢

845
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,340
-為什麼 -這是我們家的財產

846
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:18,050
因為我的外祖父曾在軍中服役 所以政府給我們這座房子

847
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,580
作為黑人農民基金會的一部分

848
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,920
沒人知道我們建了這間屋子

849
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,650
礦產資源 包括油

850
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,810
-...讓我們成為了百萬富翁 -該死的

851
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,800
-爛透了的罪惡 -確實

852
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,940
我希望你們不介意在這個房間裏休息

853
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,980
我們的客人太多 客房都滿了

854
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,850
-我不知道你已經退休了 -哦 是的

855
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,120
我已經退休很久了

856
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,250
甚至連自己是誰都快不知道

857
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,040
所有的用品這裏都用 如果你還需要其他什麼東西...

858
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,200
-請告訴我 不用猶豫 -有特殊服務麼

859
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,910
-要午夜過後才有 -為什麼這麼晚

860
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,010
哥們 我想謝謝你

861
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:20,010
在洛杉磯的時候那麼照顧我女兒

862
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,380
-他對我意義非凡 -卡門是個特別的人

863
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,850
噢不

864
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,300
下午一個小時之內 你必須打扮好

865
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,340
衣櫥有幾件外套

866
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,920
應該合你的尺寸

867
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,160
走吧

868
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,610
-整個城市就在這裏 -你能看得到的

869
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,040
先生們 我能為你們提供一些路易桑那州最好的酒麼

870
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,940
當然

871
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,390
哇 我從沒見過植物飲料

872
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,620
這不是植物 先生 這是仲春

873
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,520
好新鮮

874
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,780
希望你們喜歡

875
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,940
-仲春... -基塔·陶斯

876
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,970
在雜誌上看到過的

877
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,500
你真是太迷人了

878
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,350
我來了 要是沒有某人的勸說 我還脫不開身呢

879
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,030
親愛的 來見見弗蘭克和伯尼

880
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,090
傑弗瑞推薦的

881
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,080
先生們 很榮幸見到你們 弗蘭克 是麼

882
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,440
-很高興見到你 -你一定是「綠色機器」了

883
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,590
是的 很高興見到你 恭喜了

884
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,290
-謝謝 -你擁有了一個完美的女人

885
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,780
我知道 我很幸運

886
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,960
我前世修來的福 太值得了

887
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,860
是不是很有趣

888
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,950
傑弗瑞

889
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,100
有人在喊我

890
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,000
抱歉 先生們

891
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,440
親愛的？

892
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,240
真是個棒小伙

893
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,290
我從未有過這樣的感受 我很開心

894
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,240
他怎麼了

895
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:38,960
-對不起 是我問的 -他在阿富汗出了意外

896
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,460
-他救他朋友的時候 自己出了事 -對不起

897
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,360
沒事

898
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,640
今後我的生活會只剩下三米麼

899
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:08,330
謝謝大家的到來 我想作個小小的演講

900
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,180
對於一個父親來說 看著自己的女兒長大

901
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,460
然後嫁給一個陌生人 是一件痛苦的事

902
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,570
等等

903
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,770
錯了 這是我第一次寫的婚禮致辭

904
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,330
啊 這才是！對於一個父親來說

905
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,090
看著自己的女兒長大

906
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,070
然後嫁給一個陌生人 是一件痛苦的事

907
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,030
帶走他們 然後又歸還

908
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:43,840
當她的丈夫是像傑弗瑞這樣的人 一切又似乎平靜的多

909
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,440
你的媽媽和我希望你得到最好

910
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,380
-讓我們拿起酒杯 -我願意

911
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,260
不幸的是 我希望你們的未來一切順利

912
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,030
永遠快樂 愛情永在

913
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,950
然後 你知道的

914
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,770
-離他遠點 -閉嘴

915
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,670
伯尼

916
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,680
天哪 伯尼 幫幫我

917
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,670
弗蘭克？

918
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,860
弗蘭克？

919
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,000
該死的

920
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,410
你怎麼能睡成這樣

921
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,010
卡門在哪

922
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,000
我等下告訴你

923
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,440
卡門被綁架了

924
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,640
我不知道 我正在睡覺

925
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,550
有人衝進來 帶走了他

926
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,040
我只記得這些 該死的 你怎麼不把他找回來

927
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,430
放輕鬆 這是計劃的一部分

928
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,050
你不明白 他們綁架了我的未婚妻

929
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,800
該死的 弗蘭克叫喊的時候 我們根本沒聽到

930
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,870
-我們到的時候他們已經走了 -我很擔心我的兒子

931
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,580
你有什麼線索麼

932
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,220
當時太黑了 我看不見

933
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,330
他們帶著滑雪面具

934
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,110
-他們訓練有素 -他們有多少人

935
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,980
-八...十 或是更多 -你怎麼可能不知道

936
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,530
可能是因為當時房間裏太多人了

937
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:44,850
-他們襲擊我而你們沒一個人出來幫我 -現在反倒來責怪我？

938
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,750
先生

939
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,010
這有助於我們找回她

940
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:54,080
你必須找到她 這個城市不大

941
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:59,670
維加先生 準確來說 是239139個人

942
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:06,140
-可能還要多一旦 -先生 我想我的任務完成了

943
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,040
我們要建一支隊伍

944
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,110
查看監視器

945
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:20,500
我不想只是在這等著壞消息

946
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,890
我不在乎你花多少錢

947
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,210
你必須把我女兒帶回來

948
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,550
-這不是最佳時間 -有人打電話找卡門

949
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,050
-是他麼 -是的

950
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,640
給我電話

951
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:46,470
摩根先生 廢話不多說 拿五百萬來換你女兒

952
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:51,660
給你32小時 我會再電話通知你見面的地點

953
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,880
如果不照我說的做 就等著見你女兒的屍體吧

954
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,250
或許 黑錢不太好見光的吧

955
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,970
不管是誰做的 這都是計劃好的

956
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,510
你有什麼敵人麼 他們知道你的事麼

957
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:18,730
當然 那些不斷在評估或售賣房子的人

958
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,100
我不敢相信真的發生了這樣的事

959
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,700
她是我的寶貝女 本該在這個星期天結婚

960
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,130
你能幫我們的

961
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,800
這個小城市 很少發生這樣的搶劫案的

962
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,170
而且我知道是曾是個紐約警察

963
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,350
-不完全是 -你能幫我們找到她的

964
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:56,890
-摩根 紐約警察不是經常接這種案子麼 -他們什麼也不會做

965
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,030
他們如此沉迷在自己的判斷裏 以致他們什麼都看不到

966
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,720
我們需要你的幫助

967
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,180
我希望你能帶卡門回來

968
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:11,710
嘿 看看我在門口找到什麼

969
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:18,240
布福德？胭脂俱樂部

970
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,000
雷納德在北門找到的

971
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:29,720
我們可能永遠不會知道 我一直不喜歡這個俱樂部

972
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:34,310
我們會查清楚的 可能會發現線索的 謝謝你 先生

973
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,390
你知道是誰做的 是麼

974
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,260
我告訴你

975
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,220
這裏不是洛杉磯

976
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,120
這裏是巴吞魯日

977
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:51,520
我們的工作方式跟你不同

978
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,210
如果你想插手這個案子

979
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,580
...就算只有一分一毫...

980
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,500
我會把你拷起來 永遠關起來

981
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,680
好好享受你的餘生吧

982
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,380
把這個混蛋抓回來吧

983
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,460
讓我說的清楚點 現在...

984
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,090
-...不要跑 -什麼

985
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,160
不要互相幹架

986
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,790
我不會跟他們走的

987
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,380
你太囉嗦了

988
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,740
我們不再在洛杉磯了

989
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,600
26小時32分

990
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,660
該死的椅子把我屁屁夾住了

991
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,870
把它打成渣

992
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:19,160
好消息是我的鳥還在

993
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,600
嗨 小姐們

994
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,970
來吧

995
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:56,890
最後一次看一堆白人在一圈黑人中間

996
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,720
伯尼 你最好別再做這些事了

997
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:06,080
-見見新朋友啊 -但不是這樣的朋友

998
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,810
換個角度說 我媽媽告訴我 我並不親切待人

999
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,250
哈羅 主人和女主人

1000
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,050
我們想問個問題

1001
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,630
吉列蘭姆 弗蘭克

1002
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,340
我在找布福德先生 你們誰知道他

1003
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,240

1004
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,720

00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,640
呆在這裏

1007
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,710
該死的 混蛋

1008
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:16,430
現在 我再問一遍

1009
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,430
布福德在哪

1010
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,010
我想你不想要這個吧

1011
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:36,740
布福德先生 很高興見到你

1012
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,560
你怎麼不拿張VIP卡呢

1013
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,340
-卡門在哪 -艸

1014
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,130

我不知道 我發誓

1017
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,630
不過我知道

1018
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,560
蘭德裏的閣樓在哪裏

1019
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,160
-閣樓在哪裏 -在這個城市裏

1020
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:12,680
第七大街 這個地方很容易找

1021
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,640
謝謝你的配合

1022
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,550
羅尼？你怎麼樣 我的朋友

1023
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,800
-我可能會遲點到 -我明白

1024
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,080
大忙人 很多活動

1025
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,800
我瞭解

1026
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,540
我以朋友的身份想請你幫忙 我的車在車庫裏

1027
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,000
所以我能借你的車用一個星期麼

1028
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,900
我的車？

1029
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,110
這個星期...

1030
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:11,810
我哥要來 然後我要去接她

1031
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:17,480
哦是的 我明白

1032
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:23,200
聽著 把車借我 或者是我砸了它

1033
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,170
你自己選吧

1034
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,880
嘿...你要去哪裏？

1035
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,980
-是的 我們走丟了 -好吧

1036
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,180
如果你不我走 我不會奢求你什麼東西的

1037
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,040
所以 你想成為主人？

1038
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,520
我們拿走你的鞋 讓你的腳變冷

1039
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,420
聽著 呆子

1040
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:42,670
如果你能跑掉 你會覺得這是個錯誤的選擇麼

1041
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,260
好吧

1042
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,410
吃點東西吧

1043
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:11,330
老傢伙抓到布福德了

1044
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:19,130
-你能出來一下麼 -好

1045
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,890
你怎麼會把老傢伙跟丟了

1046
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:38,630
-我不知道發生了什麼 -我告訴他們別搞砸了

1047
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,480
20小時16分

1048
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,290
為什麼我總是那個坐在好位置上的人

1049
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,140
而且還總是有美女相伴

1050
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,570
你在說什麼 不是所有的女人都是漂亮的

1051
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:27,180
哈羅 小姐 我們想見見蘭德裏

1052
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,900
-他住在這麼 他已經搬走了

1053
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,800
所以 請走吧

1054
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,400
你能告訴我們去哪能找到他麼

1055
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,600
-把你的臭腳拿開 -說吧 小姐

1056
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,660
你不用...

1057
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,880
-我覺得他不會攻擊的 -堅持住

1058
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,270
沒必要用暴力啦 我們只是想跟你談談而已

1059
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,080
我們不是那種會打女人的男人啦

1060
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:08,800
-現在跟我們說吧 蘭德裏在哪

1061
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,520
離我遠點

1062
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,620
只要你告訴我蘭德裏在哪

1063
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:24,310
-他在哪 -他在貝克斯那裏工作

1064
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,880
城外的燒烤店

1065
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,770
早上通常在那 現在你們可以走了

1066
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:34,960
這麼快就放棄？我還以為我們能再談談呢

1067
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,010
你踢了我的肋骨啊

1068
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,050
鼻子流血了？

1069
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:08,640
怎麼樣了 很高興找到你

1070
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,720
看 卡爾

1071
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,830

1072
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,910
-我沒有 -我以為你有

1073
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,330
不 真的 我沒有錢

1074
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:31,330
給我 在我打你之前

1075
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,710
好吧

1076
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,870
你怎麼不去工作

1077
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:46,410
-你是誰 -羅納德的朋友

1078
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,800
我認為你該去找份工作

1079
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,930
你向祖父母抱怨 讓他們來保護你？

1080
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,850
你難道不需要有人照顧麼

1081
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,540
我勸你離開 在...

1082
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,440
-卡爾 -什麼

1083
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,270
他們是一夥的

1084
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:09,550
-什麼 -銀行搶劫案

1085
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:15,330
-該死的 哇 我們是你的粉絲 -卡爾

1086
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,340
-爸爸 -發生什麼事了

1087
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,050
沒 只是跟羅尼和「大壞蛋」聊天而已

1088
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,900
-你知道他們 是麼 -恩 我見過

1089
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,630
女士們

1090
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:28,930
你媽讓我們六點前回到家 我們要走了

1091
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,240
拜拜 哥們

1092
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,200
拜拜

1093
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:48,900
我很欣賞你所做的 不過別惹出亂子

1094
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:53,000
我不想面臨暴力和威脅

1095
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,710
放聰明點

1096
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,820
有很多防衛的方法

1097
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:02,620
-你覺得什麼是智慧 -是啊

1098
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,920
無意冒犯 但我不讚賞你的戰術

1099
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,050
-有更好的方法來解決這個問題 -說說看

1100
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:17,100
你是當過兵的人 現在怎麼變的這麼鬆懈了

1101
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,090
如果你跟我見多同樣的風景

1102
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,410
我不想表現的暴力

1103
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,160
-傑弗瑞 -你怎麼樣

1104
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,010
嗨 各位

1105
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:34,450
-我不敢相信這真的發生了 -我們會處理的 傑夫

1106
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:37,980
我一直在想原因是什麼

1107
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,480
冷靜點 兄弟 你幹嘛不睡

1108
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,220
你覺得我能睡覺？

1109
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,170
這是什麼

1110
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:17,610
對不起 停車的時候我走過草地

1111
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:21,280
出於某些你不喜歡的原因

1112
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,280
一切都太安靜了

1113
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:30,180
我無法把我知道的那些準確的表達出來

1114
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:33,780
看起來警察沒辦法處理這個案子 是麼

1115
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,520
每一步行動都是以抓捕兇手為目的

1116
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:42,080
-放屁 -對不起

1117
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:46,580
你們作為正義的代表 受到了蔑視

1118
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,670
聽著 維加先生 我完全支持你的行動

1119
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:54,590
不要疑惑

1120
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:57,590
讓我們專心做事 好麼

1121
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:13,660
朱麗葉想跟弗蘭克叔叔打枕頭戰 我希望你能來

1122
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,840
-我們能談談麼 -當然

1123
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,120

1124
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:25,040
我想感謝你的幫助

1125
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,420
沒事

1126
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,320
只想讓他們明白而已

1127
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,040
我希望你能收下這個

1128
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,890
這是我爸爸的

1129
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,870
他帶著它上戰場

1130
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,440
純鈦 是護身符來著

1131
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,460
你還能看到單孔

1132
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,570
-很棒 但我不能收下 -請收下吧

1133
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,960
我想把它給你

1134
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,900
謝謝

1135
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,950
如果你能...

1136
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:13,210
-我能問你些事麼 -當然

1137
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:19,070
你是...英雄麼

1138
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,950
我不知道

1139
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:26,830
我也想知道我到底是

1140
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:33,140
還是不是 -放手去做吧

1141
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,590
做自己

1142
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,380
做出正確的選擇

1143
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:44,650
有什麼能阻止？？

1144
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:47,220
和睡意

1145
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,000
4小時41分

1146
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:10,440
-你摸鼻子摸了多久了 -我沒數啊

1147
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,460
-南部父母的習慣

1148
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,060
好吧

1149
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:39,440
我答應 如果我離開這 我會去找傑尼·克拉格

1150
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,630
密碼？

1151
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,750
「長鬍子」

1152
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,870
「月光」

1153
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,910
這需要更多胡椒 放多點

1154
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:24,250
-好了 -我們還有什麼

1155
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,150
還行 還能再下多點胡椒 謝謝

1156
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,360
你把這裏搞亂了 白癡

1157
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,050
你在叫誰白癡 你這個白癡

1158
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:45,710
-你是誰 -卡門在哪

1159
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,240
你沒回答我的問題 卡門在哪

1160
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,250
我就要跟他的侄子結婚了

1161
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,150
該死的

1162
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:09,790
哈羅 1988

1163
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:19,130
好吧 誰要先受死

1164
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:59,250
給我下地獄吧

1165
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:07,970
卡門在哪

1166
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:09,870
-艸 -好吧

1167
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:12,050
不 不

1168
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,200
我告訴你 停下

1169
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:20,420
她在一座老房子裏

1170
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,780
我去拿我的錢包和車

1171
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,430
你永遠不會原諒你自己的 混蛋

1172
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:51,120
-這個門... -離開這

1173
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:05,230
帶我去見哈里森

1174
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,210
輸入你的目標

1175
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:21,960
我希望這個大鬍子是個好人

1176
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:27,580
要怎麼回退 什麼

1177
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,260
我輸入了錯誤的地址 不知道怎麼刪除它

1178
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,320
試試點擊「刪除」

1179
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,800
-按鈕在哪 -在「鍵盤」上

1180
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:44,670
我不再需要幫助了

1181
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:01,260
謝天謝地 我們都不知道我們在哪了

1182
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,160
慢慢舉起你的手

1183
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:07,730
-等等 什麼 -閉嘴 把手舉起來

1184
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:23,620
再見 很高興見到你們

1185
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:30,880
我想跟你說 這不是最安全的地方

1186
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,880
這個該死的小孩

1187
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,950
試試看

1188
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,410
什麼事

1189
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:01,660
來吧 他們不想幫我們

1190
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,910
早上好 維加先生

1191
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,010
-你要帶我們去哪 -這是驚喜

1192
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,440
但是我想說...這風景真是特別呢

1193
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:22,650
我想說...

1194
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,080
我已經告訴過你別插手了 但你沒聽

1195
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,850
這次你該嘗嘗後果了

1196
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:35,050
聽著 我們會給你最後一次機會

1197
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:41,310
別讓我殺你 如果這已經完成了

1198
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,480
無風不起浪 知道麼 哥們 誘餌已經放置好了

1199
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:51,790
-...然後你就被抓了 -你跑不掉的

1200
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:56,740
我是首席警官 我代表著正義

1201
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:05,910
我們有一大段路要走了 先生們

1202
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:12,720
你會在墓地找到安寧的

1203
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,520
希望你「旅途愉快」

1204
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,780
艸

1205
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,280
24秒

1206
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:50,460
-哈羅？ -在第六碼頭等我們

1207
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:53,110
讓你老婆一個人帶著錢來

1208
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:57,370
如果有其他人在場...你就等著給你女兒收屍吧

1209
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:00,180
等等 喂

1210
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,580
打擾一下 我在找捨福瑞·布朗薩德

1211
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,480
-他20分鐘後回來 -我等他

1212
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,990
你想玩牌麼

1213
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,680
我們三個一起

1214
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:57,030
-我不知道要怎麼離開這 -沒收他們的降落傘

1215
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,760
哦 該死的

1216
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:09,670
-伯尼 你還好麼 -感覺不太好

1217
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:11,820
他需要幫忙 哥們

1218
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,140
他做過肝移植手術 現在身體產生排斥

1219
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,220
如果你不做點什麼 他會咬斷自己的舌頭的

1220
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,090
哦 艸

1221
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:24,360
快來 我需要你的幫忙

1222
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:02,770
晚上好 我的朋友們

1223
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:11,370
很好

1224
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:16,580
-我要怎麼飛 -我看過幾百遍「壯志凌雲」

1225
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,210
我們要先想想怎麼降落

1226
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:28,740
看看抽屜裏有沒有操作手冊

1227
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:32,350
儲物箱？這不是你老爸的車

1228
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,960
我試過了

1229
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:43,790
嘿...嘿 天啊 維加 別草率行動

1230
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,110
你是個好孩子

1231
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,180
我們要降落這架飛機

1232
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:59,200
我覺得你要升高一點

1233
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:01,580
我也不太懂

1234
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,190
-這行不懂 哥們 -我打算試試別的方法

1235
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:10,760
弗蘭克 試試別的 可能會成功

1236
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,210
-該死的 -該死

1237
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:08,770
-該死

1238
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:24,040
你還沒上過駕校 我們什麼都做不了的

1239
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:13,320
感謝達成墨西哥航空

1240
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:51,710
沒有信號了

1241
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:55,630
我們在某個地方的中間 離降落點至少還有70公里

1242
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:59,330
-你要幹什麼 -我想尋求幫助

1243
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:03,610
-你好好呆在哪 -你不能 哥們

1244
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:06,370
如果別人說我們是鱷魚和狼人怎麼辦

1245
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:08,270
好吧 等著

1246
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:14,320
伯尼 我沒時間去處理這件屁事 你只能來 或者是不來

1247
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,550
不能兩件事都做

1248
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:21,110
這是什麼

1249
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,590
這是什麼

1250
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:20,380
不管你是在洛杉磯或是其他地方 我們都在做著些什麼

1251
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,840
我們現在怎麼做

1252
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,200
穿過路邊

1253
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:04,440
我看到很多守衛 我們怎麼去那裏

1254
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:08,380
你怎麼總是說不完 我會解決的

1255
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:17,970
-你在做什麼 -我的隱形眼睛掉了

1256
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:25,610
我找到了

1257
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,780
哦 我的天

1258
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:33,230
走吧

1259
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:35,830
別動 混蛋

1260
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,010
我知道你 你就是那個大傢伙 對吧

1261
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:47,990
-是的 -我們是一夥的

1262
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:50,780
你們實在太驚人了

1263
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:53,520
-謝謝你 兄弟 -我很欣賞

1264
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:57,220
你有很多粉絲

1265
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:59,850
不幸的是 我不得殺了你

1266
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,650
-拜託 -什麼

1267
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:03,550
摧毀你

1268
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,560
-現在 你就要死了 -聽著...

1269
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:09,040
你根本不需要殺了我們四個

1270
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:12,240
對不起 我的朋友 這是我的工作

1271
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,450
長眠吧 混蛋

1272
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:25,390
-你腦子怎麼了 厄爾？ -見鬼的腦子

1273
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:29,230
把我女兒救出來吧

1274
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,840
你有方法麼

1275
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:55,230
給你

1276
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:49,150
我們怎麼知道他在哪

1277
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:55,060
我們會找到的

1278
01:03:56,310 --> 01:04:00,520
-有問題麼 -沒有

1279
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:07,230
走吧

1280
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:11,800
該死的 厄爾

1281
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:24,670
-好了 時間到了 夥計 -你知道的 他太會惹事了

1282
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:28,750
-老爸 你在這幹嘛 -你還好麼

1283
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,410
我們要走了

1284
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:33,310
必須走了

1285
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:38,510
去抓這個混蛋

1286
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:14,080
你會像個婊子一樣麼

1287
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:20,230
真是令人印象深刻 放下你的槍

1288
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:24,090
把槍放下

1289
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:32,110
-你在幹嘛 傑弗瑞 -我知道你肯定想不通

1290
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,590
事實是...

1291
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:37,630
...在你倆來之前 計劃進行的很順利

1292
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:41,450
傑弗瑞 如果你想騙我們 應該一開始就跟我們說

1293
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:44,580
在我父親簽那張支票之前

1294
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:47,390
我一直很幽默

1295
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:51,410
把他的槍拿下

1296
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:55,850
沒有人想傷害她 除非某人想成為英雄

1297
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,050
去另一個房間

1298
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:02,870
現在！

1299
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:09,160
你也走

1300
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:12,460
你是誰

1301
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:20,050
你根本沒想跟她結婚 對吧

1302
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:25,480
她是個非凡的女人 如果境地不同...誰知道呢...

1303
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:31,420
但這是個能跟我的侄子一起分享的商業機遇

1304
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:35,550
侄子？首席警官布羅薩德？

1305
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,640
也是同謀

1306
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:39,980
是的 維加先生

1307
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:45,250
把我女兒還給我 我把贖金給你

1308
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:47,700
我很想相信你

1309
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:53,520
可是我不信你 我們為卡門準備了一個大計劃

1310
01:07:54,790 --> 01:07:56,590
混蛋

1311
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:59,660
冷靜 厄爾

1312
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,100
他們等下會被逮捕的

1313
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,970
我很懷疑啊 維加先生

1314
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:10,390
所有的一切都不會發生

1315
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,700
再見了

1316
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:19,420
盧卡斯

1317
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:22,640
我們走

1318
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:29,730
噢 該死的

1319
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:35,270
我今晚想吃燒烤

1320
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,060
-...撒上美乃滋 -哦 這個骨頭很強壯

1321
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:43,730
來吧 我們還有一些事沒處理呢

1322
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:45,810
我的手被綁住了

1323
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:49,620
我們被困住了 出不去了

1324
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:56,600
「我們去路易桑那吧」

1325
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:01,120
「去放放鬆」

1326
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:05,660
-你在怪我 是麼 -當然是你的錯

1327
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,630
就不能是你的錯麼

1328
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:13,860
如果不是為了你 我們才不會在這裏 夠了

1329
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:17,040
你就不能安靜的走麼

1330
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:27,650
對不起 爸爸

1331
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,680
真是愉快的旅程

1332
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:36,560
-是的 -我也覺得

1333
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:56,800
-你想去兜風麼 -當然

1334
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,320
走吧

1335
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,640
我覺得很尷尬 你是我的孩子啊

1336
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:36,790
我救了你們

1337
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:38,390
你怎麼知道我們在那

1338
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:41,290
我沒有辦法 只能躲在卡車裏

1339
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:47,120
在你媽來交易之前 我們還有22分鐘離開

1340
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:50,470
22分鐘 離開這裏至少要45分鐘吧

1341
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:52,640
大踩油門 孩子

1342
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:59,940
他們有人

1343
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:04,100
-我們需要援助 -羅納德 帶上你的手機

1344
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:39,040
-傑弗瑞？ -哈羅 女士

1345
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,950
我知道你肯定想不到

1346
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:46,880
給我錢 然後我給你們卡門

1347
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:53,720
你...你 見鬼 你這骯髒的豬頭

1348
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:59,270
-把錢給我 -艸

1349
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:09,510
我欣賞你的勇氣 但是在這裏派不上用場

1350
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:14,450
你把卡門給我 不然我什麼都不會給你的

1351
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,690
如你所想

1352
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:38,730
現在 我要揍扁你

1353
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:47,470
走吧 親愛的

1354
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:50,930
是你

1355
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:53,280
好了 親愛的

1356
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:59,470
終於救了她的 我就知道

1357
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:05,110
路易桑那的警察終於到了

1358
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:15,060
舉起你的手

1359
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:25,260
天哪 傑弗瑞

1360
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:29,990
怎麼能發生這樣的事呢

1361
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,880
混蛋

1362
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,660
這是我的

1363
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,760
維加先生

1364
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:49,700
你幾乎搞砸了這一切

1365
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:54,470
現在 你們都要去死

1366
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,740
從你開始

1367
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:02,810
混蛋

1368
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:05,350
別動

1369
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:08,150
放下槍 布羅薩德

1370
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:11,150
你在幹什麼

1371
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,760
一切都結束了 把槍放下

1372
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:17,790
你是在跟...

1373
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:24,740
...一個更危險的人玩火 如果我是你...

1374
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:27,200
...我就乖乖回家

1375
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,110
把孩子帶走

1376
01:15:30,210 --> 01:15:32,140
放下槍 布羅薩德

1377
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,980
舉起你的手 現在!

1378
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:39,330
別逞能了

1379
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:42,970
我勸你退下

1380
01:15:43,730 --> 01:15:45,540
因為我要殺了他

1381

只剩一小時來救你命了

1388

我的感謝已無法用言語表達了

1402

我想做的盡可能簡單點

1413
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:51,590
我會為整場手術買單的

1414
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,440
而你也會有收穫的

1415
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:59,150
你不用擔心錢的問題 特別是買藥的錢

01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:21,510
很快了...

1421
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:25,860
大壞蛋要到曼谷啦

1422
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,770
嘿 伯尼 你能成為更好的自己
