160
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:13,743
and ask for my movie check.

161
00:06:13,786 --> 00:06:17,017
Shit, yeah.
We gots to get paid.

162
00:06:17,056 --> 00:06:19,456
And on that note,
we cue the music.

163
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:22,655
-Mat mat mat
-L-L-lum

164
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:24,629
-Mat mat mat
-Lip la

165
00:06:24,664 --> 00:06:26,791
-Mat mat mat
-L-L-lum

166
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,597
-Mat mat meal
-Ma ma ma, ma ma-ma ma

167
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:36,703
Well...

168
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:40,110
look at these morose
motherfuckers right here.

169
00:06:40,146 --> 00:06:42,944
Smells like somebody
shit in their cereal.

170
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:45,678
Bung! Ha ha ha!

171
00:06:45,718 --> 00:06:47,549
That was good.
Come on in.

172
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:49,817
So, what brings
you two dirt merchants...

173
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:51,483
to my neck of the woods?

174
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:53,856
l'll tell you what our necks
are doing in your woods.

175
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:56,020
Where's our motherfucking
movie check?

176
00:06:56,062 --> 00:06:58,360
You heard about that, huh?
l got nothing to do with it.

177
00:06:58,398 --> 00:06:59,922
That's Banky's deal.
He owns the property now.

178
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:01,433
l sold my half of the "Bluntman
and Chronic" rights...

179
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:02,627
to him years ago.

180
00:07:02,668 --> 00:07:05,136
Why the fuck would you
do a thing like that?

181
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:07,332
Why in God's name
would l wanna keep writing...

182
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:10,001
about characters whose
central preoccupation...

183
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:12,341
is weed
and dick and fart jokes?

184
00:07:12,378 --> 00:07:14,903
l mean, you got to grow, man.

185
00:07:14,947 --> 00:07:16,972
Don't you ever want
anything more for yourself?

186
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:20,048
l know this poor hapless
son of a bitch does.

187
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:22,111
l look into his
sorry doe eyes...

188
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:24,555
and ljust--
l see a man crying out.

189
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,955
He's crying out, "When, Lord?

190
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:28,620
"When the fuck
can your servant...

191
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:31,289
"ditch this foul-mouthed
little chucklehead...

192
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,060
"to whom l am a constant
victim of his folly...

193
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,260
"so much so that
it prevents him...

194
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:36,461
"from ever getting
to kiss a girl?

195
00:07:36,502 --> 00:07:37,992
"Fuck! When, Lord, when?

196
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:39,766
"When's gonna be my time?"

197
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:44,709
He knows.

198
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:47,577
l'm the chucklehead?
You're the fucking dumb-ass...

199
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:49,604
who gave your comic away,
and now you don't get...

200
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:51,378
no fucking movie check,
neither.

201
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:52,577
When you're right,
you're right.

202
00:07:52,618 --> 00:07:54,313
l wish l held onto
a little piece of that thing...

203
00:07:54,353 --> 00:07:55,911
because if the buzz
is any indicator...

204
00:07:55,955 --> 00:07:58,253
that movie's going
to make some huge bank.

205
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,849
What buzz?

206
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:01,086
The lnternet buzz.

207
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:03,459
What the fuck is the lnternet?

208
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:05,225
The lnternet
is a communications tool...

209
00:08:05,264 --> 00:08:07,323
used the world over, where
people can come together...

210
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:09,834
to bitch about movies and share
pornography with one another.

211
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:12,235
Here's what we're looking for--
Moviepoopshoot.com. [Farts]

212
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:14,762
Poop shoot. Yeah.

213
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:17,640
This is a site populated
by militant movie buffs--

214
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:19,508
sad, pathetic little bastards...

215
00:08:19,545 --> 00:08:21,069
living in their
parents' basement...

216
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:22,342
downloading scripts...

217
00:08:22,381 --> 00:08:24,542
and what they think
is inside information...

218
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:27,109
about movies and actors
they claim to despise...

219
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:28,484
yet can't stop discussing.

220
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:31,649
OK, this is about "Bluntman
and Chronic" right here.

221
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:32,851
"lnside sources tell me...

222
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:34,325
"Miramax is starting
production this Friday...

223
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,918
"on their adaptation
of underground comic fave...

224
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:37,486
"'Bluntman and Chronic."'

225
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,225
Friday? Shit, does it say
who's fucking playing us...

226
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:40,425
in the movie?

227
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:41,626
No, but it's Miramax...

228
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,601
so l'm sure it'll be
Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.

229
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:45,467
You know, they put them
in a bunch of movies.

230
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:46,870
Who?

231
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:48,339
You know, those kids
from "Good Will Hunting."

232
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:51,002
You mean that fucking movie
with Mork from Ork in it?

233
00:08:51,043 --> 00:08:52,567
Yeah, l wasn't
a big fan, either...

234
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:55,240
but Affleck was the bomb
in "Phantoms."

235
00:08:55,281 --> 00:08:57,772
Word, bitch. "Phantoms"'
like a motherfucker.

236
00:08:57,817 --> 00:08:58,977
What's up now?

237
00:08:59,018 --> 00:09:00,542
[Cracks neck]
Ahem. All right.

238
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:03,282
So, here we go. Now, this
is the shoot-back section.

239
00:09:03,322 --> 00:09:04,755
This is where the people
who read the news...

240
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,655
get to chime in
with their two cents.

241
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:08,057
For example,
we got a guy here...

242
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:10,995
with the chick magnet
net handle "Wompa One"...

243
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,294
opining on what he thinks
about "Bluntman and Chronic. "

244
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:16,130
He says, "Bluntman and Chronic
and their stupid alter egos...

245
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:18,433
"Jay and Silent Bob only work
in small doses, if at all.

246
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:20,496
"They don't deserve
their own movie. "

247
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,132
-He's got a point.
-Fuck him.

248
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,335
What's the next one say?

249
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:25,640
This is entitled "Fuck Them
Up Their Stupid Asses."

250
00:09:25,678 --> 00:09:28,340
"'Bluntman and Chronic' is
the worst comic l ever read.

251
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:30,349
"Jay and Silent Bob
are stupid characters--

252
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:32,908
"a couple of stoners who spout
dumb-ass catch phrases...

253
00:09:32,952 --> 00:09:34,476
"like a third-rate
Cheech and Chong...

254
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,112
"or Bill and Ted.

255
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:37,622
"Fuck Jay and Silent Bob.

"Fuck them
up their stupid asses."

257
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:42,661
Who the fuck said that shit?

258
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:44,322
A guy who calls himself
"Magnolia Fan."

259
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:45,557
All right, here,
check this one out.

260
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:47,532
"Jay and Silent Bob
are one-notejokes...

261
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:49,535
"that only stoners laugh at.

262
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:52,538
"They're fucking clown shoes."
Mmm.

263
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:54,403
"lf they were real, l'd beat
the shit out of them...

264

"for being so stupid.

265
00:09:56,008 --> 00:09:57,839
"l, for one, will be
boycotting this movie.

266
00:09:57,877 --> 00:09:59,037
"Who's with me?"

267
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:00,568
Then there's, like,
fifty more posts...

268
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:03,411
of people who are joining
Spartacus's here boycott.

00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:06,009
l'm gonna kill all these fucks.

270
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:08,350
Let it go, man. They're
not talking about you guys.

271
00:10:08,387 --> 00:10:10,821
They're talking about
Bluntman and Chronic.

272
00:10:10,856 --> 00:10:15,054
They said Jay and Silent Bob.
They used our real names.

273
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:17,028
lt doesn't matter if there's
a comic book version of us...

274
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:18,223
and a real version...

275
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:20,425
because no one knows
we're real in real life.

276
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:21,728
Really?

277
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:22,893
All these people
reading that shit...

278
00:10:22,935 --> 00:10:24,095
think the real
Jay and Silent Bob...

279
00:10:24,136 --> 00:10:25,296
are a couple jerkoffs...

280
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:26,737
because of what all
these dickheads are writing...

281
00:10:26,772 --> 00:10:28,740
about the comic book
Jay and Silent Bob.

282
00:10:28,774 --> 00:10:30,969
Maybe one night
me and Lunch Box are out...

283
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,069
we're mackin' some chick
and shit, and she's, like...

284
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:36,047
"Ooh, l wanna suck
youse guys' dicks off"...

285
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:38,107
and she's, like,
"What's your names?"

286
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,708
And l'm, like,
"Jay and Silent Bob."

287
00:10:39,752 --> 00:10:40,980
Reco'nize.

288
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,851
And she's like, "Oh,
l've read on the lnternet...

289
00:10:42,888 --> 00:10:44,185
"that fuckin' youse guys...

"are a couple of little
fuckin' jerkoffs."

291
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:49,455
And then she goes and sucks two
other guys' dicks off instead.

292
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:52,055
Well, fuck that.
We gotta put a stop...

293
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:53,725
to these fuckin' hateful
sons of bitches...

294
00:10:53,766 --> 00:10:55,927
before they ruin our good names.

295
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:57,902
First of all, l don't know
how good your names are.

296
00:10:57,937 --> 00:10:59,370
Second of all, there's
not much you can do...

297
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:00,599
about stopping this bile.

298
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,699
The lnternet has given
everyone in America a voice...

299
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:04,141
and evidently, everyone
in America has chosen...

300
00:11:04,176 --> 00:11:05,871
to use that voice
to bitch about movies.

301
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:07,902
As long as there's a "Bluntman
and Chronic" movie...

302
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:09,380
the net nerds are gonna
have something negative...

303
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:10,575
to say about it.

304
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:11,878
Well, wait a second.

305
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:14,215
lf there wasn't a "Bluntman
and Chronic" movie...

306
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:16,016
then those fuckers
wouldn't be saying shit...

307
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:17,818
about Jay and Silent Bob,
right?

308
00:11:17,857 --> 00:11:20,348
They're not saying
anything about you now, OK?

309
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:22,486
They're talking about
fictional characters.

310
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:25,292
Fictional characters.

311
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:27,322
Am l--am l getting
through to you at all?

312
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:29,527
So all we gotta do is go stop...

for likeness rights...

1849
01:26:26,628 --> 01:26:28,687
and as we're not only
the artistic basis...

1850
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:30,698
but also, obviously,
the character basis...

for your intellectual property,
"Bluntman and Chronic"...

1852
01:26:33,535 --> 01:26:36,368
when said property was optioned
by Miramax Films...

1853
01:26:36,404 --> 01:26:39,396
you were legally obliged
to secure our permission...

to transfer the concept
to another medium.

Holy shit, the cops.
We gotta get out of here.

No, no, no.

Oh, Marshal.
Hey, you awake?

Wake up, Marshal.

1888

-Oh.
-Are you OK?

1889

Oh, my God, l'm paralyzed!

1890
01:28:17,071 --> 01:28:20,234
That monkey shot me in the ass
and paralyzed me!

Oh, sweet irony!

You're not paralyzed.
lt was just a tranquilizer.

Oh, Jesus! Ow!

Uh-huh. They all made it in,
but l failed the exam.

What kind of deal?

1906
01:28:54,809 --> 01:28:57,300
You get the charges dropped
against Jay and Silent Bob...

1907
01:28:57,345 --> 01:28:58,812
and say
you never found the ape.

the diamonds we stole...

Sissy, and myself.

But l want a reduced sentence.

1911

You'd be willing to do that?

For him,
l'd be willing to do anything.

l'm an international jewel thief
who's facing a jail sentence.

you got your own monkey.

from Jersey possibly want?

There's not much
you can do to stop that.

and beating the shit
out of them, l guess.

we're making, man...

Judi Dench played me.

that restraining order.

-Tell 'em, Steve-Dave.
-Would you stop saying that?

1986

Well...that was just another
paean to male adolescence...

1987
01:33:09,664 --> 01:33:11,632
and its refusal to grow up.

1988

Yeah, sis, but it was
better than "Mallrats."

1989
01:33:14,168 --> 01:33:15,863
At least Holden
had the good sense...

1990
01:33:15,903 --> 01:33:17,302
to keep his name off of it.

1991
01:33:17,338 --> 01:33:20,865
Why wouldn't Miramax option
his other comic instead...

1992
01:33:20,908 --> 01:33:24,139
the one with you and him
and your "relationship"?

1993
01:33:24,178 --> 01:33:28,080
What, "Chasing Amy"?
That'd never work as a movie.

"Batman and Robin" again.
