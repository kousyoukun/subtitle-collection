1
00:00:54,864 --> 00:00:56,999
I know. It's really,
really stupid.

2
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:01,904
The rules say, oh, you can't
have bra straps showing.

3
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,574
I think it's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

4
00:01:08,077 --> 00:01:09,011
Right?

5
00:01:10,412 --> 00:01:12,747
Like, no bra straps?
What's with that?

6
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:15,718
Yes, thank you! I know.

7
00:01:16,753 --> 00:01:17,918
- You don't look ready to go.
- Stop it!

8
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,921
Two minutes!

9
00:01:19,922 --> 00:01:21,454
Oh, I've got an unbelievably
busy day today.

10
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:25,092
I'm meeting Roxy for coffee at nine,
and then I've got five houses to show.

11
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:29,832
Everybody wants to sell,
but who can afford to buy at these prices?

12
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:35,002
Hmm.

13
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:36,636
- It's yummy.
- Hmm.

14
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,974
I'm trying to unclog your heart.

15
00:01:38,573 --> 00:01:39,541
My heart is not clogged.

16
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:42,408
You eat like a teenager.

17
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,576
Let's face facts.

18
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:44,812
Oh, come here.

19
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:46,548
It's time for you to face facts.

20
00:01:47,116 --> 00:01:47,984
Okay?

21
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:50,718
Face it.

22
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,287
Louise!

23
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:54,556
Hmm, you smell great.

24
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:56,857
It's that perfume you
got me for my birthday.

25
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:58,060
Oh, yeah? Good for me.

26
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,430
Oh.

27
00:02:03,465 --> 00:02:05,431
All right. Let's go. Backpack.

28
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:06,801
Okay, I'm getting it.

29
00:02:06,803 --> 00:02:08,702
- Will you take these, please?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:08,704 --> 00:02:09,638
Okay.

31
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,438
Bye.

32
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,010
Hey, Louise, laces.

33
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:35,597
Goodbye to you.

34
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,935
Yuck.

35
00:02:50,012 --> 00:02:50,980
Hello.

36
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:52,915
Amigo!

37
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:57,952
Rob's Cafe, yes, yes.
You read my mind.

38
00:02:57,954 --> 00:02:59,621
Could you give me
like a half an hour?

39
00:03:00,622 --> 00:03:03,858
Yeah, order me, I don't
know, the No. 2 special,

40
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,026
over-easy bacon on the side,
and you know what?

41
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:09,697
While you're at it, why don't you throw in
a neat little stack of buttermilk pancakes?

42
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:10,831
How about that?

43
00:03:41,197 --> 00:03:42,229
Oh, hey.

44
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:43,529
Hi.

45
00:03:43,531 --> 00:03:45,567
Oh, hey.

46
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:48,202
- You look amazing.
- Thanks.

47
00:03:48,204 --> 00:03:49,638
Did you do something
to your hair?

48
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,105
I washed it.

49
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:52,505
Hmm, looks really good.

50
00:03:52,507 --> 00:03:54,143
- Thank you.
- So,

51
00:03:55,044 --> 00:03:55,945
can you tell?

52
00:03:59,648 --> 00:04:01,581
I'm pregnant.

53
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,119
Oh, my God!

54
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:09,890
I couldn't say anything until I was at least 12
weeks along but I finally heard the heartbeat.

55
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:12,159
Oh, my God! That's so exciting.

56
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:14,663
Actually, I should
say heartbeats.

57
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:16,764
Twins?

58
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:17,698
Triplets.

59
00:04:18,768 --> 00:04:21,268
I know! I know! I know! I
know! Oh, my God! Okay.

60
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,238
I mean, I knew... I knew this was a
possibility because of the fertility drugs,

61
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,943
but Nicky is shitting bricks.

62
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:29,076
Therapist has to work
to calm him down.

63
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:30,911
Oh, I didn't know
you saw a therapist.

64
00:04:30,913 --> 00:04:33,047
Ah, triplets,
I can't believe it.

65
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:34,782
I'm gonna have a
house full of kids.

66
00:04:34,784 --> 00:04:37,084
I only going to have to
wreck my body one time.

67
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:38,953
I mean, I'm just...
I'm over the moon.

68
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:40,254
I've already hired
a nursery designer.

69
00:04:40,256 --> 00:04:41,188
Is it helping?

70
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,723
Oh, God, I'm buying
everything in sight.

71
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:44,091
No, I mean, the therapist.

72
00:04:44,093 --> 00:04:46,260
Why? You guys don't go?

73
00:04:46,262 --> 00:04:49,964
No, but I think maybe we should.

74
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:50,931
Problems?

75
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:53,267
It's mostly just money stuff.

76
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:54,835
That's why I think I
need to get a new job.

77
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:57,037
No, no, honey, you are married.

78
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:59,073
It is the man's job
to make the money.

79
00:04:59,075 --> 00:05:00,007
Yeah, Bob doesn't care.

80
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:02,745
He's fine with things
the way they are.

81
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:06,481
He better care if he wants
to stay married to you.

82
00:05:16,993 --> 00:05:19,559
All right. Just play it half
speed from right here.

83
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:22,830
That's good. All right. So, now,
let's keep... it's after this, time right,

84
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:24,597
okay, stop, pause,
see? Right there.

85
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:29,703
Do you see it? Run it back frame by frame,
frame by frame, slowly, a little bit further,

86
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:32,973
and right there.
Look, they're dancing.

87
00:05:32,975 --> 00:05:34,308
See it? Polar bears dancing.

88
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,211
Yeah. Ha? That's our cover.

89
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:39,046
That's our cover. Print
that image. That's great.

90
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,183
You must be
so happy. That's great.

91
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:44,051
But... but back...
back to the house.

92
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:47,021
So, Larry, I mean, I think it
checks all the boxes, right?

93
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:49,857
It... it, you know, it's got
the-the pool, the Jacuzzi,

94
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:52,228
yeah, and it's great
for entertaining.

95
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:54,263
Oh, can you hold on one second?

96
00:05:55,597 --> 00:05:57,833
Larry, I need one second.
I'll be right back.

97
00:05:58,968 --> 00:05:59,869
Hi.

98
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:01,835
Yeah.

99
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:05,007
No, no, I'm... I'm... I'm waiting
right here for you. Yeah.

100
00:06:07,143 --> 00:06:11,247
Uh, no, I can't come
back at seven tonight.

101
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,687
No, no, no, no, it's fine. These things
happen. We... we'll reschedule it.

102
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:21,123
You have a great audition, okay?

103
00:06:21,991 --> 00:06:23,625
Good luck! Bye.

104
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:28,896
Larry, it's me, I'm back.
Thanks for holding. Okay.

105
00:06:28,898 --> 00:06:32,600
I think that if you want the house,
you're gonna have to make an offer.

106
00:06:34,703 --> 00:06:35,704
Hello, Larry?

107
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,915
Ugh!

108
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,952
- I hate real estate.
- Uh-oh.

109
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,390
- What the heck!
- It will get better.

110
00:06:56,392 --> 00:06:58,692
I don't know, maybe
it's just a midlife thing.

111
00:06:58,694 --> 00:07:00,863
Life is just...

112
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:03,665
Maybe you should get a new job.

113
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:06,467
I like my job.

114
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:10,206
Of course you do, and that's what I love
about you. You're so easily pleased.

115
00:07:11,273 --> 00:07:14,775
I want a break
from all the drudgery.

116
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:19,046
I mean, I want
my life to expand.

117
00:07:19,048 --> 00:07:20,314
Yes, I know... I know
what you mean.

118
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:22,282
- You do?
- Yeah, I do. I do.

119
00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:23,684
- You do?
- I do. I do. I do.

120
00:07:23,686 --> 00:07:25,786
That's why I think
that if we had a baby...

121
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:30,157
I told you I don't
want a goddamn baby.

122
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:34,797
We must have been insane not to
resolve this before we got married.

123
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:40,868
Huh! Baby? Yeah, a baby! Who's gonna take care
of the baby and all the stuff for the baby

124
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,037
and everything like that?

125
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,709
Guess what? Roxy's
pregnant with triplets.

126
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:52,946
In your wildest dreams you cannot imagine
the torture the triplets would be,

127
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:55,217
and our marriage
would snap like a twig.

128
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:59,219
She and Nick are in some kind of therapy
like marriage counseling or something.

129
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:00,721
Oh, Jesus.

130
00:08:00,723 --> 00:08:02,091
I think we should try it.

131
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,325
It doesn't mean that there's
something wrong with us.

132
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:08,328
It just means that we want to
understand each other better.

133
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,733
It... it's totally normal.

134
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:14,301
It may be totally normal,
but why do we need it?

135
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:17,237
Because we do,
because it's a good idea.

136
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:22,910
We're fine the way we are,
and you talk about money issues, right?

137
00:08:22,912 --> 00:08:28,248
We're just... we're gonna pay to... to
invite a complete stranger into our lives?

138
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:34,790
Well, we could, for example,
get a little help with the baby question.

139
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,727
I mean, couldn't
we at least try it?

140
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:42,331
It could change
our lives, right?

141
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:48,037
I'm against it, but... but

142
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:53,106
if it'll make you happy, I'll
try it once to make you happy.

143
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:54,508
You are such a wonderful man.

144
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,878
Oh.

145
00:08:57,513 --> 00:08:58,714
Hmm.

146
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:02,349
If we hurry, we got some time
before Louise gets home.

147
00:09:02,351 --> 00:09:03,984
I don't need much time.

148
00:09:05,554 --> 00:09:07,054
Mom!

149
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:08,422
What?

150
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:10,290
I need more time than that.

151
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:37,186
Hi.

152
00:09:37,553 --> 00:09:40,187
How are you?
Traffic was stupid.

153
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:41,255
It was.

154
00:09:41,257 --> 00:09:43,557
Yeah, yeah, terrible.

155
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,197
Welcome.

156
00:09:49,398 --> 00:09:51,300
I'm Judy Small.
Please come in.

157
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:05,114
So the best way to begin is for you to
tell me a little bit about why you're here.

158
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:10,352
Um,

159
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:12,988
I guess

160
00:10:15,557 --> 00:10:19,928
I just really want
our marriage to be

161
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:22,431
the real thing.

162
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,566
You think it isn't
the real thing?

163
00:10:26,568 --> 00:10:29,403
No, I... I didn't... no,
I didn't mean that.

164
00:10:29,405 --> 00:10:31,905
I... I just... um...

165
00:10:31,907 --> 00:10:37,212
For whatever reason I think
I just... I don't feel satisfied.

166
00:10:38,314 --> 00:10:39,548
Why do you think that is?

167
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:42,451
I don't know.

168
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:48,924
I met my first husband
when I was in college.

169
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:54,528
We fell in love,
and we got married,

170
00:10:54,530 --> 00:11:00,235
and we had Louise,
and one day I woke up to a ringing phone

171
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,371
and he was dead.

172
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:08,310
He was out fishing at
night with his friends and

173
00:11:10,512 --> 00:11:13,349
he fell overboard and
was killed by the propeller.

174
00:11:16,452 --> 00:11:17,486
I am sorry.

175
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,690
For five years I took
care of Louise all by myself.

176
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:24,692
I made all the money.

177
00:11:24,694 --> 00:11:28,564
I paid all the bills, and
I took the garbage out,

178
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,867
and I guess I just-

179
00:11:33,469 --> 00:11:36,136
I kind of want to
be taken care of.

180
00:11:36,138 --> 00:11:40,275
- And you feel that Bob doesn't take care of you?
- No, I... I mean, yes.

181
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:42,945
I love Bob.

182
00:11:43,312 --> 00:11:44,279
I just-

183
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:47,447
I think maybe I want
more than he does.

184
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:49,983
He... he doesn't seem to
care about money at all.

185
00:11:49,985 --> 00:11:51,251
No, I care.

186
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:53,989
I care. It's just that money has
never been that important to me.

187
00:11:56,125 --> 00:12:00,295
I just want to be happier I
guess, you know, I want... if

188
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:07,136
true happiness exists, and I think it does,
I mean, I definitely tasted it with Bob.

189
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:12,641
If happiness is out
there, I just really want it.

190
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,177
I see.

191
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:21,250
Why are you here today, Bob?

192
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:24,953
Well,

193
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:28,123
yeah, Susan pretty
much dragged me here.

194
00:12:35,063 --> 00:12:38,733
Tell me, what is it
you do professionally?

195
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:42,068
Oh, um, I'm the Head of
Programming at The Nature Channel.

196
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,203
I love that channel.

197
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:44,137
You do?

198
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:48,375
Yes, I find animals
just so fascinating.

199
00:12:48,377 --> 00:12:50,343
Oh, well, I just uh...
you're going to love this.

200
00:12:50,345 --> 00:12:52,948
I just finished this special
about polar bears.

201
00:12:53,382 --> 00:12:55,517
Just remarkable animals.

202
00:12:56,185 --> 00:12:57,150
Remarkable.

203
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,786
Well, that's splendid.

204
00:12:58,788 --> 00:13:03,959
I just want our marriage to be the best
it can be, to be as strong as it can be.

205
00:13:04,426 --> 00:13:06,595
Is there something
wrong with that?

206
00:13:07,229 --> 00:13:11,164
Do you have ideas about how I might
be able to help you in this regard?

207
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:17,239
Well, yes, I mean there are a few
things, maybe one, or two, or three.

208
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:23,310
First, there's the issue of, you
know, how we both feel about money,

209
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:24,812
how much we need
to feel secure.

210
00:13:24,814 --> 00:13:26,112
- I think that's a big one.
- Hmm.

211
00:13:26,114 --> 00:13:29,249
And then there's the issue

212
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:31,386
of whether or not
we have a baby.

213
00:13:32,254 --> 00:13:34,020
Mm-hmm.

214
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:37,725
And then there's our family dynamic, you know,
Louise, my daughter, she's 13 years old

215
00:13:37,727 --> 00:13:40,761
and she's lovely.

216
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:43,465
She's a blossoming
young woman, really, and

217
00:13:45,768 --> 00:13:47,737
lately I wonder

218
00:13:49,171 --> 00:13:51,304
if it's getting
complicated for Bob.

219
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:52,207
What?

220
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,643
What are you even
talking about right now?

221
00:13:56,645 --> 00:13:59,414
The other morning,
in the kitchen,

222
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:04,019
I saw you looking at her.
She was in her underwear.

223
00:14:11,527 --> 00:14:12,492
Yeah.

224
00:14:12,494 --> 00:14:13,293
Yes.

225
00:14:13,295 --> 00:14:15,262
I see Louise.

226
00:14:15,264 --> 00:14:18,799
I'm not looking at her, not in the
way that you're implying at least.

227
00:14:18,801 --> 00:14:20,469
I can't even believe
you're saying this.

228
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:29,442
You know what? I think... I think I'm a pretty
damn good stepfather, and a good husband...

229
00:14:29,444 --> 00:14:31,146
- Yes.
- too for that matter.

230
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:33,315
I love Louise.

231
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:35,484
I love Susan, but

232
00:14:36,618 --> 00:14:39,087
a comment like that,
that is just damn hurtful.

233
00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:41,089
It's damn hurtful.

234
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,161
Perhaps Louise
should join us next week.

235
00:14:48,163 --> 00:14:49,631
If you think that's
helpful, yeah.

236
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:51,066
I defer.

237
00:15:12,654 --> 00:15:15,723
So are you and Bob
getting a divorce?

238
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:18,226
Oh, baby, of course not.

239
00:15:18,695 --> 00:15:20,730
- No.
- Well, then why are you seeing a shrink?

240
00:15:21,931 --> 00:15:25,733
- Never mind. Don't tell me.
- She sees lots of couples.

241
00:15:25,735 --> 00:15:28,401
Don't tell me that.
That's really gross.

242
00:15:28,403 --> 00:15:29,603
- Really, gross?
- Mm-hmm.

243
00:15:29,605 --> 00:15:32,207
- Oh, it's so gross.
- Yeah, it's disgusting.

244
00:15:33,342 --> 00:15:36,578
Listen, you are a very
important part of this family,

245
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,784
and you are my favorite
person in the entire world

246
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:46,754
so I want you to come
with us next time we see her.

247
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:47,922
- No way.
- Yes.

248
00:15:47,924 --> 00:15:50,891
- No! No, I... I won't do it.
- You are going to see her.

249
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:52,592
- No.
- Yes, you are.

250
00:15:52,594 --> 00:15:53,894
- Yes, you are.
- No.

251
00:15:53,896 --> 00:15:54,897
Yes!

252
00:16:00,803 --> 00:16:02,703
- <i>Señor.</i>
- Amigo.

253
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:04,337
How are those polar
bears coming?

254
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,239
Good, yeah, almost set to go.

255
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:06,909
Great.

256
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:09,309
Uh, you got a minute to talk?

257
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:11,511
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem.

258
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:12,280
What's up?

259
00:16:18,054 --> 00:16:23,492
Clarette got pink-slipped at Disney so she's
freaking out about finding a new job, and

260
00:16:24,226 --> 00:16:26,694
I don't exactly blame her
'cause times are tough.

261
00:16:26,696 --> 00:16:28,929
Yeah, I'm sorry
to hear that, man.

262
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:34,300
Yeah, so our income just got cut in half, and
now she decides she wants to get married,

263
00:16:34,302 --> 00:16:36,536
and buy a place with a
swimming pool up in the hills.

264
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,505
I thought you and
Clarette were married.

265
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:41,343
No, just... just keeping house.

266
00:16:41,878 --> 00:16:44,312
Anyway, that's...
that's not why I'm here.

267
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:50,318
Um, you know, Annabelle
Bernard down in accounting?

268
00:16:51,486 --> 00:16:54,287
Dark hair, great
legs, short skirt.

269
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:55,890
Yeah, yeah, sure, Annabelle.

270
00:16:55,892 --> 00:16:58,326
We... we started this thing,

271
00:16:59,028 --> 00:17:00,728
you know, nothing serious.

272
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:05,632
Just a couple of days a week at lunch, and
then yesterday she comes into my office,

273
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:10,639
closed the door behind her, as soon as that
happens, man, my heart went through the floor

274
00:17:11,373 --> 00:17:16,911
'cause she's in love with me,
wants us to quit our jobs, move to Mexico.

275
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:18,045
Seriously?

276
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:18,848
Yeah.

277
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:22,850
And... and I'll tell you what scares the
shit out of me. It's... it's not Clarette.

278
00:17:22,852 --> 00:17:24,651
I... I can handle Clarette.

279
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:27,988
It's... with the world turned upside down these
days, all she has to do is point the finger

280
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,355
and my ass is grass.

281
00:17:29,357 --> 00:17:31,859
Sexual harassment?
You think she'd do that?

282
00:17:31,861 --> 00:17:33,928
Nowadays? Come on.

283
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,898
These women will do anything.

284
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,566
Wow! Well, have you
tried talking to her?

285
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:43,536
Have you ever tried talking to a woman
especially one that's pissed off at you?

286
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:45,507
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

287
00:17:47,043 --> 00:17:47,810
Um-

288
00:17:52,414 --> 00:17:55,484
Um, do you want
me to talk to her?

289
00:17:56,085 --> 00:17:57,985
Oh, man, would you?

290
00:17:57,987 --> 00:17:59,689
Yeah, sure.

291
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:03,556
You're a gentleman
and a scholar.

292
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:04,557
No, it's my pleasure.

293
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,828
- Thank you.
- For sure.

294
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:10,998
Hey I'd love to stick around, but I got an
appointment across town I got to get to.

295
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,466
- Job prospect?
- Yeah, no, no, no, no.

296
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,467
Marriage counseling.

297
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:15,770
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

298
00:18:15,772 --> 00:18:16,906
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

299
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,718
It's okay to laugh.

300
00:18:29,118 --> 00:18:32,987
I just think this whole
thing is weird.

301
00:18:32,989 --> 00:18:37,524
Laughter can be very constructive
sometimes just for the release of it.

302
00:18:37,526 --> 00:18:41,697
I laugh between sessions,
alone, right here in my office.

303
00:18:44,934 --> 00:18:46,533
Oh, bless you.

304
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:47,302
Thank you.

305
00:18:49,739 --> 00:18:50,639
There.

306
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:51,941
Bingo!

307
00:18:53,475 --> 00:18:54,010
Hmm,

308
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,545
one sneeze.

309
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,650
If I didn't have my hankie, bacteria,
germs would've spread amongst us all.

310
00:19:03,652 --> 00:19:09,357
Think of your conflicts as germs,
left unchecked, without a hankie,

311
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:14,128
they spread among you...
the three of you, living unit.

312
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,033
I have never really felt
like a germ before.

313
00:19:19,135 --> 00:19:19,936
Well,

314
00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:24,673
other than mortality
itself, it is the

315
00:19:25,074 --> 00:19:30,046
human bond most essential,
a web that ensnares us all.

316
00:19:30,612 --> 00:19:32,179
Ensnares?

317
00:19:32,181 --> 00:19:38,087
Yes, I'm referring to the thread of
life that wraps us around and binds us.

318
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:40,688
Hmm.

319
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,992
Um, do I have to be here?
'Cause I have homework.

320
00:19:44,994 --> 00:19:52,802
Louise, this is your chance, in the safety
of this room to say anything you want.

321
00:19:56,105 --> 00:19:59,507
Well, there is something

322
00:20:01,978 --> 00:20:03,645
since I'm here.

323
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:09,919
Baby, we wanna hear what
you have to say. Go ahead.

324
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:13,888
I have no freedom.

325
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,025
My mom is scared to let me do
anything ever since my father died.

326
00:20:18,027 --> 00:20:19,693
That is not true.

327
00:20:19,695 --> 00:20:21,862
I'm 13, and I can't even
go on a sleepover.

328
00:20:21,864 --> 00:20:23,663
You've been on a sleepover.

329
00:20:23,665 --> 00:20:28,534
Once, and then you showed up in the middle of
the night in your pajamas with Comfy Cream.

330
00:20:28,536 --> 00:20:30,773
You'd slammed your finger.

331
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:34,641
It was 'cause the girl having
a sleepover only had a dad.

332
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:36,110
Oh, not true.

333
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:37,778
Yes, it is. It is so true.

334
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,947
- No, it's not true!
- Yes, it is.

335
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:41,549
It's true, right?

336
00:20:42,952 --> 00:20:44,887
You know what? I think your mother
just wants what's best for you.

337
00:20:48,925 --> 00:20:54,997
Louise, just so I understand,
are you saying that your mom,

338
00:20:55,597 --> 00:20:56,799
what, is

339
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,101
afraid of men?

340
00:21:01,804 --> 00:21:04,671
She definitely
doesn't trust them.

341
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:08,077
I cannot believe that
you're saying this.

342
00:21:15,184 --> 00:21:19,121
Can I go? Can I,
please, be done, Mom?

343
00:21:19,922 --> 00:21:21,188
Fine by me.

344
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,725
Bye, sweetie.

345
00:21:24,927 --> 00:21:26,528
- Bye-bye.
- Mm-hmm.

346
00:21:33,302 --> 00:21:39,641
You... you do understand that you have to take
everything Louise says with a big grain of salt.

347
00:21:40,276 --> 00:21:42,943
I'm really pleased that I got
the chance to meet her.

348
00:21:42,945 --> 00:21:46,716
You know what? I should say right
now that Susan is a wonderful mother.

349
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:49,183
Thank you.

350
00:21:49,185 --> 00:21:50,652
I needed that.

351
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:51,988
Okay. Well,

352
00:21:53,723 --> 00:22:00,863
I've had this chance to see you as a family
unit, and there are some certain tensions.

353
00:22:02,664 --> 00:22:07,269
What would you think about the idea of
me spending time alone with each of you?

354
00:22:08,237 --> 00:22:11,038
I think that sounds
like a great idea.

355
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,041
Hmm.

356
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:23,150
There's this new couple, the
Howards, typical LA couple.

357
00:22:23,152 --> 00:22:28,088
Their problems are
very ordinary as is she,

358
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,293
but there's something
about the husband,

359
00:22:33,896 --> 00:22:35,896
something elusive.

360
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:36,964
It's a quality.

361
00:22:36,966 --> 00:22:39,702
It's very difficult to define.

362
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:25,879
I've just learned that
Judith Smolinsky James is in Los Angeles.

363
00:23:25,881 --> 00:23:31,118
Apparently, she's resumed her practice
there under the name of Judy Small.

364
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,654
What did he say? Judy who?

365
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,023
It was inevitable.

366
00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:37,524
Someone please fill me in.

367
00:23:37,526 --> 00:23:41,695
She was removed from our roster two
years ago for unprofessional conduct.

368
00:23:41,697 --> 00:23:45,999
It was an unfortunate incident of
counter transference enactment.

369
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:47,034
Why do I not know this?

370
00:23:47,036 --> 00:23:48,302
You must have blocked it?

371
00:23:48,304 --> 00:23:49,338
Whose case?

372
00:23:51,373 --> 00:23:52,873
Yes, she was mine.

373
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:59,046
A severely narcissistic woman,
unanalyzable, entirely without boundaries,

374
00:23:59,048 --> 00:24:02,015
but with an intact capacity
for reality assessment.

375
00:24:02,017 --> 00:24:04,451
For 15 years she had
a spotless record.

376
00:24:04,453 --> 00:24:07,855
I mean, essentially this woman
was raised by wolves.

377
00:24:07,857 --> 00:24:09,756
It was a classic case
of soul murder.

378
00:24:09,758 --> 00:24:15,229
So what are we supposed to do?
Howl at the moon? Dangle red meat?

379
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:17,431
I... I think she still has a
contribution to make.

380
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:19,768
Except for the patient in
Boston who killed himself.

381
00:24:20,436 --> 00:24:24,071
Her method was unorthodox
to say the least.

382
00:24:24,073 --> 00:24:26,240
Look, I'm not saying that
mistakes weren't made.

383
00:24:26,242 --> 00:24:28,377
Mistakes that I
am trying to rectify,

384
00:24:28,944 --> 00:24:32,479
but I will tell you all that unofficially
I have been trying to find her.

385
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:34,314
She's drawing you into
a boundary violation.

386
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:41,290
Well, I'm certainly being drawn into a role change,
but I'm the only authority figure she's got.

387
00:24:42,725 --> 00:24:43,792
Okay.

388
00:24:44,326 --> 00:24:46,059
Dress code.

389
00:24:46,061 --> 00:24:47,096
Stress code.

390
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:53,267
...appearing in torn-tattered,
dirty clothing, skin-tight short shorts,

391
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:57,873
beach clothing or other garments
inappropriate for blah, blah, blah.

392
00:24:58,874 --> 00:24:59,942
Try this on.

393
00:25:00,976 --> 00:25:01,911
Good.

394
00:25:02,912 --> 00:25:05,746
Aren't these perfect? Noisy.

395
00:25:05,748 --> 00:25:07,381
- Perfect.
- Yeah.

396
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:11,418
I know. I'm wearing the blue
tights that I cut up the other day.

397
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,825
Mm-hmm. And the shirt that
I cut up with the red top under.

398
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,296
We're leaving.

399
00:25:22,298 --> 00:25:23,365
One second.

400
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:30,270
- Bye, baby, have a good day.
- Bye.

401
00:25:30,272 --> 00:25:31,874
- Thanks, Mom.
- Hmm.

402
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:34,376
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

403
00:25:48,357 --> 00:25:50,257
We should do this every day.

404
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:51,227
Ditto.

405
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:57,066
You two.

406
00:25:59,501 --> 00:26:01,804
Yes, you two.

407
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:05,307
Ladies, I know you were at
the assembly last week, right?

408
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:07,007
Yeah, sure.

409
00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:08,842
And you're aware of
the new dress code?

410
00:26:08,844 --> 00:26:09,745
Sort of.

411
00:26:10,446 --> 00:26:12,212
No torn clothing.

412
00:26:12,214 --> 00:26:13,847
These clothes aren't torn.

413
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:15,115
We cut them ourselves.

414
00:26:15,117 --> 00:26:16,550
To my office.

415
00:26:16,552 --> 00:26:18,187
Discuss this further.

416
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:21,223
James,

417
00:26:22,324 --> 00:26:24,558
how's this finger?
Come with me too.

418
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,059
And the rest of you, homeroom.

419
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:27,062
Come on.

420
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:32,065
You've got no idea how much
dough this place takes in.

421
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:34,234
Our work is lining
other guys' pockets.

422
00:26:34,236 --> 00:26:36,336
They're raking in
it upstairs on our backs.

423
00:26:36,338 --> 00:26:37,471
I got all the numbers.

424
00:26:37,473 --> 00:26:38,939
I know how much
you make every year.

425
00:26:38,941 --> 00:26:40,042
125, right?

426
00:26:41,243 --> 00:26:43,477
Well, yeah, you know, I'm
gonna ask Beaver for a raise.

427
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:45,012
They all gonna be rat shit.

428
00:26:45,014 --> 00:26:48,615
- Beaver pulls in 10 times that much, and that's before bonuses.
- Ten times?

429
00:26:48,617 --> 00:26:50,450
Look, we
start our own outfit.

430
00:26:50,452 --> 00:26:52,252
We don't have to limit
ourselves to that nature crap.

431
00:26:52,254 --> 00:26:53,520
We can do whatever we want.

432
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:54,621
Well, I like the nature crap.

433
00:26:54,623 --> 00:26:57,457
All the big media companies
need content right now.

434
00:26:57,459 --> 00:26:59,393
It's the same
drumbeat every day.

435
00:26:59,395 --> 00:27:00,927
Content is king.

436
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:04,398
Parents are looking for a place to park
their kids and we can provide that.

437
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,900
Who's our partner?
Motherfucking nature.

438
00:27:06,902 --> 00:27:08,235
Walter's got all the contacts.

439
00:27:08,237 --> 00:27:09,704
He can sell ice to
fucking Eskimos.

440
00:27:09,706 --> 00:27:13,006
We get to keep doing exactly what
we're doing right now except this time

441
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:14,443
we're lining
our own pockets.

442
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,209
Okay.

443
00:27:16,211 --> 00:27:18,078
Okay. So why do
you guys need me?

444
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,249
We're great at making deals.
You're great at making product.

445
00:27:21,483 --> 00:27:24,918
Conservatively, we're gonna quadruple
our take home in the first year,

446
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,456
but remember, Beaver gets one
whiff of this and we're fucked.

447
00:27:29,425 --> 00:27:32,125
Did you have sex
after our last session?

448
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:33,293
Bob and I?

449
00:27:33,295 --> 00:27:34,430
Yes.

450
00:27:37,499 --> 00:27:38,832
You mean right after?

451
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:44,406
Susan, we're trying to understand
how you are, just you and Bob

452
00:27:45,441 --> 00:27:49,878
together, your
sexual dialogue.

453
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:55,918
So you're here to satisfy Susan,
is that the pattern? Her needs dictate?

454
00:27:57,619 --> 00:28:01,288
I don't know.
Yeah, yeah, probably.

455
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:06,195
I don't have a single couple in my practice
that doesn't have some conflict in this area.

456
00:28:06,628 --> 00:28:10,364
Um, I'm confused because
that's not really our problem.

457
00:28:10,366 --> 00:28:15,535
She knew what I did when she married
me, and what can I do about that?

458
00:28:15,537 --> 00:28:17,337
- Of course she did.
- Yeah.

459
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:20,876
And you're a man and you
have needs of your own.

460
00:28:21,477 --> 00:28:26,246
Yeah, well, I'm not sure Susan's
too concerned about that.

461
00:28:26,248 --> 00:28:35,255
Sex is one way that we stave off a fear of loss
which feels particularly resonant for you.

462
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:37,224
You've already
lost one husband.

463
00:28:37,226 --> 00:28:39,061
You don't want to lose another.

464
00:28:40,028 --> 00:28:41,029
Oh, God.

465
00:28:42,164 --> 00:28:46,366
I don't think that I'm afraid
of losing Bob, do you?

466
00:28:46,368 --> 00:28:47,702
Have you been faithful to him?

467
00:28:47,704 --> 00:28:50,470
To Bob? Yes. Absolutely.

468
00:28:50,472 --> 00:28:53,375
And what do we know
about his sexual history?

469
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:59,579
I mean, he was 39 when we married so
he must have known a lot of women.

470
00:28:59,581 --> 00:29:01,450
He does seem to
appreciate women.

471
00:29:02,418 --> 00:29:04,052
You could tell that so quickly?

472
00:29:04,553 --> 00:29:06,987
Well, we can run,
but we can't hide.

473
00:29:06,989 --> 00:29:11,960
It's not uncommon for women, especially
women who tend to be controlling, to become

474
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:15,228
competitive with their
adolescent daughters.

475
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,563
No shit.

476
00:29:16,565 --> 00:29:18,200
Has he been faithful to you?

477
00:29:25,742 --> 00:29:27,576
I'm sorry. What
was the question?

478
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:30,979
So could the tension be
from something else?

479
00:29:33,716 --> 00:29:34,550
Like what?

480
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,618
Your sexual history.

481
00:29:40,022 --> 00:29:42,991
Why? Why did... did
Susan say something or-

482
00:29:47,062 --> 00:29:48,530
Did Susan say something?

483
00:29:49,565 --> 00:29:53,467
Sheila, right? It happened
before we were married.

484
00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:55,604
That's so unbelievable.

485
00:29:56,205 --> 00:29:57,637
Okay.

486
00:29:57,639 --> 00:30:02,144
So I had this one-night thing with
an ex-girlfriend named Sheila.

487
00:30:02,745 --> 00:30:06,179
I confessed to Susan because it made
me realize that I was in love with her.

488
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:08,050
I proposed to her that night.

489
00:30:08,818 --> 00:30:11,184
I can't believe
she's still angry.

490
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:13,153
I cannot believe it.

491
00:30:13,155 --> 00:30:14,623
Trust is like a muscle.

492
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:19,261
Once it's torn,
it's difficult to repair.

493
00:30:28,637 --> 00:30:31,507
Better watch out. Mom
is in a pretty shitty mood.

494
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:33,743
Thank you for the warning.

495
00:30:54,196 --> 00:30:55,629
How's your day?

496
00:30:55,631 --> 00:30:57,732
Fine. Louise!

497
00:30:57,734 --> 00:30:59,401
I just saw her leave.

498
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:03,438
What? I... I just sent
her to her room.

499
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:08,043
Honey, maybe just this one
time you should let it go.

500
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:11,346
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

501
00:31:11,781 --> 00:31:15,649
It's gonna be dark really soon,
and she's out there all alone.

502
00:31:15,651 --> 00:31:18,753
I don't think that's
really safe, do you?

503
00:31:18,755 --> 00:31:21,388
- Ha.
- Considering the fact that there's been three robberies

504
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,190
in this neighborhood
in the last six months,

505
00:31:24,192 --> 00:31:28,530
to say nothing of the fact
that I sent her to her room.

506
00:31:31,734 --> 00:31:34,301
Sounds like you guys had
a pretty tough afternoon.

507
00:31:34,303 --> 00:31:35,604
Oh!

508
00:31:37,406 --> 00:31:39,074
What the fuck?

509
00:31:45,547 --> 00:31:47,647
Hey, you know what?
I think we need a vacation.

510
00:31:47,649 --> 00:31:50,918
Oh, yeah? That sounds
great. With what money?

511
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:56,289
Don't you worry about money, okay? Our money
situation is about to change for the better.

512
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:57,892
How? What happened?

513
00:31:57,894 --> 00:32:03,630
Let's rent a convertible, drive up the
coast, stop whenever we feel like it,

514
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:07,802
rent motels by the
hour, no-tell motels.

515
00:32:07,804 --> 00:32:11,304
- Hmm, that does sound good, doesn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

516
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,206
Did Beaver give you a raise?

517
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:14,942
And Louise can
stay with friends.

518
00:32:14,944 --> 00:32:17,878
Hell, she's probably old enough
to stay here by herself.

519
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,447
I am, definitely.

520
00:32:20,449 --> 00:32:24,653
The next time I tell you to go to
your room I expect you to stay there.

521
00:32:25,722 --> 00:32:28,323
Will you tell her that I'm getting
too old for the room stuff?

522
00:32:28,925 --> 00:32:30,392
Tell her yourself.

523
00:32:32,127 --> 00:32:35,832
I'm getting too old for the room stuff unless
you need permission from your therapist.

524
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:38,231
Oh.

525
00:32:38,233 --> 00:32:44,772
I am trying very hard to deal with a
lot of confusing and difficult things

526
00:32:44,774 --> 00:32:47,908
which is why I
sought out Judy Small

527
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:51,411
so I would appreciate it if you could
give me a little bit more respect.

528
00:32:51,413 --> 00:32:53,313
Well, Judy Small is a loser.

529
00:32:53,315 --> 00:32:55,785
I didn't ask you
for your opinion,

530
00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:00,688
but because I care about your
thoughts, um, go ahead, tell me.

531
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,622
What do you think?

532
00:33:02,624 --> 00:33:04,792
I don't trust people
who wear scarves.

533
00:33:04,794 --> 00:33:05,860
I wear a scarf.

534
00:33:05,862 --> 00:33:08,929
- No, you don't.
- Hey, hey, come on.

535
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:12,565
Let's... let's just all cut
each other a little slack, huh?

536
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:13,736
Thank you. Exactly.

537
00:33:17,439 --> 00:33:19,940
I need to watch somebody
turn... someone has to turn...

538
00:33:19,942 --> 00:33:23,610
I know but it's... it feels
like... it feels like years.

539
00:33:23,612 --> 00:33:27,882
Oh, how are my babies?

540
00:33:27,884 --> 00:33:30,851
I will see you
fine ladies later.

541
00:33:30,853 --> 00:33:31,888
Bye, Nick.

542
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:38,591
Do you and Nick ever talk about what happens
at Judy Small's, like, outside of the office?

543
00:33:38,593 --> 00:33:40,895
No. Nick and I don't talk at
all. That's why we're going.

544
00:33:40,897 --> 00:33:45,365
She has me and Bob going separately,
and I... we don't even talk about it.

545
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:46,801
I don't know if I
like it or hate it.

546
00:33:46,803 --> 00:33:49,704
I love being pregnant.

547
00:33:49,706 --> 00:33:51,939
I mean, look at me,
I'm glowing.

548
00:33:51,941 --> 00:33:55,542
There was this guy getting a cappuccino yesterday
who said he had to put on his sunglasses

549
00:33:55,544 --> 00:33:56,378
'cause I was so dazzling.

550
00:33:57,814 --> 00:34:00,613
Hey, you don't get to be
depressed while I'm pregnant.

551
00:34:00,615 --> 00:34:02,482
I'm not depressed.

552
00:34:02,484 --> 00:34:05,853
I'm just a little discouraged.

553
00:34:05,855 --> 00:34:07,822
Susan, you are not pulling
another one of your no-shows.

554
00:34:07,824 --> 00:34:09,389
You are coming to
Nick's launch party.

555
00:34:09,391 --> 00:34:11,458
Stern is gonna be there.
I need you to meet her.

556
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,760
There are gonna be a lot
of big people at this thing.

557
00:34:12,762 --> 00:34:14,028
I thought Nick was a writer.

558
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:17,530
Writing is not big money. This
thing with Stern is big money.

559
00:34:17,532 --> 00:34:21,367
Now, I have until four o'clock today to
decide on the stencils for the baby's rooms.

560
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:24,038
I have it narrowed
down to koala bears,

561
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,606
and sailboats, and then these
adorable little Raphael angels.

562
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:27,609
So do you want to help me?

563
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,244
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

564
00:34:31,748 --> 00:34:33,246
Hi, Juanita.

565
00:34:33,248 --> 00:34:36,418
Can we have the stencils on the
counter in the kitchen, <i>por favor?</i>

566
00:34:37,552 --> 00:34:38,688
So cute. Oh.

567
00:34:40,223 --> 00:34:42,957
Also, can we have a pitcher of iced tea?
Pretty, pretty, <i>por favor.</i>

568
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:44,259
Thank you.

569
00:34:46,062 --> 00:34:48,030
Twenty-three more minutes?

570
00:34:48,698 --> 00:34:50,032
Oh, my gosh.

571
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,834
I can't believe we
just have to sit here.

572
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:55,836
Detention so sucks.

573
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:57,305
I hate this school.

574
00:34:57,907 --> 00:34:59,407
It sucks.

575
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:01,476
We're such idiots.

576
00:35:03,713 --> 00:35:04,947
We're out of here.

577
00:35:05,848 --> 00:35:07,480
Where are you going?

578
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:08,716
Later.

579
00:35:16,726 --> 00:35:19,427
I'm not allowed to take
public transportation.

580
00:35:19,796 --> 00:35:20,930
Me neither.

581
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,752
Hi, person!

582
00:35:58,433 --> 00:35:59,934
<i>Judith, it's Ed Kingsley.</i>

583
00:35:59,936 --> 00:36:02,569
<i>I've been trying to reach
you for some time.</i>

584
00:36:02,571 --> 00:36:07,574
I understand you're in Los Angeles,
but it's important that we speak.

585
00:36:07,576 --> 00:36:10,643
We have some matters that
I think we need to discuss.

586
00:36:10,645 --> 00:36:11,881
<i>So, please, call me.</i>

587
00:36:13,015 --> 00:36:15,885
<i>It's not too late to reach
a deeper understanding.</i>

588
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:32,367
Oh, my God.

589
00:36:33,736 --> 00:36:36,839
That's Judy Small. She's
the marriage counselor.

590
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:43,911
Hey, yo, marriage counselor!

591
00:36:43,913 --> 00:36:45,114
What are you doing?

592
00:36:47,717 --> 00:36:49,517
Oh, crap.

593
00:37:25,154 --> 00:37:27,187
Oh! Oh, my God.

594
00:37:27,189 --> 00:37:28,488
She marked me.

595
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,525
You need to tell your mother.

596
00:37:30,927 --> 00:37:33,794
I'm not allowed to take the bus.

597
00:37:33,796 --> 00:37:35,597
I don't know
what I'm doing wrong.

598
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:44,006
I was hoping that by embarking on this
journey that my life would get better,

599
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,708
but as weird as it sounds,
I think it's getting worse.

600
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,509
How do you feel
it's getting worse?

601
00:37:49,511 --> 00:37:54,649
Well, I've found myself
daydreaming about my first husband,

602
00:37:56,618 --> 00:38:02,524
wondering what my life would
be like if Dominic hadn't died.

603
00:38:05,861 --> 00:38:12,068
You know, it's crazy, this life that
we have, you know, like you pick

604
00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:20,676
a husband which means you pick a
life, and he dies so it dies.

605
00:38:21,911 --> 00:38:26,648
Has it occurred to you
you're longing for justice?

606
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,783
Justice?

607
00:38:29,785 --> 00:38:33,155
Payback for Bob's
past sexual infidelity?

608
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:39,860
He told you about that?
About... about Sheila?

609
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:43,330
It's important that we get
to the root of these issues.

610
00:38:43,332 --> 00:38:47,735
Oh, God, but I... I didn't
think he still cared about that.

611
00:38:47,737 --> 00:38:49,504
Did you think it was trivial?

612
00:38:52,008 --> 00:38:55,011
Are you not aware that your husband
is an exceedingly attractive man?

613
00:38:57,046 --> 00:39:00,748
I know he's an attractive man.

614
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,650
It may be that you
need to take action.

615
00:39:04,652 --> 00:39:06,453
Take action?

616
00:39:06,455 --> 00:39:14,261
In order to make peace with his sexual history,
you may need to rebalance the sexual scales.

617
00:39:14,263 --> 00:39:15,663
The sexual scales?

618
00:39:16,032 --> 00:39:17,297
The power dynamic.

619
00:39:17,299 --> 00:39:19,233
I'm so confused.

620
00:39:19,235 --> 00:39:21,871
You may need to even the score.

621
00:39:34,016 --> 00:39:34,817
Hey!

622
00:39:35,718 --> 00:39:36,685
Hi.

623
00:39:39,288 --> 00:39:43,357
So tell me upfront, is
this work or pleasure?

624
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:46,060
Hmm.

625
00:39:46,062 --> 00:39:50,266
Hey, can I get a martini
straight up twist? Thank you.

626
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:55,069
Or does this have something to do with
Reed and Walter's new business venture?

627
00:39:55,071 --> 00:39:57,104
Wait, wait. How did
you hear about that?

628
00:39:57,106 --> 00:40:01,310
Oh, Reed mentioned it to
me a while ago, you know,

629
00:40:02,812 --> 00:40:04,011
pillow talk.

630
00:40:04,013 --> 00:40:05,779
Oh, hmm.

631
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:09,016
No, no, that has... that
has nothing to do with that,

632
00:40:09,018 --> 00:40:14,054
or your work by the way which is great,
yeah, across the board, excellent.

633
00:40:14,056 --> 00:40:14,822
- Yes.
- Cheers!

634
00:40:14,824 --> 00:40:15,825
Thank you.

635
00:40:19,929 --> 00:40:26,967
No, Reed came into my office the other
day, and he's concerned that-

636
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:31,240
that there might be some,
I don't know, bad blood or...

637
00:40:33,142 --> 00:40:34,942
What an asshole he is?

638
00:40:34,944 --> 00:40:35,678
Ha-ha.

639
00:40:37,279 --> 00:40:38,280
You know how, uh,

640
00:40:40,716 --> 00:40:46,755
sometimes you can want something but
then not even realize that you want it?

641
00:40:47,223 --> 00:40:49,256
Yes, yes, I do.

642
00:40:49,258 --> 00:40:52,261
I had wanted to leave my
husband for a very long time,

643
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,365
and then when Reed
stepped in, I just-

644
00:40:58,467 --> 00:41:01,702
I kind of just let myself
get carried away by him.

645
00:41:01,704 --> 00:41:08,809
The shock was how fast and scared he
ran because I never even mentioned

646
00:41:08,811 --> 00:41:13,282
the word sexual harassment, but since he
put it in my head, I don't know, I mean,

647
00:41:15,384 --> 00:41:20,954
I'm tempted, and I would do it, too, if I
had to, you know, just to protect my job.

648
00:41:20,956 --> 00:41:23,926
Well, of course you would,
of course, no question.

649
00:41:30,332 --> 00:41:31,834
You're married, right?

650
00:41:34,136 --> 00:41:35,102
Yes, I am.

651
00:41:35,104 --> 00:41:37,907
- Yes, you are.
- There it is, the evidence.

652
00:41:39,942 --> 00:41:43,145
I was married for 13 years.

653
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:45,779
Wow! Just three for me.

654
00:41:45,781 --> 00:41:48,115
Ooh, that's long enough.

655
00:41:49,485 --> 00:41:51,820
Well, yeah.

656
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,357
Hmm, you want to get
another one of these?

657
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,427
Yeah, why not?

658
00:41:59,862 --> 00:42:01,897
I mean, I have time
for a quickie.

659
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:23,152
Thank you.

660
00:42:24,987 --> 00:42:26,255
Thank you.

661
00:42:43,973 --> 00:42:45,505
Hi.

662
00:42:45,507 --> 00:42:46,974
Oh, thank you.

663
00:42:46,976 --> 00:42:49,910
Yippee! I think I
found you a job.

664
00:42:49,912 --> 00:42:51,511
What?

665
00:42:51,513 --> 00:42:54,047
Pinot furniture, genius designer, you
have to fly to San Francisco to meet him.

666
00:42:54,049 --> 00:42:55,349
- Okay?
- Oh, thank you.

667
00:42:55,351 --> 00:42:56,316
Okay.

668
00:42:56,318 --> 00:42:58,885
You have to meet Serge.
He's married to Stern.

669
00:42:58,887 --> 00:43:01,288
Now, she's a star,
but he's pretty amazing.

670
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,557
Serge, this is my friend Susan.

671
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:04,858
Oh, hello.

672
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,460
- We have known each other for...
- Oh!

673
00:43:06,462 --> 00:43:07,429
Oh, I'm sorry.

674
00:43:08,364 --> 00:43:10,130
Serge is the host
of the stellar affair.

675
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:14,234
Delighted to have you.
Spread your wings, celebrate.

676
00:43:14,236 --> 00:43:17,439
- Thank you.
- This is Stern.

677
00:43:18,173 --> 00:43:19,339
Stern, this is my friend Susan.

678
00:43:19,341 --> 00:43:21,141
Hi, welcome.

679
00:43:21,143 --> 00:43:22,876
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

680
00:43:22,878 --> 00:43:24,446
All right. Let's do it.

681
00:43:25,314 --> 00:43:26,348
Hmm.

682
00:43:27,883 --> 00:43:29,251
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

683
00:43:30,419 --> 00:43:32,586
So tell me, I'm curious...

684
00:43:32,588 --> 00:43:34,087
Mm-hmm.

685
00:43:34,089 --> 00:43:37,226
...how did it all work, you know, like,
did your... did your husband move out?

686
00:43:39,228 --> 00:43:41,528
I'm... no, I'm just... I'm just
curious about the logistics.

687
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:42,929
I'm a logistics guy.

688
00:43:42,931 --> 00:43:47,536
Do you want to know
the secret to a divorce?

689
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:49,271
Hmm.

690
00:43:49,872 --> 00:43:52,274
It is the best thing
in the world.

691
00:43:52,641 --> 00:43:55,108
It is fantastic.

692
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:58,480
I mean, I just can't believe how long I
tied myself in knots trying to avoid it.

693
00:43:59,048 --> 00:44:00,647
It's like taking out the trash.

694
00:44:00,649 --> 00:44:03,852
You do it, and bam! It's done.

695
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:08,524
Wow! So just like
that? 13 years? Out.

696
00:44:10,025 --> 00:44:10,926
Done.

697
00:44:13,262 --> 00:44:14,430
So tell me another secret?

698
00:44:16,598 --> 00:44:18,065
What?

699
00:44:18,067 --> 00:44:20,600
- So now you want to know all my secrets, huh?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

700
00:44:20,602 --> 00:44:22,404
- Yeah.
- Some I do wanna know, yes.

701
00:44:24,973 --> 00:44:28,977
All right. Well, the truth is,

702
00:44:30,112 --> 00:44:32,948
it's all easy, everything,

703
00:44:35,117 --> 00:44:36,118
anything.

704
00:44:36,518 --> 00:44:37,286
Huh.

705
00:44:38,654 --> 00:44:43,357
Once you realize that everything
is structured to keep us down...

706
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,358
Pressed down.

707
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,960
Yes, frightened of ourselves.

708
00:44:46,962 --> 00:44:48,628
Yeah. But not you?

709
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:49,598
Uh-uh.

710
00:44:50,999 --> 00:44:52,067
No, not me.

711
00:44:54,103 --> 00:44:55,135
Not anymore.

712
00:44:55,137 --> 00:44:56,038
Mm-hmm.

713
00:44:57,139 --> 00:44:58,071
Mm-hmm.

714
00:44:58,073 --> 00:45:00,307
- No, no, no, no!
- Yes!

715
00:45:00,309 --> 00:45:03,212
Everybody drives
better on two martinis.

716
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,215
- Everybody knows that.
- Oh.

717
00:45:09,051 --> 00:45:13,120
That, sir, is my carriage.

718
00:45:13,122 --> 00:45:14,221
I can't.

719
00:45:14,223 --> 00:45:17,459
This... this is my chariot.

720
00:45:20,462 --> 00:45:22,264
- Have a good night.
- Good night.

721
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,301
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

722
00:45:32,474 --> 00:45:34,641
- Hello.
- Where the hell are you?

723
00:45:34,643 --> 00:45:36,143
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.

724
00:45:36,145 --> 00:45:41,281
I'm sorry. I... I was held up at work
and I... I'm leaving right now. Bye.

725
00:45:41,283 --> 00:45:42,683
Hurry, please.

726
00:45:42,685 --> 00:45:44,153
I'll see you at work.

727
00:45:55,631 --> 00:45:56,930
To our new venture!

728
00:45:56,932 --> 00:46:00,133
And to those of us lucky enough
to get in on the ground floor...

729
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:02,669
There's nothing I love
more than making money.

730
00:46:02,671 --> 00:46:05,773
Hey, we saw an
opportunity and we seized it.

731
00:46:05,775 --> 00:46:08,341
- Yeah.
- Perch me that deal!

732
00:46:08,343 --> 00:46:09,777
- Wooh!
- Yeah.

733
00:46:09,779 --> 00:46:13,282
- Cheers, darling, cheers.
- Right. Right.

734
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:17,017
I'm sorry I'm late.
Crazy traffic.

735
00:46:17,019 --> 00:46:18,654
South Island, they'll see you.

736
00:46:19,288 --> 00:46:20,487
Congratulations, Nick.

737
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:21,655
- Thank you.
- Well, that's the point of money, darling.

738
00:46:21,657 --> 00:46:24,524
We don't want to be sitting
ducks for the apocalypse.

739
00:46:24,526 --> 00:46:26,761
That's the symptom,
the fear of O.

740
00:46:26,763 --> 00:46:28,161
The fear of O?

741
00:46:28,163 --> 00:46:30,397
Ouroboros, the serpent
that eats its own tail.

742
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,498
Right, right.

743
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,733
None of us is immune.

744
00:46:32,735 --> 00:46:34,234
It happened to me last week.

745
00:46:34,236 --> 00:46:35,803
Why, what happened?

746
00:46:35,805 --> 00:46:39,105
I'm driving home from the gym at 6:00
a.m., Mulholland, I'm at a red light

747
00:46:39,107 --> 00:46:43,711
when three guys cut me off, pulled me
out of the car, stick a gun in my face,

748
00:46:43,713 --> 00:46:46,814
and discuss whether or not
they're gonna blow me away.

749
00:46:46,816 --> 00:46:50,552
They take my wallet, my watch, my rings, my
cell phone, get in the car, and drive off.

750
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,053
It's the end of a
civilized world.

751
00:46:53,055 --> 00:46:54,521
It is inevitable.

752
00:46:54,523 --> 00:46:56,189
I, for one, refuse to surrender.

753
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:59,059
- Did they find your car?
- Who the fuck is they?

754
00:46:59,061 --> 00:47:01,161
Darling, be nice.

755
00:47:01,163 --> 00:47:03,630
They... there ain't no they.

756
00:47:03,632 --> 00:47:07,369
You can kiss goodbye the idea that there's someone
out there who is gonna make it all better

757
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:11,071
because the guys on the white
horses have all run scared.

758
00:47:11,073 --> 00:47:12,441
That's true, yeah.

759
00:47:13,075 --> 00:47:14,574
Where on earth did you
find these people?

760
00:47:14,576 --> 00:47:18,345
Oh, I know. Aren't they
great? Stern is fabulous.

761
00:47:18,347 --> 00:47:20,480
Are you okay?
You look dehydrated.

762
00:47:20,482 --> 00:47:25,020
Um, I need to talk to
you about Judy Small.

763
00:47:25,822 --> 00:47:28,154
Ah, I am getting fat.

764
00:47:28,156 --> 00:47:31,191
You are pregnant with triplets.

765
00:47:31,193 --> 00:47:32,225
Yeah.

766
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:35,564
Judy Small thinks that
I should have an affair.

767
00:47:38,868 --> 00:47:43,603
She said I needed to even the sexual score because,
you know, Bob had that thing with Sheila.

768
00:47:43,605 --> 00:47:45,672
But that doesn't count. That
was before you were married.

769
00:47:45,674 --> 00:47:47,476
Judy Small seems
to think it counts.

770
00:47:50,212 --> 00:47:53,048
Maybe she just thinks you
need to have a little fun, huh?

771
00:47:56,118 --> 00:47:57,852
- Let's see what I have here.
- Oh, so...

772
00:47:57,854 --> 00:47:59,219
Yes.

773
00:47:59,221 --> 00:48:00,255
Have fun.

774
00:48:00,656 --> 00:48:02,122
Try these.

775
00:48:02,124 --> 00:48:03,623
In fact, take the bottle.

776
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:04,624
I can't take it anymore
'cause I'm pregnant.

777
00:48:04,626 --> 00:48:05,828
They'll help you unwind.

778
00:48:07,462 --> 00:48:09,262
I need to unwind.

779
00:48:09,264 --> 00:48:10,530
- You really do.
- I'm really stressed.

780
00:48:10,532 --> 00:48:11,400
- You really are.
- Okay.

781
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,633
- Ah.
- Mm-hmm.

782
00:48:13,635 --> 00:48:15,203
- Go on.
- Ahh.

783
00:48:36,425 --> 00:48:39,294
Yeah! You should get out more.

784
00:48:53,342 --> 00:48:55,776
Come on. We're going home.

785
00:48:55,778 --> 00:48:57,780
Right now. Now.

786
00:48:58,347 --> 00:48:58,881
This way.

787
00:48:59,682 --> 00:49:00,382
Bye.

788
00:49:02,284 --> 00:49:03,886
Wooh! Who's next?

789
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:10,158
Bob Howard,

790
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,563
you are a tight,

791
00:49:15,197 --> 00:49:19,566
secretive, little man.

792
00:49:19,568 --> 00:49:22,905
Jesus Christ! How much did
you have to drink tonight, huh?

793
00:49:23,605 --> 00:49:25,440
Oh, boo-hoo.

794
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:29,710
I guess you'll have to tell
your therapist all about it.

795
00:49:29,712 --> 00:49:30,813
Oh, wow!

796
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:35,916
Maybe I should have an affair.

797
00:49:35,918 --> 00:49:38,886
Yeah, maybe you should.
Why? Are you thinking about it?

798
00:49:38,888 --> 00:49:39,954
Maybe.

799
00:49:39,956 --> 00:49:41,287
You're incredible,
you know that?

800
00:49:41,289 --> 00:49:44,925
Do you mean me, or
do you mean Sheila?

801
00:49:44,927 --> 00:49:46,459
Sheila?

802
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:50,463
She must be on your mind or else you
wouldn't have told Judy Small about her.

803
00:49:50,465 --> 00:49:52,900
I didn't tell Judy Small
about her. You did.

804
00:49:52,902 --> 00:49:57,972
I didn't tell Judy Small about
your sexual transgressions.

805
00:49:57,974 --> 00:50:01,776
She told me that you told her so
don't pretend that you didn't.

806
00:50:01,778 --> 00:50:04,881
- This is so fucked up.
- Yeah, bingo!

807
00:50:05,514 --> 00:50:06,613
Your fault.

808
00:50:06,615 --> 00:50:08,015
- Bingo.
- Bingo.

809
00:50:08,017 --> 00:50:12,519
You know what, Susan? If you were
smart, you'd know that I'm a man.

810
00:50:12,521 --> 00:50:15,622
Yeah, such an attractive man.

811
00:50:15,624 --> 00:50:16,924
Yeah, that's right.

812
00:50:16,926 --> 00:50:19,559
I'm an attractive man
with needs of his own.

813
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:26,601
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha.

814
00:50:33,542 --> 00:50:36,946
You know, I'm... I'm
having a really hard time

815
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:42,785
getting comfortable with your
suggestion that I even the score.

816
00:50:43,518 --> 00:50:45,585
Is that what you think I said?

817
00:50:45,587 --> 00:50:46,989
That's what I know you said.

818
00:50:48,623 --> 00:50:52,729
I mean, you can't be implying that I'm
the one who said I should have an affair.

819
00:50:54,596 --> 00:50:56,864
I would entertain that idea.

820
00:50:56,866 --> 00:50:58,735
That's a very real possibility,

821
00:51:00,535 --> 00:51:06,441
and you can certainly grant me that you must
be finding your impulses pretty scary, hmm?

822
00:51:06,909 --> 00:51:09,846
Isn't that what you learned
by your behavior at the party?

823
00:51:10,545 --> 00:51:13,714
Bob said he didn't
tell you about Sheila.

824
00:51:13,716 --> 00:51:17,519
I can't discuss what
Bob said or didn't say.

825
00:51:18,955 --> 00:51:20,890
You know I don't think
you like me very much.

826
00:51:23,558 --> 00:51:24,659
This

827
00:51:25,762 --> 00:51:27,462
is going to help you

828
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:30,733
relax

829
00:51:31,968 --> 00:51:33,268
and open.

830
00:51:35,537 --> 00:51:36,571
Okay.

831
00:51:37,572 --> 00:51:38,941
Why don't you tell me

832
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:42,678
whatever is going
through your mind?

833
00:51:43,946 --> 00:51:45,280
All right. Uh...

834
00:51:46,682 --> 00:51:47,049
Oh!

835
00:51:48,151 --> 00:51:50,885
You know what? I had
the craziest dream last night.

836
00:51:50,887 --> 00:51:51,886
Oh.

837
00:51:51,888 --> 00:51:52,753
Yeah.

838
00:51:52,755 --> 00:51:53,653
Wow.

839
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:54,855
Tell me about it.

840
00:51:54,857 --> 00:51:55,657
Um...

841
00:51:57,559 --> 00:51:59,960
I was on this rowboat
with Annabelle.

842
00:51:59,962 --> 00:52:02,395
You know that woman
from work I told you about?

843
00:52:02,397 --> 00:52:03,898
Yes.

844
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:08,871
Yeah, so we were on this rowboat and...
and, you know, she's there and

845
00:52:10,539 --> 00:52:11,874
I'm watching a fish-

846
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:16,913
just luminescent fish
like a rainbow trout.

847
00:52:18,446 --> 00:52:24,086
And so, I'm... I turned back to
Annabelle and she's undressing.

848
00:52:24,821 --> 00:52:26,856
Actually, you know what? No.

849
00:52:27,924 --> 00:52:29,324
That's not true.

850
00:52:30,425 --> 00:52:33,996
I was undressing her,
and we are in a hotel room,

851
00:52:34,563 --> 00:52:38,801
and she was naked except
for this black brassiere.

852
00:52:41,436 --> 00:52:45,975
And she took the brassiere off,

853
00:52:46,575 --> 00:52:47,409
but

854
00:52:48,778 --> 00:52:50,510
when she did,

855
00:52:50,512 --> 00:52:53,613
I don't know, I get tangled up
around my head or something.

856
00:52:53,615 --> 00:52:55,017
I just... I couldn't
see anything.

857
00:52:55,885 --> 00:53:01,521
Even in your dreams your
sexual wish is frustrated.

858
00:53:01,523 --> 00:53:03,525
Yeah, that... that's
exactly what I thought.

859
00:53:04,026 --> 00:53:08,030
I was feeling frustrated
and entangled,

860
00:53:08,798 --> 00:53:14,003
then I was home, and I was
laying on the couch, and

861
00:53:14,636 --> 00:53:18,671
all of a sudden there was a loud
knock, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

862
00:53:18,673 --> 00:53:19,974
It was scary.

863
00:53:19,976 --> 00:53:22,710
I jumped out. My heart
was beating like a rabbit.

864
00:53:22,712 --> 00:53:24,577
I ran over to the door
and I answered it.

865
00:53:24,579 --> 00:53:28,883
Then there was this
woman standing there,

866
00:53:28,885 --> 00:53:32,853
but you couldn't see anything

867
00:53:32,855 --> 00:53:37,457
'cause it was nighttime, and there
was, you know, not a lot of light.

868
00:53:37,459 --> 00:53:38,959
I couldn't tell who it was.

869
00:53:38,961 --> 00:53:40,428
I think it was Annabelle,

870
00:53:43,799 --> 00:53:46,102
but I also think it
might have been you.

871
00:53:47,502 --> 00:53:48,436
Yes.

872
00:53:50,572 --> 00:53:51,539
Go on.

873
00:53:52,975 --> 00:53:54,409
And I-

874
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,949
and I felt this powerful desire,

875
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:02,484
and the end.

876
00:54:03,518 --> 00:54:04,186
It was really weird.

877
00:54:07,957 --> 00:54:12,661
It's so painful to feel that I
have to win your approval.

878
00:54:16,132 --> 00:54:18,265
Of course it's sexual.

879
00:54:18,267 --> 00:54:24,006
She's caster eating him, and there's
such just such agony to sit by and watch

880
00:54:24,673 --> 00:54:26,909
which is all you analysts
know how to do anyway.

881
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:31,546
Oh, how good
it would feel just

882
00:54:32,148 --> 00:54:33,714
to fire you.

883
00:54:33,716 --> 00:54:36,584
You know that?
Such a suck at chat.

884
00:54:40,022 --> 00:54:46,228
It's just so hard 'cause I'm doing
everything that I know how to do.

885
00:54:50,733 --> 00:54:53,033
I just know I'm right this time.

886
00:54:53,035 --> 00:54:55,235
It can't be what you say.

887
00:54:55,237 --> 00:54:56,538
It can't!

888
00:54:56,973 --> 00:54:58,538
It just can't.

889
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:00,176
I know it.

890
00:55:04,814 --> 00:55:09,615
And I've tried several times to reach
you, Judith, so please call me back.

891
00:55:09,617 --> 00:55:12,786
I'm in Los Angeles, and
you know the number.

892
00:55:12,788 --> 00:55:15,725
I... I look forward
to hearing from you.

893
00:55:17,659 --> 00:55:19,929
- I want to talk to you.
- Okay.

894
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:22,530
About the therapy.

895
00:55:23,332 --> 00:55:25,633
- Okay.
- I'm having second thoughts.

896
00:55:27,737 --> 00:55:29,739
Second thoughts, huh?

897
00:55:30,806 --> 00:55:31,639
Okay.

898
00:55:32,674 --> 00:55:33,741
Um...

899
00:55:33,743 --> 00:55:35,244
- Thank you.
- Thank you, baby.

900
00:55:36,578 --> 00:55:37,179
What is that?

901
00:55:38,014 --> 00:55:38,511
- I don't know.
- What's the problem?

902
00:55:38,513 --> 00:55:40,016
No return address.

903
00:55:47,123 --> 00:55:48,124
Hmm.

904
00:55:58,267 --> 00:55:59,735
Is there a note?

905
00:56:00,202 --> 00:56:01,203
Uh...

906
00:56:07,977 --> 00:56:08,641
No signature.

907
00:56:08,643 --> 00:56:09,810
Okay, but what does it say?

908
00:56:09,812 --> 00:56:11,247
It says "What you desire."

909
00:56:13,682 --> 00:56:15,149
Is this a joke?

910
00:56:15,151 --> 00:56:17,317
- Well, I didn't send it.
- Of course you didn't, but who the hell did?

911
00:56:17,319 --> 00:56:19,855
Don't ask me. I don't...
I'll call the company.

912
00:56:21,791 --> 00:56:23,223
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

913
00:56:23,225 --> 00:56:25,726
No, absolutely not.

914
00:56:25,728 --> 00:56:29,296
Okay, fine, whatever,
but I'm telling you this.

915
00:56:29,298 --> 00:56:31,867
I want us out of the therapy.

916
00:56:33,402 --> 00:56:34,802
What? You don't think...

917
00:56:34,804 --> 00:56:38,205
I don't know what to think,
but I want that woman out of our lives.

918
00:56:38,207 --> 00:56:40,309
You're breaking your
commitment to therapy.

919
00:56:42,044 --> 00:56:43,677
It hasn't worked for me.

920
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:47,981
Well, you refuse to open up,
but your need is bottomless.

921
00:56:47,983 --> 00:56:49,049
You're in flight.

922
00:56:49,051 --> 00:56:51,885
My needs are not bottomless.

923
00:56:51,887 --> 00:56:53,887
You're running away, Susan.

924
00:56:53,889 --> 00:56:55,322
No, I'm not.

925
00:56:55,324 --> 00:56:59,661
You are, but at the same
time you want my love.

926
00:57:00,296 --> 00:57:01,962
This is foul.

927
00:57:01,964 --> 00:57:06,300
You want my love, and you're willing to
undermine Bob in order to win in my eyes.

928
00:57:06,302 --> 00:57:07,801
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

929
00:57:07,803 --> 00:57:11,038
I have to get on a plane to San
Francisco tomorrow so I'm gonna go now.

930
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,073
Oh, to San Francisco?

931
00:57:13,075 --> 00:57:15,242
I am leaving and I
am not coming back.

932
00:57:15,244 --> 00:57:16,378
That is why I came here.

933
00:57:18,013 --> 00:57:20,914
Aren't you concerned about Bob and Louise
being alone together while you run off

934
00:57:20,916 --> 00:57:26,420
to San Francisco because you are
a morass of hungers and impulses,

935
00:57:26,422 --> 00:57:30,290
and you just jump into therapy,
and just as quickly you just jump right out

936
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:32,826
because you got to go.

937
00:57:32,828 --> 00:57:35,295
You got to go off
to San Francisco.

938
00:57:35,297 --> 00:57:39,066
Oh, not even a care about the
chaos that you leave in your wake.

939
00:57:39,068 --> 00:57:43,003
You think that you
don't need me?

940
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:45,274
I think you're the
one who needs help.

941
00:57:46,242 --> 00:57:47,374
You need me.

942
00:57:49,912 --> 00:57:52,281
Oh, Susan, you need me.

943
00:57:53,382 --> 00:57:55,784
You need me, Susan!

944
00:57:57,319 --> 00:57:59,054
You need me!

945
00:58:08,731 --> 00:58:09,431
Fuck!

946
00:58:11,834 --> 00:58:14,735
Oh, I hope I lose my mind.

947
00:58:14,737 --> 00:58:17,306
I hope I go crazy
and hallucinate.

948
00:58:23,479 --> 00:58:25,347
- Let me try.
- Wow.

949
00:58:29,785 --> 00:58:32,288
Hold it in, don't breathe.

950
00:58:35,157 --> 00:58:36,292
Your mom smokes pot?

951
00:58:41,063 --> 00:58:42,429
She's scared I'll find out.

952
00:58:42,431 --> 00:58:45,434
Well, you know what? My
mother is scared of doors.

953
00:58:47,303 --> 00:58:51,207
My mother is scared
of buttons. Why?

954
00:58:54,543 --> 00:58:58,214
My mother... my mother is
scared of the word mucus.

955
00:59:02,284 --> 00:59:06,253
My mother is scared
of the word horny.

956
00:59:06,255 --> 00:59:09,358
Oh, that's so gross.

957
00:59:10,793 --> 00:59:12,893
Oh, I'm starving.

958
00:59:12,895 --> 00:59:14,029
Let's order pizza.

959
00:59:40,589 --> 00:59:42,391
It's been a long time, Judith.

960
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,860
Two years, seven
months, nine days.

961
00:59:46,862 --> 00:59:49,229
I assume there's a reason
you hunted me down.

962
00:59:49,231 --> 00:59:51,467
Well, I wanted to talk to you.

963
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:53,102
Oh.

964
00:59:54,103 --> 00:59:55,135
Talk.

965
00:59:55,137 --> 00:59:56,372
I hate talk.

966
00:59:58,374 --> 00:59:59,174
Look,

967
01:00:00,242 --> 01:00:02,976
no one even knew that
you resumed your practice.

968
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:05,345
Why should they?
And why shouldn't I?

969
01:00:05,347 --> 01:00:09,116
Judith, please don't play
childish word games.

970
01:00:09,118 --> 01:00:11,285
You don't like word
games, Dr. Kingsley?

971
01:00:11,287 --> 01:00:16,023
- Judith.
- They stole... no, you stole my livelihood.

972
01:00:16,025 --> 01:00:17,291
I was framed.

973
01:00:17,293 --> 01:00:20,594
I understand how you felt, but
I did everything that I could.

974
01:00:20,596 --> 01:00:22,963
- No.
- Perhaps I could have done more but nonetheless I...

975
01:00:22,965 --> 01:00:24,031
No, no. I... I did.

976
01:00:24,033 --> 01:00:26,867
I did everything
for Benjamin Price.

977
01:00:26,869 --> 01:00:29,169
I did everything.

978
01:00:29,171 --> 01:00:34,076
I did more than any therapist on
earth would have done for him.

979
01:00:34,576 --> 01:00:39,081
No other ethical therapist in the
opinion of the licensing board.

980
01:00:40,049 --> 01:00:42,382
Look, Judith, it's not too late.

981
01:00:42,384 --> 01:00:48,090
You still have a chance to redeem yourself,
to appeal, and I will support you in that.

982
01:00:48,457 --> 01:00:51,491
Oh, God, spare me
the lecture, Dr. Kingsley.

983
01:00:51,493 --> 01:00:53,660
Look, you don't even
have a license to practice.

984
01:00:53,662 --> 01:00:54,995
It's California.

985
01:00:54,997 --> 01:00:56,596
Nobody here cares
about licenses.

986
01:00:56,598 --> 01:00:58,534
Judith, you're making
a mockery of me.

987
01:01:00,135 --> 01:01:01,769
Bingo!

988
01:01:01,771 --> 01:01:06,073
Look, you were always a challenge, but I
had hoped that you'd make more progress,

989
01:01:06,075 --> 01:01:10,077
that you'd dismantled some of
those self-destructive impulses.

990
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,147
I think you need
to return to therapy.

991
01:01:16,485 --> 01:01:17,651
You think I need more treatment?

992
01:01:17,653 --> 01:01:19,419
Well, we weren't
finished when you left.

993
01:01:19,421 --> 01:01:22,558
So you came here to rescue me?

994
01:01:23,459 --> 01:01:24,393
Is that what you did?

995
01:01:25,027 --> 01:01:26,560
Oh, it's so kind.

996
01:01:26,562 --> 01:01:33,435
Oh, Dr. Kingsley,
that is so, so dedicated.

997
01:01:34,036 --> 01:01:38,105
If you return to New York we
can complete your therapy there.

998
01:01:38,107 --> 01:01:42,511
Well, then why wait? Let's
do it right here, right now.

999
01:01:43,946 --> 01:01:46,048
Let's go, Dr. Kingsley.

1000
01:02:05,467 --> 01:02:12,072
What did you expect when you violate all
the tenets of neutrality when you follow me

1001
01:02:12,074 --> 01:02:16,576
like an animal, when you hunt me
down, when you violate my privacy?

1002
01:02:16,578 --> 01:02:21,515
I am such an interesting subject
to you, am I not, Dr. Kingsley?

1003
01:02:21,517 --> 01:02:25,051
Flattering yourselves? I
need you? I don't need you.

1004
01:02:25,053 --> 01:02:26,153
I don't.

1005
01:02:26,155 --> 01:02:28,555
Ask yourself this,
why are you here?

1006
01:02:28,557 --> 01:02:32,492
Why are you crossing boundaries
yet again, Dr. Kingsley?

1007
01:02:32,494 --> 01:02:35,629
Everything I learned,
I learned from you except

1008
01:02:35,631 --> 01:02:37,631
that when I needed you,
you abandoned me!

1009
01:02:37,633 --> 01:02:40,269
Bingo! Bingo! Bingo!

1010
01:02:40,669 --> 01:02:42,271
Judy!

1011
01:03:11,467 --> 01:03:12,199
Hello.

1012
01:03:12,201 --> 01:03:13,768
I thought you'd never answer.

1013
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:16,570
<i>I'm sorry. I was stumped
on at a crossword clue.</i>

1014
01:03:16,572 --> 01:03:19,072
I have to go in like two minutes.
I have dinner with Ronald.

1015
01:03:19,074 --> 01:03:20,542
Oh, yeah? Well, uh,

1016
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:23,410
I mean, how'd... how'd it go?
How'd the whole thing go?

1017
01:03:23,412 --> 01:03:27,347
The furniture was beautiful,
but I'd have to commute.

1018
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:31,353
Just, um, anyway,
can I say hi to Louise?

1019
01:03:32,789 --> 01:03:38,560
Um, no, I told Louise she
could spend the night at Zoe's.

1020
01:03:42,364 --> 01:03:43,232
Um,

1021
01:03:44,399 --> 01:03:45,467
what are you gonna do tonight?

1022
01:03:46,168 --> 01:03:47,102
<i>Nothing.</i>

1023
01:03:48,136 --> 01:03:50,339
I'm doing the crossword,
gonna eat some pizza,

1024
01:03:50,807 --> 01:03:55,208
probably look at pictures of
cars I can't buy on the internet.

1025
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:56,512
I love you.

1026
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,481
I love you.

1027
01:04:14,697 --> 01:04:19,134
Well, some stupid clue.

1028
01:04:39,621 --> 01:04:40,788
Hi.

1029
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:42,057
Hello.

1030
01:04:44,126 --> 01:04:45,325
Is Susan here?

1031
01:04:45,327 --> 01:04:49,296
No, no, actually. No, she's
not. She's in San Francisco.

1032
01:04:49,298 --> 01:04:50,599
San Francisco?

1033
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:52,434
Yeah.

1034
01:04:53,803 --> 01:04:55,170
Back tomorrow.

1035
01:05:01,176 --> 01:05:02,812
I'm sorry. Would
you like to come in?

1036
01:05:10,419 --> 01:05:15,655
You know, sometimes I just wanna
light a light bulb, just like that,

1037
01:05:15,657 --> 01:05:22,662
I guess, snap and fly a
bike with E.T., you know,

1038
01:05:22,664 --> 01:05:24,598
- like a, b, c, d...
- What?

1039
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,535
- What did you say?
- E. T., j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, TV.

1040
01:05:28,537 --> 01:05:30,838
You wanna watch E.T.?

1041
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,773
No.

1042
01:05:32,775 --> 01:05:38,246
I wanna fly a bike
with E.T., you know?

1043
01:05:38,948 --> 01:05:40,647
You wanna know something sad?

1044
01:05:40,649 --> 01:05:41,615
Um?

1045
01:05:41,617 --> 01:05:45,686
See, if I were to find
an alien, I'd kill him.

1046
01:05:45,688 --> 01:05:47,822
Don't even look at me.

1047
01:05:47,824 --> 01:05:48,889
- That's...
- I'm looking.

1048
01:05:49,726 --> 01:05:50,459
Shit!

1049
01:05:57,633 --> 01:05:58,801
Hey, Mom.

1050
01:06:11,781 --> 01:06:12,947
How's Louise?

1051
01:06:12,949 --> 01:06:15,382
Louise? She's staying over
at her friend's house tonight.

1052
01:06:15,384 --> 01:06:17,350
Oh! Slumber party.

1053
01:06:17,352 --> 01:06:18,953
That's right, yeah.

1054
01:06:18,955 --> 01:06:20,455
Please, sit down.

1055
01:06:24,761 --> 01:06:29,697
You know, as much as I was
hoping to see all three of you,

1056
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:32,401
I'm actually quite
happy that it's just you.

1057
01:06:33,468 --> 01:06:34,937
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1058
01:06:35,671 --> 01:06:36,806
How's that?

1059
01:06:37,774 --> 01:06:39,807
Why do you look so scared, Bob?

1060
01:06:39,809 --> 01:06:43,412
I'm not scared. I... it's just,

1061
01:06:43,913 --> 01:06:47,850
you know, it's unusual when your
therapist drops by your house.

1062
01:06:49,719 --> 01:06:55,858
Yes, it is very unorthodox,
I will grant you that.

1063
01:06:56,458 --> 01:06:57,960
Do you want me to leave?

1064
01:06:59,594 --> 01:07:00,763
No, I'm not...

1065
01:07:01,998 --> 01:07:05,233
I don't want to be rude. I... no.

1066
01:07:10,405 --> 01:07:11,339
Come sit.

1067
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:22,852
I have to tell you something.

1068
01:07:29,391 --> 01:07:34,594
I've received some just
very devastating news.

1069
01:07:34,596 --> 01:07:36,298
I have to leave LA.

1070
01:07:36,899 --> 01:07:41,035
I have to leave and I don't
expect to come back.

1071
01:07:41,037 --> 01:07:42,705
I don't have a lot of time.

1072
01:07:43,672 --> 01:07:46,876
And I feel like we have some
unfinished business, you and I.

1073
01:07:49,377 --> 01:07:50,479
Do you?

1074
01:07:51,513 --> 01:07:54,917
This is... I...

1075
01:08:00,455 --> 01:08:03,458
What if you just sit back,

1076
01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:08,263
relax,

1077
01:08:10,066 --> 01:08:11,868
and allow yourself

1078
01:08:13,368 --> 01:08:17,606
to use this very last chance

1079
01:08:20,375 --> 01:08:21,844
to free yourself?

1080
01:08:22,912 --> 01:08:24,881
Have you two been
smoking marijuana?

1081
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:28,951
Uh-uh.

1082
01:08:29,752 --> 01:08:33,522
It looks like you two have
been smoking marijuana.

1083
01:08:35,457 --> 01:08:36,424
Yeah.

1084
01:08:38,761 --> 01:08:41,095
All right. We are taking
Louise home right now.

1085
01:08:41,097 --> 01:08:43,532
Now, just allow yourself

1086
01:08:45,367 --> 01:08:47,069
to relax

1087
01:08:48,537 --> 01:08:54,710
and drop in to this
present moment.

1088
01:08:55,978 --> 01:08:57,914
A moment

1089
01:08:59,481 --> 01:09:01,449
where you can remember

1090
01:09:03,019 --> 01:09:04,553
who you are.

1091
01:09:08,825 --> 01:09:10,625
Do you remember who you are?

1092
01:09:12,427 --> 01:09:13,528
I don't know.

1093
01:09:16,966 --> 01:09:17,934
I don't know.

1094
01:09:18,533 --> 01:09:20,167
Have I told you you're a man?

1095
01:09:20,169 --> 01:09:21,836
- Hmm.
- You're a man, right?

1096
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:22,738
Mm-hmm.

1097
01:09:23,139 --> 01:09:24,941
A man has needs.

1098
01:09:26,876 --> 01:09:31,946
Lots and lots of needs.

1099
01:09:31,948 --> 01:09:34,984
When no one hears those needs,

1100
01:09:35,685 --> 01:09:37,519
when those needs aren't met,

1101
01:09:38,821 --> 01:09:40,823
a man can forget himself.

1102
01:09:43,025 --> 01:09:45,094
Did you forget yourself, Bob?

1103
01:09:46,996 --> 01:09:51,968
What if I told you
that you could have

1104
01:09:58,174 --> 01:10:02,111
anything you

1105
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:08,784
wanted?

1106
01:10:09,886 --> 01:10:12,086
Bye.

1107
01:10:12,088 --> 01:10:15,189
Don't tell your mom that I yelled at you.
I want to remain in her social circle.

1108
01:10:15,191 --> 01:10:16,656
I don't wanna be shunned.

1109
01:10:16,658 --> 01:10:17,592
Go.

1110
01:10:18,127 --> 01:10:19,626
- I love you.
- I love you more.

1111
01:10:19,628 --> 01:10:21,896
Hey, we'll say goodbye 'cause you're
allowed to see your friend again.

1112
01:10:21,898 --> 01:10:22,930
That's how it works.

1113
01:10:22,932 --> 01:10:23,797
There's nothing
wrong with that.

1114
01:10:23,799 --> 01:10:25,598
You lied to us, such
a party pooper.

1115
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,437
Not if you're laughing
when you forgot...

1116
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,155
Oh, my God.

1117
01:10:46,856 --> 01:10:48,691
<i>Mommy's gonna kill you!</i>

1118
01:10:49,191 --> 01:10:51,160
- Louise.
- Go away!

1119
01:10:51,827 --> 01:10:53,794
- Please come inside.
- Go away!

1120
01:10:53,796 --> 01:10:56,631
- It's cold out here.
- Leave me alone!

1121
01:10:59,068 --> 01:11:00,169
Go!

1122
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:13,683
Uh,

1123
01:11:15,685 --> 01:11:16,218
whoa.

1124
01:11:17,887 --> 01:11:19,720
I feel so good to be home.

1125
01:11:19,722 --> 01:11:21,956
Yeah, we're very happy
to have you home.

1126
01:11:21,958 --> 01:11:25,127
That guy was such a jerk.
Oh, my God. It was embarrassing.

1127
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:42,477
Sweetie, are you alright?

1128
01:11:45,715 --> 01:11:47,715
Do you want to come out
from underneath that hoodie

1129
01:11:47,717 --> 01:11:50,086
and tell me what happened?
'Cause I can tell that something happened.

1130
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,162
Uh, is somebody dead?

1131
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:03,065
Jesus Christ!
What the hell happened?

1132
01:12:03,799 --> 01:12:07,301
I came home last night and Bob
was on the couch with Judy Small,

1133
01:12:07,303 --> 01:12:09,238
and it was really, really gross.

1134
01:12:18,147 --> 01:12:21,715
Judy Small? The therapist
was in our house?

1135
01:12:21,717 --> 01:12:26,120
Naked, and they were on the couch
doing stuff, and he was wearing a mask.

1136
01:12:26,122 --> 01:12:30,558
First of all, let me just say that...
that I'm sorry, and no one was naked.

1137
01:12:32,061 --> 01:12:35,896
I let... I let something
terrible happen but...

1138
01:12:35,898 --> 01:12:39,601
How can there be a but?
I mean, and in front of Louise?

1139
01:12:40,069 --> 01:12:42,271
Louise, sweetheart,
please go to your room.

1140
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:49,309
Susan, as God is my witness, the woman...
the woman came here to seduce me.

1141
01:12:49,311 --> 01:12:51,145
I think I'm gonna vomit.

1142
01:12:51,147 --> 01:12:52,846
I'm not pleading innocence.

1143
01:12:52,848 --> 01:12:54,116
Oh!

1144
01:12:55,617 --> 01:13:00,254
My therapist, our fucking
marriage counselor,

1145
01:13:00,256 --> 01:13:04,691
on the first night in our
marriage that I go away?

1146
01:13:04,693 --> 01:13:07,061
I didn't... I didn't
invite her here.

1147
01:13:07,063 --> 01:13:09,363
The whole thing is
just fucking insane.

1148
01:13:09,365 --> 01:13:13,200
You were naked wearing a mask.

1149
01:13:13,202 --> 01:13:19,239
I'm trying... I'm trying to tell you
that under the circumstances the mistake-

1150
01:13:19,241 --> 01:13:26,080
the very egregious and indefensible mistake
was it was very difficult to resist...

1151
01:13:26,082 --> 01:13:30,784
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1152
01:13:31,653 --> 01:13:32,719
Susan, you don't...

1153
01:13:32,721 --> 01:13:35,823
I swear to God I'll do it
when you're sleeping.

1154
01:13:35,825 --> 01:13:38,859
I'm gonna stab you in the
heart with a meat thermometer.

1155
01:13:38,861 --> 01:13:42,597
I'm gonna cut off your
balls with a corkscrew.

1156
01:13:43,032 --> 01:13:44,865
Susie, you don't have
to be reacting this way.

1157
01:13:44,867 --> 01:13:47,034
- Just...
- Just get out of here. I want you out now.

1158
01:13:47,036 --> 01:13:48,268
- Please.
- Get out?

1159
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:50,973
Please, just go.
I don't wanna see your face!

1160
01:13:52,041 --> 01:13:54,677
Go! Get out!

1161
01:14:48,097 --> 01:14:51,033
Let's get a one room,
please, just me.

1162
01:14:52,968 --> 01:14:54,270
Stay overnight.

1163
01:16:11,513 --> 01:16:12,879
Judy.

1164
01:16:24,994 --> 01:16:26,295
Have a good day.

1165
01:16:39,875 --> 01:16:42,843
Bob, what a splendid surprise.

1166
01:16:42,845 --> 01:16:46,413
Oh, sorry, I tried to call your cell, and
then your home number wasn't listed though.

1167
01:16:46,415 --> 01:16:48,849
- Well...
- I didn't know how else to find you.

1168
01:16:48,851 --> 01:16:52,619
I've been very busy packing,
making arrangements.

1169
01:16:52,621 --> 01:16:54,056
Hmm.

1170
01:16:55,391 --> 01:16:56,358
Have a seat.

1171
01:17:00,396 --> 01:17:01,397
It's okay.

1172
01:17:13,642 --> 01:17:15,442
Uh...

1173
01:17:15,444 --> 01:17:24,186
I came here today to ask you to talk to Susan
for me and maybe just explain things to her.

1174
01:17:27,022 --> 01:17:28,157
Darling,

1175
01:17:32,394 --> 01:17:33,495
you're so scared,

1176
01:17:34,963 --> 01:17:36,496
cornered, misunderstood.

1177
01:17:36,498 --> 01:17:38,934
No, I love my wife,

1178
01:17:40,102 --> 01:17:42,135
and I don't want to lose her.

1179
01:17:42,137 --> 01:17:43,904
Of course you don't.

1180
01:17:43,906 --> 01:17:49,912
So please, please just talk to her and just
tell her that this whole thing was insane.

1181
01:17:50,946 --> 01:17:51,947
Insane?

1182
01:17:52,448 --> 01:17:53,349
Yes.

1183
01:18:03,525 --> 01:18:10,130
I would do almost anything for you
so, yeah, okay, I could talk to Susan.

1184
01:18:10,132 --> 01:18:11,300
I could tell her... um,

1185
01:18:12,736 --> 01:18:17,373
I could tell her that it wasn't
you who undressed me, but it was I

1186
01:18:17,973 --> 01:18:21,009
who undressed you, and you

1187
01:18:22,044 --> 01:18:23,178
didn't take me,

1188
01:18:24,446 --> 01:18:29,216
but I who hoped in the course
of one reckless erotic journey...

1189
01:18:29,218 --> 01:18:30,852
Maybe this was a bad idea.

1190
01:18:30,854 --> 01:18:35,290
Oh, just enough with the flagellation over
a lousy blowjob, please, it's insulting.

1191
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:40,262
Seriously, you
need to relax, Bob.

1192
01:18:41,997 --> 01:18:43,196
Let's do this.

1193
01:18:43,198 --> 01:18:45,200
Let's do a calming exercise.

1194
01:18:46,201 --> 01:18:48,736
I'm nervous, and
now I'm exhausted.

1195
01:18:48,738 --> 01:18:52,072
Just a nice breathing exercise.
Can you do that for me?

1196
01:18:52,074 --> 01:18:55,342
Please, please, Judy,
will you just talk to Susan?

1197
01:18:55,344 --> 01:19:00,516
I will talk to Susan if you promise me
that you're gonna do this for me, okay?

1198
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:02,649
You're gonna be a good boy.

1199
01:19:02,651 --> 01:19:04,219
Yeah, I will do
anything you want.

1200
01:19:04,721 --> 01:19:08,689
Okay. You're gonna count
from 10 down to one.

1201
01:19:08,691 --> 01:19:11,393
Okay? 10...

1202
01:19:13,495 --> 01:19:14,494
Ten.

1203
01:19:14,496 --> 01:19:15,431
Nine.

1204
01:19:27,309 --> 01:19:29,344
You are not listening to me.

1205
01:19:30,512 --> 01:19:32,078
There's no more money.

1206
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,147
It's all gone. Everything.

1207
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:37,284
Nicky invested every single penny
of our money with that lying bitch,

1208
01:19:37,286 --> 01:19:39,054
and she just cut and ran.

1209
01:19:39,621 --> 01:19:42,222
What are you doing here?

1210
01:19:42,224 --> 01:19:43,657
I live here, remember?

1211
01:19:43,659 --> 01:19:45,127
Oh, God, don't remind me.

1212
01:19:46,462 --> 01:19:49,565
I just spent $200, money we don't
have, unblocking my energy.

1213
01:19:50,232 --> 01:19:52,735
One word from him,
money down the drain.

1214
01:19:54,536 --> 01:19:56,205
I guess Roxy told
you the bad news.

1215
01:19:56,773 --> 01:19:57,738
Yeah.

1216
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:59,272
Don't talk.

1217
01:19:59,274 --> 01:20:02,044
Okay? Just don't make a sound.

1218
01:20:03,111 --> 01:20:04,244
How's Bob?

1219
01:20:04,246 --> 01:20:05,512
I don't know.

1220
01:20:05,514 --> 01:20:07,247
I don't care.

1221
01:20:07,249 --> 01:20:10,517
I heard there's some weird shit going down
at his place, some kind of slash-and-burn.

1222
01:20:10,519 --> 01:20:16,323
Why are you here? Why aren't you out
looking for a job? What about our babies?

1223
01:20:16,325 --> 01:20:18,558
Yeah, actually, I was thinking
about getting a tattoo.

1224
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,061
You cannot afford a tattoo.

1225
01:20:21,063 --> 01:20:24,765
You cannot afford to take a shit on
the ground that you're standing on.

1226
01:20:24,767 --> 01:20:26,435
I can shit anywhere I like.

1227
01:20:28,237 --> 01:20:29,204
I hate him.

1228
01:20:30,172 --> 01:20:31,607
I really fucking hate him.

1229
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:33,674
I hate his guts.

1230
01:20:33,676 --> 01:20:37,079
Yeah, I hate them. I
hate them. I hate them all.

1231
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,346
How many tranquilizers
do you need?

1232
01:20:39,348 --> 01:20:40,681
Oh, I'll take as many
as you can spare.

1233
01:20:40,683 --> 01:20:42,618
Oh, honey, I got plenty.

1234
01:20:49,191 --> 01:20:53,326
Oh, Nick is gonna find
a job, sweetie, he is.

1235
01:20:53,328 --> 01:20:55,097
Susan, he's a writer.

1236
01:20:55,531 --> 01:20:56,799
What the fuck can a writer do?

1237
01:21:01,738 --> 01:21:02,571
Good morning.

1238
01:21:04,206 --> 01:21:05,374
Ooh, ouch.

1239
01:21:07,576 --> 01:21:09,444
Ooh, that looked painful.

1240
01:21:10,112 --> 01:21:12,145
I'm so sorry.

1241
01:21:12,147 --> 01:21:14,616
Hey, don't be mad at me.

1242
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:19,321
Hey, I never meant to hurt you.

1243
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:22,792
It's weird he hasn't called.

1244
01:21:25,527 --> 01:21:27,394
I bet something bad happened.

1245
01:21:27,396 --> 01:21:30,463
Oh, no, Louise. Don't say that.

1246
01:21:30,465 --> 01:21:33,368
I mean, he's dumb,
but he's not that dumb.

1247
01:21:34,136 --> 01:21:36,469
Like, if he were okay he'd call.

1248
01:21:36,471 --> 01:21:39,239
Maybe you should call him.

1249
01:21:39,241 --> 01:21:41,343
Why? He's your husband.

1250
01:21:41,811 --> 01:21:46,548
It would be such a human
gesture, a forgiving thing,

1251
01:21:47,282 --> 01:21:54,656
considering the fact that even as
inadequate as he is, he loves you.

1252
01:22:05,802 --> 01:22:07,870
Bet you've got him
to an accident.

1253
01:22:11,506 --> 01:22:12,374
Hello?

1254
01:22:12,842 --> 01:22:13,874
It's Louise.

1255
01:22:13,876 --> 01:22:14,777
Is Bob there?

1256
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,648
Well, do you know where he is?

1257
01:22:20,582 --> 01:22:21,583
Never?

1258
01:22:22,217 --> 01:22:23,285
Okay, bye.

1259
01:22:24,954 --> 01:22:29,623
He never showed up at work even though he
had a meeting with the writer from Alaska.

1260
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:31,560
Something's definitely wrong.

1261
01:22:33,662 --> 01:22:36,697
So much is wrong,
I don't even know where...

1262
01:22:36,699 --> 01:22:40,701
Well, he... he... he could be in
jail, or bleeding to death somewhere.

1263
01:22:40,703 --> 01:22:42,703
- Louise.
- Or else he could have a heart attack.

1264
01:22:42,705 --> 01:22:44,805
- Don't say that.
- I'm sorry.

1265
01:22:44,807 --> 01:22:46,941
I can tell you're
already freaking out.

1266
01:22:46,943 --> 01:22:50,543
I'm not freaking out.
I'm just a little tired.

1267
01:22:50,545 --> 01:22:52,614
I think we're better
off facing the truth.

1268
01:22:53,649 --> 01:22:56,549
I'm having a very
painful realization.

1269
01:22:56,551 --> 01:22:57,285
What?

1270
01:22:59,822 --> 01:23:01,989
I still love Bob.

1271
01:23:01,991 --> 01:23:05,327
Oh, my God. I thought
that's why you married him.

1272
01:23:07,262 --> 01:23:11,899
It's crazy how easy it is to forget
how much someone means to you

1273
01:23:11,901 --> 01:23:20,475
even if they've been a complete
reptile, all their fuck-ups and flaws.

1274
01:23:21,978 --> 01:23:25,445
Oh, baby, if anything ever happened
to him I don't know if I...

1275
01:23:25,447 --> 01:23:26,346
Mom, not now.

1276
01:23:26,348 --> 01:23:27,482
Okay.

1277
01:23:31,988 --> 01:23:34,554
I bet you it has something
to do with Judy Small.

1278
01:23:34,556 --> 01:23:35,756
Judy Small.

1279
01:23:35,758 --> 01:23:36,824
Judy Small.

1280
01:23:36,826 --> 01:23:38,226
Judy.

1281
01:23:42,364 --> 01:23:43,231
Judy?

1282
01:24:00,783 --> 01:24:01,918
Filed a report.

1283
01:24:03,385 --> 01:24:07,387
If we haven't heard from him in 24
hours, we'll just have to come back.

1284
01:24:07,389 --> 01:24:08,756
Well, that's dumb.

1285
01:24:08,758 --> 01:24:09,992
What if tomorrow is too late?

1286
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:13,326
I can't make you
a little cozier.

1287
01:24:13,328 --> 01:24:15,328
- Can you help me out here, babe?
- Judy.

1288
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:16,396
Judy.

1289
01:24:16,398 --> 01:24:18,598
- Judy.
- What? What?

1290
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:19,834
You can't do this.

1291
01:24:19,836 --> 01:24:21,301
Judy, you can't do this.

1292
01:24:21,303 --> 01:24:22,739
You can't keep me prisoner.

1293
01:24:24,406 --> 01:24:25,474
Get it straight.

1294
01:24:26,508 --> 01:24:28,075
I'm leaving tonight, and
you're coming with me.

1295
01:24:28,077 --> 01:24:30,477
Maybe he's glad that he left me.

1296
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:31,580
He's not.

1297
01:24:32,481 --> 01:24:35,482
Oh, God, I really don't want...

1298
01:24:35,484 --> 01:24:37,584
When I saw them
naked on that couch...

1299
01:24:37,586 --> 01:24:38,585
He... he is.

1300
01:24:38,587 --> 01:24:40,386
All naked and crawled
up like two white dogs.

1301
01:24:40,388 --> 01:24:41,055
Louise!

1302
01:24:41,057 --> 01:24:42,959
Mom, you're gonna blow it!

1303
01:24:44,026 --> 01:24:45,993
I think I'm blowing it.

1304
01:24:45,995 --> 01:24:48,263
- What are you doing?
- No, you're not.

1305
01:24:48,798 --> 01:24:50,865
I'm sorry!

1306
01:24:50,867 --> 01:24:55,337
Susan and I came to you
because we needed your help.

1307
01:24:55,905 --> 01:25:00,743
Every child wants a
grownup who will pretend

1308
01:25:01,476 --> 01:25:03,713
so I'm gonna tell you
what we're going to do.

1309
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:10,519
We're going to drive, and then we're going to
fly, and then we're gonna head towards water

1310
01:25:11,854 --> 01:25:21,329
because I see a white sail against
just the most ethereal blue sky.

1311
01:25:23,099 --> 01:25:26,633
Mom, we need to go now
to Judy Small's office.

1312
01:25:26,635 --> 01:25:27,768
Not planned.

1313
01:25:27,770 --> 01:25:30,938
Hands on the wheel
and eyes on the road.

1314
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:31,806
Thank you.

1315
01:25:31,808 --> 01:25:33,743
I know the fires in need.

1316
01:25:34,609 --> 01:25:35,845
I know the truth.

1317
01:25:36,813 --> 01:25:41,449
I know the truth but
Dr. Kingsley says

1318
01:25:42,417 --> 01:25:45,888
human beings suffer from
reminiscences, Judith.

1319
01:25:46,823 --> 01:25:49,792
You... you suffer from nothing.

1320
01:25:50,827 --> 01:25:54,128
Somewhere there is
a human life for you.

1321
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:57,630
Judy, I love my wife.

1322
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:59,334
And yet

1323
01:26:01,137 --> 01:26:03,338
I pretend you love me,

1324
01:26:04,907 --> 01:26:06,709
and you must pretend the same.

1325
01:26:08,811 --> 01:26:10,680
I'm calling 911.

1326
01:26:11,147 --> 01:26:12,048
Come on, baby.

1327
01:26:13,015 --> 01:26:14,382
Coming.

1328
01:26:26,762 --> 01:26:28,595
We should break down the door.

1329
01:26:28,597 --> 01:26:31,832
Yes. We need something.
We need like, um, like a hammer or-

1330
01:26:31,834 --> 01:26:32,766
- Wait, go ask that guy.
- Okay.

1331
01:26:32,768 --> 01:26:33,635
Ask him for help.

1332
01:26:34,569 --> 01:26:35,568
Mom, money.

1333
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:36,770
You don't need money.

1334
01:26:36,772 --> 01:26:38,504
- Okay.
- Bob!

1335
01:26:38,506 --> 01:26:39,505
Susan!

1336
01:26:39,507 --> 01:26:41,008
Judy!

1337
01:26:41,010 --> 01:26:45,145
- Help!
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

1338
01:26:45,147 --> 01:26:47,715
- You need help?
- Yes, he... my husband is in there.

1339
01:26:47,717 --> 01:26:49,515
- You sure he's in there?
- Yes, I'm positive. He's in there.

1340
01:26:49,517 --> 01:26:50,853
- Please, just break the lock.
- Okay. Okay.

1341
01:26:52,788 --> 01:26:54,021
I hear Bob.

1342
01:26:54,023 --> 01:26:55,024
Shhh!

1343
01:26:58,828 --> 01:27:01,130
- Okay, I got it.
- Okay. You stay.

1344
01:27:03,165 --> 01:27:05,799
- Bob!
- Susan!

1345
01:27:05,801 --> 01:27:06,499
Where's Bob?

1346
01:27:06,501 --> 01:27:07,801
Mom! That's Judy. That's Judy.

1347
01:27:07,803 --> 01:27:10,804
Hey, whoa, whoa. Where are you going?
Just relax, lady, okay?

1348
01:27:10,806 --> 01:27:11,872
- Ahh.
- Gah, aw. God.

1349
01:27:11,874 --> 01:27:13,140
Hey, hey, what's going on here?

1350
01:27:13,142 --> 01:27:14,540
Help. Just let me go. Help.

1351
01:27:14,542 --> 01:27:15,575
- Let her go, now.
- No, no, but no...

1352
01:27:15,577 --> 01:27:17,978
What are you doing?
Don't let her go! Get her!

1353
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:19,547
- She just bit me, man. She's crazy.
- Go!

1354
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:22,018
Oh, my God.

1355
01:27:27,555 --> 01:27:29,725
I was so scared.

1356
01:27:33,262 --> 01:27:35,729
- I'm sorry.
- Susan, Susan, Susan, my Susan.

1357
01:27:35,731 --> 01:27:36,431
Bob.

1358
01:27:43,773 --> 01:27:45,039
No, stay back.

1359
01:27:45,041 --> 01:27:45,906
I'm gonna jump.

1360
01:27:45,908 --> 01:27:48,208
2546, we need a
jumper squad right away.

1361
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:49,712
- Hey, look.
- Mom.

1362
01:27:52,048 --> 01:27:52,848
Judy!

1363
01:27:58,721 --> 01:28:00,522
You okay? Yeah.

1364
01:28:01,057 --> 01:28:02,790
Whoa, what are you doing?
You shouldn't be up here.

1365
01:28:02,792 --> 01:28:03,791
- Stand down.
- It's okay.

1366
01:28:03,793 --> 01:28:06,026
I know her. I know her.
It's okay. It's okay.

1367
01:28:06,028 --> 01:28:07,462
She's my therapist.

1368
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:11,734
Judy.

1369
01:28:12,201 --> 01:28:12,935
Judy.

1370
01:28:14,236 --> 01:28:14,904
Hey.

1371
01:28:17,605 --> 01:28:18,473
Hey, Bob.

1372
01:28:19,041 --> 01:28:20,042
What are you doing?

1373
01:28:23,112 --> 01:28:25,245
Now, come on. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

1374
01:28:25,247 --> 01:28:26,514
This isn't you.

1375
01:28:27,016 --> 01:28:27,717
No, come on.

1376
01:28:28,284 --> 01:28:30,150
Come on, Judy.
You don't do this.

1377
01:28:30,152 --> 01:28:31,887
Judy Small doesn't do this.

1378
01:28:32,855 --> 01:28:33,990
No, you don't.

1379
01:28:37,827 --> 01:28:39,095
Yeah, I've got you.

1380
01:28:39,729 --> 01:28:41,831
Let me help you now. Come on.

1381
01:28:42,732 --> 01:28:43,565
Yeah?

1382
01:28:45,801 --> 01:28:48,037
Okay. Okay. Oh, oh, okay.

1383
01:28:48,704 --> 01:28:50,304
I've got you. I've got you.

1384
01:28:50,306 --> 01:28:51,173
Okay.

1385
01:28:53,575 --> 01:28:54,176
Okay.

1386
01:28:59,614 --> 01:29:00,548
Lover.

1387
01:29:02,084 --> 01:29:02,985
Jewel.

1388
01:29:27,810 --> 01:29:29,178
What are you doing home?

1389
01:29:31,147 --> 01:29:32,580
I have bad news.

1390
01:29:33,315 --> 01:29:34,250
What?

1391
01:29:35,317 --> 01:29:36,285
I got fired.

1392
01:29:38,988 --> 01:29:42,022
How can they fire you?
You have a contract.

1393
01:29:42,024 --> 01:29:45,194
I know. I know. They're gonna buy
me out for 30 cents on the dollar.

1394
01:29:46,128 --> 01:29:47,296
Well, what happened?

1395
01:29:49,398 --> 01:29:52,667
There was this thing with...
with Reed and Walter,

1396
01:29:53,269 --> 01:29:56,336
and I didn't tell you about it because
I wanted to wait until it was done

1397
01:29:56,338 --> 01:29:59,940
so I could come to you and say,
here it is, here's the new deal.

1398
01:29:59,942 --> 01:30:00,974
Here's the big money.

1399
01:30:00,976 --> 01:30:02,311
Here's the new salary.

1400
01:30:03,578 --> 01:30:07,750
And Beaver found out about it,
and told us to pack our bags.

1401
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:16,356
Look, Susan, I know how bad this
looks, but I'm gonna find another job.

1402
01:30:16,358 --> 01:30:17,659
You don't have to worry.

1403
01:30:20,963 --> 01:30:26,100
You've been fired and we
have no income to speak of,

1404
01:30:26,102 --> 01:30:28,571
and almost no savings.

1405
01:30:34,443 --> 01:30:35,377
But

1406
01:30:39,448 --> 01:30:41,050
at least we have each other.

1407
01:30:43,953 --> 01:30:45,387
Shit.

1408
01:30:51,927 --> 01:30:52,928
Does that hurt?

1409
01:30:53,329 --> 01:30:55,295
Not too much.

1410
01:30:55,297 --> 01:30:57,297
- Good.
- Not anymore.

1411
01:30:57,299 --> 01:30:58,834
Being a tough guy?

1412
01:31:11,247 --> 01:31:14,715
If we hurry we still have time
before Louise gets home.

1413
01:31:14,717 --> 01:31:15,684
Yeah.

1414
01:31:29,832 --> 01:31:30,733
Hello?

1415
01:31:32,234 --> 01:31:34,537
Oh!

1416
01:31:38,407 --> 01:31:41,010
- That's weird.
- Yeah.

1417
01:31:43,245 --> 01:31:44,947
You know what that means?

1418
01:31:46,182 --> 01:31:47,915
Oh, God.

1419
01:31:47,917 --> 01:31:49,318
So gross.

1420
01:31:51,353 --> 01:31:53,487
They barely even
talk to each other.

1421
01:31:53,489 --> 01:31:54,588
Eww.

1422
01:31:54,590 --> 01:31:58,694
Aren't married people
supposed to do it at night?

1423
01:32:02,865 --> 01:32:04,900
- I'm starving.
- Me too.
