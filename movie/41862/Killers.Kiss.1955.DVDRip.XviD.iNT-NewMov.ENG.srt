1
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:48,635
<i>It's crazy how you can get yourself
in a mess sometimes</i>

2
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:52,040
<i>and not even be able
to think about it with any sense,</i>

3
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,137
<i>and yet not be able to think
about anything else.</i>

4
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:59,273
<i>You get so you're no good
for anything or anybody.</i>

5
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:02,582
<i>Maybe it begins
by taking life too serious.</i>

6
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:06,291
<i>Anyway, I think
that's the way it began for me...</i>

7
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:11,092
<i>... just before my fight
with Rodriguez three days ago.</i>

8
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,752
- Hello?
- Hello, Davey.

9
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,792
<i>- You're a half-hour late.
- How are you?</i>

10
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,885
<i>It's getting late, and I don't like
waiting around like this.</i>

11
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:25,020
You better hop a cab.

12
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,895
I had some trouble with the car,
and it's still tied up at the shop.

13
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,833
<i>- I'll meet you over at the arena.
- I'll see you there.</i>

14
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,029
Right. Bye.

15
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,640
- You're doing all right for yourself.
- What do you mean?

16
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,011
He just lives in the building.

17
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,575
He used to be a pretty good fighter.

18
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,172
- A fighter?
- Sure.

19
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,616
He's fighting tonight,
as a matter of fact.

20
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,484
We can watch him on the TV.

21
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,726
<i>Dear Davey,</i>

22
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,397
<i>We still haven't heard from you
yet this month,</i>

23
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,805
<i>and we wondered whether everything
was still all right with you.</i>

24
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:27,436
<i>Out here,
everything's about the same.</i>

25
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:31,448
<i>I still get into Seattle every week,
and the ranch is prospering nicely.</i>

26
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:36,647
<i>Last week, I finally bought
Mr. Henderson's chestnut Arabian stallion.</i>

27
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,520
<i>Your Aunt Grace's arthritis
is much better.</i>

28
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,391
<i>She can even take short rides
on Jumper now and then.</i>

29
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,264
<i>Well, I guess that's all now,
except that we miss you a lot, Davey.</i>

30
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:52,394
<i>Write soon.
Love, Uncle George and Aunt Grace.</i>

31
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,321
<i>The main bout brings together
two very game boys.</i>

32
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,625
<i>The youngster, undefeated
in 22 professional encounters...</i>

33
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,632
<i>Kid Rodriguez,
and the veteran Davey Gordon,</i>

34
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,225
<i>who has emerged victorious
in 88 fights,</i>

35
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,396
<i>while losing nine
and drawing two.</i>

36
00:11:13,505 --> 00:11:15,803
<i>Gordon's long career...
he is now 29...</i>

37
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:20,072
<i>has been one long promise
without fulfillment, at least thus far.</i>

38
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,613
<i>As hard a puncher as they come,
a clever boxer,</i>

39
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,183
<i>he's been plagued by a weak chin</i>

40
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,878
<i>and the unlucky knack
of being at his worst for the big one.</i>

41
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,080
<i>And tonight is a big one indeed,</i>

42
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,488
<i>with a title bout in the offing
for the winner.</i>

43
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:37,028
<i>And now, let's take time out
for a friendly word from our sponsor.</i>

44
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,892
<i>How many times have you
come home in the evening</i>

45
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:39,965
<i>and wanted to feel the...</i>

46
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:13,217
One, two, three, four,

47
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:18,194
five, six, seven, eight.

48
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,144
One, two...

49
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,486
...four, five, six...

50
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:55,417
...eight...

51
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:07,091
Go on home, Gordon!
You're a bum!

52
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,360
Go on home, Gordon!

53
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:13,029
Why don't you give up?
You're all through!

54
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,698
<i>Tonight we may very well have seen
ring history in the making</i>

55
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:18,674
<i>in the form of a sensational
young welterweight Rodriguez</i>

56
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:22,372
<i>and his impressive K.O. over
the experienced campaigner Gordon.</i>

57
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,450
<i>But for Gordon, tonight must come
as a bitter pill indeed.</i>

58
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,848
<i>This was the fight for him
to prove his glass chin</i>

59
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,477
<i>had been remade into sterner stuff.</i>

60
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:33,752
<i>But unfortunately for him,
tonight again it was as fragile as ever.</i>

61
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:01,936
Hello?

62
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,607
<i>Mr. Davey Gordon, please.
Seattle is calling.</i>

63
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,115
That's me.

64
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:09,051
<i>Just a moment.
Your party's on the line.</i>

65
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,956
<i>- Hi, Davey. This is Uncle George.
- Hey, Uncle George.</i>

66
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:14,753
<i>- How are you?
- Fine. How are you?</i>

67
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,452
<i>We're all fine, too.</i>

68
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:19,359
<i>Say, how would you like
to take a vacation out here,</i>

69
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:21,227
<i>come spend a little time with us?</i>

70
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,733
<i>Country's mighty nice
this time of the year.</i>

71
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:26,463
It's really nice of you
to ask me out, but...

72
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:29,665
<i>- We saw the fight on TV tonight.
- So?</i>

73
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,767
<i>- Nothing. We just saw it.
- It must have looked great.</i>

74
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,608
<i>- These things happen sometimes.
- I don't know what happened.</i>

75
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,511
<i>- I had him going.
- Forget it, forget it.</i>

76
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,779
<i>You need a vacation,
and we haven't seen you for two years.</i>

77
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,616
<i>Why don't you make a reservation
and come on out?</i>

78
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,919
Look, I don't know.

79
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:50,256
Say, look,
I feel a little dopey right now, George,

80
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,796
but let me think about it.

81
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,458
I'll... I'll call you.

82
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:59,503
<i>- Wait. You're not hurt, are you?
- No, no. I'm just tired, that's all.</i>

83
00:18:59,704 --> 00:19:02,229
<i>Good. Then you'll let us know
just as soon as you can.</i>

84
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,364
Sure.

85
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,307
<i>- Your aunt Grace sends her love.
- Tell her the same from here.</i>

86
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:11,439
<i>Okay. As it stands now,
you'll let us know when to expect you.</i>

87
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,418
I certainly will, and thanks for calling.
It was nice hearing from you.

88
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,545
<i>- Take care of yourself.
- And you, too.</i>

89
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,681
<i>- Good night.
- Good night, Davey boy.</i>

90
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:23,176
<i>Go on home, Gordon!
You're a bum!</i>

91
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,051
<i>Go on home, Gordon!</i>

92
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,753
<i>Why don't you give up?
You're all through!</i>

93
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,599
Hey, what's going on in there?

94
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,323
There you go.
That's better.

95
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,768
Look...

96
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,068
...if you don't mind me...

97
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:50,733
if you don't mind me asking you,
what happened?

98
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:56,045
Well, about an hour ago...

99
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,324
Well?

100
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,535
What do you want?

101
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:23,905
I'm sorry.

102
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,140
I really am sorry.

103
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,008
It really doesn't matter now, does it?

104
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,173
I said I'm sorry.
Can't you forgive me?

105
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,250
No.

106
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,183
Please. Gloria, please.

107
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:38,085
Go away. Get out.

108
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,552
That figures to be.

109
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:49,896
All my life I've always spoiled
the things that meant the most to me.

110
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,366
All my life.

111
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:53,869
I really don't care.
I just want you to get out of here.

112
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,065
Gloria, please,
can't you understand?

113
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:59,143
lf... if only you could know
how low and worthless I feel.

114
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:01,337
I didn't even know
you had any feelings.

115
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:02,811
You foolish girl.

116
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,109
I'm... I'm mad about you.

117
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,741
I want to get you out of here.
I'll set you up right.

118
00:23:07,852 --> 00:23:09,649
- I'll be your slave forever.
- Nothing, nothing.

119
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:12,484
- You couldn't do anything for me.
- Please. All right, don't forgive me.

120
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,525
Just tolerate me
and let me suffer knowing how you feel.

121
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,185
Can't you get it, Vinnie?

122
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:21,061
To me you're just an old man,
and you smell bad.

123
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,929
I'm mad about you.

124
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,594
I can't stand it when I see
those guys dancing with you.

125
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,535
Every time I see it, my insides burn.

126
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,300
You won't have to see it anymore.

127
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:32,376
Please.
Please, just another chance.

128
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,911
- No. No chance, no nothing.
- Please.

129
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,072
Let go of me or I'll scream.

130
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,423
Don't think about it anymore.

131
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:51,495
He won't come back.
Don't worry.

132
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,200
I'm so tired now.

133
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,201
Just close your eyes.

134
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,294
Don't worry about anything.

135
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,466
I'll sit here with you for a while.

136
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,828
<i>I locked her door and went home.</i>

137
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:44,595
<i>But first thing in the morning,
I went back across to see how she was.</i>

138
00:26:44,702 --> 00:26:45,828
<i>My knocking woke her up,</i>

139
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,498
<i>but she was all smiles and yawns
and invited me in for breakfast.</i>

140
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:52,269
<i>Later over coffee,
she told me she had seen the fight,</i>

141
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,141
<i>and I suppose that got me started
talking about myself,</i>

142
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:56,975
<i>about what a wash-up I was,</i>

143
00:26:57,081 --> 00:27:00,539
<i>how I was going back to Seattle
and work on my uncle's horse ranch.</i>

144
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:05,316
<i>But when I think back about it now,
I realize that all the time I was talking,</i>

145
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:08,483
<i>the thing that was really in my mind
was to remember not to ask</i>

146
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:11,687
<i>what it was her boss, Rappalo,
was so sorry for.</i>

147
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,560
Anyway, let's talk about you.

148
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,099
Like...

149
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,066
Who are those people
in that picture over there?

150
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,935
And how'd you ever get messed up
with that dance hall guy?

151
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:24,868
What's the matter?

152
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,107
Nothing.

153
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:30,806
Just that it's so funny
that you should ask

154
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,907
those questions that way,
together that way.

155
00:27:34,018 --> 00:27:35,315
Why?

156
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,947
Well, they have both so much
to do with each other.

157
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,046
How do you mean?

158
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,484
It's sort of an involved story.
Do you really want to hear it?

159
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,790
If you don't mind telling me,
I would, very much.

160
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,057
I don't mind.

161
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,258
For some reason, I feel like telling you.

162
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,392
I've never told anybody before.

163
00:27:57,041 --> 00:28:01,068
This is my father,
and this is my sister Iris.

164
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,615
But I suppose it's really Iris' story.

165
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:08,880
<i>She was a ballet dancer,
and everyone said she was very good.</i>

166
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:12,753
<i>She adored Daddy,
and of course, she was his favorite.</i>

167
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,957
<i>But let me start
from the beginning.</i>

168
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,358
<i>Iris was eight years old.</i>

169
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,694
<i>Father was a writer
with a growing reputation,</i>

170
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:24,893
<i>and Mother was very beautiful
and very intelligent.</i>

171
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:28,302
<i>They loved each other very much,
and they were very happy.</i>

172
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:32,773
<i>Then I was born,
and my mother died on the same day.</i>

173
00:28:33,544 --> 00:28:37,310
<i>They say Father went on a two-week
drunk to celebrate the double event.</i>

174
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:40,976
<i>And after that, I don't think
he ever thought of another woman.</i>

175
00:28:42,286 --> 00:28:45,687
<i>Time passed, and Iris grew
more beautiful each day.</i>

176
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,291
<i>She was the image of her mother.</i>

177
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,361
<i>Everyone said so.</i>

178
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:54,522
<i>Iris was Daddy's favorite,
and I was very jealous.</i>

179
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,226
<i>And maybe I began to hate her.</i>

180
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:01,366
<i>Daddy was good to me
and maybe he loved me a little, too.</i>

181
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:04,999
<i>By the time she was 20,
she was dancing with the Ballet Russe,</i>

182
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:07,236
<i>and Daddy was so proud of her.</i>

183
00:29:07,945 --> 00:29:10,209
<i>And then I remember the day clearly.</i>

184
00:29:10,314 --> 00:29:14,273
<i>It was my 13th birthday,
Sunday afternoon.</i>

185
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:18,446
<i>Iris came home excited
and told us of her marriage proposal.</i>

186
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:23,357
<i>The man wasn't bad-looking...
in his early 30s and very rich.</i>

187
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,554
<i>Father knew him and liked him,</i>

188
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:29,258
<i>but he couldn't stop laughing
when Iris told how she said no</i>

189
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:32,097
<i>simply because the fella wanted her
to give up her dancing</i>

190
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,898
<i>and just be his wife.</i>

191
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:37,268
<i>She never said
if she loved him or not.</i>

192
00:29:38,142 --> 00:29:42,704
<i>Then a few months later,
Daddy took sick and didn't get better.</i>

193
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,473
<i>And it turned out
that he never would</i>

194
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:49,041
<i>and that he would need
constant medical care until the end.</i>

195
00:29:49,153 --> 00:29:51,883
<i>"Six months to two years," they said.</i>

196
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,483
<i>Iris' salary wasn't enough,</i>

197
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:59,688
<i>and in two months' time,
all our savings were gone.</i>

198
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:05,035
<i>I couldn't work.
I was only 13 and still in grade school.</i>

199
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,000
<i>The next thing I knew,
she married her rich suitor,</i>

200
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:13,510
<i>and we were all living in great style
on his estate in Long Island.</i>

201
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,171
<i>Daddy had the best care
money could buy,</i>

202
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,340
<i>and he seemed happy
despite everything.</i>

203
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,211
<i>Iris gave up her dancing
according to the marriage bargain</i>

204
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,518
<i>and did little else
but sit at Daddy's bedside.</i>

205
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:30,917
<i>Sick as he was, he always
laughed a lot when they were together.</i>

206
00:30:31,662 --> 00:30:34,460
<i>I guess I hated her
more than ever now.</i>

207
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:40,969
<i>A year passed like that.</i>

208
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:45,031
<i>Her husband was a sweet man, but
none of us paid much attention to him.</i>

209
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,712
<i>And by then, I'm sure he knew
she didn't love him,</i>

210
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:51,145
<i>but he never said anything.</i>

211
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,545
<i>Then one cold winter morning,</i>

212
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:57,178
<i>the maid woke us
and said that Daddy was dead.</i>

213
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,119
<i>Iris was like a stone.</i>

214
00:30:59,223 --> 00:31:01,350
<i>She didn't even blink.</i>

215
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:04,724
<i>I began to cry
and shout that I hated her...</i>

216
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,888
<i>that she had only pretended with Daddy</i>

217
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,193
<i>and that she didn't ever love him.</i>

218
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,925
<i>She didn't say a word.</i>

219
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:18,202
<i>In his room, she stood quietly over
his body for a long time and smiled.</i>

220
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:22,268
<i>Then she went upstairs to her room
and put on their favorite record.</i>

221
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,610
<i>It was from one of her ballets.</i>

222
00:31:24,715 --> 00:31:26,740
<i>She played it very loud.</i>

223
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,546
<i>A short time later,
her husband found her in bed</i>

224
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,054
<i>with the covers drawn
up to her neck.</i>

225
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:35,819
<i>She had cut her wrists,
and she was dead.</i>

226
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:38,987
<i>She left me a note.</i>

227
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:44,063
She said she loved me.

228
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:48,298
She was sorry for making
a mess of everything between us.

229
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:52,233
A few days later, I was in the city
attending to some legal things,

230
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:54,334
and I happened to pass
the dance hall.

231
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:58,279
The sign read, "Pleasureland...
dancing partners wanted."

232
00:31:58,382 --> 00:32:00,976
I don't know what possessed me.
I went up.

233
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,144
I actually took the job.

234
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,115
I don't understand any part of it.

235
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:10,991
Every night I worked
in that depraved place...

236
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,655
a human zoo...

237
00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:18,963
I kept thinking, "At least Iris
never had... had to dance like this."

238
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,496
And then I started to feel
less unhappy.

239
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,575
Come on.
Let's go out for a walk.

240
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,547
<i>She got dressed,
and we went out for a walk.</i>

241
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:35,176
<i>And I bought her an ice cream
and saw her laugh for the first time.</i>

242
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,847
<i>I suppose we must have walked for
hours, and slowly her mood changed,</i>

243
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:42,289
<i>and she became very happy
and optimistic about life in general.</i>

244
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:43,587
<i>But when I told her I was planning</i>

245
00:32:43,694 --> 00:32:45,992
<i>to take the train back to Seattle
the next day,</i>

246
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,327
<i>she got serious again
and very quiet.</i>

247
00:32:48,432 --> 00:32:51,026
<i>I didn't know it then,
but I was already in over my head,</i>

248
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,932
<i>and I couldn't have cared less.</i>

249
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:55,096
<i>We didn't get back until after lunch,</i>

250
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,470
<i>and then in her apartment...</i>

251
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,113
- Something's happened.
- I know.

252
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:13,452
- Do you know?
- Sure. You kissed me.

253
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,357
Is that all?

254
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,452
That's all I saw,
and I was watching all the time.

255
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,554
I love you.

256
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:51,025
Love me? That's funny.

257
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,291
Why is it so funny? Why?

258
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,995
It's a mistake
to confuse pity with love.

259
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:12,407
Look, Gloria...

260
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:21,616
<i>Looking back now, I really don't know
what her reasons were then,</i>

261
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,422
<i>but she agreed
to come out to Seattle with me.</i>

262
00:34:24,528 --> 00:34:27,588
<i>I should have had sense enough,
though, to know that it was no good,</i>

263
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,166
<i>and she was so scared,
she'd grab at anything.</i>

264
00:34:30,267 --> 00:34:34,135
<i>But I was kidding myself, and all I could
think of was how much I wanted her.</i>

265
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,569
<i>We made train reservations</i>

266
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:38,335
<i>and wired Uncle George
to brace himself for a niece.</i>

267
00:34:38,442 --> 00:34:41,275
<i>And then we began
to get our finances together.</i>

268
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,614
<i>- Yes.
- This is Louie out front.</i>

269
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:49,550
<i>Gloria Price just called and said
I should tell you she's coming in tonight</i>

270
00:34:49,653 --> 00:34:51,712
<i>to pick up her last week's salary.</i>

271
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,823
<i>You there, Mr. Rappalo?</i>

272
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,217
Thanks. Good-bye.

273
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,983
<i>- Hello, Albert.
- Hello there, Davey.</i>

274
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,416
<i>- How are you?
- Okay, thanks.</i>

275
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:58,682
<i>Listen, have you got enough money on
you to cash my check from yesterday?</i>

276
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,654
What's the rush?
Bank's open in the morning.

277
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:01,747
<i>I don't feel too good.</i>

278
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,919
<i>I think I'll go out to Seattle for a while
and take stock of things.</i>

279
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,394
<i>- I'll explain it...
- Wait, I'll see.</i>

280
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,362
<i>Thanks. I'd appreciate it.</i>

281
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:19,042
<i>- Okay, come on over.
- Say...</i>

282
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:22,544
How about... Pleasureland instead?

283
00:36:22,646 --> 00:36:25,137
You know, that dance hall
at 49th and Broadway.

284
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:27,274
Maybe around 8:00 tonight?

285
00:36:27,384 --> 00:36:29,750
I'll be there,
but it has to be 8:15 sharp.

286
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,652
I'm taking my wife to a show,
and I'll just about make it.

287
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:34,815
<i>All right. I'll see you there.
Take it easy.</i>

288
00:36:34,925 --> 00:36:35,949
Okay.

289
00:38:22,766 --> 00:38:25,792
- Still feel the same way?
- Yes.

290
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,900
I understand
you're going away someplace.

291
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,030
Yes.

292
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,835
- Where?
- That's my business.

293
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:34,706
- I came for my paycheck.
- Oh, sure.

294
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:38,077
- How much do I owe you?
- For a week.

295
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:41,276
- Can't you tell me where you're going?
- No.

296
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,615
- Will I ever see you again?
- I doubt it.

297
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,554
- I couldn't take that.
- You'll have to.

298
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:50,622
- That's not true.
- Why isn't it?

299
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,026
I could kill you right here and now.

300
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,462
I don't think you will.

301
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,591
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

302
00:38:57,701 --> 00:39:01,762
Look, Vinnie,
l... I really am in a hurry.

303
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:05,205
- For what?
- Somebody's waiting downstairs.

304
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,881
- You going away with him?
- I don't have to tell you anything.

305
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,955
All the same, you are,
though, aren't you?

306
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:20,353
You figure it out.

307
00:39:20,457 --> 00:39:22,516
- Then you are.
- No comment.

308
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:25,288
He's a bum. You'll spend
the rest of your life grubbing for him.

309
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,057
- Is that so?
- Sure.

310
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,894
Like the man said,
"Can happiness buy money?"

311
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,492
Well, you're a comedian, too.
See what I'm missing?

312
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:39,768
Get out.

313
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:44,042
I'm not asking for favors,
but you owe it to me.

314
00:39:45,749 --> 00:39:47,046
Get out!

315
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,468
Come on.
Give me back the scarf.

316
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:15,640
Come on.

317
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,304
Come on!

318
00:41:16,473 --> 00:41:18,771
Miss, the boss says he's sorry,

319
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:21,572
and if you go upstairs,
you can collect your money.

320
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,124
What do you guys want?

321
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:21,899
Who are you?

322
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:27,069
Here. You want my money?

323
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:28,303
Here, take it.

324
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,249
Where'd you go?

325
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:15,757
Some jerk grabbed my scarf.
Did you get the money?

326
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:18,225
First he said no,
then he gave me an extra hundred.

327
00:43:18,328 --> 00:43:20,819
He's weird.
Did you see Albert?

328
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,195
Somebody was here before.

329
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,560
I guess he got tired of waiting.
We'll call him when he gets home.

330
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,281
<i>We had some ham and eggs</i>

331
00:44:11,381 --> 00:44:13,747
<i>and took our time saying good-bye
to the bright lights.</i>

332
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:14,874
<i>Then we went home.</i>

333
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,182
<i>Downstairs in the courtyard,
I suggested we each go and get packed</i>

334
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:20,381
<i>and I'd come over when I was through.</i>

335
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,832
Open up in there!

336
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:17,974
Hey, you.
Open this door!

337
00:46:21,344 --> 00:46:22,971
Open the door!

338
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:29,808
Looks like he's gone.

339
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,888
- You know where?
- No, sir.

340
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:35,214
- Where's he from?
- I don't know.

341
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,922
- When did he leave?
- I don't know.

342
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:59,647
- How long's he lived here?
- About a year.

343
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,116
Give me a hand with this drawer.
It's jammed.

344
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:03,481
Yes, sir.

345
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:09,786
- Say, what kind of trouble is he in?
- Bad trouble.

346
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:12,191
They found his manager's body
about an hour ago

347
00:47:12,295 --> 00:47:13,557
with his head bashed in.

348
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:19,158
Okay, let's go.

349
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:00,461
Good morning, Mr. Rappalo.

350
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:03,061
Gee, I'm sorry I missed you
at the arena last week,

351
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:06,199
but, well, anyhow,
Mr. Albert told me to tell you...

352
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,413
That was my manager
you knocked off.

353
00:49:10,513 --> 00:49:12,003
I don't know
what you're talking about.

354
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,707
- Where is she?
- Who do you mean?

355
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,978
- The girl, where is she?
- I don't know.

356
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:17,747
You don't know?

357
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:20,621
I'm gonna count to three,

358
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:23,784
and if you still don't know,
I'm gonna blow your brains out.

359
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:25,555
One, two...

360
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,129
She's in a loft on 24th Street.

361
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,494
- How'd she get there?
- Boys were waiting at her apartment.

362
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,534
- Is she all right?
- Yeah, sure, she's all right.

363
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,967
I had to do it.

364
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:37,305
She saw the boys at the dance hall.

365
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:40,535
She was a witness.
I thought you were dead.

366
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,442
They grabbed her and made it look
like she packed up and left.

367
00:49:43,546 --> 00:49:45,104
l... I thought you were dead.

368
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,115
I didn't want murder.

369
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,777
It's all gone wrong.

370
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:50,182
Get goin'!

371
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:30,723
Get 'em up.

372
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,270
Is that you, Mr. Rappalo?

373
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,301
Yes, it's me, boys.

374
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:12,628
Up! Everybody up!

375
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,840
Against the wall
and lean on your hands.

376
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:27,009
Come on.

377
00:51:54,577 --> 00:51:56,772
- How are you, baby?
- I'm okay.

378
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,143
I can't get the rope.

379
00:52:01,217 --> 00:52:02,206
Be careful.

380
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:08,784
You.

381
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:10,154
Yeah, you.

382
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:12,393
Untie her.

383
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:14,121
Listen, Vinnie... don't kill me.

384
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:15,623
I don't want to die.

385
00:53:16,392 --> 00:53:19,691
I'll do anything you say.
Anything.

386
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,729
You love him though, don't you?

387
00:53:23,399 --> 00:53:25,196
I don't know.
I don't think so.

388
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:26,768
I've only known him two days.

389
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,428
Two days?

390
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:32,108
Please, Vinnie.
Please don't kill me.

391
00:53:32,775 --> 00:53:34,970
You said you were
mad about me, remember?

392
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:38,809
I'm just an old man,
and I smell bad, remember?

393
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,712
I didn't mean it.

394
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:43,247
You know I didn't mean it.

395
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,897
- We could go away.
- Sure.

396
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:07,476
Sure, I've got lots of money.

397
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:10,137
We could have
loads of fun someplace, sure.

398
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,737
London, Paris, Sicily.

399
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:14,578
I'll do anything you want.

400
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:19,053
Maybe we could get married,
settle down, have a couple of kids.

401
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:21,680
- Sure.
- Sure.

402
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:26,558
What do you take me for,
a 14-karat sucker?

403
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:29,291
You and lover boy
aren't gonna put me in the hot seat.

404
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:31,128
You liked me once, remember?

405
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:32,895
Remember how nice it was?

406
00:54:33,002 --> 00:54:35,527
It could be like that again, Vinnie.
It could be like that again.

407
00:54:35,638 --> 00:54:37,731
- You're forgetting about him?
- I don't care about him.

408
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,003
Baby, you coulda had anything once,
but, no, you were too good for me.

409
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:43,237
So you come up to my office,
and you get me mad.

410
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:45,211
So I send the boys down
to work over lover boy.

411
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:46,304
They grab the wrong guy.

412
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,748
He bangs his head too hard
on the sidewalk,

413
00:54:48,851 --> 00:54:50,341
so that makes me the sucker?

414
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:51,784
Not on your life, baby.

415
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:53,116
Not on your life!

416
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:04,431
Don't shoot. Come on.

417
00:55:11,507 --> 00:55:13,873
Stay with her.
Go ahead!

418
00:55:47,076 --> 00:55:48,441
He went down there.

419
00:55:50,913 --> 00:55:52,881
Be careful.
It's a dead-end alley.

420
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,506
He'll never get out.

421
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,000
Look out!

422
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,706
Get that down!
Come on, hurry!

423
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:50,152
- What's the matter?
- My leg.

424
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,689
- Come on!
- I can't.

425
00:59:51,587 --> 00:59:52,918
My gun!

426
00:59:54,156 --> 00:59:55,646
I gotta get out of here.

427
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:29,606
I don't see anything, do you, Joe?

428
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:35,081
Well, let's go up to the roof
and take a look anyway.

429
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:37,632
<i>When the cops came,
I took them back to free Gloria.</i>

430
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,765
<i>The guy on the roof
was picked up later.</i>

431
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:42,776
<i>On the ride to the police station,
Gloria didn't say very much.</i>

432
01:04:42,878 --> 01:04:45,108
<i>I guess she was trying
to work out in her own mind</i>

433
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,148
<i>why I ran and left her alone like that.</i>

434
01:04:47,249 --> 01:04:49,683
<i>I don't suppose she ever thought
about how I might've felt</i>

435
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:51,912
<i>listening to her talk
to Rappalo that way.</i>

436
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:54,751
<i>At the station house,
they separated us for questioning.</i>

437
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:57,883
<i>Five hours later, they chalked off
Rappalo with self-defense</i>

438
01:04:57,993 --> 01:05:00,894
<i>and then worked a confession
from the hoods on Albert's murder.</i>

439
01:05:00,996 --> 01:05:02,156
<i>I was free.</i>

440
01:05:02,264 --> 01:05:06,325
<i>On my way out, the desk sergeant said
Gloria had left an hour before.</i>

441
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:08,266
<i>There was no message for me,</i>

442
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:10,964
<i>and I haven't heard from her
or seen her since.</i>

443
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,735
<i>And now I don't suppose
I ever will again.</i>

444
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:16,607
<i>Anyway, I guess
the whole thing was pretty silly...</i>

445
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:19,408
<i>know a girl for two days
and fall in love.</i>

446
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:23,110
<i>So I cashed my check,
sent flowers to Albert's widow,</i>

447
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:25,710
<i>cleaned up, and here I am.</i>

448
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:31,519
<i>The Pathfinder to Chicago
and Seattle,</i>

449
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:34,255
<i>leaving at 2:00,</i>

450
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:38,390
<i>west gate, track 13.</i>

451
01:05:39,134 --> 01:05:43,093
<i>Passengers for Pittsburgh, Chicago,</i>

452
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:46,606
<i>St. Louis and Seattle.</i>

453
01:05:47,142 --> 01:05:53,741
<i>This train has reserved seats,
