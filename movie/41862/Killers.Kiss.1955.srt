<i>It's crazy how you</i>

19
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:59,454
<i>and not even be able</i>

20
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:01,998

00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:07,003
<i>You get so you're no good</i>

22
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:09,881
<i>Maybe it begins by</i>
<i>taking life too serious.</i>

23
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:14,552
<i>Anyway, I think that's the way</i>
<i>it began for me...</i>

24
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:18,473
<i>just before my fight with Rodriguez</i>
<i>three days ago.</i>

25
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:26,809
- Hello.
- Hello, Davey.

26
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:28,853
<i>Hey, what's keeping you?</i>
<i>You're a half an hour late already.</i>

27
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,938
- How are ya?
<i>- Okay, but it's gettin' late.</i>

28
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:32,982
<i>I hate to wait around like this.</i>
<i>It makes me nervous.</i>

29
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:36,527
You better hop a cab. I had some trouble
with the car, and it's still tied up at the shop.

30
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:38,529
I'll meet ya over at the arena.

31
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:40,907
<i>- Okay. See you.</i>
- Right. Bye.

32
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:57,752
- You're doing all right for yourself.
- What do you mean?

33
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,673
- Oh, he just lives in the building.
- Oh.

34
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:05,176
- He used to be a pretty good fighter.
- A fighter?

35
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,053
Sure.

36
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:11,891
He's fighting tonight, as a matter of fact.
We can watch him on the TV.

37
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,405
<i>Dear Davey...</i>

38
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:29,158
<i>we still haven't heard from you</i>
<i>yet this month...</i>

39
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,703
<i>and we wondered whether everything</i>
<i>was still all right with ya.</i>

40
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:35,831
<i>Out here everything's about the same.</i>

41
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:40,336
<i>I still get into Seattle every week,</i>
<i>and the ranch is prosperin' nicely.</i>

42
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:45,216
<i>Last week, I finally bought</i>
<i>Mr. Henderson's chestnut Arabian stallion.</i>

43
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,511
<i>Your Aunt Grace's</i>
<i>arthritis is much better.</i>

44
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:51,555
<i>She can even take short rides</i>
<i>on Jumper now and then.</i>

45
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:56,769
<i>Well, I guess that's all now</i>
<i>except that we miss ya a lot, Davey.</i>

46
00:07:56,852 --> 00:08:00,606
<i>Write soon.</i>
<i>Love, Uncle George and Aunt Grace.</i>

47
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:10,754
<i>... main bout</i>
<i>brings together two very game boys--</i>

48
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:14,884
<i>the youngster, undefeated in 22</i>
<i>professional encounters, Kid Rodriguez...</i>

49
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:18,888
<i>and the veteran, Davey Gordon,</i>
<i>who's emerged victorious in 88 fights--</i>

50
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:21,849
<i>Davey Gordon!</i>
<i>- while losing nine and drawing two.</i>

51
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,893
<i>- Gordon's long career-- he is now 29--</i>
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen--</i>

52
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,895
<i>has been one long promise</i>
<i>without fulfillment...</i>

53
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:28,480
<i>- your attention, please!</i>
<i>- at least thus far.</i>

54
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,816
<i>As hard a puncher as they come--</i>
<i>a clever boxer--</i>

55
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,611
- <i>- he's been plagued by a weak chin...</i>

56
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:36,322
<i>and the unlucky knack</i>
<i>of being at his worst for the big ones.</i>

57
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:38,574
<i>And tonight is a big one indeed...</i>

58
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:41,994
<i>with a title bout in the offing</i>
<i>for the winner.</i>

59
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:45,414
<i>And now, let's take time out</i>
<i>for a friendly word from our sponsor.</i>

60
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:48,292
<i>How many times have you come home</i>
<i>in the evening and wanted to feel the--</i>

61
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:20,884
One, two, three...

62
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:24,555
four, five, six...

63
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,598
seven, eight!

64
00:14:55,687 --> 00:15:00,692
One, two, three, four, five...

65
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:03,153
six--

66
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:04,738
eight.

67
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:59,418
Hey, buddy!

68
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:15,559
Go on home, Gordon! You're a bum!

69
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,061
Go on home, Gordon!

70
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:21,440
Why don't you get lost!
You're all through!

71
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:24,484
<i>Tonight we may very well</i>
<i>have seen ring history in the making...</i>

72
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:27,237
<i>in the form of the sensational</i>
<i>young welterweight Rodriguez...</i>

73
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:31,074
<i>and his impressive K.O.</i>
<i>over the experienced campaigner Gordon.</i>

74
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:34,203
<i>But for Gordon, tonight must</i>
<i>come as a bitter pill indeed.</i>

75
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:38,040
<i>This was the fight for him to prove his glass</i>
<i>chin had been remade into sterner stuff.</i>

76
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:42,377
<i>But, unfortunately for him,</i>
<i>tonight again it was as fragile as ever.</i>

77
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:46,340
<i>It's a well-known ring adage that too</i>
<i>much education spoils a fighter...</i>

78
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:49,468
<i>and though there are</i>
<i>a few notable exceptions, Gordon--</i>

79
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,549
Hello?

80
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:13,176
<i>Mr. Davey Gordon, please.</i>
<i>Seattle's calling.</i>

81
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,761
That's me.

82
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:17,097
<i>Just a moment.</i>
<i>Your party's on the line.</i>

83
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:21,268
<i>- Hi, Davey. This is Uncle George.</i>
- Hey, Uncle George.

84
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,228
<i>- How are ya?</i>
- Fine. How are you?

85
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:24,980
<i>We're all fine too.</i>

86
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,983
<i>Say, how would you like</i>
<i>to take a vacation out here...</i>

87
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,985
<i>come spend a little time with us?</i>

88
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,321
<i>The country's mighty nice</i>
<i>this time of the year.</i>

89
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:34,865
Ah, it's really nice of ya
to ask me out, but, uh--

90
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,451
<i>Look, Dave,</i>
<i>we saw the fight on TV tonight.</i>

91
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:40,412
- So?
<i>- Well, nothin'. We just saw it.</i>

92
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,956
- It must've looked great.
<i>- Well, these things happen sometimes.</i>

93
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,000
I don't know what happened, George.
I had him goin'.

94
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:49,338
<i>Forget it. Forget it. You need a vacation,</i>
<i>and we haven't seen ya for two years.</i>

95
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:52,007
<i>Why don't you make a reservation</i>
<i>and come on out?</i>

96
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,844
Well, look, uh, I don't know. Uh--

97
00:18:55,927 --> 00:19:01,266
Say, look, I feel a little dopey right now,
George, but, uh, let me think about it.

98
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,935
I'll, uh-- I'll call you, all right?

99
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,937
<i>Wait. You're not hurt, are you, Dave?</i>

100
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:07,939
No, no. I'm just tired.
That's all.

101
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:10,442
<i>Good. Then you'll let us know</i>
<i>just as soon as you can?</i>

102
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:12,110
Sure.

103
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:15,906
<i>- Oh. Your Aunt Grace sends her love.</i>
- Oh, tell her the same from here, hmm?

104
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:19,951
<i>Okay. As it stands now,</i>
<i>you let us know when to expect you.</i>

105
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,621
I certainly will, Uncle George.
And thanks for calling.

106
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,040
- It was nice hearing from you.
<i>- Take care of yourself.</i>

107
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,959
- And you too. Good night.
<i>- Good night, Davey.</i>

108
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:31,440
<i>Go on home! You're a bum!</i>

109
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:33,775
<i>Go on home, Gordon!</i>

110
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:37,112
<i>- Why don't you give up! You're all through!</i>

111
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:50,333
Hey! What's goin' on in there?

112
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:50,644
There you go. That's better.

113
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:54,189
Look...

114
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:58,026
if you don't mind me, uh--
if you don't mind me asking you...

115
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:00,111
what happened?

116
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:04,407
Well, about an hour ago--

117
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:26,137
Well?

118
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:29,599
What do you want?

119
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,811
I'm sorry.

120
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,855
I really am sorry.

121
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:39,693
- It really doesn't matter now, does it?
- I said I'm sorry. Can't you forgive me?

122
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:43,572
- No.
- Please. Gloria, please.

123
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:46,491
Go away. Get out.

124
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,999
Ah, it figures to be.

125
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:58,253
All my life I've always spoiled
the things that meant the most to me.

126
00:22:58,336 --> 00:22:59,963
All my life.

127
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,299
I really don't care.
I just want you to get out of here.

128
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,426
Gloria, please, can't you understand?

129
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:07,804
If-- If only you could know
how low and worthless I feel.

130
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,433
- I didn't even know you had any feelings.
- Oh, you foolish girl.

131
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:15,604
I'm-- I'm mad about you. I want to
get you outta here. I'll set you up right.

132
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:18,106
- I'll be your slave for the rest of my life.
- Nothing. Nothing!

133
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,692
- You couldn't do anything for me.
- Please. All right. Don't forgive me.

134
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:23,778
Just tolerate me and let me suffer
knowing how you feel.

135
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:25,780
Can't you get it, Vinnie?

136
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:29,492
To me, you're just an old man,
and you smell bad.

137
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:32,037
I'm mad about you.

138
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,122
I can't stand when I see
those guys dancing with you.

139
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:37,667
- Every time I see it, my insides burn.
- Well, you won't have to see it anymore.

140
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:40,754
Please. Please, just another chance.

141
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:43,465
- No. No chance. No nothing.
- Just another chance. Please.

142
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:47,886
Let go of me, or I'll scream!

143
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,187
Don't think about it anymore.

144
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,106
Oh, he won't come back.
Don't worry.

145
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,736
I'm so tired now.

146
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:06,988
Just close your eyes.

147
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:09,658
Don't worry about anything.

148
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:11,993
I'll sit here with you for a while.

149
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:49,192
<i>I locked her door and went home.</i>

150
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:52,779
<i>But first thing in the morning,</i>
<i>I went back across to see how she was.</i>

151
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:55,698
<i>My knockin' woke her up,</i>
<i>but she was all smiles and yawns...</i>

152
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,784
<i>- and invited me in for breakfast.</i>

153
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:00,495
<i>Later, over coffee,</i>
<i>she told me she had seen the fight...</i>

154
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:03,206
<i>and I suppose that got me</i>
<i>started talking about myself...</i>

155
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:06,501
<i>about what a wash up I was</i>
<i>and how I was going back to Seattle...</i>

156
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,628
<i>and work on my uncle's horse ranch.</i>

157
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:10,922
<i>But when I think back about it now...</i>

158
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:13,466
<i>I realize that all the</i>
<i>time I was talkin'...</i>

159
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,469
<i>the thing that was really in my mind</i>
<i>was to remember not to ask...</i>

160
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:19,597
<i>what it was her boss, Rapallo,</i>
<i>was so sorry for.</i>

161
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,809
Anyway, let's talk about you.

162
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,561
Like--

163
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,939
Who are those people
in that picture over there?

164
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:30,817
And how'd you ever get messed up
with that dance hall guy?

165
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:35,446
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

166
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,240
It's just that...

167
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:40,368
it's so funny that you should
ask those questions that way--

168
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:42,120
together that way.

169
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,872
Why?

170
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:47,166
Well, they have both so much
to do with each other.

171
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,002
How do you mean?

172
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:51,379
It's a sort of an involved story.
Do you really wanna hear it?

173
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,798
If you don't mind telling me,
I would very much.

174
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:57,218
I don't mind. For some reason,
I feel like telling you.

175
00:27:57,302 --> 00:28:00,179
I've never told anybody before.

176
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:07,020
This is my father...

177
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:09,606
and this is my sister, Iris.

178
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:12,734
But I suppose it's really Iris's story.

179
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:17,280
<i>She was a ballet dancer,</i>
<i>and everyone said she was very good.</i>

180
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:21,409
<i>She adored Daddy,</i>
<i>and, of course, she was his favorite.</i>

181
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:24,162
<i>But let me start from the beginning.</i>

182
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:26,497
<i>Iris was eight years old.</i>

183
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:29,584
<i>Father was a writer</i>
<i>with a growing reputation...</i>

184
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:33,129
<i>and Mother was very beautiful</i>
<i>and very intelligent.</i>

185
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,215
<i>They loved each other much</i>
<i>and they were very happy.</i>

186
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:40,345
<i>Then I was born,</i>
<i>and my mother died on the same day.</i>

187
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:45,391
<i>They say Father went on a two-week drunk</i>
<i>to celebrate the double event...</i>

188
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:48,603
<i>and after that, I don't think</i>
<i>he ever thought of another woman.</i>

189
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:53,566
<i>Time passed,</i>
<i>and Iris grew more beautiful each day.</i>

190
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:58,613
<i>She was the image of her mother.</i>
<i>Everyone said so.</i>

191
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:02,659
<i>Iris was Daddy's favorite,</i>
<i>and I was very jealous...</i>

192
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:06,120
<i>and maybe I began to hate her.</i>

193
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:09,457
<i>Daddy was good to me,</i>
<i>and maybe he loved me a little too.</i>

194
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,919
<i>By the time she was 20, she was</i>
<i>dancing with the Ballets Russes...</i>

195
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:15,004
<i>and Daddy was so proud of her.</i>

196
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:18,424
<i>And then I remember the day clearly.</i>

197
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:22,512
<i>It was my 13th birthday,</i>
<i>Sunday afternoon.</i>

198
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:26,641
<i>Iris came home excited</i>
<i>and told us of her marriage proposal.</i>

199
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:31,521
<i>The man wasn't bad-looking,</i>
<i>in his early 30s and very rich.</i>

200
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:33,606
<i>Father knew him and liked him...</i>

201
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:37,527
<i>but he couldn't stop laughing</i>
<i>when Iris told how she said no...</i>

202
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:41,614
<i>simply because the fella wanted her to
give up her dancing and just be his wife.</i>

203
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,826
<i>She never said if she loved him or not.</i>

204
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:50,415
<i>Then a few months later,</i>
<i>Daddy took sick and didn't get better.</i>

205
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,876
<i>And it turned out that he never would...</i>

206
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,088
<i>and that he would need</i>
<i>constant medical care until the end.</i>

207
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,841
<i>"Six months to two years," they said.</i>

208
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,387
<i>Iris's salary wasn't enough...</i>

209
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,391
<i>and in two months' time,</i>
<i>all our savings were gone.</i>

210
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:12,979
<i>I couldn't work.</i>
<i>I was only 13 and still in grade school.</i>

211
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:17,108
<i>The next thing I knew,</i>
<i>she married her rich suitor...</i>

212
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:21,112
<i>and we were all living in great style</i>
<i>on his estate in Long Island.</i>

213
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:24,365
<i>Daddy had the best
care money could buy...</i>

214
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:27,952
<i>and he seemed happy, despite everything.</i>

215
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:31,122
<i>Iris gave up her dancing,</i>
<i>according to the marriage bargain...</i>

216
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:34,250
<i>and did little else</i>
<i>but sit at Daddy's bedside.</i>

217
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:38,713
<i>Sick as he was, he always laughed a lot</i>
<i>when they were together.</i>

218
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,258
<i>I guess I hated her more than ever now.</i>

219
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,057
<i>A year passed like that.</i>

220
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,935
<i>Her husband was a sweet man,</i>
<i>but none of us paid much attention to him.</i>

221
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:56,981
<i>And by then</i>
<i>I'm sure he knew she didn't love him...</i>

222
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:59,901
<i>but he never said anything.</i>

223
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:01,652
<i>And then one cold winter morning...</i>

224
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:05,073
<i>the maid woke us</i>
<i>and said that Daddy was dead.</i>

225
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:07,033
<i>Iris was like a stone.</i>

226
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:09,494
<i>She didn't even blink.</i>

227
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:12,914
<i>I began to cry</i>
<i>and shout that I hated her...</i>

228
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:17,043
<i>that she'd only pretended with Daddy</i>
<i>and that she didn't ever love him.</i>

229
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:20,463
<i>She didn't say a word.</i>

230
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:24,300
<i>In his room, she stood quietly</i>
<i>over his body for a long time...</i>

231
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,135
<i>and smiled.</i>

232
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:30,431
<i>Then she went upstairs to her room</i>
<i>and put on their favorite record...</i>

233
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:32,850
<i>that was from one of her ballets.</i>

234
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:35,394
<i>She played it very loud.</i>

235
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:39,524
<i>A short time later, her husband found her</i>
<i>in bed with the covers drawn up to her neck.</i>

236
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:43,694
<i>She'd cut her wrists, and she was dead.</i>

237
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:46,948
<i>She left me a note.</i>

238
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:51,994
She said she loved me.

239
00:31:52,787 --> 00:31:56,207
She was sorry for making a mess
of everything between us.

240
00:31:57,375 --> 00:32:00,253
A few days later I was in the city
attending to some legal things...

241
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:02,839
and I happened to pass the dance hall.

242
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:06,175
The sign read: "Pleasureland.
Dancing partners wanted."

243
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:10,763
I don't know what possessed me.
I went up. I actually took the job.

244
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:15,393
I don't understand any part of it.

245
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:18,855
Every night
I-I worked in that depraved place--

246
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:21,774
a human zoo.

247
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:25,027
I kept thinking,
"At least Iris never had--

248
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,405
had to dance like this."

249
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:31,409
And then I started to feel less unhappy.

250
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:37,081
Come on. Let's go out for a walk.

251
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:39,792
<i>She got dressed</i>
<i>and we went out for a walk...</i>

252
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:43,588
<i>and I bought her an ice cream</i>
<i>and saw her laugh for the first time.</i>

253
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:46,757
<i>I suppose we must've walked for hours,</i>
<i>and slowly her mood changed...</i>

254
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:50,386
<i>and she became very happy</i>
<i>and optimistic about life in general.</i>

255
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:54,098
<i>But when I told her I was planning to take</i>
<i>the train back to Seattle the next day...</i>

256
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:56,726
<i>- she got serious again and very quiet.</i>

257
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:01,189
<i>I didn't know it then, but I was already in</i>
<i>over my head and I couldn't have cared less.</i>

258
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:05,109
<i>We didn't get back until after lunch,</i>
<i>and then in her apartment--</i>

259
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:15,703
Something's happened.

260
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:18,039
I know.

261
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:19,624
Do you know?

262
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:21,626
Sure. You kissed me.

263
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:24,545
Is that all?

264
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:27,632
That's all I saw,
and I was watching all the time.

265
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:56,619
I love you.

266
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:59,372
Love me? That's funny.

267
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:04,794
Why is it so funny? Why?

268
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:07,713
It's a mistake to
confuse pity with love.

269
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:20,309
I love you, Gloria.

270
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,777
<i>Lookin' back now, I really</i>
<i>don't know what her reasons were then...</i>

271
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,780
<i>but she agreed</i>
<i>to come out to Seattle with me.</i>

272
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:35,616
<i>I should've had sense enough, though,</i>
<i>to know that it was no good...</i>

273
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,286
<i>and that she was so scared</i>
<i>she'd grab at anything.</i>

274
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:42,456
<i>But I was kiddin' myself, and all I could</i>
<i>think of was how much I wanted her.</i>

275
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:46,460
<i>We made train reservations and wired</i>
<i>Uncle George to brace himself for a niece...</i>

276
00:34:46,544 --> 00:34:49,130
<i>and then we began to get</i>
<i>our finances together.</i>

277
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,760
- Yes?
<i>- This is Louie out front.</i>

278
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:57,722
<i>Gloria Price just called and said</i>
<i>I should tell you she's coming in tonight...</i>

279
00:34:57,805 --> 00:35:00,349
<i>to pick up her last week's salary.</i>

280
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:02,476
<i>You there, Mr. Rapallo?</i>

281
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:05,479
Thanks. Good-bye.

282
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,370
<i>- Hello, Albert?</i>
- Hello there, Davey. How are ya?

283
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:04,372
<i>Okay. Thanks. Uh, listen, Albert.</i>

284
00:36:04,455 --> 00:36:06,749
<i>Have you got enough money on ya</i>
<i>to cash my check from yesterday?</i>

285
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,751
What's the rush?
Bank's open in the morning.

286
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,503
<i>I don't feel too good, Albert.</i>

287
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:12,880
<i>I think I'll go out to Seattle for a while</i>
<i>and, uh, take stock of things.</i>

288
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,882
<i>- I'll explain it.</i>
- Wait a minute. I'll see.

289
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:16,634
<i>Thanks. I'd appreciate it.</i>

290
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:26,394
Okay. Come on over.

291
00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:30,398
Say, uh, how 'bout,
uh, Pleasureland instead?

292
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:33,192
You know that dance hall
at 49th and Broadway?

293
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:35,194
Maybe around 8:00 tonight, huh?

294
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:37,905
I'll be there,
but it has to be 8:15 sharp.

295
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:40,908
I'm taking my wife to a show,
and I'll just about make it.

296
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:42,993
<i>Right. </i>
<i>I'll see you there. Take it easy.</i>

297
00:36:43,077 --> 00:36:44,745
Okay.

298
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:27,455
<i>BALLAD]</i>

299
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:33,687
- You still feel the same way?
- Yes.

300
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,857
I understand
you're going away someplace.

301
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:38,734
- Yes.
- Where?

302
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:41,070
That's my business.
I came for my paycheck.

303
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,072
Oh, sure.

304
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:46,033
- How much do I owe you?
- For a week.

305
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:49,203
- Can't you tell me where you're going?
- No.

306
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,705
- Will I ever see you again?
- I doubt it.

307
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:54,458
- I couldn't take that.
- You'll have to.

308
00:38:55,668 --> 00:38:58,671
- That's not true.
- Why isn't it?

309
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:01,173
I could kill you right here and now.

310
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:03,801
Oh, I don't think you will.

311
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:05,803
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

312
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:09,890
Look, Vinnie,
I-- I really am in a hurry.

313
00:39:09,974 --> 00:39:13,102
- For what?
- Somebody's waiting downstairs.

314
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:23,028
You going away with him?

315
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:25,239
I don't have to tell you anything.

316
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:28,409
- All the same, you are, though, aren't you?
- You figure it out.

317
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:30,619
- Then you are.
- No comment.

318
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:33,247
Look, he's a bum. You'll spend
the rest of your life grubbin' for him.

319
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,457
- Is that so?
- Sure.

320
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,751
Like the man said,
"Can happiness buy money?"

321
00:39:37,835 --> 00:39:41,380
Well, you're a comedian too.
See what I'm missing?

322
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:48,679
Get out.

323
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:51,765
I'm not asking for favors,
but you owe it to me.

324
00:39:53,684 --> 00:39:55,352
Get out!

325
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:15,998
Hey. Hey.

326
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:20,377
Come on. Give me back the scarf.

327
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:25,424
Come on. Come on. Hey!

328
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:29,345
Come-- Hey!

329
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:27,069
Miss, the boss says he's sorry...

330
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:29,822
and if you go upstairs,
you can collect your money.

331
00:42:21,874 --> 00:42:23,876
What do you guys want?

332
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:30,841
Who are ya?

333
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:36,305
Here. You want my money?
Here, take it.

334
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:22,518
- Where'd you go?
- Some jerk grabbed my scarf.

335
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:24,019
Did you get the money?

336
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,438
First he said no, then he gave me
an extra hundred.

337
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:28,816
He's weird.
Did ya-- Did ya see Albert?

338
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:31,109
I don't--
Somebody was here before.

339
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:09,356
I guess he got tired of waiting.
We'll call him when he gets home.

340
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,158
<i>We had some ham and eggs...</i>

341
00:44:20,242 --> 00:44:22,160
<i>and took our time saying good-bye</i>
<i>to the bright lights.</i>

342
00:44:22,244 --> 00:44:23,662
<i>Then we went home.</i>

343
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:26,665
<i>Downstairs in the courtyard, I suggested
that we each go and get packed...</i>

344
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:28,959
<i>and I'd come over when I was through.</i>

345
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:18,735
Open up in there!

346
00:46:24,116 --> 00:46:25,867
Hey, you! Open the door!

347
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:31,498
Open the door!

348
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,839
- Looks like he's gone.
- You know where?

349
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:40,799
No, sir.

350
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:43,343
- Where's he from?
- I don't know.

351
00:46:44,678 --> 00:46:47,347
- When did he leave?
- I don't know.

352
00:47:03,947 --> 00:47:08,035
- How long has he lived here?
- Oh, about a year.

353
00:47:08,118 --> 00:47:10,245
Give me a hand with this drawer.
It's jammed.

354
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,997
Yes, sir.

355
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:18,045
- Say, uh, what kind of trouble is he in?
- Bad trouble.

356
00:47:18,128 --> 00:47:21,465
They found his manager's body about
an hour ago with his head bashed in.

357
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:27,054
Okay, let's go.

358
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:08,697
Good morning, Mr. Rapallo.

359
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,491
Gee, I'm sorry I missed you
at the arena last week...

360
00:49:11,575 --> 00:49:15,287
but, uh, well, anyway,
Mr. Albert told me to tell you--

361
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:18,707
That was my manager you knocked off.

362
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:21,084
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Where is she?

363
00:49:21,168 --> 00:49:22,836
- Who do you mean?
- The girl! Where is she?

364
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:25,422
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

365
00:49:27,424 --> 00:49:29,843
I'm gonna count to three,
and if you still don't know...

366
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:31,845
I'm gonna blow your brains out!

367
00:49:31,928 --> 00:49:33,680
One, two--

368
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:36,183
- She's in a loft on 24th Street.
- How'd she get there?

369
00:49:36,266 --> 00:49:38,476
- Boys were waiting at her apartment.
- Is she all right?

370
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,520
Yeah. Sure, she's all right.

371
00:49:40,604 --> 00:49:42,772
I had to do it.

372
00:49:42,856 --> 00:49:45,567
She saw the boys at the dance hall.

373
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:48,486
She was a witness.
I thought you were dead.

374
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:51,364
They grabbed her and made it look like
she packed up and left.

375
00:49:51,448 --> 00:49:55,577
I-I thought you were dead.
I didn't want murder.

376
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,996
- It's all gone wrong.
- Get goin'.

377
00:50:37,494 --> 00:50:39,454
Get 'em up.

378
00:50:49,506 --> 00:50:52,008
Is that you, Mr. Rapallo?

379
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:55,220
Yes, it's me, boys.

380
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:21,621
Up! Everybody up!

381
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:27,252
Against the wall. Lean on your hands.

382
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:35,552
Come on.

383
00:52:02,746 --> 00:52:05,081
- How are ya, baby?
- I'm okay.

384
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:09,002
I can't get the rope.

385
00:52:09,085 --> 00:52:10,754
Be careful.

386
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:18,053
You. Yeah, you.

387
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:21,097
Untie her.

388
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,366
Listen, Vinnie.

389
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:24,577
Don't kill me. I don't wanna die.

390
00:53:24,661 --> 00:53:27,664
I'll do anything you say. Anything.

391
00:53:28,998 --> 00:53:31,459
You love him though, don't ya?

392
00:53:31,543 --> 00:53:34,754
I don't know. I don't think so.
I've only known him two days.

393
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:37,215
Two days.

394
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:39,884
Please, Vinnie. Please don't kill me.

395
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:43,263
You said you were mad about me.
Remember?

396
00:53:43,346 --> 00:53:46,808
I'm just an old man, and I smell bad.
Remember?

397
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:49,477
I didn't mean it.

398
00:53:49,561 --> 00:53:51,563
You know I didn't mean it.

399
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:13,960
- We could go away.
- Sure.

400
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:18,173
Sure. I got lots of money. We could
have loads of fun someplace. Sure.

401
00:54:18,256 --> 00:54:20,842
London. Paris. Sicily.

402
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,677
I'll do anything you want.

403
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,555
Maybe we could get married,
settle down...

404
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:27,432
have a couple of kids.

405
00:54:27,515 --> 00:54:29,559
- Sure.
- Sure.

406
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:34,564
What do you take me for,
a 14-carat sucker?

407
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:37,317
You and lover boy
aren't gonna put me in the hot seat.

408
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,237
Vinnie, you liked me once. Remember?
You remember how nice it was?

409
00:54:41,321 --> 00:54:43,865
It could be like that again, Vinnie.
It could be like that again.

410
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:45,742
- You forgettin' about him?
- I don't care about him.

411
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:49,204
Look, baby. You could've had anything once,
but no, you were too good for me.

412
00:54:49,287 --> 00:54:51,664
So you come up to my office,
and you get me mad.

413
00:54:51,748 --> 00:54:53,666
So I send the boys down
to work over lover boy.

414
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:56,878
So they grab the wrong guy. So he bangs
his head too hard on the sidewalk.

415
00:54:56,961 --> 00:55:00,381
So that makes me the sucker, huh?
Not on your life, baby. Not on your life.

416
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:05,303
Hey!

417
00:55:11,434 --> 00:55:13,811
Don't shoot. Come on!

418
00:55:19,651 --> 00:55:21,986
Stay with her. Go ahead!

419
00:55:54,978 --> 00:55:57,230
He went down there!

420
00:55:59,274 --> 00:56:02,443
Be careful. It's a dead-end alley.
He'll never get out.

421
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:02,503
Look out!

422
00:57:06,883 --> 00:57:09,218
Get that down. Come on. Hurry!

423
00:58:54,574 --> 00:58:56,701
Oh! Oh!

424
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:58,995
- What's the matter?
- My leg. Oh!

425
00:58:59,078 --> 00:59:01,080
- Come on!
- I can't!

426
01:00:00,056 --> 01:00:02,308
I got 'im.

427
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:04,227
I gotta get outta here.

428
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:40,132
- I don't see anything. Do you, Joe?
<i>- Car 14. Car 14.</i>

429
01:02:40,216 --> 01:02:43,052
Well, let's go up to the roof
and take a look anyway.

430
01:04:42,963 --> 01:04:45,674
<i>When the cops came,</i>
<i>I took them back to free Gloria.</i>

431
01:04:45,758 --> 01:04:47,802
<i>- The guy on the roof was picked up later.</i>

432
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:50,805
<i>On the ride to the police station,</i>
<i>Gloria didn't say very much.</i>

433
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:55,476
<i>I guess she was trying to work out in her own</i>
<i>mind why I ran and left her alone like that.</i>

434
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:57,937
<i>I don't suppose she ever thought</i>
<i>about how I might have felt...</i>

435
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:00,272
<i>listening to her talk</i>
<i>to Rapallo that way.</i>

436
01:05:00,356 --> 01:05:02,942
<i>At the station house,</i>
<i>they separated us for questioning.</i>

437
01:05:03,025 --> 01:05:05,986
<i>Five hours later, they chalked</i>
<i>off Rapallo as self-defense...</i>

438
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:08,948
<i>and had worked a confession</i>
<i>from the hoods in Albert's murder.</i>

439
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:10,699
<i>- I was free.</i>

440
01:05:10,783 --> 01:05:14,620
<i>On my way out, the desk sergeant</i>
<i>said Gloria had left an hour before.</i>

441
01:05:14,703 --> 01:05:19,250
<i>There was no message for me, and I</i>
<i>haven't heard from her or seen her since.</i>

442
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:22,128
<i>And now I don't suppose</i>
<i>I ever will again.</i>

443
01:05:22,211 --> 01:05:24,672
<i>Well, anyway, I guess the</i>
<i>whole thing was pretty silly.</i>
