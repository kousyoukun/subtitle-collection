1
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,167
I got eyes on the animal.

2
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,994
What?

3
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,913
Let me out!

4
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,048
Keep it steady!

5
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,355
Damn, I don't see it. Do you see it?

6
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,067
Settle down, kid. She can't run forever.

7
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:37,213
<i>Dinosaurs are in our world.</i>

8
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:41,050
<i>And with every confrontation, we learn
more about this frightening new reality.</i>

9
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,346
<i>How did we get here?</i>

10
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,055
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

11
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,643
<i>It's been three decades
since the deadly events at Jurassic Park,</i>

12
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,896
<i>and we've yet to find a way
for these animals to live safely among us.</i>

13
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,442
<i>After the devastating eruption
of Isla Nublar's long-dormant volcano,</i>

14
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:01,737
<i>those who survived were transported
to the mainland.</i>

15
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,697
Many of the larger predators
were captured,

16
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,867
but the remaining creatures
scattered here,

17
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:09,536
<i>in Big Rock National Park.</i>

18
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,165
<i>While most remained in the wild,
those who made their way to civilization</i>

19
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:15,793
<i>struggled to adapt
to unfamiliar conditions.</i>

20
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:19,797
<i>Local authorities have warned
the animals are unpredictable,</i>

21
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,716
<i>and when hungry, extremely violent.</i>

22
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,720
<i>As the dinosaurs spread across borders,
a global black market has risen.</i>

23
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,848
- They're not ours.
- Go on, you sad, pathetic loser!

24
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,978
<i>To combat the growing threat
of illegal poachers,</i>

25
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,021
<i>the US Congress awarded
sole collection rights</i>

26
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:39,274
<i>to the global giant Biosyn Genetics.</i>

27
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,985
At Biosyn, we're dedicated to the idea

28
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:46,115
that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves.

29
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:51,786
<i>CEO Lewis Dodgson has created
a sanctuary in Italy's Dolomite Mountains,</i>

30
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,706
<i>where he hopes to study
the dinosaurs' ancient immune systems</i>

31
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,917
<i>for unique pharmaceutical properties.</i>

32
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,545
<i>While Biosyn believes
we can handle genetic power responsibly,</i>

33
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,338
<i>the public remains skeptical.</i>

34
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:08,512
Some note these government contracts have
led to massive spikes in Biosyn's profits.

35
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:13,225
And rumors persist of a human clone
who mysteriously disappeared,

36
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:14,810
leading to a worldwide search.

37
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:18,396
<i>Some believe she's genetically identical
to Charlotte Lockwood,</i>

38
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,151
<i>deceased daughter of Jurassic Park
co-founder, Benjamin Lockwood.</i>

39
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,528
<i>Now that we brought these animals
back from extinction,</i>

40
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,406
<i>can we face the consequences?</i>

41
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,574
<i>Are we responsible for them,</i>

42
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,161
<i>or should they be left
to fend for themselves?</i>

43
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,538
<i>As we adapt to an ever-changing world,</i>

44
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,000
<i>we must find answers to these questions,</i>

45
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,502
<i>for their safely as well as for our own.</i>

46
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,718
Let it go!

47
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,262
Hold on!

48
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:30,052
We are inside
the illegal breeding facility.

49
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,139
The juveniles are kept in cages
to keep costs down.

50
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,475
It's medieval.

51
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,645
Claire.

52
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,236
Why do you think he's separated
from the rest?

53
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:52,408
I don't think he's gonna make it.

54
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,624
No. What are you doing?
We could report this.

55
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,210
The DFW takes days to investigate.

56
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:05,712
We can save this one now.

57
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,256
It's okay. It's okay, buddy.

58
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:12,885
Okay. Here we go.

59
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,768
Nope. No!

60
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,937
- Lift.
- Okay.

61
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,938
- Support the head.
- Yeah.

62
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,691
Okay. Yeah.

63
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,668
- Hurry up!
- Check the right side.

64
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,528
- With me.
- Go, go, go.

65
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,113
Okay, come on.
Come on, let's go.

66
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,162
- Hold on!
- To what?

67
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,679
Shit.

68
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,145
Claire, we're gonna get shot!

69
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,571
- No! Claire! No, no, Claire!
- Oh, God.

70
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:22,955
Oh, shit.

71
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,961
Everybody good?

72
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,754
- No!
- No!

73
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,684
Okay. Okay, so I think
we get this one to the DFW,

74
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,520
and then we hit them again.

75
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:48,105
Yeah. Yeah, you saw
that breeding ground, right?

76
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:49,774
We're done.

77
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:53,278
I got a call last week.

78
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,990
It's a real job, something I can do
to effectively change things.

79
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,201
- I gotta take it.
- They need us.

80
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,245
Are you saving these dinosaurs
because they need us,

81
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,581
or are you saving them
to absolve yourself?

82
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,667
- Claire.
- I mean, this is crazy.

83
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,501
Claire,

84
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,586
you're doing the right thing.

85
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:14,091
But this... This isn't the way
to go about it anymore.

86
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,111
Honestly, you need someone
who's good at being shot at.

87
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,974
Aren't you and Owen still,
like, a weird thing?

88
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,017
- It's not that weird.
- He didn't mean "weird."

89
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,644
- Mm-mmm.
- No.

90
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,020
Uh, he meant, like, surprising.

91
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,918
Hyah!

92
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,977
Let's bring 'em home!

93
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,187
Hyah!

94
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:31,918
Hyah!

95
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,279
No.

96
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,461
Okay, come here.

97
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,049
Okay.

98
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,927
Hey, hey.

99
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,815
We're gonna get you
someplace safe.

100
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,196
Hey.

101
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,283
There you go.

102
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,159
There you go.

103
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,245
Yeah.

104
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:28,909
Shit.

105
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:40,713
Poaching's three to five.
Y'all know that.

106
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,592
Looks like we'll be
taking that animal off your hands.

107
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:45,677
Like hell you will.

108
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,721
All right. Seems our friend
don't recognize the badge.

109
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,976
Department of Fish and Wildlife.

110
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,315
We're rounding up that dinosaur
for its own safety.

111
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:01,485
That's funny.

112
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,865
'Cause my friends here,
they typically know all the new recruits.

113
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,427
Shep, do you remember meeting these guys
in orientation or not?

114
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,035
Nope.

115
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,792
Dinosaur bone powder goes for what?
3000 an ounce?

116
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,126
Makes this animal here worth about...

117
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,087
Shoot, $500,000?

118
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,217
How y'all want this to go, huh?

119
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,138
Your bones ain't worth nothing to me.

120
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,432
Hey, brother.

121
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,434
He ain't lying.

122
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:54,955
I'll see you around.

123
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,298
Never seen you walk away
from a fight before.

124
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,596
Yeah.

125
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:13,932
I got obligations.

126
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:20,915
Shouldn't you be in school?

127
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,666
I'm homeschooled.

128
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,003
That so?

129
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,173
And where's home?

130
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,182
I don't know!

131
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,851
Whoa!

132
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,019
Better not stand there, man.

133
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,942
Holy crap.

134
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,448
What in the world, man?

135
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,222
So, the dinosaurs...

136
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:29,877
Hey.

137
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,048
Where you been?

138
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,884
Nowhere.
What are you burning?

139
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,804
Oh, nothing. Just some old blankets.

140
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,724
You sure you didn't go past the bridge?

141
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,537
That's the look you give me
when you think I'm lying.

142
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,729
- Well, are you?
- No.

143
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,065
Maisie, you're literally looking
everywhere but here.

144
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,275
I said I didn't go past the bridge.

145
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:57,614
Maisie,

146
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,281
can we start over?

147
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,219
I know, Claire. There are people out there
who'll do anything to find me.

148
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,119
I'm not angry.

149
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,207
- That means you don't have to be angry.
- I'm not angry.

150
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,501
- I can take care of myself.
- Hey.

151
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:14,588
It's okay for us to depend on each other.
That's what people do.

152
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,633
How would I know what people do?

153
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:20,804
The only people I've spoken to
in the past four years are you both.

154
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,891
Besides,
I'm not even a real person anyway.

155
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,977
- What?
- I was made from someone else.

156
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:29,895
I'm not me.

157
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,531
You are the only you who ever was.

158
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:43,910
What?

159
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,453
- N-No.
- Was that, like, really corny?

160
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:47,704
It was so corny.

161
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,500
- Can we keep that between us?
- Can't promise that.

162
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,465
- Hey, kid.
- Hello.

163
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,634
Sorry I'm late.

164
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,887
Aw.

165
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,597
You smell like horses.

166
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,892
- Mmm.
- Oh, you like that, do ya?

167
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,144
- I do. Yeah.
- Oh.

168
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,895
Okay. Um...

169
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,566
I'm gonna make dinner.

170
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,567
Everything okay?

171
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,944
She went into town again.

172
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:24,116
Ah, this kid.
Did you talk to her?

173
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:25,868
I tried.

174
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,830
I'll talk to her.

175
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,673
Slow breaths. Take your time.

176
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,868
Hey. Cut away from yourself.

177
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:37,291
Whoa!

178
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,420
Wanna know how to win
a knife fight?

179
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:42,922
You gotta let yourself get cut.

180
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:45,299
Make sure they're cutting
something dispensable

181
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:46,884
while you're cutting something vital.

182
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,136
And then say something cool like...

183
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,390
"Wrong girl, wrong time."

184
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,683
Wrong girl, wrong time.

185
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:55,852
Whoo!

186
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:57,936
- Stone-cold.
- Right?

187
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,772
- I would not mess with her.
- No way.

188
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,615
Listen. We should probably
talk about you going into town.

189
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:10,866
I don't...

190
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,390
I don't think you understand
how bad it is being trapped here.

191
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,580
You're not trapped here.
We just don't trust people.

192
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,082
No, you just don't trust me.

193
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,625
And then you expect me to trust you.

194
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,046
- Why can't I have any freedom?
- Because you can't.

195
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:29,969
That went great.

196
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:31,887
What is happening?

197
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,932
- She's 14.
- Yeah.

198
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:36,433
You remember what that was like.

199
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,685
I do.

200
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,565
We can't keep her here forever.

201
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:46,152
If we don't figure this out, she's gonna
go a lot farther than the bridge.

202
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,195
If they find her,
we're never gonna see her again.

203
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,865
We gotta protect her. That's our job.
That's what we're gonna do.

204
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,075
Protect her how?

205
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,992
By locking her inside?

206
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:57,413
She's got questions.

207
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,916
You know? Questions we can't answer.

208
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,628
She wants to know who she is.

209
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,343
Who Charlotte Lockwood was.

210
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,974
Tracked Grady to his house.

211
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,936
You were right. Raptor's got a juvenile.

212
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,606
But listen, there's something else.

213
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,777
I found that girl you've been after.

214
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:43,875
Here you go.

215
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,241
Thanks for coming.

216
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,243
Wasn't sure who to call.

217
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:04,248
Fish and Wildlife didn't even want
to see it if it wasn't a dinosaur.

218
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:06,625
Yeah, well,
they get all the attention.

219
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,461
You guys want to vary
the sampling plots

220
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:09,545
a hundred yards each?

221
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,422
These your students?

222
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:15,718
Yeah. We've been looking into the impact
of industrial farming on the environment.

223
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,261
So, this is right up our alley.

224
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:20,306
They hit 60 fields
in the county.

225
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,017
You seen anything like
this before?

226
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,269
No. Not like this.

227
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:28,355
They've been leaving degraded fields
all across the Midwest.

228
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:33,109
First these big companies try to kill off
all the insects, now this.

229
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,080
Is that your land?

230
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,000
That's the Bennetts' corn.
The locusts didn't eat that.

231
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:50,419
<i>You plant the same seed
as the Bennet is?</i>

232
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,503
No.

233
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,631
We're independent.

234
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:57,175
They use Biosyn seed.

235
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,180
Yeah, I bet they do.

236
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,349
You say you caught a live one?

237
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,771
Kids, this is Dr. Ellie Sattler.

238
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,898
She's a scientist from the university.

239
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:13,442
A bug scientist?

240
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,528
Uh, sort of.

241
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,989
I study plants from a long time ago,

242
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:21,992
and that helps me figure out
how to protect plants and soil now.

243
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:25,121
Wow. Look at that.

244
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,667
Pretty cool, huh?

245
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,546
This is called a field sequencer,

246
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:37,133
and it helps me read DNA
everywhere I am.

247
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:41,429
I'm gonna put this swab in his mouth.

248
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,432
Good job.

249
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:49,353
And now, I need to take your little buddy
on a road trip.

250
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,895
Where are you taking it?

251
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,525
I need a second opinion.

252
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,365
- Hey, Madeline?
- Yeah?

253
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:03,992
We just gotta clean out
this little cylinder.

254
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,911
Okay. Let her down slow.

255
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,539
- Got it?
- Yeah.

256
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,000
Easy.

257
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,711
Let's start padding that other side.

258
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,130
Just about there. I'm on it.

259
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,965
Why do we dig?

260
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:24,805
Because paleontology is science,
and science is about the truth.

261
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,848
And there is truth in these rocks.

262
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,019
Stop.

263
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:35,023
It says here
that the T. rex had a tiny brain.

264
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:38,861
Well, it turns out that T. rex
was way smarter than we thought.

265
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,279
Capable of memory, of loyalty.

266
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,115
That's a T. rex.

267
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,659
They've been around
since, like, the '90s.

268
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,744
I don't get why we're here
digging up bones.

269
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:51,039
It just seems kinda random.

270
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,249
Right.

271
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:53,666
Grant!

272
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,295
You're gonna want to see this.

273
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,381
Guys, can you help me?

274
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,384
I'll pack it out.
I'll make sure nobody else crosses it.

275
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,142
Ellie Sattler.

276
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,104
Alan Grant.

277
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:15,189
You look the same.

278
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:20,443
And this place, it's so...

279
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:23,614
so, uh... you.

280
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,536
I'm sorry. If I'd known
you were coming, I would've...

281
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:31,997
Uh...

282
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,127
Can I get you something?
A beer or...

283
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:42,258
Um, well, maybe not at 10:00 a.m.,
but iced tea or...

284
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,759
Tea. Yeah.

285
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,009
Tea. I can do that.

286
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:49,222
Saw a lot of tourists
on the way in.

287
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:55,104
Well, the funding's dried up,
so somebody's gotta pay for all this.

288
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,605
Right. Thank you.

289
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:02,987
I read your articles about soil science
and regenerative farming.

290
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,279
That's great.

291
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,364
Thanks.

292
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:07,490
Gave me grounds
for some hope for a change.

293
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,951
And the one about growing algae.

294
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,579
Mmm! Alan, it's amazing.

295
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:15,374
It's a totally viable
carbon-neutral fuel.

296
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:19,336
It's incredible. Our answers
are in our oceans and in our soil.

297
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,980
Sure, it's gonna take work,
but we're on the verge of extinction.

298
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,883
My God. What are we gonna do?
Just sit around?

299
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,593
Not on my watch.

300
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,760
What?

301
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,472
No, nothing. I just...

302
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,976
Just like listening to you is all.

303
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,770
So, you're here on your own?

304
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:39,815
Yeah, yeah. On my own.

305
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:42,902
How are your kids?

306
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,028
Mmm.

307
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:47,780
Amazing. Grown. It's shocking.

308
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:50,241
They're both in college.
Can you believe that?

309
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:51,618
And Mark?

310
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,704
It's over.

311
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:57,208
Oh.

312
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,544
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

313
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,046
It's okay.

314
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,881
I'm back to me.

315
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,008
And my work. You know, it's...

316
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,092
That's great.

317
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,261
It's good. It is. I'm alone at last.

318
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:11,846
Exciting times.

319
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:14,432
Yeah, I'm living the Alan Grant life.

320
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:16,143
- It's just...
- Can be lonely.

321
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:17,478
...so freeing.

322
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:21,606
Ellie.

323
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:27,613
You didn't come out all this way
just to catch up, now, did you?

324
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,035
Well, that's a locust.

325
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,828
Mandibles, wings, thorax, but...

326
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:38,624
God, the size of it is massive.

327
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:43,671
It has genes that have been extinct
since the Cretaceous.

328
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:47,132
And swarms of them are decimating crops
from Iowa to Texas.

329
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:49,134
Terrifying, right?

330
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:51,720
Started as a few hundred.

331
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:53,888
There could be millions
by the end of the summer.

332
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:58,434
If they keep going, there'll be
no grain to feed chickens, cattle.

333
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,688
The entire food chain
would collapse.

334
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,857
Well, it's clearly designed,
but why would anyone do that?

335
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,863
None of the crops they're eating
are Biosyn seed.

336
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,198
Biosyn.

337
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,701
You're saying Biosyn made this?

338
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:17,579
I mean, it would not shock me that they
wanna control the world's food supply.

339
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,124
Not before a few million starve.

340
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:24,502
Yeah, what is that saying?
How we're three meals away from anarchy?

341
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:27,964
If we don't stop them,
you can pick your last three meals.

342
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:31,759
So, why are you bringing it to me?

343
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:35,681
I need concrete evidence
Biosyn's responsible for all this.

344
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:39,684
I need to go to their sanctuary
and get DNA from another locust there.

345
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,855
But I need a witness.

346
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,106
Alan.

347
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,484
You command respect.
People believe you.

348
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,528
Ellie.

349
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:53,865
You know why I'm here.
It's quiet. I'm done with all that.

350
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,159
Are you? Okay.

351
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,786
Well, I'm sorry, Alan.

352
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,498
Nobody gets that luxury anymore,
not even you.

353
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:02,583
And you know what?

354
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,126
You're the one I trust.

355
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:13,385
This Biosyn sanctuary is, what,
a hundred miles from anywhere?

356
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,802
How do you even get in there?

357
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:18,641
I got an invite
from their in-house philosopher.

358
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,894
Seems there's a lot of money
in being a chaotician these days.

359
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:26,398
And he just happened
to invite you out of the blue?

360
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:29,025
He said there were things I'd wanna see.

361
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,152
Uh-huh.

362
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,576
You coming or what?

363
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:47,210
It's clear!

364
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,297
Keep it going. That's good.

365
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:55,010
Every animal captured
on the mainland comes through here

366
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:57,804
before shipping out
to Biosyn's sanctuary in the Dolomites.

367
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,849
We give them medical attention
and make sure they leave healthy.

368
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,059
So much security.

369
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,894
Those are just the ones you see.

370
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,188
A lot of shady types out there
want these guys.

371
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:11,443
- Hey.
- Your plane's just fueling up.

372
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:15,197
Biosyn's a tough invite.
You guys must know somebody.

373
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,032
- Do you mind if I...
- Of course.

374
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,577
Hello.

375
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:23,454
You see me?
You follow me.

376
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:26,083
We rescued these guys
from an illegal breeding farm

377
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,710
in Nevada a few weeks ago.

378
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,878
Shut the whole place down.
Anonymous tip.

379
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:34,717
Good girl. Yes. Yes.

380
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,594
Alan. You never get used to it.

381
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,389
Okay. We're good. Close it up!

382
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:41,931
- Take care.
- Thank you. Bye.

383
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,016
Okay.

384
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,721
Hey.

385
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,474
You look just like Blue.

386
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,563
This?

387
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,523
You wanna try it?

388
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,650
Okay.

389
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:43,242
Huh.

390
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,291
Maisie, don't move.

391
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,338
Hey, girl.

392
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:56,465
Staying out of trouble?

393
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,050
She had a baby. That's impossible.

394
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:04,764
- Back up.
- She won't hurt us, right?

395
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,307
You're damn right she will.

396
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,851
Just breathe.

397
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,436
- If you don't, she'll think you're scared.
- I am scared.

398
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,148
Nah.
She doesn't need to know that.

399
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,576
Her nest has got to be nearby.
Maisie, get inside.

400
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,619
- I'm coming with you.
- What did I just say?

401
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,423
- We gotta move.
<i>- Not yet. We need the girl.</i>

402
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:42,802
Hey, what's up?

403
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:43,887
Wow.

404
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,182
Maisie?

405
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,101
Maisie?

406
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:56,108
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

407
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:57,775
Where you going?

408
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,695
You can't keep me here.
You're not my mother.

409
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,911
She's leaving the house.

410
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,394
Get in the truck!
Come on! Let's go!

411
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,646
Got it!

412
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:35,873
- Tie it down!
- Hold on.

413
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:36,898
Come on. Let's go!

414
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,360
- Get in!
- Come on!

415
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,322
Let's get out of here.

416
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,550
Who are you?

417
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:26,364
Claire!

418
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,240
They found her.

419
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,784
What? Who are they?

420
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,702
Poachers. I've seen them around.

421
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,704
Leader's a real shit-heel.

422
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,791
He must have recognized me,
followed me here.

423
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,960
- Where is she?
- Go get the truck.

424
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,126
Oh, my God.

425
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,882
Oh, God.

426
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,304
- Owen!
- Hey. No.

427
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:55,351
They took her kid too.

428
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,483
I am gonna get her back.

429
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,568
I promise you that.

430
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,121
Come on.

431
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,331
I know who to call.

432
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,514
<i>Please, please! No, no!</i>

433
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:37,728
This year, man.
What's next?

434
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:38,978
Historically?

435
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:42,356
Uh, darkness, blood, rain of fire.
I think frogs.

436
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,293
We're not gonna be around
for much longer anyway.

437
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,318
These locusts in Nebraska
are about to wrap it up.

438
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,695
They're eating the corn, wheat.

439
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,822
Basically all of our food
and our food's food.

440
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,742
So, we can say goodbye to this.

441
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:55,829
Hello?

442
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,164
<i>Franklin. It's me. You at work?</i>

443
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:00,416
Okay, you're kind of
a subject of interest around here,

444
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,210
so I can't really be talking to you.

445
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,920
<i>Come on. I'm in trouble.
I really need your help. Please.</i>

446
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:06,255
Yeah, and I could lose my job,

447
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,340
and you know I'm not qualified
to do anything else.

448
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:09,550
<i>We're outside.</i>

449
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:12,846
<i>Let me talk to him.</i>

450
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,934
- That him?
- That's him.

451
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:23,106
Name's Rainn Delacourt.
Real piece of work.

452
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,190
What'd he take?

453
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,485
Something we care about
very much.

454
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,155
Oh, shit. I told you somebody
would come looking for her.

455
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,074
You can't just take a person, Claire.

456
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,117
- We had no choice.
- Not in the eyes of the law.

457
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:38,038
This guy is not the law.
Tell us how to find him.

458
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:40,706
Where'd you call me from?

459
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,670
We have a man on the inside
of Delacourt's operation.

460
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,380
There's an exchange in Malta
sometime tomorrow. Cash for cargo.

461
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:49,882
Was she with him?

462
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:54,012
There's no mention,
but we have people on the ground already.

463
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:55,472
One of them you know.

464
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:58,099
A lot of us got recruited by the CIA
after the park went down.

465
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,393
Barry's French intelligence now.

466
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,688
I need to talk to him.

467
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:06,858
You can't just call him.
He's deep cover.

468
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:08,693
Look, once we make
the bust in Malta,

469
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:10,987
our guys will see
if Delacourt knows where she is.

470
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,157
Our guys. Not you.

471
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,744
Promise me you won't go in there
with your vest and mess everything up.

472
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,039
Why would I do that?

473
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,543
Look, you guys are both crazy,

474
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:29,088
but you seem like you're good parents,
or whatever you're trying to be.

475
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,132
She's lucky to have you.

476
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:34,469
Don't get killed, okay?

477
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,155
I think we're almost there.

478
00:42:55,157 --> 00:42:56,157
Yeah.

479
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:11,797
Dr. Sattler. Dr. Grant.

480
00:43:11,882 --> 00:43:14,175
- Ramsay Cole, Communications.
- Oh, hey.

481
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:16,510
I have to warn you,
everyone's so excited to have you.

482
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,139
You guys are absolute legends
around here.

483
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,974
Mmm. You must be confusing us
with somebody else.

484
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:25,019
You know, it's great that you guys
are still so close with Dr. Malcolm.

485
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,938
I mean, sometimes you meet your heroes
and they disappoint you,

486
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:30,192
but he's exactly the way
you'd want him to be.

487
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,693
I mean, such motility of thought.
It's incredible.

488
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,570
How much time
have you spent with him?

489
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:38,824
Uh, well, I know that was sarcastic,
but honestly, not enough.

490
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:41,119
Oh, please. After you.
And watch your head.

491
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,313
Biosyn bought this land
for the amber deposits back in the '90s.

492
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:53,380
But we've managed
to turn it into a safe haven

493
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:54,882
for about 20 displaced species.

494
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:58,887
First generation came from Sorna.
Most of the Nublar dinosaurs are here too.

495
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,806
Took Fish and Wildlife three years
to catch the T. rex.

496
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,391
- The...
- The T. rex is here?

497
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:06,268
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

498
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,773
Arrived just before you guys.

499
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:29,000
<i>Aerial deterrent system, active.</i>

500
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:32,378
Restricted air space.
Protects the airborne life.

501
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,797
Keeps the pterosaurs below 500 feet.

502
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,882
Airborne?

503
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,052
Is that Dreadnoughtus?

504
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,554
What?

505
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,563
Beautiful, right?

506
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:55,025
The name means "fear nothing."
Well, I guess you know that.

507
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,528
- What do they graze on?
- Hawthorn and fern.

508
00:44:57,612 --> 00:45:00,949
All indigenous. Nothing stocked
except for the deer population.

509
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:03,867
It's a great mezzanine species
for the apex predator.

510
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:06,246
The apex predator?

511
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:07,871
Giganotosaurus.

512
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,041
At least for now.

513
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,887
You don't let people in there, right?

514
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:25,681
Uh, no. Our... Our research...

515
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:28,643
Our research outposts are connected
completely underground.

516
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,771
If we have to,
we can just herd the animals remotely

517
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:36,108
using a neuro-implant that sends
electrical signals directly to the brain.

518
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,610
Like shocks?

519
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,195
Uh... n-no, like signals.

520
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,157
Doesn't it strike you as a little bit...

521
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,617
- Cruel?
- Cruel.

522
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:48,829
Do you know how much voltage was
in the electric fences at Jurassic Park?

523
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:50,789
Yeah.

524
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,715
<i>Please join Dr. Ian Malcolm
at noon in the lecture hall</i>

525
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,592
<i>for the Ethics of Genetic Power.</i>

526
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,762
God, everyone's so young.

527
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:07,181
Well, it is part of our ethos
to attract the best and brightest.

528
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:08,766
Doctors.

529
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:13,938
Respected, renowned Dr. Sattler.
Dr. Grant. Hi.

530
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,148
Wow, this is big. I'm Lewis.

531
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:18,193
- Dodgson. Yeah.
- Hi.

532
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,045
- You're Lewis Dodgson?
- I am. How do you do?

533
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,987
We didn't expect
to actually see you here.

534
00:46:22,072 --> 00:46:24,282
Well, I wouldn't be anywhere else.

535
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:26,117
- Would you?
- No.

536
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:29,329
I mean, the people you see here
are changing the world.

537
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,829
Would you mind if we, um...

538
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:33,750
- Just to... It would mean a lot.
- Oh.

539
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,918
Do you wanna, um...

540
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,836
- Oh, great. Thank you so much.
- Oh.

541
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,340
- That's good. That's good. Thanks.
- Okay.

542
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:44,719
So, you are going to see
some remarkable things today.

543
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:48,514
We are unlocking the true power
of the genome.

544
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,932
We're this close. Believe me.

545
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,768
You'll make a fortune with that.

546
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:53,978
No, it's not about money.

547
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:57,356
No, we've already identified dozens
of applications for paleo-DNA.

548
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,985
We're talking about cancer,
Alzheimer's, autoimmune.

549
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,612
We will be saving lives.

550
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,572
- But... shh.
- I bet.

551
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:08,742
Um, anyway, I wish I could
take you around myself, but, uh, it's...

552
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:11,996
So, you're in more-than-capable hands
with Ramsay.

553
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:15,208
He's basically a young me.

554
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:19,920
Only smarter and, uh, taller.

555
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,213
Do you have food?

556
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:24,300
- Like, one of my bars?
- Pardon? Um...

557
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:26,385
No, never mind.
I-I'll find something.

558
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:30,764
So, I want to do more of this
later on, if we, um...

559
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:33,059
Oh! We booked you
a private pod...

560
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:34,643
- Right.
- ...for the trip out, so...

561
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:37,480
It's beautiful. You'll love it.
Through the caverns and everything.

562
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,231
You better hurry. Malcolm's on.

563
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:41,150
He's a bit of a contrarian,
but I like him.

564
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,193
He keeps us on our toes. Anyway.

565
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,487
Thank you for being here. It's...

566
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,452
Okay. Um, follow me, please.

567
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:53,663
What?

568
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:59,460
Human beings have no more right
to safety or liberty

569
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,463
than any other creature
on this planet.

570
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:08,427
We not only lack dominion over nature,

571
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:10,972
we're subordinate to it.

572
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,641
And now, here we are

573
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,894
with the opportunity to rewrite life
at our fingertips.

574
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:19,021
And just like nuclear power,

575
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:21,900
nobody knew what to expect
with genetic engineering,

576
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:25,820
but they pressed the button
and hoped for the best,

577
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,782
just like you are doing now.

578
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:32,911
Yep. You.

579
00:48:34,204 --> 00:48:39,791
You control the future
of our survival on planet Earth.

580
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:42,545
According to you,
the solution is genetic power.

581
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:46,007
But that same power
could devastate the food supply,

582
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:50,719
create new diseases,
alter the climate even further.

583
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:54,599
Unforeseen consequences occur.

584
00:48:55,391 --> 00:49:00,146
And every time, every single time...

585
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:03,608
we all act surprised?

586
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,318
Because deep down,

587
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,697
I don't think that any of us actually
believe that these dangers are real.

588
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,873
In order to instigate
revolutionary change,

589
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:26,838
we must transform human consciousness.

590
00:49:29,092 --> 00:49:31,094
Whoo!

591
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,429
Yeah!

592
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:35,974
- May am?
- Dr. Malcolm?

593
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,893
Very good. There you go.

594
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,746
I don't want to be rude
to my friends. Thank you.

595
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,938
Catch me on my way out.
Thanks, everybody.

596
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:44,898
Look at you,

597
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:48,777
and look at me, and look at you.

598
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,530
Wha... This is so trippy.

599
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,782
You look like you're doing well.

600
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:56,411
Well, I got five kids, you know,
whom I adore more than life itself, so...

601
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:57,744
expenses add up.

602
00:49:57,829 --> 00:50:01,873
You? Alan, are you...
You have any family or...

603
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:05,335
- No.
- So, I need to talk to you.

604
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:08,380
Yeah, I need to talk to you too.
Privately.

605
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,048
Do you two talk a lot?

606
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,302
- He slid into my DMs.
- He did what?

607
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:14,219
- It's urgent, Ian.
- What did you do?

608
00:50:14,304 --> 00:50:16,054
Seven minutes to midnight stuff.

609
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:18,557
The Doomsday Clock might be
about out of time,

610
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:23,438
but, as they say, it's always darkest
just before eternal nothingness.

611
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,481
What?

612
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:30,945
Locusts altered with Cretaceous-era DNA.

613
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,989
- That's not my field.
- But if these things continue to multiply,

614
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:37,242
we're talking about
cascading system-wide effects, Ian.

615
00:50:37,327 --> 00:50:38,786
Gosh, that's a drag.

616
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,039
- What is the matter with you?
- "Drag"?

617
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,161
Why, is there something special
you wanted me to do?

618
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,585
- How about give a damn?
- You know too much not to care.

619
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:48,838
Hey, I gave my opinion
robustly for years.

620
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,634
As expected, the sum of our human
endeavors has led to our annihilation,

621
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:56,887
and the only play now
is to take the time we have left and, uh...

622
00:50:57,472 --> 00:50:59,514
you know,
just like we always do, squander it.

623
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,684
Honestly, Ian, that's bullshit.

624
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:05,480
Can I offer you guys some joe?

625
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:08,940
Tyler, please, two cappuccinos.

626
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:10,360
I don't want a cappuccino.

627
00:51:10,443 --> 00:51:12,277
I could do, like, a cortado
or macchiato...

628
00:51:12,362 --> 00:51:15,322
Trust me, it's real tough, that jet lag.
This is gonna perk you right up.

629
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:23,246
The locusts are part of a larger project
called Hexapod Allies.

630
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:24,998
- I...
- You're right about their intent.

631
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,001
I started hearing rumors
six weeks ago.

632
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:29,586
I read your piece on decadence
and put two and two together.

633
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,840
- I was not raising my voice.
- You're beginning to. It's crescendoing.

634
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,217
They're proliferating wildly.

635
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,802
They're lasting three,
four times longer than they should.

636
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:40,472
And all my models are pointing
toward a global ecological collapse, Ian.

637
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,224
Downstairs, sublevel six.

638
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,268
That's where they keep
the locusts.

639
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,688
Look for a lab marked L4.

640
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:48,606
But wait, how are we
gonna get down there?

641
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:51,358
This looks so silky.
May I touch this blouse, by any chance?

642
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:52,443
Sure.

643
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:54,445
You know what it is?
Don't tell me. This is...

644
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:57,030
- You won't know it.
- ...sustainable bamboo.

645
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,367
- It is sustainable bamboo.
- That's why I said...

646
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,742
- How'd you know?
- I just know.

647
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:02,161
- It's amazing.
- Very amazing.

648
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,246
I've got cumin, cinnamon.

649
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:05,123
I've got allspice,
which is not very popular.

650
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:06,525
- I've got five-spice...
- Doctor.

651
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:08,251
...if you're into that kind of feel.

652
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,753
- Um, and let's talk milks.
- Yeah.

653
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,838
Okay, soy milk, yes?

654
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:16,007
- No.
- What just happened?

655
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:18,427
We're in.

656
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:34,652
<i>Sublevel six. Restricted.</i>

657
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:43,536
Lewis, you're not listening to me.

658
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:47,539
The locusts' prehistoric DNA has made them
stronger than they should be.

659
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:50,418
They're multiplying like crazy
and they're not dying.

660
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:53,003
- What part of this don't you understand?
- I do understand.

661
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:54,838
This is gonna be a global famine.

662
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,300
Hey, hey,
we can't anticipate everything.

663
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,260
We need to eradicate the ones we released.

664
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,219
- What?
- All of them.

665
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:02,554
- No. No.
- Like...

666
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:04,931
- Henry, we don't want to cause a panic.
- Like yesterday.

667
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:06,684
We want control.

668
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,811
There's no such thing.

669
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:22,617
When we're afraid,

670
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,786
what do we do?

671
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:26,454
What have we done before?

672
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:28,498
We follow through.

673
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:31,208
That's what we do.

674
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,293
Right?

675
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,130
Right.

676
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,967
We found the girl.

677
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:42,427
She's en route.

678
00:53:42,512 --> 00:53:44,679
- Cost me a fortune.
- What?

679
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,266
- Wait, you found her?
- Yeah, found them both.

680
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:48,643
Her and the little raptor.

681
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:53,815
Blue reproduced all on her own,
just like you said.

682
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,023
You're so smart, Henry.

683
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,110
That's why this works.

684
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:01,989
You understand the value
of these creatures.

685
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,490
You always have.
I do too.

686
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:07,452
We don't stop because of a, what,
little side project went south?

687
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:13,166
Hey, if they trace the locusts back to us,

688
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:14,668
they come for the dinosaurs.

689
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,086
All your work, gone.

690
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:20,007
Billions of dollars in assets, gone.

691
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,094
Diamonds with no one to mine them.

692
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:27,556
You really think
she's the solution?

693
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:31,768
Okay.

694
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,981
Everything involving the girl
goes through me, right?

695
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:39,652
Is she all right?

696
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,027
She better be.

697
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:45,282
She's the most valuable
intellectual property on the planet.

698
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:57,043
I said I'd call you.

699
00:54:57,128 --> 00:54:58,420
They land yet?

700
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:00,047
<i>Second plane is incoming.</i>

701
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,884
- Who said anything about a second plane?
- We flew them separately.

702
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,760
I'm not taking any chances.

703
00:55:04,844 --> 00:55:06,679
<i>And we'll need payment before delivery.</i>

704
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,806
I didn't like what happened last time.

705
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:12,101
Okay. Okay, just call me when it's done.

706
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:23,653
You said I was going someplace safe.

707
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:25,907
You are.

708
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:36,500
- Walk to the car.
- No.

709
00:55:37,126 --> 00:55:38,376
It's not a choice.

710
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:54,309
Fifty grand to fly one little raptor.

711
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:55,393
Not bad.

712
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,152
What's with the girl?

713
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,239
Not your problem.

714
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:16,623
Pleasure doing business.

715
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,170
We're ready. Let's go.

716
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,429
Owen.

717
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:36,184
Hi, Claire.

718
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:39,438
I thought you would've chosen
a quieter line of work.

719
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:43,275
I tried. My cousin and I opened a café.
I lasted three weeks.

720
00:56:43,985 --> 00:56:46,362
The way the world is headed,
it's hard to look away.

721
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,280
Delacourt was hired by Soyona Santos,

722
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,367
a broker
in the underground dinosaur trade.

723
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,661
We don't have intel on his cargo,

724
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:57,289
but once they make the exchange,
we'll see what they know about your girl.

725
00:56:57,373 --> 00:57:00,751
You can listen in,
but promise me you will not make contact.

726
00:57:00,835 --> 00:57:01,835
No.

727
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,407
There is a big underground market
for dinosaurs now.

728
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:12,262
Europe, Middle East, northern Africa,
it all comes through here.

729
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:25,192
Don't look at anyone,
don't talk to anyone.

730
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,110
Just try to blend in.

731
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:05,148
I'm okay.

732
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:19,413
Still flying for Santos, huh?

733
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,581
You must need money.

734
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:21,664
What's it to you?

735
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,793
I've got cargo.

736
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:26,920
A thousand kilos of dinosaur
to Palermo.

737
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:32,760
Lystrosaurus. Very rare.

738
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:36,387
I give you two thousands.

739
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:38,056
Eight.

740
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:42,311
He may be ugly, but he's got spirit.

741
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:50,527
- What are you gonna do with him?
- He's mine now. What do you care?

742
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:01,789
Yeah! Come on, man!

743
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:09,838
Yes!

744
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,516
You lost?

745
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,268
You're American.

746
00:59:23,936 --> 00:59:25,228
And that make us friends?

747
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:28,398
- Listen, I just got here and...
- Oh, no.

748
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,400
That was not an invitation. Here.

749
00:59:32,695 --> 00:59:33,820
Souvenir.

750
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:37,199
Go back to the hotel, you know,
throw some bath salts in a bath.

751
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:40,119
This place, not your vibe.

752
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,202
Wait.

753
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:43,581
- Look.
- Claire.

754
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:45,456
Claire.

755
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:47,333
I know this must feel exotic,

756
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:50,838
but if you mess with the wrong person
down here, you disappear.

757
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,922
You feel me?

758
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,007
Good luck, okay?

759
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,384
Wait.

760
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,262
- Wait.
- What is this?

761
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:01,347
- I need your help.
- I don't know you.

762
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,641
- I'm looking for someone.
- Don't do that.

763
01:00:03,726 --> 01:00:05,643
She is all alone. Please.

764
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:13,777
- That your daughter?
- Yes.

765
01:00:16,572 --> 01:00:17,989
Sorry, I can't get involved.

766
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:39,802
- Think I got him.
- Target on the move.

767
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:43,014
That's our undercover agent
with him.

768
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:44,974
Claire, he's headed underground.

769
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:46,458
<i>- You see him?</i>
- Yeah, I've got him.

770
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:49,938
All right, let's go.

771
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:52,315
<i>Team four,
need you to sweep spreading south.</i>

772
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:53,733
Come on!

773
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:58,822
<i>All units, take up bull's-eye position.</i>

774
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,201
This is Bravo One.

775
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:04,661
<i>Primary target in sight.
No sign of the girl.</i>

776
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,538
<i>Alpha team, stand clear.</i>

777
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:20,135
My people say the raptor arrived
in good condition.

778
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:22,887
You boys didn't cock this up.

779
01:01:22,972 --> 01:01:24,681
Color me amazed.

780
01:01:25,266 --> 01:01:28,059
I do have another job for you.
Short hop, money's double.

781
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:29,519
What's the cargo?

782
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,273
Atrociraptors.

783
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,233
Thoroughbreds.

784
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:36,568
Trained to kill.

785
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,320
- Kill who?
- Whoever they're told.

786
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:42,657
Laser marks the target, they attach
to the scent, don't stop till it's dead.

787
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,117
Inescapable.

788
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:46,411
Those idiots making hybrids
had it all wrong.

789
01:01:46,996 --> 01:01:50,331
You can't engineer loyalty.
You have to nurture it.

790
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:52,668
50,000 to fly them to Riyadh.

791
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,836
In or out?

792
01:01:55,713 --> 01:01:56,755
She's not here.

793
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,302
Where are we going?

794
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:04,637
Almost there.

795
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:12,204
<i>- That's the drop, let's go!
- Need eyes on...</i>

796
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,398
Weapons down! Eyes on them!

797
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:15,858
Hands in the air! Contact made!

798
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,318
Delacourt, on the floor now!

799
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:19,402
Get on the ground!

800
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:21,195
Delacourt! Stay with him!

801
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,447
Shit.

802
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,534
Get that truck out of here!

803
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:27,161
There goes Santos!

804
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,918
<i>Damn, we lost Delacourt.</i>

805
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:50,434
This is Bravo One.
Truck is approaching the underpass.

806
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:53,269
<i>Go.</i>

807
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:10,931
Man, come on! Roll it!

808
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,697
The girl, where is she?
Where did they take her?

809
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,199
- Get it off!
- Where is she?

810
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:32,161
I don't know! We handed her off to Santos.

811
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:34,371
I don't know
where they took her after that.

812
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,969
Claire, it's Santos, the woman in white.

813
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,052
I'll find her.

814
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:54,016
- Spread out.
- Bravo team, watch your six.

815
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:58,686
- Hey, hey! Hey!
- Hold it!

816
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:01,565
- Let them out.
- What?

817
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,442
You heard me.

818
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:29,967
<i>Merde.</i>

819
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,320
<i>Claire, do you have her?</i>

820
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:05,336
- We had some trouble.
- What kind?

821
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:08,715
<i>The parents, Grady and Dearing.
They're here.</i>

822
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:15,681
- Can you take care of it?
- Not for free.

823
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:18,057
Well, do it.

824
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,407
Okay, okay. Listen.

825
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:34,865
Oh!

826
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:35,951
No, no, no!

827
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:50,757
You don't use it on people.

828
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:51,967
Where's my daughter?

829
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,385
She wasn't yours to begin with.

830
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:58,056
Tell me.

831
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:00,976
Biosyn.

832
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,061
They're taking her to Biosyn.

833
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:11,610
You missed her.

834
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:13,112
She's gone.

835
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:13,090
Take my hand. Come on.

836
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:45,247
Hold on tight.

837
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:46,957
What?

838
01:08:57,842 --> 01:09:00,070
Do you remember how we used
to get the raptors in the truck?

839
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:01,095
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

840
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,349
- You're up.
- No.

841
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:07,435
At the last minute, dive roll.

842
01:09:08,145 --> 01:09:09,770
- I don't dive roll.
- You'll be fine.

843
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:12,314
I never got the timing right.

844
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,194
- Now?
- Any minute. Any minute now.

845
01:09:17,237 --> 01:09:18,863
- Now?
- No.

846
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:22,576
Now!

847
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:27,913
Yeah. Yeah, yeah!

848
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:30,375
Freeze!

849
01:09:37,716 --> 01:09:40,594
I'm flying us out of here.
Tell me where you wanna be dropped.

850
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:42,011
You ever flown to Biosyn?

851
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,472
<i>Owen! They took her to Biosyn.</i>

852
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:47,596
<i>There's an airfield
on the north side of the island.</i>

853
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:48,810
Go.

854
01:09:48,894 --> 01:09:51,313
You're under arrest. Stay where you are.

855
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:19,341
Right!

856
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:25,305
Heads up!

857
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:05,947
We made a lot of enemies today.
We gotta go.

858
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,198
- He'll be here.
- Uh-huh.

859
01:12:11,578 --> 01:12:13,287
Out of time, out of time.

860
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:16,666
There he is.

861
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:21,128
- Pull over.
- That's not how planes work.

862
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:28,761
Open the back.

863
01:12:47,654 --> 01:12:48,823
Come on!

864
01:12:54,244 --> 01:12:55,913
Hold on tight!

865
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:14,224
Oh, sh...

866
01:13:26,194 --> 01:13:27,194
Still got it.

867
01:13:35,537 --> 01:13:36,996
Are you... Are you hurt?

868
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,747
- Are you okay? You hurt?
- Yeah, yeah.

869
01:13:38,832 --> 01:13:40,792
- Where? Where are you hurt?
- Yeah.

870
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:43,502
- Where are you hurt?
- No, no. I'm okay. I'm okay.

871
01:13:44,212 --> 01:13:45,337
Are you okay? What...

872
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:49,050
- Arm hurts pretty bad. Is it bleeding?
- Are you all right?

873
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:51,176
I don't know.

874
01:13:51,261 --> 01:13:52,595
Am I? Am I?

875
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:55,014
Let me see.

876
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:59,101
- Is it... Is it cut?
- No. No.

877
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:00,185
No, you're okay.

878
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:01,270
- Okay.
- You're okay.

879
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:18,328
Kayla Watts.

880
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:20,539
You're welcome.

881
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:23,001
You don't look like you fly for Biosyn.

882
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:26,753
I'm gonna take that the way you meant it
and not the way it sounded.

883
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:29,548
I fly for whoever got a bag,
but we'll call this one a favor.

884
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,926
Those don't work. They broke.

885
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:36,722
I'll take you all to Biosyn,
but I can't promise it won't be dangerous.

886
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,809
You're willing to risk your life
for people you never met?

887
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:43,354
You wanna ask questions,
or you want a ride?

888
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:48,902
We'll take the ride.

889
01:14:56,201 --> 01:14:58,243
So this is
our habitat development lab.

890
01:14:58,328 --> 01:15:00,954
A lot of exciting discoveries
as of late.

891
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:03,500
We've brought back numerous species
in their purest form,

892
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:07,628
and I mean complete, untouched genomes,
like <i>Moros intrepidus.</i>

893
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:08,962
- What?
- Yeah.

894
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:12,216
Wow.

895
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:17,305
What about splicing DNA?

896
01:15:17,387 --> 01:15:19,140
You know, creating new species.

897
01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:22,060
Oh, no, Dr. Sattler,
we don't do that here.

898
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:23,582
We like to think we're more evolved.

899
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,765
Looks like we still have
some time left before your ride.

900
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:34,197
Uh, would you guys like to tour
the facilities yourselves?

901
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:38,451
Oh, uh, I mean, we could.

902
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,845
- Yeah, why not?
- Great.

903
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:44,373
I'll meet you guys at the hyperloop,
station three in about 30 minutes.

904
01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:47,042
Elevators are down this hall,
not those.

905
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:49,587
Those lead you
down to the sublevels.

906
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:51,814
You need special clearance
to get down there.

907
01:15:51,838 --> 01:15:53,298
- Oh, okay.
- Thirty minutes.

908
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:04,935
Here. Take this.

909
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:08,273
Okay?

910
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:09,356
Yep.

911
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:20,909
I'm really sorry
that it had to happen this way.

912
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:24,037
Yep, that's what kidnappers say.

913
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:27,332
Claire should never have
hidden you away.

914
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:29,543
You're way too important, Maisie.

915
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:35,713
You took her too?

916
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:37,719
Yeah.

917
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:41,055
We needed her
to help us understand you.

918
01:16:46,144 --> 01:16:48,020
Hey, Beta.

919
01:16:49,564 --> 01:16:50,856
You okay?

920
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:53,734
Did you say "Beta"? Is that her name?

921
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,612
I gave it to her.

922
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:57,654
Beta is pretty special.

923
01:16:58,363 --> 01:16:59,532
You know, when we made Blue,

924
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:02,784
we used monitor lizard DNA
to fill in the gaps in her genome.

925
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:06,747
Monitor lizards can reproduce
without a mate.

926
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:10,752
So Beta and Blue
are genetically identical,

927
01:17:10,835 --> 01:17:12,729
and that's what they have
in common with you and...

928
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:14,421
Charlotte.

929
01:17:17,175 --> 01:17:18,760
What do you know about Charlotte?

930
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:20,386
She died.

931
01:17:21,511 --> 01:17:22,971
A long time ago.

932
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:25,725
It broke my grandpa's heart.

933
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:28,978
So he made me.

934
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:32,731
No, Maisie. Actually, he didn't.

935
01:17:35,318 --> 01:17:37,319
Charlotte made you.

936
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:42,992
<i>I'm so excited for everyone to see
what we've been doing here.</i>

937
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:48,163
<i>There's new technology being made,
new science, like, every day almost.</i>

938
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:52,292
<i>And it's great to be in the center of...
Center of that.</i>

939
01:17:53,211 --> 01:17:58,591
Charlotte lived on Site B
with all of us till the storm.

940
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:01,802
She loved dinosaurs.

941
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:04,096
<i>- Charlotte, be careful.
- Yeah, I will.</i>

942
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,140
She grew up around scientists.

943
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:08,475
And eventually...

944
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:11,938
she became one herself.

945
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,231
<i>A butterfly flew
info my office this morning.</i>

946
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:18,610
<i>They say tiny things have huge impacts,
and I agree wholeheartedly.</i>

947
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:19,695
She was brilliant.

948
01:18:19,779 --> 01:18:22,448
<i>For all my work with creatures,
wings flapping...</i>

949
01:18:22,532 --> 01:18:24,158
In ways that I'll never be.

950
01:18:24,242 --> 01:18:28,037
<i>In the metaphysics of identity,
can a replica truly be the original?</i>

951
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:31,582
<i>And if it's possible, what makes it so?</i>

952
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:38,256
<i>I've lost my pen.</i>

953
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:43,301
Is that me?

954
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:45,805
Yeah.

955
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:49,516
Just like Blue, Charlotte was able
to have a child all by herself.

956
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:54,104
She created you with her own DNA.

957
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:57,442
So I do have a mother.

958
01:18:57,524 --> 01:19:00,694
Your grandfather didn't want
anyone to know the truth.

959
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:03,322
He was protecting her, and you.

960
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:05,992
And we're the same?

961
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:09,203
You were.

962
01:19:09,953 --> 01:19:13,457
When you were a baby, Charlotte started
to show symptoms of a genetic disorder.

963
01:19:14,207 --> 01:19:16,210
That's how she died.

964
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:18,921
She didn't know she had it
until after you were born.

965
01:19:20,131 --> 01:19:21,631
- Do I have it too?
- No.

966
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:25,386
She changed your DNA.

967
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:30,015
She altered every cell in your body
to eradicate this disease.

968
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,269
No one on earth has ever known
how to do that.

969
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:35,645
She fixed me.

970
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:38,231
Charlotte's discovery
is a part of you now.

971
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:43,029
Your DNA could change the world.

972
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:48,117
And I have to know how she did it,
but I just can't replicate her work.

973
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:53,038
If I could just study you and Beta,
whose DNA was never changed, I could...

974
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:58,586
fix a terrible mistake that I've made.

975
01:19:58,668 --> 01:20:00,462
What kind of mistake?

976
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:10,972
<i>Sublevel six. Restricted.</i>

977
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:16,854
Thanks for coming.

978
01:20:21,943 --> 01:20:25,070
- Which lab did Malcolm say?
- L4.

979
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:31,034
This is it.

980
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:54,182
Okay. Get in,
get the sample and get out.

981
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:55,268
And move slow.

982
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,811
They can swarm
at the slightest disturbance.

983
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,212
Orthoptera.

984
01:21:25,922 --> 01:21:27,007
Two weeks.

985
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:33,805
Fully mature. This one.

986
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:38,060
Ready? Easy.

987
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:44,942
Okay. Go.

988
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:47,612
What?

989
01:21:49,113 --> 01:21:50,405
Go get it.

990
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:53,743
Is that necessary?

991
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:56,244
Wh-What did you think was gonna happen?

992
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:59,457
I have to take a sample.
We need concrete evidence. This is it.

993
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:02,667
Alan, you said there was no time.
Can you get it?

994
01:22:03,336 --> 01:22:04,587
Of course I can get it.

995
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:07,006
Okay. Easy.

996
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:10,717
Watch its legs.

997
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:13,762
Ugh. Yech.

998
01:22:13,845 --> 01:22:15,305
Here we go.

999
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:19,726
They're cell signaling between them.
This is not good, Ellie.

1000
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:20,978
I almost got it.

1001
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:27,525
How does she remain an asset, Henry,
if you're incriminating both of us

1002
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:30,070
by showing her classified things
on the computer?

1003
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:33,490
<i>Charlotte Lockwood believed
the methods used at Jurassic Park</i>

1004
01:22:33,573 --> 01:22:34,574
<i>could cure disease.</i>

1005
01:22:35,242 --> 01:22:36,409
<i>She was right.</i>

1006
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:40,664

Hey, do you wanna get out of here?

1012
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:09,734
What the...

1013
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:12,512
Got it.

1014
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:22,622
Oh, my God!

1015
01:23:22,707 --> 01:23:24,375
They're everywhere! Help me!

1016
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:27,336
Oh, God! No!

1017
01:23:28,295 --> 01:23:31,673
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1018
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:38,764
Maisie.

01:24:08,586 --> 01:24:09,587
Oh, God!

1025
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:23,850
You okay?

1026
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,686
Yeah. You?

1027
01:24:27,645 --> 01:24:28,646
Yeah.

1028
01:24:31,317 --> 01:24:32,609
Oh.

1029
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:42,828
You're Dr. Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant.

1030
01:24:42,912 --> 01:24:44,371
You were at Jurassic Park.

1031
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:47,082
What are you doing here?

1032
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:49,085
What? What...

1033
01:24:49,752 --> 01:24:50,920
What are you doing here?

1034
01:24:53,506 --> 01:24:54,798
I'm Maisie Lockwood.

1035
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:07,685
Uh, hey, we don't, uh...

1036
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:10,773
We're not...
We don't work for Biosyn.

1037
01:25:10,855 --> 01:25:11,981
I can tell.

1038
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:14,527
- We gotta get out of here.
- Yeah, we should go.

1039
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:32,795
Okay. In and out.
We find your girl and go.

1040
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:37,800
Tower, this is N141. Request to land
for freight delivery. Over.

1041
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:39,385
N141, negative.

1042
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:42,220
We've been advised you're carrying
unauthorized passengers. Over.

1043
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:45,975
<i>Copy that, Tower.
Be advised shipment is perishable.</i>

1044
01:25:46,057 --> 01:25:48,394
<i>We need immediate clearance.
It's an emergency. Over.</i>

1045
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:49,478
There isn't... No.

1046
01:25:50,688 --> 01:25:52,648
Negative.
Return to point of origin.

1047
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:55,775
You seem to be breaking up.
Are you hearing me on your side?

1048
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:58,028
<i>May need to check systems.</i>

1049
01:25:58,112 --> 01:26:00,029
Nice try, Kayla.
They will down your bird.

1050
01:26:00,948 --> 01:26:03,242
Who is this?
Is this Denise?

1051
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:06,996
<i>You do not want me to start spilling
secrets, Denise. You remember Dubrovnik.</i>

1052
01:26:08,956 --> 01:26:09,957
She's...

1053
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:13,460
Different Denise, in accounts.

1054
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:24,305
Talked to Santos.
It's the girl's parents.

1055
01:26:27,224 --> 01:26:28,893
Let's shut off the ADS.

1056
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:30,603
Are you sure?

1057
01:26:31,811 --> 01:26:32,813
Uh-huh.

1058
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:40,945
What's that?

1059
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:42,280
Uh...

1060
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:44,699
That's the, uh...
That's the Aerial Deterrent System.

1061
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:47,536
- Keeps the airborne life away.
- Why is it blinking?

1062
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:49,662
Dead ass Denise in the tower
just turned it off.

1063
01:26:49,747 --> 01:26:51,957
We gotta get out of this airspace
right now.

1064
01:26:56,337 --> 01:26:59,256
- That's another plane, right?
- Not exactly.

1065
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:04,886
- Is that a...
- Quetzalcoatlus.

1066
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:07,597
Late Cretaceous,
should have stayed there.

1067
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:16,231
Okay. Okay.

1068
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:18,359
It's cool. We're good. It's gone.

1069
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:37,127
This plane is going down!

1070
01:27:37,211 --> 01:27:40,256
If you're gonna eject,
you need to do it now!

1071
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:43,341
- I only got one chair, and she's in it.
- You don't have parachutes?

1072
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:45,594
I wasn't expecting company!

1073
01:27:53,394 --> 01:27:56,145
Claire! We gotta get you off this plane.

1074
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:57,314
What?

1075
01:27:57,398 --> 01:27:59,108
The parachute is gonna open automatically.

1076
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:01,944
If it doesn't, you pull this lever.
Do you understand me?

1077
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:04,279
Claire!
If it doesn't open automatically,

1078
01:28:04,363 --> 01:28:06,364
you're gonna pull
this lever behind you. Okay?

1079
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:07,908
Ten thousand feet!

1080
01:28:07,992 --> 01:28:09,993
Hey, you're the one
who's gotta go to get to her.

1081
01:28:10,077 --> 01:28:12,037
You're her mom.
You're her only shot.

1082
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:16,250
I'll see you again.

1083
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:19,336
I love you.

1084
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:10,179
What's the plan?

1085
01:29:10,261 --> 01:29:13,181
Whatever happens. That's the plan.

1086
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:28,738
- Three.
- This way.

1087
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:32,283
- Alan, we need the code.
- Let's try this thing.

1088
01:29:32,368 --> 01:29:33,368
Yeah.

1089
01:29:33,409 --> 01:29:35,328
Get down.

1090
01:29:41,085 --> 01:29:43,503
- Thank God it's you!
- I know.

1091
01:29:43,587 --> 01:29:45,338
- This place is a maze.
- Good you're here.

1092
01:29:45,421 --> 01:29:47,548
We were so confused.
I thought we were lost.

1093
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:49,801
Then you said station three.
And I was like, here...

1094
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:51,095
Do you have the sample?

1095
01:29:51,845 --> 01:29:53,284
- What?
- What are you talking about?

1096
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:55,099
The DNA sample. Do you have it?

1097
01:29:55,681 --> 01:29:57,725
Biosyn's responsible
for the locust epidemic.

1098
01:29:57,810 --> 01:29:59,895
Dodgson's covering it up.
You were right.

1099
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:01,438
I'm here to help you.

1100
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:02,605
Do you have it?

1101
01:30:03,564 --> 01:30:04,565
Yeah.

1102
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:05,650
Good.

1103
01:30:06,652 --> 01:30:08,404
This pod will take you
to the airfield.

1104
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:10,113
We have a plane ready to fly.

1105
01:30:10,197 --> 01:30:12,615
- Ian told you about Hexapod Allies?
- No.

1106
01:30:12,698 --> 01:30:13,867
I told him.

1107
01:30:13,951 --> 01:30:14,952
What?

1108
01:30:15,536 --> 01:30:17,537
- Okay. You guys gotta go.
- Wait.

1109
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:23,210
Maisie.

1110
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:27,922
Maisie Lockwood.

1111
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:32,176
Go.

1112
01:34:39,675 --> 01:34:41,885
Okay.

1113
01:34:47,224 --> 01:34:48,766
That was my baby.

1114
01:34:50,394 --> 01:34:52,145
Okay, okay.

1115
01:34:57,317 --> 01:34:59,194
Where'd you learn to fly?

1116
01:34:59,277 --> 01:35:02,698
Uh, Air Force.
Legacy on my mama's side.

1117
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:04,115
Yeah. I'm Navy.

1118
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:07,411
Okay, so how'd you end up doing this?

1119
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:09,496
I was a legit contract pilot
for a grip,

1120
01:35:09,578 --> 01:35:12,457
but it didn't exactly pay enough
to be out here sending money home.

1121
01:35:12,541 --> 01:35:15,292
So I hit up a few contacts
for the more lucrative shady shit.

1122
01:35:16,545 --> 01:35:19,296
Honestly, I might be done
with this line of work.

1123
01:35:19,881 --> 01:35:21,173
Is that why you're helping us?

1124
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:27,346
I was there
when they handed your girl off to Biosyn.

1125
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:32,101
I could have said something, but I didn't.

1126
01:35:32,185 --> 01:35:33,895
And when I saw her picture...

1127
01:35:36,398 --> 01:35:37,649
It isn't enough to do nothing.

1128
01:35:43,613 --> 01:35:44,698
Thank you.

1129
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:32,703
No.

1130
01:36:37,501 --> 01:36:38,502
Nope.

1131
01:37:02,818 --> 01:37:04,069
What an asshole.

1132
01:37:55,537 --> 01:37:56,537
You good?

1133
01:37:57,122 --> 01:37:59,791
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm not shook at all. You?

1134
01:37:59,875 --> 01:38:01,877
Nah. Nah, no.

1135
01:38:04,462 --> 01:38:06,672
Ejection seat beacon.
We'll find her.

1136
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:08,716
Okay, okay.

1137
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,051
You really love her, huh?

1138
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:13,137
Yeah.

1139
01:38:13,846 --> 01:38:14,847
I get it.

1140
01:38:16,224 --> 01:38:17,850
I like redheads too.

1141
01:38:19,101 --> 01:38:20,561
What? God.

1142
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:27,193
- Who is that?
- It's Grant and Sattler.

1143
01:38:27,277 --> 01:38:29,529
- Is this live?
- Twelve minutes ago.

1144
01:38:29,613 --> 01:38:32,489
We were tracking the escaped asset.
My guys missed it.

1145
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:34,451
They stole a DNA sample.

1146
01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:36,202
How'd they get in there?

1147
01:38:36,286 --> 01:38:38,913
They used an access key.
Yankee White clearance.

1148
01:38:40,372 --> 01:38:43,752
One of our cameras saw Ian Malcolm
put something in Sattler's pocket.

1149
01:38:44,711 --> 01:38:47,796
All right.
I want to see him.

1150
01:38:47,881 --> 01:38:49,673
And get Ramsay up here too,
will you?

1151
01:38:51,134 --> 01:38:53,761
- Where are they now?
- On the way to the airfield.

1152
01:38:53,845 --> 01:38:55,889
They caught the hyperloop
right on schedule.

1153
01:39:02,061 --> 01:39:03,063
How are you?

1154
01:39:04,271 --> 01:39:06,024
You all right?

1155
01:39:07,108 --> 01:39:08,359
Not really, no.

1156
01:39:10,737 --> 01:39:11,738
Hey.

1157
01:39:12,572 --> 01:39:14,908
I, uh, knew your mom.

1158
01:39:18,494 --> 01:39:19,537
You did?

1159
01:39:19,621 --> 01:39:20,913
Mm-hmm.

1160
01:39:22,414 --> 01:39:25,335
Yeah, a few years
after Hammond died,

1161
01:39:26,168 --> 01:39:29,130
she came to my university to lecture,

1162
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:32,216
and we became good friends.

1163
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:34,344
What was she like?

1164
01:39:34,426 --> 01:39:35,511
Brilliant.

1165
01:39:35,595 --> 01:39:38,722
Light-years ahead
of everybody else.

1166
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:41,016
And she had a conscience.

1167
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:43,228
While they were out
building theme parks,

1168
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:46,981
well, she was determined to prove
that genetic power could save lives.

1169
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,984
And I was her experiment.

1170
01:39:50,068 --> 01:39:51,528
No.

1171
01:39:53,738 --> 01:39:56,490
She wanted a child more than anything.

1172
01:39:56,573 --> 01:39:59,703
But she wanted you to have
what she couldn't.

1173
01:40:00,869 --> 01:40:02,413
A full life.

1174
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:07,252
I didn't know her long,

1175
01:40:08,168 --> 01:40:10,462
but I know she loved you very much.

1176
01:40:30,942 --> 01:40:32,109
What's happening?

1177
01:40:39,743 --> 01:40:41,953
This must be the old amber mines.

1178
01:40:42,037 --> 01:40:43,579
We're inside the mountain.

1179
01:40:43,662 --> 01:40:46,291
They must've made access doors
when they built these tunnels.

1180
01:40:48,417 --> 01:40:49,418
You ready?

1181
01:40:50,837 --> 01:40:51,880
I'm good.

1182
01:40:52,756 --> 01:40:54,173
No, that's not reasonable.

1183
01:40:54,256 --> 01:40:56,176
You want to go into the dark tunnel.

1184
01:40:56,717 --> 01:40:58,761
I want to stay in the bulletproof tube.

1185
01:40:59,386 --> 01:41:00,721
Who's being unreasonable?

1186
01:41:01,555 --> 01:41:04,641
But the bulletproof tube has no door.

1187
01:41:08,395 --> 01:41:09,605
Look, uh...

1188
01:41:13,068 --> 01:41:16,654
I know how you feel.
It's... It's scary. It is.

1189
01:41:17,447 --> 01:41:20,824
But trust me, moving forward
is better than staying still.

1190
01:41:20,908 --> 01:41:24,287
And Dr. Sattler here is
a good person in a tight spot,

1191
01:41:24,369 --> 01:41:26,163
and this is a tight spot.

1192
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:28,041
So, you coming?

1193
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:32,878
All right.

1194
01:41:58,363 --> 01:42:01,032
Hey, I heard the alarm.
Everything all right?

1195
01:42:01,114 --> 01:42:04,536
Yeah. No, no.
Nothing we can't, uh, handle. Listen...

1196
01:42:05,203 --> 01:42:06,703
- You rang?
- Oh, good.

1197
01:42:06,787 --> 01:42:09,164
Dr. Malcolm, you are...

1198
01:42:09,248 --> 01:42:11,417
- fired.
- What?

1199
01:42:12,252 --> 01:42:14,921
It was such a cushy gig.

1200
01:42:15,003 --> 01:42:19,509
You can give your access key to security
if you still have it.

1201
01:42:19,591 --> 01:42:22,177
One of the hyperloop pods
just shut down in the amber mines.

1202
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:23,720
What?

1203
01:42:23,805 --> 01:42:26,140
Wow. This day.

1204
01:42:26,224 --> 01:42:28,100
Uh, which... Which pod are we...

1205
01:42:28,184 --> 01:42:29,269
Are there, um...

1206
01:42:30,603 --> 01:42:32,020
dinosaurs in the mines?

1207
01:42:32,104 --> 01:42:33,605
There are dinosaurs everywhere.

1208
01:42:33,689 --> 01:42:36,317
Technically, birds are dinosaurs,
g-genetically speaking at least.

1209
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,569
Okay.
Lewis, Grant and Sattler are in this pod.

1210
01:42:38,653 --> 01:42:41,698
- We need to send a security team ASAP.
- Absolutely, Ramsay. Thank you.

1211
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:44,783
Let's all just stay in our lanes though.
We can take care of it.

1212
01:42:44,868 --> 01:42:45,993
Thank you, Doctor.

1213
01:42:46,077 --> 01:42:48,496
That's it, huh?
Nothing else to see here?

1214
01:42:48,579 --> 01:42:52,667
Uh, I'm not sure
I admire your tone right now.

1215
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:54,270
- You need to leave.
- Yeah, I do.

1216
01:42:54,293 --> 01:42:57,671
But first,
I owe all these folks an apology.

1217
01:42:57,755 --> 01:43:00,550
I think that by lending my cachet
to this joint,

1218
01:43:00,632 --> 01:43:03,427
I might've made it seem
as if Biosyn wasn't rotten to the core.

1219
01:43:03,511 --> 01:43:04,679
That's enough, Ian.

1220
01:43:04,761 --> 01:43:05,930
See, here's how they get you.

1221
01:43:06,014 --> 01:43:08,295
They give you so many promotions
in a short period of time

1222
01:43:08,349 --> 01:43:10,685
that it bludgeons your capacity
for critical thinking.

1223
01:43:10,768 --> 01:43:11,769
Oh, my God.

1224
01:43:11,853 --> 01:43:15,023
Then there are doors that you don't open,
things that you ignore.

1225
01:43:15,105 --> 01:43:20,653
But mainly, he's exploiting
your enchantment with these.

1226
01:43:20,737 --> 01:43:22,738
Is there an actual concern here,
or are you just...

1227
01:43:22,822 --> 01:43:26,868
You're racing toward the extinction
of our species, and you don't care.

1228
01:43:26,951 --> 01:43:29,996
You know exactly what you're doing,
but you won't stop.

1229
01:43:30,078 --> 01:43:31,122
You can't.

1230
01:43:31,706 --> 01:43:34,958
I thought you might be different,
but you're just like everyone else.

1231
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:36,502
You see what you want to see.

1232
01:43:36,586 --> 01:43:40,756
You imagine unchecked avarice,
so that's what you find.

1233
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:44,761
You envision, what,
an evil, unbound Prometheus,

1234
01:43:44,844 --> 01:43:47,180
- so that's what I am to you?
- Prometheus got gored.

1235
01:43:47,262 --> 01:43:50,307
So will you, you rapacious rat bastard.

1236
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:54,020
Ramsay, will you help Dr. Malcolm
gather his things?

1237
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:57,230
His room, and then to the airfield.
That's it.

1238
01:44:07,158 --> 01:44:08,158
Dodgson.

1239
01:45:41,627 --> 01:45:43,421
Allosaurus?

1240
01:45:44,963 --> 01:45:46,591
Giganotosaurus.

1241
01:45:46,673 --> 01:45:48,592
Largest known terrestrial carnivore.

1242
01:45:49,469 --> 01:45:51,929
He put two apex predators in one valley.

1243
01:45:52,012 --> 01:45:53,890
Pretty soon there's only gonna be one.

1244
01:46:25,630 --> 01:46:27,090
Did you feel that?

1245
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:30,259
That's an air current.

1246
01:46:30,967 --> 01:46:32,804
Must be an opening up ahead.

1247
01:46:33,970 --> 01:46:36,056
How old is this mine,
do you think?

1248
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:37,934
Just breathe.

1249
01:46:38,016 --> 01:46:40,394
Nobody panic.
Just watch out for bats.

1250
01:46:40,478 --> 01:46:42,278
- Who said anything about bats?
- I hate bats.

1251
01:46:42,354 --> 01:46:44,774
Well, there's probably no bats.
No falling rocks.

1252
01:46:45,358 --> 01:46:48,277
Just a possibility of toxic gas,
dehydration, hypothermia.

1253
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:50,613
Just possibilities, nothing for certain.

1254
01:46:50,695 --> 01:46:53,865
I should've left you where you were.
Why did I bring you into this?

1255
01:46:53,949 --> 01:46:56,828
- You were happy in your element.
- What? What? Ellie.

1256
01:46:56,911 --> 01:46:57,912
What?

1257
01:46:58,746 --> 01:46:59,913
I wasn't happy.

1258
01:47:01,498 --> 01:47:02,625
You weren't?

1259
01:47:02,707 --> 01:47:04,710
- Do you guys have kids?
- What?

1260
01:47:05,586 --> 01:47:08,797
Uh... no. I-I do. Two.

1261
01:47:09,381 --> 01:47:10,423
But not with him?

1262
01:47:12,342 --> 01:47:15,011
Uh... no.

1263
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:18,306
No, just old friends.

1264
01:47:18,850 --> 01:47:20,768
Uh, just old friends.

1265
01:47:21,978 --> 01:47:22,979
Really?

1266
01:47:28,024 --> 01:47:30,153
Won't be long
before security knows you're gone.

1267
01:47:30,735 --> 01:47:33,530
A map. That looks like an old map.
You don't have a new map?

1268
01:47:33,613 --> 01:47:36,492
There's an access gate
at the northeast corner of the mine.

1269
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:38,202
- If your friends make it out...
- If?

1270
01:47:38,286 --> 01:47:39,744
- When they make it out.
- Yes, sir.

1271
01:47:39,828 --> 01:47:41,079
That's where they'll be.

1272
01:47:41,831 --> 01:47:43,957
These roads are protected, right?

1273
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:45,292
Uh, yeah, I'd drive fast.

1274
01:47:57,137 --> 01:47:58,139
You did good.

1275
01:47:58,221 --> 01:48:01,809
Yeah. Well, actually,
it's a complete disaster, but thanks.

1276
01:48:02,935 --> 01:48:03,978
Not yet.

1277
01:48:40,972 --> 01:48:42,350
Lewis?

1278
01:48:42,432 --> 01:48:44,518
What? What are you doing down here?

1279
01:48:46,561 --> 01:48:47,979
Actually, no. This is good.

1280
01:48:48,064 --> 01:48:51,067
You sent a rescue team
into the mines for Grant and Sattler?

1281
01:48:51,149 --> 01:48:52,818
Yeah. What? Okay. Of course. Yeah.

1282
01:48:52,902 --> 01:48:56,322
- Are you deleting research files?
- Uh, we are. Yes.

1283
01:48:56,404 --> 01:48:59,033
You and I got to protect
what we've built, right?

1284
01:48:59,115 --> 01:49:01,953
You think they wouldn't love
to get their hands in here?

1285
01:49:02,036 --> 01:49:05,456
Take all the resources
I've spent decades collecting.

1286
01:49:05,538 --> 01:49:06,791
Just because, what?

1287
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:09,627
We made a bad call? It happens.

1288
01:49:10,252 --> 01:49:11,253
Seven.

1289
01:49:14,172 --> 01:49:15,173
Hexapod Allies.

1290
01:49:15,925 --> 01:49:17,801
What? Oh.

1291
01:49:19,595 --> 01:49:22,430
Okay. What do people know?

1292
01:49:22,515 --> 01:49:25,850
The locusts were designed to spread
genetic modifications to crops.

1293
01:49:26,935 --> 01:49:29,939
Protection against droughts,
frost, disease. A breakthrough.

1294
01:49:30,021 --> 01:49:32,440
- Goddamn right it was.
- Yeah. Only it didn't work.

1295
01:49:32,524 --> 01:49:35,444
You ensured they can't eat Biosyn seed,
so they're eating everything else.

1296
01:49:35,528 --> 01:49:37,488
Which I did not see coming.
We have a solution.

1297
01:49:37,570 --> 01:49:39,810
- Independent farmers suffered at first.
- Henry's on it.

1298
01:49:39,864 --> 01:49:42,702
Nobody cared much. Now the world's
food supply is verging on collapse.

1299
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:44,369
Find the girl, change the locusts' DNA.

1300
01:49:44,453 --> 01:49:46,913
- The trail's gonna lead back to you.
- We solve the problem.

1301
01:49:46,997 --> 01:49:48,416
Ramsay, thank you.

1302
01:49:51,335 --> 01:49:54,796
Disappears in the next news cycle,
just like everything else. This is not it.

1303
01:49:55,463 --> 01:49:56,465
81C1.

1304
01:49:56,548 --> 01:49:59,260
Or you could accept responsibility.

1305
01:50:00,677 --> 01:50:02,179
Share your research with the world.

1306
01:50:02,262 --> 01:50:03,264
Yep.

1307
01:50:04,724 --> 01:50:06,350
You know, I was 28 once. I get it.

1308
01:50:07,726 --> 01:50:08,935
You look around, you...

1309
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:13,189
realize you're surrounded by injustice
and cruelty and you wanna change it.

1310
01:50:13,274 --> 01:50:14,274
Yep.

1311
01:50:15,109 --> 01:50:16,944
And then you grow up,

1312
01:50:17,028 --> 01:50:19,238
somebody puts you in charge,

1313
01:50:20,323 --> 01:50:22,574
and you see that there is no changing it.

1314
01:50:25,618 --> 01:50:26,953
It's chomp or be chomped.

1315
01:50:28,581 --> 01:50:30,623
- Where are you going with that?
- Oh.

1316
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:34,420
We don't apologize for our mistakes.
We erase them.

1317
01:50:35,755 --> 01:50:37,422
Stay on your phone. I may need you.

1318
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:46,849
Watch yourself.

1319
01:51:06,118 --> 01:51:07,578
- Ellie?
- Yeah.

1320
01:51:12,792 --> 01:51:13,792
What was that?

1321
01:51:20,966 --> 01:51:22,092
Be careful.

1322
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:38,317
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1323
01:51:56,793 --> 01:51:57,920
Forget the hat!

1324
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:01,047
Come on!

1325
01:52:08,805 --> 01:52:09,806
Go, go, go!

1326
01:52:10,807 --> 01:52:12,350
Go, go, go, go, go!

1327
01:52:15,145 --> 01:52:16,439
There's no button.

1328
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:18,231
It's a car.

1329
01:52:20,234 --> 01:52:22,235
- Oh, my God. Ian!
- Ian, over here!

1330
01:52:23,863 --> 01:52:25,006
- Help!
- Please!

1331
01:52:25,029 --> 01:52:26,865
- Open the gate!
- Please help us!

1332
01:52:27,824 --> 01:52:30,425
- Do you know the code?
- I didn't know there was gonna be a code.

1333
01:52:31,787 --> 01:52:34,247
I didn't know there was gonna be a code.

1334
01:52:34,331 --> 01:52:35,875
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1335
01:52:37,835 --> 01:52:39,170
The brake!
Pull the brake!

1336
01:52:39,252 --> 01:52:41,005
There are 10,000 possibilities.

1337
01:52:41,087 --> 01:52:42,256
Push your legs against it!

1338
01:52:43,548 --> 01:52:46,176
- 1984.
- Come on, Ian!

1339
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:48,554
- Kick up against it!
- Hurry!

1340
01:52:49,054 --> 01:52:52,432
Miles Davis's birthday, 0526.

1341
01:52:57,229 --> 01:52:58,480
- Ian!
- Please. Please.

1342
01:52:58,564 --> 01:53:01,233
- Do something!
- We're not gonna make it.

1343
01:53:01,317 --> 01:53:03,319
Let's... Let's all try to stay positive.

1344
01:53:19,627 --> 01:53:22,630
- Please!
- I know. I know. I know!

1345
01:53:28,886 --> 01:53:30,345
Oh, my God!

1346
01:53:31,971 --> 01:53:33,765
What do you know?
It actually worked.

1347
01:53:40,064 --> 01:53:42,399
- Ian, this is Maisie.
- Hi, Maisie.

1348
01:53:42,483 --> 01:53:44,068
We got the DNA.

1349
01:53:45,694 --> 01:53:47,613
- We need to get out of this valley.
- Yeah.

1350
01:53:47,695 --> 01:53:49,448
- Come on. Come on.
- Let's go. Let's go.

1351
01:54:20,770 --> 01:54:22,439
Come on. Come on.

1352
01:55:32,259 --> 01:55:33,719
Go on. Get!

1353
01:55:34,886 --> 01:55:35,887
Yuck.

1354
01:55:35,970 --> 01:55:37,847
Hey.

1355
01:55:37,930 --> 01:55:39,224
Oh, my God.

1356
01:55:40,225 --> 01:55:41,935
I thought you were dead.

1357
01:55:42,019 --> 01:55:43,270
What do they even eat?

1358
01:55:48,442 --> 01:55:49,650
We better get inside.

1359
01:56:10,130 --> 01:56:11,256
Go ahead.

1360
01:56:50,671 --> 01:56:53,006
<i>Containment chamber compromised.</i>

1361
01:57:08,896 --> 01:57:10,023
It's locked.

1362
01:57:10,106 --> 01:57:12,400
Gonna need something heavy,
something sharp, or both.

1363
01:57:24,203 --> 01:57:26,664
That can't be right.

1364
01:57:38,426 --> 01:57:39,970
- Is that...
- Oh, no.

1365
01:57:40,761 --> 01:57:42,264
Oh, my God.

1366
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:46,225
He's burning the evidence.

1367
01:57:47,185 --> 01:57:50,439
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my...
- That's bananas.

1368
01:58:06,622 --> 01:58:09,373
Oh, my God.

1369
01:58:09,457 --> 01:58:14,378
I... I know that
this may seem precarious, but...

1370
01:58:15,546 --> 01:58:16,672
No, we're teetering.

1371
01:58:19,510 --> 01:58:21,595
Shouldn't we all lean
to the left or something?

1372
01:58:21,677 --> 01:58:23,846
That's a very constructive...
Thank you, Maisie.

1373
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:25,349
Yeah.

1374
01:58:25,431 --> 01:58:27,266
Slow. Slow.

1375
01:58:29,603 --> 01:58:30,604
Slow.

1376
01:58:32,980 --> 01:58:34,733
Yay.

1377
01:58:34,815 --> 01:58:37,402
- We're fine. See this?
- Mm-hmm.

1378
01:58:38,569 --> 01:58:39,570
- This is fine.
- Mm-hmm.

1379
01:58:53,668 --> 01:58:54,962
Alan?

1380
01:58:55,045 --> 01:58:57,338
Alan!

1381
01:58:57,421 --> 01:58:58,422
How is everybody?

1382
01:59:08,225 --> 01:59:10,351
It's my parents.

1383
01:59:11,603 --> 01:59:12,979
Help!

1384
01:59:13,564 --> 01:59:15,189
- Help!
- Listen.

1385
01:59:15,815 --> 01:59:17,067
Help!

1386
01:59:19,027 --> 01:59:20,028
Oh, God.

1387
01:59:23,573 --> 01:59:24,574
Oh, my God.

1388
01:59:25,367 --> 01:59:26,618
You're okay.

1389
01:59:27,743 --> 01:59:29,121
You're okay.

1390
01:59:29,203 --> 01:59:31,957
You came to get me. You actually...
You came to get me.

1391
01:59:32,039 --> 01:59:34,292
Of course we did, sweetheart.

1392
01:59:34,376 --> 01:59:35,877
- Hey.
- Of course.

1393
01:59:38,296 --> 01:59:39,381
I remember you.

1394
01:59:41,382 --> 01:59:43,051
Remember you too.

1395
01:59:53,145 --> 01:59:54,729
They helped me escape.

1396
01:59:55,479 --> 01:59:56,480
Yeah?

1397
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:01,194
You okay?

1398
02:00:04,488 --> 02:00:05,948
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1399
02:00:08,577 --> 02:00:09,869
We gotta go.

1400
02:00:10,621 --> 02:00:12,956
Gonna have to break a window
to get inside that thing.

1401
02:00:14,123 --> 02:00:15,751
Hope nobody is afraid of heights.

1402
02:00:28,805 --> 02:00:30,390
- Don't move.
- Don't move.

1403
02:00:49,033 --> 02:00:50,202
What is that?

1404
02:00:50,993 --> 02:00:52,287
Giganotosaurus.

1405
02:00:54,622 --> 02:00:56,792
Biggest carnivore the world has ever seen.

1406
02:01:16,060 --> 02:01:17,979
Maisie, Maisie.
Look at me. Look at me.

1407
02:01:41,627 --> 02:01:42,628
Go.

1408
02:01:58,228 --> 02:01:59,938
- Go, go, go.
- Come on!

1409
02:02:06,069 --> 02:02:07,069
No! No, no, no.

1410
02:02:11,533 --> 02:02:13,577
- Hustle!
- I'm gonna die!

1411
02:02:13,659 --> 02:02:14,994
- Climb! Climb, kid!
- No!

1412
02:02:15,078 --> 02:02:17,122
You're not. No, you're not.
You're okay.

1413
02:02:26,172 --> 02:02:27,173
Go, go, go.

1414
02:02:45,065 --> 02:02:46,318
Come on.

1415
02:02:47,569 --> 02:02:48,569
Hey!

1416
02:02:55,659 --> 02:02:57,328
Oh, yeah. Come here.

1417
02:03:14,136 --> 02:03:15,305
Help me open it.

1418
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:22,729
I got ya.

1419
02:03:23,604 --> 02:03:25,356
Go, go, go.

1420
02:03:25,439 --> 02:03:26,440
Go, go, go!

1421
02:03:29,569 --> 02:03:30,569
Run!

1422
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:49,088
See? Not so bad.

1423
02:03:55,720 --> 02:03:56,720
Come on.

1424
02:03:57,805 --> 02:03:59,474
- Owen!
- Claire!

1425
02:04:43,059 --> 02:04:46,104
Call an evacuation.
We need to bring the animals inside.

1426
02:04:46,186 --> 02:04:48,814
The regulations are clear
that in the event of a level two...

1427
02:04:48,899 --> 02:04:50,317
Shh!

1428
02:04:52,027 --> 02:04:53,028
Jeffrey.

1429
02:04:58,742 --> 02:04:59,743
God...

1430
02:05:00,493 --> 02:05:01,493
Damn it!

1431
02:05:04,079 --> 02:05:05,081
Just...

1432
02:05:06,498 --> 02:05:08,376
Just call it.

1433
02:05:08,460 --> 02:05:12,046
Attention, attention.
This is an immediate evacuation order.

1434
02:05:12,130 --> 02:05:14,256
Remote herding system
is now active.

1435
02:05:14,341 --> 02:05:17,594
All living assets en route
to emergency containment.

1436
02:05:40,492 --> 02:05:44,412
I can't get hold of anybody
since everything is on fire.

1437
02:05:45,079 --> 02:05:47,498
- Dr. Sattler, get some water.
- Oh, thanks.

1438
02:05:47,582 --> 02:05:49,708
Dr. Grant?
Here you are.

1439
02:05:49,792 --> 02:05:52,712
I'm Owen Grady.
Big fan. I read your book.

1440
02:05:53,337 --> 02:05:54,756
Well, book on tape.

1441
02:05:54,838 --> 02:05:58,551
Owen Grady. Owen Grady.
Yeah, I know who you are.

1442
02:05:59,469 --> 02:06:01,304
You trained raptors.

1443
02:06:01,387 --> 02:06:04,390
I tried. Yeah.

1444
02:06:04,474 --> 02:06:06,559
- How you doing?
- The one here.

1445
02:06:07,644 --> 02:06:09,479
You were at Jurassic World.

1446
02:06:10,063 --> 02:06:13,774
Jurassic World? Not a fan.
Mm-mmm.

1447
02:06:14,609 --> 02:06:17,695
Okay.
So, we good to find a way out of here?

1448
02:06:17,779 --> 02:06:20,073
- Yep.
- Let's get it.

1449
02:06:20,155 --> 02:06:23,409
There's a helicopter
out in the main complex.

1450
02:06:23,493 --> 02:06:26,162
We turn the ADS back on, we go home.

1451
02:06:26,246 --> 02:06:28,707
- Wait. What's an ADS?
- Aerial Deterrent System.

1452
02:06:30,332 --> 02:06:32,752
You know?
For the pterodactyls and shit.

1453
02:06:32,836 --> 02:06:34,628
Keeps them away from the helicopters.

1454
02:06:34,712 --> 02:06:36,381
Well, how do we turn it back on?

1455
02:06:36,463 --> 02:06:39,551
It looks like all the systems
run through to the control room,

1456
02:06:39,634 --> 02:06:40,885
which is on the third floor.

1457
02:06:42,302 --> 02:06:44,514
These outposts
are all connected underground.

1458
02:06:50,185 --> 02:06:51,854
All right. Easy, Rambo.

1459
02:07:02,073 --> 02:07:03,949
So you worked
in the raptor pen, huh?

1460
02:07:04,868 --> 02:07:06,411
Yeah.

1461
02:07:06,493 --> 02:07:07,578
Wow. And what happens?

1462
02:07:07,662 --> 02:07:10,914
Do you just tell them what to do
and they comply? Or...

1463
02:07:12,125 --> 02:07:15,837
Well, it's a human-animal bond
based on mutual respect.

1464
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:17,380
Mm-hmm.

1465
02:07:18,465 --> 02:07:20,591
I had a dog once.

1466
02:07:20,675 --> 02:07:25,345
Humped my leg so much
I got a callus on my shinbone.

1467
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:26,680
That's a true story.

1468
02:07:42,447 --> 02:07:44,823
Oh, God. Hey. Good.

1469
02:07:47,077 --> 02:07:49,787
Here's what I'm thinking.
We get started again.

1470
02:07:49,871 --> 02:07:51,872
You and me.
I can get money.

1471
02:07:53,457 --> 02:07:55,835
Yeah. Money's cheap these days.

1472
02:07:55,918 --> 02:07:58,962
Wh-What's the matter?
Don't look so worried. There's...

1473
02:07:59,046 --> 02:08:03,259
There's opportunity in everything.
E-Even this. You'll learn that.

1474
02:08:04,010 --> 02:08:07,846
I've been thinking,
maybe you take more of a lead now. Okay?

1475
02:08:08,722 --> 02:08:09,807
You're ready, I think.

1476
02:08:10,350 --> 02:08:11,350
Here, take...

1477
02:08:11,975 --> 02:08:13,645
What the hell
is the matter with you?

1478
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:24,279
It was you.

1479
02:08:25,073 --> 02:08:27,617
You told Malcolm
about the program. Y-You...

1480
02:08:28,618 --> 02:08:31,371
You set this whole thing up.
You set me up.

1481
02:08:32,287 --> 02:08:34,666
I gave you every opportunity
I did not have. I...

1482
02:08:36,125 --> 02:08:40,755
We have an understanding, Ramsay.
And you do not break that.

1483
02:08:43,550 --> 02:08:45,176
I would not break this.

1484
02:08:48,512 --> 02:08:49,847
I'm not you.

1485
02:09:02,609 --> 02:09:03,987
Uh-oh.

1486
02:09:05,029 --> 02:09:06,655
This is very bad.

1487
02:09:08,490 --> 02:09:10,493
This is the same system
we used at the park.

1488
02:09:10,577 --> 02:09:15,372
Great. So we can turn on the thing
and then we all get out of here?

1489
02:09:15,456 --> 02:09:17,250
Let's see. ADS...

1490
02:09:18,417 --> 02:09:20,377
What's this? What's "Error 99"?

1491
02:09:20,461 --> 02:09:22,380
Not enough power.

1492
02:09:22,462 --> 02:09:24,256
In a breakdown,
all available power is seized

1493
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:26,509
by the primary system to keep running.

1494
02:09:26,592 --> 02:09:28,761
We need all that power
to reactivate the ADS.

1495
02:09:28,845 --> 02:09:30,889
The system's safety feature
is what's gonna kill us?

1496
02:09:30,971 --> 02:09:32,265
Of course.

1497
02:09:32,347 --> 02:09:34,182
- How do we get more power?
- We can't.

1498
02:09:34,266 --> 02:09:36,101
But we can redistribute what we have.

1499
02:09:36,185 --> 02:09:38,104
- Just need to...
- Shut down the primary system.

1500
02:09:38,186 --> 02:09:39,396
- Yes. Exactly.
- Where is it?

1501
02:09:39,479 --> 02:09:41,608
- Uh, next floor up.
- I'm coming with you.

1502
02:09:41,690 --> 02:09:43,109
We escaped down here.

1503
02:09:44,277 --> 02:09:47,947
- Where is that? Water treatment center?
- Hydroelectric system. Sub eight.

1504
02:09:48,030 --> 02:09:49,657
Give me eight minutes.
I could find her.

1505
02:09:49,740 --> 02:09:50,824
Wait. Who's this now?

1506
02:09:50,908 --> 02:09:52,911
Beta. Blue's baby.

1507
02:09:52,993 --> 02:09:54,494
Velociraptor.

1508
02:09:54,578 --> 02:09:56,163
- What?
- A baby raptor?

1509
02:09:56,247 --> 02:09:57,957
You gave her a name.
How about that?

1510
02:09:58,041 --> 02:09:59,833
I made a promise
we would bring her home.

1511
02:09:59,917 --> 02:10:02,795
You made a promise
to a dinosaur.

1512
02:10:02,878 --> 02:10:04,505
You're coming with us, right?

1513
02:10:04,588 --> 02:10:06,173
Maisie, I...

1514
02:10:06,256 --> 02:10:07,300
Please.

1515
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:12,555
- I'll be on channel five.
- Okay.

1516
02:10:12,639 --> 02:10:14,640
We're on three.

1517
02:10:15,265 --> 02:10:16,266
Come back.

1518
02:10:17,185 --> 02:10:18,519
I always come back.

1519
02:10:19,645 --> 02:10:22,439
I'll have that chopper hot in ten.
Wait for my signal.

1520
02:10:24,567 --> 02:10:26,903
<i>Evacuation phase four complete.</i>

1521
02:10:26,985 --> 02:10:28,988
<i>All living assets now in containment.</i>

1522
02:10:37,997 --> 02:10:38,997
Come on.

1523
02:10:51,551 --> 02:10:53,011
Still get nightmares?

1524
02:10:53,595 --> 02:10:54,596
All the time.

1525
02:10:55,640 --> 02:10:56,640
You?

1526
02:10:58,016 --> 02:10:59,935
I have a lot of regrets.

1527
02:11:00,019 --> 02:11:01,020
Oh, yeah?

1528
02:11:02,521 --> 02:11:03,523
Well,

1529
02:11:04,439 --> 02:11:07,568
we hold on to regret,
we stay in the past.

1530
02:11:11,197 --> 02:11:12,823
What matters, I guess, is...

1531
02:11:14,533 --> 02:11:15,993
Is what we do now.

1532
02:11:16,618 --> 02:11:18,453
- Right?
- Yeah.

1533
02:11:24,585 --> 02:11:27,462
Ah.

1534
02:11:31,259 --> 02:11:32,551
Okay.

1535
02:11:35,887 --> 02:11:37,849
Nobody said there'd be bugs.

1536
02:11:40,100 --> 02:11:42,060
B4. She's in here.

1537
02:11:42,936 --> 02:11:46,606
Watch the sides.
They always come from the sides.

1538
02:11:48,775 --> 02:11:54,573
You know, at first we thought
they disembowel their prey, but no.

1539
02:11:55,783 --> 02:11:58,202
They're smart enough
to go straight for the throat.

1540
02:11:59,287 --> 02:12:00,747
The veins, the arteries.

1541
02:12:02,039 --> 02:12:04,167
Sometimes both at the same time.

1542
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:05,376
Okay.

1543
02:12:07,127 --> 02:12:08,378
Okay.

1544
02:12:08,462 --> 02:12:10,381
<i>We've got you.
It's right down that aisle.</i>

1545
02:12:10,465 --> 02:12:13,265
<i>It's right down that aisle where you are.</i>

1546
02:12:13,301 --> 02:12:14,635
<i>Why are they skulking in...</i>

1547
02:12:14,719 --> 02:12:15,886
You can sprint right for it.

1548
02:12:15,970 --> 02:12:18,389
Okay. Here it is.

1549
02:12:18,472 --> 02:12:20,557
Okay, it'll be a yellow button
on a grid of six.

1550
02:12:20,640 --> 02:12:23,435
<i>There's a green button.
Do you see a green button?</i>

1551
02:12:23,519 --> 02:12:25,270
<i>It's not that green button.</i>

1552
02:12:25,354 --> 02:12:27,398
It's four from the bottom.
Above this...

1553
02:12:27,481 --> 02:12:28,899
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Fourth one up?

1554
02:12:28,983 --> 02:12:30,703
Third one down or fourth one up.
Same thing.

1555
02:12:30,777 --> 02:12:32,028
Ian, be specific.

1556
02:12:37,283 --> 02:12:38,533
She was here.

1557
02:12:39,118 --> 02:12:40,286
Lights off.

1558
02:12:46,833 --> 02:12:48,920
I don't know how I could possibly
be more specific

1559
02:12:49,002 --> 02:12:51,756
other than to say
that the one you want is marked

1560
02:12:51,838 --> 02:12:53,507
- with "E1." E1.
- E1.

1561
02:12:55,635 --> 02:12:56,636
E1.

1562
02:12:57,386 --> 02:12:58,970
Yeah.

1563
02:13:03,518 --> 02:13:05,685
No. No, no, no, no.

1564
02:13:12,318 --> 02:13:14,278
Damn it. She's fast.

1565
02:13:16,863 --> 02:13:17,863
Hey!

1566
02:13:19,033 --> 02:13:20,451
Eyes on me.

1567
02:13:24,956 --> 02:13:27,250
I've got to hit her
on the side of her neck.

1568
02:13:27,332 --> 02:13:28,960
Maisie,
you're gonna hold her focus.

1569
02:13:29,585 --> 02:13:30,586
Grant,

1570
02:13:31,253 --> 02:13:32,380
we're triangulating.

1571
02:13:38,344 --> 02:13:39,386
Go.

1572
02:14:08,748 --> 02:14:09,750
Sorry, girl.

1573
02:14:10,877 --> 02:14:12,837
I promised your mom
I'd get you home.

1574
02:14:14,171 --> 02:14:16,173
<i>Primary system rebooting.</i>

1575
02:14:16,256 --> 02:14:18,341
Wait. Oh, no, no, no.

1576
02:14:18,426 --> 02:14:19,760
- No, no, no.
- It's rebooting.

1577
02:14:19,844 --> 02:14:20,970
It shouldn't be doing that.

1578
02:14:32,856 --> 02:14:33,858
Here, take this.

1579
02:14:50,416 --> 02:14:51,894
- Gonna stay on it.
<i>- Shut it down!</i>

1580
02:14:51,917 --> 02:14:54,229
We're gonna make it work.
We're gonna figure this out. It's complex.

1581
02:14:54,252 --> 02:14:56,213
We don't have time for complex!

1582
02:15:01,510 --> 02:15:03,386
<i>Primary system compromised.</i>

1583
02:15:05,722 --> 02:15:07,140
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1584
02:15:07,225 --> 02:15:09,118
<i>Aerial Deterrent System active.</i>

1585
02:15:09,143 --> 02:15:10,228
Victory. Victory.

1586
02:15:14,105 --> 02:15:15,565
Damn, that felt good.

1587
02:15:44,052 --> 02:15:45,554
Oh! Come on!

1588
02:16:38,316 --> 02:16:39,524
What's your story?

1589
02:16:43,069 --> 02:16:44,070
Wait!

1590
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:57,501
<i>At Biosyn, we're dedicated to the idea</i>

1591
02:16:57,584 --> 02:17:01,547
<i>that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves.</i>

1592
02:17:06,260 --> 02:17:08,554
<i>All right, Kayla. We're good to go.</i>

1593
02:17:19,105 --> 02:17:20,231
Okay, cutie.

1594
02:17:27,031 --> 02:17:28,031
Come here.

1595
02:17:29,492 --> 02:17:30,492
You all right?

1596
02:17:30,533 --> 02:17:31,534
- Someday.
- Okay.

1597
02:17:31,619 --> 02:17:32,787
Hey.

1598
02:17:40,835 --> 02:17:42,046
I remember you.

1599
02:17:42,671 --> 02:17:44,255
Please. You have to listen to me.

1600
02:17:44,340 --> 02:17:46,217
You created an ecological disaster.

1601
02:17:46,299 --> 02:17:47,718
And I can fix it.

1602
02:17:48,426 --> 02:17:51,638
Charlotte Lockwood changed every cell
in Maisie's body.

1603
02:17:52,722 --> 02:17:54,225
It saved her life.

1604
02:17:54,308 --> 02:17:57,770
If I can understand
how Charlotte rewrote Maisie's DNA,

1605
02:17:57,852 --> 02:18:01,022
I can spread change from one locust
to the entire swarm.

1606
02:18:01,106 --> 02:18:02,941
Before it's too late.

1607
02:18:04,943 --> 02:18:05,944
It's okay.

1608
02:18:06,736 --> 02:18:07,737
It's okay.

1609
02:18:11,157 --> 02:18:12,993
It's what she would've wanted.

1610
02:18:15,995 --> 02:18:16,996
Thank you.

1611
02:18:17,081 --> 02:18:18,082
No, no, no.

1612
02:18:19,165 --> 02:18:20,959
No, no, no, no, no.

1613
02:18:21,835 --> 02:18:22,836
Him?

1614
02:18:23,336 --> 02:18:25,840
Not him. Not him.
It's always him.

1615
02:18:25,923 --> 02:18:26,924
Every si...

1616
02:18:28,509 --> 02:18:30,261
Is that a dinosaur
on your shoulder?

1617
02:18:31,262 --> 02:18:32,430
Yeah. Why?

1618
02:18:34,139 --> 02:18:36,183
<i>I have air. Meet me at the center.</i>

1619
02:18:36,266 --> 02:18:39,895
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Hey, hey. Do not land in here.

1620
02:18:39,978 --> 02:18:42,022
I don't have a choice, dude.
The valley isn't safe.

1621
02:18:42,105 --> 02:18:43,691
No, they're not in the valley anymore!

1622
02:18:43,773 --> 02:18:45,860
Oh!

1623
02:20:16,115 --> 02:20:17,200
This isn't about us.

1624
02:20:22,206 --> 02:20:23,207
Go! Go!

1625
02:20:43,852 --> 02:20:44,852
Come on!

1626
02:20:48,648 --> 02:20:51,277
Oh, my God! Get him up!
Come on, come on!

1627
02:20:51,360 --> 02:20:53,361
Come on.

1628
02:20:55,531 --> 02:20:56,949
Come on, come on, come on!

1629
02:21:01,537 --> 02:21:02,538
Come on!

1630
02:21:17,051 --> 02:21:18,051
Ellie, no!

1631
02:21:47,540 --> 02:21:48,959
Come on, Maisie! Go!

1632
02:21:51,045 --> 02:21:52,337
Ramsay, get in.

1633
02:21:52,421 --> 02:21:54,173
Come on, come on, come on.

1634
02:21:58,676 --> 02:22:00,595
Everybody hold on to somebody.

1635
02:23:21,801 --> 02:23:22,844
Ow.

1636
02:23:25,055 --> 02:23:26,724
No, at every level.

1637
02:23:26,807 --> 02:23:29,393
Complete systemic corruption
in the executive ranks.

1638
02:23:29,476 --> 02:23:32,478
"Systemic corruption." You get that?
Write that down.

1639
02:23:32,563 --> 02:23:34,856
Yeah, it's crazy.

1640
02:23:34,940 --> 02:23:38,192
And then... And then we crashed
into this ice lake, right?

1641
02:23:38,277 --> 02:23:40,279
I mean,
they literally owe me a plane.

1642
02:23:40,361 --> 02:23:43,156
I need to get this sample vetted
at the lab

1643
02:23:43,239 --> 02:23:45,367
before I take it to my contact
at the <i>Times.</i>

1644
02:23:47,702 --> 02:23:49,913
You could, uh, come with me.

1645
02:23:51,582 --> 02:23:54,001
Unless you need
to get back to your dig.

1646
02:23:57,004 --> 02:23:58,504
- Ellie?
- Yeah?

1647
02:24:01,174 --> 02:24:02,885
I am coming with you.

1648
02:24:14,021 --> 02:24:17,398
I know. One more minute,
then we'll send you home with your folks.

1649
02:24:57,064 --> 02:24:59,148
<i>Today marks the first day of testimony</i>

1650
02:24:59,233 --> 02:25:01,485
<i>from Biosyn whistleblower Ramsay Cole.</i>

1651
02:25:01,567 --> 02:25:05,447
<i>The Senate will also hear from
Doctors Grant, Sattler and Malcolm,</i>

1652
02:25:05,531 --> 02:25:09,200
<i>who have been vocal in this debate
since the incident at Jurassic Park.</i>

1653
02:25:11,828 --> 02:25:13,038
You look...

1654
02:25:13,579 --> 02:25:15,122
- Uncomfortable.
- ...trustworthy.

1655
02:25:20,420 --> 02:25:22,630
Yeah, not getting used to it.

1656
02:25:25,092 --> 02:25:26,093
Let's finish this.

1657
02:25:27,051 --> 02:25:28,052
Yeah.

1658
02:25:32,265 --> 02:25:35,018
<i>Dr. Henry Wu
has found an emergency solution</i>

1659
02:25:35,102 --> 02:25:37,061
<i>to the ecological crisis.</i>

1660
02:25:37,145 --> 02:25:40,315
<i>His use of a pathogen

1661
02:25:40,398 --> 02:25:42,692
<i>has revolutionized modern genetics.</i>

1662

<i>He attributed the discovery

1663
02:25:47,406 --> 02:25:49,907
<i>who died nearly 13 years ago.</i>

1664
02:26:17,394 --> 02:26:22,608
<i>By UN decree, Biosyn valley

1665
02:26:22,691 --> 02:26:26,444
<i>The animals will live there free,

1666
02:26:31,115 --> 02:26:32,909
- Money?
- Money.

1667
02:26:32,993 --> 02:26:33,994
Thank you.

1668
02:28:37,743 --> 02:28:41,579
Life on Earth has existed
for hundreds of millions of years.

1669
02:28:42,664 --> 02:28:45,375
And dinosaurs were only a part of that.

1670
02:28:45,459 --> 02:28:47,418
And we're an even smaller part of that.

1671
02:28:48,128 --> 02:28:50,297
They really put us in perspective.

1672
02:28:52,424 --> 02:28:55,801
<i>The idea that life on Earth
existed 65 million years ago...</i>

1673
02:28:57,470 --> 02:28:58,471
it's humbling.

1674
02:29:00,097 --> 02:29:02,516
We act like we're alone here,
but we're not.

1675
02:29:03,393 --> 02:29:06,313
<i>We're part of a fragile system
made up of all living things.</i>

1676
02:29:07,605 --> 02:29:10,399
<i>If we're going to survive,
we'll have to trust each other.</i>

1677
02:29:11,525 --> 02:29:12,818
<i>Depend on each other.</i>

1678
02:29:13,779 --> 02:29:15,530
Coexist.
