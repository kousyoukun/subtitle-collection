1
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,030
把它带过来!
Bring it in!

2
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:24,985
恐龙在我们的世界里。
Dinosaurs are in our world.

3
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,922
每一次对抗，我们都能更多地了解这个可怕的新现实。
And with every confrontation, we learn more about this frightening new reality.

4
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:33,232
.．.我们是怎么走到这一步的?
...How did we get here?

5
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:34,826
.．.哦,我的上帝。
...Oh, my God.

6
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:42,404
侏罗纪公园的致命事件已经过去三十年了，我们还没有找到让这些动物安全地生活在我们身边的方法。
It's been three decades since the deadly events at Jurassic Park, and we've yet to find a way for these animals to live safely among us.

7
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:49,513
努布拉尔岛长期休眠的火山毁灭性地爆发后，那些幸存者被运送到大陆。
After the devastating eruption of Isla Nublar's long-dormant volcano, those who survived were transported to the mainland.

8
00:01:49,648 --> 00:01:57,121
许多大型食肉动物被捕获，但剩下的动物分散在大岩石国家公园。
Many of the larger predators were captured, but the remaining creatures scattered here in Big Rock National Park.

9
00:01:57,256 --> 00:02:03,554
大多数人留在野外，而那些进入文明社会的人则在努力适应陌生的环境。
While most remained in the wild, those who made their way to civilization struggled to adapt to unfamiliar conditions.

10
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:10,468
当地政府警告说，这些动物是不可预测的，当饥饿时，它们会非常暴力。
Local authorities have warned the animals are unpredictable and, when hungry, extremely violent.

11
00:02:10,603 --> 00:02:15,482
随着恐龙跨越国界传播，一个全球黑市已经上升....他们不是我们的。
As the dinosaurs spread across borders, a global black market has risen.... They're not ours.

12
00:02:15,506 --> 00:02:18,370
继续，你这个可悲的，可悲的失败者!
Go on, you sad, pathetic loser!

13
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:27,044
为了打击日益严重的非法偷猎者威胁，美国国会授予全球巨头Biosyn Genetics公司独家采集权。
To combat the growing threat of illegal poachers, the U. S. Congress awarded sole collection rights to the global giant Biosyn Genetics.

14
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,888
在Biosyn，我们致力于这样一个想法:恐龙可以让我们更多地了解自己。
At Biosyn, we're dedicated to the idea that dinosaurs can teach us more about ourselves.

15
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:45,162
首席执行官刘易斯·道奇森在意大利的白云石山脉建立了一个保护区，他希望在那里研究恐龙古老的免疫系统，以获得独特的药物特性。
CEO Lewis Dodgson has created a sanctuary in Italy's Dolomite Mountains, where he hopes to study the dinosaurs' ancient immune systems for unique pharmaceutical properties.

16
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:50,434
虽然Biosyn相信我们可以负责任地处理遗传能力，但公众仍然持怀疑态度。
While Biosyn believes we can handle genetic power responsibly, the public remains skeptical.

17
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:56,248
一些人指出，这些政府合同导致了Biosyn公司利润的大幅飙升。
Some note that these government contracts have led to massive spikes in Biosyn's profits.

18
00:02:56,383 --> 00:03:02,587
关于一个克隆人神秘失踪的谣言一直存在，这引发了全球范围内的搜索。
And rumors persist of a human clone who mysteriously disappeared, leading to a worldwide search.

19
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:09,927
有人认为她和夏洛特·洛克伍德基因相同，夏洛特是侏罗纪公园联合创始人本杰明·洛克伍德已故的女儿。
Some believe she's genetically identical to Charlotte Lockwood, deceased daughter of Jurassic Park cofounder Benjamin Lockwood.

20
00:03:10,062 --> 00:03:13,058
既然我们把这些濒临灭绝的动物救了回来……
Now that we've brought these animals back from extinction...

21
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,833
我们要对它们负责吗?
Are we responsible for them?

22
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:19,932
还是应该让他们自生自灭?
Or should they be left to fend for themselves?

23
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:28,845
随着我们适应这个不断变化的世界，我们必须找到这些问题的答案。为了他们和我们自己的安全。
As we adapt to an ever-changing world, we must find answers to these questions... For their safety as well as for our own.

24
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:13,823
我们在非法繁殖基地里。
We are inside the illegal breeding facility.

25
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:17,896
为了降低成本，幼鱼被关在笼子里。
The juveniles are kept in cages to keep costs down.

26
00:04:18,032 --> 00:04:20,230
这是中世纪。
It's medieval.

27
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,504
克莱尔。
Claire.

28
00:04:29,908 --> 00:04:32,137
你觉得他为什么会和其他人分开?
Why do you think he's separated from the rest?

29
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,647
我觉得他撑不过来了。
I don't think he's gonna make it.

30
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,021
不。你在干什么?
No. What are you doing?

31
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,389
我们可以报道。
We can report this.

32
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:46,960
DFW花了几天时间进行调查。
The DFW takes days to investigate.

33
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:49,455
我们现在就可以拯救它。
We can save this one now.

34
00:04:50,993 --> 00:04:52,157
没关系。没事的,朋友。
It's okay. It's okay, buddy.

35
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,997
好吧。我们开始吧。
Okay. Here we go.

36
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:03,539
不。不!
Nope. No!

37
00:05:03,675 --> 00:05:05,706
电梯……。
...Lift.

38
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:07,704
-支撑头部。-是的。
- Support the head. - Yeah.

39
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,249
好吧。是的。
Okay. Yeah.

40
00:05:13,455 --> 00:05:14,887
好吧,来吧。来吧，我们走。
Okay, come on. Come on, let's go.

41
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:22,055
——坚持。——什么?
- Hold on. - To what?

42
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,320
克莱尔，我们要中枪了!
Claire, we're gonna get shot!

43
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:55,754
——没有。克莱尔,不!不,克莱尔!——哦,天哪!
- No. Claire, no! No, Claire! - Oh, no!

44
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:06,803
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

45
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,773
每个人都好吗?
Everybody good?

46
00:06:11,908 --> 00:06:13,645
…不!
...No!

47
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,222
好吧。好吧，我想我们把这个送到DFW，然后再袭击他们一次。
Okay. Okay, so I think we get this one to the DFW, and then we hit them again.

48
00:06:29,357 --> 00:06:31,865
是的。是啊，你看到繁殖地了吧?
Yeah. Yeah, you saw that breeding ground, right?

49
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,665
我们做完了。
We're done.

50
00:06:35,698 --> 00:06:36,903
上周我接到一个电话。
I got a call last week.

51
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:38,561
这是一份真正的工作。
It's a real job.

52
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,736
这样我就能有效地改变现状。
Something I could do to effectively change things.

53
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:42,973
-我得接电话-他们需要我们。
- I got to take it. - They need us.

54
00:06:43,108 --> 00:06:47,294
你拯救这些恐龙是因为它们需要我们，还是说它们是为了给你自己开脱?
Are you saving these dinosaurs because they need us, or are you saying them to absolve yourself?

55
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:48,841
克莱尔。
...Claire.

56
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:52,515
这太疯狂了。我们……克莱尔。
I mean, this is crazy. We... Claire.

57
00:06:52,651 --> 00:06:54,346
你这么做是对的。
You're doing the right thing.

58
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:57,381
但这…这已经不是解决问题的方法了。
But this... this isn't the way to go about it anymore.

59
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,992
说实话，你需要一个擅长被枪击的人。
Honestly, you need someone who's good at being shot at.

60
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:05,262
你和欧文是不是还是很奇怪?
Aren't-aren't you and Owen still, like, a weird thing?

61
00:07:05,398 --> 00:07:06,828
没那么奇怪。
It's not that weird.

62
00:07:06,963 --> 00:07:09,368
-他不是说奇怪。不。
- He didn't mean weird. No. - Mm-mm.

63
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:11,901
他的意思是，惊喜。
Uh, he meant, like, surprising.

64
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,692
Hyah !
Hyah!

65
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:53,074
让我们把他们带回家!Hyah !
Let's bring 'em home! Hyah!

66
00:08:14,234 --> 00:08:16,262
Hyah !
Hyah!

67
00:08:42,327 --> 00:08:44,158
不。
No.

68
00:08:56,606 --> 00:08:58,337
好吧。到这里来。
Okay. Come here.

69
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,947
好吧。
Okay.

70
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,698
我们会带你去安全的地方。
We're gonna get you someplace safe.

71
00:09:22,268 --> 00:09:23,802
嘿。
Hey.

72
00:09:27,706 --> 00:09:30,776
那就这样吧。那就这样吧。
There you go. There you go.

73
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,141
是的。
Yeah.

74
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:31,825
嘿。
Hey.

75
00:12:33,856 --> 00:12:35,490
你在哪里?
Where you been?

76
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:36,726
没有。
Nowhere.

77
00:12:36,861 --> 00:12:39,193
你在烧什么?
What are you burning?

78
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:42,561
哦,没什么。只是一些旧毯子。
Oh, nothing. Just some old blankets.

79
00:12:44,401 --> 00:12:46,171
你确定你没经过桥吗?
You sure you didn't go past the bridge?

80
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,311
当你认为我在撒谎时，你就会这样看我。
That's the look you give me when you think I'm lying.

81
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,405
-是吗?——没有。
- Well, are you? - No.

82
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,615
梅奇，你到处都找不到这里。
Maisie, you're literally looking everywhere but here.

83
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,848
我说了我没过桥。
I said I didn't go past the bridge.

84
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:00,512
梅齐。
Maisie.

85
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,781
-我们能重新开始吗?-我知道，克莱尔
- Can we start over? - I know, Claire.

86
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,699
外面有人会不惜一切找到我。
There are people out there who'll do anything to find me.

87
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:06,255
我不生气。
I'm not angry.

88
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,085
也就是说你不需要生气。
So that means you don't have to be angry.

89
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,627
我不生气。
I'm not angry.

90
00:13:09,763 --> 00:13:11,254
我能照顾好自己。
I can take care of myself.

91
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:12,930
嘿。
Hey.

92
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:15,402
我们可以互相依赖。
It's okay for us to depend on each other.

93
00:13:15,537 --> 00:13:17,394
人们就是这么做的。
That's what people do.

94
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:19,567
我怎么知道别人会做什么?
How would I know what people do?

95
00:13:19,702 --> 00:13:24,636
过去四年里我只跟你们俩说过话。
The only people I've spoken to in the past four years are you both.

96
00:13:24,772 --> 00:13:27,609
再说，我也不是真人。
Besides, I'm not even a real person anyway.

97
00:13:27,744 --> 00:13:28,744
什么?
What?

98
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,976
我是由别人造出来的。
I was made from someone else.

99
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,383
我不是我。
I'm not me.

100
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,094
你是唯一曾经是你的人。
You're the only you who ever was.

101
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:45,661
什么?
What?

102
00:13:45,797 --> 00:13:47,325
不。
No.

103
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:48,895
那真的很老套吗?
Was that, like, really corny?

104
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,130
太老套了。
It was so corny.

105
00:13:50,265 --> 00:13:51,470
我们能保守这个秘密吗?
Can we keep that between us?

106
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:52,934
不能保证。
Can't promise that.

107
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,006
嘿,小子。-嗨。
- Hey, kid. - Hi.

108
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:02,480
对不起,我迟到了。
Sorry I'm late.

109
00:14:02,615 --> 00:14:03,976
防喷器、防喷器。
Bop, bop.

110
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,320
哦。
Aw.

111
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,750
你闻起来像马。
You smell like horses.

112
00:14:09,086 --> 00:14:10,347
哦，你喜欢那样，是吗?
Oh, you like that, do you?

113
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:11,589
-是的。——哦。
- I do, yeah. - Aw.

114
00:14:11,724 --> 00:14:12,724
好吧。
Okay.

115
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:17,026
嗯…我要…做晚餐。
Um... I'm gonna... make dinner.

116
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:18,826
一切都好吗?
Everything okay?

117
00:14:20,295 --> 00:14:22,331
她又去了城里。
She went into town again.

118
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:25,328
这个孩子。
This kid.

119
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,173
你和她说话了吗?
Did you talk to her?

120
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:29,199
我试过了。
I tried.

121
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:32,269
我会跟她说的。
I'll talk to her.

122
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,073
好吧。
All right.

123
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:15,576
切断与自己的联系。
Cut away from yourself.

124
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:20,883
哇。
Whoa.

125
00:16:21,018 --> 00:16:22,083
唷。
Whew.

126
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:24,154
——冰冷如石的。——对吗?
- Stone-cold. - Right?

127
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,921
我不会惹她的。
I would not mess with her.

128
00:16:26,056 --> 00:16:27,625
不可能。
No way.

129
00:16:33,463 --> 00:16:35,843
听着，孩子，我们应该谈谈你进城的事。
Listen, kiddo, we should probably talk about you going into town.

130
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:39,717
我想你不明白被困在这里有多糟糕。
I don't think you understand how bad it is being trapped here.

131
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:41,301
你没有被困在这里。
You're not trapped here.

132
00:16:41,436 --> 00:16:42,808
我们就是不相信别人。
We just don't trust people.

133
00:16:42,943 --> 00:16:44,307
不，你只是不相信我。
No, you just don't trust me.

134
00:16:44,442 --> 00:16:46,839
你还指望我相信你。
And then you expect me to trust you.

135
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:49,412
-为什么我不能有自由?-因为你不能。
- Why can't I have any freedom? - Because you can't.

136
00:16:54,545 --> 00:16:56,589
那就好了。
That went great.

137
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,256
发生了什么?
What is happening?

138
00:16:59,256 --> 00:17:01,156
——她是14。-是的。
- She's 14. - Yeah.

139
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,228
你还记得那是什么感觉吧。
You remember what that was like.

140
00:17:04,226 --> 00:17:05,824
我做的事。
I do.

141
00:17:06,968 --> 00:17:08,801
我们不能永远把她关在这里。
We can't keep her here forever.

142
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:12,436
如果我们不解决这个问题，她会去比桥更远的地方。
If we don't figure this out, she's gonna go a lot farther than the bridge.

143
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:14,415
如果他们找到她，我们就再也见不到她了。
If they find her, we're never gonna see her again.

144
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,919
我们得保护她。这是我们的工作。
We got to protect her. That's our job.

145
00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:17,136
这就是我们要做的。
That's what we're gonna do.

146
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:18,810
保护她?
Protect her how?

147
00:17:18,945 --> 00:17:20,971
把她锁在里面?
By locking her inside?

148
00:17:22,017 --> 00:17:24,240
她有问题。
She's got questions.

149
00:17:25,243 --> 00:17:27,153
你知道，我们无法回答的问题。
You know, questions we can't answer.

150
00:17:29,122 --> 00:17:30,981
她想知道自己是谁。
She wants to know who she is.

151
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,690
夏洛特·洛克伍德是谁
Who Charlotte Lockwood was.

152
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,796
跟踪格雷迪到了他家。
Tracked Grady to his house.

153
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:47,998
你是对的…迅猛龙抓住了一只幼龙。
You were right... The raptor's got a juvenile.

154
00:17:49,143 --> 00:17:51,375
但听着，还有一件事。
But listen, there's something else.

155
00:17:52,378 --> 00:17:54,543
我找到你要找的那个女孩了。
I found that girl you've been after.

156
00:18:09,158 --> 00:18:10,658
给你。
Here you go.

157
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:24,462
谢谢你的到来。
Thanks for coming.

158
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:26,965
不知道该打给谁。
Wasn't sure who to call.

159
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:30,441
如果不是恐龙，鱼类和野生动物协会都不想看到它。
Fish and Wildlife didn't even want to see it if it wasn't a dinosaur.

160
00:19:30,576 --> 00:19:32,608
是啊，他们吸引了所有的注意力。
Yeah, well, they get all the attention.

161
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:35,773
你们想把取样地各改变一百码吗?
You guys want to vary the sampling plots a hundred yards each?

162
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,249
-这些是你的学生?-是的。
- These your students? - Yeah.

163
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:44,420
我们一直在研究工业化农业对环境的影响，所以这正合我们的胃口。
We've been looking into the impact of industrial farming on the environment, so this is right up our alley.

164
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:47,260
他们在县里挖了60块地。
They hit 60 fields in the county.

165
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,289
你以前见过这样的东西吗?
Have you seen anything like this before?

166
00:19:49,424 --> 00:19:51,487
不。不是这样的。
No. Not like this.

167
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:54,599
他们已经离开了整个中西部退化的土地。
They've been leaving degraded fields all across the Midwest.

168
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,967
首先，这些大公司试图杀死所有的昆虫。
First, these big companies try to kill off all the insects.

169
00:19:58,102 --> 00:19:59,965
现在这个。
Now this.

170
00:20:10,016 --> 00:20:11,449
那是你的土地吗?
Is that your land?

171
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,887
农民PERÉ-那是贝内特家的玉米。
FARMER PERÉ- That's the Bennetts' corn.

172
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,220
蝗虫不吃那个。
The locusts didn't eat that.

173
00:20:14,355 --> 00:20:16,654
你和贝内特家种下了一样的种子吗?
You plant the same seed as the Bennetts?

174
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,318
不。
No.

175
00:20:18,454 --> 00:20:20,260
我们是独立的。
We are independent.

176
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:23,527
他们使用生物合成素种子。
They use Biosyn seed.

177
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,630
是的，我打赌他们会的。
Yeah, I bet they do.

178
00:20:28,763 --> 00:20:30,560
你说你抓到了一只活的?
You say you caught a live one?

179
00:20:40,181 --> 00:20:42,315
好的。让她慢慢下来。
Okay. Let her down slow.

180
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:46,781
——好了吗?-好了 放松。
- Got it? - Yeah. Easy.

181
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:55,028
我们为什么要挖?
Why do we dig?

182
00:20:55,163 --> 00:21:02,899
因为古生物学是科学，而科学是关于真相的，而真相就在这些岩石中。
'Cause paleontology is science, and science is about the truth, and there is truth in these rocks.

183
00:21:03,034 --> 00:21:04,337
格兰特!
Grant!

184
00:21:06,735 --> 00:21:08,236
你会想看看这个的。
You're gonna want to see this.

185
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,212
艾莉解决。
Ellie Sattler.

186
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:25,682
艾伦·格兰特。
Alan Grant.

187
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,521
你们看起来一样。
You look the same.

188
00:21:27,657 --> 00:21:29,523
哦。
Oh.

189
00:21:29,658 --> 00:21:35,698
和这个地方……它是如此……所以,呃,你。
And this place... it's so... ...so, uh, you.

190
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:44,069
对不起,我……如果我知道你要来，我就会……嗯…
I'm sorry, I... If I'd known you were coming, I would've... Uh...

191
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:52,074
你要喝点什么吗?啤酒或…嗯，也许不是在凌晨1点。
Can I get you something? A beer or... Um, well, maybe not at-00 a.m.

192
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,481
但是冰茶或者…茶。是的。
But iced tea or... Tea. Yeah.

193
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:57,082
茶。我可以做到。
Tea. I can do that.

194
00:21:58,723 --> 00:22:00,756
进来的时候看到很多游客。
Saw a lot of tourists on the way in.

195
00:22:01,891 --> 00:22:05,898
资金快用完了，所以…总得有人为这一切付出代价。
Well, the funding's dried up, so... somebody's got to pay for all this.

196
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,368
正确的。谢谢你！
Right. Thank you.

197
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:14,006
我读了你关于土壤科学和再生农业的文章。
I read your articles about soil science and regenerative farming.

198
00:22:14,142 --> 00:22:16,167
-很棒。——谢谢。
- It was great. - Thanks.

199
00:22:16,303 --> 00:22:18,636
让我有了希望，有了改变。
Gave me grounds for some hope, for a change.

200
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,008
你的孩子们好吗?
How are your kids?

201
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:23,744
很神奇的。增长。
Amazing. Grown.

202
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,743
这是令人震惊的。他们都在上大学。
It's shocking. They're both in college.

203
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,248
你能相信吗?
Can you believe that?

204
00:22:27,383 --> 00:22:28,883
和马克?
And Mark?

205
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,757
结束了。
It's over.

206
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,757
哦。
Oh.

207
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,654
哦，听到这个消息我很难过。
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

208
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,260
没关系。
It's okay.

209
00:22:39,395 --> 00:22:40,798
我又回到了我自己。
I'm back to me.

210
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:42,191
我的工作。
My work.

211
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,266
-你知道，这…——太好了。
- You know, it's... - That's great.

212
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:45,861
很好。它是。
It's good. It is.

213
00:22:45,996 --> 00:22:47,433
我终于独自一人了。
I'm alone at last.

214
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:48,934
激动人心的时刻。
Exciting times.

215
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,540
是啊，我过着艾伦·格兰特的生活。
Yeah, I'm living the Alan Grant life.

216
00:22:51,675 --> 00:22:53,274
-它只是…-可以很孤独
- It's just... - Can be lonely.

217
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:54,909
.．.很自由
...so free.

218
00:22:57,611 --> 00:23:04,787
艾莉……你大老远跑出来，不就是为了追我吧?
Ellie... You didn't come out all this way just to catch up, now, did you?

219
00:23:08,624 --> 00:23:10,294
嗯，这是一只蝗虫。
Well, it's a locust.

220
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:15,730
下颚，翅膀，胸部，但是…天啊，它太大了。
Mandibles, wings, thorax, but... God, the size of it is massive.

221
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:24,240
它拥有自白垩纪以来就已经灭绝的基因，从爱荷华州到德克萨斯州，它们的大量繁殖正在摧毁农作物。
It has genes that have been extinct since the Cretaceous, and swarms of them are decimating crops from Iowa to Texas.

222
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,369
可怕的,对吧?
Terrifying, right?

223
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,911
从几百开始。
Started as a few hundred.

224
00:23:29,046 --> 00:23:31,016
到这个夏天结束，可能会有数百万人。
There could be millions by the end of the summer.

225
00:23:31,152 --> 00:23:35,519
如果他们继续下去，就没有粮食喂鸡、喂牛了。
If they keep going, there will be no grain to feed chickens, cattle.

226
00:23:35,655 --> 00:23:37,823
整个食物链将会崩溃。
The entire food chain would collapse.

227
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:42,122
显然是设计好的，但为什么会有人这么做呢?
Well, it's clearly designed, but why would anyone do that?

228
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:46,996
他们吃的作物都不是生物合成纤维的种子。
None of the crops they're eating are Biosyn seed.

229
00:23:47,132 --> 00:23:48,696
Biosyn。
Biosyn.

230
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:50,334
你是说这是生物合成的。
You're saying Biosyn made this.

231
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:54,701
我是说，他们想控制世界的食物供应我也不会感到惊讶。
I mean, it would not shock me that they want to control the world's food supply.

232
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:57,208
在数百万人挨饿之前。
Not before a few million starve.

233
00:23:57,344 --> 00:23:58,742
那是什么意思?
Yeah, what is that saying?

234
00:23:58,877 --> 00:24:01,605
我们离混乱只有三顿饭了吗?
Uh, we're three meals away from anarchy?

235
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,408
如果我们不阻止他们，你可以选择最后的三餐。
If we don't stop them, you can pick your last three meals.

236
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:08,878
那你为什么要告诉我?
So why are you bringing it to me?

237
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:12,786
我需要确凿的证据生物合成人要为这一切负责。
I need concrete evidence Biosyn's responsible for all this.

238
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:17,156
我得去他们的避难所提取另一只蝗虫的DNA。
I need to go to their sanctuary and get DNA from another locust there.

239
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:21,097
但我需要一个证人。
But I need a witness.

240
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:22,492
艾伦。
Alan.

241
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,599
你命令的尊重。相信你的人。
You command respect. People believe you.

242
00:24:25,734 --> 00:24:27,703
艾莉。
Ellie.

243
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,536
你知道我为什么来这里吗?它是安静的。
You know why I'm here? It's quiet.

244
00:24:29,672 --> 00:24:31,076
我受够了。
I'm done with all that.

245
00:24:31,212 --> 00:24:33,079
是吗?好吧。
Are you? Okay.

246
00:24:33,214 --> 00:24:34,939
我很抱歉，艾伦。
Well, I'm sorry, Alan.

247
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,905
没人再享受这种奢侈了。
Nobody gets that luxury anymore.

248
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:38,578
即使是你。
Not even you.

249
00:24:38,713 --> 00:24:40,580
你知道吗?
And you know what?

250
00:24:40,716 --> 00:24:42,252
你是我信任的人。
You're the one I trust.

251
00:24:47,358 --> 00:24:50,493
这个生物合成人庇护所离什么地方都有一百英里吗?
This Biosyn sanctuary is what, a hundred miles from anywhere?

252
00:24:50,629 --> 00:24:51,997
你是怎么进去的?
How do you even get in there?

253
00:24:52,132 --> 00:24:53,562
我收到了邀请。
I got an invite.

254
00:24:53,697 --> 00:24:55,898
来自他们内部的哲学家。
From their in-house philosopher.

255
00:24:56,931 --> 00:25:00,234
看来现在做一个混乱学家能赚很多钱。
Seems there's a lot of money in being a chaotician these days.

256
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:03,599
他就这么突然邀请了你，对吧?
And he just happened to invite you out of the blue, huh?

257
00:25:04,635 --> 00:25:06,253
他说有些东西我想看。
He said there were things I'd want to see.

258
00:25:06,277 --> 00:25:07,437
啊哈。
Uh-huh.

259
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,818
你来不来?
You coming or what?

260
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,385
在大陆上捕获的每只动物都要经过这里才会被运到白云石的生物合成保护区。
Every animal captured on the mainland comes through here before shipping out to Biosyn's sanctuary in the Dolomites.

261
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:38,275
我们对他们进行医疗照顾确保他们健康离开
We give them medical attention and make sure they leave healthy.

262
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,279
如此多的安全。
So much security.

263
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,010
这些只是你看到的。
Those are just the ones you see.

264
00:25:42,145 --> 00:25:44,441
外面有很多见不得光的人想要这些人。
A lot of shady types out there want these guys.

265
00:25:46,982 --> 00:25:48,677
你的飞机正在加油。
Your plane's just fueling up.

266
00:25:49,813 --> 00:25:52,216
生物合成是一个很难的邀请。你们肯定认识什么人。
Biosyn's a tough invite. You guys must know somebody.

267
00:25:52,352 --> 00:25:54,286
-你介意我…吗?——当然。
- Do you mind if I...? - Of course.

268
00:25:55,953 --> 00:25:57,689
你好。
Hello.

269
00:25:57,824 --> 00:25:59,064
你看到我吗?
You see me?

270
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:00,564
跟我来。
Follow me.

271
00:26:00,699 --> 00:26:04,447
几周前我们从内华达州的一个非法养殖场救了这些人。

-哦…——顶端食肉动物?
- Oh... - Apex predator?

410
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:45,750
猎物。
Giganotosaurus.

411
00:35:45,885 --> 00:35:47,945
至少现在是这样。
At least for now.

412
00:35:57,396 --> 00:36:00,429
你不让人进去的，对吧?
Uh, you don't let people in there, right?

413
00:36:00,565 --> 00:36:05,760
不，我们的研究…我们的研究前哨完全连接在地下。
Uh, no, our-our research... Our research outposts are connected completely underground.

414
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:12,748
如果有必要，我们可以用一种直接向大脑发送电信号的神经植入装置远程驱赶动物。
If we have to, we can just herd the animals remotely using a neuro-implant that sends electrical signals directly to the brain.

415
00:36:12,878 --> 00:36:14,307
比如电击?
Like shocks?

416
00:36:14,443 --> 00:36:17,315
不，是类似li的信号。
Uh, n-no, li-like signals.

417
00:36:17,451 --> 00:36:21,744
你不觉得有点…——残忍?——残忍。
Doesn't it strike you as a little bit, uh... - Cruel? - Cruel.

418
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:26,082
你知道侏罗纪公园的电网有多少电压吗?
Do you know how much voltage was in the electric fences at Jurassic Park?

419
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:27,990
是的。
Yeah.

420
00:36:34,161 --> 00:36:38,826
请和Ian Malcolm博士一起在中午的讲堂参加“基因力量的伦理”。
WOMAN Please join Dr. Ian Malcolm at noon in the lecture hall for "The Ethics of Genetic Power."

421
00:36:38,962 --> 00:36:40,831
天啊，每个人都那么年轻。
God, everyone's so young.

422
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:44,300
吸引最优秀最聪明的人才是我们的理念之一。
Oh, well, it is part of our ethos to attract the best and brightest.

423
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:46,278
医生。
Doctors.

424
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:50,113
德高望重的萨特勒博士，格兰特博士。
Respected, renowned Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant.

425
00:36:50,248 --> 00:36:52,347
嗨。我…哇，这太大了。
Hi. I'm... Wow, this is big.

426
00:36:52,482 --> 00:36:54,646
——我——我刘易斯。——道奇森。是的。
- I'm-I'm Lewis. - Dodgson. Yeah.

427
00:36:54,781 --> 00:36:56,051
-嗨。-你是路易斯·道奇森?
- Hi. - You're Lewis Dodgson?

428
00:36:56,187 --> 00:36:57,487
我是。你好!
I am. How do you do?

429
00:36:57,622 --> 00:36:59,619
我们没想到会在这里见到你。
We didn't expect to actually see you here.

430
00:36:59,754 --> 00:37:00,994
我也不会去别的地方。
Oh, well, I wouldn't be anywhere else.

431
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,219
——你会吗?——没有。
- Would you? - No.

432
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,854
我是说，你在这里看到的这些人正在改变世界。
I mean, the people you see here are changing the world.

433
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:09,025
你介不介意我们…——嗯…——哦。
Would you mind if we, um... - Uh... - Oh.

434
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:17,201
只是为了……这对我意义重大。如果……你想不想…——哦,太棒了。非常感谢。——哦,嗯…Th-That很好。这很好。谢谢。
Just to... It would mean a lot. If... Do you want to, um... - Oh, great. Thank you so much. - Oh, uh... Th-That's good. That's good. Thanks.

435
00:37:17,337 --> 00:37:21,809
所以，你们今天将会看到一些了不起的事情。
So, you are going to see some remarkable things today.

436
00:37:21,944 --> 00:37:25,379
我们正在释放基因组的真正力量。
We are unlocking the true power of the genome.

437
00:37:25,515 --> 00:37:27,018
我们这接近。相信我。
We're this close. Believe me.

438
00:37:27,153 --> 00:37:28,876
你会赚大钱的。
You'll make a fortune with that.

439
00:37:29,012 --> 00:37:31,022
不，不是钱的问题。
No, it's not about money.

440
00:37:31,157 --> 00:37:34,350
不，我们已经发现了几十种古生物dna的应用。
No, we've already identified dozens of applications for paleo-DNA.

441
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:38,096
我们说的是癌症阿兹海默症自身免疫性疾病
We're talking about cancer, Alzheimer's, autoimmune.

442
00:37:38,231 --> 00:37:41,664
我们是在拯救生命，但是…我敢打赌。
We will be saving lives, but... I bet.

443
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:49,107
嗯，不管怎样，我希望我能亲自带你参观，但是，呃，这是…所以你和拉姆齐的关系很好。
Um, anyway, I wish I could take you around myself, but, uh, it's, uh... So, you're in more-than-capable hands with Ramsay.

444
00:37:49,242 --> 00:37:58,712
他基本上是一个……一个年轻的我，只是更聪明，更高…你有吃的吗?
He's basically a... a young me, only smarter and, uh, taller... Do you have food?

445
00:37:58,847 --> 00:38:03,452
-比如我的酒吧?——原谅?嗯…不,没关系。我去找点事做。
- Like, one of my bars? - Pardon? Um... No, never mind. Uh, uh, I'll find something.

446
00:38:03,588 --> 00:38:11,558
所以，呃，我想做更多这样的事，嗯，以后如果我们，嗯……哦，我们给你订了一个私人舱，为了你的旅行，所以…——好的
So, uh, I want to do more of this, um, later on if we, um... Oh, we booked you a private pod - for the trip out, so... - Right.

447
00:38:11,693 --> 00:38:12,933
它是美丽的。你会喜欢的。
It's beautiful. You'll love it.

448
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:14,464
穿过洞穴什么的。
Through the caverns and everything.

449
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,027
你最好快点。马尔科姆的。
Uh, you better hurry. Malcolm's on.

450
00:38:16,162 --> 00:38:18,199
他有点特立独行，但我喜欢他。
He's a bit of a contrarian, but I like him.

451
00:38:18,335 --> 00:38:19,562
他让我们保持警觉。
He keeps us on our toes.

452
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:23,001
无论如何……谢谢你们的到来。这是……
Anyway... Thank you for being here. It's...

453
00:38:25,376 --> 00:38:27,742
好的，请跟我来。
Okay, um, follow me, please.

454
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,109
什么?
What?

455
00:38:31,244 --> 00:38:39,721
与这个星球上的任何其他生物相比，人类没有更多的安全或自由的权利。
Human beings have no more right to safety or liberty than any other creature on this planet.

456
00:38:41,462 --> 00:38:48,224
我们不仅没有支配自然的能力，我们还从属于自然。
We not only lack dominion over nature, we're subordinate to it.

457
00:38:49,234 --> 00:38:54,430
而现在，我们有机会在指尖上改写生活。
And now here we are with the opportunity to rewrite life at our fingertips.

458
00:38:54,566 --> 00:39:06,748
就像核能一样，没有人知道基因工程会带来什么，但他们按下按钮，希望能有最好的结果……就像你现在做的一样。
And just like nuclear power, nobody knew what to expect with genetic engineering, but they pressed the button and hoped for the best... just like you are doing now.

459
00:39:07,888 --> 00:39:10,114
是的。你。
Yep. You.

460
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:16,825
你掌控着我们在地球上生存的未来。
You control the future of our survival on planet Earth.

461
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,696
根据你的说法，解决办法是遗传力量。
According to you, the solution is genetic power.

462
00:39:19,831 --> 00:39:27,831
但同样的力量会摧毁食物供应，制造新的疾病，甚至进一步改变气候。
But that same power could devastate the food supply, create new diseases, alter the climate even further.

463
00:39:27,967 --> 00:39:31,705
发生不可预见的后果。
Unforeseen consequences occur.

464
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:40,717
每一次，每一次... ...我们都表现得很惊讶?
And every time, every single time... ...we all act surprised?

465
00:39:40,852 --> 00:39:46,825
因为在内心深处，我认为我们没有人真的相信这些危险是真的。
Because deep down, I don't think that any of us actually believe that these dangers are real.

466
00:39:54,525 --> 00:40:03,875
要发动革命性的变革，就必须改造人的意识。
In order to instigate revolutionary change, we must transform human consciousness.

467
00:40:11,613 --> 00:40:12,878
——是吗?——嗯。
- May am? - Mm-hmm.

468
00:40:13,014 --> 00:40:14,678
博士。马尔科姆吗?——非常好。
...Dr. Malcolm? - Very good.

469
00:40:14,814 --> 00:40:16,347
有你走。
There-there you go.

470
00:40:16,483 --> 00:40:18,491
嘿，我不想对我的朋友无礼。谢谢你！
Hey, I don't want to be rude to my friends. Thank you.

471
00:40:18,515 --> 00:40:20,584
我出去的时候再来找我。谢谢,每一个人。
Catch me on my way out. Thanks, everybody.

472
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:25,887
看看你，看看我，再看看你。
Look at you, and look at me, and look at you.

473
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,660
哇，这太迷幻了。
Wow, this is so trippy.

474
00:40:27,795 --> 00:40:29,893
你看起来很好。
You look like you're doing well.

475
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:34,931
我有五个孩子，你知道的，我爱他们胜过生命本身，所以…费用加起来了。
Well, I got five kids, you know, whom I adore more than life itself, so... uh, expenses add up.

476
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:39,502
你,艾伦?你是…你是…你有家人吗?
You, Alan? Are you... are you... You have any family or...?

477
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:40,638
不。
No.

478
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,007
我得跟你谈谈。
So, uh, I need to talk to you.

479
00:40:43,143 --> 00:40:44,613
我也需要和你谈谈。
Yeah, I need to talk to you, too.

480
00:40:44,749 --> 00:40:47,079
——私下里。-你们俩经常聊天吗?
- Privately. - Do you two talk a lot?

481
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:49,354
-他溜进了我的数据仓库-他做了什么?
- Uh, he slid into my DMs. - He did what?

482
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,554
-很紧急，伊恩。-你做了什么?
- It's urgent, Ian. - What did you do?

483
00:40:51,689 --> 00:40:53,284
"离午夜还有7分钟"之类的。
"Seven minutes to midnight" stuff.

484
00:40:53,419 --> 00:41:01,129
末日之钟也许快没时间了，但俗话说，永恒的虚无之前总是最黑暗的。
Uh, the Doomsday Clock might be about out of time, but as they say, it's always darkest just before eternal nothingness.

485
00:41:01,264 --> 00:41:02,666
什么?
What?

486
00:41:04,704 --> 00:41:07,867
蝗虫，被白垩纪DNA改变。
Locusts, altered with Cretaceous-era DNA.

487
00:41:08,002 --> 00:41:09,399
是的，那不是我的领域。
Yeah, that's not my field.

488
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:14,243
是啊，但如果这些东西继续增加，我们就要面对的是级联系统效应，伊恩。
Yeah, but if these things continue to multiply, we're talking about cascading system-wide effects, Ian.

489
00:41:14,379 --> 00:41:15,939
天啊，那太烦人了。
Gosh, that's a drag.

490
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:18,045
你怎么了?
What is the matter with you?

491
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,087
为什么?你有什么特别想让我做的吗?
Why? Is there something special you want me to do?

492
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:21,309
是啊，管他呢?
Yeah, how about give a damn?

493
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:22,785
你知道的太多了，不能不关心。
You know far too much not to care.

494
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,481
多年来，我一直坚定地表达自己的观点。
Hey, I-I gave my opinion robustly for years.

495
00:41:26,616 --> 00:41:36,631
不出所料，我们人类的努力最终导致了我们的灭亡，现在唯一的办法就是抓紧我们剩下的时间，就像我们一直做的那样，把时间浪费掉。
As expected, the sum of our human endeavors has led to our annihilation, and the only play now is to take the time that we have left and, uh, you know, just like we always do, squander it.

496
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:39,798
老实说，伊恩，那是扯淡。
Honestly, Ian, that's bullshit.

497
00:41:39,934 --> 00:41:42,066
要喝点咖啡吗?
Can I offer you guys some joe?

498
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:45,836
泰勒，两杯卡布奇诺。
Uh, Tyler, please, two cappuccinos.

499
00:41:45,972 --> 00:41:47,670
我不想喝卡布奇诺。
I don't want a cappuccino.

500
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,516
我可以来点可塔朵或者玛奇朵。
Uh, well, I could do, like, a cortado or, like, macchiato.

501
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,282
相信我，时差真的很难熬。
Trust me, it's real tough, that jet lag.

502
00:41:51,418 --> 00:41:52,578
它会让你振作起来的。
It's gonna perk you right up.

503
00:41:56,813 --> 00:42:00,489
这些蝗虫是一个更大的项目“六足动物联盟”的一部分。
The locusts are part of a larger project called Hexapod Allies.

504
00:42:00,624 --> 00:42:02,020
他们的意图你说对了。
You're right about their intent.

505
00:42:02,156 --> 00:42:04,357
我六周前开始听到传言。
I started hearing rumors six weeks ago.

506
00:42:04,493 --> 00:42:06,804
我读了你那篇关于颓废的文章，把事实和事实联系起来了。
I read your piece on decadence and put two and two together.

507
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:08,359
我没有提高我的声音。
I was not raising my voice.

508
00:42:08,494 --> 00:42:10,075
你开始。是渐强了，不是吗?
You're beginning to. It's crescendoing, isn't it?

509
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:11,793
他们疯狂地扩散。
They're proliferating wildly.

510
00:42:11,928 --> 00:42:13,915
它们的寿命是正常寿命的三到四倍。
They're lasting three, four times longer than they should.

511
00:42:13,939 --> 00:42:17,637
我所有的模型都指向全球生态崩溃，伊恩。
And all my models are pointing toward a global ecological collapse, Ian.

512
00:42:17,773 --> 00:42:19,334
楼下,分段6。
Downstairs, sublevel six.

513
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,311
他们把蝗虫关在那里。
That's where they keep the locusts.

514
00:42:21,447 --> 00:42:23,374
找一个标记为L4的实验室。
Look for a lab marked L4.

515
00:42:23,509 --> 00:42:25,349
等等，我们要怎么下去啊?
But wait, how are we ever gonna get down there?

516
00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:26,979
嘿，这看起来真顺滑。
Hey, this looks so silky.

517
00:42:27,115 --> 00:42:28,683
我能摸摸这件衬衫吗?
May I touch this blouse, by any chance?

518
00:42:28,818 --> 00:42:30,348
——确定。-你知道是什么吗?
- Sure. - You know what it is?

519
00:42:30,484 --> 00:42:32,159
-不要告诉…不要告诉我。-你不会知道的。
- Don't tell... Don't tell me. - You won't know it.

520
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:34,121
这是可持续竹子。
This is sustainable bamboo.

521
00:42:34,256 --> 00:42:36,133
-这是可持续竹子。-所以我才这么说
- It is sustainable bamboo. - That's why I said it.

522
00:42:36,157 --> 00:42:37,797
你怎么知道的?-我就是知道。
- How did you know that? - I just know it.

523
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,269
-是啊，太棒了。我有孜然。
- Yeah, it's amazing. - - I've got cumin.

524
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:40,810
-太神奇了。-我有肉桂。
- It's very amazing. - I've got cinnamon.

525
00:42:40,834 --> 00:42:42,336
我有多香果，不是很受欢迎。
I've got allspice, which is not very popular.

526
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,701
-我有五香粉。- - - - - -医生。
- I've got five-spice. - Doctor.

527
00:42:43,837 --> 00:42:45,109
如果你喜欢那种感觉的话。
Um, if you're into that kind of feel.

528
00:42:45,133 --> 00:42:47,867
-嗯，我们来谈谈牛奶。-是的。
- Um, and let's talk milks. - Yeah.

529
00:42:48,002 --> 00:42:49,898
好吧。豆奶,是吗?
Okay. Soy milk, yes?

530
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:53,836
……没有。-刚刚发生了什么?
...No. - What just happened?

531

路易斯，你没在听我说。
Lewis, you're not listening to me.

00:43:20,873 --> 00:43:24,666
蝗虫的史前DNA使它们比应有的更强壮。
The locusts' prehistoric DNA has made them stronger than they should be.

535
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:27,239

They're multiplying like crazy, and they're not dying.

536
00:43:27,374 --> 00:43:28,885
你哪里不明白了?

这将是一场全球性的饥荒。

539
00:43:32,082 --> 00:43:33,784
嘿，嘿，我们不能预测所有的事情。

我们必须消灭那些被释放的人。

541
00:43:36,522 --> 00:43:38,216
——什么?-所有人。

542
00:43:38,352 --> 00:43:40,458
——没有。不。亨利。——就像……昨天,。

没有这种事。
There is no such thing.

546
00:43:58,437 --> 00:44:01,642
当我们害怕的时候，我们会怎么做?
When we're afraid, what do we do?

547
00:44:01,778 --> 00:44:03,577
我们以前做过什么?
What have we done before?

548
00:44:03,712 --> 00:44:06,448
我们坚持到底。
We follow through.

549
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:08,316
这就是我们所做的。
That's what we do.

550
00:44:08,451 --> 00:44:09,919
对吧?
Right?

551
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:13,615
正确的。
Right.

552
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,887
我们找到那个女孩了。
We found the girl.

553
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,463
她在途中。
She's en route.

554
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,799
-花了我一大笔钱——什么?

555
00:44:21,934 --> 00:44:24,159
-等等，你找到她了?-找到他们俩了

556
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:26,603
她和小迅猛龙。
Her and the little raptor.

557
00:44:26,738 --> 00:44:29,137
布鲁独自繁殖后代

558
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,133
就像你说的。你真聪明，亨利。

559
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:36,847
这就是为什么这个行得通。
That's why this works.

560

你知道这些生物的价值。

你总是。我也做。

562
00:44:40,754 --> 00:44:44,723
我们不会因为一个，什么，小项目失败就放弃吗?
And we don't stop because a, what, little side project went south?

563
00:44:46,585 --> 00:44:51,625
嘿。如果他们把蝗虫追踪到我们身上，他们就是冲着恐龙来的。
Hey. If they trace the locusts back to us, they come for the dinosaurs.

564
00:44:51,761 --> 00:44:53,292
你所有的工作都没了。

数十亿美元的资产化为乌有。

没有人开采的钻石。

567

你真觉得她能解决问题吗

568
00:45:07,906 --> 00:45:09,771
好吧。
Okay.

569
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:13,246
跟那女孩有关的一切都要经过我，对吧?
Everything involving the girl goes through me, right?

570
00:45:15,278 --> 00:45:16,781
她还好吗?
Is she all right?

571
00:45:16,917 --> 00:45:18,119
她最好。

574
00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:35,532

577
00:45:38,676 --> 00:45:39,972
我们分开飞行。
We flew them separately.

578
00:45:40,107 --> 00:45:41,371
我不会冒险的。
I'm not taking any chances.

579
00:45:41,507 --> 00:45:43,813
我们需要在交货前付款。

我不喜欢上次发生的事。

00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:11,733
走到车那里。

585
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:15,242
——没有。-这不是一个选择

开一架小猛禽要5万美元。

——嗨,克莱尔。

00:47:14,438 --> 00:47:17,071
我以为你会选择更安静的工作。
I thought you would've chosen a quieter line of work.

We don't have intel on his cargo, but once they make the exchange, we'll see what they know about your girl.

Claire, I know this must feel exotic, but if you mess with the wrong person down here, you disappear.

00:52:20,503 --> 00:52:21,610
大便。
Shit.

670
00:52:23,378 --> 00:52:24,705
把卡车开出去!
Get that truck out of here!

671
00:52:32,688 --> 00:52:34,087
我们失去了德拉库尔!
AGENT We lost Delacourt!

672
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,962
这里是b1。
This is Bravo One.

673
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:49,735
卡车正在接近地下通道。
Truck is approaching the underpass.

674
00:54:03,779 --> 00:54:05,408
来吧!
Come on!

675
00:54:20,395 --> 00:54:21,595
那个女孩，她在哪里?
The girl, where is she?

676
00:54:21,731 --> 00:54:23,430
-他们把她带到哪里去了?-把它弄下来!
- Where did they take her? - Get it off!

677
00:54:23,566 --> 00:54:25,233
-她在哪里?-我不知道!
- Where is she? - I don't know!

678
00:54:25,368 --> 00:54:27,195
我们把她交给桑托斯了。
We handed her off to Santos.

679
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:29,399
我不知道之后他们把她带到哪里去了。
I don't know where they took her after that.

680
00:54:42,417 --> 00:54:44,188
克莱尔,桑托斯。
Claire, it's Santos.

681
00:54:44,324 --> 00:54:46,017
-穿白衣服的女人。-我会找到她的。
- The woman in white. - I'll find her.

682
00:54:46,153 --> 00:54:48,491
b队，注意后方。
Bravo team, watch your six.

683
00:54:49,693 --> 00:54:51,852
.．.嘿,嘿!
...Hey, hey!

684
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:53,720
——嘿!——抓住它!
- Hey! - Hold it!

685
00:54:53,856 --> 00:54:55,556
让他们出去。
Let them out.

686
00:54:55,691 --> 00:54:56,691
什么? !
What?!

687
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:58,600
你没听错。
You heard me.

688
00:55:23,422 --> 00:55:25,121
Merde。
Merde.

689
00:55:42,779 --> 00:55:44,646
克莱尔，你找到她了吗?
OWEN Claire, do you have her?

690
00:55:58,295 --> 00:55:59,625
我们遇到了一些麻烦。
We had some trouble.

691
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,529
——什么?——父母。
- What kind? - The parents.

692
00:56:01,665 --> 00:56:03,623
Grady 和 Dearing... 他们来了。
Grady and Dearing... They're here.

693
00:56:07,601 --> 00:56:08,872
你能处理一下吗?
Can you take care of it?

694
00:56:09,008 --> 00:56:10,700
不是免费的。
Not for free.

695
00:56:10,836 --> 00:56:12,773
嗯,这样做。
Well, do it.

696
00:56:20,817 --> 00:56:23,487
妈妈。
Mama.

697
00:56:27,491 --> 00:56:29,057
好吧,好吧,听着。
Okay, okay, listen.

698
00:56:29,192 --> 00:56:30,786
不,不,不。
No, no, no.

699
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,800
你不会用在别人身上。
You don't use it on people.

700
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:47,002
我的女儿在哪里?
Where's my daughter?

701
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,409
她本来就不是你的。
She wasn't yours to begin with.

702
00:56:51,444 --> 00:56:53,209
告诉我。
Tell me.

703
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:56,010
Biosyn。
Biosyn.

704
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:59,050
他们要带她去生化系统。
They're taking her to Biosyn.

705
00:57:04,491 --> 00:57:06,523
你错过了她。
You missed her.

706
00:57:06,658 --> 00:57:08,157
她走了。
She's gone.

707
00:57:59,947 --> 00:58:01,550
牵起我的手。来吧。
Take my hand. Come on.

708
00:58:32,283 --> 00:58:33,679
抓住紧。
Hold on tight.

709
00:58:33,814 --> 00:58:35,349
什么?
What?

710
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:48,461
你还记得我们以前是怎么把猛禽开进卡车的吗?
Do you remember how we used to get the raptors in the truck?

711
00:58:48,597 --> 00:58:49,963
-是的。-是的。
- Yeah. - Yeah.

712
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:52,794
——你。——没有。
- You're up. - No.

713
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:55,970
在最后一分钟，跳水。
At the last minute, dive-roll.

714
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:58,202
-我不跳水。-你会没事的。
- I don't dive-roll. - You'll be fine.

715
00:58:58,337 --> 00:59:00,303
我从来没有把握好时机。
I never got the timing right.

716
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:03,005
现在?
Now?

717
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,780
随时，随时。
Any minute. Any minute now.

718
00:59:05,778 --> 00:59:07,442
——现在?——没有。
- Now? - No.

719
00:59:09,648 --> 00:59:10,918
现在!
Now!

720
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:16,484
是的。是啊!
Yeah. Yeah!

721
00:59:17,689 --> 00:59:18,858
别动
Freeze.

722
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:27,504
我要带我们离开这里。
I'm flying us out of here.

723
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,080
告诉我你想被扔在哪里。
Tell me where you want to be dropped.

724
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:30,531
你坐过飞机吗?
You ever flown to Biosyn?

725
00:59:32,175 --> 00:59:34,406
克莱尔·欧文，他们把她带到生化系统!
CLAIRE Owen, they took her to Biosyn!

726
00:59:34,541 --> 00:59:36,788
-在岛的北边有一个机场。——走吧。
- There's an airfield on the north side of the island. - Go.

727
00:59:36,812 --> 00:59:38,247
你被捕了。
You're under arrest.

728
00:59:38,383 --> 00:59:39,881
待在原地别动。
Stay where you are.

729
01:00:06,034 --> 01:00:07,909
没错!
Right!

730
01:00:12,646 --> 01:00:13,743
小心!
Heads up!

731
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:53,139
我们今天树敌不少。
We made a lot of enemies today.

732
01:01:53,275 --> 01:01:54,308
我们得走了。
We got to go.

733
01:01:54,443 --> 01:01:55,786
-他会来的。——嗯。
- He'll be here. - Uh-huh.

734
01:01:59,855 --> 01:02:01,858
没时间了，没时间了。
Out of time, out of time.

735
01:02:03,625 --> 01:02:05,257
他就在这里。
There he is.

736
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:09,690
——靠边。-飞机不是这样的。
- Pull over. - That's not how planes work.

737
01:02:16,034 --> 01:02:17,636
打开后面。
Open the back.

738
01:02:36,151 --> 01:02:37,388
来吧!
Come on!

739
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:45,000
抓紧!
Hold on tight!

740
01:03:01,212 --> 01:03:03,678
哦,上海…
Oh, sh...

741
01:03:14,191 --> 01:03:15,690
还有它。
Still got it.

742
01:03:34,683 --> 01:03:36,880
凯拉瓦。
Kayla Watts.

743
01:03:37,015 --> 01:03:38,713
不客气
You're welcome.

744
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,715
你看起来不像是为生物syn飞行的。
You don't look like you fly for Biosyn.

745
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:44,088
我要听你的真心话而不是听你说的话。
I'm gonna take that the way you meant it and not the way it sounded.

746
01:03:44,224 --> 01:03:47,256
谁有包我就从谁那飞过去，但这算是帮了个忙吧。
I fly from whoever got a bag, but we'll call this one a favor.

747
01:03:47,392 --> 01:03:49,933
那些不工作。他们破产了。
Those don't work. They broke.

748
01:03:51,428 --> 01:03:54,798
我会带你们去生化城，但我不能保证不会有危险。
I'll take y'all to Biosyn, but I can't promise it won't be dangerous.

749
01:03:54,933 --> 01:03:57,699
你愿意为素未谋面的人冒生命危险?
You're willing to risk your life for people you never met?

750
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:02,077
你是想问问题，还是想搭车?
You want to ask questions, or you want a ride?

751
01:04:05,111 --> 01:04:06,647
我们要去兜风。
We'll take the ride.

752
01:04:13,882 --> 01:04:15,959
这是我们的栖息地开发实验室。
So, this is our habitat development lab.

753
01:04:16,094 --> 01:04:18,487
最近有很多令人兴奋的发现。
A lot of exciting discoveries as of late.

754
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:23,599
我们带回了无数物种最纯净的形态，我的意思是完整的、未被触及的基因组。
We've brought back numerous species in their purest form, and I mean complete, untouched genomes.

755
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:25,325
像摩洛人intrepidus。
Like Moros intrepidus.

756
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:27,095
——什么?-是的。
- What? - Yeah.

757
01:04:28,463 --> 01:04:29,933
哇。
Wow.

758
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:34,942
那么拼接DNA呢?
What about splicing DNA?

759
01:04:35,077 --> 01:04:36,837
你知道，创造新物种?
You know, creating new species?

760
01:04:36,972 --> 01:04:39,377
不，萨特勒医生，我们这里不这么做。
Uh, no, Dr. Sattler, we don't do that here.

761
01:04:39,512 --> 01:04:41,413
我们喜欢认为自己进化得更好。
We like to think we're more evolved.

762
01:04:46,288 --> 01:04:48,561
看来离你的车来还有一段时间。
Okay, it looks like we still have some time left before your ride.

763
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:51,890
你们想亲自参观一下这些设施吗?
Uh, would you guys like to tour the facilities yourselves?

764
01:04:52,025 --> 01:04:56,128
哦，呃，我是说…嗯,我们可以。
Oh, uh, I mean... uh, we could.

765
01:04:56,263 --> 01:04:58,135
-是啊，为什么不呢?——太棒了。
- Yeah, why not? - - Great.

766
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:02,533
我30分钟后在超级高铁3号站见你们。
I'll meet you guys at the hyperloop, station three, in about 30 minutes.

767
01:05:02,668 --> 01:05:04,732
电梯在大厅的尽头。不会这些。
Elevators are down this hall. Not-not those.

768
01:05:04,868 --> 01:05:06,570
这些会把你引向下层。
Those lead you down to the sublevels.

769
01:05:06,706 --> 01:05:08,645
你需要特别许可才能进去。
You need special clearance to get down there.

770
01:05:08,781 --> 01:05:11,146
-哦,好的。- - - - - - 30分钟。
- Oh, okay. - 30 minutes.

771
01:05:20,055 --> 01:05:21,556
在这里。
Here.

772
01:05:21,691 --> 01:05:23,158
把这个。
Take this.

773
01:05:24,663 --> 01:05:26,854
——好吗?——是的。
- Okay? - Yep.

774
01:05:36,505 --> 01:05:39,500
我很抱歉事情发展成这样。
I'm really sorry that it had to happen this way.

775
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,739
是的，绑匪就是这么说的。
Yep, that's what kidnappers say.

776
01:05:43,379 --> 01:05:45,013
克莱尔不该把你藏起来的。
Claire should never have hidden you away.

777
01:05:45,148 --> 01:05:47,380
你太重要了，梅奇。
You're way too important, Maisie.

778
01:05:51,549 --> 01:05:53,518
你也带走了她。
You took her, too.

779
01:05:54,525 --> 01:05:56,191
是的。
Yeah.

780
01:05:56,326 --> 01:05:58,886
我们需要她帮我们了解你。
We needed her to help us understand you.

781
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,860
嘿,β。
Hey, Beta.

782
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,571
你没事吧?
You okay?

783
01:06:08,707 --> 01:06:09,968
你是说"贝塔"吗?
Did you say "Beta"?

784
01:06:10,103 --> 01:06:11,569
这是她的名字吗?
Is that her name?

785
01:06:12,567 --> 01:06:13,909
我给了她。
I gave it to her.

786
01:06:14,045 --> 01:06:15,641
β很特别。
Beta's pretty special.

787
01:06:15,777 --> 01:06:21,546
当我们造出"蓝"的时候，我们用巨蜥的DNA来填补她基因组的空白。
You know, when we made Blue, we used monitor lizard DNA to fill in the gaps in her genome.

788
01:06:21,681 --> 01:06:32,260
巨蜥可以在没有配偶的情况下繁殖，所以贝塔和蓝的基因是相同的，这就是它们与你和……夏洛特。
Monitor lizards can reproduce without a mate, so Beta and Blue are genetically identical, and that's what they have in common with you and... Charlotte.

789
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:36,466
你对夏洛特了解多少?
What do you know about Charlotte?

790
01:06:36,601 --> 01:06:38,200
她去世了。
She died.

791
01:06:39,197 --> 01:06:40,598
很久以前。
A long time ago.

792
01:06:41,631 --> 01:06:43,469
这伤了我爷爷的心。
It broke my grandpa's heart.

793
01:06:45,237 --> 01:06:46,802
所以他逼我。
So he made me.

794
01:06:48,407 --> 01:06:50,542
不，梅奇，事实上，他没有。
No, Maisie, actually, he didn't.

795
01:06:53,048 --> 01:06:55,151
夏洛特你。
Charlotte made you.

796
01:06:57,952 --> 01:07:00,684
我很高兴大家都能看到我们在这里所做的一切。
I'm so excited for everyone to see what we've been doing here.

797
01:07:00,819 --> 01:07:05,859
几乎每天都有新技术、新科学诞生。
There's new technology being made, new science, like, every day almost.

798
01:07:05,995 --> 01:07:10,826
成为…站在中心的感觉真好……中心的。
And it's great to be... it's great to be in the center... center of that.

799
01:07:10,962 --> 01:07:15,197
夏洛特和我们一起住在B站。
Charlotte lived on Site B with all of us.

800
01:07:15,332 --> 01:07:17,530
直到暴风雨。
Till the storm.

801
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:18,999
她喜欢恐龙。
She loved dinosaurs.

802
01:07:19,134 --> 01:07:20,433
亨利·夏洛特，小心点。
HENRY Charlotte, be careful.

803
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:21,968
是的,我会的。
Yeah, I will.

804
01:07:22,103 --> 01:07:23,971
她在科学家的陪伴下长大。
She grew up around scientists.

805
01:07:24,981 --> 01:07:29,845
然后,最终……她自己也成了。
Then, eventually... ... she became one herself.

806
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:31,945
今天早上一只蝴蝶飞进了我的办公室。
A butterfly flew into my office this morning.

807
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:36,318
他们说微小的事情会产生巨大的影响，我完全同意。
They say tiny things have huge impacts, and I agree wholeheartedly.

808
01:07:36,453 --> 01:07:38,458
她是聪明的。
She was brilliant.

809
01:07:40,129 --> 01:07:41,865
而我永远不会。
In ways that I'll never be.

810
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,729
在形而上学的同一性中，复制品真的是原作吗?
In the metaphysics of identity, can a replica truly be the original?

811
01:07:45,864 --> 01:07:49,502
如果这是可能的，是什么让它成为可能?
And if it's possible, what makes it so?

812
01:07:54,504 --> 01:07:56,377
我的钢笔丢了。
I've lost my pen.

813
01:07:59,783 --> 01:08:01,012
是我吗?
Is that me?

814
01:08:01,147 --> 01:08:03,382
是的。
Yeah.

815
01:08:03,517 --> 01:08:07,223
就像布鲁一样，夏洛特也能独自生下一个孩子。
Just like Blue, Charlotte was able to have a child all by herself.

816
01:08:08,324 --> 01:08:11,953
她用自己的DNA创造了你。
She created you with her own DNA.

817
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:15,090
所以我是有妈妈的。
So I do have a mother.

818
01:08:15,226 --> 01:08:18,362
你爷爷不想让任何人知道真相。
Your grandfather didn't want anyone to know the truth.

819
01:08:18,498 --> 01:08:21,369
他是在保护你和她
He was protecting her and you.

820
01:08:22,368 --> 01:08:23,800
我们是一样的吗?
And we're the same?

821
01:08:25,743 --> 01:08:27,001
你是。
You were.

822
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:31,175
当你还是个婴儿的时候，夏洛特就开始表现出遗传疾病的症状。
When you were a baby, Charlotte started to show symptoms of a genetic disorder.

823
01:08:31,311 --> 01:08:33,878
她就是这样死的。
That's how she died.

824
01:08:34,013 --> 01:08:37,445
你出生后她才知道她有。
She didn't know she had it until after you were born.

825
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,345
我也有吗?
Do I have it, too?

826
01:08:39,481 --> 01:08:40,680
不。
No.

827
01:08:40,815 --> 01:08:43,092
她改变了你的DNA。
She changed your DNA.

828
01:08:43,228 --> 01:08:48,264
她改变了你体内的每一个细胞来根除这种疾病。
She altered every cell in your body to eradicate this disease.

829
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,963
地球上还没有人知道该怎么做。
No one on earth has ever known how to do that.

830
01:08:51,099 --> 01:08:53,236
她治好了我
She fixed me.

831
01:08:53,372 --> 01:08:56,063
夏洛特的发现现在是你的一部分了。
Charlotte's discovery is a part of you now.

832
01:08:58,042 --> 01:09:01,407
你的DNA可以改变世界。
Your DNA could change the world.

833
01:09:01,542 --> 01:09:05,914
我必须知道她是怎么做到的，但我无法复制她的作品。
And I have to know how she did it, but I just can't replicate her work.

834
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:11,111
如果我能研究你和DNA从未改变的贝塔，我就能…
If I could just study you and Beta, whose DNA was never changed, I could...

835
01:09:13,457 --> 01:09:16,287
.．.弥补我犯下的严重错误
...fix a terrible mistake that I've made.

836
01:09:16,422 --> 01:09:18,294
什么样的错误?
What kind of mistake?

837
01:09:26,536 --> 01:09:28,931
分段6。限制。
Sublevel six. Restricted.

838
01:09:33,276 --> 01:09:35,036
谢谢你的到来。
Thanks for coming.

839
01:09:39,747 --> 01:09:41,443
艾伦:马尔科姆说的是哪个实验室?
ALAN Which lab did Malcolm say?

840
01:09:41,578 --> 01:09:43,385
L4。
L4.

841
01:09:47,286 --> 01:09:49,325
这是它。
This is it.

842
01:10:08,172 --> 01:10:11,879
好了，进去，拿到样本就出去。
Okay, get in, get the sample and get out.

843
01:10:12,015 --> 01:10:13,349
和移动缓慢。
And move slow.

844
01:10:13,485 --> 01:10:16,110
稍有干扰，它们就会蜂拥而至。
They can swarm at the slightest disturbance.

845
01:10:40,339 --> 01:10:41,971
直翅目。
Orthoptera.

846
01:10:42,979 --> 01:10:44,842
两个星期。
Two weeks.

847
01:10:48,513 --> 01:10:50,379
完全成熟。
Fully mature.

848
01:10:50,514 --> 01:10:52,019
这一个。
This one.

849
01:10:54,023 --> 01:10:55,886
准备好了吗?慢点
Ready? Easy.

850
01:11:00,457 --> 01:11:01,861
好吧。
Okay.

851
01:11:01,997 --> 01:11:03,366
走了。
Go.

852
01:11:04,362 --> 01:11:05,467
什么?
What?

853
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:08,228
去得到它。
Go get it.

854
01:11:09,897 --> 01:11:11,441
那是必要的吗?
Is that necessary?

855
01:11:11,576 --> 01:11:13,942
你以为会发生什么?
What did you think was gonna happen?

856
01:11:14,078 --> 01:11:15,377
我得取个样本。
I have to take a sample.

857
01:11:15,513 --> 01:11:17,180
我们需要具体的证据。这是它。
We need concrete evidence. This is it.

858
01:11:17,316 --> 01:11:19,210
艾伦，你说没时间了。
Alan, you said there was no time.

859
01:11:19,345 --> 01:11:20,707
你能接吗?
Can you get it?

860
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:22,880
我当然能拿到。
Of course I can get it.

861
01:11:23,883 --> 01:11:26,422
放松
Easy.

862
01:11:27,419 --> 01:11:28,890
看它的腿。
Watch its legs.

863
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:33,027
我们开始吧。
Here we go.

864
01:11:35,059 --> 01:11:36,340
它们之间是细胞信号传递。
They're cell signaling between them.

865
01:11:36,364 --> 01:11:37,426
这可不妙，艾莉。
This is not good, Ellie.

866
01:11:37,562 --> 01:11:38,693
几乎都得到了。
Almost got it.

867
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:47,774
亨利，如果你把电脑上的机密资料给她看，就是在指控我们俩有罪，那她怎么还能继续做线人?
How does she remain an asset, Henry, if you're incriminating both of us by showing her classified things on the computer?

868
01:11:47,909 --> 01:11:52,606
亨利·夏洛特·洛克伍德相信我们在侏罗纪公园使用的方法可以治愈疾病。
HENRY Charlotte Lockwood believed the methods we used at Jurassic Park could cure disease.

869
01:11:52,742 --> 01:11:54,109
她是对的。
She was right.

870
01:11:54,244 --> 01:12:02,124
在用改变的DNA填补了麦奇基因组的空白后，她用一种病原体将修复后的序列传递到每个细胞。
Having filled the gaps in Maisie's genome with altered DNA, she used a pathogen to deliver the repaired sequence to every cell.

871
01:12:02,259 --> 01:12:09,159
如果我能改变她所做的，我就能改变蝗虫的DNA，在一代人之内消灭它们。
If I can repurpose what she did, I could change the locusts' DNA, eradicating them in a single generation.

872
01:12:09,295 --> 01:12:13,099
麦奇和小迅猛龙会提供丢失的数据。
Maisie and the baby raptor will provide the missing data.

873
01:12:20,137 --> 01:12:22,445
嘿，你想离开这里吗?
Hey, do you want to get out of here?

874
01:12:25,813 --> 01:12:27,813
.．.什么……?
...What the...?

875
01:12:28,912 --> 01:12:30,150
明白了。
Got it.

876
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:35,925
……走吧!
...Go!

877
01:12:40,455 --> 01:12:42,096
他们无处不在!
They're everywhere!

878
01:12:42,231 --> 01:12:43,699
帮帮我!哦,上帝!
Help me! Oh, God!

879
01:12:43,835 --> 01:12:45,926
不!
No!

880
01:12:48,106 --> 01:12:49,505
哦,我的上帝!哦,我的上帝!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

881
01:12:55,011 --> 01:12:56,472
梅齐。
Maisie.

882
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,819
资产包含违反。
Asset containment breach.

883
01:13:09,954 --> 01:13:11,692
请各就各位。
Please remain at your stations.

884
01:13:13,495 --> 01:13:14,824
资产包含违反。
Asset containment breach.

885
01:13:14,959 --> 01:13:16,561
请各就各位。
Please remain at your stations.

886
01:13:19,365 --> 01:13:21,768
哦,我的上帝!天啊，我看不见了!关键在哪里?
Oh, my God! Oh, God, I can't see! Where's the key?

887
01:13:40,552 --> 01:13:42,187
你没事吧?
You okay?

888
01:13:42,322 --> 01:13:43,759
是的。
Yeah.

889
01:13:43,895 --> 01:13:45,355
你吗?
You?

890
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:46,853
是的。
Yeah.

891
01:13:49,056 --> 01:13:50,467
哦。
Oh.

892
01:13:56,299 --> 01:14:00,538
你们是埃莉·萨特勒医生和艾伦·格兰特。
You're Dr. Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant.

893
01:14:00,674 --> 01:14:02,706
你在侏罗纪公园。
You were at Jurassic Park.

894
01:14:02,842 --> 01:14:04,771
你在这里做什么?
What-what are you doing here?

895
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:08,749
什么?什么……你在这里做什么?
What? What... what are you doing here?

896
01:14:10,848 --> 01:14:12,654
我梅齐洛克伍德。
I'm Maisie Lockwood.

897
01:14:21,097 --> 01:14:28,465
嗯…嘿，我们不，呃…我们不是……我们不是为生物合成公司工作。
Um... Hey, we don't, uh... we're not... we don't work for Biosyn.

898
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,699
我可以告诉。
I can tell.

899
01:14:29,835 --> 01:14:31,040
我们得离开这里。
We got to get out of here.

900
01:14:31,176 --> 01:14:32,238
我们该走了。
Yeah, we should go.

901
01:14:47,924 --> 01:14:50,626
好了，进，出……我们找到你的女孩就走。
Okay, in and out... We find your girl and go.

902
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:53,663
塔台，这是N-141。
Tower, this is N-141.

903
01:14:53,798 --> 01:14:55,558
申请着陆运送货物。完毕
Request to land for a freight delivery. Over.

904
01:14:55,624 --> 01:15:00,060
嗯,n - 141, -。我们被告知你们携带了未经授权的乘客。完毕。
Uh, N-141, negative. We've been advised you're carrying unauthorized passengers. Over.

905
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:01,503
收到，塔台。
Copy that, tower.

906
01:15:01,638 --> 01:15:03,800
请告知货物易腐烂。
Be advised shipment is perishable.

907
01:15:03,935 --> 01:15:05,301
我们需要立即批准。
We need immediate clearance.

908
01:15:05,436 --> 01:15:07,907
-紧急情况，完毕。——没有……不。
- It's an emergency. Over. - There isn't... No.

909
01:15:08,042 --> 01:15:10,346
呃,负面的。回到原点。
Uh, negative. Return to point of origin.

910
01:15:10,481 --> 01:15:11,943
你们好像要分手了。
Uh, you seem to be breaking up.

911
01:15:12,078 --> 01:15:13,478
你听到我说的话了吗?
Are-are you hearing me on your side?

912
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,884
不错的尝试,凯拉。他们会击落你的鸟。
Nice try, Kayla. They will down your bird.

913
01:15:18,917 --> 01:15:20,955
这是谁?这是丹尼斯?
Who is this? Is this Denise?

914
01:15:21,091 --> 01:15:23,422
你不会想让我泄露秘密的，丹尼斯。
You do not want me to start spilling secrets, Denise.

915
01:15:23,558 --> 01:15:25,093
你记得杜布罗夫尼克。
You remember Dubrovnik.

916
01:15:26,727 --> 01:15:29,790
她的……不同的丹尼斯。
She's... Different Denise.

917
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:31,799
在账户。
In accounts.

918
01:15:38,902 --> 01:15:40,505
桑托斯交谈。
Talked to Santos.

919
01:15:40,641 --> 01:15:42,139
是那个女孩的父母。
It's the girl's parents.

920
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:47,181
嘘，关掉广告。
Sh-Shut off the ADS.

921
01:15:47,316 --> 01:15:49,181
你确定吗?
You sure?

922
01:15:49,317 --> 01:15:51,280
啊哈。
Uh-huh.

923
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:58,623
那是什么?
What's that?

924
01:15:58,758 --> 01:16:02,397
呃，那是…那是空中威慑系统。
Uh, that's the, uh... that's the aerial deterrent system.

925
01:16:02,533 --> 01:16:03,726
让空中生命远离我们。
Keeps the airborne life away.

926
01:16:03,862 --> 01:16:05,527
它为什么在闪烁?
Why is it blinking?

927
01:16:05,663 --> 01:16:07,473
因为在塔里的混蛋丹尼斯把它关掉了。
Because dead-ass Denise in the tower just turned it off.

928
01:16:07,497 --> 01:16:09,257
我们得马上离开这片空域。
We got to get out of this airspace right now.

929
01:16:14,043 --> 01:16:16,970
-那是另一架飞机，对吧?——不是。
- That's another plane, right? - Not exactly.

930
01:16:20,011 --> 01:16:23,047
这是一个……Quetzalcoatlus。
Is that a... Quetzalcoatlus.

931
01:16:23,182 --> 01:16:25,319
晚白垩世。应该呆在那里。
Late Cretaceous. Should've stayed there.

932
01:16:31,525 --> 01:16:33,925
好吧。好吧。
Okay. Okay.

933
01:16:34,061 --> 01:16:36,063
它很酷。我们很好。这是一去不复返了。
It's cool. We're good. It's gone.

934
01:16:53,409 --> 01:16:54,849
这架飞机要坠毁了。
This plane is going down.

935
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:57,950
如果你要弹出来，现在就得弹。
If you're going to eject, you need to do it now.

936
01:16:58,086 --> 01:17:00,087
我只有一把椅子，她就坐在里面。
I only got one chair, and she's in it.

937
01:17:00,223 --> 01:17:02,857
-你没有降落伞?-我没想到会有人。
- You don't have parachutes? - I wasn't expecting company.

938
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:12,227
克莱尔。
Claire.

939
01:17:12,362 --> 01:17:13,860
我们得让你下飞机。
We got to get you off this plane.

940
01:17:13,995 --> 01:17:15,263
什么?
What?

941
01:17:15,398 --> 01:17:16,717
降落伞会自动打开。
Parachute is gonna open automatically.

942
01:17:16,741 --> 01:17:17,912
如果没有，你就拉动这个控制杆。
If it doesn't, you pull this lever.

943
01:17:17,936 --> 01:17:18,936
你明白我的意思吗?
Do you understand me?

944
01:17:19,068 --> 01:17:20,642
克莱尔!
Claire!

945
01:17:20,778 --> 01:17:24,183
如果它不能自动打开，你就拉动你身后的控制杆，好吗?
If it doesn't open automatically, you're gonna pull this lever here behind you, okay?

946
01:17:24,207 --> 01:17:26,144
——10000英尺!-嗨。
- 10,000 feet! - Hey.

947
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:27,827
你才是那个要去救她的人。
You're the one who's got to go to get to her.

948
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:29,884
你是她的妈妈。你是她唯一的机会。
You're her mom. You're her only shot.

949
01:17:32,786 --> 01:17:34,856
我们会再见的。
I'll see you again.

950
01:17:36,022 --> 01:17:38,189
我爱你。
I love you.

951
01:18:26,937 --> 01:18:27,937
有什么计划吗?
What's the plan?

952
01:18:28,005 --> 01:18:29,607
无论发生什么。
Whatever happens.

953
01:18:29,742 --> 01:18:31,440
这就是计划。
That's the plan.

954
01:18:45,191 --> 01:18:46,825
三。…就是这样。
...Three. ...That's it.

955
01:18:46,961 --> 01:18:48,727
艾伦，我们需要密码。
Alan, we need the code.

956
01:18:48,862 --> 01:18:49,994
我们来试试这个。
Let's try this thing.

957
01:18:50,129 --> 01:18:51,361
是的。
Yeah.

958
01:18:51,496 --> 01:18:53,198
艾莉下来。
ELLIE Get down.

959
01:18:58,842 --> 01:19:02,537
-谢天谢地是你-我不知道…这地方真像个迷宫。
- Thank God it's you. - I don't know... This place is such a maze.

960
01:19:02,672 --> 01:19:04,023
-我们很困惑。-你能来真好。
- We were so confused. - It's good you're here.

961
01:19:04,047 --> 01:19:08,928
但我以为我们迷路了，然后你说第三站，我就想…-我们以为你说…你有样品吗?
But I thought we were straight-up lost, then you said station three, and I was like... - We thought you said... - Do you have the sample?

962
01:19:08,952 --> 01:19:10,981
——什么?-你在说什么?
- What? - What are you talking about?

963
01:19:11,116 --> 01:19:12,822
DNA样本…你有吗?
The DNA sample... do you have it?

964
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:15,417
生物合成技术导致了蝗灾
Biosyn's responsible for the locust epidemic.

965
01:19:15,553 --> 01:19:17,131
道奇森在掩盖事实。你是对的。
Dodgson's covering it up. You were right.

966
01:19:17,155 --> 01:19:19,151
我是来帮你的。
I'm-I'm here to help you.

967
01:19:19,286 --> 01:19:20,858
你有吗?
Do you have it?

968
01:19:20,994 --> 01:19:22,263
——嗯…-是的。
- Uh... - Yeah.

969
01:19:22,398 --> 01:19:23,495
好。
Good.

970
01:19:24,398 --> 01:19:26,207
这个吊舱会直接带你去机场。
This pod will take you straight to the airfield.

971
01:19:26,231 --> 01:19:27,835
我们有一架飞机准备起飞。
We have a plane ready to fly.

972
01:19:27,971 --> 01:19:29,370
伊恩跟你说了六足动物联盟的事?
Ian told you about Hexapod Allies?

973
01:19:29,505 --> 01:19:31,571
不。我告诉他。
No. I told him.

974
01:19:31,707 --> 01:19:33,171
什么?
What?

975
01:19:33,307 --> 01:19:35,372
-好了，你们得走了——等待。
- Okay, you guys got to go. - - Wait.

976
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:41,048
梅齐。
Maisie.

977
01:19:44,487 --> 01:19:45,745
梅齐洛克伍德。
Maisie Lockwood.

978
01:19:48,754 --> 01:19:50,024
走了。
Go.

979
01:24:04,574 --> 01:24:06,247
那是我的宝贝。
That was my baby.

980
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:16,723
你在哪儿学的飞行?
Where'd you learn to fly?

981
01:24:16,859 --> 01:24:18,727
呃,空军。
Uh, Air Force.

982
01:24:18,863 --> 01:24:20,221
这是我妈妈的遗产。
Legacy on my mama's side.

983
01:24:20,356 --> 01:24:21,955
是的。我是海军。
Yeah. I'm Navy.

984
01:24:22,958 --> 01:24:24,859
那么，你是怎么做到的呢?
And so, how'd you end up doing this?

985
01:24:24,994 --> 01:24:33,003
我是一名合法的飞行员，但我没付那么多钱来这里把钱寄回家，所以我找了几个熟人做了些更赚钱的见不得光的事。
I was a legit contract pilot for a grip, but didn't exactly pay enough to be out here and send the money home, so I hit up a few contacts for the more lucrative shady shit.

986
01:24:34,807 --> 01:24:37,010
说实话，我可能不想干这行了。
Honestly, I might be done with this line of work.

987
01:24:37,146 --> 01:24:38,877
这就是你帮我们的原因吗
Is that why you're helping us?

988
01:24:42,342 --> 01:24:45,121
他们把你女儿交给生物合成人时我就在现场。
I was there when they handed your girl off to Biosyn.

989
01:24:46,322 --> 01:24:49,682
我本可以说点什么，但我没有。
I could've said something, but I didn't.

990
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:51,853
当我看到她的照片时
And when I saw her picture...

991
01:24:53,965 --> 01:24:55,696
光无所事事是不够的。
It isn't enough to do nothing.

992
01:25:01,067 --> 01:25:02,534
谢谢你！
Thank you.

993
01:25:48,951 --> 01:25:50,846
不。
No.

994
01:25:55,252 --> 01:25:56,252
不。
Nope.

995
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:22,317
什么一个混蛋。
What an asshole.

996
01:27:13,331 --> 01:27:14,695
你好吗?
You good?

997
01:27:14,831 --> 01:27:16,169
是的。是的，是的，是的，是的。
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

998
01:27:16,304 --> 01:27:17,629
是啊，我一点都不震惊。你吗?
Yeah, I'm not shook at all. You?

999
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:19,803
不。不,不。
Nah. Nah, no.

1000
01:27:21,641 --> 01:27:23,540
弹射座椅信标。
The ejection seat beacon.

1001
01:27:23,675 --> 01:27:26,145
-我们会找到她的——好的。好吧。
- We'll find her. - Okay. Okay.

1002
01:27:26,281 --> 01:27:28,141
你真的爱她，是吗?
You really love her, huh?

1003
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:31,148
是的。
Yeah.

1004
01:27:31,283 --> 01:27:32,783
我明白了。
I get it.

1005
01:27:33,848 --> 01:27:35,720
我也喜欢红头发的。
I like redheads, too.

1006
01:27:36,717 --> 01:27:38,486
什么?神。
What? God.

1007
01:27:41,832 --> 01:27:42,889
那是谁?
Who is that?

1008
01:27:43,025 --> 01:27:44,891
是格兰特和萨特勒。
It's Grant and Sattler.

1009
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:47,026
-这是直播吗?- 12分钟前。
- Is this live? - 12 minutes ago.

1010
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:48,760
我们在追踪逃跑的线人。
We were tracking the escaped asset.

1011
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:50,196
我们的人错过了。
Our guys missed it.

1012
01:27:50,332 --> 01:27:52,300
他们偷了一份DNA样本。
They stole a DNA sample.

1013
01:27:53,303 --> 01:27:55,383
-他们怎么进去的?-他们用了门禁钥匙。
- How'd they get in there? - They used an access key.

1014
01:27:55,408 --> 01:27:57,542
洋基白色的间隙。
Yankee White clearance.

1015
01:27:57,677 --> 01:28:01,883
我们的一个摄像头拍到伊恩·马尔科姆在塞特勒的口袋里放了东西。
One of our cameras saw Ian Malcolm put something in Sattler's pocket.

1016
01:28:02,019 --> 01:28:04,050
好吧。
All right.

1017
01:28:04,185 --> 01:28:05,550
我要见他。
I want to see him.

1018
01:28:05,685 --> 01:28:08,186
把拉姆齐也叫上来，好吗?
And get Ramsay up here, too, will you?

1019
01:28:08,322 --> 01:28:09,588
他们现在在哪里?
Where are they now?

1020
01:28:09,723 --> 01:28:11,624
在去机场的路上。
On the way to the airfield.

1021
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,725
他们准时赶上了超级高铁。
They caught the hyperloop right on schedule.

1022
01:28:19,936 --> 01:28:21,896
你好吗?
How are you?

1023
01:28:22,031 --> 01:28:23,867
你对吧?
You all right?

1024
01:28:24,875 --> 01:28:26,408
实际上不是这样的。
Not really, no.

1025
01:28:28,372 --> 01:28:30,110
嘿。
Hey.

1026
01:28:30,245 --> 01:28:32,744
我认识你妈妈。
I, uh, knew your mom.

1027
01:28:36,116 --> 01:28:37,245
你做了吗?
You did?

1028
01:28:37,381 --> 01:28:38,915
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

1029
01:28:40,249 --> 01:28:49,931
哈蒙德死后几年，她来我的大学讲课，然后…我们成了好朋友。
Yeah, a few years after Hammond died, she came to my university to lecture, and... we became good friends.

1030
01:28:50,066 --> 01:28:51,800
她长什么样?
What was she like?

1031
01:28:51,935 --> 01:28:53,235
辉煌。
Brilliant.

1032
01:28:53,371 --> 01:28:55,067
比其他所有人都领先好几光年。
Light-years ahead of everybody else.

1033
01:28:56,734 --> 01:28:58,407
她有良知。
And she had a conscience.

1034
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:04,809
在他们建造主题公园的时候，她决心要证明基因的力量可以拯救生命。
While they were out building theme parks, well, she was determined to prove that genetic power could save lives.

1035
01:29:06,106 --> 01:29:07,682
我就是她的实验品。
And I was her experiment.

1036
01:29:07,818 --> 01:29:09,275
不。
No.

1037
01:29:11,379 --> 01:29:13,380
她想要个孩子胜过一切。
She wanted a child more than anything.

1038
01:29:14,317 --> 01:29:17,558
但她想让你得到她得不到的东西。
But she wanted you to have what she couldn't.

1039
01:29:18,555 --> 01:29:20,319
一个完整的人生。
A full life.

1040
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:25,093
我认识她的时间不长。
I didn't know her long.

1041
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:28,261
但我知道她非常爱你。
But I know she loved you very much.

1042
01:29:48,490 --> 01:29:49,953
发生什么事情了?
What's happening?

1043
01:29:54,928 --> 01:29:57,294
这一定是古老的琥珀矿。
This must be the old amber mines.

1044
01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:01,965
他们在建造这些隧道时一定造了通道门。
They must have made access doors when they built these tunnels.

1045
01:30:26,195 --> 01:30:27,595
嘿。
Hey.

1046
01:30:27,730 --> 01:30:30,026
我听到了警报。一切都好吧?
I heard the alarm. Everything all right?

1047
01:30:30,162 --> 01:30:32,431
是的,不,不。没有我们处理不了的事。
Yeah, no, no. Nothing we can't, uh, handle.

1048
01:30:32,566 --> 01:30:34,168
-听…——你响了吗?
- Listen... - You rang?

1049
01:30:34,303 --> 01:30:35,894
哦,很好。马尔科姆博士。
Oh, good. Dr. Malcolm.

1050
01:30:36,029 --> 01:30:38,202
你是…解雇。
You are... fired.

1051
01:30:38,337 --> 01:30:39,898
什么?
What?

1052
01:30:40,034 --> 01:30:43,238
那是一份轻松的工作。
It was such a cushy gig.

1053
01:30:43,373 --> 01:30:48,245
你可以把你的门禁钥匙给我，如果你还有的话。
You can, uh, give your access key to security, if you still have it.

1054
01:30:48,381 --> 01:30:49,822
一个超级高铁舱刚刚在琥珀矿关闭了。
One of the hyperloop pods just shut down in the amber mines.

1055
01:30:49,846 --> 01:30:51,344
什么?
What?

1056
01:30:52,353 --> 01:30:54,618
哇。这一天。
Wow. This day.

1057
01:30:54,753 --> 01:31:00,526
呃,这……我们是哪个舱…还有,嗯……恐龙在矿井里?
Uh, which... which pod are we... Are there, um... dinosaurs in the mines?

1058
01:31:00,661 --> 01:31:02,191
到处都是恐龙。
There are dinosaurs everywhere.

1059
01:31:02,327 --> 01:31:03,507
我是说，严格来说，鸟类就是恐龙。
I mean, you know, technically, birds are dinosaurs.

1060
01:31:03,531 --> 01:31:06,646
Ge-Genetically说话……好了，路易斯，格兰特和萨特勒在舱里。
Ge-Genetically speaking... Okay, Lewis, Grant and Sattler are in this pod.

1061
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:08,405
我们得尽快派一队安保人员过去。
We need to send a security team out there ASAP.

1062
01:31:08,429 --> 01:31:10,132
好吧。当然,拉姆齐。谢谢你！
Okay. Absolutely, Ramsay. Thank you.

1063
01:31:10,267 --> 01:31:12,298
不过我们还是各就各位吧。
Uh, let's all just stay in our lanes, though.

1064
01:31:12,434 --> 01:31:14,476
我们会处理好的。谢谢你,医生。
We can take care of it. Thank you, Doctor.

1065
01:31:14,612 --> 01:31:16,975
就是这样,不是吗?没有别的可看的了吗?
That's it, huh? Nothing else to see here?

1066
01:31:17,110 --> 01:31:20,405
我不太喜欢你现在的语气。
Uh, I'm not sure I admire your tone right now.

1067
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:22,716
-你得走了-是的，我喜欢。
- You need to leave. - - Yeah, I do.

1068
01:31:22,852 --> 01:31:26,148
但首先，我欠这些人一个道歉。
But first, I owe all these folks an apology.

1069
01:31:26,283 --> 01:31:31,917
我认为，借由我的声望来经营这家公司，我可能会让Biosyn公司看起来并没有彻底腐烂。
I think that by lending my cachet to this joint I might have made it seem as if Biosyn wasn't rotten to the core.

1070
01:31:32,053 --> 01:31:33,151
这就够了,伊恩。
That's enough, Ian.

1071
01:31:33,287 --> 01:31:34,447
看，他们是这样抓到你的。
See, here's how they get you.

1072
01:31:34,529 --> 01:31:39,407
他们会在短时间内给你很多升职机会，这会削弱你的批判性思维能力。
They give you so many promotions in a short period of time that it bludgeons your capacity for critical thinking.

1073
01:31:39,431 --> 01:31:43,838
-我的天啊-所以有些门你没有打开，有些事你忽略了。
- Oh, my God. - So then there are doors that you don't open, things that you ignore.

1074
01:31:43,974 --> 01:31:49,139
但他主要是在利用你的魅力。
But mainly, he's exploiting your enchantment with these.

1075
01:31:49,274 --> 01:31:55,443
这是真正的问题吗，还是你只是…你在加速我们物种的灭绝，而你却不在乎。
Is there an actual concern here, or are you just... You're racing toward the extinction of our species, and you don't care.

1076
01:31:55,579 --> 01:31:58,184
你很清楚自己在做什么，但你不会停下来。
You know exactly what you're doing, but you won't stop.

1077
01:31:58,319 --> 01:31:59,753
你不能。
You can't.

1078
01:31:59,888 --> 01:32:03,084
我以为你会与众不同，但你和其他人一样。
You know, I thought you might be different, but you're just like everyone else.

1079
01:32:03,218 --> 01:32:04,490

01:47:09,164 --> 01:47:11,228
猎物。
Giganotosaurus.

1219
01:47:13,570 --> 01:47:15,734
世界上最大的食肉动物
Biggest carnivore the world has ever seen.

1220
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:36,055
麦茜，麦茜，看着我。
Maisie, Maisie, look at me.

1221
01:47:36,190 --> 01:47:37,690
看着我。
Look at me.

1222
01:48:17,092 --> 01:48:18,896
-快，快，快。——加油!
- Go, go, go, go. - Come on!

1223
01:48:23,462 --> 01:48:25,896
.．.不,不,不!不!
...No, no, no! No!

1224
01:48:30,412 --> 01:48:32,413
——喧嚣。-我要死了!
- Hustle. - I'm gonna die!

1225
01:48:32,549 --> 01:48:34,110
——爬。爬,孩子。——不!
- Climb. Climb, kid. - No!

1226
01:48:34,245 --> 01:48:36,617
你不是。不,你不是。你是好的。
You're not. No, you're not. You're okay.

1227
01:48:45,055 --> 01:48:47,192
走，走，走，走，走。
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1228
01:49:03,672 --> 01:49:05,470
来吧。
Come on.

1229
01:49:06,444 --> 01:49:07,945
嘿。
Hey.

1230
01:49:14,323 --> 01:49:16,283
哦,是的。到这里来。
Oh, yeah. Come here.

1231
01:49:32,973 --> 01:49:35,302
-快，快，快。-帮我打开。帮帮我。
- Go, go, go. - Help me open it. Help me out.

1232
01:49:39,709 --> 01:49:41,541
我得到了丫。
I got ya.

1233
01:49:42,811 --> 01:49:44,184
走,走,走。
Go, go, go.

1234
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,851
走，走，走，走，走!
Go, go, go, go, go!

1235
01:49:48,453 --> 01:49:49,514
跑
Run.

1236
01:50:06,175 --> 01:50:08,038
看到了吗?不那么糟糕。
See? Not so bad.

1237
01:50:14,578 --> 01:50:15,872
来吧。
Come on.

1238
01:50:17,517 --> 01:50:19,082
克莱尔!
Claire!

1239
01:51:01,089 --> 01:51:02,960
调用一个疏散。
Call an evacuation.

1240
01:51:03,095 --> 01:51:05,062
我们得把动物带进去。
We need to bring the animals inside.

1241
01:51:05,198 --> 01:51:09,099
规定很明确，如果是二级……——嘘!
The regulations are clear that in the event - of a level two... - Shh!

1242
01:51:10,403 --> 01:51:11,970
杰弗里。
Jeffrey.

1243
01:51:17,311 --> 01:51:21,139
神……-…该死的!——哦。
God... - ...damn it! - Oh.

1244
01:51:22,449 --> 01:51:26,312
只是…就叫它。
Just... Just call it.

1245
01:51:26,448 --> 01:51:28,579
注意,注意。
Attention, attention.

1246
01:51:28,715 --> 01:51:30,855
这是紧急疏散令。
This is an immediate evacuation order.

1247
01:51:30,991 --> 01:51:33,091
远程放牧系统现已激活。
Remote herding system is now active.

1248
01:51:33,226 --> 01:51:36,428
所有活着的人正在前往紧急隔离区
All living assets en route to emergency containment.

1249
01:51:59,319 --> 01:52:03,791
找不到人了，因为一切都着火了。
Can't get hold of anybody since everything is, uh, on fire.

1250
01:52:03,926 --> 01:52:06,293
-萨特勒医生，拿点水来——哦。谢谢。
- Dr. Sattler, get some water. - Oh. Thanks.

1251
01:52:06,429 --> 01:52:08,461
格兰特博士吗?给你。
Dr. Grant? Here you are.

1252
01:52:08,597 --> 01:52:10,221
我,呃…我是欧文Grady。
I'm, uh... I'm Owen Grady.

1253
01:52:10,357 --> 01:52:11,991
大风扇。我读了你的书。
Big fan. I read your book.

1254
01:52:12,127 --> 01:52:13,564
嗯，录下来。
Well, book on tape.

1255
01:52:13,700 --> 01:52:15,963
欧文·格雷迪，欧文·格雷迪。
Owen Grady, Owen Grady.

1256
01:52:16,099 --> 01:52:18,168
我知道你是谁。
Yeah, I know who you are.

1257
01:52:18,303 --> 01:52:20,900
-你训练过猛禽。-是的。
- You trained raptors. - Yeah.

1258
01:52:21,036 --> 01:52:23,001
我试过了。是的。
I tried. Yeah.

1259
01:52:23,137 --> 01:52:24,501
你过得如何?
How you doing?

1260
01:52:24,637 --> 01:52:26,339
这里的一个。
The one here.

1261
01:52:26,475 --> 01:52:28,305
你,嗯…你在侏罗纪世界。
You, uh... you were at Jurassic World.

1262
01:52:28,441 --> 01:52:29,910
侏罗纪世界?
Jurassic World?

1263
01:52:30,045 --> 01:52:32,677
我不喜欢
Not a fan. Mm-mm.

1264
01:52:33,714 --> 01:52:35,979
好了，我们能找到出去的路了吗?
Okay, so we good to find a way out of here?

1265
01:52:36,115 --> 01:52:37,182
是的。
Yep.

1266
01:52:37,318 --> 01:52:38,993
让我们得到它。
Let's get it.

1267
01:52:39,128 --> 01:52:42,223
主楼里有一架直升机。
There's a helicopter out in the main complex.

1268
01:52:42,359 --> 01:52:44,724
我们把广告打开，然后回家。
We turn the ADS back on, we go home.

1269
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:47,531
.．.等等，什么是广告?-空中威慑系统。
...Wait, what's an ADS? - Aerial deterrent system.

1270
01:52:47,666 --> 01:52:51,562
哦,嗯…你知道的，为了翼手龙什么的。
Oh, uh... You know, for the pterodactyls and shit.

1271
01:52:51,698 --> 01:52:53,046
让他们远离直升机。
Keeps them away from the helicopters.

1272
01:52:53,070 --> 01:52:55,203
那我们怎么把它打开?
Well, how do we turn it back on?

1273
01:52:55,339 --> 01:52:59,772
好吧，看起来所有的系统都通到三楼的控制室。
Okay, it looks like all the systems run through to the control room, which is on the third floor.

1274
01:52:59,908 --> 01:53:01,343
哦。
Oh.

1275
01:53:01,479 --> 01:53:03,477
这些前哨都连接在地下。
These outposts are all connected underground.

1276
01:53:08,854 --> 01:53:10,686
好了，冷静点，兰博。
All right, easy, Rambo.

1277
01:53:21,102 --> 01:53:23,266
你在猛禽监狱工作过，是吗?
So you worked in the raptor pen, huh?

1278
01:53:24,236 --> 01:53:26,071
-是的。-哇，然后呢?
- Yeah. - Wow, and what-what happens?

1279
01:53:26,207 --> 01:53:30,802
你是直接告诉他们该怎么做，然后他们…他们遵守或者…?
Do you just tell 'em what to do, and they, uh... they comply or...?

1280
01:53:30,938 --> 01:53:34,546
这是建立在相互尊重基础上的人类和动物之间的纽带。
Well, it's a human/animal bond based on mutual respect.

1281
01:53:34,681 --> 01:53:36,910
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

1282
01:53:37,045 --> 01:53:39,416
我曾经养过一只狗。
Had a dog once.

1283
01:53:39,552 --> 01:53:43,918
我的腿蹭得太厉害，我…我的胫骨上长了一块老茧。
Humped my leg so much, I... I got a callous on my shinbone.

1284
01:53:44,054 --> 01:53:45,618
这是一个真实的故事。
That's a true story.

1285
01:53:58,098 --> 01:53:59,603
哦,上帝。
Oh, God.

1286
01:53:59,738 --> 01:54:01,909
嘿。好。
Hey. Good.

1287
01:54:02,909 --> 01:54:04,338
我是这么想的。
Here's what I'm thinking.

1288
01:54:04,474 --> 01:54:07,237
我们重新开始，你和我。
We get started again, you and me.

1289
01:54:07,372 --> 01:54:09,477
我能弄到钱。
I can get money.

1290
01:54:10,445 --> 01:54:11,781
是啊，现在钱很便宜。
Yeah, money's cheap these days.

1291
01:54:11,917 --> 01:54:13,149
什么回事?
What-what's the matter?

1292
01:54:13,285 --> 01:54:17,517
别那么担心。有……机会无处不在。
Don't look so worried. There's... There's opportunity in everything.

1293
01:54:17,653 --> 01:54:19,691
e。你你会知道。
E-Even this. You'll-you'll learn that.

1294
01:54:19,827 --> 01:54:24,289
我一直在想…也许你现在更能主导，好吗?
I've been thinking, um... Maybe you take more of a lead now, okay?

1295
01:54:24,424 --> 01:54:26,696
我想你准备好了。
You're ready, I think.

1296
01:54:26,832 --> 01:54:30,234
在这里,把…你到底是怎么回事?
Here, take... What the hell is the matter with you?

1297
01:54:39,404 --> 01:54:40,805
这是你。
It was you.

1298
01:54:41,842 --> 01:54:48,385
你跟马尔科姆说了那个项目。你,你……这一切都是你安排的?你陷害我?
You told Malcolm about the program. You-you... You set this whole thing up? You set me up?

1299
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:57,360
我给了你所有我没有的机会。我…我们已经达成共识，拉姆齐，你不能违背。
I gave you every opportunity I did not have. I... We have an understanding, Ramsay, and you do not break that.

1300
01:54:59,866 --> 01:55:01,760
我不会打破这个。
I would not break this.

1301
01:55:04,704 --> 01:55:06,369
我不是你。
I'm not you.

1302
01:55:20,986 --> 01:55:23,221
哦，这太糟糕了。
Oh, this is very bad.

1303
01:55:24,852 --> 01:55:26,926
这和我们在公园里用的系统是一样的。
This is the same system we used at the park.

1304
01:55:27,062 --> 01:55:31,831
太好了，所以我们可以，呃，打开…那件事，然后我们就都离开这里?
Great, so we can, uh, turn on the... the thing, and then we all get out of here?

1305
01:55:31,967 --> 01:55:37,330
让我们来看看。广告……这是什么?错误99是什么?
Let's see. ADS... What's this? What-what's error 99?

1306
01:55:37,466 --> 01:55:38,896
没有足够的力量。
Not enough power.

1307
01:55:39,031 --> 01:55:43,208
在故障发生时，主系统会占用所有可用的电力来维持运行。
In a breakdown, all available power is seized by the primary system to keep running.

1308
01:55:43,344 --> 01:55:45,211
我们需要所有的能量来激活ADS。
We need all that power to reactivate the ADS.

1309
01:55:45,347 --> 01:55:47,456
所以这个系统的安全功能就是杀死我们的东西吗?
So the system's safety feature is what's gonna kill us?

1310
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:49,711
——当然。-我们怎么才能得到更多的能量?
- Of course. - How do we get more power?

1311
01:55:49,847 --> 01:55:54,744
我们不能，但我们可以重新分配，只要我们…只需要…关闭主系统。
Uh, well, we can't, but we can redistribute what we have if we just... just need to... Shut down the primary system.

1312
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:56,420
——是的,没错。-在哪里?
- Yes, exactly. - Where is it?

1313
01:55:56,556 --> 01:55:58,166
.．.下一层。-我和你一起去。
...Uh, next floor up. - I'm coming with you.

1314
01:55:58,190 --> 01:55:59,686
我们逃到了这里。
We escaped down here.

1315
01:56:00,721 --> 01:56:02,201
那是哪儿?水处理中心。
Where is that? Water treatment center.

1316
01:56:02,328 --> 01:56:04,394
水电系统……子八。
Hydroelectric system... Sub eight.

1317
01:56:04,529 --> 01:56:06,098
给我八分钟，我能找到她。
Give me eight minutes, I could find her.

1318
01:56:06,233 --> 01:56:08,362
-等等，这是谁?——β。
- Wait, who's this now? - - Beta.

1319
01:56:08,498 --> 01:56:10,428
——蓝色的婴儿。——迅猛龙。
- Blue's baby. - Velociraptor.

1320
01:56:10,563 --> 01:56:12,598
——什么?-小迅猛龙?
- What? - A baby raptor?

1321
01:56:12,734 --> 01:56:14,402
你给了她一个名字。你觉得怎么样?
And you gave her a name. How about that?

1322
01:56:14,538 --> 01:56:16,272
我答应过要带她回家的。
I made a promise we would bring her home.

1323
01:56:16,408 --> 01:56:19,240
你答应了一只恐龙。
You made a promise to a dinosaur.

1324
01:56:19,376 --> 01:56:20,944
你和我们一起去，对吗?
You're coming with us, right?

1325
01:56:21,079 --> 01:56:23,875
梅齐,我…请。
Maisie, I... Please.

1326
01:56:26,722 --> 01:56:28,149
我在第五频道。
I'll be on channel five.

1327
01:56:28,285 --> 01:56:29,751
——好的。-数到三。
- Okay. - We're on three.

1328
01:56:31,417 --> 01:56:32,851
回来了。
Come back.

1329
01:56:33,861 --> 01:56:35,062
我总会回来的。
I always come back.

1330
01:56:36,630 --> 01:56:39,033
我十分钟后让直升机起飞。等我的信号。
I'll have that chopper hot in ten. Wait for my signal.

1331
01:56:40,896 --> 01:56:43,135
DENISE撤离第四阶段完成。
DENISE Evacuation phase four complete.

1332
01:56:43,271 --> 01:56:45,468
所有活着的人都被隔离了
All living assets now in containment.

1333
01:56:54,274 --> 01:56:55,445
来吧。
Come on.

1334
01:57:07,820 --> 01:57:09,452
仍然会做噩梦吗?
Still get nightmares?

1335
01:57:09,588 --> 01:57:11,826
所有的时间。
All the time.

1336
01:57:11,962 --> 01:57:13,430
你吗?
You?

1337
01:57:14,429 --> 01:57:16,261
我有很多遗憾。
I have a lot of regrets.

1338
01:57:16,396 --> 01:57:17,764
噢,是吗?
Oh, yeah?

1339
01:57:19,002 --> 01:57:24,243
嗯…我们坚持遗憾，我们停留在过去。
Well... we hold on to regret, we stay in the past.

1340
01:57:27,443 --> 01:57:32,452
我想，重要的是... ...就是我们现在所做的。
What matters, I guess, is... ...is what we do now.

1341
01:57:32,587 --> 01:57:33,651
对吧?
Right?

1342
01:57:33,786 --> 01:57:35,012
是的。
Yeah.

1343
01:57:52,471 --> 01:57:54,438
没人说会有虫子。
Nobody said there'd be bugs.

1344
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:59,042
B4。她在这里。
B4. She's in here.

1345
01:57:59,178 --> 01:58:00,979
看两边。
Watch the sides.

1346
01:58:01,114 --> 01:58:03,678
他们总是来自边路。
They always come from the sides.

1347
01:58:05,217 --> 01:58:12,050
你知道，一开始我们以为…它们把猎物开膛破肚，但没有。
You know, at first we thought... they disembowel their prey, but no.

1348
01:58:12,185 --> 01:58:15,354
它们很聪明，会直接攻击对方的喉咙。
They're smart enough to go straight for the throat.

1349
01:58:15,490 --> 01:58:17,791
静脉，动脉。
The veins, the arteries.

1350
01:58:18,824 --> 01:58:20,524
有时两者同时发生。
Sometimes both at the same time.

1351

伊恩我们找到你了。

就在那条过道的尽头。

It's right down that aisle where you are.

1356
01:58:29,539 --> 01:58:32,338

Okay, so it-it'll be a yellow button on a grid of six.

There's a green button. Do you see a green button?

1360
01:58:39,416 --> 01:58:40,614
不是那个绿色按钮。
It's not that green button.

1361
01:58:40,750 --> 01:58:41,833
——这是四……-哪一个是按钮?
- It's four... - which one's the button?

1362

Third one down or fourth one up... same thing.

1366
01:58:47,257 --> 01:58:48,591
伊恩,要具体。
Ian, be specific.

1367

灯。
Lights off.

1369

I don't know how I could possibly be more specific other than to say that the one you want is marked with... - E1. - E1. E1.

1370
01:59:10,082 --> 01:59:12,615
E1。

我得打她的脖子侧面。
I've got to hit her on the side of her neck.

1377
01:59:43,813 --> 01:59:46,018
麦茜，你要抓住她的注意力。
Maisie, you're gonna hold her focus.

1378
01:59:46,153 --> 01:59:48,948
格兰特,我们呈三角形。
Grant, we're triangulating.

1379

走了。

1380
02:00:24,851 --> 02:00:26,282
对不起,女孩。
Sorry, girl.

1381
02:00:27,319 --> 02:00:29,428
我答应过你妈妈送你回家的。

不，它不应该这样。

在这里,把这个。

1388
02:01:06,898 --> 02:01:08,212

我们会成功的。
We're-we're gonna make it work.

02:02:59,639 --> 02:03:01,145
等等!
Wait!

求你了，你得听我说。

你制造了一场生态灾难。

我可以解决它。

02:04:05,309 --> 02:04:08,740
夏洛特·洛克伍德改变了梅奇身体里的每一个细胞。
Charlotte Lockwood changed every cell in Maisie's body.

1412
02:04:08,875 --> 02:04:10,683
它救了她的命。
It saved her life.

1413
02:04:10,818 --> 02:04:19,526
如果我能理解夏洛特是如何改写麦奇的DNA的，我就能在为时已晚之前把改变从一只蝗虫传播到整个蝗虫群。
If I can understand how Charlotte rewrote Maisie's DNA, I can spread change from one locust to the entire swarm before it's too late.

1414
02:04:21,361 --> 02:04:24,256
没关系。没关系。

不是他。
Not him.

1421
02:04:40,744 --> 02:04:42,278
不是他。总是他。
Not him. It's always him.

1422
02:04:42,413 --> 02:04:46,850
每一个如果……你肩膀上是一只恐龙吗?
Every si... Is that a dinosaur on your shoulder?

1423
02:04:47,847 --> 02:04:49,880
是的。为什么?

珂拉，我有空气了。到中心来见我。
KAYLA I have air. Meet me at the center.

这样做……不要降落在这里。
D-Do... do not land in here.

1427
02:04:56,458 --> 02:04:58,004
我没得选，伙计。山谷不安全。
I don't have a choice, dude. The valley isn't safe.

1428
02:04:58,028 --> 02:05:00,259
不，他们不在山谷里了!
No, they're not in the valley anymore!

1429

快，快，快，快。

不，是每一个层面。

管理层完全的系统性腐败。

他们让我们正确地看待问题。
They really put us in perspective.

The idea that life on Earth existed 65 million years ago... ...it's humbling.
