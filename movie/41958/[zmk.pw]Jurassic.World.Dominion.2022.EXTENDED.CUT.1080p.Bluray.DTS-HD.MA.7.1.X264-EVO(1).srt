让我出去!
Let me out!

13
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,049
保持稳定！
Keep it steady!

14
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:14,356
该死的，我看不出来。你看到了吗？
Damn, I don't see it. Do you see it?

15
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,067
安定下来，孩子。她不能永远跑。
Settle down, kid. She can't run forever.

16
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:37,213
恐龙就在我们的世界里。
Dinosaurs are in our world.

17
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:41,050
随着每一次对抗，我们都会更多地了解这个可怕的新现实。
And with every confrontation, we learn
more about this frightening new reality.

18
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,346
我们怎麽到这儿来的?
How did we get here?

19
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,056
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

20
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,643
自侏罗纪公园的致命事件以来，已经过去了三十年
It's been three decades
since the deadly events at Jurassic Park,

21
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:53,896
我们还没有找到一种方法让这些动物安全地生活在我们中间。
and we've yet to find a way
for these animals to live safely among us.

22
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,442
在努布拉尔岛长期休眠的火山毁灭性喷发之后
After the devastating eruption
of Isla Nublar's long-dormant volcano,

23
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:01,737
那些幸存下来的人被运送到大陆。
those who survived were transported
to the mainland.

24
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,698
许多较大的捕食者被捕获，
Many of the larger predators
were captured,

25
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:06,867
但剩下的生物散落在这里，
but the remaining creatures
scattered here,

26
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:09,537
在大石国家公园。
in Big Rock National Park.

27
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,165
虽然大多数人留在野外，但那些走向文明的人
While most remained in the wild,
those who made their way to civilization

28
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:15,793
努力适应陌生的条件。
struggled to adapt
to unfamiliar conditions.

29
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:19,797
地方当局警告说，这些动物是不可预测的
Local authorities have warned
the animals are unpredictable,

30
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,716
饥饿时，极度暴力。
and when hungry, extremely violent.

31
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,720
随着恐龙的跨境传播，全球黑市已经兴起。
As the dinosaurs spread across borders,
a global black market has risen.

32
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:30,849
他们不是我们的。走吧，你这个悲伤的，可怜的失败者！
- They're not ours.
- Go on, you sad, pathetic loser!

33
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,978
为了打击非法偷猎者日益增长的威胁
To combat the growing threat
of illegal poachers,

34
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,021
美国国会授予唯一的收藏权
the US Congress awarded
sole collection rights

35
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:39,275
到全球巨头生物科技 遗传学。
to the global giant Biosyn Genetics.

36
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,986
在生物科技，我们致力于这个想法
At Biosyn, we're dedicated to the idea

37
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:46,115
恐龙可以教会我们更多关于自己的知识。
that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves.

38
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:51,787
首席运行官路易斯·道奇森 在义大利的白云石山脉 创建了一个避难所
CEO Lewis Dodgson has created
a sanctuary in Italy's Dolomite Mountains,

39
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,707
他希望在那里研究恐龙的古代免疫系统
where he hopes to study
the dinosaurs' ancient immune systems

40
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,917
具有独特的药物特性。
for unique pharmaceutical properties.

41
00:06:57,001 --> 00:07:00,546
虽然生物科技认为我们可以负责任地处理遗传力量
While Biosyn believes
we can handle genetic power responsibly,

42
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,339
公众仍然持怀疑态度。
the public remains skeptical.

43
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:08,512
一些人指出，这些政府合同导致生物科技的利润大幅飙升。
Some note these government contracts have
led to massive spikes in Biosyn's profits.

44
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:13,225
关于一个神秘失踪的人类克隆体的谣言依然存在，
And rumors persist of a human clone
who mysteriously disappeared,

45
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:14,810
导致全球搜索。
leading to a worldwide search.

46
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:18,397
有些人认为她在基因上与夏洛特·洛克伍德 相同
Some believe she's genetically identical
to Charlotte Lockwood,

47
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,151
侏罗纪公园联合创始人本杰明·洛克伍德的已故女儿。
deceased daughter of Jurassic Park
co-founder, Benjamin Lockwood.

48
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:25,529
现在我们把这些动物从灭绝中带回来了
Now that we brought these animals
back from extinction,

49
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,406
我们能面对后果吗？
can we face the consequences?

50
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,575
我们是否对他们负责
Are we responsible for them,

51
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,161
还是应该让他们自己照顾自己？
or should they be left
to fend for themselves?

52
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,539
随着我们适应不断变化的世界
As we adapt to an ever-changing world,

53
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:38,000
我们必须找到这些问题的答案
we must find answers to these questions,

54
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,502
为了他们的安全以及我们自己的安全。
for their safely as well as for our own.

55
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,718
放手吧！
Let it go!

56
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,262
坚持!
Hold on!

57
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:30,052
我们在非法繁殖设施内。
We are inside
the illegal breeding facility.

58
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,139
幼鱼被关在笼子里，以降低成本。
The juveniles are kept in cages
to keep costs down.

59
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,475
这是中世纪的。
It's medieval.

60
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:41,646
克雷尔。
Claire.

61
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,237
你认为他为什麽与其他人分开？
Why do you think he's separated
from the rest?

62
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:52,408
我认为他不会成功。
I don't think he's gonna make it.

63
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,624
不。你在干什麽？我们可以报告这一点。
No. What are you doing?
We could report this.

64
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,210
DFW 需要几天时间进行调查。
The DFW takes days to investigate.

65
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:05,713
我们现在可以保存这个。
We can save this one now.

66
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,257
没关系。没关系，哥们。
It's okay. It's okay, buddy.

67
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:12,886
好。来吧。
Okay. Here we go.

68
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,768
不。不！
Nope. No!

69
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,937
- 电梯。
- 好。
- Lift.
- Okay.

70
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:23,939
- 支撑头部。

71
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,691
好。是的。
Okay. Yeah.

72
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,669
- 快点!
- 检查右侧。
- Hurry up!
- Check the right side.

73
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,528
- 跟我来。
- 走,走,走。
- With me.
- Go, go, go.

74
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,113
好的，来吧。来吧，我们走吧。
Okay, come on.
Come on, let's go.

75
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,162
- 坚持!
- 什麽?
- Hold on!
- To what?

76
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,680
妈的。
Shit.

77
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,146
克雷尔，我们要被枪杀了！
Claire, we're gonna get shot!

78
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,571
- 不！克雷尔！不，不，克雷尔！
- 天啊。
- No! Claire! No, no, Claire!
- Oh, God.

79
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:22,955
该死。
Oh, shit.

80
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:27,961
大家都好吗？
Everybody good?

81
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:29,755
- 不!
- 不!
- No!
- No!

82
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:43,685
好。好吧，所以我想我们把这个送到 DFW
Okay. Okay, so I think
we get this one to the DFW,

83
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,521
然后我们再次击中它们。
and then we hit them again.

84
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:48,106
是的。是的，你看到了那个滋生地，对吧？
Yeah. Yeah, you saw
that breeding ground, right?

85
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:49,775
我们完成了。
We're done.

86
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:53,278
上周我接到了一个电话。
I got a call last week.

87
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:56,990
这是一项真正的工作，我可以做些什麽来有效地改变事情。
It's a real job, something I can do
to effectively change things.

88
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:59,201
- 我必须接受它。
- 他们需要我们
- I gotta take it.
- They need us.

89
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:02,246
你拯救这些恐龙是因为它们需要我们吗？
Are you saving these dinosaurs
because they need us,

90
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,581
还是你拯救他们来赦免自己？
or are you saving them
to absolve yourself?

91
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,667
克雷尔。我的意思是，这太疯狂了。
- Claire.
- I mean, this is crazy.

92
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,502
克雷尔
Claire,

93
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,587
你正在做正确的事情。
you're doing the right thing.

94
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:14,091
但是这个...这不再是这样做的方式。
But this... This isn't the way
to go about it anymore.

95
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,112
老实说，你需要一个善于被枪杀的人。
Honestly, you need someone
who's good at being shot at.

96
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,974
你和欧文不是还是一件奇怪的事情吗？
Aren't you and Owen still,
like, a weird thing?

97
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,017
- 这并不奇怪。
- 他的意思不是“怪异”。
- It's not that weird.
- He didn't mean "weird."

98
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,644
- 嗯 - 嗯
- 不。
- Mm-mmm.
- No.

99
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,021
呃，他的意思是，就象，令人惊讶。
Uh, he meant, like, surprising.

100
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,918
海亚！
Hyah!

101
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:07,978
让我们把他们带回家！
Let's bring 'em home!

102
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,187
海亚！
Hyah!

103
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:31,919
海亚！
Hyah!

104
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,280
不。
No.

105
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,461
好,过来。
Okay, come here.

106
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,050
好。
Okay.

107
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:22,928
嘿 嘿。
Hey, hey.

108
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,815
我们会把你送到一个安全的地方。
We're gonna get you
someplace safe.

109
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:41,196
嘿。
Hey.

110
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,283
给你。
There you go.

111
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,160
给你。
There you go.

112
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,246
是的。
Yeah.

113
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:28,910
妈的。
Shit.

114
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:40,714
偷猎是三到五。你们都知道。
Poaching's three to five.
Y'all know that.

115
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:44,593
看起来我们会把那只动物从你手上拿下来。
Looks like we'll be
taking that animal off your hands.

116
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:45,677
就象下界一样, 你会的。
Like hell you will.

117
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,722
好吧。看来我们的朋友不认识徽章。
All right. Seems our friend
don't recognize the badge.

118
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,977
鱼类和野生动物部。
Department of Fish and Wildlife.

119
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,315
我们正在围捕那只恐龙，以保证它自己的安全。
We're rounding up that dinosaur
for its own safety.

120
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:01,485
真有意思。
That's funny.

121
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:06,865
“因为我在这里的朋友，他们通常认识所有的新成员。
'Cause my friends here,
they typically know all the new recruits.

122
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,428
谢普，你还记得在迎新会上见过这些家伙吗？
Shep, do you remember meeting these guys
in orientation or not?

123
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,036
不。
Nope.

124
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,792
恐龙骨粉是为了什麽？3000一盎司？
Dinosaur bone powder goes for what?
3000 an ounce?

125
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,127
使这里的这种动物值得...
Makes this animal here worth about...

126
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,088
拍摄，500，000美元？
Shoot, $500,000?

127
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,218
你们怎麽想这个去，对吧？
How y'all want this to go, huh?

128
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,138
你的骨头对我来说不值一提。
Your bones ain't worth nothing to me.

129
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,432
嘿，兄弟。
Hey, brother.

130
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,435
他没有撒谎。
He ain't lying.

131
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:54,955
再见了。
I'll see you around.

132
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,298
以前从未见过你从战斗中走开。
Never seen you walk away
from a fight before.

133
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,596
是的。
Yeah.

134
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:13,932
我有义务。
I got obligations.

135
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:20,916
你不应该在学校吗？
Shouldn't you be in school?

136
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,667
我在家接受教育。
I'm homeschooled.

137
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,004
是这样吗？
That so?

138
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,173
家在哪里？
And where's home?

139
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,182
我不知道!
I don't know!

140
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,851
哇!
Whoa!

141
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:42,020
最好不要站在那里，伙计。
Better not stand there, man.

142
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,942
天啊
Holy crap.

143
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,448
到底是什麽，伙计？
What in the world, man?

144
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,223
所以，恐龙...
So, the dinosaurs...

145
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:29,878
嘿。
Hey.

146
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,048
你去哪儿了?
Where you been?

147
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,884
- 无处。
- 你在燃烧什麽？
Nowhere.
What are you burning?

148
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,804
哦，没什麽。只是一些旧毯子。
Oh, nothing. Just some old blankets.

149
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,725
你确定你没有经过桥吗？
You sure you didn't go past the bridge?

150
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,537
这就是你认为我在撒谎时给我的眼神。
That's the look you give me
when you think I'm lying.

151
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:47,729
- 嗯，是吗？
- 不。
- Well, are you?
- No.

152
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,065
Maisie，你几乎到处都在找，但在这里。
Maisie, you're literally looking
everywhere but here.

153
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,275
我说我没有经过桥。
I said I didn't go past the bridge.

154
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:57,614
麦茜，
Maisie,

155
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,282
我们可以重新开始吗？
can we start over?

156
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,219
我知道，克莱尔。有些人会做任何事情来找到我。
I know, Claire. There are people out there
who'll do anything to find me.

157
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,120
我没有生气
I'm not angry.

158
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,207
- 这意味着你不必生气。
- 我没有生气
- That means you don't have to be angry.
- I'm not angry.

159
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,502
- 我可以照顾好自己。
- 嘿。
- I can take care of myself.
- Hey.

160
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:14,589
我们互相依赖是可以的。这就是人们所做的。
It's okay for us to depend on each other.
That's what people do.

161
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,633
我怎麽知道人们在做什麽？
How would I know what people do?

162
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:20,804
在过去四年里，我唯一和你交谈过的人就是你们俩。
The only people I've spoken to
in the past four years are you both.

163
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:24,891
此外，无论如何，我甚至不是一个真正的人。
Besides,
I'm not even a real person anyway.

164
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,977
- 什麽?
- 我是由别人做的。
- What?
- I was made from someone else.

165
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,896
我不是我。
I'm not me.

166
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,532
你是唯一曾经的你。
You are the only you who ever was.

167
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:43,910
什麽?
What?

168
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,454
- 不- 否。
- 这真的是陈词滥调吗？
- N-No.
- Was that, like, really corny?

169
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:47,705
太陈腐了。
It was so corny.

170
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:50,500
- 我们能保持这种关系吗？
- 答应不了。
- Can we keep that between us?
- Can't promise that.

171
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,466
- 嘿,孩子。
- 你好。
- Hey, kid.
- Hello.

172
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,634
对不起,我迟到了。
Sorry I'm late.

173
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,888
啊.
Aw.

174
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,598
你闻起来象马。
You smell like horses.

175
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,892
- 嗯。
- 哦，你喜欢这样，是吗？
- Mmm.
- Oh, you like that, do ya?

176
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,144
- 是的。是的。
- 哦。
- I do. Yeah.
- Oh.

177
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,896
好。嗯...
Okay. Um...

178
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,566
我要去做晚饭。
I'm gonna make dinner.

179
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,568
一切都还好吧?
Everything okay?

180
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,945
她又进城了。
She went into town again.

181
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:24,117
啊，这个孩子。你和她谈过吗？
Ah, this kid.
Did you talk to her?

182
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:25,869
我试过了。
I tried.

183
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,831
我会和她谈谈。
I'll talk to her.

184
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,673
呼吸缓慢。别着急。
Slow breaths. Take your time.

185
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:31,869
嘿。从自己身上切开。
Hey. Cut away from yourself.

186
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:37,292
哇!
Whoa!

187
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,420
想知道如何赢得一场刀战吗？
Wanna know how to win
a knife fight?

188
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:42,922
你必须让自己被削减。
You gotta let yourself get cut.

189
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:45,300
确保他们正在切割可有可无的东西
Make sure they're cutting
something dispensable

190
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:46,884
当你在切割一些重要的东西时。
while you're cutting something vital.

191
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,137
然后说一些很酷的话，比如...
And then say something cool like...

192
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,390
“错姑娘，错时间。”
"Wrong girl, wrong time."

193
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,684
错误的女孩，错误的时间。
Wrong girl, wrong time.

194
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:55,852
喔!
Whoo!

195
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:57,937
- 冷冰冰的。
- 正确的！
- Stone-cold.
- Right?

196
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:00,773
我不会惹她。不可能。
- I would not mess with her.
- No way.

197
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,615
听。我们可能应该谈谈你进城的事情。
Listen. We should probably
talk about you going into town.

198
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:10,867
我没有。
I don't...

199
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,390
我不认为你明白被困在这里有多糟糕。
I don't think you understand
how bad it is being trapped here.

200
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:16,581
你没有被困在这里。我们只是不信任人。
You're not trapped here.
We just don't trust people.

201
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,082
不，你只是不信任我。
No, you just don't trust me.

202
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,626
然后你希望我信任你。
And then you expect me to trust you.

203
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,046
- 为什麽我不能有任何自由？
- 因为你不能。
- Why can't I have any freedom?
- Because you can't.

204
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:29,969
这真是太好了。
That went great.

205
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:31,888
发生了什麽事情?
What is happening?

206
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:34,932
- 她14岁。
- 是的。
- She's 14.
- Yeah.

207
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:36,434
你还记得那是什麽感觉。
You remember what that was like.

208
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:38,686
我愿意。
I do.

209
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,565
我们不能永远把她留在这里。
We can't keep her here forever.

210
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:46,152
如果我们不弄清楚这一点，她会比桥走得更远。
If we don't figure this out, she's gonna
go a lot farther than the bridge.

211
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,196
如果他们找到她，我们再也不会见到她了。
If they find her,
we're never gonna see her again.

212
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,865
我们必须保护她。这就是我们的工作。这就是我们要做的。
We gotta protect her. That's our job.
That's what we're gonna do.

213
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,075
如何保护她？
Protect her how?

214
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:53,993
把她锁在里面？
By locking her inside?

215
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:57,413
她有问题。
She's got questions.

216
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,917
你知道的？我们无法回答的问题。
You know? Questions we can't answer.

217
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,629
她想知道自己是谁。
She wants to know who she is.

218
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,343
夏洛特·洛克伍德是谁。
Who Charlotte Lockwood was.

219
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,975
跟踪格雷迪到他家。
Tracked Grady to his house.

220
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,937
你是对的。猛禽有一个少年。
You were right. Raptor's got a juvenile.

221
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:24,607
但是听着，还有别的东西。
But listen, there's something else.

222
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:27,777
我找到了你一直追求的那个女孩。
I found that girl you've been after.

223
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:43,876
给你。
Here you go.

224
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:58,242
谢谢你的来。
Thanks for coming.

225
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,244
不知道该给谁打电话。
Wasn't sure who to call.

226
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:04,248
鱼和野生动物甚至不想看到它，如果它不是恐龙。
Fish and Wildlife didn't even want
to see it if it wasn't a dinosaur.

227
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:06,626
是的，好吧，他们得到了所有的注意力。
Yeah, well,
they get all the attention.

228
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,461
你们想改变采样图
You guys want to vary
the sampling plots

229
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:09,545
各一百码？
a hundred yards each?

230
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,422
这些是你的学生？
These your students?

231
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:15,718
是的。我们一直在研究工业化农业对环境的影响。
Yeah. We've been looking into the impact
of industrial farming on the environment.

232
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,262
所以，就在我们的小巷里。
So, this is right up our alley.

233
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:20,306
他们击中了该县的60个田地。
They hit 60 fields
in the county.

234
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,017
你以前见过这样的东西吗？
You seen anything like
this before?

235
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,269
不。不是这样的。
No. Not like this.

236
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:28,356
他们一直在离开整个中西部的退化田野。
They've been leaving degraded fields
all across the Midwest.

237
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:33,110
首先，这些大公司试图杀死所有的昆虫，现在这个。
First these big companies try to kill off
all the insects, now this.

238
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,081
那是你的土地吗？
Is that your land?

239
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,000
那是贝内特一家的玉米。蝗虫没有吃掉它。
That's the Bennetts' corn.
The locusts didn't eat that.

240
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:50,419
你种下的种子和班纳特是一样的吗？
You plant the same seed
as the Bennet is?

241
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:51,504
不。
No.

242
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,631
我们是独立的。
We're independent.

243
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:57,176
他们使用生物合成种子。
They use Biosyn seed.

244
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,180
是的，我敢打赌他们会。
Yeah, I bet they do.

245
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,350
你说你抓到了一个活的？
You say you caught a live one?

246
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,772
孩子们，这是艾莉·萨特勒博士。
Kids, this is Dr. Ellie Sattler.

247
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,899
她是来自大学的科学家。
She's a scientist from the university.

248
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:13,442
虫子科学家？
A bug scientist?

249
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,528
呃，差不多吧。
Uh, sort of.

250
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,989
我从很久以前就开始研究植物，
I study plants from a long time ago,

251
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:21,993
这有助于我现在弄清楚如何保护植物和土壤。
and that helps me figure out
how to protect plants and soil now.

252
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:25,121
哇。看啊。
Wow. Look at that.

253
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,668
很酷吧？
Pretty cool, huh?

254
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:33,546
这称为字段定序器
This is called a field sequencer,

255
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:37,133
它説明我随时随地读取 DNA。
and it helps me read DNA
everywhere I am.

256
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:41,429
我要把这个棉签放进他的嘴里。
I'm gonna put this swab in his mouth.

257
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,432
干得好。
Good job.

258
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:49,353
现在，我需要带你的小伙伴去公路旅行。
And now, I need to take your little buddy
on a road trip.

259
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:50,896
你把它带到哪里去？
Where are you taking it?

260
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:54,525
我需要第二种意见。
I need a second opinion.

261
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,365
嘿，玛德琳？是的？
- Hey, Madeline?
- Yeah?

262
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:03,993
我们只需要清理这个小圆柱体。
We just gotta clean out
this little cylinder.

263
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,911
好。让她慢慢下来。
Okay. Let her down slow.

264
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:09,540
- 明白了?
- 是的。
- Got it?
- Yeah.

265
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,000
容易。
Easy.

266
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,711
让我们开始填充另一边。
Let's start padding that other side.

267
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,130
就在那里。我在上面。
Just about there. I'm on it.

268
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:18,966
我们为什麽要挖掘？
Why do we dig?

269
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:24,805
因为古生物学是科学，而科学是关于真理的。
Because paleontology is science,
and science is about the truth.

270
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:26,849
这些岩石里有真理。
And there is truth in these rocks.

271
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,020
停止。
Stop.

272
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:35,024
它在这里说霸王龙有一个很小的大脑。
It says here
that the T. rex had a tiny brain.

273
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:38,861
好吧，事实证明，霸王龙比我们想象的要聪明得多。
Well, it turns out that T. rex
was way smarter than we thought.

274
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,280
能够记忆，忠诚。
Capable of memory, of loyalty.

275
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,115
那是霸王龙。
That's a T. rex.

276
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,659
他们从90年代开始就已经存在了。
They've been around
since, like, the '90s.

277
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:47,745
我不明白为什麽我们在这里挖骨头。
I don't get why we're here
digging up bones.

278
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:51,040
这似乎有点随机。
It just seems kinda random.

279
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,249
正确的？
Right.

280
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:53,667
授予!
Grant!

281
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:56,295
你会想看到这个。
You're gonna want to see this.

282
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,381
伙计们，你能帮帮我吗？
Guys, can you help me?

283
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:01,384
我会把它打包出来。我会确保没有其他人越过它。
I'll pack it out.
I'll make sure nobody else crosses it.

284
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,142
艾莉·萨特勒。
Ellie Sattler.

285
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,104
艾伦·格兰特。
Alan Grant.

286
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:15,189
你看起来一样。
You look the same.

287
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:20,444
而这个地方，它是如此...
And this place, it's so...

288
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:23,614
所以，呃...你。
so, uh... you.

289
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,536
对不起。如果我知道你要来，我会...
I'm sorry. If I'd known
you were coming, I would've...

290
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:31,997
呃...
Uh...

291
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:37,128
我能给你买点什麽吗？啤酒或...
Can I get you something?
A beer or...

292
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:42,258
嗯，好吧，也许不是在上午10点，而是冰茶或...
Um, well, maybe not at 10:00 a.m.,
but iced tea or...

293
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,759
茶。是的。
Tea. Yeah.

294
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,010
茶。我能做到。
Tea. I can do that.

295
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:49,223
在进去的路上看到很多游客。
Saw a lot of tourists
on the way in.

296
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:55,104
好吧，资金已经枯竭了，所以有人必须为这一切买单。
Well, the funding's dried up,
so somebody's gotta pay for all this.

297
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,605
正确的。谢谢。
Right. Thank you.

298
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:02,987
我读了你关于土壤科学和再生农业的文章。
I read your articles about soil science
and regenerative farming.

299
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,280
真棒。
That's great.

300
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,364
谢谢。
Thanks.

301
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:07,491
给了我一些改变的希望。
Gave me grounds
for some hope for a change.

302
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,952
还有一个关于生长藻类的。
And the one about growing algae.

303
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,580
嗯！艾伦，太神奇了。
Mmm! Alan, it's amazing.

304
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:15,374
它是一种完全可行的碳中性燃料。
It's a totally viable
carbon-neutral fuel.

305
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:19,336
这太不可思议了。我们的答案就在我们的海洋和土壤中。
It's incredible. Our answers
are in our oceans and in our soil.

306
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,980
当然，这需要工作，但我们正处于灭绝的边缘。
Sure, it's gonna take work,
but we're on the verge of extinction.

307
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,883
我的上帝。我们该怎麽办？只是坐在那里？
My God. What are we gonna do?
Just sit around?

308
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:25,593
不在我的手表上。
Not on my watch.

309
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,761
什麽?
What?

310
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,473
不，没有。我只是。
No, nothing. I just...

311
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,976
就象听你说话一样。
Just like listening to you is all.

312
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:37,771
所以，你自己在这里吗？
So, you're here on your own?

313
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:39,815
是的。靠我自己。
Yeah, yeah. On my own.

314
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:42,902
你的孩子怎麽样？
How are your kids?

315
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:44,028
嗯。
Mmm.

316
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,781
了不起。长大了。这太令人震惊了。
Amazing. Grown. It's shocking.

317
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:50,242
他们都在上大学。你能相信吗？
They're both in college.
Can you believe that?

318
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:51,619
而马克呢？
And Mark?

319
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:54,705
结束了。
It's over.

320
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:57,208
哦。
Oh.

321
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,544
哦，我很抱歉听到这个消息。
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

322
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:02,046
没关系。
It's okay.

323
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,881
我又回到了我身边。
I'm back to me.

324
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:06,008
还有我的工作。你知道，这是...
And my work. You know, it's...

325
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,092
真棒。
That's great.

326
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:10,262
很好。是的。我终于孤身一人了。
It's good. It is. I'm alone at last.

327
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:11,847
激动人心的时刻。
Exciting times.

328
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:14,433
是的，我过着艾伦·格兰特的生活。
Yeah, I'm living the Alan Grant life.

329
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:16,143
- 只是...
- 可能会很孤独。
- It's just...
- Can be lonely.

330
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:17,478
...如此自由。
...so freeing.

331
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:21,607
艾莉。
Ellie.

332
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:27,613
你一路走来不是为了赶上，现在，你呢？
You didn't come out all this way
just to catch up, now, did you?

333
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,035
嗯，那是蝗虫。
Well, that's a locust.

334
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,829
下颌骨，翅膀，胸部，但是...
Mandibles, wings, thorax, but...

335
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:38,624
上帝啊，它的大小是巨大的。
God, the size of it is massive.

336
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:43,671
它具有自白垩纪以来已经灭绝的基因。
It has genes that have been extinct
since the Cretaceous.

337
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:47,132
成群结队的农作物从爱荷华州到德克萨斯州正在大量减少。
And swarms of them are decimating crops
from Iowa to Texas.

338
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:49,134
太可怕了，对吧？
Terrifying, right?

339
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:51,720
从几百人开始。
Started as a few hundred.

340
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:53,889
到夏末可能会有数百万人。
There could be millions
by the end of the summer.

341
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:58,435
如果他们继续前进，就没有谷物来喂养鸡，牛。
If they keep going, there'll be
no grain to feed chickens, cattle.

342
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,688
整个食物链将崩溃。
The entire food chain
would collapse.

343
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:04,858
好吧，它显然是设计好的，但是为什麽有人会这样做呢？
Well, it's clearly designed,
but why would anyone do that?

344
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:09,863
他们正在吃的作物中没有一个是生物合成种子。
None of the crops they're eating
are Biosyn seed.

345
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:11,198
生物合成。
Biosyn.

346
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:13,701
你是说生物科技做了这个吗？
You're saying Biosyn made this?

347
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:17,580
我的意思是，他们想要控制世界的食物供应不会让我感到震惊。
I mean, it would not shock me that they
wanna control the world's food supply.

348
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,124
在几百万人挨饿之前。
Not before a few million starve.

349
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:24,503
是的，那是什麽说法？我们离无政府状态只有三顿饭吗？
Yeah, what is that saying?
How we're three meals away from anarchy?

350
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:27,965
如果我们不阻止他们，您可以选择最后三餐。
If we don't stop them,
you can pick your last three meals.

351
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:31,760
那麽，你为什麽要把它带给我呢？
So, why are you bringing it to me?

352
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:35,681
我需要具体的证据来证明生物科技对这一切负责。
I need concrete evidence
Biosyn's responsible for all this.

353
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:39,685
我需要去他们的避难所，从那里的另一只蝗虫身上获取DNA。
I need to go to their sanctuary
and get DNA from another locust there.

354
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:42,855
但我需要一个见证人。
But I need a witness.

355
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,107
艾伦。
Alan.

356
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,485
你得到尊重。人们相信你。
You command respect.
People believe you.

357
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:50,529
艾莉。
Ellie.

358
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:53,866
你知道我为什麽在这里。很安静。我完成了所有这些。
You know why I'm here.
It's quiet. I'm done with all that.

359
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,159
你是？好。
Are you? Okay.

360
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,786
好吧，对不起，艾伦。
Well, I'm sorry, Alan.

361
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:01,498
没有人再得到那麽奢侈了，甚至连你也不行。
Nobody gets that luxury anymore,
not even you.

362
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:02,583
你知道吗？
And you know what?

363
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:05,127
你是我信任的人。
You're the one I trust.

364
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:13,385
这个生物科学保护区，什麽，离任何地方一百英里？
This Biosyn sanctuary is, what,
a hundred miles from anywhere?

365
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,803
你是怎麽进入那里的？
How do you even get in there?

366
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:18,641
我收到了他们内部哲学家的邀请。
I got an invite
from their in-house philosopher.

367
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:22,895
这些天做混沌人似乎有很多钱。
Seems there's a lot of money
in being a chaotician these days.

368
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:26,398
他只是碰巧突然邀请你？
And he just happened
to invite you out of the blue?

369
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:29,026
他说有些事情我想看到。
He said there were things I'd wanna see.

370
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,152
嗯嗯。
Uh-huh.

371
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:37,576
你来了还是什麽？
You coming or what?

372
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:47,211
很清楚！
It's clear!

373
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:51,298
继续前进。很好。
Keep it going. That's good.

374
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:55,010
在大陆捕获的每一只动物都经过这里
Every animal captured
on the mainland comes through here

375
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:57,805
在运往生物科技在多洛米蒂山脉的避难所之前。
before shipping out
to Biosyn's sanctuary in the Dolomites.

376
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:00,849
我们给他们医疔照顾，并确保他们健康离开。
We give them medical attention
and make sure they leave healthy.

377
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,060
如此多的安全性。
So much security.

378
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,895
这些只是你看到的那些。
Those are just the ones you see.

379
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,189
很多阴暗的类型都想要这些家伙。
A lot of shady types out there
want these guys.

380
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:11,443
- 嘿。
- 你的飞机只是在加油。
- Hey.
- Your plane's just fueling up.

381
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:15,197
生物科技是一个艰难的邀请。你们一定认识某个人。
Biosyn's a tough invite.
You guys must know somebody.

382
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,032
- 你介意我...
- 答案是肯定的。
- Do you mind if I...
- Of course.

383
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,577
你好。
Hello.

384
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:23,455
你看到我了吗？你跟着我。
You see me?
You follow me.

385
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:26,083
我们从一个非法繁殖农场救出了这些家伙。
We rescued these guys
from an illegal breeding farm

386
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,710
几周前在内华达州。
in Nevada a few weeks ago.

387
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,879
关闭整个地方。匿名提示。
Shut the whole place down.
Anonymous tip.

388
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:34,717
好女孩。是的。是的。
Good girl. Yes. Yes.

389
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,595
艾伦。你永远不会习惯它。
Alan. You never get used to it.

390
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,389
好。我们很好。关闭它！
Okay. We're good. Close it up!

391
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:41,932
- 当心。
- 谢谢。再见。
- Take care.
- Thank you. Bye.

392
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:43,016
好。
Okay.

393
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,721
嘿。
Hey.

394
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,475
你看起来就象蓝色一样。
You look just like Blue.

395
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,563
这?
This?

396
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,523
你想试试吗？
You wanna try it?

397
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,650
好。
Okay.

398
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:43,243
嗯.
Huh.

399
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:49,291
麦茜，别动。
Maisie, don't move.

400
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:54,338
嘿,女孩。
Hey, girl.

401
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:56,465
远离麻烦？
Staying out of trouble?

402
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,051
她生了一个孩子。不可能。
She had a baby. That's impossible.

403
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:04,765
- 退后。
- 她不会伤害我们，对吧？
- Back up.
- She won't hurt us, right?

404
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,308
你该死的，她会的。
You're damn right she will.

405
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,851
呼吸吧。
Just breathe.

406
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:10,437

- If you don't, she'll think you're scared.
- I am scared.

407
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,149
不。她不需要知道这一点。
Nah.
She doesn't need to know that.

408
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,576
她的巢穴一定在附近。麦茜，进去吧。
Her nest has got to be nearby.
Maisie, get inside.

409
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,620

- I'm coming with you.
- What did I just say?

Hey, what's up?

412
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:43,887
哇。
Wow.

413
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,183
梅西?
Maisie?

414
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,102
梅西?
Maisie?

415
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:56,108
嗯嗯嗯
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

416
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:57,776
你要去哪里?
Where you going?

417
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,695
你不能把我留在这里。你不是我的母亲。
You can't keep me here.
You're not my mother.

418
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:07,911
她要离开家了。
She's leaving the house.

419
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,395
上车！加油！我们走吧！
Get in the truck!
Come on! Let's go!

420
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,646

加油。我们走吧!

让我们离开这里。
Let's get out of here.

425
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:03,550
你是谁?
Who are you?

426
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:26,365
克雷尔!
Claire!

427
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,241
他们找到了她。
They found her.

428
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:29,785
什麽？他们是谁？
What? Who are they?

429
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,703
偷猎 者。我在周围见过他们。
Poachers. I've seen them around.

430
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:33,705
领导者是一个真正的混蛋。
Leader's a real shit-heel.

431

他一定认出了我，跟着我来到这里。
He must have recognized me,
followed me here.

432
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,960
- 她在哪?
- 去拿卡车。
- Where is she?
- Go get the truck.

433
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,127
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

434
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,882
天啊。
Oh, God.

435
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,304
- 欧文！
- 嘿。不。

436
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:55,352
他们也带走了她的孩子。

我知道该给谁打电话。

拜托，拜托！不 不！

442
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:37,728
今年，伙计。下一步是什麽？
This year, man.
What's next?

443
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:38,979
历史？
Historically?

444
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:42,357
呃，黑暗，血腥，火雨。我想到青蛙。
Uh, darkness, blood, rain of fire.
I think frogs.

445
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:44,293
无论如何，我们不会存在太久。
We're not gonna be around
for much longer anyway.

446
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,319
内布拉斯加州的这些蝗虫即将将其包裹起来。
These locusts in Nebraska
are about to wrap it up.

447
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:47,696
他们吃玉米，小麦。
They're eating the corn, wheat.

448
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,823
基本上我们所有的食物和食物的食物。

and our food's food.

449

所以，我们可以告别这个。
So, we can say goodbye to this.

450
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:55,829
你好?
Hello?

451
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:58,165
佛兰克林。是我。你在工作吗？
Franklin. It's me. You at work?

452
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:00,417
好吧，你是这里感兴趣的话题
Okay, you're kind of
a subject of interest around here,

453
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,210
所以我不能真的和你说话。
so I can't really be talking to you.

454

加油。我有麻烦了。我真的需要你的説明。请。
Come on. I'm in trouble.
I really need your help. Please.

455
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:06,256
是的，我可能会失去工作，
Yeah, and I could lose my job,

456
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:08,341
你知道我没有资格做其他任何事情。

我们在外面。
We're outside.

458
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:12,846
让我跟他谈谈
Let me talk to him.

459
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,935
- 那个他？
- 就是他。
- That him?

460
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:23,106
名字的雷恩·德拉库尔。真正的工作。
Name's Rainn Delacourt.
Real piece of work.

461
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,191
他会拿什麽？
What'd he take?

462
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,486
我们非常关心的事情。
Something we care about
very much.

463
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:31,156
该死。我告诉过你会有人来找她。
Oh, shit. I told you somebody
would come looking for her.

464
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,075
你不能只带一个人，克雷尔。
You can't just take a person, Claire.

465
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,118
- 我们别无选择。
- 在法律的眼中不是。
- We had no choice.
- Not in the eyes of the law.

466
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:38,038
这家伙不是法律。告诉我们如何找到他。
This guy is not the law.
Tell us how to find him.

467
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:40,707
你从哪里给我打电话？
Where'd you call me from?

468
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,670
我们在德拉库尔的行动内部有一个人。
We have a man on the inside
of Delacourt's operation.

469

There's an exchange in Malta
sometime tomorrow. Cash for cargo.

470
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:49,883
她和他在一起吗？
Was she with him?

471
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:54,012
没有提到，但我们已经有人在当地了。

but we have people on the ground already.

472
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:55,472
其中之一你知道。

我要和他谈谈。
I need to talk to him.

476
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:06,858
你不能只是打电话给他。他是深深的掩护。
You can't just call him.
He's deep cover.

477
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:08,693
看，一旦我们在马尔他制作半身像
Look, once we make
the bust in Malta,

478
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:10,987
我们的人会看看德拉库尔是否知道她在哪里。
our guys will see
if Delacourt knows where she is.

479
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:14,157
我们的人。不是你。
Our guys. Not you.

480
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:18,745
答应我，你不会穿着背心进去，把一切都搞砸了。
Promise me you won't go in there
with your vest and mess everything up.

481
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,039
我为什麽要那麽做?
Why would I do that?

482
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:24,543
看，你们俩都疯了
Look, you guys are both crazy,

483
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:29,089
但你似乎是好父母，或者你想成为的任何东西。
but you seem like you're good parents,
or whatever you're trying to be.

484
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:31,133
她很幸运能有你。
She's lucky to have you.

485
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:34,469
不要被杀，好吗？
Don't get killed, okay?

486
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:54,156
我想我们差不多做到了。
I think we're almost there.

487
00:42:55,157 --> 00:42:56,158
是的。
Yeah.

我必须警告你，每个人都很高兴有你。
I have to warn you,
everyone's so excited to have you.

491

你们绝对是这里的传奇人物。
You guys are absolute legends
around here.

492
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,975
嗯，你一定是把我们和别人搞混了。
Mmm. You must be confusing us
with somebody else.

493
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:25,020
你知道，你们仍然和玛律科姆博士如此亲密，这真是太好了。
You know, it's great that you guys
are still so close with Dr. Malcolm.

494
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,939
我的意思是，有时你遇到你的英雄，他们让你失望，
I mean, sometimes you meet your heroes
and they disappoint you,

495
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:30,192
但他正是你想要他成为的样子。
but he's exactly the way
you'd want him to be.

496
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,694
我的意思是，这种思想的动力。这太不可思议了。
I mean, such motility of thought.
It's incredible.

497
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,571
你和他一起花了多少时间？
How much time
have you spent with him?

498
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:38,825
呃，好吧，我知道这是讽刺，但老实说，还不够。
Uh, well, I know that was sarcastic,
but honestly, not enough.

499
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:41,119
拜托。在你之后。注意你的头。
Oh, please. After you.
And watch your head.

for the amber deposits back in the '90s.

Please join Dr. Ian Malcolm
at noon in the lecture hall

534
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:01,593
遗传力量伦理学。
for the Ethics of Genetic Power.

535
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,762
上帝啊，每个人都那麽年轻。
God, everyone's so young.

536
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:07,182
嗯，吸引最优秀和最聪明的人是我们精神的一部分。
Well, it is part of our ethos
to attract the best and brightest.

537
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:08,767
医生。
Doctors.

538
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:13,938
受人尊敬，着名的萨特勒博士。格兰特博士。你好。
Respected, renowned Dr. Sattler.
Dr. Grant. Hi.

539
00:46:14,022 --> 00:46:16,149
哇，这很大。我是路易斯。
Wow, this is big. I'm Lewis.

540
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:18,193
- 道奇森。是的。
- 你好。
- Dodgson. Yeah.
- Hi.

541
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,046
- 你是路易斯·道奇森？
- 我是。你好？
- You're Lewis Dodgson?
- I am. How do you do?

542
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,988
我们没想到会在这里见到你。
We didn't expect
to actually see you here.

543
00:46:22,072 --> 00:46:24,282
好吧，我不会在其他地方。
Well, I wouldn't be anywhere else.

544
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:26,117
你会吗？不。
- Would you?
- No.

545
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:29,329
我的意思是，你在这里看到的人正在改变世界。
I mean, the people you see here
are changing the world.

546
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:30,830
你会介意我们，嗯...
Would you mind if we, um...

547
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:33,750
- 只是为了...这将意味着很多。
- 哦。
- Just to... It would mean a lot.
- Oh.

548
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,919
你想吗，嗯...
Do you wanna, um...

549
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,837
- 哦，太好了。非常感谢。
- 哦。
- Oh, great. Thank you so much.
- Oh.

550
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:40,340
- 很好。很好。谢谢。
- 好。
- That's good. That's good. Thanks.
- Okay.

551
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:44,719
所以，你今天将看到一些非凡的事情。
So, you are going to see
some remarkable things today.

552
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:48,515
我们正在释放基因组的真正力量。
We are unlocking the true power
of the genome.

553
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:49,933
我们非常接近。相信我。
We're this close. Believe me.

554
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,768
你会从中发财。
You'll make a fortune with that.

555
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:53,978
不，这与钱无关。
No, it's not about money.

556
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:57,357
不，我们已经确定了古DNA的数十种应用。
No, we've already identified dozens
of applications for paleo-DNA.

557
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,985
我们谈论的是癌症，阿尔茨海默氏症，自身免疫性。
We're talking about cancer,
Alzheimer's, autoimmune.

558
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:02,612
我们将拯救生命。
We will be saving lives.

559
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,572
- 但。。。嘘。
- 我敢打赌。
- But... shh.
- I bet.

560
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:08,743
嗯，无论如何，我希望我能带你一起去，但是，呃，这是......
Um, anyway, I wish I could
take you around myself, but, uh, it's...

561
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:11,996
所以，你和拉姆齐在一起的能力已经很强了。
So, you're in more-than-capable hands
with Ramsay.

562
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,208
他基本上是一个年轻的我。
He's basically a young me.

563
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:19,921
只有更聪明，呃，更高。
Only smarter and, uh, taller.

564
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,214
你有食物吗？
Do you have food?

565
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:24,300
- 比如，我的一个酒吧？
- 赦？嗯......
- Like, one of my bars?
- Pardon? Um...

566
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:26,386
不，没关系。我-我会找到一些东西。
No, never mind.
I-I'll find something.

567
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:30,765
所以，我想稍后再做更多这样的事情，如果我们，嗯......
So, I want to do more of this
later on, if we, um...

568
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:33,059
哦！我们为您预订了一个私人吊舱...
Oh! We booked you
a private pod...

569
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:34,644
- 正确的。
- ...为了外出旅行，所以...
- Right.
- ...for the trip out, so...

570
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,480
真漂亮。你会爱上它。穿过洞穴和一切。
It's beautiful. You'll love it.
Through the caverns and everything.

571
00:47:37,564 --> 00:47:39,232
你最好快点。玛律科姆上场了。
You better hurry. Malcolm's on.

572
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:41,151
他有点逆势，但我喜欢他。
He's a bit of a contrarian,
but I like him.

573
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:43,194
他让我们保持警剔。无论如何。
He keeps us on our toes. Anyway.

574
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,488
谢谢你来到这里。它。。。
Thank you for being here. It's...

575
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:50,452
好。思，请跟我来。
Okay. Um, follow me, please.

576
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:53,663
什麽?
What?

577
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:59,461
人类不再享有安全或自由的权利
Human beings have no more right
to safety or liberty

578
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:02,464
比这个星球上的任何其他生物都要多。
than any other creature
on this planet.

579
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:08,428
我们不仅缺乏对自然的统治
We not only lack dominion over nature,

580
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:10,972
我们服从于它。
we're subordinate to it.

581
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,641
现在，我们在这里
And now, here we are

582
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:16,895
有机会在我们的指尖改写生活。
with the opportunity to rewrite life
at our fingertips.

583
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:19,022
就象核电一样
And just like nuclear power,

584
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:21,900
没有人知道基因工程会发生什麽
nobody knew what to expect
with genetic engineering,

585
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:25,820
但他们按下按钮，希望得到最好的
but they pressed the button
and hoped for the best,

586
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:29,782
就象你现在所做的那样。
just like you are doing now.

587
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:32,911
是的。你。
Yep. You.

588
00:48:34,204 --> 00:48:39,792
你控制着我们在地球上生存的未来。
You control the future
of our survival on planet Earth.

589
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:42,545
根据你的说法，解决方案是遗传力。
According to you,
the solution is genetic power.

590
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:46,007
但同样的力量可能会破坏粮食供应
But that same power
could devastate the food supply,

591
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:50,720
制造新的疾病，进一步改变气候。
create new diseases,
alter the climate even further.

592
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:54,599
意想不到的后果时有发生。
Unforeseen consequences occur.

593
00:48:55,391 --> 00:49:00,146
每一次，每一次...
And every time, every single time...

594
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:03,608
我们都表现得很惊讶？
we all act surprised?

595
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,318
因为在内心深处
Because deep down,

596
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:09,697
我不认为我们中的任何一个人真的相信这些危险是真实的。
I don't think that any of us actually
believe that these dangers are real.

597
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:19,874
为了激发革命性的变革
In order to instigate
revolutionary change,

598
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:26,839
我们必须改变人类的意识。
we must transform human consciousness.

599
00:49:29,092 --> 00:49:31,094
喔!
Whoo!

600
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:33,429
是的!
Yeah!

601
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:35,974
- 可能是？
- 玛律科姆博士？
- May am?
- Dr. Malcolm?

602
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:38,893
非常好。给你。
Very good. There you go.

603
00:49:38,977 --> 00:49:40,746
我不想对我的朋友粗鲁。谢谢。
I don't want to be rude
to my friends. Thank you.

604
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,939
在我出去的路上抓住我。谢谢大家。
Catch me on my way out.
Thanks, everybody.

605
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:44,899
看看你
Look at you,

606
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:48,778
看着我，看着你。
and look at me, and look at you.

607
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:50,530
哇......这太笨拙了。
Wha... This is so trippy.

608
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,782
你看起来做得很好。
You look like you're doing well.

609
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:56,411
嗯，我有五个孩子，你知道，我比生活本身更崇拜他们，所以......
Well, I got five kids, you know,
whom I adore more than life itself, so...

610
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:57,745
费用加起来。
expenses add up.

611
00:49:57,829 --> 00:50:01,874
你？艾伦，你是...您有任何家庭或...
You? Alan, are you...
You have any family or...

612
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:05,336
- 不。
- 所以，我需要和你谈谈。
- No.
- So, I need to talk to you.

613
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:08,381
是的，我也需要和你谈谈。私自。
Yeah, I need to talk to you too.
Privately.

614
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:10,049
你们俩经常说话吗？
Do you two talk a lot?

615
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:12,302
- 他溜进了我的私信。
- 他做了什麽?
- He slid into my DMs.
- He did what?

616
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:14,220
- 这很紧急，伊恩。
- 你做了什麽?
- It's urgent, Ian.
- What did you do?

617
00:50:14,304 --> 00:50:16,055
七分钟到午夜的东西。
Seven minutes to midnight stuff.

618
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:18,558
末日时锺可能已经过时了
The Doomsday Clock might be
about out of time,

619
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:23,438
但是，正如他们所说，在永恒的虚无之前，它总是最黑暗的。
but, as they say, it's always darkest
just before eternal nothingness.

620
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,481
什麽?
What?

621
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:30,945
蝗虫随着白垩纪时代的DNA而改变。
Locusts altered with Cretaceous-era DNA.

622
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:33,990
那不是我的领域。但是，如果这些东西继续成倍增加
- That's not my field.
- But if these things continue to multiply,

623
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:37,243
我们谈论的是级联系统范围的效果，伊恩。
we're talking about
cascading system-wide effects, Ian.

624
00:50:37,327 --> 00:50:38,786
天哪，这是一种拖累。
Gosh, that's a drag.

625
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:41,039
- 你怎么了?
- “拖拽”？
- What is the matter with you?
- "Drag"?

626
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:43,162
为什麽，你想让我做些特别的事情吗？
Why, is there something special
you wanted me to do?

627
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:45,585
- 给一个该死的怎麽样？
- 你知道太多了，不在乎。
- How about give a damn?
- You know too much not to care.

628
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:48,838
嘿，多年来我一直坚定地表达了我的意见。
Hey, I gave my opinion
robustly for years.

629
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:52,634
不出所料，我们人类努力的总和导致了我们的毁灭
As expected, the sum of our human
endeavors has led to our annihilation,

630
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:56,888
现在唯一的玩法就是花点时间，呃......
and the only play now
is to take the time we have left and, uh...

631
00:50:57,472 --> 00:50:59,515
你知道，就象我们一直做的那样，浪费它。
you know,
just like we always do, squander it.

632
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,685
老实说，伊恩，那是胡说八道。
Honestly, Ian, that's bullshit.

633
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:05,480
我能给你们一些乔吗？
Can I offer you guys some joe?

634
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:08,941
泰勒，拜托，两杯卡布奇诺。
Tyler, please, two cappuccinos.

635
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:10,360
我不想要卡布奇诺。
I don't want a cappuccino.

636
00:51:10,443 --> 00:51:12,278
我可以做，比如，一个科尔塔多或玛奇朵...
I could do, like, a cortado
or macchiato...

637
00:51:12,362 --> 00:51:15,323
相信我，这真的很难，时差。这将使您振作起来。
Trust me, it's real tough, that jet lag.
This is gonna perk you right up.

638
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:23,247
蝗虫是一个名为六足同盟的大型项目的一部分。
The locusts are part of a larger project
called Hexapod Allies.

639
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:24,999
- 我...
- 你对他们的意图是正确的。
- I...
- You're right about their intent.

640
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,001
六周前，我开始听到谣言。
I started hearing rumors
six weeks ago.

641
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:29,587
我读了你关于颓废的文章，把两个和两个放在一起。
I read your piece on decadence
and put two and two together.

642
00:51:29,671 --> 00:51:32,840
- 我没有提高嗓门。
- 你开始这样做了。它正在逐渐增加。
- I was not raising my voice.
- You're beginning to. It's crescendoing.

643
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:34,217
它们正在疯狂地扩散。
They're proliferating wildly.

644
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,803
它们的持续时间比他们应该的长三到四倍。
They're lasting three,
four times longer than they should.

645
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:40,473
我所有的模型都指向全球生态崩溃，伊恩。
And all my models are pointing
toward a global ecological collapse, Ian.

646
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,225
楼下，下六层。
Downstairs, sublevel six.

647
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:44,268
那是他们养蝗虫的地方。
That's where they keep
the locusts.

648
00:51:44,352 --> 00:51:46,688
查找标记为 L4 的实验室。
Look for a lab marked L4.

649
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:48,606
但是等等，我们该如何到达那里呢？
But wait, how are we
gonna get down there?

650
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:51,359
这看起来很丝滑。我可以碰碰这件衬衫吗？
This looks so silky.
May I touch this blouse, by any chance?

651
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:52,443
确定。
Sure.

652
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:54,445
你知道它是什麽吗？别告诉我。这是...
You know what it is?
Don't tell me. This is...

653
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:57,031
- 你不会知道的。
- ...可持续竹子。
- You won't know it.
- ...sustainable bamboo.

654
00:51:57,115 --> 00:51:59,367
- 它是可持续的竹子。
- 这就是为什麽我说...
- It is sustainable bamboo.
- That's why I said...

655
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,743
- 你怎麽知道的？
- 我就是知道。
- How'd you know?
- I just know.

656
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:02,161
- 太神奇了。
- 非常惊人。
- It's amazing.
- Very amazing.

657
00:52:02,245 --> 00:52:03,246
我有孜然，肉桂。
I've got cumin, cinnamon.

658
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:05,123
我有多香果，这不是很受欢迎。
I've got allspice,
which is not very popular.

659
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:06,526
- 我有五种香料...
- 医生。
- I've got five-spice...
- Doctor.

660
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,251
...如果你喜欢那种感觉。

661
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:10,753
嗯，让我们谈谈牛奶。是的。
- Um, and let's talk milks.
- Yeah.

662
00:52:10,837 --> 00:52:12,839
好吧，豆浆，是吗？
Okay, soy milk, yes?

663
00:52:14,424 --> 00:52:16,008
不。刚刚发生了什麽？
- No.
- What just happened?

664
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:18,428
我们进来了
We're in.

665
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:34,652
第六级。限制。
Sublevel six. Restricted.

666
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:43,536
刘易斯，你不听我的。
Lewis, you're not listening to me.

667
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:47,540
蝗虫的史前DNA使它们比他们应该的更强大。
The locusts' prehistoric DNA has made them
stronger than they should be.

668
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:50,418
他们疯狂地繁殖，他们没有死。
They're multiplying like crazy
and they're not dying.

669
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:53,004
- 你不明白其中的哪一部分？
- 我明白了。
- What part of this don't you understand?
- I do understand.

670
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,839
这将是一场全球饥荒。
This is gonna be a global famine.

671
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,300
嘿，嘿，我们不能预测一切。
Hey, hey,
we can't anticipate everything.

672
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:59,260
我们需要根除我们释放的那些。
We need to eradicate the ones we released.

673
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:01,220
- 什麽?
- 全部。
- What?
- All of them.

674
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:02,555
- 不。不。
- 喜欢...
- No. No.
- Like...

675
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,932
- 亨利，我们不想引起恐慌。
- 就象昨天一样。
- Henry, we don't want to cause a panic.
- Like yesterday.

676
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:06,684
我们想要控制。
We want control.

677
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,811
没有这样的事情。
There's no such thing.

678
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:22,617
当我们害怕时
When we're afraid,

679
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,786
我们该怎麽办？
what do we do?

680
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:26,454
我们以前做过什麽？
What have we done before?

681
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:28,498
我们坚持到底。
We follow through.

682
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:31,209
我们就是这样做的。
That's what we do.

683
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:32,293
正确的?
Right?

684
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:36,130
正确的。
Right.

685
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:40,968
我们找到了那个女孩。
We found the girl.

686
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:42,428
她在路上。
She's en route.

687
00:53:42,512 --> 00:53:44,680
- 花了我一大笔钱。
- 什麽?
- Cost me a fortune.
- What?

688
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,266
- 等等，你找到了她？
- 是的，找到了他们俩。
- Wait, you found her?
- Yeah, found them both.

689
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:48,643
她和小猛禽。
Her and the little raptor.

690
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:53,815
Blue自己复制了一切，就象你说的一样。

just like you said.

691
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,024
你太聪明了，亨利。
You're so smart, Henry.

692
00:53:57,944 --> 00:53:59,111
这就是它的工作原理。
That's why this works.

693
00:53:59,779 --> 00:54:01,989
你明白这些生物的价值。
You understand the value
of these creatures.

694
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:03,491
你总是有。我也是。
You always have.
I do too.

695
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:07,453
我们不会因为一个，什麽，小副业项目向南走而停止？
We don't stop because of a, what,
little side project went south?

696
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:13,167
嘿，如果他们把蝗虫追朔到我们身边，
Hey, if they trace the locusts back to us,

697
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:14,669
他们来是为了恐龙。
they come for the dinosaurs.

698
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:16,087
你所有的工作，都消失了。
All your work, gone.

699
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:20,007
数十亿美元的资产，消失了。
Billions of dollars in assets, gone.

700
00:54:21,676 --> 00:54:24,095
钻石，没有人开采它们。
Diamonds with no one to mine them.

701
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:27,557
你真的认为她是解决方案吗？
You really think
she's the solution?

702
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:31,769
好。
Okay.

703
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,982
所有涉及女孩的事情都通过我，对吧？
Everything involving the girl
goes through me, right?

704
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:39,652
她还好吗?
Is she all right?

705
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,028
她最好是。
She better be.

706
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:45,283
她是这个星球上最有价值的知识产权。
She's the most valuable
intellectual property on the planet.

707
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:57,044
我说我会给你打电话。
I said I'd call you.

708
00:54:57,128 --> 00:54:58,421
他们降落了吗？
They land yet?

709
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:00,047
第二架飞机即将进入。
Second plane is incoming.

710
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:02,884
- 谁说过第二架飞机？
- 我们分开飞行。
- Who said anything about a second plane?
- We flew them separately.

711
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,760
我不会冒任何风险。
I'm not taking any chances.

712
00:55:04,844 --> 00:55:06,679
我们需要在交货前付款。
And we'll need payment before delivery.

713
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,806
我不喜欢上次发生的事情。
I didn't like what happened last time.

714
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:12,101
好。好吧，完成后给我打电话。
Okay. Okay, just call me when it's done.

715
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:23,654
你说我要去一个安全的地方。
You said I was going someplace safe.

716
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:25,907
你是。
You are.

717
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:36,500
- 走到车上。
- 不。
- Walk to the car.
- No.

718
00:55:37,126 --> 00:55:38,377
这不是一个选择。
It's not a choice.

719
00:55:51,182 --> 00:55:54,310
五十大飞一只小猛禽。
Fifty grand to fly one little raptor.

720
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:55,394
不错。
Not bad.

721
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:03,152
女孩怎么了？
What's with the girl?

722
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:07,239
不是你的问题。
Not your problem.

723
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:16,624
做生意的乐趣。
Pleasure doing business.

724
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,171
我们准备好了。我们走吧。
We're ready. Let's go.

725
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:30,429
欧文。

726
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:36,185
嗨，克莱尔。
Hi, Claire.

727
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:39,438
我以为你会选择一个更安静的工作。
I thought you would've chosen
a quieter line of work.

728
00:56:39,522 --> 00:56:43,275
我试过了。我和表弟开了一家咖啡馆。我持续了三个星期。
I tried. My cousin and I opened a café.
I lasted three weeks.

729
00:56:43,985 --> 00:56:46,362
世界的发展方向，很难把目光移开。
The way the world is headed,
it's hard to look away.

730
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:49,281
德拉库尔被索约娜·桑托斯聘用
Delacourt was hired by Soyona Santos,

731
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:51,367
地下恐龙贸易的经纪人。
a broker
in the underground dinosaur trade.

732
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,661
我们没有关于他的货物的情报
We don't have intel on his cargo,

733
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:57,289
但是一旦他们进行交流，我们就会看到他们对你女孩的了解。
but once they make the exchange,
we'll see what they know about your girl.

734
00:56:57,373 --> 00:57:00,751
你可以听进去，但答应我你不会联系。
You can listen in,
but promise me you will not make contact.

735
00:57:00,835 --> 00:57:01,836
不。

736
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:08,408
现在有一个很大的恐龙地下市场。
There is a big underground market
for dinosaurs now.

737
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:12,263
欧洲，中东，北非，这一切都来自这里。
Europe, Middle East, northern Africa,
it all comes through here.

738
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:25,192
不要看任何人，不要和任何人说话。
Don't look at anyone,
don't talk to anyone.

739
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:27,111
只是尝试融入。
Just try to blend in.

740
00:58:03,022 --> 00:58:05,149
我没事。
I'm okay.

741
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:19,413
还在飞向桑托斯，对吧？
Still flying for Santos, huh?

742
00:58:19,497 --> 00:58:20,581
你必须需要钱。
You must need money.

743
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:21,665
对你来说是什麽？
What's it to you?

744
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:23,793
我有货。

我给你两千。

748
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:38,057
八。
Eight.

749
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,311
他可能很丑，但他有精神。
He may be ugly, but he's got spirit.

750
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:50,528
- 你打算怎麽处理他？
- 他现在是我的。你在乎什麽？
- What are you gonna do with him?
- He's mine now. What do you care?

751
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:01,789
是的！来吧，伙计！
Yeah! Come on, man!

752
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:09,839
是的!

753
00:59:19,098 --> 00:59:20,516
你输了？
You lost?

754
00:59:21,267 --> 00:59:22,268
你是美国人。
You're American.

755
00:59:23,936 --> 00:59:25,229
这让我们成为朋友？
And that make us friends?

756
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:28,399
- 听着，我刚刚来到这里，然后...
- 哦不。
- Listen, I just got here and...
- Oh, no.

757
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:30,401
这不是邀请。这里。
That was not an invitation. Here.

758
00:59:32,695 --> 00:59:33,821
纪念品。

759
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:37,199
回到酒店，你知道，在浴缸里扔一些浴盐。
Go back to the hotel, you know,
throw some bath salts in a bath.

760
00:59:37,283 --> 00:59:40,119
这个地方，不是你的氛围。
This place, not your vibe.

761
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,203
等。
Wait.

00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:43,581
- 看。
- 克雷尔。
- Look.

763
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:45,457
克雷尔。
Claire.

764
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:47,334
我知道这一定让人感到异国情调
I know this must feel exotic,

765
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:50,838
但是如果你在这里搞砸了错误的人，你就会消失。
but if you mess with the wrong person
down here, you disappear.

766
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:51,922
你感觉到我了吗？
You feel me?

767
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:54,008
祝你好运，好吗？
Good luck, okay?

768
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:55,384
等。
Wait.

- 我需要你的説明。
- 我不认识你。
- I need your help.

771
01:00:01,432 --> 01:00:03,642
- 我在找人。
- 别这样。
- I'm looking for someone.
- Don't do that.

772
01:00:03,726 --> 01:00:05,644
她孤身一人。请。

773
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:13,777
- 那个你的女儿？

抱歉，我无法参与。

以为我得到了他。移动目标。
- Think I got him.
- Target on the move.

776
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:43,015
那是我们和他在一起的卧底特工。
That's our undercover agent
with him.

777

Claire, he's headed underground.

- 你看见他了吗？
- 是的，我有他。
- You see him?
- Yeah, I've got him.

779
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:49,939
好了,我们走。
All right, let's go.

780
01:00:50,022 --> 01:00:52,316
四队，需要你扫一扫南下。
Team four,
need you to sweep spreading south.

781
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:53,734
加油!
Come on!

782
01:00:56,779 --> 01:00:58,822
所有单位，采取靶心位置。
All units, take up bull's-eye position.

783
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:02,201
这是布拉沃一号。
This is Bravo One.

784
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:04,662
主要目标在视线之内。没有女孩的迹象。
Primary target in sight.
No sign of the girl.

785
01:01:04,745 --> 01:01:06,538
阿尔法团队，站得很清楚。
Alpha team, stand clear.

786
01:01:17,258 --> 01:01:20,135
我的人说猛禽来的时候状况良好。
My people say the raptor arrived
in good condition.

787
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:22,888
你们这些男孩没有把这个搞砸。
You boys didn't cock this up.

788
01:01:22,972 --> 01:01:24,682
颜色让我惊讶。
Color me amazed.

789
01:01:25,266 --> 01:01:28,060
我确实有另一份工作给你。短促的跳跃，钱的双倍。
I do have another job for you.
Short hop, money's double.

790
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:29,520
货物是什麽?
What's the cargo?

791
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,274
暴龙.
Atrociraptors.

792
01:01:34,066 --> 01:01:35,234
纯种马。
Thoroughbreds.

793
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:36,568
受过杀戮训练。
Trained to kill.

794
01:01:37,111 --> 01:01:39,321
- 杀谁？
- 无论他们被告知谁。
- Kill who?
- Whoever they're told.

795
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:42,658
激光标记目标，它们附着在气味上，直到它死去才停止。
Laser marks the target, they attach
to the scent, don't stop till it's dead.

796
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:44,118
不可避免。
Inescapable.

797
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:46,412
那些制造杂交种的白痴都错了。
Those idiots making hybrids
had it all wrong.

798
01:01:46,996 --> 01:01:50,332
你不能设计忠诚。你必须培养它。
You can't engineer loyalty.
You have to nurture it.

799
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:52,668
50，000飞往利雅德。
50,000 to fly them to Riyadh.

800
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,837
进还是出？
In or out?

801
01:01:55,713 --> 01:01:56,755
她不在这里。
She's not here.

802
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:02,303
我们要去哪?
Where are we going?

803
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:04,638
快到了。
Almost there.

804
01:02:10,102 --> 01:02:12,205
- 这就是下降，我们走吧！
- 需要眼睛...
- That's the drop, let's go!
- Need eyes on...

805
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:14,398
武器倒下！盯着他们！
Weapons down! Eyes on them!

806
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:15,858
双手在空中！联系达成！
Hands in the air! Contact made!

807
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:18,319
德拉库尔，现在在地板上！
Delacourt, on the floor now!

808
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:19,403
在地上！
Get on the ground!

809
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:21,196
德拉库尔！和他在一起！
Delacourt! Stay with him!

810
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,448
妈的。
Shit.

811
01:02:24,158 --> 01:02:25,534
把那辆卡车从这里拿出来！
Get that truck out of here!

812
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:27,161
桑托斯去了！
There goes Santos!

813
01:02:33,459 --> 01:02:34,918
该死的，我们失去了德拉库尔。
Damn, we lost Delacourt.

814
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:50,434
这是布拉沃一号。卡车正在接近地下信道。
This is Bravo One.
Truck is approaching the underpass.

815
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:53,270
去吧。
Go.

816
01:04:09,138 --> 01:04:10,931
伙计，来吧！滚吧！
Man, come on! Roll it!

817
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,698
女孩，她在哪里？他们把她带到哪里去了？
The girl, where is she?
Where did they take her?

818
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:29,199
- 拿开!
- 她在哪?
- Get it off!
- Where is she?

819
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:32,161
我不知道！我们把她交给了桑托斯。
I don't know! We handed her off to Santos.

820
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:34,371
我不知道在那之后他们把她带到了哪里。
I don't know
where they took her after that.

821
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,970
克雷尔，是桑托斯，白衣女人。
Claire, it's Santos, the woman in white.

822
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:51,053
我会找到她的。
I'll find her.

823
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:54,016
- 扩散;传播开。
- 布拉沃团队，注意你的六个。
- Spread out.
- Bravo team, watch your six.

824
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:58,687
嘿 嘿！嘿！等等！
- Hey, hey! Hey!
- Hold it!

825
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:01,565
- 让他们出来。
- 什麽?
- Let them out.
- What?

826
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,442
你听到了。
You heard me.

827
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:29,968
默德。
Merde.

828
01:05:47,903 --> 01:05:49,321
克雷尔，你有她吗？
Claire, do you have her?

829
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:05,337
- 我们遇到了一些麻烦。
- 何等？
- We had some trouble.
- What kind?

830
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:08,715
父母，格雷迪和迪林。他们来了。
The parents, Grady and Dearing.
They're here.

831
01:06:13,178 --> 01:06:15,681
- 你能照顾好它吗？
- 不是免费的。
- Can you take care of it?
- Not for free.

832
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:18,058
好吧，做吧。
Well, do it.

833
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:33,407
好的好的。听。
Okay, okay. Listen.

834
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:34,866
哦!
Oh!

835
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:35,951
不 不 不!
No, no, no!

836
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:50,757
你不会在人身上使用它。
You don't use it on people.

837
01:06:50,841 --> 01:06:51,967
我女儿呢?
Where's my daughter?

838
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:54,386
她一开始就不是你的。
She wasn't yours to begin with.

839
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:58,056
告诉我。
Tell me.

840
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:00,976
生物合成。
Biosyn.

841
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,061
他们要带她去生物科技。
They're taking her to Biosyn.

842
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:11,611
你想念她。
You missed her.

843
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:13,113
她不见了。
She's gone.

844
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:13,090
拉着我的手。加油。
Take my hand. Come on.

845
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:45,247
紧紧抓住。
Hold on tight.

846
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:46,957
什麽?
What?

847
01:08:57,843 --> 01:09:00,071
你还记得我们以前是如何把猛禽弄进卡车的吗？
Do you remember how we used
to get the raptors in the truck?

848
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:01,096
- 是的。
- 是的。
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

849
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:04,349
- 你起来了。
- 不。
- You're up.
- No.

850
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:07,435
在最后一刻，潜水滚动。
At the last minute, dive roll.

851
01:09:08,145 --> 01:09:09,771
- 我不潜水滚动。
- 你会没事的。
- I don't dive roll.
- You'll be fine.

852
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:12,315
我从来没有得到正确的时机。
I never got the timing right.

853
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:16,194
- 现在?
- 任何分锺。现在任何一分钟。
- Now?
- Any minute. Any minute now.

854
01:09:17,237 --> 01:09:18,864
- 现在?
- 不。
- Now?
- No.

855
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:22,576
现在!
Now!

856
01:09:26,288 --> 01:09:27,914
是的。是的！
Yeah. Yeah, yeah!

857
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:30,375
冻结!
Freeze!

858
01:09:37,716 --> 01:09:40,594
我要带我们飞出这里。告诉我你想在哪里被放下。
I'm flying us out of here.
Tell me where you wanna be dropped.

859
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:42,012
你飞过生物科技吗？
You ever flown to Biosyn?

860
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,473
欧文！他们把她带到了生物科技。
Owen! They took her to Biosyn.

861
01:09:45,557 --> 01:09:47,597
岛的北侧有一个机场。
There's an airfield
on the north side of the island.

862
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:48,810
去。
Go.

863
01:09:48,894 --> 01:09:51,313
你被捕了。留在原地。
You're under arrest. Stay where you are.

864
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:19,341
正确的！
Right!

865
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:25,305
小心！
Heads up!

866
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,947
我们今天制造了很多敌人。我们得走了。
We made a lot of enemies today.
We gotta go.

867
01:12:06,031 --> 01:12:07,198
- 他会在这里。
- 嗯嗯。
- He'll be here.
- Uh-huh.

868
01:12:11,578 --> 01:12:13,288
不合时宜，越来越好。
Out of time, out of time.

869
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:16,666
他在那儿。
There he is.

870
01:12:19,044 --> 01:12:21,129
- 停车。
- 这不是飞机的工作方式。
- Pull over.
- That's not how planes work.

871
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:28,762
打开背面。
Open the back.

872
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:48,823
加油!
Come on!

873
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:55,914
紧紧抓住!
Hold on tight!

874
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,224
哦。。。
Oh, sh...

875
01:13:26,194 --> 01:13:27,195
还是知道了。
Still got it.

876
01:13:35,537 --> 01:13:36,996
你是。。。你受伤了吗？
Are you... Are you hurt?

877
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,748
- 你没事吧？你受伤了吗？
- 是的。
- Are you okay? You hurt?
- Yeah, yeah.

878
01:13:38,832 --> 01:13:40,792
- 哪里？你在哪里受伤？
- 是的。
- Where? Where are you hurt?
- Yeah.

879
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:43,503
- 你在哪里受伤？
- 不不。我没事。我没事。
- Where are you hurt?
- No, no. I'm okay. I'm okay.

880
01:13:44,212 --> 01:13:45,338
你没事吧？什麽?
Are you okay? What...

881
01:13:46,214 --> 01:13:49,050
- 骼膊疼得很厉害。是不是流血了？
- 你没事吧?
- Arm hurts pretty bad. Is it bleeding?
- Are you all right?

882
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:51,177
我不知道。
I don't know.

883
01:13:51,261 --> 01:13:52,595
我是吗？我是吗？
Am I? Am I?

884
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:55,014
让我想想。
Let me see.

885
01:13:57,142 --> 01:13:59,102
- 是吗...它被切割了吗？
- 不。不。
- Is it... Is it cut?
- No. No.

886
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:00,186
不,你没事。
No, you're okay.

887
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:01,271
- 好。
- 你没事。
- Okay.
- You're okay.

888
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:18,329
凯拉·沃茨。
Kayla Watts.

889
01:14:19,539 --> 01:14:20,540
不客气。
You're welcome.

890
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:23,001
你看起来不象是为生物科技飞的。
You don't look like you fly for Biosyn.

891
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:26,754
我将按照你的意思而不是听起来的方式来看待它。
I'm gonna take that the way you meant it
and not the way it sounded.

892
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:29,549
我为那些得到袋子的人飞，但我们会帮这个忙。
I fly for whoever got a bag,
but we'll call this one a favor.

893
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:31,926
这些都行不通。他们破产了。
Those don't work. They broke.

894
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:36,723
我会带你们去生物科技，但我不能保证它不会很危险。
I'll take you all to Biosyn,
but I can't promise it won't be dangerous.

895
01:14:37,307 --> 01:14:39,809
你愿意为了你从未见过的人冒着生命危险吗？
You're willing to risk your life
for people you never met?

896
01:14:41,436 --> 01:14:43,354
您想问问题，还是想乘车？
You wanna ask questions,
or you want a ride?

897
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:48,902
我们将搭便车。
We'll take the ride.

898
01:14:56,201 --> 01:14:58,244
这是我们的凄息地开发实验室。
So this is
our habitat development lab.

899
01:14:58,328 --> 01:15:00,955
最近有很多令人兴奋的发现。
A lot of exciting discoveries
as of late.

900
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:03,500
我们以最纯净的形式带回了许多物种，
We've brought back numerous species
in their purest form,

901
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:07,629
我的意思是完整的，未受破坏的基因组，比如无畏厄兆龙。
and I mean complete, untouched genomes,
like Moros intrepidus.

902
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:08,963
- 什麽?
- 是的。
- What?
- Yeah.

903
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:12,217
哇。
Wow.

904
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:17,305
如何剪接DNA？
What about splicing DNA?

905
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:19,140
你知道，创造新的物种。
You know, creating new species.

906
01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:22,060
哦，不，萨特勒博士，我们在这里不这样做。
Oh, no, Dr. Sattler,
we don't do that here.

907
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:23,583
我们喜欢认为自己更进化了。
We like to think we're more evolved.

908
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:30,765
看起来我们还有一些时间在你的车程之前。
Looks like we still have
some time left before your ride.

909
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:34,197
呃，你们想自己参观这些设施吗？
Uh, would you guys like to tour
the facilities yourselves?

910
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:38,451
哦，呃，我的意思是，我们可以。
Oh, uh, I mean, we could.

911
01:15:38,535 --> 01:15:39,845
- 是啊, 为什麽不呢?
- 伟大。
- Yeah, why not?
- Great.

912
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:44,374
我会在大约30分锺内在三号站的超级高铁上与你们见面。
I'll meet you guys at the hyperloop,
station three in about 30 minutes.

913
01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:47,043
电梯在这个大厅里，而不是那些。
Elevators are down this hall,
not those.

914
01:15:47,919 --> 01:15:49,587
这些将您引导到子级别。
Those lead you
down to the sublevels.

915
01:15:50,088 --> 01:15:51,815
你需要特殊的许可才能到达那里。
You need special clearance
to get down there.

916
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:53,299
- 哦, 好吧。
- 三十分钟。
- Oh, okay.
- Thirty minutes.

917
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:04,936
这里。拿着这个。
Here. Take this.

918
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:08,273
好?
Okay?

919
01:16:08,356 --> 01:16:09,357
是的。
Yep.

920
01:16:18,825 --> 01:16:20,910
我真的很抱歉它必须以这种方式发生。
I'm really sorry
that it had to happen this way.

921
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,038
是的，这就是绑匪所说的。
Yep, that's what kidnappers say.

922
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:27,333
克雷尔永远不应该把你藏起来。
Claire should never have
hidden you away.

923
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:29,544
你太重要了，麦茜。
You're way too important, Maisie.

924
01:16:34,674 --> 01:16:35,714
你也带走了她？
You took her too?

925
01:16:36,718 --> 01:16:37,719
是的。
Yeah.

926
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:41,055
我们需要她帮助我们理解你。
We needed her
to help us understand you.

927
01:16:46,144 --> 01:16:48,021
嘿，贝塔。
Hey, Beta.

928
01:16:49,564 --> 01:16:50,857
你没事吧?
You okay?

929
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,735
你说“贝塔”吗？那是她的名字吗？
Did you say "Beta"? Is that her name?

930
01:16:54,611 --> 01:16:55,612
我把它给了她。
I gave it to her.

931
01:16:56,571 --> 01:16:57,655
Beta非常特别。
Beta is pretty special.

932
01:16:58,364 --> 01:16:59,532
你知道，当我们制作蓝色时，
You know, when we made Blue,

933
01:16:59,616 --> 01:17:02,785
我们使用监测蜥蜴的DNA来填补她基因组中的空白。
we used monitor lizard DNA
to fill in the gaps in her genome.

934
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:06,748
巨蜥可以在没有配偶的情况下繁殖。
Monitor lizards can reproduce
without a mate.

935
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:10,752
所以贝塔和蓝色在基因上是相同的
So Beta and Blue
are genetically identical,

936
01:17:10,835 --> 01:17:12,730
这就是他们与你和...
and that's what they have
in common with you and...

937
01:17:12,754 --> 01:17:14,422
夏 洛特。
Charlotte.

938
01:17:17,175 --> 01:17:18,760
你对夏洛特了解多少？
What do you know about Charlotte?

939
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:20,386
她死了
She died.

940
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:22,972
很久以前
A long time ago.

941
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:25,725
这让我爷爷心碎了。
It broke my grandpa's heart.

942
01:17:27,602 --> 01:17:28,978
所以他创造了我。
So he made me.

943
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:32,732
不，麦茜。实际上，他没有。
No, Maisie. Actually, he didn't.

944
01:17:35,318 --> 01:17:37,320
夏洛特创造了你。
Charlotte made you.

945
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:42,992
我很高兴每个人都能看到我们在这里所做的一切。
I'm so excited for everyone to see
what we've been doing here.

946
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:48,164
有新的技术正在被制造出来，新的科学，就象，几乎每天都有。
There's new technology being made,
new science, like, every day almost.

947
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:52,293
在市中心真是太好了...其中心。
And it's great to be in the center of...
Center of that.

948
01:17:53,211 --> 01:17:58,591
夏洛特和我们所有人一起住在B站，直到暴风雨。
Charlotte lived on Site B
with all of us till the storm.

949
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:01,803
她喜欢恐龙。
She loved dinosaurs.

950
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:04,097
夏洛特，小心。是的，我会的。
- Charlotte, be careful.
- Yeah, I will.

951
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,140
她在科学家的周围长大。
She grew up around scientists.

952
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:08,476
最终...
And eventually...

953
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:11,938
她自己也成了一个。
she became one herself.

954
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:14,232
今天早上，一只蝴蝶飞了我的办公室。
A butterfly flew
info my office this morning.

955
01:18:14,816 --> 01:18:18,611
他们说小事有巨大的影响，我全心全意地同意。
They say tiny things have huge impacts,
and I agree wholeheartedly.

956
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:19,696
她很出色
She was brilliant.

957
01:18:19,779 --> 01:18:22,448
对于我所有与生物的工作，翅膀拍打...
For all my work with creatures,
wings flapping...

958
01:18:22,532 --> 01:18:24,158
以我永远不会的方式。
In ways that I'll never be.

959
01:18:24,242 --> 01:18:28,037
在身分的形而上学中，复制品真的能是原件吗？
In the metaphysics of identity,
can a replica truly be the original?

960
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:31,582
如果这是可能的，那麽是什麽让它如此？
And if it's possible, what makes it so?

961
01:18:36,963 --> 01:18:38,256
我丢了笔。
I've lost my pen.

962
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:43,302
是我吗？
Is that me?

963
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:45,805
是的。
Yeah.

964
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:49,517
就象布鲁一样，夏洛特能够独自生一个孩子。
Just like Blue, Charlotte was able
to have a child all by herself.

965
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:54,105
她用自己的DNA创造了你。
She created you with her own DNA.

966
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:57,442
所以我确实有一个母亲。
So I do have a mother.

967
01:18:57,525 --> 01:19:00,695
你爷爷不想让任何人知道真相。
Your grandfather didn't want
anyone to know the truth.

968
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:03,322
他在保护她，还有你。
He was protecting her, and you.

969
01:19:04,741 --> 01:19:05,992
我们是一样的吗？
And we're the same?

970
01:19:07,869 --> 01:19:09,203
你是.
You were.

971
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:13,458
当你还是个婴儿的时候，夏洛特开始出现遗传性疾病的症状。
When you were a baby, Charlotte started
to show symptoms of a genetic disorder.

972
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:16,210
她就是这样死的。
That's how she died.

973
01:19:16,294 --> 01:19:18,921
直到你出生後，她才知道她有它。
She didn't know she had it
until after you were born.

974
01:19:20,131 --> 01:19:21,632
- 我也有吗？
- 不。
- Do I have it too?
- No.

975
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:25,386
她改变了你的DNA。
She changed your DNA.

976
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:30,016
她改变了你身体的每一个细胞，以根除这种疾病。
She altered every cell in your body
to eradicate this disease.

977
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,269
地球上没有人知道如何做到这一点。
No one on earth has ever known
how to do that.

978
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:35,646
她修好了我。
She fixed me.

979
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:38,232
夏洛特的发现现在是你的一部分。
Charlotte's discovery
is a part of you now.

980
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:43,029
你的DNA可以改变世界。
Your DNA could change the world.

981
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:48,117
我必须知道她是怎麽做到的，但我就是无法复制她的作品。
And I have to know how she did it,
but I just can't replicate her work.

982
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:53,039
如果我能研究你和贝塔，他们的DNA从未改变过，我可以......
If I could just study you and Beta,
whose DNA was never changed, I could...

983
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:58,586
修复我犯的一个可怕的错误。
fix a terrible mistake that I've made.

984
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:00,463
什麽样的错误？
What kind of mistake?

985
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:10,973
第六级。限制。
Sublevel six. Restricted.

986
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:16,854
谢谢你的来。
Thanks for coming.

987
01:20:21,943 --> 01:20:25,071
玛律科姆说的是哪个实验室？L4.
- Which lab did Malcolm say?
- L4.

988
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:31,035
就是这样。
This is it.

989
01:20:50,388 --> 01:20:54,183
好。进去，拿到样品，然后出去。
Okay. Get in,
get the sample and get out.

990
01:20:54,267 --> 01:20:55,268
并缓慢移动。
And move slow.

991
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:57,812
它们可以在最轻微的干扰下蜂拥而至。
They can swarm
at the slightest disturbance.

992
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,213
直翅目。
Orthoptera.

993
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:27,008
两周。
Two weeks.

994
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:33,806
完全成熟。这个。
Fully mature. This one.

995
01:21:35,016 --> 01:21:38,060
准备？容易。
Ready? Easy.

996
01:21:42,857 --> 01:21:44,942
好。去。
Okay. Go.

997
01:21:46,611 --> 01:21:47,612
什麽?
What?

998
01:21:49,113 --> 01:21:50,406
去拿吧
Go get it.

999
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:53,743
有必要吗？
Is that necessary?

1000
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:56,245
为何-你认为会发生什麽？
Wh-What did you think was gonna happen?

1001
01:21:56,329 --> 01:21:59,457
我必须取一个样本。我们需要具体的证据。就是这样。
I have to take a sample.
We need concrete evidence. This is it.

1002
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:02,668
艾伦，你说没有时间。你能得到它吗？
Alan, you said there was no time.
Can you get it?

1003
01:22:03,336 --> 01:22:04,587
当然，我可以得到它。
Of course I can get it.

1004
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:07,006
好。容易。
Okay. Easy.

1005
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:10,718
注意它的腿。
Watch its legs.

1006
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:13,763
呸。是的。
Ugh. Yech.

1007
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:15,306
来吧。
Here we go.

1008
01:22:17,308 --> 01:22:19,727
它们是它们之间的细胞信号传导。这不好，艾莉。
They're cell signaling between them.
This is not good, Ellie.

1009
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:20,978
我差点就明白了。
I almost got it.

1010
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:27,526
亨利，如果你把我们俩都牵连起来，她怎麽仍然是一笔资产呢？
How does she remain an asset, Henry,
if you're incriminating both of us

1011
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:30,071
通过在电脑上显示她的机密内容？
by showing her classified things
on the computer?

1012
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:33,491
夏洛特·洛克伍德相信侏罗纪公园使用的方法
Charlotte Lockwood believed
the methods used at Jurassic Park

1013
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:34,575
可以治愈疾病。
could cure disease.

1014
01:22:35,242 --> 01:22:36,410
她是对的。
She was right.

1015
01:22:36,494 --> 01:22:40,665
用改变的DNA填补了Maisie基因组中的空白
Having filled the gaps
in Maisie's genome with altered DNA,

1016
01:22:40,748 --> 01:22:44,418
她使用病原体将修复后的串行传递到每个细胞。
she used a pathogen to deliver
the repaired sequence to every cell.

1017
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:49,131
如果我能重新利用她的所作所为，我就能改变蝗虫的DNA
If I can repurpose what she did,
I could change the locust DNA,

1018
01:22:49,215 --> 01:22:51,467
在一代人的时间雷根除它们。
eradicating them in a single generation.

1019
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:54,762
麦茜和小猛禽将提供缺失的数据。
Maisie and the baby raptor
will provide the missing data.

1020
01:23:02,770 --> 01:23:04,522
嘿，你想离开这里吗？
Hey, do you wanna get out of here?

1021
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:09,735
什麽。。。
What the...

1022
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:12,513
明白了。
Got it.

1023
01:23:20,538 --> 01:23:22,623
哦,我的上帝!
Oh, my God!

1024
01:23:22,707 --> 01:23:24,375
它们无处不在！帮帮我！
They're everywhere! Help me!

1025
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:27,336
天啊！不！
Oh, God! No!

1026
01:23:28,295 --> 01:23:31,674
哦,我的上帝!哦,我的上帝!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1027
01:23:37,263 --> 01:23:38,764
梅西
Maisie.

1028
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:52,254
资产遏制违槼。
Asset containment breach.

1029
01:23:52,278 --> 01:23:53,738
请留在您的车站。
Please remain at your stations.

1030
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:58,826
资产遏制违槼。请留在您的车站。
Asset containment breach.
Please remain at your stations.

1031
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:02,621
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

1032
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:04,749
- 天啊。我看不见！
- 关键在哪里？
- Oh, God. I can't see!
- Where's the key?

1033
01:24:08,586 --> 01:24:09,587
天啊!
Oh, God!

1034
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:23,851
你没事吧?
You okay?

1035
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,687
是的。你？
Yeah. You?

1036
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:28,647
是的。
Yeah.

1037
01:24:31,317 --> 01:24:32,610
哦。
Oh.

1038
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:42,828
你是艾莉·萨特勒博士和艾伦·格兰特。
You're Dr. Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant.

1039
01:24:42,912 --> 01:24:44,371
你在侏罗纪公园。
You were at Jurassic Park.

1040
01:24:45,623 --> 01:24:47,083
你在这里干什麽?
What are you doing here?

1041
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:49,085
什麽？什麽。。。
What? What...

1042
01:24:49,752 --> 01:24:50,920
你在这里干什麽?
What are you doing here?

1043
01:24:53,506 --> 01:24:54,799
我是麦茜洛克伍德。
I'm Maisie Lockwood.

1044
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:07,686
呃，嘿，我们没有，呃...
Uh, hey, we don't, uh...

1045
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:10,773
我们不是...我们不为生物科技工作。
We're not...
We don't work for Biosyn.

1046
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:11,982
我可以说
I can tell.

1047
01:25:12,066 --> 01:25:14,527
- 我们得离开这里
- 是的，我们应该走了。
- We gotta get out of here.
- Yeah, we should go.

1048
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:32,795
好。仔细地。我们找到你的女孩，然后走。
Okay. In and out.
We find your girl and go.

1049
01:25:34,547 --> 01:25:37,800
塔，这是N141。要求上岸进行货物运输。多。
Tower, this is N141. Request to land
for freight delivery. Over.

1050
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:39,385
N141，阴性。
N141, negative.

1051
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:42,221
我们被告知您携带未经授权的乘客。多。
We've been advised you're carrying
unauthorized passengers. Over.

1052
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:45,975
复制它，塔。请注意，货件易腐烂。
Copy that, Tower.
Be advised shipment is perishable.

1053
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:48,394
我们需要立即清除。这是紧急情况。多。
We need immediate clearance.
It's an emergency. Over.

1054
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:49,478
没有...不。
There isn't... No.

1055
01:25:50,688 --> 01:25:52,648
阴性。返回到原点。
Negative.
Return to point of origin.

1056
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:55,776
你似乎要分手了。你听到我站在你这边了吗？
You seem to be breaking up.
Are you hearing me on your side?

1057
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:58,028
可能需要检查系统。
May need to check systems.

1058
01:25:58,112 --> 01:26:00,030
不错的尝试，凯拉。他们会打倒你的鸟。
Nice try, Kayla.
They will down your bird.

1059
01:26:00,948 --> 01:26:03,242
你是谁？这是丹妮丝吗？
Who is this?
Is this Denise?

1060
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:06,996
你不希望我开始泄露秘密，丹妮丝。你还记得杜布罗夫尼克。
You do not want me to start spilling
secrets, Denise. You remember Dubrovnik.

1061
01:26:08,956 --> 01:26:09,957
她...
She's...

1062
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:13,460
不同的邓尼斯，在帐户中。
Different Denise, in accounts.

1063
01:26:21,343 --> 01:26:24,305
和桑托斯谈过。这是女孩的父母。
Talked to Santos.
It's the girl's parents.

1064
01:26:27,224 --> 01:26:28,893
让我们关闭广告。
Let's shut off the ADS.

1065
01:26:29,602 --> 01:26:30,603
是否确定?
Are you sure?

1066
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:32,813
嗯嗯。
Uh-huh.

1067
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:40,946
什麽?
What's that?

1068
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:42,281
呃...
Uh...

1069
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:44,700
就是这样，呃...这就是空中威慑系统。
That's the, uh...
That's the Aerial Deterrent System.

1070
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:47,536
- 远离空气中的生命。
- 为什麽会闪铄？
- Keeps the airborne life away.
- Why is it blinking?

1071
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:49,663
塔里的死屁股丹妮丝刚刚把它关掉了。
Dead ass Denise in the tower
just turned it off.

1072
01:26:49,747 --> 01:26:51,957
我们现在必须离开这个空域。
We gotta get out of this airspace
right now.

1073
01:26:56,337 --> 01:26:59,256
- 那是另一架飞机，对吧？
- 不完全是。
- That's another plane, right?
- Not exactly.

1074
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:04,887
这是...风神翼龙属.
- Is that a...
- Quetzalcoatlus.

1075
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:07,598
白垩纪晚期，应该住在那里。
Late Cretaceous,
should have stayed there.

1076
01:27:13,771 --> 01:27:16,232
好。好。
Okay. Okay.

1077
01:27:16,315 --> 01:27:18,359
这很酷。我们很好。不见了。
It's cool. We're good. It's gone.

1078
01:27:35,668 --> 01:27:37,127
这架飞机要坠毁了！
This plane is going down!

1079
01:27:37,211 --> 01:27:40,256
如果您要弹出，则需要立即运行此操作！
If you're gonna eject,
you need to do it now!

1080
01:27:40,339 --> 01:27:43,342
- 我只有一把椅子，她就在里面。
- 你没有降落伞吗？
- I only got one chair, and she's in it.
- You don't have parachutes?

1081
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:45,594
我没想到公司！
I wasn't expecting company!

1082
01:27:53,394 --> 01:27:56,146
克雷尔！我们必须把你从这架飞机上下来。
Claire! We gotta get you off this plane.

1083
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:57,314
什麽?
What?

1084
01:27:57,398 --> 01:27:59,108
降落伞将自动打开。
The parachute is gonna open automatically.

1085
01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:01,944
如果没有，你拉动这个杠杆。你理解我吗？
If it doesn't, you pull this lever.
Do you understand me?

1086
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:04,280
克雷尔！如果它没有自动打开，
Claire!
If it doesn't open automatically,

1087
01:28:04,363 --> 01:28:06,365
你要把这个杠杆拉到你身后。好？
you're gonna pull
this lever behind you. Okay?

1088
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:07,908
一万英尺！
Ten thousand feet!

1089
01:28:07,992 --> 01:28:09,994
嘿，你是那个必须去找她的人。
Hey, you're the one
who's gotta go to get to her.

1090
01:28:10,077 --> 01:28:12,037
你是她的妈妈。你是她唯一的镜头。
You're her mom.
You're her only shot.

1091
01:28:15,249 --> 01:28:16,250
再见了
I'll see you again.

1092
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:19,336
我爱你。
I love you.

1093
01:29:09,178 --> 01:29:10,179
计划是什麽?
What's the plan?

1094
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:13,182
无论发生什麽。这就是计划。
Whatever happens. That's the plan.

1095
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:28,739
- 三。
- 这边。
- Three.
- This way.

1096
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:32,284
艾伦，我们需要代码。让我们试试这个东西。
- Alan, we need the code.
- Let's try this thing.

1097
01:29:32,368 --> 01:29:33,368
是的。
Yeah.

1098
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:35,329
趴下。
Get down.

1099
01:29:41,085 --> 01:29:43,504
- 感谢上帝，这是你！
- 我知道。
- Thank God it's you!
- I know.

1100
01:29:43,587 --> 01:29:45,339
- 这个地方是迷宫。
- 好你来了。
- This place is a maze.
- Good you're here.

1101
01:29:45,422 --> 01:29:47,549
我们太困惑了。我以为我们迷路了。
We were so confused.
I thought we were lost.

1102
01:29:47,633 --> 01:29:49,802
然后你说第三站。我当时想，在这里...
Then you said station three.
And I was like, here...

1103
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:51,095
你有样品吗？
Do you have the sample?

1104
01:29:51,845 --> 01:29:53,285
- 什麽?
- 你在谈论什麽?
- What?
- What are you talking about?

1105
01:29:53,347 --> 01:29:55,099
DNA样本。你有吗？
The DNA sample. Do you have it?

1106
01:29:55,682 --> 01:29:57,726
生物合成负责蝗虫流行。
Biosyn's responsible
for the locust epidemic.

1107
01:29:57,810 --> 01:29:59,895
道奇森掩盖了它。你是对的。
Dodgson's covering it up.
You were right.

1108
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:01,438
我是来帮你的
I'm here to help you.

1109
01:30:01,522 --> 01:30:02,606
你有吗？
Do you have it?

1110
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:04,566
是的。
Yeah.

1111
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:05,651
好。
Good.

1112
01:30:06,652 --> 01:30:08,404
这个吊舱将带您到机场。
This pod will take you
to the airfield.

1113
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:10,114
我们有一架飞机准备飞行。
We have a plane ready to fly.

1114
01:30:10,197 --> 01:30:12,616
- 伊恩跟你说过六足盟友？
- 不。
- Ian told you about Hexapod Allies?
- No.

1115
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:13,867
我告诉他。
I told him.

1116
01:30:13,951 --> 01:30:14,952
什麽?
What?

1117
01:30:15,536 --> 01:30:17,538
- 好。你们得走了。
- 等。
- Okay. You guys gotta go.
- Wait.

1118
01:30:22,209 --> 01:30:23,210
梅西
Maisie.

1119
01:30:26,922 --> 01:30:27,923
麦茜·洛克伍德。
Maisie Lockwood.

1120
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:32,177
去。
Go.

1121
01:34:39,675 --> 01:34:41,885
好。
Okay.

1122
01:34:47,224 --> 01:34:48,767
那是我的孩子。
That was my baby.

1123
01:34:50,394 --> 01:34:52,145
好的。
Okay, okay.

1124
01:34:57,317 --> 01:34:59,194
你在哪里学过飞行？
Where'd you learn to fly?

1125
01:34:59,277 --> 01:35:02,698
呃，空军。我妈妈那边的遗产。
Uh, Air Force.
Legacy on my mama's side.

1126
01:35:02,781 --> 01:35:04,116
是的。我是海军。
Yeah. I'm Navy.

1127
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:07,411
好吧，那麽你最终是如何做到这一点的呢？
Okay, so how'd you end up doing this?

1128
01:35:07,494 --> 01:35:09,496
我是一个合法的合同飞行员
I was a legit contract pilot
for a grip,

1129
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:12,457
但它并没有支付足够的钱来在这里寄钱回家。
but it didn't exactly pay enough
to be out here sending money home.

1130
01:35:12,541 --> 01:35:15,293
所以我打了几个联系人，以获得更有利可图的阴暗狗屎。
So I hit up a few contacts
for the more lucrative shady shit.

1131
01:35:16,545 --> 01:35:19,297
老实说，我可能已经完成了这项工作。
Honestly, I might be done
with this line of work.

1132
01:35:19,881 --> 01:35:21,174
这就是你帮助我们的原因吗？
Is that why you're helping us?

1133
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:27,347
当他们把你的女孩交给生物科技时，我就在那里。
I was there
when they handed your girl off to Biosyn.

1134
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:32,102
我本来可以说些什麽，但我没有。
I could have said something, but I didn't.

1135
01:35:32,185 --> 01:35:33,895
当我看到她的照片时...
And when I saw her picture...

1136
01:35:36,398 --> 01:35:37,649
什麽都不做是不够的。
It isn't enough to do nothing.

1137
01:35:43,613 --> 01:35:44,698
谢谢。
Thank you.

1138
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:32,704
不。
No.

1139
01:36:37,501 --> 01:36:38,502
不。
Nope.

1140
01:37:02,818 --> 01:37:04,069
真是个混蛋。
What an asshole.

1141
01:37:55,537 --> 01:37:56,538
你很好?
You good?

1142
01:37:57,122 --> 01:37:59,791
是的。是的。是的，我一点也不动摇。你？
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm not shook at all. You?

1143
01:37:59,875 --> 01:38:01,877
不。不不。
Nah. Nah, no.

1144
01:38:04,462 --> 01:38:06,673
弹射座椅信标。我们会找到她的。
Ejection seat beacon.
We'll find her.

1145
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:08,717
好的。
Okay, okay.

1146
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,051
你真的爱她，对吧？
You really love her, huh?

1147
01:38:12,137 --> 01:38:13,138
是的。
Yeah.

1148
01:38:13,847 --> 01:38:14,848
我明白了。
I get it.

1149
01:38:16,224 --> 01:38:17,851
我也喜欢红头发。
I like redheads too.

1150
01:38:19,102 --> 01:38:20,562
什麽？神。
What? God.

1151
01:38:24,691 --> 01:38:27,193
- 那是谁?
- 这是格兰特和萨特勒。
- Who is that?
- It's Grant and Sattler.

1152
01:38:27,277 --> 01:38:29,529
- 这是活的吗？
- 十二分钟前。
- Is this live?
- Twelve minutes ago.

1153
01:38:29,613 --> 01:38:32,490
我们正在跟踪逃逸的资产。我的人错过了它。
We were tracking the escaped asset.
My guys missed it.

1154
01:38:32,574 --> 01:38:34,451
他们偷走了DNA样本。
They stole a DNA sample.

1155
01:38:35,035 --> 01:38:36,202
他们是怎麽进入那里的？
How'd they get in there?

1156
01:38:36,286 --> 01:38:38,914
他们使用了访问密钥。洋基白清除。
They used an access key.
Yankee White clearance.

1157
01:38:40,373 --> 01:38:43,752
我们的一台摄象机看到伊恩·玛律科姆 在萨特勒的口袋里放了一些东西。
One of our cameras saw Ian Malcolm
put something in Sattler's pocket.

1158
01:38:44,711 --> 01:38:47,797
好吧。我想见见他。
All right.
I want to see him.

1159
01:38:47,881 --> 01:38:49,674
把拉姆齐也带到这里来，对吧？
And get Ramsay up here too,
will you?

1160
01:38:51,134 --> 01:38:53,762
- 他们现在在哪里？
- 在去机场的路上。
- Where are they now?
- On the way to the airfield.

1161
01:38:53,845 --> 01:38:55,889
他们按时赶上了超级高铁。
They caught the hyperloop
right on schedule.

1162
01:39:02,062 --> 01:39:03,063
你好吗?
How are you?

1163
01:39:04,272 --> 01:39:06,024
你没事吧?
You all right?

1164
01:39:07,108 --> 01:39:08,360
不是真的，不是。
Not really, no.

1165
01:39:10,737 --> 01:39:11,738
嘿。
Hey.

1166
01:39:12,572 --> 01:39:14,908
我，呃，认识妈。
I, uh, knew your mom.

1167
01:39:18,495 --> 01:39:19,537
你有吗?
You did?

1168
01:39:19,621 --> 01:39:20,914
嗯嗯。
Mm-hmm.

1169
01:39:22,415 --> 01:39:25,335
是的，哈蒙德死后几年
Yeah, a few years
after Hammond died,

1170
01:39:26,169 --> 01:39:29,130
她来我大学讲课
she came to my university to lecture,

1171
01:39:29,214 --> 01:39:32,217
我们成了好朋友。
and we became good friends.

1172
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:34,344
她是什麽样的人？
What was she like?

1173
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:35,512
辉煌。
Brilliant.

1174
01:39:35,595 --> 01:39:38,723
比其他人领先几光年。
Light-years ahead
of everybody else.

1175
01:39:38,807 --> 01:39:41,017
她有良知。
And she had a conscience.

1176
01:39:41,101 --> 01:39:43,228
当他们外出建造主题公园时
While they were out
building theme parks,

1177
01:39:43,311 --> 01:39:46,982
好吧，她决心证明遗传力量可以挽救生命。
well, she was determined to prove
that genetic power could save lives.

1178
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,985
我是她的实验。
And I was her experiment.

1179
01:39:50,068 --> 01:39:51,528
不。
No.

1180
01:39:53,738 --> 01:39:56,491
她最想要一个孩子。
She wanted a child more than anything.

1181
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:59,703
但她希望你拥有她不能拥有的东西。
But she wanted you to have
what she couldn't.

1182
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:02,414
充实的生活。
A full life.

1183
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:07,252
我认识她的时间不长，
I didn't know her long,

1184
01:40:08,169 --> 01:40:10,463
但我知道她非常爱你。
but I know she loved you very much.

1185
01:40:30,942 --> 01:40:32,110
发生了什麽事情?
What's happening?

1186
01:40:39,743 --> 01:40:41,953
这一定是旧的琥珀矿。
This must be the old amber mines.

1187
01:40:42,037 --> 01:40:43,580
我们在山里。
We're inside the mountain.

1188
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:46,291
他们在建造这些隧道时必须设置门。
They must've made access doors
when they built these tunnels.

1189
01:40:48,418 --> 01:40:49,419
准备好了吗?
You ready?

1190
01:40:50,837 --> 01:40:51,880
我很好。
I'm good.

1191
01:40:52,756 --> 01:40:54,174
不，这是不合理的。
No, that's not reasonable.

1192
01:40:54,257 --> 01:40:56,176
你想进入黑暗的隧道。
You want to go into the dark tunnel.

1193
01:40:56,718 --> 01:40:58,762
我想留在防弹管里。
I want to stay in the bulletproof tube.

1194
01:40:59,387 --> 01:41:00,722
谁在不讲道理？
Who's being unreasonable?

1195
01:41:01,556 --> 01:41:04,642
但防弹管没有门。
But the bulletproof tube has no door.

1196
01:41:08,396 --> 01:41:09,606
看，呃...
Look, uh...

1197
01:41:13,068 --> 01:41:16,654
我知道你的感受。它。。。这太可怕了。是的。
I know how you feel.
It's... It's scary. It is.

1198
01:41:17,447 --> 01:41:20,825
但相信我，向前迈进总比保持静止要好。
But trust me, moving forward
is better than staying still.

1199
01:41:20,909 --> 01:41:24,287
而萨特勒博士在这里是个好人，处于紧张状态
And Dr. Sattler here is
a good person in a tight spot,

1200
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:26,164
这是一个紧张的地方。
and this is a tight spot.

1201
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:28,041
所以，你来了？
So, you coming?

1202
01:41:31,753 --> 01:41:32,879
好吧。
All right.

1203
01:41:58,363 --> 01:42:01,032
嘿，我听到了警报。一切都好吗？
Hey, I heard the alarm.
Everything all right?

1204
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:04,536
是的。不不。没有什麽我们不能，呃，处理。听。。。
Yeah. No, no.
Nothing we can't, uh, handle. Listen...

1205
01:42:05,203 --> 01:42:06,704
- 你响了吗？
- 哦,很好。
- You rang?
- Oh, good.

1206
01:42:06,788 --> 01:42:09,165
玛律科姆博士，你是...
Dr. Malcolm, you are...

1207
01:42:09,249 --> 01:42:11,417
- 解雇。
- 什麽?
- fired.
- What?

1208
01:42:12,252 --> 01:42:14,921
这是一场如此舒适的演出。
It was such a cushy gig.

1209
01:42:15,004 --> 01:42:19,509
如果您仍然拥有访问密钥，则可以将其提供给安全性。
You can give your access key to security
if you still have it.

1210
01:42:19,592 --> 01:42:22,178
其中一个超级高铁吊舱刚刚在琥珀矿井中关闭。
One of the hyperloop pods
just shut down in the amber mines.

1211
01:42:22,262 --> 01:42:23,721
什麽?
What?

1212
01:42:23,805 --> 01:42:26,140
哇。这一天。
Wow. This day.

1213
01:42:26,224 --> 01:42:28,101
呃，这...我们是哪个吊舱...
Uh, which... Which pod are we...

1214
01:42:28,184 --> 01:42:29,269
有吗，嗯...
Are there, um...

1215
01:42:30,603 --> 01:42:32,021
矿井里的恐龙？
dinosaurs in the mines?

1216
01:42:32,105 --> 01:42:33,606
到处都是恐龙。
There are dinosaurs everywhere.

1217
01:42:33,690 --> 01:42:36,317
从技术上讲，鸟类是恐龙，至少从g遗传学上讲。
Technically, birds are dinosaurs,
g-genetically speaking at least.

1218
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:38,570
好。刘易斯，格兰特和萨特勒就在这个豆荚里。
Okay.
Lewis, Grant and Sattler are in this pod.

1219
01:42:38,653 --> 01:42:41,698
- 我们需要尽快派出一个安全团队。
- 当然可以，拉姆齐。谢谢。
- We need to send a security team ASAP.
- Absolutely, Ramsay. Thank you.

1220
01:42:41,781 --> 01:42:44,784
不过，让我们都呆在我们的车道上。我们可以照顾它。
Let's all just stay in our lanes though.
We can take care of it.

1221
01:42:44,868 --> 01:42:45,994
谢谢你 医生。
Thank you, Doctor.

1222
01:42:46,077 --> 01:42:48,496
就是这样，对吧？这里没什麽可看的吗？
That's it, huh?
Nothing else to see here?

1223
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:52,667
呃，我不确定我现在是否欣赏你的语气。
Uh, I'm not sure
I admire your tone right now.

1224
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:54,270
- 你需要离开。
- 是的,我愿意。
- You need to leave.
- Yeah, I do.

1225
01:42:54,294 --> 01:42:57,672
但首先，我欠所有这些人一个道歉。
But first,
I owe all these folks an apology.

1226
01:42:57,755 --> 01:43:00,550
我认为，通过把我的声望借给这个关节
I think that by lending my cachet
to this joint,

1227
01:43:00,633 --> 01:43:03,428
我可能会让生物科技看起来好象没有腐烂到核心。
I might've made it seem
as if Biosyn wasn't rotten to the core.

1228
01:43:03,511 --> 01:43:04,679
够了，伊恩。
That's enough, Ian.

1229
01:43:04,762 --> 01:43:05,930
看，这是他们如何得到你。
See, here's how they get you.

1230
01:43:06,014 --> 01:43:08,295
他们在短时间内为您提供如此多的促销活动
They give you so many promotions
in a short period of time

1231
01:43:08,349 --> 01:43:10,685
它打击了你的批判性思维能力。
that it bludgeons your capacity
for critical thinking.

1232
01:43:10,768 --> 01:43:11,769
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

1233
01:43:11,853 --> 01:43:15,023
然后有一些你没有打开的门，你忽略的东西。
Then there are doors that you don't open,
things that you ignore.

1234
01:43:15,106 --> 01:43:20,653
但主要是，他正在利用你对这些的魅力。
But mainly, he's exploiting
your enchantment with these.

1235
01:43:20,737 --> 01:43:22,739
这里是否有实际问题，或者您只是...
Is there an actual concern here,
or are you just...

1236
01:43:22,822 --> 01:43:26,868
你正在朝着我们物种的灭绝冲刺，你不在乎。
You're racing toward the extinction
of our species, and you don't care.

1237
01:43:26,951 --> 01:43:29,996
你确切地知道你在做什麽，但你不会停止。
You know exactly what you're doing,
but you won't stop.

1238
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:31,122
你不能。
You can't.

1239
01:43:31,706 --> 01:43:34,959
我以为你可能不一样，但你和其他人一样。
I thought you might be different,
but you're just like everyone else.

1240
01:43:35,043 --> 01:43:36,502
你看到你想看到的东西。
You see what you want to see.

1241
01:43:36,586 --> 01:43:40,757
你想象不受控制的贪婪，所以这就是你发现的。
You imagine unchecked avarice,
so that's what you find.

1242
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:44,761
你想象，什麽，一个邪恶的，未绑定的普罗米修斯
You envision, what,
an evil, unbound Prometheus,

1243
01:43:44,844 --> 01:43:47,180
- 这就是我对你的看法？
- 普罗米修斯被吓坏了。
- so that's what I am to you?
- Prometheus got gored.

1244
01:43:47,263 --> 01:43:50,308
你也会，你这个贪婪的老鼠混蛋。
So will you, you rapacious rat bastard.

1245
01:43:50,391 --> 01:43:54,020
拉姆齐，你会帮助玛律科姆博士收拾他的东西吗？
Ramsay, will you help Dr. Malcolm
gather his things?

1246
01:43:55,021 --> 01:43:57,231
他的房间，然后到机场。就是这样。
His room, and then to the airfield.
That's it.

1247
01:44:07,158 --> 01:44:08,159
道奇森。
Dodgson.

1248
01:45:41,627 --> 01:45:43,421
异特龙？
Allosaurus?

1249
01:45:44,964 --> 01:45:46,591
巨龙。
Giganotosaurus.

1250
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:48,593
已知最大的陆生食肉动物。
Largest known terrestrial carnivore.

1251
01:45:49,469 --> 01:45:51,929
他把两个顶级捕食者放在一个山谷里。
He put two apex predators in one valley.

1252
01:45:52,013 --> 01:45:53,890
很快，就只有一个了。
Pretty soon there's only gonna be one.

1253
01:46:25,630 --> 01:46:27,090
你感觉到了吗？
Did you feel that?

1254
01:46:29,092 --> 01:46:30,259
那是气流。
That's an air current.

1255
01:46:30,968 --> 01:46:32,804
必须是一个开放的前方。
Must be an opening up ahead.

1256
01:46:33,971 --> 01:46:36,057
你认为这个矿有多少年的历史了？
How old is this mine,
do you think?

1257
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:37,934
呼吸吧。
Just breathe.

1258
01:46:38,017 --> 01:46:40,394
没有人惊慌失措。只要小心蝙蝠。
Nobody panic.
Just watch out for bats.

1259
01:46:40,478 --> 01:46:42,278
- 谁对蝙蝠说过什麽？
- 我讨厌蝙蝠。
- Who said anything about bats?
- I hate bats.

1260
01:46:42,355 --> 01:46:44,774
嗯，可能没有蝙蝠。没有落石。
Well, there's probably no bats.
No falling rocks.

1261
01:46:45,358 --> 01:46:48,277
只是有毒气体，脱水，体温过低的可能性。
Just a possibility of toxic gas,
dehydration, hypothermia.

1262
01:46:48,361 --> 01:46:50,613
只是可能性，没有什麽确定的。
Just possibilities, nothing for certain.

1263
01:46:50,696 --> 01:46:53,866
我应该把你留在原地。我为什麽要把你带进来？
I should've left you where you were.
Why did I bring you into this?

1264
01:46:53,950 --> 01:46:56,828
- 你在你的元素中很快乐。
- 什麽？什麽？艾莉。
- You were happy in your element.
- What? What? Ellie.

1265
01:46:56,911 --> 01:46:57,912
什麽?
What?

1266
01:46:58,746 --> 01:46:59,914
我不高兴。
I wasn't happy.

1267
01:47:01,499 --> 01:47:02,625
你不是吗？
You weren't?

1268
01:47:02,708 --> 01:47:04,710
你们有孩子吗？什麽？
- Do you guys have kids?
- What?

1269
01:47:05,586 --> 01:47:08,798
呃。。。不。我-我做。两个。
Uh... no. I-I do. Two.

1270
01:47:09,382 --> 01:47:10,424
但不是和他在一起吗？
But not with him?

1271
01:47:12,343 --> 01:47:15,012
呃...不。
Uh... no.

1272
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:18,307
不，只是老朋友。
No, just old friends.

1273
01:47:18,850 --> 01:47:20,768
呃，只是老朋友。
Uh, just old friends.

1274
01:47:21,978 --> 01:47:22,979
真?
Really?

1275
01:47:28,025 --> 01:47:30,153
不久之后，保安人员就会知道你已经离开了。
Won't be long
before security knows you're gone.

1276
01:47:30,736 --> 01:47:33,531
地图。这看起来象一张旧地图。您没有新地图？
A map. That looks like an old map.
You don't have a new map?

1277
01:47:33,614 --> 01:47:36,492
在矿井的东北角有一个入口。
There's an access gate
at the northeast corner of the mine.

1278
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:38,202
- 如果你的朋友成功了...
- 如果？
- If your friends make it out...
- If?

1279
01:47:38,286 --> 01:47:39,745
- 当他们成功时。
- 是的,先生。
- When they make it out.
- Yes, sir.

1280
01:47:39,829 --> 01:47:41,080
这就是他们将要去的地方。
That's where they'll be.

1281
01:47:41,831 --> 01:47:43,958
这些道路是受保护的，对吧？
These roads are protected, right?

1282
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:45,293
呃，是的，我会开得快。
Uh, yeah, I'd drive fast.

1283
01:47:57,138 --> 01:47:58,139
你干的很好。
You did good.

1284
01:47:58,222 --> 01:48:01,809
是的。好吧，实际上，这是一场彻底的灾难，但谢谢。
Yeah. Well, actually,
it's a complete disaster, but thanks.

1285
01:48:02,935 --> 01:48:03,978
还没有。
Not yet.

1286
01:48:40,973 --> 01:48:42,350
刘易斯?
Lewis?

1287
01:48:42,433 --> 01:48:44,518
什麽？你在这里做什麽？
What? What are you doing down here?

1288
01:48:46,562 --> 01:48:47,980
其实不然。这很好。
Actually, no. This is good.

1289
01:48:48,064 --> 01:48:51,067
你派了一支救援队进入矿井，寻找格兰特和萨特勒？
You sent a rescue team
into the mines for Grant and Sattler?

1290
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:52,818
是的。什麽？好。答案是肯定的。是的。
Yeah. What? Okay. Of course. Yeah.

1291
01:48:52,902 --> 01:48:56,322
- 是否正在删除研究档？
- 呃，我们是。是的。
- Are you deleting research files?
- Uh, we are. Yes.

1292
01:48:56,405 --> 01:48:59,033
你和我必须保护我们建造的东西，对吧？
You and I got to protect
what we've built, right?

1293
01:48:59,116 --> 01:49:01,953
你认为他们不想把手伸到这里来吗？
You think they wouldn't love
to get their hands in here?

1294
01:49:02,036 --> 01:49:05,456
拿走我花了几十年时间收集的所有资源。
Take all the resources
I've spent decades collecting.

1295
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:06,791
只是因为，什麽？
Just because, what?

1296
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:09,627
我们打了一个糟糕的电话？它发生了。
We made a bad call? It happens.

1297
01:49:10,253 --> 01:49:11,254
七。
Seven.

1298
01:49:14,173 --> 01:49:15,174
六足盟友。
Hexapod Allies.

1299
01:49:15,925 --> 01:49:17,802
什麽？哦。
What? Oh.

1300
01:49:19,595 --> 01:49:22,431
好。人们知道什麽？
Okay. What do people know?

1301
01:49:22,515 --> 01:49:25,851
蝗虫旨在将基因改造传播给农作物。
The locusts were designed to spread
genetic modifications to crops.

1302
01:49:26,936 --> 01:49:29,939
防止干旱，霜冻，疾病。一个突破。
Protection against droughts,
frost, disease. A breakthrough.

1303
01:49:30,022 --> 01:49:32,441
- 该死的，没错。
- 是的。只是它不起作用。
- Goddamn right it was.
- Yeah. Only it didn't work.

1304
01:49:32,525 --> 01:49:35,445
你确保他们不能吃生物合成种子，所以他们吃其他所有东西。
You ensured they can't eat Biosyn seed,
so they're eating everything else.

1305
01:49:35,528 --> 01:49:37,488
我没有看到来。我们有一个解决方案。
Which I did not see coming.
We have a solution.

1306
01:49:37,571 --> 01:49:39,811
- 独立农民起初遭受了痛苦。
- 亨利在上面。
- Independent farmers suffered at first.
- Henry's on it.

1307
01:49:39,865 --> 01:49:42,702
没有人在乎。现在，世界粮食供应正濒临崩溃。
Nobody cared much. Now the world's
food supply is verging on collapse.

1308
01:49:42,785 --> 01:49:44,370
找到女孩，改变蝗虫的DNA。
Find the girl, change the locusts' DNA.

1309
01:49:44,453 --> 01:49:46,914
- 这条小径会回到你身边。
- 我们解决问题。
- The trail's gonna lead back to you.
- We solve the problem.

1310
01:49:46,998 --> 01:49:48,416
拉姆齐，谢谢你。
Ramsay, thank you.

1311
01:49:51,335 --> 01:49:54,797
在下一个新闻周期中消失，就象其他一切一样。事实并非如此。
Disappears in the next news cycle,
just like everything else. This is not it.

1312
01:49:55,464 --> 01:49:56,465
81C1.
81C1.

1313
01:49:56,549 --> 01:49:59,260
或者你可以承担责任。
Or you could accept responsibility.

1314
01:50:00,678 --> 01:50:02,179
与世界分享您的研究成果。
Share your research with the world.

1315
01:50:02,263 --> 01:50:03,264
是的。
Yep.

1316
01:50:04,724 --> 01:50:06,350
你知道，我曾经28岁。我明白了。

I tried. Yeah.

1453
02:06:04,474 --> 02:06:06,559
- 你好吗?
- 这里的那个。
- How you doing?
- The one here.

1454
02:06:07,644 --> 02:06:09,479
你在侏罗纪世界。
You were at Jurassic World.

1455
02:06:10,063 --> 02:06:13,775
侏罗纪世界？不是粉丝。嗯嗯嗯。
Jurassic World? Not a fan.
Mm-mmm.

1456
02:06:14,609 --> 02:06:17,696
好。所以，我们很好找到一条出路？
Okay.
So, we good to find a way out of here?

1457
02:06:17,779 --> 02:06:20,073
- 是的。
- 让我们得到它。
- Yep.
- Let's get it.

1458
02:06:20,156 --> 02:06:23,410
在主建筑群里有一架直升机。
There's a helicopter
out in the main complex.

1459
02:06:23,493 --> 02:06:26,162
我们重新打开ADS，我们回家。
We turn the ADS back on, we go home.

1460
02:06:26,246 --> 02:06:28,707
等。什麽是广告？空中威慑系统。
- Wait. What's an ADS?
- Aerial Deterrent System.

1461
02:06:30,333 --> 02:06:32,752
你知道的？对于翼手龙和狗屎。
You know?
For the pterodactyls and shit.

1462
02:06:32,836 --> 02:06:34,629
让他们远离直升机。
Keeps them away from the helicopters.

1463
02:06:34,713 --> 02:06:36,381
那麽，我们如何重新打开它呢？
Well, how do we turn it back on?

1464
02:06:36,464 --> 02:06:39,551
看起来所有的系统都运行到控制室
It looks like all the systems
run through to the control room,

1465
02:06:39,634 --> 02:06:40,885
位于三楼。
which is on the third floor.

1466
02:06:42,303 --> 02:06:44,514
这些前哨站都连接在地下。
These outposts
are all connected underground.

1467
02:06:50,186 --> 02:06:51,855
好吧。容易，兰博。
All right. Easy, Rambo.

1468
02:07:02,073 --> 02:07:03,950
所以你在猛禽围栏工作，对吧？
So you worked
in the raptor pen, huh?

1469
02:07:04,868 --> 02:07:06,411
是的。
Yeah.

1470
02:07:06,494 --> 02:07:07,579
哇。然后呢？
Wow. And what happens?

1471
02:07:07,662 --> 02:07:10,915
你只是告诉他们该做什麽，他们遵守了吗？或。。。
Do you just tell them what to do
and they comply? Or...

1472
02:07:12,125 --> 02:07:15,837
嗯，这是一种基于相互尊重的人与动物的纽带。
Well, it's a human-animal bond
based on mutual respect.

1473
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:17,380
嗯嗯。
Mm-hmm.

1474
02:07:18,465 --> 02:07:20,592
我曾经养过一只狗。
I had a dog once.

1475
02:07:20,675 --> 02:07:25,346
我的腿哼了起来，我的胫骨上有一根老茧。
Humped my leg so much
I got a callus on my shinbone.

1476
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:26,681
这是一个真实的故事。
That's a true story.

1477
02:07:42,447 --> 02:07:44,824
天啊。嘿。好。
Oh, God. Hey. Good.

1478
02:07:47,077 --> 02:07:49,788
这是我在想的。我们又开始了。
Here's what I'm thinking.
We get started again.

1479
02:07:49,871 --> 02:07:51,873
你和我。我可以得到钱。
You and me.
I can get money.

1480
02:07:53,458 --> 02:07:55,835
是的。如今，钱很便宜。
Yeah. Money's cheap these days.

1481
02:07:55,919 --> 02:07:58,963
Wh-怎么了？不要看起来那麽担心。有...
Wh-What's the matter?
Don't look so worried. There's...

1482
02:07:59,047 --> 02:08:03,259
一切都有机会。E-即使是这个。你会学到这一点。
There's opportunity in everything.
E-Even this. You'll learn that.

1483
02:08:04,010 --> 02:08:07,847
我一直在想，也许你现在会占据更多的领先优势。好？
I've been thinking,
maybe you take more of a lead now. Okay?

1484
02:08:08,723 --> 02:08:09,808
你已经准备好了，我想。
You're ready, I think.

1485
02:08:10,350 --> 02:08:11,351
在这里，采取...
Here, take...

1486
02:08:11,976 --> 02:08:13,645
你到底怎么了？
What the hell
is the matter with you?

1487
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:24,280
是你。
It was you.

1488
02:08:25,073 --> 02:08:27,617
你告诉玛律科姆这个项目。你...
You told Malcolm
about the program. Y-You...

1489
02:08:28,618 --> 02:08:31,371
你把整个事情都设置好了。你设置了我。
You set this whole thing up.
You set me up.

1490
02:08:32,288 --> 02:08:34,666
我给了你每一个我没有的机会。我。。。
I gave you every opportunity
I did not have. I...

1491
02:08:36,125 --> 02:08:40,755
我们有一个理解，拉姆齐。你不会打破它。
We have an understanding, Ramsay.
And you do not break that.

1492
02:08:43,550 --> 02:08:45,176
我不会打破这个。
I would not break this.

1493
02:08:48,513 --> 02:08:49,848
我不是你。
I'm not you.

1494
02:09:02,610 --> 02:09:03,987
哦哦。
Uh-oh.

1495
02:09:05,029 --> 02:09:06,656
这是非常糟糕的。
This is very bad.

1496
02:09:08,491 --> 02:09:10,493
这与我们在公园中使用的系统相同。
This is the same system
we used at the park.

1497
02:09:10,577 --> 02:09:15,373
伟大。所以我们可以打开这个东西，然后我们都离开这里？
Great. So we can turn on the thing
and then we all get out of here?

1498
02:09:15,456 --> 02:09:17,250
我看看。广告。。。
Let's see. ADS...

1499
02:09:18,418 --> 02:09:20,378
这是怎麽？什麽是“错误 99”？
What's this? What's "Error 99"?

1500
02:09:20,461 --> 02:09:22,380
功率不足。
Not enough power.

1501
02:09:22,463 --> 02:09:24,257
在故障中，所有可用电源都被占用
In a breakdown,
all available power is seized

1502
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:26,509
由主系统保持运行。
by the primary system to keep running.

1503
02:09:26,593 --> 02:09:28,761
我们需要所有这些力量来重新启动ADS。
We need all that power
to reactivate the ADS.

1504
02:09:28,845 --> 02:09:30,889
该系统的安全功能是什麽会杀死我们？
The system's safety feature
is what's gonna kill us?

1505
02:09:30,972 --> 02:09:32,265
答案是肯定的。
Of course.

1506
02:09:32,348 --> 02:09:34,183
- 我们如何获得更多权力？
- 我们不能。
- How do we get more power?
- We can't.

1507
02:09:34,267 --> 02:09:36,102
但我们可以重新分配我们所拥有的。
But we can redistribute what we have.

1508
02:09:36,185 --> 02:09:38,105
- 只需要...
- 关闭主系统。
- Just need to...
- Shut down the primary system.

1509
02:09:38,187 --> 02:09:39,397
- 是的。完全。
- 在哪儿?
- Yes. Exactly.
- Where is it?

1510
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:41,608
- 呃，隔壁楼上。
- 我一起去。
- Uh, next floor up.
- I'm coming with you.

1511
02:09:41,691 --> 02:09:43,109
我们逃到了这里。
We escaped down here.

1512
02:09:44,277 --> 02:09:47,947
- 这是哪里？水处理中心？
- 水力发电系统。下八。
- Where is that? Water treatment center?
- Hydroelectric system. Sub eight.

1513
02:09:48,031 --> 02:09:49,657
给我八分锺。我能找到她。
Give me eight minutes.
I could find her.

1514
02:09:49,741 --> 02:09:50,825
等。现在是谁？
Wait. Who's this now?

1515
02:09:50,909 --> 02:09:52,911
试用版。蓝色的宝宝。
Beta. Blue's baby.

1516
02:09:52,994 --> 02:09:54,495
迅猛龙。
Velociraptor.

1517
02:09:54,579 --> 02:09:56,164
- 什麽?
- 小猛禽？
- What?
- A baby raptor?

1518
02:09:56,247 --> 02:09:57,957
你给她起了个名字。怎麽样？
You gave her a name.
How about that?

1519
02:09:58,041 --> 02:09:59,834
我答应了一下，我们会把她带回家。
I made a promise
we would bring her home.

1520
02:09:59,918 --> 02:10:02,795
你对恐龙许下了诺言。
You made a promise
to a dinosaur.

1521
02:10:02,879 --> 02:10:04,505
你和我们一起来，对吧？
You're coming with us, right?

1522
02:10:04,589 --> 02:10:06,174
麦茜，我...
Maisie, I...

1523
02:10:06,257 --> 02:10:07,300
请。
Please.

1524
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:12,555
- 我将在第五频道。
- 好。
- I'll be on channel five.
- Okay.

1525
02:10:12,639 --> 02:10:14,641
我们在三个。
We're on three.

1526
02:10:15,266 --> 02:10:16,267
回来。
Come back.

1527
02:10:17,185 --> 02:10:18,519
我总是回来。
I always come back.

1528
02:10:19,646 --> 02:10:22,440
我会在十天内让那个直升机热。等待我的信号。
I'll have that chopper hot in ten.
Wait for my signal.

1529
02:10:24,567 --> 02:10:26,903
疏散阶段四完成。
Evacuation phase four complete.

1530
02:10:26,986 --> 02:10:28,988
所有生物资产现在都处于遏制状态。
All living assets now in containment.

1531
02:10:37,997 --> 02:10:38,998
加油。
Come on.

1532
02:10:51,552 --> 02:10:53,012
还做噩梦吗？
Still get nightmares?

1533
02:10:53,596 --> 02:10:54,597
一直以来。
All the time.

1534
02:10:55,640 --> 02:10:56,641
你?
You?

1535
02:10:58,017 --> 02:10:59,936
我有很多遗撼。
I have a lot of regrets.

1536
02:11:00,019 --> 02:11:01,020
哦,是的?
Oh, yeah?

1537
02:11:02,522 --> 02:11:03,523
嗯,
Well,

1538
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:07,568
我们坚持后悔，我们停留在过去。
we hold on to regret,
we stay in the past.

1539
02:11:11,197 --> 02:11:12,824
我想，重要的是...
What matters, I guess, is...

1540
02:11:14,534 --> 02:11:15,994
这就是我们现在所做的。
Is what we do now.

1541
02:11:16,619 --> 02:11:18,454
- 正确的?
- 是的。
- Right?
- Yeah.

1542
02:11:24,585 --> 02:11:27,463
啊。
Ah.

1543
02:11:31,259 --> 02:11:32,552
好。
Okay.

1544
02:11:35,888 --> 02:11:37,849
没有人说会有虫子。
Nobody said there'd be bugs.

1545
02:11:40,101 --> 02:11:42,061
B4.她在这里。
B4. She's in here.

1546
02:11:42,937 --> 02:11:46,607
注意侧面。他们总是从侧面来。
Watch the sides.
They always come from the sides.

1547
02:11:48,776 --> 02:11:54,574
你知道，起初我们以为它们会把猎物排出肚子，但事实并非如此。
You know, at first we thought
they disembowel their prey, but no.

1548
02:11:55,783 --> 02:11:58,202
他们足够聪明，可以直接进入喉咙。
They're smart enough
to go straight for the throat.

1549
02:11:59,287 --> 02:12:00,747
静脉，动脉。
The veins, the arteries.

1550
02:12:02,040 --> 02:12:04,167
有时两者同时进行。
Sometimes both at the same time.

1551
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:05,376
好。
Okay.

1552
02:12:07,128 --> 02:12:08,379
好。
Okay.

1553
02:12:08,463 --> 02:12:10,381
我们有你。它就在那条过道上。
We've got you.
It's right down that aisle.

1554
02:12:10,465 --> 02:12:13,265
它就在你所在的过道上。
It's right down that aisle where you are.

1555
02:12:13,301 --> 02:12:14,635
他们为什麽在...
Why are they skulking in...

1556
02:12:14,719 --> 02:12:15,887
你可以为它冲刺。
You can sprint right for it.

1557
02:12:15,970 --> 02:12:18,389
好。在这里。
Okay. Here it is.

1558
02:12:18,473 --> 02:12:20,558
好的，它将是六个网格上的黄色按钮。
Okay, it'll be a yellow button
on a grid of six.

1559
02:12:20,641 --> 02:12:23,436
有一个绿色按钮。是否看到绿色按钮？
There's a green button.
Do you see a green button?

1560
02:12:23,519 --> 02:12:25,271
它不是那个绿色按钮。
It's not that green button.

1561
02:12:25,354 --> 02:12:27,398
从底部开始是四个。在此之上...
It's four from the bottom.
Above this...

1562
02:12:27,482 --> 02:12:28,900
哇，哇，哇。第四个起来了吗？
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Fourth one up?

1563
02:12:28,983 --> 02:12:30,703
第三个向下或第四个向上。同样的事情。
Third one down or fourth one up.
Same thing.

1564
02:12:30,777 --> 02:12:32,028
伊恩，要具体。
Ian, be specific.

1565
02:12:37,283 --> 02:12:38,534
她在这里
She was here.

1566
02:12:39,118 --> 02:12:40,286
灯熄灭。
Lights off.

1567
02:12:46,834 --> 02:12:48,920
我不知道我怎麽可能更具体
I don't know how I could possibly
be more specific

1568
02:12:49,003 --> 02:12:51,756
除了说你想要的那个被标记
other than to say
that the one you want is marked

1569
02:12:51,839 --> 02:12:53,508
- 与“E1”。E1.
- E1.
- with "E1." E1.
- E1.

1570
02:12:55,635 --> 02:12:56,636
E1.
E1.

1571
02:12:57,386 --> 02:12:58,971
是的。
Yeah.

1572
02:13:03,518 --> 02:13:05,686
不。不,不,不,不。
No. No, no, no, no.

1573
02:13:12,318 --> 02:13:14,278
该死。她很快。
Damn it. She's fast.

1574
02:13:16,864 --> 02:13:17,864
嘿!
Hey!

1575
02:13:19,033 --> 02:13:20,451
看着我。
Eyes on me.

1576
02:13:24,956 --> 02:13:27,250
我必须打她的脖子一侧。
I've got to hit her
on the side of her neck.

1577
02:13:27,333 --> 02:13:28,960
麦茜，你要把她的注意力放在心上。
Maisie,
you're gonna hold her focus.

1578
02:13:29,585 --> 02:13:30,586
授予
Grant,

1579
02:13:31,254 --> 02:13:32,380
我们是三角的。
we're triangulating.

1580
02:13:38,344 --> 02:13:39,387
去。
Go.

1581
02:14:08,749 --> 02:14:09,750
对不起，女孩
Sorry, girl.

1582
02:14:10,877 --> 02:14:12,837
我答应过妈，我会让你回家。
I promised your mom
I'd get you home.

1583
02:14:14,172 --> 02:14:16,174
主系统正在重新引导。
Primary system rebooting.
