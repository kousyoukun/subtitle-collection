Twenty-five grand to the first

Come on! Let's go!

18
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,823
One!

19
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,445
Two!

20
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,447
Three!

21
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,742
<i>My name is Jordan Belfort.</i>

22
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,375
<i>Not him.</i>

23
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,269
<i>Me. That's right.</i>

24
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,187
<i>I'm a former member
of the middle class</i>

25
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:49,134
<i>raised by two accountants in a
tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens.</i>

26
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,860
<i>The year I turned 26,</i>

27
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,903
<i>as the head of my
own brokerage firm,</i>

28
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,656
<i>I made $49 million,</i>

29
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,182
<i>which really pissed me off because it
was three shy of a million a week.</i>

30
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,416
<i>No, no, no. My Ferrari was white,</i>

31
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,145
<i>like Don Johnson's in Miami Vice.
Not red.</i>

32
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,217
<i>See that humongous
estate down there?</i>

33
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,661
<i>That's my house.</i>

34
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,304
<i>For millionaires whose ships...</i>

35
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,264
<i>My wife, Naomi,</i>

36
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,642
<i>the Duchess of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn,</i>

37

<i>a former model and
Miller Lite girl.</i>

38
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:26,937
Yeah.

39
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,565
<i>She was the one with my cock
in her mouth in the Ferrari.</i>

40

<i>So put your dick
back in your pants.</i>

41
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,029
<i>In addition to Naomi
and my two perfect kids,</i>

42
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,781
<i>I own a mansion, private jet,</i>

43
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,616
<i>six cars, three horses,</i>

44

<i>Anchors aweigh!</i>

47
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,711
<i>I also gamble like a degenerate.</i>

48
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,879
<i>I drink like a fish.</i>

49
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,924
<i>I fuck hookers maybe five,
six times a week.</i>

50
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,869
<i>I have three different federal
agencies looking to indict me.</i>

51
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,596
<i>Oh, yeah, and I love drugs.</i>

52
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,120
Okay.

53
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,313
- One more round.
- Oh, yeah.

54
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,916
- Oh, you like it?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,934
Pull up. Pull up!
We're gonna crash, for Christ sake!

56
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,394
Relax!

57
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,355
Just relax.

58
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,364
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

59
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,081
Good job.

60
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,748
You get in there safe, all right?

61
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,704
Till the next time, brother.

62
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,251
Till next time.

63
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,155
Yup, on a daily basis
I consume enough drugs

64
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:04,729
to sedate Manhattan,
Long Island and Queens for a month.

65
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,604
Okay, Mr. Jordan.

66
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,499
I take Quaaludes 10 to 15 times
a day for my "back pain,"

67
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,398
Adderall to stay focused,

68
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,379
Xanax to take the edge off,
pot to mellow me out,

69
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,450
cocaine to wake me back up again
and morphine, well,

70
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:19,989
because it's awesome.

71
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,111
Good morning, Nathan.

72
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,454
But of all the drugs
under God's blue heaven,

73
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,798
there is one that is
my absolute favorite.

74
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,091
You see,

75
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,295
enough of this shit'll
make you invincible.

76
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,405
Able to conquer the world,

77
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,133
and eviscerate your enemies.

78
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,302
Ah!

79
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,563
And I'm not talking about this.

80
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,732
I'm talking about this.

81
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,670
<i>See, money doesn't just
buy you a better life,</i>

82
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,215
<i>better food, better
cars, better pussy.</i>

83
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,592
<i>It also makes you a better person.</i>

84
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,385
<i>You can give generously
to the church</i>

85
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,304
<i>or political party of your choice.</i>

86
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,954
<i>You can save the fucking
spotted owl with money.</i>

87
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,499
<i>I always wanted to be rich.
So let me go back.</i>

88
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,983
<i>I'm 22 years old, newly married,</i>

89
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,507
<i>and already a
money-crazed little shit.</i>

90
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:21,779
<i>So what do I do?</i>

91
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,280
<i>I go to the one place on Earth</i>

92
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,679
<i>that befit my
high-minded ambitions.</i>

93
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,970
I love you.

94
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,484
<i>You are lower than pond scum.</i>

95
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,491
You got a problem with that,

96
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,280
Jordan?

97
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,582
No. No problem at all.

98
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,183
Good. Because that is what you are.

99
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,501
Pond scum.

100
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,144
Your job is connector,

101
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:58,023
which means that you'll be dialing
the phone over 500 times a day

102
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,985
trying to connect me
with wealthy business owners.

103
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,028
And until you pass your Series 7,

104
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,322
that is all you're gonna
fucking be doing. Sit.

105
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,549
Sit!

106
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:11,120
Now just so you know,
last year I made over $300,000.

107
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,475
The other guy you'll be working
for, he made over a million.

108
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,458
<i>A million dollars?</i>

109
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,062
<i>I could only imagine
what a douchebag that guy must be.</i>

110
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,278
- Jordan Belfort.
- Yes, sir.

111
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,238
- Mark Hanna.
- A pleasure to meet you.

112
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,862
And you as well. I see you've
already met the village asshole.

113
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,637
Smile and dial.

114
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,116
And don't pick up your
fucking head until 1:00.

115
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,725
Hey, fuck him.

116
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,454
I'm the senior broker here.
He's just a worthless piker.

117
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:36,921
Why don't you blow me, Hanna?

118
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,629
Now did you really pitch a stock
in your job interview?

119
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,586
I had to do something to stand out.
Right, sir?

120
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,089
I fucking love that.

121
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,640
- Lunch. Today.
- Yeah.

122
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,618
We don't start dialing at 9:30

123
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,537
because our clients are
already answering the phone.

124
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,165
Three. Two. One.

125
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,267
Let's fuck!

126
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,003
<i>You want to know
what money sounds like?</i>

127
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,047
<i>Go to a trading floor
on Wall Street.</i>

128
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,590
<i>"Fuck" this, "shit" that.</i>

129
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,091
<i>"Cunt, " "cock," "asshole. "</i>

130
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,385
<i>I couldn't believe how these
guys talked to each other.</i>

131
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,762
- Good fucking package...
- Piece of shit!

132
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,536
<i>I was hooked in seconds.</i>

133
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,618
<i>It was like mainlining adrenaline.</i>

134
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,124
Yeah. Fuckface, look at where
the stock's at today, huh?

135
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,790
You motherfucker,
you can't get any at 44...

136
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,376
- Pick up the cocksucking phone!
- Sorry...

137
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,213
You are such a fucking
douchebag, Hanna.

138
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,199
We don't give two shits
about how technology works

139
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,928
because all we care about
is getting fucking rich.

140
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,305
- Solid, 2,000.
- Jordan Belfort.

141
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,807
Done!

142
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,209
Time to paint the tape. Whoo!

143
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,689
2,000. Microsoft.
Going in the hole!

144
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,197
Come on.

145
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,989
Live. Live. Hold on, that is hot.

146
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,720
In. In. Shut that motherfucker.

147
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,993
Shut it! Shut it! Shut it!

148
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,206
Sold!

149
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,681
Yeah.

150
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,102
Tootski?

151
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,195
Oh, no. Thank you, though.

152
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,198
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you
on this glorious afternoon?

153
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,659
Well, Hector, here's the game plan.

154
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,261
You're gonna bring us
two Absolut martinis.

155
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,013
You know howl like them.
Straight up.

156
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,724
And then precisely seven
and one half minutes after that,

157
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,183
you're gonna bring us two more.

158
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,520
Then two more after that
every five minutes

159
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,715
until one of us
passes the fuck out.

160
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,383
Excellent strategy, sir.

161
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,261
I'm good with water for now.

162
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,720
Thank you.

163
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,716
It's his first day on Wall Street.
Give him time.

164
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,518
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

165
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,811
Mr. Hanna?

166
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,998
You're able to do
drugs during the day

167
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,522
and then still function,
still do your job?

168
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,961
How the fuck else would
you do this job?

169
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,905
Cocaine and hookers, my friend.

170
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,695
Right.

171
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,801
Well, I got to say,
I'm incredibly excited

172
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,075
to be a part of your firm.
I mean...

173
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,681
The clients you have
are absolutely...

174
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,079
Fuck the clients.

175
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,917
Your only responsibility
is to put meat on the table.

176
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,127
You got a girlfriend?

177
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,815
I'm married. I have a wife.

178
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,964
Her name is Teresa. She cuts hair.

179
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,360
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

180
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,804
Think about Teresa.

181
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,072
Name of the game.

182
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,928
Move the money from your client's
pocket into your pocket.

183
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,118
Right.

184
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,870
But if you make your clients money
at the same time,

185
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,269
it's advantageous to
everyone. Correct?

186
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,066
No.

187
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,895
Number one rule of Wall Street.

188
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,068
Nobody...

189
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,465
I don't care if you're Warren
Buffett or if you're Jimmy Buffett.

190
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,176
Nobody knows if a
stock is gonna go up,

191
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,178
down, sideways,
or in fucking circles.

192
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,347
- Least of all stockbrokers, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

193
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,891
It's all a fugazi.
You know what a fugazi is?

194
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:03,040
Uh. Fugayzi. It's a fake.

195
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,896
Fugayzi, fugazi, it's a whazy,
it's a woozy, it's...

196
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,357
Fairy dust. It doesn't exist.

197
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,359
It's never landed. It is no matter.

198
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,819
It's not on the elemental chart.

199
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,904
It's not fucking real.

200
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,302
- Right?
- Right.

201
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,262
- Stay with me.
- Mmm-hmm.

202
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,019
We don't create shit.
We don't build anything.

203
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,120
No.

204
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,164
So if you got a client
who bought stock at 8

205
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,688
and it now sits at 16,
he's all fucking happy.

206
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,127
He wants to cash in, liquidate,

207
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,878
take his fucking
money and run home.

208
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,902
- You don't let him do that.
- Okay.

209
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,866
- 'Cause that would make it real.
- Right.

210
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,217
No. What do you do?

211
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,070
You get another brilliant idea.

212
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,762
A special idea.

213
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,265
Another "situation." Another stock

214
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,392
to reinvest his
earnings and then some.

215
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,712
And he will, every single time.

216
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,751
'Cause they're fucking addicted.

217
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,858
And you just keep doing this,
again and again and again.

218
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,819
Meanwhile,
he thinks he's getting shit rich,

219
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,797
which he is, on paper.

220
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,739
But you and me, the brokers,

221
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,616
we're taking home cold hard cash

222
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,970
via commission, motherfucker.

223
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,645
Right.

224
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,915
That's incredible, sir.

225
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,393
I can't tell you how excited I am.

226
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,690
You should be.

227
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:13,566
There's two keys to success
in the broker business.

228
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,024
First of all...

229
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,112
- You gotta stay relaxed.
- Yeah.

230
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,829
Do you jerk off?

231
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,807
Do I... Do I jerk off?

232
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,127
Yeah. Yeah, I jerk off. Yeah.

233
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,541
How many times a week?

234
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,439
Like, um, three or four.

235
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,773
Three or four times, maybe five.

236
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,816
Gotta pump those numbers up.

237
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,152
Those are rookie numbers
in this racket.

238
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:39,053
I myself, I jerk off
at least twice a day.

239
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,782
- Wow.
- Once in the morning

240
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,227
right after I work out,
then once right after lunch.

241
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,846
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

242
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,516
I want to. That's not why I do it.

243
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,855
I do it 'cause I fucking need to.

244
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,461
Think about it.
You're dealing with numbers.

245
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,505
All day long,
decimal points, high frequencies.

246
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,607
Bang, bang, bang.

247
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,152
Fucking digits.

248
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:02,429
All very acidic
above-the-shoulders mustard shit.

249
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,782
- All right?
- Mmm-hmm.

250
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,140
It kind of wigs some people out.

251
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,266
- Mmm-hmm.
- Right.

252
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,643
You got to feed the geese
to keep the blood flowing.

253
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:08,685
Mmm-hmm.

254
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,520
I keep the rhythm below the belt.

255
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,813
Done.

256
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,398
This is not a tip, this
is a prescription.

257
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,625
- Trust me.
- Mmm-hmm.

258
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,236
If you don't, you will
fall out of balance,

259
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,446
split your differential
and tip the fuck over.

260
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,822
Or worse yet,

261
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,641
I've seen this happen, implode.

262
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,743
No, I don't want to implode, sir.

263
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,953
No. No, you don't.

264
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,246
I'm in it for the
long run, you know?

265
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,849
- Implosions are ugly.
- Yeah.

266
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,166
Pop off to the bathroom,
work one out any time you can.

267
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,251
When you get really good at it,

268
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,276
you'll fucking be stroking it
and you'll be thinking about money.

269
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:40,634
Second key to success
in this racket

270
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,969
is this little baby right here.

271
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,447
It's called cocaine.

272
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:44,930
Right.

273
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,890
It'll keep you sharp
between the ears.

274
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,959
It'll also help your
fingers dial faster.

275
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,203
And guess what?

276
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,122
That's good for me.

277
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,627
Yes, sir.

278
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,171
Revolutions. You follow?

279
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,293
Revolutions.

280
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,569
Keep the clients on
the Ferris wheel.

281
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,198
And it goes. The park
is open 24/7, 365,

282
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,223
every decade, every
goddamn century.

283
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,641
That's it.

284
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,518
The name of the game.

285
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,146
Halkidiki?

286
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,852
- Hmm.
- Thank you.

287
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,656
Come on.

288
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,541
We're the common denominator.

289
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,675
Ah.

290
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,012
Ah.

291
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,965
Keep it up for me.

292
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,949
<i>You've seen the echo</i>

293
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,643
<i>And the money comes in</i>

294
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,120
<i>The parade comes to town</i>

295
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,955
<i>Going down Broadway</i>

296
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,623
<i>It's a one-way street</i>

297
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,021
<i>Whichever way I go</i>

298
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,255
<i>The next six months,</i>

299
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,674
<i>I got to know the ins and outs
of Wall Street.</i>

300
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,370
<i>Earning shit money as I geared up
to take my Series 7.</i>

301
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,208
Oh!

302
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,369
Oh, fuckers.

303
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,714
Oh!

304
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:24,446
<i>Then I was a licensed
broker at last,</i>

305
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,531
<i>ready to make my fortune.</i>

306
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:31,229
<i>My first day as a future
Master of the Universe.</i>

307
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,821
I have Exxon at 86
1/4 six months ago.

308
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,256
Today it is trading at 36 1/2.

309
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,529
Mr...

310
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,889
<i>They called it Black Monday.</i>

311
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,182
<i>No shit.</i>

312
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:56,311
<i>By 4:00 p.m., the market
had dropped 508 points.</i>

313
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,256
<i>The biggest plummet
since the crash of '29.</i>

314
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,732
I know your family, you know mine.

315
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,819
No, I don't know. Some fucking
country in Europe took a shit.

316
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,237
Let them do
what they want to fucking do.

317
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,571
Our market's solid.

318
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,299
This is not something
that you want to sell.

319
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,097
You know what happened?
A fucking tsunami.

320
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,243
I think you're making
a big mistake.

321
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,828
Yes, I will talk to your wife.

322
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,538
Trust me, do not answer the phone.

323
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,956
A lot of people are
gonna be calling you,

324
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,149
trying to get your dirty laundry.

325
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,417
We don't know what's going on here.

326
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,770
I know. I know.

327
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,198
Holy

328
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,118
fucking shit!

329
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,520
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

330
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,064
<i>My first shitty day as a broker.</i>

331
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,525
<i>Within a month, L.F. Rothschild,</i>

332
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:48,382
<i>an institution since
1899, closed its doors.</i>

333
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,866
<i>Wall Street had swallowed me up</i>

334
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,345
<i>and shit me right back out again.</i>

335
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,999
We could pawn my engagement ring
if we needed to.

336
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,584
- Babe...
- Because I don't mind.

337
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,751
If we needed to, I'm saying...

338
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,378
- Will you listen to me?
- Okay.

339
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,607
You're not pawning anything. Okay?

340
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,048
- Okay.
- What do I always tell you?

341
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,249
You're gonna be a millionaire.

342
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,737
That's right. Okay?
Just let me look.

343
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,034
We'll find something.

344
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,763
- How about this?
- What?

345
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,308
Nobody Beats the Wiz,
the electronics store.

346
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,626
Stock boy. What do you think?

347
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,207
You're not gonna
work at that place.

348
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,312
Yeah, but, you know,
you start off...

349
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,480
Jordan, you're gonna be
miserable at that place

350
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,564
- if you go there.
- I know.

351
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,815
It's sales. You work your way up,

352
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,025
you'll be a general manager.

353
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,735
- You're not gonna be a stock boy.
- Why not?

354
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,258
'Cause you're a stockbroker.

355
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,132
You understand that nobody's
hiring stockbrokers right now?

356
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,509
You understand that?

357
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,180
Okay?

358
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,186
Ah. This place is.

359
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,477
- What?
- What's that say?

360
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:43,853
"Stockbrokers."

361
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:46,796
In Long Island?
Stockbrokers in Long Island?

362
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,023
Yeah.

363
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,193
<i>It's in Long Island. So what?</i>

364
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:12,011
Hey, uh, I'm looking
for Investor's Center.

365
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,930
What's that? You want to invest?

366
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,785
No. Investor's Center.

367
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,058
I'm looking for Investor's Center.

368
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,747
Yeah, yeah, that's us. Hey.
This is it. This is it.

369
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,790
Oh.

370
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,458
- I'm Dwayne. Yeah.
- You're Dwayne?

371
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,402
Hi, Dwayne. We spoke on the phone.

372
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,063
I'm Jordan Belfort.

373
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,407
I'm the broker from Rothschild
in New York.

374
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,241
Yes, yeah. Have a seat.
How are you?

375
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,801
We had a conversation...

376
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,135
We spoke on the phone
earlier, right?

377
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,554
- Two hours ago.
- Right.

378
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,656
Yeah.

379
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,788
They're up and comers.
That's what that means.

380
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,686
It's 3 cents a share, that's $3!

381
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,255
You cheap fuck!

382
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,189
So, uh...

383
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,918
So where are your Quotrons here?

384
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,194
- Quotrons?
- Yeah. Your computers.

385
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,571
No, no.
We don't even need computers here.

386
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,390
We just trade right off
the pink sheets here.

387
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,266
- Pink sheets?
- Yeah, they're penny stocks.

388
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,201
You know, uh, companies that
can't get listed on NASDAQ,

389
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,474
they don't have enough capital?

390
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,662
Their shares trade here.

391
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,436
- Penny stocks?
- Yeah.

392
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,417
This one, uh, Aerodyne,
is a really interesting...

393
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,876
Or Aerotyne...

394
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,445
Aerotyne, yeah.

395
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,156
Aero... Aerotyne...

396
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,590
Aerotyne. Yeah.

397
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:12,799
Very hot stock right now.

398
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,883
Oh, yeah?

399
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,176
They're just a couple of brothers
that are making

400
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,595
radar detectors out
of their garage.

401
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,679
They're out in Dubuque.

402
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,014
Maybe it's microwaves.
I'm not sure.

403
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,515
But you call the
company's main line,

404
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,434
their mom, Dorothy, answers
and she is so sweet.

405
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,436
- Good company.
- I actually don't know what else to...

406
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,557
I don't know anything else
about them other than that.

407
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,962
Six cents a share?

408
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,795
Hey, come on. Who buys this crap?

409
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,008
Well, I mean...

410
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,404
Honestly, mostly schmucks.

411
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,507
Postmen, there's always postmen.

412
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,491
Uh, plumbers. Um...

413
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,035
They see our ads in
the back of, uh,

414
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,620
<i>Hustler and Popular Mechanics.</i>

415
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,565
Our ads actually say
they can get rich quick.

416
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,832
<i>- Hustler?</i>
- Yeah.

417
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,125
You know, those girlie magazines.

418
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,694
Yeah, yeah. Nudie mag.

419
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:49,878
- A lot.
- Yeah.

420
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,588
We're helping them finance houses,

421
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,548
we're helping them buy
their wife a diamond ring...

422
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,716
A boat maybe.

423
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,661
Is this... Is this stuff
regulated or are you guys...

424
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,870
What are you doing here?

425
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:00,948
Uh...

426
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,749
Sort of.

427
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:03,993
Sort of?

428
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,229
Jesus Christ,
the spread on these is huge.

429
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,606
Yeah. And that's
the point, that's...

430
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:10,774
What's your name again?

431
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,172
Mine... Jordan Belfort.

432
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,132
Jordan, what do you get
on that blue chip stock?

433
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,257
I make one percent.
Or I did make one percent.

434
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,224
Pink sheets, it's 50.

435
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,388
It's 50%?

436
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,602
50% commission?

437
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,191
- Yup.
- For what?

438
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,568
It's our markup for our services.

439
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,379
And so if I... If I...

440
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,610
if I sell a stock at $10,000,
my commission is 5,000 bucks?

441
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,135
If you sell $10,000
worth of this stock,

442
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,409
I will personally give you
a blowjob for free.

443
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,849
And I hope it happens.

444
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,946
<i>Hello, John,
how are you doing today?</i>

445
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,606
You mailed in my company
a postcard a few weeks back

446
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,400
requesting information
on penny stocks

447
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,527
that had huge upside potential

448
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,278
with very little downside risk.

449
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,280
- Does that ring a bell?
<i>- Yeah, I may have sent something.</i>

450
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,492
Okay, great. The reason for
the call today, John, is,

451
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,221
something just came
across my desk, John.

452
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,621
It is perhaps the best thing

453
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,123
I've seen in the last six months.

454
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,999
If you have 60 seconds,
I'd like to share

455
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,292
the idea with you.
You got a minute?

456
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,419
<i>Actually, I'm really very...</i>

457
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,963
The name of the company,
Aerotyne International.

458
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:18,318
It is a cutting edge high-tech firm
out of the Midwest

459
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,385
<i>awaiting imminent patent approval</i>

460
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,971
on the next generation
of radar detectors

461
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:27,578
that have both huge military
and civilian applications now.

462
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,977
Right now, John,

463
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,438
the stock trades over-the-counter
at 10 cents a share.

464
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,815
And by the way, John,
our analysts indicate

465
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,192
it could go a heck of
a lot higher than that.

466
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,237
Your profit on a mere
$6,000 investment

467
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,262
would be upwards of $60,000!

468
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,867
<i>Jesus! That's my mortgage, man.</i>

469
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,535
Exactly.
You could pay off your mortgage.

470
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,120
<i>This stock will pay off my house?</i>

471
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,997
John, one thing I can promise you,

472
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,315
even in this market,

473
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,125
is that I never ask my clients

474
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,603
to judge me on my winners.

475
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:57,573
I ask them to judge me on my losers
because I have so few.

476
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,215
And in the case of Aerotyne,

477
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,926
based on every technical
factor out there, John,

478
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,156
we are looking at
a grand slam home run.

479
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,099
<i>Okay, let's do it. I'll do 4 grand.</i>

480
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,419
$4,000? That'd be
40,000 shares, John.

481
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:11,936
Let me lock in that trade right now

482
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,313
and get back to you
with my secretary

483
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,315
with an exact confirmation.
Sound good, John?

484
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,668
<i>- Yeah, sounds good.</i>
- Great.

485
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:17,901
Hey, John.

486
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,549
Thank you for your
vote of confidence.

487
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,529
And welcome to the
Investor's Center.

488
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,677
<i>Yeah, thanks a lot, man.</i>

489
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,099
Bye-bye.

490
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,162
How'd you fucking do that?

491
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,917
<i>Just like that, I made 2 grand.</i>

492
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,817
<i>The other guys looked at me
like I'd just discovered fire.</i>

493
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,611
Great! Even better!

494
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,716
<i>I was selling garbage
to garbage men</i>

495
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,319
<i>and making cash hand over fist.</i>

496
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,074
The only problem you're gonna
have is that you didn't buy more.

497
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:47,972
Boom shocka locka!

498
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,016
<i>So I was selling them shit.</i>

499
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:53,520
<i>But the way I looked at it, their
money was better off in my pocket.</i>

500
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,464
<i>I knew how to spend it better.</i>

501
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,213
<i>Excuse me.
Is that your car in the lot?</i>

502
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,717
Yeah.

503
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,754
<i>- It's a nice ride.
- Thanks, man.</i>

504
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,009
Donnie Azoff.

505
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,155
Hey. I'm Jordan Belfort.

506
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,517
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

507
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,408
You know, actually,
I see that car around.

508
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,182
- I see it around a lot.
- Oh, yeah, where?

509
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,079
I think we live in
the same building.

510
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,247
- No shit?
- Yeah, yeah.

511
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,066
- Twelfth floor?
- Yeah. What floor are you on?

512
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,250
Fourth floor.

513
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,194
- I have two little kids. Ugly wife.
- Right.

514
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,193
What do you do, bro?

515
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,196
What do you mean, what do I do?

516
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,467
For work, what do you do?

517
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,694
I'm a stockbroker.

518
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,576
- Stockbroker?
- Yeah.

519
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,244
Children's furniture.

520
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,598
Oh, good for you.

521
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,042
It's all right.

522
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,620
You make a lot of money?

523
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,755
Yeah, I do all right for myself.

524
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,089
I'm trying to put it together.

525
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,566
You got your fucking nice car,

526
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,109
we live in the same
building. I just...

527
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,804
I'm not understanding...
How much money do you make?

528
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,683
I don't know. $70,000 last month.

529
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,560
Get the fuck...

530
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,390
Get the fuck out of here.

531
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,767
No, I'm serious.

532
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,060
Yeah, no, I'm serious, too.

533
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,225
Seriously,
how much money do you make?

534
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,565
I told you. $70,000.

535
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,234
Well, technically, $72,000.

536
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,240
Last month. Something like that.

537
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,301
You made 72 grand in one month?

538
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,574
Yeah.

539
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,291
I'll tell you what.

540
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,477
You show me a pay stub
for $72,000 on it,

541
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,831
I quit my job right now
and I work for you.

542
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,305
<i>Hey, Paulie, what's up?</i>

543
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,721
No, yeah, yeah.
No, everything's fine.

544
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,219
Hey, listen, I quit.

545
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,179
<i>And he did quit his job.</i>

546
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,454
<i>Which I thought was a little weird.</i>

547
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,228
<i>I mean, I just met
this fucking guy.</i>

548
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,188
Don't fucking tell Susan.
It's none of her business.

549
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,584
<i>There were other
things about him, too.</i>

550
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,794
<i>Like his phosphorescent
white teeth.</i>

551
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,046
wife! I gotta fucking
deal with your wife?

552
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,298
<i>The fact that he wore horn rims
with clear lenses</i>

553
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,151
<i>just to look more WASP-y.</i>

554
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,287
<i>And then, there were these rumors.</i>

555
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,014
I heard some stupid shit.
I don't know.

556
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,413
Fuck, I didn't even want
to bring it up. It's just...

557
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,460
- it's stupid.
- Shit with me?

558
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,687
You know, people say shit.
I don't even know.

559
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,211
I don't even listen
to it half the time.

560
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,876
What are they saying?

561
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,362
Shit about you and your cousin
or something like that.

562
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:08,696
I don't even listen to it.

563
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,346
Oh, bro, it's not like that.

564
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,684
It's not like that.

565
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,687
Like you married your cousin
or some stupid shit. No?

566
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,664
Yeah, my wife. Yeah.

567
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,582
My wife is my cousin, or whatever.

568
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,186
But it's not like what you think,
or whatever, you know.

569
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,362
Is she like a first
cousin, or is she...

570
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,546
Yeah, no, she's, you know...

571
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,570
Her... Her father

572
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,490
is the brother of my mom.

573
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,203
It's not like, what... You know.

574
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,538
Look, we grew up together.

575
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:36,224
And she grew up hot, you know.
She fucking grew up hot.

576
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,059
And all my friends were
trying to fuck her, you know.

577
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,753
And I'm not gonna let someone...

578
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,729
You know, one of these
assholes fuck my cousin,

579
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,815
so, you know, I used
the cousin thing

580
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,293
as like an in with her.

581
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,860
I'm not gonna let someone
else fuck my cousin.

582
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,612
You know,
if anyone's gonna fuck my cousin,

583
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,572
it's gonna be me, out of respect.
You know?

584
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,740
No, I get it. Yeah.

585
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,060
I mean, you're not afraid of
like the whole kid thing, right?

586
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,327
- What? Having kids with her?
- Yeah.

587
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,645
No. We have two kids.

588
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,163
And they're... I mean...

589
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,833
I don't want to get personal,
but they're okay?

590
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,028
No, they're not retarded
or anything like that.

591
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,029
But there's a big
chance, right, if...

592
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,423
Yeah, there's like a 60%, you know,

593
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:12,028
60 to 65% chance the kid's gonna
be fucking retarded or whatever.

594
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,244
That'd scare the shit
out of me, buddy.

595
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,638
Look, man, a lot of having a kid,
or whatever, takes risk,

596
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,432
whether you're fucking
cousins or not.

597
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:20,268
What if something
like that happened?

598
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,936
Basically, you know,
if the kid was retarded,

599
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,356
I would, you know,
drive it up to the country

600
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,108
and just, like, you know,
open the door and say,

601
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,382
"You're free now."
You know, like, "Run free."

602
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,879
You know?

603
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,160
You're completely fucking with me.

604
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,728
That's horrible.
You're not gonna...

605
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,416
You look like you've... No.

606
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,334
We would take it to,
like, an institution or somewhere

607
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,586
that's handled to, like, you know,

608
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,234
raise the kid or whatever.

609
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,840
You know what? If you're
happy, God bless you, buddy.

610
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,008
No, I'm not fucking happy.

611
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,237
No one who's married
is fucking happy.

612
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:55,905
Well, I'm sorry to
hear that, buddy.

613
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,181
Listen, I'm really, you know...

614
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,580
I'm really appreciative
for this fucking job.

615
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,851
I'm really enjoying it.

616
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,352
I'm really happy with
what you're doing.

617
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,501
Actually, I got you
a little present.

618
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,231
- You got me a present?
- I got you something.

619
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,584
Oh, fuck. You're sweet.

620
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,850
Yeah. It's in the back though.

621
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,425
- What do you mean?
- You gotta go out back.

622
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,806
Like it's wrapped up or something?

623
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,365
It's wrapped up. Yeah.

624
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,575
- I don't get it.
- Neither do I.

625
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,144
Let's fucking go. Come on.

626
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,329
Your turn.

627
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,413
I'm not fucking doing this.

628
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,561
You're out of your fucking mind.

629
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,583
- Smoke this shit, bro.
- No.

630
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,668
No one's fucking here, bro.

631
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,816
Get the fuck...

632
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,671
Fucking smoke crack with me, bro.

633
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,839
I'm not fucking doing it.

634
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,675
Smoke crack. Smoke some
fucking crack with me, bro.

635
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,120
- One hit. One hit. That's it.
- Okay.

636
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,114
Fucking nut job.

637
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,896
Wow!

638
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,649
Wow.

639
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,697
Let's go run, huh?

640
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,903
We gotta get out of here, buddy.

641
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,717
We gotta get out of here.
Let's go fucking run.

642
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:20,288
Let's run like we're fucking lions
and tigers and bears!

643
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,828
Let's run! Let's fucking run!

644
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,960
Let's fucking run! Go!

645
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,394
Go, go, go, go!

646
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,856
<i>You've reached
Frank's Best Auto Body.</i>

647
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,399
<i>We're closed right now.</i>

648
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,502
<i>So please leave us a message.</i>

649
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,278
<i>Hello. My name is Jordan Belfort.</i>

650
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,739
<i>My partner and I are very interested
in renting out your garage.</i>

651
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,325
<i>Donnie and I were
going out on our own.</i>

652
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,744
<i>And the first thing
we needed was brokers.</i>

653
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,746
<i>Guys with sales experience.</i>

654
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,748
<i>So I recruited some
of my hometown boys.</i>

655
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,792
<i>Sea Otter, who sold meat</i>

656
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,002
<i>and weed.</i>

657
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,296
<i>Chester, who sold tires</i>

658
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:54,463
<i>and weed.</i>

659
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,408
<i>And Robbie, who sold anything
he could get his hands on.</i>

660
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,781
<i>Mostly weed.</i>

661
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,409
Can you bring me some ketchup?
Okay?

662
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:02,889
<i>This is Brad.</i>

663
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,640
<i>And Brad's the guy
I really wanted.</i>

664
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,975
<i>But he didn't go along with us.</i>

665
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:08,603
<i>He was already making so much
money selling Quaaludes,</i>

666
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,439
<i>he'd become the Quaalude king
of Bayside.</i>

667
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,607
Getting any pussy
with that thing or what?

668
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:13,649
Yeah, man, of course.

669
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,610
Bring some of them chicks
around here sometime, huh?

670
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:16,986
Let 'em watch.

671
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,930
Let 'em watch. Know what I mean?

672
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:23,018
Hey, Zip! You tell your sister
I was asking about her.

673
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,264
Why don't you bring me a pair of her
panties next time you come through.

674
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:29,183
Yeah, man. She said she don't
want to talk to you anymore, man.

675
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,614
Get the fuck out of here.

676
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,736
Hey, Ma, we got chicken or what?

677
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,822
Ma!

678
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,483
You listening?
It's easier than you think.

679
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,967
Every person you're
on the phone with,

680
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,595
they want to get rich
and they want to get rich quickly.

681
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:43,804
They all want something
for nothing.

682
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,390
There was this one time that I was
selling pot to this Amish dude.

683
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,850
You know those guys
who got like the beard

684
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,999
with like no mustache
or some bullshit?

685
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:53,924
Well, he says that he only
wants to make furniture.

686
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:55,524
I don't understand.

687
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,797
What's that
got to do with anything?

688
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,758
What the fuck are
you talking about?

689
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,696
I'm not putting words
in your mouth or nothing,

690
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,926
but you just said that
everybody wants to get rich.

691
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,470
Holy fuck, you did just say that.

692
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,829
What the fuck are
you talking about?

693
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,997
Yeah, like Buddhists.

694
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,040
They don't give a shit about money.

695
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,125
They're wrapped in sheets.
They're not buying shit.

696
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,961
I'm not talking about
Buddhists or Amish.

697
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,420
I'm talking about normal people,

698
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,797
working-class, everyday people.

699
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:19,799
Everyone wants to
get rich. Am I crazy?

700
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,175
There's no such thing
as an Amish Buddhist.

701
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,119
- I'm pretty fucking sure.
- There could be.

702
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,471
Can we get some ketchup, please?

703
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,931
Do you guys not want to make money?

704
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,724
I want to make some money.

705
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,142
I want to make some
fucking money, okay.

706
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,460
I can sell anything.

707
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,521
Shit, I can sell ludes
to a convent full of nuns,

708
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,522
and get them so horny
they'd be fucking each other.

709
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,463
That's the attitude.
You can sell anything?

710
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,151
Sell me this fucking
pen right here.

711
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,903
You can sell anything.
Sell that. Go ahead.

712
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,176
Sell me the pen.

713
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,966
Can I finish eating first?
I haven't eaten today.

714
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,431
Brad, show them how
it's done. Boom.

715
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,974
Sell me that pen. Watch. Go on.

716
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,621
You want me to sell
this fucking pen?

717
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,975
That's my boy right there.
Can fucking sell anything.

718
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,208
Why don't you do me a favor.

719
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,889
Write your name down
on that napkin for me.

720
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,086
I don't have a pen.

721
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,155
Exactly. Supply and
demand, my friend.

722
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,298
Holy shit.

723
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,590
See what I'm saying?
He's creating urgency.

724
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,009
Get them to want to buy the stock.

725
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,885
Convince them it's something
they need, you know what I mean?

726
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,238
And that's the thing.

727
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:07,990
All nuns are lesbians.

728
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,849
What the fuck are you
talking about, Otter?

729
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,475
Think about it.
They can't keep a dude

730
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,727
so they're gonna start
fucking chicks.

731
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,001
Four fucking times,
Kimmie! Four times.

732
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,480
- He's not with us.
- Friggin' Rambo.

733
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,924
Now she runs.

734
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,885
<i>But look. I knew these
guys weren't like Harvard MBAs.</i>

735
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,570
<i>Robbie Feinberg, the pinhead,</i>

736
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,864
<i>took five years to
finish high school.</i>

737
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,699
<i>Alden Kupferberg, the Sea Otter,</i>

738
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,892
<i>didn't even graduate.</i>

739
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,077
<i>Chester Ming, the
depraved Chinaman,</i>

740
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,226
<i>thought jujitsu was in Israel.</i>

741
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,749
<i>Smartest of the bunch
was Nicky Koskoff.</i>

742
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,500
<i>He actually went to law school.</i>

743
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:40,026
<i>I called him Rugrat because of
his piece of shit hairpiece.</i>

744
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,924
<i>Still, give them to me young,
hungry and stupid</i>

745
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,074
<i>and in no time,
I'll make them rich.</i>

746
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,494
Oh, my God.

747
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,874
Jordan, that...

748
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,267
You like it, baby?

749
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,120
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

750
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,605
They're not the biggest stones
in the world,

751
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,583
but I promise they're
really high quality.

752
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,838
It's beautiful.

753
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,920
They're so beautiful.

754
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:04,634
Oh, boy.

755
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,113
What?

756
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,699
I know that look.
What is it? Go ahead.

757
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,427
I don't know, it's... You know...

758
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,350
These stocks... These companies...

759
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,456
They're like crappy companies.

760
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,854
- Well, yeah.
- Okay.

761
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,318
Yeah, they're terrible.

762
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,461
Don't worry about it. I told you,

763
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:21,862
what I'm doing is completely legal.

764
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,963
Yeah, I know.

765
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,237
But they're not gonna make
anyone money though, right?

766
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,094
Well, sometimes they do,
sometimes they don't.

767
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,572
You know how it goes.

768
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,223
Wouldn't you feel better if you
sold that stuff to rich people

769
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,577
who can, like,
afford to lose all that money?

770
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,583
Of course.

771
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,711
But rich people don't
buy penny stocks.

772
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:42,668
They just don't.

773
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:44,295
Why not?

774
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,155
<i>Because they're too smart,</i>

775
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,508
<i>that's why not.</i>

776
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:52,535
<i>I mean, what person with
a college education</i>

777
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:53,911
<i>would trust this
bunch of jerk-offs?</i>

778
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,162
Hang up the phone.
Tell him you'll call him back.

779
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,330
I got 5 fucking grand
on the phone right now!

780
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,581
Hey!

781
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,626
<i>But what if they didn't sound
like a bunch of jerk-offs?</i>

782
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,947
<i>What if I could teach them
how to sell to people with money?</i>

783
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,527
<i>Real money.</i>

784
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,034
<i>So I decided to
reinvent the company.</i>

785
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,454
Gentlemen, welcome

786
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:13,366
to Stratton Oakmont.

787
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,291
You schnooks will now be targeting

788
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,503
the wealthiest 1% of Americans.

789
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,630
We're talking about whales here.

790
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,624
Moby fucking Dicks.

791
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:26,861
And with this script,
which is now your new harpoon,

792
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:29,071
I'm gonna teach
each and every one of you

793
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,800
to be Captain fucking Ahab.

794
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,555
Get it? Huh?

795
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:34,803
Captain who?

796
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,472
Captain Ahab. From the fucking...

797
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,149
The book, motherfucker.
From the book.

798
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,209
Turn your fucking brain on.

799
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,627
- Fuck you.
- Jesus fuck, Robbie.

800
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,698
Listen to me. We're a
new company with a new name.

801
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:49,785
A company that our
clients can believe in.

802
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,863
A company that our
clients can trust.

803
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:57,641
A firm whose roots are
so deeply embedded into Wall Street

804
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:01,145
that our very founders sailed over
on the Mayflower

805
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,044
and chiseled the name
Stratton Oakmont

806
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,462
right into Plymouth fucking Rock!

807
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,169
You got it?

808
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,069
What we're gonna do is this.

809
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,364
First we pitch 'em
Disney, AT&T, IBM,

810
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,325
blue chip stocks exclusively.

811
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,599
Companies these people know.

812
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:20,691
Once we've suckered them in,
we unload the dog shit.

813
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,875
The pink sheets, the penny stocks,

814
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,523
where we make the money.

815
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,730
- 50% commission, baby.
- Ooh.

816
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,840
Now the key to making money
in a situation like this

817
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,945
is to position yourself now
before the settlement.

818
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:35,930
Because by the time you read about
it in <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i>

819
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,874
it's already too late.

820
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,100
Then you wait.

821
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,268
You wait.

822
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,963
And whoever speaks first loses.

823
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,216
<i>Sorry, uh...</i>

824
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,797
<i>I appreciate the call.</i>

825
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,237
<i>I really have to give
this some thought</i>

826
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:53,072
<i>and talk to my wife about it.</i>

827
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,265
<i>Can I call you back?</i>

828
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,866
They don't know, right?
They gotta think about it,

829
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,285
they gotta talk to their fucking
wives, or the fucking Tooth Fairy.

830
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,204
Point is, it doesn't matter
what the fuck they say.

831
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:03,791
The only real objection that they have
is that they don't trust you guys.

832
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,501
And why should they trust you?
I mean, look at you.

833
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,422
You're a bunch of fucking
sleazy salesmen, right?

834
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,089
So, what do you say?

835
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,342
You mean to tell me that if I put
you in at Union Carbide at 7

836
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,865
and took you out at 32...

837
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:17,513
Texas Instruments at 11
and took you out at 47...

838
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:20,182
U.S. Steel at 16,
took you out at 41...

839
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,809
You wouldn't be saying
to me right now, "Chester,

840
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,686
"pick me up a few thousand
shares of Disney

841
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,414
"on the spot, right now. Come on."

842
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,314
Honestly, Kevin? Honestly?
Seriously?

843
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,732
<i>I don't know you.</i>

844
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,086
<i>You cold-called me.
You're a total stranger.</i>

845
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,278
I am in complete
agreement with you.

846
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:34,052
You don't know me,
I don't know you.

847
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,281
Let me introduce myself to you.

848
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,740
My name is Alden Kupferberg.

849
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,184
- Robbie Feinberg.
- Chester Ming.

850
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,077
I'm Senior Vice President
at Stratton Oakmont...

851
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,579
and I plan on being one of the...

852
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,956
top brokers in my firm next year.

853
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,997
And I'm not gonna get there
by being wrong, Stanley.

854
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,043
<i>I do wanna say that
you sound like a...</i>

855
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,878
<i>You sound like a
pretty sincere guy.</i>

856
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,046
<i>It's not gonna make you rich</i>

857
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,172
<i>and it's not gonna make you poor.</i>

858
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,742
But what this trade
will do is serve as...

859
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,112
a benchmark
for future business, Kevin.

860
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,013
You feel comfortable
with me now, Scotty?

861
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,347
And then you'll know for sure

862
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,516
that you finally found
a broker on Wall Street

863
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,143
that you can trust,

864
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:07,839
and who can consistently
make you money.

865
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,340
Sound fair enough?

866
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,336
<i>You know what... Yeah.</i>

867
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,964
<i>I gotta say, I'm pretty impressed.</i>

868
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,116
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

869
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,218
Kevin.

870
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,745
You give me one shot here

871
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:25,456
on a blue chip stock like Kodak,

872
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,708
and believe me, Kevin,

873
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:30,336
the only problem you're gonna have

874
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,860
is that you didn't buy more.

875
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,490
Sound fair enough?

876
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,076
<i>Shit. My...</i>

877
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,492
<i>Uh...</i>

878
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,616
<i>My wife might divorce me, but...</i>

879
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:43,833
<i>Yeah, let's do it.</i>

880
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:46,935
Excellent choice, Kevin.

881
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,834
How much do you
want to go for this time?

882
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,898
<i>Let's do 5... $5,000.</i>

883
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,149
Can we try 8,000, Kevin?

884
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,593
<i>All right. Let's do 10.</i>

885
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:54,902
<i>- Ten.
- You want to do that?</i>

886
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:55,986
Excellent choice!

887
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,488
Kevin, let me lock in
that trade right now

888
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,781
and get back to you
in a few minutes

889
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,240
with an exact confirmation, Kevin.

890
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,910
And welcome to Stratton Oakmont.

891
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,184
<i>Thanks, man. I'm gonna have a beer.</i>

892
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,413
<i>This is fun.</i>

893
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,686
Take it easy, Kev.

894
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,692
<i>Hey, thanks, Jordan. Thanks a...</i>

895
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,400
Fuck that motherfucker!

896
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,356
That's what I'm talking about!

897
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,114
What a fucking idiot.

898
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,660
The one thing I know about
in this world is airlines.

899
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:26,118
And Cuchon Airlines
is the future of airlines.

900
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,334
Get in now or...

901
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,103
- I'm Nicky Koskoff...
- Chester Ming...

902
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,396
and I'm a Senior Vice President

903
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:31,714
with Stratton Oakmont.

904
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:35,969
Judy, I am so, so, so
sorry for your loss.

905
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,486
When did he pass?

906
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:38,570
Just say I'm wrong, right.

907
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,697
And the stock goes down
a couple points...

908
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,281
and it makes you,
in the words of my grandfather,

909
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,159
God rest his soul,
"A shit ton of money."

910
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,369
It's like getting in
on fucking sunlight

911
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,017
before there was fucking sunlight.
You understand?

912
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,914
<i>Can we do 8,000 shares?</i>

913
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,483
<i>Okay, 25,000.</i>

914
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,585
That's a very intelligent decision.

915
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,346
I'm gonna transfer you
to my sales associate.

916
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,232
Rhonda!

917
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,258
- Rhonda!
- ...put you through to Andrea.

918
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:01,077
Has anybody fucking seen Rhonda?

919
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:08,809
<i>Everybody have a good week?</i>

920
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,002
Yeah!

921
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,479
<i>The end of the month.</i>

922
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,150
<i>$28.7 million in gross commissions,</i>

923
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,970
<i>all from pink sheet stock, boys!</i>

924
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,699
<i>And to celebrate with our
weekly act of debauchery,</i>

925
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,534
<i>I have offered our
lovely sales assistant,</i>

926
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,536
<i>Danielle Harrison, here,</i>

927
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:31,331
<i>$10,000 to shave her fucking head!</i>

928
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,558
Yeah!

929
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,112
Yeah, you want this?

930
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:37,272
You want this?

931
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,782
<i>Let's scalp her! Scalp her!</i>

932
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,176
Let the scalping begin!

933
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,290
Scalp! Scalp! Scalp!

934
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:51,435
<i>FYI, boys, Danielle has promised</i>

935
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,480
<i>to use this $10,000
for breast implants!</i>

936
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,898
<i>She's already got C cups,</i>

937
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,001
<i>but now she wants
fucking double D's!</i>

938
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,716
<i>Is this a great fucking
company or what?</i>

939
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:06,051
<i>Is this the greatest company
in the world?</i>

940
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,475
<i>Donnie!</i>

941
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,983
<i>Blow the roof off
this motherfucker!</i>

942
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,259
- Champagne?
- Whoo!

943
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,640
<i>Send in the stripees!</i>

944
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,047
Mine!

945
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,756
<i>Word about us
spread throughout Wall Street.</i>

946
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,734
<i>Even the places I
didn't want it to.</i>

947
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,812
<i>It wasn't long before
Forbes magazine,</i>

948

Let me ask you, how do you see
the future for Stratton Oakmont?

950
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,341
One word?

951
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,137
Diversification.

952
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,200
Sounds good. Thank you so much.
I have more than enough.

953
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,285
- I appreciate your time.
- Fantastic.

954
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:14,387
Can we get a quick picture?

00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,934

Look at this!</i>

Your hair looks good.

There is no such thing as

Mr. Belfort!
Can you look at my resume, please?

Excuse me, excuse me, sir!

971

Calm the fuck down!

972

What the hell's all this?

973
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:00,024
It's the Forbes article.
They all want to work for you now.

974

Hey! What did I say?

00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,526
I'm just trying to be nice.

Hey, you want a job,
you talk to me!

977
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:06,814
- Mr. Belfort!
- Give me one minute.

978
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,530
Forbes made me a superstar.

<i>Every day, dozens of money-crazed
kids beat a path to my door.</i>

980

<i>If we hired 'em, they dropped
straight out of college overnight</i>

981
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,269
<i>and spent whatever
allowance they had</i>

982
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,772
<i>on a new suit from
our Stratton tailor.</i>

983

Are you fucking serious right now?

00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:29,592
<i>I mean, we were literally putting
clothes on these kids' backs.</i>

<i>And here comes this jerk-off
sniffing around.</i>

986

<i>But, you know, every time

<i>Within months, we doubled in size,</i>

<i>moved to even bigger offices.</i>

990
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,403
<i>It was a madhouse.</i>

991
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,033
<i>A greed-fest,</i>

992
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:59,034
<i>with equal parts cocaine,
testosterone, and body fluids.</i>

993
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:00,618
Yes!

994
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:05,230
<i>It got so bad, I had to declare
the office a fuck-free zone</i>

<i>between the hours of 9:00 and 7:00.</i>

996
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,943
<i>But I'm telling you,
even that didn't help.</i>

997
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:13,113
<i>Actually, the madness started
on our very first day,</i>

998
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,656
<i>when one of our
brokers, Ben Jenner,</i>

999
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,867
<i>christened the elevator
by getting a blowjob</i>

1000
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,452
<i>from a sales assistant.</i>

1001
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,454
<i>Her name was Pam,
and to her credit,</i>

1002
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,789
<i>she did have this
amazing technique,</i>

1003
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,564
<i>with this wild twist
and jerk motion.</i>

1004
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,085
<i>About a month later,</i>

1005
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,087
<i>Donnie and I decided
to double-team her</i>

1006

<i>on a Saturday afternoon</i>

1007
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,192
<i>while our wives were out shopping
for Christmas dresses.</i>

1008
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:34,843
<i>Eventually, Ben married her,</i>

1009
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:37,387
<i>which was pretty amazing
considering she blew</i>

1010
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,786
<i>every single guy in the office.</i>

1011
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:43,127
<i>Then he got depressed and killed
himself three years later.</i>

1012
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:47,647
<i>Anyway, I hired my dad, Max,

<i>Stratton's very own Gestapo.</i>

<i>We called him Mad Max
because of his hair-trigger temper,</i>

1015
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,739
<i>which could be set off by something</i>

1016
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,741
<i>as innocuous as a
ringing telephone.</i>

1017
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,079
Who the fuck has the goddamn gall

1018
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,808
to call this house
on a Tuesday night?

1019
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,042
God damn it!

1020
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,168
You're gonna miss it!

1021
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:10,087
Ooh, please, tell me
something I don't know.

1022
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,923
I wait all week for
the fucking <i>Equalizer</i>

1023
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,300
and they have to fucking... Hello.

1024
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,094
<i>But as soon as
he picked up the phone...</i>

1025
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,492
Gene. How are you, Gene?

1026
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,514
<i>he'd affect this weird
British accent.</i>

1027
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,367
Right-o, Gene, that'd be great.

1028
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,101
Cheerio.

1029
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,185
<i>It was absolutely bizarre.</i>

1030
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,853
The fucking halfwit!

1031
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:27,979
<i>- He'd hang up...</i>
- You missed it!

1032
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,003
<i>and then he's Mad
Max all over again.</i>

1033
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:31,459
Damn it!

1034
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,382
All right, tell me what happened.
What happened?

1035
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,946
Well, he discovered it
was the mother's sister.

1036
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,447
Who's he? Who? Tell me who...

1037
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,116
The main guy.
You know who the main...

1038
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,283
The main guy...

1039
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,728
it was his mother's sister.
She showed up dead.

1040
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,705
<i>Of course, Mad
Max didn't have to know</i>

1041
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,524
<i>everything we were
doing at Stratton.</i>

1042
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,648
And then there's a
big target and we...

1043
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,650
They get launched at the target.
They stick.

1044
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,880
<i>There's a bull's-eye
and the bull's-eye's a dollar sign.</i>

1045
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,048
<i>Whoever gets closer
to the dollar sign...</i>

1046
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,091
gets the most points.

1047
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,385
I'm gonna throw the shit out
of this little fucking thing.

1048
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,387
So if it gets hurt, what happens?

1049
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,721
'Cause we're gonna
get fucking nuts.

1050
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,056
I don't think he's gonna get hurt.
They're like...

1051
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,933
They got like superhuman strength.

1052
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,226
I think he's gonna be fine.

1053
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,228
You can't look him
right in the eyes.

1054
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:09,479
You can't look him in the eye?

1055
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,253
That's a fact. I saw it on PBS.

1056
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,191
They get confused
and their wires get crossed.

1057
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,818
You gotta look at their chin.

1058
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:15,944
Like it looks like
I'm looking at you

1059
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,028
but I'm looking at your chin.

1060
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,239
I feel like you're addressing me
right now, but you're not, are you?

1061
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,241
They're like <i>the Mona Lisa.</i>
They find eye contact,

1062
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:22,889
like, wherever you are
standing in the room.

1063
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:24,178
And they lock in.

1064
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:26,687
No, but there is a limit
to what we can do with them?

1065
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:28,081
We're allowed to throw shit at 'em.

1066
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,583
We're allowed to
throw food? Bananas.

1067
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,084
Any food. Correct.

1068
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,252
But, for example,
what I wouldn't do is

1069
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,087
maybe like tell him
to pull his cock out

1070
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,861
and like get some of the girls to,
you know,

1071
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,048
fondle him and shit like that.

1072
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,133
That would be...
That's unacceptable?

1073
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:39,217
Let's keep that in our back pocket.

1074
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,303
This guy is more about
throwing at the dartboard.

1075
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:42,405
Correct. Yes, yes, yes.

1076
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,847
The thing is, this
is their gift, okay.

1077
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,974
They're built to be thrown
like a lawn dart.

1078
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,267
They're top heavy like a lawn dart.

1079
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:48,351
So they're built for accuracy.

1080
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,375
Oh, my God. Can we
bowl with this guy?

1081
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:51,563
That's his fucking brother, Rob.

1082
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:52,981
His brother's the bowling ball.

1083
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,774
The brother,
you put a skateboard on him,

1084
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,109
you strap him to a skateboard,

1085
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,611
you toss him down an
alley at some pins.

1086
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,321
- No shit. That's interesting.
- Swear to fucking God.

1087
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,406
- Can we get that guy?
- Yeah, we'll get that guy, too.

1088
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,575
But it says here this guy
will show his cock. Yeah.

1089
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:04,910
- Instead of growing up. Yeah.
- He will?

1090
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:06,286
They are very ornery by the way,

1091
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:07,787
so you gotta be very careful
with these little guys.

1092
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:08,872
Safety first.

1093
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,040
Safety is first, all right?

1094
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,958
I want somebody with
a fucking tranquilizer gun

1095
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,710
ready to knock this fucker out.

1096
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,962
- Do we want to get like a...
- Mace. Taser guns.

1097
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,047
A pellet gun maybe?

1098
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,256
No, a pellet gun is gonna hurt him.

1099
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,737
I just want him out.
Knocked out cold.

1100
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:22,362
But I say we stick with
the loophole. Right? Okay?

1101
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,304
If we don't consider him a human,

1102
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,556
we just consider it an act,
I think we're in the clear.

1103
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,682
Like The Flying Wallendas.

1104
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,726
You know, a lot of those guys died
but they never sued anybody.

1105
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,561
The important thing
you guys gotta keep in mind

1106
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,505
is that these things gossip.

1107
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,148
They get together and they gossip.

1108
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,650
- That's a good point.
- And the last thing

1109
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,902
that we need is them
getting together and saying,

1110
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,570
"Oh, they made fun of us."

1111
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,239
Like, it's gonna make
Stratton look bad.

1112
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,407
That's why I love you.
You think of shit like that.

1113
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,512
When they come in, we treat
it just like one of us. Okay?

1114
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:50,891
One of us.
Gooble gobble, one of us.

1115
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,562
We accept them, one of us!

1116
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:54,352
Gooble gobble, one of us.

1117
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:55,752
We accept them, one of us.

1118
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:56,878
Gooble gobble, one of us!

1119
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,255
Jordan! Your dad's coming.

1120
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,824
Something about the
American Express bill.

1121
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,074
Can you get him out of here?

1122
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,284
Yeah. Lick my twat.

1123
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,615
No, I'm serious!

1124
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,054
Fuck. Guys, act like we're working.

1125
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:07,623
You got any fucking stock forms?

1126
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,224
He's coming, he's coming.

1127
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:10,451
Make some shit up.

1128
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,582
I think if we short Pfizer...

1129
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:17,588
$430,000 in one month, Jordy, huh?

1130
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:22,988
Four hundred and fucking 30,000
fucking dollars in one fucking month!

1131
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:25,198
Good morning.
They're business expenses. Relax.

1132
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,533
- Business expenses?
- Yes.

1133
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,034
- Jordy, look what you got here.
- What?

1134
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:31,981
Look at this. $26,000
for one fucking dinner!

1135
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,812
Okay. No, no.
This could be explained.

1136
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,319
Dad, we had clients.
The Pfizer clients.

1137
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,253
Right. The porterhouse
from Argentina.

1138
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:40,547
Expensive champagne and...
We had to buy champagne.

1139
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:42,150
And you ordered all
the fucking sides.

1140
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:44,217
- Tell him about the sides.
- I ordered sides, so...

1141
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:47,788
Sides? $26,000 worth of sides?

1142
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:50,165
What are these sides?
They cure cancer?

1143
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,142
The sides did cure cancer.
That's the problem.

1144
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:53,665
That's why they were expensive.

1145
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,671
- Shut the fuck up.
- I'm serious.

1146
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,731
- Stop.
- And EJ Entertainment?

1147
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,505
What the fuck is EJ Entertainment?

1148
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,402
Well, that's, uh...

1149
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:03,611
Yeah, Jordy,
what's EJ Entertainment?

1150
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:04,738
How do I describe this?

1151
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:05,864
Jord, what is that?

1152
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:08,059
- It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy!
- I know.

1153
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,177
- That's what it is!
- That is what it is.

1154
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,287
Isn't that the perfect
description for it?

1155
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:14,956
That is what it is. But none
of these were charged to me.

1156
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,354
This is all of them.

1157
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,251
- Oh, that was all us?
- It wasn't me though.

1158
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,195
Fucking explain this shit to him!

1159
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,732
These are all of your
fucking charges right here!

1160
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,425
The IRS, they allow
for T&A. It's fine.

1161
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:26,718
T&E!

1162
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,866
T&E!

1163
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,012
Yeah. I said T&E.

1164
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:30,388
- No, no. You said T&A.
- No, I didn't.

1165
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,473
Yeah, you did.

1166
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:33,850
- When did I say that?
- You said T&A. It's T&E.

1167
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,226
I know you're upset
about the dinner,

1168
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:39,606
and that makes sense because we did
spend too much money. But I said T&E.

1169
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:41,316
Don't tell me what you said.
I heard what you said.

1170
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:42,692
- Dad. He said T&A.
- He did?

1171
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,110
Absolutely, no question.

1172
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,362
I'm trying to...

1173
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:46,488
I'm getting this close!

1174
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:47,781
- Dad, relax.
- I'm getting this close.

1175
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,325
That's what I'm saying.
I want you to open up more, Max.

1176
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:51,451
He's gonna fucking kill you.

1177
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,099
Why do you hold it in?
Why do you...

1178
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,871
Max, why do you hold it in?

1179
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,690
That's it. Get the
fuck out of here!

1180
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,105
- No, no, no!
- Asshole, get out of here.

1181
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,233
What kind of hooker
takes credit cards?

1182
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,379
A rich one.

1183
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,798
<i>At Stratton,
there were three kinds of hookers.</i>

1184
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:07,175
<i>The Blue Chips, top of the line,
model material.</i>

1185
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:08,760
<i>They cost between $300 and $500</i>

1186
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,136
<i>and you had to wear a condom</i>

1187
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,638
<i>unless you gave them a hefty tip,</i>

1188
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,582
<i>which, of course, I always did.</i>

1189
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:17,310
<i>Then came the NASDAQs,
who were pretty, not great.</i>

1190
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,729
<i>They cost between
200 and 300 bucks.</i>

1191
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,299
<i>Finally, there were the
Pink Sheets. Skanks.</i>

1192
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:25,276
<i>They cost about 100 or less.
If you didn't wear a condom,</i>

1193
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,611
<i>you'd have to get a penicillin shot</i>

1194
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:29,072
<i>the next day
and pray your dick didn't fall off.</i>

1195
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,016
<i>Not that we didn't fuck them, too.</i>

1196
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,927
<i>Believe me, we did.</i>

1197
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,767
Ow! It's that slipped
disc thing again.

1198
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,315
I know what it is.
You know, too much...

1199
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,125
with EJ Entertainment.

1200
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:41,209
Pops.

1201
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,653
How are things at home?

1202
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,313
Well, not the best.

1203
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,941
She just doesn't...
You know what I'm saying?

1204
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,508
It's like the smell...

1205
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,202
There's a smell,
there's an attraction thing.

1206
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,846
After a while it kind of fades away
a little bit.

1207
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:54,597
Yeah, well. It's
supposed to fade away.

1208
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,621
- Supposed to?
- That's marriage. You know...

1209
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,336
Your mother and I, we've been
married a long, long time.

1210
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,562
What do you think? We're, we're...

1211
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,506
We're jumping into bed
every two minutes?

1212
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:03,966
- It doesn't work that way.
- I love her to death.

1213
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:06,210
I want to stay married, Dad, but...

1214
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:07,610
It's crazy out there.

1215
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,195
Some of these girls...
You should see them.

1216
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,548
Oh, my God!

1217
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,198
They're fucking...

1218
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,200
The things they're doing now, Pops.

1219
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,645
I mean... I mean, it's
on a whole other level.

1220
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,309
- Really?
- And they're all shaved, too.

1221
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,852
- Get out of here!
- All shaven.

1222
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,312
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.

1223
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,652
- Bald as a china doll.
- No bush?

1224
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,734
- No bush.
- Oh, my God!

1225
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:29,424
All of a sudden, one week, nobody
had anything down there anymore.

1226
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:30,508
It's a new world.

1227
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,552
They're bald from
the eyebrows down.

1228
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:35,156
- Wow.
- Nothing. Not a stitch. It's like lasers.

1229
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:36,581
Wow. A new world.

1230
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,702
I was born too... Too early.

1231
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,004
I've never been a fan of the bush,
to be honest.

1232
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,396
- Really?
- Yeah.

1233
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,589
I don't mind it.

1234
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:45,958
Dad.

1235
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,502
I don't want you stressing out
about any of this.

1236
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:49,861
How can I not get stressed out?

1237
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:51,321
Look at the knuckleheads
you got working for you.

1238
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,572
I know they're knuckleheads

1239
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,926
but I need them to want to
live like me, you get it?

1240
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,343
To live like me.

1241
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,807
Jordy.

1242
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:01,649
One of these days, the chickens are
gonna come home to roost.

1243
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:05,478
You're looking at
me like I'm crazy.

1244
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:08,948
Crazy? This is obscene.

1245
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:10,525
<i>It was obscene.</i>

1246
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,280
<i>In the normal world.</i>

1247
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,783
<i>But who the fuck
wanted to live there?</i>

1248
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:18,620
<i>Go party your fucking cocks off!</i>

1249
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:25,544
<i>We are about to
become fucking legends</i>

1250
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:27,549
<i>on Wall Street!</i>

1251
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:32,111
<i>We got plans up here
that's gonna take this company</i>

1252
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:35,182
<i>into the fucking stratosphere!</i>

1253
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,887
Wolfie! Wolfie!

1254
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,734
Fuck Merrill Lynch. Fuck them.

1255
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:48,294
Why should they be taking all our
fucking money all the fucking time?

1256
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,587
This way we become
the underwriters.

1257
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,214
<i>It was our next big move.</i>

1258
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:54,884
<i>Finding companies to
take public. IPOs.</i>

1259
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,761
<i>It was the only way
these Wall Street pricks</i>

1260
00:50:56,762 --> 00:51:00,557
<i>would ever stop thinking of us
as some shitkicker bucket shop.</i>

1261
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:01,875
We got Arncliffe International.

1262
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:03,476
<i>See, we were a little different.</i>

1263
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:07,146
<i>We liked to get as fucked up as
possible during our business powwows</i>

1264
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,691
<i>in order to stimulate
our free-flowing ideas,</i>

1265
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:12,796
<i>which is why we were popping
these ludes like they were M&M's.</i>

1266
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:14,926
Steve Madden.

1267
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:17,615
We own the fucking companies...

1268
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,492
We own the companies...

1269
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,516
<i>Don't know what
a lude is? I'll tell you.</i>

1270
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,602
<i>Oh. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

1271
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:28,440
<i>Looks like those ludes are working
their magic on Donnie right now.</i>

1272
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,244
The Quaalude,

1273
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:06,205
<i>or lude, as it is
commonly referred to,</i>

1274
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,833
<i>was first synthesized in 1951</i>

1275
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,586
<i>by an Indian doctor,
that's dots, not feathers,</i>

1276
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:13,087
<i>as a sedative,</i>

1277
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:17,034
<i>and was prescribed to stressed-out
housewives with sleep disorders.</i>

1278
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,886
<i>But pretty soon someone figured out</i>

1279
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:23,723
<i>that if you resisted the urge
to sleep for just 15 minutes,</i>

1280
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:26,202
<i>you got a pretty
kick-ass high from it.</i>

1281
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:30,172
<i>Didn't take long for people to
start abusing ludes, of course.</i>

1282
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,463
<i>And in 1982, the U-S.
government Schedule 1'd them.</i>

1283
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,669
<i>Along with the rest of the world.</i>

1284
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:39,098
<i>Which meant there was only a finite
amount of these things left.</i>

1285
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:42,134
<i>No shit,
you can't even buy 'em anymore.</i>

1286
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,682
<i>You people are all
shit out of luck.</i>

1287
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,287
What are you saying? What is it?

1288
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,560
Steve Madden.

1289
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,558
Steve Madden.

1290
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:50,934
Steve.

1291
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,185
Steve.

1292
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:53,920
<i>You remember those ads?</i>

1293
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:56,381
<i>Those giant-headed girls
with the bug eyes</i>

1294
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:58,109
<i>wearing those big clunky shoes?</i>

1295
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,385
My friend from school,
Steve Madden.

1296
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:01,844
His friend from
school, Steve Madden.

1297
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,722
<i>Steve Madden was the name in
women's shoes at the moment.</i>

1298
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:08,518
<i>And all of Wall Street was
begging to take his company public.</i>

1299
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:09,852
Go ahead, go ahead, what is it?

1300
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,229
<i>Except, guess who grew up with him?</i>

1301
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,106
- Women's shoes.
- Women's shoes.

1302
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:15,756
<i>My very own Vice President.</i>

1303
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,652
Women's shoes!

1304
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:19,551
<i>Diamond Donnie Azoff.</i>

1305
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,240
- Steve Madden.
- Steve.

1306
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:23,658
Steve.

1307
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:24,784
Hey, JB, JB, JB, JB.

1308
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:26,057
You gotta come check
this fucking chick out.

1309
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:27,930
Look at this. Look.

1310
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,878
I would fuck that girl
if she was my sister.

1311
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,402
I would let that girl
give me fucking AIDS.

1312
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:40,739
You want to see
the Wolf handle this?

1313
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:44,697
She's hot.

1314
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,535
Cristy.

1315
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,505
Jordan, this is my friend Naomi.

1316
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:56,149
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Naomi.

1317
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,752
Naomi, nice to meet you.

1318
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,636
You got an awesome place here.

1319
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,988
I've don't think I've ever been
in a house this big before.

1320
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:03,261
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1321
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,591
Beautiful beach out there.

1322
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,842
Blair Hollingsworth.

1323
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,102
Hi, Blair. Nice to meet you.

1324
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:09,855
- Your name's Blair, right?
- Yeah.

1325
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,230
You like to Jet Ski?

1326
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:12,874
I've never done it before.

1327
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:13,958
You've never
Jet Ski'd in your life?

1328
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,001
No, I've never Jet Ski'd.

1329
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,544
You've never been on a Jet Ski?

1330
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:17,795
How many times are
you gonna ask her?

1331
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,273
She's never been on a Jet Ski.

1332
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,946
I don't know.
Might ask her a couple more times.

1333
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,620
Okay. Sure.

1334
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:27,555
Hi. I'm Hildy. Nice to meet you.

1335
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,624
- Hi.
- Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

1336
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,119
Yeah, I'll be out in
a couple of minutes.

1337
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:32,518
Just tell her I'll be out
in a couple of minutes.

1338
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,061
Why don't you tell your wife that?

1339
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,146
I might do that, but I'm having

1340
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,647
- a conversation right now.
- What am I, your secretary?

1341
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,691
You know what,
I think we should get going.

1342
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,013
Wait, wait. Where you guys going?

1343
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,549
We gotta go.
We got two other parties to go to.

1344
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,305
- We can stay for a drink.
- Yeah, stay for a drink.

1345
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,678
No. We got two other parties
we're supposed to get to.

1346
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:46,866
But we can stay for a drink...

1347
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:48,184
She's

1348
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,012
perfect.

1349
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:51,621
- You like champagne?
- I do.

1350
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:52,705
She's perfect.

1351
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:54,207
Donnie, what the
fuck are you doing?

1352
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,981
You piece of...

1353
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,320
You're gonna have to excuse my friend.
He gets...

1354
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:07,720
Get the fuck out!

1355
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,522
Jordan, you gotta fuck her, bro.
She's so hot!

1356
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:10,991
Yeah, Donnie!

1357
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,143
Let him fucking finish, Hildy.

1358
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,871
That's fucking rude.

1359
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,793
Have some fucking manners.

1360
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,758
So, Bay Ridge,
that's near Staten Island, right?

1361
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:26,177
Brooklyn, across the
Verrazano Bridge.

1362
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,845
<i>Saturday Night Fever</i> territory.

1363
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,468
That's right. Guinea Gulch.

1364
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,828
We call the Verrazano Bridge
the Guinea Gangplank.

1365
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:32,995
Right.

1366
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,723
So I presume you're Italian?

1367
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:35,998
On my dad's side.

1368
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,319
I'm also Dutch, German, English.

1369
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:40,900
I'm a mutt.

1370
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,405
Yeah. You're a mutt.

1371
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,820
Yeah, I still have family
over there though, in London.

1372
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:47,593
My Aunt Emma. She's the best.

1373
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,638
Very British, you know.
She's a classy lady.

1374
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:52,056
That explains it then.

1375
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,140
Explains what?

1376
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:56,040
It explains you.
I mean, you're a duchess, right?

1377
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:58,209
The Duchess of Bay Ridge.

1378
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,650
Excuse me.

1379
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:04,719
Could I get a straw, please?

1380
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:07,389
Thank you.

1381
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:13,228
So I was, um, a little surprised

1382
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:15,643
you asked Cristy for my number.

1383
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:17,975
Why is that?

1384
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,694
Aren't you married?

1385
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:25,214
Well... Yeah, but what?

1386
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,238
Married people can't have friends?

1387
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,079
We're gonna be friends?

1388
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:35,243
Yeah. You don't want
to be my friend?

1389
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:41,336
We're not gonna be friends.

1390
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:52,267
And at night I work on my designs.

1391
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:55,036
I have an entire line of lingerie.

1392
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:58,016
You know, camisoles,
bustiers, panties.

1393
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,417
<i>She designs women's panties, too?</i>

1394
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,236
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1395
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:16,200
<i>Come on, Jordan, think of a way
to get up to her apartment.</i>

1396
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,791
You wanna come up for
some tea or something?

1397
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:26,752
Tea? Yeah.

1398
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:28,736
- Like hot tea?
- Yeah.

1399
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,134
Oh, yeah. That sounds nice. Yeah.

1400
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:32,516
<i>Tea. Fuck, yeah,
I wanted to come up for tea.</i>

1401
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,660
Like Darjeeling or rose hip,
something nice like that?

1402
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:36,702
Sure.

1403
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:37,975
This is Rocky.

1404
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,482
Oh, who's this? Say hi, Rocky.

1405
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:41,941
Hi, sweetheart.

1406
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,147
Okay.

1407
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,313
Why don't you light a fire or
something and I'll be right out.

1408
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,736
- Yeah. Fire, here?
- Sure.

1409
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,699
I like your painting here.
It's, uh...

1410
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:03,456
<i>God, help me.
How do I fuck this girl?</i>

1411
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,067
You all right?

1412
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:10,512
Yeah, yeah.
Just trying to light the fire here.

1413
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,702
<i>That's it. That's it,
you're leaving.</i>

1414
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:19,680
<i>Don't get involved.
Go home to your wife.</i>

1415
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:31,424
<i>As you can probably guess,</i>

1416
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:34,119
<i>I fucked her goddamn brains out...</i>

1417
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,928
Jesus Lord!

1418
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:40,409
<i>For 11 seconds.</i>

1419
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:52,800
Did you just come?

1420
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:54,844
Oh, yeah, I just came.

1421
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,225
Did you? Did you come?

1422
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,951
- No.
- No?

1423
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,178
Okay.

1424
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,397
I'm still hard so
just give me a sec.

1425
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,895
Sure.

1426
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,852
Come on, baby, come on.

1427
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,573
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1428
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,822
Oh, God!

1429
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,824
Fuck off, Rocky! Bad dog.

1430
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,141
You have a biscuit
or something like that?

1431
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:23,243
It's okay.

1432
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:25,019
- Just keep going.
- Rocky, go play.

1433
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,997
Go play, Rocky. Go, go, go, go.

1434
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:30,816
You're crazy.

1435
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,151
<i>I couldn't get enough.</i>

1436
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:34,612
<i>I mean, her pussy was
like heroin to me.</i>

1437
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:37,448
<i>And it wasn't just
about the sex, either.</i>

1438
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:39,492
<i>Naomi and I got along.
I mean, we...</i>

1439
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:41,470
<i>We had similar interests and shit.</i>

1440
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,435
Ooh. Choo-choo train.

1441
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:49,819
Yeah.

1442
00:59:56,885 --> 01:00:00,706
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.

1443
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:10,003
Yeah, yeah.
Let's toke it all on there, huh?

1444
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:11,732
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1445
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,210
Oh, shit!

1446
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:24,954
You!

1447
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:27,081
Get out of the fucking car!

1448
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:28,499
Jesus Christ.

1449
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,149
Son of a bitch! Oh, fuck!

1450
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,280
Relax, sweetheart. Relax.

1451
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:37,049
- Son of a fucking bitch!
- Okay, okay... Geez!

1452
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,493
Okay, babe, stop!

1453
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,783
- Please.
- Bitch!

1454
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,180
- What are you doing...
- That whore from the party?

1455
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,765
Jesus Christ!

1456
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:45,891
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1457
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,268
I thought you were at
the fucking beach!

1458
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:48,712
I didn't know you were here!

1459
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:50,312
That's where you've fucking been?

1460
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,064
With that fucking
whore from the party?

1461
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,607
I thought you were
at the beach house.

1462
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,067
How could you do this to me?

1463
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,903
- Sweetie, come on...
- Who the fuck are you, Jordan?

1464
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,781
You're like a completely
different fucking person!

1465
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:04,011
I made a mistake. I don't know
what to tell you, babe. I...

1466
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:05,683
I'm sorry.

1467
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:08,390
- I'm sorry.
- Is that who... Is that what you want?

1468
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:20,194
Do you love her?

1469
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,367
Answer me.

1470
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:51,020
<i>I felt horrible.</i>

1471
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,792
<i>Three days later,
I filed for a divorce</i>

1472
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:55,895
<i>and moved Naomi into the apartment.</i>

1473
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:01,383
<i>Say what you will,</i>

1474
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,636
<i>but the Duchess did have style.</i>

1475
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:06,889
<i>She brought in a decorator,
feng shui'd the whole place.</i>

1476
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,016
<i>She even hired a gay butler.</i>

1477
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:11,977
<i>This guy was smart,</i>
<i>sophisticated, professional</i>

1478
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,705
<i>Really, really great.</i>

1479
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:15,127
Is that jasmine?

1480
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,126
Yes, sir. I tried to stump you
this evening. Very good.

1481
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:20,069
Very good. Great nose.

1482
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,843
<i>Except for that one time.</i>

1483
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,261
Oh, my God!

1484
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,439
Oh, hey.

1485
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:33,233
Is it Wednesday already?

1486
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:35,501
- Uh...
- Oh, don't stop.

1487
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:36,694
What the fuck!

1488
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,780
That is fucked up!

1489
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,464
He must have thought we were still

1490
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:42,132
at the Hamptons this weekend,
you know.

1491
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:43,592
Where were they doing it,
sweetheart? In the bedroom?

1492
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,345
They were everywhere. There were
two guys over there on the table.

1493
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:47,680
There were more over here.

1494
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:49,223
- There were four right here.
- Ugh!

1495
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:50,975
Are you fucking serious?
Right there?

1496
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:53,852
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Oh, baby, it gets worse.

1497
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,962
After they left,
I checked the apartment.

1498
01:02:57,983 --> 01:02:59,130
Right. What?

1499
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,336
What is it, babe? What?

1500
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:02,736
<i>Where's my money?</i>

1501
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:03,821
I don't know where your money...

1502
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:05,906
Where is my fucking money?
Where is it?

1503
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,950
I don't know where your money is,
Mr. Belfort.

1504
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,286
- I didn't do anything.
- If you don't get...

1505
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,662
He's lying through
his fucking teeth.

1506
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:12,913
Let's start from the beginning.

1507
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,206
Let's start from the
beginning, all right?

1508
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,900
You invited some
friends over, right?

1509
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,835
One thing led to another.
Things got out of hand.

1510
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:19,378
We understand that, we do.

1511
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:21,922
We do blow all the time. We're
fucking degenerates ourselves.

1512
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,090
Look at us, right?

1513
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:24,758
But money was stolen
from my apartment.

1514
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,385
Right from my sock drawer.
All right?

1515
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:28,595
Like I said,
I don't know where your money is.

1516
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:30,055
Just start from the beginning.
Who came over?

1517
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,181
It was just a normal day.

1518
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,558
I knew you were coming home
the next day.

1519
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,935
So everything would be fine.
It'd be cleaned up.

1520
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:36,895
I got a little high at breakfast.

1521
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,814
So I got a little happy.
I had some eggs,

1522
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:39,898
I had a little bit of ice cream.

1523
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,817
And then I said, "Who do I
know that likes ice cream?"

1524
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,360
It's my friend, Rudy.
So I called Rudy.

1525
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,930
- Who's Rudy?
- Yeah, who's Rudy?

1526
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:50,743
- You know who Rudy is. Come on.
- Me? I don't...

1527
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:51,994
- You know...
- Who the fuck is Rudy?

1528
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:53,120
I don't know anyone named Rudy.

1529
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:54,246
Last month. The Lollipop Club.

1530
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,831
You know who Rudy was. Dancing...

1531
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,980
You know who Rudy is?

1532
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,419
I don't fucking know any...

1533
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,462
What do you mean?

1534
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:02,629
So he went to The Lollipop Club?

1535
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,298
Oh, he was
at The Lollipop Club for sure.

1536
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:05,924
On the stage, grinding
with everybody.

1537
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,572
I got fucked up. I like to dance.

1538
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,595
I don't know.
Maybe I met him, maybe I didn't.

1539
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:11,323
I meet a lot of fucking people.

1540
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,098
- What are you saying?
- $50,000 was stolen

1541
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,433
from my fucking sock drawer!

1542
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,018
All my girlfriend's
jewelry is gone.

1543
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:18,020
- Where the fuck is it?
- ...Rudy. What the fuck?

1544
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:20,147
Did your fucking little faggot
friend Rudy take my shit?

1545
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:21,921
Did he? Answer me!

1546
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,506
Okay. Now I get it.
Now I get why I'm...

1547
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:25,758
- This is a gay thing.
- Oh!

1548
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:27,696
See, all of you...

1549
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,217
You think this is
'cause you're a fag?

1550
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,200
My cousin's a fucking faggot.

1551
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,619
And I go on vacation with him
and his boyfriend. I love fags.

1552
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:34,870
You were in charge, right?

1553
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,622
I will not be stolen from.
You get that?

1554
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:38,916
I fucking like gay people.
I don't like you.

1555
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:40,292
He should've hired
a fucking Mexican

1556
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:41,645
like I have in my fucking house.

1557
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,864
Shit! What the fuck...

1558
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,427
Talk, you fuck, talk!

1559
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:51,637
I'm gonna drop you, you faggot!

1560
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,055
Where is it?

1561
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:56,100
<i>Chester and Toby,
they went all yakuza on Nicholas.</i>

1562
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:57,267
<i>You know, they got crazy.</i>

1563
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:58,415
I don't know!

1564
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:02,127
<i>I had to call the cops just to
keep them from killing the poor guy.</i>

1565
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,649
<i>I gave them each 1,000 bucks</i>

1566
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,844
<i>and told them what
Nicholas had done.</i>

1567
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:07,504
<i>Then they kicked his ass.</i>

1568
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:09,343
Thanks again, Officer.

1569
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:12,324
<i>It's not like I cared about
the 50 grand anyway.</i>

1570
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:13,992
<i>I was making that much
almost every day</i>

1571
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:16,370
<i>through one rathole or another.</i>

1572
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:19,206
<i>Now a rathole is a
friend, like Brad here,</i>

1573
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:21,834
<i>who held stock in his name for me.</i>

1574
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:24,169
Who are you supposed to be, huh?
Jack Nickle-Jew?

1575
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,797
<i>I'd drive the price up
then he'd sell</i>

1576
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:29,007
<i>and kick most of the
profits back to...</i>

1577
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:30,985
<i>You guessed it, me.</i>

1578
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:36,265
<i>All cash. None of
it's on the books.</i>

1579
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:38,619
<i>A big no-no, of course,
in the eyes of the law.</i>

1580
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,672
<i>Enter our new securities attorney,
Manny Riskin.</i>

1581
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:46,400
<i>700 bucks an hour
to be the voice of doom.</i>

1582
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,193
Listen to me.
You piss up the SEC's leg,

1583
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:49,528
you end up with your
tits in a ringer.

1584
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:52,633
Do not worry about it.
I have the SEC under control.

1585
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:55,476
What the fuck
are these imbeciles doing?

1586
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:56,910
Hey! Hey!

1587
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:58,370
What are you doing? Hey!

1588
01:05:58,371 --> 01:05:59,814
We got the SEC in here.

1589
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,499
<i>The Securities
and Exchange Commission</i>

1590
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,169
<i>sent two lawyers down
to review our files.</i>

1591
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:07,171
<i>So I set them up in
our conference room</i>

1592
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:08,338
<i>and I had it bugged</i>

1593
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:10,632
<i>and the air conditioning
turned up so high</i>

1594
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,217
<i>that it felt like
Antarctica in there.</i>

1595
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,303
Is it always this cold in here?

1596
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:15,387
I don't know.

1597
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:16,680
<i>Then, while they were looking</i>

1598
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,182
<i>for a smoking gun in that room...</i>

1599
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:20,081
Arncliffe International is on fire.

1600
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:23,395
<i>I was gonna fire off
a bazooka in here,</i>

1601
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:25,731
<i>offering up our latest IPO.</i>

1602
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:28,317
An IPO is an initial
public offering.

1603
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:32,154
It's the first time a stock is offered
for sale to the general population.

1604
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:34,072
Now, as the firm taking
the company public,

1605
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,866
we set the initial sales price

1606
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:38,686
then sold those shares
right back to our friends. The...

1607
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,412
Look.

1608
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,390
I know you're not following
what I'm saying anyway, right?

1609
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:44,416
That's okay. That doesn't matter.

1610
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,335
The real question is this.

1611
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:48,295
"Was all this legal?"

1612
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:50,273
Absolutely fucking not.

1613
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:53,026
But we were making more money
than we knew what to do with.

1614
01:06:57,472 --> 01:06:58,555
<i>And what do you do
when you're making</i>

1615
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,329
<i>more money than you
know what to do with?</i>

1616
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,544
Oh, my God!

1617
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:09,542
Will you marry me?

1618
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:11,443
Oh, my God.

1619
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,546
Is that a yes?

1620
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,280
Are you sure?

1621
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,258
Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure.

1622
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,018
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1623
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:33,199
<i>I held my bachelor party
at the Mirage in Las Vegas.</i>

1624
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:35,652
<i>The flight there alone
was a bacchanal.</i>

1625
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,803
<i>One last blowout for the gods</i>

1626
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,872
<i>before I settled down for good.</i>

1627
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,640
<i>A hundred Strattonites,</i>

1628
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:44,585
<i>50 hookers, plus 50 more
waiting once we landed.</i>

1629
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,270
<i>Oh, and the drugs.</i>

1630
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:50,217
<i>I mean, I tell you, our plane was
like a pharmacy with wings.</i>

1631
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:22,957
<i>All told, the weekend
cost me 2 million bucks,</i>

1632
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:28,079
<i>including the cost of refurbishing
the entire 28th floor.</i>

1633
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:30,480
kiss the bride.

1634
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:33,817
<i>Ah! But the wedding</i>

1635
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:36,046
<i>was something out of a fairy tale.</i>

1636
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:39,197
<i>With Naomi, my Duchess,</i>

1637
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,782
<i>me, her handsome Duke,</i>

1638
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,932
<i>and The Bahamas Ocean Club,
our castle.</i>

1639
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:57,633
<i>Of course, after the bachelor
party, me, the Duke,</i>

1640
01:08:57,634 --> 01:09:00,469
<i>needed a few penicillin shots
so he could</i>

1641
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,698
<i>safely consummate the marriage.</i>

1642
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,829
Hey! Barry Kleinman,
filming the wedding.

1643
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,376
A few words for your son?

1644
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:14,107
Jordan. Remember what I told you.

1645
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:17,319
It involves your penis
and her vagina.

1646
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:20,390
And you know,
you know what you can do, Jordy.

1647
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,174
Oh, my God!

1648
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,652
Aunt Emma?

1649
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:46,741
I can't believe you came!

1650
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:50,415
Jordan! Jordan! Look who came!

1651
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:52,205
It's Aunt Emma.

1652
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:54,419
Aunt Emma.

1653
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,884
- Oh, Jordan, dear, how lovely.
- Hey, how you doing?

1654
01:09:57,652 --> 01:10:00,426
It's a pleasure to finally meet you
in person.

1655
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:02,406
Into the donuts, I see.

1656
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:04,783
Oh, I... I...

1657
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:05,885
Well...

1658
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:09,246
I lived through the '60s, my dear.

1659
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:10,815
Enjoy the day.

1660
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,313
She surprised me.
I didn't even know.

1661
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,141
Just one more step. Are you ready?

1662
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:30,809
- Where are we going?
- Keep your eyes closed.

1663
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,253
One, two, three!

1664
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:35,748
What is this?

1665
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:36,982
It's your wedding present.

1666
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:38,108
What?

1667
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:40,428
It's your wedding present,
sweetheart.

1668
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:42,214
What?

1669
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:44,781
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

1670
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:45,929
A fucking yacht?

1671
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:48,994
<i>For millionaires
whose ships have come in,</i>

1672
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:51,830
<i>pricey pleasure boats
are for the most fun afloat.</i>

1673
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:55,041
<i>It's no coincidence that
its 150 feet of green hull</i>

1674
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:57,294
<i>is the color of cash.
Anchors aweigh!</i>

1675
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:59,648
Oh, my God! Baby!

1676
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,592
- I think you like it?
- You're crazy.

1677
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,115
- You like it?
- Yes!

1678
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:13,560
<i>For three weeks, we sailed
the Naomi through the Caribbean,</i>

1679
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,645
<i>eventually taking her home
to Long Island,</i>

1680
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:16,813
<i>where we bought a house.</i>

1681
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:19,508
<i>Seven acres on the Gold Coast
of Long Island.</i>

1682
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,068
<i>The most expensive real estate
in the world.</i>

1683
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:24,821
<i>With maids, cooks, landscapers,
you name it.</i>

1684
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:27,365
<i>We even had two guards
who worked in shifts.</i>

1685
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:28,809
<i>Both named Rocco.</i>

1686
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,774
<i>It was heaven on earth.</i>

1687
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,044
Wake up, you piece of shit!

1688
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:40,879
- Ow!
- Who's Venice?

1689
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,297
- Huh?
"Who?

1690
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,381
Who? Who?

1691
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,133
"Who?" What are you, a fucking owl?

1692
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,426
Who is she?

1693
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:47,886
Some little hooker you
were fucking last night?

1694
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,888
What the fuck are
you talking about? No.

1695
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,598
No way, baby, no!

1696
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,997
You were calling her
name in your sleep!

1697
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,746
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I don't...

1698
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:58,897
I don't even know who Venice is.

1699
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:01,233
What the fuck does that even mean?
Venice.

1700
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:04,087
That's the stupidest shit
I've ever heard in my fucking life!

1701
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,059
Venice...

1702
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,637
Venice, baby, where are you?

1703
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:14,643
Venice!

1704
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:16,850
Venice!

1705
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,583
Where'd you go?

1706
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:25,423
Oh, baby.
Oh, you're gonna play rough, huh?

1707
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:27,717
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- You like that?

1708
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:32,202
I like it. I like it. Ow.

1709
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:34,057
Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie.

1710
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:35,100
Wolfie?

1711
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,643
Yeah, it's my safe word, baby.
It's my safe word.

1712
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:38,353
I don't give a fuck
about your safe word!

1713
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,313
- Come on!
- Shut the fuck up!

1714
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:42,792
- Ahh!
- Shut up, you little bitch!

1715
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:45,318
You're a fucking
dirty little birdy!

1716
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:46,420
Owie!

1717
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,468
That's right.

1718
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:49,865
That's right! I forgot.

1719
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,434
I forgot, baby.

1720
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:53,618
Donnie and I were investing

1721
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,829
in a condominium complex in Venice.

1722
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,038
That's why all this confusion.

1723
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:58,623
Oh, you're investing in Italy?

1724
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,458
Not Italy. California.

1725
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:02,043
- Oh, California?
- Yeah.

1726
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,253
You're a lying piece of shit!

1727
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:04,504
Duchess, baby, come on.

1728
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:06,152
Don't you fucking "Duchess" me.

1729
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:07,799
Don't you "Duchess" me!

1730
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,904
Do you really think that I
don't know what you're up to?

1731
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:12,888
- You're a father now, Jordan.
- Yeah.

1732
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:14,389
- You're a father now.
- I know...

1733
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,141
And you're still
acting like an infant!

1734
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:18,916
God damn it!

1735
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:21,919
Baby, you know,
you got real anger issues.

1736
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:24,316
Who is the one who flew in here

1737
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:27,277
at 3:00 in the morning
on their stupid helicopter

1738
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:29,404
and woke up Skylar? That was you!

1739
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:32,133
Oh, Skylar! Oh, fucking bullshit!

1740
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:44,198
<i>Does it even matter to you</i>

1741
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:46,939
that I just had that driving range

1742
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:50,216
sodded with Bermuda grass, Jordan,

1743
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:52,135
- and now you fucking wrecked it!
- Oh, my God... Bermuda grass.

1744
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:54,034
No, you didn't research
the whole thing

1745
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,348
and deal with the fucking
golf course people!

1746
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:57,599
Oh, my God,

1747
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,185
you had to deal
with the golf course people, too!

1748
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:03,005
What a Greek tragedy, honey!
Oh, my God!

1749
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:05,982
You probably had to pay them
in cash with your hands!

1750
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:07,275
What a fucking burden.

1751
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,319
And actually do some work
besides swiping

1752
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,529
my fucking credit
card all day, huh?

1753
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:14,324
Because I can't keep track
of your professions, honey.

1754
01:14:14,325 --> 01:14:16,284
'Cause last month
you were a wine connoisseur.

1755
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,370
Now you're an aspiring
landscape architect!

1756
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:20,163
- Let me get that right... No!
- Fuck you!

1757
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:22,248
Don't fucking dare throw that

1758
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:24,818
fucking water at me.
Don't you fucking dare.

1759
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:27,150
All right, honey?

1760
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:28,755
Now will you just...

1761
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:30,715
We could talk this out, all right?

1762
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:33,160
We just use our words. You know?

1763
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:34,344
Communicate.

1764
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:35,662
Okay?

1765
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:37,494
Come on, sweetheart.

1766
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:39,541
Talk to me. Talk to me.

1767
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,685
Stop flexing your muscles, Jordan.

1768
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:43,478
You look like a fucking imbecile.

1769
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:44,562
Babe, come on.

1770
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:48,108
You should feel happy
you got a husband

1771
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:50,462
who's in such great
shape like this, huh?

1772
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:52,487
Come here.

1773
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,072
Come on, give me a kiss.

1774
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:55,240
You look so beautiful right now.

1775
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:56,449
- Come on.
- Kiss you?

1776
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:57,701
- You look so beautiful...
- Kiss you?

1777
01:14:57,702 --> 01:14:59,429
Yeah, give me one...

1778
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:01,705
Fuck you!

1779
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:03,808
<i>Ah, yes, my morning ritual.</i>

1780
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:06,251
<i>First I'd get up and
fight with Naomi</i>

1781
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,545
<i>about whatever it is I did
the night before.</i>

1782
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:10,839
<i>Next was a steam so
I could sweat out</i>

1783
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,674
<i>the drugs still in my system.</i>

1784
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:14,402
<i>Then I'd assess the damage.</i>

1785
01:15:14,552 --> 01:15:16,404
<i>Drown out my eyeballs.</i>

1786
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:19,014
<i>Take my "back pills"
to get the day started,</i>

1787
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:21,209
<i>then seek to make up with Naomi.</i>

1788
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:23,248
Good morning, Daddy.

1789
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:25,045
Where's my kiss?

1790
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:27,165
Whee!

1791
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:28,875
Hey, sweetheart.

1792
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:33,611
Does Daddy get a kiss
from both of his little girls, huh?

1793
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:35,071
Oh, no.

1794
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:38,241
No, Daddy doesn't even
get to touch Mommy

1795
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,094
for a very, very,

1796
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:41,930
very long time.

1797
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:45,206
Daddy's really sorry about what
he said in the other room.

1798
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:46,499
He didn't mean any of it.

1799
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,898
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

1800
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:51,029
And from now on,

1801
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:54,571
it's gonna be nothing but short,

1802
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:57,036
short skirts around the house.

1803
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,124
And you know something else, Daddy?

1804
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:09,215
Mommy is just so sick and
tired of wearing panties.

1805
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,923
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1806
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:16,759
In fact,

1807
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,493
she's decided to throw them

1808
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:24,768
all away.

1809
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:32,446
So take a good look, Daddy.

1810
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:35,924
You're gonna be seeing an awful
lot of this around the house.

1811
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,550
Oh, baby...

1812
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:39,119
Yeah, Mommy.

1813
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:41,535
- Yeah...
- But no touching.

1814
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:43,707
Oh, gosh.

1815
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:46,414
Ow.

1816
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:49,896
What's wrong, Daddy?

1817
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:51,340
Mmm, baby.

1818
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:54,631
God!

1819
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:57,467
Look at this shit.

1820
01:16:57,530 --> 01:17:01,351
Okay. Mommy likes to
play games with Daddy.

1821
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:05,684
Mommy, have you ever noticed

1822
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,640
anything odd about Mr...

1823
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,733
Mr. Fuzzy Bear over there?

1824
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:15,023
His eyes seem
to be a little bit odd, don't they?

1825
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:18,967
Yeah, there's something a little
bit different about his eyes.

1826
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:22,220
Yes!
I think it's true. Say "Hi," Mommy.

1827
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:24,180
Say "Hi" to Rocco and Rocco.

1828
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:25,640
<i>- Say "Hi." Hi, fellas.</i>

1829
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,058
See that, huh?

1830
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,893
<i>Of all the fucking days,</i>

1831
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,792
<i>she chooses today to
give me blue balls!</i>

1832
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,940
<i>I mean, today was the biggest day
in Stratton's history,</i>

1833
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:35,859
<i>and I needed to be
thinking straight.</i>

1834
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,337
Hey, Jordan!

1835
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:39,529
- Welcome.
- Steve here yet?

1836
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:42,759
<i>This was the day that we
launched the Steve Madden IPO.</i>

1837
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:44,951
Troops are all here,
everyone's all rallied, excited.

1838
01:17:44,952 --> 01:17:46,828
<i>Everything had to run tight.</i>

1839
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:47,954
<i>It had to be perfect.</i>

1840
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:49,648
What the fuck is that kid doing?

1841
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:51,859
What's he doing?

1842
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,478
The biggest IPO in
this firm's history.

1843
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:56,860
What the fuck is he doing?

1844
01:17:57,756 --> 01:17:59,858
Is he... Is he wearing a bow tie?

1845
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:01,242
Hi.

1846
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:03,428
How're you doing?

1847
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:04,576
Good.

1848
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,287
You cleaning the fish bowl?

1849
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:10,461
I just... I had a minute and...

1850
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:12,246
You had a minute.

1851
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:14,856
And today you needed to
clean the fish bowl? Today?

1852
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:18,632
I had finished my paperwork
and I had a couple of minutes.

1853
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,546
Okay. Nice to meet you.

1854
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:27,845
On new issue day?

1855
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:32,062
On cocksucking,
motherfucking new issue day?

1856
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:33,396
This is what you do?

1857
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:36,357
Hey, everybody, listen up!

1858
01:18:36,879 --> 01:18:39,607
This is what happens when you fuck
with your pets on new issue day!

1859
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:55,130
Take your little bow tie,
get your shit,

1860
01:18:55,356 --> 01:18:57,273
and get the fuck out of my office!
You understand?

1861
01:18:57,274 --> 01:18:58,876
Get the fuck out!

1862
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:04,030
Everybody on point!

1863
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:07,055
We are here to make money.
Everybody on point.

1864
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:12,288
<i>A real wolf pit,
which is exactly how I liked it.</i>

1865
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:14,999
Jordan, look what I caught in
the lobby. I caught a genius.

1866
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,568
<i>Enter Steve Madden.</i>

1867
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:17,752
The great American cobbler.

1868
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:20,231
<i>Red-hot ladies footwear Impresario.</i>

1869
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:23,883
<i>And thanks to Donnie,
we were taking his company public.</i>

1870
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:27,705
<i>Stratton Oakmont was crawling
out of the primordial ooze.</i>

1871
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,789
<i>Pond scum no more.</i>

1872
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:31,349
That's why they gotta
see your face.

1873
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,935
You get them fired up so they push
the shit out of this stock. Okay?

1874
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:36,604
<i>And not only that,
Donnie and I secretly owned</i>

1875
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:38,958
<i>85% of Steve Madden Shoes,</i>

1876
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:41,526
<i>which legally speaking
was a big no-no,</i>

1877
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:45,052
<i>but we'd get filthy fucking rich
if our troops got behind it.</i>

1878
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:47,634
<i>Our job was to get them worked up.</i>

1879
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:49,598
<i>- But not too worked up.</i>
- Shh.

1880
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:52,809
Hello. If, uh...

1881
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:55,475
For those of you who don't know me,
uh...

1882
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:56,833
My name's Steve Madden.

1883
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:58,668
Yeah, we know who you are.

1884
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:00,066
Your name is on the box.

1885
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,796
Get the shoes. Show them the shoes.

1886
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,490
- Show them the shoes.
- Okay. Yeah.

1887
01:20:03,674 --> 01:20:06,718
Anyway, you know,
this shoe is pretty cool.

1888
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:09,679
This is the Mary Lou, which is really
the shoe that put me on the map.

1889
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,347
Without it, I wouldn't be here.

1890
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:12,598
It's a fat girls' shoe!

1891
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:14,667
Believe it or not...
Believe it or not though,

1892
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:16,269
the Mary Lou is actually the same

1893
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:18,062
as the Mary Jane, but
it's black leather.

1894
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:24,402
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1895
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:26,301
Fight back! Come on!
Where you at? Where you at?

1896
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:28,906
All right!

1897
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:32,285
Let's give it up for Steve Madden
and his awesome Mary Lou!

1898
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:34,514
Hold that up. Hold that up.
Hold that up proud!

1899
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:37,107
Give him a round of applause!

1900
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:40,436
You guys got that
out of your systems, huh?

1901
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:43,355
You having a good
afternoon or what?

1902
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:46,966
I wanna take a moment
and tell you why Steve here is so

1903
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:49,365
absolutely off the fucking wall.

1904
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:52,198
It's because this man

1905
01:20:52,473 --> 01:20:54,166
is a creative genius.

1906
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,642
This ability, this gift

1907
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:58,245
that Steve has,

1908
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:59,854
it goes beyond just

1909
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,606
spotting the hottest shoe trends.

1910
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:05,507
Steve's power is that
he creates trends.

1911
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:06,883
You understand?

1912
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:09,530
Artists like Steve come along
once every decade.

1913
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:13,034
I'm talking Giorgio Armani,
Gianni Versace, Coco Chanel,

1914
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:14,728
Yves Saint Laurent.

1915
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,847
Steve, come over here for a second.

1916
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:19,103
I don't think you all realize

1917
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:21,143
that Steve Madden

1918
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:24,754
is the hottest person
in the women's shoe industry,

1919
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:26,130
with orders going through the roof

1920
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:29,576
at every department store
in North America right now.

1921
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:32,070
We have him here in our office!

1922
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,890
We should thank our fucking
lucky stars this man is here!

1923
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,559
We should be
on our hands and knees right now,

1924
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,728
getting ready to suck this guy off!

1925
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,046
Like this! Okay?

1926
01:21:43,524 --> 01:21:45,251
I wanna suck you off, Steve!

1927
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:47,719
Everyone's gonna suck you off!

1928
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:49,654
This is our golden ticket

1929
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,781
to the fucking chocolate factory
right here!

1930
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,055
And I wanna meet

1931
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:56,478
Willy fucking Wonka, okay?

1932
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:59,981
I wanna be with the
fucking Oompa Loompas like this!

1933
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:06,439
All right, get off this fucking stage!
Get out of here.

1934
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,366
All right, I want you all
to focus for a second.

1935
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,902
See those little black boxes?

1936
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:13,177
They're called telephones.

1937
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:16,055
I'm gonna let you in on a little
secret about these telephones.

1938
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:18,750
They're not gonna dial themselves.
Okay?

1939
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:22,588
Without you, they're just
worthless hunks of plastic.

1940
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:26,800
Like a loaded M16 without a trained
Marine to pull the trigger.

1941
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:30,257
And in the case of the telephone,

1942
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:33,048
it's up to each and
every one of you,

1943
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,644
my highly-trained Strattonites.

1944
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:39,058
My killers!

1945
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:43,105
My killers,
who will not take no for an answer!

1946
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:45,569
My fucking warriors,

1947
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:48,004
who will not hang up the phone

1948
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:51,048
until their client either buys

1949
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:53,301
or fucking dies!

1950
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:09,901
Let me tell you something.

1951
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:13,006
There is no nobility in poverty.

1952
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:16,449
I have been a rich man
and I have been a poor man.

1953
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:18,451
And I choose rich
every fucking time.

1954
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,412
Because at least as a rich man,

1955
01:23:21,413 --> 01:23:22,872
when I have to face my problems,

1956
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:24,832
I show up in the back of a limo,

1957
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,751
wearing a $2,000 suit

1958
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:29,480
and a $40,000 gold fucking watch!

1959
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:34,800
Duke it out! Hit him!

1960
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:36,323
Get the fuck off me!

1961
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,373
And if anyone here
thinks I'm superficial

1962
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:41,933
or materialistic,

1963
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:44,310
go get a job at fucking McDonald's,

1964
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:46,459
'cause that's where
you fucking belong!

1965
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:52,044
But before you depart
this room full of winners,

1966
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,070
I want you to take a good look

1967
01:23:54,071 --> 01:23:55,844
at the person next to you. Go on.

1968
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:59,218
Because sometime in
the not-so-distant future,

1969
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:00,993
you're gonna be pulling
up to a red light

1970
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:03,062
in your beat-up old fucking Pinto,

1971
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:06,457
and that person's gonna be
pulling up right alongside you

1972
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,686
in their brand new Porsche

1973
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:11,504
with their beautiful
wife by their side,

1974
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:13,047
who's got big voluptuous tits.

1975
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:17,468
And who're you gonna
be sitting next to?

1976
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:19,303
Some disgusting wildebeest

1977
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:20,888
with three days of razor-stubble,

1978
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,306
in a sleeveless muumuu,

1979
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:24,767
crammed in next to you
in a carload full of groceries

1980
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:26,602
from the fucking Price Club!

1981
01:24:26,603 --> 01:24:28,980
That's who you're gonna
be sitting next to!

1982
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:31,315
So you listen to me
and you listen well.

1983
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:33,669
Are you behind on your
credit card bills?

1984
01:24:33,986 --> 01:24:36,259
Good! Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

1985
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:39,221
Is your landlord ready
to evict you? Good!

1986
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:41,659
Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

1987
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:45,037
Does your girlfriend think
you're a fucking worthless loser?

1988
01:24:45,038 --> 01:24:47,982
Good! Pick up the
phone and start dialing!

1989
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:50,436
I want you to deal
with your problems

1990
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:51,711
by becoming rich!

1991
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,756
All you have to do today

1992
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:57,279
is pick up that phone

1993
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:00,912
and speak the words
that I have taught you.

1994
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:03,581
And I will make you richer

1995
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:05,141
than the most powerful CEO

1996
01:25:05,142 --> 01:25:06,726
in the United States
of fucking America!

1997
01:25:06,727 --> 01:25:08,329
Yeah!

1998
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:10,418
Fuck, yeah!

1999
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:13,133
I want you to go out there

2000
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:15,627
and I want you to ram

2001
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:19,238
Steve Madden stock
down your clients' throats

2002
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:21,637
until they fucking choke on it!

2003
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,118
Till they choke on it and they buy

2004
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,287
100,000 shares! That's what I want.

2005
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:27,872
Yeah! Fuck, yeah.

2006
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:29,646
You be ferocious!

2007
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:31,648
- You be relentless!
- Yeah!

2008
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:35,068
You be telephone
fucking terrorists!

2009
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:40,051
Now let's knock this motherfucker
out of the park!

2010
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:15,154
<i>At 1:00 p.m., we opened
the stock for sale at $4.50 a share.</i>

2011
01:26:15,212 --> 01:26:18,361
<i>By 1:03, it was over $18.</i>

2012
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:20,780
<i>Even the big Wall Street firms
were buying.</i>

2013
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:32,603
Of the two million shares
offered for sale,

2014
01:26:32,604 --> 01:26:35,606
a million belonged to me, held in
phony accounts by my ratholes.

2015
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:37,926
Now once the price hit
the high teens...

2016
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:40,194
You know what? Who gives a shit?

2017
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:41,922
As always, the point is this.

2018
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:46,760
$22 million in three fucking hours!

2019
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:49,763
Can you believe this shit?

2020
01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:52,248
- I fucking love this, baby!
- It's amazing!

2021
01:26:52,249 --> 01:26:53,475
Jordan!

2022
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,126
Barry Kleinman's on the phone

2023
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:56,877
- from Future Video.
- Who?

2024
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:58,170
I don't know.
He shot at your wedding.

2025
01:26:58,171 --> 01:26:59,296
He says it's urgent.

2026
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:01,507
Urgent?
Who the fuck is Barry Kleinman?

2027
01:27:01,508 --> 01:27:03,175
Oh, my God, you wanna marry me?

2028
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:04,301
You're in love with me?

2029
01:27:04,302 --> 01:27:05,449
Yeah. Go fuck your cousin!

2030
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:06,554
Hey, Barry, what's up?

2031
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:08,764
Listen, I got this subpoena.

2032
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:10,307
<i>Subpoena? What the fuck
are you talking about?</i>

2033
01:27:10,308 --> 01:27:11,892
Yeah, the FBI, they want a copy

2034
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:13,018
of your wedding video.

2035
01:27:13,019 --> 01:27:14,291
<i>The fucking FBI?</i>

2036
01:27:14,396 --> 01:27:16,313
- You fucking kidding me?
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

2037
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:17,690
<i>His name is Denham.</i>

2038
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:19,442
<i>He's an agent with
the New York office.</i>

2039
01:27:19,443 --> 01:27:20,568
<i>What's his problem?</i>

2040
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:23,297
<i>He's a Boy Scout. He thinks
you're fucking Gordon Gekko.</i>

2041
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:25,823
What does he want
with my wedding video?

2042
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:27,533
It's like an invasion
of my privacy.

2043
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:28,977
You know what I'm saying?
It's like...

2044
01:27:28,994 --> 01:27:30,369
It's intrusive, you know.

2045
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:33,122
He's got pictures of your
whole inner fucking circle.

2046
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:35,040
Pictures, names of the people.

2047
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:36,125
You know what he's trying to do?

2048
01:27:36,126 --> 01:27:37,334
Exactly what he's doing.
Look at yourself.

2049
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:38,627
He's trying to rattle you,

2050
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:40,171
he's trying to rattle
your old lady,

2051
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:43,007
so she nags you
until you become a fucking witness.

2052
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:44,508
He wants me to rat on myself?

2053
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:46,452
He wants me
to give information about my...

2054
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:48,345
Listen. The good fucking news is,

2055
01:27:48,346 --> 01:27:50,181
you know I know everybody downtown,

2056
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:52,516
I call up the Justice Department,
the DEA,

2057
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:55,712
nobody even knows you fucking
exist, so calm down!

2058
01:27:55,896 --> 01:27:57,213
They don't know I exist?

2059
01:27:57,355 --> 01:27:59,128
- No.
- That's good.

2060
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:05,154
But you...

2061
01:28:05,155 --> 01:28:06,723
You know who he is, right?

2062
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:09,408
- Yeah.
- So, if I just wanted to get

2063
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:11,452
some more information,
just find out what he knows,

2064
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:14,705
you could go to his house, right?

2065
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:16,707
Tap his phones a
little bit, bug him.

2066
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:17,875
You could get some information...

2067
01:28:17,876 --> 01:28:20,795
You don't fuck with
these guys like that.

2068
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:21,962
You don't fuck with them like that.

2069
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:23,214
What are you, nuts or something?

2070
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:24,924
This is what you fucking do.
What do I pay you for?

2071
01:28:24,925 --> 01:28:28,093
I have a fucking P.I. license, you know?
I make a living at this.

2072
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:29,220
I'm not a cop anymore.

2073
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:31,347
They'll take my fucking license
away from me, all right?

2074
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:32,495
Okay.

2075
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,494
Okay, if I can't do that,
can I just...

2076
01:28:35,685 --> 01:28:37,037
Can I give the guy a call?

2077
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:40,231
- Why? Is that...
- Jordan. Jordan.

2078
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:41,315
Do me a favor?

2079
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:44,318
The only one who calls this guy
is your fucking lawyer.

2080
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:45,402
I can't call him, right?

2081
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:47,238
- It's against the rules?
- I told you,

2082
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:48,989
whatever the fuck you say to him,

2083
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:51,700
he's gonna use against you.
Don't you understand?

2084
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:53,536
He's smart, you're dumb.

2085
01:28:53,537 --> 01:28:54,854
Fucking bullshit.

2086
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:56,664
Are we fucking talking tonight,

2087
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:57,915
or are you gonna get schwacked?

2088
01:28:57,916 --> 01:28:59,583
The last time you took
these fucking pills,

2089
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:02,064
you put your head in the fucking
macaroni. I had to pick it up.

2090
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:04,213
All right.

2091
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:05,941
Okay, I won't call him.

2092
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:10,845
Hey, fellas! Come on board.

2093
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:12,698
The plank's right around there.

2094
01:29:13,473 --> 01:29:14,825
Welcome!

2095
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:16,910
Whoo! What a nice day.

2096
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:20,087
Hey.

2097
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:21,835
Welcome aboard.

2098
01:29:22,482 --> 01:29:24,233
Jordan. Welcome aboard the <i>Naomi.</i>

2099
01:29:24,234 --> 01:29:25,359
Pleasure to meet you.

2100
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,861
Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes.

2101
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:27,987
Hi, how are you?

2102
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:31,323
Let me introduce you. This is Nicole,
Heidi. Come on. Don't be shy.

2103
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:33,909
What are you guys all shy for?
Don't be scared.

2104
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:35,160
These are friends of Stratton.

2105
01:29:35,161 --> 01:29:36,433
- It's a pleasure.
- Hello.

2106
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:38,727
Um...

2107
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:42,902
Your message said
that you wanted to speak privately.

2108
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:44,779
Right. I do want to
speak privately.

2109
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:46,193
Give us a minute, huh, ladies?

2110
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:47,798
Let me know if I can
get you anything.

2111
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:49,151
We'd be happy to help.

2112
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:50,968
You guys hungry?

2113
01:29:50,969 --> 01:29:52,052
Want something to eat?

2114
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:53,888
Got some pasta, shrimp, lobster.

2115
01:29:53,889 --> 01:29:56,307
I got whiskey.
Any kind of booze you want.

2116
01:29:56,308 --> 01:29:57,892
You know what?
The Bureau doesn't allow us

2117
01:29:57,893 --> 01:29:59,461
to drink while we're at sea.

2118
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:00,704
Duh! Of course.

2119
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,957
Ever been on one of these before?

2120
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:05,379
A boat?

2121
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:07,401
I learned how to
sail when I was six.

2122
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:09,570
No shit. Is that right? Really?

2123
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:11,363
On one like this, though?

2124
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:14,263
I had the whole front extended in
order to fit the chopper up there.

2125
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:15,681
See that?

2126
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:18,287
Anyway, this is for you.

2127
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:21,332
It's a complete list of every
person that was at my wedding.

2128
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:24,168
I understand you wanted
the whole wedding video.

2129
01:30:24,169 --> 01:30:27,004
Figured this would help
expedite the whole process, right?

2130
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:28,839
- There you go.
- Look,

2131
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,090
my point is that

2132
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:31,842
I know you're
investigating Stratton.

2133
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:35,447
But for the life of me,
I can't figure out why.

2134
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,932
I know we're a little unorthodox,
we're a little

2135
01:30:37,933 --> 01:30:40,017
loud in the way we do things.
But you gotta understand,

2136
01:30:40,018 --> 01:30:41,393
we're the new guys on the block,
you know,

2137
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:44,043
we're trying to make
a name for ourselves.

2138
01:30:44,189 --> 01:30:46,838
But I want you to
understand, we don't

2139
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:48,631
do anything illegal.

2140
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:50,527
Whatsoever.

2141
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,154
I mean, you could talk to the SEC.

2142
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:55,199
They were at my office 15 times
over the last six months.

2143
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,644
I mean, I got...
I got nothing to hide.

2144
01:30:57,744 --> 01:31:00,829
Well, you know the SEC is
a civil regulatory agency.

2145
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:02,456
We pursue criminal activities.

2146
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:05,401
Exactly! You go after
real criminals, which

2147
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:08,379
makes me wonder what the hell
you're investigating me for?

2148
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,403
I mean, honestly...

2149
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:14,426
What is it that you think
that we did or do? I don't get it.

2150
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:15,761
Well, I...

2151
01:31:15,762 --> 01:31:18,222
Look, Jordan, I can't discuss
an ongoing investigation.

2152
01:31:18,223 --> 01:31:20,041
No, I get that. No, I understand.

2153
01:31:20,058 --> 01:31:21,580
With that said...

2154
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:24,228
This case got dumped on my desk...

2155
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:25,896
- Did it?
- You know, by a higher-up

2156
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:27,231
who needs to make a show

2157
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:29,441
of looking into the new company
on the block,

2158
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:30,919
- with all the press and everything.
- New loud guys.

2159
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:32,820
And then I end up being the schmuck

2160
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:34,571
who does the looking. Exactly.

2161
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:36,657
It's just, you know...
It bothers me.

2162
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:38,075
We're the new guy. We're the one

2163
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:40,452
that's banging on Wall Street's door.
I mean, you should...

2164
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:42,413
You should see what's going
on at the bigger firms.

2165
01:31:42,414 --> 01:31:44,016
I mean, I know all the information.

2166
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:47,061
It's true! Goldman,
Lehman Brothers, Merrill...

2167
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:49,070
Collateralized debt obligations?

2168
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:50,421
This Internet stock bullshit?

2169
01:31:50,422 --> 01:31:52,297
I mean, it's a fucking travesty.

2170
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:54,550
I could take you step-by-step

2171
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:57,370
through what exactly is occurring.

2172
01:31:57,554 --> 01:31:59,247
All you have to do is ask.

2173
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:00,702
I'm available.

2174
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:02,433
- That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
- Mmm-hmm.

2175
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:05,413
I don't see why a
little sitdown like this

2176
01:32:05,979 --> 01:32:07,604
can't be profitable
for the both of us.

2177
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:09,940
It should. Right?
It should profit the both of us.

2178
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:11,588
- It should.
- Look.

2179
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:14,319
I'm gonna give you
my personal line.

2180
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:17,344
Five days a week,
you just call me, feel free.

2181
01:32:17,449 --> 01:32:19,267
- I'll do that.
- Great.

2182
01:32:21,745 --> 01:32:23,495
Are you sure you guys don't
want something to drink?

2183
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:25,247
You're not hungry? Nothing?

2184
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:26,975
- Nothing? No?
- Oh, no.

2185
01:32:30,003 --> 01:32:31,128
Let me ask you,

2186
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:32,629
and if you don't wanna
get too personal,

2187
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:34,903
- just tell me to shut up at any time.
- Oh.

2188
01:32:35,842 --> 01:32:38,552
Did you try to get
your broker's license at one time?

2189
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:41,497
Did I hear that right? Were you
trying to take a stab at Wall Street?

2190
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:44,308
- No?
- Who you been talking to?

2191
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:45,392
Who the fuck you been talking to?

2192
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:46,518
Well, you're investigating me.

2193
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:48,062
I hear things.

2194
01:32:48,063 --> 01:32:49,506
You know what I mean?

2195
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:52,066
You ever think about
what would've happened

2196
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:54,761
if you would have
stayed the course?

2197
01:32:55,945 --> 01:32:57,821
You know what?
When I'm riding home on the subway

2198
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:59,198
and my balls are fucking sweating,

2199
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:01,075
I'm wearing the same suit
three days in a row...

2200
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:02,659
Yeah, you bet I do.

2201
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,495
I've thought about it before.
Who wouldn't, right?

2202
01:33:04,496 --> 01:33:05,621
Right, who fucking wouldn't?

2203
01:33:05,622 --> 01:33:06,789
What do you get...

2204
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:08,123
Another personal question,
no need to answer...

2205
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:09,583
No, that's all right, Jordan.

2206
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:12,733
What do you pull in? 50, 60K?
Something like that?

2207
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:14,838
- A year? In the ballpark?
- Oh.

2208
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:16,381
Well, I...

2209
01:33:16,382 --> 01:33:18,258
Let's put it this way.

2210
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:19,551
You get a free handgun

2211
01:33:19,552 --> 01:33:21,432
when you sign up for the Bureau.

2212
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:24,014
No, but it fucking pisses me off.
You know what I mean?

2213
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:26,266
You think about the people
that built this country,

2214
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:27,768
hardworking people like you.

2215
01:33:27,769 --> 01:33:30,418
Firefighters, teachers, FBI agents.

2216
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:34,191
End of the day, you guys get
fucking skinned alive financially.

2217
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:36,151
It fucking makes me angry.

2218
01:33:36,152 --> 01:33:39,301
Now the one thing about Wall Street
and this market is,

2219
01:33:39,322 --> 01:33:41,095
for me, I feel

2220
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:44,493
it's good to give back.
You know, there's...

2221
01:33:44,494 --> 01:33:46,745
There are situations where I can

2222
01:33:46,746 --> 01:33:50,374
make those situations better
for people. You know?

2223
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:51,750
You know what I mean.

2224
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:53,273
Opportunity

2225
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:54,795
is everything.

2226
01:33:54,796 --> 01:33:56,148
Exactly.

2227
01:33:56,172 --> 01:33:58,715
Take for example,
I got this one kid, right?

2228
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:02,553
Went to school for environmental
science, something like that.

2229
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:04,471
He was bogged down
by student loans.

2230
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:06,974
Turns out, his mother needed
triple bypass surgery.

2231
01:34:06,975 --> 01:34:08,725
- Jesus.
- Right. Horrible situation.

2232
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:09,810
Sure.

2233
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:10,978
But we got him into the market

2234
01:34:10,979 --> 01:34:12,729
at the right time
and chose the right stock.

2235
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:14,565
We gave him the right guidance.

2236
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:17,340
Boom! Overnight,
changed his entire life.

2237
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:19,486
Got to put his mother into

2238
01:34:19,487 --> 01:34:21,321
the best hospital in New York City.

2239
01:34:21,322 --> 01:34:22,489
It didn't work out for her,

2240
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:24,283
granted, she passed
away, unfortunately.

2241
01:34:24,284 --> 01:34:26,243
But we gave him that opportunity.

2242
01:34:26,244 --> 01:34:27,516
You know what I'm saying?

2243
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:29,913
It's just about setting
up the right team,

2244
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:32,767
and then overnight
your life can change.

2245
01:34:38,047 --> 01:34:40,570
What does... What does an intern...

2246
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:43,927
What does an intern
make in a deal like that?

2247
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:46,076
Well, in that situation,

2248
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:50,080
in that particular trade,
and it was one trade,

2249
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:52,917
north of half a million dollars.

2250
01:34:56,441 --> 01:34:58,775
And I'd do that for
anybody, you know,

2251
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:01,550
anybody that needs
the proper guidance.

2252
01:35:21,257 --> 01:35:23,359
Can you say that again,

2253
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:25,286
just the way you said it?

2254
01:35:25,762 --> 01:35:27,580
Just the same way.

2255
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:30,457
Oh.

2256
01:35:31,684 --> 01:35:32,809
I don't know what
you're talking about.

2257
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:34,753
Oh, come on!
You know what I'm talking about.

2258
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,253
I think what Jordan
just did is he...

2259
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:38,482
- If I'm not mistaken...
- No.

2260
01:35:38,483 --> 01:35:40,692
you just tried to
bribe a federal officer.

2261
01:35:40,693 --> 01:35:42,861
No, technically I
didn't bribe anybody.

2262
01:35:42,862 --> 01:35:45,364
No, no, that's not the conversation
I heard, Jordan.

2263
01:35:45,365 --> 01:35:46,949
No, no, according to
the U.S. criminal code,

2264
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:48,867
there needs to be an
exact dollar figure

2265
01:35:48,868 --> 01:35:50,452
- for the exchange of services.
- Oh!

2266
01:35:50,453 --> 01:35:52,162
That would not hold
up in a court of law.

2267
01:35:52,163 --> 01:35:53,914
Nah, it's not howl heard it.

2268
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:56,667
No, no, no, that's the truth.
But I want to tell you this.

2269
01:35:56,668 --> 01:35:57,793
Yeah.

2270
01:35:57,794 --> 01:35:59,378
The same gentleman that told me

2271
01:35:59,379 --> 01:36:01,213
that you tried to get
your broker's license

2272
01:36:01,214 --> 01:36:03,442
also told me that
you are a straight arrow.

2273
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:05,008
He ran a security check on me.

2274
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:06,235
Well...

2275
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:09,388
Yeah, when you sail
on a boat fit for a Bond villain,

2276
01:36:09,389 --> 01:36:11,617
sometimes you need to
play the part. Right?

2277
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:14,851
I think it's time you both
get the fuck off my boat.

2278
01:36:14,852 --> 01:36:16,920
What do you say? Hmm?

2279
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:18,522
You know, Jordan,
I'll tell you something.

2280
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:21,627
Most of the Wall Street jackasses
that I bust,

2281
01:36:21,985 --> 01:36:24,403
they're to the manor born.

2282
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:25,570
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

2283
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:27,281
Their fathers are douchebags,

2284
01:36:27,282 --> 01:36:29,305
just like their
fathers before them.

2285
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:31,803
But you...

2286
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:35,852
You, Jordan,
you got this way all on your own.

2287
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:37,141
Did I?

2288
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:39,314
- Good for you, little man.
- Little man?

2289
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:40,711
Good for you.

2290
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:41,962
Me, the little man?

2291
01:36:41,963 --> 01:36:43,088
And let me tell you something.

2292
01:36:43,089 --> 01:36:45,157
Let me tell you something else.

2293
01:36:45,383 --> 01:36:47,384
Honestly,
I'm not bullshitting here,

2294
01:36:47,385 --> 01:36:48,552
this is one of the nicest boats

2295
01:36:48,553 --> 01:36:50,679
- that I've ever been on, I gotta tell you.
- I bet it is.

2296
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:52,360
And you know
what I was just thinking, too?

2297
01:36:52,598 --> 01:36:55,600
The fucking hero that I'm
gonna be back at the office

2298
01:36:55,601 --> 01:36:57,874
when the Bureau seizes
this fucking boat.

2299
01:36:57,895 --> 01:37:00,147
Because, I mean,
fuckety-fuck-fuck, Jordan,

2300
01:37:00,148 --> 01:37:01,815
look at this thing!

2301
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:02,899
It's beautiful!

2302
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:05,986
And you got the beautiful
girls there. It's wonderful.

2303
01:37:05,987 --> 01:37:08,510
All right, get the
fuck off my boat.

2304
01:37:08,614 --> 01:37:10,240
I'm sure we'll be seeing each other

2305
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:11,366
- real soon.
- I'm sure.

2306
01:37:11,367 --> 01:37:12,909
Good luck on that subway ride home

2307
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:14,911
to your miserable,
ugly fucking wives.

2308
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:18,081
I'm gonna have Heidi lick some
caviar off my balls in the meantime.

2309
01:37:18,082 --> 01:37:20,834
Hey, you guys want to take some
lobsters for your ride home?

2310
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:23,545
Fucking miserable pricks,
I know you can't afford them!

2311
01:37:23,546 --> 01:37:25,444
Fucking cheap fucks.

2312
01:37:25,757 --> 01:37:28,030
Fucking miserable pricks.

2313
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:31,345
Hey, fellas! Look what I
found in my pocket! Look!

2314
01:37:31,346 --> 01:37:33,180
A year's salary right here.

2315
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:35,932
You know what I call them?
Fun coupons!

2316
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:37,285
See that!

2317
01:37:37,727 --> 01:37:39,829
They're fun coupons!

2318
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:50,389
Switzerland?
What the fuck is in Switzerland?

2319
01:37:50,406 --> 01:37:52,491
<i>Swiss fucking banks, that's what.</i>

2320
01:37:52,492 --> 01:37:55,266
<i>It was ass-covering time.
I had to hide my money.</i>

2321
01:37:56,454 --> 01:37:58,056
<i>Enter Rugrat.</i>

2322
01:37:58,122 --> 01:37:59,790
<i>He knew this Swiss banker
from law school.</i>

2323
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:00,957
That's for European pussy!

2324
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:02,292
<i>But he was in Geneva.</i>

2325
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:04,737
<i>And there was no way
I was gonna make that flight sober.</i>

2326
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:08,215
<i>So I knew if I took my drugs right,</i>

2327
01:38:08,216 --> 01:38:10,364
<i>I could sleep through
the entire flight.</i>

2328
01:38:10,676 --> 01:38:13,120
<i>But I had to take them just right.</i>

2329
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:15,740
<i>At 4:00 p.m., I popped
a few more ludes,</i>

2330
01:38:15,765 --> 01:38:17,307
<i>which started kicking
in by the time</i>

2331
01:38:17,308 --> 01:38:19,160
<i>I finished my sales meeting.</i>

2332
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:20,627
<i>My tingle phase.</i>

2333
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:22,604
<i>By dinner, I popped a few more</i>

2334
01:38:22,605 --> 01:38:25,629
<i>on top of some cocktails
and a Valium or two.</i>

2335
01:38:25,691 --> 01:38:27,259
<i>My slur phase.</i>

2336
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:31,764
<i>By 8:30, I took a few more ludes</i>

2337
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:34,600
<i>and pretty much lost
all my motor skills.</i>

2338
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:36,344
<i>This was the drool phase.</i>

2339
01:38:39,288 --> 01:38:42,749
<i>And by 10:00, I didn't know
who or what the fuck I was.</i>

2340
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:44,443
<i>The amnesia phase.</i>

2341
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:47,295
<i>We boarded the plane
just before midnight.</i>

2342
01:38:47,296 --> 01:38:49,089
Wow! Look at you!

2343
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:51,158
- You're beautiful.
- Excuse me, sir.

2344
01:38:51,259 --> 01:38:53,510
His sleeping pills just kicked in.
He's all right.

2345
01:38:53,511 --> 01:38:55,137
May I see your
boarding passes, sir?

2346
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:56,956
We have the boarding passes.

2347
01:38:57,014 --> 01:38:59,116
Jesus Christ, I wanna fuck her.

2348
01:38:59,642 --> 01:39:01,460
Hey! Fucking relax.

2349
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:03,687
Oh, my God! You got your
hand on my fucking cock!

2350
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:05,147
I don't. Cut it out.

2351
01:39:05,148 --> 01:39:06,189
He's got his hand on my dick again.

2352
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:07,315
I'm just trying to buckle you up.

2353
01:39:07,316 --> 01:39:08,608
You got your hand on his dick?

2354
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:10,632
You gotta stop doing that
in public places.

2355
01:39:10,653 --> 01:39:12,721
Oh, my God. Take it off!

2356
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:13,989
Take it off!

2357
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:17,060
I heard there's a treasure map
under here.

2358
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:19,453
- Stop! I know, miss.
- Excuse me, sir.

2359
01:39:19,454 --> 01:39:20,976
Please sit down.

2360
01:39:21,164 --> 01:39:22,539
- Watch it.
- Go back to your seat, please.

2361
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,938
- What are you upset about?
- Please go back to your seat.

2362
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:26,877
I will have to call the captain.

2363
01:39:26,878 --> 01:39:29,504
Please, sir, please, sir. Sit down.

2364
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:31,256
- Please sit down!
- Ow!

2365
01:39:31,257 --> 01:39:32,883
- I'm going! Stop.
- Okay, sorry.

2366
01:39:32,884 --> 01:39:34,577
We apologize.
We're gonna go to sleep.

2367
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:36,077
Question. I wanna
ask you a question.

2368
01:39:36,095 --> 01:39:37,492
Fasten your seat belt, sir.

2369
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:39,723
We cannot take off
if you haven't fastened

2370
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:40,849
- your seat belt.
- I'm really horny, too.

2371
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:42,058
Sit down. Fasten it.

2372
01:39:42,059 --> 01:39:43,643
- Right. Okay, I'll sit down...
- I will do it for you.

2373
01:39:43,644 --> 01:39:44,728
- What?
- I'll do it for you.

2374
01:39:44,729 --> 01:39:45,979
You gotta speak English.

2375
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:48,023
We don't understand
this language you're speaking.

2376
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:49,626
I will help him with his seat belt.

2377
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:52,896
- You gotta put it on right.
- Sit back. Sit back, sir.

2378
01:39:52,904 --> 01:39:54,988
- There you go.
- All right. I'll just lean back...

2379
01:39:57,241 --> 01:39:59,014
<i>Bitte, Hilfe!</i>

2380
01:40:14,217 --> 01:40:15,592
Jesus Christ!

2381
01:40:15,593 --> 01:40:17,070
Fuck!

2382
01:40:18,638 --> 01:40:20,096
Donnie...

2383
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:23,326
Donnie, this isn't funny.
You gotta untie me, buddy.

2384
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:25,644
I can't untie you.

2385
01:40:25,645 --> 01:40:27,020
The captain tied you up.

2386
01:40:27,021 --> 01:40:28,589
He almost fucking tasered you.

2387
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,587
Why?

2388
01:40:30,816 --> 01:40:31,963
Why?

2389
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:34,886
He's got a fear of flying.

2390
01:40:36,072 --> 01:40:37,549
Ah!

2391
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,784
He's very nervous
on planes, I'm sorry,

2392
01:40:40,785 --> 01:40:42,808
it's not you, sweetheart,
don't beat yourself up.

2393
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:45,807
Easy, easy. He's fine.
He's just a nervous flyer.

2394
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:48,124
You were screaming at people.

2395
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:49,584
Oh, fuck off.

2396
01:40:49,585 --> 01:40:51,795
You were on the floor
rolling around and shit.

2397
01:40:51,796 --> 01:40:52,921
Oh, Jesus.

2398
01:40:52,922 --> 01:40:55,090
You called the captain the N-word.

2399
01:40:55,091 --> 01:40:56,675
I called the captain the N-word?

2400
01:40:56,676 --> 01:40:59,199
- Yeah, he was very upset.
- Really?

2401
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:01,747
- Luckily we're in first class.
- Jesus.

2402
01:41:02,181 --> 01:41:05,410
Jesus Christ, I think
you have a fucking drug problem.

2403
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:07,957
Where are the ludes?

2404
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:09,080
Where are the ludes?

2405
01:41:09,814 --> 01:41:11,606
They're up my ass.
Don't worry about it.

2406
01:41:11,607 --> 01:41:13,316
- I got it.
- Okay.

2407
01:41:13,317 --> 01:41:15,010
Thank God.

2408
01:41:15,444 --> 01:41:16,778
Jesus Christ, what are we gonna do

2409
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:17,904
when we get to Switzerland, buddy?

2410
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:18,989
This is bad.

2411
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:20,991
Fucking things are against my
chest. I can't breathe.

2412
01:41:20,992 --> 01:41:22,701
Come on, do something
to calm me down. Please.

2413
01:41:22,702 --> 01:41:24,536
Okay, shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

2414
01:41:25,788 --> 01:41:26,980
Okay. Shh! Shh!

2415
01:41:28,082 --> 01:41:29,165
That's good.

2416
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:30,959
- Go to sleep.
- Rub it harder, buddy.

2417
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,653
You're all right.

2418
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:35,235
We all love you. Shut the fuck up!

2419
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:42,322
Mr. Belfort,

2420
01:41:42,555 --> 01:41:43,952
you're free to go.

2421
01:41:45,975 --> 01:41:47,122
Really?

2422
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:51,187
Whoo!

2423
01:41:51,188 --> 01:41:52,397
- Hey, Donnie.
- Yeah?

2424
01:41:52,398 --> 01:41:54,190
When we get out there,
try not to act like yourself.

2425
01:41:54,191 --> 01:41:56,359
Okay? Let's make Geneva an
asshole-free Donnie zone, all right?

2426
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:57,819
What are you
fucking coming at me for?

2427
01:41:57,820 --> 01:41:59,446
Hey, listen. The only reason
you're sitting in this limo

2428
01:41:59,447 --> 01:42:01,072
and not in a Swiss jail
is because of my friend. Okay?

2429
01:42:01,073 --> 01:42:02,157
<i>Hilfe!</i>

2430
01:42:03,326 --> 01:42:05,849
We're here. We're here.
Everyone calm down.

2431
01:42:06,287 --> 01:42:07,809
Jordan Belfort!

2432
01:42:07,955 --> 01:42:09,039
At last.

2433
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:11,768
Nicholas has told me
so much about you.

2434
01:42:11,876 --> 01:42:13,853
Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.

2435
01:42:13,878 --> 01:42:16,119
- Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- Nice to meet you.

2436
01:42:16,505 --> 01:42:18,173
It's a joke.

2437
01:42:18,174 --> 01:42:20,527
You'll understand
when you're in the fucking seat.

2438
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:22,302
You need a bigger couch.
For guests.

2439
01:42:22,303 --> 01:42:24,262
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I don't understand. I'm sorry.

2440
01:42:24,263 --> 01:42:27,207
I'm curious about
your bank secrecy laws here.

2441
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:32,000
Uh... Wait. Yes.
Excusez-moi, Jordan.

2442
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,629
Swiss custom requires
10 minutes of...

2443
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:36,733
Blah, blah, blah.

2444
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:38,443
- Chit chat.
- Yeah, chit chat, thank you.

2445
01:42:38,444 --> 01:42:40,171
before business can be discussed.

2446
01:42:41,614 --> 01:42:42,840
Yeah.

2447
01:42:45,534 --> 01:42:46,681
Of course.

2448
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:50,143
Let's get down to it.
What would you like to know?

2449
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:53,541
Under what circumstances
would you be obligated

2450
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:55,815
to cooperate with an FBI

2451
01:42:56,087 --> 01:42:59,282
or a U.S. Justice Department
investigation, for example?

2452
01:42:59,799 --> 01:43:01,071
<i>Ca depend.</i>

2453
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:02,864
<i>Ca depend?</i>

2454
01:43:03,386 --> 01:43:04,487
<i>Oui.</i>

2455
01:43:04,887 --> 01:43:07,661
Ca depend on what, exactly?

2456
01:43:08,349 --> 01:43:10,684
Whether America plans
to invade Switzerland

2457
01:43:10,685 --> 01:43:12,628
in the coming months.

2458
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:15,021
Shall I check if tanks are
rolling down the Rue de la Croy?

2459
01:43:15,022 --> 01:43:17,216
- Yes. Rue de la Croix.
- Croix. Croix.

2460
01:43:17,733 --> 01:43:20,235
Not Croy. Not Rue de la Croy.
It's Croix.

2461
01:43:20,236 --> 01:43:22,529
See, this is what he used to do
back in law school. Check me.

2462
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:24,364
- Champagne. Champagne.
- Yeah.

2463
01:43:24,365 --> 01:43:26,342
Yeah, yeah. French
fries, pommes frites.

2464
01:43:27,493 --> 01:43:30,142
- And that kind of stuff.
- That's funny.

2465
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:34,207
<i>What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,</i>

2466
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:36,606
<i>is are you going to fuck me over?</i>

2467
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:42,905
<i>I understand
perfectly, you American shit.</i>

2468
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:47,429
The only way
the Banque Ral de Genve

2469
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:49,624
would cooperate
with a foreign legal body

2470
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,599
is if the crime being pursued

2471
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,873
is also a crime in Switzerland.

2472
01:43:53,894 --> 01:43:58,481
But there are very few Swiss laws
which apply to your practices.

2473
01:43:58,482 --> 01:43:59,649
Hmm.

2474
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:01,359
From a financial standpoint,

2475
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:02,803
you are now

2476
01:44:03,112 --> 01:44:04,555
in heaven.

2477
01:44:04,613 --> 01:44:06,590
See, I told you he was
fantastic, right?

2478
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:11,892
If the U.S. Justice Department
sent us a subpoena, it would become

2479
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:13,723
<i>papier toilette.</i>

2480
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:16,249
We would wipe our ass with it.

2481
01:44:17,668 --> 01:44:20,336
Unless, of course, it
was an investigation

2482
01:44:20,337 --> 01:44:22,255
into stock fraud,

2483
01:44:22,256 --> 01:44:24,507
which is a crime here in
Switzerland, if I'm correct.

2484
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:28,613
Then there would have to
be <i>coopration</i> on your part,

2485
01:44:28,637 --> 01:44:30,284
- if I'm not mistaken.
- Yes.

2486
01:44:30,765 --> 01:44:33,288
Yes, we would. Mmm-hmm.

2487
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,828
Assuming the account is
under your name.

2488
01:44:37,104 --> 01:44:38,706
If it were

2489
01:44:38,856 --> 01:44:40,253
another name,

2490
01:44:41,358 --> 01:44:43,193
a friend's, camarade...

2491
01:44:43,194 --> 01:44:44,420
Cousin?

2492
01:44:48,908 --> 01:44:50,726
- Relative?
- Yeah.

2493
01:44:51,243 --> 01:44:52,469
Hmm.

2494
01:44:52,828 --> 01:44:55,556
<i>Was that yodeling I just heard</i>

2495
01:44:55,581 --> 01:44:58,124
<i>or did you just say
what I thought you said?</i>

2496
01:44:58,125 --> 01:44:59,977
Yes. Yes.

2497
01:45:00,628 --> 01:45:03,277
<i>He's telling me
to use a fucking rathole.</i>

2498
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:05,131
<i>But a U.S. rathole would never get</i>

2499
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:07,425
<i>into Switzerland
with all that money.</i>

2500
01:45:07,426 --> 01:45:11,372
<i>What I needed was a rathole
with a European passport.</i>

2501
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:20,063
Jordan.

2502
01:45:20,064 --> 01:45:23,024
Hey. How's my favorite aunt, huh?

2503
01:45:23,025 --> 01:45:24,526
Welcome. Was the traffic terrible?

2504
01:45:24,527 --> 01:45:26,174
Oh, no, not at all.

2505
01:45:28,614 --> 01:45:30,341
Jordan, come in.

2506
01:45:30,407 --> 01:45:33,010
<i>Thank God Aunt Emma didn't
need too much convincing.</i>

2507
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:36,180
<i>Turned out the British weren't
too different from the Swiss.</i>

2508
01:45:36,247 --> 01:45:38,725
<i>Money talks and
bullshit takes the bus.</i>

2509
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:41,231
<i>How do you say
"rathole" in British?</i>

2510
01:45:41,544 --> 01:45:44,087
If you get into any
trouble whatsoever,

2511
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:46,923
I'll come forth immediately.
I'll say that I duped you.

2512
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:48,321
That I promise.

2513
01:45:48,926 --> 01:45:51,654
Risk is what keeps us young,
isn't it, darling?

2514
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:57,831
Sometimes I wonder

2515
01:45:58,102 --> 01:46:01,145
if you let money get the
best of you, my love.

2516
01:46:01,146 --> 01:46:02,372
Among

2517
01:46:02,731 --> 01:46:04,378
other substances.

2518
01:46:04,775 --> 01:46:06,877
Oh.

2519
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:10,154
It's that obvious, huh?

2520
01:46:10,155 --> 01:46:13,509
It's chilly, darling,
and you're sweating bullets.

2521
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,063
What can I say? I'm...

2522
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:20,604
I'm a drug addict.

2523
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:22,067
I really am.

2524
01:46:23,002 --> 01:46:24,854
Cocaine, pills.

2525
01:46:25,254 --> 01:46:27,777
Whatever it is, I'll fucking do it.

2526
01:46:28,215 --> 01:46:30,008
Now that's the truth.

2527
01:46:30,009 --> 01:46:31,342
I mean...

2528
01:46:31,343 --> 01:46:32,820
I'm a sex addict, too.

2529
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:36,139
Well, there are worse things
to be addicted to than sex.

2530
01:46:37,349 --> 01:46:39,809
Jesus, why am I telling
you all this? Why am I...

2531
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:41,537
I'm sorry.

2532
01:46:42,187 --> 01:46:44,506
Because I'm very easy to talk to.

2533
01:46:44,773 --> 01:46:47,592
- You are. You are easy to talk to.
- Mmm.

2534
01:46:48,652 --> 01:46:50,153
I suppose it's...

2535
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:51,676
Just my job, you know.

2536
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:54,574
All these people dependent on me.

2537
01:46:54,575 --> 01:46:57,474
Tens of millions of dollars
at stake, you know.

2538
01:46:57,661 --> 01:46:59,454
Sometimes I feel like I...

2539
01:46:59,455 --> 01:47:02,729
I've bitten off more
than I can chew, you know.

2540
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:04,935
You're a man with large appetites.

2541
01:47:05,294 --> 01:47:06,486
Yeah.

2542
01:47:08,088 --> 01:47:10,111
<i>Is she fucking hitting on me?</i>

2543
01:47:10,341 --> 01:47:11,488
Yeah.

2544
01:47:11,508 --> 01:47:12,905
Yeah, I am.

2545
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:18,328
I suppose I put that
on myself though, right?

2546
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:20,496
My decision.

2547
01:47:20,893 --> 01:47:22,435
It's just hard to...

2548
01:47:22,436 --> 01:47:26,461
Hard to learn to control
the anxiety sometimes, you know?

2549
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:28,588
You know, to...

2550
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:31,678
Learn to relax and let go and...

2551
01:47:32,363 --> 01:47:34,465
To release the tension.

2552
01:47:35,407 --> 01:47:36,975
<i>She is hitting on me.</i>

2553
01:47:37,826 --> 01:47:39,348
<i>Holy shit!</i>

2554
01:47:39,536 --> 01:47:41,809
Yeah, to release the tension.

2555
01:47:45,626 --> 01:47:47,478
I suppose we, uh...

2556
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,364
We all just need to learn, uh...

2557
01:47:50,881 --> 01:47:54,281
Learn to do what comes
naturally in life, you know?

2558
01:47:56,095 --> 01:47:58,664
<i>Is he fucking hitting on me?</i>

2559
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:06,521
Stability, dear.

2560
01:48:06,522 --> 01:48:08,044
Family.

2561
01:48:14,697 --> 01:48:16,845
You take care of my niece, my love.

2562
01:48:17,032 --> 01:48:19,305
I'll take care of
everything over here.

2563
01:48:20,327 --> 01:48:21,428
Deal.

2564
01:48:23,956 --> 01:48:26,650
Come on! There you go.

2565
01:48:26,709 --> 01:48:28,026
Whoo!

2566
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:31,522
<i>We had, literally,
a fuckload of money.</i>

2567
01:48:31,922 --> 01:48:34,024
<i>Aunt Emma could never
carry all this by herself.</i>

2568
01:48:34,758 --> 01:48:38,533
<i>So I thought to myself,
who else has a European passport?</i>

2569
01:48:38,595 --> 01:48:40,596
Brad, you're making this
too fucking tight!

2570
01:48:40,597 --> 01:48:43,474
<i>Now Brad, as a
successful drug dealer,</i>

2571
01:48:43,475 --> 01:48:45,768
<i>spent his winters in
the south of France,</i>

2572
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:47,895
<i>which is where he met
his wife, Chantalle,</i>

2573
01:48:47,896 --> 01:48:50,875
<i>a stripper of Slovenian origin</i>

2574
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:52,463
<i>born, in of all places,</i>

2575
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:54,545
<i>Switzerland.</i>

2576
01:48:58,615 --> 01:49:00,388
Well, this is fucked.

2577
01:49:00,784 --> 01:49:02,511
Oh. No shit.

2578
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:09,018
Like, this will take
her like 50 trips.

2579
01:49:09,043 --> 01:49:10,269
I know.

2580
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:15,073
Let me ask you something?

2581
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:17,759
What about her family? Right?

2582
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,511
I mean, they all got
Swiss passports, fight

2583
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:22,472
She's got parents,
she's got a brother, right?

2584
01:49:22,473 --> 01:49:24,474
The brother's got a wife.
That's five fucking people.

2585
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:26,476
Six, seven trips, boom, right?

2586
01:49:26,477 --> 01:49:28,144
They're all fucking
Swiss nitwits like her.

2587
01:49:28,145 --> 01:49:29,479
- They'll do it.
- We could do that.

2588
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:32,023
At least I have a family,
you crooked-nose fuck!

2589
01:49:32,024 --> 01:49:34,968
Hey, uh, don't forget
about my money.

2590
01:49:36,653 --> 01:49:37,820
I'm sorry, what's that?

2591
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:39,363
Yeah, I forgot to tell you.
He's got some...

2592
01:49:39,364 --> 01:49:41,512
- He's got some money.
- My money.

2593
01:49:41,784 --> 01:49:44,077
I got a couple of mil
coming in like a week.

2594
01:49:44,078 --> 01:49:46,772
When it gets in, I'll give you
a call, you come pick it up.

2595
01:49:49,291 --> 01:49:50,813
You give me a call?

2596
01:49:52,336 --> 01:49:55,671
When it gets here, I'll give you a
call and you'll come pick it up.

2597
01:49:55,672 --> 01:49:57,445
Well, we don't fucking
work for you, man!

2598
01:49:57,466 --> 01:49:58,988
Sweetheart,

2599
01:49:59,134 --> 01:50:01,052
you have my money
taped to your tits.

2600
01:50:01,053 --> 01:50:03,155
Okay? Technically,
you do work for me.

2601
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,793
Hey, Jordan,
we're gonna need to talk.

2602
01:50:07,935 --> 01:50:09,519
If I fucking do this,
I'm telling you right now,

2603
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,561
I ain't going to him, okay.

2604
01:50:10,562 --> 01:50:11,687
- I'm not a fucking <i>shvartze.</i>
- I got it.

2605
01:50:11,688 --> 01:50:13,064
I don't do fucking
pickups, all right?

2606
01:50:13,065 --> 01:50:14,190
- I got it.
- Well, listen to me.

2607
01:50:14,191 --> 01:50:15,858
We meet someplace
that I fucking say.

2608
01:50:15,859 --> 01:50:17,318
And you tell that
fucking piece of shit,

2609
01:50:17,319 --> 01:50:18,569
- he comes correct.
- I will.

2610
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:20,947
He comes in all fucking loopy
and fucked up, I swear to God

2611
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:22,865
I'll mash that
douchebag's teeth in.

2612
01:50:22,866 --> 01:50:24,700
You're gonna mash
whose fucking teeth in?

2613
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:26,494
Whose fucking teeth
are you gonna mash in?

2614
01:50:26,495 --> 01:50:28,871
I put the money on that
fucking table! Not you!

2615
01:50:28,872 --> 01:50:30,790
I'm the reason
we have this whole fucking deal!

2616
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:32,875
- He's got a gun, you fucking idiot!
- Fuck his gun!

2617
01:50:32,876 --> 01:50:34,168
I put that money in there!

2618
01:50:34,169 --> 01:50:35,795
You know what?
You're a fucking pill dealer.

2619
01:50:35,796 --> 01:50:38,172
I got five more just like you, bro.

2620
01:50:38,173 --> 01:50:39,966
Keep talking,
you fucking piece of shit!

2621
01:50:39,967 --> 01:50:41,801
You know what else?
You dress like shit!

2622
01:50:41,802 --> 01:50:42,885
So fuck you!

2623
01:50:42,886 --> 01:50:44,720
- Fucking motherfucker!
- Oh! Jesus!

2624
01:50:44,721 --> 01:50:46,823
How about that, faggot?
Who's a faggot?

2625
01:50:47,057 --> 01:50:48,659
You okay? Hey, pal.

2626
01:50:51,186 --> 01:50:54,063
<i>The next day,
Aunt Emma flew to Geneva.</i>

2627
01:50:54,064 --> 01:50:56,482
<i>Two million in cash
in her carry-on,</i>

2628
01:50:56,483 --> 01:50:57,900
<i>which in the big picture</i>

2629
01:50:57,901 --> 01:50:59,628
<i>was a drop in the Swiss bucket.</i>

2630
01:51:00,696 --> 01:51:02,071
<i>'Cause the following month,</i>

2631
01:51:02,072 --> 01:51:04,031
<i>over the course of six round trips,</i>

2632
01:51:04,032 --> 01:51:05,741
<i>Chantalle's family and friends</i>

2633
01:51:05,742 --> 01:51:08,161
<i>smuggled in over 20 million in cash</i>

2634
01:51:08,162 --> 01:51:10,014
<i>without even a hiccup.</i>

2635
01:51:14,918 --> 01:51:16,919
- And I have some more.
- Really?

2636
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,212
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

2637
01:51:18,213 --> 01:51:19,422
<i>And here.</i>

2638
01:51:19,423 --> 01:51:20,715
Welcome.

2639
01:51:20,716 --> 01:51:21,883
<i>Welcome.</i>

2640
01:51:21,884 --> 01:51:24,177
- Yeah, like four bags of it.
- Ooh!

2641
01:51:25,387 --> 01:51:27,805
Are you Swiss-Slovakian
or Swiss-Slovenian?

2642
01:51:27,806 --> 01:51:29,432
- Slovenian.
- Slovenian?

2643
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:30,808
Who cares. You're blonde.

2644
01:51:30,809 --> 01:51:31,910
Oh, stop.

2645
01:51:52,581 --> 01:51:53,789
Shit.

2646
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:57,023
Just put the fucking car in
park, you dumb fucking idiot!

2647
01:51:58,462 --> 01:52:00,171
I can't close this briefcase.

2648
01:52:00,172 --> 01:52:01,631
One fucking day.

2649
01:52:01,632 --> 01:52:03,674
One fucking day,
you couldn't keep it together?

2650
01:52:03,675 --> 01:52:05,368
I'm fucked up, Brad.

2651
01:52:05,802 --> 01:52:08,530
- Gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Fucked up.

2652
01:52:13,268 --> 01:52:14,852
- It's a joke.
- It's a joke?

2653
01:52:14,853 --> 01:52:16,896
- I'm sober.
- Jesus fucking Christ!

2654
01:52:16,897 --> 01:52:17,980
It's a fucking joke.

2655
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:19,649
- Are you fucking stupid?
- I'm not stupid.

2656
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,192
You fucking drive in here
like a fucking maniac,

2657
01:52:21,193 --> 01:52:23,110
you know the attention that
that fucking draws?

2658
01:52:23,111 --> 01:52:25,863
- I'm not stupid. I'm smart.
- Smart?

2659
01:52:25,864 --> 01:52:28,032
- I make million-dollar deals.
- That right?

2660
01:52:28,033 --> 01:52:30,493
With smart important
people, unlike you.

2661
01:52:30,494 --> 01:52:32,870
People who don't
sucker-punch people

2662
01:52:32,871 --> 01:52:34,455
when they're scared. Okay?

2663
01:52:34,456 --> 01:52:35,915
- I'm scared, huh?
- And by the way,

2664
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:36,999
I haven't gotten an
apology yet for that.

2665
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,125
You want an apology, okay.

2666
01:52:38,126 --> 01:52:39,669
I check my fucking
messages every day

2667
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:40,753
- when I come home from work.
- Did you?

2668
01:52:40,754 --> 01:52:42,004
- My answering machine. Zero.
- Didn't get one, huh?

2669
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:43,130
I got a blinking light,

2670
01:52:43,131 --> 01:52:44,507
because I don't have shit from you.

2671
01:52:44,508 --> 01:52:45,800
You know what,
you got a big fucking mouth, okay?

2672
01:52:45,801 --> 01:52:47,134
I got my wife checking the messages

2673
01:52:47,135 --> 01:52:49,220
every 45 minutes
calling the office, saying,

2674
01:52:49,221 --> 01:52:50,513
"Has Brad apologized yet?

2675
01:52:50,514 --> 01:52:52,598
"Is there an apology message
on the machine?"

2676
01:52:52,599 --> 01:52:54,225
I don't have jack shit.
You know what?

2677
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:55,726
That's not how you treat people.

2678
01:52:55,727 --> 01:52:56,852
You got a big fucking
mouth, you know.

2679
01:52:56,853 --> 01:52:58,604
I'm gonna give you a fucking pass.
Just give me the case.

2680
01:52:58,605 --> 01:53:00,898
You're gonna give me a pass?

2681
01:53:00,899 --> 01:53:02,566
Look, it's a figure
of fucking speech.

2682
01:53:02,567 --> 01:53:04,610
Oh, my gosh.
The Emperor of Fucksville

2683
01:53:04,611 --> 01:53:05,987
came down from Fucksville
to give me a pass!

2684
01:53:05,988 --> 01:53:07,071
From Fucksville, huh?

2685
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:09,031
Hey, what are the citizens
of Fucksville doing today

2686
01:53:09,032 --> 01:53:10,574
when their Emperor's gone?

2687
01:53:10,575 --> 01:53:12,201
Is it mayhem?

2688
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:14,078
Are people looting and raping?

2689
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:16,163
What are all the little fuckheads
doing while you're here?

2690
01:53:16,164 --> 01:53:17,665
Go fuck yourself! Give me the bag.

2691
01:53:17,666 --> 01:53:19,041
You back the fuck up.

2692
01:53:19,042 --> 01:53:20,293
I'll cause the biggest
fucking scene

2693
01:53:20,294 --> 01:53:22,586
that I've ever caused in my life

2694
01:53:22,587 --> 01:53:24,422
if you come at me again.

2695
01:53:24,423 --> 01:53:26,090
- You know what?
- Just fucking keep it down.

2696
01:53:26,091 --> 01:53:27,383
I got...

2697
01:53:27,384 --> 01:53:28,968
I don't wanna be out
of line or anything,

2698
01:53:28,969 --> 01:53:32,054
but I think you like,
like me. Like you...

2699
01:53:32,055 --> 01:53:33,597
Like when you come at me...

2700
01:53:33,598 --> 01:53:34,765
What's the matter with you?
What the fuck is...

2701
01:53:34,766 --> 01:53:36,267
and you look at me.
I swear I just noticed it.

2702
01:53:36,268 --> 01:53:38,060
You have like a fucking, like...

2703
01:53:38,061 --> 01:53:40,146
Like a twinkle.
You have like a twinkle.

2704
01:53:40,147 --> 01:53:41,689
Are you trying to kiss me, bro?

2705
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:43,357
Jesus fucking Christ.

2706
01:53:43,358 --> 01:53:45,401
- What's with you?
- I have a... I don't know.

2707
01:53:45,402 --> 01:53:47,194
- It's not a homophobic thing.
- All right...

2708
01:53:47,195 --> 01:53:48,988
You're just not the
one for me, pal.

2709
01:53:48,989 --> 01:53:50,197
You know what I mean? It's not...

2710
01:53:50,198 --> 01:53:52,199
- it's not about that for me, you know.
- I've heard enough.

2711
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:54,702
Please, I'm begging,
give me the fucking case.

2712
01:53:54,703 --> 01:53:56,162
- I'm gonna give you the case.
- Give me the case.

2713
01:53:56,163 --> 01:53:57,621
- You gotta do me one favor.
- What's that?

2714
01:53:57,622 --> 01:53:59,373
You gotta take this case,

2715
01:53:59,374 --> 01:54:01,000
you gotta drive straight home,

2716
01:54:01,001 --> 01:54:02,668
need you to open up the briefcase,

2717
01:54:02,669 --> 01:54:04,587
and you take out
every single dollar.

2718
01:54:04,588 --> 01:54:06,630
Don't leave one dollar
inside the briefcase.

2719
01:54:06,631 --> 01:54:07,840
And once you have it all

2720
01:54:07,841 --> 01:54:09,717
neatly organized
outside the briefcase,

2721
01:54:09,718 --> 01:54:12,094
I need you to take it
and I need you to shove it right up

2722
01:54:12,095 --> 01:54:14,263
your wife's Latvian
cunt, you understand?

2723
01:54:14,264 --> 01:54:16,015
- My fucking wife!
- Chill! Chill, bro.

2724
01:54:16,016 --> 01:54:17,558
Fuck. You motherfucking
piece of shit!

2725
01:54:17,559 --> 01:54:18,768
How about now?

2726
01:54:18,769 --> 01:54:20,227
- Go, go!
- Fuck!

2727
01:54:21,897 --> 01:54:23,689
Motherfuck! You're fucking dead!

2728
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:25,441
Stop! Don't move! Don't move!

2729
01:54:25,442 --> 01:54:28,386
Stop, or I will blow
you the fuck away!

2730
01:54:28,695 --> 01:54:30,946
Drop the case! Put
your hands in the air!

2731
01:54:30,947 --> 01:54:32,865
Get down.

2732
01:54:32,866 --> 01:54:34,718
Get down on your knees!
Get down on your knees!

2733
01:54:35,327 --> 01:54:36,849
Motherfucker!

2734
01:54:38,789 --> 01:54:39,936
Motherfucker!

2735
01:54:48,632 --> 01:54:52,301
Jordan, do I have a
surprise for you!

2736
01:54:52,302 --> 01:54:53,511
What's that?

2737
01:54:53,512 --> 01:54:55,137
Twenty real Lemmons.

2738
01:54:55,138 --> 01:54:56,389
Retired pharmacist's
client of mine,

2739
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,640
they've been in the
safe for 15 years.

2740
01:54:57,641 --> 01:54:59,141
Are you fucking kidding me?
Lemmons?

2741
01:54:59,142 --> 01:55:00,351
Ha-ha!

2742
01:55:00,352 --> 01:55:02,311
They're gonna knock us
on our fucking heads.

2743
01:55:02,312 --> 01:55:04,105
<i>When it comes to Quaaludes,</i>

2744
01:55:04,106 --> 01:55:07,316
<i>the Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail.</i>

2745
01:55:07,317 --> 01:55:08,901
- Can you believe it?
- Oh, my God.

2746
01:55:08,902 --> 01:55:10,444
I thought they were like a myth.

2747
01:55:10,445 --> 01:55:12,405
<i>Three times as powerful
as anything available today.</i>

2748
01:55:12,406 --> 01:55:13,531
Look at these babies.

2749
01:55:13,532 --> 01:55:16,200
<i>Boy, Donnie really knew
how to celebrate.</i>

2750
01:55:16,201 --> 01:55:18,369
<i>He said he was saving these
for a special occasion.</i>

2751
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:21,038
<i>Like a birthday, or
being clap free,</i>

2752
01:55:21,039 --> 01:55:24,109
<i>or our money arriving safely
in Switzerland.</i>

2753
01:55:27,421 --> 01:55:28,754
<i>So that night,</i>

2754
01:55:28,755 --> 01:55:30,673
<i>I cleared my schedule
and I rid my body</i>

2755
01:55:30,674 --> 01:55:33,277
<i>of anything that
could fuck with my high.</i>

2756
01:55:33,885 --> 01:55:35,783
<i>It was celebration time.</i>

2757
01:55:36,263 --> 01:55:37,513
Okay.

2758
01:55:37,514 --> 01:55:39,098
Start off with one,
see how it goes?

2759
01:55:39,099 --> 01:55:40,933
My guy says all we'll need is one.

2760
01:55:40,934 --> 01:55:42,456
Here you go.

2761
01:55:43,061 --> 01:55:44,812
- Salud!
- Cheers.

2762
01:55:44,813 --> 01:55:47,712
<i>Maybe if I pull it
again, it'll go down.</i>

2763
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:50,693
<i>Steve! Steve!</i>

2764
01:55:50,694 --> 01:55:52,027
<i>I gotta get out of here!</i>

2765
01:55:52,028 --> 01:55:53,988
<i>Carl, I think I got it figured out.</i>

2766
01:55:53,989 --> 01:55:57,783
<i>It must be one pull for up
and two pulls for down.</i>

2767
01:55:57,784 --> 01:55:59,136
<i>Okay.</i>

2768
01:56:07,377 --> 01:56:09,275
Do you feel anything?

2769
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,112
No.

2770
01:56:15,719 --> 01:56:17,636
It's been 35 minutes.

2771
01:56:17,637 --> 01:56:18,863
Hmm.

2772
01:56:20,056 --> 01:56:21,557
Maybe we've built up a tolerance

2773
01:56:21,558 --> 01:56:23,706
after all these years, huh?

2774
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:26,746
Hmm.

2775
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:38,240
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

2776
01:56:38,241 --> 01:56:41,494
My metabolism's pumping.
I can't feel shit!

2777
01:56:41,495 --> 01:56:42,745
They're old.

2778
01:56:42,746 --> 01:56:44,997
You think they lost
their potency, huh?

2779
01:56:44,998 --> 01:56:46,725
Check the bottle!

2780
01:56:49,461 --> 01:56:50,961
January '81.

2781
01:56:50,962 --> 01:56:52,129
They're fucking duds.

2782
01:56:52,130 --> 01:56:53,255
Fuck!

2783
01:56:53,256 --> 01:56:54,423
Let's take, uh...

2784
01:56:54,424 --> 01:56:56,026
Let's take two more each.

2785
01:56:57,886 --> 01:57:00,535
- Jordan.
- Yeah, baby.

2786
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:05,893
What are you two retards doing?

2787
01:57:05,894 --> 01:57:07,211
We're working out, honey.

2788
01:57:07,437 --> 01:57:09,104
Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.

2789
01:57:09,105 --> 01:57:10,189
Okay.

2790
01:57:10,190 --> 01:57:12,213
- Okay?
- Okay

2791
01:57:13,610 --> 01:57:15,236
Hey, Bo, what's going on?

2792
01:57:15,237 --> 01:57:16,445
Jordan, listen to me clearly.

2793
01:57:16,446 --> 01:57:17,905
I cannot talk to you on this phone,

2794
01:57:17,906 --> 01:57:19,114
I have to talk to you.

2795
01:57:19,115 --> 01:57:20,699
<i>Get out of here.
What's going on?</i>

2796
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:24,119
Listen to me!
Leave the fucking house, Jordan,

2797
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,871
and then call me from a pay phone.

2798
01:57:25,872 --> 01:57:27,915
This is not a fucking joke, Jordan.

2799
01:57:27,916 --> 01:57:29,643
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2800
01:57:30,043 --> 01:57:31,460
- Shit.
- What'd he say?

2801
01:57:31,461 --> 01:57:32,920
I don't know what the
fuck's going on.

2802
01:57:32,921 --> 01:57:34,989
- I gotta go!
- Is everything okay, Jordan?

2803
01:57:45,308 --> 01:57:47,142
<i>The closest pay
phone I could get to</i>

2804
01:57:47,143 --> 01:57:49,541
<i>was at the Brookville Country Club.</i>

2805
01:57:50,105 --> 01:57:52,147
<i>It was a real WASP stronghold,</i>

2806
01:57:52,148 --> 01:57:54,842
<i>just a mile down the road
from my house.</i>

2807
01:58:04,202 --> 01:58:05,703
Hey, Bo, what's up, it's me.
What's going on?

2808
01:58:05,704 --> 01:58:06,829
I'm at a pay phone.
What's going on?

2809
01:58:06,830 --> 01:58:08,038
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>

2810
01:58:08,039 --> 01:58:09,915
Please. Your little
friend there, Brad,

2811
01:58:09,916 --> 01:58:11,893
your little buddy, he's in jail.

2812
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:13,836
What the fuck's he in jail for?

2813
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:15,379
<i>- What'd he do?
- I don't know what he did.</i>

2814
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:16,797
My friends in Long Island told me

2815
01:58:16,798 --> 01:58:19,091
he got picked up
in some fucking shopping mall.

2816
01:58:19,092 --> 01:58:20,175
He got locked up by...

2817
01:58:20,176 --> 01:58:22,511
Wait, wait. Did you...
Did you say a shopping mall?

2818
01:58:22,512 --> 01:58:23,887
- Yeah.
- He was with Donnie.

2819
01:58:23,888 --> 01:58:25,472
He was supposed
to deliver some money,

2820
01:58:25,473 --> 01:58:26,974
- then that fucking fat piece of shit...
<i>- Listen to me!</i>

2821
01:58:26,975 --> 01:58:28,017
I gotta go fucking
talk to him right now!

2822
01:58:28,018 --> 01:58:30,060
Listen to me! Don't go!
Listen to me.

2823
01:58:30,061 --> 01:58:32,771
That guy Denham,
that FBI agent guy,

2824
01:58:32,772 --> 01:58:35,149
somebody told me he's got
your phones tapped.

2825
01:58:35,150 --> 01:58:36,734
Your office and your home.

2826
01:58:36,735 --> 01:58:38,527
<i>Don't talk on the
motherfucking phone!</i>

2827
01:58:38,528 --> 01:58:40,551
Okay. Fuck! I got it.
I got it. I got it.

2828
01:58:40,905 --> 01:58:42,131
<i>Jordan.</i>

2829
01:58:42,574 --> 01:58:46,452
You didn't try to bribe this
fucking FBI agent, did you?

2830
01:58:46,453 --> 01:58:48,579
No, I didn't try to
bribe an FBI agent.

2831
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:50,205
You think I'm that fucking stupid?
No.

2832
01:58:50,206 --> 01:58:52,166
<i>What the fuck did you say?
I can't understand you.</i>

2833
01:58:52,167 --> 01:58:53,417
<i>Say that again.</i>

2834
01:58:53,418 --> 01:58:56,317
I said...

2835
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,297
<i>What the fuck are you saying?</i>

2836
01:58:59,382 --> 01:59:00,466
I said...

2837
01:59:00,467 --> 01:59:02,009
<i>Are you fucking high?</i>

2838
01:59:04,554 --> 01:59:07,282
<i>Jordan, are you fucking high?</i>

2839
01:59:08,016 --> 01:59:10,225
<i>Jordan, do me a favor,
stay where you are.</i>

2840
01:59:10,226 --> 01:59:11,935
<i>Don't get behind the
wheel of the car.</i>

2841
01:59:11,936 --> 01:59:13,562
<i>I'm gonna send Rocco over
to pick you up.</i>

2842
01:59:13,563 --> 01:59:14,897
<i>Jordan! Jordan!</i>

2843
01:59:14,898 --> 01:59:17,232
<i>After 15 years in storage,</i>

2844
01:59:17,233 --> 01:59:20,277
<i>the Lemmons had developed
a delayed fuse.</i>

2845
01:59:20,278 --> 01:59:23,030
<i>It took 90 minutes for these
little fuckers to kick in.</i>

2846
01:59:23,031 --> 01:59:24,448
<i>But once they did...</i>

2847
01:59:24,449 --> 01:59:25,949
<i>Pow!</i>

2848
01:59:25,950 --> 01:59:27,576
<i>I mean, I had skipped
the tingle phase</i>

2849
01:59:27,577 --> 01:59:29,578
<i>and went straight
to the drool phase.</i>

2850
01:59:29,579 --> 01:59:31,622
<i>Tell me where you are!
Don't fucking drive...</i>

2851
01:59:31,623 --> 01:59:33,624
<i>These little bastards
were so strong,</i>

2852
01:59:33,625 --> 01:59:35,751
<i>I discovered a whole new phase.</i>

2853
01:59:35,752 --> 01:59:37,900
<i>The cerebral palsy phase.</i>

2854
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:42,192
<i>Come on, stand up!</i>

2855
01:59:46,054 --> 01:59:48,077
<i>Okay, walking's out.</i>

2856
01:59:48,932 --> 01:59:51,911
<i>All right, think, think.
What else is there?</i>

2857
01:59:52,644 --> 01:59:56,465
<i>Yes! I can crawl.
I can crawl like Skylar!</i>

2858
02:00:28,012 --> 02:00:31,082
<i>Fuck! The kid makes it
look so goddamn easy!</i>

2859
02:00:38,022 --> 02:00:40,482
<i>Think, you motherfucker, think!</i>

2860
02:00:40,483 --> 02:00:41,900
<i>Yes!</i>

2861
02:00:41,901 --> 02:00:44,095
<i>I got it! I've got it!</i>

2862
02:00:44,404 --> 02:00:46,677
<i>I can roll! I can roll!</i>

2863
02:01:34,746 --> 02:01:35,972
Ah!

2864
02:01:54,224 --> 02:01:55,416
Ah!

2865
02:02:08,905 --> 02:02:10,239
Jordan.

2866
02:02:11,741 --> 02:02:13,184
<i>Jordan.</i>

2867
02:02:13,451 --> 02:02:15,202
<i>Oh, Jesus. Where are you?</i>

2868
02:02:15,203 --> 02:02:16,745
I'm at a country club!

2869
02:02:16,746 --> 02:02:17,871
<i>What?</i>

2870
02:02:17,872 --> 02:02:20,791
I'm at a country club!

2871
02:02:20,792 --> 02:02:22,209
<i>I don't know what the
fuck you're saying.</i>

2872
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:23,544
<i>Look, you need to get home.</i>

2873
02:02:23,545 --> 02:02:26,255
<i>Donnie is out of control!
He's on the other line</i>

2874
02:02:26,256 --> 02:02:28,215
<i>with some Swiss guy.
I don't know...</i>

2875
02:02:28,216 --> 02:02:29,299
What?

2876
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:32,370
Get him off the phone!

2877
02:02:32,595 --> 02:02:35,430
<i>I can't understand you!</i>

2878
02:02:35,431 --> 02:02:36,765
Get him

2879
02:02:36,766 --> 02:02:37,891
off

2880
02:02:37,892 --> 02:02:39,101
the phone!

2881
02:02:39,102 --> 02:02:40,435
<i>I don't know what the fuck
you're saying, Jordan.</i>

2882
02:02:40,436 --> 02:02:41,854
<i>Can you just get home? Hurry!</i>

2883
02:02:51,614 --> 02:02:53,824
<i>I was less than a mile from home.</i>

2884
02:02:53,825 --> 02:02:56,618
<i>I drove as slow as I fucking could.</i>

2885
02:02:56,619 --> 02:02:58,704
<i>I'd seen Jell-O move faster.</i>

2886
02:02:58,705 --> 02:03:01,228
<i>I was gonna give you 2 million.</i>

2887
02:03:01,291 --> 02:03:03,940
I's gonna be lates.

2888
02:03:04,502 --> 02:03:06,195
You ate 2 million?

2889
02:03:07,005 --> 02:03:08,338
Later.

2890
02:03:08,339 --> 02:03:09,548
<i>Get off the phone.</i>

2891
02:03:09,549 --> 02:03:11,133
<i>Get off the fucking phone! Idiot!</i>

2892
02:03:12,427 --> 02:03:14,621
Get out of the way, asshole!

2893
02:03:17,181 --> 02:03:18,515
You hate 2 million?

2894
02:03:18,516 --> 02:03:20,118
No, you don't hate
2 million, Donnie.

2895
02:03:22,562 --> 02:03:25,522
<i>By some miracle,
I made it home alive,</i>

2896
02:03:25,523 --> 02:03:27,921
<i>not a scratch on me or the car.</i>

2897
02:03:37,243 --> 02:03:38,827
Jordan?

2898
02:03:38,828 --> 02:03:41,496
Jesus fucking Christ!

2899
02:03:41,497 --> 02:03:43,081
What did you take?

2900
02:03:43,082 --> 02:03:44,458
What's wrong with you?

2901
02:03:44,459 --> 02:03:45,542
Jor!

2902
02:03:45,543 --> 02:03:48,003
It's fucking good, right?

2903
02:03:48,004 --> 02:03:49,379
Fucked up!

2904
02:03:50,673 --> 02:03:52,616
Get off the phone!

2905
02:03:55,553 --> 02:03:57,846
What the fuck, Jordan?

2906
02:03:57,847 --> 02:03:59,514
Your daughter's in the house!

2907
02:03:59,515 --> 02:04:00,682
I hope you know that!

2908
02:04:00,683 --> 02:04:02,059
Your fucking daughter's
in the house!

2909
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:04,061
Yeah, it's real fucking
funny, Donnie.

2910
02:04:04,062 --> 02:04:06,521
Get off the phone!

2911
02:04:07,649 --> 02:04:08,690
Jesus Christ, Jordan.

2912
02:04:08,691 --> 02:04:10,464
The FBI!

2913
02:04:11,694 --> 02:04:13,046
Hey!

2914
02:04:13,488 --> 02:04:15,465
I'm on phone!

2915
02:04:15,573 --> 02:04:18,051
Get off the fucking phone!

2916
02:04:19,702 --> 02:04:21,804
- Come here!
- ...the phone.

2917
02:04:23,790 --> 02:04:27,019
Come on.
We're gonna go upstairs, all right.

2918
02:04:28,878 --> 02:04:30,070
Ow!

2919
02:04:31,798 --> 02:04:33,382
I'm on the phone!

2920
02:04:33,383 --> 02:04:34,800
On the phone!

2921
02:04:34,801 --> 02:04:36,995
I know what you did,

2922
02:04:37,387 --> 02:04:38,887
you piece of shit!

2923
02:04:38,888 --> 02:04:40,681
What? What?

2924
02:04:40,682 --> 02:04:42,125
Brad!

2925
02:04:42,475 --> 02:04:43,725
Huh?

2926
02:04:43,726 --> 02:04:45,294
Brad!

2927
02:04:45,687 --> 02:04:46,979
Brad!

2928
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:49,503
You fucking cocksucker!

2929
02:04:53,736 --> 02:04:55,696
What did you do,

2930
02:04:55,697 --> 02:04:57,572
you piece of shit?

2931
02:04:57,573 --> 02:04:59,095
Fuck you!

2932
02:05:00,243 --> 02:05:02,619
I wanna fucking kill you!

2933
02:05:02,620 --> 02:05:04,893
I wanna fucking kill you!

2934
02:05:05,748 --> 02:05:07,191
I got you!

2935
02:05:31,649 --> 02:05:33,672
What the fuck happened?

2936
02:05:34,027 --> 02:05:35,360
Oh, shit!

2937
02:05:35,361 --> 02:05:37,338
Jordan? Jordan, are you all right?

2938
02:05:37,405 --> 02:05:39,098
Donnie? Donnie?

2939
02:05:39,323 --> 02:05:40,490
Donnie?

2940
02:05:40,491 --> 02:05:41,908
Jordan, he's not breathing.

2941
02:05:41,909 --> 02:05:43,785
Oh, fuck, I don't know what to do.

2942
02:05:43,786 --> 02:05:45,120
Jordan, I don't know
what the fuck to do!

2943
02:05:45,121 --> 02:05:46,768
I can't help him!
Oh, my God. Jordan.

2944
02:05:48,499 --> 02:05:51,126
Oh, my God, I think he's choking,
Jordan. Do something.

2945
02:05:51,127 --> 02:05:52,979
- Oh, God.
- Baby, I got you!

2946
02:05:53,463 --> 02:05:56,442
He's not breathing, Jordan.
You gotta do something!

2947
02:05:57,258 --> 02:05:59,656
Shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

2948
02:05:59,969 --> 02:06:01,470
<i>Ah!</i>

2949
02:06:01,471 --> 02:06:02,888
I got you.

2950
02:06:19,697 --> 02:06:20,798
Oh!

2951
02:06:22,158 --> 02:06:23,851
Step aside!

2952
02:06:23,993 --> 02:06:25,470
Oh, God!

2953
02:06:25,828 --> 02:06:27,396
Oh, God!

2954
02:06:27,663 --> 02:06:29,515
Move aside, baby.

2955
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:38,256
Come on! Come on!

2956
02:06:38,257 --> 02:06:39,574
Come on!

2957
02:06:44,013 --> 02:06:46,787
Jordan, he's not breathing.
You gotta do something.

2958
02:06:47,725 --> 02:06:49,851
Jordan, he's a father!
He's got fucking kids!

2959
02:06:49,852 --> 02:06:51,625
- Do something!
- Yeah?

2960
02:06:57,193 --> 02:06:58,360
Rocco, you gotta get over here.

2961
02:06:58,361 --> 02:07:00,362
- Come on.
- Call an ambulance!

2962
02:07:00,363 --> 02:07:01,613
I don't fucking know!

2963
02:07:01,614 --> 02:07:03,406
Just get over here! Call 911.

2964
02:07:11,415 --> 02:07:12,516
Yeah.

2965
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:16,404
You all right? He's all right.

2966
02:07:29,517 --> 02:07:31,711
Mr. Belfort?

2967
02:07:32,562 --> 02:07:34,130
Mr. Belfort?

2968
02:07:36,691 --> 02:07:39,693
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Fuck.

2969
02:07:39,694 --> 02:07:42,297
Sir, we need to ask
you some questions.

2970
02:07:42,864 --> 02:07:44,906
Are you fucking kidding me?
Fuck you.

2971
02:07:44,907 --> 02:07:46,074
Come on, get up.

2972
02:07:46,075 --> 02:07:47,768
Get the fuck out of my house.

2973
02:07:49,453 --> 02:07:51,246
- Let's go.
- I've been here all night.

2974
02:07:51,247 --> 02:07:52,831
I been sitting here all night.

2975
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:54,291
What the fuck are
you talking about?

2976
02:07:54,292 --> 02:07:56,334
- Where you taking him?
- Where you taking me?

2977
02:07:56,335 --> 02:07:57,502
Where you taking him?

2978
02:07:57,503 --> 02:07:58,587
You ain't got no warrant.

2979
02:07:58,588 --> 02:08:00,228
Just come up in people's
house like that!

2980
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:03,425
Did you drive your car tonight,
Mr. Belfort?

2981
02:08:03,426 --> 02:08:04,698
Huh?

2982
02:08:04,927 --> 02:08:06,119
Well?

2983
02:08:09,265 --> 02:08:10,787
<i>Wow!</i>

2984
02:08:10,975 --> 02:08:12,873
<i>Maybe I hadn't made it home okay.</i>

2985
02:08:27,909 --> 02:08:30,387
Get out of the fucking way!

2986
02:08:32,246 --> 02:08:33,598
Fuck!

2987
02:08:39,128 --> 02:08:41,129
Did you drive

2988
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:42,857
that car tonight?

2989
02:08:43,883 --> 02:08:46,092
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right.

2990
02:08:46,093 --> 02:08:47,969
I'm a family man!

2991
02:08:47,970 --> 02:08:49,804
Family man. Honey!

2992
02:08:49,805 --> 02:08:51,806
<i>It was a miracle I wasn't killed,</i>

2993
02:08:51,807 --> 02:08:54,935
<i>or that I didn't kill anybody else.</i>

2994
02:08:54,936 --> 02:08:56,686
<i>The cops took me in
for questioning,</i>

2995
02:08:56,687 --> 02:08:58,146
<i>but they couldn't charge me.</i>

2996
02:08:58,147 --> 02:09:00,690
<i>They had no proof
I was even behind the wheel.</i>

2997
02:09:00,691 --> 02:09:01,816
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

2998
02:09:01,817 --> 02:09:03,985
<i>Brad did three months
in jail for contempt</i>

2999
02:09:03,986 --> 02:09:06,655
<i>because he wouldn't rat Donnie out.</i>

3000
02:09:06,656 --> 02:09:07,781
<i>The result,</i>

3001
02:09:07,782 --> 02:09:09,491
<i>I was soot-free.</i>

3002
02:09:09,492 --> 02:09:11,952
<i>But I had eyes on me
like never before.</i>

3003
02:09:11,953 --> 02:09:13,662
You're a lucky man, Jordan.

3004
02:09:13,663 --> 02:09:16,665
You're lucky to be alive,
let alone not in jail.

3005
02:09:16,666 --> 02:09:18,333
You know I don't believe
in luck, right?

3006
02:09:18,334 --> 02:09:19,793
But it's time.

3007
02:09:19,794 --> 02:09:22,128
Please, let me call the SEC
and cut a deal

3008
02:09:22,129 --> 02:09:24,130
before your luck runs out.

3009
02:09:24,131 --> 02:09:25,799
Wave to Daddy.

3010
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:26,967
Hey.

3011
02:09:26,968 --> 02:09:28,570
Hey, sweetie.

3012
02:09:33,683 --> 02:09:37,018
What kind of terms would you
be talking about if I...

3013
02:09:37,019 --> 02:09:38,353
I don't know.

3014
02:09:38,354 --> 02:09:41,398
You plead guilty to a handful
of securities violations,

3015
02:09:41,399 --> 02:09:44,526
stock manipulation,
high-pressure sales tactics.

3016
02:09:44,527 --> 02:09:47,362
Ticky-tack shit like
that, you know.

3017
02:09:47,363 --> 02:09:49,447
You pay a couple million
dollars in fines,

3018
02:09:49,448 --> 02:09:52,472
in exchange, the SEC fucks
off till the end of time.

3019
02:09:54,745 --> 02:09:56,472
And Stratton?

3020
02:09:56,872 --> 02:09:58,832
What happens to Stratton?

3021
02:09:58,833 --> 02:10:01,710
There's no way... I mean...
You got to walk away. Right?

3022
02:10:01,711 --> 02:10:02,961
Let Donnie be in charge.

3023
02:10:02,962 --> 02:10:04,655
Right. Donnie.

3024
02:10:05,298 --> 02:10:07,549
Now the FBI is
another animal completely.

3025
02:10:07,550 --> 02:10:09,384
They'll still be pursuing you
for criminal wrongdoing.

3026
02:10:09,385 --> 02:10:12,220
However, with you stepping
down voluntarily,

3027
02:10:12,221 --> 02:10:14,264
my guess is that
your best friend Agent Denham

3028
02:10:14,265 --> 02:10:16,709
will be standing around
with his dick in his hand.

3029
02:10:17,727 --> 02:10:19,060
Jordan.

3030
02:10:19,061 --> 02:10:21,104
What do you have to think about?

3031
02:10:21,105 --> 02:10:22,731
You beat them.

3032
02:10:22,732 --> 02:10:23,982
You won!

3033
02:10:23,983 --> 02:10:25,692
God knows you never
have to work again.

3034
02:10:25,693 --> 02:10:27,736
What're you gonna do?
Spend the rest of your life in jail?

3035
02:10:27,737 --> 02:10:28,903
- Is that what you want?
- No.

3036
02:10:28,904 --> 02:10:30,071
- Of course not.
- Okay.

3037
02:10:30,072 --> 02:10:32,198
Okay! You got all the
money in the world.

3038
02:10:32,199 --> 02:10:33,867
You need everybody else's money?

3039
02:10:33,868 --> 02:10:35,368
- Of course not, Pops.
- Well?

3040
02:10:35,369 --> 02:10:37,746
- You know, I built it.
- I know you built it.

3041
02:10:37,747 --> 02:10:39,599
You built it, so now preserve it.

3042
02:11:10,738 --> 02:11:12,215
You know,

3043
02:11:12,531 --> 02:11:15,325
five years ago, when I
started Stratton Oakmont

3044
02:11:15,326 --> 02:11:17,452
with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day

3045
02:11:17,453 --> 02:11:20,898
would eventually come
where I'd have to be moving on.

3046
02:11:22,750 --> 02:11:24,376
And it's truly with a heavy heart

3047
02:11:24,377 --> 02:11:26,650
that I'm here to say that...

3048
02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:30,507
That that day is finally here.

3049
02:11:34,553 --> 02:11:36,930
I wanna...
I want to thank you all for your...

3050
02:11:36,931 --> 02:11:39,682
Your years of loyalty
and admiration.

3051
02:11:39,683 --> 02:11:41,285
But the point is this.

3052
02:11:42,144 --> 02:11:43,478
Under Donnie's leadership,

3053
02:11:43,479 --> 02:11:47,023
along with Nicky Koskoff
and Robbie Feinberg

3054
02:11:47,024 --> 02:11:49,943
moving into key management
positions, this place really

3055
02:11:49,944 --> 02:11:51,319
is gonna be better than ever!

3056
02:11:51,320 --> 02:11:53,593
That I promise you. Okay?

3057
02:11:53,823 --> 02:11:56,426
Give them a round of applause.
Come on.

3058
02:11:59,453 --> 02:12:02,247
This is Ellis Island here, people.

3059
02:12:02,248 --> 02:12:03,998
I don't care who you are,
where you're from,

3060
02:12:03,999 --> 02:12:06,626
whether your relatives came
over on the fucking Mayflower

3061
02:12:06,627 --> 02:12:08,837
or on an inner tube from Haiti,

3062
02:12:08,838 --> 02:12:11,172
this right here is the
land of opportunity.

3063
02:12:11,173 --> 02:12:13,776
Stratton Oakmont is America!

3064
02:12:17,721 --> 02:12:19,472
All of you know
Kimmie Belzer, right?

3065
02:12:19,473 --> 02:12:20,723
Yes, we do.

3066
02:12:20,724 --> 02:12:21,933
Fuck you.

3067
02:12:21,934 --> 02:12:23,852
Come on, Kimmie.

3068
02:12:23,853 --> 02:12:25,437
What you probably didn't know is,

3069
02:12:25,438 --> 02:12:27,355
Kimmie was one of
the first brokers here,

3070
02:12:27,356 --> 02:12:29,709
one of Stratton's original 20.

3071
02:12:30,359 --> 02:12:32,318
Now most of you met Kimmie,

3072
02:12:32,319 --> 02:12:35,423
the beautiful sophisticated woman
that she is today.

3073
02:12:35,698 --> 02:12:38,927
A woman that wears
$3,000 Armani suits.

3074
02:12:40,786 --> 02:12:43,480
Who drives a brand-new
Mercedes-Benz.

3075
02:12:44,039 --> 02:12:45,957
A woman who spends

3076
02:12:45,958 --> 02:12:47,500
her winters in the Bahamas

3077
02:12:47,501 --> 02:12:49,695
and summers in the Hamptons!

3078
02:12:54,592 --> 02:12:57,036
That's not the Kimmie that I met.

3079
02:12:59,763 --> 02:13:03,663
The Kimmie that I met didn't have
two nickels to rub together.

3080
02:13:04,768 --> 02:13:07,103
She was a single mom
on the balls of her ass

3081
02:13:07,104 --> 02:13:09,022
with an 8-year-old son.

3082
02:13:09,023 --> 02:13:12,127
Okay? She was
three months behind on her rent.

3083
02:13:13,068 --> 02:13:16,863
And when she came to me
and asked me for a job,

3084
02:13:16,864 --> 02:13:19,115
she asked for a $5,000 advance

3085
02:13:19,116 --> 02:13:22,390
just so she could pay
her son's tuition.

3086
02:13:26,749 --> 02:13:28,583
And what'd I do, Kimmie?

3087
02:13:28,584 --> 02:13:30,357
Go on, tell them.

3088
02:13:32,046 --> 02:13:34,194
You wrote me a check

3089
02:13:34,298 --> 02:13:36,526
for $25,000.

3090
02:13:37,718 --> 02:13:39,240
That's right.

3091
02:13:39,261 --> 02:13:40,704
Thank you.

3092
02:13:44,016 --> 02:13:45,868
And you know why that is?

3093
02:13:49,104 --> 02:13:51,548
It's because I believed in you.

3094
02:13:53,108 --> 02:13:55,927
It's because I believed
in you, Kimmie,

3095
02:13:56,278 --> 02:13:58,112
just like I believe in each

3096
02:13:58,113 --> 02:14:00,240
and every one of you here today.

3097
02:14:00,241 --> 02:14:02,700
- I fucking love you, Jordan!
- I fucking love you.

3098
02:14:02,701 --> 02:14:04,619
I fucking love you! I love you.

3099
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:07,519
I fucking love you, too!
I fucking love you, too!

3100
02:14:10,292 --> 02:14:12,394
And I love all of you!

3101
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:15,296
And I love all of you
from the bottom of my heart.

3102
02:14:15,297 --> 02:14:17,900
- I fucking love you, too.
- I mean that.

3103
02:14:18,634 --> 02:14:20,987
You are the shit.
You are the fucking shit.

3104
02:14:27,393 --> 02:14:29,666
It's a shame, you know.

3105
02:14:31,146 --> 02:14:33,231
For years, I've been
telling you guys

3106
02:14:33,232 --> 02:14:35,358
never to take no for
an answer, right?

3107
02:14:35,359 --> 02:14:38,679
You know, to keep pushing,
to never hang up the phone

3108
02:14:39,488 --> 02:14:41,841
until you get what you want.

3109
02:14:42,658 --> 02:14:44,476
Because you all deserve it.

3110
02:14:46,412 --> 02:14:49,732
You know, this fucking deal
that I'm about to sign

3111
02:14:50,124 --> 02:14:52,333
barring me from the
securities industry,

3112
02:14:52,334 --> 02:14:54,436
barring me from Stratton,

3113
02:14:55,421 --> 02:14:56,943
my home.

3114
02:14:59,633 --> 02:15:01,735
What the fuck is that, you know?

3115
02:15:02,845 --> 02:15:05,289
I'll tell you what it is. It's...

3116
02:15:05,889 --> 02:15:08,788
It's me taking no for an answer,
you know.

3117
02:15:10,185 --> 02:15:11,519
It's them...

3118
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:14,874
It's them selling me,
not the other way around.

3119
02:15:15,524 --> 02:15:18,343
It's me being a hypocrite
is what it is.

3120
02:15:23,407 --> 02:15:24,804
So...

3121
02:15:31,790 --> 02:15:33,483
You know what?

3122
02:15:37,171 --> 02:15:38,838
I'm not leaving.

3123
02:15:41,091 --> 02:15:42,488
I'm not leaving.

3124
02:15:45,304 --> 02:15:46,554
I'm not fucking leaving!

3125
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:54,038
You're not getting
a fucking promotion!

3126
02:15:55,314 --> 02:15:56,791
The show goes on!

3127
02:15:59,276 --> 02:16:00,777
This is my home!

3128
02:16:00,778 --> 02:16:03,613
They're gonna need
a fucking wrecking ball

3129
02:16:03,614 --> 02:16:05,637
to take me out of here!

3130
02:16:07,534 --> 02:16:10,078
They're gonna need to
send in the National Guard

3131
02:16:10,079 --> 02:16:11,913
or fucking SWAT team

3132
02:16:11,914 --> 02:16:14,517
'cause I ain't going nowhere!

3133
02:16:17,252 --> 02:16:18,353
Fuck them!

3134
02:16:20,756 --> 02:16:22,654
Fuck them!

3135
02:16:56,625 --> 02:16:58,543
Jordy! Jordy!

3136
02:16:58,544 --> 02:17:00,646
Jordy! Get back here!

3137
02:17:01,422 --> 02:17:02,648
Hey!

3138
02:17:05,008 --> 02:17:06,342
Give me that.

3139
02:17:08,804 --> 02:17:09,971
What is this?

3140
02:17:09,972 --> 02:17:12,575
<i>Ramar of the Jungle,
for Christ sake?</i>

3141
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:16,602
<i>Paddy D, mazel tov, you Irishman.</i>

3142
02:17:16,603 --> 02:17:20,148
<i>Jordan Belfort just welched
on his deal with the SEC.</i>

3143
02:17:20,149 --> 02:17:22,923
<i>He is back in the ocean.
Happy hunting.</i>

3144
02:17:35,706 --> 02:17:38,082
<i>It was our time to party big.</i>

3145
02:17:38,083 --> 02:17:40,811
<i>And just as Brad
was released from jail, too.</i>

3146
02:17:41,545 --> 02:17:43,921
<i>I apologized, even
offered to pay him</i>

3147
02:17:43,922 --> 02:17:45,615
<i>for his time in the can.</i>

3148
02:17:46,133 --> 02:17:48,301
<i>But he said no, that he was out.</i>

3149
02:17:48,302 --> 02:17:50,219
<i>He didn't want any part of us.</i>

3150
02:17:50,220 --> 02:17:51,929
<i>Sad thing was,</i>

3151
02:17:51,930 --> 02:17:53,514
<i>two years later</i>

3152
02:17:53,515 --> 02:17:55,288
<i>he was dead.</i>

3153
02:17:55,350 --> 02:17:57,828
<i>Massive heart attack. Thirty-five.</i>

3154
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:00,980
<i>Same age Mozart died.</i>

3155
02:18:00,981 --> 02:18:04,317
<i>Not that they have a hell
of a lot in common, but...</i>

3156
02:18:04,318 --> 02:18:06,716
<i>Anyway, I don't know
why that came to mind.</i>

3157
02:18:08,781 --> 02:18:10,031
<i>Within days,</i>

3158
02:18:10,032 --> 02:18:12,492
<i>subpoenas started flying.</i>

3159
02:18:12,493 --> 02:18:15,870
<i>Notices to produce documents,
depositions, you name it.</i>

3160
02:18:15,871 --> 02:18:17,997
<i>Donnie couldn't drink
water fast enough.</i>

3161
02:18:17,998 --> 02:18:20,541
United States government
wants to give me a subpoena?

3162
02:18:20,542 --> 02:18:23,942
Here's what we do with
subpoenas at Stratton Oakmont!

3163
02:18:29,551 --> 02:18:32,261
Fuck you, USA! Fuck you!

3164
02:18:32,262 --> 02:18:34,222
Fuck you! Fuck you!

3165
02:18:34,223 --> 02:18:36,826
Fuck you!

3166
02:18:41,980 --> 02:18:43,332
Oh!

3167
02:18:43,774 --> 02:18:45,817
Jordan Belfort.

3168
02:18:45,818 --> 02:18:47,902
Alden. That's a nice name.

3169
02:18:47,903 --> 02:18:49,237
Thank you very much for that.

3170
02:18:49,238 --> 02:18:51,531
- What kind of name is that?
- That is my name.

3171
02:18:51,532 --> 02:18:53,241
I do not recall that.

3172
02:18:53,242 --> 02:18:55,701
I do not recall that. Okay?

3173
02:18:55,702 --> 02:18:57,912
Mr. Ming,
thank you for coming in today.

3174
02:18:57,913 --> 02:18:59,622
Are you gonna finish
the rest of that Danish?

3175
02:18:59,623 --> 02:19:00,915
- Can I have that Danish?
- No, no, go ahead.

3176
02:19:00,916 --> 02:19:02,708
<i>They interrogated everybody.</i>

3177
02:19:02,709 --> 02:19:04,418
I got a low blood sugar,
thyroid thing.

3178
02:19:04,419 --> 02:19:05,628
<i>It went on for months.</i>

3179
02:19:05,629 --> 02:19:07,755
<i>It was a total fucking harassment.</i>

3180
02:19:07,756 --> 02:19:09,423
Tell him to proceed
with the questions.

3181
02:19:09,424 --> 02:19:11,926
<i>But not a single
Strattonite cracked.</i>

3182
02:19:11,927 --> 02:19:13,678
Gladys Carrera?

3183
02:19:13,679 --> 02:19:15,304
Doesn't ring a bell.

3184
02:19:15,305 --> 02:19:18,033
Sorry, I have no
recommendation of that.

3185
02:19:18,100 --> 02:19:19,183
No.

3186
02:19:19,184 --> 02:19:20,268
No idea.

3187
02:19:20,269 --> 02:19:22,854
I don't recall that transaction.
You guys have any milk?

3188
02:19:22,855 --> 02:19:25,231
Absolutely not.

3189
02:19:25,232 --> 02:19:27,108
Francis Sortigi
you called so many times

3190
02:19:27,109 --> 02:19:29,443
I just thought you
might remember that.

3191
02:19:29,444 --> 02:19:30,987
<i>Would you remember any of those?</i>

3192
02:19:30,988 --> 02:19:32,822
- I do not recall any of that.
- This Abdul...

3193
02:19:32,823 --> 02:19:35,116
I do not... No, I don't recall.

3194
02:19:35,117 --> 02:19:36,826
It was a long phone call.

3195
02:19:36,827 --> 02:19:38,619
I just wondered
if you have any memory of that.

3196
02:19:38,620 --> 02:19:40,454
Okay. You know we've
talked to several

3197
02:19:40,455 --> 02:19:41,831
of the employees at this firm

3198
02:19:41,832 --> 02:19:43,124
and nobody can recall anything

3199
02:19:43,125 --> 02:19:45,251
about this Steve Madden IPO.

3200
02:19:45,252 --> 02:19:46,569
I think it's Odd.

3201
02:19:48,338 --> 02:19:49,630
Do you recall

3202
02:19:49,631 --> 02:19:50,923
Cartage Corporation?

3203
02:19:50,924 --> 02:19:52,341
Mmm.

3204
02:19:52,342 --> 02:19:53,676
You do recall it?

3205
02:19:53,677 --> 02:19:55,074
No, I don't recall that at all.

3206
02:19:55,554 --> 02:19:58,578
Excuse me. I have to ask.
Is that your real hair?

3207
02:19:59,141 --> 02:20:01,309
Are you gonna say
anything about that?

3208
02:20:01,310 --> 02:20:02,685
Are you gonna comment on my hair?

3209
02:20:02,686 --> 02:20:04,478
Is that how we're doing...
Is this personal questions?

3210
02:20:04,479 --> 02:20:06,272
I'm just wondering why you would
wear something like that.

3211
02:20:06,273 --> 02:20:08,216
Sorry. I don't recall that company.

3212
02:20:10,152 --> 02:20:11,986
Can I get you anything
else, gentlemen?

3213
02:20:11,987 --> 02:20:13,905
Yes. Sweetheart,
I have a rare condition

3214
02:20:13,906 --> 02:20:15,323
which requires me to
drink one of those

3215
02:20:15,324 --> 02:20:17,426
every 15 minutes, please.

3216
02:20:17,826 --> 02:20:20,995
<i>We were specifically advised
not to leave the country.</i>

3217
02:20:20,996 --> 02:20:23,144
<i>So, we took our wives to Italy.</i>

3218
02:20:23,457 --> 02:20:25,917
<i>We figured we were safer
working from overseas</i>

3219
02:20:25,918 --> 02:20:27,376
<i>giving orders to Rugrat.</i>

3220
02:20:27,377 --> 02:20:29,670
<i>Nobody could arrest us
and nobody could prove</i>

3221
02:20:29,671 --> 02:20:31,714
<i>I was still running
Stratton from a yacht.</i>

3222
02:20:31,715 --> 02:20:33,049
Hey, Rugrat.

3223
02:20:33,050 --> 02:20:34,342
- Oh!
<i>- Bonjour.</i>

3224
02:20:34,343 --> 02:20:36,385
You bald-headed eagle,
how you doing?

3225
02:20:36,386 --> 02:20:37,470
<i>Donnie, Donnie, listen!</i>

3226
02:20:37,471 --> 02:20:38,846
We have a problem, okay.

3227
02:20:38,847 --> 02:20:42,183
Your friend, Steve Madden,
is unloading shares.

3228
02:20:42,184 --> 02:20:44,310
What are you saying?
Who told you that?

3229
02:20:44,311 --> 02:20:45,937
<i>- What's going on?
- He's doing it, Donnie!</i>

3230
02:20:45,938 --> 02:20:48,522
He said that
Steve Madden's unloading shares.

3231
02:20:48,523 --> 02:20:49,844
Who told you that? It's bullshit!

3232
02:20:50,192 --> 02:20:52,044
Give me that goddamn phone.

3233
02:20:52,110 --> 02:20:53,803
What's going on?

3234
02:20:53,862 --> 02:20:56,030
Jordan, look.
I'm watching the screen

3235
02:20:56,031 --> 02:20:58,866
and huge chunks of Steve Madden
are being sold, okay.

3236
02:20:58,867 --> 02:21:00,952
It's not coming from us,
so it's gotta be Steve.

3237
02:21:00,953 --> 02:21:03,079
He's the only person
with that many shares.

3238
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:04,163
It's Donnie.
Call me back, all right.

3239
02:21:04,164 --> 02:21:05,247
Donnie, your little friend

3240
02:21:05,248 --> 02:21:06,582
is trying to fuck
me, you know that.

3241
02:21:06,583 --> 02:21:08,376
Your little friend is trying to
fuck me right in the ass.

3242
02:21:08,377 --> 02:21:10,044
- Get him on the phone now!
- We don't know anything yet.

3243
02:21:10,045 --> 02:21:11,522
Let's not jump to conclusions.

3244
02:21:11,922 --> 02:21:13,714
<i>Even though I owned 85%</i>

3245
02:21:13,715 --> 02:21:16,884
<i>of Steve-cocksucking-
motherfucking-Madden Shoes,</i>

3246
02:21:16,885 --> 02:21:19,220
<i>the shares were in
his fucking name.</i>

3247
02:21:19,221 --> 02:21:21,514
<i>This motherfucker knew
I was in trouble with the feds</i>

3248
02:21:21,515 --> 02:21:23,391
<i>and was trying to take advantage.</i>

3249
02:21:23,392 --> 02:21:24,934
Talk to me, man.
How do you wanna play this?

3250
02:21:24,935 --> 02:21:26,769
I want you to get all our clients
on the phone right now

3251
02:21:26,770 --> 02:21:28,187
and have them start
selling Steve Madden.

3252
02:21:28,188 --> 02:21:29,730
We're gonna drive
that fucking price down!

3253
02:21:29,731 --> 02:21:31,565
Do you hear me? Shut the fuck up!

3254
02:21:31,566 --> 02:21:33,109
This is your fucking friend
from high school.

3255
02:21:33,110 --> 02:21:35,277
<i>If that little fucking prick thinks
he can fuck with me,</i>

3256
02:21:35,278 --> 02:21:37,947
we'll turn his company
into a penny stock! You hear me?

3257
02:21:37,948 --> 02:21:39,448
- You got it?
- Yes. I got it!

3258
02:21:39,449 --> 02:21:40,992
<i>Let's just not
jump to conclusions</i>

3259
02:21:40,993 --> 02:21:42,451
<i>before we know what's going on.</i>

3260
02:21:42,452 --> 02:21:43,911
Captain Ted!

3261
02:21:43,912 --> 02:21:45,104
Captain Ted!

3262
02:21:45,497 --> 02:21:47,957
Hang up your phones!
Everybody, hey!

3263
02:21:47,958 --> 02:21:50,857
Turn the boat around!
We're going home!

3264
02:21:53,839 --> 02:21:56,362
Baby! Baby, what happened?

3265
02:21:56,508 --> 02:21:57,860
I just...

3266
02:21:58,176 --> 02:21:59,528
Sweetheart, what's going on?

3267
02:22:00,595 --> 02:22:02,288
Aunt Emma...

3268
02:22:03,098 --> 02:22:04,495
Just wait.

3269
02:22:04,766 --> 02:22:06,475
I can't...

3270
02:22:06,476 --> 02:22:09,437
What's going on? Why you crying?

3271
02:22:09,438 --> 02:22:11,605
- She's dead!
- Who? Who's dead?

3272
02:22:11,606 --> 02:22:14,066
I just got a call
from my cousin Betty.

3273
02:22:14,067 --> 02:22:15,234
Yeah?

3274
02:22:15,235 --> 02:22:17,053
Aunt Emma is dead.

3275
02:22:18,321 --> 02:22:21,140
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No.

3276
02:22:21,408 --> 02:22:22,634
You're serious?

3277
02:22:23,326 --> 02:22:25,745
Oh, my God! Baby, that's...

3278
02:22:25,746 --> 02:22:27,288
Oh, fuck!

3279
02:22:27,289 --> 02:22:29,123
Oh, sweetheart, that's just...

3280
02:22:29,124 --> 02:22:30,541
<i>Fucking heart attack!</i>

3281
02:22:30,542 --> 02:22:32,209
<i>Boom, snap, gone.</i>

3282
02:22:32,210 --> 02:22:34,128
<i>Shuffled off her mortal coil.</i>

3283
02:22:34,129 --> 02:22:37,590
<i>And $20 million stuck
in a Swiss bank account.</i>

3284
02:22:37,591 --> 02:22:39,759
The last time I talked to her
she was fine!

3285
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:41,969
- She's not that old.
- Oh, God! Baby, oh, God!

3286
02:22:41,970 --> 02:22:44,221
That's so fucking terrible!

3287
02:22:44,222 --> 02:22:46,015
Oh, fuck!

3288
02:22:46,016 --> 02:22:47,141
It is terrible.

3289
02:22:47,142 --> 02:22:49,727
Your aunt was such an elegant,
attractive woman.

3290
02:22:49,728 --> 02:22:51,562
My condolences to you
and your family.

3291
02:22:51,563 --> 02:22:53,147
Yes. We're absolutely devastated.

3292
02:22:53,148 --> 02:22:55,274
Thank you so much
for your condolences.

3293
02:22:55,275 --> 02:22:56,567
Now where does that leave us

3294
02:22:56,568 --> 02:22:58,235
in regard to her account exactly?

3295
02:22:58,236 --> 02:22:59,820
Does it go into probate or what?

3296
02:22:59,821 --> 02:23:01,489
Not to worry, Jordan. Not to worry.

3297
02:23:01,490 --> 02:23:03,282
Your aunt, before she died,

3298
02:23:03,283 --> 02:23:06,262
signed a document naming you
as her successor.

3299
02:23:06,453 --> 02:23:07,995
She did?

3300
02:23:07,996 --> 02:23:09,769
Fantastic! Well, that's good news!

3301
02:23:09,956 --> 02:23:12,229
Well, not as of yet.

3302
02:23:12,417 --> 02:23:14,502
What does that mean? Not as of yet?

3303
02:23:16,838 --> 02:23:18,672
I can't seem to hear you.

3304
02:23:18,673 --> 02:23:21,447
I must have bad reception.
Are you speaking English?

3305
02:23:21,510 --> 02:23:24,303
- Very... Now. Fast. Very fast.
<i>- Fast?</i>

3306
02:23:24,304 --> 02:23:26,472
I have to get to Switzerland now?

3307
02:23:28,100 --> 02:23:30,267
Speak English!
Fucking speak English!

3308
02:23:30,268 --> 02:23:31,685
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey.
Hey! Quiet, okay?

3309
02:23:31,686 --> 02:23:33,187
Take your suit,
take your dick, okay,

3310
02:23:33,188 --> 02:23:34,980
- and move your ass! Please.
- Okay.

3311
02:23:34,981 --> 02:23:37,066
Move my ass! Yes!

3312
02:23:37,067 --> 02:23:41,278
<i>I gotta say, these Swiss were
some sneaky motherfuckers.</i>

3313
02:23:41,279 --> 02:23:43,322
<i>Within minutes,
he had me set up with a forger</i>

3314
02:23:43,323 --> 02:23:45,366
<i>who could fake Aunt
Emma's signature.</i>

3315
02:23:45,367 --> 02:23:47,014
You American shit!

3316
02:23:47,077 --> 02:23:48,911
<i>I just had to get
there by tomorrow,</i>

3317
02:23:48,912 --> 02:23:50,538
<i>or lose $20 million.</i>

3318
02:23:50,539 --> 02:23:52,357
We're going to Monaco!

3319
02:23:52,833 --> 02:23:55,209
- Monaco? Now?
- Yes, baby.

3320
02:23:55,210 --> 02:23:57,878
We're going to Monaco, so then
we can go to Switzerland, okay?

3321
02:23:57,879 --> 02:23:59,652
- But her aunt just died.
- I realize that.

3322
02:23:59,673 --> 02:24:00,923
But I have business in Switzerland.

3323
02:24:00,924 --> 02:24:02,633
I need to go to
Switzerland right now.

3324
02:24:02,634 --> 02:24:04,828
Bottom line. Sorry.

3325
02:24:05,053 --> 02:24:06,905
We gotta get to London.

3326
02:24:07,347 --> 02:24:08,664
Why? Why?

3327
02:24:10,058 --> 02:24:11,350
The funeral!

3328
02:24:11,351 --> 02:24:12,794
Yeah, but babe. Look, look...

3329
02:24:13,145 --> 02:24:15,980
I loved your aunt more than
anyone in the entire world.

3330
02:24:15,981 --> 02:24:17,628
I really did.

3331
02:24:18,024 --> 02:24:20,317
But she's dead now, sweetie.

3332
02:24:20,318 --> 02:24:22,611
She's dead
and she's not going anywhere.

3333
02:24:22,612 --> 02:24:23,904
She'll still be dead by the time

3334
02:24:23,905 --> 02:24:25,131
we get to London, okay?

3335
02:24:25,657 --> 02:24:27,491
Captain Ted! Captain
Ted, all right, look.

3336
02:24:27,492 --> 02:24:29,410
We're going to Monaco.
Monaco now, okay?

3337
02:24:29,411 --> 02:24:30,494
Monaco, right.

3338
02:24:30,495 --> 02:24:32,454
We're going to Monaco
so that we can drive to Switzerland

3339
02:24:32,455 --> 02:24:33,873
so they don't stamp our passports.

3340
02:24:33,874 --> 02:24:35,791
Take care of business here,
we'll drive back to Monaco,

3341
02:24:35,792 --> 02:24:37,585
take a flight over to London
to catch the funeral

3342
02:24:37,586 --> 02:24:39,128
and be in New York
in three fucking business days!

3343
02:24:39,129 --> 02:24:40,421
That's the fucking plan.

3344
02:24:40,422 --> 02:24:42,882
I just want you to know
that we might run into some chop.

3345
02:24:42,883 --> 02:24:45,134
Chop?
We can fucking handle chop, right?

3346
02:24:45,135 --> 02:24:46,635
I mean, it's a 170-foot yacht.

3347
02:24:46,636 --> 02:24:48,053
No, no, no. We're
not going anywhere

3348
02:24:48,054 --> 02:24:49,430
unless he says it's
safe, all right.

3349
02:24:49,431 --> 02:24:50,973
- Don't worry about the chop.
- It's safe.

3350
02:24:50,974 --> 02:24:52,433
You don't know shit about chop.

3351
02:24:52,434 --> 02:24:54,685
Oh, really? And you do?
You're a fucking expert on that.

3352
02:24:54,686 --> 02:24:57,104
I'll chop your fucking credit
card in half. How about that?

3353
02:24:57,105 --> 02:24:59,106
Chop is fine. Trust me.
Chop is fine.

3354
02:24:59,107 --> 02:25:00,858
Is chop fine, Captain Ted?

3355
02:25:00,859 --> 02:25:02,109
Uh...

3356
02:25:02,110 --> 02:25:04,069
Yeah. I mean, if we take it slow.

3357
02:25:04,070 --> 02:25:05,279
Yeah, we're gonna take it slow.

3358
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:06,947
It's a little uncomfortable.
Tell them it's safe.

3359
02:25:06,948 --> 02:25:08,240
It's gonna be safe.

3360
02:25:08,241 --> 02:25:10,451
We'll batten down the hatches

3361
02:25:10,452 --> 02:25:11,911
and secure the deck.

3362
02:25:11,912 --> 02:25:15,456
And we're looking at a few...
Maybe a few broken dishes.

3363
02:25:15,457 --> 02:25:16,916
Few broken dishes.

3364
02:25:16,917 --> 02:25:18,167
What's a few broken dishes?

3365
02:25:18,168 --> 02:25:19,543
Does that sound fucking
awesome or what?

3366
02:25:19,544 --> 02:25:21,003
No. Not really.

3367
02:25:21,004 --> 02:25:22,379
We're gonna have a
fucking good time!

3368
02:25:22,380 --> 02:25:24,215
Let's go to fucking Monaco now!

3369
02:25:24,216 --> 02:25:25,408
Let's fucking move! Let's go!

3370
02:25:30,805 --> 02:25:31,952
Hold On!

3371
02:25:35,018 --> 02:25:38,145
What the fuck is going on out here?

3372
02:25:38,146 --> 02:25:40,814
The Jet Skis just went overboard!

3373
02:25:40,815 --> 02:25:42,942
Oh, Jesus Christ! Honey, you okay?

3374
02:25:42,943 --> 02:25:45,152
<i>Gale warning! Gale warning!</i>

3375
02:25:45,153 --> 02:25:47,988
The waves are
20 feet high and building!

3376
02:25:47,989 --> 02:25:49,782
Turn around, let's go
the other fucking way.

3377
02:25:49,783 --> 02:25:51,033
- We can't!
- Go!

3378
02:25:51,034 --> 02:25:53,702
We'll get broad-sided.
It'll tip over!

3379
02:25:53,703 --> 02:25:55,621
I am a master diver. You hear that?

3380
02:25:55,622 --> 02:25:56,705
I'm a master diver!

3381
02:25:56,706 --> 02:25:58,040
No one's gonna fucking die!

3382
02:25:58,041 --> 02:26:00,751
I got you, baby. I got you.
Trust me, okay?

3383
02:26:00,752 --> 02:26:02,127
I love you.

3384
02:26:02,128 --> 02:26:04,129
I love you, baby.
Just hold on tight.

3385
02:26:04,130 --> 02:26:05,214
Okay.

3386
02:26:05,215 --> 02:26:06,362
Donnie!

3387
02:26:07,842 --> 02:26:09,176
Hold on, baby!

3388
02:26:09,177 --> 02:26:10,278
Donnie!

3389
02:26:12,180 --> 02:26:13,327
Donnie!

3390
02:26:13,723 --> 02:26:15,182
- What?
- Hold on, baby.

3391
02:26:15,183 --> 02:26:16,809
Get the fucking ludes.

3392
02:26:16,810 --> 02:26:18,018
I don't wanna die, Jordan!

3393
02:26:18,019 --> 02:26:20,838
I did a lot of bad shit.
I'm going to hell, Jordan!

3394
02:26:20,855 --> 02:26:23,816
I fucked up! I fucked up so bad!

3395
02:26:23,817 --> 02:26:25,885
Get the ludes! Downstairs!

3396
02:26:26,027 --> 02:26:27,299
What are you saying?

3397
02:26:27,696 --> 02:26:29,264
Fuck!

3398
02:26:30,031 --> 02:26:31,282
Get the ludes!

3399
02:26:31,283 --> 02:26:32,992
I can't go down there, Jordan.
It's flooded.

3400
02:26:32,993 --> 02:26:34,326
It's three feet of
water down there!

3401
02:26:34,327 --> 02:26:37,162
I will not die sober!

3402
02:26:37,163 --> 02:26:38,998
Get those fucking ludes!

3403
02:26:38,999 --> 02:26:40,082
Okay!

3404
02:26:40,083 --> 02:26:41,526
- Go!
- Okay

3405
02:26:44,296 --> 02:26:46,130
- Where's he going?
- Hold on, baby!

3406
02:26:46,131 --> 02:26:47,840
Donnie! Is he fucking crazy?

3407
02:26:47,841 --> 02:26:49,281
He's just warning everybody!

3408
02:27:01,146 --> 02:27:02,998
Jesus Christ!

3409
02:27:04,441 --> 02:27:05,733
Hold on!

3410
02:27:05,734 --> 02:27:07,234
Get away from the window!

3411
02:27:07,235 --> 02:27:08,736
Rogue wave!

3412
02:27:08,737 --> 02:27:09,862
Mayday!

3413
02:27:09,863 --> 02:27:12,531
This is Captain Ted Beecham
aboard the yacht Naomi!

3414
02:27:12,532 --> 02:27:14,134
- We are going down!
- I got 'em!

3415
02:27:14,451 --> 02:27:15,803
I got 'em!

3416
02:27:16,870 --> 02:27:18,454
Give me one for the nerves!

3417
02:27:18,455 --> 02:27:19,705
We're going down!

3418
02:27:19,706 --> 02:27:21,957
This is a fucking Mayday!

3419
02:27:21,958 --> 02:27:24,186
We require immediate assistance!

3420
02:27:25,754 --> 02:27:27,379
Hold on!

3421
02:27:27,380 --> 02:27:28,481
Watch out!

3422
02:27:40,268 --> 02:27:42,917
<i>The nice thing about
getting rescued by Italians</i>

3423
02:27:43,104 --> 02:27:46,774
<i>is that they feed you,
make you drink red wine,</i>

3424
02:27:46,775 --> 02:27:48,843
<i>then you get to dance.</i>

3425
02:28:05,293 --> 02:28:07,066
<i>Did you see that?</i>

3426
02:28:07,379 --> 02:28:10,403
<i>That was the plane
I sent to come get us.</i>

3427
02:28:11,216 --> 02:28:12,883
<i>I shit you not, it exploded</i>

3428
02:28:12,884 --> 02:28:15,052
<i>when a seagull flew
into the engine.</i>

3429
02:28:15,053 --> 02:28:17,155
<i>Three people killed.</i>

3430
02:28:21,267 --> 02:28:23,143
<i>You want a sign from God?</i>

3431
02:28:23,144 --> 02:28:26,373
<i>Well, after all this,
I finally got the message.</i>

3432
02:28:31,694 --> 02:28:35,447
<i>Do you dream of becoming
financially independent</i>

3433
02:28:35,448 --> 02:28:38,158
but struggle every month
just to pay your bills?

3434
02:28:38,159 --> 02:28:40,119
Would you like to own
a home like this,

3435
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:42,329
but can barely afford
to pay your rent?

3436
02:28:42,330 --> 02:28:44,039
My name is Jordan Belfort,

3437
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:46,166
and there's no secret
to wealth creation.

3438
02:28:46,167 --> 02:28:47,501
No matter who you are,

3439
02:28:47,502 --> 02:28:48,836
no matter where you came from,

3440
02:28:48,837 --> 02:28:51,380
you too can become
financially independent

3441
02:28:51,381 --> 02:28:53,215
in just a matter of months.

3442
02:28:53,216 --> 02:28:55,467
All you need is a strategy.

3443
02:28:55,468 --> 02:28:57,177
When I was 24 years old,

3444
02:28:57,178 --> 02:29:01,056
I made a decision not just
to survive, but to thrive.

3445
02:29:01,057 --> 02:29:03,600
<i>At first I didn't feel like
deals like these were possible.</i>

3446
02:29:03,601 --> 02:29:07,146
But we have the house
and we have a $33,000 profit.

3447
02:29:07,147 --> 02:29:08,355
I certainly believe now.

3448
02:29:08,356 --> 02:29:09,857
Think about it for a second.

3449
02:29:09,858 --> 02:29:12,025
If you don't have the guts
to attend Jordan Belfort's

3450
02:29:12,026 --> 02:29:14,278
Straight Line Persuasion
System seminar,

3451
02:29:14,279 --> 02:29:15,946
then how do you expect
to make any money?

3452
02:29:15,947 --> 02:29:17,698
<i>If you want to be
a millionaire someday,</i>

3453
02:29:17,699 --> 02:29:19,783
<i>have some guts. Make a decision.</i>

3454
02:29:19,784 --> 02:29:21,118
Jordan Belfort's
setup worked for me

3455
02:29:21,119 --> 02:29:22,619
because I worked hard for it.

3456
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:24,163
And if it doesn't work for you,

3457
02:29:24,164 --> 02:29:25,247
it's because you're lazy.

3458
02:29:25,248 --> 02:29:26,540
And you should get a
job at McDonald's.

3459
02:29:26,541 --> 02:29:29,501
<i>There's nobody holding
you back from financial freedom.</i>

3460
02:29:29,502 --> 02:29:32,463
And there's nobody stopping
you from making millions.

3461
02:29:32,464 --> 02:29:33,797
Don't just sit at home,

3462
02:29:33,798 --> 02:29:36,526
or the life of your dreams
will sail right past you.

3463
02:29:39,220 --> 02:29:41,180
I changed all these people's lives

3464
02:29:41,181 --> 02:29:42,890
and I can change yours, too!

3465
02:29:42,891 --> 02:29:44,224
So come to my seminar!

3466
02:29:44,225 --> 02:29:45,726
The life of your dreams is only...

3467
02:29:45,727 --> 02:29:47,519
Good to see you again, Jordan.

3468
02:29:47,520 --> 02:29:48,645
You're under arrest!

3469
02:29:48,646 --> 02:29:50,339
You gotta be joking!

3470
02:29:51,524 --> 02:29:52,816
You're kidding me.

3471
02:29:52,817 --> 02:29:54,485
Hey, get the fuck away from me!

3472
02:29:54,486 --> 02:29:55,819
Turn that camera off.

3473
02:29:55,820 --> 02:29:57,905
I'm fucking shooting a
fucking infomercial here,

3474
02:29:57,906 --> 02:29:59,406
you fucking cocksucker!

3475
02:29:59,407 --> 02:30:01,158
- Fuck you, you motherfucker!
- Shut the fucking camera off.

3476
02:30:01,159 --> 02:30:03,035
You don't got shit
on me, you hear me!

3477
02:30:03,036 --> 02:30:04,161
Go fuck yourself!

3478
02:30:04,162 --> 02:30:06,622
I'm making an honest living,
you fucking piece of shit!

3479
02:30:06,623 --> 02:30:07,748
Hey, Jordan,

3480
02:30:07,749 --> 02:30:09,708
let me give you a
little legal advice.

3481
02:30:09,709 --> 02:30:11,210
Shut the fuck up!

3482
02:30:11,211 --> 02:30:12,794
Oh, fuck you, you fucking prick!

3483
02:30:12,795 --> 02:30:15,489
I'm making an honest living,
you motherfucker!

3484
02:30:17,175 --> 02:30:18,717
<i>I clean up my act.</i>

3485
02:30:18,718 --> 02:30:21,345
<i>I did rehab. I'm a TV personality.</i>

3486
02:30:21,346 --> 02:30:24,181
<i>I'm sober for two years.
And this happens!</i>

3487
02:30:24,182 --> 02:30:26,475
<i>Rugrat goes and gets busted
down in Miami.</i>

3488
02:30:26,476 --> 02:30:27,809
I'm Swiss, I'm not communist.

3489
02:30:27,810 --> 02:30:29,603
<i>And guess who
the fuck with? Saurel.</i>

3490
02:30:29,604 --> 02:30:30,729
- You gonna beat me?
- No, sir.

3491
02:30:30,730 --> 02:30:33,065
Yeah, I know your country.
You're gonna beat me.

3492
02:30:33,066 --> 02:30:34,858
<i>I mean, what are
the fucking odds?</i>

3493
02:30:34,859 --> 02:30:37,611
<i>There had to be 10,000
Swiss bankers in Geneva,</i>

3494
02:30:37,612 --> 02:30:39,279
<i>and Rugrat gets the
one dumb enough</i>

3495
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:41,448
<i>to get himself arrested
on U. S. soil.</i>

3496
02:30:41,449 --> 02:30:42,926
I know.

3497
02:30:42,951 --> 02:30:44,428
I'm so sorry.

3498
02:30:46,538 --> 02:30:47,829
<i>Even more fucked</i>

3499
02:30:47,830 --> 02:30:49,289
<i>- was that he got busted</i>

3500
02:30:49,290 --> 02:30:51,041
<i>for shit that had
nothing to do with me.</i>

3501
02:30:51,042 --> 02:30:52,709
<i>It had nothing to
fucking do with me.</i>

3502
02:30:52,710 --> 02:30:54,795
<i>Something about
laundering drug money</i>

3503
02:30:54,796 --> 02:30:57,965
<i>through offshore boat racing
and a guy named Rocky Aoki,</i>

3504
02:30:57,966 --> 02:31:00,133
<i>you know, the founder of Benihana.</i>

3505
02:31:00,134 --> 02:31:01,593
<i>Benihana.</i>

3506
02:31:01,594 --> 02:31:03,367
<i>Beni-fucking-hana!</i>

3507
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:05,514
<i>Beni-fucking-hana!</i>

3508
02:31:05,515 --> 02:31:06,598
<i>Why?</i>

3509
02:31:06,599 --> 02:31:08,016
<i>Why, why, God?</i>

3510
02:31:08,017 --> 02:31:09,601
<i>Why would you be so cruel</i>

3511
02:31:09,602 --> 02:31:12,229
<i>as to choose a chain
of fucking hibachi restaurants</i>

3512
02:31:12,230 --> 02:31:13,582
<i>to take me down?</i>

3513
02:31:15,900 --> 02:31:18,485
<i>Long story short.
Saurel rats me out.</i>

3514
02:31:18,486 --> 02:31:21,655
<i>But not before he rats out
Brad's wife, Chantalle,</i>

3515
02:31:21,656 --> 02:31:23,323
<i>who, it turns out,
he'd been fucking</i>

3516
02:31:23,324 --> 02:31:25,893
<i>every time she went to Switzerland!</i>

3517
02:31:27,745 --> 02:31:30,394
- No, no, no, it's impossible.
- Oui, oui, oui.

3518
02:31:32,500 --> 02:31:34,334
- All right!
- Ah!

3519
02:31:34,335 --> 02:31:36,169
<i>One count engaging in conspiracy</i>

3520
02:31:36,170 --> 02:31:37,921
<i>to commit securities fraud.</i>

3521
02:31:37,922 --> 02:31:40,215
<i>Two counts securities fraud.</i>

3522
02:31:40,216 --> 02:31:43,760
One count engaging in conspiracy
to commit money laundering.

3523
02:31:43,761 --> 02:31:46,096
Twenty-one counts money laundering.

3524
02:31:46,097 --> 02:31:48,620
One count obstruction of justice.

3525
02:31:49,517 --> 02:31:51,836
Bail is set at $10 million.

3526
02:32:06,993 --> 02:32:08,561
<i>Uncle Donnie's here!</i>

3527
02:32:09,370 --> 02:32:11,689
Rocky. How you doing?

3528
02:32:12,290 --> 02:32:14,666
Woof. I hate that fucking dog.

3529
02:32:14,667 --> 02:32:17,044
Yeah, he's getting
old and decrepit.

3530
02:32:17,045 --> 02:32:18,629
Starting to shit in
the house again.

3531
02:32:18,630 --> 02:32:20,422
- Me, too.
- Come here, buddy.

3532
02:32:20,423 --> 02:32:21,798
Ah, fuck.

3533
02:32:21,799 --> 02:32:23,550
- It's good to see you, pal.
- Yeah, you, too.

3534
02:32:23,551 --> 02:32:24,801
Good to see you.

3535
02:32:24,802 --> 02:32:27,451
Sit down. Oh, man.

3536
02:32:29,223 --> 02:32:30,575
How you doing, brother?

3537
02:32:31,309 --> 02:32:32,893
You know.

3538
02:32:32,894 --> 02:32:34,645
Shitty, pal.

3539
02:32:34,646 --> 02:32:36,874
But I'm hanging in there.

3540
02:32:38,107 --> 02:32:40,734
My new piece of jewelry.
Check that out.

3541
02:32:40,735 --> 02:32:43,195
Can't leave the house, you know?

3542
02:32:43,196 --> 02:32:45,845
Starting to get cabin
fever already.

3543
02:32:46,324 --> 02:32:48,017
Fucking Rugrat.

3544
02:32:48,451 --> 02:32:49,868
That wig-wearing faggot.

3545
02:32:49,869 --> 02:32:52,079
I can't believe that fucking guy.
I wanna kill him.

3546
02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:54,748
Swear to God,
I want to choke him to death.

3547
02:32:54,749 --> 02:32:57,084
Irresponsible little prick.

3548
02:32:58,211 --> 02:32:59,358
I'll tell you one thing.

3549
02:33:00,588 --> 02:33:03,191
I'm never eating at Benihana again.

3550
02:33:03,925 --> 02:33:06,198
I don't care whose birthday it is.

3551
02:33:07,512 --> 02:33:09,205
Where's Naomi? How's she doing?

3552
02:33:09,889 --> 02:33:11,264
That's her in the house there.

3553
02:33:11,265 --> 02:33:13,333
You could say hi, but she
probably won't wave back.

3554
02:33:13,434 --> 02:33:15,207
Naomi, sweetheart!

3555
02:33:18,564 --> 02:33:19,898
What's up her ass?

3556
02:33:19,899 --> 02:33:21,483
- Is she mad at me?
- No, you know...

3557
02:33:21,484 --> 02:33:23,068
We probably have to
mortgage the house

3558
02:33:23,069 --> 02:33:24,945
in order to make bail.

3559
02:33:24,946 --> 02:33:26,446
Probably end up selling the thing

3560
02:33:26,447 --> 02:33:28,699
in order to pay for
all the lawyers.

3561
02:33:28,700 --> 02:33:31,269
It's been a nightmare, buddy,
to tell you the truth.

3562
02:33:31,452 --> 02:33:33,225
What are you gonna do, right?

3563
02:33:33,955 --> 02:33:36,832
Anyway, how's Stratton?
That's more important.

3564
02:33:36,833 --> 02:33:37,999
How's morale?

3565
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,752
They all pissed off 'cause they
have to make money legally now?

3566
02:33:40,753 --> 02:33:42,275
- Jordan.
- Hmm?

3567
02:33:42,547 --> 02:33:45,090
I got the founding
partners together.

3568
02:33:45,091 --> 02:33:47,569
I talked to them about everything.

3569
02:33:48,219 --> 02:33:49,366
And I got you.

3570
02:33:50,096 --> 02:33:51,743
What do you mean, you got me?

3571
02:33:52,807 --> 02:33:55,626
The house, money, don't
worry about it. I got you.

3572
02:34:01,524 --> 02:34:02,691
All right.

3573
02:34:02,692 --> 02:34:03,775
I love you, buddy.

3574
02:34:03,776 --> 02:34:05,777
- You know I'd do it for you, right?
- I know.

3575
02:34:05,778 --> 02:34:07,846
- You know that, right?
- I know.

3576
02:34:08,698 --> 02:34:09,948
I could fucking kiss you all over.

3577
02:34:09,949 --> 02:34:11,158
All right, enough, enough.

3578
02:34:13,161 --> 02:34:14,411
You want a beer, pal?

3579
02:34:14,412 --> 02:34:15,704
What are you drinking?

3580
02:34:15,705 --> 02:34:17,873
I got this non-alcoholic shit.

3581
02:34:17,874 --> 02:34:19,166
What's that?

3582
02:34:19,167 --> 02:34:22,294
A non-alcoholic beer.
It's got no alcohol.

3583
02:34:22,295 --> 02:34:24,648
- It's a beer?
- Yeah, with no alcohol.

3584
02:34:25,131 --> 02:34:26,465
But if you drink enough,

3585
02:34:26,466 --> 02:34:28,467
if you drink a lot,
they get you fucked up?

3586
02:34:28,468 --> 02:34:30,635
No, there's no alcohol.
That's the fucking point.

3587
02:34:30,636 --> 02:34:31,762
I'm not a scientist.

3588
02:34:31,763 --> 02:34:33,013
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

3589
02:34:33,014 --> 02:34:34,681
I can get you a beer
if you want a fucking beer.

3590
02:34:34,682 --> 02:34:36,933
I know, but I don't drink.
You remember?

3591
02:34:36,934 --> 02:34:38,185
I don't drink anymore.

3592
02:34:38,186 --> 02:34:39,269
Oh, you wanna go inside

3593
02:34:39,270 --> 02:34:40,771
and blow some lines
of baking powder?

3594
02:34:40,772 --> 02:34:42,689
Or baking soda...

3595
02:34:42,690 --> 02:34:45,066
Can't imagine ever not
enjoying getting fucked up.

3596
02:34:45,067 --> 02:34:46,610
- Yeah.
- I love it.

3597
02:34:46,611 --> 02:34:48,195
How's being sober?

3598
02:34:48,196 --> 02:34:50,155
- Fucking sucks.
- Boring, right?

3599
02:34:50,156 --> 02:34:52,634
So boring. I wanna kill myself.

3600
02:34:53,075 --> 02:34:55,702
There's a term,
and we don't like to use it

3601
02:34:55,703 --> 02:34:57,245
unless circumstances dictate,

3602
02:34:57,246 --> 02:34:59,331
and I think they do
dictate in this case,

3603
02:34:59,332 --> 02:35:00,832
and the term is "Grenada."

3604
02:35:00,833 --> 02:35:02,417
Have you ever heard of Grenada?

3605
02:35:02,418 --> 02:35:03,585
No. No, I haven't.

3606
02:35:03,586 --> 02:35:05,212
Grenada's very interesting because

3607
02:35:05,213 --> 02:35:07,214
it is a small island nation

3608
02:35:07,215 --> 02:35:10,842
that was invaded by the United
States of America in 1983.

3609
02:35:10,843 --> 02:35:13,011
It's about 90,000 people.

3610
02:35:13,012 --> 02:35:15,331
And essentially, it means

3611
02:35:16,015 --> 02:35:18,058
this case is unloseable.

3612
02:35:18,059 --> 02:35:19,226
Okay?

3613
02:35:19,227 --> 02:35:20,894
So, you know, we can come in,

3614
02:35:20,895 --> 02:35:22,854
we can have our dick
hanging out of our pants.

3615
02:35:22,855 --> 02:35:24,064
Nobody gives a fuck.

3616
02:35:24,065 --> 02:35:25,758
I'm gonna win.

3617
02:35:25,817 --> 02:35:27,294
You, sir.

3618
02:35:28,736 --> 02:35:30,554
Are what's known

3619
02:35:31,489 --> 02:35:32,739
as a Grenada.

3620
02:35:32,740 --> 02:35:33,932
Hmm.

3621
02:35:35,785 --> 02:35:38,245
You're looking at real prison time.

3622
02:35:38,246 --> 02:35:39,329
Hmm.

3623
02:35:39,330 --> 02:35:41,728
Money laundering can get you
as much as 20 years.

3624
02:35:42,625 --> 02:35:45,418
And our case couldn't be stronger
if we caught you

3625
02:35:45,419 --> 02:35:47,170
shoving cash in your mattress.

3626
02:35:47,171 --> 02:35:48,318
Is that right?

3627
02:35:49,090 --> 02:35:51,613
Hey, Jordan. Jordan.

3628
02:35:52,218 --> 02:35:56,096
Your rotting away in jail
till your kids get out of college,

3629
02:35:56,097 --> 02:35:57,870
that's not our ambition here.

3630
02:35:59,141 --> 02:36:01,768
There's other people
involved in this, too.

3631
02:36:01,769 --> 02:36:05,043
We think they need to
see their day in court as well.

3632
02:36:07,525 --> 02:36:09,609
Why do I sense
there's an offer in the air?

3633
02:36:09,610 --> 02:36:12,384
Look at him. He's got a sense.
What are you, Kreskin?

3634
02:36:13,489 --> 02:36:16,366
Full cooperation. He provides
us with a comprehensive list

3635
02:36:16,367 --> 02:36:18,785
of all the co-conspirators
spanning the last seven years,

3636
02:36:18,786 --> 02:36:20,871
and he also agrees to wear a wire.

3637
02:36:20,872 --> 02:36:22,205
Wait...

3638
02:36:22,206 --> 02:36:24,040
Did you just say "wear a wire"?

3639
02:36:24,041 --> 02:36:25,375
A wire. Mmm-hmm.

3640
02:36:25,376 --> 02:36:26,793
What does that mean?

3641
02:36:26,794 --> 02:36:28,753
You want me to rat? Is that it?

3642
02:36:28,754 --> 02:36:30,130
No, I want you to cooperate.

3643
02:36:30,131 --> 02:36:32,132
- No. You want me to rat, right?
- Yes. We want you to rat.

3644
02:36:32,133 --> 02:36:35,658
That's fucking exactly
what we want you to do. To rat.

3645
02:36:40,057 --> 02:36:41,975
How was Cristy's party?

3646
02:36:41,976 --> 02:36:43,143
Fine.

3647
02:36:43,144 --> 02:36:44,587
Good.

3648
02:36:45,646 --> 02:36:48,189
Babe, I spoke to the
lawyers again today.

3649
02:36:48,190 --> 02:36:50,942
I have some really,
really great news.

3650
02:36:50,943 --> 02:36:52,386
Mmm-hmm.

3651
02:36:52,695 --> 02:36:55,389
Turns out you're completely
off the hook, honey.

3652
02:36:56,240 --> 02:36:57,991
I know that already.

3653
02:36:57,992 --> 02:36:59,389
Right. Exactly.

3654
02:36:59,702 --> 02:37:03,022
You never did anything wrong
in the first place, right?

3655
02:37:03,748 --> 02:37:06,067
It turns out, all the FBI really

3656
02:37:06,626 --> 02:37:08,603
wants from me is to, uh,

3657
02:37:08,794 --> 02:37:10,396
to cooperate.

3658
02:37:10,504 --> 02:37:11,838
You know?

3659
02:37:11,839 --> 02:37:13,214
Turns out I have so
much information

3660
02:37:13,215 --> 02:37:14,883
about the stock market
and Wall Street,

3661
02:37:14,884 --> 02:37:16,092
I could save the government

3662
02:37:16,093 --> 02:37:18,094
years of heartache, not to mention

3663
02:37:18,095 --> 02:37:20,573
- countless dollars.
- Mmm-hmm.

3664
02:37:20,890 --> 02:37:23,334
But it gets even better, babe.

3665
02:37:23,684 --> 02:37:26,333
Because if I do
decide to cooperate,

3666
02:37:26,646 --> 02:37:29,522
I might only be
looking at four short years,

3667
02:37:29,523 --> 02:37:31,107
in which case, you know,

3668
02:37:31,108 --> 02:37:34,194
we could start fresh,
maybe sell the house.

3669
02:37:34,195 --> 02:37:35,946
And any fines that I'd have to pay

3670
02:37:35,947 --> 02:37:37,822
wouldn't be due till
after I serve my term,

3671
02:37:37,823 --> 02:37:40,200
so we'd still have plenty of
money left over, you know?

3672
02:37:40,201 --> 02:37:41,723
Mmm-hmm.

3673
02:37:42,745 --> 02:37:45,246
The only thing that of course
bummed me out a little bit

3674
02:37:45,247 --> 02:37:47,600
is this whole idea of having to

3675
02:37:48,125 --> 02:37:50,377
give information about my friends.

3676
02:37:50,378 --> 02:37:53,713
Like you said, "There's no friends
on Wall Street." Right?

3677
02:37:53,714 --> 02:37:55,715
Right. Right. Exactly.

3678
02:37:55,716 --> 02:37:57,384
There's a silver lining
to that, too, honey.

3679
02:37:57,385 --> 02:37:59,177
Because they said eventually...

3680
02:37:59,178 --> 02:38:02,138
Eventually everyone's gonna have to
give information on this case.

3681
02:38:02,139 --> 02:38:05,016
So, at the end of the day, it might
not even be a factor. You know?

3682
02:38:05,017 --> 02:38:07,227
Well, that's good news. Right?

3683
02:38:07,228 --> 02:38:09,062
Yeah, yeah.

3684
02:38:09,063 --> 02:38:10,836
I'm really happy for you.

3685
02:38:12,149 --> 02:38:15,503
What do you mean, happy for me,
sweetheart?

3686
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:18,989
You should be happy for
the both of us. Right?

3687
02:38:18,990 --> 02:38:21,013
- Yeah, right.
- All right.

3688
02:38:23,035 --> 02:38:24,728
Come here, baby.

3689
02:38:25,162 --> 02:38:26,746
Give me a kiss, sweetheart.

3690
02:38:26,747 --> 02:38:27,872
Jordan...

3691
02:38:27,873 --> 02:38:29,124
Oh, come on, baby.

3692
02:38:29,125 --> 02:38:31,418
I haven't made love to
you in so long. Please.

3693
02:38:31,419 --> 02:38:33,920
- No. Jordan, stop it.
- Come on, honey, please.

3694
02:38:33,921 --> 02:38:35,489
No! Jordan, stop it!

3695
02:38:37,091 --> 02:38:39,410
I've loved you
since the moment I saw you.

3696
02:38:43,222 --> 02:38:45,199
I fucking hate you, Jordan.

3697
02:38:45,683 --> 02:38:48,332
- Get off me!
- Baby... Don't do that.

3698
02:38:49,103 --> 02:38:51,126
You know how much I
love you, right?

3699
02:38:51,522 --> 02:38:53,795
Stop that, sweetie. Please.

3700
02:38:58,946 --> 02:39:01,048
You wanna fuck me, Jordan?

3701
02:39:02,742 --> 02:39:04,560
You wanna fuck me?

3702
02:39:05,453 --> 02:39:06,619
Good.

3703
02:39:06,620 --> 02:39:08,063
Go ahead.

3704
02:39:08,456 --> 02:39:10,524
Go ahead and fuck me.

3705
02:39:11,459 --> 02:39:14,002
I want you to fuck me real hard.

3706
02:39:14,003 --> 02:39:16,796
I want you to fuck me
like it's the last fucking time.

3707
02:39:16,797 --> 02:39:18,173
- Why are you moving like that?
- Come on.

3708
02:39:18,174 --> 02:39:19,257
Please hold still.

3709
02:39:19,258 --> 02:39:20,884
'Cause I want you to
come for me, baby.

3710
02:39:20,885 --> 02:39:22,302
Come on, babe.

3711
02:39:22,303 --> 02:39:23,845
Come for me, baby.

3712
02:39:23,846 --> 02:39:25,138
I want you to come for me

3713
02:39:25,139 --> 02:39:26,723
like it's the last fucking time.

3714
02:39:26,724 --> 02:39:28,266
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

3715
02:39:28,267 --> 02:39:30,935
Come on, baby. Come for me.
Come for me, baby.

3716
02:39:30,936 --> 02:39:32,145
Come on, baby.

3717
02:39:32,146 --> 02:39:33,521
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

3718
02:39:33,522 --> 02:39:35,565
- Yeah, baby, come.
- You want me to come for you?

3719
02:39:35,566 --> 02:39:36,838
Yeah.

3720
02:39:37,568 --> 02:39:39,611
- You want me to come for you?
- Yeah!

3721
02:39:39,612 --> 02:39:42,056
Huh? You want me to come for you?

3722
02:39:43,783 --> 02:39:45,575
Oh, God, baby. Yeah!

3723
02:39:45,576 --> 02:39:48,179
Oh, God. Oh, God.

3724
02:39:49,371 --> 02:39:51,815
Oh, God.

3725
02:39:52,374 --> 02:39:53,917
Oh, God.

3726
02:39:53,918 --> 02:39:55,270
Jesus.

3727
02:39:58,798 --> 02:40:00,173
Oh, baby.

3728
02:40:00,174 --> 02:40:02,801
That was so fucking great!

3729
02:40:02,802 --> 02:40:04,154
Oh, God!

3730
02:40:06,430 --> 02:40:08,453
That was the last time.

3731
02:40:08,849 --> 02:40:10,892
What do you mean, baby?

3732
02:40:10,893 --> 02:40:13,963
I mean that was the last time
we ever have sex.

3733
02:40:14,855 --> 02:40:17,049
What are you talking about?

3734
02:40:18,943 --> 02:40:20,670
I want a divorce.

3735
02:40:22,196 --> 02:40:24,239
What do you mean,
you want a divorce?

3736
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:26,366
What's that supposed to mean,
you want a divorce?

3737
02:40:26,367 --> 02:40:28,390
Get off me! I want a divorce.

3738
02:40:28,619 --> 02:40:29,953
You just made love to me.

3739
02:40:29,954 --> 02:40:31,121
What the fuck is wrong with you?

3740
02:40:31,122 --> 02:40:33,566
I don't love you anymore, Jordan!

3741
02:40:34,708 --> 02:40:36,810
Oh, you don't love me?

3742
02:40:37,086 --> 02:40:38,795
You don't love me anymore, huh?

3743
02:40:38,796 --> 02:40:41,089
Well, isn't that just fucking
convenient for you!

3744
02:40:41,090 --> 02:40:43,049
Now that I'm under
federal indictment,

3745
02:40:43,050 --> 02:40:45,051
with an electronic bracelet
around my ankle,

3746
02:40:45,052 --> 02:40:46,886
now you decide you don't
fucking love me anymore.

3747
02:40:46,887 --> 02:40:48,705
- Is that right?
- No, no.

3748
02:40:48,973 --> 02:40:51,307
What kind of person are you?
Tell me.

3749
02:40:51,308 --> 02:40:52,642
You married me!

3750
02:40:52,643 --> 02:40:54,227
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

3751
02:40:54,228 --> 02:40:55,979
Jordan, this is how it's gonna go.

3752
02:40:55,980 --> 02:40:58,231
I'm gonna take custody of the kids.

3753
02:40:58,232 --> 02:41:00,316
If you agree to the
divorce right now,

3754
02:41:00,317 --> 02:41:01,901
I will allow visitation.

3755
02:41:01,902 --> 02:41:03,820
- Okay? Don't try to fight it.
- Oh, my God.

3756
02:41:03,821 --> 02:41:05,321
It'll save us both a lot of money

3757
02:41:05,322 --> 02:41:08,050
and I got a feeling
you're gonna need it.

3758
02:41:09,535 --> 02:41:12,829
You're not taking my kids,
sweetheart. You hear me?

3759
02:41:12,830 --> 02:41:14,330
I've already talked to the lawyer.

3760
02:41:14,331 --> 02:41:15,582
He said even if you
don't get convicted,

3761
02:41:15,583 --> 02:41:16,833
I've got a good chance
of getting them.

3762
02:41:16,834 --> 02:41:18,001
I got news for you.

3763
02:41:18,002 --> 02:41:19,752
You're not fucking
taking my children,

3764
02:41:19,753 --> 02:41:21,526
you vicious fucking cunt, you!

3765
02:41:21,922 --> 02:41:24,007
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!

3766
02:41:24,008 --> 02:41:26,259
You're not fucking taking
my goddamn fucking kids!

3767
02:41:26,260 --> 02:41:27,703
You hear me? Fuck you!

3768
02:41:27,845 --> 02:41:30,698
You're not fucking
taking my fucking kids!

3769
02:41:39,190 --> 02:41:41,024
Fucking bitch!

3770
02:41:43,444 --> 02:41:44,861
Fucking whore!

3771
02:41:49,158 --> 02:41:51,977
Fucking bitch!
Piece of shit fucking whore!

3772
02:42:01,003 --> 02:42:03,880
Look at yourself, Jordan.

3773
02:42:03,881 --> 02:42:05,131
You're sick!

3774
02:42:05,132 --> 02:42:06,382
You're a sick man!

3775
02:42:06,383 --> 02:42:08,468
Fuck you! I told you,
you're not taking my fucking kids!

3776
02:42:08,469 --> 02:42:11,054
You think I would let
my kids near you?

3777
02:42:11,055 --> 02:42:12,305
Look at yourself!

3778
02:42:12,306 --> 02:42:13,848
You know what my lawyer said?

3779
02:42:13,849 --> 02:42:17,435
My lawyer said that you're going to
prison for 20 years, Jordan.

3780
02:42:17,436 --> 02:42:20,772
Twenty fucking years! You're
never gonna see the kids again!

3781
02:42:20,773 --> 02:42:22,023
You don't think I'm
not gonna see my...

3782
02:42:22,024 --> 02:42:23,900
No, I'm not fucking
letting you near my kids!

3783
02:42:23,901 --> 02:42:26,152
You don't think I'm gonna see
my fucking kids again, huh?

3784
02:42:26,153 --> 02:42:27,755
Don't you fucking touch them!

3785
02:42:28,989 --> 02:42:30,932
Don't you fucking touch me!

3786
02:42:32,493 --> 02:42:35,828
Sweetheart? You're coming
on a trip with Daddy, all right?

3787
02:42:35,829 --> 02:42:37,931
You're coming on a trip with Daddy.

3788
02:42:40,584 --> 02:42:42,919
Don't you fucking touch her,
Jordan.

3789
02:42:42,920 --> 02:42:45,773
I swear to God,
I will fucking kill you!

3790
02:42:48,342 --> 02:42:49,676
It's all right, baby.

3791
02:42:49,677 --> 02:42:51,010
You and Daddy are gonna go

3792
02:42:51,011 --> 02:42:52,470
on a little trip together, okay?

3793
02:42:52,471 --> 02:42:54,097
- A little trip together.
- Violet!

3794
02:42:54,098 --> 02:42:55,265
Violet!

3795
02:42:55,266 --> 02:42:57,517
- Get the key! Get the key!
- I got it!

3796
02:42:57,518 --> 02:42:59,227
Jordan, you open this fucking door

3797
02:42:59,228 --> 02:43:02,146
- right now! Open the door!
- Put your seat belt on.

3798
02:43:02,147 --> 02:43:03,523
There you go. Get your legs in.

3799
02:43:03,524 --> 02:43:05,275
I'm taking her with me!

3800
02:43:05,276 --> 02:43:06,567
I told you I'm taking her with me,

3801
02:43:06,568 --> 02:43:07,986
you fucking bitch!

3802
02:43:07,987 --> 02:43:10,806
You're not gonna stop me!
You're not gonna stop me!

3803
02:43:11,490 --> 02:43:13,638
We're going on a
little trip, honey.

3804
02:43:13,993 --> 02:43:15,595
No! No!

3805
02:43:16,078 --> 02:43:17,537
Get the hell out of here!

3806
02:43:17,538 --> 02:43:19,789
Leave that baby alone!

3807
02:43:19,790 --> 02:43:22,041
Violet! Garage door! Close it!

3808
02:43:22,042 --> 02:43:23,251
Mommy!

3809
02:43:23,252 --> 02:43:25,545
- Get out of here!
- Open the fucking door!

3810
02:43:25,546 --> 02:43:27,148
Mommy!

3811
02:43:30,551 --> 02:43:32,278
No!

3812
02:43:39,476 --> 02:43:42,312
Oh, Lord! Oh, my heavens...

3813
02:43:42,313 --> 02:43:43,688
Get the baby!

3814
02:43:43,689 --> 02:43:45,917
Naomi, get the baby!

3815
02:43:46,567 --> 02:43:48,276
- Mommy.
- Honey, it's okay.

3816
02:43:48,277 --> 02:43:49,652
It's gonna be okay.

3817
02:43:49,653 --> 02:43:51,755
Oh, Mr. Jordan has lost his mind.

3818
02:43:52,656 --> 02:43:54,532
- Baby...
- It's all right, honey.

3819
02:43:54,533 --> 02:43:56,200
She all right?

3820
02:43:56,201 --> 02:43:57,553
Is she all right?

3821
02:43:58,245 --> 02:43:59,892
What's the matter with you?

3822
02:44:00,080 --> 02:44:01,523
Is she all right?

3823

Thank you.

3844

Just here?

3845
02:44:49,963 --> 02:44:51,565
That'd be good.

3846
02:44:53,217 --> 02:44:54,425

<i>The first name on the
list was Donnie.</i>

3854
02:45:22,287 --> 02:45:23,830
Jordan, do you know how good it is

3855
02:45:23,831 --> 02:45:25,524
to have you back in this office?

3856
02:45:25,791 --> 02:45:27,917
It's not the same when you're gone.

3857
02:45:27,918 --> 02:45:29,710
It's sad, you understand?
It's like...

3858
02:45:29,711 --> 02:45:31,254
That fucking Steve Madden, huh?

3859
02:45:31,255 --> 02:45:32,505
I can't...

3860
02:45:32,506 --> 02:45:34,382
Swear to God, I can't
even think about it.

3861
02:45:34,383 --> 02:45:36,342
Every time I think about him,
my blood boils.

3862
02:45:36,343 --> 02:45:38,136
I can't even say his name.

3863
02:45:38,137 --> 02:45:39,762
- I know.
- It's, like, disgusting.

3864
02:45:39,763 --> 02:45:42,181
I grew up with this guy
and he betrays me like that.

3865
02:45:42,182 --> 02:45:43,329
Ugh!

3866
02:45:43,392 --> 02:45:46,462
He ever get back to
you about that, um...

3867
02:45:47,104 --> 02:45:49,081
About that account?

3868
02:45:54,695 --> 02:45:55,820
You remember.

3869
02:45:55,821 --> 02:45:57,864
It was like 4 or 5 mil,
something like that, right?

3870
02:45:57,865 --> 02:46:01,139
He was supposed
to kick back 4 or 5 mil, was it?

3871
02:46:05,456 --> 02:46:06,998
Actually, I was...

3872
02:46:06,999 --> 02:46:08,458
I was fucked up, Jordan,

3873
02:46:08,459 --> 02:46:10,042
- so I don't really remember.
- Yeah.

3874
02:46:10,043 --> 02:46:12,145
Yeah, right. Stupid.

3875
02:46:12,713 --> 02:46:14,338
Well, if he calls you,

3876
02:46:14,339 --> 02:46:16,817
you make sure and contact me, okay?

3877
02:46:18,552 --> 02:46:20,303
- Yeah. Of course.
- Yeah.

3878
02:46:20,304 --> 02:46:22,498
Of course, yeah. No, of course.

3879
02:46:25,809 --> 02:46:28,412
You gonna eat that last piece
of yellowtail, bud?

3880
02:46:29,354 --> 02:46:31,172
No, it's all yours.

3881
02:46:31,899 --> 02:46:33,342
Can I get this?

3882
02:46:35,736 --> 02:46:37,588
So, what else is...

3883
02:46:40,240 --> 02:46:42,325
Well, how's Naomi and everything?

3884
02:46:42,326 --> 02:46:43,784
You know how it is.

3885
02:46:43,785 --> 02:46:46,013
She hates my fucking guts.

3886
02:46:47,623 --> 02:46:49,441
How's Hildy? Good?

3887
02:46:50,167 --> 02:46:51,626
She's still alive, so

3888
02:46:51,627 --> 02:46:53,794
my life is fucked, you know?

3889
02:46:53,795 --> 02:46:55,112
Yeah.

3890
02:47:01,803 --> 02:47:03,405
Mr. Jordan.

3891
02:47:03,514 --> 02:47:04,866
Mmm?

3892
02:47:04,973 --> 02:47:07,292
Mr. Jordan, you got a visitor.

3893
02:47:07,559 --> 02:47:08,706
What?

3894
02:47:09,061 --> 02:47:10,913
You've got a visitor.

3895
02:47:26,328 --> 02:47:28,454
I need you to get dressed.

3896
02:47:28,455 --> 02:47:30,728
Why? What the fuck's going on?

3897
02:47:35,671 --> 02:47:37,489
You're going to jail.

3898
02:47:49,434 --> 02:47:50,685
All right.

3899
02:47:50,686 --> 02:47:52,228
I'll get some clothes on.

3900
02:47:52,229 --> 02:47:54,548
We'll give you a hand with that.

3901
02:48:03,323 --> 02:48:04,470
Okay.

3902
02:48:16,628 --> 02:48:17,945
FBI!

3903
02:48:18,297 --> 02:48:19,839
Everybody sit down. Put your hands

3904
02:48:19,840 --> 02:48:21,966
where they can be seen,
and shut up!

3905
02:48:21,967 --> 02:48:23,759
Don't you fucking touch me.

3906
02:48:23,760 --> 02:48:25,970
Get your fucking hands off me!

3907
02:48:25,971 --> 02:48:27,789
Don't get out of your seats!

3908
02:48:40,944 --> 02:48:42,637
It's fucking Chanel!

3909
02:48:55,208 --> 02:48:57,402
<i>I gave up everyone.</i>

3910
02:48:57,461 --> 02:48:59,045
<i>And in return,</i>

3911
02:48:59,046 --> 02:49:03,492
<i>I got three years in some hellhole
in Nevada I'd never even heard of.</i>

3912
02:49:05,302 --> 02:49:07,780
<i>Like my pops, Mad Max, had said,</i>

3913
02:49:08,430 --> 02:49:11,158
<i>"The chickens had
come home to roost."</i>

3914
02:49:12,434 --> 02:49:14,787
<i>Whatever the fuck that means.</i>

3915
02:49:18,231 --> 02:49:19,607
<i>I hope Your Honor would agree</i>

3916
02:49:19,608 --> 02:49:21,734
that Mr. Belfort has
distinguished himself

3917
02:49:21,735 --> 02:49:23,903
in terms of his cooperation.

3918
02:49:23,904 --> 02:49:26,030
Mr. Belfort has helped the
government win convictions

3919
02:49:26,031 --> 02:49:28,680
of over two dozen serious offenders

3920
02:49:29,785 --> 02:49:31,786
and helped them
recover millions of dollars

3921
02:49:31,787 --> 02:49:35,357
to be made available
for restitution to their victims.

3922
02:49:37,501 --> 02:49:39,043
The sentence of the court shall be

3923
02:49:39,044 --> 02:49:41,272
36 months in federal prison.

3924
02:49:42,964 --> 02:49:45,192
Please remand the defendant.

3925
02:49:47,302 --> 02:49:49,154
I'm sorry.

3926
02:49:51,932 --> 02:49:53,079
That's okay.

3927
02:50:41,356 --> 02:50:43,899
<i>I'm not ashamed to admit it.</i>

3928
02:50:43,900 --> 02:50:45,818
<i>When we arrived at the prison,</i>

3929
02:50:45,819 --> 02:50:48,092
<i>I was absolutely terrified.</i>

3930
02:50:48,780 --> 02:50:50,197
Belfort, on your feet.

3931
02:50:50,198 --> 02:50:52,596
<i>But I needn't have been.</i>

3932
02:50:52,743 --> 02:50:55,437
<i>You see, for a brief
fleeting moment,</i>

3933
02:50:56,037 --> 02:50:58,231
<i>I 'd forgotten I was rich.</i>

3934
02:50:59,124 --> 02:51:02,649
<i>And I lived in a place
where everything was for sale.</i>

3935
02:51:05,088 --> 02:51:07,840
<i>Wouldn't you like to
learn how to sell it?</i>

3936
02:51:07,841 --> 02:51:10,843
<i>So listen. I've met some
bad motherfuckers in my life.</i>

3937
02:51:10,844 --> 02:51:12,261
<i>I'm talking about rock stars,</i>

3938
02:51:12,262 --> 02:51:14,346
<i>professional athletes, gangsters.</i>

3939
02:51:14,347 --> 02:51:16,223
<i>I'm telling you,
some real bad motherfuckers.</i>

3940
02:51:16,224 --> 02:51:18,642
<i>But this guy, my good friend,</i>

3941
02:51:18,643 --> 02:51:21,479
<i>Mr. Jordan Belfort, is the single</i>

3942
02:51:21,480 --> 02:51:24,333
baddest motherfucker
I have ever met.

3943
02:51:24,816 --> 02:51:26,609
So I want you right now

3944
02:51:26,610 --> 02:51:29,820
to give a warm Auckland,
New Zealand welcome

3945
02:51:29,821 --> 02:51:31,489
for my good friend

3946
02:51:31,490 --> 02:51:34,283
and the world's
greatest sales trainer,

3947
02:51:34,284 --> 02:51:35,476
Mr. Jordan Belfort!

3948
02:51:47,506 --> 02:51:48,903
Thank you.

3949
02:52:11,738 --> 02:52:13,556
Sell me this pen.

3950
02:52:18,078 --> 02:52:20,180
It's, uh...

3951
02:52:20,413 --> 02:52:22,265
It's an amazing pen.

3952
02:52:22,457 --> 02:52:24,730
For professionals, it's a...

3953
02:52:27,754 --> 02:52:29,572
Sell me this pen.

3954
02:52:30,507 --> 02:52:31,757
Well, it's a nice pen.

3955
02:52:31,758 --> 02:52:33,133
You can use the pen

3956
02:52:33,134 --> 02:52:36,488
to write down thoughts
from your life so you can...

3957
02:52:38,181 --> 02:52:39,703
Sell me

3958
02:52:39,975 --> 02:52:41,622
this pen.

3959
02:52:43,520 --> 02:52:44,792
Well...

3960
02:52:45,105 --> 02:52:48,800
This pen works and I
personally love this pen...
