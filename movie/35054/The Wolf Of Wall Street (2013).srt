1
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,007
The world of investing can be a jungle.

2
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,260
Bulls. Bears.

3
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,220
Danger at every turn.

4
00:00:54,763 --> 00:01:00,351
That's why we at Stratton Oakmont
pride ourselves on being the best.

5
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:04,897
Trained professionals to guide you
through the financial wilderness.

6
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,983
Stratton Oakmont.

7
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:08,943
Stability.

8
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,737
Integrity.

9
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:12,613
Pride.

10
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,033
One!

11
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:17,827
Two!

12
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,495
Three!

13
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:28,504
Twenty-five grand to the first
cocksucker to nail a bull's-eye!

14
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,340
Come on! Let's go!

15
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,010
One!

16
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,511
Two!

17
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:37,722
Three!

18
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,349
My name is Jordan Belfort.

19
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,642
Not him.

20
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,436
Me. That's right.

21
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,396
I'm a former member
of the middle class

22
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:49,358
raised by two accountants
in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens.

23
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:53,112
The year I turned 26,
as the head of my own brokerage firm,

24
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:55,823
I made $49 million,

25
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:59,327
which really pissed me off because
it was three shy of a million a week.

26
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,625
No, no, no. My Ferrari was white,

27
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,878
like Don Johnson's in Miami Vice.
Not red.

28
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,426
See that humongous estate down there?

29
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:16,844
That's my house.

30
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,471
For millionaires whose ships...

31
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:22,809
My wife, Naomi,
the Duchess of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn,

32
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,019
a former model and Miller Lite girl.

33
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,146
Yeah.

34
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,774
She was the one with my cock
in her mouth in the Ferrari.

35
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,401
So put your dick back in your pants.

36
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,196
In addition to Naomi
and my two perfect kids,

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,156
I own a mansion, private jet,

38
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,866
six cars, three horses,

39
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:42,537
two vacation homes,
and a 170-foot yacht.

40
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,456
Anchors aweigh!

41
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,213
I also gamble like a degenerate.
I drink like a fish.

42
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,091
I fuck hookers maybe
five, six times a week.

43
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,010
I have three different federal agencies
looking to indict me.

44
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,763
Oh, yeah, and I love drugs.

45
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,270
Okay.

46
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,522
- One more round.
- Oh, yeah.

47
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,440
- Oh, you like it?
- Yeah.

48
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,121
Pull up. Pull up!
We're gonna crash, for Christ sake!

49
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,455
Relax!

50
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,500
Just relax.

51
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,638
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

52
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,307
Good job.

53
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,976
You get in there safe, all right?

54
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,895
Till the next time, brother.

55
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,521
Till next time.

56
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,363
Yup, on a daily basis
I consume enough drugs

57
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:04,869
to sedate Manhattan,
Long Island and Queens for a month.

58
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:06,996
Okay, Mr. Jordan.

59
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:10,666
I take Quaaludes 10 to 15 times a day
for my "back pain,"

60
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,585
Adderall to stay focused,

61
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,588
Xanax to take the edge off,
pot to mellow me out,

62
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,633
cocaine to wake me back up again
and morphine, well,

63
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,176
because it's awesome.

64
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,385
Good morning, Nathan.

65
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,645
But of all the drugs
under God's blue heaven,

66
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,772
there is one that is my absolute favorite.

67
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,358
You see,

68
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,819
enough of this shit'll
make you invincible.

69
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,614
Able to conquer the world,

70
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,824
and eviscerate your enemies.

71
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,955
And I'm not talking about this.

72
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,957
I'm talking about this.

73
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,837
See, money doesn't
just buy you a better life,

74
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,423
better food, better cars, better pussy.

75
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,801
It also makes you a better person.

76
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,471
You can give generously to the church
or political party of your choice.

77
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,683
You can save the fucking
spotted owl with money.

78
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,690
I always wanted to be rich.
So let me go back.

79
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,067
I'm 22 years old, newly married,

80
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,736
and already a money-crazed little shit.

81
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:21,988
So what do I do?

82
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,408
I go to the one place on Earth
that befit my high-minded ambitions.

83
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,078
I love you.

84
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,717
You are lower than pond scum.

85
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,761
You got a problem with that,

86
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,513
Jordan?

87
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,682
No. No problem at all.

88
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,475
Good. Because that is what you are.

89
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,935
Pond scum.

90
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,270
Your job is connector,

91
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,107
which means that you'll be dialing
the phone over 500 times a day

92
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,110
trying to connect me
with wealthy business owners.

93
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,154
And until you pass your Series 7,

94
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,448
that is all you're gonna
fucking be doing. Sit.

95
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,782
Sit!

96
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,203
Now just so you know,
last year I made over $300,000.

97
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:14,874
The other guy you'll be working for,
he made over a million.

98
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,584
A million dollars?

99
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,628
I could only imagine
what a douchebag that guy must be.

100
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,631
- Jordan Belfort.
- Yes, sir.

101
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,383
- Mark Hanna.
- A pleasure to meet you.

102
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,053
And you as well. I see you've
already met the village asshole.

103
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,763
Smile and dial.

104
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,348
And don't pick up
your fucking head until 1:00.

105
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:32,975
Hey, fuck him.

106
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,686
I'm the senior broker here.
He's just a worthless piker.

107
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,563
Why don't you blow me, Hanna?

108
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,983
Now did you really pitch
a stock in your job interview?

109
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,818
I had to do something
to stand out. Right, sir?

110
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,571
I fucking love that.

111
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,782
- Lunch. Today.
- Yeah.

112
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,701
We don't start dialing at 9:30

113
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,662
because our clients
are already answering the phone.

114
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,373
Three. Two. One.

115
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,458
Let's fuck!

116
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,128
You want to know
what money sounds like?

117
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,172
Go to a trading floor on Wall Street.

118
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,715
"Fuck" this, "shit" that.

119
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,342
"Cunt," "cock," "asshole."

120
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,511
I couldn't believe
how these guys talked to each other.

121
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,887
- Good fucking package...
- Piece of shit!

122
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,597
I was hooked in seconds.

123
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,850
It was like mainlining adrenaline.

124
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,228
Yeah. Fuckface, look at
where the stock's at today, huh?

125
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,189
You motherfucker,
you can't get any at 44...

126
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,566
- Pick up the cocksucking phone!
- Sorry...

127
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,488
You are such
a fucking douchebag, Hanna.

128
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,324
We don't give two shits
about how technology works

129
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,035
because all we care about
is getting fucking rich.

130
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,411
- Solid, 2,000.
- Jordan Belfort.

131
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,915
Done!

132
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,625
Time to paint the tape.

133
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,963
2,000. Microsoft. Going in the hole!

134
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,339
Come on.

135
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:49,093
Live. Live. Hold on, that is hot.

136
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,097
In. In. Shut that motherfucker.
Shut it! Shut it! Shut it!

137
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,306
Sold!

138
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,742
Yeah.

139
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,001
Tootski?

140
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,503
Oh, no. Thank you, though.

141
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:27,173
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you
on this glorious afternoon?

142
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,967
Well, Hector, here's the game plan.

143
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,511
You're gonna bring us
two Absolut martinis.

144
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,138
You know how I like them. Straight up.

145
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,849
And then precisely seven
and one half minutes after that,

146
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,267
you're gonna bring us two more.

147
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:41,645
Then two more after that
every five minutes

148
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,939
until one of us passes the fuck out.

149
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,650
Excellent strategy, sir.

150
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,569
I'm good with water for now.

151
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,987
Thank you.

152
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,948
It's his first day on Wall Street.
Give him time.

153
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,743
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

154
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:57,786
Mr. Hanna?

155
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:04,168
You're able to do drugs during the day
and then still function, still do your job?

156
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,086
How the fuck else
would you do this job?

157
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,339
Cocaine and hookers, my friend.

158
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,840
Right.

159
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:15,638
Well, I got to say, I'm incredibly excited
to be a part of your firm. I mean...

160
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,598
The clients you have are absolutely...

161
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,141
Fuck the clients.

162
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,978
Your only responsibility
is to put meat on the table.

163
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,314
You got a girlfriend?

164
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,941
I'm married. I have a wife.

165
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,109
Her name is Teresa. She cuts hair.

166
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,486
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

167
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,904
Think about Teresa.

168
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,155
Name of the game.

169
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:37,076
Move the money from
your client's pocket into your pocket.

170
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,244
Right.

171
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,995
But if you make your clients
money at the same time,

172
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,331
it's advantageous to everyone. Correct?

173
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,166
No.

174
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,169
Number one rule of Wall Street.

175
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,338
Nobody...

176
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,590
I don't care if you're Warren Buffett
or if you're Jimmy Buffett.

177
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:56,303
Nobody knows if a stock is gonna go up,
down, sideways, or in fucking circles.

178
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,389
Least of all stockbrokers, right?

179
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,058
It's all a fugazi.
You know what a fugazi is?

180
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,519
Fugayzi. It's a fake.

181
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,021
Fugayzi, fugazi,
it's a whazy, it's a woozy, it's...

182
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,440
Fairy dust. It doesn't exist.

183
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,944
It's never landed. It is no matter.
It's not on the elemental chart.

184
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,029
It's not fucking real.

185
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,948
- Right?
- Right.

186
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,741
Stay with me.

187
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,119
We don't create shit.
We don't build anything.

188
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,370
No.

189
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,290
So if you got a client
who bought stock at eight

190
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,792
and it now sits at 16,
he's all fucking happy.

191
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,962
He wants to cash in, liquidate,
take his fucking money and run home.

192
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,006
- You don't let him do that.
- Okay.

193
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,966
- 'Cause that would make it real.
- Right.

194
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,301
No. What do you do?

195
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,344
You get another brilliant idea.

196
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,887
A special idea.

197
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:43,559
Another "situation." Another stock
to reinvest his earnings and then some.

198
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,894
And he will, every single time.

199
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,063
'Cause they're fucking addicted.

200
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,233
And you just keep doing this,
again and again and again.

201
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,986
Meanwhile, he thinks
he's getting shit rich,

202
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,155
which he is, on paper.

203
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,906
But you and me, the brokers,

204
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:02,119
we're taking home cold hard cash
via commission, motherfucker.

205
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:03,912
Right.

206
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,584
That's incredible, sir.
I can't tell you how excited I am.

207
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,127
You should be.

208
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,964
There's two keys to success
in the broker business.

209
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,632
First of all...

210
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,678
- You gotta stay relaxed.
- Yeah.

211
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:20,888
Do you jerk off?

212
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,016
Do I... Do I jerk off?

213
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,310
Yeah. Yeah, I jerk off. Yeah.

214
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,686
How many times a week?

215
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,356
Like three or four.

216
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,733
- Three or four times, maybe five.
- Gotta pump those numbers up.

217
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,319
Those are rookie numbers
in this racket.

218
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:39,073
I myself, I jerk off at least twice a day.

219
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,866
- Wow.
- Once in the morning

220
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,410
right after I work out,
then once right after lunch.

221
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,870
Really?

222
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,873
I want to. That's not why I do it.

223
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,084
I do it 'cause I fucking need to.

224
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,669
Think about it.
You're dealing with numbers.

225
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,714
All day long, decimal points,
high frequencies.

226
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,840
Bang, bang, bang.

227
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,134
Fucking digits.

228
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,638
All very acidic
above-the-shoulders mustard shit.

229
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,972
All right?

230
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,558
It kind of wigs some people out. Right.

231
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,769
You got to feed the geese
to keep the blood flowing.

232
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,521
I keep the rhythm below the belt.

233
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,855
Done.

234
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,607
This is not a tip, this is a prescription.

235
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,858
Trust me.

236
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,444
If you don't, you will fall out of balance,

237
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,655
split your differential
and tip the fuck over.

238
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,031
Or worse yet,

239
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:23,325
I've seen this happen, implode.

240
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,868
No, I don't want to implode, sir.

241
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,120
No. No, you don't.

242
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,454
I'm in it for the long run, you know?

243
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,123
- Implosions are ugly.
- Yeah.

244
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,375
Pop off to the bathroom,
work one out any time you can.

245
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,459
When you get really good at it,

246
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,671
you'll fucking be stroking it
and you'll be thinking about money.

247
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:40,843
Second key to success in this racket

248
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,177
is this little baby right here.

249
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,637
It's called cocaine.

250
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,013
Right.

251
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,934
It'll keep you sharp between the ears.
It'll also help your fingers dial faster.

252
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,394
And guess what?

253
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,020
That's good for me.

254
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,022
Yes, sir.

255
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,275
Revolutions. You follow?

256
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,443
Revolutions.

257
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,778
Keep the clients on the Ferris wheel.

258
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:03,407
And it goes. The park is open 24/7, 365,

259
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,410
every decade, every goddamn century.

260
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,911
That's it.

261
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,705
The name of the game.

262
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,291
Halkidiki?

263
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,500
Thank you.

264
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:26,930
Come on.

265
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,062
We're the common denominator.

266
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,156
Keep it up for me.

267
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,158
You've seen the echo

268
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,784
And the money comes in

269
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,287
The parade comes to town

270
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,164
Going down Broadway

271
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,832
It's a one-way street

272
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,167
Whichever way I go

273
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,464
The next six months,

274
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,883
I got to know the ins
and outs of Wall Street.

275
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:06,595
Earning shit money as I geared up
to take my Series 7.

276
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,810
Oh, fuckers.

277
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:24,696
Then I was a licensed broker at last,

278
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,740
ready to make my fortune.

279
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:31,411
My first day as a future
Master of the Universe.

280
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,004
I have Exxon at 861/4 six months ago.

281
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,465
Today it is trading at 361/2.

282
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,716
Mr...

283
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,098
They called it Black Monday.

284
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,391
No shit.

285
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:56,562
By 4:00 p.m., the market
had dropped 508 points.

286
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,481
The biggest plummet
since the crash of '29.

287
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,941
I know your family, you know mine.

288
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,027
No, I don't know. Some fucking
country in Europe took a shit.

289
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,445
Let them do
what they want to fucking do.

290
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,780
Our market's solid.

291
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,490
This is not something
that you want to sell.

292
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,158
You know what happened?
A fucking tsunami.

293
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,535
I think you're making a big mistake.

294
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,036
Yes, I will talk to your wife.

295
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,204
Trust me, do not answer the phone.

296
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,249
A lot of people are gonna be calling you,
trying to get your dirty laundry.

297
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,625
We don't know what's going on here.

298
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,960
I know. I know.

299
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,388
Holy

300
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,309
fucking shit!

301
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,729
Unbelievable.

302
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,273
My first shitty day as a broker.

303
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,775
Within a month, L.F. Rothschild,

304
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,572
an institution since 1899,
closed its doors.

305
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,074
Wall Street had swallowed me up

306
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,535
and shit me right back out again.

307
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,207
We could pawn my engagement ring
if we needed to.

308
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,792
- Babe...
- Because I don't mind.

309
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:01,960
If we needed to, I'm saying...

310
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,587
- Will you listen to me?
- Okay.

311
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,797
You're not pawning anything. Okay?

312
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,257
- Okay.
- What do I always tell you?

313
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,467
You're gonna be a millionaire.

314
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,053
That's right. Okay? Just let me look.

315
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,220
We'll find something.

316
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,972
- How about this?
- What?

317
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,516
Nobody Beats the Wiz,
the electronics store.

318
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,060
Stock boy. What do you think?

319
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,394
You're not gonna work at that place.

320
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,520
Yeah, but, you know, you start off...

321
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,688
Jordan, you're gonna be
miserable at that place

322
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:22,814
- if you go there.
- I know.

323
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,108
It's sales. You work your way up,
you'll be a general manager.

324
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,985
- You're not gonna be a stock boy.
- Why not?

325
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,737
'Cause you're a stockbroker.

326
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,198
You understand that
nobody's hiring stockbrokers right now?

327
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,741
You understand that?

328
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,284
Okay?

329
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,041
This place is.

330
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,834
- What?
- What's that say?

331
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,127
"Stockbrokers."

332
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
In Long Island?

333
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,548
- Stockbrokers in Long Island?
- Yeah.

334
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,342
It's in Long Island. So what?

335
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,197
Hey, I'm looking for Investor's Center.

336
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,117
What's that? You want to invest?

337
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,286
No. Investor's Center.
I'm looking for Investor's Center.

338
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:22,040
Yeah, yeah, that's us. Hey.
This is it. This is it.

339
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,667
- I'm Dwayne. Yeah.
- You're Dwayne?

340
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,752
Hi, Dwayne. We spoke on the phone.

341
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,295
I'm Jordan Belfort.

342
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,631
I'm the broker from
Rothschild in New York.

343
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,800
Yes, yeah. Have a seat. How are you?

344
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,009
We had a conversation...

345
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,344
We spoke on the phone earlier, right?

346
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,762
- Two hours ago.
- Right.

347
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:36,847
Yeah.

348
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,976
They're up and comers.
That's what that means.

349
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,894
It's three cents a share, that's $3!

350
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,438
You cheap fuck!

351
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,398
So...

352
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,443
So where are your Quotrons here?

353
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,403
- Quotrons?
- Yeah. Your computers.

354
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,779
No, no. We don't even
need computers here.

355
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,573
We just trade right off
the pink sheets here.

356
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,491
- Pink sheets?
- Yeah, they're penny stocks.

357
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,410
You know, companies that
can't get listed on NASDAQ,

358
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,661
they don't have enough capital?

359
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:00,871
Their shares trade here.

360
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,664
- Penny stocks?
- Yeah.

361
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,625
This one, Aerodyne,
is a really interesting...

362
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,085
Or Aerotyne...

363
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,628
Aerotyne, yeah.

364
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,338
Aero... Aerotyne...

365
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:11,798
Aerotyne. Yeah.

366
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,008
Very hot stock right now.

367
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,092
Oh, yeah?

368
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:15,427
They're just a couple
of brothers that are making

369
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,803
radar detectors out of their garage.

370
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:17,929
They're out in Dubuque.

371
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,264
Maybe it's microwaves. I'm not sure.

372
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,766
But you call the company's main line,

373
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,642
their mom, Dorothy, answers
and she is so sweet.

374
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,644
- Good company.
- I actually don't know what else to...

375
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,314
I don't know anything else
about them other than that.

376
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,940
Six cents a share?

377
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,985
Hey, come on. Who buys this crap?

378
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,195
Well, I mean...

379
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:34,613
Honestly, mostly schmucks.

380
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,698
Postmen, there's always postmen.

381
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,700
Plumbers.

382
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,828
They see our ads in the back
of Hustler and Popular Mechanics.

383
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,748
Our ads actually say
they can get rich quick.

384
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,041
- Hustler?
- Yeah.

385
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,334
You know, those girlie magazines.

386
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,877
Yeah, yeah. Nudie mag.

387
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,086
- A lot.
- Yeah.

388
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,797
We're helping them finance houses,

389
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,799
we're helping them
buy their wife a diamond ring...

390
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:54,925
A boat maybe.

391
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,886
Is this... Is this stuff regulated
or are you guys...

392
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,054
What are you doing here?

393
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,933
Sort of.

394
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,226
Sort of?

395
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,480
Jesus Christ,
the spread on these is huge.

396
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,815
Yeah. And that's the point, that's...

397
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:10,982
What's your name again?

398
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,400
Mine... Jordan Belfort.

399
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,319
Jordan, what do you get
on that blue chip stock?

400
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:17,405
I make one percent.
Or I did make one percent.

401
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,324
Pink sheets, it's 50.

402
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,578
It's 50%?

403
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,789
50% commission?

404
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,582
- Yup.
- For what?

405
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,793
It's our markup for our services.

406
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:32,587
And so if I... If I...

407
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,716
If I sell a stock at $10,000,
my commission is 5,000 bucks?

408
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,344
If you sell $10,000 worth of this stock,

409
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,013
I will personally give you
a blowjob for free.

410
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,475
And I hope it happens.

411
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,104
Hello, John, how are you doing today?

412
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,815
You mailed in my company
a postcard a few weeks back

413
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,735
requesting information on penny stocks
that had huge upside potential

414
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,487
with very little downside risk.

415
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,489
- Does that ring a bell?
- Yeah, I may have sent something.

416
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:02,701
Okay, great.
The reason for the call today, John, is,

417
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,453
something just came
across my desk, John.

418
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,540
It is perhaps the best thing
I've seen in the last six months.

419
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,543
If you have 60 seconds, I'd like to share
the idea with you. You got a minute?

420
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,627
Actually, I'm really very...

421
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,171
The name of the company,
Aerotyne International.

422
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:18,508
It is a cutting edge
high-tech firm out of the Midwest

423
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,510
awaiting imminent patent approval

424
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:23,138
on the next generation
of radar detectors

425
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:27,642
that have both huge military
and civilian applications now.

426
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,019
Right now, John,

427
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,563
the stock trades over-the-counter
at 10 cents a share.

428
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,024
And by the way, John,
our analysts indicate

429
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,401
it could go a heck
of a lot higher than that.

430
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:42,449
Your profit on a mere $6,000 investment
would be upwards of $60,000!

431
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,075
Jesus! That's my mortgage, man.

432
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,744
Exactly. You could
pay off your mortgage.

433
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,329
This stock will pay off my house?

434
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,498
John, one thing I can promise you,
even in this market,

435
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:54,085
is that I never ask my clients
to judge me on my winners.

436
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:57,756
I ask them to judge me on my losers
because I have so few.

437
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,424
And in the case of Aerotyne,

438
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,135
based on every technical factor
out there, John,

439
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,347
we are looking at
a grand slam home run.

440
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,308
Okay, let's do it. I'll do four grand.

441
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,602
$4,000? That'd be 40,000 shares, John.

442
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,145
Let me lock in that trade right now

443
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,521
and get back to you with my secretary

444
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,523
with an exact confirmation.
Sound good, John?

445
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,858
- Yeah, sounds good.
- Great.

446
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,109
Hey, John.

447
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,236
Thank you for your vote of confidence.

448
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,738
And welcome to the Investor's Center.

449
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,948
Yeah, thanks a lot, man.

450
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,324
Bye-bye.

451
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,371
How'd you fucking do that?

452
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,125
Just like that, I made two grand.

453
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,962
The other guys looked at me
like I'd just discovered fire.

454
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,798
Great! Even better!

455
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:43,551
I was selling garbage to garbage men
and making cash hand over fist.

456
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,179
The only problem you're gonna have
is that you didn't buy more.

457
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,891
So I was selling them shit.

458
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,728
But the way I looked at it,
their money was better off in my pocket.

459
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,647
I knew how to spend it better.

460
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,400
Excuse me. Is that your car in the lot?

461
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,901
Yeah.

462
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,945
- It's a nice ride.
- Thanks, man.

463
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,238
Donnie Azoff.

464
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,364
Hey. I'm Jordan Belfort.

465
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,740
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

466
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,659
You know, actually,
I see that car around.

467
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,411
- I see it around a lot.
- Oh, yeah, where?

468
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,287
I think we live in the same building.

469
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,455
- No shit?
- Yeah, yeah.

470
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,249
- Twelfth floor?
- Yeah. What floor are you on?

471
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,458
Fourth floor.

472
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,377
- I have two little kids. Ugly wife.
- Right.

473
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,422
What do you do, bro?

474
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,383
What do you mean, what do I do?

475
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,676
For work, what do you do?

476
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,927
I'm a stockbroker.

477
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,762
- Stockbroker?
- Yeah.

478
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,431
Children's furniture.

479
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,807
Oh, good for you.

480
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,267
It's all right.

481
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,810
You make a lot of money?

482
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,938
Yeah, I do all right for myself.

483
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,273
I'm trying to put it together.

484
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:41,317
You got your fucking nice car,
we live in the same building. I just...

485
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,987
I'm not understanding...
How much money do you make?

486
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,866
I don't know. $70,000 last month.

487
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,743
Get the fuck...

488
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,619
Get the fuck out of here.

489
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,954
No, I'm serious.

490
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,289
Yeah, no, I'm serious, too.

491
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,416
Seriously, how much money
do you make?

492
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,793
I told you. $70,000.

493
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,421
Well, technically, $72,000.

494
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,465
Last month. Something like that.

495
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,551
You made 72 grand in one month?

496
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,802
Yeah.

497
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,475
I'll tell you what.

498
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,728
You show me a pay stub
for $72,000 on it,

499
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,147
I quit my job right now
and I work for you.

500
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,489
Hey, Paulie, what's up?

501
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:29,908
No, yeah, yeah. No, everything's fine.

502
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,409
Hey, listen, I quit.

503
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,369
And he did quit his job.

504
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:36,414
Which I thought was a little weird.
I mean, I just met this fucking guy.

505
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,374
Don't fucking tell Susan.
It's none of her business.

506
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:39,793
There were other things about him, too.

507
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,003
Like his phosphorescent white teeth.

508
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,254
...wife! I gotta fucking
deal with your wife?

509
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,507
The fact that he wore
horn rims with clear lenses

510
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,550
just to look more WASP-y.

511
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,512
And then, there were these rumors.

512
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,223
I heard some stupid shit. I don't know.

513
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,767
Fuck, I didn't even want
to bring it up. It's just...

514
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,644
- It's stupid.
- Shit with me?

515
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,896
You know, people say shit.
I don't even know.

516
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,398
I don't even listen to it half the time.

517
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,067
What are they saying?

518
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,612
Shit about you and your cousin
or something like that.

519
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,905
I don't even listen to it.

520
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,533
Bro, it's not like that.

521
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,076
It's not like that.

522
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,870
Like you married your cousin
or some stupid shit. No?

523
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:17,956
Yeah, my wife. Yeah.

524
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,791
My wife is my cousin, or whatever.

525
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,502
But it's not like what you think,
or whatever, you know.

526
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,546
Is she like a first cousin, or is she...

527
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,880
Yeah, no, she's, you know...

528
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,924
Her... Her father

529
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,677
is the brother of my mom.

530
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,387
It's not like, what... You know.

531
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,013
Look, we grew up together.

532
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,474
And she grew up hot, you know.
She fucking grew up hot.

533
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,309
And all my friends were
trying to fuck her, you know.

534
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,270
And I'm not gonna let someone...

535
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,938
You know, one of these assholes
fuck my cousin,

536
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,483
so, you know, I used the cousin thing
as like an in with her.

537
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,069
I'm not gonna let
someone else fuck my cousin.

538
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,821
You know, if anyone's
gonna fuck my cousin,

539
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,781
it's gonna be me,
out of respect. You know?

540
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:52,991
No, I get it. Yeah.

541
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,243
I mean, you're not afraid of like
the whole kid thing, right?

542
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,536
- What? Having kids with her?
- Yeah.

543
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,829
No. We have two kids.

544
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,372
And they're... I mean...

545
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,041
I don't want to get personal,
but they're okay?

546
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,252
No, they're not retarded
or anything like that.

547
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,254
But there's a big chance, right, if...

548
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,673
Yeah, there's like a 60%, you know,

549
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:12,260
60 to 65% chance the kid's
gonna be fucking retarded or whatever.

550
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,428
That'd scare the shit out of me, buddy.

551
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,847
Look, man, a lot of having a kid,
or whatever, takes risk,

552
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,682
whether you're fucking cousins or not.

553
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,518
What if something like that happened?

554
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:22,187
Basically, you know,
if the kid was retarded,

555
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:25,565
I would, you know,
drive it up to the country

556
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,317
and just, like, you know,
open the door and say,

557
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,611
"You're free now."
You know, like, "Run free."

558
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,196
You know?

559
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,952
You're completely fucking with me.

560
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,956
That's horrible. You're not gonna...

561
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,625
You look like you've... No.

562
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,543
We would take it to, like,
an institution or somewhere

563
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:48,421
that's handled to, like, you know,
raise the kid or whatever.

564
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,049
You know what? If you're happy,
God bless you, buddy.

565
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:54,469
No, I'm not fucking happy.
No one who's married is fucking happy.

566
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,304
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, buddy.

567
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,389
Listen, I'm really, you know...

568
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,808
I'm really appreciative
for this fucking job.

569
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,060
I'm really enjoying it.

570
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,561
I'm really happy with what you're doing.

571
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,939
Actually, I got you a little present.

572
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,440
- You got me a present?
- I got you something.

573
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,816
Oh, fuck. You're sweet.

574
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,151
Yeah. It's in the back though.

575
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,612
- What do you mean?
- You gotta go out back.

576
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,989
Like it's wrapped up or something?

577
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,574
It's wrapped up. Yeah.

578
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:17,784
- I don't get it.
- Neither do I.

579
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,327
Let's fucking go. Come on.

580
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,579
Your turn.

581
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,748
I'm not fucking doing this.
You're out of your fucking mind.

582
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,792
- Smoke this shit, bro.
- No.

583
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,877
No one's fucking here, bro.

584
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,003
Get the fuck...

585
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,880
Fucking smoke crack with me, bro.

586
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,090
I'm not fucking doing it.

587
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,884
Smoke crack. Smoke some
fucking crack with me, bro.

588
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:37,345
- One hit. One hit. That's it.
- Okay.

589
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,347
Fucking nut job.

590
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,079
Wow!

591
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,874
Wow.

592
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:11,879
Let's go run, huh?

593
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,090
We gotta get out of here, buddy.

594
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,968
We gotta get out of here.
Let's go fucking run.

595
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,471
Let's run like we're fucking lions
and tigers and bears!

596
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:23,057
Let's run! Let's fucking run!

597
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:25,143
Let's fucking run! Go!

598
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:26,602
Go, go, go, go!

599
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,064
You've reached Frank's Best Auto Body.

600
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,649
We're closed right now.

601
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,735
So please leave us a message.

602
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,486
Hello. My name is Jordan Belfort.

603
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:38,990
My partner and I are very interested
in renting out your garage.

604
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,534
Donnie and I were
going out on our own.

605
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,953
And the first thing
we needed was brokers.

606
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:45,955
Guys with sales experience.

607
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,957
So I recruited
some of my hometown boys.

608
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:51,210
Sea Otter, who sold meat and weed.

609
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:54,672
Chester, who sold tires and weed.

610
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:57,592
And Robbie, who sold anything
he could get his hands on.

611
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:58,968
Mostly weed.

612
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,596
Can you bring me some ketchup? Okay?

613
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,097
This is Brad.

614
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,849
And Brad's the guy I really wanted.

615
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,184
But he didn't go along with us.

616
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,811
He was already making
so much money selling Quaaludes,

617
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,647
he'd become the Quaalude king
of Bayside.

618
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:12,815
Getting any pussy
with that thing or what?

619
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,858
Yeah, man, of course.

620
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,860
Bring some of them chicks
around here sometime, huh?

621
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,195
Let 'em watch.

622
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,113
Let 'em watch. Know what I mean?

623
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:23,201
Hey, Zip! You tell your sister
I was asking about her.

624
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,454
Why don't you bring me a pair of
her panties next time you come through.

625
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,374
Yeah, man. She said she don't want
to talk to you anymore, man.

626
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,666
Get the fuck out of here.

627
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:33,961
Hey, Ma, we got chicken or what?

628
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,005
Ma!

629
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,674
You listening? It's easier than you think.

630
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,218
Every person you're on the phone with,

631
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,804
they want to get rich
and they want to get rich quickly.

632
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,055
They all want something for nothing.

633
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,599
There was this one time that
I was selling pot to this Amish dude.

634
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,059
You know those guys
who got like the beard

635
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,186
with like no mustache or some bullshit?

636
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:54,148
Well, he says that he only
wants to make furniture.

637
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:55,733
I don't understand.

638
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:56,984
What's that got to do with anything?

639
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,945
What the fuck are you talking about?

640
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,905
I'm not putting words
in your mouth or nothing,

641
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,158
but you just said that
everybody wants to get rich.

642
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,661
Holy fuck, you did just say that.

643
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,080
What the fuck are you talking about?

644
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,249
Yeah, like Buddhists.
They don't give a shit about money.

645
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,334
They're wrapped in sheets.
They're not buying shit.

646
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,169
I'm not talking about
Buddhists or Amish.

647
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,005
I'm talking about normal people,
working-class, everyday people.

648
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,007
Everyone wants to get rich. Am I crazy?

649
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,384
There's no such thing
as an Amish Buddhist.

650
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,344
- I'm pretty fucking sure.
- There could be.

651
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,680
Can we get some ketchup, please?

652
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,140
Do you guys not want to make money?

653
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,975
I want to make some money.

654
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,351
I want to make
some fucking money, okay.

655
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:31,769
I can sell anything.

656
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:33,771
Shit, I can sell ludes
to a convent full of nuns,

657
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:35,773
and get them so horny
they'd be fucking each other.

658
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,692
That's the attitude.
You can sell anything?

659
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,360
Sell me this fucking pen right here.

660
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,112
You can sell anything.
Sell that. Go ahead.

661
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,363
Sell me the pen.

662
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,158
Can I finish eating first?
I haven't eaten today.

663
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,618
Brad, show them how it's done. Boom.

664
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,203
Sell me that pen. Watch. Go on.

665
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,830
You want me to sell this fucking pen?

666
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,416
That's my boy right there.
Can fucking sell anything.

667
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
Why don't you do me a favor.

668
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,252
Write your name down
on that napkin for me.

669
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,378
I don't have a pen.

670
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,172
Exactly. Supply and demand, my friend.

671
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:00,339
- Holy shit.
- See what I'm saying?

672
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:01,799
He's creating urgency.

673
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,342
Get them to want to buy the stock.

674
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,303
Convince them it's something
they need, you know what I mean?

675
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,554
And that's the thing.

676
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,139
All nuns are lesbians.

677
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,141
What the fuck
are you talking about, Otter?

678
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,019
Think about it. They can't keep a dude
so they're gonna start fucking chicks.

679
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:15,229
Four fucking times, Kimmie! Four times.

680
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,772
- He's not with us.
- Friggin' Rambo.

681
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,191
Now she runs.

682
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:21,152
But look. I knew these guys
weren't like Harvard MBAs.

683
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:25,156
Robbie Feinberg, the pinhead,
took five years to finish high school.

684
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,159
Alden Kupferberg, the Sea Otter,
didn't even graduate.

685
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:32,497
Chester Ming, the depraved Chinaman,
thought jujitsu was in Israel.

686
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:35,041
Smartest of the bunch
was Nicky Koskoff.

687
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,792
He actually went to law school.

688
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:40,296
I called him Rugrat
because of his piece of shit hairpiece.

689
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,217
Still, give them to me
young, hungry and stupid

690
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,345
and in no time, I'll make them rich.

691
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:50,598
Oh, my God.

692
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,141
Jordan, that...

693
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:53,559
You like it, baby?

694
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:55,394
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

695
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,897
They're not the biggest stones
in the world,

696
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,732
but I promise they're really high quality.

697
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,192
It's beautiful.

698
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,194
They're so beautiful.

699
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:04,779
Oh, boy.

700
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,280
What?

701
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,866
I know that look. What is it? Go ahead.

702
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:10,618
I don't know, it's... You know...

703
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,496
These stocks... These companies...

704
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,623
They're like crappy companies.

705
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:16,999
- Well, yeah.
- Okay.

706
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,459
Yeah, they're terrible.

707
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,004
Don't worry about it. I told you,
what I'm doing is completely legal.

708
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,172
Yeah, I know.

709
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:25,383
But they're not gonna make
anyone money though, right?

710
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,261
Well, sometimes they do,
sometimes they don't.

711
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:29,762
You know how it goes.

712
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,390
Wouldn't you feel better
if you sold that stuff to rich people

713
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:35,434
who can, like, afford
to lose all that money?

714
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:37,645
Of course.

715
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,856
But rich people don't buy penny stocks.

716
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:42,817
They just don't.

717
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,485
Why not?

718
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:49,657
Because they're too smart,
that's why not.

719
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,743
I mean, what person
with a college education

720
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,120
would trust this bunch of jerk-offs?

721
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,413
Hang up the phone.
Tell him you'll call him back.

722
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,581
I got five fucking grand
on the phone right now!

723
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,707
Hey!

724
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:00,751
But what if they didn't sound
like a bunch of jerk-offs?

725
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:04,088
What if I could teach them
how to sell to people with money?

726
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:05,673
Real money.

727
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,925
So I decided to reinvent the company.

728
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,636
Gentlemen, welcome

729
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,514
to Stratton Oakmont.

730
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:18,686
You schnooks will now be targeting
the wealthiest 1% of Americans.

731
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,813
We're talking about whales here.

732
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:22,773
Moby fucking Dicks.

733
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:27,069
And with this script,
which is now your new harpoon,

734
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,238
I'm gonna teach
each and every one of you

735
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,991
to be Captain fucking Ahab.

736
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,701
Get it? Huh?

737
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,161
Captain who?

738
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:36,662
Captain Ahab. From the fucking...

739
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,333
The book, motherfucker. From the book.

740
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,418
Turn your fucking brain on.

741
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,003
- Fuck you.
- Jesus fuck, Robbie.

742
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,922
Listen to me.
We're a new company with a new name.

743
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:50,176
A company that
our clients can believe in.

744
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,179
A company that our clients can trust.

745
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:57,808
A firm whose roots are
so deeply embedded into Wall Street

746
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:01,312
that our very founders
sailed over on the Mayflower

747
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,230
and chiseled the name
Stratton Oakmont

748
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,608
right into Plymouth fucking Rock!

749
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:06,984
You got it?

750
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,236
What we're gonna do is this.

751
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:14,492
First we pitch 'em Disney, AT&T, IBM,
blue chip stocks exclusively.

752
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,744
Companies these people know.

753
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,873
Once we've suckered them in,
we unload the dog shit.

754
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,669
The pink sheets, the penny stocks,
where we make the money.

755
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,921
50% commission, baby.

756
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,007
Now the key to making money
in a situation like this

757
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:33,094
is to position yourself now
before the settlement.

758
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:36,097
Because by the time you read about it
in The Wall Street Journal,

759
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,057
it's already too late.

760
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,267
Then you wait.

761
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,435
You wait.

762
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,105
And whoever speaks first loses.

763
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,358
Sorry...

764
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,943
I appreciate the call.

765
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:53,239
I really have to give this some thought
and talk to my wife about it.

766
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:54,657
Can I call you back?

767
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,033
They don't know, right?
They gotta think about it,

768
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:58,494
they gotta talk to their fucking wives,
or the fucking Tooth Fairy.

769
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,371
Point is, it doesn't matter
what the fuck they say.

770
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:03,958
The only real objection that they have
is that they don't trust you guys.

771
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,668
And why should they trust you?
I mean, look at you.

772
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,503
You're a bunch of fucking
sleazy salesmen, right?

773
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,297
So, what do you say?

774
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,551
You mean to tell me that if I put you in
at Union Carbide at seven

775
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,052
and took you out at 32...

776
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,722
Texas Instruments at 11
and took you out at 47...

777
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,266
U.S. Steel at 16, took you out at 41...

778
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,017
You wouldn't be saying
to me right now, "Chester,

779
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,894
"pick me up
a few thousand shares of Disney

780
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,105
"on the spot, right now. Come on."

781
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,523
Honestly, Kevin? Honestly? Seriously?

782
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,941
I don't know you.

783
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,318
You cold-called me.
You're a total stranger.

784
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,238
I am in complete agreement with you.
You don't know me, I don't know you.

785
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,949
Let me introduce myself to you.
My name is Alden Kupferberg.

786
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,367
- Robbie Feinberg.
- Chester Ming.

787
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,286
I'm Senior Vice President
at Stratton Oakmont...

788
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,787
...and I plan on being one of the...

789
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:44,165
...top brokers in my firm next year.

790
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,167
And I'm not gonna get there
by being wrong, Stanley.

791
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,252
I do wanna say that you sound like a...

792
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,087
You sound like a pretty sincere guy.

793
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:52,423
It's not gonna make you rich
and it's not gonna make you poor.

794
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,967
But what this trade will do is serve as...

795
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,303
...a benchmark for
future business, Kevin.

796
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,221
You feel comfortable
with me now, Scotty?

797
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,598
And then you'll know for sure

798
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,725
that you finally found
a broker on Wall Street

799
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,351
that you can trust,

800
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:08,022
and who can consistently
make you money.

801
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,523
Sound fair enough?

802
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,527
You know what... Yeah.

803
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,489
I gotta say, I'm pretty impressed.

804
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,325
What are you thinking?

805
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,493
Kevin.

806
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,953
You give me one shot here

807
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,664
on a blue chip stock like Kodak,

808
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,958
and believe me, Kevin,

809
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,544
the only problem you're gonna have

810
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,047
is that you didn't buy more.

811
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,715
Sound fair enough?

812
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:37,259
Shit. My...

813
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,807
My wife might divorce me, but...

814
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,058
Yeah, let's do it.

815
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,144
Excellent choice, Kevin.

816
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:49,063
How much do you
want to go for this time?

817
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:51,106
Let's do five... $5,000.

818
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,358
Can we try 8,000, Kevin?

819
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:53,776
All right. Let's do 10.

820
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,152
- Ten.
- You want to do that?

821
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:56,237
Excellent choice!

822
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:59,114
Kevin, let me lock in that trade right now
and get back to you in a few minutes

823
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,491
with an exact confirmation, Kevin.

824
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,160
And welcome to Stratton Oakmont.

825
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:05,412
Thanks, man. I'm gonna have a beer.

826
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,622
This is fun.

827
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,915
Take it easy, Kev.

828
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,917
Hey, thanks, Jordan. Thanks a...

829
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,586
Fuck that motherfucker!

830
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,547
That's what I'm talking about!

831
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,301
What a fucking idiot.

832
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:22,847
The one thing I know about
in this world is airlines.

833
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,308
And Cuchon Airlines
is the future of airlines.

834
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,518
Get in now or...

835
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,353
- I'm Nicky Koskoff...
- Chester Ming...

836
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,939
...and I'm a Senior Vice President
with Stratton Oakmont.

837
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:36,151
Judy, I am so, so, so sorry for your loss.

838
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,695
When did he pass?

839
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:38,779
Just say I'm wrong, right.

840
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:39,905
And the stock goes down
a couple points...

841
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,490
...and it makes you,
in the words of my grandfather,

842
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:44,368
God rest his soul, "A shit ton of money."

843
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,578
It's like getting in on fucking sunlight

844
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,288
before there was fucking sunlight.
You understand?

845
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:53,794
That's a very intelligent decision.

846
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,504
I'm gonna transfer you
to my sales associate.

847
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,464
Rhonda!

848
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,466
- Rhonda!
...put you through to Andrea.

849
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,176
Has anybody fucking seen Rhonda?

850
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,059
Everybody have a good week?

851
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,185
Yeah!

852
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,688
The end of the month.

853
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:23,908
And to celebrate with
our weekly act of debauchery,

854
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,743
I have offered
our lovely sales assistant,

855
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,745
Danielle Harrison, here,

856
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:31,582
$10,000 to shave her fucking head!

857
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,375
Yeah!

858
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,337
Yeah, you want this?

859
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,504
You want this?

860
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,007
Let's scalp her! Scalp her!

861
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,426
Let the scalping begin!

862
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,473
Scalp! Scalp! Scalp!

863
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:54,688
FYI, boys, Danielle has promised
to use this $10,000 for breast implants!

864
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:58,192
She's already got C cups,
but now she wants fucking double D's!

865
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,028
Is this a great fucking
company or what?

866
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:06,241
Is this the greatest company
in the world?

867
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:10,663
Donnie!

868
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,208
Blow the roof off this motherfucker!

869
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,446
Champagne?

870
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,828
Send in the stripees!

871
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:26,280
Mine!

872
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:44,965
Word about us spread
throughout Wall Street.

873
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,342
Even the places I didn't want it to.

874
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,021
It wasn't long before Forbes magazine,

875
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,899
the flagship of Wall Street,
called to do a profile on me.

876
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:05,277
Let me ask you, how do you see
the future for Stratton Oakmont?

877
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,528
One word?

878
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,741
Diversification.

879
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,117
Sounds good. Thank you so much.
I have more than enough.

880
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:13,202
- I appreciate your time.
- Fantastic.

881
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:14,286
Can we get a quick picture?

882
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,874
A total fucking hatchet job.

883
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,126
This conniving little twat! Look at this!

884
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:24,379
"The Wolf of Wall Street"
they call me. Look.

885
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:25,422
Your hair looks good.

886
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:26,924
- Well, my hair looks good.
- Yeah.

887
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:31,136
"Jordan Belfort, sounding like
a kind of twisted Robin Hood

888
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:33,847
"who takes from the rich
and gives to himself

889
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,724
"and his merry little band of brokers."

890
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:37,643
- Read that. Read it.
- Listen.

891
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:41,105
There is no such thing
as bad publicity, sweetheart.

892
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,689
Read the article, babe.

893
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,234
Jordan, you look great!
You're in a huge magazine.

894
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,902
Big fucking deal I look great.

895
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,530
Mr. Belfort! Can you
look at my resume, please?

896
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,532
Excuse me, excuse me, sir!

897
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,410
Calm the fuck down!

898
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,287
What the hell's all this?

899
00:40:57,497 --> 00:41:00,207
It's the Forbes article.
They all want to work for you now.

900
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,458
Hey! What did I say?

901
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:02,709
I'm just trying to be nice.

902
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,629
Hey, you want a job, you talk to me!

903
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,005
- Mr. Belfort!
- Give me one minute.

904
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,716
Forbes made me a superstar.

905
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:15,764
Every day, dozens of money-crazed
kids beat a path to my door.

906
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:19,768
If we hired 'em, they dropped
straight out of college overnight

907
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:23,981
and spent whatever allowance they had
on a new suit from our Stratton tailor.

908
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,607
Are you fucking serious right now?

909
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:29,778
I mean, we were literally
putting clothes on these kids' backs.

910
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,865
And here comes this jerk-off
sniffing around.

911
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:36,118
But, you know, every time
someone rises up in this world,

912
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:39,580
there's always gonna be
some asshole trying to drag him down.

913
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:44,918
Within months, we doubled in size,
moved to even bigger offices.

914
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,594
It was a madhouse.

915
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,262
A greed-fest,

916
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:59,266
with equal parts cocaine,
testosterone, and body fluids.

917
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:00,809
Yes!

918
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:05,439
It got so bad, I had to declare
the office a fuck-free zone

919
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,441
between the hours of 9:00 and 7:00.

920
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,194
But I'm telling you, even that didn't help.

921
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:13,322
Actually, the madness started
on our very first day,

922
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,865
when one of our brokers, Ben Jenner,

923
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,075
christened the elevator
by getting a blowjob

924
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,702
from a sales assistant.

925
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,662
Her name was Pam, and to her credit,

926
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:25,792
she did have this amazing technique,
with this wild twist and jerk motion.

927
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,294
About a month later,

928
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,296
Donnie and I decided
to double-team her

929
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,547
on a Saturday afternoon

930
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:33,383
while our wives were out
shopping for Christmas dresses.

931
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,052
Eventually, Ben married her,

932
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,596
which was pretty amazing
considering she blew

933
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,973
every single guy in the office.

934
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:43,310
Then he got depressed
and killed himself three years later.

935
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,856
Anyway, I hired my dad, Max,
to maintain order as the Enforcer.

936
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:49,608
Stratton's very own Gestapo.

937
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:54,488
We called him Mad Max
because of his hair-trigger temper,

938
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:58,492
which could be set off by something
as innocuous as a ringing telephone.

939
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:02,287
Who the fuck has the goddamn gall

940
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:04,998
to call this house on a Tuesday night?

941
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,251
God damn it!

942
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:08,377
You're gonna miss it!

943
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:10,295
Please, tell me something I don't know.

944
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,131
I wait all week for the fucking Equalizer

945
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:15,509
and they have to fucking... Hello.

946
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,302
But as soon as
he picked up the phone...

947
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:18,679
Gene. How are you, Gene?

948
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,722
...he'd affect this weird British accent.

949
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,016
Right-o, Gene, that'd be great.

950
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,309
Cheerio.

951
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:25,435
It was absolutely bizarre.

952
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,062
The fucking halfwit!

953
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,188
- He'd hang up...
- You missed it!

954
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:30,524
...and then he's Mad Max all over again.

955
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,650
Damn it!

956
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,944
All right, tell me what happened.
What happened?

957
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,154
Well, he discovered
it was the mother's sister.

958
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,656
Who's he? Who? Tell me who...

959
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,324
The main guy.
You know who the main...

960
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:40,492
The main guy...

961
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,911
It was his mother's sister.
She showed up dead.

962
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:45,956
Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know

963
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,708
everything we were doing at Stratton.

964
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,835
And then there's a big target and we...

965
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,878
They get launched at the target.
They stick.

966
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:54,089
There's a bull's-eye and
the bull's-eye's a dollar sign.

967
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,257
Whoever gets closer to the dollar sign

968
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,300
gets the most points.

969
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:58,593
I'm gonna throw the shit out
of this little fucking thing.

970
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,595
So if it gets hurt, what happens?

971
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,972
'Cause we're gonna get fucking nuts.

972
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,307
I don't think he's gonna get hurt.
They're like...

973
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,142
They got like superhuman strength.

974
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:06,435
I think he's gonna be fine.

975
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,478
You can't look him right in the eyes.

976
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:09,688
You can't look him in the eye?

977
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,440
That's a fact. I saw it on PBS.

978
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,400
They get confused
and their wires get crossed.

979
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,027
You gotta look at their chin.

980
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,153
Like it looks like I'm looking at you

981
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,237
but I'm looking at your chin.

982
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:19,489
I feel like you're addressing me
right now, but you're not, are you?

983
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,450
They're like the Mona Lisa.
They find eye contact,

984
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:23,076
like, wherever you are
standing in the room.

985
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:24,369
And they lock in.

986
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,080
No, but there is a limit
to what we can do with them?

987
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,290
We're allowed to throw shit at 'em.

988
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,791
We're allowed to throw food? Bananas.

989
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,335
Any food. Correct.

990
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,461
But, for example, what I wouldn't do is

991
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:34,296
maybe like tell him to pull his cock out

992
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,089
and like get some
of the girls to, you know,

993
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,257
fondle him and shit like that.

994
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:38,342
That would be... That's unacceptable?

995
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:39,426
Let's keep that in our back pocket.

996
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,511
This guy is more about
throwing at the dartboard.

997
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:42,596
Correct. Yes, yes, yes.

998
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:44,056
The thing is, this is their gift, okay.

999
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,183
They're built to be thrown
like a lawn dart.

1000
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:47,476
They're top heavy like a lawn dart.

1001
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,560
So they're built for accuracy.

1002
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,604
Oh, my God. Can we bowl with this guy?

1003
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:51,772
That's his fucking brother, Rob.

1004
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,190
His brother's the bowling ball.

1005
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:54,983
The brother, you put
a skateboard on him,

1006
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:56,360
you strap him to a skateboard,

1007
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:57,819
you toss him down
an alley at some pins.

1008
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:59,529
- No shit. That's interesting.
- Swear to fucking God.

1009
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,615
- Can we get that guy?
- Yeah, we'll get that guy, too.

1010
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,784
But it says here this guy
will show his cock. Yeah.

1011
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,118
- Instead of growing up. Yeah.
- He will?

1012
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,495
They are very ornery by the way,

1013
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:07,954
so you gotta be very careful
with these little guys.

1014
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,081
Safety first.

1015
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:10,248
Safety is first, all right?

1016
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,209
I want somebody with
a fucking tranquilizer gun

1017
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:13,919
ready to knock this fucker out.

1018
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,171
- Do we want to get like a...
- Mace. Taser guns.

1019
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,255
A pellet gun maybe?

1020
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,465
No, a pellet gun is gonna hurt him.

1021
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,883
I just want him out. Knocked out cold.

1022
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,552
But I say we stick with the loophole.
Right? Okay?

1023
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:24,554
If we don't consider him a human,

1024
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,765
we just consider it an act,
I think we're in the clear.

1025
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:27,891
Like The Flying Wallendas.

1026
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,935
You know, a lot of those guys died
but they never sued anybody.

1027
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:31,770
The important thing
you guys gotta keep in mind

1028
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,688
is that these things gossip.

1029
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,399
They get together and they gossip.

1030
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:36,858
- That's a good point.
- And the last thing

1031
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:39,111
that we need is them
getting together and saying,

1032
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:40,779
"Oh, they made fun of us."

1033
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,447
Like, it's gonna make Stratton look bad.

1034
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:44,616
That's why I love you.
You think of shit like that.

1035
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,702
When they come in,
we treat it just like one of us. Okay?

1036
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:51,081
One of us. Gooble gobble, one of us.

1037
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:52,749
We accept them, one of us!

1038
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,543
Gooble gobble, one of us.

1039
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:55,961
We accept them, one of us.

1040
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,087
Gooble gobble, one of us!

1041
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,463
Jordan! Your dad's coming.

1042
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:00,006
Something about
the American Express bill.

1043
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,258
Can you get him out of here?

1044
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:02,509
Yeah. Lick my twat.

1045
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:03,844
No, I'm serious!

1046
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:06,263
Fuck. Guys, act like we're working.

1047
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:07,806
You got any fucking stock forms?

1048
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:09,433
He's coming, he's coming.

1049
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:10,684
Make some shit up.

1050
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:12,769
I think if we short Pfizer...

1051
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:17,774
$430,000 in one month, Jordy, huh?

1052
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:23,196
Four hundred and fucking 30,000
fucking dollars in one fucking month!

1053
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,449
Good morning.
They're business expenses. Relax.

1054
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:26,741
- Business expenses?
- Yes.

1055
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,243
- Jordy, look what you got here.
- What?

1056
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:32,205
Look at this. $26,000
for one fucking dinner!

1057
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,999
Okay. No, no. This could be explained.

1058
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,501
Dad, we had clients. The Pfizer clients.

1059
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,462
Right. The porterhouse from Argentina.

1060
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,797
Expensive champagne and...
We had to buy champagne.

1061
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:42,382
And you ordered all the fucking sides.

1062
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,426
- Tell him about the sides.
- I ordered sides, so...

1063
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,971
Sides? $26,000 worth of sides?

1064
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:50,390
What are these sides?
They cure cancer?

1065
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,350
The sides did cure cancer.
That's the problem.

1066
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:53,852
That's why they were expensive.

1067
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,854
- Shut the fuck up.
- I'm serious.

1068
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:57,939
- Stop.
- And EJ Entertainment?

1069
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,816
What the fuck is EJ Entertainment?

1070
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:02,652
Well, that's...

1071
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:03,820
Yeah, Jordy, what's EJ Entertainment?

1072
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:04,988
How do I describe this?

1073
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,072
Jord, what is that?

1074
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,241
- It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy!
- I know.

1075
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,410
- That's what it is!
- That is what it is.

1076
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,496
Isn't that the perfect description for it?

1077
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,165
That is what it is.
But none of these were charged to me.

1078
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,583
This is all of them.

1079
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:18,460
- Oh, that was all us?
- It wasn't me though.

1080
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,378
Fucking explain this shit to him!

1081
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,423
These are all of your
fucking charges right here!

1082
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,675
The IRS, they allow for T&A. It's fine.

1083
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,094
T&E!

1084
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,221
Yeah. I said T&E.

1085
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:30,597
- No, no. You said T&A.
- No, I didn't.

1086
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,681
Yeah, you did.

1087
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,059
- When did I say that?
- You said T&A. It's T&E.

1088
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,435
I know you're upset about the dinner,

1089
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,814
and that makes sense because we did
spend too much money. But I said T&E.

1090
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,525
Don't tell me what you said.
I heard what you said.

1091
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:42,901
- Dad. He said T&A.
- He did?

1092
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,361
Absolutely, no question.

1093
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:45,570
I'm trying to...

1094
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:46,696
I'm getting this close!

1095
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:47,989
- Dad, relax.
- I'm getting this close.

1096
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:50,534
That's what I'm saying.
I want you to open up more, Max.

1097
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:51,660
He's gonna fucking kill you.

1098
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,286
Why do you hold it in? Why do you...

1099
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:55,080
Max, why do you hold it in?

1100
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:56,873
That's it. Get the fuck out of here!

1101
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,292
- No, no, no!
- Asshole, get out of here.

1102
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,461
What kind of hooker takes credit cards?

1103
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:02,587
A rich one.

1104
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:05,006
At Stratton, there were
three kinds of hookers.

1105
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:07,384
The Blue Chips, top of
the line, model material.

1106
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:08,969
They cost between $300 and $500

1107
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,846
and you had to wear a condom
unless you gave them a hefty tip,

1108
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,807
which, of course, I always did.

1109
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:17,519
Then came the NASDAQs,
who were pretty, not great.

1110
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,938
They cost between 200 and 300 bucks.

1111
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,482
Finally, there were
the Pink Sheets. Skanks.

1112
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,485
They cost about 100 or less.
If you didn't wear a condom,

1113
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:26,820
you'd have to get a penicillin shot

1114
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,281
the next day
and pray your dick didn't fall off.

1115
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,199
Not that we didn't fuck them, too.

1116
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,118
Believe me, we did.

1117
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:35,996
It's that slipped disc thing again.

1118
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,498
I know what it is. You know, too much...

1119
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,333
...with EJ Entertainment.

1120
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,418
Pops.

1121
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:42,836
How are things at home?

1122
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:44,504
Well, not the best.

1123
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,132
She just doesn't...
You know what I'm saying?

1124
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:48,717
It's like the smell...

1125
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:50,385
There's a smell,
there's an attraction thing.

1126
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:53,054
After a while it kind of
fades away a little bit.

1127
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,806
Yeah, well. It's supposed to fade away.

1128
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,808
- Supposed to?
- That's marriage. You know...

1129
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,519
Your mother and I, we've been
married a long, long time.

1130
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:00,770
What do you think? We're...

1131
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,689
We're jumping into bed
every two minutes?

1132
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,149
- It doesn't work that way.
- I love her to death.

1133
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,401
I want to stay married, Dad, but...

1134
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:07,819
It's crazy out there.

1135
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,404
Some of these girls...
You should see them.

1136
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,739
Oh, my God!

1137
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:12,449
They're fucking...

1138
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,409
The things they're doing now, Pops.

1139
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:16,828
I mean... I mean, it's on
a whole other level.

1140
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,496
- Really?
- And they're all shaved, too.

1141
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,040
- Get out of here!
- All shaven.

1142
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,541
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.

1143
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,835
- Bald as a china doll.
- No bush?

1144
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,920
- No bush.
- Oh, my God!

1145
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:29,633
All of a sudden, one week, nobody
had anything down there anymore.

1146
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:30,800
It's a new world.

1147
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,802
They're bald from the eyebrows down.

1148
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,347
- Wow.
- Nothing. Not a stitch. It's like lasers.

1149
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:36,765
Wow. A new world.

1150
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,893
I was born too... Too early.

1151
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,187
I've never been a fan
of the bush, to be honest.

1152
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,605
- Really?
- Yeah.

1153
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:44,773
I don't mind it.

1154
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:46,274
Dad.

1155
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,735
I don't want you stressing out
about any of this.

1156
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:50,070
How can I not get stressed out?

1157
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,529
Look at the knuckleheads
you got working for you.

1158
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:52,822
I know they're knuckleheads

1159
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:55,116
but I need them to want
to live like me, you get it?

1160
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,576
To live like me.

1161
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,036
Jordy.

1162
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:01,873
One of these days, the chickens
are gonna come home to roost.

1163
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,669
You're looking at me like I'm crazy.

1164
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:09,130
Crazy? This is obscene.

1165
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:10,757
It was obscene.

1166
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:12,467
In the normal world.

1167
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:14,969
But who the fuck wanted to live there?

1168
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,807
Go party your fucking cocks off!

1169
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:25,772
We are about to become
fucking legends

1170
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:27,732
on Wall Street!

1171
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:32,320
We got plans up here
that's gonna take this company

1172
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:35,365
into the fucking stratosphere!

1173
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,120
Wolfie! Wolfie!

1174
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:45,917
Fuck Merrill Lynch. Fuck them.

1175
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:48,545
Why should they be taking all our
fucking money all the fucking time?

1176
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:49,796
This way we become the underwriters.

1177
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,423
It was our next big move.

1178
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:55,093
Finding companies to take public. IPOs.

1179
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,970
It was the only way
these Wall Street pricks

1180
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:00,765
would ever stop thinking of us
as some shitkicker bucket shop.

1181
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,058
We got Arncliffe International.

1182
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:03,685
See, we were a little different.

1183
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:07,355
We liked to get as fucked up as
possible during our business powwows

1184
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,899
in order to stimulate
our free-flowing ideas,

1185
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:12,986
which is why we were popping
these ludes like they were M&M's.

1186
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:15,155
Steve Madden.

1187
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:17,824
We own the fucking companies...

1188
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:19,701
We own the companies...

1189
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,703
Don't know what a lude is? I'll tell you.

1190
00:51:21,871 --> 00:51:23,830
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1191
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:28,668
Looks like those ludes are working
their magic on Donnie right now.

1192
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:03,453
The Quaalude,

1193
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:06,456
or lude, as it is commonly referred to,

1194
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,042
was first synthesized in 1951

1195
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,795
by an Indian doctor,
that's dots, not feathers,

1196
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,296
as a sedative,

1197
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,217
and was prescribed to stressed-out
housewives with sleep disorders.

1198
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,136
But pretty soon someone figured out

1199
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:23,973
that if you resisted the urge to sleep
for just 15 minutes,

1200
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,392
you got a pretty kick-ass high from it.

1201
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:30,396
Didn't take long for people
to start abusing ludes, of course.

1202
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:33,650
And in 1982,
the U.S. government Schedule 1'd them.

1203
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,902
Along with the rest of the world.

1204
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:39,280
Which meant there was
only a finite amount of these things left.

1205
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,325
No shit, you can't
even buy 'em anymore.

1206
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,911
You people are all shit out of luck.

1207
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,496
What are you saying? What is it?

1208
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,749
Steve Madden.

1209
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,377
Steve.

1210
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,128
You remember those ads?

1211
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:56,589
Those giant-headed girls
with the bug eyes

1212
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,299
wearing those big clunky shoes?

1213
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:00,593
My friend from school, Steve Madden.

1214
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,053
His friend from school, Steve Madden.

1215
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,931
Steve Madden was the name
in women's shoes at the moment.

1216
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,726
And all of Wall Street was
begging to take his company public.

1217
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,061
Go ahead, go ahead, what is it?

1218
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,437
Except, guess who grew up with him?

1219
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,314
- Women's shoes.
- Women's shoes.

1220
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:15,942
My very own Vice President.

1221
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:17,610
Women's shoes!

1222
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,779
Diamond Donnie Azoff.

1223
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:22,448
- Steve Madden.
- Steve.

1224
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:23,867
Steve.

1225
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,034
Hey, JB, JB, JB, JB.

1226
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,286
You gotta come check
this fucking chick out.

1227
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,121
Look at this. Look.

1228
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:36,087
I would fuck that girl
if she was my sister.

1229
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,631
I would let that girl
give me fucking AIDS.

1230
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,426
You want to see the Wolf handle this?

1231
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:44,888
She's hot.

1232
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:46,723
Cristy.

1233
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:53,688
Jordan, this is my friend Naomi.

1234
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:56,357
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Naomi.

1235
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:57,984
Naomi, nice to meet you.

1236
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,819
You got an awesome place here.

1237
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,238
I've don't think I've ever been
in a house this big before.

1238
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:03,489
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1239
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:04,782
Beautiful beach out there.

1240
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,034
Blair Hollingsworth.

1241
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,328
Hi, Blair. Nice to meet you.

1242
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:10,038
- Your name's Blair, right?
- Yeah.

1243
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,414
You like to Jet Ski?

1244
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,082
I've never done it before.

1245
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,167
You've never Jet Ski'd in your life?

1246
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,251
No, I've never Jet Ski'd.

1247
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:16,753
You've never been on a Jet Ski?

1248
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:18,004
How many times
are you gonna ask her?

1249
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,464
She's never been on a Jet Ski.

1250
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:22,175
I don't know.
Might ask her a couple more times.

1251
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:24,844
Okay. Sure.

1252
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:27,764
Hi. I'm Hildy. Nice to meet you.

1253
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,849
- Hi.
- Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

1254
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,351
Yeah, I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

1255
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:32,769
Just tell her I'll be
out in a couple of minutes.

1256
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,312
Why don't you tell your wife that?

1257
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,396
I might do that, but I'm having

1258
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:37,023
- a conversation right now.
- What am I, your secretary?

1259
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,942
You know what,
I think we should get going.

1260
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,193
Wait, wait. Where you guys going?

1261
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,736
We gotta go.
We got two other parties to go to.

1262
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,488
- We can stay for a drink.
- Yeah, stay for a drink.

1263
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,865
No. We got two other parties
we're supposed to get to.

1264
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,116
But we can stay for a drink...

1265
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:48,368
She's

1266
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:50,203
perfect.

1267
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:51,829
- You like champagne?
- I do.

1268
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:52,956
She's perfect.

1269
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,415
Donnie, what the fuck are you doing?

1270
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,209
You piece of...

1271
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,511
You're gonna have
to excuse my friend. He gets...

1272
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:07,971
Get the fuck out!

1273
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:10,098
Jordan, you gotta fuck her, bro.
She's so hot!

1274
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:11,265
Yeah, Donnie!

1275
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,352
Let him fucking finish, Hildy.

1276
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:16,062
That's fucking rude.

1277
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,981
Have some fucking manners.

1278
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,945
So, Bay Ridge,
that's near Staten Island, right?

1279
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:26,364
Brooklyn, across the Verrazano Bridge.

1280
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:28,032
Saturday Night Fever territory.

1281
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,659
That's right. Guinea Gulch.

1282
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,036
We call the Verrazano Bridge
the Guinea Gangplank.

1283
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:33,204
Right.

1284
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:34,914
So I presume you're Italian?

1285
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:36,207
On my dad's side.

1286
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,502
I'm also Dutch, German, English.

1287
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,087
I'm a mutt.

1288
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:42,588
Yeah. You're a mutt.

1289
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,008
Yeah, I still have family
over there though, in London.

1290
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:47,802
My Aunt Emma. She's the best.

1291
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:50,847
Very British, you know.
She's a classy lady.

1292
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:52,265
That explains it then.

1293
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,349
Explains what?

1294
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:56,227
It explains you. I mean,
you're a duchess, right?

1295
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,730
The Duchess of Bay Ridge.

1296
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:02,859
Excuse me.

1297
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:04,944
Could I get a straw, please?

1298
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,572
Thank you.

1299
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:15,830
So I was a little surprised
you asked Cristy for my number.

1300
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,166
Why is that?

1301
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,878
Aren't you married?

1302
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,423
Well... Yeah, but what?

1303
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,592
Married people can't have friends?

1304
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,262
We're gonna be friends?

1305
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:35,558
Yeah. You don't want to be my friend?

1306
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:41,731
We're not gonna be friends.

1307
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,450
And at night I work on my designs.

1308
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,244
I have an entire line of lingerie.

1309
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:58,206
You know, camisoles, bustiers, panties.

1310
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,626
She designs women's panties, too?

1311
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,419
Oh, my God!

1312
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,390
Come on, Jordan, think of a way
to get up to her apartment.

1313
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:23,981
You wanna come up for
some tea or something?

1314
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,943
Tea? Yeah.

1315
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:28,945
- Like hot tea?
- Yeah.

1316
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,321
Oh, yeah. That sounds nice. Yeah.

1317
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:32,698
Tea. Fuck, yeah, I wanted
to come up for tea.

1318
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,743
Like Darjeeling or rose hip,
something nice like that?

1319
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:36,953
Sure.

1320
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:38,371
This is Rocky.

1321
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,665
Oh, who's this? Say hi, Rocky.

1322
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:41,999
Hi, sweetheart.

1323
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,376
Okay.

1324
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:46,546
Why don't you light a fire or something
and I'll be right out.

1325
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:48,923
- Yeah. Fire, here?
- Sure.

1326
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:53,886
I like your painting here. It's...

1327
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,646
God, help me. How do I fuck this girl?

1328
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,276
You all right?

1329
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,695
Yeah, yeah. Just trying
to light the fire here.

1330
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,910
That's it. That's it, you're leaving.

1331
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:19,871
Don't get involved.
Go home to your wife.

1332
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,674
As you can probably guess,

1333
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,302
I fucked her goddamn brains out...

1334
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,137
Jesus Lord!

1335
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:40,600
For 11 seconds.

1336
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:52,987
Did you just come?

1337
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:55,031
Oh, yeah, I just came.

1338
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,408
Did you? Did you come?

1339
00:58:57,618 --> 00:58:59,202
- No.
- No?

1340
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:00,369
Okay.

1341
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,622
I'm still hard so just give me a sec.

1342
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,124
Sure.

1343
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:07,043
Come on, baby, come on.

1344
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,756
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1345
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:19,013
Oh, God!

1346
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:21,015
Fuck off, Rocky! Bad dog.

1347
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:22,516
You have a biscuit
or something like that?

1348
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:23,684
It's okay.

1349
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,228
- Just keep going.
- Rocky, go play.

1350
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:27,188
Go play, Rocky. Go, go, go, go.

1351
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:31,067
You're crazy.

1352
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:32,401
I couldn't get enough.

1353
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:34,820
I mean, her pussy
was like heroin to me.

1354
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:37,657
And it wasn't just about the sex, either.

1355
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,742
Naomi and I got along. I mean, we...

1356
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,661
We had similar interests and shit.

1357
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,626
Choo-choo train.

1358
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,002
Yeah.

1359
00:59:57,177 --> 01:00:00,888
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.

1360
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:10,189
Yeah, yeah.
Let's toke it all on there, huh?

1361
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,401
Oh, shit!

1362
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:25,162
You!

1363
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:27,290
Get out of the fucking car!

1364
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:28,708
Jesus Christ.

1365
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:31,377
Son of a bitch! Oh, fuck!

1366
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,463
Relax, sweetheart. Relax.

1367
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,258
- Son of a fucking bitch!
- Okay, okay... Geez!

1368
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:38,634
Okay, babe, stop!

1369
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:39,844
Please.

1370
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:41,012
Bitch!

1371
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:43,389
- What are you doing...
- That whore from the party?

1372
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,974
Jesus Christ!

1373
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,142
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1374
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:47,476
I thought you were at the fucking beach!

1375
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,894
I didn't know you were here!

1376
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,521
That's where you've fucking been?

1377
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:52,315
With that fucking whore from the party?

1378
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:53,816
I thought you were at the beach house.

1379
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,276
How could you do this to me?

1380
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,154
- Sweetie, come on...
- Who the fuck are you, Jordan?

1381
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:00,990
You're like a completely
different fucking person!

1382
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:04,201
I made a mistake.
I don't know what to tell you, babe. I...

1383
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:05,911
I'm sorry.

1384
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,873
- I'm sorry.
- Is that who... Is that what you want?

1385
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:20,426
Do you love her?

1386
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,558
Answer me.

1387
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:51,207
I felt horrible.

1388
01:01:52,084 --> 01:01:54,043
Three days later, I filed for a divorce

1389
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,878
and moved Naomi into the apartment.

1390
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:03,886
Say what you will,
but the Duchess did have style.

1391
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:07,098
She brought in a decorator,
feng shui'd the whole place.

1392
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:09,558
She even hired a gay butler.

1393
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:12,228
This guy was smart,
sophisticated, professional.

1394
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:13,896
Really, really great.

1395
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,314
Is that jasmine?

1396
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,317
Yes, sir. I tried to stump you
this evening. Very good.

1397
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:20,277
Very good. Great nose.

1398
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:22,029
Except for that one time.

1399
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,702
Oh, my God!

1400
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,664
Oh, hey.

1401
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:33,416
Is it Wednesday already?

1402
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:35,626
Oh, don't stop.

1403
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:36,794
What the fuck!

1404
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:39,004
That is fucked up!

1405
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:40,673
He must have thought we were still

1406
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,341
at the Hamptons
this weekend, you know.

1407
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:43,801
Where were they doing it,
sweetheart? In the bedroom?

1408
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:46,554
They were everywhere. There were
two guys over there on the table.

1409
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:47,888
There were more over here.

1410
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,432
There were four right here.

1411
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:51,183
Are you fucking serious? Right there?

1412
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:54,103
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Oh, baby, it gets worse.

1413
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:58,149
After they left, I checked the apartment.

1414
01:02:58,275 --> 01:02:59,358
Right. What?

1415
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:01,527
What is it, babe? What?

1416
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:02,945
Where's my money?

1417
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,029
I don't know where your money...

1418
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:06,115
Where is my fucking money?
Where is it?

1419
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,159
I don't know where
your money is, Mr. Belfort.

1420
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:10,494
- I didn't do anything.
- If you don't get...

1421
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:11,871
He's lying through his fucking teeth.

1422
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:13,122
Let's start from the beginning.

1423
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,457
Let's start from the beginning, all right?

1424
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,083
You invited some friends over, right?

1425
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:18,043
One thing led to another.
Things got out of hand.

1426
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:19,628
We understand that, we do.

1427
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:22,131
We do blow all the time.
We're fucking degenerates ourselves.

1428
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,299
Look at us, right?

1429
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:24,967
But money was stolen
from my apartment.

1430
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,635
Right from my sock drawer. All right?

1431
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,804
Like I said, I don't know
where your money is.

1432
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:30,264
Just start from the beginning.
Who came over?

1433
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,390
It was just a normal day.

1434
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:32,808
I knew you were coming home
the next day.

1435
01:03:32,893 --> 01:03:35,144
So everything would be fine.
It'd be cleaned up.

1436
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,146
I got a little high at breakfast.

1437
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,023
So I got a little happy. I had some eggs,

1438
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:40,107
I had a little bit of ice cream.

1439
01:03:40,192 --> 01:03:42,026
And then I said,
"Who do I know that likes ice cream?"

1440
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,569
It's my friend, Rudy. So I called Rudy.

1441
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,113
- Who's Rudy?
- Yeah, who's Rudy?

1442
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:50,993
- You know who Rudy is. Come on.
- Me? I don't...

1443
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,203
- You know...
- Who the fuck is Rudy?

1444
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:53,329
I don't know anyone named Rudy.

1445
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:54,497
Last month. The Lollipop Club.

1446
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:56,040
You know who Rudy was. Dancing...

1447
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:57,541
You know who Rudy is?

1448
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,628
I don't fucking know any...

1449
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:01,670
What do you mean?

1450
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:02,838
So he went to The Lollipop Club?

1451
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:04,507
Oh, he was
at The Lollipop Club for sure.

1452
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:06,175
On the stage, grinding with everybody.

1453
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,260
I got fucked up. I like to dance.

1454
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,887
I don't know.
Maybe I met him, maybe I didn't.

1455
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:11,597
I meet a lot of fucking people.

1456
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,349
- What are you saying?
- $50,000 was stolen

1457
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:14,642
from my fucking sock drawer!

1458
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:16,227
All my girlfriend's jewelry is gone.

1459
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:18,229
- Where the fuck is it?
...Rudy. What the fuck?

1460
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:20,356
Did your fucking little faggot
friend Rudy take my shit?

1461
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,107
Did he? Answer me!

1462
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:24,693
Okay. Now I get it. Now I get why I'm...

1463
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:25,986
This is a gay thing.

1464
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:27,655
See, all of you...

1465
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,281
You think this is 'cause you're a fag?

1466
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:31,408
My cousin's a fucking faggot.

1467
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:33,869
And I go on vacation with him
and his boyfriend. I love fags.

1468
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:35,079
You were in charge, right?

1469
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,872
I will not be stolen from. You get that?

1470
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:39,124
I fucking like gay people. I don't like you.

1471
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,835
He should've hired a fucking Mexican
like I have in my fucking house.

1472
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,047
Shit! What the fuck...

1473
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,636
Talk, you fuck, talk!

1474
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,845
I'm gonna drop you, you faggot!

1475
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,097
Where is it?

1476
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:56,308
Chester and Toby,
they went all yakuza on Nicholas.

1477
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:57,476
You know, they got crazy.

1478
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:58,602
I don't know!

1479
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:02,314
I had to call the cops just to keep
them from killing the poor guy.

1480
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,026
I gave them each 1,000 bucks
and told them what Nicholas had done.

1481
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,695
Then they kicked his ass.

1482
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:09,530
Thanks again, Officer.

1483
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:12,533
It's not like I cared about
the 50 grand anyway.

1484
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:14,243
I was making that much
almost every day

1485
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,579
through one rathole or another.

1486
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:19,415
Now a rathole is a friend,
like Brad here,

1487
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:22,042
who held stock in his name for me.

1488
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,378
Who are you supposed to be, huh?
Jack Nickle-Jew?

1489
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:29,258
I'd drive the price up then he'd sell
and kick most of the profits back to...

1490
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,176
You guessed it, me.

1491
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,473
All cash. None of it's on the books.

1492
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:38,851
A big no-no, of course,
in the eyes of the law.

1493
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:42,855
Enter our new securities
attorney, Manny Riskin.

1494
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,609
700 bucks an hour
to be the voice of doom.

1495
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:48,444
Listen to me. You piss up the SEC's leg,

1496
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:49,737
you end up with your tits in a ringer.

1497
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:52,823
Do not worry about it.
I have the SEC under control.

1498
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,659
What the fuck
are these imbeciles doing?

1499
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,119
Hey! Hey!

1500
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,495
What are you doing? Hey!

1501
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,539
We got the SEC in here.

1502
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:02,708
The Securities
and Exchange Commission

1503
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:05,377
sent two lawyers down
to review our files.

1504
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,379
So I set them up in our conference room

1505
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,547
and I had it bugged

1506
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:10,841
and the air conditioning
turned up so high

1507
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,468
that it felt like Antarctica in there.

1508
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:14,511
Is it always this cold in here?

1509
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:15,638
I don't know.

1510
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:16,889
Then, while they were looking

1511
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,390
for a smoking gun in that room...

1512
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:20,267
Arncliffe International is on fire.

1513
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,604
...I was gonna fire off a bazooka in here,

1514
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:25,939
offering up our latest IPO.

1515
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:28,525
An IPO is an initial public offering.

1516
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:32,363
It's the first time a stock is offered
for sale to the general population.

1517
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:34,323
Now, as the firm taking
the company public,

1518
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,075
we set the initial sales price

1519
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,911
then sold those shares
right back to our friends. The...

1520
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:40,621
Look.

1521
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:42,581
I know you're not following
what I'm saying anyway, right?

1522
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:44,625
That's okay. That doesn't matter.

1523
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:46,543
The real question is this.

1524
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:48,504
"Was all this legal?"

1525
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:50,464
Absolutely fucking not.

1526
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,258
But we were making more money
than we knew what to do with.

1527
01:06:57,639 --> 01:06:58,764
And what do you do when you're making

1528
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,307
more money
than you know what to do with?

1529
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:07,731
Oh, my God!

1530
01:07:08,108 --> 01:07:09,775
Will you marry me?

1531
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:11,652
Oh, my God.

1532
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,737
Is that a yes?

1533
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:15,489
Are you sure?

1534
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:17,449
Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure.

1535
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,493
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1536
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:33,382
I held my bachelor party
at the Mirage in Las Vegas.

1537
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:35,843
The flight there alone was a bacchanal.

1538
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:40,055
One last blowout for the gods
before I settled down for good.

1539
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:41,890
A hundred Strattonites,

1540
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:44,768
50 hookers, plus 50 more waiting
once we landed.

1541
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:46,478
Oh, and the drugs.

1542
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:50,399
I mean, I tell you, our plane was
like a pharmacy with wings.

1543
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:23,182
All told, the weekend
cost me two million bucks,

1544
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:28,270
including the cost
of refurbishing the entire 28th floor.

1545
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,190
...kiss the bride.

1546
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:36,236
But the wedding
was something out of a fairy tale.

1547
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:39,406
With Naomi, my Duchess,

1548
01:08:39,491 --> 01:08:40,991
me, her handsome Duke,

1549
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:44,119
and The Bahamas Ocean Club,
our castle.

1550
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,841
Of course, after the bachelor party,
me, the Duke,

1551
01:08:57,926 --> 01:09:00,677
needed a few penicillin shots
so he could

1552
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:02,888
safely consummate the marriage.

1553
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:10,062
Hey! Barry Kleinman,
filming the wedding.

1554
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,563
A few words for your son?

1555
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:14,316
Jordan. Remember what I told you.

1556
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,528
It involves your penis and her vagina.

1557
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:20,572
And you know, you know
what you can do, Jordy.

1558
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:39,383
Oh, my God!

1559
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:40,843
Aunt Emma?

1560
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,932
I can't believe you came!

1561
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:50,602
Jordan! Jordan! Look who came!

1562
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:52,437
It's Aunt Emma.

1563
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:54,606
Aunt Emma.

1564
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:57,067
- Oh, Jordan, dear, how lovely.
- Hey, how you doing?

1565
01:09:57,944 --> 01:10:00,612
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you in person.

1566
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,614
Into the donuts, I see.

1567
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:05,033
Oh, I... I...

1568
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:06,326
Well...

1569
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,454
I lived through the '60s, my dear.

1570
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:10,998
Enjoy the day.

1571
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:13,500
She surprised me. I didn't even know.

1572
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,349
Just one more step. Are you ready?

1573
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:31,018
- Where are we going?
- Keep your eyes closed.

1574
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:32,477
One, two, three!

1575
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:36,023
What is this?

1576
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:38,150
- It's your wedding present.
- What?

1577
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,568
It's your wedding present, sweetheart.

1578
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:42,404
What?

1579
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:44,990
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

1580
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,199
A fucking yacht?

1581
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:49,202
For millionaires
whose ships have come in,

1582
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:52,080
pricey pleasure boats
are for the most fun afloat.

1583
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:55,250
It's no coincidence that
its 150 feet of green hull

1584
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:57,502
is the color of cash. Anchors aweigh!

1585
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,838
Oh, my God! Baby!

1586
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:03,800
- I think you like it?
- You're crazy.

1587
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:05,302
- You like it?
- Yes!

1588
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:13,769
For three weeks, we sailed
the Naomi through the Caribbean,

1589
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:15,854
eventually taking her home
to Long Island,

1590
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:17,022
where we bought a house.

1591
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,691
Seven acres on
the Gold Coast of Long Island.

1592
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:22,277
The most expensive
real estate in the world.

1593
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:25,030
With maids, cooks, landscapers,
you name it.

1594
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:27,574
We even had two guards
who worked in shifts.

1595
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,742
Both named Rocco.

1596
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:34,957
It was heaven on earth.

1597
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,294
Wake up, you piece of shit!

1598
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:41,088
Who's Venice?

1599
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:42,506
- Huh?
- Who?

1600
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:43,590
Who? Who?

1601
01:11:43,675 --> 01:11:45,342
"Who?" What are you, a fucking owl?

1602
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:46,593
Who is she?

1603
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,136
Some little hooker
you were fucking last night?

1604
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:50,138
What the fuck are
you talking about? No.

1605
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:51,807
No way, baby, no!

1606
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:54,226
You were calling
her name in your sleep!

1607
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,937
Are you out of your
fucking mind? I don't...

1608
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,147
I don't even know who Venice is.

1609
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:01,441
What the fuck does that
even mean? Venice.

1610
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:04,277
That's the stupidest shit
I've ever heard in my fucking life!

1611
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:10,242
Venice...

1612
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,828
Venice, baby, where are you?

1613
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:17,040
Venice!

1614
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:18,834
Where'd you go?

1615
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:25,674
Oh, baby.
Oh, you're gonna play rough, huh?

1616
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:27,926
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- You like that?

1617
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:32,389
I like it. I like it.

1618
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:34,266
Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie.

1619
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,475
Wolfie?

1620
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,852
Yeah, it's my safe word, baby.
It's my safe word.

1621
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,353
I don't give a fuck about your safe word!

1622
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:40,522
- Come on!
- Shut the fuck up!

1623
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:42,983
Shut up, you little bitch!

1624
01:12:43,443 --> 01:12:45,569
You're a fucking dirty little birdy!

1625
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:48,655
That's right.

1626
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,032
That's right! I forgot.

1627
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:51,616
I forgot, baby.

1628
01:12:51,743 --> 01:12:56,038
Donnie and I were investing
in a condominium complex in Venice.

1629
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:57,247
That's why all this confusion.

1630
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:58,874
Oh, you're investing in Italy?

1631
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,667
Not Italy. California.

1632
01:13:00,752 --> 01:13:02,252
- Oh, California?
- Yeah.

1633
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:03,462
You're a lying piece of shit!

1634
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:04,713
Duchess, baby, come on.

1635
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:06,339
Don't you fucking "Duchess" me.

1636
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:07,883
Don't you "Duchess" me!

1637
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:11,094
Do you really think that
I don't know what you're up to?

1638
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,096
- You're a father now, Jordan.
- Yeah.

1639
01:13:13,181 --> 01:13:14,598
- You're a father now.
- I know...

1640
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:16,391
And you're still acting like an infant!

1641
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,352
God damn it!

1642
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:22,105
Baby, you know,
you got real anger issues.

1643
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:24,524
Who is the one who flew in here

1644
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:27,486
at 3:00 in the morning
on their stupid helicopter

1645
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:29,613
and woke up Skylar? That was you!

1646
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:32,324
Oh, Skylar! Oh, fucking bullshit!

1647
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:47,130
Does it even matter to you
that I just had that driving range

1648
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:50,425
sodded with Bermuda grass, Jordan,

1649
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:52,552
- and now you fucking wrecked it!
- Oh, my God... Bermuda grass.

1650
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,387
No, you didn't research the whole thing

1651
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:56,556
and deal with the fucking
golf course people!

1652
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:57,808
Oh, my God,

1653
01:13:57,892 --> 01:14:00,435
you had to deal
with the golf course people, too!

1654
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,188
What a Greek tragedy, honey!
Oh, my God!

1655
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:06,191
You probably had to pay them
in cash with your hands!

1656
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:07,484
What a fucking burden.

1657
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,528
And actually do some work
besides swiping

1658
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,738
my fucking credit card all day, huh?

1659
01:14:11,823 --> 01:14:14,533
Because I can't keep track
of your professions, honey.

1660
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:16,493
'Cause last month
you were a wine connoisseur.

1661
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:18,620
Now you're an aspiring
landscape architect!

1662
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:20,372
- Let me get that right... No!
- Fuck you!

1663
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,457
Don't fucking dare throw that

1664
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:25,001
fucking water at me.
Don't you fucking dare.

1665
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,379
All right, honey?

1666
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:28,964
Now will you just...

1667
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:30,924
We could talk this out, all right?

1668
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:33,385
We just use our words. You know?

1669
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,681
Come on, sweetheart.

1670
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,724
Talk to me. Talk to me.

1671
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:41,893
Stop flexing your muscles, Jordan.

1672
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,687
You look like a fucking imbecile.

1673
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:45,063
Babe, come on.

1674
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:48,316
You should feel happy
you got a husband

1675
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:50,652
who's in such great shape
like this, huh?

1676
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:52,696
Come here.

1677
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,322
Come on, give me a kiss.

1678
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:55,448
You look so beautiful right now.

1679
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:56,658
- Come on.
- Kiss you?

1680
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:57,909
- You look so beautiful...
- Kiss you?

1681
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:59,619
Yeah, give me one...

1682
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,913
Fuck you!

1683
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:03,999
Ah, yes, my morning ritual.

1684
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,459
First I'd get up and fight with Naomi

1685
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:08,753
about whatever it is
I did the night before.

1686
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:11,047
Next was a steam so I could sweat out

1687
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:12,883
the drugs still in my system.

1688
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:14,593
Then I'd assess the damage.

1689
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,595
Drown out my eyeballs.

1690
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:19,222
Take my "back pills"
to get the day started,

1691
01:15:19,307 --> 01:15:21,391
then seek to make up with Naomi.

1692
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:23,435
Good morning, Daddy.

1693
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,604
Where's my kiss?

1694
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:29,065
Hey, sweetheart.

1695
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,820
Does Daddy get a kiss from
both of his little girls, huh?

1696
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,280
Oh, no.

1697
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:38,450
No, Daddy doesn't even
get to touch Mommy

1698
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,285
for a very, very,

1699
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,120
very long time.

1700
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:45,415
Daddy's really sorry
about what he said in the other room.

1701
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:46,708
He didn't mean any of it.

1702
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:49,085
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

1703
01:15:49,629 --> 01:15:51,213
And from now on,

1704
01:15:52,632 --> 01:15:54,799
it's gonna be nothing but short,

1705
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:57,219
short skirts around the house.

1706
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:02,307
And you know something else, Daddy?

1707
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:09,397
Mommy is just so sick
and tired of wearing panties.

1708
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:13,151
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1709
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:16,947
In fact,

1710
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:21,701
she's decided to throw them

1711
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:24,996
all away.

1712
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:32,671
So take a good look, Daddy.

1713
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:36,132
You're gonna be seeing
an awful lot of this around the house.

1714
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:37,759
Oh, baby...

1715
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:39,302
Yeah, Mommy.

1716
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:41,721
- Yeah...
- But no touching.

1717
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:43,890
Oh, gosh.

1718
01:16:48,396 --> 01:16:50,105
What's wrong, Daddy?

1719
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:51,523
Baby.

1720
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:54,859
God!

1721
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:57,696
Look at this shit.

1722
01:16:57,822 --> 01:17:01,533
Okay. Mommy likes to
play games with Daddy.

1723
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:07,872
Mommy, have you ever noticed
anything odd about Mr...

1724
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:09,916
Mr. Fuzzy Bear over there?

1725
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:15,213
His eyes seem
to be a little bit odd, don't they?

1726
01:17:15,715 --> 01:17:19,175
Yeah, there's something
a little bit different about his eyes.

1727
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:22,470
Yes! I think it's true. Say "Hi," Mommy.

1728
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:24,389
Say "Hi" to Rocco and Rocco.

1729
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:25,807
Say "Hi." Hi, fellas.

1730
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:27,309
See that, huh?

1731
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:29,144
Of all the fucking days,

1732
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:30,979
she chooses today
to give me blue balls!

1733
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:34,149
I mean, today was
the biggest day in Stratton's history,

1734
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:36,067
and I needed to be thinking straight.

1735
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:37,569
Hey, Jordan!

1736
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:39,738
- Welcome.
- Steve here yet?

1737
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:42,949
This was the day that
we launched the Steve Madden IPO.

1738
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:45,160
Troops are all here,
everyone's all rallied, excited.

1739
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:47,037
Everything had to run tight.

1740
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:48,163
It had to be perfect.

1741
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:50,415
What the fuck is that kid doing?

1742
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,083
What's he doing?

1743
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:54,669
The biggest IPO in this firm's history.

1744
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:57,047
What the fuck is he doing?

1745
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,050
Is he... Is he wearing a bow tie?

1746
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:01,426
Hi.

1747
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:03,678
How're you doing?

1748
01:18:03,763 --> 01:18:04,763
Good.

1749
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,474
You cleaning the fish bowl?

1750
01:18:08,559 --> 01:18:10,643
I just... I had a minute and...

1751
01:18:11,062 --> 01:18:12,437
You had a minute.

1752
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:15,065
And today you needed
to clean the fish bowl? Today?

1753
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:18,818
I had finished my paperwork
and I had a couple of minutes.

1754
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:20,779
Okay. Nice to meet you.

1755
01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:28,036
On new issue day?

1756
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,290
On cocksucking,
motherfucking new issue day?

1757
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:33,583
This is what you do?

1758
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:36,544
Hey, everybody, listen up!

1759
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:39,798
This is what happens when you fuck
with your pets on new issue day!

1760
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,313
Take your little bow tie, get your shit,

1761
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:57,482
and get the fuck out of my office!
You understand?

1762
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,067
Get the fuck out!

1763
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,239
Everybody on point!

1764
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:07,242
We are here to make money.
Everybody on point.

1765
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:12,497
A real wolf pit,
which is exactly how I liked it.

1766
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,208
Jordan, look what I caught in the lobby.
I caught a genius.

1767
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:16,751
Enter Steve Madden.

1768
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:17,961
The great American cobbler.

1769
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:20,422
Red-hot ladies footwear impresario.

1770
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:24,092
And thanks to Donnie,
we were taking his company public.

1771
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:27,887
Stratton Oakmont was crawling out
of the primordial ooze.

1772
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,973
Pond scum no more.

1773
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:31,599
That's why they gotta see your face.

1774
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:34,144
You get them fired up so they push
the shit out of this stock. Okay?

1775
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:36,813
And not only that,
Donnie and I secretly owned

1776
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:39,190
85% of Steve Madden Shoes,

1777
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,776
which legally speaking was a big no-no,

1778
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:45,238
but we'd get filthy fucking rich
if our troops got behind it.

1779
01:19:45,573 --> 01:19:47,824
Our job was to get them worked up.

1780
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:49,701
But not too worked up.

1781
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,495
Hello. If...

1782
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:55,707
For those of you who don't know me...

1783
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,041
My name's Steve Madden.

1784
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:58,668
Yeah, we know who you are.

1785
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:00,253
Your name is on the box.

1786
01:20:00,463 --> 01:20:02,005
Get the shoes. Show them the shoes.

1787
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:03,673
- Show them the shoes.
- Okay. Yeah.

1788
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:06,968
Anyway, you know,
this shoe is pretty cool.

1789
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:09,888
This is the Mary Lou, which is really
the shoe that put me on the map.

1790
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,556
Without it, I wouldn't be here.

1791
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,807
It's a fat girls' shoe!

1792
01:20:12,892 --> 01:20:14,851
Believe it or not...
Believe it or not though,

1793
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:18,271
the Mary Lou is actually the same
as the Mary Jane, but it's black leather.

1794
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:24,611
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1795
01:20:24,695 --> 01:20:27,572
Fight back! Come on!
Where you at? Where you at?

1796
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,157
All right!

1797
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:32,494
Let's give it up for Steve Madden
and his awesome Mary Lou!

1798
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:34,746
Hold that up. Hold that up.
Hold that up proud!

1799
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,290
Give him a round of applause!

1800
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:40,627
You guys got that
out of your systems, huh?

1801
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:43,588
You having a good afternoon or what?

1802
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:47,175
I wanna take a moment
and tell you why Steve here is so

1803
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:49,552
absolutely off the fucking wall.

1804
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:54,349
It's because this man
is a creative genius.

1805
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:58,436
This ability, this gift that Steve has,

1806
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:01,856
it goes beyond just
spotting the hottest shoe trends.

1807
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:05,693
Steve's power is that he creates trends.

1808
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:07,445
You understand?

1809
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:09,739
Artists like Steve
come along once every decade.

1810
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:13,243
I'm talking Giorgio Armani,
Gianni Versace, Coco Chanel,

1811
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:14,953
Yves Saint Laurent.

1812
01:21:15,412 --> 01:21:17,038
Steve, come over here for a second.

1813
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,290
I don't think you all realize

1814
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:21,334
that Steve Madden

1815
01:21:21,669 --> 01:21:24,963
is the hottest person
in the women's shoe industry,

1816
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:26,339
with orders going through the roof

1817
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:29,759
at every department store
in North America right now.

1818
01:21:30,261 --> 01:21:32,262
We have him here in our office!

1819
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:36,099
We should thank
our fucking lucky stars this man is here!

1820
01:21:36,183 --> 01:21:38,768
We should be on our hands
and knees right now,

1821
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:40,937
getting ready to suck this guy off!

1822
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:43,565
Like this! Okay?

1823
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:45,441
I wanna suck you off, Steve!

1824
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:47,902
Everyone's gonna suck you off!

1825
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:49,779
This is our golden ticket

1826
01:21:49,989 --> 01:21:52,282
to the fucking chocolate
factory right here!

1827
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,325
And I wanna meet

1828
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,661
Willy fucking Wonka, okay?

1829
01:21:57,329 --> 01:22:00,164
I wanna be with the fucking
Oompa Loompas like this!

1830
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:06,671
All right, get off this fucking stage!
Get out of here.

1831
01:22:07,214 --> 01:22:09,549
All right, I want all of you
to focus for a second.

1832
01:22:10,092 --> 01:22:12,093
See those little black boxes?

1833
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:13,428
They're called telephones.

1834
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:16,264
I'm gonna let you in on a little
secret about these telephones.

1835
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:18,933
They're not gonna dial
themselves. Okay?

1836
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:22,770
Without you, they're just
worthless hunks of plastic.

1837
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:26,983
Like a loaded M16 without
a trained Marine to pull the trigger.

1838
01:22:28,027 --> 01:22:30,445
And in the case of the telephone,

1839
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:33,239
it's up to each and every one of you,

1840
01:22:34,742 --> 01:22:36,826
my highly-trained Strattonites.

1841
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,245
My killers!

1842
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:43,291
My killers, who will not
take no for an answer!

1843
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:45,752
My fucking warriors,

1844
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:48,212
who will not hang up the phone

1845
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:51,299
until their client either buys

1846
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:53,551
or fucking dies!

1847
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:10,109
Let me tell you something.

1848
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:13,196
There is no nobility in poverty.

1849
01:23:13,656 --> 01:23:16,658
I have been a rich man
and I have been a poor man.

1850
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:19,160
And I choose rich every fucking time.

1851
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:23,081
Because at least as a rich man,
when I have to face my problems,

1852
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:27,001
I show up in the back of a limo,
wearing a $2,000 suit

1853
01:23:27,086 --> 01:23:29,671
and a $40,000 gold fucking watch!

1854
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:35,009
Duke it out! Hit him!

1855
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:36,511
Get the fuck off me!

1856
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:42,141
And if anyone here thinks
I'm superficial or materialistic,

1857
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:44,519
go get a job at fucking McDonald's,

1858
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:46,604
'cause that's where you fucking belong!

1859
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:52,276
But before you depart
this room full of winners,

1860
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:56,155
I want you to take a good look
at the person next to you. Go on.

1861
01:23:57,157 --> 01:23:59,409
Because sometime in
the not-so-distant future,

1862
01:23:59,827 --> 01:24:03,287
you're gonna be pulling up to a red light
in your beat-up old fucking Pinto,

1863
01:24:03,622 --> 01:24:06,666
and that person's gonna be
pulling up right alongside you

1864
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,876
in their brand new Porsche

1865
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:11,713
with their beautiful wife by their side,

1866
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:13,798
who's got big voluptuous tits.

1867
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:17,719
And who're you gonna be sitting next to?

1868
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:21,097
Some disgusting wildebeest
with three days of razor-stubble,

1869
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:22,515
in a sleeveless muumuu,

1870
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:24,976
crammed in next to you
in a carload full of groceries

1871
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,811
from the fucking Price Club!

1872
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:29,188
That's who you're gonna
be sitting next to!

1873
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:31,524
So you listen to me and you listen well.

1874
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:33,860
Are you behind on your credit card bills?

1875
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:36,446
Good! Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

1876
01:24:36,864 --> 01:24:39,407
Is your landlord ready
to evict you? Good!

1877
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,868
Pick up the phone and start dialing!

1878
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:45,246
Does your girlfriend think
you're a fucking worthless loser?

1879
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:48,374
Good! Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

1880
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:52,003
I want you to deal with your problems
by becoming rich!

1881
01:24:54,173 --> 01:24:57,467
All you have to do today
is pick up that phone

1882
01:24:58,677 --> 01:25:01,512
and speak the words
that I have taught you.

1883
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:03,765
And I will make you richer

1884
01:25:03,891 --> 01:25:06,934
than the most powerful CEO
in the United States of fucking America!

1885
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:08,186
Yeah!

1886
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:10,605
Fuck, yeah!

1887
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:13,316
I want you to go out there

1888
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:15,860
and I want you to ram

1889
01:25:16,195 --> 01:25:19,447
Steve Madden stock
down your clients' throats

1890
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:21,824
until they fucking choke on it!

1891
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:26,496
Till they choke on it and they buy
100,000 shares! That's what I want.

1892
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,122
Yeah! Fuck, yeah.

1893
01:25:28,207 --> 01:25:29,832
You be ferocious!

1894
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,876
- You be relentless!
- Yeah!

1895
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:35,254
You be telephone fucking terrorists!

1896
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:40,301
Now let's knock this motherfucker
out of the park!

1897
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:15,336
At 1:00 p.m., we opened
the stock for sale at $4.50 a share.

1898
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:18,548
By 1:03, it was over $18.

1899
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:20,967
Even the big Wall Street
firms were buying.

1900
01:26:30,894 --> 01:26:32,812
Of the two million shares
offered for sale,

1901
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:35,857
a million belonged to me,
held in phony accounts by my ratholes.

1902
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:38,109
Now once the price hit the high teens...

1903
01:26:38,277 --> 01:26:40,403
You know what? Who gives a shit?

1904
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:42,446
As always, the point is this.

1905
01:26:42,573 --> 01:26:46,951
$22 million in three fucking hours!

1906
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,954
Can you believe this shit?

1907
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:52,456
- I fucking love this, baby!
- It's amazing!

1908
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:53,958
Jordan!

1909
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:55,376
Barry Kleinman's on the phone

1910
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,086
- from Future Video.
- Who?

1911
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,379
I don't know. He shot at your wedding.

1912
01:26:58,463 --> 01:26:59,505
He says it's urgent.

1913
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:01,716
Urgent? Who the fuck
is Barry Kleinman?

1914
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,384
Oh, my God, you wanna marry me?

1915
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:04,510
You're in love with me?

1916
01:27:04,595 --> 01:27:05,636
Yeah. Go fuck your cousin!

1917
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:06,762
Hey, Barry, what's up?

1918
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:08,973
Listen, I got this subpoena.

1919
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:10,516
Subpoena? What the fuck
are you talking about?

1920
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:13,227
Yeah, the FBI, they want
a copy of your wedding video.

1921
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:14,478
The fucking FBI?

1922
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,522
- You fucking kidding me?
- Listen to me.

1923
01:27:16,607 --> 01:27:17,899
His name is Denham.

1924
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:19,650
He's an agent with the New York office.

1925
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:20,776
What's his problem?

1926
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:23,487
He's a Boy Scout.
He thinks you're fucking Gordon Gekko.

1927
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:26,032
What does he want
with my wedding video?

1928
01:27:26,116 --> 01:27:27,742
It's like an invasion of my privacy.

1929
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:29,160
You know what I'm saying? It's like...

1930
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:30,578
It's intrusive, you know.

1931
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:33,331
He's got pictures of your
whole inner fucking circle.

1932
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:35,249
Pictures, names of the people.

1933
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:36,334
You know what he's trying to do?

1934
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:37,543
Exactly what he's doing.
Look at yourself.

1935
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:38,836
He's trying to rattle you,

1936
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:40,421
he's trying to rattle your old lady,

1937
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:43,215
so she nags you until
you become a fucking witness.

1938
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,759
He wants me to rat on myself?

1939
01:27:44,843 --> 01:27:46,636
He wants me to
give information about my...

1940
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:48,554
Listen. The good fucking news is,

1941
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:50,431
you know I know everybody downtown,

1942
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:52,725
I call up the Justice Department,
the DEA,

1943
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:55,895
nobody even knows you fucking exist,
so calm down!

1944
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:57,396
They don't know I exist?

1945
01:27:57,689 --> 01:27:59,315
- No.
- That's good.

1946
01:28:04,321 --> 01:28:05,363
But you...

1947
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:06,906
You know who he is, right?

1948
01:28:07,658 --> 01:28:09,617
- Yeah.
- So, if I just wanted to get

1949
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:11,661
some more information,
just find out what he knows,

1950
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:14,956
you could go to his house, right?

1951
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,916
Tap his phones a little bit, bug him.

1952
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,125
You could get some information...

1953
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:21,003
You don't fuck with these guys like that.

1954
01:28:21,088 --> 01:28:22,171
You don't fuck with them like that.

1955
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:23,422
What are you, nuts or something?

1956
01:28:23,507 --> 01:28:25,132
This is what you fucking do.
What do I pay you for?

1957
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:28,302
I have a fucking P.I. license, you know?
I make a living at this.

1958
01:28:28,387 --> 01:28:29,470
I'm not a cop anymore.

1959
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:31,555
They'll take my fucking license
away from me, all right?

1960
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:32,723
Okay.

1961
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:35,685
Okay, if I can't do that, can I just...

1962
01:28:35,978 --> 01:28:37,228
Can I give the guy a call?

1963
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:40,439
- Why? Is that...
- Jordan. Jordan.

1964
01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:41,524
Do me a favor?

1965
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:44,527
The only one who calls this guy
is your fucking lawyer.

1966
01:28:44,611 --> 01:28:45,611
I can't call him, right?

1967
01:28:45,696 --> 01:28:47,446
- It's against the rules?
- I told you,

1968
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:49,198
whatever the fuck you say to him,

1969
01:28:49,282 --> 01:28:51,909
he's gonna use against you.
Don't you understand?

1970
01:28:51,994 --> 01:28:53,744
He's smart, you're dumb.

1971
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:55,079
Fucking bullshit.

1972
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:58,165
Are we fucking talking tonight,
or are you gonna get schwacked?

1973
01:28:58,250 --> 01:28:59,792
The last time you
took these fucking pills,

1974
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:01,877
you put your head in the
fucking macaroni. I had to pick it up.

1975
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:04,422
All right.

1976
01:29:04,506 --> 01:29:06,048
Okay, I won't call him.

1977
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:12,888
Hey, fellas! Come on board.
The plank's right around there.

1978
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:15,141
Welcome!

1979
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:17,935
What a nice day.

1980
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:20,271
Hey.

1981
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:22,273
Welcome aboard.

1982
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:25,401
Jordan. Welcome aboard the Naomi.
Pleasure to meet you.

1983
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:27,069
Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes.

1984
01:29:27,154 --> 01:29:28,195
Hi, how are you?

1985
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:31,532
Let me introduce you. This is Nicole,
Heidi. Come on. Don't be shy.

1986
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:34,118
What are you guys all shy for?
Don't be scared.

1987
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:35,369
These are friends of Stratton.

1988
01:29:35,454 --> 01:29:36,954
- It's a pleasure.
- Hello.

1989
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:43,085
Your message said that
you wanted to speak privately.

1990
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:44,962
Right. I do want to speak privately.

1991
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,380
Give us a minute, huh, ladies?

1992
01:29:46,465 --> 01:29:48,049
Let me know if I can get you anything.

1993
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:49,967
We'd be happy to help.

1994
01:29:50,177 --> 01:29:51,218
You guys hungry?

1995
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:54,096
Want something to eat?
Got some pasta, shrimp, lobster.

1996
01:29:54,181 --> 01:29:56,557
I got whiskey.
Any kind of booze you want.

1997
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:58,100
You know what?
The Bureau doesn't allow us

1998
01:29:58,185 --> 01:29:59,602
to drink while we're at sea.

1999
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:02,229
Duh! Of course.

2000
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:04,148
Ever been on one of these before?

2001
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:05,566
A boat?

2002
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:07,610
I learned how to sail when I was six.

2003
01:30:07,694 --> 01:30:09,779
No shit. Is that right? Really?

2004
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:11,572
On one like this, though?

2005
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:14,450
I had the whole front extended in order
to fit the chopper up there.

2006
01:30:14,576 --> 01:30:15,868
See that?

2007
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:18,621
Anyway, this is for you.

2008
01:30:18,705 --> 01:30:21,540
It's a complete list of every person
that was at my wedding.

2009
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:24,376
I understand you wanted
the whole wedding video.

2010
01:30:24,461 --> 01:30:27,213
Figured this would help expedite
the whole process, right?

2011
01:30:27,297 --> 01:30:29,048
- There you go.
- Look,

2012
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:32,051
my point is that
I know you're investigating Stratton.

2013
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:35,638
But for the life of me,
I can't figure out why.

2014
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:37,389
I know we're a little unorthodox,

2015
01:30:37,474 --> 01:30:39,183
we're a little loud in
the way we do things.

2016
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:40,392
But you gotta understand,

2017
01:30:40,477 --> 01:30:41,936
we're the new guys
on the block, you know,

2018
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,146
we're trying to make
a name for ourselves.

2019
01:30:44,231 --> 01:30:48,859
But I want you to understand,
we don't do anything illegal.

2020
01:30:49,653 --> 01:30:50,736
Whatsoever.

2021
01:30:50,821 --> 01:30:52,363
I mean, you could talk to the SEC.

2022
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:55,491
They were at my office 15 times
over the last six months.

2023
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:58,202
I mean, I got... I got nothing to hide.

2024
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:01,038
Well, you know the SEC
is a civil regulatory agency.

2025
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:02,665
We pursue criminal activities.

2026
01:31:02,749 --> 01:31:05,584
Exactly! You go after real criminals,

2027
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:09,213
which makes me wonder what
the hell you're investigating me for?

2028
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:10,673
I mean, honestly...

2029
01:31:10,757 --> 01:31:14,593
What is it that you think
that we did or do? I don't get it.

2030
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:15,970
Well, I...

2031
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:18,472
Look, Jordan, I can't discuss
an ongoing investigation.

2032
01:31:18,557 --> 01:31:20,224
No, I get that. No, I understand.

2033
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:21,725
With that said...

2034
01:31:22,602 --> 01:31:24,436
This case got dumped on my desk...

2035
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:26,355
- Did it?
- You know, by a higher-up

2036
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:29,650
who needs to make a show of looking
into the new company on the block,

2037
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:31,193
- with all the press and everything.
- New loud guys.

2038
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:34,864
And then I end up being the schmuck
who does the looking. Exactly.

2039
01:31:34,948 --> 01:31:36,866
It's just, you know... It bothers me.

2040
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:39,493
We're the new guy. We're the one
that's banging on Wall Street's door.

2041
01:31:39,578 --> 01:31:40,661
I mean, you should...

2042
01:31:40,745 --> 01:31:42,663
You should see what's going on
at the bigger firms.

2043
01:31:42,747 --> 01:31:44,206
I mean, I know all the information.

2044
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:47,168
It's true! Goldman,
Lehman Brothers, Merrill...

2045
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:49,253
Collateralized debt obligations?

2046
01:31:49,379 --> 01:31:50,629
This Internet stock bullshit?

2047
01:31:50,714 --> 01:31:52,506
I mean, it's a fucking travesty.

2048
01:31:52,591 --> 01:31:57,595
I could take you step-by-step
through what exactly is occurring.

2049
01:31:57,846 --> 01:31:59,430
All you have to do is ask.

2050
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:00,890
I'm available.

2051
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:02,433
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

2052
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:05,394
I don't see why a little sitdown like this

2053
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:07,813
can't be profitable for the both of us.

2054
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:10,191
It should. Right?
It should profit the both of us.

2055
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:11,775
- It should.
- Look.

2056
01:32:12,319 --> 01:32:14,528
I'm gonna give you my personal line.

2057
01:32:14,613 --> 01:32:17,531
Five days a week,
you just call me, feel free.

2058
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:19,450
- I'll do that.
- Great.

2059
01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:23,704
Are you sure you guys
don't want something to drink?

2060
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,456
You're not hungry? Nothing?

2061
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,166
- Nothing? No?
- Oh, no.

2062
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:32,880
Let me ask you,
and if you don't wanna get too personal,

2063
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:35,257
just tell me to shut up at any time.

2064
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:38,761
Did you try to get your
broker's license at one time?

2065
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:41,680
Did I hear that right? Were you trying
to take a stab at Wall Street?

2066
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:44,516
- No?
- Who you been talking to?

2067
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:45,601
Who the fuck you been talking to?

2068
01:32:45,685 --> 01:32:48,437
Well, you're investigating me.
I hear things.

2069
01:32:48,521 --> 01:32:50,606
You know what I mean?

2070
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:52,274
You ever think about
what would've happened

2071
01:32:52,359 --> 01:32:54,818
if you would have stayed the course?

2072
01:32:56,238 --> 01:32:58,072
You know what?
When I'm riding home on the subway

2073
01:32:58,156 --> 01:32:59,406
and my balls are fucking sweating,

2074
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:01,283
I'm wearing the same suit
three days in a row...

2075
01:33:01,368 --> 01:33:02,868
Yeah, you bet I do.

2076
01:33:02,953 --> 01:33:04,620
I've thought about it before.
Who wouldn't, right?

2077
01:33:04,704 --> 01:33:05,746
Right, who fucking wouldn't?

2078
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:06,997
What do you get...

2079
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:08,332
Another personal question,
no need to answer...

2080
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:09,792
No, that's all right, Jordan.

2081
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:12,920
What do you pull in? 50, 60K?
Something like that?

2082
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:15,047
A year? In the ballpark?

2083
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:16,590
Well, I...

2084
01:33:16,675 --> 01:33:18,467
Let's put it this way.

2085
01:33:18,551 --> 01:33:21,345
You get a free handgun
when you sign up for the Bureau.

2086
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:24,223
No, but it fucking pisses me off.
You know what I mean?

2087
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:26,475
You think about the people
that built this country,

2088
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:27,977
hardworking people like you.

2089
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:30,604
Firefighters, teachers, FBI agents.

2090
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:34,400
End of the day, you guys get
fucking skinned alive financially.

2091
01:33:34,484 --> 01:33:36,360
It fucking makes me angry.

2092
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:39,530
Now the one thing about
Wall Street and this market is,

2093
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:41,282
for me, I feel

2094
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:44,702
it's good to give back.
You know, there's...

2095
01:33:44,786 --> 01:33:46,954
There are situations where I can

2096
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:50,582
make those situations better for people.
You know?

2097
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:51,959
You know what I mean.

2098
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:53,460
Opportunity

2099
01:33:53,753 --> 01:33:55,004
is everything.

2100
01:33:55,088 --> 01:33:56,338
Exactly.

2101
01:33:56,464 --> 01:33:58,924
Take for example,
I got this one kid, right?

2102
01:33:59,009 --> 01:34:02,803
Went to school for environmental
science, something like that.

2103
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:04,680
He was bogged down by student loans.

2104
01:34:04,764 --> 01:34:07,474
Turns out, his mother
needed triple bypass surgery.

2105
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:08,976
- Jesus.
- Right. Horrible situation.

2106
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:10,019
Sure.

2107
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:11,186
But we got him into the market

2108
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:12,980
at the right time
and chose the right stock.

2109
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:14,815
We gave him the right guidance.

2110
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:18,068
Boom! Overnight,
changed his entire life.

2111
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:21,530
Got to put his mother into
the best hospital in New York City.

2112
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:24,491
It didn't work out for her, granted,
she passed away, unfortunately.

2113
01:34:24,576 --> 01:34:26,493
But we gave him that opportunity.

2114
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:27,745
You know what I'm saying?

2115
01:34:28,455 --> 01:34:32,958
It's just about setting up the right team,
and then overnight your life can change.

2116
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:40,758
What does... What does an intern...

2117
01:34:42,302 --> 01:34:44,178
What does an intern
make in a deal like that?

2118
01:34:44,262 --> 01:34:46,305
Well, in that situation,

2119
01:34:47,223 --> 01:34:50,267
in that particular trade,
and it was one trade,

2120
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:53,103
north of half a million dollars.

2121
01:34:56,733 --> 01:34:58,984
And I'd do that for anybody, you know,

2122
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:01,737
anybody that needs
the proper guidance.

2123
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:25,636
Can you say that again,
just the way you said it?

2124
01:35:26,054 --> 01:35:27,763
Just the same way.

2125
01:35:31,976 --> 01:35:33,060
I don't know what you're talking about.

2126
01:35:33,144 --> 01:35:35,396
Oh, come on! You know
what I'm talking about.

2127
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,481
I think what Jordan just did is he...

2128
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:38,690
- If I'm not mistaken...
- No.

2129
01:35:38,775 --> 01:35:40,901
...you just tried to bribe a federal officer.

2130
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:43,070
No, technically I didn't bribe anybody.

2131
01:35:43,154 --> 01:35:45,572
No, no, that's not
the conversation I heard, Jordan.

2132
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:47,157
No, no, according
to the U.S. criminal code,

2133
01:35:47,242 --> 01:35:50,661
there needs to be an exact dollar figure
for the exchange of services.

2134
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:52,371
That would not hold up in a court of law.

2135
01:35:52,455 --> 01:35:54,123
Nah, it's not how I heard it.

2136
01:35:54,207 --> 01:35:56,917
No, no, no, that's the truth.
But I want to tell you this.

2137
01:35:57,001 --> 01:35:58,001
Yeah.

2138
01:35:58,086 --> 01:35:59,586
The same gentleman that told me

2139
01:35:59,671 --> 01:36:01,422
that you tried to get
your broker's license

2140
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:03,632
also told me that
you are a straight arrow.

2141
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:05,217
He ran a security check on me.

2142
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:06,510
Well...

2143
01:36:06,636 --> 01:36:09,596
Yeah, when you sail
on a boat fit for a Bond villain,

2144
01:36:09,681 --> 01:36:12,349
sometimes you need to
play the part. Right?

2145
01:36:13,143 --> 01:36:15,060
I think it's time you both
get the fuck off my boat.

2146
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:16,437
What do you say?

2147
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:18,772
You know, Jordan,
I'll tell you something.

2148
01:36:18,857 --> 01:36:21,859
Most of the Wall Street
jackasses that I bust,

2149
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:24,611
they're to the manor born.

2150
01:36:24,696 --> 01:36:25,779
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

2151
01:36:25,864 --> 01:36:29,491
Their fathers are douchebags,
just like their fathers before them.

2152
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:32,035
But you...

2153
01:36:33,746 --> 01:36:36,039
You, Jordan,
you got this way all on your own.

2154
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:37,374
Did I?

2155
01:36:37,459 --> 01:36:39,543
- Good for you, little man.
- Little man?

2156
01:36:39,669 --> 01:36:40,919
Good for you.

2157
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:42,171
Me, the little man?

2158
01:36:42,255 --> 01:36:43,297
And let me tell you something.

2159
01:36:43,381 --> 01:36:45,215
Let me tell you something else.

2160
01:36:45,341 --> 01:36:47,509
Honestly, I'm not bullshitting here,

2161
01:36:47,677 --> 01:36:48,802
this is one of the nicest boats

2162
01:36:48,887 --> 01:36:50,888
- that I've ever been on, I gotta tell you.
- I bet it is.

2163
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:52,389
And you know
what I was just thinking, too?

2164
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:55,767
The fucking hero that I'm gonna be
back at the office

2165
01:36:55,894 --> 01:36:58,061
when the Bureau seizes
this fucking boat.

2166
01:36:58,188 --> 01:37:00,355
Because, I mean,
fuckety-fuck-fuck, Jordan,

2167
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,732
look at this thing!

2168
01:37:02,108 --> 01:37:03,150
It's beautiful!

2169
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:06,195
And you got the beautiful girls there.
It's wonderful.

2170
01:37:06,279 --> 01:37:08,739
All right, get the fuck off my boat.

2171
01:37:08,907 --> 01:37:10,449
I'm sure we'll be seeing each other

2172
01:37:10,533 --> 01:37:11,575
- real soon.
- I'm sure.

2173
01:37:11,659 --> 01:37:15,120
Good luck on that subway ride home
to your miserable, ugly fucking wives.

2174
01:37:15,205 --> 01:37:18,290
I'm gonna have Heidi lick some caviar
off my balls in the meantime.

2175
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:21,043
Hey, you guys want to take
some lobsters for your ride home?

2176
01:37:21,127 --> 01:37:23,754
Fucking miserable pricks,
I know you can't afford them!

2177
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:25,923
Fucking cheap fucks.

2178
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:28,050
Fucking miserable pricks.

2179
01:37:28,134 --> 01:37:31,345
Hey, fellas! Look what
I found in my pocket! Look!

2180
01:37:31,638 --> 01:37:33,388
A year's salary right here.

2181
01:37:33,473 --> 01:37:36,141
You know what I call them?
Fun coupons!

2182
01:37:36,226 --> 01:37:37,476
See that!

2183
01:37:38,019 --> 01:37:40,020
They're fun coupons!

2184
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:50,572
Switzerland?
What the fuck is in Switzerland?

2185
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:52,699
Swiss fucking banks, that's what.

2186
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:55,452
It was ass-covering time.
I had to hide my money.

2187
01:37:56,746 --> 01:37:58,288
Enter Rugrat.

2188
01:37:58,414 --> 01:38:00,040
He knew this Swiss banker
from law school.

2189
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:01,166
That's for European pussy!

2190
01:38:01,251 --> 01:38:02,501
But he was in Geneva.

2191
01:38:02,585 --> 01:38:04,962
And there was no way
I was gonna make that flight sober.

2192
01:38:06,798 --> 01:38:08,423
So I knew if I took my drugs right,

2193
01:38:08,508 --> 01:38:10,551
I could sleep through the entire flight.

2194
01:38:10,969 --> 01:38:13,303
But I had to take them just right.

2195
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:15,973
At 4:00 p.m., I popped a few more ludes,

2196
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:17,516
which started kicking in by the time

2197
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,351
I finished my sales meeting.

2198
01:38:19,602 --> 01:38:20,811
My tingle phase.

2199
01:38:21,145 --> 01:38:22,813
By dinner, I popped a few more

2200
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:25,816
on top of some cocktails
and a Valium or two.

2201
01:38:25,984 --> 01:38:27,484
My slur phase.

2202
01:38:29,654 --> 01:38:31,989
By 8:30, I took a few more ludes

2203
01:38:32,198 --> 01:38:34,783
and pretty much lost all my motor skills.

2204
01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:36,535
This was the drool phase.

2205
01:38:39,581 --> 01:38:42,958
And by 10:00, I didn't know
who or what the fuck I was.

2206
01:38:43,042 --> 01:38:44,626
The amnesia phase.

2207
01:38:45,545 --> 01:38:47,504
We boarded the plane
just before midnight.

2208
01:38:47,589 --> 01:38:49,298
Wow! Look at you!

2209
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:51,341
- You're beautiful.
- Excuse me, sir.

2210
01:38:51,551 --> 01:38:53,719
His sleeping pills just kicked in.
He's all right.

2211
01:38:53,803 --> 01:38:55,345
May I see your boarding passes, sir?

2212
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:57,180
We have the boarding passes.

2213
01:38:57,307 --> 01:38:59,308
Jesus Christ, I wanna fuck her.

2214
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:01,643
Hey! Fucking relax.

2215
01:39:01,853 --> 01:39:03,895
Oh, my God!
You got your hand on my fucking cock!

2216
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:05,355
I don't. Cut it out.

2217
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,440
He's got his hand on my dick again.

2218
01:39:06,524 --> 01:39:07,524
I'm just trying to buckle you up.

2219
01:39:07,609 --> 01:39:08,817
You got your hand on his dick?

2220
01:39:08,901 --> 01:39:10,861
You gotta stop doing that
in public places.

2221
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:12,904
Oh, my God. Take it off!

2222
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:14,197
Take it off!

2223
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:16,992
I heard there's
a treasure map under here.

2224
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:19,661
- Stop! I know, miss.
- Excuse me, sir.

2225
01:39:19,746 --> 01:39:21,246
Please sit down.

2226
01:39:21,331 --> 01:39:22,789
- Watch it.
- Go back to your seat, please.

2227
01:39:22,874 --> 01:39:25,167
- What are you upset about?
- Please go back to your seat.

2228
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:27,127
I will have to call the captain.

2229
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:29,713
Please, sir, please, sir. Sit down.

2230
01:39:29,797 --> 01:39:31,465
Please sit down!

2231
01:39:31,549 --> 01:39:33,133
- I'm going! Stop.
- Okay, sorry.

2232
01:39:33,217 --> 01:39:34,843
We apologize. We're gonna go to sleep.

2233
01:39:34,927 --> 01:39:36,136
Question. I wanna ask you a question.

2234
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:37,763
Fasten your seat belt, sir.

2235
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:39,931
We cannot take off
if you haven't fastened

2236
01:39:40,016 --> 01:39:41,058
- your seat belt.
- I'm really horny, too.

2237
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:42,267
Sit down. Fasten it.

2238
01:39:42,352 --> 01:39:43,852
- Right. Okay, I'll sit down...
- I will do it for you.

2239
01:39:43,936 --> 01:39:44,936
- What?
- I'll do it for you.

2240
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:46,188
You gotta speak English.

2241
01:39:46,272 --> 01:39:48,231
We don't understand
this language you're speaking.

2242
01:39:48,316 --> 01:39:49,816
I will help him with his seat belt.

2243
01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:53,028
- You gotta put it on right.
- Sit back. Sit back, sir.

2244
01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:55,238
- There you go.
- All right. I'll just lean back...

2245
01:39:57,575 --> 01:39:59,242
Bitte, Hilfe!

2246
01:40:14,509 --> 01:40:15,801
Jesus Christ!

2247
01:40:15,885 --> 01:40:17,260
Fuck!

2248
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:20,305
Donnie...

2249
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:23,517
Donnie, this isn't funny.
You gotta untie me, buddy.

2250
01:40:24,143 --> 01:40:25,852
I can't untie you.

2251
01:40:25,937 --> 01:40:28,772
The captain tied you up.
He almost fucking tasered you.

2252
01:40:29,732 --> 01:40:32,150
Why?

2253
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:35,112
He's got a fear of flying.

2254
01:40:39,492 --> 01:40:41,034
He's very nervous on planes, I'm sorry,

2255
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:42,911
it's not you, sweetheart,
don't beat yourself up.

2256
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:45,956
Easy, easy. He's fine.
He's just a nervous flyer.

2257
01:40:46,124 --> 01:40:48,291
You were screaming at people.

2258
01:40:48,376 --> 01:40:49,751
Oh, fuck off.

2259
01:40:49,836 --> 01:40:51,962
You were on the floor
rolling around and shit.

2260
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:53,088
Oh, Jesus.

2261
01:40:53,172 --> 01:40:55,257
You called the captain the N-word.

2262
01:40:55,341 --> 01:40:56,842
I called the captain the N-word?

2263
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:59,177
- Yeah, he was very upset.
- Really?

2264
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:01,638
- Luckily we're in first class.
- Jesus.

2265
01:41:02,473 --> 01:41:05,308
Jesus Christ, I think
you have a fucking drug problem.

2266
01:41:06,602 --> 01:41:09,020
Where are the ludes?

2267
01:41:10,064 --> 01:41:11,565
They're up my ass. Don't worry about it.

2268
01:41:11,649 --> 01:41:13,233
- I got it.
- Okay.

2269
01:41:13,317 --> 01:41:14,901
Thank God.

2270
01:41:15,361 --> 01:41:17,821
Jesus Christ, what are we gonna do
when we get to Switzerland, buddy?

2271
01:41:17,947 --> 01:41:18,947
This is bad.

2272
01:41:19,031 --> 01:41:21,366
Fucking things are against
my chest. I can't breathe.

2273
01:41:21,492 --> 01:41:23,243
Come on, do something
to calm me down. Please.

2274
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:25,036
Okay, shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.

2275
01:41:25,621 --> 01:41:26,705
Okay.

2276
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:29,583
- That's good.
- Go to sleep.

2277
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:30,792
Rub it harder, buddy.

2278
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:32,502
You're all right.

2279
01:41:32,879 --> 01:41:35,172
We all love you. Shut the fuck up!

2280
01:41:41,012 --> 01:41:43,889
Mr. Belfort, you're free to go.

2281
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:47,184
Really?

2282
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:52,355
- Hey, Donnie.
- Yeah?

2283
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:53,940
When we get out there,
try not to act like yourself.

2284
01:41:54,025 --> 01:41:56,318
Okay? Let's make Geneva
an asshole-free Donnie zone, all right?

2285
01:41:56,402 --> 01:41:57,819
What are you fucking coming at me for?

2286
01:41:57,904 --> 01:41:59,446
Hey, listen. The only reason
you're sitting in this limo

2287
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:01,114
and not in a Swiss jail
is because of my friend. Okay?

2288
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:02,365
Hilfe!

2289
01:42:03,326 --> 01:42:05,744
We're here. We're here.
Everyone calm down.

2290
01:42:06,245 --> 01:42:07,662
Jordan Belfort!

2291
01:42:07,747 --> 01:42:08,997
At last.

2292
01:42:09,081 --> 01:42:11,666
Nicholas has told me
so much about you.

2293
01:42:11,751 --> 01:42:13,627
Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.

2294
01:42:13,878 --> 01:42:16,254
- Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- Nice to meet you.

2295
01:42:16,839 --> 01:42:18,048
It's a joke.

2296
01:42:18,174 --> 01:42:20,425
You'll understand
when you're in the fucking seat.

2297
01:42:20,802 --> 01:42:22,385
You need a bigger couch. For guests.

2298
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:24,179
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I don't understand. I'm sorry.

2299
01:42:24,263 --> 01:42:27,098
I'm curious about
your bank secrecy laws here.

2300
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:31,895
Wait. Yes. Excusez-moi, Jordan.

2301
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,524
Swiss custom requires 10 minutes of...

2302
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:36,650
Blah, blah, blah.

2303
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:38,360
- Chit chat.
- Yeah, chit chat, thank you.

2304
01:42:38,444 --> 01:42:40,070
...before business can be discussed.

2305
01:42:41,614 --> 01:42:42,739
Yeah.

2306
01:42:45,535 --> 01:42:46,576
Of course.

2307
01:42:47,245 --> 01:42:50,038
Let's get down to it.
What would you like to know?

2308
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:53,458
Under what circumstances
would you be obligated

2309
01:42:53,543 --> 01:42:55,710
to cooperate with an FBI

2310
01:42:56,087 --> 01:42:59,172
or a U.S. Justice Department
investigation, for example?

2311
01:42:59,799 --> 01:43:00,966
ça depend.

2312
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:02,717
ça depend?

2313
01:43:02,802 --> 01:43:03,802
Oui.

2314
01:43:04,887 --> 01:43:07,556
Ça depend on what, exactly?

2315
01:43:08,349 --> 01:43:10,600
Whether America plans
to invade Switzerland

2316
01:43:10,685 --> 01:43:12,269
in the coming months.

2317
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:14,938
Shall I check if tanks
are rolling down the Rue de la Croy?

2318
01:43:15,022 --> 01:43:17,107
- Yes. Rue de la Croix.
- Croix. Croix.

2319
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:20,026
Not Croy. Not Rue de la Croy. It's Croix.

2320
01:43:20,236 --> 01:43:22,445
See, this is what he used to do
back in law school. Check me.

2321
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:24,281
- Champagne. Champagne.
- Yeah.

2322
01:43:24,365 --> 01:43:26,741
Yeah, yeah.
French fries, pommes frites.

2323
01:43:27,493 --> 01:43:30,036
- And that kind of stuff.
- That's funny.

2324
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:36,501
What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,
is are you going to fuck me over?

2325
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:42,799
I understand perfectly,
you American shit.

2326
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:47,345
The only way
the Banque Réal de Genève

2327
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:49,514
would cooperate
with a foreign legal body

2328
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:53,768
is if the crime being pursued
is also a crime in Switzerland.

2329
01:43:53,895 --> 01:43:58,440
But there are very few Swiss laws
which apply to your practices.

2330
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:01,276
From a financial standpoint,

2331
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:04,446
you are now in heaven.

2332
01:44:04,614 --> 01:44:06,489
See, I told you he was fantastic, right?

2333
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:11,786
If the U.S. Justice Department
sent us a subpoena, it would become

2334
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:13,872
papier toilette.

2335
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:17,000
We would wipe our ass with it.

2336
01:44:17,668 --> 01:44:20,253
Unless, of course,
it was an investigation

2337
01:44:20,338 --> 01:44:22,172
into stock fraud,

2338
01:44:22,256 --> 01:44:24,424
which is a crime here in Switzerland,
if I'm correct.

2339
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:28,511
Then there would
have to be coopération on your part,

2340
01:44:28,638 --> 01:44:30,597
- if I'm not mistaken.
- Yes.

2341
01:44:30,765 --> 01:44:33,183
Yes, we would.

2342
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:35,894
Assuming the account
is under your name.

2343
01:44:37,104 --> 01:44:40,148
If it were another name,

2344
01:44:41,359 --> 01:44:42,984
a friend's, camarade...

2345
01:44:43,069 --> 01:44:44,152
Cousin?

2346
01:44:48,908 --> 01:44:50,617
- Relative?
- Yeah.

2347
01:44:52,828 --> 01:44:55,455
Was that yodeling I just heard

2348
01:44:55,581 --> 01:44:58,041
or did you just say
what I thought you said?

2349
01:44:58,125 --> 01:44:59,876
Yes. Yes.

2350
01:45:00,628 --> 01:45:03,171
He's telling me to use a fucking rathole.

2351
01:45:03,381 --> 01:45:05,048
But a U.S. rathole would never get

2352
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:07,342
into Switzerland with all that money.

2353
01:45:07,426 --> 01:45:11,262
What I needed was a rathole
with a European passport.

2354
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:19,980
Jordan.

2355
01:45:20,064 --> 01:45:22,941
Hey. How's my favorite aunt, huh?

2356
01:45:23,025 --> 01:45:24,442
Welcome. Was the traffic terrible?

2357
01:45:24,527 --> 01:45:26,069
Oh, no, not at all.

2358
01:45:28,614 --> 01:45:30,240
Jordan, come in.

2359
01:45:30,408 --> 01:45:32,909
Thank God Aunt Emma
didn't need too much convincing.

2360
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:36,079
Turned out the British
weren't too different from the Swiss.

2361
01:45:36,247 --> 01:45:38,748
Money talks and bullshit takes the bus.

2362
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:41,126
How do you say "rathole" in British?

2363
01:45:41,544 --> 01:45:44,004
If you get into any trouble whatsoever,

2364
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:46,840
I'll come forth immediately.
I'll say that I duped you.

2365
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:48,216
That I promise.

2366
01:45:48,926 --> 01:45:51,594
Risk is what keeps us young,
isn't it, darling?

2367
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:57,726
Sometimes I wonder

2368
01:45:58,019 --> 01:46:01,021
if you let money get
the best of you, my love.

2369
01:46:01,147 --> 01:46:04,274
Among other substances.

2370
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:10,071
It's that obvious, huh?

2371
01:46:10,156 --> 01:46:13,408
It's chilly, darling,
and you're sweating bullets.

2372
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:17,954
What can I say? I'm...

2373
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:20,498
I'm a drug addict.

2374
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:21,958
I really am.

2375
01:46:23,002 --> 01:46:24,753
Cocaine, pills,

2376
01:46:25,254 --> 01:46:27,672
whatever it is, I'll fucking do it.

2377
01:46:28,215 --> 01:46:29,924
Now that's the truth.

2378
01:46:30,009 --> 01:46:31,259
I mean...

2379
01:46:31,343 --> 01:46:32,719
I'm a sex addict, too.

2380
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:36,056
Well, there are worse things
to be addicted to than sex.

2381
01:46:37,349 --> 01:46:39,726
Jesus, why am I telling you all this?
Why am I...

2382
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:41,436
I'm sorry.

2383
01:46:42,188 --> 01:46:44,397
Because I'm very easy to talk to.

2384
01:46:44,774 --> 01:46:47,484
You are. You are easy to talk to.

2385
01:46:48,652 --> 01:46:50,070
I suppose it's...

2386
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:51,571
Just my job, you know.

2387
01:46:52,823 --> 01:46:54,783
All these people dependent on me.

2388
01:46:54,867 --> 01:46:57,577
Tens of millions of dollars
at stake, you know.

2389
01:46:57,661 --> 01:46:59,370
Sometimes I feel like I...

2390
01:46:59,455 --> 01:47:02,624
I've bitten off more than
I can chew, you know.

2391
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:05,126
You're a man with large appetites.

2392
01:47:05,294 --> 01:47:06,377
Yeah.

2393
01:47:08,089 --> 01:47:10,006
Is she fucking hitting on me?

2394
01:47:10,341 --> 01:47:11,382
Yeah.

2395
01:47:11,509 --> 01:47:12,801
Yeah, I am.

2396
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:18,515
I suppose I put that
on myself though, right?

2397
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:20,391
My decision.

2398
01:47:20,893 --> 01:47:22,352
It's just hard to...

2399
01:47:22,436 --> 01:47:26,356
Hard to learn to control
the anxiety sometimes, you know?

2400
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:28,483
You know, to...

2401
01:47:28,692 --> 01:47:31,361
Learn to relax and let go and...

2402
01:47:32,363 --> 01:47:34,364
To release the tension.

2403
01:47:35,407 --> 01:47:36,866
She is hitting on me.

2404
01:47:37,827 --> 01:47:39,244
Holy shit!

2405
01:47:39,537 --> 01:47:41,788
Yeah, to release the tension.

2406
01:47:45,626 --> 01:47:47,377
I suppose we...

2407
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,255
We all just need to learn...

2408
01:47:50,881 --> 01:47:54,175
Learn to do what
comes naturally in life, you know?

2409
01:47:56,095 --> 01:47:58,555
Is he fucking hitting on me?

2410
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:06,437
Stability, dear.

2411
01:48:06,522 --> 01:48:07,939
Family.

2412
01:48:14,572 --> 01:48:16,739
You take care of my niece, my love.

2413
01:48:16,824 --> 01:48:19,367
I'll take care of everything over here.

2414
01:48:20,327 --> 01:48:21,411
Deal.

2415
01:48:23,956 --> 01:48:26,124
Come on! There you go.

2416
01:48:28,169 --> 01:48:31,421
We had, literally, a fuckload of money.

2417
01:48:31,922 --> 01:48:33,923
Aunt Emma could never
carry all this by herself.

2418
01:48:34,758 --> 01:48:38,428
So I thought to myself,
who else has a European passport?

2419
01:48:38,596 --> 01:48:40,513
Brad, you're making this
too fucking tight!

2420
01:48:40,598 --> 01:48:43,391
Now Brad, as a successful drug dealer,

2421
01:48:43,475 --> 01:48:45,685
spent his winters in the south of France,

2422
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:47,812
which is where
he met his wife, Chantalle,

2423
01:48:47,897 --> 01:48:50,773
a stripper of Slovenian origin

2424
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:52,358
born, in of all places,

2425
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:54,444
Switzerland.

2426
01:48:58,616 --> 01:49:00,283
Well, this is fucked.

2427
01:49:01,327 --> 01:49:02,785
No shit.

2428
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:08,750
Like, this will take her like 50 trips.

2429
01:49:08,834 --> 01:49:10,043
I know.

2430
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:14,964
Let me ask you something?

2431
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:17,675
What about her family? Right?

2432
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,428
I mean, they all got
Swiss passports, right.

2433
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:22,388
She's got parents,
she's got a brother, right?

2434
01:49:22,473 --> 01:49:24,390
The brother's got a wife.
That's five fucking people.

2435
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:26,392
Six, seven trips, boom, right?

2436
01:49:26,477 --> 01:49:28,061
They're all fucking
Swiss nitwits like her.

2437
01:49:28,145 --> 01:49:29,395
- They'll do it.
- We could do that.

2438
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:31,940
At least I have a family,
you crooked-nose fuck!

2439
01:49:32,024 --> 01:49:34,859
Hey, don't forget about my money.

2440
01:49:36,654 --> 01:49:37,737
I'm sorry, what's that?

2441
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:39,280
Yeah, I forgot to tell you.
He's got some...

2442
01:49:39,365 --> 01:49:41,407
- He's got some money.
- My money.

2443
01:49:41,784 --> 01:49:43,993
I got a couple of mil
coming in like a week.

2444
01:49:44,078 --> 01:49:46,663
When it gets in, I'll give you a call,
you come pick it up.

2445
01:49:49,291 --> 01:49:50,708
You give me a call?

2446
01:49:52,336 --> 01:49:55,588
When it gets here, I'll give you a call
and you'll come pick it up.

2447
01:49:55,673 --> 01:49:57,465
Well, we don't fucking
work for you, man!

2448
01:49:58,008 --> 01:50:00,969
Sweetheart,
you have my money taped to your tits.

2449
01:50:01,053 --> 01:50:03,054
Okay? Technically, you do work for me.

2450
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,684
Hey, Jordan, we're gonna need to talk.

2451
01:50:07,935 --> 01:50:09,435
If I fucking do this,
I'm telling you right now,

2452
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,478
I ain't going to him, okay.

2453
01:50:10,562 --> 01:50:11,604
- I'm not a fucking shvartze.
- I got it.

2454
01:50:11,689 --> 01:50:12,981
I don't do fucking pickups, all right?

2455
01:50:13,065 --> 01:50:14,107
- I got it.
- Well, listen to me.

2456
01:50:14,191 --> 01:50:15,775
We meet someplace that I fucking say.

2457
01:50:15,859 --> 01:50:17,235
And you tell that fucking piece of shit,

2458
01:50:17,319 --> 01:50:18,486
- he comes correct.
- I will.

2459
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:20,863
He comes in all fucking loopy
and fucked up, I swear to God

2460
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:22,782
I'll mash that douchebag's teeth in.

2461
01:50:22,866 --> 01:50:24,617
You're gonna mash
whose fucking teeth in?

2462
01:50:24,702 --> 01:50:26,411
Whose fucking teeth
are you gonna mash in?

2463
01:50:26,495 --> 01:50:28,788
I put the money on that
fucking table! Not you!

2464
01:50:28,872 --> 01:50:30,707
I'm the reason
we have this whole fucking deal!

2465
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:32,792
- He's got a gun, you fucking idiot!
- Fuck his gun!

2466
01:50:32,876 --> 01:50:34,252
I put that money in there!

2467
01:50:34,336 --> 01:50:35,712
You know what?
You're a fucking pill dealer.

2468
01:50:35,796 --> 01:50:38,089
I got five more just like you, bro.

2469
01:50:38,173 --> 01:50:39,882
Keep talking, you fucking piece of shit!

2470
01:50:39,967 --> 01:50:41,718
You know what else?
You dress like shit!

2471
01:50:41,802 --> 01:50:42,802
So fuck you!

2472
01:50:42,886 --> 01:50:44,637
- Fucking motherfucker!
- Oh! Jesus!

2473
01:50:44,722 --> 01:50:46,556
How about that, faggot?
Who's a faggot?

2474
01:50:46,682 --> 01:50:48,474
You okay? Hey, pal.

2475
01:50:51,186 --> 01:50:53,980
The next day,
Aunt Emma flew to Geneva.

2476
01:50:54,064 --> 01:50:56,399
Two million in cash in her carry-on,

2477
01:50:56,483 --> 01:50:59,444
which in the big picture
was a drop in the Swiss bucket.

2478
01:51:00,696 --> 01:51:01,988
'Cause the following month,

2479
01:51:02,072 --> 01:51:03,948
over the course of six round trips,

2480
01:51:04,033 --> 01:51:08,077
Chantalle's family and friends
smuggled in over 20 million in cash

2481
01:51:08,162 --> 01:51:09,912
without even a hiccup.

2482
01:51:14,918 --> 01:51:16,836
- And I have some more.
- Really?

2483
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,129
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

2484
01:51:18,213 --> 01:51:19,339
And here.

2485
01:51:19,423 --> 01:51:21,424
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

2486
01:51:21,508 --> 01:51:23,760
Yeah, like four bags of it.

2487
01:51:25,387 --> 01:51:27,722
Are you Swiss-Slovakian
or Swiss-Slovenian?

2488
01:51:27,806 --> 01:51:29,349
- Slovenian.
- Slovenian?

2489
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:30,641
Who cares. You're blonde.

2490
01:51:30,726 --> 01:51:31,726
Oh, stop.

2491
01:51:52,581 --> 01:51:53,706
Shit.

2492
01:51:53,791 --> 01:51:55,041
Just put the fucking car in park,

2493
01:51:55,125 --> 01:51:56,918
you dumb fucking idiot!

2494
01:51:58,462 --> 01:52:00,088
I can't close this briefcase.

2495
01:52:00,172 --> 01:52:01,547
One fucking day.

2496
01:52:01,632 --> 01:52:03,591
One fucking day,
you couldn't keep it together?

2497
01:52:03,675 --> 01:52:05,259
I'm fucked up, Brad.

2498
01:52:05,803 --> 01:52:08,429
- Gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Fucked up.

2499
01:52:13,268 --> 01:52:14,769
- It's a joke.
- It's a joke?

2500
01:52:14,853 --> 01:52:16,813
- I'm sober.
- Jesus fucking Christ!

2501
01:52:16,897 --> 01:52:17,897
It's a fucking joke.

2502
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:19,565
- Are you fucking stupid?
- I'm not stupid.

2503
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,109
You fucking drive in here
like a fucking maniac,

2504
01:52:21,193 --> 01:52:23,027
you know the attention that
that fucking draws?

2505
01:52:23,112 --> 01:52:25,780
- I'm not stupid. I'm smart.
- Smart?

2506
01:52:25,864 --> 01:52:27,949
- I make million-dollar deals.
- That right?

2507
01:52:28,033 --> 01:52:30,410
With smart important people,
unlike you.

2508
01:52:30,494 --> 01:52:34,372
People who don't sucker-punch people
when they're scared. Okay?

2509
01:52:34,456 --> 01:52:35,832
- I'm scared, huh?
- And by the way,

2510
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:36,916
I haven't gotten an apology yet for that.

2511
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,042
You want an apology, okay.

2512
01:52:38,127 --> 01:52:39,544
I check my fucking messages every day

2513
01:52:39,628 --> 01:52:40,586
- when I come home from work.
- Did you?

2514
01:52:40,671 --> 01:52:41,921
- My answering machine. Zero.
- Didn't get one, huh?

2515
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:43,047
I got a blinking light,

2516
01:52:43,132 --> 01:52:44,424
because I don't have shit from you.

2517
01:52:44,508 --> 01:52:45,716
You know what, you got
a big fucking mouth, okay?

2518
01:52:45,801 --> 01:52:47,051
I got my wife checking the messages

2519
01:52:47,136 --> 01:52:49,137
every 45 minutes
calling the office, saying,

2520
01:52:49,221 --> 01:52:50,430
"Has Brad apologized yet?

2521
01:52:50,514 --> 01:52:52,515
"Is there an apology message
on the machine?"

2522
01:52:52,599 --> 01:52:54,142
I don't have jack shit. You know what?

2523
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:55,643
That's not how you treat people.

2524
01:52:55,727 --> 01:52:56,769
You got a big fucking mouth, you know.

2525
01:52:56,854 --> 01:52:58,521
I'm gonna give you a fucking pass.
Just give me the case.

2526
01:52:58,605 --> 01:53:00,815
You're gonna give me a pass?

2527
01:53:00,899 --> 01:53:02,483
Look, it's a figure of fucking speech.

2528
01:53:02,568 --> 01:53:04,527
Oh, my gosh. The Emperor of Fucksville

2529
01:53:04,611 --> 01:53:05,903
came down from Fucksville
to give me a pass!

2530
01:53:05,988 --> 01:53:06,988
From Fucksville, huh?

2531
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:08,948
Hey, what are the citizens
of Fucksville doing today

2532
01:53:09,032 --> 01:53:10,491
when their Emperor's gone?

2533
01:53:10,576 --> 01:53:12,118
Is it mayhem?

2534
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:13,995
Are people looting and raping?

2535
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:16,080
What are all the little fuckheads
doing while you're here?

2536
01:53:16,165 --> 01:53:17,582
Go fuck yourself! Give me the bag.

2537
01:53:17,666 --> 01:53:18,958
You back the fuck up.

2538
01:53:19,042 --> 01:53:22,503
I'll cause the biggest fucking scene
that I've ever caused in my life

2539
01:53:22,588 --> 01:53:24,338
if you come at me again.

2540
01:53:24,423 --> 01:53:26,007
- You know what?
- Just fucking keep it down.

2541
01:53:26,091 --> 01:53:27,300
I got...

2542
01:53:27,384 --> 01:53:31,971
I don't wanna be out of line or anything,
but I think you like, like me. Like you...

2543
01:53:32,055 --> 01:53:33,514
Like when you come at me...

2544
01:53:33,599 --> 01:53:34,682
What's the matter with you?
What the fuck is...

2545
01:53:34,766 --> 01:53:36,184
...and you look at me.
I swear I just noticed it.

2546
01:53:36,268 --> 01:53:37,977
You have like a fucking, like...

2547
01:53:38,061 --> 01:53:40,062
Like a twinkle. You have like a twinkle.

2548
01:53:40,147 --> 01:53:41,606
Are you trying to kiss me, bro?

2549
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:43,274
Jesus fucking Christ.

2550
01:53:43,358 --> 01:53:45,318
- What's with you?
- I have a... I don't know.

2551
01:53:45,402 --> 01:53:47,111
- It's not a homophobic thing.
- All right...

2552
01:53:47,196 --> 01:53:48,905
You're just not the one for me, pal.

2553
01:53:48,989 --> 01:53:50,114
You know what I mean? It's not...

2554
01:53:50,199 --> 01:53:52,116
- It's not about that for me, you know.
- I've heard enough.

2555
01:53:52,201 --> 01:53:54,619
Please, I'm begging,
give me the fucking case.

2556
01:53:54,703 --> 01:53:56,078
- I'm gonna give you the case.
- Give me the case.

2557
01:53:56,163 --> 01:53:57,538
- You gotta do me one favor.
- What's that?

2558
01:53:57,623 --> 01:54:00,917
You gotta take this case,
you gotta drive straight home,

2559
01:54:01,001 --> 01:54:04,504
need you to open up the briefcase,
and you take out every single dollar.

2560
01:54:04,588 --> 01:54:06,547
Don't leave one dollar
inside the briefcase.

2561
01:54:06,632 --> 01:54:07,757
And once you have it all

2562
01:54:07,841 --> 01:54:09,634
neatly organized outside the briefcase,

2563
01:54:09,718 --> 01:54:12,011
I need you to take it
and I need you to shove it right up

2564
01:54:12,095 --> 01:54:14,180
your wife's Latvian cunt,
you understand?

2565
01:54:14,264 --> 01:54:15,932
- My fucking wife!
- Chill! Chill, bro.

2566
01:54:16,016 --> 01:54:17,475
Fuck. You motherfucking piece of shit!

2567
01:54:17,559 --> 01:54:18,601
How about now?

2568
01:54:18,769 --> 01:54:20,144
- Go, go!
- Fuck!

2569
01:54:21,897 --> 01:54:23,606
Motherfuck! You're fucking dead!

2570
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:25,358
Stop! Don't move! Don't move!

2571
01:54:25,442 --> 01:54:28,277
Stop, or I will blow you the fuck away!

2572
01:54:28,695 --> 01:54:30,863
Drop the case!
Put your hands in the air!

2573
01:54:30,948 --> 01:54:32,073
Get down.

2574
01:54:32,866 --> 01:54:34,617
Get down on your knees!
Get down on your knees!

2575
01:54:35,327 --> 01:54:39,830
Motherfucker!

2576
01:54:49,007 --> 01:54:52,218
Jordan, do I have a surprise for you!

2577
01:54:52,469 --> 01:54:55,054
- What's that?
- Twenty real Lemmons.

2578
01:54:55,138 --> 01:54:56,305
Retired pharmacist's client of mine,

2579
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,557
they've been in the safe for 15 years.

2580
01:54:57,641 --> 01:54:59,100
Are you fucking kidding me? Lemmons?

2581
01:55:00,352 --> 01:55:02,228
They're gonna knock us
on our fucking heads.

2582
01:55:02,312 --> 01:55:07,233
When it comes to Quaaludes,
the Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail.

2583
01:55:07,317 --> 01:55:08,818
- Can you believe it?
- Oh, my God.

2584
01:55:08,902 --> 01:55:10,361
I thought they were like a myth.

2585
01:55:10,445 --> 01:55:12,321
Three times as powerful
as anything available today.

2586
01:55:12,406 --> 01:55:13,447
Look at these babies.

2587
01:55:13,532 --> 01:55:16,117
Boy, Donnie really knew
how to celebrate.

2588
01:55:16,201 --> 01:55:18,286
He said he was saving these
for a special occasion.

2589
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:20,955
Like a birthday, or being clap free,

2590
01:55:21,039 --> 01:55:24,000
or our money arriving
safely in Switzerland.

2591
01:55:27,421 --> 01:55:28,671
So that night,

2592
01:55:28,755 --> 01:55:30,590
I cleared my schedule and I rid my body

2593
01:55:30,674 --> 01:55:33,175
of anything that could fuck with my high.

2594
01:55:33,885 --> 01:55:35,678
It was celebration time.

2595
01:55:36,263 --> 01:55:37,430
Okay.

2596
01:55:37,514 --> 01:55:39,015
Start off with one, see how it goes?

2597
01:55:39,099 --> 01:55:40,850
My guy says all we'll need is one.

2598
01:55:40,934 --> 01:55:42,351
Here you go.

2599
01:55:43,061 --> 01:55:44,729
- Salud!
- Cheers.

2600
01:55:44,813 --> 01:55:47,607
Maybe if I pull it again, it'll go down.

2601
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:50,610
Steve! Steve!

2602
01:55:50,694 --> 01:55:51,944
I gotta get out of here!

2603
01:55:52,029 --> 01:55:53,904
Carl, I think I got it figured out.

2604
01:55:53,989 --> 01:55:57,700
It must be one pull for up
and two pulls for down.

2605
01:55:57,784 --> 01:55:59,035
Okay.

2606
01:56:07,377 --> 01:56:09,170
Do you feel anything?

2607
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,007
No.

2608
01:56:15,719 --> 01:56:17,553
It's been 35 minutes.

2609
01:56:20,057 --> 01:56:23,601
Maybe we've built up a tolerance
after all these years, huh?

2610
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:38,157
This is bullshit!

2611
01:56:38,241 --> 01:56:41,410
My metabolism's pumping.
I can't feel shit!

2612
01:56:41,495 --> 01:56:42,662
They're old.

2613
01:56:42,746 --> 01:56:44,914
You think they lost their potency, huh?

2614
01:56:44,998 --> 01:56:46,624
Check the bottle!

2615
01:56:49,461 --> 01:56:50,878
January '81.

2616
01:56:50,962 --> 01:56:52,046
They're fucking duds.

2617
01:56:52,130 --> 01:56:53,172
Fuck!

2618
01:56:53,256 --> 01:56:54,340
Let's take...

2619
01:56:54,424 --> 01:56:55,925
Let's take two more each.

2620
01:56:57,886 --> 01:57:00,429
- Jordan.
- Yeah, baby.

2621
01:57:04,101 --> 01:57:05,810
What are you two retards doing?

2622
01:57:05,894 --> 01:57:06,977
We're working out, honey.

2623
01:57:07,437 --> 01:57:09,021
Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.

2624
01:57:09,106 --> 01:57:10,106
Okay.

2625
01:57:10,190 --> 01:57:12,108
- Okay?
- Okay.

2626
01:57:13,610 --> 01:57:15,152
Hey, Bo, what's going on?

2627
01:57:15,237 --> 01:57:16,362
Jordan, listen to me clearly.

2628
01:57:16,446 --> 01:57:19,031
I cannot talk to you on this phone,
I have to talk to you.

2629
01:57:19,116 --> 01:57:20,616
Get out of here. What's going on?

2630
01:57:20,701 --> 01:57:24,036
Listen to me!
Leave the fucking house, Jordan,

2631
01:57:24,121 --> 01:57:25,788
and then call me from a pay phone.

2632
01:57:25,872 --> 01:57:27,832
This is not a fucking joke, Jordan.

2633
01:57:27,916 --> 01:57:29,542
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2634
01:57:30,043 --> 01:57:31,377
- Shit.
- What'd he say?

2635
01:57:31,461 --> 01:57:32,837
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

2636
01:57:32,921 --> 01:57:34,880
- I gotta go!
- Is everything okay, Jordan?

2637
01:57:45,308 --> 01:57:47,059
The closest pay phone I could get to

2638
01:57:47,144 --> 01:57:49,437
was at the Brookville Country Club.

2639
01:57:50,105 --> 01:57:52,064
It was a real WASP stronghold,

2640
01:57:52,149 --> 01:57:54,734
just a mile down the road
from my house.

2641
01:58:04,202 --> 01:58:05,619
Hey, Bo, what's up, it's me.
What's going on?

2642
01:58:05,704 --> 01:58:06,746
I'm at a pay phone. What's going on?

2643
01:58:06,830 --> 01:58:07,955
Listen to me carefully.

2644
01:58:08,039 --> 01:58:11,792
Please. Your little friend there, Brad,
your little buddy, he's in jail.

2645
01:58:12,461 --> 01:58:13,753
What the fuck's he in jail for?

2646
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:15,296
- What'd he do?
- I don't know what he did.

2647
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:16,714
My friends in Long Island told me

2648
01:58:16,798 --> 01:58:19,008
he got picked up
in some fucking shopping mall.

2649
01:58:19,092 --> 01:58:20,092
He got locked up by...

2650
01:58:20,177 --> 01:58:22,428
Wait, wait. Did you...
Did you say a shopping mall?

2651
01:58:22,512 --> 01:58:23,804
- Yeah.
- He was with Donnie.

2652
01:58:23,889 --> 01:58:25,264
He was supposed
to deliver some money,

2653
01:58:25,348 --> 01:58:26,891
- then that fucking fat piece of shit...
- Listen to me!

2654
01:58:26,975 --> 01:58:27,975
I gotta go fucking talk to him right now!

2655
01:58:28,059 --> 01:58:29,977
Listen to me! Don't go! Listen to me.

2656
01:58:30,061 --> 01:58:32,688
That guy Denham, that FBI agent guy,

2657
01:58:32,773 --> 01:58:35,065
somebody told me
he's got your phones tapped.

2658
01:58:35,150 --> 01:58:36,650
Your office and your home.

2659
01:58:36,735 --> 01:58:38,444
Don't talk on the motherfucking phone!

2660
01:58:38,528 --> 01:58:40,446
Okay. Fuck! I got it. I got it. I got it.

2661
01:58:40,906 --> 01:58:42,031
Jordan.

2662
01:58:42,574 --> 01:58:46,368
You didn't try to bribe
this fucking FBI agent, did you?

2663
01:58:46,453 --> 01:58:48,496
No, I didn't try to bribe an FBI agent.

2664
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:50,122
You think I'm that fucking stupid? No.

2665
01:58:50,207 --> 01:58:52,082
What the fuck did you say?
I can't understand you.

2666
01:58:52,167 --> 01:58:53,334
Say that again.

2667
01:58:53,418 --> 01:58:56,212
I said...

2668
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,798
What the fuck are you saying?

2669
01:58:59,382 --> 01:59:00,382
I said...

2670
01:59:00,467 --> 01:59:01,926
Are you fucking high?

2671
01:59:04,554 --> 01:59:07,181
Jordan, are you fucking high?

2672
01:59:08,016 --> 01:59:10,142
Jordan, do me a favor,
stay where you are.

2673
01:59:10,227 --> 01:59:11,852
Don't get behind the wheel of the car.

2674
01:59:11,937 --> 01:59:13,479
I'm gonna send Rocco over
to pick you up.

2675
01:59:13,563 --> 01:59:14,814
Jordan! Jordan!

2676
01:59:14,898 --> 01:59:17,149
After 15 years in storage,

2677
01:59:17,234 --> 01:59:20,194
the Lemmons had
developed a delayed fuse.

2678
01:59:20,278 --> 01:59:22,947
It took 90 minutes for
these little fuckers to kick in.

2679
01:59:23,031 --> 01:59:24,406
But once they did...

2680
01:59:25,951 --> 01:59:27,493
I mean, I had skipped the tingle phase

2681
01:59:27,577 --> 01:59:29,495
and went straight to the drool phase.

2682
01:59:29,579 --> 01:59:31,539
Tell me where you are!
Don't fucking drive...

2683
01:59:31,623 --> 01:59:33,541
These little bastards were so strong,

2684
01:59:33,625 --> 01:59:35,668
I discovered a whole new phase.

2685
01:59:35,752 --> 01:59:37,795
The cerebral palsy phase.

2686
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:42,091
Come on, stand up!

2687
01:59:46,054 --> 01:59:47,972
Okay, walking's out.

2688
01:59:48,932 --> 01:59:51,809
All right, think, think.
What else is there?

2689
01:59:52,644 --> 01:59:56,355
Yes! I can crawl. I can crawl like Skylar!

2690
02:00:28,013 --> 02:00:30,973
Fuck! The kid makes it look
so goddamn easy!

2691
02:00:38,023 --> 02:00:40,399
Think, you motherfucker, think!

2692
02:00:40,483 --> 02:00:41,817
Yes!

2693
02:00:41,902 --> 02:00:43,986
I got it! I've got it!

2694
02:00:44,404 --> 02:00:46,572
I can roll! I can roll!

2695
02:02:08,905 --> 02:02:13,075
Jordan.

2696
02:02:13,451 --> 02:02:15,119
Oh, Jesus. Where are you?

2697
02:02:15,203 --> 02:02:16,662
I'm at a country club!

2698
02:02:16,746 --> 02:02:17,788
What?

2699
02:02:17,872 --> 02:02:20,708
I'm at a country club!

2700
02:02:20,792 --> 02:02:22,126
I don't know what
the fuck you're saying.

2701
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:23,460
Look, you need to get home.

2702
02:02:23,545 --> 02:02:26,171
Donnie is out of control!
He's on the other line

2703
02:02:26,256 --> 02:02:28,132
with some Swiss guy. I don't know...

2704
02:02:28,216 --> 02:02:29,216
What?

2705
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:32,261
Get him off the phone!

2706
02:02:32,595 --> 02:02:35,347
I can't understand you!

2707
02:02:35,432 --> 02:02:36,682
Get him

2708
02:02:36,766 --> 02:02:37,808
off

2709
02:02:37,892 --> 02:02:39,018
the phone!

2710
02:02:39,102 --> 02:02:40,352
I don't know what the fuck
you're saying, Jordan.

2711
02:02:40,437 --> 02:02:41,770
Can you just get home? Hurry!

2712
02:02:51,614 --> 02:02:53,741
I was less than a mile from home.

2713
02:02:53,825 --> 02:02:56,535
I drove as slow as I fucking could.

2714
02:02:56,619 --> 02:02:58,620
I'd seen Jell-O move faster.

2715
02:02:58,705 --> 02:03:01,123
I was gonna give you two million.

2716
02:03:01,291 --> 02:03:03,834
I's gonna be lates.

2717
02:03:04,502 --> 02:03:06,086
You ate two million?

2718
02:03:07,005 --> 02:03:08,255
Later.

2719
02:03:08,339 --> 02:03:09,465
Get off the phone.

2720
02:03:09,549 --> 02:03:11,050
Get off the fucking phone! Idiot!

2721
02:03:12,427 --> 02:03:14,511
Get out of the way, asshole!

2722
02:03:17,182 --> 02:03:18,432
You hate two million?

2723
02:03:18,516 --> 02:03:20,017
No, you don't hate two million, Donnie.

2724
02:03:22,562 --> 02:03:25,439
By some miracle, I made it home alive,

2725
02:03:25,523 --> 02:03:27,816
not a scratch on me or the car.

2726
02:03:37,243 --> 02:03:38,327
Jordan?

2727
02:03:38,828 --> 02:03:41,413
Jesus fucking Christ!

2728
02:03:41,498 --> 02:03:42,998
What did you take?

2729
02:03:43,083 --> 02:03:44,374
What's wrong with you?

2730
02:03:44,459 --> 02:03:45,459
Jor!

2731
02:03:45,543 --> 02:03:47,920
It's fucking good, right?

2732
02:03:48,004 --> 02:03:49,338
Fucked up!

2733
02:03:50,673 --> 02:03:52,508
Get off the phone!

2734
02:03:55,553 --> 02:03:57,763
What the fuck, Jordan?

2735
02:03:57,847 --> 02:03:59,431
Your daughter's in the house!

2736
02:03:59,516 --> 02:04:00,599
I hope you know that!

2737
02:04:00,683 --> 02:04:02,017
Your fucking daughter's in the house!

2738
02:04:02,519 --> 02:04:03,852
Yeah, it's real fucking funny, Donnie.

2739
02:04:04,062 --> 02:04:06,480
Get off the phone!

2740
02:04:07,649 --> 02:04:08,607
Jesus Christ, Jordan.

2741
02:04:08,691 --> 02:04:10,359
The FBI!

2742
02:04:11,694 --> 02:04:12,945
Hey!

2743
02:04:13,488 --> 02:04:15,364
I'm on phone!

2744
02:04:15,573 --> 02:04:17,950
Get off the fucking phone!

2745
02:04:19,702 --> 02:04:21,703
- Come here!
...the phone.

2746
02:04:23,790 --> 02:04:26,917
Come on. We're gonna
go upstairs, all right.

2747
02:04:31,798 --> 02:04:33,298
I'm on the phone!

2748
02:04:33,383 --> 02:04:34,716
On the phone!

2749
02:04:34,801 --> 02:04:36,885
I know what you did,

2750
02:04:37,387 --> 02:04:38,804
you piece of shit!

2751
02:04:38,888 --> 02:04:40,597
What? What?

2752
02:04:40,682 --> 02:04:46,895
Brad!

2753
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:49,398
You fucking cocksucker!

2754
02:04:53,736 --> 02:04:55,612
What did you do,

2755
02:04:55,697 --> 02:04:57,489
you piece of shit?

2756
02:04:57,574 --> 02:04:58,991
Fuck you!

2757
02:05:00,243 --> 02:05:04,788
I wanna fucking kill you!

2758
02:05:05,748 --> 02:05:07,082
I got you!

2759
02:05:31,649 --> 02:05:33,567
What the fuck happened?

2760
02:05:34,027 --> 02:05:35,277
Oh, shit!

2761
02:05:35,361 --> 02:05:37,237
Jordan? Jordan, are you all right?

2762
02:05:37,405 --> 02:05:38,989
Donnie? Donnie?

2763
02:05:39,324 --> 02:05:40,407
Donnie?

2764
02:05:40,491 --> 02:05:41,825
Jordan, he's not breathing.

2765
02:05:41,910 --> 02:05:43,702
Oh, fuck, I don't know what to do.

2766
02:05:43,786 --> 02:05:45,037
Jordan, I don't know what the fuck to do!

2767
02:05:45,121 --> 02:05:46,455
I can't help him! Oh, my God. Jordan.

2768
02:05:48,499 --> 02:05:51,043
Oh, my God, I think he's choking,
Jordan. Do something.

2769
02:05:51,127 --> 02:05:52,878
- Oh, God.
- Baby, I got you!

2770
02:05:53,463 --> 02:05:56,340
He's not breathing, Jordan.
You gotta do something!

2771
02:05:57,258 --> 02:05:59,551
Shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

2772
02:06:01,471 --> 02:06:02,804
I got you.

2773
02:06:22,158 --> 02:06:23,742
Step aside!

2774
02:06:23,993 --> 02:06:27,287
Oh, God!

2775
02:06:27,664 --> 02:06:29,414
Move aside, baby.

2776
02:06:36,381 --> 02:06:38,173
Come on! Come on!

2777
02:06:38,258 --> 02:06:39,466
Come on!

2778
02:06:44,013 --> 02:06:46,682
Jordan, he's not breathing.
You gotta do something.

2779
02:06:47,725 --> 02:06:49,768
Jordan, he's a father!
He's got fucking kids!

2780
02:06:49,852 --> 02:06:51,520
- Do something!
- Yeah?

2781
02:06:57,193 --> 02:06:58,277
Rocco, you gotta get over here.

2782
02:06:58,361 --> 02:07:00,279
- Come on.
- Call an ambulance!

2783
02:07:00,363 --> 02:07:01,530
I don't fucking know!

2784
02:07:01,614 --> 02:07:03,365
Just get over here! Call 911.

2785
02:07:11,416 --> 02:07:12,416
Yeah.

2786
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:16,295
You all right? He's all right.

2787
02:07:29,475 --> 02:07:33,979
Mr. Belfort?

2788
02:07:36,649 --> 02:07:39,568
Get the fuck out of here. Fuck.

2789
02:07:39,652 --> 02:07:42,154
Sir, we need to ask you some questions.

2790
02:07:42,822 --> 02:07:44,781
Are you fucking kidding me? Fuck you.

2791
02:07:44,866 --> 02:07:45,991
Come on, get up.

2792
02:07:46,075 --> 02:07:47,617
Get the fuck out of my house.

2793
02:07:49,412 --> 02:07:51,121
- Let's go.
- I've been here all night.

2794
02:07:51,205 --> 02:07:52,706
I been sitting here all night.

2795
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:54,166
What the fuck are you talking about?

2796
02:07:54,250 --> 02:07:56,209
- Where you taking him?
- Where you taking me?

2797
02:07:56,294 --> 02:07:57,377
Where you taking him?

2798
02:07:57,462 --> 02:07:58,503
You ain't got no warrant.

2799
02:07:58,588 --> 02:07:59,880
Just come up
in people's house like that!

2800
02:08:01,049 --> 02:08:03,342
Did you drive your car tonight,
Mr. Belfort?

2801
02:08:04,927 --> 02:08:05,969
Well?

2802
02:08:09,265 --> 02:08:10,640
Wow!

2803
02:08:10,933 --> 02:08:12,726
Maybe I hadn't made it home okay.

2804
02:08:27,867 --> 02:08:30,243
Get out of the fucking way!

2805
02:08:32,205 --> 02:08:33,455
Fuck!

2806
02:08:39,087 --> 02:08:42,714
Did you drive that car tonight?

2807
02:08:43,841 --> 02:08:45,967
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right.

2808
02:08:46,052 --> 02:08:47,844
I'm a family man!

2809
02:08:47,929 --> 02:08:49,679
Family man. Honey!

2810
02:08:49,764 --> 02:08:51,723
It was a miracle I wasn't killed,

2811
02:08:51,808 --> 02:08:54,810
or that I didn't kill anybody else.

2812
02:08:54,894 --> 02:08:58,063
The cops took me in for questioning,
but they couldn't charge me.

2813
02:08:58,147 --> 02:09:00,565
They had no proof
I was even behind the wheel.

2814
02:09:00,650 --> 02:09:01,733
Meanwhile,

2815
02:09:01,818 --> 02:09:03,902
Brad did three months
in jail for contempt

2816
02:09:03,986 --> 02:09:06,571
because he wouldn't rat Donnie out.

2817
02:09:06,656 --> 02:09:09,366
The result, I was scot-free.

2818
02:09:09,450 --> 02:09:11,827
But I had eyes on me like never before.

2819
02:09:11,911 --> 02:09:13,578
You're a lucky man, Jordan.

2820
02:09:13,663 --> 02:09:16,581
You're lucky to be alive,
let alone not in jail.

2821
02:09:16,666 --> 02:09:18,250
You know I don't believe in luck, right?

2822
02:09:18,334 --> 02:09:19,668
But it's time.

2823
02:09:19,752 --> 02:09:22,003
Please, let me call the SEC
and cut a deal

2824
02:09:22,088 --> 02:09:24,005
before your luck runs out.

2825
02:09:24,090 --> 02:09:25,674
Wave to Daddy.

2826
02:09:25,758 --> 02:09:26,842
Hey.

2827
02:09:26,926 --> 02:09:28,427
Hey, sweetie.

2828
02:09:33,641 --> 02:09:36,935
What kind of terms
would you be talking about if I...

2829
02:09:37,019 --> 02:09:38,228
I don't know.

2830
02:09:38,312 --> 02:09:41,273
You plead guilty to a handful
of securities violations,

2831
02:09:41,357 --> 02:09:44,401
stock manipulation,
high-pressure sales tactics.

2832
02:09:44,485 --> 02:09:47,279
Ticky-tack shit like that, you know.

2833
02:09:47,363 --> 02:09:49,322
You pay a couple
million dollars in fines,

2834
02:09:49,407 --> 02:09:52,367
in exchange, the SEC
fucks off till the end of time.

2835
02:09:54,704 --> 02:09:56,329
And Stratton?

2836
02:09:56,831 --> 02:09:58,707
What happens to Stratton?

2837
02:09:58,791 --> 02:10:01,626
There's no way... I mean...
You got to walk away. Right?

2838
02:10:01,711 --> 02:10:02,836
Let Donnie be in charge.

2839
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,546
Right. Donnie.

2840
02:10:05,256 --> 02:10:07,424
Now the FBI is
another animal completely.

2841
02:10:07,508 --> 02:10:09,301
They'll still be pursuing you
for criminal wrongdoing.

2842
02:10:09,385 --> 02:10:12,137
However, with you
stepping down voluntarily,

2843
02:10:12,221 --> 02:10:14,139
my guess is that
your best friend Agent Denham

2844
02:10:14,223 --> 02:10:16,558
will be standing around
with his dick in his hand.

2845
02:10:17,685 --> 02:10:18,977
Jordan.

2846
02:10:19,061 --> 02:10:20,979
What do you have to think about?

2847
02:10:21,063 --> 02:10:22,647
You beat them.

2848
02:10:22,732 --> 02:10:23,857
You won!

2849
02:10:23,941 --> 02:10:25,567
God knows you never
have to work again.

2850
02:10:25,651 --> 02:10:27,652
What're you gonna do?
Spend the rest of your life in jail?

2851
02:10:27,737 --> 02:10:28,820
- Is that what you want?
- No.

2852
02:10:28,905 --> 02:10:29,946
- Of course not.
- Okay.

2853
02:10:30,031 --> 02:10:32,073
Okay! You got
all the money in the world.

2854
02:10:32,158 --> 02:10:33,742
You need everybody else's money?

2855
02:10:33,826 --> 02:10:35,243
- Of course not, Pops.
- Well?

2856
02:10:35,328 --> 02:10:37,662
- You know, I built it.
- I know you built it.

2857
02:10:37,747 --> 02:10:39,456
You built it, so now preserve it.

2858
02:11:10,696 --> 02:11:12,113
You know,

2859
02:11:12,490 --> 02:11:15,200
five years ago,
when I started Stratton Oakmont

2860
02:11:15,284 --> 02:11:17,369
with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day

2861
02:11:17,453 --> 02:11:20,747
would eventually come
where I'd have to be moving on.

2862
02:11:22,708 --> 02:11:26,503
And it's truly with a heavy heart
that I'm here to say that...

2863
02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:30,298
That that day is finally here.

2864
02:11:34,512 --> 02:11:36,805
I wanna... I want
to thank you all for your...

2865
02:11:36,889 --> 02:11:39,558
Your years of loyalty and admiration.

2866
02:11:39,642 --> 02:11:41,101
But the point is this.

2867
02:11:42,061 --> 02:11:43,311
Under Donnie's leadership,

2868
02:11:43,396 --> 02:11:46,856
along with Nicky Koskoff
and Robbie Feinberg

2869
02:11:46,941 --> 02:11:49,734
moving into key management positions,
this place really

2870
02:11:49,819 --> 02:11:51,152
is gonna be better than ever!

2871
02:11:51,237 --> 02:11:53,363
That I promise you. Okay?

2872
02:11:53,739 --> 02:11:56,241
Give them a round of applause.
Come on.

2873
02:11:59,328 --> 02:12:02,080
This is Ellis Island here, people.

2874
02:12:02,164 --> 02:12:03,832
I don't care who you are,
where you're from,

2875
02:12:03,916 --> 02:12:06,418
whether your relatives
came over on the fucking Mayflower

2876
02:12:06,502 --> 02:12:08,670
or on an inner tube from Haiti,

2877
02:12:08,754 --> 02:12:11,006
this right here is the land of opportunity.

2878
02:12:11,090 --> 02:12:13,592
Stratton Oakmont is America!

2879
02:12:17,638 --> 02:12:19,264
All of you know Kimmie Belzer, right?

2880
02:12:19,348 --> 02:12:20,557
Yes, we do.

2881
02:12:20,641 --> 02:12:21,766
Fuck you.

2882
02:12:22,435 --> 02:12:23,643
Come on, Kimmie.

2883
02:12:23,728 --> 02:12:25,270
What you probably didn't know is,

2884
02:12:25,354 --> 02:12:27,147
Kimmie was one of
the first brokers here,

2885
02:12:27,231 --> 02:12:29,524
one of Stratton's original 20.

2886
02:12:30,276 --> 02:12:32,110
Now most of you met Kimmie,

2887
02:12:32,194 --> 02:12:35,196
the beautiful sophisticated woman
that she is today.

2888
02:12:35,615 --> 02:12:38,700
A woman that wears
$3,000 Armani suits.

2889
02:12:40,703 --> 02:12:43,246
Who drives a brand-new
Mercedes-Benz.

2890
02:12:43,956 --> 02:12:45,790
A woman who spends

2891
02:12:45,875 --> 02:12:47,292
her winters in the Bahamas

2892
02:12:47,376 --> 02:12:49,502
and summers in the Hamptons!

2893
02:12:54,508 --> 02:12:56,843
That's not the Kimmie that I met.

2894
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:03,433
The Kimmie that I met
didn't have two nickels to rub together.

2895
02:13:04,685 --> 02:13:06,936
She was a single mom
on the balls of her ass

2896
02:13:07,021 --> 02:13:08,813
with an eight-year-old son.

2897
02:13:08,898 --> 02:13:11,900
Okay? She was
three months behind on her rent.

2898
02:13:12,985 --> 02:13:16,655
And when she came to me
and asked me for a job,

2899
02:13:16,739 --> 02:13:18,948
she asked for a $5,000 advance

2900
02:13:19,033 --> 02:13:22,202
just so she could pay her son's tuition.

2901
02:13:26,666 --> 02:13:28,375
And what'd I do, Kimmie?

2902
02:13:28,459 --> 02:13:30,168
Go on, tell them.

2903
02:13:31,921 --> 02:13:33,963
You wrote me a check

2904
02:13:34,215 --> 02:13:36,299
for $25,000.

2905
02:13:37,593 --> 02:13:39,052
That's right.

2906
02:13:39,178 --> 02:13:40,512
Thank you.

2907
02:13:43,933 --> 02:13:45,684
And you know why that is?

2908
02:13:49,021 --> 02:13:51,314
It's because I believed in you.

2909
02:13:53,025 --> 02:13:55,735
It's because I believed in you, Kimmie,

2910
02:13:56,153 --> 02:14:00,031
just like I believe in each
and every one of you here today.

2911
02:14:00,116 --> 02:14:02,534
- I fucking love you, Jordan!
- I fucking love you.

2912
02:14:02,618 --> 02:14:04,411
I fucking love you! I love you.

2913
02:14:04,495 --> 02:14:07,288
I fucking love you, too!
I fucking love you, too!

2914
02:14:10,209 --> 02:14:12,210
And I love all of you!

2915
02:14:12,795 --> 02:14:15,130
And I love all of you
from the bottom of my heart.

2916
02:14:15,214 --> 02:14:17,674
- I fucking love you, too.
- I mean that.

2917
02:14:18,509 --> 02:14:20,802
You are the shit.
You are the fucking shit.

2918
02:14:27,309 --> 02:14:29,477
It's a shame, you know.

2919
02:14:31,063 --> 02:14:35,191
For years, I've been telling you guys
never to take no for an answer, right?

2920
02:14:35,276 --> 02:14:38,486
You know, to keep pushing,
to never hang up the phone

2921
02:14:39,405 --> 02:14:41,656
until you get what you want.

2922
02:14:42,533 --> 02:14:44,284
Because you all deserve it.

2923
02:14:46,328 --> 02:14:49,497
You know, this fucking deal
that I'm about to sign

2924
02:14:49,999 --> 02:14:52,125
barring me from the securities industry,

2925
02:14:52,209 --> 02:14:54,252
barring me from Stratton,

2926
02:14:55,337 --> 02:14:56,755
my home.

2927
02:14:59,508 --> 02:15:01,509
What the fuck is that, you know?

2928
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:05,054
I'll tell you what it is. It's...

2929
02:15:05,806 --> 02:15:08,600
It's me taking no
for an answer, you know.

2930
02:15:10,102 --> 02:15:11,352
It's them...

2931
02:15:11,437 --> 02:15:14,689
It's them selling me,
not the other way around.

2932
02:15:15,441 --> 02:15:18,151
It's me being a hypocrite is what it is.

2933
02:15:23,324 --> 02:15:24,574
So...

2934
02:15:31,707 --> 02:15:33,249
You know what?

2935
02:15:37,046 --> 02:15:42,258
I'm not leaving.

2936
02:15:45,221 --> 02:15:46,387
I'm not fucking leaving!

2937
02:15:51,435 --> 02:15:53,853
You're not getting a fucking promotion!

2938
02:15:55,231 --> 02:15:56,564
The show goes on!

2939
02:15:59,193 --> 02:16:00,610
This is my home!

2940
02:16:00,694 --> 02:16:03,446
They're gonna need
a fucking wrecking ball

2941
02:16:03,531 --> 02:16:05,406
to take me out of here!

2942
02:16:07,409 --> 02:16:09,911
They're gonna need to
send in the National Guard

2943
02:16:09,995 --> 02:16:11,746
or fucking SWAT team

2944
02:16:11,831 --> 02:16:14,332
'cause I ain't going nowhere!

2945
02:16:17,169 --> 02:16:22,423
Fuck them!

2946
02:16:56,542 --> 02:16:58,334
Jordy! Jordy!

2947
02:16:58,460 --> 02:17:00,461
Jordy! Get back here!

2948
02:17:01,297 --> 02:17:02,463
Hey!

2949
02:17:04,925 --> 02:17:06,175
Give me that.

2950
02:17:08,679 --> 02:17:09,804
What is this?

2951
02:17:09,889 --> 02:17:12,390
Ramar of the Jungle, for Christ sake?

2952
02:17:13,475 --> 02:17:16,394
Paddy D, mazel tov, you Irishman.

2953
02:17:16,478 --> 02:17:19,939
Jordan Belfort just welched
on his deal with the SEC.

2954
02:17:20,024 --> 02:17:22,692
He is back in the ocean. Happy hunting.

2955
02:17:35,623 --> 02:17:37,916
It was our time to party big.

2956
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,627
And just as Brad
was released from jail, too.

2957
02:17:41,462 --> 02:17:45,423
I apologized, even offered to
pay him for his time in the can.

2958
02:17:46,008 --> 02:17:48,092
But he said no, that he was out.

2959
02:17:48,177 --> 02:17:50,053
He didn't want any part of us.

2960
02:17:50,137 --> 02:17:51,763
Sad thing was,

2961
02:17:51,847 --> 02:17:55,058
two years later he was dead.

2962
02:17:55,225 --> 02:17:57,644
Massive heart attack. Thirty-five.

2963
02:17:58,437 --> 02:18:00,772
Same age Mozart died.

2964
02:18:00,856 --> 02:18:04,108
Not that they have a hell
of a lot in common, but...

2965
02:18:04,193 --> 02:18:06,527
Anyway, I don't know
why that came to mind.

2966
02:18:08,697 --> 02:18:12,283
Within days, subpoenas started flying.

2967
02:18:12,368 --> 02:18:15,703
Notices to produce documents,
depositions, you name it.

2968
02:18:15,788 --> 02:18:17,789
Donnie couldn't drink water fast enough.

2969
02:18:17,873 --> 02:18:20,333
United States government
wants to give me a subpoena?

2970
02:18:20,417 --> 02:18:23,711
Here's what we do
with subpoenas at Stratton Oakmont!

2971
02:18:29,468 --> 02:18:32,095
Fuck you, USA! Fuck you!

2972
02:18:32,179 --> 02:18:34,055
Fuck you! Fuck you!

2973
02:18:34,139 --> 02:18:35,932
Fuck you!

2974
02:18:43,691 --> 02:18:45,733
Jordan Belfort.

2975
02:18:45,818 --> 02:18:47,694
Alden. That's a nice name.

2976
02:18:47,778 --> 02:18:49,070
Thank you very much for that.

2977
02:18:49,154 --> 02:18:51,322
- What kind of name is that?
- That is my name.

2978
02:18:51,407 --> 02:18:53,074
I do not recall that.

2979
02:18:53,158 --> 02:18:55,493
I do not recall that. Okay?

2980
02:18:55,577 --> 02:18:57,745
Mr. Ming, thank you for coming in today.

2981
02:18:57,830 --> 02:18:59,455
Are you gonna finish
the rest of that Danish?

2982
02:18:59,540 --> 02:19:00,748
- Can I have that Danish?
- No, no, go ahead.

2983
02:19:00,833 --> 02:19:02,500
They interrogated everybody.

2984
02:19:02,584 --> 02:19:04,210
I got a low blood sugar, thyroid thing.

2985
02:19:04,294 --> 02:19:05,461
It went on for months.

2986
02:19:05,546 --> 02:19:07,588
It was a total fucking harassment.

2987
02:19:07,673 --> 02:19:09,215
Tell him to proceed with the questions.

2988
02:19:09,299 --> 02:19:11,759
But not a single Strattonite cracked.

2989
02:19:11,844 --> 02:19:13,511
Gladys Carrera?

2990
02:19:13,595 --> 02:19:15,138
Doesn't ring a bell.

2991
02:19:15,222 --> 02:19:17,849
Sorry, I have
no recommendation of that.

2992
02:19:18,017 --> 02:19:19,017
No.

2993
02:19:19,101 --> 02:19:20,101
No idea.

2994
02:19:20,185 --> 02:19:22,687
I don't recall that transaction.
You guys have any milk?

2995
02:19:22,771 --> 02:19:25,023
Absolutely not.

2996
02:19:25,107 --> 02:19:26,941
Francis Sortigi
you called so many times

2997
02:19:27,026 --> 02:19:29,235
I just thought you might remember that.

2998
02:19:29,319 --> 02:19:30,820
Would you remember any of those?

2999
02:19:30,904 --> 02:19:32,655
- I do not recall any of that.
- This Abdul...

3000
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:34,907
I do not... No, I don't recall.

3001
02:19:34,992 --> 02:19:36,659
It was a long phone call.

3002
02:19:36,744 --> 02:19:38,411
I just wondered if you have
any memory of that.

3003
02:19:38,495 --> 02:19:41,664
Okay. You know we've talked to
several of the employees at this firm

3004
02:19:41,749 --> 02:19:45,043
and nobody can recall anything
about this Steve Madden IPO.

3005
02:19:45,127 --> 02:19:46,377
I think it's odd.

3006
02:19:48,255 --> 02:19:50,757
Do you recall Cartage Corporation?

3007
02:19:52,259 --> 02:19:53,509
You do recall it?

3008
02:19:53,594 --> 02:19:54,886
No, I don't recall that at all.

3009
02:19:55,471 --> 02:19:58,389
Excuse me. I have to ask.
Is that your real hair?

3010
02:19:59,016 --> 02:20:01,142
Are you gonna say anything about that?

3011
02:20:01,226 --> 02:20:02,518
Are you gonna comment on my hair?

3012
02:20:02,603 --> 02:20:04,312
Is that how we're doing...
Is this personal questions?

3013
02:20:04,396 --> 02:20:06,064
I'm just wondering why you would
wear something like that.

3014
02:20:06,148 --> 02:20:07,982
Sorry. I don't recall that company.

3015
02:20:10,069 --> 02:20:11,819
Can I get you anything else, gentlemen?

3016
02:20:11,904 --> 02:20:13,738
Yes. Sweetheart, I have a rare condition

3017
02:20:13,822 --> 02:20:17,241
which requires me to drink one of those
every 15 minutes, please.

3018
02:20:17,701 --> 02:20:20,828
We were specifically advised
not to leave the country.

3019
02:20:20,913 --> 02:20:22,955
So, we took our wives to Italy.

3020
02:20:23,332 --> 02:20:25,750
We figured we were safer
working from overseas

3021
02:20:25,834 --> 02:20:27,210
giving orders to Rugrat.

3022
02:20:27,294 --> 02:20:29,462
Nobody could arrest us
and nobody could prove

3023
02:20:29,546 --> 02:20:31,547
I was still running Stratton from a yacht.

3024
02:20:31,632 --> 02:20:32,882
Hey, Rugrat.

3025
02:20:32,966 --> 02:20:34,133
Bonjour.

3026
02:20:34,218 --> 02:20:36,219
You bald-headed eagle, how you doing?

3027
02:20:36,303 --> 02:20:37,261
Donnie, Donnie, listen!

3028
02:20:37,346 --> 02:20:38,638
We have a problem, okay.

3029
02:20:38,722 --> 02:20:41,974
Your friend, Steve Madden,
is unloading shares.

3030
02:20:42,059 --> 02:20:44,102
What are you saying?
Who told you that?

3031
02:20:44,186 --> 02:20:45,770
- What's going on?
- He's doing it, Donnie!

3032
02:20:45,854 --> 02:20:48,314
He said that
Steve Madden's unloading shares.

3033
02:20:48,398 --> 02:20:49,524
Who told you that? It's bullshit!

3034
02:20:49,608 --> 02:20:51,943
Give me that goddamn phone.

3035
02:20:52,027 --> 02:20:53,569
What's going on?

3036
02:20:53,779 --> 02:20:55,863
Jordan, look. I'm watching the screen

3037
02:20:55,948 --> 02:20:58,658
and huge chunks of Steve Madden
are being sold, okay.

3038
02:20:58,742 --> 02:21:00,785
It's not coming from us,
so it's gotta be Steve.

3039
02:21:00,869 --> 02:21:02,912
He's the only person
with that many shares.

3040
02:21:02,996 --> 02:21:03,955
It's Donnie. Call me back, all right.

3041
02:21:04,039 --> 02:21:06,374
Donnie, your little friend
is trying to fuck me, you know that.

3042
02:21:06,500 --> 02:21:08,209
Your little friend is trying to
fuck me right in the ass.

3043
02:21:08,293 --> 02:21:09,877
- Get him on the phone now!
- We don't know anything yet.

3044
02:21:09,962 --> 02:21:11,337
Let's not jump to conclusions.

3045
02:21:11,839 --> 02:21:13,548
Even though I owned 85%

3046
02:21:13,632 --> 02:21:16,676
of Steve-cocksucking-
motherfucking-Madden Shoes,

3047
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:19,011
the shares were in his fucking name.

3048
02:21:19,096 --> 02:21:21,305
This motherfucker knew
I was in trouble with the feds

3049
02:21:21,390 --> 02:21:23,182
and was trying to take advantage.

3050
02:21:23,267 --> 02:21:24,767
Talk to me, man.
How do you wanna play this?

3051
02:21:24,852 --> 02:21:26,602
I want you to get
all our clients on the phone right now

3052
02:21:26,687 --> 02:21:27,979
and have them start
selling Steve Madden.

3053
02:21:28,063 --> 02:21:29,522
We're gonna drive
that fucking price down!

3054
02:21:29,606 --> 02:21:31,107
Do you hear me? Shut the fuck up!

3055
02:21:31,233 --> 02:21:32,859
This is your fucking friend
from high school.

3056
02:21:33,026 --> 02:21:35,111
If that little fucking prick
thinks he can fuck with me,

3057
02:21:35,195 --> 02:21:37,780
we'll turn his company
into a penny stock! You hear me?

3058
02:21:37,865 --> 02:21:39,282
- You got it?
- Yes. I got it!

3059
02:21:39,366 --> 02:21:42,285
Let's just not jump to conclusions
before we know what's going on.

3060
02:21:42,369 --> 02:21:44,912
Captain Ted!

3061
02:21:45,414 --> 02:21:47,790
Hang up your phones! Everybody, hey!

3062
02:21:47,875 --> 02:21:50,626
Turn the boat around!
We're going home!

3063
02:21:53,755 --> 02:21:56,132
Baby! Baby, what happened?

3064
02:21:56,425 --> 02:21:57,675
I just...

3065
02:21:58,093 --> 02:21:59,343
Sweetheart, what's going on?

3066
02:22:00,470 --> 02:22:02,096
Aunt Emma...

3067
02:22:02,973 --> 02:22:04,265
Just wait.

3068
02:22:04,683 --> 02:22:06,309
I can't...

3069
02:22:06,393 --> 02:22:09,270
What's going on? Why you crying?

3070
02:22:09,354 --> 02:22:11,397
- She's dead!
- Who? Who's dead?

3071
02:22:11,481 --> 02:22:13,858
I just got a call from my cousin Betty.

3072
02:22:13,942 --> 02:22:15,026
Yeah?

3073
02:22:15,110 --> 02:22:16,819
Aunt Emma is dead.

3074
02:22:18,238 --> 02:22:20,948
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No.

3075
02:22:21,283 --> 02:22:22,450
You're serious?

3076
02:22:23,243 --> 02:22:25,536
Oh, my God! Baby, that's...

3077
02:22:25,621 --> 02:22:27,079
Oh, fuck!

3078
02:22:27,164 --> 02:22:28,956
Oh, sweetheart, that's just...

3079
02:22:29,041 --> 02:22:30,374
Fucking heart attack!

3080
02:22:30,459 --> 02:22:32,043
Boom, snap, gone.

3081
02:22:32,127 --> 02:22:33,961
Shuffled off her mortal coil.

3082
02:22:34,046 --> 02:22:37,381
And $20 million stuck
in a Swiss bank account.

3083
02:22:37,466 --> 02:22:39,550
The last time I talked
to her she was fine!

3084
02:22:39,635 --> 02:22:41,802
- She's not that old.
- Oh, God! Baby, oh, God!

3085
02:22:41,887 --> 02:22:44,055
That's so fucking terrible!

3086
02:22:44,139 --> 02:22:45,848
Oh, fuck!

3087
02:22:45,933 --> 02:22:46,933
It is terrible.

3088
02:22:47,017 --> 02:22:49,560
Your aunt was such an elegant,
attractive woman.

3089
02:22:49,645 --> 02:22:51,562
My condolences to you and your family.

3090
02:22:51,647 --> 02:22:52,980
Yes. We're absolutely devastated.

3091
02:22:53,065 --> 02:22:55,066
Thank you so much
for your condolences.

3092
02:22:55,150 --> 02:22:58,069
Now where does that leave us
in regard to her account exactly?

3093
02:22:58,153 --> 02:22:59,654
Does it go into probate or what?

3094
02:22:59,738 --> 02:23:01,322
Not to worry, Jordan. Not to worry.

3095
02:23:01,406 --> 02:23:03,074
Your aunt, before she died,

3096
02:23:03,158 --> 02:23:06,077
signed a document
naming you as her successor.

3097
02:23:06,328 --> 02:23:07,828
She did?

3098
02:23:07,913 --> 02:23:09,538
Fantastic! Well, that's good news!

3099
02:23:09,831 --> 02:23:11,999
Well, not as of yet.

3100
02:23:12,334 --> 02:23:14,335
What does that mean? Not as of yet?

3101
02:23:16,755 --> 02:23:18,464
I can't seem to hear you.

3102
02:23:18,548 --> 02:23:21,259
I must have bad reception.
Are you speaking English?

3103
02:23:21,426 --> 02:23:24,095
- Very... Now. Fast. Very fast.
- Fast?

3104
02:23:24,179 --> 02:23:26,305
I have to get to Switzerland now?

3105
02:23:28,016 --> 02:23:30,101
Speak English! Fucking speak English!

3106
02:23:30,185 --> 02:23:31,477
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Quiet, okay?

3107
02:23:31,561 --> 02:23:33,020
Take your suit, take your dick, okay,

3108
02:23:33,105 --> 02:23:34,814
- and move your ass! Please.
- Okay.

3109
02:23:35,857 --> 02:23:36,899
Move my ass! Yes!

3110
02:23:36,984 --> 02:23:41,112
I gotta say, these Swiss were
some sneaky motherfuckers.

3111
02:23:41,196 --> 02:23:43,114
Within minutes,
he had me set up with a forger

3112
02:23:43,198 --> 02:23:45,199
who could fake Aunt Emma's signature.

3113
02:23:45,284 --> 02:23:46,826
You American shit!

3114
02:23:46,994 --> 02:23:50,371
I just had to get there by tomorrow,
or lose $20 million.

3115
02:23:50,455 --> 02:23:52,164
We're going to Monaco!

3116
02:23:52,708 --> 02:23:55,001
- Monaco? Now?
- Yes, baby.

3117
02:23:55,085 --> 02:23:57,670
We're going to Monaco,
so then we can go to Switzerland, okay?

3118
02:23:57,754 --> 02:23:59,463
- But her aunt just died.
- I realize that.

3119
02:23:59,548 --> 02:24:02,466
But I have business in Switzerland.
I need to go to Switzerland right now.

3120
02:24:02,551 --> 02:24:04,635
Bottom line. Sorry.

3121
02:24:04,928 --> 02:24:06,721
We gotta get to London.

3122
02:24:07,222 --> 02:24:08,472
Why? Why?

3123
02:24:09,975 --> 02:24:11,142
The funeral!

3124
02:24:11,226 --> 02:24:12,560
Yeah, but, babe. Look, look...

3125
02:24:13,061 --> 02:24:15,813
I loved your aunt
more than anyone in the entire world.

3126
02:24:15,897 --> 02:24:17,398
I really did.

3127
02:24:17,899 --> 02:24:20,151
But she's dead now, sweetie.

3128
02:24:20,235 --> 02:24:22,445
She's dead
and she's not going anywhere.

3129
02:24:22,529 --> 02:24:24,905
She'll still be dead by the time
we get to London, okay?

3130
02:24:25,574 --> 02:24:27,325
Captain Ted!
Captain Ted, all right, look.

3131
02:24:27,409 --> 02:24:29,201
We're going to Monaco.
Monaco now, okay?

3132
02:24:29,286 --> 02:24:30,328
Monaco, right.

3133
02:24:30,412 --> 02:24:32,288
We're going to Monaco
so that we can drive to Switzerland

3134
02:24:32,372 --> 02:24:33,664
so they don't stamp our passports.

3135
02:24:33,749 --> 02:24:35,624
Take care of business here,
we'll drive back to Monaco,

3136
02:24:35,709 --> 02:24:37,376
take a flight over to London
to catch the funeral

3137
02:24:37,461 --> 02:24:38,961
and be in New York
in three fucking business days!

3138
02:24:39,046 --> 02:24:40,212
That's the fucking plan.

3139
02:24:40,297 --> 02:24:42,673
I just want you to know that
we might run into some chop.

3140
02:24:42,758 --> 02:24:44,967
Chop? We can fucking
handle chop, right?

3141
02:24:45,052 --> 02:24:46,469
I mean, it's a 170-foot yacht.

3142
02:24:46,553 --> 02:24:49,305
No, no, no. We're not going anywhere
unless he says it's safe, all right.

3143
02:24:49,389 --> 02:24:50,806
- Don't worry about the chop.
- It's safe.

3144
02:24:50,891 --> 02:24:52,224
You don't know shit about chop.

3145
02:24:52,309 --> 02:24:54,518
Oh, really? And you do?
You're a fucking expert on that.

3146
02:24:54,603 --> 02:24:56,937
I'll chop your fucking credit card in half.
How about that?

3147
02:24:57,022 --> 02:24:58,898
Chop is fine. Trust me. Chop is fine.

3148
02:24:58,982 --> 02:25:00,691
Is chop fine, Captain Ted?

3149
02:25:02,027 --> 02:25:03,861
Yeah. I mean, if we take it slow.

3150
02:25:03,945 --> 02:25:05,112
Yeah, we're gonna take it slow.

3151
02:25:05,197 --> 02:25:06,781
It's a little uncomfortable.
Tell them it's safe.

3152
02:25:06,865 --> 02:25:08,032
It's gonna be safe.

3153
02:25:08,116 --> 02:25:11,702
We'll batten down the hatches
and secure the deck.

3154
02:25:11,787 --> 02:25:15,498
And we're looking at a few...
Maybe a few broken dishes.

3155
02:25:15,582 --> 02:25:16,707
Few broken dishes.

3156
02:25:16,792 --> 02:25:18,000
What's a few broken dishes?

3157
02:25:18,085 --> 02:25:19,377
Does that sound fucking awesome
or what?

3158
02:25:19,461 --> 02:25:20,836
No. Not really.

3159
02:25:20,921 --> 02:25:22,213
We're gonna have a fucking good time!

3160
02:25:22,297 --> 02:25:24,048
Let's go to fucking Monaco now!

3161
02:25:24,132 --> 02:25:25,299
Let's fucking move! Let's go!

3162
02:25:30,722 --> 02:25:31,764
Hold on!

3163
02:25:34,935 --> 02:25:37,937
What the fuck is going on out here?

3164
02:25:38,021 --> 02:25:40,648
The Jet Skis just went overboard!

3165
02:25:40,732 --> 02:25:42,733
Oh, Jesus Christ! Honey, you okay?

3166
02:25:42,818 --> 02:25:44,944
Gale warning! Gale warning!

3167
02:25:45,028 --> 02:25:47,822
The waves are
20 feet high and building!

3168
02:25:47,906 --> 02:25:49,573
Turn around, let's go
the other fucking way.

3169
02:25:49,658 --> 02:25:50,866
- We can't!
- Go!

3170
02:25:50,951 --> 02:25:53,536
We'll get broad-sided. It'll tip over!

3171
02:25:53,620 --> 02:25:55,413
I am a master diver. You hear that?

3172
02:25:55,497 --> 02:25:56,539
I'm a master diver!

3173
02:25:56,623 --> 02:25:57,873
No one's gonna fucking die!

3174
02:25:57,958 --> 02:26:00,584
I got you, baby. I got you.
Trust me, okay?

3175
02:26:00,669 --> 02:26:01,919
I love you.

3176
02:26:02,003 --> 02:26:03,921
I love you, baby. Just hold on tight.

3177
02:26:04,005 --> 02:26:05,047
Okay.

3178
02:26:05,132 --> 02:26:06,173
Donnie!

3179
02:26:07,759 --> 02:26:08,968
Hold on, baby!

3180
02:26:09,052 --> 02:26:13,139
Donnie!

3181
02:26:13,640 --> 02:26:15,015
- What?
- Hold on, baby.

3182
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:16,600
Get the fucking ludes.

3183
02:26:16,685 --> 02:26:17,852
I don't wanna die, Jordan!

3184
02:26:17,936 --> 02:26:20,646
I did a lot of bad shit.
I'm going to hell, Jordan!

3185
02:26:20,730 --> 02:26:23,607
I fucked up! I fucked up so bad!

3186
02:26:23,692 --> 02:26:25,693
Get the ludes! Downstairs!

3187
02:26:25,902 --> 02:26:27,111
What are you saying?

3188
02:26:27,612 --> 02:26:29,029
Fuck!

3189
02:26:29,906 --> 02:26:31,115
Get the ludes!

3190
02:26:31,199 --> 02:26:32,783
I can't go down there, Jordan.
It's flooded.

3191
02:26:32,868 --> 02:26:34,118
It's three feet of water down there!

3192
02:26:34,202 --> 02:26:36,954
I will not die sober!

3193
02:26:37,038 --> 02:26:38,789
Get those fucking ludes!

3194
02:26:38,874 --> 02:26:39,915
Okay!

3195
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,333
- Go!
- Okay.

3196
02:26:44,212 --> 02:26:45,963
- Where's he going?
- Hold on, baby!

3197
02:26:46,047 --> 02:26:47,631
Donnie! Is he fucking crazy?

3198
02:26:47,716 --> 02:26:48,841
He's just warning everybody!

3199
02:27:01,062 --> 02:27:02,771
Jesus Christ!

3200
02:27:04,357 --> 02:27:05,524
Hold on!

3201
02:27:05,609 --> 02:27:07,067
Get away from the window!

3202
02:27:07,152 --> 02:27:08,527
Rogue wave!

3203
02:27:08,612 --> 02:27:09,653
Mayday!

3204
02:27:09,738 --> 02:27:12,323
This is Captain Ted Beecham
aboard the yacht Naomi!

3205
02:27:12,407 --> 02:27:13,908
- We are going down!
- I got 'em!

3206
02:27:14,367 --> 02:27:15,576
I got 'em!

3207
02:27:16,745 --> 02:27:18,287
Give me one for the nerves!

3208
02:27:18,371 --> 02:27:19,497
We're going down!

3209
02:27:19,581 --> 02:27:21,790
This is a fucking Mayday!

3210
02:27:21,875 --> 02:27:23,959
We require immediate assistance!

3211
02:27:26,213 --> 02:27:27,213
Hold on!

3212
02:27:27,297 --> 02:27:28,506
Watch out!

3213
02:27:40,185 --> 02:27:42,728
The nice thing about
getting rescued by Italians

3214
02:27:43,021 --> 02:27:46,565
is that they feed you,
make you drink red wine,

3215
02:27:46,650 --> 02:27:48,609
then you get to dance.

3216
02:28:05,210 --> 02:28:06,877
Did you see that?

3217
02:28:07,295 --> 02:28:10,214
That was the plane
I sent to come get us.

3218
02:28:11,132 --> 02:28:14,885
I shit you not, it exploded
when a seagull flew into the engine.

3219
02:28:14,970 --> 02:28:16,971
Three people killed.

3220
02:28:21,142 --> 02:28:22,977
You want a sign from God?

3221
02:28:23,061 --> 02:28:26,146
Well, after all this,
I finally got the message.

3222
02:28:31,611 --> 02:28:35,239
Do you dream of becoming
financially independent

3223
02:28:35,323 --> 02:28:37,992
but struggle every month
just to pay your bills?

3224
02:28:38,076 --> 02:28:42,162
Would you like to own a home like this,
but can barely afford to pay your rent?

3225
02:28:42,247 --> 02:28:45,958
My name is Jordan Belfort,
and there's no secret to wealth creation.

3226
02:28:46,042 --> 02:28:48,544
No matter who you are,
no matter where you came from,

3227
02:28:48,628 --> 02:28:51,213
you too can become
financially independent

3228
02:28:51,298 --> 02:28:53,048
in just a matter of months.

3229
02:28:53,133 --> 02:28:55,259
All you need is a strategy.

3230
02:28:55,343 --> 02:28:56,969
When I was 24 years old,

3231
02:28:57,053 --> 02:29:00,889
I made a decision
not just to survive, but to thrive.

3232
02:29:00,974 --> 02:29:03,434
At first I didn't feel like
deals like these were possible.

3233
02:29:03,518 --> 02:29:06,937
But we have the house
and we have a $33,000 profit.

3234
02:29:07,022 --> 02:29:08,147
I certainly believe now.

3235
02:29:08,231 --> 02:29:09,648
Think about it for a second.

3236
02:29:09,733 --> 02:29:11,859
If you don't have the guts
to attend Jordan Belfort's

3237
02:29:11,943 --> 02:29:14,111
Straight Line Persuasion
System seminar,

3238
02:29:14,195 --> 02:29:15,779
then how do you expect
to make any money?

3239
02:29:15,864 --> 02:29:19,617
If you want to be a millionaire someday,
have some guts. Make a decision.

3240
02:29:19,701 --> 02:29:22,453
Jordan Belfort's setup worked for me
because I worked hard for it.

3241
02:29:22,537 --> 02:29:25,080
And if it doesn't work for you,
it's because you're lazy.

3242
02:29:25,165 --> 02:29:26,790
And you should get a job at McDonald's.

3243
02:29:26,875 --> 02:29:29,293
There's nobody holding you back
from financial freedom.

3244
02:29:29,377 --> 02:29:32,296
And there's nobody stopping you
from making millions.

3245
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:33,631
Don't just sit at home,

3246
02:29:33,715 --> 02:29:36,342
or the life of your dreams
will sail right past you.

3247
02:29:39,095 --> 02:29:42,723
I changed all these people's lives
and I can change yours, too!

3248
02:29:42,807 --> 02:29:44,058
So come to my seminar!

3249
02:29:44,142 --> 02:29:45,517
The life of your dreams is only...

3250
02:29:45,602 --> 02:29:47,311
Good to see you again, Jordan.

3251
02:29:47,395 --> 02:29:48,479
You're under arrest!

3252
02:29:48,563 --> 02:29:50,147
You gotta be joking!

3253
02:29:51,399 --> 02:29:52,650
You're kidding me.

3254
02:29:52,734 --> 02:29:54,318
Hey, get the fuck away from me!

3255
02:29:54,402 --> 02:29:55,653
Turn that camera off.

3256
02:29:55,737 --> 02:29:57,738
I'm fucking shooting
a fucking infomercial here,

3257
02:29:57,822 --> 02:29:59,198
you fucking cocksucker!

3258
02:29:59,282 --> 02:30:00,991
- Fuck you, you motherfucker!
- Shut the fucking camera off.

3259
02:30:01,076 --> 02:30:02,826
You don't got shit on me, you hear me!

3260
02:30:02,911 --> 02:30:03,994
Go fuck yourself!

3261
02:30:04,079 --> 02:30:06,455
I'm making an honest living,
you fucking piece of shit!

3262
02:30:06,539 --> 02:30:09,500
Hey, Jordan,
let me give you a little legal advice.

3263
02:30:09,584 --> 02:30:11,001
Shut the fuck up!

3264
02:30:11,086 --> 02:30:12,628
Oh, fuck you, you fucking prick!

3265
02:30:12,712 --> 02:30:15,255
I'm making an honest living,
you motherfucker!

3266
02:30:17,092 --> 02:30:18,509
I clean up my act.

3267
02:30:18,593 --> 02:30:21,178
I did rehab. I'm a TV personality.

3268
02:30:21,262 --> 02:30:24,014
I'm sober for two years.
And this happens!

3269
02:30:24,099 --> 02:30:26,308
Rugrat goes
and gets busted down in Miami.

3270
02:30:26,393 --> 02:30:27,643
I'm Swiss, I'm not communist.

3271
02:30:27,727 --> 02:30:29,395
And guess who the fuck with? Saurel.

3272
02:30:29,479 --> 02:30:30,521
- You gonna beat me?
- No, sir.

3273
02:30:30,605 --> 02:30:32,856
Yeah, I know your country.
You're gonna beat me.

3274
02:30:32,941 --> 02:30:34,692
I mean, what are the fucking odds?

3275
02:30:34,776 --> 02:30:37,403
There had to be 10,000
Swiss bankers in Geneva,

3276
02:30:37,487 --> 02:30:41,281
and Rugrat gets the one dumb enough
to get himself arrested on U.S. soil.

3277
02:30:41,366 --> 02:30:42,741
I know.

3278
02:30:42,867 --> 02:30:44,243
I'm so sorry.

3279
02:30:46,454 --> 02:30:47,663
Even more fucked

3280
02:30:47,747 --> 02:30:50,874
was that he got busted
for shit that had nothing to do with me.

3281
02:30:50,959 --> 02:30:52,543
It had nothing to fucking do with me.

3282
02:30:52,627 --> 02:30:54,586
Something about laundering drug money

3283
02:30:54,671 --> 02:30:57,756
through offshore boat racing
and a guy named Rocky Aoki,

3284
02:30:57,841 --> 02:30:59,967
you know, the founder of Benihana.

3285
02:31:00,051 --> 02:31:01,385
Benihana.

3286
02:31:01,469 --> 02:31:05,347
Beni-fucking-hana!

3287
02:31:05,432 --> 02:31:06,390
Why?

3288
02:31:06,474 --> 02:31:07,850
Why, why, God?

3289
02:31:07,934 --> 02:31:09,393
Why would you be so cruel

3290
02:31:09,477 --> 02:31:12,062
as to choose
a chain of fucking hibachi restaurants

3291
02:31:12,147 --> 02:31:13,397
to take me down?

3292
02:31:15,817 --> 02:31:18,277
Long story short. Saurel rats me out.

3293
02:31:18,361 --> 02:31:21,488
But not before he rats out
Brad's wife, Chantalle,

3294
02:31:21,573 --> 02:31:25,659
who, it turns out, he'd been fucking
every time she went to Switzerland!

3295
02:31:27,662 --> 02:31:30,164
- No, no, no, it's impossible.
- Oui, oui, oui.

3296
02:31:32,375 --> 02:31:34,168
All right!

3297
02:31:34,252 --> 02:31:37,755
One count engaging in conspiracy
to commit securities fraud.

3298
02:31:37,839 --> 02:31:40,048
Two counts securities fraud.

3299
02:31:40,133 --> 02:31:43,594
One count engaging in conspiracy
to commit money laundering.

3300
02:31:43,678 --> 02:31:45,929
Twenty-one counts money laundering.

3301
02:31:46,014 --> 02:31:48,390
One count obstruction of justice.

3302
02:31:49,434 --> 02:31:51,643
Bail is set at $10 million.

3303
02:32:06,868 --> 02:32:08,452
Uncle Donnie's here!

3304
02:32:09,245 --> 02:32:11,497
Rocky. How you doing?

3305
02:32:12,791 --> 02:32:14,458
I hate that fucking dog.

3306
02:32:14,542 --> 02:32:16,877
Yeah, he's getting old and decrepit.

3307
02:32:16,961 --> 02:32:18,462
Starting to shit in the house again.

3308
02:32:18,546 --> 02:32:20,255
- Me, too.
- Come here, buddy.

3309
02:32:20,340 --> 02:32:21,632
Ah, fuck.

3310
02:32:21,716 --> 02:32:23,342
- It's good to see you, pal.
- Yeah, you, too.

3311
02:32:23,426 --> 02:32:24,635
Good to see you.

3312
02:32:24,719 --> 02:32:27,221
Sit down. Oh, man.

3313
02:32:29,098 --> 02:32:30,390
How you doing, brother?

3314
02:32:31,226 --> 02:32:32,726
You know.

3315
02:32:32,811 --> 02:32:34,478
Shitty, pal.

3316
02:32:34,562 --> 02:32:36,688
But I'm hanging in there.

3317
02:32:38,024 --> 02:32:40,526
My new piece of jewelry. Check that out.

3318
02:32:40,610 --> 02:32:42,986
Can't leave the house, you know?

3319
02:32:43,071 --> 02:32:45,656
Starting to get cabin fever already.

3320
02:32:46,241 --> 02:32:47,783
Fucking Rugrat.

3321
02:32:48,368 --> 02:32:49,660
That wig-wearing faggot.

3322
02:32:49,744 --> 02:32:51,870
I can't believe that fucking guy.
I wanna kill him.

3323
02:32:51,955 --> 02:32:54,540
Swear to God,
I want to choke him to death.

3324
02:32:54,624 --> 02:32:56,917
Irresponsible little prick.

3325
02:32:57,043 --> 02:32:58,085
I'll tell you one thing.

3326
02:33:00,463 --> 02:33:02,965
I'm never eating at Benihana again.

3327
02:33:03,842 --> 02:33:06,009
I don't care whose birthday it is.

3328
02:33:07,428 --> 02:33:08,971
Where's Naomi? How's she doing?

3329
02:33:09,764 --> 02:33:11,056
That's her in the house there.

3330
02:33:11,140 --> 02:33:13,100
You could say hi,
but she probably won't wave back.

3331
02:33:13,351 --> 02:33:14,977
Naomi, sweetheart!

3332
02:33:18,439 --> 02:33:19,690
What's up her ass?

3333
02:33:19,774 --> 02:33:21,316
- Is she mad at me?
- No, you know...

3334
02:33:21,401 --> 02:33:22,860
We probably have
to mortgage the house

3335
02:33:22,944 --> 02:33:24,736
in order to make bail.

3336
02:33:24,821 --> 02:33:28,532
Probably end up selling the thing
in order to pay for all the lawyers.

3337
02:33:28,616 --> 02:33:31,076
It's been a nightmare, buddy,
to tell you the truth.

3338
02:33:31,327 --> 02:33:33,036
What are you gonna do, right?

3339
02:33:33,830 --> 02:33:36,665
Anyway, how's Stratton?
That's more important.

3340
02:33:36,749 --> 02:33:37,833
How's morale?

3341
02:33:37,917 --> 02:33:40,544
They all pissed off 'cause they have
to make money legally now?

3342
02:33:40,628 --> 02:33:42,087
Jordan.

3343
02:33:42,463 --> 02:33:44,882
I got the founding partners together.

3344
02:33:44,966 --> 02:33:47,384
I talked to them about everything.

3345
02:33:48,136 --> 02:33:49,136
And I got you.

3346
02:33:49,971 --> 02:33:51,555
What do you mean, you got me?

3347
02:33:52,724 --> 02:33:55,475
The house, money,
don't worry about it. I got you.

3348
02:34:01,482 --> 02:34:02,566
All right.

3349
02:34:02,650 --> 02:34:03,609
I love you, buddy.

3350
02:34:03,693 --> 02:34:05,611
- You know I'd do it for you, right?
- I know.

3351
02:34:05,695 --> 02:34:07,654
- You know that, right?
- I know.

3352
02:34:08,656 --> 02:34:09,781
I could fucking kiss you all over.

3353
02:34:09,866 --> 02:34:11,033
All right, enough, enough.

3354
02:34:13,119 --> 02:34:14,244
You want a beer, pal?

3355
02:34:14,329 --> 02:34:15,579
What are you drinking?

3356
02:34:15,663 --> 02:34:17,748
I got this non-alcoholic shit.

3357
02:34:17,832 --> 02:34:19,041
What's that?

3358
02:34:19,125 --> 02:34:22,127
A non-alcoholic beer. It's got no alcohol.

3359
02:34:22,211 --> 02:34:24,504
- It's a beer?
- Yeah, with no alcohol.

3360
02:34:25,048 --> 02:34:26,298
But if you drink enough,

3361
02:34:26,382 --> 02:34:28,300
if you drink a lot,
they get you fucked up?

3362
02:34:28,384 --> 02:34:30,469
No, there's no alcohol.
That's the fucking point.

3363
02:34:30,553 --> 02:34:31,595
I'm not a scientist.

3364
02:34:31,679 --> 02:34:32,846
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

3365
02:34:32,931 --> 02:34:34,514
I can get you a beer
if you want a fucking beer.

3366
02:34:34,641 --> 02:34:36,767
I know, but I don't drink. You remember?

3367
02:34:36,851 --> 02:34:38,060
I don't drink anymore.

3368
02:34:38,144 --> 02:34:40,604
Oh, you wanna go inside
and blow some lines of baking powder?

3369
02:34:40,688 --> 02:34:41,855
Or baking soda...

3370
02:34:42,649 --> 02:34:44,942
Can't imagine ever not enjoying
getting fucked up.

3371
02:34:45,026 --> 02:34:46,443
- Yeah.
- I love it.

3372
02:34:46,527 --> 02:34:48,070
How's being sober?

3373
02:34:48,154 --> 02:34:49,988
- Fucking sucks.
- Boring, right?

3374
02:34:50,073 --> 02:34:52,491
So boring. I wanna kill myself.

3375
02:34:53,034 --> 02:34:55,577
There's a term,
and we don't like to use it

3376
02:34:55,662 --> 02:34:57,120
unless circumstances dictate,

3377
02:34:57,205 --> 02:34:59,164
and I think they do dictate in this case,

3378
02:34:59,248 --> 02:35:00,666
and the term is "Grenada."

3379
02:35:00,750 --> 02:35:02,292
Have you ever heard of Grenada?

3380
02:35:02,377 --> 02:35:03,418
No. No, I haven't.

3381
02:35:03,544 --> 02:35:07,047
Grenada's very interesting because
it is a small island nation

3382
02:35:07,131 --> 02:35:10,676
that was invaded by
the United States of America in 1983.

3383
02:35:10,760 --> 02:35:12,844
It's about 90,000 people.

3384
02:35:12,929 --> 02:35:15,180
And essentially, it means

3385
02:35:15,932 --> 02:35:17,933
this case is unloseable.

3386
02:35:18,017 --> 02:35:19,101
Okay?

3387
02:35:19,185 --> 02:35:20,769
So, you know, we can come in,

3388
02:35:20,853 --> 02:35:22,688
we can have our dick
hanging out of our pants.

3389
02:35:22,772 --> 02:35:23,939
Nobody gives a fuck.

3390
02:35:24,023 --> 02:35:25,565
I'm gonna win.

3391
02:35:25,733 --> 02:35:27,109
You, sir,

3392
02:35:28,653 --> 02:35:30,404
are what's known

3393
02:35:31,406 --> 02:35:32,614
as a Grenada.

3394
02:35:35,743 --> 02:35:38,078
You're looking at real prison time.

3395
02:35:39,247 --> 02:35:41,581
Money laundering
can get you as much as 20 years.

3396
02:35:42,583 --> 02:35:45,252
And our case couldn't be stronger
if we caught you

3397
02:35:45,336 --> 02:35:47,004
shoving cash in your mattress.

3398
02:35:47,088 --> 02:35:48,130
Is that right?

3399
02:35:49,007 --> 02:35:51,425
Hey, Jordan. Jordan.

3400
02:35:52,135 --> 02:35:55,971
Your rotting away in jail
till your kids get out of college,

3401
02:35:56,055 --> 02:35:57,681
that's not our ambition here.

3402
02:35:59,100 --> 02:36:01,643
There's other people
involved in this, too.

3403
02:36:01,728 --> 02:36:04,855
We think they need
to see their day in court as well.

3404
02:36:07,442 --> 02:36:09,484
Why do I sense
there's an offer in the air?

3405
02:36:09,569 --> 02:36:12,237
Look at him. He's got a sense.
What are you, Kreskin?

3406
02:36:13,448 --> 02:36:16,199
Full cooperation. He provides us
with a comprehensive list

3407
02:36:16,284 --> 02:36:18,660
of all the co-conspirators
spanning the last seven years,

3408
02:36:18,745 --> 02:36:20,704
and he also agrees to wear a wire.

3409
02:36:20,788 --> 02:36:22,039
Wait...

3410
02:36:22,123 --> 02:36:23,874
Did you just say "wear a wire"?

3411
02:36:23,958 --> 02:36:25,208
A wire.

3412
02:36:25,293 --> 02:36:26,668
What does that mean?

3413
02:36:26,753 --> 02:36:28,587
You want me to rat? Is that it?

3414
02:36:28,671 --> 02:36:29,963
No, I want you to cooperate.

3415
02:36:30,048 --> 02:36:31,965
- No. You want me to rat, right?
- Yes. We want you to rat.

3416
02:36:32,050 --> 02:36:35,886
That's fucking exactly
what we want you to do. To rat.

3417
02:36:39,974 --> 02:36:41,808
How was Cristy's party?

3418
02:36:41,893 --> 02:36:42,976
Fine.

3419
02:36:43,061 --> 02:36:44,436
Good.

3420
02:36:45,605 --> 02:36:48,065
Babe, I spoke
to the lawyers again today.

3421
02:36:48,149 --> 02:36:50,817
I have some really, really great news.

3422
02:36:52,653 --> 02:36:55,197
Turns out you're completely
off the hook, honey.

3423
02:36:56,157 --> 02:36:57,824
I know that already.

3424
02:36:57,909 --> 02:36:59,409
Right. Exactly.

3425
02:36:59,494 --> 02:37:02,704
You never did anything wrong
in the first place, right?

3426
02:37:03,664 --> 02:37:05,874
It turns out, all the FBI really

3427
02:37:06,542 --> 02:37:10,212
wants from me is to cooperate.

3428
02:37:10,463 --> 02:37:11,671
You know?

3429
02:37:11,756 --> 02:37:14,758
Turns out I have so much information
about the stock market and Wall Street,

3430
02:37:14,842 --> 02:37:16,635
I could save the government
years of heartache,

3431
02:37:16,719 --> 02:37:19,346
not to mention countless dollars.

3432
02:37:20,848 --> 02:37:23,183
But it gets even better, babe.

3433
02:37:23,643 --> 02:37:26,186
Because if I do decide to cooperate,

3434
02:37:26,562 --> 02:37:29,397
I might only be looking
at four short years,

3435
02:37:29,482 --> 02:37:30,941
in which case, you know,

3436
02:37:31,025 --> 02:37:34,069
we could start fresh,
maybe sell the house.

3437
02:37:34,153 --> 02:37:35,779
And any fines that I'd have to pay

3438
02:37:35,863 --> 02:37:37,656
wouldn't be due
till after I serve my term,

3439
02:37:37,740 --> 02:37:40,033
so we'd still have plenty
of money left over, you know?

3440
02:37:42,703 --> 02:37:45,122
The only thing that
of course bummed me out a little bit

3441
02:37:45,206 --> 02:37:50,252
is this whole idea of having to
give information about my friends.

3442
02:37:50,336 --> 02:37:53,547
Like you said, "There's no friends
on Wall Street." Right?

3443
02:37:53,631 --> 02:37:55,590
Right. Right. Exactly.

3444
02:37:55,675 --> 02:37:57,259
There's a silver lining
to that, too, honey.

3445
02:37:57,343 --> 02:37:59,010
Because they said eventually...

3446
02:37:59,095 --> 02:38:01,972
Eventually everyone's gonna have
to give information on this case.

3447
02:38:02,056 --> 02:38:04,850
So, at the end of the day, it might
not even be a factor. You know?

3448
02:38:04,934 --> 02:38:07,060
Well, that's good news. Right?

3449
02:38:07,186 --> 02:38:08,895
Yeah, yeah.

3450
02:38:08,980 --> 02:38:10,689
I'm really happy for you.

3451
02:38:12,066 --> 02:38:15,318
What do you mean,
happy for me, sweetheart?

3452
02:38:16,237 --> 02:38:18,822
You should be happy for
the both of us. Right?

3453
02:38:18,906 --> 02:38:20,866
- Yeah, right.
- All right.

3454
02:38:22,952 --> 02:38:24,578
Come here, baby.

3455
02:38:25,079 --> 02:38:26,621
Give me a kiss, sweetheart.

3456
02:38:26,706 --> 02:38:27,706
Jordan...

3457
02:38:27,790 --> 02:38:28,999
Oh, come on, baby.

3458
02:38:29,083 --> 02:38:31,293
I haven't made love to you
in so long. Please.

3459
02:38:31,377 --> 02:38:33,795
- No. Jordan, stop it.
- Come on, honey, please.

3460
02:38:33,880 --> 02:38:35,297
No! Jordan, stop it!

3461
02:38:37,049 --> 02:38:39,259
I've loved you
since the moment I saw you.

3462
02:38:43,139 --> 02:38:45,015
I fucking hate you, Jordan.

3463
02:38:45,600 --> 02:38:48,143
- Get off me!
- Baby... Don't do that.

3464
02:38:49,020 --> 02:38:50,937
You know how much I love you, right?

3465
02:38:51,439 --> 02:38:53,607
Stop that, sweetie. Please.

3466
02:38:58,863 --> 02:39:00,906
You wanna fuck me, Jordan?

3467
02:39:02,658 --> 02:39:04,367
You wanna fuck me?

3468
02:39:05,369 --> 02:39:06,494
Good.

3469
02:39:06,579 --> 02:39:07,913
Go ahead.

3470
02:39:08,414 --> 02:39:10,332
Go ahead and fuck me.

3471
02:39:11,417 --> 02:39:13,835
I want you to fuck me real hard.

3472
02:39:13,961 --> 02:39:16,630
I want you to fuck me like
it's the last fucking time.

3473
02:39:16,714 --> 02:39:18,048
- Why are you moving like that?
- Come on.

3474
02:39:18,132 --> 02:39:19,090
Please hold still.

3475
02:39:19,175 --> 02:39:20,717
'Cause I want you to come for me, baby.

3476
02:39:20,801 --> 02:39:22,135
Come on, babe.

3477
02:39:22,220 --> 02:39:23,720
Come for me, baby.

3478
02:39:23,804 --> 02:39:25,013
I want you to come for me

3479
02:39:25,097 --> 02:39:26,556
like it's the last fucking time.

3480
02:39:26,641 --> 02:39:28,099
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

3481
02:39:28,184 --> 02:39:30,769
Come on, baby. Come for me.
Come for me, baby.

3482
02:39:30,853 --> 02:39:31,978
Come on, baby.

3483
02:39:32,063 --> 02:39:33,396
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

3484
02:39:33,481 --> 02:39:35,398
- Yeah, baby, come.
- You want me to come for you?

3485
02:39:35,483 --> 02:39:36,650
Yeah.

3486
02:39:37,485 --> 02:39:39,444
- You want me to come for you?
- Yeah!

3487
02:39:39,528 --> 02:39:41,863
Huh? You want me to come for you?

3488
02:39:43,699 --> 02:39:45,408
Oh, God, baby. Yeah!

3489
02:39:45,493 --> 02:39:47,994
Oh, God. Oh, God.

3490
02:39:49,330 --> 02:39:53,750
Oh, God.

3491
02:39:53,834 --> 02:39:55,085
Jesus.

3492
02:39:58,714 --> 02:40:00,048
Oh, baby.

3493
02:40:00,132 --> 02:40:02,634
That was so fucking great!

3494
02:40:02,718 --> 02:40:04,010
Oh, God!

3495
02:40:06,347 --> 02:40:08,306
That was the last time.

3496
02:40:08,808 --> 02:40:10,767
What do you mean, baby?

3497
02:40:10,851 --> 02:40:13,812
I mean that was the last time
we ever have sex.

3498
02:40:14,814 --> 02:40:16,856
What are you talking about?

3499
02:40:18,859 --> 02:40:20,527
I want a divorce.

3500
02:40:22,113 --> 02:40:24,114
What do you mean, you want a divorce?

3501
02:40:24,198 --> 02:40:26,241
What's that supposed to mean,
you want a divorce?

3502
02:40:26,325 --> 02:40:28,201
Get off me! I want a divorce.

3503
02:40:28,536 --> 02:40:29,786
You just made love to me.

3504
02:40:29,870 --> 02:40:30,954
What the fuck is wrong with you?

3505
02:40:31,038 --> 02:40:33,373
I don't love you anymore, Jordan!

3506
02:40:34,667 --> 02:40:36,626
Oh, you don't love me?

3507
02:40:37,044 --> 02:40:38,628
You don't love me anymore, huh?

3508
02:40:38,713 --> 02:40:40,964
Well, isn't that just fucking
convenient for you!

3509
02:40:41,048 --> 02:40:42,882
Now that I'm under federal indictment,

3510
02:40:42,967 --> 02:40:44,926
with an electronic bracelet
around my ankle,

3511
02:40:45,011 --> 02:40:46,720
now you decide you don't
fucking love me anymore.

3512
02:40:46,804 --> 02:40:48,555
- Is that right?
- No, no.

3513
02:40:48,889 --> 02:40:51,141
What kind of person are you? Tell me.

3514
02:40:51,225 --> 02:40:52,475
You married me!

3515
02:40:52,560 --> 02:40:54,060
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

3516
02:40:54,145 --> 02:40:55,812
Jordan, this is how it's gonna go.

3517
02:40:55,896 --> 02:40:58,064
I'm gonna take custody of the kids.

3518
02:40:58,149 --> 02:41:01,693
If you agree to the divorce right now,
I will allow visitation.

3519
02:41:01,819 --> 02:41:03,653
- Okay? Don't try to fight it.
- Oh, my God.

3520
02:41:03,738 --> 02:41:07,907
It'll save us both a lot of money
and I got a feeling you're gonna need it.

3521
02:41:09,452 --> 02:41:12,662
You're not taking my kids, sweetheart.
You hear me?

3522
02:41:12,747 --> 02:41:14,164
I've already talked to the lawyer.

3523
02:41:14,248 --> 02:41:15,498
He said even if you don't get convicted,

3524
02:41:15,583 --> 02:41:16,666
I've got a good chance of getting them.

3525
02:41:16,751 --> 02:41:17,834
I got news for you.

3526
02:41:17,918 --> 02:41:21,338
You're not fucking taking my children,
you vicious fucking cunt, you!

3527
02:41:21,881 --> 02:41:23,840
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!

3528
02:41:23,924 --> 02:41:26,092
You're not fucking taking
my goddamn fucking kids!

3529
02:41:26,177 --> 02:41:27,552
You hear me? Fuck you!

3530
02:41:27,762 --> 02:41:30,513
You're not fucking
taking my fucking kids!

3531
02:41:39,106 --> 02:41:40,899
Fucking bitch!

3532
02:41:43,361 --> 02:41:44,736
Fucking whore!

3533
02:41:49,116 --> 02:41:51,785
Fucking bitch!
Piece of shit fucking whore!

3534
02:42:00,961 --> 02:42:03,713
Look at yourself, Jordan.

3535
02:42:03,798 --> 02:42:04,964
You're sick!

3536
02:42:05,049 --> 02:42:06,216
You're a sick man!

3537
02:42:06,300 --> 02:42:08,343
Fuck you! I told you,
you're not taking my fucking kids!

3538
02:42:08,427 --> 02:42:10,887
You think I would let my kids near you?

3539
02:42:10,971 --> 02:42:12,138
Look at yourself!

3540
02:42:12,223 --> 02:42:13,723
You know what my lawyer said?

3541
02:42:13,808 --> 02:42:17,268
My lawyer said that you're going
to prison for 20 years, Jordan.

3542
02:42:17,353 --> 02:42:20,605
Twenty fucking years!
You're never gonna see the kids again!

3543
02:42:20,689 --> 02:42:21,898
You don't think I'm not gonna see my...

3544
02:42:21,982 --> 02:42:23,733
No, I'm not fucking
letting you near my kids!

3545
02:42:23,818 --> 02:42:25,985
You don't think I'm gonna see
my fucking kids again, huh?

3546
02:42:26,070 --> 02:42:27,612
Don't you fucking touch them!

3547
02:42:28,948 --> 02:42:30,740
Don't you fucking touch me!

3548
02:42:32,451 --> 02:42:35,703
Sweetheart? You're coming
on a trip with Daddy, all right?

3549
02:42:35,788 --> 02:42:37,747
You're coming on a trip with Daddy.

3550
02:42:40,501 --> 02:42:42,752
Don't you fucking touch her, Jordan.

3551
02:42:42,837 --> 02:42:45,588
I swear to God, I will fucking kill you!

3552
02:42:48,259 --> 02:42:49,509
It's all right, baby.

3553
02:42:49,593 --> 02:42:52,303
You and Daddy are gonna go
on a little trip together, okay?

3554
02:42:52,388 --> 02:42:53,930
- A little trip together.
- Violet!

3555
02:42:54,014 --> 02:42:55,098
Violet!

3556
02:42:55,182 --> 02:42:57,392
- Get the key! Get the key!
- I got it!

3557
02:42:57,476 --> 02:42:59,102
Jordan, you open this fucking door

3558
02:42:59,186 --> 02:43:01,980
- right now! Open the door!
- Put your seat belt on.

3559
02:43:02,064 --> 02:43:03,398
There you go. Get your legs in.

3560
02:43:03,482 --> 02:43:05,108
I'm taking her with me!

3561
02:43:05,192 --> 02:43:07,819
I told you I'm taking her with me,
you fucking bitch!

3562
02:43:07,903 --> 02:43:10,613
You're not gonna stop me!
You're not gonna stop me!

3563
02:43:11,407 --> 02:43:13,491
We're going on a little trip, honey.

3564
02:43:13,909 --> 02:43:15,410
No! No!

3565
02:43:16,036 --> 02:43:17,412
Get the hell out of here!

3566
02:43:17,496 --> 02:43:19,622
Leave that baby alone!

3567
02:43:19,707 --> 02:43:21,875
Violet! Garage door! Close it!

3568
02:43:21,959 --> 02:43:23,084
Mommy!

3569
02:43:23,210 --> 02:43:25,378
- Get out of here!
- Open the fucking door!

3570
02:43:26,297 --> 02:43:27,422
Mommy!

3571
02:43:30,468 --> 02:43:32,093
No!

3572
02:43:39,393 --> 02:43:42,145
Oh, Lord! Oh, my heavens...

3573
02:43:42,229 --> 02:43:43,521
Get the baby!

3574
02:43:43,606 --> 02:43:45,732
Naomi, get the baby!

3575
02:43:46,484 --> 02:43:48,151
- Mommy.
- Honey, it's okay.

3576
02:43:48,235 --> 02:43:49,486
It's gonna be okay.

3577
02:43:49,570 --> 02:43:51,571
Oh, Mr. Jordan has lost his mind.

3578
02:43:52,573 --> 02:43:54,365
- Baby...
- It's all right, honey.

3579
02:43:54,450 --> 02:43:56,034
She all right?

3580
02:43:56,118 --> 02:43:57,410
Is she all right?

3581
02:43:58,162 --> 02:43:59,746
What's the matter with you?

3582
02:43:59,997 --> 02:44:01,331
Is she all right?

3583
02:44:08,714 --> 02:44:10,089
Paragraph one.

3584
02:44:10,174 --> 02:44:11,674
The defendant shall plead guilty

3585
02:44:11,759 --> 02:44:15,178
to all counts of the indictment
currently pending against him

3586
02:44:15,262 --> 02:44:19,098
in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of New York.

3587
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:20,683
Paragraph two.

3588
02:44:20,768 --> 02:44:21,893
Talk normally.

3589
02:44:21,977 --> 02:44:25,188
The defendant shall participate
in undercover activities...

3590
02:44:25,272 --> 02:44:26,397
Breathe normally.

3591
02:44:26,482 --> 02:44:30,026
...including wearing a recording device,
also known as a wire...

3592
02:44:30,110 --> 02:44:32,278
After five minutes,
you'll forget you even have it on.

3593
02:44:32,363 --> 02:44:33,488
...in conjunction with the investigation...

3594
02:44:33,572 --> 02:44:35,114
Fucking brutal.

3595
02:44:35,241 --> 02:44:36,491
Quit your bitching.

3596
02:44:36,575 --> 02:44:38,409
Paragraph four.
The defendant must not commit,

3597
02:44:38,494 --> 02:44:40,662
or attempt to commit,
any further crimes.

3598
02:44:40,746 --> 02:44:44,207
Please. Let me just sign
the fucking thing already.

3599
02:44:44,291 --> 02:44:45,667
Thank you.

3600
02:44:48,629 --> 02:44:49,796
Just here?

3601
02:44:49,880 --> 02:44:51,422
That'd be good.

3602
02:44:53,133 --> 02:44:54,259
Thank you.

3603
02:44:54,343 --> 02:44:55,969
It wasn't even a choice.

3604
02:44:57,012 --> 02:45:00,014
For the next six hours,
I came up with a list.

3605
02:45:00,307 --> 02:45:03,226
Friends, enemies, business associates.

3606
02:45:03,310 --> 02:45:07,397
Anybody who'd ever known me
or taken so much as a stock tip.

3607
02:45:12,945 --> 02:45:15,238
Wolfie! Wolfie! Wolfie!

3608
02:45:17,032 --> 02:45:19,826
The first name on the list was Donnie.

3609
02:45:22,204 --> 02:45:25,331
Jordan, do you know how good it is
to have you back in this office?

3610
02:45:25,708 --> 02:45:27,750
It's not the same when you're gone.

3611
02:45:27,835 --> 02:45:29,586
It's sad, you understand? It's like...

3612
02:45:29,670 --> 02:45:31,087
That fucking Steve Madden, huh?

3613
02:45:31,171 --> 02:45:32,338
I can't...

3614
02:45:32,423 --> 02:45:34,257
Swear to God, I can't even think about it.

3615
02:45:34,341 --> 02:45:36,217
Every time I think about him,
my blood boils.

3616
02:45:36,302 --> 02:45:37,969
I can't even say his name.

3617
02:45:38,053 --> 02:45:39,596
- I know.
- It's, like, disgusting.

3618
02:45:39,680 --> 02:45:42,056
I grew up with this guy
and he betrays me like that.

3619
02:45:43,350 --> 02:45:46,269
He ever get back to you about that...

3620
02:45:47,021 --> 02:45:48,771
About that account?

3621
02:45:54,612 --> 02:45:55,653
You remember.

3622
02:45:55,738 --> 02:45:57,739
It was like four or five mil,
something like that, right?

3623
02:45:57,823 --> 02:46:00,950
He was supposed
to kick back four or five mil, was it?

3624
02:46:05,372 --> 02:46:06,831
Actually, I was...

3625
02:46:06,915 --> 02:46:08,291
I was fucked up, Jordan,

3626
02:46:08,375 --> 02:46:09,876
- so I don't really remember.
- Yeah.

3627
02:46:09,960 --> 02:46:11,961
Yeah, right. Stupid.

3628
02:46:12,630 --> 02:46:16,633
Well, if he calls you,
you make sure and contact me, okay?

3629
02:46:18,469 --> 02:46:20,136
- Yeah. Of course.
- Yeah.

3630
02:46:20,220 --> 02:46:22,305
Of course, yeah. No, of course.

3631
02:46:25,726 --> 02:46:28,227
You gonna eat
that last piece of yellowtail, bud?

3632
02:46:29,271 --> 02:46:31,022
No, it's all yours.

3633
02:46:31,857 --> 02:46:33,191
Can I get this?

3634
02:46:35,694 --> 02:46:37,403
So, what else is...

3635
02:46:40,157 --> 02:46:42,158
Well, how's Naomi and everything?

3636
02:46:42,242 --> 02:46:43,660
You know how it is.

3637
02:46:43,744 --> 02:46:45,828
She hates my fucking guts.

3638
02:46:47,581 --> 02:46:49,248
How's Hildy? Good?

3639
02:46:50,084 --> 02:46:53,670
She's still alive,
so my life is fucked, you know?

3640
02:46:53,754 --> 02:46:54,921
Yeah.

3641
02:47:01,762 --> 02:47:03,262
Mr. Jordan.

3642
02:47:04,932 --> 02:47:07,100
Mr. Jordan, you got a visitor.

3643
02:47:07,476 --> 02:47:08,518
What?

3644
02:47:08,977 --> 02:47:10,770
You've got a visitor.

3645
02:47:26,286 --> 02:47:28,287
I need you to get dressed.

3646
02:47:28,372 --> 02:47:30,581
Why? What the fuck's going on?

3647
02:47:35,629 --> 02:47:37,422
You're going to jail.

3648
02:47:49,351 --> 02:47:50,560
All right.

3649
02:47:50,644 --> 02:47:52,228
I'll get some clothes on.

3650
02:47:52,312 --> 02:47:54,647
We'll give you a hand with that.

3651
02:48:03,240 --> 02:48:04,323
Okay.

3652
02:48:16,545 --> 02:48:17,795
FBI!

3653
02:48:18,213 --> 02:48:21,799
Everybody sit down. Put your hands
where they can be seen, and shut up!

3654
02:48:21,884 --> 02:48:23,593
Don't you fucking touch me.

3655
02:48:23,677 --> 02:48:25,803
Get your fucking hands off me!

3656
02:48:25,888 --> 02:48:27,638
Don't get out of your seats!

3657
02:48:40,861 --> 02:48:42,487
It's fucking Chanel!

3658
02:48:55,125 --> 02:48:57,210
I gave up everyone.

3659
02:48:57,377 --> 02:48:58,878
And in return,

3660
02:48:58,962 --> 02:49:03,341
I got three years in some hellhole
in Nevada I'd never even heard of.

3661
02:49:05,219 --> 02:49:07,595
Like my pops, Mad Max, had said,

3662
02:49:08,388 --> 02:49:10,973
"The chickens had come home to roost."

3663
02:49:12,392 --> 02:49:14,602
Whatever the fuck that means.

3664
02:49:18,190 --> 02:49:19,482
I hope Your Honor would agree

3665
02:49:19,566 --> 02:49:21,567
that Mr. Belfort
has distinguished himself

3666
02:49:21,652 --> 02:49:23,736
in terms of his cooperation.

3667
02:49:23,821 --> 02:49:25,863
Mr. Belfort has helped
the government win convictions

3668
02:49:25,948 --> 02:49:28,491
of over two dozen serious offenders

3669
02:49:29,743 --> 02:49:31,661
and helped them
recover millions of dollars

3670
02:49:31,745 --> 02:49:35,164
to be made available
for restitution to their victims.

3671
02:49:37,417 --> 02:49:41,087
The sentence of the court shall be
36 months in federal prison.

3672
02:49:42,923 --> 02:49:45,049
Please remand the defendant.

3673
02:49:47,261 --> 02:49:48,970
I'm sorry.

3674
02:49:51,890 --> 02:49:52,932
That's okay.

3675
02:50:41,315 --> 02:50:43,733
I'm not ashamed to admit it.

3676
02:50:43,817 --> 02:50:45,651
When we arrived at the prison,

3677
02:50:45,736 --> 02:50:47,904
I was absolutely terrified.

3678
02:50:48,697 --> 02:50:50,072
Belfort, on your feet.

3679
02:50:50,157 --> 02:50:52,450
But I needn't have been.

3680
02:50:52,659 --> 02:50:55,286
You see, for a brief fleeting moment,

3681
02:50:55,996 --> 02:50:58,039
I'd forgotten I was rich.

3682
02:50:59,041 --> 02:51:02,501
And I lived in a place
where everything was for sale.

3683
02:51:05,005 --> 02:51:07,715
Wouldn't you like to learn how to sell it?

3684
02:51:07,799 --> 02:51:10,676
So listen. I've met some
bad motherfuckers in my life.

3685
02:51:10,761 --> 02:51:14,221
I'm talking about rock stars,
professional athletes, gangsters.

3686
02:51:14,306 --> 02:51:16,098
I'm telling you,
some real bad motherfuckers.

3687
02:51:16,183 --> 02:51:18,476
But this guy, my good friend,

3688
02:51:18,560 --> 02:51:21,312
Mr. Jordan Belfort, is the single

3689
02:51:21,396 --> 02:51:24,190
baddest motherfucker I have ever met.

3690
02:51:24,733 --> 02:51:26,442
So I want you right now

3691
02:51:26,526 --> 02:51:29,654
to give a warm Auckland,
New Zealand welcome

3692
02:51:29,738 --> 02:51:34,116
for my good friend
and the world's greatest sales trainer,

3693
02:51:34,201 --> 02:51:36,452
Mr. Jordan Belfort!

3694
02:51:47,422 --> 02:51:48,714
Thank you.

3695
02:52:11,697 --> 02:52:13,406
Sell me this pen.

3696
02:52:17,995 --> 02:52:20,037
It's...

3697
02:52:20,330 --> 02:52:22,081
It's an amazing pen.

3698
02:52:22,416 --> 02:52:24,583
For professionals, it's a...

3699
02:52:27,713 --> 02:52:29,422
Sell me this pen.

3700
02:52:30,424 --> 02:52:31,632
Well, it's a nice pen.

3701
02:52:31,717 --> 02:52:33,009
You can use the pen

3702
02:52:33,093 --> 02:52:36,303
to write down thoughts
from your life so you can...

3703
02:52:38,098 --> 02:52:41,434
Sell me this pen.

3704
02:52:43,437 --> 02:52:44,645
Well...

3705
02:52:45,022 --> 02:52:48,607
This pen works
and I personally love this pen...
