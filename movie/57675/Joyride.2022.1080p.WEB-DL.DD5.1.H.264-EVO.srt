1
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,136
Woo!

2
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,106
Woo!

3
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:22,780
I caught you!

4
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:27,718
Thanks, folks, for donating
to our hospice fundraiser.

5
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,554
We've made a pile of
money tonight.

6
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:30,755
Fair play to ya.

7
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,248
Go on, do it for Mam.

8
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:12,797
Hey, folks, here's a story about
Minnie the Moocher.

9
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,667
She was a lowdown
hoochie coocher.

10
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:20,304
She was the roughest,
toughest frail.

11
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:24,175
But Minnie had a heart
as big as a whale.

12
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,177
Hidee hidee hidee hi.

13
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,778
Hidee hidee hidee hi.

14
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,914
Hode hode hode ho.

15
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,749
Hode hode hode ho.

16
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,784
Hee dee hee dee hee dee hee.

17
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,686
Hee dee hee dee hee dee hee.

18
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,755
A hidee hidee hidee ho.

19
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,590
A hidee hidee hidee ho.

20
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:43,528
He gave her his
townhouse and his racing horses.

21
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,299
Each meal she ate
was a dozen courses.

22
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,602
She had a million dollars
worth of nickels and dimes.

23
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:55,373
She sat around and counted them
a million times.

24
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,475
Hidee hidee hidee hi.

25
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,310
Hidee hidee hidee hi.

26
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,412
Hode hode hode ho.

27
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,247
Hode hode hode ho.

28
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,349
Hee dee hee dee hee dee hee.

29
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,285
Hee dee hee dee hee dee hee.

30
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,287
A hidee hidee hidee ho.

31
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,556
A hidee hidee hidee ho.

32
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,691
A poor, poor Min.

33
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,395
A poor, poor Min.

34
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,297
A poor, poor Min.

35
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,332
A poor, poor Min.

36
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:23,201
Poor Min!

37
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,546
Dad, stop!

38
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:34,881
Put it back!

39
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,683
That money is for Ma.

40
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:38,483
Exactly.

41
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,687
What's for her, is for us.

42
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,722
She'd want us to have it.

43
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,525
You, me, your sister, the baby.

44
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,796
Not cheap having a new one
in the house.

45
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:52,865
Here.

46
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,273
Mully!

47
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:01,473
Mully!

48
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,277
Watch out, Sideline Sue!

49
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,579
Get back here!

50
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:12,884
Mully!

51
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,285
Mully!

52
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,388
I need that money!

53
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:16,787
Mully!

54
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,925
Oh... Oi, kid... Shit!

55
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,593
Come here!

56
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,639
That's my taxi!

57
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,707
What about your suitcase?!

58
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,308
Mully!

59
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,690
What the fuck?!

60
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:53,692
What the...

61
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,763
Erm... Er, no, no, no.

62
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,867
No, no, no, no!

63
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,510
Erm... er...

64
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,434
Fuckin' hell.

65
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,404
Oh, gotta dump this car.

66
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,675
Mully, you need to
come back now.

67
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,645
You're doing your mam
no favours.

68
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,449
She's after pulling a small
miracle for us.

69
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,949
Because that fella,
Paddy the taxi driver,

70
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,818
he thinks your one
stole the taxi.

71
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,486
So, there's no shades
involved...

72
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,488
...yet.

73
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,091
Come on, Mully.

74
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,894
Imelda and the baby'll miss ya.

75
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:11,938
Ah...

76
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:36,996
"Quanto es?"

77
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,867
Where are we?!

78
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,637
The Wheeler Dealer's field.

79
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:45,804
Who are you?!

80
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:49,073
We do not want the
Wheeler Dealer out.

81
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,745
What is going on?

82
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,512
What the fuck is going on?!

83
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,083
I didn't know yous were here
when I nabbed the motor.

84
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,619
Oh God!

85
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,152
Oh, this is all I need!

86
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,889
I haven't even left Lisbert yet.

87
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,123
Oh.

88
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,793
Oh God!

89
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,461
Uh!

90
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,063
I don't know what
the fuck you're on.

91
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,100
Uh!

92
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,507
It's okay.

93
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,643
Windies is it?

94
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,744
Yeah, it's okay.

95
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,047
It's okay.

96
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,756
Shhh.

97
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:44,831
It's okay.

98
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,100
It's okay.

99
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,506
Shhh...

100
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,876
SNIFFS

101
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,045
- Fresh outta the box?
- Urgh!

102
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,614
What is she, a week old?

103
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,151
I'll just take yous back
into town to get another taxi.

104
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,520
No! I'm going forward, not back.

105
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,124
Forward. I've a plane to catch
to Lanzarote at noon.

106
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,091
Uh...

107
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,562
And I've gotta get to
Droleen first.

108
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,231
I think she's hungry.

109
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,937
You wouldn't just throw her on
the bap, no?

110
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,071
Ugh!

111
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,608
Our Jess is mad for it.

112
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,641
You've a baby?

113
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,042
No.

114
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,011
She's my niece, but her dad's
kind of a no show,

115
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,548
so I'm basically her da.

116
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,084
That's handy.
You can share nappies.

117
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,746
Right where I left you.

118
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:13,818
Oh, shit.

119
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,892
Shut up ya flea sack!

120
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,107
What the fuck? You mentalist!

121
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,676
Right, you're gonna come with me
to look after the baby there

122
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,678
then you can do whatever
you want with the car.

123
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,179
It'll only take a couple
of hours... and in return-

124
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:47,251
And I can persuade the taxi
driver not to press charges.

125
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,320
You know, there's no crime if
nobody presses charges, right?

126
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,754
That's a proper legal thing.

127
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,890
I'm a solicitor, I know!

128
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,360
You need to shut that baby up,

129
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,894
'cause if the dealer comes out,
we're done.

130
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,129
He took someone's eye out with a
gear stick!

131
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:03,200
He was one of mine. He told me it
was an accident up the Pitch 'N Putt.

132
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,369
Anyways, you need to shut that
baby up.

133
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,271
You need to agree
this is a good plan for you.

134
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:11,308
This shit plan it is unless you
want a beating from that fella there

135
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,210
or me to press
charges about kidnapping!

136
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,350
We need to keep her quiet.

137
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:22,121
Shit!

138
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,643
I'm driving.

139
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,843
I know the back roads.

140
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,949
Where's your Mama gone?

141
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,649
Where's your Mama gone?

142
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,884
Little baby Don,

143
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,252
Little baby Don.

144
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:56,754
Where's your Mama gone?

145
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:07,091
Far, far away.

146
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:12,169
Last night I heard my Mama
singing a song,

147
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,873
Oooh-ee, chirpy chirpy
cheep cheep.

148
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,376
Woke up this morning
and my Mama was gone,

149
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:22,913
Oooh-ee, chirpy chirpy
cheep cheep.

150
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,451
Chirpy chirpy cheep
cheep, chirp.

151
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,304
No, seriously?

152
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,941
It's my car.

153
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,850
How is she there?
Is she too warm?

154
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,820
Hey, Vodka Tonic,
is she too warm?

155
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:03,821
She's fine.

156
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,390
Just feel the back of her neck
there. That's how you know.

157
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,159
Well, how do you know
if you won't check?

158
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,764
'Cause she's after giving me
a little thumbs up.

159
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,000
How do you know
I drink vodka tonic?

160
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,967
'Cause I work in The Hound.

161
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,204
I thought you knew that.

162
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,940
Jesus, you are mental!

163
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,740
I could be a complete killer.

164
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,974
I do know you now.

165
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,743
I've seen you sing in The Hound.

166
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,177
That stupid song.

167
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:33,152
Here folks, here's the story
about Minnie the Moocher.

168
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:37,389
She was a lowdown
hoochie coocher.

169
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,258
She was the roughest
toughest frail.

170
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,930
But Minnie had a heart
as big as a whale.

171
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,333
Hidee hidee hidee hi...

172
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,235
Hode hode hode ho.

173
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,369
I hate that song.

174
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,206
Oh, not as much as I do.

175
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,510
So, Vodka Tonic,
where you off to?

176
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,813
What's with the ball of money
rammed down your jocks?

177
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:08,187
Her lungs are the size of
two walnuts like.

178
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,500
What's the baby's name?

179
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,835
Petrol! I just realised!

180
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,517
- What's the baby's name?
- Watch the road!

181
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,478
- Oh!
- Agh!

182
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,115
Reverse over it. Quick!

183
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,384
It's a kindness. Quick!

184
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,886
No way!

185
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,045
It's in no pain now.

186
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,949
Breathe. Good deep breaths.

187
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,522
Hey, you know,
we did the right thing.

188
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:21,393
Seriously, it's actually illegal
to swerve to avoid an animal.

189
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,264
You're a dose, you are.

190
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,297
A fox-killing dose of mental!

191
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,379
Do you know what, I can't be
arsed to fight with you.

192
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,113
I wanna go to my aunt's.

193
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,648
Well, I'm going forward,
not back.

194
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,983
You can get out
whenever you want.

195
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,150
But it's my car!

196
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,988
And it'll be
all yours in Droleen.

197
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,658
Droleen is miles away!

198
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,004
Would you not just
feed her yourself?

199
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,241
Da says it like Dairymaster
up in our place.

200
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:13,212
You know, with my sister Imelda
trying to feed baby Jess and...

201
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,282
me helping the pups to latch.

202
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,619
You gotta make sure the weak
ones get the back tits.

203
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,190
I was trying to feed one
with a bottle, sure.

204
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,026
Have you seen
the video online where

205
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,597
a man's trying to feed
20 baby goats?

206
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,666
They have long white ears
like socks

207
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,003
sticking out of the sides
of their heads.

208
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,571
Oh, it's really funny.

209
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,469
No, no, no, you're kidding.

210
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,739
Is this a fucking joke?!

211
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,239
Argh!

212
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:21,478
We need to get petrol.
I've gotta get to Droleen.

213
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,351
There's a place about
five miles from here.

214
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,653
Me and Ma used to
drive around here.

215
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,656
She used to let me drive when we
went on the back roads.

216
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,258
- You stay here with the baby.
- We'll all go.

217
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,728
We're not taking her out in
the cold, you mentalist!

218
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,164
You're right, body heat.

219
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,104
Hey, little baba.

220
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,538
Where the fuck are we?

221
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:53,010
I'll tell you what, we'll play
question for question.

222
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,012
Alight?

223
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,212
Two rules.

224
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,448
You get one pass.

225
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,650
But you have to tell the truth.

226
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,222
Ya chicken.

227
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,227
- Come on!
- Go on, so...

228
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,062
Promise to tell the truth?

229
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,699
- Say it.
- I promise.

230
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,068
Alright, I'll go first.

231
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,804
What the fuck is in Droleen?

232
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,705
Two pubs, a post office and a
statue of a man

233
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,440
with a stick up a wren's arse.

234
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,142
Oh, fair play to ya.

235
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,146
And you bet into your
solicitor's head.

236
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:29,615
My question.

237
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,383
Is your dad James?

238
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,718
Yeah.

239
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
My turn.

240
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,257
Why are you going to Droleen?

241
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,661
Is the money stol...
I'll rephrase that.

242
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,231
Did you steal the money?

243
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,233
No, but...

244
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,700
- kind of.
- 'Kind of' doesn't cut it.

245
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:54,206
Look, I stole it from someone
who stole it in the first place.

246
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,176
Why are you going to visit them?

247
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,078
To give them something.

248
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,245
- From where or whom...
- Hang on.

249
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,383
That's two questions.
I'll answer the first one.

250
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,819
From The Hound.
Well, the Hospice, really.

251
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,755
What are you gonna give them?

252
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,722
Pass.
From the Rita Mulligan night?

253
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:15,160
No, you don't
get a pass on that one.

254
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,096
Are you giving them the baby?

255
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,867
Yes.
Do you want to give it back?

256
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,503
- What do you mean you're...
- Answer my question.

257
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:30,740
I caught my dad stealing the
money so I grabbed it off him.

258
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:33,178
'Cause I don't want to be
stealing from cancer.

259
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,214
...that's like
stealing from Ma.

260
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,251
Why are you giving them
the baby?

261
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,852
I don't want kids and Mags does.

262
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,489
Nah, you're panicking now.

263
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,690
I'm not panicking.
I'm totally prepared.

264
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:49,194
It's all arranged legally
and it's final.

265
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,796
You can't just give her away.
What about the dad?

266
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,166
You sound like you need yours
like a hole in the head.

267
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,535
- Likewise.
- The dad should know.

268
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,137
Even I know that.

269
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,538
You have to tell him.

270
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,208
Well, not if I don't know
who he is.

271
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,509
Not a clue.

272
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:08,614
Look, I didn't think
it could still happen.

273
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,451
Nobody, nobody gives away babies
these days.

274
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,620
Except for that guy, obviously.

275
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,226
People give babies
away all the time!

276
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:26,863
To child traffickers,
to Chinese gymnastic academies.

277
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,498
I'm giving mine
to a loving home, stone me.

278
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,699
You're being an arsehole now.

279
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,401
More women should take my lead

280
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,672
instead of dragging up
kids they never wanted.

281
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,705
They should be selfless enough
to give them

282
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,910
to women who
eat, sleep and dream babies.

283
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,179
There's enough
of them out there.

284
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,811
I've known Mags my whole life.

285
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,682
There's no better woman
for the job.

286
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,419
People have been staring at me
through their mouths

287
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,820
for the last four months.

288
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:57,227
You're mental you are.
Totally fuckin' mental.

289
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,831
No, I'm practical
and solution orientated.

290
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,599
Even my mother
wouldn't argue on that front.

291
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,401
Well, what does she have to
say about this?

292
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,238
Not much she can say
from a coffin.

293
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:10,542
She always said it was better for
everyone that I never wanted kids.

294
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,978
When did she die?

295
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,314
Nine months ago.

296
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:17,681
Yeah, the circle of life.

297
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,233
Will you get me cigarettes
and painkillers?

298
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,468
No, I need two hands
to fill the petrol can.

299
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,905
- I'll do that.
- No, I will!

300
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:41,840
Oh...

301
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,482
But I wanna give it back.
Dad!

302
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:31,917
Painkillers.

303
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:39,656
Ma wouldn't have wanted this.

304
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,693
Gifted is what it is, Mully.

305
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,395
JAMEDo you know where I am?

306
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,932
I'm at the kitchen table.

307
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,068
Ah, I can smell the perfume
off her jacket.

308
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,740
This was her favourite place
in the world.

309
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,974
That money is for her.

310
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,811
It's what'll keep us
here together.

311
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,648
If I don't sort what I owe,
I'm gone.

312
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,050
Huh?

313
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,153
If I'm gone, you're gone.

314
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,457
I don't wanna lose you, bud.

315
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,090
Huh?

316
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,397
So, we're gonna lose
the mentalist, right?

317
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,031
Did she er...

318
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,735
Did she see the money?

319
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,639
You're not far
from the ferry terminal.

320
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,739
Huh? Tell her.

321
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,776
Convince her.

322
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:34,177
I don't give a shit,
just get there.

323
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,715
I'll come get you from there.

324
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,583
Right?

325
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,519
Who has ya Mully?

326
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,754
Who has ya?

327
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,588
You do.

328
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,656
- Oh, there he is.
- Fuck.

329
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:47,690
Where's our money?

330
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:48,792
Just get there!

331
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,643
Right, so, me and Red Hurley

332
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,614
come up with this way back
when we were in the Nevada.

333
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,983
Nice fella, if you
like 'em nice.

334
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,886
He kept his head down and
the wheels on the road.

335
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:20,792
I got lost in a decade long
snowstorm if you catch my drift.

336
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,829
Sure, I'll just let you listen.

337
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,665
Just to prepare ya, I'm after
putting a few tweaks on it.

338
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,834
And my nephew threw
some beats over it.

339
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,035
Phat ones.

340
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,171
P H A T.

341
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,106
It's a new direction for me.

342
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,041
Jesus,

343
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:38,944
I'm nervous now.

344
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,010
I'm wondering, should
I play you the original

345
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,781
so you see where
I'm coming from?

346
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,952
Publish and be damned,
as the man says.

347
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,226
When we met in Ask eat on,

348
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,626
my heart got a beatin'

349
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,228
at the car boot sale.

350
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,863
I kept on your trail.

351
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:05,237
We passed those two days in a
love fuel led haze,

352
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,872
then I asked you to love me
and I got the third degree.

353
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:09,873
What's going on.

354
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,977
Are your eyes painted on?

355
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:14,546
Can't you see that I love ya?

356
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,746
Love is blind but you
my sweet are not...

357
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,014
P H A T!

358
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,184
You got it, kid.

359
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:25,788
Ah, deadly.

360
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:29,993
“Are your eyes painted on?
Can't you see that I love ya?”

361
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,297
LAUGHS I think they're my new
favourite lyrics.

362
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:38,904
I have to meet my dad
at the ferry.

363
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:40,839
What about your aunt?

364
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,807
Change of plan.

365
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,978
Whatever, but the ferry's a
detour we're not taking.

366
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,946
We're going straight to Droleen
as the crow flies

367
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:53,952
- You're kidnapping me?
- Ah Jesus Christ, the drama.

368
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:00,191
Turn around or I'll chuck this
out the window.

369
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,236
Get out and get that!

370
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,141
Only if you take me
to the ferry.

371
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,819
Little fucker,
get out of the car!

372
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,089
Get out of the car!

373
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,331
I'm sorry.

374
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:43,933
Hold that.

375
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:44,935
Hmm...

376
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,775
We're still not going
to the ferry.

377
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,156
I'm not missing that plane.

378
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,880
Check out the stray eyes on you.

379
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,282
No, your...

380
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,670
It happens to Imelda
all the time.

381
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,139
You must have been
feeding her yourself

382
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,342
if your milk's coming in.

383
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,779
They squirm up your body,
the nurse said,

384
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,414
the second they're born,
looking for tit.

385
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,949
Well, she didn't squirm up mine.

386
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:34,853
Well, something started
the pump going.

387
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,122
You must have...

388
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,259
Wait, did you pump?

389
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,695
- With the yellow yoke...
- Shut up!

390
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,197
Just shut up for a minute,
will ya?

391
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,168
Christ, I need to pee again.

392
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,840
Pass me the nappy bag.

393
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,709
Ah shit!
I need a wipe!

394
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,777
They're on the passenger seat.

395
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,313
I need a wipe!

396
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,220
Oh!

397
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,426
Ah.

398
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,336
What's the baby's name?

399
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,506
Come on, she has to have a name.

400
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,176
Robin.

401
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,258
Thought I might find you
in the driver's seat.

402
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:25,230
My name's Joy.

403
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:27,864
I know, false advertising.

404
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,332
Not the bringer of joy
apparently.

405
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,767
I didn't say that.

406
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,161
God bless online check in.

407
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,429
Are you really just
gonna give her up, like really?

408
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,298
Look, I know you think
I'm a witch,

409
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,135
but the baby's
getting a good deal.

410
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,337
Shit!

411
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,139
Crash maybe?

412
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,074
Will you run up and see?

413
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:14,878
Shit!

414
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:17,580
It's a checkpoint.

415
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:18,481
Fuck!

416
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,016
And us in a stolen car.

417
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,518
Droleen's just the other side.

418
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,955
There is none.
That's why they put it here.

419
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,123
Let's just go home.
You can get

420
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,226
I can't. I'm not going back,
I'm going forward.

421
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:31,396
I've a plane to catch.

422
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:37,402
Okay look, I've got this,
but you have to trust me.

423
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:41,304
Can I not just stay in the back
and be your son like?

424
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,206
This crew up here are
looking to bring something in.

425
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,908
And whether it's fair or not,
they don't like heads like yours.

426
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,311
Ah! This is mental.

427
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,346
Seriously, I can convince
anyone of anything.

428
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,048
I'm fucking one of
the smartest people I know

429
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,884
and I would not propose this
if I didn't think it was viable.

430
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,855
I have this,
you just have to trust me.

431
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:06,896
I've got nothing with me,
not even me handbag.

432
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,965
I've left me face at the bottom
of me wash bag

433
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,499
and, honest to goodness,
when I got the call from me mam

434
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,435
I just grabbed this banger.
It's me son's.

435
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:15,571
And my husband's away with
the car, the good one.

436
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,640
But me mam's just a mile down
the road there.

437
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,877
But the last time she fell she
was on the ground for two hours.

438
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,285
- Go on so.
- Ah.

439
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:28,885
Don't make a habit of it.

440
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,054
No.

441
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,140
You might just pop the boot
there for a minute.

442
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:17,433
A massive spider ran
down my body, bit my ankle!

443
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,567
I'll bite your ankle!

444
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,169
In the dark, Joy!

445
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,939
- Hairy legs on my skin.
- Ah get in, quick.

446
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,040
You had one job!

447
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,374
It could've been poisonous.

448
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,312
Hid in a banana truck
or something.

449
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:30,381
Shut up!

450
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:51,135
Right, we'll have
to go the ferry route after all.

451
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,303
I'll drop you off.

452
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,073
We'll need new wheels.

453
00:32:57,075 --> 00:33:01,212
You know, we could swap a car so
we're not really stealing.

454
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,720
This is worse than the Honda.

455
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:14,225
They may not report us if
they're getting an upgrade.

456
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,735
I can take the ferry
over to Droleen

457
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:28,239
and still get to my
friend's in plenty of time.

458
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:15,384
- Shit!
- You can wait for another.

459
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,053
You're not gonna make
your plane anyway.

460
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,087
I might.

461
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:21,259
If I drive round the estuary,
I can come in from there.

462
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,426
I'll use
the facilities first, though.

463
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:27,398
Stay here with the baby for a
minute then you can wait for your dad.

464
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:53,691
Fucker!

465
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,368
Have you seen a young fella?

466
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,842
Mully, come on out.

467
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,111
Just wait till my da comes.

468
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,580
- What?
- Just wait till my da comes!

469
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:18,647
No, I can't!

470
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,216
Come on, Joy!

471
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,617
Let him know you
won't say nothing

472
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,852
if he gives the money back.

473
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,420
Let him know you're
watching him, like.

474
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,288
Or, or... you're watching me!

475
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,556
I can't wait, Mully.

476
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:31,562
Look, come on out and I'll swap
you a burger for the key.

477
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,832
You told me to shut up earlier,
so I'm shutting up.

478
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,299
Mully!

479
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,170
Ugh!

480
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:47,610
Gimme the car keys, Mully,
and I'll come and find you

481
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:49,881
when I'm back from Lanzarote.
How about that?

482
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,353
What is it, four grand?
I have that, easy!

483
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,922
Give me the keys and I'll write
an IOU, I promise.

484
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,527
And I never break
my promises ever! Ask anyone.

485
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,837
Hidee hidee hidee hi.

486
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:24,747
“Home-cut potato wedges covered
with our famous curry sauce

487
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:28,252
with a creamy side portion
of coleslaw.”

488
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,725
Here, Mully, give her
a last bottle, please.

489
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:40,563
Come on, Mully, I'll mind that
for you, it'll take you five minutes.

490
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:44,600
How about you start and I'll come
find you once I get these in my belly.

491
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:48,306
What mother leaves both of
her children go hungry?

492
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,841
And you can fuck off with your
pass remarkables.

493
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,776
Anyway, he's not my son.

494
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:54,778
He's the father.

495
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,353
She's only taking the piss,
by the way.

496
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:05,990
She doesn't even know
who the father is.

497
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:16,934
Do you need to feed her?

498
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:21,339
Nip in there,
get some privacy for yourself.

499
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,775
I'm heading off for a bit,
so just close the door after.

500
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,670
Okay.

501
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:08,519
Okay.

502
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,569
There's no more formula.

503
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,673
Why'd you have no more formula?

504
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:07,976
Because you burst the last one
with your Fast and Furious routine.

505
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:10,546
I had exactly enough for a
simple straight up trip,

506
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:13,415
not this coastal road
fiasco we're on.

507
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:14,717
Well, you won't get none here.

508
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,687
Joy, you're gonna have to feed
her yourself.

509
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,421
Joy...

510
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:20,689
Joy, just try it.

511
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,127
I have tried.
I was trying before.

512
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,997
Look, it's tricky at first.
Our Imelda...

513
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,399
Look, she
doesn't want me, Mully.

514
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,767
She won't even
take a bottle from me.

515
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:35,606
No, Joy, you just think that she
doesn't want you.

516
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:46,415
Right, chillax, okay?
Get them shoulders up.

517
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:47,783
You wanna wear her
right across you.

518
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,017
You don't want her dragging.

519
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:51,122
That's how the nurse
showed our Imelda.

520
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,093
You're doing great.

521
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,630
She's rooting.

522
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:03,434
Come on, Robin,
open your little beak.

523
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:05,636
Come on.

524
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,775
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

525
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,710
So, Imelda says you can feel it
coming from your back.

526
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,011
Can you feel that?

527
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:23,621
You did it.

528
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,035
You just baptised her there.

529
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:47,878
Come with me, Mully.

530
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,847
Let's still get on that ferry

531
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,783
and we'll figure out
how to give the money back.

532
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,686
What about my Da?

533
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,088
We'll figure that out too.

534
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:00,122
Do you promise?

535
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,824
I promise.

536
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,961
We're going forward, not back.

537
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,999
Ladies and gentlemen,

538
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,869
welcome on board
with Shannon Ferry.

539
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:16,974
Our trip will take approximately
20 minutes.

540
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,111
What about Robin?

541
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:24,913
She's sleeping. Not a peep.

542
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,049
The fella can see her
from his little perch.

543
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:28,853
It's my first time on a boat.

544
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,922
I can't really swim,
but I love the sea.

545
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:36,260
I hate water. I don't get
my hair wet as a rule.

546
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,197
I love just putting my head
under and hearing...

547
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,867
well, nothing like

548
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:47,169
Sometimes I hitch out
and sit on our beach.

549
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:50,873
The one with the pink cart thing
and the big beach sign.

550
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,576
I don't go to beaches.

551
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,279
That beach reminds me of Ma.

552
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:58,916
Only Da knows I go there,
and now you.

553
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,984
Here, the wind'll get you up
here.

554
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:06,188
The bloody super moon is wrecking
havoc with the tides.

555
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,589
Is the baby still asleep?

556
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:08,659
Yeah.

557
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,296
I'm not putting that on.
The cut of it.

558
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,135
Ah, go on, so...

559
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,306
Here...

560
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,875
Here, see if
you recognise this one.

561
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:37,786
You and I forever and ever.

562
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:41,256
No matter where you are,

563
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:44,259
you're my guiding star.

564
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:48,297
And from the very first moment
I saw you,

565
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:51,867
I've never felt such emotion.

566
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:55,170
I'm walking on air.
- Yes, you are.

567
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,205
- Just to know...
- Just to know...

568
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:59,675
You are there!

569
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:03,278
Hold me in your arms,
don't let me go.

570
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,650
I want to stay forever.

571
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:09,985
Closer each day,

572
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:14,058
Home and Away.

573
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,258
- YAY!
- That's it now.

574
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,663
- I have to pee.
- Check the baby!

575
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:23,000
You've a new baby in the house?

576
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:25,603
Same as ours.

577
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,905
You're a good
big brother, though.

578
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,607
Not like our wee fella.

579
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,675
He's very put out.

580
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,812
Thinks we'll only
half love him now.

581
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,881
I've tried to tell him there's
no fractions in play.

582
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:40,884
You can't half love a child.

583
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:46,989
Here, I have to get back to
me cage.

584
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:47,990
Keep the whistle.

585
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:49,891
Throw us in them jackets after.

586
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:51,128
They're not mine.

587
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,392
She was mooching a bit.

588
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,295
You know who she looks like
in that hat?

589
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:28,864
Sideline Sue.

590
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:30,232
She was an accountant.

591
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:31,368
Solicitor.

592
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:33,935
Imagine her all,
"Yes, Your Honour!"

593
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:35,270
She was actually
the best in Kerry.

594
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,940
Did my work experience
under her.

595
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:39,174
You know, my Ma
gave her that hat?

596
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,411
To cover her scar.

597
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,280
She told me an angel
gave her that hat.

598
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,916
Da says she's
dangerously honest.

599
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,152
Oh, there they are now.

600
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:51,955
The half orphan and the...

601
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:54,056
Ah, what does she call you?

602
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,325
Oh, Reckless Joy.

603
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:56,992
Hey, that could be
our band name.

604
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:58,727
Reckless Joy and
the Half Orphan.

605
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:22,484
Here...

606
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:27,324
He's about 13,
brown hair, skinny...

607
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:29,993
Are you his father
or her partner?

608
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,227
What?

609
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,866
That wagon should have taken
another ferry months ago.

610
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,168
Oh!

611
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,270
Fuck it!

612
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,516
How'd that little fella get all
the way out here?

613
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:57,018
You know, in our house,
robin is Ma.

614
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:02,092
And we're off. Thanks Rita.

615
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,264
I'm sorry about your mam.

616
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:10,465
I knew her a bit from The Hound.

617
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:12,334
And from school, we were
in the same year, you know.

618
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:15,937
She said she was in the bottom
class. Were you in the top?

619
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,107
Mm-hmm.

620
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,341
Jesus, she was so good looking.

621
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:21,409
Even the women teachers
would defer to her.

622
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:23,078
What do you mean?
Pick on her?

623
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,349
Oh no, the opposite,
be much nicer to her.

624
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,467
Look, you can see the outline
of her lips there.

625
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:48,505
She'd come in after work and
give me a kiss on the cheek.

626
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:52,843
And I'd wake up with a big
kiss mark on my cheek.

627
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,413
She loved my cheeks.

628
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,483
Hamster cheeks, she said.

629
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,518
'Cause I was so small.

630
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:08,091
I'm pleased someone gave you
a childhood, Mully.

631
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,912
I saw my mam putting on
lipstick once.

632
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:32,082
I was about seven years old.

633
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:39,323
In one of them caravans
up near Phelan's Pipe.

634
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,526
Didn't really want to
see my dad.

635
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,294
Well, well, I did and I didn't.

636
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:48,298
I just really wanted
to go swimming.

637
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,866
But me mam...

638
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:35,045
But then I looked
over the dune to see...

639
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,248
What do you see?

640
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:44,219
Do you know how lucky you are
to have had your Rita, Mully?

641
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:46,490
All that good stuff to pass on.

642
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,159
She'll have you.

643
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:53,497
One feed doesn't mean
I'm keeping her, Mully.

644
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,067
I don't know what I'm doing.

645
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:00,537
It's why I need to think about
it more at home.

646
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:09,144
- Oh...
- What?

647
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:10,445
What is it?

648
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:13,248
Can't believe I'm driving a
fuckin' stolen car

649
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,450
with a minor
and I ran a checkpoint.

650
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,618
I know.

651
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:20,490
You were on one, alright.
- Oh, my Christ, I'm mental.

652
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,262
I am, I'm mental!

653
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:29,030
I can claim postpartum
psychosis.

654
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:31,468
Oh, Jesus, I'm good!

655
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:35,170
I finally get to reap the
benefits of my own brilliance.

656
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:37,607
Ah.

657
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:51,288
Oh, shit!

658
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,028
- Shit.
- Leave it to me, Mully.

659
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:06,534
- Mulser.
- What happened to your nose?

660
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,772
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

661
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,073
We're gonna lose
the mentalist now, right?

662
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:14,177
She's big enough,
she can go her own way.

663
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:18,582
Socks and jocks in the pocket.

664
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,449
Mully's coming with me.

665
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:23,053
He is in his fuck!

666
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:26,523
You're a piece of work,
aren't ya?

667
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,257
Forcing a child to drive you
up the country

668
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:31,061
so you can give your baby away?

669
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:34,696
You're forcing a child
to keep stolen charity money

670
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,333
that he wants to give back.

671
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,468
Well...

672
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:42,039
If there was stolen money,

673
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,509
I'll be sure to
make him give it back.

674
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:47,477
Isn't that right, Mully?

675
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:49,513
Isn't it, Mully?

676
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:55,218
Right, get in the car.

677
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,720
I'll volunteer a witness
statement about the stolen money.

678
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,322
Don't even try get your
solicitor routine on.

679
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:02,724
You've enough on your plate
with your own pup

680
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,494
without interfering with mine!

681
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:08,398
Back the fuck off!

682
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:14,671
Oh...

683
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,645
Can we say goodbye so
without you looming nearby?

684
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,283
Joy, you need to come with us.

685
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:30,351
You can't drive,
you'll kill the baby.

686
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:38,695
Da, a lift.
She's not feeling well.

687
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:43,266
Hey!

688
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:47,435
- You're headed for Droleen?
- No, she's changed her mind.

689
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,574
- She's coming with us.
- Mully, can you shut up for a minute!

690
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:56,311
Right, we'll agree, what went
on tour stays on tour.

691
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:58,215
On both sides, right?

692
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:00,817
I always keep my promises.

693
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,654
Wipe down the Mazda, Mully.

694
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,836
For fuck's sake, her lungs are
the size of two walnuts.

695
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:57,605
I need to get out!
Let me out!

696
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,511
Let me out!

697
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:03,747
Let me out!

698
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:41,484
Joy! Joy! Joy!

699
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:44,586
Tie this around your waist.
- But why?

700
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:48,558
Er, behind ya, there's er...
blood.

701
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:50,358
Oh, I need a shower.

702
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,695
It's okay, it's okay.

703
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:53,528
Deep breaths, deep breaths.

704
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,597
Good woman, good woman.
In and out.

705
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,565
- I need a shower.
- In and out.

706
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,967
It's okay, it's okay.

707
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:00,670
Deep breath.

708
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:05,873
It's okay.

709
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,744
- It's okay.
- I need a shower.

710
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:10,447
Joy, Joy, come here.

711
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,313
Why don't you
get a drag of that.

712
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:14,882
You'll be alright, huh?
Get a drag of that now.

713
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:16,686
We'll have you sorted.

714
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:19,821
I know a B&B up the road.
Huh?

715
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:21,789
We'll get you there, no problem.

716
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:24,359
I use it for me smoke runs.
That's it.

717
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:25,960
Good woman, you're doing great.

718
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:28,765
Don't you worry now, we'll have
you sorted in no time.

719
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:30,767
Only a wee bit up the road.

720
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:45,480
Oh, my little ball of butter.

721
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:48,549
And you must be young Paul,
still mad for cars I suppose.

722
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:50,351
- And Rita...
- I need a shower.

723
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:51,486
Of course.

724
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:53,321
I've put you in the family room.

725
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:54,656
The door's open.

726
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:57,892
But it'll be a bath 'cause the
shower head's gone.

727
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:58,855
I need that money.

728
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:01,556
Look...

729
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:03,760
those greyhounds have me
in real trouble.

730
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,471
Maybe Joy could help you.

731
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:16,473
Would you leave her off?

732
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:19,140
The saucy solicitor.

733
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:20,608
That poor little girl there.

734
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,746
- She hasn't any hope.
- Shush!

735
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,446
Right, this is the plan.

736
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:29,083
I'll take you back and you'll
say you got attacked

737
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:31,955
and lost the money to some wino
before I could get to ya.

738
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:33,921
And you only took the money
in the first place

739
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:36,457
cause you wanted to buy
that big buggy for Jess.

740
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:38,126
No, one'll be mad with ya.

741
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:41,798
And if someone does want to
press charges, which they won't,

742
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:44,434
but if they do,

743
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,434
you're a minor with no former.

744
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,505
It'll be nothing but
a slap on the wrists.

745
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:50,073
Huh?

746
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,077
Right, I'm gonna head down
to the local.

747
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,920
It's a wonderful,
peaceful time of day.

748
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:38,888
Okay.

749
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:48,196
She's not feeding, Mully,
will you help me?

750
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,099
You need to do it yourself.

751
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,535
Please, just one more time.

752
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:56,873
Alright.

753
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:59,742
Sit up there on the bed
and relax.

754
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:06,616
Right back against the headboard
and grab them pillows.

755
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,220
Try the other side.

756
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:53,594
- Hello?
- Mags?

757
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:54,731
Joy...

758
00:58:57,567 --> 00:59:00,067
Joy, you've changed your mind.
I know it.

759
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:02,906
- I've been calling.
- I had the baby.

760
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,839
She came early,
I had her naturally.

761
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,707
What?! When?
We would have...

762
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,645
No. I didn't want anyone there.

763
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:10,813
Are you alright?

764
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:13,748
Is she?
- Yeah, she's feeding well.

765
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,250
Are you pumping the colostrum?
She needs that.

766
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:19,022
Oh Jesus, I forgot to bring
the pump down.

767
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,724
Actually, I'm feeding her
myself.

768
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:45,880
This could be
the making of you, Joy.

769
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:48,115
Mags, I haven't decided
anything yet.

770
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:50,653
Ok? I just need more time.
That's all I know now.

771
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:54,324
I'm sorry.

772
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,260
I'm all churned up.

773
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:03,800
Remember that day Mam
took me to Phelan's Pipe

774
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:06,734
and she saw Dad with that
young one in the pink bikini?

775
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:09,772
Yeah, that wet summer.

776
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:12,909
I didn't tell you all of it.

777
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:18,648
I think I'm only really after
remembering...

778
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:21,284
A lot of things
are coming up now.

779
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,187
You've been turned inside out.

780
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,056
On the way home I kept saying,

781
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:30,891
“I just wanted to
go swimming, Ma."

782
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:33,828
And eventually she turned
into this small beach somewhere

783
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,666
and I ran straight into the sea.

784
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:38,866
And I could see her
on the shore.

785
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:42,069
I think she was crying
and I was messing about,

786
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:43,804
splashing, playing.

787
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:48,778
And then a current got me and
I could feel the pull on me.

788
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:53,182
And, er...

789
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:58,821
my head kept going under and I
was shouting at her and waving.

790
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:01,889
And I could see her
looking out to me.

791
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:05,728
And then I saw her
look left right.

792
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:09,230
Mum!
Help!

793
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:13,067
Mum! Mum! Mum!

794
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:17,106
And I realise now
she was checking...

795
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:20,043
considering.

796
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:22,810
Oh, Joy.

797
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:24,445
And I kept shouting at her,
“Mam, Mam!”

798
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:26,149
I was coughing and then...

799
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,283
My head kept going under,
then I couldn't shout anymore

800
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:31,087
and I just went under.

801
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,027
Eventually she came and
dragged me out

802
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:42,231
and I coughed up
all over the wet sand.

803
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:49,138
She bought me an ice cream
on the way home.

804
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:55,178
She's gone now, Joy.
Gone.

805
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:58,915
Yeah, it doesn't feel like that.

806
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:06,989
Did you give her a name?

807
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,158
Robin.

808
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:12,493
Is she a pure beaut?

809
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:15,998
Yeah, she is, Mags.

810
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:18,432
Although sometimes I think
she looks like

811
01:02:18,434 --> 01:02:20,868
Simon Mulvaney's dad
if he was a turtle.

812
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,477
Shhh...

813
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,952
Oh, Mags.

814
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:43,390
Listen, I've got to
go now, Mags.

815
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:45,292
Bear with me, okay?

816
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:48,364
Night, Joy.
I love you.

817
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:00,409
- Rita!
- Oh!

818
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:02,143
A little tipple?

819
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:04,278
No, thanks, Noreen.
I shouldn't, the baby.

820
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,847
Sure, this is practically milk!

821
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:09,051
I suppose it is.

822
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:11,252
Could I trouble you, do you have
the number of a taxi

823
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:12,953
I could use in the morning?

824
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:15,055
I wanna get away
on the road early.

825
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:16,791
Leave the two lads
there to sleep on.

826
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,362
Oh, I can do better than that.

827
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:28,337
You are as lovely as James
always said you were.

828
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:32,208
“Everybody loves Rita,”
he'd say.

829
01:05:54,517 --> 01:06:00,656
It took a little time
to get where I wanted

830
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:08,130
It took a little time
to get free

831
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:18,741
It took a little time
to be honest

832
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:24,979
It took a little time to be me

833
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:29,085
To find courage

834
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:33,287
It's a feeling like no other

835
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:36,991
Let me tell you, yeah

836
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:39,293
Courage

837
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:45,766
The sweet belief of knowing
nothing comes for free

838
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:47,234
Listen, Mully,
come back with me now

839
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:48,335
We'll take the money straight
to The Hound.

840
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,204
I already gave it
back to my dad.

841
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:53,275
No, Mully, I have the money.
I found it last night.

842
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,242
But...

843
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:56,677
He'll go hulk, Joy.

844
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,645
He needs that money -
he's trying to keep us together.

845
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:01,784
He needs the money. He's not
thinking about what you need.

846
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:06,587
I see a lazy user dad who's
taken all the beautiful things

847
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:09,458
out of his son's life to line
his own pockets.

848
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:11,492
Rita wouldn't be happy
about that money,

849
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,227
and I think you know that.

850
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:14,395
And I think that's why
you stole it back

851
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:16,098
off him in the first place.

852
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:18,332
Without him, Joy,
I'd be in a home.

853
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:20,701
With him you'll be in St Pats
graduating to prison.

854
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,471
Don't kid yourself.

855
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:25,305
Listen, Mully,
I have parents in court with me

856
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:26,774
who would literally peel
their own skin off

857
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:30,377
if it meant could save their
baby from a moment's hurt.

858
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:33,682
Parents should put their
children first.

859
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:37,117
- But you were going to...
- You've a right to a childhood.

860
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,419
You don't have to love your dad

861
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:40,187
just as I didn't have to
love my mum.

862
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:41,555
We're not obliged to love them.

863
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:44,193
He will keep using you
until you're spent.

864
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:51,098
You know, what the fuck
do you know anyway?

865
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,499
You were going to piss off
to Lanzarote.

866
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:54,470
At least my dad wants to
keep me.

867
01:07:56,338 --> 01:07:57,740
But, you know,
you're right, Joy.

868
01:07:58,307 --> 01:08:01,141
Robin here would be better off
without a saucy,

869
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:04,513
vodka-tonic fucking
mentalist for a ma!

870
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:21,261
No, Joy, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have...

871
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:22,663
Well, at least I won't
inflict myself on her...

872
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:25,499
Joy, stop, just...
Help me give the money back so.

873
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:32,374
Yeah, I've seen better tits
on a greyhound!

874
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:40,714
Thank Christ!

875
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:42,318
We're gonna go after grub.

876
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:44,887
Noreen...

877
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:46,689
Here, quick.

878
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:48,491
Third drawer down.

879
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:51,861
Come on to fuck will ya?
Hurry up!

880
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,395
- See in there?
- Yeah.

881
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:57,197
Just skim a few notes
off the top.

882
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:58,265
That way she'll think
she's going mad

883
01:08:58,267 --> 01:08:59,535
and hasn't been robbed.

884
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:03,739
C'mon, hurry the fuck...

885
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:07,776
Noreen, any chance
of them famous eggs?

886
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:12,348
Come on...

887
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:44,340
Joy!

888
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:45,808
Joy!

889
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:47,910
Joy!

890
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,012
Not like this!

891
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,020
Okay.

892
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,735
What the fuck?

893
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:48,737
What's going on?

894
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:56,777
Hey! What's going on?

895
01:11:56,779 --> 01:11:57,844
Shaft's jammed!

896
01:11:57,846 --> 01:11:59,313
Will you be long will ya?

897
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,681
I'll be done when I'm done.

898
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:02,916
Fuck's sake.

899
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:06,989
Mully! Mully!

900
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,697
Mully!

901
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:25,739
Do you have any seats on
any planes

902
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:27,074
going bloody anywhere?

903
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:29,710
There are still seats on
our daily flight to Lanzarote.

904
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:30,944
Will I book that for you?

905
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:35,584
If you coujust have
your credit card ready there.

906
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:41,988
Good
morning ladies and gentlemen,

907
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:44,624
Air Lingus flight 808
to Lanzarote

908
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:47,060
will shortly be
boarding at gate two.

909
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:51,400
Air Lingus flight Lanzarote
shortly boarding at gate two.

910
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:09,009
- I have to get off.
- I really need you to sit down.

911
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:10,710
I really need to get off.

912
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:11,912
Well, the doors are closed.

913
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:13,613
Oh, doors open,
that's what they do.

914
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:15,751
- The stairs is...
- The stairs is still there.

915
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:18,685
Look, I need to get off.
I've nothing but this bag.

916
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:20,456
It's as easy as
opening that door.

917
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:22,923
I've a right to get off
this plane.

918
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:24,991
Aye, you might have us on board,

919
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:27,727
but you'll never take
our freedom!

920
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:31,665
If you insist on getting off,

921
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:33,233
we'll have to change
all figures,

922
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:34,901
notify the boarding staff,

923
01:14:34,903 --> 01:14:36,770
get a bus to bring you
off the runway,

924
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:39,206
employ ramp staff
to bring back the stairs.

925
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:41,508
You'll not only be causing
inconvenience to...

926
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:42,976
The stairs are still there.

927
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:45,545
Look, number one, you're
minus one in your figures

928
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:49,015
Two, I'll notify boarding
staff as I'm leaving.

929
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:50,183
Three, I'll pass
on the bus, thanks.

930
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:51,785
I could spit at the terminal
from here.

931
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:54,054
And four,
the stairs is still there!

932
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:55,789
The stairs is still there!

933
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:57,624
The stairs is still there!

934
01:14:57,626 --> 01:14:59,094
The stairs is still there!

935
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:00,927
The stairs is still there!

936
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:03,899
The stairs is still there!

937
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:08,170
The stairs is still there!

938
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:11,106
After promises and laughter

939
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:16,044
After Saturday in song,

940
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:20,849
After Happy Ever After,

941
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:25,621
Went and crossed the Rubicon,

942
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:28,889
On misdemeanour days,

943
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:31,758
on those grass-is-greener days,

944
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:35,197
when the road starts calling me,

945
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:38,632
Just before I leave,

946
01:15:38,634 --> 01:15:40,534
something tugs my sleeve,

947
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:43,303
tells me that I'm where
I need to be

948
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:47,173
It's the light
that's in your face,

949
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:50,577
It's the colours that you chase,

950
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:52,846
So bring on stormy weather,

951
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:54,781
this show will run forever,

952
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:57,117
It's the laughter in your eyes,

953
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:59,753
It's the whisper of surprise,

954
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:01,755
Gonna see me through...

955
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:02,791
Hi, Ma.

956
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:06,628
Keeps me coming back to you.

957
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:11,199
Keeps me coming back to you

958
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:04,911
That's it for
another year, lads.

959
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:06,314
Two pints each on me.

960
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:08,216
No spirits!

961
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:10,252
No spirits?

962
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:20,796
NO! NO! No! Oh my God!

963
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:24,700
Come on!

964
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:29,004
I don't wanna go this way.
I need to go that way!

965
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:31,073
I need a mechanic.

966
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:34,109
I need a mechanic or a car.

967
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:38,146
I've got money.
I... urgh!

968
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:47,789
Ah, fuck off!

969
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:52,828
Where were you going?

970
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:57,232
Lisbert.

971
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:58,967
Where's your baby?

972
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:04,270
You know, he tore off in an ice
cream van earlier.

973
01:19:04,272 --> 01:19:06,408
He tried my Mini first, like.

974
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:09,945
- Was he alone?
- Yeah.

975
01:19:10,345 --> 01:19:12,479
I need to get to him before
someone else.

976
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:13,847
Where's your Mini now?

977
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:15,415
Parked up by the butchers.
Why?

978
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:16,850
Can I rent it for the day?

979
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:17,886
No.

980
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:24,124
I can drive it though.

981
01:19:24,126 --> 01:19:27,796
I've got my provisional but
I just need a responsible adult.

982
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:31,299
I'm a responsible adult!

983
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:39,174
The baby's in her new home.

984
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:41,543
- Huh?
- You asked earlier.

985
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:43,411
Oh.

986
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:50,352
Turn here.

987
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,326
I see you lost the young fella.

988
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:02,330
I didn't fucking lose him!

989
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,964
That mentalist friend of yours
kidnapped him.

990
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:08,036
I hope he's miles away.
Somewhere safe.

991
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:50,378
Come with me, Mully.

992
01:20:51,246 --> 01:20:52,447
Why?

993
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:55,116
Are you gonna adopt me?

994
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:57,951
Are you gonna
take me to the sun?

995
01:20:57,953 --> 01:21:02,424
- I'm not going to Lanzarote now.
- No, cos you're a user.

996
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:05,327
Just like my dad.

997
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:10,298
I might as well go with him,
'cause at least he's family.

998
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:13,066
I'm gonna help you make things
right with the charity money.

999
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:15,170
I can do that on my own.

1000
01:21:15,437 --> 01:21:17,604
What do you want
me to do, Mully? Tell me.

1001
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:19,873
I want you to fuck off and
leave me alone.

1002
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:22,308
Stop rubbing your leaky tits
up against my dad.

1003
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:24,477
Stop promising things!

1004
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:27,082
I can't fuck off, Mully,
and I won't.

1005
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:35,156
Where's Robin?

1006
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:38,560
With Mags.

1007
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:48,904
My ma would have
peeled her skin off for me.

1008
01:21:49,638 --> 01:21:51,504
I know she would, Mully.

1009
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:53,208
In a heartbeat.

1010
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:57,210
Mully, get behind me.

1011
01:21:57,212 --> 01:21:59,114
Mully, get up.
Get behind me.

1012
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:03,652
Here we go... Piss off!

1013
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:05,487
Now, Mully,

1014
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:08,690
here, who has ya?

1015
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:10,926
Who has ya, huh?

1016
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:12,327
You do.

1017
01:22:13,695 --> 01:22:15,261
Leave him alone!

1018
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:18,333
- Da!
- Uh...

1019
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:21,034
You want to play mam?

1020
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:22,468
Stop! Da, stop!

1021
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:24,272
You want to be Rita, huh?

1022
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:27,173
You, you can't get rid of your
own blood quick enough!

1023
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:30,045
But someone else's
is fuckin' fair game, huh?

1024
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:32,578
- Dad, stop!
- Mully!

1025
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:38,718
Do you know what they say about
you in The Hound?

1026
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,586
- Giving it out in the cubicles.
- Argh!

1027
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:42,424
Argh!

1028
01:22:43,725 --> 01:22:46,326
- Mully, you little...
- Get off me!

1029
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:51,266
Leave me alone, the pair of ya!

1030
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:55,203
Mully!

1031
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:58,073
Mully!

1032
01:22:58,306 --> 01:22:59,474
Mully!

1033
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:02,377
Muzzer!

1034
01:23:07,048 --> 01:23:08,750
Mully, come back out!

1035
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:15,557
Mully, I'm sorry.
We'll give it back!

1036
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:18,460
Come on, Mully.
We'll forget the whole thing.

1037
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:28,303
Mully!

1038
01:23:38,146 --> 01:23:39,547
Fuck.

1039
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:46,187
Mully!
Come back out, you can't swim!

1040
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:01,034
Argh!

1041
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:06,408
Oh!

1042
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:10,276
Mully!

1043
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:16,149
Mully!

1044
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:22,390
Mully!

1045
01:24:23,825 --> 01:24:25,527
I'm coming, Mully.

1046
01:25:03,164 --> 01:25:05,800
It's okay, it's okay.

1047
01:25:07,202 --> 01:25:08,803
I've got you, Mully.

1048
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:35,230
It'll come around,

1049
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:38,698
even on the hardest day.

1050
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:41,569
Maybe you will hear the sound,

1051
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:45,138
of what your heart
is trying to say,

1052
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:48,241
Just like a soft rain
coming down.

1053
01:25:48,243 --> 01:25:49,575
Oh... Mully!

1054
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:54,282
It'll come around,
around, around...

1055
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:58,784
It'll come around,
around, around...

1056
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:00,221
Mully!

1057
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:02,788
- Mulzer!
- I've got you Mully.

1058
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:07,929
I know you feel as though
we've fallen out

1059
01:26:08,563 --> 01:26:10,429
But I'm right behind you,
JAMES SHOUTS: Mully!

1060
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:15,268
So there'll be no doubt.

1061
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:16,569
Mully, will you look at me!

1062
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:18,673
It'll come around,

1063
01:26:19,407 --> 01:26:21,908
and you'll be
left to wonder why,

1064
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:25,480
There ever had to be a cloud,

1065
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:28,214
up there in the great blue sky,

1066
01:26:28,216 --> 01:26:32,287
Something you lost
and then you found.

1067
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:36,891
It'll come around,
around, around...”

1068
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:43,198
Yeah, it'll come around,
around, around...”

1069
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:48,937
...around, around,
around, around...

1070
01:26:51,806 --> 01:26:53,474
...around...

1071
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:14,495
She hasn't stopped crying
since you left.

1072
01:27:14,762 --> 01:27:16,431
She wants her mammy.

1073
01:27:17,298 --> 01:27:19,000
I don't know, Mags.

1074
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,636
Joy, you can do this.

1075
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:24,503
You had the best teacher
in the world.

1076
01:27:24,505 --> 01:27:26,708
My mam.

1077
01:27:26,975 --> 01:27:29,277
Just do everything
she didn't do.

1078
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:39,954
I just have to love her, so...

1079
01:27:51,599 --> 01:27:52,967
Here they are now.

1080
01:27:53,368 --> 01:27:55,935
Reckless Joy
and the Half Orphan.

1081
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:57,405
Hiya, Sue.

1082
01:27:57,538 --> 01:27:59,474
- There you go.
- Thanks.

1083
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:06,648
You took a gallop
up the country?

1084
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:11,019
Through a police checkpoint
in a stolen car.

1085
01:28:13,021 --> 01:28:15,821
But I've come to my senses now,
Your Honour.

1086
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:17,056
I was suffering from...

1087
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:20,795
Postpartum psychosis.

1088
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:23,498
You're on it.

1089
01:28:25,066 --> 01:28:27,568
A little bird told me
you had a girl.

1090
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:29,937
How're you feeling?

1091
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:34,008
Ready to love the living shit
out of her.

1092
01:28:34,342 --> 01:28:35,543
And him.

1093
01:28:37,745 --> 01:28:40,415
Will you come up tomorrow,
meet your newest mentee.

1094
01:28:40,782 --> 01:28:42,717
See if she's up to scratch.

1095
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:51,092
What's she crying about?

1096
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:52,927
Oh, tears of joy.

1097
01:28:55,797 --> 01:28:57,965
I hope.
LAUGHS

1098
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:09,644
That poor baby's been dragged
around the place willy-nilly.

1099
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:14,380
Here, I erm...

1100
01:29:14,382 --> 01:29:15,481
I didn't mean what I said

1101
01:29:15,483 --> 01:29:16,949
about your tits
being like greyhounds.

1102
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:17,983
You've great tits.

1103
01:29:17,985 --> 01:29:19,085
I know.

1104
01:29:22,123 --> 01:29:23,823
Simon Mulvaney said I
had better tits

1105
01:29:23,825 --> 01:29:25,091
than Rebekah Elmaloglou.

1106
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:28,596
She was the hottie in Home and
Away when I was at school.

1107
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:30,898
You had Home and Away back then?

1108
01:29:31,132 --> 01:29:33,532
Jesus, I didn't even think
you had TV.

1109
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:35,703
And you bet into
your comedian pants.

1110
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:38,906
You know you will adopt me.

1111
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:40,808
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1112
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:43,542
- Pretty cocksure of yourself.
- Mm-hmm.

1113
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:45,478
I broke ya.
- Yeah.

1114
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:48,649
These hamster cheeks broke ya.

1115
01:29:50,752 --> 01:29:53,018
- Mam used to let me drive.
- Yeah?

1116
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:54,086
So, can I drive?

1117
01:29:54,088 --> 01:29:55,921
- Yeah.
- Deadly!

1118
01:29:55,923 --> 01:29:57,490
In three and a half years time.

1119
01:29:57,492 --> 01:29:59,892
You're suddenly
all responsible now?

1120
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:04,663
Nah. Once a mentalist,
always a mentalist.
