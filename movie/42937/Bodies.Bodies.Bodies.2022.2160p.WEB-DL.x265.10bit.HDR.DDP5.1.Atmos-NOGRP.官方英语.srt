So, David thinks
you're a childhood friend.

I told you guys.
I got really big lungs!

67
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:46,750
I can't believe
you're here, like,

68
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:47,808
last time I saw you,

69
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:49,086
you were coked out
on the subway,

70
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,811
pissing on the floor
like a little hyena.

71
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:52,479
I thought you
were an nyu student.

72
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,048
Oh, my god.

73
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,751
And that is why we do not let
the henny monster out anymore.

74
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:58,719
No, no!

75
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:00,154
Okay, but, seriously,
how are you?

76
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:01,956
I'm good. Yeah.
Yeah?

77
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:04,058
Yeah, i'm, like, really good.
Good. Good.

78

Also, I have to say,

Ooh, spicy, spicy, Jordan.

101
00:07:58,913 --> 00:08:00,715
What is that supposed to mean?

102
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:02,683
Jordan: Just means that
we have all been here

103
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:04,952
and nobody had any fucking
clue that you were coming.

104
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:06,520
Let alone, an hour before

105
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:08,089
the storm is supposed
to start, so...

106
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:11,959
What? I totally
told you guys

107
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:12,994
that I was coming.

108
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:15,029
And I texted you.

109
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,230
In the group chat?
Yeah.

110
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,298
No, you didn't.
Whatever,

111
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:21,202
you guys know that i'm
useless with text, right?

112
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:22,346

Alice: Guys!

119

00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:41,856

Oh! What, uh... what is it?

130
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:58,205

144
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,666
Yeah, don't grab

Where is he?

165
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,747
He's just taking a break.
He'll be back.

166
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:14,849
What does that mean?

167
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:19,353
Is that all you got,
motherfucker!

168
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:27,261
Let's go!

169
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,774
Hey, fuckface!

170
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:41,909
Can we talk for a second?

171
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:44,245
Can you knock?
No, it's my house.

172
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:46,080
Sure. What's up?

173
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:47,948
In private.
Oh!

174
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:49,083
Sure.

175
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:52,052
I'm sorry. He'll learn.

176
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:54,088
I'll be right back.

177
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:56,161
David: Yeah, that's what
Tom Hanks said in <i>castaway.</i>

178
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:58,959
<i>She's actually really cute.</i>

179
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:01,362
In like a school shooter
type of way.

180
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:04,865
"Brought you
zucchini bread, Dave."

181
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,233
She's mine. Hands off.

182
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:25,819
Jordan: Hey.

183
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,957
Oh, hi... I...

184
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,892
Uh, I was just...
No, no, I know.

185
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:35,329
It's beautiful. The house.

186
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,698
Sophie's parents have one
that's even bigger.

187
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,271
Just be careful, okay?

188
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,942
With Sophie. Just...

189
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:52,479
Be careful.

190
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,315
Okay.

191
00:11:56,551 --> 00:11:57,885
Okay.

192
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:09,330
But he's, like, not hot.
You know what I mean?

193
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:10,464
He's like, like, your mom

194
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:11,999
would be like,
"ooh, he's hot."

195
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,335
Not your mom,
I mean moms in general.

196
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:15,236
Moms that have been married

197
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:17,171
for like 10, 15 years
and they see, like,

198
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,839
him going out of a Starbucks...

199
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,075
Alice got to bring someone
without telling anyone.

200
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,042
So you do read the chat.

201
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:24,144
Why is everyone
so obsessed with the chat?

202
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:26,256
Now, you're here. I'm here,
we're here together, right?

203
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,949
Why are we worrying
about the chat?

204
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:30,417
When we can just
live in the moment.

205
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:31,495
Yeah, it's 'cause
you went to rehab

206
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,554
and you're not on drugs.

207
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:33,454
So, like, everything is like,

208
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:36,924
"ooh, why don't
we just all be cool, man?"

209
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,860
You have a little problem
with Greg?

210
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:42,296
The lumberjack.

211
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,364
It's a new pod.

212
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:45,933
I'm not used
to the inhaling yet.

213
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,268
What is he, like, 40?

214
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:48,579
I don't know.
I think Alice found him

215
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:50,204
on tinder, or some shit.

216
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,339
Apparently, he was
in Afghanistan.

217
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:54,942
I think he was in the army,
or some shit, so...

218
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,176
Well, that's hot.

219
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,078
He's not...
He's not, like, that hot.

220
00:12:58,112 --> 00:12:59,356
You don't have to think
he's attractive,

221
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,091
only Alice has to think
that he's attractive.

222
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:02,349
Like, I feel, like,

223
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:04,385
I'm more attractive than that.

224
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:06,920
You do?
Absolutely.

225
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,188
And what are the features

226
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:09,366
that you're bringing
to the table?

227
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,824
Well, I just look like I fuck.

228
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:12,259
You know what I mean?
Mmm.

229
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:14,361
I look like I... I fuck.

230
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:16,497
And that's the vibe
I like to put out there.

231
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:18,332
Yeah.
No, uh, yeah,

232
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,176
he's, he's really
handsome. Whatever.

233
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,978
I mean, we don't have to
talk about it all the time.

234
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,380
What the fuck
happened to your face?

235
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:24,271
Fucking Max.

236
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:27,074
Max did that?
Yes, fucking Max, really.

237
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,184
Okay? I was standing outside

238
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,587
and he just ran up to me
and punched me in the eye.

239
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:30,787
Just ran up to you?
He just did.

240
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,490
Look at it.
He just came up to you
and did that, huh?

241
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:33,890
I think it...
Actually think it looks

242
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,617
kind of dope, though.
Don't you think?

243
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,118
It's getting fucking darker.

244
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:40,421
I look like a,
like a warrior. Right?

245
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:41,998
Like, it's kind of...
It's kind of cool.

246
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,190
Like, it's kind of hot.

247
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,602
Like, if you saw me
coming out of a 7-Eleven,

248
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:46,894
you'd be like...

249
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:49,963
Um...

250
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:52,366
So have you had a chance to, uh,

251
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,934
talk to my parents at all?

252
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,173
What the fuck
are you doing here, soph?

253
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,409
I missed you.

254
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:04,311
We both know that's a lie.

255
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:05,946
Nobody's ever missed me.

256
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,559
Ugh, no! Please, no!

257
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:57,965
Ugh, my god,
can you turn that off?

258
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,333
It's bumming me out.

259
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:02,504
Yeah. You're right.
You're right.

260
00:15:02,537 --> 00:15:05,305
Hey, guys, can I...
Can I get on the Wi-Fi?

261
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,975
Oh, god, I can never
remember the password.

262
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,177
It's, like, an actually
good password.

263
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,930
Jordan: I'll transfer it.
What's your email?

264
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,047
Bee: Uh... what?

265
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,650
What is your email?

266
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,453
Hey...

267
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,457
I'm sorry.
My service went out,

268
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,292
but I am on a Wi-Fi now.

269
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:28,162
So, that's good.

270
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:30,665
Greg: I 100%
wanna do a tiktok.
All of you can do it.

271
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:33,535
Okay. Do you know this?
Which one is it?

272
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:36,179
Greg: I don't know
what I'm doing.

273
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:37,481
Alice: Follow...
We'll watch it...

274
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:39,106
You'll catch it. Yeah.

275
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:42,176
Okay, ready, three, two...

276
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,211
Emma: Keep up, keep up.

277
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:45,713
Jordan: Go!
Emma: Look at you.

278
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:50,785
Are we at the last part?

279
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:52,754
Jordan: That was good.
That was good.
Okay.

280
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:55,322
Greg went a little rogue
but we're checking the moves.

281
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,458
Alice: No, you didn't.
Again, again, again.

282
00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:58,769
Emma: At the end
you go like this.

283
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:00,595
Alice: Ready? Get ready.
You okay?

284
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:02,530
Jordan: We should just,
just post it.

285
00:16:02,564 --> 00:16:03,497
Alice: It's very good.

286
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:05,175
Jordan: I'm ready for
the flow. One more time!

287
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,300
Three, two, one, go!

288
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,602
Do you want a drink?

289
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:08,703
Do you want something?

290
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:10,270
Here you go. There we go!

291
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:13,140
She's having a good time.

292
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,241
Let's go!

293
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:16,644
Yeah! Oh, my god.

294
00:16:16,678 --> 00:16:18,111
Okay, bitch.

295
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:20,748
Alice: I make it very salty.

296
00:16:20,782 --> 00:16:22,216
It's incredibly salty.

297
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,285
Emma: Is this your
first relationship?

298
00:16:27,555 --> 00:16:29,423
Uh, no.

299
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,425
You just, kind of,
give that vibe.

300
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,562
Not in a bad way.
Bee: Yeah.

301
00:16:34,596 --> 00:16:36,263
How long have
you guys been together?

302
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,265
Oh, uh, six weeks.

303
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,367
Nice.
Wow.

304
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,236
Six weeks with Sophie.

305
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,506
Alice.
In a good way, that's good.

306
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:46,173
Are you from Moscow?

307
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,075
Bee: No.
Oh.

308
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,209
Bee: Why?

309
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:52,045
<i>Doctor Zhivago</i>
is my favorite film.

310
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,480
Alice: Ugh, my god,

311
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:55,048
what is going on
with this storm?

312
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:56,818
I'm, like, make up your mind.

313
00:16:56,851 --> 00:16:59,052
I want it to start,
like, pouring again

314
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:02,055
so that we can go fucking crazy.

315
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:05,325
Oh, you know that has
weed in it, right?

316
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,361
Not a lot,
I just wanted to let you know.

317
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:09,363
Just didn't want you
to go to town and then...

318
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:10,956
Emma: Yeah.
Alice: You know what I mean?

319
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:15,369
Ooh, we're getting
a lot of likes.

320
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:16,571
All: <i>♪ I'm smart</i>

321
00:17:16,604 --> 00:17:17,672
<i>♪ I'm strong</i>

322
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:19,807
<i>♪ I'm ready for
whatever comes along!</i>

323
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:22,209

00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:27,300
Who wants to play
bodies bodies bodies?

387
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,737
David: Ah, fuck!
Emma: Yes!

388
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:31,806
Sophie: So, if you draw
the piece of paper

389
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,473
that has the "x" on it,

390
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:35,475
you are the murderer.

391
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,310
And you have
to keep it a secret.

392
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,947
Guys, I get so stressed out
every time we play this.

393
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:41,348
Someone always ends up crying.

394
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:42,717
Alice: You always
end up crying.

395
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,653
Okay, I can access
my emotions easily.

396
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:47,421
Alice: Very incredibly easily.

397
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:49,322
She's an actress,
she always cries first.

398
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:53,528
I'm just saying,
this game gets very ugly.

399
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:55,228
Oh, my god, no, it does not.

400
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:57,632
It gets ugly
when she ugly cries.

401
00:19:57,665 --> 00:19:59,634
Emma: Literally, every single
time we play,

402
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:00,668
people start fighting.

403
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:02,737
David: Yeah, well, that's
what makes it fun, Emma.

404
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:08,743
Where's Max?

405
00:20:08,776 --> 00:20:10,477
He's not responding to my texts.

406
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:11,746
Oh, Jesus...

407
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:20,021
So, how do you play?

408
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:22,924
Sophie: So, I'm gonna
hit the lights in a second.

409
00:20:22,957 --> 00:20:24,559
And if you are the murderer,

410
00:20:24,592 --> 00:20:26,994
you have to sneak around
and kill someone

411
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:29,362
by, like, touching them
on the back.

412
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:32,967
And then, everyone else
has to avoid being killed.

413
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,836
And then, if you are killed,

414
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:38,039
you have to fall down
and pretend you're dead.

415
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:39,607
Alice: Like this.

416
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,676
Greg: Cool.

417
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:43,678
Hey, uh...
Alice, do you wanna...

418
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:45,747
What?
David: Do you wanna...

419
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,248
You know.
Oh! Excuse me, I have to go.

420
00:20:48,683 --> 00:20:49,951
It's an emergency.

421
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:52,587
Excuse me.

422
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,764
Jordan: The most
important part

423
00:20:53,788 --> 00:20:55,757
is if you do come across a body,

424
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,725
you have to yell,
"bodies, bodies, bodies."

425
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:58,960
And then, once that happens,

426
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:00,327
we'll turn all
the lights back on

427
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,663
and then we'll try
to figure out who did it.

428
00:21:02,697 --> 00:21:03,998
Could you hold this?

429
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:05,600
Did Greg touch that?

430
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:06,667
Oh, my god.

431
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:08,603
You're being such a dick
about Greg.

432
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:10,037
Just hold this.

433
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:13,340
David...

434
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,942
What?
I, ugh...

435
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:21,783
Okay...

436
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:25,520
Look, what the fuck's going on?

437
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:26,954
Sophie: Come to the floor.

438
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:28,022
Come to the floor.

439
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:30,024
Jordan: Get your ass
over here, boy.

440
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:34,427
Sophie: Okay.
All right.

441
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:35,663
Jordan:
Who will do the honors?

442
00:21:36,531 --> 00:21:37,865
Oh...

443
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:40,300
Get into it. Let's go.

444
00:21:41,068 --> 00:21:42,402
Jordan: Ow!

445
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,939
Ahhh!

446
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,841
Bitch.

447
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:47,909
Alice: Are you mad at me?

448
00:21:47,942 --> 00:21:49,222
Jordan: No.
Alice: Okay.

449
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:52,379
Bee: Ow!
Alice: Jordan!

450
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:53,748
Sophie: Whoa.
What? It's the game.

451
00:21:53,781 --> 00:21:55,016
David: Wowza...

452
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,136
Oh, my god...
Oh, come on!

453
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:16,403
What was that?
Bee!

454
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:17,446
You have to hit more.
You got to put

455
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,507
some muscle into it.
You gotta...
Yeah, go for it.

456
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,541
Yeah.

457
00:22:22,076 --> 00:22:23,410
Come on!

458
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:24,521
Jordan: Slap him around,
he deserves it.

459
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:25,513
David: Fucking hit me!

460
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:27,615
Emma: He wants it.
Jordan: No, he deserves it.

461
00:22:27,648 --> 00:22:28,583
He really deserves it. Do it.

462
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:29,993
If anyone deserves
to be hit, it should be him.

463
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:31,853
Yeah.
Bee: Okay.

464
00:22:31,886 --> 00:22:33,554
Oh, for fuck sake like this.

465
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:35,122
Alice: Oh, my god!

466
00:22:35,156 --> 00:22:36,991
Jordan: David!
David.

467
00:22:38,593 --> 00:22:39,894
See?
David.

468
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:43,598
You're a fucking dick!

469
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:45,099
What?

470
00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:46,834
You are such an asshole.

471
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:48,011
I'm teaching her
how to play the game.

472
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:49,469
Alice: Baby, stop, stop!

473
00:22:49,503 --> 00:22:51,505
Wait, guys,
someone has to hit me.

474
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,074
Who's gonna hit me?

475
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:54,374
Jordan: I'll do it.

476
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:57,477
Emma: Ow!

477
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,413
Thank you.
Jordan: You're welcome.

478
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:01,448
Sophie: Okay!

479
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,483
Are we ready to go?
Alice: Yes, let's fucking go.

480
00:23:03,517 --> 00:23:05,037
David: Yes.
Alice: Let's play the game.

481
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:17,798
David: Holy shit!
I'm so fucked up.

482
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:42,924
Ahh.

483
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:48,663
You ready?

484
00:23:48,863 --> 00:23:50,031
Yes.

485
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,808
Bee: Hey.

486
00:25:04,205 --> 00:25:05,906
Oh!

487
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:21,689
Sophie: I see white man...

488
00:25:21,722 --> 00:25:23,290
Bodies, bodies, bodies!

489
00:25:26,227 --> 00:25:30,264
You guys! Over here.

490
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:35,069
No!

491
00:25:35,102 --> 00:25:36,904
Jordan: All right,
who tried to take advantage

492
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:38,739
of my body in the dark?

493
00:25:38,773 --> 00:25:40,207
Your wish, babe.

494
00:25:40,241 --> 00:25:43,978
Alice: Oh, why, god?
Why? He was so hot!

495
00:25:44,945 --> 00:25:46,881
Was it you?
No.

496
00:25:46,914 --> 00:25:49,750
Okay. So, do we have
any nominations?

497
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:51,252
David: Emma
whoa.

498
00:25:51,285 --> 00:25:53,254
Wow, coming in hot.
What?

499
00:25:53,287 --> 00:25:55,890
Why?
Yup, I think it was Emma.

500
00:25:55,923 --> 00:25:57,691
Why do you think it was me?

501
00:25:57,725 --> 00:25:58,893
Alice: Yeah, David, why?

502
00:25:58,926 --> 00:26:00,361
David: Okay, well,
she just, like,

503
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:03,097
agrees with everything
that everybody is saying.

504
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,299
And that's her strategy
in this game

505
00:26:05,332 --> 00:26:07,001
and it works every single time.

506
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:08,669
So, I'm just calling it now.
It's Emma.

507
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:10,638
Sophie: Do we have
any other nominations?

508
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:12,807
Um... yeah, David.

509
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,351
David: Oh, come on.
It's low hanging fruit.

510
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:16,077
I mean, he who casts
the first stone.

511
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,845
Bee: Guys,
why isn't he moving?

512
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,183
Greg?
Baby, get up.

513
00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:24,985
You don't have to keep
pretending for this long.

514
00:26:25,886 --> 00:26:27,621
Baby?
Come on, Greg.

515
00:26:27,655 --> 00:26:28,656
Alice: Greg...

516
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,191
Greg...

517
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:32,226
Get up.

518
00:26:33,094 --> 00:26:34,161
Wait.

519
00:26:38,132 --> 00:26:39,166
Greg?

520
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:41,902
Greg!

521
00:26:41,936 --> 00:26:43,404
Greg, get up!

522
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:44,839
Greg! He's not getting up.

523
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:47,208
Hey, relax,
this always works. I know.

524
00:26:47,241 --> 00:26:49,844
Oh, hey!
Oh, my god.

525
00:26:49,877 --> 00:26:52,847
You really scared me with that.

526
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:55,950
Emma: You're a little
trickster, Greg.

527
00:26:55,983 --> 00:26:57,651
Jordan: I know, Jesus Christ.

528
00:26:57,685 --> 00:26:59,720
Sophie: Cute.

529
00:26:59,753 --> 00:27:02,423
Okay, so... what about David?

530
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:03,724
Alice:

531
00:27:03,757 --> 00:27:05,226
Wait, maybe it's Jordan.

532
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:07,337
She's always really aggressive
when she's the killer.

533
00:27:07,361 --> 00:27:08,729
There you go.
What? No, I am not.

534
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:09,730
You're lying.

535
00:27:09,763 --> 00:27:11,732
Your voice always goes
really high when you lie.

536
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:13,734
No, it doesn't.
I... it... I've...

537
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:15,803
It's definitely David.
Why are you yelling?

538
00:27:15,836 --> 00:27:17,013
That would be so fucking obvious

539
00:27:17,037 --> 00:27:18,839
if I were the killer,
which I'm not.

540
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:19,983
I think you're digging yourself

541
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:21,442
into a little hole here, Dave.

542
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:24,078
David: Guys, Jesus Christ...

543
00:27:24,111 --> 00:27:25,946
The best defense
is a good offense.

544
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,257
Hey, you shut up. You're not
supposed to talk. You're dead.

545
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:28,358
The dead are actually
not supposed to speak.

546
00:27:28,382 --> 00:27:30,160
Oh, yeah, you... sorry, baby,
you can't. It's a rule.

547
00:27:30,184 --> 00:27:32,219
Oh, my b.
Yeah, no talking. Pack it up.

548
00:27:32,253 --> 00:27:34,093
David: What the fuck
does that even mean, Greg?

549
00:27:34,121 --> 00:27:35,756
What's up?

550
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:37,791
"The best defense
is a good offense."

551
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:39,793
What does that...
What does that mean?

552
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:43,030
Oh, you know,
the best defense
is a good offense.

553
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:48,169
What...
What does it mean, though?

554
00:27:50,204 --> 00:27:51,972
Uh, well...

555
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:55,276
It, um... it means
that the best defense

556
00:27:56,377 --> 00:27:58,045
is a good offense.

557
00:27:58,078 --> 00:28:00,114
Right, right, I heard you.

558
00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:03,450
But, what does it mean
to you, Greg? Like...

559
00:28:03,484 --> 00:28:06,287
I don't know, could you
elaborate on it for us?

560
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,821
Break it down.

561
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:09,323
Yeah, sure.

562
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:11,792
So, hey, look in sports,
there's...

563
00:28:13,127 --> 00:28:14,161
Oh, my god.

564
00:28:14,195 --> 00:28:15,796
You are such a fucking dick.

565
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:17,198
Hey, this is a teaching moment.

566
00:28:21,135 --> 00:28:22,203
Oh, I see.

567
00:28:23,304 --> 00:28:24,471
You're fucking with me.

568
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:26,440
No. No,

569
00:28:26,473 --> 00:28:27,908
I'm not fucking with you, Greg.

570
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:30,144
I'm just having fun.

571
00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:32,379
We're all just
having a good time.

572
00:28:32,413 --> 00:28:33,781
Right, guys?

573
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:35,716
Right, Greg?

574
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:46,427
We're just having fun.

575
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:00,407
You know,

576
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:02,876
I think it's time for me
to put myself to bed.

577
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,879
Jordan: Oh, come on, Greg.
Alice: Greg, no.

578
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:07,248
Good night, Greg.

579
00:29:07,948 --> 00:29:09,083
You kids have fun.

580
00:29:09,116 --> 00:29:10,784
Sophie: Catch you later,
player.

581
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:11,919
David: By the way,

582
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:13,821
can I just point
all of our attention

583
00:29:13,854 --> 00:29:16,223
to the fact that Emma
hasn't said a fucking word.

584
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:19,460
Alice: Whoa, you're right.

585
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:20,528
Whoa, she hasn't!

586
00:29:20,562 --> 00:29:23,063
David: I'm just pointing out
the obvious. That's all.

587
00:29:23,097 --> 00:29:24,865
Look, she's doing
that swallowing thing.

588
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:26,309
She always does that
when she's fucking nervous!

589
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:27,344
Alice: Oh, my god!
Look, look!

590
00:29:27,368 --> 00:29:29,870
Oh, my god, you're doing it.
You're swallowing it.

591
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:31,839
I'm not.
Alice: You are.

592
00:29:31,872 --> 00:29:33,508
Okay, I love you,
but when you swallow,

593
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:35,009
it's just fucking...
Like, why?

594
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:36,243
Swallowing is normal.

595
00:29:36,277 --> 00:29:37,387
It's a normal thing to do.
David: Yeah...

596
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:39,322
It's very UN-attractive.
I don't know why you do it?

597
00:29:39,346 --> 00:29:42,816
Oh, my god. Is that why
you guys never have sex?

598
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,952
What?
Alice.

599
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:49,089
What? It's not a bad thing.
Some people have sex a lot.

600
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:50,057
Some people have it less.

601
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,960
Alice, what are you
talking about? We do.

602
00:29:52,993 --> 00:29:54,895
I have it a lot. Some...

603
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:56,206
Are you fucking...
Sophie: Oh, my god.

604
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,110
Are you fucking talking
about us behind my back?

605
00:29:59,033 --> 00:30:00,568
No.
Yes.

606
00:30:00,602 --> 00:30:01,902
Emma: No.
Yes.

607
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,004
No, I'm not.

608
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:05,239
I'm not! I'm not.

609
00:30:05,272 --> 00:30:06,283
I just...
David: That's just great.

610
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:09,943
Emma: No, I... we...
I... you never really... I...

611
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:11,879
I don't...
You're always gaslighting me.

612
00:30:11,912 --> 00:30:13,524
"Gaslight," shut up.
It's a fucking dumb word.

613
00:30:13,548 --> 00:30:14,716
Excuse me?

614
00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:17,351
Gaslight is, like, one of
the most over used words ever,

615
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:19,587
to, like, the point
of annihilation.

616
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:22,022
Okay, it doesn't mean
anything other than the fact

617
00:30:22,056 --> 00:30:23,525
that, like,
you read the Internet.

618
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:26,026
Or, like, "congrats,
you have a Twitter account."

619
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,195
Ugh, that is so fucking lame.

620
00:30:28,228 --> 00:30:29,306
David: "Gaslight,"
get over it.

621
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:32,132
Like what's next?
You're gonna call me
a narcissist?

622
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,968
Or a foot soldier of,
like, the white supremacy?

623
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:37,004
Like, come on, fucking,
be more original.

624
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:38,272
Sophie: Lame.

625
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:39,316
David: What? I'm just saying,
that, this is what I'm saying,

626
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,084
she doesn't have a thought
in her fucking head

627
00:30:41,108 --> 00:30:43,911
that hasn't been said
by anybody else.

628
00:30:43,944 --> 00:30:45,580
Nothing that isn't preordained.

629
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:49,149
Alice: David,
that's really mean.

630
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:50,884
Look, she's crying.

631
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:52,086
David: What?

632
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,296
Why is everybody
looking at me like that?

633
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,255
This is not her real cry.

634
00:30:57,424 --> 00:30:58,425
I vote David.

635
00:30:59,393 --> 00:31:00,928
Yeah, me too.

636
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:02,630
Are you fucking serious?

637
00:31:02,664 --> 00:31:03,964
Guys, it's Emma.

638
00:31:03,997 --> 00:31:06,501
She's an actress.
She's acting.

639
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:08,302
Third.

640
00:31:08,335 --> 00:31:10,237
David: Wow,
how fucking surprising.

641
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,206
Yeah, look at your
quivering upper lip.

642
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:14,375
Like, we all didn't see you
in <i>hedda gabler.</i> Fuck you.

643
00:31:14,408 --> 00:31:16,176
Yeah, yeah, yup... fourth.

644
00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:20,615
Oh, my god.

645
00:31:20,648 --> 00:31:22,015
Fuck this game!

646
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:27,054
Alice: Holy shit.

647
00:31:29,022 --> 00:31:31,392
Relationships can
be really complicated.

648
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:36,196
Are you okay?

649
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,599
I'm fine.
Are you sure?

650
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:40,134
I'm fine. I'm 100% fine.
Are you sure, baby?

651
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,636
Yes. Let's play.

652
00:31:42,403 --> 00:31:43,538
Ow!

653
00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:46,206
Alice: Wow, good one.

654
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,176
Jordan: All of a sudden
she loves the game.

655
00:31:49,209 --> 00:31:51,378
Alice: That was crazy.

656
00:31:53,715 --> 00:31:54,915
Give it to me.

657
00:31:57,217 --> 00:31:58,318
Jordan: Damn!

658
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,589
Alice: Ah! Oh, my god!

659
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:02,657
Emma: What was that?

660
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,434
Alice: What the fuck?
Jordan: Is that the lights?

661
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:05,492
Emma: What was that?

662
00:32:05,527 --> 00:32:06,493
Sophie: Oh, my god.
Emma: Was that from the storm?

663
00:32:06,528 --> 00:32:08,530
Sophie: Oh, my god.
I bet you that it was David.

664
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:10,264
David!
Jordan: It's not David.
Come on.

665
00:32:10,297 --> 00:32:11,331
I'm texting him.

666
00:32:11,365 --> 00:32:13,233
David, are you fucking with us?

667
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:14,736
Turn the lights back on.

668
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:16,538
Hey, does anybody have service?

669
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:17,639
No!

670
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:19,306
Ugh, wait, mine's not working.

671
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:21,141
Okay, I think
the WiFi is also down.

672
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:23,444
Oh, my god, i'm
gonna fucking kill him.

673
00:32:23,477 --> 00:32:26,079
Great!
David!

674
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:28,516
David! This is
real fucking cute!

675
00:32:31,452 --> 00:32:33,597
Jordan: Soph, can he disable
the generator from garage,

676
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:35,523
or the basement, or whatever?

677
00:32:35,557 --> 00:32:37,559
I don't know.

678
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,094
David!

679
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:44,264
Okay, well, I'm gonna
go and flip the breaker.

680
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:46,009
Is it in the garage
or is it in the basement?

681
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:47,234
David!
Jordan: Soph?

682
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:48,479
Huh, what?
Jordan: Okay, whatever.

683
00:32:48,503 --> 00:32:50,505
Okay, I'm gonna go
get some more flashlights.

684
00:32:50,538 --> 00:32:52,272
Emma: I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

685
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:53,307
Where is a bathroom?

686
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,410
Um, uh, downstairs,
first door on your right.

687
00:32:57,244 --> 00:32:58,345
Bee: Going there.

688
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:04,485
Sophie: David?

689
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:11,124
David, are you fucking with us?

690
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,790
I meant the other stairs.

691
00:34:21,763 --> 00:34:23,831
David! David!

692
00:34:26,768 --> 00:34:29,403
Help! Somebody help!

693
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:31,839
No, no, no.

694
00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:33,641
Alice: What the fuck happened?

695
00:34:33,675 --> 00:34:36,410
Oh, my god! Why would...

696
00:34:36,443 --> 00:34:38,813
Jordan: Check his pulse.
Sophie: What the fuck?

697
00:34:38,846 --> 00:34:40,748
Jordan: Oh, fuck!
Oh, my god!

698
00:34:40,782 --> 00:34:41,849
Hold his head up!

699
00:34:42,684 --> 00:34:44,552
Oh, my god!
Fuck!

700
00:34:44,586 --> 00:34:46,888
Fuck!
Alice: Is he dying?

701
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:49,323
Hold his head up!
Emma: Come on, baby, hold on.

702
00:34:49,356 --> 00:34:50,868
Sophie: What the fuck
happened to his neck?

703
00:34:50,892 --> 00:34:52,560
I love you, David.
Shit.

704
00:34:52,594 --> 00:34:54,529
Alice: What is happening?

705
00:34:56,229 --> 00:34:57,799
Shit!

706
00:34:57,832 --> 00:34:59,534
Alice: What are you doing?
I'm calling 911!

707
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:00,735
Oh, my god! You have service?

708
00:35:00,768 --> 00:35:02,269
Fuck, no! Do you?

709
00:35:02,302 --> 00:35:03,470
No!
Jordan: Shit!

710
00:35:03,504 --> 00:35:05,305
Where are you going?
Landline!

711
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:06,774
We should move his body?

712
00:35:06,808 --> 00:35:09,242
Why?
I don't know. Because he's...

713
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:10,477
Alice: No, you can't move him.

714
00:35:10,511 --> 00:35:12,279
Did you watch <i>svu?</i>
It's evidence.

715
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:15,349
Of what?
Alice: Cause!

716
00:35:15,382 --> 00:35:17,317
Landline?
No, there's no connection.

717
00:35:17,351 --> 00:35:19,152
Sophie, where are your keys?

718
00:35:19,186 --> 00:35:20,521
Your keys, Sophie,
where are they?

719
00:35:20,555 --> 00:35:21,488
They're in the pocket.

720
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:23,357
They're in her pocket...
Where? Fucking help!

721
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,358
Alice: Where are you going?

722
00:35:24,391 --> 00:35:26,694
I'm going to the car.
Alice: To the car? Why?

723
00:35:26,728 --> 00:35:28,295
To get some fucking help.

724
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:29,697
Wait, do you have a license?

725
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:31,164
Doesn't she not have a license?

726
00:35:31,198 --> 00:35:32,700
I don't know.
I don't think so.

727
00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:34,569
Alice: Fuck!
Bee: He's dead!

728
00:35:34,602 --> 00:35:36,336
You have to go!
I don't know!

729
00:35:36,904 --> 00:35:38,640
He stopped breathing!

730
00:36:02,563 --> 00:36:03,698
Jordan: Branch!

731
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:27,622
Alice: You have
to push the gas.

732
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:29,757
Jordan: I know how
to fucking drive, Alice!

733
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:31,626
I can't see.
Jordan: Is the battery dead?

734
00:36:32,794 --> 00:36:35,228
Bee: Oh, no...
Jordan: What?

735
00:36:35,262 --> 00:36:37,665
I, I think I left the light on,
on the mirror.

736
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:40,467
Alice: Oh, Jesus Christ.

737
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:42,269
Emma: What the fuck
are we supposed to do?

738
00:36:42,302 --> 00:36:43,805
Bee: Wait,
where are your cars?

739
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:45,540
Alice: We...
We only have one car.

740
00:36:45,573 --> 00:36:48,275
Max picked us all up
and he fucking left!

741
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:51,713
Jordan: Fuck, fuck, fuck!

742
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:05,325
Max will probably
be here any minute, right?

743
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:06,460
Where's Jordan?

744
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:09,797
She went to check
the generator, I...

745
00:37:10,698 --> 00:37:12,900
What the fuck was he doing?

746
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:14,978
What are you talking about?
Sophie: Fuck was he doing?

747
00:37:15,002 --> 00:37:17,605
Why the fuck was he
outside in the storm?

748
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,716
Jordan: Hey!
It's me, let me in!

749
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:37,892
I found this.

750
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,628
Outside in the mud.

751
00:37:47,835 --> 00:37:48,936
Sophie: Don't touch it

752
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:51,739
um, does the security system
work if the power goes out?

753
00:37:51,773 --> 00:37:53,473
Um...

754
00:37:53,508 --> 00:37:55,977
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it does.

755
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,477
David's dad explained it to us.

756
00:37:57,512 --> 00:37:58,622
Nobody can get in
without the code.

757
00:37:58,646 --> 00:37:59,814
Well, Max has the code.

758
00:38:00,615 --> 00:38:01,816
So...
Max wouldn't...

759
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:04,852
I'm just saying, like,
where the fuck is he?

760
00:38:04,886 --> 00:38:06,721
Couldn't he have come back
after last night?

761
00:38:06,754 --> 00:38:08,321
Alice, stop.

762
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:12,860
What happened last night?

763
00:38:12,894 --> 00:38:14,461
Nothing.
Alice: No.

764
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:15,963
We did shrooms

765
00:38:15,997 --> 00:38:19,466
and Max told everybody
that he was in love with Emma.

766
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:21,769
Which David thought
was beautiful in the moment,

767
00:38:21,803 --> 00:38:23,504
but maybe not today.

768
00:38:23,538 --> 00:38:25,640
Alice, that literally doesn't
fucking matter at all.

769
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:28,341
Where is Greg? Where is he?

770
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,911
What?
Jordan: Where is Greg?

771
00:38:29,944 --> 00:38:30,978
I...

772
00:38:31,012 --> 00:38:32,647
He said he was going to bed.

773
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,381
So my guess would be
that he's sleeping.

774
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:35,759
Okay, don't you think
it's a little bit strange

775
00:38:35,783 --> 00:38:37,652
that he hasn't, like,
woken up yet?

776
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:39,319
Jordan,

777
00:38:40,054 --> 00:38:41,789
what are you trying to say.

778
00:38:41,823 --> 00:38:43,390
Maybe we should
just go check on him.

779
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:44,659
Alice: No, no, no.

780
00:38:47,695 --> 00:38:48,830
Jordan...

781
00:38:48,863 --> 00:38:51,599
What are you doing?
Jordan... Jordan.

782
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:52,767
What are you doing!

783
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,101
I'm staying safe.
Alice: Really?

784
00:38:54,135 --> 00:38:55,212
Because it looks like
you're grabbing

785
00:38:55,236 --> 00:38:57,505
a fucking meat cleaver
to go look for my boyfriend!

786
00:38:57,538 --> 00:38:59,106
Wow. Boyfriend?

787
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,584
That's the first time
I've heard you call him that.

788
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,642
That's crazy.

789
00:39:01,676 --> 00:39:02,820
Alice: Don't be such a bitch.

790
00:39:02,844 --> 00:39:05,022
Jordan: Alice, I'm literally
just protecting myself, okay?

791
00:39:05,046 --> 00:39:07,815
Let me remind you,
our friend is dead.

792
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:10,127
So, if you could just, like,
not escalate the situation...

793
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:11,953
I'm not escalating.
You're holding the knife

794
00:39:11,986 --> 00:39:13,497
and you're moving your hands
while you talk.

795
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:15,323
Alice, how long
have you known Greg?

796
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:18,458
Like...

797
00:39:20,728 --> 00:39:21,829
Long.

798
00:39:22,797 --> 00:39:23,831
Alice.

799
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:25,833
Ugh...

800
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:29,103
I don't know exactly how long.

801
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:30,638
I... Like...

802
00:39:31,606 --> 00:39:32,640
Two weeks.

803
00:39:32,673 --> 00:39:33,808
Jordan: Okay, uh...

804
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:35,408
What do you know
about Greg, Alice?

805
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:36,476
Oh, my god.

806
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,621
Jordan: What do you
know about him?

807
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:38,880
Oh, my god, guys!

808
00:39:38,913 --> 00:39:39,990
Sophie: Oh, my god!
Relax. Stop!

809
00:39:40,014 --> 00:39:42,550
Stop! Stop! I know that
he's a good person, okay?

810
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:44,085
He's fundamentally
a good person.

811
00:39:44,118 --> 00:39:45,653
He wouldn't do this. Like, no.

812
00:39:45,686 --> 00:39:47,664
Do you know his middle name?
Do you know where he lives?

813
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:49,523
Do you know how much
fucking money he makes?

814
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:51,192
Do you know
his last name, Alice?

815
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:52,693
I know a lot.

816
00:39:52,727 --> 00:39:55,062
Our first date was at...
Was at a bar.

817
00:39:55,096 --> 00:39:56,864
He drank, like,
a medium amount...

818
00:39:56,898 --> 00:39:58,008
Jordan: Okay, Alice... stop.
He likes nature.

819
00:39:58,032 --> 00:39:59,000
Jordan: What is his
middle name?

820
00:39:59,033 --> 00:39:59,934
He's a libra moon.
Jordan: Where does he live?

821
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:01,011
You don't ask
what your middle name is!

822
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:03,938
Okay? For a really long time.
Jordan: Oh... fuck!

823
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:07,508
He's a libra moon.
That says a lot!

824
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:08,709
Fuck!

825
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:14,081
Greg!
Shh!

826
00:40:14,115 --> 00:40:15,726
Alice: What? You just said
we're looking for Greg!

827
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,827
Okay, well
don't fucking, Alice...

828
00:40:16,851 --> 00:40:17,995
Greg! Can you come
into the kitchen?

829
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:19,086
We need you for a second.

830
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,155
Shut up.
Stop waving the knife at me!

831
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:22,523
Fuck.
You're making me...

832
00:40:22,556 --> 00:40:24,058
Stop. Stop. Greg!

833
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:25,559
Stop. Just stop.
Just be quiet.

834
00:40:25,593 --> 00:40:26,627
Stop. Stop.

835
00:40:26,661 --> 00:40:28,495
Greg! Don't.
Relax.

836
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:30,965
Don't grab my mouth.
Relax. Relax. Relax.

837
00:40:30,998 --> 00:40:32,667
You're silencing me.
Oh, my god.

838
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,467
Get the fuck off.
Okay, stop.

839
00:40:34,502 --> 00:40:36,137
Alice: Don't grab me
like that again.

840
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,004
And she came at me with a knife.

841
00:40:37,038 --> 00:40:39,006
Jordan: I'm sorry...
Alice: Back off.

842
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,141
Okay, buck!

843
00:40:41,676 --> 00:40:42,743
Wait, where's Emma?

844
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:43,811
Oh, my god.

845
00:40:58,793 --> 00:40:59,994
Jordan: Emma?

846
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,565
Emma?

847
00:41:04,598 --> 00:41:05,933
Guys,

848
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:07,768
maybe Emma could have done it.

849
00:41:07,802 --> 00:41:08,912
She was really pissed at David.

850
00:41:08,936 --> 00:41:10,013
Sophie: Alice, what the fuck?

851
00:41:10,037 --> 00:41:11,081
Sophie: Emma wouldn't do that.

852
00:41:11,105 --> 00:41:12,006
She was devastated.

853
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:14,041
She's having, like,
a full-on panic attack.

854
00:41:14,075 --> 00:41:15,676
Yeah, but she's an actress.

855
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,611
She's acting.
Remember <i>hedda gabler?</i>

856
00:41:17,645 --> 00:41:18,579
Okay, not to be mean,

857
00:41:18,612 --> 00:41:20,614
but she wasn't that good
in <i>hedda gabler.</i>

858
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:39,166
This is my room.

859
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,568
So open it.

860
00:41:41,669 --> 00:41:42,670
You open it.

861
00:41:42,703 --> 00:41:44,772
What happened to,
"Greg would never do this?"

862
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:46,741
He wouldn't.
Okay, so open it.

863
00:41:46,774 --> 00:41:48,175
I will in one second.

864
00:41:48,976 --> 00:41:50,077
I'm going to.

865
00:42:00,721 --> 00:42:01,989
Sophie: He's not here.

866
00:42:04,658 --> 00:42:06,627
Soph, are there any guns
in the house?

867
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,695
Guns?

868
00:42:08,262 --> 00:42:09,397
No. No way.

869
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,832
David's dad can be a dick,
but his politics check out.

870
00:42:24,812 --> 00:42:25,946
Jordan: Guys...

871
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:33,087
What the fuck is this?

872
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,259
Uh... but...

873
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:41,629
He wanted to be prepared
for the hurricane. He...

874
00:42:45,132 --> 00:42:46,309
Sophie: Why did he circle
the fucking house

875
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:47,768
on his fucking map?

876
00:42:47,802 --> 00:42:49,522
Jordan: We have to
find Emma before he does.

877
00:42:49,703 --> 00:42:50,805
Sophie: Okay.

878
00:42:54,909 --> 00:42:56,243
Jordan: Let's check
my room next.

879
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:32,179
Jordan: I don't think
he's hiding in my bra.

880
00:43:34,915 --> 00:43:36,083
Alice: Guys...

881
00:43:36,117 --> 00:43:37,318
Come here.

882
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:54,235
Oh, my god, Emma.

883
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,671
Emma.

884
00:43:57,705 --> 00:43:58,873
Are you okay?

885
00:43:58,906 --> 00:44:00,717
Emma: What's going on?
What are you guys doing?

886
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:02,042
You scared me what's happening?

887
00:44:03,177 --> 00:44:04,345
It's so hot in here.

888
00:44:06,447 --> 00:44:07,381
What is that?

889
00:44:07,414 --> 00:44:09,350
Xanax. Do you want one?
Yeah, give me one.

890
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:12,920
You want one?
Sophie: No.

891
00:44:12,953 --> 00:44:14,321
Jordan: Hey, you take this.

892
00:44:14,355 --> 00:44:16,857
Why?
Jordan: I'm gonna find Greg.

893
00:44:16,891 --> 00:44:19,260
Greg, why? Where's Max?

894
00:44:19,293 --> 00:44:21,996
Maybe Max did it.
Maybe he is here.

895
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:23,297
Max was really angry at David.

896
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:24,374
I'm serious,
he looked like he was gonna

897
00:44:24,398 --> 00:44:25,299
do something really fucked up.

898
00:44:25,332 --> 00:44:26,967
Jordan: Alice! Shut up.
I'm just saying.

899
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:28,269
Max would never.

900
00:44:28,302 --> 00:44:29,970
Let's go find Greg.

901
00:44:30,371 --> 00:44:31,372
Okay.

902
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:54,929
Jordan: What the...

903
00:44:57,031 --> 00:44:59,200
What the fuck?
Alice: Oh, my god.

904
00:45:01,101 --> 00:45:03,037
Sophie: What the hell
is on his face?

905
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,873
It's his light therapy mask.
He has seasonal depression.

906
00:45:08,008 --> 00:45:09,109
Jordan: Let's go.

907
00:45:22,423 --> 00:45:23,791
Hey... shh...

908
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:38,806
Alice: Greg.

909
00:45:46,013 --> 00:45:48,148
What's up?
Jordan: Where have you been?

910
00:45:48,182 --> 00:45:49,350
Huh?

911
00:45:49,383 --> 00:45:50,451
Where have you been?

912
00:45:51,285 --> 00:45:53,287
Oh, I, uh...

913
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,455
I couldn't sleep,

914
00:45:54,488 --> 00:45:57,024
so I came down here
to do my exercises.

915
00:45:57,057 --> 00:45:58,297
Alice: Why didn't
you answer me?

916
00:45:58,325 --> 00:45:59,493
Were you calling for me?

917
00:45:59,527 --> 00:46:00,894
Alice: Yeah.

918
00:46:00,928 --> 00:46:02,930
I... I had my headphones in.

919
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:09,870
Are you guys
still playing werewolf?

920
00:46:14,408 --> 00:46:15,943
Alice: Greg!

921
00:46:15,976 --> 00:46:17,378
Stop! Stop it!

922
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:23,585
All right.

923
00:46:23,618 --> 00:46:25,419
What am I supposed to do, huh?

924
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:26,987
Why don't you tell us,
fucking Greg?

925
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:29,256
Greg: Is that my go bag?
Is that a knife?

926
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,592
Why did you bring a go bag?

927
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:32,960
The hurricane?
See, I told you.

928
00:46:32,993 --> 00:46:34,170
Sophie: Why did you circle
the fucking house

929
00:46:34,194 --> 00:46:35,262
on your fucking map?

930
00:46:37,031 --> 00:46:38,566
What's going on?
David is dead.

931
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,134
His body is outside.

932
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:41,468
David's body. Wait, what?

933
00:46:41,503 --> 00:46:42,970
Why did you kill David?

934
00:46:43,003 --> 00:46:44,606
You murdered my boyfriend.

935
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:48,442
No, no. David killed me.
Right?

936
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:50,277
Jordan: This isn't
a joke, Greg.

937
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:52,614
David is dead.
Somebody slit his throat.

938
00:46:52,647 --> 00:46:54,448
What?
Sophie: With a fucking sword,

939
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:56,116
you fucking sick fuck!

940
00:46:59,621 --> 00:47:01,488
Oh...

941
00:47:03,223 --> 00:47:04,858
You guys are fucking with me?

942
00:47:08,095 --> 00:47:10,364
Oh, you guys
are fucking with me.

943
00:47:12,466 --> 00:47:13,467
Fuck!

944
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:15,869
Cute.

945
00:47:15,903 --> 00:47:17,304
No!

946
00:47:18,238 --> 00:47:20,107
Okay.

947
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,580
Everyone needs
to take a deep breath.

948
00:47:22,376 --> 00:47:23,410
Alice.

949
00:47:23,444 --> 00:47:24,522
Sophie: Give me my knife back!

950
00:47:24,546 --> 00:47:26,380
What the fuck is going on?

951
00:47:26,413 --> 00:47:28,550
I don't know!

952
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:30,451
Put down the weapons.
Jordan: You put it down.

953
00:47:30,484 --> 00:47:31,919
Now!

954
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,621
On the floor!

955
00:47:35,356 --> 00:47:36,567
Jordan: Okay, okay.
How about this?

956
00:47:36,591 --> 00:47:37,934
Put it down.
Jordan: Okay, okay, okay.

957
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:39,226
Okay, we'll put them down.

958
00:47:39,259 --> 00:47:40,538
We'll put... we'll all
put them down.

959
00:47:40,562 --> 00:47:42,482
Right? We'll put them down
if you put yours down.

960
00:47:43,297 --> 00:47:44,365
We'll put them down.

961
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:47,669
Okay.

962
00:47:47,702 --> 00:47:49,604
Okay.
Yeah, please, please.

963
00:47:49,637 --> 00:47:51,205
That seems fair.
Alice: Yeah.

964
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:53,173
Okay.

965
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:54,308
Putting it down.

966
00:47:55,577 --> 00:47:57,177
We're good.
Yeah.

967
00:47:57,211 --> 00:47:58,946
Okay, this is good.

968
00:47:59,614 --> 00:48:01,048
All right.

969
00:48:04,451 --> 00:48:06,420
Jordan!
Are you okay?

970
00:48:06,453 --> 00:48:08,021
Ow!
Alice: Stop! Stop!

971
00:48:08,956 --> 00:48:10,357
Please stop!
Greg: Alice?

972
00:48:12,594 --> 00:48:13,994
Alice: Stop. Stop!

973
00:48:14,027 --> 00:48:15,229
No! No!

974
00:48:23,605 --> 00:48:25,939
Sophie! No.
No, no, no, Sophie!

975
00:48:56,069 --> 00:48:57,938
Greg: Mother fucker.

976
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:10,083
Oh, my god.

977
00:49:11,285 --> 00:49:13,287
Oh, my god.

978
00:49:37,177 --> 00:49:38,445
Alice: This isn't right.

979
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:42,149
He didn't do it.

980
00:49:42,182 --> 00:49:45,118
Alice, how do you know?
How do you that know he did?

981
00:49:46,253 --> 00:49:47,488
Look, I mean, like...

982
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:50,324
If you look at all of us, like,

983
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:53,060
on paper, logically,

984
00:49:53,093 --> 00:49:55,563
he is the most likely
to commit an act of violence.

985
00:49:55,597 --> 00:49:57,130
On paper?

986
00:49:58,432 --> 00:50:01,268
What the fuck
are you even talking about?

987
00:50:01,301 --> 00:50:02,135
I mean, he's the only one

988
00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:04,137
who served in the military,
right? So...

989
00:50:05,272 --> 00:50:06,340
What?

990
00:50:07,775 --> 00:50:09,677
Jordan: He's a vet.

991
00:50:09,711 --> 00:50:11,411
Right? Like Iraq? Or...

992
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:13,146
Emma: No, I thought
it was Afghanistan.

993
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,717
He was a veterinarian.

994
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,519
He was
a veterinarian's assistant.

995
00:50:17,552 --> 00:50:19,621
Are you fucking
serious right now?

996
00:50:19,654 --> 00:50:21,823
Emma: Then why did
you call him g.I. Joe?

997
00:50:21,856 --> 00:50:24,692
Because... have you seen him?

998
00:50:24,726 --> 00:50:26,694
Well, regardless, either way,

999
00:50:26,728 --> 00:50:30,665
like, out of all of us,
he is the biggest unknown.

1000
00:50:30,698 --> 00:50:32,199
We've known each other forever.

1001
00:50:32,232 --> 00:50:34,636
Alice: Jordan, what are
you trying to do?

1002
00:50:34,669 --> 00:50:36,547
Jordan: I'm not...
I'm not trying to do anything.

1003
00:50:36,571 --> 00:50:38,773
Alice: He's dead, okay?

1004
00:50:38,806 --> 00:50:40,675
He's dead. We killed him.

1005
00:50:40,708 --> 00:50:42,175
She killed him.

1006
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,321
Go change your shirt.

1007
00:50:59,527 --> 00:51:02,697
Emma: We need to leave.
We need to get out of here.

1008
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,097
We don't have a car.

1009
00:51:04,131 --> 00:51:05,833
Okay, I'm going to walk.
Emma, stop.

1010
00:51:05,867 --> 00:51:06,977
What do you mean?
You can't just fucking...

1011
00:51:07,001 --> 00:51:09,303
Jordan: Emma, you're literally
in the middle of nowhere.

1012
00:51:09,336 --> 00:51:10,738
Where are you going?

1013
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:25,118
Alice: I mean, it could
have been any of us.

1014
00:51:25,152 --> 00:51:27,387
We all scattered
when the lights went out.

1015
00:51:27,421 --> 00:51:30,390
I mean, it could
have been Max, okay?

1016
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:32,459
Alice, you don't know
what you are talking about.

1017
00:51:32,492 --> 00:51:35,128
He punched David
in the face
because of you.

1018
00:51:35,162 --> 00:51:36,864
Just because Max
is in love with me

1019
00:51:36,898 --> 00:51:38,533
doesn't mean
he would kill David.

1020
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:41,435
Oh, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

1021
00:51:41,936 --> 00:51:43,170
Emma: What?

1022
00:51:43,203 --> 00:51:46,306
This is not about you and Max.

1023
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,809
Why are you being so mean?

1024
00:51:47,842 --> 00:51:49,677
Because I'm upset, Emma.

1025
00:51:49,711 --> 00:51:51,813
I'm upset because somebody
killed my best friend.

1026
00:51:51,846 --> 00:51:54,348
Sophie, did you use?
I can believe you're making

1027
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:56,350
this about you.

1028
00:51:56,383 --> 00:51:59,854
I'm sad, too, okay?
I'm scared, too.

1029
00:51:59,887 --> 00:52:02,189
I loved him so much.

1030
00:52:02,222 --> 00:52:03,691
It didn't seem like it.

1031
00:52:03,725 --> 00:52:05,492
What?
Sophie: It seemed like

1032
00:52:05,526 --> 00:52:06,761
you loved having a boyfriend.

1033
00:52:06,794 --> 00:52:08,261
And you loved
feeling comfortable.

1034
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:10,464
But, no, you did not love him.

1035
00:52:10,497 --> 00:52:12,165
You didn't even
fucking like him.

1036
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:13,744
You were just too scared
to do anything about it.

1037
00:52:13,768 --> 00:52:15,946
So you stayed for three years
longer than you should have

1038
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:17,371
because you're a coward.

1039
00:52:17,805 --> 00:52:19,239
No, I'm not.

1040
00:52:19,907 --> 00:52:21,609
No, I'm not.

1041
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:23,845
I'm not.

1042
00:52:24,512 --> 00:52:25,913
I'm not. Right? I...

1043
00:52:26,914 --> 00:52:28,683
You're... you're so toxic.

1044
00:52:28,716 --> 00:52:29,884
Emma, calm down.
You are.

1045
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:31,318
No! No, I'm not gonna...

1046
00:52:31,351 --> 00:52:32,887
You are so toxic.

1047
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,657
And, honestly, when you fell
off the face of the earth,

1048
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,692
David was relieved.

1049
00:52:37,725 --> 00:52:41,428
He was relieved he didn't
have to deal with you anymore.

1050
00:52:41,461 --> 00:52:43,239
I wish they had chopped off
your head instead,

1051
00:52:43,263 --> 00:52:44,464
you spineless piece of shit.

1052
00:52:44,899 --> 00:52:46,333
Sophie.

1053
00:52:46,366 --> 00:52:47,602
Alice: Jesus fucking Christ.

1054
00:52:49,537 --> 00:52:50,738
Emma.

1055
00:52:50,772 --> 00:52:52,640
Emma, come on. Wait.

1056
00:52:52,674 --> 00:52:54,474
Wait.
Alice: Emma.

1057
00:52:54,509 --> 00:52:55,610
Emma.

1058
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,310
Emma.

1059
00:52:58,278 --> 00:52:59,747
Jordan: That was
real nice, soph.

1060
00:53:00,948 --> 00:53:02,382
Guys...

1061
00:53:03,718 --> 00:53:04,852
Where the fuck is bee?

1062
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:34,709
Sophie: Emma.

1063
00:54:36,077 --> 00:54:37,377
I'm so sorry.

1064
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:38,780
I'm so sorry.

1065
00:54:38,813 --> 00:54:40,047
I'm really sorry.

1066
00:54:40,081 --> 00:54:42,349
I'm so fucked up right now.

1067
00:54:43,584 --> 00:54:44,652
I'm sorry.

1068
00:54:45,418 --> 00:54:46,888
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1069
00:54:46,921 --> 00:54:48,841
Okay? It was just, like,
things started coming...

1070
00:54:54,461 --> 00:54:56,697
Isn't that what you wanted?

1071
00:54:58,465 --> 00:54:59,710
Yeah, Emma,
that's what I wanted.

1072
00:54:59,734 --> 00:55:00,811
That's what I was
in the mood for.

1073
00:55:00,835 --> 00:55:02,804
Thank you very much.
What the fuck?

1074
00:55:02,837 --> 00:55:04,471
Jesus Christ!

1075
00:55:04,505 --> 00:55:05,849
You always think everyone
is in love with you.

1076
00:55:05,873 --> 00:55:07,041
It's so crazy.
I...

1077
00:55:08,075 --> 00:55:09,644
I'm sorry.

1078
00:55:09,677 --> 00:55:10,745
I'm sorry.

1079
00:55:10,778 --> 00:55:11,846
Do you want this?

1080
00:55:13,948 --> 00:55:14,982
Yeah.

1081
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:16,349
Thank you.

1082
00:55:16,383 --> 00:55:17,484
Sure.

1083
00:55:31,065 --> 00:55:32,365
Alice: Bee?

1084
00:55:41,408 --> 00:55:42,442
Soph?

1085
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:07,467
Jordan: Emma?

1086
00:57:17,538 --> 00:57:18,606
Help!

1087
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:19,941
Jordan!

1088
00:57:20,675 --> 00:57:21,542
Help!

1089
00:57:21,575 --> 00:57:23,544
Help.
Jordan: Where are you?

1090
00:57:23,577 --> 00:57:25,046
Help! Please, help! Help!

1091
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:27,982
Help! Help! Help!

1092
00:57:29,617 --> 00:57:30,718
Emma.

1093
00:57:30,751 --> 00:57:31,895
Jordan: Oh, my god.
Alice: Emma.

1094
00:57:31,919 --> 00:57:34,121
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

1095
00:57:34,155 --> 00:57:35,823
What happened?
I don't know!

1096
00:57:35,856 --> 00:57:37,058
I don't know.

1097
00:57:39,694 --> 00:57:41,729
Don't touch her!
I'm just trying to...

1098
00:57:41,762 --> 00:57:43,173
Don't. No!
Figure out what happened.

1099
00:57:43,197 --> 00:57:44,808
Jordan: How am I supposed
to know if I don't touch her?

1100
00:57:44,832 --> 00:57:46,499
Alice: Don't, just don't,
just don't.

1101
00:57:47,001 --> 00:57:48,836
Oh, fuck.

1102
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:49,937
Oh, my god.

1103
00:57:51,772 --> 00:57:53,774
Alice: I heard something.

1104
00:57:53,808 --> 00:57:56,577
Um, maybe she...

1105
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:58,546
Oh, my god.

1106
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:00,548
She fell, maybe she tripped?
Alice: No.

1107
00:58:00,581 --> 00:58:02,750
No, no. She...

1108
00:58:02,783 --> 00:58:04,919
She... she got pushed, okay?

1109
00:58:04,952 --> 00:58:07,521
She was pushed.
I told you it wasn't Greg!

1110
00:58:07,555 --> 00:58:09,123
Jordan: Are you happy
that she's dead?

1111
00:58:09,156 --> 00:58:11,726
No, but I told you
it wasn't Greg!

1112
00:58:20,001 --> 00:58:21,836
I did... I did tell you.

1113
00:58:28,209 --> 00:58:29,910
Alice: Don't you see
what's happening?

1114
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:33,948
What?

1115
00:58:33,981 --> 00:58:35,149
Who was the killer?

1116
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:36,217
What?

1117
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:39,120
Who was the killer?

1118
00:58:39,754 --> 00:58:40,755
In the game?

1119
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:43,824
It's following the same pattern.

1120
00:58:43,858 --> 00:58:44,859
The deaths.

1121
00:58:44,892 --> 00:58:46,627
Please... please,
just stop talking, please!

1122
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,796
David, Greg, Emma.

1123
00:58:48,829 --> 00:58:50,331
David, Greg, Emma.

1124
00:58:50,364 --> 00:58:51,799
Jordan: No.
Yes!

1125
00:58:51,832 --> 00:58:53,072
Fucking yes, Jordan!
Jordan: No.

1126
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,669
No, it's not
following the same pattern.

1127
00:58:55,703 --> 00:58:58,873
Greg died and then
we executed David.

1128
00:58:58,906 --> 00:59:01,275
But in real life,
David died and then we...

1129
00:59:01,308 --> 00:59:06,247
Okay, but Greg, David, Emma.
Greg, David, Emma.

1130
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,958
I mean, why else would
somebody leave her there

1131
00:59:07,982 --> 00:59:09,259
unless they wanted us
to find her?

1132
00:59:09,283 --> 00:59:10,818
Why would they want us
to find her?

1133
00:59:10,851 --> 00:59:13,854
Because they're playing
a sick fucking game.

1134
00:59:14,221 --> 00:59:15,790
Okay?

1135
00:59:15,823 --> 00:59:17,758
Who was the killer?
I wasn't the killer.

1136
00:59:17,792 --> 00:59:18,759
Alice, you're fucking coked out.

1137
00:59:18,793 --> 00:59:21,162
You're coked out, okay?
We're all coked out.

1138
00:59:21,195 --> 00:59:22,763
I'm not.

1139
00:59:22,797 --> 00:59:23,998
I'm not.

1140
00:59:24,965 --> 00:59:26,100
Are you wearing make up?

1141
00:59:28,803 --> 00:59:30,304
I... I was upstairs,
changing my...

1142
00:59:30,337 --> 00:59:31,872
Alice: You look weird.

1143
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,241
Whose sweater is this?

1144
00:59:34,275 --> 00:59:35,609
I found it upstairs.

1145
00:59:36,877 --> 00:59:37,921
How long have you known her?

1146
00:59:37,945 --> 00:59:39,180
Stop, Alice.

1147
00:59:41,115 --> 00:59:42,116
Who are you?

1148
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:45,319
What?
You show up here,

1149
00:59:45,352 --> 00:59:47,354
start smiling at my boyfriend.

1150
00:59:49,223 --> 00:59:50,724
What are you talking about?

1151
00:59:50,758 --> 00:59:51,826
Your voice is trembling.

1152
00:59:51,859 --> 00:59:53,761
No. No.
Yeah. It is.

1153
00:59:53,794 --> 00:59:54,929
Jordan: I googled you.

1154
00:59:54,962 --> 00:59:56,630
And there was nobody
with your name

1155
00:59:56,664 --> 00:59:59,767
who graduated
from Utah state this year.

1156
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,670
There's literally no record
of your attendance, at all.

1157
01:00:02,703 --> 01:00:03,771
What the fuck?

1158
01:00:04,405 --> 01:00:06,173
Listen, I can explain.

1159
01:00:06,207 --> 01:00:07,675
Alice: Oh, my god.

1160
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:09,210
You discovered David's body.

1161
01:00:09,243 --> 01:00:10,420
No, I just...
You could have tampered

1162
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:11,345
with the generator,

1163
01:00:11,378 --> 01:00:12,856
just like you tampered
with Sophie's car.

1164
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:13,814
You said you
left the lights on, right?

1165
01:00:13,848 --> 01:00:16,016
Are you serious?
We watched you kill someone.

1166
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:18,119
You literally murdered Greg!

1167
01:00:18,152 --> 01:00:19,386
Literally!

1168
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,255
Literally! You sick fuck!

1169
01:00:21,288 --> 01:00:23,357
No, are you crazy? No.
Calm down.

1170
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:25,726
Let's just talk about it.
Talk about it?

1171
01:00:25,759 --> 01:00:27,161
Bee: Yeah.
No... no.

1172
01:00:27,194 --> 01:00:28,863
Bee: Let's just talk
about it, okay?

1173
01:00:28,896 --> 01:00:30,030
Mmm-mmm. I don't want to.

1174
01:00:30,064 --> 01:00:31,799
Bee: Sophie... Sophie.
Alice: No!

1175
01:00:31,832 --> 01:00:33,276
Bee: Sophie.
Ali, ce: Do not touch her!

1176
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,035
Whoa!

1177
01:00:35,069 --> 01:00:36,179
Alice: You know what?
I don't...

1178
01:00:36,203 --> 01:00:37,238
I don't want you in here.

1179
01:00:37,271 --> 01:00:38,339
Okay, calm down.

1180
01:00:38,372 --> 01:00:39,406
No, seriously.
Alice!

1181
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,680
Alice!
I don't want you in here.

1182
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:42,676
Bee: I... relax.
Just shut up! Shut up!

1183
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:44,011
I don't want you in here.

1184
01:00:44,044 --> 01:00:45,355
Get out of this room!
Let go of me, Alice.

1185
01:00:45,379 --> 01:00:46,456
Get the fuck out of this room!

1186
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,125
I don't want to look
at your face anymore. Get out.

1187
01:00:48,149 --> 01:00:49,226
Bee: Alice, calm down.
Alice: I'm not...

1188
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,727
Alice: I'm not calming down.
Bee: Let go of me, Alice.

1189
01:00:50,751 --> 01:00:52,820
No, you killed
my fucking boyfriend.

1190
01:00:52,853 --> 01:00:54,397
You know what? You know what?
It was self-defense.

1191
01:00:54,421 --> 01:00:55,465
Alice: I... I want her out.

1192
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:56,991
Jordan, can you help me?
All right.

1193
01:00:57,024 --> 01:00:58,392
Jordan!
Jesus, Alice.

1194
01:00:58,425 --> 01:00:59,827
Get the fucking door!

1195
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,328
Jesus fucking Christ!

1196
01:01:01,362 --> 01:01:02,830
I do not want her in here!

1197
01:01:02,863 --> 01:01:03,964
Bee: Relax!
Alice: No!

1198
01:01:03,998 --> 01:01:05,900
Bee: Relax!
Alice: No!

1199
01:01:05,933 --> 01:01:08,068
Sophie! Sophie, do something!

1200
01:01:08,102 --> 01:01:09,770
You killed him, get out!

1201
01:01:09,803 --> 01:01:11,172
Sophie!
Alice: Get out!

1202
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:17,311
Sophie!

1203
01:03:39,353 --> 01:03:40,588
Jordan: Stay here.

1204
01:05:21,723 --> 01:05:23,090
Alice: I'm so hungry.

1205
01:05:23,123 --> 01:05:24,167
Jordan: How can you
be hungry right now?

1206
01:05:24,191 --> 01:05:25,335
Alice: I wasn't
planning on this.

1207
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:27,194
Jordan: Alice...

1208
01:05:27,227 --> 01:05:29,564
What the fuck?
How the fuck you get in here?

1209
01:05:29,597 --> 01:05:31,198
She has a gun.

1210
01:05:31,231 --> 01:05:33,967
Jordan has a gun
in her pocket, Sophie,

1211
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:35,202
get away from her.

1212
01:05:35,235 --> 01:05:36,413
No, no, Sophie,
she's confusing...

1213
01:05:36,437 --> 01:05:37,505
Let go of me.

1214
01:05:37,539 --> 01:05:39,173
Are you kidding me?

1215
01:05:39,206 --> 01:05:40,508
I don't have a gun.

1216
01:05:40,542 --> 01:05:42,409
Bee: Then empty your pockets.

1217
01:05:44,546 --> 01:05:45,547
Slowly!

1218
01:05:55,523 --> 01:05:56,990
That's it?

1219
01:05:57,024 --> 01:05:58,225
That's it.

1220
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,962
Oh, my god.

1221
01:06:03,263 --> 01:06:04,364
You are the killer.

1222
01:06:06,634 --> 01:06:08,469
In the... in the game... I...

1223
01:06:08,503 --> 01:06:10,037
How the fuck
did you get in here?

1224
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:11,682
Where is the gun?
I don't have a fucking gun.

1225
01:06:11,706 --> 01:06:14,642
We locked all the doors.
How did you get in?

1226
01:06:14,676 --> 01:06:15,710
You killed him.

1227
01:06:15,743 --> 01:06:18,278
Why would I kill David?
Why would I kill David?

1228
01:06:18,312 --> 01:06:19,179
Why would I kill Emma?

1229
01:06:19,213 --> 01:06:20,113
They are, literally,
my oldest friends.

1230
01:06:20,147 --> 01:06:22,282
You just fucking met them!
How dare you?

1231
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:23,417
When I found David,

1232
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:26,019
you were the last person
to get there.

1233
01:06:27,087 --> 01:06:29,022
It took you awhile.
That's true.

1234
01:06:29,056 --> 01:06:31,458
Bee: Where were you
when Emma died, hmm?

1235
01:06:31,492 --> 01:06:33,093
You pushed her!
Shut up!

1236
01:06:33,126 --> 01:06:34,471
Guy's, don't listen to her.
You don't know what the fuck

1237
01:06:34,495 --> 01:06:36,196
you're talking about!
And then, I saw you.

1238
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,565
I saw you getting the gun.

1239
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:38,666
Jordan: That's a lie.

1240
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,034
That's a fucking lie.
You're lying. You're a liar!

1241
01:06:41,068 --> 01:06:42,737
You're lying through
your fucking teeth.

1242
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:43,605
You lied about everything.

1243
01:06:43,638 --> 01:06:45,172
You lied about
everything to Sophie.

1244
01:06:45,205 --> 01:06:46,774
You're a fucking liar.

1245
01:06:46,808 --> 01:06:49,076
Yeah, you...
You did lie to Sophie.

1246
01:06:53,681 --> 01:06:54,749
Okay.

1247
01:06:57,084 --> 01:06:58,118
Okay.

1248
01:07:02,322 --> 01:07:04,224
I did go to Utah state

1249
01:07:04,692 --> 01:07:06,661
for one semester.

1250
01:07:06,694 --> 01:07:10,732
But my mom was...
She was having a hard time

1251
01:07:10,765 --> 01:07:12,499
and I came home
to take care of her.

1252
01:07:15,302 --> 01:07:16,738
And I did work at gamehut,

1253
01:07:18,405 --> 01:07:20,440
but they shut down
our location, like,

1254
01:07:20,474 --> 01:07:22,744
a week after I met you. I...
I've been applying, but...

1255
01:07:22,777 --> 01:07:24,111
What were you doing
when I dropped

1256
01:07:24,144 --> 01:07:25,279
you off at the mall?

1257
01:07:29,817 --> 01:07:32,386
Hung out at
the food court. I...

1258
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:37,457
Didn't want to disappoint you.

1259
01:07:42,396 --> 01:07:43,565
I was embarrassed.

1260
01:07:48,201 --> 01:07:49,771
I should have told you.
I just...

1261
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:53,575
My mom, she...

1262
01:07:55,643 --> 01:07:56,811
She has...

1263
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:01,148
My mom has borderline.

1264
01:08:01,816 --> 01:08:03,383
Alice: Oh, my god.

1265
01:08:04,484 --> 01:08:06,554
I'm so sorry, that's...

1266
01:08:06,588 --> 01:08:07,855
That's really serious.

1267
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:10,758
Mental health
is a really serious issue.

1268
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:13,628
I mean, I've never actually
said this to anyone, but...

1269
01:08:16,496 --> 01:08:17,575
But I have body dysmorphia.

1270
01:08:17,599 --> 01:08:19,601
Oh, my god.
Shut the fuck up, Alice.

1271
01:08:21,936 --> 01:08:23,805
I wanted to tell you.
I just...

1272
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:29,777
I just really wanted
you to like me.

1273
01:08:39,654 --> 01:08:42,389
You've got to
be fucking kidding me.

1274
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:46,694
Oh, my god.

1275
01:08:46,728 --> 01:08:47,629
Jordan, what the fuck?

1276
01:08:47,662 --> 01:08:48,939
Are you telling me
that you believe that

1277
01:08:48,963 --> 01:08:49,831
pile of bullshit?

1278
01:08:49,864 --> 01:08:51,566
Is that supposed
to inspire confidence?

1279
01:08:51,599 --> 01:08:53,300
Her mom has "borderline."

1280
01:08:53,333 --> 01:08:55,803
Is that not a red fucking flag
to anybody else?

1281
01:08:55,837 --> 01:08:56,938
That's a serious issue.

1282
01:08:56,971 --> 01:08:58,405
Where the fuck did you get that?

1283
01:08:58,438 --> 01:08:59,473
David's dad's rich!

1284
01:08:59,507 --> 01:09:00,440
Rich people
have fucking guns, Sophie!

1285
01:09:00,474 --> 01:09:02,242
My parents are rich.
They don't have guns.

1286
01:09:02,275 --> 01:09:03,745
Well, I mean, we're all rich,

1287
01:09:03,778 --> 01:09:05,913
but you and David
are like rich, rich.

1288
01:09:05,947 --> 01:09:07,882
That has never mattered to me...

1289
01:09:07,915 --> 01:09:09,617
Oh, shut the fuck up!

1290
01:09:09,651 --> 01:09:11,519
We didn't even
want to invite you.

1291
01:09:11,552 --> 01:09:12,854
We debated about inviting you,

1292
01:09:12,887 --> 01:09:14,589
but because it's David's house.

1293
01:09:14,622 --> 01:09:15,890
I didn't say that, but...

1294
01:09:15,923 --> 01:09:17,825
And, no, you did not
respond in the group chat.

1295
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:20,494
And then, you show up
with this fucking psychopath.

1296
01:09:20,528 --> 01:09:22,664
Don't call her a psychopath,
that's so ableist.

1297
01:09:22,697 --> 01:09:24,297
Fuck you.
You deserve each other.

1298
01:09:24,331 --> 01:09:26,299
I hope she fucking suffocates
you in your sleep.

1299
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:29,302
Alice: Yeah, you didn't
reply in the chat.

1300
01:09:29,336 --> 01:09:31,939
And David actually told me

1301
01:09:31,973 --> 01:09:35,643
that you, like, begged him
to talk to your parents

1302
01:09:35,677 --> 01:09:38,445
and, like,
unlock your trust again.

1303
01:09:38,478 --> 01:09:39,857
And that's why
you're actually here.

1304
01:09:39,881 --> 01:09:41,214
Oh, yeah?

1305
01:09:41,248 --> 01:09:42,325
Oh, yeah, did he tell you that

1306
01:09:42,349 --> 01:09:43,727
while you guys were railing
lines in front of me.

1307
01:09:43,751 --> 01:09:44,585
Your addict friend

1308
01:09:44,619 --> 01:09:46,721
who you're supposedly
so worried about?

1309
01:09:46,754 --> 01:09:48,255
We are worried.
Sophie: No!

1310
01:09:48,288 --> 01:09:49,667
No, no, no.
Let me get this straight.

1311
01:09:49,691 --> 01:09:50,801
Okay, let me get this straight.

1312
01:09:50,825 --> 01:09:52,259
So, when the black girl

1313
01:09:52,292 --> 01:09:53,828
has a coke habit,
it's a problem.

1314
01:09:53,861 --> 01:09:55,530
But when everyone else
around her does it,

1315
01:09:55,563 --> 01:09:57,598
including her best friend,
who happens to be white

1316
01:09:58,032 --> 01:09:59,299
and male,

1317
01:09:59,332 --> 01:10:00,568
it's fine?

1318
01:10:00,601 --> 01:10:03,638
I understand and I'm an ally,

1319
01:10:03,671 --> 01:10:07,642
and I totally get how it...

1320
01:10:09,443 --> 01:10:10,578
Looks that way.

1321
01:10:11,646 --> 01:10:12,714
And...

1322
01:10:13,781 --> 01:10:14,882
Um...

1323
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:17,685
Jordan?
Oh, my god.

1324
01:10:17,719 --> 01:10:20,253
You are obsessed
with playing the victim.

1325
01:10:20,287 --> 01:10:21,189
Sophie: Excuse me?

1326
01:10:21,221 --> 01:10:22,857
I had to ride
in the ambulance with you

1327
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:24,892
three times,
thinking you were dead.

1328
01:10:24,926 --> 01:10:26,761
I needed help and I got it

1329
01:10:26,794 --> 01:10:27,929
and I'm sorry.
You got help?

1330
01:10:27,962 --> 01:10:31,398
You mean we
had to narc on you
to your fucking dad

1331
01:10:31,431 --> 01:10:33,801
so he'd cut you off
and ship you off to rehab,

1332
01:10:33,835 --> 01:10:37,270
while you were quite
literally kicking
and screaming.

1333
01:10:37,304 --> 01:10:38,539
Yeah.
And then you just

1334
01:10:38,573 --> 01:10:40,007
fell off the face of the earth.

1335
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:41,151
'Cause that's what you do, soph.

1336
01:10:41,175 --> 01:10:42,920
That's what you do
when things get tough,
you run.

1337
01:10:42,944 --> 01:10:45,345
You ran away to go write
your fucking memoirs.

1338
01:10:45,378 --> 01:10:47,380
It's creative non-fiction
which is a valid response

1339
01:10:47,414 --> 01:10:48,883
to life in an attention economy.

1340
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:50,551
Oh, fuck off and die.

1341
01:10:50,585 --> 01:10:51,686
You write little essays

1342
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:53,988
about your mommy and her vodka.

1343
01:10:54,021 --> 01:10:55,489
And your pussy
and your feelings.

1344
01:10:55,523 --> 01:10:56,758
And your fucking feelings.

1345
01:10:56,791 --> 01:10:58,559
Oh, my god, we are all drowning

1346
01:10:58,593 --> 01:10:59,961
in your fucking feelings.

1347
01:10:59,994 --> 01:11:02,997
Feelings are facts.
No! No, they're not.

1348
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:04,297
Facts are facts.

1349
01:11:04,331 --> 01:11:05,700
Why did you ghost us, Sophie?

1350
01:11:05,733 --> 01:11:06,868
Like why?

1351
01:11:07,869 --> 01:11:09,336
Because you fucking trigger me.

1352
01:11:11,404 --> 01:11:12,540
You enable me.

1353
01:11:13,975 --> 01:11:15,009
Does she know?

1354
01:11:15,042 --> 01:11:16,443
Sophie: Does she know what?

1355
01:11:17,078 --> 01:11:19,479
That you begged me

1356
01:11:19,514 --> 01:11:21,949
to stop at your apartment
on my way up here.

1357
01:11:21,983 --> 01:11:23,316
And I did.

1358
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:25,586
And we fucked in your car.

1359
01:11:26,721 --> 01:11:27,588
She's fucking lying.

1360
01:11:27,622 --> 01:11:28,899
She's lying through
her fucking teeth.

1361
01:11:28,923 --> 01:11:29,967
She's trying to get
in your head.

1362
01:11:29,991 --> 01:11:31,692
Don't listen to her, okay?

1363
01:11:31,726 --> 01:11:32,827
Check her texts.

1364
01:11:35,495 --> 01:11:37,532
You are unhinged, Jordan.

1365
01:11:38,866 --> 01:11:41,669
You are devoid of empathy.

1366
01:11:41,702 --> 01:11:43,004
You have no feelings.

1367
01:11:43,037 --> 01:11:44,806
Do you want to know
why I could never

1368
01:11:44,839 --> 01:11:46,306
ever be with you?

1369
01:11:47,374 --> 01:11:48,475
Because you schedule

1370
01:11:48,509 --> 01:11:50,511
everything in your
fucking Google calendar,

1371
01:11:50,545 --> 01:11:51,746
including sex.

1372
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:53,881
Because you have no soul.

1373
01:11:53,915 --> 01:11:54,982
Jordan: Fuck you.

1374
01:11:55,016 --> 01:11:56,884
You're emotionally abusive.

1375
01:11:56,918 --> 01:11:58,418
I had to go to therapy for PTSD.

1376
01:11:58,451 --> 01:12:00,353
You can fucking ask Alice.

1377
01:12:00,387 --> 01:12:02,089
Yeah, she did.

1378
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:04,091
For a long time.

1379
01:12:09,496 --> 01:12:11,364
You hate Alice.

1380
01:12:11,398 --> 01:12:13,034
No, I don't.
Yeah, you despise her.

1381
01:12:13,067 --> 01:12:14,545
You complain constantly
about how vapid

1382
01:12:14,569 --> 01:12:15,937
and annoying she is.
You hate her.

1383
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:17,805
It's pitiful how
you won't stop making fun

1384
01:12:17,839 --> 01:12:19,907
of her stupid little podcast.

1385
01:12:19,941 --> 01:12:21,474
Let her have the podcast.

1386
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:24,377
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1387
01:12:24,411 --> 01:12:27,648
You hate listen to her podcast.

1388
01:12:27,682 --> 01:12:28,683
Wait...

1389
01:12:29,083 --> 01:12:30,383
What?

1390
01:12:31,451 --> 01:12:32,954
And you made us
swear on our lives

1391
01:12:32,987 --> 01:12:34,088
not to tell anyone.

1392
01:12:34,856 --> 01:12:36,023
Jordan, is that true?

1393
01:12:37,424 --> 01:12:39,527
I like your podcast, Alice.

1394
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:42,429
What is your podcast about?

1395
01:12:42,462 --> 01:12:44,464
Hanging out with
your smartest
and funniest friend.

1396
01:12:44,497 --> 01:12:47,969
Did you just groan?

1397
01:12:48,002 --> 01:12:49,036
No.

1398
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:50,004
When I said "hanging out

1399
01:12:50,037 --> 01:12:52,006
"with your smartest
and funniest friend."

1400
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:54,508
Oh, my god.
Like that. Like that!

1401
01:12:54,542 --> 01:12:55,710
Fuck!
You just did it again.

1402
01:12:55,743 --> 01:12:57,044
No, I didn't!
First of all,

1403
01:12:57,078 --> 01:12:59,747
a podcast takes
a lot of work, okay?

1404
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:01,082
You have to organize the guests.

1405
01:13:01,115 --> 01:13:02,884
You have to do a Google calendar

1406
01:13:02,917 --> 01:13:05,119
and you build a following.

1407
01:13:05,152 --> 01:13:06,888
It takes a long fucking time!

1408
01:13:06,921 --> 01:13:08,723
And I've been working
on it for a while!

1409
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:10,758
Okay?

1410
01:13:10,791 --> 01:13:12,760
And then, let me say,

1411
01:13:12,793 --> 01:13:15,763
that nobody likes you, okay?

1412
01:13:15,796 --> 01:13:19,066
Nobody likes you!
Nobody likes you!

1413
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:20,811
Do you know
when you're drunk
and you cry to me,

1414
01:13:20,835 --> 01:13:22,503
"oh, I'm afraid nobody likes me

1415
01:13:22,536 --> 01:13:24,147
"because I'm mean
and a bitch and I suck."

1416
01:13:24,171 --> 01:13:27,541
Well, you do, okay?
You fucking suck.

1417
01:13:27,575 --> 01:13:29,710
And I only hang out
with you out of pity

1418
01:13:29,744 --> 01:13:32,580
and the suffocating weight
of our shared history.

1419
01:13:32,613 --> 01:13:34,849
And that is all.

1420
01:13:34,882 --> 01:13:37,484
And you're just so in love

1421
01:13:37,518 --> 01:13:39,654
with your rags
to riches narrative,

1422
01:13:39,687 --> 01:13:41,589
like you're the only
fucking person in the world

1423
01:13:41,622 --> 01:13:43,157
who didn't come from money.

1424
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:45,159
You know what?

1425
01:13:45,192 --> 01:13:49,196
Your parents
are upper middle class.

1426
01:13:50,698 --> 01:13:51,799
No, they're not.

1427
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:53,433
Jordan.

1428
01:13:54,168 --> 01:13:56,003
They are.

1429
01:13:56,037 --> 01:13:58,105
They teach at a university.

1430
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:01,509
It's public.

1431
01:14:01,542 --> 01:14:03,644
Oh, my god.

1432
01:14:03,678 --> 01:14:06,647
Oh, my god, I mean,
no wonder Sophie od'd.

1433
01:14:06,681 --> 01:14:08,149
Who could date
a fucking spreadsheet

1434
01:14:08,182 --> 01:14:09,583
with a superiority complex?

1435
01:14:09,617 --> 01:14:11,097
It's, like, you're such a...

1436
01:14:11,919 --> 01:14:13,988
Ow!

1437
01:14:14,922 --> 01:14:16,657
What the fuck?

1438
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:17,992
Sophie: What the fuck, Jordan?

1439
01:14:18,025 --> 01:14:21,028
Alice: Oh, my god.
Are you serious?

1440
01:14:21,062 --> 01:14:22,697
Did you just fucking shoot me?

1441
01:14:24,832 --> 01:14:27,168
No.
Alice: You fucking shot me.

1442
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:28,936
With a gun!

1443
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:29,937
Jordan: No,
I didn't shoot you. I...

1444
01:14:29,971 --> 01:14:32,139
Alice: You fucking
murdered them, you freak!

1445
01:14:32,173 --> 01:14:34,608
You're the murderer.
I knew it!

1446
01:14:34,642 --> 01:14:36,177
I knew it, you're such a bitch!

1447
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:37,144
You're such a fucking bitch!

1448
01:14:37,178 --> 01:14:39,146
I didn't murder anybody.
Alice: Yes, you did.

1449
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:40,748
Jordan, put the gun down.

1450
01:14:40,781 --> 01:14:42,783
Alice: I've never
been shot before.

1451
01:14:42,817 --> 01:14:45,853
It really fucking hurts!

1452
01:14:45,886 --> 01:14:47,588
Sophie: Put the fucking
gun down, please.

1453
01:14:47,621 --> 01:14:49,590
You did this.
You made me do this.

1454
01:14:49,623 --> 01:14:50,858
Why did you make me do that?

1455
01:14:50,891 --> 01:14:51,969
What are you doing?
Put the gun down.

1456
01:14:51,993 --> 01:14:54,128
Why? Why did you shoot me?

1457
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:55,129
Jordan: I did not shoot you.

1458
01:14:55,162 --> 01:14:57,031
Yes, you did! With that gun!
Stop, stop, stop.

1459
01:14:57,064 --> 01:14:58,699
Alice, stop. Stop!
With that gun.

1460
01:14:58,733 --> 01:15:00,668
Stop waving it around.
I'm not waving.

1461
01:15:00,701 --> 01:15:02,036
Don't hit me.
You already shot me.

1462
01:15:02,069 --> 01:15:03,871
Stop! Don't touch me.

1463
01:15:03,904 --> 01:15:05,248
Sophie: No, no, no!
Alice: Get the gun!

1464
01:15:05,272 --> 01:15:07,074
Sophie: No!
Alice: Sophie, the gun!

1465
01:15:07,108 --> 01:15:08,642
Don't! Stop!
You're on my leg!

1466
01:15:08,676 --> 01:15:09,810
You're on my leg!

1467
01:15:10,578 --> 01:15:11,946
I want it. Give it to me!

1468
01:15:11,979 --> 01:15:14,148
Jordan: No!
Sophie: Let go!

1469
01:15:18,652 --> 01:15:19,754
Jordan: No!

1470
01:15:19,787 --> 01:15:21,122
Sophie: Ow!

1471
01:15:21,155 --> 01:15:22,623
Alice: No!

1472
01:15:22,656 --> 01:15:23,557
No!
Alice: Give it to me.

1473
01:15:23,591 --> 01:15:24,935
Give me it! Give me it!
Get off of me! No!

1474
01:15:24,959 --> 01:15:26,069
Jordan: Get the fuck off me!

1475
01:15:26,093 --> 01:15:27,294
Get off!

1476
01:15:29,897 --> 01:15:31,866
Ow! My fucking leg!

1477
01:15:31,899 --> 01:15:33,567
Sophie: Where is it?

1478
01:15:33,601 --> 01:15:35,169
Alice: Ow!

1479
01:16:16,644 --> 01:16:17,845
I didn't do it.

1480
01:16:29,957 --> 01:16:31,258
Please, don't move.

1481
01:16:31,292 --> 01:16:32,660
Don't you fucking move.

1482
01:16:32,693 --> 01:16:34,061
It's okay...
It's okay, Jordan.

1483
01:16:34,095 --> 01:16:35,930
Please, don't do it.

1484
01:16:35,963 --> 01:16:37,398
Please, just...

1485
01:16:37,431 --> 01:16:40,935
Stop! I didn't do it.
Please, just stop, okay?

1486
01:16:40,968 --> 01:16:42,736
Just put it down.
Please, stop moving.

1487
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:45,272
Please... please,
don't follow me, please.

1488
01:16:45,306 --> 01:16:48,175
Please...
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

1489
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:49,743
Stop, stop, stop!

1490
01:16:49,777 --> 01:16:51,045
Sophie: Why are we doing this?

1491
01:16:51,078 --> 01:16:52,413
Jordan: Don't come up here.

1492
01:16:52,446 --> 01:16:53,681
Don't, please, don't.

1493
01:16:53,714 --> 01:16:54,791
Sophie: Please put it down.

1494
01:16:54,815 --> 01:16:56,750
Jordan: Please stop.
Please stay there.

1495
01:16:56,784 --> 01:16:57,818
Oh, my god.

1496
01:16:57,852 --> 01:16:59,053
Sophie: Please...

1497
01:17:01,322 --> 01:17:03,190
Jordan: Stop.
Sophie: I'm begging you...

1498
01:17:03,224 --> 01:17:05,392
Don't fucking come up here.
Please.

1499
01:17:05,426 --> 01:17:07,928
Sophie, I'm serious,
just stay there.

1500
01:17:09,096 --> 01:17:10,164
Sophie: Stop.

1501
01:17:10,197 --> 01:17:12,066
Just stay there.
Just please stay there.

1502
01:17:12,099 --> 01:17:13,000
I'm begging you.

1503
01:17:13,033 --> 01:17:17,138
Please, fucking...
Fucking stay there! Fuck!

1504
01:17:36,223 --> 01:17:37,224
Sophie: Bee!

1505
01:18:11,258 --> 01:18:14,962
Check her texts.

1506
01:19:04,144 --> 01:19:05,446
Sophie.

1507
01:19:10,484 --> 01:19:11,952
Did you kill Emma?

1508
01:19:12,253 --> 01:19:13,287
No.

1509
01:19:16,824 --> 01:19:17,992
Did you?

1510
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:19,460
No.

1511
01:19:21,929 --> 01:19:24,965
It's okay, if you did it.
It's okay.

1512
01:19:26,601 --> 01:19:29,303
I just want to know.
You can tell me.

1513
01:19:29,336 --> 01:19:31,805
Did you kill David?
What?

1514
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,107
No.

1515
01:19:33,508 --> 01:19:34,808
You killed Greg.

1516
01:19:34,842 --> 01:19:36,544
To protect you.

1517
01:19:36,578 --> 01:19:38,078
I had to.

1518
01:19:57,031 --> 01:19:58,432
Will you answer this honestly?

1519
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,802
Okay, I promise. What is it?

1520
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:03,470
Did you...

1521
01:20:04,204 --> 01:20:05,306
With Jordan?

1522
01:20:06,073 --> 01:20:07,207
No.

1523
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:08,876
No.

1524
01:20:10,177 --> 01:20:13,213
No, I didn't...
I didn't. I would never.

1525
01:20:15,617 --> 01:20:16,984
I love you, okay?

1526
01:20:23,891 --> 01:20:25,025
Do you love me?

1527
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,135
I just wanted to touch you.

1528
01:20:36,203 --> 01:20:37,237
You frighten me.

1529
01:20:45,446 --> 01:20:46,548
Sophie: Bee!

1530
01:20:51,018 --> 01:20:52,219
Bee!

1531
01:20:54,355 --> 01:20:56,123
We have to stay together!

1532
01:20:57,124 --> 01:20:58,892
Bee!

1533
01:21:03,931 --> 01:21:04,998
Bee!

1534
01:21:12,106 --> 01:21:13,140
Bee?

1535
01:21:16,443 --> 01:21:17,612
Bee?

1536
01:21:19,681 --> 01:21:21,181
Where are you?

1537
01:21:24,418 --> 01:21:25,653
I love you.

1538
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:31,392
We have to stay together.

1539
01:21:37,231 --> 01:21:38,465
Bee!

1540
01:21:44,405 --> 01:21:45,973
- Okay.
- Bee!

1541
01:23:50,097 --> 01:23:51,231
Hey, hey.

1542
01:23:53,433 --> 01:23:56,203
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1543
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,474
I have to tell you something.

1544
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:04,779
I went to Alice's room and I...

1545
01:24:04,812 --> 01:24:07,515
And then I found coke
and then...

1546
01:24:07,549 --> 01:24:11,251
I... I said all these things
to Emma and she...

1547
01:24:11,285 --> 01:24:13,320
I... I gave her pills
'cause...

1548
01:24:14,354 --> 01:24:16,156
And then she tripped and fell.

1549
01:24:18,526 --> 01:24:19,661
It's my fault.

1550
01:24:20,828 --> 01:24:23,665
Sophie, it's okay. It's okay.

1551
01:24:25,867 --> 01:24:27,735
Sophie: I thought no one
would believe me.

1552
01:24:34,842 --> 01:24:36,143
Give me your phone.

1553
01:24:38,345 --> 01:24:39,379
What?

1554
01:24:39,413 --> 01:24:41,516
I want to see
your text with Jordan.

1555
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:44,351
No.

1556
01:24:44,384 --> 01:24:45,620
I have to see your texts.

1557
01:24:48,322 --> 01:24:49,356
Please?

1558
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:17,518
Sophie: No.
Sophie.

1559
01:25:17,552 --> 01:25:18,786
Sophie: Stop!

1560
01:26:01,629 --> 01:26:02,897
That's not my phone.

1561
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:04,431
Oh... what?

1562
01:26:09,904 --> 01:26:11,338
That's not my phone.
