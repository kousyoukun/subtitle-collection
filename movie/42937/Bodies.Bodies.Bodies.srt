大学二年级生,你想要什么?我是清醒的。

151
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:38,679
耶!不,谢谢。
Yay! No, thanks.

152
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,281
恭喜。

格雷格:干杯。艾玛:干杯。
Greg: Cheers. Emma: Cheers.

154
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,660
格雷格:飓风!
Greg: To hurricanes!

155
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,019
乔丹:去飓风派对!
Jordan: To hurricane parties!

156
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,954
格雷格:是的。乔丹:飓风。
Greg: Yeah. Jordan: To hurricanes.

157
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,255
飓风。

158
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:49,323
乔丹:深。
Jordan: Deep.

159
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,997
这是开始的家伙!
Guys it's starting!

160
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,869
派对时间!
Party time!

161
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,037
开始。
Starting.

162
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:05,306
大便。他妈的。
Shit. Fuck.

163
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,711
好吧，麦克斯怎么了?
Okay, what's going on with Max?

164
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:11,580
没什么。他在哪里?
Nothing. Where is he?

165
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,747
他只是在休息。他会回来的。
He's just taking a break. He'll be back.

166
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:14,849
这是什么意思?
What does that mean?

167
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:19,353
你就这点本事吗，混蛋!
Is that all you got, motherfucker!

168
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:27,261
我们走吧!
Let's go!

169
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,774
嘿,fuckface !
Hey, fuckface!

170
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:41,909
我们能谈谈吗?
Can we talk for a second?

171
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:44,245
你可以敲门吗?不，这是我的房子。
Can you knock? No, it's my house.

172
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:46,080
当然。有什么事吗?
Sure. What's up?

173
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:47,948
在私人。哦!
In private. Oh!

174
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:49,083
确定。
Sure.

175
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:52,052
我很抱歉。他会学习。
I'm sorry. He'll learn.

176
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:54,088
我马上回来。
I'll be right back.

177
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:56,161
大卫:是啊，汤姆·汉克斯在<i>漂流者>里就是这么说的
David: Yeah, that's what Tom Hanks said in <i>castaway.</i>

178
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:58,959
<i>她其实很可爱
<i>She's actually really cute.</i>

179
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:01,362
就像校园枪击案那样。
In like a school shooter type of way.

180
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:04,865
“给你带了西葫芦面包，戴夫。”
"Brought you zucchini bread, Dave."

181
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,233
她是我的。手了。
She's mine. Hands off.

182
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:25,819
乔丹:嘿。
Jordan: Hey.

183
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,957
噢,嗨……我…
Oh, hi... I...

184
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,892
呃，我只是…不不，我知道。
Uh, I was just... No, no, I know.

185
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:35,329
它是美丽的。这所房子。
It's beautiful. The house.

186
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,698
苏菲的父母有一个更大的。
Sophie's parents have one that's even bigger.

187
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,271
小心点，好吗?
Just be careful, okay?

188
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,942
索菲娅。只是…
With Sophie. Just...

189
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:52,479
小心些而已。
Be careful.

190
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,315
好的。
Okay.

191
00:11:56,551 --> 00:11:57,885
好的。
Okay.

192
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:09,330
但他，好像，一点都不性感。你明白我的意思吗?
But he's, like, not hot. You know what I mean?

193
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:10,464
他就像你妈妈一样
He's like, like, your mom

194
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:11,999
会说，“哦，他很性感。”
would be like, "ooh, he's hot."

195
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,335
不是你妈妈，我是说所有的妈妈。
Not your mom, I mean moms in general.

196
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:15,236
已经结婚的妈妈
Moms that have been married

197
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:17,171
10到15年之后，他们发现，
for like 10, 15 years and they see, like,

198
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,839
他从星巴克出来…
him going out of a Starbucks...

199
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,075
爱丽丝可以瞒着别人带个人来。
Alice got to bring someone without telling anyone.

200
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,042
所以你读了聊天。
So you do read the chat.

201
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:24,144
为什么大家都这么沉迷聊天?
Why is everyone so obsessed with the chat?

202
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:26,256
现在,你在这里。我在这里，我们在一起，对吧?
Now, you're here. I'm here, we're here together, right?

203
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,949
我们为什么要担心聊天的事?
Why are we worrying about the chat?

204
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:30,417
当我们能活在当下。
When we can just live in the moment.

205
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:31,495
是啊，因为你去了戒毒所
Yeah, it's 'cause you went to rehab

206
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,554
你也没有吸毒。
and you're not on drugs.

207
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:33,454
所以，一切就像，
So, like, everything is like,

208
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:36,924
"我们干嘛不都冷静点呢，伙计"
"ooh, why don't we just all be cool, man?"

209
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,860
你对格雷格有意见吗?
You have a little problem with Greg?

210
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:42,296
伐木工人。
The lumberjack.

211
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,364
这是一个新的豆荚。
It's a new pod.

212
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:45,933
我还不习惯吸入。
I'm not used to the inhaling yet.

213
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,268
他多大了，40岁吗?
What is he, like, 40?

214
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:48,579
我不知道。我想爱丽丝找到他了
I don't know. I think Alice found him

215
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:50,204
在陌陌上，或者别的什么。
on tinder, or some shit.

216
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,339
显然，他在阿富汗。
Apparently, he was in Afghanistan.

217
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:54,942
我想他在军队里，或者什么地方，所以…
I think he was in the army, or some shit, so...

218
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,176
这是热的。
Well, that's hot.

219
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,078
他不是……他没那么性感。
He's not... He's not, like, that hot.

220
00:12:58,112 --> 00:12:59,356
你不必觉得他很有魅力，
You don't have to think he's attractive,

221
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,091
只要爱丽丝觉得他有吸引力就行了。
only Alice has to think that he's attractive.

222
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:02,349
就像，我觉得，
Like, I feel, like,

223
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:04,385
我比这更有吸引力。
I'm more attractive than that.

224
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:06,920
你会怎么做?绝对的。
You do? Absolutely.

225
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,188
它的特点是什么
And what are the features

226
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:09,366
你要拿出来谈吗?
that you're bringing to the table?

227
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,824
我看起来就像在做爱。
Well, I just look like I fuck.

228
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:12,259
你明白我的意思吗?嗯。
You know what I mean? Mmm.

229
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:14,361
我看起来像…我操。
I look like I... I fuck.

230
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:16,497
这就是我喜欢营造的氛围。
And that's the vibe I like to put out there.

231
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:18,332
是的。不,嗯,是的,
Yeah. No, uh, yeah,

232
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,176
他，他真的很帅。无论什么。
he's, he's really handsome. Whatever.

233
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,978
我是说，我们没必要一直谈论它。
I mean, we don't have to talk about it all the time.

234
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,380
你的脸怎么了?
What the fuck happened to your face?

235
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:24,271
他妈的马克斯。
Fucking Max.

236
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:27,074
马克斯,吗?是的，该死的麦克斯，真的。
Max did that? Yes, fucking Max, really.

237
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,184
好吧?我站在外面
Okay? I was standing outside

238
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,587
然后他就跑过来打我的眼睛。
and he just ran up to me and punched me in the eye.

239
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:30,787
刚跑到你面前?他只是这样做了。
Just ran up to you? He just did.

240
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,490
看它。他就这么走到你面前做了那件事，对吧?
Look at it. He just came up to you and did that, huh?

241
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:33,890
我认为它……实际上我认为它看起来
I think it... Actually think it looks

242
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,617
不过还是挺酷的。你不觉得吗?
kind of dope, though. Don't you think?

243
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,118
天越来越黑了。
It's getting fucking darker.

244
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:40,421
我看起来像个战士。对吧?
I look like a, like a warrior. Right?

245
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:41,998
就像，这有点…这很酷。
Like, it's kind of... It's kind of cool.

246
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,190
有点热。
Like, it's kind of hot.

247
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,602
比如，如果你看到我从7- 11便利店出来，
Like, if you saw me coming out of a 7-Eleven,

248
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:46,894
你就像…
you'd be like...

249
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:49,963
嗯…
Um...

250
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:52,366
那你有机会。
So have you had a chance to, uh,

251
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,934
跟我父母谈过吗?
talk to my parents at all?

252
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,173
你他妈在这干什么，苏苏?
What the fuck are you doing here, soph?

253
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,409
我错过了你。
I missed you.

254
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:04,311
我们都知道那是个谎言。
We both know that's a lie.

255
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:05,946
没有人想过我。
Nobody's ever missed me.

256
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,559
啊,不!请,不!
Ugh, no! Please, no!

257
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:57,965
天啊，你能把那个关了吗?
Ugh, my god, can you turn that off?

258
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,333
它让我心烦意乱。
It's bumming me out.

259
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:02,504
是的。你是对的。你是对的。
Yeah. You're right. You're right.

260
00:15:02,537 --> 00:15:05,305
嘿，伙计们，我能…我能用上Wi-Fi吗?
Hey, guys, can I... Can I get on the Wi-Fi?

261
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,975
天啊，我总是记不住密码。
Oh, god, I can never remember the password.

262
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,177
这是一个很好的密码。
It's, like, an actually good password.

263
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,930
乔丹:我把它转过去。你的电子邮件是什么?
Jordan: I'll transfer it. What's your email?

264
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,047
蜜蜂:嗯…什么?
Bee: Uh... what?

265
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,650
你的电子邮件是什么?
What is your email?

266
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,453
嘿…
Hey...

267
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,457
我很抱歉。我的服务中断了，
I'm sorry. My service went out,

268
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,292
但我现在用的是Wi-Fi。
but I am on a Wi-Fi now.

269
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:28,162
所以,这很好。
So, that's good.

270
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:30,665
格雷格:我百分百想做抖音。你们都能做到。
Greg: I 100% wanna do a tiktok. All of you can do it.

271
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:33,535
好的。你知道这个吗?是哪一个?
Okay. Do you know this? Which one is it?

272
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:36,179
格雷格:我不知道我在做什么。
Greg: I don't know what I'm doing.

273
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:37,481
艾丽斯:遵循…我们会看…
Alice: Follow... We'll watch it...

274
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:39,106
你会赶上的。是的。
You'll catch it. Yeah.

275
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:42,176
好，准备，三，二…
Okay, ready, three, two...

276
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,211
埃玛:跟上，跟上。
Emma: Keep up, keep up.

277
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:45,713
乔丹:走吧!埃玛:看看你。
Jordan: Go! Emma: Look at you.

278
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:50,785
我们说到最后一部分了吗?
Are we at the last part?

279
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:52,754
乔丹:很好。这是好的。好的。
Jordan: That was good. That was good. Okay.

280
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:55,322
格雷格有点不听话，但我们正在检查他的动作。
Greg went a little rogue but we're checking the moves.

281
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,458
爱丽丝:不，你没有。再一次,再一次,再一次。
Alice: No, you didn't. Again, again, again.

282
00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:58,769
埃玛:最后是这样。
Emma: At the end you go like this.

283
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:00,595
艾丽斯:准备好了吗?做好准备。你没事吧?
Alice: Ready? Get ready. You okay?

284
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:02,530
乔丹:我们应该把它贴出来。
Jordan: We should just, just post it.

285
00:16:02,564 --> 00:16:03,497
爱丽丝:非常好。
Alice: It's very good.

286
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:05,175
乔丹:我准备好了。一次!
Jordan: I'm ready for the flow. One more time!

287
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,300
三，二，一，开始!
Three, two, one, go!

288
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,602
你想喝点什么吗?
Do you want a drink?

289
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:08,703
你想要点什么吗?
Do you want something?

290
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:10,270
给你。我们走吧!
Here you go. There we go!

291
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:13,140
她玩得很开心。
She's having a good time.

292
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,241
我们走吧!
Let's go!

293
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:16,644
是啊!哦,我的上帝。
Yeah! Oh, my god.

294
00:16:16,678 --> 00:16:18,111
好吧,婊子。
Okay, bitch.

295
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:20,748
爱丽丝:我做得很咸。
Alice: I make it very salty.

296
00:16:20,782 --> 00:16:22,216
这是令人难以置信的咸。

394
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:42,717
爱丽丝:你最后总是哭。
Alice: You always end up crying.

395
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,653
好吧，我可以很容易地感知自己的情绪。
Okay, I can access my emotions easily.

396
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:47,421
非常容易。
Alice: Very incredibly easily.

397
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:49,322
她是个演员，她总是先哭。
She's an actress, she always cries first.

398
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:53,528
我只是说，这个游戏会变得很丑陋。

It gets ugly when she ugly cries.

401
00:19:57,665 --> 00:19:59,634
艾玛:真的，每次我们玩的时候，
Emma: Literally, every single time we play,

402
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:00,668

Oh, Jesus...

407
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:20,021
那么，你是怎么玩的?
So, how do you play?

408
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:22,924
苏菲:我马上要关灯了。
Sophie: So, I'm gonna hit the lights in a second.

409
00:20:22,957 --> 00:20:24,559
如果你是凶手
And if you are the murderer,

410
00:20:24,592 --> 00:20:26,994
你得偷偷摸摸地去杀人
you have to sneak around and kill someone

411
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:29,362
比如摸他们的后背。
by, like, touching them on the back.

412
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:32,967
然后，其他所有人都要避免被杀死。
And then, everyone else has to avoid being killed.

413
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,836
然后，如果你被杀了
And then, if you are killed,

414
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:38,039
你得倒下去假装自己死了。
you have to fall down and pretend you're dead.

415
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:39,607
艾丽斯:是这样的。
Alice: Like this.

416
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,676
格雷格:酷。
Greg: Cool.

417
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:43,678

Hey, uh... Alice, do you wanna...

418

What? David: Do you wanna...

419
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,248
你知道的。哦!对不起，我得走了。
You know. Oh! Excuse me, I have to go.

420
00:20:48,683 --> 00:20:49,951
这是一个紧急情况。
It's an emergency.

421
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:52,587
原谅我。
Excuse me.

422
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,764
乔丹:最重要的部分
Jordan: The most important part

423
00:20:53,788 --> 00:20:55,757
如果你发现了一具尸体
is if you do come across a body,

424
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,725
你得喊"尸体，尸体，尸体"
you have to yell, "bodies, bodies, bodies."

425
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:58,960
一旦发生这种情况，
And then, once that happens,

426
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:00,327
我们把灯都打开
we'll turn all the lights back on

427
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,663
然后我们会试着找出是谁干的。
and then we'll try to figure out who did it.

428
00:21:02,697 --> 00:21:03,998
你能拿一下这个吗?
Could you hold this?

429
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:05,600
格雷格碰过那个吗?
Did Greg touch that?

430
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:06,667
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my god.

431
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:08,603
你对格雷格的态度太混蛋了。
You're being such a dick about Greg.

432
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:10,037
,就拿着这个。
Just hold this.

433
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:13,340
大卫……
David...

434
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,942
什么?我,呃……
What? I, ugh...

435
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:21,783
好吧……
Okay...

436
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:25,520
听着，到底怎么回事?
Look, what the fuck's going on?

437
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:26,954
苏菲:到地板上来。
Sophie: Come to the floor.

438
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:28,022
到地板上来。
Come to the floor.

439
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:30,024
乔丹:给我滚过来，小子。
Jordan: Get your ass over here, boy.

440
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:34,427
索菲:好的。好吧。
Sophie: Okay. All right.

441
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:35,663
乔丹:谁来主持呢?
Jordan: Who will do the honors?

442
00:21:36,531 --> 00:21:37,865
哦……
Oh...

443
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:40,300
进入它。我们走吧。
Get into it. Let's go.

444
00:21:41,068 --> 00:21:42,402
乔丹:噢!
Jordan: Ow!

445
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,939
啊!
Ahhh!

446
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,841
婊子。
Bitch.

447
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:47,909
爱丽丝:你生我气了吗?
Alice: Are you mad at me?

448
00:21:47,942 --> 00:21:49,222
乔丹:没有。艾丽斯:好吧。
Jordan: No. Alice: Okay.

449
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:52,379
蜜蜂:噢!艾丽斯:乔丹!
Bee: Ow! Alice: Jordan!

450
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:53,748
苏菲:哇。什么?这是游戏。
Sophie: Whoa. What? It's the game.

451
00:21:53,781 --> 00:21:55,016
大卫:Wowza……
David: Wowza...

452
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,136
哦,我的上帝…哦,来吧!
Oh, my god... Oh, come on!

453
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:16,403
那是什么?蜜蜂!
What was that? Bee!

454
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:17,446
你必须多击球。你得把
You have to hit more. You got to put

455
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,507
加点肌肉进去。你必须…是的，去吧。
some muscle into it. You gotta... Yeah, go for it.

456
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,541
是的。
Yeah.

457
00:22:22,076 --> 00:22:23,410
来吧!
Come on!

458
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:24,521
乔丹:打他，他活该。
Jordan: Slap him around, he deserves it.

459
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:25,513
大卫:打我!
David: Fucking hit me!

460
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:27,615
埃玛:他想要。乔丹:不，他活该。
Emma: He wants it. Jordan: No, he deserves it.

461
00:22:27,648 --> 00:22:28,583
这是他应得的。这样做。
He really deserves it. Do it.

462
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:29,993
如果有人该挨打，也应该是他。
If anyone deserves to be hit, it should be him.

463
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:31,853
是的。蜜蜂:好的。
Yeah. Bee: Okay.

464
00:22:31,886 --> 00:22:33,554
看在上帝的份上。
Oh, for fuck sake like this.

465
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:35,122
爱丽丝:哦，天哪!
Alice: Oh, my god!

466
00:22:35,156 --> 00:22:36,991
乔丹:大卫!大卫。
Jordan: David! David.

467
00:22:38,593 --> 00:22:39,894
看到了吗?大卫。
See? David.

468
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:43,598
你这个混蛋!
You're a fucking dick!

469
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:45,099
什么?
What?

470
00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:46,834
你真是个混蛋。
You are such an asshole.

471
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:48,011
我在教她怎么玩这个游戏。
I'm teaching her how to play the game.

472
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:49,469
宝贝，停，停!
Alice: Baby, stop, stop!

473
00:22:49,503 --> 00:22:51,505
等等，伙计们，总得有人打我。
Wait, guys, someone has to hit me.

474
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,074
谁会打我?
Who's gonna hit me?

475
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:54,374
乔丹:我来吧。
Jordan: I'll do it.

476
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:57,477
埃玛:噢!
Emma: Ow!

477
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,413
谢谢你！乔丹:你是受欢迎的。
Thank you. Jordan: You're welcome.

478
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:01,448
索菲:好的!
Sophie: Okay!

479
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,483
我们准备好出发了吗?是的，我们他妈的走吧。
Are we ready to go? Alice: Yes, let's fucking go.

480
00:23:03,517 --> 00:23:05,037
大卫:是的。爱丽丝:我们来玩游戏吧。
David: Yes. Alice: Let's play the game.

481
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:17,798
大卫:天啊!我太操蛋了。
David: Holy shit! I'm so fucked up.

482
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:42,924
啊。
Ahh.

483
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:48,663
你准备好了吗?
You ready?

484
00:23:48,863 --> 00:23:50,031
是的。
Yes.

485
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,808
蜜蜂:嘿。
Bee: Hey.

486
00:25:04,205 --> 00:25:05,906
哦!
Oh!

487
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:21,689
苏菲:我看到白人……
Sophie: I see white man...

488
00:25:21,722 --> 00:25:23,290
尸体,尸体,尸体!
Bodies, bodies, bodies!

489
00:25:26,227 --> 00:25:30,264
你们!在这里。
You guys! Over here.

490
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:35,069
不!
No!

491
00:25:35,102 --> 00:25:36,904
乔丹:好吧，谁想占我便宜
Jordan: All right, who tried to take advantage

492
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:38,739
我的身体在黑暗中?
of my body in the dark?

493
00:25:38,773 --> 00:25:40,207
你的愿望,宝贝。
Your wish, babe.

494
00:25:40,241 --> 00:25:43,978
爱丽丝:哦，为什么，天哪?为什么?他太性感了!
Alice: Oh, why, god? Why? He was so hot!

495
00:25:44,945 --> 00:25:46,881
是你吗?不。
Was it you? No.

496
00:25:46,914 --> 00:25:49,750
好的。那么，我们有提名吗?
Okay. So, do we have any nominations?

497
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:51,252
大卫:艾玛哇。
David: Emma whoa.

498
00:25:51,285 --> 00:25:53,254
哇，快来了。什么?
Wow, coming in hot. What?

499
00:25:53,287 --> 00:25:55,890
为什么?是的，我想是艾玛。
Why? Yup, I think it was Emma.

500
00:25:55,923 --> 00:25:57,691
你为什么觉得是我?
Why do you think it was me?

501
00:25:57,725 --> 00:25:58,893
是的，大卫，怎么了?
Alice: Yeah, David, why?

502
00:25:58,926 --> 00:26:00,361
好吧，她就像，
David: Okay, well, she just, like,

503
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:03,097
赞同所有人所说的一切。
agrees with everything that everybody is saying.

504
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,299
这就是她在这个游戏中的策略
And that's her strategy in this game

505
00:26:05,332 --> 00:26:07,001
而且每次都很有效。
and it works every single time.

506
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:08,669
我现在调用它。艾玛。
So, I'm just calling it now. It's Emma.

507
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:10,638
我们还有其他提名吗?
Sophie: Do we have any other nominations?

508
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:12,807
嗯…是的,大卫。
Um... yeah, David.

509
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,351
大卫:哦，得了吧。这是唾手可得的果实。
David: Oh, come on. It's low hanging fruit.

510
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:16,077
我是说，他是第一个扔石头的人。
I mean, he who casts the first stone.

511
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,845
比:伙计们，他为什么不动?
Bee: Guys, why isn't he moving?

512
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,183
格雷格?宝贝,起床了。
Greg? Baby, get up.

513
00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:24,985
你没必要假装这么久。
You don't have to keep pretending for this long.

514
00:26:25,886 --> 00:26:27,621
宝贝?来吧,格雷格。
Baby? Come on, Greg.

515
00:26:27,655 --> 00:26:28,656
艾丽斯:格雷格……
Alice: Greg...

516
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,191
格雷格……
Greg...

517
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:32,226
起床了。
Get up.

518
00:26:33,094 --> 00:26:34,161
等待。
Wait.

519
00:26:38,132 --> 00:26:39,166
格雷格?
Greg?

520
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:41,902
格雷格!
Greg!

521
00:26:41,936 --> 00:26:43,404
格雷格,起来!
Greg, get up!

522
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:44,839
格雷格!他不起来了。
Greg! He's not getting up.

523
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:47,208
放松点，这招总是管用的。我知道。
Hey, relax, this always works. I know.

524
00:26:47,241 --> 00:26:49,844
哦,嘿!哦,我的上帝。
Oh, hey! Oh, my god.

525
00:26:49,877 --> 00:26:52,847
你真的吓到我了。
You really scared me with that.

526
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:55,950
埃玛:格雷格，你真是个小骗子。
Emma: You're a little trickster, Greg.

527
00:26:55,983 --> 00:26:57,651
乔丹:我知道，上帝啊。
Jordan: I know, Jesus Christ.

528
00:26:57,685 --> 00:26:59,720
苏菲:可爱。
Sophie: Cute.

529
00:26:59,753 --> 00:27:02,423
好吧,所以…大卫呢?
Okay, so... what about David?

530
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:03,724
艾丽斯:
Alice:

531
00:27:03,757 --> 00:27:05,226
等等，也许是乔丹。
Wait, maybe it's Jordan.

532
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:07,337
当她是凶手时，她总是很有攻击性。
She's always really aggressive when she's the killer.

533
00:27:07,361 --> 00:27:08,729
那就这样吧。什么?不，我不是。
There you go. What? No, I am not.

534
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:09,730
你就是在说谎。
You're lying.

535
00:27:09,763 --> 00:27:11,732
你撒谎的时候声音总是很高。
Your voice always goes really high when you lie.

536
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:13,734
不,它不是。我…它……我已经……
No, it doesn't. I... it... I've...

537
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:15,803
这绝对是大卫。你喊什么?
It's definitely David. Why are you yelling?

538
00:27:15,836 --> 00:27:17,013
那就太明显了
That would be so fucking obvious

539
00:27:17,037 --> 00:27:18,839
如果我是凶手，但我不是
if I were the killer, which I'm not.

540
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:19,983
我觉得你在自掘坟墓
I think you're digging yourself

541
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:21,442
塞进一个小洞里，戴夫。
into a little hole here, Dave.

542
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:24,078
大卫:伙计们，上帝啊……
David: Guys, Jesus Christ...

543
00:27:24,111 --> 00:27:25,946
最好的防守是有力的进攻。
The best defense is a good offense.

544
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,257
嘿，你闭嘴。你不应该说话。你死了。
Hey, you shut up. You're not supposed to talk. You're dead.

545
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:28,358
死人是不应该说话的。
The dead are actually not supposed to speak.

546
00:27:28,382 --> 00:27:30,160
哦,是的,你……对不起，宝贝，你不能。这是一个规则。
Oh, yeah, you... sorry, baby, you can't. It's a rule.

547
00:27:30,184 --> 00:27:32,219
哦，我的。是啊，别说话。住嘴。
Oh, my b. Yeah, no talking. Pack it up.

548
00:27:32,253 --> 00:27:34,093
大卫:那是什么意思，格雷格?
David: What the fuck does that even mean, Greg?

549
00:27:34,121 --> 00:27:35,756
有什么事吗?
What's up?

550
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:37,791
“最好的防守就是良好的进攻。”
"The best defense is a good offense."

551
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:39,793
那是什么……这是什么意思?
What does that... What does that mean?

552
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:43,030
要知道，最好的防守就是进攻。
Oh, you know, the best defense is a good offense.

553
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:48,169
什么……这是什么意思呢?
What... What does it mean, though?

554
00:27:50,204 --> 00:27:51,972
嗯,嗯…
Uh, well...

555
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:55,276
,嗯…这意味着最好的防御
It, um... it means that the best defense

556
00:27:56,377 --> 00:27:58,045
是很好的进攻。
is a good offense.

557
00:27:58,078 --> 00:28:00,114
对，对，我听到了。
Right, right, I heard you.

558
00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:03,450
但是，这对你意味着什么，格雷格?喜欢……
But, what does it mean to you, Greg? Like...

559
00:28:03,484 --> 00:28:06,287
我不知道，你能详细说明一下吗?
I don't know, could you elaborate on it for us?

560
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,821
分解它。
Break it down.

561
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:09,323
是的,当然。
Yeah, sure.

562
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:11,792
嘿，看体育界，有…
So, hey, look in sports, there's...

563
00:28:13,127 --> 00:28:14,161
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my god.

564
00:28:14,195 --> 00:28:15,796
你真是个混蛋。
You are such a fucking dick.

565
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:17,198
嘿，这是个教育的时刻。
Hey, this is a teaching moment.

566
00:28:21,135 --> 00:28:22,203
哦,我明白了。
Oh, I see.

567
00:28:23,304 --> 00:28:24,471
你在耍我。
You're fucking with me.

568
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:26,440
不。不,
No. No,

569
00:28:26,473 --> 00:28:27,908
我没跟你开玩笑，格雷格。
I'm not fucking with you, Greg.

570
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:30,144
我只是在玩。
I'm just having fun.

571
00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:32,379
我们都玩得很开心。
We're all just having a good time.

572
00:28:32,413 --> 00:28:33,781
对不对?
Right, guys?

573
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:35,716
格雷格?
Right, Greg?

574
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:46,427
我们只是在玩。
We're just having fun.

575
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:00,407
你知道的,
You know,

576
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:02,876
我想我该去睡觉了。
I think it's time for me to put myself to bed.

577
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,879
乔丹:哦，得了吧，格雷格。艾丽斯:格雷格,没有。
Jordan: Oh, come on, Greg. Alice: Greg, no.

578
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:07,248
晚安,格雷格。
Good night, Greg.

579
00:29:07,948 --> 00:29:09,083
你们玩得开心。
You kids have fun.

580
00:29:09,116 --> 00:29:10,784
回头见，玩家。
Sophie: Catch you later, player.

581
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:11,919
大卫:顺便说一下，
David: By the way,

582
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:13,821
我能让大家注意一下吗
can I just point all of our attention

583
00:29:13,854 --> 00:29:16,223
艾玛什么都没说
to the fact that Emma hasn't said a fucking word.

584
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:19,460
哇，你说得对。
Alice: Whoa, you're right.

585
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:20,528
哇,她没有!
Whoa, she hasn't!

586
00:29:20,562 --> 00:29:23,063
大卫:我只是指出了显而易见的事实。这是所有。
David: I'm just pointing out the obvious. That's all.

587
00:29:23,097 --> 00:29:24,865
看，她在做吞咽动作。
Look, she's doing that swallowing thing.

588
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:26,309
她一紧张就这么干!
She always does that when she's fucking nervous!

589
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:27,344
爱丽丝:哦，天哪!快看,快看!
Alice: Oh, my god! Look, look!

590
00:29:27,368 --> 00:29:29,870
我的天，你做到了。你吞下它。
Oh, my god, you're doing it. You're swallowing it.

591
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:31,839
我不是。艾丽斯:你。
I'm not. Alice: You are.

592
00:29:31,872 --> 00:29:33,508
好吧，我爱你，但你咽下去的时候，
Okay, I love you, but when you swallow,

593
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:35,009
只是他妈的……喜欢,为什么?
it's just fucking... Like, why?

594
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:36,243
吞咽是正常的。
Swallowing is normal.

595
00:29:36,277 --> 00:29:37,387
这是很正常的事。大卫:是的……
It's a normal thing to do. David: Yeah...

596
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:39,322
它非常UN-attractive。我不知道你为什么这么做?
It's very UN-attractive. I don't know why you do it?

597
00:29:39,346 --> 00:29:42,816
哦,我的上帝。所以你们才从来不做爱吗?
Oh, my god. Is that why you guys never have sex?

598
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,952
什么?爱丽丝。
What? Alice.

599
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:49,089
什么?这不是一件坏事。有些人经常做爱。
What? It's not a bad thing. Some people have sex a lot.

600
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:50,057
有些人更少。
Some people have it less.

601
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,960
爱丽丝，你在说什么?我们所做的。
Alice, what are you talking about? We do.

602
00:29:52,993 --> 00:29:54,895
我有很多。一些……
I have it a lot. Some...

603
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:56,206
你他妈的…苏菲:哦，天哪。
Are you fucking... Sophie: Oh, my god.

604
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,110
你他妈是在背着我说我们吗?
Are you fucking talking about us behind my back?

605
00:29:59,033 --> 00:30:00,568
不。是的。
No. Yes.

606
00:30:00,602 --> 00:30:01,902
艾玛:没有。是的。
Emma: No. Yes.

607
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,004
不,我不是。
No, I'm not.

608
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:05,239
我不是!我不是。
I'm not! I'm not.

609
00:30:05,272 --> 00:30:06,283
我只是…大卫:那太好了。
I just... David: That's just great.

610
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:09,943
艾玛:不,我……我们……我…你从来没有真正…我…
Emma: No, I... we... I... you never really... I...

611
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:11,879
我不…你总是在欺骗我。
I don't... You're always gaslighting me.

612
00:30:11,912 --> 00:30:13,524
“煤气灯,闭嘴。这个词太蠢了。
"Gaslight," shut up. It's a fucking dumb word.

613
00:30:13,548 --> 00:30:14,716
原谅我吗?
Excuse me?

614
00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:17,351
煤气灯是最常被使用的词之一，
Gaslight is, like, one of the most over used words ever,

615
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:19,587
就像，到了毁灭的地步。
to, like, the point of annihilation.

616
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:22,022
好吧，这只是事实而已
Okay, it doesn't mean anything other than the fact

617
00:30:22,056 --> 00:30:23,525
比如，你在网上阅读。
that, like, you read the Internet.

618
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:26,026
或者，“恭喜你，你有推特账号了。”
Or, like, "congrats, you have a Twitter account."

619
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,195
这他妈太逊了。
Ugh, that is so fucking lame.

620
00:30:28,228 --> 00:30:29,306
大卫:“煤气灯”，算了吧。
David: "Gaslight," get over it.

621
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:32,132
下一个是什么?你要叫我自恋狂?
Like what's next? You're gonna call me a narcissist?

622
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,968
还是白人至上主义的小兵?
Or a foot soldier of, like, the white supremacy?

623
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:37,004
就像，来吧，他妈的，更原创一点。
Like, come on, fucking, be more original.

624
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:38,272
苏菲:跛。
Sophie: Lame.

625
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:39,316
大卫:什么?我只是说，这就是我要说的，
David: What? I'm just saying, that, this is what I'm saying,

626
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,084
她他妈脑子里一点想法都没有
she doesn't have a thought in her fucking head

627
00:30:41,108 --> 00:30:43,911
其他人没这么说过。
that hasn't been said by anybody else.

628
00:30:43,944 --> 00:30:45,580
没有什么不是命中注定的。
Nothing that isn't preordained.

629
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:49,149
爱丽丝:大卫，你太刻薄了。
Alice: David, that's really mean.

630
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:50,884
看,她在哭。
Look, she's crying.

631
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:52,086
大卫:什么?
David: What?

632
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,296
为什么大家都那样看着我?
Why is everybody looking at me like that?

633
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,255
这不是她真正的哭声。
This is not her real cry.

634
00:30:57,424 --> 00:30:58,425
大卫我投票。
I vote David.

635
00:30:59,393 --> 00:31:00,928
是的,我也是。
Yeah, me too.

636
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:02,630
你他妈说真的吗?
Are you fucking serious?

637
00:31:02,664 --> 00:31:03,964
伙计们,这是艾玛。
Guys, it's Emma.

638
00:31:03,997 --> 00:31:06,501
她是一个女演员。她的表演。
She's an actress. She's acting.

639
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:08,302
第三。
Third.

640
00:31:08,335 --> 00:31:10,237
大卫:哇，真他妈令人惊讶。
David: Wow, how fucking surprising.

641
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,206
看你颤抖的上嘴唇。
Yeah, look at your quivering upper lip.

642
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:14,375
就像，我们都没在《海达·盖博勒》里见过你。< / i >去你妈的。
Like, we all didn't see you in <i>hedda gabler.</i> Fuck you.

643
00:31:14,408 --> 00:31:16,176
是的,是的,是的……第四。
Yeah, yeah, yup... fourth.

644
00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:20,615
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my god.

645
00:31:20,648 --> 00:31:22,015
他妈的这个游戏!
Fuck this game!

646
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:27,054
艾丽斯:天啊。
Alice: Holy shit.

647
00:31:29,022 --> 00:31:31,392
人际关系真的很复杂。
Relationships can be really complicated.

648
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:36,196
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

649
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,599
我很好。你确定吗?
I'm fine. Are you sure?

650
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:40,134
我很好。我100%罚款。你确定吗，宝贝?
I'm fine. I'm 100% fine. Are you sure, baby?

651
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,636
是的。让我们玩。
Yes. Let's play.

652
00:31:42,403 --> 00:31:43,538
噢!
Ow!

653
00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:46,206
爱丽丝:哇，不错。
Alice: Wow, good one.

654
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,176
乔丹:她突然喜欢上这项运动了。
Jordan: All of a sudden she loves the game.

655
00:31:49,209 --> 00:31:51,378
爱丽丝:太疯狂了。
Alice: That was crazy.

656
00:31:53,715 --> 00:31:54,915
把它给我。
Give it to me.

657
00:31:57,217 --> 00:31:58,318
乔丹:该死的!
Jordan: Damn!

658
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,589
艾丽斯:啊!哦,我的上帝!
Alice: Ah! Oh, my god!

659
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:02,657
埃玛:那是什么?
Emma: What was that?

660
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,434
爱丽丝:搞什么鬼?乔丹:是灯的问题吗?
Alice: What the fuck? Jordan: Is that the lights?

661
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:05,492
埃玛:那是什么?
Emma: What was that?

662
00:32:05,527 --> 00:32:06,493
苏菲:哦，天哪。埃玛:是暴风雨造成的吗?
Sophie: Oh, my god. Emma: Was that from the storm?

663
00:32:06,528 --> 00:32:08,530
苏菲:哦，天哪。我打赌是大卫干的。
Sophie: Oh, my god. I bet you that it was David.

664
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:10,264
大卫!乔丹:不是大卫。来吧。
David! Jordan: It's not David. Come on.

665
00:32:10,297 --> 00:32:11,331
我发短信他。
I'm texting him.

666
00:32:11,365 --> 00:32:13,233
大卫，你在耍我们吗?
David, are you fucking with us?

667
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:14,736
把灯打开。
Turn the lights back on.

668
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:16,538
嘿，有人有电话吗?
Hey, does anybody have service?

669
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:17,639
不!
No!

670
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:19,306
等等，我的坏了。
Ugh, wait, mine's not working.

671
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:21,141
好吧，我想WiFi也坏了。
Okay, I think the WiFi is also down.

672
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:23,444
天啊，我要杀了他。
Oh, my god, i'm gonna fucking kill him.

673
00:32:23,477 --> 00:32:26,079
太棒了!大卫!
Great! David!

674
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:28,516
大卫!这真是太他妈可爱了!
David! This is real fucking cute!

675
00:32:31,452 --> 00:32:33,597
乔丹:索菲，他能把车库的发电机关掉吗?
Jordan: Soph, can he disable the generator from garage,

676
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:35,523
或者地下室，或者其他什么地方?
or the basement, or whatever?

677
00:32:35,557 --> 00:32:37,559
我不知道。
I don't know.

678
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,094
大卫!
David!

679
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:44,264
好吧，我去打开断路器。
Okay, well, I'm gonna go and flip the breaker.

680
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:46,009
它在车库还是在地下室?
Is it in the garage or is it in the basement?

681
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:47,234
大卫!乔丹:大学二年级生?
David! Jordan: Soph?

682
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:48,479
啊,什么?乔丹:好的,等等。
Huh, what? Jordan: Okay, whatever.

683
00:32:48,503 --> 00:32:50,505
好了，我再去拿些手电筒。
Okay, I'm gonna go get some more flashlights.

684
00:32:50,538 --> 00:32:52,272
埃玛:我要去洗手间。
Emma: I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

685
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:53,307
洗手间在哪里?
Where is a bathroom?

686
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,410
在楼下，右手边第一个门。
Um, uh, downstairs, first door on your right.

687
00:32:57,244 --> 00:32:58,345
蜜蜂:去那里。
Bee: Going there.

688
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:04,485
苏菲:大卫吗?
Sophie: David?

689
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:11,124
大卫，你在耍我们吗?
David, are you fucking with us?

690
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,790
我是说另一个楼梯。
I meant the other stairs.

691
00:34:21,763 --> 00:34:23,831
大卫!大卫!
David! David!

692
00:34:26,768 --> 00:34:29,403
的帮助!别人的帮助!
Help! Somebody help!

693
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:31,839
不,不,不。
No, no, no.

694
00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:33,641
爱丽丝:到底发生了什么事?
Alice: What the fuck happened?

695
00:34:33,675 --> 00:34:36,410
哦,我的上帝!为什么会……
Oh, my god! Why would...

696
00:34:36,443 --> 00:34:38,813
乔丹:检查他的脉搏。搞什么鬼?
Jordan: Check his pulse. Sophie: What the fuck?

697
00:34:38,846 --> 00:34:40,748
乔丹:哦,他妈的!哦,我的上帝!
Jordan: Oh, fuck! Oh, my god!

698
00:34:40,782 --> 00:34:41,849
把他的头抬起来!
Hold his head up!

699
00:34:42,684 --> 00:34:44,552
哦,我的上帝!他妈的!
Oh, my god! Fuck!

700
00:34:44,586 --> 00:34:46,888
他妈的!爱丽丝:他要死了吗?

00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:49,323
把他的头抬起来!艾玛:来吧，宝贝，坚持住。
Hold his head up! Emma: Come on, baby, hold on.

702
00:34:49,356 --> 00:34:50,868
他的脖子怎么了?
Sophie: What the fuck happened to his neck?

703
00:34:50,892 --> 00:34:52,560
我爱你，大卫。大便。
I love you, David. Shit.

704
00:34:52,594 --> 00:34:54,529
爱丽丝:发生什么事了?
Alice: What is happening?

705
00:34:56,229 --> 00:34:57,799
狗屎!
Shit!

706
00:34:57,832 --> 00:34:59,534
爱丽丝:你在做什么?我打电话911 !
Alice: What are you doing? I'm calling 911!

707
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:00,735
哦,我的上帝!你有服务吗?
Oh, my god! You have service?

708
00:35:00,768 --> 00:35:02,269

你要去哪里?固定电话!
Where are you going? Landline!

711
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:06,774
我们要转移他的尸体吗?
We should move his body?

712
00:35:06,808 --> 00:35:09,242
为什么?我不知道。因为他是……
Why? I don't know. Because he's...

713
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:10,477
爱丽丝:不，你不能移动他。
Alice: No, you can't move him.

714
00:35:10,511 --> 00:35:12,279
你看<我>svu >了吗?< / i >的证据。
Did you watch <i>svu?</i> It's evidence.

715
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:15,349

Of what? Alice: Cause!

固定电话?不，没有联系。
Landline? No, there's no connection.

717
00:35:17,351 --> 00:35:19,152

I'm going to the car. Alice: To the car? Why?

723
00:35:26,728 --> 00:35:28,295
去找人帮忙。
To get some fucking help.

724
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:29,697
等等，你有驾照吗?
Wait, do you have a license?

725
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:31,164
她没有驾照吗?
Doesn't she not have a license?

726
00:35:31,198 --> 00:35:32,700
我不知道。我不这么想。
I don't know. I don't think so.

727
00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:34,569
艾丽斯:他妈的!蜜蜂:他死了!
Alice: Fuck! Bee: He's dead!

728
00:35:34,602 --> 00:35:36,336
你必须离开!我不知道!
You have to go! I don't know!

729
00:35:36,904 --> 00:35:38,640
他停止了呼吸!
He stopped breathing!

730
00:36:02,563 --> 00:36:03,698
乔丹:分支!
Jordan: Branch!

731
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:27,622
爱丽丝:你得推一下油门。
Alice: You have to push the gas.

732
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:29,757
乔丹:我知道怎么开车，爱丽丝!
Jordan: I know how to fucking drive, Alice!

733
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:31,626
我看不到。乔丹:电池没电了吗?
I can't see. Jordan: Is the battery dead?

734
00:36:32,794 --> 00:36:35,228
蜜蜂:噢,不…乔丹:什么?
Bee: Oh, no... Jordan: What?

735
00:36:35,262 --> 00:36:37,665
我，我想我把灯留在镜子上了。
I, I think I left the light on, on the mirror.

736
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:40,467
哦，上帝啊。
Alice: Oh, Jesus Christ.

737
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:42,269
我们他妈该怎么办?
Emma: What the fuck are we supposed to do?

738
00:36:42,302 --> 00:36:43,805
蜜蜂:等等，你的车呢?
Bee: Wait, where are your cars?

739
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:45,540
爱丽丝:我们……我们只有一辆车。
Alice: We... We only have one car.

740
00:36:45,573 --> 00:36:48,275
麦克斯把我们都接走了，然后就走了!
Max picked us all up and he fucking left!

741
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:51,713
乔丹:操，操，操!
Jordan: Fuck, fuck, fuck!

742
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:05,325
麦克斯随时都可能来，对吧?
Max will probably be here any minute, right?

743
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:06,460
约旦在哪里?
Where's Jordan?

744
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:09,797
她去检查发电机，我…
She went to check the generator, I...

745
00:37:10,698 --> 00:37:12,900
他到底在干什么?
What the fuck was he doing?

746
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:14,978
你在说什么?他在干什么?
What are you talking about? Sophie: Fuck was he doing?

747
00:37:15,002 --> 00:37:17,605
他他妈为什么在暴风雨里在外面?
Why the fuck was he outside in the storm?

748
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,716
乔丹:嘿!是我，让我进去!
Jordan: Hey! It's me, let me in!

749
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:37,892
我发现这一点。
I found this.

750
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,628
在外面的泥里。
Outside in the mud.

751
00:37:47,835 --> 00:37:48,936
苏菲:别碰它
Sophie: Don't touch it

752
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:51,739
如果停电了安保系统还能用吗?
um, does the security system work if the power goes out?

753
00:37:51,773 --> 00:37:53,473
嗯…
Um...

754
00:37:53,508 --> 00:37:55,977
是啊，是啊，是啊。
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it does.

755
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,477
大卫的爸爸向我们解释过。
David's dad explained it to us.

756
00:37:57,512 --> 00:37:58,622
没有密码谁也进不去。
Nobody can get in without the code.

757
00:37:58,646 --> 00:37:59,814
麦克斯有密码。
Well, Max has the code.

758
00:38:00,615 --> 00:38:01,816
所以…马克斯不会…
So... Max wouldn't...

759
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:04,852
我只是想问，他到底在哪?
I'm just saying, like, where the fuck is he?

760
00:38:04,886 --> 00:38:06,721
昨晚之后他不会回来了吧?
Couldn't he have come back after last night?

761
00:38:06,754 --> 00:38:08,321
爱丽丝,停止。
Alice, stop.

762
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:12,860
昨晚发生了什么事?
What happened last night?

763
00:38:12,894 --> 00:38:14,461
没什么。艾丽斯:没有。
Nothing. Alice: No.

764
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:15,963
我们做了蘑菇
We did shrooms

765
00:38:15,997 --> 00:38:19,466
麦克斯告诉所有人他爱上了艾玛
and Max told everybody that he was in love with Emma.

766
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:21,769
大卫当时觉得很美，
Which David thought was beautiful in the moment,

767
00:38:21,803 --> 00:38:23,504
但也许不是今天。
but maybe not today.

768
00:38:23,538 --> 00:38:25,640
爱丽丝，这根本不重要。
Alice, that literally doesn't fucking matter at all.

769
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:28,341
格雷格在哪里?他在哪里?
Where is Greg? Where is he?

770
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,911
什么?乔丹:格雷格在哪里?
What? Jordan: Where is Greg?

771
00:38:29,944 --> 00:38:30,978
我…
I...

772
00:38:31,012 --> 00:38:32,647
他说他要去睡觉了。
He said he was going to bed.

773
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,381
所以我猜他在睡觉。
So my guess would be that he's sleeping.

774
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:35,759
好吧，你不觉得有点奇怪吗
Okay, don't you think it's a little bit strange

775
00:38:35,783 --> 00:38:37,652
他还没醒过来吗?
that he hasn't, like, woken up yet?

776
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:39,319
约旦,
Jordan,

777
00:38:40,054 --> 00:38:41,789
你想说什么?
what are you trying to say.

778
00:38:41,823 --> 00:38:43,390
也许我们该去看看他。
Maybe we should just go check on him.

779
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:44,659
爱丽丝:不，不，不。
Alice: No, no, no.

780
00:38:47,695 --> 00:38:48,830
乔丹……
Jordan...

781
00:38:48,863 --> 00:38:51,599
你在做什么?乔丹……乔丹。
What are you doing? Jordan... Jordan.

782
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:52,767
你在干什么!
What are you doing!

783
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,101
我保持安全。艾丽斯:真的吗?
I'm staying safe. Alice: Really?

784
00:38:54,135 --> 00:38:55,212
因为看起来你在抓东西
Because it looks like you're grabbing

785
00:38:55,236 --> 00:38:57,505
拿把切肉刀去找我男朋友!
a fucking meat cleaver to go look for my boyfriend!

786
00:38:57,538 --> 00:38:59,106
哇。男朋友吗?
Wow. Boyfriend?

787
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,584
这是我第一次听你这么叫他。
That's the first time I've heard you call him that.

788
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,642
这太疯狂了。
That's crazy.

789
00:39:01,676 --> 00:39:02,820
爱丽丝:别这么泼辣。
Alice: Don't be such a bitch.

790
00:39:02,844 --> 00:39:05,022
乔丹:爱丽丝，我只是在保护自己，好吗?
Jordan: Alice, I'm literally just protecting myself, okay?

791
00:39:05,046 --> 00:39:07,815
提醒你一下，我们的朋友已经死了。
Let me remind you, our friend is dead.

792
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:10,127
所以，如果你能，不要把情况升级…
So, if you could just, like, not escalate the situation...

793
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:11,953
我不升级。你拿着刀
I'm not escalating. You're holding the knife

794
00:39:11,986 --> 00:39:13,497
你说话的时候还在动你的手。
and you're moving your hands while you talk.

795
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:15,323
爱丽丝，你认识格雷格多久了?
Alice, how long have you known Greg?

796
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:18,458
喜欢……
Like...

797
00:39:20,728 --> 00:39:21,829
长。
Long.

798
00:39:22,797 --> 00:39:23,831
爱丽丝。
Alice.

799
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:25,833
啊…
Ugh...

800
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:29,103
我不知道具体要多久。
I don't know exactly how long.

801
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:30,638
我…喜欢……
I... Like...

802
00:39:31,606 --> 00:39:32,640
两个星期。
Two weeks.

803
00:39:32,673 --> 00:39:33,808
乔丹:好吧,嗯…
Jordan: Okay, uh...

804
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:35,408
你对格雷格了解多少，爱丽丝?
What do you know about Greg, Alice?

805
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:36,476
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my god.

806
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,621
乔丹:你对他了解多少?
Jordan: What do you know about him?

807
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:38,880
天啊，伙计们!
Oh, my god, guys!

808
00:39:38,913 --> 00:39:39,990
苏菲:哦，天哪!放松。停!
Sophie: Oh, my god! Relax. Stop!

809
00:39:40,014 --> 00:39:42,550
停!停!我知道他是个好人，好吗?
Stop! Stop! I know that he's a good person, okay?

810
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:44,085
他本质上是个好人。
He's fundamentally a good person.

811
00:39:44,118 --> 00:39:45,653
他不会这么做的。喜欢,不。
He wouldn't do this. Like, no.

812
00:39:45,686 --> 00:39:47,664
你知道他的中间名吗?你知道他住在哪里吗?
Do you know his middle name? Do you know where he lives?

813
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:49,523
你知道他赚了多少钱吗?
Do you know how much fucking money he makes?

814
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:51,192
你知道他姓什么吗，爱丽丝?
Do you know his last name, Alice?

815
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:52,693
我知道很多。
I know a lot.

816
00:39:52,727 --> 00:39:55,062
我们的第一次约会是在……在酒吧。
Our first date was at... Was at a bar.

817
00:39:55,096 --> 00:39:56,864
他喝了大概中等量的酒…
He drank, like, a medium amount...

818
00:39:56,898 --> 00:39:58,008
乔丹:好吧,爱丽丝……停止。他喜欢大自然。
Jordan: Okay, Alice... stop. He likes nature.

819
00:39:58,032 --> 00:39:59,000
乔丹:他的中间名是什么?
Jordan: What is his middle name?

820
00:39:59,033 --> 00:39:59,934
他是天秤座的月亮。乔丹:他住在哪里?
He's a libra moon. Jordan: Where does he live?

821
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:01,011
你不问你的中间名是什么!
You don't ask what your middle name is!

822
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:03,938
好吧?很长一段时间。乔丹:哦……他妈的!
Okay? For a really long time. Jordan: Oh... fuck!

823
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:07,508
他是天秤座的月亮。这说明了很多!
He's a libra moon. That says a lot!

824
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:08,709
他妈的!
Fuck!

825
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:14,081
格雷格!嘘!
Greg! Shh!

826
00:40:14,115 --> 00:40:15,726
爱丽丝:什么?你刚说我们在找格雷格!
Alice: What? You just said we're looking for Greg!

827
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,827
好吧，别他妈的，爱丽丝…
Okay, well don't fucking, Alice...

828
00:40:16,851 --> 00:40:17,995
格雷格!你能到厨房来一趟吗?
Greg! Can you come into the kitchen?

829
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:19,086
我们需要你帮忙。
We need you for a second.

830
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,155
闭嘴。别朝我挥刀!
Shut up. Stop waving the knife at me!

831
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:22,523
他妈的。你让我…
Fuck. You're making me...

832
00:40:22,556 --> 00:40:24,058
停。停。格雷格!
Stop. Stop. Greg!

833
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:25,559
停。停下来。只是安静。
Stop. Just stop. Just be quiet.

834
00:40:25,593 --> 00:40:26,627
停。停止。
Stop. Stop.

835
00:40:26,661 --> 00:40:28,495
格雷格!不喜欢。放松。
Greg! Don't. Relax.

836
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:30,965
别抓我的嘴。放松。放松。放松。
Don't grab my mouth. Relax. Relax. Relax.

837
00:40:30,998 --> 00:40:32,667
你沉默我。哦,我的上帝。
You're silencing me. Oh, my god.

838
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,467
滚开。好了,停止。
Get the fuck off. Okay, stop.

839
00:40:34,502 --> 00:40:36,137
爱丽丝:别再那样抓我了。
Alice: Don't grab me like that again.

840
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,004
她拿着刀朝我冲过来。
And she came at me with a knife.

841
00:40:37,038 --> 00:40:39,006
乔丹:对不起……艾丽斯:后退。
Jordan: I'm sorry... Alice: Back off.

842
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,141
好的,巴克!
Okay, buck!

843
00:40:41,676 --> 00:40:42,743
等待,艾玛在哪儿?
Wait, where's Emma?

844
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:43,811
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my god.

845
00:40:58,793 --> 00:40:59,994
乔丹:艾玛?
Jordan: Emma?

846
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,565
艾玛?
Emma?

847
00:41:04,598 --> 00:41:05,933
伙计们,
Guys,

848
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:07,768
也许是艾玛干的
maybe Emma could have done it.

849
00:41:07,802 --> 00:41:08,912
她非常生大卫的气。
She was really pissed at David.

850
00:41:08,936 --> 00:41:10,013
爱丽丝，搞什么鬼?
Sophie: Alice, what the fuck?

851
00:41:10,037 --> 00:41:11,081
艾玛不会那么做的。
Sophie: Emma wouldn't do that.

852
00:41:11,105 --> 00:41:12,006
她极为震惊。
She was devastated.

853
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:14,041
她好像恐慌症发作了。
She's having, like, a full-on panic attack.

854
00:41:14,075 --> 00:41:15,676
是啊，但她是个演员。
Yeah, but she's an actress.

855
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,611
她的表演。记得<我>海达·高布乐吗?< / i >
She's acting. Remember <i>hedda gabler?</i>

856
00:41:17,645 --> 00:41:18,579
好吧，不是我刻薄
Okay, not to be mean,

857
00:41:18,612 --> 00:41:20,614
但是她在<i>hedda gabler.</i>
but she wasn't that good in <i>hedda gabler.</i>

858
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:39,166
这是我的房间。
This is my room.

859
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,568
所以打开它。
So open it.

860
00:41:41,669 --> 00:41:42,670
你打开它。
You open it.

861
00:41:42,703 --> 00:41:44,772
你不是说"格雷格不会这么做的"吗
What happened to, "Greg would never do this?"

862
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:46,741
他不会。好吧，打开它。
He wouldn't. Okay, so open it.

863
00:41:46,774 --> 00:41:48,175
我马上就会。
I will in one second.

864
00:41:48,976 --> 00:41:50,077
我要去。
I'm going to.

865
00:42:00,721 --> 00:42:01,989
他不在这里。
Sophie: He's not here.

866
00:42:04,658 --> 00:42:06,627
索菲，房子里有枪吗?
Soph, are there any guns in the house?

867
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,695
枪支?
Guns?

868
00:42:08,262 --> 00:42:09,397
不。不可能。
No. No way.

869
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,832
大卫的爸爸可能是个混蛋，但他的政治立场是对的。
David's dad can be a dick, but his politics check out.

870
00:42:24,812 --> 00:42:25,946
乔丹:男人…
Jordan: Guys...

871
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:33,087
这他妈是什么?
What the fuck is this?

872
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,259
嗯…但是…
Uh... but...

873
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:41,629
他想为飓风做好准备。他……
He wanted to be prepared for the hurricane. He...

874
00:42:45,132 --> 00:42:46,309
他为什么绕着房子转
Sophie: Why did he circle the fucking house

875
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:47,768
在他该死的地图上?
on his fucking map?

876
00:42:47,802 --> 00:42:49,522
乔丹:我们得在他之前找到艾玛。
Jordan: We have to find Emma before he does.

877
00:42:49,703 --> 00:42:50,805
索菲:好的。
Sophie: Okay.

878
00:42:54,909 --> 00:42:56,243
乔丹:接下来我们去我的房间看看。
Jordan: Let's check my room next.

879
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:32,179
乔丹:我不认为他藏在我的胸罩里。
Jordan: I don't think he's hiding in my bra.

880
00:43:34,915 --> 00:43:36,083

你还好吗?

埃玛:怎么了?你们在做什么?
Emma: What's going on? What are you guys doing?

886
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:02,042
你吓到我了发生什么事了?
You scared me what's happening?

887
00:44:03,177 --> 00:44:04,345
这里太热了。
It's so hot in here.

888
00:44:06,447 --> 00:44:07,381
那是什么?
What is that?

00:44:07,414 --> 00:44:09,350
阿普唑仑。你想要一个吗?对，给我一个。
Xanax. Do you want one? Yeah, give me one.

890
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:12,920
你想要一个吗?索菲娅:不。
You want one? Sophie: No.

891
00:44:12,953 --> 00:44:14,321
乔丹:嘿，你拿着这个。
Jordan: Hey, you take this.

为什么?乔丹:我去找格雷格。
Why? Jordan: I'm gonna find Greg.

893
00:44:16,891 --> 00:44:19,260
格雷格,为什么?马克斯在哪儿?
Greg, why? Where's Max?

894
00:44:19,293 --> 00:44:21,996
也许是麦克斯干的。也许他在这儿。
Maybe Max did it. Maybe he is here.

895
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:23,297
麦克斯非常生大卫的气。
Max was really angry at David.

896
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:24,374
我是认真的，他看起来要
I'm serious, he looked like he was gonna

897
00:44:24,398 --> 00:44:25,299
做些真正操蛋的事。
do something really fucked up.

898
00:44:25,332 --> 00:44:26,967
乔丹:爱丽丝!闭嘴。我只是说。
Jordan: Alice! Shut up. I'm just saying.

899
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:28,269
马克斯不会。
Max would never.

00:44:28,302 --> 00:44:29,970
我们去找格雷格吧。
Let's go find Greg.

他妈的什么?爱丽丝:哦，天哪。
What the fuck? Alice: Oh, my god.

904
00:45:01,101 --> 00:45:03,037
他脸上是什么鬼东西?
Sophie: What the hell is on his face?

905
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,873
这是他的光疗面具。他患有季节性抑郁症。
It's his light therapy mask. He has seasonal depression.

906
00:45:08,008 --> 00:45:09,109
乔丹:我们走吧。
Jordan: Let's go.

907
00:45:22,423 --> 00:45:23,791

艾丽斯:格雷格。
Alice: Greg.

909
00:45:46,013 --> 00:45:48,148
有什么事吗?乔丹:你去哪儿了?
What's up? Jordan: Where have you been?

910
00:45:48,182 --> 00:45:49,350
嗯?
Huh?

911
00:45:49,383 --> 00:45:50,451
你去哪儿了?
Where have you been?

912
00:45:51,285 --> 00:45:53,287
哦,我,嗯…
Oh, I, uh...

913
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,455
我睡不着,
I couldn't sleep,

914
00:45:54,488 --> 00:45:57,024
所以我就下来锻炼了。
so I came down here to do my exercises.

915
00:45:57,057 --> 00:45:58,297
爱丽丝:你为什么不回答我?
Alice: Why didn't you answer me?

916
00:45:58,325 --> 00:45:59,493
你是找我吗?
Were you calling for me?

917
00:45:59,527 --> 00:46:00,894
艾丽斯:是的。
Alice: Yeah.

918
00:46:00,928 --> 00:46:02,930
我…我戴着耳机。
I... I had my headphones in.

919
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:09,870
你们还在玩狼人游戏吗?
Are you guys still playing werewolf?

920
00:46:14,408 --> 00:46:15,943
艾丽斯:格雷格!
Alice: Greg!

921
00:46:15,976 --> 00:46:17,378
停!停止它!
Stop! Stop it!

922
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:23,585
好吧。
All right.

923
00:46:23,618 --> 00:46:25,419
我该怎么办，嗯?
What am I supposed to do, huh?

924
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:26,987
你怎么不告诉我们，该死的格雷格?
Why don't you tell us, fucking Greg?

925
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:29,256
格雷格:那是我的应急包吗?那是一把刀吗?
Greg: Is that my go bag? Is that a knife?

926
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,592
你为什么要带个应急包?
Why did you bring a go bag?

927
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:32,960
飓风吗?看吧，我告诉过你。
The hurricane? See, I told you.

928
00:46:32,993 --> 00:46:34,170
你为什么绕着房子转
Sophie: Why did you circle the fucking house

929
00:46:34,194 --> 00:46:35,262
在你该死的地图上?
on your fucking map?

930
00:46:37,031 --> 00:46:38,566
这是怎么呢大卫已经死了。
What's going on? David is dead.

931
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,134
他的身体在外面。
His body is outside.

932
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:41,468
大卫的身体。等等,什么?
David's body. Wait, what?

933
00:46:41,503 --> 00:46:42,970
你为什么要杀大卫?
Why did you kill David?

934
00:46:43,003 --> 00:46:44,606
你杀了我男朋友。
You murdered my boyfriend.

935
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:48,442
不,不。大卫杀了我。对吧?
No, no. David killed me. Right?

936
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:50,277
乔丹:这不是开玩笑，格雷格。
Jordan: This isn't a joke, Greg.

937
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:52,614
大卫已经死了。有人割了他的喉咙。
David is dead. Somebody slit his throat.

938
00:46:52,647 --> 00:46:54,448
什么?用一把该死的剑，

939
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:56,116

940
00:46:59,621 --> 00:47:01,488
哦……

942
00:47:08,095 --> 00:47:10,364
你们在耍我。
Oh, you guys are fucking with me.

每个人都需要深呼吸。
Everyone needs to take a deep breath.

948
00:47:22,376 --> 00:47:23,410
爱丽丝。
Alice.

949

苏菲:把刀还给我!
Sophie: Give me my knife back!

951
00:47:26,413 --> 00:47:28,550
我不知道!
I don't know!

00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:30,451
放下武器。乔丹:你把它放下。

960
00:47:43,297 --> 00:47:44,365
我们会把它们放下的。
We'll put them down.

961
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:47,669

That seems fair. Alice: Yeah.

964
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:53,173

苏菲!不。不不不，苏菲!

哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my god.

00:49:11,285 --> 00:49:13,287
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my god.

978
00:49:37,177 --> 00:49:38,445
爱丽丝:这不对。
Alice: This isn't right.

979
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:42,149
不是他干的。
He didn't do it.

980
00:49:42,182 --> 00:49:45,118
爱丽丝，你怎么知道的?你怎么知道是他干的?
Alice, how do you know? How do you that know he did?

981
00:49:46,253 --> 00:49:47,488
听着，我的意思是…
Look, I mean, like...

982
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:50,324
如果你看着我们所有人，
If you look at all of us, like,

983
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:53,060
在纸面上,从逻辑上讲,
on paper, logically,

984
00:49:53,093 --> 00:49:55,563
他最有可能实施暴力行为。
he is the most likely to commit an act of violence.

985
00:49:55,597 --> 00:49:57,130
在纸上?
On paper?

986
00:49:58,432 --> 00:50:01,268
你他妈到底在说什么?
What the fuck are you even talking about?

987
00:50:01,301 --> 00:50:02,135
我是说，他是唯一的一个
I mean, he's the only one

988
00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:04,137
谁在军队服役，对吧?所以…
who served in the military, right? So...

989
00:50:05,272 --> 00:50:06,340
什么?
What?

990
00:50:07,775 --> 00:50:09,677
乔丹:他是兽医。
Jordan: He's a vet.

991
00:50:09,711 --> 00:50:11,411
对吧?像伊拉克?还是……
Right? Like Iraq? Or...

992
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:13,146
埃玛:不，我以为是阿富汗。
Emma: No, I thought it was Afghanistan.

993
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,717
他是个兽医。
He was a veterinarian.

994
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,519
他是兽医的助手。
He was a veterinarian's assistant.

995
00:50:17,552 --> 00:50:19,621
你他妈说真的吗?
Are you fucking serious right now?

996
00:50:19,654 --> 00:50:21,823
埃玛:那你为什么叫他大兵乔?
Emma: Then why did you call him g.I. Joe?

997
00:50:21,856 --> 00:50:24,692
因为…你见过他吗?
Because... have you seen him?

998
00:50:24,726 --> 00:50:26,694
不管怎样，不管怎样，
Well, regardless, either way,

999
00:50:26,728 --> 00:50:30,665
在我们所有人当中，他是最大的未知数。
like, out of all of us, he is the biggest unknown.

1000
00:50:30,698 --> 00:50:32,199
我们认识很久了。
We've known each other forever.

1001
00:50:32,232 --> 00:50:34,636
爱丽丝:乔丹，你想做什么?
Alice: Jordan, what are you trying to do?

1002
00:50:34,669 --> 00:50:36,547
乔丹:我不是……我没想做什么。
Jordan: I'm not... I'm not trying to do anything.

1003
00:50:36,571 --> 00:50:38,773
爱丽丝:他死了，好吗?
Alice: He's dead, okay?

1004
00:50:38,806 --> 00:50:40,675
他死了。我们杀了他。
He's dead. We killed him.

1005
00:50:40,708 --> 00:50:42,175
她杀了他。
She killed him.

1006
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,321
去换件衬衫。
Go change your shirt.

1007
00:50:59,527 --> 00:51:02,697
埃玛:我们得走了。我们得离开这里。
Emma: We need to leave. We need to get out of here.

1008
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,097
我们没有车。
We don't have a car.

1009
00:51:04,131 --> 00:51:05,833
好吧，我走着去。艾玛,停下来。
Okay, I'm going to walk. Emma, stop.

1010
00:51:05,867 --> 00:51:06,977
你是什么意思?你不能就这么…
What do you mean? You can't just fucking...

1011
00:51:07,001 --> 00:51:09,303
乔丹:艾玛，你真是荒无人烟。
Jordan: Emma, you're literally in the middle of nowhere.

1012
00:51:09,336 --> 00:51:10,738
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

1013
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:25,118
爱丽丝:我是说，我们任何人都有可能。
Alice: I mean, it could have been any of us.

1014
00:51:25,152 --> 00:51:27,387
灯灭的时候我们都散了。
We all scattered when the lights went out.

1015
00:51:27,421 --> 00:51:30,390
我是说，也可能是麦克斯，好吗?
I mean, it could have been Max, okay?

1016
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:32,459
爱丽丝，你不知道你在说什么。
Alice, you don't know what you are talking about.

1017
00:51:32,492 --> 00:51:35,128
因为你，他打了大卫一拳。
He punched David in the face because of you.

1018
00:51:35,162 --> 00:51:36,864
就因为麦克斯爱上我了
Just because Max is in love with me

1019
00:51:36,898 --> 00:51:38,533
并不意味着他会杀了大卫
doesn't mean he would kill David.

1020
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:41,435
你他妈有什么毛病啊?
Oh, what the fuck is wrong with you?

1021
00:51:41,936 --> 00:51:43,170
艾玛:什么?
Emma: What?

1022
00:51:43,203 --> 00:51:46,306
这不是你和麦克斯的事。
This is not about you and Max.

1023
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,809
你为什么这么刻薄?
Why are you being so mean?

1024
00:51:47,842 --> 00:51:49,677
因为我很难过，艾玛。
Because I'm upset, Emma.

1025
00:51:49,711 --> 00:51:51,813
我难过是因为有人杀了我最好的朋友。
I'm upset because somebody killed my best friend.

1026
00:51:51,846 --> 00:51:54,348
苏菲，你用了吗?我相信你在做
Sophie, did you use? I can believe you're making

1027
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:56,350
这对你。
this about you.

1028
00:51:56,383 --> 00:51:59,854
我也很难过，好吗?我也怕。
I'm sad, too, okay? I'm scared, too.

1029
00:51:59,887 --> 00:52:02,189
我非常爱他。
I loved him so much.

1030
00:52:02,222 --> 00:52:03,691
看起来不像。
It didn't seem like it.

1031
00:52:03,725 --> 00:52:05,492
什么?苏菲:看起来是这样
What? Sophie: It seemed like

1032
00:52:05,526 --> 00:52:06,761
你喜欢有个男朋友。
you loved having a boyfriend.

1033
00:52:06,794 --> 00:52:08,261
你喜欢舒适的感觉。
And you loved feeling comfortable.

1034
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:10,464
但是，不，你不爱他。
But, no, you did not love him.

1035
00:52:10,497 --> 00:52:12,165
你根本就不喜欢他。
You didn't even fucking like him.

1036
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:13,744
你只是太害怕了，不敢做任何事。
You were just too scared to do anything about it.

1037
00:52:13,768 --> 00:52:15,946
所以你多待了三年
So you stayed for three years longer than you should have

1038
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:17,371
因为你是个懦夫。
because you're a coward.

1039
00:52:17,805 --> 00:52:19,239
不,我不是。
No, I'm not.

1040
00:52:19,907 --> 00:52:21,609
不,我不是。
No, I'm not.

1041
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:23,845
我不是。
I'm not.

1042
00:52:24,512 --> 00:52:25,913
我不是。对吧?我…
I'm not. Right? I...

1043
00:52:26,914 --> 00:52:28,683
你……你这么有毒。
You're... you're so toxic.

1044
00:52:28,716 --> 00:52:29,884
艾玛,冷静下来。你。
Emma, calm down. You are.

1045
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:31,318
不!不，我不会…
No! No, I'm not gonna...

1046
00:52:31,351 --> 00:52:32,887
你太毒了。
You are so toxic.

1047
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,657
说实话，当你从地球上消失的时候，
And, honestly, when you fell off the face of the earth,

1048
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,692
大卫是松了一口气。
David was relieved.

1049
00:52:37,725 --> 00:52:41,428
不用再和你打交道了，他松了一口气。
He was relieved he didn't have to deal with you anymore.

1050
00:52:41,461 --> 00:52:43,239
我真希望他们把你的头砍下来，
I wish they had chopped off your head instead,

1051
00:52:43,263 --> 00:52:44,464
你这个没骨气的混蛋。
you spineless piece of shit.

1052
00:52:44,899 --> 00:52:46,333
索菲娅。
Sophie.

1053
00:52:46,366 --> 00:52:47,602
我的天啊。
Alice: Jesus fucking Christ.

1054
00:52:49,537 --> 00:52:50,738
艾玛。
Emma.

1055
00:52:50,772 --> 00:52:52,640
艾玛,来吧。等待。
Emma, come on. Wait.

1056
00:52:52,674 --> 00:52:54,474
等待。艾丽斯:艾玛。
Wait. Alice: Emma.

1057
00:52:54,509 --> 00:52:55,610
艾玛。
Emma.

1058
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,310
艾玛。
Emma.

1059
00:52:58,278 --> 00:52:59,747
乔丹:你说得真好，苏苏。
Jordan: That was real nice, soph.

1060
00:53:00,948 --> 00:53:02,382
家伙……
Guys...

1061
00:53:03,718 --> 00:53:04,852
蜜蜂他妈的在哪里?
Where the fuck is bee?

1062
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:34,709
索菲娅:艾玛。
Sophie: Emma.

1063
00:54:36,077 --> 00:54:37,377
我很抱歉。
I'm so sorry.

1064
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:38,780
我很抱歉。
I'm so sorry.

1065
00:54:38,813 --> 00:54:40,047
我真的很抱歉。
I'm really sorry.

1066
00:54:40,081 --> 00:54:42,349
我现在真是一团糟。
I'm so fucked up right now.

1067
00:54:43,584 --> 00:54:44,652
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

1068
00:54:45,418 --> 00:54:46,888
我很抱歉。我很抱歉。
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1069
00:54:46,921 --> 00:54:48,841
好吧?就好像，事情开始发生了……
Okay? It was just, like, things started coming...

1070
00:54:54,461 --> 00:54:56,697
这不正是你想要的吗?
Isn't that what you wanted?

1071
00:54:58,465 --> 00:54:59,710
是的，艾玛，这就是我想要的。
Yeah, Emma, that's what I wanted.

1072
00:54:59,734 --> 00:55:00,811
这正是我想要的。
That's what I was in the mood for.

1073
00:55:00,835 --> 00:55:02,804
非常感谢。他妈的什么?
Thank you very much. What the fuck?

1074
00:55:02,837 --> 00:55:04,471
耶稣基督!
Jesus Christ!

1075
00:55:04,505 --> 00:55:05,849
你总以为每个人都爱你。
You always think everyone is in love with you.

1076
00:55:05,873 --> 00:55:07,041
它是如此疯狂。我…
It's so crazy. I...

你要这个吗?
Do you want this?

1080
00:55:13,948 --> 00:55:14,982
是的。
Yeah.

1081
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:16,349
谢谢你！

艾丽斯:蜜蜂?
Alice: Bee?

1084
00:55:41,408 --> 00:55:42,442
大学二年级生吗?
Soph?

1085

乔丹:哦，天哪。艾丽斯:艾玛。

1094
00:57:31,919 --> 00:57:34,121
哦,我的上帝。哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

1095
00:57:34,155 --> 00:57:35,823
发生了什么事?我不知道!
What happened? I don't know!

1096
00:57:35,856 --> 00:57:37,058
我不知道。
I don't know.

1097
00:57:39,694 --> 00:57:41,729
别碰她!我只是想…
Don't touch her! I'm just trying to...

1098
00:57:41,762 --> 00:57:43,173
不喜欢。不!弄清楚发生了什么。
Don't. No! Figure out what happened.

1099
00:57:43,197 --> 00:57:44,808
乔丹:我不碰她怎么知道?
Jordan: How am I supposed to know if I don't touch her?

1100
00:57:44,832 --> 00:57:46,499
不要，不要，不要。
Alice: Don't, just don't, just don't.

1101
00:57:47,001 --> 00:57:48,836
哦,他妈的。
Oh, fuck.

1102
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:49,937
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my god.

1103
00:57:51,772 --> 00:57:53,774
爱丽丝:我听到了什么。
Alice: I heard something.

1104
00:57:53,808 --> 00:57:56,577
嗯,也许她……
Um, maybe she...

1105
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:58,546
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my god.

1106
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:00,548
她摔倒了，也许她绊倒了?艾丽斯:没有。
She fell, maybe she tripped? Alice: No.

1107
00:58:00,581 --> 00:58:02,750
不,不。她……
No, no. She...

1108
00:58:02,783 --> 00:58:04,919
她……她被推了，好吗?
She... she got pushed, okay?

1109
00:58:04,952 --> 00:58:07,521
她推。我告诉过你不是格雷格!
She was pushed. I told you it wasn't Greg!

1110
00:58:07,555 --> 00:58:09,123
乔丹:她死了你高兴吗?
Jordan: Are you happy that she's dead?

1111
00:58:09,156 --> 00:58:11,726
不，但我告诉过你不是格雷格!
No, but I told you it wasn't Greg!

1112
00:58:20,001 --> 00:58:21,836
我做了……我告诉过你了。
I did... I did tell you.

1113
00:58:28,209 --> 00:58:29,910
爱丽丝:你没看到发生了什么吗?
Alice: Don't you see what's happening?

1114
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:33,948
什么?
What?

1115
00:58:33,981 --> 00:58:35,149
凶手是谁?
Who was the killer?

1116
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:36,217
什么?
What?

1117
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:39,120
凶手是谁?
Who was the killer?

1118
00:58:39,754 --> 00:58:40,755
在游戏中?
In the game?

1119
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:43,824
它遵循同样的模式。
It's following the same pattern.

1120
00:58:43,858 --> 00:58:44,859
死亡。
The deaths.

1121
00:58:44,892 --> 00:58:46,627
请……求你了，别说了，求你了!
Please... please, just stop talking, please!

1122
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,796
大卫,格雷格,艾玛。
David, Greg, Emma.

1123
00:58:48,829 --> 00:58:50,331
大卫,格雷格,艾玛。
David, Greg, Emma.

1124
00:58:50,364 --> 00:58:51,799
乔丹:没有。是的!
Jordan: No. Yes!

1125
00:58:51,832 --> 00:58:53,072
他妈的是的,乔丹!乔丹:没有。
Fucking yes, Jordan! Jordan: No.

1126
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,669
不，不是同一个模式。
No, it's not following the same pattern.

1127
00:58:55,703 --> 00:58:58,873
格雷格死了，然后我们处决了大卫。
Greg died and then we executed David.

1128
00:58:58,906 --> 00:59:01,275
但在现实生活中，大卫死了，然后我们…
But in real life, David died and then we...

1129
00:59:01,308 --> 00:59:06,247
好吧，但是格雷格，大卫，艾玛。格雷格,大卫,艾玛。
Okay, but Greg, David, Emma. Greg, David, Emma.

1130
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,958
不然为什么会有人把她留在那里
I mean, why else would somebody leave her there

1131
00:59:07,982 --> 00:59:09,259
除非他们想让我们找到她?
unless they wanted us to find her?

1132
00:59:09,283 --> 00:59:10,818
他们为什么要我们找到她?
Why would they want us to find her?

1133
00:59:10,851 --> 00:59:13,854
因为他们在玩一个变态的游戏。
Because they're playing a sick fucking game.

1134
00:59:14,221 --> 00:59:15,790
好吗?
Okay?

1135
00:59:15,823 --> 00:59:17,758
凶手是谁?我不是凶手。
Who was the killer? I wasn't the killer.

1136
00:59:17,792 --> 00:59:18,759
爱丽丝，你他妈嗑嗨了。
Alice, you're fucking coked out.

1137
00:59:18,793 --> 00:59:21,162
你嗑嗨了，好吗?我们都喝高了。
You're coked out, okay? We're all coked out.

1138
00:59:21,195 --> 00:59:22,763
我不是。
I'm not.

1139
00:59:22,797 --> 00:59:23,998
我不是。
I'm not.

1140
00:59:24,965 --> 00:59:26,100
你化了妆吗?
Are you wearing make up?

1141
00:59:28,803 --> 00:59:30,304
我…我在楼上换我的…
I... I was upstairs, changing my...

1142
00:59:30,337 --> 00:59:31,872
爱丽丝:你看起来很奇怪。
Alice: You look weird.

1143
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,241
这是谁的毛衣?
Whose sweater is this?

1144
00:59:34,275 --> 00:59:35,609
我在楼上找到的。
I found it upstairs.

1145
00:59:36,877 --> 00:59:37,921
你认识她多久了?
How long have you known her?

1146
00:59:37,945 --> 00:59:39,180
停止,爱丽丝。
Stop, Alice.

1147
00:59:41,115 --> 00:59:42,116
你是谁?
Who are you?

1148
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:45,319
什么?你出现在这里，
What? You show up here,

1149
00:59:45,352 --> 00:59:47,354
开始对我男朋友微笑。
start smiling at my boyfriend.

1150
00:59:49,223 --> 00:59:50,724
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

1151
00:59:50,758 --> 00:59:51,826
你的声音在颤抖。
Your voice is trembling.

1152
00:59:51,859 --> 00:59:53,761
不。不。是的。它是。
No. No. Yeah. It is.

1153
00:59:53,794 --> 00:59:54,929
乔丹:我在谷歌上搜索过你。
Jordan: I googled you.

1154
00:59:54,962 --> 00:59:56,630
没人叫你的名字
And there was nobody with your name

1155
00:59:56,664 --> 00:59:59,767
今年毕业于犹他州立大学。
who graduated from Utah state this year.

1156
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,670
根本就没有你的出勤记录。
There's literally no record of your attendance, at all.

1157
01:00:02,703 --> 01:00:03,771
他妈的什么?
What the fuck?

1158
01:00:04,405 --> 01:00:06,173
听着，我可以解释。
Listen, I can explain.

1159
01:00:06,207 --> 01:00:07,675
爱丽丝:哦，天哪。
Alice: Oh, my god.

1160
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:09,210
你发现了大卫的尸体。
You discovered David's body.

1161
01:00:09,243 --> 01:00:10,420
不,我只是……你可能做了手脚
No, I just... You could have tampered

1162
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:11,345
发电机,
with the generator,

1163
01:00:11,378 --> 01:00:12,856
就像你对苏菲的车做了手脚一样
just like you tampered with Sophie's car.

1164
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:13,814
你说你没关灯，对吧?
You said you left the lights on, right?

1165
01:00:13,848 --> 01:00:16,016
你是认真的吗?我们看到你杀人了。
Are you serious? We watched you kill someone.

1166
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:18,119
你真的杀了格雷格!
You literally murdered Greg!

1167
01:00:18,152 --> 01:00:19,386
字面上!
Literally!

1168
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,255
字面上!你他妈的生病!
Literally! You sick fuck!

1169
01:00:21,288 --> 01:00:23,357
不，你疯了吗?不。冷静下来。
No, are you crazy? No. Calm down.

1170
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:25,726
我们谈谈吧。谈论它呢?
Let's just talk about it. Talk about it?

1171
01:00:25,759 --> 01:00:27,161
蜜蜂:是的。不…不。
Bee: Yeah. No... no.

1172
01:00:27,194 --> 01:00:28,863
让我们好好谈谈，好吗?
Bee: Let's just talk about it, okay?

1173
01:00:28,896 --> 01:00:30,030
嗯嗯。我不想。
Mmm-mmm. I don't want to.

1174
01:00:30,064 --> 01:00:31,799
蜜蜂:苏菲…索菲娅。艾丽斯:不!
Bee: Sophie... Sophie. Alice: No!

1175
01:00:31,832 --> 01:00:33,276
蜜蜂:索菲娅。别碰她!
Bee: Sophie. Ali, ce: Do not touch her!

1176
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,035
哇!
Whoa!

1177
01:00:35,069 --> 01:00:36,179
你知道吗?我不…
Alice: You know what? I don't...

1178
01:00:36,203 --> 01:00:37,238
我不想让你进来。
I don't want you in here.

1179
01:00:37,271 --> 01:00:38,339
好吧,冷静下来。
Okay, calm down.

1180
01:00:38,372 --> 01:00:39,406
不,我是认真的。爱丽丝!
No, seriously. Alice!

1181
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,680
爱丽丝!我不想让你进来。
Alice! I don't want you in here.

1182
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:42,676
蜜蜂:我……放松。闭嘴!闭嘴!

1183
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:44,011
我不想让你进来。

滚出这个房间!

1186
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,125
我不想再看到你的脸了。出去。
I don't want to look at your face anymore. Get out.

1187
01:00:48,149 --> 01:00:49,226
蜜蜂:爱丽丝，冷静。艾丽斯:我不…
Bee: Alice, calm down. Alice: I'm not...

1188
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,727
爱丽丝:我没冷静下来。蜜蜂:放开我，爱丽丝。
Alice: I'm not calming down. Bee: Let go of me, Alice.

1189
01:00:50,751 --> 01:00:52,820
不，你杀了我的男朋友。
No, you killed my fucking boyfriend.

1190
01:00:52,853 --> 01:00:54,397
你知道吗?你知道吗?这是自卫。
You know what? You know what? It was self-defense.

1191
01:00:54,421 --> 01:00:55,465
艾丽斯:我……我要她出去。
Alice: I... I want her out.

1192
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:56,991
乔丹，你能帮帮我吗?好吧。
Jordan, can you help me? All right.

1193
01:00:57,024 --> 01:00:58,392
乔丹!耶稣,爱丽丝。
Jordan! Jesus, Alice.

1194
01:00:58,425 --> 01:00:59,827
快把门打开!
Get the fucking door!

1195
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,328

01:01:01,362 --> 01:01:02,830
我不想让她进来!
I do not want her in here!

1197
01:01:02,863 --> 01:01:03,964
蜜蜂:放松!艾丽斯:不!
Bee: Relax! Alice: No!

1198
01:01:03,998 --> 01:01:05,900
蜜蜂:放松!艾丽斯:不!
Bee: Relax! Alice: No!

1199
01:01:05,933 --> 01:01:08,068
苏菲!苏菲,做点什么!
Sophie! Sophie, do something!

1200
01:01:08,102 --> 01:01:09,770
你杀了他，滚出去!
You killed him, get out!

1201
01:01:09,803 --> 01:01:11,172
苏菲!艾丽斯:出去!
Sophie! Alice: Get out!

1202
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:17,311
苏菲!

1203
01:03:39,353 --> 01:03:40,588
乔丹:留在这里。
Jordan: Stay here.

1204
01:05:21,723 --> 01:05:23,090
爱丽丝:我好饿。
Alice: I'm so hungry.

1205
01:05:23,123 --> 01:05:24,167
乔丹:你现在怎么会饿呢?
Jordan: How can you be hungry right now?

1206
01:05:24,191 --> 01:05:25,335
爱丽丝:我没想到会这样。
Alice: I wasn't planning on this.

1207
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:27,194
乔丹:爱丽丝……
Jordan: Alice...

1208
01:05:27,227 --> 01:05:29,564
他妈的什么?你他妈怎么进来的?
What the fuck? How the fuck you get in here?

1209
01:05:29,597 --> 01:05:31,198
她有枪。
She has a gun.

1210
01:05:31,231 --> 01:05:33,967
乔丹口袋里有把枪，苏菲，
Jordan has a gun in her pocket, Sophie,

1211
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:35,202
离她远点。
get away from her.

1212
01:05:35,235 --> 01:05:36,413
不，不，苏菲，她让人迷惑…
No, no, Sophie, she's confusing...

1213
01:05:36,437 --> 01:05:37,505
放开我。
Let go of me.

1214
01:05:37,539 --> 01:05:39,173
你在开玩笑吗?
Are you kidding me?

1215
01:05:39,206 --> 01:05:40,508
我没有枪。
I don't have a gun.

1216
01:05:40,542 --> 01:05:42,409
蜜蜂:那就把口袋里的东西都掏出来。
Bee: Then empty your pockets.

1217
01:05:44,546 --> 01:05:45,547
慢慢的!
Slowly!

1218
01:05:55,523 --> 01:05:56,990
就这些吗?
That's it?

1219
01:05:57,024 --> 01:05:58,225
就是这样。
That's it.

1220
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,962
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my god.

1221
01:06:03,263 --> 01:06:04,364
你是凶手。
You are the killer.

1222
01:06:06,634 --> 01:06:08,469
在…在游戏中…我…
In the... in the game... I...

1223
01:06:08,503 --> 01:06:10,037
你他妈怎么进来的?
How the fuck did you get in here?

1224
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:11,682
枪在哪里?我他妈没有枪。
Where is the gun? I don't have a fucking gun.

1225
01:06:11,706 --> 01:06:14,642
我们把所有的门都锁了。你是怎么进来的?
We locked all the doors. How did you get in?

1226
01:06:14,676 --> 01:06:15,710
你杀了他。
You killed him.

1227
01:06:15,743 --> 01:06:18,278
我为什么要杀大卫?我为什么要杀大卫?
Why would I kill David? Why would I kill David?

1228
01:06:18,312 --> 01:06:19,179
我为什么要杀艾玛?
Why would I kill Emma?

1229
01:06:19,213 --> 01:06:20,113
他们真的是我最老的朋友。
They are, literally, my oldest friends.

1230
01:06:20,147 --> 01:06:22,282
你他妈才刚认识他们!你怎么敢?
You just fucking met them! How dare you?

1231
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:23,417
当我找到大卫时，
When I found David,

1232
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:26,019
你是最后一个到那里的人。
you were the last person to get there.

1233
01:06:27,087 --> 01:06:29,022
你花了一些时间。这是真的。
It took you awhile. That's true.

1234
01:06:29,056 --> 01:06:31,458
艾玛死的时候你在哪里?
Bee: Where were you when Emma died, hmm?

1235
01:06:31,492 --> 01:06:33,093
你推她!闭嘴!
You pushed her! Shut up!

1236
01:06:33,126 --> 01:06:34,471
别听她的。你根本不知道这是怎么回事
Guy's, don't listen to her. You don't know what the fuck

1237
01:06:34,495 --> 01:06:36,196
你在说什么!然后，我看到了你。
you're talking about! And then, I saw you.

1238
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,565
我看到你拿枪了。
I saw you getting the gun.

1239
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:38,666
乔丹:那是谎言。
Jordan: That's a lie.

1240
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,034
这他妈是个谎言。你就是在说谎。你是一个骗子!
That's a fucking lie. You're lying. You're a liar!

1241
01:06:41,068 --> 01:06:42,737
你他妈是在说谎。
You're lying through your fucking teeth.

1242
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:43,605
你说的都是谎话。
You lied about everything.

1243
01:06:43,638 --> 01:06:45,172
你对苏菲撒了谎
You lied about everything to Sophie.

1244
01:06:45,205 --> 01:06:46,774
你他妈是个骗子。
You're a fucking liar.

1245
01:06:46,808 --> 01:06:49,076
是的,你……你确实对苏菲撒谎了。
Yeah, you... You did lie to Sophie.

1246
01:06:53,681 --> 01:06:54,749
好的。
Okay.

1247
01:06:57,084 --> 01:06:58,118
好的。
Okay.

1248
01:07:02,322 --> 01:07:04,224
我确实上过犹他州立大学
I did go to Utah state

1249
01:07:04,692 --> 01:07:06,661
为一个学期。
for one semester.

1250
01:07:06,694 --> 01:07:10,732
但我妈妈…她的日子不好过
But my mom was... She was having a hard time

1251
01:07:10,765 --> 01:07:12,499
我就回家照顾她了
and I came home to take care of her.

1252
01:07:15,302 --> 01:07:16,738
我确实在gamehut工作过，
And I did work at gamehut,

1253
01:07:18,405 --> 01:07:20,440
但他们关闭了我们的店，
but they shut down our location, like,

1254
01:07:20,474 --> 01:07:22,744
我认识你一周后我…我一直在申请，但是…
a week after I met you. I... I've been applying, but...

1255
01:07:22,777 --> 01:07:24,111
我摔倒的时候你在干什么
What were you doing when I dropped

1256
01:07:24,144 --> 01:07:25,279
你去商场了吗?
you off at the mall?

1257
01:07:29,817 --> 01:07:32,386
在美食广场闲逛。我…
Hung out at the food court. I...

1258
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:37,457
不想让你失望。
Didn't want to disappoint you.

1259
01:07:42,396 --> 01:07:43,565
我很尴尬。
I was embarrassed.

1260
01:07:48,201 --> 01:07:49,771
我应该告诉你的。我只是…
I should have told you. I just...

1261
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:53,575
我的妈妈,她……
My mom, she...

1262
01:07:55,643 --> 01:07:56,811
她有……
She has...

1263
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:01,148
我妈妈有边缘性人格障碍。
My mom has borderline.

1264
01:08:01,816 --> 01:08:03,383
爱丽丝:哦，天哪。
Alice: Oh, my god.

1265
01:08:04,484 --> 01:08:06,554
我很抱歉，那…
I'm so sorry, that's...

1266
01:08:06,588 --> 01:08:07,855
这是非常严重的。
That's really serious.

1267
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:10,758
心理健康是一个非常严重的问题。
Mental health is a really serious issue.

1268
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:13,628
我从来没对任何人说过，但是…
I mean, I've never actually said this to anyone, but...

1269
01:08:16,496 --> 01:08:17,575
但我有身体畸形。
But I have body dysmorphia.

1270
01:08:17,599 --> 01:08:19,601
哦,我的上帝。闭嘴，爱丽丝。
Oh, my god. Shut the fuck up, Alice.

1271
01:08:21,936 --> 01:08:23,805
我想告诉你的。我只是…
I wanted to tell you. I just...

1272
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:29,777
我只是想让你喜欢我。
I just really wanted you to like me.

1273
01:08:39,654 --> 01:08:42,389
你他妈开什么玩笑。
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

1274
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:46,694
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my god.

1275
01:08:46,728 --> 01:08:47,629
乔丹，搞什么鬼?
Jordan, what the fuck?

1276
01:08:47,662 --> 01:08:48,939
你是说你相信吗
Are you telling me that you believe that

1277
01:08:48,963 --> 01:08:49,831
堆废话吗?
pile of bullshit?

1278
01:08:49,864 --> 01:08:51,566
这是为了激发信心吗?
Is that supposed to inspire confidence?

1279
01:08:51,599 --> 01:08:53,300
她妈妈有“边缘性人格障碍”。
Her mom has "borderline."

1280
01:08:53,333 --> 01:08:55,803
这对其他人来说不是危险信号吗?
Is that not a red fucking flag to anybody else?

1281
01:08:55,837 --> 01:08:56,938
这是一个很严重的问题。
That's a serious issue.

1282
01:08:56,971 --> 01:08:58,405
你他妈从哪弄来的?
Where the fuck did you get that?

1283
01:08:58,438 --> 01:08:59,473
大卫的爸爸丰富的!
David's dad's rich!

1284
01:08:59,507 --> 01:09:00,440
有钱人都他妈有枪，苏菲!
Rich people have fucking guns, Sophie!

1285
01:09:00,474 --> 01:09:02,242
我的父母很富有。他们没有枪。
My parents are rich. They don't have guns.

1286
01:09:02,275 --> 01:09:03,745
我是说，我们都很有钱
Well, I mean, we're all rich,

1287
01:09:03,778 --> 01:09:05,913
但你和大卫很有钱很有钱
but you and David are like rich, rich.

1288
01:09:05,947 --> 01:09:07,882
这对我来说从来都不重要……
That has never mattered to me...

1289
01:09:07,915 --> 01:09:09,617
你他妈给我闭嘴!
Oh, shut the fuck up!

1290
01:09:09,651 --> 01:09:11,519
我们甚至都不想邀请你。
We didn't even want to invite you.

1291
01:09:11,552 --> 01:09:12,854
我们讨论过邀请你
We debated about inviting you,

1292
01:09:12,887 --> 01:09:14,589
而是因为这是大卫的房子。
but because it's David's house.

1293
01:09:14,622 --> 01:09:15,890
我没那么说，但是…
I didn't say that, but...

1294
01:09:15,923 --> 01:09:17,825
不，你没有在群聊中回复我。
And, no, you did not respond in the group chat.

1295
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:20,494
然后，你就带着这个变态出现了。
And then, you show up with this fucking psychopath.

1296
01:09:20,528 --> 01:09:22,664
别叫她精神变态，那太歧视残疾人了。
Don't call her a psychopath, that's so ableist.

1297
01:09:22,697 --> 01:09:24,297
去你妈的。你们配得上对方。
Fuck you. You deserve each other.

1298
01:09:24,331 --> 01:09:26,299
我希望她在你睡觉的时候让你窒息。
I hope she fucking suffocates you in your sleep.

1299
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:29,302
爱丽丝:是啊，你在聊天中没有回复。
Alice: Yeah, you didn't reply in the chat.

1300
01:09:29,336 --> 01:09:31,939
大卫告诉过我
And David actually told me

1301
01:09:31,973 --> 01:09:35,643
你求他跟你父母谈谈
that you, like, begged him to talk to your parents

1302
01:09:35,677 --> 01:09:38,445
就像，再次解锁你的信任。
and, like, unlock your trust again.

1303
01:09:38,478 --> 01:09:39,857
这就是你来这里的原因。
And that's why you're actually here.

1304
01:09:39,881 --> 01:09:41,214
噢,是吗?
Oh, yeah?

1305
01:09:41,248 --> 01:09:42,325
是啊，他告诉你了吗
Oh, yeah, did he tell you that

1306
01:09:42,349 --> 01:09:43,727
当你们排在我前面的时候。
while you guys were railing lines in front of me.

1307
01:09:43,751 --> 01:09:44,585
你吸毒的朋友
Your addict friend

1308
01:09:44,619 --> 01:09:46,721
你到底在担心谁?
who you're supposedly so worried about?

1309
01:09:46,754 --> 01:09:48,255
我们都很担心。索菲娅:不!
We are worried. Sophie: No!

1310
01:09:48,288 --> 01:09:49,667
不,不,不。让我把话说清楚。
No, no, no. Let me get this straight.

1311
01:09:49,691 --> 01:09:50,801
好吧，让我搞清楚。
Okay, let me get this straight.

1312
01:09:50,825 --> 01:09:52,259
所以，当黑人女孩
So, when the black girl

1313
01:09:52,292 --> 01:09:53,828
有吸食可卡因的习惯，这是个问题。
has a coke habit, it's a problem.

1314
01:09:53,861 --> 01:09:55,530
但当她周围的人都这么做时，
But when everyone else around her does it,

1315
01:09:55,563 --> 01:09:57,598
包括她最好的朋友，恰好是白人
including her best friend, who happens to be white

1316
01:09:58,032 --> 01:09:59,299
,男,
and male,

1317
01:09:59,332 --> 01:10:00,568
它很好吗?
it's fine?

1318
01:10:00,601 --> 01:10:03,638
我理解，我是你的盟友
I understand and I'm an ally,

1319
01:10:03,671 --> 01:10:07,642
我完全明白…
and I totally get how it...

1320
01:10:09,443 --> 01:10:10,578
看上去如此。
Looks that way.

1321
01:10:11,646 --> 01:10:12,714
和…
And...

1322
01:10:13,781 --> 01:10:14,882
嗯…
Um...

1323
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:17,685
约旦吗?哦,我的上帝。
Jordan? Oh, my god.

1324
01:10:17,719 --> 01:10:20,253
你沉迷于扮演受害者。
You are obsessed with playing the victim.

1325
01:10:20,287 --> 01:10:21,189
苏菲:对不起?
Sophie: Excuse me?

1326
01:10:21,221 --> 01:10:22,857
我不得不和你一起上了救护车
I had to ride in the ambulance with you

1327
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:24,892
三次，以为你死了。
three times, thinking you were dead.

1328
01:10:24,926 --> 01:10:26,761
我需要帮助，我得到了帮助
I needed help and I got it

1329
01:10:26,794 --> 01:10:27,929
我很抱歉。你有帮助吗?
and I'm sorry. You got help?

1330
01:10:27,962 --> 01:10:31,398
你是说我们得向你爸告发你
You mean we had to narc on you to your fucking dad

1331
01:10:31,431 --> 01:10:33,801
所以他会切断你的经济来源，送你去戒毒所，
so he'd cut you off and ship you off to rehab,

1332
01:10:33,835 --> 01:10:37,270
而你却在不停地又踢又叫。
while you were quite literally kicking and screaming.

1333
01:10:37,304 --> 01:10:38,539
是的。然后你就
Yeah. And then you just

1334
01:10:38,573 --> 01:10:40,007
从地球上消失了。
fell off the face of the earth.

1335
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:41,151
因为这就是你的工作，苏苏。
'Cause that's what you do, soph.

1336
01:10:41,175 --> 01:10:42,920
遇到困难的时候，你就该逃跑。
That's what you do when things get tough, you run.

1337
01:10:42,944 --> 01:10:45,345
你他妈跑去写回忆录了。
You ran away to go write your fucking memoirs.

1338
01:10:45,378 --> 01:10:47,380
这是一种创造性的非虚构作品，这是一种有效的回应
It's creative non-fiction which is a valid response

1339
01:10:47,414 --> 01:10:48,883
关注经济中的生活。
to life in an attention economy.

1340
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:50,551
哦，去死吧。
Oh, fuck off and die.

1341
01:10:50,585 --> 01:10:51,686
你写小论文
You write little essays

1342
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:53,988
关于你妈妈和她的伏特加。
about your mommy and her vodka.

1343
01:10:54,021 --> 01:10:55,489
还有你的阴部和你的感情。
And your pussy and your feelings.

1344
01:10:55,523 --> 01:10:56,758
还有你的感情。
And your fucking feelings.

1345
01:10:56,791 --> 01:10:58,559
天啊，我们都要淹死了
Oh, my god, we are all drowning

1346
01:10:58,593 --> 01:10:59,961
在你他妈的感觉里。
in your fucking feelings.

1347
01:10:59,994 --> 01:11:02,997
感觉是事实。不!不,他们不是。
Feelings are facts. No! No, they're not.

1348
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:04,297
事实就是事实。
Facts are facts.

1349
01:11:04,331 --> 01:11:05,700
苏菲，你为什么不告诉我们?
Why did you ghost us, Sophie?

1350
01:11:05,733 --> 01:11:06,868
喜欢为什么?
Like why?

1351
01:11:07,869 --> 01:11:09,336
因为你刺激了我。
Because you fucking trigger me.

1352
01:11:11,404 --> 01:11:12,540
你支持我。
You enable me.

1353
01:11:13,975 --> 01:11:15,009
她知道吗?
Does she know?

1354
01:11:15,042 --> 01:11:16,443
她知道什么吗?
Sophie: Does she know what?

1355
01:11:17,078 --> 01:11:19,479
你恳求我
That you begged me

1356
01:11:19,514 --> 01:11:21,949
我来的路上顺便去趟你的公寓。
to stop at your apartment on my way up here.

1357
01:11:21,983 --> 01:11:23,316
我所做的。
And I did.

1358
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:25,586
我们在你车里做爱。
And we fucked in your car.

1359
01:11:26,721 --> 01:11:27,588
她他妈的说谎。
She's fucking lying.

1360
01:11:27,622 --> 01:11:28,899
她在睁眼说瞎话。
She's lying through her fucking teeth.

1361
01:11:28,923 --> 01:11:29,967
她想扰乱你的大脑。
She's trying to get in your head.

1362
01:11:29,991 --> 01:11:31,692
别听她的，好吗?
Don't listen to her, okay?

1363
01:11:31,726 --> 01:11:32,827
检查她的短信。
Check her texts.

1364
01:11:35,495 --> 01:11:37,532
你疯了，乔丹。
You are unhinged, Jordan.

1365
01:11:38,866 --> 01:11:41,669
你缺乏同理心。
You are devoid of empathy.

1366
01:11:41,702 --> 01:11:43,004
你没有感情。
You have no feelings.

1367
01:11:43,037 --> 01:11:44,806
你想知道我为什么不能吗
Do you want to know why I could never

1368
01:11:44,839 --> 01:11:46,306
和你在一起过吗?
ever be with you?

1369
01:11:47,374 --> 01:11:48,475
因为你的时间表
Because you schedule

1370
01:11:48,509 --> 01:11:50,511
你日历上的所有事
everything in your fucking Google calendar,

1371
01:11:50,545 --> 01:11:51,746
包括性。
including sex.

1372
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:53,881
因为你没有灵魂。
Because you have no soul.

1373
01:11:53,915 --> 01:11:54,982
乔丹:去你妈的。
Jordan: Fuck you.

1374
01:11:55,016 --> 01:11:56,884
你感情上受虐待。
You're emotionally abusive.

1375
01:11:56,918 --> 01:11:58,418
我得去接受创伤后应激障碍的治疗。
I had to go to therapy for PTSD.

1376
01:11:58,451 --> 01:12:00,353
你可以问爱丽丝。
You can fucking ask Alice.

1377
01:12:00,387 --> 01:12:02,089
是的,她做的。
Yeah, she did.

1378
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:04,091
很长一段时间。
For a long time.

1379
01:12:09,496 --> 01:12:11,364
你讨厌爱丽丝。
You hate Alice.

1380
01:12:11,398 --> 01:12:13,034
不,我不喜欢。是啊，你鄙视她。
No, I don't. Yeah, you despise her.

1381
01:12:13,067 --> 01:12:14,545
你总是抱怨自己有多无聊
You complain constantly about how vapid

1382
01:12:14,569 --> 01:12:15,937
她很烦人。你讨厌她。
and annoying she is. You hate her.

1383
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:17,805
你总是不停地取笑我，真可怜
It's pitiful how you won't stop making fun

1384
01:12:17,839 --> 01:12:19,907
她那愚蠢的播客。
of her stupid little podcast.

1385
01:12:19,941 --> 01:12:21,474
让她用播客吧。
Let her have the podcast.

1386
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:24,377
我不知道你在说什么。
I don't know what you're talking about.

1387
01:12:24,411 --> 01:12:27,648
你讨厌听她的播客。
You hate listen to her podcast.

1388
01:12:27,682 --> 01:12:28,683
等待……
Wait...

1389
01:12:29,083 --> 01:12:30,383
什么?
What?

1390
01:12:31,451 --> 01:12:32,954
你让我们以生命发誓
And you made us swear on our lives

1391
01:12:32,987 --> 01:12:34,088
不要告诉任何人。
not to tell anyone.

1392
01:12:34,856 --> 01:12:36,023
乔丹，这是真的吗?
Jordan, is that true?

1393
01:12:37,424 --> 01:12:39,527
我喜欢你的播客，爱丽丝。
I like your podcast, Alice.

1394
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:42,429
你的播客是关于什么的?
What is your podcast about?

1395
01:12:42,462 --> 01:12:44,464
和你最聪明最有趣的朋友出去玩。
Hanging out with your smartest and funniest friend.

1396
01:12:44,497 --> 01:12:47,969
你刚刚是在呻吟吗?
Did you just groan?

1397
01:12:48,002 --> 01:12:49,036
不。
No.

1398
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:50,004
我说"出去玩"的时候
When I said "hanging out

1399
01:12:50,037 --> 01:12:52,006
"和你最聪明最有趣的朋友"
"with your smartest and funniest friend."

1400
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:54,508
哦,我的上帝。像这样。像这样!
Oh, my god. Like that. Like that!

1401
01:12:54,542 --> 01:12:55,710
他妈的!你又来了。
Fuck! You just did it again.

1402
01:12:55,743 --> 01:12:57,044
不,我没有!首先,
No, I didn't! First of all,

1403
01:12:57,078 --> 01:12:59,747
播客需要花很多功夫，好吗?
a podcast takes a lot of work, okay?

1404
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:01,082
你得组织好客人。
You have to organize the guests.

1405
01:13:01,115 --> 01:13:02,884
你得做个谷歌日历
You have to do a Google calendar

1406
01:13:02,917 --> 01:13:05,119
然后你就有了追随者。
and you build a following.

1407
01:13:05,152 --> 01:13:06,888
这他妈的要花很长时间!
It takes a long fucking time!

1408
01:13:06,921 --> 01:13:08,723
我已经研究了一段时间了!
And I've been working on it for a while!

1409
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:10,758
好吗?
Okay?

1410
01:13:10,791 --> 01:13:12,760
然后，我说，
And then, let me say,

1411
01:13:12,793 --> 01:13:15,763
没人喜欢你，好吗?
that nobody likes you, okay?

1412
01:13:15,796 --> 01:13:19,066
没有人喜欢你!没有人喜欢你!
Nobody likes you! Nobody likes you!

1413
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:20,811
你知道吗，当你喝醉了，向我哭诉，
Do you know when you're drunk and you cry to me,

1414
01:13:20,835 --> 01:13:22,503
“哦，恐怕没人喜欢我
"oh, I'm afraid nobody likes me

1415
01:13:22,536 --> 01:13:24,147
"因为我又贱又贱，我很烂"
"because I'm mean and a bitch and I suck."

1416
01:13:24,171 --> 01:13:27,541
你知道的，好吗?你他妈的很烂。
Well, you do, okay? You fucking suck.

1417
01:13:27,575 --> 01:13:29,710
我和你在一起只是出于同情
And I only hang out with you out of pity

1418
01:13:29,744 --> 01:13:32,580
以及我们共同历史令人窒息的重压。
and the suffocating weight of our shared history.

1419
01:13:32,613 --> 01:13:34,849
就这些。
And that is all.

1420
01:13:34,882 --> 01:13:37,484
你是如此的爱我
And you're just so in love

1421
01:13:37,518 --> 01:13:39,654
从你白手起家的故事来看
with your rags to riches narrative,

1422
01:13:39,687 --> 01:13:41,589
好像你是世界上唯一的人
like you're the only fucking person in the world

1423
01:13:41,622 --> 01:13:43,157
他出身贫寒。
who didn't come from money.

1424
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:45,159
你知道吗?
You know what?

1425
01:13:45,192 --> 01:13:49,196
你的父母是中上阶层。
Your parents are upper middle class.

1426
01:13:50,698 --> 01:13:51,799
不,他们不是。
No, they're not.

1427
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:53,433
乔丹。
Jordan.

1428
01:13:54,168 --> 01:13:56,003
他们是。
They are.

1429
01:13:56,037 --> 01:13:58,105
他们在一所大学教书。
They teach at a university.

1430
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:01,509
这是公开的。
It's public.

1431
01:14:01,542 --> 01:14:03,644
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my god.

1432
01:14:03,678 --> 01:14:06,647
天啊，难怪索菲吸毒过量了。
Oh, my god, I mean, no wonder Sophie od'd.

1433
01:14:06,681 --> 01:14:08,149
谁能确定一个该死的电子表格的日期
Who could date a fucking spreadsheet

1434
01:14:08,182 --> 01:14:09,583
有优越感吗?
with a superiority complex?

1435
01:14:09,617 --> 01:14:11,097
就像，你真是个…
It's, like, you're such a...

1436
01:14:11,919 --> 01:14:13,988
噢!
Ow!

1437
01:14:14,922 --> 01:14:16,657
他妈的什么?
What the fuck?

1438
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:17,992
搞什么，乔丹?
Sophie: What the fuck, Jordan?

1439
01:14:18,025 --> 01:14:21,028
爱丽丝:哦，天哪。你是认真的吗?
Alice: Oh, my god. Are you serious?

1440
01:14:21,062 --> 01:14:22,697
你他妈是开枪打我吗?
Did you just fucking shoot me?

1441
01:14:24,832 --> 01:14:27,168
不。你他妈射中了我。
No. Alice: You fucking shot me.

1442
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:28,936
拿着枪!
With a gun!

1443
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:29,937
乔丹:不，我没有开枪打你。我…
Jordan: No, I didn't shoot you. I...

1444
01:14:29,971 --> 01:14:32,139
你他妈的杀了他们，你这个变态!
Alice: You fucking murdered them, you freak!

1445
01:14:32,173 --> 01:14:34,608
你是凶手。我就知道!
You're the murderer. I knew it!

1446
01:14:34,642 --> 01:14:36,177
我就知道，你就是个贱人!
I knew it, you're such a bitch!

1447
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:37,144
你这个婊子!
You're such a fucking bitch!

1448
01:14:37,178 --> 01:14:39,146
我没有谋杀任何人。爱丽丝:是的，你说了。
I didn't murder anybody. Alice: Yes, you did.

1449
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:40,748
乔丹，把枪放下。
Jordan, put the gun down.

1450
01:14:40,781 --> 01:14:42,783
爱丽丝:我从来没中过枪。
Alice: I've never been shot before.

1451
01:14:42,817 --> 01:14:45,853
真他妈疼!
It really fucking hurts!

1452
01:14:45,886 --> 01:14:47,588
把枪放下，拜托。
Sophie: Put the fucking gun down, please.

1453
01:14:47,621 --> 01:14:49,590
你这样做。是你逼我这么做的。
You did this. You made me do this.

1454
01:14:49,623 --> 01:14:50,858
你为什么逼我这么做?
Why did you make me do that?

1455
01:14:50,891 --> 01:14:51,969
你在做什么?把枪放下。
What are you doing? Put the gun down.

1456
01:14:51,993 --> 01:14:54,128
为什么?你为什么朝我开枪?
Why? Why did you shoot me?

1457
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:55,129
乔丹:我没有开枪打你。
Jordan: I did not shoot you.

1458
01:14:55,162 --> 01:14:57,031
是的,你做的!那把枪!停止,停止,停止。
Yes, you did! With that gun! Stop, stop, stop.

1459
01:14:57,064 --> 01:14:58,699
爱丽丝,停止。停!那把枪。
Alice, stop. Stop! With that gun.

1460
01:14:58,733 --> 01:15:00,668
别到处挥舞了。我不是挥舞着。
Stop waving it around. I'm not waving.

1461
01:15:00,701 --> 01:15:02,036
不要打我。你已经开枪打我了。
Don't hit me. You already shot me.

1462
01:15:02,069 --> 01:15:03,871
停!别碰我。
Stop! Don't touch me.

1463
01:15:03,904 --> 01:15:05,248
苏菲:不，不，不!爱丽丝:拿枪来!
Sophie: No, no, no! Alice: Get the gun!

1464
01:15:05,272 --> 01:15:07,074
索菲娅:不!苏菲，枪!
Sophie: No! Alice: Sophie, the gun!

1465
01:15:07,108 --> 01:15:08,642
不!停!你踩到我腿了!
Don't! Stop! You're on my leg!

1466
01:15:08,676 --> 01:15:09,810
你踩到我腿了!
You're on my leg!

1467
01:15:10,578 --> 01:15:11,946
我想要它。把它给我!
I want it. Give it to me!

1468
01:15:11,979 --> 01:15:14,148
乔丹:不!苏菲:放开!
Jordan: No! Sophie: Let go!

1469
01:15:18,652 --> 01:15:19,754
乔丹:不!

艾丽斯:不!
Alice: No!
