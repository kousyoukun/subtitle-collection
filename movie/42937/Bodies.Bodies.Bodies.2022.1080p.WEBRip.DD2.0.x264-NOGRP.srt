I can't believe
you're here, like,

68
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,100
last time I saw you,

69
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,380
you were coked out
on the subway,

70
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,110
pissing on the floor
like a little hyena.

71
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,770
I thought you
were an nyu student.

72
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,340
Oh, my god.

73
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,050
And that is why we do not let
the henny monster out anymore.

74
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,010
No, no!

75
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,450

00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,120
- I miss you!
- I miss you too.

80
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,790
Also, I have to say,
love the podcast.

81
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,100
Okay, we have a fan of the pod.

82
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,500
We love the podcast.

83
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,760

Ooh, spicy, spicy, Jordan.

101
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,010
What is that supposed to mean?

102
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,980
Just means that
we have all been here

103
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,250
and nobody had any fucking
clue that you were coming.

104
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,820
Let alone, an hour before

105
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,380
the storm is supposed
to start, so...

106
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,250
What? I totally
told you guys

107
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,290
that I was coming.

108
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,320
And I texted you.

109
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,530
In the group chat?
Yeah.

110
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,590
No, you didn't.
Whatever,

111
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,500
you guys know that i'm
useless with text, right?

112
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,640
Also, we meant

113
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,330
but then bee got scheduled

114
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,240
Oh, where do you work?

115
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,910

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,500
It's, uh, zucchini. A bread.

131
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:03,070
- It's zucchini bread.
- Thank you.

132
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,370

How did you do that?

136
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,380
- Did you see that?
- All right.

137
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,660

165
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,040
He's just taking a break.
He'll be back.

166
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,140
What does that mean?

172
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,380
Sure. What's up?

173

00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,160
"Brought you
zucchini bread, Dave."

181
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,530
She's mine. Hands off.

182
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,110
Hey.

183
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,250
Oh, hi... I...

184
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,190
- Uh, I was just...
- No, no, I know.

185
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,620
It's beautiful. The house.

186
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,990
Sophie's parents have one
that's even bigger.

187
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,570
Just be careful, okay?

188
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,240
With Sophie. Just...

189
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,770
Be careful.

190
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,610
Okay.

191
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,180
Okay.

192
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,630
But he's, like, not hot.
You know what I mean?

193
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,760
He's like, like, your mom

194
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,290
would be like,
"ooh, he's hot."

195
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,630
Not your mom,
I mean moms in general.

196
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,530
Moms that have been married

197
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,470
for like 10, 15 years
and they see, like,

198
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,130
him going out of a Starbucks...

199
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,370
Alice got to bring someone
without telling anyone.

200
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,340
So you do read the chat.

201
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,440
Why is everyone
so obsessed with the chat?

202
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,550
Now, you're here. I'm here,
we're here together, right?

203
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,240
Why are we worrying
about the chat?

204
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,710
When we can just
live in the moment.

205
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,790
Yeah, it's 'cause
you went to rehab

206
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:34,850
and you're not on drugs.

207
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,750
So, like, everything is like,

208
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,220
"ooh, why don't
we just all be cool, man?"

209
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,160
You have a little problem
with Greg?

210
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,590
The lumberjack.

211
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,660
It's a new pod.

212
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,230
I'm not used
to the inhaling yet.

213
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,560
What is he, like, 40?

214
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,870
I don't know.
I think Alice found him

215
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,500
on tinder, or some shit.

216
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,630
Apparently, he was
in Afghanistan.

217
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,240
I think he was in the army,
or some shit, so...

218
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,470
Well, that's hot.

219
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,370
He's not...
He's not, like, that hot.

220
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,650
You don't have to think
he's attractive,

221
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,390
only Alice has to think
that he's attractive.

222
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,640
Like, I feel, like,

223
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,680
I'm more attractive than that.

224
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,220
- You do?
- Absolutely.

225
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,480
And what are the features

226
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,660
that you're bringing
to the table?

227
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,120
Well, I just look like I fuck.

228
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,550
- You know what I mean?
- Mmm.

229
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,660
I look like I... I fuck.

230
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,790
And that's the vibe
I like to put out there.

231
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,630
- Yeah.
- No, uh, yeah,

232
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,470
he's, he's really
handsome. Whatever.

233
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,270
I mean, we don't have to
talk about it all the time.

234
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,680
What the fuck
happened to your face?

235
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,570
Fucking Max.

236
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,370
- Max did that?
- Yes, fucking Max, really.

237
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,480
Okay? I was standing outside

238
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,880
and he just ran up to me
and punched me in the eye.

239
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,080
- Just ran up to you?
- He just did.

240
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,790
Look at it. He just came up to you
and did that, huh?

241
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,190
I think it...
Actually think it looks

242
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,910
kind of dope, though.
Don't you think?

243
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,410
It's getting fucking darker.

244
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,720
I look like a,
like a warrior. Right?

245
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,290
Like, it's kind of...
It's kind of cool.

246
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,490
Like, it's kind of hot.

247
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,900
Like, if you saw me
coming out of a 7-Eleven,

248
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,190
you'd be like...

249
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,260
Um...

250
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,660
So have you had a chance to, uh,

251
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,230
talk to my parents at all?

252
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,470
What the fuck
are you doing here, soph?

253
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,700
I missed you.

254
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,610
We both know that's a lie.

255
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,240
Nobody's ever missed me.

256
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,850
Ugh, no! Please, no!

257
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,260
Ugh, my god,
can you turn that off?

258
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,630
It's bumming me out.

259
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,800
Yeah. You're right.
You're right.

260
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,600
Hey, guys, can I...
Can I get on the Wi-Fi?

261
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,270
Oh, god, I can never
remember the password.

262
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,470
It's, like, an actually
good password.

263
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,230
I'll transfer it.
What's your email?

264
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,340
Uh... what?

265
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,950
What is your email?

266
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,750
Hey...

267
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,750
I'm sorry.
My service went out,

268
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,590
but I am on a Wi-Fi now.

269
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,460
So, that's good.

270
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,960
I 100% wanna do a tiktok.
All of you can do it.

271
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,830
- Okay. Do you know this?
- Which one is it?

272
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,470
I don't know
what I'm doing.

273
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,780
Follow...
We'll watch it...

274
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,400
You'll catch it. Yeah.

275
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,470
Okay, ready, three, two...

276
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,510
Keep up, keep up.

277
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,010
- Go!
- Look at you.

278
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
Are we at the last part?

279
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,050
That was good.
That was good. Okay.

280
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,620
Greg went a little rogue
but we're checking the moves.

281
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,750
- No, you didn't.
- Again, again, again.

282
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,060
At the end
you go like this.

283
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,890
Ready? Get ready.
You okay?

284
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,830
We should just,
just post it.

285
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,790
It's very good.

286
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,470
I'm ready for
the flow. One more time!

287
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,600
Three, two, one, go!

288
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,900
Do you want a drink?

289
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,000
Do you want something?

290
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,570
Here you go. There we go!

291
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,440
She's having a good time.

292
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,540
Let's go!

293
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,940
Yeah! Oh, my god.

294
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,410
Okay, bitch.

295
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,040
I make it very salty.

296
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,510
It's incredibly salty.

297
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,580
Is this your
first relationship?

298
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,720
Uh, no.

299
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,720
You just, kind of,
give that vibe.

300
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,860
- Not in a bad way.
- Yeah.

301
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,560
How long have
you guys been together?

302
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,560
Oh, uh, six weeks.

303
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,660
- Nice.
- Wow.

304
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,530
Six weeks with Sophie.

305
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,800
- Alice.
- In a good way, that's good.

306
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,470
Are you from Moscow?

307
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,370
- No.
- Oh.

308
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,500
Why?

309
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,340
<i>Doctor Zhivago</i>
is my favorite film.

310
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,780
Ugh, my god,

311
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,340
what is going on
with this storm?

312
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,110
I'm, like, make up your mind.

313
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,350
I want it to start,
like, pouring again

314
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,350
so that we can go fucking crazy.

315
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,620
Oh, you know that has
weed in it, right?

316
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,660
Not a lot,
I just wanted to let you know.

317
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,660
Just didn't want you
to go to town and then...

318
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,250
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

319
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,660

Okay?

365
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,090
You should watch your girl.

366
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,760

What? Stop!

386
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,600
Who wants to play
bodies bodies bodies?

387
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,030
- Ah, fuck!
- Yes!

388
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,100
So, if you draw
the piece of paper

389
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,770
that has the "x" on it,

390
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,770
you are the murderer.

391
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,610
And you have
to keep it a secret.

392
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,240
Guys, I get so stressed out
every time we play this.

393
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,640
Someone always ends up crying.

394
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,010
You always
end up crying.

395
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,950
Okay, I can access
my emotions easily.

396
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,720
Very incredibly easily.

397
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,620
She's an actress,
she always cries first.

398
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,820
I'm just saying,
this game gets very ugly.

399
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,520
Oh, my god, no, it does not.

400
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,930
It gets ugly
when she ugly cries.

401
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,930
Literally, every single
time we play,

402
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
people start fighting.

403
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,030
Yeah, well, that's
what makes it fun, Emma.

404
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,040
Where's Max?

405
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,770
He's not responding to my texts.

406
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,040
Oh, Jesus...

407
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,320
So, how do you play?

408
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,220
So, I'm gonna
hit the lights in a second.

409
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,850
And if you are the murderer,

410
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,290
you have to sneak around
and kill someone

411
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,660
by, like, touching them
on the back.

412
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,260
And then, everyone else
has to avoid being killed.

413
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,130
And then, if you are killed,

414
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,330
you have to fall down
and pretend you're dead.

415
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,900
Like this.

416
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,970
Cool.

417
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,970
Hey, uh...
Alice, do you wanna...

418
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,040
- What?
- Do you wanna...

419
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,540
- You know.
- Oh! Excuse me, I have to go.

420
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,250
It's an emergency.

421
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,880
Excuse me.

422
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,060
The most important part

423
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,050
is if you do come across a body,

424
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,020
you have to yell,
"bodies, bodies, bodies."

425
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,260
And then, once that happens,

426
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,620
we'll turn all
the lights back on

427
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,960
and then we'll try
to figure out who did it.

428
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,290
Could you hold this?

429
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,900
Did Greg touch that?

430
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,960
Oh, my god.

431
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,900
You're being such a dick
about Greg.

432
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,330
Just hold this.

433
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,640
David...

434
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,240
What?
I, ugh...

435
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,080
Okay...

436
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,820
Look, what the fuck's going on?

437
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,250
Come to the floor.

438
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,320
Come to the floor.

439
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,320
Get your ass
over here, boy.

440
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,720
- Okay.
- All right.

441
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,960
Who will do the honors?

442
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,160
Oh...

443
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,600
Get into it. Let's go.

444
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,700
Ow!

445
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,230
Ahhh!

446
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,140
Bitch.

447
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,200
Are you mad at me?

448
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,520
- No.
- Okay.

449
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,670
- Ow!
- Jordan!

450
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,040
- Whoa.
- What? It's the game.

451
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,310
Wowza...

452
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,430
- Oh, my god...
- Oh, come on!

453
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,700
- What was that?
- Bee!

454
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,740
- You have to hit more.
- You got to put

455
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,800
- some muscle into it.
- You gotta... Yeah, go for it.

456
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,840
Yeah.

457
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,710
Come on!

458
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,820
Slap him around,
he deserves it.

459
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,810
Fucking hit me!

460
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,910
- He wants it.
- No, he deserves it.

461
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,880
He really deserves it. Do it.

462
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,290
If anyone deserves
to be hit, it should be him.

463
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,150
- Yeah.
- Okay.

464
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,850
Oh, for fuck sake like this.

465
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,420
Oh, my god!

466
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,290
- David!
- David.

467
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,190
- See?
- David.

468
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,890
You're a fucking dick!

469
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,390
What?

470
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,130
You are such an asshole.

471
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,310
I'm teaching her
how to play the game.

472
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,760
Baby, stop, stop!

473
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,800
Wait, guys,
someone has to hit me.

474
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,370
Who's gonna hit me?

475
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,670
I'll do it.

476
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,770
Ow!

477
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,710
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

478
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,740
Okay!

479
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,780
- Are we ready to go?
- Yes, let's fucking go.

480
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,330
- Yes.
- Let's play the game.

481
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,090
Holy shit!
I'm so fucked up.

482
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,220
Ahh.

483
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,960
You ready?

484
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,330
Yes.

485
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,100
Hey.

486
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,200
Oh!

487
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,980
I see white man...

488
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,590
Bodies, bodies, bodies!

489
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,560
You guys! Over here.

490
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,360
No!

491
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,200
All right,
who tried to take advantage

492
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,030
of my body in the dark?

493
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,500
Your wish, babe.

494
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,270
Oh, why, god?
Why? He was so hot!

495
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,180
- Was it you?
- No.

496
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:52,050
Okay. So, do we have
any nominations?

497
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,550
- Emma
- whoa.

498
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,550
- Wow, coming in hot.
- What?

499
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,190
- Why?
- Yup, I think it was Emma.

500
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,990
Why do you think it was me?

501
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,190
Yeah, David, why?

502
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,660
Okay, well,
she just, like,

503
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,390
agrees with everything
that everybody is saying.

504
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,590
And that's her strategy
in this game

505
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,300
and it works every single time.

506
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,960
So, I'm just calling it now.
It's Emma.

507
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,930
Do we have
any other nominations?

508
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,100
Um... yeah, David.

509
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,650
Oh, come on.
It's low hanging fruit.

510
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,370
I mean, he who casts
the first stone.

511
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,140
Guys,
why isn't he moving?

512
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,480
- Greg?
- Baby, get up.

513
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,280
You don't have to keep
pretending for this long.

514
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,920
Baby?
Come on, Greg.

515
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:30,950
Greg...

516
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,490
Greg...

517
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,520
Get up.

518
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,460
Wait.

519
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,460
Greg?

520
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,200
Greg!

521
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,700
Greg, get up!

522
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,130
Greg! He's not getting up.

523
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,500
Hey, relax,
this always works. I know.

524
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,140
- Oh, hey!
- Oh, my god.

525
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,140
You really scared me with that.

526
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,250
You're a little
trickster, Greg.

527
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,950
I know, Jesus Christ.

528
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,020
Cute.

529
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,720
Okay, so... what about David?

530
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,020
Alice:

531
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,520
Wait, maybe it's Jordan.

532
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,630
She's always really aggressive
when she's the killer.

533
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,020
- There you go.
- What? No, I am not.

534
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,030
You're lying.

535
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,030
Your voice always goes
really high when you lie.

536
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,030
No, it doesn't.
I... it... I've...

537
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,100
- It's definitely David.
- Why are you yelling?

538
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,310
That would be so fucking obvious

539
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,130
if I were the killer,
which I'm not.

540
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,280
I think you're digging yourself

541
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,740
into a little hole here, Dave.

542
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,370
Guys, Jesus Christ...

543
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,240
The best defense
is a good offense.

544
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,550
Hey, you shut up. You're not
supposed to talk. You're dead.

545
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,650
The dead are actually
not supposed to speak.

546
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,460
Oh, yeah, you... sorry, baby,
you can't. It's a rule.

547
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,510
- Oh, my b.
- Yeah, no talking. Pack it up.

548
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,390
What the fuck
does that even mean, Greg?

549
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,050
What's up?

550
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,090
"The best defense
is a good offense."

551
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,090
What does that...
What does that mean?

552
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,330
Oh, you know, the best defense
is a good offense.

553
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,460
What...
What does it mean, though?

554
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,270
Uh, well...

555
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,570
It, um... it means
that the best defense

556
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,340
is a good offense.

557
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,410
Right, right, I heard you.

558
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,750
But, what does it mean
to you, Greg? Like...

559
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,580
I don't know, could you
elaborate on it for us?

560
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,120
Break it down.

561
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,620
Yeah, sure.

562
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,090
So, hey, look in sports,
there's...

563
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,460
Oh, my god.

564
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,090
You are such a fucking dick.

565
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,490
Hey, this is a teaching moment.

566
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,500
Oh, I see.

567
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,770
You're fucking with me.

568
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,740
No. No,

569
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,200
I'm not fucking with you, Greg.

570
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,440
I'm just having fun.

571
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,670
We're all just
having a good time.

572
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,080
Right, guys?

573
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,010
Right, Greg?

574
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,720
We're just having fun.

575
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,700
You know,

576
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,170
I think it's time for me
to put myself to bed.

577
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,170
- Oh, come on, Greg.
- Greg, no.

578
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,540
Good night, Greg.

579
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,380
You kids have fun.

580
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,080
Catch you later, player.

581
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,210
By the way,

582
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,120
can I just point
all of our attention

583
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,520
to the fact that Emma
hasn't said a fucking word.

584
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,760
Whoa, you're right.

585
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,820
Whoa, she hasn't!

586
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,360
I'm just pointing out
the obvious. That's all.

587
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,160
Look, she's doing
that swallowing thing.

588
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,600
She always does that
when she's fucking nervous!

589
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,640
- Oh, my god!
- Look, look!

590
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,170
Oh, my god, you're doing it.
You're swallowing it.

591
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,130
- I'm not.
- You are.

592
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,800
Okay, I love you,
but when you swallow,

593
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,300
it's just fucking...
Like, why?

594
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,540
Swallowing is normal.

595
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,680
- It's a normal thing to do.
- Yeah...

596
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,620
It's very UN-attractive.
I don't know why you do it?

597
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,110
Oh, my god. Is that why
you guys never have sex?

598
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,250
- What?
- Alice.

599
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,380
What? It's not a bad thing.
Some people have sex a lot.

600
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,350
Some people have it less.

601
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,260
Alice, what are you
talking about? We do.

602
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,190
I have it a lot. Some...

603
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,500
- Are you fucking...
- Oh, my god.

604
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,410
Are you fucking talking
about us behind my back?

605
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,860
- No.
- Yes.

606
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,200
- No.
- Yes.

607
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,300
No, I'm not.

608
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,530
I'm not! I'm not.

609
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,580
- I just...
- That's just great.

610
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,240
No, I... we...
I... you never really... I...

611
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,170
I don't...
You're always gaslighting me.

612
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,820
"Gaslight," shut up.
It's a fucking dumb word.

613
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,010
Excuse me?

614
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,650
Gaslight is, like, one of
the most over used words ever,

615
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,880
to, like, the point
of annihilation.

616
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,320
Okay, it doesn't mean
anything other than the fact

617
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,820
that, like,
you read the Internet.

618
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,320
Or, like, "congrats,
you have a Twitter account."

619
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,490
Ugh, that is so fucking lame.

620
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,600
"Gaslight,"
get over it.

621
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,430
Like what's next?
You're gonna call me a narcissist?

622
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,260
Or a foot soldier of,
like, the white supremacy?

623
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,300
Like, come on, fucking,
be more original.

624
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,570
Lame.

625
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,610
What? I'm just saying,
that, this is what I'm saying,

626
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,380
she doesn't have a thought
in her fucking head

627
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,210
that hasn't been said
by anybody else.

628
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,880
Nothing that isn't preordained.

629
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,440
David,
that's really mean.

630
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,180
Look, she's crying.

631
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,380
What?

632
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,590
Why is everybody
looking at me like that?

633
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,550
This is not her real cry.

634
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,720
I vote David.

635
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,220
Yeah, me too.

636
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,930
Are you fucking serious?

637
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,260
Guys, it's Emma.

638
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,800
She's an actress.
She's acting.

639
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,600
Third.

640
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,530
Wow,
how fucking surprising.

641
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,500
Yeah, look at your
quivering upper lip.

642
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,670
Like, we all didn't see you
in <i>hedda gabler.</i> Fuck you.

643
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,470
Yeah, yeah, yup... fourth.

644
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,910
Oh, my god.

645
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,310
Fuck this game!

646
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,350
Holy shit.

647
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,690
Relationships can
be really complicated.

648
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,490
Are you okay?

649
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,890
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

650
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,430
- I'm fine. I'm 100% fine.
- Are you sure, baby?

651
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,930
Yes. Let's play.

652
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,830
Ow!

653
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,500
Wow, good one.

654
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,470
All of a sudden
she loves the game.

655
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,670
That was crazy.

656
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,210
Give it to me.

657
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,610
Damn!

658
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,880
Ah! Oh, my god!

659
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,950
What was that?

660
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,730
- What the fuck?
- Is that the lights?

661
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,790
What was that?

662
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,790
- Oh, my god.
- Was that from the storm?

663
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,830
Oh, my god.
I bet you that it was David.

664
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,560
- David!
- It's not David. Come on.

665
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,630
I'm texting him.

666
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,530
David, are you fucking with us?

667
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,030
Turn the lights back on.

668
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,830
Hey, does anybody have service?

669
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,930
No!

670
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,600
Ugh, wait, mine's not working.

671
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,440
Okay, I think
the WiFi is also down.

672
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,740
Oh, my god, i'm
gonna fucking kill him.

673
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,370
- Great!
- David!

674
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,810
David! This is
real fucking cute!

675
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,890
Soph, can he disable
the generator from garage,

676
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,820
or the basement, or whatever?

677
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,850
I don't know.

678
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,390
David!

679
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,560
Okay, well, I'm gonna
go and flip the breaker.

680
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,300
Is it in the garage
or is it in the basement?

681
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,530
- David!
- Soph?

682
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,770
- Huh, what?
- Okay, whatever.

683
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
Okay, I'm gonna go
get some more flashlights.

684
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,570
I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

685
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Where is a bathroom?

686
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,710
Um, uh, downstairs,
first door on your right.

687
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,640
Going there.

688
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,780
David?

689
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,420
David, are you fucking with us?

690
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,090
I meant the other stairs.

691
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,130
David! David!

692
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,700
Help! Somebody help!

693
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,130
No, no, no.

694
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,940
What the fuck happened?

695
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,710
Oh, my god! Why would...

696
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,110
- Check his pulse.
- What the fuck?

697
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,040
- Oh, fuck!
- Oh, my god!

698
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,140
Hold his head up!

699
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,850
- Oh, my god!
- Fuck!

700
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,180
- Fuck!
- Is he dying?

701
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,620
- Hold his head up!
- Come on, baby, hold on.

702
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,160
What the fuck
happened to his neck?

703
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,860
I love you, David.
Shit.

704
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,820
What is happening?

705
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,090
Shit!

706
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,830
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling 911!

707
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,030
Oh, my god! You have service?

708
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,560
Fuck, no! Do you?

709
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,770
- No!
- Shit!

710
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,600
- Where are you going?
- Landline!

711
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,070
We should move his body?

712
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,540
- Why?
- I don't know. Because he's...

713
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,770
No, you can't move him.

714
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,570
Did you watch <i>svu?</i>
It's evidence.

715
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,640
- Of what?
- Cause!

716
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,610
- Landline?
- No, there's no connection.

717
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,450
Sophie, where are your keys?

718
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,820
Your keys, Sophie,
where are they?

719
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:23,780
They're in the pocket.

720
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,650
- They're in her pocket...
- Where? Fucking help!

721
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,650
Where are you going?

722
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,990
- I'm going to the car.
- To the car? Why?

723
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,590
To get some fucking help.

724
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,990
Wait, do you have a license?

725
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,460
Doesn't she not have a license?

726
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,000
I don't know.
I don't think so.

727
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,860
- Fuck!
- He's dead!

728
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,630
- You have to go!
- I don't know!

729
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,940
He stopped breathing!

730
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,990
Branch!

731
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,920
You have
to push the gas.

732
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,050
I know how
to fucking drive, Alice!

733
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,920
- I can't see.
- Is the battery dead?

734
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:37,520
- Oh, no...
- What?

735
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,960
I, I think I left the light on,
on the mirror.

736
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,760
Oh, Jesus Christ.

737
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,560
What the fuck
are we supposed to do?

738
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,100
Wait,
where are your cars?

739
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,840
We...
We only have one car.

740
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,570
Max picked us all up
and he fucking left!

741
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,010
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

742
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,620
Max will probably
be here any minute, right?

743
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,760
Where's Jordan?

744
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,090
She went to check
the generator, I...

745
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,200
What the fuck was he doing?

746
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,270
- What are you talking about?
- Fuck was he doing?

747
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,900
Why the fuck was he
outside in the storm?

748
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,010
Hey!
It's me, let me in!

749
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,190
I found this.

750
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,920
Outside in the mud.

751
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,230
Don't touch it

752
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,030
um, does the security system
work if the power goes out?

753
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,770
Um...

754
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it does.

755
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,770
David's dad explained it to us.

756
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,920
Nobody can get in
without the code.

757
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,110
Well, Max has the code.

758
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,110
- So...
- Max wouldn't...

759
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,150
I'm just saying, like,
where the fuck is he?

760
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,020
Couldn't he have come back
after last night?

761
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,620
Alice, stop.

762
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,160
What happened last night?

763
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,760
- Nothing.
- No.

764
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,260
We did shrooms

765
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,760
and Max told everybody
that he was in love with Emma.

766
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,060
Which David thought
was beautiful in the moment,

767
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,800
but maybe not today.

768
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,940
Alice, that literally doesn't
fucking matter at all.

769
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:30,640
Where is Greg? Where is he?

770
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,210
- What?
- Where is Greg?

771
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,270
I...

772
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,940
He said he was going to bed.

773
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,680
So my guess would be
that he's sleeping.

774
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,050
Okay, don't you think
it's a little bit strange

775
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,950
that he hasn't, like,
woken up yet?

776
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,610
Jordan,

777
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,080
what are you trying to say.

778
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,690
Maybe we should
just go check on him.

779
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,950
No, no, no.

780
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,130
Jordan...

781
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,890
What are you doing?
Jordan... Jordan.

782
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,060
What are you doing!

783
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,400
- I'm staying safe.
- Really?

784
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,510
Because it looks like
you're grabbing

785
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,800
a fucking meat cleaver
to go look for my boyfriend!

786
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,400
Wow. Boyfriend?

787
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,880
That's the first time
I've heard you call him that.

788
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,940
That's crazy.

789
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,120
Don't be such a bitch.

790
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,320
Alice, I'm literally
just protecting myself, okay?

791
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,110
Let me remind you,
our friend is dead.

792
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,420
So, if you could just, like,
not escalate the situation...

793
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,250
I'm not escalating.
You're holding the knife

794
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,790
and you're moving your hands
while you talk.

795
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,620
Alice, how long
have you known Greg?

796
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,750
Like...

797
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,120
Long.

798
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,130
Alice.

799
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,130
Ugh...

800
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,400
I don't know exactly how long.

801
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,930
I... Like...

802
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,940
Two weeks.

803
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,100
Okay, uh...

804
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,700
What do you know
about Greg, Alice?

805
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,770
Oh, my god.

806
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,920
What do you
know about him?

807
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,180
Oh, my god, guys!

808
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:42,290
- Oh, my god!
- Relax. Stop!

809
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,850
Stop! Stop! I know that
he's a good person, okay?

810
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,380
He's fundamentally
a good person.

811
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,950
He wouldn't do this. Like, no.

812
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,960
Do you know his middle name?
Do you know where he lives?

813
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,820
Do you know how much
fucking money he makes?

814
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,490
Do you know
his last name, Alice?

815
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,990
I know a lot.

816
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,360
Our first date was at...
Was at a bar.

817
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,160
He drank, like,
a medium amount...

818
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,300
- Okay, Alice... stop.
- He likes nature.

819
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,300
What is his
middle name?

820
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,230
- He's a libra moon.
- Where does he live?

821
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,310
You don't ask
what your middle name is!

822
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:06,230
- Okay? For a really long time.
- Oh... fuck!

823
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,800
He's a libra moon.
That says a lot!

824
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,000
Fuck!

825
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,380
- Greg!
- Shh!

826
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,020
What? You just said
we're looking for Greg!

827
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,120
Okay, well
don't fucking, Alice...

828
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,290
Greg! Can you come
into the kitchen?

829
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,380
We need you for a second.

830
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,450
- Shut up.
- Stop waving the knife at me!

831
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,820
- Fuck.
- You're making me...

832
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,350
Stop. Stop. Greg!

833
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,850
- Stop. Just stop.
- Just be quiet.

834
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:28,920
Stop. Stop.

835
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,790
- Greg! Don't.
- Relax.

836
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,260
- Don't grab my mouth.
- Relax. Relax. Relax.

837
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,960
- You're silencing me.
- Oh, my god.

838
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,760
- Get the fuck off.
- Okay, stop.

839
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,430
Don't grab me
like that again.

840
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,300
And she came at me with a knife.

841
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,300
- I'm sorry...
- Back off.

842
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,440
Okay, buck!

843
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,040
Wait, where's Emma?

844
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,110
Oh, my god.

845
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,290
Emma?

846
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,860
Emma?

847
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:08,230
Guys,

848
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,060
maybe Emma could have done it.

849
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,210
She was really pissed at David.

850
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,310
Alice, what the fuck?

851
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:13,380
Emma wouldn't do that.

852
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,300
She was devastated.

853
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:16,340
She's having, like,
a full-on panic attack.

854
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:17,970
Yeah, but she's an actress.

855
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,910
She's acting.
Remember <i>hedda gabler?</i>

856
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,870
Okay, not to be mean,

857
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,910
but she wasn't that good
in <i>hedda gabler.</i>

858
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,460
This is my room.

859
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,860
So open it.

860
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,970
You open it.

861
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,070
What happened to,
"Greg would never do this?"

862
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,040
- He wouldn't.
- Okay, so open it.

863
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,470
I will in one second.

864
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,370
I'm going to.

865
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,280
He's not here.

866
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,920
Soph, are there any guns
in the house?

867
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,990
Guns?

868
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,690
No. No way.

869
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,130
David's dad can be a dick,
but his politics check out.

870
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,240
Guys...

871
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,380
What the fuck is this?

872
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,550
Uh... but...

873
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:43,920
He wanted to be prepared
for the hurricane. He...

874
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,600
Why did he circle
the fucking house

875
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,060
on his fucking map?

876
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,820
We have to
find Emma before he does.

877
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,100
Okay.

878
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,540
Let's check
my room next.

879
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,470
I don't think
he's hiding in my bra.

880
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:38,380
Guys...

881
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,610
Come here.

882
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,530
Oh, my god, Emma.

883
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,970
Emma.

884
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,170
Are you okay?

885
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,010
What's going on?
What are you guys doing?

886
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,340
You scared me what's happening?

887
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,640
It's so hot in here.

888
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:09,680
What is that?

889
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:11,650
- Xanax. Do you want one?
- Yeah, give me one.

890
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:15,220
- You want one?
- No.

891
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,620
Hey, you take this.

892
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:19,150
- Why?
- I'm gonna find Greg.

893
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,560
Greg, why? Where's Max?

894
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:24,290
Maybe Max did it.
Maybe he is here.

895
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,590
Max was really angry at David.

896
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,670
I'm serious,
he looked like he was gonna

897
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:27,590
do something really fucked up.

898
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,260
- Alice! Shut up.
- I'm just saying.

899
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,560
Max would never.

900
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,270
Let's go find Greg.

901
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,670
Okay.

902
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,220
What the...

903
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,500
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my god.

904
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,330
What the hell
is on his face?

905
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:08,170
It's his light therapy mask.
He has seasonal depression.

906
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,400
Let's go.

907
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,090
Hey... shh...

908
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,100
Greg.

909
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:50,440
- What's up?
- Where have you been?

910
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,650
Huh?

911
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,750
Where have you been?

912
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,580
Oh, I, uh...

913
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,750
I couldn't sleep,

914
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,320
so I came down here
to do my exercises.

915
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:00,590
Why didn't
you answer me?

916
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:01,790
Were you calling for me?

917
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,190
Yeah.

918
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,230
I... I had my headphones in.

919
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,170
Are you guys
still playing werewolf?

920
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,240
Greg!

921
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:19,670
Stop! Stop it!

922
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:25,880
All right.

923
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:27,710
What am I supposed to do, huh?

924
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,280
Why don't you tell us,
fucking Greg?

925
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,550
Is that my go bag?
Is that a knife?

926
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:32,890
Why did you bring a go bag?

927
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,260
- The hurricane?
- See, I told you.

928
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:36,470
Why did you circle
the fucking house

929
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:37,560
on your fucking map?

930
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,860
- What's going on?
- David is dead.

931
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,430
His body is outside.

932
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,760
David's body. Wait, what?

933
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,270
Why did you kill David?

934
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,900
You murdered my boyfriend.

935
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:50,740
No, no. David killed me.
Right?

936
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:52,570
This isn't
a joke, Greg.

937
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:54,910
David is dead.
Somebody slit his throat.

938
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,740
- What?
- With a fucking sword,

939
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,410
you fucking sick fuck!

940
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,780
Oh...

941
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,150
You guys are fucking with me?

942
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:12,660
Oh, you guys
are fucking with me.

943
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,760
Fuck!

944
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,160
Cute.

945
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,600
No!

946
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:22,400
Okay.

947
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,880
Everyone needs
to take a deep breath.

948
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:25,710
Alice.

949
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,820
Give me my knife back!

950
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,680
What the fuck is going on?

951
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,850
I don't know!

952
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,750
- Put down the weapons.
- You put it down.

953
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,210
Now!

954
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,920
On the floor!

955
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:38,860
Okay, okay.
How about this?

956
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,230
- Put it down.
- Okay, okay, okay.

957
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,520
Okay, we'll put them down.

958
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:42,830
We'll put... we'll all
put them down.

959
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,780
Right? We'll put them down
if you put yours down.

960
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:46,660
We'll put them down.

961
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,960
Okay.

962
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,900
- Okay.
- Yeah, please, please.

963
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:53,500
- That seems fair.
- Yeah.

964
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,470
Okay.

965
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,600
Putting it down.

966
00:47:57,870 --> 00:47:59,470
- We're good.
- Yeah.

967
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:01,240
Okay, this is good.

968
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:03,340
All right.

969
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,720
- Jordan!
- Are you okay?

970
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,320
- Ow!
- Stop! Stop!

971
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,650
- Please stop!
- Alice?

972
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:16,290
Stop. Stop!

973
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,520
No! No!

974
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,230
- Sophie! No.
- No, no, no, Sophie!

975
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,230
Mother fucker.

976
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:12,380
Oh, my god.

977
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,580
Oh, my god.

978
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:40,740
This isn't right.

979
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:44,440
He didn't do it.

980
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,410
- Alice, how do you know?
- How do you that know he did?

981
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:49,780
Look, I mean, like...

982
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:52,620
If you look at all of us, like,

983
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,360
on paper, logically,

984
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:57,860
he is the most likely
to commit an act of violence.

985
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:59,430
On paper?

986
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:03,560
What the fuck
are you even talking about?

987
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,430
I mean, he's the only one

988
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,430
who served in the military,
right? So...

989
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:08,640
What?

990
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:11,970
He's a vet.

991
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:13,710
Right? Like Iraq? Or...

992
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,440
No, I thought
it was Afghanistan.

993
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,010
He was a veterinarian.

994
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,810
He was
a veterinarian's assistant.

995
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,920
Are you fucking
serious right now?

996
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:24,120
Then why did
you call him g.I. Joe?

997
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:26,990
Because... have you seen him?

998
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,990
Well, regardless, either way,

999
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:32,960
like, out of all of us,
he is the biggest unknown.

1000
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:34,490
We've known each other forever.

1001
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:36,930
Jordan, what are
you trying to do?

1002
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,840
I'm not...
I'm not trying to do anything.

1003
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:41,070
He's dead, okay?

1004
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,970
He's dead. We killed him.

1005
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,470
She killed him.

1006
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,620
Go change your shirt.

1007
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:04,990
We need to leave.
We need to get out of here.

1008
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:06,390
We don't have a car.

1009
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,130
- Okay, I'm going to walk.
- Emma, stop.

1010
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,270
What do you mean?
You can't just fucking...

1011
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,600
Emma, you're literally
in the middle of nowhere.

1012
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:13,030
Where are you going?

1013
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,410
I mean, it could
have been any of us.

1014
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:29,680
We all scattered
when the lights went out.

1015
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,690
I mean, it could
have been Max, okay?

1016
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,750
Alice, you don't know
what you are talking about.

1017
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:37,420
He punched David in the face
because of you.

1018
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,160
Just because Max
is in love with me

1019
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:40,830
doesn't mean
he would kill David.

1020
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,730
Oh, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

1021
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,470
What?

1022
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,600
This is not about you and Max.

1023
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,100
Why are you being so mean?

1024
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,970
Because I'm upset, Emma.

1025
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:54,110
I'm upset because somebody
killed my best friend.

1026
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,640
Sophie, did you use?
I can believe you're making

1027
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,650
this about you.

1028
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,150
I'm sad, too, okay?
I'm scared, too.

1029
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,480
I loved him so much.

1030
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,990
It didn't seem like it.

1031
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:07,790
- What?
- It seemed like

1032
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,060
you loved having a boyfriend.

1033
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:10,560
And you loved
feeling comfortable.

1034
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:12,760
But, no, you did not love him.

1035
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:14,460
You didn't even
fucking like him.

1036
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:16,040
You were just too scared
to do anything about it.

1037
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,240
So you stayed for three years
longer than you should have

1038
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:19,670
because you're a coward.

1039
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,530
No, I'm not.

1040
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,900
No, I'm not.

1041
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,140
I'm not.

1042
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,210
I'm not. Right? I...

1043
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:30,980
You're... you're so toxic.

1044
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:32,180
- Emma, calm down.
- You are.

1045
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:33,610
No! No, I'm not gonna...

1046
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,180
You are so toxic.

1047
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,950
And, honestly, when you fell
off the face of the earth,

1048
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:39,990
David was relieved.

1049
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:43,720
He was relieved he didn't
have to deal with you anymore.

1050
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,530
I wish they had chopped off
your head instead,

1051
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,760
you spineless piece of shit.

1052
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:48,630
Sophie.

1053
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,900
Jesus fucking Christ.

1054
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:53,030
Emma.

1055
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,940
Emma, come on. Wait.

1056
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:56,770
- Wait.
- Emma.

1057
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,910
Emma.

1058
00:52:58,310 --> 00:52:59,610
Emma.

1059
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:02,040
That was
real nice, soph.

1060
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,680
Guys...

1061
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,150
Where the fuck is bee?

1062
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,000
Emma.

1063
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:39,670
I'm so sorry.

1064
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,080
I'm so sorry.

1065
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:42,340
I'm really sorry.

1066
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,640
I'm so fucked up right now.

1067
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,950
I'm sorry.

1068
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:49,180
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1069
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,140
Okay? It was just, like,
things started coming...

1070
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,990
Isn't that what you wanted?

1071
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,010
Yeah, Emma,
that's what I wanted.

1072
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:03,110
That's what I was
in the mood for.

1073
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:05,100
Thank you very much.
What the fuck?

1074
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:06,770
Jesus Christ!

1075
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,140
You always think everyone
is in love with you.

1076
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:09,340
- It's so crazy.
- I...

1077
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:11,940
I'm sorry.

1078
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:13,040
I'm sorry.

1079
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:14,140
Do you want this?

1080
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,280
Yeah.

1081
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:18,640
Thank you.

1082
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,780
Sure.

1083
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,660
Bee?

1084
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:44,740
Soph?

1085
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:09,760
Emma?

1086
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:20,900
Help!

1087
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,240
Jordan!

1088
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:23,840
Help!

1089
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:25,840
- Help.
- Where are you?

1090
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:27,340
Help! Please, help! Help!

1091
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:30,280
Help! Help! Help!

1092
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:33,010
Emma.

1093
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,190
- Oh, my god.
- Emma.

1094
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:36,420
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

1095
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:38,120
- What happened?
- I don't know!

1096
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:39,350
I don't know.

1097
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:44,020
- Don't touch her!
- I'm just trying to...

1098
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,470
- Don't. No!
- Figure out what happened.

1099
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:47,100
How am I supposed
to know if I don't touch her?

1100
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,790
Don't, just don't,
just don't.

1101
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,130
Oh, fuck.

1102
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,230
Oh, my god.

1103
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,070
I heard something.

1104
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,870
Um, maybe she...

1105
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:00,840
Oh, my god.

1106
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:02,840
- She fell, maybe she tripped?
- No.

1107
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,050
No, no. She...

1108
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,210
She... she got pushed, okay?

1109
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,820
She was pushed.
I told you it wasn't Greg!

1110
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:11,420
Are you happy
that she's dead?

1111
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:14,020
No, but I told you
it wasn't Greg!

1112
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,130
I did... I did tell you.

1113
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,210
Don't you see
what's happening?

1114
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,240
What?

1115
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,440
Who was the killer?

1116
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,510
What?

1117
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:41,420
Who was the killer?

1118
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:43,050
In the game?

1119
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,120
It's following the same pattern.

1120
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:47,150
The deaths.

1121
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,920
Please... please,
just stop talking, please!

1122
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,090
David, Greg, Emma.

1123
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,630
David, Greg, Emma.

1124
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:54,090
- No.
- Yes!

1125
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,370
- Fucking yes, Jordan!
- No.

1126
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,960
No, it's not
following the same pattern.

1127
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,170
Greg died and then
we executed David.

1128
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,570
But in real life,
David died and then we...

1129
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:08,540
Okay, but Greg, David, Emma.
Greg, David, Emma.

1130
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:10,250
I mean, why else would
somebody leave her there

1131
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,550
unless they wanted us
to find her?

1132
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,110
Why would they want us
to find her?

1133
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:16,150
Because they're playing
a sick fucking game.

1134
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,090
Okay?

1135
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,050
Who was the killer?
I wasn't the killer.

1136
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,050
Alice, you're fucking coked out.

1137
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:23,460
You're coked out, okay?
We're all coked out.

1138
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:25,060
I'm not.

1139
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:26,290
I'm not.

1140
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,400
Are you wearing make up?

1141
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,600
I... I was upstairs,
changing my...

1142
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:34,170
You look weird.

1143
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,540
Whose sweater is this?

1144
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:37,900
I found it upstairs.

1145
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:40,220
How long have you known her?

1146
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,480
Stop, Alice.

1147
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:44,410
Who are you?

1148
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:47,610
What?
You show up here,

1149
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,650
start smiling at my boyfriend.

1150
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,020
What are you talking about?

1151
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:54,120
Your voice is trembling.

1152
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:56,060
- No. No.
- Yeah. It is.

1153
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:57,220
I googled you.

1154
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,930
And there was nobody
with your name

1155
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,060
who graduated
from Utah state this year.

1156
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,970
There's literally no record
of your attendance, at all.

1157
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,070
What the fuck?

1158
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,470
Listen, I can explain.

1159
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,970
Oh, my god.

1160
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,510
You discovered David's body.

1161
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:12,720
- No, I just...
- You could have tampered

1162
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:13,640
with the generator,

1163
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:15,150
just like you tampered
with Sophie's car.

1164
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:16,110
You said you
left the lights on, right?

1165
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,310
- Are you serious?
- We watched you kill someone.

1166
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:20,410
You literally murdered Greg!

1167
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,680
Literally!

1168
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,550
Literally! You sick fuck!

1169
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:25,650
No, are you crazy? No.
Calm down.

1170
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:28,020
- Let's just talk about it.
- Talk about it?

1171
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:29,460
- Yeah.
- No... no.

1172
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:31,160
Let's just talk
about it, okay?

1173
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:32,330
Mmm-mmm. I don't want to.

1174
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,090
- Sophie... Sophie.
- No!

1175
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,570
- Sophie.
- Do not touch her!

1176
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,330
Whoa!

1177
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,470
You know what?
I don't...

1178
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,530
I don't want you in here.

1179
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:40,630
Okay, calm down.

1180
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:41,700
No, seriously.
Alice!

1181
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:42,980
- Alice!
- I don't want you in here.

1182
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,970
- I... relax.
- Just shut up! Shut up!

1183
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:46,310
I don't want you in here.

1184
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:47,650
- Get out of this room!
- Let go of me, Alice.

1185
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:48,750
Get the fuck out of this room!

1186
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,420
I don't want to look
at your face anymore. Get out.

1187
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,520
- Alice, calm down.
- I'm not...

1188
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:53,020
- I'm not calming down.
- Let go of me, Alice.

1189
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:55,120
No, you killed
my fucking boyfriend.

1190
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:56,690
- You know what? You know what?
- It was self-defense.

1191
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,760
I... I want her out.

1192
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,290
- Jordan, can you help me?
- All right.

1193
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,690
- Jordan!
- Jesus, Alice.

1194
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,120
Get the fucking door!

1195
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,620
Jesus fucking Christ!

1196
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,130
I do not want her in here!

1197
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,260
- Relax!
- No!

1198
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:08,200
- Relax!
- No!

1199
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:10,360
Sophie! Sophie, do something!

1200
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,070
You killed him, get out!

1201
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:13,470
- Sophie!
- Get out!

1202
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,610
Sophie!

1203
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:42,880
Stay here.

1204
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:25,390
I'm so hungry.

1205
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:26,460
How can you
be hungry right now?

1206
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:27,630
I wasn't
planning on this.

1207
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:29,490
Alice...

1208
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,860
- What the fuck?
- How the fuck you get in here?

1209
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:33,490
She has a gun.

1210
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:36,260
Jordan has a gun
in her pocket, Sophie,

1211
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,500
get away from her.

1212
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:38,710
No, no, Sophie,
she's confusing...

1213
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:39,800
Let go of me.

1214
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:41,470
Are you kidding me?

1215
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,800
I don't have a gun.

1216
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,700
Then empty your pockets.

1217
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:47,840
Slowly!

1218
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,290
That's it?

1219
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,520
That's it.

1220
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,260
Oh, my god.

1221
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:06,660
You are the killer.

1222
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:10,760
In the... in the game... I...

1223
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,330
How the fuck
did you get in here?

1224
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:13,980
- Where is the gun?
- I don't have a fucking gun.

1225
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,940
We locked all the doors.
How did you get in?

1226
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:18,010
You killed him.

1227
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,570
Why would I kill David?
Why would I kill David?

1228
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:21,470
Why would I kill Emma?

1229
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:22,410
They are, literally,
my oldest friends.

1230
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,580
You just fucking met them!
How dare you?

1231
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:25,710
When I found David,

1232
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:28,310
you were the last person
to get there.

1233
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:31,320
- It took you awhile.
- That's true.

1234
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:33,750
Where were you
when Emma died, hmm?

1235
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:35,390
- You pushed her!
- Shut up!

1236
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:36,770
Guy's, don't listen to her.
You don't know what the fuck

1237
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:38,490
- you're talking about!
- And then, I saw you.

1238
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:39,860
I saw you getting the gun.

1239
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:40,960
That's a lie.

1240
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,330
That's a fucking lie.
You're lying. You're a liar!

1241
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,030
You're lying through
your fucking teeth.

1242
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:45,900
You lied about everything.

1243
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:47,470
You lied about
everything to Sophie.

1244
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,070
You're a fucking liar.

1245
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:51,370
Yeah, you...
You did lie to Sophie.

1246
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:57,040
Okay.

1247
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:00,410
Okay.

1248
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,520
I did go to Utah state

1249
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:08,960
for one semester.

1250
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:13,030
But my mom was...
She was having a hard time

1251
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:14,790
and I came home
to take care of her.

1252
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,030
And I did work at gamehut,

1253
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,740
but they shut down
our location, like,

1254
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:25,040
a week after I met you. I...
I've been applying, but...

1255
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:26,410
What were you doing
when I dropped

1256
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,570
you off at the mall?

1257
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:34,680
Hung out at
the food court. I...

1258
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:39,750
Didn't want to disappoint you.

1259
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:45,860
I was embarrassed.

1260
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,070
I should have told you.
I just...

1261
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:55,870
My mom, she...

1262
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:59,110
She has...

1263
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:03,440
My mom has borderline.

1264
01:08:04,110 --> 01:08:05,680
Oh, my god.

1265
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:08,850
I'm so sorry, that's...

1266
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,150
That's really serious.

1267
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:13,050
Mental health
is a really serious issue.

1268
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:15,920
I mean, I've never actually
said this to anyone, but...

1269
01:08:18,790 --> 01:08:19,870
But I have body dysmorphia.

1270
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:21,900
Oh, my god.
Shut the fuck up, Alice.

1271
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:26,100
I wanted to tell you.
I just...

1272
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:32,070
I just really wanted
you to like me.

1273
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:44,680
You've got to
be fucking kidding me.

1274
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:48,990
Oh, my god.

1275
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:49,920
Jordan, what the fuck?

1276
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,230
Are you telling me
that you believe that

1277
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,130
pile of bullshit?

1278
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,860
Is that supposed
to inspire confidence?

1279
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:55,600
Her mom has "borderline."

1280
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:58,100
Is that not a red fucking flag
to anybody else?

1281
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:59,230
That's a serious issue.

1282
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:00,700
Where the fuck did you get that?

1283
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:01,770
David's dad's rich!

1284
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:02,740
Rich people
have fucking guns, Sophie!

1285
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:04,540
My parents are rich.
They don't have guns.

1286
01:09:04,570 --> 01:09:06,040
Well, I mean, we're all rich,

1287
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:08,210
but you and David
are like rich, rich.

1288
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,180
That has never mattered to me...

1289
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:11,910
Oh, shut the fuck up!

1290
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:13,810
We didn't even
want to invite you.

1291
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,150
We debated about inviting you,

1292
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:16,880
but because it's David's house.

1293
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,190
I didn't say that, but...

1294
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,120
And, no, you did not
respond in the group chat.

1295
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:22,790
And then, you show up
with this fucking psychopath.

1296
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:24,960
Don't call her a psychopath,
that's so ableist.

1297
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:26,590
Fuck you.
You deserve each other.

1298
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:28,590
I hope she fucking suffocates
you in your sleep.

1299
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:31,600
Yeah, you didn't
reply in the chat.

1300
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:34,230
And David actually told me

1301
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:37,940
that you, like, begged him
to talk to your parents

1302
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:40,740
and, like,
unlock your trust again.

1303
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:42,150
And that's why
you're actually here.

1304
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:43,510
Oh, yeah?

1305
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:44,620
Oh, yeah, did he tell you that

1306
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,020
while you guys were railing
lines in front of me.

1307
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:46,880
Your addict friend

1308
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:49,020
who you're supposedly
so worried about?

1309
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:50,550
- We are worried.
- No!

1310
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:51,960
No, no, no.
Let me get this straight.

1311
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:53,100
Okay, let me get this straight.

1312
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,550
So, when the black girl

1313
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:56,120
has a coke habit,
it's a problem.

1314
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,830
But when everyone else
around her does it,

1315
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,890
including her best friend,
who happens to be white

1316
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:01,590
and male,

1317
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:02,860
it's fine?

1318
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:05,930
I understand and I'm an ally,

1319
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:09,940
and I totally get how it...

1320
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:12,870
Looks that way.

1321
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:15,010
And...

1322
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,180
Um...

1323
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:19,980
- Jordan?
- Oh, my god.

1324
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:22,550
You are obsessed
with playing the victim.

1325
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:23,480
Excuse me?

1326
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,150
I had to ride
in the ambulance with you

1327
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:27,190
three times,
thinking you were dead.

1328
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:29,060
I needed help and I got it

1329
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:30,220
- and I'm sorry.
- You got help?

1330
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:33,690
You mean we had to narc on you
to your fucking dad

1331
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,100
so he'd cut you off
and ship you off to rehab,

1332
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:39,570
while you were quite
literally kicking and screaming.

1333
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,830
- Yeah.
- And then you just

1334
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:42,300
fell off the face of the earth.

1335
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:43,450
'Cause that's what you do, soph.

1336
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:45,220
That's what you do
when things get tough, you run.

1337
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,640
You ran away to go write
your fucking memoirs.

1338
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:49,680
It's creative non-fiction
which is a valid response

1339
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:51,180
to life in an attention economy.

1340
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:52,850
Oh, fuck off and die.

1341
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:53,980
You write little essays

1342
01:10:54,010 --> 01:10:56,280
about your mommy and her vodka.

1343
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,780
And your pussy
and your feelings.

1344
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,050
And your fucking feelings.

1345
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:00,850
Oh, my god, we are all drowning

1346
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:02,260
in your fucking feelings.

1347
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:05,290
- Feelings are facts.
- No! No, they're not.

1348
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:06,590
Facts are facts.

1349
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:08,000
Why did you ghost us, Sophie?

1350
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:09,160
Like why?

1351
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,630
Because you fucking trigger me.

1352
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:14,840
You enable me.

1353
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:17,300
Does she know?

1354
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,740
Does she know what?

1355
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:21,770
That you begged me

1356
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:24,240
to stop at your apartment
on my way up here.

1357
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,610
And I did.

1358
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,880
And we fucked in your car.

1359
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:29,880
She's fucking lying.

1360
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,190
She's lying through
her fucking teeth.

1361
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,260
She's trying to get
in your head.

1362
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:33,990
Don't listen to her, okay?

1363
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:35,120
Check her texts.

1364
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:39,830
You are unhinged, Jordan.

1365
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,960
You are devoid of empathy.

1366
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,300
You have no feelings.

1367
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:47,100
Do you want to know
why I could never

1368
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:48,600
ever be with you?

1369
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:50,770
Because you schedule

1370
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,810
everything in your
fucking Google calendar,

1371
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,040
including sex.

1372
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:56,180
Because you have no soul.

1373
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:57,280
Fuck you.

1374
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:59,180
You're emotionally abusive.

1375
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:00,710
I had to go to therapy for PTSD.

1376
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:02,650
You can fucking ask Alice.

1377
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,380
Yeah, she did.

1378
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:06,390
For a long time.

1379
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:13,660
You hate Alice.

1380
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:15,330
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you despise her.

1381
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,840
You complain constantly
about how vapid

1382
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,230
and annoying she is.
You hate her.

1383
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:20,100
It's pitiful how
you won't stop making fun

1384
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:22,200
of her stupid little podcast.

1385
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:23,770
Let her have the podcast.

1386
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:26,670
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1387
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:29,940
You hate listen to her podcast.

1388
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:30,980
Wait...

1389
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,680
What?

1390
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:35,250
And you made us
swear on our lives

1391
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,380
not to tell anyone.

1392
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:38,320
Jordan, is that true?

1393
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,820
I like your podcast, Alice.

1394
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:44,720
What is your podcast about?

1395
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,760
Hanging out with your smartest
and funniest friend.

1396
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:50,260
Did you just groan?

1397
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:51,330
No.

1398
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:52,300
When I said "hanging out

1399
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:54,300
"with your smartest
and funniest friend."

1400
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:56,800
- Oh, my god.
- Like that. Like that!

1401
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,010
- Fuck!
- You just did it again.

1402
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,340
- No, I didn't!
- First of all,

1403
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:02,040
a podcast takes
a lot of work, okay?

1404
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,380
You have to organize the guests.

1405
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:05,180
You have to do a Google calendar

1406
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:07,410
and you build a following.

1407
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:09,180
It takes a long fucking time!

1408
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:11,020
And I've been working
on it for a while!

1409
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:13,050
Okay?

1410
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:15,060
And then, let me say,

1411
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:18,060
that nobody likes you, okay?

1412
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:21,360
Nobody likes you!
Nobody likes you!

1413
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,110
Do you know when you're drunk
and you cry to me,

1414
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:24,800
"oh, I'm afraid nobody likes me

1415
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:26,440
"because I'm mean
and a bitch and I suck."

1416
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:29,840
Well, you do, okay?
You fucking suck.

1417
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:32,010
And I only hang out
with you out of pity

1418
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,880
and the suffocating weight
of our shared history.

1419
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,140
And that is all.

1420
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:39,780
And you're just so in love

1421
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:41,950
with your rags
to riches narrative,

1422
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:43,880
like you're the only
fucking person in the world

1423
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,450
who didn't come from money.

1424
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:47,450
You know what?

1425
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:51,490
Your parents
are upper middle class.

1426
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:54,090
No, they're not.

1427
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:55,730
Jordan.

1428
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,300
They are.

1429
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:00,400
They teach at a university.

1430
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,800
It's public.

1431
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,940
Oh, my god.

1432
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:08,940
Oh, my god, I mean,
no wonder Sophie od'd.

1433
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:10,440
Who could date
a fucking spreadsheet

1434
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,880
with a superiority complex?

1435
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:13,390
It's, like, you're such a...

1436
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:16,280
Ow!

1437
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,950
What the fuck?

1438
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:20,290
What the fuck, Jordan?

1439
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:23,320
Oh, my god.
Are you serious?

1440
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,990
Did you just fucking shoot me?

1441
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:29,460
- No.
- You fucking shot me.

1442
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,230
With a gun!

1443
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:32,230
No,
I didn't shoot you. I...

1444
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:34,430
You fucking
murdered them, you freak!

1445
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,900
You're the murderer.
I knew it!

1446
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:38,470
I knew it, you're such a bitch!

1447
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:39,440
You're such a fucking bitch!

1448
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:41,440
- I didn't murder anybody.
- Yes, you did.

1449
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,040
Jordan, put the gun down.

1450
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,080
I've never
been shot before.

1451
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:48,150
It really fucking hurts!

1452
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:49,880
Put the fucking
gun down, please.

1453
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,890
You did this.
You made me do this.

1454
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,150
Why did you make me do that?

1455
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:54,260
What are you doing?
Put the gun down.

1456
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:56,420
Why? Why did you shoot me?

1457
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:57,420
I did not shoot you.

1458
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,330
- Yes, you did! With that gun!
- Stop, stop, stop.

1459
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,990
- Alice, stop. Stop!
- With that gun.

1460
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:02,960
- Stop waving it around.
- I'm not waving.

1461
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,330
Don't hit me.
You already shot me.

1462
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,170
Stop! Don't touch me.

1463
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,540
- No, no, no!
- Get the gun!

1464
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:09,370
- No!
- Sophie, the gun!

1465
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:10,940
- Don't! Stop!
- You're on my leg!

1466
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:12,110
You're on my leg!

1467
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:14,240
I want it. Give it to me!

1468
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:16,440
- No!
- Let go!

1469
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:22,050
No!

1470
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,420
Ow!

1471
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:24,920
No!

1472
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:25,850
- No!
- Give it to me.

1473
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:27,230
- Give me it! Give me it!
- Get off of me! No!

1474
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:28,360
Get the fuck off me!

1475
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:29,590
Get off!

1476
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:34,160
Ow! My fucking leg!

1477
01:15:34,190 --> 01:15:35,860
Where is it?

1478
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,460
Ow!

1479
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:20,140
I didn't do it.

1480
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:33,550
Please, don't move.

1481
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:34,960
Don't you fucking move.

1482
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,360
It's okay...
It's okay, Jordan.

1483
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:38,230
Please, don't do it.

1484
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,690
Please, just...

1485
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:43,230
- Stop! I didn't do it.
- Please, just stop, okay?

1486
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:45,030
- Just put it down.
- Please, stop moving.

1487
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:47,570
Please... please,
don't follow me, please.

1488
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,470
- Please...
- Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

1489
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,040
Stop, stop, stop!

1490
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,340
Why are we doing this?

1491
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:54,710
Don't come up here.

1492
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:55,980
Don't, please, don't.

1493
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:57,090
Please put it down.

1494
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:59,050
Please stop.
Please stay there.

1495
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:00,110
Oh, my god.

1496
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:01,350
Please...

1497
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:05,490
- Stop.
- I'm begging you...

1498
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,690
- Don't fucking come up here.
- Please.

1499
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:10,220
Sophie, I'm serious,
just stay there.

1500
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:12,460
Stop.

1501
01:17:12,490 --> 01:17:14,360
Just stay there.
Just please stay there.

1502
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:15,300
I'm begging you.

1503
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:19,430
Please, fucking...
Fucking stay there! Fuck!

1504
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,520
Bee!

1505
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:17,260
Check her texts.

1506
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,740
Sophie.

1507
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,250
Did you kill Emma?

1508
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:15,580
No.

1509
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,290
Did you?

1510
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:21,760
No.

1511
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:27,260
It's okay, if you did it.
It's okay.

1512
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:31,600
I just want to know.
You can tell me.

1513
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:34,100
- Did you kill David?
- What?

1514
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:35,400
No.

1515
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,100
You killed Greg.

1516
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:38,840
To protect you.

1517
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:40,370
I had to.

1518
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:00,730
Will you answer this honestly?

1519
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,100
Okay, I promise. What is it?

1520
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:05,770
Did you...

1521
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:07,600
With Jordan?

1522
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:09,500
No.

1523
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:11,170
No.

1524
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:15,510
No, I didn't...
I didn't. I would never.

1525
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:19,280
I love you, okay?

1526
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:27,320
Do you love me?

1527
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:37,430
I just wanted to touch you.

1528
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,530
You frighten me.

1529
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:48,840
Bee!

1530
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:54,510
Bee!

1531
01:20:56,650 --> 01:20:58,420
We have to stay together!

1532
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:01,190
Bee!

1533
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:07,290
Bee!

1534
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,440
Bee?

1535
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:19,910
Bee?

1536
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:23,480
Where are you?

1537
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:27,950
I love you.

1538
01:21:32,290 --> 01:21:33,690
We have to stay together.

1539
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:40,760
Bee!

1540
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,270
- Okay.
- Bee!

1541
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:53,530
Hey, hey.

1542
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:58,500
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1543
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:02,770
I have to tell you something.

1544
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:07,070
I went to Alice's room and I...

1545
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:09,810
And then I found coke
and then...

1546
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,550
I... I said all these things
to Emma and she...

1547
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:15,620
I... I gave her pills
'cause...

1548
01:24:16,650 --> 01:24:18,450
And then she tripped and fell.

1549
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:21,960
It's my fault.

1550
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,960
Sophie, it's okay. It's okay.

1551
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:30,030
I thought no one
would believe me.

1552
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:38,440
Give me your phone.

1553
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:41,670
What?

1554
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:43,810
I want to see
your text with Jordan.

1555
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:46,650
No.

1556
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:47,920
I have to see your texts.

1557
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:51,650
Please?

1558
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:19,810
- No.
- Sophie.

1559
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:21,080
Stop!

1560
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,190
That's not my phone.

1561
01:26:05,230 --> 01:26:06,730
Oh... what?

1562
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,630
That's not my phone.
