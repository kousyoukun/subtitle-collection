can I just point
all of our attention

654
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,723

hasn't said a fucking word.

the obvious. That's all.

Look, she's doing
that swallowing thing.

659
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:28,809
She always does that
when she's fucking nervous!

660

ALICE: (GASPS) Oh, my God!
Look, look!

661
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,370
Oh, my God, you're doing it.
You're swallowing it.

662

I'm not.
ALICE: You are.

663

but when you swallow,

664
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,509
it's just fucking...
Like, why?

665
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,743
Swallowing is normal.

666
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,887
It's a normal thing to do.
DAVID: Yeah...

667
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,822
It's very un-attractive.
I don't know why you do it?

668
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:45,316
Oh, my God. Is that why
you guys never have sex?

669
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,452
What?
Alice.

670
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:51,589
What? It's not a bad thing.
Some people have sex a lot.

671
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,557
Some people have it less.

672
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,460
Alice, what are you
talking about? We do.

673
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:57,395
I have it a lot. Some...

674
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:58,706
Are you fucking...
SOPHIE: Oh, my God.

675
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,610
Are you fucking talking
about us behind my back?

676
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,068
No.
Yes.

Excuse me?

685

the most over used words ever,

to, like, the point
of annihilation.

687

Okay, it doesn't mean
anything other than the fact

688
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,025
that, like,
you read the internet.

you have a Twitter account."

get over it.

692

gonna call me a narcissist?

like, the white supremacy?

in her fucking head

looking at me like that?

00:59:43,615 --> 00:59:44,616
Who are you?

1284
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,819
What?
You show up here,

1285
00:59:47,852 --> 00:59:49,854
start smiling at my boyfriend.

1286
00:59:51,723 --> 00:59:53,224
What are you talking about?

1287
00:59:53,258 --> 00:59:54,326
Your voice is trembling.

1288
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:56,261
No. No.
Yeah. It is.

1289
00:59:56,294 --> 00:59:57,429
JORDAN: I googled you.

1290
00:59:57,462 --> 00:59:59,130
And there was nobody
with your name

1291
00:59:59,164 --> 01:00:02,267
who graduated
from Utah State this year.

1292
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:05,170
There's literally no record
of your attendance, at all.

1293
01:00:05,203 --> 01:00:06,271
What the fuck?

1294
01:00:06,905 --> 01:00:08,673
Listen, I can explain.

1295
01:00:08,707 --> 01:00:10,175
ALICE: Oh, my God.

1296
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:11,710
You discovered David's body.

1297
01:00:11,743 --> 01:00:12,920
No, I just...
You could have tampered

1298
01:00:12,944 --> 01:00:13,845
with the generator,

1299
01:00:13,878 --> 01:00:15,356

with Sophie's car.

1300
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:16,314
You said you
left the lights on, right?

1301
01:00:16,348 --> 01:00:18,516
Are you serious?
We watched you kill someone.

1302
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:20,619
You literally murdered Greg!

1303
01:00:20,652 --> 01:00:21,886

1304
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,755

No... No.

about it, okay?

1309
01:00:31,396 --> 01:00:32,530
Mmm-mmm. I don't want to.

I don't...

I don't want you in here.

1315

BEE: Let go of me, Alice.

No, you killed
my fucking boyfriend.

1326

You know what? You know what?
It was self-defense.

All right.

Jesus, Alice.

1330

you to like me.

have fucking guns, Sophie!

want to invite you.

1441

respond in the group chat.

01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:22,994
And then, you show up
with this fucking psychopath.

1443
01:09:23,028 --> 01:09:25,164
Don't call her a psychopath,
that's so ableist.

1444
01:09:25,197 --> 01:09:26,797
Fuck you.
You deserve each other.

1445
01:09:26,831 --> 01:09:28,799
I hope she fucking suffocates
you in your sleep.

1446
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:31,802
ALICE: Yeah, you didn't
reply in the chat.

1447
01:09:31,836 --> 01:09:34,439
And David actually told me

1448
01:09:34,473 --> 01:09:38,143
that you, like, begged him
to talk to your parents

1449
01:09:38,177 --> 01:09:40,945
and, like,
unlock your trust again.

1450
01:09:40,978 --> 01:09:42,357
And that's why
you're actually here.

1451
01:09:42,381 --> 01:09:43,714
Oh, yeah?

1452
01:09:43,748 --> 01:09:44,825
Oh, yeah, did he tell you that

1453
01:09:44,849 --> 01:09:46,227
while you guys were railing
lines in front of me.

1454
01:09:46,251 --> 01:09:47,085
Your addict friend

1455
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:49,221
who you're supposedly
so worried about?

1456
01:09:49,254 --> 01:09:50,755
We are worried.
SOPHIE: No!

1457
01:09:50,788 --> 01:09:52,167
No, no, no.
Let me get this straight.

1458
01:09:52,191 --> 01:09:53,301
Okay, let me get this straight.

1459
01:09:53,325 --> 01:09:54,759
So, when the black girl

1460
01:09:54,792 --> 01:09:56,328
has a coke habit,
it's a problem.

1461
01:09:56,361 --> 01:09:58,030
But when everyone else
around her does it,

1462
01:09:58,063 --> 01:10:00,098
including her best friend,
who happens to be white

1463
01:10:00,532 --> 01:10:01,799
and male,

1464
01:10:01,832 --> 01:10:03,068
it's fine?

1465
01:10:03,101 --> 01:10:06,138
I understand and I'm an ally,

1466
01:10:06,171 --> 01:10:10,142
and I totally get how it...

1467
01:10:11,943 --> 01:10:13,078
looks that way.

1468
01:10:14,146 --> 01:10:15,214
And...

1469
01:10:16,281 --> 01:10:17,382
Um...

1470
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:20,185
Jordan?
Oh, my God.

1471
01:10:20,219 --> 01:10:22,753
You are obsessed
with playing the victim.

1472
01:10:22,787 --> 01:10:23,689
SOPHIE: Excuse me?

1473
01:10:23,721 --> 01:10:25,357
I had to ride
in the ambulance with you

1474
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:27,392
three times,
thinking you were dead.

1475
01:10:27,426 --> 01:10:29,261
I needed help and I got it

1476
01:10:29,294 --> 01:10:30,429
and I'm sorry.
You got help?

1477
01:10:30,462 --> 01:10:33,898
You mean we had to narc
on you to your fucking dad

1478
01:10:33,931 --> 01:10:36,301
so he'd cut you off
and ship you off to rehab,

1479
01:10:36,335 --> 01:10:39,770
while you were quite
literally kicking and screaming.

1480
01:10:39,804 --> 01:10:41,039
Yeah.
And then you just

1481
01:10:41,073 --> 01:10:42,507
fell off the face of the earth.

1482
01:10:42,541 --> 01:10:43,651
'Cause that's what you do, Soph.

1483
01:10:43,675 --> 01:10:45,420
That's what you do when
things get tough, you run.

1484
01:10:45,444 --> 01:10:47,845
You ran away to go write
your fucking memoirs.

1485
01:10:47,878 --> 01:10:49,880
It's creative non-fiction
which is a valid response

1486
01:10:49,914 --> 01:10:51,383
to life in an attention economy.

1487
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:53,051
Oh, fuck off and die.

1488
01:10:53,085 --> 01:10:54,186
You write little essays

1489
01:10:54,219 --> 01:10:56,488
about your mommy and her vodka.

1490
01:10:56,521 --> 01:10:57,989
And your pussy
and your feelings.

1491
01:10:58,023 --> 01:10:59,258
And your fucking feelings.

1492
01:10:59,291 --> 01:11:01,059
Oh, my God, we are all drowning

1493
01:11:01,093 --> 01:11:02,461
in your fucking feelings.

1494
01:11:02,494 --> 01:11:05,497
Feelings are facts.
No! No, they're not.

1495
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:06,797
Facts are facts.

1496
01:11:06,831 --> 01:11:08,200
Why did you ghost us, Sophie?

1497
01:11:08,233 --> 01:11:09,368
Like why?

1498
01:11:10,369 --> 01:11:11,836
Because you fucking trigger me.

1499
01:11:13,904 --> 01:11:15,040
You enable me.

1500
01:11:16,475 --> 01:11:17,509
Does she know?

1501
01:11:17,542 --> 01:11:18,943
SOPHIE: Does she know what?

1502
01:11:19,578 --> 01:11:21,979
That you begged me

1503
01:11:22,014 --> 01:11:24,449
to stop at your apartment
on my way up here.

1504
01:11:24,483 --> 01:11:25,816
And I did.

1505
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:28,086
And we fucked in your car.

1506
01:11:29,221 --> 01:11:30,088
She's fucking lying.

1507
01:11:30,122 --> 01:11:31,399
She's lying through
her fucking teeth.

1508
01:11:31,423 --> 01:11:32,467
She's trying to get
in your head.

1509
01:11:32,491 --> 01:11:34,192
Don't listen to her, okay?

1510
01:11:34,226 --> 01:11:35,327
Check her texts.

1511
01:11:37,995 --> 01:11:40,032
You are unhinged, Jordan.

1512
01:11:41,366 --> 01:11:44,169
You are devoid of empathy.

1513
01:11:44,202 --> 01:11:45,504
You have no feelings.

1514
01:11:45,537 --> 01:11:47,306
Do you want to know
why I could never

1515
01:11:47,339 --> 01:11:48,806
ever be with you?

1516
01:11:49,874 --> 01:11:50,975
Because you schedule

1517
01:11:51,009 --> 01:11:53,011
everything in your
fucking Google calendar,

1518
01:11:53,045 --> 01:11:54,246
including sex.

1519
01:11:54,279 --> 01:11:56,381
Because you have no soul.

1520
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,482
JORDAN: Fuck you.

1521
01:11:57,516 --> 01:11:59,384
You're emotionally abusive.

1522
01:11:59,418 --> 01:12:00,918
I had to go to therapy for PTSD.

1523
01:12:00,951 --> 01:12:02,853
You can fucking ask Alice.

1524
01:12:02,887 --> 01:12:04,589
Yeah, she did.

1525
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:06,591
For a long time.

1526
01:12:11,996 --> 01:12:13,864
You hate Alice.

1527
01:12:13,898 --> 01:12:15,534
No, I don't.
Yeah, you despise her.

1528
01:12:15,567 --> 01:12:17,045
You complain constantly
about how vapid

1529
01:12:17,069 --> 01:12:18,437
and annoying she is.
You hate her.

1530
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:20,305
It's pitiful how
you won't stop making fun

1531
01:12:20,339 --> 01:12:22,407
of her stupid little podcast.

1532
01:12:22,441 --> 01:12:23,974
Let her have the podcast.

1533
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:26,877
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1534
01:12:26,911 --> 01:12:30,148
You hate listen to her podcast.

1535
01:12:30,182 --> 01:12:31,183
Wait...

1536
01:12:31,583 --> 01:12:32,883
What?

1537
01:12:33,951 --> 01:12:35,454
And you made us
swear on our lives

1538
01:12:35,487 --> 01:12:36,588
not to tell anyone.

1539
01:12:37,356 --> 01:12:38,523
Jordan, is that true?

1540
01:12:39,924 --> 01:12:42,027
I like your podcast, Alice.

1541
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,929
What is your podcast about?

1542
01:12:44,962 --> 01:12:46,964
Hanging out with your
smartest and funniest friend.

1543
01:12:46,997 --> 01:12:50,469
(GROANS)
Did you just groan?

1544
01:12:50,502 --> 01:12:51,536
No.

1545
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:52,504
When I said "Hanging out

1546
01:12:52,537 --> 01:12:54,506
"with your smartest
and funniest friend."

1547
01:12:54,539 --> 01:12:57,008
(MOUTHS) Oh, my God.
Like that. Like that!

1548
01:12:57,042 --> 01:12:58,210
Fuck!
You just did it again.

1549
01:12:58,243 --> 01:12:59,544
No, I didn't!
First of all,

1550
01:12:59,578 --> 01:13:02,247
a podcast takes
a lot of work, okay?

1551
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,582
You have to organize the guests.

1552
01:13:03,615 --> 01:13:05,384
You have to do a Google calendar

1553
01:13:05,417 --> 01:13:07,619
and you build a following.

1554
01:13:07,652 --> 01:13:09,388
It takes a long fucking time!

1555
01:13:09,421 --> 01:13:11,223
And I've been working
on it for a while!

1556
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:13,258
Okay? (SOBS)

1557
01:13:13,291 --> 01:13:15,260
And then, let me say,

1558
01:13:15,293 --> 01:13:18,263
that nobody likes you, okay?

1559
01:13:18,296 --> 01:13:21,566
Nobody likes you!
Nobody likes you!

1560
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,311
Do you know when you're
drunk and you cry to me,

1561
01:13:23,335 --> 01:13:25,003
"Oh, I'm afraid nobody likes me

1562
01:13:25,036 --> 01:13:26,647
"because I'm mean
and a bitch and I suck."

1563
01:13:26,671 --> 01:13:30,041
Well, you do, okay?
You fucking suck.

1564
01:13:30,075 --> 01:13:32,210
And I only hang out
with you out of pity

1565
01:13:32,244 --> 01:13:35,080
and the suffocating weight
of our shared history.

1566
01:13:35,113 --> 01:13:37,349
And that is all.

1567
01:13:37,382 --> 01:13:39,984
And you're just so in love

1568
01:13:40,018 --> 01:13:42,154
with your rags
to riches narrative,

1569
01:13:42,187 --> 01:13:44,089
like you're the only
fucking person in the world

1570
01:13:44,122 --> 01:13:45,657
who didn't come from money.

1571
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:47,659
You know what?

1572
01:13:47,692 --> 01:13:51,696
Your parents
are upper middle class.

1573
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:54,299
No, they're not.

1574
01:13:54,699 --> 01:13:55,933
Jordan.

1575
01:13:56,668 --> 01:13:58,503
They are.

1576
01:13:58,537 --> 01:14:00,605
They teach at a university.

1577
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,009
It's public.

1578
01:14:04,042 --> 01:14:06,144
(CHUCKLING) Oh, my God.

1579
01:14:06,178 --> 01:14:09,147
Oh, my God, I mean,
no wonder Sophie OD'd.

1580
01:14:09,181 --> 01:14:10,649
Who could date
a fucking spreadsheet

1581
01:14:10,682 --> 01:14:12,083
with a superiority complex?

1582
01:14:12,117 --> 01:14:13,597
It's, like, you're such a...
(GUNSHOT)

1583
01:14:14,419 --> 01:14:16,488
Ow! (GROANS)

1584
01:14:17,422 --> 01:14:19,157
What the fuck?

1585
01:14:19,191 --> 01:14:20,492
SOPHIE: What the fuck, Jordan?

1586
01:14:20,525 --> 01:14:23,528
ALICE: Oh, my God.
Are you serious?

1587
01:14:23,562 --> 01:14:25,197
Did you just fucking shoot me?

1588
01:14:27,332 --> 01:14:29,668
No.
ALICE: You fucking shot me.

1589
01:14:29,701 --> 01:14:31,436
(WHIMPERS) With a gun!

1590
01:14:31,470 --> 01:14:32,437
JORDAN: No,
I didn't shoot you. I...

1591
01:14:32,471 --> 01:14:34,639
ALICE: You fucking
murdered them, you freak!

1592
01:14:34,673 --> 01:14:37,108
You're the murderer.
I knew it!

1593
01:14:37,142 --> 01:14:38,677
I knew it, you're such a bitch!

1594
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:39,644
You're such a fucking bitch!

1595
01:14:39,678 --> 01:14:41,646
I didn't murder anybody.
ALICE: Yes, you did.

1596
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,248
Jordan, put the gun down.

1597
01:14:43,281 --> 01:14:45,283
ALICE: I've never
been shot before.

1598
01:14:45,317 --> 01:14:48,353
It really fucking hurts!
(GROANS)

1599
01:14:48,386 --> 01:14:50,088
SOPHIE: Put the fucking
gun down, please.

1600
01:14:50,121 --> 01:14:52,090
You did this.
