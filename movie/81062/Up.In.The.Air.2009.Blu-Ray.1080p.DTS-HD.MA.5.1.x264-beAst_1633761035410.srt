1
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,780
这就是我为公司干了30年得到的?
This is what I get in return for 30 years of service for my company?

2
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,790
他们派个像你这样的混混
And they send some yo-yo like you in here,

3
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,300
来告诉我  我已经不适合工作了?
to try to tell me that I'm out of a job?

4
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,640
他们应该告诉你  你才不适合工作了才对
They should be telling you you're out of a job.

5
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,650
你居然有脸  来炒掉最能帮你赚钱的人
You have a lot of gall, coming in here and firing your No.1 producer.

6
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,520
然后明天就能带着大笔钞票回家了
And then you're going to go home tomorrow

7
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,020
然后明天就能带着大笔钞票回家了
and make more money than you've ever made in your life

8
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,380
而我却要身无分文的回去  我靠
and I'm going to go home without a pay cheque. Fuck you.

9
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,470
你....  让我目瞪口呆  不知道从何说起了
I just... I guess you leave me dumbfounded. I don't know where this is coming from.

10
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,860
做为一个男人  我该怎么向老婆解释  我被炒了?
How am I supposed to go back as a man and explain to my wife that I lost my job?

11
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:39,280
从心理压力上来说  我听说丢掉工作  就像死了家人一样
On a stress level, I've heard that losing your job is like a death in the family.

12
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,760
不过我个人觉得
But personally, I feel more like

13
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,190
更像我的同事们是家人  而我死了
the people I worked with were my family and I died.

14
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,750
我不能失去这份工作
I can't afford to be unemployed.

15
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,620
我要还房贷  还要养孩子
I have a house payment, I have children.

16
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,010
我不知道你过得怎么样
I don't know how you can live with yourself,

17
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,550
但是我肯定  在我们受折磨的时候  你能过得很好
but I'm sure that you'll find a way while the rest of us are suffering.

18
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,160
你他妈的是谁?
Who the fuck are you, man?

19
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,960
好问题  我他妈的是谁?
Excellent question. Who the fuck am I?

20
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,290
可怜的Steve在这儿工作七年了
Poor Steve has worked here for seven years.

21
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,590
我们从来没一起开过会  或者在走廊里遇见过
He's never had a meeting with me before or passed me in the hall,

22
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,810
或者在休息室里聊过天
or told me a story in the break room.

23
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,390
因为我其实不在这里上班
That's because I don't work here.

24
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,790
我所在的公司专门帮助那些  像Steve的老板一样的胆小鬼们
I work for another company that lends me out to pussies like Steve's boss

25
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,340
炒掉自己的员工
who don't have the balls to sack their own employees,

26
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:27,650
可以帮他们一劳永逸  人们被炒的时候  抓狂是理所当然的
in some cases for good reason. Because people do crazy shit when they get fired.

27
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,900
我做错什么了吗?
Did I do something wrong?

28
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,310
我是说  我做得比其它人差么?
I mean, is there something I could do differently here?

29
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,700
这不是针对你的  与你的工作能力无关
This is not an assessment of your productivity. Try not to take this personally.

30
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,730
不是针对个人的
Don't take it personally.

31
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,590
Steven  我想请你看下这份材料
Steven, I want you to review this packet.

32
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,500
请仔细看看  这里有你想知道的答案
Take it seriously. I think you're gonna find a lot of good answers in here.

33
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,920
我知道这肯定很有用  有一包呢
I'm sure this is gonna be very helpful. A packet.

34
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,590
谢谢...  你的一包材料
Thank you... A packet.

35
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,780
那些曾建立帝国  改变世界的伟人们
Well, anybody who ever built an empire or changed the world sat

36
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,630
也有过你这样的遭遇
where you are right now.

37
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,000
也正因为他们经历过  他们才能做到
And it's because they sat there they were able to do it.

38
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,240
真的
That's the truth.

39
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,410
请把你工牌给我
I'm gonna need your keycard.

40
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,750
好极了
Great. OK.

41
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,990
现在  我希望你好好利用今天  收拾下你的东西
Now, I want you to take the day, go get together your personal things, then tomorrow

42
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,230
明天锻炼锻炼  出去跑跑
you get yourself some exercise. You go out for a jog,

43
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,610
每天生活得规律点  很快你就能找回自信
you give yourself some routines and pretty soon you find your legs.

44
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,680
- 我怎么联系你?  - 别担心  我们会联系你的
- How do I get in touch with you?  - Don't worry, we'll be in touch soon.

45
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,360
这只是个开始
This is just the beginning.

46
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,560
我再也不会见到Steve了
I'll never see Steve again.

47
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,720
想了解我就要和我一起坐飞机  飞机就是我的家
To know me is to fly with me. This is where I live.

48
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,790
当我刷卡的时候
When I run my card,

49
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,710
系统会自动提醒前台小姐向我问好:
the system automatically prompts the desk clerk to greet me with this exact statement:

50
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,590
很高兴再次见到你  Bingham先生
Pleasure to see you again, Mr Bingham.

51
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:23,120
正是这些系统化的友好问候  使我的生活保持了规律
It's these kinds of systemised friendly touches that keep my world in orbit.

52
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,590
你可能会因为这些而讨厌旅行
All the things you probably hate about travelling

53
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,660
循环空气  人工照明  全自动果汁机
the recycled air, the artificial lighting, the digital juice dispensers,

54
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:09,480
廉价寿司...  正是它们提醒了我  这才是家
the cheap sushi... are warm reminders that I'm home.

55
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,260
你想要cancer(癌症)么?
Do you want the cancer?

56
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,890
- 什么?  - 你想要cancer(癌症)么?
- The what?  - Do you want the cancer?

57
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,890
癌症?
The cancer?

58
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,920
- 这瓶饮料...  先生?  - 哦  不用了  谢谢
- The can... sir?  - Oh, no. I'm fine, thank you.

59
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,140
汉普顿

60
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,720
下午5:30  远景阁  Ryan Bingham主讲  你的背包里都有什么?

61
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,260
你的生活有多重?
How much does your life weigh?

62
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,990
想象下你正背着一个包
Imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack.

63
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,510
我要你们想象一下  背带勒在肩膀上  感觉到了么?
I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders. Feel 'em?

64
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,280
现在我想让你们  把生活中所有的东西都塞到包里
Now I want you to pack it with all the stuff that you have in your life.

65
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,130
从小件开始
Start with the little things,

66
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,560
比如书架里抽屉里的小玩意收藏品
the things on shelves and in drawers the knick-knacks, the collectibles.

67
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,980
感觉背包不断变重
Feel the weight as that adds up.

68
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:29,370
然后开始收拾大件的...  衣服  桌上电器  台灯  毛巾...
Then you start adding larger stuff... clothes, table-top appliances, lamps, linens...

69
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,560
电视...
your TV...

70
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,280
背包现在已经相当重了  接着收拾更大的
The backpack should be getting pretty heavy now. And you go bigger.

71
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,540
沙发  床  餐桌  全都放进去
Your couch, bed, your kitchen table. Stuff it all in there.

72
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,680
车也放进去
Your car, get it in there.

73
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,170
你的房子  不管是间单人公寓  还是套两居室
Your home, whether it's a studio apartment or a two-bedroomed house.

74
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,380
我想让你们全都塞进背包里
I want you to stuff it all into that backpack.

75
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,970
现在试着走两步
Now try to walk.

76
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,770
很困难  是吧?
It's kind of hard, isn't it?

77
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,930
这就是我们每天做的事情
This is what we do to ourselves on a daily basis.

78
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,830
我们不断给自己增重  直到寸步难行  而且不能犯错...
We weigh ourselves down until we can't even move. And make no mistake...

79
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,790
移动就是生命
moving is living.

80
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,180
现在  我要把这背包烧了  你们想从里面拿出来什么?
Now, I'm gonna set that backpack on fire. What do you want to take out of it?

81
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,950
照片?
Photos?

82
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,710
照片是给没记性的人准备的  喝点银杏饮料  烧了照片吧
Photos are for people who can't remember. Drink some ginkgo and let the photos burn.

83
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,710
银杏饮料 - 防治高血压  心脏病

84
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:24,470
事实上  烧掉所有东西  想象着明天醒来什么都不必担负
In fact, let everything burn and imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing.

85
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,500
很令人兴奋  对吗?
It's kind of exhilarating, isn't it?

86
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,830
欢迎回来  Bingham先生
Welcome back, Mr Bingham.

Ryan Bingham工作室

You have me in a Dodge Stratus in Kansas City.

89
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,120
- 那里没有全尺寸轿车了  - 你试过...
- They were out of all full-size sedans.  - Did you try...

90
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,660
是的  我提醒过他们  你是一号黄金俱乐部的资深会员
Yes, I reminded them of your remarkable No.1 Gold Club status in years in the program.

91
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,810
他们正竭尽全力  要给你找辆铂锐(一种轿车)呢
They are literally moving mountains to see you in a Sebring.

92
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,210
- 可以了  还有其它消息么?  - 呃...  你妹妹Kara找你
- Fair enough. Any other messages?  - Er... your sister Kara called.

93
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,730
迫切想要和你谈谈她的婚礼
Needs to speak urgently about your sister's wedding.

I told her you were mid-air, and not even I knew your destination.

95
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,830
- 干得不错  - 你被邀请  去维加斯的GoalQuest上演说

GoalQuest  20?
GoalQuest 20?

97
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,810
我时不时的被邀请进行一些激励演说  不过GoalQuest?
Every once in a while, I do speaking engagements, motivational stuff. But GoalQuest?

98
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,310
那可是最大腕的演讲会啊
We're talking major Tony Robbins shit.

99
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,990
请帖上有个全息照防伪标志  叫做Dos Equis
It's got a hologram on it. They're calling it Dos Equis.

100
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,450

嘿  20分钟以后登机上天
Hey, 20 minutes from boarding into a world of bliss.

在菲尼克斯做的不错啊  伙计

105

你知道Big Auto月底又要裁1万人了吗?
You know that Big Auto is about to cut another 10K by the end of the month?

106
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,260
- 不会是真的吧  - 圣诞节快到了
- No kidding.  - Christmas came early.

107
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,580
我希望你能分身五处
I wish you could be in five places

108
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,360
不过这周我需要你待在奥马哈  没问题吧?
but I do need you here in Omaha this week. Alright?

109
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,610
我看你是想我分身无数个吧
I thought you needed me everywhere.

110
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,370
我们有个大计划  准备大换样了
We got something real big, a real game changer.

111
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,870
你在说什么呢?
What are we talking about here?

112
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:03,870
等着瞧吧  两个星期了  我终于拉了一泡屎  哈利路亚
You'll see. Today I took my first crap in two weeks. Hallelujah.

113
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,460
- 我要挂电话了  - 最爱听挂电话的声音了

对Maestro(美国汽车租赁公司)满意么?
Are you satisfied with Maestro?

116
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,080
是的
Yeah, I am.

117
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,430
它们的里程算得很严啊  我喜欢Hertz(美国汽车租赁巨头)
A little stingy with their miles. I like Hertz.

118
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,840
不  Hertz的车太旧了
No, Hertz keeps its vehicles too long.

119
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,640
我从不开超过20000英里的车
If a car has over 20,000 miles, I won't drive it.

120
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,630
Maestro不能即时结账  我喜欢即停即走
Maestro doesn't instant checkout. I like the park-and-go.

121
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,110
Hertz不提供导航
Hertz doesn't guarantee navigation.

122
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,290
你可不像需要导航的女士
You don't seem like a girl who needs directions.

123
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,000
我讨厌问路  所以我选择导航服务
I hate asking for directions. That's why I get a nav.

124
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,220
新公司  Colonial  还不错
That new outfit, Colonial, isn't bad.

125
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,230
- 你开玩笑的吧?  - 是的
- Is that a joke?  - Yes.

126
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,720
- 他们的车亭很烂  - 也从不提供升级服务
- Their kiosk placement blows.  - They never have available upgrades.

127
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,740
他们的车就像一队破盒子  我真不明白为什么它们还能营运
Basically, it's a fleet of shit boxes. I don't know how they're still in business.

128
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,110
- 我是Ryan  - 我叫Alex
- I'm Ryan.  - I'm Alex.

129
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:21,900
呃...  Maplewood酒店的卡  你怎么能把这种卡  带到这来?
Aww... Maplewood card. How dare you bring that into this palace?

130
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,030
希尔顿的价格一样  但食物更好
Hilton offers equal value and better food

131
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,900
不过Maplewood在入住的时候  会送贴心的甜点
but the Maplewood gives out warm cookies at check-in.

132
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,450
我被假装的好客迷住了
I'm a sucker for simulated hospitality.

133
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:35,810
其实这有个专业术语  是faux和homey结合起来的  叫faumey
There's an industry term for that. It's a mixture of faux and homey... faumey.

134
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:39,770
哦  天呐  我都不知道这卡确实有人有
Oh, my God. I wasn't sure this actually existed.

135
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,960
- 这是美国航空公司的...  - 对  这是贵宾卡
- This is the American Airlines...  - It's a Concierge Key, yeah.

136
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,670
- 这是拿碳纤维做的?  - 石墨的
- What is that, carbon fibre?  - Graphite.

137
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,140
- 哦  我喜欢这质感  - 拿到卡的时候我非常激动
- Oh, I love the weight.  - I was pretty excited the day that bad boy came in.

138
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:01,580
确实  我的里程数也积攒了不少了  每年6万  国内的
I'll say. I put up pretty pedestrian numbers. 60 thousand a year, domestic.

139
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,170
- 一般般吧  - 别忽悠我了
- That's not bad.  - Don't patronise me.

140
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,590
- 你积了多少了?  - 这是隐私
- What's your total?  - It's a personal question.

141
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,190
- 得了吧  - 而且我们还不熟
- Please.  - And we hardly know each other.

142
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:12,500
说出来听听  快  吓吓我
Show some hubris. Come on, impress me.

143
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,400
- 我猜肯定是个天文数字  - 你想象不到的
- I bet it's huge.  - You have no idea.

144
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,820
多大?
How big?

145
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,160
- 到底多大  这么大?  还是这么大?  - 我不想炫耀
- What is it, this big? This big?  - I don't want to brag.

146
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,220
噢  快啊!  说出来听听
Oh, come on! Come on.

147
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,190
我心里有个目标  现在还没达到
Let's just say I have a number in mind. I haven't hit it yet.

148
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,880
- 这卡真性感  - 希望它不会让我们的关系变低俗了
- This is pretty fucking sexy.  - Hope it doesn't cheapen our relationship.

149
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,720
我们俩也算是成功人士了
We're two people who get turned on by Elite Status.

150
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,440
我想低俗是我们的共同起点
I think cheap is our starting point.

151
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:44,160
忠诚可没有低俗的
There's nothing cheap about loyalty.

152
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:51,500
我们想出了这个计划  给我...
So, we came up with this master plan, which was for me...

153
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,060
两手缠满绷带和纱布
to put gauze, to put bandages on both my hands.

154
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:01,800
然后我们登机  横渡大西洋  飞到了  呃...  苏黎世
Then we got on the plane, transatlantic, flying to erm... Zurich.

155
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:06,540
我一直等到天黑  然后我和她去到洗手间
I waited till it was dark, and I walked up to the bathroom with her.

156
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,350
大家都在看电影  而我就像僵尸一样...
Everybody was watching the movie and I was like...

157
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,220
打开门进去  她帮我开的门
Opened up, went inside. She opened the door for me

158
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,880
然后做出要帮我的样子走进来
and came in like she was gonna help me.

159
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,990
我们觉得那样酷极了  不是很棒  不过很有趣  很狡猾
We gave it our best shot. It wasn't great. But it was fun. It was tricky.

160
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,110
- 再说说细节  - 不好形容的  你以前试过嘛?
- Give me some details.  - It's not so easy. Have you tried it?

161
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,190
- 不好说的  - 当然  我试过
- It's not so easy.  - Yes, I have.

162
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,980
- 真的?  - 当然
- Really?  - Really.

163
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,920
- 你成功了?  - 是的
- You've done that?  - I have done that.

164
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,620
- 在跨洋航班上?  - 国内航班...  其实是地方航班
- On a transatlantic flight?  - On a domestic flight... regional, actually.

165
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,780
- 晚上?  - 白天
- At night-time?  - Daytime.

166
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,920
- 怎么了?  - 你们怎么做的?
- What?  - How do you do that?

167
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,350
我很灵巧的
Oh, I'm really flexible.

168
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,960
瞧着  哦
Look. Ohh.

169
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,790
啊  我应该扔了它们
Ah, I should throw these out.

170
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,150
我们可以用那间有制冰机的
We can always use that room with the ice machine.

171
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,410
你瞧
Look.

172
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,210
在毛巾架上搞是个不错的选择
Good call on that towel rack.

173
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,640
我喜欢你在沙发上跟我翻云覆雨
I like how you burritoed me in the sofa cushions.

174
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,470
那是即兴的
I was improvising.

175
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,090
真遗憾我们没在壁橱里做
Shame we didn't make it to the closet.

176
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,770
- 那我们得再来一次  - 哦  对
- We got to do this again.  - Oh, yeah.

177
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,590
我第12周在纽瓦克  13周在莫德斯托...
I'm in Newark on the 12th, Modesto on the 13th...

178
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,830
第15周在俄克拉荷马...
Oklahoma City on the 15th...

179
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,420
哪天在西南区?  我第16周会到阿尔伯克基
Any Southwest? I'll be swinging by Albuquerque week of the 16th.

180
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,550
没有  第20周我会在佛罗里达  - 罗德岱堡  ?
No, I'm in Florida on the 20th.  - Fort Lauderdale?

181
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:01,430
- 迈阿密  40分钟车程呢  - 没什么区别
- Miami. 40 minutes.  - That's nothing.

182
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,250
我想我该回我房间了  这样就能在自己的床上醒来
I should probably go back to my room so I can wake up in my bed.

183
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,450
这才像淑女应该做的事情
I think that would be the ladylike thing to do.

184
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:29,240
- 很高兴遇见你  - 我也是
- Nice meeting you.  - A pleasure.

185
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,080
你好?
Hello?

186
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,750
嘿  Ryan  最近怎么样?
Hey, Ryan, how you holding up?

187
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,390
每个家庭都有一个成员经常保持联系
Every family has one person who keeps the genealogy in check.

188
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,180
我妹妹Kara就是...  像万能胶一样
That's my sister Kara... the glue.

189
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,860
我很好  你和孩子怎么样?
Fine. You and the kids?

190
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:18,650
小姑娘棒极了  Matthew进了校运动队  旅途顺利吗?
Missy's outstanding, Matthew made varsity. How's the road?

191
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,750
好极了
Couldn't be better.

192
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,830
很好  那么  Ryan?
Good. So, Ryan?

193
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,250
嗯?
Yeah?

194
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,240
其实我不想问你
I didn't even want to ask you this

195
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,360
我知道你对于帮别人忙的态度
because I know how you are about doing things for others.

196
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,860
可是3个星期后就是Juli的婚礼了
But we're coming up on three weeks to go to Julie's wedding

197
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,750
我们需要你的帮忙
and something we could really use your help on it.

198
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,960
什么?
Yeah?

199
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,760
我们寄给人们一些小东西
We've been sending people these kits,

200
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,510
这样就可以把Julie和Jim的相片打在纸板上
so they can print out photos of Julie and Jim on cardboard,

201
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,060
然后就可以在有趣的地方照相
and then take photos of them in interesting places

202
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,840
比如法国电影里的地精
kinda like that gnome in the French movie.

203
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,630
为什么?
Why?

204
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,340
因为这是Julie的婚礼  她觉得这很有趣  需要原因吗?
Because it's Julie's wedding and she thinks it would be fun. Does it matter why?

205
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,540
Julie怎么样了?
How is Julie?

206
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,640
你不能打个电话给她么  她觉得你像溜走了似的
Would you call her. She thinks you've turned to butter.

207
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,670
- 你简直就是孤僻透顶  - 孤僻?  完全不
- You're awfully isolated the way you live.  - Isolated? I'm surrounded.

208
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,100
你的助手说你要去维加斯
So your assistant said you were gonna be in Vegas.

209
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,250
他这么说过?
Did he?

210
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,180
你能在卢克索酒店前照张相么?
Can you get a photo of the cut-out in front of the Luxor pyramid?

211
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,940
那地方就像粪坑一样  没人会住那
The place is a shithole. Nobody stays there.

212
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:11,200
天呐  Ryan  我不是让你住在那里  你不能只拍一张照片么?
Jesus, Ryan, I'm not asking you to check in. Can you just take a stupid photo?

213
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,900
我会尽力的
I'll try my best.

214
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:16,610
谢谢你的努力
Thank you for trying your best.

215
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,610
奥马哈

216
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,850
去年  我有322天在旅途中
Last year, I spent 322 days on the road,

217
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,570
也就是说我要在家待痛苦的43天
which means I had to spend 43 miserable days at home.

218
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,910
嘿  邻居
Hey, neighbour.

219
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,860
嘿  你好
Hey, hi.

220
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,990
- 这个是你出差时候我签收的  - 哦  谢谢
- I signed for this while you were gone.  - Oh, thanks.

221
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,930
- 希望没有麻烦到你  - 没有
- I hope it wasn't too much of a bother.  - Nah.

222
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,980
这是我妹妹  我还没见过她未婚夫  他们要结婚了
It's my sister. I haven't met the guy yet. They're getting married.

223
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,190
- 不错啊  - 是吗?
- Lots of luck.  - I know, right?

224
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,820
你今晚有空吗?  一会过来聊聊?
What are you doing tonight? You wanna come over later?

225
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,120
呃...  我最近开始谈恋爱了
Um... I've started seeing somebody.

226
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,470
哦  好啊  太棒了
Oh. OK. Great.

227
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,410
嘿  见到你很高兴
Hey, it's good to see you.

228
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,240
- 我也是  - 这次好久没来见你了啊
- You too.  - It seems like it's been a while this time.

229
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,840
好的
Ok.

230
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,800
大家又聚到一起了  我很激动  兄弟们  欢迎回家
I'm thrilled that everyone's back under one roof. Welcome home, boy's.

231
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,850
关于为什么我们会在这里  有很多谣言  所以我开门见山吧
There's been a lot of whispering about why we're here, so let me jump right in.

232
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:17,450
零售业下降了20%
Retailers are down 20%.

233
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:22,100
汽车业也不景气  房地产已经完了
Auto industry is in the dump. Housing market doesn't have a heartbeat.

234
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:26,540
这是美国有史以来最糟糕的经济危机之一
It is one of the worst times on record for America.

235
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:30,090
这是我们的机遇
This is our moment.

236
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,400
去年夏天  我们这儿来了一位康奈尔大学毕业的女孩  活力四射
Now, last summer, we received a dynamite young woman here from Cornell.

237
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,310
她向我提出了一些很有创意的想法
And she had some pretty big ideas that she challenged me with.

238
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,720
我的第一反应是  "她以为她是谁?"
My first reaction was, "Who does this kid think she is?"

239
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,550
后来我仔细听了听  她确实震撼到我了  所以...
But after I gave it a listen, she really knocked me out. So...

240
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,450
有请我们未来的希望  Natalie Keener
With a peek into our future, Natalie Keener.

241
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:55,800
今天我想对大家说的  只有这一个词
If there's one word I want to leave you with today, it's this.

242
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,550
Glocal?
Glocal?

243
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,600
Glocal
Glocal.

244
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,920
我们的全球化必须本地化
Our global must become local.

245
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:11,560
我们公司有23个人  一年出差250天以上
This company keeps 23 people on the road at least 250 days a year.

246
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,610
这是昂贵且低效的
It's expensive and it's inefficient.

247
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,160
当我三个月前  带着此建议找Craig的时候
When I came to Craig three months ago with this,

248
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:22,150
他很狡猾的回答我  只有你能解决它的时候  这才是个问题
he told me, and quite astutely, it's only a problem if you have a solution.

249
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,860
现在  我带着解决方法站在你们面前
Well, today I stand before you with just that.

250
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,300
你们都认识接待处的Ned  今天我要来炒掉他
You all know Ned in reception. Today I'm gonna fire Ned.

251
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,970
抱歉  Ned  我肯定今天下午  人事部会重新雇请你
Sorry, Ned. I'm sure HR will hire you back this afternoon.

252
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,370
这可未必
We'll see about that.

253
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,080
Ned可以是我们任何地方的客户  想要解雇的任何一人
Ned could be any employee in any one of our clients' locations worldwide.

254
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,160
策略规划会提前送达
Strategy packets will be shipped in advance.

255
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,660
Ned一坐下就会看到  我们一个过渡专家正在等他
Ned will be given a seat and find one of our transition specialists waiting.

256
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,460
Laskin先生
Mr Laskin,

257
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,300
今天我们进行对话  是因为你的职位已经不再需要了
we're having this conversation as your position is no longer available.

258
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,550
我不明白  我被炒了?
I don't understand. I'm fired?

259
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,840
听到"你已经被赶走了"这句话确实不好受
Hearing the words"You've been let go" is never easy.

260
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:01,580
改变让人恐惧  但是要考虑一下:
Change is scary, but consider the following:

261
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:05,290
那些曾建立帝国  改变世界的伟人们  也有过你这样的遭遇
anybody who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you are now.

262
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:08,780
也正因为他们经历过  他们才能做到
And it's because they sat there that they were able to do it.

263
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,060
那他妈是我的台词
That's my fucking line.

264
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,070
但现在是怎么回事?
But what happens now?

265
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,830
你要做的第一步就是  找到适合你的新工作
This is the first step of a process that ends with you in a new job that fulfils you.

266
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,380
是  但怎样才能做到?
Yeah, but how does it work?

267
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,460
打开你面前的文件包
Way to take the packet in front of you.

268
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,740
仔细看看...  你要的答案都在里面
Review it... all the answers you're looking for are inside.

269
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,770
填上必要的信息
Start to fill out the necessary information and before you know it

270
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,150
你就踏上寻找新机遇的路了
you're on the way to new opportunities.

271
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,340
Ned  回到你的办公桌  开始收拾你的东西
Ned, go back to your desk and start putting together your things.

272
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,340
就当是帮我  我希望你现在别把这事传出去
As a favour to me, I'd appreciate it if you didn't spread the news just yet.

273
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,210
恐慌帮不了任何人
Panic doesn't help anyone.

274
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,850
我明白
I understand.

275
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,430
为Ned鼓掌
Give it up for Ned.

276
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,950
你可以一早从波士顿开始  午后去达拉斯
You can start the morning in Boston, stop in Dallas over lunch,

277
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:54,160
在旧金山结束一天的工作  只需要支付T1网络的费用
and finish the day in San Francisco. All for the price of a T1 line.

278
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,530
我们的出差预算减少了85%
Our inflated travel budget is eviscerated by 85%.

279
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,320
更重要的是  对奔波在外的你们来说
And more importantly, to you guys on the road,

280
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:05,960
再也不用在塔尔萨的宾馆里过圣诞  再也不会因为天气耽误时间
no more Christmases in a hotel in Tulsa, no more hours lost to weather delays.

281
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,230
你们可以回家了
You get to come home.

282
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,610
告诉我你不是动真格的
Tell me you're not taking this seriously.

283
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,830
我把全公司的人从路上拉回公司
That's why I brought the entire company in from the road,

284
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,450
就是因为要动真格的
because we're taking it seriously.

285
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,700
我做的工作有一套方法论  有它行之有效的原因
There is a methodology to what I do, there is a reason why it works.

286
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,480
可口可乐和IBM这么做很多年了  好吗?  对它们不陌生吧?
Coke and IBM have been doing this for years, alright? You're familiar with them?

287
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,190
新东西都这样  需要几个月的过渡期
Like anything else, it'll take a few months of transition

288
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,360
大家都会适应的
and everybody will settle in.

289
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,800
- 你要把谁从路上拉回来?  - 你怎么还不明白?
- Who are you taking off the road?  - How are you not getting this?

290
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:35,170
你不用到处跑了  所有人都不用到处跑了  就这么定了
You are grouned. Everybody's grounded. It's done.

291
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,790
我们这样做太残酷了  会让离职的人们身心交瘁
What we do here is brutal and it does leave people devastated.

292
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,350
而我的方式却能给他们尊重
But there is a dignity to the way I do it.

293
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,560
不从背部  改从他们胸部捅一刀  是吗?
By stabbing them in the chest instead of the back, right?

294
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,990
- 你要见我?  - 呃...
- You wanted to see me?  - Well, uhm...

295
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:50,410
- 你知道吗?  对  进来  进来  - 干得漂亮
- You know what? Yeah, come on in. Come on in.  - Great job.

296
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,820
- 谢谢  大家怎么看?  - 非常好
- Thank you. How's everyone taking it?  - Great.

297
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:59,620
听着  我很欣赏你的...  热情  我认为你有些很不错的想法
Listen, I admire your... your zeal. And I think you have some very good ideas.

298
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,010
但你对我们行业的现实一无所知
But you know nothing about the realities of my industry.

299
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:06,800
你可以建立聊天界面  但你不知道人们是怎么想的
You can set up an iChat, but you don't know how people think.

300
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,440
- 我辅修了心理学  - 很好
- Actually I minored in psychology.  - Nice.

301
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,530
- 好吧  孩子  解雇我  - Ryan...
- OK, kiddo, fire me.  - Ryan...

302
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,630
如果她要经常这么做  你难道不想知道她到底能不能胜任?
If she's gonna do this regularly, don't you wanna know if she can fire somebody?

303
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,260
- 她已经解雇了Ned  - 我的狗都能解雇Ned  解雇我
- She's fired Ned.  - My dog can fire Ned. Fire me.

304
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,170
- 你不必这么做  - 不  没关系  我做
- You don't need to do this.  - No, it's OK. I got this.

305
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,660
Bingham先生
Mr Bingham,

306
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:30,980
很遗憾通知你  你的职位已经不需要人手了
I regret to inform you that your position at this company is no longer available.

307
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,080
哼  你他妈是谁?
Hm. Who the hell are you?

308
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,750
我是Keener  我今天来这儿是要讨论你的将来
My name is Miss Keener. I'm here today to discuss your future.

309
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,330
我的将来?  唯一能解雇我的是Craig Gregory
My future? The only one who can fire me is Craig Gregory.

310
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,270
- Craig Gregory雇我来处理这些事  - 处理什么?  解雇我?
- Mr Craig Gregory hired me to handle this for him.  - Handle what? Handle me?

311
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,130
Gregory先生雇用了我  他是唯一能解雇我的人
Mr. Gregory hired me, he's the only one who can fire me.

312
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,630
- 知道吗?  我要和他谈  - Bingham先生...
- You know what? I'm gonna go talk to him.  - Mr Bingham...

313
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,400
不  不  你不能跟着我  你只是在电脑屏幕上  记得吧?
No, no. You can't follow me. You're on a computer screen, remember?

314
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,770
- Ryan...  - 咱们再试试  再来解雇我
- Ryan...  - Let's try this again. Fire me again.

315
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,030
- 我已经解雇你了  - 事实上  你没做到  解雇我
- I just did.  - Actually, you didn't. Fire me.

316
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,720
够了  我们明白了
That's enough. I think we get it.

317
00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:00,150
- 是吗?  - Bingham先生  我来是通知你  你的职位已经不需要人手了
- Yeah?  - Mr Bingham, I'm here to inform you your position is no longer available.

318
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,420
- 我被炒鱿鱼了?  - 是的  你被炒鱿鱼了
- I'm fired?  - Yes, you're fired.

319
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,530
- 永远别说炒鱿鱼  - 你可以走了
- Never say fired.  - You've been let go.

320
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,030
为什么?
Why?

321
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,490
这是个虚拟场景  我怎么可能知道为什么?
This is a mythical situation. How could I possibly know why?

322
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,810
为什么不重要  你永远不会知道为什么
Why doesn't matter, you never know why.

323
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:14,660
别老想着为什么  不如  把精力花在规划未来上
Don't focus on the why. Rather, spend your energy thinking about your future.

324
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,370
呃  我要花精力起诉你
Well, I'm gonna spend my energy on suing you

325
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,130
除非你给我一个解雇我的合理解释
unless you give me a good reason why you're firing me.

326
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,850
Bingham先生  原因并不重要
Mr. Bingham, the reason's not important.

327
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,670
你毫无缘由的解雇我?  现在我真要起诉了
You're firing me without grounds? Now I really have a lawsuit.

328
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,910
- 我知道你想说什么了  Ryan  - 这不是针对你个人的  Bingham先生
- I get what you're trying to say, Ryan.  - Don't take this personally, Mr. Bingham.

329
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,350
个人?
Personally?

330
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,250
这是你将要遇到的最个人的状况
This is the most personal situation you are ever gonna enter,

331
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,990
所以在你想改革我的工作之前
so before you try to revolutionise my business,

332
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,430
我要知道  你确实了解我的工作
I'd like to know that you actually know my business.

333
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:50,580
这样欢迎她进组真糟糕
That's a hell of a way to welcome her to the team.

334
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,870
难道就我一人眼睁睁看着  这样做让我们把自己变得不相干了?
Am I the only one that sees that by doing this we're making ourselves irrelevant?

335
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,450
不  老实说  我们把你变得不相干了
No, frankly, we're making you irrelevant.

336
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,330
- 真好  - 别怪我
- Nice.  - Don't blame me.

337
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,740
要怪就怪贵死的燃料  怪保险费  怪新科技
Blame high fuel costs, blame insurance premiums, blame technology.

338
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,260
你要注意  要变成老古董  你还太年轻
You're gonna watch yourself. You're a little too young to become a dinosaur.

339
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,960
- 我不是老古董  - 我想让你教教她
- I'm not a dinosaur.  - I want you to show her the ropes.

340
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,260
我哪知道要怎么做?  让Ferguson去做吧
What do I know what goes on here? Get Ferguson to do it.

341
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,830
我不是在这讨论
I'm not talking about here.

342
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,390
- 不  - 是的
- No.  - Yeah.

343
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,310
你坚信那女孩不知道她自己在做什么  所以...
You're very confident this girl doesn't know what she's doing. So...

344
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:26,140
很抱歉  我不觉得一个聚友的网页就能让你把整个公司联系起来
I'm sorry. I don't think a MySpace page qualifies you to rewire a company.

345
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,240
那好  你的机会来了
That's been great. Here's your chance.

346
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,030
出去  给她露两手  教教她做这行
Go out, show her the magic, take her through the paces.

347
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,900
我又不是他妈的导游
I'm not a fucking tour guide.

348
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:39,130
- 你又来了  - Bingham  这是船
- Now here we go.  - Bingham, here's the boat,

349
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,260
这是你  你想上船吗?
and here's you. Do you want to be in the boat?

350
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,740
想  独自一人
Yeah, alone.

351
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,650
我们要开始革新了  要把大家都聚起来
We're ringing the bell, we're rounding everybody up.

352
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,460
你想在外面待久一点  没问题  但你不能一个人  好吗?
You want to stay out a bit longer, you're welcome, but you will not be alone. Ok?

353
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,570
想清楚  再跟我说
You let me know.

354
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,380
噢  上帝
Oh, Christ.

355
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,220
- 怎么了?  - 跟我来
- What?  - Follow me.

356
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,550
- 我很喜欢我的行李箱  - 对极了  这就是...  行李箱
- I really like my luggage.  - That's exactly what it is... luggage.

357
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,530
知道这样登机要浪费多长时间吗?
Know how much time you lose checking in?

358
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,830
- 不知道  五...  十分钟?  - 一个航班耽误35分钟
- I don't know. Five... ten minutes?  - 35 minutes a flight.

359
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:22,950
我一年出差270天  那就有157个小时
I travel 270 days a year. That's 157 hours.

360
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:28,450
相当于七天  你想把一整个星期浪费在这上面?
That makes seven days. Are you willing to throw away an entire week on that?

361
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:39,410
你不需要这个  抱歉  你不需要那个
You don't need this. Sorry, you don't need that.

362
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,490
你不需要那个  飞机上有枕头
You don't need that. They have neck pillows on the plane.

363
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:47,780
这个...  他们那的更好  我要把这个扔了
This... they have better ones there. I'll get rid of this.

364
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,750
我们可以在安检那儿见
I can just meet you at security.

365
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,080
谢谢
Thank you.

366
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,980
好的  亚洲人
Bingo. Asians.

367
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,790
- 你不是认真的吧  - 永远别排在带小孩的大人后面
- You can't be serious.  - Never get behind people with infants.

368
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,550
我从没见过有哪个推婴儿车的  能在20分钟内搞定
I've never seen a stroller collapse in less than 20 minutes.

369
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:08,710
老人更糟  他们身上到处藏着金属制品
Old people are worse. Their bodies are littered with hidden metal

370
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,740
时日无多  他们却从不珍惜
and they never appreciate how little time they have left on earth.

371
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:16,700
看他们  五字真言:  特检几率小
Here we go. Five words: randomly selected for additional screening.

372
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,190
亚洲人  他们行李轻便  有效率
Asians, they pack light, travel efficiently,

373
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:22,740
而且他们穿容易脱的鞋  少花时间
and they've got a thing for slip-on shoes. Got a little.

374
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:26,910
- 这是种族歧视  - 我像我妈  看人有偏见  但我更快
- That's racist.  - I'm like my mother, I stereotype. It's faster.

375
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,160
你背包里有什么?  Ryan  Bigham

376
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,200
你跟你的电脑有仇吗?
Are you mad at your computer?

377
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:01,000
我正在做东西
I type with purpose.

378
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,440
你这么猛烈地在做什么?
What is it that you're working on so furiously?

379
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,970
我在建立解雇技术的工作流程
I'm building a workflow of firing techniques.

380
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:11,890
就是问题与应答  行为与反应
It's questions and responses, actions and reactions.

381
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,520
这个脚本给你提供裁员步骤
A script taking you through the steps of firing someone.

382
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,170
为谁设计的?
Who's it for?

383
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,410
呃  理论上讲
Well, theoretically,

384
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,650
放之四海而皆准  可用于迅速裁员
you could put it in the hands of anyone and they'd be downsizing immediately.

385
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,330
你只要按步骤来就行了
All you have to do is follow the steps.

386
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:27,900
Natalie  你觉得我们是干什么的?
Natalie, what is it you think we do here?

387
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:31,300
我们为刚被解雇的员工  处理再次求职遇到的身体及心理问题
We prepare the newly-unemployed for the emotional and physical hurdles of job hunting,

388
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,970
同时尽可能减少法律诉讼
while minimising legal blowback.

389
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,690
那是我们对外说的  并非我们所做的
That's what we're selling. It's not what we're doing.

390
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:40,300
- 好吧  那我们是干什么的?  - 我们让地狱不那么可怕
- OK, what are we doing?  - We are here to make limbo tolerable,

391
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:44,800
我们用渡船帮助受伤的魂灵渡过恐惧之河
to ferry wounded souls across the river of dread

392
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:48,880
直到希望之光隐约可见
until the point where hope is dimly visible.

393
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,510
然后停下船  推他们下水  让他们游泳
Then stop the boat, shove 'em in the water and make 'em swim.

394
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,810
真精彩  你要把它写到书里吗?
That's really impressive. Are you gonna put that in your book?

395
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,440
圣路易斯

396
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,360
- 我要接下电话  在汽车出租公司见  - 好的
- I gotta grab this. I'll meet you at the car rental.  - Okay.

397
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,180
嘿  我一直等你的消息
Hey, I was hoping I'd hear from you.

398
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:18,340
我在特兰大  给我推荐家肋排餐馆吧
I'm in Hotlanta and I need a rib-joint recommend bad.

399
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,900
肥麦特餐馆  带上围嘴
Fat Matt's. Bring a bib.

400
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,730
- 你一直没打电话  - 我不知道那样是否合适
- You never called.  - I wasn't sure what was appropriate.

401
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,670
合适?  我不是你在大雪天搞上的女服务员
Appropriate? Right, I'm not some waitress you banged in a snowstorm.

402
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:32,150
我们的字典里没有这个词
That word has no place in our vocabulary.

403
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,920
我是个不需要你担心的女人
I'm the woman that you don't have to worry about.

404
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,810
- 听起来是个陷阱  - 听着...
- Sounds like a trap.  - Listen...

405
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,600
以后别再担心礼仪什么的  不需要
the next time that you're worried about manners, don't.

406
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:48,210
你想打电话  就打  把我当成你自己  就是多了个阴道
If you wanna call, call. Just think of me as yourself, only with a vagina.

407
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,670
我要在哪见你?
When am I gonna see you?

408
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:56,990
呃  我要离开Hartsfield去IAD机场  然后从ORD转到SDF机场
Well, I'm out of Hartsfield into IAD, with a connection in ORD into SDF.

409
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,470
真遗憾
Sorry.

410
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,520
对  你说的是
Yeah, tell me about it.

411
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,670
你中间停留多久?    到SDF的航班很多  你能推迟点吗?
How long's your layover? They got multiples into SDF. Could you push?

413

你今天要做的就是看和听
All you have to do today is watch and listen.

414
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:29,130
当我说到策略文件包时  你就给他们一份
And when I talk about a strategy packet, hand them one of those.

415
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,490
听起来不错
Sounds great.

416
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,880
虽然我希望我能带来好消息
So although I wish I were here with better news,

417
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,930
但你和我坐在这儿是因为
the fact is that you and I are sitting here today because

418
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,500
这将是你在公司的最后一周了
this will be your last week of employment at this company.

419
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,550
- 为什么是我?  - 我现在该怎么办?
- Why me?  - What am I supposed to do now?

420
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,850
我是不是该庆幸我不是唯一被炒鱿鱼的?
Am I supposed to feel better I'm not the only one losing my job?

421
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:51,090
太荒谬了!  我在这兢兢业业十年多
This is ridiculous! I have been a fine employee for over 10 years

422
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,790
你们就这么对我
and this is the way you treat me.

423
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:57,090
你夜里怎么睡得着  伙计?  怎么睡得着?
How do you sleep at night, man? How?

424
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,860
你家人呢?  他们夜里睡得好吗?
How's your family? They sleeping well at night?

425
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,030
电照样通?
Electricity still on?

426
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,750
暖气照样通  冰箱照样装满食物?
Heat still on, refrigerator full of food?

427
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,160
煤气罐照样装满煤气?

周末还能去查克起司(餐厅名)什么的?
Going to Chuck E. Cheese this weekend or something?

429
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,560
我就不行了
Not me.

430
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,060
不  我的孩子  我们什么也做不了
No, my kids, we're not gonna do anything.

431
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,970
你要我怎么跟他们说?
What do you suggest I tell them?

432
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,540
也许你低估了你职业转变
Perhaps you're underestimating the positive effect

433
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,580
对你孩子的有利影响
your career transition can have on your children.

434
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:35,700
有利影响?
The positive effect?

435
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,990
我现在一年赚大概9万美元
I make about 90 grand a year now.

436
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,300
失业以后呢...  一星期250美元?
Unemployment is what... 250 bucks a week?

437
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,700
这就是你所谓的有利影响之一?
Is that one of your positive effects?

438
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,380
我们会过得很难  因为我付不起房贷了
We'll get to be cosier cos I'm not gonna be able to pay my mortgage on my house.

439
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:53,180
所以我们可能要搬到某个漂亮的  该死的一居室公寓里了
So maybe we can move into a nice fucking one-bedroom apartment somewhere.

440
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,530
另外  我猜没了工作
And I guess without benefits,

441
00:33:55,610 --> 00:34:00,530
她哮喘发作时  我就只能看着我的女儿
I'll be able to hold my daughter as she, you know, suffers from her asthma

442
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,670
因为我付不起医疗费了
that I won't be able to afford the medication for.

443
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,590
呃...  测试显示受中等创伤的孩子
Well... tests have shown that children under moderate trauma have a tendency to

444
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:11,500
在学术上会更努力...
apply themselves academically...

445
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,520
这是他们处理的方式
as a method of coping.

446
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,640
去你妈的
Go fuck yourself.

447
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,240
那才是我孩子的想法
That's what my kids'll think.

448
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:24,600
- 孩子的崇拜对你很重要?  - 是的
- Your children's admiration is important to you?  - Yeah.

449
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,350
是的  确实是
Yeah, it was.

450
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,650
呃  我怀疑他们是否崇拜过你  Bob
Well, I doubt they ever admired you, Bob.

451
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:33,660
嘿  混蛋  你不是该安慰我吗?
Hey, asshole, aren't you supposed to be consoling me?

452
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,640
我不是心理医生  Bob  我只是个叫醒电话
I'm not a shrink, Bob. I'm a wake-up call.

453
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,500
- 你知道孩子为什么喜欢运动员吗?  - 因为他们搞上了内衣模特?
- You know why kids love athletes?  - Cos they screw lingerie models?

454
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,760
不  那是我们喜欢运动员的原因  孩子们喜欢
No, that's why we love athletes. Kids love athletes

455
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,310
因为他们追逐梦想
because they follow their dreams.

456
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:52,410
- 呃  我不会灌篮  - 对  但你会做饭
- Well, I can't dunk.  - No, but you can cook.

457
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,120
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

458
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,690

but you bussed tables at Il Picador to support yourself.

461
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:08,810
然后你大学毕业  来到这工作
Then you get out of college and then you come and work here.

462
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,450
他们当时给你多少薪水  就让你放弃了梦想?
How much did they first pay you to give up on your dreams?

463
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,090
- 一年两万七千美元  - 那你什么时候才会停下来
- 27 grand a year.  - And when were you going to stop

464
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,780
回过头做让你自己开心的事?
and come back and do what makes you happy?

465
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,500
好问题

他们上班  下班  从未有过片刻的喜悦
They clock in, they clock out, and they never have a moment of happiness.

469
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,250
你现在有个机会  Bob
You have an opportunity here, Bob.

470
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,660
这是一次重生
This is a rebirth.

471
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:44,860
就算不为了你自己  也是为了你的孩子
If not for you, do it for your children.

472
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,600

并不是那样  目标就是英里数
It's not like that. The miles are the goal.

484
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,090
就这样?
That's it?

485
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,610
你攒英里数就是为了攒英里数?
You're saving just to save?

486
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:05,470
我只是说我脑中有一个数字  我还没达到而已
Just say I have a number in mind and I haven't hit it yet.

491
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,920
呃  我们都得有点嗜好
Well, we all need a hobby.

492
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:28,510
不  我...  我不是有意贬低你的爱好  我明白了  那很酷
No, I... I don't mean to belittle your collection. I get it. It sounds cool.

493
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,060
我会是第7个做到的人  上过月球的人都比这多
I'd be the seventh person to do it. More people have walked on the moon.

494
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:36,560
- 他们给你来了个游行庆祝?  - 你有终生的行政地位
- Do they throw you a parade?  - You get lifetime executive status,

495
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,010
你能见到机长  Maynard Finch...
you get to meet the chief pilot, Maynard Finch...

496
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,610
而且  他们把你的名字写在飞机上
And they put your name on a plane.

497
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,630
男人总是渴望自己名字出现在某些东西上  你们都还没长大
Men get hard-ons putting their name on stuff. You guys don't grow up.

498
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,450
- 就像你们随处小便一样  - 现在是谁有偏见啊?
- It's like you need to pee on everything.  - Now who's stereotyping?

499
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:50,690
是对死亡的恐惧  就像是  你某天会死去
Fear of mortality. It's like, yeah, you're gonna die one day.

500
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,060
你为什么觉得只有男人会这么想?
Why do you suppose that's singular to men?

501
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:57,460
- 很可能因为你们不能生孩子  - 孩子理论
- Probably because you can't have babies.  - The baby argument.

502
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,360
如果我有那么多英里数...
If I had that many miles...

503
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,890
我就在机场炫耀
I would show up at an airport,

504
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:09,390
看着指路牌  选个地方  然后就去
look at the destination board, pick a place and go.

505
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,180
睡不着

506
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,550
我也正躺着呢

507
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,810
你该找个人出去

508
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:47,200
多谢你的建议
Thanks for the advice.

509
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,440
你也那么做才公平

510
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:04,060
早就做了

511
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,920
下回一定要给我打电话  那样我可以听听

512
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,120
那就做个里面有我的春梦吧

513
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:32,990
好的  向前  再向前点
OK. Closer. Way closer.

514
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,030
再往前
Still closer.

515
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,050
往前
Closer.

516
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,640
呃...  稍向左
Er... a little left.

517
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,830
往下点
Down a little.

518
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,730
下去太多了  往上  再往上一英寸
Too far. Up. Up one more inch.

519
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,100
我不明白  为什么你妹妹会想要张假照片?
I don't get it. Why does your sister want a fake photo?

520
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:55,380
我妹妹很奇怪的  她觉得这很有趣  就像地精一样
My sister is kooky. She thinks this is charming. It's like the Gnome Thing.

521
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,690
不  我想问的是  她为什么会想要一张在圣路易机场的照片?
No, I mean, why would she want a fake photo in front of St Louis airport?

522
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,320
你在开玩笑吗...  这可是Lambert机场呀  怀特兄弟飞越过这里
Are you kidding... Lambert Field? The Wright brothers flew through there.

523
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,560
主航站楼的那个屋顶
That domed main terminal,

524
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:08,770
是圆屋顶的首创  肯尼迪和戴高乐机场  都是按照它的设计理念设计的
is the first of its kind, a precursor of everything from JFK to de Gaulle.

525
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:12,440
- 真厉害  - 照你的相
- Pretty sweet.  - Just take the picture.

526
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:17,160
好了  照下来了
Well, that's a keeper.

527
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,370
让我看看
Let me see it.

528
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,220
我也不知道她为什么  要在这些她从没去过的地方留念  但是...
Why she wants reminders of all the places she hasn't been is beyond me. But...

529
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,540
我相信她没能来这儿一定很痛苦
I'm sure she'll be crushed for having missed this airport.

530
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:30,890
在Lindbergh飞越大西洋之前  他曾经从这里的某条跑道上起飞
Look, before Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic, he took off from one of those runways.

531
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,900
你从没好奇过  为什么人们称之为圣路易精神么?
Do you ever wonder why they called it the Spirit of St Louis?

532
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,870
- 没有  - 好吧...
- No.  - Well...

533
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,960
威奇托

534
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,960
你知道这该死的公司变成什么样了吗?
Do you know how fucked this place is now?

535
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,270
我是那个...  那个...
I am the one thing... the one thing...

536
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:52,510
让公司不再一团糟的人
preventing this place from being totally fucked in the ass.

537
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:01,420
他们有时候需要发泄一下
Sometimes they just need to vent.

538
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:07,370
拜托  看在上帝的份上  下一个能不能让我开除?
Please, for the love of God, can I fire the next one?

539
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,560
- Barnes小姐  谢谢你参加  - 我要被开除了  是吗?
- Miss Barnes, thank you for joining us.  - I'm here to be fired, right?

540
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,610
我们是想和您谈谈您以后的计划
Well, we're here to talk about your future.

541
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:17,160
你不用说什么好听的  我明白你们想说什么
You don't have to sugar-coat it. I get the drill.

542
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,770
他们会给我什么?
What are they offering?

543
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,460
在文件夹里  你可以看到一个明晰的遣散费条款
Inside the packet, you'll find a clearly worked out severance package.

544
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,180
直接告诉我重点
Give me the bullet points.

545
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:26,790
其实条件很优厚...
It's actually pretty good...

546
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:29,240
三个月的工资  六个月的医疗保险
three months' pay, six months' medical.

547
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,320
还有由我们公司付款一年的就业咨询服务
And a full year of placement services through our company CTC.

548
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:36,390
求职咨询  真是慷慨啊
Placement services. That's generous.

549
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:42,240
一般的话  想找到一份年薪一万的工作只需要一个月的时间
Commonly it takes a month of searching for every $10,000 you expect to earn in salary.

550
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:45,530
- 这样说来我可以再等等看了  - 也不是这么说
- So I could be looking for a while.  - Not necessarily.

551
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:49,750
不要紧张  我对自己的计划还是很有信心的
Don't even sweat it. I'm pretty confident about my plans.

552
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,640
- 真的?  - 对
- Really?  - Yeah.

553
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:55,010
我家旁边有一座很美丽的大桥
There's this beautiful bridge by my house.

554
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,430
我要从上面跳下去
I'm gonna go jump off it.

555
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,930
Natalie啊
Natalie.

556
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,320
嘿!
Hey!

557
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,540
Natalie啊!
Natalie!

558
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,280
人们总是这样子说话的  这就是我们的工作
People say these things all the time. It's part of the trade.

559
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:18,810
- 真的?  - 对
- They do?  - Yeah.

560
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:24,340
他们会说很难听的话  他们会变得非常易怒
They say crazy things. They get worked up.

561
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:27,080
她看起来很平静的
She was really calm.

562
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,560
我觉得那是个很好的信号
I think that's a good sign.

563
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:34,450
- 所以他们其实并不会真的那么做?  - 不会  只是说说而已
- So they don't ever actually do it?  - No. No, it's just talk.

564
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,250
你怎么知道?  你跟踪调查过?
How do you know? Do you follow up?

565
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,410
没有  这种事当然没什么好结果  但是...
I mean, no, nothing good's gonna come of that, but..

566
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,370
我不会去操这种心
I wouldn't worry about it.

567
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:46,170
这就是我们的工作  Natalie
This is what we do, Natalie.

568
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:50,860
我们让人们在他们最脆弱的时候失去了依靠
We take people at their most fragile and we set them adrift.

569
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,260
准备好继续了吗?
Ready to go back in?

570
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:00,560
好的  走吧  来
All right, let's go. Come on.

571
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:16,090
堪萨斯城

572
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,840
塔尔萨

573
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:48,190
不  我很好  告诉我些开心的事吧
No, I'm fine. Tell me something sweet.

574
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:52,610
我很快就可以回去了  我也不知道实习会持续多久
I'll be back soon. I'm not sure how long this exercise is supposed to last.

575
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:56,650
不  我才没想过那方面的事呢  他那么老
No, I don't even think of him that way. He's old.

576
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,960
德梅因

577
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,960
- 我...  我被开除了?  - 我压根没想到  一点儿都没有
- I... I'm done?  - I wasn't expecting this. Not at all.

578
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,050
就这样?
Just like that?

579
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:44,920
我很失望  我付出了我生命中那么多的...
I'm disappointed that I've given so much of my life...

580
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,060
这不公平
This is not fair.

581
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,630
现在有那么多比我更适合这个职位的人
There are people who gonna be way more qualified than me now.

582
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,400
我不知道明天早上起床后  要做什么了
I don't know what to do when I wake up in the morning, tomorrow.

583
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,170
你还好吗?
You OK?

584
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:05,610
- 我们要走了?  - 对
- Are we going?  - Yeah.

585
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:16,120
迈阿密

586
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:26,120
我每天就是这么开始的
This is how I start every day of my life.

587
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,120
现在  可能会有一点困难  所以  跟着我的思路
Now, this is gonna be a little difficult, so stay with me.

588
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:33,140
你有一个新背包
You have a new backpack.

589
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:36,860
只是这次  我要你把它装满人
Only this time, I want you to fill it with people.

590
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:40,720
从泛泛之交开始  到朋友的朋友
Start with casual acquaintances, friends of friends,

591
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,470
再到公司的同事
folks around the office.

592
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,940
再到那些你相信  并愿意和他们分享你内心秘密的人...
And then the people you trust with your most intimate secrets...

593
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,460
你的堂兄妹  你的姑姑阿姨  你的叔叔舅舅
your cousins, your aunts, your uncles,

594
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:52,290
你的兄弟  你的姐妹  你的父母亲
your brothers, your sisters, your parents,

595
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:57,830
最后到了你的丈夫  你的老婆  你的男朋友  或是你的女朋友
and finally your husband, your wife, your boyfriend or your girlfriend.

596
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:01,470
你要把他们都装进那个背包里去
You get them into that backpack.

597
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:06,650
别着急  我不会让你们一把火烧掉的
Don't worry. I'm not gonna ask you to light it on fire.

598
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,080
感受那个背包的重量
Feel the weight of that bag.

599
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:15,900
不能犯错  你的人际关系是你人生中最重要的部分
Make no mistake, your relationships are the heaviest components in your life.

600
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:21,080
感受到陷进你肩膀里的带子的压力了吗?
Do you feel the straps cutting into your shoulders?

601
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:28,140
所有的谈判和争执  所有的秘密和妥协
All those negotiations and arguments, and secrets and compromises.

602
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:33,430
其实你不需要承受那么多重量的
You don't need to carry all that weight.

603
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:36,710
为什么不放下那背包呢?
Why don't you set that bag down?

604
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:44,170
有些动物生来就是为了互相扶持  一辈子都要生活在一起...
Some animals were meant to carry each other, to live symbiotically for a lifetime...

605
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:49,580
时运不济的恋人  终生一夫一妻制的天鹅  我们不是那些动物
star-crossed lovers, monogamous swans. We are not those animals.

606
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,550
我们运动得越慢  死得越快
The slower we move, the faster we die.

607
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,330
我们不是天鹅
We are not swans.

608
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,310
我们是鲨鱼
We're sharks.

609
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,580
- 永远不会?  - 不会
- Never?  - No.

610
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,770
- 从来没有?  - 没有

611
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:20,230

- Never want kids?  - Not a chance.

613
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,120
- 从来?  - 从来没有
- Ever?  - Never.

614
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:28,540
- 很奇怪吗?  - 是
- Is that so bizarre?  - Yes.

615
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:32,900
- 对  很奇怪  - 我只是没发现那样做的意义
- Yes, it is.  - I just don't see the value in it.

616
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,940
- 好吧  推销给我  - 什么?
- Right, sell it to me.  - What?

617
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:38,290
把婚姻推销给我
Sell me marriage.

618
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:43,080
- 好吧  爱不会让你想结婚吗?  - 好吧
- OK, how about love?  - OK.

619
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:46,250
稳定  就是你可以依靠某人...
Stability, just somebody you can count on...

620
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,980
你知道有多少稳定的婚姻吗?
How many stable marriages do you know?

621
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:51,340
可以和某人说话  可以和某人共度一生
Somebody to talk to, someone to spend your life with.

622
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:55,130
我周围全是可以说话的人  我觉得那是不会变的
I'm surrounded by people to talk to. I doubt that's not gonna change.

623
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,670
为了不会一个人死去?
How about just not dying alone?

624
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:03,140
从我12岁开始  我们就开始把我的祖父母送去养老院
Starting when I was 12, we moved each of my grandparents to a nursing facility.

625
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:07,800
我的父母也去了养老院  如果没说错的话  我们都会一个人死去的
My parents went the same way. Make no mistake, we all die alone.

626
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:12,680
不过  那些在圣地亚哥喝着最爱的饮料  穿着运动鞋的邪教份子...
Now, those cult members in San Diego, with the Kool-Aid and the sneakers...

627
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,890
倒不会一个人死去
they didn't die alone.

628
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,640
我只是说还有不同的选择
I'm just saying there are options.

629
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:22,770
我靠
Oh, fuck.

630
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,110
Brian抛弃我了
Brian left me.

631
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:34,460
没事了
All right.

632
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,160
好  好  没事了
OK. Ok. All right.

633
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:43,730
没事了  嘘  嘘
All right. Shh, shh.

634
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:50,540
嘿
Hey.

635
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,540
Natalie  这是我朋友Alex  这是Natalie
Natalie, this is Alex, my friend. This is Natalie.

636
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:03,300
我应该回避一下吗?
I should give you both a moment.

637
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:08,700
不  不  没关系的  我没事  很高兴见到你
No. No, that's fine. I'm fine. It's a pleasure to meet you.

638
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,140
也许我们应该回房间去洗把脸
Maybe we should just all go up to our rooms and freshen up.

639
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:15,610
- 或是喝一杯?  - 就按你说的
- Maybe a drink?  - Now you're talking.

640
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,430
Brian:  我觉得我们该分手了
Brian: I think it's time we C other people

641
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,410
他就用短信和你分手?
He broke up with you with a text message?

642
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,960
就像是通过网络解雇别人一样
Kind of like firing someone over the internet.

643
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:30,040
- 多狡猾的贱人  - 那我是啥?
- What a weaselly prick.  - But what does that make me?

644
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,560
- 爱上贱人的傻瓜  - 我们都会爱上他们的
- Someone who falls for a prick.  - We all fall for them.

645
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:35,460
贱人会很随意  不可捉摸  很有趣
Pricks are spontaneous, unpredictable and fun.

646
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,530
然后我们会很惊讶  原来他们那么无耻
Then we're surprised when they turn out to be pricks.

647
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,990
- 我是为了他来的奥马哈  - 真的?
- I followed him to Omaha.  - You did?

648
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,700
我本来在旧金山有一份工作的  但是他接到了康尼格拉的录用通知
I had a job waiting for me in San Francisco when he got an offer from ConAgra.

649
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,700
康尼格拉 - 美国食品公司

650
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,240
他说我们可以一起开创新生活
He said we could start a life together.

651
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,560
- 所以我跟着他  - 到了内布拉斯加?
- So I followed him.  - To Nebraska?

652
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:00,910
我以为我们会订婚的
I thought I'd be engaged by now.

653
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:02,600
不要见怪
No offence.

654
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:04,930
- 没发现  - 没关系
- None taken.  - That's all right.

655
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:09,730
当我16岁的时候  我觉得我23岁就会结婚
When I was 16, I thought by 23 I'd be married,

656
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:14,440
会有一个小孩  白天坐在办公室角落  晚上出去玩
maybe have a kid, corner office by day, entertaining at night.

657
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:16,700
我应该开着切诺基上班的
I was supposed to be driving a Grand Cherokee by now.

658
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:19,840
生活有时候会让你失望的
Life can underwhelm you that way.

659
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:23,230
我是说  你怎么知道你会在哪里被...
I mean, where did you think you'd be by um...

660
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:29,350
- 事实不总按着你的想法走的    C  在某处  你设定个截止期限
- It doesn't work that way.  - At a certain point, you stop with the deadlines.

661
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,900
有时候反而会适得其反
It can be counterproductive.

662
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,960
我不是反对男女平等
I don't want to say anything anti-feminist.

663
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:36,400
我很感激你们那一代人为我们女人做的一切
I really appreciate all your generation did for me.

664
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,290
- 是我们的荣幸  - 做得很不错
- It was our pleasure.  - Well done.

665
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:41,200
但是有时候我感觉  不论我有多成功
But sometimes it feels like, no matter how much success I have,

666
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:44,300
除非我找到了命中注定的那位  一切都不重要
it's not gonna matter until I find the right guy.

667
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:47,490
你真的觉得这个人就是那位吗?
You really thought this guy was the one?

668
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,940
我本可以实现的
I could have made it work.

669
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:53,090
他  呃...  他符合我的要求
He um... he really fit the bill.

670
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,470
- 你知道吗?  - 你的要求?
- You know?  - The bill?

671
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,030
白领阶层  大学学历
White collar, college grad.

672
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:02,230
喜欢小狗  喜欢喜剧  1米8的个子  褐色头发  迷人的双眼
Loves dogs, likes funny movies. Six-foot-one, brown hair, kind eyes,

673
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:07,820
专业是金融  但喜爱户外运动...  在周末
works in finance but is outdoorsy... you know, on the weekends.

674
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:14,010
我希望他有一个字的名字  像是Matt  或是John...
I always imagined he'd have a single syllable name like Matt or John...

675
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:16,060
或是Dave
or Dave.

676
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:19,100
在理想的世界中  他开着丰田的4Runner
In a perfect world, he drives a 4Runner, and

677
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,180
他爱他的黄金实验室胜过爱我
and the only thing he loves more than me is his golden lab.

678
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,500
还要有可爱的笑容
And a nice smile.

679
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:31,740
- 你呢?  - 让我想想
- What about you?  - Let me think.

680
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:38,040
实话说  当你34岁的时候  所有的身体条件已经不重要了
Honestly, by the time you're 34, all the physical requirements just go out the window.

681
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:41,880
比如你默默祈求他比你高
Like you secretly pray that he'll be taller than you.

682
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:47,240
他不是个混蛋就好了  他喜欢我的陪伴  他有个良好的家庭
Not an asshole would be nice. Someone who enjoys my company, comes from a good family.

683
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,450
你年轻的时候  不会想这些的
You don't think about that when you're younger.

684
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:53,650
我不知道...  他还应该想要孩子
I don't know... someone who wants kids.

685
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,750
喜欢小孩  想要小孩
Likes kids. Wants kids

686
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,800
身体健康  可以和孩子们一起玩
Healthy enough to play with his kids.

687
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:05,950
上帝拜托让他比我挣得比我多吧
Please let him earn more money than I do.

688
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:09,110
你可能现在不能了解  但相信我  总有一天你会了解的
You might not understand that now, but believe me, you will one day.

689
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,370
不然的话  那肯定就是一个灾难了
Otherwise that's a recipe for disaster.

690
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,440
而且希望他没有谢顶
And hopefully some hair on his head.

691
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:20,340
但是现在那也不是决定性因素了
But I mean even that's not a deal breaker these days.

692
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,850
一个可爱的笑容
A nice smile.

693
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:31,250
对  一个可爱的笑容  可爱的笑容很重要
Yeah, a nice smile. Nice smile just might do it.

694
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:35,970
哇  那真伤感
Wow, that was depressing.

695
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,460
- 我应该和女人约会了  - 我试过了
- I should just date women.  - Tried it.

696
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,270
我们一个人过不去的
We're no picnic ourselves.

697
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:49,300
我一点都不介意嫁给我的事业
I don't mind being married to my career.

698
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:53,220
我也不指望  它在我睡觉的时候抱着我
And I don't expect it to hold me in bed as I fall asleep.

699
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:00,040
我只是不想安顿下来
I just don't want to settle.

700
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:04,100
你还年轻  现在你认为安顿意味着失败
You're young. Right now you see settling as some sort of a failure.

701
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:07,930
那是...  我的定义
It is... by definition.

702
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:11,980
但是当你遇到对的人  你不会想要安顿
But by the time someone is right for you, it won't feel like settling.

703
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:13,580
那么唯一可以评判你的人
And the only person left to judge you

704
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:17,190
就是你身后那个有明确目标的23岁女孩
will be the 23-year-old girl with a target on your back.

705
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:23,540
晚上有什么计划?
So what's the plan for the evening?

706
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:28,240
我们本想去参加饭店里  那个科技会议举行的派对
Well, we were gonna hit that party for the tech conference at the hotel.

707
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:32,040
我不知道你们也能参加  我以为必须要登记的
I didn't know you could just attend those. I thought you had to register.

708
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:34,910
理论上说  那个派对不对外开放的
Technically, I don't think it's open to the public.

709
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:39,420
- 被拦下来  - 你们要闯进去?
- Stop by.  - You're gonna crash it?

710
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:47,640
- 通常会很好玩  - 不  我明白  我也要参加
- have a good time, usually. - No, no, I get it. I'm in.

711
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,650
Jennifer Chu?
Jennifer Chu?

712
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:12,770
- 靠!  - 啊  没关系的
- Shit!  - Ah, it'll be fine.

713
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:36,830
一切还好?
Doing all right?

714
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:40,910
是  这真是个好主意
Yeah. This was a great idea.

715
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:44,600
你真漂亮
You're so pretty.

716
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,510
我多希望自己15年后可以像你这样漂亮
You're exactly what I wanna look like in 15 years.

717
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:52,390
- 谢谢  Natalie  - 你应该跳舞
- Thank you, Natalie.  - You should dance.

718
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:57,000
- 来吧  - 不  不  不
- Come on.  - No, no, no.

719
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:59,840
- 来吧  - 噢!
- Come on.  - Oh!

720
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,690
- 我是Dave  - 我是Natalie
- I'm Dave.  - I'm Natalie.

721
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,260
那Jennifer是谁?
Who's Jennifer?

722
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,630
不知道
I don't know.

723
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,120
大家开心吗?
How's everybody doing out there?

724
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:34,180
现在  让我们热烈欢迎alphaTECH的特邀嘉宾
Right about now, give it up for a very special alphaTECH guest.

725
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:37,950

726
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,580
怎么样  alphaTECH?
What's up, alphaTECH?

727
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:44,710
我电脑最近坏了  有人能帮我修修吗?
I got a busted computer. Can somebody fix it for me?

728
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:36,970
我希望你能拿着我房间的钥匙
I want you to have a key to my place.

729
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:42,350
哇  我都不知道我们之间已经到了这个地步了
Wow. I had no idea we were at that point in our relationship.

730
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:45,270
- 当然有  - 哇
- Oh, yes.  - Wow.

731
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,210
她在哪儿?
Where is she?

732
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:57,580
#  我躺在床上  听着钟表滴答  想起了你  #
# Lyin' in my bed I hear the clock tick and think of you #

733
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:04,880
#  陷在回忆中  我无比困惑  #
# Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new #

734
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:12,380
#  回忆浮现  温暖的夜晚  几乎就要忘却  #
# Flash back Warm night Almost left behind #

735
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:16,580
#  箱子  记忆  不停的出现  #
# Suitcase Memories Time after some time #

736
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:28,580
回到家后  我就不会像现在和你一起时这样了
Back home I don't get to act the way I do with you.

737
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:32,630
- 这就是我为什么不回家的原因  - 我发现了
- That's why I don't have a back home.  - I know.

738
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:37,780
你真冷漠  空包先生
You're so cool. Mr Empty Backpack.

739
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,320
- 你知道我的背包理论?  - 我在Google上搜了一下
- You know about my backpack?  - I Googled you.

740
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,440
真的?
You did?

741
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:45,100
如今女生迷恋男生都会这样
It's what us modern girls do when we have a crush.

742
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,850
- 你不喜欢吗?  - 看情况了
- Does it bother you?  - It depends.

743
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:51,080
你要把背包清空  是因为讨厌人呢
Is the bag empty because you hate people

744
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:52,730
还是讨厌他们的背包?
or because you hate the baggage they come along with?

745
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:55,310
我不讨厌和人相处  我不能算一个隐士吧
I don't hate people. I'm not exactly a hermit.

746
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:00,090
你只是不想被那么多的责任所束缚
You just don't want to be tied down with the whole responsibility thing.

747
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,400
我不知道最初是什么启发我的空包思考
I don't know what originally sparked the backpack.

748
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:06,390
也许是因为我需要独处
Probably needed to be alone.

749
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:11,500
最近  我一直在想  在我知道应该把什么放进之前
Recently, I've been thinking that I needed to empty the backpack

750
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:14,610
应该先把它清空
before I know what to put back in it.

751
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:37,030
- 哦  不!  - 我想是汽油用完了
- Oh, no!  - I think we're out of gas.

752
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:19,330
嘿  你起来了?
Hey. You're up?

753
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:23,200
我要飞去辛辛那提去开个会
I have to fly standby and make a meeting in Cincinnati.

754
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:25,500
好吧
OK.

755
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:29,900
我伤你自尊了
I made you feel cheap.

756
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:33,920
没关系  把钱放化妆台就行了
It's all right. Just leave the money on the dresser.

757
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:38,050
过会儿我给你发短信  我们交换下行程表
I'll text you later so we can swap schedules.

758
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:41,120
嘿
Hey.

759
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,420
我真的很喜欢你
I really like you.

760
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:51,050
- 我也喜欢你  - 真好
- I like you too.  - Good.

761
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,190
去赶飞机吧
Go catch your plane.

762
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:08,860
昨晚  呃...
Last night er...

763
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:13,100
我有点失控  说的话...
It was kind of out of hand. I said things, erm...

764
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:16,500
我也不确定自己说了什么
I'm not actually sure everything that I said.

765
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:19,810
- 但请你不要认为...  - 没事
- But I didn't want you to think...  - Just relax.

766
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:22,630
看到你放松自我  我很高兴
It was nice to see you cut loose.

767
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:25,600
你叫醒他  还是溜出来的?
Did you wake him up or slip out?

768
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,810
- 什么?  - 今天早上  你的新朋友
- What?  - This morning. Your new friend.

769
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:31,750
你叫醒他  尴尬的说声再见  还是
Did you wake him up for an awkward goodbye, or did you

770
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:35,370
偷偷溜出来  像个妓女?
just slip out and make him feel like a whore?

771
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:40,390
- 我就那么走了  - 社交礼仪总是很麻烦
- I just left.  - Protocol's always tricky.

772
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:44,460
那Alex呢?
What happened to Alex?

773
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,650
她一早就出城了  赶着开会
She had to leave town early to get to a meeting.

774
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:50,830
- 真扫兴  她住哪?  - 芝加哥
- That's too bad. Where's she live?  - Chicago.

775
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:52,790
想去见她吗?
Thinking of going to see her?

776
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:56,980
我们关系没到那步  站那边试试
We don't really have that kind of relationship. Try it over there.

777
01:00:57,130 --> 01:01:00,840
那  呃...  你们是什么关系?
What erm... kind of relationship do you have?

778
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:04,190
就是那种...  很随意的
Well, you know... casual.

779
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:08,530
- 听起来蛮特别的  - 挺适合我们的
- Sounds pretty special.  - It works for us.

780
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:11,450
没想过你们会有未来吗?
Don't you think there's a future there?

781
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:14,040
我从来没想过  问这个干吗?
I never really thought about it. What's going on here?

782
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:17,050
- 真的从没想过?  - 从没
- Really never thought about it?  - No.

783
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:20,310
你居然从没想过你们的未来?
How can you not think about that?

784
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,100
你脑子就没闪现过  和某人共度余生的念头?
How does it not even cross your mind that you might want a future with someone?

785
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,730
很简单  当你看着某人的眼睛
It's simple. You know that moment when you look into somebody's eyes and you can

786
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:32,870
直触灵魂  全世界在那一刻静止?
feel them staring into your soul and the whole world goes quiet just for a second?

787
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,280
- 知道  - 是吧  可我没那感觉
- Yes.  - Right. Well, I don't.

788
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:38,160
你个混蛋
You're an asshole.

789
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,680
我只是消磨时间  快点  帮我拍完
You know, look, I'm just dicking around. Come on, give me a hand.

790
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,480
那你为什么不给她一个机会?
Dont't you think it's worth giving her a chance?

791
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,040
- 什么机会?  - 付出真感情的机会
- A chance for what?  - A chance at something real.

792
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:48,000
Natalie  对于"真感情"的理解  会随着年龄的增长改变
Natalie, your definition of real will evolve as you get older.

793
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:49,890
你能不能屈尊一下
Can you stop condescending for one second

794
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:52,510
还是那就是你那狗屁理论的原则?
or is that one of the principles of your bullshit philosophy?

795
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,430
- 狗屁理论?  - 什么独身  旅行
- Bullshit philosophy?  - The isolation, the travelling.

796
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:58,020
- 那样很有魅力吗?  - 不  只是种生活方式
- Is that supposed to be charming?  - No, simply a life choice.

797
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:01,350
- 那是自我放纵的借口  - 哇  过奖了
- It's a cocoon of self-banishment.  - Wow. Big words.

798
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:04,960
- 去你的  - 也去你的
- Screw you.  - Screw you, too.

799
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:05,900
你的生活方式基本上
You have set up a way of life that basically

800
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:09,300
基本上隔绝了人际交往
makes it impossible for you to have any kind of human connection.

801
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:13,290
现在有个女人出现  经历你那荒谬的生活方式的鞭打
And now this woman comes along and somehow runs the gauntlet of your ridiculous

802
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:17,530
还对你微笑  你却说她"随意"?
life choice, and comes out on the other end smiling just so you can call her "casual"?

803
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:21,360
我需要长大成熟?  你才是12岁的小朋友
I need to grow up? You're a 12-year-old.

804
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,250
我没有鞭打...
I don't have a gauntlet...

805
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:28,720
我靠
Fuck.

806
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:50,890
底特律

807
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:12,770
听着  这些底特律家伙不好对付  他们是老油条了
Listen, these Detroit guys can be tough. They're getting hammered.

808
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,970
别分心  把简单的事做好
So you don't get distracted. Stick with the simple stuff.

809
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:19,360
把资料给他们  请他们走人  明白吗?
Get these packets in their hands and get them out the door, OK?

810
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:34,450
嘿  欢迎来底特律
Hey, welcome to Detroit.

811
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:36,300
怎么回事?
What's going on here?

812
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:38,380
前几天我一直注意那些大生意
I've been looking at those great numbers on last few days.

813
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,380
觉得我们应该大胆点  试试这种方式
I thought maybe we should just nut up and give this a try.

814
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:41,960
我们需要多点时间
We use a little more time.

815
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:44,760
万事都有个开头  对吧?
Well, you gotta leave the nest at some point, huh?

816
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:47,650
这可是真正的公司  Craig  我们是来拆台的
This is a real company, Craig. We're here to do some damage.

817
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:51,430
我知道  但有你们两位精英  还怕什么?  开始吧
I know. It's a good thing we brought our best, okay? Let's stop screwing around.

818
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,610
给我一分钟做准备
Just give me a minute to prepare and get my things together.

819
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,470
这次让Natalie来吧
I was thinking Natalie was gonna take this one.

820
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,660
恐怕她还不能胜任吧
She's hardly ready for that.

821
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:01,760
最近我一直关注她的工作成绩  她很棒
I've been watched her results the last few days. She's great.

822
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:03,490
这次和以前的任务完全不同啊
This is a whole other animal.

823
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:08,460
这种方式就是她创造的  对吧?  Natalie你准备好了吗?
You know, she created it and everything right? Natalie, are you nut up for it?

824
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:11,090
没问题
Yeah, I'm game.

825
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,510
看你的表现
That's my girl.

826
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,840
记住了  千万别道歉  也别说自己也很为难
Just remember, don't apologize or tell them how hard this is for you.

827
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:19,940
今天将是他们  一生中最郁闷的一天
Today's one of the worst days they're ever gonna have in their life.

828
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:23,020
我们的同情太微不足道了
How we feel doesn't even compare.

829
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:28,490
- 了解  - 专业点  没事的
- Got it.  - Just keep it professional. You'll be fine.

830
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:33,540
这是干什么?  发生什么事了?
What's all this? What's going on?

831
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,480
您好啊  Samuels先生
Hello, Mr Samuels.

832
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:38,670
我也希望自己带给您的是好消息
I wish I were here with better news.

833
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:43,020
但是  您在Wall Timer公司的职位保不住了
However, your position here at Wall Timer's is no longer available.

834
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,090
什么意思?
What are you talking about?

835
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:49,080
您被解雇了
You've been let go.

836
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,540
就这么简单?
Just like that?

837
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,090
你是谁啊?
Who are you?

838
01:04:55,840 --> 01:05:00,340
我是Keener女士  今天是来和您谈条件的
My name is Miss Keener and I'm here today to talk about your options.

839
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:06,590
我为这个公司干了17年  他们就派个本科毕业生开了我?
I worked for this company for 17 years and they send a 4th-grader to can me?

840
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:10,090
这他妈的太过分了?
What the fuck is this?

841
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:21,150
您会这么生气  我很理解
It's perfectly normal to be upset.

842
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,860
不过  您尽早接受事实
However, the sooner you can tell yourself

843
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:24,680
就能尽快找到更好的工作机会
the greater opportunities are waiting for you.

844
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:29,050
更好的工作机会?  我他妈的都57岁了
Greater opportunities? I'm 57 fucking years old.

845
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:35,880
那些曾建立帝国  改变世界的伟人们  也有过你这样的遭遇
Anybody who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you are now.

846
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,740
也正因为他们经历过  他们才能做到
And it's because they sat there that they were able to do it.

847
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:50,060
您面前有份资料  希望您花时间读下
There's a packet in front of you. I want you to take some time and review it.

848
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:54,820
您的问题  资料里都有答案
All the answers you're looking for are inside those pages.

849
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:00,270
你越早接受现实
The sooner you trust the process,

850
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:03,470
您才能尽快开始新生活
the sooner the next step of your life will unveil itself.

851
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:13,040
现在请您回办公室
I need you to go back to your office now

852
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,360
收拾自己的个人物品
and start putting together your personal things.

853
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:37,220
Samuels先生  我们的谈话结束了
Mr Samuels, that's all we can discuss now.

854
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:43,300
Samuels先生
Mr Samuels.

855
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,840
Samuels先生
Mr Samuels.

856
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:59,740
Samuels先生!
Mr Samuels!

857
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,960
表现得不错啊
You did good.

858
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:21,460
你还好吧?  要我接手吗?
You oK? You want me to take over?

859
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,840
不用了  我没事
No, I'm all right.

860
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:44,440
我们刚到这  这只是开始  我认为得多试几个
Look, we just got here. That's one place. I think we need to try a few more.

861
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:45,840
或许没什么区别
Maybe it doesn't make difference,

862
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,720
但让他们知道  我们就坐在隔壁  起码有点安抚作用
but it's comforting to know that we're in the next room.

863
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:52,070
我知道你才不管什么安抚
I know you don't give a shit about my comfort.

864
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:56,130
我就是想说  得多试几个
I think we could try a few more, that's all I'm saying.

865
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,390
好吧
Fine.

866
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:07,720
没事  好的  没事
All right. OK. All right.

867
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:16,310
他说你表现很棒  确实是
He thought you did a great job. You did.

868
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:20,690
- 我为你骄傲  - 谢谢
- I'm real proud of you.  - Thanks.

869
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:25,380
他们想让我们回去
They're pulling us off the road.

870
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:28,380
我们要回家了
We're going home.

871
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:33,960
- 真的?  不再回来了?  - 是啊
- Really? For good?  - Yeah.

872

我们有幸邀请您参加Julie Anne Bingham和James Arthur Miller的婚礼

874
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:06,450
关于Alex的那些话  我很抱歉  有点过分了
I'm sorry about what I said about Alex. That was out of line.

875
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:08,710
没事  我理解
It's all right. I understand.

876
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:12,220
我是谁啊  还给你提恋爱建议?
I mean, who am I to be doling out relationship advice, right?

877
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:14,820
别开玩笑了
No kidding.

878
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,840
你没事吗?
Are you gonna be oK?

879
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:24,550
- 什么意思?  - 在奥马哈?
- What do you mean?  - In Omaha?

880
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:29,060
我也不知道
I don't know.

881
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:32,560
比你想象得好
It's better than you'd think.

882
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:43,090
Ryan
Ryan.

883
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:47,390
- Ryan  你去哪?  - 我搭另一班飞机
- Ryan. Where are you going?  - I'm grabbing another flight.

884
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:51,820
有点事要处理  回家见
Something I've got to take care of. I'll see you back at home.

885
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:12,770
好的  走近一点
OK, just walk it in a little.

886
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:14,820
再近点
A little more.

887
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:18,620
很好
There you go. Yeah.

888
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,130
搞定
Got it.

889
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:27,860
他们真可爱
They're a cute couple.

890
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:31,200
- 你这么认为?  - 是啊  他们的孩子一定漂亮
- You think so?  - Yeah, they'll make cute kids.

891
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,910
你觉得二月去威斯康辛州怎样?
How do you like Wisconsin in February?

892
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:40,160
你在那我就喜欢  我知道  密尔瓦基市有家很棒的汉堡店
I like it if you're there. I know a killer burger in Milwaukee.

893
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:42,050
北威斯康辛州
Northern Wisconsin.

894
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,570
这周末有安排吗?
What are you doing this weekend?

895
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,140
- 不会吧  - 什么  我还没...
- No.  - What, I haven't...

896
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:53,470
- 你要我做你的约会对象?  - 是啊  是啊
- You want me to be your date?  - Yeah. Yeah.

897
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:57,080
- 参加你妹妹的婚礼?  - 我和她的关系没那么亲
- At your sister's wedding?  - It's not like I know her that well.

898
01:10:57,690 --> 01:11:01,110
我不是那种结婚型的  好吗?
Look, I'm not the wedding type, right?

899
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:03,830
但有生以来第一次  我不想独自一人坐在酒吧里
But for the first time in my life I don't want to be that guy alone at a bar.

900
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,600
我想有个舞伴  想要个"另一伴"
I want a dance partner, I want a "plus one".

901
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:10,710
如果你能接受的话  我希望那个人是你
And if you can stomach it, I'd like it to be you.

902
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,840
密尔沃基

903
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:37,820
打搅下  你有空吗?
Excuse me. Are you available?

904
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:42,000
这边只对参加"马特洪峰计划"的会员开放
This line's for members of our Matterhorn Programme.

905
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:49,500
嘿...  Ryan

908
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,570
你好啊
Well, hello.

909
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:03,650
Ryan从来没和我提过你
Ryan's told me nothing about you.

910
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:06,910
你们俩在约会吗?
So you two are dating?

911
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:11,230
- 不算吧  - 嘿  不用担心
- Not exactly.  - Well, hey, don't worry about it.

912
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:14,290
我们这个年龄还叫对方女朋友有点过了
We're all getting a little old to be calling someone girlfriend.

913
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:17,680
我还记得  妈妈说Jack是她男朋友  上帝啊
I remember when mom used to call Jack her boyfriend. God.

914
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:21,990
让我撞墙算了  小孩们才叫男朋友  对吧?
Drove me up the wall. Boyfriends are for kids, right?

915
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:24,920
你在旅馆干吗呢?
So what are you doing at the hotel?

916
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:30,480
呃...  我和Frank正试着分居
Yeah, oK, er... Frank and I are trying out a trial separation.

917
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:32,620
抱歉  那么你不在家住了?
I'm sorry. So you're not staying at the house?

918
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:34,660
不住了  旅馆有个房间
No, there was a room on hold here,

919
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:38,020
所以我周末就过来住
so I thought I'd just take it for the weekend.

920
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:44,430
- 婚前晚宴什么时候?  - 哦  对  就今晚  到时候见
- So the rehearsal dinner?  - Oh, yeah, tonight. I'll see you two there.

921
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,050
房间不错嘛
Nice digs.

922
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:54,860
一本宣传册
There's a packet.

923
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:01,970
嘿  快看谁来了
Hey, look who's here.

924
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:07,230
- 哦  天那!  哦  天那!  Ryan!  - 嘿
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Ryan!  - Hey.

你真漂亮  Kara说的没错
You are so beautiful. Kara was right.

927
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:23,560
老天  你好成熟啊
Gosh. You look so grown-up.

928
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,180
我吗?  可是快结婚的人是你啊
I do? You're the one that's getting married.

929
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:28,770
哦  没错?
Oh, I know, right?

930
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:32,670
哦  你们还没看我的戒指呢
Oh. You haven't even seen my ring.

931
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,590
- 哦  快看啊  - 哦  真精致
- Oh, look at that.  - Oh, it's lovely.

932
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,040
Jim设计的
Jim designed it.

933
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:39,650
嘿  Jim
Hey, Jim.

934
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:43,140

935
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:45,790
- 嘿  我是Ryan  - Jim  见到你很高兴
- Hey. I'm Ryan.  - Jim. Good to meet you.

936

- Alex  - 很荣幸
- Alex.  - Pleasure.

937
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:47,800
很荣幸
Pleasure.

938
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:51,290
谢谢你们的到来
Thank you, guys, for coming.

939
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:53,880
哥!
Brother!

940
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:58,170
- 真的哦  - 是啊  疯狂
- It's true, though.  - Yeah, it's crazy.

941
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:03,720
- 我把你们要的照片带来了  - 贴那里就行了
- I got the pictures you asked me to get.  - You can just put them right there.

942
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:08,140
好的
Yeah, oK.

943
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:38,440
那里贴了好多啊    差点找不到地方
You got so many up there, I almost didn't have room.

944
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:42,500
是啊  很棒吧  大家都帮忙了
I know. It's so great, everyone just chipped in.

945
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:45,840
从哪来的灵感  这个主意好...
What gave you the idea to do something so...

946
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:48,660
- 有意义  - 呃...
- Substantial.  - Well...

947
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:52,800
Jim把我们大部分存款都投在了房地产生意上
Jim has a lot of our nest egg invested in this real estate venture.

948
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:55,750
嗯  房产投资
Mm-hm. It's a real estate investment.

949
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,710
很兴奋  但是我们算了一下帐发现...
It's exciting, but we went over our finances and...

950
01:14:58,790 --> 01:15:00,660
蜜月旅行  在这种情况下
A honeymoon just called, at this state in the game,

951
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:02,960
还真的付不起了
just doesn't really seem affordable.

952
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,030
所以  我们就想
So, you know, we just thought,

953
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:08,760
没钱旅行  不代表不能拍照啊
just because we can't travel doesn't mean we can't have pictures.

954
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,400
- 我觉得这个点子棒极了  - 是啊  很棒
- I think that's a fabulous idea.  - Yeah, it's a good one.

955
01:15:11,490 --> 01:15:14,600
我们的理念是一条龙服务
I mean the concept is turnkey everything.

956
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:16,940
好  当你买下房子就等于买了份维修合约
Ok, you buy a maintenance contract when you get the home. You know,

957
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:19,680
我们替你修剪草坪  换灯泡  还有家具
we'll whack your weeds, we'll change your light bulbs, furniture,

958
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:22,780
你可以用自己的  或者选择我们的精美套装
you can bring your own or pick one of our beautiful packages.

959
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:26,700
- 传承经典  获益无限  - 不错啊
- Seamless traditionalism, yet all the perks.  - Nice.

960
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:32,320
我们都需要自己的家园  这是美国人的梦想
We all need a place to call our own. This is America. This is who we were promised.

961
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:36,050
- 画龙点睛  - 什么?
- It's a nice touch  - What?

962
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:38,270
最后"诺言"那句  我喜欢
The bit at the end about the promise. I like that part.

963
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:41,420
哦  谢谢
Oh, thanks.

964
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:47,920
你  呃...  还租住那一居室呢?  - 没  不了
- You er...you still renting that one-bedroom?  - No. I gave it up.

965
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:50,750
- 那么你买下了?  - 没
- So you own now?  - No.

966
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,900
但是你一直观望着?
But you're looking?

967
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:55,730
没有
No, not really.

968
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:58,150
那你现在很好?
So you're just good?

969
01:15:58,490 --> 01:16:01,630
- 我很好  - 哦  那就好
- I'm good.  - Well, that's good.

970
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:05,590
明天你就结婚了?  今晚怎么能睡着啊?
Can you believe it's tomorrow? How are you gonna sleep?

971
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:07,670
我也不知道
I don't know.

972
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,190
- 要不要吃点阿普唑仑?(性药)  - 那不是有助睡眠的吧
- Well, do you want some Xanax?  - I don't think that's for sleeping.

973
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:14,860
恩  不了  我喝杯温牛奶吧
Yeah. No, I think I'll just have a glass of warm milk.

974
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:18,750
- 那就够了  - 好的  明天见
- That'll do the trick.  - OK. See you tomorrow.

975
01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:22,760
里面还有个箱子
There's another box inside.

976
01:16:22,850 --> 01:16:24,420
- 我去拿  - 你确定?
- I'll grab it.  - You sure?

977
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:27,210
是啊  是啊
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

978
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:38,680
- Jim看起来很不错啊  - 是啊  很棒吧?
- Jim seems like a good guy.  - Yeah, isn't he great?

979
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,770
他会是个好老公
He's gonna make a great husband.

980
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:48,980
Julie  我在想  老爸不在这里  呃...
You know, Julie, I was thinking, you know, with dad not being here, erm...

981
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:53,170
不知道你有没有找到人  和你一起步入婚礼殿堂
I was wondering if you had anybody to walk you down the aisle.

982
01:16:58,090 --> 01:17:02,760
- 恩  Jim的叔叔陪我  - 他真的很热心
- No, Jim's uncle is gonna do it.  - He's been really supportive.

983
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,480
他是个好人
He's been great.

984
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:08,590
呃  很好  非常好  我就是想确定你...
Well, good. That's great. I just wanted to make sure that you...

985
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:12,180
我想有人照顾你  就这样
I wanted you to be covered, that's all.

986
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:17,140
那么  我应该几点到?
So, I should be there, what?

987
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:23,300
宾客们五点到  婚礼五点半开始  所以...
The other guests are arriving around five and things get going at five-thirty so...

988
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:26,290
- 那会来吧  - 好的
- around then.  - OK.

989
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:31,810
哦  让我...  帮你拿吧
Oh. Let me... I'm gonna help you with those.

990
01:17:32,890 --> 01:17:35,090
接着了
Got it.

991
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:39,730
没事的  没事  没事
It's OK. It's OK, it's OK.

992
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:49,760
以前的都不在了
None of that was here.

993
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:52,610
都是新建的
This is all new.

994
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:04,840
真的?
Really?

995
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:08,890
- 你就这点本事?  - 什么?
- Is that all you got?  - What?

996
01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:17,810
抬我一下
Give me a boost.

997
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:21,000
小心点...
Watch...

998
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:23,670
等着我
Hang on.

999
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:32,670
我在这上过地理课
I took Geography in here.

1000
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,190
你有没有和老师乱搞过?
You ever fool around with one of your teachers?

1001
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:39,760
- 没  你有过?  - 没  大学的时候才干这事
- No. Did you?  - No. Not until college.

1002
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:46,920
右边那个是我
That's me on the right.

1003
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:52,620
- 不好认啊  - 看眉毛就知道了
- It's kinda hard to tell.  - You can tell by the eyebrows.

1004
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:57,070
- 你打过篮球?  - 我可是组织后卫(组织后卫是球队的灵魂)  别吃惊
- You played basketball?  - I was a point guard. Don't act so surprised.

1005
01:18:57,150 --> 01:19:00,610
没想到你还是篮球队的呢
I didn't know you were such a jock.

1006
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,940
那也是我
That's me too.

1007
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:05,990
还有那个
And that.

1008
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,800
- 第一次打架的地方  - 战绩如何?
- My first fight.  - How'd it go?

1009
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:12,340
被揍得屁滚尿流
Got my ass kicked.

1010
01:19:12,430 --> 01:19:20,870
- 这是我们亲热的地儿  - 哦  是啊  恩  好浪漫
- This is where we used to go to make out.  - Oh, yes. Yeah. This is very romantic.

1011
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:37,290
- 我很开心和你一起来这  - 我也是
- I'm really happy I came here.  - So am I.

1012
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:45,890
是Kara  嘿
It's Kara. Hi.

1013
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:48,900
Ryan  你在哪呢?  出大事了
Ryan, where are you? We're having a meltdown here.

1014
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:50,080
怎么了?  出什么事了?
What's going on? What happened?

1015
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:52,440
是Jim  你能回来吗?  需要你帮忙
It's Jim. Can you get back here? We need your help.

1016
01:19:52,530 --> 01:19:54,870
好的
OK.

1017
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,950
我们得走了
We gotta go.

1018
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:04,250
- 我帮你拿衣服  - 谢谢
- I'll grab your suit.  - Thanks.

1019
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:25,090
- 发生什么了?  - Jim怯场了
- What happened?  - Jim's got cold feet.

1020
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:27,830
- 今天?  - 是的  的确如此
- Today?  - Yeah, that's how cold feet work.

1021
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,960
- 你要我做什么呢?  - 和他谈谈
- What do you want me to do?  - Talk to him.

1022
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,940
- 你要我和他谈?  - 喂  这事儿不是你做就是我做
- You want me to talk to him?  - Hey, it's either you or me.

1023
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:36,510
你知道我的过去  我已经失败过一次了
You know my track record. I've already struck out once.

1024
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:39,100
我一点经验的都没有
I haven't been to bat. I haven't been in the dugout.

1025
01:20:39,190 --> 01:20:41,840
你不是靠说话谋生的吗?  励志类的?
Don't you talk for a living? Motivational-type stuff?

1026
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:44,550
我告诉人们怎么逃避义务
I tell people how to avoid commitment.

1027
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:46,100
你说的是什么鬼话?
What fuck kind of message is that?

1028
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:47,860
- 那是生活哲学  - 那太蠢了
- It's a philosophy.  - It's stupid.

1029
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:51,090
- 嗨  那也许能帮到你  - Ryan
- Hey, it could have helped you.  - Ryan.

1030
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:56,440
你很少在我们身边  他妈的...  你根本就没出现过
You haven't been around much. Fuck... Basically, you don't exist to us.

1031
01:20:56,530 --> 01:20:59,360
我知道你想帮她
I know you wanna be there for her.

1032
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:03,850
好  现在正是时候  你的机会来了
Well, here it is. This is your chance.

1033
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:27,120
嗨  怎么了  Ryan?
Hey. What's up, Ryan?

1034
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:31,570
- Jim  - 你读过这本书吗?
- Jim.  - You ever read this before?

1035
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:36,600
- 读过  那本书很不错...  - 我也觉得...
- Yeah, it's pretty powerful stuff...  - I'll say...

1036
01:21:38,950 --> 01:21:44,820
呃...  Kara说你有一些顾虑
Er... Kara mentioned that you were having some thoughts.

1037
01:21:44,970 --> 01:21:49,760
我想我没法...  呃...  和Kara结婚
I don't think I'm going to be able to... er... to do this.

1038
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:53,750
你为什么...  今天才说?
Why would you say that... today?

1039
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:58,120
嗯  昨天晚上我躺在床上睡不着
Well, last night I was kinda laying in bed and I couldn't get to sleep.

1040
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:01,530
我就开始想婚礼  想结婚仪式
So I started thinking about the wedding and the ceremony,

1041
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:05,010
接着我们买房一起生活
and about our buying a house and moving in together.

1042
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:08,930
我们会有一个孩子  然后有第二个
And having a kid, and having another kid and then.

1043
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,590
圣诞节  感恩节  春假
Christmas and Thanksgiving and spring break.

1044
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:15,150
参加足球比赛  然后转眼他们就要毕业了
Going to football games, and then all of a sudden they're graduating.

1045
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:19,280
要找工作结婚  然后你知道  我就成爷爷了
They're getting jobs, getting married. And, you know, I'm a grandparent.

1046
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:22,680
然后我退休  脱发  发福
And then I'm retired. I'm losing my hair. I'm getting fat.

1047
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:25,240
再后来  你想  我就死了
And then the next thing you know I'm dead.

1048
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:29,920
我只是  好像...  忍不住去想  那都有什么意义?
I'm just, like... I can't stop from thinking, what's the point?

1049
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:35,440
我是说  意义何在?
I mean, what is the point?

1050
01:22:35,530 --> 01:22:40,510
- 意义?  - 我意思是  我这是要干什么?
- The point?  - I mean, what am I starting here?

1051
01:22:41,410 --> 01:22:44,860
Jim  这就是...  婚姻
Jim, it's... marriage.

1052
01:22:45,130 --> 01:22:49,590
这是世上最美好的事情之一  每个人都向往
It's one of the most beautiful things on the earth. It's what people aspire to.

1053
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:52,580
- 你都没有结过婚  - 那倒是
- You never got married.  - That's true.

1054
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:56,960
- 我是说  你甚至都没有尝试过  - 嗯  尝试的定义各有不同
- I mean, you never even tried.  - Well, it's hard to define try.

1055
01:22:57,050 --> 01:23:01,520
我不清楚  只是似乎你比我那些已婚的朋友更开心
I don't know, just you seem happier than all my married friends.

1056
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:06,920
听着  Jim  我不想说谎  婚姻很讨厌
Look, Jim, I'm not going to lie to you. Marriage can be a pain in the ass.

1057
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:11,790
你是对的  这一切是你走向死亡的过程
And you're right. This all is just stuff that leads to your eventual demise.

1058
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:13,930
- 就是  - 我们都坐在时间的车轮上
- Yes.  - And we're all on running clocks.

1059
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:17,360
我们无法放慢或暂停它
And they can't be slowed down or paused.

1060
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:21,800
- 还有...  最终我们的生命都会结束  - 是的
- And... we all end up in the same place.  - Yeah.

1061
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:27,950
- 没有意义  - 没有意义  这就是我要说的
- There is no point.  - There is no point. That's what I'm saying.

1062
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,940
你要知道  呃...
You know, er...

1063
01:23:35,330 --> 01:23:39,590
我通常不会跟你说这些事情
I'm not normally the guy you would talk to about stuff like this.

1064
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:45,170
但你试想下...
If you think about it...

1065
01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:50,310
你人生中最珍贵的回忆  最重要的时刻
Your favourite memories, the most important moments in your life.

1066
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,670
是独自一人吗?
Were you alone?

1067
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:56,880
不  我想不是的
No, I guess not.

1068
01:23:57,210 --> 01:23:59,250
再想想这个
Come to think of it.

1069
01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:01,100
昨晚  婚礼前夜
Last night, the night before your wedding

1070
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:02,540
当这些该死的想法萦绕在你的脑海时
when all this shit is swirling around in your head,

1071
01:24:02,630 --> 01:24:05,070
你是在单人间里吗?
weren't you guys in separate bedroom?

1072
01:24:05,150 --> 01:24:07,730
是  Julie回公寓了
Yeah, Julie went back to the apartment

1073
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:10,490
我呆在蜜月套房里
and I was just by myself in the honeymoon suite.

1074
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:14,380
- 是不是有点孤单?  - 是的  挺孤单
- Kinda lonely, huh?  - Yes, it was pretty lonely.

1075
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:18,380
所以  有伴侣的人生才更美好
Life's better with company.

1076
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:23,630
- 是的...  - 每个人都需要有个人扶持
- Yeah...  - Everybody needs a co-pilot.

1077
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:28,170
- 说的好  - 谢谢
- That was a nice touch.  - Thanks.

1078
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:35,100
- 所以  呃  她在外边心情怎样?  - 不好
- So er... what's the mood like out there?  - It's not good.

1079
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:39,010
- 她是不是很生气?  - 就是有点难过
- She's pretty pissed?  - Just upset.

1080
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:42,940
我该怎么办?
What should I do?

1081
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:46,580
去找她
Go get her.

1082
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:03,830
我是个混蛋  我那么爱你
I'm such a fuck-up. I love you so much.

1083
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:07,040
你愿意陪我共度余生吗?
Will you be my co-pilot?

1084
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:11,660
愿意  愿意
Yes. Yes.

1085
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,520
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

1086
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:56,750
嗯  你到了
OK, this is your stop.

1087
01:28:02,890 --> 01:28:07,620
- 我什么时候能再见到你?  - 你过来就行
- When am I gonna see you?  - You're just gonna have to come visit.

1088
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:10,520
哦...  安顿下来了
Oh... so settled.

1089
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:17,910
- 你会因为我而改变了吧  是吗?  - 不  人没变  只多个地址
- You're not gonna change on me, are you?  - No. Same guy. Just one address.

1090
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:23,940
飞往芝加哥的3972号航班就要起飞了
This is your final boarding call for Flight 3972 to Chicago.

1091
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:28,600
好吧  寂寞的时候给我打电话
Right. Call me when you get lonely.

1092
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:33,310
我寂寞了
I'm lonely.

1093
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:46,310
奥马哈

1094
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:07,800
员工们坐在会议室里
Some guy sits in a conference room somewhere

1095
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:11,160
我们的服务器会把将他们分配给我们的终结工程师
and our server routes his session to one of our termination engineers.

1096
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:12,860
"终结工程师"?  是吗?
"Termination engineers"? Really?

1097
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:15,590
我更喜欢"终结者"  但怕引起法律纠纷
I preferred "terminators" but it bumped with Legal.

1098
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,060
难以置信
Can't imagine why.

1099
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:19,630
工作流程会训练工程师们应付各种被解雇者
The workflow takes them through anything

1100
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,080
工作流程会训练工程师们应付各种被解雇者
from a standard dismissal to a violent aggressor.

1101
01:29:21,170 --> 01:29:23,310
他们现在在做什么  练习吗?
What are they doing now, practising?

1102
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:27,940
公开测试  角色扮演  这个月底要投入实际使用
Beta testing, role-playing. We go live at the end of the month.

1103
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:30,420
Kyle  你说的太快了
Kyle, you're running through the events too quickly.

1104
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:34,350
给他们点时间接受你的陈述  这是合法的
Give them time to acknowledge each statement. It's a legal thing.

1105
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:38,590
- Ryan?  - 嗯?  好  还有吗?
- Ryan?  - Mm? Oh. Yeah. There's more?

1106
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:46,170
这太荒唐了
This is ridiculous.

1107
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:51,440
"终止"这个词的合法化让我很难接受...
Legal's starting to come hard at me on this term "terminate"...

1108
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:19,660
活出你的精彩!
Life to the power of you!

1109
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:33,050
先生们  女士们  掌声欢迎今天的演讲挑战者
Ladies and gentlemen. Put your hands together for today's challenge speaker,

1110
01:30:33,130 --> 01:30:36,100
Ryan Bingham先生
Mr Ryan Bingham

1111
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:39,050
好好表现
Go get 'em.

1112
01:30:48,930 --> 01:30:53,400
去年  我飞行了35万英里
Last year I flew 350,000 miles.

1113
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:56,200
地球到月球也就25万英里
The moon is 250.

1114
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:03,080
试想下  当你带着行李
I want you to imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack.

1115
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:06,300
你感受下肩上承受的重量
I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders.

1116
01:31:06,910 --> 01:31:09,030
感受到了吗?
You feel 'em?

1117
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:15,470
而我想让你们将生命的一切装入行囊
Now I want you to pack it with all the stuff that you have in your life.

1118
01:31:15,850 --> 01:31:22,530
从小东西开始...  架子上或是抽屉里的
Start with the little things. The things on shelves and in drawers.

1119
01:31:40,910 --> 01:31:43,540
抱歉
Excuse me.

1120
01:31:46,330 --> 01:31:48,420
你他妈的在干吗?
What the fuck are you doing?

1121
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:51,460
稍安勿躁  我们马上有请下一位演讲者
Relax. We'll have your next guest out in one sec.

1122
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:12,460
芝加哥

1123
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:18,220
- 嗨  你得签字  - 行
- Hey, you gotta sign.  - OK.

1124
01:32:19,230 --> 01:32:21,650
嗯  谢谢
OK, thank you.

1125
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:28,160
喂  你忘了给我Hertz(美国汽车租赁巨头)的贵宾金卡!
Hey, you forgot to give me your Hertz No.1 Gold Card!

1126
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:05,620
我正好在这附近
So I was in the neighbourhood.

1127
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:25,210
- 亲爱的  谁敲门?  - 过路的  他迷路了
- Hey, honey, who's at the door?  - Just somebody who's lost.

1128
01:34:22,830 --> 01:34:24,030
Alex?
Alex?

1129
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:27,050
你在想什么  就这么出现在我家门口?
What were you thinking, showing up at my door like that?

1130
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:30,990
你什么意思?  我想见你  我不知道你有家庭
What do you mean? I wanted to see you. I didn't know you had a family.

1131
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:32,790
你为什么不告诉我?
Why didn't you tell me that?

1132
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:36,720
很抱歉毁了你的夜晚  但是你也差点毁掉了我的生活
Sorry I ruined your evening but you could have screwed things up for me.

1133
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:41,370
那是我的家人  我真正的生活
That's my family. That's my real life.

1134
01:34:42,950 --> 01:34:46,460
我还以为我们初衷相同呢
I thought I was a part of your real life.

1135
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:49,960
我以为我们想法一致
I thought we signed up for the same thing.

1136
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:55,900
跟我说说你的初衷
Try and help me understand exactly what it is that you signed up for.

1137
01:34:56,330 --> 01:35:00,960
我想我们的关系很明确  我是说...
I thought our relationship was perfectly clear. I mean...

1138
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:04,420
你是我的逃避
you are an escape.

1139
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:08,440
你是我正常生活的一种调剂  就像...
You're a break from our normal lives, you're a...

1140
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:11,580
一段插曲
a parenthesis.

1141
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:15,510
我是一段插曲?
I'm a parenthesis?

1142
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,960
我是说...  你想要什么?
I mean... what do you want?

1143
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:23,600
告诉我你想要什么
Tell me what you want.

1144
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:30,450
你根本就不知道你要什么
You don't even know what you want.

1145
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:34,940
Ryan  我是成年人了  好吗?
Ryan, I'm a grown-up, OK?

1146
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:40,420
如果你还想见我  给我电话
So if you would like to see me again, then then give me a call.

1147
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:43,640
好吗?
OK?

1148
01:35:58,660 --> 01:36:01,650
先生们  女士们  下面播放一则特别通告
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special announcement to make.

1149
01:36:01,730 --> 01:36:06,100
机长告诉我  我们将要飞过迪比克市
Our pilot has just informed me that we are passing over the city of Dubuque,

1150
01:36:06,190 --> 01:36:11,630
也许对大家毫无意义  但对一位乘客却意义非凡
which might not mean much to most of you, but means a lot to one of our flyers today.

1151
01:36:11,710 --> 01:36:17,740
- 哦  不要  - 他的飞行里程突破了1000万英里!
- Oh, no.  - Because he just hit 10 million miles!

1152
01:36:20,430 --> 01:36:23,460
- 祝贺你  - 如此惊人的数字
- Congratulations.  - Such an amazing accomplishment.

1153
01:36:23,550 --> 01:36:26,280
你一定很激动吧
You must be very excited.

1154
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:28,780
- 机长好  - 机长
- Hi, Captain.  - Captain.

1155
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:31,180
那个位子有人吗?
That seat taken?

1156
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:33,800
没  没有
No. No.

1157
01:36:39,810 --> 01:36:43,170
你是突破1000万英里中最年轻的人
You're the youngest yet to hit 10 mil.

1158
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:46,250
不知道你是怎么挤出时间来的
Don't know where you found the time.

1159
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:49,820
我也不知道
Yeah. I don't know.

1160
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:56,990
这给你
Here you go.

1161
01:36:58,470 --> 01:37:01,420
我们制作的第七张卡
Seventh card we've made.

1162
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:04,130
很少人拥有它

1163
01:37:05,730 --> 01:37:09,540
我们由衷感谢您的支持
We really appreciate your loyalty.

1164
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:14,970
你知道  我曾多少次梦想这一刻?
You know how many times I thought about this moment?

1165
01:37:16,870 --> 01:37:20,320
幻想着你和我在这里谈话
Played out the conversation that you and I would have right here.

1166
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,580
真的吗?
Really?

1167
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:27,530
那你想说什么?
What did you want to say?

1168
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:34,360
我不记得了
You know, I don't remember.

1169
01:37:35,890 --> 01:37:40,610
没关系  这很正常
That's all right. It happens to all of us.

1170
01:37:43,590 --> 01:37:46,160
你哪里人?
So where are you from?

1171
01:37:51,710 --> 01:37:54,180
我属于这里
I'm from here.

1172
01:38:11,890 --> 01:38:14,220
你好  Bingham先生
Hello, Mr Bingham.

1173
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,410
你怎么知道是我?
How did you know it was me?

1174
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:18,270
这是您的专线
This is your dedicated line.

1175
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:21,270
我们为顶级会员提供的
We reserve them for our most loyal and appreciated flyers.

1176
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:23,510
我想转换一些我的里程数
I'd like to transfer some of my miles.

1177
01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:26,910
我能否为Jim和Julie Miller开个账户?
Can I open up an account to Jim and Julie Miller?

1178
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,760
可以  你想转换多少?
Certainly. How many miles would you like to transfer?

1179
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:32,140
周游世界要多少里程数?
How many miles does it take to circle the globe?

1180
01:38:32,230 --> 01:38:36,500
我们有周游世界的套票  每张需要50万英里
We have our round-the-world tickets. They're 500,000 miles each.

1181
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:38,230
- 好的  - 有时间吗?
- That'd be fine.  - Got a second?

1182
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:39,770
我过会儿打给你
I'll call you back.

1183
01:38:39,850 --> 01:38:42,420
你昨天干嘛去了?  我到处找你
What happened to you yesterday? I was trying to get hold of you.

1184
01:38:42,510 --> 01:38:46,340
处理些私事  怎么了?
I was some personal stuff. What's going on?

1185
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:48,870
你还记得Karen Barnes吗
Do you remember Karen Barnes,

1186
01:38:49,550 --> 01:38:52,730
几周前  在威奇托市辞掉的30个人之一?
part of a 30-person reduction a few weeks back in Wichita?

1187
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:57,880
- Natalie解雇了她  - 那天裁了很多人  我...
- Natalie fired her.  - Fired dozens of people a day. I...

1188
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:01,030
她自杀了...  从桥上跳了下去
She killed herself... jumped off a bridge.

1189
01:39:02,630 --> 01:39:04,060
我靠
Fuck.

1190
01:39:04,150 --> 01:39:08,470
我要知道  那位女士给过你什么暗示
I need to know if you remember any woman that gave you any signals,

1191
01:39:08,550 --> 01:39:11,680
- 沮丧...  - 他们都很沮丧  我们让解雇了他们
- depression...  - They're all depressed. We're firing them.

1192
01:39:11,770 --> 01:39:17,140
- 喂  我要弄清楚  明白?  - 不  我什么都不记得了
- Hey, I need to ask you this stuff, OK?  - No, I don't remember anything.

1193
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:20,690
你不会想他们...
You never think that they're...

1194
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:23,120
你不记得那个女的给过你暗示?
You don't remember any woman that gave you any signals?

1195
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:27,520
- 一点都没有  Ryan?  - 没有  没有什么异常
- Anything at all, Ryan?  - No, nothing stands out.

1196
01:39:30,130 --> 01:39:34,080
- Natalie正常吗?  - Natalie辞职了
- Is Natalie all right?  - Natalie quit.

1197
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:40,970
- 她辞职了?  - 通过短信
- She quit?  - Text message.

1198
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:45,090
不错啊  是吧?  一点礼仪都不讲
Fucking nice, right? No-one's got any manners any more.

1199
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:50,150
- 她说要去哪儿吗?  - 没有  就是看起来有些难过
- Did she say where she was going?  - No. She was a little upset.

1200
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:53,990
我应该给她打个电话
I should give her a call.

1201
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:59,770
我需要你回来  在空中工作
I need you back in the air.

1202
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:05,610
你听到我说的了吗?  我还以为你会很兴奋呢
Hey. Did you hear what I said? I thought you'd be thrilled about that.

1203
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:08,680
没事  那个视频裁人呢?
It's fine. What about the videoconferencing?

1204
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:14,880
付款中心要停止新媒体的投资  他们决定再考虑考虑
CTC is going to pause the new media front. They're gonna give it some more thought.

1205
01:40:14,970 --> 01:40:19,510
我们要召回我们的老黄牛来重操旧业  可以吗?
We are gonna get our workhorses back in the air doing what they do best, OK?

1206
01:40:20,710 --> 01:40:23,000
这次要派我出去多久?
How long are you sending me out?

1207
01:40:23,090 --> 01:40:28,230
你想去多久都行  到个地方  就给我们寄张明信片
We're gonna let you sail and sail. You send us a postcard if you ever get there.

1208
01:40:34,990 --> 01:40:38,230
旧金山

1209
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:44,510
发生什么了?
So what happened?

1210
01:40:45,490 --> 01:40:47,760
这么问什么意思?
How exactly do you mean?

1211
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:50,110
你是班上的尖子生
You graduated top of your class.

1212
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:52,880
你似乎都做好了职业规划  包括这里
You seemed to have your pick of employment, including here.

1213
01:40:52,970 --> 01:40:57,740
但是你却去了奥马哈  靠裁员为生?
Instead you went to Omaha to fire people for a living?

1214
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:02,000
- 这是一份有挑战性的工作  - 我也会这么说!
- It's challenging work.  - I'll say!

1215
01:41:02,090 --> 01:41:05,040
我无法想象做那种工作  日复一日
I can't imagine doing that, day in, day out.

1216
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:07,420
现在不景气
Not in this climate.

1217
01:41:08,910 --> 01:41:11,710
我为了一个男孩去的
I followed a boy.

1218
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:18,630
我想每个人  都会因为这样或那样的理由
I guess everybody does that at one point or another.

1219
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:26,490
这个人说  能雇到你是种幸运
This guy says I'd be lucky to have you.

1220
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:28,810
致相关人员
To whom it may concern.

1221
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:31,960
我一生中解雇的人不计其数
I can't even count the number of people I've fired in my lifetime.

1222
01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:35,660
以至于我都想不起雇人的感觉
So many that I've actually forgotten what it's like to hire somebody.

1223
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:40,760
我们未曾相识  但是你聘用Natalie Keener会是一种幸运
We've never met, but I know you'd be lucky to have Natalie Keener.

1224
01:41:40,850 --> 01:41:43,690
问我的建议?  聘用她  不要犹豫
My advice? Take her and don't look back.

1225
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:47,460
这会是你们的最好选择
She'll be the best decision you've made in a long time.

1226
01:41:51,070 --> 01:41:53,930
希望他是对的
I sure hope he's right.

1227
01:42:04,830 --> 01:42:06,760
嗯  我不抱期望
Well, I don't have a lot of hope,

1228
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:09,460
也不知道未来是否会好转
and I really don't know when it's gonna get better.

1229
01:42:09,550 --> 01:42:12,190
有很多人待业
There's a lot of people unemployed.

1230
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:17,470
真不知道什么时候才能看到曙光
And I really don't know when there's gonna be light at the end of the tunnel.

1231
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:19,220
我没什么好说的
I can't find much to talk about.

1232
01:42:19,310 --> 01:42:22,160
要说自豪  我为我的孩子感到自豪
Talk about being proud. I'm proud of my kids.

1233
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:27,370
我认为愤怒  因为不再被人需要
I think the anger comes from the fact that I just wasn't needed any more.

1234
01:42:27,450 --> 01:42:29,620
我想说  呃...
I would say, you know, uh...

1235
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:32,430
要不是朋友和家人的支持
without my friends and my family,

1236
01:42:32,510 --> 01:42:34,330
我无法坚持下来
I wouldn't have made it.

1237
01:42:34,410 --> 01:42:37,220
如果只有我一个人  我想那会举步维艰
It would have been a lot tougher if I'd had to make it on my own.

1238
01:42:37,310 --> 01:42:41,560
当我早上醒来  看到妻子
When I wake up in the morning and I look over and I see my wife,

1239
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:44,560
让我鼓起生活的勇气
that gives me the sense of purpose.

1240
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:47,530
那并不是钱的问题  钱能让你温暖
It's not all about the money. Money can keep you warm.

1241
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:51,970
为你付暖气费  为你买毛毯
It pays your heating bills. It can buy you a blanket.

1242
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:57,190
但是它远不及我丈夫的怀抱
But it doesn't keep you as warm as when my husband holds me.

1243
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:02,030
让我起床  让我出门  让我找活干
Let me get up. Let me get out. Let me find something.

1244
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:07,360
我的孩子和家人给了我决心
So my kids are my purpose. My family.

1245
01:43:36,030 --> 01:43:41,220
今夜人们回家  迎接他们的是欢呼雀跃的小狗和孩子们
Tonight most people will be welcomed home by jumping dogs and squealing kids.

1246
01:43:41,690 --> 01:43:46,050
他们的爱人会嘘寒问暖  然后安然入眠
Their spouses will ask about their day and tonight they'll sleep.

1247
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:51,290
斗转星移  夜幕低垂
The stars will wheel forth from their daytime hiding places.

1248
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:55,310
有一束光  格外耀眼

和对未来的焦虑

剧终
