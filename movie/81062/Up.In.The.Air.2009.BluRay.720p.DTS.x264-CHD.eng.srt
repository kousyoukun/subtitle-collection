1
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,940
This is what I get in return for 30 years of service for my company?

2
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,950
And they send some yo-yo like you in here,

3
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,460
to try to tell me that I'm out of a job?

4
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,800
They should be telling you you're out of a job.

5
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,810
You have a lot of gall, coming in here and firing your No.1 producer.

6
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,180
And then you're going to go home tomorrow and make more money than you've ever made in your life

7
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,540
and I'm going to go home without a pay cheque. Fuck you.

8
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,630
I just... I guess you leave me dumbfounded. I don't know where this is coming from.

9
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,020
How am I supposed to go back as a man and explain to my wife that I lost my job?

10
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:39,440
On a stress level, I've heard that losing your job is like a death in the family.

11
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,920
But personally, I feel more like

12
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,350
the people I worked with were my family and I died.

13
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,910
I can't afford to be unemployed.

14
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,780
I have a house payment, I have children.

15
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,170
I don't know how you can live with yourself,

16
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,710
but I'm sure that you'll find a way while the rest of us are suffering.

17
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,320
Who the fuck are you, man?

18
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,120
Excellent question. Who the fuck am I?

19
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,450
Poor Steve has worked here for seven years.

20
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,750
He's never had a meeting with me before or passed me in the hall,

21
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,970
or told me a story in the break room.

22
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,550
That's because I don't work here.

23
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,950
I work for another company that lends me out to pussies like Steve's boss

24
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,500
who don't have the balls to sack their own employees,

25
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,810
in some cases for good reason. Because people do crazy shit when they get fired.

26
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,060
Did I do something wrong?

27
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,470
I mean, is there something I could do differently here?

28
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,860
This is not an assessment of your productivity. Try not to take this personally.

29
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,890
Don't take it personally.

30
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,750
Steven, I want you to review this packet.

31
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,660
Take it seriously. I think you're gonna find a lot of good answers in here.

32
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,080
I'm sure this is gonna be very helpful. A packet.

33
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,750
Thank you... A packet.

34
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,790
Well, anybody who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you are right now.

35
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,160
And it's because they sat there they were able to do it.

36
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,400
That's the truth.

37
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,570
I'm gonna need your keycard.

38
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,910
Great. OK.

39
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,150
Now, I want you to take the day, go get together your personal things, then tomorrow

40
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,390
you get yourself some exercise. You go out for a jog,

41
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,770
you give yourself some routines and pretty soon you find your legs.

42
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,840
- How do I get in touch with you?  - Don't worry, we'll be in touch soon.

43
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,520
This is just the beginning.

44
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,720
I'll never see Steve again.

45
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,880
To know me is to fly with me. This is where I live.

46
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,950
When I run my card,

47
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,870
the system automatically prompts the desk clerk to greet me with this exact statement:

48
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,750
Pleasure to see you again, Mr Bingham.

49
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,280
It's these kinds of systemised friendly touches that keep my world in orbit.

50
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,750
All the things you probably hate about travelling

51
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,820
the recycled air, the artificial lighting, the digital juice dispensers,

52
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,640
the cheap sushi... are warm reminders that I'm home.

53
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,420
Do you want the cancer?

54
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,050
- The what?  - Do you want the cancer?

55
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,050
The cancer?

56
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,080
- The can... sir?  - Oh, no. I'm fine, thank you.

57
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,420
How much does your life weigh?

58
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,150
Imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack.

59
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,670
I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders. Feel 'em?

60
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,440
Now I want you to pack it with all the stuff that you have in your life.

61
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,290
Start with the little things,

62
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,720
the things on shelves and in drawers the knick-knacks, the collectibles.

63
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,140
Feel the weight as that adds up.

64
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:29,530
Then you start adding larger stuff... clothes, table-top appliances, lamps, linens...

65
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,720
your TV...

66
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,440
The backpack should be getting pretty heavy now. And you go bigger.

67
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,700
Your couch, bed, your kitchen table. Stuff it all in there.

68
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,840
Your car, get it in there.

69
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,330
Your home, whether it's a studio apartment or a two-bedroomed house.

70
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,540
I want you to stuff it all into that backpack.

71
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,130
Now try to walk.

72
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,930
It's kind of hard, isn't it?

73
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,090
This is what we do to ourselves on a daily basis.

74
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,990
We weigh ourselves down until we can't even move. And make no mistake...

75
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,950
moving is living.

76
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,340
Now, I'm gonna set that backpack on fire. What do you want to take out of it?

77
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,110
Photos?

78
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,870
Photos are for people who can't remember. Drink some ginkgo and let the photos burn.

79
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:24,630
In fact, let everything burn and imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing.

80
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,660
It's kind of exhilarating, isn't it?

81
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,990
Welcome back, Mr Bingham.

82
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,630
- Ryan Bingham's office.  - You have me in a Dodge Stratus in Kansas City.

83
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,280
- They were out of all full-size sedans.  - Did you try...

84
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,820
Yes, I reminded them of your remarkable No.1 Gold Club status in years in the program.

85
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,970
They are literally moving mountains to see you in a Sebring.

86
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,370
- Fair enough. Any other messages?  - Er... your sister Kara called.

87
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,890
Needs to speak urgently about your sister's wedding.

88
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,030
I told her you were mid-air, and not even I knew your destination.

89
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,990
- Well done.  - You got an invitation to speak at GoalQuest in Vegas.

90
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,080
GoalQuest 20?

91
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,970
Every once in a while, I do speaking engagements, motivational stuff. But GoalQuest?

92
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,470
We're talking major Tony Robbins shit.

93
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,150
It's got a hologram on it. They're calling it Dos Equis.

94
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,610
- All right, I'll check in.  - I've got Craig Gregory for you.

95
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,210
Wait... ah. Fuck.

96
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,260
How is my little road warrior?

97
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,140
Hey, 20 minutes from boarding into a world of bliss.

98
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,530
Real good numbers out of Phoenix, Ry guy.

99
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,250
You know that Big Auto is about to cut another 10K by the end of the month?

100
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,420
- No kidding.  - Christmas came early.

101
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,980
I wish you could be in five places, but I do need you here in Omaha this week. Alright?

102
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:56,530
- I thought you needed me everywhere.  - We got something real big, a real game changer.

103
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,030
What are we talking about here?

104
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:04,030
You'll see. Today I took my first crap in two weeks. Hallelujah.

105
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,620
- That's me hanging up on you.  - Great, love that sound.

106
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,670
Are you satisfied with Maestro?

107
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,240
Yeah, I am.

108
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,590
A little stingy with their miles. I like Hertz.

109
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:42,800
No, Hertz keeps its vehicles too long. If a car has over 20,000 miles, I won't drive it.

110
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,790
Maestro doesn't instant checkout. I like the park-and-go.

111
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,450
- Hertz doesn't guarantee navigation.  - You don't seem like a girl who needs directions.

112
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:55,160
I hate asking for directions. That's why I get a nav.

113
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:00,380
That new outfit, Colonial, isn't bad.

114
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,390
- Is that a joke?  - Yes.

115
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,880
- Their kiosk placement blows.  - They never have available upgrades.

116
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,900
Basically, it's a fleet of shit boxes. I don't know how they're still in business.

117
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,270
- I'm Ryan.  - I'm Alex.

118
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:22,060
Aww... Maplewood card. How dare you bring that into this palace?

119
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,060
Hilton offers equal value and better food but the Maplewood gives out warm cookies at check-in.

120
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,610
I'm a sucker for simulated hospitality.

121
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:35,970
There's an industry term for that. It's a mixture of faux and homey... faumey.

122
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,930
Oh, my God. I wasn't sure this actually existed.

123
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:45,120
- This is the American Airlines...  - It's a Concierge Key, yeah.

124
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,830
- What is that, carbon fibre?  - Graphite.

125
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,300
- Oh, I love the weight.  - I was pretty excited the day that bad boy came in.

126
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:01,740
I'll say. I put up pretty pedestrian numbers. 60 thousand a year, domestic.

127
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,330
- That's not bad.  - Don't patronise me.

128
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,750
- What's your total?  - It's a personal question.

129
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,350
- Please.  - And we hardly know each other.

130
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,660
Show some hubris. Come on, impress me.

131
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,560
- I bet it's huge.  - You have no idea.

132
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,980
How big?

133
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,320
- What is it, this big? This big?  - I don't want to brag.

134
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,380
Oh, come on! Come on.

135
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,350
Let's just say I have a number in mind. I haven't hit it yet.

136
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,040
- This is pretty fucking sexy.  - Hope it doesn't cheapen our relationship.

137
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,600
We're two people who get turned on by Elite Status. I think cheap is our starting point.

138
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,320
There's nothing cheap about loyalty.

139
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:51,660
So, we came up with this master plan, which was for me...

140
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,220
to put gauze, to put bandages on both my hands.

141
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:01,960
Then we got on the plane, transatlantic, flying to erm... Zurich.

142
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:06,700
I waited till it was dark, and I walked up to the bathroom with her.

143
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,510
Everybody was watching the movie and I was like...

144
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:15,040
Opened up, went inside. She opened the door for me, and came in like she was gonna help me.

145
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,150
We gave it our best shot. It wasn't great. But it was fun. It was tricky.

146
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,270
- Give me some details.  - It's not so easy. Have you tried it?

147
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,350
- It's not so easy.  - Yes, I have.

148
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,140
- Really?  - Really.

149
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,080
- You've done that?  - I have done that.

150
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:40,780
- On a transatlantic flight?  - On a domestic flight... regional, actually.

151
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,940
- At night-time?  - Daytime.

152
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,080
- What?  - How do you do that?

153
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,510
Oh, I'm really flexible.

154
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,120
Look. Ohh.

155
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,950
Ah, I should throw these out.

156
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,310
We can always use that room with the ice machine.

157
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,570
Look.

158
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,370
Good call on that towel rack.

159
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,800
I like how you burritoed me in the sofa cushions.

160
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,630
I was improvising.

161
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,250
Shame we didn't make it to the closet.

162
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,930
- We got to do this again.  - Oh, yeah.

163
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,750
I'm in Newark on the 12th, Modesto on the 13th...

164
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,990
Oklahoma City on the 15th...

165
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,580
Any Southwest? I'll be swinging by Albuquerque week of the 16th.

166
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,710
No, I'm in Florida on the 20th.  - Fort Lauderdale?

167
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,590
- Miami. 40 minutes.  - That's nothing.

168
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,410
I should probably go back to my room so I can wake up in my bed.

169
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,610
I think that would be the ladylike thing to do.

170
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:29,400
- Nice meeting you.  - A pleasure.

171
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,240
Hello?

172
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,910
Hey, Ryan, how you holding up?

173
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,550
Every family has one person who keeps the genealogy in check.

174
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,340
That's my sister Kara... the glue.

175
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,020
Fine. You and the kids?

176
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,810
Missy's outstanding, Matthew made varsity. How's the road?

177
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,910
Couldn't be better.

178
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,990
Good. So, Ryan?

179
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,410
Yeah?

180
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:28,520
I didn't even want to ask you this, because I know how you are about doing things for others.

181
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,910
But we're coming up on three weeks to go to Julie's wedding and something we could really use your help on it.

182
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,120
Yeah?

183
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,920
We've been sending people these kits,

184
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,670
so they can print out photos of Julie and Jim on cardboard,

185
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,000
and then take photos of them in interesting places, kinda like that gnome in the French movie.

186
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,790
Why?

187
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,500
Because it's Julie's wedding and she thinks it would be fun. Does it matter why?

188
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,700
How is Julie?

189
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,800
Would you call her. She thinks you've turned to butter.

190
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,830
- You're awfully isolated the way you live.  - Isolated? I'm surrounded.

191
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,260
So your assistant said you were gonna be in Vegas.

192
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,410
Did he?

193
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,340
Can you get a photo of the cut-out in front of the Luxor pyramid?

194
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,100
The place is a shithole. Nobody stays there.

195
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:11,360
Jesus, Ryan, I'm not asking you to check in. Can you just take a stupid photo?

196
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,060
I'll try my best.

197
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,770
Thank you for trying your best.

198
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,010
Last year, I spent 322 days on the road,

199
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,730
which means I had to spend 43 miserable days at home.

200
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,070
Hey, neighbour.

201
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,020
Hey, hi.

202
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:15,150
- I signed for this while you were gone.  - Oh, thanks.

203
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,090
- I hope it wasn't too much of a bother.  - Nah.

204
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,140
It's my sister. I haven't met the guy yet. They're getting married.

205
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,350
- Lots of luck.  - I know, right?

206
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:34,980
What are you doing tonight? You wanna come over later?

207
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,280
Um... I've started seeing somebody.

208
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,630
Oh. OK. Great.

209
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,570
Hey, it's good to see you.

210
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,400
- You too.  - It seems like it's been a while this time.

211
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,000
Ok.

212
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,960
I'm thrilled that everyone's back under one roof. Welcome home, boy's.

213
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:14,010
There's been a lot of whispering about why we're here, so let me jump right in.

214
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,610
Retailers are down 20%.

215
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,260
Auto industry is in the dump. Housing market doesn't have a heartbeat.

216
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:26,700
It is one of the worst times on record for America.

217
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:30,250
This is our moment.

218
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,560
Now, last summer, we received a dynamite young woman here from Cornell.

219
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,470
And she had some pretty big ideas that she challenged me with.

220
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,880
My first reaction was, "Who does this kid think she is?"

221
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,710
But after I gave it a listen, she really knocked me out. So...

222
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,610
With a peek into our future, Natalie Keener.

223
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,960
If there's one word I want to leave you with today, it's this.

224
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,710
Glocal?

225
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,760
Glocal.

226
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,080
Our global must become local.

227
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:11,720
This company keeps 23 people on the road at least 250 days a year.

228
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,770
It's expensive and it's inefficient.

229
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,320
When I came to Craig three months ago with this,

230
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:22,310
he told me, and quite astutely, it's only a problem if you have a solution.

231
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:26,020
Well, today I stand before you with just that.

232
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:31,460
You all know Ned in reception. Today I'm gonna fire Ned.

233
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,130
Sorry, Ned. I'm sure HR will hire you back this afternoon.

234
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,530
We'll see about that.

235
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,240
Ned could be any employee in any one of our clients' locations worldwide.

236
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
Strategy packets will be shipped in advance.

237
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,820
Ned will be given a seat and find one of our transition specialists waiting.

238
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,620
Mr Laskin,

239
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:54,460
we're having this conversation as your position is no longer available.

240
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,710
I don't understand. I'm fired?

241
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,000
Hearing the words"You've been let go" is never easy.

242
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,740
Change is scary, but consider the following:

243
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,450
anybody who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you are now.

244
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,940
And it's because they sat there that they were able to do it.

245
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,220
That's my fucking line.

246
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,230
But what happens now?

247
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,990
This is the first step of a process that ends with you in a new job that fulfils you.

248
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,540
Yeah, but how does it work?

249
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,620
Way to take the packet in front of you.

250
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,900
Review it... all the answers you're looking for are inside.

251
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,310
Start to fill out the necessary information and before you know it, you're on the way to new opportunities.

252
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,500
Ned, go back to your desk and start putting together your things.

253
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,500
As a favour to me, I'd appreciate it if you didn't spread the news just yet.

254
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,370
Panic doesn't help anyone.

255
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,010
I understand.

256
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,590
Give it up for Ned.

257
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,110
You can start the morning in Boston, stop in Dallas over lunch,

258
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:54,320
and finish the day in San Francisco. All for the price of a T1 line.

259
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,690
Our inflated travel budget is eviscerated by 85%.

260
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,480
And more importantly, to you guys on the road,

261
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:06,120
no more Christmases in a hotel in Tulsa, no more hours lost to weather delays.

262
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,390
You get to come home.

263
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,770
Tell me you're not taking this seriously.

264
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,990
That's why I brought the entire company in from the road,

265
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,610
because we're taking it seriously.

266
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,860
There is a methodology to what I do, there is a reason why it works.

267
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,640
Coke and IBM have been doing this for years, alright? You're familiar with them?

268
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:29,520
Like anything else, it'll take a few months of transition and everybody will settle in.

269
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,960
- Who are you taking off the road?  - How are you not getting this?

270
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,330
You are grouned. Everybody's grounded. It's done.

271
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,950
What we do here is brutal and it does leave people devastated.

272
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,510
But there is a dignity to the way I do it.

273
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,720
By stabbing them in the chest instead of the back, right?

274
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,150
- You wanted to see me?  - Well, uhm...

275
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,570
- You know what? Yeah, come on in. Come on in.  - Great job.

276
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,980
- Thank you. How's everyone taking it?  - Great.

277
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:59,780
Listen, I admire your... your zeal. And I think you have some very good ideas.

278
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,170
But you know nothing about the realities of my industry.

279
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,960
You can set up an iChat, but you don't know how people think.

280
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,600
- Actually I minored in psychology.  - Nice.

281
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,690
- OK, kiddo, fire me.  - Ryan...

282
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,790
If she's gonna do this regularly, don't you wanna know if she can fire somebody?

283
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,420
- She's fired Ned.  - My dog can fire Ned. Fire me.

284
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,330
- You don't need to do this.  - No, it's OK. I got this.

285
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,820
Mr Bingham,

286
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:31,140
I regret to inform you that your position at this company is no longer available.

287
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,240
Hm. Who the hell are you?

288
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,910
My name is Miss Keener. I'm here today to discuss your future.

289
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,490
My future? The only one who can fire me is Craig Gregory.

290
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,430
- Mr Craig Gregory hired me to handle this for him.  - Handle what? Handle me?

291
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,290
Mr. Gregory hired me, he's the only one who can fire me.

292
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,790
- You know what? I'm gonna go talk to him.  - Mr Bingham...

293
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:49,560
No, no. You can't follow me. You're on a computer screen, remember?

294
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,930
- Ryan...  - Let's try this again. Fire me again.

295
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,190
- I just did.  - Actually, you didn't. Fire me.

296
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,880
That's enough. I think we get it.

297
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:00,310
- Yeah?  - Mr Bingham, I'm here to inform you your position is no longer available.

298
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,580
- I'm fired?  - Yes, you're fired.

299
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,690
- Never say fired.  - You've been let go.

300
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,190
Why?

301
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,650
This is a mythical situation. How could I possibly know why?

302
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,970
Why doesn't matter, you never know why.

303
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:14,820
Don't focus on the why. Rather, spend your energy thinking about your future.

304
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,530
Well, I'm gonna spend my energy on suing you

305
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,290
unless you give me a good reason why you're firing me.

306
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,010
Mr. Bingham, the reason's not important.

307
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,830
You're firing me without grounds? Now I really have a lawsuit.

308
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,070
- I get what you're trying to say, Ryan.  - Don't take this personally, Mr. Bingham.

309
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,510
Personally?

310
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,410
This is the most personal situation you are ever gonna enter,

311
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,150
so before you try to revolutionise my business,

312
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,590
I'd like to know that you actually know my business.

313
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:50,740
That's a hell of a way to welcome her to the team.

314
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,030
Am I the only one that sees that by doing this we're making ourselves irrelevant?

315
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,610
No, frankly, we're making you irrelevant.

316
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,490
- Nice.  - Don't blame me.

317
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,900
Blame high fuel costs, blame insurance premiums, blame technology.

318
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,420
You're gonna watch yourself. You're a little too young to become a dinosaur.

319
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:09,120
- I'm not a dinosaur.  - I want you to show her the ropes.

320
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,420
What do I know what goes on here? Get Ferguson to do it.

321
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,990
I'm not talking about here.

322
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,550
- No.  - Yeah.

323
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,470
You're very confident this girl doesn't know what she's doing. So...

324
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:26,300
I'm sorry. I don't think a MySpace page qualifies you to rewire a company.

325
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:30,190
That's been great. Here's your chance. Go out, show her the magic, take her through the paces.

326
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:33,060
I'm not a fucking tour guide.

327
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:39,290
- Now here we go.  - Bingham, here's the boat,

328
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,420
and here's you. Do you want to be in the boat?

329
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,900
Yeah, alone.

330
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,810
We're ringing the bell, we're rounding everybody up.

331
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,620
You want to stay out a bit longer, you're welcome, but you will not be alone. Ok?

332
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,730
You let me know.

333
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,540
Oh, Christ.

334
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,380
- What?  - Follow me.

335
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:12,710
- I really like my luggage.  - That's exactly what it is... luggage.

336
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,690
Know how much time you lose checking in?

337
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:18,990
- I don't know. Five... ten minutes?  - 35 minutes a flight.

338
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:23,110
I travel 270 days a year. That's 157 hours.

339
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,610
That makes seven days. Are you willing to throw away an entire week on that?

340
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:39,570
You don't need this. Sorry, you don't need that.

341
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,650
You don't need that. They have neck pillows on the plane.

342
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:47,940
This... they have better ones there. I'll get rid of this.

343
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,910
I can just meet you at security.

344
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,240
Thank you.

345
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,140
Bingo. Asians.

346
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,950
- You can't be serious.  - Never get behind people with infants.

347
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,710
I've never seen a stroller collapse in less than 20 minutes.

348
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,870
Old people are worse. Their bodies are littered with hidden metal

349
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,900
and they never appreciate how little time they have left on earth.

350
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:16,860
Here we go. Five words: randomly selected for additional screening.

351
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,350
Asians, they pack light, travel efficiently,

352
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:22,900
and they've got a thing for slip-on shoes. Got a little.

353
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:27,070
- That's racist.  - I'm like my mother, I stereotype. It's faster.

354
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,360
Are you mad at your computer?

355
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:01,160
I type with purpose.

356
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:05,600
What is it that you're working on so furiously?

357
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,130
I'm building a workflow of firing techniques.

358
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:12,050
It's questions and responses, actions and reactions.

359
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,680
A script taking you through the steps of firing someone.

360
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,330
Who's it for?

361
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,570
Well, theoretically,

362
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,810
you could put it in the hands of anyone and they'd be downsizing immediately.

363
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:24,490
All you have to do is follow the steps.

364
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:28,060
Natalie, what is it you think we do here?

365
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:31,460
We prepare the newly-unemployed for the emotional and physical hurdles of job hunting,

366
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,130
while minimising legal blowback.

367
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,850
That's what we're selling. It's not what we're doing.

368
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:40,460
- OK, what are we doing?  - We are here to make limbo tolerable,

369
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:49,040
to ferry wounded souls across the river of dread until the point where hope is dimly visible.

370
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,670
Then stop the boat, shove 'em in the water and make 'em swim.

371
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,970
That's really impressive. Are you gonna put that in your book?

372
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,520
- I gotta grab this. I'll meet you at the car rental.  - Okay.

373
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,340
Hey, I was hoping I'd hear from you.

374
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,500
I'm in Hotlanta and I need a rib-joint recommend bad.

375
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:21,060
Fat Matt's. Bring a bib.

376
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,890
- You never called.  - I wasn't sure what was appropriate.

377
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,830
Appropriate? Right, I'm not some waitress you banged in a snowstorm.

378
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:32,310
That word has no place in our vocabulary.

379
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,080
I'm the woman that you don't have to worry about.

380
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:39,970
- Sounds like a trap.  - Listen...

381
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,760
the next time that you're worried about manners, don't.

382
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:48,370
If you wanna call, call. Just think of me as yourself, only with a vagina.

383
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,830
When am I gonna see you?

384
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:57,150
Well, I'm out of Hartsfield into IAD, with a connection in ORD into SDF.

385
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,630
Sorry.

386
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,680
Yeah, tell me about it.

387
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,830
How long's your layover? They got multiples into SDF. Could you push?

388
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,840
Yeah, I can push.

389
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:24,890
All you have to do today is watch and listen.

390
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:29,290
And when I talk about a strategy packet, hand them one of those.

391
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,650
Sounds great.

392
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,040
So although I wish I were here with better news,

393
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,090
the fact is that you and I are sitting here today because

394
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,660
this will be your last week of employment at this company.

395
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,710
- Why me?  - What am I supposed to do now?

396
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:47,010
Am I supposed to feel better I'm not the only one losing my job?

397
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:51,250
This is ridiculous! I have been a fine employee for over 10 years

398
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,950
and this is the way you treat me.

399
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:57,250
How do you sleep at night, man? How?

400
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,020
How's your family? They sleeping well at night?

401
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,190
Electricity still on?

402
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,910
Heat still on, refrigerator full of food?

403
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,320
Gas tank full of gas?

404
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,580
Going to Chuck E. Cheese this weekend or something?

405
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,720
Not me.

406
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,220
No, my kids, we're not gonna do anything.

407
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:23,130
What do you suggest I tell them?

408
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,700
Perhaps you're underestimating the positive effect

409
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:32,740
your career transition can have on your children.

410
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,860
The positive effect?

411
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:39,150
I make about 90 grand a year now.

412
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,460
Unemployment is what... 250 bucks a week?

413
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,860
Is that one of your positive effects?

414
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,540
We'll get to be cosier cos I'm not gonna be able to pay my mortgage on my house.

415
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:53,340
So maybe we can move into a nice fucking one-bedroom apartment somewhere.

416
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,690
And I guess without benefits,

417
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:00,690
I'll be able to hold my daughter as she, you know, suffers from her asthma

418
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,830
that I won't be able to afford the medication for.

419
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,750
Well... tests have shown that children under moderate trauma have a tendency to

420
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,660
apply themselves academically...

421
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,680
as a method of coping.

422
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,800
Go fuck yourself.

423
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,400
That's what my kids'll think.

424
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:24,760
- Your children's admiration is important to you?  - Yeah.

425
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,510
Yeah, it was.

426
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,810
Well, I doubt they ever admired you, Bob.

427
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,820
Hey, asshole, aren't you supposed to be consoling me?

428
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:36,800
I'm not a shrink, Bob. I'm a wake-up call.

429
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,660
- You know why kids love athletes?  - Cos they screw lingerie models?

430
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,920
No, that's why we love athletes. Kids love athletes

431
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,470
because they follow their dreams.

432
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,570
- Well, I can't dunk.  - No, but you can cook.

433
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,280
What are you talking about?

434
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,850
Your resume says that you minored in French culinary arts.

435
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,730
Most students, they work on the fryer at KFC,

436
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,160
but you bussed tables at Il Picador to support yourself.

437
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,970
Then you get out of college and then you come and work here.

438
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,610
How much did they first pay you to give up on your dreams?

439
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,250
- 27 grand a year.  - And when were you going to stop

440
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,940
and come back and do what makes you happy?

441
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,660
Good question.

442
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:26,550
I see guys who work at the same company for their entire lives,

443
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,590
guys exactly like you.

444
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:34,030
They clock in, they clock out, and they never have a moment of happiness.

445
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,410
You have an opportunity here, Bob.

446
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,820
This is a rebirth.

447
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:45,020
If not for you, do it for your children.

448
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,760
He just waltzes in and cuts in line?

449
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,640
We reserve priority assistance for our Hilton Honors members.

450
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:22,900
The promotions are great. You should check it out.

451
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,190
Hungry much?

452
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,870
Our business expense allots $40 each for dinner.

453
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,630
I plan on grabbing as many miles as I can.

454
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:40,320
OK, you gotta fill me in on the miles thing. What is that about?

455
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:43,760
Are you talking about... like frequent flyer miles?

456
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,450
- You really want to know?  - I'm dying to know.

457
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:52,680
I don't spend a nickel if I can help it unless it somehow profits my mileage account.

458
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:55,570
So what are you saving up for... Hawaii, South of France?

459
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:59,400
It's not like that. The miles are the goal.

460
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,250
That's it?

461
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,770
You're saving just to save?

462
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,630
Just say I have a number in mind and I haven't hit it yet.

463
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,060
That's a little abstract. What's the target?

464
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:13,650
- I'd rather not.  - Is it a secret target?

465
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,080
It's 10 million miles.

466
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,750
- OK. Isn't 10 million just a number?  - Pi's just a number.

467
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:23,080
Well, we all need a hobby.

468
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:28,670
No, I... I don't mean to belittle your collection. I get it. It sounds cool.

469
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,220
I'd be the seventh person to do it. More people have walked on the moon.

470
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,720
- Do they throw you a parade?  - You get lifetime executive status,

471
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,170
you get to meet the chief pilot, Maynard Finch...

472
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,770
And they put your name on a plane.

473
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,790
Men get hard-ons putting their name on stuff. You guys don't grow up.

474
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:46,610
- It's like you need to pee on everything.  - Now who's stereotyping?

475
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,850
Fear of mortality. It's like, yeah, you're gonna die one day.

476
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,220
Why do you suppose that's singular to men?

477
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:57,620
- Probably because you can't have babies.  - The baby argument.

478
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,520
If I had that many miles...

479
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,050
I would show up at an airport,

480
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:09,550
look at the destination board, pick a place and go.

481
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,360
Thanks for the advice.

482
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,280
Have sweet dreams about me.

483
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:33,150
OK. Closer. Way closer.

484
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,190
Still closer.

485
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,210
Closer.

486
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,800
Er... a little left.

487
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,990
Down a little.

488
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,890
Too far. Up. Up one more inch.

489
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,260
I don't get it. Why does your sister want a fake photo?

490
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:55,540
My sister is kooky. She thinks this is charming. It's like the Gnome Thing.

491
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,850
No, I mean, why would she want a fake photo in front of St Louis airport?

492
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:02,480
Are you kidding... Lambert Field? The Wright brothers flew through there.

493
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,720
That domed main terminal,

494
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:08,930
is the first of its kind, a precursor of everything from JFK to de Gaulle.

495
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:12,600
- Pretty sweet.  - Just take the picture.

496
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:17,320
Well, that's a keeper.

497
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,530
Let me see it.

498
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,380
Why she wants reminders of all the places she hasn't been is beyond me. But...

499
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,700
I'm sure she'll be crushed for having missed this airport.

500
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:31,050
Look, before Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic, he took off from one of those runways.

501
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,060
Do you ever wonder why they called it the Spirit of St Louis?

502
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:36,030
- No.  - Well...

503
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,120
Do you know how fucked this place is now?

504
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,430
I am the one thing... the one thing...

505
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:52,670
preventing this place from being totally fucked in the ass.

506
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,580
Sometimes they just need to vent.

507
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:07,530
Please, for the love of God, can I fire the next one?

508
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,720
- Miss Barnes, thank you for joining us.  - I'm here to be fired, right?

509
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,770
Well, we're here to talk about your future.

510
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,320
You don't have to sugar-coat it. I get the drill.

511
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:19,930
What are they offering?

512
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,620
Inside the packet, you'll find a clearly worked out severance package.

513
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,340
Give me the bullet points.

514
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:26,950
It's actually pretty good...

515
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,400
three months' pay, six months' medical.

516
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,480
And a full year of placement services through our company CTC.

517
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:36,550
Placement services. That's generous.

518
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:42,400
Commonly it takes a month of searching for every $10,000 you expect to earn in salary.

519
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:45,690
- So I could be looking for a while.  - Not necessarily.

520
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:49,910
Don't even sweat it. I'm pretty confident about my plans.

521
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,800
- Really?  - Yeah.

522
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:55,170
There's this beautiful bridge by my house.

523
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,590
I'm gonna go jump off it.

524
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,090
Natalie.

525
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,480
Hey!

526
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,700
Natalie!

527
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,440
People say these things all the time. It's part of the trade.

528
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,970
- They do?  - Yeah.

529
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:24,500
They say crazy things. They get worked up.

530
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:27,240
She was really calm.

531
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,720
I think that's a good sign.

532
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,610
- So they don't ever actually do it?  - No. No, it's just talk.

533
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:39,570
- How do you know? Do you follow up?  - I mean, no, nothing good's gonna come of that, but..

534
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,530
I wouldn't worry about it.

535
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:51,020
This is what we do, Natalie. We take people at their most fragile and we set them adrift.

536
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,420
Ready to go back in?

537
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:00,720
All right, let's go. Come on.

538
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:48,350
No, I'm fine. Tell me something sweet.

539
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:52,770
I'll be back soon. I'm not sure how long this exercise is supposed to last.

540
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:56,810
No, I don't even think of him that way. He's old.

541
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:40,120
- I... I'm done?  - I wasn't expecting this. Not at all.

542
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,210
Just like that?

543
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:45,080
I'm disappointed that I've given so much of my life...

544
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,220
This is not fair.

545
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:48,790
There are people who gonna be way more qualified than me now.

546
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,560
I don't know what to do when I wake up in the morning, tomorrow.

547
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:01,330
You OK?

548
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:05,770
- Are we going?  - Yeah.

549
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:26,280
This is how I start every day of my life.

550
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,280
Now, this is gonna be a little difficult, so stay with me.

551
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:33,300
You have a new backpack.

552
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:37,020
Only this time, I want you to fill it with people.

553
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:40,880
Start with casual acquaintances, friends of friends,

554
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,630
folks around the office.

555
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,100
And then the people you trust with your most intimate secrets...

556
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,620
your cousins, your aunts, your uncles,

557
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:52,450
your brothers, your sisters, your parents,

558
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:57,990
and finally your husband, your wife, your boyfriend or your girlfriend.

559
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,630
You get them into that backpack.

560
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:06,810
Don't worry. I'm not gonna ask you to light it on fire.

561
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:10,240
Feel the weight of that bag.

562
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:16,060
Make no mistake, your relationships are the heaviest components in your life.

563
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:21,240
Do you feel the straps cutting into your shoulders?

564
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:28,300
All those negotiations and arguments, and secrets and compromises.

565
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,590
You don't need to carry all that weight.

566
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,870
Why don't you set that bag down?

567
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:44,330
Some animals were meant to carry each other, to live symbiotically for a lifetime...

568
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:49,740
star-crossed lovers, monogamous swans. We are not those animals.

569
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,710
The slower we move, the faster we die.

570
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,490
We are not swans.

571
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,470
We're sharks.

572
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,740
- Never?  - No.

573
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,930
- Ever?  - No.

574
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:20,390
- You never want to get married?  - Nope.

575
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,520
- Never want kids?  - Not a chance.

576
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,280
- Ever?  - Never.

577
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:28,700
- Is that so bizarre?  - Yes.

578
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:33,060
- Yes, it is.  - I just don't see the value in it.

579
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:36,100
- Right, sell it to me.  - What?

580
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,450
Sell me marriage.

581
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:43,240
- OK, how about love?  - OK.

582
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:48,140
- Stability, just somebody you can count on...  - How many stable marriages do you know?

583
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:51,500
Somebody to talk to, someone to spend your life with.

584
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:55,290
I'm surrounded by people to talk to. I doubt that's not gonna change.

585
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,830
How about just not dying alone?

586
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:03,300
Starting when I was 12, we moved each of my grandparents to a nursing facility.

587
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:07,960
My parents went the same way. Make no mistake, we all die alone.

588
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,840
Now, those cult members in San Diego, with the Kool-Aid and the sneakers...

589
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,050
they didn't die alone.

590
00:48:15,145 --> 00:48:17,806
I'm just saying there are options.

591
00:48:20,577 --> 00:48:22,938
Oh, fuck.

592
00:48:23,569 --> 00:48:26,270
Brian left me.

593
00:48:32,191 --> 00:48:34,628
All right.

594
00:48:36,443 --> 00:48:39,320
OK. Ok. All right.

595
00:48:40,557 --> 00:48:43,898
All right. Shh, shh.

596
00:48:50,562 --> 00:48:50,704
Hey.

597
00:48:56,562 --> 00:49:00,704
Natalie, this is Alex, my friend. This is Natalie.

598
00:49:01,157 --> 00:49:03,461
I should give you both a moment.

599
00:49:03,547 --> 00:49:08,864
No. No, that's fine. I'm fine. It's a pleasure to meet you.

600
00:49:09,161 --> 00:49:13,308
Maybe we should just all go up to our rooms and freshen up.

601
00:49:13,394 --> 00:49:15,778
- Maybe a drink?  - Now you're talking.

602
00:49:15,864 --> 00:49:18,598
Brian: I think it's time we C other people

603
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:21,576
He broke up with you with a text message?

604
00:49:21,662 --> 00:49:25,128
Kind of like firing someone over the internet.

605
00:49:26,635 --> 00:49:30,204
- What a weaselly prick.  - But what does that make me?

606
00:49:30,327 --> 00:49:32,725
- Someone who falls for a prick.  - We all fall for them.

607
00:49:32,811 --> 00:49:35,620
Pricks are spontaneous, unpredictable and fun.

608
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:38,698
Then we're surprised when they turn out to be pricks.

609
00:49:39,069 --> 00:49:43,150
- I followed him to Omaha.  - You did?

610
00:49:43,323 --> 00:49:47,868
I had a job waiting for me in San Francisco when he got an offer from ConAgra.

611
00:49:48,647 --> 00:49:51,404
He said we could start a life together.

612
00:49:51,963 --> 00:49:55,728
- So I followed him.  - To Nebraska?

613
00:49:57,837 --> 00:50:01,074
I thought I'd be engaged by now.

614
00:50:01,315 --> 00:50:02,766
No offence.

615
00:50:02,852 --> 00:50:05,096
- None taken.  - That's all right.

616
00:50:06,348 --> 00:50:09,894
When I was 16, I thought by 23 I'd be married,

617
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:14,609
maybe have a kid, corner office by day, entertaining at night.

618
00:50:14,695 --> 00:50:16,866
I was supposed to be driving a Grand Cherokee by now.

619
00:50:16,952 --> 00:50:20,009
Life can underwhelm you that way.

620
00:50:20,095 --> 00:50:23,396
I mean, where did you think you'd be by um...

621
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:29,514
- It doesn't work that way.  - At a certain point, you stop with the deadlines.

622
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,061
It can be counterproductive.

623
00:50:31,147 --> 00:50:33,128
I don't want to say anything anti-feminist.

624
00:50:33,214 --> 00:50:36,561
I really appreciate all your generation did for me.

625
00:50:36,647 --> 00:50:38,454
- It was our pleasure.  - Well done.

626
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:41,366
But sometimes it feels like, no matter how much success I have,

627
00:50:41,452 --> 00:50:44,464
it's not gonna matter until I find the right guy.

628
00:50:45,021 --> 00:50:47,657
You really thought this guy was the one?

629
00:50:47,743 --> 00:50:50,106
I could have made it work.

630
00:50:50,192 --> 00:50:53,254
He um... he really fit the bill.

631
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,630
- You know?  - The bill?

632
00:50:55,716 --> 00:50:58,199
White collar, college grad.

633
00:50:58,285 --> 00:51:02,390
Loves dogs, likes funny movies. Six-foot-one, brown hair, kind eyes,

634
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:07,984
works in finance but is outdoorsy... you know, on the weekends.

635
00:51:08,271 --> 00:51:14,172
I always imagined he'd have a single syllable name like Matt or John...

636
00:51:14,257 --> 00:51:16,222
or Dave.

637
00:51:16,383 --> 00:51:19,262
In a perfect world, he drives a 4Runner, and

638
00:51:19,348 --> 00:51:22,348
and the only thing he loves more than me is his golden lab.

639
00:51:22,888 --> 00:51:25,662
And a nice smile.

640
00:51:27,867 --> 00:51:31,904
- What about you?  - Let me think.

641
00:51:33,397 --> 00:51:38,205
Honestly, by the time you're 34, all the physical requirements just go out the window.

642
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:42,044
Like you secretly pray that he'll be taller than you.

643
00:51:42,943 --> 00:51:47,400
Not an asshole would be nice. Someone who enjoys my company, comes from a good family.

644
00:51:47,486 --> 00:51:49,612
You don't think about that when you're younger.

645
00:51:49,698 --> 00:51:53,818
I don't know... someone who wants kids.

646
00:51:53,904 --> 00:51:56,919
Likes kids. Wants kids

647
00:51:57,005 --> 00:52:00,962
Healthy enough to play with his kids.

648
00:52:02,757 --> 00:52:06,113
Please let him earn more money than I do.

649
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:09,274
You might not understand that now, but believe me, you will one day.

650
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,530
Otherwise that's a recipe for disaster.

651
00:52:13,981 --> 00:52:16,603
And hopefully some hair on his head.

652
00:52:16,689 --> 00:52:20,504
But I mean even that's not a deal breaker these days.

653
00:52:23,663 --> 00:52:26,010
A nice smile.

654
00:52:27,301 --> 00:52:31,418
Yeah, a nice smile. Nice smile just might do it.

655
00:52:33,739 --> 00:52:36,134
Wow, that was depressing.

656
00:52:37,385 --> 00:52:40,624
- I should just date women.  - Tried it.

657
00:52:40,801 --> 00:52:43,438
We're no picnic ourselves.

658
00:52:46,313 --> 00:52:49,464
I don't mind being married to my career.

659
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:53,388
And I don't expect it to hold me in bed as I fall asleep.

660
00:52:57,439 --> 00:53:00,207
I just don't want to settle.

661
00:53:00,293 --> 00:53:04,266
You're young. Right now you see settling as some sort of a failure.

662
00:53:04,352 --> 00:53:08,095
It is... by definition.

663
00:53:08,181 --> 00:53:12,147
But by the time someone is right for you, it won't feel like settling.

664
00:53:12,233 --> 00:53:13,744
And the only person left to judge you

665
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:17,354
will be the 23-year-old girl with a target on your back.

666
00:53:20,996 --> 00:53:23,706
So what's the plan for the evening?

667
00:53:24,029 --> 00:53:28,400
Well, we were gonna hit that party for the tech conference at the hotel.

668
00:53:28,486 --> 00:53:32,206
I didn't know you could just attend those. I thought you had to register.

669
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:35,070
Technically, I don't think it's open to the public.

670
00:53:35,156 --> 00:53:39,582
- Stop by.  - You're gonna crash it?

671
00:53:42,538 --> 00:53:47,809
- have a good time, usually. - No, no, I get it. I'm in.

672
00:54:07,507 --> 00:54:09,811
Jennifer Chu?

673
00:54:09,897 --> 00:54:12,931
- Shit!  - Ah, it'll be fine.

674
00:54:34,493 --> 00:54:36,991
Doing all right?

675
00:54:37,956 --> 00:54:41,073
Yeah. This was a great idea.

676
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:44,765
You're so pretty.

677
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:48,670
You're exactly what I wanna look like in 15 years.

678
00:54:48,945 --> 00:54:52,555
- Thank you, Natalie.  - You should dance.

679
00:54:56,033 --> 00:54:57,168
- Come on.  - No, no, no.

680
00:54:57,254 --> 00:55:00,002
- Come on.  - Oh!

681
00:55:16,403 --> 00:55:19,856
- I'm Dave.  - I'm Natalie.

682
00:55:20,043 --> 00:55:22,424
Who's Jennifer?

683
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,798
I don't know.

684
00:55:26,168 --> 00:55:29,285
How's everybody doing out there?

685
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:34,342
Right about now, give it up for a very special alphaTECH guest.

686
00:55:34,428 --> 00:55:38,112
Young MC!

687
00:55:38,628 --> 00:55:40,742
What's up, alphaTECH?

688
00:55:40,828 --> 00:55:44,874
I got a busted computer. Can somebody fix it for me?

689
00:56:32,454 --> 00:56:37,131
I want you to have a key to my place.

690
00:56:38,038 --> 00:56:42,513
Wow. I had no idea we were at that point in our relationship.

691
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,435
- Oh, yes.  - Wow.

692
00:56:49,164 --> 00:56:51,377
Where is she?

693
00:56:51,748 --> 00:56:57,748
# Lyin' in my bed I hear the clock tick and think of you #

694
00:56:57,748 --> 00:57:05,043
# Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new #

695
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:12,543
# Flash back Warm night Almost left behind #

696
00:57:12,988 --> 00:57:16,743
# Suitcase Memories Time after some time # 

697
00:57:25,988 --> 00:57:28,743
Back home I don't get to act the way I do with you.

698
00:57:28,829 --> 00:57:32,791
- That's why I don't have a back home.  - I know.

699
00:57:33,172 --> 00:57:37,943
You're so cool. Mr Empty Backpack.

700
00:57:38,402 --> 00:57:40,483
- You know about my backpack?  - I Googled you.

701
00:57:40,569 --> 00:57:41,609
You did?

702
00:57:41,695 --> 00:57:45,265
It's what us modern girls do when we have a crush.

703
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:48,013
- Does it bother you?  - It depends.

704
00:57:48,099 --> 00:57:52,891
Is the bag empty because you hate people or because you hate the baggage they come along with?

705
00:57:52,977 --> 00:57:55,479
I don't hate people. I'm not exactly a hermit.

706
00:57:55,565 --> 00:58:00,257
You just don't want to be tied down with the whole responsibility thing.

707
00:58:00,604 --> 00:58:03,568
I don't know what originally sparked the backpack.

708
00:58:03,654 --> 00:58:06,559
Probably needed to be alone.

709
00:58:07,074 --> 00:58:11,667
Recently, I've been thinking that I needed to empty the backpack

710
00:58:11,753 --> 00:58:14,775
before I know what to put back in it.

711
00:58:33,138 --> 00:58:37,194
- Oh, no!  - I think we're out of gas.

712
00:59:16,812 --> 00:59:19,490
Hey. You're up?

713
00:59:19,576 --> 00:59:23,365
I have to fly standby and make a meeting in Cincinnati.

714
00:59:25,536 --> 00:59:25,666
OK.

715
00:59:27,536 --> 00:59:30,066
I made you feel cheap.

716
00:59:30,152 --> 00:59:34,084
It's all right. Just leave the money on the dresser.

717
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:38,211
I'll text you later so we can swap schedules.

718
00:59:41,006 --> 00:59:41,283
Hey.

719
00:59:44,006 --> 00:59:46,583
I really like you.

720
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:51,219
- I like you too.  - Good.

721
00:59:52,446 --> 00:59:55,359
Go catch your plane.

722
01:00:07,198 --> 01:00:09,024
Last night er...

723
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:13,268
It was kind of out of hand. I said things, erm...

724
01:00:14,014 --> 01:00:16,660
I'm not actually sure everything that I said.

725
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:19,972
- But I didn't want you to think...  - Just relax.

726
01:00:20,058 --> 01:00:22,791
It was nice to see you cut loose.

727
01:00:23,104 --> 01:00:25,765
Did you wake him up or slip out?

728
01:00:27,042 --> 01:00:29,972
- What?  - This morning. Your new friend.

729
01:00:30,058 --> 01:00:31,911
Did you wake him up for an awkward goodbye, or did you

730
01:00:31,997 --> 01:00:35,535
just slip out and make him feel like a whore?

731
01:00:36,658 --> 01:00:40,559
- I just left.  - Protocol's always tricky.

732
01:00:43,016 --> 01:00:44,620
What happened to Alex?

733
01:00:44,706 --> 01:00:46,814
She had to leave town early to get to a meeting.

734
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:50,995
- That's too bad. Where's she live?  - Chicago.

735
01:00:51,438 --> 01:00:52,950
Thinking of going to see her?

736
01:00:53,036 --> 01:00:57,143
We don't really have that kind of relationship. Try it over there.

737
01:00:57,296 --> 01:01:01,007
What erm... kind of relationship do you have?

738
01:01:01,093 --> 01:01:04,358
Well, you know... casual.

739
01:01:04,444 --> 01:01:08,693
- Sounds pretty special.  - It works for us.

740
01:01:09,498 --> 01:01:11,614
Don't you think there's a future there?

741
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,207
I never really thought about it. What's going on here?

742
01:01:14,293 --> 01:01:17,217
- Really never thought about it?  - No.

743
01:01:18,854 --> 01:01:20,475
How can you not think about that?

744
01:01:20,561 --> 01:01:24,260
How does it not even cross your mind that you might want a future with someone?

745
01:01:24,346 --> 01:01:27,890
It's simple. You know that moment when you look into somebody's eyes and you can 

746
01:01:28,007 --> 01:01:33,039
feel them staring into your soul and the whole world goes quiet just for a second?

747
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:36,449
- Yes.  - Right. Well, I don't.

748
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:38,322
You're an asshole.

749
01:01:38,408 --> 01:01:40,841
You know, look, I'm just dicking around. Come on, give me a hand. 

750
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:42,641
Dont't you think it's worth giving her a chance?

751
01:01:42,727 --> 01:01:45,200
- A chance for what?  - A chance at something real.

752
01:01:45,286 --> 01:01:48,165
Natalie, your definition of real will evolve as you get older.

753
01:01:48,251 --> 01:01:52,679
Can you stop condescending for one second or is that one of the principles of your bullshit philosophy?

754
01:01:52,765 --> 01:01:55,593
- Bullshit philosophy?  - The isolation, the travelling.

755
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:58,187
- Is that supposed to be charming?  - No, simply a life choice.

756
01:01:58,273 --> 01:02:01,511
- It's a cocoon of self-banishment.  - Wow. Big words.

757
01:02:01,597 --> 01:02:05,120
- Screw you.  - Screw you, too.

758
01:02:05,206 --> 01:02:06,069
You have set up a way of life that basically 

759
01:02:06,506 --> 01:02:09,469
makes it impossible for you to have any kind of human connection.

760
01:02:09,555 --> 01:02:13,457
And now this woman comes along and somehow runs the gauntlet of your ridiculous 

761
01:02:13,643 --> 01:02:17,692
life choice, and comes out on the other end smiling just so you can call her "casual"?

762
01:02:17,778 --> 01:02:21,522
I need to grow up? You're a 12-year-old.

763
01:02:21,608 --> 01:02:24,418
I don't have a gauntlet...

764
01:02:26,674 --> 01:02:28,887
Fuck.

765
01:03:09,091 --> 01:03:12,934
Listen, these Detroit guys can be tough. They're getting hammered.

766
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,132
So you don't get distracted. Stick with the simple stuff.

767
01:03:15,218 --> 01:03:19,526
Get these packets in their hands and get them out the door, OK?

768
01:03:32,229 --> 01:03:34,616
Hey, welcome to Detroit.

769
01:03:34,702 --> 01:03:36,464
What's going on here?

770
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:38,545
I've been looking at those great numbers on last few days. 

771
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:40,545
I thought maybe we should just nut up and give this a try.

772
01:03:40,631 --> 01:03:42,128
We use a little more time.

773
01:03:42,214 --> 01:03:44,929
Well, you gotta leave the nest at some point, huh?

774
01:03:45,015 --> 01:03:47,812
This is a real company, Craig. We're here to do some damage.

775
01:03:47,898 --> 01:03:51,594
I know. It's a good thing we brought our best, okay? Let's stop screwing around.

776
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,778
Just give me a minute to prepare and get my things together.

777
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:57,632
I was thinking Natalie was gonna take this one.

778
01:03:58,364 --> 01:03:59,824
She's hardly ready for that.

779
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:01,924
I've been watched her results the last few days. She's great.

780
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:03,652
This is a whole other animal.

781
01:04:03,738 --> 01:04:08,628
You know, she created it and everything right? Natalie, are you nut up for it?

782
01:04:09,943 --> 01:04:11,254
Yeah, I'm game.

783
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:13,672
That's my girl.

784
01:04:14,386 --> 01:04:18,000
Just remember, don't apologize or tell them how hard this is for you.

785
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:20,101
Today's one of the worst days they're ever gonna have in their life. 

786
01:04:20,211 --> 01:04:23,181
How we feel doesn't even compare.

787
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:28,657
- Got it.  - Just keep it professional. You'll be fine.

788
01:04:32,228 --> 01:04:33,703
What's all this? What's going on?

789
01:04:33,789 --> 01:04:35,641
Hello, Mr Samuels.

790
01:04:35,727 --> 01:04:38,837
I wish I were here with better news.

791
01:04:39,088 --> 01:04:43,187
However, your position here at Wall Timer's is no longer available.

792
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,259
What are you talking about?

793
01:04:46,854 --> 01:04:49,241
You've been let go.

794
01:04:49,327 --> 01:04:51,709
Just like that?

795
01:04:53,082 --> 01:04:55,255
Who are you?

796
01:04:56,006 --> 01:05:00,500
My name is Miss Keener and I'm here today to talk about your options.

797
01:05:00,586 --> 01:05:06,759
I worked for this company for 17 years and they send a 4th-grader to can me?

798
01:05:07,117 --> 01:05:10,257
What the fuck is this?

799
01:05:18,588 --> 01:05:21,318
It's perfectly normal to be upset.

800
01:05:21,404 --> 01:05:24,841
However, the sooner you can tell yourself the greater opportunities are waiting for you. 

801
01:05:24,927 --> 01:05:29,211
Greater opportunities? I'm 57 fucking years old.

802
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:36,041
Anybody who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you are now.

803
01:05:37,368 --> 01:05:40,905
And it's because they sat there that they were able to do it.

804
01:05:45,388 --> 01:05:50,225
There's a packet in front of you. I want you to take some time and review it.

805
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:54,985
All the answers you're looking for are inside those pages.

806
01:05:58,224 --> 01:06:00,435
The sooner you trust the process, 

807
01:06:00,484 --> 01:06:03,635
the sooner the next step of your life will unveil itself.

808
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:15,525
I need you to go back to your office now and start putting together your personal things.

809
01:06:33,671 --> 01:06:37,382
Mr Samuels, that's all we can discuss now.

810
01:06:41,012 --> 01:06:43,469
Mr Samuels.

811
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:54,005
Mr Samuels.

812
01:06:57,310 --> 01:06:59,903
Mr Samuels!

813
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:17,129
You did good.

814
01:07:18,949 --> 01:07:21,620
You oK? You want me to take over?

815
01:07:21,706 --> 01:07:24,007
No, I'm all right.

816
01:07:39,274 --> 01:07:44,607
Look, we just got here. That's one place. I think we need to try a few more.

817
01:07:45,708 --> 01:07:46,000
Maybe it doesn't make difference, 

818
01:07:46,009 --> 01:07:48,882
but it's comforting to know that we're in the next room.

819
01:07:48,968 --> 01:07:52,233
I know you don't give a shit about my comfort.

820
01:07:52,365 --> 01:07:56,291
I think we could try a few more, that's all I'm saying.

821
01:07:59,666 --> 01:08:01,553
Fine.

822
01:08:04,006 --> 01:08:07,885
All right. OK. All right.

823
01:08:13,252 --> 01:08:16,470
He thought you did a great job. You did.

824
01:08:16,556 --> 01:08:20,855
- I'm real proud of you.  - Thanks.

825
01:08:22,671 --> 01:08:25,546
They're pulling us off the road.

826
01:08:26,591 --> 01:08:28,545
We're going home.

827
01:08:28,631 --> 01:08:34,121
- Really? For good?  - Yeah.

828
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:38,337
Good job.

829
01:09:03,419 --> 01:09:06,613
I'm sorry about what I said about Alex. That was out of line.

830
01:09:06,699 --> 01:09:08,870
It's all right. I understand.

831
01:09:08,956 --> 01:09:12,388
I mean, who am I to be doling out relationship advice, right?

832
01:09:12,474 --> 01:09:14,981
No kidding.

833
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:21,002
Are you gonna be oK?

834
01:09:21,088 --> 01:09:24,718
- What do you mean?  - In Omaha?

835
01:09:26,902 --> 01:09:29,227
I don't know.

836
01:09:30,108 --> 01:09:32,723
It's better than you'd think.

837
01:09:41,895 --> 01:09:43,251
Ryan.

838
01:09:43,337 --> 01:09:47,559
- Ryan. Where are you going?  - I'm grabbing another flight.

839
01:09:47,645 --> 01:09:51,983
Something I've got to take care of. I'll see you back at home.

840
01:10:09,674 --> 01:10:12,934
OK, just walk it in a little.

841
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:14,988
A little more.

842
01:10:15,074 --> 01:10:18,787
There you go. Yeah.

843
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,291
Got it.

844
01:10:25,909 --> 01:10:28,022
They're a cute couple.

845
01:10:28,108 --> 01:10:31,361
- You think so?  - Yeah, they'll make cute kids.

846
01:10:32,483 --> 01:10:36,071
How do you like Wisconsin in February?

847
01:10:36,157 --> 01:10:40,327
I like it if you're there. I know a killer burger in Milwaukee.

848
01:10:40,413 --> 01:10:42,218
Northern Wisconsin.

849
01:10:44,246 --> 01:10:46,735
What are you doing this weekend?

850
01:10:47,629 --> 01:10:49,305
- No.  - What, I haven't...

851
01:10:49,391 --> 01:10:53,633
- You want me to be your date?  - Yeah. Yeah.

852
01:10:53,719 --> 01:10:57,243
- At your sister's wedding?  - It's not like I know her that well.

853
01:10:57,851 --> 01:11:01,270
Look, I'm not the wedding type, right?

854
01:11:01,356 --> 01:11:03,999
But for the first time in my life I don't want to be that guy alone at a bar.

855
01:11:04,085 --> 01:11:06,761
I want a dance partner, I want a "plus one".

856
01:11:06,847 --> 01:11:10,876
And if you can stomach it, I'd like it to be you.

857
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:37,987
Excuse me. Are you available?

858
01:11:38,073 --> 01:11:42,166
This line's for members of our Matterhorn Programme.

859
01:11:47,151 --> 01:11:49,660
Hey... Ryan.

860
01:11:50,138 --> 01:11:54,497
- Hey.  - Kara. Hi.

861
01:11:55,133 --> 01:11:57,083
- Alex, this is my sister Kara.  - Hi.

862
01:11:57,169 --> 01:11:59,732
Well, hello.

863
01:11:59,818 --> 01:12:03,817
Ryan's told me nothing about you.

864
01:12:04,156 --> 01:12:07,079
So you two are dating?

865
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:11,395
- Not exactly.  - Well, hey, don't worry about it.

866
01:12:11,481 --> 01:12:14,459
We're all getting a little old to be calling someone girlfriend.

867
01:12:14,545 --> 01:12:17,844
I remember when mom used to call Jack her boyfriend. God.

868
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:22,157
Drove me up the wall. Boyfriends are for kids, right?

869
01:12:22,584 --> 01:12:25,085
So what are you doing at the hotel?

870
01:12:25,171 --> 01:12:30,644
Yeah, oK, er... Frank and I are trying out a trial separation.

871
01:12:30,730 --> 01:12:34,825
- I'm sorry. So you're not staying at the house?  - No, there was a room on hold here,

872
01:12:34,911 --> 01:12:38,188
so I thought I'd just take it for the weekend.

873
01:12:40,112 --> 01:12:44,591
- So the rehearsal dinner?  - Oh, yeah, tonight. I'll see you two there.

874
01:12:47,869 --> 01:12:50,218
Nice digs.

875
01:12:52,532 --> 01:12:55,025
There's a packet.

876
01:13:00,392 --> 01:13:02,137
Hey, look who's here.

877
01:13:02,223 --> 01:13:07,399
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Ryan!  - Hey.

878
01:13:11,026 --> 01:13:14,329
- Oh, you must be Alex.  - Yes, I am. Hi. How are you?

879
01:13:14,415 --> 01:13:18,573
You are so beautiful. Kara was right.

880
01:13:19,656 --> 01:13:23,723
Gosh. You look so grown-up.

881
01:13:23,809 --> 01:13:26,347
I do? You're the one that's getting married.

882
01:13:26,433 --> 01:13:28,937
Oh, I know, right?

883
01:13:29,533 --> 01:13:32,830
Oh. You haven't even seen my ring.

884
01:13:33,001 --> 01:13:34,757
- Oh, look at that.  - Oh, it's lovely.

885
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:37,201
Jim designed it.

886
01:13:37,412 --> 01:13:39,817
Hey, Jim.

887
01:13:41,077 --> 01:13:43,303
- Hey.  - How's it going?

888
01:13:43,389 --> 01:13:45,957
- Hey. I'm Ryan.  - Jim. Good to meet you.

889
01:13:46,043 --> 01:13:46,962
- Alex.  - Pleasure.

890
01:13:47,043 --> 01:13:47,962
Pleasure.  

891
01:13:49,061 --> 01:13:51,458
Thank you, guys, for coming.

892
01:13:51,779 --> 01:13:54,043
Brother!  

893
01:13:55,002 --> 01:13:58,339
- It's true, though.  - Yeah, it's crazy.

894
01:13:59,066 --> 01:14:03,884
- I got the pictures you asked me to get.  - You can just put them right there.

895
01:14:05,661 --> 01:14:08,302
Yeah, oK.

896
01:14:36,621 --> 01:14:38,609
You got so many up there, I almost didn't have room.

897
01:14:38,695 --> 01:14:42,665
I know. It's so great, everyone just chipped in.

898
01:14:42,883 --> 01:14:46,005
What gave you the idea to do something so...

899
01:14:46,091 --> 01:14:48,828
- Substantial.  - Well... 

900
01:14:48,973 --> 01:14:52,968
Jim has a lot of our nest egg invested in this real estate venture.

901
01:14:53,054 --> 01:14:55,917
Mm-hm. It's a real estate investment.

902
01:14:56,003 --> 01:14:58,870
It's exciting, but we went over our finances and...

903
01:14:58,956 --> 01:15:00,823
A honeymoon just called, at this state in the game, 

904
01:15:01,056 --> 01:15:03,123
just doesn't really seem affordable.

905
01:15:03,209 --> 01:15:05,198
So, you know, we just thought,

906
01:15:05,284 --> 01:15:08,920
just because we can't travel doesn't mean we can't have pictures.

907
01:15:09,006 --> 01:15:11,566
- I think that's a fabulous idea.  - Yeah, it's a good one.

908
01:15:11,652 --> 01:15:14,766
I mean the concept is turnkey everything.

909
01:15:14,852 --> 01:15:17,106
Ok, you buy a maintenance contract when you get the home. You know, 

910
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:19,842
we'll whack your weeds, we'll change your light bulbs, furniture, 

911
01:15:20,092 --> 01:15:22,942
you can bring your own or pick one of our beautiful packages.

912
01:15:23,028 --> 01:15:26,868
- Seamless traditionalism, yet all the perks.  - Nice.

913
01:15:26,954 --> 01:15:32,489
We all need a place to call our own. This is America. This is who we were promised.

914
01:15:32,787 --> 01:15:36,216
- It's a nice touch  - What?

915
01:15:36,342 --> 01:15:38,432
The bit at the end about the promise. I like that part.

916
01:15:38,518 --> 01:15:41,580
Oh, thanks.

917
01:15:42,639 --> 01:15:48,086
- You er...you still renting that one-bedroom?  - No. I gave it up.

918
01:15:48,172 --> 01:15:50,916
- So you own now?  - No.

919
01:15:51,002 --> 01:15:53,061
But you're looking?

920
01:15:53,147 --> 01:15:55,896
No, not really.

921
01:15:56,143 --> 01:15:58,318
So you're just good?

922
01:15:58,653 --> 01:16:01,796
- I'm good.  - Well, that's good.

923
01:16:01,882 --> 01:16:05,750
Can you believe it's tomorrow? How are you gonna sleep?

924
01:16:05,836 --> 01:16:07,832
I don't know.

925
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:11,352
- Well, do you want some Xanax?  - I don't think that's for sleeping.

926
01:16:11,438 --> 01:16:15,020
Yeah. No, I think I'll just have a glass of warm milk.

927
01:16:15,106 --> 01:16:18,912
- That'll do the trick.  - OK. See you tomorrow.

928
01:16:20,257 --> 01:16:22,927
There's another box inside.

929
01:16:23,013 --> 01:16:24,583
- I'll grab it.  - You sure?

930
01:16:24,669 --> 01:16:27,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

931
01:16:35,493 --> 01:16:38,842
- Jim seems like a good guy.  - Yeah, isn't he great?

932
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:41,938
He's gonna make a great husband.

933
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:49,146
You know, Julie, I was thinking, you know, with dad not being here, erm...

934
01:16:49,463 --> 01:16:53,332
I was wondering if you had anybody to walk you down the aisle.

935
01:16:58,251 --> 01:17:02,922
- No, Jim's uncle is gonna do it.  - He's been really supportive.

936
01:17:03,008 --> 01:17:04,644
He's been great.

937
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:08,758
Well, good. That's great. I just wanted to make sure that you...

938
01:17:09,089 --> 01:17:12,342
I wanted you to be covered, that's all.

939
01:17:15,037 --> 01:17:17,300
So, I should be there, what?

940
01:17:17,386 --> 01:17:23,460
The other guests are arriving around five and things get going at five-thirty so...

941
01:17:23,546 --> 01:17:26,455
- around then.  - OK.

942
01:17:28,075 --> 01:17:31,975
Oh. Let me... I'm gonna help you with those.

943
01:17:33,059 --> 01:17:35,252
Got it.

944
01:17:35,447 --> 01:17:39,891
It's OK. It's OK, it's OK.

945
01:17:47,735 --> 01:17:49,921
None of that was here.

946
01:17:50,007 --> 01:17:52,776
This is all new.

947
01:18:03,034 --> 01:18:05,004
Really?

948
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:09,051
- Is that all you got?  - What?

949
01:18:15,476 --> 01:18:17,970
Give me a boost.

950
01:18:19,001 --> 01:18:21,165
Watch...

951
01:18:21,384 --> 01:18:23,838
Hang on.

952
01:18:30,227 --> 01:18:32,832
I took Geography in here.

953
01:18:33,007 --> 01:18:35,353
You ever fool around with one of your teachers?

954
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:39,924
- No. Did you?  - No. Not until college.

955
01:18:44,297 --> 01:18:47,086
That's me on the right.

956
01:18:48,218 --> 01:18:52,786
- It's kinda hard to tell.  - You can tell by the eyebrows.

957
01:18:52,997 --> 01:18:57,230
- You played basketball?  - I was a point guard. Don't act so surprised.

958
01:18:57,316 --> 01:19:00,777
I didn't know you were such a jock.

959
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:03,107
That's me too.

960
01:19:03,193 --> 01:19:06,150
And that.

961
01:19:07,641 --> 01:19:09,964
- My first fight.  - How'd it go?

962
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:12,509
Got my ass kicked.

963
01:19:12,595 --> 01:19:21,034
- This is where we used to go to make out.  - Oh, yes. Yeah. This is very romantic.

964
01:19:32,949 --> 01:19:37,458
- I'm really happy I came here.  - So am I.

965
01:19:43,072 --> 01:19:46,058
It's Kara. Hi.

966
01:19:46,293 --> 01:19:49,063
Ryan, where are you? We're having a meltdown here.

967
01:19:49,149 --> 01:19:50,246
What's going on? What happened?

968
01:19:50,332 --> 01:19:52,604
It's Jim. Can you get back here? We need your help.

969
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:55,036
OK.

970
01:19:55,806 --> 01:19:58,118
We gotta go.

971
01:20:00,831 --> 01:20:04,412
- I'll grab your suit.  - Thanks.

972
01:20:22,548 --> 01:20:25,258
- What happened?  - Jim's got cold feet.

973
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:27,995
- Today?  - Yeah, that's how cold feet work.

974
01:20:28,081 --> 01:20:31,122
- What do you want me to do?  - Talk to him.

975
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:34,100
- You want me to talk to him?  - Hey, it's either you or me.

976
01:20:34,186 --> 01:20:36,670
You know my track record. I've already struck out once.

977
01:20:36,756 --> 01:20:39,268
I haven't been to bat. I haven't been in the dugout.

978
01:20:39,354 --> 01:20:42,006
Don't you talk for a living? Motivational-type stuff?

979
01:20:42,092 --> 01:20:44,715
I tell people how to avoid commitment.

980
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:46,268
What fuck kind of message is that?

981
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:48,020
- It's a philosophy.  - It's stupid.

982
01:20:48,106 --> 01:20:51,250
- Hey, it could have helped you.  - Ryan.

983
01:20:51,336 --> 01:20:56,604
You haven't been around much. Fuck... Basically, you don't exist to us.

984
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:59,523
I know you wanna be there for her.

985
01:20:59,609 --> 01:21:04,015
Well, here it is. This is your chance.

986
01:21:24,467 --> 01:21:27,280
Hey. What's up, Ryan?

987
01:21:28,407 --> 01:21:31,739
- Jim.  - You ever read this before?

988
01:21:32,006 --> 01:21:36,768
- Yeah, it's pretty powerful stuff...  - I'll say...

989
01:21:39,117 --> 01:21:44,985
Er... Kara mentioned that you were having some thoughts.

990
01:21:45,132 --> 01:21:49,923
I don't think I'm going to be able to... er... to do this.

991
01:21:50,151 --> 01:21:53,916
Why would you say that... today?

992
01:21:54,221 --> 01:21:58,288
Well, last night I was kinda laying in bed and I couldn't get to sleep.

993
01:21:58,374 --> 01:22:01,697
So I started thinking about the wedding and the ceremony,

994
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:05,171
and about our buying a house and moving in together.

995
01:22:05,257 --> 01:22:09,090
And having a kid, and having another kid and then.

996
01:22:09,446 --> 01:22:11,758
Christmas and Thanksgiving and spring break.

997
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:15,318
Going to football games, and then all of a sudden they're graduating.

998
01:22:15,404 --> 01:22:19,440
They're getting jobs, getting married. And, you know, I'm a grandparent.

999
01:22:19,526 --> 01:22:22,847
And then I'm retired. I'm losing my hair. I'm getting fat.

1000
01:22:22,933 --> 01:22:25,403
And then the next thing you know I'm dead.

1001
01:22:25,489 --> 01:22:30,088
I'm just, like... I can't stop from thinking, what's the point?

1002
01:22:32,555 --> 01:22:35,608
I mean, what is the point?

1003
01:22:35,697 --> 01:22:40,678
- The point?  - I mean, what am I starting here?

1004
01:22:41,573 --> 01:22:45,027
Jim, it's... marriage.

1005
01:22:45,290 --> 01:22:49,756
It's one of the most beautiful things on the earth. It's what people aspire to.

1006
01:22:49,842 --> 01:22:52,740
- You never got married.  - That's true.

1007
01:22:52,826 --> 01:22:57,127
- I mean, you never even tried.  - Well, it's hard to define try.

1008
01:22:57,213 --> 01:23:01,687
I don't know, just you seem happier than all my married friends.

1009
01:23:03,271 --> 01:23:07,086
Look, Jim, I'm not going to lie to you. Marriage can be a pain in the ass.

1010
01:23:07,172 --> 01:23:11,955
And you're right. This all is just stuff that leads to your eventual demise.

1011
01:23:12,041 --> 01:23:14,097
- Yes.  - And we're all on running clocks.

1012
01:23:14,183 --> 01:23:17,525
And they can't be slowed down or paused.

1013
01:23:18,504 --> 01:23:21,965
- And... we all end up in the same place.  - Yeah.

1014
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:28,116
- There is no point.  - There is no point. That's what I'm saying.

1015
01:23:32,447 --> 01:23:35,100
You know, er...

1016
01:23:35,497 --> 01:23:39,758
I'm not normally the guy you would talk to about stuff like this.

1017
01:23:42,671 --> 01:23:45,336
If you think about it...

1018
01:23:46,518 --> 01:23:50,471
Your favourite memories, the most important moments in your life.

1019
01:23:50,762 --> 01:23:52,832
Were you alone?

1020
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:57,047
No, I guess not.

1021
01:23:57,374 --> 01:23:59,412
Come to think of it.

1022
01:23:59,498 --> 01:24:02,705
Last night, the night before your wedding when all this shit is swirling around in your head,

1023
01:24:02,791 --> 01:24:05,233
weren't you guys in separate bedroom?

1024
01:24:05,319 --> 01:24:10,651
Yeah, Julie went back to the apartment and I was just by myself in the honeymoon suite.

1025
01:24:10,737 --> 01:24:14,545
- Kinda lonely, huh?  - Yes, it was pretty lonely.

1026
01:24:15,617 --> 01:24:18,541
Life's better with company.

1027
01:24:19,441 --> 01:24:23,798
- Yeah...  - Everybody needs a co-pilot.

1028
01:24:25,059 --> 01:24:28,336
- That was a nice touch.  - Thanks.

1029
01:24:30,415 --> 01:24:35,265
- So er... what's the mood like out there?  - It's not good.

1030
01:24:35,351 --> 01:24:39,176
- She's pretty pissed?  - Just upset.

1031
01:24:40,418 --> 01:24:43,100
What should I do?

1032
01:24:44,455 --> 01:24:46,748
Go get her.

1033
01:25:00,443 --> 01:25:03,997
I'm such a fuck-up. I love you so much.

1034
01:25:04,083 --> 01:25:07,205
Will you be my co-pilot?

1035
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:11,825
Yes. Yes.

1036
01:25:16,004 --> 01:25:18,681
Welcome home.

1037
01:27:52,902 --> 01:27:56,915
OK, this is your stop.

1038
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:07,783
- When am I gonna see you?  - You're just gonna have to come visit.

1039
01:28:07,888 --> 01:28:10,685
Oh... so settled.

1040
01:28:11,256 --> 01:28:18,077
- You're not gonna change on me, are you?  - No. Same guy. Just one address.

1041
01:28:18,642 --> 01:28:24,103
This is your final boarding call for Flight 3972 to Chicago.

1042
01:28:25,002 --> 01:28:28,768
Right. Call me when you get lonely.

1043
01:28:31,054 --> 01:28:33,471
I'm lonely.

1044
01:29:05,919 --> 01:29:07,961
Some guy sits in a conference room somewhere

1045
01:29:08,047 --> 01:29:11,328
and our server routes his session to one of our termination engineers.

1046
01:29:11,414 --> 01:29:13,021
"Termination engineers"? Really?

1047
01:29:13,107 --> 01:29:15,755
I preferred "terminators" but it bumped with Legal.

1048
01:29:15,841 --> 01:29:17,225
Can't imagine why.

1049
01:29:17,311 --> 01:29:21,246
The workflow takes them through anything from a standard dismissal to a violent aggressor.

1050
01:29:21,332 --> 01:29:23,476
What are they doing now, practising?

1051
01:29:23,562 --> 01:29:28,103
Beta testing, role-playing. We go live at the end of the month.

1052
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:30,581
Kyle, you're running through the events too quickly.

1053
01:29:30,667 --> 01:29:34,511
Give them time to acknowledge each statement. It's a legal thing.

1054
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:38,759
- Ryan?  - Mm? Oh. Yeah. There's more?

1055
01:29:45,078 --> 01:29:46,333
This is ridiculous.

1056
01:29:46,419 --> 01:29:51,605
Legal's starting to come hard at me on this term "terminate"...

1057
01:30:17,354 --> 01:30:19,823
Life to the power of you!

1058
01:30:30,074 --> 01:30:33,212
Ladies and gentlemen. Put your hands together for today's challenge speaker,

1059
01:30:33,298 --> 01:30:36,260
Mr Ryan Bingham

1060
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:39,217
Go get 'em.

1061
01:30:49,091 --> 01:30:53,567
Last year I flew 350,000 miles.

1062
01:30:53,747 --> 01:30:56,360
The moon is 250.

1063
01:30:58,861 --> 01:31:03,240
I want you to imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack.

1064
01:31:03,326 --> 01:31:06,465
I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders.

1065
01:31:07,072 --> 01:31:09,192
You feel 'em?

1066
01:31:10,145 --> 01:31:15,638
Now I want you to pack it with all the stuff that you have in your life.

1067
01:31:16,017 --> 01:31:22,695
Start with the little things. The things on shelves and in drawers.

1068
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:43,708
Excuse me.

1069
01:31:46,499 --> 01:31:48,582
What the fuck are you doing?

1070
01:31:48,668 --> 01:31:51,622
Relax. We'll have your next guest out in one sec.

1071
01:32:15,341 --> 01:32:18,382
- Hey, you gotta sign.  - OK.

1072
01:32:19,391 --> 01:32:21,814
OK, thank you.

1073
01:32:24,171 --> 01:32:28,320
Hey, you forgot to give me your Hertz No.1 Gold Card!

1074
01:33:03,076 --> 01:33:05,785
So I was in the neighbourhood.

1075
01:33:20,444 --> 01:33:25,379
- Hey, honey, who's at the door?  - Just somebody who's lost.

1076
01:34:22,998 --> 01:34:24,198
Alex?

1077
01:34:24,284 --> 01:34:27,211
What were you thinking, showing up at my door like that?

1078
01:34:27,297 --> 01:34:31,156
What do you mean? I wanted to see you. I didn't know you had a family.

1079
01:34:31,242 --> 01:34:32,957
Why didn't you tell me that?

1080
01:34:33,043 --> 01:34:36,880
Sorry I ruined your evening but you could have screwed things up for me.

1081
01:34:36,966 --> 01:34:41,533
That's my family. That's my real life.

1082
01:34:43,111 --> 01:34:46,628
I thought I was a part of your real life.

1083
01:34:47,002 --> 01:34:50,126
I thought we signed up for the same thing.

1084
01:34:51,255 --> 01:34:56,061
Try and help me understand exactly what it is that you signed up for.

1085
01:34:56,496 --> 01:35:01,129
I thought our relationship was perfectly clear. I mean...

1086
01:35:01,215 --> 01:35:04,586
you are an escape.

1087
01:35:05,869 --> 01:35:08,602
You're a break from our normal lives, you're a...

1088
01:35:08,688 --> 01:35:11,748
a parenthesis.

1089
01:35:13,955 --> 01:35:15,677
I'm a parenthesis?

1090
01:35:15,763 --> 01:35:20,128
I mean... what do you want?

1091
01:35:21,211 --> 01:35:23,768
Tell me what you want.

1092
01:35:27,865 --> 01:35:30,616
You don't even know what you want.

1093
01:35:30,702 --> 01:35:35,107
Ryan, I'm a grown-up, OK?

1094
01:35:35,193 --> 01:35:40,580
So if you would like to see me again, then then give me a call.

1095
01:35:41,529 --> 01:35:43,807
OK?

1096
01:35:58,826 --> 01:36:01,810
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special announcement to make.

1097
01:36:01,896 --> 01:36:06,266
Our pilot has just informed me that we are passing over the city of Dubuque,

1098
01:36:06,352 --> 01:36:11,792
which might not mean much to most of you, but means a lot to one of our flyers today.

1099
01:36:11,878 --> 01:36:17,907
- Oh, no.  - Because he just hit 10 million miles!

1100
01:36:20,591 --> 01:36:23,627
- Congratulations.  - Such an amazing accomplishment.

1101
01:36:23,713 --> 01:36:26,443
You must be very excited.

1102
01:36:26,529 --> 01:36:28,940
- Hi, Captain.  - Captain.

1103
01:36:29,026 --> 01:36:31,345
That seat taken?

1104
01:36:31,431 --> 01:36:33,969
No. No.

1105
01:36:39,975 --> 01:36:43,338
You're the youngest yet to hit 10 mil.

1106
01:36:43,424 --> 01:36:46,418
Don't know where you found the time.

1107
01:36:46,504 --> 01:36:49,988
Yeah. I don't know.

1108
01:36:55,006 --> 01:36:57,156
Here you go.

1109
01:36:58,636 --> 01:37:01,589
Seventh card we've made.

1110
01:37:01,803 --> 01:37:04,296
Small club.

1111
01:37:05,895 --> 01:37:09,700
We really appreciate your loyalty.

1112
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:15,130
You know how many times I thought about this moment?

1113
01:37:17,033 --> 01:37:20,481
Played out the conversation that you and I would have right here.

1114
01:37:20,567 --> 01:37:22,748
Really?

1115
01:37:24,791 --> 01:37:27,692
What did you want to say?

1116
01:37:31,892 --> 01:37:34,529
You know, I don't remember.

1117
01:37:36,051 --> 01:37:40,777
That's all right. It happens to all of us.

1118
01:37:43,752 --> 01:37:46,326
So where are you from?

1119
01:37:51,873 --> 01:37:54,343
I'm from here.

1120
01:38:12,051 --> 01:38:14,380
Hello, Mr Bingham.

1121
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:16,571
How did you know it was me?

1122
01:38:16,657 --> 01:38:21,437
This is your dedicated line. We reserve them for our most loyal and appreciated flyers.

1123
01:38:21,523 --> 01:38:27,076
I'd like to transfer some of my miles. Can I open up an account to Jim and Julie Miller?

1124
01:38:27,162 --> 01:38:29,928
Certainly. How many miles would you like to transfer?

1125
01:38:30,014 --> 01:38:32,305
How many miles does it take to circle the globe?

1126
01:38:32,391 --> 01:38:36,667
We have our round-the-world tickets. They're 500,000 miles each.

1127
01:38:36,753 --> 01:38:38,396
- That'd be fine.  - Got a second?

1128
01:38:38,482 --> 01:38:39,932
I'll call you back.

1129
01:38:40,018 --> 01:38:42,587
What happened to you yesterday? I was trying to get hold of you.

1130
01:38:42,673 --> 01:38:46,506
I was some personal stuff. What's going on?

1131
01:38:46,592 --> 01:38:49,037
Do you remember Karen Barnes,

1132
01:38:49,710 --> 01:38:52,895
part of a 30-person reduction a few weeks back in Wichita?

1133
01:38:52,981 --> 01:38:58,042
- Natalie fired her.  - Fired dozens of people a day. I...

1134
01:38:58,128 --> 01:39:01,193
She killed herself... jumped off a bridge.

1135
01:39:02,795 --> 01:39:04,224
Fuck.

1136
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:08,632
I need to know if you remember any woman that gave you any signals,

1137
01:39:08,718 --> 01:39:11,844
- depression...  - They're all depressed. We're firing them.

1138
01:39:11,930 --> 01:39:17,308
- Hey, I need to ask you this stuff, OK?  - No, I don't remember anything.

1139
01:39:17,687 --> 01:39:20,858
You never think that they're...

1140
01:39:21,423 --> 01:39:23,282
You don't remember any woman that gave you any signals?

1141
01:39:23,368 --> 01:39:27,684
- Anything at all, Ryan?  - No, nothing stands out.

1142
01:39:30,293 --> 01:39:34,242
- Is Natalie all right?  - Natalie quit.

1143
01:39:37,224 --> 01:39:41,138
- She quit?  - Text message.

1144
01:39:41,581 --> 01:39:45,259
Fucking nice, right? No-one's got any manners any more.

1145
01:39:45,345 --> 01:39:50,312
- Did she say where she was going?  - No. She was a little upset.

1146
01:39:51,556 --> 01:39:54,154
I should give her a call.

1147
01:39:56,867 --> 01:39:59,936
I need you back in the air.

1148
01:40:02,609 --> 01:40:05,779
Hey. Did you hear what I said? I thought you'd be thrilled about that.

1149
01:40:05,865 --> 01:40:08,841
It's fine. What about the videoconferencing?

1150
01:40:08,927 --> 01:40:15,048
CTC is going to pause the new media front. They're gonna give it some more thought.

1151
01:40:15,134 --> 01:40:19,678
We are gonna get our workhorses back in the air doing what they do best, OK?

1152
01:40:20,876 --> 01:40:23,168
How long are you sending me out?

1153
01:40:23,254 --> 01:40:28,395
We're gonna let you sail and sail. You send us a postcard if you ever get there.

1154
01:40:42,042 --> 01:40:44,670
So what happened?

1155
01:40:45,653 --> 01:40:47,924
How exactly do you mean?

1156
01:40:48,010 --> 01:40:50,276
You graduated top of your class.

1157
01:40:50,362 --> 01:40:53,044
You seemed to have your pick of employment, including here.

1158
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:57,902
Instead you went to Omaha to fire people for a living?

1159
01:40:59,281 --> 01:41:02,164
- It's challenging work.  - I'll say!

1160
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:05,203
I can't imagine doing that, day in, day out.

1161
01:41:05,289 --> 01:41:07,582
Not in this climate.

1162
01:41:09,077 --> 01:41:11,874
I followed a boy.

1163
01:41:15,523 --> 01:41:18,792
I guess everybody does that at one point or another.

1164
01:41:24,241 --> 01:41:26,657
This guy says I'd be lucky to have you.

1165
01:41:26,743 --> 01:41:28,975
To whom it may concern.

1166
01:41:29,061 --> 01:41:32,129
I can't even count the number of people I've fired in my lifetime.

1167
01:41:32,215 --> 01:41:35,823
So many that I've actually forgotten what it's like to hire somebody.

1168
01:41:35,909 --> 01:41:40,925
We've never met, but I know you'd be lucky to have Natalie Keener.

1169
01:41:41,011 --> 01:41:43,851
My advice? Take her and don't look back.

1170
01:41:43,937 --> 01:41:47,627
She'll be the best decision you've made in a long time.

1171
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:54,091
I sure hope he's right.

1172
01:42:04,997 --> 01:42:06,920
Well, I don't have a lot of hope,

1173
01:42:07,006 --> 01:42:09,624
and I really don't know when it's gonna get better.

1174
01:42:09,710 --> 01:42:12,354
There's a lot of people unemployed.

1175
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:17,637
And I really don't know when there's gonna be light at the end of the tunnel.

1176
01:42:17,723 --> 01:42:19,387
I can't find much to talk about.

1177
01:42:19,473 --> 01:42:22,323
Talk about being proud. I'm proud of my kids.

1178
01:42:22,409 --> 01:42:27,533
I think the anger comes from the fact that I just wasn't needed any more.

1179
01:42:27,619 --> 01:42:29,782
I would say, you know, uh...

1180
01:42:29,868 --> 01:42:32,592
without my friends and my family,

1181
01:42:32,678 --> 01:42:34,492
I wouldn't have made it.

1182
01:42:34,578 --> 01:42:37,388
It would have been a lot tougher if I'd had to make it on my own.

1183
01:42:37,474 --> 01:42:41,721
When I wake up in the morning and I look over and I see my wife,

1184
01:42:41,807 --> 01:42:44,723
that gives me the sense of purpose.

1185
01:42:44,809 --> 01:42:47,695
It's not all about the money. Money can keep you warm.

1186
01:42:47,781 --> 01:42:52,136
It pays your heating bills. It can buy you a blanket.

1187
01:42:53,004 --> 01:42:57,355
But it doesn't keep you as warm as when my husband holds me.

1188
01:42:57,441 --> 01:43:02,192
Let me get up. Let me get out. Let me find something.

1189
01:43:02,565 --> 01:43:07,524
So my kids are my purpose. My family.

1190
01:43:36,193 --> 01:43:41,380
Tonight most people will be welcomed home by jumping dogs and squealing kids.

1191
01:43:41,856 --> 01:43:46,213
Their spouses will ask about their day and tonight they'll sleep.

1192
01:43:46,765 --> 01:43:51,450
The stars will wheel forth from their daytime hiding places.

1193
01:43:52,269 --> 01:43:55,476
And one of those lights, slightly brighter than the rest,

1194
01:43:55,727 --> 01:43:59,692
will be my wing tip passing over.

1195
01:46:09,044 --> 01:46:14,744
Hi, Jason. My name is Kevin. And I recently lost my job.

1196
01:46:14,867 --> 01:46:20,768
I wrote this song as sort of a statement about uncertainty

1197
01:46:20,854 --> 01:46:24,224
and having a certain amount of anxiety about the future.

1198
01:46:24,907 --> 01:46:27,969
So maybe you can use it in your movie.
