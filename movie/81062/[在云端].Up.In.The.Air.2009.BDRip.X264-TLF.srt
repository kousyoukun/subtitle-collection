But it doesn't keep you as warm as when my husband holds me.

Let me get up. Let me get out. Let me find something.

So my kids are my purpose. My family.

Tonight most people will be welcomed home by jumping dogs and squealing kids.

The stars will wheel forth from their daytime hiding places.

And one of those lights, slightly brighter than the rest,

I wrote this song as sort of a statement about uncertainty

and having a certain amount of anxiety about the future.
